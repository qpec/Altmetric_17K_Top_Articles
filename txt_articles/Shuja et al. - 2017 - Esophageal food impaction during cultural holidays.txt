Abstract
Background: Although intrinsic risk factors contributing to esophageal food impaction are well established, whether social
behavior affects its occurrence has not yet been examined.
Methods: We conducted a retrospective review of the gastroenterology endoscopy procedural documentation software for
the period of 2001–2012 to identify all patients who presented to our emergency department for esophageal foreign-body re-
moval at the time of national athletic events and holidays associated with dietary indiscretions.
Results: We found that adults undergoing emergent esophagogastroduodenoscopy during periods celebrating cultural holi-
days and national athletic events were more likely to experience esophageal food impaction compared with those undergo-
ing emergent endoscopy during periods not associated with these events (36.8% vs 3.6%; P < 0.001): a 10-fold increase.
During a national holiday/athletic event period, the most common impacted food item was turkey (50%) followed by
chicken (29%) and beef (21%).
Conclusions: Esophageal food impaction is more likely to occur on American holidays and national athletic events and is as-
sociated with large meals. Patients with intrinsic risk factors should be advised to modify their diet during cultural events
associated with tachyphagia and large meals to prevent esophageal food impaction.

Introduction
Esophageal food impaction is a medical emergency requiring
timely endoscopic intervention. Patients presenting with food
bolus impaction frequently have predisposing esophageal pa-
thology directly causing the impaction. Underlying risk factors
include peptic stricture, eosinophilic esophagitis, Schatzki ring,
achalasia and malignancy [1,2]. While these contributing intrin-
sic risk factors are well-established, it is unknown whether so-
cial
behavior
affects

impaction.

 stressful match more than doubled the risk of an acute cardio-
vascular event. The study was performed to examine the rela-
tionship
between
emotional
stress
and
the
incidence
of
cardiovascular events during the Soccer World Cup in 2006 [3].
Current data on the rate of food bolus impaction in relation to
sports and cultural events are scant. The purpose of our retro-
spective cross-sectional study was to assess the characteristics
of patients presenting to a tertiary care center with esophageal
food impaction and to evaluate whether there is a temporal re-
lationship with these events. We hypothesized that cultural
holidays and national athletic events were associated with die-
tary indiscretions, which would lead to increased rates of
esophageal food impaction.
Methods
We queried the gastroenterology endoscopy procedural docu-
mentation software (ProVation
V
R
Medical, Minneapolis, MN)
at St. Elizabeth’s Medical Center to identify adults who pre-
sented for emergent esophagogastroduodenoscopy between
2001 and 2012. Patients undergoing endoscopic removal of an
esophageal foreign body were identified using the International
Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification
(ICD-9-CM) code 935.1 (foreign body in esophagus). Cases of
esophageal food impaction were included, and those of other
ingested foreign bodies were excluded. We defined an index pe-
riod (national holiday/athletic event) of three days starting on
the day of a holiday event (Thanksgiving, Christmas and New
Year’s day) or national athletic event (Super Bowl and last
game of the World Series), and two control periods (subse-
quently grouped into a combined control period) each of a
three-day duration starting 14 days before and 14 days after the
listed cultural and athletic events (Figure 1). The three-day
timeline was created to account for potential late presentation
of esophageal food impaction. Demographic, clinical and endo-
scopic characteristics were extracted from medical records in-
cluding age, sex, ethnicity, impacted food type, comorbid
conditions, endoscopy type and intervention, procedural com-
plications and biopsy findings. Esophageal food impaction rates
were calculated for each observation period. Comparisons were
conducted using the t test for continuous variables and the chi-
square or Fisher’s exact test for categorical variables, using the
SPSS statistical package. A P value < 0.05 was considered statis-
tically significant.
Results
Over a period of 11 years, 38 patients underwent emergent esoph-
agogastroduodenoscopy during the index period (national holi-
day/athletic event) and 81 patients during the control period.
Patients presenting during the index period were more likely to be
men and appeared to be younger and have a higher prevalence of
hiatal hernia compared with those presenting during the control
period (Table 1). The period prevalence of esophageal food impac-
tion was significantly higher during the index period compared
with the control period (36.8% vs. 3.6%; P < 0.001; Figure 2).
During the index period, 10 (71%) of the 14 patients present-
ing with esophageal food impaction were men with a mean age
of 58 years. Six cases were observed on Thanksgiving, five on
Christmas, two on New Year’s day and only one on the last
game of the World Series. During the index period, the most
common impacted food item was turkey (50%), followed by
chicken (29%) and beef (21%), compared with beef (67%) fol-
lowed by chicken (33%) during the control period. The most
common site of food impaction was the lower third of the
esophagus. All 14 patients received intravenous glucagon,
which was unsuccessful in clearing the food bolus prior to en-
doscopy. Food disimpaction was successfully achieved by flexi-
ble esophagogastroduodenoscopy in 11 (79%) patients. The
remaining three (21%) patients required rigid esophagogastro-
duodenoscopy in the operating room under general anesthesia
as one patient developed bradycardia, one patient had an ani-
mal bone adherent to the esophageal wall, and one patient had
extrinsic esophageal compression that prevented passage of the
flexible endoscope. The push (seven patients), pull (three pa-
tients) or combined push-pull (four patients) technique was
used to disimpact the food bolus. None of the patients required
esophageal dilation. An overtube was used in two cases,
whereas a banding device, air insufflation and a snare were
used in one case each for food extraction. One patient experi-
enced bradycardia, and one patient had linear erosions that
were likely secondary to the procedure. There was no perfora-
tion, aspiration, significant bleeding or death related to either
the endoscopic intervention or the impacted food bolus. Two bi-
opsies were performed, with one revealing eosinophilic esopha-
gitis. One patient had a prior history of esophageal food
impaction. The average hospital length of stay was 1.5 days,
and most patients were discharged on the same day.
During the control period, three women presented with
esophageal food impaction; one episode occurred in a patient
who ate steak tips in our emergency department after having
presented for acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmo-
nary disease; one patient had known esophageal stricture re-
quiring frequent balloon dilation, and one patient had a Schatzki
ring and large hiatal hernia. No complications were reported.
Discussion
Esophageal food impaction is a not infrequent emergency that
requires timely intervention. The pathophysiology of impaction
is often attributed to predisposing esophageal pathology, the na-
ture of ingested food or both [1]. Our retrospective study explored
the effect of the latter variable by hypothesizing that the inci-
dence of food impaction increased during such events where
larger-than-typical meals are likely to be consumed. Over an
11-year period, we found that patients undergoing emergency
esophagogastroduodenoscopy during periods celebrating cul-
tural holidays and national athletic events were more likely to
experience esophageal food impaction (a 10-fold increase com-
pared with periods not associated with these events). Over the
past decade, the prevalence of esophageal food impaction has
steadily increased by more than 6-fold [2], affecting younger in-
dividuals [4]. This might be due in part to an increasing preva-
lence rate of eosinophilic esophagitis, a condition which poses a

 risk for food impaction and is more common in younger patients
[5,6]. Most patients presenting with esophageal food impaction
in our series were men, as previously shown [1,4]. Benign peptic
strictures and eosinophilic esophagitis are more common in
men [7].
While the most commonly involved food item tends to be
meat [8], this observation varies according to the cuisine of the
geographic area. In our series, 50% of the cases during the index
period had turkey meat as the impacted food bolus, which was
likely related to the Thanksgiving celebration. The size or vol-
ume of the meal and the speed of food ingestion or tachyphagia
increase substantially at the time of cultural holidays and na-
tional athletic events, which might be contributing factors.
Additional possible risk factors include higher alcohol con-
sumption. Competitive speed eating, such as participation in
hot dog-eating contests, represents an extreme human behav-
ior where competitive eaters ingest large volumes of food [9].
While this activity might contribute to food impaction, short-
term radiological studies demonstrate that successful speed
eaters expand their stomach to form an enormous flaccid sac
capable of accommodating large amounts of food [10]. However,
there are no published studies on the long-term effects of speed
eating on its competitors.
The American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy rec-
ommends emergent removal of an esophageal-impacted food
item leading to complete obstruction. The recommended man-
agement includes flexible esophagogastroduodenoscopy with
en-bloc or piecemeal removal or gentle advancement [11].
The push technique is the initial treatment of choice and is con-
sidered to be safe and highly successful [12].
Our study has several strengths. It spans more than 11 years
and to our knowledge is the first report of its kind comparing
rates of food impaction in relation to cultural holidays and na-
tional athletic events. Caution must be exercised by the general
public—especially among those who have had previous esopha-
geal food impaction or those at risk—to eat judiciously and in
small boluses to prevent occurrence of this emergency. Among
patients with intrinsic risk factors for esophageal food impac-
tion, these occasional dietary indiscretions might trigger food
impaction and should prompt appropriate dietary education for
at-risk patients.
Limitations of our single-center study include its retrospec-
tive nature with a relatively small sample size. A larger sam-
pling across multiple geographic areas would validate our
preliminary observations. Only two of the 14 patients under-
went a biopsy, which limited our ability to assess for eosino-
philic esophagitis.
In conclusion, we have demonstrated a 10-fold increase in
the rate of esophageal food impaction during cultural holidays
and national athletic events compared with periods not associ-
ated with these events. Patients with known intrinsic risk fac-
tors should be advised to modify their diet during such events
to minimize their risk of esophageal food impaction.
