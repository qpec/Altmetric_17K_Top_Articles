Certain visual images, even in the absence of motion or flicker, can trigger seizures in 
patients with photosensitive epilepsy. As of yet, there is no systematic explanation as to why 
some static images are likely to provoke seizures, while others pose little or no risk. Here, 
we examined the neurophysiology literature to assess whether the pattern of neural 
responses in healthy visual cortex is predictive of the pathological responses in 
photosensitive epilepsy. Previous studies have suggested that gamma oscillations (30-80 Hz) 
measured in human visual cortex may play a role in seizure generation [1, 2]. Recently, we 
and others have shown that increases in gamma band power can come from two very 
different cortical signals, one that is oscillatory (with a narrow peak between 30 Hz and 80 
Hz), and another that is broadband [3]. The oscillatory signal arises from neuronal 
synchrony in the local population, while the broadband signal reflects the level of 
asynchronous neuronal activity, and is correlated with multiunit spiking [4]. These two 
responses have different biological origins and different selectivity for image properties. 
Here, we followed up on the previous proposals [1, 2] to ask whether the image features that 
increase seizure likelihood in photosensitive epilepsy are linked to narrowband gamma 
oscillations specifically, or are associated with any kind of increase in visual activity. Based 
on published work, we compared pairs of image classes on a number of dimensions, and 
show that the type of image that elicits larger narrowband gamma oscillations in healthy 
visual cortex is also more likely to provoke seizures or pre-seizure activity in patients with 
photosensitive epilepsy. In contrast, images that elicit larger broadband, multiunit, or fMRI 
responses are much less predictive of seizure activity. We propose that a risk factor for 
seizures in patients with photosensitive epilepsy is engagement of the circuitry that produces 
gamma oscillations.
Photosensitivity, defined as an abnormal response in the electroencephalogram (EEG) 
triggered by light stimulation, is common and is found in 0.3-3% of the population [5].

 Photosensitive epilepsy, where light stimulation causes seizures, has a prevalence of 1 in 
10,000 individuals (or 1/4,000 between ages 5-24) [5]. Highly provocative stimuli can occur 
in the natural environment, on TV and in computer games. In the Pokémon incident in 1997, 
for example, one Pokémon episode resulted in seizures and hospital visits for 685 people in 
Japan. In a separate incident, a video for the 2012 Olympics was removed from the website 
because it caused seizures. Patients with photosensitive epilepsy are advised to avoid 
provocative stimuli.
Neuroscientists and neurologists have started to detail the visual input that can trigger a 
seizure. Repetitive flashes are well known for their potential to induce seizures, but 
stationary patterns can also elicit seizures in about 30% of patients with photosensitive 
epilepsy [6]. Large, high contrast gratings of 2-4 cycles per degree are most provocative to 
elicit abnormal, epileptiform, responses in the EEG signal, the photoparoxysmal response 
(PPR, which is the clinical marker for photosensitivity); looking at these gratings for more 
than 500 ms can trigger a seizure. Several image features influence the degree to which a 
stimulus is provocative (Table 1). The likelihood that a PPR is induced by viewing a grating 
can be reduced by decreasing the size of the grating, by reducing the contrast, by 
superimposing a second grating to create a plaid or checkerboard, or by superimposing 
noise. Both sine and square wave gratings are provocative whereas chromatic contrast alone 
(isoluminant gratings) is not.
A comprehensive overview of the neurophysiology literature indicates that the same image 
properties that can trigger seizures also elicit gamma oscillations in the local field potential 
in visual cortex. Gamma oscillations are most strongly driven by large, high contrast 
gratings and can be reduced in amplitude by decreasing the size of the grating, by reducing 
the contrast, by superimposing a second grating to create a plaid or checkerboard, or by 
superimposing noise [7]. In addition, gamma oscillations in visual cortex peak at a spatial 
frequency around 2-4 cycles per degree, sine and square wave gratings both induce gamma 
oscillations, and isoluminant gratings induce little or no gamma oscillations [8]. These 
stimulus features are highly similar to those that are provocative to induce seizures in 
photosensitive epilepsy (Table 1; additional references from the original reports are in 
Supplemental Table S1).
Importantly, the stimulus manipulations that increase both gamma oscillations and PPRs 
differ from those that increase multiunit firing rates [7] and the fMRI Blood Oxygen Level 
Dependent (‘BOLD’) response (Table 1). For example, gamma oscillations increase with 
larger stimuli, while the level of local neuronal firing and BOLD amplitude decrease (due to 
surround suppression). When a grating is converted to a plaid by overlaying additional 
orientations, gamma oscillations decrease, while increasing neuronal population firing rates 
and the BOLD signal. Superimposing white noise on a grating decreases gamma oscillations 
while not influencing firing rates. Chromatic contrast (e.g., an isoluminant grating) elicits 
high firing rates and a large BOLD response, but does not elicit a large gamma oscillation 
[8]. The stimuli that are most provocative in photosensitive epilepsy therefore match the 
stimuli that strongly drive gamma oscillations, and do not match the stimuli that strongly 
drive the overall level of neuronal firing or the metabolic demand as measured by BOLD 
fMRI.

 This review focuses on the link between photosensitive epilepsy and gamma oscillations 
induced by spatial features of images. Narrowband gamma oscillations are highly dependent 
on the visual stimulus [3, 7] and these oscillations are associated with engagement of 
specific types of cells and circuitry in visual cortex (e.g., [12, 13]). We hypothesize that 
engagement of this circuitry is a factor that increases the likelihood of seizure activity, 
perhaps because this circuit does not self-stabilize in some patients with photosensitive 
epilepsy. Stroboscopic (mean field) flicker across many frequencies (3 Hz to 60 Hz) can also 
be highly provocative in photosensitive epilepsy (Supplemental Table S2). Periodic stimuli 
elicit periodic responses; however, it is unclear whether these stimuli also engage the same 
specialized circuitry that produces induced (non-stimulus-locked) gamma oscillations. 
Hence the mechanism by which flicker induces seizure activity remains an important topic 
for further exploration.
We still know little about the underlying mechanisms of photosensitive epilepsy, in part 
because there is no animal model that translates well to humans1 and because there is no 
experimental paradigm for studying risk factors for photosensitive epilepsy in healthy 
human subjects. In contrast, neither of these limitations applies to gamma oscillations. The 
circuitry involved in gamma oscillations in visual cortex is extensively studied at the cellular 
level in animal models, at the systems level in healthy human subjects, and at the level of 
computational modeling. In particular, studies at all of these levels propose that the 
interaction between excitatory neurons and inhibitory interneurons is important for the 
generation of gamma oscillations [9] and fast spiking basket interneurons have resonant 
properties in the gamma frequencies and are hypothesized to play a role in gamma 
oscillations. Moreover, animal recordings have shown that large stimuli compared to small 
stimuli increase the power of gamma oscillations, and drive fast spiking interneurons more 
strongly [10]. Competing computational models (reviewed in [9]) have different implications 
for the type of stimuli and neuronal states that are likely to modulate the level of gamma 
oscillations in healthy visual cortex. If our conjecture is correct, then a critical question to 
address is why engagement of this circuitry leads to seizures or atypical responses in the 
EEG in some people, but not in others. Therefore, the tools used to study gamma oscillations 
– at the computational, cellular, circuit, and systems level - might be marshaled to explain 
not only why gamma synchrony occurs, but also how excessive synchrony can occur in 
epilepsy.

Table 1
The image features that are most provocative in photosensitive epilepsy (expressed as photo-paroxysmal responses (PPR) in the EEG), are 
also the most likely to induce large gamma oscillations
When image properties vary according to the exemplars (changes in size, contrast, number of orientations, luminance/chromatic, spatial frequency, sine 
wave to square wave, adding noise) the number of PPR in photosensitive patients change in the same way as the amplitude of the gamma oscillations. 
Multiunit activity and the fMRI BOLD response change in a different manner. The direction of the arrows indicates increases or decreases, and a 
desaturated arrow indicates variable evidence. For gamma oscillations, spiking activity and BOLD responses, we assess an increase or decrease as the 
change in response of the neural population representing the stimulus center, not the signal pooled over all of visual cortex. Additional notes are provided 
in the Supplemental Table S1. This table includes spatial stimulus features from which the effects on provocativeness in epilepsy, induced gamma 
oscillations and firing rates have been described (see the Supplemental Table S1 and Table S2 for some additional stimulus features).
