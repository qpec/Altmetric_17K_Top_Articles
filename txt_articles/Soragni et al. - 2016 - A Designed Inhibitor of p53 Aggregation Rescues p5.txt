SUMMARY
Half of all human cancers lose p53 function by missense mutations, with an unknown fraction of these con-
taining p53 in a self-aggregated amyloid-like state. Here we show that a cell-penetrating peptide, ReACp53,
designed to inhibit p53 amyloid formation, rescues p53 function in cancer cell lines and in organoids derived
from high-grade serous ovarian carcinomas (HGSOC), an aggressive cancer characterized by ubiquitous p53
mutations. Rescued p53 behaves similarly to its wild-type counterpart in regulating target genes, reducing
cell proliferation and increasing cell death. Intraperitoneal administration decreases tumor proliferation
and shrinks xenografts in vivo. Our data show the effectiveness of targeting a specific aggregation defect
of p53 and its potential applicability to HGSOCs.
INTRODUCTION
p53 is a tumor suppressor of paramount importance and the
most frequently mutated protein in human cancers (Lane and
Crawford, 1979; Levine and Oren, 2009; Linzer and Levine,
1979). It arrests proliferation and promotes either DNA repair or
apoptosis in cells with DNA damage or under stresses such as
hypoxia or starvation (Vazquez et al., 2008; Vousden and Ryan,
2009). In over half of all tumors, p53 is inactivated by a single
point mutation, most frequently in the DNA binding domain.
These mutations inactivate the protein, either by altering a resi-
due that directly contacts DNA (contact mutants) or by mutating
a residue that destabilizes and partially unfolds p53 (structural
mutants), although the separation between classes is not abso-
lute (Joerger and Fersht, 2008).
Depending on cancer type, the percentage of cases bearing
p53 mutations varies. One of the subtypes presenting with the
highest prevalence are high-grade serous ovarian carcinomas
(HGSOC), where mutations are reported in >96% of cases (Can-
cer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2011; Ahmed et al.,
Significance
Among all cancers, HGSOC has the highest rate of p53 mutations and no curative therapies, so it is an ideal test system for
p53-reactivating molecules such as ReACp53. Because aggregation of p53 has been observed in a variety of tumors,
ReACp53 can also be applied to other cancers. By inhibiting p53 aggregation, ReACp53 alters the dynamic equilibrium be-
tween folded, partially unfolded, and aggregated p53, re-instating a pool of functional wild-type-like protein capable of
driving tumor regression. ReACp53 rescues the function of two of the most commonly mutated residues, R175 and
R248. While many mutants may aggregate and respond to ReACp53, these two alone are present in tumors of
�80,000 U.S. patients/year, who could potentially benefit from a p53-aggregation inhibition therapy.

 2010). Ovarian cancer is the most lethal of all gynecologic can-
cers and the fifth most common cause of cancer-related death
among women in the United States (Siegel et al., 2014). About
80% of all ovarian cancers are of the high-grade serous type,
mostly diagnosed at advanced stages with poor long-term prog-
nosis (Seidman et al., 2004). Despite surgical debulking and
administration of platinum-based chemotherapy, almost all pa-
tients suffer from recurrent and disseminated disease and the
majority dies in less than 5 years (Vaughan et al., 2011). Efforts
aimed at developing new therapeutic approaches have largely
been unsuccessful. An early event in carcinogenesis, p53 inacti-
vation through mutation is associated with poor response to
treatment and poor prognosis (Kurman and Shih, 2008; Leitao
et al., 2004). Although p53 alterations are so prevalent in ovarian
cancer, there is as of yet no targeted therapy approved for
restoring p53 function.
Over the past decade, p53 and fragments thereof have been
shown to aggregate in vitro (Silva et al., 2014). More recently,
several p53 mutants were found as amyloid aggregates in tumor
cell lines (Xu et al., 2011) and breast cancer biopsies (Levy et al.,
2011). These aggregates inactivate p53 by sequestering the pro-
tein, thus blocking its transcriptional activity and pro-apoptotic
function (Xu et al., 2011).
Our working hypothesis based on the behavior of other amy-
loid-forming proteins (Eisenberg and Jucker, 2012), is that
each aggregation-promoting mutation initially destabilizes the
native protein structure causing exposure of an adhesive
sequence (Wang and Fersht, 2012). This segment binds to alike
segments from other p53 molecules, resulting in protein aggre-
gation and inactivation. The following questions related to p53
aggregation are presently unanswered: (1) Can inhibition of
p53 aggregation in these cells rescue normal p53 function? (2)
Does such reactivation halt cell proliferation and diminish tumor
size in vivo? (3) Does reactivation of p53 avoid on-target toxic-
ities in normal tissues?
Here we address these questions by designing a cell-perme-
able 17-residue peptide inhibitor of p53 aggregation. Reflecting
the intended function of this inhibitor as a rescuer of the activity
of p53, we call it ReACp53.
RESULTS
p53 Amyloid Spine Structure and Its Use to Design a
Sequence-Specific Aggregation Inhibitor
Several segments in the DNA binding domain of p53 are prone to
form an amyloid adhesive segment, termed a steric zipper, as
calculated by the ZipperDB algorithm, which identified residues
252–258 as the most aggregation prone in this region (Figure 1A,
Goldschmidt et al., 2010). Segment 251–257 has been reported
as necessary and sufficient to drive p53 aggregation in cell lines
(Ghosh et al., 2014; Xu et al., 2011). We focused on the two
partially overlapping segments 252-LTIITLE-258 and 253-
TIITLE-258, and chemically synthesized them. Both formed
amyloid-like fibrils and microcrystals that enabled their structure
determination at atomic resolution (Sawaya et al., 2007; Figure S1
and Table S1). The segments aggregated as tight, dry steric zip-
pers, with LTIITLE forming a class 2, face-to-back amyloid spine
while TIITLE formed a class 1, face-to-face interface. Since both
shared similar side-chain contacts, we were able to design an in-
hibitor that can interact with both and block further aggregation.
Next, we implemented a modified rational approach to design
a peptidic inhibitor starting from the LTIITLE structure (Sievers
et al., 2011). In order to maximize sequence specificity and
avoid off-target effects, we kept the original p53 sequence, but
included single or double aggregation-inhibiting residues such
as K or R (Ghosh et al., 2014; Ha
¨ rd and Lendel, 2012) in critical
positions as judged by the side-chain arrangement in the LTIITLE
structure we determined. Various residues were replaced in po-
sition 1, 3, and 5 (Table S2), and segments were computationally
analyzed with Rosetta to score their structural complementarity

ZipperDB
(http://services.mbi.ucla.edu/

DNA-binding domain as aggregation prone. The
highest propensity ones are located in the 252–
258 region. Colored bars indicate aggregation-
prone segments with Rosetta energies below
�23 kcal/mol.
(B) The 252–258 segment (red) is mapped on the
p53 DNA-binding domain structure. The segment
in yellow (residues 213–217) is the epitope recog-
nized by the PAb240 antibody, which binds to
partially unfolded p53. Both segments are buried in
the p53 structure when the protein is fully folded.
DNA is in gold.
(C) The ReACp53 peptide (ball-and-stick; cyan,
blue, and red represent carbon, nitrogen, and
oxygen atoms, respectively) is modeled on the
p53252–258 amyloid steric zipper structure deter-
mined in this study (PDB: 4RP6). The arginine in
position 3 (in yellow) creates a steric clash with the adjacent b sheet and additionally impedes incoming molecules from adhering on top while binding to the steric
zipper below. Three adjacent b sheets (in gray and red) of the p53 amyloid spine structure are shown viewed down (left) or nearly perpendicular to the fibril axis
(right).

 to the original template (Leaver-Fay et al., 2011). Candidate pep-
tides were screened for their ability to inhibit aggregation of the
target sequence in vitro and for specificity, and the best candi-
date with sequence LTRITLE was selected for further studies.
When mapped onto the atomic structure of the LTIITLE segment,
the arginine substitution in position 3 clashes with the binding
of additional LTIITLE molecules (Figure 1C). Experiments
confirmed that LTRITLE efficiently blocks peptide aggregation
in vitro (Figure S1G), with marked effects at substoichiometric
concentrations. Although full-length p53 harboring the I254R
mutation does not aggregate in cells (Xu et al., 2011), there is
no guarantee that an exogenously administered LTRITLE pep-
tide may work as an efficient inhibitor so we proceeded to test
this hypothesis. We fused the peptide to an N-terminal poly-
arginine cell-penetrating tag (R = 9; Fuchs and Raines, 2005), fol-
lowed by a three-residue linker derived from the p53 sequence
(RPI) and tested this candidate, ReACp53, in cells.
ReACp53 Penetrates into HGSOC Primary Cancer Cells
and Converts Mutant p53 from a Punctate State into
Soluble Wild-type-like p53
We isolated primary cells from a cohort of HGSOC patients
(n = 7, Table S3) bearing various p53 mutations. We confirmed
that ReACp53 could enter the cells by chemically coupling it to
a fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) moiety. Cells treated with
10 mM FITC-labeled peptide for 16–20 hr in serum-free medium
showed intracellular and intranuclear staining, indicative of
ReACp53 penetration (Figures 2A, S2A, S2B, and S2E).
When primary cells grown on coverslips were stained for p53,
all patient samples harboring the R248Q mutation exhibited

 cytosolic, punctate staining with little nuclear p53 (Figures 2A,
2B, and S2A). This suggests that in these clinical samples grown
as monolayers, mutant p53 mostly self-associates in the cytosol.
After 16–20 hr of ReACp53 treatment, the proportion of cells with
p53 puncta was reduced to 5%–20%, and p53 could now be de-
tected in the nucleus in 70%–100% of cells, depending on the
patient (Figures 2A and 2B). The absence of aggregated cyto-
solic p53 together with the shift in localization suggests that
p53 was disaggregated and possibly restored to a functional
form. We confirmed this by staining a stable cell line we estab-
lished from HGSOC patient 1 (called S1 GODL; Janzen et al.,
2015) with either DO-1 or PAb240 anti-p53 antibodies in the
presence of increasing concentrations of ReACp53. DO-1 rec-
ognizes any p53, regardless of conformation, while PAb240 is
specific for partially unfolded p53. Because partially unfolded
p53 is required for protein aggregation, we used PAb240 as a
surrogate marker for aggregated p53. As visible in Figures 2C
and 2D, there is less PAb240 binding upon ReACp53 treatment,
despite the presence of p53 in the cells as indicated by DO-1
staining, while the scrambled peptide control did not have any
effect (Figure S2C). Immunoprecipitation with PAb240 using
native lysates from vehicle- or ReACp53-treated S1 GODL cells
gave analogous results (Figure S2D). Collectively, these data
indicate that the antigen recognized by PAb240 (residues 213–
217, Figure 1B) is now buried in the protein core and no longer
accessible.
ReACp53 Induces Cancer Cell Death, Cell-Cycle Arrest,
and Results in p53 Degradation
Next, we evaluated the effects of ReACp53 on cell viability using
OVCAR3 and S1 GODL cells. ReACp53 reduced cell viability in a
concentration-dependent manner, while a control sequence-
scrambled ReACp53 or the poly-arginine tag alone was ineffec-
tive (Figures 3A, 3B, and S3A). The peptide was also effective in
the presence of increasing concentrations of serum (Figure 3A),
albeit with lower effective concentration (EC50) values. Consec-
utive daily treatments lowered the EC50s even in the presence
of as much as 10% serum (Figure S3B).
By light microscopy and transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) (Figure S3C and S3D), mixed features of apoptotic/
necrotic cell death were visible, such as nuclear envelope
enlargement, isolated nuclear bodies, and condensed chro-
matin. As visible in Figure 3C, ReACp53 increased the proportion
of YO-PRO-1 (staining apoptotic cells) and propidium iodide (PI,
staining late apoptotic/necrotic cells) OVCAR3-positive cells in a
concentration-dependent manner, but a scrambled control pep-
tide did not, strengthening the evidence for sequence specificity
of ReACp53. Similar results were obtained in S1 GODL cells (Fig-
ures 3D and S3E, quantified by flow cytometry). We could detect
Bad cleavage after 16 hr of ReACp53 treatment at concentra-
tions of 5 mM and above in S1 GODL cells (Figure 3E), indicative
of apoptosis. However, the pan-caspase inhibitor QV-OPh only
partially rescued cell viability. NEC-1, an inhibitor of necroptosis,
similarly showed a significant but incomplete rescue of cell
viability (Figure 3F).
Another indication of rescued p53 activity is induction of G0/
G1 cell-cycle arrest. To test this, we treated S1 GODL cells for
4/5 hr with ReACp53 or a scrambled peptide and examined
DNA content by flow cytometry. We detected a small but signif-
icant shift in the cell-cycle distribution of the asynchronous
population, with more cells in G0/G1 and fewer in G2/M phase
(Figure 3G). We observed a �40% reduction in phopsho-
Rb(S608/611) consistent with a G0/G1 cell-cycle arrest in prog-
ress (Figures S3F and S3G). Levels of phospho-Chk2 were
unaltered upon ReACp53, suggesting that ReACp53 does not
induce DNA damage (Figure S3H).
Lastly, we checked for p53 levels upon ReACp53 treatment.
p53 cellular levels are tightly controlled to express little protein
in the absence of a stimulus (Levine and Oren, 2009). This is
due, at least in part, to MDM2, an ubiquitin ligase that targets
p53 for proteosomal degradation. Partially unfolded p53 mutants
typically cannot interact with MDM2, resulting in protein accu-
mulation (Joerger and Fersht, 2008). In agreement with this hy-
pothesis, we detected high levels of R248Q p53 in S1 GODL cells
grown as a monolayer (Figure S3I). Upon ReACp53 treatment,
p53 levels gradually decreased. Given that there is less aggre-
gated p53 upon ReACp53 treatment (Figure 2D), we hypothe-
sized that the wild-type (WT)-like folded protein could be
interacting with MDM2. We used a pharmacologic approach to
test this, by applying Nutlin-3, a p53-MDM2 interaction inhibitor,
to S1 GODL cells treated with ReACp53 (Vassilev et al., 2004).
Upon combined ReACp53/Nutlin-3 treatment, p53 levels were
higher, supporting the idea that the now properly folded mutant
p53 can interact with MDM2 (Figures S3J and S3K). Concurrent
treatment with both molecules resulted in a synergistic reduction
of EC50 values upon addition of 10 mM Nutlin-3 in low passaged
S1 GODL cells (Figures S3D–S3F).
ReACp53 Induces Rapid Cell Death in Human Primary
Uterine Fibroblasts Transfected with a Dominant-
Negative R175H p53 Mutant Grown in 3D
To further validate p53 as the primary target of ReACp53 action,
we tested its effects on an isogenic background by infecting hu-
man primary uterine fibroblasts (UtFIB) with a GFP construct or a
GFP/R175H p53-expressing construct (Figure 3H). GFP-positive
fibroblasts were sorted and p53 expression was tested by west-
ern blot and immunofluorescence (Figures 3I–3K). The GFP/
R175H p53-expressing UtFIB rapidly changed morphology and
started proliferating faster than the GFP control (Figure 3I). In
order to study the effects of ReACp53 in a more physiological
model system that better recapitulates drug responses observed
in vivo, we tested UtFIB response to ReACp53 using a 3D
(J) Western blot of lysates from GFP- and GFP/R175H p53-infected UtFIB showing p53 expression. GAPDH stain was performed on the same membrane after
stripping.

representative experiment is shown (n = 3). Biological replicates (symbols, n = 3) are normalized to vehicle and expressed as fold change ± SD. ANOVA with
Tukey’s honest significant difference significance criterion was performed to calculate p values. ***p < 0.0001.

 Matrigel culture system (L’Espe
´ rance et al., 2008). After seeding
the cells in Matrigel and allowing them to grow for 2 days,
GFP and GFP/R175H p53 UtFIB were treated twice with
increasing ReACp53 concentrations (0–10 mM) and cell death
was assessed by Annexin V/PI staining upon release from Matri-
gel (Figure 3L). The response to ReACp53 in UtFIBs carrying the
aggregating R175H p53 mutant was 2- to 10-fold higher than
controls.
ReACp53 Acts to Stabilize Mutant p53 In Vitro
Consistent with mutant p53 overexpression, we detected a sig-
nificant amount of SDS-resistant p53 high molecular weight ag-
gregates in GFP/R175H UtFIB (Figure S3O). We tested the
effects of ReACp53 on p53 stability by adding it to cell lysates
of either normal untransfected UtFIB, GFP/R175H UtFIB, or S1
GODL (R248Q p53) lysates, followed by heating at 42�C for
10 min. This resulted in a high proportion of mutant p53 SDS-
insoluble aggregates, which were significantly reduced by co-in-
cubation with ReACp53 (Figure S3O), indicative of a direct effect
of ReACp53 on p53 stability in vitro.
ReACp53 Specifically Reduces Cell Viability and
Proliferation of Cancer Cells Bearing Mutant but Not
Wild-type p53 When Grown as Organoids
We established model organoids by growing S1 GODL cells for
2 days followed by two consecutive treatments with ReACp53
(Figure 4A). We observed a reduction in cell viability reflected
in the increased YO-PRO-1/PI staining (Figure 4B). Typically,
S1 GODL organoids are 30–200 mm in diameter, with central cav-
ities filled with vesicles and pili (Figures S4A–S4C). Organoids
treated for 2 days with 10 mM ReACp53 lose their morphology,
with several cells being apoptotic/necrotic (Figures 4C and
S4D–S4J). By TEM, we detected enlarged nuclear envelope
and ER, chromatin condensation, and condensed mitochondria
(Figures 4D and S4H–S4J), compatible with late apoptotic/
necrotic cell death. Cell death was confirmed by Annexin V/PI
staining of organoid cells derived from a panel of control cell lines
(MCF7, SKOV3, Detroit562, S1 GODL, Table S4) and clinical
samples from eight patients with different p53 status (Table S3)
treated twice with ReACp53. Results show extensive cell death
in organoids bearing p53 aggregating mutations, but not WT
or null cells (Figures 4E and S4K–S4M). Longer treatments
(1 week) resulted in a higher proportion of HGSOC patient-
derived
organoids
undergoing
extensive
cell
death,
with
apparent EC50 values in the low micromolar range (Figures 4F,
S4N, and S4O). This was accompanied by a marked reduction
in the number of Ki67 proliferating cells (Figure 4G). These results
suggest that, in this clinically relevant model, ReACp53 is effec-
tive on tumor cells bearing aggregation-prone p53 but not on WT
folded protein or cells not expressing p53.
Transcriptional Reactivation of p53 by ReACp53
The change in p53 protein conformation and localization,
increased cell death, and reduction in proliferation are all
compatible with rescued p53 function by ReACp53. To gain
further insights, we performed RNAseq of organoids generated
from OVCAR3 cells and HGSOC patient 1 primary cells as well
as MCF7 and primary cells derived from an ovarian endometrioid
cancer patient (WT p53, patient 8) as controls, all treated for
2 days with 5 mM ReACp53 (Figure 5A). At a cutoff p value
<0.01, over 2,400 transcripts were found to be differentially regu-
lated 1.5-fold or more upon ReACp53 treatment in the OVCAR3
sample, and over 700 for the HGSOC primary sample, with close
to 80% overlap between datasets (Figure 5A). The definite differ-
ences upon ReACp53 treatment in the two mutant p53 speci-
mens resulted in segregation of treated and untreated samples
in an unsupervised clustering. On the other hand, there were
few differences in the control samples, so that treated and un-
treated were randomly clustered (Figure S5A). When examining
the adjusted p value distribution, we found few transcripts with
significant p values in the samples bearing WT p53 (Figure S5B).
This suggests that ReACp53 in the conditions tested does not
have a significant effect on organoids generated from cells
expressing WT p53, neither the cell line (MCF7) nor the primary
endometrioid tumor from patient 8, while eliciting a clear effect
at the transcriptional level for cells carrying the aggregating
R248Q mutation.
Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) revealed that the majority
of differentially regulated transcripts were related to cellular
growth and proliferation, movement, death and survival, and
cellular development for both OVCAR3 and HGSOC patient 1
samples (Figures 5B and S6C). Gene ontology analysis of the
OVCAR3 dataset highlighted that the most represented terms
in the upregulated mRNAs were regulation of transcription and
RNA metabolic processes, regulation of cell proliferation, and
cell death, while the downregulated mRNAs were related to
oxidation reduction, response to organic substance and cell
adhesion, and generation of metabolites and energy (Fig-
ure S5D). Upstream regulator analysis of the OVCAR3 dataset
performed by IPA revealed how p53 was the most significant
upstream transcriptional regulator (Table S5), strengthening the
idea that ReACp53 acts on p53. We selected �80 transcripts,
which are known either as p53 transcriptional targets or as part
of the p53 signaling network, and mapped their expression levels
for vehicle- and ReACp53-treated organoids (Figures 5C and
S5E). Among the upregulated mRNAs are some well-character-
ized p53 targets such as p21, GADD45B, PUMA, THBS1, NOXA,
and DRAM1. Significant fold changes for these were found in the
responsive tumor sample and OVCAR3 cells only (Figure 5D).
Two p53 homologs, p63 and p73, were differentially regulated,
with p63 being upregulated and p73 being downregulated also
at the protein level in both OVCAR and S1 GODL cells (Figures
5D–5F). Besides the p53 network, we identified several meta-
bolic processes that are affected by ReACp53. Among these,
glycolysis and gluconeogenesis, citrate cycle, pyruvate, lipids
and nicotinamide metabolism, and the mevalonate pathway
were downregulated (Figure S5F). The last is of particular interest
given that it has been shown to be upregulated by mutant p53
(Freed-Pastor et al., 2012).
ReACp53 Detection and Pharmacokinetics Profile in
Serum of Treated Animals
Next we checked in vivo stability and resistance to proteolytic
cleavage, which are potential challenges for ReACp53 adminis-
tration. To do so, we determined the in vivo pharmacokinetics
profile of ReACp53. Given that ReACp53 is a peptide, its unam-
biguous detection in complex mixtures such as serum required
the optimization of a sensitive liquid chromatographic/tandem

(Anderson and Hunter, 2006). The assay allowed us to discrimi-
nate ReACp53 with high specificity in both serum and tissues.
ReACp53 administered intraperitoneally quickly entered the
systemic circulation and could be detected in the serum of treated
immunocompromised mice with a peak concentration of 1.2 ±
0.3 mM at the 1-hr time point (Figures S6A–S6C). In addition, we
could detect ReACp53 in tumor tissue (Figure S6D). While the

the high stability of ReACp53 warranted
further in vivo testing.

with a Matrigel/MCF7 (WT p53) suspen-

ACp53 to preferentially target mutated
aggregation-prone p53. Treatment was
started the same day (Figure 6A). In the
treatment protocol, tumors were allowed
to develop for 2 weeks prior to treatment initiation (Figure 6A).
In both models, the treatment phase consisted of 3 weeks of
daily intraperitoneal (IP) injections with 15 mg/kg of ReACp53,
sequence-scrambled control peptide, or vehicle alone. The
intraperitoneal route was chosen as IP administration of
chemotherapeutic drugs in ovarian cancer patients has been
shown to be more efficacious than systemic administration
and has been recommended by the National Cancer Institute
for existing standard treatments (Morgan et al., 2013). For
both models, tumor volumes monitored daily indicated that

 only OVCAR3 xenografts treated with ReACp53 shrank while
both vehicle- and scrambled control-treated tumors more
than doubled in size (Figures 6B and 6C). Mutant p53-bearing
tumors in the ReACp53-treated mice cohorts were 80%–90%
smaller in weight than the control cohort (Figures 6B and 6C),
confirming the ability of ReACp53 to limit tumor proliferation
and shrink tumors in vivo. Analysis of residual tumors from
the treatment model by Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stain
showed a higher ratio of Matrigel to tumor cells for ReACp53-
treated xenografts (Figure 6D). Tumor sections were stained
with PanK (marking tumor epithelia), p53, and Ki67 (Figure 6D).
A significant reduction of Ki67-positive cells was evident in Re-
ACp53-treated OVCAR3 xenografts, indicative of a reduced
proliferative index (Figures 6E, S6I, and S6J). MCF7 xenografts
carrying WT p53 were not responsive (Figure 6C) indicating
that, at least in this experimental design, tumors harboring a
functional WT p53 are unaffected by ReACp53. Similar results
were observed in the minimal residual disease model (Figures
S6G–S6J). In this paradigm, administration of ReACp53 re-
sulted in a significant increase in p21 and MDM2 transcription
in OVCAR3 but not MCF7 xenografts (Figure S6K).
Piknotic nuclei and scarcity of mitotic figures were evident in
the residual grafts, suggestive of extensive cell death and
reduced proliferation (Figure S6E). We confirmed this in an inde-
pendent experiment using pre-established xenografts gener-
ated from patient-derived stabilized cells (S1 GODL) treated
with either vehicle or ReACp53 for 9 days. mRNA levels for a
selection of p53 targets including the pro-apoptotic GADD45b
and PUMA were increased in the ReACp53-treated grafts (Fig-
ure 6F). Immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis revealed a signifi-
cant increase in Bax protein levels (Figure 6G). In addition, we
performed a TUNEL (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase
dUTP nick end labeling) assay and observed a significantly
increased number of dying cells in the ReACp53 implants (Fig-
ure 6H). These results confirm that ReACp53 not only induces
proliferative arrest but also cell death in xenografts bearing
mutant p53 in vivo.

Intraperitoneal Disseminated Disease Model Causes
Cell Death and Reduction of Organ Implants
To confirm the therapeutic relevance of ReACp53, we shifted
toward a more relevant in vivo model by injecting 2.5 3 106
HGSOC patient-derived cells (S1 GODL) intraperitoneally.
Organ tumor implants and ascites developed over a 2-week
period and were confirmed histologically before initiation
of therapy (Figure 7A). Three mice from the vehicle- and
ReACp53-treated cohorts were sacrificed after four daily IP
treatments and ascites were analyzed. Over 80% of cells were
Annexin V and/or PI positive in the ReACp53 group (Figure 7B).

 We also found a significantly increased population in G0/G1
phase (Figure 7C), supporting proliferative arrest upon ReACp53
administration in vivo. After the 3 weeks of daily IP treatments,
mice were sacrificed and ascites and organs were analyzed.
An equal small aliquot of cells derived from the IP cavity by peri-
toneal lavage were plated in quadruplicate. Only the vehicle-
and scrambled-treated cells grew in culture (Figure 7D). The re-
maining tumor cells from the peritoneal lavage were pelleted,
fixed, and embedded for histological analysis. This analysis
confirmed that the ReACp53-treated mice had very few residual
tumor cells in the peritoneal cavity compared with vehicle- or
scrambled-treated controls (Figure 7E). Similarly, organ im-
plants were less frequent and composed of fewer cells in the
ReACp53 mice (Figures 7F and 7G).
ReACp53 Is Well Tolerated In Vivo
We monitored the treated mice for possible side effects arising
from the administration of ReACp53. Complete cell blood counts
and ions, total proteins, and kidney and liver function were as-
sayed. As shown in Table S6, we did not detect any significant
alteration of values upon ReACp53 treatment compared with
vehicle-treated mice. The anatomy of major organs was unal-
tered, with no difference between ReACp53-, vehicle-, or scram-
bled peptide-treated samples (Figure S6M). These results sug-
gest that, at the dose studied, ReACp53 is well tolerated and
does not induce measurable toxicities.
DISCUSSION
Folded, partially unfolded, and aggregated p53 are in equilibrium
(Bullock and Fersht, 2001). p53 aggregation is a highly favored
process in those instances where a structural mutation destabi-
lizes the molecule permitting exposure of the adhesive segment
p53252–258 that is normally buried deep within the protein (Bullock
et al., 1997; Bullock and Fersht, 2001; Xu et al., 2011). Previous
efforts to rescue p53 function have focused on stabilizing the
native fold by chemical modifications or ligand binding, shifting
the equilibrium toward the active conformation. This approach
has been successful in vitro (Bykov et al., 2002; Issaeva et al.,
2003; Liu et al., 2013; Wilcken et al., 2012; Yu et al., 2012) with
one molecule advancing to the clinical phase (APR-246; Leh-
mann et al., 2012; Khoo et al., 2014). The purpose of ReACp53
is also to rescue p53 function, but it acts at a different step of
the dynamic equilibrium: p53 aggregation. Once exposed, the
adhesive segment 252–258 binds to identical segments in other
destabilized p53 molecules. ReACp53 is designed to mask this
segment in the aggregates, preventing further aggregation and
shifting the folding equilibrium toward its functional, WT-like
state (Figure 8). Consistent with this mode of action, when
HGSOC patient-derived primary cells are treated with ReACp53,
neither unfolded nor aggregated p53 are observed. Rather, the
aggregation-prone mutant p53 seen in untreated cells in punc-
tate form in the clinical samples examined is dispersed and relo-
calized to the nucleus.
When culturing tumor cells as organoids in a physiologically
relevant 3D system, we observe that ReACp53-rescued p53 be-
haves similarly to the WT counterpart by inducing cell death and
cell-cycle arrest. In the tumor organoids, these effects were
observed only in those specimens bearing mutant but not WT
p53 protein. In further support of the conversion of p53 in treated
cells from aggregated to functional states, we observed by RNA-
seq that several p53 target genes in organoids generated from
OVCAR3 cells bearing R248Q p53 are differentially regulated,
including upregulation of canonical p53 targets such as PUMA,
NOXA, p21, GADD45B, and 14-3-3s.
Our data on this particular set of samples are consistent with
the observation that restoring the oncosuppressive function of
WT p53 leads to tumor regression (Ventura et al., 2007). On the
other hand, mutant p53 is a bona fide oncogene. It has been
shown that some tumor cells expressing gain-of-function mu-
tants of p53 are addicted to its expression (Muller and Vousden,
2013). As such, given that p53 levels decrease upon ReACp53
treatment, some of the effects observed might be linked to
removal of a crucial oncogene. This could potentially be mutation
and/or context dependent (Vaughan et al., 2012). In cells where
this process is dominant, one could expect Nutlin to antagonize
the effects of ReACp53.
Figure 8. Model for the Mechanism of Action of ReACp53
Unstable p53 mutants partially unfold, exposing the aggregation-prone
segment LTIITLE. This segment interacts with the same segment from other
p53 molecules, driving p53 into its inactive aggregated state (top). ReACp53
(cyan) treatment blocks the aggregation pathway, shifting the equilibrium
toward functional, soluble p53 (bottom). Functional p53 enters the nucleus and
induces cell death and proliferation arrest. Folded p53 interacts with MDM2
and is degraded.

 Consistent with the loss of the gain-of-function phenotypes
exhibited by mutant p53 is the observation that genes known
to be upregulated by mutant p53 were downregulated upon
ReACp53 exposure. As an example, we found that most genes
in the mevalonate pathway were downregulated. This pathway
contributes to cell migration and invasion in ovarian cancer (Ha-
shimoto et al., 2005) and is activated through interaction of
mutant p53 with SREBP transcription factors (Freed-Pastor
et al., 2012). Blocking the mevalonate pathway in HGSOC has
been shown to be beneficial, given that compounds such as
alendronate, lovastatin, fluvastatin, and zoledronic acid reduce
the tumor burden and presence of ascites in vivo, and tumor in-
vasion in vitro and in vivo (Hashimoto et al., 2005; Knight et al.,
2009; Martirosyan et al., 2010).
Besides the mevalonate pathway, several other metabolic
processes are impacted by p53 through various mechanisms
(Kruiswijk et al., 2015). ReACp53 treatment resulted in lower
mRNA levels for enzymes involved in the tricarboxylic acid cycle,
oxidative phosphorylation, pyruvate and nicotinamide meta-
bolism, glycolysis, and gluconeogenesis. This reduction in
glycolytic metabolism may result in lower glucose uptake, sug-
gesting the possibility of using fluorodeoxyglucose-positron
emission tomography (FDG-PET) to detect early response to
ReACp53 in vivo.
While several of the effects of ReACp53 at the transcriptional
level are in anticipated directions, some variations were unex-
pected. One might expect p73 mRNA levels to increase upon
p53 activation (Vossio et al., 2002), but our RNAseq data showed
a reduction, also reflected at the protein level. Relevant to this
finding, p73 is increased at both mRNA and protein levels in
over 70% of ovarian cancers (Rufini et al., 2011), and its overex-
pression has been associated with high-grade malignancies
(Chen et al., 2000). It was reported that p53 inactivation
might cause p73 upregulation through E2F (Tophkhane et al.,
2012), although other mechanisms such as direct p73 seques-
tration through co-aggregation are possible (Xu et al., 2011).
Nevertheless, p53 reactivation by ReACp53 in our system is
accompanied by a reduction in p73 levels, a potential beneficial
effect in ovarian cancer. In summary, directionality of some of the
changes we observed by RNAseq may be relevant and beneficial
to the specific disease setting.
Arresting p53 aberrant self-aggregation could also block its
co-aggregation with other proteins, which, upon ReACp53
administration, can resume their functions and contribute to
the effects seen. In particular, p63 and p73 have been shown
to co-aggregate with mutant p53 (Xu et al., 2011). Alternatively,
p63 and p73 might be direct ReACp53 targets as they both
have segments with high similarity to the p53 aggregation-prone
sequence (Xu et al., 2011). Whether these or other proteins are
targeted by ReACp53 remains to be evaluated.
To characterize ReACp53 effects in vivo, we tested it on two
xenograft models obtaining an 80%–90% reduction in tumor
burden depending on the paradigm. For these experiments,
ReACp53 was administered via IP, a standard route of adminis-
tration of drugs for the HGSOC patient population. Of note, we
observed therapeutic efficacy at distant tumor sites in vivo.
This is consistent with the favorable stability of ReACp53 in
serum, as judged by its pharmacokinetics profile. In addition, ef-
ficacy was proven in a physiological disseminated disease
model that faithfully recapitulates the HGSOC characteristics
observed in patients, including the presence of ascites and im-
plants in distant organs including liver, omentum, and spleen
(Naora and Montell, 2005). Standard blood tests and detailed
necropsies revealed no tissue damage or blood alterations, sup-
porting the non-toxic behavior of this peptide.
The usefulness of ReACp53 in cancer treatment may be in
co-administration with carboplatin. The current standard of
care for HGSOC patients entails platinum-based chemotherapy,
with superior effects when administered intraperitoneally (Mor-
gan et al., 2013). Carboplatin generates DNA damage, which in
turns activates the p53 pathway driving cell death, provided
that p53 is functional (Siddik, 2003). Given that p53 is frequently
mutated and not functional in HGSOC, combining an agent that
restores p53 functionality such as ReACp53 with carboplatin
therapy may be a valuable therapeutic option that warrants
further exploration.
ReACp53 may be effective in treating various cancer types. In
principle, it could be useful in all tumors where p53 inactivation
arises through partial unfolding and aggregation. With thousands
of different p53 mutations described (IARC TP53 database,
http://p53.iarc.fr) (Petitjean et al., 2007), we cannot yet anticipate
which will respond to ReACp53, other than the well-established
aggregation-prone mutations. We showed here that we can
target two of the three most common p53 hotspot mutations in
HGSOC (R175 and R248), which account for >15% of all cases
of ovarian cancer (IARC TP53 database, http://p53.iarc.fr) (Petit-
jean et al., 2007). An additional feature is that ReACp53 should
have no effect on cells with folded WT p53. We did not observe
significant effects of ReACp53 on WT p53-carrying cells in the
organoid 3D assays or in vivo. However, ReACp53 may also
affect tumors bearing WT p53 if the protein is partially unfolded
and aggregated. WT p53 has been reported in a mutant-like,
aggregated conformation in basal cell carcinoma and hypoxic
tumors (Lasagna-Reeves et al., 2013; Rieber and Strasberg-
Rieber, 2012) and therefore could potentially be targeted by
ReACp53 in specific cases.
In conclusion, the work presented here supports treating sus-
ceptible cancers as protein aggregation diseases as an alterna-
tive approach to cancer therapy.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Cell Lines and Clinical Samples
This study was approved by the UCLA Office for the Protection of Research
Subjects (IRB 10-000727). High-grade serous cancers, obtained from con-
senting patients, were dissociated to single cells by enzymatic digestion.
The S1 GODL cell line was established from primary cells derived from patient
1’s tumor. The detailed procedure for the derivation and characterization of S1
GODL will be described elsewhere (Janzen et al., 2015). Cell lines were ob-
tained from ATCC, maintained in an 8% CO2 incubator at 37�C and used within
15 passages. All the cells used in this study were propagated in the ATCC-
recommended serum supplemented medium and treated in serum-free
medium (PrEGM, Lonza).
In Vitro 3D Organoid Assay
Single-cell suspensions (20,000 cells/well) were plated around the rim of a 24-
well cell culture dish in a 1:1.3 mixture of PrEGM medium (Lonza CC-3166) and
Matrigel (BD Biosciences), and overlaid with 500 ml of PrEGM. Two days after
plating, treatment with ReACp53, scramble peptide, or vehicle (DMSO) was
initiated. A complete medium change was performed daily. Following

 treatment (day 2 or day 7, depending on the experiment), HGSOC organoids
were released from Matrigel by incubation in 1 mg/ml dispase (Invitrogen). Or-
ganoids were incubated in warm 0.05% Trypsin-EDTA, then passed through a
20-gauge syringe to yield single cells. Cell viability was determined by manual
cell count. Apoptosis and proliferation were determined by flow cytometry (BD
LSR II flow cytometer) of cells after staining. For each sample, 0.5 ml of
AnnexinV-FITC and 2 ml of 50 mg/ml PI (BD Biosciences) diluted in 13 Annexin
binding buffer were added to cells according to the manufacturer’s instruc-
tions. Ki67 (Vector Laboratories) was used at 0.5 ml/sample on fixed cells in
PBS. For reporting, results were normalized to vehicle-treated controls.
Animal Experiments
All animal experiments were approved by the UCLA Animal Research Commit-
tee and performed under oversight of the Division of Laboratory Animal
Medicine (DLAM). Immunocompromised NSG mice (Jackson Laboratories:
NOD.Cg-PrkdcscidIl2rgtm1Wjl/SzJ) were housed on a 12-hr light/dark schedule.
