Abstract
A summary of the latest evidence-based nutrition guidelines for the prevention and management of diabetes is presented.
These guidelines are based on existing recommendations last published in 2011, and were formulated by an expert panel
of specialist dietitians after a literature review of recent evidence. Recommendations have been made in terms of foods
rather than nutrients wherever possible. Guidelines for education and care delivery, prevention of Type 2 diabetes,
glycaemic control for Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease risk management, management of diabetes-
related complications, other considerations including comorbidities, nutrition support, pregnancy and lactation, eating
disorders, micronutrients, food supplements, functional foods, commercial diabetic foods and nutritive and non-nutritive
sweeteners are included. The sections on pregnancy and prevention of Type 2 diabetes have been enlarged and the weight
management section modified to include considerations of remission of Type 2 diabetes. A section evaluating detailed
considerations in ethnic minorities has been included as a new topic. The guidelines were graded using adapted ‘GRADE’
methodology and, where strong evidence was lacking, grading was not allocated. These 2018 guidelines emphasize a
flexible, individualized approach to diabetes management and weight loss and highlight the emerging evidence for
remission of Type 2 diabetes. The full guideline document is available at www.diabetes.org.uk/nutrition-guidelines.

Introduction
‘An appropriate diet represents the cornerstone for diabetes
therapy, and there is now unequivocal evidence that Type 2
diabetes can be delayed or prevented by a well-structured
diet and increased physical activity, generally resulting in
weight loss’ [1]. Most experts now agree that diet has an
increasingly important part to play in both the management
and prevention of diabetes, with emerging evidence sug-
gesting potential remission of Type 2 diabetes. There
remains little consensus, however, about the constituents
of an ideal or optimal diet, and current evidence suggests
that various dietary patterns can be effective [2]. Diabetes
UK reflected these conclusions in their evidence-based
nutrition guidelines for diabetes, last published in 2011
[3] and, as the evidence remains fully supportive of these
findings, those guidelines were used as the basis for these
new recommendations.
One criticism that is frequently levelled at new recom-
mendations is that they may contradict previous guidance,
and this leads to a level of distrust. It is worth remem-
bering that nutrition is a relatively young and complex
science, with a large amount of emerging evidence, and
these
new
recommendations
attempt
to
establish
the
current evidence base for guidance and, in so doing, may
well contradict traditional beliefs and usual practice. Key
features of the new guidelines were to try to move from
recommendations for individual nutrients to foods that
meet the needs of people with diabetes, and to make the
new guidelines more accessible and usable by the individ-
uals and groups for whom they are designed. Formulating
evidence-based recommendations from the available liter-
ature can be challenging for a variety of reasons, including
quality, type of intervention, analysis and application of
dietary studies.

 Quality of studies
Many different strategies are used to assess the effects of
different diets and foods on health outcomes, including
randomized controlled trials (RCTs), intervention studies
with no comparator group, prospective cohort studies, cross-
sectional cohort studies and case reports. RCTs are widely
regarded as the ‘gold standard’, but are often impractical or
limited when assessing nutritional outcomes which are
influenced by many factors that are difficult to control, and
where outcomes of interest take place far in the future with
the impossibility of following up individuals for many
decades. For this reason, well-conducted, large, prospective
cohort studies supply useful data for evaluating the relation-
ship between dietary patterns and individual foods and
diabetes-related outcomes, and are widely used to inform
these new guidelines.
Type of intervention: foods or nutrients
Traditionally, intervention studies in people with diabetes
have focused on specific nutrients, for example, carbohydrate
and fat, but there is a global movement towards more food-
based guidelines [4]. Recommendations from dietary studies
can be formulated in terms of dietary patterns, foods or
specific nutrients, and the 2018 recommendations highlight
the importance of foods rather than nutrients wherever
possible.
Analysis
Dietary intervention studies frequently report contradictory
results and this has been highlighted recently with meta-
analyses reporting conflicting outcomes regarding the role of
saturated fat in cardiovascular disease (CVD) and the effect
of low carbohydrate diets on glycaemic control when
compared with other dietary strategies. This is compounded
by the binary nature of such intervention studies, which
typically assess the efficacy of two very different diets,
whereas populations eat more varied diets. The applicability
of meta-analyses, which are intended for the aggregation of
similar studies [5], is questionable for dietary studies where
there is considerable heterogeneity resulting from differences
in type, duration and intensity of the intervention, differ-
ences in comparator diets and variation in the participants
including duration of diabetes and medication use.
Application
Applying and evaluating intervention diets used in dietary
studies is challenging. There are few readily available bio-
markers to assess adherence, and often the only measure used
is self-reported dietary intake. This measure is notoriously
unreliable and it has long been known that under-reporting,
especially in those who are obese, is common [6]. As a result,
it is challenging to establish a causal relationship between
the individual components of study diets and their reported
effects, and to formulate specific guidelines for free-living pop-
ulations.
The above limitations were all considered when formulat-
ing the new recommendations, and the following article
summarizes the Diabetes UK 2018 evidence-based nutrition
guidelines for the prevention and management of diabetes in
adults. The full document is available at: www.diabetes.org.
uk/nutrition-guidelines.
Methods
In 2016, Diabetes UK appointed an expert Nutrition Sub-
Committee to review and update the existing 2011 nutrition
guidelines [3]. These previous guidelines had included studies
published up to August 2010, and the current guidelines
incorporated this existing evidence together with additional
studies published between January 2010 and December
2016. In addition, key publications of meta-analyses and
systematic reviews up to July 2017 were included, and an
exception was made to include a major study of diabetes
remission published in December 2017 [7].
The committee made the decision to retain previous
sections including education and care delivery, prevention
of Type 2 diabetes, glycaemic control for Type 1 and Type 2
diabetes, CVD risk management, management of diabetes-
related complications, other considerations such as comor-
bidities, nutrition support, pregnancy and lactation, eating
disorders,
micronutrients,
food
supplements,
functional
foods, commercial diabetic foods and nutritive and non-
nutritive sweeteners. The sections on pregnancy and preven-
tion of Type 2 diabetes were enlarged and the weight
management section was modified to include remission of
Type 2 diabetes in response to current interest in emerging
data. A section evaluating detailed considerations in ethnic
minorities was included as a new topic.
Relevant studies were identified by electronic searches in
EMBASE, MEDLINE and the Cochrane Central Register of
Controlled Trials. Reference lists of selected papers were
What’s new?

 then investigated for any further studies suitable for consid-
eration. Existing guidelines were identified from local,
national and international reports. Search terms and key-
words for each section were defined and agreed by the
committee. Inclusion criteria for studies were adults (aged
>18 years) with Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes. RCTs, interven-
tion studies and prospective cohort studies, all with a dietary
or lifestyle component, were included.
Formal meta-analyses of dietary interventions for diabetes
were not undertaken because it was not deemed a valid
approach. The majority of studies were at high risk of bias
and heterogeneous in terms of study design, type and
intensity of the intervention, the comparator diet or interven-
tion, study length, duration of diabetes and medication use.
The GRADE system (Grades of Recommendation Assess-
ment, Development and Evaluation), a systematic approach
to making judgements about the quality of evidence and
strength of recommendations, was used as the basis for
grading these dietary recommendations [8]. GRADE was
employed in these guidelines as it is a system widely used for
nutritional recommendations and has been adopted globally
by ~100 organizations that are responsible for formulating
recommendations to support healthcare decision-making
[9]. GRADE also encourages a focus on the recommenda-
tions that are of primary importance for people with diabetes,
and which are worded in manner that are more person-
focused and emphasize eating behaviour and diabetes. It is
acknowledged that much of the evidence from nutrition
research is derived from prospective cohort studies rather than
RCTs, and applying GRADE downgrades evidence from
prospective studies when compared with RCTs; this should be
borne in mind when considering the grading allocated to each
recommendation.
The final guidelines underwent internal review by all
members of the committee, and were then submitted to
external peer review by three experts in the field. They were
subsequently reviewed by Diabetes UK’s Council of People
with Diabetes, Diabetes UK’s Council of Healthcare Profes-
sionals, British Dietetic Association’s Diabetes Specialist
Group, Association of British Clinical Diabetologists, Pri-
mary Care Diabetes Society, and Royal College of GPs.
Summary of guidelines with evidence
‘GRADE’
An overview of the guidelines is provided below. The
evidence GRADE is marked by a number from 1 to 4, where
a higher number denotes stronger evidence and lower
numbers indicate deductions made for lower-quality studies
with limited generalizabilty, see below:
� Grade 4: strong recommendation based on high-quality
evidence.
� Grade 3: moderate recommendation based on moderate-
quality evidence.
� Grade 2: low-strength recommendation based on low-
quality evidence.
� Grade 1 (or less): very-low-strength recommendation
based on very-low-quality evidence.
Not Rated: A key aspect of current approaches to
supporting people with diabetes is to encourage practice
that is individualized. It is challenging to rate such recom-
mendations using the GRADE system, particularly in situa-
tions where multiple conditions influence health and dietary
approaches. In response to this, a deliberate decision was
made to report these recommendations as ‘Not Rated’,
indicated by the letters NR.
The references to the evidence linked to the following
recommendations can be found in the full document avail-
able at: www.diabetes.org.uk/nutrition-guidelines.

general populations include:
� Mediterranean diet;
4
� DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hyper-
tension) diet;
2
� vegetarian and vegan diets;
2
� the Nordic healthy diet;
2
� moderate carbohydrate restriction.

risk in general populations including red and
processed meat, potatoes, particularly French
fries, sugar-sweetened beverages and refined
carbohydrates
2
� Offer culturally tailored, multi-component life-
style interventions to reduce the risk of Type 2
diabetes in ethnic minority groups
3
Weight management and remission of Type 2 diabetes
� For overweight or obese people with Type 2
diabetes:
� for Type 2 diabetes remission, aim for
weight loss of at least 15 kg, as soon as
possible after diagnosis;
3
� to improve glycaemic control and CVD
risk. aim for at least 5% weight loss
achieved by reducing calorie (energy)
intake and increasing energy expenditure.
4
� Adopt an individualized approach which may
include dietary, physical activity, surgical and
medical strategies that are recommended for
people without diabetes
NR
Glycaemic control and Type 1 diabetes
� Offer education to support people with Type 1
diabetes to identify and quantify their dietary
carbohydrate intake for glycaemic control.
Specifically:
� adjust insulin to carbohydrate intake in
people using multiple daily injections or
continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion
(insulin pump);
4
� aim for consistent quantities of carbohy-
drates on a day-to-day basis in people on
fixed-insulin regimens.
1
Glycaemic control and Type 2 diabetes
� Prioritize sustained weight loss of at least 5%
in overweight people by reducing calorie
(energy) intake and increasing energy expen-
diture
4
� Aim for a Mediterranean-style diet or equiv-
alent healthy eating pattern. (See CVD section)
4
� Offer individualized education to support
people to identify and quantify their dietary
carbohydrate intake, encourage low glycaemic
index foods and consider reducing the total
amount of carbohydrates
NR
� Aim for at least 150 min per week of moderate
to vigorous physical activity, over at least 3
days
4
Cardiovascular disease risk reduction: blood lipids and blood
pressure
� Dietary patterns, specifically the Mediterranean
and DASH-style diets, are recommended to
reduce CVD risk factors and CVD events in
people with diabetes. Key features of these diets
include:
� decrease salt intake (<6 g/day);
� eat two portions of oily fish each week;
� eat more wholegrains, fruit and vegetables,
fish, nuts and legumes (pulses);
� consume less red and processed meat, refined
carbohydrates and sugar-sweetened bever-
ages;

 � limit alcohol intake to ≤14 units/week.
� Aim for modest weight loss of at least 5% in
overweight individuals
3
� Aim for at least 150 min per week of moderate
to vigorous physical activity, over at least 3 days
4
� Products containing 2–3g of plant stanols and
sterols per day can be recommended

Considerations in ethnic minority groups
Evidence reviewed in this section informed the recommen-
dations for ethnic considerations in other sections such as
prevention of Type 2 diabetes, and models of education and
care delivery (see above sections).
Nutritional management of diabetes complications
Hypoglycaemia
� An individualized approach to hypoglycaemia
management with appropriate monitoring is
recommended. One example of a strategy com-
monly recommended includes the following:
� take 15–20 g glucose;
� repeat treatment if blood glucose level has
not risen above 4 mmol/l after 15 min;
� depending on individual needs and treat-
ment, a follow-up snack providing 15–20g
carbohydrate may be necessary.
NR
Diabetic nephropathy
� Offer individualized approach to minimize risk
of malnutrition
� Provide advice on potassium, phosphate,
salt and energy intake as clinically required
� Do not routinely restrict protein intake
NR
Lower limb ulcers and amputation
� Assess nutritional status and offer individual-
ized approach to minimize malnutrition, and
optimize glycaemic control
NR
Diabetic gastroparesis
� Offer individualized care to meet nutritional
requirements, manage symptoms and optimize
glycaemic control
NR
Recommendations for dietary management of people with
diabetes and existing CVD are similar to those for people
with diabetes without established CVD (see CVD risk
reduction section above) so these were not repeated. There
was a lack of published evidence to make evidence-based
recommendations for the specific role of diet in the manage-
ment of other diabetes complications including retinopathy
and diabetic ketoacidosis.
Other special considerations
Nutrition support
� Aim to meet nutritional requirements and
adequacy
� Adjust diabetes treatment to optimize gly-
caemic control
� Deliver support from a multi-disciplinary
team
2
� General enhanced recovery after surgery pro-
tocols can be recommended, depending on
individual clinical situation
NR
� Diabetes-specific formulae enteral feeds can be
recommended, but are not routinely used in
the UK
2
Older people
� Offer education, including dietary interven-
tion, to older people with diabetes. Age should
not restrict access to education
4
� Assess nutritional status and care plans under
the supervision of a dietitian
NR
� Adapt general guidelines for people with
diabetes for those with dementia
NR
Diabetes care in institutions
� Offer access to education, including dietary
intervention, to people in institutions

 recommendations should form the basis for dietary manage-
ment of adults with diabetes and those at risk of Type 2
diabetes in the UK. They should be adapted to suit an
individual’s culture, preferences, needs and personal goals.
