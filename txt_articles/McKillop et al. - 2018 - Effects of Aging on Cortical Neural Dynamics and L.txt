the question remains whether aging is associated with reduced sleep need or a diminished capacity to generate sufficient sleep. Here we
tested the hypothesis that aging may affect local cortical networks, disrupting the capacity to generate and sustain sleep oscillations, and
with it the local homeostatic response to sleep loss. We performed chronic recordings of cortical neural activity and local field potentials
from the motor cortex in young and older male C57BL/6J mice, during spontaneous waking and sleep, as well as during sleep after sleep
deprivation. In older animals, we observed an increase in the incidence of non-rapid eye movement sleep local field potential slow waves
and their associated neuronal silent (OFF) periods, whereas the overall pattern of state-dependent cortical neuronal firing was generally
similar between ages. Furthermore, we observed that the response to sleep deprivation at the level of local cortical network activity was

may exist to maintain neuronal function stable across the life span, counteracting global changes in sleep amount and architecture.

Introduction
Aging is a strictly regulated biological process that is thought to
provide selective advantages over attaining immortality and there-
fore increases the evolutionary success of a species. Aging refers to
a variety of modifications that occur progressively as a function of
preceding time spent alive, and can be observed at the molecular,
cellular, and system levels, including in behavior and cognitive
function (Burke and Barnes, 2006; Bishop et al., 2010; Kirkwood,
2010; Zoncu et al., 2010; Kourtis and Tavernarakis, 2011; Morri-
son and Baxter, 2012; Yeoman et al., 2012). Some of these pro-
cesses are entirely physiological and reflect programmed aging,

Significance Statement
The biological significance of age-dependent changes in sleep is unknown but may reflect either a diminished sleep need or a
reduced capacity to generate deep sleep stages. As aging has been linked to profound disruptions in cortical sleep oscillations and
because sleep need is reflected in specific patterns of cortical activity, we performed chronic electrophysiological recordings of
cortical neural activity during waking, sleep, and after sleep deprivation from young and older mice. We found that all main

suggesting that the well-described age-related changes in global sleep are unlikely to arise from a disruption of local network
dynamics within the neocortex.

 whereas others may reflect unwanted, normally inevitable but
possibly preventable, consequences of various stressors encoun-
tered throughout life (Meyer et al., 1999; Enzinger et al., 2005).
Despite notable species differences, numerous studies in both
humans and laboratory animals suggest that waking and sleep
show systematic changes with aging; however, the biological sig-
nificance of these changes is not well understood (Shiromani et
al., 2000; Ohayon et al., 2004; Klerman and Dijk, 2008; Altena et
al., 2010; Bano et al., 2011; Hasan et al., 2012; Klerman et al.,
2013; Banks et al., 2015; Gu et al., 2015; Panagiotou et al., 2017).
One possibility is that age-dependent changes in sleep are a
reflection of anatomical or physiological changes, such as a loss of
synaptic connectivity (Morrison and Baxter, 2012), altered Ca 2�
homeostasis (Toescu and Vreugdenhil, 2010), a decline in the
function of specific brain circuits (Porkka-Heiskanen et al., 2004;
Wigren et al., 2009; Altena et al., 2010; Wang et al., 2011), in-
creased susceptibility to cellular stress (Naidoo et al., 2008; Nai-
doo, 2009; Altena et al., 2010; Kourtis and Tavernarakis, 2011), or
a progressive loss of circadian rhythmicity, such as a decline in the
rhythmic output of the central circadian clock, the suprachias-
matic nucleus (Satinoff et al., 1993; Watanabe et al., 1995; Aujard
et al., 2001; Biello, 2009; Colwell, 2011). It is also possible that the
sleep changes that occur with aging may represent compensatory
responses, in which sleep plays an active and increasingly impor-
tant role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and optimal waking
functions as the organism gets older. Consistent with this, sleep is
known to play a crucial role in various restorative functions,
including molecule biosynthesis, membrane repair, synaptic
remodeling, and other cellular maintenance processes (Mackie-
wicz et al., 2008; Vyazovskiy and Harris, 2013; Xie et al., 2013;
Tononi and Cirelli, 2014; Krueger et al., 2016).
While numerous studies have provided important insights
into the global age-dependent alterations in sleep–wake architec-
ture and electroencephalogram (EEG) across 24 h in mice (Vya-
zovskiy et al., 2006b; Hasan et al., 2012; Banks et al., 2015;
Panagiotou et al., 2017), surprisingly little is known about the
effects of aging on cortical neural activity. This is an important
omission, as numerous studies suggest that the events occurring
at a single neuron and local neuronal population level in the
neocortex have important contributions to global sleep regula-
tion (Vyazovskiy et al., 2009b, 2011; Grosmark et al., 2012; Fisher
et al., 2016; Krueger et al., 2016; Rodriguez et al., 2016; Watson et
al., 2016; Siclari and Tononi, 2017). It is well established that
sleep–wake history is reflected in the level of EEG slow-wave
activity (SWA, 0.5–4 Hz), which increases as a function of pre-
ceding wake duration and decreases during subsequent sleep, and
is therefore used as a measure of sleep homeostasis (Borbe
´ly,
1982; Tobler and Borbe
´ly, 1986; Franken et al., 2001). Slow waves
recorded with cortical EEG or local field potential (LFP) elec-
trodes reflect the synchronous occurrence of population neuro-
nal silence, corresponding to neuronal hyperpolarization or
down-states within thalamocortical networks (Destexhe et al.,
1999; Timofeev, 2013; Vyazovskiy and Harris, 2013; Crunelli et
al., 2015; Neske, 2016). These so-called OFF periods become in-
creasingly more frequent the longer the duration of wakefulness,
and are most prominent during the initial deep non-rapid eye
movement (NREM) sleep occurring immediately after periods of
wakefulness. Despite being a defining feature of NREM sleep,
locally occurring OFF periods may also be detected during wake-
fulness, especially after sleep deprivation (SD) (Vyazovskiy et al.,
2009b, 2011), supporting the notion that sleep may be initiated at
the level of local cortical networks (Krueger et al., 2016). While
the local dynamics of slow waves and cortical neural activity dur-
ing spontaneous sleep and after SD have been thoroughly char-
acterized in young and adult animals, this has not previously been
investigated in the context of aging.
Existingevidencesuggeststhatagingmayleadtospecificchanges

matter with aging has been noted in humans (Coffey et al., 1992; Ge
et al., 2002; Marner et al., 2003; Enzinger et al., 2005; Ziegler et al.,
2012), and a consistent loss of hippocampal synaptic connections
has been identified in rodents (Burke and Barnes, 2006, 2010;
Morrison and Baxter, 2012). Both animal and human studies
have shown aging to be associated with alterations in synaptic
transmission and structural synaptic changes (Peters et al., 2008;
Dumitriu et al., 2010; Morrison and Baxter, 2012; Petralia et al.,
2014). Importantly, older animals have been shown to have larger
synaptic field potentials in the hippocampus, suggesting that the
reduction in synaptic contacts was partially compensated for by
an increase in the electrical responsiveness of the remaining neu-
rons (Barnes and McNaughton, 1980). In addition to these struc-
tural changes, previous studies have shown that aging leads to
dramatic changes in global sleep characteristics, with sleep be-
coming more superficial or fragmented (Vyazovskiy et al., 2006b;
Hasan et al., 2012; Wimmer et al., 2013; Banks et al., 2015). Al-
though there is abundant evidence showing both structural and
functional neuronal modifications with aging, it remains unknown
whether the changes at the level of local cortical circuits are causally
related to age-dependent changes in global sleep architecture.
This omission is particularly relevant, as it remains to be es-
tablished whether aging is associated with a reduced homeostatic
sleep need or instead diminishes the capacity to generate and sustain
deepNREMsleepandtheassociatednetworkoscillations(Klerman
and Dijk, 2008; Cirelli, 2012; Mander et al., 2017). Because both
sleep need and sleep depth are mechanistically and functionally
related to the expression of SWA within local cortical networks
(Massimini et al., 2004; Nir et al., 2011; Vyazovskiy and Harris,
2013; Neske, 2016), we set out to address the above question by
chronically recording neural activity and LFPs in mice �5, 12,
and 24 months of age. We hypothesized that, if age-related
changes in sleep arise, at least in part, from a disruption of net-
work activity within the neocortex, it should manifest in specific
changes within local cortical circuits, such as reduced spiking
activity, local slow waves and the underlying OFF periods, or
altered neural dynamics at state transitions. Furthermore, we
posited that, if aging primarily targets the capacity to produce an
adequate homeostatic response to sleep loss at the level of local
neuronal populations, this should reduce the occurrence of local
cortical slow waves and OFF periods after SD. Surprisingly, we
observed that aging had little effect on neural activity within local
cortical networks, and that the local homeostatic response to SD,
as measured by the occurrence of slow waves and OFF periods,
was robust in older animals. Our findings suggest that the local cor-
tical network mechanisms underlying sleep oscillations and sleep
need are intact in older mice, and that the mechanisms underlying
theprofoundglobalchangesinsleepobservedwithagingaredistinct
from those responsible for local sleep regulation.
Materials and Methods
Experimental animals. Recordings were performed in male C57BL/6J
mice subdivided into three age groups: early adulthood (EA, 4.6 � 0.3
months, n � 10), late adulthood (LA, 12.1 � 0.2 months, n � 11), and
older age (OA, 24.6 � 0.4 months, n � 10). Although the exact corre-
spondence between age in mice and humans remains a topic of debate,
we estimate that the age of the older group in our study corresponded to
�70 years in humans (Dutta and Sengupta, 2016). The number of ani-

 mals used in this study was based on previous studies that investigated
the effects of aging and sleep–wake history on sleep characteristics, in-
cluding its amount, fragmentation, and EEG dynamics (Welsh et al.,
1986; Colas et al., 2005; Hasan et al., 2012; Wimmer et al., 2013; Panag-
iotou et al., 2017). Mice were group housed until they underwent surgery.
The implantation of microwire arrays can cause an immune response,
which can deteriorate the electrophysiological signal and also destabilize
the implant; we therefore opted not to perform longitudinal recordings.
For this reason, mice were implanted shortly before they were required
for surgery. On average, there were 29.4 � 5.6, 22.8 � 1.2, and 31.5 �
3.7 d between the surgery date and baseline recording date, for EA, LA,
and OA mice, respectively (Welch F test: F(2,14.2) � 3.75, p � 0.049). At
�2 weeks after surgery, mice were transferred to custom-made clear
Plexiglas cages (20.3 � 32 � 35 cm), where they were individually housed
with free access to a running wheel (RW; Campden Instruments, wheel
diameter 14 cm, bars spaced 1.11 cm apart inclusive of bars) throughout
the experiment and food available ad libitum. Cages were housed in
ventilated, sound-attenuated Faraday chambers (Campden Instruments,
two cages per chamber) under a standard 12:12 h light-dark cycle (lights
on 0900, ZT0, light levels 120–180 lux). Room temperature and relative
humidity were maintained at 22 � 1°C and 50 � 20%, respectively. All
procedures conformed to the Animal (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986
and were performed under a UK Home Office Project License in accor-
dance with institutional guidelines.
Surgical procedures and electrode configuration. Surgical procedures
were performed as previously described (Cui et al., 2014; Fisher et al.,
2016), a summary of which is provided below. Surgical procedures were
performed under aseptic conditions using isoflurane anesthesia (3%–5%
induction, 1%–2% maintenance). One day before surgery, animals
received dexamethasone (0.2 mg/kg, p.o.). Metacam (1–2 mg/kg, s.c.),
dexamethasone (0.2 mg/kg, s.c.), and vetergesic (0.08 mg/kg, s.c.) were
administered preoperatively. Before implantation, EEG screw electrodes
were soldered to custom-made head-mount connectors (Pinnacle
Technology) and unilaterally implanted into frontal (motor area: antero-
posterior 2 mm, mediolateral 2 mm) and occipital (visual area, V1: an-
teroposterior 3.5–4 mm, mediolateral 2.5 mm) cortical areas. Reference
and ground screw electrodes were implanted above the cerebellum and
contralaterally to the occipital screw, respectively. Two single-stranded,
stainless-steel wires were inserted on either side of the nuchal muscle to
record electromyography. All screws and wires were secured to the skull
using dental acrylic. Mice were also implanted with a polymide-insulated
tungsten microwire array (Tucker-Davis Technologies) implanted into
deep layers of the primary motor cortex. Because this is the first study
that aimed to characterize the effects of aging on the cortical neural
activity and local sleep homeostasis in mice, it was important to target an
area that has been well studied in younger animals; therefore, we opted to
perform LFP and multiunit activity (MUA) recordings from the frontal
cortex (Vyazovskiy and Tobler, 2005; Vyazovskiy et al., 2011; Hajnik et
al., 2013; Hayashi et al., 2015; Fisher et al., 2016). Furthermore, the
frontal cortex was an obvious choice for investigating the effects of aging
on the local slow wave homeostasis, as sleep EEG SWA has been shown to
have frontal predominance in both rats and mice (Schwierin et al., 1999;
Huber et al., 2000; Vyazovskiy et al., 2006a). The microwire array con-
sisted of 16 channels (2 rows each of 8 wires), with a wire diameter of
33 �m, electrode spacing 250 �m, row separation L-R 375 �m, and tip
angle of 45 degrees. Because of the curvature of the neocortex in the area
of interest, the arrays were customized so that one row of electrodes was
250 �m longer than the other (Fisher et al., 2016). A 1 � 2 mm craniot-
omy was made using a high-speed drill with midpoint coordinates rela-
tive to bregma as follows: anteroposterior 1.5–2 mm, mediolateral 2 mm.
Dorsal ventral coordinates were taken when the longer row of electrodes
was touching the surface of the brain and the arrays were lowered below
the pial surface into deep layers of the motor cortex. A two-component
silicon gel (KwikSil; World Precision Instruments) was used to seal the
craniotomy and protect the surface of the brain from the dental acrylic
used to fix the array to the skull.
Animals were all monitored closely after surgery and scored daily for
measures, such as grimace, appearance, natural behavior, and provoked
behavior, until they were deemed to have returned to baseline for a
minimum of 2 d. Mice were provided with appropriate analgesia as nec-
essary (dexamethasone 0.2 mg/kg for 2 d and metacam 1–2 mg/kg for a
minimum of 3 d). The animals were closely monitored after surgery for,
on average, 6.1 � 0.4, 6.7 � 0.6, and 9.7 � 0.9 d, for EA, LA, and OA mice,
respectively. Therefore, OA animals took �3 d longer to recover from
surgery compared with both EA and LA mice (Kruskal–Wallis with
Mann–Whitney post hoc: �(2)
2
� 13.684, P � 0.0001; EA vs OA p �
0.0001, LA vs OA p � 0.004).
Signal processing, vigilance state scoring, and analysis. A Tucker-Davis
Technologies Multichannel Neurophysiology Recording System was
used for data acquisition. Cortical EEG was recorded from frontal and
occipital derivations. EEG, EMG, and LFP data were filtered between 0.1
and 100 Hz, amplified (PZ5 NeuroDigitizer preamplifier, Tucker-Davis
Technologies), and stored on a local computer at a sampling rate of 256.9
Hz. Extracellular neuronal spike data were recorded from the microwire
array at a sampling rate of 25 kHz (filtered between 300 Hz and 5 kHz). As
an initial step, online spike sorting was performed using OpenEx soft-
ware (Tucker-Davis Technologies) by manually applying an amplitude
threshold for online spike detection to eliminate artifactual waveforms
caused by electrical or mechanical noise. Spikes that exceeded this pre-
defined threshold (�2� noise level, at least �25 �V) were stored as 46
samples (0.48 ms before, 1.36 ms after the threshold crossing) consisting
of both voltage measures and time stamps. LFP, EEG, and EMG data were
then resampled offline at a sampling rate of 256 Hz. Custom-written
MATLAB scripts (The MathWorks) were used for signal conversion.
Data were then transformed into European Data Format using open
source Neurotraces software.
Recordings were subdivided into 4 s epochs and vigilance states scored
offline by manual inspection of the signal (SleepSign, Kissei Comtec).
Two EEG channels (frontal and occipital), EMG, two channels of MUA,
andRWactivityweresimultaneouslydisplayedtoaidvigilancestatescoring.
Vigilance states were classified as waking (low-voltage, high-frequency EEG
withahighlevelorphasicEMGactivity),NREMsleep(presenceofEEGslow
waves, a signal of a high amplitude and low frequency), or REM sleep (low-
voltage, high-frequency EEG with a low level of EMG activity). Vigilance
state artifacts in at least one EEG or MUA recording channel, resulting
from contamination by eating, drinking, or gross movements were also
scored as artifacts so that they may be removed from appropriate analyses
(percentage of total recording time: EA, 8.7 � 3.1; LA, 8.8 � 2.3; OA,
7.9 � 3.5). After the data were scored, EEG and LFP power spectra were
computed by an FFT routine for 4 s epochs (Hanning window), with a
0.25 Hz resolution (SleepSign, Kissei Comtec).
Experimental design and statistical analysis. Because our primary aim
was to investigate the effects of physiological healthy aging on spontane-
ous waking and sleep, rather than the effects of specific manipulations
beyond the conventional SD, all experiments were performed under
standard laboratory conditions, where mice were kept under a 12 h
light:12 h dark cycle in their home-cage environment. Mice were trans-
ferred to the recording chambers and habituated to both the cage and
recording cables for a minimum of 3 d before recording, until patterns of
activity showed normal entrainment, as previously described (Cui et al.,
2014; Fisher et al., 2016). On the day following the baseline recording, a
6 h SD was performed to investigate the effect of prolonged wakefulness
on cortical activity. This was performed based on previous evidence that
older mice may have a reduced capacity to respond to an increased sleep
pressure (Hasan et al., 2012). SD was performed for 6 h starting at light
onset using the well-established gentle handling technique (Vyazovskiy
et al., 2002). Mouse behavior and polysomnographic recordings were
constantly monitored; and when mice showed signs of sleepiness, the
experimenter provided the animal with novel objects. This method is
thought to mimic naturalistic waking conditions in an ethologically rel-
evant manner, which is less stressful for the animals compared with other
SD methods. Novel objects included cardboard, colorful plastic, and
tissue paper. During SD, the animals repeatedly attempted to initiate
sleep, and EA, LA, and OA mice slept, on average, 5.9 � 0.9, 7.4 � 2.7,
and 12.3 � 2.1 min, respectively, during the 6 h period.
For specific analyses, some mice were excluded for technical reasons,
as stated in the figure legends. Data were analyzed using MATLAB and
SPSS (IBM, released 2016; SPSS Statistics for Windows, version 24.0,
McKillop et al. • Aging and Cortical Neural Dynamics in Mice
J. Neurosci., April 18, 2018 • 38(16):3911–3928 • 3913
 IBM). In most cases, ANOVAs were used to
identify differences between the three age
groups. In cases where data failed homogeneity
testing, a Welch F test with Games–Howell post
hoc test was used instead. Where data failed
normality testing, nonparametric Kruskal–
Wallis tests, with Mann–Whitney post hoc tests
were used. Critical p values were adjusted for
multiple testing (p/number of tests), and only
those values that reached the more stringent
criteria are reported. For time course data,
repeated-measures ANOVAs were used to
identify differences. In a few cases where the
animals did not sleep during a specific interval,
the data for corresponding time points were
estimated using a multiple imputation tech-
nique within SPSS (5 imputations used). De-
tails of the specific statistical tests used are
provided in the appropriate figure legends. Ef-
fect sizes were estimated by calculating Cohen’s
d (Lakens, 2013) for main findings. All values
reported are mean � SEM, unless explicitly
stated.
Analysis of extracellular neuronal activity. To
investigate putative single-unit activity, we per-
formed offline spike sorting, as previously de-
scribed (Fisher et al., 2016). For spike sorting,
we concatenated either a baseline light and
dark period or a baseline light period and SD
light period. An artifact removal procedure was
used using custom written MATLAB scripts, to
eliminate remaining artifactual waveforms. A
principal component analysis was then per-
formed on a segment of the spike waveform
between the fifth and 35th time stamps as this
segment is more informative about the overall
spike waveform. After performing principal
component analysis, each spike between sam-
ples 5 and 35 was described by 31 variables,
each being a linear combination of the original
sampling values. Clustering was then per-
formed based on a k-means algorithm (Jolliffe,
2002), a partitioning method that aims to di-
vide n observations into k clusters in which
each observation belongs to the cluster with the
nearest mean, serving as a prototype of the clus-
ter. We used the k-means function in MATLAB,
which was implemented according to Lloyd’s
algorithm (Lloyd, 1982). This approach re-
quires the user to a priori select the number of
clusters. All selected clusters were manually classified into k � 1, 2, 3, 4, or
5 clusters, and the best representation for that spike was visually classified
based on the average spike waveform with SD, interspike interval distri-
bution, the time course of peak-to-peak amplitude across the recording
period, the corresponding time course of average firing rates, and the
autocorellogram of the spike train. This was only performed for up to 5
clusters as it was unlikely that more than five clusters would occur in the
same MUA electrode. To ensure cluster quality and stability, clusters
were then further classified based on their signal-to-noise ratio, wave-
shape of the action potential, stability of the amplitude across time and
ISI distribution histogram, and spurious or unstable clusters were ex-
cluded from the analysis as previously (Fisher et al., 2016).
Association between LFP slow waves and neuronal OFF periods. Popu-
lation OFF periods were defined as periods of total neuronal silence
across all 16 electrodes, which were consistently associated with LFP slow
waves. To detect OFF periods, we first concatenated all individual spikes
and detected periods of silence lasting at least 20 ms and not exceeding
1000 ms. Next, we arranged all OFF periods into 100 1% percentiles and
calculated the average LFP wave (mean between all recording channels)
triggered to the onset of the corresponding OFF period (Fig. 1). This
analysis revealed an exquisite sensitivity of the LFP to the occurrence of
neuronal silence, and the size of the resulting LFP slow wave increased
progressively as a function of longer OFF periods (Fig. 1). Subsequently,
we defined OFF periods as periods of network silence, which were asso-
ciated with a slow wave at least 50% the amplitude of the largest slow
waves (100th percentile) and were therefore associated with the longest
OFF periods in each animal (Fig. 1). To investigate the relationship be-
tween neuronal activity and LFP slow waves, two complementary ap-
proaches were used. First, the LFP signal was bandpass filtered between
0.5 and 4 Hz (stopband edge frequencies 0.3–8 Hz) with MATLAB filtfilt
function exploiting a Chebyshev Type II filter design (Achermann and
Borbe
´ly, 1997; Vyazovskiy et al., 2009b; Fisher et al., 2016), and waves
were detected as positive deflections of the filtered LFP signal between
two consecutive negative deflections below the zero-crossing. Only LFP
waves with a peak amplitude larger than the median amplitude across all
detected waves during baseline NREM sleep were included in subse-
quent analyses. Subsequently, all slow waves were aligned to their posi-
tive peak, and the corresponding profile of neuronal spiking was computed.

 Second, we detected OFF periods as described above and calculated the
average LFP aligned to the onset of an OFF period. The incidence of
OFF periods and slow waves as well as the duration of OFF periods were
used in subsequent analyses to investigate age-dependent differences in
neuronal network activity.
Neuronal “phenotyping” and vigilance-state dependency of cortical firing.
After spike sorting, we performed a characterization of the firing rates of
the identified putative single units. The firing rates (i.e., the number of
spikes per 1 s) of each neuron were determined for each 4 s epoch in
artifact-free wake, NREM sleep, and REM sleep, and their distribution
was plotted as a function of firing rate. This revealed a large variability in
the vigilance-state specificity of neuronal firing across putative single
units; with some neurons firing similarly across vigilance-states, whereas
others fired at different frequencies according to vigilance-state. To vi-
sualize this variability across putative neurons, the predominant firing
frequencies for each putative neuron was extracted from their respective
histogram of the distribution of their firing rates. Neurons were then
sorted according to their peak frequency and plotted in ascending order.
The distribution width of the firing rates histogram was calculated sepa-
rately for each state and age group as previously described (Fisher et al.,
2016).
Histological verification of recording site. At the end of the study, the
electrode recording sites were confirmed using previously described his-
tological methods (Fisher et al., 2016). Briefly, mice were transcardially
perfused with 0.9% saline followed by 4% PFA solution. Brains were
photographed to aid determination of electrode position, and then sec-
tioned into 50 �m coronal slices using a freezing microtome. Sections
were mounted onto slides and visualized using a fluorescence micro-
scope. Before implantation, array electrodes were coated with a thin layer
of DiI fluorescent dye (DiIC18(3), Invitrogen), to aid the identification
of electrode tracts.
Results
The daily architecture of sleep is markedly altered in
older mice
To investigate the age-dependent changes in cortical activity dur-
ing waking and sleep, we performed continuous recordings of
EEG, along with LFPs and extracellular neuronal activity (MUA)
from deep cortical layers of the primary motor cortex (M1) of
freely moving C57BL/6J mice. Consistent with previous reports

 et al., 2013; Panagiotou et al., 2017), we found that the older mice
hadareducedamountofwakefulness(repeated-measuresANOVA:
factor age: F(2,28) � 20.6, p � 0.0001, age � time interval: F(11,157) �
4.8, p � 0.0001), and an increased amount of NREM sleep
(repeated-measures ANOVA: factor age: F(2,28) � 21.0, p �
0.0001, age � time interval: F(11,153) � 4.4, p � 0.0001), but not
REM sleep (repeated-measures ANOVA: factor age: not signifi-
cant, age � time interval: F(12,169) � 3.8, p � 0.0001), during
baseline recording days, particularly during the dark period (Fig.
2A,B). This resulted in a substantial increase in the total daily
amount of sleep in older mice (percentage of recording time: EA,
47.0 � 1.0%; LA, 50.6 � 1.5%; OA, 57.1 � 0.8%; Welch F test:
F(2,18) � 31.3, p � 0.0001; Fig. 2D). However, calculating the
activity onset in each animal based on EEG/EMG defined wake-
fulness after lights off revealed that most animals were awake within
minutesfromdarkonset,regardlessofage(EA,0.8�0.3;OA,1.1�
0.5; LA, 1.1 � 0.3 min; not significant, Wilcoxon test).
Body weight also increased with age (EA, 26.4 � 0.9; LA,
31.5 � 0.6; OA, 34.1 � 1.3; Welch F test: F(2,17) � 15.7, g �
0.0001; Fig. 2C) and notably, both age and body weight showed a
significant positive relationship with the total amount of sleep
during 24 h (Fig. 2D). Because waking activities have an influence
on the amount and distribution of sleep across 24 h (Vyazovskiy
et al., 2006a; Vyazovskiy and Tobler, 2012; Fisher et al., 2016), we
calculated the amount of RW activity in the three age groups. As
expected, although all animals had free access to a RW through-
out the experiment, younger mice used it more extensively than
older mice (RW revolutions per hour of waking: EA, 485.8 �
87.0; LA, 280.8 � 84.7; OA, 38.1 � 20.6; Welch F test: F(2,15) �
15.0, p � 0.0001). Therefore, the pronounced age-dependent
reduction in the amount of waking during the dark period (EA,
9.1 � 0.3 h; LA, 8.0 � 0.5 h; OA, 6.3 � 0.2 h; Welch F test: F(2,17) �
29.9, p � 0.0001) could merely reflect the reduced tendency for
older animals to engage in continuous wheel running (Vyazovs-
kiy et al., 2006a; Fisher et al., 2016). Consistently, the amount of
waking was positively associated with RW activity across all ages
(r � 0.84, p � 0.001). It should be noted, however, that causality
and the directionality of the relationship between RW-activity
and the capacity to sustain consolidated waking are difficult to
determineusingcorrelationanalyses.Furthermore,becausesponta-
neous wheel running is associated with substantial changes in corti-
cal neuronal firing (Fisher et al., 2016) and may reflect a shift from
preferentially goal-directed to automatic, habit-like behaviors
(Vyazovskiy et al., 2017), the possibility remains that the global
change in sleep–wake architecture with aging is mechanistically
associated with specific changes in cortical circuit activity. If this
were the case, it may be expected that such changes would be
most readily detected in spontaneous patterns of network oscil-
lations during sleep.
The number of LFP slow waves and population OFF periods is
increased with aging
As is well established, EEG and LFP slow waves during NREM
sleep are associated with characteristic changes in the membrane
potential of cortical neurons, which give rise to synchronous
transitions across cortical neuronal populations between periods
of activity (ON periods) and silence (OFF periods) (Destexhe et
al., 2007; Nir et al., 2011; Vyazovskiy and Harris, 2013; Lemieux
et al., 2015; Rodriguez et al., 2016). Based on this, our first ques-
tion was to determine whether these neuronal correlates of LFP
slow waves are altered in older animals. In contrast to previous
human studies showing that EEG slow waves are markedly reduced
with aging, we observed that the LFP and MUA signals were similar
across age groups, and visual inspection of the signals alone was not
sufficient to differentiate between the age groups (Fig. 3A; represen-
tative recordings of LFP and MUA signals from individual mice
from EA and OA age groups are shown in Movies 1, 2). In all three
ages, LFP traces during NREM sleep were characterized by pro-
nounced positive slow waves associated with an unequivocal
suppression of MUA in the corresponding channels, typically
encompassing most, if not all, recording channels. Calculation of
the average MUA triggered by individual slow waves confirmed
this and revealed a suppression of neural spiking in association
with slow waves in all age groups (Fig. 3B). Consistent with a
recent report (Panagiotou et al., 2017), LA and OA mice were
found to have significantly higher EEG spectral power density in
slow frequencies (�10 Hz) compared with young controls (Fig.
3C), yet the difference did not reach significance when we com-
pared spectral power of the LFP (Fig. 3C). This contradicts hu-
man studies (Dijk et al., 1989; Landolt and Borbe
´ly, 2001; Mander
et al., 2013), which instead report a decrease in EEG spectral
power in the SWA frequency range with age.
Because EEG and LFP are influenced by both distant and local
sources, reflect volume conduction, and may also be entrained by
oscillations occurring elsewhere in the cortex (Sirota et al., 2008),
we next focused on investigating the activity of cortical neurons.
First, to assess the relationship between LFP slow waves and the
underlying local neural activity, all detected OFF periods were
aligned to their onset and the corresponding LFP signals were
averaged. LFP slow waves were exquisitely sensitive to the dura-
tion of corresponding OFF periods in all ages, with the amplitude
of slow waves progressively increasing with a lengthening of OFF
period duration (Fig. 1). Notably, the average amplitude of the

 slow wave triggered by OFF periods was reduced in both LA and
OA mice compared with EA mice (ANOVA: F(2,28) � 4.9, p �
0.015; Fig. 3D,E), despite similar average OFF period durations
(EA, 133.9 ms; LA, 141.9 ms; OA, 140.0 ms; not significant). This
suggests that the spiking activity and silence of individual cortical
neurons may, to some extent, be uncoupled from the slow net-
work LFP oscillation in older animals. To further address this, we
calculated the average incidence of LFP slow waves and popula-
tion OFF periods during an undisturbed baseline 12 h light pe-
riod. Interestingly, the incidence of both increased significantly
with age (slow wave incidence: Welch F test: F(2,18) � 24.9, p �
0.0001, OFF period incidence: one-way ANOVA: F(2,28) � 3.9,
p � 0.031; Fig. 3F), with the majority of effect sizes correspond-
ing to large effects as per Cohen’s convention (Lakens, 2013)
(slow wave incidence: d � �3.20, d � �0.84, d � �0.96; OFF
period incidence: d � �1.15, d � �1.17, d � 0.07; for EA vs OA,
EA vs LA, and LA vs OA, respectively).
The response of local cortical network activity to SD is intact
in older animals
It has been well described that, in laboratory rodents, EEG SWA
during NREM sleep decreases progressively during the light pe-
riod and is higher after prolonged spontaneous wakefulness or
SD (Tobler and Borbe
´ly, 1986; Vyazovskiy et al., 2009b, 2011).
These dynamics are associated with a higher incidence of slow
waves and neuronal OFF periods, which are considered markers
of increased physiological sleep pressure at the network level
(Vyazovskiy et al., 2007, 2009b; Rodriguez et al., 2016). There-
fore, we next investigated the dynamics of both measures of net-
work activity across the baseline 12 h light period, when mice are
predominantly asleep, and then performed SD the following day
to determine the effect of prolonged wakefulness on these mea-
sures. We found that the incidence of both slow waves and OFF
periods as well as the duration of OFF periods decreased signifi-
cantly across the baseline light period in all three age groups
(repeated-measures ANOVAs: slow wave incidence factor time
interval, F(5,96) � 19.6, p � 0.0001, Fig. 4C; OFF period incidence
factor time interval, F(4,74) � 12, p � 0.0001, Fig. 4D; OFF period
duration factor time interval, F(6,116) � 13.6, p � 0.0001, Fig. 4E);
however, only the time course of OFF period incidence was sig-
nificantly different between age groups (repeated-measures
ANOVA: factor age F(2,21) � 7, p � 0.005; EA vs LA, p � 0.009; LA
vs OA, p � 0.01).
Previous studies have suggested that older humans and ro-
dents have a reduced capacity to generate a rebound in SWA in
response to SD, with enhanced age-dependent differences found
to occur after SD (Mu
¨nch et al., 2004; Lafortune et al., 2012;
Wimmer et al., 2013). Interestingly, in our study, we observed a
robust increase in SWA after SD in all three ages (individual plots,
Fig. 4A), with no age differences identified for the time course of
SWA in the 6 h of recovery sleep after SD, for either the frontal
EEG or LFP (Fig. 4B). The initial levels of SWA in the frontal EEG
derivation were attenuated in OA mice (EA, 218.1 � 8.5; LA,
197.8 � 7.3; OA, 181.1 � 8.3; ANOVA factor age, F(2,18) � 5.4,
p � 0.015; Fig. 4B), whereas no significant age differences were
identified for the LFP SWA. Effect sizes were calculated for the
first hour after SD, a time point at which the main compensatory
effect of SD is observed. Large effect sizes were observed for com-
parisons of EA versus OA (EEG, d � 1.55; LFP, d � 1.01) and EA
versus LA (EEG, d � 1.00; LFP, d � 1.00), whereas small or
medium effect sizes were observed for LA versus OA comparisons
(EEG, d � 0.74; LFP, d � 0.04). The incidence of slow waves and
OFF periods as well as the duration of OFF periods were signifi-
cantly higher after SD compared with the same 6 h of the baseline
recording day in all three ages (repeated-measures ANOVA fac-
tor day: slow wave incidence, F(1,42) � 108.6, p � 0.0001, Fig. 4C;
OFF period incidence, F(1,42) � 29.9, p � 0.0001, Fig. 4D; OFF
period duration, F(1,42) � 84.5, p � 0.0001, Fig. 4E). This increase
after SD was not significantly different between age groups
(ANOVA, factor age; slow wave incidence, F(2,42) � 0.185, p �
0.832, Fig. 4C; OFF period incidence, F(2,42) � 0.99, p � 0.38, Fig.
4D; OFF period duration, F(2,42) � 2.776, p � 0.074, Fig. 4E).
Effect sizes were then calculated for the first hour after SD. For
slow wave incidence, a large effect size was detected for EA versus
OA comparisons (d � 1.02), whereas medium effect sizes were
detected for EA versus LA (d � 0.62) and LA versus OA (d �
0.62) comparisons. For OFF period incidence, medium effect
sizes were detected for EA versus OA (d � 0.51) and EA versus LA
(d � 0.52) comparisons, whereas LA versus OA comparisons
only revealed a small effect size (d � �0.09). In contrast, OFF
period duration only had small effect sizes for EA versus LA (d �
0.39) and LA versus OA (d � �0.46) comparisons, whereas the
EA versus OA comparison had a medium to large effect size (d �
�0.75). All three age groups showed a comparable gradual de-
crease in slow wave incidence, OFF period incidence, and OFF
period duration over the 6 h recovery after SD (repeated-measures
ANOVA factor time interval: slow wave incidence, F(3,53) � 61.3,
p � 0.0001, Fig. 4C; OFF period incidence, F(2,35) � 50.0, p �
0.0001, Fig. 4D; OFF period duration, F(3,56) � 54.1, p � 0.0001,
Fig. 4E; factor time interval � age: slow wave incidence, F(5,53) �
1.6, p � 0.179, Fig. 4C; OFF period incidence, F(3,35) � 1.7, p �
0.142, Fig. 4D; OFF period duration, F(5,56) � 0.654, p � 0.67, Fig.
4E). Therefore, in our study, the response to SD was not markedly
different between age groups, apart from in the initial level of
EEG SWA in the frontal derivation. The possibility remains that
the pronounced baseline differences in the amount of sleep be-
tween ages could influence the homeostatic response after SD.
Indeed, correlation analyses revealed a negative relationship
between the amount of NREM sleep during the baseline dark
period before SD and the magnitude of the increase in the
incidence of slow waves and OFF periods (p � 0.05 for both).
It has previously been suggested that the higher absolute EEG
SWA observed in older animals may reflect higher sleep pressure
(Panagiotou et al., 2017). One of the established markers of
higher sleep propensity is a faster buildup of SWA within NREM
sleep episodes. To address whether this increase is present in
older animals, we quantified the incidence of LFP slow waves and
OFF periods in the first 2 min after the onset of an NREM sleep
episode, during both baseline recordings and after SD. Inter-
estingly, while EA mice showed a robust increase in both pa-
rameters after SD, this was largely attenuated or absent in LA
and OA mice (percentage change in SW incidence relative to
baseline: EA 20.3 � 5.5; LA 2.0 � 5.5; OA �3.9 � 4.7, one-way
ANOVA factor age F(2,21) � 5.8, p � 0.01; OFF period inci-
dence: EA 50.1 � 14.1; LA �7.6 � 7.6; OA �2.3 � 18.3;

2
� 8.214, p � 0.014, with a mean rank
score of 18.86 for EA, 10.86 for LA, and 9.2 for OA mice). One
possibility is that this may reflect a reduced capacity to engage
in deeper NREM sleep with aging, perhaps due to increased
neuronal activity or excitability during NREM sleep (Klerman
and Dijk, 2008). On the other hand, as the older animals had a
higher absolute number of slow waves and OFF periods (Fig.
3F), there may be a ceiling effect taking place, in which no
further increase is possible.

McKillop et al. • Aging and Cortical Neural Dynamics in Mice
 The dynamic repertoire of the activity of single neurons
during wake and sleep is largely stable across the life span
The age-dependent changes in neuronal population activity we
observed may arise either at a single-cell level or reflect larger
scale processes, such as global neuromodulation. Therefore, next
we investigated the effect of aging on the vigilance state-specific
discharge of individual cortical neurons. On average, of 16 mi-
crowire channels, 9.2 � 1.0, 9.3 � 1.0, and 9.2 � 1.0 channels
showed robust MUA in EA, LA, and OA animals, respectively,
and subsequent spike sorting resulted in 17.4 � 2.9, 15.6 � 1.7,
and 16.7 � 2.5 putative single units detected per animal, which
was not significantly different between ages. Previous studies sug-
gest that the distribution of firing rates between individual neu-
rons is best characterized by a log-normal distribution, which
renders calculating the mean firing rate or averaging between
individual neurons inappropriate (Watson et al., 2016). There-
fore, we plotted the distribution of firing rates across neurons,
which revealed that the older groups of mice had a somewhat
higher proportion of slow spiking neurons (Fig. 5A). However, it
is possible that this may be related to the higher amount and
presumably intensity of waking in EA animals, compared with LA
and OA mice.
It should be noted that the distribution of firing activity within
individual neurons is also highly variable (Fisher et al., 2016) and
often deviates from normality (Fig. 5B). This therefore also poses
a problem for calculating average firing rates within individual
Figure4.

 neurons. Previous studies suggest that cortical neurons change
their firing characteristics depending on the global behavioral
state, although a great variability between individual neurons and
cortical regions has been noted (Hobson and McCarley, 1971;
Vyazovskiy et al., 2009b; Fisher et al., 2016; Niethard et al., 2016).
For example, it is typically observed that neurons fire at a higher
rate during waking and REM sleep compared with NREM sleep
(Vyazovskiy et al., 2009b), although this is not always the case,
and this may be influenced by the recording technique or by the
cortical region being recorded (Hobson and McCarley, 1971; Ni-
ethard et al., 2016). The firing rates of cortical neurons are deter-
mined by their electrophysiological characteristics, connectivity
pattern, ongoing behavior, or preceding sleep–wake history
(O’Keefe and Dostrovsky, 1971; Ascoli et al., 2008; Poulet and
Petersen, 2008; Kropff et al., 2015; McGinley et al., 2015; Fisher et
al., 2016). We therefore performed neuronal “phenotyping” by
calculating, for each putative single neuron, the distribution of
their firing rates across all 4 s epochs of NREM sleep, REM sleep,
and waking separately (Fig. 5B,C). Individual neurons were highly
idiosyncratic with respect to their state-dependent firing (Fig.
5B), and so we hypothesized that neurons could be subdivided
into distinct categories based on the distribution of their spiking
activity during waking and sleep, as is traditionally done for sub-
cortical areas where sleep- or wake-active neurons have been
identified (Jones, 2005). To this end, we determined the peak
frequency for each putative single unit based on a histogram of its
firing rates (examples shown in Fig. 5B) and then plotted the
histograms separately for each vigilance state (Fig. 5C). Interest-
ingly, we observed that cortical neurons could not be subdivided
into distinct categories based on their firing rates, but instead they
formed a continuum, where virtually any firing phenotype could
be observed within each vigilance state (Fig. 5C). Furthermore,

McKillop et al. • Aging and Cortical Neural Dynamics in Mice
 the distribution of cortical neurons as a function of their firing
rates was visually indistinguishable between ages (Fig. 5C). On
average, 13.7 � 3.3%, 15.9 � 6.6%, and 14.5 � 4.5% of all puta-
tive single units, in EA, LA, and OA mice, respectively, discharged
at a higher average firing rate during sleep (including both NREM
and REM sleep) compared with waking, and the proportion of
such “sleep-active” cortical neurons was similar between ages.
However, plotting the distribution of individual neurons as a
function of their spiking activity revealed that during wake faster
spiking neurons were more common in EA mice (Fig. 5D). This
effect is likely accounted for by a higher amount of waking and
increased levels of arousal in general in younger animals. It
should be noted that, although during wheel running the older
animals did not attain the same speed as the younger animals, we
observed a negative relationship between the firing rates of indi-
vidual putative neurons and running speed in all three age
groups, consistent with our previous study performed in younger
animals (Fisher et al., 2016). Furthermore, the distribution of
neurons as a function of their spiking activity during spontane-
ous NREM and REM sleep also did not reveal any noticeable
differences between ages (Fig. 5D). Finally, as previous studies
have shown that the distribution width of the firing rates during
waking is influenced by behavior (Fisher et al., 2016), we next
addressed whether this is also different between ages. No statisti-
cal differences were observed in the firing rate distribution widths
between age groups, for any vigilance state (Fig. 5E). Therefore, as
mice get older, the overall composition of fast-spiking and slow-
spiking, as well as “sleep-active” and “wake-active” cortical neu-
rons appears stable, and neurons largely retain their vigilance
state-dependent firing profile. This suggests that the dynamic
repertoire of the activity of single neurons during both waking
and sleep is stable across the lifespan. This observation is inter-
esting as it suggests an intriguing possibility that the mechanisms
underlying the gross alteration of the daily sleep–wake distribu-
tion are distinct from those implicated in the regulation of local
cortical states.
Persistently firing cortical “sleep-active” neurons are more
abundant in older animals
We next asked whether the age-dependent changes in sleep and
wake could be reflected in the neuronal dynamics at vigilance
state transitions, such as at the onset of individual NREM sleep
episodes (Fig. 6A). We suggest that this might be the case for two
reasons. First, the overall amount of NREM sleep was substan-
tially higher in older animals (one-way ANOVA: F(2,28) � 23.7,
p � 0.0001; Fig. 6B), whereas the number of transitions into
NREM sleep was also significantly higher in older animals (one-
way ANOVA F(2,28) � 26.9, p � 0.0001; Fig. 6C). Because it has
been hypothesized that sleep is a cortical circuit phenomenon that
maybeinitiatedbylocalnetworks(Pigarevetal.,1997;Kruegeretal.,
2008; Hinard et al., 2012; Lemieux et al., 2014; Sanchez-Vives and
Mattia,2014),it is reasonable to assume that the neuronal dynam-
ics involved in sleep initiation may be different depending on the
level of local sleep propensity. Previous studies showed that, as an
animal transitions into NREM sleep, overall firing rates become
progressively slower, possibly due to the occurrence of neuronal
silent periods (Vyazovskiy et al., 2009b). At the same time, it has
previously been shown that SWA, as well as the amplitude of slow
waves, increases progressively during the first 1–2 min after
NREM sleep onset, reflecting a progressive increase in sleep depth
(Vyazovskiy et al., 2009a; Cui et al., 2014). Consistently, we ob-
served an increase in relative slow wave incidence across the first
2 min of an NREM sleep episode, which was larger and more
rapid in EA mice compared with older animals (Fig. 6D). One
possible explanation for older animals having an attenuated
buildup of slow wave incidence is that the absolute incidence of
both slow waves and OFF periods was higher in older animals
throughout NREM sleep (Fig. 3F). However, curiously, the grad-
ual increase in the number of OFF periods during the first 2 min
of NREM sleep episodes did not differ noticeably between ages
(Fig. 6E).
We next plotted the neuronal firing activity of all individual
putative neurons across all animals during the first 2 min after the
onset of an NREM sleep episode. Once again, neurons did not fall
into distinct categories based on their dynamics in the first few
minutes after NREM sleep onset. Instead, we observed that, even
within a small cortical network, the recorded neurons presented
an entire spectrum of possible changes: with some neurons show-
ing a progressive increase in spiking in the initial minutes after
sleep onset, whereas other neurons did not change their spiking
activity or showed a pronounced decrease (Fig. 6F). It was appar-
ent, however, that, in OA mice, a somewhat larger proportion of
neurons increased their spiking activity in the initial few minutes
after the onset of NREM sleep episodes (Fig. 6F), which is con-
sistent with the observation that OA mice had a reduced relative
increase in the incidence of slow waves as sleep progressed into
the second minute (Kruskal–Wallis H test, �(2)
2
� 9.979, p �
0.007, with a mean rank age score of 23.22 for EA, 12.73 for LA,
and 11.6 for OA mice; Fig. 6G). This may suggest that, even
within individual NREM sleep episodes, the progression from a
relatively more superficial sleep to a deeper sleep is attenuated in
older animals. This was confirmed by the finding that older ani-
mals have more intense relative neuronal spiking in the second
minute of NREM sleep episodes (mean rank age scores 12.9 for
EA, 13.86 for LA, and 21.45 for OA mice, Kruskal–Wallis H test,
�(2)
2
� 6.4, p � 0.04; Fig. 6H,I). Effect sizes calculated for the
proportion of neurons that increased firing by at least 30% at the
onset of NREM sleep (Fig. 6I) revealed large effect sizes for EA
versus OA (d � �1.09) and LA versus OA (d � �1.06), with a
small effect size for EA versus LA (d � �0.07) comparisons. We
hypothesize that this could affect sleep intensity, making sleep
relatively more superficial and easier to disrupt, or it could reflect
local state instability (Doran et al., 2001; Parrino et al., 2012),
which may interfere with the restorative functions of sleep. How-
ever, the high incidence of cortical neurons that increased their
firing rates across NREM sleep episodes is somewhat surprising
and appears to contradict the occurrence of OFF periods, which
are associated with reduced neuronal spiking but were not altered
or even enhanced, in absolute terms, in older animals.
Aging does not affect the dynamics of cortical firing at
NREM-REM sleep transitions
Transitions between NREM and REM sleep (Fig. 7A) are charac-
terized by profound changes in cortical EEG, LFPs, and neuronal
activity (Vyazovskiy et al., 2009b; Funk et al., 2016; Niethard et
al., 2016), as well as marked changes across several subcortical
neuromodulatory systems (Fort et al., 2009; Van Dort et al., 2015;
Weber et al., 2015). Once again, we observed substantial variabil-
ity in the response of individual neurons to transitions between
NREM and REM sleep (Fig. 7B,C), whereas the overall number
of “REM-sleep active” cortical neurons was not different between
ages (Fig. 7D). Interestingly, a substantial proportion of neurons
exhibited very similar patterns of activity between NREM and
REM sleep. This supports the notion that both sleep states share
important common characteristics (Funk et al., 2016), and fur-
ther suggests that state-dependent changes in cortical activity

Discussion
Intensive research over the past few decades revealed numerous
effects of aging on sleep amount and architecture, as well as on
specific sleep oscillations in both humans and animals (Dijk et al.,
1989; Bliwise, 1993; Landolt and Borbe
´ly, 2001; Carrier et al.,
2011; Cirelli, 2012; Hasan et al., 2012; Lafortune et al., 2012; Rolls,
2012; Wimmer et al., 2013; Banks et al., 2016; Clawson et al.,
2016; Mander et al., 2017). However, neither the origin nor the
physiological significance of age-dependent changes in sleep is
fully understood, and the question remains whether aging is as-
sociated with a decreased capacity to generate sufficient sleep or a
reduced sleep need (Mander et al., 2017). Based on this, our study
had two overarching aims: (1) to determine whether the age-

 dependent changes observed at the level of EEG could be ex-
plained by the differences at the level of underlying neural
activity; and (2) to determine the role of local network mecha-
nisms in the previously observed global sleep disruptions. We
predicted that, if the aging process targets neocortical circuits in
the first place, this would manifest as a decreased occurrence of
network OFF periods during sleep, reduced homeostatic re-
sponse at the level of local neural activity, or an overall reduced
level of neural spiking. To our surprise, we demonstrated that,
although aging in mice is consistently associated with global
changes in the amount of sleep and its architecture, it does not
profoundly affect cortical neural activity. The only changes we
observed were increases in the incidence of local LFP slow waves
and corresponding population OFF periods during NREM sleep
with aging, and that a larger proportion of neurons discharged at
a higher rate upon sleep onset. Otherwise, vigilance state-related
patterns of cortical activity, and the homeostatic response to SD
measured at the level of neuronal population activity during
sleep, were intact in older animals. Our results suggest that local
cortical mechanisms of sleep regulation are not significantly im-
paired during healthy aging, making it unlikely that the global
sleep disruptions identified with aging arise from changes in local
cortical activity. We must therefore critically reconsider the no-
tion that local cortical mechanisms of slow-wave generation are
deficient in older humans, at least until intracranial recordings in
older human patients can be performed. Furthermore, our re-
sults may shed light on why earlier studies report conflicting
results, specifically with respect to findings obtained in humans
and laboratory animals.
One of the most intriguing observations of our study is that
aging has few effects on cortical local neural activity despite pro-
found effects on global brain activity and the daily sleep–wake
architecture, as identified in numerous studies (Dijk et al., 1989;
Bliwise, 1993; Landolt et al., 1996; Swaab et al., 2002; De Gennaro
and Ferrara, 2003; Feinberg and Campbell, 2003; Altena et al.,
2010; Colrain et al., 2010; Carrier et al., 2011; Mander et al., 2013,
2014; Martin et al., 2013; Dube
´ et al., 2015; Clawson et al., 2016),
as well as in this study. Evidence suggests that sleep and slow wave
oscillations emerge at the level of local neuronal populations as a
directconsequenceoffinesynapticmodificationsorlocalchangesin
neuronal connectivity arising from specific preceding waking activ-
ities (Krueger and Tononi, 2011; Vyazovskiy and Harris, 2013).
Therefore, it could be expected that, if this regulatory mechanism
is impaired with aging, it should manifest as local disruptions in
cortical population activity. However, we found that, in older
animals, local neuronal networks are capable of entering and
sustaining consolidated OFF periods associated with local slow
waves (Fig. 3), and so this basic property of neuronal networks
remains intact with aging. Furthermore, we observed an increase
in the incidence of slow waves and OFF periods in older animals,
which may be indicative of increased sleep pressure (Esser et al.,
2007; Riedner et al., 2007; Vyazovskiy et al., 2007), as has been pre-
viously suggested based on EEG data (Panagiotou et al., 2017). Al-
though the circuit mechanisms behind the increased tendency of
a network to enter OFF periods remains to be determined, we
speculate that altered network excitability may play a role (Chen
et al., 2012; Lemieux et al., 2015; Neske, 2016). Consistent with
this hypothesis, it has been shown that aging is associated with a
loss of synaptic connections or a reduction in their stability (Mor-
rison and Baxter, 2012; Grillo et al., 2013). It is possible that the
higher incidence of local slow waves we observed in older mice
may also have a functional role, such as in the homeostatic rebal-
ancing or remodeling of synaptic networks, which has been asso-
ciated with sleep slow waves (Chauvette et al., 2012; Krueger et al.,
2013; Vyazovskiy and Harris, 2013; Tononi and Cirelli, 2014; Wat-
son et al., 2016; Sanchez-Vives et al., 2017). However, we also ob-
served that the homeostatic rebound of both slow waves and
neuronal OFF periods did not manifest marked differences between
age groups in our study. This observation is intriguing and contrasts
withpreviousreportsofreducedhomeostaticreboundinEEGSWA
in humans and mice (Wimmer et al., 2013; Mander et al., 2017).
It is possible that the direct comparison of changes in local net-
work activity and “global” EEG may not be adequate or precise
enough to determine the local mechanistic changes with aging, as
age-dependent changes may selectively target specific levels of
organization while sparing others.Althoughweperformedrecord-
ings of LFP and MUAs from the primary motor cortex, it remains to
be established whether associative areas, such as the prefrontal cor-
tex, or primary sensory areas would show similar effects. We
speculate that specific cortical and subcortical regions may be
differentially affected by aging, with some areas more sensitive
than others.
Earlier studies have revealed numerous notable discrepancies
between species with respect to the effects of aging on sleep. For
example, EEG SWA has been reported to be decreased in older
humans (Landolt et al., 1996), whereas recent evidence suggests
that in older mice SWA may instead be enhanced (Panagiotou et
al., 2017), which was confirmed in our study. On one hand, this
may reflect species differences in the effect of aging on sleep need
or the capacity to produce deep sleep stages (Klerman and Dijk,
2008). For example, differences between humans and mice may
be related to their body and/or brain size and differences in their
metabolic rates, which are associated with longevity and sleep
(Zepelin and Rechtschaffen, 1974; Allison and Cicchetti, 1976;
Siegel, 2005; Capellini et al., 2008; Herculano-Houzel, 2015).
Given the major role of ecological factors, such as diet and the risk
of predation, on the duration of sleep (Allison and Cicchetti,
1976; Siegel, 2005; Tobler, 2005; Capellini et al., 2008), it cannot
be excluded that these factors play an increasingly important role
in aging. At the same time, the capacity to engage cortical net-
works in global sleep may be differentially affected in organisms
with different brain sizes, regardless of whether the rate of age-
dependent synaptic loss is the same. Based on the evidence in
our study, we propose that different species may compensate for
the inability to engage in deep consolidated sleep in different ways.
For example, older humans may allow intrusions of sleep-like pat-
terns of activity into the awake state, whereas older mice may in-
crease the daily amount of global behavioral sleep. In addition, the
spatial scale of the recording methods used to record brain activity
in humans and mice differs substantially, with a single scalp elec-
trode in human studies likely recording activity from a larger
network than a microwire electrode implanted intracortically in
mice. To the best of our knowledge, intracranial recordings from
older humans have not been performed during sleep, and so it
remains to be determined whether the lack of age differences in
neuronal activity can be generalized across species. It is possible
that older humans may be perfectly capable of generating fully
fledged local slow waves and may indeed have an intact local
response to sleep loss.
An important conclusion of our study is that the mechanisms
underlying local sleep regulation are distinct from those changes
implicated in 24 h sleep–wake control. The effects of aging on the
amount and distribution of waking and sleep may be caused by a
variety of factors, such as a weaker entrainment to the light-dark
cycle or disruptions to the circadian system (Kondratova and
Kondratov, 2012; Banks et al., 2015, 2016; Nakamura et al., 2015),
fundamental changes in waking behavior (Gu et al., 2015; Fisher

McKillop et al. • Aging and Cortical Neural Dynamics in Mice
 et al., 2016) or energy homeostasis (Rolls, 2012). Notably, older
mice typically have an increased body weight and reduced loco-
motor activity (Kopp et al., 2006; Banks et al., 2015), which we
also demonstrate here and which may be important in determining
the overall sleep–wake architecture. It has recently been shown that
providing mice with RWs restores the daily distribution of waking
and sleep and improves the capacity to maintain consolidated
waking periods (Gu et al., 2015). In our study, all animals were
housed with RWs for the duration of the experiment; and although
wedidnotspecificallymanipulatetheamountandspeedofrunning,
we noted that the older animals not only ran in the wheels less but
they also did not attain the same running speed as younger mice.
However, all three age groups consistently showed a negative
relationship between the firing rates of individual putative neu-
rons and running speed, as we described previously in younger
animals (Fisher et al., 2016). Therefore, we surmise that, because
the older animals were less able to sustain consolidated wake
periods, possibly as a result of a diminished propensity for run-
ning, this resulted in less time spent in the “idling” default wake
mode with reduced cortical activity, as we previously suggested
(Fisher et al., 2016).
In conclusion, we report that healthy aging in mice does not
lead to marked changes in vigilance state-related local neural
activity, despite pronounced global changes in the daily amount
and distribution of waking and sleep. By and large, most basic
features of cortical activity during sleep were not altered by aging,
suggesting that powerful protective or compensatory mecha-
nisms may exist to maintain neural function in the neocortex
across the lifespan. Crucially, our results suggest that older mice
have an intact capacity to generate slow waves and a homeostatic
response to sleep loss at the local cortical level, whereas the global
sleep dynamics appear to be profoundly disrupted. Therefore,
this study importantly highlights that sleep disruption in aging
cannot be fully understood without taking into consideration the
level of organization and causal relationships or lack thereof be-
tween local and global aspects of sleep regulation.
