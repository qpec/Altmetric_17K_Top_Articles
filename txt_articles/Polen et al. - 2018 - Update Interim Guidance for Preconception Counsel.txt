On August 7, this report was posted as an MMWR Early Release 
on the MMWR website (https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr).
Zika virus infection can occur as a result of mosquitoborne or 
sexual transmission of the virus. Infection during pregnancy is a 
cause of fetal brain abnormalities and other serious birth defects 
(1,2). CDC has updated the interim guidance for men with 
possible Zika virus exposure who 1) are planning to conceive 
with their partner, or 2) want to prevent sexual transmission of 
Zika virus at any time (3). CDC now recommends that men 
with possible Zika virus exposure who are planning to conceive 
with their partner wait for at least 3 months after symptom onset 
(if symptomatic) or their last possible Zika virus exposure (if 
asymptomatic) before engaging in unprotected sex. CDC now 
also recommends that for couples who are not trying to conceive, 
men can consider using condoms or abstaining from sex for at 
least 3 months after symptom onset (if symptomatic) or their 
last possible Zika virus exposure (if asymptomatic) to minimize 
their risk for sexual transmission of Zika virus. All other guidance 
for Zika virus remains unchanged. The definition of possible 
Zika virus exposure remains unchanged and includes travel to or 
residence in an area with risk for Zika virus transmission (https://
wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/world-map-areas-with-zika) or sex 
without a condom with a partner who traveled to or lives in an 
area with risk for Zika virus transmission. CDC will continue to 
update recommendations as new information becomes available.
Review of Evidence
Primarily transmitted through the bite of an infected 
Aedes aegypti mosquito, Zika virus can also be transmitted 
through unprotected sex (i.e., without correct and consistent use 
of a condom) with an infected partner. As of July 3, 2018, 52 cases 
of confirmed sexual transmission of Zika virus infection have 
been reported in the United States since 2015 (https://www.cdc.
gov/zika/reporting/case-counts.html). Most documented reports 
of sexual transmission have involved transmission from a man 
to a woman (4); however, transmission also has been reported 
from a man to another man (5) and from a woman to a man (6).
Despite their limited generalizability to humans, preliminary 
data from animal studies suggest that sexual transmission of Zika 
virus during pregnancy might pose a higher risk to the fetus than 
mosquitoborne transmission. In female rhesus macaques, vaginal 
inoculation (as a model for sexual transmission) of Zika virus 
appeared to enhance viral dissemination to the female reproduc-
tive tract, compared with subcutaneous inoculation (7). In an 
immunodeficient mouse model, poorer maternal outcomes and 
higher fetal viral titers were observed when exposure was through 
sexual transmission rather than subcutaneous or intravaginal 
infection (8). Prevention of sexual transmission of Zika virus 
during pregnancy can reduce the risk for maternal infection and 
the potential for congenital Zika syndrome.
The risk for congenital Zika syndrome associated with 
maternal Zika virus infection during the periconceptional 
period is not known. Maternal infection with other viruses 
(e.g., rubella) during the periconceptional period have been 
associated with infection in the fetus and adverse pregnancy 
outcomes; although in some cases, the timing of infection 
relative to conception was uncertain (9–13). To date, there 
are no published data definitively linking Zika virus infection 
around the time of conception to adverse pregnancy outcomes.
Since the last update of this guidance on October 7, 2016 (3), 
additional evidence relevant to the assessment of risk for sexual 
transmission of Zika virus infection has been reported. A litera-
ture search of PubMed was performed to identify new human 
studies and data published in English since October 2016. 
References for included articles were also screened. Specific 
search terms used included “sexual transmission” or “semen” or 
“seminal fluid” and “Zika.” The search yielded 15 publications, 
including case reports, case series, and nine cohort studies, 
which were reviewed for new, primary data.
Among the currently available reports of sexual transmis-
sion of Zika virus, the longest period from symptom onset 
in the index case to potential sexual transmission to a partner 
was between 32–41 days (14); most reports indicate much 
shorter intervals (4). The longest period after symptom onset 
at which replication-competent (i.e., potentially infectious) 
virus has been detected in semen by culture or cytopathic 
effect was 69 days (15). No other studies reported potentially 
infectious Zika virus in semen specimens obtained ≥40 days 
after symptom onset (16–33).
Numerous publications have reported on the detection of 
Zika virus RNA in semen (4,15–41), although this might not 
indicate the presence of infectious virus at the time of sampling

or correlate with the potential for sexual transmission of infec-
tious virus. In the largest published cohort study to date, involv-
ing 184 men with confirmed symptomatic Zika virus infection 
from whom a baseline specimen and serial semen specimens 
were collected at 2-week intervals, Zika virus RNA shedding in 
semen declined during the 3 months after symptom onset (28). 
Overall, Zika virus RNA was detected in semen in 61% (22 of 
36); 43% (48 of 112); and 21% (28 of 131) of participants from 
whom specimens were collected within 30, 31–60, and 61–90 
days of illness onset, respectively. At >90 days after illness onset, 
semen of ≤7% of participants had detectable Zika virus RNA. 
The estimated mean time to clearance of Zika virus RNA from 
semen was 54 days (28). Another large cohort study conducted 
in Puerto Rico followed 117 men, 89 of whom provided semen 
specimens and reported similar results: at >90 days after illness 
onset 11% (8 of 74) of men had detectable RNA in semen 
(Gabriela Paz-Bailey, Division of Vectorborne Diseases, National 
Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases, CDC; 
personal communication, 2018) (32). Similar findings have been 
observed in smaller cohort studies (16,17,23,25,29,37,39).  Zika 
virus RNA has been detected in semen for as long as 370 days 
after symptom onset (17); however, detection for long periods 
is rare. Limited data suggest the incidence of Zika virus RNA 
shedding in semen and its persistence after infection are likely 
similar for symptomatic and asymptomatic men infected with 
Zika virus (40–42).
Guidance for Preconception Counseling and 
Prevention of Sexual Transmission
CDC’s last interim guidance released in October 2016 was 
based on the maximum duration of detection of Zika virus 
RNA in semen. In the last interim guidance, CDC recom-
mended that men with possible Zika virus exposure wait at least 
6 months after symptom onset (if symptomatic) or their last 
possible Zika virus exposure (if asymptomatic) before trying 
to conceive with their partner (3). New data published since 
then support an update to that interim guidance. CDC now 
recommends that men with possible Zika virus exposure who 
are planning to conceive with their partner wait for at least 
3 months after symptom onset (if symptomatic) or their last 
possible Zika virus exposure (if asymptomatic) before engag-
ing in unprotected sex. CDC now also recommends that for 
couples who are not trying to conceive, men can consider 
using condoms or abstaining from sex for at least 3 months 
after symptom onset (if symptomatic) or their last possible 
Zika virus exposure (if asymptomatic) to minimize their risk 
for sexual transmission of Zika virus. Recommendations for 
men with possible Zika virus exposure whose partner is preg-
nant remain unchanged; these couples should be advised to 
consistently and correctly use condoms during sex or abstain 
from sex for the duration of the pregnancy (Table).
CDC continues to recommend shared patient-provider deci-
sion making, in which couples and health care providers work 
together to make decisions about timeframes to wait before 
trying to conceive after possible Zika virus exposure. Some 
couples might choose to wait shorter or longer periods after 
possible Zika virus exposure, based on individual circumstances 
(e.g., age, fertility, or details of possible exposure), clinical 
judgment, and a balanced assessment of risks and expected 
outcomes. Other guidance for preconception counseling and 
prevention of sexual transmission of Zika virus after possible 
Zika virus exposure remains unchanged (3).

risk for Zika virus 
transmission and 
couple planning 
to conceive
The couple should use condoms or abstain from 
sex for at least 2 months after the female 
partner’s symptom onset (if symptomatic) or 
last possible Zika virus exposure (if 
asymptomatic). 
(No change in recommendation)*
Both partners travel to 
an area with risk for 
Zika virus transmission 
and couple planning 
to conceive
The couple should use condoms or abstain from 
sex for at least 3 months from the male partner’s 
symptom onset (if symptomatic) or last possible

provider about their plans for pregnancy, their 
risk for Zika virus infection, the possible health 
effects of Zika virus infection on a baby, and 
ways to protect themselves from Zika. If either 
partner develops symptoms of Zika virus 
infection or tests positive for Zika virus infection, 
the couple should follow the suggested 
timeframes listed above before trying to

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
Zika virus infection during pregnancy is a cause of serious 
birth defects. CDC previously released interim guidance on 
preconception counseling and prevention of sexual 
transmission of Zika virus in October 2016. 
What is added by this report?
CDC now recommends that men with possible Zika virus 
exposure who are planning to conceive with their partner wait 
at least 3 months after symptom onset or their last possible 
Zika virus exposure before engaging in unprotected sex. This 
updated timeframe also applies to prevent sexual transmission 
of Zika virus.
What are the implications for public health practice?
These recommendations provide couples planning pregnancy 
with updated timeframes expected to reduce the risk for fetal 
Zika virus infection.
