Campylobacter’s
complicated
dynamics
and
multiple
transmission routes have made it difficult to describe using a
mathematical framework. Vector-borne disease transmission
has been proposed as a potential transmission route of
Campylobacter with house flies acting as a mechanical vector.
This study aimed to (i) determine if a basic SIR compartment
model
that
included
flies
as
a
mechanical
vector
and
incorporated a seasonally forced environment compartment
could be used to capture the observed disease dynamics in
Ontario, Canada, and (ii) use this model to determine potential
changes
to
campylobacteriosis
incidence
using
predicted
changes to fly population size and fly activity under multiple
climate change scenarios. The model was fit to 1 year of data
and validated against 8 and 12 years of data. It accurately
captured the observed incidence. We then explored changes in
human disease incidence under multiple climate change
scenarios. When fly activity levels were at a 25% increase, our
model predicted a 28.15% increase in incidence by 2050 using
the medium–low emissions scenario and 30.20% increase
using the high emissions scenario. This model demonstrates
that the dynamics of Campylobacter transmission can be
captured
by
a
model
that
assumes
that
the
primary
transmission of the pathogen occurs via insect vectors.

 1. Background
Campylobacteriosis(theinfectioncausedbythebacteriaCampylobacter) affected21in100 000peopleinOntario
in 2017, making it the most common gastrointestinal illness in Canada [1]. Humans can contract these bacteria
fromawidevarietyofsourcesincluding:contaminatedfoodandwater,contactwithanimalsandanimalfaeces
and contact with an infected individual or their faecal matter [2–4]. In a study in Ontario, of domestic cases of
known exposure, 63% were food-related, 27% from contact with animals, 6% from other individuals and 3%
from contaminated water [5]. Also, Ravel et al. [6] researched campylobacteriosis source attribution through
exposure assessment and comparative genomic fingerprinting using isolates from clinical cases and
potential sources in Canada [7]. They found that chicken meat was the most common source (65–69%)
followed by contact with cattle or cattle faeces (14–19%), and lastly meat from cattle was of minor
importance [8]. This evidence suggests that contaminated food and contact with animals are of highest
importance as the source of campylobacteriosis in Canada.
Human campylobacteriosis exhibits seasonal fluctuations in disease incidence with peaks in the
summer months, June–August [8–12]. There are many hypotheses for the observed seasonality
including: environmental/climactic changes, human behavioural changes and, more recently, flies as
mechanical vectors and seasonal fluctuations in fly populations [9–11,13]. There is evidence that
campylobacteriosis is associated with certain environmental and climatic factors such as increased
temperatures, increased humidity and higher water flows [14–16]. As Campylobacter use the environment
to move between human and animal hosts, it is important to know how these bacteria are affected by
external factors.
It has also been noticed that the seasonal fluctuations in campylobacteriosis coincide with times of
highest fly population density and activity level [13]. It has been demonstrated that flies carry bacteria
including Campylobacter, and these bacteria can be transferred to food and surfaces from which
humans can then become infected [17]. Flies can also encounter these bacteria, carry them on their
bodies and transfer them among agricultural settings, such as between pens or barns, thus infecting
food animals which can then be contacted or consumed by humans [13].
This theory requires attention, as fly population size and activity are subject to increase along with the
number of flies surviving the winter season under predictions of climate change [18,19]. Climate change
is predicted to cause an increase in temperature, humidity and precipitation in Canada and places of
similar latitude [20]. It is also expected that the winter season will be shorter and warmer with more
precipitation falling as rain instead of snow [21]. In a study in the UK, temperature, humidity and
precipitation were all highly correlated with fly population size [18]. Using a model, these authors
projected the annual size of house fly populations under medium–low and high carbon emission
scenarios [18]. Their results suggest up to a 244% increase in fly population size by 2080 under a high
emissions scenario over the population in 2003 [18]. Fly activity is also predicted to increase as
temperatures rise [19]. Schou et al. [19] found that both sexes of house flies’ daytime activity increased
with temperature until a threshold of 30–358C, respectively. Therefore, as the ambient temperature
rises, flies may become more active throughout the day. Since house flies are very sensitive to changes
in the environment, it is important to know how flies may react to climate change and in turn change
the dynamics of campylobacteriosis.
A mathematical modelling framework can be used to simulate the spread of a pathogen through a
population of individuals in order to quantify disease outcomes, including the burden of disease, the
number of secondary cases arising from a single case (R0) and/or the population attack rate [20]. Models
can also be used to examine hypotheses related to data gaps, or disease prevention and intervention
strategies [20].
Simple compartmental models have been expanded to capture the dynamics of waterborne diseases
such as cholera [21–23]. In most cases, this was done by adding a water compartment into which
infected individuals shed the pathogen. Susceptible humans can then become infected by contact with
this infected water reservoir or by contact with an infected individual. This allows the model to capture
traditional person–person transmission (aka the ‘fast loop’ [22]) as well as person–water–person
transmission (or the ‘slow loop’ [22]). These types of models allow researchers to gain a more complete
picture of the disease dynamics as well as test the impact of intervening on the different transmission routes.
Compartmental models have also been expanded to model vector-borne infectious diseases, known
as Ross–MacDonald models [24–26]. Ross and MacDonald developed a model for mosquito-borne
pathogen transmission that included latency due to the pathogen’s life cycle [26,27]. In the Ross–
MacDonald model structure, a susceptible vector obtains the pathogen from a host during blood

2
 feeding. Once the pathogen has multiplied to a sufficient level in the vector, it can then be passed to a
new susceptible host during a subsequent feeding [24,25]. These models have been adopted as the
standard framework for many vector-borne diseases [26].
Owing to Campylobacter’s zoonotic disease dynamics and multiple transmission routes, it is acomplicated
host–pathogen system to model. Skelly and Weinstein modelled human campylobacteriosis that explicitly
looked at infection from aquatic environments contaminated by human and animal faeces (treated and
untreated water), and through food consumption, preparation and processing [27]. However, there are no
models that attempt to capture the observed seasonality either through the environment, through fly
dynamics or through these two sources in combination. The objectives of this study were to: (i) determine
if a basic SIR compartment model that incorporates flies as a mechanical vector, and also incorporates a
seasonally forced environmental reservoir compartment, could be used to capture the observed disease
dynamics in Ontario, Canada, and (ii) use this model to explore possible changes to campylobacteriosis
incidence using projected changes to fly population dynamics and fly activity level under different
climate change scenarios.
2. Methods
2.1. Case data
We used two sets of data to parametrize and validate our model. Firstly, we had access to confirmed
campylobacteriosis cases from Public Health Ontario (PHO) from 1 January 2005 to 31 December
2013. A positive individual had gastrointestinal illness symptoms and either the pathogen isolated
from stool or body fluids, or had an epidemiological link to one or more laboratory-confirmed cases.
The positive cases were reported to the integrated Public Health Information System (iPHIS). Cases
that had travelled outside of Ontario within the incubation period of Campylobacter were excluded as
it was assumed that these do not represent locally acquired cases. Over the 9-year period, there were
a total of 27 956 confirmed cases in Ontario. The campylobacteriosis cases showed seasonality, with
most cases occurring in the spring and summer months (June–September). The second form of data
was publicly available ‘Monthly Infectious Disease Surveillance Reports’ provided by PHO which is a
summation of cases from iPHIS on a provincial level.
2.2. Model structure
A deterministic SEIR model was developed that included the addition of an environmental reservoir (B).
This reservoir is a placeholder to include many of the potential transmission routes: contaminated water,
contaminated food, contact with animals and other environments contaminated by human and animal
faeces. The environmental reservoir is seasonally forced to account for the changing levels of bacteria
in the reservoir depending on the season. Campylobacter are sensitive to changes in the environment,
which results in variability in the bacterial load in the environmental reservoir dependent on the
season [8]. This dynamic occurs via direct changes to the biology of the bacteria in the environment
as well as changes in the other aspects of the environmental reservoir. For example, high temperature
and water levels are associated with increased odds of Campylobacter-positivity on farms [28]. This
could lead to increased shedding of the pathogen and therefore an increased environmental load [8].
High temperatures are also associated with increased carcass levels of Campylobacter on poultry which
could lead to increased risk of food contamination [10,29]. In order to mathematically allow for the
seasonal oscillation of the environmental compartment (B), an ‘environmental parameter’ was added
to the model (z). This parameter is a scaling/augmenting factor (refer to appendix A, equation (A 5)).
This SBEIR model was then further expanded to include house flies, Musca domestica, as mechanical
vectors (e.g. insects that carry the pathogen on the outside of the body and transmit through physical
contact [30]). In this model (figure 1), a susceptible human (Sh) can become infected in three different
ways: contact with an infectious human (bi), contact with the environmental reservoir (bb) or
consuming food that has been contaminated by a ‘contaminated’ fly (bf).
Susceptible flies enter the population at a seasonally fluctuating birth rate (mb) and leave the population
at a seasonal rate dependent on the number of flies in each compartment (md). The birth rate is seasonal
because egg laying rates and larval development times fluctuate with temperature [13,31]. Female flies
have more eggs in their lifetime at warmer temperatures (117.8+36.5 at 208C versus 494.9+73.2 at
308C) [32]. Also, warmer temperatures along with an increase in rainy days leads to larvae being able to

 develop into adult flies within days compared to months (tables 1 and 2) [13]. These two factors in
combination allow the fly population to increase exponentially as temperatures rise into the summer
months. The fly birth rate includes both fly births from domestic flies that survived the winter and the
influx of flies from warmer climates that occurs as temperatures rise [38]. Therefore, the birth rate is

 independent of the number of flies in the population. The death rate is seasonal because temperature also
affects adult fly survival [32]. Flies thrive at mean temperatures of 20–258C. Survival decreases above and
below this range [32].
In temperate climates, such as Ontario, most flies do not survive the cold winter temperatures [32].
In order to capture this, the model removes all flies above the initial fly population (w ¼ Sf0) at the
end of each warm season. Therefore, the model restarts every year with the same number of
susceptible flies and zero ‘contaminated’ flies. Susceptible flies become ‘contaminated’ when they
contact the environmental reservoir (bb). The flies pick up bacteria on their bristles. When they land
on human food, they leave the bacteria behind. These bacteria can then infect a susceptible human
when the food is consumed (bf). It is assumed that the contaminated flies remain contaminated until
they die. This dynamic disease transmission process is represented by equations (A 1)–(A 7) in
appendix A.
2.3. Model assumptions
The model assumed homogeneous mixing between the entire human population of Ontario, Canada.
The model assumed that humans acquire lifelong immunity to Campylobacter after they have recovered
from an infection. Waning immunity was added to the model and had minimal effect on the model
outcomes and therefore was removed for simplicity. Owing to the low case fatality rate [39], the
model also assumed that there was no difference in death rates for those who had been infected and
those who were uninfected.
Many of the assumptions revolve around flies and their contact. There are few empirical data on fly
contact rates with both humans and the environment. Therefore, these parameters were estimated
through model fitting.
2.4. Model fitting and validation
Owing to the number of unknown parameters, the model was fit to existing data in order to estimate
these parameters. This was done by fitting the model’s unknown parameters to the first year of the
PHO dataset (1 January to 31 December 2005) using R’s optimizing function. This is an optimization
technique based on Nelder–Mead, quasi-Newton and conjugate-gradient algorithms for general
purpose [40]. Initial parameter estimates were defined along with upper and lower bounds using the
‘L-BFGS-B’ method. Model fit was determined graphically by visually comparing the model output to
the observed daily incidence data.
The model was validated using two techniques. First, the model was run for the remaining duration
of the dataset (2006–2013). The predicted daily incidence was compared to the observed PHO incidence
from 1 January 2006 until 31 December 2013. This appeared to be a good fit graphically and, therefore, a
second validation step was done to ensure the model outputs were accurate. Using the model-predicted
cumulative incidence from 1 January 2005 to 31 December 2017, the cumulative incidence was compared
to incidence reported in the ‘Monthly Infectious Disease Surveillance Report’ by PHO, with 15% of the
cases removed to account for the proportion of cases that were assumed to have acquired the bacteria
through international travel [1,39].

 2.5. Sensitivity analysis
A Latin hypercube sensitivity analysis was performed on all parameters in the model with results
depicted as partial rank correlation coefficients. A univariate sensitivity analysis was performed on
the initial conditions that had uncertainty or that were estimated through model fitting.
2.6. Climate change conditions
As the global temperature rises, the population dynamics of flies, as with many other vectors, are sure to
change [18,19]. In order to capture expected changes in fly population size, we used population
predictions from Goulson et al. [18] under moderate and high carbon emission scenarios. Under a
medium–low emission scenario, the authors predicted a 45.7% increase by 2020, an 84.3% increase by
2050 and a 156% increase by 2080 of annual fly population size compared to baseline population size
estimates from 2003 [18]. Under a high emission scenario, the authors predicted a 45.7%, 128% and 244%
increase in annual fly population size [18]. This dynamic was captured in the model by changing the birth
and death rate of the flies as well as increasing the number of flies that survive over the winter (table 3).
The amount of fly activity also increases as temperatures increase and, therefore, is likely to increase under
the warming temperatures associated with climate change [19]. This is of concern because as flies become
more active, they may have more contact with the contaminated reservoir where they can pick up
pathogens on their bodies. Therefore, this increased activity could also lead to more flies landing on our
foods. An increase in fly activity was modelled by increasing the amount the flies contact the environment
(be) and the amount the flies contact human food (bf). We modelled this as a 25–100% increase in fly
activity (table 3). These scenarios were also examined in combination (fly population�fly activity level) to
determine the expected observed increase in human incidence of disease in these different scenarios. All
scenarios were compared to the first year of the baseline scenario (1 January–31 December 2005). This year
was chosen for comparison as the predictions by Goulson et al. [18] were compared to 2003 fly populations
and the surveillance data show relatively stable incidence over the given time period.

 table 4), the model graphically appeared to have a good fit to the observed Campylobacter incidence in
Ontario from 1 January to 31 December 2005 (figure 2), meaning that it found the minimal difference
and best fit statistically. Since parameters were estimated using the first year of the data and appeared
to have a good fit, the model was run for the next 8 years (the full duration of the dataset) using the

appeared to have a good fit (figure 4).
3.2. Sensitivity analysis
From the Latin hypercube sensitivity analysis, the model was most sensitive to the latent period (l), the
environmental parameter (z) and the fly death rate (md) as seen by the high partial rank correlation
coefficients in figure 5. The model was moderately sensitive to the transmission parameters including
flies and the environmental reservoir (bf, be, bb), but not to the person-to-person transmission rate (bi).
From the univariate analysis, it was found that the model was least sensitive to the initial number of
susceptible flies (Sf0), and the upper bound of initial susceptible humans (Sh0) (electronic supplementary
material, table S1A). The model was highly sensitive to the initial environmental load (B0) and the lower

 bound of the initial susceptible humans (Sh0) (electronic supplementary material, table S1A). Therefore, it
is necessary to have enough susceptible humans and enough bacterial load in the environment in order
to initiate the spread of campylobacteriosis, until a certain threshold of susceptible humans is reached, in
which case it can no longer spread to a greater extent. However, if there are more bacteria in the
environment, this can lead to much greater outbreaks.
3.3. Climate change scenarios
Using the predictions of Goulson et al. [18], under medium–low emission scenarios, which correspond to
a 156% increase in fly population size, the model showed that there could be a 6.67% increase in
campylobacteriosis incidence by 2080 [18]. Under high emission scenarios which correspond to a
244% increase in fly population size, the model showed a 10.35% increase in incidence (figure 6;
electronic supplementary material, table S2A).
When there was a 25% increase in fly activity, the model exhibited a 23.43% increase in human
Campylobacter incidence. When fly activity was doubled, the model predicted a 93.73% increase in

material, table S2A).
More realistically, both phenomenon will occur under climate change scenarios. Therefore, we
examined combinations in which all predicted population increases were run under the 25–100%
activity increase scenarios. In this case, under medium–low carbon emissions, the model projected a
31.74% increase in incidence by 2080 if fly activity increased by 25% but up to a 107.02% increase if fly
activity doubled. Under worst-case scenarios (high carbon emissions causing 244% population increase
and 100% activity increase), the model projected a 114.43% increase in Campylobacter incidence in
Ontario compared to the 2005 baseline (figure 8; electronic supplementary material, table S2A).
4. Discussion
Using a novel model structure, we have identified the environmental conditions that appear to describe the
observed incidence of campylobacteriosis in Ontario. In addition, we have identified how the incidence of
campylobacteriosis in the Ontario human population could change under different climate change

 scenarios that act to change fly populations and activity levels. This is an important step towards identifying
evidence in support of this hypothesis which may lead to more research in this area.
4.1. Model results
According to our model results, increased fly activity is more influential in increasing the human incidence of
campylobacteriosis compared to increased overall fly population size. For example, a 50% increase in fly
activity resulted in a 46.9% increase in the incidence of campylobacteriosis; however, a 45.6% increase in
fly population size resulted in a 1.9% increase in Campylobacter incidence. In the worst-case scenario, our
fly population model predicted a 10.3% increase in disease incidence. This pattern has been noticed in
other mathematical models of vector-borne diseases. For example, in a model of mosquito transmission in
Africa that included seasonality, the authors found that insecticide-treated nets were more effective at
controlling the spread of disease when compared with indoor residual spraying [41]. In this case, the nets
are controlling the ability of mosquitoes to enter the homes and therefore are limiting contact with
humans, whereas the spraying is controlling the size of the mosquito population. This has major
implications for public health and, therefore, gives us insight into potential areas for intervention and
control. For example, common practice for fly control includes spraying to reduce fly population size.

 However, according to our model, small populations that are highly active still contribute significantly to
transmission. Controlling fly activity or decreasing the transmission rate between flies and human
food may be more beneficial in this case. Intervention studies have been performed in which fly
screens were used to prevent the entrance of flies into poultry barns [42]. For example, there was a
reduction in C. jejuni prevalence in poultry barns in Denmark from 41 to 10% in those that had fly screens
[42]. These interventions appear to be successful at the flock level and may provide insight into future
intervention strategies.
4.2. Limitations
Modelling Campylobacter transmission is difficult because of its complex dynamics. As a result, this
model makes a number of assumptions and simplifications. For example, the homogeneous mixing
assumption assumes that every individual has the same probability of contact with the environment,
each other and the flies [43]. In reality, this may not be the case. For example, with many enteric
diseases, there are high rates of transmission within households, but little transmission between other
infected individuals [44]. Certain individuals may also have more contact with the environment or
certain components of the environmental reservoir or may be more at risk for contact with flies, such
as those living in rural areas or on farms. This model may under- or overestimate the incidence
depending on the importance of the heterogeneity of the population. Therefore, other model
structures may be required to overcome this assumption such as models stratified by age, living
conditions or level of risk.
This model was calibrated and validated using human incidence only and therefore does not use
independent data for the fly or environment reservoirs. Since empirical data for these reservoirs do
not exist at this scale, these values were obtained through model fitting and could not be
independently validated. This is an important limitation of the model and suggests that the collection
of additional data for further model validation would be a useful next step.
Our model-predicted incidence aligns well with the years of observed data but does diverge after
2013 and predicts higher incidence for the subsequent 4 years. This may be an indication that our
model may overestimate the burden of campylobacteriosis when run further into the future.
This model was created to explore if flies as a mechanical vector for disease transmission to humans
was a viable hypothesis. There were no data on fly population dynamics and contact rates with both
humans and the environment in Ontario, and therefore, these parameters were estimated through
model fitting. The model was also sensitive to the transmission rates involving flies (bf and be). These
parameters are influential because they determine the rate at which susceptible humans are becoming
infected and, therefore, are big drivers of the disease dynamics. These parameters were also found
through parametrization. Therefore, this model would benefit from further research into collecting
empirical data to obtain more informative upper and lower bounds on these parameters to create
more accurate and informative models.
Our results showed that increasing the amount of fly activity leads to a greater increase in incidence
and, therefore, controlling fly contact may be a superior method of prevention than controlling fly
population size. However, this may be a combination of the way in which we modelled increases to
fly activity and the uncertainty around the amount fly activity will increase in the future. Increasing
fly activity in our model involved increasing both the transmission parameter with humans (bf) and
the environment (be) by the intended percentage increase (i.e. a 25% increase in activity resulted in a
25% increase in bf and a 25% increase in be). This could have, however, been modelled as a
synergistic effect by increasing each transmission parameter by 12.5% to create a total increase of 25%.
Further research in this area is warranted.
An aspect of the biology that we did not address is that the retention of Campylobacter on flies
may decline as temperatures increase [45]. This could be an important factor in how far flies can
carry Campylobacter depending on the temperature. This could be tested in the future using our
model in conjunction with projected fly population and activity changes under the different climate
change scenarios.
Our model used predictions from Goulson et al. on climate change’s effect on fly population size
based on the assumption from the UK Climate Impacts Programme that the global temperature will
increase by 2.348C by 2080 in an optimistic medium–low carbon emission scenario and by 3.888C in a
high emission scenario [18,46]. Should the magnitude of climate change vary in North America, it
would be expected that fly populations and activity would also vary accordingly.

 5. Conclusion
A mechanistic infectious disease model for the transmission of Campylobacter in the Ontario human
population in which flies act as a mechanical vector between contaminated environments and human
food consumption was created. The model was able to capture the observed daily and cumulative
incidence data, thus supporting the fly transmission hypothesis. Creating a model for Campylobacter
which includes a seasonally fluctuating environmental compartment and fly populations will allow
future researchers to test many different aspects of the transmission chain. This could include
expanding the model to explicitly model specific transmission routes as well as test different
prevention and control strategies.
