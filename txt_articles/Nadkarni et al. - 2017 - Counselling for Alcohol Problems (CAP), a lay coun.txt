Summary
Background Although structured psychological treatments are recommended as fi
 rst-line interventions for harmful 
drinking, only a small fraction of people globally receive these treatments because of poor access in routine primary care. 
We assessed the eff
 ectiveness and cost-eff
 ectiveness of Counselling for Alcohol Problems (CAP), a brief psychological 
treatment delivered by lay counsellors to patients with harmful drinking attending routine primary health-care settings.
Methods In this randomised controlled trial, we recruited male harmful drinkers defi
 ned by an Alcohol Use Disorders 
Identifi
 cation Test (AUDIT) score of 12–19 who were aged 18–65 years from ten primary health centres in Goa, India. We 
excluded patients who needed emergency medical treatment or inpatient admission, who were unable to communicate 
clearly, and who were intoxicated at the time of screening. Participants were randomly allocated (1:1) by trained health 
assistants based at the primary health centres to enhanced usual care (EUC) alone or EUC combined with CAP, in 
randomly sized blocks of four to six, stratifi
 ed by primary health centre, and allocation was concealed with use of sequential 
numbered opaque envelopes. Physicians providing EUC and those assessing outcomes were masked. Primary outcomes 
were remission (AUDIT score of <8) and mean daily alcohol consumed in the past 14 days, at 3 months. Secondary 
outcomes were the eff
 ect of drinking, disability score, days unable to work, suicide attempts, intimate partner violence, 
and resource use and costs of illness. Analyses were on an intention-to-treat basis. We used logistic regression analysis for 
remission and zero-infl
 ated negative binomial regression analysis for alcohol consumption. We assessed serious adverse 
events in the per-protocol population. This trial is registered with the ISCRTN registry, number ISRCTN76465238. 
Findings Between Oct 28, 2013, and July 29, 2015, we enrolled and randomly allocated 377 participants (188 [50%] to the 
EUC plus CAP group and 190 [50%] to the EUC alone group [one of whom was subsequently excluded because of a 
protocol violation]), of whom 336 (89%) completed the 3 month primary outcome assessment (164 [87%] in the EUC 
plus CAP group and 172 [91%] in the EUC alone group). The proportion with remission (59 [36%] of 164 in the EUC plus 
CAP group vs 44 [26%] of 172 in the EUC alone group; adjusted prevalence ratio 1·50 [95% CI 1·09–2·07]; p=0·01) and 
the proportion abstinent in the past 14 days (68 [42%] vs 31 [18%]; adjusted odds ratio 3·00 [1·76–5·13]; p<0·0001) were 
signifi
 cantly higher in the EUC plus CAP group than in the EUC alone group, but we noted no eff
 ect on mean daily 
alcohol consumed in the past 14 days among those who reported drinking in this period (37·0 g [SD 44·2] vs 31·0 g [27·8]; 
count ratio 1·08 [0·79–1·49]; p=0·62). We noted an eff
 ect on the percentage of days abstinent in the past 14 days (adjusted 
mean diff
 erence [AMD] 16·0% [8·1–24·1]; p<0·0001), but no eff
 ect on the percentage of days of heavy drinking 
(AMD –0·4% [–5·7 to 4·9]; p=0·88), the eff
 ect of drinking (Short Inventory of Problems score AMD–0·03 [–1·93 to 1·86]; 
p=0.97), disability score (WHO Disability Assessment Schedule score AMD 0·62 [–0·62 to 1·87]; p=0·32), days unable to 
work (no days unable to work adjusted odds ratio 1·02 [0·61–1·69]; p=0.95), suicide attempts (adjusted prevalence 
ratio 1·8 [–2·4 to 6·0]; p=0·25), and intimate partner violence (adjusted prevalence ratio 3·0 [–10·4 to 4·4]; p=0·57). The 
incremental cost per additional remission was $217 (95% CI 50–1073), with an 85% chance of being cost-eff
 ective in the 
study setting. We noted no signifi
 cant diff
 erence in the number of serious adverse events between the two groups 
(six [4%] in the EUC plus CAP group vs 13 [8%] in the EUC alone group; p=0·11). 
Interpretation CAP delivered by lay counsellors plus EUC was better than EUC alone was for harmful drinkers in 
routine primary health-care settings, and might be cost-eff
 ective. CAP could be a key strategy to reduce the treatment 
gap for alcohol use disorders, one of the leading causes of the global burden among men worldwide.

premature mortality, accounting for 7·9% (95% CI 6–10) 
of years lost to disability and 44·4% (29·1–60·0) of years 
of life lost because of all mental and substance use 
disorders.2 Among men in middle-income countries, 
alcohol use disorders are the leading neuropsychiatric 
cause of disease burden.3 In India, alcohol-attributable 
mortality and prevalence of alcohol use disorders relative 
to the per-person volume of alcohol consumed are high.1
Hazardous (a quantity or pattern of alcohol con-
sumption that places individuals at risk of physical or 
psychological harm) and harmful (a quantity or pattern 
of alcohol consumption that has resulted in physical or 
psychological harm) drinking4 aff
 ect more people than 
does dependent drinking5 (a quantity or pattern of alcohol 
consumption characterised by craving, tolerance, a 
preoccupation with alcohol, and continued drinking 
despite harmful consequences),6 but the policy response 
to the growing public health problem of alcohol use 
disorders in low-income and middle-income countries 
remains focused on dependent drinking.5
Various psychosocial interventions are available for 
treatment of alcohol use disorders and can be broadly 
summarised as follows. Brief interventions are short, 
typically a single session lasting up to 15 min, focused on 
psychosocial interventions designed to address alcohol-
related problems or reduce heavy drinking in hazardous 
drinkers.7 Severe alcohol problems, such as harmful 
drinking, require specialised brief or extended therapies 
(eg, behavioural therapy, motivational enhancement 
therapy, or Twelve Step Facilitation).8 Although brief 
psychological interventions are recommended for harmful 
drinking by the recent Disease Control Priorities Project9 
(a project aimed at compilation and dis 
semination of the 
most up-to-date evidence for cost-eff
 ective interventions 
and their delivery for the leading causes of global disease 
burden), most people in low-income and middle-income 
countries, including India, lack access to such inter-
ventions because of the absence of skilled human 
resources10 and concerns regarding the contextual 
appropriate 
 
ness and generalisability of inter 
ventions 
developed in high-income cultural settings.11,12 These 
barriers could be addressed by development and testing of 
interventions that have been matched to the context in 
which they will be off
 ered and delivery of them via non-
specialist health workers (NSHWs) or counsellors.13
PREMIUM (Program for Eff
 ective Mental Health 
Interventions in Under-Resourced Health Systems) is a 
research programme whose goal was to design methods 
for development and assessment of scalable psychological 
treatments that are culturally appropriate, aff
 ordable, and 
feasible for delivery by NSHWs and to apply these 
methods14 to depression (the Healthy Activity Program 
[HAP])15 and harmful drinking (Counselling for Alcohol 
Problems [CAP]).16 In this Article, we describe the results 
of a trial assessing the eff
 ectiveness and cost-eff
 ectiveness 
of the CAP treatment when used in primary care. The 
study of HAP treatment is reported separately.17 The two 
trials of HAP and CAP were done concurrently in the 
same primary health centres (PHCs) and over the same 
period of time, with the same counsellors delivering both 
treatments according to the trial allocations of participants.
Methods
Study design and participants
In this randomised controlled trial, we recruited 
participants from PHCs in Goa, India. Of the 14 PHCs in 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
We updated WHO’s Mental Health Gap Action Programme 
systematic review with our own systematic review. We searched 
the PubMed, PsycINFO, and IndMed databases from Jan 1, 1990, 
to Jan 1, 2011, for English language publications using the 
following search terms: “alcohol”, “drinking”, “addiction”, 
“psychological”, “therapy”, “counselling”, and “treatment”. Brief 
psychological treatments based on motivational enhancement 
have been shown to be eff
 ective for management of harmful 
drinking and are recommended as fi
 rst-line interventions by 
WHO’s Mental Health Gap Action Programme for delivery in 
routine health-care settings. However, the existing evidence has 
low generalisability to many low-income and middle-income 
countries where both supply side barriers (low availability of 
mental health professionals) and demand side barriers (low levels 
of mental health literacy) lead to large treatment gaps.
Added value of this study
This study reports the fi
 rst fi
 ndings from any low-income and 
middle-income country assessing the eff
 ectiveness and 
cost-eff
 ectiveness of a brief psychological treatment for harmful 
drinking, delivered by lay counsellors in primary care. The brief (up 
to four-session) psychological treatment (Counselling for Alcohol 
Problems), based on motivational enhancement, with additional 
behavioural and cognitive elements, was better than was 
enhanced usual care according to all prespecifi
 ed primary clinical 
outcomes, except for mean daily alcohol consumed in the past 
14 days among those who reported drinking in this period, but no 
eff
 ect occurred on social and functional outcomes. The treatment 
was readily accepted by this previously untreated population and 
was highly likely to be cost-eff
 ective in this setting.
Implications of all the available evidence
Brief psychological treatments for harmful drinking, based on 
motivational enhancement, are acceptable, feasible, and 
cost-eff
 ective, even when delivered by non-specialist health 
workers in routine health-care settings in previously untreated 
populations. Such treatments should be scaled up as one of the 
key strategies to address the large and rising global burden of 
alcohol use disorders.

the north district of Goa, the Directorate of Health 
Services gave permission for PREMIUM to operate in 
ten. We started screening in eight, but during the course 
of the trial, two of these PHCs were replaced as one had 
low attendance and the other had a large proportion of 
migrant labourers. So at any given time, screening was 
only happening in eight PHCs. The publicly funded 
PHCs are the fi
 rst option for people seeking health care 
in the public system in India. The population served 
generally belongs to low socioeconomic groups.
Participants were 18–65-year-old men (women were not 
eligible as prevalence of any drinking in women in India 
is low, at 1%18) who were likely to be harmful drinkers, 
defi
 ned as scoring 12–19 on the Alcohol Use Disorders 
Identifi
 cation Test (AUDIT).19 We also included harmful 
drinkers who screened positive for depression according 
to the Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9) in this 
trial; we off
 ered HAP treatment to those who continued 
to screen positive for depression at the end of CAP 
treatment. Although we did off
 er people with alcohol 
dependence (ie, those who scored higher than 20) the 
opportunity to participate in the trial, this action was 
taken primarily to enhance the acceptability of the 
programme in the PHCs; as the trial was not powered for 
outcomes in this opportunistically identifi
 ed group, the 
fi
 ndings are not reported here. We excluded from 
screening patients who needed emergency medical 
treatment or inpatient admission, who were unable to 
communicate clearly, and who were intoxicated at the 
time of screening.
The trial protocol20 was approved by the Trial Steering 
Committee, and ethical approval for the conduct of the 
trial was obtained from the Institutional Review Boards 
of the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, 
Sangath (the imple 
menting institution in India), and the 
Indian Council of Medical Research. Written (or 
witnessed, if the participant is illiterate) informed 
consent was mandatory for enrolment. We audiotaped all 
consent procedures, with patients’ approvals.
Randomisation and masking
A randomisation list in randomly sized blocks (four to six), 
stratifi
 ed by PHC, was generated by a statistician 
independent of the trial. The randomisation code was 
concealed and allocated by trained health assistants based 
at the primary health centres at the individual level after 
completion of the baseline assessments using sequential 
numbered opaque sealed envelopes.21 Physicians providing 
enhanced usual care (EUC) were masked to allocation 
status, as were the independent assessors who did the 
outcome assessments, and these people had no contact 
with the PHCs or other team members. All authors, apart 
from the data manager (BB), were masked until the trial 
results were unmasked. Instances of unmasking of 
outcome assessors in the CAP group will be summarised 
on the basis of overall prevalence and the exact point 
during the interview that the interviewer was unmasked.
Procedures
Trained health assistants, independent of the counsellors, 
screened patients using AUDIT and administered a 
baseline questionnaire to trial participants to collect 
sociodemographic information (eg age and marital 
status) and data for potential moderators of treatment 
eff
 ect. We audiotaped all outcome interviews (with 
permission), and the tapes were randomly selected 
(using a random selection strategy stratifi
 ed by outcome 
assessor) for review by the supervisor for quality 
assurance.
In the EUC group, usual care (consultation with the 
PHC physician) was enhanced by provision of the 
screening results to the PHC physician and provision of a 
contextualised version of the WHO Mental Health Gap 
Action Programme guidelines22 for harmful drinking, 
including when and where to refer patients for specialist 
care. In the CAP group, participants received EUC plus 
CAP. CAP is a manualised psychological treatment 
delivered in three phases over a maximum of four sessions 
(each lasting approximately 30–45 min) at weekly to 
fortnightly intervals.15 The initial phase involves detailed 
assessment followed by personalised feedback; the middle 
phase involves helping the patient to develop cognitive and 
behavioural skills and techniques, consisting of drink 
refusal skills, handling of peer pressure, problem-solving 
skills, and handling of diffi
  cult emotions; and the ending 
phase involves the patient learning how to manage 
potential or actual relapses using the skills acquired in the 
middle phase.
The stance adopted by the counsellor is that of 
motivational interviewing23 and client-centred general 
counselling strategies (eg, open-ended questioning and 
showing of empathy). The general counselling and 
problem-solving strategies were shared between CAP 
and HAP treatments. We typically conducted sessions 
face-to-face, at the PHC or patient’s home, but used 
telephone sessions when necessary. We considered 
patients who missed three consecutive scheduled 
sessions to have dropped out of treatment. Counsellors 
were adults with no professional training or qualifi
 cation 
in the fi
 eld of mental health, they had completed at least 
secondary school education, and they were fl
 uent in the 
vernacular languages used in the study settings. The 
selection process began with interviews involving 
roleplays for applicants for the training; for those who 
cleared this step, the process continued with intensive 
2 week classroom training in both CAP and HAP 
treatments, followed by a competency assessment; for 
those who graduated this step, the process continued 
with a 6 month internship with supervision of cases by 
experts; and fi
 nally, selection occurred through testing of 
knowledge (multiple choice question exam) and skills 
(roleplays with use of standardised vignettes and quality 
ratings of actual CAP sessions delivered). 11 counsellors 
participated in the trial. They received weekly peer-led 
supervision in groups of four to six, which involved

rating of a randomly selected (using a random selection 
strategy stratifi
 ed by counsellor and phase of session) 
10% of recorded sessions on the CAP Therapy Quality 
Scale (TQS)24 and individual supervision twice monthly. 
We used information about contact with the counsellor 
to estimate CAP delivery costs, which took into account 
training, supervision, and salary costs.
We assessed treatment fi
 delity via treatment completion, 
maintained by counsellors in their clinical records, CAP 
TQS scores from peer and expert ratings of audio 
recordings of sessions during weekly group supervision,24 
and therapy quality of a random selection (using a random 
selection strategy stratifi
 ed by counsellor and phase of 
session) of 10% of all sessions by an expert involved in the 
development of CAP.
Outcomes
Primary outcomes were remission defi
 ned as an AUDIT 
score of less than 8 and mean daily alcohol consumption 
in the past 14 days immediately preceding the 3 month 
outcome assessment. We measured the primary 
outcomes 3 months after enrolment. Secondary outcomes 
were the Short Inventory of Problems (SIP) mean score, 
WHO Disability Assessment Schedule (WHODAS) II 
mean disability score, total days unable to work in the 
previous month, a suicide attempt in the past 3 months, 
perpetration of intimate partner violence (“In the past 
3 months, have you slapped, hit, kicked, punched your 
wife/partner or done something else that did or could 
have hurt her physically?”), and resource use and costs of 
illness estimated from the Client Service Receipt 
Inventory.25 SIP mean score was prespecifi
 ed as a primary 
outcome in the protocol; however, in a joint meeting of 
the Trial Steering Committee and Data Monitoring and 
Safety Committee before unmasking, SIP mean score 
was changed to a secondary outcome to reduce 
multiplicity of the primary outcomes. Two additional 
secondary 
outcomes 
that 
were 
not 
prespecifi
 ed 
(percentage of days abstinent and percentage of days of 
heavy drinking generated from the Timeline Followback) 
were also added to bring the trial in line with 
recommendations of the National Institute on Alcohol 
Abuse and Alcoholism.26 We did outcome assessment 
between Jan 29, 2014, and Nov 30, 2015. We collected data 
for serious adverse events, defi
 ned as deaths, suicide 
attempts, and unplanned admissions to hospital from 
any cause.
Statistical analysis
Based on the assumptions of participants being randomly 
allocated within each of the clinics, of there being one 
counsellor per PHC at any one time, of an intracluster 
correlation of 0·04, of a loss to follow-up of 15% over 
3 months, and of a 1:1 allocation ratio, a trial size 
of 400 enrolled participants with harmful drinking had 
90% power to detect the hypothesised eff
 ects (eff
 ect size 
of 0·45 for mean standard ethanol content consumed; 
remissions of 68% vs 40% in favour of CAP) for the primary 
outcomes, with a 5% type I error. In estimating the sample 
size, we considered both primary outcomes, and the study 
was adequately powered to assess each of these outcomes 
independently. For the binary primary outcome of 
remission, we had a 99% power to detect a remission 
of 68% in the EUC plus CAP group versus 40% in the EUC 
alone group, and for the con 
tinuous primary outcome of 
daily alcohol consumption, we had a 93% power to detect 
an eff
 ect size of 0·45.
Analyses were on an intention-to-treat basis, with 
multiple imputation for missing outcome data assuming 
data were missing at random, assuming predictive mean 
matching for positively skewed outcomes. We assessed 
serious adverse events in the per-protocol population. We 
estimated the primary continuous outcome (mean daily 
ethanol consumed in the past 14 days) by multiplying the 
total standard drinks27 consumed in the past 14 days by 10

 nition of a standard drink as 10 g

of pure ethanol28). We used zero-infl
 ated negative binomial 
regression29 to estimate the intervention eff
 ect for this 
outcome and other positively skewed overdispersed 
outcomes with an excess of zeros. We analysed continuous 
outcomes with normally distributed residuals using linear 
regression. We analysed binary outcomes using logistic 
regression.
We adjusted all models for both PHC as a fi
 xed eff
 ect to 
allow for within-PHC clustering and for baseline AUDIT 
score. As only ten PHCs were included in the study, we 
decided to adjust for these PHCs as fi
 xed eff
 ects, as 
recommended by Kahan30 for studies with a small 
number of centres. However, we did a sensitivity analysis 
using random-eff
 ects models to adjust for within-PHC 
clustering. Additionally, we did a post-hoc analysis 
allowing for clustered errors using the cluster option in 
Stata. For outcomes analysed with use of zero-infl
 ated 
negative binomial regression, the intervention eff
 ect is 
estimated for all participants in one model as an adjusted 
odds ratio with a 95% CI for the proportion with zero 
(ie, no reported drinking) and an adjusted count ratio 
with a 95% CI among those with non-zero responses. For 
other continuous outcomes, we reported the intervention 
eff
 ect as the adjusted mean diff
 erence with a 95% CI. For 
binary outcomes, we reported the intervention eff
 ect as 
the adjusted prevalence ratio and adjusted prevalence 
diff
 erence, estimated using the marginal standardisation 
technique with a 95% CI for the prevalence ratios 
estimated using the δ method.31 We assessed moderators 
of treatment eff
 ect for a-priori-defi
 ned moderators, 
namely baseline severity of drinking, readiness to 
change, and expectations of the usefulness of counselling. 
Sensitivity analyses for linear and logistic regression 
models were adjustment for counsellor as a random 
eff
 ect, and complete case analysis. We describe results in 
terms of the strength of evidence rather than statistical 
signifi
 cance,32 and the consistency of results for related 
outcomes are examined to interpret fi
 ndings.
We did economic assessments (comparative analysis of 
costs and outcomes between EUC plus CAP and EUC 
alone groups) from the health-care system and societal 
viewpoints. We estimated the costs of CAP by attaching 
appropriate local Indian unit costs to each resource 
required to deliver each component of the intervention, 
including training, supervision, travel, and materials. We 
also collected detailed information about total counsellor 
time for all attempted and completed contacts, including 
travel time, valued using actual counsellor salaries. We 
used the Client Service Receipt Inventory to record 
participants’ subsequent contacts with health services, 
including hospital inpatient and outpatient contacts, and 
also to document any patient-borne or family-borne 
costs, including time out of their usual occupation. We 
valued time out of usual occupation for patients and their 
families using relevant published mean wages.
We compared changes in principal outcomes with 
changes in costs to calculate Incremental Cost 
Eff
 ective 
ness Ratios (ICERs). We calculated cost per 
additional remission or non-drinker achieved and 
quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. We compared 
diff
 erences in mean costs using standard parametric 
tests. We derived QALY scores through transformation of 
WHODAS II 12 item scores.33 We imputed missing 
values for QALYs and cost data and bootstrapped ICERs 
to derive 95% CIs. We explored statistical uncertainty 
around the ICERs through cost-eff
 ectiveness acceptability 
curves showing the likelihood that CAP would be cost-
eff
 ective at diff
 erent levels of willingness-to-pay 
thresholds. All costs are presented in 2015 international 
dollars. We did statistical analyses using Stata version 14.1. 
A Data and Safety Monitoring Committee oversaw the 
trial. This trial is registered with the ISCRTN registry, 
number ISRCTN76465238.

Results
Between Oct 28, 2013, and July 29, 2015, we assessed 
73 887 PHC attenders for eligibility (fi
 gure 1). Of these, 
16 007 (22%) were eligible for screening and 14 773 (92%) 
of these were screened with AUDIT. Of these, 679 (5%) 
screened positive as harmful drinkers and 378 (56%) of 
these consented to participate and were enrolled and 
randomly allocated (188 [50%] to the EUC plus CAP 
group and 190 [50%] to the EUC alone group, one of 
whom was subsequently excluded from the EUC alone 
group because he was erroneously enrolled in both CAP 
and HAP trials, leaving a total of 189 patients in the EUC 
alone group). The leading reasons for ineligibility for 
screening included age younger than 18 years or older 
than 65 years (23 453 [41%] of 57 880), already having 
been screened within the last 3 months (10 046 [17%]), 
not planning to be resident in the study area for the 
duration of the study (9835 [17%]), and being resident 
outside of the study catchment areas (6014 [10%]). The 
trial ended on Aug 30, 2016, when the 12 month outcome 
assessment ended.
Baseline characteristics were similar between groups 
(table 1). We noted no signifi
 cant diff
 erence in age 
between participants and those who declined participation 
(mean age 42·0 years [SD 11·4] vs 40·5 years [11·7]; 
p=0·09), with a higher AUDIT (median AUDIT score 14 
[IQR 13–16] vs 14 [13–16]; p=0·04) and PHQ-9 (median 
PHQ-9 score 4 [IQR 1–8] vs 3 [1–6]; p<0·0001) score. 
Participation by PHC varied signifi
 cantly (p=0·001), with 
higher parti 
cipation in some PHCs (>60%) rather than 
others (<60%; appendix). Of the 377 participants, 336 
(89%) were seen at the primary endpoint of 3 months (164 
[44%] in the EUC plus CAP group and 172 [46%] in the 
EUC alone group), a fi
 gure similar to the number 
predicted for the sample size estimation. Participants 
who were lost to follow-up tended to be younger than 
were those not lost to follow-up (appendix). Reasons for 
loss to follow-up were inability to track down the 
participant (26 [63%] of 41; 16 [39%] in the EUC plus CAP 
group vs ten [24%] in the EUC alone group), refusal (12 
[29%]; eight [20%] vs four [10%]), and death (three [7%] in 
the EUC alone group). We imputed outcome data for 
these 41 participants lost to follow-up.
The proportion with remission according to AUDIT 
was signifi
 cantly higher in the EUC plus CAP group than 
in the EUC alone group (59 [36%] of 164 scoring less 
than 8 on AUDIT in the EUC plus CAP group vs 44 [26%] 
of 172 in the EUC alone group; adjusted prevalence ratio 
1·50 [95% CI 1·09–2·07]; p=0·01; adjusted prevalence 
diff
 erence 12·6% [5·9–27·1]; table 2). Analysis of daily 
ethanol consumption showed a signifi
 cantly higher 
proportion of participants reporting no alcohol con-
sumption in the past 14 days in the EUC plus CAP group 
than in the EUC alone group (68 [41%] in the EUC plus 
CAP group vs 31 [18%] in the EUC alone group; adjusted 
odds ratio 3·00 [95% CI 1·76–5·13]; p<0·0001) and no 
diff
 erence in consumption among those who reported 
any drinking in this period (37·0 g [SD 44·2] vs 31·0 g 
[27·8]; count ratio 1·08 [95% CI 0·79–1·49]; p=0·62).
We noted no evidence of an intervention eff
 ect on SIP 
score, WHODAS II score, days unable to work, suicide 
attempts, perpetration of intimate partner violence, and 
percentage of days of heavy drinking. We did note a 
signifi
 cant intervention eff
 ect on the per 
centage of days 
abstinent in the past 14 days. We noted no evidence of 
eff
 ect modifi
 cation by baseline AUDIT score (fi
 gure 2) or 
expectations of the usefulness of counselling (appendix). 
However, we found evidence of a greater intervention 
eff
 ect among those not already trying to change drinking 
behaviour at baseline for ethanol consumption (p=0·003) 
than among those already trying. Results were similar 
when adjusted for counsellor as a random eff
 ect, when 
using complete case analyses, and when allowing for 
clustered errors. We noted no signifi
 cant diff
 erences in 
the number of serious adverse events between the two 
groups (any serious adverse event six [4%] in the EUC plus 
CAP group vs 13 [8%] in the EUC alone group, p=0·11;

[4%] vs seven [4%], p=1·00; appendix).
The intraclass correlation for ethanol consumption at 
3 months within PHCs was 0·04, as predicted. Of the 
188 participants in the EUC plus CAP group, 131 (70%) 
had a planned discharge and none were referred for 
specialist care. The mean number of sessions for those 
who had a planned discharge was 2·8 (95% CI 2·7–3·0), 
whereas those who had an unplanned discharge were 
most likely to drop out after the fi
 rst session (mean 
number of sessions 1·1 [95% CI 1·0–1·3]). Of the total of 
434 sessions delivered, 425 (98%) were delivered in face-
to-face format; 84 (33%) of 257 sessions from the second 
session onwards were delivered at home, and 42 (22%) of 
participants in the EUC plus CAP group had a signifi
 cant 
other involved in at least one session. The mean duration 
of sessions was 42·4 min (40·9–43·7). Mean TQS score 
on the basis of peer supervisor ratings (n=183) was 2·35 
(2·29–2·41), similar to expert supervisor ratings (n=183; 
mean 2·44 [2·36–2·51]) and the mean score of the 
independent rater for 10% of randomly selected sessions 
(n=40; mean 2·64 [2·42–2·87]), indicating adequate to 
good therapy quality. 13 (3%) of 377 investigators were 
unmasked, with eight (2%) unmasked before the primary 
outcome assessment.
From the health system perspective, the total health-
care cost per person—ie, including the intervention cost, 
was signifi
 cantly higher in the EUC plus CAP group 
than in the EUC alone group, with no signifi
 cant 
diff
 erence in QALY scores (table 3). Excluding 
intervention costs, we noted no signifi
 cant diff
 erences in 
aggregate health-care costs. Medication costs were 
signifi
 cantly lower in the EUC plus CAP group than in 
the EUC alone group. The incremental cost per 
additional remission from a health-care system 
perspective is shown in table 4; as fi
 gure 3 shows, if 
society is willing to pay up to the monthly minimum 
wage in Goa ($415)34 per individual in remission, CAP 
has an 85% chance of being cost-eff
 ective. Similarly, the 
cost per additional non-drinker was $124 (95% CI 
–$102 to $325), which would mean that CAP would have 
a more than 99% chance of being considered cost-
eff
 ective (appendix).
Discussion
This study provides evidence of the eff
 ectiveness of 
CAP, a brief psychological treatment for harmful 
drinking delivered by NSHWs in routine primary care 
settings. CAP was associated with strong eff
 ects on 
abstinence and remission 3 months after enrolment, 
but had no eff
 ect on other alcohol-related outcomes. 
The economic analysis indicates that CAP is likely to be 
cost-eff
 ective with regard to remission and non-drinking 
outcomes.
Although WHO recommends brief counselling for 
treatment of harmful drinkers,35 almost all evidence in 
support of these recommendations is from high-income 
settings.7 Our results add to the evidence base by showing 
that multisession brief interventions for harmful drinking 
in primary care attenders can be eff
 ective when delivered 
by well trained and supervised health workers without any

previous mental health training.36 Only two randomised 
controlled trials37,38 in low-income or middle-income 
countries have tested a NSHW-delivered treatment for any 
form of alcohol use disorder. However, both of these 
previous studies targeted hazardous or binge drinkers, 
and only one37 was based in primary care. Our study is the 
fi
 rst, to our knowledge, of such an intervention that has 
reported an economic assessment. The CAP treatment is 
a contextually appropriate intervention for harmful 
drinking developed specifi
 cally to be delivered by lay 
counsellors in primary care settings in low-income or 
middle-income countries, and this study provides 
evidence of eff
 ectiveness compared with EUC. When wide 
societal eff
 ects (eg, domestic violence and law enforcement 
costs) and savings for the family are considered, the 
economic case could perhaps be further strengthened. 
Although the economic argument might be a cause for 
action, it needs to be tested in future assessments.
As described above, brief interventions typically involve 
a brief conversation delivered to hazardous drinkers. For 
harmful drinkers, brief therapies focusing on specifi
 c 
behavioural change strategies, including provision of 
clients with skills to deal with alcohol-related problems, 
might be appropriate.39,40 The CAP treatment seeks to do 
just that. In India, various alcoholic beverages are 
consumed, 
consisting 
of 
commercial, 
licit 
non-
commercial, and illicit home-brewed alcoholic beverages.1 
The CAP treatment is designed around assessment, 
personalised feedback, and provision of skills needed to 
manage behaviours related to drinking, irrespective of 
the specifi
 c type of alcohol consumed. The pattern of 
outcomes suggests that CAP had eff
 ects on those who 
chose abstinence as a treatment goal, but did not have 
any eff
 ects on those who chose to continue drinking. 
This fi
 nding is consistent with the prevailing beliefs 
about the nature of alcohol problems in India, which 
place great importance on abstinence.41 The greater eff
 ect 
of CAP on those who were not already trying to make a 
change in their drinking behaviour compared with those 
who had already started to make a change indicates that 
the treatment enhanced motivation to change. This 
fi
 nding is consistent with the motivational enhancement 
theory on which CAP is based.42 CAP did not have any 
signifi
 cant eff
 ect on the adverse consequences of alcohol 
use disorder, as shown by the absence of signifi
 cant 
diff
 erences in any of the prespecifi
 ed secondary 
outcomes. One probable reason for this fi
 nding is that 
the severity of harmful drinking is not great enough to 
register on tools like SIP whose previous use has been 
primarily for people with dependent drinking, and 
consequently, any intervention targeting such drinking 
patterns does not result in observed changes with these 
tools. Finally, changes in outcomes like perpetration of 
domestic violence might possibly require specifi
 c 
strategies targeting these behaviours, and only targeting 
of drinking as a mediating mechanism might not be 
eff
 ective in reduction of domestic violence.
The study had several limitations. Reliance on self-
reported outcome data entails susceptibility to social 
desirability bias, and this factor might have varied by 
group.43 Reasons for under-reporting might have 
included 
the 
participant 
actually 
believing 
the 
information that they reported (self-deception) or so-
called faking good to conform to socially acceptable 
values, avoid criticism, or gain social approval. However, 
more objective measures such as biomarkers are 
insensitive to alcohol use disorder except for when it is 
severe, and alcohol treatment trials have not found 
advantages in use of collateral reports or other 
alternatives.44 Biomarkers might, in time, be developed 
for use in clinical trials, although at present the most 
promising ones available do not accurately and sensitively 
estimate levels of consumption.45 The results in our study 
are restricted to the primary outcomes at 3 months where 
our interest lies in the response and remission of 
participants with harmful drinking after our treatment. 
We intend to assess the sustainability of these outcomes, 
including recovery from harmful drinking, at a 12 month 
follow-up. No cost-eff
 ectiveness thresholds have been 
established for alcohol outcomes in India; we have 
conservatively assumed that this threshold is no more 
than the monthly wage for an unskilled worker. The 
absence of eff
 ect on QALYs might be viewed in the 
context of doubt about the capacity of standard measures 
such as those used in this study to capture improvements 
in alcohol-related quality of life.46 A delayed eff
 ect of 
reduced drinking or abstinence on QALYs could also be 
possible and we could perhaps expect to see a diff
 erential

eff
 ect between the two groups at the 12 month outcome 
assessment. Finally, our fi
 ndings cannot be generalised 
to women as CAP was developed and tested only in men. 
However, none of the content of CAP is sex specifi
 c and 
in our opinion there is no theoretical reason to believe 
that CAP would not work in women. Nevertheless, as 
alcohol consumption and its resulting problems are 
starting to increase in India, albeit from an extremely 
small base, study of this treatment in female harmful 
drinkers is needed.
The strengths of this trial lie in its design and the 
rigorous procedures followed in its implementation. 
The ratings of therapy quality, both independent and by 
supervisors, and the high levels of treatment completion 
testify to the acceptability and feasibility of this non-
specialist-delivered treatment. Another strength was 
that intensive assessments were not done at baseline as 
assessment reactivity has been found to be problematic 
in alcohol use disorder trials.47,48 Considered together 
with the companion study,17 the two PREMIUM trials 
represent a substantial achievement in global mental 
health for several reasons. First, the interventions are 
brief, delivered by lay people and provided to primary 
health-care attenders with few exclusion criteria, thus 
enhancing their generalisability to routine health care. 
Second, the treatment was delivered by the same 
counsellors who concurrently delivered the treatment 
for depression, mimicking the real world where 
patients would have a single counsellor in a health 
facility simultaneously treating the two leading mental 
health disorders worldwide. Third, the treatments are 
built around a theoretical orientation, which have a 
strong grounding in the psychological treatment 
literature. Finally, the trials report for the fi
 rst time 
evidence for the cost-eff
 ectiveness of psychological 
treatments for these two common mental health 
conditions from a low-income or middle-income 
country.
Further research should focus on replication and 
assessment of CAP’s eff
 ects on severe forms of alcohol 
use disorder, including as a component of a stepped care 
intervention for the full range of severity of alcohol use 
disorder. Our dissemination eff
 orts for CAP include 
launching of an online platform for those interested to 
learn about the treatment49 and an online documentary 
about the PREMIUM trials.50
