CD8+ T cells provide a critical defence from pathogens at mucosal epithelia including the
female reproductive tract (FRT). Mucosal immunisation is considered essential to initiate this
response, however this is difficult to reconcile with evidence that antigen delivered to skin can
recruit protective CD8+ T cells to mucosal tissues. Here we dissect the underlying
mechanism. We show that adenovirus serotype 5 (Ad5) bio-distributes at very low level to
non-lymphoid tissues after skin immunisation. This drives the expansion and activation of
CD3− NK1.1+ group 1 innate lymphoid cells (ILC1) within the FRT, essential for recruitment of
CD8+ T-cell effectors. Interferon gamma produced by activated ILC1 is critical to licence
CD11b+Ly6C+ monocyte production of CXCL9, a chemokine required to recruit skin primed
CXCR3+ CD8+T-cells to the FRT. Our findings reveal a novel role for ILC1 to recruit effector
CD8+ T-cells to prevent virus spread and establish immune surveillance at barrier tissues.

 T
he majority of pathogens, including HIV, influenza virus
and Mycobacterium tuberculosis that contribute to the
global burden of infectious disease initiate infection at the
mucosal barrier tissues. At least two subsets of memory CD8+
T cells patrol the mucosal tissues as a front line defence: a non-
recirculating, tissue-resident memory (TRM) population of CD8+
T cells1 and an effector memory (TEM) population of CD8+
T cells that circulate between the blood and non-lymphoid tis-
sues2. These subsets of CD8+ T cells are uniquely poised to
provide an immediate response, within minutes to hours of
pathogen detection at the barrier tissues and dictate the outcome
of infection. In direct contrast, circulating central memory (TCM)
CD8+ T cells require time to enter the tissues and respond to
pathogen infection. Accordingly, intense interest has focused on
immunisation strategies that promote recruitment of memory
CD8+ T-cell subsets to the mucosal epithelial tissues1,3,4.
Traditionally, the generation of antigen-specific T cells that
manifest defences at the epithelial barriers has been viewed as
dependent on mucosal routes of vaccination5–8, and priming by
antigen-bearing dendritic cells (DCs) at the mucosa and asso-
ciated draining lymphoid tissues9,10. Such DCs were found to
imprint distinct homing molecules that help gut/lung-activated
T cells to efficiently traffic to the anatomic site of pathogen
infection or immunisation and clear the antigen11–14. None-
theless, immunisation by systemic routes; intramuscular (IM),
subcutaneous (S.C.) and intradermal (I.D.) with replication
defective viral vectors, including adenovirus (Ad) and pox viruses
can effectively elicit and recruit polyfunctional antigen-specific
CD8+ T cells to mucosal barrier tissues15–18. These responses can
be long-lived and confer protection17. For example, scarification
of the skin with vaccinia virus (VV) or modified VV Ankara
protects
from
respiratory
pathogen
challenge
in
animal
models19,20. Importantly in humans, skin scarification with VV
remains a classic example of a successful vaccination strategy that
confers protection against smallpox (variola virus) infection that
is acquired by the aerosol route21. These reports would suggest
that cutaneous antigen exposure does not restrict seeding of
antigen experienced CD8+ T cells (effector and memory) to
the skin.
The mechanism/s that enable antigen-specific CD8+ T cells to
disseminate and acquire residence in epithelial barrier tissues
remote from the site of immunisation are unclear. While it is well
acknowledged that CD8+ T cells are programmed to express
adhesion and chemokine receptors specific to the site of immu-
nisation, emphasising the role of tissue DCs in determining T-cell
trafficking22,23, alternative mechanisms for CD8+ T-cell traf-
ficking must exist in parallel to explain T-cell dissemination to
remote, unrelated tissues. One paradigm states that a subset of
early effector CD8+ T cells may gain additional homing potential
by trafficking through distant lymph node (LN) microenviron-
ments, such that T cells originally activated in skin draining LNs
may acquire gut-homing molecules by trafficking through
mesenteric LNs24. Equally, there is evidence that the spleen
engenders early CD8+ T-cell effectors to acquire a gut-homing
programme through expressed α4β7, though migration to non-
intestinal tissues was not addressed25. It is also known that
inflammatory signals provided by topical chemokine application
to the vagina can recruit activated CD8+ T cells from the systemic
compartment to that tissue and establish a tissue-resident
memory pool by a ‘prime-pull’ strategy26. However, the capa-
city of (i) early spleen-derived CD8+ T-cell effectors to migrate to
epithelial tissues despite their not being the target of infection
and (ii) the potential crosstalk of innate effectors (including
macrophages, innate lymphoid cells and unconventional T cells)
within the epithelia that may provide signals to recruit CD8+
T cells remains unanswered. Given the importance of immune
surveillance at the epithelial barrier tissues and to reconcile see-
mingly disparate reports, we set out to gain further insights into
the mechanism by which skin immunisation generates CD8+
T cells that populate the mucosal epithelia.
Here, we report using a replication-defective Ad5 vector
encoding HIV-1 CN54 gag (Ad-CN54 gag) as a candidate vaccine
antigen, that skin immunisation generated CD8+ T cells that
uniformly expressed the chemokine receptor CXCR3 and con-
ferred protection in the female reproductive mucosa against a VV
challenge encoding the cognate antigen. We discovered that fol-
lowing skin immunisation, a low but consistent copy number of
vector DNA biodistributed to the female reproductive tract
(FRT). Importantly, while this low dose of biodistributed vector
was insufficient to prime CD8+ T cells locally in the FRT, it was
sufficient to recruit skin primed CXCR3+CD8+ T-cells inde-
pendent of antigen by CXCL9 (the cognate chemokine ligand for
CXCR3) produced by CD11b+Ly6C+ monocytes and also
by CD11b+ DC. Cell intrinsic interferon gamma (IFNγ) pro-
duced by group 1 innate lymphoid cells (ILC1) in the FRT was
essential to licence CXCL9 expression and recruit CD8+ T cells to
the tissue. These results reveal a previously unappreciated role for
ILC1 to mobilise effector CD8+ T cells to peripheral epithelial
tissues and provide a memory pool of tissue-resident CD8+
T cells to protect the host against infection.
Results
Skin immunisation elicits high-frequency CD8 T -cells in FRT.
We first investigated the capacity of skin immunisation to gen-
erate antigen-specific CD8+ T cells that localise in the female
reproductive mucosa. As a model system, B6 mice were immu-
nised with a relevant vaccine target, a synthetic HIV-1 gag CN54
gene (codon optimised for mammalian codon use) and expressed
from a replication defective Ad5 vector (Ad-CN54 gag) described
previously27.
Immunisation
was
performed
by
intradermal
injection (ID) and by a promising microneedle array (MA)
platform progressing through the clinic27, whose immunising
properties we reported are dependent on dermal DCs27. At 1 ×
109 viral particles (vp) Ad-CN54 gag, both skin immunisation
routes elicited as expected high frequency CD8+ T cells tracked
by tetramer (Tet) to the immunodominant Db-restricted HIV-1
CN54 gag308–318 epitope (Db/CN54 gag)17 in blood, spleen and
inguinal LN (Fig. 1a–d). Remarkably, both cutaneous routes of
immunisation-elicited high frequency Db/CN54 gag Tet+ CD8+
T cells that populated the FRT (Fig. 1d). The lower Ad vector
dose (1 × 107 vp) applied to the skin, elicited a markedly lower
frequency of Db/CN54 gag Tet+ CD8+ T cells recruited to the
FRT (Supplementary Fig. 1) consistent with previous Ad5 vac-
cination studies that report a vector dose-dependence for priming
systemic antigen-specific CD8 T cells27,28.
To exclude the possibility that proximity of the immunisation
site (back skin) influenced accumulation of CD8+ T cells in the
female FRT, mice were immunised to the dorsal surface of the ear
(Fig. 1e). Irrespective of the site of skin immunisation (ear or
back), the frequency of activated CD11ahiDb/CN54gag Tet+
CD8+ T cells detected in the FRT at day 14-post immunisation
was statistically indistinguishable (Fig. 1f, g). Having established
that skin immunisation has the capacity to recruit antigen-
specific CD8+ T cells to the FRT, we examined if this observation
might be extended to IM immunisation, a route commonly used
in human vaccination. There was a lower but not-significant
difference in frequency of CN54gag Tet+ CD8+ T cells recruited
to the FTR after IM immunisation when cross-compared with
skin immunisation (Supplementary Fig 2). Together these data
demonstrated that antigen-specific CD8+ T cells primed by skin
(and also IM) immunisation localise not only in lymphoid tissue

 draining the site of antigen encounter but also in non-lymphoid
tissue such as the FRT by a mechanism independent of the
anatomic site of immunisation or the mode of antigen delivery.
Skin primed FRT CD8 T- cells protect against VV challenge.
Given that antigen experienced CD8+ αβ+ T cells may express
regulatory or cytotoxic effector functions in mucosal tissues29–32
that are acquired during priming33, we determined if CD8+ T
cells localised in the FRT after skin immunisation expressed
cytolytic anti-viral activity. To that end, mice primed with Ad-
CN54 gag by ID injection or by MA immunisation were chal-
lenged by injection into the wall of the vagina on day 14 with
carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE)-labelled syngeneic
targets pulsed with peptide to the immunodominant Db-
restricted HIV-1 CN54 gag epitope34 and with control targets.
Cytotoxicity of CFSE-labelled donor cells isolated from the vagina
was analysed after 18 h by flow cytometry (Fig. 2a). Robust
antigen-specific in vivo killing was observed in the vagina of mice
14 days after skin immunisation (either ID or by MA) (Fig. 2b, c).
Furthermore, flow cytometry of cells isolated from the FRT tissue
of immunised mice, when re-stimulated in vitro with peptide to
the immunodominant Db-restricted CN54 gag epitope demon-
strated a substantial population of antigen-specific CD45+
MHCII− CD8+ cells expressed biomarkers of anti-viral CD8
effector T cells, IFNγ and/or Granzyme B (Fig. 2d, e). When
immunised or naive mice were challenged intravaginally 4 weeks
post ID or MA immunisation with 5 × 107 plaque-forming units
(pfu) recombinant VV expressing the cognate HIV-1 gag CN54
antigen (Fig. 2f), we found a significant decrease in viral titres
within the FRT of the immunised mice when cross-compared
with the naive group (P < 0.001, one-way ANOVA) on day 6 post
challenge (Fig. 2g). These data indicate that immunisation
through the skin has the capacity to induce a robust and pro-
tective CD8+ T-cell response in the FRT.
Biodistributed Ad5 is insufficient to prime FRT CD8 T- cells.
To determine the mechanism by which antigen-specific CD8+
T cells seed the FRT following skin immunisation, we first
enumerated Ad5 vector genomes by quantitative PCR in several
tissues at an early time point after immunisation to address if
virus biodistributed from the skin to the FRT and if that was
sufficient to locally prime CD8+T cells within the female repro-
ductive tissue. At 24 h post MA immunisation with Ad-CN54gag
(1 × 109 vp), a low but reproducible copy number of Ad genomes
were detected in the FRT tissue, liver, lung and spleen (Fig. 3a).
While the genome content in these tissues was significantly lower
than that detected in the skin (p < 0.001) or skin-draining LNs
(p < 0.05) by one-way ANOVA, it was consistently and markedly

 frequency of CD11ahiDb/CN54 gag Tet+ CD8+ T cells in the FRT
(Fig. 3d; Supplementary Fig. 3a, b) that was not statistically dif-
ferent from that elicited in the FRT after skin immunisation by
MA (p = 0.23 by one-way ANOVA). Therefore, the Ad-CN54 gag
virus dose biodistributed from the skin to the FRT was below the
threshold required to prime antigen-specific CD8+T cells locally
in the vagina and iliac LNs.
FRT CD8 T-cell recruitment requires CXCR3 independent of
Ag. We next addressed if effector CD8+ T cells from the systemic
compartment gained the ability to migrate to the FRT after skin
immunisation and if specific cues drove their migration. To that
end, Db/CN54 gag Tet+ CD8+ T cells in blood and FRT at day 7
after skin immunisation were screened by flow cytometry against
a chemokine receptor and integrin panel of acknowledged
homing molecules. Of note, chemokine receptors associated with
inflammation (CCR1, CXCR6) were expressed at high frequency
(Supplementary Fig. 4) with CXCR3 universally expressed
(>98%) on Db/CN54 gag Tet+ CD8+ T cells in the blood and
FRT at day 14 after skin (ID or MA) immunisation (Fig. 4a).
These observations were not restricted to the genital mucosal
tissues. High frequency activated Db/CN54 gag Tet+ CD8+
T cells were detected in the lung after ID/ MA immunisation
(Supplementary Fig. 5a) and the majority expressed CXCR3
(Supplementary
Fig.
5b).
Likewise,
the
CD8+
Tet−
Db/
CN54gag308–318 population from the FRT of immunised but not
naive mice was enriched for CXCR3+ expression (p < 0.05 by
one-way ANOVA) (Supplementary Fig 6). This may indicate
CXCR3+CD8+ T-cell effectors that are primed against additional
TCR specificities including the vector and the gag protein are
recruited to the FRT.
To test if CXCR3 expression was necessary to permit spleen-
derived CD8+ T-cell effectors to migrate to the FRT after
immunisation, we used a transfer system of congenic Rag−/−
CD45.1 T-cell receptor transgenic OT-I CD8+ T cells (CD45.1
OT-I) specific for the ovalbumin (OVA) peptide 257–264 to track
migration in groups of wild-type (WT) recipients immunised in
the skin (1 × 109 vp Ad-OVA) or by intravaginal injection with
the biodistributed virus dose (3.5 × 102 vp Ad-OVA / Ad-CN54
gag). To generate effector CD8+ T cells, 2 × 105 naive CD45.1
OT-I cells were transferred into WT mice. Six days after Ad-OVA
skin immunisation, some were treated with anti-CXCR3 Ab while
others were treated with isotype control Ab. On day 7, effector
CD45.1 OT-I cells (2 × 106) isolated from anti-CXCR3 Ab-treated
or
isotype control Ab-treated mice were transferred
into
secondary recipients (treated with anti-CXCR3 Ab or isotype
control Ab), which had been immunised by MA or by
intravaginal injection 3.5 days earlier (Fig. 4b). Flow cytometry
confirmed that surface CXCR3 was blocked on cells from anti-
CXCR3-treated mice (Supplementary Fig. 7). As a control for
antigen specificity, some secondary recipients were intravaginally
injected with Ad-CN54 gag or PBS 3.5 days prior to effector OT-I
cells transfer (Fig. 4b). After 1.5 days, CD45.1 OT-I cells were
quantified from recipient tissues. The number of CD45.1 OT-I
effectors recovered from the blood and spleen was similar in naive
and
immunised
mice,
irrespective
if
the
transferred
cells
expressed CXCR3 or were blocked for CXCR3 (Fig. 4c, d).

 were excluded from the FRT of naive recipients. In contrast, a
significant number of transferred CXCR3+CD45.1 OT-I cells
were recovered from the FRT, both of mice immunised with Ad-
OVA in the skin and from recipients immunised intravaginally
with the low virus dose that biodistributed from the skin to FRT
(Fig. 4e). Moreover, migration of transferred CD45.1 OT-I cells to
the FRT that was independent of the antigen encoded by the
intravaginally injected Ad vector, but was absolutely dependant
on CXCR3 expression of the transferred cells, as treatment with
anti-CXCR3 Ab inhibited CD45.1 OT-I cells homing to the FRT
(Fig. 4e). These data suggest that the low level of virus that bio-
distributes from the skin to the FRT is sufficient to recruit
systemic CD8+ T-cell effectors to the FRT and that migration was
dependant on expressed CXCR3, but independent of antigen
specificity.
Skin immunisation upregulates CXCL9 on FRT myeloid cells.
To test the hypothesis that innate cells in peripheral non-
lymphoid tissues remote from the site of immunisation played a
role in CD8+ T-cell recruitment to that tissue, we examined
myeloid populations for expression of CXCL9, an effector che-
mokine and cognate ligand of CXCR335 in the FRT after skin
immunisation. We found a significant increase in FRT CD45+
CD11b+ cells that expressed CXCL9 from skin immunised mice,
both ID and MA when compared with naive (Fig. 5a). Likewise in
the lung, there was a marked increase in CXCR9+CD45+CD11b+
cells after skin immunisation (Supplementary Fig. 8). Deeper
phenotypic analysis of CD11b+ cells revealed a distinct and sig-
nificant increase in the frequency of cells that expressed CXCL9
within the CD45+Ly6Chi CD11b+ MHCII− CD11c− population,
hereafter referred to as ‘Ly6Chi monocytes’ (Fig. 5b) and within
the CD45+CD11b+ MHCII+ CD11c+ population referred to as
‘dendritic cells’ (Fig. 5c) in the FRT at day 7 and for at least
14 days post skin immunisation (Supplementary Fig 9a, b).
Collectively, the data suggest that skin immunisation with an Ad-
vectored vaccine engenders expression of CXCL9 by CD11b+
subsets in peripheral non-lymphoid barrier tissues.
FRT monocytes and ILC1 accumulate after skin immunisation.
Our observation that monocytes within the FRT expressed
CXCL9, an IFNγ-inducible chemokine in the context of skin
immunisation, raised the possibility that production of CXCL9
may be enforced by innate lymphoid cells, such as classical nat-
ural killer cells reported capable of producing IFNγ36,37. There
are precedents to support this idea as adenovirus is a strong
inducer of NK cell activation28,38,39 and NK cell-derived IFNγ
can prime monocyte functions40. To that end, we assessed the
kinetics of monocyte and ‘NK-like’ ILC1 accumulation in the
blood and FRT after skin (MA) immunisation with Ad-CN54
gag. As expected, NK-like ILC1 (defined as CD3− NK1.1+ and
referred to hereafter as ILC1) and Ly6Chi monocytes rapidly
accumulated in the blood within 3 h of skin immunisation,
peaked after 6 h and returned to baseline at 24 h, with a second
influx (increase) in blood Ly6Chi monocytes at 48 h after
immunisation (Fig. 6a; Supplementary Fig. 10). Contrastingly, a
peak in frequency of ILC1 within the FRT was evident at 24 h that
represented a 2.2-fold increase compared with naive mice
(Fig. 6b), with CD69 (an early activation and tissue retention

 marker) highly expressed on the majority of ILC1 (Fig. 6b). A
significant influx of Ly6Chi monocytes within the FRT was not
apparent until 72 h post skin immunisation (Fig. 6b), but
remained elevated for at least 14 days (Supplementary Fig. 11).
Thus, after skin immunisation with an Ad5-vectored vaccine,
there is a marked accumulation of CD69+ ILC1 in the FRT that
have the potential to engage in crosstalk with recruited Ly6Chi
monocytes.
Biodistributed Ad5 sufficient to recruit monocytes and ILC1.
Next, we addressed if biodistribution of virus from the skin to
peripheral tissues in the context of skin immunisation was suf-
ficient to induce the observed increase in ILC1 and Ly6Chi
monocytes within the FRT. Mice were administered Ad-CN54
gag, either 1 × 109 vp by MA to the skin or 3.5 × 102 vp
(equivalent to the biodistributed virus dose) by injection into the
wall of the vagina (Fig. 7a). At 24 h post virus immunisation, a
substantial increase in frequency and the total number of ILC1
was detected in the FRT of immunised relative to naive mice (p <
0.001 and p < 0.01, respectively, by one-way ANOVA) that was
not significantly different if the low (biodistributed equivalent)
virus dose was injected intravaginally as opposed to skin priming
by MA (Fig. 7c; Supplementary Fig. 7). Likewise, at 72 h post
immunisation, the low virus dose injected intravaginally led to a
significant increase in frequency and the total number of Ly6Chi
monocytes within the FRT relative to naive mice (p < 0.01,
Fig. 7e) that was not significantly different (p>0.05) from mice
immunised by MA in the skin (Fig. 7e; Supplementary Fig. 12)
analysed by one-way ANOVA. Of note, the stress response from
injection into the vaginal wall (with PBS) did not account for the
increase in FRT ILC1 or Ly6Chi monocytes associated with the
intravaginally injected low virus dose (Fig. 7e; Supplementary
Fig. 12). These data strongly suggest that virus biodistributed
from the skin to the FRT after skin immunisation is sufficient to
modify the peripheral tissue environment such that this resulted
in recruitment of ILC1 and inflammatory monocytes to the FRT
tissue.
CD8 T-cell recruitment to FRT requires ILC1 intrinsic IFNγ.
To better understand the role of innate lymphoid-like cells in
recruitment of CD8+ T cells to the FRT, we treated mice with an
anti-NK1.1-depleting antibody 1 day prior to and at 3-day
intervals
following skin
immunisation
with Ad-CN54
gag
(Fig. 8a). This treatment resulted in nearly complete ablation of
the CD45+ CD3− ILC1 population in the FRT and CD3−CD19−
ILC1 cells in the blood (Supplementary Fig. 13). Strikingly, we
observed that anti-NK1.1 antibody treatment was associated with
a significant decrease in the frequency of Db/CN54 gag Tet+
CD8+ T cells in the FRT when compared with the control treated
group (p < 0.01, by one-way ANOVA, Fig. 8c). Conversely, there
was no such substantial decrease in Db/CN54 gag Tet+ CD8+
T cells in the blood after anti-NK1.1 antibody treatment, Fig. 8b).
Moreover, expression of CXCR3+ remained unchanged on Db/
CN54 gag Tet+ CD8+ T cells in the blood or FRT after anti-
NK1.1 antibody treatment (Fig. 8d, e). Thus CD8+ T-cell
recruitment to the FRT after skin immunisation showed a
strong dependence on ILC1 within the FRT, despite this tissue
not being the site of immunisation.

 Since accumulation of ILC1 preceded peak expansion of
inflammatory monocytes in the FRT (Fig. 6b) and expression of
CXCR3 was essential for CD8+ T-cell recruitment (Fig. 4), we
reasoned that ILC1 might be crucial to programme expression
of CXCL9 by Ly6Chi monocytes and enable CXCR3-driven CD8+
T-cell
recruitment
to
the
FRT.
Treatment
with
anti-
NK1.1 significantly decreased the frequency of CXCL9+ Ly6Chi
monocytes in the FRT at 72 h after skin immunisation compared
with immunised control treated mice (Fig. 8f, g) consistent with the
hypothesis that innate lymphoid cells play a key role in priming
CXCL9 expression by FRT inflammatory monocytes in the context
of skin immunisation. That IFNγ might be essential in priming
CXCL9 by Ly6Chi monocytes in this system was addressed by
injecting wild-type and RAG-1-deficient (Rag1−/−) mice that lack
conventional T cells, NKT cells and B cells41 with anti-IFNγ on the
day prior to and daily after skin immunisation with Ad-CN54 gag
(Fig. 8h). Anti-IFNγ significantly impaired the increase in frequency
of CXCL9+ Ly6Chi monocytes within the FRT associated with skin
immunisation (Fig. 8i, j) both in wild-type and Rag1−/− mice,
suggesting an innate cell intrinsic IFNγ source was necessary to
induce CXCL9. Consistent with that concept, the CXCL9 response
of FRT Ly6Chi monocytes following skin immunisation with Ad-
CN54 gag was unaltered in Rag2−/−γc-deficient (Rag2−/− X IL-
2Rγcnull) mice (that lack innate lymphoid cells) when cross-
compared with the response of naïve Rag2−/−γc-deficient and in
contrast to wild-type immunised mice (Fig. 8j). Taken together,
these data are consistent with the conclusion that innate lymphoid
cell intrinsic IFNγ in the local environment of the FRT is necessary
and sufficient to promote CXCL9 production by Ly6Chi monocytes
and licence recruitment of CXCR3+ CD8+ T cells to the FRT
following skin immunisation.
Discussion
Innate lymphoid cells, emphasised by the group 1 subset are
recognised to play an important role in protecting the epithelial
barriers against intracellular infection37,42,43. This has been
attributed to their capacity to rapidly produce IFNγ in response
to local pro-inflammatory cytokines40,44. In this way, they
directly restrict early pathogen replication at the initial site of
infection42–46. Until now, it has been unappreciated that signals
communicated by innate lymphoid cells can also permit CD8+
T cells primed after skin immunisation (or infection) to seed
distal epithelial tissues, despite these tissues not being the target of
infection. In this way, innate lymphoid cells can indirectly pro-
vide protection at the epithelia from secondary pathogen spread
or future infection via promoting T-cell recruitment. Here, we
elucidate how this occurs using an Ad vaccine vector. After skin
immunisation, vaccine vector biodistributes at very low levels to
peripheral tissues, including the FRT that is sufficient to mobilise

 primed CXCR3-expressing CD8+ T cells to that tissue. Our study
revealed that an innate lymphoid cell population in the local
tissue
could
orchestrate
CXCR3-dependent
recruitment
by
responding rapidly and prime CXCL9 production by Ly6Chi
monocytes via cell intrinsic IFNγ. Together, our data suggest a
general mechanism whereby ILC1 can regulate antigen-primed
CXCR3+ CD8+ T cells to barrier tissues that are not the target
site of immunisation. Importantly, we demonstrate that this
mechanism provides protection from VV pathogen challenge in
the FRT.
It is currently understood that exposure of the vaginal mucosa
to topically applied chemokines or to microbicides that create
non-specific inflammation permits recruitment of systemically
primed CD8+ T cells to the FRT26,47. This implies that signals
derived from the microenvironment of epithelial barrier tissues
can ‘pull’ circulating effector CD8+ T cells into the tissue and

CD8+ TRM cells in the tissue17,25,26,47. Our data advance this
concept by demonstrating that immunisation through the skin
(and also by the IM route) with an Ad5 vaccine vector instructs
peripheral tissues including the FRT and lung to recruit sys-
temically generated CD8+ T-cell effectors. In agreement with
Nakanishi et al.48, CD8+ T-cell-expressed CXCR3 was absolutely
essential for CD8+ T-cell recruitment to the FRT. Nonetheless,
the mechanism conditioning the FRT (and lung) to express the
requisite cognate chemokine ligand differ, likely dictated by
the pathogen/vaccine and site of pathogen/vaccine exposure.
These different contexts might explain a seeming paradox that
CD4+ T-cell-induced IFNγ is essential for CXCL9-driven CD8+
T-effector extravasation to the FRT and lung in respect of local
HSV-2 and influenza virus infection, respectively48,49. In contrast,
our study showed that NK1.1+ ILC1 intrinsic IFNγ, but not
CD4+ T-cell-induced IFNγ, is necessary and sufficient to drive
Ly6Chi monocyte-expressed CXCL9. This is essential for NK1.1-
dependent CD8+ effector T recruitment to the FRT where the
initial Ad5 virus vector exposure is in the skin. Thus NK1.1+
ILC1 can provide an IFNγ signalling module and licence CXCL9
production that resembles an effector function provided by CD4+
Th1 cells36,37,50, but differs from CD4+ Th1 cells by the absence
of TCR specificity in initiation of CXCL9-driven CD8+ T effector
extravasation. The licensing properties of ILC1 reported herein
are consistent with the ability of activated NK cells to cluster with
CD11b+ cells51,52 and Ly6Chi monocytes44 during infection and
prime their activation via IFNγ44,53. Therefore, Ly6Chi monocytes
and CD11b+ DCs are likely complementary as producers of a
CXCL9 microenvironment necessary for recruitment of sys-
temically primed CD8+ effector T cells to epithelial barrier tis-
sues. Our findings bare direct relevance to optimising delivery of
vaccines where local immune surveillance by recruited CD8+
T cells plays a critical role in protection at the epithelial
barrier3,54. In contrast, vaccines that provide antibody-based
protection at the cervico-vaginal epithelia, exemplified by the IM-
administered prophylactic HPV sub-unit vaccine, have been
proposed to work by a different mechanism, transudation or
exudation of serum IgG as opposed to providing signals to recruit
antibody-secreting cells to the epithelia55.
An outstanding question remains, how do ILC1 within distant
epithelial barrier tissues proliferate and undergo activation that
conditions the FTR to recruit CD8+ T effectors in response to
skin immunisation? Immune connectivity across distant epithe-
lial barrier tissues has been revealed previously following skin
vaccination17,25,26,47,56. This may reflect the action of type I
IFN56 or other innate mediators responding at the site of
immunisation57, acting systemically that may be essential for
ILC1 activation. Unlike MVA56 or adjuvanted vaccines57, rAd5,
used in this study, is a weak inducer of serum IFNα28,58. Equally,
type I IFN-dependent activation of NK cells is not a property of
rAd558, thus other mechanisms must operate. Intriguingly, our
study found a low but consistent copy number of vaccine vector
genomes in peripheral non-lymphoid tissues (including the FRT)
after skin immunisation, consistent with previous reports59–61.
The biodistributed Ad5 vector dose in this study had the capacity
to recruit populations of ILC1, Ly6Chi monocytes and CXCR3hi
CD8+ T effector cells to the FRT after intravaginal injection of
naive mice. This leads us to speculate that low levels of virus
vector may bypass subcapsular sinus macrophages in skin-
draining LN after immunisation and disseminate systemically62.
There is a precedence that blood monocytes can rapidly interact
with Ad563 and are highly suited to hijack and transport virus or
virus genome via the blood circulation to distal tissues64,65.
Equally, monocytes are acknowledged to enter extravascular
tissues and replenish resident monocyte-derived cells under
steady-state conditions66,67. This might be one mechanism by
which crosstalk between monocytes carrying virus/vector gen-
ome and tissue-resident ILC initiate a feedback loop to recruit
waves of monocytes and ILC1 that may condition the FTR in the
context of skin immunisation. Although our study with Ad5-
vectored vaccines emphasised local activation of innate NK 1.1+
cells and their role in orchestrating recruitment of CD8+ T
effector and CD8+ TRM cells to the FRT after skin immunisation,
our findings do not preclude if this response state of NK1.1+
cells might also be dictated in part by cytokines acting systemi-
cally from the site of immunisation68. Additional studies with
other vaccine vectors and forms of immunogens will be
important.
In conclusion, we have defined a mechanism whereby skin
vaccination induces low-level inflammation in the FRT that is
sufficient to promote CD8+ T-cell recruitment through a CXCL9-
dependent mechanism licensed by ILC1 cells. These data may
have important implications for vaccine designs against patho-
gens transmitted across epithelial barrier tissues and highlight the
attributes of the skin as a delivery site to stimulate prophylactic
and therapeutic immunity against vaginally acquired infections.
Methods
Recombinant adenovirus vaccines. Replication-deficient, E1, E3-deleted adeno-
virus type 5 (Ad5) vaccine vectors were propagated in low-passage human embryo
kidney 293 (293AD) cells (Cambridge Biosciences) at a multiplicity of infection of
25 virus particles per cell (as titrated by the DNA Pico-Green assay, Invitrogen)
and then purified by the Native Antigen Company. Viruses were stored at −80 °C
until use. rAd5-HIV-1 CN54 gag encodes a codon optimised synthetic HIV-1
CN54 gag gene reported previously27. Ad5-OVA encodes a non-secreted chicken
ovalbumin gene, constructed by Dr M. Zenke’s laboratory (Aachen University,
Aachen, Germany)27. Virus particle titres were determined by the DNA Pico-
Green assay (Invitrogen).

 Recombinant vaccinia virus HIV-1 CN54 gag. A codon optimised synthetic HIV-
1 CN54 gag gene sequence (Supplementary Fig. 14) was amplified using HIV-1
CN54 gag primers (Supplementary Table 1) using high-fidelity PCR by Invitrogen
pFx polymerase and inserted into a plasmid containing vaccinia virus thymidine
kinase flanking arms (pVACV-TK). The recombinant plasmid was sequenced to
confirm insertion and sequence fidelity. Sub-confluent BHK cells (2 × 106 cells)
were transfected with 2 µg of pVACV-TK-CN54gag using Lipofectamine and Plus
Reagent (Invitrogen) and co-infected with parental VACV:GyrB-PKR at an MOI of
0.05 pfu/cell. At 30 h post infection, cells were scraped and virus released by three
rounds of freeze–thaw treatment followed by sonication. RK13 cells pre-treated
with coumermycin A1 (100 ng/ml) for 16 h were infected with dilutions of the
in vitro recombined virus extract and overlaid with media containing cou-
mermycin. Thirty hours post infection, plaques were isolated and amplified under
selection with cumeromycin in RK13 cells. Amplified virus was purified by cen-
trifugation through 36% sucrose. Virus was maintained under selection at all times,
and sequences were confirmed by Arizona State University core sequencing
laboratory.
Fabrication of microneedle arrays (MA). Dissolvable microneedles (1500 µm in
length, 670 µm in base diameter and 44 per array) were fabricated by a cen-
trifugation casting method (at 1780×g for 1 min) using an inverted cone-shaped
silicone template. Vaccine vectors were formulated in the matrix of the needle tips
at a 1:1 ratio with sodium carboxyl methylcellulose (8% wt/vol Na-CMC) and
sucrose (30% wt/vol). A second layered matrix (12% Na-CMC, 4.8% lactose)
created the needle shaft and a pre-made membrane (8% Na-CMC, 0.8% lactose)
formed the needle base. After air drying (24 h at room temperature), the MAs were
carefully removed from the template and stored in a desiccator at room
temperature.
Mice. Female mice at 7–8 weeks of age were used in this study. C57BL/6 mice were
purchased from Envigo. Rag−/− OT-I mice on a CD45.1 background (B6.SJL
CD45.1) were from The Francis Crick Institute (London) and Rag1−/− and
Rag2−/−γcnull mice were bred at King’s College London. The minimum numbers
of mice required to obtain statistically significant and reliable results were used.
The number of animals within each study arm is denoted within the appropriate
figure legends.
Ethics statement. All animal husbandry and experimentation were approved by
King’s College London ethics committee and performed under a project license
granted by the United Kingdom Home Office.
Depo-Provera synchronisation. All mice in this study received medrox-
yprogesterone acetate, Depo-Provera (Depo®, Pfizer) at a dose of 3 mg by s.c.
injection 5 days before each experiment.
Immunisation models. Mice received either 1 × 109 vp (or where indicated 1 × 107
vp) of rAd5 vaccine vector either by MA administration, where MAs were applied
manually with gentle pressure (5 min) to the shaved dorsal surface of the ear or
back skin (as indicated) or by ID or IM injection. In some experiments, mice
received the designated dose (or a lower dose, where indicated) of rAd5 vaccine
vector by injection directly into the vaginal wall.
Adoptive transfer. Naive donor antigen-specific CD8+ T cells were isolated from
the spleens of CD45.1+ transgenic OT-I mice and magnetically purified (>96%)
using a CD8 T cell isolation kit (Stemcell Technologies). For effector cell genera-
tion, 2 × 105 naive CD45.1 OT-I CD8+ donor T cells were adoptively transferred
into recipient B6 mice. The next day, recipients were immunised ID with 1 × 109 vp
of rAd5-OVA. Some recipient mice were injected i.p. with a blocking antibody
against CXCR3 (200 µg, clone: CXCR3–173, 2BScientific) at day 6 post immuni-
sation. FACS analysis confirmed CXCR3 depletion (>99.5%). Effector OT-I cells
(either CXCR3 depleted or not) were isolated from the spleen at 7 days post
immunisation. Single-cell suspensions were purified using the MagniSortTM mouse
CD45.1 positive selection kit, and then 2 × 106 cells were transferred i.v into naive
hosts or into secondary recipients immunised 3.5 days previous to cell transfer with
either rAd5-OVA (by skin MA or by intravaginal immunisation) or with rAd5-
HIV-1 CN54 gag or with PBS by intravaginal immunisation (as indicated). On the
day of cell transfer, recipients of CXCR3 blocked CD45.1 OT-I also received an i.p.
injection of 200 µg of anti-CXCR3 antibody (clone: CXCR3–173, 2BScientific).
After one and a half days, the numbers of CD45.1 OT-I cells harvested from the
blood, spleen and FRT of naive and secondary recipients were analysed by flow
cytometry.
Isolation of cells from tissues. At various time points, single-cell suspensions
were prepared from blood, spleen and LNs and re-suspended in complete RPMI
[RPMI medium 1640 supplemented with 100 U/mL penicillin, 100 μg/mL strep-
tomycin, 2 mM L-glutamine (Invitrogen) and 10% heat-inactivated FBS (Biosera).
The liver, lung and FRT (where indicated) were harvested following perfusion.
Single-cell suspensions from the FRT and lung were obtained by enzymatic
digestion for 30 min at 37 °C using 1 mg/mL Collagenase D (RocheTM) and 0.02
mg/mL DNase I from bovine pancreas (RocheTM).
Flow cytometry. The following antibodies (including clone and catalogue number)
were purchased from BD Bio-sciences: purified anti-FcRII/III mAb (CD16/32,
2.4G2), anti-CD8 (53–6.7), anti-CD4 (RM4–5), anti-CD11b (M1/70), anti-CD3
(145–2C11), anti-MHC class II (2G9), anti-Gr-1 (RB6–8C5), anti-CD45R/B220
(RA3–6B2), anti-CD25 (7D4), anti-CD4 (GK1.5), anti-CD115 (AFS98), anti-
NKp46 (29A1.4), anti-CD49b (DX5), anti-CCR1 (S15040E), anti-CCR5 (HM-
CCR5), anti-CCR6 (29–2L17), anti-CCR7 (4B12), anti-CCR9 (9B1), anti-CCR10
(6588–5), anti-CXCR3 (CXCR3–173), anti-CXCR6 (SA051D1), anti-CXCL9
(MIG-2F5.5), anti-CD11c (HL3) and anti-α4β7 (DATK32). In addition, anti-IFNγ
(XMG1.2), anti-Granzyme B (NGZB), anti-Ly6C (HK1.4), anti-CD69 (H1.2F3)
and anti-CD11a (M17/4) were obtained from eBioscience. Anti-NKp46 (29A1.4),
anti-NK1.1 (PK136), anti-CD45 (30F-11), anti-CD8 (53–6.7), anti-CD45.1 (A20),
anti-CD45.2 (104), anti-CD11c (N418) and anti-MHCII (M5/114.15.2) were
acquired from Biolegend. Dilutions at which antibodies were used are shown in
Supplementary Table 2. Tetramers to the immunodominant H-2Db-restricted
HIV-1 CN54 gag 308–318 epitope (Db/CN54gag) were kindly synthesised by the
NIH Tetramer core facility (Emory University, USA). Cells were stained with Db/
CN54gag tetramer (15 min) at room temperature, followed by addition of cell-
surface antibodies (20 min) and then re-washed. For intracellular cytokine staining,
1 × 106 cells per mL were incubated 6 h at 37 °C with anti-CD28 (2 μg/mL) either
alone (unstimulated control) or with peptide HIV-1 CN54 gag 308–318 (2 μg/mL).
Brefeldin A (10 μg/mL) (Sigma-Aldrich) was added for the last 5 h of culture. After
washing, cells were incubated with anti-FcγRII/III (10 min), followed by staining
with Db/CN54gag tetramer (15 min) prior to incubation with antibodies to cell-
surface markers (20 min). Cells were fixed and permeabilized with the BD Cytofix/
Cytoperm Kit according to the manufacturers’ instructions and then stained
simultaneously with the Db/CN54gag tetramer, anti-IFNγ and anti-Granzyme B
antibodies (20 min). Samples were acquired using a BD FACSCanto II or BD SORP
LSRFortessa™ flow cytometer and analysed using FlowJo software version 9.7.5
(Tree Star) for Mac. Gating strategies to track Db/CN54gag Tet+ CD8+ T cells in
blood, LN, FRT, lung and spleen are shown in Supplementary Fig. 15. Gating
strategy to define (i) Ly6Chi monocytes, DCs and NK1.1+ (ILC1) cells in blood and
FRT; (ii) to examine CXCL9 expression by Ly6Chi monocytes and DCs in blood,
FRT and lung and (iii) to examine CD45.1+ OT-1 cells following adoptive transfer
in tissues are shown in Supplementary Fig 16.
Quantitative real-time PCR for adenovirus copy number. Quantitation of Ad5
copy number in tissues after MA immunisation was conducted by using a real-time
TaqMan RT-PCR system. DNA was purified from collected tissues using a Gene
EluteTM Mammalian Genomic DNA kit (SIGMA-ALDRICH), according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. The purified DNA was mixed with TaqMan PreAmp
Master Mix (2x) (Applied Biosystem), the primer pair (Supplementary Table 1)
and TaqMan Probe FAM-taccagaacgaccacagca-MGB (total volume per reaction:
10 μl). The mixture was amplified in an automated fluorometer, QuantStudio5
(Applied Biosystem) under the following conditions: 40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s and
60 °C for 60 s. rAd5-HIV-1 CN54 gag was used as a standard.
Virus challenge and plaque assay. Groups of mice were challenged by depositing
5 × 107 vp of rVV-CN54gag into the vaginal cavity and monitored for 6 days. FRT
tissues were harvested at 6 days post rVV-CN54gag challenge and homogenised by
enzymatic digestion for 30 min at 37 °C using 1 mg/ml Collagenase D (RocheTM).
The supernatants were serially diluted (10–2 to 10–7) in the Dulbecco’s modified
Eagle’s medium (DMEM) and added onto BSC-40 cell monolayers for 1 h at 37 °C.
Cells were then cultured in complete DMEM containing 5% heat-inactivated FBS
and containing coumermycin A1 (100 ng/ml) for 48 h before fixation an de-
staining with 0.1% crystal violet solution for counting viral pfu.
In vivo killing assay. Naive syngeneic splenocytes were labelled with CFSE at 5 μM
(CFSEhi) or 0.5 μM (CFSElo), pulsed with or without peptide to the immunodo-
minant Db restricted HIV-1 CN54 gag epitope (5 μg/ml), then 1 × 106 cells (mixed
at a 1:1 ratio) injected using a Hamilton syringe with 30G needle into the vaginal
wall of immunised or naive control mice and harvested after 24 h to measure
in vivo cytolysis of target cells by the loss of the CFSEhi peptide-pulsed population
relative to the control CFSElo population by flow cytometry.
In vivo antibody-dependent cell depletion or neutralisation. For depletion of
NK1.1 expressing innate cells, mice were injected with 200 µg of purified mono-
clonal NK1.1 antibody (PK136, BioXcell) i.p. 24 h before immunisation, followed
by injections on day 0, 3, 6, 9 and 12. For IFNγ neutralisation, mice were injected
i.p. with purified anti-IFNγ antibody (XMG1.2, BioXcell) 24 h before and daily
after immunisation. Control mice received their corresponding isotype Ab.
Statistical analysis. The results were analysed with GraphPad PRISMTM version
6.0 (San Diego, CA, USA). Bars in figures show the mean ± SEM. Comparisons
between groups were performed using a one-way ANOVA in conjunction with
