IMPORTANCE Population-based prevalence estimates of age-related macular degeneration
(AMD) need to be determined to assess its burden among Chinese Americans, the fastest
growing racial group in the United States.
OBJECTIVE To determine the age- and sex- specific prevalence of AMD among Chinese
Americans.
DESIGN The Chinese American Eye Study (CHES) was conducted in a general urban
community of 10 census tracts in Monterey Park, California. A total of 4582 Chinese American
adults aged 50 years or older participated in this population-based, cross-sectional study
from February 16, 2010, through October 9, 2013, and underwent an interview as well as
comprehensive clinical and eye examinations, including detailed retinal photography of both
eyes. Fundus photographs were graded for drusen and retinal pigment epithelium
abnormalities and were evaluated for AMD.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The prevalence of early and advanced AMD, drusen,
geographic atrophy, and neovascular AMD were determined by using a modified Wisconsin
Age-Related Maculopathy Grading Scale (a 6-level scale: 10, no AMD; 60, advanced AMD).
RESULTS Of the 4582 participants completing both the home survey and clinical
examination, 4172 individuals (91.1%) had at least 1 gradable photograph. A total of 1526
(36.6%) participants were men, and the mean (SD) age was 61.2 (8.8) years. When examined
by 10-year age groups, the prevalence of early AMD ranged from 5.8% (n = 119) in
participants aged 50 to 59 years to 17.6% (n = 37) in those 80 years or older, retinal pigment
epithelium abnormalities from 4.1% (n = 85) to 7.2% (n = 16), large drusen (�125 μm) from
9.8% to 32.4%, soft drusen from 27.6% (n = 567) to 58.6% (n = 123), and soft indistinct
drusen from 3.7% (n = 76) to 15.2% (n = 32). The prevalence of advanced AMD ranged from
0.2% (n = 3) in participants aged 50 to 59 years to 1.0% (n = 2) in those 80 years or older. Of
the 14 cases of advanced AMD, 85.7% (95% CI, 57.2%-98.2%; n = 12) were neovascular AMD
and 14.3% (95% CI, 2.0%-42.8%; n = 2) were geographic atrophy. Acute macular
degeneration was more common in men (10.9% [9.3%-12.5%]; n = 166) than women (5.8%
[4.9%-6.7%]; n = 154) in this cohort.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Data from CHES suggest that Chinese Americans have a lower
prevalence of early and advanced AMD compared with non-Hispanic white individuals. The
prevalence of early AMD, advanced AMD, and large drusen was higher among Chinese
Americans in CHES than among the Chinese population living in urban/rural China but lower
than that in urban-dwelling Taiwanese.

A
ge-related macular degeneration (AMD) is one of the
major causes of blindness and visual impairment in el-
derly residents of the United States.1,2 Previous
studies3-5 have found AMD prevalence to vary across racial and
ethnic groups within the country. One multiethnic study3 of
AMD in persons without cardiovascular disease found a higher
prevalence of neovascular AMD in persons of Chinese ances-
try compared with the prevalence in African American, La-
tino,andnon-HispanicwhiteindividualsresidingintheUnited
States.Population-baseddataregardingtheprevalenceofAMD
in Chinese Americans and how the data compare with infor-
mation on other racial/ethnic groups are limited.
According to the 2010 census,6 Chinese Americans are the
most populous Asian group in the United States and repre-
sent the most rapidly growing racial group in the US popula-
tion based on data from 2000 to 2010.7 Precise estimates of
AMD prevalence in persons of Chinese ancestry living in the
United States have not been determined. Existing estimates
are based on data from selected populations developed to ad-
dress nonocular outcomes and therefore may not represent
Chinese Americans.3,8
Resultsfrompopulation-basedstudiesofAMDinChina9,10
and Taiwan11 within the past decade suggest that the preva-
lence of early AMD might be between 3.0% to 9.2% among Chi-
nese and that the prevalence is higher in older populations.
However, data on persons of Chinese ancestry outside the
United States may not be generalizable to Chinese Americans
owing to differences in environmental exposures (eg, smok-
ing, UV exposure), dietary patterns, health care–seeking be-
havior, and access to health care.
Additional data to characterize the prevalence of AMD in
Chinese Americans are needed to describe the burden of eye
diseaseinthispopulationandtoguidethedevelopmentofpre-
ventive screening practices and resource planning. To our
knowledge,theChineseAmericanEyeStudy(CHES)isthelarg-
est, most comprehensive population-based study of eye dis-
ease among persons of Chinese ancestry—specifically Chi-
nese Americans aged 50 years or older—designed to allow
precise estimates of AMD prevalence. This study determined
the age- and sex-specific prevalence of early and advanced
AMD, drusen size and type, and retinal pigment epithelium
(RPE) abnormalities among Chinese Americans. Further-
more, we compare the prevalence in CHES with prevalences
from population-based studies among Chinese individuals liv-
ing in other countries and among other racial/ethnic groups
within the United States.
Methods
Study Cohort
CHES is a population-based, cross-sectional study of eye
diseases in urban Chinese Americans residing in 10 census
tracts in Monterey Park, California. The study area was cho-
sen based on the communities’dense and stable population
of Chinese Americans. Eligible participants were identified
by a door-to-door census, followed by a screening interview
to confirm eligibility, including age (≥50 years) and self-
identified Chinese ancestry. Participants underwent a
detailed interview at home and a comprehensive eye exami-
nation conducted in the clinic. Data were collected from
February 16, 2010, through October 9, 2013. More details of
the study design and sampling plan can be found elsewhere.12
This study was reviewed and approved by the Health Sci-
ences Institutional Review Board and the ethics committee
of the University of Southern California. The participants
provided written informed consent; there was no financial
compensation.
Grading of Fundus Photographs for AMD
A modification of the Wisconsin Age-Related Maculopathy
Grading System13 was used to perform masked grading. In this
6-level system, 10 indicates hard drusen or small soft drusen
less than 125 μm in diameter only, regardless of area of in-
volvement, and no pigmentary abnormality (increased reti-
nal pigment or RPE depigmentation) present (no AMD); 20 in-
dicates hard drusen or small soft drusen less than 125 μm in
diameter, regardless of area of involvement, with any pigmen-
taryabnormality(increasedretinalpigmentpresentand/orRPE
depigmentation) present or soft drusen 125 μm or more in di-
ameter with drusen area less than 196 350 μm2 (equivalent to
a circle with a diameter of 500 μm) and no pigmentary abnor-
malities; 30 indicates soft drusen 125 μm or more in diameter
with drusen area less than 196 350 μm2 with any pigmentary
abnormality (increased retinal pigment present and/or RPE de-
pigmentation) present or soft drusen 125 μm or more in diam-
eter with drusen area greater than 196 350 μm2 with or with-
out increased retinal pigment but no RPE depigmentation; 40
indicates soft drusen 125 μm or more in diameter with drusen
area 196 350 μm2 equivalent to a circle with a diameter of
500 μm) and RPE depigmentation present, with or without
increased retinal pigment; 50 indicates the presence of pure
geographic atrophy in the absence of neovascular macular
degeneration; and 60 indicates the presence of neovascular
macular degeneration with or without geographic atrophy
(severe AMD).
Two graders at the Wisconsin Ocular Epidemiology Grad-
ing Center assessed each eye for the presence of lesions asso-
ciated with AMD. Discrepancies in assessments between the
2 graders were reassessed by a senior grader (R.K.). There was
Key Points
Question What is the prevalence of age-related macular
degeneration (AMD) in the Chinese American Eye Study?
Findings In this population-based, cross-sectional study of
Chinese American individuals, AMD prevalence ranged from 5.8%
in participants aged 50 to 59 years to 17.6% in those 80 years or
older, retinal pigment epithelium abnormalities from 4.1% to 7.2%,
large drusen from 9.8% to 32.4%, soft drusen from 27.6% to
58.6%, and soft indistinct drusen from 3.7% to 15.2%.
Meaning The prevalence of AMD in this study is higher than that
in other studies of Chinese populations living in urban and rural
China but lower than in urban-dwelling Taiwanese and
non-Hispanic white populations.

moderatetoexcellentintergraderagreement(weightedκ,0.74-
0.93) during the approximate 3.5 years of data collection.
Definition of AMD and Associated Lesions
Drusen
Drusen were evaluated based on their size, sharpness of the
edges, and overall uniformity. Total drusen size was calcu-
lated by combining the area in each eye. Individual druse were
classified as hard indistinct, hard distinct, soft distinct, or soft
indistinct/reticular.
RPE Abnormalities
Photographs were graded for the presence of RPE depigmen-
tation or increased pigmentation according to the Wisconsin
Age-Related Maculopathy Grading System. Pigment abnor-
malities caused by non-AMD processes were excluded from
analyses.
Early Age-Related Macular Degeneration
Early AMD was defined as the presence of any soft indistinct
drusen or any drusen with RPE abnormalities in the absence
of advanced lesions.
Advanced AMD
Advanced AMD was defined as the presence of geographic at-
rophy or neovascular (exudative) AMD, macular thickening,
hemorrhage, and disciform scar not associated with other
conditions. Geographic atrophy was characterized by 1 or more
sharply defined, fairly circular patches of partial or complete
depigmentation of the RPE, 125 μm or more in diameter, and
with visible choroidal vessels. Signs of neovascular AMD in-
cluded RPE detachment, serous detachment of the sensory
retina, subretinal hemorrhage, subretinal disciform scarring,
or evidence of previous AMD laser treatment.
Statistical Analysis
Prevalence was calculated as the ratio of the number of indi-
viduals with the condition to the total number of participants
who completed the clinical examination and had gradable
fundus photos. Prevalence estimates and 95% CIs were pre-
sented for the overall group and by age-specific groups.
Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel χ2 tests were used to evaluate the
trends and statistical differences in prevalence by sex and
age, with P < .05 considered significant. Age-standardized
prevalence was calculated by direct age standardization
using Asian population data from the 2010 US census6 to
compare prevalence across selected population-based stud-
ies. SAS, version 9.2 (SAS Institute Inc) was used to conduct
statistical analysis.
Results
Study Participants
Of 5782 eligible participants, 5429 (93.9%) individuals com-
pleted the home interview and 4582 (79.2%) also completed
the clinical examination. Gradable macular photographs were
obtained from 4172 (91.1%) of the participants who com-
pleted the clinical examination (72.2% of the total eligible
population) (Figure). A total of 401 participants who com-
pleted home interviews but did not undergo the clinical ex-
amination and those without at least 1 readable fundus pho-
tograph were excluded from further analyses.
Overall, the cohort in CHES primarily included 4523
(98.7%) first-generation immigrants, with most (3149 [68.7%])
born in mainland China. A total of 1526 (36.6%) participants
were men, and the mean (SD) age was 61.2 (8.8) years. CHES
participants were slightly younger (50-59 years) than Chi-
neselivinginCaliforniaortheUnitedStatesoverall(CHES,2180
[47.6%]; United States, 1 070 337 [44.0%]) and more likely to
be female (2901 [63.3%] and 1 264 944 [52.0%], respectively)6
but slightly less likely to have 12 or more years of education
(3090 [67.4%] and 1 873 090 [77.0%], respectively).
Participants in CHES clinical eye examination and non-
participants were similar in marital status, income, health and
visioninsurance,andhistoryofdiabetesmellitus,cataract,and
AMD. Compared with nonparticipants, the participants in the
analysis cohort were more likely to be female (2901 [63.3%]
vs 499 [58.8%]), slightly younger (mean age, 61.4 [9.3] vs 62.6
[11.0] years), more likely to have an education of 12 years or
more (3090 [67.4%] vs 491 [57.9%]), and more likely to
speak English (2695 [58.8%] vs 445 [52.5%]). These charac-
teristics did not differ substantially in participants and non-
participants with or without gradable photos (eTable 1 in the
Supplement).
Prevalence of AMD
Early and Advanced AMD
Reported as the percentage (95% CI) of the 4172 participants,
320 persons had evidence of any AMD (7.7% [6.9%-8.5%])
(Table 1 and eTable 2 in the Supplement). Of these, 306 per-
sons had early AMD (7.3% [6.5%-8.1%]) and 14 had advanced
AMD (0.3% [0.2%-0.5%]) (Table 1). Prevalence increased sig-
nificantly with increasing age of the participants (P < .001,

Of the 14 persons with late AMD, pure geographic atro-
phy was present in at least 1 eye in 2 male participants (14.3%
[95% CI, 2.0%-42.8%]). Neovascular AMD was the more com-
mon form of advanced AMD, identified in at least 1 eye in 12
participants (85.7% [95% CI 57.2%-98.2%]), of whom 8 were
men. The prevalence of advanced AMD was higher in older age
groups in men (P = .02); there was a similar pattern with
women(P = .002).Only50(15.6%)oftheindividualswithAMD
self-reported the condition. The prevalence of any AMD, early
AMD, and advanced AMD was identical in the 3852 partici-
pants who had gradable fundus photographs in both eyes. Bi-
lateral early AMD was present in 65 (7.4%) cases; only 3 (0.3%)
participants had bilateral advanced AMD.
Of the 320 cases of AMD, 8 (0.3% [95% CI, 0.0%-0.9%])
had evidence of visual impairment, defined as best-
corrected visual acuity in the better-seeing eye of Snellen-
measured 20/40 or worse. The primary cause of visual impair-
ment in these 8 patients was AMD (3 [37.5%]), cataract (4
[50.0%]), and myopic retinopathy (1 [12.5%]).

The prevalence of soft drusen was 33.7% in 1404 participants,

drusen (<63 μm in diameter) were the most common (Table 3
and eTable 4 in the Supplement). For those 70 years of age
and older, drusen between 63 and 124 μm in diameter were
most common. The overall prevalence of large drusen (≥125
μm in diameter) was 12.8% (not age adjusted). The frequency
of these large drusen was higher among older age groups.
There was no difference in the prevalence of various drusen
sizes between sexes after adjusting for age (P = .25).

RPE Abnormalities
We found RPE abnormalities in 4.7% of all participants (95%,
CI 4.0%-5.4%) (Table 4 and eTable 5 in the Supplement). The
prevalence of retinal pigment abnormalities ranged from 4.1%
in persons aged 50 to 59 years up to 7.2% in those 80 years or
older. The prevalence of increased retinal pigment abnormali-
ties and RPE depigmentation was higher in older age groups
for women (P < .05) only. Males were more likely than fe-
males to have any RPE abnormalities even after adjusting for
age (106 [6.8%] vs 88 [3.3%]; P < .001). Increased retinal pig-
ment abnormalities were seen more frequently than RPE de-
pigmentation in all age groups in both sexes (Table 4).
Comparison With Other Studies
A detailed comparison of age-specific and age-adjusted preva-
lence among similar population-based studies suggests that
the prevalence of early and advanced AMD in CHES partici-
pants was higher than that reported for Chinese residing in
northern China but lower than that in Chinese from Taiwan
(eTables 6-8 in the Supplement).
Discussion
To our knowledge, CHES is the largest and most comprehen-
sive population-based study of eye disease among people of
Chinese ancestry aged 50 years or older. The population-
based design and large sample size allowed calculation of pre-
cise prevalence estimates of AMD without being influenced by
referral patterns inherent in clinic-based studies. A major
strength of CHES is the use of standardized protocols to ob-
tain stereoscopic color photographs of the macula and the
masked grading process for AMD and its components.
Participation approaching 80% in CHES is reasonably high
compared with similar population-based studies (eg, Beaver
Dam Eye Study,14 83%; Baltimore Eye Survey,15 75%; and Shih-

pai Eye Study,11 66%). CHES is also larger than we had pre-
dicted given that the population is primarily first-generation,
immigrant Chinese individuals.
Although our participants differed slightly regarding age
and sex from eligible nonparticipants, the similarity of the
groups with respect to other demographic factors and eye con-
ditions suggests representativeness of the sample within age
and sex categories. We report both age- and sex-specific and
standardized estimates so that appropriate extrapolation or
comparison can be made across other populations.
The age-adjusted prevalence of early AMD was higher in
CHES (8.1%) than the prevalence of population-based studies
of Chinese, including the Beijing Eye Study10 (5.9%) and the
Handan Eye Study9 (4.6%). Prevalence was also higher in ev-
ery age strata in the Beijing Eye Study compared with the
Handan Eye Study, suggesting that the prevalence of AMD in
northern Chinese may vary within this region of China. Par-
ticipants in the Beijing Eye Study were a mix of rural and ur-
ban residents around Beijing, and participants in the Handan
EyeStudy(450milesfromBeijing)wereallruralresidents.This
geographic variance suggests that environmental or behav-
ioral factors related to urban living might be associated with
the prevalence of early AMD. This hypothesis may also ex-
plain the comparable prevalence of early AMD between CHES
and the Shihpai Eye Study of urban Chinese-Taiwanese per-
sons, with the authors11 also speculating that the lipid profile
and westernization of the diet may be associated with the
prevalence of AMD. Compared with other racial/ethnic groups,
age-adjusted prevalence of early AMD was lower in Chinese
American than in Latino individuals in the Los Angeles La-
tino Eye Study (LALES)5 and in non-Hispanic white individu-
als in the Beaver Dam Eye Study14 and the Baltimore Eye
Survey.15 The age-adjusted prevalence of early AMD was also
lower in Chinese Americans than in African descendants in the
Barbados Eye Study16 and the Baltimore Eye Survey15 but
higher than that seen in non-Hispanic white individuals in the
Blue Mountains Eye Study17 for every age strata. It is also likely
that the differences between CHES participants and non-
Hispanic white individuals in the Blue Mountains Eye Study
may be due to differences in the definition of early AMD.
In CHES, we found that the prevalence of both early and
advanced AMD was higher in men than in women, and this sex
difference remained after adjusting for age. The Handan Eye
Study,9 a population-based study in rural China, also found a
higher prevalence of AMD in men. In contrast to CHES and the
HandanEyeStudy,neithertheBeijingEyeStudy10northeShih-
pai Eye Study11 found a sex difference for early or advanced
AMD in the Chinese participants. Similar sex differences in
AMD prevalence were found in Latino individuals in LALES5
but not in non-Hispanic white individuals in the Blue Moun-
tain Eye Study17 and the Beaver Dam Eye Study.14 The cause
of this sex difference in the prevalence of AMD is unknown.
Although cigarette smoking is an important risk factor for
AMD18 and male Chinese Americans were more likely to smoke
thanwerefemaleChineseAmericans(35.3%vs2.9%;P < .001),
smoking cannot explain the sex difference in the prevalence
of AMD, as it remained substantial after adjusting for smok-
ing status. In addition, since non–AMD-related RPE pigmen-
tary changes were excluded from the analysis, the increased
prevalence of central serous retinopathy is unlikely to ex-
plain this higher prevalence in men.
Large drusen (≥125 μm diameter) are clinically important
lesions in early AMD and have been found in longitudinal in-
cidence studies19,20 to predict the occurrence of advanced
AMD. The age-specific prevalence of large drusen in CHES was
higher than that in the Beijing Eye Study10 but lower than that
in the Shihpai Eye Study11 (eTable 8 in the Supplement). The
trends of large drusen prevalence observed in CHES are lower
than those reported in Latinos in LALES5 but higher than most
reported14,17 prevalences for non-Hispanic whites. These dif-
ferences in the prevalence of large drusen may indicate that
AMD develops and progresses differently in various racial/
ethnic groups.
We observed a low prevalence of advanced AMD in CHES
(0.4%) in general (eTable 7 in the Supplement). The overall
prevalence in CHES is most similar to that of the Beijing Eye
Study10 (0.5%) but higher than that of the Handan Eye Study
(0.1%).9 Within CHES, the prevalence of advanced AMD
was higher with each subsequent age group, and a similar
trend is present in studies of northern Chinese9,10 and
Taiwanese-Chinese.11 The prevalence of advanced AMD ap-
pears to be noticeably higher in people aged 80 years or older
in the Shihpai Eye Study participants11; however, the preva-
lence should be interpreted cautiously because of the limited
sample size within that age category. In comparison with other
racial/ethnic groups (eTable 7 in the Supplement), Chinese
Americans in CHES had a prevalence of advanced AMD simi-
lar to that of African descendants in the Barbados Eye Study16
and the Baltimore Eye Survey15 but lower than that of Latino5
and non-Hispanic white individuals.14,15,17
In CHES, neovascular AMD was more prevalent (12 par-
ticipants [0.3%]) than geographic atrophy (2 [0.1%]), a ratio al-
mostidenticaltothatfoundinLatinoindividualsfromLALES.5
All 4 cases of advanced AMD in the Handan Eye Study9 and
19 of the 20 (95.0%) participants with advanced AMD in the
Shihpai Eye Study11 had neovascular AMD. The Beijing Eye
Study10 found almost a 1:1 ratio of geographic atrophy and neo-
vascular AMD, with 5 cases of each type of advanced AMD.
However, the small number of persons with advanced AMD
in most of these studies limits further interpretation of these
data.
The CHES cohort comprised primarily Mandarin-
speaking immigrants, 68.7% of whom were from mainland
China. Therefore, caution is warranted when extrapolating
these estimates to Chinese populations of different geosocial
or genetic background. Furthermore, age-standardized esti-
mates should be used to compare and infer about prevalence
differences across Chinese populations.
Conclusions
CHES provides data from what is, to our knowledge, the larg-
est and most comprehensive study of AMD prevalence among
people of Chinese ancestry aged 50 years or older. These data
suggest a higher prevalence of early and advanced AMD in

CHES participants than in Chinese from northern China but
lower prevalence than in Chinese from Taiwan. Similarly, the
prevalence of large drusen in CHES was higher than that
observed in North China and lower than that observed in
Taiwan. The differences in prevalence observed between
participants in CHES and other Chinese might indicate a
potential role for environmental factors in the development
and progression of AMD. The lower prevalence of both early
and advanced AMD in Chinese Americans in CHES, in com-
parison with Latino and non-Hispanic white individuals,
warrants further evaluation of behavioral, cultural, and
genetic risk factors.
