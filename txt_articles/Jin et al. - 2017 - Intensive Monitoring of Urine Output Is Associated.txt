BACKGROUND: Urine output (UO) is a vital sign for critically ill patients, but standards for
monitoring and reporting vary widely between ICUs. Careful monitoring of UO could lead to
earlier recognition of acute kidney injury (AKI) and better fluid management. We sought to
determine if the intensity of UO monitoring is associated with outcomes in patients with and
those without AKI.
METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study including 15,724 adults admitted to ICUs
from 2000 to 2008. Intensive UO monitoring was defined as hourly recordings and no gaps
> 3 hours for the first 48 hours after ICU admission.
RESULTS: Intensive monitoring for UO was conducted in 4,049 patients (26%), and we found
significantly higher rates of AKI (OR, 1.22; P < .001) in these patients. After adjustment for
age and severity of illness, intensive UO monitoring was associated with improved survival
but only among patients experiencing AKI. With or without AKI, patients with intensive
monitoring also had less cumulative fluid volume (2.98 L vs 3.78 L; P < .001) and less fluid
overload (2.49% vs 5.68%; P < .001) over the first 72 hours of ICU stay.
CONCLUSIONS: In this large ICU population, intensive monitoring of UO was associated with
improved detection of AKI and reduced 30-day mortality in patients experiencing AKI, as
well as less fluid overload for all patients. Our results should help inform clinical decisions
and ICU policy about frequency of monitoring of UO, especially for patients at high risk of
AKI or fluid overload, or both.

 Acute kidney injury (AKI) affects approximately
60% of critically ill patients and results in substantial
morbidity and mortality.1,2 Outcomes associated with
AKI remain poor despite improved awareness.3 One
reason for this is that early detection of AKI is difficult,
resulting in delays in evaluation, discontinuation of
nephrotoxins, and treatment of other precipitating
causes (eg, sepsis). A report from the National
Confidential Enquiry into Patient Outcomes and Death
from the United Kingdom showed that in 30% of
patients who died of AKI, the condition was
predictable and avoidable. In addition, only one-half of
those patients received “good care,” and many patients
did not have serum creatinine (SC) measurement or
calculation of urine output (UO).4
From the Acute Dialysis Quality Initiative
recommendations in 20045 to the most recent Kidney
Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO)
guideline in 2012,6 experts have recommended the
monitoring of UO and SC for patients at risk for AKI.
Creatinine and urine output are fundamental for
diagnosis, severity classification, and outcome prediction
in AKI, and there is increasing evidence that even small
elevations in SC may be associated with worse clinical
outcomes.7,8 Although many studies exclude UO criteria
when monitoring renal function because of the technical
difficulty of accurate collection and the complexity of
interpretation, we have recently shown that SC criteria
alone may miss about 20% of patients with AKI and may
result in misclassification of AKI severity.9
Whether intensive monitoring of SC and UO in
critically ill patients is associated with increased
detection of AKI and improved outcomes is not known.
In this study, we used a large intensive care database to
examine the risk of AKI and outcomes associated with
AKI in patients who had and those who did not have
intensive monitoring of SC and UO, defined as daily and
hourly, respectively.
Methods
Source Population
We analyzed data on 45,568 adult patients admitted to any of eight
ICUs at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center during an 8-
year period (from July 2000-October 2008). Details of the data
set are published elsewhere.10 For this study, we applied the
following exclusion criteria: (1) a history of chronic dialysis or
renal transplantation, or both (n ¼ 3,600); (2) a baseline serum
creatinine level $ 4 mg/dL (n ¼ 116); (3) an inability to
stage AKI in the 7 days after ICU admission (n ¼ 594);
(4) death within 48 hours of ICU admission (n ¼ 1,238); (5) ICU
stay < 48 hours (n ¼ 16,337); and (6) no vasopressor support or
mechanical ventilation in the 24 hours after ICU admission
(n ¼ 7,959). The remaining 15,724 patients composed the study
cohort (Fig 1).

 Data Collection
After obtaining Institutional Review Board approval (University of
Pittsburgh PRO15120160), we obtained data from the High-Density
Intensive Care (HiDenIC-8) database, which includes all patients
who were admitted to an ICU at the University of Pittsburgh
Medical Center from 2000 to 2008. HiDenIC-8 merges data from
several sources containing demographic data, diagnoses, billing
codes, laboratory results, surgical procedures, and various text
elements such as reports, clinical notes, and discharge summaries.
These data are combined with data from the Eclypsis database for
physiology
information,
which
includes
BP,
respiration
rate,
temperature, heart rate, medications, fluids, mechanical ventilation,
feeding,
oxygen,
details
of
renal
replacement
therapy,
and
transfusions. An honest broker also obtained information from the
US Renal Data System and the National Death Index and merged
these data with the HiDenIC-8 database. The final data set is
deidentified for use in analysis.
Study Cohorts
We stratified patients into two overlapping cohorts: those who received
UO monitoring and those who received SC monitoring. We further
subdivided each cohort into an intensive monitoring group and a
less intensive monitoring group. UO intensive monitoring was
defined as hourly recordings and no gaps of > 3 hours for the initial
48 hours after ICU admission, whereas less intensive UO monitoring
was defined as patients not meeting intensive monitoring criteria
regardless
of
UO
information
in
the
7
days
following
ICU
admission. SC intensive monitoring was defined as having 3 calendar
days of SC data (at least one measure per day) after ICU admission,
whereas less intensive SC monitoring was defined as patients not
meeting intensive monitoring criteria regardless of SC monitoring
availability in the 7 days following ICU admission. Comorbid
conditions
were
determined
by
International
Classification
of
Diseases, Ninth Revision codes. We designated patients as surgical or
medical based on the diagnosis-related group at hospital admission.
The acute physiology score (APS-III) was computed from electronic
abstraction of all physiological variables comprising the Acute
Physiologic and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) III score.11
Suspected sepsis was defined as a record of blood cultures and
antibiotics ordered within 24 hours of each other.10
Definitions and Outcomes
Baseline, admission, and reference SC values were determined as
previously described.12 We defined baseline creatinine as the lowest
value in the year prior to the index hospital admission. Admission
creatinine levels were the first creatinine value recorded for the index
hospital admission. Reference creatinine level was taken as the
baseline creatinine level when available; otherwise, it was the lowest
between admission creatinine level or creatinine level recorded in the
24 hours following ICU admission or (in patients without history of
CKD) estimated from the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease
equation for SC using a glomerular filtration rate of 75 mL/min/
1.73m2, as recommended in international guidelines.6 We classified
AKI according to the maximum Kidney Disease Improving Global
Outcomes criteria6 met during the 7 days after ICU admission using
both SC and UO criteria. For all analyses, we used moderate to
severe AKI defined as stage 2-3. For UO criteria, we required data at
least every 6 hours to stage AKI regardless of whether the patient
had intensive or nonintensive UO monitoring overall. We defined
fluid balance on the basis of total input/output divided by body
weight and expressed as a percentage. We defined fluid overload as
> 10% positive fluid balance. Primary comparisons were based on
the cumulative fluid balance and fluid overload over the first 72
hours of ICU stay.
Statistical Analyses
Statistical analyses were performed using Stata software, version SE 13.1
(Stata LP), with statistical significance set at P < .05. Survival graphs were
created using the R package “survival,” version 2.38-1 (R Project for
Statistical Computing). Comparisons across groups were performed
using the c2 asymptotic test or Fisher’s exact test for categorical
variables and the Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis of variance by ranks
for continuous variables. We used multivariable logistic regression to
identify risk factors associated with AKI development: by intensity of
UO and SC monitoring. The likelihood ratio test was used for model
selection, and Wald tests were used to assess the significance of each
risk factor retained in the final models. A Cox proportional hazards
model was used to assess the age and APS-III-adjusted survival at
30 days after ICU admission. In the survival model, the Breslow
method was used for ties, the likelihood ratio test was used to test the
overall statistical significance of the model, and Wald tests were used
to do pairwise comparisons between groups.
Results
Baseline Characteristics and Exposures
Of the 15,724 patients included in our study, 4,049
(25.8%) received intensive monitoring of UO compared
with 12,156 (77.4%) who received intensive monitoring
of SC (Fig 1). Baseline characteristics for patients
meeting and those not meeting UO and SC monitoring
criteria stratified by AKI (stage 2-3) are shown in
Tables 1 and 2, respectively. Baseline characteristics
(first 24 hours after ICU admission) were similar
between groups, with the exception of fluid
administered and vasopressor use (both greater in the
nonintensive monitoring group). There were no
clinically significant differences in reference creatinine
levels or APS-III scores between groups based on UO
monitoring.
Development of AKI
Crude rates of AKI (stage 2-3) by 7 days after ICU
admission were similar between UO monitoring groups
(intensive, 62.5% vs less intensive, 63.9%) and higher in
the intensive SC monitoring group (intensive,
65.5% vs less intensive, 56.7%). However, after adjusting
for baseline characteristics, intensive monitoring of UO
was associated with greater rates of AKI (OR, 1.22;
95% CI, 1.11-1.35; P < .001). In contrast, intensive
monitoring of SC was only marginally significant (OR,
1.11; 95% CI, 1.00-1.24; P ¼ .05) (Fig 2, e-Table 1,
e-Table 2).
Survival and Length of Stay
For patients experiencing AKI, in unadjusted analyses
intensive monitoring for UO was strongly associated

 with improved survival to 30 days compared with
patients with less intensive UO monitoring (hazard ratio
[HR], 0.85; 95% CI, 0.77-0.94; P ¼ .001). This difference
was also seen after adjusting for age and severity of
illness (HR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.81-0.99; P ¼ .04) (Fig 3,
Table 3). In contrast, for patients not experiencing AKI,

 intensive monitoring for UO was not associated with
improved survival when compared with patients with
less intensive UO monitoring (P ¼ .33). For SC in
unadjusted analyses, intensive monitoring in patients
experiencing AKI was associated with worse survival
compared with patients with less intensive monitoring
(HR, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.31-1.65; P < .001). However, this
relationship disappeared after adjusting for age and
APS-III (HR, 1.10; 95% CI, 0.98-1.24; P ¼ .11) (Table 3).
We found no association between intensity of UO
monitoring and ICU or hospital length of stay: median
8 days (5-15 days) in the ICU and 17 days (11-29 days)
in the hospital for patients with AKI. For patients
without AKI, ICU and hospital length of stay were
shorter: 5 days (4-10 days) and 14 days (9-24 days),
respectively, but were also not different by monitoring
intensity.
Process of Care for Patients With and Those
Without AKI
In an effort to better understand differences in
outcomes, we examined various process of care variables
for patients experiencing AKI or not stratified by UO
monitoring. Taking the cohort as a whole, patients
receiving intensive UO monitoring received less fluid in
the first 24 hours compared with patients receiving less
intensive UO monitoring: 3.6 L (2.5-5.1 L) vs 4.2 L (2.8-
6.5 L) (P < .001), respectively. These patients were also
less likely to receive vasopressors: 33.4% vs 49.8%;
P < .001. Over the first 72 hours of ICU stay, median
cumulative fluid balance was lower (2.98% vs 3.78%;
P < .001) and the proportion of patients with $
10% fluid overload was less (2.49% vs 5.68%; P < .001)
with intensive UO monitoring. When we restricted the
fluid overload analysis to those patients experiencing
AKI, we found that the median cumulative fluid balance
was again lower (3.17% vs 4.17%; P < .001) and the
proportion of patients at $ 10% fluid overload was again
less (2.97% vs 7.13%; P < .001) with intensive UO
monitoring.
Sensitivity Analyses
Our primary analysis used stage 2-3 AKI, so we explored
alternative thresholds for AKI severity—any stage AKI
or stage 3 AKI—and repeated our primary analysis
stratifying patients by these criteria. Our results were
unchanged for 30-day survival. Next, we examined the
results across different units and over the years included

 in the database. Results were generally consistent across
different ICUs and over different years, although the
reduced sample size resulted in nonsignificant results for
some individual units or some individual years. Finally,
we examined the proportion of patients meeting UO or
SC criteria, or both, for AKI stratified by intensity of UO
monitoring. The distribution was similar for patients
with and those without intensive monitoring, although
slightly more patients met AKI criteria using UO only
(and slightly fewer using both) with intensive UO
monitoring (e-Table 3).
Discussion
Treatment of AKI is focused on supportive care and
identification of the underlying cause. Both of these
priorities might be improved by earlier detection of
AKI and closer monitoring of kidney function. In a
small study, Udy et al13 found that more frequent
measurement of SC levels with the use of a point of care
test could increase detection of AKI. In another study,
Macedo et al14 found that diagnosis of AKI occurred
earlier in oliguric than in nonoliguric patients.
Similarly, Wlodzimirow et al15 compared the diagnosis
of AKI by UO criteria and SC criteria and found a
higher incidence of AKI using UO criteria (38%
vs 24%). A biopsy study found that 35% of patients
with parenchymal structural changes did not meet
KDIGO creatinine criteria for AKI,16 suggesting a
delayed rise in creatinine levels or “subclinical” AKI.
These prior studies lay a foundation of evidence to
suggest that delays in recognition of AKI are common.
If these delays can be mitigated by more intense
monitoring of UO, we hypothesize that outcomes may
be improved.
One possible mechanism by which intensive
monitoring of UO improves care and outcomes is
through better fluid management. As shown in
Table 1, for patients who experienced stage 2-3 AKI,
intensive monitoring of UO was associated with less
fluid administered during the first 24 hours of the ICU
stay compared with less intensive UO monitoring
(3.6 L vs 4.2 L; P < .001), despite having more weight-
adjusted urine output (17.5 mL/kg vs 15.4 mL/kg;
P < .001). As a result, cumulative fluid balance was
reduced; however, a component of the more favorable
fluid balance for patients receiving intensive UO
monitoring was due to the greater UO (eg, 150 mL/d
in a 70-kg patient). These findings suggest that
patients receiving intensive UO monitoring may have
been managed with a more conservative volume
resuscitation strategy, leading to less cumulative fluid
balance. Several studies have shown positive
associations between higher fluid balance and higher
mortality.17,18
However, patients receiving intensive UO monitoring
were also less likely to receive vasopressors
(29.9% vs 43.3%; P < .001), and this difference was seen
in both patients experiencing AKI (33.4% vs 49.8%) and
those who did not (23.9% vs 31.8%). This suggests that
contrary to expectations, patients not receiving intensive
UO monitoring were more hemodynamically unstable
compared with patients who did.
Two factors may contribute to reduced measurement
and recording of UO. First, measurement of UO is
tedious, and accurate hourly UO calculation is
sometimes difficult to achieve. Second, there has been a
concerted effort in many (if not most) ICUs to
discontinue Foley catheter use as early as possible. We
do not know what effect these efforts may be having on
the intensity of UO monitoring.
Our study has important limitations. First, despite the
large sample size, the patients were all from a single
medical center, and thus our results may not be

 generalizable to all ICUs. However, our overall event
rates and outcomes agree well with recent epidemiologic
studies of AKI.19,20 Second, SC and UO values were
obtained as part of clinical practice and may provide
some ascertainment bias. Our results apply only to
critically ill patients as defined by the use of vasopressors
or mechanical ventilation. Finally, like other
observational studies, we may have potential
confounding from unknown variables, which may alter
the relationship between intensity of monitoring and
outcomes.
Conclusions
In conclusion, the intensity of UO monitoring is
associated with increased detection of moderate to
severe AKI and reduced incidence of fluid overload and
is independently associated with reduced 30-day
mortality in patients experiencing AKI. In contrast,
intensive monitoring of SC showed no effect on 30-day
mortality associated with AKI. Our results should help
inform clinical decisions and ICU policy about the
frequency of monitoring of UO, especially for patients at
high risk of AKI.
