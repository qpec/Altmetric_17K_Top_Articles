Abstract
Background: Life expectancy has been increasing steadily over the past century in most countries, with only a few
exceptions such as during wartimes.
Discussion: Marked reversal of life expectancy has been linked to substance use and related policies. Three such
examples are discussed herein, namely the double reversal of life expectancy trends (first to positive, then to negative)
associated with reducing alcohol supply in the then Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR), followed by a rapid
increase in availability; the impact of the rapid increase of prescription opioids on white non-Hispanics in the US; and
the systemic impact of the violence accompanying the drug war in Mexico on the life expectancy of men.
Alcohol policies were crucial to initiate the positive reversal in the USSR, and different substance use policies
could have avoided the negative impacts on life expectancy of the described large groups or nations.
Summary: Substance use policies can be responsible for abrupt negative changes in life expectancies. An orientation
of such policies towards the goals of public health and societal well-being can help avoid such changes.
Keywords: Life expectancy, Marked reversals of trend, Substance use, Policy, Public health
Background
Life expectancy has increased steadily over the past cen-
tury, except during mass pandemics, such as the influenza
pandemic of 1918/1919, or during World Wars I and II
[1–3] (see also: http://vizhub.healthdata.org/le/ accessed
March 3, 2016). For most countries, the upward trend has
remained uninterrupted since the end of World War II.
These gradual upward transitions of life expectancy are
based on an environment composed of a complex inter-
play of a variety of major risk and protective factors [4],
with the balance improving steadily in the overwhelming
majority of countries [1–3]. Tobacco, alcohol, and illicit
drug use are part of these environments; all three categor-
ies of substances are among the top 20 risk factors glo-
bally, with most of the burden of disease and mortality
attributable to tobacco followed by alcohol, with drugs as
a distant third [4]. Thus, substance use has been known to
have a negative impact on life expectancy and burden of
disease, but usually these impacts are counterbalanced by
more positive impact factors.
Abrupt changes of directions in life expectancy have
been rare, usually triggered by reversal of mortality rates
in mid-adulthood, and linked to specific events, such as
the aforementioned pandemic or wartimes [3]. However,
substance use policies can also create sudden or relatively
abrupt population impacts, as will be illustrated herein
with three examples.
Examples of marked reversals of life expectancy
linked to substance use policies
One, almost classic, example for abrupt reversals in life
expectancy relates to the changes associated with the
alcohol reforms of the Union of Soviet Socialist Repub-
lics in the Gorbachev era, which reversed a negative
trend in life expectancy into a positive one following a
reduction in the supply of alcohol (increase in life ex-
pectancy from 1984 to 1987: men, 3.2 years; women,

 1.3 years [5, 6]). When the restrictive alcohol policy
was abandoned and alcohol became widely available,
the trend in life expectancies reverted once again (de-
crease in life expectancy between 1987 and 1994: men,
7.3 years; women, 3.3 years [5, 7]). Obviously, these
figures represent associations between availability and
consumption of alcohol with life expectancy rather than
a proof of causality, however, at least for the first rever-
sal, it would be hard to find other explanations, as the
increases in life expectancy occurred during a time of
economic crisis with no plausible alternative explana-
tions. For the negative trend reversal, attribution of
causality is less clear, as this change took place in a period
of massive privatization (e.g. [8]) and economic decline,
with resulting unemployment (e.g. [9, 10]), community
destabilization, subsequent psychological stress (e.g. [11]),
and increasing inequality [12]. Some of these variables
were included in the most comprehensive econometric
modeling on the Russian experience of rapidly decreasing
life expectancy [7]. Moreover, alcohol-attributable causes
of death were especially impacted in both reversals for life
expectancy [5, 7]. Finally, more recent examples of the
effects of alcohol policies on mortality confirmed the
importance of alcohol policies in the Russian case [13, 14].
In terms of mechanisms, the underlying policy interven-
tions to reduce mortality were mainly alcohol availability
restrictions and taxation [5, 13], the latter only for more
recent interventions.
The second example concerns drug policy, and specif-
ically policies for regulating prescription opioids (POs)
in the United States (US). Overall, larger quantities of
POs are used in the US than in any other country (in
the latest available statistic for 2011–2013, Canada was a
distant second, with about 60 % of the consumption per
capita of the US [15]). The rapid increase of PO use and
misuse commenced in the mid-1990s, in part by allow-
ing family doctors to prescribe short-acting opioids like
oxycodone for relatively common disease categories such
as chronic pain [16, 17]. With increased availability of
POs, non-medical use increased proportionally along with
their associated harm, such as overdose deaths (albeit with
some lag) [16, 18–20], contributing to a reversal of all-
cause mortality of middle-aged white non-Hispanics in
the US [21]. While the mortality trend for the general
population was steadily decreasing prior to 1999, between
1999 and 2013 mortality increased by 9 % in white
non-Hispanics, but continued to decrease in black non-
Hispanics and Hispanics. Again, this is an association, but
the increase in mortality for white non-Hispanic middle
aged Americans was largely accounted for by increasing
death rates from drug and alcohol poisoning deaths, sui-
cide, and chronic liver diseases and cirrhosis, all directly
or indirectly associated with substance use and substance
use policies (drug and alcohol poisoning deaths per
definition; suicide [22]; liver cirrhosis [23]; causal links for
illicit drugs in general [24]). POs played the major role in
this mortality mix, as prescription overdose deaths have
become the most prevalent form of overdose death in the
past decade in North America, accounting for approxi-
mately 40 % of the total drug poisoning deaths [25–27].
The rise in heroin overdose deaths in recent years can also
be partly attributed to use initiated by way of previous PO
use [28].
The third example, also arising from illicit drug pol-
icies, relates to the systemic consequences of substance
use policies (for a definition see [29]). A recent paper
showed that, after six decades of gains in life expectancy
for Mexico, the trend stagnated for the period following
the year 2000 and, for men after 2005, it actually reversed
[30]. This reversal of trends in life expectancy was mainly
caused by an unprecedented rise in homicide rates, in
large part linked to illicit drugs and the war on drugs, i.e.
linked to gang wars and/or conflicts between drug gangs
and police or the army [31]. In general, enforcement of
prohibitive drug laws has been shown to impact adversely
on drug market violence in a systematic review of the
evidence [32], and alternative regulatory models will be
required if drug supply and drug market violence are to be
meaningfully reduced [33].
Conclusions
These examples are chosen to demonstrate that changes
in substance use, unlike changes in other risk factors,
can affect population life expectancy not only in the long
term but also abruptly, reversing decade-long trends. As
shown, this is even true for illicit drugs, which have been
linked to much less overall mortality and burden of dis-
ease than legal substances such as alcohol and tobacco
(see above and [4]). The cases cited represent dramatic
changes in policies and use patterns, where the connec-
tions with overall disease burden are striking. However,
there is also ample evidence that appropriate incremental
changes in policy or their enforcement have had effects on
health outcomes [34, 35].
The health impact in the dramatic cases cited above
show that substance use policy decisions can have sub-
stantial effects on the burden of disease if policymakers
get it wrong; however, they also point to potential sub-
stantial benefits if policymakers get it right, i.e. if they
establish policies associated with a positive impact on
population well-being and the burden of disease, including
mortality [33]. Several principles have been identified to
allow for such a positive transformation:
� There should be active monitoring of substance-
attributable disease burden and mortality. Identifying
rapid changes in substance-attributable causes of
death above a certain size will prepare the way for

 adequate policy changes (see [36], as example for
alcohol).
� Active and integrated substance use policies should
be created, oriented at public health gains as a major
goal, and with decriminalization of substance use
[33, 37] (see also the UNAIDS recommendations
for the United Nations General Assembly Special
Session on the World Drug Problem [38]).
Substance use policies must include legal and illegal
substances and psychoactive medications, as
evidenced by the second example [35]. The public
health approach explicitly includes considerations
about harm to others attributable to substance use
(i.e. second-hand smoke, effects of substance use
on road traffic and operating machinery, violence,
effects on the family).
� Regulation of availability of substances, including
regulation of affordability, is one of the cornerstones
for substance use policies (see above and [34, 35, 39]).
� Trade agreements and dispute mechanisms – global,
regional, and bilateral – need to be changed so that
market restrictions on legally traded psychoactive
substances for public health purposes cannot be
challenged or nullified [40, 41].
� Access to treatment and social assistance for heavy
users and their families should be improved, which
needs to be linked to a reduction of stigmatization.
Substance use disorders are the least treated mental
conditions, and mental conditions as a whole are
less treated than somatic conditions [42]. Improving
access to treatment and social assistance would also
help in achieving the UN sustainable development
goal, specific target 3.5, asking for a strengthening of
“prevention and treatment of substance abuse” [43].
� Policy responses should be relative to the potential
of substances to reduce well-being, including, but not
limited to, burden of disease and mortality [33, 44].
