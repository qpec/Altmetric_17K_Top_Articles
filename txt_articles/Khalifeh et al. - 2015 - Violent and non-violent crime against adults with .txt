 Violence experienced by people with severe mental illness (SMI) is
associated with poor symptomatic and functional recovery, high
rates of comorbid post-traumatic stress disorder and poor treatment
adherence.1–4 Violence prevention is a current public health
priority5,6 but little is known about whether violence against
people with SMI differs substantially (in terms of nature, impact
and reporting of crime) from violence against the general
population. In order to address this gap in knowledge, we
conducted a detailed comparative study of the prevalence and
impact of violent and non-violent crime among people with
SMI. Our primary hypothesis was that, compared with members
of the general population, people with SMI would be at increased
risk of being victims of personal and household crime, after taking
into account sociodemographic confounders. Secondary hypotheses
were that (a) the elevated risk of violent victimisation would be
accounted for by social deprivation, substance misuse and violence
perpetration, (b) victims with SMI would be more likely to
experience adverse psychological and social sequelae than victims
without SMI, and (c) victims with SMI would be less likely to
report victimisation to professionals than victims without SMI.
Method
Design
In this cross-sectional study, we recruited people with SMI under
the care of mental health services and interviewed them using a
modified version of the Crime Survey for England and Wales
(CSEW) questionnaire. We compared findings from our patient
sample with findings from participants in the contemporaneous
Office for National Statistics (ONS) crime victimisation survey
(the CSEW); a nationally representative survey of adults living
in private residential household in England and Wales.7
Setting and participants
Patients with SMI (the patient group) were recruited from two
NHS mental health trusts, South London & Maudsley and
Camden & Islington, that cover a large diverse catchment area
of 1.5 million people living in one of six London boroughs. In this
study, SMI is defined in terms of chronicity and need for intensive
care from secondary mental healthcare services, and includes
people with psychotic disorders (such as schizophrenia or bipolar
disorder), as well as those with other diagnoses (for example
depression or personality disorder) of a severity requiring
intensive service contact. This is in accordance with UK
Department of Health definitions.8 Using central information
technology registers, we identified all patients in receipt of
ongoing care by a named keyworker in 19 community teams in
these
trusts,
and
selected
a
simple
random
sample
for
participation. Inclusion criteria for the patient sample were (a)
age 18–65, (b) under the care of community mental health teams
in one of six London boroughs (Camden, Islington, Southwark,
Lambeth, Croydon, Lewisham) for 1 year or more, and (c) living
in the community. The exclusion criteria were (a) poor English
language proficiency, (b) lacking capacity to consent (and not
recovering this capacity over the study course), and (c) unavailable
to participate (for example abroad, in prison). As stipulated by the
ethics committee, patients were not approached directly but were
recruited via their care coordinators. We summarised the study to
care coordinators and provided them with patient information
sheets. We checked with them the eligibility of patients from
our random list who were on their caseload. Care coordinators
gave eligible patients a patient information sheet and asked their
permission for a researcher to contact them. Patients who granted
permission were contacted by a researcher, who answered any
queries they had about the study and sought their written consent
to participate in the study. Those who provided written consent
were interviewed at a time and place that suited them.
The ONS survey recruited a nationally representative random
sample of people living in private residential households in
England and Wales (the control group).7 The inclusion criteria
for the comparison sample were (a) participants in the 2011/
2012 CSEW, (b) resident in any of London’s 32 boroughs, and

Background
Little is known about the relative extent of crime against
people with severe mental illness (SMI).
Aims
To assess the prevalence and impact of crime among people
with SMI compared with the general population.
Method
A total of 361 psychiatric patients were interviewed using the
national crime survey questionnaire, and findings compared
with those from 3138 general population controls
participating in the contemporaneous national crime survey.
Results
Past-year crime was experienced by 40% of patients v. 14%
of controls (adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 2.8, 95% CI 2.0–3.8);
and violent assaults by 19% of patients v. 3% of controls
(adjusted OR = 5.3, 95% CI 3.1–8.8). Women with SMI had
four-, ten- and four-fold increases in the odds of
experiencing domestic, community and sexual violence,
respectively. Victims with SMI were more likely to report
psychosocial morbidity following violence than victims from
the general population.
Conclusions
People with SMI are at greatly increased risk of crime and
associated morbidity. Violence prevention policies should be
particularly focused on people with SMI.

 (c) aged 18–65. We excluded controls with self-reported chronic,
disabling mental illness. This study was approved by the Kent
Local Research Ethics Committee. Written informed consent was
obtained from all patients who participated in the study.
Interview procedures
The ONS national crime survey was conducted by lay interviewers
in participants’ homes.9 It comprised (a) a face-to-face interview,
which focused on being a victim of personal or household crime
in the past year, and (b) an opt-in self-completion questionnaire
for those aged 18–59, which focused on the more sensitive topics
of domestic violence, sexual violence, substance misuse and
violence perpetration. The self-completion module is typically
taken up by 70% of eligible respondents.9
We modified the ONS survey questionnaire for use with our
patient population, mainly by omitting optional modules outside
the scope of our research question. The patient survey was
conducted by one of six interviewers (three psychologists, one
psychiatrist and two research assistants) in either a clinical setting
(86%) or in the participant’s home (14%), depending on
participant choice. One interviewer from each site attended
ONS CSEW interviewer training and instructed the others, in
order to keep interview procedures as similar to the ONS survey
as possible.
Measures
The primary exposure was SMI (as defined by the patient
inclusion criteria above; namely chronic mental disorder requiring
ongoing secondary mental healthcare). The primary outcome was
being a victim of violent or non-violent crime in the past year
among those aged 18–65, as disclosed in the face-to-face interview.
Following CSEW definitions, ‘crime’ referred to experiences
disclosed by participants, whether or not they were reported to
the police. Personal crime was defined as (a) any physical or sexual
assault, (b) personal acquisitive crime (robbery, attempted
robbery, theft from the person, theft of personal belongings).
Household crime was defined as (a) criminal damage, (b) house-
hold acquisitive crime (burglary or attempted burglary, theft from
household).
The key secondary outcome was being a victim of any physical
or sexual violence in the past year among those aged 18–59, as
disclosed in either the face-to-face interview or self-completion
module. This included domestic violence (perpetrated by partners
or family members) and community violence (perpetrated by
strangers or acquaintances).
The following additional outcomes of interest were limited to
people who reported being victims of violence in the face-to-face
interviews: (a) impact of violent crime, measured by asking
victims whether they had reported one or more of the following
as a result of victimisation: depression, anxiety or panic attacks; loss
of confidence; relationship breakdowns; financial loss; time off work;
physical illness; injury, (b) reporting of violent crime to the police
and satisfaction with police response, (c) among the patient group,
reporting to mental health professionals and unmet needs.
Potential confounders, identified a priori from the literature,
were: age, gender, ethnicity, marital status, living alone, employment,
housing tenure, small area multiple deprivation index (MDI; a
composite measure of deprivation in administratively defined
areas of around 1500 residents) and output area characteristics
(OAC, whereby areas are classified by census-derived socio-
demographic characteristics). Potential explanatory factors were
substance misuse and violence perpetration. The National Crime
Survey has four modules that are each asked of a random quarter
of the sample in order to decrease interviewee burden, and the
violence perpetration questions were included in one of these
modules, so data on this measure were only available for a random
quarter of general population participants.
For the patient group, we obtained clinical information from
clinical records and/or care coordinators where patients consented
to this. Clinical diagnosis was defined as the primary ICD-10
diagnosis10 given in the clinical records.
Statistical analysis
We used Hsieh’s methods to estimate sample size (a widely used
method for estimating sample sizes for logistic regression).11 To
detect a three-fold excess risk of any victimisation among patients
(at the 5% significance level, with a power of 80%), we estimated
that we needed 270 patients and 1080 controls.
To address our primary hypothesis, we used multivariate
logistic regression to estimate odds ratios for crime victimisation
in those with and without SMI, adjusting for the potential
confounders listed above (see Table 3 for details of covariates).
We tested for a gender interaction in the association between
SMI and victimisation. To address our secondary hypothesis on
violence victimisation, we estimated the odds for this outcome
stratified by gender. We entered covariates in three sequential
blocks for demographics, social
deprivation and substance
misuse/violence perpetration, to explore to what extent these
domains accounted for any excess victimisation risk (see Tables
4 and 5 for details on covariates). To address our secondary
hypotheses on impact and disclosure, we estimated the relative
odds of these outcomes among violence victims with and without
SMI, adjusting for victim and crime characteristics (see Table 6 for
details).
We conducted a sensitivity analysis estimating the adjusted odds
for victimisation among patients and a comparison subgroup
matched on borough of residence (restricted to controls who lived
in the six London boroughs from which patients were recruited)
(online Table DS1). We also conducted a subgroup analysis by
diagnosis, comparing patients with schizophrenia and those with
other diagnoses v. the control group (online Table DS2). Where
there were missing data on more than 5% for a secondary
outcome, we described the distribution of missing data across
the patient and control groups, and carried out sensitivity analyses
to explore potential bias.
Results
Sample flow and characteristics
We recruited patients from 19 community mental health teams.
Of 1099 patients randomly selected from the care programme
approach (CPA) registers for these teams, 697 (63%) were eligible
for this study, of whom 361 (52%) completed the survey from
September 2011 to March 2013 (Fig. 1). For the control group
we used data from the CSEW conducted from April 2011 to April
2012 (the most recently available CSEWdata), with a response rate
of 68% for London residents.7 Of the 3224 CSEW participants
aged 18–65 living in London, 3138 met our control inclusion
criteria, after excluding 86 participants (2.7%) who reported
disabling mental illness. Data on domestic violence from self-
completion modules was available for 85% (292/345) of the
patient group and 74% (2092/2812) of the control group aged
18–59.
The sample sociodemographics are shown in Table 1. People
with SMI had greater levels of social deprivation than the
comparison group. The clinical characteristics of the patient
group are shown in Table 2. Around 60% had a diagnosis of

Mental Health Act.
Crime victimisation: face-to-face interview measures
Table 3 shows the prevalence and odds ratios for victimisation
experiences reported in the face-to-face interview (adjusted for
sociodemographics). The experience of being a victim of any
crime was more prevalent among the patient than the control
group (40% v. 14%, respectively; adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 2.8,
95% CI 2.0–3.8). In total, 26% of the patient group v. 7% of
the control group were victims of any personal crime (adjusted
OR = 3.0, 95% CI 2.1–4.4) and 23% v. 9% were victims of any
household crime (adjusted OR = 2.9, 95% CI 2.1–4.0). Those in
the patient group were at increased adjusted odds of being a
victim of assault (adjusted OR = 5.3, 95% CI 3.1–8.8), household
acquisitive crime (adjusted OR = 2.7, 95% CI 1.9–3.8) and
criminal damage (adjusted OR = 3.4, 95% CI 1.8–6.3); but not of
personal acquisitive crime (adjusted OR= 1.4, 95% CI 0.83–2.4).
There was an interaction by gender for assault, where adjusted
odds ratios for women with SMI compared with control women
was 12.0 (95% CI 5.4–26.5), and adjusted odds ratios for men
with SMI compared with control men was 3.0 (95% CI 1.5–6.0,
P for interaction 0.02).
The results of the sensitivity analysis, which compared the
patient and control groups residing in the same boroughs, are
reported in online Table DS1 and broadly reflect the findings
above.
The

analyses,
which
compared
general
population controls with (a) people with schizophrenia and (b)
those with other diagnoses, show somewhat lower relative odds
for those with schizophrenia, but confidence intervals were
overlapping for most outcomes (online Table DS2).

Physical and sexual assaults: face-to-face interview
and self-completion measures
Table 4 shows the prevalence and odds ratios for assaults reported
in either the face-to-face interview or self-completion module, by
gender. The prevalence of any past-year physical or sexual violence
in the patient v. control group was 27% v. 5% for women and 23%
v. 5% for men. The odds for any violence victimisation, adjusted
for sociodemographics and substance misuse, were 6.4 (95% CI
3.1–13.1) among women and 2.7 (95% CI 1.2–5.8) among men.
Women with SMI were at increased adjusted odds of all subtypes
of violent victimisation; including domestic physical violence
(OR = 3.5,
95%
CI
1.3–9.7),
community
physical
violence
(OR = 10.3, 95% CI 3.4–31.7) and sexual violence (OR = 3.7,
95% CI 1.1–11.8). Men were at increased risk of being a victim
of domestic physical violence (OR = 3.9, 95% CI 1.03–15.2), but
their risk of community physical violence was not elevated at
the 5% significance level (OR = 2.2, 95% CI 0.9–5.3). The absolute
number of men reporting sexual violence was too small to allow
for stable estimates.
The effect of adjusting for different risk factors on the association
between SMI and violence victimisation is shown in Table 5. Adjust-
ment for social deprivation resulted in little change in the magnitude
of this association, whereas additional adjustment for substance
misuse and violence perpetration led to a sizeable reduction. After
taking into account sociodemographics, substance misuse and
violence perpetration, the adjusted odds of violence victimisation
was 1.9 (95% CI 0.53–6.8) among men and 7.7 (95% CI 2.5–23.7)
among women. Therefore, these factors accounted for the excess
risk among men but not among women with SMI.
Impact, reporting and unmet needs among
victims of violent crime
A quarter to half of victims in the patient group reported adverse
psychosocial effects as a result of victimisation, and 80% reported

c. There was interaction by gender for assaults only, where adjusted odds ratio (OR) for women was 12.0 (95% CI 5.4–26.5) and for men 3.0 (95% CI 1.5–6.0). The prevalence among female
patients and controls was 20.2 (95% CI 14.0–26.5) v. 2.2 (95% CI 1.5–2.9), respectively; and among male patients and controls 17.7 (95% CI 12.5–23.0) v. 3.5 (95% CI 2.4–4.4), respectively.
d. Although only one adult per household was interviewed, ‘household crime’ was defined as crime experienced by any household member, hence odds ratios for these outcomes
were not adjusted for personal characteristics of the respondent.
 Violent and non-violent crime against adults with severe mental illness
physical injury (Table 6). Victims in the patient group were more
likely to report that violence led to social problems, adverse psycho-
logical effects (depression, anxiety or panic attacks) and injury than
victims in the control group; with four- to five-fold higher odds for
the latter two after adjusting for victim and crime characteristics.
There was no difference in the proportion reporting financial loss
or physical ill health following violence experiences.
Victimisation was reported to the police for 58% of victims in
the patient group and 49% of victims in the control group
(P = 0.72), with no difference in reporting, even after adjusting for
victim and crime characteristics. Patients were more dissatisfied with
the police response (50% v. 24%, P= 0.02), but this difference was
no longer statistically significant at the 5% level after adjusting
for victim/crime characteristics. The same conclusions were
reached following a sensitivity analysis; conducted to explore
non-response bias, since there was unequal missing data between
patients and controls on these outcomes (Table 6). Among the
patient group who were victims of violence, 68% reported their
experiences to a mental health professional. A total of 55% had
unmet support needs; with around a third reporting an unmet
need for ‘talking help’
, help with the Criminal Justice System process
or practical/financial support.

Discussion
Main findings
This study compared the prevalence and correlates of violent and
non-violent crime victimisation among people with SMI with a
general population control group, and compared impact and
disclosure of victimisation. In total, 40% of the patient group
compared with 14% of the control group were victims of a crime
in the preceding year. Our primary hypothesis that patients would
be at increased odds of personal and household crime compared
with the general population controls was supported; those in
the patient group were five times more likely to be victims of
assault, and three times more likely to be victims of household
acquisitive crime and criminal damage, after adjusting for
sociodemographics and area characteristics. Women with SMI
were at particularly high risk of violence, both community and
domestic. Our secondary hypothesis that social deprivation,
substance misuse and violence perpetration would account for
any excess risk of violence victimisation among patients was
supported among men with SMI but not among women with
SMI (who had eight-fold adjusted odds). Our secondary hypotheses
on impact and reporting of crime were partially supported: crime
led to greater reported psychological adversity and injury by the
victims in the patient group than those in the control group,
but surprisingly patients and controls were equally likely to report
victimisation to the police.
Findings in the context of past studies
Previously published studies on violence victimisation among
people
with
SMI
have had
highly
heterogeneous
settings,
populations and measures and have reported prevalence estimates
ranging from 4% to 58%.12–16 Few studies have compared
victimisation among mental health service users with a control
group.17–21 Silver in the USA compared discharged psychiatric
patients with a neighbourhood control sample, and found a
two-fold increase in violence victimisation after adjusting for
sociodemographics and violence perpetration.19 Teplin et al in
the USA and Sturup et al in Sweden compared violent crime
against psychiatric patients with data from participants in national
crime surveys and after adjusting for a very limited number of
confounders found 12-fold and 6-fold higher risk among patients,
respectively.18,21 Finally, a New Zealand birth cohort found that
violent victimisation among a small number of people with
schizophreniform disorder (n = 38) was three-fold higher than
among those without any psychiatric disorder.20 The studies
adjusted for a limited number of confounders and did not assess
the impact or reporting of violence. Some past studies measured
and reported on victimisation by any perpetrators, including
partners and family members,18 but this is one of the few studies
to report separately on domestic violence (perpetrated by partners
and family members) and community violence (perpetrated by
strangers or acquaintances). This is important, since these forms
of violence have distinct interventions.22 We found greatly
elevated odds of victimisation compared with our general
population control group for all violence types (physical and sexual;
domestic and community), even after adjusting for a broader
range of key individual, household and area characteristics than
in studies carried out previously.18–21
Our finding that women with SMI were particularly
vulnerable to violence is consistent with evidence from Sweden
and
the
USA.18,21,23
In
the
general
population,
violence
prevention among women is focused on domestic and sexual
violence,24,25 but our finding that women with SMI had increased
risks for both domestic and community violence suggests the need
for broader interventions in this group.
We found that people with SMI are more likely to report
adverse psychological and social effects once victimised. This
would compound the personal, public health and economic costs
of victimisation in this group, especially given the relatively large
contribution of psychosocial impact to the overall economic cost
of crime.26 These findings suggest that people with SMI should be
prioritised in public health policies on violence prevention
directed at vulnerable groups. Although SMI is uncommon,
affecting around 3% of the population,27 it is one of the leading
causes of global disease burden; and this study and others suggest
that experiencing violence is associated with worse function and
quality of life among this group.28
Past studies have shown that substance misuse, social
isolation, homelessness and violence perpetration are important
risk factors for victimisation among people with SMI;13,29,30
whereas treatment adherence was protective.31 In our study,
substance misuse and violence perpetration accounted for the
excess risk of victimisation among men but not among women;
suggesting the need for gender-sensitive interventions given the
likely differences in risk pathways.
In routine clinical practice, victimisation is underdetected by
mental health professionals, and where it is detected, concerns
may not be promptly acted upon.32 Half of the violence victims
in
our
study
had
unmet
support
needs.
Mental
health
professionals need to identify victimisation, mitigate modifiable
risk factors and address comorbidity.
Surprisingly, patients were as likely to report victimisation to
the police and to progress through the Criminal Justice System as
the
general
population,
contradicting
previous
qualitative
evidence that suggested people with mental health problems had
limited access to the judicial system.33 Nonetheless, those in the
patient group were less likely to be satisfied with the response of
the police, with qualitative research conducted by the UK Charity
Victim Support suggesting that they are often not believed and
discriminated against within the Criminal Justice System.34
Clearly criminal justice policies must protect against such
discrimination. Half of patients had unmet support needs,
including for practical/financial help, psychological support and
help with the Criminal Justice System process.
Strengths and limitations
Strengths of this study include a large sample size, with a
comparison group drawn from the same geographical area. We
derived detailed information on the nature, impact and reporting
of crime, and used self-reported measures for domestic and sexual
violence (which have higher disclosure rates than interview
measures).35 The response rate was somewhat low at 52%.
However, the study researched a sensitive topic, in a population
which may have additional barriers to participating in such a
study. Although domestic and sexual violence are sensitive topics
for any group, they may be even more sensitive and complex for
patients with SMI in secondary mental healthcare to discuss, since
patients may worry about additional consequences of disclosure
such as involuntary hospital admission.34 We used a rigorous
random sampling procedure, using a complete list of all patients
on the caseload of included teams, whether or not they were
actively engaged in treatment. As stipulated by the ethics
committee, we recruited indirectly via care coordinators rather
than through direct contact with patients. These factors may
explain the lower response rate in this study compared with those
using a convenience sample17,36 or direct recruitment of patients
attending out-patient or in-patient services.18 Non-responders
280
 Violent and non-violent crime against adults with severe mental illness
had the same demographic profile (in terms of age and gender)
as participants. We did not have additional details on the
characteristics of non-responders, so it is difficult to comment
on the likely magnitude and direction of non-response bias. We
speculate that some patients may have failed to respond because
they had experienced or were experiencing violence and were
worried about the consequences of disclosure (for example
increased violence or coercive treatment), which would have
led to an underestimate of violence prevalence. Others may have
failed to respond because they did not have past experiences
of violence and so did not perceive this study as relevant to
them, which would have led to an overestimate of violence
experiences. The overall effect is difficult to ascertain, but the
odds ratios are sizeable and unlikely to be fully explained by
non-response bias.
The findings have external validity, mirroring those of related
studies in the USA and Sweden.18,21 There is potential for observer
bias (since interviewers in the patient survey were not masked to
the main hypothesis) and reporting bias (the patient and control
groups may have different thresholds for disclosing victimisation),
but this is mitigated by the highly structured questionnaire, and
there is evidence that self-reported victimisation among people
with SMI is valid and reliable.18,37,38 There may be a reporting bias
for domestic violence because of the different interview settings –
the controls were interviewed at home but most patients were
interviewed in clinic, and disclosure may be easier in a clinical
setting (although all home-based interviews were conducted in a
private setting without others present, and participants themselves
filled out a computer-based questionnaire in confidence).
Another limitation is the different sociodemographic profile
of the patient and control groups, but we carefully adjusted for
a broad range of individual and household measures. Our
sensitivity analysis found no evidence for confounding by area
of residence. Bias from missing data on impact is possible, but
there was no evidence for this from our sensitivity analysis. A
small proportion of the control group may have an SMI, since
we used a self-reported measure to exclude mental illness in this
group. However, the prevalence of SMI in the general population
is less than 3%,27 and the presence of people with SMI in the
control group would have led us to underestimate the relative
odds. Findings on prevalence are likely to generalise to other
Western
urban
settings
with
similar
background
levels of
violence, and those on the relative risk of victimisation are likely
to generalise to settings where people with SMI have a similar
sociodemographic and clinical profile to the one described here.
In conclusion, victimisation among people with SMI is more
prevalent and associated with greater psychosocial morbidity than
victimisation among the general population. Our research has
shown that women with SMI are at particularly high risk of both
domestic and community violence. Violence prevention for
people with SMI is likely to require an integrated response by
mental health professionals, third-sector organisations and the
Criminal Justice System.

(Potentially) traumatic events
Ruth Reed
‘Traumatic’ events rip up the rule book of life. The ultimate impact depends not only on qualities of an event itself, but on its
antecedents and consequences. Moreover, the meaning ascribed to the experience by the individual and the responses of friends,
family and societal structures, determine whether the path that follows is one of guilt and shame or acceptance and recovery.
Assumptions about others’ experiences are often mistaken, being filtered through the imperfect lens of one’s own internal world.
Placing ‘potentially’ before ‘traumatic’ gives credence to the capacity for human growth and resilience, rising from the ashes of
adversity.
