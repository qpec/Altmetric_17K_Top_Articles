AbsTrACT
Scientific and public interest relating to golf and health 
has increased recently. Players, potential players, the golf 
industry and facilities, and decision makers will benefit 
from a better understanding of how to realise potential 
health benefits and minimise health issues related to 
golf. We outline an International Consensus on Golf 
and Health. A systematic literature review informed 
the development of a survey. Utilising modified Delphi 
methods, an expert panel of 25 persons including public 
health and golf industry leaders, took part in serial 
surveys providing feedback on suggested items, and 
proposing new items. Predefined criteria for agreement 
determined whether each item was included within each 
survey round and in the final consensus. The working 
group identified 79 scientifically supportable statement 
items from literature review and discussions. Twenty-five 
experts (100%) completed all three rounds of surveys, 
rating each item, and suggesting modifications and/
or new items for inclusion in subsequent surveys. After 
three rounds, 83 items achieved consensus with each 
with >75% agreement and <10% disagreement. These 
items are included in the final International Consensus 
on Golf and Health. The final consensus presented here 
can inform scientific knowledge, and action plans for (1) 
golfers and potential golfers, (2) golf facilities and the 
golf industry, and (3) policy and decision makers external 
to golf. These outputs, if widely adopted, will contribute 
to an improved understanding of golf and health, and 
aid these groups in making evidence-informed decisions 
to improve health and well-being.
InTroduCTIon
Recent consensus statements related to sport and 
health have provided comprehensive, evidence-in-
formed summaries of key issues1–3 to help 
people make informed decisions, and to guide 
implementation.4
Golf is a sport played by over 60 
million people 
on six continents.5 6 There has been a recent increase 
in scientific and public interest relating to golf and 
health with a decade on decade increase in scien-
tific papers and their uptake.7 8 Our 2016 systemat-
ically conducted scoping review7 and others9 have 
highlighted that golf can provide moderate-in-
tensity physical activity, and may be associated 
with longevity,10 physical health11 12 and wellness 
benefits.13 14 Conversely, negative health outcomes 
including injury15 16 and an increased risk of skin 
cancer17 have been associated with playing golf.
The need for a comprehensive, evidence-in-
formed consensus summary of key issues, and 
key actions with regard to golf and health was 
recognised by the World Golf Foundation and its 
constituent members who are golf’s global leaders.
The objectives of this study are:
 
►
To engage leaders at the intersection of health, 
sport, policy and golf to build a cross-sectoral 
agreement relating to golf and health.
 
►
To achieve consensus on (1) the health risks and 
benefits associated with golf, (2) how individ-
uals and populations can improve their health 
through playing golf or spectating at events, (3) 
how the golf industry and (4) policymakers can 
increase opportunities for gaining health bene-
fits through golf and minimise the health risks 
of golf.
This consensus will enable players, potential 
players and spectators to benefit from knowledge 
of how to realise health benefits, and minimise 
associated health risks related to golf. It will facil-
itate policymakers to raise awareness and support 
potential public health interventions, and the golf 
industry to support education and best practice.
MeThods
The consensus was reached by use of the Delphi 
method. This is a well-accepted, rigorous and 
systematic method for achieving consensus of 
opinion among experts and identifying priorities 
on real-world issues.18 These methods can assist 
in drawing on the best available evidence, and the 
opinions and experiences of individuals and the 
organisations they represent. Methods developed 
by Dalkey and Helmer19 have been refined and 
adapted for a range of settings including healthcare, 
sport and policy.20–27 The Appraisal of Guidelines 
for Research and Evaluation 228 instrument was 
used to inform the conduct of this study.
Preliminary work: literature review and 
framework development
A working group of five individuals with expertise 
in public health, golf and health, policy, industry 
and research methods was established to facilitate 
the Delphi consensus process. Preliminary work 
was conducted by the working group who updated 
a 2016 systematic search (screening a further 669 
relevant records), and extracting further data as 
shown in figure 1.7 8 Relevant guidelines and policy 
documents were reviewed, and discussions with 
authors of primary studies and reviews, and other

leading authorities were conducted where clarification was 
helpful.
A framework for organising the available evidence for building 
a golf and health consensus was developed. Each domain/heading 
was populated with potential items for inclusion in the proposed 
survey. A draft survey was generated using Survey Monkey (San 
Mateo, USA), which was assessed for content and form by the 
working group and three additional researchers with expertise 
in public health.
selection of expert panel
To maximise objectivity in expert panel selection, it was deter-
mined to invite all 25 contributors to the 2018 International 
Conference on Golf and Health, a satellite meeting of the Inter-
national Society of Physical Activity for Health 2018 confer-
ence. These individuals had an expertise in one or more of (1) 
public health/physical 
activity for health policy, (2) the golf and 
health subject area, and (3) the golf industry. Potential expert 
panel members were sent an email introducing the concept, and 
providing a participant information leaflet. Consent was gained 
electronically.
rounds of delphi survey
Round 1
An initial questionnaire with proposed items for the consensus 
based on the preliminary work of the working group was circu-
lated to the expert panel. Each was invited to grade each item on 
a five-point Likert scale29 (‘strongly agree’, ‘agree’, ‘neither agree 
nor disagree’, ‘disagree’ and ‘strongly disagree’), and to suggest 
items and make comments that they thought would add value 
to the next iteration of the questionnaire. It was stated that the 
level of evidence for items was variable, and that expert panel 
input was encouraged. The survey results were collated by the 
working group.
Round 2
The anonymised results from round 1 were fed back to the panel 
allowing members to appreciate the opinions of others, and the 
reasons for their position.26
Cut-offs for levels of agreement at each round were defined 
‘a priori’ following working group discussion. In round 1, items 
scoring >65% 
agreement (agree or strongly agree) were included 
in the questionnaire for round 2. In keeping with established 
practice, modifications to existing items were incorporated by 
the working group following review of all expert panel comments 
from survey 1,18 while additional items suggested during round 
1 were discussed by the working group and where agreed added 
to the questionnaire. The 25 original experts were then invited 
to take part in a second round survey. Participants were invited 
to rescore each item on the Likert scale, and provide additional 
comments.
Subsequent rounds
Items scoring agreement of >75% in round 2 were included for 
round 3. Final consensus was defined as items scoring agree-
ment (agree or strongly agree) in 75%,25 27 and disagreement 
(disagree or strongly disagree) in <10% of respondents. The 
survey process was repeated until consensus had been reached 
(stability of existing items meeting criteria >85% of items)24 and 
no new items requiring inclusion.
data analysis
The results of each survey were exported from the Survey 
Monkey Platform to Excel (Microsoft, Washington, USA). 
Stacked leaning bar charts (Peltier Tech Advanced V
.3.0) were 
used to present data. A summary of methods is shown in figure 2.

literature review and framework development
The literature review identified 5605 records. After (1) screening 
of articles, (2) exclusion of duplicates, (3) further identification 
of studies through review of references (‘snowballing’) and (4) 
consultation with subject area experts, 342 articles had data 
extracted to inform the proposed International Consensus on 
Golf and Health.
Review of all data sources and working group discussions 
generated 79 statements/items emerging from the data which 
were categorised into three broad domains:

A summary of processes establishing the consensus are shown 
in figure 3.  All items reaching consensus are shown in table 3, 
with further detail provided in supplementary file 2.
summary of consensus
We aimed to establish a consensus on what is known based on the 
best available scientific evidence and identified 83 items covering 
three principle domains by Delphi process. The 25 expert panel 
members provided representation in global public health and 
sustainability, physical activity for health, health and sport policy, 
and included clinicians/academics with golf and health subject 
knowledge. Senior leaders/accountable officers from the World 
Golf Foundation, The R&A, the European Disabled Golf Foun-
dation, golf facility managers and professional organisations 
representing golf coaches internationally provided an industry 
context vital for the building of consensus, but importantly also 
for the ongoing engagement of stakeholders able to collaborate 
and deliver evidence-informed decisions and interventions to 
improve health and well-being in relation to golf.
Three principal domains were identified within the consensus 
with critical elements discussed below.
Domain 1: golf’s associations with health and mechanisms
This domain included 25 statements, with over 90% of the 
expert panel agreeing with each item. These statements describe 
health benefits/disbenefits of golf, the mechanisms by which 
benefits are achieved, and the volume and intensity of participa-
tion needed for these benefits.
Relationships of golf with health outcomes
The best available evidence reports golf can have overall health 
benefits,7 30 31 being associated with increased longevity10 32 and 
improving known risk factors for cardiovascular disease.11 12 33 34 
Golf is associated with mental well-being benefits,31 35–40 and can 
positively influence health for those with disability.31 41 Compared 
with other sports, the annual risk of injury is moderate,15 while 
golfers may be exposed to increased risk of skin cancer.7 17 The 
magnitude of health benefits will depend on many factors including 
age, gender, genetic factors, and the existing fitness/wellness of the 
participant, the topography of the course and the frequency of 
play.7 While a significant body of evidence exists relating to golf 
and health, further high-quality research is needed to assess relation-
ships between golf and mental health, benefits to particular popu-
lations, and to explore cause and effect relationships between golf 
and health.7 31 42
Mechanisms to achieve health outcomes
Golf can provide social interaction,38 42–45 health-enhancing physical 
activity,33 green exercise and nature connection for persons of all 
ages,31 42 45 46 and specifically can provide moderate-intensity aerobic 
physical activity.7 33 Strength and balance benefits are likely for older 
adults,47–49 while further research is needed to assess strength and 
balance benefits for wider populations.7 Health benefits are likely 
greater for those walking the course as opposed to riding a golf cart, 
although those playing and riding a cart do gain health benefits.7 33 
T
aking part in physical activities additional to golf is likely to offer 
further health gains.50 Spectating in an active fashion (eg, walking 
the course) at golf courses/tournaments offers an opportunity for 
health-enhancing physical activity.51 52
Dose and effect
Adults should meet WHO recommendations for physical 
activity.53 54 Participation in golf/other 
physical activities over and 
above the minimum guidelines is likely to offer additional bene-
fits.7 50 Being physically active/playing 
golf regularly throughout 
life provides greater benefits than being active/playing 
golf 
intermittently.
Domain 2: correlates, determinants, diversity and sustainability
This domain included 14 statements that describe who plays 
golf, what helps or hinders participation, and covers sustain-
ability considerations with respect to golf. Knowledge regarding 
patterns of participation and determinants is critically important 
in helping maximise interest and participation in a sport with 
well-accepted overall health benefits. Golf’s global leadership 
including The R&A, and the World Golf Foundation have iden-
tified challenges related to sustainability including improving 
diversity of participation, but opportunities to contribute posi-
tively and collaboratively towards the United Nations Sustain-
able Development Goals 2030.31 46 55 56
Behavioural patterns/participation
Over 60 
million people have played golf twice or more in the 
previous year.5 Participation is currently highest in North America, 
Australasia and Europe, and in in men compared with women, in 
middle-aged and older adults, in some ethnic groups (White-Euro-
pean heritage) and in those of middle and higher socioeconomic 
class.56–59 Over 20% of adults globally do not meet the WHO 
Global Recommendations on Physical Activity for Health.53 60

Consensus statement
Table 3 Final consensus statements and levels of agreement
domain 1: golf’s association with health and mechanisms
% Agreement
a. Relationship of golf with health outcomes
  
The best available evidence suggests playing golf regularly is associated with increased longevity.
100
  
Playing golf regularly can improve known risk factors for cardiovascular disease (eg, blood lipids and body composition).
100
  
As a physical activity, golf is likely to reduce the risk of chronic conditions including cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, colon and breast cancer, 
depression and dementia.
96
  
Playing golf is associated with mental well-being benefits which can include improved self-esteem, self-worth, self-efficacy and social connections.
100
  
Playing/involvement with golf can positively influence health for individuals with disability.
100
  
Playing golf can contribute to healthy and active ageing, providing physical and mental health, cognitive, social, functional and other benefits.
100
  
The annual incidence of injury playing golf is moderate compared with other sports, while the risk of injury per hour played is low compared with other sports.
96
  
Serious injury is rare, although accidental head injury sustained from being struck by a ball or club can have serious consequences.
96
  
While moderate sun exposure can offer benefits, golfers can be exposed to increased risk of skin cancer associated with excess sun exposure if appropriate 
care and consideration is not taken.
100
  
The magnitude of health benefits/health problems will depend on many factors including age, gender, genetic factors and the existing fitness/wellness of the 
participant, the topography of the course and frequency of play.
100
  
While a significant body of evidence exists relating to golf and health, further high-quality research is needed.
100
  
High-quality research is needed to assess relationships between golf and mental health/well-being, the contribution of golf to muscle strength and balance, 
benefits to particular populations, and to explore cause and effect nature of associations between golf and health.
100
b. Mechanisms to achieve health
  
Golf can provide health-enhancing physical activity for persons of all ages.
100
  
Playing golf can provide moderate-intensity aerobic physical activity.
100
  
The relative intensity of physical activity while playing golf can vary with topography and length of the course, environmental conditions, and the age, gender 
and baseline fitness of the participant.
100
  
Health benefits are likely greater for those walking the course as opposed to riding a golf cart (for those who are able).
100
  
Benefits accrued by those playing golf riding a golf cart may include health-enhancing physical activity, social connections and green exercise while the 
intensity of physical activity is lower compared with those playing and walking the course.
92
  
Playing golf is likely to provide strength and balance benefits for older adults.
100
  
Spectating in an active fashion (eg, walking the course) at golf courses/tournaments offers an opportunity for health-enhancing physical activity.
100
  
Playing golf outside can provide a form of green exercise and nature connection which can be enhanced in naturalistic courses.
100
  
Golf offers opportunities for intergenerational connection, for social interaction and to support communities with events of interest.
100
  
Taking part in physical activities additional to golf is likely to offer golfers further health benefits.
100
c. Dose and effect
  
Adults should do at least 150 min of moderate-intensity aerobic physical activity (which could include golf) throughout the week or do at least 75 min of 
vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity throughout the week, or an equivalent combination of moderate and vigorous-intensity activity to meet the WHO 
recommendations.
100
  
Participation in golf/other physical activities over and above the minimum physical activity guidelines is likely to offer additional benefits compared with those 
just reaching the minimum recommendations.
96
  
Being physically active/playing golf regularly throughout life provides greater benefits than being active/playing golf intermittently.
100
domain 2: correlates, determinants, diversity and sustainability
% Agreement
a. Behavioural patterns
  
Over 20% of adults globally do not meet the WHO Global Recommendations on Physical Activity for Health (WHO figures). Golf is popular in some regions 
where physical inactivity prevalence is high (North America, Europe, Australasia).
96
  
Of the over 60 million persons that have played golf at least twice in the previous year, participation is currently highest in North America, Australasia and 
Europe, in men compared with women, in middle-aged and older adults, in some ethnic groups (White-European heritage) and in those of middle and higher 
socioeconomic class (The R&A and Sports Marketing Suveys data).
96
b. Correlators and mediators
  
There is a need for an inclusive environment within golf that embraces, encourages and welcomes individuals, groups and families from all of society.
100
  
Some factors that help interest and participation in the sport are that golf can (1) be enjoyable, (2) be played throughout life, (3) offer a sense of community, 
(4) offer challenge and/or competition, (5) provide outdoor exercise and (6) provide time for self.
96
  
Golf can also teach life skills, while facilities can provide a social/community hub.
100
  
Golfers with disability can play equitably with able-bodied golfers or golfers with other types of disabilities at some courses/facilities.
88
  
Some factors that may hinder interest and participation in the sport include perceptions that it is expensive, less accessible for those from lower 
socioeconomic groups, male dominated, for older people or difficult to learn.
100
  
The cost of playing golf can hinder participation in some countries and at some facilities, while other facilities do offer affordable health-enhancing physical 
activity.
100
  
Physical proximity to a facility, transport options and playing restrictions can be barriers to participation.
96
  
Shorter forms of the sport, and efforts to avoid excessively slow play can offset the length of time and offer alternatives to those where time constraints are a 
barrier to participation.
100
  
Efforts to provide an infrastructure, social norms and regulations that are welcoming to all can lower barriers to participation.

Consensus statement
domain 2: correlates, determinants, diversity and sustainability
% Agreement
  
Not everyone will be attracted by the same things at a golf facility, so diversity and specialisation of golf facilities in keeping with the local context, culture 
and population is appropriate.
  
Aspects that can contribute to people stopping playing golf include: (1) it takes too much time from the family; (2) too expensive; (3) too long to play 18 
holes; (4) they tried but did not have fun; (5) too difficult and takes too long to learn; (6) health concerns; and (7) fear of being embarrassed.
88
96
c. Golf and sustainability
  
Golf can promote sustainability through practices that support diversity, healthy societies, environmental integrity and prosperity, and well-being at local and 
global scale.
100
domain 3: interventions and knowledge transfer
% Agreement
a. Interventions
  
Interventions to make the sport more inclusive and welcoming should be supported.
96
  
More interventions are required to increase access and participation, building on theories around engagement, enjoyment and including effective monitoring 
and evaluation aspects.
96
  
The health benefits of golf will be enhanced by appropriate partnership within and outwith the golf sector (eg, with health or education sector organisations). 100
b. Actions for golfers/participants
  
Golfers should aim to play golf at least 150 min/week, or engage in other forms of moderate to vigorous physical activities additional to golf.
100
  
Golfers should be encouraged to walk the course, as opposed to riding a golf cart to obtain optimal health benefits if able.
100
  
Golfers should be encouraged to make others feel welcome, and support others to enjoy golf.
100
  
Golfers should warm up with some aerobic exercise, then golf-specific mobility exercises, then practice swings to maximise performance and minimise injury 
risk.
100
  
Golfers should be encouraged to maintain hydration (drinking when thirsty and having fluids available) while on the course, particularly in hot and/or humid 
conditions.
100
  
Appropriate strength and conditioning exercises can decrease injury and illness risk, and improve performance.
100
  
Golfers should use sunscreen and appropriate clothing (collared shirt, hat, and so on) as appropriate, and moderate exposure to direct sunlight.
100
  
Education should be sought regarding playing safely. Children should be adequately supervised.
100
  
Spectators at golf tournaments can be encouraged to walk, and spectate in an active fashion.
100
  
Golfers should follow appropriate lightning safety guidelines, and discontinue play if there is danger from lightning.
96
  
Golf carts when driven should be done so responsibly, and following local guidance including minimum age requirements.
100
  
Golfers with cardiovascular disease can play with acceptable safety, but should see a doctor should symptoms increase or be unstable.
96
  
Golfers can be expected to return to golf following total knee, hip or shoulder replacement, with a graduated return to golf.
100
c. Actions for facilities/the golf industry
  
Golf facilities and the golf industry should communicate key actions including those generated in this consensus related to golf and health to players, and 
potential players in a consistent and engaging fashion, appropriate to their context.
100

Consensus statement
domain 3: interventions and knowledge transfer
% Agreement
  
The benefits of regular physical activity including playing golf should be communicated and promoted regularly for persons of all ages, genders and 
socioeconomic backgrounds.
100
  
Cross-sectoral policies should be delivered that support the WHO Global Action Plan on Physical Activity, and the United Nations Sustainable Development 
Goals.
92
  
Policymakers can be confident golf can provide health-enhancing physical activity to persons of all ages and genders. Policy documents, frameworks and 
actions should support this.
100
  
Policymakers should where relevant include golf as a moderate-intensity physical activity in policy documents, guidance and recommendation, and encourage 
participation for persons of all ages and genders.
100
  
Policy should support play by diverse geographical and socioeconomic participants of all genders, ages and abilities.
100
  
Policy documents, frameworks and actions can where relevant usefully acknowledge green space, health and well-being, nature connection, social and 
community, local and national economic benefits of golf.
96
  
Policymakers should support efforts to encourage spectators to be physically active (eg, walking the course) at golf and other sporting events.
100
  
Policies should promote multifunctionality (having facilities in addition to golf) and diversity of facilities where possible, and sustainable practices.
84
  
Policymakers should work collaboratively with the golf industry and national associations to promote increased participation in physical activity/golf, 
particularly in groups with low levels of physical activity.
96
  
Policymakers, governing bodies and the golf industry can work collaboratively to gain acceptance from the International Paralympic Committee that golf be 
included in the Paralympics.
92
% Agreement is the percentage of expert group members selecting ‘agree’ or ‘strongly agree’.
Table 3 Continued
Sports programmes that encourage participation across the lifespan 
have been recognised as an approach that can work to positively 
impact physical activity.61 62
Correlators and mediators
To increase participation in sport, there is a need for an inclu-
sive environment that embraces, encourages and welcomes 
individuals, groups and families from all of society,31 42 46 62 and 
this is true of golf.31 46 56 57 Efforts to provide an infrastructure, 
social norms and regulations that are welcoming to all can lower 
barriers to participation.31 46 63 Some factors that help interest 
and participation in the sport are that golf can (1) be enjoyable, 
(2) be played throughout life, (3) offer a sense of community, (4) 
offer challenge and/or 
competition, (5) provide outdoor exercise 
and (6) provide time for self.31 56 57 63 Golf can also teach life 
skills,45 while facilities can provide a social/community 
hub.31
Some factors that may hinder interest and participation in 
the sport include perceptions that it is expensive, less accessible 
for those from lower socioeconomic groups, male dominated, 
a sport for older people, or difficult to learn.31 56 63 The cost of 
playing golf can hinder participation in some countries and at 
some facilities, while other facilities do offer affordable opportu-
nities. Not everyone will be attracted by the same things at a golf 
facility, so diversity and specialisation of golf facilities in keeping 
with the local context, culture and population is appropriate.
Golf and sustainability
Promoting regular physical activity can support the attainment 
of a number of the United Nations Sustainable Development 
Goals.64 This consensus recognised the importance of supporting 
international policy31 54 55 64 and best practice in this regard. Golf 
can work to promote sustainability through practices that prior-
itise diversity, healthy societies, connection with and care of 
the environment, environmental integrity, and health and well-
being.31 42 45 46 57
Domain 3: interventions and knowledge transfer
The third domain contains 42 individual items, highlighting 
its fundamental importance. This section explores what inter-
ventions work in promoting golf, and what can practically and 
feasibly be done to maximise health benefits and minimise 
health risks associated with golf. The weight of evidence is 
generally weaker than for other categories, with some recom-
mendations based on consensus of opinion. Practical actions, 
building on existing progress, can help increase physical 
activity.61 62 65
Included are 13 actions for golfers/potential participants, 
18 actions for golf facilities/the 
golf industry and 10 actions 
for policy/decision makers external to the golf industry that if 
widely disseminated and adopted will contribute to an improved 
understanding of golf and health, and aid these groups in making 
evidence-informed, more consistent decisions and interventions 
to improve health and well-being. Representatives from these 
groups have been key in making these recommendations. These 
are summarised in the section below, and in table 3. Bite-sized 
assets (infographics, podcast and video; Murray AD, Info-
graphics and digital resources. An international consensus on 
gold and health. Under peer review) for golfers, the golf industry 
and facilities, and policy/decision makers have been produced to 
facilitate uptake by these groups.
Interventions
Appropriate partnerships within, and outwith the sport sector 
can support interventions to make the sport more inclusive and 
welcoming.31 42 45 46 57 Interventions are required to increase 
access and participation, building on theories around engage-
ment, enjoyment, and including effective monitoring and eval-
uation aspects.
Actions for golfers/participants
Golfers should aim to play golf at least 150 
min/week,7 53 or 
engage in other forms of moderate to vigorous physical activ-
ities additional to golf. Golfers can be encouraged to walk the 
course, as opposed to riding a golf cart if able.7 66 Warming 
up with some aerobic exercise (eg, stair climbing or stationary 
bike), then golf-specific mobility exercises, then practice swings 
can help maximise performance and minimise injury risk, as can 
appropriate strength and conditioning.67 68 Golfers should be 
encouraged to make others feel welcome, and support others to 
enjoy golf.31 42 Spectators at golf tournaments can be encouraged 
to walk, and spectate in an active fashion.

Murray AD, et al. Br J Sports Med 2018;52:1426–1436. doi:10.1136/bjsports-2018-099509
Consensus statement
To minimise health risks, golfers should follow appropriate 
lightning69 and golf cart safety guidelines.70 Golfers should use 
sunscreen and appropriate clothing (collared shirt, hat, and so 
on) as appropriate,71 and moderate exposure to direct sunlight.72 
Children should be adequately supervised.7 Golfers with cardio-
vascular disease can play with acceptable safety, but should see a 
doctor should symptoms increase or be unstable.7 Golfers can be 
expected to return to golf following total knee, hip or shoulder 
replacement, with a graduated return to golf.73
Actions for golf facilities/the golf industry
Recommendations are presented for golf facilities and the golf 
industry. The World Golf Foundation and The R&A who lead 
golf development activity globally are committed to working 
with a range of stakeholders to deliver and support key actions 
related to golf and health, and communicate key actions to the 
60 
million golfers worldwide.
Grass-roots initiatives supporting development of golf in 
regions/countries 
where golf is a relatively new sport can help 
encourage growth in these areas.6 45 56 Golf facilities and the 
golf industry should build on existing initiatives promoting 
inclusivity, and encourage increased participation by devel-
oping environments and price structures that are welcoming 
to all.31 42 45 57 The golf industry/golf facilities can encourage 
and facilitate regular physical activity, other health-enhancing 
behaviours (eg, healthy eating), and counsel about the dangers 
of excessive sun exposure. Practices that enhance sustainability, 
including maximising opportunities for wildlife conservation, 
interaction with green space, restricting water, energy and pesti-
cide/chemical use, should be encouraged.42 56
Golf facilities and other golf industry leaders and stakeholders 
can commit and can work together to develop an environment that 
will inspire and recruit more women and girls to play golf, and retain 
their participation in the game.46 56 Effective learning and coaching 
environments, and entry-level play, can be further encouraged, with 
facilities considering the preferences of the average golfer.63 Facili-
ties should make every effort to promote equality and diversity, and 
make golf accessible and environmentally sustainable.42 Facilities 
should consider being multifunctional (having facilities in addition 
to golf; eg, gym, walking routes or child care) and having diversity 
of golf facilities.42
Further, facilities should be encouraged to:
1. Provide information and facilities to support golfers warm-
ing up to play.
2. Stock sunscreen, hats and collared shirts, healthy food and 
water.71
3. Consider providing cardiopulmonary resuscitation training 
to staff, and provide automatic external defibrillators.7
4. Adequately maintain golf carts with speed limiters and front 
wheel brakes.
5. Provide appropriate lightning safety policies.
Actions for policy/decision makers (outwith the golf sector)
Decision makers at community/municipal, local, national and 
international levels have engaged in discussions which informed 
this consensus, and future delivery of plans. This consensus has 
considerable alignment with the WHO Global Action Plan on 
Physical Activity,54 and the United Nations Sustainable Develop-
ment Goals.55 Further cross-sectoral collaboration can further 
support these global efforts. Policymakers can work collaboratively 
with the golf industry and national associations/federations 
to 
promote increased participation in physical activity/golf, particu-
larly in groups with low levels of physical activity (eg, older adults).
The benefits of regular physical activity including playing golf 
should be communicated and promoted regularly for persons of 
all ages, genders and socioeconomic backgrounds. Golf can be 
included as a moderate-intensity7 33 physical activity in policy 
documents, guidance and recommendations, and participation 
encouraged for persons of all ages and genders. Policy docu-
ments, frameworks and actions can, where relevant, usefully 
acknowledge green space, health and well-being, nature connec-
tion, social and community, and local and national economic 
benefits of golf.31 These policies should support play by diverse 
geographical and socioeconomic participants, of all genders, 
ages and abilities, multifunctionality of facilities and sustain-
ability considerations.
strengths and limitations of present study
Strengths of the present study include the systematic nature of 
the literature review, and a 100% response rate from experts 
identified as leaders across public health/physical 
activity for 
health policy, the golf industry, and the golf and health subject 
area. Recommended standards for the conduct of Delphi studies 
were followed.27 This engagement in coproducing this consensus 
will aid collaboration in delivering the interventions and action 
plans that can maximise the impact of this work. We used objec-
tive criteria for expert panel selection. The level of agreement 
for inclusion within the consensus was high, and the threshold 
for excluding items low, important given the engagement with 
the golf industry and potential conflict of interest.
Although the search was conducted systematically, using 
established scoping review methodology,74 75 and some quality 
assessment was carried out, formal and systematic quality assess-
ment of each study was not conducted due to the large range of 
subjects to be covered. The items are based on the best available 
evidence, and that in many cases further and more definitive 
research is needed. Statements contain some element of repeti-
tion, which was considered necessary by the working group for 
the consensus, and action plans by relevant stakeholders to be 
comprehensive. As evidence and practice evolves, the consensus 
will require revisiting and updating.
ConClusIon
Our study has produced one of the first wide-ranging global 
consensus statements for a sport, and engaged leaders at 
the intersection of health, sport, policy and golf to build this 
cross-sectoral agreement. Consensus was achieved showing 
health benefits and health risks that golf is associated with, and 
highlighting actions by which (1) individuals and populations 
can improve their health through playing golf, and (2) how the 
golf industry/facilities and (3) policymakers can increase oppor-
tunities to gain health benefits through golf and minimise any 
health risks associated with golf. These outputs, if widely shared 
and adopted, will contribute to an improved understanding of 
golf and health, and aid these groups in making evidence-in-
formed decisions and to improve health and well-being. A 
stacked leaning bar graph showing level of  agreement  for each 
item for survey 3 is shown in figure 4.
