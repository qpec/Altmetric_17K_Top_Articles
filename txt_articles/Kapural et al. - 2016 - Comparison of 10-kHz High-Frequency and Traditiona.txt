 Comparison of 10-kHz High-Frequency and Traditional
Low-Frequency Spinal Cord Stimulation for the Treatment
of Chronic Back and Leg Pain: 24-Month Results From
a Multicenter, Randomized, Controlled Pivotal Trial
BACKGROUND: Pain relief with spinal cord stimulation (SCS) has focused historically
on paresthesias overlapping chronically painful areas. A higher level evidence supports
the use of SCS in treating leg pain than supports back pain, as it is difficult to achieve
adequate paresthesia coverage, and then pain relief, in the low back region. In com-
parison, 10-kHz high-frequency (HF10 therapy) SCS therapy does not rely on intra-
operative paresthesia mapping and remains paresthesia-free during therapy.
OBJECTIVE: To compare long-term results of HF10 therapy and traditional low-
frequency SCS.
METHODS: A pragmatic randomized, controlled, pivotal trial with 24-month follow-up was
conducted across 11 comprehensive pain treatment centers. Subjects had Visual Analog
Scale scores of $5.0/10.0 cm for both back and leg pain, and were assigned randomly (1:1) to
receive HF10 therapy or low-frequency SCS. The primary end point was a responder rate,
defined as $50% back pain reduction from baseline at 3 months with a secondary end point
at 12 months (previously reported). In this article, 24-month secondary results are presented.
Non-inferiority was first assessed, and if demonstrated the results were tested for superiority.
RESULTS: In the study, 198 subjects were randomized (101 HF10 therapy, 97 traditional
SCS). One hundred seventy-one subjects (90 HF10 therapy, 81 traditional SCS) successfully
completed a short-term trial and were implanted. Subjects averaged 54.9 6 12.9 years old,
13.6 6 11.3 years since diagnosis, 86.6% had back surgery, 88.3% were taking opioid
analgesics. At 3 months, 84.5% of implanted HF10 therapy subjects were responders for
back pain and 83.1% for leg pain, and 43.8% of traditional SCS subjects were responders for
back pain and 55.5% for leg pain (P , .001 for both back and leg pain comparisons, non-
inferiority and superiority). At 24 months, more subjects were responders to HF10 therapy
than traditional SCS (back pain: 76.5% vs 49.3%; 27.2% difference, 95% CI, 10.1%-41.8%; P ,
.001 for non-inferiority and superiority; leg pain: 72.9% vs 49.3%; 23.6% difference, 95% CI,
5.9%-38.6%; P , .001 for non-inferiority and P = .003 for superiority). Also at 24 months,
back pain decreased to a greater degree with HF10 therapy (66.9% 6 31.8%) than tradi-
tional SCS (41.1% 6 36.8%, P , .001 for non-inferiority and superiority). Leg pain also
decreased to a greater degree with HF10 therapy (65.1% 6 36.0%) than traditional SCS
(46.0% 6 40.4%, P , .001 for non-inferiority and P = .002 for superiority).
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates long-term superiority of HF10 therapy com-
pared with traditional SCS in treating both back and leg pain. The advantages of HF10
therapy are anticipated to impact the management of chronic pain patients substantially.

 of leg pain is well-studied, producing effective, durable paresthesias
in the back has been elusive. Thus for .4 decades, the primary
focus of innovation has been to improve the reliability of
paresthesia coverage.1,2 However, recent technological innova-
tion regarding the delivery of paresthesia-free SCS has shifted
focus from optimization of paresthesias to improved patient
outcomes, ie, pain relief. With European CE Mark since 2010
and US Food and Drug Administration approval in May 2015,
a paresthesia-free therapy provided via high-frequency stimula-
tion at 10-kHz (HF10 therapy) now is available to treat both
back and leg pain.3-6
With the objective of providing pragmatic clinical evidence,
a pivotal trial was designed to demonstrate safety, effectiveness,
and clinical benefit of paresthesia-free HF10 therapy compared
with traditional paresthesia-based low-frequency SCS for the
treatment of chronic intractable back and leg pain.7 In doing
so, this study was the first randomized, controlled, pivotal trial in
SCS history to compare device systems directly and to use back
pain as the primary end point.
Details of the study design, participants, interventions, and the
results through 12-months have been provided previously.3
Described briefly, HF10 therapy involves application of high-
frequency (10 kHz), short-duration (30 msec), low-amplitude (1-
5 mA) pulses to the T8-T11 spinal epidural space, which has
been shown to produce no paresthesia. Traditional SCS typically
involves application of low-frequency (40-60 Hz), longer
duration (300-600 msec), and higher amplitude (4-9 mA) pulses
to generate paresthesias as determined by an intraoperative
mapping procedure. At the 3-month primary end point, 84.5%
of implanted HF10 therapy subjects were responders ($50%
reduction in pain from baseline) for back pain and 83.1% for leg
pain. In comparison, 43.8% of traditional SCS subjects were
responders for back pain and 55.5% for leg pain (P , .001 for
non-inferiority and superiority for both back and leg pain
comparisons). The relative ratio for responders was 1.9 (95%
confidence interval 1.4-2.5) for back pain and 1.5 (95%
confidence interval 1.2-1.9) for leg pain. The superiority of
HF10 therapy compared with traditional SCS for leg and back
pain was sustained through 12 months (P , .001). None of the
HF10 therapy subjects experienced paresthesia.
Building on this evidence base, data collection from this study
continued to 24 months, providing comparative long-term
evidence important to healthcare providers. The aim of this study
was to demonstrate the comparative sustainability of the results,
which is particularly notable in that 24-month follow-up is
uncommon in chronic pain studies.
METHODS
Study Design
This prospective, randomized, controlled trial was designed to assess
primarily non-inferiority and secondarily superiority of HF10 therapy
compared with traditional low-frequency SCS in subjects with chronic
intractable back and leg pain. The study was conducted across 11
comprehensive pain treatment centers in the United States in compliance
with the US Code of Federal Regulations and recommendations guiding
physicians in biomedical research by the 18th World Medical Assembly,
Helsinki, Finland. The study protocol and informed consent forms were
approved by the Institutional Review Board of each study site (Western
Institutional Review Board, Puyallup, WA; Forsyth Medical Center IRB,
Winston-Salem, NC). The study was designed initially to assess safety and
effectiveness during a 12-month follow-up period. Data collection
subsequently was extended for an additional year.
Participants
Consenting patients under the care of the study investigators were
assessed for eligibility based on inclusion and exclusion criteria. Key
inclusion criteria were (1) chronic intractable pain of the trunk and/or
limbs, refractory to conservative therapy for a minimum of 3 months
(previous conservative treatments included pain medications, physical
therapy, spinal injections, pharmacological, and behavioral treatment); (2)
average back pain intensity of $5.0 out of 10.0 cm on the Visual Analog
Scale (VAS); (3) average leg pain intensity of $5.0 out of 10.0 cm on the
VAS; (4) an Oswestry Disability Index version 2.1a (ODI) score of 41 to
80 out of 1008; and (5) an appropriate candidate for the surgical
procedures required in this study. Prior surgical intervention for low back
pain was not a study eligibility requirement. Key exclusion criteria were
(1) an active disruptive psychological or psychiatric disorder or other
known condition significant enough to impact perception of pain, ability
to comply with the intervention, or evaluation of treatment outcomes;
(2) mechanical spine instability based on flexion/extension films of the
lumbar spine; or (3) prior experience with SCS. Near the 12-month
follow-up visit, included subjects were asked to re-consent to extended
data collection up to 24 months.
Randomization and Masking
Subjects were randomized 1:1 to receive stimulation with either an HF10
therapy system (Senza system; Nevro Corp., Redwood City, California) or
a commercially available SCS system (Precision Plus system; Boston
Scientific, Natick, Massachusetts). Both SCS systems consisted of two 8-
contact leads and a rechargeable implantable pulse generator (IPG).
Randomization was stratified by sex and primary area of pain (either back
or leg), and administered centrally with each study site assigned randomly
chosen alternating blocks of sizes 2, 4, and 6 with frequencies 0.25, 0.50, and
0.25, respectively, as generated by an independent statistician. Consecutive
subjects within each site-specific strata block then were assigned sequentially
to a treatment group, thus preserving the blinding of the study sites to
upcoming treatment group allocations. Study sites were notified by e-mail of
each random assignment only after the completion of all baseline assess-
ments. Due to practical considerations (see Discussion section), study
subjects and investigators were not masked to the assigned treatment group.
Procedures
Consistent with standard clinical practice, subjects underwent a screen-
ing trial of SCS lasting up to 14 days with an external stimulator to
determine short-term response. During the trial period, pain was assessed
per standard clinical practice. End of trial back and leg pain scores were
documented using VAS scales. For traditional SCS subjects, stimulation
parameters (pulse frequency, amplitude, and duration; active stimulation
contacts) were adjusted optimally to overlap paresthesia with the regions
of back and leg pain in the subjects. Paresthesia testing and associated
device programming were performed intraoperatively for traditional SCS

 subjects, then as needed based on subject feedback at standard clinic visits.
Subjects with HF10 therapy received 10 000 Hz, 30 msec stimulation
with amplitude and stimulation location adjusted to obtain optimal
analgesic response. Because HF10 therapy is paresthesia-free, intra-
operative programming was not performed for these subjects. Pro-
gramming occurred postoperatively and as needed based on subject
feedback at standard clinic visits. Programming for each treatment group
was provided with the assistance of the respective manufacturer under
the guidance of the investigators.
Oral analgesics were stabilized from 28 days prior to enrollment until
activation of the implanted SCS system, allowing for perioperative
analgesics. Adjustments were allowed subsequently under the guidance
of a study investigator as medically necessary, but the study protocol
instructed not to exceed baseline levels.
The same type of lead was used for both SCS systems. Two percutaneous
leads were placed in the posterior spinal epidural space under radiographic
imaging and attachedtoeitheranexternalstimulator (during the short-term
screening trial) or a subcutaneously implanted IPG. For HF10 therapy, the
distal tip of one lead was placed at T8 while a second lead tip was placed at
T9, both near anatomical midline. Lead placement for HF10 therapy did
not entail confirmation that they were positioned at physiological midline.
Lead position for HF10 therapy was based on extensive empirical
observation that most patients respond to stimulation application near
T9/10, while allowing for patient variation by covering T8-T11.4-6 For
traditional low-frequency SCS, leads were placed at vertebral levels based
on intraoperative paresthesia mapping involving patient feedback, typically
resulting in parallel lead tip placement at T7-T8.
A subcutaneous pocket was created using standard surgical technique
for placement of the IPG. The leads, anchored conventionally with
a manufacturer-supplied anchor, were tunneled to the pocket site and
connected to the IPG. Intraoperative impedance testing ensured electrical
integrity.

 Outcomes
The primary outcome of the study was a composite of safety and
efficacy: the percentage of subjects who responded to SCS therapy for back
pain ($50% reduction in VAS score) without a stimulation-related
neurological deficit. Secondary outcomes included the percentage of
subjects who responded for leg pain, the percent pain relief for back and
leg pain, and the disability level over the follow-up period.
Standardized outcome measures were assessed at predefined study visits
(baseline; 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months), including VAS for back and leg
pain, ODI, patient and clinician global impression of change, and subject
satisfaction. The primary end point was at 3 months, with a secondary end
point at 12 months (previously published).3 In this article, 24-month
secondary results are presented. In addition to adverse event reporting,
a standardized neurological assessment (including motor, sensory, and
reflex functions) was performed at each of the scheduled visits. Self-
reported outcomes were recorded by subjects on case report forms while
isolated from research staff and company representatives.
Statistical Analysis
Primary end point analyses were performed on intention-to-treat (ITT,
subjects receiving a randomization assignment), per protocol (PP, subjects
completing a primary end point assessment), and permanent implant (PI,
subjects passing a short-term screening trial and receiving a permanent
SCS system) populations. For subjects who had a successful screening trial
and received an IPG implant, the primary efficacy assessment occurred at
3 months post device activation. Subjects who did not have a successful
trial phase were considered non-responders for the ITT and PP analyses,
and excluded from the PI analysis. As this report focuses on the secondary
results at 24 months, the PI analyses are reported.
Sample size for efficacy was based on a non-inferiority comparison of
the primary end point between treatment groups. Using an exact binomial
test for non-inferiority of HF10 therapy to traditional SCS with a 10%
non-inferiority margin, 80% statistical power, 0.05 1-sided significance
level, and an estimated success rate of 58% for the test group and 48% for
the control group,9 a minimum of 77 randomized subjects per treatment
group were required. If non-inferiority was statistically demonstrated,
then the results were tested for superiority with 2-sided significance.
Non-inferiority is established if the lower bound of the 95% confidence
interval of the difference between the primary outcomes of treatment
groups(HF10therapy—traditional SCS) is greater than 210%. If HF10
therapy is worse (inferior) than traditional SCS by 10%, then there
would be ,2.5% probability of observing non-inferiority by chance
alone. If non-inferiority is established, then superiority may be
established if the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval of the
difference between the primary outcomes of treatment groups is greater
than zero. If HF10 therapy is equal to traditional SCS, then there would
be .2.5% probability of observing superiority by chance alone.
In addition to classifying subjects as responders ($50% decrease in
pain from baseline) or non-responders, subjects were post-hoc classified
as remitters or non-remitters. By expert consensus prior to the availability
of results, we defined a pain remitter as having a VAS pain score of #2.5
(irrespective of what treatments or medications are utilized).3
Secondary end points were evaluated successively for tests of non-
inferiority (hierarchical closed test approach) with 10% non-inferiority
margins and 1-sided .05 significance levels until statistical significance was

RESULTS
From June 7, 2012 to December 28, 2012, 241 patients were
enrolled and assessed for eligibility with 198 subjects proceeding
through baseline evaluations and randomized to a treatment group
(101 HF10 therapy, 97 traditional SCS; Figure 1). Of these, 171
subjects had a successful short-term screening trial and were
implanted with an SCS system (90 HF10 therapy, 81 traditional
SCS). Data were obtained on a high percentage of subjects
through 24 months (85 [94.4%] implanted HF10 therapy
subjects, 71 [87.7%] implanted traditional subjects, P = .12).
Randomized subjects averaged 54.9 6 12.9 years of age,
13.6 6 11.3 years since diagnosis, and 88.3% were taking opioid
analgesics with an average morphine-equivalent dose of 118.9 6
119.3 mg/d (Table 1). At baseline, 86.6% of subjects had
previous back surgery, with 77.1% diagnosed by a study
investigator as having “failed back surgery syndrome.” Other
frequent pain diagnoses were radiculopathy in 63.7% of subjects
and degenerative disk disease in 62.2% of subjects. Mean baseline
back pain VAS was 7.6 6 1.2 cm, while mean baseline leg pain
was 7.3 6 1.4 cm. Back pain was the predominant symptom in
54.6% of subjects.
For the primary outcome measure, more subjects were
responders to HF10 therapy than traditional SCS at 24 months
for both back pain (76.5% vs 49.3%; 27.2% difference, 95% CI,
10.1%-41.8%; P , .001 for non-inferiority and superiority) and
leg pain (72.9% vs 49.3%; 23.6% difference, 95% CI, 5.9%-
38.6%; P , .001 for non-inferiority and P = .003 for superiority;
Figure 2). As non-inferiority was established, superiority analyses
were justified.
HF10 therapy showed a similar advantage in terms of remission
rates at 24 months (back pain: 65.9% vs 31.0%; 34.9% difference,
95%CI,18.0%-49.0%,P , .001 for non-inferiority and P = .003
for superiority. Leg pain: 65.9% vs 39.4%; 26.5% difference, 95%
CI, 8.0%-41.2%; P , .001 for non-inferiority and P = .001 for
superiority). For subjects who achieved remission (including both
HF10 therapy and traditional SCS subjects), back pain averaged
1.1 6 0.7 cm and leg pain averaged 0.9 6 0.7 cm.
At 24 months, back pain decreased to a greater degree for HF10
therapy subjects (point decrease: 5.0 6 2.5 cm; percent decrease:
66.9% 6 31.8%) than traditional SCS subjects (3.2 6 3.0 cm,
P , .001 for non-inferiority and superiority; 41.1% 6 36.8%,
P , .001 for non-inferiority and superiority; Table 2, Figure 3).
Similarly, leg pain decreased to a greater degree for HF10 therapy
subjects (4.7 6 2.8 cm; or pain scores decrease by 65.1% 6
36.0%) than traditional SCS subjects (3.7 6 3.0 cm, P , .001
for non-inferiority and P = .03 for superiority; 46.0% 6 40.4%,
P , .001 for non-inferiority and P = .002 for superiority).
Individual subject responses at 24 months for back and leg pain
are shown by treatment group in Figure 4. These charts present
the percent decrease in back and leg pain for each study subject,
indicating whether each subject was a responder or not.
Also at 24 months, HF10 therapy subjects had a favorable
distribution of ODI categorizations compared with traditional
SCS subjects (P = .02, Table 3), with 23.5% of subjects receiving
HF10 therapy having minimal disability compared with 9.9% of

 subjects receiving traditional SCS. Patient and clinician global
impression of change and subject satisfaction distributions also
reflect the benefits of HF10 therapy compared with traditional
SCS. Particularly notable, 60.0% of subjects were very satisfied
with HF10 therapy compared with 40.4% of subjects with
traditional SCS.
There were few study-related serious adverse events in each
treatmentgroupat24months,withsimilarratesofoccurrence(5.0%
for HF10 therapy, 7.2% for traditional SCS, P = .56, Table 4).
Importantly, there were no stimulation-related serious adverse
events or neurological deficits in either treatment group. Regarding
adverse events that did not reach the level of serious, the most
common were implant site pain (in 12.9% of HF10 therapy
subjects and 13.4% of traditional SCS subjects, P = .91) and
uncomfortable paresthesias (in 0.0% of HF10 therapy subjects and
11.3% of traditional SCS subjects, P , .001). Lead migration
resulting in surgical revision occurred in 3.0% of HF10 therapy
subjects and 5.2% of traditional SCS subjects (P = .49).
DISCUSSION
Thisstudydemonstrates notonlythenon-inferiority,butalsothe
long-term superiority of HF10 therapy compared with traditional
low-frequency SCS in treating both back and leg pain at 24 months.
Extending comparative safety and efficacy outcomes from 12 to 24
months provides physicians, patients, and payers with rigorous
evidence demonstrating the durability of SCS in treating chronic
pain. These results are particularly impressive given the degree of
pain chronicity and refractoriness of the study subjects.
Randomized controlled trials with substantial follow-up in the
SCS field are few. Two previous landmark studies in SCS evaluated
subjects with predominant leg pain. In a 2005 study, traditional
low-frequency paresthesia-based SCS was compared with reoper-
ation, wherein SCS was found to be more effective in treating
persistent radicular pain after lumbosacral spine surgery and often
obviated the need for reoperation.11 In a 2008 study, traditional
SCS was compared with conventional medical management,
wherein more subjects randomized to SCS had significant

 reduction in leg pain.12 The results of our study confirm the
durability of SCS in treating leg pain and also demonstrate long-
term effectiveness in treating back pain.
The minimal clinically important difference (MCID) in
reducing chronic pain has been shown to be 2 numeric rating
scale points (out of a scale maximum of 10 points) or 30%.13
Putting our study results into context, subjects treated with
traditional SCS achieved a 3.2 point average decrease in back pain
(which is 1.6 times the 2 point MCID) and a 41.4% average
decrease in back pain (which is 1.4 times the 30% MCID),

 a result noteworthy in and of itself. However, subjects treated
with HF10 therapy achieved a 5.0 point average decrease in back
pain (which is 2.5 times the 2 point MCID) and a 66.9% average
decrease in back pain (which is 2.2 times the 30% MCID).
Similar ratios were observed for leg pain reduction (traditional
SCS: 1.9 and 1.5, respectively; HF10 therapy: 2.2 and 2.2,
respectively). Thus, both therapies achieved pain reductions that
were beyond the MCID, yet HF10 therapy achieved more than
twice the MCID for both back and leg pain reduction.
Lack of paresthesias also might be a factor influencing long-term
pain control and improvement in function in subjects who
received HF10 therapy. Previous studies have suggested that the
presence of mildly to intensely uncomfortable paresthesias,
including uncomfortable stimulation surges due to patient move-
ments or repetitive daily activities, influence the compliance with
the use of traditional SCS.1,3 Because HF10 therapy is
paresthesia-free, such issues completely are absent and therefore
do not impact patients’ compliance with therapy use.
Summary statistics are important when comparing the results of
2 treatment groups in clinical trials, and are indeed the proper way
to convey results in the context of evidence based medicine.
However in clinical practice, individual patient results matter.
Figure 4 provides the results of each subject implanted with an
SCS system in our clinical trial. Doing so allows physicians and
their patients to understand more directly the potential outcomes
of the selected therapy when treating chronic back and leg pain.

 active treatments), degree of oversight (US Food and Drug
Administration, independent data, and safety monitoring board),
and duration of follow-up (24 months) with high subject retention
(94.4% of HF10 therapy subjects and 87.7% of traditional SCS
subjects).
Limitations
As with any clinical trial, there are limitations. Study inves-
tigators and subjects were not masked to the assigned treatment
group. Subject masking was impractical because low-frequency
SCS produces paresthesias, whereas high-frequency SCS does not;
thus, the therapies themselves become immediately known to the
subjects. Due to the differences in stimulator lead placement,
intraoperative testing, and device programming between the
treatment groups, the study investigators could not be masked.
The effect of the lack of masking in this randomized study is not
known; nonetheless, the protocol was based on best practices
guidance for comparative efficacy trial designs.14-16
Although the study protocol defined specific inclusion and
exclusion criteria, heterogeneity in pain diagnoses was observed,
with many subjects having multiple diagnoses (Table 1). This
etiological heterogeneity reflects the diversity of patients seen
when managing chronic back and leg pain, and is therefore
a clinically relevant population to evaluate, especially given the
pragmatic nature of this study.
Future Directions
Future research regarding HF10 therapy is expected to focus on
other chronic pain indications such as arm and neck pain, relative
cost-effectiveness,17 as well as a better understanding of the
mechanism of action. Clinical application of SCS initially was
inspired by the Gate Control Theory of pain, which suggested
that increased activity of large innocuous afferents presynaptically
inhibit input to pain-transmitting projection neurons via
inhibitory interneurons, as well as trigger supraspinal circuits
that also modify spinal pain processing.18,19 That core concept
remains, but the detailed mechanisms of action of traditional SCS
(ie, paresthesia-based) still are not understood completely.20 In
recent years, preclinical work investigating traditional SCS have
suggested new neural interactions (eg, postsynaptic modulation),
as well as key neurotransmitters and neuropeptides that may be
involved in pain relief from stimulation.21-25 Indeed, attempts to
model and understand these circuits beyond the original Gate
Control Theory still are emerging.26,27 Given the gross clinical
similarity of application, HF10 therapy also may work with these
same neural structures, yet may modulate them in a different
manner (eg, desynchronization) in such a way that yields a more
robust clinical outcome.28 Additional research is needed to detail
the direct spinal effects of HF10 therapy.
CONCLUSION
The advantages of HF10 therapy are anticipated to impact the
management of patients with chronic back and leg pain sub-
stantially, and possibly other pain conditions. The superior and
durable results demonstrated in this study are anticipated to lead to
improved long-term cost effectiveness and payer acceptance,
making this therapy broadly available to patients suffering from
chronic pain.

COMMENTS
S
pinal cord stimulation (SCS) has been used as a modality to treat
chronic pain since 1967 when Dr Shealy implanted the first spinal
cord stimulator in a terminally ill patient with bronchogenic carcinoma
and right lower chest pain.1 Since then there have been advances in lead
and battery design, understanding bioelectrical mechanisms, and stim-
ulation methodology. This multicenter, randomized, controlled trial
compares the efficacy of high-frequency SCS with traditional SCS for the
treatment of intractable leg and back pain. The authors found that both
back and leg pain decreased to a greater degree for 10-kHz high-
frequency (HF10) therapy patients (66.9% and 65.1%, respectively) at 2
years. Additionally, the streamlined implantation and programming of
HF10 systems offers significant benefit to the clinician and is exciting
from a workflow perspective. A major limitation to this study is the lack
of blinding. Although the improvement in visual analog scale was sta-
tistically significant, patients knew which stimulator (newer vs older
technology) they received, inherently biasing their perceptions. Fur-
thermore, the traditional stimulation that was used was not the latest
generation of SCS offered. That said, the current study makes a mean-
ingful contribution to the pain literature by demonstrating how far SCS
technology has come since the PROCESS trial when 48% of patients
achieved .50% leg pain, but not back pain relief, at similar follow-up.2
The efficacy of SCS for predominant back pain with latest-generation
technology changes our patient selection criteria and expands the pool of
patients that may benefit from neuromodulation. Most interesting,
scientifically, is that HF10 dispels previous beliefs on SCS mechanism of
action, namely that paresthesias are needed. Now that we know this is
not the case, we must reframe our understanding of how SCS works. The
next step clinically to improve our understanding of HF10 and other
new technologies is to determine which patients benefit from which
parameters both through subjective and objective outcomes.3

he authors present 24-month data from an industry-sponsored ran-
domized trial, comparing traditional, low-frequency, paresthesia-
producing spinal cord stimulation (SCS) to a new non-paresthesia-
generating SCS system delivering 10-kHz high-frequency (HF10) stim-
ulation. At 24-month follow-up, more subjects were responsive to HF10
therapy than standard SCS and had a greater degree of pain relief both for
back and leg pain. Although traditional SCS has a long track record and
a number of well-designed randomized trials to its name, for a variety of
reasons it remains stigmatized by many in the medical community. Thus,
this study demonstrating superior outcomes to traditional SCS is a wel-
come addition to the field.
A number of concerns:
1. The authors introduce the term “remitters,” defined as those with
a VAS score of ,2.5 after treatment. I would recommend using this
term in a prudent and cautious fashion. As the authors note, this does
not take into account any changes in pharmacologic therapy.
Moreover, the field of chronic pain is littered with the carcasses of
interventions initially thought to be near-panaceas that were later
found to be, at the very best, effective for a select group of patients,
and, at worst, marginally effective or ineffective in the long-term. As
traditional SCS has a much longer track record than HF10 therapy,
and as the mechanism of action of HF10 therapy is unknown, the
longevity of efficacy of this therapy remains unclear.
2. The authors mention that the paresthesias produced by “tradi-
tional” SCS can influence compliance with therapy usage. I have
rarely found this to be a significant problem—indeed, for some
patient groups (ie, the elderly), absence of paresthesias may be
deleterious to ensuring compliance. I would suggest that more
emphasis be placed on the superior outcomes of this therapy vs
traditional SCS as opposed to the perceived benefits of paresthesia-
free stimulation.
3. Traditionally, when SCS has been effective in the treatment of back
pain, it has been for the constant, “neuropathic” component of the
pain as opposed to a more mechanical-type, nociceptive pain,
frequently experienced even in the absence of instability. Although
the authors specifically excluded patients with instability on dynamic
spine x-rays, I would warn against using SCS of any type to treat
primary axial back as opposed to radicular pain, or mixed pain with
a predominant radicular component.
4. A concern particularly relevant to the neurosurgical community is the
lack of availability of a surgical, ie, paddle-type lead. The majority of
SCS systems placed by neurosurgeons (as opposed to non-surgical
specialists such as anesthesiologists) are paddle leads, as most neuro-
surgeons are not trained in or comfortable with percutaneous lead
placement. Furthermore, in a subset of patients where percutaneous
access cannot be obtained (ie, extensive spinal fusions), a paddle
electrode is the only option. Given these initial promising results, I
would imagine that such a lead will be available in the near future.
It is likely that the future of SCS therapy will not be a “one-size-fits-
all” approach—traditional tonic paresthesia-producing stimulation,
high-frequency stimulation, “burst” stimulation, and newer targets
such as the dorsal root ganglion may, individually or in combination,
benefit different subclasses of patient, and even the same patient at
different times. At the present time, we have no data to guide our
choice of therapy in a particular patient, and I am pessimistic that high-
quality data will be available in the near future. Thus, devices that have
the ability to provide all of these therapies likely will capture the
majority of the market share.
