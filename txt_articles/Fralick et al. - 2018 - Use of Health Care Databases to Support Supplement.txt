Indications of Approved Medications

IMPORTANCE Manufacturers of US Food and Drug Administration–approved prescription
drugs often apply for additional indications based on randomized clinical trials. Real-world
database analyses on a medication’s use and outcomes in routine settings of care might help
to inform decision making regarding such supplemental indications.
OBJECTIVE To examine whether longitudinal data from a health care database can support
the results of a randomized clinical trial that led to a supplemental indication for telmisartan.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This cohort study of patients newly prescribed
telmisartan or ramipril used insurance claims data from a nationwide health care database
from January 1, 2003, through September 30, 2009, to compare patient outcomes. This
study replicated the inclusion and exclusion criteria used in the Ongoing Telmisartan Alone
and in Combination with Ramipril Global End-point Trial (ONTARGET) and used propensity
score matching to balance 74 patient characteristics. Data analysis was performed from
February 15, 2017, to May 24, 2017.
EXPOSURES Telmisartan use vs ramipril use.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was a composite of myocardial
infarction, stroke, or hospitalization for congestive heart failure.
RESULTS Of the 640 951 patients included in the study, 48 053 were newly prescribed
ramipril (mean [SD] age, 68.29 [9.52] years; 31 940 male [66.5%]) and 4665 were newly
prescribed telmisartan (mean [SD] age, 69.43 [9.60] years; 2413 male [51.7%]). After
propensity score matching, a total of 4665 patients were newly prescribed telmisartan (mean
[SD] age, 69.43 [9.60] years; 2413 [51.7%]), and 4665 patients were newly prescribed
ramipril (mean [SD] age, 69.36 [9.67] years; 2343 male [50.2%]). As seen in ONTARGET, the
composite risk of stroke, myocardial infarction, and hospitalization for congestive heart
failure was similar for the 2 medications (hazard ratio, 1.0; 95% CI, 0.9-1.1). In addition, the
study found that telmisartan was associated with a substantially decreased risk of
angioedema (hazard ratio, 0.1; 95% CI, 0.03-0.56) compared with ramipril.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Real-world data analyses of patients receiving routine care
provided findings similar to those found in the randomized clinical trial that established
telmisartan’s supplemental indication. In certain situations, database studies may support
supplemental applications for effectiveness for already approved medications.

nDecember2016,the21stCenturyCuresActwassignedinto
law in the United States.1 It contained a provision
intended to promote real-world data studies of medica-
tion use and outcomes in routine clinical settings in US Food
and Drug Administration (FDA) authorization of additional
indications for already approved prescription drugs.1 Such
data, with or without randomization, are drawn from health
care use data, insurance claims, registry studies, and/or elec-
tronic health record systems in typical clinical settings of
care.2-4 Although the FDA has long used such data to clarify
the safety of medications, the data can seldom establish a
drug’
s effectiveness. Well-designed randomized clinical trials
are the criterion standard for assessing whether a drug is effi-
cacious because random treatment assignment and a con-
trolled research environment can more readily support
causal inferences.
In recent years, new methodologic approaches have im-
provedthevalidityandreproducibilityofnonrandomizeddata,
including new-user designs,5 active comparators, propensity
score (PS) matching, and controlling for disease risk scores.6,7
Other important aspects include assessing covariates before
cohortentry(toavoidadjustingforintermediatevariables)and
defining cohort entry as the time when the patient first re-
ceives the exposure of interest (to decrease the possibility of
immortal time bias).6-8
Can such analytic techniques confirm supplemental indi-
cations for already approved drugs? Approximately half of all
drugs approved in the United States are later approved for
supplemental indications, modifications to the initial indica-
tion, or expanded populations.9,10 Supplemental indications
aretypicallyidentifiedonthebasisofprospectiveclinicaltrials.
To determine whether real-world data analyses can confirm a
supplemental indication, we identified a supplemental ap-
proval amenable to study and applied the same inclusion and
exclusion criteria and outcomes measurements that were used
in the pivotal randomized clinical trial.
Methods
Our cohort study was conducted in commercially insured
patients using the MarketScan health care database pro-
vided by Truven (January 1, 2003, through September 30,
2009). This nationwide database captures anonymized lon-
gitudinal, individual-level data on health care use, patient
demographics, inpatient and outpatient diagnostic and pro-
cedural codes, and pharmacy dispensing of prescription
drugs for more than 60 million commercially insured
people in the United States. The study was approved by the
institutional review board at Brigham and Women’
s Hospi-
tal, including a waiver for informed consent, and a valid
data licensing agreement was in place. All data were anony-
mized and deidentified.
Data Sources
To identify an experimental setting, we reviewed all supple-
mental applications to the FDA from 2005 to 2014 and their
accompanying clinical trials.9 The supplemental indications
were classified into 3 mutually exclusive categories: new in-
dication(n = 138),modification(n = 86),andexpansion(n = 66)
(eAppendix in the Supplement).9 Of the 138 new indications,
108 (78.3%) of the pivotal clinical trials had a primary out-
come that was not identifiable in US longitudinal health care
databases (eg, pathology results, change in clinical scores, and
radiologic tumor response), 12 (8.7%) did not have an active
comparator, 4 (2.9%) were based on in-hospital medication ad-
ministration (eg, postoperative nausea medication, anes-
thetic medications), and 14 (10.1%) were potentially repli-
cablewiththeclaimsdataavailabletous.Ofthe14,weselected
telmisartan a priori and did not analyze data for the other 13
(eAppendix in the Supplement).
The angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) telmisartan
(Micardis) was approved as an antihypertensive in 1998. In
October 2009, it was approved supplementarily for cardio-
vascular risk reduction in patients 55 years or older who
are unable to take angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors
(ACE-Is) and have a high risk of major cardiovascular events.
Telmisartan was an optimal case study for 3 reasons. First,
the primary outcome in the pivotal supplemental indication
trial could be accurately identified in health care use data.
Second, the randomized clinical trial used an active com-
parator, the ACE-I ramipril (Altace), which would minimize
confounding in cohort studies.3,7 Third, the inclusion crite-
ria, exclusion criteria, and baseline patient characteristics
were identifiable in claims data.
The trial that identified the supplemental indication for
telmisartan for cardiovascular risk reduction, Ongoing Telmis-
artan Alone and in Combination with Ramipril Global End-
point Trial (ONTARGET), was published in April 2008.11
ONTARGET’
s primary objectives were to determine whether
telmisartan was at least as effective as ramipril at reducing
cardiovascular risk and to assess whether the combination of
telmisartan and ramipril was more effective than ramipril
alone. The trial was conducted across 733 centers in 40 coun-
tries between 2001 and 2008.11
Study Cohort
Potentially eligible patients must have had at least 6 months
of continuous enrollment in a participating health plan be-
fore the date of cohort entry. Our inclusion and exclusion cri-
Key Points
Question Can health care databases be used to confirm a
supplemental indication that has been demonstrated in a
randomized clinical trial for an approved medication?
Findings This cohort study replicated the results of a randomized
clinical trial that established the supplemental indication for
telmisartan by using data from a US health care database
(insurance claims data) available at the time that the supplemental
indication was approved. Similar to the randomized clinical trial,
our study revealed a decreased risk of angioedema with
telmisartan compared with ramipril.
Meaning In certain clinical scenarios, database studies may
support supplemental effectiveness applications for already
approved medications.

 teria mirrored those of ONTARGET.11 We included patients 55
years or older who filled a new prescription for telmisartan or
ramipril (no fills for either drug or any other ACE-I or ARB dur-
ing the prior 180 days). Cohort entry date was the first day of
a prescription fill. As in ONTARGET, we included patients with
a diagnosis of coronary artery disease, peripheral artery dis-
ease, cerebrovascular disease, or diabetes mellitus during the
180 days before cohort entry.
As in ONTARGET, we excluded patients with a limited life
expectancy (ie, living in a hospice, palliative care facility, or a
nursing home and those with cancer), liver disease, syncope
or a recent myocardial infarction (within 2 days of cohort
entry), transient ischemic attack (within 7 days of cohort
entry), percutaneous transluminal coronary angiography
(within 30 days of cohort entry), or hospitalization for con-
gestive heart failure during the 180 days before cohort entry.
Other exclusion criteria used in ONTARGET were not applied
because they were not readily identifiable (known allergy to
study medication, unable to tolerate study medication,
hemodynamically significant primary valvular or outflow
tract obstruction, uncorrected volume or sodium depletion,
planned cardiac procedure, blood pressure >160/100 mm Hg
despite treatment, significant renal artery stenosis, and
angina in the absence of multivessel coronary artery disease)
or rare (hereditary fructose intolerance, complex congenital
heart disease, primary hyperaldosteronism, and heart trans-
plant). We also excluded patients who previously received
any ACE-I or ARB.
Study End Point
Our primary outcome was a composite of myocardial infarc-
tion, stroke, or hospitalization for congestive heart failure
using the primary discharge diagnosis code for an inpatient
visit (see eTable 1 in the Supplement for International Classi-
fication of Diseases, Ninth Revision codes). These definitions
have satisfactory measurement characteristics; the positive
predictive value for myocardial infarction was 93% or
higher; stroke, 81% or higher; and congestive heart failure,
87% or higher.12-14 Cardiovascular deaths were included in
the composite outcome if they occurred during a hospital-
ization for myocardial infarction, stroke, or heart failure but
not outside the hospital.
Statistical Analysis
Our primary analysis compared the rates of the composite end
point among patients initiating treatment with telmisartan vs
ramipril. Data were censored for patients when they dis-
continued use of their initial medication, switched to the
comparator medication, experienced a study outcome, disen-
rolled from their health plan, or died, or on September 30,
2009.15 To address confounding, we adjusted for 74 patient
characteristics, including demographics, comorbid condi-
tions, concurrent medications, and health care use mea-
sures, using PS methods (Table 1 and eTable 2 in the Supple-
ment). To balance patient characteristics, we used 1:1 PS
matching with a caliper of 0.05 and did not perform further
variable selection. We compared standardized differences to
evaluate the level of balance achieved in patient characteris-
tics after PS matching16 and used unstratified Cox propor-
tional hazards regression to compute hazard ratios (HRs) and
95% CIs. We then performed a predefined secondary analysis
that carried forward the exposure to the first-used medica-
tion for 365 days.6
To assess the robustness of our results, we also sought
to confirm the well-established increased risk of angio-
edema for ramipril, expecting that rates of angioedema
would be lower for telmisartan, as also demonstrated in
ONTARGET. To further assess robustness, we replicated all
study end points using a larger cohort derived from less
stringent exclusion criteria by creating a cohort that allowed
for past ACE-I or ARB use other than telmisartan or ramipril
in the preceding 180 days. All analyses were conducted
using the Aetion platform and R, version 3.1.2.5 (R Founda-
tion for Statistical Computing), which has been previously
validated for a range of studies17,18 and for predicting clini-
cal trial findings.19
Results
We identified 640 951 patients who filled a prescription for
ramipril or telmisartan from January 1, 2003, through Sep-
tember 30, 2009, and had a sufficient baseline enrollment pe-
riod of at least 180 days. After applying study inclusion and
exclusion criteria, 52 739 patients were included (Figure), of
whom 48 053 were newly prescribed ramipril (mean [SD] age,
68.29 [9.52] years; 31 940 male [66.5%]) and 4665 were newly
prescribedtelmisartan(mean[SD]age,69.43[9.60]years;2413
male [51.7%]) (a total of 21 patients did not begin follow-up).
Patients prescribed ramipril were more likely to be male and
have cardiac disease, whereas patients prescribed telmisar-
tan were more likely to have hypertension, kidney disease, and
previous transient ischemic attack or stroke and be pre-
scribed a calcium channel blocker (Table 1). After PS match-
ing 4665 telmisartan users (mean [SD] age, 69.43 [9.60] years;
2413 [51.7%]) to 4665 ramipril users (mean [SD] age, 69.36
[9.67] years; 2343 male [50.2%]), these differences were well
balanced with standardized differences less than 0.1 (Table 1).
Most frequencies of baseline characteristics were consistent
with ONTARGET (eg, similar age, rates of hypertension, coro-
nary artery disease, diabetes, and stroke), whereas some were
not(ie,lowerratesofangina,lowerratesofsmoking,lessdocu-
mented antiplatelet use, and more women included in our
study) (eTable 2 in the Supplement). In the unmatched co-
hort, mean follow-up time was 232 days (interquartile range,
113-454 days) for the ramipril group and 188 days (interquar-
tile range, 108-427 days) for the telmisartan group. The most
common reason for censoring was treatment discontinua-
tion, in 32 135 ramipril users (66.9%) and 3483 telmisartan
users (74.7%).
In ONTARGET, the relative risk of the composite out-
come of death from cardiovascular causes, myocardial infarc-
tion, stroke, or hospitalization for congestive heart failure was
1.01 (95% CI, 0.94-1.09), indicating no significant difference
between telmisartan and ramipril. In our study, the PS-
matched relative risk of the composite of myocardial infarc-

 tion, stroke, or hospitalization for congestive heart failure was
almost identical (HR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.85-1.14) (Table 2).
Sensitivity Analysis
A sensitivity analysis using the last exposure to the first-used
medication for 365 days without considering treatment dis-
continuation found that the primary end point occurred in 402
ramipril users (86 events per 1000 patients) and 363 telmis-
artan users (78 events per 1000 patients). This resulted in no
significant difference in risk after PS matching (HR, 0.90; 95%
CI, 0.77-1.04).
Validation Against a Known Causal Association
Among PS-matched individuals, there were 18 angioedema
events in new users of ramipril (3.1 events per 1000 person-
years) and 2 events in new users of telmisartan (0.4 events

 per 1000 person-years). A decreased risk (HR, 0.13; 95% CI,
0.03-0.56) of angioedema with telmisartan was also
observed in ONTARGET (HR, 0.40; P = .01).
Robustness of Findings
In the cohort with less stringent exclusion criteria to allow for
past ACE-I or ARB use apart from ramipril or telmisartan, we
identified8656PS-matchednewusersoftelmisartanand8656
PS-matched new users of ramipril. In this cohort, there was a
similar PS-matched relative risk of the composite of myocar-
dial infarction, stroke, or hospitalization for congestive heart
failure (HR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.88-1.08) (Table 3). A decreased PS-
matched risk of angioedema with telmisartan compared with
ramipril (HR, 0.35; 95% CI, 0.17-0.71) was also revealed.
Discussion
Among patients newly prescribed telmisartan and ramipril be-
fore the FDA’
s decision to approve a supplemental indication
for telmisartan, we found results that were almost identical to
those of the randomized clinical trial that led to telmisartan’
s
supplemental indication. We further identified and quanti-
fied the known causal association between ramipril and an-
gioedema.Thisfindingsuggeststhatourdataandanalysisplan
weresufficientlyvalidtodetectknowncausalassociationsfirst
identified in a prospective trial.20
This study is one of the largest to analyze real-world data
to mirror a large randomized clinical trial that had estab-
lished the clinical basis for a supplemental indication for a
medication. In contrast to ONTARGET, which took approxi-
mately 7 years to complete and cost tens of millions of dol-
lars, our study took approximately 12 weeks to implement for
less than a hundredth of the cost. The fact that our case study
bolstered the conclusions of a trial designed to identify a
supplemental indication for a marketed medication and was
done relatively efficiently using available data sets, rigorous
epidemiologic methods, and modern software platforms sup-
ports the concept of conducting similar database analyses as
part of routine practice for manufacturers submitting appli-
cations for supplemental indications to the FDA.21
Results concordant with the pivotal clinical trial can pro-
vide regulators with greater confidence in approving the in-
dication, whereas discordant results could warrant deeper re-
examination of the clinical trial or nonrandomized data. When
results are discordant with the pivotal trial, an in-depth analy-
sis of the trial and the nonrandomized study will be neces-
sary to identify reasons for this discordance. These reasons can
include issues related to study design, statistical analysis, and
patient population. Additional research will be necessary to
help navigate this scenario.22 Eventually, the FDA can de-
velop empirically based guidance on when database analyses
are useful in this context and when they are less reliable as a
confirmatory source.
Validity of Nonrandomized Real-world Data Analyses
There have been examples of real-world data providing results
beforetherandomizedclinicaltrialwascompleted23-25andnon-
randomized real-world studies that changed prescribing prac-
ticesforwhichtherewilllikelyneverberandomizedclinicaltrial
findings.26-29 A common signal of quality among these studies
and our current study was the use of a new-user, active-
comparator design. This approach compares 2 groups of pa-
tients who newly start taking a medication and avoids compar-
ing 2 groups with intrinsically discrepant risk profiles as would
be found using a nonuser comparator or comparing new users
with ongoing users. The new-user design with an active com-
parator allows a more homogeneous baseline population and
was one of the main reasons why the observed baseline char-
acteristics for our patients were similar even before matching.
By design, approximately 80% of the 74 baseline characteris-
ticswerewellbalancedbeforePSmatching,suggestingthatun-
measuredfactorsmaybeequallybalanced.Similarresultswere
observed in the recent new-user, active-comparator study by
Graham et al26 that compared the safety and effectiveness of
rivaroxaban with those of dabigatran.
By contrast, some nonrandomized real-world studies30,31
found results that differed from those in subsequent random-
ized clinical trials.32-34 This difference can occur for many rea-
sons, including incorrect study design implementation, re-
verse causation,35 immortal time bias,8 depletion of
susceptibles,36 failure to identify important unmeasured con-
founding factors, or the inclusion of a different study popu-
lation than was used in the clinical trial. In particular, com-
parators that use patients defined as those who did not fill a
prescription(nonusers)mayintroducetreatmentselectionbias
that may not be controllable with any statistical method.37,38
Studies such as ours require that inclusion and exclusion
criteria and end points be adequately defined in a random-
ized clinical trial report and subsequently identifiable in the
health care data set being studied. Many trials include study

health care records (eg, rating scales used in trials of psychi-
atric medications) or not easily identifiable (eg, progression-
free survival used in oncology trials) without requiring chal-
lenging natural language processing of free-text information.
It would also be difficult to replicate results from randomized
clinical trials that include different treatment modalities with
substantiallydifferentrisk-benefitprofiles(eg,implantablecar-
dioverter defibrillators compared with medical therapy) be-
cause of fundamental differences in risk profiles between the

 analyses can also include subgroups of patients who are un-
derrepresented in clinical trials, including elderly individu-
als, patients with many comorbidities, pregnant women, and
other at-risk groups. In our study, for example, 50% of pa-
tients were women compared with approximately 26% in
ONTARGET. Finally, such studies can evaluate a larger popu-
lation of patients and can assess end points that trials are
often underpowered to detect, such as rare adverse events.
Limitations
Our observed null finding might reflect limitations within our
data set (eg, lack of out-of-hospital death data), duration of fol-
low-up,orstudydesignratherthanatrueobservation.Itiswell
established that noninferiority can appear to be present be-
cause of inadequate rigor or scale in any study, whether a ran-
domized clinical trial or an observational analysis.39,40 How-
ever, this does not explain the increased risk of angioedema
that we observed with ramipril but not telmisartan. Some
authors41,42havequestionedthevalueofPSmatchingovertra-
ditional risk-adjusted regression analysis, neither of which
guarantee full account for unmeasured confounding. How-
ever,ourunadjustedprimary,secondary,andsensitivityanaly-
ses did not change meaningfully after PS matching. Another
limitation of our study was an inability to assess medication
adherence beyond prescription filling, although this is gener-
ally seen as a valid measure of actual use.15
Conclusions
The FDA is currently considering how it will use nonrandom-
ized, real-world data as part of supplemental indication
applications.42,43 In the absence of large-scale empirical com-
parative analyses that identify the reasons for failure and suc-
cess to replicate randomized controlled findings with real-
world data analyses, we performed a case study that highlights
some important considerations. Many context-specific ques-
tions about study design, confounding control, data quality,
and outcome validity will need to be considered.4,6 Pre-
registering study designs and analysis plans and providing
a publicly available summary of the results when available,
similartothecurrentpracticeofrandomizedclinicaltrials,pro-
motes ethical conduct of these studies.
Even well-designed analyses sometimes result in incor-
rect conclusions, and some randomized clinical trials may be
inaccurate.44Retrospectivereviewsoftheliterature34,45-48pro-
vide single summarizations of the differences between these
2 approaches but provide few insights on the validity of indi-
vidualreal-worlddataanalyses.Toestablishameaningfulbase-
line, the FDA will need many sets of randomized clinical trials
with prospectively designed, nonrandomized analyses to
match the populations included in randomized clinical trials
across a range of clinical questions, each investigated with a
set of designs and methods following rigorous epidemiologic
principles.
Regulators have a difficult task in providing specific rules
for decision making in this maturing yet still developing and
highly context-specific field. However, if done selectively and
with principled methods, it might be feasible to use nonran-
domized, real-world data to provide supportive evidence in
establishing supplemental drug indications.

Global End-point Trial
(ONTARGET),2 which com-
pared the angiotensin receptor antagonist telmisartan and the
angiotensin-convertingenzymeinhibitorramiprilforthetreat-
ment of hypertension. That trial,2 published in 2008, found
that telmisartan was equally effective to ramipril, with fewer
incidences of angioedema. Participants who received both
drugs experienced more adverse events but no increase in
benefits.
ONTARGET was a good choice for this demonstration:
telmisartan, with a toxicity and adverse effect profile similar
to ramipril, was already approved for treating hypertension,
and many angiotensin receptor antagonists are noninferior to
angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors for preventing car-
diovascular events. The study by Fralick et al1 is valuable and
technically excellent; however, it examines only 1 drug-
indication pair of many. Thus, it is open to the criticism that
generalizing from 1 positive finding to a vast field of potential
treatment comparisons with observational data is analogous
to painting the target around the arrow, especially consider-
ing the high probability that the telmisartan-ramipril compari-
son would work.
Theory and experience have shown randomization to be
the key element of high-quality evidence when drawing causal
inferencesabouttherapeuticeffectsandwhenmakingthecase
for regulatory approval. The classic construct invokes a hier-
archy of evidence in which randomized clinical trials (RCTs)
occupy the apex of the evidence pyramid, with observational
analyses relegated to lower levels. An accompanying body of
folklore known as good clinical practice has accumulated
around organizational and operational aspects of RCTs. Such
trials, however, cannot answer every clinical question, and bu-
reaucracyengenderedbycommoninterpretationsofgoodclini-
cal practice has driven the costs of traditional regulatory RCTs
to such levels that many important questions are effectively
unanswerable within the existing clinical research ecosys-
tem. For example, many regulated RCTs expend substantial
resources auditing data that may not be essential to the result
of the trial at a cost that far exceeds the value in obtaining a
reliable answer to the primary questions posed by the trial.3
The shortcomings of traditional regulatory RCTs have long
been debated.4 During the past few decades, however, alter-
native approaches for understanding the effects of specific
therapies have evolved. Recently, Frieden5 pointed out that as
analytical methods continue to improve, confidence in the
value of observational analyses should correspondingly
increase.
