pleural mesothelioma (MPM) accounts for 90%-95% of all 
 
cases, with the epithelioid type occuring most frequently (50%-
67%) (1). It is a relatively rare tumor whose incidence in West-
ern Europe is predicted to increase until 2018-2019, related to 
the widespread use of asbestos in the past (2). At present, no 
standardized therapeutic protocol is available due to the high 
rate of relapse and limited survival. Currently, chemotherapy 
can improve survival (3), whereas the role of early surgery in 
offering a significant chance of prolonged survival in selected 
cases is still discussed (4).
Several biomarkers have been suggested as tools for 
screening and early diagnosis of MPM, including soluble me-
sothelin-related protein (SMRP), plasma osteopontin (pOPN) 
and serum vimentin. Several studies have focused on SMRP 
and pOPN and their role in MPM diagnosis (5-10). Moreover,

ABSTRACT
Introduction: Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is a relatively rare tumor, with the epithelioid type occur-
ring more frequently. Several biomarkers have been suggested for screening and early diagnosis of MPM. Cur-
rently, high levels of soluble mesothelin-related peptides (SMRP), plasma osteopontin (pOPN) and vimentin have 
been reported in patients with MPM as promising markers for diagnosis, but their clinical use in monitoring is 
still discussed. The aim of our study was to evaluate the usefulness of these substances as markers of the clinical 
response to treatment in patients suffering from epithelioid mesothelioma.
Methods: 219 serum samples from 56 patients were collected during follow-up and the clinical response to 
therapy was recorded. Percentage differences between 2 consecutive measurements of SMRP, osteopontin 
and vimentin (Δ markers) by means of commercially available kits were correlated with changes in the clinical 
course.
Results: Δ SMRP, Δ pOPN and Δ vimentin showed statistically significant differences between the disease catego-
ries stable disease, partial response and disease progression (p = 0.0001, p = 0.035 and p = 0.0025 for SMRP, pOPN 
and vimentin, respectively). Moreover, contingency table analysis showed statistically significant differences be-
tween clinical response and Δ of each marker clustered into 3 groups (<-20%, between -20% and +20%, >+20%).
Conclusions: The time course of Δ SMRP and Δ vimentin was strongly associated with disease status, and so 
was the time course of pOPN, albeit to a lesser extent. These markers appear to be particularly effective in 
cases of partial response and disease progression, while their possible use in stable disease should be better 
investigated.

these markers were also investigated in clinical monitoring 
of MPM. Robinson et al (6) first observed that SMRP levels 
decreased after debulking surgery, which was confirmed by 
Wheatley-Price (11) and Hollevoet et al (12), although on a 
small number of cases. In contrast to mesothelin, which de-
creases shortly after resection, pOPN increases, probably 
because of its role in tissue remodeling (12). Furthermore, 
osteopontin levels were less closely associated with the ra-
diological response than mesothelin. The role of vimentin in 
the response to treatment was never analyzed, even if vimen-
tin has been widely used as a diagnostic immunohistochemi-
cal marker for MPM (13).
The aim of our study was therefore to evaluate changes 
in the levels of SMRP, pOPN and vimentin in relation to the 
course of the disease.
Materials and methods
Patients
This study was performed according to the Helsinki Dec-
laration and was approved by the ethics committee of the 
University of Pisa.
Fifty-six MPM patients (82.1% males) were enrolled among 
those admitted to the University Hospital of Pisa for diagnosis 
and/or therapy. All patients suffered from histologically con-
firmed epithelioid MPM. Exclusion criteria were non-epithelioid 
variants of MPM and previous or current malignant diseases 
other than MPM.
Two hundred nineteen serum samples were obtained 
from all patients and stored at -80°C. In each patient blood 
samples were collected every time they underwent a clini-
cal checkup during which disease was restaged. A total of 
161 time segments between 2 consecutive serum collections 
were used to evaluate whether biomarker trends paralleled 
changes in disease stage (according to RECIST, see below). The 
aim of our research was to test the utility of some biomarkers 
as indicators of response to therapy through an experimen-
tal design reproducing routine clinical situations. The clinical 
pathway after a diagnosis of pleural mesothelioma provides, 
in fact, different monitoring steps, based mainly on radiologi-
cal investigations, after the provision of different personalized 
therapeutic treatments. For this reason, the association be-
tween marker levels and treatment response was assessed 
in individual time segments, regardless of the patient and the 
type of therapeutic treatment. In our study, more time seg-
ments per patient were analyzed, with an average of about 
3 per patient. In some of the patients with more than 1 time 
segment analyzed, clinical responses were different for differ-
ent time segments.
Clinical data
For each patient, we recorded smoking status, asbestos 
exposure, date of diagnosis, stage according to the Inter-
national Mesothelioma Interest Group (IMIG) classification 
(14), date of death (if any), or date of last contact with the 
patient. Clinical disease course was defined according to 
the modified response evaluation criteria in solid tumors 
(RECIST) (15). According to the modified RECIST, a complete 
response to therapy (CR) was defined as disappearance of 
all target lesions; a partial response (PR) was defined as re-
duction by almost 30% of neoplastic disease as assessed 
by computed tomography (CT); disease progression (DP) 
was defined as an approximately 20% increase in neoplas-
tic disease or the appearance of new lesions. Patients with 
stable disease (SD) are not defined by previous criteria. 
None of the study patients showed CR. RECIST classifica-
tion was performed by an operator blinded to blood test 
assessment.
Biomarker assay
SMRP levels were measured using a MESOMARK kit 
 
(Fujirebio Diagnostics, Inc.), a sandwich enzyme-linked immu-
nosorbent assay (ELISA) quantitative test (16), according to 
the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, patient serum sam-
ples were diluted 1:100 with the assay diluent. Next, 100 µL 
 
of blank, provided standards and samples were applied in du-
plicate in a microwell plate precoated with 4H3 antibody. After 
1 hour of incubation on a shaking plate at room temperature, 
the wells were washed and OV569-HRP antibody was added 
for 1 hour. After a second washing step, TMB substrate solu-
tion was added to the wells for 15 minutes, then 100 µL of 
stop solution was added. Absorbance read at 450 nm was used 
 
to quantify the SMRP concentration in nM by comparison of 
the mean of the duplicate measurement with a calibration 
curve fitted by the CourbesRD software (Installshield Corpora-
tion, Inc.).
The Human Osteopontin Assay Kit (IBL), a commercially 
available ELISA kit, was used to determine the level of pOPN. 
Briefly, plasma samples were diluted 1:10 with EIA buffer and 
100 µL of blank, standards and samples were applied in dupli-
cate in an O-17 antibody-precoated microwell plate and incu-
bated for 1 hour at 37°C. The plate was washed 8 times and 
100 µL of labeled 10A16 antibody was added to each well. 
After incubation for 30 minutes at 4°C, the plate was washed 
9 times and chromogen was added. The plate was incubated 
for 30 minutes at room temperature in the dark and stop so-
lution was added. Adsorbance read at 450 nm was used to 
quantify the osteopontin concentration in ng/mL by compari-
son with the standard curve plotted by a graphic log-log in 
Microsoft Excel.
The concentration of vimentin in serum samples was 
detected by a competitive ELISA kit (MyBioSource, cat. 
MBS721933) using a monoclonal anti-VIM antibody and 
VIM-HRP conjugate. The assay was performed according to 
the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, samples (1:10 di-
lution) and standards (ranging from 1 to 25 ng/mL) were 
incubated together with VIM-HRP conjugate in a precoated 
plate for 1 hour. After incubation the wells were decanted 
and washed 5 times. The wells were then incubated with 
HRP enzyme substrate, the reaction was stopped, and the 
color intensity was measured at 450 nm in a microplate 
reader. The detection limit was better than 0.1 ng/mL of 
 
sample.
All biomarkers were analyzed as percentage changes be-
tween 2 consecutive blood collections (Δ) in order to evaluate 
marker change. All tests were performed by a biologist who 
was blind to the clinical data.

Statistical analysis
All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 19.0. 
Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to analyze differ-
ences in marker percentages between disease categories 
(SD, DP and PR). Data were reported as mean and standard 
deviation, median and 10th-90th percentiles. The chi-square 
test was performed to evaluate the correlation between 
marker change (Δ) and clinical disease course. The study 
population was clustered into 3 Δ groups for each marker 
(<-20%, between -20% and +20%, >+20%) and, only for 
SMRP, also 9 groups (variation of 20% from -60% to +80%). 
Fisher’s exact test was used when the analyzed groups com-
prised fewer than 5 cases. A p value <0.5 was considered 
statistically significant. The Kaplan-Meier survival curve us-
ing the log-rank test was applied to evaluate the prognostic 
value of SMRP levels at time of diagnosis, using the best 
cutoff of 1 nM (10).
Results
The demographic and clinical data of all patients are re-
ported in Table I. Of the 56 enrolled MPM patients, 25 had 
early-stage disease (stage I/II), 16 had advanced disease 
(stage III/IV), and 15 were incompletely staged.
Marker changes and clinical response
SMRP
Δ SMRP showed statistically significant differences be-
tween disease categories (SD, PR, DP; p<0.0001). Eighty-two 
time segments from SD patients showed a Δ SMRP mean 
of +23.61% ± 85.20%, 30 time segments from PR patients 
showed a Δ SMRP mean of -20.55% ± 54.88%, and 49 time 
 
segments from DP patients showed a Δ SMRP mean of 
114.73% ± 168.74%. Case distribution in SD, PR and DP is 
shown in Figure 1. Contingency table analysis showed sta-
tistically significant differences (p = 0.0001) between clinical 
response (SD, PR and DP) and Δ SMRP clustered in 3 and 9 
groups as shown in Tables IIA and IIB, respectively.
pOPN
In a subgroup of MPM patients (18 cases and 47 time seg-
ments), Δ pOPN was analyzed in the 3 different clinical course 
groups, showing a significant difference with a p value of 
0.034 (Δ pOPN mean and standard deviation: -13.72 ± 66.23, 
-9.68 ± 94.41 and 133.41 ± 300.17 for SD, PR and DP, respec-
tively), as shown in Figure 2. Plasma OPN values in PR cases 
decreased by almost 20% in as many as 83.3% of patients, 
while in DP cases these values increased only in 41.7%.
Vimentin
In 16 MPM patients with 27 time segment changes, serum 
vimentin was analyzed in the 3 groups showing a significant 
p<0.0001 (5.11 ± 10.04, -43.63 ± 15.53 and 45.91 ± 17.51 for 
SD, PR and DP, respectively), as shown in Figure 3. Regarding 
vimentin, all PR cases decreased by almost 20%, while in DP 
cases vimentin increased in 60.0% of the group. Median and 
10th-90th percentiles of the percentage changes are present-
ed in supplementary Table S1 (Summary of results: clinical re-
sponse and Δ markers clustered in 3 groups, with median and 
10th/90th percentiles of the percentage of changes, for each 
line. NA was indicated in case of paucity of subjects. Available

Discussion
MPM patients have a poor prognosis with an extremely 
low 5-year survival rate. There are currently no useful tools 
for screening and early diagnosis, while clinical monitoring is 
based mainly on radiological tests. Moreover, evaluation of 
therapy response in MPM remains difficult, especially because

of the poor sensitivity and operator dependency of radiologi-
cal assessment (4). In addition, in most cases relapse is char-
acterized by a very rapid time course.
Despite the need for new markers of therapy response, 
up to now only SMRP has been suggested by a few authors. 
Among these, Hassan et al (17) also demonstrated that SMRP 
remained stable in patients who did not respond to chemo-
therapy, suggesting its use as a marker for monitoring the 
 
response to  
therapy. In a descriptive analysis of a series of 
 
37 patients with epithelioid MPM, Grigoriu et al (18) showed 
that increased SMRP levels were associated with disease pro-
gression and poor prognosis, while stable or decreased values 
correlated with response to treatment irrespective of the type 
of therapy. Recently, Wheatley-Price et al (11), dividing MPMs

in 3 groups with variations of SMRP of about 10%, showed 
that changes in the percentage of the marker level may play a 
role in the clinical evaluation of disease course. In that study, 
41 nonsarcomatoid mesothelioma cases (2 peritoneal and 39 
pleural) were analyzed for the accordance between SMRP lev-
el variations and response to therapy evaluated by both the 
RECIST and modified RECIST criteria, revealing a statistically 
significant association with both. The results from that study 
obtained by measuring SMRP in plasma matrices were very 
interesting, although the kit used for the experiments, MESO-
MARK, is strongly recommended only for serum matrix.
In our study, we analyzed serum samples strictly according 
to the manufacturer’s instructions, using samples exclusively 
from epithelioid MPM cases, and we followed the modified 
RECIST criteria for the evaluation of change in disease status. 
Actually, there is a considerable body of literature demon-
strating that only the epithelioid histological type is associated 
with increases in the serum SMRP concentration. Moreover, 
we considered only SMRP changes of about 20%, given the 
total imprecision of the MESOMARK ELISA kit ranging from 4% 
to 11% (16).
According to the adopted criteria for disease regres-
sion, a decrease in SMRP was observed in 63% (as many 
as 19 out of 30) of PR time segments. Yet it is notewor-
thy that regardless the extent up to 80% (24/30), the total 
PR segments were associated with a decrease in the SMRP 
concentration. Regarding the 49 time segments of DP, the 
trend was even more evident, given that 79.6% (as many 
as 39/49) had increased SMRP values over +20%. SMRP 
measurements ranging between -20% and +20% showed 
a less significant correlation with SD, since only 29 of 82 
stable time segments (35.4%) fell within the expected 
 
range.
SMRP was able to detect DP cases with a sensitivity of 
79.6% and a specificity of 74.4%, and to detect PR cases with 
a sensitivity of 63% and a specificity of 80%.
According to the SMRP results, we found that both pOPN 
and vimentin were significantly associated with disease course. 
Regarding pOPN divided into 3 groups, in 29 time segments 
of SD, Δ pOPN ranged between -20% and +20% in 51.7% of 
cases (n = 15), while the remaining 48.3% were equally dis-
tributed between an increase to more than +20% and a de-
crease to less than -20%. In PR time segments (n = 6), only 
 
1 case (16.7%) increased over 20%, while the remaining 5 cas-
es (83.3%) decreased by almost 20%. Finally, in 12 DP time seg-
ments, Δ pOPN increased in 41.7% of cases (n = 5), decreased 
in 50% (n = 6), and ranged between -20% and +20% in 8.3% of 
cases (n = 1).
When Δ vimentin was clustered into 3 groups, in 14 SD 
time segments, 50% (n = 7) of cases ranged between -20% and 
+20%, 28.6% (n = 4) decreased, and 21.4% (n = 3) increased. 
In the PR situation, 100% of time segments (n = 3) decreased 
by almost 20%. In 10 cases of DP, only 1 time segment (10%) 
was decreased, 3 time segments (30%) were comprised 
between -20% and +20%, and the remaining 60% of cases 
 
(n = 6) increased over 20%.
Despite the paucity of cases, pOPN but especially vi-
mentin followed the disease course. As for SMRP, pOPN and 
vimentin were not clearly distributed in case of SD. This dif-
ficulty could be due to our choice to set Δ markers in 20% 
variations, since minor variations in percentage could better 
describe SD cases.
In conclusion, our data showed that in patients with epi-
theloid mesothelioma, SMRP, vimentin and (albeit to a less-
er extent) pOPN change in parallel with disease status. Our 
results therefore suggest these substances could be useful 
as additional markers in monitoring the clinical course of 
MPM, although further studies are needed to evaluate if 
marker changes may also have predictive significance.
