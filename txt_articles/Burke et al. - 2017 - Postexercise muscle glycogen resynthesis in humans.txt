conducted in the 1960s in which glycogen status was investigated using the muscle
biopsy technique, sports scientists have developed a sophisticated appreciation of
the role of glycogen in cellular adaptation and exercise performance, as well as sites
of storage of this important metabolic fuel. While sports nutrition guidelines have
evolved during the past decade to incorporate sport-specific and periodized manip-
ulation of carbohydrate (CHO) availability, athletes attempt to maximize muscle
glycogen synthesis between important workouts or competitive events so that fuel
stores closely match the demands of the prescribed exercise. Therefore, it is
important to understand the factors that enhance or impair this biphasic process. In
the early postexercise period (0–4 h), glycogen depletion provides a strong drive
for its own resynthesis, with the provision of CHO (~1 g/kg body mass) optimizing
this process. During the later phase of recovery (4–24 h), CHO intake should meet
the anticipated fuel needs of the training/competition, with the type, form, and
pattern of intake being less important than total intake. Dietary strategies that can
enhance glycogen synthesis from suboptimal amounts of CHO or energy intake are
of practical interest to many athletes; in this scenario, the coingestion of protein
with CHO can assist glycogen storage. Future research should identify other factors
that enhance the rate of synthesis of glycogen storage in a limited time frame,
improve glycogen storage from a limited CHO intake, or increase muscle glycogen
supercompensation.

SEMINAL WORK in the 1960s, using the percutaneous needle
biopsy technique to excise small samples of human skeletal
muscle, made it possible to conduct invasive studies of metab-
olism and determine the impact of training, diet, and other
manipulations on selected biochemical, metabolic, histologi-
cal, and contractile characteristics (for review, see Ref. 41).
Several studies identified muscle glycogen as a major deter-
minant of endurance exercise capacity (10, 12, 80) and an
inability to continue exercise when the glycogen stores were
restricted (43). Furthermore, several days of diet-exercise ma-
nipulation resulted in “supercompensated” muscle glycogen
levels that, in turn, translated into significant improvements
in performance of a “real-life” endurance event (54). Since
then, our knowledge about muscle glycogen has expanded to
include roles such as fuel sensor, regulator of intracellular
signaling pathways promoting exercise training adaptation,
and mediator of the osmotic characteristics of the muscle
cell (38, 39, 50, 65, 81).
Current sport nutrition guidelines recognize that glycogen
availability can be strategically manipulated to promote out-
comes ranging from enhanced training adaptation to optimal
performance. Indeed, the reader is directed to recent reviews
regarding strategies to enhance the cellular response to an
exercise stimulus through training with low carbohydrate
(CHO) availability (6, 38). The aim of the current minireview,
however, is to revisit scenarios in which a performance benefit
is associated with matching muscle glycogen stores to the fuel
requirements of training or competition. We highlight recent
advances in our understanding of the optimal nutritional
strategies to promote rapid and effective restoration of this
important muscle substrate and describe some of the molec-
ular signals by which glucose transport is increased in the
exercised muscle after strenuous exercise. The reader is also
referred to previous comprehensive reviews on these topics
(13, 50, 52).

 General Background
Competitive endurance athletes undertake a prodigious vol-
ume of training with a substantial amount of exercise per-
formed at intensities that are close to or faster than race pace
(115). As such, preparation for and competition in endurance
exercise events lasting up to 3 h are dependent on CHO-based
fuels (muscle and liver glycogen, blood glucose and blood
muscle, and liver lactate) to sustain high rates of muscle energy
production (16, 57, 75, 106). However, the body’s reserves of
CHO are not as plentiful as those of lipids or proteins, so an
important goal of the athlete’s daily diet is to provide the
trained musculature with the substrates necessary to fuel the
training program that supports optimal adaptation and recov-
ery.
Rates of postexercise glycogen synthesis have been investi-
gated using a variety of exercise protocols and dietary regi-
mens. Depletion of muscle glycogen provides a strong drive
for its own resynthesis (116). Indeed, even in the absence of
postexercise CHO intake, glycogen synthesis occurs at rates of
1–2 mmol·kg wet wt of muscle�1·h�1 through gluconeogenesis
(61), or, particularly in the case of high-intensity exercise,
lactate (44). However, postexercise CHO ingestion is the most
important determinant of muscle (and liver) glycogen synthe-
sis, with the highest rates of resynthesis (typically within the
range of 5–10 mmol·kg wet wt�1·h�1) observed when large
amounts of CHO are consumed soon after the completion of
the exercise bout, and then continued throughout recovery.
Several factors contribute to the enhanced synthesis rates
during the first 2 h after exercise: these include activation of
glycogen synthase by glycogen depletion (83) as well as
exercise-induced increases in insulin sensitivity (87) and per-
meability of the muscle cell membrane to glucose. Neverthe-
less, with a mean glycogen storage rate of 5–6 mmol·kg wet
wt�1·h�1, 20–24 h of recovery are normally required for
normalization of muscle glycogen levels following extreme
exercise depletion (30). This scenario provides a challenge to
athletes who undertake multiple sessions of training in a 24-h
period (e.g., swimmers, rowers, or distance runners) or com-
petition (e.g., tournament tennis, cycling tour) with �12–15 h
recovery from the first session, after which muscle glycogen
content is likely to be reduced by at least 50% (102).
CHOs, Glucose Transport, and Glycogen Storage in Human
Skeletal Muscle
Glucose, fructose, and galactose are the primary monosac-
charides in the human diet having an energy value of 15.7 kJ/g
and producing ~38 mol of ATP/mol monosaccharide. The most
important monosaccharide for muscle metabolism is glucose,
which is phosphorylated to glucose 6-phosphate by the enzyme
hexokinase and either directed toward glycolysis or glycogen
synthesis. Glycogen synthase catalyzes the incorporation of
UDP-glucose through �-1–4-glycosidic linkages into the ex-
panding glycogen polymer, with branching enzyme catalyzing
formation of �-1,6-branchpoints (31). The many branching
points formed by the �-1,6 bonds (approximately every
8–12 glucose units) on the glycogen molecule provide
multiple sites for the addition of glucose residues during
glycogen synthesis (glycogenesis), or glycogen breakdown
during exercise (through glycogenolysis).
Until the discovery of the protein glycogenin as the mech-
anism for glycogen biogenesis (101), the source of the first
glycogen molecule that acted as a primer in glycogen synthesis
was not known. Glycogenin is located at the core of the
glycogen molecules and is characterized by autocatalytic ac-
tivity that enables it to transfer glucose residues from UDP-
glucose to itself (3). Before glycogenin is able to synthesize a
glycogen molecule, it must form a 1:1 complex with glycogen
synthase (101). Glycogenin then initiates granule formation by
the addition of 7–11 glucose residues to a single tyrosine
residue on the protein, which serves as a substrate for glycogen
synthase. The branching enzyme and glycogen synthase then
act in concert to catalyze the formation of two distinct pools of
glycogen: proglycogen (PG) and macroglyocgen (MG) (59,
60). In the initial stages of glycogen formation, the PG granules
grow by the addition of glucose residues forming the larger
mature MG. PG and MG contain the same amount of protein
but differ in the number of glycogen units and also in their rates
of degradation and synthesis (1, 3, 95). It appears that PG is
more sensitive to dietary CHO and is synthesized more rapidly
following exercise-induced glycogen depletion, reaching a pla-
teau after 24 h (1). The synthesis of MG is a relatively slower
process, persisting for 48 h postexercise (1). The different rates
of synthesis of the PG and MG granules explain, in part, the
biphasic pattern of postexercise glycogen storage (52) and
demonstrate that the amount of glycogenin has a direct influ-
ence on how much glycogen the muscle cell can store. Factors
that influence glycogenin concentrations are largely unex-
plored and required investigation.
In the period after glycogen-lowering exercise, glycogen
synthesis is a key priority for the previously contracted mus-
cles, and glycogen synthase activity and glucose transport are
increased dramatically to meet this obligatory requirement.
Indeed, an enhanced metabolic action of insulin in skeletal
muscle (glucose transport, glycogen synthase activity, glyco-
gen synthesis) is observed after glycogen-depleting exercise
(85), which can persist for up to 48 h (67). It is this enhanced
insulin sensitivity in skeletal muscle that, in large part, con-
tributes to the restoration and, depending on the degree of prior
glycogen depletion, even a “supercompensation” of muscle
glycogen stores. While the molecular mechanisms involved in
postexercise increased insulin sensitivity are not fully under-
stood (50), the magnitude of postexercise glycogen depletion
has been strongly linked to the enhanced metabolic action of
insulin in this period (85).
Glycogen stores in human muscle (and liver) vary and are
largely determined by the training status of the individual and
their habitual CHO intake (42). The resting muscle glycogen
content of an untrained person consuming a mixed diet is
~80–85 mmol/kg of muscle wet wt and somewhat higher at
~120 mmol/kg wet wt for individuals undertaking regular
endurance-type exercise training (12). After exhaustive glyco-
gen-depleting exercise and with 36–48 h of a high (�8 g/kg
body mass)-CHO diet, muscle glycogen content can be super-
compensated (11), reaching 200 mmol/kg wet wt (97). Because
1 g of glycogen is stored in muscle with 3–5 g of water (76,
98), an athlete’s body mass typically increases 1–2% after
several days of “CHO loading” (12). Whereas skeletal muscle
glycogen stores provide between 300 and 700 g of glycogen
(depending on the active musculature), a smaller amount of
glycogen is stored in the liver, providing ~100–120 g glycogen

 in an average 75-kg male. Despite the relative small amounts
of glycogen stored in the liver, it is the only endogenous source
of glucose that directly regulates blood glucose homeostasis.
Indeed, in the absence of exogenous CHO ingestion, hypogly-
cemia will occur when liver glycogen stores become depleted.
However, when CHO is ingested during exercise, liver glyco-
gen is typically maintained (17, 34). Few studies have deter-
mined the impact of CHO ingestion on postexercise repletion
of liver glycogen (33) and brain glycogen (64), and these are
beyond the scope of the present review.
Recently, the role and regulation of muscle glycogen have
been specified to be dependent on its subcellular localization
(74). With the use of transmission electron microscopy, studies
undertaken in the 1970s and 1980s revealed both fiber-type
differences and a localization-dependent utilization of glyco-
gen during exercise. A quantitative approach (62) has identi-
fied three distinct subcellular locations of glycogen: 1) inter-
myofibrillar glycogen in which glycogen particles are located
between the myofibrils next to sarcoplasmic reticulum and
mitochondria, 2) intramyofibrillar glycogen where glycogen
particles are located within the myofibrils between the contrac-
tile filaments, and 3) subsarcolemmal glycogen whereby gly-
cogen particles are located from the outermost myofibril to the
surface membrane. The implications of these distinct pools of
glycogen for glycogen resynthesis, muscle function, and fa-
tigue resistance are of key interest but require further investi-
gation before practical recommendations can be made to ex-
ploit this knowledge. The remainder of this review will focus
on factors that influence muscle glycogen synthesis and strat-
egies that can be used by athletes to enhance muscle glycogen
storage, with particular relevance to scenarios in which condi-
tions for glycogen storage are suboptimal (brief time periods
between exercise sessions and/or the inability to consume
adequate CHO intake).
Dietary CHO Intake and Muscle Glycogen Synthesis
Under most conditions, dietary CHO represents the main
substrate for muscle glycogen synthesis, with factors such as
the quantity, timing, and type of CHO intake markedly influ-
encing the rate of muscle glycogen storage.
Amount of CHO intake. Synthesizing data from a range of
studies that have monitored glycogen storage over 24 h fol-
lowing exercise-induced depletion, including two dose-re-
sponse studies (19, 28), a “glycogen storage threshold” appears
to occur at a daily CHO intake of ~7–10 g/kg body mass (24).
Specific attention has been focused on the early (0–4 h) phase
of recovery because of the slightly higher muscle glycogen
synthesis rates during this time, as well as the practical issues
of the multiday exercise programs undertaken by athletes.
Initial guidelines recommended that athletes consume 50 g (~1
g/kg body mass) of CHO every 2 h during the early period of
recovery, based on observations of similar rates of postexercise
glycogen storage following CHO intakes of 0.7 and 1.4 g/kg
body mass (15), or 1.5 g and 3.0 g/kg body mass (48) at such
intervals. However, more recent work (33, 82, 109, 111) has
reported 30–50% higher rates of glycogen synthesis (10–11
mmol·kg wet wt�1·h�1) over the first 4 h of recovery with
larger CHO intakes (e.g., �1 g·kg�1·h�1), at least when CHO
is consumed as repeated small feedings. Thus, when immediate
postexercise refueling is a priority, current guidelines promote
larger intakes of CHO in patterns of frequent consumption.
Timing of CHO intake. The popular concept of a “window of
opportunity” for postexercise refueling was created by a well-
publicized study (47) that reported that immediate intake of
CHO after prolonged exercise resulted in higher rates of
glycogen storage (7.7 mmol·kg wet wt�1·h�1) during the first
2 h of recovery than when this same feeding was delayed after
2 h (~4.4 mmol·kg wet wt�1·h�1). Although these data show
more effective glycogen synthesis during early postexercise
recovery, the key finding of that study was that glycogen
synthesis rates remained very low until CHO feeding was
initiated. Thus, immediate provision of CHO to the muscle cell
should be seen as a strategy to initiate effective refueling rather
than to simply take advantage of a period of moderately
enhanced glycogen synthesis. This has significance when there
is only 4–8 h of recovery between exercise sessions, but a
longer (�8 h) recovery time (78) may compensate for a delay
in the initial feeding. Indeed, the negative feedback loop from
glycogen concentrations on its own synthesis (116) may con-
tribute to the equalization of muscle glycogen content over
time.
The frequency of intake of the recommended amounts of
CHO (e.g., large meals vs. a series of snacks) does not affect
glycogen storage in longer-term recovery, despite marked
differences in blood glucose and insulin responses (21, 28).
This is in apparent conflict to the observations of higher rates
of muscle glycogen synthesis during the first 4–6 h of recovery
when large amounts of CHO are fed at 15- to 30-min intervals
(51, 109, 111). One theory to explain this “paradox” is that the
maintenance of blood glucose and insulin profiles is most
important during the first hours of recovery and perhaps when
total CHO intake is suboptimal. However, during longer peri-
ods of recovery, or when total CHO intake is above this
“threshold,” manipulations of plasma substrates and hormones
within physiological ranges do not confer any additional ben-
efit.
Type of CHO intake. Early studies of single nutrient feedings
showed glucose and sucrose to be more effective than fructose
in restoring muscle glycogen after exercise (15). This con-
firmed the hypothesis that glycogen synthesis is more effective
with dietary CHO sources that elicit higher blood glucose and
insulin responses. However, the results of the first studies of
food-derived CHO were inconsistent (28, 88) because of the
misuse of the structural classification of “simple” or “complex”
to predict the glycemic impact of CHO-rich foods. The subse-
quent use of published glycemic index (GI) foods to construct
postexercise diets found that glycogen storage was increased
during 24 h of recovery with a CHO-rich meal based on
high-GI foods compared with an identical amount of CHO
eaten in the form of low-GI foods (22). However, the magni-
tude of increase in glycogen storage (~30%) was substantially
greater than the difference in 24-h blood glucose and insulin
profiles, particularly because the immediate postexercise meal
produced a large glycemic and insulinemic response, indepen-
dent of the GI of the CHO consumed. Other studies have
confirmed greater gut glucose release and greater hepatic
glucose output in response to meals immediately postexercise,
favoring an increase in muscle glucose uptake and glycogen
storage (91). The malabsorption of some very-low-GI CHO-
rich foods was postulated to account for less efficient glycogen

 storage by reducing the effective amount of CHO consumed;
this is supported by observations of lower postexercise glyco-
gen storage from a poorly digestible high-amylose starch
mixture compared with intake of glucose, maltodextrins, and a
high amylopectin starch (53). Finally, a drink containing a
special glucose polymer of high molecular weight and low
osmolarity was found to enhance glycogen synthesis in the first
2 h of recovery, although this effect disappeared thereafter
(82). This benefit was attributed to a faster rate of gastric
emptying (58) and may point to the benefits of foods that are
rapidly digested and emptied when more rapid glycogen res-
toration is needed. Nevertheless, in other studies, solid and
liquid forms of CHO-rich foods have been found to be equally
effective in providing substrate for muscle glycogen synthesis
over 2–24 h (55, 84). Indeed, direct comparison with intrave-
nous administration of matched concentrations of glucose in
one investigation showed that gastric emptying of foods/drinks
was not the rate-limiting process for glycogen synthesis. A
separate study, which found that intravenous delivery of sup-
raphysiological concentrations of glucose and insulin can in-
crease rates of postexercise glycogen synthesis over 8 h to
levels achieved by glycogen supercompensation protocols
(37), is largely of theoretical interest only since its use contra-
venes antidoping rules in sport.
Effect of Other Dietary Factors on Glycogen Synthesis
Although dietary CHO intake has the most robust effect on
muscle glycogen synthesis, rates of glycogen storage may be
manipulated by other nutrients or nutrition-related factors.
Outcomes of this knowledge can be used to increase glycogen
storage by employing strategies to increase muscle glycogen
synthesis rates when conditions are suboptimal (e.g., when
total CHO intake is below targets set for maximal synthesis
rates or when the refueling period is limited) or by avoiding
factors that can interfere with optimal muscle glycogen syn-
thesis.
Energy intake/energy availability. There is increasing aware-
ness that suboptimal intake of energy in relation to exercise
energy expenditure (termed relative energy deficiency in sport)
results in an impairment of energy-requiring activities involved
in body maintenance and health such as protein synthesis, bone
turnover, or hormone pulsatility (69). It is intuitive that glyco-
gen storage could be decreased in the face of inadequate energy
intake, either by a downregulation of the energetics of glyco-
gen synthesis or the reduced availability of glucose for storage
because of demands for immediate oxidation. Indeed, there is
evidence that the relationship between dietary CHO and gly-
cogen storage is underpinned by total energy intake. For
example, glycogen supercompensation protocols were reported
to be less effective in female than male athletes (103), but this
finding was later reinterpreted as an outcome of the relatively
lower energy intake in the female cohort (104). In the latter
study, female subjects showed a substantial enhancement of
muscle glycogen storage associated with increased dietary
CHO intake only after total energy intake was also increased
(104). It should be noted that these studies involved a 4-day
glycogen-loading protocol and did not collect data that
would explain the mechanism of energy-related glycogen
storage changes. Therefore, we are left to speculate whether
this is an acute issue related to alternate fates for exogenous
CHO when energy intake is suboptimal and/or a more
chronic suppression of glycogen synthesis in the face of low
energy availability.
Coingestion of other macronutrients. The coingestion of
other macronutrients, either present in CHO-rich foods or
consumed at the same meal, may directly influence muscle
glycogen restoration independent of their effect on energy
intake. Factors that may directly or indirectly affect glycogen
storage include the provision of gluconeogenic substrates, as
well as effects on digestion, insulin secretion, or the satiety of
meals. Protein has received most attention, since an insulino-
tropic amino acid and/or protein mixture can augment post-
prandial insulin release and stimulate both glucose uptake and
glycogen synthase activity in skeletal muscle tissue (26, 113),
thus further accelerating muscle glycogen synthesis. Indeed
there is evidence that this occurs when amino acids and/or
protein are coingested with CHO below the threshold for
glycogen storage (e.g., 0.5–0.8 g CHO·kg�1·h�1) (9, 45, 46,
111, 112, 117). However, as discussed by Betts and Williams
(13), when CHO intake is adequate (e.g., �1 g·kg�1·h�1), the
coingestion of protein has no further effect on glycogen syn-
thesis (8, 51, 109). Protein intakes of around 0.3–0.4 g/kg
appear to maximize this effect (13); this is also considered the
optimal amount to promote muscle protein synthesis goals
(68). The effects of coingesting fat with CHO-rich meals on
postexercise glycogen storage have not been systematically
investigated. In the only available study involving endurance
sport, the addition of fat and protein (0.4 g/kg and 0.3 g/kg
body mass per meal, respectively) to a diet containing adequate
CHO to achieve maximal glycogen storage over 24 h of
refueling failed to increase rates of glycogen synthesis despite
markedly different responses in blood glucose and free fatty
acid concentrations (19).
The consumption of large amounts of alcohol is of interest
since this practice often occurs in the postcompetition period,
particularly in team sports. Separate studies of 8 and 24 h
recovery from glycogen-depleting exercise in well-trained cy-
clists who consumed ~120 g alcohol (equal to 12 standard
drinks) have been undertaken (20). Muscle glycogen storage
was reduced during both recovery periods when alcohol dis-
placed an energy-matched amount of CHO from a standard
recovery diet. Evidence for a direct effect of elevated blood
alcohol concentrations on muscle glycogen synthesis was un-
clear, but it appeared that, if an immediate impairment of
glycogen synthesis existed, it might be compensated by ade-
quate CHO intake and longer recovery time (20).
Other dietary agents that promote glycogen storage. A
range of other dietary substances has been studied in relation to
their potential to accelerate the rates of muscle glycogen
storage or increase glycogen storage from a given amount of
CHO, through mechanisms including increased muscle glucose
uptake and insulin sensitivity as well as an enhancement of
cellular signaling events. With regard to the latter issue, short-
term supplementation with creatine monohydrate to increase mus-
cle total creatine content has been shown to upregulate the mRNA
content of select genes and proteins involved in a range of cellular
activities, including glycogen synthesis, with the suggested
mechanism being a change in cellular osmolarity (93). Table 1
summarizes studies of glycogen storage in relation to exercise
which prior or simultaneous creatine supplementation has been
undertaken and includes investigations in which an increase in

 glycogen storage has been observed in muscle that has been
creatine loaded (32, 71, 77, 90, 100). Although it is not a
universal finding, Sewell and colleagues (94) postulated that
the glycogen-depleting or “muscle-sensitising” effect of exer-
cise is needed to achieve the stimulatory effect of creatine
loading on postexercise glycogen loading. Recently, Roberts et
al. (88) reported a greater increase in postexercise muscle
glycogen storage following creatine (20 g/day) supplementa-
tion in addition to a high-CHO diet. The greater postexercise
increase in muscle glycogen became evident as early as 24 h
after exercise and was maintained following 6 days of postex-
ercise recovery on a CHO-rich diet. Although the mecha-
nism(s) underlying this observation remains to be elucidated, it
seems evident that creatine supplementation can further aug-
ment muscle glycogen storage. However, it remains to be
established whether this effect occurs in highly trained athletes.
Furthermore, the practical implications of any benefits of
creatine use to refueling in endurance athletes should be
weighed against the 1–2% gain in body mass that is associated
with creatine loading.
Here it should also be noted that changes in muscle water
content secondary to the whole body fluid changes experienced
by athletes (i.e., hyperhydration and, more commonly, dehy-
dration) could also alter glycogen synthesis due to changes in
cell osmolarity and cell volume. This has not been systemati-
cally addressed, although an early study investigated the effect
of dehydration on glycogen synthesis, based on the hypothesis
that the binding of water to glycogen might make cellular
hydration a permissive factor in muscle glycogen storage (72).
This study found that dehydration equivalent to loss of ~5%
body mass or 8% body water did not interfere with glycogen
storage during 15 h following cycling exercise, although mus-
cle water content was lower than in the trial involving euhy-
drated recovery. Further investigation is warranted (72).
Other dietary constituents with purported effects on insulin
sensitivity and glucose tolerance have been investigated in
relation to muscle glycogen storage in various trained and
untrained human populations. Studies have shown varying
effects of caffeine use on muscle glycogen storage in trained
individuals. In one investigation, intake of caffeine (8 mg/kg)
with CHO (1 g·kg�1·h�1) resulted in substantially higher rates
of muscle glycogen storage over 4 h of recovery (79). How-
ever, another study (7) found no difference in muscle glycogen
synthesis when an hourly caffeine intake of 1.7 mg·kg�1·h�1
was added to large CHO feedings (1.2 g·kg�1·h�1) for a
postexercise recovery period of 6 h. There is no apparent
explanation for the discrepancy in these findings, and the
practicality of using caffeine as a postexercise refueling aid
must also be questioned in view of its interruption to sleep
patterns.
Isolated studies (Table 1) have reported enhancement of
muscle glycogen storage following the use of the insulin
mimetic fenugreek [containing the unique amino acid 4-hy-
droxyleucine, conjugated linoleic acid and hydoxycitric acid
(found in Garcinia Cambogia fruit)]. However, these findings
have not been replicated. For example, although muscle gly-
cogen synthesis during 4 h of recovery was found to be
enhanced when an extract isolated from fenugreek was added
to a high dose of dextrose (92), a subsequent investigation from
the same group failed to find any refueling advantages after 4
or 15 h of postexercise recovery when this product was
consumed in combination with CHO (99). Therefore, it would
be premature to consider these ingredients as an aid to accel-
erate muscle glycogen recovery for competitive athletes.
Nondietary Issues: Effects on Glycogen Storage
The effects of muscle damage from the prior exercise bout
need to be considered in the context of refueling. In particular,
rates of glycogen synthesis are impaired after muscle-damag-
ing eccentric contractions and/or impact injuries because of
reductions in GLUT4 translocation (5) and reduced glucose
uptake (4). Early laboratory-based work from Costill and
colleagues reported that isolated eccentric exercise (29) or
exhaustive running (14) was associated with reduced rates of
muscle glycogen restoration during 24 and 72 h of postexercise

exercise taper, deleting the depletion phase,

letes in the latter study (96). More recent

 recovery, with a time course suggesting that this phenomenon
did not occur in the early phase (0–6 h) of recovery but was
associated with later recovery (114). Although these findings
are generally attributed to damage to muscle fibers and local
inflammation, glycogen synthesis in damaged muscles might
be partially overcome by increased amounts of CHO intake
during the first 24 h after exercise (29). Of course, few studies
have followed the time course of muscle glycogen recovery
after real-life sporting activities. Several investigations of re-
covery from competitive soccer have reported a delay in
glycogen restoration following football matches (36, 49, 56)
such that it remained below resting levels after 24 h of recovery
in both type 1 and type 2 fibers and after as much as 48 h of
recovery in type 2 fibers despite relative high CHO intakes
(36). Although these findings are generally attributed to the
eccentric component of the movement patterns in soccer (sud-
den changes in direction and speed) and direct contact between
players, an intervention within one study also found rates of
glycogen storage below rates normally associated with recov-
ery from cycling exercise when simulated soccer activities of
different duration were undertaken with the removal of the
body contact and a reduction in eccentric movements (36).
Therefore, further observations of muscle glycogen recovery
following competitive sports events is warranted, including the
investigation of mechanisms that could explain attenuated
muscle synthesis rates.
Because athletes frequently undertake specialized activities
after competition or key training sessions to promote various
aspects of recovery, it is of interest to consider how such
practices might interact with glycogen storage goals. For ex-
ample, therapies that alter local muscle temperature to alleviate
symptoms of exercise-induced muscle damage appear to have
some effect on factors that are important in muscle glycogen
synthesis although the overall effect is unclear. In one study,
intermittent application of ice reduced net glycogen storage
over 4 h of recovery compared with a control leg (108),
whereas, in a companion study by the same laboratory, the
application of heat was associated with greater refueling (100).
Table 2. Guidelines for promoting postexercise glycogen storage by athletes (23, 24, 105)
Time Period/Scenario
Evidence-Based Guidelines
Optimal storage of glycogen following or between
glycogen-limited workouts/events (early phase
0–6 h)
• When the period between exercise sessions is �8 h, the athlete should consume CHO
as soon as practical after the first workout to maximize the effective recovery time.
• Early postexercise recovery (0–4 h) may be enhanced by a higher rate of CHO intake
(~1 g·kg body mass�1·h�1), especially when consumed in frequent small feedings.
• CHO-rich foods with a moderate–high GI provide a readily available source of
substrate for glycogen synthesis. This may be important in situations where maximum
glycogen storage is required in the hours after an exercise bout. Foods with a low GI
appear to be less effective in promoting glycogen storage. However, this may be partly
because of poor digestibility that overestimates actual CHO intake and may be
compensated by additional intake of these foods, or the addition of foods with a high
GI to meals and snacks.
• Adequate energy availability is required to optimize glycogen storage from a given
amount of CHO.
• The selection of CHO-rich foods and drinks, or the combination of these in meals and
snacks, should be integrated with the athlete’s other nutritional goals related to
recovery (e.g., rehydration, muscle protein synthesis).
• Athletes should follow sensible practices regarding alcohol intake at all times but
particularly in the recovery period after exercise. Excessive intake of alcohol after
exercise may directly inhibit glycogen storage during the period of elevated blood
alcohol concentration. However, the most important effects of alcohol intake on
refueling (and other recovery issues) are through a reduced ability, or interest, to
implement sports nutrition goals and sensible lifestyle choices.
Optimal glycogen storage over 24 h to meet fuel
requirements of upcoming events or workouts
where it is important to perform well and/or
with high intensity
• Targets for daily CHO intake are usefully based on body mass (or proxy for the volume
of active muscle) and exercise load. Guidelines can be suggested but need to be fine
tuned according to the athlete’s overall dietary goals and feedback from training.
o Moderate exercise load: 5–7 g·kg�1·24 h�1
o Heavy exercise load: 6–10 g·kg�1·24 h�1
o Extreme exercise load: 8–12 g·kg�1·24 h�1
• During longer recovery periods (6 h�) when the athlete can consume adequate energy
and CHO, the types, pattern, and timing of CHO-rich meals and snacks can be chosen
according to what is practical and enjoyable. In these circumstances, it does not seem
to matter whether CHO is consumed as meals or frequent snacks, or in liquid or solid
form, as long as sufficient CHO is consumed.
• The selection of CHO-rich foods and drinks, or the combination of these in meals and
snacks, should be integrated with the athlete’s other nutritional goals related to general
health and performance (e.g., nutrient density, energy requirements) as well as ongoing
recovery goals.
Enhanced glycogen storage when the athlete is
unable to consume adequate energy or CHO to
optimize glycogen storage (e.g., poor appetite,
restrained eater, low energy availability)
• The addition of protein to CHO-rich meals and snacks may promote glycogen storage
when CHO intake is suboptimal especially during the first hours of recovery. An intake
of ~20–25 g of high-quality protein appears to optimize this effect while also meeting
goals for postexercise muscle protein synthesis.
Glycogen supercompensation before endurance
events of �90 min of sustained or intermittent
high-intensity exercise
• In the absence of muscle damage, a CHO intake of 8–12 g·kg�1·24 h�1 for 36–48
h in combination with exercise taper can supercompensate muscle glycogen
concentrations.

 Alterations in blood flow to the muscle secondary to temper-
ature changes were presumed to play a role in these findings,
although a reduction in muscle enzyme activities was also
suspected to be a factor in explaining the outcomes of ice
therapy. However, another study of cold-water immersion
following exercise failed to find evidence of impaired glycogen
storage during the recovery period (35). Therefore, the benefits
of postexercise application of cold or heat on muscle glycogen
repletion following exercise remains to be addressed in future
research.
Glycogen Supercompensation
Strategies to achieve glycogen supercompensation have
slowly evolved since the first description of this phenomenon
in the pioneering studies of Bergström and coworkers (2,
10–12, 43). These researchers (using themselves as subjects)
showed that several days of a low-CHO diet followed by a
similar period of high-CHO intake resulted in a localized
doubling of muscle glycogen concentrations in muscle that had
been previously depleted of glycogen through exercise. From
this finding emanated the “classical” 7-day model of CHO
loading, involving a 3- to 4-day “depletion” phase of hard
training and low-CHO intake, finishing with a 3- to 4-day
“loading” phase of high-CHO eating and exercise taper. A
subsequent field study (54) and documented implementation by
successful athletes illustrated its benefits to performance of
distance running and cemented CHO loading in the practice
and language of sports nutrition for endurance sports (18).
Surprisingly, there have been few refinements of this poten-
tially valuable technique, despite the fact that it was derived
from observations on active but essentially untrained individ-
uals. These increments in knowledge are shown in Fig. 1.
A decade later, Sherman and colleagues showed that well-
trained runners were able to supercompensate muscle glycogen
stores with 3 days of taper and a high-CHO intake, regardless
of whether this was preceded by a depletion phase or a more
typical diet and training preparation (97). This “modified” and
more practical CHO loading protocol avoids the fatigue and
complexity of extreme diet and training requirements associ-
ated with the previous depletion phase. A more recent update
on the time course of glycogen storage found that it increased
significantly from ~90 mmol to ~180 mmol/kg wet wt with 24
h of rest and high-CHO intake and thereafter remained stable
despite another 2 days of the same conditions (25). Although
the authors concluded that this was an “improved 1-day CHO
loading protocol” (25), the true loading phase from the last
training session was ~36 h. In essence, the study provides a
midpoint to the glycogen storage observations of Sherman and
colleagues (97) and suggests that supercompensation is prob-
ably achieved within 36–48 h of the last exercise session, at
least when the athlete rests and consumes adequate CHO
intake. Of course, it is not always desirable for athletes to
achieve total inactivity in the days before competition, since
even in a taper some stimulus is required to maintain previ-
ously acquired training adaptations (70).
An athlete’s ability to repeat glycogen supercompensation
protocols has also been examined. Well-trained cyclists who
undertook two consecutive periods of exercise depletion, fol-
lowed by 48 h of high-CHO intake (12 g·kg�1·day�1) and rest,
were found to elevate their glycogen stores above resting levels
on the first occasion but not the next (66). Further studies are
needed to confirm this finding and determine why glycogen
storage is attenuated with repeated CHO loading.
Implications for Athlete Practice
Current sports nutrition guidelines no longer promote a
universal message of “high-CHO intakes at all time” or the
need to maximize muscle glycogen storage. Indeed CHO
requirements may be low on days or for athletes where a
light/moderate training load has only a modest requirement for
glycogen utilization or replacement (23). Intakes may be sim-
ilarly low when there is a deliberate decision to undertake
exercise with low glycogen stores to induce a greater skeletal
muscle adaptive response (6), and there may even be benefits
from deliberately withholding CHO after a high-quality train-
ing session to minimize glycogen restoration and extend the
period during which adaptive responses are elevated (63).
Nevertheless, there are numerous real-life scenarios in which
Table 3. High-priority areas for further research on postexercise glycogen storage by athletes
• Can dietary strategies alter the restoration of the glycogen stores in various cellular locations, and which is more important for performance outcomes?
• What is the role of glycogenin as a permissive or limiting factor for glycogen storage, and can it be manipulated?
• Can various dietary strategies enhance muscle glycogen storage from suboptimal amounts of CHO intake by manipulating more favorable blood glucose
and insulin concentrations?
o Manipulation of pattern of intake of meals and snacks
o Choice of CHO-rich foods with high glycemic and insulinemic responses
• Can dietary compounds with insulin mimetic activity enhance muscle glycogen storage?
• Can caffeine increase muscle glycogen storage when consumed in modest amounts that are consistent with other health or recovery goals (e.g., lack of
interference with sleep)?
o What is the mechanism of action of any positive effect?
• Can prior or concurrent supplementation with creatine enhance muscle glycogen concentration in well-trained athletes?
o What is the mechanism of action of any positive effect?
o Under what conditions does the effect of enhanced muscle fuel stores overcome the weight gain associated with creatine loading?
• Is the positive effect of any such dietary components/manipulations to enhance glycogen storage achieved by increasing glycogen synthesis from a given
amount of dietary CHO, increasing the rate of muscle glycogen storage over a given time, and/or increasing total muscle glycogen storage capacity or level
of supercompensation?
• Does reduced glycogen storage during energy restriction/low energy availability reflect downregulation of glycogen storage and/or lack of substrate?
• What is the mechanism of the failure to repeat glycogen supercompensation in close succession, and can it be overcome?
• What is the mechanism of delayed resynthesis of glycogen following some sporting activities, and can it be overcome?
• Do other recovery activities that affect muscle blood flow or temperature enhance or impair muscle glycogen storage?
• How can the impairment of glycogen storage by muscle damage be attenuated?
• Are there special issues for different athlete populations, for example, athletes with disabilities, adolescents, and masters athletes?

 athletes want to optimize muscle glycogen storage, either by
accelerating the rates of glycogen synthesis, by promoting
greater storage from a given amount of dietary CHO, or by
increasing the total muscle glycogen pool. These include su-
percompensating muscle glycogen stores before an endurance/
ultraendurance event (e.g., preparation for a marathon), nor-
malizing muscle glycogen for shorter games/events within the
weekly training microcycle (e.g., weekly or biweekly soccer
game), rapidly restoring muscle glycogen between two events
or key training sessions held �8 h apart (two matches within
a tennis tournament or a swimmer’s twice daily workouts), and
maximizing muscle glycogen storage from a diet in which
energy intake is restricted (an athlete on a weight loss program,
restrained eater, or an athlete in a weight-making sport).
Current sports nutrition guidelines for muscle glycogen stor-
age, summarized in Table 2, provide recommendations for both
short-term (e.g., 0–6 h after glycogen-depleting exercise) and
longer-term (12–48 h) refueling (23, 105). Although these
strategies provide useful practices for many athletes, they are
biased toward conditions in which the athlete is able to con-
sume large/optimal amounts of CHO. A range of questions that
can extend our current knowledge on muscle glycogen synthe-
sis in more practical ways is provided in Table 3.
