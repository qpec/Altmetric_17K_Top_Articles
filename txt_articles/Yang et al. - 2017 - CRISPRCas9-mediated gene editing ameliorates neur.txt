Introduction
Expansion of a CAG/glutamine repeat in various genes causes at 
least 9 different neurodegenerative diseases, including Huntington’s 
disease (HD). In HD, the expanded CAG repeat encodes a polyglu-
tamine (polyQ) tract in the N-terminal region of huntingtin (HTT) 
and leads to a wide range of cellular dysfunctions (1). The gain of 
toxic function of mutant huntingtin (mHTT) has led to considerable 
efforts to use siRNA, antisense oligonucleotides, or CRISPR/Cas9 to 
selectively suppress the expression of mHTT (2–4). Indeed, siRNA 
and antisense oligonucleotides have shown promising therapeutic 
effects in HD mice that express transgenic mHTT (2, 5). However, 
this relies on SNPs that are specific to the mutant allele. Also, wheth-
er this strategy can be successfully used in HD mice that express 
mHTT at the endogenous level remains unknown, since normal and 
expanded alleles of the endogenous Htt gene are not readily distin-
guished by siRNA and antisense oligonucleotides (6).
Our recent studies using conditional Htt-KO mice revealed that 
depletion of normal HTT in adult mouse brains does not affect ani-
mal survival, growth, or neuronal viability (7). In addition, knockin 
(KI) mice that express N-terminal mHTT have shown that the N-ter-
minal region of HTT is not essential for early embryonic develop-
ment (8). These findings suggest that removal of N-terminal HTT 
containing the polyQ domain, regardless of its allele, could be a 
potential therapeutic strategy to treat HD. Here, we report that per-
manent suppression of the endogenous expression of mHTT via 
CRISPR/Cas9 in the striatum of HD140Q-KI mice, which express a 
human HD HTT, can effectively deplete HTT aggregates and early 
neuropathology, even after the formation of abundant HTT aggre-
gates. Reducing HTT expression in striatal neuronal cells does not 
affect the viability of the adult HD140Q-KI mice, but alleviates their 
motor deficits and neurological symptoms. Our findings suggest that 
depletion of HTT via CRISPR/Cas9 in a non–allele-specific manner 
can efficiently and permanently eliminate polyQ expansion–medi-
ated neuronal toxicity in the adult brain. This also opens up a new 
avenue for treating other neurodegenerative diseases caused by the 
gain-of-function mechanism.
Results and Discussion
To delete the polyQ domain of mHTT using CRISPR/Cas9, we 
designed 4 guide RNAs (gRNAs) to target the DNA regions (T1, 
T2, T3, and T4) flanking the CAG repeat in exon 1 of human HTT 
(Figure 1A and Supplemental Figure 1A; supplemental mate-
rial available online with this article; https:/
/doi.org/10.1172/
JCI92087DS1). We transfected HEK293 cells stably expressing 
exon 1 of human HTT containing 120 CAG repeats with each of 
the 4 gRNAs and Cas9. Western blotting showed a reduction of 
mHTT in the transfected cells (Supplemental Figure 1, B and C). 
We also tested the activities of combining 2 HTT-gRNAs in the sta-
ble HEK293 cells. A combination of T1 and T3 HTT-gRNAs led to 
the greatest reduction in mHTT (Supplemental Figure 1, D and E) 
and was used for our subsequent studies.
We next tested the effect of CRISPR/Cas9-mediated HTT 
depletion in HD140Q-KI mice. In this KI mouse model, exon 1 
of human HTT with 140 CAG repeats replaces exon 1 of endog-
Huntington’s disease is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by a polyglutamine repeat in the Huntingtin gene (HTT). 
Although suppressing the expression of mutant HTT (mHTT) has been explored as a therapeutic strategy to treat 
Huntington’s disease, considerable efforts have gone into developing allele-specific suppression of mHTT expression, given 
that loss of Htt in mice can lead to embryonic lethality. It remains unknown whether depletion of HTT in the adult brain, 
regardless of its allele, could be a safe therapy. Here, we report that permanent suppression of endogenous mHTT expression 
in the striatum of mHTT-expressing mice (HD140Q-knockin mice) using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated inactivation effectively 
depleted HTT aggregates and attenuated early neuropathology. The reduction of mHTT expression in striatal neuronal cells in 
adult HD140Q-knockin mice did not affect viability, but alleviated motor deficits. Our studies suggest that non–allele-specific 
CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing could be used to efficiently and permanently eliminate polyglutamine expansion–
mediated neuronal toxicity in the adult brain.

Western blotting verified that RFP and Cas9 were predominantly 
expressed in the injected striatum (Supplemental Figure 2B).
We injected AAV-HTT-gRNA and AAV-CMV-Cas9 into one 
side of the striatum in homozygous HD140Q-KI mice at the age 
of 3 or 9 months. The contralateral striatum was injected with 
AAV-HTT-gRNA or AAV-CMV-Cas9 alone, which allowed us to 
rigorously examine the efficiency of HTT-gRNA/Cas9–mediat-
ed mHTT knockdown. HD140Q-KI mice are known to develop 
age-dependent motor deficits and nuclear accumulation of mHTT 
(9, 14). We found that most of the striatum and the needle path-
way in the cortex and hippocampus were transduced by AAVs 3 
weeks after injection (Figure 1B). Western blotting showed that 
enous mouse Htt (9), resulting in the expression of full-length 
mHTT with 140Q under the control of the endogenous mouse Htt 
promoter. In HD140Q-KI mice, accumulated mHTT in striatal 
neuronal nuclei is detectable between 4 and 6 months and forms 
obvious aggregates at 9 to 10 months (8, 10–12). We focused on 
the striatum to investigate the effect of removing mHTT. Two 
gRNAs (T1 and T3) are expressed under the U6 promoter in an 
adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector that also expresses red fluo-
rescent protein (RFP) (AAV-HTT-gRNA), and Cas9 is expressed in 
another AAV vector under the CMV promoter (AAV-CMV-Cas9) 
(13). The 2 viruses were mixed at a ratio of 1:4 for stereotaxic injec-
tion into mouse striatum (Supplemental Figure 2A). After 3 weeks,

astrocytes. We also checked several other proteins such as NeuN 
(a neuronal marker), p62 (an autophagy marker) and caspase 3 (an 
apoptosis marker), which are frequently studied in neurodegener-
ative diseases, and found that these proteins remained unchanged 
(Figure 1C and Supplemental Figure 2C). The results were corrob-
orated by immunohistochemical studies using GFAP and NeuN 
antibodies (Supplemental Figure 3, A and B).
Most HD patients are heterozygous for the HD gene muta-
tion. Also, neurons are preferentially affected in HD. Thus, we 
tested the therapeutic potential of CRISPR/Cas9 in heterozygous 
HD140Q-KI mice, using AAV-HTT-gRNAs (T1 and T3) with AAV-
Cas9 that was expressed under the neuronal methyl-CpG–binding 
protein (Mecp2) promoter (AAV-MECP2-Cas9) (Figure 2A). As a 
control, AAV-control-gRNA with AAV-MECP2-Cas9 were used. 
These viruses were mixed at a ratio of 1:4 (gRNA/Cas9) and inject-
HTT-gRNA, but not control-gRNA, caused a significant reduc-
tion of mHTT in the striatum of 9-month-old HD140Q-KI mice 
(Figure 1C and Supplemental Figure 2C). Compared with the 
contralateral striatum injected with HTT-gRNA alone, immuno-
staining revealed a dramatic decrease in the nuclear accumulation 
and aggregation of mHTT in the HTT-gRNA/Cas9–injected stri-
atum (Figure 1D). Double immunofluorescence staining further 
verified that the decrease in mHTT staining is dependent on the 
expression of HTT-gRNA (Figure 1E). In HD KI mouse brain, a 
well-known early neuropathology is reactive astrocytes (15, 16). 
In brain regions transduced by HTT-gRNA/Cas9, attenuation of 
the increased glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) was associated 
with knockdown of mHTT compared with brain regions inject-
ed with control-gRNA/Cas9 (Figure 1C and Supplemental Fig-
ure 2C), indicating that a reduction of mHTT alleviated reactive

KI mice. We were able to obtain 24 nine-month-old heterozygous KI 
mice for examination, at which age the mice show abundant nuclear 
accumulation of mHTT in striatal neurons and also develop obvi-
ous motor dysfunction. These KI mice were injected with either 
AAV-HTT-gRNA/AAV-MECP2-Cas9 or AAV-control-gRNA/AAV-
MECP2-Cas9, and their behaviors were monitored for 3 months. 
In HD140Q-KI mice, motor dysfunction has been well document-
ed using rotarod, balance beam, and grip strength tests (9, 17). We 
found that HTT-gRNA/Cas9 could significantly improve perfor-
mance in these tests and alleviate the motor deficits of HD140Q-KI 
ed into both sides of the striatum of 9-month-old heterozygous 
HD140Q-KI mice to maximize the therapeutic effects. Immunos-
taining of the injected striatum revealed the presence of RFP in 
dopamine- and cAMP-regulated phosphoprotein as well as dopa-
mine- and cAMP-regulated neuronal phosphoprotein (DARPP-32) 
(Figure 2B) and NeuN-positive (Supplemental Figure 4) neurons, 
indicating that medium spiny neurons in the striatum had been 
transduced by the injected AAVs.
We examined whether CRISPR/Cas9-mediated neuronal 
mHTT depletion had any impact on the motor function of HD140Q-

obvious motor deficit phenotypes (8, 10–12). Our findings revealed 
that CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene inactivation could reverse the 
neuropathology and behavioral phenotypes, even when the mice 
were 9 months old, suggesting that old neuronal cells still have the 
ability to clear the accumulated mutant proteins and repair early 
injury once the expression of mutant proteins is blocked. Thus, 
reducing mHTT expression in the brains of elder HD patients 
might still be effective in alleviating neurological symptoms.
Given that CRISPR/Cas9 can permanently eliminate the 
expression of targeted genes, using CRISPR/Cas9 should more 
efficiently deplete the expression of mHTT than has been possible 
with previous therapeutic approaches, which require continuous 
administration. Also, the severe neurological symptoms of many 
neurodegenerative diseases are often associated with the prefer-
ential vulnerability of selective neuronal populations. The use of 
specific promoters allows CRISPR/Cas9 to target specific types 
of neurons. Thus, using CRISPR/Cas9 to inhibit mutant protein 
expression in specific brain regions opens up a new avenue for 
treating HD as well as other neurodegenerative diseases that are 
caused by a toxic gain of function of mutant genes.

mice compared with control-gRNA/Cas9–injected KI and WT mice 
(Figure 2C). In addition, knocking down HTT expression also atten-
uated body weight reductions (Figure 2C). The efficiency of mHTT 
reduction in the striatum varied among the individual mice tested 
(Supplemental Figure 5A). We found that the percentage of mHTT 
reduction in each mouse correlated with its rotarod and balance 
beam performance (Supplemental Figure 5, B and C).
Many studies have shown rare off-targets when specific gRNAs 
are used (18, 19). Whole-genome sequencing analysis using genom-
ic DNA extracted from HTT-gRNA/Cas9–injected striatum veri-
fied that genomic mutations predominantly occurred around the 
HTT-gRNA targeted sequences in the Htt gene, but not in potential 
off-target loci (Supplemental Figure 6). This result was further cor-
roborated by a T7E1 assay showing a lack of DNA mutations in select-
ed potential off-target loci (Supplemental Figure 7A). In addition, 
DNA sequencing confirmed the presence of frameshift mutations 
around the targeted region of the HTT-gRNA (Supplemental Figure 
7B). Western blotting analysis of individual injected mice showed an 
obvious reduction of mHTT in the striatum and part of the cortex 
containing the injection pathway compared with mHTT levels in the 
hippocampus (Figure 3, A and C). Double immunostaining confirmed 
a specific reduction of mHTT by HTT-gRNA, but not control-gRNA, 
in the injected striatal area (Figure 3, B and C). Furthermore, AAV-
MCEP2-Cas9, which selectively depleted HTT in neuronal cells, 
could also reduce reactive astrocytes but did not alter expression of 
the neuronal marker NeuN (Figure 3, D and E). We also examined 
striatal volume and brain weight and did not find significant differ-
ences between HTT-gRNA– and control-gRNA–injected HD140Q-
KI mice (Supplemental Figure 8). These results suggest that neuronal 
mHTT causes early neuropathology to increase reactive astrocytes in 
HD140Q-KI mouse brains, which could be diminished by eliminat-
ing the expression of HTT. Taken together, removal of endogenous 
HTT in neuronal cells via CRISPR/Cas9 can efficiently alleviate 
mHTT-mediated neuropathology in HD140Q-KI mice.
Although shutting off the expression of transgenic mHTT can 
alleviate neurological symptoms in HD mice (20, 21), whether 
reducing the expression of endogenous HTT can be used to treat 
HD without deleterious effects remains unknown. When we used 
homozygous HD140Q-KI mice in which 2 alleles of the mHTT 
gene could be disrupted by CRISPR/Cas9, we found that removal 
of HTT did not affect the expression of NeuN or caspase 3. Instead, 
mHTT depletion significantly reduced reactive astrocytes, an ear-
ly pathological event in HD KI mouse brains (15, 16). The results 
also support our recent findings that depletion of endogenous 
mouse HTT in adult neurons is nondeleterious and that the func-
tion of HTT is cell type and age dependent (7). Using heterozygous 
HD140Q-KI mice to further analyze their pathology and behav-
iors, we also verified that CRISPR/Cas9 could effectively alleviate 
HD-related phenotypes. At the age of 9 months, HD140Q-KI mice 
show abundant nuclear mHTT accumulation in the striatum and
