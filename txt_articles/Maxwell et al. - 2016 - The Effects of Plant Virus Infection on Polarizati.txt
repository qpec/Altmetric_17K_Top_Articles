Abstract
Alteration of leaf surface phenotypes due to virus infection has the potential to affect the
likelihood of colonisation by insect vectors, or to affect their feeding activities. The aim of
this study was to investigate whether viruses that rely on insects for their transmission, and
which can be sensitive to the polarization of light, affect the percentage polarization of light
reflected from leaves. We also set out to discover whether a correlation exists between the
expression of ECERIFERUM (CER) genes involved in cuticular wax synthesis and the polar-
ization of the light reflected from the leaf surfaces. It was found that the aphid-vectored
viruses Potato virus Y and Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) caused significant reductions in
the percentage polarization of light reflected from the abaxial surfaces of leaves of Nicotiana
tabacum, whereas the non-insect-vectored viruses Tobacco mosaic virus and Pepino
mosaic virus did not induce this effect. In Arabidopsis thaliana, there was little difference in
the impacts of CMV and the non-insect-vectored Turnip vein clearing virus on polarization
reflection, with both viruses increasing the percentage polarization of light reflected from the
abaxial surfaces of leaves. There was a trend towards increased accumulation of CER6
transcripts in N. tabacum and A. thaliana when infected with aphid-vectored viruses. No sig-
nificant effect of infection on trichome densities was found in A. thaliana, suggesting that
alterations to the formation of cuticular waxes may be the more likely phenotypic change on
the leaf surface contributing to the changes in polarization reflection. The possible impacts
and adaptive significance of these effects with regard to viral transmission by insects are
discussed.
Introduction
The majority of vector-transmitted plant viruses are spread between host plants by insects,
such as aphids, whiteflies and thrips [1]. In an adaptive context viruses are not passive players
during transmission, and have been shown to alter plant and vector interactions in ways that
enhance viral transmission strategies [2–8]. A review of the literature by Mauck et al. (2012)

 found that the effects of plant viruses on vector behaviour, mediated through the impacts of
infection on host plant phenotypes, are generally conducive to transmission [2]. In both persis-
tently transmitted (PT) (with the virus remaining infective on the vector from several hours to
days, and requiring sustained aphid feeding for acquisition and inoculation on to plants) and
non-persistently transmitted (NPT) (where the virus is only retained briefly on the insect and
is acquired or inoculated during brief probing of the plant epidermal cells by aphids) [1,9]
viruses function to increase the initial attractiveness of infected plants to vectors [2], although a
small number of studies report preferential attraction of aphids to healthy plants [10,11].
Plant viruses can affect the attraction of insect vectors through modified olfactory signals
[3–5,12,13]. Changes to the nutritional quality of infected plants are also thought to affect
aphid feeding and settlement [4,14,15] and differences in vector feeding behaviours on virus-
infected plants in comparison to on healthy plants have been reported [5,6,16]. Changes to the
structure of leaf surfaces have received little attention in comparison and virus-induced alter-
ations to the leaf surface could affect the tactile perception of a leaf by insects. Changes to the
cuticular waxes can affect the recognition of host plants by aphids [17] and leaf hairs (tri-
chomes) can interfere with insect movement and settlement [18]. Additionally, the visual
appearance of the leaf could be altered, as surface features such as cuticular waxes and tri-
chomes are a key determinant of reflectance properties; in particular the reflection of polarized
light [19–21]. Whether plant viruses alter leaf surface phenotypes in ways which could influ-
ence polarization reflection has never been addressed.
Sensitivity to the polarization of light is a common visual ability across the animal kingdom
[22]. Many species of insect have polarization-sensitive visual systems [23] and use the polari-
zation pattern of the sky for navigation (e.g. bees [24], ants [25,26] and dung beetles [27]), the
polarization cue from water for locating habitats (e.g. dragonflies [28]),polarization signals for
flower identification (in bees [29]) and possibly discrimination of egg-laying and feeding sites
(in butterflies [30,31]). To our knowledge, polarization sensitivity has never been investigated
in the common hemipteran insects which act as plant viral vectors (e.g. aphids and whiteflies),
but the few studies that have investigated the architectures of the aphid eyes indicate that they
possess a typical apposition compound eye with a fused rhabdomeric photoreceptors and the
interesting inclusion of a separate structure called the triommatidium that contains only three
facets and is situated on lateral tubercles [32]. Therefore if, like many other insects with apposi-
tion type eyes that possess polarization sensitivity (see above) the viral vectors are polarization
sensitive, then it is a plausible hypothesis that virus-induced alterations to polarization reflec-
tions from leaves could affect the visual attractiveness of infected plants.
The leaves of plants have the ability to polarize reflected light across a range of viewing
angles for obliquely incident light and any reflections are predominately linearly polarized at
an angle parallel to the plane of the leaf surface [33]. The angle of polarization refers to the pre-
dominant angle of oscillation of light’s electric field vector, whilst the degree of polarization,
often expressed as a percentage polarization, denotes the extent to which the light is polarized;
in fully linearly polarized light the wave’s oscillation is confined to one plane, whereas in par-
tially polarized light there is distribution in angles of individual waves, about a measurable
mean [21]. When light is incident at Brewster’s angle (around 55 degrees from the vertical for a
leaf in air) onto a smooth surface, the reflected light can approach being 100% polarized. How-
ever, the surface roughness is a key determinant of the polarizing properties of the leaf surface;
smoother surfaces reflect with a higher percentage polarization than rougher surfaces [19,21].
As such, the structure of the leaf, for example its microtopology, greatly influences the polariza-
tion of any reflections [19,21]. In contrast, light reflected from the leaf interior undergoes mul-
tiple scattering and has a much lower percentage polarization than the surface-reflected light
[33]. The net percentage polarization reflection from a leaf results from the relative

 contributions of surface-derived and internally-derived reflectance [21], as well as the angle of
view and illumination.
Epicuticular waxes, which comprise the outermost layer of the leaf cuticle, are an important
determinant of polarization reflection properties [21] and changes to these provide a possible
mechanistic pathway by which viruses can alter a polarization dimension to a visual signal.
The synthesis of alkanes, aldehydes, secondary alcohols, ketones, primary alcohols and wax
esters, which make up the epicuticular waxes, and are derived from very long chain fatty acids
(VLCFAs), occurs in the epidermal cells [34]. In Arabidopsis thaliana, the best characterised
genes involved in wax synthesis are the ECERIFERUM (CER) genes, including CER6, which
encodes a condensing enzyme that catalyses the extension of VLCFA chains by two carbon
increments [35]; CER5, an ABC transporter involved in the movement of waxes across cell
membranes [36]; CER8, which facilitates the extension of fatty acids through the addition of
CoA [37]; CER3, which catalyses the conversion of long chain fatty acyl-CoAs to alkanes [38];
CER7, a positive regulator of CER3 [39]; and CER9, a ubiquitin ligase which is thought to nega-
tively regulate leaf wax accumulation [40]. If viruses that use insects as a vector are able to
adaptively alter the visual signals broadcast by infected plants, then we would hypothesize
expression levels of CER genes would be altered to modify the epicuticular waxes and therefore
change the reflective polarization properties of the infected host leaves. Moreover, viruses that
do not use insects as a vector should not orchestrate the same changes.
In this work, we aimed to test these suggested hypotheses. We measured the percentage
polarization of light reflected from leaves of Nicotiana tabacum infected with Potato virus Y
(PVY) and Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) (aphid-borne viruses) and Tobacco mosaic virus
(TMV) and Pepino mosaic virus (PepMV) (non-insect-transmitted viruses) respectively. Fur-
thermore, we analysed levels of expression of several CER genes involved in cuticular wax syn-
thesis. Similar approaches were carried out in A. thaliana, using the non-insect-transmitted
Turnip vein clearing virus (TVCV) and aphid-borne CMV. Finally, the effects of viral infection
on trichome densities were also compared between healthy and infected A. thaliana leaves to
indicate whether variation in trichome numbers may also influence any alterations to polariza-
tion of the reflection.
Results
Effects of viral infection on polarization reflection from N. tabacum
leaves
The average percentage polarization of light reflected from the adaxial and abaxial surfaces of
N. tabacum leaves infected with the non-insect-vectored viruses Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV)
and Pepino mosaic virus (PepMV), or the aphid-vectored viruses PVY and CMV, was analysed
by polarization imaging (Fig 1).
TMV and PepMV infections (non-insect-vectored viruses)
TMV infection had no significant impact on the percentage polarization of light reflected from
the adaxial or abaxial surfaces of N. tabacum leaves (in the blue channel a decrease of 0.79%, t-
test: t = 0.195, df = 52, P = 0.846; in the green channel a decrease of 2.61%, t-test: t = 1.54,
df = 52, P = 0.13) (Fig 2A).
Similarly, TMV infection did not significantly affect the percentage polarization of light
reflected from the abaxial surfaces (in the blue channel an increase of 2.07%, t-test: t = -1.181,
df = 54, P = 0.243; in the green channel an increase of 1.3%, t = -0.814, df = 54, P = 0.375) (Fig
2A).

 The other non-insect-vectored virus, PepMV, also had no significant effect on the percent-
age polarization of light reflected from the leaves (Fig 2B). Adaxially, the percentage polariza-
tion of light reflected from PepMV-infected leaves was not significantly different to that
reflected from healthy leaves (in the blue channel a decrease of 1.06%, t-test: t = 0.314, df = 52,
P = 0.755; in the green channel an increase of 0.58%, t = 0.58, df = 52, P = 0.723) (Fig 2B). Simi-
larly on the abaxial surfaces, the reflected polarization from the infected leaves was not signifi-
cantly different to healthy leaves (in the blue channel a reduction of 1.06%, t-test: t = 0.285,
df = 60, P = 0.777; in the green channel an increase of 0.58%; t-test, t = -0.244, df = 60,
P = 0.808) (Fig 2B).
PVY and CMV infections (aphid-vectored viruses)
In contrast, the aphid-vectored viruses PVY and CMV both had significant impacts on the per-
centage polarization of light reflected from N. tabacum leaves.

 On the adaxial surfaces, PVY-infected leaves were less polarizing than healthy leaves, by
8.34% and 12.07% in the blue and green channels respectively (independent samples t-test:
blue, t = 2.688, df = 54, P = 0.01; green, t = 4.36, df = 54, P<0.001) (Fig 2C).
Similar decreases in the percentage polarization were also observed from the abaxial sur-
faces of PVY infected leaves; by 5.94% and 5.47% in the blue and green channels respectively
(independent samples t-test: blue, t = 4.09; df = 56, P<0.001; green, t = 4.557, df = 56,
P<0.001) (Fig 2C).
On CMV-infected leaves the percentage polarization of light reflected from the adaxial sur-
face was lower than for healthy leaves, by 3.18% and 2.09% in the blue and green channels
respectively (Fig 2D), although these are not statistically significant differences (Mann Whitney
test: blue, z = -1.176, n = 62, P = 0.24; green, z = -0.936, n = 62, P = 0.349).
However, the abaxial surfaces of CMV-infected leaves were less polarizing than healthy
leaves, by 5.94% and 5.47% in the blue and green channels respectively (Fig 2D) (independent
samples t-test: blue, t = 4.012, df = 64, P<0.001; green, t = 5.1, df = 64, P<0.001)

 Effects of viral infection on expression of wax synthesis genes in N.
tabacum
Due to the influence of leaf surface features on polarization reflection, the effects of TMV,
PepMV, PVY and CMV infections on the expression levels of genes involved in cuticular
wax synthesis were analysed in N. tabacum. The levels of expression of CER3, CER5 and
CER6 transcripts were investigated in leaves systemically infected with TMV, PepMV, PVY
or CMV.
TMV and PepMV infections (non-insect-vectored viruses)
In leaves infected with TMV, CER3, CER5 and CER6 showed non-significant reductions in
transcript levels relative to healthy leaves (one sample t-test: CER3, t = -0.694, df = 3, P = 0.538;
CER5, t = -0.769, df = 3, P = 0.546; CER6, t = -1.603, df = 3, P = 0.207) (Fig 3A).
Similar results were obtained in leaves infected with PepMV (one sample t-test t-test: CER3,
t = -0.296, df = 2, P = 0.795; CER5, t = -1.767, df = 2, P = 0.219; CER6, t = -2.522, df = 2,
P = 0.128) (Fig 3B).

expression between healthy and infected samples (across the three biological replicates), asterisks indicate statistically significant differences between
healthy and infected leaves (*<0.05).

 PVY and CMV infections (aphid-vectored viruses)
Leaves infected with PVY displayed non-significant increases in the abundances of CER3,
CER5 and CER6 transcripts (one sample t-test: CER3, t = 0.308, df = 2, P = 0.787; CER5,
t = 2.51, df = 2, P = 0.129; CER6, t = 2.549, df = 2, P = 0.126) (Fig 3C).
CMV infection caused CER6 to be significantly upregulated, by 1.5 times relative to unin-
fected leaves (one sample t-test: t = 5.584, df = 2, P = 0.031). There was little impact of CMV
infection on the expression levels of CER3 or CER5 (one sample t-test: CER3, t = -0.833, df = 2,
P = 0.493; CER5, t = -0.577, df = 2, P = 0.622) (Fig 3D).
Effects of viral infection on polarization reflection from A. thaliana leaves
Following the investigations in N. tabacum, similar experiments were performed in A. thaliana.
CMV was inoculated onto this host as an example of an aphid-vectored virus, whilst TVCV, a
Tobamovirus, was used as an example of a non-insect-vectored virus (Fig 4 for example
images).
TVCV infection (a non-insect-vectored virus)
On the adaxial surface, the percentage polarization of the reflections from TVCV-infected
leaves were not significantly different to those from healthy leaves, in the blue or green chan-
nels (independent samples t-test: blue, t = 0.937, df = 64, P = 0.352; green, t = -1.232, df = 64,
P = 0.223) (Fig 5A).
In contrast, on the abaxial surfaces the infected leaves polarized the reflections significantly
more in the blue channel (with an 8.17% increase, t-test: t = -3.32, df = 64, P = 0.001). An
increase, although not significantly different, in the percentage polarization was also seen in
the green channel (a 4.22% increase, t-test: t = -1.927, df = 64, P = 0.058) (Fig 5A).
CMV infection (an aphid-vectored virus)
The percentage polarization of light reflected from the adaxial sides of healthy or CMV-
infected leaves was not significantly different (independent samples t-test: blue, t = 1.132,
df = 46, P = 0.264; green, t = 1.621, df = 46, P = 0.112) (Fig 5B).

healthy, TVCV or CMV-infected leaves of A. thaliana on the adaxial or abaxial surfaces at 21 days post

bar.

 However, from the abaxial surfaces there were increases of 7.55% and 6.33% in the percent-
age polarization reflection from CMV-infected leaves, in the blue and green channels respec-
tively (Mann Whitney test: blue, z = -3.114, n = 48, P = 0.002; green, z = -3.361, n = 48,
P = 0.001) (Fig 5B).
Effects of viral infection on expression of wax synthesis genes in A.
thaliana
Following on from the similar analysis above, the accumulation of transcripts of the CER3,
CER5, CER6, CER7, CER8 and CER9 wax synthesis genes in A. thaliana leaves was investigated
by qPCR, in rosette leaves systemically infected with TVCV or CMV.
TVCV infection (a non-insect-vectored virus)
In TVCV-infected leaves, CER5 was significantly downregulated to around half of the level
observed in healthy leaves (one sample t-test: t = -9.046, df = 2, P = 0.012). The CER8 gene also
displayed a marked reduction in transcript abundance, to 0.36 times the level in healthy sam-
ples, although this was not a statistically significant reduction (one sample t-test: t = -3.101,
df = 2, P = 0.09). There was little effect of TVCV infection on CER3 or CER7 expression (one
sample t-test: CER3, t = 0.191, df = 2, P = 0.866; CER7, t = -0.296, df = 2, P = 0.8), whilst CER6
transcripts showed a non-significant reduction in accumulation. CER9 transcript levels showed
a very large variation between replicates, with a non-significant four-fold increase on average
(one sample t-test: t = 2.565, df = 2, P = 0.124) (Fig 6A).
CMV infection (an aphid-vectored virus)
In CMV-infected leaves, the CER6 gene showed an average upregulation in expression by
around 1.5 times, although this is not a statistically significant increase (one sample t-test:
t = 1.059, df = 2, P = 0.401). CER5 showed very little change in transcript accumulation follow-
ing infection (one sample t-test: t = -0.12, df = 2, P = 0.92), and there was also little effect of
CMV infection on the accumulation of CER3 or CER7 transcripts (one sample t-test: CER3, t =
-1.006, df = 2, P = 0.42; CER7, t = -1.741, df = 2, P = 0.279). CMV infection led to a non-

differences between healthy and infected leaves (** P<0.01). A total of 33 TVCV-infected leaves and 24 CMV-infected leaves (from separate plants) were
analysed and compared to similar numbers of healthy leaves. All imaging experiments were performed at 21 DPI on systemically infected rosette leaves.

 significant reduction in CER8 expression, to around 40% of the level observed in healthy leaves
(one sample t-test: t = -3.008, df = 2, P = 0.095). There was a high variation in CER9 transcript
levels; with the average level of CER9 transcript being very similar in CMV-infected leaves to in
uninfected leaves (one sample t-test: t = -0.026, df = 2, P = 0.98) (Fig 6B).
Trichome densities on TVCV and CMV-infected A. thaliana
In addition to changes in wax composition, the percentage polarization reflection from leaves
could also be influenced by the number of trichomes present on the surface. Therefore, the
densities of trichomes were compared between healthy and systemically TVCV or CMV-
infected rosette leaves.
The TVCV infection did not significantly affect the rosette leaf trichome density on the
adaxial (independent samples t-test: t = -0.944, df = 46, P = 0.35) or abaxial (independent sam-
ples t-test: t = -1.693, df = 46, P = 0.1) surfaces (Fig 7A).

 Similarly, the trichome densities of CMV-infected leaves and healthy leaves showed no sig-
nificant differences on the adaxial (independent samples t-test: t = 0.662, df = 46, P = 0.511) or
abaxial (independent samples t-test: t = 0.646, df = 46, P = 0.521) surfaces (Fig 7B).
Discussion
There was a notable difference in the effect of infection with aphid-transmitted and non-
insect-vectored viruses on the percentage polarization of light reflected from systemically
infected N. tabacum leaves. Infections with PVY and CMV, both aphid-vectored viruses,
resulted in a significantly reduced percentage polarization in light reflected from the abaxial
surfaces, whereas the non-insect-vectored viruses TMV and PepMV did not affect the percent-
age polarization of the reflection. On the adaxial surfaces PVY-infected leaves were signifi-
cantly less polarizing than healthy leaves, whereas the decrease on CMV-infected leaves was
not statistically significant.
These observed effects of virus infection on polarization reflection from N. tabacum there-
fore could possibly be associated with the transmission strategy of the virus, tentatively suggest-
ing that viruses may gain adaptive benefits through alterations to leaf polarization reflection. It
is typically observed that infected plants are more attractive to vectoring insects [3], and polari-
zation-sensitive visual systems are common among insects. This is a tentative suggestion at this
stage, as polarization sensitivity has not been demonstrated in viral vectors such as aphids and
whiteflies. However, the widespread prevalence of polarization-sensitivity in insects that, like
aphids, possess apposition compound eyes, makes it possible that aphids are able to perceive
polarized light. Even if this were not the case, highly polarizing leaf surfaces typically reflect a
white (broadband) specular glare [21], masking any underlying colouration (which can be per-
ceived by humans despite our lack of polarization sensitivity), raising the possibility that a leaf
with a lower percentage polarization could be more attractive to an insect simply because the
pigmentation is more apparent, irrespective of the presence of a polarization vision system in
the animal [41]. However, the potential salience of such changes in polarization reflection to
insects in natural environments is not known. Another possibility is that a reduced percentage
polarization affects the behaviour of predators, parasitoids or competitors of the viral vector.
The seven spot ladybird, for example, has polarization-sensitive UV, blue and green photore-
ceptors [42], so an aphid-vectored virus may enhance its own transmission likelihood by influ-
encing polarization reflection in ways which deter this aphid predator.
The percentage polarization reflection from a leaf is greatly influenced by the characteristics
of the leaf surface, although reflection of light from the leaf interior also contributes to the per-
centage polarization reflection [21,33]. However, the PVY and CMV-induced reductions in the
percentage polarization reflection from N. tabacum were observed in both the blue and green
channel light on the abaxial surfaces, suggesting that alterations to surface reflection primarily
underlie these differences. This is because surface-reflected light does not interact with the leaf
pigmentation, and so the polarized component of light resulting from surface reflection is
essentially broadband, or “spectrally flat” [21,33]. Had there been notable differences in the
effects of infection on polarization in different wavebands, it would have suggested that altered
reflectance from the leaf interior was to some extent responsible for the reduced percentage
polarization reflection. It is therefore conceivable that the aphid-vectored viruses may manipu-
late the leaf surface phenotype (including micro-topography and epicuticular waxes, as dis-
cussed below) in order to alter the suitability or perception of the host plant to an insect vector.
PVY and CMV are both NPT viruses [43,44], and as such would likely benefit from a reduced
colonisation or feeding time by the vector because NPT viruses require rapid transfer between

 hosts for successful transmission, due to the transient association of virus particles with the
aphid mouthparts [1,9].
In contrast to CMV-infected N. tabacum, CMV-infected A. thaliana leaves were signifi-
cantly more polarizing than healthy leaves on the abaxial surface. Furthermore, infection with
TVCV, a non-insect-vectored virus, also increased the abaxial percentage polarization reflec-
tion (in blue channel light). Comparing these viruses, there were therefore no differences asso-
ciated with virus transmission strategy in the effects of virus infection in A. thaliana. It may be
the case that the effects of viruses on polarization reflection are adapted to particular hosts, as it
has been suggested that the induction of similar symptoms across a variety of hosts could arise
as non-adaptive by-products of the infection process [45]. The abaxial surfaces of A. thaliana
rosette leaves are unlikely to act as a useful visual cue for insects as they are located at ground
level, although the colonisation of vectoring insects may be affected by an altered surface struc-
ture because whiteflies and aphids preferentially feed from the lower surfaces of leaves. It was
on the abaxial surfaces of infected N. tabacum and A. thaliana leaves that the significant alter-
ations to polarization reflection were observed; possibly these infections change the surface
structure in ways which influence vector behaviours after alighting on the leaf.
It is known that leaf surface features affect the behaviour of insects. The structure and chem-
ical composition of the cuticular waxes can affect feeding behaviour and whether a host plant is
recognised as a suitable host [17,46], with aphids determining host suitability by making a
series of short test punctures prior to engaging in sustained phloem ingestion [47]. NPT viruses
would be likely to increase the likelihood of their transmission by causing symptoms which
reduce the likelihood of sustained aphid feeding being initiated [2,3,6]; perhaps by changing
the gustatory or olfactory properties of the waxy cuticle, or thickening the cuticle to make feed-
ing more difficult. The epicuticular waxes also influence the polarizing properties of plants as
they form the outermost layer of the leaf surface, and therefore represent the initial point of
contact between incident light and the leaf. At a given angle of incidence, specular reflectance
is influenced by the refractive index (RI) of a surface [48,49]. The surface wax RI, usually given
as 1.5 for an air-leaf interface [50], could be affected by the composition of the wax layer [21]
and therefore altered expression of wax synthesis genes during viral infection could lead to
changes in the percentage polarization of reflected light.
Analysis of CER gene transcript levels suggested that PVY and CMV can affect expression
of these genes in a contrasting way to TMV and PepMV. In N. tabacum, CER6 showed a trend
towards increased expression levels in PVY and CMV-infected leaves and reduced levels in
TMV and PepMV-infected leaves. CER6 also showed an increased abundance in CMV-
infected A. thaliana leaves, albeit with reasonably high variance. CER6 encodes a condensing
enzyme, which extends VLCFAs greater than 24 carbons in length [35], so there may be a shift
towards longer chain lengths or increased wax deposition on leaves infected with PVY/CMV in
comparison to healthy or TMV/PepMV-infected leaves.
The only CER gene showing any trend towards notably increased abundance in leaves
infected with a non-insect-vectored virus was the CER9 gene in TVCV-infected A. thaliana
leaves. CER9 is a negative regulator of leaf wax synthesis [40], so when taken together with the
absence of any increases in expression of the other CER genes, it appears that this non-insect-
vectored virus may have inhibitory effects on cuticular wax synthesis relative to the impacts of
the aphid-vectored viruses, where several examples of trends towards CER gene upregulation
were observed across both host plants.
The experiments presented here were performed using N. tabacum and A. thaliana as viral
hosts, both of which produce smooth, rather than crystalline, epicuticular waxes on the leaves.
Any impact of altered wax gene expression on polarization reflection could be more pro-
nounced on host plants with crystalline wax layers, as these structures are determined by the

 wax composition [51], meaning the surface roughness (and thereby polarization reflection)
could be altered significantly through changes to the formation of epicuticular wax crystals.
Another feature of the leaf surface which could affect polarization reflection and vector
behaviour is the trichome. A densely pubescent leaf will have a low percentage polarization
reflection [19] and could interfere with insect movement [18], potentially causing aphids to
abandon the leaf sooner than they would on a more glabrous leaf surface. Although there was
not found to be any significant impacts of TVCV or CMV on trichome densities on A. thaliana
leaves, it remains a possibility that viral infection may affect trichome numbers in other host
plants, including N. tabacum. The absence of significant impacts of infection on leaf hair den-
sity in A. thaliana suggests that changes to the cuticular waxes may be primarily responsible
for the altered polarization reflection, although general distortion to the leaf surface on a larger
scale also has an effect on the percentage polarization reflection.
The observed impacts of the aphid-vectored viruses on polarization reflection in N. tabacum
may therefore be a consequence of adaptive changes to the leaf surface structure induced by
the viruses to influence vector behaviours after alighting on the leaf surface. It is also possible
that the changes to polarization reflection influence host plant selection by vectors through
visual detection of the variations in polarized reflectance between healthy and infected plants,
changing their behaviour before they alight on a plant’s surface. Our observation in N. tabacum
that aphid-vectored viruses can affect the percentage polarization reflection in a different way
to non-insect-vectored viruses indicates that these effects are associated with transmission and
are therefore likely to be adaptive, as the transmission stage is a major bottleneck in the viral
lifecycle [52,53] and as such must be subject to very strong selection pressures. This suggestion
is further supported by the fact that it is on the abaxial surfaces of the leaf that these effects are
most strongly pronounced, as viral vectors such as aphids preferentially colonise and feed on
the abaxial side of the leaf [47]. The abaxial surface seems the more likely to be used as a visual
cue for apterous (wingless) aphids, which move between plants if host quality declines [54] and
can spread viruses between closely spaced plants [55]; however, alate (winged) aphids, which
can spread viruses over larger distances, would view leaves from a variety of angles, so the char-
acteristics of both the adaxial and abaxial surfaces may influence the behaviour of alates.
The results of this study tentatively support the hypothesis that plant viruses affect the fea-
tures of leaf surfaces in ways that are associated with the viral transmission strategy, specifically
by altering the polarization of reflected light from the plant leaves reflect. Key areas to address
in future investigations will be to determine whether aphid-vectored viruses also alter the
chemical and/or physical properties of the leaf cuticle and whether this could impact aphid
behaviour in ways which influence viral transmission, either through direct effects of the sur-
face phenotype, or through remote cues mediated by the polarization of light. It would also be
necessary to establish whether aphid-vectored and non-insect-vectored viruses differ in their
impacts on polarization reflection in a variety of host plants, and to analyse in greater depth
the impact of infection on the expression of the many genes known to regulate the formation
of leaf surface structures. Finally, work specific to the polarization vision of aphids and the
saliency to these animals of polarization reflections by plants is needed.
Methods
Polarization imaging
Images were acquired using a Nikon D70 SLR camera mounted on a tripod, with a linearly
polarizing filter attached in front of the lens. An LED torch with diffusing material attached
was used to provide depolarized illumination. Leaves were detached from plants and placed on
a bench, in order to minimise movement whilst acquiring images, and the light source and

 camera were positioned at 55◦ from vertical, on opposite sides of the midline of the leaf, to
obtain images with light reflecting from the leaf around Brewster’s angle. A series of seven
images was taken per leaf, with the polarizing filter being rotated in 20° increments between
each image, followed by a final “dark” image with the lens cap attached. Images were obtained
in “raw” NEF format and converted to TIFF files using the open source software DCRAW. The
relative brightness recorded at each pixel (after subtraction of the “dark” image) at various
angles of polarizing filter orientation can be used to calculate the percentage polarization, and
this was carried out using two custom written MATLAB programs. Data obtained in the blue
channel, and the average of the two green channels (with peak sensitivities at 480nm and
540nm respectively) [56], were used for subsequent analysis. The average percentage polariza-
tion across a leaf was calculated from each image, using ImageJ to select all of the pixels in one
half of the leaf lateral to the mid-vein. These values were then exported to MATLAB for analy-
sis. When performing imaging experiments in A. thaliana, leaves were overlaid with card and a
localised region of 0.5cm2 was imaged through a window cut in the card.
Viruses
PVY° and a European isolate of PepMV were obtained from the Food and Environment
Research Agency, York, UK. CMV Fny and TVCV were kindly provided by Dr John Carr, Uni-
versity of Cambridge.
Amplification of ECERIFERUM genes
Sequences in the NCBI N. tabacum EST database with high homology to characterised A. thali-
ana mRNA sequences were used to design primers for amplification of CER5 and CER6 from
N. tabacum. A degenerate primer approach was used to isolate the N. tabacum CER3 sequence.
The sequence data were subsequently deposited in the NCBI database (accession numbers
KT279573, KT279574, KT279575). Primers are outlined in Table 1 (N. tabacum) and Table 2
(A. thaliana).
RNA was extracted from N. tabacum leaves at 7DPI and A. thaliana rosette leaves at 14DPI,
using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen). For qPCR experiments, leaf material from five separate plants
within each treatment was pooled prior to performing the RNA extraction. DNase I (Fermen-
tas) was used to remove genomic DNA contamination and the first strand cDNA synthesis kit
(Fermentas) was used to reverse transcribe the extracted RNA. DreamTaq green DNA poly-
merase (Fermentas) was used to amplify expressed target gene sequences from the first stand
cDNA. Amplified sequences were cloned in E. coli using the pJET1.2/blunt vector (Fermentas).

 The plasmids were then extracted using the Qiaprep spin miniprep kit (Qiagen) and sequenced
(GATC biotech) using the pJET1.2/blunt sequencing primers (Fermentas). BLAST searches
were used to verify the identity of the amplified sequences.
Quantitative PCR
qPCR experiments were performed using Maxima SYBR green (Fermentas). In each host, two
reference genes were used for normalisation of expression levels; ELONGATION FACTOR 1α
and PROTODERMAL FACTOR 2 in N. tabacum, and SAND and F-BOX in A. thaliana. First
stand cDNA was prepared as described above. Primer dissociation curves were used to confirm
the specificity of primer pairs to their intended targets, and three or four biological repeats
(each comprising independently inoculated groups of plants) were included in all experiments.
Results obtained using both reference genes were averaged across all biological repeats, and
analysed using the comparative ΔΔCt method [57]. One sample t-tests were used for statistical
comparisons between the infected and healthy treatments. Primers are outlined in Table 1 (N.
tabacum) and Table 2 (A. thaliana).
Plant inoculation and growth
N. tabacum were germinated on Leavington F2 compost and grown for 5–6 weeks under long
day conditions (16:8 hours light:dark) prior to inoculation. A. thaliana seeds were germinated
on Lehle medium at 20°C under short day conditions (8:16 hours light:dark) and grown for 14
days, prior to transfer to soil (Leavington F2 compost with added sand), for a further 14 days
before inoculation.
N. tabacum SR1 and the Colombia-0 ecotype of A. thaliana were mechanically inoculated
with viruses. Infected material was ground in deionised water and the resulting sap was manu-
ally rubbed onto the upper surfaces of leaves using carborundum powder as an abrasive. The
inoculum was washed from the leaf after two minutes. Healthy control plants were mock-inoc-
ulated using sterile deionised water. Expanding leaves close to the apex were inoculated on N.
tabacum and upper leaves in the rosette were inoculated on A. thaliana. Following inoculation,

 plants were maintained at 20°C, under long day conditions in the case of N. tabacum, and
short day conditions for A. thaliana.
Trichome counts
Rosette leaves were detached from plants at 21DPI and placed between two microscope slides.
The leaves were imaged using a Nikon D700 DSLR-CMOS sensor camera mounted on a Nikon
SMZ-2T stereomicroscope. The “Volocity Demo” software was used to count the total number
of hairs visible on each leaf surface, and ImageJ was used to calculate leaf surface areas for tri-
chome density calculations.
Statistical analysis
All statistical analyses were carried out using SPSS statistics (IBM). In the polarization imaging
analysis, independent samples t-tests, or Mann Whitney tests where data did not meet require-
ments for parametric statistics, were used to test the significance of differences between healthy
and infected leaves. The Benjamini-Hochberg correction (using a false discovery rate of 0.05)
was used to account for the use of multiple statistical tests.
