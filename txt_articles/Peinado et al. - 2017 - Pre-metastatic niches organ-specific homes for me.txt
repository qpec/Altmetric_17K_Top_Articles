 A pivotal discovery by Stephen Paget in 1889 (REF. 1) pos-
tulated that metastasis is dependent on the interactions 
between ‘seeds’ (or the cancer cells) and the ‘soil’ (or the 
host microenvironment). Paget’s theory was challenged in 
the 1930s by James Ewing, who advocated that metastatic 
dissemination could be explained solely by the dynam-
ics of haematogenous flow2 (FIG. 1). Ewing’s perspective 
became the prevalent viewpoint until Isaiah Fidler’s 
research in the 1970s demonstrated that, although the 
mechanical properties of blood flow were important, 
successful metastatic colonization could occur only at 
certain organ sites3,4. In addition to strengthening Paget’s 
theory, Fidler’s findings reignited interest in the question 
that first captivated Paget3,5: why do tumour cells emerge 
only as disseminated tumour cells (DTCs) within specific 
organs? Is metastatic seeding monoclonal or polyclonal 
in nature? Moreover, does metastatic seeding occur only 
directly from the primary tumour or is secondary seeding 
from one metastatic organ to another also a biologically 
relevant event? This organ specificity observed in metas-
tasis is known as organotropism and remains one of the 
most intriguing unanswered questions in cancer research.
Additional fundamental discoveries revealed that 
tumours induce the formation of microenvironments 
in distant organs that are conducive to the survival 
and outgrowth of tumour cells before their arrival at 
these sites6–9. These predetermined microenvironments 
are termed ‘pre-metastatic niches’ (PMNs)7 (FIGS 1,2). 
Since the existence of the PMN was first demonstrated, 
numerous studies have identified various molecules 
that regulate its stepwise evolution, highlighting the 
complex molecular and cellular changes that occur 
in the PMN to support future metastatic tumour 
growth6,10,11 (FIG. 2). PMNs are the result of the combined 
systemic effects of tumour-secreted factors and tumour-
shed extracellular vesicles (EVs) that promote a tempo-
ral sequence of events during the evolution of PMNs. 
Vascular leakiness is the earliest event in this sequence, 
followed by the alteration of local resident cells, such as 
fibroblasts, and the recruitment of non-resident cells, 
such as bone marrow-derived cells (BMDCs), to these 
PMNs, subsequently attracting circulating tumour cells 
(CTCs)6,7,12. Although congruent with both Paget’s and 
Ewing’s theories, the concept of the PMN is unique 
as it proposes that the primary tumour preconditions 
specific organ sites for future metastatic disease (that 
is, before CTC arrival) via tumour-derived factors. 
Therefore, in contrast to the metastatic niche, which 
is initiated and shaped upon CTC arrival, the PMN 
 
represents an abnormal, tumour growth-favouring 
microenvironment devoid of cancer cells.
In addition to the contribution of tumour-secreted 
factors to PMN formation, there are other tumour- 
independent pathological and physiological processes 
involved, such as the effects of surgery, infection and 
ageing (that is, the ageing bone marrow), which alter 
the local milieu and help to create a microenvironment 
that is sufficiently receptive to colonization by CTCs13–
15. It has become clear that extracellular matrix (ECM) 
remodelling is crucial for establishing the PMN (FIG. 2). 
Moreover, PMNs are probable sites of immune dereg-
ulation, owing to the presence of a pro-tumorigenic,

Abstract | It is well established that organs of future metastasis are not passive receivers of 
circulating tumour cells, but are instead selectively and actively modified by the primary 
tumour before metastatic spread has even occurred. Sowing the ‘seeds’ of metastasis requires 
the action of tumour-secreted factors and tumour-shed extracellular vesicles that enable the 
‘soil’ at distant metastatic sites to encourage the outgrowth of incoming cancer cells. In this 
Review, we summarize the main processes and new mechanisms involved in the formation of 
the pre-metastatic niche.

population of membrane- 
surrounded structures released 
by cells into the intercellular 
space and the circulation. Their 
sizes range from 30 
nm to 5 
μm 
in diameter and they include 
exosomes (typically 
30–150 
nm), microvesicles 
(150–1,000

bodies (1–5 
μm).
Vascular leakiness

resulting in increased 
permeability of vessels to 
macromolecules and cells that 
normally face resistance or do 
not cross endothelial barriers.
Circulating tumour cells
(CTCs). Rare cells shed by solid 
tumours into the systemic 
circulation at an estimated 
frequency of 1:500,000–
1:1,000,000 circulating cells.

organs that supports the 
survival and outgrowth of

inflammatory milieu induced by tumour-secreted 
 
factors, which creates immunosuppression and 
 
coagulation disorders6,10,16 (FIG. 2).
In this Review, we summarize the progression of 
PMN formation. We discuss the main mechanisms 
involved in PMN generation and their impact on 
host cells in pre-metastatic organs. We also discuss a 
novel concept: the generation of specialized micro-
environments, named ‘sleepy niches’
, where tumour cells 
could survive in a dormant state (BOX 1).
Setting the clinical stage
Most of the work exploring tumour-directed PMN for-
mation has used orthotopic and transgenic mouse models 
of metastasis, and most of our understanding of PMN 
biology is based on studies of lung metastasis, one of 
the most frequent sites of metastasis in both preclinical 
models and patients17,18. Preclinical models of metastasis 
enable researchers to test therapies in laboratory condi-
tions that mimic disease present in patients. Nonetheless, 
there are several challenges associated with setting up 
spontaneous metastasis experiments such as the limited 
availability of syngeneic mouse models and the fact that 
metastasis is not confined to one metastatic organ18.
Currently, technical limitations, such as the lack of 
specific probes to track PMNs in real time by positron 
emission tomography (PET) and nuclear magnetic 
resonance (NMR) or the difficulty of obtaining pre- 
metastatic tissues from patients, remain the biggest 
obstacles in clarifying the clinical importance of PMNs 
for future metastasis. However, this gap in knowledge is 
now being addressed by several groups. These include 
a large cohort study assessing PMNs and metastatic 
niches in omental tissues from patients undergoing surgi-
cal resection of primary ovarian carcinomas (F. Balkwill, 
personal communication), as well as studies in pre- 
metastatic livers from patients undergoing surgical 
resection of primary pancreatic tumours (D.L. and W
. R. 
Jarnagin, unpublished data).
Improving the understanding of PMN biology in 
patients requires the development of new technolo-
gies for better imaging techniques, such as the devel-
opment of imaging probes to differentiate PMNs from 
healthy tissue. Thus, efforts to further uncover the clin-
ical relevance and other ramifications of these niches 
are on 
going. For instance, much research is needed to 
explore the possibility of persisting PMNs that coexist 
once metastatic niches are created in a specific organ 
site and to determine whether established metastatic 
 
niches (or metastases on their own) can modulate 
secondary PMNs at additional organ sites of future 
 
metastasis (FIG. 1).
Organ-specific PMNs
Increasing clinical evidence reveals the existence of 
PMNs in tissue samples derived from cancer patients, as 
observed in sentinel lymph nodes (LNs) resected from 
patients with colorectal, prostate, breast, thyroid, blad-
der, gastric and renal cell carcinomas8. LN PMNs were 
identified in mouse models of experimental metastasis 
and in patients with breast cancer, showing that pro- 
vasculogenic vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1 
(VEGFR1)+ myeloid progenitor cells colonize LNs primed 
by tumour-secreted factors before the arrival of CTCs19. 
Subsequently, it was demonstrated that lymphangiogenesis 
precedes CTC arrival at future sites of LN metastasis20,21. 
Tumour cells encounter immune cells within LNs and the 
lung and interact with them directly or indirectly through 
tumour-secreted factors or EVs22,23. These interactions 
likely modulate immune responses against CTCs24.
Liver PMN formation, which occurs during the ini-
tial phases of visceral metastasis (that is, meta 
stasis of 
gastrointestinal tract cancers, breast cancer and mela-
noma), also relies on BMDC recruitment25–27. Enzymes 
involved in ECM remodelling, such as tissue inhibitor 
of metallo 
peptidase 1 (TIMP1), generate liver PMNs 
through stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF1; also 
known as CXCL12)–C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 
(CXCR4)-dependent recruitment of neutrophils28. More 
recently, exosomes were demonstrated to be biomarkers 
and functional contributors to liver PMNs29. Specifically, 
exosomes derived from human pancreatic cancer cell 
lines expressing macrophage migration inhibitory factor 
(MIF) ‘educated’ Kupffer cells to produce transforming 
growth factor-β (TGFβ), which promoted ECM remodel-
ling by hepatic stellate cells, enabling recruitment of bone 
 
marrow-derived macrophages. Thus, exosomal MIF 
levels may serve as an early biomarker for liver PMN

formation. Another exosomal biomarker, glypican 1, may 
also function in liver PMN formation, as well as being an 
indicator of early pancreatic cancer30. Thus, the mecha-
nisms of PMN formation at sites of visceral metastasis 
share common features, such as BMDC influx and the 
horizontal transfer of information via tumour-secreted 
factors and exosomes.
Bone is a common site of metastasis for many types of 
solid tumour31. Primary tumours and the circulating fac-
tors derived from them can condition target cells residing 
in the bone to support PMNs and metastatic cell colo-
nization14,32,33. The reciprocal crosstalk between tumour 
cells and bone cells creates an environment ripe for osteo-
blastic (that is, bone-forming) or osteolytic (that is, bone- 
degrading) metastases. In osteolytic metastases (for 
example, from breast cancers), hypoxic tumour-secreted 
factors, such as the ECM-modifying enzyme lysyl oxi-
dase (LOX), are essential for the formation of PMN 
osteolytic lesions33 (discussed further below). Other 
secreted factors such as parathyroid hormone-related 
protein (PTHrP)34, interleukin-6 (IL-6)34–37 and matrix 
metalloproteinases (MMPs)38–40 are known to activate 
osteoblasts, releasing high levels of receptor activator 
of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) ligand (RANKL), which 
in turn induces osteoclast differentiation. These factors 
in turn promote the survival, growth and continued 
pro-osteolytic signalling of cancer cells14,41. In osteo-
blastic metastases (for example, from prostate cancers) 
there is still scarce information regarding PMN forma-
tion. Primary tumour-secreted factors such as WNT, 
Figure 1 | Factors involved in PMN formation. a | Tumour-secreted factors and extracellular vesicles (EVs) shed by the 
primary tumour (blue arrows) induce pre-metastatic niche (PMN) formation in target organs before metastatic cell 
seeding occurs. Tumour cells seeding (pink arrows) the PMN thrive and give rise to micrometastasis. Cells seeding 
non-PMN areas lack a supportive tissue microenvironment and fail metastatic colonization. Specific niches — known as 
dormant niches — have contrasting effects to PMNs on circulating tumour cells (CTCs), promoting tumour cell dormancy 
instead of metastatic outgrowth. Molecules such as thrombospondin 1 (TSP1), deposited around stable microvasculature 
in response to bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) and transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ) secreted by stromal cells, are 
crucial mediators of cancer cell quiescence and thus dormancy. Dormant niches may arise in specific metastatic organs 
that constitute a growth-suppressive microenvironment for disseminated tumour cells (DTCs) (see also BOX 1). b | In most 
types of solid cancer, a primary tumour has the ability to seed more than one organ. Tumour-secreted factors and EVs can 
promote PMN formation in different organs, modulating the fate of tumour cell seeding at each metastatic site. 
Organ-specific seeding has also been observed and extensively reported in the literature. Most often, organ-specific 
metastasis is the result of metastatic colonization by a specific tumour subclone. Metastatic dissemination can be 
achieved via the haematogenous or lymphatic system. Interestingly, some cancer types, such as sarcomas, preferentially 
spread through blood vessels200,201, whereas others, such as epithelium-derived cancers, spread via the lymphatic 
vessels200,201. c | Distinct PMNs form in different organs as a result of seeding by specific subclones derived from the primary 
tumour or owing to distinct microenvironments present at secondary sites of metastasis. Organ-specific PMNs may 
promote the formation of polyclonal metastatic lesions, composed of different tumour cell subclones, as opposed to the 
‘traditional’ view that metastatic lesions are monoclonal in origin.

A (VEGFA) influence osteoblast activity directly or indi-
rectly42–45 and therefore may be candidates for driving 
osteoblastic PMNs. Whether these factors could execute 
these changes distally is still a matter of study.
Last but not least, the brain, as an immuno-
privileged site protected by the unique properties of 
the blood–brain barrier (BBB), remains a challenge, as 
brain metastasis is one of the deadliest complications 
of treatment failure46. Several recent studies have pro-
vided considerable insight into the evolution of BBB 
vascular permeability during cancer metastasis and its 
consequences for therapeutic efficacy46–49. For exam-
ple, reduction in expression of the astrocytic basement 
membrane component laminin-α2 and the CD13+ 
pericyte subpopulation are observed when BBB per-
meability is compromised47. Although the brain PMN 
remains mostly uncharted territory, glucose metabo-
lism is one of the most relevant mechanisms involved 
in breast cancer metastasis to the brain50 as will be 
 
discussed further below.

 Micrometastasis
The formation of a microscopic 
metastasis, usually defined as 
a cluster of 10–12 cells in 
mouse models of metastasis.
Secreted factors in PMN formation
The establishment of PMNs facilitates organotropic 
metastasis by promoting CTC survival and outgrowth. 
This was shown first by injecting a Lewis lung carci-
noma (LLC) cell line, which metastasizes only within 
the lung, into the flank of syngeneic mice pretreated with 
 
melanoma-conditioned medium (MCM). In MCM-
treated mice, LLC cells now metastasized to spleen, 
kidney, oviduct and intestine, which are organs asso-
ciated with melanoma metastasis7. This demonstrated 
that tumour-derived factors were a crucial component 
of MCM, and it was later shown that tumour-secreted 
exosomes exert crucial effects on PMN establishment 
(FIGS 1,2). Indeed, tumour-derived exosomes dictate 
organotropic behaviour51, raising the question of what 
characteristics distinguish PMNs established in each of 
these organs. These studies reinforce the importance 
 
of the PMN in metastasis development by showing that 
tumour cell-intrinsic metastatic propensities are not suf-
ficient for metastatic seeding and outgrowth and that a 
preconditioned microenvironment is the key determinant 
of organ-specific metastasis (TABLE 1).
The pro-metastatic secretome
Pro-angiogenic factors, such as VEGFA and pla-
centa growth factor (PLGF)7, as well as inflammatory 
cytokines and chemokines, such as TGFβ and tumour 
necrosis factor (TNF), released by melanoma (B16 cells) 
and lung cancer (LLC cells) primary tumour cells were 
the first molecules shown to support PMN formation 
in the lung52,53 (TABLE 1). Furthermore, of the factors 
 
supporting BMDC recruitment to future PMNs, 
tumour-secreted granulocyte colony-stimulating factor 
(G-CSF) is sufficient to mimic the pre-metastatic lung 
microenvironment initiated by primary tumours and to 
enhance metastatic properties in both metastatic and 
non-metastatic mouse syngeneic tumours54.
Another tumour-derived chemokine with a crucial 
role in PMN lung formation is chemokine C-C motif 
ligand 2 (CCL2). CCL2 is a potent chemoattractant for 
monocytes, macrophages, memory T lymphocytes and 
natural killer (NK) cells55. The important functions of 
CCL2 in cancer progression are reflected by the corre-
lation between its overexpression and poor prognosis 
in many types of primary tumour55–60. Primary breast 
tumour cell-derived and stromal cell-derived CCL2 can 
also modulate the earliest steps of metastatic colonization 
following PMN formation by recruiting inflammatory 
monocytes that facilitate CTC extravasation in a VEGFA-
dependent manner, thus effectively promoting lung 
micrometastasis61. CCL2 also inhibits NK cell maturation 
in the lung PMN in experimental models of both breast 
cancer and melanoma, probably decreasing the ability 
of NK cells to eliminate incoming CTCs62. Moreover, in 
MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell xenograft models, CCL2 
 
promoted breast cancer metastasis to lung by recruit-
ment of mature macro 
phages to promote invasion and 
early establishment of tumour cell clusters, and to bone 
by enhancing osteo 
clast differentiation and enhancing 
the ‘vicious’ cycle of bone metastasis63,64. By contrast, 
 
in the 4T1 syngeneic model of breast cancer, CCL2 induced 
 
neutrophil-mediated cytotoxicity in the pre- 
metastatic lung via elevated G-CSF levels, therefore inhib-
iting tumour cell seeding in PMNs, as evidenced by the 
reduction in number, but not size, of metastatic foci65. 
Collectively, these findings suggest multifaceted roles of 
CCL2 in PMN evolution and the establishment of early 
metastatic niches.
A common denominator of inflammatory responses 
within PMNs is the S100 family of proteins66. S100 pro-
teins are inflammatory mediators that are crucial in 
intercellular crosstalk between tumour cells and stromal 
cells during PMN formation67. One important char-
acteristic of these proteins is that they act both intra-
cellularly and extracellularly. Within cells, S100 proteins 
regulate proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, Ca2+ 
homeostasis, migration and invasion through interac-
tions with cytoskeletal proteins, enzymes, transcription 
factors and nucleic acids68. Extracellular S100 proteins 
Figure 2 | Model of PMN formation. a | Establishment of the pre-metastatic niche 
(PMN). Clot formation and vascular disruption are hallmarks of the initial step of PMN 
formation. Tumour-secreted factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor A 
(VEGFA) and angiopoietin-like 4 (ANGPTL4) enhance the permeability of microvessels in 
the lung, resulting in loss of vascular integrity and enhanced metastasis. The mechanisms 
underlying such alterations are usually associated with disruption of endothelial cell–cell 
contacts through focal adhesion kinase (FAK) activation. Additionally, local increase in 
cytokines such as chemokine C-C motif ligand 2 (CCL2), of both tumour and stromal 
origin, correlates with the recruitment of various bone marrow-derived cell (BMDC) 
populations, which aid cancer cell extravasation and further contribute to PMN 
formation. Clotting factor production by platelets and accumulation of platelets in 
pre-metastatic organs, through deposition of proteins such as tissue factor (TF), promote 
the initiation of coagulation and clot formation. Clots lead to reduced shear stress and 
reduced interstitial flow, thereby providing docking sites for the arrest of  
circulating tumour cells (CTCs) and are a source of inflammatory signals108,112. In parallel, 
tumour-secreted factors influence the bone marrow niche, where BMDC populations 
become activated and primed for their future recruitment to the PMNs. Extracellular 
vesicles (EVs) have recently been suggested as having a crucial role in the establishment 
of PMNs. b | Evolution of the PMN. During PMN formation, extracellular matrix (ECM) is 
actively deposited and remodelled. Accumulation of fibronectin (FN) and crosslinking of 
collagen I (via lysyl oxidase (LOX)) provide a platform for the adhesion of BMDCs. Distant 
and local secretion of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), which also contributes to the 
early vascular disruption steps, promotes ECM degradation and aids future CTC invasion. 
Adhesion molecules present on tumour-derived exosomes, such as integrins, can bind to 
ECM molecules in organ-specific PMN niches, thereby determining organotropic 
metastasis. Transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ)-dependent production of proteins such 
as periostin, also has an important role in the establishment of the PMN by sustaining the 
future infiltration of metastasis-initiating cells via WNT signalling. Upregulation of S100 
proteins (particularly S100A8 and S100A9) generates inflammation and leads to the 
subsequent recruitment of haematopoietic progenitor cells as well as differentiated 
innate and adaptive immune cells (monocytes, macrophages and myeloid-derived 
suppressor cells (MDSCs), T cells, T regulatory cells and natural killer (NK) cells). 
c | Metastatic niche formation. The established metastatic niche is the combined result of 
BMDC recruitment, underlying ECM changes and inflammation. For instance, changes in 
vascular ECM composition or in the expression of endothelial molecules, such as 
E-selectin enrichment on the luminal surface of endothelium, facilitate CTC adhesion to 
the endothelium, extravasation and metastatic outgrowth. In addition, survival and 
proliferation of cancer cells in the metastatic niche also occur as a consequence of PMN 
evolution, which results from the complex action of various tumour-secreted factors and 
EVs on future tumour-seeding organs. ANGPT2, angiopoietin 2; CCL2, C-C motif ligand

 have both autocrine and paracrine effects via activation 
of cell surface receptors, G-protein-coupled receptors, 
scavenger receptors, heparan sulfate proteoglycans and 
N-glycans67,68. They are involved in processes such as 
enhancement of Ca2+ influx in cells, cytokine produc-
tion, immune cell recruitment and infiltration as well as 
inflammation68. Tumour-secreted factors, such as TNF, 
TGFβ and VEGFA, induce S100A8 and S100A9 expres-
sion by endothelial cells and by CD11b+ myeloid cells 
in the pre-metastatic lungs52,53,69. During this process, in 
mouse models, S100 proteins promote the expression 
and secretion of serum amyloid A3 (SAA3), which in 
turn recruits myeloid cells and tumour cells to PMNs53. 
This process requires SAA3-mediated activation of 
Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and NF-κB signalling53. 
Interestingly, as demonstrated in preclinical models of 
breast cancer, activation of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 
(HIF1) is crucial even in PMN formation70,71. Indeed, 
the HIF1 target LOX is one of the main proteins induced 
at PMNs33,72,73. HIF1α-mediated hypoxia responses 
within the primary tumour may reinforce the secretion 
of both protein factors and EVs that are important in 
PMN formation and metastatic potential74. For exam-
ple, in breast cancer cell lines, EV shedding is increased 
by the HIF-dependent expression of the small GTPase 
RAB22A75. It remains to be determined whether hypoxia 
or HIF signalling alters tumour-derived vesicle cargo 
 
and subsequently the education of stromal cells in 
distant PMNs.
Tumour-derived messengers: EVs
EVs are classified on the basis of their size and origin 
as microvesicles (>150 nm), which are formed at the cell 
surface through a budding mechanism, and exosomes 
(30–150 nm), which are produced in the endolysosomal 
and multivesicular body compartments for release out-
side the cell76,77. The machineries involved in the release of 
EVs, their docking and fusion during both physio 
logical 
and pathological processes are still being deciphered. EV 
movement within the cell requires the cytoskeleton (actin 
and microtubules), associated molecular motors (kine-
sins and myosins), molecular switches (small GTPases) 
and the fusion machinery (SNAREs and tethering fac-
tors)77,78. Metastatic tumour cells demonstrate increased 
ability to package and secrete cargo (that is, proteins and 
microRNAs (mi 
RNAs)) in exosomes29,79,80. Similarly, 
some stimuli that act during PMN formation, such as 
hypoxia, promote the release of exosomes74. Technical 
limitations in analysing PMNs (that is, requirement for 
in vivo microscopy) have hindered the analysis of EV 
dynamics within PMNs. Tumour-derived EVs can be iso-
lated from bodily fluids such as plasma and carry tumour 
cell-derived proteins and genetic material that promote 
disease progression77,81.
Tumour cell-derived EVs fuse with resident cells 
in both PMNs and tumours, transferring their cargo, 
including genetic material (DNA, mRNA and miRNA), 
metabolites (lipids and small metabolites) and pro-
teins79,82–86. Pioneering studies demonstrated that plate-
let-derived EVs (particularly microparticles) induced 
angiogenesis and metastasis in lung and breast can-
cers87,88; however, the relevance of EVs in PMN forma-
tion was not evaluated in these studies. Since then, EVs 
have been shown to contribute to the recruitment and 
transfer of material to other stromal cell types, including 
those populating PMNs81,89–91.
Tumour-derived exosomal miRNA and pro-
teins reprogramme or educate target cells that take 
up exosomes towards a pro-metastatic and pro- 
inflammatory phenotype, creating the PMN29,79. 
Education of stromal cells depends on the cancer type 
and pre-metastatic organ analysed. In melanoma, 
the hepatocyte growth factor receptor, MET, which 
is secreted in B16-F10 melanoma-derived exosomes, 
reinforces the expression of tyrosine kinase with 
Box 1 | The ‘sleepy niche’: tumour cell dormancy
The biology of certain tumours demonstrates that, instead of forming pre-metastatic 
niches (PMNs) that increase the efficiency of metastasis, specialized microenvironments 
in which tumour cells could survive in a dormant state may occur. One could consider 
these niches as silent PMNs, which could result in extensive delay to the development 
of metastasis, as occurs in some patients. Defining the biology of both active and silent 
PMNs could help in understanding the different processes of metastasis. The enduring 
message of Paget’s 1889 publication in the Lancet1 is his now famous ‘seed and soil’ 
hypothesis, which explains why breast cancer cells exhibit a proclivity for metastasizing 
to certain organ sites. Largely ignored was the contemporary view of Julius Cohnheim, 
of whom Paget said: “…[he was] of [the] opinion that a healthy organ has a certain 
ability to resist the growth of such an embolus; and he speaks of ‘diminished resistance’ 
as Fuchs speaks of ‘predisposition’.” (REF. 5). How do healthy tissues resist the 
outgrowth of disseminated tumour cells (DTCs)?
DTCs persist long term essentially in a single-cell state within organs that succumb to 
metastasis as well as in other organs that rarely do190–192. The cellular and molecular 
constituents of the niches that promote DTC dormancy are now being elucidated. Two 
themes have emerged. The first is that niche-based cues function only in the context of 
specific tissues175. Factors that induce and sustain dormancy of DTCs from breast 
cancer, prostate cancer and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma act exclusively in 
lung (for example, bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4)193) or in bone marrow (BMP7 
and transforming growth factor-β2 (TGFβ2)194,195) despite their presence in other tissues, 
suggesting that they act in concert with additional factors. Whereas thrombospondin 1 
(TSP1; also known as THBS1) suppresses DTC outgrowth in both lung and bone 
marrow196, neither TSP1, BMP4, BMP7 nor TGFβ2 affect DTC dormancy in brain196. 
Indeed, a mediator of DTC dormancy specific to brain — or one that induces 
quiescence systemically — has yet to be uncovered.
The second major theme is that maintenance of tissue homeostasis is crucial. Most 
dormant breast cancer DTCs associate with the abluminal surface of the microvasculature 
of distant organ sites196. Using organotypic models of microvasculature,  
stable endothelium was shown to drive DTC quiescence, and perivascular TSP1 was a 
major endothelium-derived suppressor of DTC outgrowth196. But, how are these 
suppressive cues overcome? When microvascular homeostasis is disrupted, not only do 
sprouting vessels fail to express appreciable levels of TSP1, but endothelial tip cells 
deposit many of the factors found in PMNs — fibronectin, TGFβ1, periostin, tenascin C, 
versican and S100 proteins196. Whereas endothelial quiescence can be disrupted by any 
number of processes (for example, inflammation, wounding and ageing), it is also likely 
that primary tumour-derived factors released into the circulation affect the perivascular 
niche197,198. Although the primary tumour can be removed by surgical resection and 
patients can typically experience metastatic relapse after decades, it is important to 
realize that tumour cells can disseminate very early during tumour progression199. 
Therefore, dissemination, induction of DTC quiescence and disruption of these controls 
may have already occurred by the time the primary tumour is detected; a nuance that is 
not considered in the clinical definition of dormancy, which is a clinically asymptomatic 
state in which residual DTCs remain at undetectable levels for 5–7 years after seemingly 
successful treatment of the primary tumour. Primary tumour-derived factors may be the 
source of this dormancy disruption, destroying the dormant niche and inducing a PMN by 
altering microvascular homeostasis of specific tissues. If true, this would essentially marry 
and validate both Paget’s and Cohnheim’s theories.

(EGF) homology domains 2 (TIE2) and MET in blood- 
circulating BMDCs, and promotes pro-vasculogenic 
and pro-migratory properties in these cells. These re- 
educated BMDCs then exit the bone marrow and con-
tribute to the formation of PMNs in lungs79. Importantly, 
exosomes secreted by B16-F10 melanoma cells promote 
vascular leakiness in lung PMNs, inducing a pro-in-
flammatory response by increasing the expression of 
cytokines and chemokines such as TNF, S100A8 and 
S100A9, which, in turn, recruit BMDCs to these PMNs79. 
However, the source of S100 proteins was not defined 
in this study. Breast and pancreatic cancer cell-secreted 
exosomes express integrins on their surface, which 
promotes their homing to PMNs51. Expression of the 
integrin α6β4 hetero 
dimer on the surface of tumour- 
derived exosomes promotes their homing to lung PMNs, 
whereas αvβ5 targets them to liver PMNs. The homing

 Cancer stem cells
A subset of cancer cells that 
share features of normal stem 
cells, such as self-renewal and 
differentiation and that can 
regenerate the tumour.
of exosomes to these organs caused an increase in pro- 
inflammatory S100 family proteins in the PMN, 
 
generating a supportive microenvironment for sub-
sequent metastasis51. Interestingly, human renal cancer 
stem cells promote angiogenesis and the formation of 
PMNs in the lungs, which involves CD105+ micro-
vesicles inducing the expression of pro-angiogenic 
mRNAs and mi 
RNAs in the whole organ92.
LN PMNs can be induced by intra-footpad injection 
of B16-F10 melanoma-derived exosomes93. In this study, 
genes associated with angiogenesis and ECM modifica-
tion were highly upregulated in LNs; however, the cell 
types involved in the secretion of these factors were not 
identified. CD44 variant isoform (CD44v) secreted by 
pancreatic cancer cells enables the formation of specific 
microenvironments that favour the homing of tumour- 
secreted exosomes, inducing PMN formation in lung and 
LN22. Regarding liver PMNs, pancreatic tumour-derived 
exosomes expressing MIF promote TGFβ secretion in 
Kupffer cells, stimulating hepatic stellate cells to secrete 
fibronectin and promoting the recruitment of BMDCs29.
Interestingly, genomic content (that is, mi 
RNAs) is also 
packaged selectively within EVs and is involved in PMN 
formation50,82,84,94. Tumour-derived microvesicles can 
suppress glucose uptake by stromal cells in brain PMNs 
through the transfer of miR-122 and inhibition of pyru-
vate kinase. This increases glucose availability in PMNs, 
attracting tumour cells, thus favouring brain metastasis50. 
Recently, RNAs packaged within primary tumour-derived 
exosomes were found to be involved in the activation of 
TLR3-dependent signalling in lung epithelial cells, induc-
ing chemokine secretion in the lung and promoting PMN 
formation by recruiting neutrophils95.
These findings are only the beginning of our under-
standing of how tumour-derived EVs are involved in 
metastasis. There are many outstanding issues await-
ing further research. First, it is imperative to determine 
which subpopulation of tumour cells gives rise to EVs 
that induce PMN formation. Second, a full characteri-
zation of secreted vesicles and their associated cargo is 
needed to understand how metabolic alterations affect 
PMN formation. Third, how long does EV-mediated 
education of recipient cells last? Can EV-mediated 
education be reverted? Can educated cells be further 
 
re-educated by exposure to new EV content? And, are 
these cells more or less sensitive to repeated EV exposure? 
Lastly, much emphasis is now placed on understand-
ing how EVs form, adhere, fuse and educate recipient 
 
cells within PMNs, which is crucial to dissecting EV 
involvement at all stages of PMN formation.
The establishment of PMNs
The stepwise progression of PMN formation is initiated 
with local changes such as the induction of vascular 
 
leakiness, remodelling of stroma and ECM, followed 
by dramatic systemic effects on the immune system96,97 
(FIG. 2).
Local changes in the PMN
Vessel barrier breakdown: sites of vascular leakiness 
and beyond. The vasculature at PMNs is remodelled by 
primary tumour-secreted factors through various mech-
anisms. Animal tumour models show increased vascu-
lar permeability at PMNs98,99, which is associated with 
enhanced metastatic burden79,98,100,101. Altered vascular 
integrity is manifested through hyperpermeability, aber-
rant morphology of vascular endothelium and breakdown 
of the vascular basement membrane in the pre-metastatic 
lungs of mouse models of melanoma98 and breast can-
cer101. Secreted factors, such as the EGF receptor (EGFR) 
ligand epiregulin, cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2; also known 
as PTGS2), MMP1 and MMP2, can induce vascular per-
meability in primary breast tumours and distant organs, 
enabling CTCs to extravasate102. Genetic ablation of these 
secreted factors in breast cancer cells impaired their ability 
to metastasize when injected through the tail vein. These 
data suggest that secretion of these factors from primary 
tumours may also be involved in the disruption of vascu-
lar permeability at PMNs. Furthermore, TGFβ induces 
the expression of angiopoietin like 4 (ANGPTL4) in breast 
tumour cells, including CTCs, enhancing the permeabil-
ity of microvessels in the lung103. In a melanoma model, 
primary tumour-secreted factors upregulated angio-
poietin 2 (ANGPT2), MMP3 and MMP10 in the pre- 
metastatic lung, which synergistically destabilized blood 
vessels98. The specific identities of the cells expressing 
these molecules and the tumour-secreted factors that 
induce their expression have yet to be defined. Another 
member of the MMP family, MMP9, is intimately 
involved in regulating vascular integrity in PMNs7,52. 
Myeloid progenitor cells recruited to the pre-metastatic 
lung produce high levels of MMP9, leading to ECM 
remodelling and formation of a proliferative, immuno-
suppressive and inflamed PMN in the lung101. Genetic 
ablation of Mmp9 normalized the aberrant vasculature 
in the pre-metastatic lung, resulting in diminished lung 
metastasis and improvement of host immune surveil-
lance101. These results suggest that MMPs expressed by 
tissue-resident cells at sites of PMN formation act in 
concert to destabilize the vasculature and create a PMN.
An active role for altered endothelial cells within 
the hyperpermeable area of PMNs has also been pro-
posed98,100. Syngeneic breast and lung primary tumours 
induce the formation of discrete foci within hyper-
permeable vessels in the pre-metastatic lung. These foci 
were defined by E-selectin enrichment on the luminal 
surface of endothelium, which in turn facilitated CTC 
adhesion and outgrowth100. E-selectin upregulation is 
mediated by VEGFA-dependent induction of endothelial 
focal adhesion kinase (FAK)100 secreted by tumour cells 
or by injection of recombinant VEGFA, and inhibition of 
endothelial cell FAK hinders lung metastasis104.
In breast cancer models, CCL2 secretion by tumour 
cells and the stroma leads to the recruitment of monocytes 
expressing C-C chemokine receptor type 2 (CCR2), that, 
in turn, secrete VEGFA61. Monocyte-specific depletion of 
VEGFA significantly inhibited breast cancer experimental 
metastasis potential and seeding efficiency61. Therefore, 
secreted factors could act synchronously by increas-
ing both endothelial leakiness and the recruitment of 
BMDCs, which then promote PMN formation and hence 
metastatic colonization and outgrowth61,105.

 Fenestrated vasculature
A permeable type of 
vasculature that contains 
ultramicroscopic pores of 
variable sizes, usually found in 
kidneys and glands as well as 
in the circumventricular organs 
of the brain.
Venous thromboembolism
(VTE). Refers to either of two 
blood clot-related conditions: 
deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or 
pulmonary embolism (PE). DVT 
occurs when a blood clot forms 
in a deep vein whereas a PE 
occurs when a blood clot 
breaks off and circulates to the 
lung.
Disseminated intravascular 
coagulation
Systemic activation of blood 
coagulation, leading to fibrin 
accumulation, which in turn 
results in the formation of 
microvascular thrombi in vital 
organs.
T helper 1 (TH1) cell
Member of a subset of CD4+ 
T cells that can activate 
macrophages and mediate 
cellular immunity through 
secretion of interferon-γ (IFNγ), 
interleukin-2 (IL-2) and tumour 
necrosis factor-α (TNFα).
It is likely that metastatic organotropism requires spe-
cific interactions of tumour cells with endothelial cells in 
those organs102,106. Although these observations were not 
made in the context of PMN biology, transmigration of 
the BBB by cancer cells requires proteolytic processing 
 
of the junctional adhesion molecule B (JAMB; also 
known as JAM2) by cysteine cathepsin S107. By contrast, 
meta 
stasis to organs with more fenestrated vasculature, 
such as the lung, liver or bone marrow, could depend 
almost exclusively on adaptation of tumour cells to spe-
cific microenvironments, as the microvasculature at 
these organ sites is comparatively permissive for tumour 
cell extravasation31,38.
A notable PMN-associated change at the vascular 
level is the formation of blood clots. Even though aber-
rant haemostasis has been associated with cancer pro-
gression and metastasis for more than a century108 and 
venous thromboembolism (VTE) is one of the leading 
causes of mortality in cancer patients109, the biological rel-
evance of clots for cancer progression and the underlying 
mechanisms that regulate it are still largely un 
explored. 
Intravascular fibrin clots that are rich in platelets sur-
round metastatic tumour cells arrested in the vascula-
ture, thus promoting tumour cell dissemination110. Tissue 
factor (TF)-mediated clot formation in lungs recruits 
populations of macrophages expressing CD11b, CD68, 
F4/80 and CX3C chemo 
kine receptor 1 (CX3CR1) dur-
ing PMN formation, thus enhancing CTC homing and 
survival111. Interestingly, platelets are required for the 
rapid recruitment of CD11b+MMP9+Ly6G+ granulocytes 
to tumour cells to form lung ‘early metastatic niches’
. This 
mechanism involves C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 5 
(CXCL5) and CXCL7 secretion by platelets upon con-
tact with different types of tumour cell (that is, breast 
cancer cells in a spontaneous mouse model of breast 
cancer), promoting tumour cell seeding and metastatic 
progression in the lungs112. Cancer complications such 
as disseminated intravascular coagulation, in which throm-
bosis and haemorrhage occur simultaneously, could then 
reinforce the secretion of factors that promote tumour 
 
metastasis. Further characterization of both processes 
in the context of PMN biology, as well as determining 
whether tumour-secreted and platelet-secreted EVs 
 
have a role in cancer-associated coagulopathies, may lead 
 
to the development of therapies that can reduce 
 
patient mortality.
Awakening the stromal residents. Perturbation of 
endothelial cell function is just one of the first alterations 
during PMN development, as other stromal cell types 
are activated by secreted factors from primary tumours 
and contribute to PMN establishment (FIG. 2). Fibroblasts 
remodel ECM at PMNs either by depositing new ECM 
components or by secreting enzymes that alter the exist-
ing ECM structure32 (discussed further below). S100A4+ 
pulmonary fibroblasts are the main cell type incorporat-
ing exosomes derived from MDA-MB-4175 lung-tropic 
breast cancer cells51. Importantly, exosomal cargo induces 
the upregulation of specific S100 family members in stro-
mal cells, depending on the tumour type51. Specifically, 
in vitro treatment of lung fibroblasts with exosomes 
derived from breast cancer cell lines up 
regulates S100A4, 
S100A6, S100A10, S100A11, S100A13 and S100A16, 
whereas the analogous treatment of Kupffer cells with 
exosomes derived from pancreatic cancer cell lines 
resulted in upregulation of S100P and S100A8 (REF. 51). 
Moreover, S100A8 and S100A9 are strongly induced 
in the lungs 24 hours after intravenous injection of 
exosomes derived from the highly malignant B16-F10 
melanoma cell line79. Mice injected sub 
cutaneously with 
LLC and 3LL lung cancer cell lines, then treated with 
monoclonal antibodies against S100A8 and S100A9, 
displayed fewer CD11b+ myeloid cells in pre-metastatic 
lungs and dramatically reduced lung metastasis53. The 
induction of SAA1 and SAA3 by breast cancer-derived 
S100A4 or by intravenous injection of S100A4 resulted 
in the expression of pro-inflammatory molecules such as 
S100A8, S100A9, G-CSF and MMPs in an organ-specific 
manner113. In addition, SAA1 and SAA3 upregulation by 
S100A4 increased tumour cell adhesion to fibronectin 
(discussed further below) and BMDC recruitment to 
metastatic organs67. These observations suggest that 
S100A4 acts through mechanisms similar to S100A8 and 
S100A9 to regulate the formation of PMNs by promot-
ing pro-inflammatory microenvironments both in the 
 
primary tumour and in PMNs114.
Additional stromal cells activated during PMN for-
mation are tissue-resident macrophages. Indeed, liver 
Kupffer cells, upon stimulation by exosomes derived 
from pancreatic cancer cell lines carrying MIF, can 
induce fibronectin production by hepatic stellate cells 
and generate a fibrotic liver environment, which facili-
tates the recruitment of BMDCs to PMNs and thus PMN 
formation64. Pulmonary alveolar macrophages also par-
ticipate in the lung PMN in a mouse model of breast 
cancer115. Tumour-preconditioned alveolar macrophages 
contribute to immunosuppression by inhibiting tumo-
ricidal T helper 1 (TH1) cell function as well as reducing 
the number and hindering the maturation of tumour 
antigen-presenting dendritic cells in the pre-metastatic 
lung, thus supporting metastasis.
Remodelling the ECM. The ECM at pre-metastatic 
organ sites undergoes remarkable changes in response to 
systemic factors released from the primary tumour, acti-
vated stromal cells or recruited BMDCs15 (FIG. 2). Such 
changes can be achieved by two mechanisms, deposi-
tion of new ECM components and changing the physical 
properties of pre-existing ECM at PMNs.
Fibronectin deposition by activated stromal fibro-
blasts in the pre-metastatic lung or liver has been 
observed in mouse models of melanoma and pancre-
atic cancer, respectively7,64. Accumulation of fibro-
nectin provides a permissive niche for the adhesion 
of BMDCs, which are crucial components of PMNs. 
In addition, tumour-derived factors, such as TGFβ, 
induce the expression and secretion of periostin from 
stromal fibroblasts expressing α-smooth muscle actin 
(αSMA; also known as ACTA2) and vimentin (VIM) 
in the pre-metastatic lung of the MMTV-PyMT mouse 
model of breast cancer116. Secretion and incorporation 
of periostin into ECM thus establishes a PMN that

 Metastasis-initiating cells
Rare tumour cells that have the 
capacity to survive and 
proliferate in distant metastatic 
sites.
Myeloid-derived suppressor 
cells
(MDSCs). A heterogeneous 
population of myeloid-derived 
immunosuppresive and 
pro-tumorigenic cells that 
suppress T cell function. They 
expand in number in 
pathological conditions and 
interact with other innate and 
adaptive immune cells to 
modulate their function. They 
universally express CD11b, but 
can be further categorized in 
both mice and humans on the 
basis of expression of 
additional markers into 
granulocytic and monocytic 
lineages.
Macrometastases
The outgrowth of 
micrometastases that are 
histologically or radiologically 
detectable.
sustains infiltrating metastasis-initiating cells by augment-
ing WNT signalling. First, periostin interacts with ECM 
molecules intracellularly and then it is deposited outside 
the cell117. So far, periostin has been described to inter-
act with type I collagen, fibronectin, NOTCH1, tenas-
cin C and BMP1. Through these interactions periostin 
engages integrins such as αvβ3 and αvβ5 and promotes 
cell motility by acting outside the cell117. In a mouse 
wound-healing model, periostin was up 
regulated 
in damaged tissue, forming a PMN-like micro-
environment and promoting melanoma cell metastasis 
 
to wound sites118. More recently, periostin was 
 
found to be essential for the immunosuppresive func-
tion of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) in the 
pre-metastatic lung during breast cancer metastasis119.
Versican is an ECM proteoglycan with multifaceted 
roles in the PMN. In mouse models of LLC lung can-
cer injected via the tail vein, tumour-derived versican 
activated macrophages through TLR2 to generate an 
inflammatory microenvironment in the pre-metastatic 
lung105. By contrast, in MMTV-PyMT mice, the sources 
of versican are CD11b+Ly6Chi myeloid cells recruited 
to the pre-metastatic lung120. Knock-down of versican 
in BMDCs impaired lung metastasis in the MMTV-
PyMT model, underscoring the functional requirement 
for stroma-derived versican in PMN development120.
Enzymatic modulation of ECM structure at the PMN 
can affect vascular integrity (as discussed above) and gen-
erate biologically active ECM fragments72,121–124. Indeed, 
chemoattractant collagen IV peptides released by MMP2 
activity in the pre-metastatic lung guide the homing of 
BMDCs and CTCs to PMNs and promote metastasis72. 
The major sources of these MMPs are BMDCs (for exam-
ple, macrophages, CD11b+ myeloid cells and VEGFR1+ 
haematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs)), stromal 
 
fibroblasts and endothelial cells7,52,72,125,126.
Another important class of ECM-shaping enzymes is 
the LOX family, which catalyses the crosslinking of ECM 
molecules; collagen is their primary substrate. Several 
studies have shown that collagen type I and type IV 
crosslinking by various members of the LOX family 
(including LOX, LOX-like 2 (LOXL2) and LOXL4) 
that accumulate in PMNs of various organs provides 
a platform for adhesion of CD11b+ BMDCs72,70,127. 
Recruitment of CD11b+ BMDCs subsequently contrib-
utes to PMN formation through a positive feedback loop 
of MMP secretion by CD11b+ cells and further invasion 
and recruitment of BMDCs and CTCs owing to the ele-
vated MMP activity72. Hypoxia, through HIF1 activity, is 
a crucial regulator of LOX expression in primary breast 
tumours72. In addition to tumour cells, activated fibro-
blasts have also been identified as a source of LOX72,70,32. 
However, to what extent collagen crosslinking by LOX 
is required for PMN formation in other types of cancer 
remains to be investigated.
It is noteworthy that one important consequence of 
ECM remodelling is the change in physical properties. 
Tension generated in the extracellular micro 
environment 
can initiate a cascade of signal transduction events that act 
as a molecular switch in development, tissue homeostasis 
and disease progression, including metastasis128–132. For 
example, collagen crosslinking also results in increased 
tissue stiffness, which has been shown to directly sup-
port tumour cell seeding, survival and proliferation in 
vitro, and to enhance metastatic outgrowth in vivo32. 
Whether ECM remodelling at PMNs occurs through 
mechanical tension transduction and what the specific 
functional consequences of ECM remodelling at the 
PMN are, remain to be elucidated. Importantly, new 
approaches to studying PMN composition and function, 
 
such as in vivo implantation of ECM-coated poly 
(ε-caprolactone) (PCL) scaffolds that mimic the ECM 
composition of the PMN133, will clarify the contribution of 
the ECM to PMN formation and evolution. Another cru-
cial issue awaiting clarification is whether functionally dis-
tinct variants of ECM molecules resulting from alternative 
splicing (for example, fibronectin has at least 20 variants in 
 
humans134) fulfil distinct roles in ECM remodelling 
 
during PMN establishment, and if so, towards what 
 
functional outcome.
Systemic changes: immune cell recruitment
A hallmark of PMN initiation and evolution is the 
recruitment of BMDCs (FIG. 2). Indeed, the recruitment 
of HPCs expressing VEGFR1 and VLA4 (integrin α4β1) 
to pre-metastatic organs fosters a supportive microen-
vironment for incoming CTCs7. Abrogation of these 
HPC clusters within pre-metastatic organs by either 
VEGFR1 antibody-mediated blockade or depletion of 
VEGFR1+ BMDCs reduced metastasis, indicating the 
essential role of these HPCs during PMN initiation7. 
However, even though upregulation of inhibitor of 
differentiation 1 (ID1) gene expression is crucial for 
VEGFR1+ HPC mobilization during PMN formation135, 
the identities of the tumour-derived factors that induce 
ID1 expression and drive HPC mobilization have yet to 
be determined.
In addition to recruiting HPCs from the bone mar-
row, primary tumours also ‘hijack’ different types 
of immune cell, causing their abnormal differenti-
ation and accumulation at PMNs. Notably, MDSCs 
impose immunosuppression at PMNs and promote 
meta 
stasis28,64,101,136,137. MDSCs can either be recruited 
to PMNs or they may develop from tissue-resident 
 
myeloid populations. An ingenious intravital two- 
photon live imaging approach revealed that upon arrival 
in the lung, CTCs interact with distinct populations 
of resident phagocytes, and tumour cell cytoplasts are 
generated within the lung vasculature that are taken 
up by recruited BMDCs24. Next, tumour-ingesting 
myeloid cells collectively accumulate in the lung inter-
stitium and promote the development of metastases24. 
MDSCs repress interferon-γ (IFNγ)-mediated immune 
responses while inducing the expression of pro-inflam-
matory cytokines, interleukins and SDF1 (REF. 101), 
further supporting the idea that generation of a pro- 
inflammatory, immunosuppressive PMN through 
recruitment of BMDCs is crucial for successful metastatic 
progression. Importantly, PMN-associated MDSCs also 
produce MMP9, a crucial regulator of ECM remodel-
ling and the angiogenic switch that will later support the 
 
formation of micrometastases and macrometastases138,139.

Leukotrienes
Products of the eicosanoid

The roles of neutrophils at PMNs are particularly 
intriguing. Neutrophils can be expanded, mobilized 
and recruited to PMNs via tumour cell-derived G-CSF, 
exosomes or via stromal cell-derived SDF1 in metastatic 
organs28,65,136,137. To date, the markers used to define 
neutrophils are oversimplified and thus identify a het-
erogeneous population marked by profound functional 
complexity. Further immunophenotyping is required to 
sort PMN-infiltrating immune cells for functional assess-
ment. Nevertheless, recent data demonstrate that neutro-
phil recruitment to PMNs and their diminished cytotoxic 
activity both occur only in the absence of type I interferon, 
suggesting that interferon-based therapies could be bene-
ficial in hindering PMN progression140. However, owing 
to the multifaceted role of IFNγ, the tumour-suppressive 
and tumour-promoting activities of which are normally 
dependent on the cellular, microenvironmental and/or 
molecular context, targeting it could be a double-edged 
sword and should be considered carefully141.
Neutrophils were shown to support the establish-
ment of lung PMNs in mouse models of breast can-
cer142. Isolation of neutrophils derived from PMNs 
demonstrated that they secrete leukotrienes, con-
verting heterogeneous cancer cell populations into 
meta 
stasis-initiating cells and enhancing metastatic 
competence142. Recently, lung epithelial cells have been 
described to initiate neutrophil recruitment and lung 
PMNs by sensing tumour exosomal RNAs through 
TLR3 (REF. 95). LLC-derived exosomal RNAs activate 
TLR3 in lung epithelial cells, inducing secretion of 
chemokines (CXCL1, CXCL2, CXCL5 and CXCL12) 
and promoting neutrophil recruitment. An interesting 
question stemming from these observations is: how do 
innate immune cells support PMN formation? Recent 
evidence supports the idea that, besides neutrophils, 
there could be active, EV-mediated communication 
between tumour cells and other innate immune cells 
during PMN formation143.
Clinical implications of PMN
Metastasis is the leading cause of cancer-associated 
death, yet its treatment has limited lasting success49. 
Thus, developing strategies to prevent metastasis, or to 
detect it at its earliest stages, is a priority for improv-
ing patient outcomes. Intriguing questions to consider 
are: can the PMN be manipulated to prevent seeding 
or outgrowth of incoming CTCs? Can non-metastatic 
tumours, their EVs or secreted factors exert systemic 
inhibitory effects on tissues to block metastasis?
PMN detection
Currently, patients with a newly diagnosed malignancy 
are routinely assessed for metastases by radiological 
imaging (for example, computerized tomography (CT) 
and positron emission tomography (PET)), by histol-
ogy and cytology (for example, sentinel LN biopsies 
and bone marrow examination). Both PET and CT 
imaging144 are unreliable in detecting tumours less 
than 1 cm in size145, by which time the tumour cell bur-
den is estimated at 109 cells146. Furthermore, PET–CT 
is frequently unable to differentiate between benign 
inflammatory and malignant lesions. And for practical 
reasons, neither routine use of biopsies nor assessment 
of all potential sites of metastasis is feasible147.
So how can the reliability of metastasis detection be 
improved? Much effort is now being invested in develop-
ing higher resolution imaging techniques and uncovering 
genetic and biochemical biomarkers of early metastasis. 
As such, imaging approaches that can enable detection 
of structural changes in the PMN, such as tissue den-
sity32,33, hold promise. Moreover, biochemical and cel-
lular biomarkers of early metastasis in circulation, such 
as VEGFR1 expression by circulating BMDCs19,96,148–151 
or CD68+ myeloid cells that have activated signal trans-
ducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3)152 have 
great potential as molecular tools for PMN detection 
and monitoring19,96,148–152. Importantly, sphingosine 
 
1-phosphate receptor 1 (S1PR1)–STAT3 signalling acti-
vation in CD68+ myeloid cells is crucial for their recruit-
ment to PMNs and future metastatic outgrowth153–155. 
Selective blocking of VEGFR1 using a novel peptide 
antagonist named iVR1 completely ablated liver PMN 
formation and liver metastasis of colorectal cancer cells in 
mice156. In addition to VEGFR1, other molecules, such as 
dickkopf 1 (DKK1), VEGFA, VEGFD and HIF1α could 
serve as PMN biomarkers in human LNs, predicting 
future metastasis in cancer patients157–159. Importantly, 
morphological and structural changes, such as fibro-
nectin deposition and changes in collagen metabolism, 
occur in LN PMNs, resulting in changes in capsule 
thickness that could be used as a measurement of PMN 
development160. A fibrosis-like environment may precede 
tumour seeding and metastasis at PMNs in the liver29, 
supporting the need to image structural changes in tissue 
density possibly by biopsy of the liver PMN. Most impor-
tantly, clinical trials are ongoing to measure PMN forma-
tion, its diagnostic and prognostic power and whether 
blockade of PMN formation could be obtained by using, 
for example, pazopanib161, a multitargeted tyrosine kinase 
inhibitor against VEGFR1–3, platelet-derived growth 
factor receptor-α (PDGFRA), PDGFRB and KIT162.
EVs may be the most promising biomarkers for assess-
ing risk of tumour progression and metastasis. Their 
accessibility, abundance and stability in the circulation 
make them ideal biomarker candidates. Developing tech-
niques to enrich for tumour-derived EVs to define their 
selective cargo can improve the sensitivity of detection of 
tumour EV-associated biomarkers in blood from cancer 
patients163,164. Alternatively, owing to the technological 
limitations (including obtaining fresh specimens and 
limited viability of tumour-derived explants) of detect-
ing tumour-secreted factors that are involved in PMN 
formation, tumour organoids could be used to iden-
tify tumour-specific biomarkers that can be verified in 
patient plasma. Exosomal miR-105 derived from primary 
tumours from patients with breast cancer (the tumour 
cells of which expressed high levels of miR-105) could 
be detected in patient serum at an early stage before the 
clinical detection of metastasis165. Furthermore, exosomal 
levels of a melanoma-specific protein, tyrosinase-related 
protein 2 (TYRP2; also known as DCT), correlated with 
metastatic progression in a retrospective cohort of patients

with stage III melanoma (patients with LN metastasis) 
at the time the samples were taken, demonstrating that 
plasma exosomes can predict metastasis in melanoma79.
Proof-of-principle studies have demonstrated that 
loading of exosomes with superparamagnetic iron oxide 
nanoparticles or iodine isotopes enables sensitive mag-
netic resonance or radiographic tracking166. Ingenious 
approaches to noninvasive imaging of PMN formation 
in vivo, based on the role of VLA4 in PMN biology, com-
bined the use of PET–CT with [64Cu]CBTE2A-LLP2A 
(a VLA4-targeted PET radio 
pharmaceutical)167,168 or 
relied on label-free quantitative detection methods of 
tumour-derived exosomes through surface plasmon 
resonance imaging169.
If exosome-mediated reprogramming of systemic 
energy metabolism can facilitate disease progression, 
similar exosome-based strategies could be devised to 
hinder PMN formation. For example, exosomes can be 
engineered to deliver molecules that inhibit the repres-
sion of glucose uptake by stromal cells in brain PMNs. 
Therefore, there is hope for translating these advances 
to the clinic to exploit tumour exosomes as predictors of 
metastatic potential and organotropism, as well as ther-
apeutic targets to block PMN formation and metastatic 
colonization.
Preventing PMN formation and progression
Targeted therapies directed against the establishment of 
PMNs could potentially stop metastasis in its tracks. For 
example, ATP release by breast cancer activates the P2Y 
purinoceptor 2 (P2RY2) and subsequently the HIF1–LOX 
axis, which induces collagen crosslinking and the recruit-
ment of CD11b+ BMDCs; inhibition of P2RY2 signalling 
proved an efficient strategy to prevent PMN formation 
in preclinical breast cancer models170. Similarly, down-
stream targeting of LOX by treatment with β-amino-
propionitrile (βAPN), function-blocking antibodies or 
LOX-specific RNA interference showed promise in abol-
ishing PMN formation in preclinical models of breast 
cancer33,72. In another approach, expression of protein 
tyrosine phosphatase receptor-type O (PTPRO, a mul-
ti-target negative regulator of VEGFA, PDGF and FGF 
receptor 1 (FGFR1)) in the mouse breast cancer cell line 
Py81119 prevented PMN formation in preclinical models 
of breast cancer, thus thwarting lung metastasis171. The 
CXCR4 inhibitor AMD3465 also obstructed myeloid cell 
recruitment to liver and lung PMNs, preventing meta-
static progression in immunocompetent mouse mod-
els of breast cancer172. MET inhibition (either through 
small-molecule inhibitors or through humanized anti-
body blockade, both of which are approved by the US 
Food and Drug Administration (FDA)), could represent 
a two-pronged approach that would prevent the func-
tion of pro-metastatic melanoma exosomes as well as the 
recruitment of exosome-educated BMDCs to PMNs79. 
Importantly, substantial breakthroughs in understanding 
the biology of PMN formation, combined with advances 
in imaging and serum biomarker detection, could offer 
opportunities for timely targeting of PMNs and early 
metastasis as well as identifying patients who are likely 
to have aggressive disease.
Future directions
We have achieved tremendous progress in our understand-
ing of the complex molecular mechanisms that govern 
PMN formation, but key questions remain unanswered.
Can PMN progression be hindered?
The redirection of experimental metastasis suggests that 
preconditioning of the microenvironment in specific 
organs, especially via exosomes, can increase their sus-
ceptibility to metastasis51. Therefore, an understanding of 
tumour exosome biogenesis, with the aim of selectively 
controlling tumour exosome production may prove a 
viable approach to reducing metastasis. Conversely, a 
better grasp on the biology of certain tumour-secreted 
factors with anti-metastatic functions may offer unique 
thera 
peutic opportunities. Can inhibitors of angiogenesis, 
such as angiostatin and endostatin173, be used to condition 
PMNs and thereby inhibit metastasis by normalizing the 
vasculature? Furthermore, are there microenvironments 
at sites of future metastasis that either do not require 
preconditioning by tumour-derived factors to support 
meta 
stasis or are intrinsically inhibitory to metastatic 
outgrowth and thus capable of inducing dormancy 
of DTCs174,175?
Are all PMNs created equal?
Is PMN composition in different organs alike? Are 
PMNs in distinct organs induced by the same mech-
anisms? Moreover, what are the dynamics of PMN 
formation? Are PMNs in different organs created 
simultaneously or sequentially? Our observations 
 
suggest that the systemic conditioning of PMNs by 
various cancer types may differ29,51,79. Certain mech-
anisms, such as increased vascular permeability and 
recruitment of BMDCs, seem to be common for all 
tissues examined thus far, but specific molecules 
expressed and/or shed by the tumour (for example, 
chemokine receptors and integrins) could contribute to 
 
organotropic behaviour.
Are there other components of the PMN?
The PMN is a complex microenvironment, and 
less-explored resident and recruited cell types may 
fulfil crucial roles in PMN initiation and progression. 
For example, adipocytes contribute to meta 
stasis by 
secreting adipokines and other cytokines (for exam-
ple, leptin, adiponectin, osteopontin, TNF, IL-6, CCL5 
and CCL2 (REFS 176–178)) and fatty acids to fuel 
rapid tumour growth at metastatic sites179, but their 
contribution to PMN formation remains unknown. 
Accumulating evidence indicates that activated 
sympathetic neurons can also induce a metastatic 
switch in mouse breast and ovarian cancer models 
by increasing tumour vascularization and invasion 
in the metastatic microenvironment via neuroendo-
crine signalling180. Sympathetic neuron signalling can 
also alter the cytokine profile of the bone microenvi-
ronment, which can induce osteolysis and promote 
the colonization of metastatic breast cancer cells 
in bones180, adding neurons to the tumour–stroma 
 
crosstalk within the PMN.

 Can PMNs be biomarkers of metastasis?
Early detection of PMNs before radiographic evidence 
of metastasis remains a challenge. New technologies that 
attempt to detect hyperpermeable regions, hypoxic and 
inflammatory areas, ECM alterations or BMDC recruit-
ment at pre-metastatic stages are being developed166–168,181. 
More sensitive and translational technical approaches, 
such as labelling specific PMN probes (that is, by the 
use of inhibitors, antibodies or peptides recognizing the 
main proteins that are upregulated at PMNs) with radi-
oisotopes, are needed to translate these findings to the 
clinical setting. Moreover, determining which PMN will 
transition to metastatic disease offers additional oppor-
tunities to improve diagnostic, biomarker and prevention 
potential associated with PMN detection.
Why do secondary tumours develop?
Secondary tumours (also known as metastasis) that 
arise after surgery are derived from the primary tumour 
cells. Given the evidence that primary tumours can 
precondition distant sites for metastasis, it is likely that 
such education by tumour-derived factors has already 
occurred and PMNs have already been formed before 
surgical removal of the primary tumour. Nevertheless, 
it is clear that surgery is followed not only by tumour 
cell shedding into the circulation, but also by a surge 
of inflammatory cells in the blood, thus favouring 
PMN formation182. Moreover, surgical intervention has 
been shown to induce local hypoxia and injury, which 
in themselves promote metastasis183–185, but the sys-
temic implications for PMN formation have yet to be 
explored. Further studies will need to address whether 
tumour-secreted factors, such as EVs, are also increased 
after surgery and contribute to PMN development and 
thus support future metastasis, and whether non-steroi-
dal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which reduce 
the most immediate and abundant peak of breast cancer 
recurrence (9–18 months after surgery) fivefold186 could 
function as a prophylactic that acts (at least partially) by 
reversing PMN formation in patients with breast cancer.
Can the PMN be targeted?
Does chemotherapy or radiotherapy promote PMN 
development? Specific targeting of PMN components 
(for example, inhibitors of VLA4, TNF, LOX or HIF) 
reduces metastasis in preclinical models7,33,53,73, but owing 
to current technical limitations in detecting PMNs and 
the lack of clinical trials to test these molecules in the pre- 
metastatic setting in patients, the efficacy of this approach 
in preventing metastasis in cancer patients has yet to be 
determined. One possible explanation for the inadequate 
control of cancer metastasis with current pharmacological 
approaches is the failure of drugs to reach the PMN owing 
to the increased permeability of the vasculature at PMNs 
(as discussed above). Vascular leakiness leads to an abnor-
mal tumour microenvironment characterized by intersti-
tial hypertension (elevated hydrostatic pressure outside 
the blood vessels), hypoxia and acidosis187. Stabilization 
of vasculature at PMNs could then help to improve spe-
cific strategies against PMN formation. Furthermore, the 
systemic consequences of any current or novel therapy 
on PMN formation are difficult to predict. For example, 
mobilization of haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells 
from their niches may alter the bone marrow micro-
environment for malignant cells to engraft188. It is also 
possible that certain treatments may alter organotropism; 
for example, agents activating specific cell types such as 
osteoclasts may promote bone metastasis33.
Summary
In conclusion, remarkable progress in our knowledge 
regarding PMN formation and evolution has been made 
in the past decade since the PMN was first described. We 
envisage the PMN as a new paradigm for the initiation of 
metastasis and recognize that the pathological processes 
occurring before the development of macrometastases 
require better understanding. This is crucial, especially 
as in patients PMNs may not only be established in 
distant organs but may also develop in the vicinity of 
macrometastatic lesions in the same organ. Moreover, 
treatment of macrometastasis (for example, by targeting 
angiogenesis), can promote micrometastasis189 and could 
also promote PMN formation, warranting the identifi-
cation of therapies that could thwart all processes simul-
taneously. The primary tumour-directed induction of 
the PMN enforced by tumour-secreted factors can dic-
tate metastatic burden and distribution, and the cellular 
make-up of future PMNs is an area ripe for exploration. 
The study of PMNs could benefit from 3D modelling of 
organ-specific niches, to enable a systematic dissection 
of the cellular and ECM components of the PMN. The 
challenge that lies ahead, to bring the advances in our 
understanding of PMN biology to the bench, is transla-
tion of this complex biology to diagnostic and treatment 
approaches. This will require innovative, well-designed 
clinical trials with (potentially) alternative end points 
and means to detect PMNs and assess their viability after 
treatment. Given that treatments for metastasis need 
 
to be improved and further developed, the field may 
indeed be ready to take this step.
