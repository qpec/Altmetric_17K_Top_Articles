T
ype 2 diabetes mellitus is a growing pandemic and a lead-
ing cause of morbidity and mortality.1 After the DCCT 
(Diabetes Control and Complications Trial)2 found that tight 
glycemic control–a glycohemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) <7% (53 
mmol/mol)–could prevent or slow the progression of nephropa-
thy, retinopathy, and neuropathy in patients with type 1 diabetes 
mellitus, a consensus, extended to patients with type 1 and type 2 
diabetes mellitus, emerged: normalizing glycemia prevents dia-
betes mellitus complications. Guidelines, quality improvement 
interventions, quality-of-care measures, and patient-directed 
marketing have since focused on achieving tight glycemic con-
trol.3–5 Experts labeled clinicians’ failure to intensify therapy to 
achieve this target as clinical inertia and a quality gap.6–8
As large randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and their 
follow-up extensions accrued, experts have interpreted their 
results as confirming that tight glycemic control prevented 
microvascular complications of type 2 diabetes mellitus, but 
they may only prevent cardiovascular complications and mor-
tality in some patients, perhaps those newly diagnosed with 
this condition.9–14 The body of evidence, previously sum-
marized in meta-analyses of large RCTs, seems to confirm 
this impression (Table I in the Data Supplement).15–25 This 
evidence has contributed to a consensus reflected in univer-
sal guideline recommendations, quality improvement efforts, 
and clinical decisions all promoting tight glycemic control 
(HbA1c <6.5 or 7.0%).26–28 The same evidence, however, has 
led some critics to question this consensus.22,29,30
Given the impact on patients, healthcare delivery, and 
policymaking, the extent to which the consensus about the 
value of tight glycemic control is consistent with the body of 
evidence merits clarification. Accordingly, we sought to sys-
tematically examine the relationship between the body of evi-
dence about glycemic control in type 2 diabetes mellitus and 
the contemporary statements on the value of tight glycemic 
Background—We sought to determine the concordance between the accumulating evidence about the impact of tight versus 
less tight glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus since the publication of UKPDS (UK Prospective 
Diabetes Study) in 1998 until 2015 with the views about that evidence published in journal articles and practice guidelines.
Methods and Results—We searched in top general medicine and specialty journals for articles referring to glycemic 
control appearing between 2006 and 2015 and identified the latest practice guidelines. To summarize the evidence, we 
included all published systematic reviews and meta-analyses of contemporary randomized trials of glycemic control 
measuring patient-important microvascular and macrovascular outcomes, and completed a meta-analysis of their follow-
up extensions. We identified 16 guidelines and 328 statements. The body of evidence produced estimates warranting 
moderate confidence. This evidence reported no significant impact of tight glycemic control on the risk of dialysis/
transplantation/renal death, blindness, or neuropathy. In the past decade, however, most published statements (77%–
100%) and guidelines (95%) unequivocally endorsed benefit. There is also no significant effect on all-cause mortality, 
cardiovascular mortality, or stroke; however, there is a consistent 15% relative-risk reduction of nonfatal myocardial 
infarction. Between 2006 and 2008, most statements (47%–83%) endorsed the benefit; after 2008 (ACCORD), only a 
minority (21%–36%) did.
Conclusions—Discordance exists between the research evidence and academic and clinical policy statements about 
the value of tight glycemic control to reduce micro- and macrovascular complications. This discordance may distort 
priorities in the research and practice agendas designed to improve the lives of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

control, when compared with less tight control (HbA1c 7.0%–
8.5%), with regard to microvascular and macrovascular out-
comes, published in the past decade in top medical journals 
and clinical practice guidelines.
Methods
Identification and Selection of Published Statements 
Referring to Glycemic Control
On the basis of the 2014 Journal Citation Reports,31 we identified 
the 5 general medical journals (New England Journal of Medicine, 
The Lancet, Journal of the American Medical Association [JAMA], 
the BMJ, and Annals of Internal Medicine), and clinical diabetes 
(Diabetes Care) and cardiology (Journal of the American College 
of Cardiology) journals with the highest impact factor within these 
categories.
Using the search engine for each journal’s online site, we 
searched for glycemic control and alternative spellings in original 
articles, reviews, letters, commentaries, and editorials appearing be-
tween January 2006 and March 2015. Eligible articles offered any 
statement about the effect of glycemic control on microvascular or 
macrovascular complications in patients with type 2 diabetes mel-
litus. We included all eligible articles from general medicine jour-
nals, and, because of the large volume of pertinent articles, only those 
published in the first trimester (January to March) of each year for 
the specialty journals. Article selection was reproducible: chance-
adjusted agreement between the 2 reviewers (R.R.-G. and V.M.M.) 
tested in 20% of the sample was κ=0.93; 95% confidence interval, 
0.85 to 1.00.
With the help of an experienced librarian, we developed an en-
vironmental scan strategy using the terms for concepts of diabe-
tes, guidelines, and standards of care, to identify clinical practice 
guidelines about diabetes mellitus without language restriction. 
This was strengthened with a search in the National Guideline 
Clearinghouse. We also consulted Mayo Clinic experts in the 
field to identify guidelines missed by our search strategy. Eligible 
guidelines were the latest version published and included state-
ments about the effect of glycemic control on microvascular and 
macrovascular complications in patients with type 2 diabetes 
mellitus. Because practice standards from the American Diabetes 
Association are issued yearly and we believe them to have a broad 
impact, we included all published in the decade of interest. Chance-
adjusted agreement for guideline selection between reviewers was 
perfect (κ=1.0).
Classification of Statements in Articles and 
Guidelines
We classified the statements in each article and guideline about the 
causal relationship between achieving tight glycemic control and 
the prevention of microvascular and macrovascular complications 
in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus because either clearly fa-
vorable or uncertain/skeptical. For example, we classified as clearly 
favorable for microvascular complications and uncertain for macro-
vascular complications the following statement: data from random-
ized trials indicate early and aggressive antihyperglycemic therapy 
significantly reduces the risk of long-term microvascular outcomes. 
Although the effects of tight glucose control on macrovascular dis-
ease are less clear.32 This classification was reproducible (κ=0.87 
for journal articles, κ=1.0 for guidelines). Within each year—2006 
to 2015—we estimated the proportion of articles with statements 
clearly in favor of tight glycemic control to prevent micro- and mac-
rovascular outcomes.
Body of Evidence About Glycemic Control
The body of large randomized trial evidence about glycemic control 
has been previously summarized, except for the published follow-up 
extensions of these RCTs. Table I in the Data Supplement describes 
contemporary large RCTs, their corresponding follow-up extensions 
and the meta-analyses that include these RCTs. At the individual trial 
level, we excluded trials that did not test contemporary treatment ap-
proaches (eg, Kumamoto),33 tested multifactorial risk factor reduction 
(eg, Steno-2),34 or evaluated specific antihyperglycemic agents (eg, 
PROactive).35 However, some reviews included some or all of these 
studies, and we retained their summaries in our analyses of the body 
of evidence, subject to sensitivity analyses. When necessary data 
were not discernible from published studies, as was the case with 2 
extension studies, we attempted to contact authors without success. 
We did not impute any data.
Because the follow-up extension studies have not been summa-
rized, we conducted a meta-analysis. To this end, we extracted the 
reported hazard or risk ratios and their 95% confidence intervals 
(CIs) from each extension study and conducted a random effects 
(DerSimonian and Laird) meta-analysis on each outcome of inter-
est. Because UKPDS (UK Prospective Diabetes Study) 33 control 
patients also participated as controls in UKPDS 34, we constructed 
2 pooled estimates including either one or the other study. Analyses 
were conducted using the OpenMeta Analyst Software.36
Examined outcomes were those patients experience and consider 
important.37–39 We selected the following microvascular outcomes as 
important to patients: end-stage renal disease (ESRD) or dialysis, 
renal death, blindness, and clinical neuropathy. We also included 
microalbuminuria and retinal photocoagulation because they are of-
ten cited as surrogate outcomes of patient-important microvascular 
complications and are consistently reported in RCTs. We selected 
the following macrovascular outcomes as important to patients: 
all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, nonfatal myocardial 
infarction (MI), fatal and nonfatal stroke, and peripheral vascular 
events or amputations. To rate the confidence (high, moderate, low, 
or very low) in the estimates about the impact of glycemic control 
on each micro- and macrovascular outcomes from this body of evi-
dence,38,40 reviewers worked together using the GRADE (Grading 
of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) 
approach, taking into account the risk of bias (methodological qual-
ity), directness, consistency, precision of estimates, and risk of bi-
ased reporting.
WHAT IS KNOWN
• Tight glycemic control is considered an essential 
strategy to prevent chronic complications in patients 
with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
• Practice 
guideline 
recommendations, 
quality 
improvement programs, and clinical care all promote 
tight glycemic control.
WHAT THE STUDY ADDS
• The evidence accrued in the past 2 decades consis-
tently demonstrates no significant benefit of tight 
glycemic control on patient-important micro- and 
macrovascular outcomes, with the exception of a 
15% relative-risk reduction in nonfatal myocardial 
infarction.
• Despite this, most published statements and all 
guidelines unequivocally endorse tight glycemic 
control to prevent microvascular complications, 
although the benefits for macrovascular outcomes 
have been tempered after one trial was stopped early 
because of increased cardiovascular mortality.
• The widespread consensus about the value of tight 
glycemic control to prevent complications in patients 
with type 2 diabetes mellitus needs to be recalibrated.

Results
Study Identification
We identified 328 journal articles (Table II in the Data Supple-
ment), 16 guidelines (including 10 American Diabetes Asso-
ciation standards from 2006 to 2015, Tables II and III in the 
Data Supplement), 11 meta-analyses published between 2009 
and 2014, and 5 RCTs10–14 and their extension studies41–44 (Fig-
ure IA and IB in the Data Supplement; Tables I, II, and III in 
the Data Supplement).
Reliability of the Body of Evidence About 
Microvascular and Macrovascular Outcomes
Using GRADE, we rated the body of evidence as warranting 
moderate confidence in estimates; it rendered precise (with 
>400 events for most outcomes) and consistent estimates of 
direct applicability at moderate risk of bias (because of lack 
of blinding, loss to follow-up in long-term studies; Tables IX 
through XI in the Data Supplement).45 However, results were 
inconsistent for mortality outcomes; also the evidence was 
sparse for ESRD, renal death, and amputations46 (Table XII in 
the Data Supplement).
Relationship Between Statements in Favor of Tight 
Glycemic Control and the Body of Evidence
Microvascular Complications
Figure 1A shows the relationship between the estimates of 
treatment effect for each of the included studies and con-
temporaneous statements about the value of tight glycemic 
control on microvascular complications (Table V in the Data 
Supplement). Since 1998, evidence warranting moderate con-
fidence reports no significant impact of tight glycemic control 
on the risk of ESRD, renal death, blindness, and clinical neu-
ropathy. The exception was the ADVANCE trial that reported 
a reduction of 65% (95% CI, 17–85) in the risk of ESRD or 
dialysis. These estimates are imprecise (very wide CI): impor-
tant but small benefits, that is, ≤5 fewer ESRD events per 1000 
patients treated with tight glycemic control, are still consistent 
with the data. This imprecision may be because of the lack of 
effect, the enrollment of low-risk patients, or brief duration of 
follow-up.45 Figure 2A also shows a very low (<6%) incidence 
of all microvascular outcomes and no apparent HbA1c thresh-
old effect on microvascular complications. In contrast, prac-
tice guidelines and published statements offer a consistent and 
confident consensus, with 100% of the guidelines and 77% 
to 100% of the statements in favor of tight glycemic control 
to prevent microvascular complications (Figure 1A; Tables II 
and III in the Data Supplement).
Macrovascular Complications
The picture with regard to macrovascular complications is more 
complex. Tight glycemic control reduces the risk of nonfatal 
MI by 15%, a consistent finding across the included studies 
(Figure 1B; Table VI in the Data Supplement), although there is 
no significant effect of tight glycemic control on all-cause and 
cardiovascular mortality. That a reduction in the risk of nonfa-
tal MI is not associated with a concomitant reduction in the risk 
of cardiovascular death complicates its interpretation. In fact, 
the ACCORD study reported significant increases in the risks 
of all-cause mortality (by 26%; 95% CI, 6–51) and of cardio-
vascular mortality (by 43%; 95% CI, 11–86) while reporting a 
significant reduction in the risk of nonfatal MI (by 21%; 95% 
CI, 5–34). These is evidence of no significant effect of tight 
glycemic control on the risk of strokes. The effect on amputa-
tions is imprecise, in part, due to few events. Recent RCTs have 
enrolled lower risk participants, reducing the chance of detect-
ing differences if they exist (Figure 2). Long-term follow-up 
studies that accrued more events, however, could not maintain 
HbA1c <7% in the intervention arm limiting their relevance to 
current guideline targets (Figure 2B; Figure S4).
Before the ACCORD trial, a majority of statements 
declared valuable to achieve tight glycemic control to prevent 
macrovascular complications (47%–59%). Uncertainty clearly 
emerged after the publication of the results of ACCORD in 
200814: only 21% of statements favored tight glycemic control 
in 2009. Although biological reasons, including hypoglyce-
mia (Figure II in the Data Supplement; Table VII in the Data 
Supplement), have been proposed and rejected,14,47,48 chance 
remains an explanation, the estimate likely an exaggeration 
produced by the trialists’ decision to truncate the trial.49,50 
After ACCORD, the consensus about the value of tight glyce-
mic control to prevent macrovascular complications withered, 
with most statements (64%–79%) expressing uncertainty 
and skepticism. Only two of the guidelines examined, the 
American Diabetes Association standards published in 2003 
and in 2004, declared valuable to achieve tight glycemic con-
trol to reduce macrovascular complications.
Discussion
Our Findings
Although no significant impact of tight glycemic control on 
the risks of patient-important nephropathy, retinopathy, or 
neuropathy is evident, most published statements and practice 
guidelines endorse its value to prevent microvascular compli-
cations. It is possible that these statements rely on indirect evi-
dence (ie, on surrogates of these patient-important outcomes, 
such as microalbuminuria), but such reliance should reduce 
their confidence in the value of glycemic control. Although the 
evidence supports similar cautious skepticism about the impact 
of glycemic control on mortality and cardiovascular end points, 
a similarly favorable consensus existed before the ACCORD 
trial (2008). Since then, the prevailing skepticism, while appro-
priate, may have failed to account for the consistent apparent 
benefits of tight glycemic control on the risk of nonfatal MI.
The use of composite end points that include both patient-
important and surrogate outcomes may have contributed to this 
consensus. The UKPDS was a landmark study that reported 
a significant decrease in the risk of the composite any diabe-
tes mellitus–related end point with tight glycemic control,10 
although 85% of the effect was limited to one component: 
retinal photocoagulation. Similarly, ADVANCE investigators 
reported a 14% relative reduction in the risk of a composite 
microvascular outcome, with almost all of the effect limited to 
reductions in the risk of new micro- and macroalbuminuria.9,12 
ADVANCE researchers also reported a 65% reduction in the 
risk of ESRD, but this was based on few end points (20 ver-
sus 7 events), which renders statistical inference fragile.45,51

ACCORD reported benefits such as delayed onset of macro-
albuminuria, of 3-line worsened visual acuity, of loss of ankle 
jerk, and of loss of sensation to light touch, but no significant 
reduction in the risk of patient-important microvascular com-
plications. The VADT also reported reduction in the risk of pro-
gression to albuminuria but no significant impact on important 
microvascular outcomes.13 This pattern persists in meta-analy-
ses of these RCTs and of their extensions (Figure 1A). Thus, 
the consensus favoring glycemic control may narrowly reflect 
evidence of benefit of tight glycemic control on surrogate 
markers of microalbuminuria and retinal photocoagulation.
Limitations and Strengths of Our Analysis
Several concerns may reduce confidence in our analyses. We 
limited our review of journals to those with highest impact

an elite of researchers and clinicians. That these statements 
agree with contemporary guidelines strengthen our sense that 
they represent dominant and influential, rather than fringe, 
views. Our focus on the past decade (2006–2015), while arbi-
trary, offers complete coverage: after the UKPDS; before the 
ACCORD, ADVANCE, and VADT; before and after the pub-
lication of the respective extension reports; and present time. 
As others, we have excluded the Kumamoto (which tested 
the DCCT intervention in patients with type 2 diabetes mel-
litus) and UGDP trials (which was stopped early because of 
harm marred in controversy over its data handling) as indi-
vidual trials, although their data were represented in some of 
the included meta-analyses. In addition, the timeframe of our 
systematic search for meta-analyses of RCTs (2009 to present 
time) offers complete coverage of all major trials: UKPDS, 
ACCORD, ADVANCE, and VADT, the latter published last 
in January 2009.
There is some concerns about placing the UKPDS trial 
alongside the ACCORD, VADT, or ADVANCE trials because 
the population are different in terms of duration of diabetes 
mellitus, glycemic targets, antihyperglycemic agents used, 
comorbidities, and use of statins. Described as supportive of 
early aggressive intervention to reduce macrovascular com-
plications, statements often expressed uncertainty about the 
applicability of the UKPDS results to older patients with 
comorbidities and more advanced disease.48,52 Inspection of 
Figure 2, however, reveals how most results of UKPDS, partic-
ularly of UKPDS 33, are similar to those of more recent RCTs 
for both micro- and macrovascular outcomes. Furthermore, a 
consistent beneficial effect on nonfatal MI is seen across all 
of these trials, even ACCORD. These findings should reduce 
our confidence that the results of the UKPDS trial are different 
to those of latter trials and enable us to consider these trials 
together as forming a body of evidence.
Our focus on outcomes important to patients may have 
artificially introduced uncertainty that perhaps is not as evi-
dent when one focuses on the effect of glycemic control 
on surrogate markers or composite end points (eg, any dia-
betes mellitus–related complications; Figure III in the Data 
Supplement; Table VIII in the Data Supplement). Surrogate 
markers, to be valid, need to capture all of the effect of treat-
ment on the outcomes of interest.53,54 In the ON-TARGET 
trial, for example, dual renin–angiotensin–aldosterone block-
ade prevented albuminuria, but worsened renal outcomes and 
mortality.55 The inconsistencies observed in diabetes trials 
between the effect of glycemic control on surrogates and on 
outcomes important to patients should lower our confidence 
in relying on these surrogates for decision making and support 
the case for larger and longer-term investigations.
Composite end points have been used in all diabetes 
mellitus trials and may have contributed to obfuscate their 
interpretation. The UKPDS used the end point “any diabetes 
mellitus–related end point,” which included 14 components 
and was reduced significantly with glycemic control by 3.2%. 
Almost all of this reduction, 2.7%, was on the retinal pho-
tocoagulation end point, with almost no effect on the other 
components of greater importance to patients, such as mor-
tality, stroke, amputation, blindness, or need for dialysis.10 
Composite end points that exhibit large gradients of treatment 
effects and of importance to patients (death and cataract 
extraction while very different in their importance to patients 
were both included in the same UKPDS end point) cannot be 
interpreted, that is, the statement that glycemic control sig-
nificantly reduced all diabetes mellitus–related complications 
is potentially misleading.56,57 It is plausible that reliance on 
surrogate and composite end points has contributed to the 
observed consensus.
Implications for Policy and Practice
We find the overwhelming consensus in favor of tight glycemic 
control to prevent microvascular complications to be stronger 
than warranted by the evidence. This consensus likely drives 
guidelines and quality-of-care interventions focused on gly-
cemic control. It also supports the US Food and Drug Admin-
istration policy to approve diabetes mellitus drugs only on 
the basis of their antihyperglycemic effect without requiring 
evidence of reduction in the risk of complications. This con-
sensus is also driving studies such as the National Institutes 
of Health–funded GRADE trial comparing antihyperglycemic 
drugs on their ability to reduce HbA1c, rather than to reduce 
the risk of diabetes mellitus complications.58 Given the uncer-
tain relationship between tight glycemic control and outcomes 
that matter to patients, this consensus and its downstream con-
sequences to practice, policy, and research deserve review.
As of 2015, the evidence suggests that a skeptical view 
may be necessary to move diabetes mellitus care forward. 
The notion that tight glycemic control is clearly beneficial 
does not hold in the face of the evidence accrued during the 
past decade, evidence that has fallen short of confirming this 
notion. The contributions of >27 000 patients participating in 
RCTs of glycemic control, their clinicians, and the investi-
gators that designed and conducted these trials, question our 
confident reliance on tight glycemic control as the main or, in 
some cases only, strategy to prevent complications in patients 
with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Perhaps as a result, guideline 
developers are now advocating for selecting less stringent 
HbA1c targets in patients with recurrent severe hypoglyce-
mia, high-comorbidity burden, or limited-life expectancy.52,59
Embracing this skeptical view may spur research to dis-
cover new therapeutic approaches to prevent diabetes mellitus 
complications. Consider the list of evidence-based therapies 
recommended in guidelines, subject of quality metrics, or rou-
tinely prescribed to patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus to 
prevent retinopathy or neuropathy beyond glycemic control: 
none. Beyond interventions to improve vascular health that 
may be helpful,60 our narrow focus on hyperglycemia has kept 
this list empty. In this sense, we could not find in clinicaltri-
als.gov any ongoing trials exploring interventions to prevent 
microvascular complications. In contrast, where we are skep-
tical, there is at least 1 National Institutes of Health program 
announcement calling for RCTs to reduce cardiovascular risk 
in older adults with diabetes mellitus.61
Moderation in expectations about the value of tight glyce-
mic control may help advance the individualization of diabetes 
mellitus care protocols, whispered in recent guidelines,52 using 
shared decision making to select glycemic targets and treat-
ments.62,63 This, however, will require further research to clarify 
the tradeoffs involved when selecting different targets (below

the point of symptomatic hyperglycemia), and when selecting 
glycemic control to reduce the residual risk of complications 
(eg, nonfatal MI) after implementing other evidence-based 
interventions, such as statins.64 Recognizing the nature of the 
evidence also requires the revision of model-based estimates 
of the economic impact of tight glycemic control65,66 and mod-
eration of the exuberant support for policies of tight glycemic 
control with consequent overtesting and overtreatment.67,68 Any 
moderation will have to be delicately balanced against the risk 
of therapeutic nihilism. A careful and thoughtful recalibration 
is likely to promote patient trust in our efforts to advance their 
best interest. Today, patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, at 
least in certain parts of the world, seem to live longer lives 
with fewer complications.69–72 The evidence summarized here 
requires us to explore factors other than tight glycemic control 
to explain this improvement and better address the diabetes 
mellitus epidemic. Exciting new questions and new answers 
may surface as we look beyond glycemic control.
