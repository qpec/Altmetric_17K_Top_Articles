Cannabis and tobacco are common drugs of abuse worldwide and are often used 
in combination through various routes of administration (ROAs). Here, we aimed to 
provide an overview of how cannabis and tobacco routes varied across countries and 
assess the impact of tobacco-based ROAs on motivation to use less cannabis, and 
less tobacco, in different models. A cross-sectional online survey (Global Drugs Survey 
2014) was completed by 33,687 respondents (mean age = 27.9; % female = 25.9) 
who smoked cannabis at least once in the last 12 months. Most common ROA, fre-
quency of cannabis/tobacco use, and questions about motivation to use less cannabis/
tobacco were recorded. Tobacco-based ROA were used by 65.6% of respondents. 
These were most common in Europe (77.2–90.9%) and Australasia (20.7–51.6%) and 
uncommon in the Americas (4.4–16.0%). Vaporizer use was most common in Canada 
(13.2%) and the United States (11.2%). Using a non-tobacco ROA was associated with 
a 10.7% increase in odds for “desire to use less” tobacco (OR: 1.107, 95% CI: 1.003, 
1.221), 80.6% increase in odds for “like help to use less tobacco” (OR: 1.806, 95% CI: 
1.556, 2.095), and a 103.9% increase in the odds for “planning to seek help to use less 
tobacco” (OR: 2.039, 95% CI: 1.638, 2.539), in comparison to using a tobacco-based 
ROA. Associations between ROA and intentions to use less cannabis were inconsistent. 
Results support considerable global variation in cannabis and tobacco ROA. Tobacco 
routes are common, especially “joints with tobacco,” especially in Europe, but not in 
the Americas. Non-tobacco-based routes are associated with increased motivation to 
change tobacco use. Interventions addressing tobacco and cannabis need to accom-
modate this finding and encourage non-tobacco routes.

Cannabis and tobacco are two of the world’s most commonly used drugs, with recent prevalence 
statistics suggesting one billion people worldwide smoke tobacco, equating to 22.6% of adults. 
Cannabis is also the most commonly used illicit drug worldwide with 3.5% of adults (174 million 
people) using cannabis, with highest rates of use in Oceania (10.3%) (1).

Cannabis and Tobacco Routes of Administration
Frontiers in Psychiatry | www.frontiersin.org
July 2016 | Volume 7 | Article 104
Much of the research investigating cannabis and tobacco use 
suffers from being unable to detangle the association of cannabis 
with tobacco (simultaneous use; for example, in joints or blunts) 
and using cannabis and tobacco (concurrent use; cannabis smok-
ing and cigarette smoking separately), and there is a paucity of 
data available to detangle this. The distinction becomes important 
as those using cannabis with tobacco seem to have higher rates 
of DSM-IV cannabis abuse, even when adjusting for cannabis 
use and cigarette smoking (i.e., the independent use of both can-
nabis and tobacco) (2). Agrawal et al. (2) found that those who 
used smoked tobacco, in comparison to smokeless forms, were 
more likely to develop cannabis dependence. This may represent 
either a physiological adaption to “smoking” or may be related to 
cultural or social factors surrounding routes of administration 
(ROAs) (3).
Routes of administration, and especially inhalation ROAs, are 
important because the aerorespiratory alterations produced by 
smoking (e.g., cigarettes), may enable processes in favor of (e.g., can-
nabis) inhalation (3). ROAs are also important as they can alter the 
subjective experience of the drug (4). Use of tobacco (e.g., in joints) 
may confer a “practical advantage” to cannabis users, in as much as 
tobacco can increase the amount of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol 
(THC) inhaled per gram by up to 45% (5), and preclinical research 
suggests this tobacco pretreatment may increase the reinforcing 
properties of THC (6). Furthermore, smoking cannabis with inex-
pensive tobacco is economically advantageous as it dilutes the cost 
of the more expensive cannabis. Finally, it has been hypothesized 
that tobacco compensates for adverse cognitive and affective con-
sequences of cannabis (7, 8). Therefore, ROAs may play a large role 
in the use of both drugs and the effects of cannabis may indeed vary 
by ROA. Given the scale of use of cannabis and tobacco, there has 
been little effort toward prevention and treatment; however, initial 
results seem promising (9, 10).
This study provides a worldwide summary of ROAs for rec-
reational use of cannabis using data from the Global Drug Survey 
(GDS) 2014. Access to a worldwide sample allows us to collect 
data from participants who use various ROAs, which is not possi-
ble in single country samples (which are generally homogenous). 
Moreover, we aim to investigate if ROAs influence desire and 
motivation to quit cannabis and tobacco, after adjusting for the 
confounding effects of frequency of both drugs and demographic 
variables. Those who smoke cannabis and tobacco have poor ces-
sation outcomes (11), and cannabis use itself may act as a barrier 
to change as it is related to a cannabis amotivational syndrome 
(at least acutely)1. Motivations related to cessation are important 
preparatory steps in the quitting process (12) and are the key to 
some therapy styles, such as motivational enhancement therapy 
(13). Moreover, therapies designed to support motivation to quit 
have an impact on both cigarette smoking cessation (14) and can-
nabis cessation (15). We hypothesized that non-tobacco ROAs (in 
comparison to tobacco ROAs) will be associated with increased 
motivation to quit (i) cannabis and (ii) tobacco.

Design and Participants
The GDS is an anonymous, self-nominating, cross-sectional 
online survey of drug use, conducted annually, in partnership 
with global media partners. Participants are recruited through 
onward promotion and online social networks on websites, such 
as The Guardian, MixMag, The Ziet, and other International 
publications. Demographic information is also collected, includ-
ing age, gender, and country of residence. Data were collected 
throughout November 2013 and December 2013.
Sample
A total of 74,864 responses were received. The number of respond-
ents varied across countries; therefore, data were only included 
from countries with ≥500 respondents (n = 70,977; 94.8% of 
the sample) because of reliability considerations. Furthermore, 
analysis was restricted to respondents who had used cannabis 
at least once, in the past 12 months (n = 33,687, 47.4% of the 
whole sample). This is a low threshold for cannabis use; however, 
we sought to capture a wide range of variation in cannabis use 
(see Table S1 in Supplementary Material for a replication of this 
analysis with regular cannabis users). This sample was selected 
specifically to be cannabis users, and within this sample, we were 
interested in varying levels of tobacco from no use at all, i.e., 
vaporizer use to heavy use, i.e., smoking cannabis and tobacco 
joints. Moreover, there was no analogous threshold for tobacco 
as not all cannabis users smoke tobacco, and we also wanted to 
capture this. All participants confirmed that they were 18+ years 
and gave informed consent. This study was approved by the joint 
South London and Maudsley NHS and Institute of Psychiatry 
Ethics Committee. This study was carried out in accordance with 
the Declaration of Helsinki.
statistical analysis
All analyses were conducted in SPSS version 23 (IBM). Valid per-
centages are reported rather than absolute values for descriptive 
statistics to account for missing data. A list of assessments can be 
found in Table 1. Binary logistic regression was used to assess the 
effects of cannabis and tobacco, independently and combined, on 
six outcome variables that were considered a proxy to possible 
quitting behavior stages, as they align with the Stages of Change 
model (12) with each question requiring more commitment 
than the last (see cannabis assessments – items 2, 3, and 4 and 
tobacco assessments – items 1, 2, and 3). These were analyzed in 
different models, and “unsure” responses were removed from the 
analysis (there were a total 759 unsure response for “seek help 
to use less cannabis” and 1819 unsure responses to “seek help to 
use less tobacco”). Participants were not required to answer every 
question leading to missing data (see Missing Data); complete 
case analysis was used. As each of the motivation-based outcome 
questions were binary, analysis was undertaken using logistic 
regression. We included the following a priori variables to adjust 
for possible confounding variables: gender (binary; female as 
reference group) and age (in years). We then added frequency of 
cannabis use, frequency of tobacco use, and frequency of “can-
nabis mixed with tobacco” use. Finally, we used “most common

if the respondent has never used cannabis, for example, they would not have the 
opportunity to answer questions regarding cannabis.

ROAs,” which was coded dichotomously as either tobacco ROAs 
(reference group) (includes joint, blunt, pipe, bong/water pipe, 
and vaporizer with tobacco) or non-tobacco ROAs (includes joint, 
blunt, pipe, and bong/water pipe without tobacco). Adjusted 
odds ratios (aORs) and 95% confidence internals (95% CI) are 
reported for each model. An odds ratio (OR) >1 is suggestive of 
non-tobacco routes being associated with increased motivation to 
change in comparison to tobacco routes. Odds ratios <1 suggest 
non-tobacco routes being associated with reduced motivation to 
change in comparison to tobacco routes.
Exploratory Analysis
We also investigated the association of ROAs with age and gender. 
We conducted exploratory analyses using the Brown–Forsyth 
F-test, which is robust to violations in homogeneity of variance 
(and that of unequal sample sizes) to investigate the association 
between ROA (non-tobacco ROA vs. tobacco ROA), frequency 
of cannabis use, frequency of tobacco use, quantity of cannabis 
use, the negative impact of cannabis use, the pleasurable effects of 
cannabis use, and age of first tobacco use. Moreover, we compared 
those who used a vaporizer as a non-tobacco ROA and those who 
use other non-tobacco ROAs on frequency of tobacco use.
Missing Data
Respondents were not required to answer every question. There 
were 191 missing responses for “Would you like to use less cannabis 
over the next 12 months?” 14,484 missing responses for “Would 
you like help to use less cannabis over the next 12 months?” and 
14,456 missing responses for “Are you planning to seek help to use 
less cannabis over the next 12 months?” Missing data for “Would 
you like to use less tobacco over the next 12 months” was 3855 
responses, “Would you like help to use less cannabis over the next 
12 months” was 10,547 responses, and for “Are you planning to 
seek help to use less tobacco over the next 12 months” there 
were 10,432 missing responses. We did not impute the data, but 
instead, used valid percentages rather than absolute percentages 
where missing data occurred.
Sensitivity Analysis
We did not include the very infrequently chosen non-tobacco 
routes of “bucket bong,” “hot knife,” “in food,” “in drink,” or 
“other” (2.4% total). However, we did repeat the analysis with 
these variables combined with non-tobacco routes and replicated 
the results presented here. We also repeated the results by remov-
ing “cannabis mixed with tobacco,” as it was highly multicollinear 
with frequency of cannabis use; however, we report results with 
the frequency of “cannabis mixed with tobacco” predictor as it 
replicated the result without this variable. Finally, we replicated 
the results in a subpopulation of regular cannabis users who 
used cannabis >100 days in the last 12 months (see Table S1 in 
Supplementary Material).
resUlTs
global Overview of cannabis  
and Tobacco Use
Inspection of Table 2 indicates that the final sample were 
young, with a mean (SD) age of 27.86 (10.39) years. Across 
individual countries, mean (SD) age ranged from 22.38 (5.95) 
in The Netherlands to 32.95 (11.52) in Australia. 25.86% of all 
respondents were female. Gender was skewed toward more male 
respondents from The Netherlands (41.6% female) to Denmark 
(19.1% female).
Globally, tobacco ROAs were more common (65.6%) than 
non-tobacco ROAs (32.1%). Within the non-tobacco ROA 
group, 16.3% of the respondents had never tried smoking tobacco 
independently of cannabis. The most common tobacco ROA was 
smoking “joints with tobacco” (61.3%); alternative tobacco ROAs 
were seldom chosen. The most common non-tobacco ROA was 
“pipe” (11.7%) although “joint” was comparably frequent (9.5%).
Inspection of Table 2 suggests considerable global variation. 
First, tobacco ROAs were the predominant choice across all 
European countries (ranging from 90.9% in Switzerland to 77.2% 
in the UK). Across Europe, frequent adoption of tobacco ROAs 
was driven by the typical use of “joint with tobacco.” Although 
a disproportionately greater number of responses were collected 
from Germany, compared with responses from Portugal, Table 2 
indicates a high level of consistency in the tendency to use tobacco 
ROAs among European countries.

Cannabis and Tobacco Routes of Administration
Frontiers in Psychiatry | www.frontiersin.org

By contrast, in the Americas (Brazil, United States, Canada, and 
Mexico), the predominant choice is non-tobacco ROAs (88.8% 
total), ranging from 92.1% in United States to 79.8% in Canada. 
Within the Americas, there was considerable variation in the most 
common non-tobacco ROA. “Joint without tobacco” was almost 
exclusively reported among Brazilian respondents (80.8%), while 
the other counties tended to use a range of options including “pipe 
without tobacco” and “bong without tobacco.” Use of vaporizers 
was only frequent in Canada (13.3%) and the United States (11.2%).
Respondents from Australasia tended to choose a mixture of 
tobacco and non-tobacco ROAs. Australian respondents were 
more likely to choose a tobacco ROA (51.6%), mainly consist-
ing of not only “joint with tobacco” (37.0%) but also “bong with 
tobacco” (12.3%). New Zealand respondents tended to choose a 
non-tobacco ROA (70.2%) that consisted of a mixture of ROAs, 
predominantly “pipe without tobacco” (27.9%), “joint without 
tobacco” (23.7%), and “bong without tobacco” (15.0%).
Predicting intention to Use less 
cannabis/Tobacco from rOa
A total of 27.2% of all participants wanted to use less cannabis, 
16.1% wanted help to use less cannabis, and 4.6% said they were 
planning to seek help in the next year (Table 3). For tobacco, 
61.1% said that they would like to use less tobacco in the next year, 
22.8% stated that they wanted help to use less tobacco in the next 
12 months, and 10.2% said they were planning to seek help to use 
less tobacco in the next 12 months.
The odds for “desire to use less cannabis” were 0.625 times 
lower in the non-tobacco ROA group than in the tobacco ROA 
group. Conversely, non-tobacco ROAs were associated with 
a 61.5% increase in odds for “like help to use less cannabis in 
the next year” in comparison to those using tobacco ROAs. The 
effects of ROAs on “planning to seek help to use less cannabis” 
were not significant. Taken together, these results suggest that 
tobacco ROAs were not consistently associated with levels of 
motivation to change individuals’ cannabis use.
Among users of both tobacco and cannabis, non-tobacco 
ROAs were associated with a 10.7% increase in odds for “desire 
to use less tobacco.” Consistent with this, non-tobacco ROAs 
were associated with an 80.6% increase in “like help to use less 
tobacco in the next year” in comparison to tobacco ROAs. Finally, 
non-tobacco ROAs were associated with a 103.9% increase in the 
odds for “planning to seek help to use less tobacco.” Together, 
these results suggest that tobacco ROAs were consistently associ-
ated with reduced intention to use less tobacco. This analysis was 
replicated in those who smoked cannabis >100 days in the past 
12 months (see Table S1 in Supplementary Material).
exploratory analysis
ROA Associations with Age and Gender
There was a significant association between gender and ROA 
[χ2(1) = 48.51, p < 0.001]. More females used non-tobacco ROAs 
(36.2%) in comparison to tobacco ROAs (63.8%), and more males 
used tobacco ROAs (68.2%) in comparison to non-tobacco ROAs 
(31.8%). Moreover, those using a tobacco ROA (M = 26.23, 
SD = 8.48) were younger than those using a non-tobacco ROA 
(M = 30.79, SD = 12.76) [F(1, 14,622) = 1058.94, p < 0.001].
ROA Associations with Drug Use and  
Impact of Drug Use
Those using a non-tobacco ROA used cannabis on more days

using a tobacco-based ROA (M = 12.10, SD = 11.46) [F(1, 
19,089) = 109.82, p < 0.001] and they used more grams per 
day (M = 0.52, SD = 1.14) than tobacco ROA users (M = 0.42, 
SD = 0.84) [F(112, 556) = 55.05, p < 0.001]. Moreover, those 
using tobacco ROAs (M = 20.76, SD = 11.90) used tobacco more 
days per month than those using non-tobacco ROAs (M = 13.44, 
SD = 13.08) [F(1, 8501) = 1362.21, p < 0.001] and had started 
using tobacco slightly earlier (M = 14.65, SD = 2.80) than 
those using non-tobacco ROAs (M = 15.36, SD = 3.26) [F(1, 
14,149) = 304.62, p < 0.001]. There were more negative effects 
associated with the impact of cannabis in those using a tobacco 
ROA (M = 3.19, SD = 1.96) in comparison to a non-tobacco 
ROA (M = 2.52, SD = 1.70) [F(1, 19,957) = 846.64, p < 0.001]. 
Participants also found non-tobacco ROAs (M = 7.52, SD = 1.82) 
more pleasurable than tobacco ROAs (M = 7.11, SD = 1.84) [F(1, 
20,413) = 356, p < 0.001]. Moreover, a comparison between vapor-
izer users and other non-tobacco ROA users shows that vaporizer 
users use tobacco on less days per month (M = 9.53, SD = 12.00) 
than non-tobacco ROA users (M = 13.84, SD = 13.12) [F(1, 
645) = 58.87, p < 0.001].
DiscUssiOn
The aim of this study was to provide a global overview of cannabis 
and tobacco ROAs and to examine their association with motiva-
tion to use less cannabis and tobacco. Our results demonstrate 
marked global variation in tobacco/non-tobacco ROAs, with 
distinct patterns across Europe, the Americas, and Australasia. 
Non-tobacco ROAs were consistently associated with increased 
motivation to reduce tobacco use, although findings with can-
nabis were inconsistent. We also found those using tobacco 
ROAs were more likely to be male and younger than those using 
non-tobacco ROAs.
Notably, the Americas (Brazil, United States, Canada, and 
Mexico) had comparatively little use of tobacco ROAs. In North 
America, there was high use of vaporizers; devices that heat up 
cannabis electronically, allowing the vapor to be inhaled with-
out combustion (16). The trend toward cannabis vaporizers is 
significant as they may be less harmful than smoked cannabis 
(with or without tobacco). They may also be useful for harm 
reduction for respiratory problems and possibly tobacco use 
(17–19). Our data suggest a low prevalence of tobacco ROAs 
and a corresponding higher prevalence of vaporizer use in the 
United States and Canada, which may be an important predic-
tor of reduced future tobacco consumption among cannabis 
users in these countries. Indeed, those using vaporizers were 
using tobacco on fewer days per month in comparison to those 
using other non-tobacco ROAs in our exploratory analysis.
Recent prevalence statistics show that Oceania, which 
includes Australasia, has the highest levels of cannabis use 
(10.3%) (1). Our data suggest in Australia, the process of mix-
ing cannabis and tobacco is used by about half of those smoking 
cannabis and represents significant nicotine exposure. In New 
Zealand, on the other hand, tobacco ROAs are less common 
than non-tobacco ROAs. In comparison to the rest of the world, 
which tended to have high levels of one route, respondents in 
Australasian countries use various ROAs. However, we did not 
receive responses from every country worldwide, and analysis 
was restricted to countries with 500 or more respondents for 
reliability considerations. Future studies should aim to recruit 
from additional countries in order to reflect a “truly global 
sample.” Moreover, certain forms of coadministration of can-
nabis and tobacco are strongly governed by cultural norms and 
ethnicity (particularly in the United States), which might play 
a role in this association (20, 21) and could be investigated 
in future research. In this paper, we focused on age and sex, 
other covariates, such as alcohol, were not our focus, but future 
research may need to undertake model building approaches to 
ascertain which demographics should be included.
There are few studies that investigate the effects of ROA, but 
one recent study found those using “pure” cannabis (equivalent 
to non-tobacco ROAs in this study) showed less problematic 
cannabis use than those using cannabis mixed with tobacco (22). 
Our results are consistent with this and other previous research 
suggesting tobacco smoking is more problematic for those who 
also use cannabis (3, 23, 24), and we were also able to adjust for 
the frequency of cannabis and tobacco use. Our results suggest 
that tobacco ROAs are associated with a reduced motivation to 
use less tobacco and more negative effects of cannabis, which 
may account for the poor tobacco-related cessation reported 
previously (23, 24). Post hoc comparisons between those using 
non-tobacco ROAs in comparison to those using tobacco ROAs 
suggest that those using tobacco ROAs are heavier cigarette 
smokers and started using tobacco earlier. Moreover, only 16% of 
the present sample were using a non-tobacco ROA and had never 
tried tobacco suggesting within cannabis users that it is rare to 
have never tried tobacco.
We also found ROA was not necessarily associated with poor 
cannabis-related motivations for cessation. An alternative expla-
nation for this finding is that we used a low threshold for cannabis 
use (once in the last 12 months); however, we did account for 
the increasing cannabis use in our model which included days 
per month of cannabis use and predicted motivation to change. 
Moreover, we replicated the analysis in regular cannabis users 
(see Table S1 in Supplementary Material). Interestingly, those 
using a non-tobacco ROA were using cannabis on more days per 
month, more cannabis per day, and found non-tobacco ROAs 
more pleasurable, in comparison to those using a tobacco-
based ROA, replicating other recent online survey results (25). 
Practically, this may be related to not having an inexpensive filler 
to use, but it may also be a factor related to low motivations to 
use less cannabis. Recent attempts to create cessation programs 
for co-users seem promising (9, 10); however, in order to tailor 
tobacco cessation programs for those who smoke cannabis, fur-
ther emphasis should be on the use of non-tobacco ROAs as this 
may increase the likelihood and effectiveness of future tobacco 
quit attempts.
The implications of tobacco ROAs for clinical and public 
health consequences of cannabis use are significant. Table 4 
provides an overview of possible strategies, and their evidence 
base, for reducing and preventing cannabis and tobacco co-use, 
as well as directions for future research. The concurrent use of 
both substances leads to poorer outcomes for cessation attempts 
than for either drug alone, plays a role in the maintenance of 
 TaBle 4 | summary of strategies for reducing and preventing cannabis and tobacco co-use and areas and future directions.
strategy
evidence-base
Promote reduction 
of both simultaneous 
and co-occurring use
Simultaneous users are 5.1 times more likely to experience cannabis dependence (3, 22)
Cigarette smoking alongside cannabis use increases symptoms of cannabis dependence and relapse (27, 41)
In comparison to those with cannabis dependence alone, those who are also nicotine dependent have more severe psychosocial and 
psychiatric outcomes (42)
Promote alternative 
ROAs, such as 
vaporizers
Vaporizers may be an acceptable harm reduction intervention to promote as they do less damage to the respiratory system (43).
Users rate vaporizers as the most important way of reducing cannabis-related harms (www.globaldrugsurvey.com/brands-highwaycode)
Avoid e-cigarettes
75% of cannabis vaporizer users have also used a nicotine e-cigarette (25).
Marketing of cannabis vaporizers alongside e-cigarettes may increase co-use and these devices should be separated at the point of sale
Motivation to change
Administering cannabis without tobacco may increase motivation to reduce tobacco use
Regional variation
Administering cannabis with tobacco is most common in Europe.
Dialog between policies to reduce tobacco smoking and those regarding cannabis may be helpful
Future directions
Vaporizers
Further research is required to better define the harm reduction benefits of vaporizers on respiratory health and function as well as potential 
harms and/or benefits associated with vaporizer use
Harm reduction
Health promotion campaigns should focus on dissociating the use of tobacco and cannabis and should consider differential harm reduction 
campaigns for cannabis users who smoke cannabis with tobacco
Monitoring
A more accurate description of how cannabis is consumed worldwide through better monitoring and screening tools is required
Controlled 
experimental studies
Investigating the reasons behind simultaneous use with hypothesis-driven controlled experimental studies including researching the acute 
psychopharmacological interaction on cognition (8) and reward is warranted

cannabis use, and leads to more significant cannabis withdrawal 
in isolation (26–28). Concurrent use is associated with synergis-
tic pulmonary harms, and tobacco use significantly increases the 
risk of malignancy and may independently be associated with 
an increased risk of developing psychosis (29). Many cultures 
have adopted non-tobacco ROAs suggesting it is possible to for 
users to “enjoy” cannabis without tobacco, and it is noteworthy 
that countries reporting the lowest rates of tobacco ROAs also 
reported the highest use of vaporizers.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first global overview 
of cannabis and tobacco ROAs. Our design afforded us the abil-
ity to collect a large sample rapidly and on an unprecedented 
various ROAs. This methodology has advantages and disadvan-
tages including those surrounding reliability and validity at a 
population-based level, as discussed elsewhere (30–33). Online 
surveys are considered a credible vehicle for opportunistic 
research and are valuable where current data are scarce, as is the 
current case. These data, therefore, provide a snapshot of the use 
of cannabis and tobacco ROAs, where there is a paucity of epide-
miological data [also see Ref. (16, 25)]. Epidemiological data on 
the prevalence of certain ROAs, such as vaporization, have yet to 
be conducted (34), and the GDS has the size and cross-cultural 
representativeness allowing insight into the changes occurring in 
cannabis ROAs. Moreover, longitudinal studies are necessary to 
identify the patterns in co-use over time as cannabis legalization 
spreads (35, 36).
This study had some limitations. First, we used a self- 
nominating convenient (drug-using) sample using an Internet 
survey that this may have some reliability and validity issues that 
include the limited ability to generalize to the countries included 
in our analysis (30–33). Therefore, these estimates should be 
treated with caution until replicated; although our data on UK 
ROAs show consistency with a previous GDS sample of UK can-
nabis users (37). Furthermore, the observed consistency within 
large geographical regions (especially Europe and the Americas) 
does lend support to genuine global variation; however, our 
sample was skewed toward people of a young age. Moreover, 
we did not measure self-reported cannabis dependence and/or 
tobacco dependence. Cannabis exposure variables can be poor at 
predicting cannabis use disorders (38), the prevalence of which 
varies worldwide (39). Furthermore, we focused on our hypoth-
eses regarding cannabis and tobacco co-use and did not consider 
the role of other poly-drug use, including alcohol, which clearly 
plays an important role (40) or the role of combinations of ROAs 
on which there is evidence to suggest the greater the number 
of ROAs used, the more problematic the cannabis use (22). 
We modeled three dependent variables each for cannabis and 
tobacco, which were related to increased motivation to use less 
of that drug (12); however, these were not clinically validated 
and can only provide preliminary evidence on motivation to use 
less of each drug.
cOnclUsiOn
Among a global sample of cannabis users, tobacco ROAs are 
frequently adopted. This is especially true in European coun-
tries, followed by Australasia, and then the Americas, where 
non-tobacco ROAs are more common. Non-tobacco ROAs 
were associated with greater motivation to change tobacco use 
and, therefore, may reduce the harmful consequences of can-
nabis use.
