ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND Cardiac troponin is an independent predictor of cardiovascular mortality in individuals without
symptoms or signs of cardiovascular disease. The mechanisms for this association are uncertain, and a role for troponin
testing in the prevention of coronary heart disease has yet to be established.
OBJECTIVES This study sought to determine whether troponin concentration could predict coronary events, be
modified by statins, and reflect response to therapy in a primary prevention population.
METHODS WOSCOPS (West of Scotland Coronary Prevention Study) randomized men with raised low-density lipoprotein
cholesterol and no history of myocardial infarction to pravastatin 40 mg once daily or placebo for 5 years. Plasma cardiac
troponin I concentration was measured with a high-sensitivity assay at baseline and at 1 year in 3,318 participants.
RESULTS Baseline troponin was an independent predictor of myocardial infarction or death from coronary heart disease
(hazard ratio [HR]: 2.3; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.4 to 3.7) for the highest ($5.2 ng/l) versus lowest (#3.1 ng/l)
quarter of troponin (p < 0.001). There was a 5-fold greater reduction in coronary events when troponin concentrations
decreased by more than a quarter, rather than increased by more than a quarter, for both placebo (HR: 0.29; 95% CI: 0.12
to 0.72 vs. HR: 1.95; 95% CI: 1.09 to 3.49; p < 0.001 for trend) and pravastatin (HR: 0.23; 95% CI: 0.10 to 0.53 vs.
HR: 1.08; 95% CI: 0.53 to 2.21; p < 0.001 for trend). Pravastatin reduced troponin concentration by 13% (10% to 15%;
placebo adjusted, p < 0.001) and doubled the number of men whose troponin fell more than a quarter (p < 0.001),
which identified them as having the lowest risk for future coronary events (1.4% over 5 years).
CONCLUSIONS Troponin concentration predicts coronary events, is reduced by statin therapy, and change at
1 year is associated with future coronary risk independent of cholesterol lowering. Serial troponin measurements
have major potential to assess cardiovascular risk and monitor the impact of therapeutic interventions.

 W
OSCOPS (West of Scotland Coro-
nary Prevention Study) was a
trial of statin-based low-density
lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol-lowering ther-
apy in men ages 45 to 64 years with raised
serum cholesterol concentrations. The trial
participants had no history of myocardial infarction
and were randomized to receive pravastatin or pla-
cebo for an average of 5 years. Treatment reduced
the risk of a range of cardiovascular endpoints by
about one-third (1), and extended follow-up over 15
years revealed that the risk reduction persisted long
term (2). This and other similar trials established the
benefits of intervention in asymptomatic high-risk
subjects (3,4), but debate continues over the merits
of drug therapy in the wider primary prevention
setting (5–7). One approach to resolve this issue has
been the search for biomarkers that enhance risk
prediction.
Cardiac troponin is a specific marker of myocardial
injury and an independent predictor of cardiovascu-
lar mortality in patients with and without cardiovas-
cular disease (8–14). Novel high-sensitivity assays can
now accurately measure plasma cardiac troponin I
concentrations in everyone. Higher troponin con-
centrations may reflect subclinical coronary artery
disease and identify those at greatest risk who could
benefit from targeted preventative therapies. The
aims of this study were to determine whether cardiac
troponin I concentrations could predict future coro-
nary events, be modified by statins, and assess
response to therapy in WOSCOPS.
METHODS
STUDY POPULATION. WOSCOPS randomized 6,595
men ages 45 to 64 years with moderate hypercholes-
terolemia (LDL cholesterol concentrations 152 to 228
mg/dl) and no prior history of myocardial infarction
to receive placebo or pravastatin 40 mg/day. The
design and conduct of the study have been described
elsewhere (1,15). The study exclusion criteria are
reported in full in the Online Appendix. Plasma was
obtained before randomization and at 1 year, and was
stored at –80�C. For the present analysis, we identi-
fied all participants with sufficient stored plasma at
both time points. As a result, 3,318 of the 6,595 study
participants
were
included.
The
research
ethics
committee of the University of Glasgow and all
participating centers approved the trial design, and
the participants provided written informed consent.
TROPONIN ASSAY. Cardiac troponin I concentrations
in stored plasma were determined at baseline and at
1
year
using
the
ARCHITECTSTAT
high-sensitive
troponin I assay (Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park,
Illinois). The limit of detection is 1.2 ng/l, and the
interassay coefficient of variation is <10% at 4.7 ng/l.
The upper reference limit or 99th-centile value is
34 ng/l in men (16). All samples underwent centrifu-
gation twice (3,000 relative centrifugal force for
10 min) to ensure samples were visibly homogeneous
according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
CLINICAL OUTCOMES AND RECORD LINKAGE. The
primary outcome of the trial was a composite of
nonfatal myocardial infarction (including nonhospi-
talized silent myocardial infarction) and death from
coronary heart disease. During the formal trial period,
patients were followed for an average of 4.9 years to
determine the occurrence of the primary endpoint
and other events, which were adjudicated by an
endpoints committee (1,15). Additional follow-up for
up to 15 years after randomization was available
through the interrogation of records held by the Na-
tional Health Service for Scotland (2). Myocardial
infarction events during the trial period included si-
lent infarction, whereas those over the 15-year period
were based only on hospitalization.
STATISTICAL
ANALYSIS. The
distribution
of
troponin
I
was
skewed,
and
values
were
log-
transformed
before
analysis.
Participants
were
divided into quarters of the distribution of baseline
troponin
concentration.
Comparisons
of
baseline
characteristics
between
groups
were
made
using
chi-square test for categorical variables and 1-way
analysis of variance or the Kruskal-Wallis test for
continuous variables. Multivariable Cox proportional
hazards regression analyses were used to evaluate the
associations between baseline and change in troponin
concentration at 1 year with risk of coronary events
over 5 and 15 years in the study population and a
subgroup with no symptoms or signs of coronary
heart
disease
at
enrollment.

 change in troponin was determined from the con-
centration at 1 year relative to the concentration
at
baseline,
and
the
association
with
percent
change in LDL cholesterol over the same period was
assessed using the Pearson correlation coefficient. An
independent-samples Student t test was used to
compare the mean change between treatment groups.
Participants who had a coronary event before the
1-year visit were excluded for the purpose of this
analysis. The effect of change in troponin on coronary
events at 5 years was explored further by splitting
both treatments into 5 groups based on quintile cut-
points in the placebo group. Determinants of log-
transformed baseline troponin I were investigated
using stepwise linear regression at p-to-enter of 0.10
and p-to-stay of 0.05. Analyses were performed using
SPSS version 20.0.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, New York),
SAS Enterprise Guide 5.1 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary,
North Carolina), and R version 3.0.0 (R Project for
Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). Statistical
significance was taken as a 2-sided p < 0.05.
RESULTS
Baseline characteristics of the 3,318 participants in
this analysis were similar to the full study population
(Online Table 1).
DISTRIBUTION
OF
TROPONIN
AT
BASELINE. The
median
troponin
concentration
at
baseline
was
4.0 ng/l, with an interquartile range of 3.1 to 5.2 ng/l.
Values were above the limit of detection (1.2 ng/l)
in 3,311 participants (99.8%) and above the 99th-
centile (34 ng/l) in 48 participants (1.5%). For the
purpose of this analysis, 7 participants with unde-
tectable troponin concentrations were assigned a
value of 1.2 ng/l.

Troponin, Statins, and Coronary Disease Risk
2721
 Participants were stratified into quarters of the
baseline troponin concentration (Table 1). Compared
to the lowest quarter, participants in the upper
quarters were older and were more likely to have a
history of hypertension, symptoms of angina, and
minor
abnormalities
on
the
electrocardiogram
(p < 0.001 for all). Those in the highest quarter had
higher
systolic
and
diastolic
blood
pressures
(139 � 18 mm Hg vs. 133 � 17 mm Hg and 85 � 11 mm Hg
vs. 83 � 11 mm Hg, respectively), and there were small
differences in total and LDL cholesterol concentra-
tions across the quarters (4 and 5 mg/dl, respectively).
In contrast, there were no significant differences in
high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglyceride
concentrations or the prevalence of diabetes mellitus.
In a stepwise linear regression model, higher base-
line troponin concentrations were associated with
increased
age,
body
mass
index,
systolic
blood
pressure, and LDL cholesterol concentrations, and a
higher prevalence of anginal symptoms and minor

Higher troponin concentrations at baseline were associated with increased risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) at both 5- and 15-year
follow-up. Compared to the lowest quarter (#3.1 ng/l), patients in the highest quarter ($5.2 ng/l) were at the highest risk for nonfatal
myocardial infarction or death from CHD at 5 and 15 years (hazard ratio: 2.27; 95% confidence interval: 1.42 to 3.65; and hazard ratio: 1.54;
95% confidence interval: 1.16 to 2.05, respectively; p < 0.001 for both). Cardiovascular death was also associated with baseline troponin
concentration (p < 0.001), but noncardiovascular death was not (p ¼ 0.890).

BASELINE
TROPONIN
AND
RISK
OF
CORONARY
HEART DISEASE EVENTS. Higher troponin concen-
trations at baseline were associated with increased
risk of coronary heart disease at both 5- and 15-year
follow-up (Figure 1, Online Table 3). Compared to
the lowest quarter (#3.1 ng/l), patients in the highest
quarter ($5.2 ng/l) were at the highest risk for
nonfatal myocardial infarction or death from coro-
nary heart disease at 5 and 15 years (HR: 2.27; 95% CI:
1.42 to 3.65 and HR: 1.54; 95% CI: 1.16 to 2.05,
respectively; p < 0.001 for both). All-cause mortality
and
cardiovascular
death
were
also
associated
with
baseline
troponin
concentration,
but
non-
cardiovascular
death
was
not.
In
a
sensitivity
analysis, similar relationships were observed for the
primary endpoint in 2,882 men without symptoms
or signs of coronary heart disease at enrollment
(Online Figure 1).
In this subset of the original study, the HR for the
overall relative
treatment effect for the primary
endpoint at 5 years was 0.45 (95% CI: 0.32 to 0.65;
p < 0.001) and for the outcome of coronary death or
hospitalized myocardial infarction at 15 years was
0.68 (95% CI: 0.56 to 0.83; p < 0.001). There was no
evidence of an interaction between treatment effect
and
quarters
of
baseline
troponin
concentration
(p ¼ 0.67 and p ¼ 0.19, respectively, for the 5- and 15-
year outcomes) (Online Table 4). At 15 years, the
absolute risk reduction in nonfatal myocardial infarc-
tion or death from coronary heart disease was greatest
in the highest quarter (9.0%) compared to the lower
three quarters (2.6% to 3.0%) (Online Figure 2).
CHANGE
IN
TROPONIN
AND
LDL
CHOLESTEROL
WITH
TREATMENT. At 1 year, participants taking
pravastatin had a greater reduction in troponin con-
centration (19%) (95% CI: 17% to 20%) than those
receiving placebo (6%) (95% CI: 4% to 8%; p < 0.001)
(Figure 2). The absolute change in troponin concen-
tration from baseline with pravastatin was 2.0 ng/l
(interquartile range: 1.2 to 2.8 ng/l; p < 0.001).
Change in troponin concentration on treatment cor-
related
weakly
with
change
in
LDL
cholesterol
(r ¼ 0.20; p < 0.001).

RISK
REDUCTION. After
adjustment
for
multiple variables (including baseline troponin con-
centration, and baseline and change in LDL choles-
terol), change in troponin concentration at 1 year was
an independent predictor of nonfatal myocardial
infarction or death from coronary heart disease at
both 5 and 15 years in both treatment arms (Table 2).
To explore this relationship further, participants were
divided into fifths based on the change in troponin
concentration in the placebo group. There was a clear
gradient of risk across change in troponin. In the pla-
cebo group, relative to the referent (middle) fifth,
those in the top fifth (>26% increase) had a higher risk
of the primary endpoint over 5 years, and those in

 the bottom fifth (>27% decrease) had a lower risk
(p < 0.001 for trend) (Figure 3). In those taking pra-
vastatin, a similar trend was observed, but twice as
many men were in the lowest-risk group, with >27%
reductions in troponin concentration (645 vs. 320 on
placebo; p < 0.001), and 30% fewer were in the highest
risk group, with >26% increase in troponin concen-
tration (223 vs. 320 on placebo; p < 0.001). The risk of
the primary endpoint in participants on pravastatin
was 5-fold lower in those with the greatest reduction in
troponin concentration (HR 0.23; 95% CI: 0.10 to 0.53)
compared to those with the greatest increase in
troponin concentration (HR 1.08; 95% CI: 0.53 to 2.21;
p < 0.001 for trend) despite similar reductions in LDL
cholesterol concentration (22% to 28%). Compared to
placebo, participants taking pravastatin with the
greatest reduction in troponin at 1 year (highest
quarter: $38% reduction vs. lowest quarter: >3% in-
crease) had the largest reduction in cardiovascular
events (HR: 0.21. 95% CI: 0.08 to 0.52 vs. HR: 0.82; 95%
CI: 0.51 to 1.32, respectively; p ¼ 0.002), whereas the
reduction in events was similar across quarters of
change in LDL cholesterol (p ¼ 0.823) (Online Figure 3).
DISCUSSION
We observed a strong, specific, and independent as-
sociation between baseline and 1-year change in
plasma troponin I concentration and the onset of
coronary
heart
disease
over
5
and
15
years
in
WOSCOPS. Troponin concentrations were reduced by
pravastatin therapy, which doubled the number of
men whose troponin fell by more than a quarter and
were at the lowest risk for future coronary events.
Thus, pravastatin treatment caused similar relative
risk reductions in each category of troponin change
and increased the propensity for troponin concen-
trations to fall, leading to additive decrements in
future risk that appeared to be independent of LDL
cholesterol
lowering.
We
conclude
that
high-
sensitivity cardiac troponin assays can be used to
predict future risk of coronary heart disease and to
assess response to statin therapy (Central Illustration).
Therefore, serial troponin measurements appear to
have major potential to monitor risk and assess the
impact
of
established
or
novel
therapeutic
in-
terventions on future coronary heart disease risk.

analysis
has
a
number
of
important
and
distinctive strengths that distinguish it from previous
studies of troponin in coronary heart disease risk
prediction. First, we evaluated plasma troponin con-
centration in a primary prevention setting rather than
in populations that included patients with estab-
lished coronary heart disease. Second, we had access
to
prolonged
robust
clinical
follow-up
of
well-
characterized
participants
over
a
15-year
period.
Third, we used the latest-generation high-sensitivity
cardiac troponin I assay, which detected troponin in
99.8% of the study population. Finally, in addition to
exploring associations with baseline troponin con-
centration, we were able to critically assess dynamic
changes in troponin concentrations as part of a major
randomized placebo-controlled trial of statin therapy.
In WOSCOPS, a number of biomarkers have been
assessed for cardiovascular risk stratification (17–19).
In previous analyses, C-reactive protein predicted
both cardiovascular and noncardiovascular events
(19), whereas troponin is a specific biomarker for the

 prediction
of
coronary
heart
disease
outcomes.
Interestingly, in contrast to recent studies of patients
with established coronary heart disease (8), we found
that troponin predicted fatal and nonfatal myocardial
infarction rather than heart failure events. Similar
associations were recently reported in individuals
without cardiovascular disease who participated in
the JUPITER (Justification for the Use of Statins in
Primary Prevention) trial (20). This finding likely re-
flects differences in the extent of coronary heart dis-
ease at enrollment, the use of concomitant therapies,
and the low prevalence of heart failure events.
The association between troponin and coronary
heart disease risk is nonlinear, with an apparent
threshold at 5.2 ng/l that identifies those 2 to 3 times
more likely to have a coronary event over 15 years. This
is consistent with findings from other cohorts using
the same assay (21), in which receiver-operating curve
analysis identified a threshold of 6 ng/l in a random-
ized trial population with established coronary heart
disease (14) and 7 ng/l in men who participated in the
Scottish
Heart
Health
Study
(12).
Interestingly,
troponin concentrations <5 ng/l also identify patients
as low risk in the emergency department (21), and
increasingly this approach is being used to rule out
myocardial infarction in clinical practice. Primary
prevention guidelines recommend statins for the pre-
vention of cardiovascular disease in any individual
with a 10-year estimated risk of a cardiovascular event
>7.5% (22). This approach has been widely debated,
with the benefits and risks for the individual more
evenly balanced (5–7). We believe cardiac troponin
may help to better stratify those healthy individuals at
risk for coronary heart disease who would benefit most
from statin therapies and that this approach should be
formally addressed in prospective trials.
We
hypothesized
that
statin
therapy
would
reduce cardiac troponin concentrations. However,
the observations that a large majority of participants
on pravastatin had lower troponin concentrations at
1 year and that this reduction correlated with the
decrease in LDL cholesterol were unexpected. White
et al. (23) reported that cardiac troponin concentra-
tions were reduced with pravastatin in patients with
coronary heart disease. However, troponin concen-
trations were measured by a contemporary sensitive
assay and were undetectable in more than one-third
of patients and were below the limit of analytical
precision in the majority. As such, the assay had
insufficient sensitivity to evaluate the relationship
among pravastatin therapy, troponin concentration,
and LDL cholesterol. In contrast, we used a novel
high-sensitivity
assay
that
was
able
to
measure
cardiac troponin in >99% of our study population.

hypertension, family history of premature coronary heart disease, minor electrocardio-
graphic abnormalities, nitrate use, and smoking status. The risk of the primary endpoint in
participants taking pravastatin was 5-fold lower in those with the greatest reduction in
troponin concentration (hazard ratio: 0.23; 95% confidence interval: 0.10 to 0.53)
compared to those with the greatest increase in troponin concentration (hazard ratio:
1.08; 95% confidence interval: 0.53 to 2.21; p < 0.001 for trend) despite similar
reductions in LDL cholesterol concentration (22% to 28%).

Troponin, Statins, and Coronary Disease Risk
2725
 This allowed us to explore associations among change
in troponin, LDL cholesterol, and coronary events.
We observed that change in troponin predicted
risk with an approximately 5-fold range in HRs when
comparing men with the greatest increases and de-
creases in troponin concentration. We observed the
lowest rate of coronary heart disease events (1.4%
over 5 years) in men treated with pravastatin whose
troponin concentration fell by more than a quarter
and the highest in those taking placebo with an in-
crease in troponin of more than a quarter (11.6% over
5 years). Although LDL cholesterol level is currently
used to select patients for statin therapy and to
monitor treatment response, it was notable that
neither baseline nor change in LDL cholesterol pre-
dicted future coronary events. Importantly, pravas-
tatin more than doubled the likelihood of a reduction
in troponin concentration and this appeared to be
independent of LDL cholesterol lowering. In addition
to reducing serum cholesterol concentrations, statins
reduce the levels of other oxidized proteins, improve
endothelial
nitric
oxide
bioavailability,
and
slow
progression of atherosclerosis (24). Our observations
suggest the preventative effects of statin therapy are
mediated in part by these other mechanisms. It was
surprising that change in troponin concentration at
1 year was an independent predictor of risk in the
placebo group, in which LDL cholesterol concentra-
tions were unchanged. It is possible that cardiac
troponin concentrations are modulated by a minor
fraction, such as oxidized LDL, that is not reflected
when
measuring
total
LDL
concentration.
Such
oxidized lipoproteins may influence troponin con-
centration directly through a toxic effect on car-
diomyocytes or indirectly through their effects on
nitric oxide bioavailability and myocardial perfusion.
We speculate that recruitment to WOSCOPS may
have increased awareness of cardiovascular risk in
some trial participants, thereby inducing lifestyle
modifications that both lower cardiac troponin con-
centration and improve outcomes.
A biomarker that can dynamically track the risk of
coronary heart disease over time would be a major
step forward. Indeed, previous studies have failed to
demonstrate that changes in inflammatory, hemo-
static, or lipid biomarkers can predict future cardio-
vascular
risk
(17–19).
This
unique
property
of
change of troponin with time has major ramifications
and suggests that serial high-sensitivity troponin
measurements could represent a major surrogate
biomarker to help manage our patients and evaluate
coronary heart disease risk with established or novel
cardiovascular and noncardiovascular therapies.
STUDY
LIMITATIONS. The trial was conducted in
middle-aged men with raised cholesterol levels, and
the findings may not be applicable to the wider pop-
ulation including women. This is an important point,
as the threshold of 5.2 ng/l that identified men at
increased risk in our study population may not apply
to women or to other groups (16). We were able to
obtain results from only 3,318 participants, and the
requirement for a 1-year sample restricted the study
population to those who were compliant with the

 protocol. This is the most likely explanation for the
apparently greater treatment effect in this study
compared to the intention-to-treat risk reduction re-
ported previously (8). Our analysis was performed on
samples stored for 20 years, and it is possible we
underestimated the association between troponin
and coronary heart disease events because of inter-
ference from the formation of fibrin microparticulates
during storage. Although the effect of pravastatin on
troponin concentrations was highly consistent across
the study population, the absolute and relative re-
ductions were modest at 2 ng/l and 19%, respectively.
Although assay precision is very good at concentra-
tions below our median concentration of 4.1 ng/l
(w10% coefficient of variation) (25) and even smaller
changes
in
cardiac
troponin
concentration
were
strongly
associated
with
coronary
heart
disease
events across the study population, we acknowledge
it will be more challenging to monitor changes accu-
rately in individual patients. Changes in troponin
concentration of 2 ng/l after initiation of statin
therapy may be masked by other aspects of biological
or analytical variability (26). However, there are
methodological approaches to reduce the former, for
example,
performing
duplicate
measurements
2
weeks apart, and novel technologies that enhance
assay precision through single molecular counting
that will minimize the latter (27). Before this approach
can be applied in clinical practice, prospective studies
are needed to determine whether we can consistently
quantify small changes in cardiac troponin I concen-
tration in response to treatment in individuals.
CONCLUSIONS
Cardiac troponin I is an independent predictor of
coronary heart disease events in middle-aged hyper-
cholesterolemic
men
without
prior
myocardial
infarction.
Troponin
concentrations
are
reduced
by
statin
therapy,
and
reductions
in
troponin
concentrations are associated with better outcomes
independent
of
LDL
cholesterol
lowering.
These
findings
suggest
that
high-sensitivity
cardiac
troponin has major potential to identify those at
greatest risk and to assess their response to in-
terventions for the prevention of coronary heart dis-
ease.
Finally,
serial
high-sensitivity
troponin
concentrations may represent a new paradigm in the
assessment of the efficacy and safety of novel car-
diovascular and noncardiovascular therapies.

PERSPECTIVES
COMPETENCY IN MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE: In
hypercholesterolemic men, plasma cardiac troponin I concen-
trations correlate with the onset of coronary heart disease over 5
and 15 years and are reduced by statin therapy. Reductions in
troponin concentrations are associated with better outcomes
independent of LDL cholesterol lowering.
TRANSLATIONAL OUTLOOK: Further studies are needed to
clarify the predictive value of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I
assays to identify persons at increased risk and assess whether
other interventions that lower plasma troponin levels reduce the
risk of coronary heart disease.
