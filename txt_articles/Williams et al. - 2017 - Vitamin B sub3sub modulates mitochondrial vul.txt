Abstract
Glaucomas are neurodegenerative diseases that cause vision loss, especially in the elderly. The 
mechanisms initiating glaucoma and driving neuronal vulnerability during normal aging are 
unknown. Studying glaucoma-prone mice, we show that mitochondrial abnormalities are an early 
driver of neuronal dysfunction, occurring prior to detectable degeneration. Retinal levels of 
nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+; a key molecule in energy and redox metabolism) 
decrease with age, and render aging neurons vulnerable to disease-related insults. Oral 
administration of the NAD+ precursor nicotinamide (vitamin B3), and/or gene therapy (driving 
expression of Nmnat1, a key NAD+ producing enzyme), was protective both prophylactically and 
as an intervention. On our highest dose, 93% of eyes did not develop glaucoma. This supports 
therapeutic use of vitamin B3 in glaucoma and potentially other age-related neurodegenerations.
Glaucoma is a group of complex, multifactorial diseases characterized by the progressive 
dysfunction and loss of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), leading to vision loss. Glaucoma is 
one of the most common neurodegenerative diseases worldwide, affecting over 70 million 
people (1). High intraocular pressure (IOP) and increasing age are important risk factors for 
glaucoma (2, 3). However, specific mechanisms rendering retinal ganglion cells more 
vulnerable to damage with age are unknown. Here, we address how increasing age and high 
IOP interact to drive neurodegeneration using DBA/2J (D2) mice, a widely used model of 
chronic, age-related, inherited glaucoma (4).

 We utilized RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) to elucidate age and IOP-dependent molecular 
changes within RGCs that precede glaucomatous neurodegeneration. We analyzed RGCs of 
9 month old (mo) D2 mice (termed early glaucoma - high IOP and molecular changes but 
lacking neurodegeneration (2)), 4 mo old D2 mice (precedes high IOP) and age, sex and 
strain matched D2-Gpnmb+ controls (do not develop high IOP or glaucoma (4)) (Fig. 1). 
RGCs were isolated (Fig. S1) and their RNA sequenced at a depth of 35 million reads per 
sample. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering (HC) allowed molecular definition of early 
glaucoma stages among samples that were still morphologically indistinguishable from age-
matched D2-Gpnmb+ or young controls. HC identified 4 distinct groups of 9 mo old D2 
samples (Groups 1 to 4). Group 1 clustered with all of the control samples and represents D2 
RGCs with no detectable glaucoma at a molecular level. Although Groups 2 to 4 were all 
early stages, increasing group number reflects greater glaucoma progression at a 
transcriptomic level (Fig. 1A, Fig. S2A and B). As disease progressed, there was an increase 
in transcript abundance that was most pronounced for mitochondrial reads (Fig. 1B). 
Emerging evidence suggests that imbalances in the relative proportions of mitochondrial 
proteins encoded by nuclear and mitochondrial genomes negatively impact mitochondrial 
function (5). In D2 Groups 2 to 4, differential expression of genes encoding mitochondrial 
proteins, and significant enrichment of differentially expressed (DE) genes in the 
mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative phosphorylation pathways further point to 
mitochondrial abnormalities (Fig. 1B–G, Fig. S2C–G, Table S1–3). Pathway analysis 
identified enrichment of eIF2 and mTOR signaling transcripts (Fig. 1C). eIF2 is a key 
regulator of redox homeostasis and cellular adaptations to stress and was the most enriched 
pathway in Group 2 (first distinguishable stage from controls). Through mTOR inhibition, it 
promotes survival in the presence of oxidative stress (6–8) and likely protects from 
mitochondrial abnormalities in RGCs at this early disease stage. Mitochondrial fission (Fig. 
1F) and mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPRmt) genes were also DE (Fig. 1G) (9–
11). Electron microscopy (EM) revealed abnormal mitochondria with reduced cristae 
volume in the dendrites of D2 RGCs, but not in those of control RGCs (Fig. 1H and I). 
These mitochondrial EM findings coincide with synapse loss in 9 mo D2 retinas (12), with 
early decreases in pattern electroretinogram amplitude (PERG) (13), and an increase in 
retinal cytochrome c levels (Fig. S2D and F). Extending previous studies (14, 15), our data 
demonstrate that mitochondrial perturbations are among the very first changes occurring 
within RGCs during glaucoma.
Guided by the above data, we assessed metabolites in retinas with increasing age and disease 
(D2 and D2-Gpnmb+; 4, 9, and 12 mo). We detected early decreases in metabolites that are 
central to healthy mitochondrial metabolism and protection from oxidative stress (NAD+ and 
NADH [total NAD; NAD(t)], GSH and GSSG [total glutathione; glutathione(t)]) (Fig. 2A, 
Fig. S2H–I). These age-dependent decreases were not a response to IOP-insult(s) as they 
also occurred in control D2-Gpnmb+ retinas (Fig. S2I). These decreases are expected to 
sensitize retinal neurons to disease related stresses and mitochondrial dysfunction. 
Suggesting greater metabolic stress in RGCs than other retinal neurons, HIF-1α (a key 
metabolic regulator during perturbed redox states (16)) is induced in the ganglion cell layer 
early in glaucoma (Fig. S3A and B). Our data suggest that RGCs go through a period of 
mitochondrial stress and metabolite depletion, potentially moving towards fatty acid

 metabolism (Fig. S4). Fatty acid β-oxidation can increase generation of free radicals/reactive 
oxygen species (ROS) (17). Both RNA-seq (Fig. S2C) and γ-H2AX immunostaining (Fig. 
S2J and K) support increased ROS and DNA damage within RGCs early in glaucoma. 
Providing a link between DNA damage, and increased metabolic stress, PARP activity 
(NAD consuming) is induced in RGCs with age (Fig. S5A and B).
Our data support a model where age-dependent declines of NAD+ and glutathione in the 
retina render RGCs vulnerable to damage from elevated IOP. Thus, increasing NAD levels 
would be predicted to protect IOP-insulted eyes from glaucomatous changes, by decreasing 
the probability of metabolic/energetic failure and rendering the RGCs more resilient to IOP-
induced stress. Oral supplementation of vitamin B3/nicotinamide (NAM; a precursor of 
NAD) has been successfully used to correct disturbances in NAD+ metabolism in two mouse 
models of pre-eclampsia (18). Accordingly, we administered NAM to D2 mice, initially at 
the same dose (550 mg/kg/d, NAMLo) (Fig. 2). NAM administration in drinking water 
prevented the decline of NAD levels through to 12 mo (a standard end stage for assessing 
neurodegeneration in this glaucoma model) (Fig. 2A). Supporting our neuronal vulnerability 
hypothesis, NAMLo did not alter IOP (Fig. S6), but protected from glaucoma. NAM was 
protective both prophylactically (starting at 6 mo, prior to IOP elevation in most eyes in our 
colony) and interventionally (starting at 9 mo, when the majority of eyes have had 
continuing IOP elevation) (Fig. 2B). NAM significantly reduced the incidence of optic nerve 
degeneration (Fig. 2B and E), prevented RGC soma loss and retinal nerve fiber layer 
thinning (Fig 2C and E), and protected visual function as assessed by PERG (13) (Fig. 2D, 
Fig. S3E). NAM prevented RGC axonal loss, and these axons continued to support 
anterograde axonal (Fig. 2E). NAM administration was sufficient to inhibit the formation of 
dysfunctional mitochondria with abnormal cristae (Fig. 2E, Fig. S3G and H) and also 
limited synapse loss that occurs in this model (12) (Fig. S3C and D). Lipid droplet formation 
was also prevented in aged D2 retinas (Fig. S3F). NAM also decreased PARP activation, 
limited levels of DNA damage, and transcriptional induction of HIF-1α (Fig. S3A and B) 
reflecting less perturbed cellular metabolism. NAM prevented even the earliest molecular 
signs of glaucoma in most treated eyes as assessed by RNA-seq (Fig. 2F and G, Fig. S7) and 
prevented the majority of age-related gene expression changes within RGCs (Fig. S8). This 
highlights the unexpected potency of NAM in decreasing metabolic disruption and 
prevention of glaucoma.
Attempting to further decrease the probability of glaucoma, we administered a higher dose 
of NAM (2000mg/kg/d; NAMHi). NAMHi was extremely protective with 93% of treated 
eyes having no optic nerve damage (Fig. 2B). The degree of protection afforded by 
administering this single molecule is unprecedented and unanticipated. Although NAMLo 
demonstrates a clear neuroprotective effect (no effect on IOP), NAMHi lessens the degree of 
IOP elevation (Fig. S6). This indicates that NAM can protect against age-related pathogenic 
processes in additional cell types to RGCs (11, 16, 19). Therefore vitamin B3/NAM, a single 
molecule that protects against both IOP elevation and neural vulnerability, has great 
potential for glaucoma treatment, however human studies are needed.
NMNAT2 is emerging as an important NAD producing enzyme in axons, protecting from 
axon degeneration (20). Ongoing stress negatively impacts Nmnat2 expression in RGCs (q <

 0.05 in D2 Group 4) (Fig. S7F). This decline of NMNAT2 may induce vulnerability to axon 
degeneration in glaucoma. NMNAT2 expression is decreased in brains with Alzheimer’s 
disease and is highly variable in aged postmortem human brains (21). Such variation in 
expression may contribute to individual differences in vulnerability to various 
neurodegenerations.
Glaucoma is a complex disease involving multiple insults. Mechanical axon damage and 
local inflammation are two important contributors in glaucoma (22–24). To more fully 
assess the general effectiveness of NAM treatment, we tested its efficacy in two models of 
RGC death that are used to model these glaucomatous insults. We used a tissue culture 
model of axotomy, and intravitreal injections of soluble murine TNFα which can drive local 
inflammation as well as mitochondrial dysfunction and is implicated in glaucoma (25). 
NAM robustly protected cultured retinas from RGC somal degeneration (Fig. S9AB). NAM 
also protected against a loss of PERG amplitude and cell loss in TNFα injected eyes (Fig. 
S9C–E). Given these protections against severe acute insults, NAM could have broad 
implications for treating glaucoma and potentially other age-related neurodegenerative 
diseases.
Gene therapy is an attractive approach for overcoming compliance issues and improving 
efficacy. In the eye, gene therapy has proven successful for rare human Mendelian disorders 
(26). Viral gene therapy allows a large number of cells to be transfected lifelong, delivering a 
targeted gene product. To date, gene therapy has not been successfully applied to complex 
human diseases. Given that age is a common risk factor for most glaucomas, protecting from 
age–related declines in NAD may generally protect many glaucoma patients. Thus, we 
sought to support NAD+ producing cellular machinery through the overexpression of 
Nmnat1, a terminal enzyme in NAD+ production, further testing our NAD hypothesis. 
(Using NAMPT, the rate-limiting enzyme in NAD synthesis, may be complicated both by its 
cytokine functions and over-production of NMN, which may participate in axon 
degeneration (27).) D2 eyes were injected once with AAV2.2 containing the Nmnat1 gene 
and GFP under a CMV promoter expressed as a single transcript (Fig. 3). Nmnat1 
expression (as assessed by GFP expression) was robust in RGCs 2 weeks after injection 
(expressed in >83% of RGCs), and remained robust through to the end stage time point (12 
mo) (Fig. S10). Overexpression of Nmnat1 was sufficient to prevent axon and soma loss 
(Fig. 3A–D), to preserve axoplasmic transport, (Fig. 3B) and to preserve electrical activity in 
RGCs (PERG) (Fig. 3E). Glaucomatous nerve damage was absent in >70% of treated eyes. 
Since NMNAT1 catalyzes the terminal step in NAD production, the major protective effects 
of NAM treatment likely results from driving NAD production in neurons rather than other 
NAD independent mechanisms (but partial contributions from other mechanism cannot be 
completely ruled out). We further assessed the effects of combinational therapy of Nmnat1 
and NAMLo. This combination afforded significant additional protection over Nmnat1 or 
NAMLo alone with 84% of eyes having no detectable glaucoma (~4-fold decreased risk of 
developing glaucoma). Increasing the NAM dose combined with gene therapy may prove 
even more protective.
In conclusion, we show that dietary supplementation with a single molecule (vitamin B3/
nicotinamide), or Nmnat1 gene therapy, significantly reduces vulnerability to glaucoma by

 supporting mitochondrial health and metabolism. Combined with established medications 
that lower IOP, NAM treatment (and/or Nmnat1 gene therapy) may be profoundly 
protective. By providing a new molecular and metabolic link between increased neuronal 
vulnerability with age and neurodegeneration these findings are of critical importance for 
glaucoma and possibly other age-related diseases.

= differentially expressed at q < 0.05 compared to D2-Gpnmb+ 9 mo control. (B, D, and E) 
* = P < 0.05, ** = P < 0.01, *** = P < 0.001 (Student’s t test). For boxplots, center hinge 
represents the mean, and the upper and lower hinges represent the first and third quartiles, 
whiskers represent 1.5 * interquartile range, values beyond the whiskers are plotted as 
outliers. See also Fig. S4, Tables 1–3.

 Fig. 3. Gene therapy protected eyes from glaucomatous neurodegeneration
D2 eyes were intravitreally injected at 5.5 mo with AAV2.2 carrying a plasmid to 
overexpress murine Nmnat1 under a CMV promoter. (A) Nmnat1 overexpression prevented 
RGC soma loss (red, scale bar = 50 μm) and loss of anterograde axoplasmic transport (n = 
10/group) (as demonstrated in Fig. 2.) (B; red, scale bar = 100 μm). Nmnat1 gene therapy 
also protected D2 eyes with elevated IOP against optic nerve degeneration (n > 40/group; 
*** = P < 0.001, Fisher’s exact test) (C), soma loss (n = 6/group) (D), and PERG amplitude 
(n > 20/group) (E). Addition of NAMLo in drinking water afforded additional protection 
against optic nerve degeneration (Nmnat1 compared to Nmnat1 + NAMLo = P < 0.001, 
Fisher’s exact test) (C). (D and E) ** = P < 0.01, *** = P < 0.001 (Student’s t test).
