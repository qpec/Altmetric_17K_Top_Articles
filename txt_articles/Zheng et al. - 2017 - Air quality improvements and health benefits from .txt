Abstract
Aggressive emission control measures were taken by the Chinese government after the promulgation
of the ‚ÄòAir Pollution Prevention and Control Action Plan‚Äô in 2013. Here we evaluated the air quality

decreased by 21.5% over China during 2013‚Äì2015, reducing from 60.5 in 2013 to 47.5 ùúág m‚àí3 in

5-attributable mortality decreased from 1.22 million (95% CI:
1.05, 1.37) in 2013 to 1.10 million (95% CI: 0.95, 1.25) in 2015, which is a 9.1% reduction. The
limited health benefits compared to air quality improvements are mainly due to the supralinear
responses of mortality to PM2.

1. Introduction
The rapid development of China in recent decades
has consumed an enormous amount of energy, which
has led to severe air pollution. High loading of fine par-
ticulate matter with aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5
ùúám (PM2.
5) is now a serious environmental and social
problem in China and has attracted substantial atten-
tion [1, 2]. Exposure to PM2.
5 can cause adverse health
effects including cardiovascular and respiratory mor-
bidity and mortality [3, 4]. According to the Global
Burden of Disease 2015 comparative risk assessment
(GBD 2015), outdoor PM2.
5 exposure contributes to
approximately1.1milliondeathsinChinaannually[5].
To improve air quality and protect public health,
the state council of China promulgated the ‚ÄòAir Pollu-
tion Prevention and Control Action Plan‚Äô (the Action
Plan) in 2013 [6], which demanded reductions of
PM2.
5 concentrations for three key regions, namely,
the Beijing‚ÄìTianjin‚ÄìHebei (BTH) region, the Yangtze
River Delta region, and the Pearl River Delta region,
by 25%, 20%, and 15% by 2017 as compared to
the 2013 levels, respectively. Aggressive measures have
been taken in support of the Action Plan by national
and local governments and remarkable reductions in
PM2.
5 concentrations were observed by national mon-
itoring networks during the first half of the Action Plan
implementation period (i.e. 2013‚Äì2015).
To date, several studies have considered prema-
ture mortality induced by long-term PM2.

the health burden was alleviated by the rapid air qual-
ity improvements since 2013 have not been reported.
Assessment of air quality and health benefits of the
Action Plan requires accurate knowledge of the spatial
and temporal variation of PM2.

2. Materials and methods
2.1. WRF‚ÄìCMAQ modeling system
The Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model
version v3.5.1 [19] and the Models-3 Community
Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model version 5.1
[20] were used to simulate daily variation of PM2.

of 36 km √ó 36 km. The WRF model is driven by the
National Centers for Environmental Prediction Final
Analysis (NCEP-FNL) reanalysis data [21] as initial
and boundary conditions. Meteorological parameters
simulated by the WRF model together with emission
inventories were applied to drive the CMAQ model.
Anthropogenic emissions for mainland China dur-
ing 2013‚Äì2015 were derived from the Multi-resolution
EmissionInventoryofChina(MEIC)model[22],while
anthropogenic emissions for other Asian countries and
regions were obtained from the MIX Asian emission
inventory [23]. Details of model configurations are
documented in Zheng et al [24] as well as in the
supplementary information ((SI) text S1 available at
stacks.iop.org/ERL/12/114020/mmedia).
In this study, the WRF‚ÄìCMAQ modeling system
was utilized in two parts. First, continuous PM2.

ulations from the WRF‚ÄìCMAQ model were used as a

2.3. Evaluation of premature mortality attributable

To evaluate the premature mortality attributable to
PM2.
5 exposure, the relationships between chronic
exposure and attributable mortalities, which are called
C‚ÄìR relationships, must be determined. The IER
functions developed for the Global Burden of Dis-
eases Study include cohort studies at high levels of
exposure concentrations (i.e. active and second-hand
tobacco smoke) and provide C‚ÄìR relationships for a
full range of ambient PM2.

are suitable for relevant studies in China. We uti-

were considered, including lung cancer (LC), chronic

[18]:

that determine the shape of C‚ÄìR curves. A distribution
of 1000 point estimates of C0, ùõº, ùõæ, and ùõø param-
eters provided by the IER were utilized to calculate
mean RR and its 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We
further employed the following equation to calculate

of population growth and mortality incidence changes
on the estimated mortality variations, we applied mor-
tality incidence of 2010 for mortality estimation during
2013‚Äì2015. The cause-specific national mortality inci-
dence statistics for all population subgroups in 2010
were obtained from the Ministry of Health of China
[37] (SI: table S4). Because IER provides age-specific
C‚ÄìR functions for stroke and IHD, the attributable
mortality of these two endpoints are calculated by age

clean air actions in these polluted regions. Air quality
improvements in China have led to certain pub-
lic health benefits. However, due to the nonlinear

while the decreasing trends in premature deaths remain

social media for the effectiveness of control measures
[43, 44]. To quantify the impacts of the inter-annual
variation of meteorology, we conducted sensitivity
simulations by using the CMAQ model with fixed

5 concentrations during 2013‚Äì2015
were mainly attributed to reductions in anthropogenic
emissions from the implementation of China‚Äôs clean
air action plan rather than inter-annual meteorological
variations.
The Action Plan introduced ten measures to
improve air quality, including multi-pollutant emis-
sions control, industrial structures optimization, and
energy structures adjustment. According to the MEIC
model [22], the emission control on heavily polluted
sectorsreachedahighlevelin2015.Forexample,during
2013‚Äì2015, the implementation ratio of desulphuriza-
tion devices increased from 80% to 86% for coal-fired
power plants and the average denitrification efficiency
increased from 29% to 53%. Meanwhile, according to
the National Bureau of Statistics of China [45], produc-
tion in heavily polluted industrial sectors, including pig
iron, cement, and float glass, decreased by 2.5%, 2.8%,
and 5.2%, respectively, which likely reflected the opti-
mization of the industrial structure. In addition, the
national energy consumption increased by 3.2% dur-
ing 2013‚Äì2015, with the share of coal declined by 3.4%
and the share of clean energy (i.e. energy other than
coal and oil) increased by 2.4%. Driven by the Action
Plan, the stricter emission control, industrial structures
optimization, and energy structures adjustment may
be the key reasons for the reduction in air pollutant
emissions.
Although the Action Plan have led to a consider-
able PM2.

air quality improvements in this period were limited,
which was likely caused by the supralinear responses
of cause-specific mortality to ambient PM2.

wheremarginalmortalityreductionsarelimited.More-
over, our study suggests that the mortality burdens
induced by air pollution are also severe in less polluted
provinces (see figure 3(b)), where greater marginal
mortality reductions can be achieved [40, 46]. To
improve air quality and protect public health, current
policies should remain in place, and stricter measures
should be implemented in the future.
