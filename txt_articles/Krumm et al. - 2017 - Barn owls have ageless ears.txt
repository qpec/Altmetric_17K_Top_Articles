We measured the auditory sensitivity of the barn owl (Tyto alba), using a
behavioural Go/NoGo paradigm in two different age groups, one younger
than 2 years (n ¼ 4) and another more than 13 years of age (n ¼ 3). In
addition, we obtained thresholds from one individual aged 23 years, three
times during its lifetime. For computing audiograms, we presented test
frequencies of between 0.5 and 12 kHz, covering the hearing range of the
barn owl. Average thresholds in quiet were below 0 dB sound pressure
level (SPL) for frequencies between 1 and 10 kHz. The lowest mean
threshold was –12.6 dB SPL at 8 kHz. Thresholds were the highest at
12 kHz, with a mean of 31.7 dB SPL. Test frequency had a significant
effect on auditory threshold but age group had no significant effect. There
was no significant interaction between age group and test frequency.
Repeated threshold estimates over 21 years from a single individual
showed only a slight increase in thresholds. We discuss the auditory sensi-
tivity of barn owls with respect to other species and suggest that birds,
which generally show a remarkable capacity for regeneration of hair cells
in the basilar papilla, are naturally protected from presbycusis.
1. Background
Growing old as a human is commonly accompanied by a progressive deterio-
ration of hearing abilities. Typically, this deficit is already evident at the most
peripheral stages of the auditory system—middle and inner ear (cochlea)—
and is summarized under the term presbycusis or age-related hearing loss.
Of course, not only humans suffer from presbycusis, the sensory deficit gener-
ally applies to all ageing mammals and is most prominent at high frequencies
[1]. Presbycusis has been shown, for example, in Mongolian gerbils (Meriones
unguiculatus) [2,3], in mice (Mus musculus) [4] and in chinchillas (Chinchilla
laniger) [5]. Presbycusis in mammals is commonly associated with a loss of
hair cells at the sensory epithelium, i.e. the organ of Corti of the cochlea.
While mammals are able to at least partly regenerate sensory hair cells in the
vestibular system, they cannot replace hair cells in the cochlea [6]. By contrast,
some vertebrate groups other than mammals have conserved the ability to
regrow hair cells in the inner ear and are thus much less susceptible to perma-
nent damage [6]. Birds, in particular, have been studied extensively for
mechanisms of hair-cell regeneration after various insults to their basilar
papilla, the avian homologue of the mammalian organ of corti [6–9]. Impor-
tantly, several studies [10–12] reported a very low level of ongoing hair-cell
proliferation even in undamaged basilar papillae of different bird species,
suggesting that the regenerative mechanisms remain active throughout life.
Studies involving acoustic trauma or treatment with ototoxic drugs have
revealed a remarkable capacity for regeneration and concomitant recovery of
auditory function in birds [8,13–16]. There are also limits, however, and hair-
cell regeneration remains incomplete if the damage extends to supporting
cells, which are the source of new hair cells [13,14]. Some structural abnormal-
ities may persist in regenerated regions of the basilar papilla, such as an
incomplete tectorial membrane or an abnormal innervation pattern [13].
Depending on the original extent of damage, functional recovery of auditory
sensitivity tended to be less complete at higher frequencies [14,15]. It is there-
fore an interesting question whether the regenerative capacity is sufficient to

 prevent presbycusis during the entire lifespan of a bird. Lan-
gemann et al. [17] conducted the first long-term study to
investigate the change in auditory performance in a bird,
the European starling (Sturnus vulgaris), with behavioural
methods. They measured auditory sensitivity at different
times over the lifespan of European starlings and found no
substantial age-related hearing loss. So far, to our knowledge,
this is still the only study with behavioural data on age-
related hearing loss in birds. Here, we characterize the
auditory sensitivity of the barn owl (Tyto alba) at different
times during its life. The barn owl is a predatory bird with
remarkably sensitive hearing that also outperforms other
vertebrates in spatial hearing (reviewed in [18]).
The barn owl is a famous model in auditory research. It
relies on its sense of hearing for hunting prey, similar to
some other birds like the marsh hawk (Circus cyaneus) or the
tawny owl (Strix aluco) [19–21]. The typical lifespan of a
barn owl is rather short for a bird of its size, and most barn
owls in the wild live between about 1 and 4 years [22–26].
Owing to a nocturnal lifestyle that heavily relies on auditory
cues for hunting, the barn owl has been extensively studied
with respect to sound localization [20,27]. A host of anatomical
and physiological specializations has been found to contribute
to the barn owl’s superb localization performance, starting
with the facial ruff and asymmetrical ear openings that gener-
ate enhanced physical cues [28,29]. The sensitive hearing range
of the barn owl extends from about 200 Hz up to 12 kHz,
which is extended on the high-frequency side relative to that
of most other bird species [28]. This has its basis in a special-
ized cochlea with a basilar papilla that is by far the longest
among birds [30,31]. Its low-frequency apical part appears
morphologically similar to the basilar papilla of other birds,
but the high-frequency basal region shows several unusual
features, suggesting a specialization for high-frequency proces-
sing [30,32]. The tonotopic frequency representation along a
typical bird basilar papilla is described by an exponential
function [33,34]. By contrast, barn owls show a tonotopic dis-
tribution with an extreme over-representation between 4 and
10 kHz: more than half of the length of the basilar papilla rep-
resents this narrow frequency range [31]. Such an extreme
specialization is found in no other bird species. However, it
resembles the ‘auditory fovea’ that is known from constant
frequency bats like the horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus rouxi) and
the moustached bat (Pteronotus parnelii) [35,36]. Thus, the ques-
tion arises whether, compared to the relatively unspecialized
starling, the barn owl’s ability to regenerate hair cells is not
lost as a result of these specializations.
The aim of this study was to determine the auditory
sensitivity of the barn owl into old age. For computing audio-
grams, we measured auditory thresholds at different test
frequencies covering the hearing range of the barn owl. We
had two different groups of barn owls, one group younger
than 2 years and another group of owls more than 13 years
old. In addition, we obtained auditory thresholds from one
individual barn owl three times during its 23 years of life.
We discuss differences between the two different age
groups and raise the question whether birds that generally
show a remarkable capacity for repairing damage to the basi-
lar papilla might be naturally protected from presbycusis.
Since age-related hearing loss in mammals is most obvious
at high frequencies, the high-frequency over-representation
of the barn owl might be the ideal case to test for presbycusis
in birds.
2. Material and methods
(a) Subjects
Our subjects were seven barn owls (Tyto alba), three of which
hatched in 1993 (Weiss, Gru
¨n, Rot) and two in 1997 (Lisa, Bart)
at the Technical University of Munich. Two further individuals
hatched in 2015 at University of Oldenburg (Ugle, Sova). The
birds from each group were siblings and they were hand
reared from the age of about 12 days. The barn owls were
divided into two groups: Four individuals were assigned to the
group of ‘young barn owls’ (Ugle, Sova, Gru
¨n, Rot) and the
remaining three were assigned to the group of ‘old barn owls’
(Bart, Lisa, Weiss). If we had thresholds from the same individ-
ual at ‘young’ and ‘old’ age, we had assigned them to only one
age group to obtain independent data. The ‘young’ owls were
less than 2 years old at the start of the measurement, whereas
the ‘old’ owls were 13 years and 17 years of age (two individuals
and one individual, respectively). The barn owls wore jesses and
were trained to come onto the experimenter’s fist on demand,
e.g. at the start or the end of an experimental session. The barn
owls were housed individually in indoor aviaries. Food rewards
during the experiment and supplementary food consisted of
small pieces of one-day chicks (Gallus gallus). The owls’
weight was monitored daily and the motivation of the animals
was controlled by maintaining a body weight 10–15% below
their free-feeding weight. The care and treatment of the birds
were approved by the Regierung von Oberbayern, Bavaria,
Germany, and by the Landesamt fu
¨ r Verbraucherschutz und
Lebensmittelsicherheit, Lower Saxony, Germany.
(b) Test signals
To measure the auditory threshold curve, we tested frequencies
of 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6.3, 8, 10 and 12 kHz. All of these signals were
pure tones with a total duration of 300 ms (10 ms Hanning
ramps). The first thresholds obtained in 1994 [37] were deter-
mined with a longer duration of 800 ms (50 ms linear rise and
fall time). Assessing temporal summation in another bird
species, Klump & Maier [38] found that temporal summation
in the European starling was most effective for signals shorter
than 200 ms [38]. We therefore concluded that comparing barn
owl auditory thresholds using different, longer durations was
valid.
(c) Experimental set-up
Experiments were carried out in two different sound-attenuating,
echo-reduced chambers: in 1994 in a custom-built chamber of
1.8 � 1.7 � 2.0 m3 [37], later in an IAC (Industrial Acoustics)
chamber type 1203-A of 2.2 � 2.1 � 2.0 m3 (inside dimensions).
The chambers were lined with sound-absorbing foam (Illbruck
GmbH; cut-off frequency 500 Hz, a . 0.99; total attenuation:
48 dB at 500 Hz, greater than 57 dB for frequencies greater than
or equal to 1 kHz) and illuminated by a 20 W halogen light.
The owls worked either within an experimental cage (1.2 �
1.0 � 1.0 m3) or were allowed to freely roam the chamber
without being confined by a cage. In either case, there were
two perches, a waiting perch and a target perch, mounted
between the mesh walls of the cage or on a pedestal. A single
loudspeaker
(in
1994:
KEF
C35;
2010
and
2016:
Vifa
XT25TG30-04) was located at 08 in azimuth, opposite the
owl’s waiting perch. Close to the target perch (but outside the
main sound transmission path) was a custom-built automatic
feeder delivering food rewards. To monitor the owl’s position
and behaviour, the perches were equipped with infrared light
barriers and the entire experiment was video-monitored.
In 1994, all behavioural protocols including the delivery of
food rewards were computer controlled. Pure tone signals were

 produced by an 8-bit digital-to-analogue converter and amplified
using a Harmon-Kardon HK6500 amplifier [37]. In the later
experiments, a Linux-operated computer controlled the exper-
iments via an enhanced real-time processor (RP2, Tucker Davis
Technologies). The signals were generated by an external sound-
card (Hammerfall DSP Multiface II, RME) and passed through a
Rotel RMB-1048 amplifier to drive the loudspeaker. The sound
field of the acoustic chamber was calibrated before the start of
the experiments with the microphone (Bru
¨el & Kjær 4188 micro-
phone and 2238 Mediator sound level meter) placed at a range
of positions where the barn owl’s head would be during
experimental test sessions.
(d) Procedure of operant testing
Auditory thresholds in quiet were estimated using a Go/NoGo
paradigm. The owls were trained to sit and stay on the waiting
perch with their head oriented towards the loudspeaker.
During one experimental session, an owl had to complete a
series of test trials. As soon as the light barrier of the waiting
perch was interrupted by the perching owl, a trial was started
and a random time interval between 1 and 30 s initiated after
which a test signal was presented. If the owl responded by
flying to the target perch within 5 s after the onset of the test
signal, this response was scored as a ‘hit’ and the animal was
rewarded. The response period in 1994 was set to 10 s; however,
Dyson et al. [37] observed that 99% of all the responses occurred
within 5 s. If the owl did not respond, then that test trial was
scored as a ‘miss’. To assess the rate of spontaneous responses,
we introduced ‘catch trials’ where no test signal was presented
(20–30% of all trials). A response of the owl to a catch trial
was scored as a ‘false alarm’, and no response was scored as
a ‘correct rejection’.
(e) Estimating auditory thresholds
For each individual owl, the test frequency was kept constant
for successive experimental sessions until a threshold for this
frequency was obtained; thereafter the test frequency was chan-
ged.
To
minimize
training
effects,
the
sequence
of
test
frequencies was randomized for each individual. Depending
on the training level of the owl (young, inexperienced; old,
very experienced) each test frequency required between about
one and two weeks until the final threshold was reached.
Thresholds for each test frequency were obtained by the
method of constant stimuli [39]. A block of eight trials, consist-
ing of two catch trials and a set of six test trials differing in
sound-pressure level by a step-size of 3 dB was repeated several
times during a session, with a randomized sequence of trials in
each block (in 1994 blocks consisted of three catch trials and
seven test trials [37]). In all measurements, experimental ses-
sions were excluded from the analysis if the false alarm rate
exceeded 20% or if the two signals with the highest sound-
pressure levels (SPLs) were reported with a probability below
80%. For a final threshold estimate, we collected at least four
valid experimental sessions to ensure that each SPL was pre-
sented 20 times (in 1994 at least 15 times). The final threshold
was then computed by linear interpolation of the psychometric
function as the SPL for which the value of the signal-detection
measure d’ was 1.8.
(f) Data analysis
We performed a two-way repeated measures analysis of variance
(ANOVA) to test for the within-subject effects of frequency (0.5,
1.0, 2.0, 4.0, 6.3, 8.0, 10.0, 12.0 kHz) and the between-subject
effect of age (young/old) on the owls’ auditory thresholds (in
dB SPL). Tukey tests were used for post hoc comparisons. For
main effects and interactions, we computed partial Eta squared
(h2) as a measure of effect size. Partial h2 measures the degree
of association between an effect and the dependent variable
and can be interpreted as the proportion of variance in the
dependent variable that is attributable to each effect (partial h2
varies between 0 and 1, and is non-additive). The influence of
a variable is thus not judged by the magnitude of the associated
p-value. In addition, partial h2 is a reliable indicator of relevant
effects also in cases when sample size is too small to detect a sig-
nificant difference at the conventional significance level of 0.05.
Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS v. 23.0 (IBM
SPSS Statistics) or SIGMASTAT v. 4.0 (Systat Software, Inc.).
3. Results
(a) Comparing young and old barn owls
In a behavioural paradigm, we estimated the auditory
sensitivity of barn owls from two different age groups. Test
frequencies
for
obtaining
individual
audiograms
were
between 0.5 and 12 kHz. Barn owls are far more sensitive
than most other bird species, their thresholds in quiet being
below 0 dB SPL for a wide range of frequencies. The mean
thresholds in quiet are shown in figure 1, and individual
thresholds are listed in tables 1 and 2. The lowest thresholds
were found between 2 and 8 kHz in both age groups
(figure 1). At test frequencies of 0.5, 1.0 and 6.3 kHz, the
thresholds of the old owls were slightly lower (better) than
those of the young owls (mean differences between 0.1 and
3.1 dB). At the remaining test frequencies, the thresholds of
the young owls were lower than those of the old owls
(mean differences between 0.9 and 9.6 dB). These differences
were not significant, however (see statistics below). Young
owls had average thresholds of 26.9, 210.4, 26.5 and
215.5 dB SPL at 2, 4, 6.3 and 8 kHz, respectively. The mean
thresholds of old owls were very similar: 25.9, 27.8, 26.6
and 28.6 dB SPL at 2, 4, 6.3 and 8 kHz, respectively. In
both age groups, 8 kHz was the test frequency with the
lowest mean threshold (figure 1; tables 1 and 2). The highest
thresholds were those at the extremes of the audiogram,
about 5 dB at 0.5 kHz and about 32 dB at 12 kHz, reflecting

 the decrease in sensitivity at both ends of the basilar papilla
[40]. Individual thresholds were most variable at 6.3 kHz
(tables 1 and 2), however, without any relation to age. Two
young individuals as well as one of the old individuals
showed relatively high thresholds, whereas the remaining
two young and two old individuals showed rather low
thresholds. The most sensitive frequency of the individual
audiogram was at either 6.3 or 8 kHz (tables 1 and 2). We
probed for significant differences between the two age
groups by means of a repeated measure ANOVA. Test fre-
quency had a significant effect on auditory thresholds (F ¼
76.700, p , 0.001, h2 ¼ 0.939). This main effect explained
most of the variation in thresholds, as indicated by the
effect size. By contrast, age group was not a significant
predictor of auditory thresholds (F ¼ 1.407, p ¼ 0.289, h2 ¼
0.220). There was no significant interaction between fre-
quency and age group (F ¼ 1.729, p ¼ 0.134, h2 ¼ 0.257).
We used multiple-comparisons to identify test frequencies
that were significantly different from each other. The test
frequency of 12 kHz was significantly different to any of
the other test frequencies (Tukey tests, q-values between
27.0 and 16.9, all p , 0.001). Similarly, 0.5 kHz was signifi-
cantly
different
to
all
other
test
frequencies
(q-values
between 10.1 and 4.6, p � 0.001 with one exception: p ¼
0.047 for 0.5 versus 1 kHz). We also found a significant differ-
ence between 1 and 8 kHz (q ¼ 5.5, p ¼ 0.01). None of the
remaining pairwise-comparisons were significant.
(b) Tracking Lifetime thresholds
From one of the individuals (Weiss) we obtained audiograms
several times during its lifetime. Thresholds were measured
for the first time at the age of 22 months (started at 18
months, completed at 22 months of age), i.e. when the audi-
tory sensitivity of the barn owl is fully developed [41].
Additional audiograms were obtained much later, at the age
of 17 and 23 years, as shown in figure 2. Threshold changes
were larger between the first and the second threshold esti-
mate than between the second and the third estimate.
Between about 2 and 17 years of age, threshold at test frequen-
cies of 2, 4, 6.3, 10 and 12 kHz increased between 10.5 and
14.5 dB, while thresholds at 0.5, 1 and 8 kHz changed much
less (21.0, þ7.2, þ6.9 dB, respectively). Between 17 and 23
years of age, thresholds were within a few decibels (between
about 24 and þ4 dB), with the exception at 10 kHz, where
thresholds increased by about 11 dB. These repeated threshold
estimates from a single individual show that thresholds
changed, but did not necessarily deteriorate, with age.

dependent
(figure 1). Statistical testing, however, found no significant
differences between the two age groups. The variability in
thresholds between individuals was largest at 6.3 kHz,
although the mean thresholds for young and old owls were
essentially
identical
(26.5
and
26.6 dB,
respectively,
tables 1 and 2). In addition, threshold variability was not
related to the acoustic chamber in which they were measured.
Overall, our data from the two age groups and from the
single individual measured several times indicate that barn
owl ears do not deteriorate with age.
The auditory sensitivity of our barn owls compares
favourably to the audiogram of a single barn owl shown in
a paper by Konishi [20] (figure 1). At first glance, Konishi’s
owl seems about 8–10 dB more sensitive than our owls.
There are, however, a few differences between the two
studies. Firstly, the threshold criteria between our study
and the Konishi study were different. While we used the
signal-detection measure d’ with a threshold criterion of 1.8,
Konishi [20] defined 75% correct responses as the threshold
criterion, with no indication for the rate of spontaneous
responding. Secondly, Konishi [20] presented the audiogram
of only one of the three owls tested in his study and stated
that these were the data from the barn owl that was the
‘most carefully tested’. We thus have no knowledge about
the ‘average performance’ of Konishi’s owls. Thirdly, we
used barn owls from the Old World species group (Tyto
alba), while Konishi employed New World barn owls (Tyto
furcata, formerly Tyto alba pratincola) [42,43]. These two
groups have different body sizes [41]; the size of their basilar
papilla is, however, the same [30,31,44]. Many studies have
also employed barn owls from both groups as an animal
model in central auditory physiology or anatomy and there
appears to be no substantial difference between the species
groups [30,31,44]. We thus conclude that the species differ-
ence between our study and the Konishi study is negligible.
(b) Long-lived birds with ageless ears
The lack of hearing loss in our old barn owls is remarkable,
given that the average life expectancy of barn owls is rather
low. Individuals that survive their first year have an average
life expectancy of 3–4 years [22–26]. It is assumed that the
high mortality rates of first year birds probably arises from
a lack of experience in locating and catching prey [25,26]
and the low abundance of prey [24,26]. Although barn owls
are generally short-lived birds, some may get quite old in
the wild. There are observations of free-living barn owls
reaching an age of between 11 and 18 years, with exceptions
reaching 21 years or even older [22,23,25,45]. Three of our
laboratory-reared barn owls (Bart, Lisa, Weiss) thus exceeded
the average lifespan by far, but were still within the range as
naturally observed. We were able to obtain several threshold
estimates for a wide range of test frequencies from one of
these individuals (Weiss) during its 23 years of life. Over
the whole time period, thresholds both increased and
decreased; on average, thresholds increased by about 10 dB
over 21 years. Thus we did not find shifts in sensitivity that
were
comparable
to
the
typical
mammalian
pattern.
Thresholds in aged mammals are typically elevated by at
least 20–40 dB (see below). Langemann et al. [17] investigated
aspects of presbycusis in another bird species, the European
starling, that has an average lifespan of about 22 months.
Similar to our barn owls, old starlings did not show any evi-
dence for age-related hearing loss. The starlings’ threshold
variation over 11 years was on average less than +4.5 dB
[17]. So far, to our knowledge, European starlings and barn
owls are the only two bird species where auditory sensitivity
in quiet has been investigated in old individuals and both
studies clearly indicate that birds are not subject to age-
related hearing loss.
(c) Ageing birds and ageing mammals
Compared to birds, auditory sensitivity in mammals deterio-
rates significantly with age. Moreover, threshold shifts in
mammals are most prominent at high frequencies [1].
Although most studies in mammals assessed auditory sensi-
tivity with the use of electrophysiological methods such as
auditory brainstem responses (ABR) [2,5], there are a few
studies that investigated ageing in the mammalian auditory
system with behavioural methods [3,4,46,47]. Mills et al. [2]
showed
that
aged
Mongolian
gerbils
(older
than
24
months) experience a shift in ABR thresholds of about
20–35 dB compared to young animals. Behavioural measure-

 thresholds shift of about 20 dB with ageing. Sinnott et al. [47]
found shifts in thresholds for vowel stimuli in Mongolian ger-
bils by about 10 dB per year when testing animals up to the
age of 36 months in a behavioural task. Dum and von
Wedel found shifts in ABR threshold of about 30–40 dB in
guinea pigs aged 24–36 months, as compared to young ani-
mals of six months of age [48]. Studies in rats by Cooper et al.
[49] (ABR measurements) and in mice by Ehret [4,46] (behav-
ioural procedures, NMRI mice) and by Li & Borg [50] (ABR
measurements,
CBA/ca,
C57BL/6 J
mice)
have
shown
thresholds to be elevated by about 15–50 dB in aged individ-
uals. McFadden and colleagues showed that thresholds in
10–15 year old chinchillas were significantly elevated at
several test frequencies, as compared to animals up to 3
years of age [5]. In summary, the loss of auditory sensitivity
in these laboratory mammals was always observed at mul-
tiple test frequencies within the animals’ hearing range and
resembled the pattern typically found in humans suffering
from presbycusis [51], i.e. a greater loss of sensitivity for
high frequencies compared with low frequencies.
One major difference between mammals and birds that
helps to explain this difference in ageing of ears is that
birds are able to restore auditory function after cochlear
damage while mammals are not. In contrast to mammals,
birds and some other vertebrate groups have the capacity
to regenerate lost hair cells in the auditory basilar papilla
[6,9,52]. Although mammals have limited capacity to regen-
erate hair cells in their vestibular sensory epithelia, hair
cells in the organ of Corti cannot be replaced [52]. In order
to understand the mechanisms of regeneration in the avian
basilar papilla, various methods have been used to induce
damage. For example, local application of the ototoxic drug
gentamicin to the round window of the inner ear in the
pigeon led to extensive damage, wiping out hair cells over
most of the basilar papilla. About 48 days later, hair cells
seemed to have fully recovered [7]. Another method used
injected ototoxic substances: chickens treated with ototoxic
substances also regenerated new hair cells [53,54]. Similarly,
in a more recent study by Woolley et al. [8], Bengalese finches
(Lonchura striata domestica) were treated with an ototoxic
substance. The treatment resulted in hair-cell loss especially
in the basal, high-frequency region of the basilar papilla.
Four weeks later, hair cells were almost fully regenerated
[8]. The recovery of hair cells after the application of ototoxic
substances has also been shown in European starlings, can-
aries
(Serinus
canaria)
and
budgerigars
(Melopsittacus
undulates)
[14,15].
Beside
the
application
of
ototoxic
substances, physical methods of inducing acoustic trauma
were also used to study hair-cell regeneration in birds. Acous-
tic stimulation with intense SPLs induces overstimulation and
death of hair cells. Regeneration of hair cells after acoustic
trauma was shown, for example, in quails and in chickens
[10,14,55]. In sharp contrast to mammals, all of those studies
have conclusively shown the ability of birds to regenerate
hair cells after damage and restore auditory function to a
remarkable degree [10,14,52].
The ability for continuous regeneration of the sensory
epithelium is probably the key feature for retaining ‘ageless
ears’. This was previously suggested to prevent age-related
hearing loss, as illustrated by behavioural data from the Euro-
pean starling [17]. Also in the barn owl, a bird with superbly
sensitive hearing and a highly specialized cochlea, we found
no evidence for age-related hearing loss up to an age near the
upper limit of its life expectancy. This suggests that the innate
capacity for hair-cell regeneration protects birds from age-
related hearing loss. As a human being, we can only regard
this capability of birds with great respect (if not with envy).
Evolution has favoured birds to still benefit from regenerative
abilities that were ‘lost’ in the mammalian cochlea. Mammals,
including our own species, commonly suffer from a serious
loss of auditory sensitivity in old age. Humans being about
65 years old will have lost on average more than 30 dB for fre-
quencies of 4 kHz and above [51], whereas aged birds will
probably experience only minimum loss in sensitivity or no
deficit at all. The hope and interesting question remains
whether, someday, our knowledge on preservation of sensi-
tive hearing in birds will provide new treatment options
that could counteract human sensory deficits.
