IMPORTANCE International resuscitation guidelines recommend targeted temperature
management (TTM) at 33°C to 36°C in unconscious patients with out-of-hospital cardiac
arrest for at least 24 hours, but the optimal duration of TTM is uncertain.
OBJECTIVE To determine whether TTM at 33°C for 48 hours results in better neurologic
outcomes compared with currently recommended, standard, 24-hour TTM.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This was an international, investigator-initiated,
blinded-outcome-assessor, parallel, pragmatic, multicenter, randomized clinical superiority
trial in 10 intensive care units (ICUs) at 10 university hospitals in 6 European countries. Three
hundred fifty-five adult, unconscious patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest were
enrolled from February 16, 2013, to June 1, 2016, with final follow-up on December 27, 2016.
INTERVENTIONS Patients were randomized to TTM (33 ± 1°C) for 48 hours (n = 176) or 24
hours (n = 179), followed by gradual rewarming of 0.5°C per hour until reaching 37°C.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was 6-month neurologic outcome,
with a Cerebral Performance Categories (CPC) score of 1 or 2 used to define favorable
outcome. Secondary outcomes included 6-month mortality, including time to death, the
occurrence of adverse events, and intensive care unit resource use.
RESULTS In 355 patients who were randomized (mean age, 60 years; 295 [83%] men), 351
(99%) completed the trial. More patients in the 48-hour group had a favorable outcome, but
this was not statistically significant. Six-month mortality was not different between the
groups. Adverse events were more common in the 48-hour group than in the 24-hour group.
There was no significant difference in the time to mortality (hazard ratio, 0.79; 95% CI,
0.54-1.15; P = .22). The median length of ICU stay (151 vs 117 hours; P < .001), but not hospital
stay (11 vs 12 days; P = .50), was longer in the 48-hour group than in the 24-hour group.

CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In unconscious survivors from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest
admitted to the ICU, targeted temperature management at 33°C for 48 hours did not
significantly improve 6-month neurologic outcome compared with targeted temperature
management at 33°C for 24 hours. However, the study may have had limited power to detect
clinically important differences, and further research may be warranted.

 S
hort- and long-term outcomes in unconscious patients
admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) after out-of-
hospital cardiac arrest are characterized by prognostic
uncertainty and a high risk of death and neurologic deficit.1
To improve the chance of survival and neurologic recovery, in-
ternational guidelines recommend use of targeted tempera-
ture management (TTM), together with urgent coronary an-
giography and percutaneous coronary intervention when
appropriate, and delayed multimodal prognostication before
withdrawal of care.2
The results of the TTM trial (Target Temperature Man-
agement 33°C versus 36°C After Out-of-Hospital Cardiac
Arrest)3 showed that TTM to 36°C had benefits similar to
those of TTM to 33°C, but the optimal duration of cooling is
still under debate.2-4 Current recommendations state that
the patient’
s temperature should be kept at a target of 32°C
to 36°C for at least 24 hours.2,4 This recommended duration
was based on the results of the 2 largest randomized clinical
trials on TTM conducted with adult patients with out-of-
hospital cardiac arrest, which used 24 hours of cooling.3,5
Nevertheless, in some units, longer cooling periods (up to 72
hours) were not uncommon,6,7 and for newborns with
anoxic-asphyxia brain injury, cooling periods of 72 hours
were considered standard practice.8,9 Animal studies have
also suggested a potential benefit of prolonged cooling,10,11
but for adults with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, this
approach is currently supported only by retrospective data
from small cohort studies.12,13
Because of this specific knowledge gap,4 this clinical trial
was designed to compare long-term neurologic outcomes in
patients managed with 48-hour TTM at 33°C compared with
the standard 24-hour duration.
Methods
Study Design
The Time-differentiated Therapeutic Hypothermia trial was an
investigator-initiated, blinded-outcome-assessor, parallel,
pragmatic, multicenter, randomized clinical trial conducted in
10 European ICUs. The study protocol (Supplement 1) was ap-
proved by the ethics committee in each participating center
or country (list of ethical approvals available in Supplement
2). The study was conducted according to the requirements of
the Declaration of Helsinki; written informed consent was ob-
tained from the next of kin or a legal surrogate before random-
ization, and from each patient who regained mental capacity,
according to local ethical approval. An independent data and
safety monitoring committee performed predefined blinded
interim analyses when 175 patients had been included, evalu-
ating only safety issues and mortality at 6 months. Accuracy
of collected study data was monitored by the principal inves-
tigator (see Supplement 2) or a person nominated within the
study group.
Patients
All patients admitted to the ICU after an out-of-hospital car-
diac arrest of presumed cardiac origin were screened for
eligibility, with the inclusion criteria older than 17 years
and younger than 80 years, sustained return of spontaneous
circulation for more than 20 consecutive minutes, and
Glasgow Coma Scale score less than 8.14 Patients with
shockable and nonshockable rhythms were eligible;
patients with unwitnessed asystole were excluded. A full
description of the exclusion criteria is available in Supple-
ment 2. Randomization had to take place within the first 23
hours after a core temperature less than or equal to 34°C
had been reached.
Randomization and Blinding
After screening for eligibility, patients were randomly
assigned in a 1:1 ratio to 1 of the 2 study groups, using a
web-based central randomization procedure provided by
the Department of Clinical Medicine, Aarhus University,
Denmark (Figure 1). Randomization was carried out within
strata defined by study site, age (<60 vs ≥60 years), and ini-
tial rhythm (shockable or not), using blinded randomly per-
muted block sizes of 6, 4, and 2. Medical personnel caring
for the study patients, research staff entering data into the
electronic case report form, and relatives were aware of
group assignments.
Neurologic prognostication and decisions about with-
drawal of treatment were made by medical personnel
independent of the research team. Physicians and health
personnel assessing 6-month functional outcomes and
the statisticians were unaware of the study group assign-
ments. During the analysis phase, the 2 study groups were
identified as group 1 and group 2, and the results were incor-
porated in a final report by the writing group before data
were unblinded.
Intervention
Patients were randomized to TTM at 33°C (±1°C) for 24 or 48
hours. Surface and invasive cooling methods were allowed,
including boluses of intravenous cold fluids for induction of
TTM (4°C). The aim was to reach target temperature as fast
as possible. Temperature was measured in the bladder, rec-
tum, or esophagus, or with intravascular probes according
to local practices. Timing of the 24- or 48-hour duration
started from the first point at which the core temperature
Key Points
Question Does targeted temperature management at 33°C for 48
hours result in better neurologic outcome compared with standard
24-hour targeted temperature management in unconscious
patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest?
Findings In this randomized clinical trial enrolling 355 adults with
out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, there was no significant difference
in favorable neurologic outcome at 6 months for those treated for
48 hours (69%) vs 24 hours (64%) (difference, 5%).
Meaning Prolonged targeted temperature management at 33°C
did not result in better neurologic outcome; however, the study
may have had limited power to detect clinically important
differences, and further research may be warranted.

 was 34°C or lower. At the end of the 24- or 48-hour period,
rewarming was performed at a maximal rate of 0.5°C/h until
a core temperature of 37°C was reached. Sedation was used
in both groups until rewarming was complete. The trial pro-
tocol included recommendations on supportive treatment,
including the use of vasopressors, mechanical ventilation,
and blood pressure targets.
In patients with severe bleeding, life-threatening
arrhythmias, or refractory low cardiac output, cooling could
be prematurely stopped and the temperature increased to
36°C to 37°C by the treating physicians, independent of the
research team. These patients were analyzed in their
assigned treatment group in a modified intention-to-treat
analysis, but excluded from the per-protocol analysis.
Neurologic Prognostication
All centers agreed to provide active treatment until 72
hours after normothermia, with the exception of patients
with brain death or refractory shock with multiple organ
dysfunctions. Patients who remained unconscious
despite cessation of sedation were assessed according to
trial protocol recommendations (Supplement 1) with a com-
bination of neurologic examination, electroencephalogra-
phy, somatosensory-evoked potentials, computed tomogra-
phy, and magnetic resonance imaging of the brain according
to the decision of the attending physicians. Decisions to
withdraw life-supporting therapy were made by a multidis-
ciplinary team according to protocol recommendations and
local practice, and were recorded in the electronic case
report form.
Adverse Events and Hospital Stay
Adverse events data were collected throughout the hospital
stay, including the occurrence of a new cerebral abnormality
(including seizures), hypotension, cardiac arrhythmia,
gastrointestinal feeding intolerance, renal failure, infections
(in particular, pneumonia), and bleeding (including need for
transfusion) (Supplement 1 and 2). Time receiving ventilator
assistance (time to extubation) was collected, as well as
length of stay in the ICU and in the hospital and the use of
medical procedures (ie, tracheostomy, echocardiography,
gastroscopy, and computed tomography scan).
Follow-up and Outcome
All surviving patients were followed up until 6 months after
enrollment. The primary outcome, neurologic outcome at
6 months after the cardiac arrest, was defined by and based
on the Cerebral Performance Categories score: 1, alert,
able to work and lead a normal life; 2, moderate cerebral
disability and sufficient cerebral function for part-time
work; 3, severe cerebral disability, dependent on others, and
impaired brain function; 4, coma and vegetative state;
and 5, dead or certified brain dead. A Cerebral Performance
Categories score of 1 or 2 was considered a favorable neuro-
logic outcome.15,16 Assessors blinded to the treatment allo-
cation performed the assessment during a telephone or
person-to-person interview. The main secondary outcomes
were 6-month mortality and time to death. Cause of death
was reported as multiple organ dysfunction, brain death,
withdrawal of life-supporting treatment, and other or unde-
termined reasons.

OHCA indicates out-of-hospital cardiac arrest; ICU, intensive care unit;
ROSC, return of spontaneous circulation.
a Reasons for not meeting inclusion (eligibility) criteria were as follows:
not cardiac OHCA (n=75), age (n=53), Glasgow Coma Scale score >8 (n=49),
and no stable ROSC (n=14).
bExclusion criteria met were as follows: estimated time from collapse
to ROSC >60 min (n=40), cardiac arrest with presumed noncardiac cause
(eg, trauma, aorta dissection, intracerebral disease, massive bleeding,
hanging, or hypoxemia) (n=63), in-hospital cardiac arrest (n=6), terminal
disease or do-not-resuscitate order (n=15), severe coagulopathy
(anticoagulant therapy, including thrombolysis, was not an exclusion criteria)
(n=8), unwitnessed OHCA with asystole as first rhythm (n=21), time from
cardiac arrest to initiation of cooling >240 min (n=19), neurologic disease with
cognitive impairment (n=8), persistent cardiogenic shock, systolic blood
pressure <80 mm Hg despite vasoactive treatment, or aortic balloon pump
intervention (n=46), suspected or confirmed acute intracerebral bleeding
(n=9), suspected or confirmed acute stroke (n=6), and acute coronary artery
bypass surgery (n=1).
c Other reasons for exclusion were as follows: patient died before enrollment
(n=10), other interventional study precluding co-enrollment (n=5), patients
transferred to other ICU because of bed availability (n=5), and patient
not native to country of treatment, rendering follow-up difficult
or impossible (n=3).
dThe patient lost to follow-up was known to be alive and was included in the
survival analyses, but could not be included in the primary analyses due to lack
of primary outcome data.

 Statistical Analyses
For 80% power (2-sided P = .05) to show an absolute differ-
ence of 15% (50% vs 65%), a sample size of 338 patients was
required. The choice of 15% as detectable difference was
based on the effect sizes observed in the original TTM studies
from 2002 and on observational data.5,17,18 The expected out-
come of 50% was estimated according to the percentage of
patients with good outcome in the 2 randomized studies
from 2002, 49% and 55%, and supported by registry data.19
To account for potential loss to follow-up, sample size was
inflated by 5% to 355 participants. No adjustment was made
to the sample size analysis to account for the preplanned
interim safety analysis. A modified intention-to-treat analysis
(including all randomized patients who initiated the inter-
vention and did not withdraw their consent)20 was under-
taken in accordance with the protocol (Supplement 1) and the
previously published analysis plan21 by an independent stat-
istician blinded to treatment allocation. An additional per-
protocol analysis was also conducted, excluding patients in
whom cooling was terminated earlier than scheduled.
Categorical data were compared with χ2 tests for equal
proportion (or Fisher exact test), t test for normally distrib-
uted data, and Wilcoxon test otherwise. Results are pre-
sented as numbers (percentages), means (SD), and medians
(interquartile range [IQR]), as appropriate. Binomial out-
comes are presented as proportions (95% CIs), with group
comparisons presented as unadjusted differences (95% CIs)
and as both unadjusted and adjusted relative risks (95%
CIs), which were derived from Poisson regression with
robust error variance.22
Unadjusted and adjusted 6-month survival analyses
were performed with Cox proportional hazards regression,
with results reported as hazard ratios. Survival time is pre-
sented with Kaplan-Meier curves and was compared between
groups by using the log-rank test, with proportionality
assumptions verified with Schoenfeld residuals. Resource
usage variables were log transformed, with unadjusted and
adjusted analysis performed by using mixed hierarchic linear
modeling, with results presented as geometric means, ratios
of geometric means, and Hodges-Lehmann differences
between medians, each with 95% CIs. Multivariable analyses
were performed by adjusting for a priori–defined covariates
(trial site, age, sex, initial cardiac arrest rhythm, time to
return of spontaneous circulation, and bystander-initiated
life support), with patients nested within site and site treated
as a random effect. Second subgroup analyses were per-
formed on the following predefined subgroups: age (<60 or
≥60 years), cardiac rhythm (shockable or not shockable),
time to return of spontaneous circulation (<25 or ≥25 min-
utes), bystander-initiated life support (performed or not per-
formed), method of cooling (invasive or noninvasive), time
from return of spontaneous circulation to target temperature
(<240 or ≥240 minutes), out-of-hospital cardiac arrest score
(<20 or ≥20 points),23 and the site with the highest number of
recruited patients compared with the other sites. Subgroup
results are presented as a forest plot, with heterogeneity
among subgroups determined by fitting an interaction
between treatment and subgroup.
Temperatures during the first 24 hours of TTM and from
completion of TTM (after 24 or 48 hours) to normothermia
(37°C) were analyzed with repeated-measures analysis of
variance, with pairwise post hoc comparisons performed by
using t tests. Because multiple comparisons were consid-
ered, in the absence of any post hoc adjustment of the sig-
nificance level, secondary outcomes should be considered
as hypothesis generating and interpreted as exploratory.
Because the number of missing values for primary and sec-
ondary outcomes and for variables needed for the adjusted
analysis was minimal, no imputation was performed.

Results
Patients
Between February 2013 and June 2016, all patients with
out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (n = 907) who were admitted
to a participating ICU were screened; 716 met the inclusion
criteria. Of these patients, 361 had at least 1 exclusion crite-
rion so that 355 patients were randomized, 176 to the
48-hour TTM group and 179 to the 24-hour TTM group. The
population in the modified intention-to-treat primary out-
come analysis included 175 patients in the 48-hour group
and 176 in the 24-hour group (Figure 1). One patient was lost
to follow-up but was known to be alive and therefore
included in the mortality analysis. Baseline characteristics
were comparable between groups (Table 1).
Intervention
The mean body temperature at ICU admission was 35°C
(SD, 1.1°C) in the 48-hour group and 34.9°C (SD, 1.0°C) in the
24-hour group. Invasive cooling with an intravascular cath-
eter was the most common cooling method (n = 218 [62%]),
with no significant differences between groups (Table 2).
Time from return of spontaneous circulation to target tem-
perature was shorter in the 48-hour group than in the
24-hour group (281 [IQR, 217-360] vs 320 [IQR 241-410] min-
utes; P = .01). After achievement of the target temperature
(≤34°C), there were no significant differences in body tem-
perature between groups until 24 hours (mean, 33.0°C [SD,
0.5°C] in the 24-hour group and 33.1°C [SD, 0.5°C] in the
48-hour group; P = .66) (Figure 2). The intervention was
stopped early in 11 patients in the 48-hour group (6%) and 3
patients (2%) in the 24-hour group (Table 2). The rewarming
rate did not differ significantly between the 2 groups (0.4°C
[SD, 0.2°C] per hour in the 24-hour group and 0.3°C [SD,
0.2°C] per hour in the 48-hour group; P = .07) (Table 2). Tem-
peratures were significantly lower in the 48-hour group at 60
hours but not at 72 hours from when the target temperature
was achieved (Table 2). ICU parameters in regard to other
aspects of care were similar between groups during the first
24 hours (eTable 2 in Supplement 2). During the intervention,
the majority of patients were sedated with propofol (n = 305)
and remifentanil (n = 164). Midazolam (n = 46) and fentanyl

Outcomes
Six-month neurologic outcome was available for 351 patients
(Figure 1); 120 of 175 patients in the 48-hour group (69%; 95%
CI, 62%-75%) and 112 of 176 in the 24-hour group (64%; 95%
CI,56%-71%)hadafavorableneurologicoutcome(absolutedif-
ference, 4.9%; 95% CI, −5% to 14.8%; relative risk, 1.08; 95%
CI, 0.93-1.25; P = .33) (Table 3). Similar results were obtained
in the adjusted and the per-protocol analyses (eTable 2 in
Supplement 2). The lack of a significant effect of TTM dura-
tion on neurologic outcome was consistent across all pre-
defined subgroups (eFigure 1 in Supplement 2).
Mortality at 6 months was 27% (95% CI, 21%-34%) in the
48-hour group and 34% (95% CI, 27%-41%) in the 24-hour
group (difference, −6.5%; 95% CI, −16.1% to 3.1%; relative risk,
0.81;95%CI,0.59-1.11;P = .19).Themedianfollow-uptimewas
184 days (IQR, 33-196 days) in the 48-hour group and 181 days
(IQR, 15-193 days) in the 24-hour group (P = .43). There were
no significant differences in time to death overall or in the ad-
justed and per-protocol analyses (Figure 3 and eTable 2 in
Supplement 2). There were no differences in the other pre-
specified primary and secondary outcomes between groups,

 Supplement 2). There were no significant differences in the
rates of pneumonia or bleeding between the groups; how-
ever, severe bleeding was more common in the 24-hour than
in the 48-hour group (4% vs 1%; P = .03).
Resource Use
The median ICU length of stay was longer in the 48-hour than
inthe24-hourgroup(151hours[IQR,127-178hours]vs117hours
[IQR, 99-138 hours]; P < .001), but there was no significant dif-
ference in hospital length of stay (Table 2). There were no sig-
nificant differences between groups in the use of mechanical
assistdevices,tracheostomy,echocardiography,gastroscopy,or
other operative procedures. Four patients in the 48-hour group
had coronary artery bypass grafting compared with none in the
24-hour group (eTable 6 in Supplement 2).
Discussion
In this pragmatic, international, multicenter, randomized
clinical trial, 48-hour TTM at 33°C was compared with stan-
dard 24-hour TTM in comatose patients admitted to the ICU
after an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest of presumed cardiac
origin. There were no significant differences between groups
in the rates of favorable neurologic outcome or survival at
6-month follow-up. Patients who received TTM for 48 hours
had a higher incidence of adverse events and a longer ICU
length of stay. These results were consistent across pre-
defined subgroups and after adjustment for prerandomiza-
tion characteristics. However, the study may have had lim-
ited power to detect clinically important differences.
Current resuscitation guidelines recommend TTM at
33°C to 36°C for at least 24 hours.2,4 Previous studies have
focused on the concept of cooling5,17 and on which core tem-
perature should be targeted,3 but not on duration. The over-
all survival rate and proportion of patients with good neuro-
logic outcome at 6 months were higher than in previous TTM
studies, and higher than anticipated when sample size
calculation5,17 was performed. Although general improve-
ments in out-of-hospital and in-hospital care over time may
partly explain this observation, differences between the cur-
rent study population and those of previous studies may also
be important. For example, the rate of bystander cardiopul-
monary resuscitation and use of automated external defibril-
lators were higher in the current study than in previous ran-
domized clinical trials and observational studies.3,5,17,24
Furthermore, compared with the TTM trial,3 patients in the
current study were younger and more frequently had a
shockable rhythm, as well as slightly shorter times from car-
diac arrest to return of spontaneous circulation. A high per-
centage of patients also had immediate interventional cardiac
procedures (coronary angiography or percutaneous coronary
intervention), factors known to influence outcome after out-
of-hospital cardiac arrest.1 Nevertheless, the current study
included comatose patients after an anoxic injury, which is
the population in whom TTM appeared to be effective in pre-
vious trials,3,5,17 supporting that findings in the current study
are likely to be generalizable.
Duration of TTM in the prolonged-cooling group was set
to 48 hours. There is no scientific evidence that specifically
supports48hoursorotherdurationslongerthan24hours.The
48-hour period was selected to balance a clear augmentation
of “cooling dose” against an expected prolonged ICU stay and
the risk of more adverse events.
In this study, adverse event rates may appear high but are
comparable to those of previous trials on TTM at 33°C.3,5
More patients were rewarmed to 36°C before conclusion of
the intervention in the 48-hour group compared with the
24-hour group, but overall rewarming rates and causes were
similar to those of a previous study.3 Furthermore, the higher
rate of rewarming and adverse effects was expected, given
the longer treatment. Although 48-hour TTM was associated
with slightly more adverse events than 24-hour TTM, most of
them were mild and did not appear to affect neurologic out-
come. In neonates with hypoxic-ischemic brain injury, TTM
at 33°C for 72 hours is standard practice8,9; prolonged cooling
for 120 hours in one trial resulted in significant harm.8 Unlike
the findings of one observational study,13 the 48-hour group
had no increased risk of severe arrhythmias or pneumonia,
which are known complications with TTM.25,26
This study has several strengths. It is a multicenter study
and has clear recommendations for interventions. Both inva-
sive and noninvasive cooling methods were allowed, which
represents current management and thus increases the gen-
eralizability of the findings. Because TTM affects neurologic
prognostication and some patients regain consciousness long
after the initial anoxic injury, a multimodal prognostication
approach was used to avoid self-fulfilling outcome with with-
drawing of life-sustaining treatment.27 Finally, the initial
intensive care management was similar between groups. The
majority of patients underwent electroencephalography,
somatosensory-evoked potential, or cerebral computed
tomography scan as part of this multimodal approach, with
no significant differences between groups.
Limitations
This study also has several limitations. Sample size calcula-
tion using a 15% absolute difference in the primary outcome
may have increased the risk of a type II error. The protocol
was, however, written before the publication of the TTM
study.3 The assumed treatment effect was comparable to that
in the original TTM trials5,17 and also appeared supported by
observational data.5,8,18,28 Recent randomized clinical trials
on the effect of TTM in adults after status epilepticus, in chil-
dren after cardiac arrest, and in neonates after asphyxia used
similar effect sizes, with an assumed improvement of 10% to
15% in the intervention group (at 33°C) compared with
controls.8,28,29 Although this study did not find a statistically
significant difference between treatment groups, the 95% CIs
around the difference (−5% to 14.8%) indicate that a true dif-
ference between groups is unlikely to lie outside this range.
The 5% higher rate of 6-month favorable neurologic outcome
in the prolonged-cooling group could represent a clinically
meaningful difference. A trial to confirm or reject such a 5%
absolute difference in good neurologic outcome between
groups would, according to the unadjusted differences,

 require a much larger study with approximately 3000
patients. In addition, as in other studies,3,23 it was not pos-
sible to blind the ICU staff to the treatment group. The
6-month evaluation was, however, carried out by research
personnel from outside the ICU. In most of the countries par-
ticipating in the trial, ethical requirements did not allow allo-
cation to the study before consent from a legal surrogate.
This may have introduced bias toward exclusion of some
patients otherwise eligible on admission to the ICU. The pres-
ence or absence of brain stem reflexes on admission to the
ICU was not collected, and therefore imbalances between
treatment groups in regard to these important components
cannot be excluded. Finally, as in other studies of patients
with cardiac arrest, good neurologic outcome was defined as
a Cerebral Performance Categories score of 1 or 2, which may
be considered a rather crude measure of neurologic outcome.
Therefore, this study cannot provide definitive conclusions
about the potential effects of the studied intervention on
other patient outcomes, such as quality of life or more
refined measures of cognitive function.
Conclusions
In unconscious survivors from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest
who were admitted to the ICU, TTM for 48 hours did not sig-
nificantly improve 6-month neurologic outcome compared
with TTM for 24 hours. However, the study may have had lim-
ited power to detect clinically important differences, and fur-
ther research may be warranted.
