ABSTRACT: Collectively, lymphoid neoplasms are the fourth most common cancer
and the sixth leading cause of cancer death in the United States. The authors provide
contemporary lymphoid neoplasm statistics by subtype based on the 2008 World
Health Organization classifications, including the most current US incidence and sur-
vival data. Presented for the first time are estimates of the total numbers of US lym-
phoid neoplasm cases by subtype as well as a detailed evaluation of incidence and
survival statistics. In 2016, 136,960 new lymphoid neoplasms are expected. Overall
lymphoma incidence rates have declined in recent years, but trends vary by subtype.
Precursor lymphoid neoplasm incidence rates increased from 2001 to 2012, particu-
larly for B-cell neoplasms. Among the mature lymphoid neoplasms, the fastest
increase was for plasma cell neoplasms. Rates also increased for mantle cell lympho-
ma (males), marginal zone lymphoma, hairy cell leukemia, and mycosis fungoides.
Like incidence, survival for both mature T-cell lymphomas and mature B-cell lympho-
mas varied by subtype and by race. Patients with peripheral T-cell lymphomas had
among the worst 5-year relative survival (36%-56%, depending on race/sex), while
those with mycosis fungoides had among the best survival (79%-92%). For B-cell lym-
phomas, 5-year survival ranged from 83% to 91% for patients with marginal zone lym-
phoma and from 78% to 92% for those with hairy cell leukemia; but the rates were as
low as 47% to 63% for patients with Burkitt lymphoma and 44% to 48% for those with
plasma cell neoplasms. In general, black men had the lowest survival across lym-
phoid malignancy subtypes. These contemporary incidence and survival statistics are
useful for developing management strategies for these cancers and can offer clues
regarding their etiology. CA Cancer J Clin 2016;66:443-459. V

Introduction
Historical reporting of hematologic malignancy statistics grouped them into 5
major categories: Hodgkin lymphoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), myelo-
ma, and acute and chronic leukemias. However, biologic, diagnostic, and thera-
peutic advances in hematologic malignancies have brought about many changes in
how these cancers are classified, diagnosed, and treated.1–3 As a result, these his-
torical groupings reflect neither current understanding of pathogenesis nor current
clinical practice. While maintaining the original groupings can be useful for his-
torical comparisons, there is a clear need for contemporary statistics that reflect the
current state of knowledge about these diseases.
Contemporary, comprehensive, population-based information about the under-
lying patterns of incidence and survival of clinically meaningful subtypes of lym-
phoid malignancies in the United States remains limited. Previous articles
reported on either incidence or survival statistics for specific age or race groups,
earlier time periods, for all NHL combined, or for a few specific lymphoid neo-
plasm subtypes.4–9 A recent report from the United Kingdom10 provided an

 updated overview of national lymphoid malignancy inci-
dence, survival, and prevalence statistics for that country;
but an updated, comprehensive review for the United States
has not been done. Two US-based articles11,12 presented
US lymphoma incidence patterns by World Health Orga-
nization (WHO) subtype using Surveillance, Epidemiolo-
gy, and End Results (SEER) data but did not include
survival data. A report from the National Cancer Data Base
described 5-year survival for WHO subtypes, but this was
not in a population-based sample.13
In this article, we augment the existing literature by pre-
senting estimated counts of new lymphoid neoplasm cases
by WHO subtype for 2016 as well as updating lymphoid
neoplasm incidence rates using US data that are more com-
prehensive than those used in previous publications. We
examine these rates overall and by age, race, and sex where
sample size allows. In addition, we present the most com-
prehensive and updated US survival statistics for lymphoid
neoplasms by race and sex.
Methods
Study Data
Incidence
Incidence data from 1995 onward were compiled by the
North American Association of Central Cancer Registries
(NAACCR) from cancer registries that participate in the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention National Pro-
gram of Cancer Registries or the SEER program. For this
analysis, we used incidence data from 45 US states and the
District of Columbia, representing 95% of the US popula-
tion, to provide incidence rates during 2011 through 2012
by lymphoma subtype, sex, race/ethnicity, and age at diag-
nosis (in 5-year age groups).14 Data from Arkansas, Kansas,
Minnesota, Nevada, and Vermont were not included,
because those states did not submit data, failed to meet
NAACCR high-quality standards for 1 or more years dur-
ing 2011 through 2012, or did not consent to participate in
this study. We analyzed trends in incidence rates from
2001 through 2012, because 2001 was the beginning of a
new era in lymphoid neoplasm classification with the publi-
cation of the WHO classification system.15 For analyses of
incidence trends, we excluded 4 additional states (Missis-
sippi, New Hampshire, Tennessee, and Virginia) and the
District of Columbia, because data were not available for 1
or more years during 2001 through 2012. Trend analyses
were also limited to first primary diagnoses (in contrast to
rates, rate ratios, and estimated new cases that included all
cases). Patients who were reported only from a nursing
home/convalescent center, autopsy, or death certificate
were excluded.
Survival
Data from the 18 SEER registries (Atlanta, Connecticut,
Detroit, Hawaii, Iowa, New Mexico, San Francisco-
Oakland, Seattle-Puget Sound, Utah, Los Angeles, San
Jose-Monterey, Rural Georgia, Alaska Native Tumor Reg-
istry, Greater California, Kentucky, Louisiana, New Jersey,
and Greater Georgia), covering approximately 28% of the
US population, were used to provide estimates of relative
survival for major subtypes.16 Relative survival was calculat-
ed using nationwide population life tables stratified by age,
sex, calendar time, and, where applicable, race. Two-year
relative survival rates were based on patients who were
diagnosed during 2007 to 2011, 5-year survival rates were
based on diagnoses from 2005 to 2011, and 10-year survival
rates were based on diagnoses from 2001 to 2011; all
patients were followed through 2012.
Lymphoid neoplasm subtypes
Lymphoid malignancy subtypes were defined using the
2008 WHO classification scheme.17 The WHO classifica-
tion system is currently considered the “gold standard” for
classifying all hematopoietic neoplasms.15 That classifica-
tion scheme takes into account many aspects of the disease,
including morphology, immunophenotype, and cytogenetic
and molecular characteristics. Although some updates have
been made, and a new WHO manual was released in
2016,18,19 the available surveillance data are through 2012
and do not reflect these updates. The new entities have not
yet been captured by the registries, and the ability to recode
existing data to these new descriptors will be limited
because many require additional molecular or clinical data.
Thus, the frequency of these new entities will be unclear
until they become adopted by hematopathologists and rou-
tinely distinguished in clinical practice. However, these
changes to the 2008 classification are relatively small and
would not be expected to change our conclusions. The
WHO classification has been adopted worldwide, and
the terminology is incorporated into the third edition of the
International Classification of Diseases for Oncology (ICD-
O).20 ICD-O codes for each subtype are listed in Table 1.
Statistical Analyses
All incidence rates were age-standardized to the 2000 US
standard population and expressed per 100,000 people, as
calculated using the National Cancer Institute’s SEER*Stat
software package (version 8.2.1; National Cancer Institute,
Bethesda, MD).21 We examined trends in lymphoid neo-
plasm incidence rates from 2001 to 2012 by subtype and
sex using Joinpoint software (version 4.2.0.2; National
Cancer Institute). This method involves fitting a series of
joined straight lines on a logarithmic scale to the trends in
annual rates with each junction or “joinpoint” denoting a
statistically significant change in trend.22 The direction and

 magnitude of the resulting trends over the 2001 to 2012
period are described as the annual percent change (APC).
If the program detects no change in trend for a given sub-
type between 2001 and 2012, then only a single APC will
be given. If the program detects multiple trends, then the
magnitude, direction, and years that the trend held con-
stant will be listed separately. In describing trends, the
terms increase and decrease were used when the APC was
statistically significant; otherwise, the term stable was used.
Incidence rate trends were adjusted for delays in reporting
to account for the additional time required for registration
of some cases. Delay adjustment has the largest effect on
the most recent years of data for cancers that are frequently
diagnosed in outpatient settings and provides a more accu-
rate portrayal of the cancer burden in the most recent time
period.23 Sex-specific and site-specific (Hodgkin lympho-
ma, NHL, and myeloma) delay-adjustment ratios from the
SEER 18 areas were applied to the NAACCR data by year
of diagnosis.24
Projected New Cases in 2016
The most recent year for which incidence data are available
lags 2 to 4 years behind the current year because of the time
required for data collection, compilation, quality control,
and dissemination. Therefore, the American Cancer Socie-
ty projects the numbers of new cancer cases in the United
States in the current year to provide an estimate of the con-
temporary cancer burden for a number of cancer sites.25
These estimates were produced using a 3-step spatiotempo-
ral model based on high-quality incidence data from 49
states and the District of Columbia, representing approxi-
mately 94% population coverage (data were lacking for all
years for Minnesota and for some years for other states).
Further details about the case projection methodology are
described in detail elsewhere.26
In this report, we estimate the total number of lymphoid
malignancies expected to occur in the United States in
2016 by summing previously published new case estimates
of Hodgkin lymphoma, NHL, myeloma, acute lymphocytic
leukemia, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia.25 Estimated
cases for each lymphoid neoplasm subtype were then calcu-
lated by applying the proportion of cases of each subtype
diagnosed during 2011 through 2012 from the NAACCR
data to the overall 2016 lymphoid neoplasm estimate for
the United States.
Selected Findings
Estimated Cases in 2016
In 2016, 136,960 lymphoid neoplasms are expected to be
newly diagnosed in the United States (Table 1). Hodgkin
lymphomas make up 6% of the total, and most are classical
Hodgkin lymphoma. Of the 4 classical Hodgkin lymphoma
subtypes, nodular sclerosis classical Hodgkin lymphoma is
the most common (n 5 4280 cases expected); followed by
classical Hodgkin lymphoma, not otherwise specified
(NOS) (n 5 2290); and mixed-cellularity/lymphocyte-
depleted classical Hodgkin lymphoma (n 5 1060). Among
NHL neoplasms (n 5 125,850), defined here as any B-cell
or T-cell/natural killer (NK)-cell neoplasm other than
Hodgkin
lymphoma,
diffuse
large
B-cell
lymphoma
(DLBCL, n 5 27,650) is the most common subtype.
DLBCL comprises about one-quarter of the total mature
NHL neoplasms (Fig. 1). Although there are 9 specified
types of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma in the 2008 WHO
classification scheme, most diffuse large B-cell lymphomas
are still classified as diffuse large B-cell lymphoma NOS (n
5 25,380). The most common type of specified diffuse
large B-cell lymphoma is primary diffuse large B-cell lym-
phoma of the central nervous system (n 5 1100); followed
by primary cutaneous diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, leg
type (n 5 400); and primary mediastinal (thymic) large
B-cell lymphoma (n 5 240). Plasma cell neoplasms are pri-
marily multiple myeloma (93%), but 1250 (5%) are

 expected to be solitary plasmacytoma of bone, and 450
(2%) are expected to be extraosseous plasmacytoma. Other
major B-cell neoplasm subtypes include chronic lymphocyt-
ic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (n 5 20,980),
follicular lymphoma (n 5 13,960), and marginal zone lym-
phoma (n 5 7460). Among marginal zone lymphomas,
60% are extranodal (n 5 4450), 32% are nodal (n 5 2370),
and 9% are splenic (n 5 640). Rarer B-cell subtypes include
hairy cell leukemia (n 5 1100) and hairy cell leukemia vari-
ant (n 5 810) as well as the extremely rare heavy-chain dis-
eases.
About
one-half
(55%)
of
the
mature
T-cell
lymphomas are peripheral T-cell lymphomas (n 5 3950).
Differences in Age, Sex, and Race
by Lymphoma Subtype
Age
As with most cancers, lymphoid neoplasms are more com-
mon in older individuals. Just over one-half (54%) of all
lymphoid neoplasms are diagnosed in individuals aged 65
years and older, but age distribution varies by subtype. For
example, the majority (71%) of lymphoplasmacytic lym-
phomas/Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia diagnoses occur
in individuals aged �65 years, but only 18% of Hodgkin
lymphomas do. Unlike many other types of cancer, lym-
phoid neoplasms are also among the most common child-
hood cancers. Approximately two-thirds of childhood
cancers are lymphoid neoplasms.27
Age-specific incidence rates for the major lymphoid neo-
plasm subtypes are displayed in Figure 2. Figure 2a shows
that the bimodal age distribution often described for Hodg-
kin lymphoma is largely driven by subtype differences, with
nodular sclerosis classical Hodgkin lymphoma the most
common type before age 55 years and classical Hodgkin
lymphoma NOS the more common subtype among older
adults (ages 70 years and older). Classical Hodgkin
lymphoma

predominant Hodgkin lymphoma to be associated with
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV).28 Therefore, it is no surprise
that the age incidence pattern previously reported for
EBV-associated lymphomas29—a small peak in incidence
in adolescents/young adults and a second, larger peak in
older adults—is observed for 2 subtypes of classical Hodg-
kin lymphoma (NOS and mixed-cellularity classical Hodg-
kin lymphoma) (see Fig. 2a).
Age-specific incidence rates for precursor lymphoid
neoplasms are illustrated in Figure 2b. Precursor B-cell
lymphoblastic leukemias/lymphomas are the most com-
mon lymphoid neoplasms diagnosed among children ages
0 to 14 years, although there is a second, smaller inci-
dence peak between ages 50 and 70 years (Fig. 2b). Pre-
cursor T-cell lymphomas are found almost exclusively in
children.
In contrast to cancers in adults, a relatively small propor-
tion of childhood cancers have known preventable causes;
but some nongenetic risk factors have been identified, par-
ticularly for hematologic malignancies.27,29–31 There is evi-
dence that childhood acute lymphocytic leukemia may arise
from genetic or in utero exposures.27 Down syndrome is a
strong risk factor for acute lymphocytic leukemia, and other
genetic disorders are associated with this cancer as well. In
addition to genetic susceptibility, high birth weight and
childhood immune response may contribute to the risk of
acute lymphocytic leukemia.32 Genetic susceptibility may
also play a role in adult acute lymphocytic leukemia,33,34
but other nongenetic factors have been suggested for adult
acute lymphocytic leukemia as well, such as obesity35 and

 occupational exposures like working in the leather or textile
industries.32
Figure 2c shows age incidence curves for the mature B-cell
lymphoid neoplasms. Diagnoses of plasma cell neoplasms and
chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma
rarely occur before age 45 years, and the rates increase rapidly
until age 70 years, with a slightly steeper slope for plasma cell
neoplasms than for chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lym-
phocytic lymphoma. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small
lymphocytic lymphoma is interesting, because there is strong
evidence for a heritable component36–38 despite the finding
that the incidence does not pick up until older ages. It may be
that a combination of both genetic and nongenetic factors
confers the strongest risk for this cancer, because several non-
genetic factors (such as chemical exposures like Agent Orange,
an herbicide used during the Vietnam War39) have also been
associated with an increased risk of this cancer.40 As with
many hematologic cancers, the etiology of plasma cell neo-
plasms remains poorly understood. However, some occupa-
tional, chemical, and energy balance exposures among adults

 have been suggested, and these factors may help explain the
predominance of incidence in older individuals.41,42
Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma is much more common in
adults than children; rates increase dramatically by age 50
years (Fig. 2c). Research supports a multifactorial and com-
plex etiology for these cancers,43,44 and risk factors may be
different for children and adults. Suspected risk factors for
adult diffuse large B-cell lymphoma include B-cell–
activating autoimmune diseases, hepatitis C virus seroposi-
tivity, farming, and higher young-adult body mass index.
Less is known about risk factors for pediatric diffuse large
B-cell lymphomas, but insights into the biology of these
cancers suggest that they are more molecularly heteroge-
neous than adult diffuse large B-cell lymphomas.45
Although Burkitt lymphoma is relatively rare in the
United States, it is one of the most common types of child-
hood lymphoma, particularly among boys. It has a bimodal
distribution age distribution with a second peak in older
adulthood. Sporadic Burkitt lymphoma, the type most com-
monly found in the United States, is not well understood. A
European registry study from the Netherlands found differ-
ences in tumor characteristics between children and adult
patients with Burkitt lymphoma, suggesting heterogeneity
between childhood and adult Burkitt lymphoma.46
Both follicular lymphoma and marginal zone lymphoma
increase in incidence from about age 30 to age 70 years.
Interestingly, these are both subtypes in which there is not
a male dominance in rates, unlike most types of lymphoid
neoplasms. Risk factors for both subtypes include autoim-
mune conditions like Sjogren syndrome, which has a simi-
lar age of onset (ages 40-60 years) and is diagnosed
primarily in women. Other suspected risk factors for follic-
ular lymphoma include cigarette smoke (in women) and
environmental exposures, such as benzene or solvents.47
Other than autoimmune disorders, the only putative risk
factors for marginal zone lymphoma are infectious (eg, Hel-
icobacter pylori) or environmental/chemical (eg, hair dye
among women).48
Age incidence patterns of mature T-cell lymphomas are
illustrated in Figure 2d. Diagnoses of mycosis fungoides
begin in adolescence and peak by age 60 years, whereas
peripheral T-cell lymphomas are diagnosed as early as child-
hood, and rates continue to increase until about age 70 years.
Different risk factor patterns may explain these differences.
Peripheral T-cell lymphoma may be more strongly related to
immune perturbation,3 while mycosis fungoides may be
more strongly associated with lifestyle factors, such as body
size.49
Sex
Incidence rates and rate ratios (IRRs) by sex and race/eth-
nicity for selected lymphoma subtypes are described in
Table 2. During 2011 and 2012, the overall incidence rates
of lymphoid neoplasms were 51% higher in males than in
females, and most subtypes showed excess risk for males,
with the greatest excess risk observed for mantle cell lym-
phoma (IRR, 3.07), Burkitt lymphoma (IRR, 2.79), and
hairy cell leukemia (IRR, 2.77). Reasons for higher rates in
males for these subtypes are unclear, but occupational expo-
sures, such as farm work and industrial or engineering work,
may play a role in sex differences.50,51 For Burkitt lympho-
ma, human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodefi-
ciency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) may also play a role in the
sex disparity in rates, because HIV/AIDS is a strong risk
factor for immunodeficiency-associated Burkitt lymphoma,
and HIV/AIDS rates are more than 4 times higher in males
than in females.52 Other factors also must contribute to the
sex disparity, because Burkitt lymphoma is more common
in young boys than in girls.53 Only a few NHL subtypes
show little sex differences, most prominently marginal zone
lymphomas (IRR, 1.05) and follicular lymphomas (IRR,
1.18). It may be that some risk factors for marginal zone
lymphoma and follicular lymphoma are specific to (or stron-
ger in) women and, thus, rates among women for these lym-
phoid neoplasm subtypes are higher than the rates for other
lymphoid neoplasm subtypes (and more similar to the rates
among men). For example, autoimmune disease, particularly
B-cell–activating autoimmune disease, is a stronger risk fac-
tor for marginal zone lymphoma than for other lymphoid
neoplasms,3,48 and these conditions are more common in
women than in men.54 Interestingly, although there was no
difference by sex in the rates of nodular sclerosis classical
Hodgkin lymphoma, mixed cellularity classical Hodgkin
lymphoma was twice as common in males. Mixed cellularity
classical Hodgkin lymphoma, like Burkitt lymphoma, is
commonly associated with EBV,29 and this might help
explain this difference, because studies of Hodgkin lympho-
ma tumors produced evidence that EBV was twice as com-
mon in tumors from men compared with women.29 Further
research into the biologic and etiologic explanations for all
of these differences by subtype is needed.
Race
Table 2 also provides incidence rates for selected lymphoma
subtypes for 4 major racial/ethnic groups. Non-Hispanic
whites have the highest overall lymphoma incidence rate.
Compared with non-Hispanic whites, overall lymphoma
incidence rates were slightly (4%) lower among non-
Hispanic blacks, 14% lower among Hispanics, and 42%
lower among Asians/Pacific Islanders; however, there was
considerable variation by subtype (Table 2). Burkitt lym-
phoma is of interest, because a subtype of this cancer (called
endemic Burkitt lymphoma) was first diagnosed in African
children in the late 1950s6 and is the most common child-
hood malignancy in equatorial Africa. However in the
United States, Burkitt lymphoma is slightly less common

 in blacks than in other race groups (Table 2). In general,
incidence rates for most B-cell lymphomas were 19% to
64% lower among blacks than among whites, but plasma
cell neoplasm rates were the opposite. Plasma cell neo-
plasms were twice as common in black individuals com-
pared with white individuals (IRR, 2.26) and Asians/
Pacific Islanders had the lowest risk (IRR, 0.63). In part,
obesity
may
explain
these
differences,
because
non-
Hispanic blacks have the highest age-adjusted rates of obe-
sity (47.8%), followed by non-Hispanic whites (32.6%),
and then Asians (10.8%).55 There is also research sugges-
ting that other differences between non-Hispanic blacks
and non-Hispanic whites may play a role in the disparity in
myeloma incidence, including genetic factors (specifically
for human leukocyte antigens) and a differential response
to immune challenges.56 T-cell lymphomas are also more
common among black individuals compared with white
individuals, ranging from an IRR of 1.49 for peripheral T-
cell lymphoma to an IRR of 1.78 for mycosis fungoides.
Specific subtypes of peripheral T-cell lymphoma are more
common in Asia than in Western countries (adult T-cell
leukemia/lymphoma and extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma/
leukemia), and a recent report found that these subtypes are
also more common in US Asian/Pacific populations;9
although, overall rates of peripheral T-cell lymphoma are
slightly higher among non-Hispanic whites, as seen in
Table 2.
Compared with non-Hispanic whites, Hispanics had
lower incidence rates for most lymphoma subtypes; howev-
er, Hispanics had the highest incidence rates for precursor
B-cell lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma, which occurs
primarily in children. Higher rates of this cancer in
Hispanics have been previously observed in studies of pedi-
atric cancers in the United States57 and in other coun-
tries.58,59 Future studies are needed to assess the relative
contribution of genetic and environmental factors, includ-
ing infections, to this disparity. Asians/Pacific Islanders
had the lowest incidence rates for most lymphoma sub-
types, with the exception of the rare subtypes of peripheral
T-cell lymphoma noted previously.
Temporal Trends in Incidence
Recent trends in incidence rates for the major lymphoid
neoplasm subtypes by sex are summarized in Table 3. Over-
all lymphoma incidence rates have declined slightly (0.3%
per year) since 2001 in females and since 2004 in males
(Table 3). Previously, lymphoma incidence rates increased
steadily during the 1970s and 1980s, leveled off in the
1990s, and began a slight decline by the end of the
decade.60 This drop has been attributed to a decrease in
AIDS incidence,61 but a closer look by Shiels et al12
showed that this decline was independent of HIV and may
in part reflect coding changes in 2001, when the WHO
classification system was first published.
Trends for specific lymphoid neoplasm subtypes over the
12-year period from 2001 through 2012 are described in
Table 3 and shown in Figure 3. Precursor lymphoid neo-
plasm incidence rates increased from 2001 to 2012, particu-
larly for B-cell neoplasms. Reasons for the continued, sharp
increase in precursor B-cell lymphoblastic leukemia/lym-
phoma are not known, but changes in some environmental
factors or improved treatment for conditions that were pre-
viously fatal for children have been suggested. Among
mature lymphoid neoplasms, the fastest increase was for

 plasma cell neoplasms. Trends in increasing body size in
part may explain this increase, because obesity was steadily
increasing over this time period55 and is a risk factor for
plasma cell neoplasms.62
Declines were noted for several subtypes, including fol-
licular lymphoma, peripheral T-cell lymphoma, and chron-
ic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma.

 leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma, likely reflect a
change in the diagnostic criteria in 2008.63,64 Classification
changes and improved diagnostic tools have also been sug-
gested as the explanation for increases in both marginal
zone lymphoma and mantle cell lymphoma.11 For marginal
zone lymphoma, large, but nonsignificant, rate increases
were seen in both sexes from 2000 to 2003, followed by
more moderate rate increases. In analyses of trends by HIV
status, Shiels et al12 found that excluding HIV-infected
patients with NHL did not impact the observed trends for
this subtype, and it is possible that the initial increase in
incidence for marginal zone lymphoma reflects ICD-O
coding changes for this cancer subtype. Rates of mantle cell
lymphoma, however, have been increasing since 2001,
which may reflect a true increase in incidence. Declines in
incidence rates of follicular lymphoma and peripheral T-
cell lymphoma may reflect declines in smoking rates65 over
this time period, as a positive association with these 2 lym-
phoid neoplasm subtypes has been noted despite a lack of
association with NHL overall.3,47,66–68
Relative Survival by Race and Sex
The 2-year, 5-year, and 10-year relative survival for patients
by lymphoid neoplasm subtype and race are illustrated in
Figures 4 through 7. There is tremendous variability in
prognosis by subtype. Mature T-cell lymphomas (Fig. 4)
are particularly interesting, because peripheral T-cell lym-
phoma and mycosis fungoides are at opposite extremes in
terms of survival—peripheral T-cell lymphoma was among
the subtypes with the worst survival (36%-56% 5-year sur-
vival, depending on race/sex), while mycosis fungoides was
among those with the best survival (79%-92% 5-year sur-
vival). Five-year survival for patients with mature B-cell
lymphomas ranged from 83% to 91% for marginal zone
lymphoma and from 78% to 92% for hairy cell leukemia to
as low as 47% to 63% for Burkitt lymphoma and 44% to
48% for plasma cell neoplasms (Fig. 5). Notably, 2-year
survival was approximately 70% for patients with plasma
cell neoplasms of all race groups. Although the observed
difference between 2-year, 5-year, and 10-year survival for
plasma cell neoplams partly reflects short-term versus long-
term survival, it also may reflect in part the many new ther-
apies that have emerged in recent years.69 Two-year surviv-
al was quite high for other lymphoid neoplasm subtypes,
like marginal zone lymphoma (range, 89%-95%) and follic-
ular lymphoma (range, 88%-93%), but hovered around
one-half to two-thirds for Burkitt lymphoma, 49%-68%
and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, 63-68%.
Blacks (particularly males) had lower survival than whites
for many lymphoid neoplasm subtypes. For example, sur-
vival for Hodgkin lymphoma (Fig. 7) was lower for black
males than for any other race/sex group. Patients who had
classical Hodgkin lymphoma, NOS, had the lowest survival
of any Hodgkin lymphoma subtype examined, particularly
for black men (77% 2-year survival, 69% 5-year survival,
55% 10-year survival).
Other subtypes with notable survival differences by race
include mycosis fungoides, peripheral T-cell lymphoma,
Burkitt lymphoma, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia/
small lymphocytic lymphoma. Among the T-cell lympho-
mas, peripheral T-cell lymphoma survival was poor for all
race/sex groups, but particularly for black men and women,

through 2012.

 even at 2 years postdiagnosis (Fig. 4). In contrast, mycosis
fungoides survival was generally much higher, but both 5-
year and 10-year survival were lowest among black men and
women (Fig. 4). Unlike some other lymphoid neoplasm
subtypes, rates of mycosis fungoides are increasing, so the
observed disparities may become an even larger problem
over time. At the extreme, 10-year relative survival for
chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lympho-
ma is as much as 20% lower for black patients compared
with white patients (Fig. 5). Previous research has shown
that these survival differences by race for chronic lympho-
cytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma are observed
even with similar treatment regimens.70 Further research is
needed to understand the biologic and socioeconomic
underpinnings that may explain these disparities.
Interestingly, some of the subtypes with the overall low-
est relative survival (mantle cell lymphomas and plasma cell
neoplasms) had similar relative survival among black and
white patients. This is consistent with findings from a
Southwest Oncology Group71 study in which no race dif-
ferences were observed in myeloma survival even when
stage and other prognostic factors were taken into account.
Furthermore, a study of patient data from 21 comprehen-
sive cancer centers56 reported no race differences in myelo-
ma treatment regimen but found that the risk of death was
actually greater for whites than for blacks.
Limitations
Although the number of expected cases in 2016 provides a
reasonably accurate portrayal of the contemporary cancer
burden of lymphoid neoplasms, the data on specific sub-
types should be interpreted with caution. Some WHO
lymphoid neoplasm subtypes are extremely rare, making
estimation of rates and expected cases less robust. Because
lymphoid malignancies are extremely complex and hetero-
geneous, there have been many coding changes for these
cancers over time, and these changes may impact trends for
some subtypes (as discussed above). Furthermore, despite
the detailed categorization developed by the WHO, there
also are non-negligible numbers of lymphoid malignancies
recorded in cancer registries as unclassified, either overall or
within subtypes (eg, classic Hodgkin lymphoma, NOS).
Not only are these heterogeneous, unclassified lymphomas
difficult to study, but the defined subtypes to which these
cases truly belong are underestimated. For some lymphoid
malignancies, these cases comprise a substantial proportion
of total cases and could distort the incidence and survival of
classified cases.
Conclusions
This report presents the latest available incidence and sur-
vival statistics for lymphoid neoplasm subtypes separately
by age, sex, and race. This is the first time that there have
been projected case estimates for lymphoid neoplasm sub-
types, including rare lymphomas and a detailed, compre-
hensive look at survival by WHO lymphoid neoplasm
subtypes. It is clear that there are stark differences in inci-
dence and survival patterns by subtype that vary sometimes
by sex and often by race. Most types of lymphoid neoplasms
are more common in men, but nodular sclerosis classical
Hodgkin lymphoma and some types of NHL are approxi-
mately equally common in women. Non-Hispanic whites
have higher incidence rates of most types of lymphoid

 neoplasms, although plasma cell neoplasms and T-cell lym-
phomas are twice as common in non-Hispanic blacks.
Although incidence rates of lymphoid neoplasms are gener-
ally higher among whites, black men tend to have poorer
survival. These differences are not explained by our current,
limited understanding of the etiology of these cancers, and
future research into the reasons for these disparities is need-
ed. These data underscore the importance of taking into
account differences in lymphoid neoplasm subtypes when
developing management strategies for these cancers and
may also offer clues about their etiology. �
