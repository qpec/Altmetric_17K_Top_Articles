Clinical Trials Study
 (according to recommended guidelines of the University 
of Wisconsin Atherosclerosis Imaging Research Program 
Core Laboratory). The subjects then drank an energy 
beverage (EB), a 24-oz can of Monster Energy, and the 
above was repeated at 90 min after consumption. The 
relative FMD (%) was calculated as the ratio between 
the average post-cuff release and the baseline diameter
. 
Each image was checked for quality control, and each 
artery diameter was measured from the media to media 
points by two experts, 3 measurements at the QRS 
complex, repeated on 3 separate beats, and then all were 
averaged.
RESULTS
Subjects characteristics averages (given with standard 
deviations) include: Age 24.5 ± 1.5 years, sex 9 male 
and 2 female, weight 71.0 ± 9.1 kg, height 176.4 ± 
6.0 cm, BMI 22.8 ± 2.7 kg/m
2. The hemodynamics 
were as follows, BL vs EB group respectively (mean ± 
SD): Heart rate 65.2 ± 11.3 vs 68.2 ± 11.8 beats per 
minute, systolic blood pressure 114.0 ± 10.4 mmHg vs 
114.1 ± 10.4 mmHg, diastolic blood pressure 68.8 ± 9.3 
mmHg vs 70.6 ± 7.1 mmHg; all were not significantly 
different. However after drinking the EB, a significantly 
attenuated peak FMD response was measured (mean ± 
SD): BL group 5.9% ± 4.6% vs EB group 1.9% ± 2.1%; 
P = 0.03). Given the increased consumption of energy 
beverages associated with exercise in young adults, 
more research is needed.
CONCLUSION
Energy beverage consumption has a negative impact 
on arterial endothelial function in young healthy adults.

INTRODUCTION
Energy beverages are being consumed increasingly 
worldwide, and have been associated with deaths in 
adolescents and young adults, especially when consumed 
while exercising
[1].
What effect these energy drinks have on endothelial 
cells could help explain its effect on the cardiovascular 
system. These cells are part of the inner lining of blood 
vessels and have metabolic and also synthetic functions
[2]. 
When endothelial cells are functioning abnormally or 
“endothelial dysfunction”, it is associated with poor 
vascular reactivity, pro-thrombosis, pro-adhesion, pro-
inflammation, and growth promotion
[1,3].
Several recent reviews on cardiovascular compli-
cations associated with energy drink consumption 
suggest that the impact on endothelial function could 
be a factor in subsequent cardiac events
[1,4]. Some of 
their ingredients individually or in combination may be 
associated with reduced endothelial function
[5-7]. 
Mechanistically, endothelial dysfunction, where the 
endothelium’s ability in regulating vascular resistance 
is impaired, may be related to reduced coronary blood 
flow
[6,8]. Following exposure to stress such as exposure 
to cold, mental arithmetic, anger
, exercise, cigarette 
smoking, cocaine, excess food or alcohol, the impaired 
ability to dilate the coronary arteries could result in 
supply-demand imbalance or coronary spasm, potentially 
leading to myocardial ischemia, coronary vasospasm, 
thrombosis and/or cardiac arrhythmia
[6,9]. Importantly, 
this acute endothelial dysfunction could lead to ischemia, 
which in turn could lead to serious arrhythmia, coronary 
vasospasm, and myocardial infarction
[1,6,10]. 
This study describes the acute changes of normal 
endothelial function after consumption of a single can of 
a popular energy drink
[11]. 
MATERIALS AND METHODS
After fasting from caffeine for at least 24 h and food for 
at least 8 h prior
, eleven healthy non-smoker medical 
students (9 males), average age 24.5 years (range 
23-27 years), average BMI 22.8, received an electro-
cardiogram (ECG), blood pressure and pulse check, 
and underwent baseline testing (BL) of endothelial 
function using the technique of endothelium-dependent 
flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) with high-resolution 
ultrasound according to recommended guidelines of the 
University of Wisconsin Atherosclerosis Imaging Research 
Program Core Laboratory by a single registered vascular 
ultrasonographer who was certified by the University of 
Wisconsin Atherosclerosis Imaging Research Program 
Core Laboratory
[12]. 
After resting supine for 10-min in a temperature-
controlled room, a blood pressure cuff was placed on the 
widest part of proximal right forearm approximately 1 cm 
distal to the antecubital fossa. Using a 10 MHz resolution 
linear array vascular ultrasound transducer with a 
Philips iE33 ultrasound machine, the brachial artery was 
located above the elbow and scanned in longitudinal 
sections. After recording baseline B-mode digital images 
of the brachial artery and spectral Doppler images of 
163

Higgins JP et al. Energy drink attenuates endothelial function
 flow, the forearm cuff was inflated to 250 mmHg for 5 
min to induce reactive hyperemia. Immediately after 
deflation, spectral Doppler images are obtained to verify 
hyperemia. FMD of the brachial artery was measured 
60 and 90 s after cuff deflation. The relative FMD (%) 
was calculated as the ratio between the largest post-
cuff release and the baseline diameter
. Each image was 
checked for quality control, and each artery diameter 
was measured from the media to media points by two 
experts, 3 measurements at the QRS complex, repeated 
on 3 separate beats, and then averaged.
The subjects then drank an energy beverage (EB), 
a 24-oz can of Monster Energy Drink® in approximately 
1 min. The contents of this can include 54 g Sucrose, 
glucose, sucralose, maltodextrin, Sodium 360 mg Sodium 
Citrate Sodium Chloride, Caffeine 240 mg, T
aurine 2000 
mg, Niacin 40 mg 200% RDA Niacinamide, Pyridoxine 4 
mg 200% RDA, Cyanocobalamin (B12) 12 mcg 200% 
RDA, Riboflavin (B2) 3.4 mg 200% RDA, Ginseng Extract 
400 mg, Glucuronolactone, Inositol (B8), Guarana Extract, 
and L-Carnitine all listed as a part of a 5000 mg “Energy 
Blend”
, and Sodium Benzoate. 
The subjects had FMD repeated at 90 min after 
consumption of the EB. The subjects were in the supine 
position for all ECGs and FMD measurements.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were performed by John P Higgins 
and the statistical methods of this study were reviewed 
by Benjamin Yang using Microsoft Excel 2010 and the 
Data Analysis T
oolPak. We used the t-test: Paired Two 
Sample for Means, and significance was defined as a 
P-value of 0.05 or less.

2. 
The hemodynamics were as follows, BL vs EB group 
respectively (mean ± SD): Heart rate 65.2 ± 11.3 vs 
68.2 ± 11.8 beats per minute, systolic blood pressure 
114.0 ± 10.4 mmHg vs 114.1 ± 10.4 mmHg, Diastolic 
blood pressure 68.8 ± 9.3 mmHg vs 70.6 ± 7.1 mmHg; 
all were not significantly different. 
With drinking the energy beverage, a significantly 
attenuated peak FMD response was found (mean ± 
SD): BL group 5.9% ± 4.6% vs EB group 1.9% ± 2.1%; 
P = 0.03 (Figure 1).
DISCUSSION
There are few studies exploring the effects on endo-
thelial function following consumption of energy drinks. 
In one study, fifty healthy volunteers (34 male, aged 
22 ± 2 years) consumed either a 250-mL sugar-free 
energy drink or 250 mL carbonated water (control)
[13]. 
They found that an hour after consumption of an energy 
drink, there was an acute decreased in endothelial 
function and increased platelet aggregation
[7,13]. 
Another study involving 25 healthy young adults 
(13 male, aged 22.5 ± 0.6 years) who consumed either 
355-mL Red Bull or 355-ml tap water noted that 2 h 
later
, while blood pressure, heart rate and cardiac output 
were significantly increased, there was no reduction in 
endothelial function via finger skin microcirculation
[14]. 
A 47-year-old healthy Caucasian male was noted to 
have a progressive attenuation of peak flow-mediated 
dilatation at 45 and 90 min following consumption of a 
24-oz can of Monster Energy Drink®[7].
Energy drinks likely increase myocardial oxygen 
demand, and this may be increased under stress. For 
example, one study has noted that the combination of 
Red Bull and mental stress results in greater increases 
in heart rate and blood pressure, i.e., a greater cardio-
vascular load
[15].
 
While our study has noted a change in endothelial 
function after consumption of energy drinks, which 
is consistent with some of the previous studies, it still 
however conflicts with other studies. A possible ex-
planation for these contrasting results on endothelial 
function, blood pressure, and heart rate in response to 
energy drinks include difference in methods of assessing 
endothelial function, difference in methods of monitoring 
blood pressure, difference in types of energy drinks 
consumed, difference in study participant profiles, and 
varying environmental stimuli
[15,16].
 Further investigations 
should take in account these differences, and also 
investigate how energy drink consumption in stress 
conditions affect endothelial function, as it would help 
simulate conditions in which energy drinks are used in 
real-life.
Weaknesses of our study include the fact that human 
measurement was performed on the arterial segments, 
which may be less accurate than automated detection 
methods. However one study analyzing variability and

the specific physiological effects they are having be elucidated. Further, due 
to the possibility that endothelial dysfunction may play a role in morbidity with 
concomitant energy drink intake and exercise, more research is recommended 
to clarify the mechanisms of and significance of these effects. 
Terminology
Energy drinks are also known as energy beverages. Popular brand names 
include Monster Energy Drink® and Red Bull Energy Drink® that contain high 
caffeine content, along with other ingredients. Flow-mediated dilatation is a 
non-invasive technique using high-resolution ultrasound to assess a vessel’s 
endothelium-dependent (nitric oxide release) vasomotor function. 
Peer-review
In this study, Dr. Higgins and his colleagues have done a very interesting 
investigation even though the report is very brief. They show a significant result 
that one kind of the “energy beverage” is associated with endothelial disfunction. 
The study is well designed and outcome is enough to warn the lovers of those 
drinks.

Potential improvements in the future include a water load 
as a control, and having FMD baseline measurements 
performed on one day, followed by the FMD measure-
ments with energy beverage consumption on the next 
day. In addition, this was a small sample, and such 
medical student volunteers may be healthier than the 
normal population. 
Consumption of energy drinks may lead to an 
acute attenuation of endothelial function. Given the 
popularity of energy drinks, especially among youth, the 
combination of their consumption and exercise/extreme 
sports, and the rise in emergency room visits associated 
with their consumption, it is important that the specific 
physiological effects they are having be elucidated. Due 
to the potential endothelial dysfunction that may occur 
with energy drinks and the potential morbidity when 
consumed with exercise, further research is needed 
to explore these mechanisms and significance of their 
effects. 
COMMENTS
Background 
Energy drinks are being consumed more and more worldwide, and have been 
associated with deaths in adolescents and young adults, especially when 
consumed while exercising. Adverse cardiovascular events can be caused by 
abnormal endothelial cell function or “endothelial dysfunction”. Endothelial cells 
form the inner lining of blood vessels and have metabolic as well as synthetic 
functions, which allow them to carry out multiple important tasks such as 
regulating vascular resistance. Mechanistically, reduced coronary blood flow 
may be a symptom of endothelial dysfunction, and is associated with poor 
vascular reactivity, pro-thrombosis, pro-adhesion, pro-inflammation, and growth 
promotion.
Research frontiers 
There is a paucity of studies describing the effects on endothelial function 
following consumption of energy drinks. Several recent reviews on cardiovascular 
complications associated with energy drink consumption suggest that effects 
on endothelial function may play a role in subsequent cardiac events. Some of 
their ingredients individually or in combination may be associated with reduced 
endothelial function. 
Innovations and breakthroughs
The current study describes the acute changes of normal endothelial function 
following consumption of a single can of a popular energy drink. While the 
study has noted a change in endothelial function after consumption of energy 
drinks, which is consistent with some of the previous studies, it still however 
conflicts with other studies. A possible explanation into these contrasting results 
on endothelial function, blood pressure, and heart rate in response to energy 
drinks include a difference in study methods and energy drink types. Further 
investigations should take in account these differences, and also investigate 
how energy drink consumption in stress conditions affect endothelial function, 
as it would help simulate conditions in which energy drinks are used in real-life.
Applications
Consumption of energy drinks may lead to an acute attenuation of endothelial 
function. Given the popularity of energy drinks, especially among youth, the 
combination of their consumption and exercise/extreme sports, and the rise in 
emergency room visits associated with their consumption, it is important that
