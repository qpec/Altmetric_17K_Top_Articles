Infection with Burkholderia pseudomallei causes melioidosis, a disease with a high mortality rate (20% in Australia and 40% in
Southeast Asia). Neurological melioidosis is particularly prevalent in northern Australian patients and involves brain stem infec-
tion, which can progress to the spinal cord; however, the route by which the bacteria invade the central nervous system (CNS) is
unknown. We have previously demonstrated that B. pseudomallei can infect the olfactory and trigeminal nerves within the nasal
cavity following intranasal inoculation. As the trigeminal nerve projects into the brain stem, we investigated whether the bacte-
ria could continue along this nerve to penetrate the CNS. After intranasal inoculation of mice, B. pseudomallei caused low-level
localized infection within the nasal cavity epithelium, prior to invasion of the trigeminal nerve in small numbers. B. pseudomal-
lei rapidly invaded the trigeminal nerve and crossed the astrocytic barrier to enter the brain stem within 24 h and then rapidly
progressed over 2,000 �m into the spinal cord. To rule out that the bacteria used a hematogenous route, we used a capsule-defi-
cient mutant of B. pseudomallei that does not survive in the blood and found that it also entered the CNS via the trigeminal
nerve. This suggests that the primary route of entry is via the nerves that innervate the nasal cavity. We found that actin-medi-
ated motility could facilitate initial infection of the olfactory epithelium. Thus, we have demonstrated that B. pseudomallei can
rapidly infect the brain and spinal cord via the trigeminal nerve branches that innervate the nasal cavity.
B
acterial infections of the brain can be extremely severe with
high rates of morbidity and mortality (1), highlighting the
need for elucidating the mechanisms of central nervous system
(CNS) infection. The nasal cavity is innervated by the olfactory
and trigeminal nerves (cranial nerves 1 and 5, respectively), both
of which constitute potential direct conduits to the brain: the ol-
factory nerve terminates in the olfactory bulb, whereas the trigem-
inal nerve makes direct contact with the brain stem.
We and others have shown that olfactory glia, olfactory en-
sheathing cells (OECs), play an essential role in preventing micro-
bial invasion of the olfactory nerve by phagocytosing microorgan-
isms (2, 3). The glia of the trigeminal nerve are Schwann cells,
which are also phagocytic and remove debris after peripheral
nerve injury as well as at least some types of bacteria (3, 4). Thus,
glial cells in the nerves that innervate the nasal cavity constitute
potentially critical defenses against microbial invasion of the
brain.
To date, only a few microorganisms have been suggested as
being able to invade the olfactory or trigeminal nerves. These are
Burkholderia pseudomallei (5, 6), Chlamydia pneumoniae (7),
Streptococcus pneumoniae (8), Neisseria meningitidis (9), Salmo-
nella enterica, and Nocardia cyriacigeorgica (10), and the amoebo-
flagellate Naegleria fowlerii (11). We have shown that B. pseu-
domallei can invade the brain via the olfactory nerve in mice (6),
and that infection led to the death of olfactory neurons and their
axons, resulting in the formation of open channels lined by OECs.
The open channels provided the bacteria with a direct conduit
into the olfactory bulb in the forebrain. B. pseudomallei also pen-
etrated branches of the trigeminal nerve locally in the nasal cavity
(6), leading to the possibility that the infection could progress
further along the trigeminal nerve and potentially involve the
brain stem or even the spinal cord. Invasion of the trigeminal
nerve is well documented as a translocation pathway by which
viruses such as the herpes simplex virus invade the CNS (12–15).
In addition to B. pseudomallei, only one bacterial species has been
suggested, but not directly shown, to infect the trigeminal nerve:
Listeria monocytogenes, the most common cause of bacterial men-
ingitis, with a mortality rate of up to 40 to 60% (16, 17). However,
direct evidence of any bacteria using this pathway to invade the
brain stem is so far lacking.
Infection with B. pseudomallei causes melioidosis, which has an
estimated worldwide prevalence of around 165,000 cases each
year, with an annual death toll of 89,000 (18). B. pseudomallei is
endemic in 45 countries and is predicted to also be endemic in
another 34 countries, where it is considered to be underreported
(18). In northern Australia and Southeast Asia, which are the re-
gions where it is most prevalent, the disease has mortality rates of
up to 20% and 40%, respectively (19). In humans, the neurologi-

 cal form of melioidosis involves infection of the brain stem, which
may progress to the spinal cord (20–22). As the trigeminal nerve
innervates the face and nasal region and connects directly to the
brain stem, we hypothesized that bacteria migrate along this nerve
to penetrate the brain stem and thereby bypass the blood-brain
and blood-cerebrospinal fluid barriers. The aim of the present
study was therefore to determine whether B. pseudomallei uses the
trigeminal nerve as a route of entry into the spinal cord.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Bacterial strains and growth conditions. B. pseudomallei strain
MSHR520 (previously strain 08) (23) is a clinical isolate from a human
case of melioidosis, donated by Bart Currie (Menzies School of Health
Research, Darwin, Australia). Allele replacement mutants of MSHR520
lacking capsule (MSHR520 �cap) or capsule and BimA (MSHR520 �cap
�bimA) have been previously described (5, 24). The fliC in-frame deletion
mutant, derived from MSHR520, was constructed as previously described
(24); the deletion encompassed nucleotides 33937849 and 33938757 with
reference to the nucleotide sequence of K96243, locus BPSL3319 (25). B.
pseudomallei cells were grown with aeration in liquid lysogeny broth (LB)
media.
Animals. Adult transgenic S100�-DsRed mice (26) were inoculated
intranasally with B. pseudomallei strain MSHR520 (n � 10 animals) or
MSHR520 �cap (n � 5 animals) by placing a 5-�l droplet of bacteria into
each nostril. The inoculum contained 3 � 105 stationary-phase cells re-
suspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Control mice were given
PBS alone; 11 noninfected and 10 infected mice were analyzed. Blood and
spleen examined 24 h postinoculation with wild-type or �cap bacteria
showed �5 CFU in blood (per ml) and spleen (per spleen) for the �cap
strain, compared with 34 CFU and 103 CFU for the wild-type bacteria
(n � 5 animals for each of �cap strain and wild-type bacteria). Procedures
were approved by ESK/03/15/AEC Griffith University and the University
Animal Ethics Committee at Queensland University of Technology under
the guidelines of the Australian Commonwealth Office of the Gene Tech-
nology Regulator.
Tissue preparation and sectioning. Mice were sacrificed by a lethal
intraperitoneal injection of sodium pentobarbitone (Lethabarb), and tis-
sue was fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS overnight at 4°C and decal-
cified in 20% EDTA. For whole-mount preparations, the superior skull
and brain were removed, and the trigeminal nerve was dissected out.
Specimens were embedded in optimal cutting temperature (OCT) me-
dium and frozen, and coronal and sagittal sections (30 �m) were cut on a
cryostat.
Immunohistochemistry. Immunohistochemistry was performed as
previously described (6). Whole-mount specimens were incubated with
rabbit anti-B. pseudomallei polyclonal antibodies (5, 6) for 3 days at 4°C
and then incubated with goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated sec-
ondary antibodies. Cryostat sections were incubated with either anti-B.
pseudomallei polyclonal antibodies or goat anti-glial fibrillary acidic pro-
tein (anti-GFAP) antibodies (ab53554; Abcam), followed by either don-
key anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated secondary antibodies or don-
key anti-goat Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated secondary antibodies; some
sections were incubated with 4=,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI).
Imagecapture.ImageswerecapturedusinganOlympusBX50epifluo-
rescence microscope, an Olympus SZX16 epifluorescent stereo micro-
scope, or an Olympus FV1000 laser scanning confocal microscope. For
comparison of control antibody staining using the confocal microscope,
the same image capture settings, laser intensity, and focal depth were used.
Captured images were color balanced uniformly across the field of view
with Adobe Photoshop CC 2015 and compiled into panels with Adobe
Illustrator CC 2015.
Competition assays. The �cap �bimA and �cap �fliC mutants of B.
pseudomallei were tested for their capacity to infect upper respiratory tract
tissues in BALB/c mice (nasal mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue [NALT]
and olfactory mucosa [OM]) and olfactory bulb (OB) by competition
assays (27) against an isogenic �cap but bioluminescent B. pseudomallei
Tn7 omp-lux �cap strain (5). The �cap lux� derivative was also used in a
competition assay against the isogenic nonbioluminescent �cap lux-neg-
ative strain to ascertain any possible in vivo fitness disadvantage of the
lux� strain. Each of the two strains used in a competition assay was grown
in LB medium and mixed in a ratio of 1:1, and 3 � 105 CFU used for
inoculation of mice. The ratio of each strain in the inoculum, the input
ratio (the ratio of the test strain to the �cap lux� strain), was determined
by plating appropriate dilutions on LB medium containing streptomycin
and counting the ratio of Lux� to Lux� colonies. Likewise, the output
ratio in NALT, olfactory epithelium, and olfactory bulb was determined
following dissection and homogenization of tissues and plating. The Lux
phenotype was determined by imaging of the plates with a Bertholt Night-
Owl camera system. The competition index (CI) was determined by di-
viding the output ratio by the input ratio. It may be noted that the �cap
lux� strain exhibited no significant fitness disadvantage when competed
in vitro over at least 15 generations in LB medium (containing no antibi-
otics) against the isogenic (nonbioluminescent) �cap strain: CIs of 0.79
and 1.10 were obtained in two independent experiments. Competition
indices in vivo were approximately 2 (1.9 � 0.47, 2.0 � 0.33, and 1.45 �
0.24 for NALT, olfactory epithelium, and olfactory bulb, respectively),
indicating a slight disadvantage of the Lux� strain in vivo. Five indepen-
dent experiments were performed. Each lux mutant “test” bacterial geno-
type (�cap, �cap �fliC, and �cap �bimA) and each tissue was examined in
duplicate, triplicate, or quadruplet experiments: the �cap �bimA strain,
for example, was used in 4 experiments for the OM, 3 for the NALT, and
2 for the OB. The total number of animals examined (n [between 6 and
24]) for each tissue represents the cumulative number of animals for all
the relevant experiments (for example n � 8, 24, and 9 for NALT, OM,
and OB, respectively, in the case of the �cap �bimA strain). Blood was
taken by heart puncture from each animal, in addition to the relevant
organs, and plated to determine CFU. In all cases, colonies were not de-
tected at 24 h postinfection (�5 CFU/ml). Statistical analysis was per-
formed using Prism software with a one-way analysis of variance
(ANOVA) followed by post hoc Bonferroni’s test, with the alpha value set
at 0.05.

RESULTS
Burkholderia pseudomallei penetrates the nasal epithelium to
invade the trigeminal nerve. This study was undertaken to inves-
tigate whether B. pseudomallei could invade the brain stem via the
trigeminal nerve branches that innervate the nasal cavity (Fig. 1A).
Transgenic reporter S100�-DsRed mice (26) were used, in which
all glial cells, including Schwann cells, express the red fluorescent
protein DsRed. Using these mice, the trigeminal nerve, in which
individual axons are surrounded by Schwann cells, can be easily
detected (for example, see Fig. 1E). Adult S100�-DsRed mice were
intranasally inoculated with wild-type B. pseudomallei and then
analyzed after 24 h.
Within the caudal nasal cavity, the dorsal region is lined with
olfactory epithelium, which is primarily found along the septum
and around the turbinates (nasal concha), an elongated spiral
bone shelf inside the nasal cavity (Fig. 1B). In adult healthy non-
infected control mice, the olfactory epithelium remained intact
and smooth in appearance, with no exudate present within the
nasal cavity (data not shown). In mice that had been inoculated
with B. pseudomallei, the olfactory epithelium reacted to the pres-
ence of the bacteria by mild crenellation and the production of
exudate within the nasal cavity (Fig. 1B). Immunohistochemistry
using antibodies against B. pseudomallei revealed the presence of
bacteria within the nasal cavity and olfactory epithelium (Fig. 1C).

 Individual bacteria were occasionally present within the lamina
propria, the connective tissue layer found below the olfactory ep-
ithelium (Fig. 1D). Branches of the trigeminal nerve are present
within the lamina propria, and B. pseudomallei cells were found
proximal to trigeminal nerve branches (Fig. 1E and F). In addition
to B. pseudomallei rods, multiple immunoreactive punctate parti-
cles that measured less than 1 �m in diameter were detected
around the rods (Fig. 1F). These have been previously associated
with the presence of B. pseudomallei in inoculated mice (6) and
may be outer membrane vesicles (28) or products of the degrada-
tion of B. pseudomallei.
Burkholderia pseudomallei infection spreads to the caudal
region of the trigeminal nerve. The branches of the trigeminal
nerve converge at the trigeminal ganglions, where they connect
with the brain stem (Fig. 1A). To elucidate whether bacteria mi-
grate along the trigeminal nerve, whole-mount imaging was used.
In whole-mount heads of S100�-DsRed mice, the trajectory of the
trigeminal nerve to the caudal region of the cranial cavity could be
visualized due to the S100�-DsRed-expressing Schwann cells (Fig.
1G and H). Whole-mount immunohistochemistry revealed B.
pseudomallei cells within patches and in small numbers along the
trigeminal nerve; some of the patches of B. pseudomallei appeared
to be present within a single Schwann cell (Fig. 1I). Higher mag-
nification of the whole-mount nerve revealed B. pseudomallei
rods, which were often found in isolation (Fig. 1J). The associated

 were observed in Fig. 1F were also present; however, they were
only visible if the fluorescence was overexposed, due to the depth
of tissue (Fig. 1K). (In panel K, some particles are indicated by
fletched arrows.)
We next examined tissue sections using higher-magnification
confocal microscopy. Immunolabeling of cryostat sections of the
olfactory mucosa was performed to confirm that B. pseudomallei
invaded the trigeminal nerve. Within the olfactory mucosa that
lines the nasal cavity, immunolabeled B. pseudomallei cells were
detected within a branch of the trigeminal nerve within the lamina
propria (Fig. 1L). To confirm the identity of the olfactory versus
the trigeminal nerve fascicles, immunohistochemistry using anti-
bodies against olfactory marker protein (OMP) was performed as
OMP is selectively expressed by olfactory sensory neurons and
their axons but not axons of the trigeminal nerve. The immuno-
labeling showed that the OMP-positive olfactory nerve fascicles
were more apical than the trigeminal nerve fascicles. In this strain
of mice, B. pseudomallei immunolabeling was only detected
within the trigeminal nerve branches and not in the olfactory
nerve branches. Also of note was that the olfactory epithelium
remained relatively intact, as evidenced by the presence of numer-
ous olfactory sensory neurons (Fig. 1L).
By using sagittal sections of the entire heads of mice, the tri-
geminal nerves were examined along their trajectory from the na-
sal cavity to the merge into the brain stem. Immunolabeling re-
vealed that isolated individual B. pseudomallei rods were present
throughout the nerve (Fig. 1M and N). The immunoreactive fluo-
rescent particles were also present, although they were more no-
ticeable toward the rostral end of the trigeminal nerve (Fig. 1M).
B. pseudomallei cells were present in patches along the trigeminal
nerve and separated by regions of the nerve where no bacteria or
immunoreactive particles were detected (data not shown). These
observations were consistent with those from the whole-mount
analysis (Fig. 1G to K). Nuclear staining revealed that the numbers
of host cells in the areas of bacteria invasion did not increase (Fig.
1O), suggesting that circulating immune cells had not been re-
cruited to the infected area.
To investigate whether B. pseudomallei cells were localized only
to the trigeminal nerve, areas adjacent to the trigeminal nerve and
the entire brain were also analyzed. These analyses showed the
presence of B. pseudomallei and associated immunoreactive par-
ticles was exclusive to the trigeminal nerve; the bacteria were not
detected in other areas (data not shown). To verify that immuno-
labeling was specific for B. pseudomallei, sections of uninfected
mice were also immunolabeled for B. pseudomallei, and the nasal
region, trigeminal nerve, and adjacent brain tissue were analyzed.
Importantly, no immunoreactivity was observed in any of the
noninfected mice (data not shown).
To verify that B. pseudomallei cells were not penetrating the
brain via alternative routes (in particular, via the blood-brain-
barrier), an acapsular mutant strain (�cap) of B. pseudomallei was
used. The capsule is required for survival and persistence in the
blood (6, 29). We found that the B. pseudomallei �cap mutant
similarly penetrated the trigeminal nerve and reached the caudal
region of the nerve 24 h following inoculation (Fig. 1P). Since this
strain cannot survive in the blood, it is highly unlikely to have
entered the brain via hematogenous spread.
Burkholderia pseudomallei infection progresses into the
brain stem. We next examined the brain stem for the presence of
the bacteria to determine if infection spreads to the CNS following
intranasal inoculation. The trigeminal nerve projects to the brain
stem, which then connects with the spinal cord (Fig. 2A and B).
The protective barrier around the CNS, the glia limitans, com-
prises astrocytes that express GFAP (Fig. 2C) and clearly delin-
eates the border between the peripheral and central nervous sys-
tems. B. pseudomallei was detected within the most caudal region
of the trigeminal nerve (peripheral nervous system [Fig. 2D]) and
within the brain stem (CNS [Fig. 2E]).
Burkholderia pseudomallei infection penetrates the spinal
cord. The brain stem connects directly with the spinal cord (Fig.
2A), with the division between the brain stem and spinal cord
being easily identified by the smaller diameter of the nervous tis-
sue at the rostral spinal cord (Fig. 2F). The transition from brain
stem to spinal cord can also be identified by a change in the ap-
pearance of the nervous tissue, reflected in different cell types and
layers (Fig. 2G). Since the spinal cord connects directly with the
end of the brain stem, analysis of the spinal cord for the presence
of B. pseudomallei was performed to investigate whether bacteria
could migrate from the brain stem to the spinal cord. Within the
spinal cord closest to the brain stem, multiple immunoreactive
particles were present in small patches (Fig. 2H). Other areas
within the same tissue section contained no immunoreactive bac-
teria or particles (data not shown). This correlates with our obser-
vations of the trigeminal nerve and suggests that B. pseudomallei
infection progresses along the spinal cord either in very small
patches or as isolated individual bacteria. The spinal cords of con-
trol noninfected mice were also immunolabeled with anti-B. pseu-
domallei antibodies, and immunoreactivity was not detected (data
not shown). The immunoreactivity was observed in several mice
(n � 4); however, it is of interest to note that immunoreactive
areas were never detected toward the edges of the spinal cord,
where GFAP-positive astrocytes were present; bacterial staining
was only detected within the deeper layers of the spinal cord. Fur-
ther down the spinal cord, B. pseudomallei rods were detected
without the typically associated immunoreactive particles (Fig. 2I
and J, see Movie S1 in the supplemental material). Overall, it ap-
peared that fewer B. pseudomallei cells were present within the
spinal cord than in the trigeminal nerve. For mice that exhibited
immunoreactivity for B. pseudomallei within the spinal cord, we
examined the nasal cavity for signs of infection. Some mice that
had bacteria in the spinal cord had widespread infection within
the nasal cavity, while other mice had very little signs of infection,
with minor disruption to the caudal epithelium (Fig. 2K). The
total rate of infection progression from the nasal cavity to the
deepest region in the spinal cord where bacteria were detected was
0.9 mm per h, corresponding to 22 mm in 24 h.
Role of bacterial motility. The movement of bacteria within the
olfactory and trigeminal nerve fascicles (5, 6; this report) raises the
question of whether it is passive or involves bacterial motility. We
therefore considered the possible role of actin-mediated motility,
which requires the B. pseudomallei protein BimA (30), or of polar
flagella, which requires the flagellin structural gene (FliC) (31).
Accordingly, competition indices (CIs) were determined in
mixed infections of BALB/c mice between bimA or fliC mutants
and the wild type as a measure of the role of BimA or FliC, respec-
tively, in infection of the upper respiratory tract. All strains were
additionally capsule deficient (�cap) to preclude infection via
blood. The lux operon was used to mark one strain, and compe-
tition between this strain and the lux-negative parent strain
(MSHR520 �cap) was included as a control. The results indicate

 that while FliC is not involved, CIs for infection of nasal mucosa-
associated lymphoid tissue, olfactory mucosa, and the olfactory
bulb are significantly reduced in the bimA strain (Fig. 2L). Thus,
BimA plays a role in infection of upper respiratory tract tissue, pre-
sumably via actin-mediated cell-to-cell dissemination, and in infec-
tion of the outer layer of the olfactory bulb within the cranial cavity.
Summary of results. In summary, the results of this study
show that intranasal inoculation with B. pseudomallei leads to in-
fection of the trigeminal nerve without evidence of extensive in-
fection of the nasal epithelium. Once within the confines of the
trigeminal nerve, bacteria crossed the glia limitans, penetrated the
CNS, and then continued into the spinal cord (Fig. 3).
DISCUSSION
We have demonstrated that B. pseudomallei, which causes me-
lioidosis, can enter the CNS (brain and spinal cord) via the nasal
branches of the trigeminal nerve. Our findings are consistent with
clinical studies of melioidosis. Neurological melioidosis fre-
quently involves the brain stem (21, 22, 32), and while less fre-
quently reported, neurological melioidosis can affect the spinal
cord, causing paraplegia (20). In one pediatric case, it was sug-
gested that partial paralysis of the foot may have resulted from
bacterial invasion of the spinal cord via a nerve root pathway sec-
ondary to a skin lesion. In a second pediatric case, skin lesions on
the face were suggested to have resulted in trigeminal nerve inva-
sion (33). Hence our results, in providing evidence of direct inva-
sion of the brain stem and spinal cord secondary to trigeminal
nerve invasion, are consistent with human clinical manifestations
of neurological melioidosis.
In our previous study, we demonstrated local, peripheral, in-
fection of the distal trigeminal nerve branches in the nasal epithe-
lium (6). The bacteria were restricted to empty conduits encased
by Schwann cells, as the trigeminal axons had been destroyed by
the infection. In this study, once bacteria had penetrated the tri-

Downloaded from 
 geminal nerve, they were present in small numbers and in discrete
patches. The low level of infection, together with limited immu-
nological surveillance in the CNS, may preclude a major immu-
nological response. This is consistent with two well-described fea-
tures of infection by B. pseudomallei. First, significant numbers of
the population in the two main regions of endemicity (tropical
Australia and Thailand) are seropositive, although the seroposi-
tivity rates in these two regions differ greatly (34). However, al-
though indicating infection by B. pseudomallei, there is great un-
certainty regarding the relationship between such prior infection
and current latent infection (34). Second, latency following dis-
ease with subsequent recrudescence (sometimes decades later) is
described in a minority of cases (34, 35). Such patterns of subclin-
ical infection are consistent with low-level invasion of the brain
stem and spinal cord. It is of interest that bacteria can cause re-
stricted destruction of a small number of axons, as patients who
develop clinical neurological symptoms do not always have de-
tectable foci of infection or indications of pyogenic infection, even
after autopsy (22). This suggests that low-level infection can pro-
duce the clinical neurological symptoms, possibly through the de-
struction of key axonal pathways. An alternative route by which
bacteria can reach the brain is via hematogenous spread and cross-
ing the blood-brain barrier and/or cerebrospinal fluid barrier. We
show here that the �cap strain can still penetrate the trigeminal
nerve, suggesting that the trigeminal nerve is indeed the primary
route by which the bacteria infect the CNS.
The method by which bacteria move along the empty trigem-
inal, or olfactory, nerve fascicles is uncertain, but could involve
bacterial motility. The apparent role of BimA in infection of the
olfactory bulb may be related either (i) to movement along the
olfactory nerve through open channels or (ii) to the means of
access to the nerves. Considering that BimA is unlikely to be di-
rectly involved in movement within the nerve fascicles themselves,
then passive movement is rendered more likely. With regard to the
latter, infection of the nasal mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue
and olfactory mucosa is significantly reduced in the bimA strain;
reduced olfactory mucosal infection would presumably cause re-
duced infection of the olfactory nerve fascicles, and hence of the
olfactory bulb, since the bacteria invade the olfactory bulb via the
olfactory nerve fascicles (6). Similarly, spread via the trigeminal
nerve fascicles could be influenced by BimA-facilitated infection
of the olfactory mucosa in order to gain access to the trigeminal
nerve endings; alternatively BimA-mediated uptake by Schwann
cells and cell-to-cell spread may facilitate entry to the nerve fasci-
cle. Significantly, our data showing that absence of BimA results in
reduced olfactory bulb infection are in accord with clinical data
strongly suggesting a link between BimA function and neurolog-
ical melioidosis (36). There are two alleles of bimA extant in B.
pseudomallei: one, bimABp, typical of the majority of B. pseu-
domallei isolates, and another, bimABm, resembling that from
Burkholderia mallei and present in 12.1% of Australian isolates
(37). Specifically these authors (36) reported a significant associ-
ation of the bimABm allele with cases of neurological melioidosis.
MSHR520 contains the bimABp allele (37, 38), and it will be of
interest to compare isogenic strains carrying each allele for their
capacity to infect, or maintain infection of, the olfactory and tri-
geminal nerve fascicles. Considering that FliC and BimA are un-
likely to be directly involved in movement within the nerve fasci-
cles themselves, then passive movement is rendered more likely.
In the present study, where we used Quackenbush mice, the
background of our S100�-DsRed transgenic line, the penetration
of bacteria into the trigeminal nerve did not require widespread or
severe infection of the nasal epithelium. Indeed, in those mice in
which bacteria were detected within the brain stem and spinal
cord, there was little evidence of widespread infection within the
nasal cavity. It has previously been shown that there are significant
differences between melioidosis infection in BALB/c mice and an-
other inbred mouse strain, C57BL/6, with BALB/c infection mim-
icking acute human melioidosis and C57BL/6 infection resem-
bling chronic infection in humans (39). Thus, it appears that the
infection observed in the outbred Quackenbush mouse strain may
resemble the infection in C57BL/6 mice more than the dramatic
acute infection in BALB/c mice.
In summary, our results demonstrate that after intranasal in-
oculation, B. pseudomallei can, possibly aided by actin-mediated
motility, infect branches of the trigeminal nerve that innervate the
nasal cavity, migrate along the trigeminal nerve, and traverse the
glia limitans to penetrate the brain stem and spinal cord within 24
h. Importantly, the bacterial invasion was at low levels and did
not require extensive infection of the nasal epithelium, consis-
tent with subclinical and clinical manifestations of human in-
fection and melioidosis. These results raise the possibility that
other bacteria that can cause brain and spinal cord infections
could also use the trigeminal nerve as a route of direct and
rapid entry into the CNS.
