IMPORTANCE Shift-to-shift transitions in care among house staff are associated with adverse
events. However, the association between end-of-rotation transition (in which care of the
patient is transferred) and adverse events is uncertain.
OBJECTIVE To examine the association of end-of-rotation house staff transitions with
mortality among hospitalized patients.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Retrospective multicenter cohort study of patients
admitted to internal medicine services (N = 230 701) at 10 university-affiliated US Veterans
Health Administration hospitals (2008-2014).
EXPOSURES Transition patients (defined as those admitted prior to an end-of-rotation
transition who died or were discharged within 7 days following transition) were stratified by
type of transition (intern only, resident only, or intern + resident) and compared with all other
discharges (control). An alternative analysis comparing admissions within 2 days before
transition with admissions on the same 2 days 2 weeks later was also conducted.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Theprimaryoutcomewasin-hospitalmortality.Secondary
outcomesincluded30-dayand90-daymortalityandreadmissionrates.Adifference-in-difference
analysis assessed whether outcomes changed after the 2011 Accreditation Council for
Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) duty hour regulations. Adjustments included age, sex,
race/ethnicity, month, year, length of stay, comorbidities, and hospital.

A
handoffisdefinedasthetransitionofpatientcaretoan-
other clinician through the transfer of information, re-
sponsibility, and authority.1 Increasing evidence indi-
cates shift-to-shift handoffs are a source of adverse events and
errors,2 and conversely, that interventions to improve such
handoffs may have meaningful benefits to patient safety.3-5
However, the risk surrounding handoffs may be contingent on
the type of transition. An understudied area is end-of-rotation
handoff,6-8inwhichresidentphysiciansturnovertheirservice—
often to entirely new teams, rather than just a brief overnight
period.Althoughlongerlengthofstayhasbeenassociatedwith
service change and hospitalist transitions,6,8-10 few investiga-
tors have demonstrated an association with mortality.7,11
On July 1, 2011, Accreditation Council for Graduate Medi-
cal Education (ACGME) duty-hour regulations limited first-
yearresidents(interns)to16continuoushoursofwork,12which
led to an increase in shift-to-shift handoffs among residency
programs.13 Despite these changes, safety outcomes and mor-
tality rates have remained unchanged,14 but transition-
related outcomes have not been examined. Although the
end-of-rotation transition would not have been directly af-
fected by duty hour regulations, residency programs com-
plied with these rules by adopting a day-float and night-float
shiftscheduleincontrasttotheformer24-hourcallschedule.15
This may have increased the proportion of residents receiv-
ing handoffs of new patients each rotation, with possible det-
rimental effects for patients already at risk of handoff-related
miscommunication, such as those undergoing end-of-
rotationtransitionincare.Therefore,thestudyobjectiveswere
to determine if end-of-rotation house staff transition was as-
sociated with greater mortality, and, if so, to assess the asso-
ciation of 2011 duty hour regulations with this relationship.
Methods
Study Design, Setting, and Patient Characteristics
This study was reviewed and approved by the Veterans Af-
fairs (VA) New York Harbor Healthcare System institutional re-
view board, which provided a waiver of consent for both the
patients and physicians in the study. A contact from the in-
ternal medicine residency program at each university affili-
ate was informed about the study, and the contact provided
informationontheirrotationhandoffdates.Verbalconsentwas
obtained with assurance of program and hospital anonymity
regarding any publication of data.
This was a retrospective cohort study of adult patients
(aged ≥18 years) discharged from 10 university-affiliated US
Veterans Health Administration hospitals from July 1, 2008,
through June 30, 2014. The 10 hospitals were chosen because
of the affiliated residency’
s ability to provide resident sched-
ules and specific service characteristics. Three residency pro-
grams were unable to provide switch dates back to 2008. For
these programs only the available switch dates were in-
cluded; the earlier years were excluded from the data set for
each program before analysis.
Data from the VA Corporate Data Warehouse was ac-
cessed through the VA Informatics and Computing Infrastruc-
ture (VINCI). VINCI compiles and stores data from all VA medi-
cal centers nationwide, and provides investigators the
analytical tools needed to complete research studies in the VA.
The Corporate Data Warehouse is a national repository of data
within VINCI from several administrative and clinical sources.
We included medical patients discharged from a general
medicine team, intensive care unit, coronary care unit, step-
down unit, or subspecialty team (such as cardiology, pul-
monology, hematology, or oncology). The majority of interns
and residents for each service were internal medicine–
specific house staff, but various nonmedical house staff
rotated as well; these data were not available for this study.
Nonmedical services or services that rotated on a different
schedule were excluded, as were patients with length of stay
less than 1 day to ensure patients were potentially exposed to
an end-of-rotation care transition during their stay. Exact
intern and resident switch dates were collected for each pro-
gram, but we were unable to further quantify transitions of
other clinicians potentially involved in the care of included
patients. In anticipation of this limitation, internal medicine
residency programs were included only if they provided all
inpatient coverage to their respective VA hospitals, rotated all
teams with the same block schedule, and did not share rota-
tion switch dates with attending physicians, fellows, or other
mid-level clinicians (ie, house staff switched on distinct
weeks from other clinicians). Some programs switched both
interns and residents within the same week (eg, Monday and
Tuesday), whereas some switched up to a week apart (eg, the
first and seventh of each month).
Data Collection, Study Cohorts, and Outcome Measures
Dataincludedage,sex,race/ethnicity,dischargeservice,length
of stay, all comorbidities indexed by the International Classi-
ficationofDiseases,NinthRevision,ClinicalModification(ICD-9)
codes, and discharge disposition. Race/ethnicity data were in-
cludedtoestimatethecharacteristicsofthepopulationserved.
They were based on standard, fixed categories used within the
US Veterans Health Administration and reflect the most re-
cent patient-identified category recorded at entry to VA health
services or point-of-care available in the VA’
s electronic medi-
cal record system. Comorbidities were used to construct the
Key Points
Question Are patients who are exposed to end-of-rotation
resident transition in care at risk for greater mortality, and is this
association related to the 2011 duty-hour regulations?
Findings In this multicenter cohort study of 230 701 patients
admitted to internal medicine services in 10 Veterans Affairs
hospitals, end-of-rotation house staff transition in care was
associated with significantly higher in-hospital mortality (3.5% for
intern only transition vs 2.0% for control and 4.0% for
intern + resident transition vs 2.1% for control). The association
was significantly stronger following institution of ACGME duty
hour regulations.
Meaning End-of-rotation transitions may introduce risk in internal
medicine inpatient care.

Elixhauser comorbidity score,16,17 which has been associated
with the risk of hospital death.18 We also obtained records of
anymortalityafterdischargeandreadmission.Thesedatawere
incorporated from the Beneficiary Identification Records
Locator Subsystem death records administrative file (an ad-
ditionaladministrativedatasourceavailablewithinVINCI)that
compiles mortality data from multiple VA sources, including
benefits and US Veterans Health Administration services.
Whether mortality at 30 or 90 days was directly related to the
index hospitalization could not be determined from the avail-
able data. Only data on discharge and admission to VA facili-
ties were available.
Intern and resident transition were considered indepen-
dently because they were sometimes separated in time and
because level of training may be associated with the quality
of the transition. Patients were divided into 2 groups: transi-
tion and control. For the main analysis, the transition group
included patients admitted at any time prior to an end-of-
rotation transition who either were discharged or died within
7 days following the transition (length-of-stay outliers >99th
percentile [>33 days] excluded). This definition was chosen to
ensure that the exposure group was limited to patients who
underwent end-of-rotation house staff transition, and to try
to ensure that longer stay patients—who may be at greater
risk for both transition and transition-related complications—
were included in the exposure group. The exposure group
was limited to those discharged or deceased within 7 days of
transition7 because effects of transition are likely attenuated
after prolonged exposure to the new team. All other dis-
charges were considered controls.
Transition patients whose admission spanned more than
1 transition were still included if discharged within 7 days fol-
lowing the final transition. However, this occurrence was un-
common because patients with length of stay greater than 33
dayswereexcluded.Additionally,sometransitionpatientsmay
have been represented in the control group if admitted prior
to transition and not discharged within 7 days of transition.
To evaluate if level of training was associated with outcomes,
we separately defined 3 sets of transition and control cohorts
stratified by exposure to intern transition, resident transi-
tion, or both intern + resident transition.
An alternate analysis was then conducted using a differ-
ent exposure definition, in which the transition group
included all patients admitted on either of the 2 days before
transition, and the control group included all patients admit-
ted on the same 2 days of the week, 2 weeks later.19 Patients
in the exposure group did not have to be discharged within a
week of transition. This definition ensures more comparable
patient populations but is limited to a subset of the patients,
excludes patients with long stays prior to transition, and has
more crossover between groups. We assessed the outcomes
of all admissions based on the assigned groups, regardless of
length of stay.
The primary outcome for all analyses was adjusted in-
hospital mortality rate. Secondary outcomes included
30-day and 90-day mortality and readmission rates. In all
analyses, 30-day and 90-day mortality were measured from
date of admission.
Statistical Analysis
The main objective was to determine whether end-of-rotation
transition in care was associated with greater mortality. First,
χ2 tests were used to determine if there were significant differ-
ences in unadjusted mortality in-hospital, at 30 days, and at 90
days between each transition group and control group. Sepa-
rate multivariable logistic regression models were constructed
for intern-only, resident-only, and intern + resident transi-
tions to examine the association of each type of transition with
hospital mortality, controlling for confounders. All models in-
cluded age, sex, race/ethnicity, length of hospital stay (outliers
>99thpercentiledeletedinmainanalyses),calendarmonth,cal-
endar year, individual hospital site, and the Elixhauser comor-
bidityscoreascovariates.Becausethenumberofindividualhos-
pital sites (N = 10) was small compared with the sample size,
theireffectswereconsideredfixedinregressionmodels.Tofur-
ther evaluate for hospital outliers, we repeated analyses using
separate models for each hospital in the main analysis.
To evaluate whether the 2011 ACGME duty hour restric-
tions had differential associations with patients undergoing
end-of-rotation transitions, multivariable logistic regression
models were constructed that included a variable for ACGME
period (before duty hour regulations [July 1, 2008, to June 30,
2011] or after duty hour regulations [July 1, 2011, to June 30,
2014]) and an interaction between ACGME period and transi-
tion (difference-in-differences models). Similar to other out-
comes, these analyses were stratified by type of transition.
After completing the primary analyses, we repeated the
analyses to assess secondary outcomes including 30-day and
90-daymortalityand30-dayand90-dayreadmissionrates.For
30-day and 90-day mortality, we used individual patient data
andselectedthelastavailableadmissionperpatient,ratherthan
including all admissions. Statistical analyses were performed
using SAS Enterprise Guide, version 6.1, and SAS, version 9.4
(both from SAS Institute). All the P values were 2-sided. P val-
ues less than .05 were considered statistically significant.
Results
Study Population
Individual residency program data are displayed in eTable 1 in
the Supplement. Only 1 out of the 10 residency programs re-
quired in-person sign out at the time of rotation-to-rotation
transition, whereas the other 9 used written and verbal sign
out. Program-specific end-of-rotation sign out processes were
reported to be similar at the VA compared with other hospi-
tals where house staff rotated. Individual hospital census and
house staff switch schedules varied, but 90% of programs re-
ported the presence of a formal handoff education program
(eTable 1 in the Supplement).
The main study cohorts included 230 701 patient dis-
charges, of which 25 938 (11.2%) were exposed to intern-only
transition, 26 456 (11.5%) were exposed to resident-only tran-
sition, and 11 517 (5.0%) were exposed to intern + resident
transition (Table 1). Among them, 95.8% were men with a
mean age of 65.6 years. Mean length of stay was 4.2 days (SD,
4.7; with outliers >99th percentile [>33days] excluded) with

a median of 3.0 days (interquartile-range [IQR], 1.0-5.0).
Median length of stay was greater for transition patients than
controls by 3 days for both the intern-only group (5.0 [IQR, 3.0-
9.0] for transition vs 2.0 [IQR, 1.0-5.0] for control) and the resi-

(6.0 [IQR, 4.0-10.0] for transition vs 2.0 [IQR, 1.0-5.0] for con-
trol). Baseline characteristics including comorbidities are
outlined in Table 1.
The alternative analyses included 14 669 admissions in the
intern-onlytransitiongroup,15 068admissionsintheresident-
only transition group, and 4729 admissions in the in-
tern + resident transition group. Baseline characteristics were
similar between groups, with no significant differences in
length of stay (eTable 2 in the Supplement). Because the al-
ternativeanalysisgroupsweredefinedbyadmissiondaterather
than transition in care, there was crossover between groups.
A total of 5652 patients (38.5%) in the intern-only transition
group, 5883 patients (39.0%) in the resident-only transition
group, and 2231 patients (47.2%) in the intern + resident tran-
sition group were discharged or died prior to transition and did
not experience a transition in care. Conversely, among the con-
trols, 703 patients (4.8%) in the intern only group, 772 pa-
tients (5.1%) in the resident only group, and 216 patients (4.5%)
in the intern + resident group remained in the hospital long
enough to experience a transition in care (eTable 3 in the
Supplement). There was also incomplete overlap between the
2 analytic groups, with only 59% to 66% of alternative analy-
sis transition patients being represented in the main analysis

consistently greater for patients undergoing transition with-
out any apparent outliers and with only 1 program not reach-
ing statistical significance at any level of transition. Single-
center–adjusted in-hospital mortality was similarly greater for
many hospitals, but statistical significance varied.

Mortality rates from the alternative analyses, including in-
hospital, 30-day, and 90-day mortality rates are shown in
Table 3. There were no statistically significant differences be-
tween transition and control groups for in-hospital, 30-day, or
90-day mortality rates.
Readmission Rates
Adjusted 30-day and 90-day readmission rates from both the
main analyses (Table 2) and alternative analyses (Table 3) were
not significantly different for any comparison.
Duty Hour Regulations
As shown in Table 4, adjusted hospital mortality for all tran-
sition groups (intern only, resident only, and intern + resi-
dent) before duty hour regulations was not significantly dif-
ferent than controls. However, adjusted hospital mortality was
significantly greater in both the intern-only and in-
tern + residenttransitiongroupscomparedwithcontrolsinthe
period after duty hour regulations (intern only: 3.3% vs 1.8%;
OR, 1.16 [95% CI, 1.08-1.25], P < .001; intern + resident: 3.7%
vs 1.8%; OR, 1.24 [95% CI, 1.11-1.39], P < .001).
When these associations were tested using difference-in-
differences analyses (Table 4), mortality rates for intern-only
and intern + resident transition patients worsened compared
with controls following duty hour regulations (intern only: OR,
1.11 [95% CI, 1.02-1.21], P < .05; intern + resident: OR, 1.17 [95%
CI, 1.02-1.34], P < .05).
Alternative analysis results regarding duty hour period
comparisons are presented in Table 4. These results were not
statistically significant for any comparison before or after the
implementation of duty hour regulations.
Discussion
In the main analysis of this large multicenter study, hospital-
ized medical patients exposed to end-of-rotation house staff
transition in care experienced an absolute increase of 1.5% to
1.9% in unadjusted in-hospital mortality risk, and an ad-
justedORof1.12to1.18forin-hospitalmortalitycomparedwith
controlpatients.Furthermore,theadjustedORsfor30-dayand
90-day mortality were 1.10 to 1.21 for transition vs control pa-
tients for all types of transitions. The associations were stron-
ger following the institution of ACGME duty hour regula-
tions. There were no significant associations with readmission
rates. In contrast, the findings of the alternative analysis
showed no significant difference in mortality between hospi-
talized medical patients admitted just before end-of-rotation

transition and control patients admitted on the same days in
the middle of the rotation. Similarly, these groups were not sig-
nificantly different in 30-day and 90-day mortality or read-
mission rates. Together, these results showed that end-of-
rotation transitions in care were associated with increased
mortality;however,thisincreasedriskmaybelimitedtolonger-
stay, complex patients with greater comorbidities or those dis-
charged soon after the transition.
Physician transitions in care contribute to adverse pa-
tient events and outcomes,2,4,20 but studies have focused pre-
dominantlyonshift-to-shifthandofforhospitaldischarge.1,21-23
The results of this study suggest that end-of-rotation handoff
is a critical transition that deserves further attention. In 1994,
a study by Rich et al8 evaluated intern rotations, showing lon-
ger length of stay for intern transition patients but no associa-
tion with mortality or readmissions. In 2002, a study by
Smith et al6 evaluated end-of-the-month admissions, finding
a nonsignificant increase in length of stay without differ-
ences in mortality or in-hospital adverse events when com-
pared with middle-of-the-month admissions. More recently,
in 2015 a similar study compared mortality the week following
end-of-rotation transition in care with all other weeks at a large
urban medical center, observing an association between end-
of-rotation handoff and adjusted hospital mortality.7
There are a number of potential explanations for the dis-
cordant findings of mortality risk with end-of-rotation tran-
sitions between the 2 analyses. First, they included different
populations of patients. The main analysis included the ma-
jority of patients who experienced a transition, particularly
complex and long-stay patients. By contrast, the alternative
analysis included only patients admitted immediately prior to
transition, by definition excluding long-stay and potentially
more complex patients. It is therefore possible that transi-
tions in care increase the risk of mortality only for patients who
havealreadyhadacomplexhospitalcourseorprolongedlength
of stay. For these patients, incomplete information transfer

ful, increasing mortality risk.
Second, limitations of the alternative analysis may have
impaired its ability to demonstrate a mortality effect. The
smaller sample size of the alternative analysis reduced its
power and excluded many patients undergoing transition.
Additionally, it produced substantial crossover, such that
over a third of patients in the “transition” groups did not
actually experience a transition. Third, it is possible that the
definition of the analytic groups in the main analysis may
have created unmeasured confounding, as illustrated by the
substantial differences in the main analysis between the
exposure and control groups for length of stay and comorbid
conditions. Moreover, the increased length of stay in the
transition group may have produced greater opportunity for
in-hospital mortality. To mitigate these potential biases, the
analyses were adjusted for comorbidities and length of stay.
However, it is possible that the differences observed in
patient populations might represent a direct consequence of
clinical decisions made because of an upcoming transition
rather than confounding. That is, if clinicians try to discharge

as many patients as possible prior to transitioning off service,
but have more difficulty discharging complex and long-stay
patients, the average severity or complexity of patients
exposed to transitions in care could be increased. In addition,
disruptions from transitions in care may have delayed
patients’discharge and prolonged their length of stay. In that
case, the differences between groups in the main analysis
would not be bias, but a consequence of the transition.
The increased 30-day and 90-day mortality risks ob-
served in the main analysis suggest that the delayed dis-
chargeofthesecomplicatedpatientsfollowingtransitioncould
be detrimental. A reasonable explanation for these findings
could be communication failures that led to errors at dis-
charge or possibly another complication changing the trajec-
tory of the patient’
s prognosis after discharge. The alterna-
tive analysis, however, did not demonstrate these findings,
which could be related to the noted differences between analy-
ses. For example, the main analysis specifically evaluated pa-
tients discharged soon after transition whereas the alterna-
tive analysis measured patients admitted just prior to
transition, excluding those patients with longer stays before
transition who were likely the most at risk for misinforma-
tion transfer. The difference in patient population between
analyses is further demonstrated by the finding that only 59%
to66%ofalternativeanalysistransitionpatientswerealsocon-
sidered a transition patient in the main analysis.

hourrestrictions,whichprimarilyaffectedinterns,eventhough
studies have found that duty hour regulations may not be
harmful14,27-29 and may be associated with benefit.30,31 The im-
portance of intern transitions may be attributable to a number
offactors.First,internsperformamajorityoftheday-to-daywork
of a medical team. They gather, maintain, and transfer the ma-
jority of day-to-day information for hospitalized patients, but
they are also the most inexperienced residents, increasing the
risk for misinformation transfer and potential errors. Because
2011dutyhourregulationsprimarilylimitedinternhours,12shift-
to-shift handoffs have increased noticeably,13 prompting a pro-
spective trial of medical residencies.32
Second, for residency programs to comply with the duty
hour regulations, interns now rotate on shorter “night-float”
rotation schedules, in contrast with longer 24-hour call
schedules.15 As a result, the proportion of residents taking
handoffs for new patients each block has likely increased cor-
respondingly. This change in day-to-night continuity exposes
patientseachmonthtoanewteamofphysiciansduringtheday
and at night, when previously they would have only 1 team of
physicians taking 24-hour call. Third, interns are now ex-
pected to complete the same tasks in less time than in the past,
leaving them with limited time to prepare for service change.
Although research has shown that medical errors were re-
duced when interns worked shorter shifts,33 the present find-
ingssuggestthatcurrenttoolsandschedulestostandardizeend-
of-rotation transition may need to evolve, particularly because
only 1 of 10 surveyed programs in this study required in-
person sign out at the time of rotation-to-rotation transition.
Thisstudyhasadditionallimitations.First,VAmedicalcen-
tersincludeapatientpopulationmadeuppredominantlyofolder
menwithmultiplecomorbidities.Nonetheless,theincludedpro-
grams indicated that end-of-rotation sign out processes were
similar at the VA compared with the other hospitals through
whichhousestaffrotated.Theanalysisdidnotaccountforother
clinicians,suchasattendingphysicians,physicianassistants,or
nurse practitioners, but only programs in which these clini-
cianshadadifferentrotationschedulefromthehousestaffwere
included to minimize potential bias. Although the number of
non–internal medicine house staff that rotated on medical ser-
vicescouldnotbequantified,end-of-rotationtransitionswould
not be expected to differ. Certain handoff dates for 3 of the resi-
dencyprogramswereunavailable;therefore,thesemissingyears
were omitted from each hospital’
s respective data set prior to
analysis. Non–teaching service patients could not be excluded
at some of the included hospitals. These patients were covered
by nonrotating clinicians without monthly rotating residents.
However,thiswouldlikelyleadtoaconservativebiasthatwould
be expected to dilute any true effect. Other limitations include
theretrospective,observationaldesign;thatthesecomparedco-
horts may have differed in important ways not accounted for,
such as socioeconomic status; and the unavailability of data on

of education provided at each program.
Conclusions
Amongpatientsadmittedtointernalmedicineservicesin10Vet-

associated with significantly higher in-hospital mortality in an
