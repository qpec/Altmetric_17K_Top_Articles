abstract
OBJECTIVE: To determine the impact of a baby-led approach to complementary feeding on 
infant choking and gagging.
METHODS: Randomized controlled trial in 206 healthy infants allocated to control (usual care) 
or Baby-Led Introduction to SolidS (BLISS; 8 contacts from antenatal to 9 months providing 
resources and support). BLISS is a form of baby-led weaning (ie, infants feed themselves 
all their food from the beginning of complementary feeding) modified to address concerns 
about choking risk. Frequencies of choking and gagging were collected by questionnaire 
(at 6, 7, 8, 9, 12 months) and daily calendar (at 6 and 8 months); 3-day weighed diet records 
measured exposure to foods posing a choking risk (at 7 and 12 months).
RESULTS: A total of 35% of infants choked at least once between 6 and 8 months of age, and 
there were no significant group differences in the number of choking events at any time 
(all Ps > .20). BLISS infants gagged more frequently at 6 months (relative risk [RR] 1.56; 
95% confidence interval [CI], 1.13–2.17), but less frequently at 8 months (RR 0.60; 95% CI, 
0.42–0.87), than control infants. At 7 and 12 months, 52% and 94% of infants were offered 
food posing a choking risk during the 3-day record, with no significant differences between 
groups (7 months: RR 1.12; 95% CI, 0.79–1.59; 12 months: RR 0.94; 95% CI, 0.83–1.07).
CONCLUSIONS: Infants following a baby-led approach to feeding that includes advice on 
minimizing choking risk do not appear more likely to choke than infants following more 
traditional feeding practices. However, the large number of children in both groups offered 
foods that pose a choking risk is concerning.

WHAT’S KNOWN ON THIS SUBJECT: Although baby-
led approaches to infant feeding, in which infants 
feed themselves all their foods from the start of 
complementary feeding, are increasingly popular, 
concern has been expressed that this alternative 
feeding approach may increase the risk of food-
related choking.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: Infants following a 
modifi
 ed version of baby-led weaning did not choke 
more often than infants following traditional 
feeding practices, suggesting baby-led approaches 
to introducing solids can be as safe as traditional 
methods. However, unsafe practices were apparent 
in both groups.

Complementary feeding usually 
starts with puréed foods that are 
spoon-fed to the infant. 
1 
– 
3 However, 
an alternative approach, called 
baby-led weaning (BLW), appears to 
be growing in popularity. 
4 In BLW, 
infants feed themselves all their 
foods, in the form of graspable pieces, 
from the start of complementary 
feeding.5 Although BLW has several 
proposed advantages, 
 
6, 
 
7 concern has 
been expressed about the safety of 
baby-led approaches, particularly 
whether they may increase the risk 
of food-related choking. 
8, 
 
9 Advocates 
of BLW suggest that choking is 
no more likely than in spoon-fed 
infants, providing basic safety rules 
are followed (eg, infant is seated in 
an upright position and in control 
of what is put in his or her mouth), 
although gagging may be more 
common.5, 
 
6
Despite considerable interest in BLW 
from health professionals, parents, 
and policymakers, 
 
4, 
 
10 only 2 small 
studies have investigated whether 
baby-led approaches increase the 
risk of choking. 
11, 
 
12 Analysis of 
3-day diet records indicated that 
BLW infants were not offered foods 
posing a choking risk more often than 
infants following traditional spoon-
feeding, but the small sample size and 
wide confidence interval (CI) suggest 
caution in interpreting the data.11 A 
small survey reported no difference 
in the proportion of infants who had 
ever choked (31% in traditionally fed 
infants, 31%–40% in BLW), but the 
study was not powered to identify 
differences in choking. 
12
The Baby-Led Introduction to SolidS 
(BLISS) study was designed primarily 
to determine whether a modified 
version of BLW was a suitable obesity 
prevention initiative in infancy. 
13 
Because the BLISS modifications 
specifically addressed choking risk, 
the aim of the current study was to 
determine whether this modified 
baby-led approach to complementary 
feeding altered the risk of choking 
and gagging in infants compared with 
traditional spoon-feeding.
METHODS
BLISS was a 2-year randomized 
controlled trial (commenced 2013), 
approved by the New Zealand Lower 
South Regional Ethics Committee 
(LRS/11/09/037). Because a 
detailed protocol 
13 and pilot study 
14 
have been published, only relevant 
information is provided here. 
Pregnant women were eligible if they 
booked with the local maternity unit 
before 34 weeks’ gestation, were 
≥16 years of age, spoke English or 
Te Reo Māori (indigenous language 
of New Zealand), and planned to live 
locally for the next 2 years. Exclusion 
criteria applied after birth were 
prematurity (birth before 37 weeks’ 
gestation; n = 18) or identification 
of a congenital abnormality or 
disability likely to affect feeding or 
growth (n = 8). Eligible volunteers 
(n = 206) were randomly assigned to 
control or BLISS groups with random 
length blocks, after stratification 
for parity (first, subsequent child) 
and education (tertiary degree or 
diploma: yes, no). All outcome data 
were collected by research staff 
blinded to group allocation.
All families received free well 
child health care, available to all 
New Zealand children from birth 
to 5 years of age, which typically 
involves 8 visits before 12 months 
of age and endorses conventional 
complementary feeding methods. 
1, 
 
15 
Participants in the BLISS group 
received 8 additional group or 
individual parent contacts (delivered 
face to face or by telephone) for 
education and support regarding the 
BLISS approach to complementary 
feeding (5 contacts with an 
international board certified lactation 
consultant from antenatal to 5 
months, and 3 home visits from a 
research assistant trained in the 
BLISS approach at 5.5, 7, and 9 
months of age). Additional support 
was available when requested. 
Parents were strongly encouraged 
to delay the introduction of 
complementary foods to 6 months 
16, 
 
17 
(so that infants were able to sit 
upright and feed themselves safely 
when they started solids) and to 
allow the infant to feed themselves 
all their complementary foods from 6 
months. Intervention messages about 
minimizing the risk of food-related 
choking (Fig 1) were developed 
with a pediatric speech–language 
therapist and discussed in detail at 
the 5.5-month postpartum home 
visit. A booklet, Safety When Starting 
Food, that was discussed at this visit 
included information on how to 
recognize and manage choking and 
gagging (Supplemental Information), 
and how to provide cardiopulmonary 
resuscitation if necessary (developed 
in consultation with the Order of St 
John: http:// 
www. 
stjohn. 
org. 
nz/ 
).
Outcome Measurements
Questionnaires
Demographic variables collected at 
baseline (third trimester) included 
maternal self-reported prepregnancy 
weight and height, parity, education, 
age at child’s birth, ethnicity, and 
household deprivation. 
18 Infant sex 
and birth weight were obtained 
from hospital records. Age when 
complementary foods were 
introduced was determined at 2, 
4, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 12 months of age. 
Choking (a piece of food partially 
or completely blocking the airway, 
affecting breathing) and gagging 
(a reflex closing off the throat and 
pushing the tongue to the front 
of the mouth) were assessed by 
questionnaire when infants were 
6, 7, 8, 9, and 12 months of age 
(primary outcome). These questions 
assessed the frequency of choking 
and gagging over the past month 
(or since birth for the 6-month 
questionnaire). Parents of children 
who had experienced food-related 
choking in the past month were 
asked additional questions about

the event they thought was the most 
serious: symptoms, who resolved 
the choking, the food, what form it 
was fed in, and who fed the child. 
Parental supervision of infant eating 
was assessed in the 7-, 8-, 9-, and 
12-month questionnaires. Adherence 
to the BLISS intervention was defined 
as infants feeding themselves most or 
all of their food in the previous week 
in the 7-month questionnaire.
Calendars
To minimize recall bias, parents 
completed two 4-week calendars 
when their infant was 6 and 8 months 
of age, indicating each day whether 
the infant had gagged or choked 
(providing “yes” or “no” responses to 
differentiate between absence of an 
event and missing data).
Weighed Diet Records
Parents completed weighed diet 
records on 3 randomly assigned, 
nonconsecutive days (2 weekdays, 
1 weekend day) over 3 weeks when 
the infants were 7 and 12 months 
of age. 
13 Information was obtained 
on the form of each item consumed 
(liquid, puréed, mashed, diced 
[chopped into small pieces, needing 
a spoon to eat], sliced, and whole [in 
its original shape, or cut into more 
manageable pieces, eg, toast fingers]) 
and on who fed the food to the infant. 
We developed a list of foods to 
assess infant exposure to foods that 
posed a choking risk (Supplemental 
Table 4). The list was based on our 
pilot study 
14 and updated according 
to recent New Zealand Ministry of 
Health 
18 and American Academy of 
Pediatrics guidelines. 
19, 
20 A pediatric 
speech–language therapist made 
additional modifications.
Statistical Analysis
Statistical analyses were undertaken 
with Stata 13 (Stata Corp, College 
Station, TX). Throughout, months 
refer to whole months unless stated 
otherwise, so that “8 months” refers 
to 8.0 to 8.9 months of age. The 
BLISS study was powered to detect 
differences in the primary outcome 
(infant BMI) rather than choking, a 
secondary outcome. 
13
The data were analyzed according to 
modified intention to treat. Poisson 
regression with robust SEs compared 
the number of children who choked 
and gagged, and the number of 
children offered foods posing a 
choking risk, in the BLISS and 
control groups. 
21 Negative binomial 
regression compared the number 
of gagging events per infant in the 2 
groups (by using relative risks [RRs] 
with 95% CIs).
The 129 parent-defined most serious 
choking episodes are described in 
detail in the supplemental tables. 
Infants were also divided into 4 
groups according to adherence to a 
baby-led approach to infant feeding: 
not baby-led (always or mostly 
fed by an adult), partially baby-led 
(approximately half fed by an adult 
and half self-fed), baby-led (always or 
mostly self-fed), and not yet started 
solids. Because the numbers were 
small, no statistical tests were carried 
out on these sets of data.
RESULTS
Between December 2012 and March 
2014, 206 eligible families agreed 
to participate (23% response rate; 
 
Fig 2). Retention was high, with 
184 families (89%) remaining 
at 12 months. Mothers were 
predominantly European (82%) 
and well educated, and fewer had 
high levels of household deprivation 
(21%) than is observed nationally 
(30%) 
22 ( 
Table 1). At 7 months 
of age, 73% of BLISS infants had 
followed a baby-led approach to 
infant feeding for the past week (ie, 
adherent to BLISS), compared with 
19% of controls. Significantly more 
BLISS (65%) than control (18%) 
infants waited until 6 months of age 
before starting solids (P < .01).
The number of children who choked 
did not differ significantly between 
the groups at any age ( 
Table 2). 
Complete questionnaire data were 
provided for 170 infants at 6, 7, 
and 8 months of age, 59 of whom 
choked at least once (35%). Most 
of the infants who choked in any 
given month (68% at 8 months to

77% at 7 months) only did so once 
or twice that month, although 1 
BLISS participant choked 8 times at 
6 months (choking only once more in 
the next 3 months).
In total, 8114 gagging episodes were 
reported (from birth to 8 months and 
at 11 months of age). Significantly 
more BLISS infants gagged at least 
once at 6 months (questionnaire 
and calendar;  
Table 2), and BLISS 
infants also gagged more frequently 
at 6 months of age, compared with 
controls (RR 1.56; 95% CI, 1.13–2.17; 
 
Table 3). However, BLISS infants 
gagged less frequently than control 
infants at 8 months (RR 0.60; 95% CI, 
0.42–0.87).
At 7 months of age, 85 (52%) infants 
were offered a food posing a choking 
risk at least once during the 3-day 
weighed diet record (Supplemental 
Table 5), rising to 136 infants (94%) 
by 12 months (Supplemental Table 
6). No significant group differences 
were observed at either age in the 
total number of choking risk foods 
offered (7 months: RR 1.12; 95% CI, 
0.79–1.59; 12 months: RR 0.94; 95% 
CI, 0.83–1.07). The most commonly 
offered foods posing a choking risk 
are listed in Supplemental Tables 5 
and 6. At 7 months of age, this was 
teething rusks for both groups (14% 
to 19%), followed by hard crackers 
(13%, BLISS) and raw vegetables 
(13%, controls). At 12 months, hard 
crackers were the most commonly 
offered food posing a choking risk 
(47% and 48%).
In total, 199 choking events were 
reported in 894 questionnaires 
(from birth to 8 months and at 
11 months of age). Parents were 
asked to describe their infant’s 
“most serious” choking episode in 
the last month, providing detailed 
data on 129 of these 199 events 
(Supplemental Table 7). In many 
cases, only 1 event had occurred in 
a given month and was described as 
the most serious by default. Across 
both groups, the infant had fed 
themselves on 109 (84%) occasions, 
and food of “whole” consistency was 
involved on 75 (58%) occasions. The 
infant resolved the choking episode 
without assistance 51% of the time 
(Supplemental Table 7). A health 
professional became involved or the 
infant was admitted to hospital on 
only 3 occasions (2 BLISS, 1 control; 
2 involving milk, 1 involving a food 
placed in the child’s mouth by a 
parent). Of the foods responsible 
for the parent-defined most serious 
choking events (Supplemental Table 
8), only 23% were from our list of 
foods considered to pose a choking 
risk.
Because infants feeding themselves 
whole foods is the hallmark of a 
baby-led approach, and we did not 
achieve complete adherence in 
either the BLISS or control groups, 
we investigated whether the 
degree of adherence to a baby-led 
approach influenced choking risk. 
Supplemental Table 9 indicates that 
the proportion of infants who choked 
appeared broadly similar across the 
adherence categories at each age.
From 6 to 8 months of age, 71% 
(8 months) to 79% (6 months) of 
infants always had a parent or other 
adult sitting with them while they 
were eating, which did not differ 
between groups. However, at 11 
months of age infants in the BLISS 
group were twice as likely as control 
infants to have a parent or other 
adult sitting with them (65% vs 44%; 
RR 1.97; 95% CI, 1.09–3.56).
DISCUSSION
The BLISS approach to 
complementary feeding, which 
included specific advice to minimize 
the risk of food-related choking, did 
not appear to result in more choking 
events in the first year of life than 
were observed in the control group. 
However, half of all infants were 
offered ≥1 food posing a choking 
risk during 3 days of diet recording 
at 7 months of age, which increased 
to nearly all infants at 12 months. 
Of the 129 parent-defined most 
serious choking episodes reported, 
only 23% of the foods involved were 
items from a list of foods considered 
to pose a choking risk. The majority 
of events occurred when the infants 
were feeding themselves whole 
foods, regardless of study group.

Gagging was reasonably common, 
with BLISS infants gagging more 
often than control infants at 6 
months of age but less often at 8 
months of age, presumably as they 
became more experienced at feeding 
themselves.
It is difficult to compare our findings 
because there have been so few 
studies. It is also important to note 
that our intervention used a modified 
version of BLW. The modified 
version strongly encouraged delaying 
complementary feeding until 6 
months of age and provided written 
and verbal messages specifically 
designed to reduce food-related 
choking. Our observation that BLISS 
did not increase the risk of choking 
relative to more traditional feeding 
methods should not be extrapolated 
to unmodified versions of BLW. The 
only existing data on choking in 
BLW come from our BLISS research 
group, a small survey reporting 
similar “ever” choking rates of 31% 
to 40% in BLW infants and 31% in 
conventionally fed infants. 
12
There are a number of possible 
explanations for infants so frequently 
being offered foods that pose a 
choking risk. Parents receive a wealth 
of information in the first year of 
their child’s life, 
 
15 and it is possible 
that messages about food-related 
choking are overshadowed by other 
topics such as breastfeeding and 
safe sleeping practices or that the 
information is not easily applied. 
Advice on modifying foods that pose 
a choking risk may be beneficial, 
especially where healthful foods 
(eg, raw vegetables) are involved, 
because parents may not want to 
limit these foods in their infant’s 
diet or in shared meals. Advice to 
avoid raw apple may be particularly 
important because previous BLW 
research indicated it was the food 
most commonly associated with 
choking. 
8 Our diet record data are 
reassuring in that this advice was 
generally adhered to in BLISS, with 
only 1 infant offered raw apple at 
7 months of age, compared with 11 
control infants.
Our finding that only 23% of the 
foods responsible for the 129 
food-related choking episodes 
described by parents were items 
from our list of foods posing a 
choking risk may lead to questions 
about the comprehensiveness of 
the list. However, it was based on 
material from a range of literature, 
with additional development by 
experienced pediatric speech–
language therapists. Rather, our 
findings indicate that infants can 
choke on a wide variety of foods and 
liquids, so it will not be possible to 
prevent all food-related choking, 
regardless of feeding method. Our 
results also suggest that the severity, 
and therefore clinical importance, 
of the choking events reported 
varied. For example, it is likely that 
the 51 episodes resolved by the 
infant alone have limited clinical 
importance compared with the 
3 choking episodes where health 
professionals became involved. Two 
of these 3 events were unrelated to 
the intervention because they were 
hospital admissions resulting from 
choking on milk rather than solid 
foods. The third event involved a 
BLISS parent placing a piece of food 
directly in the infant’s mouth, which 
contradicted BLISS guidelines ( 
Fig 1). 
It is therefore important that parents 
who follow baby-led approaches 
are given, understand, and 
implement safety advice (eg,  
Fig 1).

Furthermore, close supervision of all 
infant eating occasions (regardless 
of the method of infant feeding) is of 
paramount importance so that any 
unavoidable episodes of choking 
can be identified and managed 
promptly. 
1, 
 
23, 
24 The majority of 
choking episodes occurred during 
infant self-feeding of whole foods, 
although there was no evidence 
that following a baby-led approach 
increased the risk of choking 
itself. However, it is important to 
remember that the majority of infants 
who adhered to a baby-led approach 
were in the BLISS group and so had 
received specific advice to decrease 
their risk of choking.
The BLISS study is the first 
randomized controlled trial to 
investigate the safety of a baby-led 
approach to infant feeding. Strengths 
include the use of multiple methods 
of measurement and repeated 
careful assessment. However, there 
were also some limitations. It is 
possible that some misclassifications 
of choking episodes occurred 
because they were parent-defined. 
However, considerable efforts 
were made to ensure that parents 
clearly understood the differences 
between gagging and choking, and 
117 (92%) of the 127 episodes of 
choking directly observed by a parent 
included ≥1 indication of airway 
compromise (“coughed, 
” “gasped, 
” 
or “went silent”), suggesting that 
overall misclassification was low. 
Although recall bias was possible 
in the retrospective questionnaires, 
comparable data were collected 
from the daily calendars, suggesting 
that recall of choking and gagging 
was accurate ( 
Table 2). Because 
the study was powered to detect 
differences in infant BMI rather than 
choking, we had insufficient power to 
determine whether the rates of the 
most clinically significant choking 
events (necessitating medical 
intervention) differed by group. We 
also recognize that the response rate 
to the study was low (23% of eligible 
Dunedin births), and the sample was 
socioeconomically advantaged, which 
may limit extrapolation to other 
populations.
CONCLUSIONS
Infants following a version of BLW 
modified to address concerns about 
choking did not appear to choke 
more often than other infants, 
suggesting that baby-led approaches 
to complementary feeding can be 
as safe as traditional spoon-feeding 
methods. However, high proportions 
of infants in both groups were 
offered foods posing a choking risk, 
infants were not consistently closely 
supervised while eating, and a small 
number of serious choking events 
were observed in both study groups. 
Although it would be wise to include 
the advice tested in the BLISS study 
in any specific advisories for parents 
following baby-led approaches, it

is also clear that regardless of the 
method of complementary feeding, 
more work is needed to ensure that 
parents and caregivers know how 
to provide safe foods and feeding 
environments, and it is essential that 
parents are taught how to deal with 
unavoidable choking episodes.

Lisa Gallacher (BSLT [Hons]) and 
Siobhan McKinlay (BSLT [Hons]), 
pediatric speech–language therapists 
from CARA Community Assessment 
Rehabilitation Associates (Dunedin, 
New Zealand), provided advice on 
foods posing a choking risk in 6- to 
12-month-olds and appropriate 
texture modification, and they 
checked all the BLISS resources to 
ensure that the advice did not pose 
a choking risk. We are grateful to 
all families who participated in 
the BLISS study and to the BLISS 
research staff in the Department of 
Human Nutrition at the University 
of Otago, particularly Jenny
