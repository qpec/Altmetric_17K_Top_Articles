abstract
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Postconcussive and co-occurring psychological symptoms are not 
uncommon after sports-related concussion and are associated with functional impairment 
and societal costs. There is no evidence-based treatment targeting postconcussive 
symptoms in children and adolescents. The goal of this study was to test a collaborative 
care intervention model with embedded cognitive–behavioral therapy, care management, 
and psychopharmacological consultation. We hypothesized that patients in collaborative 
care would demonstrate greater reductions in postconcussive, depressive, and anxiety 
symptoms and improvement in functioning over the course of 6 months, compared with 
usual care control.
METHODS: Patients aged 11 to 17 years with persistent symptoms ≥1 month after sports-
related concussion were randomly assigned to receive collaborative care (n = 25) or care as 
usual (n = 24). Patients were assessed before randomization and after 1, 3, and 6 months. 
Groups were compared over time via linear mixed effects regression models.
RESULTS: Adolescents assigned to collaborative care experienced clinically and statistically 
significant improvements in postconcussive symptoms in addition to functional gains at 
6 months compared with controls. Six months after the baseline assessment, 13.0% of 
intervention patients and 41.7% of control patients reported high levels of postconcussive 
symptoms (P = .03), and 78% of intervention patients and 45.8% of control patients 
reported ≥50% reduction in depression symptoms (P = .02). No changes between groups 
were demonstrated in anxiety symptoms.
CONCLUSIONS: Orchestrated efforts to systematically implement collaborative care treatment 
approaches for slow-to-recover adolescents may be useful given the reductions in 
postconcussive and co-occurring psychological symptoms in addition to improved quality 
of life.

WHAT’S KNOWN ON THIS SUBJECT: Persistent 
postconcussive symptoms confer signifi
 cant impairment in a 
subset of youth after concussion. Co-occurring psychological 
symptoms are common and may prolong recovery. Lack of 
empirical data in support of treatment of postconcussive 
symptoms places the clinician in a challenging position.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: Adolescents with persistent 
postconcussive symptoms who received collaborative care, 
including integrated care management and cognitive–
behavioral therapy, displayed a signifi
 cant reduction in 
postconcussive symptoms and functional improvement after 
6 months as compared with adolescents in usual care.

Sports-related concussions have 
galvanized the American public and 
represent an important public health 
problem, especially for children and 
adolescents. Although symptomatic 
recovery is typically reached within 
2 weeks of concussive injury, an 
estimated 13.7% of school-aged 
youth remain symptomatic at 3 
months. 
1 Over time, refractory 
headache, fatigue, dizziness, and 
inattention can confer significant 
functional impairment including 
executive dysfunction and poor 
academic performance. 
2 
– 
4 Affective 
symptoms, including depression and 
anxiety, commonly co-occur with 
cognitive and somatic symptoms 
and may prolong recovery from 
postconcussive symptoms, as has 
been demonstrated in patients with 
traumatic brain injury and depressive 
symptoms.5 
 
 
– 
9 Although it is widely 
accepted that a variety of biological, 
psychological, and social factors 
together contribute to increased risk 
of protracted symptom duration, the 
etiology and trajectory of persistent 
postconcussive symptoms remain 
poorly understood.10 Taken together, 
the complexities of managing 
persistent postconcussive symptoms 
in conjunction with comorbid 
psychological symptoms create 
a significant burden for injured 
children and adolescents, their 
families, and schools. 
2, 
 
3, 
 
11
Current clinical paradigms emphasize 
education about the symptoms 
of concussion, anticipatory 
guidance around a gradual return 
to cognitive and physical activity, 
psychoeducation, and reassurance of 
a projected complete recovery. 
12 
 
– 
15 
These clinical strategies may be 
adequate for children at the time of 
acute symptom presentations but 
remain unsubstantiated by rigorous 
clinical trials.12, 
 
16 No evidence-based 
guidelines exist regarding care of 
youth with persistent symptoms (≥1 
month) from concussion. 
17 This lack 
of empirical data places the treating 
clinician in a challenging position 
where watchful waiting remains the 
key component of standard care, 
leaving a gap in active intervention 
options. 
18
Cognitive–behavioral therapy 
(CBT) has been recommended as 
a first-line treatment of persistent 
postconcussive symptoms based 
on studies with adults after 
concussion. 
13, 
 
19 Robust evidence has 
documented that CBT is effective 
in the treatment of adolescent 
depression, anxiety, and chronic 
pain. 
20, 
 
21 Psychopharmacological 
management of co-occurring mood 
disorders requires close coordination 
and collaboration between 
physicians with specialized clinical 
training and experience in traumatic 
brain injury and child psychiatry.22 
Zatzick et al 
23 previously 
established safety of psychotropic 
medication provision with proper 
supervision in adolescents with 
traumatic brain injury. However, 
CBT, care coordination, and 
psychopharmacological treatment 
have not yet been harnessed within 
a clinical intervention to target 
postconcussive symptoms and 
co-occurring depressive and anxiety 
symptoms. 
24, 
 
25
Collaborative care is a health care 
delivery model that integrates 
medical and behavioral health 
care for patients with chronic 
disorders in which both physical 
and psychological symptoms are 
present, such as sequelae related 
to traumatic brain injury. 
26, 
 
27 
Large-scale randomized clinical 
trials have established the 
effectiveness of collaborative care 
interventions that combine care 
management, CBT, and evidence-
based pharmacotherapy in treating 
pediatric and adult primary care 
patients with depressive, anxiety, and 
posttraumatic stress disorders. 
27 
–29 
Given the constellation of somatic, 
cognitive, sleep, and postconcussive 
symptoms, collaborative care may be 
ideal because it can facilitate linkages 
and coordination across pediatric 
primary care, subspecialist sports 
medicine and rehabilitation, and 
school-based service delivery sectors. 
However, no previous study has 
examined the efficacy of collaborative 
care treatment of postconcussive 
symptoms in adolescents.
The current investigation was 
a randomized controlled trial 
conducted among adolescents 
who reported persistent 
postconcussive symptoms after 
sports-related concussion. The 
study was designed to test whether 
receiving a CBT intervention 
embedded in a collaborative care 
treatment model would reduce 
postconcussive, anxiety, and 
depressive symptoms. We also 
hypothesized that intervention 
patients would demonstrate 
improved health-related quality of 
life. The intervention was designed 
as a stepped-care model whereby 
adolescents were first provided with 
care management and CBT; patients’ 
symptoms were monitored, and for 
those who remained symptomatic, 
psychopharmacologic consultation 
was made available.
METHODS
Design, Setting, and Participants
Participants were adolescents 
ages 11 to 17 years with sports- or 
recreation-related concussion. 
The sample was 65% female, with 
the following racial distribution: 
75.5% white, 14.3% other, 8.2% 
Asian or Pacific Islander, and 
2.0% black. Approximately 8% of 
the sample identified as Hispanic 
or Latino. All concussions were 
diagnosed by sports medicine or 
rehabilitation medicine specialists 
trained in concussion diagnosis and 
management. Informed consent and 
assent were obtained before data 
collection, and study procedures 
were approved by the Seattle 
Children’s Institutional Review 
Board. Recruitment occurred 
between October 2014 and July 2015.

During active recruitment, a research 
associate reviewed upcoming visits 
for patients with a sports-related 
concussion in the Sports Medicine 
and Rehabilitation Medicine 
Clinics at Seattle Children’s and 
the Sports Concussion Program 
at Harborview Medical Center, 
clinics that receive referrals from 
emergency and primary care 
physicians for management of 
postconcussive symptoms. If patients 
were symptomatic ≥1 month after 
the concussion, a research associate 
subsequently informed the family 
of the clinical trial and conducted 
an eligibility screening by phone. 
Parents were asked to assess 
the frequency of postconcussive 
symptoms their children experienced 
during the preceding week and the 
week before the injury by using 
the Health and Behavior Inventory 
(HBI). 
30 Patients were eligible to 
participate if they experienced an 
onset or increase in frequency of 
≥3 postconcussive symptoms after 
a concussion within the past year 
compared with preinjury parent 
report. Patients and ≥1 parent or 
guardian were required to be able 
to read and speak English and to 
live within commuting distance 
of the regional children’s hospital 
where assessments and treatment 
took place. Patients were excluded 
if they had sustained more severe 
brain injuries, as documented by 
any abnormalities demonstrated 
on computed tomography or MRI. 
Patients who were actively suicidal or 
abusing substances or who reported 
bipolar or psychotic disorders were 
also excluded. Patients with other 
preexisting psychological disorders 
were considered eligible.
Randomization
Randomization to collaborative or 
usual care treatment groups occurred 
in a 1:1 ratio according to random 
assignments that were computer 
generated by a study biostatistician. 
Patients were stratified by the 
frequency of postconcussive 
symptoms (0–21 vs 22–60) reported 
by their parent within the past week 
via the 20-item HBI. The cutoff of 
21 for stratification purposes was 
chosen based on a median split of 
HBI scores from a sample of youth 
with mild traumatic brain injury 
who had ≥3 symptoms, from data 
provided by the primary author of 
measure (K. Yeates, PhD, personal 
communication, 2014). Research 
associates conducting baseline and 
follow-up assessments were blinded 
to intervention or control group 
status. 
31 The unblinded care manager 
called families to inform them of their 
randomization assignment after the 
baseline assessment.
Collaborative Care Intervention
Patients randomly assigned to 
the intervention received care 
management, CBT, and possible 
psychopharmacological consultation 
over the course of the 6-month 
treatment period. Intervention 
patients were treated for the 
duration of their symptoms, and 
treatment was terminated upon 
symptom resolution or at the end of 
the 6-month follow-up. Modular CBT 
targeting postconcussive depressive 
and anxiety symptoms was delivered 
by 1 of 5 study therapists (4 PhD-
level psychologists and 1 licensed 
therapist). CBT focused on techniques 
to encourage increased appropriate 
activation, including pacing of 
activities and the use of coping skills, 
relaxation strategies, sleep hygiene, 
and positive thinking in the face of 
symptoms. Health care coordination 
needs were carried out by the care 
manager, who communicated with 
the consulting psychiatrist, primary 
care physicians, and subspecialists 
to ensure that individual physical, 
psychological health, and health 
care–related concerns were actively 
addressed. Care management also 
included advocacy and coordination 
with the patient’s school regarding 
accommodations and motivational 
interviewing to maintain engagement 
in treatment. A multidisciplinary 
case conference included a 
bachelors-level care manager (E.S.), 
a supervising CBT interventionist 
(C.A.M.), a pediatrician (F.P.R.), 
and a supervising MD psychiatrist 
skilled in the postinjury collaborative 
care model (D.Z.); this team met 
weekly to discuss patients randomly 
assigned to the intervention 
condition. An expert in pediatric 
psychopharmacology (R.H.) provided 
pharmacologic consultation in 
cases of severe or recalcitrant 
symptoms that did not respond to 
psychotherapy when warranted at 
any time in treatment.
Usual Care Control Condition
Adolescent patients and their parents 
in the control condition underwent 
the baseline and follow-up 
assessments at 1, 3, and 6 months 
after enrollment. They received usual 
care organized by the referring clinic 
concussion specialist. Usual care 
in our system consisted of a visit 
initially to a sports medicine trained 
physician. For youth who were 
symptomatic beyond 4 to 6 weeks, 
patients were referred to pediatric 
rehabilitation medicine. They 
also usually underwent MRI, with 
diffuse tensor imaging sequences, 
and testing by a neuropsychologist. 
Patients having difficulty with 
sleep were usually prescribed a 
hypnotic medication, and patients 
may have also been provided with 
a subthreshold exercise program 
by a physical therapist. Usual care 
was documented by reviewing the 
medical chart and parent report 
of health care utilization outside 
the hospital over the course of the 
6-month study.
Measures
The following set of measures 
captured the degree of adolescent 
physical and psychological 
impairment present at baseline and

MCCARTY et al 
1, 3, and 6 months, based on both 
youth and parent report.
Primary Outcome Measures
Postconcussive Symptoms
The HBI was administered to 
both youth and parents to assess 
the presence of postconcussive 
symptoms. The HBI is a 20-item 
questionnaire that assesses 
postconcussive symptoms on a 
4-point scale, ranging from “never” 
to “often, 
” and yields total scores 
in cognitive and somatic domains, 
with higher scores indicating more 
symptomatic patients. The scale 
includes youth-report and parent-
report versions with established 
reliability and validity in youth with 
sports injury. 
30, 
 
32
Depressive Symptoms
The Patient Health Questionnaire 
(PHQ-9), which includes 9 questions 
based on Diagnostic and Statistical 
Manual of Mental Disorders, 
Fourth Edition major depression 
criteria, was administered to 
assess depressive symptoms. 
33 
It has been found to have high 
sensitivity (89.5%) and acceptable 
specificity (73%) for the diagnosis 
of major depression in adolescent 
populations. 
34Anxiety Symptoms
The PROMIS-PA8 (version a) asks 
about the frequency of 8 anxiety 
symptoms over the preceding 7 days 
on a 5-point scale, with higher scores 
indicating more symptoms. The scale 
includes youth-reported and parent-
reported versions with established 
validity and reliability among 
adolescents. 
35 
– 
37Health-Related 
Quality of Life
The Pediatric Quality of Life 
Inventory (PedsQL) is a 23-item 
questionnaire that assesses 
physical, emotional, social, and 
school functioning, with higher 
scores indicating greater quality 
of life. 
38 The scale includes youth-
reported and parent-reported 
versions with demonstrated validity 
and reliability, including good 
to excellent internal consistency 
(Cronbach’s α = 0.88 for child and 
0.90 for parent report). 
38 
 
–41 It has 
successfully been used in youth 
traumatic brain injury research 
previously. 
42 A 4- or 5-point 
difference is clinically meaningful. 
39
Secondary Outcome Measure
Satisfaction With Care
An item from the Client Satisfaction 
Questionnaire assessed satisfaction 
with care: “In an overall, general 
sense, how satisfied are you with 
the care you/your child have 
received?” 
43Other Measures
A medical chart review at the end of 
the study follow-up period provided 
demographic and health care 
utilization information. Additional 
mental health care utilization 
throughout the course of enrollment 
was also assessed in a questionnaire 
administered to both treatment 
groups.
Statistical Analyses
Moderate to large effect sizes have 
been observed in a general sample of 
youth with mild to severe traumatic 
brain injury. 
44 We calculated that 
a sample size of 40 would provide 
adequate power to observe a large 
treatment effect (partial η2 = 0.14). 
In the current study, we recruited 
49 adolescents to compensate for 
potential dropouts.
We used t tests and χ2 analyses to 
compare groups at baseline, using 
P < .05 as our threshold for statistical 
significance. To determine whether 
patients in the 2 groups manifested 
different patterns of change in 
symptoms and functioning over 
the 6 months after enrollment, we 
used linear mixed effects regression 
models. 
45, 
 
46 For all dependent 
variables, we fit models containing 
time categories (baseline, 1 month, 
3 months, and 6 months), treatment 
group, and treatment group by 
time interactions. The final models 
presented include no covariates 
given the sample size. All outcome 
analyses were intent-to-treat 
and used continuous variables. 
Effect sizes were calculated with 
Cohen’s d. 
47 Relative risk ratios 
were calculated to compare 
collaborative care and usual care 
groups with respect to high levels 
of postconcussive symptoms and 
depression symptom response. We 
conducted χ2 analyses to examine 
differences between groups in 
treatment satisfaction.
RESULTS
A total of 49 adolescents (mean 
age = 15.0 years) enrolled in the 
study. Adolescents randomly 
assigned to the intervention 
and control conditions were not 
statistically different with regard to 
demographic variables, preinjury 
health concerns, or clinical profiles 
at baseline, as indicated with 
dichotomized variables ( 
Table 1). 
A total of 57.5% of the adolescents 
incurred sports-related concussion, 
and 42.5% sustained recreation-
related concussion (eg, being hit 
by a ball on the playground, 
trampoline injury), with a higher 
proportion of youth assigned 
to collaborative care sustaining 
sports concussions (P = .03). 
The investigation attained >98% 
follow-up of the participants at 1, 3, 
and 6 months ( 
Fig 1).
Intervention Implementation
Of the 25 patients randomly assigned 
to the intervention, 23 completed 
the full course of collaborative 
care treatment over 6 months (1 
withdrew from treatment before 
initiating treatment and remained 
in the study, 1 withdrew from the 
study). The median number of CBT 
sessions received was 8 (range 
0–12); 88% of patients received 
≥4 sessions. One-third of patients 
received stepped-up care in the form 
of psychopharmacologic consultation 
and subsequent medication. Patients 
receiving collaborative care on

average had 6.2 (SD = 4.6) outpatient 
concussion-related visits (ie, sports 
medicine, rehabilitation medicine, 
neurology).
Usual Care
Among 24 patients assigned to 
the control condition, 8% saw a 
psychiatrist, 33% reported visits 
with a mental health professional, 
58% sought treatment from their 
primary care physician, and 21% 
sought treatment from another 
physician. Patients receiving usual 
care on average had 5.8 (SD = 2.3) 
outpatient concussion-related 
visits, including sports medicine, 
rehabilitation medicine, neurology, 
and pain medicine visits (range 2–23 
visits).
Treatment Outcomes
Intervention patients had clinically 
and statistically significant 
improvements in postconcussive 
symptoms and health-related 
quality of life outcomes compared 
with controls ( 
Fig 2 and  
Table 
2). The overall group × time 
interaction term indicated more 
improvement in youth-reported 
postconcussive symptoms over time 
among intervention than control 
adolescents (d = 0.70). At 6 months 
after the baseline assessment 
13% of intervention patients 
and 41.7% of control patients 
reported high levels (HBI ≥ 22) of 
postconcussive symptoms (relative 
risk = 0.03). Statistically significant 
improvements in health-related 
quality of life were demonstrated 
by both child and parent report. 
For functional status at 6 months, 
PedsQL child report improved a 
mean of 27.7 in the intervention 
group and 17.8 for controls (mean 
difference, 9.8; 95% confidence 
interval [CI], 0.9 to 18.8), and by 
parent report PedsQL improved 
by 33.3 points in the intervention 
group and 19.3 in the control group 
(mean difference, 14.0; 95% CI, 
4.6 to 23.1).
A majority of intervention patients 
(78.3%) demonstrated >50% 
reduction in depressive symptoms, a 
metric used in previous collaborative 
care trials of treatment of depression 
in adolescents, 
 
29 compared with 
45.8% of patients in the usual 
care group (relative risk 1.71 
[1.05–2.79]). Depressive symptom 
outcomes demonstrated a pattern 
of symptomatic improvement 
for adolescents who received the 
collaborative care intervention 
compared with controls over time, 
although differences in frequency of 
symptoms between the 2 groups at 
6 months did not achieve statistical 
significance.
Adolescents who received 
collaborative care treatment and 
their parents reported high levels 
of satisfaction with care ( 
Table 3). 
A total of 82.6% of intervention 
patients were “very satisfied” with 
their care, as compared with 45.8% of 
patients in the control group (χ2[1] = 
6.9, P = .001). A total of 87% of 
parents of intervention patients and 
29.2% of parents of patients in the 
control group were “very satisfied” 
with care (χ2[1] = 16.0, P < .0001).

DISCUSSION
This study provides evidence of 
the effectiveness of a collaborative 
care intervention in reducing 
postconcussive symptoms in 
a sample of adolescents with 
prolonged recovery from sports-
related concussion. Although patients 
in both groups showed symptom 
reduction in the first 3 months, only 
those who received collaborative 
care demonstrated sustained 
improvements through 6 months of 
follow-up. The large effect size for 
postconcussive symptom reduction 
and quality-of-life improvement 
reported in the collaborative care 
group compared with the usual 
care group was greater than the 
mean effect size for integrated 
pediatric medical–behavioral health 
care interventions according to a 
recent meta-analysis. 
48 Parents 
of adolescents randomly assigned 
to collaborative care reported 
improvement in their children’s 
health-related quality of life that 
was concordant with that reported 
by adolescents. Adolescents 
who received the collaborative 
intervention were more satisfied 
with their treatment than those 
who received usual care, suggesting 
that this patient population is 
amenable to behavioral treatment 
and coordination services offered 
through care management.
A clinical profile of adolescents with 
a prolonged postconcussive recovery 
course emerged, indicating that on 
average patients were moderately 
depressed at baseline while 
displaying anxiety levels on par with 
mean population levels. At baseline, 
84% of enrolled patients reported 
high postconcussive symptoms, 
41% reported high depressive 
symptoms, and 8% reported high 
anxiety levels. Low levels of anxiety 
symptoms in the adolescent patient 
population consistent with the 
general population may have limited 
the power to detect significant 
treatment effects on anxiety 
outcomes. Clinically significant 
reduction in depressive symptoms 
was established at 6 months in the 
collaborative care intervention group 
as compared with patients receiving 
care as usual. No significant group 
differences were observed over time 
for anxiety or parental mental health.
This is the first randomized 
controlled treatment trial of a 
collaborative care intervention for 
persistent postconcussive symptoms 
in the pediatric population. An 
integrated, personalized treatment 
approach using a collaborative 
care model of health care delivery 
targeted the full range of postinjury 
symptoms and comorbidities 
through CBT and continuous case 
management services that included 
advocacy in the school setting as well 
as stepped-up care coordination and 
medication consultation to achieve 
symptom remission. Additional 
strengths of the study include use 
of a robust battery of measures that 
longitudinally tracked symptoms and 
impairment throughout a 6-month 
time period, and the high retention of 
participants.
There were also limitations to the 
study. The sample was small and 
drawn from a regional population, 
including a large proportion of 
Caucasian girls, which may limit 
generalizability. Adolescents were

enrolled in the study at variable 
times since injury, introducing 
heterogeneity of symptom duration. 
For this trial, we allowed patients to 
enroll at any point in their symptom 
trajectory (≥1 month) to reflect 
a real-world clinical population. 
Moreover, we used the PHQ-9 to 
evaluate depressive symptoms, 
which have some overlap with 
postconcussive symptoms. We 
cannot determine which particular 
components of our intervention 
were responsible for symptom 
reduction; nevertheless, a health 
services approach to providing 
comprehensive services was 
intentional and aligned with real-
world clinic conditions. Usual care at 
the regional children’s hospital where 
the study was conducted included 
multidisciplinary rehabilitative 
services at pediatric outpatient 
clinics. It is worth noting that 
adolescents randomly assigned to the 
usual care control group displayed 
symptom reduction over the course 
of 6 months. However, adolescents 
who received collaborative care 
continued to make symptom 
reduction gains between 3 and 6 
months, whereas the symptoms of 
adolescents in the control group 
plateaued after 3 months.
Previous studies have established 
the role of depression in mediating 
poor outcomes of children with 
traumatic brain injury.

investigation contributes to an 
expanding literature on combined 
medical–behavioral health care 
in the pediatric setting aimed at 
improving physical and behavioral 
health outcomes measured by both 
symptoms and associated health-
related quality of life. Our findings 
indicate that co-occurrence of 
depressive symptoms in slow-to-
recover adolescents is common 
and suggests that a continuum 
of care management, CBT, and 
pharmacotherapy when necessary is 
a promising approach for reducing 
the burden of postconcussive

symptoms and associated functional 
impairment. Additional cost 
analysis is warranted to assess cost 
savings and health care utilization 
associated with a collaborative care 
treatment program for slow-to-
recover patients compared with 
traditional outpatient care. In 
the absence of empirically based 
treatment options for this patient 
population, this study provides 
evidence for the application of 
the collaborative care model of 
integrated care for postconcussive 
symptoms. In settings where 
adaptation of the collaborative 
care model may not be feasible, 
components of the collaborative 
care intervention including 
skill training in behavioral 
activation, coping, relaxation, 
or sleep hygiene techniques in 
addition to closer coordination 
with schools might be incorporated 
into provider visits. Larger-
scale randomized clinical trials 
are needed in this understudied 
and critical aspect of adolescent 
medicine. Our findings prompt 
more investigation into the 
role of affective symptoms in 
perpetuating physical symptoms 
secondary to prolonged recovery 
from sports-related concussion.
