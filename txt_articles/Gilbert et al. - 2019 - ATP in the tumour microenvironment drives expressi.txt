Abstract
The ATP-gated receptor P2X7 is expressed in multiple malignant tumours including neuroblastoma, melanoma, prostate,
lung and breast. P2X7 has a significant role in mediating diverse cell responses, which upon dysregulation are associated
with tumour initiation and development. The rapid, ATP-mediated activation of P2X7 induces a fast-inward cation current in
cells. However, prolonged ATP-mediated activation of P2X7 leads to formation of a pore that increases membrane
permeability and eventually causes cell death. This presents a potential paradox, as the tumour microenvironment contains
extracellular ATP at levels sufficient to activate the P2X7 pore and trigger cell death. However, P2X7 expression is
associated with enhanced cancer cell survival, proliferation and metastatic potential. At least one distinct conformational
form of P2X7, termed non-pore functional P2X7 (nfP2X7), has been described, which is not able to form a functional pore.
We demonstrate for the first time in this study that exposure to a high ATP concentration, equivalent to those measured in the
tumour microenvironment, drives nfP2X7 expression and also that nfP2X7 is essential for tumour cell survival. We show that
monoclonal antibodies raised against a P2X7 amino acid sequence (200–216), whose conformation is distinct from that of
wild-type (WT) P2X7, bind specifically to nfP2X7 expressed on the surface of tumour cells. We also show that nfP2X7 is
broadly expressed in patient-derived tumour sections from a wide range of cancers. Therefore, antibodies raised against
E200 provide tools that can differentiate between forms of the P2X7 receptor that have a key role in cancer.
Introduction
P2X receptors (P2Xs) are ATP-gated cation channels that
form homo- and hetero-trimers at the cell membrane [1, 2].
The P2X family comprised of seven members. Although
P2X1–P2X6 are sensitive to ATP concentrations within the
nanomolar to low micromolar range, P2X7 is less sensitive
and requires hundreds of micromolar to millimolar ATP
concentrations for activation [2, 3]. P2X7 is characterised
by a biphasic response [4]. Rapid exposure to ATP trigger
opening of a cation-selective channel allowing Na+ and
Ca2+ influx, and K+ efflux, whereas prolonged ATP sti-
mulation triggers opening of a non-selective pore perme-
able to molecules of < 900 Da. Opening of the P2X7
pore disrupts intracellular homeostasis, leading to cell
death [5–7]. Paradoxically, P2X7 activation also drives
cytokine release, survival, metabolic adaptations to nutrient
deprivation, proliferation, migration and cancer cell inva-
sion [8–11]. Thus, P2X7, expressed by cancer cells, can
promote a pro-survival and oncogenic outcome rather than
facilitating cell death [12–14].

 ATP is present at high concentrations (5–10 mM) intra-
cellularly and at very low concentrations in the extracellular
compartment of healthy tissues (10–100 nM) [15]. However,
in the tumour microenvironment (TME), extracellular ATP
(eATP) concentrations can reach hundreds of micromolar [10,
16]. This is due to release of ATP through tumour cell death
caused by stresses such as inflammation, hypoxia, mechanical
stress and non-targeted therapies [17–19]. In addition, eATP
can be increased by cell death-independent mechanisms [15,
18, 19]. Release of ATP is one of the most sensitive danger-
associated molecular patterns [15]. The tandem activity of two
ectonucleotidases, CD39 and CD73, catalyse eATP hydrolysis
to adenosine, thus removing the danger signal. Although high
ATP drives inflammation, adenosine is a potent immuno-
suppressor [15]. Therefore, the balance between ATP and
adenosine orchestrates immunogenicity within the TME.
Tumour cells are exposed to ATP concentrations in the
TME sufficient to activate the non-selective pore and pre-
cipitate cell death. It was shown previously that in neuro-
blastoma, P2X7 is uncoupled from intracellular cell death-
promoting pathways [20]. Indeed, multiple cancer cell types
must have developed mechanisms to exploit the trophic
advantages mediated by P2X7, while minimising the detri-
mental effects associated with uncontrolled pore opening.
Previous reports have identified alternative forms of P2X7
termed non-functional P2X7 (nfP2X7), which do not show
large pore function in response to agonist stimulation [17,
21–24]. Polyclonal antibodies raised against the 200–216
amino acid sequence (termed E200) have demonstrated
E200 is selectively exposed in nfP2X7 but not in wild-type
(WT) P2X7 [21]. These antibodies have been used to
demonstrate strong nfP2X7 expression in several cancer
types [25–27]. E200 targeting polyclonal antibodies have
been developed as therapeutics and show early indications
of efficacy against basal cell carcinoma in a phase 1 clinical
trial [28] (clinicaltrials.gov NCT02587819).
Here we show that nfP2X7 is expressed on multiple
cancer cell lines and is necessary for their survival. By
mimicking the high ATP concentrations present in the TME,
we induce nfP2X7 and down-modulate P2X7 expression.
This provides a mechanism by which tumour cells can
maintain the survival advantages, while avoiding cell death
induction through opening of the P2X7 pore (Fig. 8).
Results
P2X7 mRNA is expressed in multiple cancer cell lines
that do not show pore function
To test the capacity of cancer cells to form the P2X7-asso-
ciated pore, we measured the effect of the ATP analogue,
2′,3′-(4-benzoyl)-benzoyl-ATP (BzATP) on ethidium bro-
mide (EtBr) influx in a panel of cancer cell lines [29]. RPMI-
8226 (myeloma) and SK-MEL-5 (melanoma) showed rapid
EtBr uptake in response to agonist stimulation (Fig. 1a, b),
which was inhibited by pre-incubation with P2X7-specific
inhibitors A438079 and A740003 (Fig. 1c, d). Other cell
lines, including PC3, DU145 and LNCaP (Prostate), Kelly
(neuroblastoma) and Ramos (Burkitt’s lymphoma), showed
no induction of EtBr influx in response to stimulation with
0.5 mM BzATP (Fig. 1a, b). The absence of EtBr influx was
not due to a lack of P2RX7 transcript in these cell lines, as
quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis demonstrated expression
of P2RX7 mRNA in all cell lines (Fig. 1e). Cell lines with
P2X7 pore functionality such as SK-MEL-5 and RPMI-8226
showed the highest P2RX7 mRNA expression levels. PC3
and LNCaP cells, which showed no pore function, also
expressed P2RX7 mRNA. DU145, Kelly and Ramos also
showed no pore function, expressing low yet detectable
levels of P2RX7 transcript. We further tested whether ion
channel functionality was retained in nfP2X7. PC3 cells
respond to ATP stimulation with a fast calcium influx,
typical of the activation of P2Y receptors, followed by a
more sustained calcium influx that was blocked by two
specific P2X7 inhibitors A740003 and AZ10606120 (Fig.
1f). This suggests that nfP2X7 can function as an ion
channel. These data show that cancer cell lines with no pore
function express P2RX7 transcript, and that nfP2X7 retains
ion channel function.
E200-targeted antibodies specifically bind nfP2X7
Two antibodies were raised against the E200 sequence: a
fully humanised single-chain domain antibody, designated
BIL03s [30], and a mouse hybridoma-derived monoclonal
antibody, designated BPM09. Both antibodies were shown
by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to bind
dose dependently to the E200 peptide (Fig. 2a, b). To
confirm the specificity of these antibodies for nfP2X7 we
used P2RX7-targeted small interfering RNA (siRNA).
Three different siRNA oligonucleotides strongly inhibited
P2RX7 transcript expression and BIL03s binding to PC3
cells (Fig. 2c, d). The same outcomes were observed for
BPM09 (data not shown). We then confirmed that BIL03s
binding to the E200 sequence on nfP2X7 was through its
complementarity-determining regions by competing its
binding with increasing amounts of E200 peptide, while an
irrelevant peptide control had no effect (Fig. 2e). We
investigated by flow cytometry the ability of BIL03s to
compete for binding of BPM09 to PC3 cells (Fig. 2f).
BIL03s reduced BPM09 binding in a dose-dependent
manner compared with isotype control. Overall, our data
demonstrates that both BIL03s and BPM09 bind selectively

 to E200 exposed on nfP2X7 at the surface of PC3 cancer
cells.
To confirm surface expression of nfP2X7, we assessed
binding of BIL03s to a panel of cell lines by flow cytometry
(Fig. 2g). Cell lines demonstrating low EtBr influx (Fig. 1a),
such as PC3, DU145, LNCaP and Kelly showed increased
BIL03s binding compared with fully functional cell lines,
RPMI-8226 and SK-MEL-5 (Fig. 2g). There was low

 correlation between P2RX7 mRNA expression and BIL03s
binding. However, we did not anticipate a close correlation
between BIL03s binding and transcript level, as most of the
transcript might be translated into P2X7 in some cell types
or nfP2X7 in other cell types.

 nfP2X7 is distinct from functional P2X7
To evaluate the relative amount of P2X7 and nfP2X7 at the
cell surface, we investigated binding of BIL03s and the anti-
P2X7 monoclonal L4 antibody, relative to isotype control in
a panel of cancer cell lines (Fig. 3a). L4 was generated by
immunisation of mice with a syngeneic cell line over-
expressing human P2X7 variant a (P2X7a) [31]. Ramos cells
showed no binding of nfP2X7-specific antibodies BIL03s
(Fig. 2c), BPM09 (data not shown) or anti-P2X7a L4 anti-
body in agreement with previous reports showing that these
cells do not express P2X7 [32]. BIL03s bound to all other
cancer cell lines tested between two- and eight-fold above
isotype control (Fig. 3a), suggesting that nfP2X7 is
expressed broadly in many cancer cell types as observed
previously [25–27]. Comparing L4 and BIL03s binding
with EtBr uptake (Figs. 1a, b and 3a) showed that high L4
and low BIL03s binding correlates with the capacity of cells
to open the non-selective pore (Fig. 3a). Conversely, cell
lines with no functional pore activity showed low L4 and
higher BIL03s binding (Fig. 3a). These observations sug-
gest that BIL03s and L4 bind to distinct forms of P2X7.
To confirm that BIL03s does not recognise WT P2X7, we
stably overexpressed P2X7a in PC3 cells and sorted the high
expressing cells based on L4 binding. P2X7a over-
expression and L4 binding to the selected population was
confirmed by western blotting, flow cytometry and immu-
nofluorescence (Fig. 3b, c and Supplementary Figure 1).
These cells showed P2X7-dependent pore activity in
response to 0.5 mM BzATP (Fig. 3d). Despite demon-
strating increased surface expression of P2X7a, a decrease
in BIL03s binding was observed (Fig. 3c), suggesting that
high surface P2X7a expression may attenuate expression of
nfP2X7 at the cell surface. These results show that BIL03s
binds specifically to nfP2X7 and not to P2X7a, whereas L4
binding reflects the expression level of P2X7a but not
nfP2X7.
To confirm that BIL03s does not bind to WT P2X7, we
investigated the effect of two distinct siRNAs on BIL03s
and L4 binding to PC3 or to PC3-P2X7a cells. Although
siRNA A targets the coding sequence of P2RX7 (Fig. 3e)
and therefore targets both endogenous P2RX7 and the
P2RX7 transgene, siRNA B targets the 3′-untranslated
region and only downregulates endogenous P2RX7, as the
P2RX7 transgene lacks the 3′-untranslated region. As
anticipated on the basis of the target sequence, siRNA A
downregulated both L4 and BIL03s binding in PC3 and
PC3-P2X7a
cells.
However,
siRNA
B
downregulated
BIL03s but not L4 binding, confirming that BIL03s
recognises the product of the endogenous P2RX7 gene and
not the transfected P2RX7 (Fig. 3f). Surprisingly, siRNA B
knockdown caused an increase in L4 binding, although this
was not statistically significant. E200 is adjacent to the
ATP-binding pocket and could become exposed upon a
change in receptor conformation caused by ATP binding.
However, BIL03s and BPM09 binding were not affected by
1 mM ATP, demonstrating that ATP binding to P2X7 does
not affect E200 exposure (Supplementary Figure 2). These
data demonstrate that BIL03s and L4 bind to molecularly
distinct forms of P2X7. Although L4 binds to the WT P2X7
associated with pore function, BIL03s binds to nfP2X7.
nfP2X7 expression is induced by mimicking the high
ATP concentration present in the TME
Studies have shown that nfP2X7 is highly expressed in
tumour biopsies [25–27]. We hypothesised that high ATP
concentrations present within the TME might drive this
high expression. To test this hypothesis, we used RPMI-
8226 cells to analyse the effect of overnight ATP incubation
on BIL03s and L4 binding, and pore function (Fig. 4a, b).
Overnight incubation with ATP in the 0.1–0.25 mM range
led to a progressive decrease in pore function that was
completely abrogated when the ATP concentration was
raised to 0.5 mM (Fig. 4a). Decreased pore formation cor-
related with both a decrease in L4 binding and an increase
of BIL03s binding (Fig. 4b). An increase in BIL03s binding
was observed at ATP concentrations of 0.5 mM and above
(Fig. 4b). These concentrations are similar to those mea-
sured in the TME [16]. Hence, RPMI-8226 cells adapt to
high ATP concentrations by switching from P2X7 to pore-
deficient nfP2X7. Representative population histograms
show the change in staining for BIL03s and L4 between
untreated cells and cells pre-stimulated with 1 mM ATP
(Fig. 4e).
To assess the speed of change between P2X7 forms, we
performed a time course in the presence of 1 mM ATP (Fig.
4c, d). One-hour stimulation with 1 mM ATP was sufficient

 to abrogate pore formation in response to BzATP agonist
(Fig. 4c) and correlated with decreased L4 binding at 1 h,
whereas BIL03s binding remained unchanged (Fig. 4d). L4
binding to RPMI-8226 cells decreased with time of ATP
exposure with most binding abolished by 3 h. In contrast,
BIL03s binding only increased 2 h after ATP incubation.
200
SM Gilbert et al.
 Our data show that incubation with ATP promotes a rapid
downregulation of WT P2X7, followed by a slower increase
in surface nfP2X7.
nfP2X7 expression is transient and peaks at 24 h post
ATP stimulation (Supplementary Figure. 3a). Induction of
nfP2X7 in RPMI-8226 cells requires the presence of func-
tional P2X7 at the cell surface as demonstrated by L4-
binding data (Supplementary Figure. 3b). ATP treatment
leads to a rapid decrease in WT P2X7 at the cell surface,
which removes the drive for a further increase in nfP2X7.
Other cellular stresses and danger-associated molecular
patterns may also drive nfP2X7 exposure at the surface of
cancer cells and are being investigated.
As opening of the P2X7 pore can be cytotoxic, it is
possible that the ATP-mediated shift in L4 and BIL03s
binding is the result of the selection of P2X7
low/nfP2X7
high
cell population. Overnight incubation of RPMI-8226 cells
with 1 mM ATP led to 40%–50% loss of viability (Fig. 4f).
However, the slower increase in nfP2X7 expression, mea-
sured by BIL03s binding, suggests that this could be protein
synthesis dependent. To address this, we tested whether
blocking protein synthesis would prevent increases in
BIL03s binding. Figure 4g shows that cycloheximide
treatment abrogated the ATP-induced increase in BIL03s
binding at 4 h without affecting cell viability (data not
shown), thus demonstrating that nfP2X7 induction is an
active mechanism requiring protein synthesis and not
mediated solely by selection of a P2X7
low/nfP2X7
high sub-
population.
RPMI-8226 cells were incubated in the presence of
1 mM
ATP
alone
or
with
P2X7-selective
inhibitors
(A438079 or A740003) for 16 h, and BIL03s and L4
binding were measured. The ATP-induced increase in
BIL03s binding and decrease in L4 binding were partially
blocked by both P2X7 inhibitors, suggesting that the P2X7
to nfP2X7 switch required P2X7 signalling (Fig. 4h). Similar
results were observed in the adherent melanoma cancer cell
line SK-MEL-5 that also showed an ATP-induced increase
in nfP2X7 expression, driven by a higher ATP concentration
(5 mM) (Supplementary Figure 4).
nfP2X7 is present intracellularly and localises to the
membrane upon ATP stimulation
To test whether nfP2X7 was present intracellularly, we
investigated the cellular localisation of nfP2X7 by immu-
nofluorescence. When comparing BPM09 detection with
the known intracellular protein calreticulin, we found
nfP2X7 to be present intracellularly and released to the
membrane upon ATP stimulation (Fig. 5a, b). This suggests
that nfP2X7 might correspond to a misfolded form of P2X7
normally retained intracellularly. A similar mechanism was
described
for
mutated
cystic
fibrosis
transmembrane
receptor (CFTR) [33]. We tested this hypothesis using
KM11060, a small molecule corrector, to increase the
secretion rate of misfolded proteins to the membrane [33].
Treatment with KM11060 for a 16 h period led to nfP2X7
exposure at the cell surface (Fig. 5e). This suggests that
nfP2X7 is sequestered intracellularly and could correspond
to a misfolded form of P2X7.
nfP2X7 is necessary for cancer cell survival
To assess the role of nfP2X7 in cancer cell survival, we
transfected three cell lines, devoid of P2X7 pore function
and possessing nfP2X7 (PC3, DU145 and LNCaP), with
three P2RX7-targeting siRNAs and measured the effect on
cell viability. Treatment with each of the three P2RX7-tar-
geted siRNAs caused significant cell death relative to con-
trol in all cell lines (Fig. 6a). We then showed that all
P2RX7-targeted siRNAs tested caused a significant increase
in Caspase 3/7 activation in each cell lines indicating that
nfP2X7 depletion leads to apoptosis (Fig. 6b). These data
demonstrate that in the absence of WT P2X7, nfP2X7 is
essential for cancer cell survival.
We then investigated whether similar results could be
obtained in cancer cell lines expressing high levels of WT
P2X7. Although P2RX7 siRNA significantly reduced L4

concentration present in the tumour microenvironment. a, b RPMI-

stimulation was measured (mean from three independent experiments

 binding in SK-MEL-5, it did not have an effect on cell
viability, suggesting that nfP2X7 but not WT P2X7 is
required for cancer cell survival (Fig. 6c, d). We then
transfected P2RX7-targeting siRNA A and B into both PC3
WT and PC3 overexpressing P2X7a (Fig. 6e). Loss of cell
viability was not rescued when PC3 cells overexpressing
P2X7a were transfected with siRNA B. Similar results were
seen in the presence of increasing ATP concentrations
(Supplementary Figure 5). These data demonstrate that
nfP2X7 is necessary for cancer cell survival, and that loss of
cell viability cannot be rescued by P2X7a. Therefore,
although nfP2X7 has lost pore function, it retains a distinct
pro-survival trophic activity.
nfP2X7 is expressed in a broad range of tumours
To examine the potential of nfP2X7 as a therapeutic target,
we assessed nfP2X7 membrane expression in tissue samples
from a panel including 70 normal and 52 tumour samples.
Weak membrane staining was observed in six normal

samples showed continuous positive staining (Fig. 7a, b).
To assess nfP2X7 expression to normal cells, we performed

L4 antibody is not suitable for immunohistochemical stu-
dies, we used a commercially sourced polyclonal antibody
raised against part of the extracellular domain of P2X7a.
P2X7 is detected in fewer samples than nfP2X7 (44%
average positive tumours for nfP2X7 against 18% for P2X7)
with higher nfP2X7 expression observed in bladder, kidney,
colorectal and lung cancer including all of the 18 squamous
non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) samples tested (Fig.
7c). With the exception of ovarian, all other tumour types
show higher nfP2X7 expression. Varying overlap between
P2X7 and nfP2X7 expression is seen between tumour types,
whereas only nfP2X7 is detected in liver, large cell lung
cancer, sarcoma and cancer of the pleura. Representative
BPM09 staining shows examples of positive staining with
clear membrane localisation at the surface of colorectal,
bladder, NSCLC and renal cancer tissue sections (Fig. 7d).
These data show that nfP2X7 is more broadly detected than
P2X7 in tumour samples with varying overlap between
P2X7 and nfP2X7 expression across tumour types.

 Discussion
In this study, we demonstrate for the first time that nfP2X7,
characterised by exposure of E200 and loss of pore function,
is distinct from functional P2X7 and is necessary for the
survival of multiple cancer cell lines potentially through its
retained ion channel function. We show that exposure to high
ATP concentrations, similar to those present in the TME,
facilitates a switch from P2X7 to nfP2X7 that enables cells to
exploit the survival advantages of nfP2X7 signalling without
the consequence of pore-mediated cell death (Fig. 8). Fur-
thermore, our data confirms nfP2X7 is widely expressed at the
surface of cancer cells and in a broad range of tumours.
P2X7 has been shown to support tumour growth and
invasiveness in vivo in several cancer types [9, 34–36].
Previous reports have also shown that lack of or depletion
of P2X7 causes or accelerates apoptosis in HEK293 and
breast cancer cells [37, 38]. These studies neither investi-
gate the functional status of P2X7 pore, nor the exposure of
E200 on P2X7. Our data show that although nfP2X7 is
unable to form a pore, it retains ion channel capability and
supports cancer cell survival. Besides its trophic role, P2X7
promotes cytokine release [8, 39], activation of transcription
factors [40] and adaption to serum-deprived conditions [12,
14]. It is possible that these functions contribute to nfP2X7-
mediated cancer cell survival.
Converging evidence has shown that WT P2X7 can support
cell proliferation [9, 14, 41]. This suggests that if cells are able
to regulate opening of the P2X7 pore, they may exploit the
trophic potential of P2X7, without the untoward effects of pore
opening. Our data shows that WT P2X7 overexpressed in PC3
cells could not rescue cell death caused by knockdown of
endogenous
nfP2X7
even
in
the
presence
of
agonist
stimulation. This suggests that nfP2X7 provides a con-
stitutively active survival signal, which cannot be replaced by
WT P2X7. Although our results show that P2X7 and nfP2X7
are distinct, it is possible that nfP2X7 is present in hetero-
trimeric forms with WT P2X7, inhibiting its signalling as
previously reported for P2X7 splice variant j [42]. Our data
suggests that nfP2X7 is sequestered intracellularly and may
correspond to a misfolded form of P2X7 as already reported
for mutant forms of CFTR receptor (Fig. 5c). The observation
that ATP-mediated E200 exposure requires protein synthesis
(Fig. 4g) suggests that ATP signalling through P2X7 promotes
machinery necessary for nfP2X7 localisation to the membrane.
Furthermore, it is still debated whether opening of the large
pore involves pannexin-1 or connexins. Our data show that
WT P2X7 protein levels correlate with pore functionality but
do not exclude a role for these proteins.
Several mechanisms are responsible for the elevated ATP
concentration observed in the TME including dying tumour
cells releasing ATP [16, 18]. This mechanism is supported
by evidence from Ghiringhelli et al. [43] showing that
breast cancer patients treated with adjuvant chemotherapy
develop more aggressive metastatic disease if carrying the
P2RX7 mutation E496A, which abrogates pore function.
Ghiringhelli et al. [43] showed that ATP released in the
TME drives CD8+ T-cells priming by dendritic cells in a
P2X7-dependent
manner.
Our
data
showing
nfP2X7
expression in a subset of leucocytes suggest that nfP2X7
could also have a role in the regulation of immune cells in
the TME. Although several mutations in the P2RX7 gene
have been reported to impair pore function [44], our data
show that switching to E200 exposed nfP2X7 can provide a
fast-adaptive mechanism to protect cancer cells from high
ATP exposure.

 A number of studies have demonstrated that nfP2X7 is
expressed at the surface of several cancer types but is absent
at the surface of normal tissue [23, 26, 27, 41, 45]. Using a
panel of tissue specimens, we found nfP2X7 to be more
widely detected than P2X7 at the membrane of tumour cells
with
positive
immunohistological
staining
observed
in
approximately 40% of all samples tested. This study provides
significant evidence that nfP2X7 is a distinct form of P2X7
with the potential to play a critical role in cell signalling
leading to cancer cell survival. Further in vivo studies will be
undertaken to establish further the role of nfP2X7 in cancer.
Material and methods
Reagent and antibodies
EtBr solution was purchased from Biorad. ATP, Fura-2 AM
and phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)-based enzyme-free
dissociation buffer were from Thermo Fisher Scientific.
BzATP and A438079 were from Sigma. A740003 was from
Tocris Bioscience. Monoclonal antibody clone L4 [31] was
kindly provided by Professor James Wiley and Dr. Ben Gu.
Cell culture
All cell lines were purchased from ATCC, except for
LNCaP and Kelly, which were obtained from ECACC. All
cell lines were authenticated by short tandem repeat analysis
in October 2017. PC3 cells were cultured in F12K nutrient
mixture Kaighn’s modification, 10% fetal calf serum (FCS).
DU145 and SK-MEL-5 cells were cultured in minimum
essential medium eagle, 10% FCS. LNCaP, Kelly and
RPMI-8226 cells were cultured in RPMI medium 1640,
10% FCS.
Immunofluorescence
Cells were cultured on coverslips or on poly-lysine-coated
coverslips for non-adherent cells, fixed with 4% paraf-
ormaldehyde in PBS, quenched with 0.1 M Glycine and
permeabilised in 0.2% Saponin, 5% FCS in PBS. Cells were
incubated with primary antibodies for 2 h at room tem-
perature (RT) followed by secondary fluorescently labelled
antibodies (Jackson Immunoresearch) for 1 h at RT. Con-
focal images were then acquired.
Immunohistochemistry
Immunohistochemistry was performed on commercial Tis-
sue Microarrays (TMAs) obtained from USBiomax, who
obtained samples with full patient consent. BPM09 immu-
nohistochemistry was performed as previously described
[12, 27]. For anti-P2X7 (Novus: NBP2-19654), epitope
retrieval was carried out in 10 mM Tri-Sodium Citrate/
0.05% Tween 20, pH 6.0 for 20 min in a 600 W microwave
before permeabilisation in 0.2% Triton X-100 for 15 min at
RT and inactivation of endogenous peroxidase with a 3%
hydrogen peroxide for 20 min at RT, blocking in 10%
bovine serum albumin (BSA) at RT and staining overnight
at 4 °C with 10 μg/ml of primary antibody. Each step was
separated by tissue rinsing for 5 min in PBS. EnVision
(Dako) was used as chromogen and haematoxylin coun-
terstain. Slides were examined using a × 20 objective and
scored by a pathologist for membranous staining.
RNA interference transfection
A total of 200,000 cells were seeded in 6-well plates 16 h
before transfection with 70 nM of relevant P2RX7-targeted
siRNA from Origene using Lipofectamine RNAiMax. The
siRNA target sequences were: siRNA A: 5′-CCCGCA-
GAGCAAAGGAATTCAGACC-3′, B: 5′-GAGATATTGT
GAGGACAAATTGAGA-3′, C: 5′-ACAATGTTGAGAA
ACGGACTCTGAT-3′. AllStars scramble from Qiagen was
used as a control. siRNA effect on cell survival was ana-
lysed using 2000 cells seeded in 96-well plates and trans-
fected with 70 nM siRNA. 72 h after transfection, cell
numbers were assessed using the CellTitre-Blue assay
(Promega) or Apo One Caspase 3/7 assay (Promega).
Real-time qPCR
Total RNA was extracted and cDNA prepared from 1 μg of
RNA. qPCR was performed using primers for P2RX7
(forward: 5′-TCTGCAAGATGTCAAGGGC-3′, reverse:
5′-TCACTCTTCGGAAACTCTTTCC-3′)
and
three
housekeeping genes: β-actin (forward: 5′-CATCCTCACC
CTGAAGTACC-3′, reverse: 5′-TTAATGTCACGCACGA
TTTC-3′),
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
dehydrogenase
(forward: 5′-CTGCCGTCTAGAAAAACCTG-3′, reverse:
5′-GTCCAGGGGTCTTACTCCTT-3′)
and
β-2-micro-
globin (forward: 5′-ACTCACGTCATCCAGCAGAG-3′,
reverse: 5′-TTCCCCCAAATTCTAAGCAG-3′). Triplicate
qPCR reactions of 40 cycles were performed followed by
melting curves. P2RX7 transcript expression was normal-
ised as previously reported [46]. Biological triplicates were
tested for each sample.
Ethidium influx assay
Fifty-thousand cells were seeded in 96-well plates 16 h
before assay. Non-adherent cells RPMI-8226 and Ramos
were seeded in poly-lysine-coated plates. Cells were washed
twice with salt buffer (HEPES 10 mM, KCl 5.6 mM, Glu-
cose 10 mM, NaCl 140 mM at pH 7.4) and incubated at
206
SM Gilbert et al.
 37 °C with 5% or 10% CO2 for 30 min. Cells were then
treated with EtBr 25 μM and ATP or BzATP in salt buffer at
37 °C. Inhibitors were applied 5 min before the addition of
agonist. Fluorescence (ex530–em620) was imaged every
minute for 2 h at 37 °C on a plate reader. Cells permeabilised
with 0.8% Triton were used for normalisation.
Calcium assay
Changes in the cytoplasmic free calcium ([Ca2+]i) con-
centration were measured with fura-2/AM as described
previously [47].
ELISA assay
Streptavidin-coated 96-well plates were coated with 5 μg/ml
of biotinylated E200 peptide for 16 h at 4 °C before 2 h
blocking with PBS, 1% BSA and 1% Tween 20. Serial
dilution of antibodies were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C before
1 h incubation with secondary antibody coupled to horse-
radish peroxidase and developing with tetramethylbenzidine
reagent. Plates were washed three times in PBS 1% Tween
20 between each step.
Flow cytometry
Fifty-thousand
cells
were
dissociated
in
PBS-based
enzyme-free dissociation buffer, washed and re-suspended
in staining buffer (PBS, 2% FCS). Cells were then stained
for 1 h with primary antibody, washed three times in
staining buffer before a 1 h incubation with fluorescently
coupled secondary antibody and 7-Amino Actinomycin D
(7AAD). Fluorescence staining on live cells was acquired
using a BD Accuri flow cytometer and analysed with
FlowJo-flow cytometry analysis software. Median fluores-
cence intensity of the live cell population was analysed
using 7AAD live dead staining.
Western blotting
Cellular proteins were extracted using RIPA buffer sup-
plemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors cocktail
from Roche Diagnostics. Equal protein amounts were ana-
lysed by SDS–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis/western
blotting using anti-P2X7 antibody from Alomone Labs
(APR-004) and anti-actin antibody from Abcam (ab3280)
as a loading control.
