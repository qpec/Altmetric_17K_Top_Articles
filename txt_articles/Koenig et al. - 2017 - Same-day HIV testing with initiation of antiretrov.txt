Abstract
Background
Attrition during the period from HIV testing to antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation is high
worldwide. We assessed whether same-day HIV testing and ART initiation improves reten-
tion and virologic suppression.
Methods and findings
We conducted an unblinded, randomized trial of standard ART initiation versus same-day
HIV testing and ART initiation among eligible adults �18 years old with World Health Organi-
zation Stage 1 or 2 disease and CD4 count �500 cells/mm3. The study was conducted
among outpatients at the Haitian Group for the Study of Kaposi’s Sarcoma and Opportunistic
infections (GHESKIO) Clinic in Port-au-Prince, Haiti. Participants were randomly assigned
(1:1) to standard ART initiation or same-day HIV testing and ART initiation. The standard
group initiated ART 3 weeks after HIV testing, and the same-day group initiated ART on the
day of testing. The primary study endpoint was retention in care 12 months after HIV testing
with HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/ml. We assessed the impact of treatment arm with a modified
intention-to-treat analysis, using multivariable logistic regression controlling for potential con-
founders. Between August 2013 and October 2015, 762 participants were enrolled; 59 partic-
ipants transferred to other clinics during the study period, and were excluded as per protocol,
leaving 356 in the standard and 347 in the same-day ART groups. In the standard ART

 group, 156 (44%) participants were retained in care with 12-month HIV-1 RNA <50 copies,
and 184 (52%) had <1,000 copies/ml; 20 participants (6%) died. In the same-day ART group,
184 (53%) participants were retained with HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/ml, and 212 (61%) had
<1,000 copies/ml; 10 (3%) participants died. The unadjusted risk ratio (RR) of being retained
at 12 months with HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/ml was 1.21 (95% CI: 1.04, 1.38; p = 0.015) for the
same-day ART group compared to the standard ART group, and the unadjusted RR for
being retained with HIV-1 RNA <1,000 copies was 1.18 (95% CI: 1.04, 1.31; p = 0.012). The
main limitation of this study is that it was conducted at a single urban clinic, and the generaliz-
ability to other settings is uncertain.
Conclusions
Same-day HIV testing and ART initiation is feasible and beneficial in this setting, as it
improves retention in care with virologic suppression among patients with early clinical HIV
disease.

Author summary
Why was this study done?
• Multiple visits for counseling, laboratory testing, and other procedures to prepare
patients for initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) are burdensome and contribute to
the high rate of attrition during the period from HIV testing to ART initiation.
• The World Health Organization (WHO) recently changed their guidelines to recom-
mend ART for all persons living with HIV, facilitating ART initiation.
• This study was conducted to determine if ART initiation on the day of HIV diagnosis
could improve treatment initiation rates, retention in care, and HIV viral suppression
for patients with asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic HIV disease.
What did the researchers do and find?
• We randomly assigned patients who presented for HIV testing at a clinic in Port-au-
Prince, Haiti to standard ART initiation or same-day HIV testing and ART initiation
(356 in the standard and 347 in the same-day groups).
• The standard group had 3 weekly visits with a social worker and physician and then
started ART 21 days after the date of HIV diagnosis; the same-day ART group initiated
ART on the day of HIV diagnosis.
• All participants in the same-day ART group and 92% of participants in the standard
group initiated ART.

 • At 12 months after HIV testing, a higher proportion of participants in the same-day
ART group were retained in care (80% versus 72%), and a higher proportion were
retained in care with viral load <50 copies/ml (53% versus 44%) and viral load <1,000
copies/ml (61% versus 52%).
What do these findings mean?
• This study demonstrates that it is feasible to initiate ART on the day of HIV diagnosis
for patients with early HIV clinical disease and that same-day treatment leads to
increased ART uptake, retention in care, and viral suppression.
• Though same-day ART initiation improves outcomes, retention in care and viral sup-
pression remain suboptimal, so further interventions to maximize long-term outcomes
will be essential.
• The study is limited by being conducted at 1 clinic in urban Haiti. Further study will be
necessary to determine if this strategy will be effective in other settings.
Introduction
The Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) 90-90-90 targets state that
90% of HIV-infected persons know their status, 90% initiate antiretroviral therapy (ART), and
90% achieve virologic suppression by the year 2020 to curb the AIDS epidemic [1]. In 2015,
the World Health Organization (WHO) updated their guidelines to recommend ART for all
persons living with HIV based on evidence that earlier treatment improves outcomes and
decreases transmission [2–4]. To achieve these goals, patients must be promptly linked to HIV
services, initiated on ART, and retained in lifelong care [5].
Attrition rates are particularly high during the period from HIV testing to ART initiation,
with one-quarter to one-third of patients lost in the process of starting ART [6–9]. Even if
many of these patients re-engage in care at a later date, they will return with more advanced
disease. Though there are many factors that contribute to pretreatment attrition, the current
standard of care in most settings, which requires multiple sequential visits for HIV testing and
counseling, laboratory testing, and adherence counseling prior to ART initiation, creates barri-
ers to treatment initiation. As of June 2016, WHO guidelines note inadequate evidence to sup-
port a recommendation of same-day HIV testing and ART initiation [2]. However, the
availability of point-of-care tests, the fact that CD4 cell counts are no longer necessary prior to
ART initiation, and the provision of same-day counseling can accelerate treatment initiation,
potentially reducing attrition [10–12]. We conducted a randomized trial in Haiti to determine
whether same-day HIV testing and ART initiation, as compared with standard ART initiation,
improves retention in care with viral suppression.

 the Study of Kaposi’s Sarcoma and Opportunistic infections (GHESKIO) in Port-au-Prince,
Haiti. Haiti is the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere, with adult HIV prevalence of
1.7% [13,14]. GHESKIO is a Haitian nongovernmental organization and the largest provider
of HIV care in the Caribbean, treating up to 700 patients per day for HIV and/or tuberculosis
(TB). All care is provided free of charge. The study was approved by the institutional review
boards at Partners Healthcare, GHESKIO, Weill Cornell Medical College, and Florida Interna-
tional University. See supporting information files S1 Text for the study protocol and S2 Text
for the CONSORT checklist.
Participants
Participants were recruited from the HIV voluntary counseling and testing center at GHES-
KIO from August 2013 to October 2015. They received HIV testing and posttest counseling;
those with a positive HIV test were referred for same-day physician evaluation, CD4 count
(FACS Count, Becton-Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, New Jersey), WHO staging, and chest radio-
graph. Patients were eligible for study inclusion if they were infected with HIV-1, �18 years of
age, and had WHO Stage 1 or 2 disease and CD4 count �500 cells/mm3. Initially, enrollment
was limited to patients with CD4 count �350 cells/mm3, but in February 2014, the cutoff
was increased to �500 cells/mm3 in response to revised WHO and Haitian guidelines [15].
Patients were excluded if they were already aware of their HIV diagnosis, had received ART
previously, were pregnant or breastfeeding, lived outside of the greater Port-au-Prince metro-
politan area, planned to transfer care during the study period, or failed to demonstrate pre-
paredness on an ART readiness survey, which was administered by a social worker prior to
study enrollment. The survey includes a 5-point scale, with respondents ranking their pre-
paredness from “not at all ready” to “completely ready” in response to 7 questions. Study inclu-
sion required a response of “somewhat ready” or “completely ready” for all 7 questions (S3
Text) [16].
Randomization and masking
After the patients had provided written informed consent, the study team performed a
screening evaluation for study exclusion criteria, and eligible participants were enrolled
and randomized on the day of HIV testing. Participants were randomly assigned with the
use of a computer-generated random-number list to either standard ART or same-day
ART initiation in a 1:1 ratio, with allocation concealment. The randomization sequence
was generated by a computer in the GHESKIO data management unit by a data manager
who had no other involvement in study procedures. Participants were enrolled in the study
and assigned to groups by a study physician. Participants, site personnel, and study statisti-
cians were not masked to group assignment.
Procedures
After randomization, the standard group participants received ART initiation procedures that
mirror national guidelines. Participants were referred to return on Day 7 for baseline labora-
tory tests (creatinine, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, complete blood
count, purified protein derivative [PPD]), physician evaluation, and counseling with a social
worker. On Day 10, they received interpretation of PPD results, and on Days 14 and 21, they
were seen by a physician and social worker for additional counseling, test results, and ongoing
evaluations for opportunistic infections. Participants started ART on Day 21 and had an addi-
tional social worker and physician visit at Week 5 (Fig 1). The ART regimen was the same as

 that for nonstudy patients at GHESKIO. First-line therapy included a single combination tab-
let including tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, lamivudine, and efavirenz.
The same-day ART group had identical laboratory tests as the standard ART group, a
30-minute counseling session with a social worker, and physician evaluation, and then initiated
the same ART regimen as the standard ART group. They returned on Day 3 for physician and
social worker visits and receipt of baseline laboratory test results; those with creatinine clearance
<50 mL/minute as calculated by the Cockcroft-Gault equation were switched from tenofovir to
zidovudine or abacavir. They returned on Days 10 and 17 for additional physician and social
worker visits and on Day 24 for a physician visit. The same number of scheduled physician visits

 and counseling sessions were provided to each group so that the only difference in care was in
the schedule of visits during the first 5 weeks of the study and the timing of ART initiation.
All care was delivered by GHESKIO clinic staff, and the same providers (physicians, nurses,
social workers, pharmacists, and field workers) cared for both groups. A counseling manual
was followed with an outline for the social workers to follow at each scheduled counseling
visit; these were identical between groups, except for the timing of ART initiation, and each
session took about 30 minutes. All counseling was provided for individual patients, rather
than for groups. The counseling sessions were audiotaped and systematically evaluated for
quality control purposes. If a participant in either group missed a study visit that included a
scheduled social worker counseling session, the counseling was provided at the next visit.
Participants in both groups had monthly physician visits throughout the follow-up period
and received the same package of services provided to all HIV-infected patients at GHESKIO,
including prophylactic treatment with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and isoniazid. Field
workers phoned patients who missed a visit and attempted a home visit for those not reachable
by phone. Participants received a transportation subsidy of 100 Haitian gourdes (US$1.70) per
visit.
Outcomes
The primary endpoint was retention in care with HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/ml at 12 months
after HIV testing. Retention was defined as attending the 12-month visit (1 clinic visit between
12 and 15 months after HIV testing). Lost to follow-up (LTFU) was defined as failure to attend
the 12-month visit. Deaths were ascertained by review of medical records or report from fam-
ily members. A National Institutes of Health Division of AIDS Expedited Adverse Event Form
was filled out within 48 hours after the study team became aware of any death. Transfers were
ascertained by confirmation that the participant was receiving care at a different site. Second-
ary outcomes include survival, ART initiation, retention in care with HIV-1 RNA <1,000 cop-
ies/ml at 12 months after HIV testing, adherence as measured by pharmacy refill records and
self-report, and cost and cost-effectiveness of standard and same-day ART; the adherence and
cost-effectiveness evaluations will be reported in separate manuscripts.
Statistical analysis
Demographic, clinical, and laboratory data from the electronic medical record and study
forms were de-identified, entered into an Excel spreadsheet, and exported into Stata v14 soft-
ware (StataCorp, 2011, College Station, Texas) for analysis. After study completion, all partici-
pants who were LTFU were recontacted to determine their vital status.
The study was powered to detect a 10% absolute difference in the rate of retention with
virologic suppression between the 2 groups at 12 months after enrollment (65% in the stan-
dard and 75% in the same-day ART group). At the α = 0.05 significance level, we estimated
that we would need to enroll 349 participants per group (698 in total) to achieve 80% power to
detect this difference. Because patients who transferred during the study period were excluded,
we increased the total sample size to 762 participants. For all analyses, a modified intention-to-
treat approach was used, in which all patients were analyzed according to their assignment
group, excluding patients who transferred to another facility during the follow-up period,
according to protocol.
Baseline characteristics were summarized using simple frequencies and proportions and
medians with interquartile ranges (IQRs) stratified by treatment arm. Among participants
who died, baseline CD4 count was compared using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. We compared
the proportion of participants who were retained in care with HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/ml

 (primary endpoint), retained with HIV-1 RNA <1,000 copies/ml, retained regardless of HIV-
1 RNA, initiated ART, and died (secondary endpoints) at 12 months after enrollment using a
chi-square test. We conducted multivariable logistic regression including all covariates listed
in Table 1 to control for any residual confounding. We present unadjusted and adjusted risk
ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals. Because of the change in enrollment criteria mid-
study, we conducted a sensitivity analysis that included only the participants who met the orig-
inal enrollment criteria of CD4 count �350 cells/mm3. In response to a reviewer’s request, we
also plotted retention in care, regardless of viral load, for both groups and compared the distri-
butions with the log-rank test. The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov number
NCT01900080.
Results
A total of 821 patients were screened, and 762 were enrolled in the study and underwent ran-
domization (Fig 2). After randomization, 59 participants (28 in the standard ART and 31 in
same-day ART group) transferred to another clinic and were excluded from all analyses, as per
protocol. The median age was 37 years old (IQR: 30–45 years), 347 (49%) were women, and
the median CD4 count was 248 cells/mm3 (IQR: 148, 345).
Of the 356 participants in the standard group, 256 (72%) were retained in care, 20 (6%)
died, and 80 (23%) were LTFU (Table 2). Among the 256 participants retained in the standard
ART group, 156 (61% of retained and 44% overall) had HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/ml. Of the 347
participants in the same-day ART group, 277 (80%) were retained in care, 10 (3%) died, and
60 (17%) were LTFU. Among the 277 participants retained in the same-day ART group, 184

 analysis that included only participants with CD4 count �350 cells/mm3, the adjusted RR for
mortality was 0.41 (95% CI: 0.18, 0.93; p = 0.033). Among the participants who died, the
median baseline CD4 count was 100 cells/mm3 (IQR: 45, 192) in the standard and 207 cells/
mm3 (IQR: 112, 291) in the same-day ART group (p = 0.078). Eight of 20 (40%) deaths in the
standard ART group occurred in participants who were LTFU prior to ART, 8 (40%) deaths
occurred in those LTFU after starting ART, and 4 (20%) occurred while in care; the causes of
death for those in care were stroke, trauma, and cancer in 3, and the fourth had pain and died
after seeing a traditional healer. Three of the 10 (30%) deaths in the same-day ART group
occurred in participants who were LTFU after starting ART; among the 7 (70%) participants
who died while in care, 1 of each died of stroke, pneumonia, malaria, renal failure, and sudden
death, and 2 died of gastroenteritis. No deaths for those in care were attributed to immune
reconstitution syndrome or an opportunistic infection that was missed at ART initiation. In
Fig 3, the Kaplan-Meier curve plots the retention in care, regardless of viral load, for both
groups. The log-rank test comparing the curves between the standard and same-day ART
group indicates a significant difference (p = 0.028).
In the same-day ART group, 344 of 347 (99%) participants started ART on the day of HIV
testing, and the remaining 3 patients started ART within the subsequent week. During the Day
3 follow-up visit, 13 patients (4%) in the same-day ART group had adjustments in their ART
regimens (replacement of tenofovir with zidovudine or abacavir) because they had creatinine
clearance <50 mL/minute on baseline testing. In the standard group, 281 (79%) participants
initiated ART by Day 28, the end of the time window for the 3-week ART initiation visit.
Thirty-six (10%) standard group participants initiated ART from Day 29 to Day 90, and 12
(3%) initiated ART after Day 90 due to late or missed visits. Twenty-seven (8%) standard
group participants never started ART during the study period because they were LTFU or died
prior to initiating treatment. Isoniazid prophylaxis was initiated for 337 (95%) participants in
the standard group and 340 (98%) in the same-day group. Eight cases of TB were diagnosed
during the first 3 months after ART initiation; 6 of these occurred in the standard group and 2
in the same-day ART group.

 Discussion
The results of this randomized controlled trial show that among HIV-infected adults with
early WHO Stage disease and CD4 count �500 cells/mm3, same-day HIV testing and ART ini-
tiation, as compared to standard care, improves retention in care with virologic suppression
and, in the multivariable analysis, decreases mortality. These results are important given recent
WHO 2016 guidelines stating the lack of evidence in support of same-day ART initiation.
Our findings suggest that ART initiation as soon as possible after HIV testing may be bene-
ficial for clinically stable patients. In resource-poor settings with fragile delivery systems, such
as Haiti, the provision of immediate support by care providers at the time of HIV diagnosis
can have both structural and individual impact. In addition to making treatment initiation
logistically easier for patients, we believe that same-day counseling and ART initiation increase
the sense of hope, optimism, and overall connectedness to the healthcare system for patients,
which have been shown to be important for retention [17–20].
Our findings are consistent with the results of the RapIT study, a randomized trial that
included participants in South Africa with WHO Stage 3 or 4 disease or CD4 count �350
cells/mm3 [11]. Participants in the standard group in that study generally started ART at the
sixth visit, and 72% of participants in the rapid group started ART on the day of study enroll-
ment. Rapid ART initiation resulted in a 17% improvement in retention and 13% improvement
in viral suppression. A stepped-wedge cluster-randomized trial in Uganda found an increase in
ART initiation within 2 weeks after eligibility by implementing a multicomponent intervention
to streamline ART initiation that included training healthcare workers, providing point-of-care
CD4 count testing platforms, eliminating mandatory multiple preinitiation sessions, and giving
feedback to facilities on their ART initiation rates [21]. A weighted proportion of 80% in the
intervention group had started ART within 2 weeks after eligibility compared with 38% in the
control group. A cohort study of same-day ART initiation in pregnant women in South Africa
also found high rates of treatment initiation, with 91% initiating ART on the day of referral to
the service [22]. In the intervention group of the Sustainable East Africa Research on Commu-
nity Health (SEARCH) HIV test-and-treat study, a cluster-randomized controlled trial con-
ducted in Kenya and Uganda, HIV-infected patients who were identified through community
testing were referred to HIV care upon diagnosis and then offered immediate ART initiation;
retention was high (89%) among patients newly linking to care [23].
At ART initiation, it is critical that patients are ready to start lifelong therapy, that TB
screening is conducted, and that renal function is evaluated to avoid the use of tenofovir in
patients with renal insufficiency. In this study, ART readiness was remarkably high, with over
99% of patients screened for the study reporting they were ready to start lifelong ART. This is
a particularly significant and timely finding for the provision of recommended universal ART
because the majority of people living with HIV have early clinical disease, and there has been
prior concern that healthier patients may be less willing to accept lifelong therapy [4]. Most
patients with early clinical disease do not have TB symptoms (cough, fever, night sweats, or
weight loss), so they do not require further work up to exclude TB, according to WHO guide-
lines [2]. With the exclusion of patients with a baseline chest x-ray that was suspicious for TB,
we found that less than 1% of participants in the same-day ART group had TB that was missed
at the time of ART initiation. We found that 4% of participants in the same-day ART group
had creatinine clearance <50 mL/minute; ART regimens were adjusted on Day 3 for these
patients.
Both groups in our study received high-level care, with multiple counseling and physician
visits in the first month, followed by monthly physician visits. At the time the study was
started, this was the standard of care in Haiti. However, this standard has shifted over the past

 few years towards decreased frequency of visits and nonphysician providers [2,24–27]. We
believe that same-day ART can be provided with fewer follow-up visits if proper counseling is
provided during the early period after ART initiation. However, clinic-level procedures play a
major role in the effectiveness of accelerated ART initiation strategies, as illustrated in Malawi,
where among nearly 22,000 pregnant women who started ART for mother-to-child preven-
tion, LTFU rates ranged from 0% to 58% between facilities and were highest among women
who initiated ART on the day of HIV testing at large clinics [28].
Though lower than anticipated, retention in both groups in our study was higher than
reports of standard ART initiation from other resource-poor settings. Two studies from South
Africa found that approximately one-third of patients remained in care from HIV testing
through 12 months of ART, and systematic reviews of African studies have found high rates of
pre-ART attrition [6,8,29,30]. In Haiti, data on pre-ART outcomes are limited, but 12-month
retention after ART initiation is 73% nationwide [31]. We attribute the higher retention in our
study in large part to faster ART initiation, even in the standard group, compared to many
other HIV programs. We surmise that retention would have been lower in the standard group
if there had been longer delays in ART initiation [5,11,30].
The rates of retention with viral suppression in our study are lower than those reported
from clinical trial cohorts, including at GHESKIO. In the GHESKIO Clinical Trials Unit,
with a median monthly average of 483 subjects participating in NIH-funded clinical trials,
retention is 97%. We attribute the lower retention and viral suppression rates in our study
to 2 major reasons. First, nearly all patients meeting WHO stage and CD4 criteria were
enrolled in the study on the day of HIV testing, including those with substantial barriers to
retention in care and adherence. In contrast, over one-third of patients are generally lost to
care prior to ART initiation or enrollment in clinical trials [6,8,29,30]. Second, the care that
was provided in this study was similar to that received by nonstudy patients at GHESKIO,
with the aim of producing findings that could be reproduced in other resource-poor set-
tings. In order to achieve the UNAIDS 90-90-90 targets, it will be important to evaluate rea-
sons for attrition and implement new strategies to improve retention in care. One approach
that has been successful in a cohort of nonresearch patients at GHESKIO has been expe-
dited follow-up care, with fewer visits of shorter duration for clinically stable patients [32].
Streamlined care has also been associated with high rates of retention in the SEARCH
study, which is described above [23].
Our study was conducted in a large urban clinic, which may limit the generalizability of our
findings. In addition, though our study included patients with early clinical disease, the CD4
counts in our population were lower than would be expected with the provision of universal
ART. It is possible that patients with higher CD4 counts may experience less benefit from
same-day ART. It is also noteworthy that we conducted a chest x-ray prior to enrollment; if
same-day ART is provided without a chest x-ray, it is possible that TB cases will be missed.
Our study was not blinded. All participants in both groups received the same number of visits
and the same retention plan, but we cannot exclude the possibility that awareness of study
group impacted provider behavior.
In conclusion, in a population of asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic HIV-infected
patients, same-day HIV testing and ART initiation decreased mortality and improved the rate
of retention in care with virologic suppression compared with standard ART initiation. Fur-
thermore, human and material resources provided to each group were similar, so same-day
ART is not expected to increase treatment costs. The new WHO recommendations to provide
ART to all HIV-infected patients should facilitate same-day test and treat.
