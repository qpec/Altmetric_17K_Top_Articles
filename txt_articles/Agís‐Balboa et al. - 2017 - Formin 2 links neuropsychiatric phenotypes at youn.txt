Abstract
Age-associated memory decline is due to variable combinations of
genetic and environmental risk factors. How these risk factors inter-
act to drive disease onset is currently unknown. Here we begin to
elucidate the mechanisms by which post-traumatic stress disorder
(PTSD) at a young age contributes to an increased risk to develop
dementia at old age. We show that the actin nucleator Formin 2
(Fmn2) is deregulated in PTSD and in Alzheimer’s disease (AD)
patients. Young mice lacking the Fmn2 gene exhibit PTSD-like
phenotypes and corresponding impairments of synaptic plasticity,
while the consolidation of new memories is unaffected. However,
Fmn2 mutant mice develop accelerated age-associated memory
decline that is further increased in the presence of additional risk
factors and is mechanistically linked to a loss of transcriptional
homeostasis. In conclusion, our data present a new approach to
explore the connection between AD risk factors across life span and
provide mechanistic insight to the processes by which neuropsychi-
atric diseases at a young age affect the risk for developing dementia.

Introduction
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative
disorder causing a huge emotional and economical burden to our
societies. The vast majority of AD cases are sporadic and arise on
the background of variable genetic and environmental risk factors.
There is substantial evidence that pathological changes occur years
before the onset of clinical symptoms (Bateman et al, 2012). To
elucidate how the different risk factors contribute to disease onset is
therefore of utmost importance. The starting point of this study is
epidemiological data indicating that individuals suffering from
neuropsychiatric
diseases
such
post-traumatic
stress
disorder
(PTSD) at a young age have an increased risk of developing AD in
old age (Yaffe et al, 2010; Burri et al, 2013; Weiner et al, 2013;
Stilling et al, 2014a). PTSD develops in response to a traumatic
event when normal psychological defense mechanisms fail. Individ-
uals that suffer from PTSD are deficient in learning that a stimulus
associated with an adverse event no longer presents a threat, a
process that requires cognitive flexibility and extinction learning
(Goswami et al, 2013). Memory extinction can be analyzed in
rodents using the well-established fear conditioning paradigm. This
paradigm represents a specific form of learning that underlies the
reduction of previously acquired fear memories (Myers & Davis,

 2002; Lattal et al, 2006; Sananbenesi et al, 2007; Fischer & Tsai,
2008; Radulovic & Tronson, 2010). Although impaired fear extinc-
tion in rodents does not recapitulate the complex phenotypes
observed in humans suffering from PTSD, it is suitable to study the
mechanisms that underlie increased susceptibility to PTSD. Thus,
we reasoned that a promising strategy to elucidate the molecular
mechanisms that link PTSD at a young age to an increased risk for
age-associated memory decline and AD would be to screen for
animal models that exhibit (i) impaired fear extinction at young age,
while consolidation of new memories is still intact, but (ii) develop
accelerated memory impairment in the presence of additional AD
risk factors. By this, we identified the Formin 2 (Fmn2) gene. FMN2
is best known for its role in regulating actin dynamics (Schuh, 2011)
and was previously detected in a screen for genes that are deregu-
lated in the aging mouse hippocampus (Peleg et al, 2010). In addi-
tion, FMN2 has been linked to synapse formation and deletion
mutations of the Fmn2 gene are associated with intellectual disabil-
ity, pointing to a role for Fmn2 in memory function in mice and
humans (Peleg et al, 2010; Almuqbil et al, 2013; Law et al, 2014).
Here we show that loss of Fmn2 affects plasticity at the mossy fiber-
CA3 synapse and causes impaired fear extinction in young mice. We
furthermore show that Fmn2 expression is decreased in PTSD
patients and in post-mortem brain samples from AD patients. Loss
of Fmn2 accelerates age-associated memory decline, which is
further accelerated in the presence of amyloid pathology and is
accompanied by deregulation of hippocampal gene expression.
While the mechanisms that link reduced FMN2 levels to aberrant
gene expression are likely to be multifactorial, we provide evidence
that FMN2-dependent synaptic actin dynamics signal via the ERK1/
2 pathway to drive Elk1 and SP1-dependent gene expression. Of
note, memory impairment in all employed models is ameliorated
after oral administration of the HDAC inhibitor Vorinostat. In sum,
our data represent a new approach to explore the cross-talk between
AD risk factors across life span and provide evidence that loss of
transcriptional plasticity is a key event down-stream of AD risk
factor exposure.
Results
Loss of FMN2 leads to impaired fear extinction in young mice
We started our analysis by employing animal models for age-asso-
ciated memory decline and tested whether extinction phenotypes
precede the impairment of memory consolidation. We decided to
test APPPS1-21 and 5xFAD mice, two well-established mouse
models for amyloid deposition and age-associated memory impair-
ment that are linked to familiar Alzheimer’s disease (Radde et al,
2006; Ohno et al, 2007; Govindarajan et al, 2013). In addition, we
employed Fmn2 knockout (Fmn2�/�) mice. Although the role of
FMN2 in the adult brain is not well understood, FMN2 has recently
been linked to age-related memory impairment in mice (Peleg et al,
2010) and is associated with cognitive dysfunction in humans
(Almuqbil et al, 2013; Law et al, 2014). Mice from all experimental
groups were subjected to contextual fear conditioning training at
3 month of age. Freezing behavior, indicative of associative memory
consolidation, was similar in all mutant mice when compared to the
corresponding control groups during a memory test performed 24 h
later (Fig 1A). To test extinction of fear memory, animals were re-
exposed to the conditioning context on consecutive days in the
absence of the foot shock, a procedure that induces extinction learn-
ing and leads to the reduction in the aversive freezing response
(Sananbenesi et al, 2007; Tronson et al, 2012). Fear extinction was
similar in APPPS1-21 (Fig 1B) and 5xFAD mice (Fig 1C) when
compared to the corresponding control groups. In contrast, fear
extinction learning was impaired in Fmn2�/� mice (Fig 1D). Next
we confirmed that all three lines of mutant mice exhibit impaired
consolidation of new memories already at 8 months of age (Fig 1E),
while wild-type mice were impaired only at 16 months of age
(Fig 1F). These data indicate that Fmn2�/� mice develop deficits in
fear extinction that precede impairment of memory consolidation.
However, the possibility remained that the employed fear condition-
ing protocol does not allow for the detection of very mild memory
impairments. Therefore, we also subjected Fmn2�/� mice to a
milder fear conditioning protocol (Kerimoglu et al, 2013). In line
with our initial observation, Fmn2�/� mice did not exhibit memory
impairment at 3 months of age (see Appendix Fig S1). In line with
these data, 3-month-old Fmn2�/� mice were able to acquire spatial
reference memory in the Morris water maze test similar to wild-type
mice (Fig EV1A and B). Reversal learning was, however, impaired
(Fig EV1C and D), which supports the view that loss of Fmn2 in
young mice does not affect the consolidation of new memories but
is required for changing responses to existing memories. Taking
together, these data support the view that the analysis of FMN2
would be a good starting point to investigate the mechanisms by
which neuropsychiatric diseases at young age contribute to an
increased risk for age-associative memory decline. Before continu-
ing our analysis, however, we sought to provide further evidence
for this hypothesis. To this end, we tested Fmn2 expression in blood
samples from PTSD patients via qPCR. We observed a significant
reduction in Fmn2 expression in PTSD patients when compared to
age-matched
control
individuals
(Zieker
et al,
2007;
Fig 1G).
Although care has to be taken when interpreting data obtained from
blood in the context of brain diseases, there is increasing evidence
that adverse life events can induce long-lasting changes in the
expression of specific genes and that such changes in gene expres-
sion are detected in various cell types such as cells obtained from
blood or saliva (Smith et al, 2015). Thus, the analysis of gene
expression, for example, in blood, is viewed as a suitable approach
to identify biomarker and surrogate marker for brain diseases (Rao
et al, 2013; Ciobanu et al, 2016; Schmitt et al, 2016). The fact that
Fmn2 levels are altered in blood samples from PTSD patients there-
fore indicates that exposure to PTSD-inducing events may similarly
altered Fmn2 levels in the brain. Since we do not have access to suit-
able post-mortem tissue from PTSD patients, this hypothesis remains
to be tested. However, PTSD and other neuropsychiatric diseases
have been linked to altered glucocorticoid signaling (Du & Pang,
2015; Kim et al, 2015). It is therefore interesting that Fmn2 expres-
sion was decreased in human neuronal progenitor cells subjected to
acute or chronic dexamethasone treatment, a synthetic glucocorti-
coid that can have detrimental effects on neuronal function and
cognitive abilities (Crochemore et al, 2005; Tongjaroenbuangam
et al, 2013; Feng et al, 2015; Lanshakov et al, 2016; Fig 1H). We
also observed decreased Fmn2 expression in post-mortem human
brain samples (hippocampus) from AD patients when compared to
age-matched control individuals (Fig 1I).

 Encouraged by these observations, we decided to study the role
of FMN2 in the adult brain in greater detail. Fmn2 was highly
expressed in mouse and human hippocampal neurons (Fig 2A). In
line with these findings, robust FMN2 protein levels were observed
in the mouse and human hippocampus (Fig 2B). The specificity of
the FMN2 antibody employed for immunoblotting was confirmed
using corresponding hippocampal tissue from Fmn2�/� mice as
negative control (Fig 2C). Since we could not identify a suitable
antibody to reliably detect FMN2 via immunostaining, we generated
Fmn2-EGFP knock-in mice. These mice are healthy and show no
obvious phenotype (see Appendix Fig S1B and C). The analysis of
FMN2 protein localization in FMN2-EGFP knock-in mice confirmed
high levels of FMN2 protein in the hippocampus and especially in
the mossy fiber pathway (Fig 2D), suggesting that FMN2 can
localize to the pre-synaptic compartment. In line with this, we
detected robust levels of FMN2 in hippocampal synaptosomes
(Fig 2E). Furthermore, the pre-synaptic marker protein synapto-
porin co-localized with FMN2 within the stratum lucidum of the
hippocampal CA3 region (Fig 2E).
These data suggest that the susceptibility to develop PTSD-like
phenotypes
observed
in
3-month-old
Fmn2�/�
mice
involves
compromised
plasticity
at
the
hippocampal
mossy
fiber-CA3
synapse. Thus, we analyzed the electrophysiological properties of
mossy fiber synapses in Fmn2�/� mice at 3 months of age. We
found that long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression
(LTD) were unaffected (Fig 2F and G). However, Fmn2�/� mice
exhibited impaired depotentiation, a well-established phenomenon
by which mossy fiber-CA3 LTP can be reversed using long trains of
low-frequency stimulation that has been discussed as a molecular
correlate of extinction processes (Hong et al, 2009; Kim et al, 2009;
Fig 2H).
Although gross brain morphology, motor coordination, explo-
rative behavior, and basal anxiety were similar when comparing
3-month-old Fmn2�/� mice and control littermates (Fig EV2), our
Fmn2�/� mice constitutively lack FMN2. Thus, the possibility
remained that the observed fear extinction phenotype could in
part be due to subtle development abnormalities and in addition
may not be specific to hippocampal function. To test for this
possibility, we employed an RNAi approach and found that RNAi-
mediated decrease in FMN2 in the hippocampus impairs fear
extinction,
but
has
no
effect
on
the
consolidation
of
new
memories. To this end, we first confirmed that intra-hippocampal
injection of an siRNA against Fmn2 reduces Fmn2 mRNA and
protein levels when compared to the scramble control group

 (Fig 3A–C). Next we subjected mice to contextual fear condition-
ing and injected siRNA or scrambled control RNA for 3 days
(every 12 h) before animals were subjected to fear extinction
(Fig 3D). Injections were continued during extinction trials 1-3.
Extinction was significantly impaired when comparing the siRNA
versus the scramble control RNA-injected mice (Fig 3E). When
animals were allowed to rest for 6 days after extinction trial 4 and
did not receive further injections, normal extinction behavior was
observed when mice
were subsequently subjected to further
extinction
training.
These
data
indicate
that
siRNA-mediated
impairment of extinction is not due to unspecific effects of the
injection procedure (Fig 3D and E). Finally, we show that siRNA-
mediated knockdown of Fmn2 does not affect the acquisition of
contextual fear memories (Fig 3F).
In conclusion, these data indicate that loss of FMN2 leads to
impaired fear extinction which is accompanied by mild deficits in
neuronal plasticity that mimic the behavioral alterations.
Loss of FMN2 leads to accelerated age-associated
memory impairment
Next, we decided to explore the mechanisms by which FMN2-
mediated phenotypes at a young age increase risk for late life
dementia. We first confirmed our observation that 8-month-old
Fmn2�/� mice exhibit impaired memory formation (see Fig 1E) in
an additional memory test, namely the hippocampus-dependent
Morris water maze paradigm. There was no difference in the escape
latency
when
comparing
3-
versus
8-month
Fmn2+/+
mice
(Fig 4A). However, 8-month-old Fmn2�/� mice were significantly
impaired when compared to age-matched wild-type mice (Fig 4B).
This finding was confirmed in a probe test performed after 10 days
of training. While 3- and 8-month-old wild-type mice showed a
significant preference for the target quadrant, 8-month-old Fmn2�/�
mice were significantly impaired (Fig 4B). These data confirm that
loss of Fmn2 accelerates age-associative memory impairment. Next

 we decided to investigate the impact of FMN2 on cognitive decline
in the presence of another risk factor for AD, namely amyloid depo-
sition. To this end, we employed APPPS1-21 mice. We observed that
3-month-old APPPS1-21 mice subjected to the open-field test and
the contextual fear conditioning paradigm showed explorative
(Fig 4C) and freezing behavior that was similar to wild-type mice,
suggesting that at 3 months of age APPPS1-21 mice show no defect
in associative memory formation (Fig 4D). Thus, we reasoned that
the analysis in 3-month-old mice would enable us to detect synergis-
tic effects on memory impairment in Fmn2�/� and APPPS1-21 mice.
To this end, we crossed Fmn2�/� mice with APPPS1-21 (APP) mice
and tested memory function in animals at 3 months of age. As
expected, brain weight was not affected (see Appendix Fig S2).
Moreover, explorative behavior in the open-field test did not
differ significantly amongst groups (Fig 4C). When subjected to
the fear conditioning paradigm, neither 3-month-old Fmn2�/� nor
APPPS1-21 mice showed impaired freezing behavior in comparison
with control littermates (Fig 4D). Freezing behavior was, however,
significantly impaired in 3-month-old Fmn2�/�_APPPS-21 mice
(Fig 4D). Next we assayed spatial memory in the Morris water maze
paradigm. All groups were able to acquire spatial memory through-
out the 8 days of training (Fig 4E). When subjected to the probe
test, all groups except Fmn2�/�_APPPS1-21 mice showed a signifi-
cant preference for the target quadrant (Fig 4F). In conclusion, these
data show that reduced levels of FMN2 further accelerate memory
decline in a mouse model for aging and in a model for amyloid
deposition.
Loss of FMN2 accelerates age- and amyloid-induced deregulation
of gene expression
We have previously hypothesized that the various AD risk factors
eventually cause aberrant gene expression, thereby contributing to
the loss of homeostasis and memory decline (Sananbenesi &
Fischer, 2009; Fischer, 2014). To test whether this hypothesis could
help to explain how loss of Fmn2 at young age contributes to age-
associative memory decline, we employed the hippocampal DG
region for RNA-sequencing. First we compared gene expression
levels in 3-month-old Fmn2�/� mice and age-matched control
littermates. In addition to the Fmn2 gene, we detected only 26
differentially
expressed
sequences
(Fig 5A;
Dataset
EV1).
Nevertheless, GO-term and functional pathway analysis identified
“oxidative phosphorylation”—and especially subunits of the NADH
dehydrogenase and ATPase—to be increased (Fig 5B and C). When
we compared the gene expression in cognitively impaired 8-month-
old Fmn2�/� mice to age-matched control littermates, we detected
461 differentially expressed genes, of which the majority were
down-regulated (Fig 5A). GO-term and pathway analysis revealed
that the genes deregulated were linked to ribosome function, RNA
splicing,
Alzheimer’s
disease,
and
oxidative
phosphorylation
(Fig 5D and F). While genes linked to oxidative phosphorylation
were increased in 3-month-old mice, genes of the same complexes
and especially genes encoding subunits of the NADH dehydroge-
nase, ATPase, and Cytochrome C
reductase were all down-
regulated in 8-month-old mice (Fig 5E, Dataset EV1). These data
suggest that the susceptibility to develop PTSD-like phenotypes
observed in 3-month-old Fmn2�/� mice is not accompanied by
massive changes in gene expression, while memory impairment in
8-month-old Fmn2�/� mice correlates with substantial deregulation
of transcriptome plasticity. The fact that the spliceosome appeared
to be deregulated in 8-month-old Fmn2�/� mice is in line with
recent data suggesting that during aging, synaptic plasticity genes
are deregulated at the level of differential exon usage (Stilling et al,
2014b; Benito et al, 2015). Thus, we also analyzed differential exon
usage. In 3-month-old Fmn2�/� mice, we detected 46 genes that
showed altered differential exon usage when compared to 3-month-
old
control
littermates
(Fig 5G,
Dataset
EV1).
No
significant
pathways were identified. The same comparison was performed in
8-month-old Fmn2�/� and age-matched control mice and revealed
286 differentially expressed exons (Fig 5G). Further GO-term and
pathways analysis showed that processes affected by differential
splicing in 8-month-old Fmn2�/� mice are linked to synapse func-
tion (Fig 5H). In line with the gene expression data, we also
observed that processes linked to energy metabolism and oxidative
phosphorylation were deregulated (Fig 5H). In conclusion, these
data indicate that the PTSD-like phenotypes observed in Fmn2�/�
mice are not linked to substantial changes in gene expression,
while aberrant gene expression is accelerated in the context of
aging as an additional AD risk factor. To further substantiate this
finding, we also analyzed gene expression in the DG of 3-month-
old
Fmn2�/�_APPPS-21.

Fmn2 mRNA levels were determined in the hippocampus of mice injected with either scrambled or Fmn2 siRNA via qPCR (n = 4/group). Fmn2 levels are reduced in

Experimental design. Microcannulae were implanted into the hippocampus of wild-type mice. All mice were subsequently subjected to contextual fear conditioning
training. Fmn2 siRNA or scrambled control RNA was injected into the dentate gyrus 24 h later and then every 12 h for 3 days. On subsequent days, mice were
subjected to extinction trial (E)1, E2, E3, and E4 (panel B). The injection protocol was continued until E3.

 revealed 50 differentially expressed genes, while 268 differentially
expressed genes were detected comparing 3-month-old APPPS1-21
mice to age-matched Fmn2�/�_APPPS1-21 mice (Fig 5I). The genes
affected in 3-month-old APPPS1-21 mice were mainly linked to
pathways representing inflammatory processes (Fig 5J). The top
pathways affected in Fmn2�/�_APPPS1-21 mice when compared to
APPPS1-21 mice were mainly linked to metabolic processes,
suggesting that loss of Fmn2 does not accelerate Ab-induced
inflammation but is associated with deregulation of general cellular
processes.
In sum, these findings show that loss of FMN2 in young mice
leaves the hippocampal transcriptome rather unaffected. However,
chronically
reduced
FMN2
levels
accelerate
deregulation
of
hippocampal transcriptome plasticity in response to aging or
amyloid deposition.
Since our data indicate that FMN2 is a synaptic protein, we
hypothesize that chronically low levels of FMN2 will eventually
affect pathways linked to synapse-to-nucleus signaling (Jordan &
Kreutz, 2009). FMN2 has been implicated with the regulation of
actin dynamics, and it is interesting to note that changes in actin
polymerization were found to signal to the nucleus and thereby
induce gene expression changes (Olson & Nordheim, 2010). In
line with this, we observed that hippocampal actin dynamics
were altered in Fmn2�/� mice (Fig EV3A). When we analyzed
the
promoter
regions
of
genes
deregulated
in
8-month-old
Fmn2�/� mice for the presence of any consensus sequences, we
observed a significant enrichment for the motifs “CCCGCCCC”
and “CCGGAAGC” which represents the ETS family of transcrip-
tion factors (e.g., ELK) and the transcription factor specificity
protein 1 (SP1), respectively (Fig EV3B). This is interesting, since
SP1 and ELK have been linked to memory function and Alzhei-
mer’s
disease
(Sananbenesi
et al,
2002;
Sung
et al,
2013;
Szatmari et al, 2013; Citron et al, 2015; Wei et al, 2016) and are
—amongst
other
kinases—activated
via
ERK1/2
(Bonello
&
Khachigian, 2004; Salim et al, 2007; Besnard et al, 2011; Kim
et al, 2012). ERK1/2 is highly expressed in the mossy fiber
pathway (Hu et al, 2004; Provenzano et al, 2014); has been
linked to
memory function, fear
extinction,
and
Alzheimer’s
disease (Sweatt, 2004; Fischer et al, 2007; Kim & Choi, 2015);
interacts with the actin cytoskeleton; and translocates to the
nucleus upon stimulation (Wang & Hatton, 2007; Berti & Seger,
2017). It is thus tempting to hypothesize that chronically reduced
FMN2 levels cause subtle change to the actin cytoskeleton that

A probe test revealed that the time spent in the target quadrant significantly differed amongst groups (P = 0.0004, F = 9.4; one-way ANOVA) and that 8-month-old
Fmn2�/� mice (n = 20) spent significantly reduced time in the target quadrant when compared directly to age-matched (*P = 0.0143, n = 20, post hoc analysis) or
3-month-old Fmn2+/+ mice (***P < 0.0001, n = 12, post hoc analysis).
C
Left panel: The total distance traveled during a 5-min open-field exposure did not differ significantly amongst groups (n = 8/group). Right panel: The time spent in

amongst groups (P = 0.0005, F = 6.947, one-way ANOVA) and was significantly impaired in APPPS1-21_Fmn2�/� mice when compared to the other groups
(***P < 0.0001, post hoc analysis).

Escape latency in the water maze test in 3-month-old Fmn2+/+ (n = 15), APPPS1-21 (n = 15), APPPS1-21_Fmn2�/� (n = 15), and Fmn2�/� mice (n = 15). Comparing
the learning curves amongst all groups revealed no significant difference.
F
During the probe test, there was a significant difference amongst groups in the time spent in the target quadrant (P = 0.04, F = 3.22, one-way ANOVA). Except for
APPPS1-21_Fmn2�/� mice (n = 15), all groups showed a significant preference for the target quadrant (*P < 0.05, post hoc analysis). A direct comparison between
Fmn2�/� (n = 15) and APPPS1-21_Fmn2�/� mice (n = 15) revealed a significant reduction in the latter group (*P = 0.017).

In
line
with
this
hypothesis,
we
observed that FMN2 and ERK1/2 interact and colocalize at the
mossy
fiber
synapse
(Fig EV3C–F)
and
that
levels
of
active
ERK1/2, SP1, and ELK1 are reduced in 8-month-old Fmn2�/�
mice (Fig EV3D). Although these data suggest one possible link
between loss of FMN2 function and aberrant gene expression
(Fig EV3G),
certainly
also
other
processes
contribute
to
this
phenotype. Irrespective of the multifactorial processes that link
decreased FMN2 levels to aberrant gene expression, it is interest-
ing
to
note
that
drugs
aiming
to
state
physiological
gene
expression such as
inhibitors of histone-deacetylases (HDAC)
were shown to improve learning behavior in mouse models for
age-associated memory decline and amyloid deposition (Guan
et al, 2009; Kilgore et al, 2010; Peleg et al, 2010; Govindarajan
et al, 2011; Benito et al, 2015). Therefore, we wondered if HDAC
inhibitors may also help to improve memory function in 8-month-
old Fmn2�/� mice and in 3-month-old Fmn2�/�_APPPS-21 mice.
Vorinostat rescues memory impairment in aged Fmn2�/� and
Fmn2�/�_APP mice
Vorinostat (SAHA) is an FDA-approved HDAC inhibitor with benefi-
cial effect on memory function (Kilgore et al, 2010; Benito et al,
2015). Thus, we decided to test its effect in aged Fmn2�/� mice
and in Fmn2�/�_APPPS1-21 mice. First, we treated 7-month-old
Fmn2�/� mice orally with Vorinostat (50 mg/kg) or placebo for
4 weeks. Explorative behavior measured in the open-field test was
similar amongst groups (Fig 6A). Basal anxiety analyzed by compar-
ing the center activity in the open field (Fig 6B) and by subjecting
animals to the elevated plus maze test was also similar amongst
groups
(Fig 6C).
Next
we
analyzed
hippocampus-dependent
associative memory in the contextual fear conditioning paradigm.

test
was

 maze paradigm. When compared to the placebo group, Fmn2�/�
mice treated with Vorinostat showed a significantly improved
escape latency, indicative of improved spatial memory formation
(Fig 6E). Swim speed was similar amongst groups (Fig 6E). During
the probe test, only Vorinostat-treated Fmn2�/� mice showed a
significant preference for the target quadrant (Fig 6F). We also
tested the expression of selected genes linked to oxidative phospho-
rylation that were down-regulated in the DG of 8-month-old
Fmn2�/� mice when compared to wild-type control littermates (see
Fig 5). All selected genes were increased in the Vorinostat group
when compared to placebo-treated Fmn2�/� mice (Fig 6G). HDAC
inhibitors can affect gene expression by changing histone-acetyla-
tion. Reduced acetylation of histone 4 lysine 12 (H4K12ac) has been
previously linked to age-associated memory decline (Guan et al,
2009; Peleg et al, 2010; Benito et al, 2015). In line with the gene
expression data, we observed reduced H4K12ac in aged Fmn2�/�
mice, which was, however, increased in mice treated with Vorinos-
tat (Fig EV4). To further substantiate these findings, we performed
a similar experiment in Fmn2�/�_APPPS1-21 mice. Two-month-old
Fmn2�/�_APPPS1-21 mice were treated orally with either Vorinostat
or placebo. Placebo-treated APP mice served as an additional
control. Behavior in the open-field and elevated plus maze test did
not differ amongst groups. However, similar to the findings in aged
Fmn2�/� mice, we observed that Vorinostat treatment was able to
ameliorate memory deficits, H4K12ac and gene expression in
Fmn2�/�_APPPS1-21 (Figs EV4 and EV5).
Discussion
Our study was inspired by the observation that young individuals
suffering from psychiatric diseases such as PTSD have an increased
risk to develop AD as they age (Yaffe et al, 2010; Burri et al, 2013;
Weiner et al, 2013). We reasoned that one possible way to begin
elucidating this phenomenon would be to select genes that have
been implicated with age-associative memory decline and to test
whether these genes may also play a role in the development of
PTSD-like phenotypes, which we analyzed in mice via fear extinc-
tion as a commonly used and robust paradigm. Nevertheless, we
like to reiterate that results from animal models of neuropsychiatric
diseases have to be interpreted with care, and while impaired fear
extinction in rodents may point to the mechanisms that underlie
increased susceptibility for PTSD, it does not fully recapitulate the
phenotypes observed in PTSD patients. We observed that deficits in
fear extinction precede memory decline in Fmn2�/� mice, and
moreover, Fmn2 expression was decreased in PTSD and AD patients

 and decided to follow up on this novel observation. We found that
Fmn2 is highly expressed in neurons of the mouse and human
hippocampus and is especially enriched in the hippocampal mossy
fiber pathway, where it is localized to pre-synaptic terminals. These
data are in line with previous in situ hybridization findings showing
that in the adult mouse brain Fmn2 expression is highest in the
hippocampal dentate gyrus (Schumacher et al, 2004). Nevertheless,
it is likely that posttranslational mechanisms contribute to the
enrichment of FMN2 at the mossy fibers. Interestingly, loss of Fmn2
had no effect on LTP or LTD at the mossy fiber-CA3 synapse. Taking
into account that LTP and LTD have been considered as molecular
correlates of memory consolidation, these data are in agreement
with the fact that young Fmn2 mutant mice have no deficit in the
consolidation of new memories. However, depotentiation was
impaired in Fmn2�/� mice. It is tempting to link this observation to
the behavioral phenotypes. Hence, at the synaptic and the behav-
ioral level, mice that lack Fmn2 at a young age are able to induce
plasticity-related processes that are essential for information stor-
age, but are impaired in modifying this information subsequently.
These data are in line with previous studies, suggesting that depo-
tentiation in the amygdala is required for fear extinction (Hong et al,
2009; Kim et al, 2009). The precise mechanisms by which loss of
FMN2 affects depotentiation remain to be investigated. However,
depotentiation has been linked to altered actin dynamics which in
turn affects multiple synaptic processes such as vesicle trafficking
(Galvez et al, 2016). We suggest that future research should test if
such processes play a role in FMN2-mediated fear extinction.
However, impaired depotentiation is certainly not the only process
responsible for impaired fear extinction in Fmn2�/� mice.
A key observation of our study is that chronically reduced levels
of Fmn2 accelerate age-associative memory decline. The fact that in
young Fmn2�/� mice the formation of hippocampus-dependent
memories is not affected suggests that memory decline observed
during aging is most likely an indirect consequence of the molecular
changes triggered by chronically reduced FMN2 function. We
hypothesize that such changes eventually lead to altered gene
expression
contributing
to
memory
impairment.
Indeed,
we
observed neglectable changes in hippocampal gene expression in
3-month-old Fmn2�/� mice, while loss of Fmn2 dramatically
increases the number of deregulated genes during aging or in
response to amyloid pathology. These data support our idea that AD
risk factors synergistically drive aberrant gene expression and
thereby eventually contribute to dementia (Fig 7). Importantly,
neither amyloid deposition nor FMN2 are likely to affect gene
expression directly. While the precise mechanisms that couple
FMN2-mediated defects in hippocampal function to deregulation of
gene expression are likely multifactorial, it is interesting to note that
stimuli which promote rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton were
found to induce gene expression changes (Olson & Nordheim, 2010).
In line with this, we observe that loss of FMN2 affects actin dynam-
ics which confirms previous data from other cellular systems
(Pfender
et al,
2011;
Schuh,
2011;
Montaville
et al,
2016;
Sahasrabudhe et al, 2016) and is in agreement with the fact that
blocking actin dynamics in the hippocampus impairs fear extinction
(Fischer et al, 2004). Alteration of actin dynamics has been
associated with ERK1/2-mediated changes in gene expression (Wang
& Hatton, 2007; Berti & Seger, 2017). Indeed, we found reduced
ERK1/2 activity in Fmn2�/� mice. The finding that ERK1/2 activates
the transcription factors ELK1 and SP1 is in line with our data
showing that binding sites for these factors are enriched amongst
the genes deregulated in aged Fmn2�/� mice (Fig EV3G). However,
there are other processes linking synaptic plasticity to gene
Figure 7.
AD risk factors cause loss of gene expression control.
Our central hypothesis is that the various AD risk factors eventually lead to aberrant gene expression and loss of transcriptional control. This is based on the assumption
that proper gene expression is a core feature of cellular homeostasis and that changes occurring at various compartments of the cell (e.g., at the synapse) will eventually
signal to the nucleus and cause gene expression changes. In the case of FMN2, we provide, for example, evidence that chronically low levels of FMN2 disturb synaptic
actin dynamics and thereby affect ERK1/2-dependent gene expression programs. Thus, even if an AD risk factor may play no direct role in gene expression, it may
eventually contribute to a loss of transcriptional plasticity. We therefore suggest that targeting pathological gene expression could be a suitable therapeutic approach,
especially for multifactorial diseases such as AD, where it is nearly impossible to determine all of the genetic and environmental factors that eventually contribute to
clinical phenotypes.

 expression (Jordan & Kreutz, 2009) that likely also contribute to a
loss
of
transcriptional
homeostasis.
The
view
that
disturbed
transcriptome plasticity causatively contributes to memory loss is
supported by our observation that the HDAC inhibitor Vorinostat
reinstates hippocampal memory formation in aged Fmn2�/� mice
and also in APPPS1-21 mice that lack Fmn2.
In conclusion, our data provide insight to the molecular mecha-
nisms by which neuropsychiatric diseases at a young age lead to an
increased risk for dementia when individuals age. We suggest that
our experimental approach should be applied to additional genes
and environmental factors implicated with PTSD or other neuropsy-
chiatric diseases. Our data also provide a more general insight of
how the various AD risk factors (in our case, FMN2-mediated PTSD-
like phenotypes, amyloid deposition, and aging) contribute to
dementia. Targeting transcriptome plasticity would thus be a very
suitable therapeutic approach that is independent of the precise
knowledge to the upstream pathological events (Fig 7). In line with
this, we show that the HDAC inhibitor Vorinostat reinstates
hippocampal memory formation in aged Fmn2�/� mice and also in
APPPS1-21 mice that lack Fmn2. Of course, we cannot exclude that
the memory enhancing effect of Vorinostat also involves processes
not directly related to gene expression. It is, however, interesting to
note that HDAC inhibitors are also discussed as a novel therapeutic
avenue to treat PTSD (Whittle & Singewald, 2014). In fact, Vorinos-
tat not only improves memory function, but also facilitates extinc-
tion of fear memories (Whittle et al, 2013), a finding we could
confirm in our paradigm (see Appendix Fig S3). Our data therefore
indicate that it might be possible to develop therapeutic strategies
for PTSD patients that at the same time lower the risk to develop
Alzheimer’s disease, a line of research that should also be taken into
consideration for other neuropsychiatric diseases.
Materials and Methods
For detailed description of methods, see the Appendix Supplemen-
tary Methods.
Animals and human tissue
Male mice were housed under standard conditions with free access
to food and water. All experiments were carried out in accordance
with the animal protection law and were approved by the District
Government of Germany. Fmn2�/� and APPPS-21 mice have been
described before (Leader et al, 2002; Radde et al, 2006). Three-, 12-,
and 16-month-old wild-type mice were obtained from Janvier Labs.
Post-mortem hippocampal tissue from AD patients and controls was
obtained with ethical approval from the Alzheimer’s disease
Research Center Brain bank at Massachusetts General Hospital,
Boson, MA, and from Brigham & Women’s Hospital Autopsy
Service, Boston, MA, USA. Samples were matched for age and post-
mortem delay. AD patients Braak and Braak stage were 3–5. EDTA
blood samples from PTSD patients and controls were from the
Ramstein cohort described previously (Zieker et al, 2007). These
individuals were exposed to the trauma of the air show catastrophe
in Ramstein, Germany, 1988. We employed nine age- and gender-
matched controls (46.38 � 4.363 years of age) and seven PTSD
patients (52.29 � 5.515 years of age). Patients were diagnosed
according to DSM IV (SKID-I; Wittchen et al, 1997). Symptom
severity was measured using the German versions of the clinician-
administered PTSD scale [CAPS] (Schnyder & Moergeli, 2002;
mean = 40.0, SD = 22.9; > 40 moderate PTSD), the Posttraumatic
Stress Diagnostic Scale [PDS] (Foa et al, 1993; mean = 18.8,
SD = 11.1; > 20 moderate to severe PTSD), the 22-item Impact of
Event Scale Revised [IES-R] (Horowitz et al, 1979; mean = 48.0,
SD = 18.7), and the Questionnaire on Dissociative Symptoms [FDS]
(Freyberger et al, 1999; mean = 9.8, SD = 8.5; > 8.4 dissociative
symptoms). To characterize possible comorbidity with a depressive
disorder, the German version of the Beck Depression Inventory
[BDI] (Hautzinger, 1991) was performed (mean = 14.3, SD = 9.1;
> 18 relevant depression). None of the patients had been taking
psychoactive drugs on a regular basis 3 months prior to the study.
All experiments were approved by the local ethical committees, and
tissue/blood samples were obtained upon informed consent.
Behavior analysis
Mice were subjected to a series of behavioral tests as described
before (Kerimoglu et al, 2013).
Cannulation and siRNA injection
Intra-hippocampal injections were performed as described previ-
ously (Bahari-Javan et al, 2012).
Statistical analysis
Unless specifically mentioned otherwise, data were analyzed by
unpaired Student’s t-test, two tailed t-test, Bonferroni test for multi-
ple comparisons, or one and two-way and ANOVA (analysis of
variance) when appropriate. Errors are displayed as standard error
of mean (SEM). Unless otherwise stated, analysis was performed
using GraphPad Prism.
