Multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) have a fibrous structure and physical
properties similar to asbestos and have been shown to induce malignant
mesothelioma of the peritoneum after injection into the scrotum or peritoneal
cavity in rats and mice. For human cancer risk assessment, however, data after
administration of MWCNT via the airway, the exposure route that is most rele-
vant to humans, is required. The present study was undertaken to investigate
the carcinogenicity of MWCNT-N (NIKKISO) after administration to the rat lung.
MWCNT-N was fractionated by passing it through a sieve with a pore size of
25 lm. The average lengths of the MWCNT were 4.2 lm before filtration and
2.6 lm in the flow-through fraction; the length of the retained MWCNT could
not be determined. For the present study, 10-week-old F344/Crj male rats were
divided into five groups: no treatment, vehicle control, MWCNT-N before filtra-
tion, MWCNT-N flow-through and MWCNT-N retained groups. Administration
was by the trans-tracheal intrapulmonary spraying (TIPS) method. Rats were
administered a total of 1 mg/rat during the initial 2 weeks of the experiment and
then observed up to 109 weeks. The incidences of malignant mesothelioma and
lung tumors (bronchiolo-alveolar adenomas and carcinomas) were 6/38 and 14/
38, respectively, in the three groups administered MWCNT and 0/28 and 0/28,
respectively, in the control groups. All malignant mesotheliomas were localized
in the pericardial pleural cavity. The sieve fractions did not have a significant
effect on tumor incidence. In conclusion, administration of MWCNT to the lung in
the rat induces malignant mesothelioma and lung tumors.
C
arbon nanotubes have a fibrous structure and physical
properties similar to asbestos.(1) Unlike spherical particles
and short fibers, long fibers cannot effectively pass from the
pleural cavity into the lymphatic system through pores in the
chest wall, resulting in deposition in the pleural cavity.(1) The
high concentrations of asbestos fibers, especially long thin
chrysotile fibers, that were found in the parietal pleura in
patients
with
plaques
and
malignant
mesotheliomas
by
Kohyama and Suzuki can be attributed to this fact.(2) The simi-
larity between multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) and
asbestos raises concern that the widespread use of MWCNT
may cause an asbestos-like pandemic of disease.(1,3)
Recent studies have shown that direct injection of MWCNT-
7 into the peritoneal cavity or the scrotum induced malignant
mesotheliomas in rats and mice.(4–7) While these administra-
tion routes are not directly applicable to human risk assess-
ment, as the exposure route in humans is by inhalation,(3,8)
other recent studies have demonstrated that MWCNT adminis-
tered to the lung translocates into the pleural cavity in mice
and rats.(9–16) Taken together, these studies illustrate that, like
asbestos, MWCNT is able to induce cancer of the mesothelium
and, when administered to the lung, is able to be translocated
from the lung into the pleural cavity.
Our studies have directly demonstrated that in rats MWCNT
administered to the lung by the trans-tracheal intrapulmonary
spraying (TIPS) method, an apposite antecedent to costly aero-
sol inhalation studies, translocated to the pleural cavity and
caused

 macrophages phagocytosing the MWCNT fibers, and hyper-
plastic proliferation of the visceral mesothelium.(11,16) Impor-
tantly, pleural translocation and induction of lesions in the
lung and pleura by MWCNT administered to the lung was size
and shape dependent.(16) Based on these findings, we con-
ducted the present study to investigate the possibility that
MWCNT-N administered to the lung is carcinogenic to the
pleura and lung. We also fractionated the MWCNT-N by pass-
ing it through a sieve with a pore size of 25 µm to investigate
whether there were any size-dependent effects on induction of
chronic inflammation or carcinogenesis associated with differ-
ent fiber lengths.
Materials and Methods
Preparation of the multiwalled carbon nanotube fractions. The
MWCNT-N, provided by NIKKISO, Tokyo, Japan, with an orig-
inal (at the production site) size of 3.5 µm in length and 1–
20 nm in diameter, was suspended in saline containing 0.5%
Pluronic F68 (PF68) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA),
which prevents aggregation of MWCNT,(17) to a final concentra-
tion of 250 µg/mL. We found that this formula has the best dis-
persing performance without having toxic effects in the lung
(Jiegou Xu, unpublished data). After adding MWCNT-N into
this dispersant, the mixture was homogenized for 1 min four
times at 3000 rpm in a Polytron PT1600E benchtop homoge-
nizer (Kinematika, Littau, Switzerland). Then, 50 mL of the
MWCNT-N suspension was fractionated by passing it through a
sieve with a pore size of 25 µm. The flow-through fraction was
centrifuged at 10 000 g for 30 min and the upper 40 mL of the
supernatant was removed. The MWCNT was homogenized and
the concentration of the MWCNT was determined by optical
density.(18) The MWCNT was brought to a final concentration of
250 µg/mL in 0.5% PF68. The retained fraction was resus-
pended in 20 mL 0.5% PF68, the concentration determined, and
the suspension was brought to a final concentration of 250 µg/
mL in 0.5% PF68. Photographs of the three preparations (unfil-
tered, the flow-through fraction and the retained fraction) were
obtained using a scanning microscope (SEM) (Model S-4700
Field Emission SEM; Hitachi High Technologies, Tokyo, Japan)
at 5–10 kV, and the lengths of MWCNT-N fibers were measured
using a digital map meter (Comcurve-9 Junior; Koizumi Sokki,
Niigata, Japan); at least 500 fibers in three to five SEM photos of
the unfiltered and flow-through fractions were measured. The
length of the unfiltered MWCNT-N fibers was 4.2 � 2.9 µm
and the length of the MWCNT in the flow-through fraction was
2.6 � 1.6 µm. The lengths of the MWCNT-N fibers in the
retained fraction could not be measured because of the formation
of dense agglomerates due to the loss of the PF68 dispersant
solution. The diameter of the MWCNT-N fibers was mostly
(93.4%) within 30–80 nm. The iron content was 0.046% by
weight (Ogata, Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Public Health,
unpublished data).
Animals and treatment. One hundred 10-week-old F344/Crj
male
rats
(Charles
River
Laboratories
Japan,
Yokohama,
Japan) were divided into five groups of 20 animals each:
Group 1, no treatment; Group 2, vehicle; Group 3, unfiltered
MWCNT-N;
Group
4,
MWCNT-N
flow-through
fraction;
Group 5, MWCNT-N retained fraction. The MWCNT suspen-
sions were sonicated for 30 min shortly before use to minimize
aggregation. Each preparation was administered to the rats by
the trans-tracheal intrapulmonary spraying (TIPS) method, an
apposite antecedent to costly aerosol inhalation studies, at a
dose of 125 µg in 0.5 mL vehicle per rat. The animals were
administered MWCNT-N eight times (total 1 mg/rat) over a 2-
week period. Briefly, rats were anaesthetized by inhalation of
5% isoflurane; the mouth was fully opened with the tongue
gently held and the nozzle of a microsprayer (series IA-1B
Intratracheal
Aerosolizer;
Penn-century,
Philadelphia,
PA,
USA) connected to a 1-mL syringe was inserted through the
larynx into the trachea; the 0.5-mL suspension was sprayed
into the lungs synchronizing with spontaneous respiratory
inhalation.(11,16,19–21)
In preliminary studies, we confirmed that the dosed materi-
als, particles and fibers reached most of the terminal alveoli
without causing obvious respiratory distress. The initial num-
ber of animals was 20 rats in each group. At the end of week
2, 5 rats from each group were killed 24 h after the last
administration of MWCNT and used to measure the dosed
amount of MWCNT-N. The remaining 15 rats were observed
until the end of the experiment at week 109. Moribund animals
were killed by exsanguination from the inferior vena cava
under the deep anesthesia induced by 10% isoflurane. Rats that
survived for at least 63 weeks (the first death caused by tumor
development occurred at week 64) were included in the analy-
sis of the experimental data. The major organs, the lung, pleu-
ral wall, peritoneal wall, brain, liver, kidney, spleen and
mediastinal, submandibular and mesentery lymph nodes, were
excised, fixed in ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde and processed
for histological examination. The study was conducted accord-
ing to the Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Ani-
mals of Nagoya City University Medical School (Nagoya,
Japan). Histopathological evaluation was peer reviewed by Dr
Shoji Fukusima, Director, Japan Bioassay Research Center,
and Dr Tomoyuki Shirai, Emeritous Professor, Department of
Experimental Pathology and Tumor Biology, Nagoya City
University Graduate School of Medical Sciences. Dr Tsuda

ogy (Diplomate of JSTP) and the Japan Society of Pathology.
Immunohistochemistry. Briefly, tissue sections were deparaf-
finized with xylene, hydrated through a graded ethanol series
and water, incubated in heat processor solution pH6 (715281;
Nichirei Biosciences, Tokyo, Japan) at 100°C for 40 min., incu-
bated in 3% H2O2 (715242 Nichirei Biosciences, Tokyo, Japan)
for 15 min, blocked with 5% BSA 5% serum in PBS for 1 h at
room temperature, incubated overnight with 1° Ab at 4°C, incu-
bated with 2° Ab (414191, Nichirei Biosciences, Tokyo, Japan)
for 1 h at room temperature, visualized with DAB (425011
Nichirei Biosciences, Tokyo, Japan), and counterstained with
hematoxylin. Primary antibodies used were calretinin (bs-0062R
Bioss Antibodies, Boston MA, USA) diluted 1:100, podoplanin
(11-035; AngioBio, San Diego CA, USA) diluted 1:20, thyroid
transcription factor-1 (sc-13040; Santa Cruz Biotechnology,
Dallas TX, USA) diluted 1:50, and Wilms tumor protein (sc-
192, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) diluted 1:50. Because in rats, as
in humans, ERC/mesothelin is not a good marker to differentiate
epithelial carcinomas from sarcomatous mesotheliomas, staining
with ERC/mesothelin was not performed.
Observation of multiwalled carbon nanotubes in the lung by
polarized light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy.
The MWCNT fibers in H&E stained slides of lung tissue and
chest wall sections were observed with polarized light micro-
scopy (BX51N-31P-O; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) at 4009 mag-
nification. The exact localization of the illuminated fibers was
confirmed in the same H&E-stained sections after removing
the polarizing filter. For SEM, H&E stained slides were
immersed in xylene for 2–3 days to remove the cover glass,

 immersed in 100% ethanol for 10 min to remove the xylene,
and air-dried for 2 h at room temperature. The slides were
then coated with platinum for viewing the MWCNT fibers by
SEM (Model S-4700 Field Emission Scanning Electronic
Microscope, Hitachi High Technologies) at 5–10 kV.
Measurement of multiwalled carbon nanotubes in the lung.
This procedure is based on a previously published report.(22)
Sample preparation. Paraformaldehyde fixed lung samples
were allowed to react with Clean 99-K200R (C99) (Clean
Chemical, Osaka, Japan) at room temperature overnight. The
solution was then centrifuged at 13 000 9 g for 10 min and
the supernatant was removed. The precipitate was resuspended
in 1 mL of 9.6% PBS containing 0.1% Tween 80 (TW-solu-
tion) followed by a second centrifugation at 13 000 9 g for
10 min. The pellet was resuspended in 100-lL concentrated
sulfuric acid to remove the organic content. 1-mL TW-solution
was stirred into the acid-MWCNT-N mixture. 25 lL of a solu-
tion of 0.125 lg/mL Benzo[ghi]perylene (B[ghi]P) in acetoni-
trile was then added, and the B[ghi]P was allowed to adsorb
onto the MWCNT for 15 min. The mixture was passed
through a Nuclepore membrane filter (Whatman 111109, pore
size 0.8 lm, diameter 47 mm; Fisher Scientific, Waltham MA,
USA), and the MWCNT containing region was punched out
and placed in 1-mL acetonitrile and sonicated for 10 s with an
ultrasonic homogenizer (VP-30S, 20 kHz, 300 W; TAITEC,
Tokyo, Japan). The solution was then filtered for HPLC analy-
sis of the extracted B[ghi]P.
Generation of a calibration curve. A 10-mg sample of
MWCNT-N was added to 40 mL of the TW-mixture and soni-
cated for 30 min. The solution was diluted to 2 lg/mL with
C99. This solution was used to prepare additional standards of
0.4, 0.8, 1.2 and 1.6 lg/mL MWCNT-N in C99. Then 0.1 mL
of each of the standards was centrifuged (13 000 9 g, 10 min)
and the pellets resuspended in concentrated sulfuric acid and
treated as described above.
Statistical analyses. Tumor incidence was analyzed using
Fisher’s exact test, with significance set at P ≤ 0.05.
Results
Effect of sieve fractionation on the size of multiwalled carbon
nanotubes. The MWCNT-N from NIKKISO (original reported
size of 3.5 µm in length and 1–20 nm in diameter) was sus-
pended in 20-mL saline containing 0.5% Pluronic F68 (PF68)
to a final concentration of 250 µg/mL for administration to
rats. A portion of the MWCNT-N was fractionated by passing
it through a sieve with a pore size of 25 µm to obtain fractions
with different length MWCNT. The length of the unfiltered
fibers and the fibers in the flow-through fraction in the admin-
istration dispersant showed a normal distribution in the range
of <1–10 µm. The mean lengths of the unfiltered MWCNT-N
and MWCNT-N in the flow-through fraction were 4.2 � 2.9
and 2.6 � 1.6 µm, respectively. The size of the retained
MWCNT-N could not be measured because of the dense
agglomerates the retained fibers formed due to loss of the
PF68 dispersant during fractionation. SEM images of the three
fractions are shown in Figure 1. For the rats administered
unfiltered MWCNT-N, the size of the fibers in the lung tissue
slides tended to be smaller than in the administered preparation
(Table 1).

MWCNT-N retained groups. MWCNT was administered to the
lung by the TIPS method eight times over a 2-week period;
24 h after the last treatment, 5 rats from each group were
killed and the amount of MWCNT in their lungs was deter-
mined (Table 2). At the end of the experiment, week 109, the
MWCNT remaining in the lungs of rats administered unfiltered
MWCNT-N and the flow-through and retained MWCNT frac-
tions were 25.4, 48.0 and 26.3%, respectively, of the amount
measured at week 2 (Table 2).
Localization of multiwalled carbon nanotubes. Figure 2 shows
MWCNT-N in the lung and lymph node. MWCNT-N was
mostly found in the lung alveoli and had a needle-like or gran-
ular appearance. MWCNT-N fibers were also present in the
mediastinal space, as evidenced by their presence in mediasti-
nal lymphnodes and periaortic connective tissue. In the alveoli,

MWCNT induces mesothelioma

 MWCNT was found in macrophages (Fig. 2a) and in granula-
tion tissue (Fig. 2b). Abundant MWCNT-N was also found in
bronchial and mediastinal lymph nodes (Fig. 2c), and periaor-
tic connective tissue (Fig. 2d). Needle-shaped MWCNT aggre-
gates detected by polarized light microscopy can be seen in
Figure 2(a and b). Damage of the submucosal tissue of the tra-
cheal wall through accumulation of large agglomerates of
MWCNT (Fig. 2c) and fibrotic thickening of periaortic con-
nective tissue (Fig. 2d) were also noted; thickening of pleural
tissue was not observed in untreated or vehicle control ani-
mals.
Results of the 109-week study. All moribund animals were
killed by exsanguination from the inferior vena cava under
deep anesthesia and autopsied. Prior to the first death due to
cancer-related causes, six animals died. These animals were
excluded from the study. At week 64 an animal died from
lung tumors. Therefore, all animals surviving for 63 weeks or
more were included in the study. Figure 3 shows a Kaplan–
Meier survival plot. There are no differences in survival times
between any of the groups and the vehicle control group.
Mesothelioma-bearing animals tended to die before week
109: in the unfiltered group, 1 mesothelioma-bearing rat died
during week 96, a second during week 101, and a third during
week 108; in the flow-through group, 1 mesothelioma-bearing
rat died during week 79 and a second during week 99. The
third mesothelioma-bearing rat in the flow-through group sur-
vived until the end of the experiment (week 109); this rat also
had a lung adenocarcinoma.
In contrast to the mesothelioma-bearing rats, seven rats bear-
ing lung tumors died before week 109 and six rats bearing
lung tumors survived until the end of the experiment: in the
unfiltered group, 1 rat bearing a lung adenoma died during
week 74 and 1 bearing a lung adenocarcinoma during week
108. The 2 other lung adenocarcinoma-bearing bearing rats in

 this group survived until the end of the experiment. In the
flow-through group, 1 rat bearing a lung adenoma died during
week 82 and 1 bearing a lung adenocarcinoma died during
week 103. The second rat bearing a lung adenocarcinoma sur-
vived until the end of the experiment; this rat also had a
mesothelioma. In the retained group, 1 rat bearing a lung ade-
noma died during week 74 and a second during week 76, and
1 rat bearing a lung adenocarcinoma died during week 64 and
a second during week 87. The 3 other lung adenocarcinoma-
bearing rats in this group survived until the end of the experi-
ment.
The incidence of malignant mesothelioma in the three
MWCNT groups combined, 6/38 (15.8%), was significantly
higher compared to the two control groups combined, 0/28
(0%; P = 0.034) (Table 3). While no statistically significant
differences in the incidence of malignant mesotheliomas were
found among the three groups administered the different
MWCNT fractions, it is noteworthy that the groups adminis-
tered the unfiltered and flow-through fractions had incidences
of 3 mesothelioma cases each and the group administered the
retained fraction did not have any cases of mesothelioma.

 Mesotheliomas were irregularly shaped whitish masses with
diameters of up to 1.5 cm. All the malignant mesotheliomas
were localized in the mediastinal space (Cavum mediastinale),
showing adhesion to the lung and heart or invasion of the lung
parenchyma, peri-cardium and myo-cardium (Fig. 4). The pri-
mary site of these mesotheliomas could not be determined
because all the tumor masses were at an advanced stage. None
of the mesotheliomas were located in the lateral parietal
pleura. One case of mesothelioma in the unfiltered group (“U”
in Table 3) showed invasion of the mesothelioma into the
lung. Interestingly, this tumor also showed invasion into the
lung adenocarcinoma present in this animal. The mesothe-
liomas originated from mesothelial tissue outside of the lung
and, consequently, were negative for thyroid transcription fac-
tor-1 (TFF-1) (Fig. 5). Figure 6 shows that TFF-1 clearly
stains normal bronchiolar epithelium.
Figure 7 is a macroscopic view of a lung adenocarcinoma.
Lung tumors, both adenomas and adenocarcinomas, were posi-
tive for TFF-1 (Figures 8–11). The incidence of lung tumors
(bronchiolo-alveolar adenoma and carcinoma) (14/38; 36.8%)
was significantly higher than the control group (0/28; 0%)
(P < 0.001) (Table 3). No obvious site prevalence was noted
in the lung tumors. No significant difference in the incidence
of lung tumors or total tumor burden was found among the
three groups administered the different MWCNT-N sieve frac-
tions.
The Incidences of tumors in other organs did not show any
statistical difference from the controls (Table 4). Two cases of

 well-differentiated mesothelioma in the peritoneal cavity show-
ing continuation to the tunica vaginalis were found in the vehi-
cle control group and one each in the flow-through and
retained MWCNT fraction administered groups. These peri-
toneal mesothiolomas were excluded from the statistical analy-
sis of pleural mesotheliomas because of probable scrotal tissue
origin.(23)
Discussion
Based on the fibrous structure and physical properties of
MWCNT, there is concern that without proper controls, use
of this material could lead to an asbestos-like pandemic of
disease.(3) Initial studies showed that after administration of
MWCNT by inhalation and tracheal instillation, MWCNT
reached the pleura and caused toxicity to both the lung and
pleura.(9,10,13–15,17,24–27) In addition, other studies showed that
administration of MWCNT-7 by intraperitoneal or intrascrotal
injection caused mesotheliomas in male p53+/� mice and
rats.(4–7) Thus, like asbestos, MWCNT is able to induce can-
cer of the mesothelium and, when administered to the lung,
is toxic to both the lung and pleura. While these studies did
not directly show that MWCNT administered via the airway,
the exposure route most relevant to humans, was carcino-
genic,
they
did
demonstrate
the
possibility
that
inhaled
MWCNT may be carcinogenic. A recent study, however, did
demonstrate that inhalation of MWCNT-7 promoted lung
tumors
initiated
by
methylcholanthrene
in
mice,
directly
demonstrating
the
carcinogenic
potential
of
inhaled
MWCNT.(28) Based on the above findings, MWCNT-7 was
evaluated as a Group 2B carcinogen, sufficient evidence of
carcinogenicity
in
animals
and
possibly
carcinogenic
to
humans, by WHO/International Agency for Research on Can-
cer (WHO/IARC).
The primary objective of the present study was to determine
whether administration of MWCNT-N via the airway to the rat
lung using the TIPS method, an apposite antecedent to costly
aerosol inhalation studies, was carcinogenic to the lung or
pleural tissues. Our earlier studies were the first reports that
MWCNT administered to the lung induced inflammation and
hyperplastic proliferative lesions of the mesothelium.(11,16) The
work reported in the present study is the first report to demon-
strate that inhaled MWCNT is carcinogenic to the pleura,
clearly indicating that MWCNT administered to the lung has
the potential to induce malignant mesothelioma. In addition,
the present study demonstrates that instillation of MWCNT
into the lung induces lung tumors. Thus, exposure of rats to
MWCNT via the airway results in malignant mesothelioma
and
lung
tumors,
extending
the
IARC
classification
of
MWCNT-7 as a group 2B carcinogen to other species of
MWCNT; Table 5 compares MWCNT-7 and MWCNT-N.(4,5)
The incidences of tumors in other organs did not show any
statistical difference from the controls (Table 4), including the
peritoneal cavity mesotheliomas in the vehicle control group
(2 mesotheliomas), the flow-through group (1 mesothelioma)
and the retained MWCNT fraction group (1 mesothelioma).
These peritoneal mesothiolomas were excluded from the statis-
tical analysis of pleural mesotheliomas because aged male

 Fischer 344/N rats are prone to developing spontaneous peri-
toneal mesotheliomas that arise predominantly from the tunica
vaginalis of the testes.(23)
In
the
present
study,
rats
were
exposed
to
1 mg
of
MWCNT-N per animal. Because the alveolar surface area of
the rat lung (both lungs) is 0.4 m2,(29) this dose is approxi-
mately 2.5 mg/m2 alveolar surface area. This is approximately
fourfold higher than that used in the MWCNT-7 inhalation
study by Sargent et al.(28) Mice were exposed to 5 mg/m3
MWCNT-7 for 5 h/day for 15 days using a whole body inhala-
tion system resulting in a lung burden of 31.2 µg MWCNT/
mouse. Because the alveolar surface area of the mouse is
approximately 0.05 m2, the mice were exposed to 624 µg
MWCNT per m2 alveolar surface area. For a human exposed
to MWCNT in the workplace, assuming a minute ventilation
of 20 L/min for a person doing light work,(30) 8 h exposure
per day, and a workload of 48 weeks for 45 years, a worker
exposed to 1 µg/m3 would inhale approximately 104 mg
MWCNT over their working life. Because the human lung is
approximately 102 m2 and assuming a 30% deposition frac-
tion,(31,32) this would result in deposition of approximately
0.3 mg/m2 in the lung. Importantly, however, human exposure
can be much higher. For example, in two epidemiological
studies, one study determined that workers were exposed to
levels of MWCNT up to 6.11 µg/m3 and the other study deter-
mined that workers were exposed to levels of CNT up to
42.6 µg/m3.(33) In addition, recommended exposure levels for
different CNT vary widely between countries, from 1 to
50 µg/m3.(34) Thus, administration of 1 mg MWCNT/rat is a
reasonable dose for initial investigations into the carcinogenic-
ity of an inhaled MWCNT.
While not the main theme of the present study, our collec-
tive results suggest that TIPS can be used to identify agents
that are potentially carcinogenic to the lung and pleural
mesothelium. Previously, we reported that male rats were each
administered a total of 1.25 mg MWCNT (MWCNT-M or
MWCNT-N) over a 9-day period using TIPS. The rats were
killed 6 h after the final administration. Hyperplastic visceral
mesothelial
proliferation
was
clearly
observed
in
the
MWCNT-treated groups.(11) These results coupled with the
results of the present study suggest the possibility that prolifer-
ative lesions seen shortly after administration of MWCNT in
the previous study could transform into preneoplastic lesions
and, ultimately, into the neoplastic lesions observed in the pre-
sent study. Thus, TIPS, which can be used by numerous
research groups, can be employed as a preliminary screening
method for hazard identification of respirable materials. Given
the increasing production and wide use of nanomaterials, it is
a practical impossibility to evaluate their risk using standard
whole body inhalation testing, especially considering the low
number of research groups that have access to such testing sys-
tems. Therefore, it is essential that less expensive, widely
available
screening
methods
for
hazard
identification
of
nanoparticles (and other respirable materials) are developed to
lessen the number of materials that need to be assessed by 2-
year whole body inhalation assays to manageable levels.

 through the visceral pleura in mice has been reported.(9,12,17)
In contrast, accumulation of MWCNT in the mediastinal lym-
phnodes points to the possible involvement of lymphatic ves-
sels in their translocation.(11,14,16,35,36) We demonstrated the
presence of MWCNT in pleural lavage fluid collected shortly
after its administration to the lung,(11,16) supporting the pre-
mise that MWCNT may be transported through the lymphatic
systems. Clearly, future studies designed to elucidate the
translocation route of MWCNT to the pleura are warranted.
To investigate size dependency of MWCNT on the induction
of lung and mesothelial lesions, MWCNT-N was sieved to
produce three preparations with different average lengths:
unfiltered MWCNT-N (4.2 � 2.9 µm), MWCNT-N in the
flow-through
fraction
(2.6 � 1.6 µm),
and
the
MWCNT
retained by the sieve (not measurable due to the dense agglom-
erates the retained fibers formed due to the loss of the PF68
dispersant during filtration) (Table 1). Interestingly, in the rats
administered unfiltered MWCNT-N, the size of the fibers in
the lung tissue slides tended to be smaller than in the adminis-
tered preparation (Table 1). The reason for the difference in
the average
size of
the administered
MWCNT
and the
MWCNT found in the lung is unknown; however, one possi-
bility is that the longer MWCNT did not penetrate to the alve-
oli as efficiently as shorter MWCNT.
We did not observe any statistically significant differences
in the incidence of mesothelial or bronchiolo-alveolar tumors

 induced by the different MWCNT-N preparations. However, it
is noteworthy that both the unfiltered and flow-through frac-
tions induced mesothelioma while the retained fraction did not.
In addition, the incidence of lung tumors was higher (not sta-
tistically significant) in the rats administered the retained frac-
tion of MWCNT. Although the reasons for these observations
are not clear, it is possibly due to the formation of aggregates
and agglomerates that impeded the movement/clearance of the
MWCNT in the retained fraction.
Persistence of fibers in the lung and pleura is thought to be
a key element in the toxic effects that fibers can have on these
tissues.(3,37,38) In our study, the amount of MWCNT in the
lung at week 109 was 25.4% (unfiltered MWCNT-N), 48.0%
(flow-through fraction) and 26.3% (retained fraction) of the
amount of MWCNT in the lung 24 h after the last administra-
tion of MWCNT at week 2. This is comparable to the amount
of MWCNT retained in the mouse lung 48 weeks after expo-
sure to MWCNT.(25) In that study, the total lung burden of
MWCNT
1
and
336 days
after
inhalation
exposure
to
MWCNT was 28.1 � 0.8 µg and 18.3 � 1.1 µg, respectively;
assuming linear clearance of MWCNT from the lung, the lung
burden at 109 weeks would be approximately 6 µg or 21% of
the burden at day 1 post-exposure. Therefore, induction of
malignant mesothelioma and lung alveolar cell tumors in the
present study was unlikely to be due to abnormal clearance of
MWCNT from the lung.
Tumors developed in the areas of MWCNT deposition, the
lung and mediastinal space. The main deposition site in the
lung tissue at the time of death was in alveolar macrophages
and small alveolar–granulomatous lesions. Deposition was also
observed in the mediastinal and bronchial lymphnodes and the
periphery of the tumor tissues, both lung tumors and malignant
mesotheliomas. As noted above, our previous studies showed
that administration of MWCNT to the lung caused an inflam-
matory response, and this response could be relevant to
MWCNT-induced cancer development.(39–42) In addition, gen-
eration of cytotoxic oxygen radicals and cytokines by activated
macrophages might be involved in the generation and growth
of tumor cells.(11,16,43–45) Observations in our previous study
that mesothelial cell proliferation is enhanced by conditioned
macrophage culture media and by the supernatants of pleural
cavity lavage are consistent with this premise.(11)
Iron impurities in MWCNT may possibly play a role in
MWCNT toxicity.(46) However, iron containing MWCNT does
not appear to generate radicals in vivo.(47) In the present study,
MWCNT with an iron content of only 0.046% by weight,
approximately10-fold lower than the iron content of the
MWCNT used by Aldieri et al. (0.420%)(46) or Fenoglio et al.
(0.47%),(47) was carcinogenic to both the lung and pleura, sug-
gesting that the iron content of MWCNT may not be of pri-
mary importance in MWCNT-mediated carcinogenicity. In
contrast, an alternative hypothesis for a role of iron in
MWCNT-induced cell injury and carcinogenesis has been pro-
posed by Wang et al.(48) These authors report that hemoglobin
and transferrin can adsorb onto the surface of MWCNT, and
that the MWCNT–hemoglobin–transferrin complex can bind to
transferrin receptor 1 and be endocytosed into rat peritoneal
mesothelial cells in vitro. This resulted in iron overload in the
cell and subsequent DNA damage. Thus, even iron-free
MWCNT could transport excess iron into a cell, resulting in
iron-mediated DNA damage. The role of iron in mesothelioma
induction in vivo clearly warrants further investigation.
In conclusion, exposure of rats to 1 mg MWCNT-N per rat
via the airway, the exposure route that is relevant to humans,
results in malignant mesothelioma and lung alveolar cell
tumors. This is the first report to document the induction of
lung and mesothelial tumors in rats administered MWCNT via
the airway and extends the IARC classification of MWCNT-7
as a group 2B carcinogen to other species of MWCNT.
