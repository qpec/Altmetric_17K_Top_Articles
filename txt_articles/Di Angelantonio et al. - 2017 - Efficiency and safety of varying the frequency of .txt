Summary
Background Limits on the frequency of whole blood donation exist primarily to safeguard donor health. However, 
there is substantial variation across blood services in the maximum frequency of donations allowed. We compared 
standard practice in the UK with shorter inter-donation intervals used in other countries.
Methods In this parallel group, pragmatic, randomised trial, we recruited whole blood donors aged 18 years or older 
from 25 centres across England, UK. By use of a computer-based algorithm, men were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to 
12-week (standard) versus 10-week versus 8-week inter-donation intervals, and women were randomly assigned (1:1:1) 
to 16-week (standard) versus 14-week versus 12-week intervals. Participants were not masked to their allocated 
intervention group. The primary outcome was the number of donations over 2 years. Secondary outcomes related to 
safety were quality of life, symptoms potentially related to donation, physical activity, cognitive function, haemoglobin 
and ferritin concentrations, and deferrals because of low haemoglobin. This trial is registered with ISRCTN, number 
ISRCTN24760606, and is ongoing but no longer recruiting participants. 
Findings 45 263 whole blood donors (22 466 men, 22 797 women) were recruited between June 11, 2012, and June 15, 2014. 
Data were analysed for 45 042 (99·5%) participants. Men were randomly assigned to the 12-week (n=7452) versus 
10-week (n=7449) versus 8-week (n=7456) groups; and women to the 16-week (n=7550) versus 14-week (n=7567) versus 
12-week (n=7568) groups. In men, compared with the 12-week group, the mean amount of blood collected per donor 
over 2 years increased by 1·69 units (95% CI 1·59–1·80; approximately 795 mL) in the 8-week group and by 0·79 units 
(0·69–0·88; approximately 370 mL) in the 10-week group (p<0·0001 for both). In women, compared with the 16-week 
group, it increased by 0·84 units (95% CI 0·76–0·91; approximately 395 mL) in the 12-week group and by 0·46 units 
(0·39–0·53; approximately 215 mL) in the 14-week group (p<0·0001 for both). No significant differences were observed 
in quality of life, physical activity, or cognitive function across randomised groups. However, more frequent donation 
resulted in more donation-related symptoms (eg, tiredness, breathlessness, feeling faint, dizziness, and restless legs, 
especially among men [for all listed symptoms]), lower mean haemoglobin and ferritin concentrations, and more 
deferrals for low haemoglobin (p<0·0001 for each) than those observed in the standard frequency groups.
Interpretation Over 2 years, more frequent donation than is standard practice in the UK collected substantially more 
blood without having a major effect on donors’ quality of life, physical activity, or cognitive function, but resulted in 
more donation-related symptoms, deferrals, and iron deficiency.

Introduction
Worldwide, tens of millions of whole blood donors 
provide around 110 million donations annually, enabling 
life-saving transfusions for many clinical indications.1 
Yet, despite more than a century of blood donation, the 
efficiency and safety of different approaches to blood 
collection have not been properly evaluated. In particular, 
no randomised trial has yet investigated the effect of 
different inter-donation intervals on blood supply and 
donor health. The absence of evidence has resulted in 
widely varying policies and practices across international 
blood services, producing uncertain and, potentially, 
non-optimal outcomes for blood donors. For example, in 
the UK, the current practice is to allow men to donate 
every 12 weeks and women every 16 weeks.2 By contrast, 
in the USA, men and women can donate every 8 weeks. 
In France and Germany, men can donate every 8 weeks 
and women every 12 weeks.3,4
In recent years, demand for blood has generally de-
clined in western countries, probably because of adop-
tion of lower haemoglobin triggers for transfusion and 
other approaches to avoid transfusion.5,6 However, there 
is grow 
ing demand for universal blood groups (eg, O 
Rhesus D [RhD] negative and A RhD negative) and for 
minor blood groups that might be needed to support 
multiply trans 
fused populations (eg, patients with sickle 
cell disease).5 In the longer term, the decline in demand 
could slow (or even reverse) as a result of population

ageing. In parallel, maintenance of the blood supply 
could become more difficult than at present as blood 
services encounter problems in attracting and retaining 
young donors.7
One approach to managing the blood supply is to collect 
blood more frequently from existing donors.8 However, 
limits on the frequency of donation exist to safeguard 
donor health and the quality of blood components. 
In observational studies, shorter than average inter-
donation intervals have been associated with higher 
frequency of iron deficiency, lower haemoglobin, and 
higher rates of deferral (temporary suspension of donors 
from giving blood) because of failure of donors to meet 
minimum haemoglobin concentrations.9–11 However, such 
studies have been liable to biases and have generally failed 
to collect information systematically on relevant outcomes.
We report the results of the INTERVAL trial, which 
aimed to assess the effect of different inter-donation 
intervals on blood supply and donor health over a 
2-year period.
Methods
Trial design and participants
INTERVAL was a large, parallel group, pragmatic, 
randomised trial. Full details of the trial’s objectives, 
design, and recruitment have been published.12,13 Eligible 
donors were aged 18 years or older, fulfilled 
routine criteria for donation, had an email address 
and access to the internet to respond to web-based 
questionnaires, and were willing to be randomly 
assigned to any of the trial’s intervention groups at one 
of the 25 static donor centres of NHS Blood and 
Transplant (NHSBT), the sole blood provider to the 
National Health Service (NHS) in England, UK. Donors 
underwent routine screening for eligibility, including 
haemoglobin screening via a gravimetric method 
(copper sulphate test), followed by the spectrophotometric 
HemoCue test (HemoCue AB, Ängelholm, Sweden) 
with venous blood for those who failed the copper 
sulphate test (minimum thresholds to donate in England 
are 135 g/L for men and 125 g/L for women).14 If, for any 
reason, the donor was not eligible to make a donation on 
that day, they could not join the trial on that occasion. 
After reading study leaflets and participating in a 
discussion with donor carer staff, eligible donors were 
asked to complete the trial consent form before giving a 
blood donation. The National Research Ethics Service 
approved (11/EE/0538) this study.
Randomisation and blinding
Men were randomly assigned to 12-week (standard) versus 
10-week versus 8-week inter-donation intervals, and women 
to 16-week (standard) versus 14-week versus 12-week 
intervals, without any other limit on the maximum number 
of donations allowed during the study period. Balanced 
randomisation of donors to sex-specific intervention 
groups in the ratio of 1:1:1 was done at the coordinating 
centre by use of a computer program built into the 
trial database, with a minimisation algorithm to ensure 
key characteristics (age, weight, and numbers of new vs 
existing donors) were balanced across trial groups at 
baseline. Randomisation was stratified by donation centre. 
Because of the nature of the intervention, it was not 
possible 
to 
blind 
participants 
to 
their 
allocated 
intervention group.
Procedures
Donors were recruited between June 11, 2012, and 
June 15, 2014.13 Immediately after enrolment, participants 
received online questionnaires, including the 36-item 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
We searched for randomised trials published in English before 
March 1, 2017, investigating the effect of varying the whole 
blood inter-donation interval. We searched PubMed, Scientific 
Citation Index Expanded, and Embase using relevant terms: 
“blood donation intervals”, ”blood donation frequency”, “blood 
supply”, and “donor health”. Although blood donation has been 
practised for more than 100 years, we could not identify any 
randomised trials on this topic.
Added value of this study
As the first-ever such randomised trial, this study should 
provide uniquely reliable insight into the consequences of 
reducing the inter-donation interval. Furthermore, because the 
trial was embedded in a national blood service, it had major 
additional advantages. First, it recorded a comprehensive range 
of outcomes related to donation efficiency, safety, and 
biochemistry. Second, it achieved a clear separation across 
randomised groups because of good adherence to the trial 
interventions. Third, it achieved rapid recruitment across the 
geographical breadth of England, UK, and included participants 
broadly representative of the national donor population. 
Fourth, it randomised more than 45 000 participants, providing 
excellent statistical power. Fifth, it achieved 99·5% 
completeness in the primary outcome.
Implications of all the available evidence
Our data give policy makers in the UK the short-term option of 
allowing more frequent collection from donors than is now 
standard, such as for in-demand blood groups or during periods 
of falling supply. Our data also quantify the extent of iron 
depletion within 2 years of repeated donation, thus informing 
safety guidelines. Finally, our results suggest a need to use 
comprehensive reminders to help donors make and keep 
appointments, and to review the screening method used in 
the UK to test individuals’ eligibility to donate.

Short Form Health Survey, version 2 (SF-36v2).15 Only 
participants who completed baseline questionnaires were 
eligible for randomisation. Participants were advised of 
their allocated inter-donation interval by email, which was 
recorded in the NHSBT donor database. A non-fasting 
research blood sample was taken before donation at the 
enrolment visit and at the 2-year survey (but not at the 
intervening donations) and transported to a central 
laboratory for a full blood count analysis (Sysmex XN-2000 
haematology analyser, UK BioCentre, Stockport, UK). 
Aliquots of EDTA (edetic acid) plasma, serum, and buffy 
coat were stored at –80°C. DNA was extracted from 
buffy coat by use of a Kleargene method (LGC Genomics, 
Teddington, UK). Technicians unaware of the intervention 
groups to which participants had been allocated did 
laboratory assays. Samples of sufficient concentration 
and purity were aliquoted for shipment to Affymetrix 
(Santa Clara, CA, USA), where genotyping was done for 
haemochromatosis gene (HFE) mutation carrier status 
as part of a high-density genotyping array (Biobank 
Axiom Array, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Ferritin concen-
trations were measured at baseline and at the 2-year 
survey (with the 2-year survey only done in a randomly 
selected subset) in stored serum samples with an 
immunoturbidimetric assay (Roche/Hitachi chemistry 
analyser, Stichting Huisartsen Laboratorium, Etten-Leur, 
Netherlands). We regarded ferritin results as post-hoc 
findings, since they were not included in the prespecified 
analysis plan.
The INTERVAL trial used a more comprehensive 
approach to remind participants to make and keep 
donation appointments than that used routinely by 
NHSBT, including a uniform protocol of email, text 
message, and telephone reminders (appendix). At 6, 12, 
and 18 months of follow-up, donor safety characteristics 
were monitored by participants’ online responses to the 
abbreviated 12-item Short Form Health Survey, version 2 
(SF-12v2).16 At these timepoints, donors were asked about 
the presence of symptoms potentially related to blood 
donation that had occurred in the previous 6 months. 
At 2 years after randomisation, participants received an 
extended version of the same questionnaire asking about 
symptoms potentially related to blood donation, again 
focusing on the previous 6 months (apart from pica 
[a craving to eat non-food items], for which the relevant 
time period of queries related to the previous 2 years; 
appendix). At the 2-year survey, participants also received 
the SF-36v2, cognitive function tests (attention and 
reaction time, executive function, episodic memory, and 
intelligence),17 and a physical activity questionnaire 
(the Recent Physical Activity Questionnaire).18 The 
deferral policy used in the trial was the same as that used 
in routine NHSBT practice (appendix). For example, 
male donors with measured haemoglobin concentrations 
of 125–134 g/L and female donors with concentrations of 
115–124 g/L were deferred for a period of 3 months. At a 
participant’s last donation before completing the 2-year 
involvement in the trial, blood research sampling was 
repeated as described above. If participants were deferred 
or medically withdrawn from blood donation at that 
time, they gave a research sample only.
Outcomes
The primary outcome was the number of blood donations 
over 2 years, with standard practice being to donate 1 unit 
of blood per session (full donation unit 470 mL). 
Secondary outcomes related to safety were quality of life, 
donation-related symptoms, physical activity, cognitive 
function, haemoglobin and ferritin concentrations, and 
deferrals because of low haemoglobin. Physical wellbeing 
at 2 years, assessed with the physical component score of 
SF-36v2, was prespecified as the key secondary outcome. 
We compared both the primary outcome and the key 
secondary outcome between each of the higher frequency 
groups versus the standard frequency group (for men: 
8 vs 12 weeks and 10 vs 12 weeks; for women: 12 vs 
16 weeks and 14 vs 16 weeks). For other outcomes and 
prespecified tests for interaction, linear trend was 
assessed across randomised groups. Certain secondary 
outcomes related to safety (eg, self-reported symptoms) 
involved a combination of data from multiple donation 
sessions attended, or multiple questionnaires answered, 
by each participant.
Statistical analysis
The statistical analysis followed a prespecified plan 
(appendix). Briefly, data for men and women were 
analysed separately by the intention-to-treat principle 
according to their randomised groups.
Ferritin values were loge transformed and presented 
as geometric means, and used to classify donors as iron 
depleted (<15 µg/L) according to WHO criteria.19 For all 
other outcomes, we present means and percentages 
without adjustment. We compared randomised groups 
by calculating p values for differences or linear trend 
using normal regression models for continuous 
outcomes and logistic regression models for binary 
outcomes adjusted for centre, age, weight, new donor 
status, and baseline value of the outcome (when 
relevant). Because of the number of statistical tests 
done, we used the following guidelines for considering 
whether the results provided strong evidence: p less 
than 0·005 for the main analysis of the number of 
donations over 2 years and physical component score at 
2 years; p less than 0·0005 for their interaction tests; 
and p less than 0·0002 for the tests of trend for the 
other secondary outcomes.
The sample size calculation was based on having 
80% power to detect a difference of 5% or more in 
donation rates (the primary outcome) in subgroups with 
a prevalence of 10% or more. This calculation assumed 
a type I error of 0·05 and mean donation rate of 
1·6 times per year in the standard donation frequency 
group, and between-subject SD of 0·7 times per year in

each group. Furthermore, the sample size was estimated 
to provide 80% power to detect a mean difference of 3% 
or more in the physical component score of the SF-36v2 
(the key secondary outcome) in subgroups with a 
prevalence of 10% or more. This calculation assumed a 
type I error of 0·05 and mean physical component score 
of 50 in the standard donation frequency group, and 
between-subject SD of 10 in each group. Analyses were 
done with Stata, version 13.

ISRCTN24760606. 
Role of the funding source
The academic investigators and representatives of 
NHSBT, a funder of the trial, participated in the study 
design and oversight. The investigators at the trial’s 
academic coordinating centre had sole access to the 
trial database, and had final responsibility for data 
collection, data integrity, data analysis, and data 
interpretation, as well as manuscript drafting and the

found 
to 
have 
venous 
concentrations less than 135 g/L and 3037 (13·7%) of 
22 171 women were found to have venous concentrations 
less than 125 g/L with a haematology analyser. 
Geometric mean baseline ferritin values, which were 
available for 42 155 (94%) participants, were 44·9 µg/L 
(IQR 27·0–77·0) in men and 24·6 µg/L (15·0–44·0) in 
women. 1812 (8·6%) of 21 011 men and 5260 (24·9%) of 
21 144 women had ferritin concentrations less than 
15 µg/L. 1798 (8·0%) of 22 357 men and 2411 (10·6%) of 
22 685 women were classified as new donors. The mean 
number of whole blood donations in the 2 years 
preceding the trial was 3·58 for men and 2·87 for 
women, with a deferral rate for low haemoglobin per 
session attended of 1·1% for men and 3·6% for women 
(table 1). As published previously, participants were 
broadly representative of the national donor population 
of England, with only minor differences in age, sex, and 
number of previous donations (appendix).13
Median times between attending for donation were 
12·3 weeks (IQR 12·0–15·4) for men allocated to the 
12-week group, 10·1 weeks (10·0–13·0) for the 10-week

within 2 weeks of the interval allocated. For women, 
more than 70% of attendances were achieved within 
3 weeks of the interval allocated.
Information on the primary outcome was available for 
45 042 (99·5%) participants. In men, compared with the 
standard 12-week group, the mean amount of blood 
collected per donor increased by 1·69 units (95% CI 
1·59–1·80; approximately 795 mL) in the 8-week group 
and by 0·79 units (0·69–0·88; approximately 370 mL) in 
the 10-week group (p<0·0001 for both; table 2; figure 2). 
In women, compared with the standard 16-week group, 
the mean amount of blood collected per donor increased 
by 0·84 units (95% CI 0·76–0·91; approximately 395 mL) 
in the 12-week group and 0·46 units (0·39–0·53; 
approximately 215 mL) in the 14-week group (p<0·0001 
for both; table 2; figure 2). Among donors with at least a 
2-year history of blood donation before trial enrolment, 
the mean number of donations during the trial was 
38% higher (5·40 vs 3·91 units; appendix) than in the 
preceding 2 years for men allocated to the 12-week group, 
and 15% higher (3·63 vs 3·17 units; appendix) for women 
allocated to the 16-week group.
The mean physical component score at 2 years (for 
which data were available for 29 004 [64·3%] of 
45 042 participants; appendix) did not differ across 
randomised groups (table 2; appendix). Similarly, there 
were no differences in a mixed model analysis 
incorporating physical component score data from all 
6-monthly questionnaires, which involved data from 
38 683 (85·9%) of 45 042 participants (all p>0·005). There 
were no major differences across randomised groups in

the availability of physical component score data for 
6-monthly or 2-year questionnaires.
The availability of data for additional self-reported 
outcomes did not differ across randomised groups 
(appendix). There was no evidence of trends across 
randomised groups in the mental component score of 
the SF-36v2, cognitive function, or physical activity 
(table 3; appendix). Similarly, in the groups randomly 
assigned to higher donation frequencies than the 
standard groups, there was no excess of major adverse 
events (eg, heart failure, myocardial infarction, stroke, 
falls, or transport accidents) or pica. Increasing the 
frequency of donation did not result in increases in 
fainting events at donation sessions (table 3). However, 
the prevalence of self-reported symptoms during the trial 
period (eg, feeling faint, tiredness, breathlessness, 
dizziness, and restless legs, especially among men [for 
all symptoms]) was moderately greater in groups 
randomly assigned to higher donation frequencies than 
in the standard frequency groups (all p<0·0001 for men; 
figure 3 and appendix). Nevertheless, there was no clear 
evidence of differences across randomised groups in 
post-hoc analyses investigating more severe self-reported 
symptoms at 2 years, such as severe shortness of 
breath (assessed by the MRC Breathlessness Scale20) or 
diagnosed restless legs syndrome (Cambridge-Hopkins 
questionnaire;21 appendix).
The availability of haemoglobin data (recorded for 
30 645 [68·0%] of 45 042 participants) was similar across 
randomised groups. Mean haemoglobin concentrations 
at 2 years were lower, and the proportion of participants 
with haemoglobin concentrations below the minimum 
regulatory threshold was higher, in donors allocated to 
shorter intervals than in those allocated to the standard 
donation intervals (p<0·0001; table 3 and appendix). The 
rate of deferral for low haemoglobin per session attended 
(table 3; appendix) increased in men from 2·56% in the 
12-week group to 5·72% in the 8-week group (p<0·0001). 
For women, corresponding rates were 5·07% in the 
16-week group and 7·92% in the 12-week group 
(p<0·0001). The number of men deferred for low 
haemoglobin at least once during the 2-year trial period 
was 836 (12%) of 6958 in the 12-week group, 1386 (20%) 
of 7030 in the 10-week group, and 2303 (33%) of 7074 in 
the 8-week group; the number of women deferred was 
1202 (18%) of 6774 in the 16-week group, 1685 (24%) of 
6955 in the 14-week group, and 2199 (31%) of 6994 in the 
12-week group. In a non-randomised comparison 
restricted to donors with at least a 2-year history of 
donation before trial enrolment, the deferral rate for low 
haemoglobin among men per session attended in the 
12-week group was 2·5 times greater (2·7% vs 1·1%) 
during the trial than in the 2 years before the study 
(appendix). For women in the 16-week group, the 
corresponding rate was 1·3 times greater (4·8% vs 3·8%) 
during the trial than in the 2 years before the study 
(appendix).
The availability of ferritin data was similar across 
randomised groups (appendix). There were no major 
differences in the baseline characteristics of the randomly 
selected subset of 18 392 participants with ferritin data 
compared with other study participants who provided 
2-year samples (appendix). Mean ferritin concentrations 
at 2 years were lower in donors allocated to shorter 
intervals than in those allocated to the standard frequency 
group (p<0·0001). The numbers of men donating blood 
at 2 years with ferritin concentrations less than 15 µg/L 
were 359 (12%) of 2952 in the 12-week group, 484 (18%) 
of 2737 in the 10-week group, and 598 (24%) of 2525 in 
the 8-week group. For women, the corresponding 
numbers were 558 (22%) of 2572 in the 16-week group, 
643 (26%) of 2470 in the 14-week group, and 655 (27%) of 
2419 in the 12-week group (table 3). An observational 
post-hoc analysis within randomised groups at the 2-year 
examination suggested modest associations between 
haemoglobin or ferritin concentrations and symptoms 
linked with increased frequency of donation (appendix). 
The randomised effects of increased donation frequency 
on self-reported symptoms attenuated nearly uniformly,

but only slightly, after adjustment for haemoglobin or 
ferritin concentrations, or both, measured at the 2-year 
examination (appendix).
In prespecified subgroup analyses (figure 4), in men the 
mean difference in the number of donations over 2 years 
across the randomised groups increased with increasing 
weight and with baseline haemoglobin and ferritin 
concentrations (all p<0·0001). For women, the mean 
difference in the number of donations increased with 
age, the number of donations given in the 2 years 
before the trial, and baseline haemoglobin and ferritin 
concentrations (all p<0·0001). There was no evidence of 
interaction of HFE carrier status and randomised groups 
in relation to amount of blood collected or physical 
component score at 2 years (appendix; all p>0·1). The 
statistical significance of the interactions mentioned 
above persisted in multivariable models including all the 
interactions (data not shown).
Discussion
Our trial’s main outcome was that, over a 2-year period, 
there was a substantial increase in the amount of blood 
collected by reducing the inter-donation blood donation 
intervals used in the UK to those used in blood services 
in the USA or western Europe. For example, reducing 
the inter-donation interval from 12 weeks to 8 weeks in 
men led to an increase of 33% (1·7 units), and reducing 
the interval from 16 weeks to 12 weeks in women led to 
an increase of 24% (0·8 units). Furthermore, prespecified 
subgroup analyses suggested that even greater pro-
portional gains in blood collection could be achieved by 
focusing, for frequent donation, on donors with higher 
than average weight or on those with higher than average 
initial haemoglobin or ferritin concentrations.
By contrast, the trial’s safety findings were more 
nuanced. On the one hand, the trial showed that reducing 
inter-donation intervals did not have a major adverse 
effect on quality of life (assessed with SF-36v2, the most 
widely used and validated instrument available15), cognitive 
function, or physical activity. On the other hand, reducing 
inter-donation intervals resulted in greater self-reporting 
of symptoms potentially related to blood donation, such as 
tiredness, feeling faint, breathlessness, dizziness, restless 
legs, and palpitations, especially among men. Because the 
modest increases we observed in these symptoms were 
not captured by the results on quality of life, SF-36v2 
might not have sufficient sensitivity for minor morbidity 
in our study’s context.22,23 This interpretation is consistent 
with our results showing that reducing inter-donation 
intervals did not result in more severe morbidity. For 
example, we found that reducing inter-donation intervals 
did not result in more severe degrees of breathlessness, 
diagnosis of restless legs syndrome, the need for medical 
attention related to palpitations, actual fainting events, or 
the other major adverse events we recorded.
With regard to biochemical endpoints, we found that 
reducing inter-donation intervals resulted in decreased 
mean haemoglobin and serum ferritin concentrations. 
Whereas the absolute decreases in mean haemoglobin 
concentrations were modest (around 1–2%) at the 2-year 
examination, they were large for serum ferritin (around 
15–30%), reflecting the increased sensitivity of serum 
ferritin compared with that of haemoglobin as an 
indicator of body iron stores.24 In particular, our data 
provide convincing evidence of the cumulative effect of 
donating blood frequently on haemoglobin concentrations 
and iron stores. For example, almost a third of both male 
and female donors allocated to the trial’s shortest 
donation intervals (ie, 8 weeks for men and 12 weeks for 
women) were deferred for low haemoglobin at least once 
during the 2-year trial period. Deferrals are essential to 
protect donors, but they are time consuming and costly 
for blood services and demotivating for donors.25,26
Similarly, by the end of the trial period, about a quarter 
of both male and female donors allocated to the shortest 
donation intervals had depleted iron stores according to 
WHO criteria.19 Perhaps surprisingly, however, we found 
that serum ferritin and haemoglobin concentrations 
explained only a small part of the symptoms linked with 
increased frequency of donation. Previous trials of iron 
supplementation have not reported clear or substantial 
improvement in such symptoms (eg, fatigue or restless 
legs), even among people with iron deficiency anaemia.27,28 
Hence, the results of our trial will invite further study on 
this matter.29
Our data could have several potential implications for 
blood donation practice and policy. First, our data give 
policy makers in the UK the short-term option of allowing 
more frequent collection from donors than is now 
standard, such as for in-demand blood groups or during 
periods of falling supply. A priority, therefore, is to identify 
which donors best tolerate more frequent donation to 
operationalise this policy.30 Second, our data quantify the 
extent of iron depletion within 2 years of repeated 
donation, which could inform safety guidelines for blood 
services that allow more frequent donation than in the UK 
(eg, the USA, France, and Germany). Canadian Blood 
Services have recently lengthened the inter-donation 
interval for women from 8 weeks to 12 weeks.31 The US 
Food and Drug Administration and the AABB (formerly 
the American Association of Blood Banks) have considered 
lengthening the 8-week minimum inter-donation interval 
that currently applies to men and women in the USA to 
reduce the risk of iron deficiency.32,33 Our data highlight 
the absence of randomised evidence for the long-term 
safety of frequent donation beyond a 2-year period.
Third, the results of our study found that about 10% of 
participants were allowed to donate despite having 
baseline 
haemoglobin 
concentrations 
below 
the 
minimum regulatory threshold, suggesting a need to 
review the screening method used in the UK to test 
donors’ eligibility to donate.34,35 (Our study could make 
this assessment because the trial used a haematology 
analyser in addition to the copper sulphate test and

spectrometry method used in routine eligibility checks.) 
In response to these findings, we have started the 
COMPARE study (ISRCTN90871183) to provide a 
systematic, within-person comparison of the relative 
merits of different haemoglobin screening methods.
Fourth, our findings underscore the potential benefits 
of effective communication with blood donors about 
making and keeping donation appointments. Indeed, we 
found that gains in blood collection achieved through 
comprehensive reminders were similar to those obtained 
by reducing inter-donation intervals36,37 (although part of 
this gain is likely to have been due to the effects of 
participating in a research study38). Finally, as this trial 
has identified subsets of donors with readily measured 
characteristics (eg, those with higher than average 
ferritin concentrations) who have greater capacity than 
other donors to give blood more frequently, our study 
contributes to the possibility of increased personalisation 
of blood donation.
Our trial had major strengths. Because it was the first 
randomised trial of the effect of varying the frequency of 
whole blood donation, it provides uniquely reliable insight 
compared with observational studies that are liable to 
confounding.9–11 The trial recorded a range of outcomes 
related to efficiency, safety, and biochemistry (achieved 
through linkage with donor health records, validated 
self-report instruments, and objective measurements), 
making it more comprehensive and valid than previous 
observational studies. Because most donors attended 
blood donation appointments according to the inter-
donation intervals allocated, the trial achieved a clear 
separation between randomised groups. As the trial was 
embedded in the routine blood service, it achieved rapid 
recruitment across the geographical breadth of England.13 
More than 45 000 participants were recruited and randomly 
assigned, providing excellent statistical power to compare 
three sex-specific inter-donation intervals. Since we had 
access to the blood service’s national database, the trial 
achieved 99·5% completeness for the primary outcome. 
Finally, internet-based approaches enabled frequent and 
efficient data collection and in-built quality checks.
The study also had potential limitations. Only about two-
thirds of participants responded to the 2-year questionnaire. 
However, material bias because of selective response 
seems unlikely because questionnaire response rates were 
nearly uniform across randomised groups; moreover, the 
results were similar to those from an analysis of 6-monthly 
interim questionnaires that included 86% of all 
participants. Absence of blinding (which was not possible 
because of the nature of the intervention) could explain 
some of the increased frequency of self-reported symptoms 
among participants allocated to more frequent donation 
than the standard practice. However, any such effects 
could not have influenced the outcomes we assessed 
through laboratory assays or linkage with donor health 
records. At the 2-year final survey, the link between 
measures of iron depletion and symptoms associated 
with more frequent donation could have been weakened 
because there was potential dissociation in time between 
symptoms 
(questionnaires 
asked 
about 
symptoms 
experienced at any time in the previous 6 months) and 
haemoglobin and ferritin concentrations (which were 
measured in samples collected at the 2-year survey). Our 
previous analysis had suggested that participants in the 
INTERVAL study were broadly representative of the 
national donor population of England.13 However, the exact 
degree of generalisability is uncertain because only about 
45% of donors who were invited and attended donation 
sessions agreed to participate in the trial, and because the 
trial required participants to have internet access.
In summary, during a period of 2 years, more frequent 
donation than is standard practice in the UK led to 
collection of substantially more blood without having a 
major effect on donors’ quality of life, physical activity, or 
cognitive function. However, this approach resulted in 
more donation-related symptoms, deferrals, and iron 
deficiency. Our study has provided the first randomised 
evaluation, including precise quantification, of key 
measures of efficiency and safety that blood services 
need to balance to safeguard donor health and maintain 
the blood supply.
