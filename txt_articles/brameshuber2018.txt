T 
cell antigen recognition is invariably tied to the formation of 
an immunological synapse (IS)1 and driven by TCRs on the 
 
T cell binding to antigenic peptides presented by antigen- 
presenting cells (APCs) in the context of MHC molecules (pMHCs). 
Despite moderate TCR:pMHC affinities2, T cells detect single anti-
genic pMHCs among thousands of non-stimulatory pMHCs3,4. 
Mechanisms underlying this exceptional sensitivity are not under-
stood, and it is unclear how extracellular TCR engagement triggers 
the first intracellular activation events. Comprehensive approaches 
are complicated by the transient nature of recognition events 
occurring under the highly dynamic geometric constraints present 
within the nascent IS. Here biochemical methodologies lose much 
of their resolving power because they require membrane disrup-
tion for at least one of the synaptic ligands. Non-invasive molecular 
imaging is hence preferable, especially when complemented with 
structural insights.
A logical starting point to address the underpinnings of T cell 
antigen sensitivity is to determine the composition dynamics of the 
TCR before and during ligand binding5,6. Genetic and biochemi-
cal evidence shows that the clonotypic α 
β TCR heterodimer is 
non-covalently associated with CD3γ 
, CD3δ 
, CD3ε 
 and the CD3ζ 
2  
homodimer required for signaling. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) 
quality-control mechanisms ensure the exclusive egress of prop-
erly assembled TCR–CD3 (TCRα

2) complexes to the 
plasma membrane for antigen recognition7–10.
Multimerized TCR–CD3 complexes were first proposed on the 
basis of density gradient centrifugation and immunoprecipitation 
experiments involving T cell lysates11. Blue native gel electrophore-
sis of T cell lysates and electron microscopy of immunogold-labeled 
 
T cell surfaces invoked higher-order TCR–CD3 as being essen-
tial for promoting and maintaining T cell antigen sensitivity12,13. 
However, detergent solubilization and also cell fixation for electron 
microscopy analysis complicate data interpretation, and the con-
clusions derived were indeed challenged by single-molecule spec-
troscopy on a T cell hybridoma14. Furthermore, clustered anti-TCR 
immunogold particles may reflect enrichment of monomeric TCRs 
in membrane microdomains15,16 rather than TCR oligomerization.
Ligand-induced dimerization or oligomerization has long been 
considered the decisive trigger for TCR–CD3 complexes, in analogy 
to the initial steps driving receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK)-mediated 
signaling, even though TCR–CD3 complexes lack kinase activity 
and require the presence of the TCR-proximal p56lck kinase for acti-
vation. This concept has been mostly fueled by the observation that 
antibodies to TCR or CD3 do not stimulate as monovalent Fabs or 
single-chain variable fragments (scFvs), but do so as bivalent intact 
antibodies, especially when further aggregated17. Furthermore, 
monomeric soluble pMHCs do not activate T cells, while soluble 
pMHC dimers do18,19. Also, the fact that many MHC class II com-
plexes form dimers when crystalized for structure determina-
tion20–22 has been regarded as an inherent propensity of MHC class 
II molecules to form higher-order structures. Elastic light-scattering 
studies conducted on mixtures of soluble TCRs and pMHC have 
also suggested TCR multimerization in a ligand-dependent fash-
ion23. However, some of these findings could not be reproduced for 
all MHC class II proteins studied24 and are hence the cause of much 
controversy. Of note, thus far, ligand-induced multimerization of 
TCRs has not been directly shown within the confines of the IS.
Consequently, many questions regarding the existence, nature 
and regulation of TCR oligomers and their impact on ligand rec-
ognition have remained open. We have thus analyzed the stoichi-
ometry of TCRs within the active IS via single-molecule brightness 
and coincidence analysis, a novel method combining photon 
arrival time analysis with fluorescence correlation spectroscopy 
(PA/FCS) and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-
based imaging. All four approaches supported the widely accepted 
TCR–CD3 subunit stoichiometry, yet revealed TCR monomers as 
the predominant receptor species driving ligand recognition in an 
autonomous fashion.
Monomeric TCRs drive T cell antigen recognition

T cell antigen recognition requires T cell antigen receptors (TCRs) engaging MHC-embedded antigenic peptides (pMHCs) 
within the contact region of a T cell with its conjugated antigen-presenting cell. Despite micromolar TCR:pMHC affinities, 
 
T cells respond to even a single antigenic pMHC, and higher-order TCRs have been postulated to maintain high antigen sensitiv-
ity and trigger signaling. We interrogated the stoichiometry of TCRs and their associated CD3 subunits on the surface of living 
T cells through single-molecule brightness and single-molecule coincidence analysis, photon-antibunching-based fluores-
cence correlation spectroscopy and Förster resonance energy transfer measurements. We found exclusively monomeric TCR–
CD3 complexes driving the recognition of antigenic pMHCs, which underscores the exceptional capacity of single TCR–CD3 
 
complexes to elicit robust intracellular signaling.

Results
Single-color TOCCSL reveals mobile monomeric TCR–CD3 
entities. The TCR surface density of 75 ± 24 molecules/µ 
m2 on the 
plasma membrane of living T cells (Fig. 1a) is too high to allow for 
direct, diffraction-limited imaging of individual TCRs or potential 
TCR oligomers (Fig. 1b). To reveal the TCR stoichiometry on living 
T cells, we opted to employ a single-molecule-based fluorescence 
brightness analysis approach termed TOCCSL (thinning out clusters 
while conserving stoichiometry of labeling) (Fig. 1b,c), as this meth-
odology enables assessment of the degree of protein oligomerization 
below the diffraction limit25–27. T cells from 5C.C7 TCR-transgenic 
mice, which had been stimulated and cultivated in vitro for 7–9 
d, were labeled with site-specifically Alexa Fluor 647–conjugated 
scFvs derived from the monoclonal TCRβ 
-reactive antibody H57-
597 (AF647-H57-scFvs hereafter) and were allowed to adhere to a 
planar glass-supported lipid bilayer functionalized with ICAM-1. 
 
Imaging was conducted with an epifluorescence microscope in 
total internal reflection (TIR) mode as outlined (Fig. 1b,c)28. At 
room temperature, the half-life of TCRβ 
:AF647-H57-scFv bind-
ing was 44 min (Supplementary Fig. 1a), which is substantially 
longer than the time window of 5–15 min allowed for performing 
TOCCSL experiments. By applying a high-powered laser pulse, 
we quantitatively ablated the fluorescence of a spatially defined 
 
area and recorded a control image 1 ms after bleaching to verify

complete photobleaching (Fig. 1c). After a recovery phase of 3–10 s, 
we acquired the so-termed TOCCSL image to record isolated dif-
fraction-limited spots originating from laterally mobile TCR enti-
ties that had entered from the masked cell surface and had therefore 
not undergone any bleaching (Fig. 1c).
To quantify the number of AF647-H57-scFv-labeled TCRβ 
subunits per diffraction-limited spot, we compared the mea-
sured distribution of fluorescence brightness values ρ(B) with the 
brightness distribution of single AF647-H57-scFvs, ρ1, which was 
obtained from the same experiment after prolonged and repeated 
photobleaching or, alternatively, from recording T cells with 150-
fold substoichiometric TCR labeling (Methods). A linear combina-
tion of n-mer contributions, ρn, derived from ρ1 and used to fit the 
distribution ρ(B) (Methods, equation (1)) yielded predominantly 
TCRβ monomers (Fig. 1d). The analysis hinted at a small fraction 
(3% ± 4%) of potential dimeric TCRβ 
 entities (Fig. 1d); however, 
this value is close to the detection limit of the TOCCSL method27. 
In contrast, labeling T cells with site-specifically and stoichiomet-
rically conjugated AF647-scFvs derived from the CD3ε 
-reactive 
KT3 antibody (AF647-KT3-scFvs) gave rise to 74% ± 4% double 
single-molecule brightness events, but no triple or quadruple sin-
gle-molecule brightness events (Fig. 1d), consistent with the exis-
tence of two CD3ε 
 copies per TCR–CD3 complex. We determined 
the fraction of TCR species that were laterally mobile and hence 
accessible to TOCCSL analysis by ensemble fluorescence recovery 
after photobleaching (FRAP) to be 73% ± 
 6% and by single-mole-
cule tracking to be 64% ± 3% (Fig. 1e and Supplementary Fig. 1b,c). 
 
These measurements indicate that laterally mobile TCR–CD3 com-
plexes on non-activated T cells predominantly accommodate one 
TCRβ 
-reactive H57-scFv and two CD3ε 
-reactive KT3-scFvs. They 
are in agreement with the TCRα

Dual-color TOCCSL does not detect mobile higher-order TCRs. 
Because stochastic noise associated with single-molecule photon 
emission and also the limited accuracy of the fitted single-mole-
cule brightness signal complicate TOCCSL-based detection of rare 
higher-order TCR structures, we extended the acquisition protocol 
by introducing a second spectrally resolvable fluorescence channel. 
This dual-color TOCCSL methodology permits the unambiguous 
identification of interaction probabilities below 0.1%29 through 
simple colocalization of differentially labeled single TCR–CD3 
complexes. 5C.C7 TCR-transgenic T cells stimulated and culti-
vated in vitro for 7–9 d were stained for their surface-expressed 
TCRs with a 1:1 mix of Alexa Fluor 488 (AF488)-H57-scFvs and 
AF647-H57-scFvs. Following rapid and quantitative fluorescence 
 
ablation of a synaptic region of interest and partial fluorescence 
recovery, TCR oligomerization was quantified by colocalizing

Fig. 2 | Dual-color colocalization-based ToCCSl does not reveal laterally mobile higher-order TCRs. a, As schematically depicted, dual-color TOCCSL 
analysis relies on the degree of colocalization of differentially labeled monovalent antibody fragments targeting identical or distinct, non-overlapping 
epitopes within TCR–CD3. Sample illumination was performed following the indicated intensity/pulse duration and image acquisition protocol and with 
the use of 488-nm and 647-nm lasers, giving rise to pre-bleach (i), bleach control (ii) and TOCCSL (iii) images collected simultaneously or in short 
succession and spectrally resolved by an emission beam splitter. Photobleaching was performed simultaneously for both colors. TCR–CD3 oligomerization 
was determined by colocalizing the two differentially labeled probe species. Dual-color TOCCSL images represent T cells labeled with the indicated probe 
combinations (right) and recorded 10 s after the bleach pulse. Positions of diffraction-limited spots were determined for both colors and are displayed as 
white circles in the red AF647 channel (left) and the green AF488 channel (right). Corrected positions of one probe projected into the other color channel 
are shown as green and red crosses, respectively. If two fluorescence events registered in different color channels were found within a radius of  
1 pixel (corresponding to 200 nm), they were counted as colocalizing entities (yellow arrow). Scale bars, 4 µ 
m. b, The degree of colocalization was strictly 
dependent on the fluorescent probes applied and is consistent with the subunit stoichiometry of single but not oligomerized TCR–CD3 complexes.

single-molecule fluorescence events originating from differentially 
labeled TCRs (Fig. 2a). For this purpose, the fluorescence emission 
was split into two channels for the individual detection of single 
AF488 and AF647 fluorescence events. We either excited both 
fluorophores after the recovery phase simultaneously (Fig. 2a) or 
separated the recording of the AF488 and AF647 channels by 1 ms 
(Supplementary Fig. 2a) to enable the detection of FRET events 
between differentially labeled H57-scFvs as an additional readout 
for TCR oligomerization. Given unhindered fluorophore rotation, 
FRET yields are inversely proportional to the sixth power of the dis-
tance between the corresponding fluorescent dyes, and FRET can 
hence be employed to score for spatial proximity in the nanometer 
range. For the FRET dye pair AF488:AF647, the calculated inter-dye 
distance giving rise to half-maximal energy transfer (Förster radius 
R0) amounted to 5.6 nm (Supplementary Table 1), roughly covering 
the length of the TCR.
Positions of individual TCRs were determined for both spectral 
channels with an accuracy of about 20 nm, corrected for chromatic 
aberration and overlaid to probe for colocalization within a 200-
nm radius (Supplementary Fig. 2b–d). After correcting for false-
positive events (Methods), the fraction of colocalized events was 
determined. Where applicable, FRET yields were also quantified 
for all double-positive single-molecule events. The degree of probe 
pairing between AF488-H57-scFvs and AF647-H57-scFvs at 24 °C 
and 37 °C was negligible (Fig. 2b and Table 1).
To maximize the likelihood of revealing TCR oligomers that 
might be cryptic to H57-scFv-based detection, we repeated dual-
color TOCCSL experiments using dye-conjugated KJ25-Fabs tar-
geting the variable region of the TCRβ 
 chain. The epitope of KJ25 
overlaps with the TCRβ 
 region involved in antigen binding and 
should hence be accessible on all TCRβ 
 subunits capable of pMHC 
binding in putative oligomeric structures30. Of note, TCR surface 
densities measured with KJ25-Fabs and H57-scFvs were compa-
rable (Supplementary Fig. 2e), indicating similar if not identical 
accessibility of both antibody fragments to surface-resident TCRs. 
As observed with H57-scFv, only negligible colocalization and sin-
gle-molecule FRET events were detected with KJ25-Fabs (Fig. 2b  
and Table 1). However, when applied in combination as AF488-
KJ25-Fabs and AF647-H57-scFvs, we detected a high fraction 
(21%) of dual-color signals (Fig. 2b, Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. 
2f), likely indicating one TCRβ 
 subunit carrying two labels in close 
proximity. In addition, the combined use of AF488-KT3-scFvs and 
AF647-KT3-scFvs yielded a large proportion (10%) of double-posi-
tive events in dual-color TOCCSL experiments (Fig. 2b and Table 1), 
 
reflective of two CD3ε 
 copies per TCR–CD3 complex. As such, 
dual-color TOCCSL results from all label combinations applied 
were consistent with a subunit stoichiometry of monovalent, but 
not of higher-order, TCR–CD3 entities. Moreover, the close label 
apposition within TOCCSL entities originating from AF488-KT3-
scFvs and AF647-KT3-scFvs as well as from AF488-KJ25-Fabs and 
AF647-H57-scFvs invariably gave rise to quantifiable single-mole-
cule FRET signals (Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. 2f). These find-
ings underscore the robustness of the TOCCSL approach and imply 
that laterally mobile TCR–CD3 complexes do not form higher-order 
structures with a lifetime greater than 3–10 s, that is, the duration of 
fluorescence recovery in our TOCCSL experiments.
PA/FCS with enhanced temporal resolution does not reveal TCR 
oligomers. TOCCSL invariably involves a step of fluorescence recov-
ery lasting 3–10 s. Consequently, short-lived protein complexes may 
elude detection in the subsequent TOCCSL image if they dissociate 
during this time. To investigate whether TCR–CD3 complexes form 
transient higher-order structures with a half-life below the duration 
of fluorescence recovery, we probed the number of dye molecules 
associated with a given TCR–CD3 complex via analysis of coinciding 
photon arrival times (photon antibunching, PA)31–33 and fluorescence 
correlation spectroscopy (FCS). This approach relies on the fact that 
a single fluorophore cannot emit more than one photon when excited 
with a light pulse that is shorter than its characteristic fluorescence 
lifetime. As a consequence, coincident photons resulting from such 
excitation pulses must originate from different independent emitters, 
a property that can be exploited to quantify the number of fluoro-
phores in a given observation area within the plasma membrane33. 
Unrelated emitters can be discriminated from those attached to the 
same complex because they diffuse through the illuminated spot in 
an uncorrelated fashion. In contrast, fluorophores attached to the 
same entity move in a correlated manner (Fig. 3a). As determined 
from the normalized autocorrelation function (ACF), FCS-based 
measurements involving T cells stained with Abberior Star 635P 
(AS635P)-H57-scFv yielded a coefficient for lateral TCR diffusion

(D) of 0.034 ± 0.014 µ 
m2/s (Fig. 3b), which is in good agreement 
with the value measured through single-molecule tracking experi-
ments (D = 0.037 ± 0.002 µ 
m2/s; Supplementary Fig. 1b). Considering 
a confocal spot area of 0.08 µ 
m2, the degree to which fluorophores 
undergo uncorrelated diffusion can be readily quantified within a 
single experiment for lag times equal to or greater than 80 ms. This in 
turn allows determination of the average number of transient higher-
order TCR–CD3 entities with a lifetime between 100 and 300 ms, as 
quantified by the average FCS transition time32.
For these experiments involving both PA and FCS (termed PA/
FCS), we stained T cells quantitatively with AS635P-H57-scFv, 
AS635P-KJ25-Fab to target TCRβ or CD3ε 
-reactive AS635P-KT3-
scFv, as a positive control for correlated diffusion behavior of dye 
pairs (Fig. 3b). Measurements were conducted with 5C.C7 TCR-
transgenic T cells stimulated and cultivated in vitro for 7–9 d and 
confronted with non-stimulatory planar lipid bilayers featuring 
ICAM-1 to promote cell adhesion (Fig. 3a). For T cells labeled with 
the H57-scFv or KJ25-Fab antibodies, coincident photon pairs with 
zero lag time gave rise to almost the same autocorrelation ampli-
tude as photon pairs with a lag time of 2 s (Fig. 3b), indicating that 
coinciding photon pairs were emitted from fluorophores attached to 
TCRs diffusing independently with respect to one another. Fitting 
the autocorrelation curves with a theoretical model (Methods) indi-
cated an average number of emitters of 1.09 ± 0.08 (AS635P-H57-
scFv) or 1.14 ± 0.08 (AS635P-KJ25-Fab) per freely diffusing TCR 
complex (Fig. 3c). As a monomer reference, PA/FCS experiments 
carried out with soluble AS635P-H57-scFvs and AS635P-KJ25-
Fabs diffusing freely in imaging buffer (Supplementary Fig. 3a,b) 
 
yielded values of 1.17 ± 
 0.01 emitters (AS635P-H57-scFv) and 
1.26 ± 0.01 emitters (AS635P-KJ25-Fab) (Fig. 3c), which can be 
attributed to a small fraction of antibody fragments carrying more 
than one AS635P dye molecule. In contrast, T cell–bound AS635P-
KT3-scFvs showed correlated diffusion behavior with 1.86 ± 0.22 
emitters (Fig. 3b), as expected from two CD3ε subunits per TCR–
CD3 complex. Experiments carried out with AS635P-KT3-scFv in 
solution yielded an average number of emitters of 1.14 ± 0.01 (Fig. 3c  
and Supplementary Fig. 3c), which is similar to the number of emitters 
detected with AS635P-H57-scFvs. As such, PA/FCS did not reveal the 
existence of transient higher-order TCR–CD3 structures, while it was 
sensitive enough to confirm the presence of two yet not more CD3ε 
subunits per TCR–CD3 entity. We therefore conclude that laterally 
mobile TCR–CD3 complexes are exclusively monomeric in nature.

FRET recordings fail to reveal higher-order TCRs. TOCCSL and 
PA/FCS do not account for immobile entities, as the rationale of 
these methodologies rests on the lateral mobility of the structures 
of interest. To address TCR homo-association in a fashion that 
was independent of TCR mobility, we measured FRET between 
antibody-fragment-labeled TCRs. 5C.C7 TCR-transgenic T cells 
stimulated and cultivated in vitro for 7–9 d were stained with equi-
molar amounts of H57-scFvs site-specifically conjugated to either 
AF647 or Alexa Fluor 555 (AF555) and placed onto lipid bilay-
ers harboring ICAM-1, B7-1 and, optionally, I-Ek loaded with the 
moth cytochrome c 88-103 (MCC) peptide (I-Ek/MCC), the nom-
inal 5C.C7 TCR ligand for T cell activation (Fig. 4a). H57-scFv 
binding to the TCR does not interfere with antigen recognition28,34, 
rendering it suitable to probe both free and ligand-engaged TCRs. 
Positioning the fluorophores on the H57-scFv probes at a site close 
to the antibody’s paratope28 ensured FRET yields most closely 
reflecting distances between TCRs (Supplementary Fig. 4a,b). 
After cells had fully adhered, we determined the FRET efficiency 
by FRET donor recovery after FRET acceptor photobleaching in 
TIR mode. Free dye rotation, a requisite for meaningful FRET 
data interpretation, was verified by anisotropy measurements 
(Supplementary Fig. 1d).
Placing T cells onto non-stimulatory planar supported 
 
lipid bilayers with ICAM-1 and B7-1 did not give rise to

measurable FRET values above those expected from random 
molecular encounters (Fig. 4b,c), as simulated using a Monte Carlo 
approach (Methods and Supplementary Fig. 5a). No FRET was 
detectable in the presence of nominal antigenic pMHCs (Fig. 4b,c), 
either within central supramolecular activation clusters (cSMACs) 
of mature synapses or within emerging TCR microclusters of nascent 
IS (Fig. 4d), which were ~2.5-fold enriched in TCRs (Fig. 4e). 
 
Even when enhancing the sensitivity of the FRET-based assay by 
increasing the FRET donor:FRET acceptor ratio from 1 to 3, we did 
not observe FRET, either in the absence (Supplementary Fig. 5b) 
or presence (Fig. 4d) of activating I-Ek/MCC. We also switched the 
FRET donor from AF555 to Alexa Fluor 568 (AF568) to increase the 
Förster radius from 5.1 to 8.3 nm, but nonetheless we did not detect 
FRET above values expected from random molecular encounters 
(Supplementary Fig. 5a,c).
To ensure that we had not missed TCR multimerization events in 
the course of initial TCR:pMHC engagement, we focused our analy-
sis on initial T cell contacts made with planar supported lipid bilay-
ers functionalized with ICAM-1, B7-1 and high densities (about 500 
molecules/µ 
m2) of agonist pMHCs. While such contacts showed 
vigorous TCR-proximal signaling, as verified via simultaneously 
recorded synaptic recruitment of retrovirally expressed ZAP70-
GFP (Supplementary Fig. 5d), they did not give rise to measurable 
FRET between TCR-bound H57-scFvs (Supplementary Fig. 5e). 
Only after cross-linking site-specifically biotinylated preassociated 
TCRβ 
-reactive H57-scFv FRET probes via divalent streptavidin 
(Fig. 4b,c and Supplementary Fig. 5f) or after dimerizing H57-scFv-
labeled TCRs with a Vβ 
3 (5C.C7 TCR)-reactive KJ25 monoclonal 
antibody (Fig. 4b,f) we observed FRET efficiencies of 9% ± 1% and 
17% ± 1%, respectively, which testify to the overall robustness of the 
FRET-based assay.
Next, we measured FRET with probe combinations reporting 
close distances with the TCR–CD3 complex. The combined use of 
AF555-KJ25-Fabs and AF647-H57-scFvs, which bind to non-over-
lapping epitopes within TCRβ 
, resulted in a FRET yield of 18% ± 3% 
(Fig. 4b,g), while employing AF568-KT3-scFvs together with 
AF647-KT3-scFvs, which occupy two juxtaposed copies of CD3ε 
within individual TCR–CD3 complexes, gave rise to a FRET yield

of 18% ± 0.5% (Fig. 4b,h). Synaptic FRET yields between TCR–
CD3-bound AF568-H57-scFv and AF647-KT3-scFv amounted to 
25% ± 2% (Fig. 4b,h), indicating the presence of two FRET acceptor 
dyes at close distance to one FRET donor fluorophore within the com-
plex. In contrast, we did not observe any appreciable FRET signals 
when labeling TCRs with AF555-KJ25-Fab and AF647-KJ25-Fab, 
 
which targets 5C.C7 TCRβ 
 at a site involved in pMHC binding (Fig. 
4g). In summary, while FRET reported on the close proximity of 
CD3ε 
 and the TCR and also of the CD3ε 
 subunits within individual 
TCR–CD3 complexes, it did not indicate any FRET-sensitive prox-
imity of individual TCRs. In combination, our measurements imply 
that at least the large majority, if not all, immobile or ligand-engaged 
TCRs are monomeric in nature.
FRET-based analysis does not support ligand-induced TCR 
oligomerization. To circumvent potential complications associated 
with the use of TCR-attached probes, we followed an alternative 
FRET-based strategy involving site-specific fluorescence label-
ing of pMHCs (Fig. 5a,b and Supplementary Fig. 4c). To this end, 
MHC-embedded MCC was coupled at either the N or C terminus 
to AF555 or AF647 to serve as the FRET donor and FRET accep-
tor when presented via planar supported lipid bilayer–embedded 
I-Ek to T cells. For FRET measurements, 5C.C7 TCR-transgenic 
 
T cells stimulated and cultivated in vitro for 7–9 d were exposed to 
planar supported lipid bilayers harboring ICAM-1 and B7-1 as well 
as AF555-I-Ek/MCC and AF647-I-Ek/MCC at a density of 100 mol-
ecules/µ 
m2 or higher and FRET donor increase was monitored after 
FRET acceptor ablation. In the absence of T cells, all three different 
pMHC combinations, that is, MCC-AF555(N):MCC-AF647(N), 
MCC-AF555(C):MCC-AF647(C) 
and 
MCC-AF555(N):MCC-
AF647(C), gave rise to slight FRET signals due to random molec-
ular encounters of freely diffusing pMHCs, which increased with 
increasing pMHC densities and matched values predicted by Monte 
Carlo simulations (Fig. 5c, Methods and Supplementary Fig. 6a–e). 
Of note, synaptic FRET yields were equal to or even lower than 
those measured outside the synapse, despite considerable pMHC 
enrichment due to TCR binding (Fig. 5d,e).
The fraction of TCR-bound pMHCs can be readily quanti-
fied within a region of interest (Fig. 5a,b) by means of pMHC 
entrapment above initial pMHC densities before the addition of T 
cells28. We hence focused our analysis on synaptic areas enriched 
in pMHCs, such as TCR microclusters, as FRET values measured 
therein are reflective of the oligomerization state of TCR-engaged 
pMHCs. We did not observe any FRET attributable to TCR bind-
ing within synapses (Fig. 5e). On the contrary, minimally elevated 
FRET yields detected underneath TCR microclusters were signifi-
cantly below those measured in cell-free planar supported lipid 
bilayers featuring corresponding pMHC densities (Fig. 5d) and 
those predicted by our Monte Carlo simulations (Fig. 5c), suggest-
ing that pMHCs entrapped by activated TCRs are actively spaced 
from one another in microclusters at distances that are larger than 
those susceptible to FRET-based detection. Once observable, this 
FRET reduction is independent of F-actin or microtubules, as is 
indicated by pharmacological inhibition studies (Supplementary 
Fig. 6f). Inhibition of the TCR-proximal kinase p56lck via PP2 
disturbed TCR microcluster formation only in part, and FRET 
yields measured between TCR-bound pMHCs accumulated 
underneath microclusters of PP2-treated T cells were still reduced 
(Supplementary Fig. 6f). We also addressed the possibility of gly-
cosylated and immobile higher-order TCR entities assembled via 
galectins and other glycoproteins35, which could link TCRs at dis-
tances larger than those accessible by FRET. Such entities should 
break apart into mobile TCR monomers upon exposure to lactose, 
which outcompetes galectin binding. However, as lactose treatment 
did not increase the mobile fraction of TCRs, we consider this pos-
sibility unlikely (Supplementary Fig. 1e). In conclusion, even mini-
mally invasive FRET using site-specifically labeled agonist ligands 
as FRET probes yielded no indication of TCR-induced homotypic 
pMHC interactions. This observation renders scenarios of synaptic 
TCRs engaging nominal pMHC ligands as higher-order structures 
highly unlikely.
Discussion
Here we assessed the stoichiometry of mobile and immobile TCRs 
expressed on the surface of living T cells using non-invasive imag-
ing and FCS methodologies. Despite affording single-molecule 
sensitivity, none of the applied approaches provided evidence for 
the existence of constitutive or ligand-induced higher-order TCR 
structures. We hence consider constitutive as well as ligand-induced 
TCR oligomers irrelevant for the maintenance of antigen sensitivity 
and signal generation.
FRET-based measurements conducted to account for immobile, 
slowly diffusing or ligand-engaged TCR entities failed to provide 
any data in favor of higher-order structures, while they proved sen-
sitive enough to reveal TCR dimers induced via divalent strepta-
vidin or full anti-Vβ 
3 antibody. We consider it highly unlikely that 
the absence of FRET signals resulted merely from limitations of 
the FRET systems applied. First, positioning FRET dye combina-
tions with Förster radii of 5.1–8.2 nm within the TCR–CD3 com-
plex revealed inter-dye distances of up to 15 nm, that is, spanning 
the dimensions of more than two TCR–CD3 complexes, even when 
such interactions are present in low abundance. Second, the use of 
stimulatory pMHCs as FRET probes provided us with additional 
flexibility in label positioning, yet did not result in any detect-
able ensemble FRET signals above background, even when focus-
ing predominantly on pMHCs accumulating as a result of TCR 
engagement in TCR microclusters. In fact, the opposite was true, 
as inter-pMHC FRET measured underneath these TCR-enriched 
structures was significantly lower than FRET measured in cell-free 
planar supported lipid bilayers featuring freely diffusing pMHCs in 
comparable amounts. This suggests that signaling TCRs coalescing 
in microclusters are actively kept apart by yet to be identified cell-
intrinsic mechanisms.
All FRET-based experiments involving scFvs or Fabs as FRET 
probes were carried out at 24 °C to allow for a quantitative readout 
unaffected by probe dissociation, hence leaving open the possibil-
ity of TCR oligomerization at 37 °C. In such a case, higher-order 
TCR structures would be irrelevant for maintaining T cell antigen 
sensitivity, which is unaffected at 24 °C28. FRET-based experiments 
conducted with the use of pMHC FRET probes at 37 °C indeed gave 
rise to identical results, rendering temperature-dependent TCR 
oligomerization improbable.
We cannot rule out the possibility that the use of antibody frag-
ments prevented TCR oligomerization and, hence, interfered with 
its detection. However, the existence of such hypothetical oligomers 
cannot explain the exquisite sensitivity of T cell antigen recognition, 
which is not affected by TCRβ 
–H57-scFv binding28,34. Alternatively, 
already-formed TCR oligomers might be accessible to one antibody 
probe only owing to a unique quaternary structure and could thus 
evade detection via TOCCSL, PA/FCS and FRET. However, this is 
highly unlikely given that targeting TCRβ at two different non-
overlapping epitopes led to virtually identical results while probing 
CD3ε with KT3-scFvs in TOCCSL and PA/FCS experiments resulted 
predominantly in dimer signals reflective of single TCR–CD3 com-
plexes, but no tetramer, hexamer or octamer signals corresponding to 
TCR dimers, trimers or tetramers. Decorating 5C.C7 TCR-transgenic 
T cells with KJ25-Fab causes a complete blockade of pMHC recogni-
tion; hence, any antibody-inaccessible TCRs as part of larger com-
plexes would not be able to engage pMHCs in a productive manner, 
and TCR oligomers would not bind more than one pMHC at any 
given time. Indeed, we did not observe any TCR-engaged pMHC 
oligomers in close enough proximity for FRET-based detection.

Our data do not contradict T cell activation mechanisms via 
TCR multimerization enforced by soluble ligands. Signaling may 
result from TCR segregation from otherwise accessible phos-
phatases, yet is likely to deviate from the mechanisms underlying 
physiological stimulation, especially when antigen is sparse. In fact, 
TCR-proximal signaling induced by soluble antibodies is barely 
influenced by treatment with actin-depolymerizing drugs, while 
APC-mediated stimulation is inhibited, even when drug interfer-
ence occurs after synapse formation36.
In conclusion, we rule out the possibility that TCR oligomeriza-
tion, dynamic or constitutive in nature, has a major role in antigen 
sensitization and the generation of intracellular signaling events 
 
following extracellular TCR engagement within the IS. Hence, 
 
other processes may be instrumental, including serial TCR engage-
ment by agonist pMHCs, kinetic segregation of differentially sized 
receptor–ligand pairs within the permitted synaptic space37,38, 
changes within the TCR39 and the TCR–CD3 complex40–43 upon 
ligand engagement, and even receptor complex deformations 
caused by cellular forces44,45. Furthermore, the monomeric nature of 
ligand-engaged TCR–CD3 complexes highlights their function as 
the catalytic center for the recruitment, activation and subsequent 
rapid release of the TCR-proximal kinase ZAP70 for downstream 
signal amplification46.

Methods
Tissue culture and retroviral transduction. Primary T cells were isolated from 
5C.C7 α 
β TCR–transgenic mice and cultured as described47 in T cell medium, 
that is, RPMI containing 10% FCS (Sigma-Aldrich), 2 mM l-glutamine (Irvine 
Scientific), 100 U/ml penicillin-streptomycin and 50 μ 
M β 
-mercaptoethanol 
(Sigma-Aldrich), which had been supplemented with 1 µ 
M C18 reverse-phase 
HPLC–purified MCC 88-103 peptide (sequence: ANERADLIAYLKQATK, T cell 
epitope underlined; Elim Biopharmaceuticals). T cells were used for experiments 
7–9 d after stimulation. Retroviral transfection of T cells with ZAP70-GFP was 
performed as published47,48. Freshly isolated primary OT-1 TCR-transgenic T cells 
were cultured in T cell medium containing 1 µ 
M C18 reverse-phase HPLC–purified 
ovalbumin peptide 257-264 (sequence: SIINFEKL, T cell epitope underlined; Elim 
Biopharmaceuticals) as described49 and used 8 d after stimulation.
Ethical compliance statement. All animal experimentation (related to breeding, 
sacrifice for T cell isolation) was evaluated by the ethics committee of the Medical 
University of Vienna and approved by the Federal Ministry of Science, Research 
and Economy, BMWFW (BMWFW-66.009/0378-WF/V/3b/2016). Animal 
husbandry and experimentation were performed under national laws (Federal 
Ministry of Science, Research and Economy, Vienna, Austria) and the ethics 
committee of the Medical University of Vienna and according to the guidelines of 
the Federation of Laboratory Animal Science Associations (FELASA).
Protein expression and functionalization. ICAM-1-His12 and B7-1-His12 were 
expressed using a baculovirus expression system and purified as described28. 
I-Ekα 
-His6 and I-Ekβ 
-His6 were expressed as inclusion bodies in Escherichia coli, 
refolded in vitro in the presence of MCC88-103 or the MCC(ANP) space-holder 
peptide (sequence: ANERADLIAYL[ANP]QATK) (Elim Biopharmaceuticals) as 
described30,50,51, and purified via Ni2+-NTA resin affinity chromatography followed 
by size-exclusion S-200 chromatography using an Äkta purifier system (GE 
Healthcare Life Sciences). Peptides used for pMHC-based FRET measurements 
included MCC FRET (N) (CSDLIAYLKQATKGG, T cell epitope underlined) 
and MCC FRET (C) (SSDLIAYLKQATKGGSC, T cell epitope underlined) (both 
from Elim Biopharmaceuticals). After purification via C18 reverse-phase HPLC, 
peptides were conjugated at the cysteine residue with AF555 or AF647 maleimide 
(Thermo Fisher Scientific), purified again by HPLC and confirmed in identity by 
liquid chromatography–electrospray ionization mass spectroscopy. For production 
of AF555-/AF647-pMHC-(N) or AF555-/AF647-pMHC-(C), I-Ek-2 × His6 
preloaded with MCC(ANP) was incubated in peptide-exchange buffer (PBS plus 
100 mM citric acid, pH 5.1) with the corresponding quantitatively fluorescence-
labeled MCC FRET (N) or MCC FRET (C) peptides present in 20-fold excess 
for 48 h at room temperature. Following peptide exchange, properly folded I-Ek 
molecules loaded with fluorescence-labeled MCC FRET (N/C) peptides were 
purified via S-200 size chromatography and subjected to spectrophotometry 
to verify quantitative peptide labeling and peptide exchange. For KT3-scFv 
generation, mRNA was prepared from the KT3 hybridoma using TRIzol (Thermo 
Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s instructions  
(to serve as a template for 5′ 
 rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE; Thermo 
Fisher Scientific). VH and VL antibody domains were fused as illustrated in 
Supplementary Fig. 4d,e and mutagenized for site-specific label attachment 
(QuikChange, Agilent).
H57-scFv and KT3-scFv were expressed in inclusion bodies, refolded, site-
specifically labeled with maleimide-functionalized AF488, AF555, AF568, AF647 
(all Thermo Fisher Scientific) or Abberior Star 635 P (Abberior) and purified 
as described28. Label positions within the H57- and KT3-scFvs are indicated in 
Supplementary Fig. 4d–g. The protein-to-dye ratio ranged between 0.95 and 1.0 for 
all Alexa Fluor dye conjugation products as determined by photospectrometry. To 
serve as a positive FRET donor control, H57-scFv was equipped via a C-terminal 
cysteine (J4; Supplementary Fig. 4f) with maleimide-TCO (Jena Bioscience) 
and then conjugated via click chemistry to a synthetic N-terminally biotinylated 
FRET donor peptide linker (biotin-GGGGSY(GGGGS)2KGGGGSC-maleimide-
6-Me-tetrazine; Elim Biopharmaceuticals), which had been labeled with AF555 
N-succinimidyl ester at its lysine residue (underlined). The positive FRET 
acceptor control consisted of a J4 H57-scFv linked via its C-terminal cysteine 
residue to maleimide-DBCO (Jena Bioscience) and subsequently conjugated via 
click chemistry to a synthetic N-terminally biotinylated FRET acceptor peptide 
linker (biotin-GGCGS(GPGGA)5GGKYGGSK-azide; INTAVIS), which was 
labeled at its lysine residue (underlined) with AF647 N-succinimidyl ester. Prior 
to click conjugation, both FRET donor and FRET acceptor peptide linkers had 
been purified by C18 reverse-phase HPLC and confirmed in identity by mass 
spectrometry. T cells were decorated with both H57-scFv-biotin FRET dye 
linker probes in equimolar amounts, which were subsequently cross-linked with 
streptavidin engineered to harbor two biotin-binding sites positioned in trans52,53.
H57-scFv used in photon arrival time experiments was conjugated with 
Abberior-Star 635 P maleimide (AS635P-H57-scFv), yielding a protein-to-dye ratio 
of 0.9.
KJ25 monoclonal antibodies were purified from hybridoma culture 
supernatant (serum-free medium, Gibco, 12045076) by affinity chromatography 
using GammaBind Plus Sepharose (GE Healthcare Life Sciences) according 
to the manufacturer’s instructions and then subjected to size-exclusion S-200 
chromatography for the removal of aggregates. For Fab production, purified 
KJ25 monoclonal antibodies were processed using the Pierce Fab Preparation kit 
(Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Fabs were 
subjected to S-75 size-exclusion chromatography and concentrated to  
1 mg/ml by ultrafiltration (Merck, UFC901096). After addition of 10% 1 M 
NaHCO3, the protein was allowed to react with a twofold molar surplus of 
fluorescent dyes functionalized with succinimidyl ester. The reaction mix was lastly 
subjected to S-75 size-exclusion chromatography to remove unreacted dye and 
arrive at monomeric-dye-conjugated KJ25-Fabs.
Decoration of T cells with antibody fragments. 5 × 105 T cells were washed 
in ice-cold Hank’s buffered salt solution (HBSS; Lonza) supplemented with 2% 
FCS (imaging buffer) and resuspended in a volume of 30 µ 
l of imaging buffer. 
Respective fluorescence-labeled probes were added until saturation of binding 
had been achieved after incubation for 20 min at 4 °C, as determined in preceding 
titration experiments (all H57-scFvs, 150 ng for 105 cells in 30 µ 
l; KT3-scFvs, 3 µ 
g 
for 105 cells in 30 µ 
l; KJ25-Fabs, 300 ng for 105 cells in 30 µ 
l; see also Supplementary 
Fig. 1f). Quantitative cell labeling was verified by flow cytometry analysis applying 
different incubation times and probe concentrations. After incubation, cells were 
washed twice with imaging buffer and stored on ice before experiments.
Major deviations from stoichiometric labeling of T cells with H57-scFvs and 
KJ25-Fabs could be excluded for a number of reasons:
1.  
The site-directed nature of the maleimide-/unpaired cysteine-mediated 
labeling procedure and measured protein:dye ratios of close to 1 (see above) 
ensured the presence of one fluorophore per probe;
2.  
Single-color TOCCSL experiments involving AF647-KT3-scFv gave rise 
to ~74% double-positive events (Fig. 1d), indicating that dark states for 
AF647 amount at the most to (1 – sqrt(0.74)) × 100%), or 14%. This is an 
overestimate due to potential complications associated with the TOCCSL 
method itself (for example, partial bleaching of CD3ε 
 dimers located at the 
boundary of the bleach spot) and with labeling to saturation, which is more 
complex for KT3-scFvs than for H57-scFvs and KJ25Fabs, as indicated by 
the T cell/label saturation curves (Supplementary Fig. 1f);
3.  
Measuring TCR surface densities employing H57-scFv conjugated to AF488, 
AF555, AF568 and AF647 gave almost identical results, implying that dark 
AF488, AF555 and AF568 dyes are present at a fraction of 14% or less;
4.  
Exposing T cells to KJ25-Fab leads to a complete blockade of T cell antigen 
recognition of nominal pMHCs (I-Ek/MCC), indicating occupation of all 
TCRs involved in antigen binding by this antibody, as is expected given 
that the KJ25 epitope overlaps with the TCR paratope binding to pMHC. 
All TCRs, which are relevant for ligand recognition, are hence accessible 
to KJ25-Fab labeling. Substoichiometric labeling of TCRs by H57-scFvs is 
also highly improbable, as TCR surface density measurements based on 
KJ25-Fabs and H57-scFvs give rise to identical results. This assessment is 
consistent with the lack of FRET between TCR-engaged pMHCs.
Drug perturbations and glycosylation interference. For pharmacological 
inhibition of actin/tubulin polymerization after the formation of microclusters, 
latrunculin B (Sigma-Aldrich) and nocodazole (Sigma-Aldrich) were added to 
the measurement chamber to final concentrations of 10 and 100 µ 
M, respectively. 
For p56lck kinase inhibition, cells were pretreated with 10 µ 
M PP2 (Sigma-Aldrich, 
P0042) for 60 min before addition to the planar supported lipid bilayer. PP2 
remained in solution during the measurement. For glycosylation interference, 
T cells were incubated for 20 min on ice with 20 mM lactose or 20 mM sucrose 
diluted in imaging buffer. Control experiments were carried out in imaging buffer. 
During measurements, lactose or sucrose was present at a 2 nM concentration.
Preparation of planar glass-supported lipid bilayers (planar supported 
lipid bilayers). Vesicles containing 90% 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-
phosphocholine (POPC) and 10% 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-[N(5-amino-1-
carboxypentyl)iminodiacetic acid]succinyl[nickelsalt] (Ni-DOGS NTA; Avanti 
Polar Lipids) were prepared as described28 and stored in PBS. Cover glass slides 
(#1.5, 24 × 60 mm; Menzel) were cleaned for 30 min in Piranha solution containing 
concentrated H2SO4 and 30% H2O2 (both from Sigma-Aldrich) at a ratio of 7:3. 
Slides were rinsed with purified water, dried under a nitrogen stream and attached 
with the use of dental imprint silicon putty (Picodent twinsil 22, Picodent) to 
LabTek eight-well chambers (Nunc), from which the glass bottom had been 
removed as published51. Glass slides were incubated with a tenfold-diluted vesicle 
solution for 10 min before they were extensively rinsed with PBS (Lonza). For 
functionalization, formed planar supported lipid bilayers were incubated with His-
tagged proteins for 75 min at room temperature and then rinsed with PBS. Prior 
to the addition of T cells, PBS was exchanged with imaging buffer. pMHC surface 
densities were calculated by comparing the ensemble fluorescence signal with that 
of individual fluorophores.
Determination of TCR surface densities. Average surface densities were 
calculated from T cells in contact with ICAM-1-functionalized planar supported 
lipid bilayers and labeled to saturation with AF647-H57-scFv. The T cell brightness

per µ 
m2 (measured in TIR configuration) was then divided by the fluorescence 
signal of a single AF647-H57-scFv. The latter was determined by incubating T cells 
with a mixture of unlabeled/AF647-H57-scFvs at a ratio of 150:1 and measuring 
the brightness of individual diffraction-limited spots.
Microscopy—TOCCSL. Single-molecule experiments were performed as 
described26,29. Briefly, an Axiovert 200 microscope equipped with a 100 × N.A. = 1.46 
Plan-Apochromat objective (Zeiss) was used for illuminating samples in objective-
based TIR configuration via the epiport by 488-nm (Sapphire, Coherent) or 647-
nm (Innova I-90, Coherent) laser light sources with a power density of 1–5 kW/
cm2 on the sample. For exact timing, acousto-optic modulators (Isomet) were used. 
A slit aperture (Thorlabs) with a width of 5–10 µ 
m in the sample plane was used 
as the field stop. Timing protocols were generated and executed with the use of 
an in-house-written package implemented in LABVIEW (National Instruments). 
After appropriate filtering (zt488/640 rpc, Chroma; FF01-538/685-25, Semrock), 
emitted signals were split into two color channels using a custom-made dichroic 
wedge (Chroma) and imaged on the same back-illuminated, liquid-nitrogen-cooled 
CCD camera (Micro-Max, Roper Scientific). For precise temperature control, an in-
house-built incubator equipped with a heating unit and an objective heater (PeCon) 
were used. Unless noted otherwise, experiments were carried out at 24 °C.
After recording a pre-bleach image with a power density of 1 kW/cm2 and an 
illumination time of 5 ms (Fig. 1c, pulse (i)), samples were bleached with a laser 
pulse applied for 400 ms with a power density of 5 kW/cm2. Following a recovery 
time of 2 to 10 s, up to 18 images were recorded at 20-ms intervals with the same 
settings as used for the pre-bleach image. Complete photoablation was tested by 
acquiring an image 1 ms after bleaching (Fig. 1c, pulse (ii)). The recovery time was 
adjusted to allow for reentry of unbleached signals, and the first image (Fig. 1c,  
pulse (iii)) was used for brightness analysis (TOCCSL image). The last image 
served to determine the brightness of a single fluorophore. Because of the low 
photostability of AF647, the probability of observing more than one fluorescent 
AF647 dye molecule per diffraction-limited spot in the last image is negligible. 
Alternatively, T cells were decorated with a 1:150 mixture of AF647-scFvs and 
unlabeled scFvs, placed on planar supported lipid bilayers, and the single-spot 
brightness was determined for individual AF647-scFvs. Both approaches gave rise to 
similar results. For dual-color TOCCSL experiments (Fig. 2a), the pre-bleach images 
were recorded with a delay of 20 ms, the bleach pulses were applied simultaneously 
and the TOCCSL images were either recorded simultaneously (Fig. 2a, pulse (iii)) or 
in series with a 1-ms time gap between the separate acquisitions of the two channels 
(Supplementary Fig. 2a).
To ensure TOCCSL analysis unbiased by the potentially slower diffusion of 
higher-order TCR–CD3 entities, we took the following steps: (i) after having 
tracked individual TCR–CD3 entities over time, a statistical analysis of observed 
step lengths (of individually tracked entities) yielded two distinct fractions: 
an immobile fraction (~30%) and a mobile fraction (~70%). A histogram of 
the diffusion constants of individually traced entities gave rise to a unimodal 
distribution (Supplementary Fig. 1g). (ii) Prolonging the recovery time (by up to 
10 s) to get access to slowly diffusing entities did not influence the outcome. (iii) 
Depletion of fast TCR–CD3 entities through repetitive TOCCSL procedures on the 
same cell to enrich for slowly diffusing entities did not alter the results.
Photon antibunching/FCS experiments. All experiments were conducted on a 
customized setup equipped with a 635-nm pulsed diode laser (LDH-D-C-635, 
PicoQuant) featuring a pulse width below 100 ps and operated at 9.5 MHz for 
fluorescence excitation. The excitation beam was fed into the objective (HC PL 
APO 100× 
/1.40 oil CS2, Leica Microsystems) via an appropriate dichroic mirror 
(zt 625-745 rpc, Chroma) separating excitation from emission. The fluorescence 
was collected by the same objective, split into four identical channels by three 50:50 
beam splitters, each filtered by a band-pass filter (685/70 ET, Chroma), coupled into 
four multimode fibers and detected by four avalanche photodiodes (SPCMAQR-
13-FC, Perkin Elmer Optoelectronics). The fibers acted as confocal pinholes with 
a diameter of approximately 1 airy disc and were aligned to the focal excitation 
maximum. Data acquisition and analysis software were written in C+ 
+ and 
MATLAB (Mathworks). A three-axis piezo stage (TRITOR 102 CAP, Piezosystem) 
was used to raster scan the T cell plasma membrane in contact with the planar 
supported lipid bilayer and to find regions of interest for FCS measurements, which 
were controlled by a multifunction analog output computer card NI PCI-6731 
(National Instruments). Data acquisition relied on time-correlated single-photon 
counting in absolute timing mode with the use of a DPC-230 card (Becker & 
Hickl) and additional custom-made electronic cards allowing for the use of four 
or more independent detection channels. FCS antibunching experiments were 
conducted for 180 s with illumination power of 1 µ 
W at the back aperture of the 
objective. Control experiments involving soluble scFvs or Fabs in imaging buffer 
were performed for 30 min with an illumination power of 5 µ 
W at the back aperture 
of the objective. To block nonspecific scFv or Fab binding to the glass surface, the 
coverslips were blocked with biotinylated BSA (Sigma-Aldrich; 1 mg/ml in HBSS) 
for 10 min followed by a 5-min incubation step in imaging buffer.
FRET-based experiments. A microscope setup similar to that employed for TOCCSL-
based experiments was used with the following deviations: AF555 and AF568 were 
excited by a 532-nm solid-state laser (Millennia Pro, Spectra-Physics). Fluorescence 
emission was separated from excitation by a dichroic mirror (R405/488/532/635, 
Semrock), split into two color channels via a Dual View system (Photometrix) 
equipped with appropriate filter sets (640dcxr, HQ585/40 m, HQ700/75 m, Chroma) 
and detected with a back-illuminated EMCCD camera (iXon Ultra 897, Andor). 
For measuring ensemble FRET yields through FRET donor recovery after FRET 
acceptor photobleaching, a custom timing protocol was applied to record the following 
sequence: a 5-ms low-intensity (100 W/cm2) AF647 acquisition was followed by a 5-ms 
low-intensity AF555/AF568 acquisition (to monitor the AF555/AF568 signal before 
acceptor photobleaching), a 200-ms high-intensity 647-nm bleach pulse (5 kW/cm2; 
to ablate AF647), a second acquisition of AF555/AF568 (to monitor the FRET donor 
signal increase after acceptor bleaching) and finally a low-intensity AF647 acquisition 
(to verify AF647 ablation). Excitation was performed in TIR mode. For FRET analysis, 
the background-corrected average AF555/AF568 brightness of the entire contact area 
between the T cell and planar supported lipid bilayer, of synaptic TCR microclusters 
or of the central supramolecular activation cluster (cSMAC) was calculated before 
(Ibb) and after (Iab) acceptor ablation. The FRET efficiency was calculated by 
dividing the difference (Iab – Ibb) by Iab. To compensate for the possible movement 
of TCR microclusters during one FRET experiment, FRET yields were calculated 
by averaging the FRET yield of microclusters that were selected in the image before 
acceptor bleaching and microclusters that were selected in the image after acceptor 
bleaching. As a negative control, the FRET experiment was performed without 
acceptor bleaching, yielding the amount of photobleaching after two subsequent 
donor excitation pulses. For every experiment, the respective FRET efficiencies were 
corrected for photobleaching.
As shown in Supplementary Fig. 6g, inter-pMHC FRET yields within synaptic 
areas, which were not enriched for pMHCs (that is, areas with little or no pMHC 
binding), and inter-pMHC FRET yields measured outside the synapse were 
indistinguishable. However, when determined on a pixel-by-pixel level, different 
degrees of heterogeneity in FRET yields were observed outside and inside the 
synapse. These heterogeneities resulted from (i) temporal fluctuations in pMHC 
distribution on the lipid bilayer and (ii) the nature of the dequenching-based FRET 
quantification requiring the acquisition of two FRET donor images separated by 
a bleach pulse with a duration of 200 ms. pMHCs inside the synapse move more 
slowly owing to random interactions with the T cell’s glycocalyx, thereby reducing 
pixel-by-pixel heterogeneities in measured FRET yields. As a consequence, pixel-
by-pixel heterogeneities in inter-pMHC FRET were also found to be significantly 
reduced in synapses of mismatched OT-1 TCR-transgenic T cells confronted with 
planar supported lipid bilayers featuring I-Ek FRET probes, unlabeled B7-1 and 
ICAM-1 (Supplementary Fig. 6g).
Experiments involving the simultaneous visualization of synapse-recruited 
ZAP70-GFP were performed on a slightly modified TIRF microscopy setup, which 
included in addition to the system outlined above a third laser for excitation of 
GFP (Sapphire) and a triple-emission beam splitter for simultaneous recording 
of GFP, the FRET donor and the FRET acceptor channel (Optosplit III, CAIRN 
Research, equipped with BS640 (Semrock), zt532RDC (Chroma), HC510/20 
(Semrock), 570/60 (Chroma) and 675/50 (Chroma)). Settling of the T cells on the 
planar supported lipid bilayer was monitored in DIC. As soon as synaptic ZAP70 
recruitment became observable in TIRF via attenuated excitation at 488 nm, FRET 
yields were determined with the dequenching-based approach employing 532- and 
647-nm TIRF excitation as described above.
Anisotropy measurements. Anisotropy measurements were performed as 
described54. Briefly, polarized low-intensity light (~150 W/cm2) from 532-nm 
or 647-nm laser sources was used to excite the probes for 5 ms in non-TIR, 
epi-illumination configuration. After appropriate filtering (see “Microscopy—
TOCCSL”), the emission was split by a Wollaston prism into two polarization 
components, Ip and Is, and imaged on the same back-illuminated, liquid-nitrogen-
cooled CCD camera (see “Microscopy—TOCCSL”). To compensate for different 
detection efficiencies in the p- and s-polarized channels, the correction factor g was 
determined with a 1 µ 
M solution of AF555 (gAF555 = 0.87), AF568 (gAF568 = 0.62) and 
AF647 (gAF647 = 0.77) dyes placed on an anti-absorptive cover glass. Anisotropy was

TOCCSL and mobility analysis. TOCCSL experiments were analyzed as 
described26. Briefly, a MATLAB (Mathworks)-based maximum-likelihood 
estimator was used to determine position, integrated brightness B, full width 
at half-maximum (FWHM) and local background of individual signals in the 
TOCCSL images. A detailed description of the applied brightness analysis is 
provided in refs 25,56. The brightness values B of single AF647-scFv molecules 
pooled from the last images of all TOCCSL sequences were used to calculate the 
probability density function (pdf) of monomers, ρ1(B). Because of the independent 
photon emission process, the corresponding pdfs of N colocalized emitters can be 
calculated by a series of convolution integrals,

The brightness values from all TOCCSL images of multiple cells for one

. For all fits, no higher contributions than dimers (α2) were 
observed. A minimum of 250–500 brightness values27 was applied to calculate ρ1(B) 
and ρN(B). TCR surface densities from images obtained in standard fluorescence 
microscopy experiments were determined by dividing mean intensities/µ 
m2 by 
the average single-molecule brightness. To calculate the size of the mobile fraction 
by FRAP, TOCCSL sequences were applied on single cells several times. Mobile 
fraction sizes could then be estimated by measuring the relative recovery of 
fluorescence intensity in the pre-bleach image of consecutive experiments with 
delay times of 20 s. Single-molecule tracking was performed as described in57.  
A biexponential fit to the probability distribution of square displacements yielded 
the fraction of the mobile component, as described in more detail in ref. 58. Both 
methods yielded comparable values for the laterally mobile fraction (Fig. 1e). 
Mean-square displacement analysis of individual trajectories yielded a unimodal 
distribution of diffusion constants (Supplementary Fig. 1g).
A detailed description of the applied colocalization analysis performed for 
dual-color TOCCSL experiments is provided in ref. 29. For correcting chromatic 
aberrations, fluorescent multicolor beads (TetraSpeck, Life Sciences) were 
immobilized on glass slides and imaged under identical conditions as for dual-
color TOCCSL experiments. Positions of beads in both color channels were 
determined (Supplementary Fig. 2b) and used to calculate the relative shift and 
stretch of the two channels to each other. As a control, the algorithm was applied 
to determine the virtual distance of single beads in the corrected color channels 
(Supplementary Fig. 2b, right image). The average distance yielded about 20 
nanometers (Supplementary Fig. 2c, right panel), which can be attributed to the 
correction error of the method, as localization errors were in this case negligible 
(about 5 nm; Supplementary Fig. 2c, left and center panels). For dual-color 
TOCCSL data, detected positions were corrected and the virtual distances between 
AF488-scFv and AF647-scFv signals were determined. Signals within a distance 
of 200 nm were counted as colocalized, visually inspected and the total number of 
colocalization events, Nco-loc, for one experimental condition was normalized by the 
total number of signals, NscFv-AF488 and NscFv-AF647, yielding the average colocalization 
fraction.

�    Experimental design
1.   Sample size
Describe how sample size was determined.
Necessary sample sizes (number of analyzed single molecule signals) for  
TOCCSL experiments were taken from Brameshuber, M. & Schutz, G.J., Methods 
Enzymol 505, 159-186 (2012). The number of analyzed measurements was 
adjusted to give rise to a standard error of the mean, which supported the drawn 
conclusions. 
2.   Data exclusions

No data was excluded from the analysis.
3.   Replication
Describe whether the experimental findings were 
reliably reproduced.
All attempts at replication were successful.
4.   Randomization
Describe how samples/organisms/participants were 
allocated into experimental groups.
Allocating samples into experimental groups was not applicable since primary T 
cells from one mouse strain were used. No specific method for randomization was 
used.
5.   Blinding
Describe whether the investigators were blinded to 
group allocation during data collection and/or analysis.
Allocating samples into experimental groups was not applicable and hence blinding 
was not relevant to this study.
Note: all studies involving animals and/or human research participants must disclose whether blinding and randomization were used.

sample was measured repeatedly
A statement indicating how many times each experiment was replicated
The statistical test(s) used and whether they are one- or two-sided (note: only common tests should be described solely by name; more 
complex techniques should be described in the Methods section)
A description of any assumptions or corrections, such as an adjustment for multiple comparisons
