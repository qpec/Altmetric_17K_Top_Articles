Introduction: In 2015, an estimated 43.4 million Americans aged 18 and older suffered from a
behavioral health issue. Accurate estimates of the number of psychiatrists, psychologists, and
psychiatric nurse practitioners are needed as demand for behavioral health care grows.
Methods: The National Plan and Provider Enumeration System National Provider Identifier data
(October 2015) was used to examine the supply of psychiatrists, psychologists, and psychiatric nurse
practitioners. Providers were classified into three geographic categories based on their practicing
county (metropolitan, micropolitan, and non-core). Claritas 2014 U.S. population data were used to
calculate provider-to-population ratios for each provider type. Analysis was completed in 2016.
Results: Substantial variation exists across Census Divisions in the per capita supply of psychiatrists,
psychologists, and psychiatric nurse practitioners. The New England Census Division had the highest
per capita supply and the West South Central Census Division had among the lowest supply of all
three provider types. Nationally, the per capita supply of these providers was substantially lower in
non-metropolitan counties than in metropolitan counties, but Census Division disparities persisted
across geographic categories. There was a more than tenfold difference in the percentage of counties
lacking a psychiatrist between the New England Census Division (6%) and the West North Central
Census Division (69%). Higher percentages of non-metropolitan counties lacked a psychiatrist.
Conclusions: Psychiatrists, psychologists, and psychiatric nurse practitioners are unequally
distributed throughout the U.S. Disparities exist across Census Divisions and geographic categories.
Understanding this unequal distribution is necessary for developing approaches to improving access
to behavioral health services for underserved populations.

INTRODUCTION
I
n 2015, an estimated 43.4 million adults in the U.S,
nearly one fifth (17.9%) of those aged 18 and older,
suffered from a behavioral health issue—mental
illness, substance abuse, or other psychiatric condition.1
Almost one quarter of these (4.0%) suffered from a serious
mental illness, defined as any mental disorder that
substantially interfered with or limited one or more major
life activities. In 2014, medical expenditures for mental
health treatment in the U.S. were $179 billion,2 but the
total economic cost was much higher when indirect

 medical costs, such as higher emergency department costs,
higher prevalence of pulmonary disease, and early mortal-
ity are included.3 Lost productivity and earnings as well as
increased disability also contributed to the societal cost of
mental illness.4 Research indicates that early treatment of
mental disorders may help reduce the severity and length
of initial disorders and prevent subsequent disorders.5
These collective burdens of care compel an adequate
workforce to provide needed treatment. Strategies to
ensure an adequate workforce and access to mental health
care for all require current, accurate estimates of the
behavioral health provider supply, as more people are
insured and demand for behavioral health care grows.
Identifying where behavioral health shortages exist addi-
tionally requires estimates of population need. Algorithms
to estimate population need for prescribing and non-
prescribing behavioral health providers have been devel-
oped and widely used.6–9 Comparing regional and rural
−urban supply estimates to these benchmarks will identify
where the greatest disparities exist across the spectrum of
behavioral health providers.
In 2001, the Annapolis Coalition, a group of individ-
uals concerned about the behavioral health workforce
held a summit and identified workforce challenges and
potential solutions for improving the behavioral health
workforce. Strategic goals, developed by this group, to
improve the behavioral health system include: the
implementation of a research agenda to address the
dearth
of
behavioral
health
workforce
data
and
the development of the behavioral health workforce.10
The purpose of this study is to provide current national
estimates and comparisons of the availability of psychia-
trists, psychologists, and psychiatric nurse practitioners
(NPs) across Census Divisions and rural–urban areas.
This information is vital to guide the development and
implementation of strategies for improving treatment
access and for workforce development.
METHODS
The authors used the National Plan and Provider Enumeration
System National Provider Identifier (NPI) data (October 2015)11
to examine the supply of active psychiatrists, psychologists, and
psychiatric NPs with an individual NPI (Entity Type Code¼1).
The NPI supply of five types of behavioral health providers and
other workforce data sources were compared and it was deter-
mined that these three provider types had the most complete
representation in the NPI dataset, providing more accurate
estimates of supply.12–14 Social workers and counselors were the
other provider types that were considered but not included.
Estimates of the number of these behavioral health providers were
low in the NPI data when compared with other sources. This may
be because services provided by these practitioners can be billed
using another person’s NPI number or a practice’s NPI number.
Taxonomy codes for psychiatrists (Psychiatry and Neurology)
included: Addiction Medicine, Addiction Psychiatry, Behavioral
Neurology and Neuropsychiatry, Child and Adolescent Psychiatry,
Geriatric Psychiatry, Hospice and Palliative Medicine, Pain
Medicine, Psychiatry, Psychosomatic Medicine, and Sleep Medi-
cine. Taxonomy codes for psychologists included: Psychologist,
Addiction (Substance Use Disorder), Adult Development and
Aging, Clinical, Clinical Child and Adolescent, Cognitive and
Behavioral, Counseling, Educational, Family, Group Psychother-
apy, Health, Health Service, Mental Retardation and Devel-
opmental Disabilities, Prescribing (Medical), Psychoanalysis,
Psychotherapy, Rehabilitation, School, and Women. The taxon-
omy code for NPs was Psychiatric/Mental Health.
Providers whose practice addresses in the NPI file were not located
in the 50 states or District of Columbia were excluded (exclusions
included providers with addresses in U.S. territories and military
personnel stationed overseas). The county-level Federal Information
Processing Standard code for each provider was determined based
on their practice location’s ZIP code. The U.S. Department of
Agriculture Economic Research Service 2013 Urban Influence Codes
(UICs)15 were assigned to each provider based on their practice
county. UICs were used to classify all U.S. counties into one of three
geographic categories: metropolitan (UIC 1,2), micropolitan (UIC 3,
5, 8), and non-core (UIC 4, 6, 7, 9–12). UIC codes categorize counties
based on both a county’s largest urban population core and
adjacency to metropolitan areas. A UIC of 1 or 2 indicates a
metropolitan county with a large metro area and a small metro area,
respectively. UIC codes 3, 5, and 8 indicate a micropolitan county
that is adjacent to a large metro area, a small metro area, or neither,
respectively. Micropolitan counties have an urban core of 410,000
but o50,000 population. UIC codes 4, 6, 7, and 9–12 are called non-
core counties because they do not have a core-based population of
410,000. The county adjacency and size of the largest town
determines which of the non-core codes they are assigned.
Claritas 2014 U.S. population data16 were used to calculate
provider-to-population ratios for each provider type at the county
and Census Division levels for each geographic classification.
Descriptive analyses were completed in 2016 using IBM SPSS
software, version 24. The University of Washington IRB approved
this research.
RESULTS
Significant variation existed in both the percentage of
counties without a provider and in the provider-to-
population ratios when comparisons were made across
Census Divisions and counties of different rural classi-
fications. About one quarter (27%) of metropolitan
counties lacked a psychiatrist, compared with 65% of
non-metropolitan counties. About one fifth (19%) of
metropolitan counties lacked a psychologist, compared
with almost half (47%) of non-metropolitan counties.
And whereas about two fifths (42%) of metropolitan
counties lacked a psychiatric NP, this proportion nearly
doubled to 81% in non-metropolitan counties. Low
behavioral health provider supply was even more acute
in non-core counties: 80% lacked a psychiatrist; 61%
lacked a psychologist; and 91% lacked a psychiatric NP.

 Across Census Divisions, the differences in the per-
centage of counties without a provider were larger and
more striking. There was a more than tenfold difference
in the percentage of counties lacking a psychiatrist
between the New England Census Division (6%) and
the West North Central Census Division (69%; Table 1).
Among metropolitan counties only, the percentage of
counties lacking a psychiatrist was lower than that of
their respective Census Division. However, disparities
between Census Divisions persisted, as highlighted by the
13-fold difference between New England (3%) and both
West North Central (40%) and East South Central (40%).
In non-metropolitan counties (micropolitan and non-
core) in the New England Census Division, 9% lacked a
psychiatrist compared with 77% in the West North
Central and the West South Central Census Divisions.
Table 1 shows these percentages for micropolitan and
non-core counties separately.
Nationally, the per capita supply of psychiatrists,
psychologists, and psychiatric NPs was substantially
lower in non-metropolitan counties than in metropolitan
counties. There was approximately one third the supply
per 100,000 population of psychiatrists in non-metro-
politan (5.8; all supply ratios are expressed per 100,000
population) versus metropolitan counties (17.5). The
supply of psychologists in non-metropolitan counties
(13.7) was less than half the supply in metropolitan
counties (33.2), and similar disparities existed among
psychiatric NPs (1.6 vs 2.2). Non-core counties had the
lowest per capita supply. In these counties, the per
100,000 population supply of psychiatrists (3.4) and
psychologists (9.1) was less than one fourth of the supply
in metropolitan counties and about half the supply found
in micropolitan counties. The supply of psychiatric NPs
in non-core counties (0.9) was less than half the supply of
other counties.
There are even greater supply disparities across
Census Divisions (Figures 1–3). Table 1 shows substantial
variation across Census Division per capita supply for
each of the three provider types. The New England Census
Division had the highest per capita supply of psychiatrists,
psychologists, and psychiatric NPs across all geographic
categories. In metropolitan counties, the New England
Census Division had 36.0 psychiatrists per 100,000
population, more than three times that of the West South
Central Census Division (11.1). In micropolitan counties,
this supply disparity increased to more than a fivefold
difference for all three provider types. In non-core

 counties, the magnitude of differences in supply between
the New England Census Division and the Census
Divisions with the lowest supply were much larger and
ranged from 7.2 times as many psychologists to 15.0 times
the supply of psychiatric NPs per 100,000 population.
DISCUSSION
Addressing potential shortages of the behavioral health
workforce requires accurately enumerating the current
provider supply and some measure of patient need for
prescribing and nonprescribing providers. Using existing
benchmarks, estimates of the number of prescribing and
nonprescribing behavioral health providers needed per
100,000 adult population were calculated using the average
annual hours of care by an adult patient with any mental
illness and serious mental illness, and population preva-
lence estimates for serious mental illness and any mental
illness (excluding serious mental illness).1,6 The estimates
were 16.9 and 31.2 providers, respectively.
Psychiatrists and psychiatric NPs have a unique role as
prescribing providers in the behavioral health workforce.
In
2011,
more
than
26
million
adults
received
mental health treatment that included a prescription
medication.17 Metropolitan counties in five of the nine
Census Divisions had ratios above the prescribing
provider benchmark, but they varied greatly (from 41.7
per 100,000 population in the New England Census
Division to 17.1 in the South Atlantic Census Division).
Only micropolitan counties in the New England Census
Division reached the prescribing behavioral health pro-
vider benchmark. No Census Division had a prescribing
provider-to-population ratio at or above the benchmark
in their non-core counties, and all but the New England
and Middle Atlantic Divisions had a ratio that was about
one third or less of this benchmark ratio.
The four Census Divisions with the lowest supply of
psychiatric NPs (and prescribing behavioral health pro-
viders) were predominantly made up of states with
reduced or restricted scope of practice laws for NPs.18
Psychologists provide a range of traditional therapeu-
tic services as well as psychological assessments that only
they can provide, such as personality and learning
disability assessments. Benchmarks for nonprescribing
behavioral health providers have been estimated at 31.4
providers per 100,000 adult population, but without
reliable estimates of the supply of counselors and social
workers in the NPI data, comparisons to this benchmark

 are inappropriate. A comprehensive picture of the non-
prescribing behavioral health workforce will require
development of more complete data on these other
providers. However, understanding where nonprescrib-
ing provider shortages exist is crucial to ensure access to
care for all.
The findings presented here update, and are consistent
with, older county-level and single state−level assess-
ments that have reported widespread shortages and
substantial regional and urban−rural variation.19–23 The
prevalence of mental illness is similar across populations
residing in different Census Regions.24 National estimates
of the prevalence of past-year mental illness in 2015
ranged from 17.6% of adults in the Northeast Census
Region to 18.0% in the West Census Region. Rates of
serious mental illness ranged from 3.9% of adults in the
Northeast Census Region to 4.1% in both the Midwest
and West Census Regions. There was slightly more
variability across geographic categories, but the estimated
rates were still very similar. Past-year mental illness
prevalence ranged from 17.3% in large metropolitan
places to 18.3% overall in non-metropolitan counties.
Adult serious mental illness rates were 3.8% in large
metropolitan counties,
4.2% in small metropolitan
counties, and 4.7% in non-metropolitan counties. Because
the prevalence of mental illness is similar across popula-
tions residing in different regions and metropolitan
areas,24 the provider per 100,000 population ratios
presented here highlight a significant and persistent
geographic workforce maldistribution and not simply a
reflection of different levels of demand for services.
Findings from these analyses remind researchers that
the geography of rural−urban differences in provider
supply often occur in the context of an overall regional
geography of provider supply tied to regional variation in
history, economy, and demography. A substantial liter-
ature documents regional variation and disparities in
health care, and this study’s findings are consistent with
known patterns.25–28 The average supply of psychiatrists
per 100,000 population in micropolitan counties in the
New England Census Division (24.6) exceeded the supply
in metropolitan counties in all other Census Divisions
except the Middle Atlantic (25.8). The non-core supply
ratio in New England similarly exceeded the supply ratio
of micropolitan counties in all other Census Divisions.
In addition to behavioral health provider supply, the
New England Census Division differs from other Census
Divisions on a variety of measures. It has the largest

S204
 insured population, lowest poverty rate, low unemploy-
ment, and four of the six states in the New England
Census Division were ranked in the top ten healthiest
states.29–32 New England has the second highest physi-
cian-to-population ratio among Census Divisions, sug-
gesting that its high behavioral health supply ratio may
reflect an overall more robust health system.33 Distances
from non-metropolitan places in New England are closer
to large metropolitan areas because of smaller counties
and states than other Census Divisions. These attributes
and the fact that the New England Census Division is rich
in amenities, may explain some of the differences in the
behavioral health provider supply ratios seen, but more
research is needed.
Given these shortages, particularly in certain regions
and in most rural areas, innovative solutions must be
explored to provide behavioral health services to under-
served populations. Providing care using telehealth
technologies is a potential solution. As broadband access
in rural places and telehealth technologies improve,34 the
opportunity to provide services remotely will increase. In
rural communities where residents have heightened
concerns about stigma associated with seeking mental
health services, telehealth portals located in hospitals or
other healthcare facilities could address both infrastruc-
ture and confidentiality challenges.35,36 Integration of
mental health services into rural primary care settings
using telehealth has the potential to address both the lack
of capacity of the mental health workforce and the
geographic maldistribution of providers. Using evi-
dence-based models, such as telepsychiatry consultation
and collaborative care, has the potential to extend the
existing behavioral health workforce capacity and allow
access for underserved patients.37,38
Another approach to addressing shortages is the use of
behavioral health aides (BHA). Emerging models use
BHAs as care coordinators, community health workers,
behavioral health practitioners, or community health
aides.39 Other models employ BHAs to provide mental
health first aid, peer counseling, or support to traditional
behavioral health providers, extending their capabilities
in underserved places. Currently, BHAs are not included
on the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Service list of
behavioral health provider types eligible for payment,40
and BHA services are not typically covered by private
insurance. For telehealth behavioral health services, BHA
models, or other innovative behavioral health workforce
solutions to be viable, funding provisions must be
developed.
Limitations
This study has some limitations. The NPI dataset was
designed for administrative purposes, not for tracking the
health professional workforce. An NPI number is
required for billing the Centers for Medicare and
Medicaid Services, and therefore, certain providers, such
as psychiatrists, are likely better represented in the data
than those who may bill under another provider’s NPI or
a group or organization NPI. Providers who are not
actively practicing can still have an NPI number. In states
with reduced or restricted practice regulations,18 NPs
may be less likely to bill using their own NPI, which
could account for some of the differences in supply
shown here. Furthermore, these data do not allow for
investigation of the availability of services to underserved
populations provided via telehealth. Finally, the authors
did not include primary care providers (family and
internal medicine physicians, family NPs, and physician
assistants). Estimates suggest that 5% of the primary
diagnoses of a family physician’s adult visits are for a
mental health issue, and that 20% to 30% of all visits to
primary care physicians include some mental health
indicator, such as depression screening, counseling,
psychotherapy, a mental health diagnosis, or provision
of a psychotropic drug.41,42
The benchmark numbers for prescribing and non-
prescribing behavioral health providers per 100,000 adult
population do not include the care required to treat the
population younger than age 18 years. Additionally,
prevalence estimates for any serious mental health illness
do not include substance use disorders. This means that
the estimates of need used here are conservative and the
actual need is likely higher. Despite these limitations, the
comparisons to other data sources suggest that the NPI
data should provide a reasonably accurate picture of the
relative availability of these three provider types across
various geographic classifications.
CONCLUSIONS
Dramatic regional and rural−urban disparities exist
across the U.S. in the supply of psychiatrists, psycholo-
gists, and psychiatric nurse NPs. Understanding the
variability of the behavioral health provider supply and
the magnitude of these disparities is necessary for
developing targeted and realistic approaches to improv-
ing access to behavioral health services for underserved
populations.
