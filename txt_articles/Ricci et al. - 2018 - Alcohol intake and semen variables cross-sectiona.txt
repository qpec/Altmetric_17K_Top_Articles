SUMMARY
Background:
The association between alcohol intake and male reproductive function is still controversial. In the frame of a
prospective cohort study, designed to investigate the relation between life style and fertility, we performed a cross-sectional analysis
of semen quality.
Methods:
Men of subfertile couples, referring to an Italian Infertility Unit and eligible for assisted reproductive techniques (ARTs),
were asked about their lifestyle: BMI, smoking, caffeine intake, occupational and leisure physical activity (PA) and alcohol intake in
the last year before ART procedure. Semen volume, sperm concentration, total sperm count and sperm motility were determined.
Age, risk factors for impaired male fertility, caffeine, smoking, leisure PA, days of abstinence and daily calories intake were accounted
for in the analyses.
Results:
Between September 2014 and December 2016, we enrolled 323 male patients, mean age 39.3 years. Thirty-one (9.6%) were
abstainers, 97 (30.0%) drank <1–3, 98 (30.3%) 4–7 and 97 (30.0%) ≥8 alcohol units per week. As compared to men drinking <1–3 units
per week, median semen volume was higher in the 4–7 units/week group (3.0 mL, interquartile range, IQR, 2.0–4.0 vs. 2.4 mL, IQR
1.7–3.5), as well as total sperm count (87.9 mil/mL, IQR 20.2–182.1 vs. 51.5 mil/mL, IQR 15.2–114.7). Association with sperm concen-
tration was also significant, with a U-shaped trend in groups of alcohol intake. After adjusting for potential confounders, these rela-
tions were confirmed. Similar patterns were observed in subgroups of leisure PA and risk factors for impaired male fertility, although
these estimates often lacked statistical significance, presumably because of low sample size.
Conclusions:
Moderate alcohol intake appears positively associated to semen quality in male partners of infertile couples undergo-
ing ARTs.
INTRODUCTION
Approximately 15% of couples in their reproductive age is
affected by fertility problems and male factors seem to account
for up to 30% of cases (Nyboe Andersen et al., 2008; Thoma et al.,
2013). A comprehensive, evidence-based meta-analysis has
recently shown an overall 32% decline in sperm concentration in
European men over the past 50 years (Sengupta et al., 2017).
In most cases, the suboptimal semen quality is of idiopathic
origin, with no clear explanation for impaired spermatogenesis.
Although the causal link between environmental factors and
impaired male fertility is still weak, there is evidence suggesting
that semen quality may be influenced by environmental condi-
tions and lifestyle habits (Gabrielsen & Tanrikut, 2016); among
others, and besides the well-known genetic and endocrine fac-
tors (Visser & Repping, 2010; Ohlander et al., 2016), smoking,
overweight, physical activity, dietary factors and alcohol intake
have been suggested to play a role (Mendiola et al., 2009; Li
et al., 2011; Afeiche et al., 2013). However, evidence is not always
consistent.
A negative association between alcohol intake and semen
quality has been suggested by some authors (Martini et al., 2004;
Muthusami & Chinnaswamy, 2005), although other studies did
not confirm this finding (L�
opez Teij�
on et al., 2007; Hansen et al.,
2012). According to a recent meta-analysis of 15 cross-sectional
studies, occasional consumption does not adversely affect
semen variables, whereas a negative association with semen

 volume and normal morphology emerged for daily consumption
(Ricci et al., 2017). However, these findings could not be
controlled for confounders such as smoking and age.
To provide further information on this topic, we analysed data
from a study on the impact of lifestyle habits and diet on Assisted
Reproductive Techniques (ARTs) in Italian infertile couples
focusing on the relation between alcohol intake and semen
variables.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
From
September
2014 to December
2016, in randomly
selected days, subfertile couples, presenting for evaluation to the
Infertility Unit of Fondazione IRCCS Ca’ Granda, Ospedale Mag-
giore, Policlinico, Milan, and eligible for ART, were invited to
participate in an ongoing prospective cohort study on the role of
lifestyle habits and diet on ART outcome. The study protocol
was approved by the local Institutional Review Board. All proce-
dures were in accord with the Helsinki Declaration and all par-
ticipants provided written informed consent.
Study participation was proposed during the diagnostic phase.
Couples were interviewed on the day of oocyte retrieval. On the
same day, a semen sample was collected and analysed prior to
proceeding with in vitro fertilization (IVF) or intra-cytoplasmic
sperm injection (ICSI). The time interval between the proposal of
the study and the interview was generally less than one month.
Both partners of couples who agreed to participate were inter-
viewed by centrally trained personnel, using a standard ques-
tionnaire to obtain information on general socio-demographic
characteristics, personal and health history and habits (including
smoking, physical activity, alcohol intake and methylxanthine-
containing beverages consumption). Couples who do not speak
fluent Italian were excluded.
The present study reported exclusively on evidence obtained
from the male partner.
The overall participation rate was close to 95%. This high par-
ticipation rate was mainly due to the fact that couples were
interviewed during the period spent waiting for the different
diagnostic and therapeutic phases. Considering this time off and
the non-sensitive character questions, couples did not generally
refuse to participate.
Information on diet was obtained using a previously validated
food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) (Franceschi et al., 1993,
1995; Decarli et al., 1996). Patients were asked to report about
their usual weekly food consumption in the last year. The FFQ
includes the average weekly consumption of 78 food items or
food groups (such as the major sources of animal fats – i.e. red
meat, milk, cheese, ham, salami – folates, vitamins – vegetables
and fruit – pasta and bread consumption, cake, sweets and
chocolate, fish) and beverages. Intakes lower than once per
week, but at least once per month, were coded 0.5 per week. Sea-
sonal consumption was also considered (week consumption of
vegetables/fruits available in limited periods during the year,
weighted for months of consumption). Energy and mineral,
macro- and micronutrient intake was estimated using the most
recent update of an Italian food consumption database (Gnag-
narella et al., 2004).
Body mass index (BMI) was classified according to World
Health Organization (WHO) indications (WHO, Health Topics,
BMI
http://www.euro.who.int/en/health-topics/disease-preve
ntion/nutrition/a-healthy-lifestyle/body-mass-index-bmi).
Men were considered as having risk factors for impaired fertil-
ity, if they had a history of previous chemio- or radiotherapy, as
well as previous reproductive organ diseases, such as orchiec-
tomy, cryptorchidism and varicocoele. These data were retrieved
from clinical records.
Smoking habits were categorized as never, former or current,
and number of cigarettes smoked daily and duration of smoking
were recorded.
Caffeine intake from coffee (60 mg per cup), cappuccino
(75 mg per cup), tea (45 per cup), decaffeinated coffee (4 per
cup) and chocolate (6 mg/10 g) was calculated (Tavani, 2013).
Occupational physical activity (PA) was described as heavy (or
very heavy), light/moderate, mainly standing or mainly sitting.
Leisure PA was recorded in term of hours/week: <2, 2 to 4, ≥5. No
information was collected about intensity or type of leisure PA.
Calories intake was calculated by the FFQ (Franceschi et al.,
1993, 1995; Decarli et al., 1996).
Information on alcohol intake was collected as usual weekly
consumption (1 unit = 125 mL wine or 330 mL beer or 30 mL
spirits, all containing approximately 12.5 g of ethanol). An intake
lower than one unit per week was codified as 0.5.
Sperm analysis
Men were instructed to abstain from ejaculation for 2–5 days
before semen analysis and to report the specific time of absti-
nence. Semen samples were obtained by masturbation and col-
lected into a sterile plastic container provided and labeled with
the date and time of collection. All seminal fluid examinations
were carried out by the laboratory of the Unit, where samples
were maintained at room temperature until complete liquefac-
tion. Duration of complete liquefaction (<1 h) was documented,
until 1 h was reached. Semen analysis was performed with stan-
dardized methods according to the WHO guidelines (World
Health Organization 2010). The following variables were taken
into consideration: volume (mL), sperm concentration (sperma-
tozoa N/mL) and motility (%). Sperm motility was classified into
total (progressive + non-progressive motility) and progressive.
Total sperm count was calculated as volume 9 sperm concentra-
tion. As semen samples were collected specifically to carry out
ART procedures, sperm morphology was evaluated only in part-
ners of those couples undergoing IVF and after semen capacita-
tion (and not on rough samples).
The laboratory personnel was trained using the ESHRE Special
Interest Group in Andrology Basic Semen Analysis Course (Bar-
ratt et al., 2011).
Statistical procedures
Categorical or ordinal variables were described as frequency
(percentage,%), continuous variables as mean (standard devia-
tion, SD) if normally distributed and medians (interquartile
range, IQR) if not. Four domains of semen quality were assessed:
volume, concentration, total count and motility. At the univari-
ate analysis, groups were compared by means of Kruskal–Wallis
test, even if they were normally distributed.
In order to perform a multivariate analysis including potential
confounders,
non-normal
(skewed)
distributions
of
semen
parameters were square-root transformed and included in a gen-
eral linear model. Adjusted medians and 95% confidence interval
(CI) were calculated back-transforming the adjusted means and

CIs.

 confounders variables associated to alcohol intake or semen
quality at univariate analysis. Given that the relation between
alcohol intake and sperm parameters was potentially different in
men with or without risk factors for impaired fertility, we
planned to perform an analysis in strata for this variable. The
multivariate analysis also showed a significant relation between
sperm motility and leisure PA, therefore we also performed a fur-
ther analysis in strata for PA.
All reported p-values are based on two-sided tests and consid-
ered statistically significant if below 5%.
RESULTS
From September 2014 to December 2016, 327 men were
enrolled, aged 39.2 years on average (SD 5.2, range 27–60).
Among them, four did not provide complete information about
lifestyle and were excluded. The final analyses were conducted
in a sample of 323 men, aged 39.3 years on average (SD 5.3,
range 27–60).
The median daily alcohol intake was 8.30 g (IQR 2.72–15.95).
Excluding 31 men who did not drink at all, we determined ter-
tiles of daily alcohol intake: 0.01–5.44, 5.45–14.20 and ≥14.21 g
per day. Tertiles corresponded to a weekly consumption of <1–3,
4–7 and ≥8 alcohol units, respectively. In the last category, the
highest value of consumption was 108.13 g/day (60 units per
week), while the median alcohol consumption was 21.21 g/day
(about 12 units per week).
Patients’
characteristics
according
to
alcohol
intake
are
described in Table 1: alcohol intake was inversely associated
with age, and positively with caffeine consumption and calories
intake, although the highest caloric intake was observed in
abstainers. Never smokers were less frequently alcohol drinkers
than both former and current smokers.
Table 2 shows the median values of semen variables according
to demographic characteristics and lifestyle patterns. Alcohol
intake was associated to semen volume, sperm concentration
and total sperm count, with no dose-effect relation. Men drink-
ing 4–7 alcohol units per week had the highest semen volume.
The highest median concentrations were observed in abstainers
and in men drinking ≥8 units/week; total count was also associ-
ated to alcohol intake, but did not show a dose-dependent rela-
tion, although a significant rank correlation was observed
between these two variables (Spearman rho = 0.12, p = 0.038).
Days of abstinence were positively correlated to semen vol-
ume (Spearman rho = 0.14, p = 0.01) and inversely to sperm
motility (Spearman rho = �0.11), with borderline significance
(p = 0.07).
We accounted for the observed difference among men in
groups of alcohol intake using a general linear model equation,
that included age (associated to alcohol intake and semen vari-
ables), days of abstinence, leisure PA, risk factors for impaired
male fertility (associated with at least one semen variable),
smoking status, caffeine consumption, calories intake (associ-
ated with alcohol intake). Previous ART cycles did not relate to
alcohol intake nor to semen quality: therefore this variable was
not included in the final model. However, we also reran the
model including this information, without significant modifica-
tions in the results.
In the multivariate analysis, we still found a relation between
alcohol intake and semen volume, concentration and total count
(Table 3). Back-transforming semen volume, and using men with
<1–3 units per week of alcohol intake as the reference group, we
observed that men drinking 4–7 units/week had a significantly
higher median semen volume, that both men in 4–7 and ≥8
units/week group had significantly higher sperm concentration
(p = 0.047 and p = 0.004, respectively) and that abstainers had
higher median concentration as well (p = 0.017). Total count was
also associated to alcohol intake: men drinking 4–7 and ≥8 units/
week had higher total count than men drinking <1–3 units/week
(p = 0.006 and p = 0.009, respectively) but without dose-depen-
dent relation. No association emerged with sperm motility.
In the multivariate model, the presence of risk factors for
impaired male fertility was significantly associated to worse
sperm concentration (19.4 vs. 40.9 mil/mL, p < 0.0001), total
count (48.8 vs. 100.2 mil, p = 0.0002) and motility (29.3% vs.
39.6%, p < 0.0001). Leisure PA was related to sperm motility,
with the lowest motility in the intermediate level of PA: 31.3% in
men with 2–4 h per week vs. 37.0% in those with ≥5 h per week
(p = 0.012) of leisure PA.
A further analysis was performed, aiming at better under-
standing the role of alcohol intake in strata of impaired male fer-
tility and physical activity: medians and 95% CIs of sperm
variables are shown in Table 3, according to alcohol intake. Con-
sidering an alcohol intake of <1–3 units/week as the reference
category, we found that semen volume was significantly lower in
abstainers with low level of leisure PA; a trend of increasing vol-
ume with increasing alcohol intake, with a maximum at 4–7
units/week was consistently found in all strata.
Concentration and total sperm count increased with higher
level of alcohol intake in men without risk factors for impaired
fertility, and was significant both in those drinking 4–7 and ≥8
units per week. As regards leisure PA, no significant relation was
observed in men with ≥5 h/week, whereas in subject with <2
and 2–4 h/week concentration and total count were positively
related to alcohol intake, although no dose-relation was seen. As
in the overall analysis, alcohol intake was not associated with
sperm motility in any subgroups.
We checked terms for interactions between alcohol and, in
turn, smoking, PA, risk factors for male impaired fertility, age
class and caffeine intake. None of them was significant (data not
shown).
Lastly, we estimated the association between high alcohol
intake and semen quality, comparing 39 men who drank ≥14
units/week: in a model including the aforementioned variables,
no statistically or clinically significant association was observed,
both including and excluding non-drinkers from the analysis.
DISCUSSION
In this study, moderate alcohol intake appeared associated
with increased semen volume, sperm concentration and total
sperm count in the whole sample. A similar pattern was
observed in subgroups of leisure PA and risk factors for impaired
male fertility, although these estimates often lacked statistical
significance.
Considering that in our study both semen volume and sperm
concentration were positively associated to alcohol consump-
tion, total sperm count was positively related to alcohol intake as
well.
In our analysis, moderate alcohol intake relation with sperm
concentration and total count was significant in the entire
cohort, in men without risk factors for impaired fertility and in

 those with low and intermediate level of leisure PA. Actually, this
trend was observed in all subgroups considered in our analyses:
in
some cases,
differences
were not
significant,
probably
because of the small sample size of each group.
A study on 1221 young Danish men (Jensen et al., 2014) found
that sperm concentration and total sperm count were negatively
associated with increasing habitual alcohol intake. A case–con-
trol study (Muthusami & Chinnaswamy, 2005) concluded that
semen volume and sperm concentration were lower in alco-
holics compared with abstainers. However, in other studies alco-
hol did not seem to play any role. Considering the peculiar
group of men enrolled from Fertility Clinics, Martini et al. (2004)
and L�
opez Teij�
on et al. (2007) found no association, whereas
Goverde et al. (1995) reported that alcohol did not seem to be
associated with poor semen quality, although excessive alcohol
consumption
may
affect
an
already
suboptimal
sperm
morphology.
The inconsistency between our findings and previous studies
may be due to the different way of categorization of alcohol con-
sumption and to the different drinking habits of the populations
studied. For example, in Martini et al.’s study (Martini et al.,
2004), the comparison was performed between patients who
drank any quantity of alcohol and those who did not drink at all
in the past six months, therefore the effect of low and high alco-
hol intake (about 25% of drinkers included in the study con-
sumed more than 28 units/week) could not be discerned.
Men included in the study of Jensen et al. (2014) also had
higher levels of alcohol intake than subjects in our sample:
although the negative effects of alcohol intake were consistently
found at high doses (in men who drank more than 25

 units/week), sperm parameters of men with 0 and 1–5 units per
week were largely similar, if not better in the latter. In our sam-
ple, a relatively low alcohol intake was frequent: although 90% of
men reported some alcohol consumption, about one third drank
no more than 3 units per week and one third no more than 7
units/week. Therefore, the majority had levels of alcohol intake
similar to the lowest consumption category of Jensen et al.’s
study (Jensen et al., 2014).
A relation between alcohol drinking and semen parameter is
biologically plausible. It is known that beer and wine contain
polyphenols such as resveratrol or xanthohuminol, which were
demonstrated to have a strong therapeutic and cell protective
potential (Wogatzky et al., 2012; Cui et al., 2016). Accordingly, it
can be suggested that these compounds might stand behind the
observed beneficial effects found in this study. On the other
hand, different studies experimentally proved that alcohol has a
detrimental effect at all levels of the male reproductive system: it
interferes with the function of the hypothalamic-pituitary-testi-
cular axis, impairing gonadotropin secretion with consequent
decreasing of testosterone levels (Muthusami & Chinnaswamy,
2005; Maneesh et al., 2006). Likewise, the ratio between free
estradiol and free testosterone is modified by alcohol consump-
tion (Hansen et al., 2012). Studies on heavy alcohol intake

ALCOHOL DRINKING AND SPERM VARIABLES
ANDROLOGY
 related the low semen volume to the testosterone reduction due
to alcohol abuse, causing damage to Leydig cells or impairment
of hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis. Conversely, Jensen et al.
(2014) found increasing testosterone levels (total and free) with
increasing alcohol intake in young Danish men. With few excep-
tions, patients in our cohort had a moderate alcohol intake and
the detrimental effects, at these levels of consumption, might be
balanced by increasing testosterone levels and cell protective
potential of resveratrol or xanthohuminol. However, the mecha-
nisms underlying the positive association between moderate
alcohol intake and semen parameters, if true, are not easily com-
prehensible and need to be further investigated.
Some limitations and strengths of our study deserve to be
commented.
A first important limitation is that our findings should be
referred only to patients of infertile couples.
The information regarding alcohol use was self-reported, thus
some misclassification may have occurred. However, studies
investigating reproducibility and validity of self-reported alcohol
drinking (Flagg et al., 2000; Horn-Ross et al., 2008), in different
populations, found satisfactory correlation coefficients (at least
0.61). Furthermore, in Italy alcohol consumption is socially
accepted and recommendations to avoid alcohol for fertility
preservation are not routinely advocated during assisted repro-
duction procedures. On the contrary, underreporting of cigarette
consumption was possible, due to a lower social acceptability of
smoking (Gallus et al., 2011). However, an underreporting
should tend to reduce the estimated association between alcohol
and semen parameters.
Among the strengths of this study, we mention the relatively
large sample size, which is even more significant as this is a
single institution study. Men were interviewed in the same Insti-
tution by the same personnel, and participation was practically
complete. Moreover, we analysed the role of alcohol in men with
or without other conditions associated with infertility. We also
accounted for potential biases, such as age, smoking, BMI, calo-
ries intake, days of abstinence, that have been reported to be
associated with semen quality (Li et al., 2011).
In conclusion, in this cohort of male partners of subfertile cou-
ples undergoing ART cycles, alcohol intake was not negatively
associated with semen quality. In particular, higher semen vol-
ume was observed in men with 4–7 units/week of alcohol intake,
and ≥8 units/week were not negatively associated with other
seminal variables. Patients drinking 4–7 units per week also
showed a higher total sperm count in athe subgroup of men with
no risk factors for impaired fertility, and in those with 2–4 and
≥5 h/week of leisure physical activity.
Considering the high proportion of moderate drinkers included
in our population, we could not analyse the role of heavy or binge
drinking, which are consistently associated to detrimental effects
on semen quality. Considering that reassuring results of our study
were related to moderate intake, all men undergoing assisted
reproduction should be advised to limit alcohol consumption. As
this study has not addressed all concerns regarding the effect of
male drinking on reproduction and fertility, other domains of
reproductive outcomes need further investigation.
