SUMMARY
Tissue-resident memory T (Trm) cells form a hetero-
geneous population that provides localized protec-
tion against pathogens. Here, we identify CD49a
as a marker that differentiates CD8+ Trm cells on a
compartmental and functional basis. In human skin
epithelia, CD8+CD49a+ Trm cells produced inter-
feron-g, whereas CD8+CD49a� Trm cells produced
interleukin-17 (IL-17). In addition, CD8+CD49a+ Trm
cells from healthy skin rapidly induced the expression
of the effector molecules perforin and granzyme B
when stimulated with IL-15, thereby promoting a
strong cytotoxic response. In skin from patients with
vitiligo, where melanocytes are eradicated locally,
CD8+CD49a+ Trm cells that constitutively expressed
perforin and granzyme B accumulated both in the
epidermis and dermis. Conversely, CD8+CD49a– Trm
cells from psoriasis lesions predominantly generated
IL-17 responses that promote local inflammation in
this skin disease. Overall, CD49a expression delin-
eates CD8+ Trm cell specialization in human epithelial
barriers and correlates with the effector cell balance
found in distinct inflammatory skin diseases.
INTRODUCTION
The human skin forms a barrier to the external environment that
is constantly exposed to colonizing microbiota, invasive patho-
gens, and allergens (Belkaid and Segre, 2014; Pasparakis
et al., 2014). These encounters drive differentiation and coloniza-
tion of tissue-resident memory T (Trm) cells (Gaide et al., 2015;
Gebhardt et al., 2009; Naik et al., 2015; Naik et al., 2012), origi-
nally characterized in barrier tissues such as skin, gut, lung,
and the female genital tract (Gaide et al., 2015; Schenkel and
Masopust, 2014; Thome et al., 2014; Watanabe et al., 2015).
Of the 20 billion T cells contained in human skin (Clark et al.,
2006), 50%–70% express the Trm cell markers CD103 (a-sub-
unit of the aEb7 integrin receptor) and CD69 (Watanabe et al.,
2015), both implicated in lodging Trm cells in peripheral tissues.
CD103 binds E-cadherin, which is highly expressed on epithelia,
whereas CD69 antagonizes sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor 1
(S1PR1)-mediated egress from tissues (Mackay et al., 2015;
Skon et al., 2013).
Following in situ activation, Trm cells provide strong defense
against recurrent infections (Ariotti et al., 2014; Schenkel et al.,
2014). While such local immune responses contribute to immu-
nity (Gebhardt et al., 2009; Glennie et al., 2015; Jiang et al.,
2012; Naik et al., 2012), aberrant activation might cause disease
(Hondowicz et al., 2016; Jabri and Abadie, 2015; Park and
Kupper, 2015). In the skin, the patchy appearance of several
T
cell-mediated
diseases,
such
as
psoriasis
and
vitiligo
(Boehncke and Scho
¨ n, 2015; Ezzedine et al., 2015), suggests
that tissue-resident rather than circulating cells drive immunopa-
thology (Cheuk et al., 2014; Gaide et al., 2015; Kirsch et al.,
2015). Demarcated, inflamed and hyperproliferative plaques
are maintained by interleukin-23 (IL-23) and IL-17 in psoriasis
(Hueber et al., 2010; Leonardi et al., 2008), whereas vitiligo pre-
sents with persistent depigmentations attributed to local inter-
feron-g (IFN-g) production and T cell-mediated killing of melano-
cytes (Harris et al., 2012; Rashighi et al., 2014; van den Boorn
et al., 2009). Thus, if Trm cells drive these diseases, then vitiligo
and psoriasis would be expected to involve the contribution of
functionally different subsets.
Trm cell subsets with distinct cytokine profiles have been
reported in skin (Naik et al., 2015; Sanchez Rodriguez et al.,
2014; Watanabe et al., 2015), possibly reflecting a diversity
of immune functionalities and responses to pathogenic and
commensal microbiota. Nonetheless, phenotypic markers of

 Trm cell subsets with specialized effector functions have not
been established. In addition to CD103 and CD69, murine Trm
cells that create local immunity to recurrent viral infection homo-
genously express CD49a (Gebhardt et al., 2009; Ray et al., 2004;
Zhang and Bevan, 2013). CD49a constitutes the a-subunit of the
a1b1 integrin receptor, also known as very late antigen 1 (VLA-1),
and binds collagen IV enriched in the basement membrane
separating epidermis and dermis. As only 15% of human skin-
derived T cells express CD49a (Purwar et al., 2011), CD49a
expression might distinguish Trm cell subsets with distinct
effector functions and putative roles in immunopathology.
Here, we determined the anatomical localization, transcrip-
tional profiles, and functional properties of Trm cell subsets in
human skin with respect to CD49a, CD69, and CD103. In healthy
individuals, CD8+CD103+CD49a– Trm cells were present in
both the dermis and epidermis, whereas CD8+CD103+CD49a+
Trm cells specifically localized to the epidermis. Epidermal
CD8+CD103+CD49a– Trm cells were the predominant IL-17-
producers, whereas CD8+CD103+CD49a+ Trm cells excelled at
IFN-g production and rapidly gained a cytotoxic capacity
following IL-15 stimulation. This functional dichotomy was
evident in the comparison of distinct immune-mediated skin
diseases, with skin biopsies from vitiligo patients showing a pre-
dominance of cytotoxic CD8+CD103+CD49a+ Trm cells while
skin biopsies from psoriasis patients featured the accumulation
of the IL-17 producing CD8+CD103+CD49a– counterparts.
Together, our results reveal a functional specialization of distinct
skin Trm cell subsets in health and disease.
RESULTS
CD49a Expression Marks Epidermal, Oligoclonal
CD8+CD103+ Trm Cells
To gain insights into the diversity among Trm cells with respect
to spatial niches, we determined the relative expression of tis-
sue-residency markers CD69, CD103, and CD49a on CD4+
and CD8+ T cells from healthy human skin (Figure S1A).
Compared to the dermis, an increased proportion of epidermal
CD4+ and CD8+ T cells co-expressed CD69 and CD103 (Figures
1A and 1B) as previously reported (Watanabe et al., 2015). In
these healthy skin samples, CD49a expression was restricted
to CD8+CD69+CD103+ T cells that were located in the epidermis
(Figures 1A and 1C). Considerable variation in the frequencies
of CD8+CD69+CD103+CD49a+ T cells was apparent among
(Figure 1C) and within different donors (Figures S1B and S1C),
indicating high inter- and intra-individual variation of Trm cell
compositions within the epidermal compartment.
Skin CD4+ Trm cells were predominately CD62L–CD45RA–
CD28+, whereas CD8+ Trm cells were CD62L– but heteroge-
neous with respect
to expression
of CD27, CD28, and
CD45RA (Figures S1D and S1E). To delineate the microanatom-
ical localization of skin CD8+ T cell subsets, we performed
confocal imaging of healthy skin. Regardless of CD49a expres-
sion, epidermal CD8+ T cells were juxtaposed to the collagen
IV-rich basement membrane, embedded among basal keratino-
cytes (Figures 1D and 1E). Perivascular dermal CD8+ T cells
were predominately detected in papillary dermis well separated
from epidermis (Figure 1D). In total, 24% (6/33) of epidermal
and 6% (3/53) of dermal CD8+ T cells expressed CD49a in
direct contact with the basement membrane (Figure 1E; data
not shown).
Bulk T cells in full thickness human skin display a diverse T cell
receptor (TCR) repertoire that is in equilibrium with that of circu-
lating T cells (Clark et al., 2006; Harden et al., 2015). To deter-
mine whether epidermal CD8+CD103+CD49a+ Trm cells shared
a clonal origin with circulating effector memory CD8+ T cells or
skin T cell subsets, CD8+ T cell subsets from five healthy donors
were sorted (Figures S1F and S1G) and analyzed by targeted,
deep, high-throughput genomic DNA sequencing of the TCRb
complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3). A single Vb
family dominated the epidermal CD8+CD103+CD49a+ Trm cell
population in three donors, with CDR3 diversity more restricted
in CD8+CD103+CD49a+ versus CD8+CD103+CD49a– Trm cells
(Figures 1F and 1G). Although only a small proportion of the
detected clonotypes overlapped between epidermal CD8+
CD103+CD49a+ and CD8+CD103+CD49a– Trm cells (Figure 1H),
a few dominant clones were shared and comprised the majority
of total reads in two donors (Figures 1H and 1I). Furthermore,
whereas the most prevalent CD8+CD103+CD49a– Trm clono-
types showed some overlap with other epidermal and dermal
CD8+ T cell subsets (Figure 1J), Vb family distribution differed
in epidermal and dermal CD8+CD103+CD49a– Trm cells (Fig-
ure 1F). The ten largest CD8+CD103+CD49a+ Trm cell clones
were highly enriched in the epidermis (Figure 1J). Although the
mechanical procedure of dermal and epidermal preparations
might result in some degree of cellular cross-contamination,
these results together demonstrate the epidermal localization
of expanded, oligoclonal CD8+CD103+CD49a+ Trm cells in
human skin.

To further interrogate the functional properties of epidermal
CD8+CD103+CD49a– and CD8+CD103+CD49a+ Trm cell popu-
lations, we determined their transcriptional profiles, along with

T cells as well as peripheral blood CD8+CD62L–CD45RA– T cell

 populations expressing or lacking the cutaneous leukocyte anti-
gen (CLA). Cells were sorted from healthy donors (Figures S1F
and S1G) and analyzed by RNA-sequencing (Ramsko
¨ ld et al.,
2012). Principal component analysis on all sorted T cells subsets
from six donors distinguished circulating and skin T cell popula-
tions (Figure 2A). Among skin T cells, principal component anal-
ysis discriminated epidermal CD8+CD103+CD49a– and CD8+
CD103+CD49a+ Trm cells from dermal populations (Figure 2B).
Focusing on the epidermal Trm cells, 92 genes were differentially
expressed between CD8+CD103+CD49a– and CD8+CD103+
CD49a+ Trm cells (Figure 2C, Tables S1 and S2). Gene enrich-
ment analysis (DAVID) indicated acquisition of cytotoxicity-
related function as the most compelling difference between
the populations (Figure 2D). Specifically, expression of PRF1,
GZMB, GZMH, GZMK, GNLY, and NKG7 transcripts, all encod-
ing cytotoxic granule components, were elevated in epidermal
CD8+CD103+CD49a+ Trm cells (Figure 2E), indicating that this
subset might mediate cellular cytotoxicity. Moreover, genes
mediating response to viruses, lymphocyte activation, and
chemotaxis were also upregulated in CD8+CD103+CD49a+ Trm
cells (Figure 2D). Conversely, gene enrichment analyses did
not identify any significantly downregulated gene programs
(Figure 2D). Nonetheless, transcripts of genes associated with
IL-17 production, such as IL17F, RORC, IL23R, and CCR6,
were significantly decreased in CD8+CD103+CD49a+ relative to
CD8+CD103+CD49a– Trm cells, whereas transcripts for IFN-g
were elevated (Figures 2D-E). Transcription of ITGA1, encoding
CD49a, was not significantly different following correction
for multiple comparisons (uncorrected p = 0.0007, adjusted
p = 0.12). Quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis demonstrated
significantly higher ITGA1 transcription in CD8+CD103+CD49a+
versus CD8+CD103+CD49a– Trm cell subsets (Figure 2F;
p = 0.002). Moreover, regulation of GZMB, IFNG, and CCR6
was confirmed by qPCR, whereas no difference in ITGAE,
encoding CD103, was found (Figure 2F). Further validating tran-
scriptional data, CXCR3 expression was higher on CD8+CD103+
CD49a+ Trm cells, whereas IL-23R and CCR6 were preferentially
expressed by CD8+CD103+CD49a– Trm cells (Figure 2G). As
such, transcriptional profiles as well as surface receptor expres-
sion suggested functional differences between CD8+CD103+
CD49a– and CD8+CD103+CD49a+ Trm cells.
IL-2 and IL-15 Induce Cytotoxic Effector Protein
Expression in Epidermal CD8+CD103+CD49a+ Trm Cells
Despite enrichment of transcripts for cytotoxic granule con-
stituents in epidermal CD8+CD103+CD49a+ Trm cells, perforin,
and granzyme B protein expression was virtually undetectable
when examined ex vivo (Figures 3A and S2A and S2B). We
reasoned that in situ inflammatory stimuli might be required to
elicit expression of cytotoxic granule constituents in Trm cell
subsets, as recently proposed for IL-15 (Jabri and Abadie,
2015). Following incubation of epidermal cell suspensions with
a variety of proinflammatory cytokines relevant to skin inflamma-
tion, intracellular protein expression of perforin and granzyme B
was detected in CD8+CD103+CD49a+ Trm cells following IL-2
and IL-15 stimulation (Figures 3A–3C). Granzyme B expression
was upregulated as early as 1 hr after IL-15 stimulation, whereas
perforin expression was detected at later time points (Figure 3D).
Antibody-mediated blockade of MHC class I did not diminish IL-
15-mediated granzyme B upregulation (data not shown) and
other inflammatory cytokines, including IL-1b, IL-6, IL-7, IL-12,
IL-23, and IFN-a, did not elicit expression of cytotoxic granule
constituents (Figure 3G). In an inflammatory milieu, several cyto-
kines might interact for induction of cytotoxic granule constituent
expression. Accordingly, IL-15-dependent expression of per-
forin and granzyme B was augmented by IL-6, but not other
cytokine combinations tested (Figures S2C–S2E). Differential
expression of IL-2 and IL-15 receptor components could have
explained the preferential responses of epidermal CD8+CD103+
CD49a+ Trm cells. However, the IL-2 receptor b and g chains
were expressed in both epidermal subsets (Figures S2F and
S2G). Thus, epidermal CD8+CD103+CD49a+ Trm cells appeared
quiescent in healthy skin, but IL-2 from activated immune cells or
IL-15 from keratinocytes (Loser et al., 2004) might prime their
cytotoxic potential.
CD49a Expression Broadly Identifies Trm Cells with
Cytotoxic Potential in Mucosa
Besides the skin, Trm cells are widely distributed in other barrier
tissues. To determine whether CD49a expression more broadly
defined Trm cells with a cytotoxic potential, we examined two
mucosal barriers, gut and cervix (Figure S3A). CD8+CD103+
CD69+CD49a+ Trm cells were abundant in these tissues, with
an overall higher frequency of CD49a+ T cells (Figure 4A). Unlike
skin, substantial proportions of CD8+CD49a+ T cells lacking
CD69 or CD103 expression were present in both gut and cervix
and a population of CD4+CD103+CD69+CD49a+ Trm cells
existed in cervical epithelium (Figure 4A). With respect to
expression of cytotoxic granule constituents, gut, and particu-
larly cervical Trm cells displayed higher basal expression of per-
forin and granzyme B relative to skin (Figures 3A–3C, 4B and
S3B). Perforin and granzyme B were more highly expressed in
CD8+CD103+CD69+CD49a+ compared to CD8+CD103+CD69+
CD49a– gut and cervical Trm cells, being further augmented by
T cell subpopulations. (C–E) Transcriptome analysis of CD8+CD103+CD49a– and CD8+CD103+CD49a+ Trm cells sorted from healthy epidermis (n = 7). (C) MA-

 IL-15 stimulation (Figure 4B). These results indicate that CD49a
expression defines Trm cell subsets with cytotoxic potential in
a variety of epithelial tissues.
IL-15 Activated Epidermal CD8+CD103+CD49a+ Trm
Cells Are Cytotoxic
Having found that CD49a generally identifies Trm cells with cyto-
toxic potential and having elucidated inflammatory signals for
their priming, we set out to determine their cytotoxic capacity.
Sorted T cell subsets from blood and skin collected from healthy
donors (Figure S4) were incubated with 51Cr-labeled target cells
in 4 hr redirected antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity as-
says. The cytotoxic activity of epidermal CD8+CD103+CD49a–
and CD8+CD103+CD49a+ Trm cell subsets was compared to
that of peripheral blood CD8+CD57+ T cells, a highly cytotoxic
effector memory subset (Chiang et al., 2013), as well as less
cytotoxic CD8+CD57– T cells, constituting naive and memory
subsets. CD8+CD57+ T cells displayed strong cytotoxic activity,
whereas skin-derived CD8+CD103+CD49a+ Trm cells mediated
very poor activity following anti-CD3 antibody stimulation (Fig-
ure 5A). However, following 48 hr of IL-15 pre-stimulation,
epidermal CD8+CD103+CD49a+ Trm cells manifested cytotoxic
activity comparable to that of peripheral blood CD8+CD57+
T cells, whereas CD8+CD103+CD49a– Trm cells and CD8+
CD57– T cells remained poor cytotoxic effectors (Figure 5A).
Stimulation of epidermal T cells with anti-CD3 antibodies for
24 hr induced similar levels of CD8+CD103+CD49a+ Trm cell
granzyme B and perforin expression as IL-15, whereas these
stimulations in combination displayed an additive effect (Fig-
ure 5B). In summary, skin-derived CD8+CD103+CD49a+ Trm
cells lack perforin expression, with short-term TCR stimulation
alone being insufficient to induce cytotoxicity. Rather, IL-15-
stimulation prompted strong TCR-dependent cellular cytotox-
icity by CD8+CD103+CD49a+ Trm cells.

 inflammatory keratinocyte responses. Prompted by differences
in transcription of IFNG as well as RORC, a key transcriptional
regulator of IL-17 production, we determined whether CD49a
expression also defined epidermal skin Trm cell subsets in re-
gards to cytokine production. Corroborating transcriptional
profiles, CD8+CD103+CD49a– Trm cells produced IL-17 while
CD8+CD103+CD49a+ Trm cells excelled in IFN-g production
upon stimulation with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and
ionomycin (Figures 6A–6C). Relative to the epidermal CD8+
CD103+CD49a–
Trm
cells,
dermal
counterparts
produced
3.5-fold less IL-17. TNF and IL-2 were abundantly produced
by dermal and epidermal Trm cell subsets (Figures 6B and
6C). TCR engagement using anti-CD3 antibodies also preferen-
tially induced IFN-g by epidermal CD8+CD103+CD49a+ Trm
cells (Figure 6D). Moreover, IL-15 stimulation potentiated
TCR-dependent expression of IL-17 and IFN-g by epidermal
CD8+CD103+CD49a– and IFN-g by CD8+CD103+CD49a+ Trm
cells, respectively (Figure 6D), substantiating effectual g chain
receptor signaling in both subsets. Coating of wells with
collagen IV in addition to anti-CD3 antibodies specifically
augmented production of IFN-g by epidermal CD8+CD103+
CD49a+ Trm cells (Figure 6E), indicating VLA-1-mediated
regulation of cytokine production. Unconventional mucosal-
associated invariant T (MAIT) cells represent a fraction of pe-
ripheral blood IL-17-producing T cells (Dusseaux et al., 2011).
Although up to 30% of skin CD8+ T cells expressed CD161,
CD8+TCR-Va7.2+CD161+
MAIT
cells
comprised
less
than
25% of dermal or epidermal skin CD8+ Trm cell populations
(Figures S5A and S5B) and made up less than 25% of the
IL-17-producing CD8+CD103+ T cells (Figures S5C and S5D).
Thus, CD49a expression delineated a dichotomy in Trm cell
cytokine production, augmented by IL-15, with CD8+CD103+
CD49a– and CD8+CD103+CD49a+ Trm cells preferentially pro-
ducing IL-17 and IFN-g, respectively.
Functional Specialization According to CD49
Expression Is Preserved in Distinct Focal Skin Diseases
A population of epithelial Trm cells that upon controlled activa-
tion perform cytotoxic killing and IFN-g production would be
perfectly placed to safeguard against infections and malignant
transformation in situ. Hypothetically, such specialized Trm cells
might also participate in focal immune pathology in vitiligo (Fig-
ure S6A), a disease where cytotoxic T cells have been implicated
in eradication of melanocytes. The proportion of epidermal
CD8+CD103+CD49a+ Trm cells was increased in lesional vitiligo
but not in psoriasis (Figures 7A and 7B). CD49a was expressed
on almost half of dermal CD8+CD103+ Trm cells in lesional vitiligo
(Figures 7A and 7B), adjacent to collagen IV-expressing vessels
(Figure S6B), while healthy skin, non-lesional vitiligo and psoria-
sis was devoid of this population (Figures 7A and 7B, S6C and

 S6D). In contrast, CD4+CD103+ T cells in lesional vitiligo did not
express CD49a (Figure S6E). In vitiligo, a substantial proportion
of lesional CD8+CD103+CD49a+ Trm cells recognized melano-
cyte-derived antigens (Figures S6F and S6G). Perforin and gran-
zyme B-expressing Trm cells were detected in vitiligo, but not
in healthy skin or psoriasis (Figures 7C and 7D). Moreover, CD8+
CD103+CD49a+ Trm cells co-expressed perforin and granzyme
B in lesional vitiligo ex vivo (Figures 7E and 7F). In line
with increased CD49a frequencies, IFN-g producing Trm cells
were enriched in vitiligo lesions (Figure 7G). Conversely, IL-17-
producing Trm cells were enriched in psoriasis plaques (Figure
7G).
As
in
skin
from
healthy
volunteers,
CD8+CD103+
CD49a+ Trm cells thus preferentially expressed IFN-g and CD8+
CD103+CD49a– Trm cells IL-17 in both vitiligo and psoriasis
(Figures 7H–7J). Similar to healthy skin and in agreement with
a previous study (Teunissen et al., 2014), less than 5% of skin
IL-17 producing cells were CD161highVa7.2+ MAIT cells (Figures
S6H–S6J). Trm cells with the capacity to co-express IFN-g and
IL-17 were present in psoriasis plaques (Figure 7H and 7J),
indicating a degree of functional plasticity in the context of
chronic inflammation. However, constrained plasticity of healthy
skin-derived Trm cells was indicated, as sorted CD8+CD103+
CD49a+ Trm cells from healthy skin failed to produce IL-17
following 72 hr of stimulation with IL-1, IL-6, and IL-23 (Figures
S6L and S6M). In resolved psoriasis, CD8+ Trm cells poised for
IL-17 production accumulate (Cheuk et al., 2014), and IL-17
expression was highly enriched within the CD8+CD103+CD49a–
Trm cell subset (Figure S6N). Thus, functional dichotomies
associated with CD49a expression were generally preserved in
disease-associated Trm cells arguing that CD49a marks subsets
of Trm cells with imprinted effector profiles and distinct functions
in inflammatory skin diseases.

DISCUSSION
At epithelial boundaries, Trm cells differen-
tiate and form a first line of adaptive defense
against multiple pathogens, tailored to effec-
tively control recurrent infections. Conse-
quently, it would be expected that distinct
subsets of Trm cells respond to activation
with
heterogeneous
cytokine
responses
(Naik et al., 2015; Sanchez Rodriguez et al., 2014; Schlapbach
et al., 2014; Watanabe et al., 2015) Despite their protective role
in recurrent viral infections, direct proof of Trm cell-mediated
cytotoxicity is lacking (Mueller and Mackay, 2016). In addition
to anti-microbial defense, pathogenic Trm cells are implicated
in several inflammatory diseases (Clark, 2015). Here, we identify
CD49a expression as a marker delineating a subpopulation
of CD8+ Trm cells in human skin that specifically localize to
the basal layer of epidermis, preferentially produce IFN-g, and
display high cytotoxic capacity upon stimulation. We also find a
high proportion of CD49a+ Trm cells poised for cellular cytotox-
icity in other epithelial tissues. Conversely, CD49a– Trm cells
excelled in IL-17 production. Lastly, we determined that this func-
tional dichotomy among Trm cell subsets was preserved in the in-
flammatory skin diseases psoriasis or vitiligo.
In healthy skin, we found CD49a+ Trm cells confined to basal
epidermis in contact with collagen IV expressed in the basement
membrane. Mouse epidermis displays analogous spatial restric-
tions to the number of Trm cells during homeostasis (Zaid et al.,
2014). Interactions with collagen IV might anchor CD49a+ Trm
cells in the epidermis. In murine models, protective CD8+CD49a+
Trm cells develop in barrier tissues (Gebhardt et al., 2009; Ray
et al., 2004; Zhang and Bevan, 2013) following viral infections.
In line with our study of human skin, granzyme B-expressing
Trm cells are retained in mouse epithelium following epidermo-
tropic viral infections (Gebhardt et al., 2009; Schenkel et al.,
2014). Epithelial tissues represent first sites of viral entry and
with high cellular turnover of keratinocytes, offer an attractive
niche for viral propagation and shedding. Thus, by expressing
CD49a, Trm cells seem well-positioned for immunosurveillance
of infected epithelial cells via production of IFN-g as well

 CD49a enhanced IFN-g production by CD8+CD103+CD49a+
Trm cells, possibly through stabilizing IFNG transcripts (Wang
et al., 2006). Similar to mouse CD8+ Trm cells in the context of
viral infection (Mackay et al., 2013; Wakim et al., 2013), the tran-
scriptional profiles of human CD8+CD103+CD49a+ Trm cells
suggested that anti-viral defense and target cell killing represent
key functions of this subset. Such cells might also contribute to
local surveillance and defense against malignancy (Jameson
et al., 2002).
Freshly isolated human skin CD8+CD103+CD49a+ Trm cells
displayed a transcriptional profile indicative of cytotoxic func-
tion, but did not express key mediators of cellular cytotoxicity.

 Rather, their cytotoxic capacity was primed through IL-2 and IL-
15-mediated induction of perforin and granzyme B expression.
IL-15 is essential for Trm development (Mackay et al., 2013)
and entry into the epidermis (Adachi et al., 2015). Here we
find that IL-15 additionally acts both to potentiate cytokine re-
sponses and as a key mediator in cytotoxic licensing of CD8+
CD103+CD49a+ Trm cell. Our results suggest an important role
for bystander keratinocytes or T cells in activation of Trm cell-
mediated effector functions within the skin. These observations
validate the hypothesis that IL-15 might generally act as a central
danger signal regulating Trm cell responses (Jabri and Abadie,
2015) and extend knowledge by providing a cellular marker
of specific Trm cell subsets capable of mediating cellular cyto-
toxicity. In the gut, IL-15 is implicated in driving cytotoxic

 lymphocyte responses that turn pathological in celiac disease
(Meresse et al., 2004). In our analyses, CD49a was abundantly
expressed on CD8+ Trm cells in gut and cervix, representing
mucosal barrier tissues. In these tissues, a greater proportion
of Trm cells expressed CD49a than in skin and displayed a
more activated phenotype, with constitutive expression of per-
forin and granzyme B. It is possible that mucosa is a milieu
more commonly challenged by pathogens, requiring activated,
cytotoxic CD49a+ Trm cells that provide continuous surveillance.
Nonetheless, IL-15-mediated potentiation of CD49a+ Trm cells
might represent a mechanism to safeguard tissues against
immunopathology.
Revealing functional specialization among epidermal Trm cells
with respect to CD49a expression, CD8+CD103+CD49a– Trm
cells preferentially produced IL-17, a cytokine required for con-
trol of bacterial and fungal infections. Epidermal CD8+CD103+
CD49a– Trm cells excelled in IL-17 production relative to
dermal counterparts as well as dermal CD8+CD103– T cells.
This observation, combined with different gene-expression
profiles, indicates distinct subsets of CD8+CD103+CD49a– Trm
in dermis versus epidermis. To explore potential origins of
epidermal CD8+CD103+CD49a+ Trm cells, we sorted dermal
CD8+CD103– Trm cells and stimulated them with IL-15 and
TGF-b, cytokines implicated in Trm cell differentiation (Mackay
et al., 2013; Watanabe et al., 2015). A fraction of dermal
CD8+CD103– Trm cells upregulated both CD103 and CD49a
following stimulation (S.C. and L.E., unpublished observations),
indicating that inflammatory responses might differentiate
dermal T cells to functionally distinct Trm cells embedded in
epidermis. Animal models provide further opportunities to
dissect the molecular requirements for induction of CD49a and
determine the role of CD49a in ensuring effective Trm cell-medi-
ated immunity.
The patchy appearance and fixed recurrence of several
inflammatory skin diseases implies the activity of Trm cells. In
vitiligo, activated CD8+CD103+CD49a+ Trm cells expressing
cytotoxic granule constituents accumulated and penetrated
into the dermis. There, they are well-positioned to eradicate
repopulating melanocytes. In contrast, in active psoriasis, with
up to 100-fold more Trm cells within the hypertrophic epidermis
compared to healthy skin (Cheuk et al., 2014), IL-17-producing
Trm cells were profoundly expanded. Moreover, IL-17 or IFN-g
production by distinct Trm cells subsets was generally main-
tained even in the context of the vigorous tissue inflammation.
Co-expression of IL-17 and IFN-g was detected in some CD8+
CD103+CD49a– and CD8+CD103+CD49a+ Trm cells. However,
we could not induce IL-17 production by CD8+CD103+CD49a+
Trm cells sorted from healthy skin following IL-23, IL-6, and
IL-1b stimulation. Thus, we speculate that during differentiation
Trm cells require TCR engagement in addition to IL-17 polarizing
inflammatory cues to display the level of functional plasticity we
observe in psoriasis. In resolved psoriasis where numbers of
Trm cells are similar to healthy skin, we previously described
enrichment of CD8+CD103+CCR6+IL-23R+ Trm cells poised to
IL-17 production (Cheuk et al., 2014). Congruently, preferential
expression of IL-17 by CD8+CD103+CD49a– Trm cells was
apparent. In contrast, IFN-g-producing CD8+CD103+CD49a+
Trm cells were enriched in vitiligo, further supporting the notion
of a dichotomy of Trm cell subsets according to CD49a expres-
sion even in the setting of skin inflammation and immunopa-
thology (Figure S6O).
Given the role of IL-2 and IL-15 in potentiating both IL-17 and
cytotoxic effector functions in Trm cells, blockade of the down-
stream JAK/STAT pathway represents a promising therapeutic
target for skin diseases putatively caused by aberrant Trm cell
activation. Interestingly, a case report suggests clinical efficacy
of toficitinib, a small molecule inhibitor of JAK1 and JAK3, on
vitiligo (Craiglow and King, 2015). Systemic administration of
IL-15Rb blocking antibodies prevented hair loss in a mouse
model of alopecia areata (Xing et al., 2014), a disease character-
ized by aberrant killing of hair follicles. Most patients present
with limited burden of disease that cause considerable suffering,
yet do not require systemic treatment. Future development of
topical treatments aiming at controlling pathogenic Trm cells
in situ would offer an attractive therapeutic strategy, with our
data highlighting g chain signaling an attractive target.
In summary, our data reveal that human skin contains different
subset of epidermal Trm cells poised toward cytotoxicity and
IFN-g or IL-17 production, respectively. Inflammatory cytokines
unleashed TCR engagement-dependent cellular cytotoxicity by
CD49a+ Trm cells from healthy skin, whereas activated, perforin-
and granzyme-expressing CD49a+ Trm cells accumulated
in vitiligo lesions. Conversely, CD49a– Trm cells accounted for
the augmented IL-17 production in lesional psoriasis. Further in-
sights into the dynamics of the composition, retention, and acti-
vation of expanded, functionally specialized Trm cell populations
might contribute to improved management of both infections
and chronic inflammatory skin diseases.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Tissue Samples
Human peripheral blood and healthy skin samples from trunk were obtained
from reconstructive skin surgery at AdVita Clinic, Stockholm, Sweden, and
Karolinska University Hospital, Solna. Cervical tissue samples were obtained
from non-malignant and non-inflammatory surgical specimens, St. Go
¨ ran
Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden. Gut biopsies were obtained from the ileum of
healthy patients with hereditary predisposition for colorectal cancer (Lynch
syndrome) at Karolinska University Hospital, Huddinge. Patients with non-
segmental vitiligo, or plaque psoriasis were collected at the Swedish Psoriasis
Association Clinic or the dermatology clinic at Karolinska University Hospital,
Solna (Table S3). Resolved psoriasis was collected as previously described
(Cheuk et al., 2014). Lesional vitiligo biopsies were sampled from within
1 cm to and non-lesional at least 10 cm away from lesional borders. All tissue
samples were collected according to the Declaration of Helsinki with signed
consent. Ethical permits 2012/50-31/2, 2015/0041-31, 2015/933-32, 2012/
1900-31/1, 2013/1800-32, 2015/1078-32, regional ethical committee of
Stockholm.
Confocal Microscopy
Skin biopsies were cryopreserved at �80�C. 8–10 mm thick sections were
stained as previously described (Cheuk et al., 2014) with primary antibodies
to collagen IV (clone COL-94, Abcam), MelanA (clone EP1422Y, Abcam), ker-
atin 5/6 (cloneD516, DAKO), CD8 (AB4055, AbCAM), CD49a (clone 550594,
BD Bioscience), and CD3 (clone CD3-12, Abcam). Images were acquired by
Zeiss LSM700 and LSM800 (Zeiss) and analyzed with Fiji-ImageJ.
Cell Suspension and Culture
Whole-skin punch biopsies and cervix samples were incubated in 5U dis-
pase (Life Technologies) overnight at 4�C followed by manual separation
of epidermis and cervical epithelium from dermis or cervical submuocsa
respectively followed by 90 min incubation in collagenase III (3 mg/ml;
Immunity 46, 287–300, February 21, 2017

 Worthington) with DNase (5 mg/ml; Roche) in RPMI 1640. Epidermal cell sus-
pension was prepared by repeated pipetting. Dermis and submucosa were
further processed by Medicon tissue disruptor (BD Biosciences) as previ-
ously described (Cheuk et al., 2014). Ileum biopsies were digested in colla-
genase II (0.25 mg/ml; Sigma-Aldrich) with DNase (0.2 mg/ml; Roche) in
IMDM (Life Technologies) for 30–45 min. Complete RPMI medium was added
and the cell suspension were subsequently passed through a 40 mm (gut) /
70 mm (skin or cervix) cell strainer (BD Bioscience). Peripheral blood mono-
nuclear cells (PBMCs) were prepared by Ficoll (GE Healthcare) density
separation.
P815 cells were purchased from ATCC and maintained in complete medium
(RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum [FBS], L-glutamine; all
Hyclone). Recombinant IL-15, IL-1b, IL-2, IL-6, IL-7, IL-23, IL-12 and IFN-a (all
R&D Systems) were stored at �80�C. Human collagen IV, phorbol 12-myris-
tate 13-acetate (PMA), and ionomycin were purchased from Sigma.
Flow Cytometry and Cell Sorting of Tissue-Derived Cells
Fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies are specified in the Table S4. Freshly
isolated cell suspensions were stained and kept on ice before sorting. Sort-
ing was performed within 2-4 hr using MoFlo XDP (Beckman Coulter) cell
sorter or BD FACZJAZZ (BD). The purity of sorted cells was at least 90%.
Sorted cells were maintained in complete medium overnight before further
experiment. Details on flow cytometry and sorting experiments, as well
as functional evaluations are provided in the Supplemental Experimental
Procedures.
DNA Extraction and TCR Sequencing
DNA was extracted (Puregene, QIAGEN) and the TCR-b CDR3 regions were
sequenced and mapped (ImmunoSEQ, Adaptive Biotech). Data from produc-
tive reads were extracted from ImmunoSEQ platform for further analysis. Raw
data were uploaded on the immuneACCESS platform provided by Adaptive-
Biotech (doi.org/10.21417/B76K56). Details on TCR clonality analysis are pro-
vided in the Supplemental Procedures.
RNA Extraction and Transcriptome Analyses
RNA was purified from cell-qiazol lysate (miRNeasy, QIAGEN) and quality was
checked (Bioanalyzer RNA 6000, Agilent) before library construction (SMART-
Seq, ClonTech) and sequencing (Illumina HiSeqTM 2000). Data were analyzed
as detailed in the Supplemental Experimental Procedures.
Cytotoxicity Assay
The cytotoxicity assay was performed and analyzed as described previously
(Chiang et al., 2013). In brief, sorted and rested cell populations were used
as effector cells against
51Cr-labeled P815 target cells supplemented
with 0.5 mg/ml of anti-CD3 antibody (clone S4.1, Invitrogen) with effector-to-
target ratios between 10 and 0.3. Samples were run in duplicates for 4 hr at
37�C. 51Cr release in supernatant was measured on a g-counter (Wizard2,
PerkinElmer) and specific lysis was calculated as previously described (Chiang
et al., 2013).
Statistics and Graphics
Statistical analysis and graphical illustration of numerical data was performed
by using either PRISM (v6, GraphPad), JMP 13 or RStudio. SPICE charts
were generated by SPICE (https://exon.niaid.nih.gov/spice/). Heatmaps
were generated by MeV: MultiExperiment Viewer (http://mev.tm4.org/).
