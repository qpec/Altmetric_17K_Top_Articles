Background
The burden of coronary heart disease (CHD) worldwide is one of great concern to patients and healthcare agencies alike. Exercise-
based cardiac rehabilitation aims to restore patients with heart disease to health.
Objectives
To determine the effectiveness of exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation (exercise training alone or in combination with psychosocial or
educational interventions) on mortality, morbidity and health-related quality of life of patients with CHD.
Search methods
RCTs have been identified by searching CENTRAL, HTA, and DARE (using The Cochrane Library Issue 4, 2009), as well as MEDLINE
(1950 to December 2009), EMBASE (1980 to December 2009), CINAHL (1982 to December 2009), and Science Citation Index
Expanded (1900 to December 2009).
Selection criteria
Men and women of all ages who have had myocardial infarction (MI), coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) or percutaneous transluminal
coronary angioplasty (PTCA), or who have angina pectoris or coronary artery disease defined by angiography.
Data collection and analysis
Studies were selected and data extracted independently by two reviewers. Authors were contacted where possible to obtain missing
information.

 Main results
This systematic review has allowed analysis of 47 studies randomising 10,794 patients to exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation or
usual care. In medium to longer term (i.e. 12 or more months follow-up) exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation reduced overall and
cardiovascular mortality [RR 0.87 (95% CI 0.75, 0.99) and 0.74 (95% CI 0.63, 0.87), respectively], and hospital admissions [RR 0.69
(95% CI 0.51, 0.93)] in the shorter term (< 12 months follow-up) with no evidence of heterogeneity of effect across trials. Cardiac
rehabilitation did not reduce the risk of total MI, CABG or PTCA. Given both the heterogeneity in outcome measures and methods
of reporting findings, a meta-analysis was not undertaken for health-related quality of life. In seven out of 10 trials reporting health-
related quality of life using validated measures was there evidence of a significantly higher level of quality of life with exercise-based
cardiac rehabilitation than usual care.
Authors’ conclusions
Exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation is effective in reducing total and cardiovascular mortality (in medium to longer term studies)
and hospital admissions (in shorter term studies) but not total MI or revascularisation (CABG or PTCA). Despite inclusion of more
recent trials, the population studied in this review is still predominantly male, middle aged and low risk. Therefore, well-designed, and
adequately reported RCTs in groups of CHD patients more representative of usual clinical practice are still needed. These trials should
include validated health-related quality of life outcome measures, need to explicitly report clinical events including hospital admission,
and assess costs and cost-effectiveness.

Regular exercise or exercise with education and psychological support can reduce the likelihood of dying from heart disease.
Coronary heart disease (CHD) is one of the most common forms of heart disease. It affects the heart by restricting or blocking the flow
of blood around it. This can lead to a feeling of tightness in the chest (angina) or a heart attack. Exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation
aims to restore people with CHD to health through either regular exercise alone or a combination of exercise with education and
psychological support. The findings of this review indicate that exercise-based rehabilitation reduces the likelihood of dying from heart
disease and there is moderate evidence of an improvement in quality of life in the predominantly middle aged, male patients included in
these studies. More research is needed to assess the overall health impact of exercise-based rehabilitation in a broader range of patients.
B A C K G R O U N D
Description of the condition
Cardiovascular disease accounts for one-third of deaths globally,
with 7.22 million deaths from coronary heart disease (CHD) in
2002 (WHO 2004). In Europe, CHD is the most common cause
of death and in the UK it accounts for one in five deaths in men
and one in six deaths in women (British Heart Foundation 2005;
Peterssen 2005). Although the mortality rate from CHD has been
falling in the UK, principally due to a reduction in risk factors, par-
ticularly smoking, it has fallen less than in many other developed
countries (Peterssen 2005). Treatments to individuals, including
secondary prevention, explain about 42% of the decline in CHD
mortality in the 1980s and 1990s (Unal 2000).
Description of the intervention
Cardiac rehabilitation has been defined as the “coordinated sum
of interventions required to ensure the best physical, psychological
and social conditions so that patients with chronic or post-acute
cardiovascular disease may, by their own efforts, preserve or resume
optimal functioning in society and, through improved health be-
haviours, slow or reverse progression of disease” (Fletcher 2001).
It is a complex intervention that may involve a variety of thera-
pies, including exercise, risk factor education, behaviour change,
psychological support, and strategies that are aimed at targeting
traditional risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Cardiac rehabili-
tation is an essential part of contemporary heart disease care and is
considered a priority in countries with a high prevalence of CHD.
International clinical guidelines consistently identify exercise ther-
apy as a central element of cardiac rehabilitation (Balady 2007;
2
Exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation for coronary heart disease (Review)
Copyright © 2011 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
 Graham 2007; NICE 2007) i.e. ’exercise-based cardiac rehabilita-
tion’.
Despite the recommendations for exercise-based cardiac rehabil-
itation as an integral component of comprehensive cardiac care
of patients with CHD (particularly those following myocardial
infarction, revascularization or with angina pectoris) and heart
failure, most patients do not receive it (Bethall 2008). Service
provision, though predominantly hospital based, varies markedly,
and referral, enrolment and completion are suboptimal, especially
among women and older people (Beswick 2004). Costs of cardiac
rehabilitation services vary by format of delivery.The UK survey
suggests that costs can range of £50 to £712 per patient treated
depending on the level of staffing, the equipment used and the
intensity of the programme (Evans 2002).
Previous meta-analyses of the effects of exercise-based cardiac reha-
bilitation for CHD patients reported a statistically significant re-
duction in total and cardiac mortality, ranging from 20% to 32%,
in patients receiving exercise therapy compared with usual medical
care (Clark 2005; Jolliffe 2001; Oldridge 1988; O’Connor 1989).
However, the evidence for psychological interventions is less con-
vincing. A Cochrane review showed no evidence of an effect on to-
tal mortality, cardiac mortality, or revascularisation although there
was a significant reduction in the number of non-fatal infarctions
in the psychological intervention group (OR 0.78 [95% CI 0.67
to 0.90]) compared to usual care (Rees 2004). A Cochrane review
of the effect of educational interventions for CHD is currently
being undertaken (Brown 2010).
How the intervention might work
Exercise training has been shown to have direct benefits on the
heart and coronary vasculature, including myocardial oxygen de-
mand, endothelial function, autonomic tone, coagulation and
clotting factors, inflammatory markers, and the development of
coronary collateral vessels (Clausen 1976; Hambrecht 2000).
However, findings of the original Cochrane review of exercise-
based cardiac rehabilitation for CHD supported the hypothesis
that reductions in mortality may also be mediated via the indi-
rect effects of exercise through improvements in the risk factors
for atherosclerotic disease (i.e. lipids, smoking and blood pressure)
(Taylor 2006).
Why it is important to do this review
Our original Cochrane review published in 2001 identified a total
of 35 RCTs in some 8,440 patients (Jolliffe 2001). This review
reported a reduction in total mortality (random effects model,
odds ratio: 0.73, 95% confidence interval: 0.54 to 0.98) with
exercise intervention compared to usual care. Improvements with
exercise were also seen in cardiac death, non-fatal MI, lipid profile
and blood pressure. However, the authors identified a number a
limitations in the evidence base:
• Trials enrolled almost exclusively low-risk, middle-aged
men after myocardial infarction. The exclusion or under
representation of women, elderly people, and other cardiac
groups (post revascularization and angina pectoris) not only
limits the applicability of the evidence to contemporary
cardiovascular practice but also fails to consider those who may
benefit most from rehabilitation.
• The widespread introduction of a variety of drug therapies
as part of the routine management of CHD the cardiac patient
that were not available at the time of the earliest trials may offset
the magnitude of benefit associated with exercise-based
rehabilitation.
• It was unclear whether comprehensive (exercise plus
psychosocial and/or educational interventions) cardiac
rehabilitation offers incremental outcome benefits compared to
exercise only interventions.
• There was a lack of robust evidence for the impact on
patient health-related quality of life, costs and cost-effectiveness.
Additionally, recent meta-analyses of the effects of exercise-based
cardiac rehabilitation in patients with CHD have indicated an in-
crease in the number of RCTs since the publication of the original
Cochrane review (Clark 2005).
The aim of this study is to update the original Cochrane systematic
review of the effects of exercise-based rehabilitation for patients
with CHD.
Changes in this update review
In addition to updating the searches, this update review has: (1)
formally explored the variation in exercise intervention effects us-
ing meta-regression and stratified meta-analysis and (2) not up-
dated exercise capacity and cardiac risk outcomes (i.e. serum lipids,
blood pressure, and smoking behaviour).
O B J E C T I V E S
1. To assess the effectiveness of exercise-based cardiac
rehabilitation (exercise training alone or in combination with
psychosocial or educational interventions) compared with usual
care on mortality, morbidity and health-related quality of life in
patients with CHD.
2. To explore the potential study level predictors of exercise-
based cardiac rehabilitation in patients with CHD.

 Criteria for considering studies for this review
Types of studies
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of exercise-based cardiac re-
habilitation versus usual care with a follow-up period of at least
six months have been sought.
Types of participants
Men and women of all ages, in both hospital-based and commu-
nity-based settings, who have had a myocardial infarction (MI),
or who had undergone revascularisation (coronary artery bypass
grafting, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty or coro-
nary artery stent), or who have angina pectoris or coronary artery
disease defined by angiography have been included.
Studies of participants following heart valve surgery, with heart
failure, with heart transplants or implanted with either cardiac-
resynchronisation therapy (CRT) or implantable defibrillators
(ICD) have been excluded. Studies of participants who completed
a cardiac rehabilitation programme prior to randomisation have
also been excluded.
Types of interventions
Exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation is defined as a supervised or
unsupervisedinpatient, outpatient, orcommunity-orhome-based
intervention including some form of exercise training that is ap-
plied to a cardiac patient population. The intervention could be
exercise training alone or exercise training in addition to psychoso-
cial and/or educational interventions (i.e. “comprehensive cardiac
rehabilitation”).
Usual care could include standard medical care, such as drug ther-
apy, but did not receive any form of structured exercise training
or advice.
Types of outcome measures
All clinical events or other outcome measures reported post-ran-
domisation were included in this review. No maximum limit was
imposed on the length of follow-up.
Primary outcomes
• Total mortality
◦ Cardiovascular mortality
◦ Non-cardiovascular mortality
• Total MI
◦ Fatal MI
◦ Non-fatal MI
• Total revascularizations
◦ CABG
◦ PTCA
◦ Restenting
• Total hospitalisations
◦ Cardiovascular hospitalisations
◦ Other hospitalisations
Secondary outcomes
• Health-related quality of life assessed using validated
instruments (e.g. SF-36, EQ5D)
• Costs and cost-effectiveness
Search methods for identification of studies
As this review forms part of a broader review strategy, that in-
cludes updates of two other Cochrane systematic reviews address-
ing cardiac rehabilitation (Davies 2010a; Rees 2004) and two new
Cochrane reviews - interventions for enhancing uptake and ad-
herence to cardiac rehabilitation (Davies 2010b) and home versus
centre-based cardiac rehabilitation (Taylor 2010), a generic broad
search was initially undertaken. This generic search was then fur-
ther updated for the purposes of this specific review.
Electronic searches
Randomized controlled trials have been identified from the pre-
viously published Cochrane review. This list of studies has been
updated by the authors searching the Cochrane Central Register
of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library Issue
4, 2009, MEDLINE (November 2000 to December 2009), EM-
BASE (November 2000 to December 2009), CINAHL (Novem-
ber 2000 to December 2009), and Science Citation Index Ex-
panded (SCI-Expanded, 1900 to December 2009). Health Tech-
nology Assessment (HTA) and Database of Abstracts of Reviews
of Effects (DARE) databases have been searched via The Cochrane
Library Issue 4, 2009. The generic (cross review) search was un-
dertaken from 2001 (the search end date of the previous Cochrane
review of exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation (Jolliffe 2001)) to
January 2008 with a further update search up to December 2009
for this specific review.
Search strategies were designed with reference to those of the
previous systematic review (Jolliffe 2001). MEDLINE, EMBASE
and CINAHL were searched using a strategy combining selected
MeSH terms and free text terms relating to exercise-based rehabil-
itation and coronary heart disease with RCT filters. The MED-
LINE search strategy was translated into the other databases us-
ing the appropriate controlled vocabulary as applicable. Due to
time and resource constraints, three databases (AMED, BIDS and
SPORTSDISCUSS) included the previous review (Jolliffe 2001)
were not searched in this case.

 Searches have been limited to randomised controlled trials and a
filter applied to limit by humans. Consideration was given to vari-
ations in terms used and spellings of terms in different countries
so that studies were not missed by the search strategy because of
such variations.
See Appendix 1 for a list of the search strategies used.
Searching other resources
Reference lists of retrieved articles and systematic reviews and
meta-analyses published since the original Cochrane review were
checked for any studies not identified by the electronic searches.
Data collection and analysis
Selection of studies
The titles and abstracts of citations identified by the electronic
searches prior to 2008 were examined for possible inclusion by
two reviewers (RST & Philippa Davies) working independently.
The titles and abstracts of citations identified by the electronic
searches from 2008 onwards were examined for possible inclusion
independently by two reviewers (BSH & LF). Full publications
of potentially relevant studies were retrieved (and translated into
English where required) and two reviewers (BSH & JMHC) then
independently determined study eligibility using a standardized
inclusion form. Any disagreements about study eligibility were
resolved by discussion and, if necessary, a third reviewer (RST)
was asked to arbitrate.
Data extraction and management
Data from included studies were extracted by one reviewer (BSH
or JMHC) using standardised data extraction forms and checked
by a second reviewer (JMHC or BSH). If data were presented
numerically (in tables or text) and graphically (in figures), the
numeric data were used because of possible measurement error
when estimating from graphs. A second reviewer confirmed all
numeric calculations and extractions from graphs or figures. Any
discrepancies were resolved by consensus.
Data on patient characteristics (e.g. age, sex, CHD diagnosis) and
details of the intervention (including mode of exercise, duration,
frequency and intensity), nature of usual care and length of follow-
up were also extracted.
Assessment of risk of bias in included studies
Two reviewers (BSH, JMHC) independently assessed the risk of
bias in included studies using the Cochrane Collaboration’s rec-
ommended tool, which is a domain-based critical evaluation of the
following domains: sequence generation; allocation concealment;
blinding of outcome assessment; incomplete outcome data; and
selective outcome reporting (Higgins 2011). Assessments of risk
of bias are provided in the Risk of bias table for each study.
Dealing with missing data
If there were multiple reports of the same study, the duplicate pub-
lications were scanned for additional data. Outcome results have
been extracted at all follow-up points post-randomisation. Study
authors were contacted where necessary to provide additional in-
formation.
Assessment of heterogeneity
If there was significant statistical heterogeneity (P-value <0.10) as-
sociated with an effect estimate, a random effects model was ap-
plied. This model provides a more conservative statistical compar-
ison of the difference between intervention and control because
a confidence interval around the effect estimate is wider than a
confidence interval around a fixed effect estimate. If a statistically
significant difference was still present using the random effects
model, the fixed effect pooled estimate and 95% CI have been
reported because of the tendency of smaller trials, which are more
susceptible to publication bias, to be over weighted with a random
effects analysis (Heran 2008a; Heran 2008b).
Assessment of reporting biases
No language restrictions have been applied.
Data synthesis
Data have been processed in accordance with the Cochrane Hand-
book for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2011).
Data synthesis and analyses have been done using Review Manager
5.0 software and STATA version 10 (Stata Corp., College Station,
Texas).
Dichotomous outcomes for each comparison have been expressed
as relative risks with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Continuous
outcome have been expressed as the mean (±SD) change from
baseline to follow-up. Otherwise, continuous outcomes have been
pooled as weighted mean difference (WMD). If there was a statis-
tically significant absolute risk difference, the associated number
needed to treat/harm was calculated.
Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity
Where possible, stratified meta-analysis (according to time of fol-
low-up, 6 to12 months versus > 12 months) and meta-regression
have been undertaken to explore heterogeneity and examine po-
tential treatment effect modifiers. We tested five a priori hypothe-
ses that there may be differences in the effect of exercise-based
cardiac rehabilitation on total mortality, cardiovascular mortality,

 total MI, and revascularisation (CABG and PTCA) across partic-
ular subgroups: (1) CHD case mix (myocardial infarction-only
trials versus other trials); (2) type of cardiac rehabilitation (exer-
cise-only cardiac rehabilitation versus comprehensive cardiac re-
habilitation); (3) ’dose’ of exercise intervention [dose = duration in
weeks x number of sessions x number of sessions per week] (dose ≥
1000 units versus dose < 1000 units); (4) follow-up period (≤ 12
months versus > 12 months); and (5) year of publication (before
1995 versus 1995 or later).
Year of Publication
We included year of publication as a study level factor (pre versus
post-1995) in order to assess the potential effect of a change in the
standard of usual care over time, that is to reflect when pharma-
cologic agents became established therapies for CHD.
Heterogeneity
Heterogeneityamongstincludedstudieswasexploredqualitatively
(by comparing the characteristics of included studies) and quanti-
tatively (using the chi-squared test of heterogeneity and I2 statis-
tic). Where appropriate, data from each study have been pooled
using a fixed effect model, except where substantial heterogeneity
exists. We planned to pool the results for health-related quality
of life using a standardised mean difference (SMD) but this was
not possible due to the heterogeneity in outcome measures and
methods of reporting findings.
The funnel plot and the Egger test have been used to examine
small study bias (Egger 1997).

Results of the search
Our update cross-cardiac rehabilitation review electronic searches
(to January 2008) yielded a total 11,561 titles plus 1802 titles
from the update search (to December 2009). After reviewing the
titles and abstracts, we retrieved 59 full-text articles for possible
inclusion. A total of 30 papers were excluded: two had follow-
up less than six months, 16 reported no useful outcomes, six had
inappropriate randomisation, one had an inappropriate control,
and five were review articles. In addition, one study was awaiting
classification and two were ongoing studies. Seventeen studies (26
publications) met the inclusion criteria and had extractable data to
assess the effects of exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation compared
with usual care on mortality and morbidity in patients with CHD
(Figure 1).

 Included studies
The original Cochrane review published in 2001 (Jolliffe 2001)
included a total of 35 studies, of which five studies were judged
not to meet the revised inclusion criteria of this review update (see
Excluded studies section).
In addition to the 30 trials (55 publications) from the orig-
inal Cochrane review that met the inclusion criteria of this
update review (Andersen 1981; Bell 1998; Bengtsson 1983;
Bertie 1992; Bethell 1990; Carlsson 1998; Carson 1982; DeBusk

Ornish 1990; Schuler 1992; Shaw 1981; Sivarajan 1982; Specchia
1996; Stern 1983; Vecchio 1981; Vermeulen 1983; WHO 1983;
Wilhelmsen1975), anadditional 17studies(26 publications)have
been identified by the updated search and have met the revised
inclusion criteria (Belardinelli 2001; Bäck 2008; Dugmore 1999;
Giallauria 2008; Hofman-Bang 1999; Kovoor 2006; La Rovere
2002; Manchanda 2000; Marchionni 2003; Seki 2003; Seki 2008;
Ståhle 1999; Toobert 2000; VHSG 2003; Yu 2003; Yu 2004;
Zwisler 2008). Thus, a total of 47 studies reporting data for a
total of 10,794 patients have been included in this review up-
date. Details of the studies included in the review are listed in the
Characteristics of included studies table. The study selection pro-
cess is summarised in the PRISMA flow diagram shown in Figure
1.
Although all exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation, 17 studies were
judged to be exercise-only intervention trials and 29 were judged
to be comprehensive cardiac rehabilitation (exercise plus psychoso-
cial and/or educational interventions); one trial randomly assigned
patients to both exercise-only cardiac rehabilitation and compre-
hensive cardiac rehabilitation (Sivarajan 1982). The majority of
studies were (32 studies, 68%) undertaken in Europe,either as sin-
gle or multicenter studies. Trial sample sizes varied widely from 28
to 2304, with a median intervention duration of three (range 0.25
to 30) months and a follow-up of 24 (range six to 120) months.
Patients with myocardial infarction alone were recruited in 30
trials (64%); the remaining trials recruited either exclusively post-
revascularisation patients (i.e., CABG and PTCA) or both groups
of patients. The ages of patients in the trials ranged from 46 to 84
years. Although over half of the trials (28 studies, 60%) included
women, on average women accounted for only 20% of the patients
recruited.
Characteristics of included interventions
Twenty nine studies compared comprehensive programmes (that
is, exercise plus education or psychological management, or both),
while 17 reported on an exercise only intervention. In addition,
one study randomised patients to a comprehensive programme,
exercise only intervention or usual care (Sivarajan 1982).
The exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation programmes differed
considerably in duration (range 1-12 months), frequency (1-7
sessions/week), and session length (20-90 minutes/session). Most
programmes involved the prescription of individually tailored ex-
ercise programmes, which makes it difficult to precisely quantify
the amount of exercise undertaken. Most home based programmes
included a short initial period of centre based intervention. Centre
based programmes typically involved supervised exercise involving
cycles, treadmills or weight training, while nearly all home based
programmes were based on walking.
Both intervention and control patients received usual care includ-
ing medication, education and advice about diet and exercise, but
control patients received no formal exercise training.
Excluded studies
Five studies that had been included in the original review failed
to meet the revised inclusion criteria of this review update. Of
these, four studies did not report outcomes relevant to this review
(Ballantyne 1982; Carlsson 1997; Krachler 1997; Wosornu 1996)
and one study was not randomised (Kentala 1972). For the up-
dated search, 24 studies (25 publications) were excluded for rea-
sons listed in the Characteristics of excluded studies table, with
the most common reason being a failure to report any of the pre-
specified outcomes of this review update.
Risk of bias in included studies
Limited reporting of the methodology and outcome data in the
published papers of the included trials precluded us, in most cases,
from adequately performing a critical evaluation of the following
domains: sequence generation; allocation concealment; blinding;
incomplete outcome data; selective outcome reporting; and other
sources of bias. Nevertheless,we attempted to assess the risk of bias
for each of the 47 included studies given the available information
in the published trial reports.
Allocation
Nearly all the trial publications simply reported that the trial
was “randomised” but did not provide any details. A total of
8/47 (17%) studies (Andersen 1981; Bell 1998; Bethell 1990;
Erdman 1986; Haskell 1994; Holmbäck 1994; Wilhelmsen 1975;
Zwisler 2008) reported details of appropriate generation of the
random sequence and 7/47 (15%) studies (Bell 1998; Haskell
1994; Holmbäck 1994; Kovoor2006; Schuler1992; VHSG2003;
Zwisler 2008) reported appropriate concealment of allocation.

 Blinding
For exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation trials, it is not possible
to blind patients and clinicians to the intervention. For the large
majority of studies, insufficient information was provided to eval-
uate the blinding of assessors; only 4 of 47 (9%) studies (Fletcher
1994; Ornish 1990; Wilhelmsen 1975; Zwisler 2008) reported
that outcome assessors were blind to group allocation.
Incomplete outcome data
Lossestofollow-upanddropoutwere relativelyhigh, rangingfrom
21% to 48% in 12 trials. Follow-up of 80% or more was achieved
in 33/47 (70%) studies (Andersen 1981; Belardinelli 2001; Bell
1998; Bethell 1990; Bäck 2008; Carlsson 1998; Dugmore 1999;
Engblom 1996; Giallauria 2008; Haskell 1994; Heller 1993;
Holmbäck 1994; Kallio 1979; Kovoor 2006; La Rovere 2002;
Leizorovicz 1991; Lewin 1992; Manchanda 2000; Marchionni
2003; Miller 1984; Oldridge 1991; Schuler 1992; Seki 2003;
Shaw 1981; Specchia 1996; Stern 1983; Ståhle 1999; Toobert
2000; Vermeulen1983; VHSG2003; Wilhelmsen1975; Yu 2003;
Zwisler 2008). Furthermore, reasons for loss to follow and dropout
were often not reported. Two trials (Seki 2008; WHO 1983) did
not report information on losses to follow-up. Several trials have
excluded significant numbers of patients post-randomisation, and
thus in an intention to treat analysis, these then have been regarded
as dropouts.
Selective reporting
A number of the included studies were not designed to assess
treatment group differences in morbidity and mortality (as these
were not the primary outcomes of these trials) and, therefore, may
not have fully reported all clinical events that occurred during the
follow-up period. All studies collecting validated health-related
quality of life outcomes fully reported these outcomes.
Other potential sources of bias
Publication bias
In order to test for the possibility of publication bias, the funnel
plots were created for all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality,
recurrent MI, and revascularisation (CABG and PTCA). There
was no evidence of funnel plot asymmetry or significant Egger
tests for all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality and revascu-
larisation (CABG and PTCA). However, the funnel plot of recur-
rent MI suggests asymmetry and the Egger test was statistically
significant (P = 0.019), which appears to be due to an absence of
negative-result trials of small to medium size (Figure 2).

Effects of interventions
Clinical Events
Mortality
Thirty (N = 8971) of the included studies reported total mortality
(Analysis 1.1); two trials reported both follow-up to 12 months
and longer than 12 months (Wilhelmsen 1975; WHO 1983).
In studies reporting follow-up longer than 12 months, compared
with control, total mortality was reduced with exercise-based car-
diac rehabilitation (RR 0.87 [95% CI 0.75, 0.99]). There was no
significant difference in total mortality up to 12 months follow-
up.
Nineteen (N = 6583) of included studies reported cardiovascular
mortality (Analysis 1.2); one trial reported both follow-up to 12
months and longer than 12 months (WHO 1983). In studies re-
porting follow-up longer than 12 months, compared to control,
cardiovascular mortality was reduced with exercise-based cardiac
rehabilitation (RR 0.74 [95% CI 0.63, 0.87]). There was no sig-
nificant difference in cardiovascular mortality up to 12 months
follow-up.
There was no evidence of statistical heterogeneity across trials for
either total or cardiovascular mortality.
Morbidity
Twenty-five (N = 7294), 22 (N = 4392), and 11 (N = 2241) of the
included studies reported total MI, CABG or PTCA, respectively
(Analysis 1.3; Analysis 1.4; Analysis 1.5); follow-up to 12 months
and longer than 12 months was reported by two studies for MI
(Haskell 1994; WHO 1983), one study for CABG (Ståhle 1999)
and two studies for PTCA (Haskell 1994; Ståhle 1999). There
was no statistically significant difference between exercise-based
cardiac rehabilitation and usual care for these outcome measures.
The pooled risk ratios for total MI, CABG and PTCA were 0.92
(95% CI 0.70, 1.22), 0.91 (95% CI 0.67, 1.24) and 1.02 (95%
CI 0.69, 1.50), respectively, up to 12 months follow-up. In studies
reporting follow-up longer than 12-months, the pooled risk ratios
for total MI, CABG and PTCA were 0.97 (95% CI 0.82, 1.15),
0.93 (95% CI 0.68, 1.27) and 0.89 (95% CI 0.66, 1.19) respec-
tively. There was no evidence of statistical heterogeneity across tri-
als for any of the morbidity outcomes.

 Hospitalisations
Ten (N = 2379) of the included studies reported hospital admis-
sions; one study reported both follow-up to 12 months and longer
than 12 months (Hofman-Bang 1999). In studies reporting up to
12 months follow-up, total readmissions were reduced with ex-
ercise-based cardiac rehabilitation compared with usual care (RR
0.69, 95% CI 0.51, 0.93; Analysis 1.6). There was no significant
difference in total hospitalisations in studies with follow-up longer
than 12 months.
Health-related quality of life
Ten trials assessed health-related quality of life using a range of
validateddisease-specific(e.g.QLMI)andgeneric(e.g.Short-form
36) outcome measures (Table 1). Given both the heterogeneity
in outcome measures and methods of reporting findings, a meta-
analysis was not undertaken.
Although most trials demonstrated an improvement in baseline
quality of life following exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation, a
within group improvement was also often reported in control pa-
tients. Only in seven out of 10 trials was there evidence of a sig-
nificantly higher level of quality of life with exercise-based car-
diac rehabilitation than control at follow-up (Belardinelli 2001;
Dugmore 1999; Sivarajan 1982; Yu 2004).
Costs
Three of the included studies reported limited data on costs per
patient (Kovoor 2006; Marchionni 2003; Yu 2004). These results
are summarised in Table 2. It was not possible to compare the
costs directly across studies due to differences in currencies and
the timing of studies.
In two of the three studies the total healthcare costs associated
with exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation and usual care were not
statistically significantly different. In Marchionni 2003, the total
healthcare costs associated with exercise-based cardiac rehabilita-
tion were higher ($4839 more per patient) than usual care.
Only Oldridge 1991 evaluated the cost-effectiveness of exercise-
based cardiac rehabilitation in post-MI patients by combining cost
information with time trade-off measures of health-related quality
of life and data on mortality derived from a 1989 meta-analysis
(O’Connor 1989). Based on their analysis, the authors concluded
that rehabilitation was “an efficient use of health-care resources
and may be economically justified” (Oldridge 1993).
Meta regression
Predictors of all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, recur-
rent MI, and revascularisation (CABG and PTCA) were exam-
ined using univariate meta-regression. Covariates defined a priori
included: CHD case mix (myocardial infarction-only trials versus
other trials); type of cardiac rehabilitation (exercise-only versus
comprehensive cardiac rehabilitation); ’dose’ of exercise interven-
tion (calculated as the number of weeks, multiplied by the num-
ber of sessions per week, multiplied by the duration of sessions
in hours); follow-up period (≤ 12 months versus > 12 months);
and publication date (before 1995 versus 1995 or later). No sta-
tistically significant associations were seen in any of these analyses
(Table 3, Table 4, Table 5, Table 6, Table 7).
D I S C U S S I O N
Summary of main results
This updated systematic review of exercise-based cardiac rehabil-
itation has allowed analysis of an increased number of patients
from an additional 17 studies published from 2000 to 2009. A
total of 47 RCTs, with 10,794 patients, have now been included.
In accord with the original Cochrane review and previous meta-
analyses (Clark 2005; Jolliffe 2001; O’Connor 1989; Oldridge
1988) a reduction in both total and cardiac mortality was ob-
served in CHD patients randomised to exercise-based rehabilita-
tion. However, this updated review shows that this mortality bene-
fit is limited to studies with a follow-up of greater than 12 months.
We also found that with exercise the rate of hospital readmissions
may be reduced in studies up to 12 months follow-up (based on 4
trials with 54/254 versus 73/225 events), but not in longer term
follow-up. There was no difference between exercise-based cardiac
rehabilitation and usual care groups in the risk of recurrent my-
ocardial infarction or revascularization at any duration of follow-
up.
This reduction in total and cardiovascular mortality with exercise
therapy appears consistent across a number of CHD groups (e.g.,
post-MI, post-revascularisation), as well as a range of strategies for
deliveryof the exercise-basedintervention. We comparedtrialsthat
assessed exercise therapy alone with exercise in combination with
educational and psychological co-interventions and there appears
to be no difference in mortality effect. In addition, there was no
difference in mortality effect by exercise ’dose’ a composite measure
based on the overall duration of the exercise program plus the
intensity, frequency, and length of exercise sessions.
The mechanism for reduced cardiovascular mortality in patients
who have received exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation is not clear,
but may be due to improved myocardial revascularisation, protec-
tion against fatal dysrhythmias, improved cardiovascular risk fac-
tor profile, improved cardiovascular fitness, or increased patient
surveillance (Oldridge 1988; Taylor 2006).
There were insufficient data to definitely definitely conclude that
exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation improves health-related qual-
ity of life compared to control. Only 10 of included trials reported
outcomes based on a validated health-related quality of life mea-
sure. Furthermore, only three of these 10 trials randomised more
11

 than 250 patients; thus, providing relatively adequate power (80%
and 5% alpha) to detect a modest difference (standardised effect
size of 0.25) between exercise therapy and usual care. Heterogene-
ity of health-related quality of life outcome measures and their
reporting precluded us from quantitatively pooling the available
data across trials. Generic health-related quality of life measures
that lack sensitivity to change with cardiac treatment, particularly
in comparison with disease-specific measures, were used in nearly
all the trials (Oldridge 2003; Taylor 1998).
All participants in the included studies had documented CHD,
the majority of the participants having suffered an MI. Some par-
ticipants had documented CHD having suffered angina or under-
gone coronary angiography, while others had undergone CABG.
We have combined these different patient groups as there are in-
sufficient data at present to stratify trials by type of CHD. The
number of women participants was low and few studies mentioned
the ethnic origin of their participants. The mean age of the partic-
ipants was 56 years. Although most studies had an upper age limit
of at least 65 years of age, this is not reflected in the mean age of
the participants. The majority of the studies had exclusion criteria
that would have excluded those participants who had co-morbid-
ity, or heart failure. In some studies this may have accounted for
up to 60% of the patients considered for the trial, and certainly
the older patients would be more likely to be affected.
Quality of the evidence
We found no evidence of publication bias for total mortality, CV
mortality, CABG or PTCA. There was evidence of small study
bias for total MI.
As with the original Cochrane review, this update review has re-
vealed limitations in the available RCT evidence, most notably
the poor reporting of methodology and results in many trial pub-
lications (Jolliffe 2001). The method of randomization, alloca-
tion concealment, or blinding of outcomes assessment was rarely
described. Although the quality of reporting tends to be poorer
for older studies, it does not appear to have appreciably improved
over the last decade. Furthermore, incomplete outcome data (pri-
marily due to losses to follow-up or dropouts) were insufficiently
addressed in most trials. Losses to follow-up were relatively high
across trials (approximately one third of trials reported a greater
than 20% loss to follow-up) but reasons for dropout were often
not reported. Several trials excluded significant numbers of pa-
tients post-randomisation, and thus in an intention-to-treat anal-
ysis, these patients have been regarded as dropouts. This may be
partly explained by the fact that the majority of trials were not
designed to assess treatment group differences in mortality and
morbidity but instead surrogate measures of treatment efficacy,
such as exercise capacity or lipid levels.

Implications for practice
In medium to longer term (i.e. 12 or more months follow-up)
exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation is effective in reducing overall
and cardiovascular mortality and appears to reduce the risk of hos-
pital admissions in the shorter-term (< 12 months follow-up) in
patients with CHD. The available evidence does not demonstrate
a reduction in the risk of total MI, CABG or PTCA with exercise-
based cardiac rehabilitation as compared to usual care at any du-
ration of follow-up. Exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation should
be recommended for patients similar to those included in the ran-
domised controlled trials - predominantly lower risk younger men
who had suffered myocardial infarction or are post-revascularisa-
tion. It is a question of judgement whether evidence is sufficient to
under-represented groups, particularly angina pectoris and higher
risk CHD patients and those with major co-morbidities. There
appears to be little to choose between exercise only or in combina-
tion with psychosocial or educational cardiac rehabilitation inter-
ventions. In the absence of definitive cost-effectiveness compar-
ing these two approaches to exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation it
would be rational to use cost considerations to determine practise.
Implications for research
In spite of inclusion of recent trial evidence including more post-
revascularisation and female patients, the population of CHD pa-
tients studied in this review update remains predominately low risk
middle-aged males following MI or PTCA. There has been little
identification of the ethnic origin of the participants. It is possible
that patients who would have benefited most from exercise-based
cardiac rehabilitation were excluded from the trials e.g. those of
older age or those with co-morbidity. Therefore, well-designed,
and adequately reported RCTs in groups of CHD patients more
representative of usual clinical practice are still needed. These tri-
als should include validated health-related quality of life outcome
measures, need to explicitly report clinical events including hos-
pital admission, and assess costs and cost-effectiveness.

Characteristics of included studies [ordered by study ID]
Andersen 1981
Methods
Post MI randomised four weeks after discharge. 88 participants were randomised, but
13 failed to follow up. Therefore 75 took part in the study
Participants
75 men < 66 yrs with 1st MI.
Mean age
I = 52.2 (+/-7.5),
C = 55.6 (+/-6.3).
Interventions
Aerobic activity e.g. running, cycling, skipping + weights for 1 hour x 2 weekly for 2
months, then x 1 week for 10 months. Then continue at home.
F/U @ 1, 13, 25, & 37 months post discharge.
Outcomes
Total & CHD mortality and non fatal MI.
Notes
Several participants in C trained on own initiative, but were analysed as intention to
treat.
Authors concluded that PT after MI appears to reduce consequences and to improve
PWC, but PWC declines once participant on their own.
PT had no effect on period of convalescence or return to work, but age and previous
occupation were of significance

Inclusion: <65 years with MI
Exclusion: decisions based on cardiologist: severe cardiac failure, PMI-syndrome, aortic
regurgitation, cerebral infarct hemiparesis, disease of hip, status post-poliomyelitis, am-
putation of lower extremity, Diabetes with retinopathy, hyper/hypo thyroidism, hyper-
parathyroidism, mental illness
Interventions
Exercise intervention: Duration: 3 months; Frequency: 30 min twice weekly. Mode:
physical training, interval training of large muscle groups, jogging, callisthenics Co-
interventions:
counselling, social measures, group and individual. Intensity: graded individually
Outcomes
Total mortality, CHD mortality, non-fatal MI up to average 14 months
Notes
Most emphasis on social/ psychological aspects.
171 patients were randomised and at discharge the cardiologist decided whether the
patient was fit to take part in the rehab programme - 45 patients were excluded at this
point. 7 of intervention group declined to take part, but 6 of these were seen at follow up
and included in the analysis because “control group probably had a comparable number
who would have declined further treatment.”

Notes
229 patients were randomised; 14 in the intervention group and 15 in control dropped
out before the first exercise test due to death, refusal or other problems. Therefore 200
took part in the study
Cardiac mortality of 3% pa, once patients survived to be in the trial. Suggests more
severely affected patients were not included.
Significant predictors of cardiac death were pulmonary oedema on admission, compli-
cations during admission, one or more previous infarcts, increasing age and low initial
fitness

Weekly clinic appointments 3 months post discharge for progressive callisthenics and
walking. Exercise 2 x daily until RTW and then x 1 daily.
Ex + T&C:
Same exercise programme + 8 x 1 hour teaching/ counselling sessions with family &
friends
F/U 6 months.
Outcomes
Total mortality; health-related quality of life: Sickness Impact Profile
Notes
Several reports of the same trial all with various bits of information. Authors conclude
that multiple intervention trial of this short duration did not change patient’s behaviour.

Intervention: 8 weeks of supervised, structured physical training of three periods of 20 min per week, targeting
a heart rate of 60-70% of the individual’s maximum; home-based physical exercise training with the same
basic schedule as in the supervised period; quantification of patients’ compliance with the exercise programme
by the use of wristwatches, information stored in the watch memory being retrieved once a month during
the 3-year follow-up period; and life-style modification with an emphasis on the cessation of smoking and on
healthy nutrition and weight control
Control: Conventional care.
Outcomes
Primary: Quality of life.
Secondary: total mortality, cardiovascular mortality, morbidity and recurrence rates of coronary events
throughout a 3-year follow-up period

Changes in this update review
Given its policy focus, in addition to updating the original Cochrane review, this update review:
1. Excluded exercise capacity and cardiac risk factors outcomes and added costs.
2. Limited the inclusion to those studies that assess outcomes at six months or longer.
