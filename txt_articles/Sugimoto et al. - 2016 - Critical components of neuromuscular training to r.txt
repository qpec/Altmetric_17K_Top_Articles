 female athletes as participants. Two independent reviewers extracted studies which met the 
inclusion criteria. Methodological quality of included study and strength of recommendation were 
evaluated. Number of ACL injuries and participants in control and intervention groups, age of 
participants, dosage of neuromuscular training, exercise variations within neuromuscular training 
and status of verbal feedback were extracted.
Results—The meta-regression analyses identified age of participants, dosage of neuromuscular 
training, exercise variations within neuromuscular training and utilisation of verbal feedback as 
significant predictors of ACL injury reduction (p=0.01 in fixed-effects model, p=0.03 in random-
effects model). Inclusion of 1 of the 4 components in neuromuscular training could reduce ACL 
injury risk by 17.2–17.7% in female athletes. No significant heterogeneity and publication bias 
effects were detected. Strength of recommendation was rated as A (recommendation based on 
consistent and good-quality patient-oriented study evidence).
Conclusions—Age of participants, dosage of neuromuscular training, exercise variations within 
neuromuscular training and utilisation of verbal feedback are predictors that influence the 
optimisation of prophylactic effects of neuromuscular training and the resultant ACL injury 
reduction in female athletes.
Introduction
ACL injury is a major concern in the field of sports medicine. Individuals who have 
sustained ACL disruption experience various functional impairments, including inability to 
decelerate, cut, pivot and perform other dynamic movements necessary for sport. Also, 
comorbidity such as meniscus tear,1–3 avulsion fractures4 and medial collateral tear15 is 
often present with ACL injury. Owing to these functional impairments and clinical 
significance, patients with an ACL-deficient knee often choose to have reconstruction 
surgery, and the number of reported ACL reconstruction surgery cases is as high as 350 000 
annually in the USA alone.6 Although ACL reconstruction surgery has a high success rate, 
younger and more physically active individuals have a relatively high rate of reinjury,7 
which ranges from 24%8 to 29%9 along with strength deficits,10 reduced postural 
control1112 and altered kinematics.1314 Furthermore, a systematic review that synthesised a 
total of 31 studies indicated that 48% of knee osteoarthritis prevalence rates more than 10 
years following ACL reconstruction surgery.15 The negative impact of knee osteoarthritis 
development on quality of life has also been reported.16
Owing to the unfavourable health consequences following ACL injury, preventive 
interventions have been proposed.17 One of the proposed methods to reduce ACL injury is to 
implement neuromuscular training (NMT) programme. In order to examine the efficacy of 
NMT programme, a number of different NMT programmes have been implemented.18–31 
Systematic review and meta-analysis studies have examined the effectiveness of those NMT 
programmes by comparing the number of ACL injuries between the intervention and control 
groups and reported consistent evidence: NMT is an effective intervention to reduce ACL 
injuries in female athletes.32–34
The reported NMT programmes are diverse, and the question remains as to which specific 
components of NMT contribute to the fullest prophylactic effects of NMT and are essential

 for ACL injury reduction.3335 To identify essential elements needed to maximise 
prophylactic effects of the preventive NMT, a series of subgroup analyses were performed 
based on different age groups, dosage categorisations, exercise genres and intervention 
compliance/adherence.3236–38 Results of those analyses indicate that the prophylactic 
effectiveness of NMT is influenced by the age of participants, dosage of NMT, type and 
number of exercises and level of compliance/adherence.3236–38 In addition to those studies, 
recent literature disseminates importance of verbal feedback on biomechanical alteration in 
dynamic movements.39–41 In order to evaluate these key components accurately, the current 
study employed a meta-regression analysis. The meta-regression can analyse a global effect 
of these key components on ACL injury rate using a logistic regression model and accurately 
quantify ACL injury risk. This analytical approach enables to evaluate which component of 
NMT is critical to enhance prophylactic effectiveness of NMT along with risk reduction of 
ACL injury, which is a limitation of meta-analysis.33 Therefore, analysis of combinatory and 
synergistic effects that can measure contribution of specific key NMT components on ACL 
injury risk has not been documented in past studies. Performance of a meta-regression 
analysis with these key components may enhance the precision of NMT intervention design 
to optimise ACL injury risk reduction. Furthermore, results of the current study may give 
practical knowledge to clinicians who aim to take preventive initiatives for ACL injury 
reduction in physically active population. Thus, the primary purpose of the present study 
was to investigate synergistic effects of combining key components in NMT that optimise 
ACL injury reduction in female athletes through meta-regression analysis. It was 
hypothesised that key components included in this analysis—age of participants, dosage of 
NMT, exercise variations within NMT and utilisation of verbal feedback—are predictors of 
ACL injury reduction in female athletes. The secondary purpose was to further examine age 
effects of NMT on ACL injury reduction in female athletes.
Methods
Literature search and criteria
A literature search was performed using PubMed and EBSCO host (CINAHL, MEDLINE 
and SPORTDiscus), which is displayed in table 1. The search was performed on 3 
September 2015. The keyword search was performed by application of a combination of the 
following words: ‘knee,’ ‘anterior cruciate ligament,’ ‘ACL,’ ‘prospective,’ 
‘neuromuscular,’ ‘training,’ ‘female,’ and ‘prevention.’ Language was limited to English, 
and all participants were human. The following inclusion criteria were applied: (1) the 
number of ACL injury incidence was reported, (2) an NMT intervention aimed to reduce 
ACL incidence was applied, (3) a comparison group was used, (4) a prospective controlled 
trial study design was employed and (5) females were included as participants. Primary 
author performed the literature search. Abstracts, posters and unpublished data were 
excluded. When eligibility of certain studies was questionable, primary author and 
secondary author discussed and determined the status based on the five inclusion criteria. 
During the literature search, a cross-referencing was also performed when studies that met 
inclusion criteria cited other studies.

 Risk of bias
To examine risk of bias, the Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro) scale was used to 
analyse methodological quality of the included studies. The PEDro scale consists of 11 
binary (yes/no) questions and is a widely accepted measurement tool for rating the 
methodological quality of randomised clinical intervention studies. The PEDro scale of each 
reviewed study was evaluated and reported in table 2. Primary and secondary authors 
independently examined the PEDro scale. Discrepancies between the authors were settled by 
arbitration and consensus.
Level of evidence and strength of recommendation assessment method
To evaluate the quality of the current analysis, the Strength of Recommendation Taxonomy 
(SORT) was implemented.42 The SORT was designed to generate strength of 
recommendation based on the quality of the reviewed studies. The reviewed studies were 
classified either level 1 (good-quality patient-oriented evidence based on high-quality 
individual randomised control trial) or level 2 (limited-quality patient-oriented evidence 
based on lower quality clinical trial and cohort study) by primary and secondary authors. 
The patient-oriented evidence refers to information pertinent to patients such as morbidity 
and mortality42 and ACL injury was used in this project. After each reviewed study was 
evaluated, the following scales were determined by primary and secondary authors to 
express strength of the current analysis of evidence: A (consistent patient-oriented 
evidence), B (inconsistent evidence or limited-quality patient-oriented evidence) and C 
(consensus, usual practice, opinion, disease-oriented evidence).
Data extraction
For the primary purpose, the number of ACL injuries and the number of participants in each 
group (control and intervention groups) were extracted. When included studies included two 
consecutive years of NMT intervention, the numbers of ACL injuries and participants in 
control and intervention groups during first year were extracted. Similarly, to analyse effects 
of age, dosage, exercise and feedback, each variable was reviewed and extracted. 
Specifically, in order to analyse participants' age effects, a tertile age categorisation, mid 
teens (aged 14–18 years), late teens (aged 18–20 years) and early adults (older than 20 
years), was developed. Dosage was divided by two components: duration and frequency of 
NMT. Time spent for NMT was labelled as duration. Dichotomous categorisation of short 
(up to 20 min of NMT) and long (more than 20 min of NMT) NMT duration was made. 
NMT frequency was classified either single (one NMT session per week) or multiple (at 
least two NMT sessions per week) categorisations. Similarly, two types of categorisations 
were generated for investigation of the effects of exercise variations: single (only one type of 
exercise) or several (more than one type of exercises). Status of verbal feedback was also 
dichotomised and rated either absence or presence based on availability of written 
statements in original studies. For the secondary purpose, early teen (younger than 14 years) 
category was also developed. These data were carefully reviewed and extracted by two 
independent reviewers. When there were discrepancies between the two reviewers during the 
data extraction and categorisation process, a third reviewer was invited to resolve the 
discrepancies.

 Data synthesis
To determine combinatory effects of age, dosage, exercise and feedback, each study was 
evaluated with a numerical point system. Previous studies that examined effects of age, 
dosage and exercise on ACL injury expressed the risk reduction through OR, which ranges 
from 0.28 to 1.15.323638 The reported OR was divided by 3 in order to classify each 
component to 1, 2 and 3 point. Following classifications were made: OR>0.77=1, OR 
between 0.76 and 0.39=2 and OR<0.38=3. Similar tertile approaches of ORs were 
previously performed.323637 Higher points were given to each component that demonstrated 
lower OR, which is indicative of greater ACL injury reduction. On the basis of the OR 
categorisations, following numerical points were defined in each age, dosage and exercise 
components:
Age : early adults = 1; late teens = 2; mid - teens = 3
Dosage : duration : short NMT session = 1, long NMT session = 2 frequency : single NMT 
session per week = 1; multiple NMT sessions per week = 2
Exercise : single exercise type = 1; several exercise types = 3
Several exercise types were labelled 3 because previous investigation identified NMT 
programmes consisted of several exercise genres generated OR of 0.32.38 As there were no 
previous subgroup analyses based on status of feedback in NMT, effect of verbal feedback 
was conservatively estimated and expressed as:
Feedback : absence of verbal feedback = 0, presence of verbal feedback = 1
To identify age effects of NMT on ACL injury reduction, ACL injury was categorised by 
early teens (under 14 years), mid teens (aged 14–18 years), late teens (aged 18–20 years) 
and early adults (older than 20 years).
Data analysis
The points for each study were summed and expressed as a numerical study score (values 0–
11), which was incorporated in a meta-regression model. A regression line was applied to 
express effects of the study scores (x-axis) on ACL injury. Since the meta-regression 
involves a logistic regression model, log OR (LOR) was displayed on the y-axis. To compare 
a ratio of ACL injuries in participants between intervention and comparison groups, an OR 
was used. In order to explain the per cent increase/decrease in odds, the LOR was further 
converted to OR by using following mathematical formulas:
Fixed-effects and random-effects models were analysed. It was assumed that the effect size 
of each study was different, and a fixed-effects model does not adjust variability among 
reviewed studies. Thus, the result of the fixed-effects models is proportional to the actual

 effect size of each study. Conversely, a random-effects model incorporates variability among 
studies and minimises the effect. Coefficient of determination (R2) value of random-effects 
model was calculated to determine variability of generated model. The R2 of fixed-effects 
model was not analysed because fixed-effects model reflects actual effect size of each study 
so that between-study variance is considered as 0. For the same reason, only random-effects 
model was used to determine age effects of NMT on ACL injury. I2 statistics were employed 
to examine total variation across the included studies due to heterogeneity as opposed to 
random chance. Egger's regression and trim and fill plot were used to examine potential 
risks of publication bias assessment. The α level of all analyses was set a priori at <0.05. A 
95% CI was also incorporated. All analyses were performed using comprehensive meta-
analysis software (BioStat, Englewood, New Jersey, USA).
Results
A total of 14 studies18–31 met the inclusion criteria of the current analyses. A total of 23 544 
athletes (intervention group n=10 634; control group n=12 910) were included in the 
analyses. The study design, sports, age, dosage, exercise, feedback, study scores and number 
of ACL injuries in intervention and control groups of each NMT programme were 
summarised and were displayed in table 3.
Meta-regression: fixed-effects model
The slope of the regression line that represents the 14 reviewed studies18–31 demonstrated 
that the four variables in the study scores are statistically significant predictors of ACL 
injury LOR (p=0.01, β1= −0.29, 95% CI −0.33 to −0.05) (figure 1). The mathematical 
model generated ACL OR of 0.828, which can be translated as 17.2% of ACL risk can be 
reduced if one of the four components was included.
Meta-regression: random-effects model
The slope of the regression line that represented the 14 reviewed studies18–31 showed that 
the four variables included in the study scores are significant predictors of ACL injury LOR 
(p=0.03, β1=−0.20, 95% CI −0.37 to −0.03) (figure 2). The mathematical model indicated 
ACL OR of 0.823, which can be interpreted as 17.7% of ACL injury risk can be reduced if 
one of the four components was included.
Coefficient of determination
The R2 value was analysed based on ratio of the between-study variance and total between-
study variance. The obtained R2 value was 0.73, which can be translated that 73% of 
variability of the random-effects model was explained by the four components.
Age effect of NMT on ACL injury reduction
There was a statistically greater ACL injury reduction in midteens (14–18 years old: n=17 
304, p=0.01, OR=0.293, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.44) compared to early teens (under 14 years old: 
n=2135, p=0.45, OR=0.288, 95% CI 0.01 to 7.09), late teens (18–20 years old: n=1711, 
p=0.07, OR=0.476, 95% CI 0.21 to 1.07), and early adults (older than 20 years old: n=2394, 
p=0.97, OR=1.011, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.64) (figure 3).

 Heterogeneity
The I2 statistics of the reviewed 14 studies18–31 did not reach statistical significance (p=0.09, 
I2 value: 36.4). Thus, significant heterogeneity effects were not found.
Bias assessment
Egger's regression for the publication bias for the 14 studies18–31 showed an interception at 
−0.17 (p=0.41, one-tailed test, 95% CI −1.93 to 1.59), indicating no publication bias, and the 
trim and fill plot also displayed no publication bias (figure 4).
Evidence synthesis
In the current analysis, seven of the included clinical trials192224–262829 were rated as level 1 
(high-quality individual randomised control trial), while seven clinical trials18202123273031 
were rated as level 2 (lower quality clinical trial and cohort study). Although the number of 
level 1 and 2 clinical trials was equal, the current meta-analysis supports consistency of 
evidence since 11 of the 14 reviewed studies demonstrated fewer ACL injuries in NMT 
intervention groups compared to control groups. On the basis of the consistency of the 
results from the included clinical trials, the strength of recommendation grade is A 
(recommendation based on consistent and good-quality patient-oriented study evidence).
Discussion
Combinatory effects of age, dosage, exercise and feedback on ACL injury reduction
The current project focused on determination of synergistic effects of combining key 
components in NMT that optimise ACL injury reduction in female athletes. Past studies 
demonstrated prophylactic effectiveness of NMT as an intervention to reduce ACL injury 
risk.32–35 Also, a series of subgroup analyses identified key components associated with 
NMT.3236–38 However, combinatory effects of the key NMT components found in the 
previous subgroup analyses have not been answered. With using a meta-regression analysis, 
combinatory and synergistic effects of the key NMT components on ACL injury risk were 
quantified. On the basis of the significant association, the age of participants, NMT dosage, 
exercise variations within NMT, and utilisation of verbal feedback are considered key 
predictors of ACL injury reduction with an OR of 0.823–0.828 (figures 1 and 2). It can be 
interpreted that the risk of ACL injury can be reduced by 17.2–17.7% given that any of the 
four key components were incorporated in NMT. The obtained combination of the four 
components explains prophylactic effectiveness of NMT variations up to 73%. The ideal 
components of NMT that potentially influence outcome of NMT on ACL injury were 
unclear.33 However, the current study provides the more specific guidelines for the 
components of NMT prevention procedures.
It is observable that the regression model was most heavily influenced by one study,18 
located at the upper left side of figures 1 and 2. On the basis of our definitions, this study 
was rated as one of the lowest scores (table 1) and reported more ACL injuries in the 
intervention group versus the control group.18 In this study, female soccer players were 
instructed to perform balance board exercises 10–15 min three times per week during the in-
season. The dosage appears sufficient, but ages of the participants were slightly older (mean

 ages: 20.4 years old), and only one type of exercise type was incorporated. Combination of 
all the aspects may have influenced the negative outcome of this particular study.18
Study scores of the five studies1921252831 were rated >9, and one common aspect in the five 
studies is the dosage of NMT. NMT protocols of all five studies were longer than 20 min of 
duration and at least two times per week in frequency. Previous subgroup analysis 
investigation reported an inverse dose–response association between NMT volume and ACL 
injury reduction.36 Therefore, the dosage is definitely a crucial point to consider for the 
development and implementation of NMT. In addition, it is interesting to note that the three 
studies with the highest study scores aimed to prevent ACL injury and also enhance athletic 
performance skills.192125 One study24 measured variables associated with athletic 
performance.43 Using female soccer players, this study compared lower extremity strength 
and athletic performance tests including vertical jump tests, sprint running and soccer skill 
tests between intervention and control groups, but no significant difference was found 
between the two groups. Therefore, association between prophylactic effectiveness of NMT 
and athletic performance enhancement is inconclusive.
Effect of age
Two studies implemented the same NMT programme into the mid teens (14–18 years old) 
and late teens (19–20 years old) populations.2125 One of the two studies that included 
midteens showed significant ACL injury reduction in two consecutive years21 (p=0.0001 
year 1, p=0.0047 year 2). However, the study that implemented the same NMT programme 
for the late teens did not demonstrate significant ACL injury reduction.25 (p=0.07). The risk 
reduction of the intervention group in relation to control group in the study in mid teens was 
81.9% compared to 73.4% in the study with late teens.44 In order to investigate the effect of 
age further, early teen (participants who are younger than 14 years old) category was 
created, and a subgroup analysis was performed. As the number of participants who were 
under 14 years old was few, the analysis demonstrated a wide 95% CIs and did not show 
statistical significance (p=0.45). However, compared to participants categorised in other age 
groups, early teens demonstrated the lowest OR (OR: 0.288, 95% CI 0.01 to 7.09) (figure 3). 
This finding is important from a standpoint of when the female athletes should begin 
preventive NMT. Since the peak age of ACL injury in female population is during the mid 
teens,45 it may be beneficial to begin the practice of preventive NMT in early teens. If 
appropriate NMT programmes are initiated prior to the time when female athletes are 
susceptible to ACL injury, risk of ACL injuries may be substantially prevented. Therefore, 
implementation of NMT in early ages is the first step for ACL injury reduction in female 
athletes.
Effect of dosage
An inverse dose–response relationship (the longer and more frequent NMT was practiced, 
the fewer ACL injuries were observed) was previously reported.36 Additionally, a previous 
subgroup analysis also reported a meaningful clinical implication: nearly 70% of ACL 
injuries can be reduced if the NMT is performed for 30 min duration and two times per week 
of frequency during the in-season.36 In this manuscript, the effect of dosage was analysed 
based on duration and frequency, and the current results confirmed that NMT prophylactic

 effectiveness on ACL injury is dose dependent. Owing to the inverse dose–response 
association,36 securing sufficient time for performing preventive NMT is a critical issue. 
Two reviewed studies noted low compliance to the given NMT was a limitation,2024 and two 
other studies analysed effect of compliance on ACL injury37 and athletic injuries.46 To 
understand the compliance of NMT further, one study investigated coaches' perception of 
the NMT and identified a lack of knowledge, time restriction and lack of understanding and 
support as a barrier to implementing a NMT.47 Therefore, having educated healthcare 
practitioners who can bridge these gaps may be a key to successfully reduce ACL injury in 
young female athletes.
Effect of exercise variation
A previous investigation found a greater prophylactic effect on ACL injuries in NMT 
programmes that had multiple types of exercises compared to studies that instituted only a 
single type of exercise.38 Thus, exercise modality variations within NMT appeared to be 
critical. For instance, one study did not find significant ACL injury reduction in performing 
balance exercises alone.18 Similarly, another study that incorporated one type of exercises 
(plyometric exercises), but not other types of exercises, also failed to demonstrate ACL 
injury reduction.23 In short, a single type of exercise such as performing balance or 
plyometric exercises in isolation is not an effective exercise modality selection to reduce 
ACL injury. However, incorporating both exercises is more likely to demonstrate high 
prophylactic effectiveness. An investigation by Petersen et al used a programme with a 
combination of balance and plyometrics and did record fewer numbers of ACL injuries in 
the intervention group (78.8% of risk reduction relative to control group).44 Furthermore, 
NMT programmes that incorporated strengthening and proximal control exercises 
demonstrated significant decreases in ACL injury reduction when compared to NMT 
programmes that did not include these components.38 One of the novel findings in this 
review process was to observe a trend to include proximal control exercises in recent NMT 
programmes.2427–29 The NMT programmes which included proximal control training 
demonstrated greater ACL injury reduction.38 Those exercises included plank2429 and side 
plank2429 as well as sit-ups/abdominal curl,2731 push-up and upper body weight training.31 
Numerous laboratory controlled studies that investigated the influence of proximal segments 
on lower extremity muscles reported an association between trunk and hip strength and knee 
joint kinematics.48–50 Therefore, the inclusion of trunk stabilisation and posterior chain 
strengthening exercise among plyometric and strength training components appear to be key 
to optimise the beneficial effects of NMT to reduce ACL injury.
Effect of verbal feedback
One reviewed study20 implemented 15 min of balance exercises once per week in female 
handball players. This study reported ACL injury reduction in the first intervention season 
compared to observation control season, but the reduction was not significant.20 (p=0.62, 
OR=0.87, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.52) Owing to the limited effect, a few modifications were 
introduced in the second intervention season: implementation of more sport (handball)-
specific movements, challenging balance exercises, and emphasis on quality of movements 
with verbal feedback. To enhance the awareness of knee joint alignment, verbal cues such as 
‘knee over toe’ was incorporated. With these modifications, fewer numbers of ACL injuries

 were recorded in the second intervention season.20 (p=0.15, OR=0.64, 95% CI0.35 to 1.18) 
Although it is difficult to identify which aspect contributed to further ACL injury reduction 
from the first to the second intervention seasons, including possible carry-over effects, use of 
verbal feedback could have provided beneficial effects on ACL injury reduction. After this 
study was published, a few ACL injury prevention studies incorporated verbal feedback into 
their programmes and subsequently demonstrated greater prophylactic effectiveness of 
NMT.222528 Another reviewed study used verbal cues including ‘land softly’ and ‘don't let 
knees cave inward,’ and this study reported significant ACL injury reduction. (p=0.04, injury 
rate ratio =0.07 in intervention group vs injury rate ratio =0.26 in control group).28 Recent 
studies have also reported more prophylactically favourable biomechanical alterations when 
feedback mechanism was added to NMT39–41
Limitations
The present study was initially designed to include compliance/adherence of NMT as 
another key component. However, many reviewed studies did not record the compliance/
adherence information in the original studies, or, the measurement methods varied 
considerably among reviewed studies. Therefore, this current meta-regression model was 
unable to include compliance/adherence as a key of components. Moreover, the focused 
populations (young female athletes) were homogenous, and significant heterogeneity effects 
were not detected, but several different types of sports were included in the reviewed studies, 
which were soccer,18192123–2527–2931 handball,202230 basket-ball,232831 volleyball2331 and 
floorball.26 Compared to soccer, the number of studies focused on handball, basketball, 
volleyball and floorball were very limited.51 In fact, only six studies examined the effect of a 
preventive NMT on ACL reduction for handball202230 and basketball.232831 Unlike soccer, 
these other sports involve more upper body movements so that neuromuscular demands may 
be different than soccer. Hence, future investigations may need to focus on basketball, 
floorball, volleyball and handball athletes.
Conclusion
Current analyses found four variables to be significant predictors of ACL injury reduction in 
female athletes, and 73% of prophylactic effectiveness variability is explained by the four 
components. More precisely, 17% of ACL injury risk can be reduced if one of the four key 
variables met following conditions, which include that participants are younger, and NMT is 
performed longer than 20 min in duration and frequency greater than two times per week 
with more exercise variations within NMT along with usage of verbal feedback. Clinicians, 
experts and specialists in a field of sports medicine should consider the current study results 
when designing and implementing an ACL prevention NMT programme. Further 
investigations are necessary to determine the effects of the four key components on ACL 
injury reduction based on specific sporting activities.

 What are the findings?
•
Inception of one of the four critical components of neuromuscular training, 
which include younger age, greater neuromuscular dosage, more exercise 
variations within neuromuscular training and utilisation of verbal feedback, 
can reduce the risk of ACL injury by 17.2–17.7%.
•
The four key components can explain prophylactic effectiveness of 
neuromuscular training variability up to 73%.

 How might it impact on clinical practice in the future?
•
Neuromuscular training is an effective intervention to reduce ACL injury risk 
in physically active females.
•
The prophylactic effectiveness of neuromuscular training to reduce ACL 
injury risk is greater in young athletes.
•
There is an inverse dose–response association between compliance/dosage of 
neuromuscular training and ACL injury risk.
•
The more pronounced prophylactic effectiveness of neuromuscular training 
was obtained when a variety of exercises, particularly, strengthening and 
proximal control training, were performed with verbal feedback.

*Unless otherwise indicated. ‘C’ stands for control group and ‘I’ stands for intervention group.
†Although the study was a randomised controlled design, the follow-up rate was low (51.2%).
‡For the analysis purpose, only the 1st year intervention data was used.
§Although there was no specific statement, the neuromuscular training indicated plyometric components.
¶Although there were jump-landing manoeuvers, repeated stretch-shortening cycles were not employed in the training. Therefore, the level of evidence was rated as II.
