 Identification of Novel Urinary
Biomarkers for Predicting Renal
Prognosis in Patients With Type 2
Diabetes by Glycan Profiling
in a Multicenter Prospective
Cohort Study: U-CARE Study 1
https://doi.org/10.2337/dc18-0030
OBJECTIVE
Because quantifying glycans with complex structures is technically challenging,
little is known about the association of glycosylation profiles with the renal
prognosis in diabetic kidney disease (DKD).
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
In 675 patients with type 2 diabetes, we assessed the baseline urinary glycan signals
binding to 45 lectins with different specificities. The end point was a decrease of
estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) by ‡30% from baseline or dialysis for
end-stage renal disease.
RESULTS
During a median follow-up of 4.0 years, 63 patients reached the end point. Cox
proportional hazards analysis revealed that urinary levels of glycans binding to six
lectins were significantly associated with the outcome after adjustment for known
indicators of DKD, although these urinary glycans, except that for DBA, were highly
correlated with baseline albuminuria and eGFR. Hazard ratios for these lectins
were (+1 SD for the glycan index) as follows: SNA (recognizing glycan Siaa2-6Gal/
GalNAc), 1.42 (95% CI 1.14–1.76); RCA120 (Galb4GlcNAc), 1.28 (1.01–1.64); DBA
(GalNAca3GalNAc), 0.80 (0.64–0.997); ABA (Galb3GalNAc), 1.29 (1.02–1.64); Jacalin
(Galb3GalNAc), 1.30 (1.02–1.67); and ACA (Galb3GalNAc), 1.32 (1.04–1.67). Adding
these glycan indexes to a model containing known indicators of progression improved
prediction of the outcome (net reclassification improvement increased by 0.51 [0.22–
0.80], relative integrated discrimination improvement increased by 0.18 [0.01–0.35],
and the Akaike information criterion decreased from 296 to 287).
CONCLUSIONS
The urinary glycan profile identified in this study may be useful for predicting
renal prognosis in patients with type 2 diabetes. Additional investigation of gly-
cosylation changes and urinary glycan excretion in DKD is needed.

PATHOPHYSIOLOGY/COMPLICATIONS
 
Diabetes Care Publish Ahead of Print, published online June 21, 2018
 Several biomarkers have been demon-
strated to predict renal prognosis in pa-
tients with diabetes. Blood levels of tumor
necrosis factor receptors 1 and 2 are well-
known prognostic indicators for diabetic
kidney disease (DKD) (1,2). Similarly, markers
of tubulointerstitial injury, inflammation,
and filtration have been reported to pre-
dict the progression of DKD (3–6). These
biomarkers partly allow us to predict renal
prognosis at an early stage of DKD inde-
pendently of established clinical factors,
such as the estimated glomerular filtration
rate (eGFR) and albuminuria. However,
despite early detection of high-risk patients
and recent new protective treatments for
DKD (7–9), the management of patients
with DKD and rapid deterioration of renal
function remains difficult. Thus, new bio-
markers are needed to identify the path-
ogenesis of DKD and new therapeutic
targets.
The role of glycans and their enzymatic
modification (glycosylation) lately have
attracted much attention in relation to re-
search on cancer and metabolic diseases,
including diabetes and DKD. Ohtsubo et al.
(10) reported that human pancreatic
b-cell–specificGnT-4aglycosyltransferase,
which generates the core b1–4 GlcNAc
linkage in N-glycans, has a protective effect
against diabetes by increasing GLUT2 ex-
pression and maintaining insulin secretion.
Differences of glycosylation, including
O-GlcNAcylation, were reported to con-
tribute to the progression of DKD in rats
(11,12). There have been few reports
about differences of glycosylation in pa-
tients with DKD because of technical
obstacles to glycan analysis as a result
of the complicated structures of these
molecules and the time-consuming pro-
cesses required for mass spectrometry
(MS). However, the evanescent-field
fluorescence-assisted lectin microarray
that we reported previously enables high-
throughput quantification of glycan binding
to 45 specific lectins (13,14). In the pre-
liminary analysis of our previous study
(14), the urinary glycosylation pattern
varied considerably, whereas the changes
in serum glycosylation were barely detect-
able among patients with various kidney
diseases, including DKD, associated with
almost equivalent proteinuria and eGFR.
Moreover, studies of the serum N-glycan
profile have revealed that differences of
N-glycosylation are associated with dia-
betic complications and glycemic control in
patients with type 1 and 2 diabetes (15,16),
but the association between the urinary
glycosylation profile and renal prognosis
has not been investigated in patients with
diabetes to the best of our knowledge.
Accordingly, we investigated the re-
lationship between urinary excretion of
O- and N-glycans binding to 45 lectins
and the renal prognosis in patients with
type 2 diabetes. In addition, we assessed
the incremental predictive value of add-
ing promising glycans to a model that
contained established clinical variables,
including albuminuria and eGFR.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
Study Design
This prospective cohort study was initi-
ated in 2012. Among 688 patients with
type 2 diabetes admitted to eight hospitals
in Japan from June 2012 to March 2013,
675 patients were eligible for enrollment.
Exclusion criteria were a diagnosis of slowly
progressive type 1 diabetes during follow-
uporabaselineeGFR,15mL/min/1.73m2
(Supplementary Fig. 1). The diagnosis
of diabetes was based on Japanese Di-
abetes Society criteria (17). In addition,
134 volunteers who underwent medical
checkups at Okayama Health Foundation
in March 2016 and were confirmed to have
neither diabetes nor CKD (17,18) were
enrolled as control subjects to compare
differences in glycosylation. The protocol
for this study was approved by the ethics
committee of Okayama University Hospi-
tal in June 2012 (identification number:
H24-003). This study was registered with
the University Hospital Medical Informa-
tion Network in June 2012. Written in-
formed consent was obtained from all
patients with diabetes, whereas compre-
hensive anonymous consent was obtained
from control subjects.
Laboratory Parameters and Definitions
Urine samples collected in the early
morning and stored at baseline (patients
in 2012–2013, control subjects in 2016)
were used to measure urinary glycans
and urinary albumin levels in 2015–2016.
All specimens were aliquoted, stored
at 280°C until measurement, and thawed
for the first time to perform this study. The
average storage period until measurement
was 2.1 6 0.1 years for patients and 0.9 6
0.0 years for control subjects. As shown in
Supplementary Table 1, the influence of the
difference in frozen storage duration on
measurement of glycosylation is negligible.
Urinary glycans were measured by the
evanescent-field
fluorescence-assisted
lectin microarray, which is a new method
of glycan profiling (13,19–21). In brief, we
measured urinary levels of Cy3-labeled
glycoproteins that bound to 45 lectins
with different specificities, and urinary
glycan intensity can be measured in 300
samples in 3 working days (Supplementary
Fig. 2). Cy3 binds to primary amine in
principle. Urinary albumin was labeled by
Cy3, although it lacks glycan modification,
resulting in minimal background reactivity.
Urinary creatinine also was labeled by Cy3,
causing background reactivity like albu-
min. In preliminary experiments, both
urinary albumin and creatinine were
significantly associated with the inten-
sity of background reactivity (r between
log[urinary albumin concentration] and
log[background intensity (BG-I)] = 0.697,
r between log[urinary creatinine con-
centration (UCr)] and log[BG-I] = 0.166)
(Supplementary Fig. 3). We also ob-
served that the intensity of glycan re-
activity (glycan intensity) in 24-h urine
and spot urine samples was more closely
correlated with the net glycan intensity
(Net-I = raw glycan intensity [Raw-I] – BG-I)
than with the Net-I/UCr ratio or the Raw-I/
UCr ratio (mean 6 SD spot urine/24-h
urine Net-I ratio 1.20 6 0.74, Net-I/UCr
ratio 1.77 6 2.69, Raw-I/UCr ratio 1.68 6
2.00) (Supplementary Fig. 4). Furthermore,
comparison of glycan intensity between
original urine samples and 10-fold diluted
urine samples showed that all the Raw-I
ratios (ratio = original urine intensity/10-fold
diluted urine intensity) and most of the Net-I
ratios were ,10, suggesting that the uri-
nary glycan index did not increase linearly,
but quadratically (Supplementary Table 2).
On the basis of these results, we per-
formed all analyses by using the glycan
index appropriately transformed from
the Net-I according to its distribution.
GFR was estimated by using the Japa-
nese coefficient–modified Chronic Kidney
Disease Epidemiology Collaboration equa-
tion (22). The baseline urinary albumin/
creatinine ratio (UACR) in milligrams per
gram creatinine was measured in a spot
urine specimen, and normoalbuminuria,
microalbuminuria, and macroalbuminuria
were defined as UACR ,30, $30 and
,300, and $300 mg/gCr, respectively
(15). HbA1c data are presented as National
Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program
values according to the recommendations
of the Japanese Diabetes Society and the

Diabetes Care
 International Federation of Clinical Chem-
istry (23). BMI was calculated as weight in
kilograms divided by the square of height
in meters. Mean arterial pressure (MAP)
was calculated as two-thirds of diastolic
pressure plus one-third of systolic pressure
in millimeters of mercury. Hypertension
was defined as a baseline blood pressure
(BP) $140/90 mmHg or use of antihyper-
tensive drugs. The average annual values
of clinical parameters, including systolic BP
(SBP), diastolic BP (DBP), MAP, and HbA1c
plus the use of an ACE inhibitor (ACE-I) or
angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) during
follow-up were compared between all pa-
tients with and without outcome and those
stratified according to baseline eGFR cate-
gories. The grade of diabetic retinopathy
was determined by an ophthalmologist at
baseline (24). In this study, cardiovascular
disease (CVD), stroke, and peripheral arte-
rial disease (PAD) were defined as events
requiring admission for treatment, cerebral
bleeding or infarction requiring admission
for treatment, and PAD requiring admis-
sion for intervention or surgery, respec-
tively. Cardiovascular events were defined
as any CVD, stroke, or PAD event.
Study End Point
The primary study end point was defined
as a decrease of eGFR by at least 30%
from baseline or commencement of di-
alysis for end-stage renal disease (ESRD).
None of the patients received a kidney
transplant during follow-up.
Statistical Analysis
Data are summarized as percentages or
as the mean 6 SD, as appropriate. All
skewed variables were subjected to log-
transformation to improve normality be-
fore analysis. Correlations among glycan
indexes were evaluated by Pearson cor-
relation analysis. Univariate and multi-
variate linear regression analyses were
used to explore the association of urinary
glycan index with baseline HbA1c and age.
In both regression models, the depen-
dent variable was glycan index. In each
multivariate model, the b-coefficient for
HbA1c was adjusted for baseline age, sex,
and duration of diabetes, whereas the
b-coefficient for age was adjusted for sex
and duration of diabetes. The cumulative
incidence rate of the primary outcome
was estimated by Kaplan-Meier method
for urinary glycan quartiles in all patients,
and
incidence
rates
were
compared
with the log-rank test. In addition, we
compared Kaplan-Meier curves between
groups of patients with normoalbuminuria
or microalbuminuria stratified according to
urinary glycan quartiles (Q1–3 vs. Q4 or Q1
vs. Q2–4) and compared groups of patients
with macroalbuminuria and higher or
lower glycan indexes than the median
value.TheCoxproportionalhazardsmodel
was used to calculate the hazard ratio (HR)
and 95% CI for the death-censored end
point. In the multivariate model, HRs were
adjusted for age, sex, MAP, HbA1c, eGFR,
and log-transformed UACR at baseline.
These covariates were selected as potential
confounders on the basis of biological plau-
sibility and metabolic memory (25,26). We
also examined another multivariate model
without baseline HbA1c to evaluate the
effect of baseline HbA1c levels on the out-
come. Improvement in discriminating the
risk of the study outcome at the median
follow-up time (4.0 years) was assessed by
analysis of category-free net reclassifica-
tion improvement (NRI) and absolute/
relative integrated discrimination improve-
ment (IDI) as reported elsewhere (27–29).
The median follow-up time was selected
as the cutoff point for analysis because it
was previously used in similar biomarker
studies (3,30). We also used the Akaike
information criterion (AIC) to compare the
fit of various models. Moreover, we com-
pared Harrell’s concordance index (C index)
between multivariate Cox proportional
hazards models with or without glycan
biomarkers. The 95% CIs for category-
free NRI and IDI and the differences of
the C index were computed from 5,000
bootstrap samples to adjust for optimism
bias. Two-tailed P , 0.05 was considered
to indicate statistical significance. Analyses
and creation of graphs were performed
with Stata/SE version 14.0 (StataCorp) and
Origin version 2017 (OriginLab) software.
RESULTS
Follow-up Period and Incidence
of the Outcome
The median follow-up period was 4.0
years (interquartile range [IQR] 3.9–4.0
years).Duringfollow-up,theprimaryend
point occurred in 63 (9%) patients, and
12 (2%) patients died as a result of causes
other than ESRD after refusing dialysis or
transplantation.
Patient Characteristics
The baseline characteristics of the subjects
areshown in Table1. Theirmean 6SDage
was 63 6 11 years, 61% were men, and the
median known duration of diabetes was
11.0 years (IQR 6.2–17.7 years). The base-
line SBP, DBP, and MAP was 131.0 6 17.1,
74.8 6 10.9, and 93.5 6 11.7 mmHg,
respectively. One-third of the patients
had diabetic retinopathy (any type), and
their mean baseline HbA1c was 7.1 6 1.1%
(54.3 6 12.0 mmol/mol). In addition, the
mean baseline eGFR was 71.4 6 17.1 mL/
min/1.73 m2, and median UACR was 17.3
mg/gCr (IQR 7.8–71.1 mg/gCr); 594 pa-
tients had normoalbuminuria (64%) or mi-
croalbuminuria (24%). With respect to BP
and glycemic control during follow-up, the
average SBP, DBP, MAP, and HbA1c were
not significantly different between patients
with and without outcome. As well, the
useofanACE-IorARBduringfollow-upwas
not significantly different between the pa-
tients with and without outcome in groups
stratified according to baseline eGFR cate-
gories (Supplementary Table 3).
Associations of Urinary Glycan Index
with HbA1c and Age
Univariate and multivariate regression
analysis in all patients and patients with
baseline eGFR $60 mL/min/1.73 m2 re-
vealed that lower HbA1c was significantly
associated with glycan complex structures
that have higher GlcNAc [recognized by
PHA(L), PHA(E), DSA, LEL, STL, and WGA],
higher Siaa3Galb4GlcNAc (recognized by
MAL_I and ACG), higher GalNAcb4GlcNAc
(recognized by WFA), and higher
GalNAca3GalNAc (recognized by DBA),
whereas higher HbA1c was significantly
associated with higher Mana3Man (rec-
ognized by GNA). Most of these significant
associations were attenuated in the patients
with baseline eGFR ,60 mL/min/1.73 m2
(Supplementary Table 4). Similar regression
analysis for age showed that older age was
associated with higher Fuca2GalbGlcNAc
(recognized by UEA_I), higher (Galb4GlcNAc)n
(polylactosamine,recognizedbyLEL),higher
(GlcNAcb4MurNAc)n (peptidoglycan back-
bone, recognized by STL), and higher
Siaa3Galb3 (Siaa6) GalNAc (recognized
by MAH) (Supplementary Table 5).

 the renal outcome in the univariate Cox re-
gression model, whereas the urinary glycans
binding to six specific lectins (Sambucus
nigra [SNA], Ricinus communis [RCA120],
Dolichos biflorus [DBA], Agaricus bisporus
[ABA], Artocarpus integrifolia [Jacalin], and
Amaranthus caudatus [ACA]) were signifi-
cantly correlated with renal outcome in both
the univariate and multivariate models. In
the multivariate model adjusted for known
indicators of DKD progression, including
baseline eGFR and UACR, the HR for positive
glycan binding to SNA (+1 SD for the glycan
index) was 1.42 (95% CI 1.14–1.76), whereas
theHRforglycanbindingtoRCA120was1.28
(1.01–1.64); DBA, 0.80 (0.64–0.997); ABA,
1.29 (1.02–1.64); Jacalin, 1.30 (1.02–1.67);
and ACA, 1.32 (1.04–1.67) (Fig. 1A). These
associationsremainedlargelyunchanged
when average MAP and/or HbA1c during
follow-up were incorporated into the mul-
tivariate model and when baseline HbA1c
waseliminatedfromthemultivariatemodel
(Supplementary Tables 6 and 7). As shown
in Fig. 1B, the glycans Siaa2-6Gal/GalNAc,
Galb4GlcNAc, and GalNAca3GalNAc were
reported to bind with SNA, RCA120, and
DBA, respectively, whereas Galb3GalNAc
was reported to bind with ABA, Jacalin, and
ACA.
Glycan Binding to SNA, RCA120, DBA,
ABA, Jacalin, and ACA in the Control
Group and Patients With Diabetes
Stratified According to the CKD Heat
Map
We stratified the patients with diabe-
tes into four CKD heat map groups and
11 categories by using the baseline
UACR and eGFR (31). Comparisons of
glycan binding to SNA, RCA120, DBA,
ABA, Jacalin, and ACA among the control
group and patients with diabetes strat-
ified according to the CKD heat map
groups and 11 categories are shown in
Supplementary Fig. 5. Overall, the glycan
index values were higher in the severe
categories of the CKD heat map, albu-
minuria, and eGFR, except for the glycan
index of DBA. Of note, the glycan index
of SNA was significantly higher in the
green heat map group than in the con-
trol group, even though both groups
were defined by normoalbuminuria and
eGFR .60 mL/min/1.73 m2. Correlations
among positive binding to ABA, Jacalin,
and ACA were extremely strong (r =
0.952 between ABA and Jacalin, r = 0.931
between ABA and ACA, and r = 0.942
between ACA and Jacalin) as was the

Cumulative Incidence Rate of the
Primary Outcome in Urinary Glycan
Quartiles
Kaplan-Meier curves stratified according
to quartiles for baseline urinary glycan
binding to SNA, RCA120, DBA, ABA, Jacalin,
and ACA are shown in Fig. 2. The cumu-
lative incidence rate of the renal outcome
was significantly higher in the highest quar-
tile for urinary glycan binding to SNA,
RCA120, ABA, Jacalin, or ACA than in the
other quartiles, whereas it was significantly
higher in the lowest quartile for glycan
binding to DBA than in the other quartiles
(Fig. 2A). Similar results for glycans binding
to SNA, ABA, Jacalin, and ACA were ob-
tained in patients with normoalbuminuria/
microalbuminuria (Fig. 2B). Among patients
with macroalbuminuria, the cumulative
incidence rate was significantly higher
in those with higher than in those with
lower glycan index values, except in the
case of the glycan index for DBA (Fig. 2C).
Incremental Predictive Power of
Urinary Glycan Binding to SNA,
RCA120, DBA, ABA, Jacalin, and ACA
The category-free NRI, absolute/relative
IDI, and AIC for predicting the primary
outcome at the median follow-up time
(4.0 years) obtained by adding the glycan
indexes as well as the difference of the C
index between Cox regression models
with or without the urinary glycan in-
dexes are summarized in Table 2. The
addition of any single glycan index to the
multivariate model did not improve pre-
diction, whereas adding all six glycan
indexes significantly improved risk clas-
sification, integrated discrimination, and
AIC (category-free NRI 0.51 [95% CI 0.22–
0.80], relative IDI 0.18 [0.01–0.35], AIC
decrease 296–287). Similarly, when four
glycan indexes (on the basis of the re-
ported glycan specificities) were added,
risk classification, integrated discrimina-
tion, and AIC also were significantly im-
proved (Table 2). However, theC index did
not increase significantly when these gly-
can indexes were added to the multivar-
iate Cox regression model (Table 2).
CONCLUSIONS
Glycans are involved in various biological
processes, including development, immu-
nity, infection, hormone actions, cell ad-
hesion, and oncogenesis (19,32,33). One of
the most prominent features of glycans
is structural heterogeneity, and this distin-
guishes glycans from other major biopoly-
mers, such as nucleic acids and proteins.
Such heterogeneity is largely attribut-
able to the glycan fabrication process

 and depends on structural modification
by glycosyltransferases, which is known
as glycosylation (19).
Podocalyxin is the molecule in the
kidneys for which the functional effects
of changes in glycosylation have been
most thoroughly investigated (34). It is
a glycoprotein expressed by podocytes
that plays an essential role in the main-
tenance of podocyte slit pore integrity
and effective glomerular filtration (35).
Podocalyxin is decorated by O-glycans,
including an abundance of sialic acid, and
removal of sialic acid leads to efface-
ment of the podocyte foot processes and

the negative charge on the glomerular

doxycycline-induced global deficiency
of glycosyltransferase core 1 synthase
and glycoprotein-N-acetylgalactosamine

leads to marked reduction of SNA-binding

ing of the glomerular basement mem-

expression of mature O-glycans modified
byakeyglycosyltransferaseinthekidneys,
especially on podocytes, is crucial to
the maintenance of the normal renal
architecture. If abnormalities of renal
O-glycosylation occur, parts of mature
O-glycans could undergo reduction and
be excreted in the urine. Although C1galt1
isnotinvolvedinthemodificationofSiaa2-
6Gal/GalNAc (Supplementary Fig. 6A),
deletion of C1galt1 induces a decrease
of Siaa2-6Gal/GalNAc and an increase
of Tn antigen in mouse podocalyxin (37),
suggesting that impairment of one O-
glycosyltransferase also affects other
O-glycosylation pathways and leads to
the creation of abnormal O-glycans. The
current study findings might support
these suggestions as follows.
We found that urinary levels of glycans
binding to SNA, ABA, Jacalin, and ACA
were significantly higher in the severe
CKD heat map group and that the cu-
mulative incidence rate of the renal out-
come was significantly higher in the
highest glycan quartiles than in the other
glycan quartiles not only in all patients
but also in patients with normoalbumi-
nuria/microalbuminuria (Supplementary
Fig. 5 and Fig. 2A and B). Of note, urinary
excretion of Siaa2-6Gal/GalNAc binding
to SNA was significantly higher patients
with diabetes without CKD than in con-
trol subjects without diabetes and CKD,
suggesting that a change in the glycosyl-
ation of Siaa2-6Gal/GalNAc occurs in the
early stage of DKD before the onset of
albuminuria or detectable deterioration of
renal function. On the basis of these results
and the above-mentioned hypothesis that
changes of glycosylation lead to renal
structural damage, it might be reasonable
that indexes for these glycans may be
significantlyassociatedwiththeriskofthe
renal outcome independently of baseline
albuminuria and eGFR (Fig. 1).
Galb4GlcNAc binds to RCA120 and is
involved in N- and O-glycosylation. Dur-
ing O-glycosylation, Galb4GlcNAc plays
a role in the extension of cores 2 and 4,
which are finally modified by sialic acid
(32) (Supplementary Fig. 6A). Therefore,
if impairment of the enzyme adding sialic
acid to cores 2 and 4 exists, urinary
excretion of Galb4GlcNAc could increase
by the same mechanism as that which
increases urinary levels of Siaa2-6Gal/
GalNAc and Galb3GalNAc. In this study,
Figure 2—Cumulative incidence rate of the renal outcome. A: Cumulative incidence rate in all patients stratified by urinary glycan quartiles. The
estimated 4-year renal failure rate was 25%, 22%, 25%, 23%, and 26% in patients from the highest glycan quartiles for SNA, RCA120, ABA, Jacalin,
and ACA, respectively, whereas it was 15% in patients from the lowest glycan quartile for DBA. The cumulative incidence rate was significantly higher
in the highest glycan quartiles for SNA, RCA120, ABA, Jacalin, and ACA than in the other quartiles (P , 0.001), although it was significantly higher in
the lowest glycan quartile for DBA than in the other quartiles (P , 0.05). B: Cumulative incidence rate in the highest urinary glycan quartiles and
other glycan quartiles combined in patients with normoalbuminuria or microalbuminuria. The cumulative incidence rate was significantly higher in the
highest glycan quartile (Q4) for SNA, ABA, Jacalin, and ACA than in the other quartiles combined (Q1–3 vs. Q4: P = 0.026 for SNA, P = 0.028 for ABA,
P = 0.019 for Jacalin, and P = 0.002 for ACA). On the other hand, the difference of the cumulative incidence rate between Q4 and Q1–3 was not significant
for RCA120 and DBA (Q1–3 vs. Q4: P = 0.433 for RCA120, P = 0.270 for DBA). C: Cumulative incidence rate in patients with macroalbuminuria and
higher or lower glycan indexes than the median. The cumulative incidence rate was significantly higher in patients with higher glycan indexes than
in those with lower glycan indexes (P , 0.001), except for the glycan index for DBA (P = 0.186). Outcome: $30% decline of eGFR or dialysis as a result
of ESRD. The log-rank test was used for failure analysis.

 the glycan index for RCA120 was strongly
correlated with that for SNA (r = 0.921)
(Supplementary Table 8), which suggests
that the common underlying mechanism
is impairment of sialylation. In addition,
Ravid`
a et al. (12) demonstrated that
glycans binding to RCA120 gradually
show a significant decrease in the renal
cortex of diabetic rats with progression
of DKD, whereas these glycans increase
in nondiabetic rats. Therefore, increased
urinary levels of Galb4GlcNAc might re-
flect abnormal O-glycosylation in kidney
tissues.
With regard to GalNAca3GalNAc, we
could not reasonably explain why urinary
excretion of this glycan binding to DBA
was negatively correlated with the renal
outcome. DBA is well known for recog-
nizing the epitope of glycans on the
surface of type A red blood cells (33).

Novel Glycan Biomarkers of DKD
Diabetes Care
 It has also been reported to bind to
glomerular lesions in human DKD and
to the distal tubules in human kidney
tissue, but further investigations have
not been performed (38,39). DBA recog-
nizes core 5 (GalNAca3GalNAc), which
is a rare component of O-glycans, and the
relevant glycosyltransferase has not yet
beenreported(32).Therefore,additional
investigation of the role of this glycan in
the kidneys and DKD is needed.
Taken together, changes of glycosyla-
tion in DKD seem to be strongly associated
with renal prognosis because abnormal
glycosylation might be involved in the
progression of DKD. Supplementary Fig.
6 shows a scheme of our hypothesis re-
garding the mechanism by which abnor-
malities of glycosylation may be associated
with progression of DKD. We also speculate
that the urinary glycosylation difference
well reflects the local glycosylation changes
in kidney tissues rather than alterations of
systemic glycosylation on the basis of the
discrepancies of glycan profiles between
urine and serum/plasmasamples (15,16,40).
Serum protein N-glycan profiling has been
shown to lower levels of fucosylated bian-
tennary glycans, and higher levels of com-
plexes that have more GlcNAc and heavily
galactosylated and sialylated glycans have
been associated with higher HbA1c levels
in patients with diabetes (15,16), whereas
those associations were not observed in
the current urinary glycan profiling. Simi-
larly, plasma IgG N-glycan profiling revealed
that higher levels of bisecting GlcNAc and
lower levels of sialylation were correlated
with older age, especially .60 years (40),
whereas these results were not seen in the
current study with urine samples. In the
preliminary data of our previous study (14),
we found completely different glycosyla-
tion patterns between serum and urine
samples as well as different urinary glyco-
sylation among patients with biopsy-proven
kidney diseases, including DKD, and similar
degrees of proteinuria and eGFR, which
might support our speculation. These hy-
potheses are based on in vivo and clinical
studies of human DKD, so additional in-
vestigation of glycosylation changes in
human kidney tissue is required.
Potential limitations of this study were
that the current lectin microarray system
does not allow complete determination
of glycan structures as can MS, and un-
known preferred glycan structure to each
lectin might have biased the results.

 differentiating urinary glycan profiling in
individuals, and it enabled us to measure
a wide range of urinary glycan intensity in
high throughput without a liberation pro-
cess, although conventional methods, in-
cluding MS, require both prior liberation
and subsequent labeling (19). Another
limitation was that this study included
patients with various stages of CKD, and
renal biopsy was not performed in all
subjects. Therefore, we cannot exclude
the possibility that the decline of eGFR
in some patients resulted from kidney
diseases other than DKD. However, in
previous well-known cohort studies of
type 2 diabetes, DKD was not always con-
firmed by renal biopsy (1,3). Moreover, in
the patients with diabetes, renal biopsy
isconsideredwhenhematuria,granularcasts,
sudden onset of nephrotic syndrome, and
rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis are
indicated, whereas such conditions were
not observed during follow-up in the current
study. We hope that an ongoing research
biopsy study of DKD at our institution will
solve this issue in the future.
In conclusion, we demonstrate that
urinary excretion of glycans binding to
several lectins, including SNA (recognizing
Siaa2-6Gal/GalNAc), RCA120 (Galb4GlcNAc),
DBA (GalNAca3GalNAc), ABA, Jacalin, and
ACA (Galb3GalNAc), are significantly asso-
ciated with renal outcome in patients with
type 2 diabetes. The addition of the com-
bined glycan index to a model with stan-
dard risk factors significantly improves
prediction of renal outcome, suggesting
that these urinary glycans are novel pre-
dictors of renal prognosis in patients with
type 2 diabetes. The findings could pro-
vide new insights into changes of glyco-
sylation related to DKD. The mechanisms
that underlie differences of urinary glycan
excretion and changes of glycosylation in
DKD should be investigated further.
