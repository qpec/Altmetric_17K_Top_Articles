Abstract
Background: It has been posited that the consumption of extra protein (> 0.8 g/kg/d) may be deleterious to
bone mineral content. However, there is no direct evidence to show that consuming a high-protein diet
results in a demineralization of the skeleton. Thus, the primary endpoint of this randomized controlled trial
was to determine if a high-protein diet affected various parameters of whole body and lumbar bone mineral
content in exercise-trained women.
Methods: Twenty-four women volunteered for this 6-month investigation (n = 12 control, n = 12 high-protein).
The control group was instructed to consume their habitual diet; however, the high-protein group was
instructed to consume ≥2.2 g of protein per kilogram body weight daily (g/kg/d). Body composition was
assessed via dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Subjects were instructed to keep a food diary via the
mobile app MyFitnessPal®. Exercise or activity level was not controlled. Subjects were asked to maintain their
current levels of exercise.
Results: During the 6-month treatment period, there was a significant difference in protein intake between
the control and high-protein groups (mean±SD; control: 1.5±0.3, high-protein: 2.8±1.1 g/kg/d); however, there
were no differences in the consumption total calories, carbohydrate or fat. Whole body bone mineral density
did not change in the control (pre: 1.22±0.08, post: 1.22±0.09 g/cm2) or high-protein group (pre: 1.25±0.11,
post: 1.24±0.10 g/cm2). Similarly, lumbar bone mineral density did not change in the control (pre: 1.08±0.16,
post: 1.05±0.13 g/cm2) or high-protein group (pre: 1.07±0.11, post: 1.08±0.12 g/cm2). In addition, there were
no changes in whole body or lumbar T-Scores in either group. Furthermore, there were no changes in fat
mass or lean body mass.
Conclusion: Despite an 87% higher protein intake (high-protein versus control), 6 months of a high-protein
diet had no effect on whole body bone mineral density, lumbar bone mineral density, T-scores, lean body
mass or fat mass.

Background
It is has been postulated that high protein consumption
(i.e., > RDA) poses several health risks. These could in-
clude renal dysfunction as well as bone demineralization
[1]. However, there is evidence that consuming a high-
protein diet for one year has no negative effect on
kidney or liver function [2]. Whether it is also true that
bone health is not compromised by a high-protein diet is
not entirely certain according to health care professionals.
Much of the purported harm caused by dietary protein
with regards to bone is often explained via the acid-ash
hypothesis. The acid-ash diet hypothesis suggests that
acid from a typical Western diet may cause bone
demineralization with the
consequent excretion of
calcium [3]. This in turn may lead to osteoporosis.
Thus, protein-containing foods (e.g., meat) provide acid
precursors, whereas vegetables (protein) provide base
precursors not found in animal foods. However, in one
investigation, bone mineral density was not associated
with the ratio of animal to vegetable protein intake [4].
Interestingly, 12 weeks of resistance training did not

 enhance bone formation or inhibit bone resorption in
young adult women; subsequently, maintenance of a
high protein intake for 10 days in these women also
demonstrated no effects on bone metabolism [5]. Ob-
servational data suggests that a higher protein intake
does not adversely affect bone health in premenopausal
women; however, low vegetable protein intake is associ-
ated with lower BMD [6]. There are no investigations
in exercise-trained women that have examined the
effects of a chronic high-protein diet. Thus, the primary
purpose of this investigation was to determine if
consuming extra protein (≥ 2.2 g/kg/d) affected bone
mineral content or density in exercise-trained women.
Methods
Participants
Twenty-four
exercise-trained
female
subjects
volun-
teered for this investigation (i.e., had to be performing a
minimum of resistance- and/or aerobic-training sessions
three times per week for at least the last year). Subjects
came to the laboratory on two occasions for testing
(baseline and 6 months post). In accordance with the
Helsinki Declaration, the university’s Institutional Re-
view Board approved all human subjects procedures.
Written informed consent was obtained prior to partici-
pation. All testing took place between 1130 and 1400 h.
Body composition
Subjects had their height and weight determined using a
calibrated scale. Body composition (i.e., was assessed with
a dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry machine (DXA)
(Model: Hologic Horizon W; Hologic Inc., Danbury CT
USA). Quality control calibration procedures were per-
formed on a spine phantom. Subjects wore typical athletic
clothing and removed all metal jewelry. They were posi-
tioned supine on the DXA within the borders delineated
by the scanning table. Each whole body scan took approxi-
mately seven minutes. In addition, a lumbar spine scan
was performed. Subjects were positioned supine on the
scanning table with their legs resting on a pad that allowed
them to have their knee and hip joint at a 90-degree angle.
The lumbar scan took approximately 15 s.
Diet and exercise
Subjects were randomly assigned to a control or high-
protein group. The control group was instructed to
maintain their habitual diet. The high-protein group was
instructed to consume ≥ 2.2 g/kg/d of protein. Subjects
had the choice of consuming more protein via their
typical diet (i.e., eat more protein-containing foods) or
the consumption of protein powder. Dymatize® provided
whey and casein protein powder whereas vegan protein
powder was provided by MusclePharm®. Subjects were
also instructed to keep a food log (three times per week)
on the MyFitnessPal mobile app. All subjects had prior
experience using the mobile app and as such were quite
skilled at logging their food intake. The subjects’ training
regimen was not altered in any way; thus, each subject
self-selected their exercise regimen.
Statistical analysis
An analysis of variance was used to assess differences
between the control and treatment group for measures
of bone health and body composition. A paired and in-
dependent t-test were utilized to assess any main effects
of condition, groups or significant interactions. All data
is presented as the mean±SD. Prism 6 software was used
for statistical analyses.
Results
Twenty-four exercise-trained women completed this
investigation (mean±SD. Age years: control 36.0±9.5,
high-protein 37.3±8.9; Height cm: control 167.5±10.1,
high-protein 167.5±5.1). Each subject in the high-protein
diet group increased their protein intake primarily via
the protein powder that was provided. The majority of
our subjects performed both aerobic and resistance exer-
cises 1–3 h per week (i.e., 44–48% of the subjects)
(Table 1); however, there was a subset of subjects (36%)
that performed a high volume of aerobic training (> 7 h
per week). All subjects performed aerobic exercise regu-
larly; however, 12% did not do any resistance training.
Moreover, the types of athletes in the study were as
follows.
The
control
group
was
comprised
of:
1
world-class distance runner, 4 competitive (state-level)
stand-up paddlers, and 7 resistance-trained women.
The high-protein group was comprised of: 1 national
class distance runner, 1 world-class stand-up paddler,
4 competitive (state-level) stand-up paddlers, 1 com-
petitive cyclist (state-level), and 5 resistance-trained
women.
There was a significant difference between the high-
protein and control group for daily protein intake
(Table 2). Even though the total daily caloric intake of
the high-protein group exceeded the control by ~ 226
kcals, it was not significantly different (p = 0.1710); fur-
thermore, no other differences existed regarding their
dietary intake. Moreover, there were no within- or
between-group differences in any measure of bone
health or body composition (Tables 3 and 4).

 Discussion
This is the first investigation to examine the effects
of
a
chronic
high-protein
diet
(2.8
g/kg/d)
in
exercise-trained women. In the current study, the
high-protein group consumed 87% more protein than
the
control.
The
~ 226
kcal
difference
in
energy
intake (high-protein > control) is largely due to the
increase in protein consumption. It should be noted
that the high-protein group exhibited a wide variation
in intake (mean±SD 169±55 g/daily). This was largely due
to one subject that consumed in excess of 4 g/kg/d of pro-
tein. Nevertheless, in spite of a significantly higher protein
intake, there were no changes in bone mineral density,
bone mineral content (i.e., whole body, lumbar spine) or
T-score. There have been other investigations that have
made direct measures of bone health after the consump-
tion of a higher protein diet. Kenny et al. evaluated the
effect of a 1-year treatment that consisted of dietary soy
protein and/or soy isoflavones on bone health in late post-
menopausal women [7]. They found that neither soy
protein nor isoflavones (in combination or alone) had any
effect on BMD. It should be noted that the protein intake
from that study was actually quite low (~ 0.9 g/kg/d) [7].
Ballard et al. conducted a 6-month investigation on pro-
tein supplementation and bone health [8]. They discov-
ered that additional protein had no effect on BMD or
bone size in young adults (18–25 years). It should be
noted that the protein intake of the subjects in the
Ballard et al. investigation was quite low as well (1.0–
1.2 g/kg/d). Moreover, in older women and men (>
60 years), whey protein supplementation (total daily
protein intake of 1.0–1.1 g/kg/d) had no effect on
bone mass; however, it did increase truncal lean mass
after an 18-month treatment period [9].
It must be acknowledged that the protein intake of the
aforementioned studies was quite low. Athletes or indi-
viduals that exercise regularly are often advised to con-
sume at least twice the recommended daily allowance
(RDA) of protein [10–14]. The protein intake in our in-
vestigation was 1.5 and 2.8 g/kg/d for the control and
high-protein groups. It should be emphasized that the
protein intake from our control group exceeded those of
other studies [7–9]. So perhaps in order to observe a
change in bone parameters, a much higher dose is
needed. Our high-protein group consumed protein at a
dose 2.5 times greater than the RDA. Thus, if there were
a deleterious effect of protein consumption, one would
reasonably expect to see this at such a high dose. On the
contrary, our investigation found no effect on bone
mineral content or density.
This is in agreement with other studies that have
utilized moderate to high protein intakes. Cao et al. pro-
vided post-menopausal women with a diet of 1.7 g/kg/d
of protein for 7 weeks and found no adverse effects on
bone health [15]. Ballard had young (18–25 years) sub-
jects consume 2.2 g/kg/d of protein over a 6-month
treatment period [8]. Although they did not measure
bone mass directly, they discovered that biomarkers for
bone formation were elevated (e.g., IGF-1). Moreover, in
the presence of high calcium intake, consuming a high-
protein diet (2.5 g/kg/d) for one month in hyperlipid-
emic men and women (56 years) did not have a negative

 effect on calcium balance [16]. However, the treatment
period was rather short and they did not make any dir-
ect measures of bone mass.
Our investigation is the first to use exercise-trained
women. This is significant in that it is exercise-trained
individuals that purposefully consume a higher protein
diet [2, 10, 11, 13, 17–23]. Sedentary individuals do not
typically consume a high-protein diet. And it is clear
that a very high intake of protein (2.5 x greater than the
RDA) does not have a negative effect on bone mineral
content or density.
Another interesting find in our investigation was
that despite consuming more calories per day, the
high-protein group did not experience a change in fat
mass. This supports work from other investigations
[10, 24–26]. In fact, when combined with a change in
training, a higher protein diet can promote a loss of
fat mass [10]. It is unclear why fat mass might de-
crease in response to protein overfeeding combined
with a change in one’s training program. Perhaps it is
non-exercise activity thermogenesis or diet-induced
thermogenesis
with
increased
protein
consumption
[27, 28]. Also, animal data suggests that a high-pro-
tein diet might reduce fat mass by inhibiting lipogenesis in
the liver [29]. Nevertheless, the current investigation dem-
onstrated that body composition as well as bone mass
does not change unless in the absence of alterations in the
exercise stimulus.
It should be noted that the total energy intake of our
subjects seemed rather low for active individuals. For
instance, the control and high-protein groups con-
sumed on average 1580 and 1877 cal per day. A simple
estimation of basal metabolic rate using the Harris
Benedict equation would suggest that at minimum
these individuals should be consuming greater than
2000 cal per day [30]. Thus, it is likely that our subjects
were underreporting total energy intake, particularly
from carbohydrate and fat. It is however plausible that
protein intake was more accurately estimated inasmuch
as subjects derived the added protein from protein
powder sources. Nonetheless, despite the drawbacks of
using dietary records, it is evident that extra protein
supplementation has no harmful effect on bone mineral
content or density.
Conclusion
In conclusion, exercise-trained female subjects that con-
sume a diet that is 2.5 times greater than the RDA for
protein experience no harmful effects on bone mineral
density or content. Thus, there is no evidence that a
high protein intake causes harm to bone health.
