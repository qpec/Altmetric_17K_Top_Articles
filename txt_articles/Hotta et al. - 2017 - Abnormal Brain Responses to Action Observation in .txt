Abstract: Patients with complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) display various abnormalities in
central motor function, and their pain is intensified when they perform or just observe motor actions.
In this study, we examined the abnormalities of brain responses to action observation in CRPS. We
analyzed 3-T functional magnetic resonance images from 13 upper limb CRPS patients (all female,
ages 31–58 years) and 13 healthy, age- and sex-matched control subjects. The functional magnetic
resonance imaging data were acquired while the subjects viewed brief videos of hand actions shown
in the first-person perspective. A pattern-classification analysis was applied to characterize brain
areas where the activation pattern differed between CRPS patients and healthy subjects. Brain areas
with statistically significant group differences (q < .05, false discovery rate-corrected) included the
hand representation area in the sensorimotor cortex, inferior frontal gyrus, secondary somatosensory
cortex, inferior parietal lobule, orbitofrontal cortex, and thalamus. Our findings indicate that CRPS
impairs action observation by affecting brain areas related to pain processing and motor control.
Perspective: This article shows that in CRPS, the observation of others’ motor actions induces
abnormal neural activity in brain areas essential for sensorimotor functions and pain. These results
build the cerebral basis for action-observation impairments in CRPS.

C
omplex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) manifests
with pain, hyperesthesia, allodynia, edema, and
motor, vasomotor, and sudomotor symptoms in a
limb. It is a disabling disorder without effective treat-
ment. Because the pathophysiology is incompletely
understood and definitive biomarkers are lacking, the
diagnosis is based on a set of symptoms and signs27-29
and
thus
also
faced
with
criticism
for
being
unspecific.4,14,43,50,53
More
thorough
understanding
of
pathophysiological
mechanisms
is
needed
for
development
of
biomarkers
and
eventually
better
treatments for CRPS.
The current concept of CRPS pathophysiology is
multifaceted. In addition to peripheral mechanisms
(inflammation and vasomotor dysfunction), the central
nervous system is essentially involved in the disease
process.6,44
The central contribution is manifested especially in the
peculiar motor characteristics of CRPS. For example, pa-
tients need exaggerated effort to perform movements
with the painful limb23 and even imagined movements

 can be abnormally slow.57 The movement-related pain
and swelling are decreased when patients see their
limb
in
a
smaller
size,
whereas
these
symptoms
increase when the limb image is magnified.46 If the
patients do not see the limb, the sense of position38
and the performance of simple motor tasks22 are
impaired. It has been suggested that such symptoms
can
discriminate
CRPS
from
other
chronic
pain
disorders.22,27,29 The central mechanisms underscoring
these manifestations can be assessed using modern
functional neuroimaging.
Intriguingly,
not
only
movements,15,64
but
also
motor imagery,47 or just observing motor actions31
aggravate pain in CRPS. In healthy persons, action
observation is known to affect brain areas that support
the actual performance of such actions (for a review
of
motor
mirroring,
see
Rizzolatti
and
Fogassi54).
Because
the
brain’s
motor
circuitry
is
activated
abnormally in CRPS patients,40 brain responses to
action observation might expose novel pathophysiology
in CRPS.
We thus performed functional magnetic resonance
(MR) imaging (fMRI) on upper limb CRPS type 1 patients
and a control group of healthy adults who viewed hand
actions in videos. To effectively reveal abnormalities of
brain responses to action observation, we applied
pattern
classification
analysis
(searchlight
classifica-
tion).36 This approach provides detailed information
about brain sites where responses to action observation
differ between patients and control subjects.
Methods
Subjects
We identified 96 patients with CRPS from the patient
registry of the Pain Clinic at the Helsinki University Hospi-
tal. In addition, nearby hospitals referred to us 19 pa-
tients to be included in the study. From this pool of
patients, we found 17 right-handed upper limb CRPS
type 1 patients (16 female, 1 male), who met our study
criteria given in Fig 1A; the gender imbalance likely re-
flects the 3 to 4 times higher incidence of CRPS in female
than in male individuals.16,55 The patient selection
process is described in more detail in Fig 1B. The control
group comprised 20 right-handed healthy adults (19
female, 1 male) recruited primarily using e-mail adver-
tisements. From this subject sample, 1 healthy control
subject was excluded because of an incidental exclusive
MR abnormality. As an additional inclusion criterion,
we required alertness during the recording: on the basis
of continuous online eye-tracking during the whole MR
scanning, 13 patients (76.5%) and 15 healthy control sub-
jects (78.9%) were sufficiently alert to be included in the
analysis (for details, see the Supplementary Text). Finally,
to match the group size for classification, we selected 13
alert control subjects, optimized to match the patients
for sex and age, as well as for the MR scanner used
(because of a scanner change in the middle of the study).
The recruitment and MR scanning took place between
January 1, 2011 and January 30, 2013.
All
the
analyzed
subjects
were
female
with
a
mean 6 SD age of 44.7 6 6.9 years (range = 31–58 years)
in the patient group and 44.1 6 8.6 years (range = 29–
58 years) in the control group. Three patients had a diag-
nosis of migraine but otherwise none of the subjects had
diagnoses of chronic neurological or psychiatric diseases.
The control subjects reported no ongoing or long-lasting
pain.
Figure 1. Patient selection. (A) Inclusion and exclusion criteria
for the CRPS patients. (B) Patients were recruited primarily from
the Pain Clinic at the Helsinki University Hospital where we
searched the records from year 2007 to 2013 for patients with
a diagnosis of CRPS. In addition, we requested eligible patients
from other pain clinics, mainly in Uusimaa district. Of the 115 pa-
tients initially considered as possible subjects according to their
diagnosis, 35 were eligible and were clinically examined by an
experienced neurologist with a subspecialty in pain medicine.
From this sample, 17 patients fulfilled the study criteria and
participated in the fMRI experiment. Eventually, 13 patients pre-
sented sufficient alertness during the scan to be included in the
analysis.

The Journal of Pain
Action Observation in CRPS
 The sensory, vasomotor, sudomotor/edema, and mo-
tor/trophic diagnostic categories of CRPS29 were evalu-
ated
by
an
experienced
neurologist
with
a
subspecialty in pain medicine (see Table 1 for detailed
information
of
patients’
clinical
and
demographic
data). All patients fulfilled ‘‘the clinical criteria for
CRPS’’ and all but 1 patient (P13) also fulfilled the
more stringent criteria ‘‘for research purposes’’ as
defined in ‘‘the Budapest criteria.’’29 The CRPS symp-
toms were unilateral (right-side affected in 10 patients
and left side in 3), and had begun 5.2 6 3.9 years ago
(range = 1.5–15.5 years).
The study was approved by the Ethics Committee,
Department of Medicine of the Helsinki and Uusimaa
Hospital District and conducted according to the Declara-
tion of Helsinki. The subjects signed an informed consent
before participation.
Experimental Design
During fMRI scanning, the subjects viewed the same
3.2-second video clips of hand actions that we applied
in our previous study in which the stimuli appeared un-
pleasant and even painful for the patients to observe.31
In the current experiment, the video clips were shown
in 4-clip blocks (Fig 2). Each of the 48 blocks contained
videos of hand actions in 1 of 3 possible categories:
either left or right hand remaining static (STATIC condi-
tion), repeating gentle movements of opening and
closing the fist (FIST), or squeezing an object with
maximum force (SQUEEZE; the squeezed objects are
presented in Supplementary Fig 1). The subjects were
instructed to view the videos without imagining the
observed hand movements; their performance on this
task was not controlled. In addition, it was emphasized
that the hands should be kept still during the stimuli.
After the scanning, the subjects evaluated their alert-
ness in the beginning, middle, and end of the scanning
session on an 11-point numeric rating scale from 0 (very
tired) to 10 (very alert).
To familiarize the subjects with the hand actions,
before scanning we asked them to perform the actions
and then view the video stimuli (for the protocol details,
see Hotta et al31). The stimuli were shown in condition-
wise blocks, and after each block, the subjects rated their
level of pain and valence during the observation on the
11-point numeric rating scale (pain: 0 = no pain,
10 = extreme pain; valence: 0 = very pleasant, 5 = neutral,
10 = very unpleasant). Fig 3 shows these ratings
(mean 6 standard error of the mean) and illustrates
how the unpleasantness increased in order of observing
STATIC, FIST, and SQUEEZE stimuli for the patients; all
these patients’ data (except for 1 patient) were included
in our earlier publication comprising altogether 19 CRPS
type 1 patients and 19 healthy control subjects.31
fMRI Data Acquisition
The fMRI data were acquired at the Advanced Mag-
netic Imaging Centre of Aalto NeuroImaging, Aalto Uni-
versity School of Science, 2 to 27 days (mean 13 6 6 SD
days) after the recruitment, using 2 MR scanners (because
of scanner change in the middle of the study). Nine pa-
tients and 9 control subjects were scanned with a Signa

Figure 2. The stimulus protocol and the block structure. (A) The stimuli comprised 48 blocks of hand-action videos presented in a
semirandomized order. Each block had 4 video clips of the same female hand performing movements in 1 of the 3 action categories
(STATIC, FIST, or SQUEEZE). Four different presentation orders for the blocks were randomized across the subjects. Blocks for left and
right hand always alternated. Every third block was always of the STATIC category, and in between, FIST and SQUEEZE blocks were
presented randomly. Blocks lasted for 15.5 to 16.7 seconds, with a 2.85- to 3.25-second interblock interval. (B) Each block comprised
4 different 3.2-second video clips of female hand actions, with .9- to 1.3-second interclip intervals. Altogether, 8 such clips were
included for each action category and each clip presented the hand from a slightly different angle in the first-person view. Each
clip was presented 4 times during the experiment. The order of the video clips within a block was randomized.

Action Observation in CRPS
 Drowsiness was monitored by following eye closures
with an eye-tracker (iView X MRI-LR, SensoMotoric In-
struments GmbH, Germany, in the GE scanner; EyeLink
1000, SR Research Ltd, Ontario, Canada, in the Siemens
scanner). Moreover, the subjects’ hand movements
were monitored with 2 custom-made MR-compatible ac-
celerometers attached to fingers 3 through 5 of both
hands (data collected using BrainAmp ExG MR ampli-
fiers; Brain Products GmbH, Munich, Germany).
fMRI Preprocessing and General Linear
Model
The fMRI data were preprocessed and normalized to
the anatomical Montreal Neurological Institute space us-
ing SPM8 software (http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk). The
fMRI preprocessing included slice-time correction, mo-
tion correction, smoothing (6-mm full-width at half-
maximum isotropic Gaussian kernel), coregistration of
the skull-stripped functional images (using the mean im-
age) with corresponding T1 images, and normalization
of data to the Montreal Neurological Institute anatom-
ical space using the Colin template (http://www.bic.
mni.mcgill.ca/ServicesAtlases/Colin27). The normalized
voxel size was 3.75 � 3.75 � 3 mm3. Finally, a high-pass
filter (cutoff at .01 Hz) was applied to remove low-
frequency signal drifts.
The general linear model (GLM) was used to estimate
the level of brain activation (b-values) for each of the 6
observation conditions (STATIC, FIST, and SQUEEZE, sepa-
rately for left and right hands). In the GLM, the time
courses of the 6 conditions were modeled as boxcar func-
tions
convolved
with
the
canonical
hemodynamic
response function. To reduce movement-related effects
in the 6 b-values, the estimated movement parameters
(3 translations and 3 rotations) were included as nuisance
regressors in the GLM. Multivariate group analyses were
limited to gray matter using the corresponding SPM8
mask (http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk), resulting in 32,868
analyzed voxels.
Multivariate Analysis
We trained a set of classifiers to find brain activity pat-
terns that would discriminate CRPS patients from the
control group. We used the searchlight method36 that
bases classification of fMRI data on activity patterns in
spherical volumes; in this study we used volumes of 123
adjacent voxels, corresponding to a sphere of 7 voxels
(approximately 2.1 cm) in diameter, if not cropped
smaller by the gray matter mask. In the searchlight pro-
cedure, each gray matter voxel acts once as a center voxel
of such sphere (ie, ‘‘searchlight’’), resulting in spatial
maps of classification accuracies assigned to the center
voxels. In other words, the multivariate pattern analysis
with the searchlight method provides information about
where in the brain and with what probability (accuracy)
the local brain responses differ between subject groups.
Statistical Analysis
GLM b-value contrasts (Table 2), 1 for each voxel,
were used as classification features. The classification
accuracies were calculated with leave-2-subjects-out
cross-validation so that 1 patient and 1 control subject
were left out (altogether 13 � 13 = 169 patient-
control pairs) for testing, with the classifier trained
by the data of the remaining 24 subjects. In each
voxel, the final classification accuracy was the percent-
age of correct classifications over all 169 patient-
control pairs.
We classified 7 different b-value contrasts separately
(STATIC, FIST, SQUEEZE, FIST – STATIC, SQUEEZE – STATIC,
SQUEEZE – FIST, and PAIN – NO-PAIN; Table 2). Support
vector machine was used with the regularization para-
meter C = 162 as implemented in the PyMVPA toolbox
(http://www.pymvpa.org).26
The
statistical
significance
of the classification performance was estimated using
permutation testing49 separately for each searchlight
(n = 32,868): the null-distributions for the classification ac-
curacies were estimated by randomly permuting the
labels (patient/control) before the cross-validation proced-
ure 5,000 times.
The P values derived from the estimated null distribu-
tion
were
corrected
for
multiple
comparisons
(n = 32,868) using false discovery rate24 with q < .05.

NOTE. For the group analyses, 7 different b-value contrasts were calculated indi-
vidually. In the table, the first column presents the contrast name. Columns 2 to 7
indicate the stimuli for which b-values were summed (1) or subtracted (–) for
each contrast. First, to study the effects of each action category (regardless of
the presented hand), the category-specific sum of b-values for left and right
hand stimuli were computed for each of 1) STATIC, 2) FIST, and 3) SQUEEZE cat-
egories. These plain contrasts are represented in the first 3 rows of the table. Sec-
ond, to highlight the differences between action categories (regardless of the
presented hand), the category-specific sum of b-values for left and right hand
stimuli were subtracted pairwise between categories 4) SQUEEZE – STATIC, 5)
SQUEEZE – FIST, and 6) FIST – STATIC contrasts. Third, to study whether patients
respond abnormally to observing hands corresponding to their affected hand, the
sum of b-values for stimuli presenting the healthy-sided hand was subtracted
from the sum of b-values for stimuli presenting the hand of the affected side:
7) PAIN – NO-PAIN contrast (in the table, the contrast weights are for patients
with affected right side). For each age-matched control subject, corresponding
hand-matched calculations were performed.
*For the patients with affected left side (and the corresponding control subjects),
contrast weights were of opposite signs.

 statistically significant (q < .05, false discovery rate-
corrected) in 7 distinct and lateralized brain regions.
The most notable regions were the right pars triangu-
laris (mainly Brodmann area 45) in the inferior frontal
gyrus, the right secondary somatosensory cortex, the
right supramarginal gyrus in the inferior parietal
lobule, and the middle and superior frontal gyri (sup-
plementary motor area) in the left hemisphere (for
detailed information about brain regions, cytoarchi-
tectonic areas, coordinates, and classification accu-
racies, see Table 3).
Fig 5 shows the corresponding classification perfor-
mance for the SQUEEZE – STATIC contrast. Statistically
significant classifications were observed in 7 separate re-
gions, the most prominent one in the left sensorimotor
hand area (the hand knob68). One notable region
covered large parts of the right thalamus (extending
also to the caudate), whereas another region was
located in the right middle orbitofrontal gyrus (for
detailed information, see Table 3).
For the other plain contrasts (STATIC, FIST), as well as
for the other contrasts addressing differences between
conditions (SQUEEZE – FIST, FIST – STATIC) or between
observed hands (PAIN – NO-PAIN), statistically significant
classifications were much less frequent (by a factor of
3–10 compared with SQUEEZE or SQUEEZE – STATIC
contrasts), but the accuracies were still high, ranging
from 86 to 98% (for details, see Supplementary Table 1).
Patients With Right-Sided Symptoms
Because some brain changes in chronic pain patients
depend on the affected side (see Vartiainen et al,63 for
example), the searchlight classifications were also per-
formed with a subgroup of patients with right-hand
pain (n = 10) and their optimally matched control sub-
jects (n = 10).
In this subject sample, the searchlight analysis pro-
duced statistically significant classifications mainly for
the SQUEEZE – STATIC contrast (accuracies from 91–
100%). Most of these successful classifications were in
the same regions as for the original groups of 13 subjects,
that is, in the left sensorimotor hand area and the right
middle orbitofrontal gyrus. As for the other contrasts,
the most notable classification accuracies appeared for
the PAIN – NO-PAIN contrast in the supplementary motor
area and adjacent middle cingulate gyrus. For details, see
Supplementary Table 2 and Supplementary Fig 2.
Confounding Factors
To rule out spurious findings, we also performed pa-
tient versus control classification using features from
head movements, hand movements, and measures of
alertness (for details, see the Supplementary File). This
analysis resulted in a statistically significant classification
accuracy of 70% (P = .045; lower bound of statistical sig-
nificance
=
69.5%).

12 control subjects) and the remaining subjects (1 patient, 1 control) were considered as patients or control subjects depending on

Action Observation in CRPS
 Wilcoxon tests (P < .05, Bonferroni-corrected) did not
show factorwise differences between the groups.
Discussion
In fMRI recordings performed during action observa-
tion, CRPS patients displayed abnormal brain responses.
The abnormalities were most robust for videos showing
object manipulation with high force (SQUEEZE) that, ac-
cording to our previous study,31 is perceived as unpleas-
ant or even painful in CRPS patients. For these videos,
the pattern classification revealed group differences in
parts of the action observation network (inferior frontal
gyrus and inferior parietal lobule; for a review, see Cas-
pers et al10), and in areas related to pain perception (sec-
ondary
somatosensory
cortex)
or
motor
control
(supplementary motor area). Also, the contrast between
the brain responses to the most unpleasant and to the
least unpleasant stimuli (SQUEEZE – STATIC) revealed
notable group differences. These differences appeared
mainly in pain-responsive brain areas (primary sensori-
motor cortex and thalamus) and in the orbitofrontal cor-
tex, an area likely participating in pain modulation.52,66
With the SQUEEZE contrast, the most prominent group
differences were in the right inferior frontal gyrus, an
area included in a frontal network that mediates effects
of attention, expectations, and reappraisal during pain
perception.67 Lamm et al37 proposed, in an fMRI study
addressing empathy for pain in healthy subjects, that
the right inferior frontal gyrus inhibits aversive responses
during observation of painful situations. More generally,
the right inferior frontal gyrus is known to participate in
motor and cognitive inhibition (for details, see a recent
meta-analysis39). Subjects in both groups kept their
hands still as instructed (see Supplementary File), and
such immobility during action observation requires sup-
pression of automatic imitation.12,30 Taken together,
our findings in the right inferior frontal gyrus might
reflect group differences in the salience and quality of
inhibited responses to action observation. Because of
unpleasantness of SQUEEZE stimuli for the patients, a
dysfunctional inhibition related to aversive associations
with motor actions might also explain the activation
differences. Such dysfunction could be an important
pathophysiological mechanism explaining many central
nervous system-related features of CRPS.

 Of special importance are the group differences in the
left primary sensorimotor cortex—especially in the suba-
nalysis of the right limb patients—because they coincide
with the hand representation area (SQUEEZE – STATIC
contrast). During action observation, the activity of the
primary somatosensory cortex is modulated somatotopi-
cally in relation to the observed body part,1,48,58 and
likely accounts for simulation of the somatosensory
content of the observed action (for a review, see
Keysers et al33). The somatosensory cortex is known to
display abnormal representations of the painful hand
in CRPS patients,17,32 associated with disinhibition in
the
adjacent
motor
cortex.21,32,34,56
Our
finding
indicates that the dysfunction in the sensorimotor
cortex also affects the neural processing of observed
actions.
Many of the brain areas that showed successful classi-
fications in our study are known to show abnormal acti-
vation in CRPS patients during action execution, and
they have been associated with hyperalgesia and allody-
nia in CRPS,40-42 which increases the functional reliability
of our findings.
Action execution and observation are associated with
similar changes in neuronal activity in many brain areas.
Abnormal brain activations during action observation
can thus be informative of neural processes underlying
motor dysfunction. Also, action observation has been
studied as a motor rehabilitation therapy to normalize
motor circuitry after ischemic stroke and in Parkinson dis-
ease (for a recent review, see Buccino7). In patients with
CRPS, action observation also could be used as a gentle
way to start rehabilitation, for example, before graded
motor imagery (GMI) therapy.45 In theory, action obser-
vation could complement GMI because: 1) it might be su-
perior to motor imagery in protecting normal functions
of the primary sensorimotor cortex during limb disuse,5
and 2) in contrast to motor imagery,25 there is now evi-
dence that action observation addresses the disruption
in this brain area in CRPS. In GMI, the central motor cir-
cuitry is also trained with modulated visual feedback of
the patients’ own motor actions (mirror-box therapy).
Whereas our study addressed visual processing during
motor inactivity, future studies should specify the effects
of visual feedback on neural processes during motor ac-
tions. In conclusion, our current findings of abnormal
brain activation during action observation in CRPS are
in line with the potential of action observation therapy
in CRPS patients.
Recently, classification approaches have become popu-
lar in searching for neural signatures of central nervous
system diseases,35 and, in parallel, chronic pain has
gained increasing attention.2,3,9,59,61 On this basis, our
study introduces some considerable novelties. First, we
used video stimuli in contrast to static pictures or other
conventional visual stimuli. Second, we assessed the
discriminatory power of local fMRI patterns across the
cortex in contrast to studies using the whole-brain data
or preselected brain regions. Third, we used functional

jects) and the remaining subjects (1 patient, 1 control) were considered as patients or control subjects depending on which side of the
boundary they fell; in the figure, the subjects were classified as patients if they are plotted on the right side of the boundary, and
healthy if they are on the left side. The decision boundary is marked with the dotted vertical line. Abbreviations: M1, primary motor

 data instead of structural MR imaging (eg, Bagarinao
et al,2 Baliki et al,3 and Tzourio-Mazoyer et al61) where
changes plausibly become observable long after func-
tional changes. Fourth, we stimulated the brains via vi-
sual pathways that are not, as far as we know, altered
in CRPS. The stimulation was thus more similar across
all subjects—patients and healthy controls—than what
would have been possible to obtain with for example, so-
matosensory stimuli in patients who suffer from various
types of sensorimotor deficits. Additionally, our stimuli
were known beforehand to elicit different experiences
in the studied subject groups.31
However, the purpose of our classification was not to
classify individuals in a diagnostic manner but to provide
a multivariate approach to find brain areas where the
functionality differs between 2 subject groups. Although
our results can be beneficial for the development of a
biomarker for CRPS, the requirements for clinical brain
imaging biomarkers13 were out of the scope of the study.
For biomarker development, considerably larger group
sizes would be needed, the findings should be validated
with a separate cohort with more variable patient char-
acteristics, and the specificity for CRPS should be deter-
mined with the inclusion of patients suffering from
other types of chronic pain or movement disorders. The
potential for a biomarker is, however, supported by the
findings that the data collected with 2 different MR scan-
ners showed similar discriminative response characteris-
tics between the subject groups.
We note that our sample size is relatively small, which
decreases the positive predictive value of our results (see,
for example, Button et al8) and increases the likelihood
for perfect classification accuracies (up to 100%).11
Thus, our results should be considered tentative until
confirmed with an independent and larger sample.
Moreover, although data confounds (head or hand
movements, or variation of alertness) did not differ be-
tween groups in factorwise univariate analyses, they
discriminated the subject groups in multivariate analysis
with an accuracy of 70%, suggesting that our data might
incorporate some confounding effects.
We also note that the patients were receiving medi-
cation, which is a common confound in any study of
chronic diseases; for example, 69% of our patients
used weak opioids or buprenorphine (one patient).
Opioids are known to suppress pain responses in pri-
mary and secondary somatosensory cortex and insula51
and decrease the classification accuracies between
painful and nonpainful stimuli in the primary somato-
sensory cortex.65 Thus, in contrast to increasing group
differences, the medication might hamper them and
affect the classification accuracies negatively.
Conclusions
Our approach to use video stimuli, unpleasant for pa-
tients and neutral for healthy subjects, proved success-
ful in producing discriminative fMRI signatures for
CRPS.
These
signatures
appeared
in
functionally
feasible brain areas, which increases the reliability of
our results and confirms that, in CRPS, the central mo-
tor and sensory circuitries are compromised to a level
that also affects processing of action observation.
