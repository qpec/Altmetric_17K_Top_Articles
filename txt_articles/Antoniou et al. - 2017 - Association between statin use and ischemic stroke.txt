abigatran etexilate is a direct-acting anticoagulant used 
for the prevention of stroke in patients with nonvalvular 
atrial fibrillation.1 Once absorbed, dabigatran etexilate is 
metabolized to the pharmacologically active direct thrombin 
inhibitor dabigatran by carboxylesterase enzymes.2,3 The bio-
availability of dabigatran is low (6.5%), in part because intestinal 
absorption of the prodrug is opposed by P-glycoprotein, a multi-
drug efflux transporter.4 Importantly, P-glycoprotein and carbo-
xylesterase are subject to inhibition by other drugs in the same 
manner as hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes.5,6 It is therefore 
conceivable that coadministration of drugs that inhibit either 
P-glycoprotein or carboxylesterase could increase the absorp-
tion of dabigatran etexilate and/or prevent its bioactivation to 
 
dabigatran, thereby increasing the risk of hemorrhage or 
decreasing the drug’s effectiveness.
3′-Hydroxymethylglutaryl–coenzyme A reductase inhibitors, 
generically referred to as statins, are among the most widely pre-
scribed drugs worldwide. Unlike other statins, simvastatin and 
lova 
statin are administered as lactone prodrugs that are subse-
quently metabolized to their pharmacologically active hydroxy 
forms. In contrast, the remaining marketed statins are adminis-
tered as the active hydroxy acid. Emerging evidence from in vitro 
studies suggests that statins administered in their lactone forms 
(i.e., simvastatin and lovastatin) are potent inhibitors of P-
glycoprotein and carboxylesterase enzyme activity, whereas other 
statins are not.7–10 Because hypothetical intestinal concentrations 
of simvastatin and lovastatin likely exceed those required to in-
hibit intestinal P-glycoprotein,11 coadministration with dabigatran 
etexilate could increase the absorption of dabigatran and the re-
sultant risk of hemorrhage. Conversely, inhibition of the carboxy-

ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND: Dabigatran etexilate is a 
prodrug whose absorption is opposed 
by intestinal P-glycoprotein and which is 
converted by carboxylesterase to its 
active form, dabigatran. Unlike other 
statins, simvastatin and lovastatin are 
potent inhibitors of P-glycoprotein and 
carboxylesterase, and might either 
increase the risk of hemorrhage with 
dabigatran etexilate or decrease its 
effectiveness.
METHODS: We conducted 2 population-
based, nested case–control studies involv-
ing Ontario residents 66 years of age and 
older who started dabigatran etexilate be-
tween May 1, 2012, and Mar. 31, 2014. In 
the first study, cases were patients with 
ischemic stroke; in the second, cases were 
patients with major hemorrhage. Each 
case was matched with up to 4 controls by 
age and sex. All cases and controls re-
ceived a single statin in the 60 days pre-
ceding the index date. We determined the 
association between each outcome and 
the use of simvastatin or lova 
statin, rela-
tive to other statins.
RESULTS: Among 45 991 patients taking 
dabigatran etexilate, we identified 397 
cases with ischemic stroke and 1117 cases 
with major hemorrhage. After multivari-
able adjustment, use of simvastatin or 
lova 
statin was not associated with an in-
creased risk of stroke (adjusted odds ratio 
[OR] 1.33, 95% confidence interval [CI] 
0.88 to 2.01). In contrast, use of simva-
statin and lovastatin were associated with 
a higher risk of major hemorrhage (ad-
justed OR 1.46, 95% CI 1.17 to 1.82).
INTERPRETATION: In patients receiving 
dabigatran etexilate, simvastatin and 
lovastatin were associated with a higher 
risk of major hemorrhage relative to 
other statins. Preferential use of the 
other statins should be considered in 
these patients.

lesterase enzyme could decrease the effectiveness of dabigatran 
etexilate in clinical practice. 
However, apart from a small pharmacokinetic study involving 
healthy volunteers that found that use of atorvastatin reduced 
systemic dabigatran exposure by 18% without affecting the phar-
macodynamic properties of the drug,12 data are lacking on the 
potential interaction between statins and dabigatran etexilate in 
patients with atrial fibrillation. This is important because the 
safety and efficacy of dabigatran etexilate are  
related to its 
plasma concentrations, single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the 
gene encoding P-glycoprotein are associated with a 12% in-
crease in peak dabigatran concentration per minor allele carried, 
studies with other P-glycoprotein inhibitors have found increases 
in dabigatran exposure ranging from 30% to 171%, and the likeli-
hood of concomitant statin use among these patients is high.13–16
We examined the association between statin use and subse-
quent hospital admissions or emergency department visits for isch-
emic stroke or major hemorrhage in patients with atrial fibrillation 
treated with dabigatran etexilate. Owing to their inhibitory effects 
on P-glycoprotein, we hypothesized that simvastatin and lovastatin 
would increase the risk of major hemorrhage in patients taking 
dabigatran. We also reasoned that inhibition of carboxylesterase 
enzymes by sim 
vastatin or lovastatin would prevent bioactivation 
of dabigatran etexilate, thereby increasing the risk of stroke relative 
to other statins. Because intestinal concentrations of the lactone 
forms of simva 
statin and lovastatin would be expected to exceed 
hepatic concentrations of these drugs, we anticipated that inhibi-
tion of P-glycoprotein and the resultant elevated risk of major hem-
orrhage would be the more important interaction.
Methods
Setting
We conducted 2 population-based, nested case–control studies 
involving Ontario residents 66 years of age and older who started 
dabigatran etexilate between May 1, 2012, and Mar. 31, 2014. 
These individuals had universal access to physician services, hos-
pital care and prescription drug coverage. 
Data sources
We used Ontario’s administrative health databases, which are held 
securely in linkable files without direct personal identifiers. We iden-
tified prescription drug records using the Ontario Drug Benefit data-
base, which contains comprehensive records of prescription drugs 
dispensed to Ontario residents aged 65 years and older. Patients re-
ceiving medications under the Ontario Drug Benefit program may 
obtain a maximum of 100 days of treatment for each prescription. 
We obtained hospital admission and emergency department data 
from the Can 
adian Institute for Health Information’s Discharge Ab-
stract Database and National Ambulatory Care Reporting System, 
respectively. We used the Ontario Health Insurance Plan database to 
identify claims for physician services, and we used validated disease 
registries to ascertain the presence of comorbid diabetes, hyperten-
sion, myocardial infarction and congestive heart failure.17–20 We ob-
tained basic demographic data from the Registered Persons Data-
base, a registry of all Ontario residents eligible for health in 
surance. 
These databases were linked in an anonymous fashion using en-
crypted health card  
numbers, and are routinely used to study the 
consequences of drug interactions.21–23

Study design and participants
We identified a cohort of patients treated with dabigatran etexilate 
between May 1, 2012, and Mar. 31, 2014. Use of this drug is re-
stricted by the Ontario Drug Benefit formulary for the prevention 
of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with nonvalvular 
atrial fibrillation. For each patient, we defined a period of continu-
ous use of dabigatran etexilate beginning with the first prescrip-
tion after the patient’s 66th birthday. We defined ongoing use as 
receipt of a prescription refill within 1.5 times the days covered by 
the previous prescription. We excluded the first year of eligibility 
for prescription drug coverage (age 65) to avoid incomplete medi-
cation records. Observation ended with the first occurrence of a 
study outcome, death, the end of the study period, or cessation of 
dabigatran etexilate treatment, defined by the date of the final 
prescription plus 1.5 times the prescription days’ supply.
In the first study, we defined cases as patients with a hospital 
admission or emergency department visit for ischemic stroke 
(see Appendix 1, available at www.cmaj.ca/lookup/suppl/doi 
:10.1503/cmaj.160303/-/DC1, for International Statistical Classifi-
cation of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th revision 
[ICD-10] codes) during a period of continuous dabigatran therapy 
within 60 days of receiving a prescription for 1 of the following: 
lovastatin, simvastatin, atorva 
statin, pravastatin, fluvastatin or 
rosuvastatin. The codes used to identify stroke were previously 
validated against patient records from 18 hospitals across On-
tario.24 The date of hospital admission or emergency department 
visit for stroke served as the index date for all analyses. For pa-
tients with recurrent ischemic strokes, we considered only the 
first occurrence. We excluded from the analysis patients who re-
ceived prescriptions for multiple statins in the 60 days preceding 
the index date.
For each case, we selected up to 4 controls from the same cohort 
of patients receiving dabigatran etexilate. Controls were randomly 
assigned index dates to match the distribution of index dates 
among cases, and were then matched to cases by age at the index 
date (within 3 yr) and sex. Controls were required to be event-free at 
the index date and like cases were required to have received a single 
statin within 60 days preceding the index date. We excluded con-
trols who received prescriptions for multiple statins in the 60 days 
preceding the index date. Consequently, all cases and controls were 
older patients receiving dabigatran etexilate who had also received 
treatment with only 1 of the study statins in the past 60 days. When 
fewer than 4 controls were available for each case, we analyzed only 
those controls and maintained the matching process. We excluded 
cases that could not be matched to at least 1 control, and controls 
were permitted to become cases at a later date. In summary, cases 
were patients taking dabigatran etexilate who had a hospital admis-
sion or emergency department visit for ischemic stroke within 
60 days of receiving a statin. Controls were patients taking dabiga-
tran etexilate who had not experienced a stroke as of the index date 
and, like the cases, had been prescribed a study statin in the 60 days 
preceding the index date (Figure 1).
In the second study, we defined cases as patients with major 
hemorrhage (i.e., any hemorrhagic event resulting in hospital ad-
mission or visit to an emergency department; see Appendix 1 for 
ICD-10 codes). The codes used to identify hemorrhage have been 
previously validated using patient charts from a tertiary care hospi-
tal in Ontario, with specificity, sensitivity and positive predictive 
values exceeding 80%, and have been used in earlier studies.25–27 
The design and analysis were otherwise identical to those de-
scribed above (Figure 1). Specifically, cases were patients taking 
dabigatran etexilate who had a hospital admission or emergency 
department visit for major hemorrhage within 60 days of receiving 
a statin. Controls were patients taking dabigatran etexilate who 
had not experienced a hemorrhagic event as of the index date and, 
like the cases, had been prescribed a study statin in the 60 days 
preceding the index date.
Statistical analysis
We used standardized differences to compare baseline demo-
graphic and clinical characteristics of cases and controls. Stan-
dardized differences less than 0.1 indicate good balance between 
the cases and controls for a given covariate.28
We used multivariable conditional logistic regression to esti-
mate the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the 
association between stroke or transient ischemic attack and ex-
posure to lovastatin or simvastatin relative to other statins. Be-
cause transient ischemic attack is coded less accurately than 
stroke in administrative data sets, we replicated our analysis by 
considering only cases with ischemic stroke.29 We adjusted our 
models for all baseline variables with a standardized difference 
exceeding 0.1 between cases and controls. We conducted a simi-
lar analysis for the association between statins and major hemor-
rhage. We replicated our analyses by considering the effects of 
simvastatin and lovastatin separately. Because chronic kidney 
disease and recent use of warfarin could act as effect modifiers in 
the association between simvastatin or lovastatin and our study 
outcomes, we tested for interactions between these variables and 
study group in separate models. All analyses were performed us-
ing SAS version 9.3 (SAS Institute).

Results
During the study period, we identified 45 991 patients treated with 
dabigatran etexilate. Within this cohort, 836 patients were diag-
nosed with an ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack. Of 
these, 397 (47.5%) cases received a statin in the 60 days preceding 
their index date. All cases were matched to 4 controls (n = 1588). For 
the second study, we identified 2406 patients taking dabigatran who 
were diagnosed with major hemorrhage. Of these, 1117 (46.4%) 
received a statin in the 60 days preceding their index date. The over-
whelming majority (n = 1114 [99.7%]) were matched to 4 controls 
(total no. of controls 4465). The numbers of patients receiving each 
statin are summarized in Table 1. As expected, comorbidities 
were more prevalent among cases than among controls (Table 2).
After multivariable adjustment, use of simva 
statin or lovastatin 
was not associated with an increased risk of stroke or transient is-
chemic attack relative to other statins in patients receiving dabiga-
tran etexilate (adjusted OR 1.33, 95% CI 0.88–2.01) (Table 3). The re-
sults did not change appreciably when considering cases with stroke 
only (adjusted OR 1.44, 95% CI 0.87–2.39). In contrast, use of simva-
statin or lova 
statin was associated with a higher risk of major hemor-
rhage than comparator statins in these same patients (adjusted OR 
1.46, 95% CI 1.17–1.82) (Table 4). We found similar results for individ-
ual comparisons of simvastatin (adjusted OR 1.44, 95% CI 1.14–1.81) 
and lovastatin (adjusted OR 1.90, 95% CI 0.78–4.61) with comparator 
statins, although a lack of statistical power resulted in a less precise

estimate of risk for lovastatin. In sensitivity analyses, the presence of 
chronic kidney disease (p for interaction = 0.09) or prior warfarin use 
(p for interaction = 0.83) did not influence the association between 
statin group and major hemorrhage.
Interpretation
We found that simvastatin and lovastatin were associated with an 
increased risk of major hemorrhage among older patients taking 
dabigatran etexilate. We did not, however, observe a heightened 
risk of stroke relative to statins that do not inhibit carboxylesterase. 
This may in part reflect the smaller number of stroke cases and in-
sufficient power to detect a significant association. In light of the 
expected association with major hemorrhage, our findings suggest 
that simvastatin and lovastatin should be avoided in patients tak-
ing dabigatran etexilate who require statin therapy.
Our finding that patients taking simvastatin or lovastatin with 
da 
bigatran etexilate face a higher risk of major hemorrhage is consis-

tent with the observation that these drugs inhibit intestinal 
P-glycoprotein, thereby increasing systemic dabigatran exposure.9 
Unlike other statins, simva 
statin and lovastatin are administered in 
their lactone forms, which are nearly 10-fold more potent as inhibitors 
of P-glycoprotein than the hydroxy acid metabolites of these drugs.9 
In contrast, the remaining statins are administered as hydroxy acids, 
which are relatively weak P-glycoprotein inhibitors. Consequently, a 
clinically important interaction between dabigatran etexilate and 
these statins would not be expected; this assertion is supported by 
findings of a small decrease in dabigatran concentrations with the 
concomitant use of atorvastatin.12 Although increased dabigatran 
absorption might also be expected to improve drug efficacy, previous 
studies have found a stronger relation between dabigatran concen-
trations and major hemorrhage than for ischemic events.13
Another possible explanation for the lack of association between 
simvastatin or lovastatin and the risk of stroke relates to postabsorp-
tion hydrolysis of the lactone form of these drugs to their pharmaco-
logically active hydroxy acid forms, which do not inhibit carboxyles-
terase.7,8 Consequently, the bioactivation of dabigatran would not be 
inhibited, and no influence on dabigatran efficacy would be observed. 
This reasoning may also explain the lack of a clinically relevant drug 
interaction between simva 
statin and angiotensin-converting-enzyme 
inhibitors that require carboxylesterase enzymes for bioactivation.30
Limitations
Some limitations of our work merit emphasis. We used adminis-
trative data and had no access to laboratory data or information 
about indices of renal function, smoking, nonprescription use of 
acetylsalicylic acid and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, 
and adequacy of blood pressure and diabetes control. We could 
not ascertain the extent of medication adherence to dabigatran 
etexilate or statins. Although we used previously validated codes 
for outcome ascertainment, outcome misclassification is possi-
ble. However, these limitations apply equally to all statins stud-
ied. In addition, some imbalance in baseline characteristics was 
apparent between cases and controls. However, this is expected 
in a case–control study when cases are defined by an adverse out-
come. Importantly, the key comparison in our analysis is not be-
tween cases and controls, but between statin types. We could not 
ascertain whether doses of dabigatran were adjusted in patients 
with chronic kidney disease. However, chronic kidney disease was 
not an effect modifier in the association between statin type and 
major hemorrhage. We had no data on when dabigatran etexilate 
was taken in relation to lova 
statin or simvastatin, because it is 
possible that separation of these drugs may mitigate the effect of 
this interaction. However, the phenomenon of competitive P-
glycoprotein inhibition and spacing of medication should attenu-
ate any observed effect in our analysis. The 
number of cases receiving lovastatin and 
simvastatin in each study was small; this may 
have influenced our power to detect an asso-
ciation between these drugs and stroke, and 
may have limited our ability to establish 
whether event risk varies according to statin 
dose. Although we defined major hemor-
rhage using hospital admission and emer-
gency department data, not all anticoagula-
tion patients presenting to the emergency 
department have major bleeding. Finally, our 
findings may not apply to younger patients, 
who may have fewer risk factors for stroke or 
major hemorrhage.
Conclusion
We found that among older patients taking 
dabigatran etexilate, simvastatin and lova-
statin were not associated with an increased 
risk of stroke relative to other statins, suggest-
ing that carboxylesterase inhibition is of little 
clinical relevance in this setting. However, this 
finding may reflect a lack of power for detect-
ing an association. In contrast, simvastatin 
and lovastatin were associated with an in-
creased risk of major hemorrhage in these pa-
tients, which may reflect increased dabigatran 
absorption as a result of P-glycoprotein inhibi-
tion. Clinicians should consider avoiding sim-
vastatin and lova 
statin in older patients re-
ceiving dabigatran etexilate who require statin 
therapy.
