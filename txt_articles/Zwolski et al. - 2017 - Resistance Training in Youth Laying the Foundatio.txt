hildhood and early adolescence have been hailed as 
critical windows for the development of optimal 
physical literacy.9,73 Defined as the “ability, confidence, 
and desire to be physically active for life,”4,5 physical literacy is 
thought to be a cornerstone to lifelong health and fitness.131,132 
There is growing recognition that a foundational set of 
movement skills should be mastered during childhood to 
facilitate the potential for long-term engagement and confidence 
in physical activity.14,99 Insufficient mastery of these skills can 
lead to an inability to physically and socially keep up with 
active peers, which in turn can lead to cascading effects for 
motivation, desire, and ability to be physically active and avoiding 
injury in later adolescence and adulthood.14,31,32,52,128 Of 
particular concern is insufficient muscular fitness among 
children,19,114,119 which is marked as a vital component to the 
health, wellness, and success of any youth looking to participate 
in sports and recreational activity. A compelling body of

Context: The rising incidence of physical activity– and sports-related injuries has prompted the present-day investigation of 
resistance training as a potential means of injury prevention and physical literacy development among youth.
Evidence Acquisition: Relevant studies on the topics of athlete development, physical literacy, resistance training, and 
injury prevention in children and adolescents were reviewed (PubMed and Sports Discus, 1982-2016). Recommendations 
from consensus guidelines and position statements applicable to resistance training and injury prevention in youth, in 
addition to young athlete development, were reviewed. Additionally, hand searches, expert requests, article reference lists, 
and gray literature were utilized and reviewed for pertinent content.
Study Design: Clinical review.
Level of Evidence: Level 4.
Results: Youth throughout the physical activity spectrum are at risk for physical activity– and sports-related injury. 
Of highest priority are early specializers, physically inactive youth, and young girls, owing to increased injury rates. 
Resistance training among these at-risk populations has been shown to reduce injury risk by up to 68% and improve 
sports performance and health measures, in addition to accelerating the development of physical literacy. Recent 
recommendations, position statements, and national initiatives advocate for the incorporation of resistance training with 
qualified instruction among these groups.
Conclusion: Resistance training in addition to free play and other structured physical activity training can serve as a 
protective means against injury and a positive catalyst for the development of physical literacy to offset the impact of 
diminishing physical activity and early sport specialization in today’s youth.

Olympic Committee (IOC)14 and the National Strength and 
Conditioning Association (NSCA),73 strongly support regular 
participation in resistance training as a means of reducing 
sports-related injury risk and improving physical literacy among 
youth.14,73,75,127 The evidence has dispelled myths and addressed 
previous concerns regarding prepubescent resistance training, 
calling to action the qualified professionals who are well-suited 
to facilitate the improved health, performance, and well-being 
of children through resistance training.75
Over the past several years, there has been considerable 
world-wide interest in the emerging concept and field of study 
of physical literacy. However, recent recommendations and 
position statements promoting physical activity in youth from 
the World Health Organization (WHO),134 the NSCA,73 and the 
IOC14 have all highlighted that the population of youth today is 
alarmingly less physically active compared with the generations 
that have preceded them. From a different perspective, there 
are rising concerns about emerging trends of pushing our 
youth to higher intensities and more frequent training 
schedules at younger and younger levels in youth sport 
programs.63,68,86 Thus, we see a dichotomy of physical activity 
in our youth. On one end of the physical activity spectrum sit 
the kids who lead increasingly sedentary lifestyles, with little to 
no access to recess or physical education and increasing rates 
of disease, such as diabetes and obesity.48,78 At the other end of 
the physical activity spectrum live the kids who participate in 
intense amounts of physical activity, specializing early in their 
respective sports and at high risk for overuse injuries and 
burnout.48,65 Both of these extremes paint a bleak picture for 
the physical literacy and overall health and well-being of the 
next generations.
The purpose of this article was to synthesize and review the 
most recent literature related to young athlete development as it 
pertains to resistance training and physical literacy. The role of 
resistance training as a means of injury prevention for children 
and adolescents will be considered. Subsequently, resistance 
training during childhood and adolescence as a facilitator for 
the development of physical literacy will be discussed.
For the purposes of this article, and in accordance with 
existing literature, childhood refers to the developmental period 
of life from the end of infancy to the beginning of adolescence, 
and the term children represents girls and boys (generally up to 
the age of 11 and 13 years, respectively) who have not 
developed secondary sex characteristics.74,75 Because of 
maturational differences, girls 12 to 18 years and boys 14 to 18 
years are generally considered adolescents.75 The terms youth 
and young athletes are broadly defined to include both children 
and adolescents.74 As such, articles that studied individuals older 
than 18 years were not included. In accordance with previous 
definitions,10,41,75 this article will define resistance training as a 
specialized method of conditioning that involves the progressive 
use of a wide range of resistive loads, including body mass, and 
a variety of training modalities (eg, machine-based training, free 
weight training, plyometric training, complex training, functional 
training) designed to enhance muscular fitness and athletic 
performance (Figures 1 and 2).

Methods
Studies from 1982 through 2016 indexed in PubMed and Sports 
Discus on the topics of young athlete development, physical 
literacy, resistance training, and injury prevention in children 
and adolescents were reviewed. Search terms included the 
following: strength training OR resistance training AND 
children, strength training OR resistance training AND 
adolescents, strength training OR resistance training AND 
injury prevention, physical literacy, and young athlete 
development. Also reviewed were recommendations from 
consensus guidelines and position statements applicable to 
resistance training and injury prevention in youth, in addition to 
young athlete development. Furthermore, information through 
hand searching, expert requests, article reference lists, and gray 
literature, such as noncommercially published reports, was 
reviewed for pertinent content.
Physical activity injury risk
Young athletes and nonathletes alike require a basal level of 
strength and power to build a strong foundation for a 
sustainable active lifestyle.42 As a result of declining physical 
literacy levels, youth across the activity level spectrum are at an 
increased risk for what are considered to be preventable 
injuries.16,18,58,99
The number of youth reporting overuse-type injuries has 
become a growing concern for sports health professionals, a 
consequence of overexposure to high volume and intensity of 
sport-specific training without adequate rest.65 The overall 
estimate of the proportion of injuries that are overuse in nature 
among children and adolescents ranges from 45.9% to 54.0%.26 
Youth aged 7 to 18 years participating in more hours of sports 
per week than his or her number of age in years and/or whose 
ratio of organized sports to free play time is more than 2:1 
hours per week have increased odds of having a serious 
overuse injury.65 The detrimental impact of overuse injuries 
among this population involves the potential for nonfunctional 
overreaching, burnout, and eventual dropout from sport.26,91
While intense participation in a single sport has been linked 
to an increase in overuse injuries,65 an insufficient amount of 
physical activity, or exercise deficit disorder (EDD),47 and 
inadequate preparation for sports participation results in 
“underuse” sports-related injuries in children and 
adolescents.16,78 Many youth with EDD lack the foundational 
muscular strength and endurance to safely execute motor skills 
within the demands of sport or recreational activity, a potential 
underlying cause of musculoskeletal injury, described as 
“underuse” in nature.73,120 Young people lacking adequate 
physical activity levels also tend to have lower fitness levels,99 
which is linked to an increased risk of sports-related injury.22,118 
Data regarding the incidence of underuse injuries are severely 
lacking, as most estimates of sports-related injury rates among 
youth do not account for what may be an increasing number of 
unreported sports-related injuries suffered by children and 
adolescents with EDD.26
Irrespective of activity level, young girls are especially prone 
to unique injury patterns and medical conditions that differ from 
their male counterparts due to biomechanical, anatomic, and 
hormonal factors.59 Numerous reports have shown that puberty 
has a more significant impact on the neuromuscular 
development of girls, resulting in the development of risky joint 
mechanics and other injury risk factors.49,57 Girls presenting to a 
pediatric medical center suffered overuse injuries at a greater 
rate than boys (63% vs 40%, respectively).121 In addition to 
patellofemoral disorders28,62 and lower extremity stress 
fractures,59 which are both overuse in nature, greater rates of 
traumatic injuries such as anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears 
occur among adolescent girls.112,123,129 Increases in body mass 
and the height of center of mass in pubertal girls are not 
accompanied by the same adaptations in strength and power 
seen in boys, placing young girls at increased risk of lower 
extremity injury.103 Similarly, deficits in lower extremity strength 
increase from prepubertal to pubertal stages in young girls,113 
which may predispose them to develop poor neuromuscular 
control strategies during sports-related movements.24,66,75,93,111 
Specific sex differences in strength are both muscle-group and 
muscle-action specific; however, by late puberty, a sex 
difference in the expression of strength of approximately 50% 
occurs in girls.14,75,113 Coupled with a physical activity sex gap 
that arises by age 9 among girls of all ethnicities and races,107 
training programs designed to facilitate improved strength and 
safer movement mechanics specifically geared toward young 
girls of racial and ethnic minority statuses could be particularly 
impactful.75
Protective effects of resistance 
training for youth
Successful performance of fundamental movement skills is 
associated with positive, long-term engagement in movement-
related activities,82 and consequently, greater activity levels 
moving into adulthood.124 Stronger youth become more efficient 
“movers” and will likely move with more confidence and 
competence in their physical abilities, resulting in enhanced 
physical literacy.37,53,54 Stronger children and adolescents are also 
likely to be better prepared for the rigors of sport and moderate 
to vigorous physical activity participation and less likely to suffer 
a preventable physical activity–related injury.76,100 Collectively, 
these factors suggest that youth across the activity spectrum could 
potentially benefit immensely from resistance training.44,100,102
Over the past decade or so, there has been a shift in attitudes 
and level of support for resistance training among children and 
adolescents. A compelling body of evidence has emerged in recent 
years that has resulted in a progression beyond the argument for or 
against resistance training among youth to improve 
performance42,73 and instead led to an emergence of numerous 
international position statements supporting youth resistance 
training as a vital piece of physical development.14,75,94,127

speed,96 kicking velocity,133 endurance,51,130 dynamic balance,27 
flexibility,97 and general motor performance.12 These gains make 
young athletes more resistant to sports-related injuries.42,44,106,119 A 
recent meta-analysis of children and adolescent athletes indicates 
that resistance training reduces sports-related injuries, both 
overuse and acute, by up to 66%.69 In addition to strength, power, 
and endurance gains, youth who engage in resistance training 
programs can also improve their general fitness levels,75 increase 
confidence in their physical abilities,14 and experience enhanced 
mental health and well-being.33 These findings emphasize that 
resistance training is also a beneficial activity for nonathletes.
For those who limit participation to intense training in a single 
sport during childhood, a multifaceted resistance training 
program with qualified instruction can ensure that the 
diversification of motor skill development occurs prior to the 
onset of puberty.78 Additionally, the enhancement of strength can 
address ensuing muscular imbalances that may heighten risk of 
overuse or overexposure injury in the future.78 A consensus 
statement on youth athlete development issued by the IOC 
suggested there is a critical need for preparatory muscular fitness 
training to achieve optimal young athlete wellness and maintain 
long-term performance into adolescence and adulthood.14 
Participation in a multifaceted resistance training program by 
athletes who specialize in a sport at a young age may assist the 
development of physical literacy skills typically acquired through 
free play and involvement in other sports.79
On the opposite end of the physical activity spectrum, young 
children with insufficient exposure to sports and physical 
activity can benefit from early onset of structured resistance 
training as an intervention for muscular strength deficiencies 
and overall lack of physical activity. With similar or even less 
amounts of free play than early sport specializers, children in 
this segment of the population may be ill-prepared to tolerate 
recommended levels of moderate to vigorous physical 
activity.40,47 Interestingly, less active youth may actually find 
themselves at an advantage with regard to trainability compared 
with their athletic peers because great initial enhancements of 
motor performance skills are found in young, untrained subjects 
after a resistance training intervention.12,71,116
By the same token, a recent meta-analysis reported that 
female athletes have significantly larger training-induced 
improvements in sport-specific performance than male athletes, 
suggesting the trainability of girls may be higher compared with 
boys.71 With baseline neuromuscular performance levels lower 
on average for female athletes,50,56,104 observed gains secondary 
to resistance training, such as improved vertical jump height and 
lower extremity biomechanics,104 have also been found to be 
higher among female athletes compared with males.75 
Furthermore, another meta-analysis on the effects of 
preventative neuromuscular training intervention on ACL injury 
risk in young female athletes named “strengthening,” in addition 
to proximal control exercises and multiexercise genres, as one 
of the most efficacious injury prevention interventions for this 
at-risk population.122 In addition to reducing injury risk among 
young girls by up to 68%,122 resistance training programs 
improve skeletal growth,11,15 induce a protective “neuromuscular 
spurt,”38,104 and improve physical self-perception,83 all of which 
may increase the likelihood of trained girls remaining physically 
active in the long term.
Physical activity rates  
and Physical literacy
More than 60 million US youth participate in organized sport 
activities,109 with 27 million kids between the ages of 6 and 18 
years active in team sports.6 However, there is growing 
recognition that the number of children and adolescents 
classified as having EDD by not engaging in the minimum 
recommended amount of physical activity is increasing, 
beginning as early as age 6 years.37,60,126 A recent survey of sport 
participation rates by age, sex, and income level revealed the 
percentage of youth participating in “high-calorie burning 
activities” a minimum of 151 times per year has fallen since 2008 
from 30.2% to 26.6% for children aged 6 to 12 years and from 
42.7% to 39.3% among adolescents.6 Thirty percent of youth 
discontinue participation in at least 1 sport club annually,25 and 
up to 70% will quit sports all together by age 14 years.30
Participation in organized sports alone does not guarantee the 
recommended amount of moderate-to-vigorous physical 
activity.42,70,125 Only 24% of youth sports participants were able to 
meet the moderate-to-vigorous recommendation during team 
practice, as more than 55% of time can be spent standing in line 
and receiving verbal instruction.70 Comparable to the “active couch 
potato” classification in adults, which identifies an individual who 
sits long hours despite meeting physical activity recommendations, 
a rising number of young athletes who remain sedentary outside of 
all sports practices can also be diagnosed with EDD.110 
Interestingly, a large percentage of children and adolescents with 
EDD actually are participants in registered youth sports.45
At the other end of the activity spectrum, young, elite-level 
athletes often train year-round, intensely, in 1 sport at the 
exclusion of all other sports. These athletes are 
specializers.63,64,86 They are early specializers if they meet these 
conditions prior to 13 years of age.48 Clear data regarding the 
number of children specializing early in 1 sport are not 
available at this time,48 though there is evidence of increased 
early sport specialization in the rising number of year-round 
select leagues for preadolescents.63,95
This dichotomy of physical activity among youth has resulted in 
declining free play physical activity.8,43 Children and adolescents 
benefit immensely from unstructured physical experiences, such as 
child-driven deliberate play, which is any intrinsically motivating 
sporting activity,23 and free play.5 Deliberate play and free play 
allow early sport specializers to perform movements different than 
their sport-specific skill set and also foster creative thinking.42 For 
those who are not early specializers, physically oriented free play 
provides an opportunity for motor skill acquisition during the stage 
of development that is crucial for children to “invest” in the 
exploration and learning of a broad range of fundamental 
movement skills. These skills will serve as strong foundations for

more advanced movement skills later in life and protect them from 
physical activity–associated injuries throughout development.65,77,101 
Free play can also increase levels of autonomy, motivation, and 
enjoyment of physical activities by allowing children to explore 
movement patterns and receive immediate gratification not 
associated with winning or losing.23
A particularly susceptible population that is of special interest 
to sports health professionals is female adolescents. Despite an 
explosion of sports participation rates after the passage of Title 
IX,108 girls are less active than boys, regardless of race and 
ethnicity.29 Girls tend to enter sports at a later age than boys, 
and by 14 years of age, girls are dropping out of sports at 2 
times the rate of boys, demonstrating a narrower window of 
opportunity for girls in organized sports.115 Within a culture of 
diminishing free and deliberate play, young girls are particularly 
at risk for poor physical literacy.
current resistance training 
recoMMendations for youth
For sports health professionals, injury prevention remains an 
evolving science. Yet, an ample amount of research exists 
supporting resistance training as a beneficial activity to optimize 
long-term health and wellness of youth. Therefore, resistance 
training has been classified as an essential component to youth 
physical development and a fundamental element of sports 
medicine.42 Accordingly, the development of guidelines for 
resistance training for children and adolescents is a recent 
priority.17,35,42,72 The initiation of resistance training serves as a 
valuable supplement to the recommended exploratory free play 
and deliberate play during early childhood73 and accelerates the 
development of a functional foundation of strength,42 optimizing 
performance14 and reducing injury risk during sport sampling in 
childhood118 and possible specialization after adolescence.1,41
Timing of Strength and Resistance 
Training Initiation
Youth not exposed to resistance training at a young age will 
inevitably need to address neuromuscular deficiencies to enhance 
athletic development or potentially in rehabilitation after an  
injury.14,31,32,51,128 With concerns regarding the safety of resistance 
training in children as young as age 6 dispelled,73,87,90 attention 
has turned to the age or maturation stage at which it becomes 
necessary and/or advantageous to intervene with resistance 
training programs. In concurrence with the IOC14 and other 
advocates of long-term athlete and youth development 
models,73,75 many experts agree that earlier participation is 
better.42,43,45,105 A child may begin participating in a structured 
resistance training program when he or she is emotionally mature 
enough to receive and follow directions and demonstrates 
proficient levels of balance and postural control, which typically 
occurs around ages 6 to 7 years.67,75,105 Children demonstrate 
greater training-induced gains in strength51,71,116 and motor skill 
performance12 than adolescents. Prior to puberty, children 
demonstrate higher levels of neural plasticity73,76 that render them 
more “pliable” to the acquisition of protective fundamental motor 
skills,76 foundational strength,14 and the desire to be physically 
active.73 Children as young as 5 years have benefited from school-
based resistance training programs.3,15,80,81,84,85,88
Training Prescription for Youth
Meta-analytical studies examining the effects of resistance 
training on performance in children and adolescents have 
addressed inquiries on dose-response relationships of training, 
including frequency, intensity, volume, and rest.13,71 Significant 
positive correlation has been found between gains in motor 
performance skills and the mean intensity (%1 RM [repetition 
maximum]) of the training program,12 suggesting that children 
and adolescents demonstrate greater improvements in running, 
jumping, and throwing performance secondary to greater 
exercise intensity (ie, 60%-80% of 1 RM). As such, the average 
resistance training program most effective in eliciting gains 
among youth consisted of 2 to 3 sets of 8 to 15 repetitions, with 
loads between 60% and 80% of 1 RM on 6 to 8 exercises.13
Of equal importance in the training prescription is an emphasis 
on physical literacy instruction. Physically literate youth perform 
exercises with enhanced technical ability, competence, and 
confidence.42 Integrative neuromuscular training (INT) is a 
concept that emphasizes general and specific strength and 
conditioning activities to enhance both health- and skill-related 
components of physical fitness (Figure 3).100 A cornerstone of 
INT is age-appropriate, qualified, and enthusiastic instruction 
tailored to meet a child’s needs, goals, and abilities.75,100 This 
qualified instruction is necessary to facilitate the mastery of 
fundamental movements, and ultimately, maintain open 
pathways for all types of physical activity and promote the 
confidence and desire to stay physically active for life.42
Integration With Other Physical Activities
A combination of supervised, structured training and deliberate 
and free play can maximize a child’s ability, confidence, and 
desire to pursue athletic goals and physical activity in the long 
term.7,23 Sports health professionals should adjust to the needs 
of today’s youth by advocating for and facilitating the 
improvement of programs such as school-based physical

441
education and organized sports programs to incorporate 
resistance training, opportunities for free and deliberate physical 
play, and INT to foster the development of physical literacy.42,45
The National Athletic Trainers’ Association position statement 
on the prevention of pediatric overuse injuries includes a 
recommendation for preseason and in-season training programs 
with a focus on strengthening of the lower extremities.127 It also 
suggests that young athletes could benefit greatly from a 
general fitness program with a specific emphasis on 
strengthening 2 months prior to the onset of a sport season to 
avoid a rapid transition to higher levels of physical activity 
demands in training and competition.127 This may be 
particularly important for athletes who adopt the “active couch 
potato” lifestyle.
When wisely scheduled into preseason and in-season sports 
training of the early specializer, the incorporation of an 
appropriately-designed resistance training program has the 
potential to reduce muscle imbalances due to repetitive motor 
patterns73 and effectively keep the athlete healthy and involved 
in intense competition long term.42 Of particular concern in 
early sport specialization is the week-to-week accumulation of 
high volume and frequency of training. In addition to sport 
sampling and free play, resistance training should be viewed not 
as an additional training session but as an alternative 
commitment in place of sport-specific training or competition.75
A convincing body of evidence has found that resistance 
training programs implemented in primary schools are effective 
in improving aerobic capacity,36,89,92 strength,2,12,34,36 and the 
acquisition of fundamental movement skills.98 The continuity of 
quality school-based programs also shows potential to promote 
staying physically active for life, guarding against the potential 
regressions in training-induced strength and power gains seen 
during periods of detraining among youth.39,42,61,117 School-based 
programs in the Netherlands have reduced sports-related 
injuries among children.20,21 Primary school represents a 
potential sex-specific window for optimal implementation of 
training, as prepubertal girls are particularly sensitive to 
resistance training in standard physical education classes.46,101 
Sex aside, the advancement of resistance training activities in 
physical education, and particularly INT, within schools may be 
the best means of exposing children and adolescents to the 
protective effects of resistance training through qualified 
instructors.100
conclusion
Resistance training integrated with free play and other 
structured physical activity training can provide protective 
mechanisms against injury and positive catalysts for the 
development of physical literacy to offset the impact of 
diminishing physical activity and early sport specialization 
among today’s youth. Of highest priority are those children and 
adolescents at increased risk for insufficient physical and motor 
skill development including early sport specializers,65 the 
growing population of children and adolescents who are not 
satisfying current health-related physical activity 
recommendations,99 and young adolescent girls.59,121
