CD19-specific chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)–modified T cells have antitumor activity in B cell malignancies,
but factors that affect toxicity and efficacy have been difficult to define because of differences in lympho-
depletion and heterogeneity of CAR-T cells administered to individual patients. We conducted a clinical trial
in which CD19 CAR-T cells were manufactured from defined T cell subsets and administered in a 1:1 CD4+/CD8+
ratio of CAR-T cells to 32 adults with relapsed and/or refractory B cell non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma after cyclo-
phosphamide (Cy)–based lymphodepletion chemotherapy with or without fludarabine (Flu). Patients who received
Cy/Flu lymphodepletion had increased CAR-T cell expansion and persistence, and higher response rates [50% com-
plete remission (CR), 72% overall response rate (ORR)] than patients who received Cy-based lymphodepletion
without Flu (8% CR, 50% ORR). The CR rate in patients treated with Cy/Flu at the maximally tolerated dose was
64% (82% ORR; n = 11). Cy/Flu minimized the effects of an immune response to the murine single-chain vari-
able fragment component of the CAR, which limited CAR-T cell expansion and clinical efficacy in patients who
received Cy-based lymphodepletion without Flu. Severe cytokine release syndrome (sCRS) and grade ≥3 neuro-
toxicity were observed in 13 and 28% of all patients, respectively. Serum biomarkers, one day after CAR-T cell
infusion, correlated with subsequent sCRS and neurotoxicity. Immunotherapy with CD19 CAR-T cells in a defined
CD4+/CD8+ ratio allowed identification of correlative factors for CAR-T cell expansion, persistence, and toxicity,
and facilitated optimization of lymphodepletion that improved disease response and overall and progression-
free survival.
INTRODUCTION
Lymphodepletion chemotherapy, followed by adoptive transfer of
unselected autologous T cells that are genetically modified to express
a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) specific for CD19 (CD19 CAR-T
cells), has produced a high rate of complete responses (CRs) in refrac-
tory B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) (1–5); however,
results of therapy in refractory non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL) have
been less impressive (6–8). Human CD4+ and CD8+ T cells are com-
posed of distinct subsets that differ in their capacities to proliferate,
persist in vivo, and mediate antitumor effects after in vitro expansion
and adoptive transfer (9–13). In preclinical studies, we demonstrated
that human CD19 CAR-T cells that were manufactured from purified
CD4+ or CD8+ central memory (TCM) or naïve (TN) T cells were
more potent in the elimination of CD19+ tumors from immunodefi-
cient mice compared to CD19 CAR-T cells that were manufactured
from effector memory (TEM) cells (13). We also observed synergistic
enhancement in antitumor activity by administering a defined ratio
of CD19 CAR-T cells derived from CD8+ and CD4+ T cell subsets, as
compared to infusion of CAR-T cells derived from either the subset
alone or the unselected T cells without regard for subset composition
(13). Differences in the T cell subset composition of CAR-T cells pre-
pared from unselected T cells and administered to patients with NHL
in previous studies could, in part, have contributed to differences in
efficacy in these studies (6–8, 14). Moreover, heterogeneity in the sub-
set composition of infused CAR-T cells has made it challenging in
these earlier trials to discern factors that correlate with expansion and
persistence of CD19 CAR-T cells, quality and durability of antitumor
responses, and the toxicities of CAR-T cell therapy. We hypothesized
that selecting defined subsets of T cells for genetic modification and
their formulation in a defined CD4+/CD8+ ratio would provide a more
uniform CAR-T cell product for clinical applications, result in repro-
ducible in vivo activity, and facilitate identification of factors that cor-
relate with efficacy or toxicity.
Lymphopenia and the impaired proliferative capacity of T cells
from patients with B cell malignancies present challenges to CAR-T
cell manufacturing. In some clinical trials, the proliferation of autolo-
gous T cells in response to a test in vitro stimulation with anti-CD3/
CD28 beads has been used to predict the success of manufacturing
CD19 CAR-T cells and determine patient eligibility for enrollment
(15–17). Using this strategy, 24% of B-ALL patients were excluded from
participation in a pediatric clinical trial, and the fraction of NHL pa-
tients who would be excluded was even higher, ranging between 75
and 100%, depending on the status of the patient’s disease at the time
the T cells were collected (15). We developed a strategy in which CD4+

 and CD8+ T cell subsets are separately selected from apheresis products,
transduced with the CD19 CAR, and then stimulated in vitro with
an irradiated CD19+ Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) lymphoblastoid cell
line (LCL) to selectively expand transduced T cells capable of pro-
liferating. The CAR-T cell product was then formulated in a de-
fined CD4+/CD8+ CAR-T cell ratio and administered in a dose
escalation/de-escalation format after lymphodepletion chemotherapy.
We demonstrate that this approach for manufacturing a CAR-T cell
product of defined composition was feasible in heavily pretreated pa-
tients with relapsed and refractory NHL, without excluding any pa-
tient on the basis of lymphopenia or the results of in vitro proliferation
assays. The defined composition approach also allowed identifica-
tion of correlative factors for CAR-T cell expansion and persistence
in vivo, toxicity, and clinical response, and enabled optimization of a
lymphodepletion regimen that improved disease response and overall
and progression-free survival.
RESULTS
Patient characteristics
Thirty-seven patients with relapsed or refractory CD19+ NHL with a
median age of 57 years (range, 22 to 70 years) were enrolled in the
study and underwent leukapheresis for CD19 CAR-T cell manufactur-
ing. Three of the 37 patients were in CR at enrollment and were in-
eligible to receive lymphodepletion chemotherapy and CAR-T cells,
and 2 patients had rapidly progressive disease and chose to withdraw
from the study to receive hospice care before starting treatment. The
32 patients who proceeded to lymphodepletion chemotherapy and
CD19 CAR-T cell infusion (Table 1) had previously received a me-
dian of 5 treatment regimens (range, 2 to 11) for de novo large B
cell lymphoma (LBCL; n = 11), LBCL that had transformed from
indolent disease (TFLBCL; n = 11), mantle cell lymphoma (MCL;
n = 4), or follicular lymphoma (FL; n = 6). Sixteen patients had re-
lapsed after autologous (n = 14) or allogeneic (n = 4) hematopoietic
stem cell transplantation (HCT). Before lymphodepletion and CAR-T
cell therapy, all patients had measurable disease (≥2 cm) in lymph
nodes or other extramedullary sites. The median tumor bulk esti-
mated by the sum of the cross-sectional areas of six index lesions was
2933 mm2 (range, 124 to 17,907 mm2; n = 30; lesion size could not
be calculated for the other two patients). Nine patients had bone
marrow disease, and one patient had lymphoma detected by flow
cytometry in the cerebrospinal fluid that was refractory to intra-
thecal chemotherapy.
Heterogeneity of T cell subsets in NHL patients
An objective of our study was to determine the feasibility of manufac-
turing a consistent CD19 CAR-T cell product from NHL patients by
selecting defined CD8+ and CD4+ T cell subsets from leukapheresis
products, transducing each subset separately, and formulating a CAR-T
cell product composed of a 1:1 ratio of CD8+ and CD4+ T cells (fig. S1).
Before leukapheresis, we evaluated the proportions of CD4+ and CD8+
naïve and memory T cell subsets in the blood of each patient (Fig. 1, A
to D). NHL patients had lower absolute numbers of CD4+ and CD8+
T cells compared to a cohort of healthy individuals (Fig. 1B) and a
highly variable ratio of CD4+/CD8+ T cells (median, 1.47; range, 0.1 to
13.7) (table S1). At screening before leukapheresis, the absolute CD4+
and CD8+ T cell counts in the blood were <250/ml in 13 of 32 patients
(41%) and in 17 of 32 patients (53%), respectively. The fractions of
naïve and memory subsets in the CD4+ and CD8+ compartments dif-
fered between NHL patients and healthy donors (Fig. 1, C and D), and
there was wide variation in the percentages of each subset in individ-
ual patients. These data suggest that, particularly in NHL patients who
have higher fractions of terminally differentiated TEM/EMRA and/or a
very high or low ratio of CD4+/CD8+ T cells in the blood, the ability to
manufacture a CD19 CAR-T cell product of consistent potency may
be enhanced by selection of defined T cell subsets from the leukapheresis
product for CAR modification and formulation in a defined CD4+/CD8+
CAR-T cell ratio.
CD19 CAR-T cell manufacturing
Each patient underwent a leukapheresis procedure without any seri-
ous adverse events. CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were enriched by Clini-
MACS selection from separate aliquots of each patient’s leukapheresis
product for subsequent CAR-T cell manufacturing. Using immuno-
magnetic cell selection, highly enriched CD4+ T cells were isolated
from leukapheresis products for CAR manufacturing from all patients.
We used a two-step immunomagnetic selection procedure to enrich
CD8+ TCM cells for CAR-T cell manufacturing from patients with a
CD8+ TCM cell count of ≥20/ml in the blood on a screening assay (n =
20; CD8+ TCM cells were isolated from one additional patient with 13
CD8+ TCM cells/ml). From the remaining patients with CD8+ TCM
counts of <20/ml, severe lymphopenia or high circulating lymphoma
burden, we positively selected bulk CD8+ T cells (n = 10) or omitted
the CD62L selection after initial depletion of CD4+, CD14+, and
CD45RA+ cells (n = 1) to obtain an enriched CD8+ T cell population
for transduction with the CAR.
The selected CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were transduced with a lenti-
viral vector that encoded the CD19 CAR and a truncated cell surface
human epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFRt), which enabled
identification of transduced cells by flow cytometry using the anti-
EGFR monoclonal antibody, cetuximab. Transduced EGFRt+/CD4+
and EGFRt+/CD8+ T cells were stimulated once with an irradiated al-
logeneic CD19+ LCL line during culture (n = 31), resulting in enrich-
ment of the percentage of EGFRt+ cells within CD3+/CD4+ T cells from
34.3 ± 2.6% (mean ± SE) to 78.8 ± 2.1% and within CD3+/CD8+ T cells
from 36.3 ± 3.1% to 81.3 ± 2.2% at the time of product release. LCL
stimulation also markedly increased the number of CAR-T cells at
the time of harvest for product formulation and release. The median
fold expansions of CD3+/CD4+ and CD3+/CD8+ T cells between anti-
CD3/anti-CD28 bead stimulation and LCL stimulation were 10.4 (range,
2.5 to 35.9; n = 27) and 7.5 (range, 1.1 to 59.5; n = 28). Between LCL
stimulation and CAR-T cell product release, the median fold expan-
sions of CD3+/CD4+/EGFRt+ and CD3+/CD8+/EGFRt+ CAR-T cells
were 230.5 (range, 107.7 to 698.6; n = 28) and 198.9 (range, 29.3 to 458.6;
n = 29). This cell manufacturing strategy allowed a CAR-T cell product
to be prepared for all patients; however, 2 of the 32 patients did not
receive their target CAR-T cell dose. These two patients were assigned
to the top dose level of 2 × 107 CAR-T cells/kg and received CAR-T
cell doses of 8.8 × 106/kg and 7.0 × 106/kg. With the exception of
one additional patient who received 38.8 and 100% of the assigned
CD4+ and CD8+ CAR-T cell target doses, respectively, all other pa-
tients received a cell product with a CD4/CD8 CAR-T cell ratio of
1:1 in the dose specified for the cohort to which they were assigned.
The infused CAR-T cells were predominantly CD45RA−/CD62L+
and CD45RA−/CD62L− (fig. S2).

 Decreased antitransgene product immune responses and
enhanced CAR-T cell expansion in patients who received
cyclophosphamide/fludarabine lymphodepletion
The study evaluated three CAR-T cell dose levels administered 36
to 96 hours after lymphodepleting chemotherapy. Twelve patients
received chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide (Cy) or Cy and eto-
poside (Cy/E), followed by infusion of CAR-T cells with an overall re-
sponse rate (ORR) of 50% [one CR and five partial response (PR)]
(Table 1). In these patients, the peak numbers of CD4+ and CD8+
EGFRt+ CAR-T cells in the blood after adoptive transfer correlated with
the fraction of CD19+ bone marrow cells before lymphodepleting
chemotherapy [CD4+/EGFRt+, Spearman correlation (r) = 0.52 and
P = 0.082; CD8+/EGFRt+, r = 0.69 and P = 0.014] (Fig. 2, A and B).
B cell aplasia, defined as <0.01% CD19+ B cells of total white cells in
the blood, developed after CAR-T cell infusion in 11 of these 12 pa-
tients; however, we observed a loss of CAR-T cells and recovery of B
cells in the blood within 100 days in 9 of 10 patients who consented
to long-term monitoring. Eight of these patients developed progres-
sive disease, suggesting that longer CAR-T cell persistence may be
critical for durable antitumor efficacy. Five of the patients in this group
with persistent or progressive disease received a second CAR-T cell in-
fusion at the same dose (n = 1) or a 10-fold higher CAR-T cell dose
(n = 4). In all five patients, there was no observable CAR-T cell expan-
sion or persistence immediately after infusion (Fig. 2C), or measurable
antitumor activity. In five of five patients, cytotoxic T cell responses that
were specific for autologous T cells expressing the CAR transgene were
detected in the blood after CAR-T cell therapy, and in four patients, the
peptide epitopes that were recognized were mapped to sequences in
the murine single-chain variable frag-
ment (scFv) (fig. S3 and table S2).
We then administered Cy and fludara-
bine (Flu) for lymphodepletion before
CAR-T cell infusion in 20 subsequent pa-
tients to determine whether intensified im-
munosuppression would enhance CAR-T
cell expansion and persistence and prevent
or delay immune responses to the CAR.
Compared to the patients without Flu in
the lymphodepletion regimen, patients
who received Cy/Flu had higher serum
concentrations of interleukin-7 (IL-7) (P =
0.014) and IL-15 (P < 0.001) on the day of
CAR-T cell infusion, markedly greater ex-
pansion of CD4+ and CD8+ CAR-T cells
in the blood in the first 10 days after in-
fusion, and higher numbers of CAR-T
cells in the blood 1 and 3 months later
(Fig. 2, A and B, D to F). With the excep-
tion of patients who underwent autolo-
gous or allogeneic HCT after CAR-T cell
infusion, in whom CAR-T cells were not
detectable after HCT, 16 of the 18 patients
who received Cy/Flu lymphodepletion and
survived more than 28 days after CAR-T
cell infusion had detectable CAR-T cells
in the blood by QPCR (>10 copies/mg of
DNA) at the last follow-up (range, 34 to
349 days) (Fig. 2F). We identified a rela-
tionship between CAR-T cell dose and in vivo expansion in Cy/Flu-
lymphodepleted patients (Fig. 3, A and B) that was not apparent in
those who received Cy or Cy/E. Furthermore, unlike patients who ini-
tially received Cy or Cy/E lymphodepletion, three of four patients who
received Cy/Flu before their first CAR-T cell infusion and had a sec-
ond infusion to treat persistent disease had evidence of further tumor
regression after the second infusion (fig. S4); three patients exhibited
CAR-T cell expansion after the second infusion without developing a
detectable T cell immune response to the transgene product (Fig. 3C).
Together, these data demonstrate that Cy/Flu lymphodepletion en-
hances early proliferation and persistence of both CD4+ and CD8+
CAR-T cells with kinetics that are affected by the dose of CAR-T cells
infused and enables repetitive dosing of CAR-T cells.
Improved therapeutic efficacy of CAR-T cells in patients
who received Cy/Flu lymphodepletion
In the entire cohort of 32 patients, higher peak expansion and lon-
ger duration of CAR-T cell persistence in the blood were associated
with a greater probability of tumor regression (Fig. 3D). Consistent
with the increase in CAR-T cell expansion and persistence observed
with Cy/Flu lymphodepletion, we found that addition of Flu in the
lymphodepletion regimen was associated with improvement in the
depth of response (ordinal logistic regression, CR versus PR versus
NR; P = 0.02) (Table 1). The importance of CAR-T cell persistence
for ongoing tumor eradication was highlighted by the observation that
in six patients, the reduction in tumor burden at the initial restaging
performed 1 month after CAR-T cell infusion was not the maximal
response, and further tumor regression was observed on subsequent

 restaging studies (fig. S5). Cy/Flu lym-
phodepletion followed by infusion of 2 ×
106 CAR-T cells/kg was selected as the
preferred regimen for NHL patients be-
cause of the lower toxicity observed after
the 2 × 106/kg cell dose compared to the
2× 107/kg cell dose, and antitumor activity
in multiple histologies (Table 1 and table
S3). Although follow-up is short, patients
who received CAR-T cells at ≤2 × 106/kg
after Cy/Flu lymphodepletion had bet-
ter overall survival (OS; P = 0.17) and
progression-free survival (PFS; P = 0.008)
compared to those who received Cy or
Cy/E lymphodepletion (Fig. 3, E and F).
Only one of the nine patients who achieved
CR after Cy/Flu lymphodepletion and
infusion of CAR-T cells has relapsed
(follow-up, 2.3 to 11.2 months).
Toxicity of CD19 CAR-T cells
Patients were evaluated for immediate
and delayed toxicity of lymphodepleting
chemotherapy and CAR-T cell infusion.
Serious acute toxicity in the first 2 hours
after CAR-T cell infusion was not observed
at any CAR-T cell dose. A majority of pa-
tients developed the toxicities expected
with cytotoxic chemotherapy, including
bone marrow suppression, alopecia, mild
mucositis, and neutropenic fever. Deple-
tion of normal CD19+ B cells, consistent
with the in vivo presence of functional
CD19 CAR-T cells, was noted in 29 of
30 patients who survived until day 28.
Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and
neurotoxicity are serious toxicities that
have been observed in a subset of patients
with B cell malignancies who are treated
with CD19 CAR-T cells, and the factors
that predict the patients at greatest risk
for these toxicities have been difficult to
define (2, 4–8). We evaluated whether ad-
ministering a defined-composition CAR-T
cell product might facilitate identifying
patients who were more likely to develop
toxicity. Overall, 20 of 32 patients devel-
oped increased concentrations of serum
cytokines, fever, and/or hypotension con-
sistent with CRS. Severe CRS (sCRS), which
requires management in the intensive care
unit (ICU) and treatment with tocilizumab
(n = 3) and/or corticosteroids (n = 4), de-

observed in 9 of 32 patients (28%) and was
also more frequently observed in patients
who received Cy/Flu lymphodepletion.
Neurotoxicity presented as reversible en-
cephalopathy alone (n = 5) or with tremor
(n = 1) or speech disturbance (n = 1). Cho-
reoathetosis and fatal intracranial hemor-
rhage were observed in one patient each.
T cell dose was related to the development
of sCRS and neurotoxicity, with three of six
patients (50%) treated at 2 × 107 CAR-T
cells/kg after Cy/Flu lymphodepletion de-
veloping sCRS and four of six (67%) pa-
tients developing grade ≥3 neurotoxicity
(Table 1). Two patients who were treated
with 2 × 107 CAR-T cells/kg died: one pa-
tient developed a pontine hemorrhage,
and one patient had a fatal gastrointes-
tinal (GI) hemorrhage associated with a
known GI invasive lymphomatous mass.
Thus, the CAR-T cell dose of 2 × 107/kg
after Cy/Flu lymphodepletion was consid-
ered excessively toxic for NHL patients,
and subsequent patients were treated at
a lower dose level.

 Biomarkers and the risk of CRS and neurotoxicity
CRS is initiated by activation and proliferation of CAR-T cells after
recognition of CD19+ target cells (4). The peak number of CD4+/EGFRt+
and CD8+/EGFRt+ CAR-T cells in the
blood and the area under the curve of
CAR-T cell numbers (transgene copies
per microgram of DNA) between days
0 and 28 (AUC0–28) were associated with
the occurrence of sCRS (Fig. 4A). Peak ser-
um concentrations of IL-6, interferon-g
(IFN-g), ferritin, and C-reactive protein
(CRP) after CAR-T cell infusion corre-
lated with the occurrence and severity
of sCRS (Fig. 4B). The highest IL-6 and
IFN-g concentrations were observed in
patients who received Cy/Flu lymphode-
pletion followed by CAR-T cells infused
at 2 × 107/kg (Fig. 4C), consistent with
the higher incidence of toxicity observed
in these patients (Table 1). Patients who
developed grade ≥3 neurotoxicity had
higher AUC0–28, more peak CD4+/EGFRt+
and peak CD8+/EGFRt+ cells in the blood,
higher peak serum IL-6, IFN-g, IL-15, IL-2,
IL-18, TIM-3, ferritin, and CRP concentra-
tions, and lower serum transforming growth
factor–b (TGF-b) compared to those
without neurotoxicity (Fig. 4, D and E).
In multivariate analyses, peak numbers
of CD4+/EGFRt+ and CD8+/EGFRt+
cells, serum ferritin, and IL-6 had the
strongest associations with severe neu-
rotoxicity (table S4).
We evaluated serum biomarkers on
the first day after CAR-T cell infusion to
determine whether patients at highest risk
for subsequent severe toxicity might be
identifiable for early intervention. We found
higher IL-6, IFN-g, IL-15, IL-8, and IL-10
concentrations on day 1 after CAR-T cell
infusion in patients who subsequently
developed sCRS (Fig. 5A). Higher IL-6,
IFN-g, IL-15, IL-8, and IL-10 and lower
TGF-b concentrations were found in pa-
tients who subsequently developed severe
neurotoxicity, as compared to those who
did not (Fig. 5B), with the strongest asso-
ciations in multivariate analyses identi-
fied in patients with higher serum IL-6
and IL-15 concentrations (table S4). Fur-
thermore, receiver operating character-
istic (ROC) analyses identified serum
concentrations of IL-6 >15.2 pg/ml, IL-15
>76.7 pg/ml, and TGF-b <25,532 pg/ml
on day 1 as optimal discriminators of the
risk of severe neurotoxicity (Fig. 5, C to
E). Simultaneous or sequential use of more
than one of these cytokine assays resulted
in a net sensitivity of 97 to 100% and a net specificity of 95 to 99%, re-
spectively (table S5) (18). These data provide an opportunity for studying

DISCUSSION
CD19 CAR-T cell therapy represents an important therapeutic ad-
vance for patients with relapsed/refractory B cell NHL; however, the
optimal T cell dose and lymphodepletion
regimens to achieve durable efficacy and
the prediction and management of toxi-
cities remain to be elucidated. Systematically
studying these issues has been challeng-
ing because of small numbers of patients
and the differences in the phenotypic com-
position of CAR-T cell products admin-
istered to individual patients in previous
trials (2, 4–7). Our data show that formu-
lating a CAR-T cell product with a uni-
form CD4+/CD8+ CAR-T cell ratio for
NHL patients is feasible by selecting and
transducing individual T cell subsets, and
if administered at the maximum tolerated
dose after Cy/Flu conditioning, this ap-
proach results in marked tumor regression
in a majority of patients with low incidence
of serious toxicity. The strategy of select-
ing CD4+ and CD8+ T cell subsets before
transduction was applied to all patients
with an intent to treat basis, and no pa-
tient was excluded on the basis of the ab-
solute lymphocyte count, tumor burden,
or a pre-enrollment test expansion. This
strategy was successful in obtaining a
CAR-T cell product for 100% of enrolled
patients, and 91% of the patients received
the prescribed cell dose and formulation
of CAR-T cells. This high success rate in
preparing CAR-T cells in this heavily pre-
treated group of patients may reflect re-
moval of inhibitory cell subsets from the
leukapheresis product by selecting CD4+
and CD8+ T cells and/or the selective ex-
pansion of CAR-transduced T cells capable
of proliferating by the brief in vitro ex-
pansion with CD19+ EBV-LCL before cell
infusion. Additional improvements in
the cell manufacturing process might be
achieved using cytokines, such as IL-7,
IL-21, and/or IL-15, that have been re-
ported to improve the growth of human
T cells in vitro and enhance the therapeutic
efficacy of adoptively transferred murine T
cells in preclinical models (15, 19, 20).
We did not observe differences in CAR-T
cell expansion and persistence or clinical
outcomes between patients who received
CAR-T cells manufactured from CD4+ T
cells formulated with either CD8+ TCM-derived CAR-T cells or bulk
CD8+ T cell–derived CAR-T cells. Additional studies will be required
to define the optimal T cell subset(s) and formulation for CD19 CAR-T
cell therapy.
An important predictor of the antitumor efficacy of CD19 CAR-T
cells in NHL is their ability to expand and persist in vivo after adoptive
transfer. Our data show that CAR-T cell expansion was lower in
the subset of patients who received Cy or Cy/E lymphodepletion,

 and persistence was shorter in these patients due to the development
of an anti-CAR T cell immune response. Because all CD19 CARs used
in published clinical trials incorporate a murine scFv, our data provide
one potential mechanism for the loss of CAR-T cells observed in other
trials (2–7, 21–23). Intensification of lymphodepletion by addition of
Flu to Cy, as in our study, increased the peak of expansion, the AUC0–28,
and long-term persistence of infused CAR-T cells and improved the
CR rate, OS, and PFS. The specific mechanisms by which Flu in-
creased CAR-T cell accumulation and persistence are likely multi-
factorial, and our data indicate that they could include increased
homeostatic cytokine availability or reduction in the anti-CAR im-
mune response. An alternative possibility is that the addition of Flu
to Cy lymphodepletion might improve CAR-T cell proliferation by
reducing expression of indoleamine deoxygenase in the tumor micro-
environment (24). In a subset of patients, we observed an improvement
in clinical response between 1 and 3 months after initial restaging. Al-
though the timing of the peak of CAR-T cell expansion in the blood
did not differ between patients whose best tumor response was at the
first restaging or later, it is conceivable that Cy/Flu lymphodepletion
may enable prolonged persistence of functional CAR-T cells in the
tumor and ongoing antitumor activity. It is unknown whether inten-
sification of lymphodepletion using other chemotherapy regimens or
radiation would be similarly effective in augmenting CAR-T cell pro-
liferation and persistence.
We observed that treatment with the same lymphodepletion and
CD19 CAR-T cell immunotherapy regimen resulted in lower CR rates
in NHL and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients compared
to B-ALL patients (1, 25). The reasons for the differences are yet to be
determined but may include differences in CAR-T cell access to tumor
antigen and/or immune suppression in the tumor microenvironment
in each disease. A recent report suggested that T cells isolated from
patients with B-ALL, NHL, and CLL differ in their capacity to prolif-
erate in vitro to anti-CD3/anti-CD28 stimulation; however, it is not
known whether the reduced proliferative capacity of T cells isolated
from NHL and CLL patients translates to a difference in the in vivo
efficacy of infused CAR-T cell products from NHL and CLL patients,
as compared to B-ALL patients (15). The manufacturing strategy that
was used in our trial was highly successful in generating a cell product
from NHL patients, even those with reduced CD4+ and CD8+ T cell
numbers.
CD19 CAR-T cell therapy has been associated with toxicity in pub-
lished studies, and understanding factors that predict which patients
are at highest risk for toxicity is an area of intense interest (2, 4–6).
Here, the use of CAR-T cells of defined composition and the abroga-
tion of the anti-CAR immune response by Cy/Flu lymphodepletion
revealed a correlation between cell dose and in vivo CAR-T cell expan-
sion, which should facilitate more predictable cell dosing and better
definition of the therapeutic index. Severe toxicity due to CAR-T cells
in patients treated with Cy/Flu lymphodepletion was predominantly
seen at the 2 × 107/kg CAR-T cell dose. A reduction of the cell dose
to 2 × 106/kg reduced toxicity and achieved CR and ORR rates of 64
and 82%, respectively, which compares favorably to the 45% CR rate
observed in a recent report (6). Additional studies will be required to
determine whether the higher toxicity at a given CAR-T cell dose seen
in patients who received Cy/Flu lymphodepletion is due to greater
lymphodepletion and in vivo CAR-T cell expansion or whether Flu
directly increases toxicity by mechanisms that are not dependent
on CAR-T cell expansion. The peak CAR-T cell count in the blood
between days 0 and 28 after CAR-T cell infusion (Cmax) and AUC0–28
that was associated with CR were also associated with neurotoxicity
and sCRS, suggesting that further reducing the CAR-T cell dose to
minimize toxicity might also result in loss of efficacy. Despite delivery
of a consistent CAR-T cell product at a defined optimal dose(s), severe
toxicity may still occur in a minority of patients due to patient-specific
biological variation, such as may result from polymorphisms in cyto-
kine and cytokine receptor genes. In the serum of NHL patients col-
lected 1 day after CAR-T cell infusion, high IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-15,
and IFN-g concentrations were associated with the subsequent occur-
rence of sCRS and neurotoxicity, and low TGF-b concentration was
associated with neurotoxicity. Serum IL-6 and IFN-g concentrations
were also associated with subsequent toxicity in a cohort of B-ALL
patients who received the same lymphodepletion regimens and CAR-T
cell product in this study (1). Because IL-8, IL-10, IL-15, and TGF-b con-
centrations were not assessed in our B-ALL cohort, it remains un-
known whether these cytokines predict toxicity in B-ALL as well as
NHL patients. Our identification of biomarkers on day 1 after CAR-T
cell infusion that were associated with the subsequent occurrence of
severe toxicity provides an opportunity to test in a future clinical trial
whether early intervention strategies for suppressing cytokine release
or blocking cytokine receptors in high-risk patients may mitigate se-
vere toxicity.
This study reports a large series of NHL patients treated at a single
institution with CD19 CAR-T cells and demonstrates the feasibility of
selecting T cell subsets for CAR engineering and formulation of de-
fined therapeutic products from NHL patients for adoptive therapy.
The results show that delivery of a consistent CAR-T cell product is
feasible in an overwhelming majority of heavily pretreated patients,
provides high OR and CR rates, and allows identification of factors
that are important for optimizing CAR-T cell proliferation and per-
sistence and for reducing toxicity.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study design
We performed a phase 1 open-label trial to evaluate the feasibility and
safety of infusing a defined 1:1 ratio of CD4+/CD8+ CD19-specific
CAR-T cells in patients with relapsed or refractory CD19+ B cell ma-
lignancies. This article reports the data from NHL patients in the
study. Because of differences in disease characteristics and the re-
sponse to CAR-T cells, CLL and B-ALL patients were treated in dis-
tinct cohorts and reported separately (1, 25). The study is available
at https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01865617 and was con-
ducted with approval from the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research
Center institutional review board. Informed consent was obtained
from all patients after a discussion of the possible risks and adverse
effects of the therapy. In contrast to other studies, we did not ex-
clude any patient on the basis of the absolute lymphocyte count or
a previous assessment of T cell function (15).
T cell subset selection and CD19 CAR-T cell manufacturing
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were collected from
each patient by leukapheresis, and the product was divided into two
aliquots for enrichment of CD4+ and CD8+ T cell subsets on a Clin-
iMACS device for CAR-T cell manufacturing (fig. S1) (1, 26). Our
preclinical studies suggested that infusion of CD8+ TCM CAR-T cells

 combined with CD4+ CAR-T cells might provide optimal antitumor ef-
ficacy (13); therefore, CD8+ TCM cells were isolated from patients with an
absolute CD8+ TCM cell count of ≥20/ml using a two-step sequential de-
pletion of CD4+/CD14+/CD45RA+ cells followed by selection of CD62L+
cells. For patients with an absolute CD8+ TCM cell count of <20/ml, either
the CD62L+ selection was omitted or bulk CD8+ T cells were selected.
Enriched CD4+ and CD8+ T cell subsets were separately stimulated
with anti-CD3/anti-CD28 CTS paramagnetic beads (Dynabeads) and
transduced with a lentivirus encoding a CAR comprising an FMC63-
derived CD19-specific scFv fused to a modified immunoglobulin G4
hinge spacer, a CD28 transmembrane domain, a 4-1BB costimulatory
domain, and a CD3z signaling domain (13). A cell surface human
EGFRt was also encoded in the lentiviral vector separated from the
CAR cassette by a ribosomal skip sequence to allow precise enumeration
of transduced CD4+ and CD8+ CAR-T cells by flow cytometry (27, 28).
After removal of CD3/CD28 beads, the CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were
separately stimulated with a clinically qualified irradiated allogeneic
CD19+ LCL line and cultured in medium (RPMI 1640, 10% pooled
human serum, 3.5 mM L-glutamine, and 44 mM b-mercaptoethanol)
supplemented with IL-2 (50 U/ml). CAR-T cell manufacturing was
completed within about 15 days after initial bead stimulation. Quality
assessments were performed separately on the cultured CD4+ and CD8+
CAR-T cells, and the two fractions were formulated in a 1:1 ratio of
CD3+/CD4+/EGFRt+:CD3+/CD8+/EGFRt+ cells for infusion.
Lymphodepletion chemotherapy and CAR-T cell infusion
To deplete endogenous lymphocytes before adoptive transfer of
CAR-T cells, patients received one of four chemotherapy regimens: Cy,
2 to 4 g/m2 iv (intravenously) on day 1; Cy, 2 to 4 g/m2 iv on day 1 and
etoposide, 100 to 200 mg/m2 per day iv on days 1 to 3 (Cy/E); and Cy,
60 mg/kg iv on day 1 and fludarabine 25 mg/m2 per day iv on either
days 2 to 4 or days 2 to 6 (Cy/Flu). Between 36 and 96 hours after com-
pletion of chemotherapy, CAR-T cells were infused (intravenously) at or
as close as possible to one of three cell dose levels (2 × 105 EGFRt+
cells/kg, 2 × 106 EGFRt+ cells/kg, and 2 × 107 EGFRt+ cells/kg) (Table 1).
Clinical response assessment
Patients underwent whole-body imaging with diagnostic-quality com-
puted tomography and concurrent positron emission tomography before
and about 4 weeks after CAR-T cell therapy. Best responses to lympho-
depletion chemotherapy and a single CAR-T cell infusion are reported
according to the Lugano criteria (29). Marrow biopsies were obtained
before lymphodepletion and about 4 weeks after CAR-T cell infusion
from patients with marrow disease on initial staging. Toxicity was graded
using the NCI CTCAE version 4.03, with the exception of CRS, which
was defined as sCRS when ICU management was required.
CAR-T cell enumeration
Blood samples were obtained from patients before and at intervals af-
ter CAR-T cell infusion, and flow cytometry was performed to identify
CD4+ and CD8+ CAR-T cells as viable CD45+/CD3+/CD4+/EGFRt+ or
CD45+/CD3+/CD8+/EGFRt+ events, respectively. The absolute CAR-T
cell count was determined by multiplying the percentage of CAR-T
cells identified by flow cytometry in a lymphocyte forward scatter–side
scatter gate by the absolute lymphocyte count established by a
complete blood count performed on the same day. The area under
the curve of CAR-T cell numbers (transgene copies per microgram
of DNA) between days 0 and 28 (AUC0–28) was calculated using a
trapezoidal rule computational algorithm (30). Loss of CAR-T cell
persistence was defined as <10 copies/mg of DNA evaluated by QPCR
to detect integrated transgene sequence.

Serum concentrations of IFN-g, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-15, and TGF-b were
evaluated by Luminex assay, according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Anti-CAR immune response
We evaluated CD8+ T cell immune responses to the CAR transgene
using a modification of an assay we previously described (31). Cryo-
preserved PBMCs collected from patients before lymphodepletion
chemotherapy and about 4 weeks after CAR-T cell infusion were stim-
ulated twice at 7-day intervals with autologous irradiated CAR-T cells
and IL-2. The preinfusion and postinfusion PBMC cultures were
assayed for lysis of autologous CAR-T cells and autologous nontrans-
duced T cells in a chromium release assay. An immune response against
the CAR transgene was defined as the presence of specific lysis of au-
tologous CAR-T cells by postinfusion PBMC cultures but not of autol-
ogous nontransduced T cells or autologous CAR-T cells by preinfusion
PBMC cultures. A T cell line that exhibited specific lysis of autologous
CAR-T cells was stimulated with pools of overlapping peptides from
the CAR construct, and peptide pools that induced IFN-g secretion
higher than that induced by T cells alone in an enzyme-linked immu-
nospot assay were identified. Predictions of major histocompatibility
complex class I binding by peptides shared between the candidate
pools were made using the Immune Epitope Database and Analysis
Resource Consensus tool (32), which combines predictions from
NetMHC (3.4) (33, 34), SMM (35), and Comblib (36).
Statistical analysis
Comparisons of continuous variables between two categories were made
using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Relationships between continuous
variables were analyzed using Spearman correlation (r). Univariate (with
Firth correction) and stepwise multivariate logistic regression were per-
formed to assess predictors for the occurrence of severe neurotoxicity,
where log10 values were used to transform data as appropriate (for cyto-
kine concentrations and CD4+/EGFRt+ and CD8+/EGFRt+ cell counts),
with 0.01 substituting for values of 0. All P values reported were two-
sided, and no adjustments were made for multiple comparisons. ROC
curves were constructed using the empirical method, and the optimal
cut point was established on the basis of the Youden index (37). For
time-to-event analyses, the Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate
survival distributions, and the reverse Kaplan-Meier method was used
to estimate median follow-up time (38); log-rank tests were used to
compare between-group differences in survival curves.
