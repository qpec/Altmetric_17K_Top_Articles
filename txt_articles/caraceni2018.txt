Summary
Background Evidence is scarce on the efficacy of long-term human albumin (HA) administration in patients with 
decompensated cirrhosis. The human Albumin for the treatmeNt of aScites in patients With hEpatic ciRrhosis 
(ANSWER) study was designed to clarify this issue.
Methods We did an investigator-initiated multicentre randomised, parallel, open-label, pragmatic trial in 33 academic 
and non-academic Italian hospitals. We randomly assigned patients with cirrhosis and uncomplicated ascites who 
were treated with anti-aldosteronic drugs (≥200 mg/day) and furosemide (≥25 mg/day) to receive either standard 
medical treatment (SMT) or SMT plus HA (40 g twice weekly for 2 weeks, and then 40 g weekly) for up to 18 months. 
The primary endpoint was 18-month mortality, evaluated as difference of events and analysis of survival time in 
patients included in the modified intention-to-treat and per-protocol populations. This study is registered with 
EudraCT, number 2008–000625–19, and ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01288794.
Findings From April 2, 2011, to May 27, 2015, 440 patients were randomly assigned and 431 were included in the 
modified intention-to-treat analysis. 38 of 218 patients died in the SMT plus HA group and 46 of 213 in the SMT 
group. Overall 18-month survival was significantly higher in the SMT plus HA than in the SMT group (Kaplan-Meier 
estimates 77% vs 66%; p=0·028), resulting in a 38% reduction in the mortality hazard ratio (0·62 [95% CI 0·40–0·95]). 
46 (22%) patients in the SMT group and 49 (22%) in the SMT plus HA group had grade 3–4 non-liver related 
adverse events.
Interpretation In this trial, long-term HA administration prolongs overall survival and might act as a disease 
modifying treatment in patients with decompensated cirrhosis.

Introduction
Cirrhosis of the liver is a leading cause of disability and 
mortality worldwide.1,2 In Europe, 170 000 individuals die 
from cirrhosis every year, accounting for 1·8% of all 
deaths, and a similar proportion has been reported from 
the USA.3,4 Complications, such as ascites, gastrointestinal 
bleeding, hepatic encephalopathy, and jaundice, herald 
the decompensation of cirrhosis—the final stage of the 
disease.5 Decompensated cirrhosis carries a poor 
prognosis because the median survival time is about 
2 years, and it imposes a heavy burden on health-care 
costs, mainly due to the need for repeated hospital 
admissions.5,6
The current approach to patients with decompen-
sated cirrhosis relies on the individual management of 
each complication. Therefore, there is an unmet need 
for an overall therapeutic strategy able to prevent the 
dev 
elopment of complications, thus reducing hospital 
re 
admissions and costs, and improving quality of life 
and survival.
Long-term human albumin (HA) administration to 
patients with ascites, the most common cause of de-
compensation,7 has been debated for decades. Because 
reduced serum albumin concentration is commonly 
seen in patients with advanced cirrhosis, a putative 
rationale underlying HA use relies on the belief that an 
improve 
ment in hypoalbuminaemia would slow down 
ascites formation by increasing plasma colloid-osmotic 
pressure. However, hypoalbuminaemia per se does not 
have a pre-eminent pathogenetic role in this process 
because the colloid-osmotic pressure gradient, a factor 
regulating fluid partition between plasma and the 
interstitial space, is not reduced in cirrhosis with ascites.8 
Moreover, normalisation of serum colloid-osmotic 
pressure achieved by repeated HA administrations 
did not ensure a persistent control of ascites once

abdominal fluid had been resolved by diuretics.9 Effective 
hypo 
volaemia due to peripheral arterial vasodilation is 
a hallmark of decom 
pensated cirrhosis, leading to 
renal sodium and water retention that favours ascites 
formation.10 Therefore, a beneficial effect of HA might 
result from blood volume expansion, which would taper 
activated vasoconstrictor and sodium-retaining systems 
and improve renal per 
fusion. Sustained systemic 
inflammation and pro-oxidant state have been shown 
to contribute to circulatory and extrahepatic organ 
dysfunctions in advanced cirr 
hosis.11 HA exerts non-
oncotic properties, such as anti 
oxidant and scavenging 
activities, binding and transport of exogenous and 
endogenous substances, and regu 
lation of endothelial 
function and inflammatory or immune res 
ponses.12 
Such properties would make HA potentially able to 
target several pathophysiological mech 
anisms under-
lying decompensated cirrhosis, providing another 
reason for the use of HA with the broader target of 
preventing complications, besides improving the 
management of ascites.
The effects of adding long-term HA administration to 
diuretic therapy in decompensated cirrhosis have been 
assessed by only one research group in two prospective 
controlled clinical trials. In the first trial, HA adminis 
tration 
after hospital discharge at a dose of 25 g every week for 
1 year and 25 g every 2 weeks for the following 2 years, 
reduced the probability of developing ascites and hospital 
readmissions, with no effect on survival.13 The second trial 
extended patient follow-up to a median of 84 months, 
reporting improved transplant-free survival.14 However, 
the small sample size precluded a firm conclusion, and 
current guidelines do not support such a treatment.15,16
With this background and our large randomised clinical 
trial, we aimed to assess the effect of long-term HA 
administration on overall mortality, management of 
ascites, and incidence of complications in patients with 
decompensated cirrhosis. Health-care costs and quality of 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
We searched PubMed for full papers in any language published 
in peer-reviewed journals up to Feb 19, 2018, with the term 
“liver cirrhosis” subsequently filtered by “ascites”, “human 
albumin”, and “clinical trial”. Among 122 publications retrieved, 
two reported the results of randomised clinical trials assessing 
the effects of long-term human albumin (HA) in patients with 
cirrhosis and ascites, whereas the others dealt with single or 
short-term HA administration to prevent or treat specific acute 
complications of the disease. In the first study, published in 
1999, HA given at a dose of 25 g every week for 1 year and 25 g 
every 2 weeks for the next 2 years reduced the probability of 
developing ascites and hospital readmissions, with no effect on 
survival. An improved transplant-free survival was instead 
reported by the second study, published in 2006, by the same 
research group, in which patient follow-up was extended to a 
median of 84 months. However, the small sample size precluded 
a firm conclusion, so that current guidelines do not support such 
a treatment.
Added value of this study
The ANSWER study, an investigator-initiated multicentre 
randomised, parallel, open-label, pragmatic trial, is the first 
adequately powered study to assess the effects of long-term 
HA administration in patients with cirrhosis and 
uncomplicated ascites. Patients received either standard 
medical treatment (SMT, n=213) or SMT plus HA (40 g twice 
weekly for 2 weeks, and then 40 g weekly; n=218) for up to 
18 months.
The all-cause 18-month mortality, the primary endpoint of the 
study, was evaluated as difference of events and analysis of 
survival time. The incidence rate of mortality was significantly 
lower in the SMT plus HA group than in the SMT group. 
Consistently, the overall 18-month survival was significantly 
higher in the SMT plus HA group than in the SMT group, 
resulting in a 38% reduction in the mortality hazard ratio.
The SMT plus HA group also had significantly reduced incidence 
rates of paracentesis, refractory ascites, spontaneous bacterial 
peritonitis or other bacterial infections, episodes of renal 
dysfunction, hepatorenal syndrome type 1, and hepatic 
encephalopathy grade 3–4, whereas the incidence rate of 
gastro-oesophageal variceal bleeding was similar in the 
two groups. Finally, SMT plus HA was associated with a better 
quality of life and fewer hospital admissions than the SMT group, 
contributing to a favourable incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. 
The expected result of long-term HA administration to patients 
with decompensated cirrhosis is conventionally believed to be a 
better management of ascites than SMT, as convincingly shown 
by the ANSWER study. However, and more importantly, it shows 
that long-term HA treatment also reduces the incidence of 
potentially fatal complications of end-stage liver disease, 
ultimately leading to an improved survival. Notably, this 
therapeutic approach appears to be cost-effective.
Implications of all the available evidence
The ANSWER study results are clinically relevant. Indeed, they 
might prompt a change in HA use from targeting specific 
complications to a more comprehensive approach aimed at 
slowing down the progression of decompensated cirrhosis by 
acting as a disease-modifying treatment. Long-term HA 
administration unavoidably requires the use of health-care 
services and a careful patient compliance. However, the clinical 
advantages achieved and the favourable results of 
cost-effectiveness analysis can justify the implementation of this 
management strategy. Future research should clarify whether 
some patient subgroups would benefit most from long-term 
HA treatment and whether different doses and timing schedules 
might be more effective than those used in the present study.

Methods
Study design
The human Albumin for the treatmeNt of aScites in 
patients With hEpatic ciRrhosis (ANSWER) study was an 
investigator-initiated multicentre randomised, parallel, 
open-label, pragmatic trial done in 33 academic and non-
academic Italian hospitals. Study protocol, amendments 
(appendix), and the informed consent process were first 
approved by the ethics committee at the coordinat-
ing centre (University of Bologna, S Orsola-Malpighi 
Hospital, Bologna, Italy) and then at each participating 
centre. This study fulfils the requirements of the 
CONSORT check list.17 We also self-reviewed the trial 
design and conduct using the Cochrane risk of bias tool 
(appendix).18
Participants
The target trial population comprised patients with 
cirrhosis and persistent uncomplicated ascites despite 
ongoing diuretic treatment, who were recruited at partici-
pating hospitals during hospital admissions or visits 
at outpatient clinics. Written informed consent was ob-
tained from all patients and informants. The inclusion 
criteria were, diagnosis of liver cirrhosis with uncompli-
cated ascites; ongoing diuretic treatment with an anti-
aldosteronic drug (at a dose ≥200 mg/day and furosemide 
≥25 mg/day), stable for at least 4 days before enrolment; 
and oesophagogastroduodenoscopy done in the past 
12 months, abdominal ultrasonography done in the past 
30 days, and laboratory tests required by the protocol in 
the past 7 days. Participants younger than 18 years 
were excluded. 
The main exclusion criteria aimed to avoid the en-
rolment of patients with refractory ascites, recent 
com 
plications of cirrhosis, transjugular intrahepatic 
porto 
systemic shunt (TIPS), active hepatocellular carci-
noma, liver transplantation, ongoing alcohol abuse, 
extrahepatic organ failure, and albumin use for the 
treatment of ascites in the month preceding enrolment. 
For a more detailed list of the exclusion criteria and 
the diagnostic criteria defining cirrhosis, ascites, and 
complications see the appendix.
Randomisation and masking
At the statistical data centre, eligible patients were 
randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either standard medi-
cal treatment (SMT) or SMT plus HA with a computer-
generated and blinded assignment sequence with 
randomly permuted blocks of four, stratified accord-
ing to the need for therapeutic paracentesis in the 
month preceding enrolment (yes or no) and natraemia 
(<135 mmol/L and ≥135 mmol/L). A placebo controlled 
trial was not ethically justified because of the absence 
of safe alternatives to HA. Neither patients, nor 
investigators, nor statisticians were masked to treatment 
assignment. The entire statistical analysis was done once 
the database had been definitively frozen.
Procedures
SMT was aligned with the indications from the available 
clinical practice guidelines.15,16,19 According to the inclusion 
criteria, patients entering the study had to be treated with 
an anti-aldosteronic drug (at a dose ≥200 mg/day) and 
furosemide (≥25 mg/day). Details on patient SMT are 
reported in the appendix.
Patients enrolled in the SMT plus HA group received 
an intravenous infusion of 20% HA in 50 mL vials in 
approximately 30–60 min at a dose of 40 g twice weekly 
for the initial 2 weeks, and 40 g weekly thereafter. The 
first dose was administered within 24 h after 
randomisation. According to protocol, HA was infused 
by nursing personnel in outpatient settings, such as 
hospital clinics, local health centres, or home-care 
services according to available facilities, whereas patients 
admitted to hospital received HA on the scheduled date 
during their hospital stay.
No concomitant medications were forbidden during the 
study. Additional information about causes and other 
treatments during the study are reported in the appendix.
After enrolment, patients were assessed monthly for up 
to 18 months or study interruption or death. At each visit, 
clinical, laboratory, and instrumental data (if needed) were 
collected by the attending physicians, including interviews

on dietary sodium and alcohol intake, which could be 
extended to relatives. Data were recorded on an electronic 
case report form accessible via the internet. The study was 
interrupted when patients underwent liver transplantation 
or TIPS insertion, needed three or more therapeutic 
paracenteses per month (the reason for this criterion is 
detailed in the appendix), or refused to continue their 
participation in the study, or because of medical judgment.
Quality of life was assessed with the visual-analogue 
scale (VAS) and the utility index from the EuroQol Group 
5-Dimension Self-Report Questionnaire (EQ-5D).20,21 Con-
trary to what was planned in the study protocol, the Short 
Form 36 questionnaires were not used to assess quality of 
life because the number of questionnaires adequately 
completed was insufficient.
Adverse events were assessed at every visit from the 
time of first HA administration, and serious adverse 
events were monitored throughout the study. All adverse 
events were coded according to the Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0. The severity and 
relation of adverse events to HA were reported according 
to the investigator’s opinion.
Outcomes
The primary endpoint was 18-month mortality. The 
secondary endpoints were, (1) number of thera 
peutic 
paracenteses; (2) cumulative diuretic dosage; (3) hypo-
natraemia (serum sodium concentration <130 mmol/L) 
or 
hyperkalaemia 
(serum 
potassium concen 
tration 
≥5·5 mmol/L) as potential diuretic-induced side-effects; 
(4) incidence of cirrhosis-related complications (refract-
ory ascites, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis [SBP], other 
bacterial infections, renal impairment [serum creat-
inine concentration >1·5 mg/dL], hepatorenal syndrome 
[HRS] type 1, hepatic encephalopathy grade 3 or 4, and 
gastrointestinal bleeding related to portal hypertension); 
(5) need for three or more paracenteses per month; 
(6) quality of life; (7) number and duration of hospital 
admissions; and (8) treatment cost-effectiveness.
According to the study protocol, specific disease-related 
adverse events and serious adverse events were collected 
and documented as part of the clinical outcomes and 
hence were considered waived from expedited reporting 
to the Regulatory Authorities (appendix).
Statistical analysis
We assumed that the 18-month all-cause mortality would 
be 35% in the SMT group (according to the control group 
of a randomised clinical trial enrolling patients with 
clinical features similar to those of the patients in the 
present study)22 and 20% in the SMT plus HA group. We 
assumed a drop rate of 4% per month and that patients 
were randomly assigned with 1:1 ratio, with a two-sided 
type 1 error rate of 5%. Based on these assumptions, 
210 patients per group were needed to ensure 90% power.
An interim analysis was planned in the protocol once 
half the patient sample size had completed the study

(appendix). The final analysis was done on a modified 
intention-to-treat population. Descriptive statistics were 
generated for all variables. We used a χ² test to compare 
categorical variables between SMT and SMT plus HA 
groups; we compared continuous variables using an 
unpaired t test, Welch’s test, or Mann-Whitney U test, as 
appropriate. We calculated the median follow-up period 
according to the reverse Kaplan-Meier method.23
The primary efficacy endpoint, 18-month mortality, 
was defined as the number of deaths due to any cause 
during the follow-up or the time from randomisation to 
death from any cause. We assessed mortality by 
two methods: ratio of the number of observed deaths in 
person-18 months at risk of the event and analysis of 
survival time. We analysed all time-to-event distributions 
using the Kaplan-Meier’s method (K-M), assessing 
differences with log-rank test. We calcu 
lated risk factors 
associated with survival by Cox proportional-hazards 
regression: hazard ratios (HR) and 95% CI were 
estimated after confirmation of the proportional-hazards 
assumption. The univariate Cox proportional-hazards 
model was fit for all demo 
graphic and baseline variables 
consid 
ered relevant or clinically meaningful; we further 
analysed the factors showing statistical significance (at 
α level 0·10) as a predictor in univariate Cox proportional-
hazard reg 
ression using a multivariable model with 
backward selection of variables based on the Akaike 
information criterion.
To assess secondary outcomes, we computed incidence 
rates and 95% CI using the exact method on the basis of 
the Poisson distribution. Subsequently, to compare the 
incidence rates in the two groups, we calculated the 
incidence rate ratios and 95% CI using the SMT group as 
the reference category.
We did a post-hoc competing risks analysis to test 
possible effects of liver transplantation and TIPS 
placement on the primary outcome.24 We did the same 
analysis, including all-cause deaths and TIPS placement 
or liver transplantation, to assess the treatment effect on 
the first occurrence of complications included in the 
secondary outcomes (appendix).
All reported p values are two-sided unless otherwise 
specified, and confidence intervals are at the 95% level. 
Further details on the statistical methods are provided in 
the appendix.
We analysed cost-effectiveness by calculating quality-
adjusted life-years (QALY) from the EQ-5D utility index 
and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). 
According to the National Institute for Health and Care 
Excellence (NICE),25 an ICER of €35 000 per QALY was 
taken as the threshold to consider a treatment cost-
effective. We also did a non-parametric bootstrap analysis 
to test the robustness of the preliminary cost-effectiveness 
assessment (appendix).26

involved in the study (appendix). Per-protocol HA was 
supplied by a company pool (Baxalta, CSL Behring, Biotest 
Italia, Grifols Italia, Kedrion Biopharma) according to 
Italian legislation governing non-profit trials.
The study was registered in the European Clinical Trial 
Database (EudraCT2008-000625-19) and ClinicalTrials.
gov (NCT01288794).
Role of the funding source
The trial was funded by a competitive peer-reviewed 
grant from the Italian Medicine Agency. The funder had 
no role in study design, data collection, data analysis, 
data interpretation, or writing of the report. The 
corresponding author had full access to all the data in the 
study and had final responsibility for the decision to 
submit for publication.
Results
From April 2, 2011, to May 27, 2015, 440 patients were 
randomly assigned to receive either SMT (n=220) or SMT 
plus HA (n=220). Six patients, who were withdrawn from 
the study within 30 days from enrollment, were excluded 
because of wrong inclusion, and three patients, who did 
not receive any treatment, were excluded because of 
consent withdrawal. Therefore, the modified intention-to-
treat analysis included 213 patients in the SMT group and 
218 in the SMT plus HA group (figure 1). Data on screened 
patients were incomplete in many participating centres, so 
comprehensive information about screening cannot be 
provided. However, screening was properly recorded at 
four highly recruiting centres where data were gathered 
(appendix). Baseline demographic, clinical, and laboratory 
features were well balanced between the two groups 
(table 1). 41 patients in the SMT group and 42 in the SMT 
plus HA group ended their follow-up prematurely. 
Thus, 172 patients in SMT group and 176 patients in SMT 
plus HA group completed the study according to the pre-
specified causes of study termination (per-protocol 
population). Although liver transplantation and TIPS 
placement were similar between the two groups, patients 
receiving SMT had a more frequent need for three or more 
paracenteses per month and had more deaths than those 
receiving SMT plus HA (figure 1) There were 46 deaths, 
18 liver transplantations, 8 TIPS placements, and 
42 needing three or more paracenteses per month in the 
SMT group and 38 deaths, 19 liver transplantations, 6 TIPS 
placements, and 18 needing three or more paracenteses 
per month in the SMT plus HA group. As a result, the 
follow-up was significantly shorter in the SMT group 
(median 11·5 months [IQR 3·3–17·8] vs 17·6 months 
[IQR 8·0–18·0]; p=0·005). Details on the causes of 
premature study termination and deaths and protocol 
adherence are reported in the appendix.
In the SMT plus HA group, long-term HA administration 
was associated with a significant increase in mean serum 
albumin concentration from a baseline concentration of 
3·1 g/dL to about 4 g/dL within 1–2 months (p<0·0001), 
whereas no change occurred in the SMT group. Thereafter, 
serum albumin concentration remained stable and 
significantly higher in the SMT plus HA group than in the 
SMT group, with a gap fluctuating between 0·6 and 
0·8 g/dL (p<0·0001; figure 2).
The 18-month all-cause mortality rate was significantly 
lower in the SMT plus HA group (0·27 deaths per 
person-18 months [95% CI 0·19–0·37]) than in the SMT 
group (0·44 [95% CI 0·32–0·80]), leading to an incidence 
rate ratio of 0·61 (95% CI 0·39–0·96; p=0·027). 
Consistently, patients receiving HA had a significantly 
higher 18-month probability of overall survival than did 
those treated with SMT alone (K-M 77% SMT plus HA vs 
66% SMT; p=0·0285; figure 3), corresponding to a 38% re-
duction in the mortality HR (0·62 [95% CI 0·40–0·95]).

all-cause mortality (incidence rate 0·30 [95% CI 0·21–0·41]

in SMT plus HA group; incidence rate 0·48 [0·35–0·64] in 
SMT group; incidence rate ratio 0·62 [0·39–0·98]; 
p=0·036) and overall survival (HR 0·63 [0·41–0·98]; 
K-M 75% SMT plus HA vs 64% SMT; p=0·037) was also 
observed in the per-protocol population. Univariate 
analysis (appendix) and multivariable Cox proportional 
hazard model (appendix) showed that age, viral cause of 
cirrhosis, Child-Pugh, and Model for End-Stage Liver 
Disease score incorporating serum sodium concentration 
were independent predictors of all-cause mortality, 
whereas receiving SMT plus HA was the sole protective 
factor. Finally, multivariable Cox regression analysis 
estimated that seven patients (95% CI 5–19) were to be 
treated to avoid death at 18 months. Notably, the mixed 
effect Cox model showed a non-significant centre effect on 
primary outcome.
The competing risks analysis, including TIPS place-
ment or liver transplantation as competing events with 
mortality, showed that the cumulative incidence of death 
was significantly reduced in the SMT plus HA group 
(figure 4A). Multivariable competing risks analysis, 
including the same set of factors selected in the multi-
variable Cox proportional hazard model, supported the 
independent protective role of HA administration against 
all-cause mortality (figure 4B). The analysis done, 
including liver-related mortality, non-liver-related mor-
tality, and TIPS placement or liver transplantation, 
showed that the effect of HA administration was specific 
for liver-related deaths (figure 5).
Ascites control was substantially eased by long-term 
HA administration. Indeed, 71 patients had at least one 
paracentesis in the SMT plus HA group and 116 in the 
SMT group. The probability of remaining free of 
paracentesis throughout the study was almost twice in 
the SMT plus HA group (HR 0·48 [95% CI 0·35–0·54]; 
K-M 62% SMT plus HA vs 34% SMT; p<0·0001) 
(figure 6A). Furthermore, the incidence rate of 
paracentesis in the SMT group was 3·50 cases per 
person-year (95% CI 3·21–3·80), which fell by 54% in 
patients receiving SMT plus HA (incidence rate 1·55 
[95% CI 1·39–1·73]; incidence rate ratio 0·46 [95% CI 
0·40–0·53]; p<0·0001). The mean volume tapped per 
each paracentesis did not differ between the two groups 
(SMT, 5·5 L [SD 2·1]; SMT plus HA, 5·7 L [SD 2·1]; 
p=0·51). Finally, the cumulative diuretic doses were 
similar in the two groups (appendix).
The cumulative incidence of refractory ascites was 
0·25 in the SMT plus HA group and 0·48 in the SMT 
group (p<0·0001), with a 57% risk reduction (HR 0·43 
[95% CI 0·29–0·62]; p<0·0001) (figure 6B).
Consistently, the cumulative incidence of the endpoint 
need for three or more paracenteses per month was 
lower in the SMT plus HA group than in the SMT group 
(K-M 12% vs 29%; p<0·0001), with a 67% risk reduction 
(HR 0·33 [95% CI 0·19–0·58]; p<0·0001). Notably, the 
mean volume of ascites tapped for each of the last three 
paracenteses did not differ between the two groups 
(SMT, 6·22 L [SD 1·58]; SMT plus HA, 6·71 L [SD 1·50]; 
p=0·27).
Besides the benefit on ascites management, long-term 
HA administration appeared to protect patients against 
many other complications of cirrhosis. The incidence 
rate ratio of SBP, non-SBP bacterial infections, renal dys-
function, HRS type 1, hepatic encephalopathy grade 3 or 4, 
and potential diuretic-induced side-effects, such as 
hyponatraemia and hyperkalaemia, documented that the 
cumulative incidence of these complications was signifi-
cantly reduced by 30 to 67·5% in patients receiving SMT 
plus HA (figure 7). Bleeding from gastro-oeso 
phageal 
varices did not differ between the two groups; however, a 
non-significant trend to a higher incidence of other 
portal-hypertensive bleeds (congestive gastropathy or 
haemorrhoids) was seen in the SMT plus HA group 
(figure 7).
The cumulative incidence of major complications 
was also assessed by a competing risks analysis in 
which all-cause mortality and TIPS placement or liver

ation were the competing events. This 
analysis showed a beneficial effect conferred by HA 
administration on refractory ascites and the first 
occurrence of HRS type 1, SBP, and hepatic 
encephalopathy grade 3 or 4, whereas no effect was 
seen on the first occurrence of non-SBP bacterial 
infections and bleeding from gastro-oesophageal 
varices (appendix).
Quality of life throughout the follow-up, as assessed by 
mean values of EQ-5D utility index and VAS, remained 
roughly steady in the SMT plus HA group, whereas it 
declined to a significant extent from 3 to 12 months in 
the SMT group (appendix). The number of hospital 
admissions and days spent in hospital per patient in a 
year were significantly reduced in the SMT plus HA 
group by 35% and 45% with respect to the SMT group 
(table 2). Liver-related and non-liver-related causes of 
hospital admissions are reported in the appendix. For the 
cost-effectiveness analysis, direct health-care costs were 
based on the tariffs of the Italian National Health Service 
and included hospital admissions, procedures for per-
protocol HA infusion, amount of HA administered for 
any reason, and paracentesis. The extra cost related to 
the per-protocol HA administration in the SMT plus 
HA group was largely counterbalanced by savings 
derived from fewer hos 
pital admissions and paracent-
eses, and less HA use for established indications, 
such as prevention of paracentesis-induced circulatory 
dys 
function and SBP-induced renal dysfunction, and

treatment of HRS type 1. As a result, an incremental cost 
of €2488/year was seen in the SMT plus HA group. 
Because the incremental health benefit achieved in the 
SMT plus HA group, estimated by the gain of QALY, was 
0·117 QALY per year, the ICER was €21 265 per QALY 
(appendix). The bootstrap analysis produced even more 
favourable results. In 56% of the 10 000 simulations, 
long-term HA administration resulted in cost-saving 
compared with SMT alone. Moreover, 92·5% of all 
simulations presented an ICER of less than €35 000 per 
QALY (appendix).
Adverse events temporally related to HA infusion 
included two mild allergic reactions consisting of 
erythema and pruritus, one episode of dizziness with 
transient arterial hypotension, and two severe sepsis 
cases. In the two cases of severe sepsis, bacteriological 
analysis of HA batches did not reveal contamination, and 
concomitant pneumonia was diagnosed in one case. All 
patients fully recovered (appendix). None of the un-
anticipated grade 3 and 4 adverse events considered 
unrelated to cirrhosis exceeded the 5% frequency 
threshold within SMT and SMT plus HA groups (table 3). 
The non-liver-related serious adverse events requiring 
admission to hospital are listed in the appendix.
Discussion
The present randomised, multicentre, pragmatic trial is 
the first prospective study providing robust evidence for 
a survival advantage conferred by the addition of long-
term HA administration to the standard-of-care in a 
large cohort of patients with cirrhosis and uncomplicated 
ascites. This statement is supported by the findings 
that HA administration significantly reduced overall 
mortality rate, thus improving 18-month survival. The 
benefit of HA administration was supported when TIPS 
placement and liver transplantation were considered 
competing risk events. Moreover, long-term HA treat-
ment was the sole independent protective factor against 
mortality at competing risks multivariable analysis and 
this advantage was specific to liver-related deaths. The 
fact that only seven patients had to be treated to save a 
life heightens the clinical relevance of these results.
An improved survival of patients with cirrhosis and 
first-onset ascites receiving long-term HA was reported 
after a median follow-up of 84 months by a single-centre 
randomised trial14 more than a decade ago. However, its 
small patient sample size precluded the adoption of this 
treatment by current clinical practice guidelines.15,16 We 
believe that the much larger, adequately powered patient 
sample size, and the more stringent methods adopted

in the present trial overcome the main limitations of 
that study.
Our study also provided other major findings. HA 
administration eased the management of ascites by 
significantly reducing the need for therapeutic para-
centesis. The decision to perform paracentesis might 
be largely influenced by the subjective judgment of 
attending physicians. Therefore, the fact that the amount 
of ascitic fluid withdrawn per paracentesis was the same in 
the two groups of our study is notable, suggest 
ing a fairly 
standard behaviour among investigators. The favourable 
effect of HA administration on ascites management is also 
testified by the significant reductions in the incidence of 
refractory ascites and diuretic-related side-effects, such as 
renal dysfunction, hyponatraemia, and hyperkalaemia, in 
the SMT plus HA group. Even more importantly, the 
incidence of ominous complications of cirrhosis, such as 
SBP and non-SBP-related bacterial infections, HRS type 1, 
and severe hepatic encephalopathy, was also strikingly 
reduced. These results were reinforced by the competing 
risks analyses showing that HA administration was 
associated with a delay in the occurrence of the first 
episodes of these complications apart from non-SBP 
bacterial infections. These effects probably represented the 
basis for the improved survival of patients receiving long-
term HA. The diagnosis of hepatic encephalopathy 
and non-SBP bacterial infections must be recognised 
as difficult and potentially influenced by subjective 
interpretation. To temper these potential sources of bias, 
we only recorded the episodes of hepatic encephalopathy 
grade 3 and 4, with which clinical evidence is more 
straight 
forward, and used prespecified diagnostic criteria 
for non-SBP bacterial infections that follow those used in 
many studies specifically dealing with this issue.27,28
Bleeding from oesophageal varices, likely to be caused 
by blood volume expansion after the prolonged admin-
istration of huge amounts of HA (up to 100 g/day), was 
reported many years ago in anecdotal series.9,29,30 Thus, 
another important finding is that gastro-oesophageal 
variceal bleeding and related deaths were not increased 
by the HA dose given in the present study. We observed a 
non-significantly higher incidence of other portal-
hypertensive bleeds—ie, from portal gastropathy and 
haemorrhoids—with a higher hospital admission rate, 
without any increase in the related mortality. Whether or 
not this result is favoured by the mild anti-platelet 
aggregation effect of HA31 remains to be determined.
The nature of this study cannot unveil the mech-
anisms underlying HA benefit. However, HA could have 
mitigated effective hypovolaemia, which is a major 
pathogenic factor for ascites formation inducing renal 
sodium retention and endangering renal perfusion.10 
This mitigation would explain a better control of ascites 
and related complications, such as renal impairment, 
electrolyte disturbances, HRS type 1, and SBP. Moreover, 
HA non-oncotic properties could have antagonised 
mechanisms, leading to the systemic inflammation 
and immune dysfunction characterising decompensated 
cirrhosis.11,12 This result would account for the significant 
reduced incidence of complications not closely linked to

haemodynamic alterations, such as hepatic encephalo-
pathy and non-SBP bacterial infections. Whether a serum 
albumin concentration threshold needs to be reached to 
achieve therapeutic effects from HA supplementation 
warrants further studies. A significant and sustained 
increase in serum albumin concentration was seen in the 
SMT plus HA group with respect to SMT. This difference 
was reached within 1–2 months, when the benefits of HA 
started to be manifest.
HA administration also influenced patients’ quality of 
life. Under baseline conditions, the EQ-5D values were 
similar in the two groups, and close to a report in Italian 
patients with cirrhosis.32 During the follow-up, a lower 
decay of both utility index and VAS score was seen in the 
SMT plus HA than the SMT group. The resulting 
differences reached significance from the 3rd to the 
12th month, a relevant result in such severely ill patients.
Long-term HA administration is deemed to be an 
expensive treatment, and an attempt to determine the cost-
effectiveness of this intervention is warranted. Hospital 
admissions represent a major health-care cost in patients 
with decompensated cirrhosis.6 Thus, an important result 
of our study is that HA treatment was associated with a 
significant reduction in the number of hospital admissions 
and total days spent in the hospital. These findings, 
combined with fewer paracenteses, lower expenditure to 
treat complications, and reduced HA use for evidence-
based indications, are likely to balance the costs of long-
term HA administration. In Italy, cost drivers are based on 
National Health Service reimbursement rates and are 
much lower than in other high-income countries. Despite 
this, the ICER:QALY ratio calculated in this study was 
below the threshold adopted by NICE to consider a 
treatment cost-effective.25 Furthermore, the bootstrap 
analysis further supported this finding, providing even 
more favourable results.
Long-term HA administration was generally very well 
tolerated as only three mild allergic reactions and two 
severe side-effects—represented by sepsis—occurred, 
leading to treatment interruption in three cases. HA 
batches analysis in the cases of sepsis did not reveal 
contamination, suggesting that these side-effects were 
due to venepuncture. Moreover, a concomitant previously 
unrecognised pneumonia in one patient casts doubts on 
the role of HA administration in that case.
The main limitation of this study is that it is an open-
label trial. Weekly HA administration led patients to be 
seen, usually by nurses, more frequently than those 
enrolled in the SMT group. Thus, impending compli-
cations could have been treated more promptly. However, 
closer patient surveillance might have disclosed a higher 
number of events, thereby increasing the incidence of 
complications in the SMT plus HA group. In any case, 
such a difference reflects what would happen in real-world 
clinical practice, a feature of pragmatic trials.33 Although 
pragmatic trials might have a reduced internal validity 
because of the absence of blinding, they are likely to have 
a better external validity provided they are founded on 
large sample-size, prolonged follow-up, and hard primary 
endpoints. All these features were observed in the present 
study, involving centres with diverse clinical settings. 
Notably, no significant centre effect was seen on primary 
outcome. Furthermore, besides the ethical concern related 
to the weekly patient attendance to hospital services to 
receive placebo infusion, the choice of the fluid to be 
used in patients with decompensated cirrhosis can be 
problematic. Indeed, any potential alternative presents 
shortcomings: sodium-containing solutions would en-
hance sodium overload, glucose solution is unsuitable in 
diabetics and might favour hyponatraemia, and synthetic 
colloids are potentially associated with side-effects such as 
anaphylaxis, coagulo 
pathy, or renal failure.34–36 Lastly, 
outcome assessors and analysts were also not blinded. 
However, the outcome analysts belong to an independent 
non-profit consortium (CINECA, Bologna, Italy) and did 
the entire statistical assessment once the database had 
been definitively frozen. This precaution would at least 
temper the risk of bias related to this type of unmasking.
A second limitation stems from the ethical need to 
interrupt the study when patients needed three or more 
paracenteses per month (appendix). This shortened the 
follow-up duration especially in the SMT group. However, 
censoring patients in a very advanced disease stage, when 
event incidence is likely to be higher, might have lessened 
rather than magnified the differences between the 
two groups. Finally, weekly intravenous infusions require 
frequent use of health-care services. However, the entire 
procedure can be done in less than 1 h in an outpatient 
setting or even at home, if domiciliary care is available. 
Even though the weekly schedule entails careful patient 
compliance, this study shows that most patients were 
strongly committed to follow a demanding treatment 
if they perceived a health benefit from therapy. We 
believe that the clinical advantages, including the lives 
saved and fewer admissions to hospital, justify the HA 
care management.
Another limitation regards the cost-effectiveness analysis 
as non-health care or indirect costs were not accounted for 
in our study. However, our cost analysis followed a third-
party payer perspective that pro 
vides reimbursement of 
the Diagnosis Related Group and ambulatory tariffs, which 
include the cost of personnel but not indirect costs.
In conclusion, long-term weekly HA administration in 
patients with decompensated cirrhosis acts as a cost-
effective disease-modifying treatment since it not only 
provides a better control of ascites but also reduces the 
incidence of complications and related hospital ad-
missions, and improves survival and quality of life. The 
identification of patient subgroups who would benefit 
most from long-term HA administration merits additional 
investigation. These results might prompt a change in HA 
use in decompensated cirrhosis from targeting specific 
complications to a more comprehensive approach aimed 
at slowing down the progression of the disease.
