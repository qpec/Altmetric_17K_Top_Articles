Abstract
Background
Violence against women by an intimate partner (DV) is a serious public health and human
rights issue. Attitudes justifying DV strongly predict its perpetration and victimisation. This
paper presents gendered ecological analyses of the societal acceptance of DV in 49 low-
and middle-income countries (LMICs) across geographical regions.
Methods and findings
We utilised data from 49 Demographic and Health Surveys conducted between 2005 and
2017, United Nations Statistics and topic-specific meta-databases. DV acceptance was
measured as the justification of ‘wife-beating’ in at least one of five circumstances, and by
the summative scale. Stepwise multiple linear regression examined country-level social,
economic and political empowerment predictors of societal acceptance of DV amongst
women, men, and the aggregate gender difference. Women were more likely than men to
justify DV in Sub-Saharan Africa and South (east) Asia with societal acceptance of DV being
more widespread in these regions compared with Latin America, the Caribbean, Central/
West Asia and Europe. Political conflict and limited economic rights for women were associ-
ated with higher levels of DV acceptance amongst women and men. Men in more demo-
cratic countries were less likely to justify DV. Amongst women, higher national female
literacy rates predicted lower levels of justification. There were higher levels of DV accep-
tance amongst women and a wider aggregate gender difference in countries with a larger
representation of women in national parliament.
Conclusion
Justification of DV is widespread amongst women and men in LMICs with acceptance rates
varying across countries and regions. Gender differences in the impact of contextual factors
on DV acceptance supports a gendered approach to national-level interventions. Our find-
ings highlight the need for tailored interventions targeting DV acceptance in conflict-

criminatory gender norms.
Introduction
Societal attitudes to domestic violence against women by an intimate partner (DV) play a key
role in the perpetration of DV, women’s responses to their victimisation, disclosure and help-
seeking behaviour, and the wider community’s and society’s responses to DV [1]. Over 35 pop-
ulation-based studies from Asia, Africa and the Middle East have demonstrated that attitudes
condoning DV and discriminatory gender norms around male authority and control are
highly predictive of rates of perpetration and victimisation (for example [1–13]). Given that
one in three women globally have experienced physical/sexual violence from an intimate part-
ner at least once in their lifetime [14, 15], DV is the most common form of violence against
women. It is a human rights violation and has been recognised as a public health issue of epi-
demic proportions with negative short- and long-term impacts on women’s and children’s
physical and psychological health and well-being. It has socio-economic consequences for
families, and more widely impacts on the social and economic development of countries [16].
Primary prevention of DV is both urgent and vital, however, much remains to be accom-
plished in the evidence-based prevention, not least in better understanding societal attitudes
to DV that have been identified as a central part of the “social ecology” of violence against
women [17].
There is a growing body of research, including some multi-country studies, on the structure
of attitudes to DV at the individual or household level in low-and middle-income countries
[2–12, 18–21]. However, there is little cross-national country-level evidence [22, 23] on how
social, economic and political empowerment strategies, accepted as indicators of gender (in)
equality influence the societal acceptability of DV. At the macro-level, Heise’s social ecological
framework references gender norms including the acceptance of DV, systems that privilege
men’s entitlement, rigid gender roles, masculinities linked to aggression and dominance, and
honour as important drivers of violence against women [17, 24, 25]. A fundamental premise
of this study is that DV is a manifestation of unequal power between men and women. The
acceptance of unequal gender roles and justification of DV in a society is seen as indicative of
the status of women. Hence the theory that policies and programmes to improve the status of
women and facilitate their participation at all levels of development will reduce DV is reason-
able and compelling. However, to date, there is limited empirical data to support it [17, 26–
27].
Discriminatory formal and informal social institutions [28–30] including gender norms
and the acceptance of DV are deeply rooted in and cannot be separated from their geographi-
cal, socio-cultural, economic and political settings. Building on a nascent evidence-base, this
multi-country study addresses an important knowledge gap on how different systemic eco-
nomic, social and political empowerment factors including those related to wider gender
inequalities such as national female literacy rates, multidimensional poverty, women’s labour
force participation, women’s participation in public life, the existence and quality of laws on
DV, political conflict and levels of democracy influence societal attitudes towards DV amongst
women and men across national and geographic settings.

 Furthermore, examining the gendered pattern in societal attitudes towards DV and the gen-
der differences in the contextual drivers of these attitudes is an important step towards imple-
menting appropriate gender-sensitive national- and international-level DV prevention policies
and intervention programmes. However, few population-based multi-country studies have
adopted gender-centric analyses of men’s and women’s attitudes to DV in low- and middle-
income settings [18–21, 23].
In this paper we examine the prevalence and pattern of attitudes towards DV amongst
women and men across 49 low- and middle-income countries, the country-level economic,
social and political predictors of its societal acceptance and how the impact of these factors on
attitudes may differ for women and men.
Methods
Data and sample
This paper draws on several sources of data including 49 Demographic and Health Surveys
(DHS) conducted between 2006 and 2017 and available as of February 2017. The DHS (some-
times referred to as the National Family Health Survey or the Maternal and Child Welfare
Surveys, for example, in different countries) are nationally representative, cross-sectional,
household sample surveys with large sample sizes and robust multi-stage cluster sampling
techniques. As a gendered analysis was central to this study only the 49 low- and middle-
income countries with comparable DHS data on women’s and men’s attitudes to DV and mea-
sures of women’s empowerment are included in our sample. The most recent survey per coun-
try was used. The 49 country surveys represent 1,174,108 respondents that included women
aged 15–49 years and men aged 15–59 years. (S1A Table). The survey year matched prevalence
rates of DV experienced by women in the sampled countries are also presented in the Appen-
dices (See S1B Table).
Country-level metadata were accessed from different UN Statistics, multilateral and topic
specific databases to construct a pooled database. All data were harmonised prior to analyses.
Ethical considerations
The DHS has especially trained interviewers to administer the survey. Consent was obtained
from all respondents. The interviews were conducted to maximise privacy and safety. All iden-
tifier information is removed. The surveys were approved by the Ethics Committee of the ICF
International and by the National Ethics Committee in each of the countries. (See https://
dhsprogram.com/What-We-Do/Protecting-the-Privacy-of-DHS-Survey-Respondents.cfm for
details). This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the University of Bristol.
Outcome variable
The DHS measured attitudes towards DV using 5 items. Respondents were asked if a husband
is justified in hitting or beating his wife if: “she burns the food,” “she argues with the husband,”
“she goes out without informing the husband,” “she neglects the children,” and “she refuses to
have sex with the husband". Response options were ‘Yes’, ‘No’ and ‘Don’t know’. Four sets of
country-level outcome variables were created by aggregating the individual-level data as fol-
lows: two binary outcome variables for women’s and men’s acceptance rates of wife-beating
coded as ’0’ if the response to any one of the five scenarios was ‘no’ and ‘1’ if they responded
‘yes’. When aggregated across individuals, attitudinal measures can serve as a reasonable proxy
for norms that prevail in a setting and measure the prevalence rate of societal acceptance of
DV (13). Using the first set of country-level outcome variables the survey-level variable of the

 ‘gender difference in acceptance of DV’ was computed (difference in the proportion of women
justifying DV and men justifying DV in at least one situation). An ‘Attitudes to DV’ additive
scale ranging from 0 to 5 was constructed after conducting reliability analyses per country and
of the pooled data (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.86). This is a country-level mean score where higher
values on the scale reflect higher levels of justification of DV and vice versa.
Explanatory variables
The country-level social, economic and political empowerment measures and data sources are
thematically summarised in S2 Table. For each of the country-level predictors, data matching
the DHS survey year was used, and where this was unavailable, data for the closest year preced-
ing the survey date was used. This global scale study examines a comprehensive range of risk
and protective factors associated with the acceptance of DV rather than, for example, the use
of less nuanced composite indices like the Human Development Index or the Gender Inequal-
ity Index. A robust household-level multidimensional deprivation index was constructed in
line with the Sustainable Development Goals using the DHS data on housing materials, access
to basic healthcare, sanitation, safe drinking water and primary education. A mean country
score was computed, i.e. the higher the value the more severe the material deprivation. This
index has advantages over the DHS Wealth Index which is a relative index constructed for
each country at the time of the survey and is useful for studying within country equity and rel-
ative economic poverty. With each having a mean value of zero and a standard deviation of
one specific scores cannot be directly compared across countries or over time.
Statistical analyses
Prevalence estimates of societal acceptance of DV are presented as country-level percentages
of women’s and men’s justification of DV in at least one circumstance. Spearman’s rank corre-
lation examined the unadjusted relationship between the contextual-level factors and societal
levels of DV acceptance. Multivariate analyses using stepwise linear regression models identi-
fied the independent influence of significant economic, social, and political indicators of wom-
en’s and men’s acceptance of DV at the country-level. Data were screened for multivariate
outliers and none of the cases had an undue influence on the model (Cook’s distance<1). The
scatterplot and histogram of the distribution of residuals along with the normal probability
plot confirmed that model assumptions (normality and homoscedasticity of residuals) had
been met. Collinearity diagnostics indicated no evidence of multicollinearity. A total of 18
models were estimated where all outcome variables (but the gender gap) are skewed and zero-
bounded (censored). Tobit and linear regression models were fitted to assess the effect of trun-
cation upon the estimates. Both model strategies yielded the same results and therefore only
the coefficients from the linear regression models are presented. Stata v14 was used to conduct
all analyses.
Results
Prevalence and distribution of women’s and men’s acceptance of DV
The prevalence of DV-supportive attitudes ranked within- and between-regions is presented
in Table 1. Societal acceptance of DV was lowest in the Dominican Republic (3.13%) and was
most widespread in Timor-Leste (83.47%). Over one in three people (36.40%) across these 49
countries justified DV in at least one circumstance. Regional averages suggest that women
and men in Latin America and the Caribbean (11.87%), and Central/West Asia and Europe
(28.55%) have less widespread violence-justifying attitudes compared to their counter-parts in

 Sub-Saharan Africa (38.40%) and South/South-East Asia (46.78%). There is, nonetheless, a
large degree of variation across countries and within global regions with especially high rates
of DV acceptance in conflict-affected countries. For example, within Sub-Saharan Africa
whilst 12.58% of the population in Malawi justified DV, its acceptance in the Democratic
Republic of Congo was close to 70% and 79.12% in Guinea. Similarly, in the South and South
-East Asia region Maldives had the lowest prevalence rates of DV-justifying attitudes at 13.79%
but within the same region Timor-Leste and Afghanistan (76%) had the highest prevalence of
pro-DV attitudes amongst the 49 sampled countries.
The five attitudinal items were combined additively to construct the ‘Attitudes to DV’ scale
ranging from 0–5. The last three columns in Table 1 suggest a strong positive association
between the severity of the justification of DV (as measured by the mean scores) and the preva-
lence of DV-supportive attitudes: countries and geographical regions where women and men
have a higher mean score on the justification of DV scale were also the countries and regions
with more widespread societal acceptance of DV. For example, in the Dominican Republic
with the lowest prevalence of societal acceptance of DV also had the lowest mean score
(M = 0.06) compared with Timor-Leste (M = 2.65) or Guniea (M = 2.76) where the prevalence
of violence-justifying attitudes was very high. The levels of DV justification was highest in
South (east) Asia (M = 1.25) and Sub-Saharan Africa (M = 1.02) as compared to Latin America
and the Caribbean (M = 0.23) and Central/West Asia and Europe (M = 0.65).
Fig 1 visually presents the gender disaggregated population prevalence of DV justification
across the 49 countries. Each data point represents the proportion of women and men justify-
ing DV in at least one of the presented circumstances with the 45 degrees line representing the
line of equality between men’s and women’s attitudes. A larger proportion of women justified
DV in a majority of countries (36 of the 49) including all the South (east) Asian countries, and
in 33 of the 37 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa with the exceptions of Kenya, Lesotho, Swazi-
land and Malawi. On the other hand, in most of the countries in Central West Asia and Europe
in Latin America and the Caribbean a larger proportion of men justified DV. Across the 49
countries 41% of women and 32% of men justified DV.

 and the pooled result. The calculated pooled effect estimate assuming a fixed-effects model
was OR = 1.39; 95% CI 1.37–1.41. The Cochran’s Q test (Q = 4299.34; p < .001) and the corre-
sponding I2 (99%) indicated statistically significant heterogeneity. In the leave-one-country-
out sensitivity analysis the CIs did not change materially with exclusion of any of the countries,
which remains within 95% confidence interval of the overall estimate for all countries. This
analysis confirmed the stability of the results.
Fig 2 suggests that most countries with high levels of DV justification also had substantially
wider gaps in women’s and men’s acceptance of DV. Furthermore, in these countries with
higher societal acceptance of DV, women were more likely to justify DV compared with men.
For example, the largest gender differences were in Guinea, with women being almost 6 times
more likely than men to justify DV (OR = 5.93; CI 4.67, 7.53). In Niger (OR = 4.30; CI 3.62,

counterparts to justify DV. However, Fig 2 also indicates that even in some countries with
lower prevalence of societal acceptance of DV there were substantive gender gaps such as in
Ukraine where men were over three times more likely to justify DV than women (OR = .30; CI

Contextual-level determinants of societal attitudes to domestic violence
Results from bivariate analyses.
Bivariate analyses indicate that amongst the social and
economic correlates lower levels of multi-dimensional deprivation, higher national female lit-
eracy rates and greater economic rights for women were associated with lower levels of societal
acceptance of DV amongst women and men (Table 2). National rates of female secondary and
tertiary education, and prevalence of early marriage in a country were significantly correlated
with lower acceptance of DV only amongst women.

 Higher levels of democracy and lower levels of political conflict were significantly correlated
with lower levels of DV acceptance at the national level. The existence of an explicit law against
DV and the quality of the law, however, were not significantly associated with national levels
of DV acceptance.
Levels of female education, poverty, prevalence of early marriage and women’s economic
rights were correlated with the gender gap in the societal acceptance of DV (Table 2). Among
the political and legislative factors, only conflict within the past 5 years was significantly associ-
ated with the gender difference in attitudes to DV.
Results from multivariate analysis.
Table 3 presents the results of the linear regression
analyses of the country-level economic, social and political predictors of women’s and men’s
acceptance of DV (at the aggregate level). The regression models first examined the economic
and social predictors of women’s and men’s attitudes to DV and then, separately, the political
factors (S3A–S3D Table) before constructing the combined model.
Multivariate predictors of women’s and men’s acceptance domestic violence.
As indi-
cated by Table 3 greater women’s economic rights was a predictor of lower levels of DV accep-
tance by both women and men at the country level with a larger effect for women (B = -.335,
p < .05) than for men (B = -.173, p < .05). Whilst the societal acceptance of DV, especially
amongst women, was higher in poorer countries (B = .202, p < .05) this was no longer signifi-
cant once the country’s female literacy rate was introduced into the model. Higher levels of
female literacy was the strongest protective factor for women’s societal acceptance of DV
(B = 1.760, p < .001).

 Political conflict was a significant risk factor for higher levels of DV acceptance amongst
both women (B = .025, p < .05) and men (B = .078, p < .05). This effect of conflict on men’s
acceptance of DV was stronger than that for women. There was lower acceptance of DV
amongst men in more democratic nations (B = .298, p < .05). Contrary to expectations, a
greater representation of women in national parliament was associated with higher levels of
DV acceptance amongst women (B = .101, p < .05).
Multivariate predictors of the gender difference in acceptance of DV. Table 4 presents
the national social, economic and political predictors of the aggregate gender difference in the
acceptance of DV. As with the previous models, a country’s multidimensional deprivation
score significantly predicted the gender gap in DV attitudes (B = 5.735, p < .01) before
accounting for national female literacy rates. National female literacy rates emerged as the
strongest predictor of aggregate gender difference in DV acceptance (B = -.283, p < .01).
Women’s representation in national parliament and the existence of national legislation on
DV also significantly predicted larger gender gaps in the societal acceptance of DV.

 South-East Asia, Europe, Latin America and Sub-Saharan Africa. The prevalence rates of DV
justification varied widely across countries and geographical regions ranging from 3% in the
Dominican Republic to 81% in Timor-Leste. The acceptance of DV was more widespread in
Sub-Saharan Africa and South and South-East Asia compared with Latin America, the Carib-
bean, Central Asia and Europe.
The study found that women are more likely to justify DV than men in 36 of the 49 coun-
tries especially in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. This finding is in line with previous
studies that focussed on Sub-Saharan Africa [21] and South Asia [18]. The widespread justifi-
cation of DV by women in Africa and Asia, referred to by Caldwell as the ‘Patriarchal Belt’
[31] can be explained by Kandiyoti’s (1988) theory of ‘patriarchal bargaining’ [32]. According
to Kandiyoti many women who live under classic patriarchy are pressured or motivated to
conform to the norms of wife blaming in cases of violence as a strategy to mitigate DV [32–
34]. Women often internalise the idea that a husband who physically punishes or verbally
reprimands his wife has exercised a right that serves her interest. This ‘disciplining’ is seen as a
legitimate reprisal for a wife’s disobedience rather than as ‘violence’ [33, 34].
National female literacy rates, a component of a country’s multidimensional poverty index,
emerged as the most significant socio-economic protective factor for the acceptance of DV
amongst women at the societal level. Levels of justification of DV were lower amongst women
in societies with higher levels of female literacy. Female literacy, a measure of women’s
empowerment and gender equality status, did not, however, have a significant impact on
men’s levels of DV acceptance. This important finding makes a strong case for national poli-
cies aimed at improving the status of women and preventing DV to take into account gender
disparities in the influence of literacy and education on reducing the societal acceptability of
DV and discriminatory gender norms.
This association between poverty and literacy rates is re-iterated by our results that indicate
a significant association between a country’s multidimensional deprivation scores and wom-
en’s acceptance of DV until we account for national female literacy rates. Severe material,
health and education deprivation results in loss in “functioning or freedoms” [35] and along-
side rigid gender roles in highly traditional patriarchal societies suggests a strong association
between material deprivation and the justification of DV.
The societal acceptance of DV was lower in countries with more gender-equitable eco-
nomic rights for women that includes, for example, the right to free choice of profession or
employment without the need to obtain a husband or male relative’s consent and; the right to
gainful employment without the need to obtain a husband or male relative’s consent. These
findings suggest that expanding women’s economic rights can serve to challenge existing social
norms around gender roles and expectations of women and men. They play an important
role in contesting the justification of DV towards a woman who is perceived as transgressing
boundaries of wife and/or mother strictly defined for her by her husband and/or male relative
and wider society. These rights can thus foster greater agency and transform choices and
endowments to achieve desired outcomes [36].
The societal acceptance of DV amongst men was lower in countries with more democratic
regimes. Levels of democracy are related to the extent of political participation, the likelihood
of a country’s ratification of international treaties and conventions including CEDAW and of
having DV legislation [37]. Government structures make laws easier or more difficult to imple-
ment. While the existence and quality of DV legislation was associated with lower levels of
societal acceptance of DV, this association was not statistically significant. As this is an ecologi-
cal analysis with a sample size of 49 countries, a focus on statistically significant p values limits
our ability to detect very weak effects or draw generalizable conclusions. The existence of an
explicit national DV law was, however, associated with a wider gender gap in DV attitudes.

 Putting laws against DV in place is an important first step for several reasons including defin-
ing the different forms of violence against women and signalling government commitment to
tackling DV. Policies and laws may result from social movements that, in themselves, may
influence societal attitudes. Thus, the temporality and nature of the relationship between
enacting laws within the context of government structures and their influence on the societal
acceptability of DV is a complex one [38]. Importantly this relationship between the accept-
ability of DV and DV laws may be impacted on by the quality and comprehensiveness of that
legislation with regards to how DV is defined, (in)effective implementation, penalties, evidence
required and availability of support services for women. Whilst this is the first analysis to
account for the quality of the DV law in addition to just its existence, some of the issues around
the implementation of national legislation, change in the levels of societal acceptance of DV
over time, and their influence on attitudes at the individual- and neighbourhood-level warrant
further investigation. These issues are the focus of our forthcoming multilevel analyses papers.
Political conflict significantly increased the likelihood of higher societal acceptance of DV
amongst both women and men. The threat women face from sexual violence in conflict areas
is increasingly well-documented [39–41]. However, DV, an already acute and pervasive prob-
lem, exacerbated during and after armed conflict, has received less attention [42–46]. The
tension between ‘traditional’ and ‘modern’ gender roles may be particularly heightened in con-
flict areas where gender norm shifts are precipitated by financial strains and unemployment
resulting from economic downturns [47]–an increased status for women taking on the role
of primary earner and men’s perceptions of loss of power and authority [47–48]. Financial
dependence, which is more marked in times of conflict, may lead to greater acceptance of DV
[49], and wider conflict in the community and society may normalise violence within the
household [50]. The findings of the present study contribute to the evidence-base on the socie-
tal acceptance of DV in conflict-impacted countries. It emphasises the need to develop strate-
gies to prevent DV by addressing discriminatory gender norms through targeted initiatives in
societies affected by political conflict. Our study also highlights the need for more research
into understanding the acceptance of DV in conflict-affected societies and the risk and protec-
tive factors associated with these DV-justifying attitudes within these regions.
The levels of societal acceptance of DV amongst women was higher in countries with a
larger number of women representatives in national parliament. There could be several rea-
sons for these findings being opposite to the hypothesised direction: In countries with high
gender inequality, governments may be encouraged, through (inter)national pressure, to
ensure greater political participation of women through quota systems for example; elected
officials, including women, may reinforce existing social norms including the justification of
DV especially in societies where its acceptance is widespread; women’s representation at the
national level may also be a crude measure that does not accurately reflect participation and
agency at the subnational levels where progress has been slower. The ability of elected officials
to influence policies also largely depends on the overall strength of the institutions and com-
mittees within which they work. Legislation and administrative procedures that are not
women-friendly will limit the impact of female board members [51]. Finally, large and sudden
gains in political representation for women are likely to take place when political systems expe-
rience broader shifts—after a conflict or political rupture for example [52–53]. This may result
in a rapid increase of women entering the political process. For example, Rwanda’s parliament
had 56% of women in 2016 compared with just 17% in 1995 [54].
This study suggests that whilst there were some similarities in the drivers of women’s and
men’s attitudes towards DV at the aggregate level (women’s economic rights and political con-
flict), they also differed by gender. Economic factors, poverty and education in particular had a
greater influence on the societal acceptance of DV amongst women whilst political and

 government structures influenced men’s justification of DV. The gender gap in the societal
acceptance of DV was significantly predicted by country-level multidimensional poverty,
female literacy rates, explicit national legislation on DV and the proportion of seats held by
women in national parliament.
Added value of this study and limitations
There are several noteworthy contributions of this research. This 49-country study is the one
of the first to conduct a gendered analysis of the societal acceptance of DV across geographical
regions. The number and breadth of countries included in the study gives a more global per-
spective on violence-justifying attitudes amongst peoples in the global south. It goes beyond
existing evidence from multi-country studies that have examined DV attitudes within specific
geographical regions, mainly Sub-Saharan Africa [19–21, 24], South Asia [18] and Europe
[55], and have largely focussed on individual-level attitudes.
The ecological analyses highlighted the similarities and differences in the prevalence as well
as levels and ‘severity’ of DV justification amongst women and men. This study drew on a
comprehensive range of diverse high quality internationally comparable metadata to identify
the contextual influence of social, economic and political structures on the societal acceptance
of DV.
Every effort was made to assess the robustness of the metadata before deciding on the data
source for specific country-level predictors. Nonetheless we were constrained by the reliability
of existing metadata, some of which relied on national government sources. We addressed this
challenge by triangulating data sources and conducting a rigorous scrutiny of coding proce-
dures, decision trees and technical papers preceding decisions to use (sub)-indices. In cases
metadata with non-survey year matched data we prioritised metadata preceding the survey
year. As changes in contextual factors are slow over time any threat to the validity of the find-
ings was minimised [13].
Given that the aim of this paper was to provide an understanding of the contextual predic-
tors of the societal acceptance of DV, we do not present the multilevel analyses of the indepen-
dent influence of individual- and contextual-level factors on DV attitudes. We present these
hierarchical models in our forthcoming papers. Given the use of cross-sectional data and
macro-level analyses we do not make any claims to causation or temporal associations between
the predictors and attitudes to DV.
Despite these limitations this study has significant strengths, and provides robust and
much-needed evidence on a global scale of the country-level predictors associated with atti-
tudes towards DV. These findings could inform the development of effective prevention inter-
vention programmes and policies on what works at the national level, considering that the
economic, social and political interventions would impact on women’s and men’s social
norms differently.
Conclusion
Our study highlighted the widespread acceptance of DV amongst both women and men in
low- and middle-income countries with the prevalence and distribution varying widely across
countries and geographical regions. In majority of countries in Sub-Saharan Africa and South
(east) Asia women were more likely to justify DV whereas this gender difference was reversed
in Central/West Asia and Europe. National strategies and public policies aimed at preventing
DV and tackling wider gender inequalities might thus need to adopt a geographically differen-
tiated approach to optimally target the societal acceptance of DV.

 The evidenced role of structural socio-economic and political empowerment factors on the
justification of DV could encourage national governments’, international organisations’ and
donors’ to prioritise a multifaceted approach to DV prevention. The study’s findings on the
strong impact of political conflict on the societal acceptance of DV suggests the need for the
development of prevention interventions tailored to tackling the societal acceptance of DV in
these conflict-impacted countries.
Commonly-used dimensions in gender (in)equality indices including women’s labour
force participation, number of seats held by women in national parliament and female educa-
tional attainment (primary, secondary and tertiary) were not associated with a reduction in
societal acceptance of DV. These findings indicate that international DV prevention policies in
LMICs need to consider that a sole focus on narrowly defined ‘empowerment’ indicators are
insufficient in themselves in influencing and challenging existing discriminatory gender
norms.
Finally, our findings also suggest that systemic factors influence women’s and men’s atti-
tudes towards DV differently. This suggests that public health and national DV prevention pol-
icies could potentially benefit from a gendered approach to effectively tackle harmful social
norms in the global south.
