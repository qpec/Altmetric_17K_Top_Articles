The spinal cord consists of multiple neuronal cell types that are
critical to motor control and arise from distinct progenitor domains
in the developing neural tube. Excitatory V2a interneurons in
particular are an integral component of central pattern generators
that control respiration and locomotion; however, the lack of a
robust source of human V2a interneurons limits the ability to
molecularly profile these cells and examine their therapeutic
potential to treat spinal cord injury (SCI). Here, we report the
directed differentiation of CHX10+ V2a interneurons from human
pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs). Signaling pathways (retinoic acid,
sonic hedgehog, and Notch) that pattern the neural tube were
sequentially perturbed to identify an optimized combination of
small molecules that yielded ∼25% CHX10+ cells in four hPSC lines.
Differentiated cultures expressed much higher levels of V2a phe-
notypic markers (CHX10 and SOX14) than other neural lineage
markers. Over time, CHX10+ cells expressed neuronal markers [neu-
rofilament, NeuN, and vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (VGlut2)],
and cultures exhibited increased action potential frequency. Single-
cell RNAseq analysis confirmed CHX10+ cells within the differenti-
ated population, which consisted primarily of neurons with some
glial and neural progenitor cells. At 2 wk after transplantation into
the spinal cord of mice, hPSC-derived V2a cultures survived at
the site of injection, coexpressed NeuN and VGlut2, extended
neurites >5 mm, and formed putative synapses with host neurons.
These results provide a description of V2a interneurons differenti-
ated from hPSCs that may be used to model central nervous system
development and serve as a potential cell therapy for SCI.

ell replacement is a promising therapeutic strategy to restore
motor function and sensation after traumatic injury to the
central nervous system (CNS). Several clinical trials are currently
investigating the therapeutic efficacy of various transplanted neural
cells to treat spinal cord injury (SCI), including oligodendrocyte
progenitors derived from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) (1),
autologous Schwann cells (2), and fetal-derived neural stem cells
(3) and precursor cells (4, 5). Despite such efforts, however, the
ability of specific neuronal cell types to functionally restore dam-
aged neural networks needs further investigation.
Pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) provide a renewable source of
cells that can differentiate into a variety of neurons, provided
that the necessary signaling cues are presented in an appropriate
spatiotemporal manner. Different types of neurons, including
forebrain and midbrain neural cell types, such as cortical neurons
(6), dopaminergic neurons (7), and inhibitory interneurons from
the medial ganglionic eminence (8, 9), have been differentiated
from hPSCs, but motor neurons are the only caudal neuronal
population to be generated from hPSCs to date (10, 11).
V2a spinal interneurons in particular are crucial to the
transmission and coordination of motor and sensory functions
(12, 13). Glutamatergic V2a interneurons, identified by expression
of the CHX10 transcription factor (14), are distributed throughout
the hindbrain and spinal cord in mammals and relay excitatory
stimuli to central pattern generators that regulate motor function
for breathing and locomotion (15–19). Ablation of V2a inter-
neurons in mice results in disruption of normal breathing patterns
(18), impaired forelimb reaching tasks (15), and loss of left-right
hindlimb coordination (16, 17).
Combinations of various morphogenic signals are responsible
for patterning of the neural tube during development. The
rostral-caudal location of spinal cell types is patterned by retinoic
acid (RA) released from adjacent somites (20). In parallel, an
orthogonal ventral-dorsal gradient of sonic hedgehog (Shh), se-
creted from the floor plate and notochord, specifies independent
progenitor domains (21) that yield mature cell types with distinct
roles in motor function. In the ventral neural tube, excitatory
V2a and inhibitory V2b interneurons arise coincidentally from
the p2 domain (22, 23), which is located immediately dorsal to
the pMN domain. Notch signaling dictates the balance between
V2a and V2b interneurons, with Notch signaling necessary for
the specification of V2b interneurons and Notch inhibition in-
creasing the proportion of V2a interneurons (Fig. 1A) (24).
This study provides a description of human V2a interneurons
differentiated from PSCs with small molecule agonists and an-
tagonists of developmental signaling pathways. We investigated
Significance
Spinal cord injury (SCI) significantly disrupts normal neural
circuitry, leading to severe degradation of motor and sensory
function. Excitatory interneurons that relay signals from the
brain to neural networks throughout the spinal cord, including
glutamatergic V2a interneurons that coordinate respiration
and locomotion, are lost after SCI. Thus, transplantation of V2a
interneurons after SCI could provide a novel therapy to restore
functional connections between the brain and spared down-
stream neurons. This study describes the generation of V2a inter-
neurons from human pluripotent stem cells, using developmentally
relevant morphogenic signaling pathways. This work provides
initial insight into the development of excitatory human inter-
neurons and enables the examination of their therapeutic efficacy
for SCI repair.

 the specificity of the defined protocol and the ability of the dif-
ferentiated cells to mature into excitatory neurons in vitro and
in vivo. These results provide a robust source of human V2a in-

examine their therapeutic potential for repair of spinal cord injury.
Results
hPSC-Derived V2a Interneuron Differentiation Depends on RA, Shh,
and Inhibition of Notch Signaling. Motor neurons, which arise
ventral to V2a interneurons, have been differentiated from hPSCs in
∼3 wk with dual SMAD inhibition, followed by RA and Shh agonists
(11). Thus, using a similar time course, the concentrations of known
morphogens and signaling pathways that specify V2a commitment
[RA, Shh, and the Notch inhibitor N-[(3,5-difluorophenyl)acetyl]-
L-alanyl-2-phenyl]glycine-1,1-dimethylethyl ester (DAPT)] in mouse
embryonic stem cells (ESCs) (25, 26) were sequentially varied in-
dependently, and the percentages of CHX10+ cells differentiated
from hPSCs at day 17 were examined. An RA concentration of
100 nM starting at day 5 of culture with fixed concentrations of the
Shh agonist purmorphamine (pur; 1 μM) and DAPT (5 μM) (both
beginning on day 7) resulted in the greatest CHX10+ population at
day 17 (∼6%; Fig. 1C). Following that, treatment with 100 nM pur
beginning at day 7 with 100 nM RA and 5 μM DAPT resulted in
∼30% CHX10+ cells after 17 d of differentiation (Fig. 1D). Finally,
the concentration of DAPT was varied beginning on day 7 with
fixed RA and pur concentrations (100 nM each), and 1 μM and
5 μM DAPT resulted in comparable CHX10+ populations
(∼20%; Fig. 1E). Regardless of morphogen concentration,
CHX10+ cells appeared to be evenly distributed throughout the
differentiating cultures (Fig. 1 F–H).
Because DAPT concentrations of 1 μM and 5 μM yielded
similar efficiencies of V2a interneuron differentiation, we ex-
amined the effects of these concentrations on the efficiency of
CHX10+ differentiation. Given that higher concentrations of
small molecule inhibitors, such as DAPT, are often more cytotoxic
(27), we examined the total number of cells and yield of CHX10+
cells per input number of PSCs. A lower DAPT concentration
(1 μM) yielded more viable cells than cultures treated with 5 μM
DAPT (4.40 million cells vs. 2.85 million cells per well of a 24-
well plate; SI Appendix, Fig. S1B), resulting in a ∼50% increase
in the number of CHX10+ cells per input PSC (SI Appendix, Fig.
S1C). Varying the onset of Notch inhibition by initiating DAPT
treatment on day 5, 7, or 10 of differentiation (SI Appendix, Fig.
S1D) yielded similar percentages of CHX10+ cells; thus, DAPT
was added at day 7 for all subsequent studies to coincide with the
introduction of pur. In addition, a seeding density of 25,000 cells
per cm2 resulted in a greater percentage of CHX10+ cells com-
pared with a density of 5,000 or 100,000 cells per cm2 (SI Ap-
pendix, Fig. S1E). Overall, these results demonstrate the ability
of hPSCs to robustly differentiate into putative V2a interneurons
by RA and Shh agonists in combination with Notch inhibition.
Differentiation of V2a Interneurons from hPSCs Is Specifically
Enriched. We analyzed gene expression throughout the first
17 d of differentiation to characterize the temporal changes in the
V2a interneuron cell population (Fig. 2A). As expected, expression
of the pluripotency gene POU5F1 (all gene descriptions in SI
Appendix, Table S2) decreased by day 3 and remained significantly
down-regulated through day 17. Early markers expressed during
neural tube development (PAX6 and NES) increased by day 7.
Other markers of spinal cell types expressed in the ventral neural
tube (GATA3, OLIG2, HB9, and SIM1) were detected as early as
day 3 and continued to increase throughout differentiation. Ex-
pression of markers for the p2 domain (FOXN4) and committed
V2a interneurons (CHX10 and SOX14) began on day 10 and were
highly up-regulated by day 15. Expression of neuronal genes
(TUBB3 and NEFL) was significantly up-regulated (∼10- and ∼70-
fold, respectively) at day 17, whereas expression of glial (PDGFRA,
CSPG4, SOX10, and GFAP) and retinal (THY1, IRBP, and CRX)
genes was not (Fig. 2B). Taken together, these results demonstrate

 that the observed gene expression profile of the population is
consistent with the expected phenotype of V2a interneurons.
To determine the reproducibility of V2a interneuron differ-
entiation, we tested the resulting protocol (i.e., 100 nM RA,
100 nM pur, and 1 μM DAPT) on several additional hPSC lines
(H1 ESCs, WTC iPSCs, and WTB iPSCs). We obtained robust
CHX10+ populations in all of the lines examined, with efficien-
cies ranging from ∼25% to 50% (Fig. 2C). Expression of spinal
neuronal markers was examined at day 17 for each of the hPSC
cell lines, and CHX10 levels were consistently high, whereas
markers for early neural tube development (PAX6) and other
neuronal subtypes (HB9 and GATA3) were low (Fig. 2D). No
discernible spatial patterns were observed for CHX10+ cells in
any of the differentiating cultures (SI Appendix, Fig. S2A). Over
the course of more than a dozen independent differentiation
studies, CHX10+ percentages >20% were routinely achieved (SI
Appendix, Fig. S2B). These data demonstrate the establishment
of a robust neuronal differentiation process that reproducibly
yields enriched cultures of V2a interneurons from hPSCs.
The specificity of the V2a interneuron protocol was examined
by direct comparison with a common human motor neuron
protocol (11) (Fig. 3A). After 17 d of differentiation, the V2a
interneuron differentiation yielded ∼30% CHX10+ cells, whereas
the motor neuron differentiation yielded very few CHX10+ cells
(<1%; Fig. 3B). CHX10+ nuclei and βIII tubulin expression were
more abundant under the V2a interneuron differentiation pro-
tocol compared with the motor neuron conditions (Fig. 3C, i and
ii). In addition, more OLIG2+ (progenitor motor neuron marker)
nuclei were yielded by the motor neuron differentiation conditions
than by the V2a interneuron protocol (Fig. 3C, iii and iv). Al-
though the expression of neuronal genes (NEFL, TUBB3, and
PAX6) was slightly elevated with the V2a interneuron differenti-
ation, the V2a interneuron transcription factors (CHX10 and
SOX14) exhibited the greatest increase in expression (∼100-fold)
relative to motor neuron cultures. Expression of other lineage
markers (GATA3, FOXN4, OLIG2, and HB9) did not appear to
differ between the two differentiation processes, however (Fig.
3D). Collectively, these results demonstrate that the V2a differ-
entiation conditions specifically enrich for CHX10+ interneurons.
We performed single-cell RNAseq analysis to define the cel-
lular composition of the heterogeneous cultures. Seven distinct
clusters of cells (designated A–G) were identified by k-means
clustering using 12 principal components (Fig. 4A) with 77% of
CHX10+ cells contained within cluster B (Fig. 4B). The top
globally differentially expressed genes were used to distinguish
the general phenotypes of the seven clusters that defined the total
population (Fig. 4C and SI Appendix, Table S1). Gene ontology
(GO) analysis and individual inspection of the top differentially
expressed genes (SI Appendix, Figs. S3–S5) suggested that clusters A
and B were committed neurons [neuralfilament medium polypeptide
(NEFM) and NSG1], cluster C was glial cells (PLP1 and TTHY1),
clusters D and E were neuron progenitors (NEUROD1), cluster F
contained mitotically active neuronal cells (FOXN4, PTTG1, and
UBE2C), and cluster G consisted of mesenchymal/muscle cells
(TAGLN and COL1A1) (SI Appendix, Figs. S3–S5). Overall, the
single-cell RNAseq data indicated that the vast majority of the
culture was neuronal (∼85%) at different stages of commitment
(64% fully committed neurons, 15% neuronal progenitors, and 5%
mitotic neuronal progenitors). Nonneuronal cells constituted
the remaining fraction of differentiated cells (13% glial and 2%
mesenchymal/muscle; Fig. 4D). Clusters A and B were the most
closely related to one another (Fig. 4E), sharing many highly
expressed genes (GAP43 and NEFM) and GO terms (growth cone
and axon). Cluster B, containing the majority of the CHX10+ cells,
comprised cells expressing a number of genes consistent with an
excitatory V2a interneuron phenotype, such as SOX21, SHOX2,
LHX3, and ornithine aminotransferase (OAT), as well as HOX
genes consistent with a hindbrain/cervical identity [homeobox B5
(HOXB5)] (SI Appendix, Fig. S6). Both clusters D and E were
identified as early neurons (NEUROG1); however, cells in cluster
D exhibited a more committed neuron phenotype (RND2 and
IGDCC3) compared with cells in cluster E (UBE2S and MT2A) (SI
Appendix, Fig. S4). Furthermore, 80% of cells expressing the
p2 marker FOXN4 were contained within the mitotically active
cluster F (SI Appendix, Fig. S6). Taken together, these data suggest
that the V2a differentiation cultures (at day 17) yield primarily
postmitotic excitatory neurons (clusters A and B) that arise from a
pool of neuronal progenitors (clusters D and E) and mitotic cells
(cluster F) (Fig. 4F) and contain an enriched population of cells
expressing markers consistent with a V2a interneuron phenotype.
Long-Term Culture Increases the Maturation Profile of V2a Interneurons.
To examine the maturation of V2a interneurons, differentiated
cultures were dissociated after 17 d, replated, and analyzed
on days 20, 30, 40, 50, and 60 of culture (Fig. 5A). By day
20, CHX10+ cells expressed neuronal markers βIII tubulin and
neurofilament, and expression persisted throughout 60 d of
culture (SI Appendix, Figs. S7 B–K and S8 A and B). Some
neuronal nuclei (NeuN) colocalized with CHX10+ cells, and
NeuN expression continued through day 60 (SI Appendix, Fig.
S7 L–P). Vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (VGlut2), a marker
of glutamatergic neurons, was not detected early (day 20; SI
Appendix, Fig. S7Q), but was abundant in later-stage cultures
(day 60), indicating the adoption of a mature glutamatergic fate
(SI Appendix, Fig. S7Y). Although many CHX10+ nuclei were
readily apparent initially (day 20; SI Appendix, Fig. S7B), identi-
fication of CHX10+ cells declined over time owing to reduced
expression, as well as to an increase in the total number of cells in
the cultures (SI Appendix, Fig. S8 C and D). Overall, the temporal
phenotypic expression patterns support the progressive, albeit
limited, maturation in vitro of the V2a interneuron cultures.
Calcium imaging was used to detect spontaneous electrical
activity during extended culture as a functional indication of
neuronal maturation. At different time points, individual soma
of cells loaded with Fluo4 were visually identified (white arrows;

 SI Appendix, Fig. S9 A and B). The average change in calcium
transients was measured over time. Although calcium spikes
were not observed initially (day 20), they were seen more often in
older cultures (day 40), with increasing amplitude and frequency
(SI Appendix, Fig. S9C). Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings of
individual cells were used to assess electrophysiological properties
of the differentiation over time. Although the resting membrane
potential did not significantly change throughout the duration of
culture (∼−40 mV) (SI Appendix, Fig. S9D), the action potential
frequency of V2a cultures increased over time in response to
current stimulation (20 pA, 1.5 s; SI Appendix, Fig. S9E, ii).
Consistent with the observed phenotypic expression patterns, the
electrophysiological properties of the differentiated cells suggest
some maturation of V2a interneuron cultures over time.
Transplanted hPSC-Derived V2a Interneurons Survive and Mature in
the Adult Murine Spinal Cord. The physiological response of hPSC-
derived V2a interneurons within the environment of the spinal
cord was examined by transplanting differentiated cultures into
naïve spinal cords of C57/SCID mice. V2a interneuron cultures
(∼45% CHX10+ cells; SI Appendix, Fig. S10 A and B) were
transplanted at thoracic vertebral level 9 (T9), and spinal cords
were harvested 2 wk later for histological analysis (SI Appendix,
Fig. S10C). Transplanted cells were identified in sagittal sections
with antibodies for a human cytoplasmic protein (Stem121; Fig.
5A) and human nuclear antigen (HNA; Fig. 5B). HNA+ nuclei
remained predominantly at the transplantation site, with limited
migration along the rostral/caudal axis of the spinal cord.
Stem121+ cells were observed at the transplantation site (Fig.
5C), with processes extending over 5 mm in both rostral and
caudal directions (Fig. 5D).
To assess the phenotype of the transplanted cells, adult mu-
rine spinal cord was examined by histological staining with a
panel of different neuronal markers. Most of the HNA+ cells
coexpressed CHX10 (61.1% ± 10.8%), confirming the survival of
transplanted V2a interneurons for at least 2 wk (Fig. 5 E–G).
The vast majority of CHX10+ cells expressed NeuN (91.1% ±
4.6%; Fig. 5H, arrows and Inset), and many expressed VGlut2
(Fig. 5I, Inset), indicating maturation of V2a interneurons into a
glutamatergic phenotype within the spinal cord environment.
Occasional GABA+ cells were found in the vicinity of the trans-
plantation site, but, as expected, CHX10+/GABA+ cells were

 never detected (Fig. 5J and Inset). In addition, no OCT4+ cells or
signs of potential teratoma formation were observed in any of the
histological sections examined (SI Appendix, Fig. S11 A–D).
Transplanted hPSC-derived V2a interneurons projected to mul-
tiple locations in the murine spinal cord (SI Appendix, Fig. S12A).
Stem121+ processes projected within the white matter, and many
branched into the adjacent gray matter as well (SI Appendix, Fig.
S12A, i). Transplanted neurons also projected axons between dis-
tinct transplantation sites (SI Appendix, Fig. S12A, ii). Putative
synapse formations of the transplanted cell population with host
cells were observed adjacent to the transplantation sites (SI Ap-
pendix, Fig. S12A, iii). The postsynaptic marker HOMER was found
on host neurons (NeuN+) in direct proximity to abutting human cell
neurites (Stem121+), suggesting synapse formation of transplanted
cells with the host tissue (SI Appendix, Fig. S12 B–E). In addition,
human cell neurite endings expressing the presynaptic marker syn-
aptophysin were observed directly adjacent to host neurons (SI
Appendix, Fig. S12 F–I). Stem121+ cells also expressed the post-
synaptic marker GRIP1 (SI Appendix, Fig. S12 J–M). These results
demonstrate that transplanted hPSC-derived V2a interneurons in-
tegrate with the host tissue of the adult murine spinal cord.
Discussion
This study describes a successful differentiation of excitatory V2a
interneurons from hPSCs using developmental signaling mor-
phogens (RA and Shh agonists) to specify p2 progenitors in
combination with Notch inhibition to direct V2a commitment.
Initially, we tested a combination of RA, pur, and DAPT con-
centrations, similar to those used to promote V2a differentiation
of murine ESCs (25) but applied over a comparable time scale for
hPSC motor neuron differentiation (11). Compared with motor
neuron differentiation, lower concentrations of RA (100 nM vs.
1 μM) increased the relative percentage of CHX10+ cells (Fig. 1 C–E).
In addition to the well-known caudalizing effects of RA on hindbrain
and spinal neuron populations (20, 28), dorsoventral RA signaling
gradients also can impact progenitor domain specification during
development (20, 29, 30). In addition, a reduced concentration of Shh
agonist (100 nM), compared with that required for motor neuron
differentiation (1 μM), increased the relative percentage of CHX10+
cells derived from hPSCs, analogous to dorsoventral patterning of the
developing neural tube. Consistent with previous reports of PSC-
directed differentiation to neural lineages (8, 31), V2a fate specifica-
tion is sensitive to subtle in vitro changes in concentrations of the
signaling molecules that pattern the neural tube. The observed vari-
ability in the yield of CHX10+ cells between experiments and different
cell lines (SI Appendix, Fig. S2B) could been related to a number of
technical reasons that commonly afflict hPSC differentiation effi-
ciency, such as genomic differences between cell lines, variable up-
stream isolation/derivation/culture methods before differentiation
studies, lack of synchrony among hPSCs at the start of differentiation,
and variable concentrations of endogenously produced factors.
Although coincident RA and Shh signaling pathways pattern
progenitor domains in the developing neural tube, inhibition of
Notch signaling is critical to the specification of V2a interneu-
rons (Fig. 1G). The effects of Notch inhibition on hPSC V2a
interneuron differentiation are likely two-pronged: increased
hPSC neurogenesis (βIII tubulin+) and promotion of V2a inter-
neuron (CHX10+ and SOX14+) specification instead of V2b
(GATA3+). Notch inhibition of PSCs undergoing neural differ-
entiation generally enhances neurogenesis (32, 33). In our study,
the proportion of neuronal cells was increased by inhibiting
Notch in the V2a interneuron cultures compared with the motor
neuron cultures that lacked DAPT treatment (Fig. 3 C, i and ii
and D). Notch signaling also regulates the balance between
V2 committed cell types emanating from the p2 progenitor do-
main (24, 34). Expression of the V2b marker GATA3 was low (a
less than twofold increase over hPSCs) when Notch signaling was
inhibited with DAPT (Fig. 2C), and expression of V2a tran-
scription factors CHX10 and SOX14 was increased by ∼100-fold
compared with motor neuron cultures that lacked Notch in-
hibition (Fig. 3D). Thus, inhibition of Notch signaling is critical
to the specification of human V2a interneurons from hPSCs and
exerts a compounded effect by increasing the neuronal pool
along with specifying V2a interneurons from the p2 domain.
Single-cell RNAseq analysis enabled a comprehensive analysis
of the cell population at day 17 of the V2a interneuron differen-
tiation. K-means clustering of 12 principal components revealed
that CHX10+ cells were contained largely within a single cluster
(cluster B; Fig. 4 A and B) that was enriched with cells of an ex-
citatory neuronal phenotype and hindbrain/cervical identity, based
on coincident expression of several genes (OAT, PCP4, and
HOXB5). The majority of differentiated cells appeared to be
committed to a neuronal fate, with distinct subpopulations (clusters
A, B, D, E, and F) differing largely on the basis of stage of dif-
ferentiation or activity (i.e., metabolic, mitotic) (Fig. 4 E and F),
thus providing a snapshot of a dynamic differentiation process. It is
not surprising that a small population of glial cells (cluster C) was
detected along with a few nonneural cells (mesenchymal/muscle)
when starting from PSCs, and glial cells can provide necessary
support of neurons and promote maturation (35). Overall, our
single-cell transcriptome results largely agreed with bulk gene
analysis (Fig. 2) and confirmed the effective differentiation of ex-
citatory neurons with phenotypic properties of V2a interneurons.
Maturation of hPSC-derived V2a interneurons is important to
their physiological function and potential efficacy as a thera-
peutic cell type. However, a major challenge to the entire field of
stem cell research is the relatively immature phenotype of most
hPSC-derived cells, especially in vitro (36). Assessing V2a in-
terneuron maturation over time was difficult in heterogeneous
cultures owing to decreased expression of CHX10 and dilution
by other neuronal and nonneuronal cell types (SI Appendix, Figs.
S7 and S8). Electrophysiological analysis revealed that neurons

 in V2a cultures exhibited nascent signs of maturation over time,
based on increased action potential frequency in response to
current injection (SI Appendix, Fig. S9E, ii). Prospective studies
of single cells or highly enriched populations of CHX10+ cells
are needed to rigorously define the phenotypic markers and
electrophysiological properties of human V2a interneurons.
To examine survival and maturation within the native CNS
environment, hPSC-derived V2a interneurons were transplanted
into the adult murine spinal cord. Transplanted human cells
in the spinal cord exhibited limited migration, with the majority
of HNA+ and Stem121+ cells found within 1 mm of the trans-
plantation site. However, numerous Stem121+ processes resem-
bling axons projected out from the sites of transplantation and were
identified at least 5 mm away, similar to endogenous murine V2a
interneurons that can extend over four spinal segments (>2.5 mm)
in the rostral and caudal directions (37). Although transplanted
CHX10+ human V2a interneurons matured into glutamatergic
neurons expressing NeuN and VGlut2, whether human V2a in-
terneurons adopt an appropriate laminar location and rostral/
caudal phenotype depending on the site of transplantation re-
mains to be clarified. Functional integration of transplanted V2a
interneuron cultures within spinal cord tissue was suggested by
the expression of presynaptic (synaptophysin) and postsynaptic
(HOMER and GRIP1) markers at the interface of transplanted
cell neurites and host neurons (SI Appendix, Fig. S10 E–M). In
future studies, it will be necessary to functionally assess the
electrical connectivity of human V2a interneurons with endog-
enous spinal neurons to determine whether proper synapses with
motor circuits are formed. The lack of teratoma formation and
absence of Oct4+ cells in histological sections indicated that
nonpurified, but highly enriched, V2a interneuron cultures were
safe for transplantation. Overall, these data demonstrate that
hPSC-derived V2a interneurons survive, adopt a glutamatergic
phenotype, extend long-distance axons, and form putative syn-
apses with host neurons when transplanted into the adult murine
spinal cord.
In conclusion, this report provides a description of V2a in-
terneurons differentiated from hPSCs through manipulation of
RA, Shh, and Notch signaling pathways. These cells provide
insight into the phenotypic properties of human V2a interneu-
rons and represent a potent new candidate for regenerative cell
therapies to treat CNS injuries and restore motor function.
Methods
All work with human ESC and iPSC lines was approved by the University
of California – San Francisco Human Gamete, Embryo and Stem Cell Research
(GESCR) Committee. All human PSC lines were grown to 70% confluence and
passaged as single cells every 3 d. Dissociated cells were replated on Matrigel-
coated cultureware at a density of 10,000 cells per cm2 with 10 μM ROCK inhibitor
in mTeSR. The experimental procedures, including V2a interneuron differentia-
tion, neuronal maturation, endpoint analysis, imaging analysis and quantification,
electrophysiology testing, single-cell RNAseq, spinal transplantation, and statistical
analysis, are described in detail in SI Appendix, Methods.
