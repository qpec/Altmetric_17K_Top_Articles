 REVIEW
IL-17 cytokines in immunity and inflammation
Wei Jin1 and Chen Dong1,2
Interleukin 17 (IL-17) and its closest relative, IL-17F, have recently drawn much attention in the field of immunology. IL-17 and IL-17F
are expressed by a distinct type of T cells, T helper 17 cells and certain other lymphocytes. These cytokines play key regulatory roles in
host defense and inflammatory diseases. In this review, we summarize the recent findings in IL-17 biology and the progress towards
understanding the regulatory mechanisms of IL-17 expression and signaling mechanisms. This knowledge will benefit the development
of novel immune modulators that enhance immunity to various infections and reduce inflammatory damage in infected patients.

INTRODUCTION
There are six members in the interleukin 17 (IL-17) cytokine family,
including IL-17A (commonly referred to as IL-17), IL-17B, IL-17C,
IL-17D, IL-17E (also known as IL-25) and IL-17F. Among all the
members, the biological function and regulation of IL-17A and IL-
17F are best understood. These two cytokines share the strongest
sequence homology. The genes encoding IL-17A and IL-17F are close
to each other on the same chromosome in both mouse and human,
underscoring their shared patterns of expression.1 Functionally, both
IL-17A and IL-17F mediate pro-inflammatory responses, with certain
differences depending on the type and site of inflammation.2,3 IL-25
has the least sequence similarity with IL-17A, only 16% compared with
50% in the case of IL-17F. Correspondingly, IL-25 plays distinct roles
in immunity, mainly regulating the T helper (Th) 2 response against
helminthic parasites and allergic inflammation.4–6 IL-17B, IL-17C and
IL-17D have been shown to induce the production of pro-inflamma-
tory cytokines, but their biological function is largely unknown.7–10
Recent studies by three different groups highlighted the function of IL-
17C in mucosal immunity and autoimmune responses.11–13
IL-17 family cytokines mediate their biological functions via surface
receptors on target cells. IL-17RA was the first identified IL-17 recep-
tor, and four other IL-17R family members, IL-17RB, IL-17RC, IL-
17RD and IL-17RE, were subsequently identified, largely based on
their sequence similarity with IL-17RA. Functional receptors for IL-
17 family cytokines often exist in the form of heterodimers, with
IL-17RA as a common subunit. For example, the receptor complex
consisting of IL-17RA and IL-17RC recognizes IL-17A and IL-17F,
whereas IL-17RA pairs with IL-17RB, followed by binding to IL-
25.14,15 Recently, IL-17RE was identified as a receptor for IL-17C in
complex with IL-17RA.11–13 In this article, we summarize recent deve-
lopments in our understanding of the function, signaling and regu-
lation of IL-17A and IL-17F cytokines.
CELLULAR SOURCES OF IL-17A AND IL-17F
Specialized T cells, called Th17 cells, are the major source of IL-17A
and IL-17F in many types of adaptive immunity. Recent studies in the
field also identified other contributors to IL-17A and IL-17F produc-
tion, mainly in the innate arm of the immune system. IL-17 derived
from innate and adaptive sources may fight against pathogen invasion
at different phases and locations of infection, which may add further
complexity and a safeguard to the defensive immune response.
Th17 cells
IL-17A was initially reported to be mainly expressed by activated cluster
of differentiation 41 (CD41) T cells.16 Naive CD41 T cells can dif-
ferentiate into the Th1 or Th2 lineage upon stimulation, depending on
the exogenous cytokine environment. IL-12 and IL-4 drive the develop-
ment of Th1 and Th2 lineage cells, respectively.17 As separate lineages,
Th1 and Th2 cells express unique transcription factors, secrete a distinct
set of cytokines and mediate specific immune responses. Earlier studies
did not classify IL-17A-producing CD41 T cells into either Th1 or Th2
subsets.18–20 The discovery that inducible T-cell costimulator and IL-23
selectively regulate IL-17A-producing CD41 T cells suggests that these
cells are a separate helper cell subset.21–23 Two reports conclusively
demonstrated that antigen-specific IL-17A1CD41 T cells could be effi-
ciently generated, independent of Th1 or Th2 cell development.24,25 In
agreement with this idea, the differentiation of IL-17A-producing
CD41 cells requires a novel set of transcription factors that do not
overlap with those factors required for Th1 or Th2 cells, including signal
transducer and activator of transcription 3 (Stat3), retinoic acid recep-
tor related orphan receptor c (RORc), retinoic acid receptor-related
orphan receptor a, nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of acti-
vated B (NF-kB) cells, inhibitor zeta (IkBf) and basic leucine zipper
transcription factor (Batf), reinforcing IL-17A- and IL-17F-producing
Th17 cells as a new T-cell lineage.26 The upregulation and function of
these factors require signals from the cytokines transforming growth
factor (TGF)-b and IL-6.27
IL-17A-producing Th17 cells are barely detectable in unmanipu-
lated mice according to Hirota and colleagues,28 who used an IL-17A
reporter system. The researchers generated mice with Cre under the
control of the IL-17A promoter. These mice were then crossed with
reporter mice expressing enhanced yellow fluorescence protein (eYFP)

 following Cre upregulation. Any cells that expressed IL-17A would be
marked as eYFP-positive. When the reporter mice were challenged
with myelin oligodendrocyte peptide to induce experimental auto-
immune encephalomyelitis (EAE), Th17 cells were gradually induced
and represented the major IL-17A-expressing cell population infilt-
rating the spinal cords of the diseased mice. The coexistence of
eYFP1IL-17A–CD41 cells together with eYFP1IL-17A1CD41 cells
suggested the plasticity of Th17 cells under autoimmune inflamma-
tory conditions. In contrast, Th17 cells generated during acute inflam-
mation against Candida albicans maintained their signature cytokine
expression, most of which were eYFP1IL-17A1.
Although Th17 cells are blamed for IL-17-driven autoimmune dis-
eases, not all Th17 cells are pathogenic. Recent studies by Kuchroo’s
group identified a subpopulation of Th17 cells that is highly patho-
genic and can induce EAE.29 Generation of the pathogenic Th17 cells
requires IL-23 stimulation following IL-6 and TGF-b1 stimulation,
which induces production of TGF-b3 in Th17 cells. TGF-b3 together
with IL-6 drives the development of Th17 cells with a distinct gene
expression profile compared with their non-pathogenic counterparts,
which are induced by TGF-b1 and IL-6. Consistent with the molecular
signature, pathogenic Th17 cells have a higher expression and activity
of the signal transducers mothers against decapentaplegic homolog 1
(Smad1) and Smad5, whereas Smad2 and Smad3 are more active in
non-pathogenic Th17 cells. The above data suggest the existence of
functionally diverse Th17 subpopulations. Further investigation to
understand the differential regulatory mechanisms of these cells will
be of great therapeutic importance for the manipulation of Th17 cells
under specific clinical situations.
cdT cells
In addition to Th17 cells, there are several types of innate immune cells
that also produce IL-17A and IL-17F, among which cdT cells are the
best understood. cdT cells are a special population of T cells that
comprises 1%–5% of the total lymphocytes in both human and
mouse.30 These cells are localized to mucosal tissues, such as the
intestine, skin and lung, which constantly interact with the outside
environment and can respond via their expression of Toll-like recep-
tors.31,32 cdT cells can rapidly react to antigen and initiate an innate-
like immune response by producing immunoregulatory mediators as
the first line of defence. This phenomenon is especially true for the IL-
17-producing subset of cdT cells. Many studies have shown that cdT
cells and the IL-17 that these cells produce are important in early
defense against bacterial infection. Early reports suggested the func-
tional involvement of IL-17-producing cdT cells during Listeria mono-
cytogenes and Mycobacterium infection.33–36
A more recent publication described the dominant role of IL-17-
producing cdT cells in controlling cutaneous Staphylococcus aureus
infection at the innate stage.37 There is an early wave of IL-17A and
IL-17F production observed in infected control mice, which peaks at
8 h and disappears by 24 h post-inoculation. However, this phenom-
enon is not present in cdT cell-deficient mice. A parallel analysis also
showed that cdT cells are the exclusive source of IL-17A and IL-17F in
skin lesions. Mice deficient in cd but not abT cells are highly suscep-
tible to S. aureus compared with control mice and have increased
bacterial load, substantially larger skin lesions and impaired neutro-
phil recruitment. This defect in cdT cell-deficient mice closely resem-
bles that of IL-17R-mutant mice and can be rescued by exogenous
IL-17A. In a different case of C. albicans infection, IL-17-producing
cdT cells worked together in the acute phase, with progressive involve-
ment by Th17 cells, to clear the fungi invading the body.28
Other IL-17-producing cells
In addition to cdT cells, another innate subtype of T cells that
expresses IL-17 during intestinal bacterial infection has recently
been identified.38 The authors named this special T-cell subtype
innate Th17 (iTh17) cells. iTh17 cells are abT cells residing in the
lamina propria of the intestine. These cells promptly respond to
the enteric bacteria Citrobacter rodentium and Salmonella typhi-
murium at the early stage of infection and are the major producers
of IL-17 in the cecum. The development of iTh17 cells requires IL-
6 and nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing
protein 1/nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing
protein 2 signaling. Despite this interesting finding, the develop-
ment, regulation and function of iTh17 cells require further
investigation.
Lastly, IL-17 can also be produced by several other innate immune
cell types, such as lymphoid tissue inducer cells, natural killer and
natural killer T cells, macrophages and Paneth cells (reviewed in refer-
ences 39 and 40). The functional importance of the IL-17 produced by
these cell types during inflammation is not very well characterized.
IL-17A AND IL-17F IN HOST DEFENSE AND INFLAMMATORY
DISEASES
Function of IL-17A and IL-17F in defensive immunity
IL-17A and IL-17F play protective roles in host defense against certain
pathogens at epithelial and mucosal barriers. These cytokines are
important for the clearance of the extracellular bacteria S. aureus, C.
rodentium and Klebsiella pneumoniae, which infect the skin, colon and
lung, respectively.2,37,41 IL-17A and IL-17F have largely redundant
function in defense against S. aureus because animals become more
sensitive to the bacterium only when both cytokines are defective.2
However, the two cytokines are both required in the case of C. roden-
tium. At an early stage of infection (day 7), IL-17A and IL-17F are
equally important in controlling the bacterial burden, whereas at later
stages (days 14 and 21), IL-17F is more critical, and IL-17A becomes
less important, despite still being functional.2 IL-17A also contributes
to pro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine production upon K.
pneumoniae challenge, as Il17a–/– mice display a significantly
decreased level of these inflammatory mediators.41 It has also been
reported that IL-17A-producing cells are detected upon infection with
intracellular bacteria such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, L. monocy-
togenes and S. typhimurium.33–35,42 A defect in IL-17A or IL-17RA
results in increased bacterial dissemination, correlating with reduced
inflammatory mediators and neutrophil recruitment.
In addition to its role in bacterial immunity, IL-17A is involved
in controlling fungal infection. In one study, a blockade of IL-17A
by neutralizing antibodies during Pneumocystis carinii infection sig-
nificantly increased the pathogen burden and exacerbated the dis-
ease.43 Il17a–/– mice also show increased susceptibility to systemic
C. albicans infection, with a much lower survival rate compared
with wild-type controls.44 Human patients with hyper-IgE syn-
drome, who have defective IL-17A/F production due to a genetic
mutation in the STAT3 gene, suffer from high susceptibility to S.
aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae and C. albicans infection, further
indicating the protective roles of IL-17A and IL-17F in immune
responses against these pathogens.45 IL-17A and IL-17F mediate
their immunological function by inducing pro-inflammatory cyto-
kine, anti-pathogenic peptide and chemokine secretion by respon-
der cells. The release of these pro-inflammatory molecules triggers
the recruitment of innate immune cells to the site of infection and
elimination of the pathogen.
IL-17 cytokines in immunity and inflammation

Emerging Microbes and Infections
 Involvement of IL-17A and IL-17F in chronic inflammation and
autoimmunity
Although crucial in protecting the host from invasion by many types of
pathogens, dysregulated IL-17A and IL-17F production can result in
excessive pro-inflammatory cytokine expression and chronic inflam-
mation, which lead to tissue damage and autoimmunity. IL-17 family
cytokines have been linked to many autoimmune diseases, including
multiple sclerosis (MS), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), inflammatory
bowel disease and psoriasis. MS, for a long time, was considered as a
Th1-dependent disease, until studies revealed the key role of Th17 cells
and IL-17 family cytokines in the development of MS using EAE, a
mouse model resembling human MS.21,25 Th17 cells and associated
cytokines are the major force that drives the related central nervous
system inflammation and lesion formation.21,25
IL-17A is readily detected in the synovial fluids and synovium of RA
patients.46 Several studies using mouse models of RA have demon-
strated a key role for IL-17A in the progression of disease.22,47–50 A
blockade of IL-17 after disease onset effectively prevents bone and
cartilage erosion and reduces the severity of clinical symptoms.49
The broad involvement of IL-17A in many autoimmune diseases
makes this cytokine an ideal drug target. Indeed, humanized IL-17A
antibodies have been developed for the treatment of RA, psoriasis and
uveitis, with favorable outcomes.51,52
Distinct roles of IL-17A and IL-17F
IL-17A and IL-17F, which have identical receptors, may easily be
assumed to function redundantly in promoting inflammation.
However, these two highly related cytokine genes also play non-over-
lapping, and even opposite, roles in certain cases.2,3 In the EAE model,
only Il17a–/– mice show a significantly reduced disease score, indi-
cating the requirement for IL-17A but not IL-17F in the initiation of
EAE. In addition, IL-17A promotes inflammation in an asthma model,
with a reduction of eosinophil infiltration into the airway in Il17a–/–
mice. In contrast, Il17f–/– animals exhibit higher Th2 cytokine and
eosinophil infiltration,3 suggesting a suppressive function for IL-17F
in asthma. Furthermore, IL-17A is protective, whereas IL-17F is
pathogenic, in dextran sulfate sodium-induced acute colitis.
MECHANISMS OF IL-17A AND IL-17F SIGNALING
Responder cells of IL-17A and IL-17F
IL-17A mainly mediates its immune regulatory function by promot-
ing the generation of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines,
which leads to the attraction of neutrophils and macrophages to the
inflammation site. The receptor for IL-17A is widely expressed among
non-haematopoietic cells, such as fibroblasts and epithelial cells, and
among innate immune cells, such as macrophages and neutrophils.
The treatment of fibroblasts with IL-17A results in the upregulation of
several cytokines, including chemokine (C–X–C motif) ligand 1
(CXCL1), chemokine (C–C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2), CCL7, CCL20
and matrix metalloproteinase 3 and 13.25 Similar results were
obtained using a lung epithelial cell line.25 Due to strong sequence
homology with IL-17A, IL-17F can induce the production of pro-
inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor
and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor) and chemo-
kines (CXCL1, CXCL2 and CXCL5) and promote granulopoiesis and
neutrophil recruitment, albeit less potently than IL-17A.3,53,54
IL-17A, IL-17F and the IL-17A/F heterodimer mediate their function
through a heterodimeric receptor complex of IL-17RA and IL-17RC.15
A lack of either IL-17RA or IL-17RC completely abolishes the inflam-
matory function of both cytokines. However, IL-17RA and IL-17RC are
not equal in binding affinity for the two cytokines, which may affect the
cytokine activity, thereby contributing to the functional differences of
IL-17A and IL-17F.55–57 In humans, IL-17A is selectively inhibited by
soluble IL-17RA, whereas soluble IL-17RC inhibits IL-17F, and the
soluble heterodimeric IL-17RA/IL-17RC protein suppresses IL-17A/
IL-17F function.57 The expression patterns of IL-17RA and IL-17RC
are also different. In contrast to the ubiquitously expressed IL-17RA, IL-
17RC is mainly detected in tissue-resident and non-hematopoietic
cells.55 The partially overlapping expression patterns of IL-17RA and
IL-17RC provide a further explanation for the redundant yet distinct
functions of IL-17A and IL-17F.
Signal transduction of IL-17A and IL-17F
Signaling downstream of IL-17R mediates NF-kB and mitogen-acti-
vated protein kinase (MAPK) activation, leading to the production of
pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines and subsequent myeloid
cell recruitment to the inflamed tissue.58,59 Although the signaling
events induced by IL-17A/F are not fully understood, several key sig-
naling molecules have been successfully identified.
Tumor-necrosis factor receptor-associated factor (TRAF6). Early
studies performed by Cao and colleagues60 revealed the indispensable
role of TRAF6, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, in activating the NF-kB and
MAPK pathways downstream of IL-17R. IL-17A fails to induce NF-kB
and c-Jun N-terminal kinase activation in TRAF6-deficient mouse
embryonic fibroblasts.60 Protein sequence alignment has identified
certain homology between the IL-17R family and the Toll-like recep-
tor/IL-1 receptor family, which also requires TRAF6 as a signaling
intermediate.61 Despite these shared features between the two path-
ways, IL-17R signaling does not utilize the same set of adaptor mole-
cules, such as myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 or IL-1
receptor-associated kinase 4, as Toll-like receptor/IL-1 receptor sig-
naling.62 In addition, IL-17RA does not contain a TRAF6 binding site,
indicating the existence of another adaptor molecule that mediates
TRAF6 association with IL-17RA.61
NF-kB activator 1 (Act1). Act1 was previously reported to associate
with TRAF6 and to mediate NF-kB and activator protein 1 activa-
tion.63 Act1 shares sequence homology with the cytoplasmic domain
of the IL-17R family and is reported to directly interact with the
cytoplasmic domain of IL-17RA.62 Therefore, it is reasonable to hypo-
thesize that Act1 may function as an adaptor and recruit TRAF6 to
IL-17RA. Act1-deficient cells fail to activate NF-kB and MAPKs upon
IL-17A stimulation and thus cannot produce pro-inflammatory mole-
cules, such as IL-6 and CXCL1.62,64 Consistent with the in vitro data,
Act-1-deficient mice show much reduced inflammatory disease in vivo
in both autoimmune encephalomyelitis and dextran sulfate sodium-
induced colitis.65 TRAF6 is dispensable for IL-17A-induced extracel-
lular signal-regulated kinase and p38 activation, which promotes the
stabilization of certain chemokine mRNA, suggesting the presence of
an Act1-mediated but TRAF6-independent pathway downstream of
IL-17R.66 Because IL-17F shares its receptor with IL-17A, Act1 also
plays an indispensable role in IL-17F signaling.3
IkB kinase I (IKKi). As an E3 ubiquitin ligase, Act1 mediates the K63
ubiquitination and activation of TRAF6. However, how Act1 is acti-
vated and regulated is unknown. Work performed by the Li’s67 group
provided new insights into the answer to this question. The authors
identified IKKi as a binding partner of Act1 and confirmed the asso-
ciation in primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Experiments using

 airway epithelial cells from IKKi-deficient mice demonstrated the
unique role of IKKi in IL-17A-induced, Act1-dependent MAPK
activation, but IKKi was dispensable for TRAF6-dependent NF-
kB activation. Cells lacking IKKi are defective in pro-inflammatory
molecule induction and chemokine mRNA stabilization. Indeed,
IKKi-deficient mice display decreased lung inflammation with
reduced amounts of CXCL1 expression and neutrophil infiltration
when challenged with IL-17A intranasally. IKKi associates with Act1
and phosphorylates Act1 on Ser311 upon IL-17A stimulation. This
phosphorylation is functionally important because mutation at this
site abolishes Act1-dependent MAPK activation and chemokine
mRNA stabilization but leaves the NF-kB pathway intact. These
findings established the unexpected role of IKKi as an Act1 kinase
specifically upstream of the Act1–MAPK signalling cascade but not
the Act1–TRAF6–NF-kB axis. IKKi and the related TANK-binding
kinase 1 are best known as key signal transducers in innate immune
signaling pathways that activate interferon regulatory factors upon
viral infection.
Ubiquitin-specific processing protease 25 (USP25). IL-17 is of great
importance
for
the
immune
response
to
certain
pathogens.
Unbalanced IL-17A production or dysregulated IL-17R signaling in
responder cells can lead to excessive inflammation and autoimmune
symptoms. Little is known about the molecular mechanism that con-
trols downstream signaling from the IL-17R complex. The Act1-
mediated, K63-linked ubiquitination of TRAF6 is a key signaling event
leading to the activation of NF-kB. To understand the regulatory
mechanism of this process, Zhong and colleagues68 coexpressed vari-
ous deubiquitinating enzymes with an NF-kB luciferase reporter con-
struct and examined the reporter activity upon IL-17A stimulation.
The assay revealed that the overexpression of the USP25 significantly
and specifically inhibited IL-17A- but not TNF-a-mediated NF-kB
activation and the expression of inflammatory mediators. USP25
binds to and deubiquitinates TRAF5 and TRAF6, thereby attenuating
NF-kB and MAPK signal transduction downstream of the IL-17R
complex. USP25-deficient mice displayed an enhanced IL-17A-
mediated inflammatory response when challenged with IL-17A in vivo
or when subjected to IL-17A-related airway inflammation or EAE.
These findings demonstrate the physiological function of USP25 as
a negative regulator of the IL-17R signal transduction pathway.
CONCLUDING REMARKS
Recent studies on IL-17A and IL-17F significantly enhance our under-
standing of protective inflammation during pathogen infection and
chronic inflammation associated with autoimmune diseases. Further
dissection of the source and regulation of IL-17A and IL-17F expres-
sion and these cytokines’ signaling mechanisms may provide ways for
us to modulate the immune system in infectious and inflammatory
diseases.
