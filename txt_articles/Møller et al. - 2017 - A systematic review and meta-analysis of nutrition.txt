ABSTRACT
Background: Despite recommendations, many patients with type 2
diabetes receive dietary advice from nurses or doctors instead of in-
dividualized nutrition therapy (INT) that is provided by a dietitian.
Objective: We performed a meta-analysis to compare the effect of
INT that is provided by a registered dietitian with the effect of dietary
advice that is provided by other healthcare professionals.
Design: A systematic review was conducted of Cochrane library da-
tabases, EMBASE, CINAHL, and MEDLINE in the period 2004–2017
for guidelines, reviews, and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that
assessed the outcomes glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), weight, body
mass index (BMI; in kg/m2), and LDL cholesterol. Risk of bias and the
quality of evidence were assessed according to the Grading of Rec-
ommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation guidelines.
Results: We identified 5 RCTs comprising 912 participants in total.
In the first year of intervention (at 6 or 12 mo), nutrition therapy
compared with dietary advice was followed by a 0.45% (95% CI:
0.36%, 0.53%) lower mean difference in HbA1c, a 0.55 (95% CI:
0.02, 1.1) lower BMI, a 2.1-kg (95% CI: 1.2-, 2.9-kg) lower weight,
and a 0.17-mmol/L (95% CI: 0.11-, 0.23-mmol/L) lower LDL cho-
lesterol. No longer-term data were available. Some of the included
studies had a potential bias, and therefore, the quality of the evi-
dence was low or moderate. In addition, it was necessary to pool
primary and secondary outcomes.
Conclusions: INT that is provided by a dietitian compared with
dietary advice that is provided by other health professionals leads
to a greater effect on HbA1c, weight, and LDL cholesterol. Because
of the potential bias, we recommend considering nutrition therapy
that is provided by a dietitian as part of lifestyle intervention in type
2 diabetes, but further randomized studies are warranted.

INTRODUCTION
Nutrition therapy is an integral part of the treatment of type 2
diabetes, and together with self-management education and
physical activity, it has beneficial effects on weight, metabolic
control, and general wellbeing. International guidelines have
recommended that all individuals with diabetes should receive
individualized nutrition therapy (INT), preferably that which is
provided by a dietitian with specific expertise and skills in nu-
trition therapy (1–3).
Despite these recommendations (1), many patients with type 2
diabetes receive dietary advice from nurses or doctors instead
of INT that is provided by a dietitian. Before randomization to
receive early medication in the UK Prospective Diabetes Study
of newly diagnosed type 2 diabetic subjects, a change in diet
that was achieved with INT was associated with a reduction of
#2 percentage points in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) (4).
Whether a similar effect can be achieved merely by dietary
advice is unclear. Therefore, we have focused on the evidence
from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of INT compared with
dietary advice in a setting in which other elements of a lifestyle
intervention are comparable.
The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of nutrition
therapy (nutrition assessment, nutrition education and counsel-
ing, and monitoring and evaluation) that is provided by a reg-
istered dietitian compared with dietary advice that is provided by
other healthcare professionals. By searching the literature for
high-quality randomized trials and subsequent meta-analyses, we
aimed to identify and quantify the possible different effects on
selected clinical outcomes.
METHODS
Eligibility criteria
We specified eligibility criteria for the search and meta-analyses
using the determination of the population, intervention, compar-
ison, and outcomes approach. We subsequently defined the fol-
lowing specific question to be explored in the literature: Is nutrition
therapy superior to dietary advice in patients with type 2 diabetes?
The population comprised subjects with type 2 diabetes on the
basis of clinical criteria. The intervention was nutrition therapy
compared with dietary advice in RCTs. The selected primary

 outcomes of the analysis were glycemic control (HbA1c) and
BMI (in kg/m2) after $1 y. Secondary outcomes were HbA1c,
BMI or weight, and LDL cholesterol before 1 y. Other outcomes
were quality of life and dropout rates. Anthropomorphic data
were not considered because they were expected to be limited.
Information sources and search strategy
A research librarian performed a systematic literature search of
the following databases: EMBASE (www.elsevier.com/solutions/
embase-biomedical-research), MEDLINE (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
pubmed), CINAHL (www.ebscohost.com/nursing/products/cinahl-
databases/cinahl-complete), and Cochrane Library (www.
cochranelibrary.com) databases. Primarily, the literature search was
performed in October 2014. The search was limited to references
that were published in English or Scandinavian languages from
January to October 2014. The following 3 searches were made: 1)
for guidelines, 2) for reviews, and 3) for RCTs. The results of all
searches were entered into the Covidence software program (2014
version) for analyses (5). In April 2017, we performed a supple-
mentary search for guidelines, reviews, and RCTs that were pub-
lished from October 2014 to April 2017.
Study selection
After each search, on the basis of titles and abstracts, one
author (OS) extracted relevant reports and papers for a full-text
evaluation by 2 independent authors (GM, HKA, or OS). Only
high-quality guidelines that were based, first, on the Grading of
Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation
(GRADE) guidelines or similar evaluation systems and, second,
on systematic reviews of RCTs were included. Clinical guide-
lines were evaluated with the use of Appraisal of Guidelines for
Research and Evaluation II software (AGREE II; Agree Next
Steps Consortium, www.agreetrust.org) (6) if they were relevant
to the issue we were addressing. Similarly, systematic reviews
were evaluated with the use of A Measurement Tool to Assess
Systematic Reviews (7).
Evaluations were performed by 2 independent authors (GM,
HKA, or OS). Disagreements were primarily resolved through
discussions and, second, by the third author.
Data-collection process and risk of bias in
individual studies
Two reviewers independently extracted data from the included
RCTs and recorded details about study designs, interventions,
participants, and outcome measures.
Risk of bias was assessed against the following key criteria: a
random-sequence generation; allocation concealment; blinding
of participants, personnel, and assessors; incomplete outcome
data; selective outcome reporting; and other sources of bias in
accordance with the recommendations of the Cochrane Collab-
oration (8). The following ranking was used: Low risk, high risk,
or unclear (either a lack of information or uncertainty over a
potential bias). Authors resolved disagreements by consensus and
consulted a third author if necessary.
RESULTS
The search revealed 5 guidelines on the basis of GRADE
guidelines or other comparable evaluation systems. Three of
these guidelines (2, 9, 10) were of sufficient quality according to
the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation, but
none of them addressed the issues of the present review.
Seven reviews formed the primary search, and 4 reviews from
the supplementary search were selected for full-text assessment
(Figure 1). The predefined criteria for entering the analysis and
the issues we addressed were not fulfilled in any of the reviews.
From the primary search for RCTs, 2 studies were included (11,
12), and from the supplementary search, 1 study was included in
the analysis (13). In addition, we included 1 older study (14) that
fulfilled the criteria and 1 study (15) from the primary search after
a mutual reassessment. Both of the studies have been cited in
previous and present American guidelines (1, 16).
Study characteristics and risk of bias
All trials were conducted in outpatient settings. Four trials
used a parallel RCT design (11, 12, 14, 15), and 1 trial used
cluster randomization with each cluster representing a commu-
nity (13). In total, 912 subjects with type 2 diabetes were in-
cluded. Only the groups who were randomly assigned to nutrition
therapy and dietary advice were included and not the group

 who was randomly assigned to nutrition therapy and exercise
(n = 246) from the study by Andrews et al. (11).
Study characteristics are shown in Table 1. The mean age of
participants was 57–63 y, and 53% of participants were men.
The duration of interventions was 6 mo in 2 trials and 12 mo in 3
trials. Relevant outcomes from the ends of trials were available.
BMI before 1 y and HbA1c after 1 y and later were primary
outcomes. Therefore, to make a meaningful analysis, we pooled
results after 6 or 12 mo in the meta-analysis although they
represented a mixture of primary and secondary outcomes.
The number of nutrition-therapy sessions ranged from 3 to 6.
The duration of each session was unclear in most of the trials.
Nutrition therapy was provided by a dietitian with specific ex-
pertise and skills in diabetes and nutrition.
There were no differences in baseline characteristics between
groups in the individual studies except in the study by Huang
et al. (12) in which patients in the control group had both higher
BMI and higher diastolic blood pressure than those of the in-
tervention group at baseline.
Between studies, baseline BMI was much lower in the 2 Asian
studies (26–27) (12, 13) than in the studies of non-Asians (33–
35). HbA1c was close to normal (6.5%) at baseline in the study
by Andrews et al. (11), just ,8% in the study by Liu et al. (13),
and .8% in the other studies (12, 14, 15).
Risk of bias was assessed from the available information via
the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool (8). In all 5 studies, subjects were
randomly assigned before the intervention. A random-sequence–
generation method was stated in the studies by Andrews et al.
(11), Huang et al. (12), and Coppell et al. (15) but not in the
studies by Liu et al. (13) and Franz et al. (14). In the Chinese
study, 2 communities were randomly assigned to either the in-
tervention or a control (13). This assignment represented high
risks of recruitment and selection bias. Allocation concealment
was stated in the studies by Andrews et al. (11) and Coppell
et al. (15). The blinding of participants and personnel (perfor-
mance bias) was not possible in the present studies, but this
aspect was considered an important component of the overall
risk-of-bias assessment. In the study by Andrews et al. (11), the
participants were informed about the intervention, which led to
high risk of performance bias. The blinding of outcome asses-
sors was reported in 4 studies. Apart from the study by Andrews
et al. (11), the method of follow-up was unclear in the control
groups. No other potential sources of bias were identified from
the studies.

1 Patient or population consisted of patients with type 2 diabetes in an outpatient setting. The intervention was nutrition
therapy and was compared with dietary advice. GRADE working group grades of evidence were as follows—high quality:
further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect; moderate quality: further research is
likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate; low quality:
further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change
the estimate; and very low quality: we are very uncertain about the estimate. Outcomes are for 6- or 12-mo results.

 Overall, risk of bias was assessed as being low in 3 of the
included studies (11, 12, 15). In the older study by Franz et al.
(14), the paper was unclear for most of the components, and the
study by Liu et al. (13) has high risk of bias.
Effects of the intervention
Table 2 shows the summary of finding of the meta-analysis.
Figures 2–5 show Forest plots of the outcomes. Compared with
dietary advice, nutrition therapy (INT) was followed by a 0.45-
percentage point (95% CI: 0.36-, 0.53-percentage point) lower
mean HbA1c (Figure 2) in the first year (at 6 or 12 mo), body
weight was 2.1 kg (95% CI: 1.2, 2.9 kg) lower (Figure 3), BMI
was 0.55 (95% CI: 0.02, 1.1) lower (Figure 4), and LDL cho-
lesterol was 0.17 mmol/L (95% CI: 0.11, 0.23 mmol/L) lower
(Figure 5). No long-term data on HbA1c or body weight were
reported, and studies contained no reports on the quality of life.
In the studies by Andrews et al. (11) and Coppell et al. (15),
waist circumference at 12 and 6 mo decreased 2.8 and 1.6 cm
more, respectively, in the nutrition-therapy groups. The waist-to-
hip ratio was unchanged in the study by Franz et al. (14), and the
studies by Huang et al. (12) and Liu et al. (13) contained no
anthropometric measures.
Dropouts
The reported dropout rate varied considerably from 2.3% (11)
to 25.3% (12) but with no difference between groups (Table 1).
DISCUSSION
This meta-analysis was conducted according to the GRADE
criteria and shows that INT that was given by certified dietitians
compared with dietary advice that was given by nurses and
doctors was followed by a greater improvement in glycemic
control (HbA1c), a larger loss of weight, and a greater decline
in LDL cholesterol. The effects were seen after 6 or 12 mo of
intervention. No follow-up or longer-term data were available.
To our knowledge, this clinically important effect of nutrition
therapy has not been estimated before in meta-analyses of ran-
domized trials.
For HbA1c, the baseline values in the large, high-quality study
by Andrews et al. (11) were close to the normal range, which could
probably have minimized the overall estimate of the effect of INT
(Figure 2). It is clinically well recognized that the magnitude of the
effect of an intervention on glycemic control depends on the
baseline HbA1c as has been shown in reviews of lifestyle in-
terventions (17, 18). Compared with usual care, the effect of a
lifestyle intervention on HbA1c was limited when baseline values
was ,7.0% (53 mmol/mol). Furthermore, in a review of the effect
of nutrition therapy in prediabetes, HbA1c declined w0.3 per-
centage points compared with the effect of usual care (19).
A number of randomized trials have shown a significant effect
of a lifestyle intervention on glycemic control (HbA1c), weight
and BMI, and quality of life in type 2 diabetes (20). The lifestyle
intervention consisted of patient education and nutrition therapy
and has been especially efficient when it has been based on a self-
management strategy (18) and included exercise (21). However,

 in these studies, the beneficial effect of patient education, nu-
trition therapy, and exercise could not be discriminated.
The observed effect of INT compared with dietary advice on
body weight was of the same magnitude (a reduction of w1.5–
2 kg) as was shown during short-term, self-management educa-
tion programs (20) except in the Action for Health in Diabetes
study study (21) in which a much greater weight reduction after
1 y was shown. The effect of INT on LDL cholesterol has, in
previous studies, been shown to be present only after 1 y of in-
tervention (20, 21).
Limitations
The design of the included studies was comparable, except for
the study by Liu et al. (13). A low HbA1c value at baseline in the
largest and most important study (11) of the review may have led
to an underestimation of the effect of INT. Including short term
secondary outcomes and studies with potential selection and
performance bias may on the other hand have led to an over-
estimation of the effect. The review included Asians patients (12,
13), where including changes in anthropometric measures in the
analysis probably would have been more informative than using
BMI and weight. There were no data on quality of life. No
relevant data from beyond 1 y were available, and it is therefore
unclear whether nutrition therapy with a limited number of
sessions has any long-term effects. The Action for Health in
Diabetes study demonstrated the importance of a continuous
intervention in the maintenance of lifestyle changes (21).
Conclusion
In conclusion, the present review suggests recommending nu-
trition therapy to type 2 diabetic patients in a number of sessions
lead by a certified dietitian rather than giving dietary advice to
adult subjects with type 2 diabetes.

width of the diamond indicates the 95% CI. Risk-of-bias categories were as follows: (A) random-sequence generation, (B) allocation concealment, (C)
blinding of participants and personnel, (D) blinding of outcome assessment, (E) incomplete outcome data, (F) selective reporting, and (G) other bias; green1:
fulfilled, yellow?: data not available, red-: not fulfilled. References listed are Andrews et al. (11), Coppell et al. (15), Franz et al. (14), and Huang et al. (12). IV,
inverse variance.
