SUMMARY
Chronic alcohol abuse results in alcohol-related neurodegeneration, and critical gaps in our knowledge hinder therapeutic development.
Neural stem cells (NSCs) are a subpopulation of cells within the adult brain that contribute to brain maintenance and recovery. While
it is known that alcohol alters NSCs, little is known about how NSC response to alcohol is related to sex, brain region, and stage of dif-
ferentiation. Understanding these relationships will aid in therapeutic development. Here, we used an inducible transgenic mouse model
to track the stages of differentiation of adult endogenous NSCs and observed distinct NSC behaviors in three brain regions (subventricular
zone, subgranular zone, and tanycyte layer) after long-term alcohol consumption. Particularly, chronic alcohol consumption profoundly
affected the survival of NSCs in the subventricular zone and altered NSC differentiation in all three regions. Significant differences
between male and female mice were further discovered.
INTRODUCTION
Alcohol abuse is the third leading cause of preventable
death in the United States, with almost 30% of the popula-
tion meeting the criteria for alcohol use disorder at some
point in life (Grant et al., 2015). It is established that
alcohol misuse has detrimental effects on the brain and
leads to deficits in cognitive and behavioral function,
as well as a condition referred to as alcohol-related neuro-
degeneration (Zahr et al., 2011; Vetreno and Crews, 2015;
Staples and Mandyam, 2016).
Several factors affect the response of the brain to
alcohol, such as age, sex, duration, and quantity of alcohol
consumed (Oscar-Berman and Marinkovic, 2003; Squeglia
et al., 2014). There are also regional patterns of degenera-
tion and glial pathology observed in patients with a history
of chronic alcohol abuse (Pfefferbaum et al., 1992, 1993;
Cullen and Halliday, 1994; Agartz et al., 1999; Zahr et al.,
2011). As with neurodegenerative diseases, neural damage
observed in chronic alcoholism is speculated to be not only
caused by neuronal death, but also by inhibition of neuro-
genic processes (He et al., 2005; Crews et al., 2006; Morris
et al., 2010; Winner et al., 2011). Thus, the effect of alcohol
on neural stem cells (NSCs) has become a topic of interest
due
to
the
critical
role
NSCs
play
in
maintaining
neurogenesis throughout life, and possibly in mediating
neuro-regeneration
after insults (Leasure
and Nixon,
2010; Maynard and Leasure, 2013).
The two most commonly studied NSC-containing re-
gions in the adult brain are the subventricular zone (SVZ)
of the lateral ventricles and the subgranular zone (SGZ) of
the dentate gyrus (Crews and Nixon, 2003; Kempermann
et al., 2015). In these regions, alcohol consumption impairs
NSC proliferation and neurogenesis (Rice et al., 2004;
Crews et al., 2006; Broadwater et al., 2014; McClain et al.,
2011; Campbell et al., 2014). Recently, the tanycyte layer
(TL) of the third ventricle was discovered to contain cells
with NSC properties; however, the impact of alcohol on
this cell population has not been investigated (Robins
et al., 2013). While studies have investigated the effect of
alcohol in the SVZ and SGZ, a comparative examination
of how NSCs in all three regions (SVZ, SGZ, and TL)
respond to alcohol at different stages of differentiation
has not been conducted. Despite the broad knowledge
that males and females respond differently to alcohol clin-
ically, the role of sex differences in NSC response to alcohol
consumption is not well explored. These two unaddressed
issues leave substantial gaps in knowledge of how the brain
recovers following chronic alcohol abuse.
To address these gaps in knowledge, we utilized recent
advances in genetic inducible fate mapping which provides
a tool to study longitudinal changes of endogenous NSC

 populations in the adult brain (Lagace et al., 2007; Taupin,
2007). This technology allows us to evaluate differentiation
and population changes of endogenous NSCs in response
to alcohol. Specifically, we analyzed the effect of chronic
alcohol consumption on NSC populations in adult mice
and concentrated on the three regions in the mouse brain
that are known to contain NSCs: SVZ, SGZ, and TL. In addi-
tion, we compared NSC responses in males and females to
determine the role of sex in response to alcohol.
RESULTS
Differences in Tolerance to Alcohol Consumption
Adult Nestin-CreERT2:R26R-YFP bitransgenic mice were
used to trace the fate of endogenous NSCs following
tamoxifen induction, and chronic ethanol feeding with
the Lieber-DeCarli ethanol liquid diet (Figure 1A). Both
pair-fed control and ethanol-fed mice were given ad libitum
access to their respective diets and water. To ensure that
both ethanol and control mice received diets with the
same caloric value, maltose-dextrin was used to calorie bal-
ance the diets. At the start of the study, males weighed more
than females; however, there was no significant difference
between the body weights of control or ethanol groups
(Figures 1B and 1C). Male mice in both groups had a higher
average daily diet consumption compared with their
female counterparts. Control males consumed 5% more
diet than control females, and ethanol males consumed
7% more than ethanol females (Figure 1D). Due to the
greater consumption, male mice consumed more grams
of ethanol compared with females; however, females
consumed 13% more grams of ethanol per kilogram of
body weight (Figures 1E and 1F). There were no significant
changes in body weight gains, but mice in the ethanol
group tended to have less weight gain (Figure 1G).
Similar to humans, mice showed individual variations
in response to alcohol intake, ranging from ataxia to loss
of righting reflex. To evaluate ethanol intoxication, an
ordinal scale was created based upon home cage behaviors
ranging from asymptomatic to severe on a scale of 0–4,
respectively (Figure 1H). These behaviors have previously
been associated with intoxication in mice (Crabbe et al.,
2008). All animals in the ethanol group tolerated the
2-week
ramping
stage
without
abnormal
behaviors.
Among 25 mice fed with 4% ethanol, 4 males (30.8%)
and 4 females (33.3%) were kept on a sustained 4% ethanol
diet for 28 days with mild symptoms and thus were
included in the ‘‘long-term’’ study. On the other hand,
9 males (69.2%) and 8 females (66.7%) showed severe
symptoms of intoxication reaching a score of 4 between
6 and 24 days with 4% ethanol. Five males and 4 females
died between 6 and 24 days of 4% ethanol, and were not
included in this study. Other mice with severe symptoms
were euthanized between 6 and 11 days and not included
for further histopathological analyses in this study. Ethanol
females displayed more severe symptoms of intoxication
and escalated in severity at a higher rate than males
(p = 0.009) (Figure 1I). Blood alcohol analysis showed a
wide range of blood alcohol concentrations (BACs) and
blood acetaldehyde concentrations, which did not corre-
late with behavioral severity for either sex (Figure S1).
One source of variability may be due to blood samples
collected in the morning, while mice typically feed in the
first few hours of the dark cycle. In addition, since mice
have unrestricted access to the diet it is possible that mice
with higher BACs consumed the diet more recently than
mice with lower BACs.
Effect of Alcohol Consumption on SVZ NSCs in the
Lateral Ventricle
We focused on the rostral lateral ventricle, which harbors
endogenous NSCs and is an area of active neurogenesis in
adult mammalian brains (Lim and Alvarez-Buylla, 2014).
The Nestin-CreERT2;R26R-YFP transgenic mice allowed us
to trace the NSCs that were present at the time of tamoxifen
injection by their expression of yellow fluorescent protein
(YFP) (Lagace et al., 2007). Tamoxifen, administered at
2 months of age, enabled expression of the YFP reporter
gene in Nestin-expressing NSCs in adult mice. The YFP
signal was further enhanced by immunohistochemistry
using a GFP antibody. Since the YFP reporter gene was acti-
vated by tamoxifen, only cells expressing Nestin at the time
of tamoxifen injection would be labeled with YFP. Since
YFP is constitutively active, all progeny cells from that
induced population will also express YFP, regardless of dif-
ferentiation or division. This provides the capacity to study
a population of NSCs and their progeny in response to
alcohol consumption. This genetic tracing technique al-
lowed us to examine three phases of NSCs: NSCs (GFP+),
newly differentiated NSCs (DCX+GFP+ or GFAP+GFP+),
and neurons or astrocytes that were present before tamox-
ifen induction (DCX+ or GFAP+). Cells that were double-
labeled with GFP and a marker of differentiation (DCX or
GFAP) represent newly differentiated cells after tamoxifen
induction of the YFP expression in Nestin+ cells. Cells that

 differentiated prior to tamoxifen induction and no longer
expressed Nestin would not be co-labeled with GFP. In stan-
dard
chow
controls,
there
were
more
DCX+
and
DCX+GFP+, and fewer GFAP+GFP+ cells, indicating that
the liquid diet itself may influence cell proliferation (Patten
et al., 2013) and probably neurogenesis (Figures 2 and 3),
likely due to the high fat in the liquid diet (Park et al.,
2010). Thus, ethanol treatment was compared with liquid
diet controls. Male and female mice on control diets had
comparable numbers of GFP+ NSCs in the SVZ region (Fig-
ures 2A and 2B). Mice receiving the ethanol diet exhibited
significant alterations of SVZ NSCs in a temporal- and sex-
dependent manner. In the SVZ region (indicated by orange
lines), long-term treatment decreased GFP+ cells by 98% in
females and 89% in males (Figures 2A–2D). The total num-
ber of GFP+ cells was reduced by 94% in females and 74% in
males in the origin of the rostral migratory stream (oRMS)
(indicated by the red box) (Figures 2A–2C and 2E).
Next we examined the neurogenic capacity of SVZ NSCs
after ethanol consumption by using the doublecortin
(DCX) antibody, a marker of newly differentiated neuro-
blasts and immature neurons (Klempin et al., 2011). Males
and females receiving the liquid diet had fewer DCX+ and
DCX+GFP+ cells in the oRMS compared with standard
chow controls (Figures 2A–2C, 2F, and 2G). In the liquid
diet controls, DCX+GFP+ accounted for 35% and 22% of
the total GFP cells in control males and females, respectively
(Figures2B and2G).Long-termethanol consumptionsignif-
icantly decreased DCX+ expression by 54% in males and
66% in females (Figures 2C and 2F). In addition, DCX+GFP+
cells were reduced by 82% in males and 87% in females (Fig-
ures 2C and 2G). Males but not females demonstrated a
reduction in the percent of GFP+ cells becoming DCX+
following long-term ethanol consumption (Figure 2H).
The greater loss of DCX+GFP+ cells (Figure 2G) than that of
the total DCX+ cells indicates that recently differentiated
NSCs are more susceptible to ethanol-mediated toxicity
than older differentiated cells. To further confirm the effect
of chronic ethanol consumption on neurogenesis of NSCs,
dual immunolabeling with GFP and NeuN (a mature
neuronal marker) was conducted in the olfactory bulb. As
shown in Figure 3, chronic ethanol treatment significantly
reduced the numbers of newly generated mature neurons
(NeuN+GFP+)andGFP+cellsintheolfactorybulb,exhibiting
a trend similar to DCX+GFP+ in the oRMS (Figure 3).
We further assessed the effect of ethanol consumption on
NSC astroglial differentiation by using glial fibrillary acidic
protein(GFAP)asaglialmarker.IntheSVZregionofthecon-
trol mice, the majority of GFP+ cells were co-labeled with
GFAP (Figures 4A–4C). To determine astrogliogenesis from
the SVZ NSCs expressing GFAP, we quantified those GFP
and GFAP co-labeled cells in the oRMS (indicated by the
red box) (Liu et al., 2010). No significant differences were
found in the number of GFAP+ cells between the standard
chow and control liquid diets; however, females in the
liquid diet control group had significantly less GFAP+ cells
compared with their male counterparts (Figures 4A–4D).
In ethanol-treated mice, males showed a trend of reduction
in GFAP+ cells, albeit statistically insignificant, compared
with both standard chow and control liquid diets (Figures
4C and 4D). GFAP+GFP+ cells decreased by 90% and 97%
in males and females, respectively (Figures 4C and 4E).
Furthermore, the percent of GFP+ cells expressing GFAP+
was significantly reduced in females (92%) and had a
trend of reduction in males (Figure 4F). Ethanol-treated
females hada significantly lowerpercentageofGFP+ cellsex-
pressing GFAP+ compared with their male counterparts. In-
dividual immunohistochemical stain images can be found
in the Supplemental Experimental Procedures (Figure S2).
In summary, these data show the NSCs in the SVZ are
sensitive to long-term ethanol consumption, more so
in females. Chronic ethanol consumption altered neuro-
genesis by inducing a drastic loss of DCX+GFP+ neuro-
blasts/immature neurons in the oRMS, and a subsequent
loss of NeuN+GFP+ in the olfactory bulb. Also, alcohol
consumption decreased the survival of newly differenti-
ated astrocytes (GFAP+GFP+).
Effect of Alcohol Consumption on SGZ NSCs in the
Hippocampus
Next, we examined the SGZ in the dorsal hippocampus,
given its role in cognitive function and active adult neuro-
genesis (Kempermann et al., 2015). The standard chow
controls had similar numbers of GFP+ cells; however, the

 liquid diet controls displayed sex differences, with female
mice in the control group having approximately twice
the number of GFP+ cells as their male counterparts (Fig-
ures 5A–5D). The SGZ GFP+ cells also showed a sex-depen-
dent response to ethanol consumption. Alcohol treatment
significantly reduced the numbers of GFP+ cells in both
males and females (Figures 5C and 5D).
When evaluating SGZ neurogenesis, liquid diet control
males and females had similar levels of DCX+ and
DCX+GFP+ cells. Standard chow controls had significantly
more DCX+ cells compared with liquid diet controls (Fig-
ures 5A, 5B, and 5E). In the long-term ethanol cohort,
DCX+ cells were significantly decreased in males and fe-
males when compared with liquid diet controls (Figures
5A–5C, and 5E). There was a 49% and 65% decrease in males
and females, respectively (Figure 5E). There was also a trend
of reduction in both males and females in the DCX+GFP+
cell population, albeit statistically insignificant (Figures
5C and 5F). Males exhibited a significant reduction (63%)
in the percentage of GFP+ cells labeled with DCX when
compared with both standard chow and liquid diet
controls, whereas females only had a trending decrease
compared with standard chow controls (Figure 5G).
When assessing SGZ astrogliogenesis, we found no sig-
nificant differences in GFAP+, GFAP+GFP+, or percentage
of GFP+ cells expressing GFAP between males and females
within the control diets (Figures 6A, 6B, 6D, and 6E). In
addition, all comparisons between standard chow and con-
trol liquid diets were similar (Figures 6A, 6B, and 6D–6F).
Female mice in the ethanol group had a significant reduc-
tion in GFAP+ cells compared with both standard chow
and liquid diet controls; however, males only had a sig-
nificant reduction relative to the standard chow group
(Figures 6C and 6D). Long-term ethanol consumption did

 not have an impact on GFAP+GFP+ populations, or the per-
centage of GFP+ cells expressing GFAP in males or females
(Figures 6C, 6E, and 6F). These data suggest that GFAP+
populations in the female SGZ are more sensitive to
changes following ethanol consumption compared with
males, and that GFAP+ populations respond differently
to alcohol in the SGZ compared with the SVZ. Individual
immunohistochemical stain images can be found in
Figure S3.
In summary, long-term alcohol consumption reduced
neurogenesis in both males and females. In addition,
females, but not males, had a significant reduction in
GFAP+ cells.
Effect of Chronic Alcohol Consumption on TL NSCs in
the Third Ventricle
The third region we evaluated was the TL of the third
ventricle. This region was selected because it has recently
been shown to contain cells with NSC potential (Robins
et al., 2013; Haan et al., 2013). However, in our study we
found little evidence of newly differentiating neurons
(Figure S4), therefore our primary focus was on GFP+ and
GFAP+ cell populations. In this region GFAP+ cells can label
astrocytes as well as tanycytes, which are specialized epen-
dymal cells with elongated morphology that share charac-
teristics of astrocytes and radial glia (Rodriguez et al., 2005;
Robins et al., 2013). The primary role of tanycytes is to

 communicate chemical signals from the ventricles to the
hypothalamus (Rodriguez et al., 2005). Control mice in
both standard chow and liquid diet groups had similar
numbers of GFP+, GFAP+, and GFAP+GFP+ cells between
both sexes (Figures 7A, 7B, and 7D–7F).
Following long-term ethanol consumption, both males
and females exhibited significant decreases of GFP+ in the
TL region by 56% and 40%, respectively (Figures 7C
and 7D). Interestingly, females had an increase in GFAP+
cells (75%), whereas males experienced a 67% decrease in
GFAP+ cells (Figure 7E). Females did not have a significant
reduction in the number of GFAP+GFP+ cells; however,
males experienced a 67% decrease in GFAP+GFP+ cells
when compared with liquid diet (Figure 7F). Neither males

DISCUSSION
Our study is to employ a genetic inducible fate mapping
model to study the effects of chronic alcohol intake on
adult brain NSCs and their progeny, comparatively, in
three main brain regions in both male and female mice.
A particular interesting finding is the observation of
changes in the hypothalamic NSCs in response to alcohol
consumption. One limitation in this study was the high

 mortality of mice, likely due to the administration of
ethanol since mice in the ethanol group were not given a
choice of control diet. However, this model eliminates
the variables in other models, such as ethanol dose and
caloric intake that also impact NSCs (Geil et al., 2014;
Stangl and Thuret, 2009).
In terms of astrocytes, we observed regional and sex dif-
ferences in astrocytic responses following alcohol con-
sumption. The net changes of GFAP+ cells resulted from a
combination of NSC astrogliogenesis and astrocyte reacti-
vation, and varied among brain regions. Previous studies
evaluated regional and durational differences in GFAP
expression (Franke, 1995; Franke et al., 1997; Dalcik et al.,
2009); however, our study further examined both variables
together with sex differences in adult astrocyte response
to alcohol consumption. In addition, using the genetic
induced fate mapping technology, we were able to distin-
guish the newly NSC-differentiated astrocytes from the
reactivated astrocytes. Some studies reported increases in
GFAP immuno-labeled cells in the hippocampus following
alcohol consumption (Dalcik et al., 2009; Kane et al.,
2014). In contrast, we found no alteration of GFAP expres-
sion in males, but decreased GFAP in female hippocampal
dentate gyrus. Using a similar dosing paradigm, and in

similar GFAP responses (Franke, 1995; Franke et al.,
1997). These suggest that both ethanol dosing regimen
and sex play key roles in astrocytic responses.
Use of the transgenic fate tracing mice also enables more
accurate study of NSC population and differentiation.
In previous studies, bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) has been
used as a surrogate marker for proliferative NSCs. However,
because BrdU labels all proliferative cells, it is challenging
to distinguish proliferating NSCs from newly differentiated
DCX+ cells that are actively dividing (Klempin et al., 2011;
Kempermann et al., 2004; Taupin, 2007). Nevertheless, we
did observe decreased neurogenesis in response to chronic
alcohol consumption in SGZ and SVZ that is similar to
previous reports (Nixon and Crews, 2002; Herrera et al.,
2003; He et al., 2005; Crews et al., 2006; Hansson et al.,
2010; Golub et al., 2015).
One distinguishing aspect of our study is that using a
genetic inducible fate tracing mouse model enabled us to
identify three distinct phases contributing to neurogenesis
and evaluate the unique susceptibility of each phase to
ethanol. The three phases are NSCs (GFP+), newly differen-
tiated immature (GFP+DCX+) and mature (GFP+NeuN+)
neurons, and immature neurons (GFP�NeuN+) that were
present before tamoxifen induction. In the SVZ, we discov-
ered that NSCs lining the ventricle are most susceptible
to ethanol, followed by newly differentiated NSCs, and,
finally, cells that had differentiated before the onset of
the study. This subtle, yet important, distinction between
the stages of NSC differentiation is crucial in developing
an understanding of how ethanol progressively impacts
the adult brain. Furthermore, our data also suggested
the potential mechanisms underlying alcohol-induced
neurogenesis deficits in SVZ, including a reduced NSC
pool,
inhibition
of
neuronal
differentiation,
and/or
reduced migration of newly differentiated neurons. The
latter has also been well documented in rodents treated
with alcohol during neural development (Miller, 1993).
We found that NSCs lining the SVZ of the rostral lateral
ventricles were most susceptible to the effects of ethanol.
The significant reduction in the number of GFP+ NSCs,
and particularly the absence of GFP labeling in regions
lining the lateral ventricle, suggested cytotoxicity as a
mechanism. However, it is possible that inhibition of
proliferation also contributed to the reduction of GFP+
NSCs, which has been reported in previous studies (Golub
et al., 2015; Hansson et al., 2010; Nixon and Crews, 2002).
One explanation for this heightened effect is the proximity
of SVZ NSCs to the cerebrospinal fluid. It has previously
been shown that cerebrospinal fluid can directly influence
cell behavior and neurogenesis (Zappaterra and Lehtinen,
2012). Direct exposure to ethanol and other toxic metabo-
lites of ethanol, such as acetaldehyde, may contribute to
amplified sensitivity of this population. There was a robust
increase in GFAP+ cells in the region surrounding the SVZ
during a short-term ethanol treatment (our unpublished
data). One reason may be that the insult of ethanol and me-
tabolites on the SVZ initiates an injury response leading to
local astrocyte reactivation (Anderson et al., 2014; Brahma-
chari et al., 2006). The mechanism and extent to which
astrocyte reactivation contributes to changes in SVZ neuro-
genesis presents a unique opportunity for future studies.
On the other hand, a previous study did not detect signifi-
cant reduction of SVZ cell proliferation in the postmortem
brains of a small cohort of chronic alcoholic patients (Su-
therland et al., 2013). Although this needs to be further
confirmed with more human brains, it calls for animal
models of chronic alcohol abuse that more closely mimic
what occurs in humans.
The toxic effect of chronic ethanol intake on the SGZ
NSCs and neurogenesis appears to be less severe when
compared with the SVZ cells, in agreement with a vapor
ethanol administration model (Hansson et al., 2010).
Furthermore, we found a significant increase of NSCs in
the male SGZ after short-term ethanol treatment (our un-
published data). While this finding seems contradictory
to some previously published literature (Nixon and Crews,
2002; Crews et al., 2006; Morris et al., 2010; Campbell et al.,
2014), we believe that the discrepancies may be due to
different alcohol administration paradigms. On the other
hand, our finding is in agreement with those reported by
Pawlak et al. (2002), who also observed an increase in
NSC proliferation in the dentate gyrus following 14 days
of ethanol liquid diet consumption. In addition, moderate
ethanol consumption has also been shown to increase
adult NSC proliferation in the dentate gyrus (Aberg et al.,
2005). Further investigation into mechanisms for this
transient increase of NSCs in vivo is still needed; but
injury-induced NSC proliferation may be a likely mecha-
nism (Deierborg et al., 2010; Petrenko et al., 2015). The
less severe effect of long-term ethanol intake on the SGZ
NSCs indicates the potential of these cells to regain their
neurogenic function. Indeed, several studies demonstrated
a compensatory increase of SGZ NSC proliferation after
abstinence from binge drinking or chronic ethanol vapor
exposure (Nixon and Crews, 2004; Somkuwar et al.,
2016). Along this line, it remains to be determined what
amount of ethanol intake at what time period of exposure
would lead to irreversible damage to NSCs, which will most
likely depend on species, brain region, and sex.
The TL is an intriguing region, given its novelty in the
NSC field as well as its relationship with the surrounding
brain regions such as the dorsomedial hypothalamus,
paraventricular nucleus, and arcuate nucleus (Robins
et al., 2013; Haan et al., 2013; Rodriguez et al., 2005). Tany-
cytes are the primary cells found lining the TL of the third
1926
Stem Cell Reports j Vol. 9 j 1916–1930 j December 12, 2017
 ventricle, and their main function is to relay signals from
the CSF to the surrounding regions that are critical for regu-
lating functions such as feeding, sleep, and water balance
(Robins et al., 2013; Rodriguez et al., 2005). Robins et al.
(2013) showed that dorsal a-2 tanycytes present along
the third ventricle in the region of the arcuate nucleus
were unique in their possession of NSC-like potential.
However, in our study, we observed GFP+ cells in the a-1
tanycyte region as well. This suggests that a-1 tanycytes
may also have some NSC properties. Further studies should
be conducted to verify this finding.
While recent evidence has indicated that there may be
active adult neurogenesis in the TL (McNay et al., 2012;
Haan et al., 2013), we saw very little DCX+ staining and
no changes in response to ethanol consumption. In the
previous studies evaluating neurogenesis in this region,
neuronal marker NeuN was used, which may be one expla-
nation for the discrepant findings in our study (McNay
et al., 2012; Haan et al., 2013). NeuN labels more mature
neurons, whereas DCX labels immature migratory neurons.
Alternatively, the discrepancy in finding of TL neurogenesis
in hypothalamus may be attributed to different animal age,
i.e., 18-week-old mice in our study versus 8- to 12-week-old
mice in others (Rojczyk-Golebiewska et al., 2014). Further
investigation with multiple neuronal markers in animals
with a larger age range would be beneficial to elucidate
the presence and degree of neurogenesis in this region.
While we did not observe substantial neurogenesis,
the changes in NSCs and GFAP+ cells in the TL were quite
interesting. Long-term alcohol consumption resulted in a
decrease in NSCs, but not as dramatic of a decrease as was
observed in the SVZ. Since NSCs in the TL line the third
ventricle, we expected that their behavior would be similar
to NSCs in the SVZ of the lateral ventricle; however,
this was not observed in the present study. Increases of
GFAP+ cells were in females following alcohol consump-
tion. Given the role that tanycytes play in communication
with the hypothalamus and paraventricular nucleus in
regulation of feeding behavior and other endocrine-related
functions, further studies are necessary to better under-
stand the effect of alcohol on this cell population (Rodri-
guez et al., 2005). Since the morphology of the cells
in our study look similar to tanycytes, and that GFAP and
Nestin are expressed in tanycytes, further studies are needed
to fully validate the identity of this cell population.
Probably the most interesting finding from this work is
that regional location and sex played pivotal roles in deter-
mination of NSC response to ethanol consumption. Behav-
iorally, females showed more severe symptoms of intoxica-
tion over a shorter period of time compared with males.
Females also consumed more grams of ethanol per kilogram
of bodyweight. In the SVZ, females had a higher suscepti-
bility to the detrimental effects of ethanol consumption.
Their NSCs, DCX+ cell, and co-labeled newly differentiated
neurons were reduced significantly compared with males.
However, similar responses to ethanol were seen in the
SGZ in both males and females. In the TL, long-term con-
sumption initiated a greater increase in GFAP+ cells in
females compared with males. It is known, clinically, that
males and females have differing capacities to metabolize
ethanol (Oscar-Berman and Marinkovic, 2003). This may
be one possible explanation for the sex differences observed
in NSC response. If males and females produce varying
levels of ethanol metabolites, these metabolites could be
affecting the CNS more than males. In addition, it would
be of great value to further interrogate the role of the
endocrine system in NSC response to ethanol; especially
given the implication of the TL in NSC response to ethanol.
Altogether, our findings suggest that NSCs exhibit unique
behavior and susceptibility in response to ethanol, depend-
ing on the stage of differentiation, regional niche, duration
of ethanol consumption, and sex.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Animals
Nestin-CreERT2:R26R-YFP bitransgenic male and female mice were
generated by crossing the C57BL/6-Tg(Nes-cre/ERT2)KEisc/J strain
with the B6.129X1-Gt(ROSA)26Sortm1(EYFP)Cos/J strain (both
obtained from The Jackson Laboratory), and have been described
elsewhere (Lagace et al., 2007). Mice were genotyped by PCR using
genomic DNA from tail snip to confirm the presence of Cre and
YFP trans-genes (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures). All
animal experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee of the University of Texas Medical
Branch, and conducted in accordance with the Guide for the Care
and Use of Laboratory Animals, and maintained on a 12-hr light/
dark cycle.
Tamoxifen-Induced Recombination
Stock solutions of tamoxifen (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) were
prepared at 20 mg/mL in corn oil (Sigma). Mice, 8- to 10-weeks-
old, received intraperitoneal injections of 2 mg of tamoxifen
once a day for 5 consecutive days. A 3-week interval was left before
ethanol treatment to enable maximum recombination and
washout of immediate effects of tamoxifen. It has previously
been shown that tamoxifen treatment of these mice does not elicit
any sex-dependent effect on males or females (Lagace et al., 2007).
Ethanol Treatment
Mice, 12- to 14-weeks-old, were randomly assigned to either the
control (male n = 8, female n = 9) or experimental group (male
n = 13, female n = 12) using the ‘‘randomize’’ (RAND) function
in Microsoft Excel. Mice in each group were age and sex matched
to control for variability. Following randomization, mice were
given ad libitum access to water and a Lieber-DeCarli liquid diet
containing complete nutrients for rodents (Dyets, Bethlehem,
PA, catalog no. 710260), as described previously (Brandon-Warner
Stem Cell Reports j Vol. 9 j 1916–1930 j December 12, 2017
1927
 et al., 2012). Pair feeding was done, in which ethanol calories were
replaced by equivalent calories of maltose-dextrin in the diet for
control mice. The amount of ethanol in the liquid diet was slowly
increased from 1% to 4% over the course of 2 weeks. Mice in the
ethanol group were maintained on a 4% ethanol in the liquid
diet for up to 4 weeks. Both the control and ethanol-containing
liquid diets were made fresh daily. Each day, between 9:00 and
11:00 a.m., the feeding bottles were removed from the cage, the re-
maining liquid diet was measured and subtracted from the original
diet administered. All mice were euthanized between 8:00 and
11:00 a.m. See Supplemental Experimental Procedures for blood
alcohol and acetaldehyde analysis.
Home Cage Behavior Scoring
Mice were observed daily in home cages during exchange of liquid
diet tube. Behavior was recorded and scored on a 0- to 4-point scale
based on an ordinal scale (Figure 2A). 0 = control (asymptomatic)
behavior and 4 = severely impaired behavior. Mice that reached
level 4 or bodyweight reduction over 20% were terminated and
not used for the chronic group. Behavioral data were analyzed
using a random slope model.
Immunohistochemistry
At the termination of the experiments, mice were anesthetized
with ketamine/xylazine (90 and 10 mg/kg), and perfused with
cold 5 mL PBS and 30 mL of 4% paraformaldehyde via an intra-car-
dial injection. Mouse brains were collected, post-fixed in 4% para-
formaldehyde for 2 days at 4�C, and then infiltrated with 30%
sucrose for 5 days at 4�C before embedding in OCT medium. Tissue
was serially sectioned at a thickness of 30 mm using a Leica cryostat
machine. Detection of induced YPF was enhanced by immunohis-
tochemical staining with chicken anti-GFP antibodies (Aves Labs,
Tigard, OR, catalog no. GFP-1020). In addition, sections were
incubated with antibodies against GFAP (Thermo Fisher Scientific,
Waltham, MA, catalog no. PA110019), DCX (Abcam, San Fran-
cisco, CA, catalog no. ab18723), or NeuN (Thermo Fisher Scientific,
catalog no. MAB377). Following primary antibody incubation at
4�C overnight, sections were incubated with Alexa Fluor secondary
antibodies (goat-anti-chicken 488, catalog no. A11039; and goat-
anti-rabbit 568, catalog no. A11011).
Imaging and Cell Counting
All images were acquired on a Nikon D-ECLIPSE C1 confocal
microscope, using the Nikon EZ-C1 3.91 software. Blinded cell
counting was performed using NIS Elements software. Positive
identification of cells was based on both immunostaining and
morphological characteristics. The SVZ of the lateral ventricle
was counted from bregma 0.50 to 1.08, and both the SGZ of the
hippocampus and the TL of the third ventricle were counted
from bregma �1.58 to �2.16. Four sections (both hemispheres)
from each region, spanning a total of 580 mm longitudinally,
were counted for each antibody. Average total positive cells were
performed using triplicate mice for each region and antibody.
Statistics
The number of mice required for analysis was calculated based on
our previous results and power analyses using G*Power 3.1.7.
A number of 3 was needed to provide statistical significance at
p < 0.05 with a power of 0.80 for the histological data and an
n = 11 for behavioral analysis. A two-way ANOVA with various
post-hoc tests was used to analyze the alcohol intake-related data
and the immunohistochemical data, and multiple comparisons
were done with Tukey’s test, Holm-Sidak’s test, or Sidak’s test. All
statistical analyses were conducted using GraphPad Prism v.6 soft-
ware. Each group contained three mice per sex, and a p value less
than 0.05 was considered statistically significant, and a p value
greater than 0.05 but less than 0.1 was considered a trend. Behav-
ioral data were analyzed using a random intercept model by SAS9.4
(Snijders, 2011). Two-sided tests were conducted and a p value less
than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
