Abstract
Introduction
Low-calorie sweetener use for weight control has come under increasing scrutiny as obe-
sity, especially abdominal obesity, remain entrenched despite substantial low-calorie sweet-
ener use. We evaluated whether chronic low-calorie sweetener use is a risk factor for
abdominal obesity.
Participants and Methods
We used 8268 anthropometric measurements and 3096 food diary records with detailed
information on low-calorie sweetener consumption in all food products, from 1454 partici-
pants (741 men, 713 women) in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging collected from
1984 to 2012 with median follow-up of 10 years (range: 0–28 years). At baseline, 785 were
low-calorie sweetener non-users (51.7% men) and 669 participants were low-calorie sweet-
ener users (50.1% men). Time-varying low-calorie sweetener use was operationalized as
the proportion of visits since baseline at which low-calorie sweetener use was reported. We
used marginal structural models to determine the association between baseline and time-
varying low-calorie sweetener use with longitudinal outcomes—body mass index, waist cir-
cumference, obesity and abdominal obesity—with outcome status assessed at the visit fol-
lowing low-calorie sweetener ascertainment to minimize the potential for reverse causality.
All models were adjusted for year of visit, age, sex, age by sex interaction, race, current
smoking status, dietary intake (caffeine, fructose, protein, carbohydrate, and fat), physical
activity, diabetes status, and Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension score as
confounders.
Results
With median follow-up of 10 years, low-calorie sweetener users had 0.80 kg/m2 higher body
mass index (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.17–1.44), 2.6 cm larger waist circumference
(95% CI, 0.71–4.39), 36.7% higher prevalence (prevalence ratio = 1.37; 95% CI, 1.10–1.69)

Conclusions
Low-calorie sweetener use is independently associated with heavier relative weight, a larger
waist, and a higher prevalence and incidence of abdominal obesity suggesting that low-calo-
rie sweetener use may not be an effective means of weight control.
Introduction
The worldwide onset of obesity over the previous 3 decades shows no sign of slowing with one
billion adults projected to have obesity by 2025 [1]. In the United States, the dramatic increase
in obesity measured by body mass index (BMI) has recently plateaued at 35% for men but con-
tinued to increase to 40% for women [2]. Similar trend was noted in the 60 years and older
group [2]. The prevalence of abdominal obesity measured by waist circumference (WC) con-
tinues to rise in the US for both men and women, however [3]. Obesity and abdominal obesity
in particular, are well-established risk factors for a host of medical conditions including diabe-
tes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease [4, 5]. Low-calorie sweetener use has long been
recommended as a dietary strategy to reduce carbohydrate and total energy intake for weight
and diabetes management [6, 7]. However, despite substantial increased low-calorie sweetener
consumption after their introduction in the market, often in the form of diet soda, obesity
remains entrenched [8, 9].
Consequently, the effectiveness of using low-calorie sweeteners for weight reduction and
control has faced increasing scrutiny and remained controversial. Over the years, results from
randomized controlled trials of low-calorie sweeteners for weight loss have been inconsistent
[6, 10–18]. Findings from some observational studies suggest diet soda consumption may even
increase risk of obesity, metabolic syndrome, and diabetes [19–26]. Recent studies suggested
that these risks may be modified by dietary quality [27–29]. Nevertheless, findings have not
been entirely uniform due to differences in how low-calorie sweetener consumption was
assessed or in analytical models used. To clarify and expand on the potential consequences of
low-calorie sweetener use, we evaluated up to 28 years of longitudinal data on diet and body
composition collected in participants in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA).
Materials and Methods
Study Population
The BLSA is an ongoing observational continuous-enrollment cohort study of normative
aging in adults established in 1958 and currently conducted by the National Institute on Aging
[30]. The BLSA participants are adult volunteers aged 20 years and older, recruited from the
community and healthy at study entry. They undergo medical, physiological, and psychologi-
cal examinations at age-specific visit intervals and return for follow-up visits for life. All partic-
ipants provide written informed consent at each visit. The BLSA protocol has been approved
by the Intramural Research Program of the US National Institute on Aging and the Institu-
tional Review Board of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences.
The study sample includes 1454 men and women with at least one BLSA visit that included
anthropometric measures and complete dietary record data beginning in 1984 when dietary

 records were first collected in both sexes. For each participant, the first visit, not necessary
their visit at study entry, which included complete dietary record data and anthropometric
measures was defined as the baseline visit. These 1454 participants contributed a total of 8268
person-visits of follow-up through 2012, with median follow-up of 10 years (range: 0–28
years).
Measures
Anthropometric Measures. Height was measured in centimeters to the nearest one milli-
meter using a stadiometer; weight was measured in kilograms to the nearest 10th of a kilogram;
WC was measured in centimeters to the nearest one millimeter just below the rib cage where
the waist tapers. BMI was defined as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared.
Two different measures of adiposity were used: obesity defined as BMI � 30 kg/m2; and
abdominal obesity, an indicator of visceral fat deposition, defined as WC > 102cm for men
and > 88cm for women [5, 31].
Assessment of Low-Calorie Sweetener Use. Dietary intake was assessed using a 7-day
dietary record. The details of dietary collection and analyses have been described previously
[32]. Diet data were collected at some visits from 1984 to 2008. Participants did not complete a
dietary record at every visit to reduce participant burden, and all available dietary records were
used. Low-calorie sweetener consumption was noted when consumption of food or drink con-
taining low-calorie sweetener (aspartame, saccharin, acesulfame potassium, or sucralose) was
recorded in the dietary record. This collection method identified low-calorie sweeteners found
in all food products, not just diet soda.
Covariates.
Covariates encompass socio-demographic factors including age, sex, age by
sex interaction and race; behavioral factors known to impact weight such as physical activity
(sedentary, low, moderate or high based on reported frequency and duration of vigorous and
moderate physical activity) and smoking status (current smoker versus former and never
smoker); dietary intake of specific nutrients (caffeine, fructose, protein, carbohydrate, and fat);
and diet quality using the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score. DASH
score derived from consumption of total fat, saturated fat, protein, fiber, cholesterol, calcium,
magnesium and potassium and which ranges from 0 to 9 with higher values signifying higher
quality diet [33]. Year of visit and diabetes status determined from an oral glucose tolerance
test (OGTT) and categorized as no, yes and pre-diabetes were accounted for in the analyses.
Statistical Analysis
Associations between baseline low-calorie sweetener use and participant characteristics were
assessed using chi-square tests for categorical variables and t-tests or Wilcoxon rank-sum tests
for continuous variables. Associations between baseline low-calorie sweetener use and charac-
teristics measured over all person-visits were assessed using unadjusted generalized estimating
equations with robust standard errors [34].
Marginal Structural Models.
We used marginal structural models to determine the asso-
ciations of low-calorie sweetener use history with study endpoints while accounting for time-
independent and time-varying covariates. Similarly, we used marginal structural Cox propor-
tional hazards models to determine the association of low-calorie sweetener use history with
onset of obesity-related outcomes. Unlike conventional longitudinal analysis and Cox propor-
tional hazards models, marginal structural models and marginal structural Cox proportional
hazards models adjust for time-varying confounding using inverse probability of exposure
weights rather than by including confounders in the regression model. The rationale for using
marginal structural models and marginal structural Cox proportional hazards models in the

 current project is to appropriately account for time-varying confounding of an exposure his-
tory. Specifically, at each visit v for each participant, we operationalized low-calorie sweetener
use history as the proportion of past visits (0 through v-1) in which the participant reported
using low-calorie sweeteners. Thus, it is important to control for BMI (and other factors) at
visits 0 through v-1 that may influence both the choice to use low-calorie sweeteners over time
and the study outcome at visit v. However, if we were to include past BMI as a covariate as one
would do in a conventional regression model, we would obtain biased results because we
would be adjusting for a factor that may be in the causal pathway; but if we did not adjust for
BMI, we would obtain biased results confounded by past BMI. The inverse probability weights
allow us to overcome this catch-22 by adjusting for past BMI (and other factors) via standardi-
zation (i.e., the weights) rather than conditioning in a regression model. Marginal structural
models and marginal structural Cox proportional hazards models can also be used to compute
standardized associations of a baseline-measured exposure with study outcomes, as described
in detail in Fig 1.
Baseline Low-calorie Sweetener Use.
We used marginal structural models to determine
the association between baseline low-calorie sweetener use and longitudinal outcomes [35].
Model 1 included visits after baseline as outcome visits and adjusted for baseline values of out-
comes as confounders to minimize the potential of reverse causality. Additionally, Model 1
was adjusted for covariates. Inverse-probability weighting was used to account for confound-
ers, study drop-out, and truncation by death [35, 36]. Specifically, inverse probability weights
for low-calorie sweetener use, to adjust for confounders, were computed as the inverse of prob-
abilities estimated using a logistic regression of low-calorie sweetener use on covariates.
Inverse-probability weights for study drop-out were computed as the inverse of products of
probabilities estimated using pooled logistic regression that included time-varying confound-
ing factors, visit number and time between visits. This model included participants whose last
study visit occurred before 2012 and who were not confirmed deceased by 2012. The weight
used in analysis was the reciprocal of 1-probability of drop-out. Lastly, inverse-probability
weights for death were computed as the inverse of products of probabilities of survival esti-
mated using a Cox proportional hazards model that included time-varying confounding fac-
tors, visit number and time between visits. The weight used in analysis was the reciprocal of
1-probability of death. Intuitively, the product of 1-probability of death and 1-probability of
drop-out can be interpreted as the probability of being alive and participating in the study.
This weight helps to overcome selection bias due to death and drop-out. As a sensitivity analy-
sis, we also included time (years from baseline)-by-low-calorie sweetener interactions to deter-
mine whether differences emerge early or later.
Fig 1. Schema for Marginal Structural Models. Adjusting for BMI at visit v-1 by including this term in the
regression model would lead to bias because it is potentially in the causal pathway from low-calorie sweetener
(LCS) use at visit v-2 to the study outcome (BMI at visit v here). However, failing to adjust for BMI at visit v-1
would lead to bias because it confounds the relation of LCS at visit v-1 with BMI at visit v. Marginal structural
models overcome this problem by using inverse probability weights to adjust for confounders.

 Cumulative incidence of obesity and abdominal obesity were also estimated and com-
pared by baseline low-calorie sweetener use while accounting for the competing risk of
death [37, 38]. Inverse-probability weights for baseline low-calorie sweetener use, study
drop-out, and mortality were also used in a marginal structural Cox proportional hazards
model to assess the associations of baseline low-calorie sweetener use with incident obesity
and abdominal obesity [39].
Time-Varying Low-calorie Sweetener Use.
Low-calorie sweetener use by participants
fluctuated over time; therefore, we used marginal structural models to assess the relation of
time-varying low-calorie sweetener use with longitudinal outcomes [35]. In Model 2, time-
varying low-calorie sweetener use was operationalized as the proportion of visits since base-
line at which low-calorie sweetener was used to summarize low-calorie sweetener use his-
tory. Inverse-probability weights for drop-out and mortality were computed as previously
described; however, the covariates were also time-varying and included outcome measures
assessed at previous visits [35, 36]. Inverse-probability weights for time-varying low-calorie
sweetener use were computed using pooled logistic regression of low-calorie sweetener on
year of visit, visit number, age, sex, age-by-sex interaction, race, current smoking status, val-
ues of time-varying dietary intake (caffeine, fructose, protein, carbohydrate, and fat)
assessed at the same visit as low-calorie sweetener use, physical activity, diabetes status (no,
yes, pre-diabetics), DASH score, and lagged (previous visit) low-calorie sweetener use,
lagged outcomes, lagged diabetes status, and 2- and 3-way interactions between lagged low-
calorie sweetener use, lagged diabetes status, sex, and time since previous visit as confound-
ers. In other words, an outcome assessed at visit v was regressed on low-calorie sweetener
history up to the visit prior to outcome assessment to rule out reverse causality. In Model 2,
outcomes at visit v were regressed on low-calorie sweetener use history through visit v-1,
hence minimizing reverse causality. Model 2 did not include outcomes assessed at baseline
and adjusted for covariates. We additionally fit a marginal structural Cox proportional haz-
ards model relating time-varying low-calorie sweetener use to incidence of obesity and
abdominal obesity using the weights from Model 2. SAS version 9.2 and R version 3.1.1
were used for all analyses. P-value <0.05 was considered statistically significant for all
analyses.
Results
Baseline Characteristics
At baseline, low-calorie sweetener users compared to non-users were on average 2 years youn-
ger, 59.5 ±15.8 years versus 61.8 ±15.8 years, respectively. Low-calorie sweetener users also had
higher BMI, 26.4 ± 4.5 kg/m2 compared to 25.3 ± 4.0 kg/m2, as well as higher WC, 88.1 ±13.2
cm compared to 86.2 ± 12.0 cm. In addition, the low-calorie sweetener users had higher preva-
lence of obesity, abdominal obesity and type 2 diabetes (Table 1). Low-calorie sweetener use
was not associated with differential total caloric intake, dietary macronutrient composition,
physical activity level or smoking, but users consumed lower amounts of fructose and higher
amounts of caffeine than non-users, but had similar diet quality. Median number of visits did
not differ, but low-calorie sweetener users had a slightly longer follow-up than non-users (10.4
vs. 8.8 years).
During the study period (1984–2012), the 1454 participants contributed 3096 food diary
records with 92 unique low-calorie sweetener use histories which were classified into 19 pat-
terns defined by length and number and type of transition (S1 Table). Fifty-three percent of
participants contributed a food diary at more than one visit. Of the 785 participants classified
as low-calorie sweetener non-users at baseline, 628 (80%) did not report low-calorie sweetener

 use at any contributed food diary; of the 669 participants classified as low-calorie sweetener
users at baseline, 521 (78%) reported low-calorie sweetener use at all contributed food diaries;
and the remaining 305 participants (21%) switched between using and not using low-calorie
sweetener during the observation period with 72 (5%) switching more than twice between sta-
tuses. A heat-map illustrates the patterns of low-calorie sweetener consumption over time (S1
Fig).

 Low-Calorie Sweetener Use and Body Size Changes
Participants who always reported using low-calorie sweetener had higher average BMI and
WC (Table 2), and a higher prevalence of abdominal obesity than participants who never
reported using low-calorie sweetener (Table 3). Even when low-calorie sweetener use history
was examined in relation to obesity outcomes assessed at the subsequent follow-up visit to
minimize reverse causality, always users had on average 0.80 kg/m2 higher BMI (95% confi-
dence interval [CI], 0.17, 1.44; P = 0.01) and 2.6 cm larger WC (95% CI, 0.71, 4.39; P = 0.007)
after controlling for covariates and accounting for study drop-out and truncation by death.
Similarly, compared to never users, always users had 36.7% higher prevalence of abdominal

 obesity (Prevalence Ratio [PR] = 1.367; 95% CI, 1.104, 1.693; P = 0.004). The prevalence of
obesity did not significantly differ according to low-calorie sweetener use history. These find-
ings are consistent with those based on baseline low-calorie sweetener use.
In a sensitivity analysis that included time-by-baseline low-calorie sweetener use interac-
tions, low-calorie sweetener users had higher BMI and WC at baseline; and greater adjusted
increases over time in WC but not BMI, compared to non-users (Fig 2). The prevalence of
abdominal obesity was higher at baseline among users than non-users and the difference did
not change over time whereas the prevalence of obesity between the two groups did not differ
at baseline or change over time (Fig 2).

 Low-Calorie Sweetener Use and Onset of Obesity and Abdominal
Obesity
Participants who reported low-calorie sweetener use and did not have obesity at baseline had a
significantly greater cumulative incidence of obesity (P<0.001) than participants who did not
report baseline low-calorie sweetener use (Fig 3A). Similarly, compared to low-calorie sweet-
ener non-users, users with no abdominal obesity at baseline also had a significantly higher
cumulative incidence of abdominal obesity (Fig 2B). These findings were essentially confirmed
after adjustment for covariates and accounting for study drop-out and truncation by death
(Table 4). Assessing time-varying low-calorie sweetener use, always users had a marginally
higher adjusted hazard of obesity (Hazard Ratio [HR] = 1.60; 95% CI 0.96, 2.64; P = 0.07) and
a significantly higher adjusted hazard of abdominal obesity (HR = 1.53; 95% CI 1.10, 2.12;
P = 0.012) than never users (Table 4).
Discussion
In a community volunteer cohort study of 1454 men and women with 8268 person-visits over
28 years, low-calorie sweetener use was associated with heavier weight, a larger waist, and a
higher prevalence and incidence of abdominal obesity—even after accounting for diet quality
and weight and body size at the time of low-calorie sweetener use assessment, which may drive
the decision to consume low-calorie sweetener. These data suggest that low-calorie sweetener
consumption may deleteriously affect visceral fat deposition, a strong risk factor for cardiovas-
cular disease and mortality.
Although the hypothesis that consuming low-calorie sweeteners contributes to increased
weight and fatness has been previously investigated [19, 21, 23, 27–29], the current study takes
advantage of the extensive data collected in the BLSA with up to 28 years of longitudinal obser-
vations on body composition and low-calorie sweetener consumption found in all food prod-
ucts, not just diet soda. Further, two different measures of adiposity—obesity by BMI and
abdominal obesity by WC—all showed chronic low-calorie sweeteners consumption was asso-
ciated with increasing obesity, most noticeably abdominal obesity. These findings have impor-
tant public health implication since the prevalence of abdominal obesity in the US continues
to rise. Our finding of low-calorie sweetener use and weight gain is consistent with results
from two longitudinal studies, with six to nine years of follow-up, reporting an association
between consumption of low-calorie sweetener containing beverages and increased weight
gain [19, 23]. The finding of increase in waist circumference with low-calorie sweetener use is
consistent with prior work on the association between diet soda with increased waist circum-
ference [21, 23]. In our study, the extensive longitudinal information allowed us to account for
time-varying low-calorie sweetener use and thereby strengthen the evidence of a potential
causal relationship.
Recent longitudinal studies suggest that risk of increased waist circumference and other
cardiometabolic outcomes associated with low-calorie sweeteners may be modified by dietary
quality [27–29]. Specifically, non-users of diet soda have smaller waistline than users regardless
of diet quality and furthermore, individuals who consume a “western” diet with diet soda have
significantly larger waistline compared to individuals on “prudent” diet with no diet soda [29].
In our analyses, taking dietary quality into account further strengthen the association between
low-calorie sweetener use and risk of gaining weight, increasing waistline, and incidence and
prevalence of abdominal obesity (results not shown). This finding suggests that diet quality
may be a negative confounder in the association between low-calorie sweetener use and
obesity.

 Over the years, controlled intervention trials of 10 weeks to 12 months duration, have
reported that low-calorie sweetener beverages results in modest weight loss or has a negligible
effect [10–17]. Substituting low-calorie beverages for sugar-sweetened beverages can decrease
energy intake, but evidence of their effectiveness for weight management is limited. Low-calo-
rie sweeteners certainly have fewer calories; however, our study suggests that they may have
metabolic activity that is pro-obesogenic—especially for abdominal adiposity—and this
hypothesis should be actively researched.
Mechanisms for the association between low-calorie sweetener use and progressively rising
prevalence of abdominal obesity remain unknown. One potential explanation derives from the
physiology of the brain food reward system. Evidence from animal studies demonstrates that
dopamine signaling in the brain may function as a “central caloric sensor” that regulates nutri-
ent intake accounting for the caloric density of food [40]. Low-calorie sweeteners used as a
sugar alternative may reduce food specific calories, but because they do not produce satiety,
they can encourage more eating. Ageusic mice, lacking sweet taste sensation due to mutation
in the taste ion channel TRPM5, acquire preference for sucrose and show robust dopamine
release with sucrose but not with low-calorie sweetener ingestion [41]. This finding exemplifies
the hypothesis that the reward system in the brain normally links “sweetness” with absorption
of calories in the gut. Low-calorie sweeteners, with no caloric density, actually may cause the
brain to abandon sweetness as a calorie gauge. Therefore, individuals who consume low-calo-
rie sweeteners may compensate by over-eating in order to experience the expected satiety.
Another possible mechanism may involve the gut microbiome. Evidence from a rodent study
indicates that chronic saccharin consumption contributes to weight gain and worsening glu-
cose tolerance by inducing dysbiosis and altering the composition and function of intestinal
microbiota. The altered microbiota exhibit enhanced energy harvest pathways previously asso-
ciated with obesity in mice and humans. These mice also had altered bacterial taxa similar to
those found associated with type 2 diabetes in humans [42, 43]. Other low-calorie sweeteners
such as sucralose has also been shown to contribute to weight gain and altered intestinal
microbiota in rats [44]. Low-dose aspartame, however, was associated with altered intestinal
microbiota with worsening glucose tolerance but less weight gain in rats when challenged with
high fat diet [45]. The underlying mechanism is unknown and warrants further investigation.
The strengths of our study include the follow-up period of up to 28 years and the use of
7-day food diaries at multiple follow-up visits. The food diary provides details of low-calorie
sweetener use in all food products including coffee, tea, and dessert, which allow for a more
comprehensive assessment of low-calorie sweetener consumption beyond diet soda. Previous

 studies assessed diet soda consumption using food frequency questionnaires with participant
assessment done at study centers [19–24] or using mailed questionnaires [25, 26]. In addition,
we took into consideration diet quality using the DASH score. Lastly, since we accounted for
body composition at the time of assessment of low-calorie sweetener use, the possibility that
risk of weight gain largely explains the observed associations between low-calorie sweetener
use and forms of obesity is minimized.
Using different models and approaches to account for initial “indication” and changing
usage patterns, we consistently found low-calorie sweetener use associated with weight gain
and expanding waistline. Nevertheless, several limitations should be considered in interpreting
the findings. First, BLSA is an observation study, therefore we cannot rule out the possibility of
unmeasured confounders. However, we mitigated this possibility by including many relevant
covariates and by analytically accounting for other factors. For example, we modeled visits
after low-calorie sweetener assessment to minimize reverse causality and modeled the drop-
out and mortality process to reduce bias from missing data. We also took into account dietary
quality as a potential confounder. Second, the BLSA cohort is, in general, a highly motivated
and health conscious group of individuals; for example, only 17% of the cohort developed obe-
sity over the follow-up period, compared to the US adult population with obesity prevalence of
38% in 2014 [2]. However, this limitation can also be considered a study strength in that
weight gain and increasing waistline were demonstrated with low-calorie sweetener consump-
tion even in this highly motivated cohort. Third, low-calorie sweetener use is represented as a
dichotomous variable (yes or no), thus we do not have a more granular measure of low-calorie
intake and our estimates are likely conservative. Finally, the BLSA cohort are older with base-
line age of about 60 years; therefore, the results may be subject to survival bias and may not be
generalizable to younger adults. To mitigate the degree of bias, we used inverse probability of
survival weights in our models to account for factors that may jointly impact study outcomes
and mortality.
Our finding has important public health implications. These findings underscore that
weight management strategies should be rooted in understanding how the human body
responds to certain types of food instead of merely considering the theoretical caloric content.
Independent of caloric content, the specific food eaten affects subsequent eating behavior,
influences intestinal microbiota that contributes to energy handling and interacts with enter-
oendocrine and neuroendocrine pathways, all mechanisms which ultimately affect energy
homeostasis. Through these mechanisms, low-calorie sweetener use may be a contributor to
the obesity epidemic.
