Echocardiography as a guide for fluid
management

Abstract
Background: In critically ill patients at risk for organ failure, the administration of intravenous fluids has equal
chances of resulting in benefit or harm. While the intent of intravenous fluid is to increase cardiac output and
oxygen delivery, unwelcome results in those patients who do not increase their cardiac output are tissue edema,
hypoxemia, and excess mortality. Here we briefly review bedside methods to assess fluid responsiveness, focusing
upon the strengths and pitfalls of echocardiography in spontaneously breathing mechanically ventilated patients as
a means to guide fluid management. We also provide new data to help clinicians anticipate bedside
echocardiography findings in vasopressor-dependent, volume-resuscitated patients.
Objective: To review bedside ultrasound as a method to judge whether additional intravenous fluid will increase
cardiac output. Special emphasis is placed on the respiratory effort of the patient.
Conclusions: Point-of-care echocardiography has the unique ability to screen for unexpected structural findings while
providing a quantifiable probability of a patient’s cardiovascular response to fluids. Measuring changes in stroke volume
in response to either passive leg raising or changes in thoracic pressure during controlled mechanical ventilation offer
good performance characteristics but may be limited by operator skill, arrhythmia, and open lung ventilation strategies.
Measuring changes in vena caval diameter induced by controlled mechanical ventilation demands less training of the
operator and performs well during arrythmia. In modern delivery of critical care, however, most patients are nursed
awake, even during mechanical ventilation. In patients making respiratory efforts we suggest that ventilator settings
must be standardized before assessing this promising technology as a guide for fluid management.

Background
A routine but challenging task facing acute care physi-
cians is to identify and treat patients at risk for acute
organ failure as a result of inadequate systemic perfusion
and oxygen delivery. The decision to administer supple-
mental intravenous fluids to the patient at risk is built
upon the belief that additional volume expansion will, or
will not, increase cardiac output. Although there are
many unknowns in a critically ill patient, fundamental
cardiovascular physiology represents a touchstone from
which decisions can be made.
One important premise is that during the time it takes to
administer bolus intravenous fluid, one can assume a con-
stant cardiac contractility. Changes in stroke volume in re-
sponse
to
intravenous
fluids
are
therefore
mainly
determined by changes in ventricular end-diastolic volume.
At constant cardiac contractility, the relationship between
stroke volume and ventricular end-diastolic volume has
been classically described by Patterson and Starling [1],
Sarnoff and colleagues [2–5], and Guyton and Coleman [6].
At low ventricular end-diastolic volume, the stroke volume
increases briskly with administration of intravenous fluids.
This immediately increases both cardiac output and oxygen
delivery. Unfortunately, once the patient reaches their plat-
eau ventricular end-diastolic volume, further increasing
preload with intravenous fluids will not improve car-
diac output and has been shown to result in clinical
harm [7–13]. It is therefore critical that the clinician
uses
the
best
means
at
their
disposal
to
judge

 whether additional intravenous fluids will result in
benefit (increased cardiac output, oxygen delivery, and
ultimate reversal of impending organ failure) [14] or
harm (tissue edema, hypoxemia, and excess mortality).
While the clinical effect of fluids in a given patient
will be determined through careful examination and a
number of parameters such as reduction in lactate,
urine output, and level of consciousness, in the fol-
lowing sections when we refer to the presence of
“fluid responsiveness” we refer to a measurable in-
crease of 15 % in cardiac output.
Is the patient on the steep portion of the Starling
curve?
Clinical prediction of fluid responsiveness was first
studied using single measurements of cardiac filling
volumes (preload). These include the direct measure-
ment of right atrial pressure as a surrogate of volume,
also referred to as central venous pressure (CVP) and
less
commonly
as
the
pulmonary
capillary
wedge
pressure, which in ideal situations is synonymous with
left atrial pressure as a surrogate of left ventricular
end-diastolic
volume.
As
has
been
extensively
reviewed elsewhere, static measures of preload per-
form no better than chance in patients who are critic-
ally ill. It is now recognized that bedside maneuvers
which rapidly change preload are more discriminative
than static measures. Currently, passive leg raising
(PLR) and respiratory variation in thoracic pressure
are the two techniques used to vary preload. Within
1 minute of bilateral PLR, there is an effective in-
crease
in
preload
through
recruitment
of
blood
pooled in the legs [15]. In the patient not on vaso-
pressors, an increase in blood pressure suggests that
the patient will respond to a fluid bolus, whereas in
those on vasoactive medications there is no detectable
change in blood pressure and the output of interest is
change in cardiac output. This technique is therefore
best suited to patients who are not yet on vasopres-
sors, with normal intrathoracic pressures (mechanic-
ally ventilated patients often fail to augment their
preload as definitely), and those without significant
abdominal pathology.
Variation in intrathoracic pressure during tidal breathing
is the other cause of varied right or left cardiac preload. It
is important to recognize that the type of respiration (spon-
taneous versus controlled) will determine the resultant
physiology. In mechanically ventilated patients with no re-
spiratory effort, the positive inspiratory pressure transfers
blood from the lungs to the left heart, resulting in an in-
crease in stroke volume. This is seen as a rapid increase in
pulse pressure. At high levels of positive intrathoracic pres-
sure one can also decrease the venous return, and after
transit of this reduced blood volume from the right to left
heart there can be a decline in pulse pressure. The larger
the fluctuations in pulse pressure as a result of respiration,
the greater the chance that the patient will increase cardiac
output in response to fluid. This method cannot be used
during arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation or with very
rapid heart rates.
Respiratory changes in intrathoracic pressure also
occur in the dimensions of both the inferior and super-
ior vena cavae. These changes also depend on the degree
of intrathoracic pressure change and on the compliance
of the vena cavae. Positive intrathoracic pressure in-
creases the size of the inferior vena cava (IVC), while
negative intrathoracic breaths reduce its size. When the
vena cava is distended, the compliance markedly re-
duces. A large, nonfluctuant IVC therefore suggests that
the patient is not on the steep (volume responsive) por-
tion of the Starling curve. The IVC diameter is easily
and reproducibly measured 1–2 cm from the right atrial
junction using transthoracic ultrasound [16–21].
The patient following initial resuscitation
Venous return, central venous pressure, and cardiac out-
put are tightly coregulated as described by Patterson and
Starling [1], Sarnoff and colleagues [2–5], and Guyton
and Coleman [6]. Highly predictable under normal cir-
cumstances,
the
ability
to
increase
cardiac
output
through augmentations in venous return and central
venous pressure changes dramatically in the patient who
develops shock refractory to intravenous fluids. In 2016,
standardized protocols dictate that following the recog-
nition of nonhemorrhagic shock the patient will rapidly
receive at least 20 ml/kg fluid [22]. Fifty percent of
patients [23] do not achieve adequate perfusion with
modest volume expansion and thus require vasopressors
to maintain circulatory tone. In these patients, intraven-
ous volume expansion during the first 6–12 hours fol-
lowing admission increases dramatically to 50–70 ml/kg
[23, 24]. Norepinephrine, the vasopressor of choice in
most circumstances [25], will not only increase arterial
blood pressure through increased systemic vascular re-
sistance but has a significant effect upon capacitance
vessels, both arterial and venous, resulting in effective
fluid loading to the right heart [26]. It is evident that in-
fusion of an entire blood volume of new fluid into the
circulation, along with recruitment of circulatory capaci-
tance, results in an extreme change to venous return,
central venous pressure, and cardiac output.
In addition to the direct influence of the cardiovascu-
lar system, cardiopulmonary interactions play a crucial
role in establishing the equilibrium of venous return,
central venous pressure, and cardiac output. This is
because 70–90 % of patients with shock require mechan-
ical ventilation [25, 27]. In the early phase of resuscita-
tion during which patients are sedated to facilitate
Boyd et al. Critical Care  (2016) 20:274 
Page 2 of 7
 investigations and treatment, mean airway pressures of
up to 24 cmH2O/18 mmHg [28] have significant but un-
predictable effects. These high thoracic pressures cause
a decline in venous return and/or a functional unloading
of the left ventricle through pressurization of the heart
and thoracic aorta.
What can the clinician expect to find on clinical
examination and echocardiography following
initial volume resuscitation?
Central venous pressure in health is tightly governed at 0–
5 mmHg [1–6], resulting in an IVC diameter of 13–21 mm
when supine, and a collapse of more than 50 % upon quiet
inspiration [16, 17, 19]. In patients who have received the
current aggressive early volume expansion we know the
newly established value for central venous pressure will be
9–15 mmHg [12, 24]. This change in venous pressure is
highly influential upon the vena caval diameter as measured
by
transthoracic
echocardiography.
In
our
recently
published study into the utility of ultrasound following vol-
ume expansion to guide therapy in nonhemorrhagic shock
[14] we went back to review the impact of 30 ml/kg intra-
venous fluid resuscitation upon the IVC diameter and fluc-
tuation. In 110 subjects the IVC diameter following
intravenous volume expansion was increased by 35 % from
normal values to 17–29 mm. Furthermore, in nearly half
(45 %) of the patients there was no variation in diameter ac-
cording to respiration. In a further 20 % of patients there
was >0 but <15 % variability (the median cutoff point of
IVC collapse which defines fluid responsiveness). This in-
formation may be of utility for the clinician without access
to ultrasound, who may choose to restrict further fluids
based upon a pretest probability of 0.65 that their fluid-
resuscitated patient on vasopressors will not augment car-
diac output as a result of further fluids.
Summary of what the clinician can expect when
using central venous pressure and ultrasound to
guide fluid therapy in the ventilated critically ill
patient following resuscitation for shock
1. A central venous pressure of 9–15 mmHg.
2. Maximum IVC diameter of 17–29 mmHg
3. According to the increase in IVC diameter upon
mandated inspiration, 2/3 patients will be deemed
nonresponsive to fluid.
Clinical methods at the bedside to assess volume
response
Using ultrasound to monitor stroke volume while
performing the passive leg raising maneuver
Passive leg raising (PLR) is one of the most versatile
techniques to assess fluid needs in ICU patients.
PLR
can
be
performed
at
the
bedside
in
both
mechanically
ventilated
patients
and
in
spontan-
eously breathing patients [15, 29–31]. Meta-analysis
of 23 studies with a combined total of 1013 patients
from a wide range of clinical settings demonstrated
that the global predictive value of PLR was strong.
The test performed very well with a pooled sensitiv-
ity of 86 %, specificity of 92 %, and a summary
AUROC of 0.95 [30]. In another meta-analysis, 21
studies were analyzed and the pooled correlation be-
tween
the
PLR-induced
versus
fluid-induced
in-
creases
in
cardiac
output
was
0.76.
The
pooled
sensitivity was 0.85, the pooled specificity was 0.91,
and the pooled AUROC was 0.95 [15]. This maneu-
ver is easy to perform at the bedside. The patient is
placed in a semirecumbent position with the head of
the bed 30–45° above the horizontal. The maneuver
consists of rapidly moving the bed to simultaneously
elevate the lower limbs to 30–45° above the horizon-
tal while lowering the head of the bed to 0o (supine).
This maneuver transfers blood from the legs and the
splanchnic reservoir to the intrathoracic compart-
ment, rapidly increasing the preload, thereby testing
the preload dependency of the heart. Using PLR,
250–350 ml of blood is transferred from the legs to
the heart and this method is entirely reversible [30].
It is essential that this maneuver should be done
from the semirecumbent position because this in-
creases the blood shift and accentuates the change
in cardiac output compared with a supine start [32].
Cardiac output changes can be detected 1–2 minutes
after the PLR maneuver using echocardiography [31].
It is useful to note that there is a close correlation
between the changes in cardiac output or stroke vol-
ume induced by the PLR and that achieved through
equivalent intravenous volume expansion. In other
words, the change is not simply a threshold effect,
and the greater the increases in cardiac output and
stroke volume during PLR, the greater will be the
increase
in
these
parameters
after fluid
infusion.
Arrhythmia should have no effect on the diagnostic
performance because the effect of PLR is measured
over multiple heartbeats and multiple breaths, likely
nullifying potential distorting effects of arrhythmia
and spontaneous breathing, respectively [30], but this
has yet to be confirmed by a large prospective study
in
this
population.
The
PLR
maneuver
seems
inaccurate in patients with very significant intra-
abdominal hypertension, as demonstrated by Mahjoub
et al. [33].
Advantages of the passive leg raising maneuver
1. PLR can be performed regardless of arrhythmia or
mode of ventilation.
Boyd et al. Critical Care  (2016) 20:274 
Page 3 of 7
 2. The PLR is not simply “positive” versus “negative”;
the degree of increase in stroke volume to PLR
predicts the increase in these parameters to fluids.
Disadvantages of the passive leg raising maneuver
1. The interobserver and intraobserver reliability of
measurements in cardiac output is highly operator
dependent. A skilled operator is required to achieve
high-quality measures of aortic blood flow.
Using ultrasound to monitor stroke volume while
receiving controlled mechanical ventilation
Aortic flow variations during mechanical ventilation
may be a superior measure of what is observed clinic-
ally as stroke volume variation (SVV), a parameter
correlated with fluid responsiveness [34]. Feissel et al.
[35] assessed the variation of the maximal velocity
during the respiratory cycle and found that variation
greater than 12 % accurately predicted fluid respon-
siveness of ICU patients. The aortic blood flow is re-
corded from an apical five-chamber view using pulsed
Doppler imaging. Aortic blood flow variation shares
the
same
limitations
as
pulse
pressure
variation.
These two parameters may be used only in patients
without arrhythmia and seem invalid in patients with
right ventricular dilation or dysfunction [36]. The
pathophysiology of these parameters is based on the
effects of mechanical ventilation, which induces trans-
pulmonary and intrathoracic pressure change. The
magnitude of these effects depends mainly on the
transmission
of
airway
pressure
variations
to
the
heart. Open chest conditions therefore make all of
these parameters invalid to assess fluid need. Simi-
larly, protective mechanical ventilation (in which a
low tidal volume is used to decrease the plateau pres-
sure and driving pressure) is now widely used for
ARDS patients, in whom the low tidal volume de-
creases airway pressure variations and may dramatic-
ally decrease the hemodynamic effects of mechanical
ventilation [37]. De Baker and Scolletta [38] demon-
strated that low tidal volume (<8 ml/kg) invalidates
the cutoff value of 12 % for pulsed pressure variation
(PPV) (a surrogate of stroke volume variation). In an
attempt to solve this problem, Liu et al. [39] sug-
gested estimating pleural pressure variations as a sur-
rogate
of
thoracic
pressure
variations
in
ARDS
patients and then adjusting the PPV accordingly in order
to improve prediction and prevent false negatives for fluid
responsiveness. This approach, however, requires measure-
ment of esophageal pressure using a balloon catheter, in-
creasing the complexity of care, and is therefore used
clinically in a small number of centers.
Advantages of measuring aortic blood flow during
mechanical ventilation
1. No additional maneuvers are required; standard
mechanical ventilation provides the dynamic
changes in preload.
Disadvantages of measuring aortic blood flow during
mechanical ventilation
1. The interobserver and intraobserver reliability of
measurements in cardiac output is highly operator
dependent. A skilled operator is required to achieve
high-quality measures of aortic blood flow.
2. Not accurate during arrhythmia.
3. Of limited utility with “open lung” ventilator
strategies which reduce pleural pressure swings.
Mechanical ventilation induced variations in vena-
caval diameter
Controlled ventilation
Under controlled mechanical ventilation, positive pressure
is applied into the thorax. The superior vena cava (SVC) is
therefore subjected to this positive pressure during mech-
anical insufflation. Vieillard-Baron et al. [40] demon-
strated that respiratory variation of the superior vena cava
analyzed using transesophageal echocardiography accur-
ately predicts fluid responsiveness of ICU patients with a
cutoff value of 36 %. Following this study there was a
revolution in ultrasound technology which facilitated a
less invasive approach, and in 2016 most clinicians prefer
transthoracic echocardiography rather than the trans-
esophageal approach to assess the IVC. Multiple studies
analyzed the IVC in ICU patients under controlled mech-
anical ventilation [41–44]. Together these studies demon-
strated that, like static measures of central venous
pressure, the absolute size of the IVC was not able to ac-
curately predict the effect of fluid infusion on cardiac out-
put. In contrast, the change in IVC diameter induced by
intrathoracic pressure swings during mechanical ventila-
tion is useful. Using the ratio between maximal size minus
minimum size to the average of these two values, Feissel
et al. [43] found that a variation higher than 12 % was as-
sociated with an increase of cardiac output after fluid infu-
sion. Barbier et al. [41] found that 18 % was the cutoff
value by using the ratio of the maximal size minus the
minimum size to the minimum size. All of these measure-
ments were made on M-mode images of a longitudinal
view of the IVC obtained from a subcostal window. Intra-
abdominal hypertension, the tidal volume, and the pa-
tient’s inspiratory efforts in spontaneous breathing may be
possible limitations of this approach [45].

 Spontaneously breathing patients
Following the initial resuscitation, most patients in
the modern era are nursed while awake and are en-
couraged to breathe in collaboration with the ventila-
tor.
This
means
that
in
awake,
spontaneously
breathing patients the swings in pleural pressures dur-
ing inspiration which are transmitted to the IVC can
vary from deeply negative (in those ventilated on
CPAP only, as in a spontaneous breathing trial) to
neutral/positive in cases with high levels of pressure
support or neuromuscular weakness. It has recently
been shown in healthy volunteers that the change in
IVC diameter is highly correlated with respiratory ef-
fort [46]. In our center we have found that the degree
of additional pressure support applied in a spontan-
eously breathing patient on mechanical ventilation
will dramatically change both the IVC diameter and
the degree of IVC collapse we observe. Figure 1
shows
IVC
tracings
in
a
patient
who
was
first
scanned while they were assisted with pressure sup-
port of 8 cmH2O above PEEP. Immediately following
this scan the patient began a spontaneous breathing
trial with 0 cmH2O additional support. Clearly both
the IVC diameter and fluctuation are highly influ-
enced even at modest levels of pressure support. This
intuitive but under-recognized fact has important im-
plications when interpreting the results of an ultra-
sound examination in awake patients with the intent
of guiding fluid therapy. Reports of changes in IVC
diameter in spontaneously breathing patients have
found that these failed to accurately predict fluid re-
sponsiveness.
For instance, IVC respiratory variations
>42 % in spontaneously breathing patients demonstrated a
high specificity (97 %) and a positive predictive value (90 %)
to predict an increase in CO after fluid infusion with a cut-
off value >42 % [47] but a low sensitivity and negative pre-
dictive
value.
A
recently
published
physiology-based
opinion suggests that IVC respiratory variations are in fact
prone to both false negatives and positives due to five major
categories: ventilator settings, patient’s inspiratory efforts,
lung hyperinflation, cardiac conditions impeding venous
return, and high intra-abdominal pressures [45].
Advantages of measuring vena caval diameter as a
surrogate of volume responsiveness during mechanical
ventilation
1. No additional maneuvers are required; the standard
mechanical ventilation provides the dynamic
changes in preload.
Fig. 1 A 57-year-old male patient admitted with septic shock 18 hours before imaging required 0.2 μg/kg/minute of norepinephrine to maintain
a mean arterial blood pressure of 70 mmHg. Central venous pressure via the right internal jugular catheter was 13 mmHg and he was in atrial
fibrillation, rate of 100 beats/minute. Sedation had been discontinued and the patient was awake and spontaneously breathing on a mechanical
ventilator. Using a subcostal approach the IVC was imaged using M-mode at 1.5 cm from the IVC–right atrial junction. The patient then began a
spontaneous breathing trial, with some translational movement of the IVC noted, and imaging continued. In this case the IVC diameter during
inspiration did not change according to the level of pressure support, whereas the end-expiratory IVC diameters were markedly greater with
positive pressure applied. Thus the delta IVC during usual mechanical ventilation was 29 %, while during his spontaneous breathing trial the delta
IVC was only 11 %. A CardioQ™ esophageal Doppler probe was in place and an optimal descending aortic blood flow was calculated. In this
patient the stroke volume increased from 49 to 65 ml (33 % increase) with a 500 ml bolus of plasmalyte™, and thus was truly volume responsive.

 Disadvantages of measuring vena caval diameter as a
surrogate of volume responsiveness during mechanical
ventilation
1. Of limited utility in controlled modes of ventilation
using “open lung” strategies which reduce pleural
pressure swings.
2. In awake patients, the IVC diameter and collapse are
highly dependent upon the patient’s respiratory
effort and levels of ventilatory support.
3. While echocardiography is of great value in the
diagnosis of right ventricular failure, more direct
measures of left ventricular performance such as
descending aortic Doppler flow are required in this
population.
Future directions
Left ventricular outflow tract obstruction
In a recent study, Chauvet et al. [48] found that 22 % pa-
tients in the early phase of septic shock presented with
functional left
ventricular outflow
tract
obstruction
(LVOTO). In most of these patients, fluid infusion de-
creased this obstruction, increased cardiac output, and
clinically improved the patient [48]. Pending confirm-
ation and prospective validation, LVOTO may be con-
sidered a new fluid-responsiveness parameter.
Conclusion
Ultrasound imaging of vena caval diameter fluctuation
with respiration is a safe, noninvasive method to assess
fluid responsiveness in apneic patients on controlled
mechanical ventilation. Two-thirds of patients will not be
fluid responsive following an initial volume resuscitation
of 30 ml/kg. In spontaneously breathing patients the
degree of IVC fluctuation is a function of both respiratory
effort and the pressure applied to assist ventilation, and
without standardized ventilator settings it has not been
proven a reliable indicator of fluid responsiveness.
