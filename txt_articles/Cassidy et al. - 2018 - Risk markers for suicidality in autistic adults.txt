Abstract
Background: Research has shown high rates of suicidality in autism spectrum conditions (ASC), but there is lack of
research into why this is the case. Many common experiences of autistic adults, such as depression or unemployment,
overlap with known risk markers for suicide in the general population. However, it is unknown whether there are risk
markers unique to ASC that require new tailored suicide prevention strategies.
Methods: Through consultation with a steering group of autistic adults, a survey was developed aiming to identify
unique risk markers for suicidality in this group. The survey measured suicidality (SBQ-R), non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI-AT),
mental health problems, unmet support needs, employment, satisfaction with living arrangements, self-reported autistic
traits (AQ), delay in ASC diagnosis, and ‘camouflaging’ ASC. One hundred sixty-four autistic adults (65 male, 99 female)
and 169 general population adults (54 males, 115 females) completed the survey online.
Results: A majority of autistic adults (72%) scored above the recommended psychiatric cut-off for suicide risk on the
SBQ-R; significantly higher than general population (GP) adults (33%). After statistically controlling for a range of
demographics and diagnoses, ASC diagnosis and self-reported autistic traits in the general population significantly
predicted suicidality. In autistic adults, non-suicidal self-injury, camouflaging, and number of unmet support needs
significantly predicted suicidality.
Conclusions: Results confirm previously reported high rates of suicidality in ASC, and demonstrate that ASC diagnosis,
and self-reported autistic traits in the general population are independent risk markers for suicidality. This suggests there are
unique factors associated with autism and autistic traits that increase risk of suicidality. Camouflaging and unmet support
needs appear to be risk markers for suicidality unique to ASC. Non-suicidal self-injury, employment, and mental health
problems appear to be risk markers shared with the general population that are significantly more prevalent in the autistic
community. Implications for understanding and prevention of suicide in ASC are discussed.

Background
There are elevated rates of suicidality in adults diag-
nosed with autism spectrum conditions (ASC) [1–5].
However, suicidality in ASC is poorly understood, and
there is a paucity of research exploring why adults with
ASC (henceforth, autistic adults) may be at increased
risk [6]. Although a number of studies have explored
suicidality in autistic adults, no study has yet utilised a
suicidality assessment tool with evidence of validity [4, 7,
8]. Non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) is a risk factor for
suicide attempts in the general population [9]. However,
to our knowledge, only one study has ever explored
NSSI in a small sample of autistic adults using a vali-
dated instrument but did not explore associations with
suicidality [10]. Clearly, it is crucial to better understand
suicidality in autistic adults, and associated risk markers,
using instruments with evidence of validity (albeit not
yet in autistic adults). Given the paucity of literature in
the area of suicide in ASC research, it is important to en-
gage with the autistic community in the refinement of re-
search priorities to speed up progress and benefit the end
users of research [11]. This is the aim of the current study.
Suicidal thoughts and behaviours are significantly
increased in autistic adults compared to the general
population and other clinical groups. In a large sample
of 374 adults newly diagnosed with Asperger syndrome

 (AS; autism without language delay or intellectual disability),
66% had contemplated suicide, significantly higher than the
general population (17%) and patients with psychosis (59%);
35% had planned or attempted suicide [2], higher than
previous estimates of attempted suicide in general and
university populations (2.5–10%) [12–14]. Only one study
has ever explored whether autistic people are more at risk
of dying by suicide than the general population; this popu-
lation study in Sweden showed that autistic people were
significantly more likely to die by suicide (0.31%) com-
pared to the general population (0.04%) [15].
Traits characteristic of autism are also significantly as-
sociated with suicidality in those with [2], and without
ASC diagnosis [16–18]. ASC diagnosis has also recently
been found to be an independent risk marker for suicide
attempts independent of demographic characteristics
and co-occurring diagnoses [19]. These findings suggest
that ASC explains additional variance in suicidality, not
accounted for by other well-known risk markers in the
general population which are more prevalent in ASC,
such as depression [20–22] or social isolation [23, 24],
which have been associated with increased risk of suicidality
in ASC [2, 15, 17, 25, 26]. Hence, there may be as yet
unknown unique risk markers for suicidality in ASC that
are not shared with the general population or other clinical
groups, requiring adapted suicide prevention strategies [6].
Studies exploring the characteristics of suicidality in
ASC could provide important clues for possible unique
risk markers in this group. For example, the highest
rates of suicidal ideation (66%) were reported in adults
newly diagnosed with AS, who had struggled without
support [2]. Age of diagnosis and adequate access to
post-diagnostic support could therefore be particularly
important in preventing suicidality in ASC [2]. However,
many children and adults diagnosed with ASC not only
struggle to obtain their diagnosis, but also struggle to
obtain post-diagnostic support [27–29]. Lack of tangible
social support has been associated with increased risk of
suicidality, indirectly through depression [25].
In the general population, the global male to female
ratio of deaths by suicide is estimated to be 1.7 [30],
indicating that males are more likely to die by suicide than
females. However, in the one available study exploring
death by suicide in the autistic community, autistic
females without intellectual disability (ID) were more at
risk of dying by suicide (0.32%) compared to autistic
males (0.3%); opposite to the general population where
males (0.05%) were more likely to die by suicide than
females (0.03%) [15]. Autistic females have been under-
researched, and it has been recognised that this group
may also be under-diagnosed [29, 31, 32]. Autistic people
report attempting to camouflage their ASC in order to try
and fit in in social situations, which may delay obtaining a
timely ASC diagnosis and negatively affect their mental
health [31–33]. However, no study has quantitatively
measured associations between ‘camouflaging’ and risk
of mental health difficulties or suicidality in both autistic
males and females.
In addition to lack of research into possible autism
specific risk markers for suicidality, some potentially
common risk factors for suicidality in those with and
without ASC diagnosis have very different conceptuali-
sations that have resulted in them being overlooked by
researchers and clinicians. For example, self-injurious
behaviour in ASC [34] is conceptualised rather differently
than NSSI in the general population, as primarily a restricted
and repetitive behaviour characteristic of ASC [35]. By con-
trast NSSI in the general population is considered a possible
risk marker for later suicide attempts [9]. Only one study
has explored NSSI in autistic adults without co-occurring
ID using a tool validated for online research in non-clinical
populations [10] (non-suicidal self-injury assessment tool
(NSSI-AT)) [36]. The rate of NSSI in ASC was elevated
(50%) compared to college students (17%) and adult com-
munity samples (23%), but the phenomenology of NSSI was
broadly similar between those with and without ASC [10].
Importantly, this suggests that NSSI could be more preva-
lent in ASC than that in the general population, and could
potentially be a previously unexplored common risk factor
for suicidality in ASC and the general population.
Previous research has taken a piecemeal approach to
furthering our understanding of suicidality in ASC.
Important limitations include the fact that no suicidality
studies in ASC have used a suicidality assessment tool
with evidence of validity in this group [7, 8], and very few
studies have included a comparison group [3]. Studies
have also failed to disentangle common shared and unique
risk markers for suicidality in autistic and general pop-
ulations, which is key to understanding and preventing
suicide in ASC [6].
The current study thus aimed to address these pitfalls
in previous suicidality in ASC research. First, we used
both a review of the available literature, and consultation
with a steering group of autistic adults who have experi-
enced suicidality, to ensure that we identified a range of
high priority risk markers for suicidality in autism, some
of which may be unique to this group. Second, we are
the first to utilise a well-validated suicidality assessment
tool
(the
Suicide
Behaviours
Questionnaire-Revised
(SBQ-R)) [37] in autistic adults (confirmed in a systematic
review) [7], and NSSI assessment tool previously utilised
in autistic adults (NSSI-AT) [10]. We also include a
general population comparison group. Hence, we are able
to explore whether autistic adults are at increased risk of
suicidality compared to the general population, while
controlling for known common risk factors for suicidality
(e.g. age, sex, mental health problems, employment, living
situation). We also explore for the first time a potentially

 unique risk marker for suicidality and NSSI in ASC males
and ASC females—camouflaging ASC in order to cope in
social situations—as well as age of ASC diagnosis, and
unmet support needs. We also explore whether NSSI is an
independent risk marker for suicidality in those with and
without ASC, and whether autistic traits are an independ-
ent risk marker for suicidality in the general population
without ASC diagnosis.
Method
Participants
The ASC group comprised 164 adults (65 males; 99 females)
who self-reported a diagnosis of ASC from a trained clin-
ician, and a majority (81.1%) confirmed the clinic where this
diagnosis was obtained. The general population group com-
prised 169 adults (54 males; 115 females). Participants were
aged between 20 and 60 years old (Table 1). There were no
significant differences in age (t(331) = .657, p = .511) or sex
ratio (χ2 (1) = 2.14, p = .14) between the ASC and general
population group. The ASC group scored significantly
higher on the Autism-Spectrum Quotient (AQ) (36.42)
than the general population group (19.87) (t(331) = .657,
p < .001). See Table 1 for group demographics.
Participants were recruited from research volunteers
databases located in the Autism Research Centre at the
University of Cambridge. Autistic adults and their family
members across the UK and internationally register in
the Cambridge Autism Research Database (CARD)
(https://www.autismresearchcentre.net/). General popu-
lation adults without an autism diagnosis or autistic
family members register at a separate website (https://
www.cambridgepsychology.com/login). Volunteers regis-
ter in these databases to receive information about a
variety of psychology research projects and not mental
health specifically. Additionally, participants were recruited
from online adverts.
Measures
Survey development
An online questionnaire exploring mental health, self-injury,
and thoughts of ending life was developed for the current
study in partnership with a steering group of eight adults
diagnosed with ASC (6 females, 2 males) through a series of
6 focus groups. Given the topic of the survey, all steering
group members were recruited by advertising for autistic
adults who would like to share their experience to influence
research and improve support for mental health problems,
self-injury, and suicidality. The first three focus groups
developed the topics to be captured in the questionnaire.
First, the researchers proposed a number of topics thought
to be important contributors to mental health and suicidality
in autism, and the focus group fed back on the relevance
and importance of these proposed topics, and whether any
important topics were missing. This ensured that a large
array of possible risk markers was prioritised for the
study. Subsequent focus groups discussed participants’
experiences of the topics. The researchers then devel-
oped a survey to capture these topics and experiences.
The steering group provided feedback on three drafts
of the survey to ensure that the questions were com-
prehensive, relevant, and clear.
Demographics
Participants who completed the online survey provided
information on age, biological birth sex, education,
employment, living situation, diagnosed developmental
and mental health conditions, current medication, whether
they were currently receiving any treatment for mental
health problems, suicidal thoughts, self-injury or other
reason. Participants also reported whether they need or
currently receive support, and if yes, were asked (a) in
which areas they would ideally like support in (in the
home, with employment, health care, mental health care,
finance, social activities, in the community, organisation,
mentoring, education, other); and (b) in which of these
areas they actually receive support. Unmet support needs
were thus calculated as the mismatch between the number
of areas participants actually received support, compared
to the number of areas participants would ideally like
support (unmet support needs = n areas support ideally
liked—n areas support actually received) (Table 1).
Camouflaging
A brief set of four questions were designed to quantify
tendency to camouflage in the current study. Autistic
adults were asked “Have you ever tried to camouflage or
mask your characteristics of ASC to cope with social
situations? For example, have you ever tried to copy or
mimic other people’s behaviour to try and fit in (e.g.
copying another person’s accent or mannerisms), or tried
to mask or hide your symptoms of ASC from other
people?” If participants responded yes, they subsequently
(a) specified the areas in which they camouflage (work,
educational settings, social gatherings, when visiting
the doctors, when visiting a health professional, at
home, with friends, other); (b) the overall frequency
they camouflage on a scale from 1 (never) to 6 (always
(over 90% of social situations)); and (c) overall amount
of the day they spend camouflaging on a scale from 1
(none of my waking time) to 6 (all of my waking time
(over 90% of social situations)). Scores were calculated
as the sum of number of areas (maximum 8), overall
frequency (maximum 6), and overall amount (maximum 6),
with a maximum score of 20 overall. Internal consistency
for the whole scale was acceptable in the ASC group
(α = .75).

 Autism-Spectrum Quotient (AQ)
The Autism-Spectrum Quotient (AQ) is a 50-item
questionnaire assessing the number of self-reported
autistic traits [38]. The AQ has been shown to reliably
distinguishing those with and without a diagnosis of
ASC [38, 39], with scores ≥ 26 indicating potential diag-
nosis of ASC [40].
Non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI)
The non-suicidal self-injury assessment tool (NSSI-AT)
[36] was used to screen for presence of any form of life-
time NSSI in the current sample. Participants were first
asked the screening question “Have you ever hurt your
body (e.g. cut, carve, burn, scratch really hard, punch)
on purpose but without wanting to end your life?” If yes,
participants then completed sections A–B of the NSSI-
AT to confirm that suicidality was not the primary reason
for their self-harm. Subsequently, responses were classified
as endorsing lifetime NSSI, or no lifetime NSSI.
The NSSI-AT was developed as a research tool to assess
NSSI online in non-clinical populations and has previ-
ously been shown to have adequate measurement proper-
ties in college students; test-retest reliability for any form
of NSSI was 0.74, with moderate correlations with related
behavioural problems [36]. One study has previously used
the NSSI-AT in an ASC adult sample and found evidence
in support of similar phenomenology of NSSI in those
with and without ASC [10].

completed
the
Suicide
Behaviours
Questionnaire-Revised (SBQ-R) [37], a 4-item self-report
questionnaire that assesses lifetime suicidal behaviour,
suicide ideation over the past 12 months, threat of
suicide attempt, and likelihood of suicidal behaviour in
the future. The SBQ-R has been validated for use in
general population and clinical samples to reliably dis-
tinguish suicide attempters from non-attempters [37],
and is widely used in research, with moderate-strong
evidence in support of internal consistency, structural
validity, hypothesis testing, and criterion validity in clinical
and non-clinical samples [7]. Internal consistency for the
whole scale was acceptable in both autistic adults (α = .76)
and general population adults (α = .768).
Ethical approval
The current study received ethical approval from Coventry
University Psychology Ethics Committee and was approved
by the autism steering group who fed back on the ques-
tionnaire, and the scientific advisory group at the Autism
Research Centre, University of Cambridge, prior to
recruiting participants registered in the Cambridge Autism
Research Database (CARD).
Procedure
Participants with and without ASC diagnosis were invited
to complete an online survey about understanding and
preventing mental health problems, self-injury, and suicid-
ality. Participants could take part regardless of prior experi-
ence of mental health difficulties, self-injury or suicidality.
Participants read the participant information and indicated
informed consent to participate via an online form. Partici-
pants were fully briefed about the nature of the research,
that they could skip sections and/or questions that made
them feel uncomfortable, and were provided information
about relevant support services before and after taking
part in the study. Participants subsequently completed
questions on demographics, diagnoses (mental health,
developmental conditions, and ASC), NSSI-AT, camoufla-
ging, AQ, SBQ-R, current treatment (for mental health,
self-injury, or suicidality), and support (areas in which
support was actually received and ideally liked but not yet
received).
Analysis approach
Data were analysed using SPSS 24. Chi-square analysis
was used to explore group differences in frequency of
lifetime NSSI, lifetime experience of camouflaging, and
demographics, with odds ratios (with 95% confidence in-
tervals) calculated as a measure of effect size. Independent
samples t tests were used to compare total scores on the
SBQ-R, AQ, and camouflaging questionnaires between
groups, with Cohen’s d as a measure of effect size (where
0.2 = small, 0.5 = medium, and 0.8 = large effect) [41]. One
sample t tests compared SBQ-R total scores to established
cut-offs in general and psychiatric populations. Spearman’s
correlations were used to explore inter-correlations between
all variables in each group (where 0.1 = small, 0.3 = medium,
and 0.5 = large effect). Multiple hierarchical regressions
subsequently explored whether significant associations
between demographics and diagnoses with suicidality
remained when controlling for significant covariates.
The SBQ-R was non-normally distributed. Analyses were
therefore undertaken using bootstrapping techniques, a
robust analysis technique which is reliable even when as-
sumptions of a symmetric distribution are not met [42].
Utilising this robust analysis technique did not alter the
pattern of results, with similar direction and magnitude
of effects and statistical significance found using boot-

Suicidality
There was no significant difference in total SBQ-R scores
between autistic males and autistic females (t(162) = .671,
p = .503), so results were pooled. A one sample t test
showed that autistic adults SBQ-R total scores were
significantly higher than the recommended cut-off for
the general population (7) (t(163) = 10.92, p < .001), and
psychiatric populations (8) (t(163) = 7.71, p < .001) [33].
A majority (72%) of autistic adults scored at or above
the cut-off for psychiatric populations (8) (Table 1).
There was a significant difference in total SBQ-R
scores between general population (GP) males and females
(t(167) = 2.06, p = .041), so data from males and females
were analysed separately. One sample t tests showed
that GP males SBQ-R scores were not significantly
different from the recommended cut-off for the gen-
eral (t(53) = .956, p = .343) or psychiatric population
(t(162) = .671, p = .503). GP females scored significantly
lower than the recommended cut off for the general
(t(114) = 2.211,
p = .029)
and
psychiatric
population
(t(114) = 5.694, p < .001) (Table 1).
Autistic adults scored significantly higher on the SBQ-R
than GP adults (t(331) = 9.131, p < .001, d = 1) and were sig-
nificantly more likely to score above the psychiatric cut-off
for suicide risk (72%) than GP adults (33.7%) (χ2(1) = 48.77,
p < .001, OR 5.04, 95% CI 3.16–8.04) (Table 1).
NSSI
Significantly more autistic females (74%) reported NSSI
than autistic males (53.8%) (χ2(1) = 6.97, p < .01, OR 2.43,
95% CI 1.25–4.74). There was no significant sex difference
in NSSI in the GP group (χ2(1) = .486, p = .486). Autistic

 adults were significantly more likely to report lifetime
NSSI (65%) than GP adults (29.8%) (χ2(1) = 42.91, p < .001,
OR 4.55, 95% CI 2.86–7.23) (Table 1).
Demographics
Compared to the general population, autistic adults reported
significantly lower satisfaction with their living arrangements
(t(146) = 2.82, p = .005; d = .4) were significantly more likely
to be unemployed (χ2(1) = 33.95, p < .001, OR 4.07, 95% CI
2.5–6.61), be diagnosed with at least one co-occurring devel-
opmental condition (χ2(1) = 34.02, p < .001, OR 16.12, 95%
CI 4.86–53.47), at least one mental health or other condition
(χ2(1) = 39.18, p < .001, OR 5.3, 95% CI 3.06–9.19), depres-
sion (χ2(1) = 43.1, p < .001, OR 4.86, 95% CI 2.98–7.91),
anxiety (χ2(1) = 41.56, p < .001, OR 4.41, 95% CI 2.78–6.99),
and report higher unmet support needs (t(176) = 4.91,
p < .001; d = .87) (Table 1).
Camouflaging
There was no significant difference between autistic
males (89.2%) and autistic females (90.9%) in terms of
whether they attempted to camouflage their ASC in
order to fit in in social situations (χ2(1) = .126, p = .723).
However, autistic females scored significantly higher on
the camouflaging questionnaire overall (14.7, SD 3.61)
than autistic males (12.9, SD 4.06) (t(146) = 2.82, p = .005;
d = .47) (Table 1).
Predictors of suicidality in ASC
Table 2 shows the results of all inter correlations between
variables in the ASC group. Lifetime NSSI, camouflaging,
ADHD, depression, anxiety, unmet support needs, and
satisfaction with living arrangements all significantly
correlated with suicidality (total SBQ-R scores). How-
ever, age of diagnosis was not significantly correlated
with any other variables.
Hierarchical regression models were performed with
total SBQ-R scores as the outcome variable. To statisti-
cally control for these variables, age at testing and gender
were entered into the first step, and employment, satisfac-
tion with living arrangements, developmental conditions,
depression, and anxiety entered into the second step. The
third step explored additional variance accounted for
by the predictor variable. Separate models explored the
additional predictive contribution of ASC diagnosis (in
the combined ASC and GP groups), lifetime experience
of NSSI, camouflaging questionnaire total scores, and
unmet support needs (in the ASC sub-group), to the
model. Age of ASC diagnosis was not explored further as
a unique predictor given that this did not significantly
correlate with any other variables (Table 2).
ASC diagnosis
In step one, the regression model containing sex and
age significantly predicted SBQ-R scores (F(2,330) = 6.99,
p < .001), accounting for 4.1% of the variance. In step two,
employment, satisfaction with living arrangements, pres-
ence of at least one developmental condition, depression,
and anxiety accounted for significantly more of the vari-
ance (33.4%) in SBQ-R scores (F(5,325) = 34.79, p < .001).
In step three, autism diagnosis accounted for significantly
more of the variance (4.5%) in SBQ-R scores (F(1,324) =
24.9, p < .001) (Table 3).
NSSI
In step one, the regression model containing sex and age
did not significantly predict SBQ-R scores (F(2,158) = 1.99,
p = .141), accounting for only 2.5% of the variance. In step
two, employment, satisfaction with living arrangements,
presence of at least one developmental condition, depres-
sion, and anxiety accounted for significantly more of
the variance (19.9%) in SBQ-R scores (F(5,153) = 7.84,
p < .001). In step three, NSSI accounted for significantly
more of the variance (4%) in SBQ-R scores (F(1,152) =
6.78, p = .005) (Table 4).
Camouflaging
In step one, the regression model containing sex and age
did not significantly predict SBQ-R scores (F(2,145) = .529,
p = .59), accounting for only 0.7% of the variance. In step
two, employment, satisfaction with living arrangements, at
least one developmental condition, depression, and anxiety
accounted for significantly more of the variance (20.7%)
in SBQ-R scores (F(5,140) = 7.39, p < .001). In step
three, camouflaging total scores accounted for signifi-
cantly more of the variance (3.5%) in SBQ-R scores
(F(1,139) = 6.56, p = .01) (Table 5).
Unmet support needs
In step one, the regression model containing sex and age
did not significantly predict SBQ-R scores (F(2,123) = .233,
p = .793), accounting for only 0.4% of the variance. In step
two, employment, satisfaction with living arrangements, at
least one developmental condition, depression, and anxiety
accounted for significantly more of the variance (13.5%) in
SBQ-R scores (F(5,118) = 3.7, p = .004). In step three,
unmet support needs accounted for significantly more
of the variance (3.1%) in SBQ-R scores (F(1,117) = 4.32,
p = .04) (Table 6).
Predictors of suicidality in the general population
Table 7 shows the results of all inter correlations between
variables in the GP group. Self-reported autistic traits (AQ
total scores), lifetime NSSI, depression, anxiety, satisfaction
with living arrangements and employment all significantly
correlated with suicidality (total SBQ-R scores).

 A hierarchical regression model was thus performed
with total SBQ-R scores as the outcome variable. To
statistically control for these variables, age at testing and
gender were entered into the first step. To statistically con-
trol for additional co-variates, employment, satisfaction
with living arrangements, developmental conditions, de-
pression, and anxiety were entered into the second step.
The third and final step explored much additional variance
in suicidality was explained by self-reported autistic traits.
Autistic traits
In step one, the regression model containing sex and
age significantly predicted SBQ-R scores (F(2,166) = 7.57,
p < .001), accounting for 8.4% of the variance. In step two,
employment, satisfaction with living arrangements, pres-
ence of at least one developmental condition, depression,
and anxiety accounted for significantly more of the vari-
ance (31.5%) in SBQ-R scores (F(5,161) = 16.85, p < .001).

Discussion
Previous research exploring suicidality in ASC has failed to
include adequately sized samples, matched comparison
groups, explore risk or protective factors [2, 3, 6], or include
validated suicidality assessment tools [7]. The current study
aimed to address these weaknesses of previous research, to
identify common and unique risk markers for suicidality in
ASC. Specifically, whether there are unique aspects of ASC
and autistic traits that increase risk of suicidality, after
statistically controlling for common risk factors such as age,
sex, employment, or mental health. We then explored
possible unique risk factors which could explain increased
risk of suicide in ASC, identified by our steering group of
autistic adults: camouflaging one’s ASC in an attempt to fit
in in social situations, age of ASC diagnosis, whether people
felt they received the support they required, and NSSI.
Previous studies have not systematically studied unique and
common risk markers for suicidality in ASC compared to
the general population, which has prevented development
of tailored suicide prevention strategies for this group [6].
Results are consistent with previous findings that autistic
adults are at significantly increased risk of suicidality com-
pared to the general population [2]. A majority (72%) of
autistic adults scored significantly above the recommended
cut-off for suicide risk in psychiatric populations, signifi-
cantly higher than general population adults (33%) with
similar age and gender composition. This significant

 association
between
ASC
diagnosis
and
suicidality
remained when controlling for a number of demographics
and diagnoses, known to increase or decrease risk of suicid-
ality in the general population (employment, depression,
anxiety, and satisfaction with living arrangements). Add-
itionally, the significant association between self-reported
autistic traits in the general population and suicidality
remained after statistically controlling for these demograph-
ics and diagnoses. These results suggest that autism diagno-
sis and autistic traits explain significant additional variance
in suicidality beyond a range of known risk factors, and are
therefore independent risk markers for suicidality. This is
consistent with research showing that ASC diagnosis is an
independent risk marker for suicide attempts when control-
ling for a range of demographics and co-occurring diagno-
ses [19]. These
findings
suggest
additional
unique
contributors to suicidality in ASC, which must be ad-
dressed in addition to important well-known factors such
as mental health, employment, and living arrangements.
The current study explored a potentially unique risk
marker for suicidality in ASC, identified by our steering
group of autistic adults: tendency to camouflage one’s
ASC in order to cope in social situations. Previous
research [29, 32] and discussions with our steering
group identified camouflaging as an important potential
barrier to timely ASC diagnosis, and having a negative
impact on mental health and risk of suicidality. Previous
research has also suggested that camouflaging is primarily
experienced by autistic females [31, 33], which may at least
in part explain why this group has been under-diagnosed
[43]. Results from the current study however showed sub-
tle differences in camouflaging behaviour between autistic
males and females: there was no sex difference in reporting
whether one engages in camouflaging behaviour, but
autistic females tended to report that they camouflaged
across more situations, more frequently and more of
the time than autistic males.
Camouflaging significantly predicted suicidality in the
ASC group, after controlling for age, sex, presence of at
least one developmental condition, depression, anxiety,
employment, and satisfaction with living arrangements.
Camouflaging and age of ASC diagnosis, and suicidality
and age of ASC diagnosis were not significantly correlated.
This suggests that camouflaging is directly associated with
suicidality rather than in combination with delay in ASC
diagnosis. Camouflaging also explained significant add-
itional variance in suicidality above depression or anxiety,
suggesting that the association with suicidality is, at least
in part, independent of mental health. This is the first
evidence of camouflaging being a unique independent
risk factor for suicidality in ASC.
In order to engage in camouflaging, one must have
insight into one’s own difficulties, how these may be nega-
tively perceived by others, and have a strong motivation to
adapt one’s social behaviour to be accepted. Understand-
ing associations between these factors with camouflaging,
and the consequent impact on mental health would be
valuable. For example, autistic people who have greater
insight into their own difficulties are more likely to be
depressed than those with less insight [44], and autistic
people are able to accurately predict how family members
perceive them, despite being different to their own view
[45]. It would be interesting to explore whether perspective
taking ability and insight into one’s own difficulties increase
likelihood of engaging in camouflaging behaviour with con-
sequent negative impact on mental health and suicidality.
Importantly, our findings challenge the assumption
that autistic people are socially unmotivated, consistent
with calls for more accurate and useful autism research,
embracing the unique nature of social interest in autism
[46]. It is perhaps more accurate to acknowledge a “double
empathy problem”, where autistic people are misinter-
preted by non-autistic people and vice versa [45, 47, 48],
which contribute to feelings of isolation among autistic
people [49]. Increasing acceptance of autistic people in
society could therefore lead to a reduced need for camou-
flaging and increased feelings of belonging—a protective
factor for suicidality [17, 23].
Contrary to expectations, and discussions with our
autistic steering group, age of ASC diagnosis was not
significantly correlated with any other variables, such as
mental health problems, suicidality, or NSSI. However,
this may have been due to the fact that the mean age of
ASC diagnosis was 34 years, and therefore, participants
represent autistic people diagnosed in adulthood. Future
research will need to explore whether those diagnosed in
childhood are significantly less likely to experience mental
health problems of suicidality compared to those diag-
nosed in adulthood. Another important theme identified
from discussions with our steering group was lack of
access to support, which could compound mental health
difficulties and suicidality. Previous research has shown
that the autistic community is disconnected from psychi-
atric services [18], as many practitioners are not trained in
ASC [50]. The current study therefore quantitatively
explored the mismatch between the number of areas an
individual would ideally like support, compared to the
number of areas they actually received support. These
unmet support needs significantly predicted suicidality
in the ASC group when controlling for the aforemen-
tioned variables. Hence, a clear recommendation for
policy and practice to reduce suicide risk in autistic
adults, a high-risk group for dying by suicide [15], is to
urgently identify and address unmet support needs in
this group. Meeting this shortfall in support could, at
least in part, help reduce high rates of suicidality and
death by suicide in the autistic community. Research
from our group is exploring in more depth barriers and

 enablers in accessing treatment and support in autistic
adults, to help assist in service planning.
The rate of NSSI in the ASC group (63.6%) was signifi-
cantly higher than the general population group (29.8%),
and similar to the rate reported in previous research [10]
(50%), which also utilised the NSSI-AT in autistic adults.
NSSI also significantly predicted suicidality in autistic
adults, after controlling for a range of known risk factors.
Hence, NSSI should not continue to be overlooked, or
seen as part of ASC, and rather must be addressed in its
own right. Our findings are therefore an important call to
action for the research community and clinicians to
increase understanding and support for those with ASC
experiencing NSSI. However, future studies will need to
explore whether this rate of NSSI in ASC adults remains
stable, and explore the measurement properties of NSSI
assessment tools in ASC.
The current study has a number of strengths as well
as limitations. This study is the first to use measures of
suicidality (SBQ-R) and NSSI (NSSI-AT) that have good
evidence of validity, albeit not yet in autistic adults [7, 10].
There is a paucity of validated outcome measures for
autistic adults, and using tools validated for the general
population is an important stop gap until tools adapted
for autistic people become available [7, 10, 51–53]. The
current study was only cross-sectional, and it is unclear
for example whether unmet support needs are a cause or
consequence of suicidality. The current study focused on
adults, without intellectual disability (ID), and it is un-
known whether autism and autistic traits would similarly
be a unique risk marker for those with co-occurring ID.
Although autism, autistic traits, unmet support needs, and
camouflaging explained significant additional variance in
suicidality when statistically controlling for a number of
other factors, the additional variance explained was small.
ASC diagnosis was assessed by self-report only; however,
a majority of participants confirmed the clinic where this
diagnosis was obtained. Lifetime suicide attempts in the
general population (8%) and ASC group (38%) are similar
to previous studies [2, 17], which suggests that the sample
was not biased in this respect. However, lifetime experi-
ence of depression in the general population (44.9%) and
ASC group (80%) were much higher than previous esti-
mates [2, 22, 54], despite participants not being recruited
because of experience with mental health problems. The
rate of mental health difficulties in the current sample
therefore may not be representative of the general or
autistic populations. A majority of participants in the
steering group and online survey were female. There-
fore, it could be argued that the topics explored in the
survey and study findings apply mostly to autistic females
and may not be generalisable to autistic males. However, a
majority of autistic males and autistic females reported
camouflaging,
and
regression
analyses
statistically
controlled for sex, suggesting this and other risk
markers apply to both sexes.
A key strength and novel aspect of the current study
was the participatory research element with a group of
autistic adults, who refined the focus of the study, and
the content of the survey. This ensured that the study
included a range of possible unique and common risk
factors for suicidality not explored or considered in pre-
vious research on this topic. It also ensured high content
validity of the survey, which was refined through three
iterations of feedback from the steering group. Previous
research has shown that the views of the autistic com-
munity which the research affects are rarely included,
which can hamper the potential benefits of ASC research
for the wider community [11]. Our study demonstrates
the importance of including the voices of autistic people
in important and sensitive research that can impact their
lives.
Conclusions
The current study is the first to use validated assessment
tools, and survey co-designed with autistic people, to
explore unique risk factors for suicidality in this group.
Results reiterate that rates of suicidality in autistic adults
are higher than the general population, and ASC diagnosis
and autistic traits are independent risk markers for suicid-
ality. Importantly, unique risk markers for suicidality in
ASC include camouflaging one’s ASC in order to fit in in
social situations and number of unmet support needs.
These explain small but significant additional variance in
suicidality in ASC, above a range of known risk factors
common with the general population. Future research
must further explore these and identify other unique
mechanisms driving suicidality in ASC to develop new
effective suicide prevention strategies for this group.
