Background.
Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine effectiveness and herd protection are not well established in community
settings. Our objective was to determine trends in vaccine-type HPV in young women during the 8 years after vaccine introduction,
to assess changes in HPV prevalence and characterize herd protection in a community.
Methods.
We recruited 3 samples of sexually experienced, 13–26-year-old adolescent girls and young women (hereafter women;
N = 1180) from 2006–2014: before widespread vaccine introduction (wave 1) and 3 (wave 2) and 7 (wave 3) years after vaccine in-
troduction. We determined the prevalence of vaccine-type HPV (HPV-6, -11, -16, and -18) among all, vaccinated, and unvaccinated
women at waves 1, 2, and 3, adjusted for differences in participant characteristics, then examined whether changes in HPV preva-
lence were significant using inverse propensity score–weighted logistic regression.
Results.
Vaccination rates increased from 0% to 71.3% across the 3 waves. Adjusted vaccine-type HPV prevalence changed from
34.8% to 8.7% (75.0% decline) in all women, from 34.9% to 3.2% (90.8% decline) in vaccinated women, and from 32.5% to 22.0%
(32.3% decline) in unvaccinated women. Among vaccinated participants, vaccine-type HPV prevalence decreased significantly from
wave 1 to wave 2 (adjusted odds ratio, 0.21; 95% confidence interval, .13–.34) and from wave 1 to wave 3 (0.06; .03–.13). The same
decreases were also significant among unvaccinated participants (adjusted odds ratios, 0.44; [95% confidence interval, .27–.71] and
0.59; [.35–.98], respectively).
Conclusions.
The prevalence of vaccine-type HPV decreased >90% in vaccinated women, demonstrating high effectiveness in a
community setting, and >30% in unvaccinated women, providing evidence of herd protection.

Three available prophylactic human papillomavirus (HPV) vac-
cines have been shown in clinical trials to be highly effective in
preventing HPV infection; cervical intraepithelial neoplasia;
and vulvar, vaginal, and anal cancer precursors and cancer in
women [1–4]. Cervical cancer is the third most commonly di-
agnosed cancer and the fourth leading cause of cancer death in
women worldwide, accounting for >275 000 deaths annually
[5]. In the United States, 12 900 new cervical cancer cases and
4100 deaths were expected in 2015 [6]. The US Advisory Com-
mittee on Immunization Practices recommended HPV vaccina-
tion of young women in 2006 and young men in 2011 [7–9].
The best early indicators of the public health impact of HPV
vaccine introduction in communities will be a decline in the
prevalence of vaccine-type HPV [10] and an increase in herd
protection [11]. Clinical trials data cannot accurately predict
vaccine effectiveness or the health impact of HPV vaccination
in communities, because vaccination initiation and completion
rates are difficult to predict, and women in clinical trials were
healthy volunteers, most of whom were uninfected with vac-
cine-type HPV at baseline and received all 3 vaccine doses
[1–3]. Vaccine effectiveness could be lower among young
women in the community who may be at higher risk of HPV
infection at the time of vaccination than those enrolled in clin-
ical trials [12, 13]. Alternatively, herd protection is likely to in-
crease vaccine effectiveness, depending on the level of vaccine
coverage needed to achieve herd protection.
Information about the epidemiologic impact of HPV vaccine
introduction over time is essential to assess the population ef-
fects of HPV immunization programs and to guide future pro-
gram and policy decisions concerning vaccination and cervical
cancer screening. We previously conducted 2 surveillance

 studies to compare HPV prevalence before and 3 years after vac-
cine introduction among 13–26-year-old adolescent girls and
young women (hereafter women). We found a substantial de-
cline in vaccine-type HPV prevalence overall and evidence for
herd protection (a decline in vaccine-type HPV among unvac-
cinated women) [14]. These data provided the first evidence in
the United States of the impact of HPV vaccine introduction in
women, but observation over a longer time period is essential to
confirm and more accurately characterize these early epidemio-
logic trends.
Therefore, we implemented a third surveillance study 7 years
after vaccine introduction, with 2 specific aims: (1) to determine
trends in vaccine-type HPV among all and among vaccinated
young women to assess the effect of HPV vaccine introduction
on vaccine-type HPV prevalence in the community and (2) to de-
termine trends in vaccine-type HPV prevalence among unvacci-
nated young women to characterize herd protection after vaccine
introduction. Our hypothesis was that the proportions of vacci-
nated and unvaccinated young women infected with vaccine-
type HPV would decline significantly across the 3 time periods.
METHODS
We recruited young women 13–26 years of age for surveillance
studies in 2006–2007 (n = 371), 2009–2010 (n = 409), and
2013–2014 (n = 400) [14]. The study was approved by the hos-
pital’s institutional review board, and written informed consent
was obtained. Participants were recruited for all 3 studies from 3
sites that provide primary care to adolescents and young adults:
a hospital-based teen health center and 2 health department
sites (a community health center and sexually transmitted dis-
ease clinic). The only HPV vaccine administered in these clin-
ical settings during the 3 study waves was the quadrivalent
(HPV-6, -11, -16, and -18) vaccine. Adolescent and young
adult women who were sexually experienced, defined as having
had sexual contact (genital-oral or genital-genital with a male
or female partner), were eligible to participate using a sequential
sampling strategy; those who had participated in the previous
surveillance studies were not eligible.
The study procedures were identical to those previously pub-
lished and included completion of a self-administered survey
instrument and cervicovaginal testing for HPV [14, 15]. The
survey items were developed over a 15-year period and validated
in several studies [15–19]. Cervicovaginal swabs were collected
for HPV DNA testing, using a clinician- or self-collected sam-
pling method [15, 20]. All samples were genotyped for HPV,
using the Roche Linear Array test, a polymerase chain reaction
amplification technique that uses an L1 consensus primer sys-
tem and a reverse-line blot detection strip to identify 36 HPV
genotypes (Roche Molecular Systems) [21, 22]. β-Globin con-
trols were positive in 100% of the samples in wave 1, 99.8% in
wave 2, and 98.8% in wave 3, indicating adequate DNA for po-
lymerase chain reaction amplification.
Data were analyzed using SAS software (version 9.3; SAS In-
stitute). Independent variables included vaccination rates, time
since vaccination, HPV knowledge, and self-reported sociode-
mographic characteristics and behaviors. Vaccination was de-
fined as having received at least 1 HPV vaccine dose before
enrollment and was assessed by review of electronic medical re-
cord and Ohio statewide immunization registry data. Depen-
dent variables included vaccine-type HPV (HPV-6, -11, -16
and/or -18), high-risk vaccine-type HPV (HPV-16 and/or
HPV-18), and any HPV (≥1 HPV type).
We generated descriptive statistics for all independent and
dependent variables, then compared participant characteristics,
using χ2 or analysis of variance, to determine whether there
were any differences by study wave in participant characteris-
tics. Because of between-wave differences for some variables,
we performed a propensity score analysis based on inverse
probability of treatment weighting [23, 24]. Propensity score
analysis adjusts for selection bias, allowing one to analyze an
observational study so that it mimics the characteristics of a ran-
domized controlled trial [25]. Variables were selected to evalu-
ate whether participants across 3 waves were comparable in
terms of sociodemographic characteristics, gynecologic history,
sexual history, and enrollment site, independent of the study
outcome. The purpose of this analysis was to evaluate whether
differences in HPV prevalence across the 3 waves were due to
HPV vaccine introduction, rather than confounding factors.
To ensure that the distribution of baseline covariates was sim-
ilar between subjects in different waves, we checked for adequa-
cy of the estimated propensity score [24]. For all the variables
presented in Table 1, the standardized differences after propen-
sity weighting were <0.2, indicating that the difference in vari-
able means between the waves was <0.2 times the pooled
standard deviation [23]. We then compared the prevalence of
baseline variables, vaccine-type HPV, high-risk vaccine-type
HPV, and any HPV across the study waves by vaccination status
(among all, vaccinated, and unvaccinated women), before and
after propensity weighting.
The comparison of all women was defined as HPV preva-
lence among all women across waves 1, 2, and 3 (all women
in wave 1 were unvaccinated; women in waves 2 and 3 were ei-
ther vaccinated or unvaccinated); the comparison of vaccinated
women, as HPV prevalence among all women in wave 1 and
vaccinated women in waves 2 and 3; and the comparison of un-
vaccinated women, as HPV prevalence among all women in
wave 1 and unvaccinated women in waves 2 and 3. Finally,
we compared the proportions of women infected with vac-
cine-type, high-risk vaccine-type, and any HPV across the 3
study waves, before and after propensity weighting, using logis-
tic regression models. The dependent variable was HPV preva-
lence, and the independent variable was study wave. Regression
models were performed for all, vaccinated, and unvaccinated
women, as defined above. Because all baseline variables were

 balanced after propensity weighting, no additional covariates
were included in the logistic regression models.
RESULTS
A total of 1180 participants were enrolled. Across the 3 waves,
between 95.2% and 97.6% of those who were approached to
participate were eligible, and ≥98% of those eligible agreed to
participate. None were vaccinated at wave 1, and 242 (59.2%)
and 286 (71.3%) were vaccinated at waves 2 and 3, respectively.
Across the 3 waves, 62.5%–65.5% of participants were re-
cruited from the Teen Health Center, the mean age was 18.7–
19.1 years, the majority (69.9%–73.0%) identified as black or
multiracial, and most (52.8–67.3%) had Medicaid (public)
insurance (Table 1). A substantial proportion (15.8%–21.5%)
reported sexual initiation at ≤13 years of age, most (80.6%–
87.8%) reported ≥2 lifetime sexual partners, and 30.2%–
31.0% reported >5 lifetime sexual partners. Approximately
one-third (32.6%–35.7%) had used a condom at last sexual in-
tercourse, and 21.9%–31.8% had smoked ≥100 cigarettes.
A comparison of participant characteristics across study
waves yielded several statistically significant differences. After
propensity score weighting, all baseline variables were balanced.
In addition, as noted above, 3 sets of comparisons of baseline
data were done: for all women, vaccinated women, and unvac-
cinated women. For these comparisons, after propensity score
weighting all baseline variables were also balanced.
The proportions of women infected with vaccine-type, high-
risk vaccine-type, and any HPV across the 3 study waves, unad-
justed and adjusted for propensity scores, are shown in Table 2.
The adjusted proportion of all women infected with ≥1 vaccine-
type HPV decreased from 34.8% to 8.7% over the 3 waves, for an
absolute decrease of 26.1% and an overall decline of 75.0%. The
absolute decrease and overall decline were 31.7% and 90.8%, re-
spectively, among vaccinated and 10.5% and 32.3% among

 unvaccinated women. Trends were similar for high-risk, vac-
cine-type HPV: the overall decline was 74.6% in all women,
90.2% in vaccinated women, and 32.2% in unvaccinated
women. All trends were significant except for high-risk, vac-
cine-type HPV in unvaccinated women. Trends differed for
any HPV: there was an overall nonsignificant decline of 4.2%
in all women and 9.7% in vaccinated women, but an overall sig-
nificant increase of 16.7% in unvaccinated women. The propor-
tions of all, vaccinated, and unvaccinated young women across
the study waves who were infected with vaccine-type HPV are
shown graphically in Figure 1, superimposed on the proportion
who were vaccinated.
The results of logistic regression models comparing the pro-
portions of women infected with vaccine-type, high-risk vac-
cine-type, and any HPV in wave 2 versus wave 1 and wave 3
versus wave 1, unadjusted and adjusted for propensity scores,
are shown in Table 3. The decrease in vaccine-type and high-
risk vaccine-type HPV was significant from wave 1 to wave 2
for all, vaccinated, and unvaccinated women in adjusted mod-
els. The decrease in vaccine-type HPV from wave 1 to wave 3
was significant for all, vaccinated, and unvaccinated women,
and the decrease in high-risk vaccine-type HPV was significant
for all and for vaccinated (but not unvaccinated) women in ad-
justed models. The only significant change in any HPV from
wave 1 to wave 3 was an increase in any HPV among unvacci-
nated women.
DISCUSSION
In this study, we identified important early indicators of the
positive public health impact of HPV vaccine introduction
among women in a real-world setting: a significant decrease
in vaccine-type HPV in vaccinated women, and a significant de-
crease in vaccine-type HPV in unvaccinated women, indicating
herd protection [10]. The finding that of no change in the prev-
alence of any HPV infection from wave 1 to wave 3 among all
women and vaccinated women, and of a significant increase in
any HPV among unvaccinated women, strongly suggests that
the decrease observed in vaccine-type HPV was due to vaccine
introduction rather than unmeasured confounding factors. The
impact of HPV vaccine introduction on invasive cervical cancer
and other cancers will not be apparent for decades. Measuring
HPV infection using type-specific HPV DNA tests to monitor
the impact of vaccine introduction is advantageous because
(1) it is the earliest and most direct way to measure vaccine
effectiveness, (2) it is largely independent of interobserver
variation, (3) effects on the prevalence of high-risk vaccine
types (eg, HPV-16 and HPV-18) are clinically significant
because these 2 types cause most HPV-related cancers, and
(4) herd protection can be assessed [10, 26].
Defining the impact of vaccine introduction on HPV preva-
lence has significant implications for clinical practice (eg, for fu-
ture cervical cancer screening recommendations) and public

 health practice (eg, for the design of effective communication
strategies). Determining the herd-protective effects of HPV vac-
cines is important not only because it provides key information
about the total health impact of vaccination but also because it
provides necessary data to assess vaccine cost-effectiveness [27].
Phase 3 randomized trials to assess vaccine efficacy, which were
used to provide the evidence needed for vaccine licensure, are
designed to measure only direct vaccine protection. Only post-
licensure studies in diverse populations can provide evidence of
vaccine effectiveness and herd-protective effects at a communi-
ty level [26].
These data provide insight into the outcomes of HPV vacci-
nation among young women at relatively high risk for HPV in-
fection and its sequelae, because participants in this study were
sexually experienced, >80% reported ≥2 lifetime male sexual
partners, and most reported inconsistent condom use, all risk
factors for HPV infection. The data also provide evidence re-
garding the expected health impact of vaccination among
young women in the catch-up age group for vaccination, age
13–26 years [28].
We found that during the first 8 years after HPV vaccine in-
troduction, vaccine-type HPV prevalence decreased in this
study population by 75% among all women and by 90.8%
among vaccinated women. The effectiveness in vaccinated
women was only slightly lower than that demonstrated in clin-
ical trials. These findings are particularly notable given that the
young women in this study were sexually experienced and many
had been exposed to vaccine-type HPV before vaccination and
because vaccination status was defined as having received only 1
HPV vaccine dose. Differences in vaccine-type HPV rates be-
tween waves 1 and 2, and between waves 1 and 3, were statisti-
cally significant when adjusted for differences in participant
characteristics between the 3 study groups.
Given that HPV-16 and HPV-18 cause approximately 70% of
cervical and 90% of anal cancers [29–31], the decline in vac-
cine-type HPV suggests that HPV vaccine introduction will ul-
timately lead to substantial decreases in cervical cancer rates in
this community. Our results from the first 2 waves of data col-
lection (before and after vaccine introduction) are consistent
with a recent systematic review and meta-analysis by Drolet
et al [4], which examined data comparing HPV prevalence at
2 time points, before and after vaccine introduction, in real-
world settings across 9 countries [14, 32–37] and 2 additional
studies in Sweden and Australia [13, 38]. The meta-analysis
demonstrated that the prevalence of HPV-16/18 decreased sig-
nificantly after vaccine introduction in girls and young women
aged 13–19 years; in countries with high vaccination coverage,

HPV Prevalence After Vaccine Introduction • CID 2016:63 (15 November) • 1285

 HPV-16/18 infection decreased by 64%. Similarly, a recent
US study reported a 64% decline in vaccine-type HPV among
14–19-year-old and a 24% decline among 20–24-year-old
women [39].
Our third wave of data collection demonstrated a further de-
cline in vaccine-type HPV. Meta-analysis results demonstrated
that there was consistency in the magnitude of HPV decline be-
tween countries with similar vaccine coverage rates. Results
from the meta-analysis and subsequent studies suggest that
rates of HPV decline across countries are likely to be driven
by factors such as the age of the women tested, overall vaccina-
tion coverage, years since vaccination, and type of HPV vaccine
administered. The relatively high rate of vaccine coverage
among the participants in our study (71%), which is higher
than vaccine coverage for adolescents in Ohio (61%) [40],
may account in part for the high rates of decline in HPV prev-
alence. Finally, 1 study included examined trends in high-grade
precancerous cervical lesions; a significant decrease in these le-
sions was noted for adolescents [41]. These data suggest, as ex-
pected, that decreases in HPV infection will ultimately translate
into a decrease in cervical precancers and cancers.
The decline in vaccine-type HPV prevalence in unvaccinated
young women was not as striking as in vaccinated young
women, as anticipated. Prevalence decreased by 46.5% in un-
vaccinated young women from wave 1 to wave 2 but increased
by 26.4% from wave 2 to wave 3. However, the overall decline of
32.3% from wave 1 to wave 3 was still statistically significant
when models were adjusted for differences in participant char-
acteristics between the 3 study groups, providing evidence for
herd protection. Regardless, these data underscore the impor-
tance of vaccinating against HPV as the optimal prevention
strategy, and not relying on herd protection for immunity. In
the meta-analysis previously mentioned, results also suggested
herd protection in countries with high vaccination coverage, as
evidenced by a decrease in anogenital warts in men and in older
women who had not been vaccinated [4].
This study has a number of strengths compared with similar
studies. We assessed vaccination by medical record report, an
important indicator of validity as self-reported vaccination
rates are often incorrect in adolescents and young adults [42,
43]. The prevalence of vaccine-type HPV was relatively high
in this study population, resulting in increased power to detect
changes in these types over time. We addressed the significant
potential for selection bias in surveillance studies by addressing
multiple covariates that may be related to HPV infection and by
using propensity score analysis to correct for measured con-
founding associated with selection factors. Finally, we assessed
HPV prevalence at 3 time points over an 8-year period, extend-
ing the results of previous studies.
The study also has several limitations. We recruited from 3
clinical sites, and one potential weakness of this design is lack
of generalizability, with the absolute prevalence rates less likely
to be generalizable than comparisons between recruitment
waves. Another potential weakness is selection bias. However,
these clinical sites probably represent valid sampling systems,
because we selected representative individuals from a popula-
tion that was stable over the time period with respect to the so-
ciodemographic distribution of patients as well as the clinics’
geographic catchment areas. Selection bias was also reduced be-
cause we recruited a sequential sample, participation rates were
high, and recruitment methods were identical across studies. Fi-
nally, there may be unmeasured differences in participant char-
acteristics across study waves that could be related to changes in
HPV prevalence. Ongoing analyses will examine trends in non–
vaccine-type HPV, to evaluate for type replacement and for
cross-protection against types not targeted by the quadrivalent
vaccine.
In conclusion, during the first 8 years after HPV vaccine in-
troduction, the prevalence of vaccine-type HPV decreased by
>90% in vaccinated young women, demonstrating high effec-
tiveness in a community setting even in sexually experienced
young women who may have already been exposed to HPV. Al-
though long-term surveillance will be important to assess for
declining effectiveness over time, the results of this and other
studies suggest that vaccination programs could have a substan-
tial population-level impact on rates of HPV-related cancers.
