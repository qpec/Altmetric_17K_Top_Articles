Disease Course of Lower Respiratory Tract Infection 
With a Bacterial Cause 
ABSTRACT
PURPOSE Bacterial pathogens are assumed to cause an illness course different 
from that of nonbacterial causes of acute cough, but evidence is lacking. We 
evaluated the disease course of lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) with a 
bacterial cause in adults with acute cough.
METHODS We conducted a secondary analysis of a multicenter European trial in 
which 2,061 adults with acute cough (28 days’ duration or less) were recruited 
from primary care and randomized to amoxicillin or placebo. For this analysis 
only patients in the placebo group (n 
= 
1,021) were included, reflecting the natu-
ral course of disease. Standardized microbiological and serological analyses were 
performed at baseline to define a bacterial cause. All patients recorded symp-
toms in a diary for 4 weeks. The disease course between those with and without 
a bacterial cause was compared by symptom severity in days 2 to 4, duration of 
symptoms rated moderately bad or worse, and a return consultation.
RESULTS Of 1,021 eligible patients, 187 were excluded for missing diary records, 
leaving 834 patients, of whom 162 had bacterial LRTI. Patients with bacterial 
LRTI had worse symptoms at day 2 to 4 after the first office visit (P 
= 
.014) and 
returned more often for a second consultation, 27% vs 17%, than those without 
bacterial LRTI (P 
= 
.004). Resolution of symptoms rated moderately bad or worse 
did not differ (P 
= 
.375).
CONCLUSIONS Patients with acute bacterial LRTI have a slightly worse course of 
disease when compared with those without an identified bacterial cause, but the 
relevance of this difference is not meaningful.

INTRODUCTION
L
ower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) are among the most com-
mon reasons for consulting in primary care,1 and physicians usually 
treat LRTI empirically based on clinical assessment without micro-
biological testing for the causal pathogen. Bacterial pathogens are often 
assumed to result in a different illness course than nonbacterial causes 
of acute cough, but knowledge of actual difference is lacking. In the few 
studies where potential pathogens have been systematically isolated from 
primary care patients with LRTI, a bacterial pathogen was identified in 
19% to 43% of patients.1-4 Difference in illness course, however, was not 
evaluated in these studies. Knowledge of actual illness course of bacte-
rial LRTI compared with other LRTIs may be helpful in several ways. 
Physicians fear missing bacterial LRTI because they generally assume 
that disease course is more severe and prolonged in these patients and 
prescribe antibiotics as a defensive strategy.5 As many of these antibiotics 
may not benefit patients, cause unwanted effects, and drive antimicrobial 
resistance,6-9 insight into the illness course of bacterial LRTI untreated 
with antibiotics could help guide empirical antibiotic prescribing, support 
a strategy of initial observation (watchful waiting), and help set evidence-
based expectations about the disease course for patients.

The aim of the present study was to describe the 
illness course of patients consulting in primary care 
with LRTI in whom a bacterial pathogen was isolated, 
and to compare their illness course with that of LRTI 
patients with no bacterial pathogen.
METHODS
Design and Study Population
This study was based on a secondary analysis of a 
randomized, placebo-controlled trial of amoxicillin 
for LRTI in 16 primary care networks in 12 European 
countries from October 2007 until April 2010. More 
details on this GRACE-10 study (Genomics to combat 
Resistance against Antibiotics in Community-acquired 
LRTI in Europe) have been reported elsewhere.10 
Recruited networks had access to a minimum of 20,000 
patients. Because LRTIs are common, many more 
eligible patients consulted their clinicians during the 
recruitment period than were invited to participate 
in this study. As a result, we did not achieve the goal 
of recruiting all consecutive, eligible patients. Never-
theless, we assume that this study sample resulted in 
limited selection bias, because participating clinicians 
reported that the main reason not to include all eligible 
patients was time constraint.11 Moreover, we found no 
relevant differences in patient characteristics compared 
with the observational study of Butler et al,6 done ear-
lier in the same recruiting network. 
Eligible patients were aged 18 years and older who 
consulted their physician for the first time with an 
acute cough (duration of 28 days or less) as the main 
symptom or where cough was not the most prominent 
symptom, but the physician considered an acute LRTI 
as the main diagnosis. Exclusion criteria were clini-
cally suspected pneumonia12 based on focal chest signs 
(focal crepitation and bronchial breathing) and sys-
temic features (high fever, vomiting, severe diarrhea), 
pregnancy, allergy to penicillin, treatment with anti-
biotics in the previous month, and immunodeficiency 
disorder. Additionally, patients allocated to amoxicillin 
or patients who did not return their follow-up diary 
were excluded. The study was approved by ethics 
committees in all participating countries, and all par-
ticipants provided written informed consent.
Measurements
Symptoms
Physicians recorded patients’ clinical signs and comor-
bidities on a case report form. They also recorded 14 
baseline symptoms (cough, phlegm, shortness of breath, 
wheeze, runny nose, fever, chest pain, muscle aching, 
headache, disturbed sleep, feeling generally unwell, 
interference with normal activities/work, confusion/
disorientation, and diarrhea) on a 4-point Likert scale 
that ranged from no problem to severe problem. Base-
line symptom severity was calculated by summing the 
scores of the symptoms and rescaling the scores to make 
them range between 0 and 100. Patients filled in a daily 
symptom diary during their illness for up to 28 days for 
the same symptoms on a 7-point Likert scale that ranged 
from no problem to severe problem. This diary was pre-
viously validated and shown to be sensitive to change.13
Respiratory Sample
A sputum sample from a productive cough (not avail-
able for all) and a nasopharyngeal swab were collected 
from each patient at day 1, before any antibiotic therapy 
was started. Sputa were sent to the local laboratory and 
processed immediately. Direct microscopy, Gram stain, 
and culture were performed according to a standardized 
protocol (Supplemental Appendix 1, http://www.annfa-
mmed.org/content/14/6/534/suppl/DC1). Nasopharyn-
geal swabs, put in Universal Transport Medium (Copan 
Diagnostics) and in skimmed milk medium, were sent to 
the laboratory of the University of Antwerp for bacte-
rial and viral polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis.
Chest Radiograph
All patients underwent chest radiography within 7 days 
of first visit, preferably within 3 days. Pneumonia was 
determined by radiologists, blinded to all other infor-
mation, who judged chest radiographs using a standard 
operating procedure (Supplemental Appendix 2, http://
www.annfammed.org/content/14/6/534/suppl/DC1).11
Definition of Bacterial Infection
Bacterial infection was defined as Streptococcus pneumoniae, 
Haemophilus influenzae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Bordetella 
pertussis, Legionella pneumophila in respiratory samples or 
serological evidence for M pneumoniae infection. Chla-
mydia pneumoniae was not included because its clinical 
relevance is unclear.1,14 S pneumoniae and H influenzae 
infections were considered present when a microorgan-
ism was isolated from sputum (ratio of 1 or more white 
blood cells to epithelial cells as a criterion for good 
quality) or a nasopharyngeal swab. B pertussis infection 
was determined by PCR (from nasopharyngeal swabs) 
and by a ratio of IgG antibodies to pertussis toxin in 
venous blood at day 28. An antibody titer to pertussis 
toxin of 125 IU/mL or greater or a positive PCR result 
in a respiratory sample defined recent B pertussis infec-
tion. M pneumoniae and L pneumophila infections were 
determined by PCR from nasopharyngeal swabs. Sero-
logically definitive M pneumoniae infection was defined as 
IgM antibodies in the sample on day 1 or day 28, or a 
IgG seroconversion or major increase in IgG antibody 
levels between day 1 and day 28.

Antibiotic Use
During follow-up, patients in the placebo group could 
be unblinded and switched to antibiotic treatment 
according to the treating clinicians’ judgments. The 
physicians could then prescribe any antibiotic they 
considered appropriate (including amoxicillin, any 
other penicillin, macrolides, and other). Antibiotic use 
was defined dichotomously (patient reported intake of 
antibiotics of 1 dose or more for at least 5 days in the 
first 10 days after the index physician consultation).
Outcome Measures
Outcomes were duration of symptoms rated by 
patients as moderately bad or worse after the initial 
consultation, symptom severity on days 2 to 4 after 
the index consultation, and worsening illness, defined 
as a return visit to the physician with worsening symp-
toms, new symptoms, new signs, or illness necessitat-
ing admission to hospital within 4 weeks after the first 
consultation.10 In addition, we assessed the effects on 
duration of symptoms until complete resolution and 
duration of interference with normal activities or work.
Data Analysis
The course of bacterial LRTI in adults with acute cough 
was compared with the course of those without bacterial 
LRTI for all 4 outcomes. Data were analyzed using lin-
ear regression models. Simple linear regression was used 
for symptom severity, Cox regression for the duration 
of symptoms allowing for censoring, and logistic regres-
sion for return visits for new or worsened symptoms. In 
the multivariable analyses, we controlled all outcomes 
for the potentially confounding factors of age, current 
smoking, comorbidity (pulmonary, cardiac, diabetes 
mellitus) and cough duration before consultation. Finally, 
we repeated the analysis on all outcomes restricted 
to the patients who did not use antibiotics to mimic 
natural course of bacterial LRTI. Another analysis on 
all outcomes was restricted to those without radiologi-
cally proven pneumonia. We expected that S pneumoniae 
and H influenzae, which are the most common bacteria, 
may have driven the course of disease, so we performed 
2 sensitivity analyses on all outcomes: 1 restricted to 
those without S pneumoniae infection, and 1 restricted to 
those without H influenzae infection. Data were analyzed 
using SPSS 20.0 for Windows (IBM Corp).
RESULTS
There were 1,021 participants randomized to placebo, 
and 834 (82%) returned the diary. The baseline charac-
teristics of these 834 participants were similar to those 
who did not return the diary, except for age (mean age 
51 years [SD = 16 years] vs 43 years [SD = 17 years]) 
(Supplemental Appendix 3, http://www.annfammed.
org/content/14/6/534/suppl/DC ). Bacterial LRTI was 
found in 162 (19%) patients, ranging between 14% and 
26% in all networks. S pneumoniae (56/834, 7%) and H 
influenzae (56/834, 7%) were the most common bacterial 
microorganisms. M pneumoniae, B pertussis, and L pneu-
mophila were found in 40 (5%), 31 (4%), and 1 (0.1%) of 
834 participants, respectively. 
Patients with bacterial LRTI were more frequently 
current smokers (33% vs 24% with nonbacterial LRTI), 
had a longer mean cough duration before the index 
consultation (9 days vs 8 days), had a higher physician-
rated symptom severity score at day 1 (34 vs 30), and 
more often showed infiltrates on their chest radiograph 
(6% vs 3%) (Table 1). Of the 834 eligible participants, 
62 (7%) used antibiotics for at least 5 days in the first

10 days after the index physician consultation. Patients 
who used antibiotics had a higher physician-rated 
symptom severity score at day 1 (36 vs 31) and were 
similar to those who did not use antibiotics in terms of 
mean age (51 years vs 51 years) and comorbidity (31% 
vs 25%) (Supplemental Appendix 4, http://www.annfa-
mmed.org/content/14/6/534/suppl/DC1).
Disease Course
Patients with bacterial LRTI 
had self-rated mean symptom 
severity scores on days 2 to 
4 that were higher than those 
without bacterial LRTI (P = .014) 
and were more likely to make a 
return visit for new or worsening 
symptoms (P = .004) (Table 2). 
Furthermore, excluding patients 
with radiologically proven pneu-
monia (n = 26) did not result in 
different findings between those 
with and without bacterial LRTI 
for all outcomes. Most return 
visits were for new or worsening 
symptoms, and only 2 patients 
required hospital admission (1 
from the bacterial LRTI group 
and 1 from the nonbacterial 
LRTI group) within 4 weeks 
after the first consultation. No 
study-related deaths were noted. 
A Kaplan-Meier curve for the duration of symptoms 
rated moderately bad or worse (Figure 1) showed 
no difference in median and interquartile range of 
symptom duration between patients with and without 
bacterial LRTI: 7 days, interquartile ratio (IQR) = 5-15 
days vs 7 days, IQR = 4-13 days, respectively, for a 
hazard ratio of  0.92 (95% CI, 0.77-1.11; P = .375). The

other outcomes did not differ between those with and 
without bacterial LRTI.
Repeating the analysis restricted to the patients 
who did not use antibiotics (n = 772) showed that only 
a return visit for new or worsening symptoms was dif-
ferent between patients with and without bacterial 
LRTI, 23% (33 of 42) vs 16% (97 of 619) respectively,  
(OR = 1.67; 95% CI, 1.06-2.63; P = .029) (data not 
shown in tables). Repeating the analysis restricted to 
those patients without S pneumoniae infection (n = 778), 
did not result in different findings. Finally, repeating 
the analysis restricted to those patients without H 
influenzae infection (n = 778) showed no differences in 
course of disease between those with and without bac-
terial LRTI for all outcomes.
DISCUSSION
Main Findings
We found that adult patients who consulted for acute 
cough in primary care and who had a bacterial patho-
gen isolated had a slightly worse illness course com-
pared with patients in whom no bacterial pathogen was 
isolated. The difference is small, however, and clini-
cally not meaningful.
Strengths and Limitations
As far as we are aware, this study is the first to 
describe the illness course of a bacterial LRTI in a 
large study population in primary care. Moreover, the 
study population was initially not treated with anti-
biotics, and only a small number of the patients (7%) 
were subsequently prescribed antibiotics for their ill-
ness episode. As a result, we are able to describe the 
illness course of bacterial LRTI and assess to what 
extent it differed from other LRTIs.
One limitation is that more severely ill patients 
who were immediately referred to a hospital were 
not included in this study. The severity of our group 
of patients with bacterial LRTI might be milder than 
in the general population, and therefore the course 
of disease is probably not generalizable to sicker 
patients. Knowledge of the prognosis of bacterial 
LRTI among severely ill patients, however, will not 
change management, since those with severe bacterial 
LRTI still require antibiotic treatment and/or admis-
sion to hospital. It should be kept in mind that some 
patients with initially mild symptoms subsequently do 
require hospitalization. In our study, however, only 2 
patients (1 from the bacterial LRTI group and 1 from 
the nonbacterial LRTI group) were admitted (not 
immediately) to hospital.
Another possible limitation is misclassification of 
bacterial LRTI by airway bacterial colonization. We 
expect this misclassification is limited, because coloni-
zation of the lower airways is not likely in symptomatic 
ambulatory outpatients. In studies where H influenzae 
and S pneumoniae have been identified by conventional 
methods in healthy individuals, colonization was esti-
mated maximally at 10%.15,16 Moreover, in our study, 
the proportion of patients with chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease (COPD), in whom airways can be 
colonized with H influenzae17 in severe COPD, was small 
(5%, 45 of 834).
Finally, it was not possible to report the full disease 
course in 7% (59 of 833) of the patients, because these 
patients still reported moderately bad or worse symp-
toms at day 28.
Comparison with Existing Literature
The prevalence of patients with bacterial LRTI and 
radiographic evidence of pneumonia (1.1%, 9 of 834) in 
this study is lower than the 5.9% (14 of 236) reported 
in a study from Hopstaken et al.18 The higher propor-
tion of bacterial pneumonia in that study could be 
explained by difference in eligibility criteria. Regard-
ing return visits, (27% in our study) Macfarlane et al 
reported 21% (28 of 135) return visits for the same ill-
ness in LRTI within a month.1
Implications for Practice
Because the illness course of bacterial LRTI is generally 
mild, uncomplicated, and similar to that of nonbacterial 
LRTI, physicians can reassure patients that LRTI, even 
if bacterial, is a self-limiting condition, and that rather 
than immediately prescribing an antibiotic, a strategy 
of watchful waiting should be considered.
