United States National Postdoc
Survey results and the
interaction of gender, career
choice and mentor impact
Abstract The postdoctoral community is an essential component of the academic and scientific workforce, but a
lack of data about this community has made it difficult to develop policies to address concerns about salaries,
working conditions, diversity and career development, and to evaluate the impact of existing policies. Here we
present comprehensive survey results from 7,603 postdocs based at 351 US academic and non-academic (e.g.
hospital, industry and government lab) institutions in 2016. In addition to demographic and salary information, we
present multivariate analyses on factors influencing postdoc career plans and satisfaction with mentorship. We
further analyze gender dynamics and expose wage disparities. Academic research positions remain the
predominant career choice, although women and US citizens are less likely than their male and non-US citizen
counterparts to choose academic research positions. Receiving mentorship training has a significant positive effect
on postdoc satisfaction with mentorship. Quality of and satisfaction with postdoc mentorship also appear to
heavily influence career choice.

Introduction
Postdoctoral training offers doctoral recipients a
temporary
period
of
mentored
or
scholarly
experience, considered highly productive within
scientific and academic communities. Such train-
ing is also ostensibly valuable for postdocs, who
gain additional experience to help pursue their
chosen career paths. Tenure-track faculty posi-
tions, however, are now estimated to represent
a small percentage of postdoc career outcomes
(~15%) (Larson et al., 2014; National Academy
of Sciences, 2014). This has led to proposals
that support training postdocs for additional
roles
beyond
tenure-track
faculty
positions.
Additional efforts by the National Institutes of
Health
(NIH),
National
Science
Foundation
(NSF), and National Academies of Sciences,
Engineering, and Medicine also aim to increase
mentor accountability (National Academy of
Sciences, 2014; Institute of Medicine, 2000;
The National Academies of Sciences, 2018;
National
Institutes
of
Health,
2012;
Meyers et al., 2016). Persistent concerns with
increasingly long periods of postdoctoral train-
ing, lack of appropriate career guidance beyond
the professoriate, and comparatively low post-
doctoral salaries have also led to repeated calls
to
reform
the
postdoctoral
training
model
(National Research Council, 1969; Davis, 2005;
Sauermann and Roach, 2016; Alberts et al.,
2014; Gould, 2015; Schaller et al., 2017).
Despite these concerns, comprehensive data
for
postdocs
are
not
routinely
collected
(The National Academies of Sciences, 2018).
Indeed, reliable data on such basic information
as the number of postdocs have been lacking, or
disputed, in part due to the difficulties that a
lack of job title standardization, postdoc mobil-
ity,
and
the
ad
hoc
nature
of

lection efforts (National Academy of Sciences,
2014; National Institutes of Health, 2012;
Schaller
et
al.,
2017;
Daniels,
2015;
Pickett et al., 2017).
Possibly for these very reasons, the postdoc-
toral experience has not been comprehensively
surveyed nationally in over a decade, following
the Sigma Xi ‘Doctors without orders’ survey
report in 2005, which was based on postdoc
respondents from 46 participating institutions
(Davis, 2005). Nevertheless, recent data collec-
tion efforts have provided insights into the post-
doctoral
experience
(National
Institutes
of
Health, 2012; Sauermann and Roach, 2016;
Pickett et al., 2017; Heggeness et al., 2016;
Gibbs et al., 2015; Ferguson et al., 2014;
Phou, 2017; Kahn and Ginther, 2017). For
example, the pilot phase of the NSF Early Career
Doctorates Survey studied the breadth of the
doctoral population at US academic institutions,
including postdoctoral researchers, early career
faculty, and scientists in non-postdoctoral posi-
tions such as staff scientist or administrative
positions (Phou, 2017). Most of their respond-
ents were full-time faculty (54%); only 31% of
respondents were postdocs.
Comprehensive survey data that specifically
targets the postdoctoral period and includes
postdoctoral
researchers
with
PhDs
granted
both inside and outside the US, and data
regarding postdoc career plans, satisfaction with
mentorship, or family demographics, are still
largely lacking (National Academy of Sciences,
2014; The National Academies of Sciences,
2018). To address these gaps, and to research
those postdocs who do not have clear institu-
tional oversight, we took a grass-roots approach
to conduct a postdoc-led survey of US postdoc-
toral
researchers.
We
asked
postdoctoral
researchers a number of questions associated
with professional and career development, men-
toring,
career
choice,
lifestyle,
and
demo-
graphics (for details see Materials and Methods
and Source Data 1-3). The purpose of this work
was to capture a comprehensive snapshot of the
postdoctoral experience in a manner that was
both broad and informative, with high diversity
in the questions and topics covered, in the num-
ber and type of institutions where the postdoc-
toral researchers are based, and in the breadth
of postdoctoral experiences included.
Results and Discussion
To collect data from institutions with a wide
range of support for postdocs, we took a multi-
level approach to recruit survey participants. We
used publicly available contact information for
university leadership, postdoctoral administra-
tors, postdoctoral societies and associations,
and asked these individuals in leadership posi-
tions to disseminate our survey to all postdocs
at their institutions. In total, we contacted indi-
viduals at the 482 US institutions most likely to
have postdocs, including universities, research
institutions, museums and government labs. We
obtained respondents from 351 institutions. In
addition to direct contact with institutions, we
also used a grass-roots survey dissemination
approach, promoted a website describing the
survey that could be freely shared on social
media and by email, and contacted professional
societies to encourage survey dissemination.
Using these combined approaches, we collected
7,673 individual responses into a secure REDCap
database
(IRB
Protocol
Number
15–1724),
which, after quality control to remove respond-
ents from non-US institutions, provided a final
dataset of 7,603 respondents (see Materials and
Methods for details).
As one of our goals was to reach as many
postdocs as possible, survey dissemination was
not
randomized
to
any
specific
subset.
Responses from institutions with long-standing
postdoctoral affairs offices were anticipated to
be over-represented in our dataset (see Materi-
als and Methods for more information). Never-
theless, our respondents represented all 50
states, including a large fraction of respondents
from institutions without well-established offices
for postdoctoral support. While the majority of
respondents
represented
STEM
disciplines,
which traditionally employ the most postdocs,
8.4% reported their primary fields as humanities,
psychology
or
social
sciences
(Supplementary file 1 (Table S3)).
Our postdoc respondents were 49% US citi-
zens and 51% non-US citizens (Figure 1 and
Supplementary file 1 (Table S2)). The majority
were 30–34 years of age (54.5%), and 1–3 years
from receipt of their doctorate (63.1%), match-
ing their reported years of postdoctoral experi-
ence (Figure 1 and Supplementary file 1 (Table
S2)). The majority of postdoc respondents (69%)
were from R1 academic institutions (Carnegie
classification), with the remainder from non-R1

 academic
institutions
(16%),
medical
centers
(10%), and national government laboratories
(4%). Less than 1% were either self- or otherwise
employed. Of the 6,476 postdoc respondents in
academia, 57% were based at public institutions
while 43% were at private institutions. While the
majority of postdocs were from R1 institutions, a
large number of both R1 and non-R1 institutions
were represented in our data set. Respondents
were based at 151 different R1 institutions, 135
non-R1 academic institutions, 42 medical cen-
ters, and 59 national government laboratories.
The Carnegie classification of non-R1 academic
institution includes a wide range of academic
institutions, from medical and PhD degree grant-
ing institutions that do not qualify as R1, to lib-
eral
arts
and
historically
minority
serving
institutions. Due to the relatively small percent-
age of postdoc respondents from the large num-
ber of non-R1 institutions represented in our
data set, we did not parse this group further,
though future work should assess whether post-
docs at liberal arts and minority serving institutes
have unique experiences relative to postdocs
based at other non-R1 academic institutions.

 A majority of respondents (55%) described
their primary field of study as life sciences. There
were small, but significant, differences in primary
field
by

were 53% female, while the gender ratio of their
mentors was skewed towards males (71% male;

Gender Equity report where full-time faculty are
majority (61%) male (Association of American

United States National Postdoc Survey results and the interaction of gender, career choice and mentor impact
 response bias remains difficult as there are cur-
rently no gold-standard datasets of postdocs in
the US for comparison, due to the previously
mentioned broader lack of oversight and bar-
riers to reaching postdocs. That being said, the
unique characteristics of our dataset, including
approximately equal representation (similar sam-
ple sizes) of men and women, as well as US citi-
zens
and
non-US
citizens,
facilitated
our
comparative analyses of the postdoctoral experi-
ences of these different groups, which we report
below.
Our data indicate that gender has a signifi-
cant effect on the postdoc experience (Figure 1).
Men were paid more than women (Male aver-
age: $47,678.00, Female average: $46,477.43,
n = 7,516, c2 = 62.337, p < 0.0001. Note that
our survey answer
options
were
categorical
instead of continuous, thus Pearson c2 tests and
nominal logistic regression models were used
instead
of
ANOVAs
and
generalized
linear
regression models throughout the manuscript).
Men were more likely to have a same-gender
mentor, i.e. a same-gender role model (Male:
77.3%, Female: 35.4%, n = 7,459, c2 = 144.352,
p < 0.0001). Men were more likely to be non-US
citizens (Male: 42% US citizens, 52% temporary
visas, 6% permanent residents; Female: 56% US
citizens, 38% temporary visas, 6% permanent
residents; n = 7,543, c2 = 169.709, p < 0.0001).
In addition, a small but significantly higher pro-
portion of male postdocs were married/part-
nered (Male: 68.3%, Female: 63.2%, n = 7,538,
c2 = 21.693, p < 0.0001) and/or have children
(Male:
31.0%,
Female:
22.3%,
n
=
7,532,
c2 = 71.561, p < 0.0001).
The gender disparity in pay was present even
after male and female postdocs were matched
in age, years since graduation, self-identification
as white/Caucasian or other, satisfaction with
mentorship, Carnegie classification of institution,
public or private control of institution, whether
married/partnered, or having children (nominal

=

c2
=

(Table
S4)).
In
other
words, female postdocs earned less than male
postdocs, regardless of type of institution, mari-
tal status, parental status, or majority/minority
status. This gender wage gap increased with
postdoc age but not with partnership status,
partially supporting previous analyses of the
STEM gender wage gap (Association of Ameri-
can
University
Professors,
2006;
Athanasiadou et al., 2018).
Primary field of study was excluded from this
analysis because field has such a large effect on
salary, overshadowing most other factors, with
postdocs in Engineering, Environmental Scien-
ces, the Physical Sciences, and the Social Scien-
ces
earning
significantly
more
money
than
postdocs in the Life Sciences, Humanities, Medi-
cine,
or
Psychology
(n
=
7,542,
750.452,
p < 0.0001; Supplementary file 1 (Table S5)).
Carnegie classification also had a large effect on
salary (Supplementary file 1 (Table S4)), as 58%
of the postdocs at national government labora-
tories report earning more than $55,000 a year,
while only 8% of postdocs at R1 institutions
report earning more than $55,000 a year. Male
postdocs were more likely than women to be in
the primary fields of Engineering (n = 620,
c2 = 76.652, p < 0.0001) or Physical Sciences
(n = 846, c2 = 77.466, p < 0.0001), two fields
which
have
historically
higher
salaries
(Buffington et al., 2016). Interestingly, female
postdocs trended towards being paid less than
men in all fields except the Physical Sciences,
where
women
trended
towards
being
paid
slightly more than men (Supplementary file 1
(Table S5)). Income, mentor gender, citizenship,
and partner status are all factors that may con-
tribute to the observed gender difference in
interest in primarily research-focused academic
careers (Buffington et al., 2016) (Figures 1 and
3H).
Most postdocs reported salaries in the range
of
$39,000–$55,000
(median
$43,750,
mean
$46,988, n = 7,551). In the 2014 National Post-
doctoral Association’s Institutional Policy Report,
52% of the 74 institutions reported that their
minimum
stipend
matched
the
current
NIH
NRSA minimum (Ferguson et al., 2014). At the
time
of
this
survey,
the
NIH
minimum was $43,692 (National Institutes of
Health, 2018), which matches well with $43,750,
the reported median income in our study, as
well as the median postdoc income reported in
recent
work
by
McDowell
et
al.
(McDowell et al., 2018). Five percent of post-
docs reported mean gross incomes of less than
$39,000 and ~10% reported incomes above
$55,000. Although salaries in high cost of living
(COL) urban areas tend to be higher than aver-
age (Supplementary file 1 (Table S6)), when
adjusted to publicly available COL data, post-
docs in large metropolitan areas earn signifi-
cantly less money than postdocs in college
towns or rural settings (average salary when
adjusted

report recommended as a best practice that the
minimum
salary
be
set
at
$50,000 (National Academy of Sciences, 2014);
however, this has not been enacted at most
institutions, and was only enacted by the NIH in
November 2018. During the months that our
survey was open (February–September 2016),
the effect of a proposed minimum salary update
($47,476) to the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA)
on postdoctoral salaries was openly debated,
but ultimately not federally mandated (Bend-
erly, 2016). Our data suggest that setting a min-
imum
salary
for
postdocs
is
particularly
important for postdoctoral researchers in large

 metropolitan areas, where salaries are not main-
taining parity with cost of living increases.
The majority of postdocs selected research-
focused academic careers as their primary long-
term career plan (57.7%), with industry research
a
distant
second
(17.8%;
Figure
1J;
Supplementary file 1 (Table S2)). Determining
the ‘why’ of career choice remains the subject of
much study (National Academy of Sciences,
2014; The National Academies of Sciences,
2018; National Institutes of Health, 2012;
Hayter and Parker, 2018; Roach and Sauer-
mann, 2017). To assess which factors were most
influential for determining postdoc career plan
in our dataset (categorized in this survey as: aca-
demia, primarily research based; academia, pri-
marily teaching based; industry; government/
non-profit; other) we conducted a nominal logis-
tic regression model with 26 factors concerning
topics considered to be important for postdoc
success and career choice (Supplementary file 1
(Table S7)), which include demographics, train-
ing, productivity and mentor support matrices.
The 14 significant factors in the model were (in
order of effect size): 1) whether postdoc career
plans had changed; 2) whether the postdoc
received training in pedagogy; 3) feelings of
career preparedness; 4) perceived support of
career plan from mentors; 5) primary field of
study; 6) residency status in the US; 7) intensity
of job search; 8) postdoc gender; 9) number of
first, last, or corresponding author publications;
10) number of conferences attended in the past
year; 11) hours worked per week; 12) total num-
ber of publications while a postdoc; 13) mentor
rank; and 14) desire to pursue a career in the US
(Table 1).
Perceived mentor support, number of post-
doc publications, hours worked per week, con-
ferences
attended,
and
postdoc
feelings
of
career preparedness were all positively corre-
lated with a choice to pursue a research-focused
academic career (Figure 3A,B,D–F; Figure 3—
figure supplement 1C). Male postdocs, and
postdocs who were not US citizens, were more
interested
in
academic
research
positions
(Figure 3G and H). In contrast, postdocs with
mentors outside of the professoriate were more
likely to prefer government/non-profit positions
(Figure 3—figure supplement 1A). Whether
this is a cause or effect relationship is not clear
from our study, though we did find that post-
docs with non-academic mentors changed their
career plans at the same rate as those with aca-
demic
mentors
(n
=
7,361,
c2
=
6.860,
p = 0.077). In addition, postdocs actively search-
ing for permanent positions were less interested
in academic research than postdocs not yet on
the job market (Figure 3—figure supplement
1B), and were more likely to have changed their
career
plans
(n
=
7,565,
c2
=
224.633,
p < 0.0001). These results complement recent

United States National Postdoc Survey results and the interaction of gender, career choice and mentor impact
 studies suggesting that individual career choice
is influenced by changing job attribute preferen-
ces
and
self-awareness
(Buffington
et
al.,
2016), and that academic success is influenced
by mentorship during the postdoctoral period
(Lienard et al., 2018).
Sixty percent of respondents were either sat-
isfied or very satisfied with the mentorship they
receive, with similar responses from both gen-
ders (Figure 1I). To assess which factors were
most influential for determining satisfaction with
their postdoc mentor, we conducted a nominal
logistic regression model with the same 26 fac-
tors included in the model for postdoc career
choice (though excluding satisfaction with men-
torship as a factor, and replacing it with postdoc
long-term career plan; Supplementary file 1
(Table S7)). The eight significant factors in the
model (in order of effect size) were: 1) feelings
of career preparedness; 2) perceived support of
career plan from mentors; 3) frequency of proj-
ect meetings with mentor; 4) intensity of job
search; 5) whether the postdoc received training
in mentorship; 6) primary field of study; 7) per-
ception of job market; and 8) academic rank of
mentor (Table 2). These factors were more
important than number of postdoc publications,
whether a postdoc had changed career plans,
postdoc or mentor gender, residency status, or
postdoc
training
in
either
grant
writing
or
pedagogy.
Perceived mentor support had a positive
effect on how satisfied a postdoc is with their
mentor, as did frequency of mentor meetings,
perception of preparedness for desired future
career,
and
perception
of
job
market
(Figure 4A–D). Postdocs who received training
in mentorship were more satisfied with the men-
torship they received than postdocs who did not
receive training in mentorship (Figure 4E). We
found this to be particularly noteworthy, as men-
torship training is not a common part of the
postdoctoral experience, with only 26% of post-
docs reporting that they have received such
training. While we cannot comment further on
the specific type of mentor training that postdoc
respondents received, we note that several insti-
tutions in our study have mentor training pro-
grams for postdocs in place, including those that
use curricula from the University of Wisconsin-
Madison Center for the Improvement of Men-
tored Experiences in Research (CIMER) project
and/or National Research Mentoring Network
(NRMN),

on
a
postdoc
cohort
showed that high satisfaction with mentorship
and perceived support correlated with increased
interest in an academic research focused career
(Scaffidi and Berman, 2011). In addition, in a
randomized, controlled study, a different type of
mentoring, ‘group career coaching,’ where a
career coach works with small groups of gradu-
ate students to provide support and promote
career progress, was found to increase both per-
ceived ‘achievability’ and ‘desirability’ of aca-
demic careers in an under-represented minority
student group (Williams et al., 2016). Thirdly, in
a longitudinal study of PhD students interested
in academic careers, their perceived ability, or
self-efficacy, was a strong indicator of retaining
interest in a faculty career (Roach and Sauer-
mann, 2017).

 Other studies suggest that in addition to
structured oversight and professional develop-
ment (Davis, 2009), provision of research men-
tor training improves the success of researchers-
in-training at all levels (Fleming et al., 2012).
These studies strongly suggest that increasing a
graduate student or postdoc’s self confidence
and self-efficacy increases interest in an aca-
demic faculty career. Self-efficacy is directly
impacted
by
the
primary
mentor
and
may
explain the correlation between perceived sup-
port from their mentor and a postdoc’s interest
in a faculty career seen here and elsewhere
(Scaffidi and Berman, 2011). While our data do
not show a significant correlation between gen-
der and satisfaction with their mentor, they do
suggest that an increase in mentor support and
mentorship training will increase a postdoc’s
interest in academic jobs. This increase in men-
tor
support
and
mentorship
may
be
a
particularly important tool for increasing female
and
under-represented
postdocs’
pursuit
of
research-intensive academic careers.
Conclusions
In summary, our dataset represents the most
comprehensive survey of the US postdoctoral
population in over a decade. As such, these data
may provide a benchmark for legislation and
institutional policy makers, inform research ques-
tions pertaining to the evolving postdoctoral
population, and serve as a precedent for under-
standing the important dynamics of the scientific
workforce.
We found that a research-focused academic
position remains the most common primary
career goal for postdocs, in spite of increasing
emphasis on other types of careers for doctorate
holders (The National Academies of Sciences,
2018; Alberts et al., 2014; St Clair et al.,

United States National Postdoc Survey results and the interaction of gender, career choice and mentor impact
 2017). Although 60% of respondents were satis-
fied with the mentoring that they receive, our
data suggest that providing formal mentorship
training for postdocs may significantly increase
their satisfaction with their mentor and influence
career choice (Williams et al., 2016). Our data
also show that women are less interested in
research-focused academic positions than men,
and this may be associated with gender specific
differences in postdoctoral experiences (Moss-
Racusin et al., 2012).
While the data we collected allowed us to
identify a number of factors influencing the post-
doctoral
experience,
other
factors,
such
as
socioeconomic
background
and
underrepre-
sented status, may also play a significant role,
and should be studied further. Nevertheless, our
findings
highlight
the
impact
of
mentoring,
across all demographics, as essential to inform-
ing career choice and determining quality of
postdoctoral experience.
Materials and Methods
Survey instrument design
The National Postdoc Survey questions were
designed to emphasize aspects of the postdoc-
toral experience related to career choice and
mentoring, in addition to collecting basic demo-
graphic data. These questions were based on
over a decade of experience with postdoctoral
surveys administered at the University of Chi-
cago, led by postdocs within the Biological Sci-
ences Division Postdoctoral Association. In an
effort to maximize participation for all postdocs,
regardless of institutional environment, we dis-
seminated the survey using top-down and grass-
roots methods described below.
We conducted the survey in two phases: a
15-institution pilot phase, followed by a national
rollout to over 450 institutions. The pilot phase
was launched on February 2, 2016 after contact-
ing and inviting participation from administrators
at the 15 member schools of the Committee on
Institutional Cooperation (CIC, now the Big Ten
Academic Alliance plus the University of Chi-
cago). 272 postdocs participated in the pilot
phase of the survey. Feedback about the survey
design was solicited during a workshop about
the survey presented at the National Postdoc
Association Annual meeting on March 4, 2016.
The pilot survey questions (Source Data 1) were
then slightly modified before nationwide launch
on March 31, 2016. These revisions included
additional
demographic
questions,
and
rephrasing of several questions to improve clar-
ity (Source Data 2 and Source Data 3). The
revised survey was available from March 31–Sep-
tember 2, 2016. While the CIC institutions par-
ticipated in the pilot version of this survey, the
survey was also open to postdocs at CIC institu-
tions after the national rollout. A majority of par-
ticipants from CIC institutions responded after
March 31, 2016 and took the final version of the
survey rather than the pilot version.
For
the
top-down
survey
dissemination
approach, a team of five postdocs and two
administrators compiled contacts for all doctoral
degree and research institutions in the US that
were thought to have postdoctoral researchers.
We gathered publicly available contact informa-
tion for Postdoctoral Offices, Postdoctoral Asso-
ciations, as well as Offices of Research, Deans of
Graduate
Schools,
Provosts
and
any
other
administrators that may represent postdocs for
each
institution
(including
website,
email
addresses and names) via web search. Whenever
an institution did not have a postdoctoral office,
we tried to determine who had oversight of
postdoctoral researchers, such as a representa-
tive
from
an
Office
of
Research,
Graduate
School, or a Provost Office. We used this infor-
mation to simultaneously contact those who we
determined were most likely to represent post-
docs at each university, including any listed post-
doc contacts. Multi-respondent emails were sent
to the above described representatives at each
institution. These individuals were again invited
to participate during the months of April, June,
July and August, and contact lists were revised
to update contact information, and include addi-
tional institutions expected to have postdocs.
For
our
grass-roots
survey
dissemination
approach we launched a website that could be
freely shared on social media and by email,
which explained the survey aims and contained a
centralized
contact
form.
The
contact
form
allowed
any
postdocs
who
had
not
been
reached via standard institutional contacts to
participate in the survey through this secondary
means of contact. In addition, we periodically
checked contact information for institutional rep-
resentatives, and updated the contact informa-
tion,
added
new
institutional
contacts,
and
encouraged
grass-roots
survey
dissemination
during the seven months that the survey was
active.
In all, 482 sets of putative postdoctoral over-
sight representatives were contacted by email,
although some larger institutions such as Har-
vard University and NIH often housed separate

 institutes or offices that were each contacted
separately – in these cases five and 30 sets,
respectively. During the seven months (February
2–September 2, 2016) that the survey was open,
over 7,600 postdoc responses were collected,
with respondents from every state, and from 351
institutions and universities. While the number of
respondents varied between months (ranging
from 24 during the two days the survey was
open in September to 2,268 in August), there
was no statistical difference in the gender ratio
of respondents over the seven months (whole
dataset: 53.1% female and 46.9% male ±5,
n = 7,579, c2 = 10.703, p = 0.1521; excluding

p = 0.1446). Respondents from the 46 institu-
tions that participated in the 2005 Sigma Xi sur-
vey, representing institutions with long-standing
institutional support for postdocs, contributed
3,126 responses, slightly less than half of all
respondents. This indicates that our addition of
a grass-roots approach to survey dissemination
contributed to a broader sampling of postdocs
across different institutional environments, pro-
viding an even more comprehensive assessment
of US postdoctoral experiences.
Four institution classifications were added as
fixed variables to the final dataset: institution
classification as public or private; Carnegie clas-
sification; US Census Region; and participation
in the 2005 Sigma Xi Postdoctoral Survey. City
and state of each institution were also added.
Statistical analysis
Raw response data were quality-filtered to select
for US-based institutions and individuals who
were currently in self-described postdoctoral
positions. Of the 7,673 total respondents, 70
were removed from the initial dataset using
these quality filters, yielding a final dataset of
7,603 US postdoctoral respondents. The demo-
graphics data shown (Figure 1) were calculated
by first sorting by gender, and then sorting by
the demographic of interest displayed as total
percentage of respondents per gender (all pan-
els except Figure 1H) or by a mean ± standard
deviation (Figure 1H) using Prism7 (GraphPad).
The effect of gender on salary, having a same
sex mentor, residency status, partner status, and
having children was tested using a Pearson c2
test (n = 7,516, 7,459, 7,543, 7,538, 7,532
respectively).
Sample
sizes
differed
because
respondents were allowed to skip questions,
and are therefore reported as ‘n’ here and
throughout.
However,
most
respondents
answered most survey questions, as can been
seen by the similar sample sizes for these differ-
ent survey questions. The effects of gender, age,
years since graduation, satisfaction with mentor,
and likelihood of being partnered on postdoc
salary were tested using a nominal logistic
regression model, n = 7,311. All survey ques-
tions reported here had categorical response
options, thus we used nominal logistic regres-
sion models instead of generalized linear regres-
sion models to account for the categorical
nature of the data. The effect of gender on
being in the fields of engineering or the physical
sciences was tested using a Pearson c2 test,
engineering n = 620, physical sciences n = 846.
We used a Bonferroni correction to account for
multiple testing, yielding a significance threshold
of p = 0.006. All statistical tests were two-sided.
Statistics were performed using JMP 13.1 by
SASS.
To determine what factors were significantly
correlated with postdoctoral career choice and
satisfaction with mentor, we ran a nominal logis-
tic regression model using 26 different fixed var-
iables listed in Supplementary file 1 (Table S7)
using the JMP 13.1 by SASS fit model platform.
We then determined which factors were signifi-
cant variables after controlling for multiple test-
ing. These estimates of effect size are reported
in Table 1 and Table 2. A total of 6,504
respondents answered all 26 of the questions
included in this analysis.
Cost of living and postdoc salaries
Cost of living index (COL) data for 2016 was pro-
duced by the Council for Community and Eco-
nomic Research (https://www.c2er.org/). State
COL data were generated by a weighted aver-
age across cities that have 2016 C2ER cost of liv-
ing data provided per state, for the cities where
postdoc salary data were available. Average
postdoc salary from all survey respondents for
each location was divided by matched local COL
values to produce postdoc salaries adjusted by
cost of living. Whenever income was not speci-
fied, the midpoint of income range selected by
the respondent was used. These values were
mapped to each state with red to blue corre-
sponding to lowest to highest adjusted salary,
respectively. In addition, counties with institu-
tions having at least 50 respondents were then
mapped separately, to map adjusted postdoc
salary in 48 counties with additional COL data,
against the background of the state COL data,
in 50 states plus Washington DC.

 Population proportion analysis
To
determine
the
number
of
individual
responses required from a total population of
100,000 for 95% and 99% confidence levels, at a
5% margin of error, assuming the true popula-
tion proportion being measured is between 3–
50% of the total population, we conducted a
population proportion analysis using the equa-
tion and definitions as described in Tintle et al.
(Tintle et al., 2016) and at Select Statistical
Services Limited (Select Statistical Services Lim-
ited,
2018).
Results
are
reported
in
Supplementary file 1 (Table S1).
Data analysis of survey respondent
proportions
Inconsistent definitions across institutions and
lack of existing institutional contact lists for post-
docs, particularly for those without postdoctoral
offices and other support, can make collecting
representative data for postdocs challenging
(Schaller et al., 2017). Thus demographics of
respondents may differ across surveys, and the
postdoctoral demographics of previous survey
datasets may differ from those observed in our
study. To further assess our demographic data,
we
conducted
the
comparisons
described
below.
We compared our demographics to that of
the 2005 Sigma Xi survey, which is perhaps the
most comparable effort to our own, having
7,600 postdoc respondents, both citizens and
noncitizens (Davis, 2005). The 2005 Sigma Xi
dataset had 42% female postdocs (51% female
for US citizens, and 35% female for internation-
als), and overall 46% US citizen and permanent
resident postdocs (54% temp visas). Our current
survey dataset contains a higher percentage of
both female postdocs (53% female) and US citi-
zen and permanent resident postdocs (55%) rel-
ative to the Sigma Xi survey from a decade ago,
which
may
in
part
reflect
changing
demo-
graphics of the US postdoctoral population, as
well difference in institutions sampled. However,
the relative difference in proportion of females
for US and non-US citizens remains consistent
(approximately 15%); our US citizen respondents
were
60%
female,
while
our
international
respondents were 46% female.
An alternative explanation for this increase in
female respondents in our dataset relative to the
earlier Sigma Xi survey is that women may have
disproportionately responded to our survey. We
tested this hypothesis by checking the University
of Chicago female and male response ratio
against the actual sex ratio of female and male
postdocs in the Biological Sciences. Our survey
respondents were 49.3% female and 50.7%
male, while the actual sex ratio of female and
male postdocs in the University of Chicago Bio-
logical Sciences was 46.5% female and 53.5%
male, which puts our survey respondent ratio
well within the standard 5% margin of error.
While it is unclear how representative University
of Chicago postdocs are of the national post-
doctoral population, it is important to remember
that the surveyed population, by definition, all
have advanced degrees, work at research institu-
tions, and are all highly likely to have strong
command of the English language, even if it is
not their first language. Doctorate recipients
make up 2% of the US national population
(United States Census Bureau, 2015). As doc-
torates are a small percentage of the national
population, they are likely to make up a small
percentage of respondents to general national
surveys. Thus response biases of surveys target-
ing this population may differ from those target-
ing the general population.
