WHAT ARE THE NEW FINDINGS 
 The epidemiological literature on sitting and incident diabetes is very scant 
and rarely acknowledges the confounding  role of adiposity  
 Occupational,   non-TV leisure time at home, and total non-TV sitting  were 
not associated with incident diabetes  risk over 13 years of follow-up 
 TV time and total sitting were associated with diabetes but once baseline body 
mass index was taken into account these associations were attenuated 
 
HOW MIGHT IT IMPACT ON CLINICAL PRACTICE IN THE NEAR FUTURE  
 Our finding provide little support for developing interventions that 
specifically target sitting to reduce diabetes risk. 
 The weak evidence for   associations we found may be partly due to the 
protective effect of relatively high amounts of daily walking and other 
moderate to vigorous physical activity in this cohort.  
 Strategies to increase walking and other physical activity and reduce BMI 
remain the cornerstone of diabetes prevention

ABSTRACT  
Background/Aim: Although certain types of sedentary behaviour have been linked to 
metabolic risk, prospective studies describing the links between sitting with incident diabetes 
are scarce and often do not account for baseline adiposity. We investigate the associations 
between context-specific sitting and incident diabetes in a cohort of mid-aged to older British 
civil servants.   Methods: Using data from the Whitehall II Study (n=4811), Cox proportional 
hazards models (adjusted for age, sex, ethnicity, employment grade, smoking, alcohol intake, 
fruit and vegetable consumption, self-rated health, physical functioning, walking and  
moderate-to-vigorous  physical activity, and BMI) were fitted to examine associations 
between  total sitting and context–specific sitting time (work, television (TV), non-TV leisure 
time sitting at home) at Phase 5 (1997-99) and fasting glucose-defined incident diabetes up to 
2011.    Results: Total sitting (HR of top compared to the bottom group: 1.26; 95%CI: 1.00 
to 1.62; p=0.01) and TV sitting (1.33; 1.03 to1.88;  p=0.05) showed  associations with 
incident diabetes; once BMI was included in the model these associations were attenuated for 
both  total sitting (1.19; 0.92 to 1.55; p=0.22) and TV sitting (1.31; 0.96 to 1.76;  p=0.14).   
Conclusions:  We found limited evidence linking sitting and incident diabetes over 13 years 
in this cohort of civil servants.

 INTRODUCTION 
Sedentary behaviour (SB)  comprises a set of waking time activities that are characterised by 
an energy expenditure of ≤1.5 MET in a sitting or reclining posture.1 Sitting is a ubiquitous 
behaviour in todays’ world and   has been linked to broad outcomes such as all-cause 
mortality2 3 4.   A growing body of research has examined the cardiometabolic consequences 
of sitting in both population3 4 and laboratory 5 settings.  Data on sitting and risk for incident 
diabetes are scarce. A meta-analysis of 10 cross-sectional and prospective epidemiological 
studies concluded that the population groups with the greatest levels of SB time had 112% 
higher risk for type 2 diabetes compared with the lowest SB time groups.6  All included 
studies  used television viewing (TV)  as a proxy of total SB7-10 and only one 7 adjusted for 
baseline adiposity. Adiposity is associated with both type 2 diabetes and SB time11-13  and as 
such it may be a confounder that needs to be accounted for.   A more recent meta-analysis on 
SB and cardiometabolic disease events and mortality3  also showed that across all  outcomes 
the most consistent associations  were seen for risk for type 2 diabetes (>90% increase in 
risk).  All  five included studies also had TV viewing as the exposure3.  But it is unclear 
whether these findings are driven by the sitting that TV viewing involves  per se. TV time is 
a poor indicator of total SB14 15 and sitting  time16 that is confounded by multiple aspects of 
socioeconomic circumstances,17  dietary factors, 6 3 and mental health18.   Such a breadth of 
confounding has not been fully accounted for by studies in the field.  Beyond TV time, a  
recent study of total sitting and incident diabetes in a sample of adults from Denmark found  
associations only among the physically inactive and the obese groups.19   Sitting can occur in 
many different contexts (e.g. work, leisure time, transportation) and there is a limited number 
of cohort studies 9 20 21  that examined context-specific associations with diabetes risk (all US-
based).    TV time only,9  9 20 TV and total leisure-time sitting,21  but not work related sitting9

20, were associated with diabetes;  on one occasion these associations were eliminated once 
baseline BMI was taken into account20.     
The aim of this study was to examine the associations between context-specific sitting with 
incident diabetes among mid-aged and older British civil servants over a 13-years period.  
We sought to highlight the role of adiposity by presenting these associations with and without 
adjustment for baseline BMI. 
 
METHODS 
Participants and study background 
The Whitehall II study was established in 1985 to examine the biological mechanisms that 
account for observed social inequalities in cardiovascular disease and diabetes.  22  The 
sample included in this study comprised 4811 individuals (3501 men and 1310 women) from 
clerical and office support grades, middle ranking executive grades and senior administrative 
grades. Baseline examination (Phase 1: 1985-88) involved a questionnaire and a clinical 
examination and subsequent measurement, phases have alternated between postal 
questionnaire alone and postal questionnaire accompanied by a clinical examination. Ethical 
approval was granted by the University College London Medical School Committee. 
Informed consent was obtained at baseline and renewed at each contact. The detailed 
measures of sitting and PA included in this report were undertaken during the 5th phase of 
data collection between 1997 and 1999 with follow-up for incident diabetes until December 
2011.

Measurement of sitting behaviours    
The questionnaire included items related to both occupational and leisure time sitting 
behaviours.22 Participants were asked ‘On average how many hours per week do you spend: 
sitting at work, driving or commuting?’ and ‘sitting at home e.g. watching TV, sewing, at a 
desk’, and responded by selecting one of eight time categories (none, 1 hour, 2-5, 6-10, 11-
20, 21-30, 31-40, >40 hours).  For sitting at home participants were given an open text 
response option to specify two types of sitting and then selected a time category for each. 
Using the midpoint of each time category (exactly 40hrs was used to represent the >40hrs 
category), 6 indicators of sitting expressed as hours per week were computed: 1) work related 
sitting time, 2) TV time, 3) Non-TV leisure sitting time at home, 4) Total leisure time sitting 
at home (sum of 2 and 3 above),  5) Total sitting time (sum of 1-3 above), and 6) non-TV 
total sitting time (the sum of 1 and 3 above). Five of these items (1-5) have been used 
previously9 11, 22   and although there is currently no objective criterion measure of context 
specific sitting, these questionnaire items have demonstrated concurrent validity with past 
weeks recall questionnaires (Pearsons r=0.44)  and activity diaries (r=0.41).23  
Outcome measure 
Outcomes included incident diabetes up to December 2011.    As previously described24, 
blood glucose was measured using the glucose oxidase method.   Incident cases of diabetes 
were identified by fasting blood glucose concentration (≥ 7.0mmol/L), according to the 2006 
World Health Organization (WHO) classification25.

Covariates 
Height (metres) and weight (kg) were measured at the clinical examinations. Body Mass 
Index (BMI) was computed by dividing squared height by bodyweight. Sociodemographic 
covariates  included age, gender, ethnicity (white vs. non-white),   employment grade (a 
comprehensive marker of socioeconomic circumstance related to salary, level of 
responsibility and social status),   smoking status (current, previous, or never a smoker), 
alcohol consumption (units per week), frequency of fruit and vegetable consumption,  self-
rated health (excellent, very good, good, fair, or poor), and physical functioning score 
(continuous) using the SF-36 scale26. PA was measured using a 20-items modified version of 
the previously validated Minnesota Leisure-Time Physical Activity Questionnaire that 
enquired about occupational, domestic and leisure time physical activities. These questions 
have been shown to have acceptable criterion validity against accelerometry27 and have 
demonstrated excellent predictive validity for mortality 28 in the Whitehall II study. Physical 
activities were classified by metabolic equivalents (MET)29 with moderate intensity activities 
ranging from 3-5.9 MET and vigorous intensity activities 6 MET or greater. As the energy 
cost of walking is dependent on walking pace and could not be determined from the Phase 5 
questionnaire, walking time did not contribute to the MVPA and was entered as a separate 
covariate.  
Statistical analyses 
Participants with prevalent diabetes at baseline (based on the 2006 WHO fasting glucose 
definition25) were excluded from analyses.  Due to low numbers in some of the eight original 
time categories for each sitting exposure, each sitting time variable was regrouped into three 
categories of near equal numbers as the data permitted (exact tertiles were not possible due to 
abnormal distribution): work sitting was grouped as 0 to <15,  ≥15 to <35,  and ≥35 
 British Journal of Sports Medicine. Accepted 6.01.2017 
8 
 
hours/week;  TV sitting as 0 to <11, ≥11  to  <16, and ≥16 hours/week; non-TV Leisure Time 
Sitting at home as 0 to <8, ≥8  to  <16, and ≥16 hours/week; leisure time sitting as 0 to <15,  
≥15 to <25,  and ≥25 hours/week; total sitting as 0 to <33,  ≥33 to <50,  and ≥50 hours/week; 
and total sitting excluding TV as 0 to <33, ≥33  to  <50, and ≥50 hours/week. Participants 
with missing data in any variables required for this analyses were excluded from analyses.  
Cox proportional hazards models for each exposure were fitted to examine the associations 
between each of the six sitting exposures and incident diabetes up to 2011. Hazard ratios and 
95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated for each category of sitting time, by type, with 
the lowest group as the reference category. Examination of Schoenfeld residuals and Nelson-
Aelen cumulative hazards plots provided no evidence for deviations from proportionality in 
any of the Cox models. Analyses were limited to those who had completed both the survey 
and clinical examination, who were still working in the civil service or elsewhere, and who 
had no prevalent diabetes (590 cases excluded) or heart diseases (1145 cases excluded) at 
baseline. Models were first adjusted for age, gender, ethnicity, and employment grade   
(Model 1) and then further adjusted for smoking status, weekly alcohol intake, fruit and 
vegetable consumption, self-rated health, and physical functioning  (Model 2). The final 
model was also adjusted for PA (Model 3). To test for linear trends in individual parameters 
the Wald chi-squared test was used and the Likelihood-ratio chi-squared test was used for 
non-linear relationships. As previously,30 we examined the independence of the observed 
associations (only for the sitting exposures that were associated with incident diabetes in any 
of  the three models) from adiposity in a separate analysis where in addition to all covariates 
specified in Model 3 we also adjusted  for  baseline BMI.    
In a sensitivity analyses  we  repeated the above Cox analyses examining the associations 
between sitting behaviours in Phase 5 and incident diabetes using  a  75 g oral glucose 
tolerance test (OGTT)  at Phase 9 (which was the last Phase such a test was included).  
 British Journal of Sports Medicine. Accepted 6.01.2017

OGTT involved determination of 2-hour postload glucose according to the WHO standards 25 
(2-hour post-load glucose ≥ 11.1 mmol/L). Analyses were conducted in 2016 using STATA 
version 13.2 (StataCorp, College Station, TX).  
 
RESULTS 
Sample characteristics 
Out of the 10,308 participants at Whitehall II onset, 7870 took part in Phase 5. Among them, 
517,   1145, and 1397 were excluded due to existing diabetes, existing CVD, and missing 
data in at least one of the variables needed for the multivariate analyses (Supplemental Table 
1), respectively.   The characteristics of the Phase 5 participants that were included in this 
analysis are shown in Table 1.    As previously reported,22 compared with those in the sample 
of the present study, those lost to follow-up between the study’s inception in 1985 and Phase 
5 were slightly older at date of screening, consumed slightly less alcohol, and were more 
likely to be male, obese and in a higher employment grade in 1985.   The mean follow up was 
13.0 years corresponding to 62,463 person-years. 
 Incident diabetes  
In total, 402 cases of fasting glucose defined incident diabetes occurred during the follow-up 
period.  As Table 2 shows, leisure time sitting, total sitting, and TV time showed associations 
with incident diabetes in the models with minimal adjustment (Model 1) and these 
associations persisted for TV time and total sitting once the remaining potential confounders 
were taken into account.  Work-time sitting, non-TV leisure time sitting, and total sitting 
excluding TV time were not associated with the outcome in any of the three models (Table 
2).  Baseline BMI was associated with incident diabetes (per unit HR: 1.15;  95%CI: 1.12  to 
 British Journal of Sports Medicine. Accepted 6.01.2017 
10 
 
1.18,  p<0.001) after adjusting for  total sitting time, age, sex, employment grade, ethnicity, 
smoking status, alcohol consumption, PA, general health, physical functioning and frequency 
of fruit & vegetable consumption. 
 
Independence of the observed associations from baseline BMI 
Table 3 presents the results additionally adjusted for BMI for those exposures that showed 
associations with incident diabetes in any of the three models. Once BMI was included in the 
model (Model 4), all associations were attenuated. For example, for TV time the HR of the 
top compared to the lowest group was attenuated to 1.31 (95% CI: 0.96 to 1.76).    
Supplemental Table 2 presents the characteristics of the sample included in the sensitivity 
analysis with OGTT-defined incident diabetes between Phase 5 (1996-8) and Phase 9 (2006-
08)  (n=4735, 9.7 average years of follow up, 439 events, 45,864  person-years).  Sensitivity 
analyses results were consistent with the main analyses described above and only TV sitting 
time and total sitting were associated with OGTT-defined incident diabetes (Supplemental 
Table 3). Once baseline BMI was taken into account these associations were also attenuated, 
although TV time maintained a borderline association (Supplemental Table 4).  
 
DISCUSSION   
Main findings and comparison with previous literature 
 Our study addresses several gaps in the SB literature by considering type-specific sitting in 
relation to incident diabetes over a long follow up. We found that total sitting and TV time 
were both associated with incident diabetes independently of PA and these associations were

attenuated once baseline BMI was taken into account. Our findings are a novel contribution, 
with previous prospective research being reliant on TV time as the sole marker of sitting and 
in most cases lacking adjustment for baseline adiposity.8 9 10   
A long-term prospective study, broadly comparable to ours, featured a sample of 4554 
American women with gestational diabetes and examined the association between different 
types of sitting (TV, other domestic, non-domestic/work, car driving) and risk of type 2 
diabetes over 16 years20.  The results of this study were concordant with ours as the TV time 
relative risk prior to adjustment for BMI was 1.41 (1.11-1.79) for the 11-20 hours/week of 
TV time group 20 (vs.  1.39, 1.03-1.88 for ≥ 16 hours/week in our study)   and adjustments for 
baseline BMI attenuated substantially these associations.20 In a multi-ethnic US cohort total 
leisure time sitting (62% of which was TV time) was associated with incident diabetes over 
11 years of follow up21 in overweight and obese participants but not in participants with a 
BMI<25.  A large Danish study of 72,608 adults with a relatively short follow up (<5 years)  
found that once BMI and physical activity were taken into account total sitting time was   
associated with  HbA1c –defined incident diabetes only among the physically inactive and 
the obese groups19.   Adjustment for baseline BMI attenuated the  associations between 
weekly TV viewing frequency  and clustered cardiometabolic risk  in another prospective 
British study over a 21 year follow up.30   
 
The role of BMI 
Conceptually, adiposity and sitting may be associated in a bi-directional manner but not both 
directions of the association are empirically supported.  Albeit limited in volume, existing 
literature 12 13 (including a Whitehall II cohort study 13) suggests that previous adiposity 
determines future SB and no prospective study, to our knowledge, has indicated that sitting 
 British Journal of Sports Medicine. Accepted 6.01.2017 
12 
 
predicts markers of adiposity or obesity. Although some shared variance is likely to exist, it is 
more likely that BMI is a confounder rather than a mediator of the association between sitting 
and diabetes, an assertion that is indirectly supported by a recent laboratory study showing 
that  the energy expenditure  benefits of simply reducing sitting are negligible.31  While more 
work is needed in this area,   our results and the above literature suggest that studies that 
examine the links between SB and diabetes without adjusting for adiposity may be 
compromised.   Additional pathways   linking SB, adiposity, and diabetes include the 
established relationships between TV viewing and obesogenic diets .32   SB may displace PA 
time leading to an decrease in energy expenditure and unfavourable weight changes.33   It is 
worth noting that the top TV tertile in Whitehall II corresponded to >2.3 hours/day,  which  is 
well below the   general population in  England aged >55  where mean values are 3-4 
hours/day34).  Despite this relatively low bound of the high TV group, only 0.007% (7/937)  
of  its members reported  less than 3.6 hour of  TV per day  and as such it is unlikely that our 
analyses under-estimated the associations due to a likely threshold effect.  
 
Interpretation of main findings 
During prolonged sitting, differences in energy balance have been proposed as a major 
determinant of the metabolic dysfunction (as indexed by compromised insulin action) 
observed among non-obese young and fit men and women.35   Acknowledging the generally 
accepted theorem that increased adiposity (which BMI is thought to reflect reasonably at the 
population level) is the result of chronic energy imbalance, these findings suggest that future 
studies examining the links between SB and diabetes will benefit from incorporating more 
robust assessments of energy intake and expenditure.

One possible explanation for the limited evidence linking sitting and diabetes risk in the 
current study is the protective effect of the high volumes of total reported MVPA and in 
particular daily walking that is reported in the Whitehall cohort.  For example,  the mean 
reported daily walking time (42.73 ± 22.70 minutes/day) is over double the reported UK 
national average.36   Several recent  large prospective studies have showed that the 
associations between sitting time and incident diabetes19 or cardiovascular disease37 38 are 
only observed in the least active participants.   
 In general,  previous literature is consistent in that TV time is prospectively associated with 
diabetes and other cardio metabolic outcomes3 39 but occupational sitting is not.40 This 
contradiction suggests that examining total sitting volumes alone may not be sufficiently 
informative due to the existence of context-specific unmeasured confounding (e.g. dietary or 
socioeconomic).  Another important consideration is the pattern of sitting (e.g. length of 
bouts and frequency of interruptions from sitting) that may be relevant to health outcomes but 
cannot be captured by self-report measures, including the questionnaires used in our study.  A 
study of 164 London office workers41 who wore inclinometers for 7 days found that 69% of 
sitting bouts are <10 minutes  with only <10% of all  bouts lasting   >60 minutes in duration. 
Both during work and in the evenings participants registered  approximately two sit-to stand 
transitions per hour, a pattern that has been linked to measurable improvements in acute 
glycemic responses in  laboratory studies testing  interruptions of sitting with walking 5 42. 
Assuming the sitting patterns of the Whitehall II cohort are similar, the absence of notable 
effects may be partly attributed to the relatively frequent short physical activity bouts that 
confer glycemic protection in this occupational cohort.    
 
Strengths and limitations  
 British Journal of Sports Medicine. Accepted 6.01.2017

Strengths of our study include the prospective design, the long follow up, and the six sitting 
exposures (covering work, recreation, and commuting) that allowed us to take into account 
the sitting context. We were also able to take account of a broad range of important 
confounding factors, including physical functioning that is linked to acute injury and long-
standing illness and may be a contributor to increased sitting.   Our study also has limitations.  
Sitting was measured using self-report that may be subject to recall and social desirability 
biases. Leisure-time questions only captured sitting at home. Occupational cohorts are by 
definition sufficiently healthy at baseline to be in active employment which may reduce the 
extent to which our conclusions are generalizable. However, aetiological findings from 
Whitehall II are broadly consistent with those obtained from representative cohorts.43 Despite 
threats to the ecological validity of our study, it is reassuring that our results are in agreement 
with a clinical US cohort.20  We were able to take into account fruit and vegetable 
consumption that is an important for diabetes risk44  aspect of diet.   
Conclusions  
In conclusion, our study makes a unique contribution in the literature by examining 
prospectively a broad range of type-specific sedentary behaviours in relation to incident 
diabetes over a long follow up period of 13 years in a physically active cohort of British civil 
servants. We found moderate evidence linking TV time and limited evidence linking total 
sitting with diabetes but these links were dependent on baseline BMI.   It is important that 
prospective general population studies using objective measures of sitting patterns (in 
addition to sitting context-specific measures) and controlled trials replicate our findings.
