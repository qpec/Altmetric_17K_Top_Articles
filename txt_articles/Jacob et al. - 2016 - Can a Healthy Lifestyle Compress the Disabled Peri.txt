 Participants—Men and women ages 65 and older (N= 5248, mean age 72.7 ± 5.5 years, 57% 
women, 15.2% minority) who were living in the community, not wheel-chair dependent and able 
to give informed consent at baseline.
Measurements—Multiple lifestyle factors including smoking, alcohol consumption, physical 
activity, diet, body mass index (BMI), social networks and social support were measured at 
baseline. Activities of Daily Living (ADL) were assessed at baseline and throughout follow-up. 
Years of Life (YoL) was defined as years until death. Years of Able Life (YAL) was defined as 
years without any ADL difficulty. YAL/YoL%, the proportion of life lived able, was used to 
indicate the relative compression/expansion of the disabled period.
Results—The average duration of disabled years was 4.5 (out of 15.4 mean YoL) for women and 
2.9 (out of 12.4 mean YoL) for men. In a multivariable model, obesity (compared to normal BMI) 
was associated with 7.3% (95% CI, 5.4–9.2) lower YAL/YoL%. Scores in the lowest quintile of 
the Alternate Healthy Eating Index (compared to highest) were associated with a 3.7% (95% CI, 
1.6–5.9) lower YAL/YoL%. Every 25 blocks walked in a week was associated with 0.5% (95% CI, 
0.3–0.8) higher YAL/YoL%.
Conclusion—The effects of healthy lifestyle factors on the proportion of future life lived free of 
disability indicate that the disabled period can be compressed, given the right combination of these 
factors.

INTRODUCTION
The duration of the disabled period near the end of life has enormous personal and societal 
implications.1 A disabled older adult experiences a poorer quality of life2 and has poorer 
health outcomes including frequent hospital admissions3 and a higher risk for mortality.4,5 
Years lived with disability contribute substantially to Medicare costs6 which are already 
projected to increase due to the aging of the baby-boom generation. Informal caregiving for 
disabled older adults, primarily by family members, result in considerable invisible cost.7 
Despite these implications, and the obvious public health need to compress this terminal 
morbid period, we have limited evidence regarding the factors that influence the length and 
proportion of the disabled period near the end of life.
The average length of the disabled period in populations and its change over time in the 
context of increasing life expectancy has been the subject of much debate.8 Central to this 
debate is the compression of morbidity paradigm which argues that healthy lifestyle factors 
can postpone the onset of disease and disability, compressing the morbid period.9 
Postponement of disease and disability by a healthy lifestyle is well known, however, 
healthy lifestyle factors can also postpone death. Therefore, compression of morbidity can 
occur only if factors postpone morbidity to a greater degree than death.10 It is therefore 
important to distinguish and delineate the effects of lifestyle factors on the onset of disease 
and disability from their effect on the life span in order to understand their potential to 
compress morbidity.

 The Cardiovascular Health Study, a cohort of older adults followed for over 25 years, 
provides a unique opportunity in aging research to assess health and morbidity near the end 
of the life span. In this study, we used disability as our measure of morbidity and examined 
the differential effect of multiple lifestyle factors measured late in life on the health span and 
life span of CHS participants. Health span was measured as the duration of life free of 
disability as observed in the study, defined as years of life without any reported difficulty in 
activities of daily living and referred to as Years of Able Life (YAL). Life span was 
measured as the total Years of Life (YoL) in the study. Additionally, we describe the 
association of lifestyle factors with the YAL/YoL%, an estimate of the proportion of 
observed years without disability, in order to determine whether any of these factors are 
associated with a relative compression or expansion of the disabled period prior to death.
METHODS
Study design and participants
The Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS) is a longitudinal study of cardiovascular risk factors 
in 5888 adults aged 65 and older at baseline. Participants were recruited from a random 
sample of age-eligible Medicare beneficiaries and household members in four US 
communities: Sacramento County, California; Forsyth County, North Carolina; Washington 
County, Maryland and Allegheny County, Pennsylvania.11,12 Eligible participants were not 
institutionalized or wheelchair dependent, did not require a proxy for consent, were not 
under treatment for cancer at the time of enrollment and were expected to remain in their 
location for at least three years. The study enrolled 5201 participants in 1990 and added 687 
African-Americans in 1993. Participants provided written informed consent and the protocol 
was approved by the institutional review boards at each participating center.
Participants completed an extensive interview and examination at the field centers at 
baseline. After enrollment, participants were seen annually, and were contacted by telephone 
at 6-month intervals until 1999. Since 1999, participants have been contacted every 6 
months by telephone to ascertain health status including disability, and were invited to 
participate in an in-person visit in 2005–06.
Years of Life (YoL), Years of Able Life (YAL) and the Proportion of Life Lived Able (YAL/YoL 
%)
Study participants were followed for a total of 25 years. Deaths were identified at 6 month 
contacts and from obituaries, medical records, proxy interviews, death certificates and a 
search of the National Death Index. Follow-up for vital status was 100% complete. YoL was 
defined as each person’s number of years from baseline to death. We estimated remaining 
YoL for 544 (9.2%) CHS participants who were still alive at the end of follow-up using 
regression equations based on age, sex, baseline ADL and self-rated health, as described 
elsewhere.13
Self-reported difficulties in Activities of Daily Living (ADL; eating, bathing, toileting, 
dressing, getting out of bed or chair, and walking around the home) were assessed annually 
through 1999 and every six months thereafter. YAL was defined as the number of observed

 years without any ADL difficulty. From 2000 to 2004, the questions regarding ADLs 
addressed change in difficulty rather than difficulty status. To create a complete data set of 
ADL difficulty every 6 months, we imputed ADL difficulty status at the half year intervals 
between 1990 and 1999, and at all of the time points from 2000 to 2004. For all other time 
points, 0.3% to 12.5% of ADL data were missing and were also imputed. This method of 
imputation of CHS data has been previously described.14,15 Remaining YAL for 544 
participants who survived to the end of follow-up were imputed using regression 
equations.13 Subsequently, YAL/YoL% was calculated to represent the relative proportion of 
the observed life span which was lived free of ADL difficulty.
Lifestyle factors
Lifestyle factors were assessed at baseline. Smoking and alcohol consumption were self-
reported. Participants were considered to be former alcohol drinkers if they were non-
drinkers at baseline and reported 1) having stopped alcohol consumption in the past five 
years and/or 2) ever drank five or more drinks of any kind of alcohol almost every day. 
Leisure time activity (kilocalories/week) was assessed using the modified Minnesota leisure-
time activities questionnaire,16 and a weighted sum of kilocalories expended in physical 
activity was calculated and log transformed. The highest intensity of reported activity was 
used to categorize the exercise intensity of participants to high, moderate, low or none.17 
Distances walked were assessed by self-report of blocks walked in the previous week. 
Dietary habits were assessed for the original cohort alone using the picture-sort National 
Cancer Institute food frequency questionnaire.18 The Alternate Healthy Eating Index 
(AHEI) was calculated from these data consistent with previous studies19 and categorized 
into quintiles. Standardized techniques were used to measure height and weight. Body Mass 
Index (BMI) was calculated as weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in 
meters. Social support was measured using a six-item version of the Interpersonal Support 
Evaluation List,20 and social networks (size, closeness and frequency of contacts) were 
measured using the 10-item Lubben social network scale.21
Potential confounders
Potential confounders considered included socio-demographic factors (age, sex, race, 
education, income and marital status) and baseline health indicators (self-reported health, 
change in weight, difficulties in instrumental activities of daily living, chronic health 
conditions, and cognition). These were selected based on their established association with 
lifestyle, onset of disability and life expectancy. Sex, age, race, education, income, marital 
status, self-rated health, weight change of more than 10 pounds in the previous year, arthritis 
and cancer were self-reported at baseline. Difficulties in Instrumental Activities of Daily 
Living (IADL) were self-reported in six domains (telephone use, shopping, preparing food, 
performing light household work, performing heavy household work, and managing 
finances). Cognition was measured using the Mini Mental Status Examination.22 Retaining 
methods used previously in CHS, we defined hypertension as self-report of high blood 
pressure accompanied by medication use or an average seated blood pressure of ≥160/95.23 
Borderline hypertension was defined as a systolic blood pressure from 140 to 159 or a 
diastolic from 90 to 94. Diabetes was classified as fasting blood glucose ≥126 mg/dL or use 
of anti-glycemic medication, and impaired fasting glucose was classified as glucose 110 to

 125 mg/dL.24 Angina, myocardial infarction, heart failure, peripheral artery disease, stroke, 
and transient ischemic attack were identified using self-report and hospitalization records 
and adjudicated as previously described.25 Depression was assessed using the 10-item 
version of the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale.26 Missing values for 
lifestyle factors and potential confounders were imputed as described previously.27 Data 
were available for 5248 participants after imputation.
Statistical analysis
Mean YoL, YAL and YAL/YoL% were computed by categories of each baseline lifestyle 
factor or confounder. Means and 95% confidence intervals of YoL, YAL, disabled years and 
YAL/YoL% were computed for each age and sex group. We used a confounder-adjusted 
multi-variable linear regression model to examine the effect of lifestyle factors on YAL, YoL 
and the YAL/YoL%. As diet was assessed only in the original cohort, sample size for this 
model was 4581. Results from this model were compared to that from a model excluding the 
diet variable (n=5248) and as the results were similar, the model with the diet variable is 
presented. Because of the large number of comparisons, we report p-values of <0.001 as 
statistically significant.
Additionally, to illustrate the potential for optimizing YAL, YoL and YAL/YoL%, we 
compared the difference between an optimal (healthy) lifestyle versus an unhealthy lifestyle 
using predicted values from statistical models. We calculated the predicted mean values of 
YAL, YoL and YAL/YoL% in gender and race-specific models that pre-specified values for 
all other socio-demographic variables and lifestyle variables excluding diet (n=5248). Socio-
demographic variables were fixed at typical values (70 years of age, high school/GED 
education, currently married, and income <$25,000). The healthy lifestyle was defined by 
the following characteristics: never smoking, 1–7 drinks/week, BMI 18–25, high exercise 
intensity, 2300 Kcal exercise (~75th percentile), 48 blocks walked (~75th percentile), social 
network score of 38 (~75th percentile), and social support score 6 (~25th percentile). The 
unhealthy lifestyle was defined by the following: current smoking, ≥14 drinks/week, 
BMI≥30, no exercise intensity, 375 Kcal exercise (~25th percentile), 6 blocks walked (~ 
25th percentile), social network score 28 (~25th percentile), and social support score 9 
(~75th percentile). This comparison would help to illustrate the values of YAL, YoL and 
YAL/YOL% that could potentially be achieved by having all the specified healthy lifestyle 
factors, as compared to values achieved when all the specified multiple unhealthy factors 
exist, among individuals in different race and gender groups.
RESULTS
Baseline characteristics
At baseline, the mean (SD) participant age was 72.7 (5.5) years, 57% were women and 
15.2% were black. At the end of follow-up, 90.8 % of the participants had died. Distribution 
of baseline characteristics and the unadjusted mean YAL, YoL and YAL/YoL% by these 
characteristics are shown in Table 1. For example, there were 2992 women who averaged 
15.4 YoL, 10.9 YAL, and who spent 65.6 % of their YoL in the able state. Men in the study 
(n= 2256) averaged 12.4 YoL, 9.5 YAL and were able for 70.9% of their YoL. The average

 number of disabled years was 2.9 years for men and 4.5 years for women. After adjustment 
for all of the demographic variables in Table 1, each lifestyle measure was significantly 
associated with each of the outcomes at p<.001 except smoking and YAL/YoL% (p=.007) 
and social support and YoL (p=.006).
Trends in disabled years
The number of observed years of total and able life was lower for older participants, 
reflecting their earlier death during the course of the study and consequently, shorter follow-
up period (Table 2). However, the number of disabled years was similar across baseline age 
groups among men as well as among women, indicating the terminal nature of the disabled 
period. Consequently, the YAL/YoL% was lower among older age groups among both men 
and women. Women in all age groups had more disabled years than men in corresponding 
age groups.
Lifestyle factors and YAL, YoL, YAL/YoL%
After adjusting for socio-demographic and baseline health variables, as well as other 
lifestyle factors, smoking was associated with fewer years of life (3.5 years less), and fewer 
years of able life (3.1 years less) (Table 3). Former smokers had fewer YoL (1.3 years less) 
and fewer YAL (1.2 years less) when compared to non-smokers. However, the YAL/YoL 
percentages among smokers as well as former smokers were not significantly different from 
that of non-smokers. Former drinkers had fewer YoL when compared to non-drinkers, but 
there was no significant difference in the YAL or YAL/YoL%. Current drinkers, on the other 
hand, did not seem to be significantly different from non-drinkers in terms of YAL, YoL and 
YAL/YoL%. Higher energy expenditure (2.7 fold) in Kilocalories was associated with more 
YAL (borderline significance), albeit with a small effect size (0.3 years). Exercise intensity 
was no longer significantly associated with YAL, YoL or YAL/YoL% but those who walked 
more blocks per week had significantly greater YAL/YoL%. Every 25 blocks walked per 
week was associated with 0.5% higher YAL/YoL%. Compared to the highest quintile of the 
AHEI, which is indicative of a healthy diet, lower quintiles were associated with 
significantly fewer YoL and YAL. Participants in the worst quintile of AHEI had 1.5 years 
fewer YoL, 1.5 years fewer YAL and 3.7% lower YAL/YoL%. Using the conservative p-
value cut-off of <0.001, the latter difference would be of borderline statistical significance. 
Underweight participants (BMI < 18.5) had significantly fewer YoL (3 years less) compared 
to those with normal BMI, but their YAL and YAL/YoL% were not significantly different. 
Participants who were obese (BMI ≥ 30) had a significantly lower proportion of able years 
(7.3% less) when compared to those with normal BMI, but the higher YoL and lower YAL 
associated with this category did not reach statistical significance. Social networks and 
social support were not found to be associated with YoL, YAL or YAL/YoL%.
Figure 1 displays the predicted mean values of YAL, YoL and YAL/YoL% from statistical 
models that pre-specified values of a healthy and unhealthy lifestyle. At comparable values 
of socio-demographic factors, a healthy lifestyle differed considerably from an unhealthy 
lifestyle in terms of YAL, YoL, disabled years and YAL/YoL% and was associated with an 
absolute and relative compression of the disabled period in all race and gender groups.

 DISCUSSION
In this community-based cohort of 5248 older adults who were recruited at an average age 
of 73 years and followed up for 25 years, the average number of disabled years was about 
2.9 years for men and 4.5 years for women. Multiple lifestyle factors were significantly 
associated with the observed total and able years of life as well as the proportion of observed 
life lived without disability. Greater distances walked and better diet quality were associated 
with a relative compression of the disabled period. Obesity was associated with a relative 
expansion of the disabled period. Smoking was associated with a loss of both able and total 
years.
More than three decades ago, several contradicting theories of population aging were 
proposed to explain how increasing life expectancy might influence the duration of the 
morbid period.9,28,29 While most of the research evaluating the theories have examined 
population trends in active life expectancy over time30–32, there has been limited information 
on factors that influence the duration of this period at the individual level. Our results 
provide epidemiological evidence for the plausibility of the compression of morbidity theory 
by demonstrating the potential for lifestyle factors to compress or expand the disabled period 
near the end of life. As demonstrated in Figure 1, the presence of varying combinations of 
these factors in older individuals could determine the absolute and relative duration of 
disability in individuals. Populations could compress or expand morbidity depending on the 
prevalence of risk factors and favorable factors. These results therefore have both clinical 
and broader public health implications.
Quantifying the morbid period has been difficult, given the dearth of observed data; 
demographic research on active life expectancies has provided the best estimates until now. 
Twenty two years ago, Guralnik et al. estimated mean disabled life expectancies of 1.5 years 
(White men), 1.6 years (Black men), 2.8 years (White women), and 3.0 years (Black 
women) at age 75 using life table methods.33 We used observed data rather than life tables 
and found the disabled period to be longer, but differences in methodology between the 
studies make it difficult to draw conclusions about a change over 22 years. Precise 
measurements of the terminal morbid period would be possible if cohorts of older adults are 
followed till extinction. Estimates of life expectancy are more readily available and indicate 
that observed values from CHS are generalizable to the US population. Survival rates in 
CHS have been compared to rates from US census data and found to be similar.34 The YoL 
values in CHS have been compared to life expectancy from the US life tables and found to 
have good agreement.13
The impact of lifestyle on health and life span is well known; what does our research 
contribute? We have provided evidence for the effect of a late life lifestyle on the actual 
duration and proportion of the terminal disabled period. This is a critical addition to the 
existing evidence on the effects of lifestyle on onset of disease, disability and mortality. For 
example, smoking is a well-known hazard for early death,35,36 however, the effect of 
smoking on disabled years in old age has not been clearly elucidated. Smoking has been 
shown to reduce active life expectancy in older adult populations,37,38 but these were 
estimates based on life tables and did not take multiple confounding factors into account.

 Our study provides evidence that even among smokers who avoided an early death, smoking 
continues to have a large impact on longevity and the length of the able period. Current 
alcohol consumption was not related to YoL or YAL though former drinkers had the poorest 
outcomes, which is consistent with previous reports that older adults stop drinking when 
they become ill.39,40
A high level of physical activity among older adults is associated with a reduced duration of 
disability before death37 and is a strong predictor for dying without disability.41 Our findings 
are consistent with the literature and provide evidence of the association of physical activity 
with disabled years. A healthy diet, as defined by the AHEI, is associated with a lower risk 
for chronic disease19 and mortality.42 Our findings indicate that a healthy diet among older 
adults can potentially contribute to reducing the disabled period.
The effect of obesity on mortality declines with age43,44 and it does not seem to be as poor a 
prognostic factor among the old as in the young. Nevertheless, obese older adults have been 
shown to have greater disability rates45 and a shorter active life expectancy.46 Our finding 
that obesity is associated with an expansion of the disabled period has important 
ramifications in the context of rising obesity rates among the older adult population.47 
Underweight older adults, known to be at high risk for poorer health outcomes48, had the 
highest risk for reduced total and able life span, among all BMI categories in our study.
The main strength of our study is the 25 year follow-up of a large, well characterized, 
community-based sample of older adults with a mean age of 73 at cohort entry, which 
provided observed data on disability late in life. The non-availability of such data has been a 
deterrent to drawing conclusions about this period. ‘Years of Able Life’ incorporates health 
and survival, and is a robust measure of successful aging. It has an edge over ‘time to death’
—the outcome measure in most survival analyses—by accounting for the quality of survival, 
and it remains a powerful and efficient primary outcome measure.49 In other studies, Active 
Life Expectancy has been defined using the endpoint “loss of independence in ADL”, and 
therefore may incorporate a period where older adults experience difficulties in these 
activities but do not obtain assistance. As defined here, YAL represents a fully able period 
where participants experience no difficulty in ADL and is hence a more accurate measure of 
the duration of good physical function.
Several limitations should be kept in mind while examining these results. Disability and 
health behaviors were self-reported and the subjectivity of self-report must be kept in mind, 
although self-report remains the gold standard of disability assessment. Health behaviors 
were assessed at baseline and behavior patterns could have changed over time influencing 
the outcome. However, we were able to characterize participants at a time when lifestyle had 
not been extensively altered by disease and the baseline assessment is therefore more likely 
to represent the lifestyle over a greater part of the adult lifespan. Also, as measurement of 
the outcomes began at baseline, updating the lifestyle measures would have resulted in 
issues of reverse causality. It is also possible that earlier (e.g., mid-life) lifestyle, correlated 
with the baseline lifestyle measured in the study, may be driving the findings in this report. 
We also recognize that residual confounding may be present despite the multiple 
confounders that have been adjusted for.

 Conclusions
Among older adults, the mean duration of the disabled period is about 2.9 years for men and 
4.5 years for women. Lifestyle factors may potentially compress or expand this period, 
independent of their effect on life expectancy. While the increasing obesity levels in this age 
group can herald a ‘disability epidemic’, the promotion of healthy lifestyle factors can 
potentially reduce the public health burden due to disability as more adults reach old age.

aNon-Black minorities were included with Whites as they were very few (American Indian/Alaskan Native N=12, Asian/Pacific Islander N=4, 
Other = 4).
bThe overweight category (BMI 25.0 to 29.9) was subdivided into two groups as this category held a large proportion of the participants (41.3%)

aAll lifestyle factors were included in a single regression model, and were adjusted for sex, age, race, education, income and marital status, self-reported health, difficulties in Instrumental Activities of 
Daily Living, weight change, cognition and chronic conditions (arthritis, cancer, hypertension, diabetes, angina, myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, peripheral arterial disease, stroke, transient 
ischemic attack, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and depression).
bThe sample size is smaller as the diet variable was not available for the entire sample. Results from a model with the larger sample size (n=5248) but excluding the diet variable were similar.
cTo minimize false positive results due to multiple testing, the p-value cut-off of <0.001 was used.
dThis variable was natural log transformed and the coefficients should be interpreted as the increase in YoL, YAL and YAL/YoL% associated with a 2.72 fold increase in energy expenditure measured in 
kilocalories/week.
eA higher social support score indicates lower social support.
