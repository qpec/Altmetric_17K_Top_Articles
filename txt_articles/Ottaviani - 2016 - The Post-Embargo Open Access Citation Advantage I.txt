Abstract
Many studies show that open access (OA) articles—articles from scholarly journals made
freely available to readers without requiring subscription fees—are downloaded, and presum-
ably read, more often than closed access/subscription-only articles. Assertions that OA arti-
cles are also cited more often generate more controversy. Confounding factors (authors may
self-select only the best articles to make OA; absence of an appropriate control group of non-
OA articles with which to compare citation figures; conflation of pre-publication vs. published/
publisher versions of articles, etc.) make demonstrating a real citation difference difficult. This
study addresses those factors and shows that an open access citation advantage as high as
19% exists, even when articles are embargoed during some or all of their prime citation years.
Not surprisingly, better (defined as above median) articles gain more when made OA.
Introduction
All things being equal, that an article made freely available ought to get downloaded more than
a comparable article that costs money to access seems obvious. We mistrust the intuitively
obvious, though, largely because all things are rarely equal and confounding factors are not
always easy to intuit. Besides, more downloads (and presumably more readers) may not be suf-
ficient motivation for authors to make their articles open access (OA); researchers want their
work to have a measurable impact on their peers. They want to advance their field, boost their
careers by increasing their likelihood of receiving grants, and improve their chances for promo-
tion. . .preferably all three.
Citations are the coin of the impact realm, so a citation, not merely a download or reader-
ship, advantage is important to authors. A number of studies show that some kind of open
access citation advantage (OACA) exists. For example, an oft-cited paper by Hajjem, Harnad
and Gingras [1] found a 36–172% advantage, and the majority of studies (46/74) listed in [2]
also report an OACA. Many of these same studies have also been challenged, though:
• One frequently expressed concern is that authors self-select only articles of higher than aver-
age quality to make OA, which would be expected to get more citations regardless of whether
they were open ([3–7], e.g.).

Competing Interests: The author has declared that
no competing interests exist.
 • OA articles may have been previously available in working paper or pre-print versions that
differ from their final published form. The resulting final publications may benefit from that
early availability ([8–10], e.g.). Further, comparing the author’s accepted manuscript for one
article to the publisher’s formatted and copy-edited version for another introduces a con-
founding variable in terms of quality, or at least perceived quality. A like-with-like compari-
son to determine whether an OACA truly exists is challenging in such scenarios.
• It can be difficult to find articles of any kind that have been open for long enough, after being
previously closed, to show a meaningful effect on citation frequency [11].
• Finally, even if the above concerns are addressed, finding enough articles in a broad enough
range of disciplines to draw a conclusion on an OACA has proved challenging. Studies in
specific disciplines or single journals abound: 2/3 of the articles in [2] investigate citations
and OA in only a single discipline, and over half of those studies use a small sample size or
did not open articles for long. But even when convincing, such studies are prone to being dis-
missed as special cases, peculiar to the particular discipline or even sub-discipline.
One way to address these concerns would be to find an appropriate control group for a large
sampling of OA articles. This too is difficult; every article is (or at least should be!) unique, and
even so-called hybrid journals, which make some but not all articles OA, do not offer a straight-
forward means for comparison because of the self-selection problem, since they require authors
to pay an additional publication fee to make them open from the outset.
Methodology
In Deep Blue <deepblue.lib.umich.edu/documents>, the University of Michigan’s institutional
repository service, we have the equivalent of a random sample of thousands of OA articles
from thousands of journals. Each article has the following characteristics: Prior to a known
date (ranging from 2006 onward) these articles, since they are the final published version, were
only available by subscription. After that date, they became freely available via Deep Blue.
Meanwhile, other articles from the same journal issue as the now-OA article continued to only
be available to subscribers. None of the OA articles were self-selected; authors did not choose
to deposit the articles in question in Deep Blue, since they were opened via blanket licensing
agreements between the publishers and the library.
By comparing citations to subscriber-only/now-open (opened) articles with the correspond-
ing subscriber-only/still-subscriber-only (closed) articles in that journal issue before and after
availability in Deep Blue, we can determine what effect opening them may have had, i.e. a post-
embargo OACA.
The sample began with a random selection of 3,850 papers—peer-reviewed and review arti-
cles only; bibliographies, book reviews, corrections, discussions, editorials, letters, notes, etc.
were not considered—with original publication dates ranging from 1990 to 2013. These were
matched with the 89,895 corresponding articles which remained closed, using the specific jour-
nal issue as a proxy for comparability of subject matter and quality. (It is an imperfect proxy, of
course, but as noted above, in theory each article is unique, so an exact like-for-like comparison
is not possible.) Using data from Thomson Reuters’ Web of Science and Journal Citation
Reports databases, we get actual citations and can calculate the expected values of citations to
an article for each issue. (Some opened articles had no corresponding peer reviewed or review
articles in that issue, and so were dropped from the sample. In issues where more than one
opened article appeared, one was randomly selected to compare with the closed articles.) These
are the important values to compare:

 Oc = citations to opened article, while it was closed
Oo = citations to opened article, once opened
Cc = citations to other (closed) articles in that same issue, for the same period as Oc
Co = citations to those same closed articles, for the same period as Oo
The null hypothesis (H0) is straightforward:
H0 : ActualCitationsafter opening � ExpectedCitationsafter opening ¼ 0
or
H0 : Oo � E ¼ 0
In other words, assume that making an article OA has no effect and test that assumption. As
an example of how a data point was calculated, if the article was opened in 2006 the numbers
might look like this:
Oc = citations to opened article, through 2006 (i.e. citations to it while it was closed) = 20
Oo = citations to opened article, 2007–2014 (now OA) = 25
Cc = citations to other, closed articles in that same issue, through 2006 = 10
Co = citations to other, closed articles, 2007–2014 = 15
To test H0 we need to know how many citations to the opened article we would expect (E) if
it behaved like the other articles in its issue that remained closed. In our example:
E ¼ ðCo=CcÞ � Oc ¼ ð15=10Þ � 20 ¼ 30
so Oo—E = 25–30 = -5, meaning in this case the opened article had five fewer citations than
expected.
Looking at all the articles in aggregate is straightforward and, as described below, doing so
produces large OACA percentages, similar in magnitude to those previously reported. How-
ever, a more appropriate approach is to focus on article-by-article differences, calculated three
ways: each opened article is compared to the mean and median article in the same journal issue
which it appeared in and also to equivalent articles in that issue. Recognizing that other defini-
tions are possible, we define “equivalent articles” as follows:
• If one or more articles had the same number of citations to the opened article while all were
closed, use those articles;
• if not, but there were articles with citation counts during the closed period that bracket that
of the opened article, use those;
• if the opened article had more, or fewer, citations than any other article, use the mean for the
issue as an equivalent (this is conservative, since it will tend to maximize the effect of outliers
among the closed articles).
Regardless of whether we use the median or the equivalent articles to calculate the expected
value, the problem of dealing with never-cited articles comes up. (And it comes up often; in
our sample the modal value for citations for all four groups of articles, Oc through Co, was 0.)
These zeroes were handled as follows:

 If Cc = 0 for medians
E ¼ median Co � median Cc
for equivalents
E ¼ mean of equivalent Cos � mean of equivalent Ccs
Also, if E < 0, be conservative (and realistic) and use 0, as this minimizes differences when
Oc = 0 and Oo > 0.
Analysis
As mentioned above, an aggregate calculation is straightforward: find the overall mean (or
median) values and find the percentage difference between the ratios:
ððOo=OcÞ � ðCo=CcÞÞ=ðCo=CcÞ
The mean values for the sample were Oc = 17.57, Oo = 12.28, Cc = 16.59, Co = 8.55, yielding
an OACA of 35.6%. The median values (Oc = 6, Oo = 5, Cc = 7, Co = 3) produce an even more
impressive OACA of 94.4%.
However, even leaving aside the large standard deviations (ranging from 24.96 to 51.41) of
these aggregate values, we know their distributions are far from normal—again, the mode for
all four values is zero, and no article can have less than zero citations—so an article-by-article
calculation is more appropriate.
The differences between expected values and actual values were usually small. (For the
means, 963/3850 � ±1; for medians 963/3850 � ±1, and; for equivalents 1133/3850 � ±1.)
This is not surprising, given the modes and the conservative treatment of the never-cited arti-
cles described above. Figs 1–3 plot these distributions.
Was there a significant difference, and can we reject H0? Because the sample size is large,
the t- and Z-distributions are reasonable approximations of each other, so applying the usual
formulae for standard deviation to these distributions offers a quantitative measure of the dif-
ference between actual and expected values, and confidence intervals for them. These are as
follows:
Overall (n = 3850)
Oo—Emean = -0.936, σ = 20.13, p < 0.005
Oo—Emedian = 2.271, σ = 19.11, p < 0.0005
Oo—Eequivalent = 0.438, σ = 18.163, p < 0.10
Above median (n = 1882)
Oo—Emean = 0.533, σ = 19.18, p < 0.25
Oo—Emedian = 3.187, σ = 23.80, p < 0.0005
Oo—Eequivalent = 1.124, σ = 19.96, p < 0.01
OACAs are typically presented as percentages; doing so and applying a 99% confidence
level yields:
Overall (n = 3850)
Oo—Emean = -7.6% ± 6.8
Oo—Emedian = 18.5% ± 6.5

5 / 11
 Oo—Eequivalent = 6.8% ± 7.7
As a refinement, we can define an equivalent article more precisely by limiting the difference
between Oc and Cc to � 1%, (i.e., if citations to an opened article and its closed equivalent(s)
differ by more than 1% during the period when both were closed, discard them since they were
not actually similar enough). Doing so gives the following:

 Oo—Eclosest equivalent = 0.580, σ = 10.412, p < 0.10
Oo—Eclosest equivalent = 6.0% ± 10.3
Since the majority of articles in the overall sample were older (82% were more than five
years old and 61% were more than ten years old), per Fig 4, most will have been past their
prime citation years.
So, a further refinement is possible by repeating the analysis for only the newest articles (from
publication to eight years old), and limiting those considered to ones that were closed less than
85% of their lifespan. In this case the aggregate OACA for the mean becomes even larger:
665.9%. (Because the median Oc is zero, the corresponding result for medians is indeterminate.)
However, the results for the granular analysis for this smaller sample are more equivocal:
Overall (n = 416)
Oo—Emean = -8.096, σ = 37.68, p < 0.0005 (i.e., -46.7% ± 27.5)
Oo—Emedian = 3.342, σ = 24.12, p < 0.005 (19.3% ± 17.6)
Oo—Eequivalent = -1.827, σ = 30.30, p < 0.25 (-10.5% ± 22.1)
Above median (n = 92)
Oo—Emean = -24.10, σ = 60.93, p < 0.0005 (-88.8% ± 60.3)
Oo—Emedian = 2.544, σ = 44.19, p < 0.40 (9.4% ± 43.7)
Oo—Eequivalent = -15.10, σ = 56.84, p < 0.01 (-55.6% ± 56.2)
Discussion
We cannot draw conclusions—at least with high confidence—regarding the existence or
absence of an OACA in every scenario; the p-values are too large for Oo—Eequivalent (overall),

 Oo—Emean (above median), Oo—Eclosest equivalent (above median), and Oo—Eequivalent (overall)
and Oo—Emedian (above median) for the newest articles to be confident in those values. Two
things are clear, though.
First, in every case the overall sample the above median articles show a greater gain than the
rest (3.2% > -7.6%, 19.3% > 18.5%, and 6.8% > 3.6%). So, in the long run better articles gain
more citations than expected by being made OA, adding weight to the results reported by Gar-
gouri et al. [3] (This does not appear to hold for the closest equivalents, though their high p-
values make any conclusion about a gain or loss suspect.) Just like the Oo—Emean value, where
we find an open access disadvantage, these data appear intent on preventing us from making
blanket statements.
Second, an OACA appears to exist for all but one case (opened articles compared to all
other articles in the issue), but the confidence intervals are relatively small only in the case
where we compare opened articles to their issue’s medians.
It is arguable that the median is a better control group than the mean, since its use reduces
the influence of outliers, and can correct for a potential bias in the sample as well: the opened
articles come from one institution, and one that enjoys a good reputation for scholarship. So it
is possible that, given that reputation, articles on the borderline of acceptance get more of a
benefit of the doubt during the peer review process. Note, however, that the mean for Oc was
6% more than Cc, while the median was 14% less, so an acceptance bias might be argued either
way.
Taken together, these somewhat equivocal results lead to a short discussion of the limita-
tions of the data, which are available in anonymized form via Deep Blue <deepblue.lib.umich.
edu/data; doi:10.7302/Z2KH0K8V>.
• Though it was not possible here, it is clear that a multi-institution sample would be ideal, as
would a sample not dominated by physical science, health science, and engineering articles
(92% of the total).
• As discussed above, the age of the articles available for study is an additional factor, as the
majority of those studied were past their peak citation years. The results for the medians in
the smaller sample of more recently published articles mirror the broader analysis, but there
appears to be a negative effect on the means. When coupled with the small positive OACA
found for the larger sample, one possibility is that OA mainly extends the shelf-life of
research. Other explanations are possible, of course, but a larger sample of articles—still
young enough themselves, and closed for a short enough time—is needed to demonstrate the
true size of an OACA during an article’s prime.
• With regards to articles being closed for a short enough time, given the evidence that any
embargo reduces citations [10], the ideal would be no time at all. The articles in this sample
were all embargoed during some or all of their prime citation years, so they may not have
achieved their full OA potential.
• The citation counts here are probably conservative. Because the data from Web of Science is
only available on a yearly basis, citations to an opened article (Oo) will always be under-
counted and citations to that same article while closed (Oc) will be over-counted by some
unknown amount. This may not be offset by using a more fine-grained approach for the cor-
responding articles that remained closed during that time.
• Context also matters. While OA repositories are typically well-indexed, making their con-
tents easy to find via e.g. Google searches, opening an article in an institutional repository is
not the same as opening it within the context of the journal itself or via a discipline-specific

 repository. Making an article OA in context(s) more researchers consider a destination for
conducting a literature search would likely produce more citation activity.
There are no doubt others, and despite these limitations, the data suggest additional angles
from which to explore the effects of making articles OA. Some articles had only their meta-
data indexed by Google et al., while others had searchable full text as well. Looking at specific
disciplines, the effect of journal impact factor, and changing the definition of what an equiva-
lent (or closest equivalent) article come immediately to mind as additional avenues worth
exploring.
Conclusion
Removing self-selection bias, considering only published versions of articles, assuring that arti-
cles were open for a long enough time to allow for meaningful citation patterns to emerge, and
working with a large sample address the main weaknesses in previous attempts to show an
OACA.
When treating all the articles in aggregate, this study produced an OACA of comparable
magnitude to previous studies. That large advantage shrinks when articles are treated individu-
ally and compared to close equivalents, but it doesn't disappear. This may be because outliers
skew the results (the rich can always get richer, but there’s a lower limit to how poorly an article
can be cited), or it may be that the best we can do with the data we have is to produce boundary
values for the OACA. So, even though effects found here are more modest than reported else-
where, given the conservative treatments of the data and when viewed in conjunction with
other OACA studies already done [2,12], the results lend support to the existence of a real,
measurable, open access citation advantage with a lower bound of approximately 20%; absent a
large body of published articles available as OA from the moment of publication onward it
may be difficult to say more. The publishing environment we have right now can not provide
such a data set, and will not do so in the foreseeable future. The closest we have today are
hybrid journals, but their OA articles are not only self-selected by authors (presumably because
of higher than normal confidence in their quality), but by authors who have the ability to pay
to assure immediate OA, doubling down on that selection bias.
It is in authors’ best interest to create a more open environment. Combining the results of
treating each article individually with the aggregate numbers for mean-to-mean and median-
to-median comparisons, we see that when an article benefits from being OA, it benefits a lot. In
other words, where there is an OACA it is large relative to the cases where the effect of OA is
zero. Judging by the difference found between the smaller group of newer articles and the over-
all analysis, it’s plausible that OA also extends an article’s impact further into the long tail of
the citation curve. And the better the author, the stronger the interest in open access, since, as
shown by the analysis of above-median articles, OA (unsurprisingly) benefits better articles the
most.
