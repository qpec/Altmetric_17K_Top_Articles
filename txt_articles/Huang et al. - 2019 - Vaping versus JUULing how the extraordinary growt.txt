Abstract
Background—While national surveys showed declines in e-cigarette use in the US between 
2015 and 2016, recent reports indicate that JUUL, a sleekly-designed e-cigarette that looks like a 
USB drive, is increasingly being used by youth and young adults. However, the extent of JUUL’s 
growth and its marketing strategy have not been systematically examined.
Methods—A variety of data sources were used to examine JUUL retail sales in the US and its 
marketing and promotion. Retail store scanner data were used to capture the retail sales of JUUL 
and other major e-cigarette brands for the period 2011–2017. A list of JUUL-related keywords was 
used to identify JUUL-related tweets on Twitter; to identify JUUL-related posts, hashtags, and 
accounts on Instagram; and to identify JUUL-related videos on YouTube.
Results—In the short three-year period 2015–17, JUUL has transformed from a little-known 
brand with minimum sales into the largest retail e-cigarette brand in the US, lifting sales of the 
entire e-cigarette category. Its $150 million retail sales in the last quarter of 2017 accounted for 
about 40% of e-cigarette retail market share. While marketing expenditures for JUUL were 
moderate, the sales growth of JUUL was accompanied by a variety of innovative, engaging, and 
wide-reaching campaigns on Twitter, Instagram, and YouTube, conducted by JUUL and its 
affiliated marketers.
Conclusions—The discrepancies between e-cigarette sales data and the prevalence of e-cigarette 
use from surveys highlight the challenges in tracking and understanding the use of new and 
emerging tobacco products. In a rapidly-changing media environment, where successful and 
influential marketing campaigns can be conducted on social media at little cost, marketing

Introduction
Use of electronic cigarettes has increased rapidly over the past decade in the US, particularly 
among youth [1,2] – a development that raised significant public health concerns about the 
creation of a new generation of nicotine dependency.[3,4] E-cigarette devices that youth 
prefer have also evolved substantially over time: from early-generation cigalike e-cigarettes; 
to more advanced modifiable tank-style e-cigarettes;[5] to the recent emergence of a 
sophisticated, sleekly-designed, discreet high-tech device called JUUL[6] – a flat, 
rectangular portable e-cigarette device fashioned to look like a computer flash drive and 
rechargeable at a USB port.[7] A JUUL has two basic components: the device, which 
includes a battery and temperature regulation system, and the prefilled e-liquid cartridge, 
called a “JUULpod,” which also serves as the mouthpiece. JUUL is manufactured to be a 
closed system, i.e. nonmodifiable. [6–8] JUUL and its competitors, such as Suorin e-
cigarettes, are colloquially known as “pod vaporizers” or “vape pods.” JUUL is made by the 
San Francisco-based JUUL Labs Inc., which was founded in early 2017 by two former 
Stanford graduate students as a spinoff of the Pax Labs, manufacturers of the hybrid Pax 
brand vaporizers.[8]
Recent news is abuzz with the stories of JUUL’s striking appeal to teens and the dramatic 
increase in JUUL use among the youth population since its mid-2015 market debut.[9–14] A 
2017 survey reported that 8% of American youth and young adults (aged 15–24 years) used 
JUUL in the 30 days prior to the survey.[15] The reported popularity of JUUL among youth 
has prompted enforcement actions from FDA to stop youth use of, and access to, JUUL and 
other e-cigarettes.[16] The characteristics that purportedly make JUUL more popular among 
youth than its predecessors include its trendy design (called the “iPhone of e-cigarettes”)
[17]; youth-friendly flavors like Fruit Medley and Crème Brulee; and JUUL’s discreet 
profile – teens even report having vaped in class.[18,19] JUUL is reported to contain high 
levels of nicotine (0.7 mL or 59 mg/mL per pod) and uses a proprietary e-liquid formula 
(JUULsalts™) based on the nicotine salts found in leaf-based tobacco rather than free-based 
nicotine.[20] Consequently, JUUL is said to deliver a nicotine peak in about five minutes, 
and can create an experience more like combustible cigarette smoking than found with other 
e-cigarettes on the market,[21] an attribute appealing to both young and adult smokers.[7]
Previous research demonstrated that the rapid growth in e-cigarette use was accompanied by 
a marked increase in advertising and promotion.[22–24] Similarly, several news articles have 
covered JUUL’s marketing.[7,25] Concerns have been voiced regarding the youth of the 
men and women portrayed in JUUL’s advertising in combination with the product design, 
which critics believe “misleads about risk” of addiction.[26] JUUL is also highly discussed

 on social media platforms such as Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, and Reddit.[7,27] Because 
the audiences of these platforms disproportionately represent youth and young adults,[28] 
JUUL’s marketing and promotion on social media may increase the appeal, experimentation, 
initiation and use of JUUL among that population.
Despite the intense interest in JUUL, studies that document the extent and rate of JUUL’s 
growth, either in absolute sales value or in comparison with other major e-cigarette brands, 
have been scarce. In addition, research on JUUL marketing, particularly among new media 
platforms, has been limited. Our study aims to fill these critical gaps in the literature by 
providing a comprehensive examination of the growth and marketing of JUUL, and their 
implications for public health policy and research on e-cigarettes and e-cigarette marketing.
Methods
Retail Store Scanner Data
Retail sales data for JUUL and other e-cigarette brands for the period 2011 – 2017 were 
obtained from the US retail store scanner data compiled by the Nielsen Company. These 
data represent quarterly sales of e-cigarettes in Nielsen’s participating retailers, which 
include food, drug, and mass stores in 52 US markets and convenience stores in a subset of 
those markets. For each e-cigarette brand, the Nielsen data include sales of branded devices 
and branded e-liquid, cartridges, and refills. Nielsen retail sales data do not include e-
cigarette sales in non-participating retailers, vape shops, and online e-cigarette sales.
Marketing Expenditures
Marketing expenditure data for JUUL were obtained from Kantar Media, which tracks US 
advertising across media channels including television, print, radio, and internet. We used 
the keywords “JUUL,” “JUULvapor,” “JUULpod,” “JUULpods,” and “JUUL labs” to query 
product name, product manufacturer, and product category in the Kantar Media Marketing 
Expenditure database. For product categories that we deemed highly likely to include JUUL 
products, such as ‘smoking materials and accessories,’ we manually reviewed each product 
for relevance. JUUL marketing expenditures data were available from the second quarter of 
2015 through the second quarter of 2017. Marketing expenditures were broken down by 
media channel. Kantar Media marketing expenditures data do not include promotional 
expenditures to retailers at point-of-sale (POS) and direct promotional expenditures to 
consumers.
Twitter Data
The number of JUUL-related tweets were obtained from the Twitter Historic Power Track, 
which provides access to 100% of all archived tweets, as well as metadata associated with 
each tweet. Since JUUL was introduced in mid-2015, tweets were collected for the period 
January 2015 to December 2017. Tweets related to JUUL were identified and collected 
using a search query rule that specified the tweet or account/profile name containing the text 
string “JUUL,” regardless of capitalization or position. Irrelevant tweets, such as those in 
which JUUL is used as a person’s last name, were excluded from our analysis. The English 
language filter was used in collecting JUUL-related tweets.

 Instagram Data
JUUL-related Instagram accounts/profiles were identified from Instagram 
(www.instagram.com) using a search query rule that specified the account/profile name 
containing the text string “JUUL,” regardless of capitalization or position. For each account/
profile, the number of posts, number of followers, and number of accounts they follow were 
recorded and updated through February 15, 2018. In addition, we identified JUUL-related 
hashtags by using a search query rule that specified the hashtags containing the text string 
“JUUL,” regardless of capitalization or position. The total number of posts as of February 
15, 2018 using each hashtag was recorded. Due to the large number of hashtags related to 
JUUL, we only included those hashtags that had at least 500 posts in our analysis. Two 
coauthors reviewed all the posts published by the official JUUL Instagram account 
(Juulvapor) and identified eight themes. Two independent coders then coded whether each 
Juulvapor post fell into one of these eight themes: “flavor images,” “product images,” 
“customer feedback/testimony,” “lifestyle appeal images,” “fashion images,” “sponsored 
events,” “cartoon images,” and “celebrity/model images.” The inter-rater reliability was high 
(Cohen’s k = 0.91). The discrepancies between the two raters were adjudicated by the two 
coauthors who identified these themes. In addition, we noted whether the post was a static 
picture, a GIF picture, or a short video. We also recorded the number of likes and comments 
for each post.
YouTube Data
Top-viewed (# of views > 100,000) JUUL-related YouTube videos, as of March 1, 2018, 
were identified from YouTube (www.youtube.com) using the keywords “JUUL,” 
“JUULing,” “JUULvapor,” “JUULpod,” “JUULpods,” “JUULtips,” and “JUULlabs.” The 
unique URL, title, number of likes and dislikes, and the post date for each video were 
recorded. Two coauthors watched all top-viewed videos and identified three major themes – 
“product review videos,” “product modification videos,” and “lifestyle videos.” Two 
independent coders then watched each video and double-coded the videos into these three 
themes. The age category of the persons appearing in each video was also recorded. The 
inter-rater reliability was 0.93 (Cohen’s k). The discrepancies between the two raters were 
adjudicated by the senior author. In addition, we recorded the gender and number of people 
appearing in each video.
Results
Sales and Growth of JUUL
Figure 1 documents the growth of JUUL retail sales, in comparison with other major e-
cigarette brands, in Nielsen-tracked retail stores. E-cigarette retail sales overall have 
increased significantly since 2011: quarterly e-cigarette retail sales were about $19 million 
in the first quarter of 2011, which increased to $409 million at the end of 2017. Aggregated 
annual e-cigarette retail sales increased 16% between 2015 and 2016 (from $775 million to 
$896 million), and increased 47% between 2016 and 2017 (from $896 million to $1,318 
million). Despite dips in a few quarters, the long-term e-cigarette retail sales trend has been 
on an upward trajectory. This long-term upward trend appears to have accelerated in 2017.

 There were four key growth periods between 2011 and 2017. The first occurred at the 
beginning of 2012, with growth driven by a variety of different e-cigarette brands. The 
second growth period occurred at the beginning of 2013, driven primarily by growth in the 
Blu and Njoy brands. The third occurred in the third quarter of 2014, driven by growth in 
Vuse brand; and the last occurred at the second quarter of 2017, driven exclusively by 
growth in sales of JUUL.
JUUL has changed the landscape of the e-cigarette retail market in the US. Because of 
JUUL’s growth, the e-cigarette brands owned by the tobacco industry, which had dominated 
the e-cigarette retail market since 2013, no longer had the majority of the market share at the 
end of 2017. JUUL’s fast growth contrasted dramatically with the e-cigarette brands owned 
by the tobacco industry, whose retail sales had stagnated since 2015. With quarterly retail 
sales exceeding $100 million and annual retail sales exceeding $650 million, JUUL is now 
the largest e-cigarette brand measured by retail sales, taking up more than half the e-
cigarette retail market share.[29]
Marketing Expenditures for JUUL
Marketing expenditures for JUUL from 2015 to 2017 in media channels tracked by Kantar 
Media are shown in Table 1. Kantar recorded $2.1 million spent on JUUL marketing 
between 2015 and 2017. While this figure is significant, it pales in comparison with 
marketing expenditures for other e-cigarette brands. For example, Vuse spending on 
television marketing alone in 2015 and 2016 exceeded $16 million.
In 2015, Kantar recorded $1.6 million spent on marketing by JUUL. The largest spending 
category was Internet display, upon which JUUL spent a little over $1 million. JUUL also 
spent slightly more than $.5 million on radio advertising in 2015. The total JUUL marketing 
expenditures recorded by Kantar decreased substantially from 2015 to 2016, with recorded 
marketing expenditures in 2016 representing less than one-third those in 2015. While 
spending on business-to-business (B2B) and outdoor advertising doubled, the drastic 
decrease in spending on Internet display and radio was particularly noticeable. The marked 
decline in tracked marketing expenditures continued into 2017. In the first half of 2017, 
JUUL spent no recorded money on major advertising channels tracked by Kantar, and spent 
only about $20K on B2B advertising.
JUUL on Twitter
Figure 2 presents the number of JUUL-related tweets gathered from Twitter between 2015 
and 2017. There were scarcely any JUUL-related tweets in 2015 (8,416 total captured 
tweets, with a monthly average of 765). The number of JUUL-related tweets increased 
substantially in 2016, with a total of 21,292 captured tweets and a monthly average of 1,774 
– more than double the number in 2015. The number of JUUL-related tweets exploded in 
2017, with the total reaching 366,786 and a monthly average of 30,565, 17 times the 2016 
levels. In comparing Figure 2 with Figure 1, the growth trend in JUUL tweets noticeably 
tracks well the growth in JUUL retail sales; the two data series were highly correlated, with 
a correlation coefficient of 0.968. Importantly, an Ordinary Least Square regression that

 regressed JUUL quarterly sales on the number of JUUL-related tweets revealed that the 
number of tweets alone accounted for 93% of variation in JUUL sales in retail stores.
In addition, the official JUUL Twitter account (@JUULvapor) had tweeted more than 4,800 
posts on Twitter, the vast majority of which were posted since June 2017. The account had 
more than 12,300 Twitter followers as of February 28, 2018.
JUUL on Instagram
We identified seven major JUUL-related Instagram accounts (Supplemental Table 1). The 
official JUUL account on Instagram is Juulvapor, with 129 posts and 32,300 followers as of 
February 15, 2018. The other six JUUL-related accounts were created by online retailers that 
sell JUUL-related products such as devices, pods, device skins, and accessories. The account 
with the most posts was “Doit4juul,” a social media campaign initiated by online vendor 
EonSmoke (https://www.eonsmokecom), which called upon its followers to share pictures or 
videos on their own social media accounts that document their experience using JUUL. This 
campaign has proved highly successful. The “Doit4juul” account had 81,800 followers and 
was the most-followed JUUL account on Instagram as of February 15, 2018. In addition, as 
shown below, one of the “Doit4juul” YouTube videos was one of the most viewed JUUL-
related videos on YouTube, with more than 191,438 views as of March 1, 2018. One of the 
Instagram accounts (Juul.girls) specifically targets women and girls. Taken together, these 7 
JUUL-related accounts had 4,230 total posts with over a quarter of a million followers 
(278,172).
We also identified 14 JUUL-related Instagram hashtags with at least 500 posts and the 
number of posts associated with each hashtag (Supplemental Table 2). Those hashtags 
include terms that relate to JUUL devices, JUUL pods, JUUL vendors, and the term that 
refers to the act of using JUUL – JUULing. The total number of posts associated with these 
14 hashtags was 112,864; however, because one post is usually associated with multiple 
hashtags, many of these posts may be the same.
Careful examination of the 129 posts by Juulvapor, the official JUUL Instagram account, 
revealed (Supplemental Table 3) that the vast majority of posts (117 of 129) fell into one of 
four categories: “lifestyle appeal” (pictures/videos of JUUL that evoke feelings of certain 
lifestyles such as relaxation, freedom, sex appeal, etc.), “product images,” “customer 
feedback/testimonies,” and “flavor images.” The 38 posts in the “product images” category 
had the most likes among all categories, with 42,687 likes. The “lifestyle appeal” category 
was the second most popular, with 43 posts and 27,352 likes. Taken together, these posts had 
a total of 7,735 comments. An overwhelming majority of posts (123 of 129) were static 
pictures, rather than GIFs or videos. Most of the posts were posted in 2017 and 2018.
JUUL on YouTube
Our search query to retrieve JUUL-related videos on YouTube yielded more than 132,000 
results as of March 1, 2018. However, after two independent coders watched and coded a 
random sample of 100 videos returned, we found that only 81 of the 100 videos were about 
JUUL e-cigarettes. This finding indicated that only about 80% of the 132,000 total videos 
(or about 106,000) were likely to be related to JUUL e-cigarettes.

 As of March 1, 2018, there were 35 YouTube JUUL-related videos that had views over 
100,000. We watched and coded the characteristics of all 35 JUUL YouTube videos 
(Supplemental Table 4). In total, these 35 videos had 8,297,023 views and had garnered 
51,294 likes and 5,808 dislikes. Twenty of the 35 were about “product reviews,” i.e. one or 
more persons in the video were depicted reviewing JUUL or its related products. 
Interestingly, despite JUUL being a closed system (i.e. nonmodifiable) e-cigarette, a dozen 
(12) of the videos were about how to “modify” the JUUL device (for use of other substance), 
charger, and/or pods (so that they become refillable). One video was about the “Doit4juul” 
campaign; one showed a group of surfers chatting about JUUL; and one video was a news 
report. In 23 of these videos, the persons appearing in the video were either youth or young 
adults. The persons appearing in the videos were predominantly male (28 of 35). A vast 
majority of the videos were posted in 2017 (25 of 35). One video was posted in 2015, one in 
2018, and eight in 2016.
Summary and Discussion
Our study has several key findings with important implications for tobacco use surveillance 
systems, public policies targeting e-cigarettes, and research related to marketing and 
promotion of new and emerging tobacco products.
First, our analysis shows that aggregated e-cigarette retail sales increased substantially 
between 2015 and 2017 in the US, thanks largely to the growth of JUUL. JUUL is now the 
largest e-cigarette retail brand in the US, accounting for more than half of the market share 
in tracked retail channels. JUUL has become so popular that its use has spawned a new verb 
– JUULing.[14]
Our finding that retail sales of e-cigarettes – and JUUL in particular – increased substantially 
between 2015 and 2016 contrasts with population prevalence estimates of e-cigarette use 
from nationally representative surveys. For example, recent CDC reports found that use of e-
cigarettes decreased among both US youth and adults between 2015 and 2016 (from 3.5% to 
3.2% among adults, and from 16.0% to 11.3% among youth). [1,30,31] While it is possible 
that those who use e-cigarettes may have increased the amount and frequency of their 
consumption, this factor alone is unlikely to explain the substantial growth in retail e-
cigarette sales during this period. The discrepancy between retail sales data and population 
prevalence estimates may be due, in part, to the failure of existing surveillance systems to 
capture use of JUUL and other new and emerging tobacco products. Current tobacco use 
surveillance systems, which rely heavily on traditional annual nationally representative 
surveys, are ill-equipped to capture the rapid development of new products. While major 
tobacco surveys (such as the National Health Interview Survey, the National Adult/Youth 
Tobacco Survey, and the Monitoring the Future survey) have added questions about e-
cigarettes since 2014, they ask no specific questions about JUUL and other new/emerging 
tobacco products. In addition, many teens and young adults who vape do not identify as 
smokers or e-cigarette users.[32] Our study highlights the challenges of tracking tobacco use 
behaviors and tobacco product development in a rapidly-changing tobacco market.

 Importantly, our study shows that the growth of JUUL was accompanied by innovative 
marketing across a variety of new media platforms. The marketing of other major retail e-
cigarette brands, at least in their early stages, relied heavily on either advertising on TV (e.g. 
Blu and Njoy)[33] or promotional expenditures to retailers and consumers (e.g. Vuse and 
MarkTen),[34] or both. However, JUUL was one of the first major retail e-cigarette brands 
that relied heavily on social media to market and promote its products. In particular, we 
found the number of JUUL-related tweets was highly correlated with quarterly retail sales of 
JUUL. In addition to Twitter, JUUL was heavily marketed and promoted on Instagram and 
YouTube. The official JUUL account on Instagram, for example, used a variety of marketing 
and promotional schemes to attract, engage with, and retain followers. The account used 
artsy, professional-grade photographs to display its products and evoke lifestyle feelings 
such as relaxation, freedom, and sex appeal. Those posts also heavily emphasized JUUL’s 
variety of flavors. Related accounts heavily marketed and promoted JUUL and associated 
products including pods, skins, and accessories. The seven JUUL-related Instagram accounts 
identified in this study have amassed over a quarter million followers. Additionally, the 
number of JUUL-related YouTube videos exceeded 100,000 as of March 1, 2018 and 
engagement with the videos was high. In addition to Twitter, Instagram and YouTube, a 
recent study found more than 15,000 members discussed JUUL-related themes on Reddit.
[27]
Our study also found innovative, cross-platform marketing campaigns to promote JUUL 
such as “Doit4juul.” Smaller, targeted campaigns such as Juul.girls also had a large presence 
across platforms. Our study reveals affiliate marketing [24,35,36] as an important 
promotional method for JUUL on social media. Such marketing appears as Instagram 
accounts created by online vendors and product reviews on YouTube. While we cannot 
verify whether individuals are paid for their JUUL reviews, one young adult reportedly made 
thousands a month for vaping and reviewing vaping devices on YouTube.[25]
This study has several limitations. First, JUUL retail sales data only capture sales in Nielsen-
participating retailers. Those data do not include sales in non-participating retailers or sales 
occurred online or in vape shops. Therefore, our data underestimate total JUUL sales in the 
US. To the extent that online sales may represent a large proportion of total JUUL sales, 
particularly in its early stage, the growth rate constructed from retail sales may overestimate 
JUUL’s total growth rate. Second, the marketing expenditure data tracked by Kantar do not 
include point-of-sale (POS) marketing and promotional expenditures, and the direct 
promotional expenditures to consumers. For cigarettes, POS promotional expenditures to 
retailers represented the largest category of marketing expenditures.[37] This could be true 
for JUUL as well. As JUUL expanded its presence in retail stores, its marketing expenditure 
may have shifted from spending on advertising to promotional expenditures at POS. Third, 
the keywords we used to retrieve JUUL-related content on social media have high precision; 
however, they may not recall the entire corpus of JUUL-related content. Fourth, while our 
study provides an overview of marketing and promotion of JUUL on Twitter, Instagram, and 
YouTube, due to limited time and resources, we did not conduct in-depth content analyses of 
the entire corpus of tweets, posts, and videos related to JUUL. Future research can help 
identify the major themes/topics and sources of JUUL-related content on social media, and 
identify to what extent JUUL-related discourse on social media was organic vs. commercial.

 In addition, due to the privacy settings and complexity of retrieving data from Facebook, we 
did not survey JUUL-related content on that platform.
Despite these limitations, our findings have important implications for research and policy. 
Our analysis suggests that tobacco use surveillance systems should incorporate innovative 
methods (e.g. social media and big data) to capture new and emerging tobacco products in a 
rapidly-evolving market. In addition, our results indicate that marketing expenditures, the 
conventional measure of marketing influence, may no longer fully capture the extent, reach, 
and influence of marketing and promotion for new and emerging tobacco products. The 
decrease in marketing expenditures for JUUL over time masks its highly-successful, 
influential, engaging, wide-reaching campaigns on social media. In fact, our analyses show 
that JUUL’s social media activities were highly correlated with JUUL retail sales. Targeted 
cross-platform social media campaigns, although they cost little, can have substantial 
influence on people’s attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors related to these products.

 What This Paper Adds
•
Recent nationally representative surveys indicate declines in e-cigarette use 
between 2015 and 2016 in the U.S. However, these surveys may have failed to 
capture the use of a relatively new product, JUUL.
•
We systematically document the extent and rate of growth in JUUL retail 
sales and market share since the product’s debut in mid-2015. We also 
examine JUUL’s marketing strategies, influence, and reach on a variety of 
social media platforms.
