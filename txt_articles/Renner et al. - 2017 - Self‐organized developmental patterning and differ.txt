Abstract
Cerebral organoids recapitulate human brain development at a
considerable level of detail, even in the absence of externally
added
signaling
factors.
The
patterning
events
driving
this
self-organization are currently unknown. Here, we examine the
developmental and differentiative capacity of cerebral organoids.
Focusing on forebrain regions, we demonstrate the presence of a
variety of discrete ventral and dorsal regions. Clearing and subse-
quent 3D reconstruction of entire organoids reveal that many of
these regions are interconnected, suggesting that the entire range
of dorso-ventral identities can be generated within continuous
neuroepithelia. Consistent with this, we demonstrate the presence
of forebrain organizing centers that express secreted growth
factors, which may be involved in dorso-ventral patterning within
organoids. Furthermore, we demonstrate the timed generation of
neurons with mature morphologies, as well as the subsequent
generation of astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. Our work provides
the methodology and quality criteria for phenotypic analysis of
brain organoids and shows that the spatial and temporal pattern-
ing events governing human brain development can be recapitu-
lated in vitro.

Introduction
Our current understanding of mammalian brain development is
largely derived from studies in animal models, particularly rodents.
These studies have shed light on a variety of processes underlying
brain patterning, neurogenesis, and neuronal positioning and matu-
ration (Taverna et al, 2014). How these processes are conserved in
humans and how they are modified to explain the enormous
increase in size and complexity in the human brain, however, is
much less clear (Lui et al, 2011; Geschwind & Rakic, 2013).
To overcome this problem and to model human neurodevelopmen-
tal disorders, multiple 3D culture systems have recently been developed
that allow the recapitulation of human brain development in vitro
starting from pluripotent stem cells (PSCs; Eiraku et al, 2008; Mariani
et al, 2012; Kadoshima et al, 2013; Pas
�ca et al, 2015). Such in vitro
systems have great potential for revealing the human-specific aspects
of formation of particular brain regions, but the extent to which these
isolated brain regions model overall patterning is limited.
We have recently developed a 3D culture model termed cerebral
organoids (Lancaster et al, 2013) that can recapitulate many aspects
of brain development, including the establishment of discrete regions
of the central nervous system (retina, forebrain, and choroid plexus),
organized germinal zones, and both radial and tangential migration
of cortical neuron populations. Unlike other protocols (Eiraku et al,
2008; Chambers et al, 2009; Kadoshima et al, 2013; Mariani et al,
2015; Pas
�ca et al, 2015; Qian et al, 2016), cerebral organoids are not
patterned by externally added growth factors or morphogens,
suggesting that their development relies purely on self-organization.
In vivo, the developing forebrain is patterned by morphogen
gradients secreted from organizing centers within the forebrain
(Borello & Pierani, 2010). After neural tube closure, three main
signaling centers determine forebrain anterior–posterior and dorsal–
ventral patterning. Rostrally, the anterior neural ridge secretes Fgf8
family molecules. At the midline of the cortical hemispheres, the
cortical hem secretes Wnts (Wnt2b, Wnt3a, Wnt5a) and Bmps
(Bmp2, Bmp4, Bmp6, Bmp7). The cortical hem regulates dorsal–ventral

 patterning of the cerebral cortex by promoting dorsal forebrain and
repressing ventral forebrain identity (Caronia-Brown et al, 2014).
Opposite to the hem, at the sharp boundary between dorsal and
ventral telencephalon, the pallial–subpallial boundary (PSPB) or
antihem separates dorsal from ventral forebrain. Cells at the PSPB
express the soluble Wnt inhibitor Sfrp2, Fgf7, and the EGF-like
factors, Tgf alpha, Nrg1, and Nrg3 (O’Leary et al, 2007; Medina &
Abella
´n, 2009; Subramanian et al, 2009; Grove & Monuki, 2013).
Following establishment of these key morphogenetic boundaries,
neural progenitors begin to generate neurons of specific identities
following a precise temporal program (Molyneaux et al, 2007). The
first neurons to populate the dorsal cortex are the Cajal–Retzius
cells, which are generated in regions adjacent to the cortex including
hem and PSPB and then migrate into the early preplate of the cortex.
Subsequently, neurons are generated from radial glia in an inside-
out manner with deep-layer identities being generated early, and
superficial identities being generated later. Finally, forebrain neural
stem cells terminate their divisions by producing glial identities
including astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. While this pattern of
development is highly stereotypical across mammals, the extent to
which these spatial and temporal patterning events can be recapitu-
lated in vitro is currently unknown.
In contrast to actual organs, organoids lack externally recogniz-
able body axes that guide their gross morphogenesis and help with
phenotypic analysis. Therefore, cerebral organoids require careful
analysis to decipher regional identities and spatial organization.
Here, we systematically analyze regional identity in cerebral orga-
noids using established markers to reveal discrete dorsal and ventral
forebrain regions. We show that variability within organoid cultures
can be addressed by using a critical marker set during the analysis of
development. This approach, along with clearing of organoids to
determine the overall 3D arrangement, reveals that major forebrain
signaling centers are present within organoids and neuronal and glial
differentiation occurs in a timed manner matching that seen in vivo.

Forebrain regional specification in cerebral organoids
Cerebral organoids form complex tissues of variable identities.
However, because tissues appear somewhat randomly distributed
throughout
the
organoids,
and
without
body
axes
as
a
neuroanatomical guide, it can be difficult to unambiguously identify
specific brain regions. We therefore researched numerous markers
of brain regional identity and cross-checked them for consistency
between mouse and human brain development (Eurexpress and
BrainSpan; Geffers et al, 2012; Miller et al, 2014). In vivo, the
forebrain is subdivided into various distinct regions that assume
stereotypic positions along the dorso-ventral (D/V) and medio-lateral
axes (Sanes et al, 2011). The choroid plexus forms at the most
medial–dorsal site, followed by the developing hippocampus and
dorsal cortex. Laterally, the cortex abuts the ventral forebrain that
comprises
the
ganglionic
eminences
(GE)
during
embryonic
development. The GE is the major source of cortical interneurons. It
is subdivided into medial, lateral, and caudal ganglionic eminences
(LGE, MGE, CGE) that can be distinguished by marker expression
and
morphology
(Hansen
et al,
2013;
Ma
et al,
2013).
We
ascertained a set of markers that are specific for these subregions
and were used for subsequent analyses either in isolation or in
combination with other markers (summarized in Fig 1A).
A hallmark of the cerebral organoid approach is the formation of
large continuous forebrain tissues (here defined as radially orga-
nized tissues greater than 400 lm in diameter) containing well-
defined progenitor zones and neuronal populations. Our analysis
was restricted to those regions as they are structurally more similar
to the developing human brain and better defined than small neural
rosettes that can also form within cerebral organoids. To determine
the D/V identity of the forebrain tissues (forebrain identity was con-
firmed by staining for FOXG1: Fig EV1), we performed a series of
immunohistochemical stainings. We stained for PAX6, widely
considered a dorsal cortical marker (Georgala et al, 2011; Shi et al,
2012) and the more definitive dorsal forebrain marker TBR2. PAX6
is expressed in radial glial progenitors in the ventricular zone (VZ),
and these radial glia give rise to intermediate progenitor cells, which
downregulate PAX6, express TBR2, and move to the subventricular
zone (SVZ; Englund, 2005). Besides regions with cortical morphol-
ogy containing both PAX6- and TBR2-positive cells in the typical
VZ–SVZ arrangement (Fig 1B; Lancaster et al, 2013), we detected
many PAX6-positive but TBR2-negative tissues with typical radial
VZ organization (Fig 1D). Although these regions were morphologi-
cally indistinguishable from dorsal forebrain, subsequent staining
for GSX2 confirmed their ventral GE identity, more specifically LGE
or CGE (Fig 1D and E). Notably, when separate GSX2+ and TBR2+
regions were present within a single organoid, PAX6 staining
revealed a lower level of expression in GSX2+ regions, consistent
with the in vivo pattern (Georgala et al, 2011). However, in orga-
noids without TBR2+ dorsal regions with high PAX6 as a reference,
PAX6 staining alone or in combination with morphology is not suffi-
cient to assign dorsal cortex identity in brain organoid models.
Thus, cerebral organoids contain both dorsal and ventral forebrain
regions with organized progenitor zones and regional identity needs
to be confirmed by careful marker stainings.
To further characterize the GSX2-positive GE regions, we used the
MGE marker NKX2.1. NKX2.1 staining in radially organized tissues
was very rare and overlapped with GSX2 where it probably marked
the transition from LGE to MGE, a pattern also seen in vivo (Fig 1F).
In vivo, the GE generates interneurons that migrate tangentially into
the dorsal forebrain (Hansen et al, 2013; Ma et al, 2013). Indeed, GE
regions in organoids not only contained abundant DLX2-positive
intermediate progenitors and young neurons (Fig 1G), but were also
surrounded by abundant VGAT-positive GABAergic interneurons
(Fig 1H). Consistent with previous observations (Lancaster et al,
2013), interneurons were also found in dorsal forebrain regions
(Fig 1I, arrows) in the majority of organoids containing dorsal regions
(Table EV1). However, in two organoids of almost exclusively dorsal
identity, we did not find interneurons, which could be due to the
absence of a ventral region. Thus, the interaction of regions with
different cortical identities is preserved in organoid models.
In addition to ventral GE, cerebral organoids also contained the
medial parts of the dorsal forebrain, the choroid plexus, and in rare
cases hippocampus (Lancaster et al, 2013). Choroid plexus (CP)
stained positive for the CP marker TTR (Fig 1J). Live imaging of
choroid plexus tissue revealed small unidirectionally moving parti-
cles, indicating that circulation of the surrounding liquid by CP cilia
is preserved in organoids (Fig EV1 and Movie EV1). Hippocampal

 tissues stained positive for the dorsal forebrain markers PAX6 and
TBR2 (Fig EV1) and the hippocampal markers PROX1, FZD9, and
NRP2 (Fig 1K). Thus, both lateral and medial cortical tissues can be
uniquely identified in organoids.

 regions in 104 organoids from 22 distinct experiments. For this,
we generated 20-lm sections spanning the entire volume of each
organoid in 200-lm intervals. Only tissues containing radially
organized regions of more than 400 lm end-to-end diameter were
analyzed (Fig 2A arrows; smaller rosettes, marked with “x”, were
disregarded; FOXG1 staining was used to determine forebrain
identity, Fig EV1). Importantly, we only processed organoids that
passed the quality criteria previously described (Lancaster &
Knoblich, 2014), namely clearing of EB borders before transfer to
neural induction medium, formation of radially organized neuroep-
ithelium in neural induction medium before Matrigel embedding,
and outgrowth and development of defined buds in Matrigel
without massive cyst formation and/or complete overgrowth by
migratory cells.
We imaged the entire volume of each organoid by an automated
slide scanner and identified dorsal forebrain as tissue containing a
radially organized VZ and staining positive for both PAX6 and
TBR2, or FOXG1 and TBR2 (Fig 2B and C). We found large dorsal
forebrain tissues in 16 out of 22 experiments (Fig 2D). Of these, 12
experiments displayed large dorsal regions to varying degrees, while
four experiments contained dorsal forebrain tissues larger than
400 lm in all the organoids analyzed. In the six experiments where
we could not find any tissues with large dorsal forebrain, the orga-
noids either generated large radially organized regions with overall
low efficiency or the tissue was of ventral, non-dorsal, or unknown
identity (Fig 2D).
Organoid clearing and 3D imaging reveal tissue interconnectivity
To visualize entire organoids in 3D, we used the recently described
SWITCH protocol (Murray et al, 2015) that allows clearing and
imaging of highly diffractive brain tissue. This enabled an unprece-
dented representation of organoid structure, revealing a high level
of internal tissue connectivity. Most importantly, this experiment
demonstrated that many of the cortical tissues that appeared
isolated in 2D sections were instead part of one large heavily inter-
twined cortical region as they were connected only a few optical
sections later (Fig 2E). We therefore marked all ventricles through-
out the entire organoid and performed 3D reconstruction, revealing
a complex three-dimensional ventricular network within the orga-
noid (Fig 2F and G, and Movie EV2).
These findings suggest that tissues of different dorsal–ventral
forebrain identities might be connected in a single neuroepithelial
structure within organoids. This structural organization may allow
not only for short-distance signaling between forebrain regions, but
also long-distance communication through signaling molecules
secreted into the connected ventricular network. The presence of an
elaborate CP (Fig 2E and F, arrow) attached to large, radially orga-
nized tissues (Fig 2E and F, arrowheads), and our findings that the
CP
generated
unidirectional
flow
(Fig EV1
and
Movie
EV1),
supports this hypothesis.
Cerebral organoids generate forebrain organizing centers
In vivo, the dorsal forebrain is patterned along the dorsal–ventral
axis by two organizing centers: the cortical hem located medially
between the choroid plexus and cortex, and the PSPB or antihem,
separating the cortex from the lateral GE. To address whether orga-
noids contain forebrain organizing centers that could influence the
generation of dorsal and ventral forebrain regions, we performed
immunohistochemistry to identify regions reminiscent of the cortical
hem and the PSPB. To identify PSPB structures, we analyzed the
same set of organoids as in Fig 2D. We identified the PSPB as dorsal
forebrain tissue (PAX6+, TBR2+, GSX2�) directly abutting ventral
forebrain tissue (GSX2+, PAX6+/�, TBR2�; Fig 3A). Indeed in
seven out of 22 experiments, we found several tissues with a sharp
boundary between dorsal and ventral forebrain tissues (Fig 3A and
B). This staining is consistent with the arrangement of a PSPB
(Fig 3C).
To identify hem in cerebral organoids, we performed immuno-
histological experiments using markers for specific brain regions. To
exclude artifacts from mispatterned organoids, we included only
those experiments in which more than 50% of all organoids
contained dorsal forebrain tissue larger than 400 lm in diameter.
Sections adjacent to those large dorsal forebrain regions were
stained for PAX6, LMX1a (Chizhikov et al, 2010), and the choroid
plexus marker TTR. Indeed, in nine experiments analyzed (53 orga-
noids in total, Table EV1), we detected LMX1a-positive cell popula-
tions between the choroid plexus and the dorsal forebrain in several
organoids, recapitulating the organization of the cortical hem
(Fig 3D and E). This might be an underestimate as organoids do not
display an externally visible axis and therefore some hem structures

for analysis if at least one organoid contained radially organized tissue that was > 400 lm in diameter.

 could be missed in the random 2D sections through complex 3D
tissues. When we analyzed the presence of a PSPB in the experi-
ments that were analyzed for cortical hem, we found that 11 out of
53 organoids contained both hem and PSPB tissues. Twenty-one
contained only hem and nine contained only PSPB, while the
remaining 12 organoids contained neither hem nor PSPB (Fig 3F).
These results suggest that organoids are capable of generating struc-
tures reminiscent of forebrain organizing centers.

 The cortical hem has an important signaling function within the
dorsal forebrain. The signaling factor Wnt2b is expressed in a
narrow stripe, while other signaling molecules such as Wnt3a,
Bmp6, and Bmp7 are more dispersed (Grove et al, 1998; Abu-Khalil
et al, 2004). Indeed, using in situ hybridization on serial sections,
we found that Wnt2b was expressed in organoids between the
choroid plexus and the dorsal forebrain (Fig 3G–I, arrows). For
quantification, we used anti-BMP6 staining to be compatible with
immunohistological identification of regional markers. We analyzed
BMP6 expression in experiments in which we could find dorsal fore-
brain tissue larger than 400 lm in diameter in more than 50% of
organoids. BMP6 is expressed in the cortical hem and also choroid
plexus. We analyzed 29 organoids from five independent experi-
ments and found BMP6-positive hem tissue located next to dorsal
forebrain tissue in 79% of them. All of these regions were also posi-
tive for LMX1a in serial sections (Fig EV2).
Thus, cerebral organoids contain the organizing centers that are
involved in patterning the mammalian brain in vivo. Our analysis
shows that they can produce signaling molecules normally present
in those organizers. These morphogens might influence regional
identity both in the immediate vicinity, but also over long distances
through the interconnected ventricular network, although genetic
loss-of-function analysis will be required to demonstrate that corti-
cal patterning in organoids is indeed influenced by the presence of
PSPB or hem tissue.
Timed generation of excitatory neuronal subtypes
Having observed the presence of spatial patterning, we next sought
to test whether brain organoids displayed evidence of temporal
patterning. The developing dorsal cortex in vivo displays remarkable
timing in the generation of the various neuron types that make up
the six layers of the cortex (Rakic, 1974; Hevner et al, 2003;
Molyneaux et al, 2007; Gaspard et al, 2008). Specifically, Cajal–
Retzius cells are generated first in regions adjacent to the cortex,
followed by the sequential generation of deep-layer neurons and
then superficial layer neurons. Therefore, we examined whether
cerebral organoids displayed a similar timed generation of these
excitatory neuron types. We performed staining for the marker of
Cajal–Retzius cells, Reelin, which displayed an abundance of stain-
ing in early organoids (day 42) soon after the initiation of neuro-
genesis followed by a gradual decrease in abundance over time
(Fig 4A). Staining for the deep-layer marker CTIP2 and the superfi-
cial layer marker SATB2 at various time points revealed abundant
CTIP2 cells at day 48, whereas SATB2 neurons were largely absent
at this time point, instead appearing around day 66 and increasing
until day 102 (Fig 4B). We further tested for the presence of cells
with a glial identity, which are believed to be generated lastly from
the terminal divisions of neural stem cells (Sauvageot, 2002). GFAP
staining revealed cells with strong positivity and astrocytic morphol-
ogy beginning at approximately 100 days (Fig 4C). Thus, the rela-
tive emergence of cell types matches that observed in vivo where
Reelin-positive cells are generated first, followed by deep-layer
CTIP2-positive cells, then SATB2-positive superficial layer neurons,
and finally cells with glial identities.
To further characterize this putative temporal patterning, we
quantified the relative abundance of Reelin+, CTIP2+, or SATB2+
neurons, and of GFAP+ cells with astrocytic morphology. We
quantified organoids from 15 separate experiments ranging from 33
to 160 days in culture, with at least four organoids per time point
(quantification summarized in Table EV2). This revealed the highest
abundance of Reelin cells during the earliest time points, followed
by a peak of CTIP+ cells, then SATB2+ neurons, and finally GFAP+
astrocytes (Fig 4D). Finally, we examined the robustness of astro-
cyte generation by quantifying the number of astrocyte-containing
organoids at each time point. We found that this fraction increased
with time until finally by approximately 140 days all of the orga-
noids analyzed displayed at least some astrocytes (Fig 4E).
Neurons and glia adopt mature morphological features
We next examined the morphology of excitatory neurons to estab-
lish whether they displayed typical morphological characteristics of
dorsal cortical excitatory neurons, which are also termed pyramidal
cells due to their triangular cell shape and their primary dendrite
(Elston, 2003). We performed staining for the markers SATB2 and
CTIP2 in combination with the dendritic marker MAP2. Numerous
neurons of the dorsal cortical region displayed thickened dendrites
extending radially outward, much like the primary dendrite typical
of pyramidal cells (Fig 5A). Numerous outer branching dendrites
could also be seen, reminiscent of so-called apical tufts. Imaris trac-
ing of dendrites on a region with sparse staining identified individ-
ual dendritic trees, showing the presence of a primary dendrite and
distal branching (Fig 5B). Furthermore, sparse labeling by electro-
poration with a membrane targeting GFP construct revealed neurons
with thick primary dendrite and extensive distal branching (Fig 5C).
These data suggest excitatory neurons in cerebral organoids are able
to mature and take on the typical morphology seen in vivo.
We further characterized the cells of glial identities by staining
for the broad glial marker GFAP as well as the glutamate transporter
GLT1 which is expressed in astrocytes. Astrocytes were positive for
both markers and displayed typical morphology consisting of
numerous elongated processes (Fig 5D). Furthermore, O4 staining
revealed the presence of oligodendrocytes, which primarily resided
in the central regions of the organoid, where cells were sparse
(Fig 5E). In addition, cells with OLIG1 staining could be identified
consistent with oligodendrocyte identity (Fig 5F). Costaining for
CTIP2 and MAP2 revealed a close association of GFAP-positive
astrocytes and differentiated cortical neurons (Fig 5G). Interestingly,
in addition to astrocytes and oligodendrocytes with typical morphol-
ogy, we also observed highly positive GFAP cells lining the outer
surface of the brain organoids (Fig 5H). Finally, very old organoids
(day 229) were almost entirely populated by glia showing staining
for both GFAP and GLT1 (Fig 5I). Thus, our data indicate that cere-
bral organoids can model the emergence and morphological dif-
ferentiation of glial cells.
Discussion
Our findings demonstrate the remarkable ability of cerebral orga-
noids to self-organize through endogenous patterning events that
mimic the developing brain in vivo. Using detailed marker analysis,
we have shown that cerebral organoids can form distinct forebrain
structures, and we describe the variability and efficiency of genera-
tion of these regions. Furthermore, we identified tissues reminiscent

 of the cortical hem and PSPB, which in vivo have vital functions in
forebrain patterning. In support of this finding, a recent single-cell
transcriptome study also identified cells expressing hem-specific
genes in cerebral organoids (Camp et al, 2015). Although these
tissues resembling organizing centers are formed in cerebral orga-
noids, it remains to be determined whether they play a direct

not nuclear markers, these were instead quantified as cell counts per mm2 of differentiated region (intermediate zone/cortical plate, excluding germinal zones) as
defined by DCX staining (right y-axis). Measurements were binned into six time windows spanning day 30 to day 160. 15 independent experiments were quantified
with at least four organoids from at least two experiments per time window.

 functional role in organoid patterning. Unlike the hem, the antihem
has not been proven to be an organizing center in vivo; however, its
absence leads to a severe disruption of the radial glia progenitor
palisade at the PSPB, raising a strong parallel with the function of
the hem in organizing the hippocampal radial glia progenitor cells
(Subramanian et al, 2009).
Interestingly, our study revealed substantial variability among
organoid experiments in the efficiency of generating dorsal or
ventral forebrain tissue as well as other tissues whose identity we
have not discerned. One hypothesis is that this variability arises
depending on which organizing centers are formed. However,
resolving the relationship between the presence of organizing
centers and regional identity is highly challenging, since by defi-
nition, dorsal forebrain is found next to all identified hem tissues
and dorsal forebrain and ventral forebrain are always curtailing
the PSPB. Furthermore, organizing centers may be active only at
certain developmental stages of individual organoids and might
not be visible during the entire organoid life span, making it diffi-
cult to unambiguously discern which patterning cues are/have
been present. Nonetheless, the fact that we observe formation of
various different, organized tissue identities within the same orga-
noid without providing external signaling molecules suggests that
intrinsic signaling processes and patterning are at work during
organoid development. Future functional studies and manipula-
tions will be required to test whether these regions consistent with
organizing centers are indeed involved in intrinsic patterning of
cerebral organoids.
Making organoids transparent by the recently described SWITCH
method (Murray et al, 2015) and imaging of the entire structure
allowed us to overcome some of the limitations of analysis of 3D
organoids by 2D sections. Our results revealed a significant degree
of tissue interconnectivity, even though the abundance of internal
connections of the ventricular system varied across different orga-
noids. The internal connection of organoids via a ventricular system
has important implications for how we perceive tissue interactions
in 3D. Signaling molecules could travel throughout the organoid,
and tissues that are seemingly separated by long distances based on
histological sections could actually be physically connected and
influence each other.
These results underline the remarkable capacity of pluripotent
stem cell-derived brain tissues to form various forebrain structures
solely by self-organization. This shows that even the highly complex
development of the telencephalon can be carried out to a surpris-
ingly large extent without external signaling cues. Other published
protocols for 3D brain tissue rely on the addition of signaling
molecules to drive induction of defined tissue identities (Eiraku
et al, 2008; Chambers et al, 2009; Kadoshima et al, 2013; Mariani
et al, 2015; Pas
�ca et al, 2015; Qian et al, 2016). This leads to the
formation of homogeneous tissue that lacks crucial interactions of
different brain regions such as the spatial integration of GABAergic
interneurons with excitatory dorsal forebrain neurons. Furthermore,
this may explain the capacity for whole brain organoids to form
larger, more continuous cortical tissues, due to the interconnectivity
with other forebrain regions such as cortical hem, which is
important for cortical expansion in vivo (Caronia-Brown et al, 2014)
or CP, which in vivo generates ventricular cerebral spinal fluid.
Our findings reveal that not only are cerebral organoids capable
of intrinsic spatial patterning, but they also display acquisition of
cell identity in a timed manner that closely mimics the temporal
patterning seen in vivo with sequential waves of neurons expressing
Reelin, CTIP2, and SATB2. While the timing seen in organoids is
overall somewhat slower than that described for 2D cultures
(Gaspard et al, 2008), it is closer to that seen in vivo for the develop-
ing human brain (http://developinghumanbrain.org). Importantly,
while some subtle separation of deep and superficial neurons can be
seen in organoids, overall they do not display the separation into
discrete layers as would be seen in vivo. This may be due to a lack
of later spatial organization into the cortical plate, a prerequisite of
cortical layer formation. Finally, the timed formation of glia further
demonstrates the potential utility of organoids as a route to study
these supportive non-neural types and may even indicate a potential
for myelination.
Although these findings identify a remarkable ability for forma-
tion of organizing centers, due to the spontaneous nature of identity
acquisition, there is quite significant variability from organoid to
organoid and between experiments. We also observed the formation
of regions of non-forebrain identity. While we did not analyze those
regions by marker staining, transcriptome profiling of individual

 cerebral organoids has revealed transcriptional signatures of other
brain regions such as hindbrain and spinal cord, and even other
embryonic tissues such as digestive tract and skeletal system devel-
opment (Lancaster et al, 2016). This underlines the importance of
careful marker stainings to recognize different tissue identities
within 3D brain organoids. This is especially important for studies
in which organoids with different genetic backgrounds are analyzed.
We propose the use of FOXG1 staining as evidence for forebrain
identity and within those tissues TBR2 staining in the SVZ as a
marker for dorsal forebrain. The dependence on molecular markers
published for in vivo studies where identity can be inferred from
morphological landmarks is of course a limitation for further classi-
fication of regional identities within organoids. Currently, this can
be overcome with combinatorial stainings to identify the region of
interest. Further large-scale sequencing efforts such as Kerwin et al
(2010) and Fagerberg et al (2014) will contribute to the identifi-
cation of new region-specific molecular markers in the human
developing brain that can be used in the organoid field.
Materials and Methods
Human embryonic stem cell culture
Human embryonic stem cells H9 [Wisconsin International Stem Cell
(WISC) Bank, WiCell Research Institute, WA09 cells] were cultured
according to WiCell protocols (http://www.wicell.org/home/sup
port/stem-cell-protocols/stem-cell-protocols.cmsx) on MEF feeders
(CF-1 MEF, irradiated, GlobalStem) in hESC medium with bFGF or
on Matrigel (Corning, hESC-Qualified) in mTeSR1 (Stemcell Tech-
nologies).
Generation and analysis of cerebral organoids
Cerebral organoids were generated and processed for analysis as
described in great detail in Lancaster and Knoblich (2014).
Organoids were fixed in 4% PFA for 45–60 min at room tempera-
ture, washed in PBS, and cryoprotected in 30% sucrose in PBS over-
night at 4°C. Three to five organoids were embedded together in
blocks of 7.5% gelatine and 10% sucrose in PB and frozen in �30
to �50°C isopentane. Organoids were cut to 20-lm cryosections,
and every tenth section was collected onto a slide to obtain 10 slides
containing serial sections representing the whole organoid. Slides
were dried and stored at �80°C (long-term storage) or �20°C
(short-term storage).
Immunofluorescence stainings
Slides were thawed, dried, and rehydrated in PBS. Slides were incu-
bated for 1 h in 150 ll blocking/permeabilization solution (0.25%
Triton X, 4% normal donkey serum in PBS) under parafilm. The
sections were incubated overnight at room temperature with 100 ll
primary antibodies in blocking solution (0.1% Triton X, 4% normal
donkey serum in PBS) under parafilm, washed 3 × 15 min in
PBS + 0.05% Triton X, and incubated for 2 h with 1:500 secondary
antibodies (Life Technologies) in blocking solution. Nuclei were
counterstained with 1 lg/ml DAPI in PBS for 15 min, and the slides
were washed in the dark 2 × 15 min in PBS + 0.05% Triton X and
1 × 15 min PBS and mounted with Dako fluorescence mounting
medium. See Table 1 for information on antibodies and dilutions.
Slides were imaged with the Panoramic SCAN slide scanner
(3DHISTECH Ltd.) to obtain a representation of the entire organoids
in 200-lm intervals. For analysis of more than three markers within
the same tissue, or in case of antibody incompatibility, adjacent
sections
on a
neighboring
slide were
stained and
analyzed.
Complete scanning of all samples by the Panoramic SCAN Slide
scanner allowed for comprehensive analysis of many tissues,
stained with a large variety of different antibodies.
Dorsal forebrain tissue as well as ventral forebrain, PSPB, hem,
and choroid plexus (with a diameter > 400 lm) was detected in
organoids at all stages analyzed (30–70 days old). Over time, we
observed an apparent increase in organoids positive for these
regions. Most likely, however, this apparent increase is due to the
loss and/or reduced growth of malformed or mispatterned orga-
noids over time rather than being a true increase in those tissues.
To make up for this bias, organoids from several stages were
combined for this experiment.
Tissue clearing and imaging in 3D
Organoids were fixed in PFA and processed essentially as described
in Murray et al (2015).

 Sparse labeling by GFP electroporation
Cerebral organoids were electroporated as previously described
(Lancaster et al, 2013) with an integrating construct encoding
EGFP containing a farnesylation sequence to enable membrane
targeting (pT2-CAG-fGFP). The CAG promoter was isolated from
pCAG-GFP (a gift from Connie Cepko, Addgene plasmid #11150)
and inserted into the pT2/HB transposon donor plasmid (a gift
from Perry Hackett, Addgene plasmid #26557), which was also
modified to allow the insertion of sequences using Gateway
cloning. A farnesylation sequence was inserted directly after the
GFP of the pENTREGFP2 plasmid (a gift from Nathan Lawson,
Addgene plasmid #22450), and this was then cloned into the
above pT2-CAG-pDest using Gateway cloning (Thermo Fisher).
CAG-driven sleeping beauty transposase plasmid was generated
by cloning SB100X (pCMV(CAT)T7-SB100 was a gift from Zsuz-
sanna Izsvak, Addgene plasmid #34879) into the pCAGEN plas-
mid
(a

Electroporation was performed by injecting 80 ng/ll pT2-Cag-fGFP
and 240 ng/ll pCAGEN-SB100X. Organoids were fixed 2 weeks
later and analyzed as described below for immunohistochemical
analysis.
In situ hybridizations
Probe preparation
Wnt2b was amplified by PCR from human fetal brain cDNA
(Invitrogen). The PCR reaction was diluted 1:500, and nested PCR
was performed in two separate reactions with the forward or
reverse primer containing the T7 site, respectively (Table 2). The
PCR products were gel-purified by the Qiagen Gel Extraction Kit,
and > 300 ng was used for reverse transcription with T7 poly-
merase, DIG-dNTPs, and RNase inhibitor for 4 h at 37°C. The
samples were then incubated for 10 min at 37°C with 1 ll DNase
I (RNase free), and RNA was precipitated with EtOH and NaOAc3
at �20°C for 2 h, pelleted for 20 min at 4°C, washed with 70%
EtOH,
dried,
and

in
50 ll

H2O.
Five microliter was used to check the probe, and the rest was
mixed 1:1 with 100% deionized formamide and stored at �20°C
until use.
Sample preparation and hybridization procedure
Organoids were fixed for 4 h at 4°C in 4% PFA and cryoprotected
by sinking in 30% sucrose in PBS overnight at 4°C. They were
embedded in OCT compound, frozen, and stored at �80°C. Orga-
noids were sectioned to 20-lm cryosections. All solutions up to
probe hybridization were RNase free. Slides were post-fixed for
15 min in 4% PFA at RT, washed in PBS, bleached for 15 min in
3% H2O2-PBS at RT, washed with PBS, and treated for 5 min at RT
with 40 lg/ml proteinase K. The slides were directly fixed with 4%
PFA for 15 min, washed in PBS, and incubated for 10 min in fresh
acetylation
solution
(250 ml
H2O,
2.235 ml
triethanolamine,
0.437 ml HCl, 0.938 ml acetic anhydride). Slides were pre-hybri-

formamide, 5 ml salmon sperm DNA, 10 ml 50× Denhart’s solution,
205 ml H2O, 5 ml 0.5 M EDTA) at 65°C for 3 h in a slide mailer and
incubated overnight with in situ probe 1:400 (denatured for 10 min
at 70°C and quickly cooled on ice) in hybridization buffer at 65°C.
