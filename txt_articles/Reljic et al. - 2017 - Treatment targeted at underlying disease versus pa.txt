ABSTRACT
Objective: To assess the efficacy of active treatment
targeted at underlying disease (TTD)/potentially
curative treatments versus palliative care (PC) in
improving overall survival (OS) in terminally ill patients.
Design: We performed a systematic review and meta-
analysis of randomised controlled trials (RCT).
Methodological quality of included RCTs was assessed
using the Cochrane risk of bias tool.
Data sources: Medline and Cochrane databases were
searched, with no language restriction, from inception
to 19 October 2016.
Eligibility criteria for selecting studies: Any RCT
assessing the efficacy of any active TTD versus PC in
adult patients with terminal illness with a prognosis of
<6-month survival were eligible for inclusion.
Results: Initial search identified 8252 citations of
which 10 RCTs (15 comparisons, 1549 patients) met
inclusion criteria. All RCTs included patients with
cancer. OS was reported in 7 RCTs (8 comparisons,
1158 patients). The pooled results showed no
statistically significant difference in OS between TTD
and PC (HR (95% CI) 0.85 (0.71 to 1.02)). The
heterogeneity between pooled studies was high
(I2=62.1%). Overall rates of adverse events were higher
in the TTD arm.
Conclusions: Our systematic review of available RCTs
in patients with terminal illness due to cancer shows
that TTD compared with PC did not demonstrably
impact OS and is associated with increased toxicity.
The results provide assurance to physicians, patients
and family that the patients’ survival will not be
compromised by referral to hospice with focus on PC.
INTRODUCTION
The
diagnosis
of
a
terminal
illness
for
patients is shattering news.1 Following the
diagnosis, patients along with their families
are faced with several complex decisions
relating to medical, spiritual, legal, or exist-
ential issues.1 The most concerning decision
for patients and families alike following diag-
nosis of terminal illness relates to the choice
of medical strategy of either opting for active
treatment
targeted
at
underlying
disease
(TTD)
which
can
potentially
be
life-
prolonging or curative, versus palliative care
(PC) where the primary focus is on provid-
ing symptomatic relief and improving quality
of life (QOL).2 The US Medicare regulations
recommend PC for patients with terminal
illness,
ideally
in hospice
setting,
if the
expected survival is <6 months; conversely,
PC or referral to hospice
is considered
inappropriate
if
expected
survival
is
<6 months. However, findings from several
studies show that application of these recom-
mendations is far from optimal in real-life
setting. For example, around 40% of patients
with advanced lung cancer continued aggres-
sive therapy through the final month of life.3
Overall, over 60% of patients with cancer
receive
aggressive
TTD
within
the
past
3 months of life.4–7 In fact, during the last
decade, the number of patients receiving
aggressive therapy within the last month of
life grew8 which also reflects the increased
healthcare spending in the past 6 months of
life. On the other hand, use of hospice in
the past 3 days of life minimally increased
from 14.3% to 17%.2 9 10 In short, patients
Strengths and limitations of this study
▪ This is the first systematic review of randomised
controlled trials to assess the benefits and risks
associated with active treatment targeted at
underlying
disease
versus
palliative
in
the
end-of-life setting.
▪ One of the strengths of this study was the exten-
sive, systematic literature search performed to
identify all available randomised controlled trials
in terminally ill patients.
▪ A limitation of this systematic review is the avail-
ability of small number of studies with overall
survival data.

 with terminal illness are not receiving care as per the
professional societies’ or Medicare recommendations.2
There are several reasons for not delivering the appropri-
ate care to patients with terminal illness. One of the main
reasons is lack of evidence or conflicting evidence related to
benefits and harms associated with TTD versus PC.2
Findings from a randomised controlled trial (RCT) assessing
the role of supportive care versus supportive care in addition
to TTD in patients with transitional cell carcinoma of urothe-
lial tract demonstrated no survival advantage with a combin-
ation treatment approach.11 Another study by Schmid et al12
which assessed the role of radiotherapy or chemotherapy
(ie, TTD) compared with no treatment in patients with inop-
erable squamous carcinoma of the oesophagus showed no
survival advantage with TTD. However, results from a RCT
comparing supportive care versus supportive care plus TTD
in patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer
showed a survival advantage with TTD.13
Given that physicians are not accurate in establishing
patients’ prognosis for course of disease or death,14 15 to
make informed choice, patients and physicians alike
need reliable evidence on benefits and risks associated
with TTD versus PC. Accordingly, we performed a sys-
tematic review with a goal to synthesise all available evi-
dence to reliably assess the efficacy and safety of TTD
compared with PC in patients with terminal illness (with
expected survival of <6 months).
METHODS
This systematic review was performed according to a pre-
specified protocol and is reported according to PRISMA
guidelines.16
Eligibility criteria
Any RCT enrolling patients with clearly stated predicted
median survival of <6 months comparing an established
TTD versus PC alone was eligible for inclusion. Studies
of novel TTD treatments within a context of clinical
trials were excluded. We also excluded trials comparing
add-on PC to two active treatments. The distinction
between PC versus TTD was made based on the original
investigators intent (ie, symptom management vs cura-
tive or life prolonging intent) as stated in the introduc-
tion or methods of included studies.
Search and study selection
A comprehensive search of Medline and Cochrane elec-
tronic databases, with no language restriction, was under-
taken from inception to 19 October 2016. Search strategy
is provided in online supplementary appendix 1. Two
authors (AK and TR) reviewed all retrieved titles/abstracts
and full-text articles independently. A third author (BD)
reviewed any disagreements to arrive at consensus.
Data collection
Data were abstracted on study and patient characteristics,
treatment, and outcomes (overall survival (OS), QOL,
treatment-related mortality (TRM), and adverse events).
Data extraction was performed independently by two
authors (TR and FAK) using a standardised data extrac-
tion form. The corresponding author (BD) resolved any
disagreement during the data extraction process. Risk of
bias was assessed using Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool.17
The overall assessment of methodological quality was
performed
using
Grading
of
Recommendations
Assessment,
Development
and
Evaluation
(GRADE)
methodology.18
Statistical analysis
When appropriate, data were pooled for each outcome.
Dichotomous data were summarised using risk ratio
(RR) based on the number of events and total number
of participants and pooled under random-effects model.
In regards to time-to-event data, HR and 95% CIs were
extracted, whenever reported. Otherwise, total number
of participants and events per arm and the p value were
obtained in order to calculate the observed minus
expected value (O-E) and variance as per method by
Tierney et al.19 Time-to-event data were pooled using
generic inverse variance under the random-effects model.
All data are reported with 95% CI. Calculation of the I2
statistic was used to assess for heterogeneity. An I2 <30%
was considered low heterogeneity, between 30% and 50%
moderate heterogeneity and over 50% high heterogen-
eity.20

RESULTS
Study selection
The initial search identified 8252 articles of which 10
RCTs (15 comparisons, 1549 patients) met the inclusion
criteria.11–13
21–27 The study selection process is illu-
strated in figure 1.
Characteristics of included studies
As illustrated in table 1, all included studies enrolled
patients with cancer. The majority of studies compared
disease-targeted chemotherapy (12/15 comparisons) to
PC alone11–13 21–26 while the remaining three studies
used
targeted
drug
therapy,27
radiotherapy,12
and
hormone therapy26 on the TTD arm. The PC arm
mainly
consisted
of

Risk of bias in included studies
The overall methodological quality of included studies
ranged from moderate to low. As shown in figure 2, 80%
of included studies (8/10) reported method of random-
isation sequence generation. However, only 20% (2/10)
of included studies were judged to have adequate

blinding of participants/personnel or outcome assessors.
Ninety per cent of studies (9/10) performed analysis as
per intention-to-treat principle and 70% (7/10) studies
reported all outcomes and did not involve selective
reporting of outcomes.
Outcomes
Patient outcomes are summarised in table 2. Figure 3
shows a forest plot comparing effects of TTD versus PC
on the OS. OS was reported by seven RCTs (eight com-
parisons, 1158 patients).11–13 23–25 27 The pooled results
showed
no
statistically significant
difference
in
OS
between TTD and PC (HR (95% CI) 0.85 (0.71 to
1.02)). The heterogeneity between pooled studies was
high (I2=62.1%). Four studies included QOL as an
outcome;
however,
data
were
not
extractable
for
pooling.11
23
24
27 Only
two
RCTs (668 patients)
reported TRM.11 25 There was no statistically significant
difference in TRM between TTD and PC (RR (95% CI)
0.92
(0.31
to
2.76)).
There was
no
heterogeneity
between pooled studies (I2=0%). Seven RCTs (10 com-
parisons)11
13
22–26 discussed adverse events but only
three (three comparisons)11 23 25 reported comparative
data for both study arms. Overall, grade three or four
adverse events were significantly more common on the
TTD arm compared with PC (see table 2).
DISCUSSION
The findings of this systematic review have several
important implications for physicians, patients and pol-
icymakers. Physicians are obligated legally and ethically
to provide patients with evidence on alternative manage-
ment options in the end-of-life setting. Some states such
as New York and California make the failure to discuss
the management alternatives in terminal setting punish-
able by law (up to $5000 for repeated offences, and
wilful violations by a jail term of up to 1 year).28
However, repeated assessments of the quality of decision-
making in the end-of-life setting over the last two
decades continue to show that is inadequate.1 In 2014,
55 million people died worldwide, the vast majority of
whom did not receive adequate end-of-life care.29 The
fundamental reason for this state of affairs is the lack of
reliable estimates about the efficacy and safety of active
treatment (TTD) versus PC in patients in terminal
phase of their lives. Even though it is known that PC
does improve survival when it is added to TTD,30 it is
not known if TTD is superior to PC alone. Our system-
atic review fills this void. To the best of our knowledge,

 this is the first systematic review assessing the role of
TTD compared with PC in patients with terminal illness
with
expected
survival
of
<6 months.
The
findings
showed that overall TTD compared with PC does not
improve survival and is associated with significantly
higher incidence of fatigue, nausea/vomiting, mucositis,
grade III/IV neuropathy, anaemia, leukopenia, neutro-
paenia, and myalgia leading to poor QOL.
Decisions to discontinue with TTD and focus on PC
are accompanied by an assessment that such treatments
would be ineffective, potentially harmful or medically
futile.2 Therefore, for patients and physicians our system-
atic review provides a long-awaited empirical answer on
benefits and harms associated with TTD compared with
PC. Based on research synthesis of all available rando-
mised evidence, we found that patients with terminal
illness and their physicians can avoid the impulse to ‘try
anything or everything’ in desire to potentially prolong
survival due to uncertainty if TTD is superior to PC. We
demonstrated that this is not the case, and, in fact, TTD
is typically more toxic. Our results, therefore, can be
used to facilitate shared decision-making in end of life
care setting, which is often difficult for physicians,
patients and families. Our results may assist patients and
physicians when making a decision on whether to con-
tinue or discontinue TTD and make an informed choice
between TTD versus PC. Given that unrealistic patient
and physician expectations are key barriers to improving
the quality of end-of-life care,31 providing reliable evi-
dence to ‘serve as a neutral arbiter’,32 our results may
help assure patients, physicians and family members that
focus on PC and hospice referral may not compromise
the patient life expectancy but, in fact, result in higher
quality of end-of-life care. If acted on, our findings may
help improve referral to hospice; as stated above, over
16% of patients with cancer who die in hospice care are
in hospice for <3 days while many do not receive
hospice care at all.33 34 Similarly, our results may minim-
ise unnecessary suffering as many patients with a ter-
minal prognosis receive chemotherapy in the last month
of life.35 Therefore, the findings from our systematic
review may inform the referral to hospice for patients
with terminal illness and avoid the late referrals to
hospice; early referrals to hospice can help patients
enjoy the full benefits of hospice care, more fulfilling
remaining days of their lives while avoiding toxicity of
unnecessary treatment. For policymakers, the evidence
from this systematic review should promote a discussion
on reimbursement practices where providers are more
likely to be reimbursed for shared conversations with
patients instead of administering aggressive therapy.36
Our study has several limitations, mainly due to select-
ive outcome reporting and methodological quality of
the
primary
studies
eligible
for
this
analysis.
For
example, of the 10 RCTs that met the inclusion criteria
only 7 (eight comparisons) reported survival as an
outcome, which is surprising, given that life expectancy
is the most important outcome for patients with ter-
minal illness.37 Additionally, QOL was also measured
and reported in only 4 of the 10 studies; these studies
used
different
QOL
measures
making
comparisons
more difficult. However, despite selective reporting in
individual studies, these findings represent the totality of
the currently available evidence. The overall methodo-
logical quality of included studies ranged from moderate
to low, which can be attributed to lack of allocation con-
cealment and blinding. Whether, the lack of allocation
concealment is an artefact of reporting or conduct38
could not be determined since study protocols were not
available. Regarding the lack of blinding, we believe this
issue is not a major concern because survival was the
main outcome for our study; mortality is an objective
outcome and blinding is important in cases where the
outcome is subjective.
In summary, our systematic review of available RCTs in
patients with terminal illness shows that TTD compared
with PC does not impact survival and is associated with
increased toxicity. The results provide assurance to physi-
cians, patients, and family that the patients with esti-
mated survival of <6 months would be better off by

 referral to hospice. Whether new drugs with potentially
life prolonging potential and safer toxicity profile will
challenge these findings can only be determined in
future well designed RCTs with adequate power. The
average sample size in included studies was 124, which
provides 15% power to detect a 15% survival difference
(HR of 0.85 observed in this meta-analysis). To detect a
15% survival difference with 80% power and a 0.05 level
of significance, a sample size of 1194 patients is needed.
In the mean time, the physicians should be judicious in
actively treating patients whose estimated survival is
<6 months and provide information on benefits and
risks associated with TTD versus PC to facilitate shared
decision-making.

Figure 3
Forest plot for overall survival. The summary estimate (HR) from individual studies is indicated by rectangles with lines
representing the 95% CIs. The summary pooled estimate from all studies is represented by the diamond and the stretch of the
diamond indicates the corresponding 95% CI. Summary estimates that fall to the left of the line (HR<1) indicate favourable
survival on the treatment targeted at underlying disease (TTD) arm. Summary estimates that fall to the right of the line (HR>1)
indicate favourable survival on the palliative care (PC) arm.
