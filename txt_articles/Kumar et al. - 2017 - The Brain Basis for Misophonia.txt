SUMMARY
Misophonia is an affective sound-processing disor-
der characterized by the experience of strong nega-
tive emotions (anger and anxiety) in response to
everyday sounds, such as those generated by other
people eating, drinking, chewing, and breathing
[1–8]. The commonplace nature of these sounds
(often referred to as ‘‘trigger sounds’’) makes miso-
phonia a devastating disorder for sufferers and their
families, and yet nothing is known about the under-
lying mechanism. Using functional and structural
MRI coupled with physiological measurements, we
demonstrate that misophonic subjects show specific
trigger-sound-related responses in brain and body.
Specifically, fMRI showed that in misophonic sub-
jects,
trigger
sounds
elicit greatly
exaggerated
blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) responses
in the anterior insular cortex (AIC), a core hub of
the ‘‘salience network’’ that is critical for perception
of interoceptive signals and emotion processing.
Trigger sounds in misophonics were associated
with
abnormal
functional
connectivity
between
AIC and a network of regions responsible for the
processing and regulation of emotions, including
ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), posterome-
dial cortex (PMC), hippocampus, and amygdala.
Trigger sounds elicited heightened heart rate (HR)
and galvanic skin response (GSR) in misophonic sub-
jects, which were mediated by AIC activity. Question-
naire analysis showed that misophonic subjects
perceived their bodies differently: they scored higher
on interoceptive sensibility than controls, consistent
with abnormal functioning of AIC. Finally, brain struc-
tural measurements implied greater myelination
within vmPFC in misophonic individuals. Overall,
our results show that misophonia is a disorder in
which abnormal salience is attributed to particular
sounds based on the abnormal activation and func-
tional connectivity of AIC.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
fMRI data were acquired in 20 misophonic and 22 age- and sex-
matched controls while they listened to a set of three sounds:
trigger sounds (which evoke a misophonic reaction in miso-
phonic individuals; e.g., eating, breathing sounds), unpleasant
sounds (which are perceived to be annoying by both groups
but do not evoke misophonic distress; e.g., baby cry, a person
screaming), and neutral sounds (e.g., rain). After listening to
each sound, subjects rated (1) how annoying the sound was
(both groups) and (2) how effectively the sound triggered a
typical misophonic reaction (misophonic group only) or how anti-
social (in the sense the subject would not like to be in the environ-
ment in which the sound is produced) the sounds were (control
group only). Behavioral responses, galvanic skin response
(GSR) and heart rate (HR), were acquired during the acquisition
of fMRI data (see Figure 1A for a schematic of the paradigm).
Whole-brain structural MRI data were acquired as multi-param-
eter maps (MPMs) [9] to measure myelination content, water,
and iron levels.
Behavioral data (Figure 1B) showed that trigger sounds
evoked misophonic distress in misophonic subjects, whereas
the unpleasant sounds, although annoying, did not produce a
misophonic reaction. There was no difference between the miso-
phonic distress ratings of trigger sounds by the misophonic
group and annoyance ratings of unpleasant sounds by the con-
trol group. It is likely, however, that the two groups used different
subjective scales while rating the sounds. Random-effects anal-
ysis of fMRI data using the general linear model (GLM) [10] with
group (two levels) and sound types (three categories) as factors
demonstrated an interaction in the anterior insular cortex (AIC)
bilaterally (Figure 2A; further regions are listed in Table S1).
Further analysis showed that the interaction in AIC was driven
by greater activation in misophonic subjects compared to con-
trol subjects in response to trigger sounds (see Figure 2B and
Figure S1 for confirmatory plots; see also Figure S2). Significant
activation differences between misophonic and control subjects
did not occur to unpleasant or neutral sounds. Activity in both the
left and right AIC varied linearly with the subjective rating of
misophonic distress in the misophonic group, as shown in confir-
matory plots in Figure 2C. A large body of evidence [11] impli-
cates AIC in subjective feelings associated with emotions,
including anger. Functionally, AIC is known to be a key node of

 the salience network [12], an intrinsic large-scale brain network
for detecting and orienting attention toward stimuli that are
behaviorally relevant and meaningful for an individual. Specific
hyperactivity in AIC to trigger sounds supports the hypothesis
that misophonic subjects assign aberrantly higher salience to
these sounds.
Having identified AIC as a key region that differentiates trigger
sounds in misophonic participants, we sought to explore its
stimulus-dependent connectivity profile to establish whether
there are alterations at the network level that are specific to
misophonia. Using left AIC as a seed region, we analyzed its
stimulus-dependent connectivity in the two groups. Greater
functional connectivity of AIC for misophonic subjects was
observed in a network of brain regions comprising the ventrome-
dial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), posteromedial cortex (PMC; pos-
terior cingulate and retrosplenial cortex), hippocampus, and
amygdala (Figure 3A). This increased functional connectivity
was specific to trigger sounds: no significant differences in con-
nectivity were observed for unpleasant sounds. Importantly, the
functional connectivity pattern between the two groups for the
same sounds was not only different quantitatively but also qual-
itatively: whereas the connectivity to vmPFC is positive (with
respect to connectivity for neutral sounds) in misophonic sub-
jects, the connectivity for controls for the same set of sounds
is negative. Analysis of functional connectivity of right AIC also
showed trigger-sound-specific increased connectivity to vmPFC
and PMC (Figure S3A; functional connectivity to amygdala and
hippocampus was also observed but at a slightly relaxed
threshold). The vmPFC and PMC together form core parts of
the default mode network (DMN) [13] (see Figure S3B for overlap
between the DMN and the functional connectivity network of
AIC), which is activated when subjects are engaged in internally
directed thoughts and retrieval of memories [14] and is deacti-
vated when attention is directed to external stimuli. Greater
coupling of AIC with the DMN suggests that misophonic sub-
jects, on hearing trigger sounds, are unable to ‘‘disengage’’
AIC from the DMN, which entails memories and contextual asso-
ciations of trigger sounds to bear on the activation of AIC. This is
also consistent with a recent study [15] using multivariate pattern
classification, which showed that patterns of activity in vmPFC
and PMC were most informative in distinguishing different types
of emotions. Distinct functional connectivity of AIC to vmPFC
and PMC in misophonics and controls for the same sounds sug-
gests that these regions play a crucial role in instantiating
different emotional responses for the trigger sounds in the two
groups. This atypical functional connectivity could, therefore,
underlie the abnormal activation of AIC and the aberrant salience
assigned to trigger sounds by the misophonic group.
Because misophonia symptoms start early in life (mean age of
onset is �12 years and can be as early as 5 years [1]), we also
Figure 1. Experimental Paradigm and Subjective Ratings
(A) fMRI paradigm: a standard block design was used in which sounds were presented for 15 s. After every sound, subjects gave two ratings on a scale from 1 to 4
with a button press for (1) how annoying the sound was and (2) how effective the sound was in triggering misophonic reaction (misophonia group) or how antisocial
the sound was (control group). fMRI data were acquired continuously with a repetition time (TR) of 3.12 s. GSR and HR were also monitored throughout the
experiment.
(B) Subjective ratings: (i) misophonic distress rating of three types of sounds by misophonic group; (ii) antisocialness rating of sounds (control subjects); and (iii)
annoyance rating of sounds by both groups. Misophonic subjects rated the trigger sounds as evoking greater misophonic reaction compared to unpleasant (p <
0.001) and neutral sounds (p < 0.001). Unpleasant sounds were still perceived to be annoying (p < 0.001 compared to neutral sounds) by the misophonic subjects,
demonstrating a dissociation between general annoyance and misophonic reaction. See also Figure S4 for subjective scores on body perception. Data are
represented as mean (±SEM).

that reflects myelination in brain gray matter. For significance
testing, we limited our search to brain areas that showed higher

Statistical analysis of GSR and HR was performed
time by time using a 2 3 3 ANOVA as in the fMRI
analysis. For the HR time series, interaction be-
tween the factors was significant from 2.4 to 10.4 s
and then from 12.4 to 17 s after sound onset. For
the GSR time series, significant interaction was
observed from 7 to 21.4 s after sound onset (time
points at which GSR and HR are significantly
different are indicated by black horizontal bars
between the panels). Both HR and GSR time se-
ries were cluster thresholded at p < 0.05 with
cluster-forming threshold at p < 0.05. Post hoc
comparison showed that the interaction effect in
both HR and GSR was driven by higher responses
to trigger sounds in misophonic subjects. There
was no difference between the two groups in their
responses to unpleasant and neutral sounds.

functional connectivity to AIC in miso-
phonics compared to controls along
with the seed region. Analysis of struc-
tural maps showed that misophonic sub-
jects have altered MT saturation, which is
consistent with significantly higher myeli-
nation in the gray matter of vmPFC (Figure 3B). This change sug-
gests a possible structural basis for the altered functional con-
nectivity to vmPFC observed in misophonic subjects.
After identification of functional and structural changes in the
brain, we next determined physiological responses of the body

 and their driving sources in the brain. We measured GSR and
HR while subjects listened to three sets of sounds in the MRI
scanner. Trigger sounds evoked greater GSR and HR responses
in misophonic subjects than control subjects (Figure 4A). Physi-
ological responses were sustained throughout the duration of
sound presentation and were specific to trigger sounds, with
no difference in GSR or HR response between the two groups
for unpleasant and neutral sounds. The heightened trigger-spe-
cific autonomic responses we observed are consistent with the
strong tendency of misophonic subjects to escape from the envi-
ronment of trigger sounds [1, 2] or experience strong anxiety and
anger if unable to escape (fight/flight response).
What is the brain source(s) of these heightened autonomic re-
sponses in misophonia? To answer this, we used mediation
analysis [16], which aims to test whether a relation from variable
X (group membership; i.e., misophonic or control) to Y (GSR or
HR) could be explained (mediated) by a third variable, M (brain
activation). A significant mediation implies that there is an indi-
rect path to Y (X to M to Y) and would show brain activity (M)
that can mediate the observed GSR/HR (Y) over and above
what is explained by group membership (X). We ran the whole-
brain mediation analysis separately for GSR and HR. We found
that activity in AIC mediated both the heightened GSR and HR
(Figure 4B) in misophonic subjects.
Over the last decade, there has been a growing recognition
that interoception (perception of internal bodily states) can influ-
ence the salience and experience of emotions associated with a
stimulus [17–20]. Interestingly, AIC is the key brain structure that
integrates ascending visceral inputs from the body with external
sensory inputs. In accordance with this, atypical interoception
and activation in AIC have been shown to underlie a number of
social-emotional disorders [21, 22]. Recently, there has been a
growing interest in extending prediction-based hierarchical
Bayesian inference as a model of interoception [19, 23]. In this
model, interoception involves inferring causes of interoceptive
signals by combining bottom-up interoceptive signals with prior
beliefs (predictions) of their causes. In this multi-level and hierar-
chically organized inference scheme, AIC is at the top of the hi-
erarchy and is suggested to infer the overall state of the body
[24]. Evaluation of subjective beliefs about body perception us-
ing the Body Consciousness Questionnaire [25] showed that mi-
sophonics report greater awareness of internal sensations (Fig-
ure S4) compatible with altered interoceptive sensibility [22] in
misophonics. Given the role of AIC in representing bodily states,
the questionnaire data are also consistent with abnormal AIC
functioning in misophonia.
Conclusions
Overall, our data show that for misophonics, trigger sounds cause
hyperactivity of AIC and an abnormal functional connectivity of
this region with medial frontal, medial parietal, and temporal re-
gions; that there is abnormal myelination in medial frontal cortex
that shows abnormal functional connectivity to AIC; and that the
aberrant neural response mediates the emotional coloring and
physiological arousal that accompany misophonic experiences.
Together, our data suggest that abnormal salience attributed to
otherwise innocuous sounds, coupled with atypical perception
of internal body states, underlies misophonia. With the available
data, it is not possible to decide whether misophonia is a cause
or consequence of atypical interoception, and further work is
needed to delineate the relation between the two.
Misophonia does not feature in any neurological or psychiatric
classification of disorders; sufferers do not report it for fear of the
stigma that this might cause, and clinicians are commonly un-
aware of the disorder. This study defines a clear phenotype
based on changes in behavior, autonomic responses, and brain
activity and structure that will guide ongoing efforts to classify
and treat this pernicious disorder.
