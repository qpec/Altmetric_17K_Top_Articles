Abstract The last decade has seen a dramatic increase in
general interest in and research into vitamin D, with many
athletes now taking vitamin D supplements as part of their
everyday dietary regimen. The most recognized role of
vitamin D is its regulation of calcium homeostasis; there is
a strong relationship between vitamin D and bone health in
non-athletic individuals. In contrast, data have consistently
failed to demonstrate any relationship between serum
25[OH]D and bone health, which may in part be due to the
osteogenic stimulus of exercise. Vitamin D may interact
with extra-skeletal tissues such as muscle and the immune
system to modulate recovery from damaging exercise and
infection risk. Given that many athletes now engage in
supplementation, often consuming extreme doses of vita-
min D, it is important to assess whether excessive vitamin
D can be detrimental to health. It has been argued that toxic
effects only occur when serum 25[OH]D concentrations are
greater than 180 nmol�l-1, but data from our laboratory
have suggested high-dose supplementation could be prob-
lematic. Finally, there is a paradoxical relationship between
serum 25[OH]D concentration, ethnicity, and markers of
bone health: Black athletes often present with low serum
25[OH]D
without
physiological
consequences.
One
explanation for this could be genetic differences in vitamin
D binding protein due to ethnicity, resulting in greater
concentrations of bioavailable (or free) vitamin D in some
ethnic groups. In the absence of any pathology, screening
may be unnecessary and could result in incorrect supple-
mentation. Data must now be re-examined, taking into
consideration bioavailable or ‘‘free’’ vitamin D in ethni-
cally diverse groups to enable new thresholds and target
concentrations to be established; perhaps, for now, it is
time to ‘‘set vitamin D free’’.
1 A Brief Historical Perspective
Vitamin D was first identified in the early twentieth century
by a forerunner of nutritional biochemistry, McCollum [1].
His pioneering work on experimental rickets was the first
to identify the existence of a vitamin that was responsible
for calcium deposition [1], later called vitamin D. Primarily
because of McCollum’s work and the rickets epidemic of
the same era, vitamin D was long recognized only for its
role in bone health. Studies that followed determined the
main source of vitamin D as ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation
exposure and showed that limited quantities could be
obtained from the diet alone. This highlighted that the
vitamin D endocrine system likely developed as an evo-
lutionary adaptation to the sun-rich environments in which
humans evolved.
With advancement of new technologies, our under-
standing of the vitamin D endocrine system and its bio-
logical significance has grown exponentially. Generation of
a vitamin D receptor knockout mouse [2] and high-
throughput gene microarrays have provided a bounty of
newly identified vitamin D targets in numerous tissues such
as bone [3, 4], immune system cells [5], the cardiovascular
system [6], and skeletal muscle [7, 8]. Historically known

 for its canonical role in mediating bone turnover, the val-
idated functions of vitamin D are now understood to be
much further reaching. Many of the newly identified
functions of vitamin D have relevance for athletic perfor-
mance and, as such, vitamin D has found the spotlight in
the world of sports nutrition. Optimizing muscle function
and remodeling, maintaining bone health, and minimizing
infection risk are key examples of how vitamin D may
benefit the athlete. However, vitamin D is clearly not an
ergogenic aid but a biological requirement, and therefore
the use of exogenous vitamin D in any population is a
function of vitamin D status. This message has unfortu-
nately been lost in the search for marginal gains. As we
will uncover, the process of categorizing vitamin D con-
centrations has led to confusion, and new evidence sug-
gests that such guidelines may indeed be based upon the
measurement of the wrong form of vitamin D.
The aim of this review is to provide a current perspec-
tive on the functions of vitamin D that may influence
athletic performance, to clarify current guidelines for
vitamin D intake, and to highlight crucial aspects of future
work that must be tackled. We will address key areas of
common confusion that surround vitamin D in the sports
world, such as defining and measuring vitamin D and what
physiological functions relevant to athletic performers can
be optimized by maintenance of adequate vitamin D status.
2 What is Vitamin D Deficiency?
Exactly what constitutes vitamin D deficiency is subject to
intense debate. Moreover, a lack of understanding of the
key metabolites in the vitamin D pathway can lead to
erroneous recommendations [9]. For this reason, we first
present a collated overview of the US Institute of Medicine
(IoM) guidelines for vitamin D classification [9] and a
simplified schematic of the key vitamin D metabolites and
sites of their production (Fig. 1).
The IoM guidelines refer to concentrations of total
serum 25[OH]D, the sum of 25[OH]D2 and 25[OH]D3,
which are biologically inactive metabolites produced by
hydroxylation of the vitamin D2 and D3 precursors (Fig. 1).
Although the parent sterol vitamin D has a half-life close to
24 h [10], this is relatively short compared with 25[OH]D
with a half-life of 21–30 days [11]. The measurement of
circulating 25[OH]D is a better indicator of vitamin D
exposure, whether obtained from UVB exposure (con-
tributing 80–90% of 25[OH]D) or dietary sources (con-
tributing 10–20%). Measurements of these metabolites are
typically made by extracting serum from a venous blood
sample and eluting the vitamins before analysis via one of
several methods. It is beyond the scope of this review to
critique the analytical techniques for vitamin D metabolite
measurement, but the current gold standard measurement is
liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC–
MS/MS) [12].
It should also be considered that the US IoM reference
intakes might be outdated. Recent commentaries clearly
state that the IoM guidelines were developed based on the
estimated average requirement (EAR) for vitamin D cen-
tered on its role in bone health [13]. Although the same
authors state that extra-skeletal roles of vitamin D remain
under study, a large evidence base of well-controlled trials
suggests the regulation of bone turnover is but one func-
tional role for vitamin D. At present, the most sensible
approach is to avoid severe deficiency and concentrations
considered toxic by the US IoM because the serum con-
centrations necessary to satisfy all biological needs with a
vitamin D requirement is not yet fully understood.
More importantly, as we explore in more detail, the
correlation between 25[OH]D and bone health is grossly
misleading. Although it is unequivocal that vitamin D is
required for calcium deposition and that 25[OH]D has been
the best marker of identifying vitamin D exposure, con-
sideration for what fraction of total 25[OH]D is measured
has been largely overlooked for many years [14]. More-
over, some parameters of health correlate better to other
metabolites of vitamin D [15]. This raises new questions as
to whether measuring 25[OH]D to characterize vitamin D
status is indeed the best practice.
3 Supplemental Vitamin D: The ‘‘On Trend’’
in Sports Nutrition
The misinterpretation of medical guidelines and sugges-
tions of new, non-validated sets of guidelines (such as
those suggested by Heaney and Holick [16] and Zittermann
[17]) have led to blanket supplemental vitamin D plans in
elite sport becoming commonplace. It is reasonable to ask
whether supplementation is necessary for all athletes.
Many studies have assessed 25[OH]D concentrations
across the world in elite and sub-elite athletes throughout
different months of the year [18–28]. Large variations exist
between cohorts of non-supplemented athletes. For exam-
ple, our laboratory has shown large variations between
cohorts of elite rugby players, footballers, and jockeys [29].
Numerous factors, such as dietary differences, sunlight
exposure, clothing, and lifestyle, may all contribute to the
disparities [30]. It is important that athletes at risk of being
deficient are tested before proceeding to correct the vitamin
D inadequacy. It is crucial that applied practitioners and
scientists are aware that whether athletes should be sup-
plemented is purely based on whether they have sufficient
or insufficient/deficient vitamin D concentrations. There is
no ergogenic effect of providing doses of supplemental
S4
D. J. Owens et al.
123
 vitamin D that would elevate 25[OH]D concentrations far
above the cut-off for sufficiency (
[75 nmol�l-1).
When a need to supplement has been identified, an
appropriately screened supplemental form of vitamin D3
should be sourced that can deliver the correct dose. Rec-
ommendations
regarding
supplementation
dose
vary
widely and can often be confusing. From the authors’
combined applied experience, dosing strategies for vitamin
D in elite sport range from 1000 IU/day to blanket sup-
plementation of up to a 100,000 IU bolus per week. This
review should serve to direct practitioners towards a need
for a supplementation decision system that should be
implemented on an individual basis and provide the most
current advice for safe and effective supplementation
protocols.
4 Functional Roles of Vitamin D Relevant
to the Athlete
4.1 Muscle Repair and Remodeling
The purpose of athletic training is to provide a stimulus that
disrupts homeostasis to bring about an adaptive response
that improves competition performance. For athletes,
maximizing the training stimulus is therefore a core prin-
ciple of the training program. Nutrition strategies to
Fig. 1 a Dietary vitamin D3 or exposure of skin to ultraviolet B
(UVB) radiation results in circulating vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol).
This metabolite is hydroxylated in the liver at carbon 25 to form the
metabolite 25[OH]D, a biologically inactive compound with the
longest half-life of the vitamin D metabolites. 25[OH]D circulates
bound to vitamin D-binding protein (VDBP; 85–90%), whereas a
smaller fraction circulates freely in serum (10–15%). 25[OH]D is
transported to the kidney or target tissues expressing 1a-hydroxylase,
where it is hydroxylated further at carbon 1 to form 1a,25[OH]D2D3,
the biologically active vitamin D metabolite. At the target tissue,
1a,25[OH]D2D3 binds to the vitamin D receptor (VDR) and
subsequently forms a heterodimer with retinoid X receptor (RXR),
forming a transcriptional complex that recruits co-activators and
repressors to vitamin D response elements to activate and repress the
gene. b The most common vitamin D metabolites and their sites of

 complement the adaptive response to a physical/metabolic
challenge are intensely researched. Recently, on the basis
of animal trials and in vitro basic biology studies, data have
emerged suggestive of a beneficial role for vitamin D in
skeletal muscle repair and remodeling.
In a randomized controlled trial (RCT), our laboratory
showed that elevating serum 25[OH]D concentrations to
[75 nmol�l-1
with
supplemental
vitamin
D3
at
4000 IU/day has a positive effect on the recovery of force
following a bout of damaging eccentric exercise [31].
Similar
results
were
observed
in
correlative
studies
between serum 25[OH]D and force recovery following
intense exercise [32, 33]. These results imply that adequate
vitamin D exposure can optimize the acute adaptive
response to damaging physical work but do not lend any
support to the idea that vitamin D may be important over
an extended period of training. However, a recent training
study provided evidence to support this idea [34]. The
authors supplemented 40 untrained young and elderly men
with vitamin D3 1920 IU (48 lg) ? 800 mg calcium per
day during December–April (n = 20 per group), or cal-
cium alone (placebo group) at a latitude of 56�N (very little
sunlight exposure). During the final 12 weeks of the sup-
plementation period, participants underwent a resistance
training program for the quadriceps muscles. There were
no observable differences between groups in strength gains
or hypertrophy, but a great fiber type switch (more type IIA
fibers) and a reduction in myostatin messenger RNA
(mRNA) expression were observed in the young men
receiving
vitamin
D.
Interestingly,
the
elderly
men
receiving vitamin D showed an improvement in muscle
quality above that of the placebo group. Taking in vivo
data together, it appears that, where more drastic remod-
eling is required, perhaps with a requirement for satellite
cell recruitment, vitamin D may exert more pronounced
benefits in muscle.
To definitively infer that vitamin D interacts with
muscle to modulate some aspects of muscle remodeling,
molecular mechanisms are essential. More studies have
focused on the molecular actions of vitamin D in muscle
than have focused on translational study designs, so the
challenge to the field remains to decipher the key vitamin
D targets in play during the remodeling process. One study
analyzed global gene expression profiles during mechani-
cal overload-induced skeletal muscle hypertrophy in the
adult mouse [35]. Interestingly, the vitamin D receptor
(VDR)/retinoid X receptor (RXR) nuclear receptor-sig-
naling pathway showed significant upregulation during the
early stages of hypertrophy. Given the known protein
interactions of the VDR (presented graphically in Fig. 2), it
is clear that VDR signaling interacts with pathways asso-
ciated with the maintenance of skeletal muscle mass. In
particular, it may be postulated that VDR signaling is
important for satellite cell activity, consistent with in vivo
observations discussed earlier. Emerging experimental
evidence is in support of this notion. First, the VDR is
expressed in satellite cells and can regulate cell fate deci-
sions (i.e., to differentiate or divide and maintain the stem
cell pool) in satellite cell cultures [36]. Moreover, down-
regulation of the notch pathway, a key regulator of satellite
cell activation [37], has been reported in vitamin D-defi-
cient myogenic cell cultures [38]. We have shown that the
migration and fusion of human-derived skeletal muscle
precursor cells is improved in the presence of 1,25[OH]2D3
[31]. mRNA and protein expression of the VDR appears
higher in satellite cells than in mature muscle fibers, sug-
gesting a more prominent role in muscle progenitors [36].
The signaling axes through which the VDR might
mediate these effects are not well defined. However, the
known and predicted VDR-interacting partners (presented
in
Fig. 2),
such
as
mothers
against
decapentaplegic
homolog 3 (smad3) (implicating the bone morphogenetic
protein (BMP)/transforming growth factor (TGF)-b axis),
Src (Proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase Src)/phos-
phoinositide 3 kinase (PI3K), and cAMP responsible ele-
ment-binding protein (CREB) cascades, are attractive
candidates given their identified roles in muscle progenitor
differentiation and regeneration of muscle following dam-
age [39, 40].
In summary, both large-scale gene expression trials and
focused experimental studies performed in vitro and
in vivo suggest that vitamin D has the capacity to influence
skeletal muscle remodeling, which is of importance to the
athletic performer. Future studies could use publicly
available gene and protein array data to identify candidate
pathways for validation, through which vitamin D may
exert its effects in satellite cells and potentially mature
skeletal muscle fibers.
4.2 Muscle Function
Whether vitamin D has the capacity to have any measur-
able effect on skeletal muscle function in young, trained
athletes is debatable. Available data on this topic are lim-
ited and highly underpowered in young athletic popula-
tions. Moreover, the data that exist are mixed, with some
reporting a positive effect of vitamin D [29, 41] and others
reporting no effect [42, 43]. Many previous reviews discuss
the role of vitamin D in muscle function of the athlete but
discuss data from non-athletic populations. Athletes typi-
cally have minimal margins for improvement because they
are highly trained. Thus, only directly observing effects in
highly trained, athletic populations can give meaningful
results that relate to high performance.
Assertions that vitamin D is important for muscle
function may be due to consistently positive findings in
S6
D. J. Owens et al.
123
 elderly populations. By meta-analysis, it has been reported
that a small number of studies demonstrate an increase in
proximal muscle strength in adults with 25[OH]D con-
centrations \25 nmol�l-1 [44]. It may be that the sar-
copenic status of elderly muscle permits more measurable
benefits to be gleaned from the maintenance of adequate
vitamin D concentration. Another theory is that muscle
function may only be perturbed with severe vitamin D
deficiency, which is more prevalent in the ageing popula-
tion [45].
It may be that vitamin D deficiency negatively impacts
muscle function; however, data coupling cases of severe
deficiency with muscle function in elite athletes do not
exist. Therefore, at present it is not possible to suggest that
vitamin D does play a role in the contractile properties and
force-producing capacity of muscle in athletes. Large-scale
RCTs are needed to address this question, and examination
of athletes at the lowest end of vitamin D deficiency
(
\25 nmol�l-1) is required.
4.3 Innate and Acquired Immunity
Vitamin D has been reported to play important roles in
aspects of both innate and acquired immune function
[46, 47]. As stated previously (Fig. 1), the enzyme 1-alpha
hydroxylase is responsible for the hydroxylation of the
inactive
25[OH]D
to
its
biologically
active
form,
1,25[OH]D. Also, the fact that monocytes, macrophages,
neutrophils, and T and B lymphocytes contain not only the
VDR but also 1-alpha hydroxylase suggests that vitamin D
is functionally important to the immune system.
Activation in immune cells appears to be regulated by
circulating concentrations of 25[OH]D and induced by
activation of the toll-like receptor cascade in the presence
of pathogenic microbiota [48]. In the immune system
specifically, vitamin D upregulates gene expression of
broad-spectrum anti-microbial peptides (AMPs), which are
important regulators in innate immunity [49, 50]. Vitamin
D also exerts an immunomodulatory effect on T and B
lymphocytes in acquired immunity [17, 46]. AMPs,
including cathelicidin, are important proteins in the innate
immune system [51] and help defend against acute illness,
including tuberculosis, influenza, and the common cold
[52–54]. Vitamin D is further suggested to maintain a
balance between the inflammatory type 1 and type 17
T-helper (TH1/TH17) cells and the immunosuppressive
Th2/regulatory T cells (Tregs) to dampen excessive
inflammation and tissue damage [55] and modulate the
acquired immune response. Additional studies suggest that
vitamin D enhances natural killer cell cytolytic activity
[56] and acts to trigger the oxidative burst in activated
macrophages
[57].
A
single
dose
of
vitamin
D3
(100,000 IU) has been shown to enhance the innate
immune response and restrict growth of mycobacteria
in vitro [57].
Variations in vitamin D concentrations have the poten-
tial to measurably influence the immune response. A

 [59], and the general population [60–62] have reported
negative associations between vitamin D concentration and
incidences of upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs). In
one study in college athletes, vitamin D concentrations
over the winter and spring were negatively associated with
documented frequency of acute URTI [63]. The breakpoint
for contracting a single illness appeared to occur at
* 95 nmol�l-1, such that all athletes with circulating
concentrations lower than this breakpoint had one or more
episodes of illness. Those with higher concentrations had
one or fewer episodes. A similar study in endurance ath-
letes reported that a greater proportion of athletes main-
taining circulating 25[OH]D concentration \30 nmol�l-1
presented with URTI symptoms, with the fewest symptoms
reported
in
those
with
25(OH)D
concentrations
[120 nmol�l-1 [64]. Athletes with low vitamin D con-
centrations also had higher URTI symptom days and higher
symptom-severity scores. However, randomly assigned
placebo-controlled studies are needed in athletic popula-
tions to confirm the effectiveness of correcting low vitamin
D concentrations on aspects of immune health and the
prevention of URTIs. One recent RCT in university ath-
letes found evidence that 14-week supplementation with
vitamin D3 5000 IU per day during winter training sig-
nificantly increased salivary secretion rates of cathelicidin
and secretory immunoglobulin A compared with a placebo
control, which could improve resistance to respiratory
infections [65].
4.4 Cardiac Structure and Function
The heart and vascular system, like skeletal muscle, con-
tain the VDR and the apparatus for 1,25[OH]2D3 produc-
tion
[66,
67].
An
association
between
vitamin
D
concentration
and
cardiovascular
function
was
first
observed 30 years ago in Sprague–Dawley rats; histologi-
cal analysis of vitamin D-deficient rats showed signifi-
cantly smaller ventricular myofibrils and increases in
extracellular
matrix
proteins
compared
with
vitamin
D-sufficient rats [67]. Subsequent research has established
that vitamin D deficiency may adversely affect cardiac
contractility, vascular tone, cardiac collagen content, and
cardiac tissue maturation [68].
Human trials have produced some evidence that vitamin
D deficiency may be related to an increased risk of car-
diometabolic outcomes. The Framingham Offspring Study
found an association between lower serum 25[OH]D con-
centrations and increased risk of cardiovascular events
[50]. There was a graded increase in cardiovascular risk
across pre-specified thresholds of 25[OH]D deficiency,
with multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios of 1.53 (95%
confidence interval (CI) 1.00–2.36) for levels 25 to
\37 nmol�l-1 and 1.80 (95% CI 1.05–3.08) for levels
\25 nmol�l-1. However, this relationship was found only
among participants who were hypertensive at baseline [50].
Data from the HPFS (Health Professionals Follow-up
Study) found a significant correlation between lower serum
25[OH]D concentration (defined as \37 nmol�l-1) and
elevated risk of myocardial infarction [69]. Scragg et al.
[70] also showed an inverse relationship between 25[OH]D
and incidence of myocardial infarction in the general
population, although this association may have been
intermediated by physical activity. In both the Tromso and
Hoorn studies [71, 72], serum 25[OH]D was not associated
with left ventricular (LV) structure and function, whereas
later research reported that serum concentrations of
25[OH]D are significantly associated with LV diastolic
dysfunction [73]. The relationship between vitamin D and
cardiac function in the general population therefore
remains controversial, with research generating equivocal
evidence. The heterogeneity of research findings may be a
consequence of differing definitions of vitamin D status,
age of sample population, definition and determination of
cardiovascular endpoints, and other confounding factors.
Professional athletes are unique amongst the general
population, as they regularly participate in prolonged and
intensive physical exercise that is associated with several
structural and electrophysiological cardiac adaptations
[74]. These adaptations enhance diastolic filling and
facilitate a sustained increase in cardiac output, which is
fundamental to athletic performance. Such cardiac adap-
tations are collectively referred to as the ‘‘athlete’s heart’’.
Numerous factors affect the adaptations of the athlete’s
heart, including sporting modality, duration and intensity,
age, ethnicity, sex, anthropometry, and performance-en-
hancing substance abuse (Fig. 3). Despite some evidence
of a relationship between vitamin D and cardiac function,
few studies have examined the association between
25[OH]D concentration and cardiac structure and function
in healthy athletes, a population repeatedly reported to be
vitamin D deficient [22, 29, 75]. Our group recently
observed that the aortic root and left atria diameters,
intraventricular septum diameter, LV diameter during
diastole, LV mass, LV volume during diastole, and right
atrial area of severely 25[OH]D-deficient (defined as
\25 nmol�l-1) athletes were significantly smaller than
those of insufficient and sufficient athletes [76].
The precise mechanisms causing this lack of cardiac
hypertrophy in the 25[OH]D-deficient state remain unclear.
However, what is understood, is that the remodeling
mechanisms associated with cardiac disease and chronic
overloading (such as long-standing mitral insufficiency,
essential hypertension, chronic heart failure, kidney dis-
ease, and dilated cardiomyopathy) differ considerably from
the physiological adaptations seen in athletes induced
through prolonged and intensive exercise.

 Studies in rodent models show that the VDR and 1a-
hydroxylase mediate arterial hardening and endothelial
function. Also, the endothelial dysfunction observed in
VDR-knockout mice is caused by a reduction in nitric
oxide bioavailability [77]. Furthermore, vitamin D induces
a counter-regulatory process in the renin-angiotensin-al-
dosterone system by diminishing its proliferating effects on
the vascular smooth muscle cells [78]. There may also be
vitamin
D-dependent
cardio-protective
mechanisms,
including reducing vessel wall damage caused by inflam-
mation through increased expression of anti-inflammatory
cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-10, and decreasing
expression of pro-inflammatory molecules, e.g., tumor
necrosis factor (TNF)-a and IL-6 [79].
The relationship between vitamin D and cardiac func-
tion remains highly controversial. Despite the growing
body of evidence demonstrating a link between vitamin D
deficiency and cardiovascular risk factors, very few studies
have examined the association between vitamin D status
and cardiac structure and function in healthy athletes.
Future research should look to identify the precise mech-
anisms causing cardiac hypertrophy with increases in
vitamin D status in healthy athletes.
4.5 Bone Health and Fracture Risk
Vitamin D status is indicative of calcium absorption and
bone mineralization [80], and a considerable expanse of
knowledge describes the relationship between vitamin D
deficiency
and
bone
health
[80–87].
Genetic,
environmental,
and
cultural
factors
associated
with
25[OH]D deficiency [88] increase the risk of osteoporosis
[89] and are a major contributor to fracture risk [90].
However, observational studies fail to universally affirm a
proportionate susceptibility to bone loss, osteoporotic
fractures, or rickets [91, 92], particularly in athletes, a
population in which stress fractures are frequently observed
[93].
Bone is a metabolically active tissue capable of adapting
to mechanical stimuli and repairing structural damage [94].
Bone remodeling is a dynamic physiological process that
consists of three main consecutive processes: (1) resorp-
tion, when osteoclasts digest old bone; (2) reversal, when
mononuclear cells appear on the bone surface; and (3)
formation, when osteoblasts lay down new bone until the
resorbed bone is completely replaced [95–97]. The regu-
lation of osteoblast function is of greatest relevance to
understanding how vitamin D functions in bone. Vitamin D
impacts on osteoblast/osteocyte regulation in the process of
bone remodeling, and osteoblasts respond to a variety of
resorptive signals, including 1,25[OH]2D3 and parathyroid
hormone
(PTH).
The
active
form
of
vitamin
D,
1,25[OH]2D3 affects osteoblast function via different
mechanisms. It controls remodeling via induction of
receptor
activator
of
nuclear
factor
(NF)-jB
ligand
(RANKL)
[98],
regulates
phosphate
homeostasis
by
increasing fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) [99], and
may enhance the response of mechanical loads via stimu-
lation of mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling [100].

 1,25[OH]2D3 from the 25[OH]D3 precursor and that this
activity is likely to account for the skeletal effects of cir-
culating 25[OH]D3 [101].
Athletes undertake mechanical loading from training or
competition that is associated with an increase in bone
mineral density (BMD) [102, 103]. Any training-induced
increase in body mass contributes to the process of bone
remodeling and forms mechanically appropriate bone
structure [104]. The stimulus of loading the muscu-
loskeletal system through high-intensity dynamic sporting
activity is proposed to compensate for 25[OH]D defi-
ciency, with the absence of poor bone health in athletes
[102, 105]. However, non-weight-bearing athletes are
prone to the same detrimental skeletal effects [104, 106]
and are at higher risk for low BMD when vitamin D status
is low [107–109].
Recent research shows no association between serum
25[OH]D concentration and measures of bone health in an
ethnically diverse athletic population,
irrespective
of
exercise type (weight/non-weight bearing) [110]. This
draws into question the use of 25[OH]D concentration as a
measure for predicting bone health in the athletic popula-
tion. Genetic polymorphism in the 25[OH]D/1,25[OH]2D
pathway may potentially account for some of these dif-
ferences [22, 111]. This notion is supported by recent
research that demonstrated racial differences in manifes-
tations for vitamin D and markers of bone health
[112, 113]. Further detail on this phenomenon is described
in Sect. 5 of this review.
Optimum concentrations of serum 25[OH]D for the best
possible skeletal health are still debated. Many investiga-
tors define the threshold for vitamin D sufficiency as the
lowest serum 25[OH]D concentration that maximally
suppresses
PTH
secretion
and/or
optimizes
BMD
[114–116]. Observational studies have shown inconsistent
associations between BMD and serum 25[OH]D status
[117, 118], particularly in racial minorities and athletic
populations [113, 119, 120]. Further work, including con-
trolled genetic studies, is needed to discriminate between
direct actions of 1,25[OH]2D3 on osteoblasts.
5 Vitamin D-Binding Protein (VDBP),
Polymorphisms, and the Black Athlete Paradox
There appears to be a paradoxical relationship between
ethnicity and vitamin D concentration that has largely been
ignored. When examining 25[OH]D deficiency in ethni-
cally diverse populations, studies demonstrate that Black
and Hispanic men are at elevated risk of 25[OH]D defi-
ciency but at lower risk of osteoporosis, rapid bone loss,
and associated fractures [112, 113] than Caucasians [121].
In Caucasians, BMD significantly decreases as serum
25[OH]D declines, but this is not observed in Black adults
[84].
Vitamin D-binding protein (VDBP) provides insight into
why certain ethnic groups may have distinct 25[OH]D and
BMD relationships [122]. VDBP is a 51–58 kDa multi-
functional and highly polymorphic glycoprotein synthesized
primarily by the hepatic parenchymal cells. Originally
known as the group-specific component (Gc-globulin),
VDBP is a member of a multigene family that includes
albumin (Alb) and is a monomeric peptide of 458 residues
and three disulphide-bonded, structural domains [123]. Two
binding regions have been localized: (1) vitamin D-binding
domain, located between residues 35–49 at the N-terminal
and (2) actin-binding domain, positioned between residues
350–403 at the C-terminal. These are necessary to mediate
VDBP cellular functions [124] (Fig. 4).
VDBP is the primary vitamin D carrier, binding 85–90%
of circulating 25[OH]D and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3
[1,25[OH]2D3], the biologically active form of vitamin D,
and
the remaining unbound
25[OH]D is considered
bioavailable (either free or bound to albumin). About
10–15% of total 25[OH]D is bound to albumin, in contrast
to free 25[OH]D, which accounts for \1% of total circu-
lating vitamin D [125]. Since the affinity of albumin to
25[OH]D or 1,25[OH]2D3 is weaker than that of VDBP, the
loosely bound fraction and the free fraction comprise
bioavailable 25[OH]D [126].
Genotyping has identified two common single-nu-
cleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the coding region of the
VDBP gene (rs4588 and rs7041) [127]. Combinations of
these two SNPs produce three major polymorphic forms of
VDBP (Gc1F, Gc1S, and Gc2), which differ substantially
in their binding affinity for 25[OH]D, circulating concen-
tration, and variation between ethnic groups [128] and are
in turn linked to VDBP function. These variants change the
amino acid sequence, alter the protein function, and are
common enough to generate population-wide constitutive
differences in vitamin D status [50, 127]. Therefore, racial
differences in manifestations of vitamin D deficiency may
indeed be related to genetic variation in VDBP [128].
However, to date, research on vitamin D status in athletes
has overlooked these common allelic variations in VDBP.
These findings also question the relative importance of
measuring total 25[OH]D vs. the unbound bioavailable
fraction of 25[OH]D (discussed in detail in Sect. 7).
6 Too Much of a Good Thing
Figure 1 highlights that serum 25[OH]D levels that are too
high (
[180 nmol�l-1) may be toxic, according to the US
IoM. Case reports of vitamin D toxicity are limited, but,
nevertheless, there is a risk of toxicity when supplementing
S10
D. J. Owens et al.
123
 with exogenous vitamin D. Despite the search for ‘‘opti-
mal’’ serum 25[OH]D concentrations, very few studies
have examined whether high concentrations of 25[OH]D
that do not result in toxicity are actually beneficial. Our
group recently began to address this question by examining
the effects of high-dose vitamin D3 supplementation
(35,000 IU vs. 70,000 IU weekly) on all major vitamin D
metabolites (25[OH]D, 1,25[OH]2D3, 24[25[OH]D, and
PTH) in a cohort of elite athletes [129]. Our findings
suggested
that
both
doses
effectively
raised
serum
25[OH]D and 1,25[OH]2D3; however, the highest dose
(70,000 IU/week) also raised the product of vitamin D
catabolism, 24,25[OH]D. This metabolite is thought to
exert a negative effect on 1,25[OH]2D3 signaling and may
inhibit the conversion of 25[OH]D to 1,25[OH]2D3 in a
negative feedback loop. Interestingly, when athletes were
withdrawn
from
supplementation,
the
24,25[OH]D
metabolite remained elevated even though 25[OH]D and
1,25[OH]2D3 fell. One could speculate that persistent ele-
vation of 24,25[OH]D in the face of declining active
1,25[OH]2D3 could result in the opposite effect than what
was intended. Recent evidence supporting the examination
of all vitamin D metabolites has emerged. Pleiotropic
effects of the vitamin D metabolome were observed in a
study of vitamin D status and muscle function and gene
expression in the elderly, suggesting that future supple-
mentation studies should not be restricted to usual analysis
of the major circulating form of vitamin D, 25[OH]D [15].
7 Are We Measuring the Right Thing?
As described earlier, in most clinical and athlete trials,
serum 25[OH]D concentration is measured as a marker of
vitamin D status because of its long half-life and close
relationship to vitamin D3 exposure (dermal synthesis or
dietary intake). Despite being highly relevant to total and
bioavailable vitamin D concentrations, VDBP is not
included in most studies examining vitamin D deficiency
and measures of health in athletes. Nevertheless, racial
differences in VDBP have been explored in the general
population to some degree. A recent study demonstrated
that community-dwelling Black subjects had lower levels
of VDBP and serum 25[OH]D (38.9 ± 0.5 nmol�l-1) than
White subjects (64.4 ± 0.9 nmol�l-1) [122]. However, the
authors
showed
that
Black
subjects
had
levels
of
bioavailable 25[OH]D similar to those of White subjects
(2.9 ± 0.1 and 3.1 ± 0.1 ng�ml-1, respectively), which may
explain why Black subjects presented with consistently
lower serum 25[OH]D but higher BMD compared with
White subjects [122].
This questions the validity of the commonly used lab-
oratory test for serum 25[OH]D concentrations in assessing
vitamin D deficiency in ethnically diverse groups. Con-
sistent with the ‘‘free hormone’’ hypothesis [14], several
recent studies have shown that some functions of vitamin D
may be more closely related to the free or bioavailable
fraction of vitamin D than to total serum 25[OH]D con-
centrations. For instance, the bioavailable fraction of cir-
culating 25[OH]D was more strongly associated with BMD
than the total levels in healthy adults [128]. Similar find-
ings have been observed between bioavailable 25[OH]D
and intact PTH, a marker of calcium balance related to
bone health [130]. Emerging research also suggests that
bioavailable vitamin D is a better predictor of BMD in an
ethnically diverse athletic population than serum 25[OH]D
concentration [131] and may provide insight into why no
universally accepted consensus for vitamin D levels cur-
rently exists. For practitioners who wish to measure
bioavailable vitamin D, this has been reported to be

VDBP with the three structural domains and known functional
regions is indicated. Domain I: amino acids 1–191; domain II:
192–378; domain III: 379–458; vitamin D binding: 35–49; C5a

 performed by competitive radioligand-binding assay [128]
and antibody-based assays [110], which are commercially
available laboratory kits. As with the measurement of total
25[OH]D, specialized laboratory equipment and personnel
trained in these techniques are required. No comparison of
techniques and establishment of a gold standard have yet
been reported.
As our understanding of vitamin D biology develops, it
is becoming clearer that determining true vitamin D status
is
multifactorial.
Systematic
screening
to
determine
25[OH]D concentrations in isolation is expensive and
demonstrates a poor relationship to bone health. If testing
is warranted, practitioners should use the appropriate
assays to determine bioavailable (free) vitamin D concen-
tration rather than total serum 25[OH]D and VDBP geno-
type, if possible.
8 Conclusions
The emerging body of evidence surrounding vitamin D and
athletic performance is bolstering support for the need to
control vitamin D concentration in athletes. Undoubtedly,
adverse risks are associated with vitamin D deficiency that
will affect athletic performance directly and indirectly.
New insights into the responses of the vitamin D metabo-
lome to supplementation, and emerging evidence sugges-
tive that free 25[OH]D may be a more useful marker of
vitamin D status, add new complexities to the area. Nev-
ertheless, the field moves closer to a more complete
understanding of the vitamin D endocrine system. The
purpose of our review was to collate the most recent
advances in this field and provide suggestions, based on
current understanding, as to how vitamin D can be man-
aged in practice. To this end, we have structured our
thoughts into a decision tree (Fig. 5) that we believe will
yield the most effective, safe protocols for those dealing
with a broad range of athletes. We hope to inform the field
that blanket approaches to supplementation, mega doses of
vitamin D, bolus doses of vitamin D, and lack of consid-
eration for an individualized approach should be avoided.
Finally, a note on the future direction of this field. It has
recently been proposed that misinterpretation of IoM
guidelines has led to the erroneous notion that any popu-
lation must have a serum concentration above the recom-
mended daily allowance for vitamin D to achieve good
bone health (as this is what the dietary reference values for
vitamin D have been developed upon) [13]. In addition,

 because of this misinterpretation, it was suggested that
vitamin D deficiency is in fact not epidemic. Although this
advice does raise the important point that guidelines should
be critically interpreted, it does not consider that vitamin D
has pleiotropic effects and may be required in higher
quantities in various tissues, as many trials have proposed.
Nor does it address the fact that measurement of total
serum 25[OH]D is not the most appropriate marker of
vitamin D status in ethnically diverse groups. Even
employing the correct measurement of free 25[OH]D may
be insufficient, as VDBP and VDR phenotype may also
affect the responsiveness to vitamin D [14, 132]. This leads
us to propose that the field is at a crucial turning point.
Before more work and funds are dedicated to identifying
what vitamin D targets and how, it is vital to understand the
relationship between free 25[OH]D, genotypes in the
vitamin D endocrine system, and health. Where such
measurements are made, controlling for VDBP and VDR
genotype and screening all possible and informative
aspects of the vitamin D metabolome will yield the most
useful results.
