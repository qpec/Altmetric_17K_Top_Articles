Background-—More intense and longer-lasting heat events are expected in the United States as a consequence of climate change.
This study aimed to project the potential changes in maternal heat exposure during early pregnancy (3–8 weeks post conception)
and the associated burden of congenital heart defects (CHDs) in the future.
Methods and Results-—This study expanded on a prior nationwide case-control study that evaluated the association between
CHDs and maternal heat exposure during early pregnancy in summer and spring. We defined multiple indicators of heat exposure,
and applied published odds ratios obtained for the matching season of the baseline (1995–2005) into the projection period (2025–
2035) to estimate potential changes in CHD burden throughout the United States. Increases in maternal heat exposure were
projected across the United States and to be larger in the summer. The Midwest will potentially have the highest increase in
summer maternal exposure to excessively hot days (3.42; 95% CI, 2.99–3.88 per pregnancy), heat event frequency (0.52; 95% CI,
0.44–0.60) and heat event duration (1.73; 95% CI, 1.49–1.97). We also found large increases in specific CHD subtypes during
spring, including a 34.0% (95% CI, 4.9%–70.8%) increase in conotruncal CHD in the South and a 38.6% (95% CI, 9.9%–75.1%)
increase in atrial septal defect in the Northeast.
Conclusions-—Projected increases in maternal heat exposure could result in an increased CHD burden in certain seasons and
regions of the United States. (J Am Heart Assoc. 2019;8:e010995. DOI: 10.1161/JAHA.118.010995)

 leading cause of infant morbidity and mortality in the United
States.8–10
Maternal heat exposure during early pregnancy may
directly cause fetal cell death or interfere with protein
synthesis via heat-shock proteins and induce severe fetal
malformations as observed in animal studies.11 As global
temperatures continue to rise, more intense, frequent, and
longer-lasting heat events are expected.12–14 Significant gaps
remain in understanding the potential impact of climate
change on maternal heat exposures and the associated CHD
burden. Existing projection studies frequently focus on
common diseases such as cardiovascular and respiratory
diseases; however, potential effects of temperature on
pregnancy outcomes were not typically examined.15–18 Cur-
rently, there remains a lack of studies projecting changes in
heat exposure during pregnancy or heat-related CHD burden.
Additionally, most prior heat-health projection studies either
have been limited to diseases other than reproductive
outcomes and small geographic areas or have used weather
projections from low-resolution global climate models that
result in elevated uncertainty and heat exposure misclassifi-
cation. Moreover, most of these studies used average ambient
temperature as a single heat definition.
Lin et al (2018)7 reported associations between CHDs and
maternal heat exposure during the critical gestational period
(3–8 weeks post conception) in multiple US regions during
spring and summer. Their findings revealed an elevated risk
based on CHD subtypes in spring and in regions with larger
temperature variations, or lower average temperature. The
present study was designed to expand on these findings by
projecting the US nationwide changes in maternal heat
exposure during early pregnancy and changes in CHD burden
for the years 2025 to 2035. We utilized multiple heat
exposure metrics that were based on spatially and temporally
high-resolution weather projections. Generally, all weather-
related diseases are preventable. Understanding maternal
heat exposure and the associated CHD burden under future
climate scenarios will assist in guiding public health practi-
tioners to develop early warning and preparedness programs
to modify behaviors with the aim of reducing CHD burden.
Methods
The health data used in this study are available from Lin et al
(2018). The high-resolution weather projection data are
available from coauthors at the US Environmental Protection
Agency, and the R Project for Statistical Computing code
developed for the study is available from the corresponding

Study Design
This study was based on NBDPS (National Birth Defects
Prevention Study), a multisite, large population-based case-
control study in the United States that investigated risk
factors for major structural birth defects.19,20 The NBDPS
spanned multiple regions including the South (Arkansas and
Texas), West (California), Midwest (Iowa), Southeast (North
Carolina and Georgia), Northeast (New York), and South-
west (Utah) regions, covering �482 000 births per year
from 1997 through 2007. As previously published,7,19,20
each CHD case (fetus or liveborn) was identified from the
state’s birth defects surveillance system in each NBDPS
site and reviewed by clinical geneticists adhering to specific
criteria.21,22 The controls consisted of nonmalformed live-
born infants, randomly selected from either birth certifi-
cates or hospitals in the same surveillance area as the
cases.
The present study included (1) obtaining baseline (1995–
2005) conditions, such as the odds ratio (OR) of CHDs and
populations at risk; (2) simulating the potential changes in
ambient temperature and subsequent maternal heat exposure
in a future projection period (2025–2035); and (3) predicting
changes in the associated CHD burden between 2 periods.
This study was approved by the NBDPS Data Sharing
Committee and Institutional Review Boards at each NBDPS
site. No informed consent was required.

Clinical Perspective
What Is New?
• High-resolution climate projections suggest future increases
in maternal heat exposure during early pregnancy across
the United States.
• The burden of congenital heart defects across the United
States may increase as a result of climate change.
• The estimated impact on the burden of congenital heart
defects varies across regions and seasons, as well as under
different definitions of heat exposure.
What Are the Clinical Implications?
• Pregnant women should be cautious of extreme heat
exposure, especially during early pregnancy.
• Increases in the occurrences and severity of extreme heat
events would increase the need for medical preparedness
and care for congenital heart defects.

 examined major CHD subtypes, including conotruncal heart
defects, left or right ventricular outflow tract obstruction,
and septal heart defects (ventricular septal defect [VSD]
and atrial septal defect [ASD]). Regions with significantly
elevated ORs were examined to estimate the potential
changes in CHD burden.
Number of CHDs and increase of live births
The number of CHDs at baseline, used as the base for
projection, were estimated from annual reports published by
the National Birth Defects Prevention Network (https://www.
nbdpn.org/ar.php). The number of live births in the United
States for the baseline and projection periods was obtained
from
the
National
Vital
Statistics
Reports
(https://
www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/births.htm), and the US Census
Bureau,23 respectively. The ratio of the number of live births
during the projection period to that at baseline (ratio �1.05)
was used to adjust for increases in live births.
Temperature and Exposure Simulations
Dynamic downscaling
The daily maximum temperature data were dynamically
downscaled (using a comprehensive physics-based weather
model rather than establishing statistical relationships) from
the Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project, Phase 5 of the
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.14 We used
climate projections from the ModelE2-R obtained from the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration/Goddard
Institute for Space Studies24 and dynamically downscaled to
high-resolutions using the Weather Research and Forecasting
model25 following methods from our previously published
work.26 By using dynamic downscaling, the temporal and
spatial discretization were increased, allowing us to create
hourly meteorologic fields over North America in 36936-km
grid cells for the baseline (1995–2005) and the future period
(2025–2035) that were each represented by 11 years of
modeled data. Data for the baseline represent the climatic
conditions that were typical during this period. The projection
period followed Representative Concentration Pathway 6.0,
which exhibits modest warming in 2030 compared with
2000.27 The data for the projection period were assumed to
be equally plausible in any given year following the warming
scenario. The dynamic downscaling produced hourly temper-
ature estimates at each 36936-km Weather Research and
Forecasting grid cell.

 estimates within each grid cell. The maximum, median, and
minimum of Tmax-cell in each region were used to represent
the
regional
daily
maximum
temperature
(Tmax-region).
According
to
demographic
statistics
from
the
United
Nations Statistics Division, there is only a slight seasonal
variation in the number of live births in the United States28;
therefore,
we
assumed
the
number
of
live
births
is
uniformly distributed throughout the year. Accordingly, to
evaluate the average heat exposure per pregnancy, we
assumed 1 conception per day. To be consistent with our
previous study,7 we focused on the average heat exposure
during the critical
gestational
period
(3–8 weeks after
conception) for pregnant women who have at least 1 day
of this critical period overlapping with spring or summer.
For each pregnancy and region, we defined (1) the count of
excessively hot days (EHD) as the number of days with
Tmax-region exceeding either the 90th (ie, EHD90) or 95th (ie,
EHD95) percentile for the same season of the baseline
period; (2) the frequency of extreme heat events (EHE) as
the number of occurrences of at least 3 consecutive
EHD90 days (ie EHE90) or 2 consecutive EHD95 days (ie
EHE95); (3) the duration of EHE as the number of days for
the longest EHE within the 42-day period. We calculated
these exposure metrics based on multiple definitions of
regional daily maximum temperature and excessively hot
days and averaged each metric for the season as described
previously.29
Prediction of CHD Burden Changes
The change in heat exposure was calculated between the
baseline and projection periods. For each region and season,
instead of estimating a single average heat exposure metric
for each period and a single indicator of change, we also
calculated the 95%CIs following the bootstrap framework,
resampling 1000 times from daily heat exposure metrics that
were used to estimate the average exposure for the 2
periods.
We
paired
these
calculations
with
associated
regional ORs and assessed the change in the number of
CHDs as:
Change ¼ Count0 � ðORDExposure � Ratio � 1Þ
where Count0 represents the seasonal number of CHDs
during the baseline period. We calculated the seasonal
estimates of cases by multiplying the annual reported
number by the proportion of days per season in a year.

with the baseline.
Results
We projected increases in temperature in all regions across
both seasons, regardless of the definition of regional daily
maximum temperature (Figure 1). We projected greater
temperature increases during the summer in the Midwest
(Iowa), Southeast (North Carolina/Georgia), and Northeast
(New York) compared with other regions. We also projected
larger variations of temperature for the South (Arkansas/
Texas) and West (California) during the summer and for the
Midwest and Northeast in spring, compared with other
regions. We further projected potential changes in maternal
heat exposure over the projection period by season, region,
and definition of extreme heat exposures, as presented in
Tables 1 and 2 and Figure 2. We projected general increases
in maternal heat exposure in most situations with larger
increases in summer than spring, especially when using the
EHE90 definition. In summer, the Midwest region was
projected to have the highest increase in maternal exposure
to excessively hot days, as well as in the frequency and
duration of exposure to EHE90, followed by the Northeast and
South regions. In spring, maternal heat exposure was
projected to increase the most in the South and Southwest,
followed by the Northeast and Midwest regions. In terms of
heat exposure definitions, the regional maximum of the grid-
cell-level daily maximum temperature may not reflect the
potential severity of heat exposure increase. We found that
heat exposures were projected to increase greatly when using
regional median or minimum of grid-cell-level daily maximum
temperature for all regions, except the Midwest and South-
east in summer, and for the South, West, and Southwest
regions in spring.
Because we previously observed positive associations
between maternal heat exposure and CHD, we further
estimated the potential associated changes in CHD burden
in this study. The estimated CHD burden may not change
substantially between 2 periods in the West, with fewer than
20 additional cases projected in most scenarios. However,
across other regions, hundreds to thousands of additional
CHD cases (increases of up to 62%; Figure 3) over the
projection period were estimated.
We projected larger changes in the CHD burden with
EHE95 as shown in Table 3. Although the Midwest was
projected to have the greatest relative increase in the
burden of certain CHD subtypes (Figure 3), the South and

 As a result, there may be �2607 additional total CHDs, 301
additional conotruncal heart defects, and 1573 additional
VSD cases estimated over the projection period. Moreover,
projected increases in the duration of exposure to spring
EHE95 may be associated with a 34.0% (95% CI, 4.9%–
70.8%) increase in conotruncal heart defects, and a 35.3%
(95% CI, 6.2%–72.1%) increase in VSDs. The duration of
similar exposures in the Northeast (Figure 3) may result in a
38.6% (95% CI, 9.9%–75.1%) increase in ASDs, a 17.9% (95%
CI, 7.2%–30.1%) increase in septal heart defects, and a
23.4% (95% CI, 9.9%–39.0%) increase in VSDs. We also
projected that septal defects may increase by 33.9% (95% CI,
14.9%–56.8%) because of maternal exposure to an increased
number of excessively hot days, resulting in 2555 additional
cases over the projection period. Similar changes were
projected with EHE90.
As demonstrated in Tables 1 through 3, although we
projected larger increases in maternal heat exposure in the
summer, we found more projected CHD increases in spring,
especially for the South and Northeast regions. In addition to
seasonal variation, we also observed differences between
CHD burden projections using different definitions of heat
exposure. For the Midwest, Southeast, and Northeast regions,
larger increases in CHD burden were projected when regional
daily maximum temperature was represented by the maxi-
mum of grid-cell-level daily maximum temperature, while for
other regions, CHD increases were projected to be larger with
the median or minimum temperature.
Discussion
Projected Increase in Maternal Heat Exposure
Our estimates suggest nationwide increases in maternal heat
exposure during early pregnancy across the United States by
2030. We observed that regardless of the definition (EHE 90
or EHE 95; maximum, median, or minimum) used for heat
exposure, increases were projected for pregnant women in all
regions and in both spring and summer, as well as for all
exposure metrics (number of excessively hot days, frequency,

 and duration of EHE). These increases were projected to be
stronger in the Midwest and Northeast regions in summer. We
also found that populations in the South and Southwest
regions may experience similar increases in heat exposure in
spring. Although few studies have assessed the impact of
climate change on maternal heat exposure, our estimates are
consistent with prior findings of the association between
increased ambient heat events and climate change. The global
coupled climate model ensembles suggest that several
regions in the Northern Hemisphere, including the United
States, may experience increased extreme heat severity in the
21st century.30 Specific atmospheric circulation patterns in
the United States that are intensified by ongoing increases in
greenhouse gases are expected to produce more future
extreme heat events.30
In addition, the US Census Bureau has projected a
continuous increase in births across the nation through
2030. It is estimated that the number of pregnant women may
increase nationwide by 5.0%, meaning 4.2 million would be
affected annually.23 The potential increases in both the
number of pregnant women and maternal heat exposure
suggest an alarming effect that climate change may have on
reproductive health.
Projected Increase in CHD Burden
Nationwide increases in CHD burden were also projected. We
found substantial variability in projected changes in regional
CHD burden potentially attributable to maternal heat expo-
sure. We projected that climate change could impose a
greater impact on pregnant women in the South, Northeast,
and Midwest regions compared with other regions, with
greater increases in CHD burden projected for these 3
regions. Large spatial differences in ambient temperature and
temperature ranges may be the most plausible explanation, as
suggested by Lin et al.7 In this study, we projected a larger
variation for daily maximum temperature in these regions.
Large temperature variation was previously suggested to be
associated with a higher risk of multiple health outcomes,
such as respiratory diseases, CHD, and mortality.31,32 Addi-
tionally, differences in heat acclimatization among pregnant
women from different regions of the United States may be
another reason for the spatial variation of CHD increase.
Loughnan et al33 and Lin et al7 suggested an increased heat
susceptibility for pregnant women in the Northeast and colder
areas in general due to insufficient physical or behavioral
adaptation. Moreover, it is possible that spatial differences in
other factors, such as land coverage, human activity patterns,
residential proximity to heavy traffic or industrial emissions,
and farming density among the different regions may also
contribute to spatial variations in CHDs.34,35 The 2009
National
Climate
Assessment
suggested
that
potential
increases in summer heat events in the midwestern United
States along with local socioeconomic compositions could
significantly increase the risk of morbidity.36,37
We projected higher increases in CHD burden for spring
and for certain CHD subtypes (conotruncal and septal defects)
compared with summer and other CHD subtypes, aligning
with our prior findings at baseline.7 Although no previous
study has clarified the reasoning behind the seasonal
difference in the CHD increase, some have suggested higher
health hazards of heat exposure in transitional seasons, such
as in spring.33,38,39 A plausible explanation is the poor
acclimation (ie, pregnant women do not quickly adapt
biologically and behaviorally to warming weather).33,40 The
underlying reasoning for differences by subtype remains
unknown. A potential possibility is that these subtypes have
larger sample sizes compared with others, increasing the
statistical power to detect an effect. Prior studies also found
that these defects are more susceptible to environmental
triggers.1,41,42
In terms of variation in CHD burden projections, our study
also suggested a potential influence of the definition of heat
exposure. As there is no gold standard to define heat
exposure indicators, we used multiple definitions, EHE90 or
EHE95, maximum, median, or minimum, in which 3 further
EHE definitions were used, including the number of exces-
sively hot days and frequency and duration of pregnancy
exposure to EHE. Among these indicators, we projected larger
increases in heat exposure with EHE90, but found more and
larger increases in CHD burden with EHE95. In addition, we
also projected larger increases in CHD burden for the
Midwest, Southeast, and Northeast regions with “maximum”
compared with “median” and “minimum” criteria. Therefore,
EHE95 and “maximum” might be sensitive indicators to
predict CHD burden related to global warming. Although no
previous studies compared these definitions, our study
provides insight for choosing optimal heat exposure indicators
that can better capture the potential impact of climate change
on human reproductive health.
Strengths and Uncertainties
To our knowledge, this is the first study to estimate future
changes in maternal heat exposure and its associated burden
on CHDs. In contrast to numerous studies that project heat-
related disease burden across small areas or based on low-
resolution global climate data,15–17 we dynamically down-
scaled the original weather projections to a local and hourly
scale to increase both the temporal and spatial resolutions in
this nationwide study. Additionally, our projections used
different heat indicators to capture a more comprehensive
picture of CHD burden increase associated with climate
change and to confirm the robustness of our projections.

 However, our findings need to be interpreted cautiously
due to uncertainties inherent in our methods. First, our
projections assumed that previously identified associations
between maternal heat exposure and CHD were true. We were
not able to exclude the possibility of Type I error attributable
to residual confounding in our previous study. However, we
attempted to minimize the confounding bias through the
following approaches:
1. To the best of our knowledge, our previous study has the
most comprehensive list of potential confounders among
the existing heat-CHD studies. For example, we screened
and
examined
multiple
major
confounders
including
maternal race/ethnicity, education level, body mass index,
infant sex, family history of CHD, and maternal lifestyle in
our analysis.
2. We also conducted multiple sensitivity analyses by com-
paring the results after excluding potential confounders,
such as pregestational diabetes mellitus, multiple birth,
and preterm birth to the original results, and found no
significant changes.
3. We rechecked all results using a Bayesian analysis
approach to address positive findings potentially due to
chance.
4. Our previous findings regarding specific CHD types
associated with maternal heat exposure were consistent
with most prior studies.1,42
Second, we assumed the heat-CHD association would
remain constant over time, while gradual population heat
adaptation was not considered. There is no approach available
to estimate the heat adaptation rate for future pregnancies.
However, a study from New York City suggested a 4.6%
decrease in the risk of heat-related mortality per decade over
the 20th century.43 When the same rate was applied to the
current study, CHD burden projections would be reduced by
1-(1-0.046)3 (�13%). However, the total increasing trend in
the burden of heat-related CHD was still not significantly
altered. Additionally, we projected only for situations in which
associated elevated ORs were observed in the baseline
period. Since the heat exposures were projected to increase
in most regions, it is possible that areas with statistically
insignificant findings may evolve to be significant over time.
For example, although few associations were observed with
EHE95 in the Midwest, 18 of 30 (60%) OR estimates were
>1.0.7 The percentage of insignificant increases of CHD (OR
>1) related to maternal heat exposure was 53% for the South,
47% for the Southeast, 73% for the Northeast, 53% for the
Southwest, and 67% for the West, suggesting a possibility of
much larger numbers of CHD increases in the future than we
expected. Therefore, CHD increases attributable to increased
pregnancy heat exposure might be a major concern in the
United States.
It must be noted that our results are based on climate
projections downscaled from a single climate scenario. Although
our baseline and future projections each spanned 11 years, this
may not account for the full range of internal variability in the
Earth’s climate system. Additionally, there is significant uncer-
taintyinhumanemissions of carbondioxide and other greenhouse
gases, as well as the extent to which society will act to mitigate
climate change. Other climate scenarios and models may differ in
the spatial distribution and magnitude of warming and the
resultant increases in projected cases of CHDs.
Although we adjusted for the potential increase in live
births, we assumed that maternal demographic composition
such as race and ethnicity would remain constant with the
baseline. However, the US Census Bureau suggested approx-
imately a 10% increase in the Hispanic population between
the projection and baseline periods.23 We reran the analysis
based on this estimate and found relative to the “white non-
Hispanic” group, the OR of total CHD for “black non-
Hispanic,” “Hispanic,” and “Other races” was 1.08 (95% CI,
0.96–1.21), 1.07 (95% CI, 0.98–1.17) and 1.13 (95% CI, 0.97–
1.31), respectively. This suggests that changes in maternal
demographic characteristics might not substantially modify
CHD burden projections in the current study.
Our findings indicate a potential adverse impact, that is,
increased burden of CHDs, of global warming. Our results
provide useful metrics and maps for policy makers involved in
preparedness and resource allocation for climate change
adaptation. Even with significant actions taken to mitigate
climate change, temperatures are likely to continue to
increase later in the 21st century.44 Thus, our estimations
reflect an outcome that should be relevant (regardless of the
climate scenario and model) and a trend that will continue
toward the end of the 21st century.
In conclusion, our findings reveal a potential nationwide
increase in future maternal heat exposure in the United
States. Exposure increases may be larger in summer,
especially for the Midwest, followed by the Northeast and
South regions. However, increases in the CHD burden can
occur more in spring, especially in the South and Northeast
regions for septal and conotruncal CHDs. We also found that
EHE95 and maximum temperature might be sensitive indica-
tors to predict the CHD burden associated with increasing
occurrences and severity of extreme heat events. Our findings
and geographic vulnerability maps provide useful information
for policy makers in preparing and allocating resources for
adapting to climate change.
