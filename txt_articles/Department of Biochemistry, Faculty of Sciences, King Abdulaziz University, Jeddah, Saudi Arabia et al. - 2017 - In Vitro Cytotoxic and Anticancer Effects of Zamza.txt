Abstract
Background: Zamzam water is naturally alkaline and rich in a variety of minerals 
which may represent a powerful tool for cancer therapy. In this research, the cytotoxic effects of 
Zamzam water were investigated in human lung cancer (A549) cell line and compared with human 
skin fibroblasts (HSF). 
Methods: Two different preparations of Zamzam water were used: Z1, with pH adjusted 
to 7.2 and Z2, with no pH adjustment. The effects of both treatments on the morphology of the 
A549 and HSF cell lines were investigated. The cell viability of HSF and A549 cells was identified 
by the MTT assay and trypan blue exclusion. Detection of apoptotic cells and cell cycle analyses 
were determined using flow cytometry. Moreover, reactive oxygen species (ROS) were measured 
for both cell lines. 
Results: Both Zamzam water treatments, Z1 and Z2 showed reductions in the cell 
viability of A549 cells. Cell death occurred via necrosis among cells treated with Z2. Cell cycle 
arrest occurred in the G0/G1 phases for cells treated with Z2. Cellular and mitochondrial ROS 
productions were not affected by either treatment. 
Conclusion: Our findings indicate that Zamzam water might have potential therapeutic 
efficacy for lung cancer.

Introduction
Lung cancer is a life-threatening disease 
and has currently become the number one killer 
among cancers worldwide (1). It is the leading 
cause of cancer-related mortality in the United 
States, China and the Arab countries (2). Lung 
cancer has a dismal five-year survival rate of 
15% (3). Timely detection, as well as diet and 
food supplements have been associated with an 
increase or decrease in lung cancer risk.  
Water has been used historically as a 
healer due to its many properties, such as a high 
mineral content and high pH value (4). Roman 
bath water and the Dead Sea water were used 
to heal many skin problems, and deep-sea water 
has been mentioned as hydrotherapy for various 
body systems (5) and for inhibiting metastasis 
in human breast cancer cell lines (6). Moreover, 
alkaline water was reported to reduce oxidative 
stress and hemorrhagic gastric lesions in rats (7).
Zamzam 
water 
is 
naturally 
alkaline 
and it comes from an ancient well located in 
Makkah, Saudi Arabia. Millions of people have 
used it since the time of Prophet Ibrahim as a 
holy natural water for its exceptional healing

properties. It is rich in a variety of minerals 
and has a high pH value (average pH of 8) (8). 
Moreover, no bacteria can form at the source 
of or in Zamzam water (9). It was reported 
that Zamzam water has the ability to prevent 
the formation of renal stones in kidney-stone 
induced rats (10) and to reduce the oxidative 
stress in type 2 diabetic patients (11).  
Oxidative stress is associated with many 
diseases and their complications. One reason 
of such an oxidant/antioxidants imbalance 
is dietary deficiencies in essential elements, 
which are important components of antioxidant 
enzymes (12). The aim of this study is to 
illustrate the cytotoxic and anticancer properties 
of Zamzam water in human lung cancer cell line 
(A549).

Human lung cancer cell line (A549) was 
purchased from the immunology laboratory, 
King Fahad Medical Research Center (KFMRC), 
and normal human skin fibroblast (HSF) cell 
line was purchased from the virology laboratory,

Abdulaziz University (91831/37/D).
Zamzam water source
Zamzam water was obtained directly from 
Zamzam well, which is located within the Holy 
Mosque in Makkah, Saudi Arabia, 20 m (66 ft) 
east of the Kaaba. The well is about 30 m (98 ft) 
deep and 1.08 to 2.66 m (3 ft 7 in to 8 ft 9 in) in 
diameter. The water was stored in sterilised glass 
bottles and kept at room temperature until it was 
used.
Preparation of culture media
DMEM 
growth 
media 
stock 
was 
supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% L-glutamine, 
1% antibiotics, and 1% NEAAs. 
Preparation of Zamzam water treatments and 
the negative control
In this study, two different Zamzam water 
samples, designated Z1 and Z2, and one negative 
control were prepared. To prepare Z1 and Z2 
treatments, a PBS tablet was dissolved in 800 ml 
of Zamzam water and the pH was either adjusted 
to 7.2 (Z1) or not adjusted (pH = 8, Z2). The 
negative control was PBS only. 
Morphological changes
A549 and HSF cells were seeded in 25 cm² 
flasks at a concentration of 8x105 cells/ml. After 
24 h of incubation, changes in cell morphology 
were photographed using a Nikon Eclipse 
microscope at 10x magnification for Z1 and Z2 
and were compared to the control. 
Cell viability assay
1. 
Trypan blue exclusion
A549 and HSF cells were treated under the 
same conditions described in the (morphological 
changes) section. After 24 h, when the cultured 
cells were 60%–70% confluent, they were treated 
with trypan blue dye (0.2%) and counted with a 
hemocytometer.
2. MTT assay
Three 
independent 
experiments 
were 
performed to assess the cytotoxic effects of 
Zamzam water on A549 and HSF cells. A549 
and HSF cells were seeded in a 96-well tissue 
culture plate at a concentration of 1×104 cells/
well and incubated for 24 h at 37 °C/5% CO2. 
After, the culture medium was replaced with 
200 µl of Z1 or Z2 or with 200 µl of PBS only as 
a negative control. MTT assay was performed by 
adding 20 µl of MTT dye and incubated for 2 h at 
 
37 °C/5% CO2. Then, treatments were discarded

and the precipitates were dissolved in 200 µl of 
isopropyl. The developed colour intensity was 
measured at 490 nm using a BioTek microplate 
reader.
Determination of cell death type by annexin-V/
PI assay
To detect early and late apoptosis in A549 
and HSF cell lines, 8×105 cells/ml were seeded in 
25 cm² flasks until they became 70% confluent. 
After, cells were incubated with Z1 or Z2 and 
with the negative control medium for 24 h. 
Then, the annexin-V/PI assay was carried out 
according to the manufacture instructions using 
a Beckman Coulter flow cytometer to acquire a 
minimum of 10,000 events in the gated regions. 
For cells labelled with annexin V-FITC, the 
emission wavelength was 520 nm; meanwhile, 
for cells labelled with PI, an emission wavelength 
of 620 nm was used.
Cell cycle analysis
A549 and HSF cells were seeded in 25 
cm² flasks at a concentration of 8×105 cells/
ml. When cells were 60%–70% confluent, they 
were treated with Z1 and Z2 for 24 h followed by 
trypsinisation. Pellets were washed twice with 
PBS then cells were fixed with 1ml of ice-cold 
fixing buffer (70% ethanol in PBS) and incubated 
overnight at 4 °C. After 24 h, the fixation buffer 
was discarded and cells were re-suspended in 
500 µl PBS followed by 5 µl of 5mM RNase. Cells 
were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C, dyed with 
5 µl PI (1 mg/ml), and analysed with the BD 
FACSCalibur flow cytometer. At least, 10,000 
events were acquired in the list mode using an 
emission wavelength of 620 nm.  
Measurement of cellular reactive oxygen species 
(ROS)
ROS levels in A549 were measured using 
the H2DCFDA dye. A549 cells were seeded 
in 25 cm² flasks at a density of 8×105 cells/
ml and treated with Z1 and Z2 culture media 
for 24 h.  Cells were incubated in the dark with 
5 µl of DCFDA for 30 min at 37 °C/5% CO2. 
DCF fluorescence was read at an excitation 
wavelength of 485 nm and at an emission 
wavelength of 528 nm using the BioTek 
fluorescence microplate reader.  
Measurement of mitochondrial reactive oxygen 
species (mtROS)
The superoxide levels in A549 cell line 
incubated with Z1 and Z2 were measured with 
MitoSOX dye using the BioTek fluorescence 
microplate reader according to the manufacture’s 
instructions. The resulting red fluorescence was 
detected at excitation and emission wavelengths 
of 530 nm and 590 nm, respectively.
Statistical analysis 
The data were analysed using GraphPad 
Prism software version 6. All experiments 
were performed at least three times to ensure 
reproducibility. 
Significant 
differences 
were 
evaluated using P-values by the Kruskal–Wallis 
test followed by Dunn’s multiple comparison 
tests. The cut-off level for significance was 
 
< 0.05.
Results
Morphological changes
The antiproliferative effects of the two 
Zamzam treatments (Z1 and Z2) on A549 and 
HSF cell lines are shown in Figures 1A and 1B. 
The changes in the cell membranes of A549 cells 
were more obvious in the high-alkaline medium 
(Z2) than in the adjusted pH treatment (Z1). In 
contrast, the same treatments had no effect on 
HSF cells, which appeared intact when compared 
to the control.  
Cell viability assessment by trypan blue 
exclusion and MTT assay
The effects of Zamzam water treatments 
on cell viability were assessed using a trypan 
blue cell count and MTT assay. In both assays, 
only Zamzam water treatment (Z2) was found 
to decrease cancer cell viability significantly 
in A549 cell line compared to the untreated 
control. In trypan blue cell count, A549 cell 
viability was reduced to 68.66% (Z1 treatment) 
and 54% (Z2 treatment) (Figure 2A), whereas 
HSF cells showed no significant differences in 
the cell viability when incubated with Z1 and Z2 
(103.66% and 105.8%, respectively).
MTT assay showed that the cancer cell 
viability was decreased to 79% and 73% after 
treatment with Z1 and Z2, respectively when 
compared to the untreated A549 cells (Figure 
2B). The same treatment showed insignificant 
effects on the viability of the HSF cells (95.02% 
and 97.9% with Z1 and Z2, respectively).

Determination of cell death type
The necrosis phenomenon was significantly 
induced only in A549 cells treated with Zamzam 
water treatment (Z2) compared to the untreated 
control and Z1 treatment. The percentage of 
early apoptosis was 0.75%, 0.7%, and 1% in the 
control, Z1, and Z2 treatments, respectively. In 
the late apoptotic stage, there was no significant 
increases between the untreated control cells and 
Z1-treated cells (1.5% and 1.4%, respectively), 
whereas in Z2-treated cells, the percentage of 
apoptosis increased to 3.9% compared to the 
untreated control. Regarding necrosis, only Z2 
treatment showed a significant effect compared 
to the untreated control and Z1 treatment. The 
percentages of necrosis in A549 cells were 1.9%, 
4.7%, and 6.65% (P < 0.05) in the control, Z1, 
and Z2, treatments, respectively (Figures 3A 
and 3B). For normal HSF cells, Zamzam water 
treatments did not show any significant effect in 
all apoptotic and necrotic stages. The percentage 
of early apoptosis in HSF remained as low as 3%, 
3.5%, and 2.8% for the untreated control, Z1, and 
Z2 treatments, respectively, whereas in the late 
apoptotic stage, the percentages were 0.78%, 
1.32%, and 0.85%, respectively. In the necrotic 
stage, the lowest percentages were, 0.2%, 0.12%, 
and 0.08% for the control and treated cells, 
respectively (Figures 3C and 3D).
Effect of Zamzam treatments on cell cycle
 For the cell cycle analysis, Z2 treatment 
showed a significant effect on A549 cells. There 
was a significant increase in the cell population 
treated with Z2 (arrest in the G0/G1 phase) 
while the S phase was not affected by the 
treatment. The percentages of A549 cells in the 
G0/G1 phase were 38.6%, 37.9%, and 52% for 
the control, Z1, and Z2 treatments, respectively. 
Moreover, the percentages of cells in the S phase 
were 18.3%, 17%, and 17.2%, respectively, while 
in the G2 phase, the percentages were 10.8%, 
20%, and 10.4% for the control, Z1 and Z2 
treatments, respectively (Figure 4B).
In contrast to A549 cells, the same Zamzam 
water treatment used on normal HSF cells 
showed no significant effect (P > 0.05) in the 
G1, S, and G2 phases compared to the control, as 
presented in Figure 4D. The percentages of HSF 
cells in the G1 phase were 54.1%, 52.75%, and 
56.26% for the control, Z1, and Z2 treatments, 
respectively. The percentages of cells in the S 
phase were 17.33%, 17.33%, and 12%, while in 
the G2 phase, the percentages were 12.38%, 
10.7%, and 12.22% for the controls, Z1, and Z2 
treatments, respectively.
Cellular and mitochondrial ROS measurement
Cellular 
and 
mitochondrial 
ROS 
(superoxide anion) productions were not affected 
by Z1 and Z2 treatments when compared to the 
untreated control cells (P > 0.05) (Figure 5A). 
The intensity of cellular ROS formation by Z1 was 
43.75 RFU, while the cellular ROS production 
of Z2 treatment was 46.75 RFU compared to the 
control, which was 51.25 RFU.  Moreover, the 
florescent intensity of the mtROS formation of 
Z1 treatment was 16,067 RFU while the mtROS

Discussion
Lung 
cancer 
incidence 
is 
considered 
the highest among malignant tumors. It has 
become the leading cause of cancer-related 
deaths worldwide, including in Saudi Arabia 
(13). Resistances to treatment with anticancer 
drugs and toxic side effects have resulted in the 
need for new anticancer treatments with little 
or no side effects (14). To date there are limited 
studies on the effects of alkaline water on cancer 
cells. In this study, the cytotoxic and apoptotic 
effects of Zamzam water on A549 cells were 
investigated for the first time and compared to 
the effects of Zamzam water on normal HSF 
cells. 
Our results showed that the incubation 
of A549 cells with Zamzam water inhibited 
growth and proliferation and changed the 
morphology of A549 cells. Although it is unclear 
which component of Zamzam water affects 
the proliferation of cancer cells, it is presumed 
that the combined ionic actions of several 
minerals such as calcium, magnesium, lead, 
arsenate, lithium, cadmium-zinc combinations 
and selenium may play an important role in 
mediating the inhibition of proliferation of 
cancer cells. Our results were in contrast to 
previous studies that have shown that minerals 
such as lead, arsenate (15), lithium (16), 
cadmium-zinc combinations (17), and selenium 
(18), are capable of inhibiting the proliferation 
of normal and cancerous cells. Interestingly, the 
proliferation of HSF cells was not affected by 
treatment of Zamzam water, suggesting that this 
water might have selective cytotoxic effects, but 
the exact mechanism is unclear.
Pettersson et al. (19) have found that As2O3 
induced small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) 
cytotoxicity and has been shown to involve 
several different cell death pathways (apoptosis 
and necrosis). Moreover, cell death is mainly 
due to caspase-independent necrotic cell death, 
whereas the involvement of apoptosis is more 
cell line-dependent (19). Our results indicate 
that Z1 treatment did not induce cell death in 
A549 lung cancer cells. On the other hand, Z2 
treatment caused necrotic cell death. These 
effects could be due to the unique combination of 
minerals in Zamzam water, arsenic and cadmium 
might be responsible for inducing cell death in 
A549 cells. Furthermore, the high pH value of 
Zamzam water is another important feature, as

the pH of Zamzam ranges from 7.9–8 compared 
to the ordinary water, which ranges from 6.5–8 
(11, 12). Studies on cancer have shown that 
the oral administration of sodium bicarbonate 
increases the extracellular pH of tumors and 
reduces the formation of spontaneous metastasis 
(20). The extracellular pH of malignant tumors 
is acidic (pH 6.5–6.9) compared to the pH of 
normal tissues, which is more alkaline (pH 7.2–
7.5) (21). 
In normal cells, ROS plays an important 
role in regulating various biological pathways. 
The cell balances the generation of ROS thereby 
controlling it. In our study, ROS level in A549 
cell line was investigated to assess the role of 
ROS in the induction of apoptosis after exposure 
to Zamzam treatments. Our data demonstrated 
that cellular ROS formation and mitochondrial 
ROS production were not significantly induced in 
A549 cells. 
To further elucidate the possibility of cell 
growth arrest, cell cycle phases were evaluated 
using a flow cytometry assay. Our data showed 
that cells were arrested in the G0/G1 phase for 
Z2-treated cells, while Z1-treated cells were 
unaffected. The percentages of A549 cells in the 
G0/G1 phase were 38.6%, 37.9%, and 52% for 
the control, Z1, and Z2 treatments (P ≤ 0.01), 
respectively. The percentage of cells in the G2/M 
phase increased in cells treated with Z1, with 
percentages of 10.8%, 20%, and 10.4% for the 
control, Z1, and Z2 treatments, respectively. It 
was reported previously that cancer cells treated 
with arsenic trioxide were arrested at either 
the G1 or the G2/M phase (22). In addition, it 
has been found that arrest in G2/M phase that 
occurs in human cancer cell lines by arsenic 
trioxide is due to an increase in cyclin B level, a 
regulatory protein involved in mitosis (23, 24). 
De Groot and his colleagues (25) observed a 
significant accumulation of renal cells in the G2 
phase after lithium treatment when compared 
to their controls. It is well known that cyclin D1 
and cyclin E are regulatory proteins that control 
the transition from G1 to S phase, whereas, 
cyclin B1 regulates the progression of the G2/M 
phase. Recently, a study reported that a low-
concentration of inorganic arsenic inhibits 
the proliferation of C2C12 myoblasts cells by 
inducing G1 and G2/M phase cell-cycle arrest 
due to the decrease in the protein expressions 
of cyclin D1, cyclin E, and cyclin B1 (26). In this 
study, it was assumed that the arresting effect 
of Z1 and Z2 in A549 cells might be due to the 
decreased levels of cyclin D1, cyclin E, and cyclin 
B1 caused by both the effect of both the alkaline 
pH and the elements found naturally in Zamzam 
water. Our results revealed that HSF cells were 
unaffected by both Zamzam water treatments. 
It was demonstrated that the concentrations of 
calcium and magnesium ions in Zamzam water 
were almost double the concentrations found in 
bottled water (8). Calcium has been implicated 
in the induction of apoptosis via the activation 
of caspase 12. Previous reports have suggested 
that the intake of calcium reduces the risk of 
colon and breast cancers (27, 28). Moreover, 
magnesium deficiency is also associated with the 
metastasis of cancer cells. Thus, Zamzam water 
may be a beneficial source, providing the proper 
ratio of calcium and magnesium and other 
elements. However, previous research studies 
have reported that alkaline-reduced water has 
potent antioxidant activity and anticancer effects 
and it has been shown to protect DNA from 
oxidative damage (29). 
Conclusion 
In conclusion, according to the results 
obtained from all previous experiments, Zamzam 
water might be a promising anticancer agent. 
Further researches are needed on the different 
types of cancer cell lines to investigate the 
cytotoxic and anticancer effects of Zamzam water 
on these cancers. In addition, in vivo studies are 
necessary to investigate the effects of Zamzam 
water on experimental animals with induced 
cancers.
