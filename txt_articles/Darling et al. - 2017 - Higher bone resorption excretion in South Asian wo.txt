Few data exist on bone resorption in Western dwelling South Asian women. 
Bone resorption was assessed in premenopausal and postmenopausal South Asian and Caucasian 
women living in Southern England. 
Premenopausal South Asians had higher bone resorption than same-age Caucasians, and had similar 
bone resorption to postmenopausal South Asians. 
Non-linear mixed modelling analysis suggested that individuals with a higher seasonal change in

Abstract  
 
Few data exist on bone turnover in South Asian women and it is not well elucidated as to 
whether Western dwelling South Asian women have different bone resorption levels to that of 
women from European ethnic backgrounds.  This study  assessed bone resorption levels in 
UK dwelling South Asian and Caucasian women as well as evaluating whether seasonal 
variation in 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] is associated with bone resorption in either 
ethnic group.  
 
Data for seasonal measures of urinary N-telopeptide of collagen (uNTX) and serum 25(OH)D 
were analysed from n=373 women (four groups; South Asian postmenopausal n=44, South 
Asian premenopausal n=50, Caucasian postmenopausal n=144, Caucasian premenopausal n 
=135) (mean (± SD) age 48 (14) years; age range 18-79 years) who participated in the 
longitudinal D-FINES (Diet, Food Intake, Nutrition and Exposure to the Sun in Southern 
England) cohort study (2006-2007).    
 
A mixed between-within subjects ANOVA (n=192) showed a between subjects effect of the 
four groups (P<0.001) on uNTX concentration, but no significant main effect of season 
(P=0.163). Bonferroni adjusted Post hoc tests (P≤0.008) suggested that there was no 
significant difference between the postmenopausal Asian and premenopausal Asian groups.  
Season specific age-matched-pairs analyses showed that in winter (P=0.04) and spring 
(P=0.007), premenopausal Asian women had a 16 to 20 nmol BCE/mmol Cr higher uNTX 
than premenopausal Caucasian women.

The (amplitude/mesor) ratio (i.e. seasonal change) for 25(OH)D was predictive of uNTX, 
with estimate(SD)=0.213 (0.015) and 95% CI (0.182, 0.245; P<0.001) in a non-linear mixed 
model (n=154).  This showed that individuals with a higher seasonal change in 25(OH)D, 
adjusted for overall 25(OH)D concentration, showed increased levels of uNTX.  Although the 
effect size was smaller than for the amplitude/mesor ratio, the mesor for 25(OH)D 
concentration was also predictive of uNTX, with estimate(SD)= -0.035 (0.004), and 95% CI 
(-0.043, -0.028); P<0.001). 
 
This study demonstrates higher levels of uNTX in premenopausal South Asian women than 
would be expected for their age, being greater than same-age Caucasian women, and similar 
to postmenopausal Asian women.  This highlights potentially higher than expected bone 
resorption levels in premenopausal South Asian women which, if not offset by concurrent 
increased bone formation, may have future clinical and public health implications which 
warrant further investigation. Individuals with a larger seasonal change in 25(OH)D 
concentration showed an increased bone resorption, an association which was larger than that 
of the 25(OH)D yearly average, suggesting it may be as important clinically to ensure a stable 
and steady 25(OH)D concentration, as well as one that is high enough to be optimal for bone 
health.

1.0 Introduction  
 
Despite the hypothetical increase in osteoporotic fracture risk due to smaller bone size in 
postmenopausal South Asian women [1]  few studies have assessed bone health in this 
population group.   Also, recent epidemiological research has suggested that US dwelling 
South Asian women have an increased prevalence of femoral neck osteoporosis [2] but have 
no differences in wrist fracture rates [2] compared with same-age Caucasian women, 
suggesting that bone health in South Asian women needs further elucidation. 
 
Bone turnover markers are a known predictor of fracture risk [3] as well as giving valuable 
insight into the bone turnover related mechanisms underlying inter-individual differences in 
bone structure.  However, there is a lack of information on bone turnover rates in South Asian 
women, either western dwelling, or dwelling in country of origin.  Only three studies, to the 
authors’ knowledge [4-6] have reported levels of bone turnover activity in migrant South 
Asian women living in Western countries.  These studies found either no difference in bone 
turnover between South Asian and Caucasian populations [4, 5] or no difference between 
older and younger South Asian women [6], the latter result of which is of concern considering 
the premenopausal status of the younger women. These cross-sectional studies highlight 
important similarities and differences between bone turnover in western dwelling South Asian 
and Caucasian women.  However, there is still a need for studies to assess longitudinal change 
in bone turnover markers over the course of at least one year in South Asian women to see if 
these ethnic and age differences in bone turnover vary by season, and if so how.

There is also a need to understand the relationship between vitamin D status and bone 
resorption, specifically how this relationship may be mediated by season, menopausal status 
or ethnicity.  It is known that adequate vitamin D status is important for bone health, with 
associations between bone turnover and 25(OH)D status being found in Caucasian 
populations in some studies [7, 8].  However, it is relatively unknown as to whether there is 
an association between 25(OH)D status and bone turnover in South Asian women, with the 
only published study (UK) finding no cross-sectional relationship [4].  The known lower 
25(OH)D status in many Western dwelling South Asian women, as compared to Caucasian 
women [4, 9-11], suggests theoretically that the relationship between 25(OH)D and bone 
turnover may be stronger in South Asian women, but more research is required to establish 
whether this is the case. 
 
In addition to that of overall average yearly 25(OH)D concentrations, degree of annual 
fluctuation in 25(OH)D could also theoretically influence bone health.  This is because 
changes in 25(OH)D substrate have a large impact on the activity of the 1-hydroxylase 
enzyme, which is one of the main hydroxylase enzymes controlling 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D 
[1,25(OH)2D] levels, and at physiological concentrations of 25(OH)D is working well below 
its Michaelis-Menten constant [Km].  Large changes in the activity of the 1-hydroxylase 
enzyme could occur as a result of large seasonal fluctuations in 25(OH)D and have an impact 
on 1,25(OH)2D concentration [12].  Some previous research studies in Caucasian populations 
have found no relationship between seasonal fluctuation of 25(OH)D and bone resorption [13] 
or no acute effect of vitamin D supplementation during winter time (to blunt the seasonal 
rhythm) on bone resorption or formation markers [14].  However, data from South Asian and 
Caucasian populations in the D-FINES (Vitamin D, Food Intake, Nutrition and Exposure to

Sunlight in Southern England) cohort study suggested that a larger change in 25(OH)D over 
the course of a year was associated with increased bone turnover [uCTX], in comparison to 
those with a smaller change in 25(OH)D [15]. However, subject numbers were relatively 
small and only sCTX levels were measured.   
 
The present work is a larger follow-up analysis of the D-FINES cohort.  We investigate  
whether there is a difference (within and between seasons) in bone resorption (uNTX) 
between Caucasian and South Asian women, when adjusted for confounding factors, as well 
as examining whether there is a relationship between serum 25(OH)D concentration and bone 
resorption in either ethnic group. We also determine the relative abilities of seasonal change 
and average 25(OH)D to predict bone resorption over the course of one year, using a non-
linear mixed modelling approach.  Based on the results of our previous analysis [15], as well 
as the above literature, it was hypothesised that South Asian women would have increased 
bone resorption as compared with their Caucasian counterparts.  It was also predicted there 
would be an association between 25(OH)D status and bone resorption within seasons, and that 
individuals showing a high degree of seasonal fluctuation in 25(OH)D over the course of the 
year would also show higher bone resorption than those with a lower degree of seasonal 
fluctuation in 25(OH)D.

2.0 Materials and Methods   
 
2.1 Study Design 
Subjects had taken part in the 2006-2007 UK Food Standards Agency D-FINES study 
(Project N05064) [9], whereby they attended the University of Surrey once per season for one 
year (four visits) for sampling of blood for measurement of 25(OH)D status and of urine for 
measurement of uNTX, as well as for collection of anthropometric, dietary and lifestyle 
information. Data from n =373 women (South Asian postmenopausal n=44, South Asian 
premenopausal n=50, Caucasian postmenopausal n=144, Caucasian premenopausal n =135) 
was available for analysis. Menopausal status was derived from the date of the last menstrual 
period (self-reported), with postmenopausal status being defined as the participant having had 
no menstrual periods for >3 months. Any postmenopausal women who had used hormone 
replacement therapy in the last year were excluded from the study. Further details regarding 
the D-FINES study, including subject recruitment, study procedure, other exclusion criteria 
and background information have been previously reported [9]. In accordance with the ethical 
standards laid down in the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki, ethical reviews were obtained from 
relevant Research Ethics Committees (National Health Service NHS REC 06/Q1909/1, and 
University of Surrey EC/2006/19/SBMS). Written, informed consent was obtained from all 
participants.   
 
2.2 Biochemical Measurements 
Measurement of uNTX was undertaken at the University of Sheffield (Metabolic Bone 
Centre, Northern General Hospital, Sheffield, UK), funded by a grant (number 225) from the 
National Osteoporosis Society (2011).  Measurements were undertaken using the automated

Vitros ECi, Ortho Clinical Diagnostics analyser (Rochester NY, USA) and were adjusted for 
creatinine (Cr) excretion. Serum 25(OH)D was measured by the Vitamin D Research Group 
at the University of Manchester, using the manual IDS enzyme immunoassay 
(Immunodiagnostic Systems Ltd, Boldon, Tyne and Wear, UK) with inter-assay and intra-
assay coefficients as described previously [9].  
 
2.3 Statistical methods, including Non-Linear Mixed Modelling Analysis 
Ethnic and menopausal status differences in uNTX were analysed using mixed between-
within subject analysis of variance (ANOVA; women with all four uNTX measurements). 
Within-season ANCOVA was also conducted (using all women with at least one uNTX 
measurement) to allow for the analysis of data from women who did not have full data for 
uNTX for all seasons (to reduce the impact of attendance bias).  For the premenopausal 
women only, an age-matched analysis was also undertaken due to a biologically significant 
age difference between the two premenopausal groups (mean (SD) for age: 34.0 (5.6) years in 
the Caucasians and 39.0 (8.5) years in the South Asians). The premenopausal South Asian 
women were individually matched to one same-age (to the exact year) premenopausal 
Caucasian. When there were multiple Caucasian women of the same age available, SPSS was 
used to randomly choose one Caucasian subject to be matched to each South Asian subject.  
Finally, to assess the relationship between 25(OH)D and uNTX Pearson’s bivariate and 
partial correlations were conducted. The statistical package SPSS (v21, 2013, Chicago IL) 
was used to analyse baseline participant data and conduct the ANOVA, ANCOVA and 
correlation analyses.  When statistically significant sphericity (P>0.05) was present in the 
ANOVA analyses the Greenhouse-Geisser estimate was used.

Non-linear mixed modelling (NLM) was used to assess whether individuals with increased 
seasonal change in 25(OH)D would show increased bone resorption (uNTX). This modelling 
procedure has been used previously in the D-FINES cohort and described in detail [15].  In 
summary, the NLMIXED procedure, of the SAS (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA) software 
suite was used to conduct the non-linear mixed modelling analysis. BMI and ethnic-
menopausal status were considered potential confounders, and were retained in the model at 
all times.  Regression parameters significantly different from zero within the limits of the 
conventional 95% confidence interval were deemed statistically significant.  The flow of 
participants through the various analyses in the manuscript is illustrated in Supplementary 
Figure 1.

3.0 Results  
 
3.1 Participant Characteristics  
Results are presented as mean (SD) unless otherwise stated. Supplementary Table 1 shows the 
baseline characteristics of the D-FINES participants included in the ANOVA analysis 
(n=192) including 25(OH)D and uNTX concentration in each season and anthropometric 
information. Mean (SD) for age was 52 (13) years and dietary calcium intake was 859 (269) 
mg/d. Mean (SD) for BMI was 26.2 (4.5) Kg/m2, thus the participants on average were 
classified as overweight.  Depending on season, concentrations of 25(OH)D ranged from 
41.4-62.9 nmol/L and for uNTX ranged from 54.0-55.5 nmol BCE/mmol Cr.  Supplementary 
Table 2 shows background information for the subset of the women who had complete data 
for all relevant variables for the NLM analysis (n=154).   
 
3.2 Levels of bone resorption markers by ethnic menopausal group 
3.2.1 uNTX by ethnic-menopausal group 
uNTX concentrations for the four groups of women (all women with at least one uNTX 
measurement) are shown in Figure 1. Our data show ranges of uNTX concentrations of 48-52 
nmol BCE/mmol Cr for premenopausal South Asian women and 48-55 nmol BCE/mmol Cr 
for postmenopausal South Asian women, depending on season. This is in contrast to 40-42 
nmol BCE/mmol Cr in Caucasian premenopausal women, and 62-66 nmol BCE/mmol Cr in 
Caucasian postmenopausal women (Table 1, Figures 1A-D).  Of note, there was no difference 
in uNTX between the premenopausal South Asian women and the postmenopausal South

Asian women in any season of the year (Figure 1B). This is in contrast to premenopausal 
Caucasian women who have lower bone resorption than postmenopausal Caucasian women 
all year around (Figure 1A).  Postmenopausal Asian women had a lower uNTX than 
postmenopausal Caucasian women in autumn only (Figure 1C) and there was no difference in 
uNTX between the two premenopausal groups in any season (Figure 1D).

3.2.2 ANOVA analysis  
A mixed between-within subjects ANOVA, adjusting for BMI and dietary calcium as 
covariates (n=192) showed no significant main effect of season (P=0.16) on uNTX, as well as 
no interaction effect between season and group (P=0.61).  However, there was a significant 
between subjects effect of the four groups (P<0.001) (Figure 2).  Observed power for the 
between-subjects, season effect and season-group interaction were 99.9%, 43.0% and 37.6% 
respectively.  Bonferroni adjusted post hoc tests showed that the only statistically significant 
differences were between the two Caucasian groups (P<0.001) with a non-statistically 
significant trend for a difference between the Caucasian premenopausal and postmenopausal 
Asian groups (P=0.07) and between the two premenopausal groups (P=0.07).

3.2.3 Within-season ANCOVA analysis 
Season-specific ANCOVA, controlling for BMI and dietary calcium as covariates, showed 
that there was a statistically significant overall group difference in uNTX in Summer 
(P<0.001, n=286); Autumn (P<0.001 n=264) Winter (P<0.001, n=235) and Spring (P<0.001, 
n=230).  Bonferroni adjusted post hoc tests showed significant differences between the 
Caucasian premenopausal and Asian postmenopausal groups in summer (P=0.015), winter 
(P=0.05) and spring (P=0.016).  In autumn, winter and spring (P<0.001) there were 
significant differences between the two Caucasian groups. There was a non-statistically 
significant trend for a difference between the Caucasian postmenopausal and Asian 
premenopausal groups in summer (Summer P=0.085) and between the two premenopausal 
groups in autumn (P=0.062). 
 
3.2.4 Premenopausal women paired for exact age  
Paired t-tests, using age-matched pairs, showed that there was no significant difference in 
uNTX between the two premenopausal groups in autumn (P=0.27 n=15 pairs) (Figure 3).  
However, Asians had a significantly higher uNTX in winter by a mean of 16 nmol BCE/mmol 
Cr (P=0.007 n=16 pairs) and in spring by a mean of 20 nmol BCE/mmol Cr (P=0.04, n=15 
pairs), with a non-statistically significant trend for a statistically significantly higher uNTX in 
Asians by a mean of 9 nmol BCE/mmol Cr in Summer (P=0.08 n=25 pairs)(Figure 3).

3.3 Associations between 25(OH)D and uNTX  
Within-season partial correlations (controlling for BMI, ethnicity and menopausal status)

0.08, P=0.23 n=263) Winter (r= -0.10, P=0.14 n=221) or Spring (-0.10, P=0.14 n=219) with a 
weak, non-statistically significant trend for an association in Summer (r= -0.10 P=0.07 
n=322). For ethnic specific estimates (controlling for BMI and reproductive status), there 
were statistically significant correlations in the Asian group in the Summer (r= -0.24, P=0.04, 
n=71) only.  For the postmenopausal South Asians group (controlling for BMI) there were 
statistically significant associations of moderate magnitude in Summer (r= -0.36, P=0.04 
n=33), and a trend for an association in Winter (r= -0.35, P=0.09 n=23), but there were no 
statistically significant results or trends for the other three groups in any season (P>0.05).      
 
3.4 Non-Linear Mixed Modelling  
Table 2 illustrates the regression analysis, including the effect sizes for the main model 
parameters after adjustment for confounders (BMI and ethnic/menopausal group). The 
regression coefficient (SE) for the amplitude/mesor ratio of 25(OH)D was 0.213 (0.015) with 
a  95% confidence interval (0.182, 0.245; P<0.001) and an effect size of 13.4.  Hence the 
amplitude/mesor parameter for 25(OH)D was a significant predictor of uNTX concentration. 
The regression coefficient (SE) for the mesor level of 25(OH)D was -0.035 (0.004) with a 
95% confidence interval of (-0.043, -0.028; P<0.001) and an effect size of 9.1. This indicates 
that the mesor for 25(OH)D was a significant negative predictor of  uNTX concentration.  In 
addition, the effect size for the mesor was smaller than that for the amplitude/mesor ratio.

4.0 Discussion  
 
4.1 Summary of findings 
We found significant differences between the two Caucasian groups in all seasons, with 
postmenopausal Caucasians having a 1.5 fold higher uNTX across the year than did the 
premenopausal Caucasians. However, there was no difference in uNTX between the 
premenopausal and postmenopausal South Asians in any season. Although there was a trend 
for the postmenopausal South Asians to have a lower uNTX than postmenopausal Caucasian 
women, this was only statistically significant in autumn. Therefore, the smaller difference 
seen between the Asian groups compared with the Caucasian groups is not simply due a 
relatively lower uNTX in the older Asians than in the older Caucasians.   Moreover, the 
matched pairs analysis showed a significant difference between the two premenopausal 
groups, with premenopausal Asians 16-20 nmol BCE/mmol Cr higher (in winter and spring) 
once the two groups were exactly age matched.   
 
4.2 Ethnicity, 25(OH)D and bone resorption 
In terms of previous literature, our study findings support those of Lowe et al (2010) who 
found no difference in either the levels of bone resorption [serum c-telopeptide; sCTX] or the 
levels of bone formation [serum procollagen type 1 N propeptide; sP1NP] between UK 
dwelling South Asian and Caucasian postmenopausal women [4].  However, higher bone 
formation [serum BAP concentration] was found in the South Asian women [4].  No 
relationship was found between 25(OH)D status and bone resorption levels in either ethnic 
group [4], which is in agreement with the findings of our current study.  Our results also 
support those of a vitamin D supplementation study which measured bone turnover in New

Zealand dwelling South Asian women and found similar baseline levels of uNTX (and serum 
Osteocalcin [sOCN]) in the premenopausal and postmenopausal groups [6].  This suggests 
similar bone resorption and formation irrespective of menopausal status in South Asian 
women.    
 
It is unclear what the mechanism is behind our finding of higher bone resorption in 
premenopausal South Asians compared with their same-age Caucasian peers.  In 
premenopausal women, inter-individual variation in bone turnover marker concentrations 
have been associated with contraceptive pill use [16, 17], exercise [16], smoking status [16], 
and 25(OH)D concentration [16] in some studies, but not in others [18].  In our n=363 sample 
(n=177 premenopausal), 16% of premenopausal Caucasians reported that they were smokers 
compared with 2% of the premenopausal South Asians, and 9% of premenopausal Caucasians 
vs. only 2% of premenopausal Asians were on the oral contraceptive pill.  This suggests a 
higher presence of smoking and contraceptive pill use in the premenopausal Caucasians. 
However, average minutes of physical activity per day (walking and cycling combined) were 
around 50 mins per day in premenopausal Asians, and around 40 mins per day in 
premenopausal Caucasians (data not shown), so self-reported exercise levels were similar 
between the two ethnic groups, as was BMI.   
 
However, the premenopausal South Asian women in our study were more deficient in 
25(OH)D and had higher parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels than the premenopausal 
Caucasian women throughout the year, (data previously published [9]).   In previous research 
examining premenopausal South Asians residing in Pakistan, secondary hyperparathyroidism

[19]. Still, we found little evidence of a relationship between 25(OH)D status and uNTX 
concentration in either ethnic group in our study, despite 25(OH)D concentrations being 
lower in our premenopausal South Asian women [mean(SD): 30(15) nmol/L] than those of 
Khan et al. (2013)[19]  [mean(SD):  55(54) nmol/L].  
 
It will be important in future research to assess overall levels of bone formation in younger 
and older South Asian women, as it is possible that an increase in bone resorption may be 
coupled with increased bone formation.  In this case, higher bone resorption in these women 
may be less detrimental to bone health than would be the case if bone formation was low.  
High bone formation markers have been seen in South Asian women in comparison with 
Caucasian women in other research studies [4, 5] as well as similar levels of bone formation 
markers between postmenopausal and premenopausal South Asian women [6]. Moreover, it is 
not clear as to whether our findings of increased bone resorption in premenopausal South 
Asian women show pathology or physiology.   
 
4.3 Predictive ability of 25(OH)D seasonal change and yearly average in explaining bone 
resorption 
We found that seasonal change in 25(OH)D was a positive predictor of uNTX, supporting our 
original hypothesis of a positive association between seasonal fluctuation in 25(OH)D and 
bone resorption levels.  This result indicates that those individuals with a higher seasonal 
change in 25(OH)D have a higher uNTX, which suggests increased bone resorption. It also 
supports the hypothesis that a larger degree of seasonal changes in 25(OH)D might lead to a 
health detriment for some outcomes [20]. As found in our smaller scale previous work with 
the bone marker sCTX [15], in the current study average concentration of 25(OH)D  had a 
smaller effect size than did seasonal fluctuation in explaining uNTX.  This study supports that

reported previously [15] which suggests that seasonal variation in 25(OH)D concentration is 
at least as important as average yearly concentration of 25(OH)D, perhaps even more so.  
However it contradicts previous research in postmenopausal Caucasian women, a Scottish 
study found no association between degree of seasonal change in 25(OH)D and bone 
resorption levels [uCTX] [13].  Also, an Irish intervention study of young adults found no 
effect of wintertime supplementation (15 micrograms per day; 22 weeks) of vitamin D on 
subsequent bone turnover [14], suggesting that supressing the winter-time reduction in 
25(OH)D status did not benefit bone health, at least in the short term.    
 
4.4 Implications of this work 
Our findings highlight that in addition to having a slender bone size, premenopausal South 
Asian women have also higher bone resorption than would be expected for their age.   Further 
research is urgently required to fully elucidate the reason for this increased bone resorption, 
and to assess whether bone formation is also increased, or not, in premenopausal South Asian 
women.  The clinical implications of this work are that South Asian women may need to be 
targeted for bone health relevant interventions at a much younger age.  Also, reference ranges 
for bone markers may need to take account of differing ethnic backgrounds.   In addition, the 
long-term effects of seasonal fluctuation in vitamin D status now need to be assessed, in order 
to determine whether there are longer term effects on bone health, including effects on bone 
structure and clinical end points such as fracture risk.  If a relevant long-term effect is seen, 
then the clinical implications are that that it might be of benefit to only take vitamin D 
supplements in the wintertime, not all year around, thus ensuring a  blunting of the amount of 
seasonal change in 25(OH)D.

4.5 Strengths and Limitations 
Our study adds significantly to the previous literature, as it is the first study to assess 
differences in bone resorption between premenopausal Caucasians and premenopausal South 
Asians, as well as the first to assess the relationship between 25(OH)D status and bone 
resorption in premenopausal South Asian women. Thus, it is the first to report that 
premenopausal South Asians have significantly higher bone resorption levels in winter and 
spring than do same-age Caucasian women, and that there is no significant relationship 
between 25(OH)D status and bone resorption in premenopausal South Asian women.  
Nonetheless, it must be borne in mind that these data came from only Caucasian and South 
Asian women, and may not be applicable to other ethnic groups, due to potential ethnic 
differences in vitamin D metabolism (e.g genetics affecting activity of vitamin D hydroxylase 
enzymes or vitamin D binding protein activity [21, 22]).  It is important to note that the 
sample size was very small for the South Asian groups in some of the analyses, particularly 
for the premenopausal women.  This was due to few of the group having full data for all 
seasons (e.g. many had at least one season missing, prohibiting entry into the ANOVA and 
the non-linear mixed modelling).  Also, there is a clear need for the concurrent measurement 
of a bone formation marker to assess overall bone turnover, as high bone resorption in the 
premenopausal South Asian women would not necessarily be detrimental to bone health if 
coupled with high bone formation.

5.0 Conclusions  
 
Our results add to that of previous studies of bone markers in South Asian women by 
introducing a longitudinal perspective over the course of the year and is the first study to our 
knowledge to examine bone changes in this ethnic group in this way.  We have shown that 
premenopausal South Asian women do not differ from postmenopausal South Asian women 
in bone resorption levels in any season of the year. This is in contrast to premenopausal 
Caucasian women who have lower bone resorption than postmenopausal Caucasian women 
all year around, reaching a statistically significant difference in autumn and winter. The 
increased bone resorption observed in the premenopausal South Asian women, relative to 
their same age Caucasian counterparts, warrants further investigation.  This is because if 
increased bone resorption is not offset by increased bone formation, it may lead to a detriment 
to bone health.   
 
In addition, this work has been the first to show (in a large sample size) that seasonal 
fluctuation in vitamin D status is associated with bone resorption markers in UK dwelling 
premenopausal and postmenopausal women.  The level of 25(OH)D corresponding to 
sufficiency and prevention of chronic disease has been long debated in scientific literature but 
is currently set at 50nmol/L in the US/Canada [23].  Our findings are of importance as they 
suggest that 25(OH)D may also need to be stable over the course of the year, and that stability 
of vitamin D levels may be as important as actual average concentration of vitamin D.    
Further research is now required to assess the levels of bone formation in South Asian women 
and whether bone formation levels vary by degree of seasonal fluctuation of 25(OH)D.
