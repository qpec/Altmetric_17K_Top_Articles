ABSTRACT
Background: Prebiotics have been shown to improve satiety in
adults with overweight and obesity; however, studies in children
are limited.
Objective: We examined the effects of prebiotic supplementation
on appetite control and energy intake in children with overweight
and obesity.
Design: This study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-
controlled trial. Forty-two boys and girls, ages 7–12 y, with a body
mass index (BMI) of $85th percentile were randomly assigned to
8 g oligofructose-enriched inulin/d or placebo (maltodextrin) for
16 wk. Objective measures of appetite included energy intake at
an ad libitum breakfast buffet, 3-d food records, and fasting satiety
hormone concentrations. Subjective appetite ratings were obtained
from visual analog scales before and after the breakfast. Children’s
Eating Behavior Questionnaires were also completed by caregivers.
Results: Compared with placebo, prebiotic intake resulted in sig-
nificantly higher feelings of fullness (P = 0.04) and lower pro-
spective food consumption (P = 0.03) at the breakfast buffet at
16 wk compared with baseline. Compared with placebo, prebiotic
supplementation significantly reduced energy intake at the week
16 breakfast buffet in 11- and 12-y-olds (P = 0.04) but not in 7- to
10-y-olds. Fasting adiponectin (P = 0.04) and ghrelin (P = 0.03)
increased at 16 wk with the prebiotic compared with placebo. In
intent-to-treat analysis, there was a trend for prebiotic supplemen-
tation to reduce BMI z score to a greater extent than placebo
(23.4%; P = 0.09) and a significant 23.8% reduction in per-
protocol analysis (P = 0.043).
Conclusions: Independent of other lifestyle changes, prebiotic sup-
plementation in children with overweight and obesity improved sub-
jective appetite ratings. This translated into reduced energy intake in a
breakfast buffet in older but not in younger children. This simple
dietary change has the potential to help with appetite regulation in
children with obesity. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as
NCT02125955.

INTRODUCTION
More than one-third of US and Canadian children are overweight
or obese (1, 2). The current obesogenic environment, which includes
readily available, highly palatable foods that are low in dietary fiber,
is one factor contributing to the increase in childhood obesity (3, 4).
Despite the increase in childhood obesity throughout the world,
body composition varies greatly within populations, even within
families who share similar environments and lifestyles (4). In-
trapopulation variability in adiposity suggests that there are
individual-level traits that may increase a child’s risk of developing
obesity. Appetitive traits, including low satiety responsiveness and
high food responsiveness, may be important individual-level traits that
cause a child to overeat or to eat in the absence of hunger, thereby
contributing to chronic energy imbalance and weight gain (4, 5).
Adolescent obesity is predictive of adulthood obesity and
achieving a healthy body weight and lifestyle in childhood must
therefore be a leading priority for strategies aimed at reducing
obesity. Typical nutrition-based treatments for the management
of adulthood obesity often include restrictive diets that reduce
energy intake and/or dramatically alter macronutrient intake;
however, these approaches are less effective in children and may
promote weight gain via binge eating, increased desire for re-
stricted foods, and heightened consumption of “snacks” throughout
the day (6–8). Alternatively, focusing on the addition of certain
foods and nutrients that are known to reduce the risk of obesity,
such as dietary fiber, represents a potentially more suitable
management option in the pediatric population (9–11). Impor-
tantly, more comprehensive multidisciplinary and family-based
interventions that include dietary changes have shown success
in reducing BMI z scores in children (12).
Increasing dietary fiber intake by using a specific type of fiber
called prebiotics may stimulate satiety hormones and enhance

 appetite control, thereby helping to manage body weight (13, 14).
Health benefits of prebiotics are most often attributed to their
ability to stimulate the growth and activity of health-promoting
bacteria in the gut while simultaneously improving appetite and
postprandial glucose and insulin concentrations (10–21 g pre-
biotic/d) (15, 16). Prebiotics have been shown to decrease food
intake and reduce body fat in overweight and obese adults (13).
To date, to our knowledge, only 2 published studies have exam-
ined the effects of prebiotics on body weight in children: a study
in which the prebiotic was combined with increased calcium in-
take and the primary outcome was change in bone mineral density
in healthy normal-weight adolescents (17) and a trial by Liber and
Szajewska (18) in which the primary outcome was body weight
changes in children with overweight and obesity after 12 wk of
prebiotic intake. However, beyond a self-reported 3-d food record
in the study by Liber and Szajewska (18), there is a lack of
knowledge on the effects of prebiotics on appetite regulation in
children. Therefore, our objective was to assess the effects of
16 wk of prebiotic supplementation on subjective and objective
measures of appetite control as well as BMI z score in children
with overweight and obesity.
METHODS
Informed consent
This project received ethical approval from the Conjoint Health
Research Ethics Board of the University of Calgary (ethics ID:
REB13-0975), and the study was registered at clinicaltrials.gov
(NCT02125955).
Participants
A total of 42 male and female participants with overweight or
obesity (BMI $85th percentile) between the ages of 7 and 12 y
were voluntarily recruited in 2014–2015 from the city of
Calgary, Canada, to participate in this randomized, double-
blind, placebo-controlled trial. This study was part of a
larger clinical trial that assessed multiple outcomes (19).The
primary outcome of this particular study was the effect of
prebiotics on appetite (serum satiety hormones, appetite rat-
ings, and food intake) and, secondarily, BMI z score. Based on
the outcomes of the entire trial, sample size was calculated for
percentage body fat and BMI z score on the basis of data from
studies that examined the effects of lifestyle intervention (diet
and exercise) in children with overweight and obesity. Spe-
cifically, with an estimated reduction in BMI z score of 0.26
and an SD of 0.22 based on a power of 0.8 to detect a significant
difference (P = 0.05, 2-sided), a minimum of 24 participants
(n = 12/group) were needed (20). With an estimated difference
in percentage body fat of 6% and an SD of 6.26 based on a
power of 0.8 to detect a significant difference (P = 0.05, 2-sided),
a minimum of 36 participants (n = 18/group) were needed (21);
8 additional participants (4/group) were added to account for
dropouts. We were also adequately powered to detect differ-
ences in serum ghrelin on the basis of the diet and exercise
interventions of Kelishadi et al. (22).
Participants were randomly assigned to the prebiotic or placebo
group by using a computer-generated randomization list that was
formulated to stratify by age, sex, and BMI percentile. The
randomization sequence was generated by an investigator not
involved in recruiting participants, and a research assistant was
responsible for product distribution to ensure the correct
product was provided to the groups. Randomization sequences
were not revealed to the study staff. Participants and study staff
were blinded to the treatments, which were provided to the
participants
in
identical
individual-serving
foil
packets.
Overweight and obese boys and girls, ages 7–12 y, with BMIs
$85th percentile for their age and sex, were eligible to par-
ticipate in this study. Given that puberty has been shown to
affect fat mass, digestion, and energy storage and expenditure,
pubertal stage was assessed before study participation (23,
24). Participants were required to be at Tanner development
stage #3, as determined by a pediatrician from the Alberta
Children’s Hospital during a brief confidential physical ex-
amination after confirmation of the caregivers’ consent. Girls
were required to be premenarchal. Participants were excluded
if they had used prebiotic or probiotic supplements or had
been administered antibiotics within 3 mo of entering the
study; had type 1 or type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular health
conditions, or liver diseases; had previous gastrointestinal
surgery; were taking drugs that influenced appetite, weight,
and/or
metabolism,
including
herbal
supplements;
were
following a diet designed for weight loss at the time of study
commencement; or had undergone a weight change of .3 kg
within 3 mo of study commencement. Last, participants who
were unable to provide caregiver consent were excluded from
the study.
Dietary intervention
Participants were randomly assigned to consume either 8 g
prebiotic/d (oligofructose-enriched inulin; Synergy 1; Beneo)
or an equicaloric dose of a 3.3-g maltodextrin placebo/d
(Agenamalt 20.222; Agrana) for 16 wk. Maltodextrin was se-
lected as a placebo due to its physical and chemical properties,
which gave it a similar taste and appearance, and its successful
use as a placebo in previous prebiotic supplementation trial in
adults with overweight and obesity (13) and a similar study
examining the impact of oligofructose supplementation on satiety
in normal-weight adults (25). The prebiotic fiber and placebo
were supplied to the participants in individualized identical foil
packets. The prebiotic packet contained the entire dose of 8 g
oligofructose-enriched inulin and the placebo packet contained the
entire dose of 3.3 g maltodextrin. Therefore, participants in both
groups were required to consume 1 packet/d. Both groups were
instructed to add the powder from 1 packet to 250 mL water and
consume the entire mixture w15–30 min before their dinner meal.
Participants were provided with a reusable water bottle on their
initial test day to allow for consistent measurement throughout the
study and across the study groups. The dose of prebiotic and pla-
cebo was increased over a period of 2 wk to allow for adaptation to
the fiber and to minimize gastrointestinal symptoms (flatulence and
bloating). For the first 2 wk, each participant was instructed to mix
1 packet into 250 mL water but only drink half of the mixture and
therefore consume half of the daily dose. For the remaining 14 wk,
participants were asked to consume the entire water bottle con-
taining the complete daily dose of prebiotic fiber or maltodextrin.
Participants were asked to return all used (empty) and unused (full)
packets to assess for compliance.

 Maintenance of dietary habits and physical activity
The goal of this study was to analyze the effects of the prebiotic
supplementation independent of any other lifestyle changes such
as diet or exercise. Thus, participants purchased and prepared their
own meals throughout the study with no influence from the
research team. Individuals were instructed to eat until com-
fortably full and maintain their usual level of physical activity.
Caregivers recorded their child’s physical activity by using the
Godin’s Leisure-Time Exercise Questionnaire at baseline and
at 8 and 16 wk (26).
Food intake
Food and beverage intakes were assessed with the use of 3-d
weighed food records. Caregivers were provided with a food scale
and instructed to weigh and record all foods and beverages con-
sumed by their child for 2 weekdays and 1 weekend day at baseline
and at 8 and 16 wk. This information was analyzed with the use of
the Food Works software program (The Nutrition Company).
Ad libitum breakfast buffet
Participants’ energy intake was determined at an ad libitum
breakfast buffet that took place at baseline and again at the end
of the study (week 16). Participants were offered breakfast foods
in reasonable surplus amounts to eliminate researcher-imposed
limits to voluntary food intake. The energy content of food
choices was predetermined. Participants were advised to eat until
comfortably full. After participants consumed all they wished to,
research staff measured the total weight of the remaining food not
consumed and used this information to calculate energy intake.
Blood sampling
A registered nurse from the Alberta Children’s Hospital collected
w8 mL fasted blood from each participant at baseline and at the
end of the study (week 16). To obtain the serum for satiety hor-
mone analysis, blood samples were collected in cooled microfuge
tubes containing Diprotin A (0.034 mg/mL blood; MP Biomedicals),
Sigma protease inhibitor (1 mg/mL blood; Sigma-Aldrich), and
Pefabloc (1 mg/mL blood; Roche). Serum was stored at 2808C
until analyzed for gut hormones, adipokines, and insulin.
Serum analysis: gut hormones, adipokines, and insulin
Serum samples were analyzed in duplicate for gut hormones
involved in appetite control, including active glucagon-like peptide 1
(GLP-1),6 total peptide tyrosine tyrosine (PYY), active ghrelin,
and total glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP)
along with leptin and insulin with the use of the Milliplex Map
Human Metabolic Hormone Magnetic Bead Panel–Metabolic
Multiplex Assay (Millipore; see Supplemental Methods for de-
tails). Serum was also analyzed for the adipokines, adiponectin,
and resistin by using the Milliplex Map Human Adipokine
Magnetic Bead Panel 1–Endocrine Multiplex Assay kit. Eve
Technologies Corporation performed the plate analysis with the
use of Luminex 200 instrumentation and software.
Visual analog scale
Subjective sensations of appetite were determined by using a
100-mm visual analog scale (VAS) at baseline and at the end of
study immediately before and after the ad libitum breakfast
buffet according to our previous work (27). The “Before
Breakfast” and “After Breakfast” VAS consisted of 5 and 6
questions, respectively. Questions range from “How hungry do
you feel?” to “How full do you feel?” and were anchored by “I
am not hungry at all” or “Not at all full” and “I have never been
more hungry” or “totally full.”
Children’s Eating Behavior Questionnaire
Subjective appetite and eating behaviors were also assessed by
using the Children’s Eating Behavior Questionnaire (CEBQ)
(28), which was completed at baseline and at 8 and 16 wk.
Caregivers were asked to complete the questionnaire with their
child’s input. This 35-item questionnaire was designed to assess
eating behavior styles that are related to obesity risk and is di-
vided into 8 subscales: Satiety Responsiveness, Food Re-
sponsiveness, Enjoyment of Food, Emotional Overeating, Emotional
Undereating, Desire to Drink, Slowness in Eating, and Food
Fussiness.
BMI z score
BMI z score, also known as the BMI SD score, is a measure
of relative weight and height adjusted for age and sex applied
to a reference standard. These scores are considered to be more
appropriate for determining longitudinal changes in body weight
and adiposity while also being a superior measure for comparing
between-group mean values (29). Thus, BMI z score was used to
assess body weight changes in participants. The Children’s
Hospital of Philadelphia Pediatric z score calculator, which uses
CDC growth charts, was used to calculate BMI z score (http://
stokes.chop.edu/web/zscore/).
Statistical analyses
Data are presented as means 6 SEMs. The primary statistical
analyses were performed on an intent-to-treat (ITT) basis, re-
gardless of compliance, in which missing values were imputed
via the means of the last observation carried forward. Data were
analyzed with SPSS 20.0 software for Windows (IBM Corpo-
ration). Differences between groups at baseline were determined
by using independent t tests for continuous variables and chi-
square tests for categorical variables. Changes from baseline in
subjective and objective measures of appetite were determined
by subtracting initial values from the final values, except in the
case of 3-d dietary food records and CEBQ scores. Analysis of
change in ad libitum breakfast buffet energy intake, gut hor-
mones, adipokines, insulin, and VAS score was carried out by
using ANCOVA, with age and sex included as covariates.
CEBQs and 3-d weighed food records were analyzed by using
repeated-measures ANCOVA, with age and sex included as
covariates. Baseline scores were also used as a covariate when

 they were determined to be significantly different between
groups and were incorporated into the model. Change in BMI
z score from baseline was calculated by subtracting the initial
values from the final values and analyzed with the use of
ANCOVA, with age and sex included as covariates. Both ITT and
per-protocol analyses of children who completed the study were
completed for BMI z score. Physical activity was analyzed by
using repeated-measures ANOVA.
RESULTS
Participants
Forty-two participants provided signed consent to participate
in the study and were randomly assigned to either the prebiotic or
placebo group (Figure 1). A total of 38 participants completed
the study, 20 in the prebiotic group (10 girls and 10 boys) and 18
in the placebo group (7 girls and 11 boys). There were no sig-
nificant differences between groups at baseline in terms of sex,
height, weight, and BMI z score (Table 1). The retention rate
was 90%. One of the participants did not attend baseline testing
and did not participate in the study. Three additional participants
dropped out (2 from the prebiotic group and 1 from the placebo
group) over the course of the study. Reasons for withdrawing
from the study included personal matters (time commitment
issues) and others not specified. When an informal interview
was conducted at the end of the study to assess blinding, 50%
and 72% of the prebiotic and placebo participants, respectively,
correctly guessed their group assignment.
Food intake
On the basis of the weighed 3-d food records, both the prebiotic
and placebo groups reported lower energy intake (kilocalories per
day) at 8 and 16 wk with a significant effect of time (P = 0.047)
but not treatment (P = 0.12) or time 3 treatment interaction
(P = 0.92) (Table 2). Repeated-measures ANCOVA, with sex and
age as covariates, indicated that there were no significant time 3
treatment interaction effects for macro- and micronutrient intakes
(P . 0.05 for all), but there was a main effect of treatment for
protein (P = 0.048), calcium (P = 0.032), and sodium (P = 0.042),
which was reflected in higher baseline intake in placebo com-
pared with prebiotic participants.

 Ad libitum breakfast buffet
There was no significant effect of treatment on energy con-
sumed at the ad libitum breakfast buffet when all ages were
included in the analysis (all ages, 7–12 y old; n = 40; P = 0.18)
(Table 3). There was, however, a significant effect of treatment
3 age (P = 0.017) on energy intake at the breakfast buffet;
therefore, participants were stratified into a younger (7–10 y;
n = 22) age group and an older (11–12 y; n = 18) age group.
Prebiotic intake significantly reduced energy intake in older
participants at the final breakfast buffet compared with placebo
(P = 0.04). Energy intake in the prebiotic group was reduced by
w113 kcal, whereas energy intake increased by 137 kcal in the
placebo group. In the younger participants, energy intake in-
creased in both groups at the final breakfast buffet compared
with baseline. The magnitude of increased energy intake in the
placebo group (188 kcal) was higher than in the prebiotic group
(60 kcal), but this was not significantly different (P . 0.05).
Gut hormones, insulin, and adipokines
There was a significant increase in fasting ghrelin with pre-
biotic supplementation compared with placebo (P = 0.04) (Table
4). The prebiotic group’s ghrelin concentrations increased by
nearly 28% from baseline, whereas the placebo group showed an
increase of w8% from the start of the study. There were no
significant differences in changes in fasting GIP, GLP-1, PYY,
and insulin concentrations from baseline to the final test days
(P . 0.05).
There was a significant change from baseline for adiponectin
(P = 0.005), with the prebiotic group showing increased con-
centrations and the placebo group showing a decrease over the
16-wk intervention. There were no differences in fasting resistin
or leptin between groups.
Subjective ratings of appetite: VAS
Differences in subjective appetite ratings were measured by
using VASs before and after an ad libitum breakfast buffet at
baseline and at the end of the study. “Pre” refers to appetite
ratings before breakfast meal consumption and “post” refers to
appetite ratings after breakfast meal consumption.
From week 0 to week 16, the prebiotic reduced the amount of
food that participants thought they could consume at the breakfast
buffet (P = 0.03), which is shown in Figure 2A as prospective
food consumption before breakfast. The lower ratings of prospective
food consumption seen after consumption of the final breakfast
meal did not differ between groups (P . 0.05) (Figure 2B). There
was no difference in fullness before breakfast (Figure 2C), but
participants reported feeling significantly “more full” after their
breakfast meal at week 16 in the prebiotic compared with the
placebo group than after their breakfast meal consumed at week
0 (P = 0.04) (Figure 2D). The ratings of pre– and post–breakfast
buffet hunger did not differ between the prebiotic and placebo
groups (P . 0.05) (Figure 2E, F).
CEBQ
The subscales of Enjoyment of Food, Emotional Over-
eating, Desire to Drink, Emotional Undereating, Food Re-
sponsiveness, Slowness in Eating, and Food Fussiness were
similar between groups at baseline and at 16 wk (Table 5). In

 contrast, there was a significant increase in the Satiety Re-
sponsiveness subscale in both groups over time (effect of
time, P = 0.007). Specifically, caregivers reported significant
increases in Satiety Responsiveness from baseline and mid-
point to the end of the study (P = 0.001 and P = 0.04,
respectively).
BMI z score
In ITT analysis, there was a trend (P = 0.09) for the prebiotic
to reduce the BMI z score by 3.4% (20.066 6 0.026) compared
with a 0.49% (20.009 6 0.019) reduction for the placebo. In
per-protocol analysis, the 3.8% (20.078 6 0.027) reduction
by the prebiotic was significant compared with the 0.35%
(20.007 6 0.020) reduction with the placebo (per-protocol
analysis, P = 0.043).
Physical activity
According to the Godin’s Leisure-Time Exercise Question-
naire, there was no significant change in exercise frequency and
duration between the 2 groups (P . 0.05).
Compliance and tolerance
We observed a mean return rate of 87% 6 0.03% and 91%
6 0.03% of total allotted packets for the prebiotic and pla-
cebo groups, respectively. Two participants who dropped out
forgot to bring their packets to their 4-wk anthropometrics
appointment and a short time later withdrew from the study
entirely. Therefore, compliance data were collected from 39
participants. Compliance was calculated by using an equa-
tion in which the total number of returned empty packets was
divided by the expected number of packets (i.e., the total
number of packets that would have been consumed if par-
ticipants were 100% compliant with the treatment). In-
dependent t tests indicated that there were no significant
differences in compliance with the powder between groups
(P = 0.30).
With regard to gastrointestinal side effects, 70% and 61% of
participants in the prebiotic and placebo groups, respectively,
reported no changes in flatulence and bloating during the study.
Similar numbers of participants in the prebiotic (25%) and
placebo (28%) groups experienced a mild increase in flatulence
and bloating. The remaining 5% and 11% of participants in the
prebiotic and placebo groups, respectively, reported a moderate
increase in flatulence and bloating. None of the participants
belonging to either group reported a severe increase in flatulence
and bloating. Finally, 61% of participants indicated that the
powder was very acceptable in terms of consuming it on a day-
to-day basis, whereas the remaining 39% rated the powder as
moderately acceptable.

 DISCUSSION
Studies in rodents and adult humans have shown that prebiotics,
chiefly oligofructose and inulin, result in enhanced satiety, reduced
energy intake, and weight loss (13, 25, 30–32); however, studies in
the obese pediatric population are limited. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first randomized, double-blind, placebo-
controlled trial to specifically examine appetite control in children
with overweight and obesity in response to long-term prebiotic in-
take. Our findings suggest that prebiotics may help improve appetite
control in the context of pediatric obesity.
Improvements in subjective appetite included lower prospective
food consumption and increased fullness after 16 wk of oligo-
fructose-enriched inulin. Cani et al. (25) showed that healthy adults
who consumed oligofructose for 2 wk reported increased fullness
and reduced prospective food consumption after the dinner meal
but not after breakfast, as was seen in our children. These meal-
related differences may be attributed to the timing of prebiotic
intake given that participants in Cani et al. (25) consumed 4 g with
breakfast and 4 g with dinner, whereas our children consumed the
full 8-g dose just before their dinner meal. Thus, the beneficial
effects of prebiotics on appetite may not be acutely evident but
rather may contribute to a state of prolonged satiety, wherein the
prebiotic effect leads to delayed initiation of subsequent meals and
reduced subsequent meal size. This phenomenon of delayed action
has been described by others as the second-meal effect. Specifically,
whole grain–rye foods, when consumed at an evening meal, sig-
nificantly reduced energy intake at a lunch meal the following day
and this may have been due to mechanisms related to colonic fer-
mentation (33). Inulin, when used as a fat-replacer in a breakfast
sausage, was also shown to reduce total energy intake at the end of a
test day in healthy men, despite no apparent effect on satiety during
breakfast itself (34). Complete colonic fermentation of the inulin
may be followed by a late postabsorptive satiety trigger (34).
In contrast to VAS scores, CEBQ results changed in a similar
manner between groups, which suggests a possible “training
effect” among caregivers. Formally known as the Hawthorne
effect (35), participants’ awareness that their child’s eating be-
havior is being observed can lead to reported changes in eating
behavior that align with researchers’ expectations or desires
(36). This effect has been noted in other studies that examined
behavior in a similar demographic (36).
Past studies have shown that prebiotic intake can lead to re-
duced energy intake in healthy and overweight and obese adults
(13, 25, 37). Similar to these findings, overweight and obese

 children in the prebiotic group consumed less energy than those
in the placebo group at the final ad libitum breakfast buffet, but
this was only significant in the older children: the 11- and 12-y-
olds in the prebiotic group reduced meal energy intake by
113 kcal compared with an increase of 137 kcal in the placebo
group. A reduction in this objective measure of energy intake
could be attributed to the beneficial changes in prospective food
consumption and fullness experienced. The physiologic mech-
anisms by which prebiotics improve satiety and regulate appetite
are likely mediated in part by hormones that control appetite,
such as GLP-1, PYY, ghrelin, and leptin (13, 31, 38). Short-chain
fatty acids (SCFAs), metabolites of gut microbial fermentation of
prebiotics, bind to specific receptors [free–fatty acid receptor
(FFAR) 2] on colonic L-cells and trigger the secretion of GLP-1
and PYY (39). Our results that showed increased fasting ghrelin
and no changes in GLP-1 and PYY are surprising in light of
studies in adults that showed increased GLP-1 and PYY and
reduced ghrelin after prebiotic intake (13, 38). The observed
increase in fasting ghrelin does align with the concept that diet-
induced weight loss and caloric restriction tend to increase
ghrelin in obese subjects as a defense mechanism (40, 41).
However, our findings are limited to the fasted state and are in
fact consistent with previous studies that showed no differences
in fasting concentrations of GLP-1 and PYY in adults who
consumed 21 g oligofructose/d for 12 wk (13). The significant
reductions in ghrelin and increases in PYY that occurred in the
adult study were seen during a meal tolerance test, which takes
into account the responsiveness of these hormones to nutrient
stimulus. A full postprandial survey of gut hormones in obese
children would be needed to provide a comprehensive under-
standing of the role of these hormones in appetite control in this
population. In addition to stimulating satiety hormones, studies in
mice also showed that the SCFA acetate may suppress appetite by
crossing the blood-brain barrier and acting directly on central ho-
meostatic mechanisms, therefore potentially triggering a reduction
in food and energy intake (42). Other mechanisms by which the gut
microbiota may influence host appetite control have recently been
reviewed by Fetissov (43).
In the current study, we found that oligofructose-enriched inulin
significantly increased fasting adiponectin. A cross-sectional study
in nondiabetic women showed that increased fiber intake and a
reduced starch-to-fiber ratio were positively associated with adi-
ponectin (44). Higher fiber intake could increase adiponectin due
to increased SCFA production, given that physiologic concen-
trations of SCFAs can activate FFAR3 on adipocytes in mice and
stimulate the release of another adipocyte-derived hormone, leptin
(45). However, such studies have yet to show a positive effect of
SCFAs on adiponectin secretion. For instance, Freeland and
Wolever (46) examined whether the route of administration (in-
travenous compared with rectal infusion) of the SCFA acetate
would affect the secretion of multiple gut hormones and adipo-
kines, including adiponectin in 6 hyperinsulinemic women. There

 was no effect of acetate, regardless of route of administration, on
adiponectin (46). In addition to this particular study, there are few
studies that looked at the role of SCFAs on adiponectin release, and
therefore the mechanism by which prebiotics affect adiponectin is
not known and may in fact be SCFA-independent.
Although ITT analysis did not show a significant reduction in
BMI z score in our participants (P = 0.09), per-protocol analysis
of participants who completed the study was significant (P = 0.043).
The reduction in BMI z score of 0.078 over 4 mo is comparable
to other, more intensive interventions, such as a nutrition ed-
ucation plus physical activity intervention in obese children in
which a reduction of 0.13 in BMI z score occurred at 6 mo
and a final reduction of 0.18 in BMI z score at 1 y was observed
(47). It remains to be seen if extending the duration of our
prebiotic intervention would continue to reduce BMI z score
over time.
The strengths of this study include a sufficiently large sample
size of both sexes across a fairly wide age range and the ex-
amination of a variety of subjective and objective measures of
appetite. The limitations of using parent-reported 3-d food re-
cords to measure energy intake are recognized (48), and our
initial training session attempted to minimize reporting error.
Fasting blood samples precluded the examination of postprandial
effects on satiety hormones, and energy intake during the buffet
was only significantly different in separate age group analysis.
Participants in our study were primarily white and of middle to
high socioeconomic status, thus limiting generalizability to more
diverse populations. Last, future studies should include children
with comorbid conditions, because our participants were oth-
erwise healthy overweight and obese children.
In conclusion, the results of this dietary intervention study
highlight the potential of prebiotic supplementation in the
management of pediatric overweight and obesity, with significant
improvements in sensations of appetite and marked reductions in
energy intake in children 11–12 y of age. Additional studies are
required to examine postprandial satiety hormone concentra-
tions after a test meal to develop a better understanding of how
prebiotics induce physiologic effects on appetite regulation in
overweight and obese children.
