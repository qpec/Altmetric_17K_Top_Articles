Patients with breast cancer (BCa) frequently have preexisting vitamin D deficiency (low serum 25-
hydroxyvitamin D) when their cancer develops. A number of epidemiological studies show an inverse
associationbetweenBCariskandvitaminDstatusinhumans,althoughsomestudieshavefailedtofind
an association. In addition, several studies have reported that BCa patients with vitamin D deficiency

vitamin D signaling inhibits the expression of the tumor progression gene Id1, and this pathway is
abrogated in vitamin D deficiency in vivo in 2 murine models of BCa. These findings are relevant to
humans, because we discovered that the mechanism of VDR regulation of Inhibitor of differentiation
1 (ID1) is conserved in human BCa cells, and there is a negative correlation between serum 25-hy-
droxyvitamin D levels and the level of ID1 in primary tumors from patients with BCa. (Endocrinology

itamin D, derived from diet or sunlight driven syn-
thesis in the skin, is converted by the liver to 25-hy-
droxyvitamin D (25(OH)D), the circulating form of the hor-
mone. 25(OH)D is subsequently converted to 1�,25-
dihydroxyvitamin D3 (calcitriol) primarily in the kidney but
also in many target tissues, including breast cancer (BCa)
cells(1).Calcitriolistheactivehormone,bindstothevitamin
D receptor (VDR), a member of the nuclear receptor family,
and regulates gene transcription by binding to vitamin D-re-
sponse elements in target genes (1–3).
A number of epidemiological studies (but not all) (4) in-
dicate that there is an inverse correlation between the risk of
developingBCaandserum25(OH)Dlevelsinhumans(5–7).
Further, biological studies suggest that pharmacologic levels
of calcitriol inhibit cancer growth, particularly in tissue cul-
ture models (1, 8). However, treatment with high-dose vita-
min D likely has pharmacological effects that are distinct
from the pathophysiology of vitamin D deficiency.
Provocatively, low vitamin D levels are associated with
worseprognosticindicatorsandoutcomesinpatientswith
BCa (9–11). Because vitamin D deficiency is common in
patients diagnosed with BCa (1, 10, 12–14), elucidating
the cause of the association between poor outcomes and
vitamin D deficiency promises to have a significant impact
on improving care for patients with BCa, including en-
abling the development of novel therapeutic approaches.

 ciency on the critical step in tumor progression from non-
metastatic to metastatic is unknown. Finally, whether the
mechanisms by which vitamin D deficiency and VDR sig-
naling modulates BCa growth and metastasis are systemic
or tumor autonomous is also unclear. Therefore, in this
study, we tested the impact of vitamin D deficiency on BCa
growth and investigated the tumor autonomous effect of
VDR signaling on BCa progression and metastasis.
Materials and Methods
Study approvals
All animal studies were approved by the Stanford Institu-
tional Animal Use and Use Committee.
All clinical samples were obtained in accordance with a Stan-
ford Institutional Review Board approved protocol, which in-
cluded informed consent.
Mice
Five to 6-week-old female wild-type BALB/c mice were pur-
chased from The Jackson Laboratory. AIN76 diets containing
500-IU vitamin D/kg were used as standard diets and compared
with vitamin D-deficient diets which had 25-IU/kg diet. All diets
wereobtainedfromResearchDiets,Inc.Tumorswereinoculated
into the left inguinal mammary fat pad using 1 � 105 cells sus-
pended50:50matrigel(ThermoFisher)andPBS.Bioluminescent
imaging (BLI) was performed once a week using the IVIS 200
(Caliper) imaging system at the Stanford Small Animal Imaging
Facility as described (18, 19). Tumor volume was estimated by
measuring 2 tumor diameters using a vernier calipers. Lungs,
liver, and spleen were subjected to ex vivo BLI to map metastatic
lesions and histopathological confirmation.
Measurement of 25(OH)D
Mouse serum 25(OH)D levels were measured as described
(20). Human serum 25(OH)D levels were measured by mass
spectroscopy in the Stanford Clinical Laboratories.
Generation of stable Vdr knockdown (KD) and
Rescue cell lines
Short hairpin RNAs directed against mouse Vdr (Sigma-Al-
drich) or control vector were stably transfected into 168FARN-
luc cells (a gift from Fred Miller, Wayne State University) and
selected for puromycin resistance clonal selection from a single
cell. The cells were then transfected with a VDR expression plas-
mid or empty vector (pEF6; Thermo Fisher) control and selected
with puromycin and blasticidin.
Statistical analyses
Student’s t test was computed to determine statistically sig-
nificant differences between 2 groups. For comparisons between
more than 2 groups, ANOVA was performed followed by
Tukey’s post hoc test. Spearman’s test was performed to com-
pute correlation analysis. P � .05 was considered statistically
significant. GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software, Inc) was used
to perform statistical calculations and for plotting graphs.

Results and Discussion
Diet-induced vitamin D deficiency promotes BCa
growth in vivo
To understand the impact of systemic vitamin D defi-
ciency on BCa progression, we generated a mouse model
of vitamin D deficiency by placing wild-type mice on a
standardchowdiet(control,500-IUvitaminD3/kgdiet)or
on a low vitamin D diet (LD25, 25 IU/kg) for 10 weeks.
Ingestion of the LD25 diet caused a statistically significant
decrease in serum 25(OH)D levels compared with control
mice (Supplemental Figure 1). We orthotopically seeded
the vitamin D-deficient and control cohorts with primary
MMTV-Wnt1 tumor cells (21) into the fourth mammary
fat pad of the mice. We found that vitamin D-deficient
mice developed mammary tumors that were palpable an
average of 7 days earlier than control mice. Importantly,
vitamin D deficiency also accelerated tumor growth, re-
sulting in a significant increase in the mean tumor volume
after 6 weeks compared with tumors grown in mice fed the
control diet (Figure 1A).
Tumor autonomous effects of vitamin D/VDR
signaling
We next explored whether the impact of vitamin D
signaling on tumor growth was tumor autonomous or
resulted from systemic effects. First, we examined 2 BCa
cell lines that stably express luciferase, 168FARN and 4T1
(22), for their in vivo growth characteristics and VDR
expression levels. As previously reported (23), we found
that the tumors generated in vivo from 4T1 cells grew
more rapidly and developed distal metastases, whereas the

 168FARN tumors grew more slowly and did not macro-
metastasize outside of the primary tumor site (Figure 1B).
Intriguingly, we discovered that the highly aggressive and
metastatic 4T1 cell line has significantly lower levels of
VDR expression compared with the less aggressive, met-
astatic-deficient 168FARN cell line (Figure 1C).
In order to test whether the observed difference in ag-
gressiveness between the cell lines is regulated by the dif-
ferences in vitamin D/VDR signaling in the tumor cells, we
generated a 168FARN cell line with stable Vdr knock-
down (VDR KD). We confirmed that Vdr KD results in a
substantial decrease in VDR levels compared with the vec-
tor control cells selected in parallel (Figure 1D). To vali-
date that this level of Vdr KD is functionally relevant, we
treated the VDR KD and vector control cell lines with
calcitriol. A robust induction in mRNA expression of the
classic calcitriol target gene, Cyp24A1, was observed in
control cells, whereas this functional response was signif-
icantly diminished in VDR KD cells, demonstrating the
attenuation of VDR signaling (Figure 1E). To establish
that any functional differences between the vector control
and VDR KD cell lines were specifically due to inhibition
of Vdr expression, we rescued Vdr expression in the VDR
KD line by stably integrating a Vdr expression vector into
the VDR KD cell line (VDR Rescue), which rescued both
VDR levels and function (Figure 1, D and E).
To test the effect of Vdr KD on cell migration, an early
step in BCa progression, we used a transwell migration
assay (24, 25). We discovered that VDR KD cells exhibit
a notable increase in the number of migratory cells com-
pared with control cells and this phenotype was rescued in
the VDR Rescue cells (Figure 1F). These data indicate that
VDR signaling is functionally relevant to regulating BCa
migration ex vivo and therefore may impact BCa progres-
sion and metastasis.
Loss of vitamin D/VDR signaling promotes BCa
metastasis in vivo
We next examined whether there are tumor autono-
mous effects of vitamin D signaling in vivo using the VDR
KD cells. We established mammary tumors in BALB/c
mice by orthotopic injections of the luc-labeled control,
VDR KD, and VDR Rescue cell lines and followed tumor
appearance and growth over 4 weeks by BLI (26). We
found that VDR KD tumors grew significantly faster than
control or VDR Rescue cells in vivo (Figure 2A). This
striking pattern remained consistent until the endpoint of
the study when the mice with VDR KD tumors needed to
be euthanized for morbidity (Figure 2B). Primary tumors
wereharvested,measured,weighed,andimaged(Figure2,
C and D, and Supplemental Figure 2). These results con-
firmed the in vivo BLI signal data that the VDR KD tumors

 were substantially larger than control and VDR Rescue
tumors. Remarkably, ex vivo BLI imaging (Figure 2E) and
direct histology (Supplemental Figure 3) revealed that
60% of the mice with VDR KD tumors had metastatic
spread to the liver. This represents a particularly signifi-
cant finding as no evidence of macrometastatic tumor
spread was found in the control or rescue groups (Figure
2E and Supplemental Figure 3). Our results indicate that
loss of vitamin D/VDR signaling is sufficient to convert the
cells from nonmetastatic to metastatic.
Vitamin D/VDR regulates Id1 expression in BCa
In order to elucidate the mechanisms by which vitamin
D/VDR signaling exerts an inhibitory effect on tumor pro-
gression, we performed expression profiling using PCR
arrays comparing tumors that developed in the diet-in-
duced vitamin D-deficient mice with tumors that devel-
oped in mice fed the standard chow. In addition, we com-
pared the expression profile of the VDR KD cells with
control cells. We then compared the differentially (�2-
fold) expressed genes to identify genes with similarly al-
tered expression profiles in both tumors from vitamin D-
deficient mice and VDR KD cells (Supplemental Table 1).
These studies revealed Id1 as significantly up-regulated in
both the tumors that developed in vitamin D-deficient
mice and the VDR KD cells, suggesting that Id1 is re-
pressed by VDR signaling in BCa. This ’hit’ was of par-
ticular interest because of the role of Id1 in BCa progres-
sion (27) and most intriguing because calcitriol was found
to induce, rather than repress, ID1 expression in a colon
carcinoma cell line (28). We validated that Id1 expression
was up-regulated in both tumors from vitamin D-deficient
mice as well as in the VDR KD cells (Figure 3, A and B).
To test whether the regulation of Id1 by VDR is ligand
dependent in BCa cells, we treated 168FARN cells with
calcitriol and showed that this treatment represses the ex-
pression of Id1 (Figure 3C). We also found that calcitriol
treatment significantly decreases Inhibitor of differentia-
tion 1 (ID1) protein levels in a dose-dependent manner
(Figure 3D). This suppression of Id1 by calcitriol treat-
ment was substantially abrogated in the VDR KD cells
(Figure 3D). Interestingly, basal levels of ID1 protein ex-
pression were significantly increased in the VDR KD cell
line relative to control cells (Figure 3D) and the VDR Res-
cue cell line had lower levels of ID1 (Figure 3E; reprobed
Western blot from Figure 1D). These results suggest that
VDR might directly regulate Id1 in BCa cells and that
basal endogenous levels of VDR suppress Id1 expression.
Therefore, we investigated the promoter and proximal re-
gion of the Id1 gene for a negative vitamin D response
element (nVDRE) that is functional in BCa cells. We trans-
fected cells with a construct containing an approximately
1.5-kb fragment of the Id1 promoter and proximal region
cloned into a luciferase reporter vector and found that
calcitriol treatment of the transfected cells results in de-

 creased luciferase activity (Figure 3F), whereas VDR KD
increased luciferase levels (Supplemental Figure 4). Using
luciferase reporter vectors with sequential deletions, we
mapped a nVDRE to approximately 1 kb upstream of the
Id1 transcriptional start site as functionally relevant in
BCa cells (Figure 3F), the same nVDRE that is active in
murineosteoblasts(29).Usingchromatinimmunoprecipi-
tation of VDR on the endogenous nVDRE, we confirmed
that calcitriol treatment enriches VDR occupancy of this
element in 168FARN cells (Figure 3G).
We next tested whether the regulation of Id1 is the
mechanism underlying the effect of vitamin D/VDR sig-
naling to inhibit tumor cell migration and metastasis. In
the transwell migration assay, KD of Vdr expression in-
creased cell migration, as we showed previously in Figure
1F. Importantly, we discovered that KD of Id1 in VDR KD
cells abolished the increase in cell migration seen in VDR
KD cells, reducing the number of cells migrating back to
control levels (Figure 3H).
Vitamin D/VDR regulation of ID1 is conserved in
human BCa
To determine whether the findings from our mouse
models are relevant to human BCa, we first tested whether
ID1 expression is modulated by calcitriol treatment in the
widely studied human breast adenocarcinoma cell line
MDA-MB-231 (30). We found that calcitriol robustly
down-regulated ID1 mRNA (Figure 4A) and protein lev-
els (Figure 4B). Next, we searched the sequence of the
human ID1 gene in silico and identified a DNA element

ciferasereportervectorcontainingthehumanID1promoter
and 1.3 kb of the upstream proximal region, we confirmed
thattheconservednVDREregulatoryelementinID1isfunc-
tional in human BCa cells (Figure 4C).
In order to test whether our findings are relevant to pa-
tients with BCa, we obtained permission from our IRB and
were generously granted access by the independent investi-
gators of a recently completed clinical trial (NCT01472445)
to deidentified data in order to examine the relationship be-
tweencirculating25(OH)DlevelsandtumorID1expression
levels in patients undergoing BCa resections. This study was
a randomized, double blind clinical trial in women with
newly diagnosed BCa. Vitamin D3 was administered orally
in the neo-adjuvant period to women scheduled for surgical
resection of their tumors, with the intervention occurring
duringthe1-to6-weekneo-adjuvantintervalbeforesurgery.
Subjects were randomly assigned to receive either 400 or
10 000 IU/d of vitamin D3 in a 1:2 ratio, respectively. This
enabled us to analyze the relationship between a patient’s
circulating 24(OH)D level and ID1 expression levels in their
tumor at the same point in time (at surgical resection).
We found that serum 25(OH)D levels at the time of
surgery were negatively associated with ID1 expression
levels in the corresponding tumors (Spearman correlation
coefficient r � �0.579, P � .001),
with every 10-ng increase in circulat-
ing 25(OH)D levels being associated
with a 20% reduction in ID1 expres-
sion levels in the tumor (Figure 4D).
These results indicate that the rela-
tionship between Id1 expression and
vitamin D status/VDR signaling that
we identified in our mouse studies is
conserved in humans and is relevant
to patients with BCa.
Although many studies have in-
vestigated the effects of the adminis-
tration of calcitriol or vitamin D an-
alogs as a therapeutic approach in
BCa (1), relatively less attention has
been focused on specifically evaluat-
ing the detrimental effects of vitamin
D deficiency on BCa progression and
to metastasis. Our results show that
dietary vitamin D deficiency acceler-
ates the growth of BCa tumors. Fur-
ther, we discovered that attenuated
vitamin D signaling due to Vdr ab-
lation enhances tumor progression
and, importantly, is sufficient to enable metastases, which
are the primary cause of treatment failure and death for
patients with BCa.
We also discovered that, although circulating 25(OH)D
has many systemic effects (1), a critical mechanism for vita-
min D signaling to inhibit BCa progression is a tumor au-
tonomous activity that suppresses Id1 expression. Interest-
ingly,Shermanetal(31)foundatumorcellnonautonomous
mechanism for VDR signaling to inhibit pancreatic ductal
adenocarcinoma progression and Fernandez-Garcia et al
(28) found that calcitriol induces, rather than inhibits, Id1
expression in a colon carcinoma cell line. Lungchukiet et al
found that VDR tumor autonomously inhibits ovarian can-
cer invasion and metastasis through both ligand dependent
and independent mechanisms (32). These distinctions with
our study indicate that vitamin D signaling is highly context
specific.
Significantly, our results demonstrate that, in BCa cells,
VDR regulation of ID1 expression is mechanistically con-
served in humans and that there is a negative association
between circulating 25(OH)D levels and the expression of
ID1 in primary tumors from BCa patients. We believe
these findings contribute to the cause of the epidemiolog-
ical association between low circulating 25(OH)D levels
and poor prognosis in patients with BCa. In addition, our
data suggest that correcting vitamin D deficiency in BCa
