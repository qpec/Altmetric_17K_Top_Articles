SUMMARY
A subset of human neocortical neurons harbors com-
plex karyotypes wherein megabase-scale copy-
number variants (CNVs) alter allelic diversity. Diver-
gent levels of neurons with complex karyotypes
(CNV neurons) are reported in different individuals,
yet genome-wide and familial studies implicitly
assume a single brain genome when assessing the
genetic risk architecture of neurological disease.
We assembled a brain CNV atlas using a robust
computational approach applied to a new dataset
(>800 neurons from 5 neurotypical individuals) and
to published data from 10 additional neurotypical
individuals. The atlas reveals that the frequency of
neocortical neurons with complex karyotypes varies
widely among individuals, but this variability is not
readily accounted for by tissue quality or CNV detec-
tion approach. Rather, the age of the individual is
anti-correlated with CNV neuron frequency. Fewer
CNV neurons are observed in aged individuals than
in young individuals.
INTRODUCTION
Neocortical neurons are among the most diverse and longest-
lived mammalian cells. The mammalian cerebral cortex is often
put forward as a pinnacle of evolutionary complexity, and hu-
man-specific brain phenotypes are attributed to neocortical
expansion during evolution (Geschwind and Rakic, 2013; Lui
et al., 2011). Aberrant development and maturation of neocor-
tical circuits are likewise associated with neuropsychiatric and
neurodegenerative diseases (Del Pino et al., 2018; Morrison
and Baxter, 2012; S€
udhof, 2017). Various approaches count
�15–20 billion neurons and as many as 35 billion glia in the
human cerebral cortex (Pakkenberg et al., 2003; von Bartheld
et al., 2016). Single-cell transcriptomic approaches are begin-
ning to comprehensively catalog human neuronal diversity
(Lake et al., 2016; Nowakowski et al., 2017) and identify new
subtypes of human neurons (Boldog et al., 2018). After decades
of debate, it is now clear that human neocortical neurons are not
normally regenerated during the human lifespan (Bhardwaj et al.,
2006; Rakic, 2006). With some exceptions (Spitzer, 2017),
neuronal cell types are also generally thought to be stable
throughout life, but neuronal genomes are surprisingly labile.
Every human neocortical neuron may contain private somatic
variants. Single nucleotide variants (SNVs) are especially com-
mon, with hundreds per neuron reported (Bae et al., 2018; Lo-
dato et al., 2015) and with frequencies of >3,000 SNVs per
neuron observed in aged individuals (Lodato et al., 2018).
Endogenous mobile elements such as long interspersed nuclear
element 1 (LINE1) retrotransposons are also active during brain
development (Coufal et al., 2009; Muotri et al., 2005). Reported
frequencies of de novo mobile element events range from <1
to >7 per neuron (Baillie et al., 2011; Evrony et al., 2012; Upton
et al., 2015). Mobile element activity has also been linked to
the generation of copy-number variants (CNVs) (Erwin et al.,
2016; Gilbert et al., 2002). Whole and subchromosomal CNVs
bring about complex karyotypes through the duplication or dele-
tion of several megabases (Mb) of genomic sequence in a sub-
population of neocortical neurons (Cai et al., 2014; Knouse
et al., 2016; McConnell et al., 2013; Piotrowski et al., 2008).
Gene density in the human genome averages >10 genes per
Mb; thus, by contrast to other somatic variants, Mb-scale
CNVs almost always affect multiple genes. A reanalysis of pub-
lished data (Cai et al., 2014; Knouse et al., 2014; McConnell et al.,

 2013; van den Bos et al., 2016) herein found an average of 63
genes affected per neuronal CNV.
During the past decade, large CNVs have been recognized as
major contributors to human genetic diversity (Conrad et al.,
2010; Lupski, 2015; Redon et al., 2006). At the population level,
SNVs are collectively more numerous than CNVs, but CNVs
affect an order of magnitude more genome sequence (�10%),
and some CNVs show evidence of positive selection during hu-
man evolution (Perry et al., 2007; Sudmant et al., 2015; Zarrei
et al., 2015). In individuals, de novo CNVs represent rare variants
with a strong contribution to the genetic risk of schizophrenia,
autism, and other neurological disorders (Fromer et al., 2014;
Iossifov et al., 2014; Marshall et al., 2017; Morrow, 2010; Sebat
et al., 2007). Whereas the consequences of germline CNVs
have been inferred from population-level studies, neuronal
CNV studies to date have been underpowered to determine
whether the genes affected by neuronal CNVs contribute to brain
development, function, and disease.
We assembled a brain CNV atlas to evaluate how neuronal
CNVs alter the genetic architecture of the neurotypical human
cerebral cortex. A new dataset of 827 human cerebral cortical
nuclei from 5 neurotypical individuals was combined with smaller
published datasets (Cai et al., 2014; Knouse et al., 2014; McCon-
nell et al., 2013; van den Bos et al., 2016) from 10 other neurotyp-
ical individuals. We developed an unbiased CNV detection
approach based on population-level statistics and established
a human neuronal CNV atlas with 507 CNVs. Initial analysis of
the atlas identified substantial inter-individual variability in the
frequency of neurons with complex karyotypes (CNV neurons),
but also found support for the hypothesis (Weissman and
Gage, 2016) that some long genomic loci shape the genetic ar-
chitecture of neurotypical human brains.
RESULTS
Generation of Single-Cell Neuronal and Non-neuronal
Genomic Data
Single neuronal and non-neuronal nuclei were isolated using
fluorescence-activated nuclei sorting (FANS) of the prefrontal
cortex from 5 non-diseased (neurotypical) male individuals
aged 0.36, 26, 49, 86, and 95 years (Figure 1A; Table 1). Whole
genome amplification (WGA) was performed using PicoPLEX
(Rubicon Genomics), an approach that is similar to multiple an-
nealing and loop-based amplification (MALBAC) (Zong et al.,
2012), which produces Illumina-compatible libraries with 48
unique barcodes. Before library pooling and sequencing on Illu-
mina platforms, we found that �60% of WGA reactions pro-
duced
a
measurable
product.
Single-end
or
paired-end
sequencing (50, 75, or 100 bp) of 48 pooled libraries on Illumina
HiSeq Rapid platforms or of smaller pools (<17 libraries) on
MiSeq platforms routinely produced >1 million reads per library
after duplicate removal. Neither paired-end nor longer read
sequencing altered the data quality. Reads were aligned to
hg19 and read depth was calculated across 4,505 genomic
bins, each containing �500 kb of uniquely mappable sequence
(mean bin size = 687 ± 1,072 kb). This approach (Figure 1B)
generated >134.2 Gb of genomic sequence from 827 male sin-
gle-cell genome libraries (162.3 ± 115.1 Mb/cell).
Optimization of Read Depth-Based Single-Cell Genomic
Segmentation
Neuronal CNV detection is inherently challenging because one
cannot know the state of the genome before WGA, and neuronal
CNVs are rarely clonal. For this reason, CNV calling approaches
have been used conservatively, with bias toward avoiding type I
errors at the risk of type II errors. We used a test dataset of 6
representative PicoPLEX WGA libraries (5 neurons and 1 trisomy
21 fibroblast) with varied subjective quality (Figures 1C and S1A–
S1E) to optimize our approach.
Parameter space in DNAcopy (Olshen et al., 2004) is defined by
3 user-tunable parameters: significance threshold (alpha), mini-
mum number of genomic bins required to call a copy number state
change (min.width), and the number of SDs between the levels of
copy-number states to maintain the copy-number state change
(undo.SD). We assessed DNAcopy parameters using Bayesian
information criterion (BIC) (Schwarz, 1978), a log-likelihood esti-
mate of the performance of the segmentation algorithm, for
dozens of parameter combinations. The lowest, or near-lowest,
BIC scores for each test cell library were observed at alpha =
0.001,min.width = 5,and undo.SD= 0 (Figures 1Dand S1G); these
parameters identified monosomy X in all 6 male cells, and trisomy
21 in only the fibroblast. We also observed that minimum BIC
scoreswere lower inWGA libraries withlessoverall bin-to-binvari-
ation in read-depth (Figures 1C, S1A–S1E, and S1G), suggesting
that low BIC scores represent an additional quality control filter.
We further assessed segmentation parameters with 2 in silico
models (Figure S1F) built from the read-depth statistics (DNA-
copy segments, Gaussian noise, and autocorrelated noise [f])
of each test cell. NULL model simulations contained no CNVs
but did contain strong autocorrelated noise, a known source of
DNAcopy false-positives (Muggeo and Adelfio, 2011). Alterna-
tive (ALT) model simulations harbored synthetic CNVs (i.e., DNA-
copy calls) with residual autocorrelated noise. Segmentation
outputs matched the ALT model, but not the NULL model, sim-
ulations well (Figures S1H and S1I). Concordance with ALT
model cells (i.e., highest sensitivity and specificity) was also
associated with the lowest BIC scores (Figure S1J).
Analysis of 827 PicoPLEX datasets identified additional popu-
lation-based filters. First, we identified 101 genomic bins that
routinely deviated from median read depth and confound seg-
mentation (Figure S1K); these were excluded before the subse-
quent analysis. Second, we computed the 95th percentile of the
low BIC score Gaussian distribution (�2.21) to establish an
objective filter for the highest quality single-cell datasets (Fig-
ure 1E). Third, identified segments displayed 2 modes near
integer-like copy number (CN) states of 2 (euploid, mean =
1.97) and 1 (deletion, mean = 1.12) and a heavy tail near the CN
state of 3 (duplication, mean = 2.92) (Figure 1F). Lenient and strin-
gent CN state thresholds were established, respectively, at a
2-tailed p value % 0.05 (<1.34 for a deletion and >2.60 for a dupli-
cation) and %0.01 (<1.14 for a deletion and >2.80 for a duplica-
tion). The BIC threshold produced a final dataset of 589/827
(71.2%) neural nuclei, including 474/681 (69.6%) neuronal
(NeuN+) nuclei and 115/146 (78.8%) non-neuronal (NeuN�) nuclei
(Figures S1L and S1M). The stringent CN state threshold identi-
fied monosomy X in 52.8% of male neural nuclei, while the lenient
threshold identified 99.5% of these true-positives (Figure S2A).

 Additional NULL and ALT model simulations found that BIC
cutoffs and CN state thresholds protect against false-positive
CNVs brought about by simulated WGA-induced noise. We
tested 6 neuronal WGA libraries in the BIC <�2.21 PicoPLEX da-
taset: 2 euploid, 2 with 1 CNV, 1 with 3 CNVs, and 1 with 6 CNVs.

 neuron 10 were excluded by our BIC threshold as a conse-
quence of strong autocorrelated noise (f = 0.663; atlas mean
f = 0.1394). In the remaining 1,000 simulated cells, only 41
and 1 small (3.9 ± 0.7 Mb) segments, respectively, passed the
lenient and stringent CN state thresholds. Thus, upper-bound
estimates of false-positive CNV neuron detection rates are
�3% (lenient threshold) and <0.1% (stringent threshold). All
ALT model simulations (Figure S2C) passed the BIC threshold,
and only �1% (14/1,200) of simulated cells contained DNAcopy
segments that passed the lenient CN state thresholds without
overlapping the synthetic CNV; these false-positive CNVs were
also small (6.0 ± 2.7 Mb). As observed for monosomy X in the
PicoPLEX dataset, improved detection of true-positives (syn-
thetic CNVs) in ALT model cells was observed at lenient (95%)
relative to stringent (81.8%) CN state thresholds.
Contribution of Mosaic CNVs to Neuronal Diversity
Large CNVs inevitably alter the CN state of a brain-expressed
gene, as more of the genome is expressed in neurons than in
other cell types (Uhle
´ n et al., 2016). Our analysis (Table 1) iden-
tified 310 CNVs in 70 of 589 neural genomes (11.9%). CNVs
ranged in size from 2.9 to 159.1 Mb (mean = 16.5 ± 20.1 Mb; Fig-
ure 2A). With stringent criteria that are prone to false-negatives,
we still identify 168 CNVs (mean = 18.0 ± 22.3 Mb) in 42 neural
nuclei (7.1%) (Figure S3A). CNVs were detected in each individ-
ual examined and, given their size and frequency (Figures 2B and
S3D), represent a clear contribution to the genetic architecture of
the brain (Figures 2C and S3G). We note that much smaller per-
centages of phenotypically distinct cells can bring about focal
epilepsies (Marin-Valencia et al., 2014) and are essential for
normal brain function (e.g., adult-born dentate granule neurons;
Anacker and Hen, 2017; Christian et al., 2014).
The 474 neuronal nuclei we analyzed represent the largest
CNV dataset of neurotypical human brains generated by a single
laboratory using a single WGA approach to date. We identified
62 CNV neurons (13.1%) with a mean CNV size of 16.8 Mb.
We find that both neuronal and non-neuronal genomes harbor
Mb-scale CNVs, which is consistent with previous reports (Cai
et al., 2014; Knouse et al., 2016). The frequency (4%–23.1%)
of complex karyotypes was more variable among neurons than

 among non-neuronal cells (4.7%–8.7%) from the same individ-
uals (Figure 2D). CNV frequency in non-neuronal cells is similar
to that reported in other somatic cells (e.g., keratinocytes). Rela-
tive to non-neuronal CNVs (Figures S3B, S3C, S3E, S3F, S3H,
and S3I), neuronal CNVs are larger (Figure 2E), occur in greater
numbers (Figure 2F), and affect more of the genome (1.3%–
6% in neurons, 0.2%–0.8% in non-neurons; Figure 2G). Similar
ratios of neuronal to non-neuronal CNVs were observed at
stringent thresholds, but mean differences in non-euploid CN
states were amplified (Figures S3K– S3M). A statistically signifi-
cant linear decline in CNV neuron abundance was observed with
age at both CN state thresholds (lenient: R2 = 0.9224, p = 0.0094,
Figure 2H; stringent: R2 = 0.9434, p = 0.0058, Figure S3O).
Analysis and Integration of Publicly Available Data
Four previous studies used different WGA and CNV detection
approaches on 458 additional single neurons from 6 male and 5
female neurotypical individuals of different ages (Cai et al.,
2014; Knouse et al., 2014; McConnell et al., 2013; van den Bos
et al., 2016). WGA was performed using GenomePlex (Cai
et al., 2014; Knouse et al., 2014; McConnell et al., 2013), a degen-
erate oligonucleotide-primed (DOP)-PCR-based approach, or
Strand-seq (van den Bos et al., 2016), a ‘‘pre-amplification
free’’ approach. We harmonized these with our PicoPLEX dataset
(e.g., alignment to hg19, exclusion of outlier bins in Figures S4A
and S4B, BIC thresholds in Figures 3A, 3B, S4G, and S4H).
GenomePlex and Strand-seq datasets displayed distinct outlier
bin profiles. Analysis of RepeatMasker (University of California,
Santa Cruz [UCSC]) genomic features in outlier bins found a
depletion (log2 fold change <�0.25) of DNA, LINE, and long ter-
minal repeat (LTR) features, and enrichment (log2 fold change
>0.47) for short interspersed nuclear element (SINE) and simple
repeat features (Wilcoxon, p < 2.2E–16) compared to remaining
bins. BIC thresholds removed 11/225 GenomePlex cells (4.9%)
and 41/233 Strand-seq cells (18.0%) from further analysis. The
CN state thresholds reported above (Figure 1F) were inclusive
of all of the WGA libraries passing BIC cutoffs. To further test
the effectiveness of outlier bin removal, BIC cutoffs, and CNV
thresholds, we re-analyzed split-amplification GenomePlex li-
braries from Knouse et al. (2016). One split-sample exceeded
the BIC cutoff; the other with bad bins removed showed perfect
concordance using our analysis pipeline (Figures S4C–S4F).
The general characteristics of CNVs were similar regard-
less of WGA approach or sex (Figure 3C–3E). The mean length

 of single-cell CNVs was 14.8 Mb across all of the datasets, which
is notably larger than most CNVs observed in bulk, germline hu-
man genomes (1–10 kb; MacDonald et al., 2014). As with Pico-
PLEX data, CNV size was variable among individuals (Figures
S4J, S4K, S4M, S4N, S4P, and S4Q), but average CNV size
was similar across WGA approaches (Figures 3C–3E). The
average CNV size in GenomePlex libraries was 11.7 Mb, but it
ranged from 4.1 to 15.9 Mb among individuals. The average
CNV size in Strand-seq libraries was 13.2 Mb, but it ranged
from 4.3 to 17.7 Mb among individuals. Similar but on average
larger CNV sizes were observed at the stringent threshold (Fig-
ures S4I, S4L, and S4O). In contrast to a previous report (Knouse
et al., 2016), no enrichment for LINE1 sequence was apparent in
CNVs or CNV borders compared to chance, and equal rates of
telomeric CNVs (�14%) were observed in young and aged neu-
rons (see Method Details).
Anti-correlation between CNV neuron prevalence and individ-
ual age is roughly an order of magnitude more significant in the
complete atlas (lenient: R2 = 0.5521, p = 0.00097, Figure 3F;
stringent: R2 = 0.3941, p = 0.0092, Figure S4R). Despite narrower
age ranges, CNV neuron prevalence was also anti-correlated
with age in the published datasets (lenient: R2 = 0.5315, p =
0.011, Figure S4S; stringent: R2 = 0.3524, p = 0.054, Figure S4T).
Potential confounding variables such as BIC scores or post-
mortem interval showed no significant correlation with age
(Figure S5).

contrasts with the concept of genosenium (Lodato et al.,
2018), which states that the accumulation of somatic mutations
over one’s lifetime is associated with aging-related cellular and
molecular phenotypes. Thus, we also analyzed the number of
CNVs per CNV neuron. Most CNV neurons (62.8%) contained
only 1 or 2 CNVs, but the average number of CNVs per CNV
neuron in the atlas was 3.9 (Figure 3D). Aged CNV neurons,
although rare, had more irregular karyotypes. For example, the
20-year-old individual had the highest percentage of CNV neu-
rons (40% CNV neurons, 3.8 CNVs/CNV neuron), but the 49-
year-old (11.1% CNV neurons) had the most CNVs/CNV neurons
(10.3). Other individuals, such as the 24-year-old and the
86-year-old, also support this trend; 38.9% of neurons in the
24-year-old had CNVs with an average of 2.8 CNVs/CNV neuron,
whereas only 4% of neurons in the 86-year-old had CNVs, but
these CNV neurons averaged 5.0 CNVs. The individual with the
highest mean CNV size (37.2 Mb) was 86 years old (Figure S4J);

 this was due in large part to 1 neuron containing 2 trisomies and 1
monosomy (Figure S3N). Genosenium, if true, may operate on
different somatic mutations in distinct ways.
Long Gene Mosaicism and Neuronal Diversity
Brain CNVs, like all non-V(D)J CNVs, occur because DNA repair
is not perfect. Transcription and replication lead to DNA double-
strand breaks (DSBs), which in turn sometimes lead to CNVs.
Gene length increases susceptibility to transcriptional and repli-
cative genomic stress. Genes encoded by >100 kb of genomic
sequence (i.e., long genes) tend to be neuronally expressed
genes with roles in neuronal connectivity and synaptic plasticity
(Zylka et al., 2015). Long genes also overlap with DNA fragile
sites, and replicative stress can lead to large CNVs that encom-
pass these loci (Wilson et al., 2015). Likewise, transcriptional
stress leads to DNA DSBs in neurons (Madabhushi et al., 2015)
and has a predominant effect on long gene transcript abundance
(King et al., 2013). Recent studies link these observations to DNA
DSBs during mouse neurodevelopment (Wei et al., 2016) and
motivate the hypothesis that somatic mutations affecting long
genes mediate the functional consequences of brain somatic
mosaicism (Weissman and Gage, 2016).
The assembled atlas identified 522 neural CNVs (Table 1). We
performed overlap and random permutation analyses to deter-
mine whether subsets of 93 candidate long genes (Figure 4A)
were associated with CNVs more frequently than expected by
chance. Genomic regions (i.e., bins) that accumulated CNVs
(i.e., duplications and deletions) at an increased population-
wide frequency compared to the rest of the genome (i.e., hot-
spots; Figure 4B) were determined using different hotspot
thresholds (see Method Details). Enrichment was assessed by
calculating 184 raw p values (8 candidate gene lists, 23 hotspot
thresholds) from 10,000 permutations per gene list per hotspot
threshold. After correcting for multiple hypothesis testing (Benja-
mini-Hochberg false discovery rate [FDR], 5% FDR cutoff), data-
set-wide significance was observed for the entire candidate

 gene list in some cases, and, notably, with putative hotspots that
include 3 of the 4 common candidate genes: GPC6, NRXN3, and
RBFOX1 (Figure 4C).
CNV neurons were rare in aged individuals, so we assessed
whether the genetic architecture of CNV neurons may also
change during the lifespan. We further tested each individual in
the atlas for candidate gene enrichment using relevant thresh-
olds for recurrent hotspots (see Method Details) at stringent
and lenient criteria. Significant corrected p values were not
observed in the youngest individuals, but they were observed
in aged individuals (Figure 4D). When individuals were pooled
based on age groups, significant p values were also observed
only in the most aged group (Figure 4E).
CNV-affected loci may not be restricted to long genes. We
assembled a comprehensive list of all of the genes affected
in the brain CNV atlas and used PANTHER (Mi et al., 2013) to
calculate enrichment statistics and plotting scripts from REViGO
(Supek et al., 2011) to visualize these results. Gene Ontology
categories associated with ‘‘sensory perception of smell’’ and
‘‘calcium-mediated signaling’’ were notably enriched in the
atlas-wide gene set (Figure 4F). When assessed by age group,
as in Figure 4E, these enrichments were only detected in the
aged groups (Figures 4G and 4H).
DISCUSSION
Brain somatic mosaicism is a largely unexplored aspect of
neuronal diversity (Harbom et al., 2018). In the human cerebral
cortex, neuronal diversity is described in terms of electrophysio-
logical properties (Contreras, 2004) and gene expression profiles
(Lake et al., 2016) that are brought about by genetic programs
(Lein et al., 2017). Current neurodevelopmental models implicitly
assume that all somatic cells operate with identical genomes. In
turn, population-based genetic studies of neurological disease
typically sequence bulk blood DNA as a proxy for brain DNA.
Somatic mutations affecting cell proliferation and survival path-
ways can alter neuronal diversity and lead to cortical overgrowth
phenotypes
ranging
from
hemimegalencephaly
to
focal
dysplasia (Jamuar et al., 2014; Lee et al., 2012; Mirzaa et al.,
2016; Poduri et al., 2012). Elevated levels of somatic mutations
have also been associated with Rett syndrome (Muotri et al.,
2010), neurodegenerative disease (Bushman et al., 2015; Iourov
et al., 2009; Lee et al., 2018; Lodato et al., 2018; McConnell et al.,
2004), schizophrenia (Bundo et al., 2014), and altered behavior
(Bedrosian et al., 2018). The Brain Somatic Mosaicism Network
is an ongoing multi-site effort that aims to define how brain so-
matic mutations affect the genetic architecture of psychiatric
disease (McConnell et al., 2017). However, the consequences
of somatic mutations in neurotypical human brains remain a cen-
tral unaddressed question. We report a neurotypical human
brain somatic CNV atlas to begin to assess how mosaic somatic
mutations affect neuronal diversity.
We assembled a brain CNV atlas from 1,285 single brain
nucleus libraries, the accumulated work of our laboratory and
3 other laboratories. Development of a single, robust compu-
tational pipeline that both protected against false-positive
CNV calls and minimized false-negative calls was essential.
First, we identified and excluded a small group (101/4,505) of
genomic bins that were consistently non-euploid (i.e., outliers)
across our 5 analyzed individuals. Second, we applied an objec-
tive BIC cutoff to exclude WGA libraries that would be the most
prone to aberant segmentation calls. Third, we evaluated pub-
lished datasets from 4 other sources that used different WGA
methods. Population-level statistics were generally similar, but
each WGA approach identified unique outlier bins and slightly
different BIC cutoffs. Fourth, CN state distributions centered
near CN = 1, 2, and 3 were apparent across all of the WGA ap-
proaches, so we used 2-tailed p values (lenient = 0.05, strin-
gent = 0.01) from pan-method DNAcopy segmentation calls to
define 2 sets of CN state thresholds. Fifth, we showed that these
filters (outlier bin removal, BIC cutoffs, and CN state thresholds)
effectively eliminate false-positive CNV calls (15/2,400; <1%).
Lenient CN state thresholds are mildly (<3%) more prone to
short (�<6 Mb) false-positive calls, but far better at identifying
true-positives (>95%). Our central findings are unchanged
when only the largest (>6 Mb) CNVs are considered. The brain
CNV atlas comprises 879 neuronal and 115 non-neuronal
genomic libraries; Mb-scale CNVs were identified in 129 neu-
rons and 8 non-neurons.
The most salient feature of the brain CNV atlas is an anti-cor-
relation between the age of an individual and the percentage of
CNV neurons in the frontal cortex of that individual. This finding
was significant in our new PicoPLEX dataset and in the pub-
lished GenomePlex and Strand-seq datasets, and is highly sig-
nificant using all of the available data (p = 0.00097). By
contrast, the initial assessment of CNV location finds evidence
for the enrichment of a subset of long genes and neurally asso-
ciated Gene Ontology categories only in aged brains. Given the
enrichment of these CNVs in aged, not young, neurons, CNVs
affecting some genomic loci may be more compatible with
neural survival than others. We found similar rates of CNV
non-neurons at different ages; however, it will be interesting
to determine whether other long-lived cells (e.g., cardiomyo-
cytes) show a similar change in mosaic composition during
aging.
We provide evidence that a functional consequence of CNV
neurons may be selective vulnerability to aging-related cell
death. Age-related cognitive decline is associated with notable
decreases in cerebral cortical thickness, myelination, and syn-
apse number accompanied by ex vacuo enlargement in ventric-
ular volume (Morrison and Baxter, 2012). Although neuronal cell
death is generally considered to be minimal in the healthy mature
brain, rates of �10% cerebral cortical neuron loss during adult-
hood are consistent with stereological counts in neurotypical in-
dividuals (Pakkenberg et al., 2003). The decline in CNV neuron
prevalence that we observe between individuals <30 years old
and individuals >70 years old is also strikingly consistent with se-
lective CNV neuron loss during a person’s adult lifetime. We
conclude that the most parsimonious interpretation of these
data is that many, but not all, CNV neurons are selectively vulner-
able to aging-associated atrophy. This cross-sectional finding
highlights the unmet need for an increased longitudinal under-
standing of human neuronal genome dynamics during an individ-
ual’s health span. Human pluripotent stem cell-based models
(Brennand et al., 2015) represent a straightforward means to
this end.

METHOD DETAILS
Single nuclei isolation
All procedures were done on ice. Solutions were made using nuclease-free water and supplemented with freshly prepared 50 X pro-
teinase inhibitor just before use. Nuclei isolation media, optiprep nuclei diluent, nuclei storage buffer and blocking buffer (prior to add-
ing tween) were 0.22 mm filtered.
Buffers used:
1. Nuclei Isolation Media (NIM): 25 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 10 mM Tris-Cl (pH 8.8), 250 mM sucrose, 1mM dithiothreitol (DTT).
2. OptiPrep Density Gradient Medium (ODGM): 60% Iodixanol solution.
3. OptiPrep Nuclei Diluent (OND): 150 mM KCl, 30 mM MgCl2, 60 mM Tris-Cl (pH 8.8), 250 mM sucrose.
4. Blocking Buffer (BB): 1x PBS, 1.0% Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA), and 0.1% Tween 20.
5. Nuclei Storage Buffer (NSB): 5 mM MgCl2, 50 mM Tris-Cl (pH 8.8), 166 mM sucrose, 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT).
6. 50 X EDTA-free Protease Inhibitor Cocktail in nuclease-free water.
7. 10% Triton x-100 in nuclease-free water.
Post-mortem cortex was stored at �80�C until fragmented while frozen on dry ice in a pre-chilled mortar and pestle. Fragments
(�100 mg) were completely solubilized in 1 mL of nuclei isolation media (NIM) by gently triturating using a 1000 mL pipette tip.
We transferred slurry to a 5 mL round bottom, polypropylene tube and homogenized using a Polytron PT 1300 D tissue disruptor
for 2 minutes. The sample appeared opaque and homogeneous. We added 1 ml of 10% Triton X-100 (final conc. 0.01%) and gently
mixed by rotation before transferring to a dounce with large and small pestle clearance (0.0030-0.0050 in. and 0.0005-0.0025 in.,
respectively). After 15 stokes with each clearance we microscopically verified cell disruption with 0.4% trypan blue solution. We
centrifuged samples at 1,000 x g for 8 minutes at 4�C and re-suspended the pellet in 1 mL of 6:5:1 NIM:ODGM:OND (25% iodixanol).
We used a 1 mL syringe (without needle) to apply the suspension onto 1 mL of 29:31 ODGM:OND solution (29% iodixanol) in a 5 mL
thin-wall polyallomer ultracentrifuge tube (13 3 51 mm). Samples were centrifuged at 10,300 x g for 20 minutes at 4�C in a Beckman
L8-M ultracentrifuge using a SW55 Ti rotor. The supernatant containing cell debris was removed, leaving �50 mL in the bottom of the
tube. We confirmed the presence of nuclei by microscopy using 0.4% trypan blue and used immediately or stored up to 1 week in
NSB at 4�C without reduction in whole genome amplification efficiency.
Single nuclei genome sequencing
We labeled nuclei derived from neurons by incubating with mouse monoclonal anti-human NeuN IgG clone A60 (Alexa Fluor 555
conjugate) diluted 1:250 in blocking buffer overnight at 4�C. We verified that NeuN+ nuclei also contained dsDNA by co-staining
with either SYTO 13 green fluorescent nucleic acid stain at 500 nM or standard DAPI. We isolated individual NeuN+, DNA+ nuclei
by flow sorting into 8-well thin-wall PCR tube strips. At certain points in the execution of these procedures we also isolated indi-
vidual nuclei from the flow-sorted NeuN+, DNA+ nuclei pool using the CellRaft system (Cell Microsystems) to verify integrity of the
nuclei and quality of the WGA on a small scale. There are videos and extensive literature on the use of the CellRaft at https://www.
cellmicrosystems.com and Wierman et al. (2017). These quality control steps ensured the nuclei were intact and contained
genomic material suitable for WGA. The PicoPLEX Whole Genome Amplification Kit was applied to single nuclei according to man-
ufacturer’s instructions (Rubicon Genomics, Ann Arbor, MI). The PicoPLEX reaction enzymatically copies elements across the
e3

 entire genome, fragments DNA products, and bar-codes the fragments with unique Illumina i5 and i7 index sequences. We
confirmed reactions produced high molecular weight DNA by 1 X TBE, 1% agarose gel electrophoresis containing 1 mg/ml
ethidium bromide. Productive reactions were purified using QIAquick PCR purification columns. We quantified yields using the
high-sensitivity (HS) DNA Qubit 3.0 assay and combined equimolar portions of each purified PicoPLEX product into pools of
48 nuclei with compatible index combinations for multiplex sequencing. We electrophoresed pooled libraries into 0.75 mm thick
1 X TBE, 7.5% polyacrylamide (37.5:1 acrylamide:bisacrylamide) gels at 35 mA for 20 minutes and incubated with SYBR Gold
DNA stain diluted 1:10,000 in 1 X TBE for 5 minutes before excising sections containing 450 bp to 800 bp DNA fragments on
a UV transilluminator (long wave). We electro-eluted DNA from polyacrylamide sections into 1 X TAE, 1% low-melt agarose gel
containing 1 mg/ml ethidium bromide at 100 V for 15 minutes and isolated chunks containing DNA on a UV transilluminator
(long wave). DNA was purified from agarose using QG buffer according to the QIAquick PCR column protocol (QIAGEN). We quan-
tified size-selected pooled library DNA by HS DNA Qubit 3.0 assay and diluted to 6 nM prior to sequencing on the Illumina (San
Diego, CA) platform. We sequenced a total of 829 brain nuclei and used these for BIC and copy number state population statistics,
including threshold determination. Two single nuclei were flagged for ambiguous provenance. The CNV atlas includes 827 male
brain nuclei that were amplified by the DNA WGA PicoPLEX kit. These single nucleus genome sequencing procedures were pre-
viously described in McConnell et al. (2013) and in greater detail in Wierman et al. (2017).
Analysis of single cell sequencing data
Sequence reads from Illumina were trimmed of PicoPLEX primers using the fastx_trimmer command (hannonlab.cshl.edu/
fastx_toolkit/). Reads were then aligned to the human genome (version hg19) with BWA-aln V0.7.12 using default options (Li and
Durbin, 2009) and converted to BAM format using Samtools V1.1 (Li et al., 2009). Duplicates were removed using MarkDuplicates
(Picard tools V1.105, broadinstitute.github.io/picard). Using a 40-mer mappability track (UCSC, wgEncodeCrgMapabilityAlign40-
mer.bigWig) to determine uniquely mappable bases, we divided the genome into 4,505 dynamically sized genomic bins, each con-
taining 500kb of mappable sequence. The mean bin size was 687 kb. Read counts for each bin were determined by Bedtools V2.17.0
coverageBed (Quinlan and Hall, 2010). To avoid read count bias arising from GC content, bins were grouped into 16 roughly equal
size groups according to GC percentage and each read count within a GC group was divided by the median read count of the group
and multiplied by two.
Following analysis of several hundred single cell datasets, we observed that certain genomic bins were consistently above or
below the euploid state, most likely due to biases arising from alignment or artifacts generated during WGA. To avoid biases in
segmentation introduced by these outlier bins, namely false positive and false negative CNVs, we used Tukey’s Outlier Method
on the median log-copy number values of all 4,505 bins in a sex and WGA-specific fashion, resulting in between 101 and 153
bins to be excluded from segmentation, depending on the sex of the individual and WGA used. In addition to the bins excluded
by the outlier detection method, two Y chromosome bins were manually excluded from female Strand-seq dataset. Single cell data-
sets were segmented using DNAcopy (Seshan and Olshen, 2018), an R package (www.R-project.org) that implements circular binary
segmentation (CBS) to detect copy number ‘‘changepoints’’ in genomic data. DNAcopy was run on the normalized bin data using
parameters alpha = 0.001, undo.SD = 0, and min.width = 5.
BIC scoring and filtering
To determine which samples were of sufficient quality to merit further analysis, we implemented Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC)
(Schwarz, 1978)
BIC = ln
�
s2�
+ kp
n lnðnÞ
as a scoring metric where s2 is the variance of the data points about their respective segment means, kp is equal to 1 + 2*(number of
changepoints), and n is the number of bins (4,505) assuming a piecewise-constant, Gaussian error segmentation model (see Muggeo
and Adelfio (2011) for details of segmentation modeling and parameterization). The equation above shows the usual BIC score
divided by the number of bins, which is fixed across samples. BIC penalizes a segmentation that under-fits the data (i.e., allows
high variance of data within segments) or over-fits the data (i.e., creates too many segments); thus, a cell with properly fitted data
and relatively low bin value variance will receive a low BIC score.
To define threshold BIC scores for inclusion in further analysis, a histogram of BIC scores was generated for each WGA method.
Using the R package mixtools (Benaglia et al., 2009), we fit two Gaussian distributions to the PicoPLEX and Strand-seq histograms,
and one Gaussian distribution to the GenomePlex histogram due to its displaying a single mode. Using the Gaussian distribution
with the lower mean (or, in the case of GenomePlex, the lone distribution), we set the threshold BIC score for inclusion to correspond
to p = 0.05 on the upper tail. For PicoPLEX, cells scoring below �2.21 were selected for further analysis (Figure 1E); for GenomePlex,
the threshold was �2.05 (Figure S4G); for Strand-seq, the cutoff was �1.93 (Figure S4H).

 Defining CNVs
Because DNAcopy does not assign integer copy number values to the segments it outputs, it was necessary to define threshold copy
number values for a segment to be considered a CNV. We set CNV thresholds by evaluating autosomal segments of sizes ranging
from 5, our minimum number of bins required to call a CNV, and 45 bins, a length smaller than the shortest autosome, resulting in a
distribution of copy numbers excluding the high number of whole chromosomes at or near copy number two. The segments were
plotted by copy number value in a histogram, and we fit a three-Gaussian mixture model using mixtools (Benaglia et al., 2009)
and plotted the resulting mixed Gaussian model of three distributions centered at the local peaks near copy number 1, 2, and 3. Using
the central Gaussian, centered near 2, we calculated two sets of thresholds: the stringent thresholds, 2.80 and 1.14, the result of a
cumulative two-tailed probability of 0.01; and the lenient thresholds, 2.60 and 1.34, determined by a two-tailed cumulative probability
of 0.05. Throughout our CNV analyses, we used both thresholds in order to give a wider range of possible results and avoid any
influence of false positive or false negative CNVs. Additionally, CNVs were required to be at least 5 bins in length, and chromosomes
X and Y were not examined for CNVs.
Test data simulation
DNAcopy is prone to calling CNV events using correlated noise as input (Muggeo and Adelfio, 2011), so we sought to determine the
degree to which our single cell data contains correlated noise. We selected six single cells to simulate test data. In our ‘‘NULL model,’’
we assumed that the data for our six cells were described by correlated noise and Gaussian noise about the euploid copy number
state, and contained no real CNV events. In the ‘‘alternative model,’’ we assumed that the six cells were described by real CNV events
identified by DNAcopy and residual correlated and Gaussian noise. We simulated 200 test data cells for each of the cells under each
of the models and found that the CNVs produced by the NULL model rarely matched those of the original cell in size or divergence
from 2 (Figure S1H), leading us to conclude that the ALT model was a more accurate representation of our data (Figure S1I). To deter-
mine the best DNAcopy segmentation parameters, we used simulation data of the ‘‘alternative model’’ to explore values of alpha
ranging from 0.05 to 10�5, undo.SD ranging from 0 to 5, and min.width ranging from 2 to 5, and calculated a BIC score for each.
We also tested the performance of each segmentation using a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve to determine the param-
eters at which sensitivity was maximized and false positive CNVs were minimized (Figure S1J). We concluded that the best param-
eters for segmentation were alpha = 0.001, undo.SD = 0, and min.width = 5.
We later simulated data based on 6 additional cells to assess the effect of our BIC and CNV thresholds on false positives and false
negatives using ALT and NULL model simulations as described above (Figure S2B-C).
RepeatMasker analysis of outlier bins
To see if outlier bins showed any differences in genomic features compared to normal bins, we selected 100 outlier bins and 100
normal bins of similar size and calculated base overlap with RepeatMasker (UCSC) feature types, such as LINE, SINE, simple repeats,
long terminal repeats, etc. Following normalization of overlapping bases by bin size, we performed a Wilcoxon rank-sum test for each
RepeatMasker feature type to test whether there was a difference in the fraction of overlapping bases between the bin groups.
RepeatMasker enrichment analysis of CNVs
To check for overlap of genomic features in the CNVs that we detected, we selected a subsample of CNVs corresponding to the 5th,
25th, 50th, 75th, and 95th percentiles of CNV size and used Bedtools shuffle (Quinlan and Hall, 2010) to generate 1000 randomized
genomic locations for each CNV. We then computed the percent overlap of each simulated CNV with RepeatMasker (UCSC) feature
types. From this, we computed the mean and standard deviation percent overlap of the randomized CNVs which we used to calculate
a z-score associated with the actual overlap as a function of CNV size. We also checked for border region enrichment by calculating
the percent overlap of RepeatMasker feature types with the first and last megabase of each simulated CNV and deriving the asso-
ciated z-score of the actual CNV border overlap as a function of CNV size.
Gene set enrichment
To explore the biological significance of large scale CNVs in the brain, we sought to follow up on the work of two papers that identified
lists of long genes that may be predisposed to DNA breaks in mice (King et al., 2013; Wei et al., 2016). Building upon this idea, we
also examined a third list containing the 50 longest human genes obtained using biomaRt (Smedley et al., 2015). These gene
lists shared genes in common with one another. There were ultimately seven gene lists drawn from one, two, or three of the original
lists, as well as an eighth gene list containing all 93 genes gathered from all three sources. To test for enrichment, we collected
hotspot coordinates corresponding to a minimum number of CNV events, which varied depending on the subset of data being
tested and the CNV threshold used. For each data subset, we set hotspot cutoffs for the required number of CNVs such that no cutoff
should lead to greater than 20% coverage of the human genome. The resulting cutoffs for each subset and threshold are listed in the
table below:

 For each set of hotspots, we randomly shuffled the hotspot loci within the genome 10,000 times to generate a null model of CNV
coverage. We then determined the number of genes of interest found in the actual hotspots and the range of genes of interest found in
the null model to generate enrichment p values, which were then FDR-corrected using the Benjamini-Hochberg method. Owing to the
considerable inter-dependence among hotspot sets being tested, these p values were FDR-corrected within stratified sub-groups;
for example, p values for hotspots derived from individuals were corrected separately from p values for hotspots derived from age
groups. Likewise, p values for hotspots defined as regions of 3-5 CNVs were corrected separately from regions defined as regions of
2-5, 4-5, or 5 CNVs.
Gene Ontology (GO) term analysis
We compiled a list of genes with genomic coordinates overlapping each CNV and separated these lists by individual and, where
applicable, cell type. These lists of CNV-affected genes were submitted to PANTHER (Mi et al., 2013) (pantherdb.org) to determine
if any GO terms were enriched. The resulting GO terms and corresponding p values were then submitted to REViGO (Supek et al.,
2011) (revigo.irb.hr) to aid visualization via downloadable plotting scripts.
QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Most statistical analyses were performed using R (version 3.4.1, www.R-project.org), utilizing base and downloaded packages. BIC
score cutoffs and CNV thresholds were defined as explained in Method Details. Statistical tests and outlier detection are explained in
figure legends and in Results text. Stratification of p value correction in gene set enrichment is described above in Method Details.
Statistical significance was defined as p < 0.05.
