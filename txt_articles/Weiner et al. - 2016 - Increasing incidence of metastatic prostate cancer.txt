Increasing incidence of metastatic prostate cancer in the
United States (2004–2013)
AB Weiner1, RS Matulewicz1, SE Eggener2 and EM Schaeffer1
BACKGROUND: Changes in prostate cancer screening practices in the United States have led to recent declines in overall
incidence, but it is unknown whether relaxed screening has led to changes in the incidence of advanced and metastatic prostate
cancer at diagnosis.
METHODS: We identified all men diagnosed with prostate cancer in the National Cancer Data Base (2004–2013) at 1089 different
health-care facilities in the United States. Joinpoint regressions were used to model annual percentage changes (APCs) in the
incidence of prostate cancer based on stage relative to that of 2004.
RESULTS: The annual incidence of metastatic prostate cancer increased from 2007 to 2013 (Joinpoint regression: APC: 7.1%,
Po0.05) and in 2013 was 72% more than that of 2004. The incidence of low-risk prostate cancer decreased from years 2007 to
2013 (APC: − 9.3%, Po0.05) to 37% less than that of 2004. The greatest increase in metastatic prostate cancer was seen in men
aged 55–69 years (92% increase from 2004 to 2013).
CONCLUSIONS: Beginning in 2007, the incidence of metastatic prostate cancer has increased especially among men in the age
group thought most likely to benefit from definitive treatment for prostate cancer. These data highlight the continued need for
nationwide refinements in prostate cancer screening and treatment.

INTRODUCTION
Over the past decade, there has been substantial shifts in PSA
screening practices in response to randomized trial data and US
Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendations in 2008
and 2012.1,2 This has resulted in reduced screening with
associated declines in overall prostate cancer incidence.3,4 Using
data from a large cancer registry from 2004 through 2013, we
sought to analyze the temporal relationship between relaxed
screening and increases in yearly incidence of advanced or
metastatic prostate cancer.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
From the National Cancer Data Base (NCDB), all men diagnosed with
adenocarcinoma of the prostate (International Classification of Diseases for
Oncology histology codes 8550 and 8140) from 2004 through 2013 were
included. Only patients with data available to risk stratify based on
National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines were included
(low risk: cT1cT2a, PSA o10 ng ml − 1 and Gleason score ⩽ 6; intermediate
risk: cT2b–T2c, PSA 10–20 ng ml − 1 and Gleason score 7; high risk: cT3–4,
PSA ⩾ 20 ng ml − 1 and Gleason score 8–10; metastatic cN1 or cM1).5 To
avoid bias in temporal trends, the analysis was limited to facilities that
contributed prostate cancer patient data each year during the study
period. After those facilities were excluded, a total of 767 550 patients from
1089 facilities were analyzed.
The primary outcome was annual incidence of prostate cancer based on
NCCN risk groups relative to that of 2004. That is, the outcome
denominator was the incidence in 2004 and the numerator was the
incidence for every year after. Patients were considered to have metastatic
prostate cancer if they were found to have clinically nodal or distant
metastases (cN1 or cM1) at the time of diagnosis. To model temporal
trends in incidence, Joinpoint software 4.2.0.2 (http://surveillance.cancer.
gov/joinpoint/) was used to estimate annual percent changes (APCs) in
incidence relative to 2004 and to identify significant changes in the linear
slope of annual prostate cancer incidence stratified by individual risk
and age groups. A two-sided Po0.05 was used to determine whether
APCs were statistically significant. The Mann–Whitney U-test was used to
compare annual median diagnostic PSA values among men with
metastatic prostate cancer. This study of de-identified, publicly available
data was determined to be exempt by the Northwestern University
Institutional Review Board.
RESULTS
Of the 767 550 men with prostate cancer included in our study,
3% had metastases at diagnosis. The remainder had localized
disease: 32% low, 45% intermediate and 20% high risk (Table 1).5
Relative to 2004, the annual incidence of all prostate cancer did
not change significantly over time (Figure 1 and Table 1). The
incidence of low-risk prostate cancer decreased from years 2007
to 2013 (Joinpoint regression, APC: − 9.3%, Po0.05) to 37% less
than that of 2004 (25 708 cases in 2004 to 16 223 in 2013). Inter-
mediate-risk prostate cancer increased from 2004 to 2008 (APC:
10.0%, Po0.05) and did not change significantly in the following
years (APC − 2.7%, P = 0.3). The incidence of intermediate-risk
prostate cancer was 23% more in 2013 compared with 2004.
Similarly, the incidence of high-risk prostate cancer rose from 2004
to 2008 and declined thereafter, although these changes were not
statistically significant. Conversely, the incidence of metastatic
prostate cancer rose from 2007 to 2013 (APC: 7.1%, Po0.05)
increasing to 72% more than that of 2004 (1685 cases in 2004 to
2890 in 2013).

 The increasing incidence of metastatic prostate cancer was
statistically significantly in all age groups with the largest increase
seen in men aged 55 to 69 years from 702 cases in 2004 to 1345
in 2013 (92% increase; Figure 2 and Table 2). Whereas median
PSA levels among men diagnosed with localized disease were
stable over the study period (6.1 ng ml − 1 (interquartile range (IQR)
4.5–9.6 ng ml − 1)
to
6.2 ng ml − 1
(IQR
4.6–9.6 ng ml − 1)),
the
median PSA levels among men with metastatic prostate cancer
increased from 25.5 ng ml − 1 (IQR 10.4–67.5 ng ml − 1) in 2004 to
49.7 ng ml − 1 (IQR 14.3–98.0 ng ml − 1) in 2013 (Po0.001).
DISCUSSION
Since 2007, the incidence of metastatic prostate cancer has risen
significantly
whereas
that
of
low-risk
prostate
cancer
has
simultaneously fallen. The largest increase in metastatic prostate
cancer was seen among the age group (55–69 years) thought to
benefit most from prostate cancer screening and early definitive
treatment.6 These findings cannot be explained completely by
reactions to the USPSTF recommendations alone, as increases in
metastatic prostate cancer began in the years before its release.
Changes in aggregate screening before the USPSTF grade D
recommendation, alterations in the biological aggressiveness of
prostate cancer or increases in the ascertainment of metastatic
disease (through increased sensitivity and utilization of imaging)
are plausible explanations. Although the latter is possible, it seems
less likely given increased imaging would discover metastases in
more men with lower PSAs and we noted the opposite, a
simultaneous increase in PSAs among men with metastatic
prostate cancer.
Although the social and biologic factors underlying these PSA
escapes and rising metastatic prostate cancer cases are unknown,
the implications of these recent trends highlight the continued

 need for nationwide refinements in prostate cancer screening and
treatment to prevent the morbidity and mortality associated with
metastatic prostate cancer. This will be particularly critical for
population health economics in the United States considering the
added cost of care for metastatic prostate cancer7 and an aging
constituency whose population over the age 65 years will
double to over a projected 80 million by the year 2050.8
In addition, our findings and forthcoming changes in the number
of
elderly
individuals
should
provide
impetus
to
improve
treatments for men with metastatic prostate cancer whose
cancer-specific survival has not changed significantly in the past
two decades.9
Data from the NCDB also demonstrated an increase in the
incidence of intermediate-risk prostate cancer in the early years of
the study period. This likely reflects grade migration because of
modifications in the Gleason Grading system in 2005 by the
International Society of Urologic Pathology leading to Gleason 6
cancers being upgraded.10 Declines seen in low-risk prostate
cancer incidence following the year 2007 likely reflects changes in
aggregate screening after the 2008 USPSTF recommendation
against screening for the elderly.1
Limitations to the current study include the lack of national
annual incidence rates in the NCDB. Thus, our outcome variable
was annual incidence of prostate cancer at over 1000 health-care
facilities in the United States relative to that of 2004, the initial
year of our study period. However, given the large number of
patients and health-care facilities analyzed, it is likely that trends in
the NCDB reflect national patterns.
