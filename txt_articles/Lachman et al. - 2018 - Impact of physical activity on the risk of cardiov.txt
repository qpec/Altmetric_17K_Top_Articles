Abstract
Background: There is broad consensus that regular physical activity yields major health benefits. However, current
guidelines on physical activity are mainly aimed at middle-aged adults. It is unclear whether physical activity also translates
into cardiovascular health benefits in older adults. Therefore, we aimed to compare the association between different
levels of physical activity and the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in elderly to middle-aged individuals.
Methods: We analysed data from the EPIC Norfolk prospective population study. Cox proportional hazards models
were used to analyse the association between physical activity levels and time to CVD events in three age categories
(<55, 55–65 and >65 years). Interaction between age categories and physical activity levels was assessed.
Results: Analyses were based on 24,502 study participants aged 39–79 years. A total of 5240 CVD events occurred
during 412,954 person-years follow-up (median follow-up was 18.0 years). Among individuals aged over 65 years, hazard
ratios for CVD were 0.86 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.78–0.96), 0.87 (95% CI 0.77–0.99) and 0.88 (95% CI 0.77–1.02)
in moderately inactive, moderately active and active people, respectively, compared to inactive people. Among people
aged 55–65 and less than 55 years, the associations were directionally similar, but not statistically significant. The
interaction term between physical activity levels and age categories was not significant (P ¼ 0.38).
Conclusion: The inverse association between physical activity and the risk of CVD was significant in elderly and
comparable with middle-aged individuals. In addition, we observed that modest levels of physical activity confer benefits
in terms of CVD risk, compared to being completely inactive.

Introduction
In the early 1960s, Morris investigated the association
between physical activity (PA) and cardiovascular dis-
ease (CVD) prevalence.1 Since then, many studies have
confirmed that PA is associated with major health
benefits.2–5 However, despite accumulating evidence
of health benefits from PA, there is a worldwide trend
towards a more sedentary lifestyle and less PA.6,7 In
many western countries, the population is ageing rap-
idly,8 with profound consequences for public health.
Elderly people may have more difficulty engaging in
PA compared to middle-aged adults due to frailty and
comorbidity. Several recent guidelines and initiatives
have recommended more engagement in PA in order
to
improve
public
health.9–12

 Organization (WHO) stated that substantial health
benefits can be achieved by moderate intensity PA of
at least 150 minutes a week, or vigorous intensity PA of
at least 75 minutes a week, or any combination of mod-
erate and vigorous intensity PA.9 However, it is also
emphasised that any amount of PA leads to health
benefits.
Current PA guidelines are mainly aimed at middle-
aged individuals. It is less well established whether dif-
ferent PA intensities also translate into cardiovascular
health benefits in elderly people. We hypothesised that
elderly individuals benefit equally from PA compared
to middle-aged individuals regarding the risk of CVD.
We tested this hypothesis in the European Prospective
Investigation into Cancer (EPIC) Norfolk prospective
population study.
Methods
The EPIC Norfolk cohort is a prospective population
study, which is part of the 10-country collaborative
EPIC study. The design, methods and baseline charac-
teristics have been described previously.13 The cohort
was primarily designed to assess dietary and other
determinants of cancer, yet additional data were
obtained to investigate determinants of other chronic
diseases, particularly CVD. Participants aged 39–79
years were recruited from registries of general practices
in the area of Norfolk, and completed a detailed health
and lifestyle questionnaire at the baseline survey
between 1993 and 1997. They underwent standardised
physical examination and blood samples were obtained.
Measurements were performed by trained nurses. PA
was assessed using a questionnaire to quantify activities
in occupational and leisure time domains, and was cate-
gorised into four levels: active, moderately active, mod-
erately
inactive
and
inactive,
see
Supplementary
material. The PA questionnaire has been validated
against estimated energy expenditure from individually
calibrated heart rate monitoring.14,15 Standardised
measurements were obtained for body mass index
(BMI), blood pressure and serum total cholesterol.
Smoking status was derived from questionnaires.13
Hospitalisation or death from cardiovascular events
was
identified
if
the
corresponding
International
Classification of Disease (ICD)-10 code was recorded
as the underlying cause of hospitalisation or mortality.
Hospitalisations were identified by linking the partici-
pant’s unique National Health Service number with the
East Norfolk Health Authority (ENCORE) database.
The ENCORE database identifies all hospital contacts
throughout
England
and
Wales
for
residents
of
Norfolk. Death certificates were coded by trained nos-
ologists according to the ICD-10. Deaths or hospital-
isations were attributed to coronary heart disease
(CHD) if the underlying cause was coded as ICD-10
codes 120–125, which encompass the clinical spectrum
of CHD including unstable angina, stable angina and
myocardial infarction. Deaths or hospitalisations were
attributed to stroke if the underlying cause was coded
as ischaemic (I63) or haemorrhagic stroke (I60–62).
CVD was defined as either CHD or stroke. The
follow-up was censored on 31 March 2015. The study
protocol was approved by the Norwich District Health
Authority Ethics Committee. All participants gave
written informed consent.
Statistical analysis
Study participants with missing data for PA and those
who had prevalent CHD or stroke at baseline were
excluded from this analysis. Descriptive data were pre-
sented as a percentage and frequency for categorical
variables, as mean and standard deviation for continu-
ous variables with a normal distribution, and as median
with interquartile range for continuous variables with a
non-normal distribution. Age was categorised into
three categories: less than 55 years, 55–65 years and
over 65 years. A Cox proportional hazards model was
used to assess the association between the PA cate-
gories and the risk of cardiovascular events in all
three age categories. Hazard ratios (HRs) and corres-
ponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for time to the
occurrence of cardiovascular events were calculated for
study participants classified as active, moderately active
and moderately inactive, using those classified as inac-
tive as the reference category. Analyses were performed
for total CVD events (i.e. CHD and stroke combined).
HRs were calculated according to an unadjusted regres-
sion model as well as model 2 that was adjusted for
socioeconomic status which was based on social class
(professionals, managerial and technical occupations,
non-manual skilled workers, manual skilled workers,
partly skilled workers and unskilled workers), age, sex
and smoking status (current, former or never), and
model 3 that was adjusted for socioeconomic status,
age, sex, smoking status, systolic blood pressure, dia-
betes, BMI, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol
and
high-density
lipoprotein
(HDL)
cholesterol.
Interactions between PA and age, and PA and sex
were tested by including the relevant parameters in
the Cox regression model. The attributable risk fraction
was based on the following calculation: incidence of
CVD (exposed*) – incidence CVD (active)/incidence
of CVD (exposed*). Exposed was defined by PA
levels inactive or moderately inactive or moderately
active. In order to assess the shape of the relationship
between PA categories and the hazard of CVD, we used
a log-likelihood ratio test to compare Cox regression
models assuming a (log-)linear association of PA
Lachman et al.
201
 category, and allowing a different association for each
category compared with the inactive group. A signifi-
cant difference between the fit of the two models was
assumed to support departure from a (log-)linear rela-
tionship between PA categories and the hazard of
CVD. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS
version 23 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). A P value
less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Results
The EPIC Norfolk cohort comprised 25,639 study par-
ticipants. A total of 1136 (4%) were excluded because
of prevalent CHD or stroke or prevalent CHD and
stroke or missing data in any of the two, and a further
one had missing PA data. Thus 24,502 study partici-
pants were available for the current analysis. Median
(interquartile) follow-up was 18.0 years, yielding a total
of 412,954 person-years follow-up. A total of 4450
(18.2%) participants experienced a CHD event during
follow-up, 1231 (5.0%) experienced a stroke event, and
441 (1.8%) experienced both a CHD and a stroke
event. Thus, a CVD event occurred in 5240 study
participants.
The characteristics of the EPIC Norfolk participants
are presented in Table 1. In Table 2 the baseline
characteristics of participants are presented by PA
levels
and
age
categories.
The
participants’
ages
ranged between 39 and 79 years, and 44.1% were
men. The mean (� standard deviation) age in age cate-
gories under 55, 55–65 and over 65 years were 49 � 3,
60 � 3, and 70 � 3 years, respectively.
In Table 3, the rate of CVD is presented by PA
categories. During follow-up there were 874, 1650 and
2716 CVD events in participants aged under 55, 55–65
and over 65 years, respectively. In age category less
than 55 years, the adjusted HRs for CVD according
to Cox regression model 3 were 0.95 (95% CI 0.76–
1.18) for active participants, 0.85 (95% CI 0.69–1.05)
for moderately active participants and 1.03 (95% CI
0.84–1.26) for moderately inactive participants, com-
pared to inactive participants. In age category 55–65
years, the adjusted HRs were 0.84 (95% CI 0.72–
0.99), 0.99 (95% 0.86–1.14) and 0.89 (95% CI 0.77–
1.02) for active, moderately active and moderately inac-
tive participants, respectively. In age category over 65
years, the adjusted HRs for CVD events were 0.88
(95% CI 0.77–1.02), 0.87 (95% CI 0.77–0.99) and
0.86 (95% CI 0.78–0.96) for active, moderately active
and moderately inactive participants, respectively, com-
pared to inactive participants. When data analysis was
only based on CHD, the adjusted HRs for CVD

 remained significant (see Supplementary Table 1a).
Supplementary Figure 1 illustrates the incidence rate
of CVD in all age categories. The interactions between
PA and age and between PA and sex were each not
significant (P values 0.38 and 0.75, respectively), sug-
gesting that the relationship between PA levels and
CVD risk did not differ between age categories (<55,
55–65, >65 years), nor between men and women.
There was no statistical evidence for a better fit of
the regression model using discrete PA categories
versus test for linear trend across categories in both
Cox regression models 2 and 3 (–2 log likelihood dif-
ference 3.83 and 3.48; P values 0.15 and 0.18, respect-
ively), when adjusted for socioeconomic status. There
was statistical evidence of a threshold (2 log likelihood
difference 6.96, P value 0.03, when not adjusted for
socioeconomic status (data shown in Supplementary
Table 1b).
Discussion
In this analysis among apparently healthy participants
of the EPIC Norfolk prospective population study, eld-
erly people appeared to benefit at least comparably
from PA compared to middle-aged individuals regard-
ing the risk of CVD. Secondly, we observed that even
those participants who were moderately inactive had a
substantially lower CVD risk than those who were
completely
inactive,
suggesting
that
even
modest
engagement in PA may be associated with a substan-
tially lower risk of CVD in the elderly.9–11 These obser-
vations are consistent with, but also extend on, the
findings from a previous analysis in EPIC Norfolk,
but in that analysis, participants were only stratified
into groups under 65 and over 65 years of age, and
the number of CVD events was lower due to a shorter
follow-up compared to the current analysis (average 8
vs. 16.9 years).16
As expected, we observed that elderly people had
lower levels of PA and higher CVD event rates com-
pared to middle-aged individuals. However, a direc-
tionally similar inverse association between PA and
CVD risk was observed in all age categories. Health
benefits from PA in middle-aged and older individuals
have previously been demonstrated. Among 267,153
people enrolled in the ‘45 and up study’ there was an
inverse association between PA and all-cause mortality
in the age categories 45–54 and 55–64 years. The asso-
ciation between PA and mortality among elderly people
(65–75 years) was not statistically significant. However,
there was no statistical evidence for a difference
between the age categories (P value for interaction

 >0.05).17 In the National Cancer Institute Cohort
Consortium of six population studies, there was an
inverse association between PA and the risk of mortal-
ity among all age groups (<50, 50–59, 60–69, >70
years). There was statistical evidence for a difference
between
age
categories
(P
value
for
interaction
<0.001) but, if anything, the association between PA
and mortality was stronger rather than weaker among
those aged over 70 years old, which is consistent with
our findings for CVD. However, Gulsvik et al. observed
in a large cohort of 42 years’ follow-up that the popu-
lation attributable fraction of no/low activity was con-
sistent across all age groups.18 In the current study, we
observed that the decreased risk of CVD associated
with PA was not as pronounced as reported by
Soares-Miranda et al.,19 who found a significantly
lower risk (by 51% and 70%, respectively) in individ-
uals under 75 years and 75 years and over engaging in
the highest intensity exercise.
We observed that the shape of the PA–CVD risk
relationship does not appear to have a threshold
when
it
was
adjusted
for
socioeconomic
status.
However, when no adjustment for socioeconomic
status was done, the shape of the PA–CVD risk rela-
tionship appears to have a threshold such that the lar-
gest step in terms of CVD risk is seen in completely
inactive and moderately inactive people, which is con-
sistent with the international consensus that ‘any PA is
better than none at all’. Soares-Miranda et al. observed
that low intensity exercise compared to no exercise
intensity at all was associated with a significantly
lower CVD risk among individuals aged 75 years and
older.19 Higher intensity PA levels yielded a compar-
ably lower risk. Similar findings were reported by other
large cohort studies. A pooled analysis from six studies
comprising a total of 661,137 individuals showed that
individuals engaging in any leisure time activity had a
20% lower mortality compared to individuals who did
not
report
any
PA
across
all
age
categories.20
Furthermore, a combined analysis of the Harvard
Alumni Health Study and the Women’s Health Study
demonstrated that vigorous PA was not associated with
lower CVD mortality risk compared to moderate inten-
sity PA.21 These findings indicate that health benefits
are not restricted to those engaging in vigorous inten-
sity PA, but that individuals exercising at lower inten-
sity may also benefit. In our study we investigated total
PA levels, not PA intensity. However, we observed that
people doing some PA compared to being completely
inactive had a lower CVD risk.
As there appeared to be a threshold between com-
pletely inactive and moderately inactive people in the
relationship between PA and CVD risk, the avoidance
of
a
sedentary
lifestyle
in
general
should
be
recommended. The association between PA and CVD
risk was maintained at low levels of PA in age cate-
gories 55–65 and over 65 years. These observations sug-
gest that in order to achieve cardiovascular health
benefits from PA, elderly people should be encouraged
to engage in at least some PA of low level. Huang et al.
demonstrated that aerobic training in healthy sedentary
elderly
people
yielded
cardiorespiratory
benefits.22
However, elderly people with mobility impairment
may be unable to meet the current PA recommenda-
tions; the benefits of low levels of PA may be of par-
ticular relevance to this group. Fitzgerald et al. reported
that sedentary elderly people with mobility impairment
also benefit from engagement in PA.23 In their cross-
sectional analysis, objectively measured PA with an
accelerometer was inversely associated with the calcu-
lated risk of cardiac events. In general, health benefits
can be achieved by changing a sedentary lifestyle into a
more active lifestyle in all age categories.24
Our study has several strengths. First, this analysis
included a large proportion of individuals aged 65 years
and older (n ¼ 7467) with a long duration of follow-up,
which allows us to observe a relatively large population
of older age. Secondly, in EPIC Norfolk PA levels were
derived from leisure time and work-related activities.
Individuals could be engaged in different activities
across the major life domains including leisure, occu-
pation and transport. Daily PA may be underestimated
if PA quantification is based on activities derived from
only one life domain. Some limitations of our study
should also be considered. PA was assessed by self-
report, which is imprecise relative to more objective
measurement tools. However, the PA questionnaire in
EPIC Norfolk was validated against energy expend-
iture assessed by individually calibrated heart-rate
monitoring.14,15
Notably, CVD events were exclusively based on ICD
codes of the hospital discharge ENCORE register or
the ICD death certification codes, and were not clinic-
ally
validated
events.
Furthermore,
our
analysis
included participants from 39 years of age and older,
younger participants were not represented in the pre-
sent analysis. However, health benefits are obtained by
the maintenance of a physically active lifestyle that is
adopted at young age.24–26
Conclusion
Our findings in the EPIC Norfolk population support
current international guidelines and recommendations
on PA including middle-aged and elderly people. In all
age groups, even a little engagement in PA of moderate
inactive level and not necessarily PA of vigorous level
was associated with a substantially lower CVD risk

 compared to no PA at all; however, when adjusted for
socioeconomic status this is only observed in elderly
people. A broader array of public health, healthcare
systems and communities should be involved in helping
elderly people to engage in any PA of any level and to
reduce a sedentary lifestyle.
