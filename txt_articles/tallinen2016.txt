The rapid growth of the human cortex during development is
accompaniedbythefoldingofthebrainintoahighlyconvoluted
structure1–3. Recent studies have focused on the genetic and
cellular regulation of cortical growth4–8, but understanding
the formation of the gyral and sulcal convolutions also
requires consideration of the geometry and physical shaping
of the growing brain9–15. To study this, we use magnetic
resonance images to build a 3D-printed layered gel mimic
of the developing smooth fetal brain; when immersed in a
solvent, the outer layer swells relative to the core, mimicking
cortical growth. This relative growth puts the outer layer into
mechanical compression and leads to sulci and gyri similar to
those in fetal brains. Starting with the same initial geometry,
we also build numerical simulations of the brain modelled
as a soft tissue with a growing cortex, and show that this
also produces the characteristic patterns of convolutions over
a realistic developmental course. All together, our results
show that although many molecular determinants control the
tangential expansion of the cortex, the size, shape, placement
and orientation of the folds arise through iterations and
variations of an elementary mechanical instability modulated
by early fetal brain geometry.
The convoluted shape of the human cerebral cortex is the result
of gyrification that begins after mid-gestation1,2 (Fig. 1a); before the
sixth month of fetal life, the cerebral surface is smooth. The first
sulci appear as short isolated lines or triple junctions during the
sixth month. These primary sulci soon elongate and branch, and
secondary and tertiary sulci form, resulting in a complex pattern
of gyri and sulci at birth. Some new sulci develop after birth,
further complicating the pattern. Although the course and patterns
of gyrification vary across individuals, the primary gyri and sulci
have characteristic locations and orientations16.
Gyrification is, however, not unique to humans, and also exists
in a range of primates and other species17,18. It has evolved as an
efficient way of packing a large cortex into a relatively small skull
with natural advantages for information processing17,19. Thus,
although the functional rationale for gyrification is clear, the
physiological mechanism behind gyrification has been unclear.
Hypotheses
include
gyrogenetic
theories4,20
proposing
that
biochemical prepatterning of the cortex controls the rise of gyri,
and the axonal tension hypothesis21 proposing that axons in white
matter beneath the cortex draw together densely interconnected
cortical regions to form gyri. There is, however, no evidence of
prepatterning that matches gyral patterns, nor is there evidence
of axonal tension driving gyrification10. At present, the most
likely hypothesis is also the simplest one: tangential expansion
of the cortical layer relative to sublayers generates compressive
stress, leading to the mechanical folding of the cortex9–15,22–25. This
mechanical folding model produces realistic sizes and shapes of
gyral and sulcal patterns15 that are presumably modulated by brain
geometry26, but the hypothesis has not been tested before with real
three-dimensional (3D) fetal brain geometries in a developmental
setting. Here we substantiate and quantify this notion using both
physical and numerical models of the brain, guided by the use of
3D magnetic resonance images (MRI) of a smooth fetal brain as a
starting point.
We construct a physical simulacrum of brain folding by
taking advantage of the observation that soft physical gels swell
superficially when immersed in solvents. This swelling relative to
the interior puts the outer layers of the gel into compression, yielding
surface folding patterns qualitatively similar to sulci and gyri15. An
MRI image of a smooth fetal brain at gestational week (GW) 22
(Fig. 1b; see Supplementary Methods) serves as a template for a
3D-printed cast of the brain. A mould of this form allows us to
create a gel-brain (mimicking the white matter) that is then coated
with a thin layer of elastomer gel (mimicking the cortical grey
matter layer). When this composite gel is immersed in a solvent
(see Supplementary Methods) it swells starting at the surface; this
leads to superficial compression and the progressive formation
of cusped sulci and smooth gyri in the cortex similar in both
morphology and relative timing to those seen in real brains (Fig. 1c
and Supplementary Movie 1). We note that although the mechanical
creasing or sulcification instability is due to the swelling-induced
compression, the effect is convoluted by the complex curvature of
the initial shape.
To obtain a more quantitative assessment of this process, we carry
out a numerical simulation of the developing brain constructed
using the same 3D fetal brain MRI (Fig. 1d) as an initial condition
for the growth of a soft elastic tissue model of the brain. The model
assumes that a cortical layer of thickness h is perfectly adhered to a
white matter core and grows with a prescribed tangential expansion
ratio g, with both tissues assumed to be soft neo-Hookean elastic
solids with similar elastic moduli (see Supplementary Methods).
Combining these facts with the known overall isometric growth
of the brain3 yields a differential-strain-based elastic model of
brain growth that we solve numerically using custom finite-element
methods15. For problem parameters, we note that from GW 22
to adulthood (Supplementary Fig. 1) there is an approximately

Figure 1 | Physical mimic and numerical simulation of tangential cortical expansion. a, Gyrification of the human brain during the latter half of gestation
(photographs from ref. 1, adapted with permission from Elsevier). b, A 3D-printed model of the brain is produced from a 3D MRI image of a smooth fetal
brain and then used to create a pair of negative silicone moulds for casting. To mimic the constrained growth of the cortex, a replicated gel-brain (white
matter) is coated with a thin layer of gel (cortex) that swells by absorbing a solvent (hexanes) over time t (t1 ≈4 min, t2 ≈9 min, t3 ≈16 min). c, The layered
gel progressively evolves into a complex pattern of sulci and gyri during the swelling process. d, A simulation starting from a smooth fetal brain shows
gyrification as a result of uniform tangential expansion of the cortical layer. The brain is modelled as a soft elastic solid and a relative tangential expansion is
imposed on the cortical layer as shown at left, and the system allowed to relax to its elastic equilibrium.
20-fold increase in brain volume (approximately 60 ml to 1,200 ml),
and a 30-fold increase in cortical area (approximately 80 cm2 to
2,400 cm2), whereas the expanding cortical layer changes little, with
a typical thickness of 2.5 mm in the undeformed reference state
(the deformed thickness is about 3 mm). In physiological terms,
we thus assume that tangential expansion during the fetal stage
extends through the cortical plate (which has a thickness of about
1–1.5 mm at GW 22) and decays rapidly in the subplate (Fig. 1d,
left). The subplate diminishes during gyrification while the cortical
plate thickens and develops into the cerebral cortex1,3, so that in
the simulated adult brain the expanding layer corresponds to the
cerebral cortex (which is about 3 mm thick in adults).
Our simple parametrization of brain growth leads to emergence
of gyrification in space and time along a course similar to real
brains (Fig. 1d and Supplementary Movie 2): gyrification is initiated
through the formation of isolated line-like sulci (GW 26), which
elongate and branch, establishing most of the patterns before birth
(GW 40). After birth, brain volume still increases nearly threefold,
and during this time our model shows that the gyral patterns are
modified mainly by the addition of some new bends to existing
gyri in agreement with longitudinal morphological analyses27. The
characteristic spatiotemporal appearance of these convolutions—
rounded gyri between sharply cusped sulci in a mixture of threefold
junctions and S-shaped bends28—is a direct consequence of the
mechanical instability induced by constrained cortical expansion.
Physically, the similar stiffness of the cortex and sublayers implies
that gyrification arises as a non-trivial combination of a smooth
linear instability29 and a nonlinear sulcification instability30–32.
Sections of the physically and numerically simulated brains
shown in Fig. 2a,b exhibit a bulging of gyri and deepening of sulci
in a sequence resembling the observations from MRI sections. Our
simulations of gyrification driven by constrained cortical expansion
allow us to also measure the gyrification index (GI, defined as
the ratio of the surface contour length to that of the convex hull,
determined here from coronal sections as described in ref. 3). We
see that there is a clear increase in the GI with developing brain
volume in agreement with observations (Fig. 2c). The GI arising
from our numerical simulation reaches 2.5, matching observations
of adult brains. A different measure of the GI based on the cortical
surface area rather than that of sections shows that the simulated
adult brain has a cortical area that is approximately four times the
exposed cortical area (Supplementary Fig. 1). For comparison, we
also section our physical gel simulacrum that swells from an initial
unpatterned state (GI = 1.07, GW 22) and see that as a function
of swelling, the GI increases to about 1.55, a modest increase
associated with an approximately twofold increase in brain volume,
the latter state corresponding to roughly GW 30–34 (Fig. 2c and
Supplementary Fig. 2). The ultimate limiting factor in our physical
experiments is the inability for our gel to swell and increase its
volume 20-fold like in fetal brains.

(right panels). b, The coronal sections of the simulated brain (top panels) with comparisons to corresponding MRI sections35,39. c, Gyrification index as a
function of brain size for real brains (data from refs 3,40), a numerically simulated brain, and a physical gel-brain. Gestational week is indicated for fetal
and children brains. The initial volume of the gel-brain (≈34 ml) is scaled to match that of the simulated brain (≈57 ml). Note that in the gel experiments
only the outer layer swells and therefore the volume grows less than in real brains.
Having seen that our physical and numerical experiments can
capture the overall qualitative picture of how gyri form, we now turn
to the question of the role of brain geometry and mechanical stresses
in controlling the placement and orientations of the major and
minor sulci and gyri. In Fig. 3a, we show the field of the simulated
compressive stress just before the primary sulci form. Although
cortical growth in our model is relatively uniform in space, the
curvature of the surface is not. This yields a non-uniform stress field
in the cortical layer. Thus, compressive stresses are reduced in the
vicinity of highly curved convex regions, so that the first sulci appear
at weakly curved or concave regions in our simulations, consistent
with observations in fetal brains1,16. Furthermore, compression-
induced sulci should favour their alignment perpendicular to the
largest compressive stress, and indeed directions of the largest
compressive stress in our model are perpendicular to the general
orientations of primary gyri and sulci (Fig. 3a). Figure 3b shows that
the first generations of sulci form perpendicular to the maximum
compressive stress in real and simulated model brains; this
correlation is particularly clear for the primary sulci in real brains.
Although the shape of the initially smooth fetal brain is
described by the curvature of its surface, cortical growth eventually
couples the curvature and mechanical stress in non-trivial ways.
In Supplementary Fig. 3 we compare the stress field and curvature
at the cortical surface just before the first sulci form, and see
that in highly curved regions the maximum compressive stress is
perpendicular to the highest (convex) curvature. However, this does
not hold at the ellipsoidal surfaces of the frontal and temporal
lobes; these lobes elongate and bend towards each other as a result
of cortical growth (Supplementary Fig. 3; Supplementary Movie 1
shows the analogue in our gel experiments). This reduces the
compressive stress in the direction of elongation and bending, which
in turn is reflected in the dominant orientations of the frontal and
temporal gyri.
Although the global brain shape directs the orientations of
the primary gyri, the finer details of the gyrification patterns are
sensitive to variations in the initial geometry. In Fig. 3c we see
that the patterns of gyri and sulci on a physical gel-brain exhibit
some deviations from perfect bilateral symmetry. The hemispheres
are not identical in real brains either, but we note that in our
models artefacts from imaging, surface segmentation, and sample
preparation can cause the two hemispheres to differ more than in
reality. The sequential patterns emerging from the folding (swelling)
and unfolding (drying) process also show some degree of variations
(Supplementary Fig. 4), but this process is highly repeatable; indeed,
the resulting gyral patterns are found to be robust and reproducible
on multiple repetition of the experiment with the same gel-brain
sample (lower left of Fig. 3c). The folding patterns vary in detail
across samples (Supplementary Fig. 4), but they share general

A simplified scheme of the human brain17 indicating the general orientations of sulci is shown at the top right. b, View of the first generations of sulci in a

fields of maximum compressive stress at GW 25 and show that most sulci form perpendicular to the direction of maximum compressive stress (solid and

similarities in terms of the alignment of sulci and gyri and the inter-
sulcal spacing. These experimentally derived findings corroborate
numerical results; in Supplementary Fig. 5 we see the extent of
variations associated with imperfections, by comparing the left and
right hemispheres of the simulated brain when the simulation has
been run forwards (folding) or backwards (unfolding) in time. In
Supplementary Fig. 6 we compare the simulated folding of two
different brains (starting from MRI images of different fetal brains)
and see that the patterns in both brains are consistent with the
scheme depicted in Fig. 3a.
We quantify our qualitative comparison of the similarities
between real and simulated brains in Fig. 4 using morphometric
techniques. Conformal mapping of the curvature vector fields (see
Supplementary Methods) allows for a visual (Fig. 4a) as well as
quantitative comparison (Fig. 4b), which indicates similar average
alignments of curvature fields, and thus folds, in both the simulated
and real brains. As a final comparison, in Fig. 4c,d we identify
visually many of the named primary gyri1 from the simulated brains
and compare to a real fetal brain at a similar stage, and note that our
simulations can capture many of the trends quantitatively.
All together, by combining physical experiments and numerical
simulations originating with initially smooth 3D fetal brain
geometries, we have quantified a simple mechanical folding scenario
for the development of convolutions in the fetal brain. Our physical
gel model shows that we can capture the qualitative features of
the folding patterns that are driven by a combination of surface
swelling and surface geometry, setting the stage for how biology
can build on this simple physical pattern-forming instability. Our
numerical model is fully quantitative, based on parameters that
are known by simple measurements: cortical thickness, white and
grey matter tissue stiffness, brain growth and relative tangential
expansion of the cortex. Together, they show that gyrification
is an inevitable mechanical consequence of constrained cortical
expansion; patterned gyri and sulci that are consistent with
observations arise even in the absence of any patterning of cortical
growth. Furthermore, although cortical expansion and brain shape
couple to guide placement and orientation of gyri, the finer details
of the patterns, on scales comparable to the cortical thickness,
are sensitive to geometrical and mechanical perturbations. Real
brains are likely to have small inter-individual variations in shape,
tissue properties and growth rates, and the sensitivity of mechanical
folding to such small variations could explain the variability
of gyrification patterns, although the primary convolutions are
consistently reproducible in their location and timing.
Our organ-level approach complements the recent emphases on
the many molecular determinants underlying neuronal cell size
and shape, as well patterns in their proliferation and migration4,24.
These variables are functions of time and space in the cortex

and the sub-ventricular zone, but ultimately feed into just two
physical parameters for a given initial brain shape: relative cortical
expansion and the ratio of cortical thickness/brain size15. By
grounding our study on observations of fetal brain development,
where these parameters are known, our work provides a quantitative
basis for the proximal biophysical cause of gyrification. Our
results can serve as a template for physically based morphometric
studies that characterize the developing geometry of the brain
surface33–35 in terms of variations in initial brain shape and cortical
expansion. Additionally, our study sets the biophysical basis for
an understanding of a range of functional neurological disorders
linked to structural cortical malformations4,36 that are associated
with neurogenesis and brain size (for example, ASPM and CENPJ
for microcephaly4,37) and cell migration and cortex thickness (for
example, GPR56 for polymicrogyria6 and RELN for lissencephaly38).
With this information, a natural next step is to link the molecular
determinants to the macroscopic mechanics quantitatively, and ask
how brain shape and function are mutually co-regulated.
