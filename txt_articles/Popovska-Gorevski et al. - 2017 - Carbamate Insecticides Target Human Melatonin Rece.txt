Abstract
Carbaryl (1-naphthyl methylcarbamate) and carbofuran (2,3-dihydro-2,2-dimethyl-7-benzofuranyl 
methylcarbamate) are among the most toxic insecticides, implicated in a variety of diseases 
including diabetes and cancer among others. Using an integrated pharmacoinformatics based 
screening approach, we have identified these insecticides to be structural mimics of the 
neurohormone melatonin and were able to bind to the putative melatonin binding sites in MT1 and 
MT2 melatonin receptors in silico. Carbaryl and carbofuran then were tested for competition with 
2-[125I]-iodomelatonin (300 pM) binding to hMT1 or hMT2 receptors stably expressed in CHO 
cells. Carbaryl and carbofuran showed higher affinity for competition with 2-[125I]-iodomelatonin 
binding to the hMT2 compared to the hMT1 melatonin receptor (33 and 35-fold difference, 
respectively) as predicted by the molecular modeling. In the presence of GTP (100 μM), which 
decouples the G-protein linked receptors to modulate signaling, the apparent efficacy of carbaryl 
and carbofuran for 2-[125I]-iodomelatonin binding for the hMT1 melatonin receptor was not 
affected but significantly decreased for the hMT2 melatonin receptor compatible with receptor 
antagonist/inverse agonist and agonist efficacy, respectively. Altogether, our data points to a 
potentially new mechanism through which carbamate insecticides carbaryl and carbofuran could 
impact human health by altering the homeostatic balance of key regulatory processes by directly 
binding to melatonin receptors.

 INTRODUCTION
The nightly release of melatonin from the pineal gland is regulated by biological clocks in 
the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus and transmits signals to the brain 
and peripheral target tissues through activation of the G-protein coupled melatonin receptors 
MT1 and/or MT2.1–3 Rhythmicity of pineal melatonin synthesis from serotonin is tightly 
orchestrated by N-acetyltransferase (AA-NAT) and hydroxyindole-o-methyltransferase 
(HIOMT) both of which have peak enzymatic activities during the night.4–6 Activation of 
melatonin receptors play a pivotal role in modulating the phase and amplitude of circadian 
rhythms phase and amplitude through the body.1,7,8 Circadian rhythm misalignment is 
implicated in various conditions such as jet lag, delayed sleep phase syndrome (DSPS), 
advanced sleep phase syndrome (ASPS), and seasonal affective disorders (SAD).9 
Activation of melatonin receptors inhibit cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) 
formation,10–13 regulate phosphorylation of the cAMP responsive element-binding protein 
(CREB),14 protein kinase activities,15,16 and ion fluxes.12,17 In essence, the melatonin 
receptor system regulates a wide-array of cellular signaling events essential to maintain 
rhythmicity and homeostatic balance of various regulatory processes.3,18 Aberrant melatonin 
receptor activation, sensitivity, and trafficking are linked to pathological conditions including 
cancer,19 diabetes,2,20 and cardiovascular disease.21
Exposure to chemicals that are structurally similar to melatonin can significantly alter this 
balance and could result in alteration of melatonin mediated signaling3 and potentially other 
conditions that impact human health. In the present study, innovative combinations of 
computational tools for chemical clustering of large data sets of environmental chemicals 
were employed in tandem with predictive three-dimensional models in an attempt to identify 
new-class of environmental neuroendocrine disruptors targeting melatonin receptors. Briefly, 
environmental chemicals that could potentially interact with melatonin receptors based on 
their structural similarity were identified using an integrated pharmacoinformatics screen 
from a comprehensive Chem2Risk knowledge-base. Molecular docking of select

 environmental modulators established novel bimolecular interactions of carbamate 
insecticides carbaryl and carbofuran with the MT1 and MT2 melatonin receptors in silico. 
Furthermore, the current study investigated ligand affinity, selectivity, and apparent intrinsic 
efficacy of selected environmental disruptors on hMT1 and hMT2 melatonin receptors in 
vitro.
Agricultural use of carbamates as insecticides is due to their strong yet reversible inhibitory 
effect on acetylcholinesterase.22 Occupational exposure to carbamates has been reported to 
be associated with psychological distress and depression among agricultural workers.23,24 
There is also a positive correlation between carbamate exposure and the risk of developing 
diabetes and metabolic syndrome.25 Carbaryl produces behavioral changes in rodents such 
as tremor26 and hypothermia.27 Furthermore, a recent study reports age-specific sensitivity 
to carbaryl in Brown-Norway rats indicative of age-related changes in metabolism. Even 
low-dose (3 mg/kg) carbaryl treatment exhibits these age-specific differences in both 
biochemical and behavioral experiments.28 While some of these effects were attributed to 
cholinesterase inhibition and neurotoxicity at higher doses, persistent exposure to lower 
doses of insecticides including carbamates in both occupational and nonoccupational 
environment was associated with increased risk of various disease conditions including 
diabetes, cancer, and depression.24,25 Center for Disease Control (CDC) reports that in 
addition to the dermal routes (the most common route of exposure), several classes of 
insecticides including the carbamates that are used in spray formulations can reach the brain 
and other target tissues via inhalation, circumventing liver metabolism (CDC ToxGuide, 
2003) and repeated exposure to these chemicals (as in occupational exposure) tend to render 
higher concentrations of insecticides in target tissues. It is imperative to find alternative 
targets and mechanisms through which carbamates and other insecticides render such a wide 
range of biochemical and behavioral effects.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Pharmacoinformatics. Chem2Risk, a curated pharmacoinformatics knowledgebase of about 
130,000 environmental chemicals with established 2D/3D structure coordinates was 
generated from US Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) aggregated computational 
toxicology resource (ACToR ~500,000 chemicals), ChEMBL (1 million chemicals),29 
STITCH3.0 (~300,000 chemicals),30 and CTD (12,000 chemicals)31 along with an in house 
knowledgebase of environmental agents (~170,000 chemicals). The ACToR database 
contains ToxREf, ToxCast DSSTox, and EpoCast databases and compounds from over 1000 
public sources and represents several years of in vitro and in vivo toxicity screening studies.
Chemical Similarity Clustering
Chemical similarities were computed using the Tanimoto coefficient, Dice’s coefficient, and 
Tversky index.32 Chemical clustering was performed using ChemMineR tools.33 The 
distance matrices were calculated by all-against-all comparisons of chemicals using atom 
pair similarity measures and transforming the generated similarity scores into distance 
values with respect to the seed molecule (melatonin).

 Molecular Docking of Environmental Melatonin Ligands
The strength of the chemical clustering was bolstered by in silico screening of potential 
environmental melatonin ligands against predictive theoretical models of melatonin 
receptors. Melatonin receptors hMT1 (350 residues) and hMT2 (362 residues) are seven 
transmembrane proteins connected via several intra- and extracellular loops, with 
approximately 60% overall sequence homology and 73% sequence homology in their 
transmembrane domains.3 None of the crystallized GPCR structures shares more than 30% 
sequence identity with melatonin receptors. The human β2 adrenergic receptor (hβ2AR) has 
34% and 32% sequence similarity with hMT1 and hMT2 melatonin receptors, respectively. 
The high resolution X-ray crystal structure of hβ2AR (PDB ID: 2RH1) was chosen as the 
template as it provides 82% (residue range 23–298) and 78% (residue range 36–324) 
sequence-structure coverage with MT1 and MT2, respectively. Several theoretical models of 
MT1 and MT2 were generated using Modeller9v8.34 The putative binding pockets for MT1 
(inclusive of residues H205, S110, and S112) and for MT2 (inclusive of residues N175, 
H208, N268, and Y298) were inferred from mutagenesis data.3 Melatonin receptor models 
were superimposed with the template, and initial orientations of putative binding site 
residues were visually inspected (Figure S1A). TM3 and TM5 of MT1 and MT2 models 
were refined based on a knowledge-based helical search as described by Akula and 
Pattabiraman.35 Stereochemical quality of the generated models was assessed using the 
PROCHECK application. PDB structures were prepared for molecular docking experiments 
using the protein structure preparation tool followed by Protonate3D as implemented in the 
Molecular Operating Environment (MOE, Chemical Computing Group Inc., Montreal, 
Canada). These structures were subjected to a short energy minimization routine to relax the 
structures using Amber 99 force field as implemented in MOE. Surflex-Dock (SYBYL, 
Cerata USA, Inc., Princeton, NJ), VINA (Autodock, Molecular Docking, The Scripps 
Research Institute), and MOE docking suite were employed to dock select environmental 
chemicals against human melatonin receptor models. A mini-library of 25 prototype 
melatonergic ligands with reported experimental binding affinities (ranging from 0.013 to 
307.35 nM) retrieved from G -Protein Ligand Database (GLIDA)36 were docked into MT1 
and MT2 receptor models. Melatonin receptor models with maximum number of ligand 
poses scoring similar or better than the cognate ligand melatonin and docked accurately into 
the putative melatonin binding pocket were chosen for further molecular docking 
experiments. Molecular visualization and graphics program Chimera was used to generate 
images.37

 Carbaryl (13 mM stock solution) was dissolved in ethanol, and carbofuran (13 mM stock 
solution) was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Carbaryl and carbofuran were next 
diluted to 1.3 mM in 50% ethanol/50% Tris-HCl buffer (50 mM and 10 mM MgCl2 at pH 
7.4 and 25 °C). Further dilutions were performed in Tris-HCl buffer. The ethanol or DMSO 
concentration in assays with 1 mM, 0.1 mM, or 0.01 mM carbamate compounds was 8%, 
4%, or 0.4% respectively, producing minimal inhibition of 2-[125I]-iodomelatonin binding 
when tested alone.
FLAG Tagging and Stable Transfection
The development of CHO-hMT1-FLAG and CHO-hMT2-FLAG stably expressing the 
human MT1 and MT2 melatonin receptor on the cell membrane was described previously.39 
Expression of melatonin receptors on the cell membrane is nicely visualized on cells 
transfected with either hMT1-GFP or hMT2-GFP (GFP: green fluorescent protein) showing 
significant membrane expression (see Figure 6 in ref 39).
Cell Culture
CHO cell cultures were grown as monolayers in Hem’s F12 media supplemented with 10% 
fetal calf serum, 1% penicillin (10,000 IU/mL)/streptomycin (10,000 μg/mL) in 5% CO2 at 
37 °C. CHO-MT1 and CHO-MT2 cells were grown for 4 days until 90–95% confluence was 
reached. Cells were washed with PBS on ice, lifted in potassium phosphate buffer (10 mM, 
pH 7.4) containing 0.25 M sucrose and 1 mM EDTA, and then pelleted by centrifugation 
(4000 rpm, 5 min). Pellets were stored at −80 °C until used.
2-[125I]-Iodomelatonin Binding Studies
Cell pellets were resuspended in 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4; 10 mM MgCl2), homogenized, 
pelleted, and washed by centrifugation (20,000–30,000g). 2-[125I]-Iodomelatonin binding 
was determined in cell membranes (5–10 μg protein/assay) as previously described.11 
Binding reactions were started by adding cell membranes to tubes containing binding buffer 
(50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mM MgCl2), 2-[125I]-iodomelatonin (SA:2200 Ci/mmol, 
PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA, USA) (300 pM) and appropriate concentrations of vehicle (20 
μL) or competing agents (20 μL) in a total assay volume of 0.26 mL. Following incubations 
for 1 h at 25 °C, reactions were terminated by rapid vacuum filtration through glass 
microfiber filters (Whatman, Krackeler Scientific, Inc., Albany NY, USA) soaked in 0.5% 
polyethylenimine solution. Filters were washed twice with 5 mL of ice-cold 50 mM Tris-
HCl, dried, and the radioactivity determined on a gamma counter.
GTP Shift Assay
Membrane pellets were resuspended in 50 mM Tris-HCl and 3 mM MgCl2, pH 7.4, to yield 
approximately 6–16 μg of protein/assay. 2-[125I]-Iodomelatonin (SA:2200 Ci/mmol, 
PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA, USA) binding was carried out as described above in Tris buffer 
(50 mM Tris-HCl and 10 mM MgCl2, pH 7.4), either in the absence or presence of 100 μM 
GTP, 1 mM EDTA, 150 mM NaCl, and appropriate concentrations of vehicle or competing 
agents [carbaryl (100 pM–1 mM) and carbofuran (100 pM – 1 mM)]. After 1 h of incubation

 at 25 °C, the reaction was terminated by rapid vacuum filtration and radioactivity measured 
as described above.
Data and Statistical Analysis
Competition curves were generated by nonlinear regression analysis using GraphPad Prism 
version 6 for Windows (GraphPad Software, La Jolla CA, USA). Results were expressed as 
Ki = IC50/(1 + [L]/KD) where [L] is the concentration of the radioligand used in the assay 
and KD the dissociation constant of the radioligand characterizing the membrane 
preparation. The apparent affinity shifts induced by GTP were measured by the ratio of Ki 
values (KiGTP/Kicontrol) and classified as agonists (ratio >1), antagonists (ratio = 1), or 
inverse agonists (ratio <1).40,41
RESULTS
Chemical Clustering of Environmental Toxins
Structural similarity analysis of the Chem2Risk knowledgebase of suspect environmental 
chemicals using a modified ChemmineR interface33 resulted in 71 compounds clustered 
with melatonin including hydroxychalcones, flavones, tamoxifen, carbaryl, and carbofuran 
(highlighted in gray, Figure 1). A majority of the coclustered environmental chemicals were 
from EPA’s DSSTox database and had at least one report classifying them as a potential 
nuclear receptor ligand. Carbamates (Figure 2) were chosen for further analyses as they had 
weak to no reported nuclear receptor activity42 and vthe highest pharmacophoric similarity 
to melatonin (Figure 2). Both carbamate insecticides share a hydrophobic moiety, a 
hydrogen bond acceptor, a hydrogen bond donor, and an aromatic moiety (Figure 2D–F).
Molecular Docking of Carbamates to hMT1 and hMT2 Melatonin Receptor Binding Sites
Melatonin and the carbamates were scored after docking into the putative melatonin binding 
pockets in hMT1 and hMT2 receptor models. Melatonin docks into the putative melatonin 
binding site with H195 (in hMT1) or H208 (in hMT2) within 2–3 Å (Figure S1B–C). 
Carbaryl consistently ranked higher than carbofuran but lower than melatonin in all of the 
scoring functions employing affinity dG (MOE) and surflex-dock scoring functions 
(SYBYL). Surflex docking experiments yielded at least five docked poses per receptor–
ligand complex where the ligand was correctly positioned into the putative binding pocket 
and was chosen for further analysis. Molecular docking scores of melatonin–melatonin 
receptor complexes were significantly higher than that of the carbamates. Surflex docking 
scores of the five top ligand-hMT2 receptor complexes were melatonin (11 ± 0.6) > carbaryl 
(8.7 ± 0.5) > carbofuran (7.9 ± 0.2), whereas the corresponding scores for the ligand-hMT1 
complexes were considerably lower for the insecticides [melatonin (11 ± 0.9) > carbaryl (6.3 
± 0.7) > carbofuran (4.7 ± 0.4)]. Autodock binding affinities (kcal/mol) of top insecticide-
MT2 complexes were −7.7 (carbaryl) and −5.8 (carbofuran) compared to −11.5 for the 
melatonin-MT2 complex consistent with the results of surflex docking scores.

 Competition of Carbamates for 2-[125I]-Iodomelatonin Binding to Human Melatonin 
Receptors
The affinities of both carbaryl and carbofuran for competition to 2-[125I]-iodomelatonin 
binding were determined for both hMT1 and hMT2 melatonin receptors stably expressed in 
CHO cells. Carbaryl (10 nM–1 mM) and carbofuran (10 nM−10 mM) competed with 2-
[125I]-iodomelatonin binding (300 pM) to membranes from CHO cells stably expressing 
either human recombinant hMT1 or hMT2 melatonin receptors40 (Figure 3C and F). Table 1 
shows affinity constants (Ki values) for the competition of melatonin, carbaryl, and 
carbofuran for 2-[125I]-iodomelatonin binding to the hMT1 and hMT2 melatonin receptors. 
The affinity of carbaryl for the hMT2 receptor was 33-fold higher than the hMT1 melatonin 
receptor, while carbofuran showed a 35-fold difference in binding affinity between the hMT1 
and hMT2 receptors (Table 1; Figure 3C,F). Both pesticides showed selectivity for hMT2 
over hMT1; however, carbaryl showed higher affinity for either the hMT1 or the hMT2 
receptors when compared with that for carbofuran (Table 1). We should note that the affinity 
of melatonin competition for 2-[125I]-iodomelatonin was 8,100 and 233 times higher than 
that for carbaryl on the hMT1 and hMT2 melatonin receptors, respectively (Table 1).
Competition of Carbaryl and Carbofuran for 2-[125I]-Iodomelatonin Binding to CHO-hMT1 
and CHO-hMT2 Cells in the Presence of GTP
GTP shift assays are useful to determine the apparent “intrinsic activity” of ligands by the 
shifts in apparent affinity in the presence of GTP, which is known to decouple the receptor 
from the G-protein and in turn promote the stimulation or inhibition of signaling. The shifts 
in apparent binding affinities of carbamates were determined in the presence of GTP (100 
μM) during competition with 2-[125I]-iodomelatonin binding to hMT1 and hMT2 melatonin 
receptors (affinity decreases for agonists, no change for antagonists, and increases for 
inverse agonists).41 GTP did not modify the apparent binding affinity of carbaryl for hMT1, 
while it significantly decreased it for the hMT2 (Figure 4A,B and Table 2). The affinity ratio 
GTP/control for carbaryl KiGTP/KiControl was 0.65 ± 0.16 (n = 5) for the hMT1 (Figure 4A 
and Table 2), while the ratio KiGTP/KiControl for that of hMT2 was 4.82 ± 0.82, which is 
consistent with ratios expected for ligands with an antagonist/inverse agonist or agonist 
(Figure 4B and Table 2). The apparent affinity of carbofuran for the hMT1 melatonin 
receptor was not affected in the presence of GTP, showing a ratio [KiGTP/KiControl = 0.59 
± 0.24] (Figure 4C, Table 2) compatible with those expected for an antagonist/inverse 
agonist. However, GTP significantly decreased the apparent affinity of carbofuran for the 
hMT2 receptor suggesting agonist efficacy (KiGTP/KiControl = 10.8 ± 4.2) (Figure 4D and 
Table 2).
DISCUSSION
Chemical clustering of environmental toxins in the Chem2Risk knowledgebase led to the 
identification of two carbamate insecticides with the highest pharmacophoric similarity to 
melatonin. These two carbamates, carbaryl and carbofuran, docked into the putative 
melatonin binding pockets in hMT1 and hMT2 receptor models with higher affinity for the 
hMT2 receptors, which was verified in competition studies of 2-[125I]-iodomelatonin 
binding to the human melatonin receptors. Lastly, both carbamates show distinct apparent

 intrinsic efficacy to the hMT1 and MT2 melatonin receptors. Together, these results suggest 
that unexpected exposure to these environmental chemicals may disrupt the homeostatic 
balance between neurotransmitter and modulators in target tissues expressing melatonin 
receptors.
Carbamate Insecticides Are Structural Mimics of Melatonin
Carbaryl and carbofuran coclustered within the same zone with melatonin (Figure 1) 
indicating high structural similarity. The pharmacophoric similarities of both carbamates 
with melatonin were also strikingly similar, indicative of potential molecular mimicry. 
Relative in silico binding affinities of the top hMT1 or hMT2 bound carbamate insecticides 
were 20–30% lower than that of melatonin. While the cognate ligand melatonin shows no 
preference toward hMT1 or hMT2, both carbamate ligands showed greater preference to 
hMT2 receptor over hMT1. The enhanced binding of the carbamate pesticides with hMT2 
can be attributed to the ring stacking interactions with H208 and partial occupancy of the 
hydrophobic cavity formed by the residues V124, I125, P212, I213, and F260 (Figure 
3A,B,D,E). These ligand–receptor interactions were similar to the binding modes and 
interactions described for the selective MT2 antagonist UCM454 and the selective partial 
agonist acylaminoethyl tetralin’s interactions with hMT2 receptors.43,44 The carbamate 
insecticides carbaryl and carbofuran, docked very similarly to the putative binding modes 
suggested for prototype melatonergic ligands with hMT2 receptors45 clearly demonstrating 
the value of integrated clustering for rapid compound filtering and identification of 
environmental ligands that share chemical and pharmacophoric similarity prior to molecular 
docking experiments from very large compound databases.
The absence of a functional group equivalent to melatonin’s methoxy-group in the 
carbamates is probably a significant contributor to their reduced affinity to both melatonin 
receptors. Participation of histidine (H195 in MT1 and H208 in MT2 or H5.46 in Ballesteros 
numbering) in hydrogen bonding interactions with melatonergic ligands and as an anchoring 
residue for receptor–melatonin interactions is implicated using various theoretical homology 
models of melatonin receptors.43,45–49 This histidine is in close proximity (2–3 Å), well 
within the molecular interaction zone to leverage hydrogen bonding and/or hydrophobic 
interactions, to the bound carbamate ligands in almost all of the top 15 conformations 
sampled for each ligand–receptor docking experiment.
The computational predictions were validated by competition binding of the insecticides for 
2-[125I]-iodomelatonin to the hMT1 and hMT2 melatonin receptors. Competition of carbaryl 
and carbofuran for 2-[125I]-iodomelatonin binding to the hMT1 and hMT2 melatonin 
receptors was to a single site with 33-fold and 35-fold higher affinity for the hMT2 receptor 
when compared with that for the hMT1 receptor, respectively. The insecticides compete for 
either melatonin receptor with lower affinity than melatonin suggesting interaction with a 
lower affinity melatonin receptor site.50 Nevertheless, competition by carbamates for 2-
[125I]-iodomelatonin binding is within the affinity range observed for other melatonin 
receptor ligands [e.g., luzindole (Ki hMT1, 179 nM; Ki hMT2, 7.3 nM); 4P-PDOT (Ki 
hMT1, 658 nM; Ki hMT2, 0.41 nM)] that compete for this radioligand (300 pM).51,52 
Furthermore, these ligands are known to block melatonin signaling and act as inverse

 agonists at constitutively active hMT1 receptors.51,52 A recent publication reported that 
another class of environmental chemicals, phthalate esters, bind with high nanomolar/low 
micromolar affinity to G protein coupled cannabinoids receptors (CB-1) and mediate 
functional signaling responses.53 It follows that carbaryl with an affinity of 2330 nM at 
hMT1 and 70 nM at MT2 receptors is likely to bind and affect melatonin mediated signaling 
in target tissues.
A key finding in this study was the carbamate interaction with the two melatonin receptors 
and their potential to affect signaling. Use of GTP in competition binding assays to assess 
intrinsic efficacy of G-protein coupled receptor ligands is a well established method to 
assess a ligand’s apparent intrinsic efficacy.40,41 In this study, we demonstrated that the 
apparent affinity of carbaryl or carbofuran for 2-[125I]-iodomelatonin binding to the MT1 
receptor was not affected, suggesting apparent intrinsic efficacy as neutral antagonists 
(Figure 4).40,41 By contrast, the apparent affinities of the two insecticides for the hMT2 
melatonin receptor decreased in the presence of GTP, suggesting agonistic apparent efficacy 
properties (Figure 4).40,41 These results suggest that exposure to carbamate insecticides that 
directly bind to human melatonin receptors could either mimic (MT2) or alternatively block 
(MT1) the effect of endogenous melatonin potentially affecting melatonin receptor mediated 
signaling in target tissues.
Alternative Mechanism(s) through Which Carbamate Insecticides Could Alter Melatonin 
Receptor Signaling
In addition to directly binding to human melatonin receptors as demonstrated in our study, 
the carbamate insecticides carbaryl and carbofuran are reported to alter the metabolism of 
serotonin (a metabolic precursor of melatonin) and melatonin.26,54–57 A single oral dose of 
carbaryl (60 mg/kg) increased the levels of serotonin,55 and repeated administration of a 
mixture of parathion, dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), and carbaryl increased the 
elimination of urinary dopamine and serotonin metabolites 3-methoxy-4-hydroxymandelic 
acid (VMA) and 5-hydroxy-3-indolyacetic acid (5-HIAA) in mammals.54
Carbamate exposure may increase risk for diseases or conditions by (1) altering melatonin 
production,56,57 (2) direct action at the level of the MT1 and MT2 melatonin receptors as 
demonstrated in this study, and/or (3) potentially altering receptor sensitivity and its ability 
to signal the time of day information at target tissues.1,18,58–60
Exposure to environmental chemicals acting via the nuclear transcription factor aryl 
hydrocarbon receptor and its role in circadian clock and metabolic disruption was recently 
reported.61 However, to date the interactions of environmental chemicals with human 
melatonin receptors have not been reported in the literature. Interactions of carbamates with 
MT1 and MT2 receptors expressed in the brain (e.g., SCN) and peripheral tissues (e.g., 
pancreatic β-cells) responding to endogenous melatonin may alter melatonin receptor 
sensitivity and signaling leading to disruptions in the rhythmic and homeostatic balance of 
key regulatory processes1,18,58–60 and metabolic functions.62 For example, disruption of 
melatonin receptor signaling in pancreatic β-cells may lead to altered glucose metabolism 
and insulin release leading to diabetes and metabolic disorders.2

 The immediate next step is to assess the effect of carbamate insecticides in validated animal 
models of circadian misalignment to determine whether our in silico and in vitro findings 
translate to environmental modulation of melatonin receptor mediated activities in vivo. 
Melatonin xeno-pharmacology is currently under-explored and has the potential of being key 
for the identification of a new class of environmental neuroendocrine disruptors targeting 
human melatonin receptors. Assessment of environmental chemicals for their disruption of 
circadian activity is currently not being considered by Tox21,63 and designing a 
comprehensive strategy to the established Chem2Risk linkages for potential environmental 
circadian disruptors can overcome this limitation. Further, designing studies to specifically 
assess the risk of exposure to these potential environmental circadian disruptors targeting 
melatonin receptors will contribute to an increased understanding of and the prevention of 
diseases and conditions resulting from exposure to these environmental agents.

binding (C). Membranes from CHO cells stably expressing hMT1 and hMT2 receptors were 
incubated with 2-[125I]-iodomelatonin (300 pM) in the absence (open circle) and presence 
(closed diamond for MT1; closed circle for MT2) of different concentrations of carbaryl (0.1 
nM to 1 mM). The ordinate represents 2-[125I]-iodomelatonin binding to either the hMT1 or 
hMT2 melatonin receptors expressed as percent of total binding (F). Membranes from CHO 
cells stably expressing hMT1 and hMT2 melatonin receptors were incubated with 2-[125I]-
iodomelatonin (300 pM) in the absence (open circle) and presence (closed square for MT1; 
closed triangle for MT2) of different concentrations of carbofuran (0.1 nM to 1 mM). The 
effect of vehicle (ethanol or DMSO) used to dissolve the carbamate compounds in 
competition for 2-[125I]-iodomelatonin binding to the hMT1 and hMT2 was negligible and 
hence was not plotted. Values are the mean ± SEM of 8 independent experiments.

2-[125I]-iodomelatonin binding to either the hMT1 (A,C) or the hMT2 (B,D) melatonin 
receptors expressed as a percent of total binding. Membranes from CHO cells stably 
expressing hMT1 and hMT2 melatonin receptors were incubated with 2-[125I]-iodomelatonin 
(300 pM) in the absence (closed diamond for MT1; closed circle for MT2) and presence 
(open diamond for MT1; open circle for MT2) of GTP (100 μM) and different concentrations 
(0.1 nM to 1 mM) of carbaryl (A,B) or carbofuran (C,D). Binding was performed using Tris 
buffer (Tris-HCl 50 mM and 10 mM MgCl2 at pH 7.4), with the absence or presence of 100 
μM GTP, 1 mM EDTA, and 150 mM NaCl, at 25 °C for 1 h. The effect of vehicle (ethanol 
or DMSO) used to dissolve the carbamate compounds in competition for 2-[125I]-
iodomelatonin binding to the melatonin receptors was negligible and hence was not plotted. 
Data shown are the mean ± SEM of 5–8 independent experiments, expressed as percentage 
of total binding. Ratio (KiGTP/KiControl) refers to the relationship between the Ki values 
obtained in the presence (KiGTP) and absence (KiControl) of GTP.

aCompetition of carbaryl and carbofuran for 2-[125I]-iodomelatonin binding to CHO cells membranes stably expressing the hMT1 and hMT2 melatonin receptors. Binding was performed at 25 °C for 1 h 
in the presence (GTP) and absence (control) of 100 μM GTP.
bKi values were calculated from IC50 values obtained from competition curves using Cheng-Prusoff’s equation.64 Ki values are expressed as the mean ± SEM of 5–6 independent experiments (n = 6 for 
melatonin, n = 5 for both carbaryl and carbofuran).
cRatio MT1GTP/MT1Control shows fold difference in the affinity (KiMT1GTP/KiMT2Control) of carbaryl and carbofuran for 2-[125I]-iodomelatonin binding to the hMT1 and hMT2 melatonin 
receptor. Ratios are expressed as the mean ± SEM of 5–10 independent experiments.
