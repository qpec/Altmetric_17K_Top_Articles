Abstract
Objective—Identify contemporary noise exposures and hearing protection use among adults.
Study Design—Cross-sectional analysis of national health survey.
Methods—Adult respondents in the 2014 National Health Interview Series hearing survey 
module were analyzed. Potentially harmful exposures to occupational and recreational noises in 
the past 12 months were extracted and quantified. Patterns of hearing protection use also were 
analyzed.
Results—Among 239.7 million adults, “loud” and “very loud” occupational noise exposures 
were reported by 5.3% and 21.7%, respectively. Of those exposed to “loud” or “very loud” sounds 
at work, only 18.7% and 43.6%, respectively, always used hearing protection. A total of 38.2% 
(1.9 million) of those with “very loud” occupational exposures never used hearing protection. 
Frequent (> 10/year) “loud” and “very loud” recreational noise exposures were reported by 13.9% 
and 21.1%, respectively, most commonly to lawn mowers (72.6% and 55.2%, respectively). When 
exposed to recreational “loud/very loud” noise, only 11.4% always used hearing protection, 
whereas 62.3% (6.3 million) never used any protection. Lifetime exposure to firearm noise was 
reported by 36.6% of adults, 11.5% of whom had used firearms in the prior 12 months. Of those, 
only 58.5% always used hearing protection, whereas 21.4% (7.4 million) never used hearing 
protection.
Conclusion—Substantial noise exposures with potentially serious long-term hearing health 
consequences frequently are occurring in occupational and recreational settings, and with the use 
of firearms. Only a minority of those exposed consistently are using hearing protection. Healthcare 
providers should actively identify and encourage the use of hearing protection with those patients 
at risk.

INTRODUCTION
Chronic high-intensity noise exposure is a common environmental hazard in the United 
States, which can not only lead to hearing loss and tinnitus1–3 but also can contribute to the 
development of numerous other health issues, including sleep disturbance, cardiovascular 
disease,4,5 and diabetes.6,7 Similarly, acute exposure to short bursts of intense sound also can 
result in noise-induced temporary or permanent hearing loss.8–11 Recent animal studies have 
provided remarkable insight into the impact of noise exposure on the auditory system, 
including acute loss of afferent synaptic terminals followed by degeneration of the cochlear 
nerve in a delayed fashion, with even mild noise traumas resulting in temporary shifts in 
hearing thresholds.8,12,13 In certain cases, this synaptopathy will have a negligible impact on 
standard audiometry, although it can lead to a compromised ability in understanding 
complex auditory stimuli.14,15 Furthermore, the subsequent degeneration of auditory 
neurons has been suggested to contribute to hearing difficulties in challenging listening 
environments, tinnitus, and hyperacusis.16,17
Although occupational noise historically has been the primary source of chronic high-
intensity noise exposure, there increasing is evidence of clinically relevant contributions 
from other sources. For example, music from compact disc (CD) and MP3 players has been 
shown to increase the risk of noise-induced permanent threshold shifts.18 Moreover, even 
short exposures from loud concerts, sporting events, or use of power tools may have a 
permanent impact on hearing.19,20 The extent of this type of leisure or recreational noise 
exposure often is underappreciated, and there are no existing regulations for its control or 
guidelines for hearing protection. As such, millions of Americans may be exposed to high-
intensity sounds, potentially resulting in previously unrecognized long-term effects on the 
auditory system.2,21,22
In addition to loud household appliances, firearms are another common source of 
occupational and recreational noise. Notably, there are an estimated 310 million firearms in 
the United States,23 and more than 23 million new background checks for firearms were 
performed in 2015—more than double the number of checks performed in 1999.24 In 2014, 
an estimated 31% of U.S. households possess a gun.25
Given the suspected commonality of these often hidden and unrecognized noise exposures, 
we sought to quantify and evaluate the prevalence of high-intensity work, recreational, and 
firearms exposures among U.S. adults. We utilized the National Health Interview Series 
(NHIS), which has collected information on a broad range of health topics through personal 
household interviews in the United States since the 1950s.26,27 In particular, the 2014 NHIS 
contains a survey module on hearing, which was analyzed for exposure patterns, as well as 
use of hearing protection during common noisy environments.

 MATERIALS AND METHODS
Adult responses in the household-based 2014 NHIS were analyzed as aggregated in the 
Integrated Health Interview Series. The study protocol was deemed exempt from review by 
our Committee on Clinical Investigations because it analyzes de-identified data that are 
publicly available. Data from responses in the hearing modules were extracted for all adult 
patients age 18.0 and older and imported into SPSS (version 22.0, IBM Corp., Armonk, NY) 
for analysis.
The self-reported incidence of noise exposure was evaluated at work and at leisure-time 
activities. At work, the noise exposure had to have occurred for at least 4 hours a day, several 
days a week. When outside of work, a positive response in the survey was defined as at least 
10 exposures in the year during any of the following activities: lawn mowers, power tools, 
household appliances, recreational vehicles, rock concerts or clubs and bars, music players 
such as iPods and MP3 players, loud sporting events, firearms, video/computer games, and 
others. When meeting the above criteria, the data were evaluated for exposure in the prior 12 
months. Additionally, data for the use of hearing protection were also analyzed under these 
conditions.
All respondents were specifically asked to characterize the noise exposure as “loud” or “very 
loud,” and these subgroups were independently analyzed. “Loud” was defined as noise that 
is so loud that a raised voice must be used to be heard, whereas “very loud” was defined as 
noise so intense that shouting volumes must be used to be heard at 3 feet (arm’s length). 
Additionally, firearms use in both work and recreational settings was analyzed. Further 
subgroup analysis was performed to evaluate where the firearms were used in occupational 
or leisure settings, the number of rounds fired in the last year, and the frequency of hearing 
protection use.
The raw sample size was extrapolated to representative statistics for the national population 
in the United States by using sample weights and survey statistics that account for the 
weighted and stratified survey design. The data are reported as the mean with its associated 
standard error. Statistical comparisons were conducted with chi-square, with significance set 
at P ≤ 0.05.
RESULTS
Among the 239.7 million ± 2.5 million subjects (raw = 36,697), mean age was 47.0 years, 
with 51.8% female respondents. The sampled cohort (Fig. 1) was distributed in the South 
(37.2%), Midwest (23.0%), West (22.5%), and Northeast (17.3%). While at work, 21.7% of 
respondents reported “very loud” sound exposure in the last 12 months, at least 4 hours a 
day, several times a week, requiring them to shout in order to be understood at arm’s length. 
In this cohort, 33.7% report having greater than 15 years of such noise exposure (Table I), 
43.6% always used hearing protection in the last year, whereas 38.2% (1.9 million) never did 
(Table I). In contrast, 5.3% of respondents reported “loud” sound exposure at work, mostly 
commonly in the last 1 to 2 years (22.7%), as seen in Table II. These respondents used

 hearing protection less frequently because 67.3% never used hearing protection when 
exposed to loud sounds (Table II).
When asked about the use of firearms, 36.6% of all respondents reported having fired a 
firearm in their lifetime. Of those, 76.6% (67.0 million) reported having fired one for 
recreational purposes (Table III). Although the majority users (59.6%) fired fewer than 100 
rounds, there were 2.9 million (8.4%) who reported firing between 1,000 to 10,000 rounds. 
Of those, only 67.0% used hearing protection consistently, as noted in Table IV. Overall, 
58.5% of all respondents used hearing protection at all times, whereas 21.4% never did. The 
use of hearing protection was more common in occupational use of firearms (77.9% always 
used hearing protection at work), whereas only 56.3% used it consistently with recreational 
use (P <0.001).
Noise exposures greater than 10 times per year in leisure/recreational settings were also 
queried. “Very loud” sound exposure was more common (21.1%), whereas only 13.9% were 
exposed to “loud” sounds. The most common noise exposure was the lawn mower for both 
levels of exposure, followed by power tools for “very loud” sounds (52.9%) and household 
appliances (43.7%) (Fig. 2). When exposed to recreational “loud” or “very loud” noises, 
only 11.4% always used hearing protection, and 62.3% (6.3 million) never used any hearing 
protection (Table V).
Additionally, when examining the subset of respondents with very high intensity (“very 
loud”) current work noise exposure, we found that among these individuals, 41.7% and 
31.6% also reported exposure to very high-intensity recreational and firearms noise, 
respectively, in the prior 12 months. Furthermore, 15.6% had both nonwork-related very 
high-intensity noise exposures.
DISCUSSION
Noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) is considered to be one of the most common 
occupational health concerns in the United States because both chronic high-intensity noise 
and intense impulse noise can have detrimental effects on human hearing.28 Although both 
types of noise trauma are harmful, some believe that impulse noise may be even more 
deleterious to hearing than continuous noise.29 Effects of NIHL may be exacerbated with 
age-related threshold shifts because the body undergoes summative loss from impulse noise 
and chronic noise exposure, resulting in clinically significant hearing loss over time.30 
Occupational groups at the highest risk of NIHL are military personnel, construction 
workers, and farmers, among others29; however, even in the everyday environment of the 
current technologically advanced world, nearly all people are susceptible to acoustic trauma.
In 1981, the United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) created 
noise exposure guidelines and standards for workers in the manufacturing and service 
sectors out of concern for the harmful effects of occupational acoustic exposure.28 They 
mandated a limit of 8 hours of exposure to an average of 85 dBA, along with company-
sponsored annual hearing exams, training, and hearing protection. However, as evident from 
our data, fewer than half of the respondents use hearing protection regularly in occupational

 settings when exposed to “loud” and “very loud” sounds for greater than several hours a day. 
In fact, an overwhelming majority of respondents who are exposed to “loud” sounds never 
have used hearing protection in occupational settings; accordingly, occupational hearing 
protection should be discussed when evaluating a patient with hearing loss or tinnitus. Given 
that 0.91 million (18.2%) and 1.9 million (38.2%) workers sometimes or never, respectively, 
used hearing protection at work when exposed to very intense sounds in the last year, a case 
could be made for screening at the primary care level or other interventions to identify these 
at risk populations.
In addition to occupational noise trauma, high-intensity noise exposures also can occur 
during recreational or leisure time, and can be associated with hearing loss as well as 
tinnitus.27 Similarly, in a population-based study, Dalton et al. reported that recreational 
noise from woodworking (100 dBA+), metalworking (100 dBA+), and chainsaw use (125 
dBA), among others, produced an increased risk of a hearing loss.21,31 Other impulse noises 
can present in the form of firearms (150 dBA+), music players (100 dBA+), household 
appliances (80 dBA+), rock concerts (110–120 dBA), and sports venues (110 dBA+).31 
These types of impulse noises frequently were reported in our cohort, with the lawnmower
— which can generate sound pressure levels of over 100 dBA noise level—as the most 
commonly reported “loud” and a “very loud” sound exposure. 32 Such sound levels at a 
worksite would mandate a limitation of 2 hours per day with hearing protection per OSHA 
guidelines.28 Other common sources of “loud” and “very loud” sounds are shown in Figure 
2. Our data not only highlight the widespread use of equipment that can be “very loud,” but 
more importantly, that an overwhelming 62.3% of Americans never use hearing protection 
while operating such machinery. Healthcare providers should therefore screen for and 
counsel their patients on the use of hearing protection in such environments because the use 
of hearing protection such as ear plugs can be beneficial in preventing hearing loss from 
recreational noise exposures.19
The prevalence of hearing loss in adolescents has been increasing, from 14.9% in 1988 to 
1994 to 19.5% in 2005 to 2006,33 which may be attributable to an environment increasingly 
filled with amplified sounds. Since the rise in CD/MP3 player popularity in the 2000s, there 
has been concern that long-term exposure to high-intensity music would increase the risk of 
hearing loss.34 As common users of MP3 players and gaming systems, children and young 
adults may be particular at risk35,36 because, although the newer generations of MP3 players 
have an upper-volume limit, these devices still can generate sounds up to 100 dBA.37 This 
exposure should be monitored because sustained listening to high-intensity music at such 
unsafe levels can have a detrimental effect on hearing.38,39 Nearly a third of the respondents 
indicate that they repeatedly have been exposed to “loud” and “very loud” sounds (Fig. 2) 
with a music player; thus, screening for high-intensity music noise exposure in children and 
adults is of paramount importance.
Exposures to short-impulse noise, including from firearm use, have been shown to 
exacerbate age-related hearing loss, and have been estimated to contribute an additional 7 to 
8 dBA of hearing loss.40 Helfer et al. noted a higher incidence of hearing loss and tinnitus in 
military personnel following deployment,41,42 and the authors suggest that this is the likely 
consequence of firearm and impulse noise exposures. In a large population-based study,

 Nondahl et al. found a significant association between recreational shooting and hearing 
loss.43 It is well-established that sounds above 140 dBA can cause permanent hearing 
damage, and nearly all firearms can surpass this level.44,45 Consequently, just one round 
may be sufficient to create noise-induced threshold shifts,46 contributing to cumulative 
auditory damage.44,47,48 Interestingly, we found that over a third (36.6%) of Americans have 
used a firearm, predominantly in recreational settings, and over 40% of this group have fired 
over 100 rounds in the past 12 months. Notably, only 58.5% of those who shot firearms used 
hearing protection consistently in the last year, whereas the remainder inconsistently or 
never used hearing protection. Additionally, an astonishingly high percentage (20.3%) of 
those who shot greater than 10,000 rounds in the past 12 months never used any protection. 
Given these data, screening for firearms use and discussing the benefits of regular hearing 
protection use by health-care providers could improve the hearing health of a large segment 
of the American population.
There are several limitations to our study, including the subjective nature of the responses to 
these questions, because personal definitions of “loud” and “very loud” sounds will vary. 
However, in the survey questionnaire these were defined as practical levels with respect to 
the survey respondent (e.g., “very loud” as a sound requiring them to shout to be understood 
at an arm’s length). Interestingly, these very same qualifiers for noise level likely could be 
adapted into screening questions for noise exposures at the primary care level. Additionally, 
audiometric data for survey respondents are not available; therefore, it is difficult to establish 
a causative relationship between these noise exposures and hearing loss, if present. 
Furthermore, the potential for recall bias in the respondents is of significance. Respondents 
may have misremembered the true nature of the quality and quantity of noise exposure in 
both recreational and occupational settings. Nevertheless, the strongest attribute of our study 
is the utilization of a large database that samples the general citizen population in the United 
States. The respondents in the NHIS are surveyed from all the 50 states and District of 
Columbia, with a nonzero probability of selection. As such, the current data provide the 
most contemporary, large-scale insight into noise exposures in the U.S. adult population.
CONCLUSION
This 2014 NHIS survey highlights the common sources of “loud” and “very loud” 
continuous and impulse noises in the daily life of a person living in the United States, 
ranging from occupational hazards to common household tools such as lawn mowers, power 
tools, music players, and video games. Substantial noise exposures with potentially serious 
long-term hearing health consequences also are frequently occurring with use of firearms. In 
most settings, only a minority of those exposed consistently are using hearing protection 
during noise exposure. Due to the short- and long-term sequelae of noise-induced auditory 
trauma, healthcare providers should actively identify and encourage the use of hearing 
protection among those patients at risk.
