SUMMARY
Antibody blockade of the inhibitory CTLA-4 pathway has led to clinical benefit in a subset of 
patients with metastatic melanoma. Anti-CTLA-4 enhances T cell responses, including production 
of IFN-γ, which is a critical cytokine for host immune responses. However, the role of IFN-γ 
signaling in tumor cells in the setting of anti-CTLA-4 therapy remains unknown. Here we 
demonstrate that patients identified as non-responders to anti-CTLA-4 (ipilimumab) have tumors 
with genomic defects in IFN-γ pathway genes. Furthermore, mice bearing melanoma tumors with 
knockdown of IFN-γ receptor 1 (IFNGR1) have impaired tumor rejection upon anti-CTLA-4 
therapy. These data highlight that loss of the IFN-γ signaling pathway is associated with primary 
resistance to anti-CTLA-4 therapy. Our findings demonstrate the importance of tumor genomic

INTRODUCTION
Blockade of T cell inhibitory pathways has become a new paradigm in cancer therapy. 
Current immune inhibitory pathways that are being targeted include cytotoxic-lymphocyte 
antigen-4 (CTLA-4) and programmed-death-1 and its ligand (PD-1/PD-L1) (Sharma and 
Allison, 2015a, b). Anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1 monotherapies have led to significant 
clinical benefits in patients with melanoma, lung cancer, renal cell carcinoma, and bladder 
cancer (Borghaei et al., 2015; Hodi et al., 2010; Motzer et al., 2015; Robert et al., 2011; 
Rosenberg et al., 2016). The first antibody approved by the FDA was anti-CTLA-4 
(ipilimumab, Bristol-Myers Squibb), which improved median overall survival in patients 
with metastatic melanoma (Hodi et al., 2010; Robert et al., 2011). Although ipilimumab 
therapy resulted in significant survival benefit in about 20% of patients with metastatic 
melanoma, the majority of patients, however, did not benefit from this therapy. To date, 
mechanisms responsible for lack of clinical responses in some patients remain unknown.
Our previous studies demonstrated that ipilimumab treatment led to an increase in IFN-γ 
production by T cells (Liakou et al., 2008). Studies in mice also indicated that anti-CTLA-4

 treatment of tumor-bearing mice enhanced IFN-γ production by T cells and IFN-γ signaling 
in T cells plays an essential role for anti-tumor immune response mediated by anti-CTLA-4 
therapy (Fu et al., 2011; Shi et al., 2016). As an essential effector molecule for immune 
responses (Dunn et al., 2006), IFN-γ exerts its downstream effects by binding to the IFN-γ 
receptor (IFNGR) consisting of two subunits, IFNGR1 and IFNGR2. Binding of IFN-γ to its 
receptor results in recruitment and activation of the Janus kinases, JAK1 and JAK2, and 
subsequent phosphorylation, dimerization, and activation of a transcription factor known as 
signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)1. STAT1 homodimers then 
translocate to the nucleus where they bind to specific promoter elements and modulate 
transcription of IFN-γregulated genes (Ikeda et al., 2002). This series of events of IFN-γ 
signaling culminate in immune cell activation.
In addition to immune cell activation, in vitro treatment with IFN-γ can also directly inhibit 
tumor cell growth and promote tumor cell apoptosis by binding to IFN-γ receptor and 
subsequent activation of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway (Chin et al., 1997; Detjen et al., 
2001; Ikeda et al., 2002). Therefore, tumor cells containing defective IFN-γ signaling 
pathway genes may be resistant to IFN-γ-mediated growth inhibition and apoptosis. Since 
our data indicate that anti-CTLA-4 treatment resulted in significant production of IFN-γ, we 
hypothesized that tumor cells containing defective IFN-γ signaling pathway genes may be 
resistant to anti-CTLA-4 therapy.
Here, we show that melanoma samples from patients who lacked clinical responses to 
ipilimumab harbor a much higher rate of genomic defects in the IFN-γ pathway genes as 
compared to melanoma samples obtained from patients who had clinical responses to 
ipilimumab. We used shRNA technology to abolish IFNGR1 expression in the B16/BL6 
melanoma tumor cell line and found that these cells were resistant to IFN-γ treatment in 
vitro. In addition, mice treated with anti-CTLA-4 demonstrated impaired rejection of 
B16/BL6 tumors lacking expression of the IFNGR1 gene as compared to those bearing 
B16/BL6 tumors with intact expression of the IFNGR1 gene. Overall, our data demonstrate 
that IFN-γ signaling deficiency in melanoma tumor cells is associated with lack of response 
to anti-CTLA-4 treatment.
RESULTS
Melanoma tumors resistant to ipilimumab therapy contain genomic defects in IFN-γ 
γ 
pathway genes
We evaluated available whole exome sequencing (WES) data for genomic changes of IFN-γ 
pathway genes in melanoma tumors from 16 patients (Table S1), which consisted of 12 
patient who did not respond to ipilimumab therapy (non-responders) and 4 patients who did 
respond to ipilimumab therapy (responders). IFN-γ pathway genes were defined by the 
QIAGEN human interferon and receptor functional gene grouping and other databases 
(Table S2). Tumor samples from non-responders were found to have significantly more 
somatic mutations including copy number alterations (CNAs) and single nucleotide variants 
(SNVs) of the IFN-γ pathway genes (Figure 1A). A total of 184 mutations were detected in 
the 12 non-responders, including 142 CNAs and 42 SNVs; whereas only 4 mutations were 
detected in the responders, all of which are SNVs. We identified an average of 15.33

 mutations in IFN-γ pathway genes in non-responders as compared to an average of only 1 
mutation in responders. A permutation test demonstrated that the significant enrichment of 
mutations in non-responders was not observed by chance (p = 0.015, Figure S1A). However, 
we did not observe a significant difference in the enrichment of SNVs between the non-
responders and responders (p = 0.261, Figure S1B). These data suggest that CNAs, as 
oppose to SNVs, are the dominant genomic events that are associated with resistance to 
ipilimumab therapy.
A significantly higher proportion of tumors from non-responder patients (9/12 = 75%) had 
CNAs involving IFN-γ pathway genes than tumors from responder patients (0/4 = 0%) 
(p=0.019, Figure 1B). The most significant CNAs included genomic loss of key IFN-γ 
pathway genes such as IFNGR1, IRF-1, JAK2, and IFNGR2, as well as amplification of 
important IFN-γ pathway inhibitors including SOCS1 and PIAS4 (Figure 1A). Collectively, 
these data strongly suggest that tumors from non-responder patients contain a significantly 
higher number of genomic defects leading to, at least in part, defective IFN-γ signaling that 
may result in primary resistance to ipilimumab therapy.
To confirm these initial findings, we evaluated an independent cohort of patients that was 
previously published (Van Allen et al., 2015). Patients were divided into responders and 
non-responders to ipilimumab therapy, with the exclusion of all patients who were listed as 
stable disease (Table S3). Our analyses confirmed a higher frequency of CNAs involving 
IFN-γ pathway genes in non-responder patients as compared to responder patients (Figure 
1C and Figure S2).
Tumors with CNAs of the IFN-γ pathway genes correlate with shorter survival in patients 
with metastatic melanoma
Since our data suggested that CNAs of the IFN-γ pathway genes in melanoma tumors may 
predict primary resistance to ipilimumab therapy, we hypothesized that patients bearing 
melanoma tumors containing CNAs of IFN-γ pathway genes would be less responsive to 
endogenous IFN-γ associated with host immune response and therefore, should have poor 
clinical outcome. To test this, we analyzed the available data on a total of 367 patients with 
metastatic melanoma in the TCGA database. Of these patients, 134 had CNAs of the IFN-γ 
pathway genes, whereas the other 233 contained wild-type IFN-γ pathway genes. We found 
that the patients with tumors containing CNAs of IFN-γ pathway genes had significantly 
shorter overall survival (40 months) than those with wild-type tumors (48.2 months, p = 
0.0018) (Figure 1D).
Melanoma cell lines that are refractory to in vitro treatment with IFN-γ contain genomic 
defects in IFN-γ pathway genes
Next, we evaluated 6 primary tumor cell lines derived from patients with melanoma to 
determine whether differences in response to in vitro treatment with IFN-γ correlated to the 
mutation status of IFN-γ pathway genes. We found that IFN-γ treatment of 3 primary 
melanoma tumor cell lines (C1–3) demonstrated significant induction of IRF-1, which is a 
downstream gene of the IFN-γ signaling pathway. However, 3 other cell lines (C4–6) had 
minimal induction of the IRF-1 gene in response to IFN-γ (Figure 2A). Unsupervised

 clustering of gene expression fold changes between post-treatment vs. pre-treatment samples 
for the 6 cell lines confirmed differences in expression of IFN-γ pathway genes for the IFN-
γ responder vs. IFN-γ non-responder cell lines (Figure 2B). From the microarray data, we 
identified a subset of 36 probes (Table S4) that were significantly and consistently increased 
in the 3 IFN-γ responder cell lines as compared to the 3 IFN-γ non-responder cell lines 
(Figure 2B). This subset of probes was comprised of genes that are related to the IFN-γ 
pathway including IRF-1, CXCL10, IFIT1, IFIT2 and IFIT3 (Table S4). As indicated in 
Figure 2B, all of these IFN-γ pathway genes have higher fold changes in the responder than 
in the non-responder cell lines with IFN-γ treatment. In addition, we found copy number 
loss in key IFN-γ pathway genes in two of the three IFN-γ non-responder cell lines. Cell 
line C5 had copy number loss for IFIT1, IFIT2, IFIT3 and IFIT1B genes while cell line C6 
had loss of the IRF8 gene. On the contrary, there was no copy number loss in the 3 IFN-γ 
responder cell lines (Figure 2C). These data demonstrate that tumor cells that are less 
responsive to in vitro IFN-γ treatment are likely to harbor loss of IFN-γ pathway genes.
Knockdown of IFNGR1 attenuates IFN-γ-mediated suppression of B16/BL6 cell 
proliferation and apoptosis
To further study the impact of loss of IFN-γ signaling in tumor cells, we used shRNA 
technology to decrease expression of IFNGR1 in the murine B16/BL6 melanoma cell line, 
which is an IFN-γ responsive cell lines selected from a cohort of murine tumor cell lines 
(Figure S4). We confirmed effective knockdown of the IFNGR1 gene at both mRNA and 
protein levels (Figure 3A). Loss of upregulation of IRF-1 gene upon IFN-γ treatment further 
confirmed functional knockdown of the IFNGR1 gene (Figure 3B). IFN-γ resulted in dose-
dependent inhibition of cell proliferation of the wild-type and scramble shRNA-transduced 
B16/BL6 cell lines. However, loss of the IFNGR1 gene restored proliferation of the 
B16/BL6 tumor cells even in the presence of IFN-γ (Figure 3C). Furthermore, loss of the 
IFNGR1 gene also attenuated IFN-γ– induced apoptosis of B16/BL6 tumor cells in vitro, 
irrespective of doses of IFN-γ (Figure 3D).
Knockdown of IFNGR1 gene in B16/BL6 tumors promotes in vivo tumor growth and 
reduces mouse survival in response to anti-CTLA-4 therapy
To assess effects of IFNGR1 knockdown on tumor growth in vivo, we inoculated C57BL/6 
mice with B16/BL6 tumor cells and treated with anti-CTLA-4. Similar to our previously 
published studies (Fu et al., 2011), 100% of the wild-type, scramble shRNA-transduced, and 
IFNGR1 shRNA-transduced B16/BL16 cell lines proliferated and formed measurable 
tumors in untreated mice (Figure 4A). However, after anti-CTLA-4 treatment, 4/22 mice 
with wild-type B16/BL6 tumors and 4/25 mice with scramble shRNA-transduced B16/BL6 
tumors had progressive tumor growth, while 12/25 mice with IFNGR1 shRNA-transduced 
B16/BL16 tumors had progressive tumor growth. We also evaluated the tumor burden in 
different cohorts of mice (Figure 4B). While we did not find significant difference in tumor 
size for all untreated cohorts, the growth of wild-type tumors and tumors transduced with the 
scramble shRNA was significantly inhibited by anti-CTLA-4 therapy. In contrast, tumors 
transduced with IFNGR1 shRNA had impaired response to anti-CTLA-4 therapy and were 
significantly larger as compared to control tumors (p<0.05). Of note, anti-CTLA-4 treated 
tumors from all cohorts of mice were found to have a significant increase in the ratio of CD8

 effector T cells to FoxP3+ regulatory T cells (Figure 4C), an important index reflective of 
effective treatment of anti-CTLA-4 (Quezada et al., 2006), suggesting IFNGR1 knockdown 
in tumors does not significantly affect T cell infiltration into tumors. In addition, all 
untreated mice died as a result of tumor growth while anti-CTLA-4 treatment led to long-
term survival of ~80% of mice bearing B16/BL6 tumors with intact IFNGR1 gene 
expression, which was significantly higher (p= 0.0174) than that of mice bearing B16/BL6 
tumors lacking the IFNGR1 gene (Figure 4D). These data offer direct evidence that tumor 
cell loss of the IFNGR1 gene, which results in loss of IFN-γ signaling, leads to resistance to 
anti-CTLA-4 therapy.
DISCUSSION
Ipilimumab (anti-CTLA-4) therapy has provided significant clinical benefit to patients with 
metastatic melanoma. However, only a subset of patients, approximately 20%, derive long-
term survival benefit (Hodi et al., 2010). To date, extensive efforts are ongoing to understand 
response and resistance mechanisms to anti-CTLA-4 therapy. Multiple publications have 
reported that anti-CTLA-4, and other immune checkpoint therapies, lead to an increase in 
IFN-γ production (Alegre et al., 1998; Chen et al., 2009; Dulos et al., 2012; Liakou et al., 
2008; Paradis et al., 2001; Peng et al., 2012), which plays an important role in immune 
responses (Dunn et al., 2006; Szabo et al., 2003). For example, we previously reported that 
treatment of patients with ipilimumab led to enhanced immune responses including 
increased IFN-γ production by T cells expressing inducible costimulator (ICOS) (Liakou et 
al., 2008).
IFN-γ plays a critical role in regulating T cell responses, including driving Th1 immune 
responses, which are required for tumor rejection (Dunn et al., 2006; Szabo et al., 2003). 
IFN-γ elicits multiple signals in T cells to enable effective T cell function, while loss of 
IFN-γ pathways in T cells impairs T cell responses and permits tumor growth and 
persistence (Ikeda et al., 2002; Kaplan et al., 1998). These data established a clear role for 
IFN-γ in shaping immune responses, especially anti-tumor T cell responses.
IFN-γ has also been shown to affect tumor cell growth. For example, in vitro data 
demonstrated that IFN-γ can directly inhibit tumor cell growth and promote tumor cell 
apoptosis (Chin et al., 1997; Detjen et al., 2001; Ikeda et al., 2002). Previous pre-clinical 
studies have also shown that defects in IFNGR1, JAK1, and JAK2 genes render tumor cells 
unresponsive to IFN-γ, which enables tumor cell growth in the presence of IFN-γ (Dunn et 
al., 2005; Ikeda et al., 2002; Kaplan et al., 1998). These data suggest effective antitumor 
immune responses depend upon functional IFN-γ signaling pathway in tumor cells.
Although there are likely to be multiple mechanisms that lead to resistance to ipilimumab 
therapy, we hypothesized that tumor cells with defective IFN-γ signaling would be resistant 
to anti-CTLA-4 therapy. Consistent with this hypothesis, our clinical data indicate that 
tumors from patients with metastatic melanoma who did not respond to ipilimumab had 
higher frequency of genomic alterations of IFN-γ pathway genes as compared to tumor 
samples from patients with clinical responses to ipilimumab (Figure 1). These genomic 
alterations include copy number loss of key IFN-γ pathway genes such as IFNGR1, IRF-1, 
Gao et al.

 JAK2, and IFNGR2, as well as amplification of important IFN-γ pathway inhibitors 
including SOCS1 and PIAS4 (Figure 1). In addition, a concurrent report suggests that the 
loss of IFN-γ pathway genes, such as JAK1 and JAK2, is associated with resistance to anti-
PD-1 therapy (Zaretsky et al., 2016). Therefore, it is possible that IFN-γ pathway gene 
defects represent an important resistance mechanism for multiple immune checkpoint 
therapies.
Our data revealed that a surprisingly high proportion (9/12 =75%) of ipilimumab non-
responders harbor certain genomic defects of the IFN-γ pathway genes (Figure 1). Loss of 
IFNGR1, IFNGR2, JAK2, and IRF-1 genes (Figure 1) would impair the IFN-γ signaling 
pathway (Dunn et al., 2006; Ikeda et al., 2002). Other genomic losses in these non-responder 
tumors include downstream IFN-γ pathway genes such as the family of IFIT1, IFIT2, and 
IFIT3 genes (Figure 1 and Figure S3B). Although their functions are not completely 
understood, it was reported that these genes promote tumor apoptosis and loss of them 
would favor tumor growth (Reich, 2013).
In addition, we identified amplification of two well-known suppressors of the IFN-γ 
signaling pathway, SOCS1 and PIAS4 (Liu et al., 2001; Song and Shuai, 1998). 
Interestingly, we also observed co-deletions of IFNA, IFNB, MTAP, and miR-31 genes on 
chromosome 9p21 (6/12=50%, Figure 1 and Figure S3A). Although IFNA and IFNB genes 
are not essential genes for the IFN-γ signaling pathway, loss of the MTAP gene, which 
encodes methylthioadenosine phosphorylase, has been reported to result in intracellular 
accumulation of its enzymatic substrate methylthioadenosine that can inactivate transcription 
factor STAT1, the central component of the IFN-γ signaling pathway (Mowen et al., 2001). 
Moreover, loss of miR-31 has been reported to promote Th2-biased immune response that is 
known to favor tumor growth (van der Heide et al., 2016). Taken together, these data allow 
us to compile a possible gene signature consisting of loss of IFN-γ signaling-related genes 
(IFNGR1, IFNGR2, JAK2, IRF-1, IFIT1, IFIT2, IFIT3, MTAP, and miR31) and 
amplification of IFN-γ signaling pathway suppressor genes (SOCS1 and PIAS4) that may 
serve as a genomic biomarker to stratify patients for probability of response to immune 
checkpoint therapy.
Our data are based on a small number of patients and will need to be validated prospectively 
in larger cohorts of patients, including patients who receive combination immunotherapy 
strategies. It is possible that certain combination therapies may overcome the effects 
generated by defects in IFN-γ pathway genes. Additional studies in pre-clinical models 
would be needed to test the impact of combination immunotherapy strategies on tumor cells 
lacking key IFN-γ pathway genes. Further studies to elucidate other potential intra-tumoral 
mechanisms of resistance to immune checkpoint therapies, including epigenetic, 
transcriptional and translational mechanisms, are warranted.
Overall, our data highlight an IFN-γ pathway gene signature that warrants confirmation in 
prospective clinical trials. Based upon the study with anti-PD1 (Zaretsky et al., 2016) and 
our study with anti-CTLA-4, the cumulative data indicate that loss of IFN-γ signaling in 
tumor cells may represent a common mechanism for tumor resistance to immune checkpoint 
therapy. Additional studies will be needed to determine whether these genomic data can be

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS
Melanoma patients and assessment of clinical benefit on ipilimumab—A cohort 
of 16 patients with metastatic melanoma was included in this study. These patients were 
treated at the UT MD Anderson Cancer Center between October 2011 and March 2015 and 
had tumor samples collected and analyzed under IRB-approved protocols (IRB LAB00-063; 
LAB03-0320; 2012-0846; PA13-0291; PA12-0305). Of note, these studies were conducted 
in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and approved by the UT MD Anderson 
Cancer Center institutional review board. Electronic medical charts were reviewed 
independently by two investigators to assign clinical response group. These 16 patients 
(Table S1) were treated with CTLA-4 blockade, with 4 responding, while 12 progressed, as 
defined by RECIST criteria (Therasse et al., 2000) at 3–6 months after initiation of therapy.
Clinical samples—Tumor samples were obtained from the UT MD Anderson Cancer 
Center Department of Pathology archive and Institutional Tumor Bank with appropriate 
written informed consent and institutional IRB (LAB00-063; LAB03-0320; 2012-0846; 
PA13-0291; PA12-0305). Tumor biopsy samples were collected at multiple time points 
during treatment when feasible, including pre-treatment, on-treatment and progression anti-
CTLA-4 biopsies. All samples utilized for analysis were reviewed in central pathology to 
ensure viable tumor was present.
Establishment of tumor cell lines from tumor samples—Tumor cell lines were 
established from metastatic melanoma samples from patients enrolled on the IRB-approved 
adoptive T cell therapy study for the use of Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes (#2004-0069). 
Briefly, a single cell suspension was obtained through manual dissection of the tumor 
specimen followed by incubation with an enzymatic digestion cocktail (0.375% Collagenase 
Type I, 75 μg/ml hyaluronidase and 250 units/ml DNase I in RPMI 1640) in a humidified 
incubator at 37°C with 5% CO2 and with gentle rotation for 2–3h. The digested material 
was then filtered through a 70 um filter, washed, resuspended in fresh media (RPMI 1640 
with Glutamax, 10% FBS, 10mM HEPES, 1X Pen/Strep, 20 μg/ml, 50 μM 2-
mercaptoethanol, Insulin-Selenium-Transferrin supplement (5 μg/ml, Invitrogen) and plated 
in one well of a 6-well culture plate. On the next day, the non-adherent cells were washed 
out and fresh media was added. Cultures were deemed established when the expanded cells 
stained positive for a melanoma tumor marker and negative for a fibroblast marker (CD90). 
MCSP-1 was used as a melanoma tumor surface marker to assess the purity of the tumor cell

 line by flow cytometry once enough cells were grown. All cell lines were tested for 
mycoplasma and fingerprinted before use.
Cell lines were validated by STR DNA fingerprinting using the Promega 16 High Sensitivity 
STR Kit (Catalog # DC2100). The STR profiles were compared to online search databases 
(DSMZ/ATCC/JCRB/RIKEN) of 2455 known profiles; along with the MD Anderson 
Characterized Cell Line Core (CCLC) database of 2556 know profiles. The STR profiles 
matched known DNA fingerprints or were unique.
Mice, cell lines, and reagents—C57BL/6 mice were purchased from the Jackson 
Laboratory. All in vivo experiments used female mice. Experiments were carried out under 
pathogen-free conditions according to approved protocols from the UT MD Anderson 
Cancer Center IACUC. The B16/BL6 murine melanoma cell line and B16/BL6 expressing 
GM-CSF (GVAX) were maintained, used, and grown as previously published (Fu et al., 
2011). Puromycin of 2 μg/ml was added to the culture medium for maintenance of B16/
BL6-IFNGR1 knockdown and B16/BL6-scramble cell lines. All cell lines used in this study 
were tested to make sure they were free of mycoplasma. Anti-CTLA-4 monoclonal antibody 
(clone 9H10) was purchased from BioXcell.
METHOD DETAILS
Microarray gene expression analysis—Pre- and post-treatment samples were 
collected for total RNA isolation using the Qiagen RNeasy Mini Kit. Total RNA was used 
for Affymetrix GeneChip Human Genome U133 2.0 Array analysis. Microarray data were 
preprocessed using the affy bioconductor package. Background correction and quantile 
normalization were performed using the Robust Multi-chip Average (RMA) function in affy. 
The fold changes of interferon pathway genes were calculated by comparing the expression 
values of selected genes from Table S2 in the IFN-γ-treated vs. untreated cell lines. 
Unsupervised clustering of the fold changes after IFN-γ treatment were used to partition the 
6 samples into 2 clusters.
Whole exome sequencing (WES) analysis—WES experiments were performed on 
tumor tissues from 16 patients (4 responders and 12 non-responders) as well as 6 melanoma 
tumor-derived cell lines. Normal peripheral blood was used as controls. The initial 250ng 
genomic DNA was sheared using low Tris-EDTA buffer. KAPA Hyper Prep Kit (#KK8504) 
was used for end repair, A-base addition, adapter ligation, and library enrichment PCR. 
Library construction was performed following manufacturer's instructions. Sample 
concentrations were measured following library construction using the Agilent Bioanalyzer. 
Hybridization reaction was then performed. In terms of target capture, the Agilent 
SureSelect-XT Target Enrichment (#5190-8646) protocol was followed, according to 
manufacturer guidelines. The libraries were then normalized to equal concentrations using 
an Eppendorf Mastercycler EP Gradient instrument and pooled to equimolar amounts on the 
Agilent Bravo B platform. Libraries were quantified using the KAPA Library Quantification 
Kit (#KK4824). For the cell line samples, genomic DNA was sheared, end repaired, ligated 
with barcoded Illumina sequencing adapters, amplified, size selected and subjected to in 
solution hybrid capture using the Agilent SureSelect Human All Exon v2.0 bait set (Fisher et

 al., 2011; Gnirke et al., 2009). The resulted libraries were then qPCR quantified, pooled, and 
sequenced with 76 base paired-end reads using Illumina HiSeq 2000 sequencer. The median 
on-target read coverage ranges from 101X to 232X. The tumor purity ranges from 80% to 
95%, except 50% for only one sample.
The raw reads were aligned to the human hg19 reference genome using the BWA aligner 
(bwa-0.7.5a) (Gnirke et al., 2009). Duplicate reads were marked using the Picard (v1.112, 
http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/) “MarkDuplicates” module. The “IndelRealigner” and 
“BaseRecalibrator” modules of the Genome Analysis Toolkit were applied to the obtained 
BAM files for indel realignment and base quality recalibration. Mutect (v1.1.4) was used to 
each tumor and its matching normal sample to detect somatic single nucleotide variants 
(SNVs) (Cibulskis et al., 2013). The detected SNVs were annotated with ANNOVA (Wang 
et al., 2010) and compared with public databases such as dbSNP (Sherry et al., 2001), 1000 
genome (http://www.1000genomes.org/) and ESP6500 (http://evs.gs.washington.edu/EVS/). 
To ensure accuracy, the following criteria was required to each detected somatic SNV: allele 
frequency (AF) > 0.05; the coverage is at least 30 reads for the tumor and 10 for the normal; 
the AF from the normal sample <=0.01. The filtered somatic SNVs were annotated with 
dbSNP and compared with public databases. To avoid including germline mutations, we 
further required the AF < 0.01 from both the ESP6500 and 1000 genome databases. 
Detected SNVs in dbSNPs were discarded. An in-house R package ExomeCN was applied 
to infer somatic copy number alterations (CNAs) by first calculating the tumor/normal read 
counts log2 ratio of the capture regions (minimum reads counts >= 5, map quality >= 10) 
followed by segmentation (alpha='0.01' nperm='10000' undoSplit='sdundo' undoSD='2' 
minWidth='3') (Olshen et al., 2004).
The associations of somatic CNAs with ipilimumab clinical responses were based on one-
tailed Fisher’s exact test. A sample is called to carry a gene gain (or loss) if the log2 copy 
ratio of tumor over normal of this gene > 0.5 (or < -0.5) in the patient data. The log2 copy 
ratio cutoff was 1 in the cell line WES data and 0.7 in Van Allen’s WES data. We define a 
sample as mutant if it carries the loss of any of the regular interferon genes or gain of any of 
the 4 interferon pathway inhibitors (SOCS1, SOCS3, PIAS1 and PIAS4). There were 73 
non-responders including 3 stable disease patients and 27 responders including 9 stable 
disease patients. We analyzed the obtained 70 responders and 18 responders after excluding 
the stable disease patients in each group. WES data are currently being deposited to dbGap 
with the accession numbers pending. These data will be available to interested parties upon 
request.
Knockdown of IFNGR1 gene in murine B16 tumor cells—Lentiviral particles of 
mouse shRNA specific to IFNGR1 gene and control scramble shRNA were purchased from 
Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Transduction of B16/BL16 cells were carried out according to 
manufacturer’s instruction. Briefly, mouse melanoma B16/BL16 cells were cultured in 12-
well plate to reach 50% confluence, transduced with lentiviral particles, split into 100mm 
plates, and then selected with puromycin-containing culture medium. Single cell colonies 
were selected and expanded in puromycin-containing culture medium. RT-PCR and western 
blot were then used to confirm the extent of individual IFNGR1 gene knockdown.

 RT-PCR analysis—At indicated time points after IFN-γ treatment, total RNA was isolated 
with RNeasy Plus Micro Kit (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA) and cDNA was synthesized with 
miScript II RT Kit (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA). Expression of target genes was determined by 
7500 Fast Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) with SYBR® 
Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) according to manufacturer’s 
instructions. β-actin was used as an internal control. Each sample was examined at least in 
triplicates. PCR product specificity was confirmed by a melting-curve analysis. The relative 
mRNA expression was calculated by using 2-Δ ΔCt method. qSTAR qPCR Primer Pairs for 
RT-PCR were purchased from OriGene Technologies (Rockville, MD).
Western blot analysis—For Western blotting, cells were homogenized in RIPA buffer 
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX) plus phosphatase and protease inhibitor cocktail, 10 
mM NaF, 1 mM PMSF and 1 mM Na3VO4. Protein extracts were clarified and 
concentrations were measured with Pierce Protein Assay kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). 
Anti-IFNGR1 antibody was purchased from Novus Biologicals, Littleton, CO; β-actin (Cell 
Signaling Technology, Dnavers, MA) was used as a loading control. Goat anti-rabbit 
secondary antibodies were obtained from LI-COR Biosciences. The fluorescent signals were 
developed with Odyssey® CLx Imaging System (LI-COR Biosciences, Licoln, NE).
Cell proliferation assays—Cell proliferation in response to IFN-γ treatment was 
assessed by either the CellTiter 96 cell proliferation assay from Promega or flow cytometry. 
For the Promega’s cell proliferation assay, 2000 cells were cultured in 96-well pates, treated 
with various concentrations of IFN-γ for 72 hours, and then incubated with CellTiter 96 
AQueous One Solution Reagent for 1-4 hours per manufacturer’s protocol before recording 
the absorbance at 490 nm on SpectraMax M2 (Molecular Devices). For flow cytometry 
analysis, cell proliferation was detected using CellTrace CFSE Cell Proliferation Kit from 
ThermoFisher Scientific (Grand Island, NY), as described previously (Shi et al., 2013). 
Briefly, tumor cells were labeled with 5 μM CFSE for 20 min at 37°C and then treated with 
various doses of IFN- γ for different periods of time as specified in relevant figures. Cells 
were then washed twice and harvested to detect CSFE dilution using BD LSR II flow 
cytometer (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA). All experiments were performed in triplicates 
and repeated at least three times.
Cell apoptosis assay—Cell apoptosis was analyzed by flow cytometry, as described 
previously (Shi et al., 2013). In brief, wild-type (WT), scrambled shRNA-, or IFNGR1 
shRNA-transduced B16/BL6 melanoma cells were treated with different doses of IFN-γ (0–
1000 U/mL) for 48 h (dose-response studies). Cells were then stained with Annexin-V and 
7-AAD using Annexin V Apoptosis Detection Kit I from BD Pharmingen and detected with 
BD LSR II flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA). All experiments were 
performed in triplicates and repeated at least three times.
Tumor models, analysis and treatment—Tumor inoculation and treatment protocol 
has been previously described (Fu et al., 2011). Briefly, anesthetized mice were injected in 
the right flank intradermally with 1 x 104 B16/BL6, B16/BL6-IFNGR1 knockdown, B16/
BL6-scramble control, or wild-type B16/BL6 cells at day 0, and then treated by injecting 1 x

 106 irradiated GVAX (150 Gy) in the left flank. Gvax was given on day 3, 6, 9 after tumor 
inoculation, together with intraperitoneal injections of 200 (day 3) or 100 μg (day 6 and 9) of 
anti-CTLA-4 monoclonal antibody. Tumor growth was monitored by measuring tumor size 
with a caliper 2 to 3 times per week. Mice were euthanized when tumor size reached 1.5 cm 
in diameter, or ulceration reached 0.2 cm or moribund occurred, and recorded as death.
Isolation of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) was previously described (Fu et al., 2011). 
In brief, tumors were minced and digested with 1 mg/mL collagenase D and 200 μg/mL 
DNAse mix (Roche; Indianapolis, IN) by incubating at 37°C for 45 min with mixing every 5 
min. The digestants were then passed through 40 micron filter, loaded on Histopaque®-1077 
(Sigma) and spun at 2000 rpm for 20 min without brake. Cells at the interphase were 
collected and washed in 5% RPMI 1640 containing 1 mM EDTA. The cells were stained for 
surface expression of CD4 and CD8, as well as intracellular staining of Foxp3. Flow 
cytometry data were acquired on LSRII (BD Biosciences) and analyzed using Flowjo 
software (Tree Star).
TCGA patient survival analysis—We downloaded the level 3 CNA and clinical data for 
367 metastatic melanoma patients from the Broad Institute’s GDAC firehose website 
(https://gdac.broadinstitute.org/). Similar to the WES analysis, we used log2 tumor vs 
normal ratio > 0.7 (< −0.7) to define copy gain or loss. A patient is defined as a mutant if it 
carries the loss of any of the regular interferon genes or gain of any of the 4 interferon 
pathway inhibitors. As a result, 134 patients carry CNAs whereas the other 233 do not. We 
found that the patients with containing CNAs have significantly shorter overall survival 
(median: 40 months) than the wild-type patients (median: 48.2 months, p = 0.0018, log rank 
test).
QUALIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
All group results are expressed as mean ± SEM, if not stated otherwise. Comparisons 
between groups were made using the two-tailed Student’s T-Test, unless stated otherwise. 
Statistical significance as compared to untreated controls was denoted with * (p < 0.05), ** 
(p < 0.01), *** (p < 0.001) in the Figures and Figure legends. Statistical analysis was 
performed in Graph Pad PRISM 6.

mRNA expression of the above B16/BL6 cells treated with 1000 unit/ml of IFN-γ for 16 
hours (NS, not significant; *** P < 0.0001). (C) B16/BL6 cells as described in (A) that were 
freshly labeled with CFSE (parental cells) or CFSE-prelabeled cells that were further 
cultured for 48 h in the absence or presence of varying doses of IFN-γ were analyzed for 
CFSE expression by flow cytometry. (D) Apoptosis rate as detected by flow cytometry in 
wild-type, scramble shRNA transduced, and IFNGR1 shRNA-transduced B16/BL6 cells in 
response to increasing concentrations of IFN-γ. Data in the bar graphs are means ± SEM. 
NS: no statistical significance, *: p<0.05, **: p<0.01, ***: p<0.001 by ANOVA analysis, as 
compared to the wild-type counterparts. All data are representative of three independent 
experiments.

 Figure 4. Knockdown of IFNGR1 gene in B16/BL6 tumors promotes in vivo tumor growth and 
reduces survival in response to anti-CTLA-4 therapy
(A) In vivo tumor growth rate in B16/BL6 wild-type tumors as compared to scramble 
shRNA- and IFNGR1 shRNA-transduced tumors in mice treated with anti-CTLA-4 (lower 
panel). Upper panels are untreated controls (UnTx). (B) Tumor load of wild-type, scramble 
shRNA- and IFNGR1 shRNA-transduced tumors in mice treated with anti-CTLA-4. Data in 
the bar graphs are means ± SEM. (C) Ratio of CD8 T cells to Foxp3+ regulatory T cells in 
wild-type, scramble shRNA- and IFNGR1 shRNA-transduced tumors from mice on day 14 
post anti-CTLA-4 treatment. Data in the bar graphs are means ± SEM; **p<0.01 by

B16/BL6 wild-type tumors as compared to scramble shRNA- and IFNGR1 shRNA-
transduced tumors with and without treatment of anti-CTLA-4. All data are pooled results 
from 2–3 independent experiments.
