Abstract
 Background—Individuals with previous nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSC) are at increased 
risk for subsequent skin cancer, and should therefore limit UV exposure.
 Objective—To determine whether individuals with previous NMSC engage in better sun 
protection than those with no skin cancer history.
 Methods—We pooled self-reported data (2005 and 2010 National Health Interview Surveys) 
from US non-Hispanic white adults (758 with and 34,161 without previous NMSC). We calculated 
adjusted prevalence odds ratios (aPOR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI), taking into 
account the complex survey design.
 Results—Individuals with previous NMSC versus no history of NMSC had higher rates of 
frequent use of shade (44.3% versus 27.0%; aPOR=1.41; 1.16–1.71), long sleeves (20.5% versus 
7.7%; aPOR=1.55; 1.21–1.98), a wide-brimmed hat (26.1% versus 10.5%; aPOR=1.52; 1.24–
1.87), and sunscreen (53.7% versus 33.1%; aPOR=2.11; 95% CI=1.73–2.59), but did not have 
significantly lower odds of recent sunburn (29.7% versus 40.7%; aPOR=0.95; 0.77–1.17). Among 
subjects with previous NMSC, recent sunburn was inversely associated with age, sun avoidance, 
and shade but not sunscreen.

 INTRODUCTION
Nonmelanoma skin cancers (NMSC) are the most common of all human malignancies.1 
Individuals with previous NMSC are at increased risk for subsequent NMSC2–5 and 
melanoma.6–12 UV radiation and sunburn are the main avoidable contributing factors to 
NMSC and melanoma.1,13–15 Thus, it is advisable for individuals with previous NMSC to 
engage in sun-protective practices to help avoid harmful sun exposure and potentially 
prevent subsequent skin cancers. Two previous US studies suggest that subjects report 
engaging in better sun-protective practices after NMSC treatment;16,17 however, evidence 
suggests that certain photo-protective practices may not necessarily translate into sunburn 
prevention.18
Our study uses nationally representative US data to examine (1) whether subjects with 
previous NMSC engage in better photo-protection than subjects without history of skin 
cancer and (2) correlates of recent sunburn among subjects reporting previous NMSC.
 METHODOLOGY
 Study population
We obtained data from the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), a nationally 
representative cross-sectional survey of the US civilian non-institutionalized population that 
involves a complex survey design and population-based weights.19 As detailed in 
Supplemental Figure 1, we pooled self-reported data from 2005 (N=31,428) and 2010 
(N=27,157), the most recent survey years with our questions of interest. Final adult response 
rates for the 2005 and 2010 NHIS were 69.0%20 and 60.8%,19 respectively. Analyses were 
restricted to non-Hispanic whites (N=35,648), as NMSC primarily affects this population.21 
We excluded individuals reporting previous melanoma (N=323) regardless of history of 
NMSC, reporting skin cancer of unknown kind (N=352), or with missing responses to 
questions about previous cancer or NMSC (N=54). Our study population thus included 758 
subjects reporting previous NMSC and 34,161 subjects without history of skin cancer. This 
study was exempt from Johns Hopkins University IRB review.
 Definitions of covariates
Intuitive categories for age at interview were chosen with consideration for the low 
incidence of NMSC at younger ages. Survey responses for gender, region of the US, survey 
year, family history of skin cancer in any first-degree relative, highest level of education, and

 previous full-body skin examination were reported. Sun sensitivity was characterized as the 
effect of going out into the sun for an hour without photo-protection on the skin after several 
months of not being in the sun very much. Included responses were (a) “get a severe sunburn 
with blisters,” (b) “have a moderate sunburn with peeling,” (c) “burn mildly with some or no 
darkening/tanning,” (d) “turn darker without sunburn,” (e) “nothing would happen to my 
skin,” or (f) “do not go out in the sun.” Survey questions quantifying sun exposure were not 
available, thus we included surrogate variables (BMI and physical activity level). For 
physical activity level, we summed the reported minutes of mild-to-moderate and vigorous 
activity per week and created categories (0, <180, 180–360, 360+ minutes/week) using cut-
points corresponding approximately to the 50th and 75th percentiles among subjects 
reporting physical activity.
 Definitions of outcome variables
Survey respondents were asked four separate questions regarding how often they (1) stay in 
the shade, (2) wear a hat that shades their face, ears, and neck, such as a hat with a wide 
brim all around, (3) wear a long sleeved shirt, and (4) use sunscreen, when they go outside 
on a warm sunny day for more than one hour. For each of the four questions, we included 
responses of always, most of the time, sometimes, rarely, never, or “do not go out in the 
sun”. We defined sun avoidance as a response of “do not go out in the sun” to any of five 
questions regarding sunscreen, long sleeves, hat, shade, or sun sensitivity. Among the 
remaining sun-exposed individuals (did not avoid the sun), we examined responses for 
questions 1–4 categorized as frequent (always or most of the time), sometimes, or rare 
(rarely or never). We defined individuals with frequent multimodal sun protection as sun-
exposed individuals who reported frequent use of at least two of the four examined sun-
protective methods (questions 1–4). Recent sunburn was characterized as sunburn within the 
last 12 months.
 Statistical analysis
We performed multivariate logistic regression to estimate prevalence odds ratios (PORs) for 
the outcome variables using previous NMSC (compared to no history of skin cancer) as the 
main exposure variable. We selected covariates for adjustment a priori based on their known 
association with the primary outcomes and/or UV-exposure behaviors, including age, sex, 
region, family history of skin cancer, sun sensitivity, education, BMI, and physical 
activity.22–26 Refused, not ascertained, and unknown responses were coded collectively as 
missing for the above analysis. Frequencies of missing subjects were reported for descriptive 
(Supplemental Table 1) and sun-protective variables (Table 1). Additional logistic regression 
was performed for stratified analyses by descriptive variables and for subpopulation analyses 
restricted to subjects reporting previous NMSC with complete data (additionally adjusting 
for previous full-body skin examination). As a portion of survey respondents reported 
previous skin cancer of unknown type, we conducted sensitivity analyses looking at subjects 
reporting previous NMSC and skin cancer of unknown type together compared to subjects 
without history of skin cancer to examine whether point estimates for photo-protection 
would change if all skin cancers of unknown type had also been NMSC. We computed the 
Ptrend using the Wald statistic treating categorized exposure variables as continuous. Sample 
weights were adjusted by dividing each sample weight by 2 (the number of pooled years).19

 All analyses were performed (SAS 9.4, Cary, NC) taking into account the adjusted sample 
weights, complex survey design, and differing 2005 and 2010 sample designs.19
 RESULTS
Descriptive characteristics among subjects with and without previous NMSC are reported in 
Supplemental Table 1. Table 1 shows the percentage of all subjects with versus without 
previous NMSC reporting recent sunburn (29.7% versus 40.7%) and sun avoidance (12.8% 
versus 7.3%). Among sun-exposed individuals, we report the percentage of subjects with 
versus without previous NMSC reporting frequent use of shade (44.3% versus 27.0%), long 
sleeves (20.5% versus 7.7%), a wide-brimmed hat (26.1% versus 10.5%), sunscreen (53.7% 
versus 33.1%), and multi-modal sun protection (44.7% versus 19.4%; Table 1). The crude 
percentage difference in sunburn between subjects with and without previous NMSC 
disappeared after stratification by age (Figure 1a). Approximately two-thirds (66.9%) of 
individuals aged 18–39 with previous NMSC reported recent sunburn (Figure 1a). The 
proportion of individuals reporting recent sunburn decreased with age among subjects with 
and without previous NMSC (Ptrend<0.001 for both groups; Figure 1a), while use of 
multimodal sun protection increased significantly with age among subjects reporting no 
history of skin cancer (Ptrend<0.001; Figure 1b). Among individuals employing multimodal 
sun protection, frequent sunscreen use decreased with age (Ptrend<0.001; Supplemental 
Table 2).
Among sun-exposed individuals, previous NMSC (compared to no history of skin cancer) 
was associated with higher odds of frequent use (versus rare or sometimes use) of shade 
(adjusted prevalence odds ratio (aPOR)=1.41; 95% CI=1.16–1.71), long sleeves 
(aPOR=1.55; 1.21–1.98), a wide-brimmed hat (aPOR=1.52; 1.24–1.87), and sunscreen 
(aPOR=2.11; 1.73–2.59) on a warm sunny day (Table 2). Previous NMSC was also 
associated with multimodal sun protection (aPOR=2.49; 1.93–3.22). Previous NMSC was 
not significantly associated with higher odds of sun avoidance (aPOR=1.30; 0.77–2.19) or 
lower odds of recent sunburn (aPOR=0.95; 0.77–1.17) among all subjects after multivariate 
adjustment (Table 2). The association between previous NMSC and sunburn remained non-
significant even after stratification by age, sex, region, family history of skin cancer, sun 
sensitivity, education, BMI, physical activity, and survey year (results not shown). 
Sensitivity analysis looking at subjects reporting previous NMSC and skin cancer of 
unknown type together compared to subjects with no history of skin cancer did not 
substantially impact point estimates (results not shown).
Among all subjects with previous NMSC, recent sunburn was associated with younger age, 
residence outside of the South, previous full-body skin examination, and increasing sun 
sensitivity (Table 3). Recent sunburn was inversely associated with sun avoidance 
(aPOR=0.3; 0.1–0.9) among all subjects with previous NMSC (Table 4). Among sun-
exposed individuals with previous NMSC, recent sunburn was associated with less frequent 
use of shade (Ptrend<0.001) and long sleeves (Ptrend=0.02), but not a wide-brimmed hat 
(Ptrend=0.06) or sunscreen (Ptrend=0.75; Table 4). Using more modes of frequent photo-
protection was associated with decreasing odds of recent sunburn (Ptrend=0.001; Table 4).

  DISCUSSION
Individuals reporting previous NMSC reported similar relative odds of recent sunburn 
compared to individuals without history of skin cancer, despite having better sun-protective 
practices. Our findings are supported by a recent study showing no significant difference in 
reported rates of sunburn between subjects with and without any previous skin cancer.27 
Smaller studies looking at patients before and four months after NMSC treatment have 
similarly shown significant improvements in the use of shade,16 protective clothing,16 
hats,16,17 and sunscreen.17
Approximately 30% of non-Hispanic whites reporting previous NMSC identified having 
recently sunburned. In recent literature, similar rates of sunburn were found in a Canadian 
study post-melanoma,28 while higher rates were reported among northern Australian men 
post-NMSC.29 We observed even higher rates of sunburn in the younger population. 
Previous studies have observed associations of previous NMSC with subsequent skin 
cancer,2–12 cumulative sun exposure with risk of NMSC,30–34 and sunburn at any age with 
melanoma.13–15 Thus, these high rates of sunburn are concerning in the young post-NMSC 
population, as younger subjects have more years to accumulate harmful sun exposure. We 
generally observed increasing use of multimodal photo-protection with age, despite the 
oldest populations possibly experiencing less relative benefit with regard to increased 
longevity. Our findings suggest that the observed decrease in sunburn with age may result 
from increased photo-protection in addition to less engagement in activities with sun 
exposure.35 Among users of multimodal photo-protection, frequent sunscreen use decreased 
with age, which may reflect that sunscreen application is often a more active decision in the 
older population than dressing in protective clothing.
Overall, subjects reporting previous NMSC more frequently engage in photo-protective 
practices reducing chronic UV exposure, which may help reduce the risk of subsequent 
NMSC.30–34 However, their sun-protective practices may still not be consistent enough to 
prevent acute episodes of UV exposure leading to sunburns, which are associated with risk 
of melanoma and BCC.13–15 Physicians should thus continue to emphasize the importance 
of sunburn prevention, especially among younger individuals with previous NMSC. It is 
important to consider that individuals with previous NMSC likely had higher UV exposure 
compared to the general population before NMSC diagnosis, and thus improved sun-
protective practices post-NMSC may have contributed to returning their rates of sunburn 
back to rates comparable to the general population.
Among individuals reporting previous NMSC, risk factors associated with recent sunburn 
included younger age, residence outside of the South, increasing sun sensitivity, and lack of 
previous full-body skin examination. This association with age is consistent with previous 
studies.29,25 The observed association with previous full-body skin examination may be due 
in part to counseling from health care providers about photo-protection, or conversely if 
subjects who engage in photo-protection are more proactive about skin cancer screening. 
The association between region and recent sunburn may be explained in part by better 
photo-protection counseling at lower latitudes in the U.S.36

 Sun avoidance and frequent use of shade were associated with the largest reduction in odds 
of recent sunburn among subjects with previous NMSC; however, we observed the smallest 
magnitudes of association between previous NMSC and these behaviors. Interestingly, while 
frequent use of sunscreen was the most commonly employed sun-protective method, it was 
not associated with lower odds of recent sunburn among subjects with previous NMSC, 
suggesting that individuals may not necessarily be effectively applying sunscreen. Other 
studies similarly suggest that sunscreen alone may not provide adequate protection from 
harmful sun exposure,18,37,38 as sunscreen use correlates with more overall sun 
exposure,39,40 sunscreen application may be too thin,39,41 areas of skin may be left 
unprotected after application.40,42 Additionally, intermittent sunscreen use may result in skin 
that is not as hardened from chronic UV exposure and more susceptible to acute episodes of 
sun exposure resulting in sunburn. As the most effective methods of photo-protection may 
not be the most common methods used among subjects with previous NMSC, this 
discrepancy may help explain the similar relative odds of recent sunburn in subjects with 
versus without previous NMSC. Thus, use of effective protective methods such as sun 
avoidance and shade should be advised. Additionally, we believe that emphasizing patient 
counseling about proper sunscreen application could increase effectiveness of sunscreen 
application in preventing sunburn. As sunscreen is the most common form of photo-
protection employed, improving the effectiveness of sunscreen could have a large impact on 
decreasing unnecessary sunburn. Multimodality of sun protection was associated with lower 
odds of sunburn and thus may offer a highly beneficial approach to prevent sunburns in 
individuals with previous NMSC.
Strengths of this study include the large sample size using a nationally representative 
sample. Pooling multiple years of data allowed for increased precision of estimates, 
especially among smaller subpopulations.
Limitations include the cross-sectional study design with reliance on current sun-protective 
practices and lack of data quantifying sun exposure (e.g., at midday) in the survey 
questionnaire, although we attempted to address residual confounding by examining 
physical activity level and BMI. Additionally, pooling multiple years of data may make 
findings less generalizable to a specific year, and as much of the data is old (up to 10 years), 
the accuracy of the data representing the current US population may be limited. The data is 
self-reported and recall bias is possible, as those with previous NMSC may better remember 
sunburn or photo-protection if their physician advised being mindful of photo-protection; 
however, our estimates are consistent and agree with smaller studies with short-term follow-
up.16,17 An additional limitation is the use of non-confirmed NMSC cases, as the NHIS is 
thought to underreport cases.43,44 While melanoma is generally recognized as serious, 
certain individuals may perceive their NMSC diagnosis as less important and may therefore 
be less likely to report NMSC. This would further underscore the need to better emphasize 
sun-protection in this at-risk population. Survey information on subtype of NMSC and 
sunburn severity was not available. It is possible that despite similar odds of recent sunburn 
in subjects with and without previous NMSC, sunburn among subjects with previous NMSC 
was less severe. Prospective studies are still needed to examine relative photo-protective 
behaviors and risk of sunburn post-NMSC in the context of both prior photo-protective 
behaviors and current UV exposures and to examine whether proper photo-protection and

 sunburn prevention will help reduce the risk of subsequent skin cancers in the population 
with previous NMSC.
 CONCLUSIONS
Among non-Hispanic whites, we observe that individuals with previous NMSC engage in 
better sun-protective practices but not sunburn prevention compared to subjects with no 
history of skin cancer, suggesting that photo-protection may still not be consistent enough to 
prevent acute sun exposure leading to sunburn. Physicians should thus continue to 
emphasize the importance of sunburn prevention, especially among younger individuals with 
previous NMSC. Sun avoidance (including shade) may be a more effective means of photo-
protection than use of sunscreen in subjects with previous NMSC, and should thus be 
emphasized when counseling patients. However, due to the commonness of sunscreen use, 
counseling efforts on ways to improve sunscreen effectiveness could also have a large public 
health impact in preventing sunburn.

A. Percentage of subjects reporting sunburn in the last year according to age. B. Percentage 
of subjects reporting frequent multimodal sun protection according to age. Data are pooled 
from the 2005 and 2010 NHIS. Percentages are weighted according to US census data and 
reported with standard error (SE) measurements. P-values for linear trend (Ptrend) were 
calculated using logistic regression treating age categories as a continuous variable. Point 
estimates are reported in Supplemental Table 3 (sunburn) and Supplemental Table 4

The analysis was conducted using pooled data from the 2005 and 2010 NHIS among non-Hispanic white subjects
aSubjects who reported no history of skin cancer were used as the reference group
bPrevalence odds ratio (POR) estimates were adjusted for age (18–39, 40–49, 50–59, 60–69, 70–79, 80+ years), sex, region (Northeast, Midwest, 
South, West), family history of skin cancer, sun sensitivity (severe sunburn, moderate sunburn, mild sunburn, no sunburn, no change), highest level 
of education (less than high school, high school diploma, some college, college degree or higher), BMI (<18.5, 18.5–<25.0, 25.0–<30.0, 30.0+ 
kg/m2), physical activity level (0, <180, 180–<360, 360+ min/wk), and survey year (2005, 2010).
cOutcome variable: at least one sunburn in the last year versus none; this model included all study subjects and thus the covariate of sun sensitivity 
included the additional response of “do not go into sun.”
dOutcome variable; model not adjusted for sun sensitivity because the covariate was used to create the outcome variable
eOutcome variable: frequent use versus rare or sometimes use on a warm sunny day
fOutcome variable: frequent use of at least two of the four sun protection methods examined among sun-exposed subjects versus fewer than two 
methods
