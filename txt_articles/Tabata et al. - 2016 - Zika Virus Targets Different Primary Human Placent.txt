In Brief
Zika virus (ZIKV) infects the fetus during
pregnancy, causing devastating birth
defects. Tabata et al. show that ZIKV
infects numerous primary cell types and
explants of the human placenta,
suggesting placental and paraplacental
routes of virus transmission. Virus
infection is blocked by duramycin, an
inhibitor of the ZIKV cofactor TIM1.

SUMMARY
Zika virus (ZIKV) infection during pregnancy is linked
to severe birth defects, but mother-to-fetus trans-
mission routes are unknown. We infected different
primary cell types from mid- and late-gestation pla-
centas and explants from first-trimester chorionic
villi with the prototype Ugandan and a recently iso-
lated Nicaraguan ZIKV strain. ZIKV infects primary
human placental cells and explants—cytotropho-
blasts, endothelial cells, fibroblasts, and Hofbauer
cells in chorionic villi and amniotic epithelial cells
and trophoblast progenitors in amniochorionic mem-
branes—that express Axl, Tyro3, and/or TIM1 viral
entry cofactors. ZIKV produced NS3 and E proteins
and generated higher viral titers in amniotic epithelial
cells from mid-gestation compared to late-gestation
placentas. Duramycin, a peptide that binds phos-
phatidylethanolamine in enveloped virions and pre-
cludes TIM1 binding, reduced ZIKV infection in
placental cells and explants. Our results suggest
that ZIKV spreads from basal and parietal decidua
to chorionic villi and amniochorionic membranes
and that targeting TIM1 could suppress infection at
the uterine-placental interface.
INTRODUCTION
Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus that was relatively
obscure until outbreaks in Yap and French Polynesia in 2007 and
2013, respectively, and the 2015–2016 pandemic expanding
rapidly from Brazil across the Americas brought it to worldwide
attention. In the United States, 691 imported cases and 11 cases
of confirmed sexual transmission have been reported (http://
www.cdc.gov/zika/geo/united-states.html). ZIKV is linked to se-
vere birth defects and Guillain-Barre
´ syndrome (Cao-Lormeau
et al., 2016; Sarno et al., 2016), and in February of 2016, the
World Health Organization declared the Zika pandemic a Public
Health Emergency of International Concern (http://www.who.
int/mediacentre/news/statements/2016/emergency-committee-
zika-microcephaly/en/). However, little is known about the
causal mechanisms. Mounting evidence indicates that infection
in early gestation can lead to miscarriage, stillbirth, intrauterine
growth restriction (IUGR), and microcephaly, a malformation of
the fetal brain (Brasil et al., 2016; Mlakar et al., 2016); however,
infection of the mother in the second or third trimester and pro-
longed viremia could contribute to fetal abnormalities (Brasil
et al., 2016; Driggers et al., 2016). ZIKV has been detected in
brain glia and neurons, placenta, and amniotic fluid of babies
with microcephaly, further linking infection during pregnancy to
congenital disease (Mlakar et al., 2016; Rasmussen et al.,
2016). How ZIKV infects the placenta and reaches the fetal
compartment is unknown.
In early gestation, trophoblasts from chorionic villi of the
placenta develop into two major cell types, syncytiotrophoblasts
(STBs), which cover the villus surface, and cytotrophoblasts
(CTBs). Villus CTBs proliferate and switch from an epithelial to
an endothelial phenotype, differentiate, invade the uterine wall,
and remodel uterine arteries (Zhou et al., 1997). Chorionic villi an-
chor the placenta to the uterus and channel blood from circula-
tion to the maternal blood space. To maintain immune tolerance
to the hemiallogeneic placenta, natural killer cells, macrophages,
and dendritic cells emigrate to the basal decidua, attracted by
chemokine-receptor networks (Red-Horse et al., 2001). Oppo-
site the basal decidua, where chorionic villi are anchored, a
much larger portion of the uterine wall is lined by the parietal
decidua. By 15 weeks gestation, the parietal decidua is in con-
tact with the chorionic membrane, which is fused to the amniotic
membrane lined on the fetal side by amniotic epithelial cells
(AmEpCs) (Benirschke and Kaufmann, 2000). Trophoblast pro-
genitor cells (TBPCs) in the chorion differentiate into invasive
CTBs that migrate into the parietal decidua and attach the
amniochorionic membranes to the uterus (Genba�
cev et al.,
2015). The parietal decidua contains maternal blood vessels
and lymphatic vessels and functions as a paraplacental ex-
change organ that filters fluid from maternal circulation via the
chorion and contributes to maintenance of equilibrium in the fetal
compartment. As pregnancy advances and the fetus grows, the
chorionic surface of the amniochorionic membrane adjoins the
parietal decidua across almost the entire uterine surface.
Flaviviruses bind to a variety of surface molecules that serve
as entry mediators or cofactors (Perera-Lecoin et al., 2013).
Recently, dengue virus (DENV) was shown to bind the TAM family
Cell Host & Microbe 20, 155–166, August 10, 2016 ª 2016 Elsevier Inc.
155
 of tyrosine kinase receptors—Tyro3, Axl, and Mertk—which clear
apoptotic cells (Meertens et al., 2012) and regulate innate im-
mune functions (Lemke and Rothlin, 2008; Rothlin et al., 2007).
TAM is activated by ligands that bind phosphatidylserine (PS) in
membranes of apoptotic cells and can form bridges between vi-
rions and TAM. DENV also binds TIM1, a member of the T cell
immunoglobulin and mucin domain protein family that regulates
innate and adaptive immune functions and cell survival (Freeman
et al., 2010). Axl and Tyro3 and, to a lesser extent, TIM1 serve as
entry cofactors for DENV (Meertens et al., 2012; Perera-Lecoin
et al., 2013), and it was demonstrated that TIM1 directly binds
PS and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) in the virion envelope of
dengue, West Nile, and Ebola viruses (Jemielity et al., 2013;
Richard et al., 2015). A recent ZIKV isolate was shown to infect
human dermal fibroblasts, epidermal keratinocytes, and imma-
ture DCs, with DC-SIGN, Axl, Tyro3, and TIM1 facilitating entry
and Axl playing a major role (Hamel et al., 2015).
In the present study, we took advantage of our previous work
on human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection in the developing
placenta and primary cells expressing viral receptors (Fisher
et al., 2000; Maidji et al., 2007; Tabata et al., 2007, 2015; Zydek
et al., 2014) to understand how ZIKV infection and transmission
from mother to fetus occur. We hypothesized that, like HCMV,
hematogenous spread of ZIKV entails infection of cells at
sites in the uterus perfused by maternal blood—decidua and
placenta—and by amniotic fluid, which bathes the amniotic
membrane and fetus. To test this possibility, we isolated different
primary cell types from mid- and late-gestation placentas and
established explants from first-trimester chorionic villi, and we
found that placental cells and explants were highly infectable
with the prototype Ugandan ZIKV strain and new 2016 ZIKV
isolates from the current epidemic in Nicaragua. Cell types
susceptible to ZIKV replication expressed Axl, Tyro3, and TIM1
cofactors to varying degrees, and immunohistological and
immunoblot analyses of placental biopsy specimens and pri-
mary cells confirmed that expression varied by cell type, donor,
differentiation state, and gestational age. Notably, TIM1 was
consistently and highly expressed throughout the basal decidua
and parietal decidua, chorionic villi, and amniochorionic mem-
branes surrounding the fetus, and in AmEpCs that were produc-
tively infected and released high virus titers. Duramycin, a cyclic
19-aa peptide that specifically binds PE, potently blocked ZIKV
infection in all primary placental cells and chorionic villus ex-
plants, indicating that TIM1 plays a critical role in infection and
suggesting strategies for clinical management.
RESULTS
ZIKV Infects Primary Human Placental Cells from Mid-
and Late Gestation and Chorionic Villus Explants from
Early Gestation
To determine whether ZIKV infects primary cells from the human
placenta, isolated AmEpCs from mid- and late-gestation amniotic
membranes, TBPCs from chorion, and HPFs and CTBs from cho-
rionic villi were isolated from donors (n = 20). These cells, along
with a primary human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC)
line from umbilical cord, were infected with prototype ZIKV strain
MR766 and, at 72 hr post-infection, were immunostained with
monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) to E glycoprotein (Figure 1Ai–v)
and nonstructural protein NS3 (Figure 1Avi–x), which is not
secreted and is widely used as a marker for flavivirus replication.
AmEpCs (Figure 1Ai, ii, vi, and vii) were highly susceptible to
ZIKV, as indicated by expression of E and NS3, while infection
of TBPCs (Figure 1Aiii and viii), HPFs (Figure 1Aiv and ix), HUVECs
(Figure1Avandx),andCTBs(FigureS1,availableonline)occurred
in single cells and/or discrete foci. Productivity of primary cell
infection was indicated byrelease ofinfectious progenyquantified
by plaque and focus-forming assays (FFAs) (Table S1). Most pro-
ductive were AmEpCs, which released high titers (105–107) at low
MOI (0.001) ascomparedwithTBPCs,HPFs,HUVECs,andCTBs,
which were infected at higher MOI (1–2).
Having found that primary AmEpCs from mid- and late-gesta-
tion placentas were susceptible to ZIKV infection, these cells
were infected with clinical isolates Nica1-16 and Nica2-16 in
parallel with MR766. Nica1-16 and Nica2-16 were isolated in
Nicaragua in January 2016; full-length sequencing confirmed
their close relationship to the Brazil 2015–2016 strains. Like
MR766, Nica1-16 readily infected AmEpCs at low MOI, ex-
pressed E (Figure 1Bi and ii) and NS3 (Figure 1Biii and iv), and
produced high titers at 3, 5, and 7 dpi (days post-infection) (Table
S1). Interestingly, AmEpCs from mid-gestation placentas pro-
duced 6- to 8-fold higher titers than those from late-gestation
placentas at 5–7 dpi when infected with MR766 (Figure 2A),
Nica1-16 (Figure 2B), or Nica2-16 (Figure 2C). Similarly, ZIKV
release from Nica1-16-infected AmEpCs titered on human
ARPE-19 cells was �4-fold greater in mid-gestation than in
late-gestation cells at 5–7 dpi (Figure 2D).
We next cultured chorionic villus explants from first-trimester
placentas (n = 4), infected with MR766 or Nica1-16, and immu-
nostained for ZIKV E and NS3 at 3 dpi (Figure 1Ci and ii). Low
magnification (middle) showed E and NS3 proteins in a focus
of proliferating villus CTBs (cytokeratin [CK] and Ki67 positive).
Approximately 15 CTBs near the villus core were infected, and
both strong and weak staining were observed, suggesting cell-
to-cell spread (Figures 1Ci and ii and S2H–S2S). ZIKV-infected
CTBs expressed CK, but did not express Ki67, indicating they
were no longer proliferating (Figures 1Ciii, S2J, S2M, S2P, and
S2S). Invasive CTBs were also infected, expressed E and NS3
proteins, and continued to express CK (Figure 1Di, ii, iv, and v)
and MHC class I HLA-G, a differentiation antigen (Figure 1Diii
and vi). ZIKV proteins were also detected in villus CTBs and
numerous small foci with two to four infected cells (Figures
S2N–S2S). Detailed examination of the explants indicated that
STBs did not produce ZIKV NS3 protein and were not infected,
although E glycoprotein was detected in small cytoplasmic ves-
icles (data not shown). In villus explants infected with Nica1-16,
Hofbauer cells in the villus core were infected and expressed E
and NS3 proteins (Figure 1Ei, ii, iv, and v) and CD68 (Figure 1Eiii
and vi). Likewise, MR766 infected Hofbauer cells in villus ex-
plants (Figures S2B–S2G). Titers of infectious progeny released
from chorionic villus explants infected with MR766 or Nica1-16
were quantified in ARPE-19 cells and ranged from 2 3 103
PFU (plaque-forming units) to 1 3 105 PFU.
Together, these results show that different types of primary
cells from mid- and late-gestation placentas are permissive to
infection with prototype and contemporary ZIKV strains. Further,
in the tissue environment of early gestation chorionic villus ex-
plants, proliferating villus CTBs in proximal cell columns were
156

 infected, after which proliferation was arrested. Differentiating/
invasive CTBs and Hofbauer cells in the villus core were also
key targets of infection.

sion could be modulated during cell isola-
tion and culture in vitro. To this end,
immunoblotting was used to measure
expression of these cofactors in CTBs,
amniotic membranes, isolated AmEpCs,
and low-passage TBPCs, HPFs, and
HUVECs.
In CTBs isolated from mid-gestation
placentas, cofactor expression varied
considerably during differentiation from
0 to 96 hr (Figure 3A). Axl was either upre-
gulated or not expressed, while Tyro3
levels were generally low. In contrast,
TIM1 showed moderate or strong expres-
sion that declined over time. In late-
gestation CTBs, TIM1 expression was
strong and detected throughout differen-
tiation, in contrast to Axl and Tyro3 (Figure 3A). Titers from
MR766- and Nica1-16-infected CTBs were about 100-fold lower
than titers from mid-gestation CTBs (Table S1). TIM1 was
strongly produced in trophoblast cell lines (JEG-3 and HTR8)
that are highly infected by ZIKV (Bayer et al., 2016; Miner et al.,
2016), but Axl was not expressed by JEG-3 cells (Figure 3B). In
intact amniotic membranes from late gestation, little or no Axl
was detected (Figure 3C); however, in cells newly isolated from
Cell Host & Microbe 20, 155–166, August 10, 2016

 these membranes and subsequently at passage 0 (P0), faster-
migrating forms of Axl were present, and a high molecular weight
form was strongly upregulated at P1. Tyro3 was initially weakly
expressed but in some cases strongly upregulated after isolation
(Figure 3C). In contrast, TIM1 was consistently and strongly
expressed in both intact amniotic membranes and isolated
AmEpCs from all donors (Figure 3C). Next, we compared
cofactor expression in AmEpCs from mid- and late-gestation
placentas (Figure 3D). Axl was produced by AmEpCs from
eleven of thirteen donors, but two mid-gestation donors made
faster-migrating forms, and Tyro3 was not expressed in four do-
nors (Figure 3D; Table S3). Uniformly robust TIM1 expression
was found in AmEpCs from all donors. In TBPCs isolated from
early and mid-gestation chorionic membranes, Axl and Tyro3
were weakly expressed in early gestation and strongly in late
gestation, whereas TIM1 expression was robust throughout (Fig-
ure 3E). In HPFs and HUVECs, Axl was strong, Tyro3 varied, and
TIM1 expression was moderate (Figure 3F).
We next used immunofluorescence to visualize the subcellular
localization of Axl and TIM1. Axl was concentrated at plasma
membranes and perinuclear sites in mid-gestation AmEpCs;
however, abundant perinuclear and vesicular staining was
detected in late gestation (Figure 3G). TIM1 was concentrated
in plasma membranes in mid-gestation AmEpCs, but diffuse
nuclear and cytoplasmic staining increased in late gestation (Fig-
ure 3H). Immunostaining of first-trimester chorionic villus ex-
plants showed that TIM1 was expressed in villus CTBs and
Hofbauer cells (CD68 positive) (Figure S2A). In summary, immu-
noblot and immunofluorescence studies showed that TIM1, a
potential cofactor for ZIKV infection, was expressed in CTB
and trophoblast cell lines and strongly in amniotic membranes
and in primary AmEpCs isolated from all mid- and late-gestation
placentas and in early gestation chorionic villi. In contrast, Axl
and Tyro3 expression differed by cell type and donor and was
modulated in culture and as cells differentiated in vitro.
Potential Cofactors for ZIKV Infection Are Present at the
Uterine-Placental Interface
Axl was reported to play a major role in ZIKV infection in human
keratinocytes (Hamel et al., 2015). To determine whether Axl was
present in the decidua, placenta, and fetal membranes, biopsy
specimens from mid-gestation were co-stained for Axl and the
cellular proteins vimentin (fibroblasts), cytokeratin (CTB), CD68
(Hofbauer cells/fetal macrophages), and CD31 (endothelial cells
in blood vessels). In basal decidua, Axl was expressed in
decidual cells (Figure 4A) and a subset of deeply invasive
CTBs (Figure 4B). In chorionic villi of the adjacent placenta, Axl
was present in Hofbauer cells/macrophages (Figure 4C), endo-
thelial cells in blood vessels (Figure 4D), and HPFs in the villus
core (Figure 4E). In amniochorionic membranes, Axl was
expressed in AmEpCs and TBPCs (Figure 4F). Interestingly,
the intensity of Axl expression depended on location, especially
in invasive CTBs in decidua (Figures 4A and 4B), Hofbauer cells,
and HPFs (Figures 4C and 4E), suggesting responses to the tis-
sue environment. Modulation of cofactors was also shown by
immunoblot analysis of differentiating CTBs from various donors
that upregulated Axl as they invaded extracellular matrix in vitro
(Figure 3A).
To determine whether potential cofactors for ZIKV infection
were expressed in vivo, we surveyed a library of biopsy speci-
mens from 30 mid- and late-gestation placentas for Axl, Tyro3,
and TIM1. Multiple tissue sections were screened from amnio-
chorionic membranes, chorionic villi of the placenta, basal
decidua, and parietal decidua. Detailed examination indicated
that expression of specific cofactors depended on the donor,
location of cells in tissues, and gestational age (Figure 5; Table
S2). The strength of Axl signal varied and was absent from
some mid-gestation and all late-gestation amniotic membranes
(Figures 5A, 5D, 5G, and 5P) and smaller chorionic villi (Figure 5J);
however, basal decidua and parietal decidua were positive (Fig-
ures 5M and 5S; Table S2). Tyro3 was present in amniotic epithe-
lium (Figures 5B, 5E, 5H, and 5Q) and in basal and parietal
decidua (Figures 5N and 5T), but not in chorionic villi (Figure 5K).
In contrast, TIM1 was strongly and consistently expressed in all
tissues of mid- and late-gestation placentas—amniotic epithe-
lium (Figures 5C, 5F, 5I, and 5R), STBs, Hofbauer cells, and
HPFs in chorionic villi (Figure 5L); decidual cells and invasive
CTBs in basal decidua (Figure 5O); and TBPCs in chorion—
and was dramatically induced in the population of differentiating
CTBs that invade the parietal decidua (Figure 5U).
Table S3 summarizes results of immunoblot and immunostain-
ing experiments in isolated cells and biopsy specimens of pla-
centas from mid- and late gestation. TIM1 was consistently
and strongly expressed on cells throughout the uterine-placental
interface in basal and parietal decidua, chorionic villi, and

TIM1 Inhibitor Blocks ZIKV Infection across Placental
Cell Types and Reduces Infection in Chorionic Villus
Explants
Having found that ZIKV infects primary cells from chorionic villi
and amniochorionic membranes that express Axl and TIM1,
we considered they could function as cofactors. Although Axl
was variably expressed and absent from amniotic membranes
in late gestation (Figures 5A, 5D, 5G, and 5P; Tables S2 and
S3), we tested the effects of the Axl-specific tyrosine kinase in-
hibitor R428 on ZIKV infection. At the highest concentration
tested (3.0 mM), R428 reduced infection of AmEpCs by MR766
and Nica2-16 by �40%–50% (Figures 6A and 6B).
Since TIM1 was consistently made by all permissive cell types
and was broadly expressed at the uterine-placental interface by
all donors (Figures 5C, 5F, 5I, 5L, 5O, 5R, and 5U; Tables S2 and
S3), we performed infection-blocking experiments using dura-
mycin, a cyclic peptide that binds PE and inhibits infection by
DENV, a close relative of ZIKV, in cells that express TIM1 (Richard

 et al., 2015). ZIKV MR766 was incubated with increasing con-
centrations of duramycin and added to AmEpCs. Immunofluo-
rescence assays revealed a striking reduction in ZIKV NS3-ex-
pressing cells in the range of 0.2 mM to 1 mM duramycin; few
NS3-expressing cells were detected after treatment with
R0.2 mM duramycin (Figure 6C). Quantification of NS3-express-
ing AmEpCs showed that duramycin potently blocked ZIKV
infection in cells from mid- (22.6 weeks) and late- (40.2 weeks)
gestation placentas (Figure 6Di). Likewise, when duramycin-
treated MR766 was added to placental TBPCs, HPFs, and
HUVECs, infection was reduced by >50% with 0.1 mM and
>95% with 0.2 mM duramycin, even at 10-fold higher MOI (Fig-
ure 6Dii). Similar results were obtained when AmEpCs (Figure
6Diii) and invasive CTBs (data not shown) were infected with
Nica1-16 treated with duramycin. Titration of infectious progeny
released from both mid- and late-gestation AmEpCs showed that
0.2–1 mM duramycin significantly reduced virus titers (Figure 6E).
To determine whether duramycin affects ZIKV infection in the
tissue environment, chorionic villus explants from first-trimester
placentas were infected with untreated (n = 2) or 1 mM duramy-
cin-treated (n = 2) MR766 (1 3 106 PFU) 2 hr after plating, and in-
fectious progeny were titered in ARPE-19 cells. Titers were
reduced from 1 3 105 PFU/mL in the explants infected with un-
treated ZIKV to 4 3 103 and 0 PFU/mL in the explants infected
with duramycin-treated virus. Together, these studies show
that duramycin blocks ZIKV infection of numerous primary
placental cell types from mid- and late gestation, whereas the
Axl inhibitor was far less effective in blocking infection. More-
over, duramycin reduces ZIKV infection in chorionic villus
explants from early gestation placentas.
DISCUSSION
In this study, we show that ZIKV prototype strain MR766
and recent ZIKV isolates from the current Zika pandemic
infect numerous human primary cells—AmEpCs, CTBs, TBPCs,
HPFs, and HUVECs—isolated from mid- and late-gestation pla-
centas and produce infectious progeny. In explants of chorionic
villi from first-trimester placentas, ZIKV infected proliferating vil-
lus CTBs, invasive CTBs, and Hofbauer cells in the villus core
and expressed E and NS3 proteins, indicating viral replication.
Of note, ZIKV-infected CTBs no longer proliferated. Virus titers
were dependent on cell type and gestational age, as mid-gesta-
tion AmEpCs produced significantly higher titers than late-gesta-
tion cells. Analysis of biopsy specimens revealed sites at the
uterine-placental interface with strong and consistent TIM1
expression in cells where maternal blood perfuses the placenta.
These include the basal decidua and adjacent chorionic villi (Fig-
ure 7, left) and the parietal decidua, lining most of the uterus and
adjacent to amniochorionic membranes surrounding the fetus
(Figure 7, right). Expression of other potential cofactors, Axl
and Tyro3, varied by donor, location of susceptible cell types
within biopsy specimens, and gestational age. Infection of iso-
lated placental cells was potently inhibited by duramycin, a 19-
aa cyclic peptide that specifically binds PE in the virion envelope
and blocks infection of the closely related DENV (Richard et al.,
2015). Duramycin blocked ZIKV infection of primary placental
CTBs that contact maternal blood circulation and AmEpCs in
amniotic fluid and reduced infection in the tissue environment
of early gestation chorionic villus explants, potentially by pre-
cluding binding of ZIKV to TIM1, a cofactor we showed was
universally expressed across the uterine-placental interface
throughout gestation. In contrast, an inhibitor of Axl, reported
to be a cofactor for ZIKV in dermal and epidermal cells (Hamel
et al., 2015), modestly reduced infection, suggesting a second-
ary contribution in placental cells.
Figure 7 shows a model of the uterine-placental interface and
identifies the type and location of primary cells infected in vitro,
suggesting sites of viral replication and identifying placental
and paraplacental routes of ZIKV transmission to the fetus. The
basal decidua, the first zone of contact between the uterus
and adjacent placenta, develops as placental CTBs invade the
uterine wall and remodel blood vessels. The opposed parietal
decidua, the second zone of contact between the uterus
and fetal membranes, constitutes a considerably larger surface
where maternal and fetal zones remain in contact from mid-
gestation to delivery (Genba�
cev et al., 2015). Our findings sug-
gest that in the parietal decidua, ZIKV could disseminate from
uterine blood vessels to invasive CTBs to fetal membranes,

the amniotic membrane. Progeny virions released into amniotic
fluid could infect susceptible cells in fetal skin (Fujita et al.,
1991; Kubo et al., 2009), analogous to DENV infection of the
skin (Hamel et al., 2015; Wu et al., 2000). Recent reports support
both placental and paraplacental routes of ZIKV transmission,

 including (1) persistence of ZIKV in maternal blood during preg-
nancy, (2) high viral load in fetal membranes and viral RNA in am-
niotic fluid, (3) limited placental damage with high viral titers in
fetal brain, (4) more cases of symptomatic congenital ZIKV infec-
tions with microcephaly in early gestation as compared with late
gestation, and (5) a narrow window after primary infection until
fetal anomalies develop, suggesting direct infection of the fetus
(Brasil et al., 2016; Calvet et al., 2016; Driggers et al., 2016).
Regarding the first zone of contact between floating chorionic
villi in the maternal blood space and anchoring villi in the basal
decidua (Figure 7, left panel), it was recently reported that ZIKV
fails to infect syncytialized CTBs from late gestation due to
secretion of type III interferon (Bayer et al., 2016). Although
the cofactor TIM1 is strongly expressed in chorionic villi, we
observed that STBs are spared from infection, suggesting innate

immune responses protect the villus surface
(Savidis et al., 2016). Nonetheless, we identi-
fied ZIKV infection with both NS3 and E
expression in foci of proliferating CTBs near
the villus core and invasive CTBs expressing
HLA-G. In countries with endemic DENV
infection, it is likely that pre-existing maternal
antibodies cross-reactive with ZIKV but with
low neutralizing activity could promote infec-
tion of immune cells bearing Fcg receptors
(FcgRs) for IgG, as reported for DENV (Balsi-
tis et al., 2010; de Alwis et al., 2014). These
observations suggest a potential role for anti-
body-mediated
transcytosis
of
IgG-ZIKV
immune complexes by the neonatal Fc re-
ceptor expressed in STBs and infection
of underlying CTBs, as reported for HCMV
(Maidji et al., 2006). ZIKV dissemination in
the villus core could result in enhanced infec-
tion of FcgR-expressing Hofbauer cells, reported to be targets of
ZIKV infection in the placenta (Quicke et al., 2016). Here, we
found that fetal Hofbauer cells in the villus core of explants in-
fected with ZIKV expressed E glycoprotein and NS3 protein,
consistent with viral replication, suggesting that virion uptake
can result in infection of fetal macrophages. Infection of cells
bearing FcRs in basal and parietal decidua could potentially be
enhanced by immune complexes of ZIKV with weakly neutral-
izing DENV cross-reactive antibodies or antibodies that develop
after primary maternal ZIKV infection.
Our results have potential clinical relevance for congenital
ZIKV infection and implications regarding disease outcome.
We found that AmEpCs from mid-gestation placentas produce
higher virus titers than late-gestation cells, suggesting fetuses in-
fected earlier in gestation are exposed to more virus for a longer
162

 time during pregnancy. Infection in early and mid-gestation via
basal decidua and chorionic villi could disseminate virus to fetal
circulation at a critical stage in brain development, when high
viral load increases the risk of malformations. We observed
that ZIKV infected numerous clusters of proliferating CTBs in
intact villus explants, but ZIKV-infected cells stopped prolifer-
ating, and virus replicated in invasive CTBs. High viral titers
were released that could potentially spread infection to Hofbauer
cells, placental fibroblasts, and endothelial cells in the villus
core and fetal circulation. Moreover, the patterns of infection
observed suggest downstream structural defects: calcification
of the villus surface, truncation of developing cell columns that
then fail to attach to the uterine wall, and a reduced population
of invasive CTBs, which would impair remodeling of uterine
blood vessels, leading to IUGR, which is associated with
congenital ZIKV infection.
Regarding potential cofactors of ZIKV infection, immunoblot
and immunohistochemical analysis of isolated placental cells
and amniotic membranes, and biopsies of placental and fetal
membranes revealed that TIM1 was expressed consistently
and uniformly, regardless of individual donor and gestational
age, and was maintained during differentiation. In contrast, we
found that Axl and Tyro3 cofactors varied substantially across
donors, gestational age, and differentiation state. The consistent
and strong expression of TIM1 on fetal membranes in mid- and
late-gestation placentas and on numerous cell types at the uter-
ine-placental interface and early gestation chorionic villus ex-
plants, together with the susceptibility of proliferating and
invasive CTBs and Hofbauer cells to infection, suggests that
TIM1 may be an important cofactor for ZIKV infection. This
concept was supported by our results showing that duramy-
cin—a cyclic peptide inhibitor that exclusively binds PE in the
virion envelope, thus presumably precluding TIM1 binding of
PE in the virion envelope—inhibits ZIKV infection of TIM1-ex-
pressing cells at the uterine-placental interface. In addition, a
trophoblast cell line that does not express Axl is highly infected
by ZIKV (Bayer et al., 2016; Miner et al., 2016), suggesting that
Axl is not essential for infection. However, whether duramycin’s
effect on ZIKV infection is mediated solely by TIM1 remains to be
shown and is the subject of ongoing experiments. Duramycin
also blocks infection of dengue, Ebola, and West Nile viruses (Ri-
chard et al., 2015), reported to bind TIM1 as a cofactor for virion
entry (Kondratowicz et al., 2011; Moller-Tank et al., 2013), sug-
gesting utility of duramycin as a broad-spectrum antiviral that
could have clinical application for congenital ZIKV. Interestingly,
a TIM1 polymorphism is associated with susceptibility to severe
hepatitis A virus infection in certain populations (Kim et al., 2011),
but other forms predispose toward inflammation associated with
asthma and allergy (Gao et al., 2005). Whether genetic variants of
TIM1 expressed by pregnant women infected with ZIKV are
associated with severe congenital disease remains to be deter-
mined. Additionally, whether Axl, which we found varies in
expression by donor, gestational age, and tissue, plays a role
in ZIKV infection during pregnancy is unclear given the limited
Figure 7. A Model of Uterine-Placental Interface Indicating ZIKV Infection of Numerous Cell Types and Possible Routes of Transmission
(Left) Cross-section of the pregnant uterus and anchoring villus with CTBs that remodel blood vessels that channel maternal blood to the placenta surface. The
basic structural unit is the chorionic villus, composed of a stromal fibroblast core with fetal capillaries and Hofbauer cells/macrophages. During early devel-
opment, villus CTBs detach from the basement membrane and either fuse to form STBs, which cover floating villi, or proliferate and aggregate into a column of
extravillus CTBs that differentiate and invade the basal decidua and uterine wall (invasive CTBs). These anchoring villi establish physical connections between
mother and fetus through attachment of CTB cell columns. (Right) The amniochorionic membrane circumscribes the fetal compartment, extending from the
margins of the placenta to surround the fetus, with AmEpCs in direct contact with amniotic fluid. At 15–20 weeks gestation, as the amniotic sac enlarges, the
amniochorionic membranes fuse and contact the parietal decidua, and a subset of CTBs derived from TBPCs in the chorion invade the parietal decidua lining
the uterine wall (invasive CTBs). ZIKV infects primary placental cells that strongly express TIM1 (red). These include proliferating villus CTBs in proximal cell
columns; invasive CTBs, Hofbauer cells, HPFs, and HUVECs in chorionic villi; and TBPCs and AmEpCs in fetal membranes, defining a continuum of susceptible
cells that represent two routes of ZIKV transmission from the basal decidua to chorionic villi and fetal circulation (left), and parietal decidua to amniochorionic
membranes, amniotic fluid, and the fetus (right). Modified from Pereira et al. (2005).

 effect of an inhibitor (Holland et al., 2010) against infection in pri-
mary placental cells.
In summary, we have shown that ZIKV replicates in primary
human placental cells from mid- and late gestation and villus
explants from first-trimester human placentas, suggesting
placental and paraplacental routes of transmission, and that
infection of these cells is inhibited by the cyclic peptide duramy-
cin. Further, we suggest that these ex vivo model systems can be
used to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of ZIKV infection
and test antiviral drugs.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Human Tissue Samples
This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of
California, San Francisco (UCSF). Tissue was collected from term deliveries
and elective terminations at UCSF Medical Center. For tissue analysis,
placenta membrane biopsies from 30 donors were fixed in 4% paraformalde-
hyde (PFA) and frozen in optimal cutting temperature compound (OCT; Tissue
Tek), as described previously (Tabata et al., 2012), or fixed in 10% formalin,
embedded in paraffin, and sectioned for immunohistochemistry and histology
(McDonagh et al., 2006; Pereira et al., 2014).
Primary Human Cells, Cell Lines, and Cell Culture
AmEpCs were isolated from early (16.5–23.6 weeks; n = 10) and late (38.6–
41.0 weeks; n = 6) gestational-age fetal membranes and cultured according
to published methods (Miki et al., 2005) with minor modifications. AmEpCs
were cultured on fibronectin (Sigma-Aldrich) in DMEM/F12 (GIBCO) with
20 ng/mL epidermal growth factor (EGF; R&D Systems), 10% fetal bovine
serum (FBS; Invitrogen), nonessential amino acids, 55 mM 2-mercaptoethanol,
and Antibiotic-Antimycotic (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Only P1 cells 100% im-
munopositive for cytokeratin 19 were used. TBPCs from human chorion (7.3
and 15.6 weeks), provided by Susan Fisher (UCSF), were cultured on gelatin
in DMEM/F12 (1:1) with 10 ng/mL basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF; R&D
Systems), 10 mM SB431542 (Tocris Bioscience), and 10% FBS (Genbacev
et al., 2011). TBPCs 100% immunopositive for cytokeratin (MAb 7D3) (Damsky
et al., 1992) and GATA4 were used up to P15. CTBs were isolated from
second-trimester (15.6–21.1 weeks; n = 7) and third-trimester placentas
(37.2 weeks; n = 1), as previously described (Fisher et al., 2000; Tabata
et al., 2007), and cultured on Matrigel (BD Biosciences) in serum-free medium:
DMEM/F12 (1:1) with 2% Nutridoma (Roche Diagnostics), 1% sodium pyru-
vate, 1% HEPES, penicillin/streptomycin (P/S), and gentamycin (UCSF Cell
Culture Facility) (Fisher et al., 2000). Human placental fibroblasts (HPFs;
8 weeks) were grown in DMEM/M199 (4:1) with amino acids and 10% FBS.
Trophoblast cell lines JEG-3 and HTR8, a gift from Michael S. Diamond (Wash-
ington University in St. Louis), were grown in DMEM/F12 and RPMI 1640 with
10% FBS. HUVECs were grown in EBM-2 with EGM-2 SingleQuots (Lonza).
Cells 98% immunopositive for von Willebrand factor (Novocastra Labora-
tories), P4–P6, were used. Human adult retinal pigment epithelial cells
(ARPE-19) (Dunn et al., 1996) were grown in DMEM (GIBCO) with 10% FBS.
BHK-21 clone 15 cells (gift from S. Kliks) were grown in MEM with 5% FBS,
nonessential amino acids, 2 mM L-glutamine, and P/S (GIBCO). Aedes
albopictus C6/36 cells (gift from Ralph Baric, University of North Carolina,
Chapel Hill) were grown in MEM-a with 2% FBS and 1% P/S (GIBCO) at
32�C with 5% CO2.

gated in C6/36 cells. Cell-free supernatants were harvested 3 dpi, aliquotted,
and stored at �80�C. Nica1-16 and Nica 2-16 were isolated from ZIKV-in-
fected patients by the National Virology Laboratory, Ministry of Health, Man-
agua, Nicaragua, using C6/36 cells. Full-length sequencing by MiSeq
confirmed them to be closely related to Brazilian 2015–2016 strains (GenBank:
KX421195 and KX421194). Cells were infected with MR766 at MOI 0.001–3
and maintained up to 10 days. AmEpCs (21.2, 22.6, 38.6, and 40.2 weeks)
were infected with Nica1-16 or Nica2-16 at MOI 0.001–0.009. CTBs were in-
fected with MR766 (MOI 1–2) 16 hr after isolation and plating on Matrigel
and maintained for 3 days (Yamamoto-Tabata et al., 2004).
Placental Villus Explants
Normal human placentas (7.5–8.4 weeks; n = 4) were obtained from elective
termination of pregnancy (Advanced Bioscience Resources). Chorionicvillusex-
plants were isolated and cultured as anchoring villi as described previously (Ta-
bata et al., 2012). Explants were cultured on Millicell-CM inserts (0.4 mm pore
size, Millipore) coated with Matrigel in DMEM/F12 (1:1) with 10% FBS, P/S,
and amino acids. Two or 24 hr after attachment to Matrigel, explants were in-
fectedwithZIKVMR766(13106PFU/explant)orNica1-16(53103PFU/explant)
and maintained for 2–3 days before fixation and embedding (Tabata et al., 2012).
ZIKV Titration
Infectious virions were titered by plaque assay (PA), as described previously
(Diamond et al., 2000) with minor modifications, or FFA on BHK-21 cells.
Focus-forming units (FFUs) were stained with anti-envelope (E) MAb 4G2
(Henchal et al., 1982), anti-mouse IgG-HRP (Jackson Laboratories) secondary
antibody, and TrueBlue (KPL) substrate. Titers were also determined by rapid
immunofluorescence-based infectivity assay in human ARPE-19 cells, as
previously described for HCMV (Zydek et al., 2014), using anti-E antibody.
Antibodies and Reagents
MAb 4G2 was obtained from ATCC, and anti-DENV non-structural protein 3
(NS3) MAb E1D8 was generated by the E.H. laboratory (Balsitis et al., 2009).
See the Supplemental Information for additional details.
Immunofluorescence Staining
See the Supplemental Information for details.
Immunohistochemical Staining
Sections from 30 donors were stained with hematoxylin and eosin or immuno-
stained (Pereira et al., 2014). Antigen retrieval was performed for all antibodies
using 10 mM sodium citrate (pH 6.0) under high pressure and heat.
Immunoblotting
See the Supplemental Information for details.
Inhibitor Studies
For Axl kinase inhibition, confluent AmEpCs grown in 24-well plates were incu-
bated with R428 (0.03–3.0 mM; ApexBio) for 1 hr at 37�C, 5% CO2, then
replaced with 250 mL of R428-containing medium with virus (MR766 or
Nica2-16 at MOI 0.014). After 2 hr at 37�C, 250 mL medium was added to
each well, and plates were incubated overnight. Medium was then replaced,
and cells were incubated 1–2 days and fixed (4% PFA) for immunostaining
with anti-NS3 antibody. Total and NS3-positive cells were counted, and the
percentage of cells infected was determined. For duramycin inhibition, virus
was incubated in 250 mL medium containing duramycin (0.04–1.0 mM;
Sigma-Aldrich) for 1 hr, and was then added to confluent cells. After 2 hr
at 37�C, 5% CO2, 250 mL medium was added to each well, and cells were
incubated, fixed, and analyzed as above.
