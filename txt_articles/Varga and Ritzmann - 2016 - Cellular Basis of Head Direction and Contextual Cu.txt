SUMMARY
Animals rely upon integrated sensory information for
spatial navigation. A question of wide importance in
navigation is how sensory cues get transformed into
neural codes that represent the animal’s orientation
within its proximal environment. Here, we investi-
gated the possibility of head-direction coding in the
central complex of the cockroach, Blaberus discoida-
lis. We used extracellular recordings in restrained
animals that were rotated on a platform relative to a
fixed landmark. The passive rotations allowed us to
test for head-direction coding in the absence of self-
generated motion cues. Our results indicate that
individual cells in the central complex encode the an-
imal’s heading relative to a landmark’s position in
several ways. In some cells, directional tuning was es-
tablished even in the absence of visual cues, suggest-
ing that the directional code can be maintained solely
based on the internal motion cues derived from the
passive rotations. Additionally, some cells in the cen-
tral complex encoded rotation-direction history, a
navigational context cue, by increasing or decreasing
the firing rate during the stationary periods following
clockwise or counterclockwise rotations. Together,
these results unveil head-direction cell-like activity
in the insect central complex, which highly resemble
similarly functioning cells in the mammalian brain
that encode head direction. We predict that the
observed head-orientation coding and directionally
sensitive cells are essential components of the brain
circuitry mediating insect navigation.
INTRODUCTION
Successful navigation is fundamental for animal survival. The
most basic aspect of navigation is establishing one’s spatial
orientation in the environment. In all mammals studied to date,
spatial orientation coincides with the continuous updating of
the animal’s azimuthal head-angle among so-called ‘‘head-di-
rection cells.’’ This process is based upon the animal’s directional
heading within its environment, independent of location [1–4].
While insects are known to perform remarkable navigational
tasks, it is unknown whether individual head-direction cells with
properties similar to those observed in mammals exist in insects.
In mammals, head-direction cells rely upon a variety of sen-
sory inputs to update the highly dynamic directional signal
animals receive during navigation. Each head-direction cell en-
codes a single preferred head orientation, which can be estab-
lished in reference to environmental sensory cues (viz., allothetic
cues, including visual, and olfactory information) that serve the
role of a spatial landmark [2]. Alternatively, the preferred angle
can be established based on continuous updates derived from
internal sensory cues that integrate self-movement information
(idiothetic cues), such as vestibular flow, optic flow, propriocep-
tive feedback, and motor efference copy [4–6]. Head-direction
cells primarily rely upon allothetic cues to encode orientation,
although, in the absence of landmarks, idiothetic cues can up-
date the head-direction signal [4, 6]. A properly updated direc-
tional signal without information about the navigational context,
however, is not behaviorally meaningful [7–9]. The navigation
system needs to be informed about contextual cues, such as a
navigational goal, a phase of a behavioral task, or the relative di-
rection of the movements (left versus right) that lead to a new
head direction, but are not directly encoded in the head-direction
signal. Such contextual information may also contribute to
spatial memory, and thus to adaptive navigation, by providing
the animal with a cellular-based reference of past orientation,
whereby to compare ongoing and/or possibly future headings
[7, 8, 10]. Whether cells in the insect brain function in this manner
to encode spatial information is currently unknown.
The central complex (CX) of the insect brain represents direc-
tional components of sensory information processing and navi-
gation in a variety of species [11] including locusts [12, 13],
crickets [14], monarch butterflies [15, 16], dung beetles [17], fruit
flies [18], and cockroaches [19, 20]. Neurons in the CX represent
celestial information in some insects and adjust the animal’s
heading toward a defined goal [12, 13, 15, 17, 21, 22]. Our under-
standing of the CX’s role in head-direction coding, however, is
still far from complete [18, 21, 23]. Recently, Seelig and Jayara-
man monitored the activity of a population of neurons in one neu-
ropil of the CX, the ellipsoid body (EB), with Ca2+ imaging and
found that this population represented the tethered fly’s orienta-
tion similarly to mammalian head-direction cells [18]. This is a
highly significant advance for the field of insect navigation. Major
questions still remain, however, regarding the function of the CX
in orientation. Particularly, because the imaging method utilized
by Seelig and Jayaraman focused upon quantification of popula-
tion dynamics, rather than analysis of the activity of individual
neurons, it is difficult to draw direct comparisons between their
data and the single cells in the mammalian brain known to partic-
ipate in head-direction coding. Thus, we do not know the sen-
sory mechanisms whereby individual neurons in the CX encode

 head direction. Moreover, do these cells have the capacity to
encode other types of spatial information, such as navigational
context cues? These are significant questions that, if answered,
will complement the population code data [18], thereby, extend-
ing models of insect navigation strategies.
We considered the cockroach to be an ideal model to under-
stand the fundamental coding schemes underlying navigation.
First, cockroaches, versus Drosophila, are nocturnal insects
which, similarly to rats, forage and live in dark, maze-like environ-
ments [24]. Second, cockroaches, versus mammals, must
accomplish feats of navigation with a limited CNS, void of the
executive and affective influences known to modulate mamma-
lian behaviors. These features, combined with the tractability
of physiological approaches, make the cockroach a strong
contender to unlock mysteries of navigation. Therefore, here
we adopted the methods and controls of well-established
head-direction cell studies in rodents [1, 2, 25], to allow us to
draw comparisons between the observed response characteris-
tics of CX units and those elegantly described in mammalian
navigation. We utilized extracellular recordings in the cockroach,
Blaberus discoidalis, to test the overall hypothesis that single
neurons in the CX encode head direction. We found that individ-
ual neurons in the CX of the cockroach encode head direction, as
well as information regarding the navigational context, similar to
those reported extensively in mammals [4, 26–30] including hu-
mans [31–34], and thereby provide a compelling example of a
highly conserved or convergent navigational system. We pro-
pose that further work in the cockroach model will yield addi-
tional fundamental computations used by nervous systems to
resolve navigation in more complex models (i.e., rodents to
humans).
RESULTS
Central Complex Neurons Encode Head Direction
We recorded from the CX of head-fixed cockroaches that were
rotated in a circular direction (Figure 1A). Each cockroach expe-
rienced 360� rotations, in 30� increments, four to six times in both
clockwise (CW) and counterclockwise (CCW) directions. So that
the role of a visual landmark in head-direction coding could
be tested, our recording arena consisted of a uniform black envi-
ronment containing a large (60� angular extent), solid white
landmark which was removable. Our recording paradigm was
designed to afford the analysis of CX responses when the animal
was immobile, following each 30� rotation step (Figure 1B). It is
important to emphasize that, even when discussing the effects
of rotation-direction history, we restricted all of our analyses to
epochs wherein the animal is stationary. Further, our paradigm
allowed us to selectively test for head-direction coding in the
context of passive rotations, wherein internal motion cues are
the only idiothetic input that can be used by the animal to update
a potential navigational system, allowing us to further narrow
down the sources of sensory inputs that contribute to the direc-
tional signal (Figure S1).
We recorded a total of 173 single units from two CX neuro-
pils, the ellipsoid body (EB; 99/173 units) and the fan-shaped
body (FB; 74/173 units) from 27 cockroaches (EB:15; FB:12;
see recording sites in Figure S2). As illustrated in Figure 2A,
we established that some units displayed altered firing rates
depending upon the animal’s head angle. The single unit
shown in Figure 2A, for instance, displayed fairly regular firing
rates while facing one angle (Figure 2A1, ‘‘non-preferred
angle’’) which then increased in frequency while the animal
was facing a different angle (Figure 2A2, ‘‘preferred angle’’).
Indeed, across the entire recording, which included five rota-
tions, this unit repeatedly displayed consistent phasic in-
creases and decreases in its firing rate (Figure 2A3). This unit’s
firing rate, averaged across all rotation angles, displayed a sta-
tistically significant mean vector position (i.e., peak) at �160�,
which we will term the unit’s preferred angle (p < 0.001 Ray-
leigh test). Looking across the entire population of CX units
(n = 173), across all conditions, 37.5% (65/173; 19 animals)
of CX units were significantly modulated by head direction dur-
ing at least one condition (p < 0.05 Rayleigh test; three to
seven trials/unit; see also Figures S4A and S4E). Among all
units that significantly encoded an angle during the control

 trials (those with the landmark in the original location), the entire
360� environment was represented uniformly (p = 0.11; Ray-
leigh test of unimodal units’ peaks; Figure S3). Thus, similarly
to reports of rat head-direction cells [4], these units possess
the capacity to represent any angle relative to the animal, just
like a compass.

 Tuning Characteristics of Head-Direction Encoding
Neurons
Head-direction cells in rats are narrowly tuned to a preferred
angle and as the head turns away from this angle, the firing rate
drops near zero [1, 4]. Thus, we asked whether directionally sen-
sitive CX cells are narrowly or broadly tuned to their preferred an-
gles. To test this, we categorized the 65 angle-modulated units
based upon their mean resultant vector lengths (R value). The
R value defines the circular spread, or tuning curve, of a given
unit [35] and it is strongly negatively correlated with the half width
of a tuning curve (r (df CW = 29) = –0.81; p < 0.001; r (df CCW = 33) =
–0.89; p < 0.001). Therefore, we defined units as being narrowly
tuned if their R values were closer to 1—the majority of the spikes
occurred closely around the preferred angle—and cells as being
broadly tuned if their R values were closer to 0—spiking activity
was less localized around the preferred angle.
We found that CX units encoded head direction with a range of
narrowto broad coding schemes (see examples in Figures 2B and
2C).ToquantifytuningacrosstheentirepopulationofCXneurons,
using the R values, we sorted all angle-modulated units into quar-
tiles (1: 0 < R % 0.25; 2: 0.25 < R % 0.5; 3: 0.5 < R % 0.75; 4: 0.75 <
R % 1). We also normalized the individual tuning curves to the
peak firing rate and aligned them with respect to this peak (Fig-
ure 3A) in order to represent the individual unit differences within
the quartiles. Figures 3A and 3B show that the majority of head-
direction coding units are broadly tuned to their preferred angles,
with 83% of units falling into quartiles 1 and 2. The remainder of
the modulated CX units are narrowly tuned, and more precisely
encode angle. Next, we investigated the relationship between
the tuning schemes and ‘‘background’’ firing rates of angle-
modulated units. For both rotation directions, the R values
and minimum firing rate showed a strong negative correlation
Figure 3. Tuning Characteristics of Angle-Modulated CX Units
(A) Two-dimensional histogram illustrating the normalized firing rates of angle-modulated single units for every 30� bin. The normalized tuning curves were aligned
at the peak. We utilized R values to indicate the spread or tuning of a cell. An R of 0–0.5 indicates that the cell is broadly tuned, whereas an R of 0.5–1 means the
cell is narrowly tuned to an angle. Based on this criteria the normalized tuning curves were organized into four quartiles (Q1-Q4). The average normalized tuning
curves ±SD are depicted in line graphs to the right.

angle tuning characteristics (p = 0.822; paired two-tailed t test).

 (r (df CW = 29) = �0.59; p < 0.001 and r (df CCW = 33) = �0.54;
p < 0.001, Pearson’s correlation). Thus, narrowly tuned units
have lower background firing rates, while broadly tuned units
have higher background firing rates. We also found a strong nega-
tive correlation between signal:noise (minimum firing rate divided
by maximum firing rate) and the R value of angle-modulated units
(r (df CW = 29) = �0.86; p < 0.001 and r (df CCW = 33) = �0.85;
p < 0.001, Pearson’s correlation) suggesting that the width of
the tuning curve increases as the signal:noise decreases.
Does the location of the recording within the cockroach CX (EB
versus FB) affect the unit’s tuning characteristics? During control
CW and CCW trials, 37.4% (37/99; 11 animals) of units recorded
in the EB significantly encoded an angle (unimodal units) and 5%
(five out of 99; four animals) encoded two angles (bimodal units).
Only 10.8% of FB units (eight out of 74 units; five animals) were
unimodal and 4% (three out of 74 units; three animals) were
bimodal. Thus, the EB contained significantly more angle-modu-
lated units than the FB (c2 (1) = 7.471; p = 0.006, two tailed with
Yates correction). When categorizing the R values of unimodal
EB units, we found that the majority of them were broadly tuned
(CW: 83%; CCW: 77% in quartiles 1 and 2), and the remaining
portion of them were narrowly tuned (CW: 17% in quartiles 3
and 4; CCW: 23% in quartile 3). All categorized FB units were un-
imodal and broadly tuned (CW:100% in category 1; CCW: 60% in
category 1 and 40% in category 2). These results suggest that a
subpopulation within the EB may participate more in narrowly
tuned head-direction coding than the FB (c2 (1) = 0.575;
p = 0.448, two tailed with Yates correction). Importantly, broadly
and narrowly tuned units were found within the same recordings
in the EB on several occasions (largest range of R values in one
site: 0.05 to 0.93), suggesting a lack of anatomical segregation
forthedifferent coding schemes at leastwithintheEB. Altogether,
the above analyses are consistent with the hypothesis that a sub-
set of individual neurons in two subunits of the CX encode head
direction and do so along a variety of coding schemes.
We next asked whether the rotation direction in which the an-
imals were moved influenced the encoding of head direction in
CX neurons. We compared tuning curves across all angle-modu-
lated units in the control CW and CCW conditions. The tuning
curves of the entire ensemble of angle-modulated units were sta-
tistically similar (p = 0.822; paired two-tailed t test on R values).
We found that only 40% of these units encoded an angle during
both CW and CCW control conditions with an average of 39.9� ±
44.9� difference in peak positions (ranging from 2.7� to 197.2�);
thus, we categorized the data separately based on rotation di-
rection. All categorized R values were divided into two groups
for significant angle response following CW (n = 31 units; Figures
3C1 and 3C2) and CCW (n = 35 units; Figures 3D1 and 3D2) con-
trol rotations. Using these criteria, we found that the majority of
units across the two groups were broadly tuned (CW: 85%;
CCW: 80%), and the remaining portion of them were narrowly
tuned (CW:15%; CCW: 20%). These data show that rotation-di-
rection history affects the position of the encoded angles but
does not affect the breadth of tuning.
Head-Direction Encoding CX Neurons Rely upon
Allothetic and/or Idiothetic Cues
Directional responses in rodents may encode the inner represen-
tation of, and tuning to, allothetic cues, or they could be a prod-
uct of self-motion (idiothetic) cues [4, 9]. To test whether CX cells
are tuned to the artificial landmark in the animal’s proximal envi-
ronment (allothetic cue), we rotated the landmark’s position by
180� or 90� following control trials (in 15 and six animals, respec-
tively). 38.3% of the 128 units recorded (a subset of those pre-
sented above in Figures 2 and 3) were angle-modulated during
at least one of the above mentioned trials (49 units/16 animals;
69% EB and 31% FB units; Figures S4B and S4E). We analyzed
landmark positional effects separately for CW and CCW trials, to
avoid confounds that may arise from also incorporating rotation
direction. We calculated the mean vector position (i.e., peak) for
each unit during control and landmark-rotated (LR) trials. Then,
we compared the peaks across LR trials to the expected peaks
(control peak + the amount of shift in landmark position [180� or
90�]). To account for the possibility that binning the data might
have led to slightly shifted peaks, and taking into consideration
that even rat head-direction cells have an average error of
�20� (ranging up to 48� [2]), we set a maximum of 60�of accept-
able error when comparing any peak positions.
We found five categories of effects among the 49 angle-modu-
lated units (see Table 1 for details). In 20.4% of CX neurons (ten
out of 49 units; eight animals) the shift in landmark position coin-
cided with a near-equal shift of the cells’ peaks (example, Fig-
ure 4A; Table 1, 1. Allothetic). These data support the hypothesis
that the CX participates in allocentric navigational processes,
wherein a unit’s directional tuning is determined by external
reference points in the environment.
The second category of angle-modulated units (14 units;
28.6%; seven animals) had persisting peak positions that were
locked to the initial landmark position even after it had been
shifted (example, Figure 4B; details in Table 1, 2. Idiothetic).
These units were either modulated by an unknown, but stable,
landmark, or they used idiothetic cues to maintain their direc-
tional tuning. Alternatively, these units might have relied upon
short-term memory processes to encode the original preferred
angle established in reference with the control landmark position
throughout the entire experiment regardless of subsequent
changes in landmark position.
The third category of units (12 units; 24.5%; seven animals)
were bimodal and encoded two preferred angles (Figure 4C;
detailed results in Table 1, 3. Two peaks, 180�). A subpopulation
of these units (five out of 12 units; two animals) significantly en-
coded one angle during the control trials and developed the
additional second peak during the LR trials. In all of these cases,
one peak encoded the original single preferred angle, and the
second peak followed the landmark shift and encoded the ex-
pected preferred angle. Four out of 12 units (three animals) had
two peaks during the control trials and only one peak during
the LR trials. Except for one unit, all of these examples (three
out of four) encoded one of the original peaks during the LR trials,
which suggests that this consistent peak was established using
idiothetic cues.
The remaining three out of 12 units from the third category
experienced a 90� rotation in landmark position (two animals;
data in Table 1, 3. Two peaks, 90�). All three of these units
were bimodal during the control trials, and one out of three units
responded to the rotated landmark with a single peak, which per-
sisted to encode one of the original peaks. The other two out of
three units (from the same animal) persisted to display two peaks

 during the rotated trials as well. In both cases, the two peaks
from the control CW trials remained approximately in their orig-
inal positions during CW LR trials but shifted following the
landmark shift during CCW LR trials compared to the control
CCW trials.
The fourth category of angle-modulated units (ten out of 49;
seven animals) were ‘‘mixed’’ in their responses (Table 1, 4.
Mixed). These units were unimodal but displayed different
response patterns following CW and CCW rotations. Specif-
ically, the peaks were locked to the control landmark position
after one rotation direction and shifted with the landmark when
it was rotated around the other way. These examples support
the hypothesis that CX neurons not only encode head direction,
but also may respond to contextual changes, such as rotation-
direction history, by selecting a different spatial coding strategy
(allothetic versus idiothetic).
The remaining category of three out of 49 angle-modulated
units unpredictably shifted their peaks, which could indicate a
general remapping in the directional code due to the landmark
positional changes (three animals; data in Table 1, 5. Random
shift).
Taken together, these categories of CX units reflect that head-
direction coding by CX units may occur by means of encoding

Head-Direction Coding Persists
Even in the Absence of Visual
Landmarks
The preceding analyses suggest that
visual cues are sufficient to subserve
head-direction coding in CX neurons. To
test whether visual cues are necessary for head-direction cod-
ing, we removed the landmark from the recording arena. In these
experiments, which followed a subset of the previous experi-
ments (81 units, 13 animals), we first rotated the animals around
with the landmark present, then shifted the landmark position
(LR trials, same data as in Figure 4 and Table 1), and last
removed the landmark from the arena (‘‘no landmark’’ trials;
see Figures S4C and S4E). 27.1% of the recorded units (nine an-
imals; 22/81 units) established a directional tuning during the
control trials of the experiment. A subpopulation of angle-modu-
lated units continued to encode head direction even in the
absence of the landmark (36.4%, eight out of 22 units; six ani-
mals; Figure 5A).
Units that encoded the same head direction during both con-
trol and LR trials (five out of eight; 62.5%) persisted to encode the
same angle during the no landmark trials (average error during
CW trials: 23.7� ± 19.1�; during CCW trials: 18.2� ± 21.9�; control
versus no landmark peaks: p = 0.757; paired two-tailed t test).
These data strongly support the hypothesis that idiothetic cues
are sufficient to inform head-direction coding in the CX. While
one unit (one out of eight; 12.5%) unpredictably shifted its
peak, the remaining units in this subpopulation (two out of eight;
25%) encoded the same angle during LR trials and no landmark

 trials (average error during CW trials: 18.6� ± 7.8�; during CCW
trials: 33.0� ± 5.8�; LR versus no landmark peaks; p = 0.944;
paired two-tailed t test).
These examples support the hypothesis that some units might
rely upon short-term memory or idiothetic cues to update the
directional signal when no visual landmarks are available.
We confirmed this finding by recording from a cohort of six
additional animals (45 units), none of which had experience
with the recording arena or the visual landmark. These ‘‘land-
mark-naive’’ animals were placed in the arena with no landmark,
and then we completely covered their heads with aluminum foil
to block all possible visual cues. The head-covered animals
were then rotated in CW and CCW directions with absolutely
no stationary visual information available to them. Following
these trials, the foil was removed and the animals were rotated
around CW and CCW, experiencing the control conditions with
a single visual landmark. Strikingly, even in the absence of visual
cues, only relying upon the motion cues derived from the rota-
tions, some units significantly encoded head direction (eight
out of 45; 17.8%; Figure 5B; Figures S4D and S4E). During the
second, control part of the experiment, nine additional CX units
(17/45; 37.8%) established a significant angle response. We
analyzed all of the units that were angle-modulated during the
head-covered and/or following control trials. Most units (14/17
units for CW (c2 (1) = 3.712; p = 0.054) and 11/17 units for
CCW (c2 (1) = 0.485; p = 0.4761) both two tailed with Yates
correction) unpredictably shifted the peak position after the foil
was removed suggesting a general remapping in the directional
signal caused by the newly available visual cues (CW average
shift: 118.9� ± 41.3�; CCW average shift: 130.3� ± 38.5�; head-
covered versus control condition peaks; p = 0.152; paired two-
tailed t test). Meanwhile, other units (two out of 17 for CW and
five out of 17 for CCW) did not significantly change their peak po-
sitions after the landmark became visible (CW average shift:
34.76� ± 33.2�; CCW average shift: 25.2� ± 17.5�; head-covered
versus control condition peaks; p = 0.860; paired two-tailed
t test). These findings not only support the hypothesis that inter-
nally available references derived from passive movement are
sufficient for encoding head orientations, but further confirm
that some units rely solely upon idiothetic cues even when visual
cues become available.
Central Complex Units Encode Rotation-Direction
History
Some neurons in the hippocampal formation of mammals are
influenced by, and encode navigational context cues, such as
the history of rotation direction [32]. When only considering the
control CW and CCW conditions, we found that 68.8% (119/
173) of CX units did not encode head direction. We tested
whether
these
units
encode
rotation-direction
history
by
comparing their firing rates during the stationary periods
following CW versus CCW rotations. Despite the fact that on
the population level rotation-direction history did not affect
the firing rate (p = 0.863; paired two-tailed t test on mean
spike number per unit during all CW versus CCW trials), we
found that 69.7% (83/119; 25 animals) of individual units dis-
played significantly greater firing rates at each angle during
the stationary periods after the animal was rotated in a partic-
ular direction (p < 0.05; paired two-tailed t tests per unit
comparing mean spike number across every angle bin for all
CW versus CCW trials; Figures 6A, 6B, 6D, and 6E). 29/83 units
(35%; 14 animals) encoded the direction it was first exposed to
with a higher firing rate, while significantly more units (54/83;
65%; 19 animals) had increased firing rates in response to
the new rotational direction (c2 (1) = 4.481; p = 0.034; two tailed
with Yates correction). These results show that a subpopulation
of units in the CX may play a different role in navigation by stor-
ing information about navigational context, such as directional
history.
Upon finding that some neurons encode directional history,
we considered that an optimal navigational strategy would be
for some neurons to represent two discrete features of spatial in-
formation (head direction and the memory of rotational direc-
tion), in a manner sometimes termed ‘‘multiplexing’’. We tested
this possibility across all units showing angle modulation during
the control trials (54/173 units; 31.2%). In these units, we tested
whether the firing rates during exclusively immobile periods de-
pended upon the recent rotation direction. Although, we found
that on the population level rotational history did not affect the
average firing rate of angle-modulated units (p = 0.419; paired
two-tailed t test on mean spike number per unit during all CW
versus CCW trials), a subpopulation of these units (37/54 units;
67.3%; 19 animals) did encode rotational history as well, by
significantly changing spiking activity (p < 0.05; paired two-tailed
t tests per unit comparing mean spike number across every
angle bin for all CW versus CCW trials; Figures 6C–6E). A smaller
portion of these multiplexing units (43.2%, 16/37; nine animals)
responded to being rotated in the original direction with a higher
firing rate, while 56.8% of units (21/37; ten animals) responded
with an increase when the platform was being turned in a new di-
rection (c2 (1) = 0.221; p = 0.638; two tailed with Yates correc-
tion). Together, these results show that some individual neurons
in the CX multiplex two major types of orientation information,
head direction and rotational history, in a manner possibly
serving adaptive navigation.
DISCUSSION
The neural basis of navigation is a fundamental problem to solve
in order to understand the mechanisms underlying critical animal
behaviors. Here, we report that individual cells in the CX of the
cockroach encode head direction, as well as the history of rota-
tion direction in manners strikingly similar to those reported in
rodents [1, 29, 36], bats [26, 27], non-human primates [30], and
humans [37–39] and do so through modulation of the firing rates
of individual cells. We predict these angle-coding neurons are
essential components of the brain circuitry mediating insect
navigation.
It was recently discovered that population codes within the
Drosophila EB reflect head orientation during walking [18].
Here, we add to this growing body of literature on CX naviga-
tional coding schemes by exploring sensory orientation of
individual neurons within the populations that make up the cock-
roach CX. Since it was established in the paper by Seelig and
Jayaraman, that the monitored population’s response was
similar in complex and single-landmark environments [18],
we tested the question of head-direction coding by utilizing
one landmark. While unlikely, it is possible that some of the
1824
Current Biology 26, 1816–1828, July 25, 2016
 responses observed during the control and LR trials are due to
the units’ tuning to the landmark’s visual features rather than
its position. However, units that followed the idiothetic, bimodal,
and mixed responses argue against this possibility (Figure 4;
Table 1). Additionally, because of our relatively narrow landmark,
most of the peaks in these experiments did not line up with any
features of the landmark. Rather, the peaks represented a head-
ing relative to the reference (which in many cases also happened
to be outside of the animal’s visual field). Together, our landmark
removal and blindfolded experiments demonstrate that CX neu-
rons encode head direction.
A major goal of the present study was to determine whether
CX neurons rely on the same hierarchy of sensory information
as angle-coding cells reported in mammals [4, 6, 26]. For
instance, in rats, head-direction cells primarily rely upon allo-
thetic cues but can update the directional signal based on idiot-
hetic cues if needed [4]. What idiothetic cues do animals need to
establish head direction? Some answers to this question in ro-
dents come from studies comparing angle coding in freely

walking animals to that of passively trans-
ported ones. Freely walking animals have
access to all idiothetic cues, including
proprioception and motor feedback, as
well as motion cues (vestibular cues in
mammals). In contrast, passively trans-
ported animals only have access to mo-
tion cues. Several rodent studies have
confirmed
that
passive
displacement
does not abolish head-direction cell ac-
tivity, indicating that motion cues derived
from vestibular inputs alone can maintain
the signal [25, 40]. Thus, the utilization of
sensory cues by head-direction cells in
rodents is highly adaptive to ensure optimum navigation even
in dynamic sensory contexts.
Our results support the hypothesis that head-direction coding
in the cockroach relies upon similar sensory pools as in rats
[2, 4, 37, 40]. Specifically, we found that neurons in the CX
encode head direction through three main strategies (allothetic
[Figure 4A]; allothetic and idiothetic [Figure 4C]; idiothetic [Fig-
ure 4B]). CX neurons following the idiothetic strategy continued
to rigidly encode the originally established preferred angle
even after the landmark was repositioned, possibly indicating
that this angle may have been derived from internal cues. Alter-
natively, it is possible that idiothetic cues can override head-di-
rection cell responses when the shift in the landmark’s position
is close to 180�, as reported by Knierim et al. [37]. Thus, these
neurons might have originally encoded an angle based on an
allothetic cue, and, when that cue became unreliable (shifted),
they switched to idiothetic cues to update the same angle.
In support of the hypothesis that idiothetic cues alone may be
sufficient to update the head-direction signal, we also found that
Current Biology 26, 1816–1828, July 25, 2016
1825
 CX neurons persisted to encode head direction following land-
mark removal (Figure 5A) and even in ‘‘blind-folded’’ animals
(Figure 5B). These results not only indicate that orientation cod-
ing can be based on idiothetic cues, but also, because of our
passive-rotation experimental design, they additionally support
the hypothesis that, similarly to rodents [25, 40], motion cues
alone can update the head-direction system. Importantly, such
motion cues have to integrate continuous information about
speed and position in order to continuously update the dynamic
head-direction signal. Previous work from our lab described
neurons in the CX that encode the angular velocity of tethered
animals, which have the potential to update the described
head-direction system about changes in speed [19]. The angular
velocity signal might travel through neural pathways reminiscent
of the vestibular pathways in the brains of mammals, which
originate from the Johnston’s organs in the insect antennae
[38, 39, 41]. These pathways might be responsible for providing
the insect navigational circuit with continuous motion cues.
Future studies are needed to define the brain region(s) needed
to encode the position of the animal. The finding of directionally
tuned cells in insects provides an essential starting point to these
future directions, given the reliance of many spatial coding
schemes upon head-direction cells in rodents [42].
In addition to directional and positional information, success-
ful navigation requires updates and memories upon context-
dependent
information.
Contextual
information,
such
as
navigational goal, or movement direction are encoded in naviga-
tion centers of rodent and human brains [8, 31, 32, 34, 43]. For
instance, McNaughton et al. [43] showed that ‘‘complex-spike
cells’’ in the hippocampus consistently increased their firing
rates when the animal was moving in a particular direction within
a maze. Jacobs and colleagues [32] described ‘‘path cells’’ in the
human entorhinal cortex, which varied their firing rate depending
on whether the patients were driving in a CW or CCW direction in
a virtual-navigation game. Here, we found that a subpopulation
of CX neurons encoded past rotation-direction information
during stationary periods (Figures 6A, 6B, 6D, and 6E). The direc-
tional effect on firing rate was consistent during the long station-
ary periods (data not shown), indicating that the increase in firing
rate is not caused by movement-related rebound effects [44].
Further, we resolved that some CX neurons integrate or multiplex
both the current head direction and past rotation direction
through changes in firing rate (Figures 6C–6E). Additionally, we
found examples of rotation direction impacting the applied
head-direction coding strategy within a single cell. This finding
is highly novel and, to our knowledge, is the first example of
context-dependent spatial information coding in an insect
neuron. We predict that these cells may underlie complex behav-
iors by providing context-dependent information for action
selection [45] and place learning [45–47], which contribute to
adaptive navigation [8].
In comparison to what is known in rodents, little is known
regarding the cellular features of adaptive navigation in insects
[27]. Heinze and Homberg showed that the CX in locusts con-
tains a sun compass that can encode the animal’s head direction
relative to celestial cues [21]. The neural signal containing direc-
tional skylight information is altered as it travels through several
stages of processing from the input areas to the output areas of
the CX. Specifically, early-stage neurons are more narrowly
tuned with lower background firing rates, while later-stage neu-
rons are broadly tuned displaying higher background firing rates
[48]. Our results are in accordance with these data, wherein
narrowly tuned neurons were found only within the EB, and the
FB contained only broadly tuned neurons.
Elegant work by Seelig and Jayaraman established that a
certain population of CX neurons encode the fly’s orientation
predominantly relying upon visual landmarks [18]. Their results
indicate that integrating idiothetic cues only may lead to
error accumulation in the fly’s directional code. Our results, how-
ever, showed that the amount of error accumulation is similar
during control and head-covered trials; thus, motion cues alone
are sufficient for cockroaches to maintain a reliable directional
signal (Figures 5 and S4). This difference could stem from
the ecology of the two model animals. Drosophila are diurnal
flying insects that, under natural circumstances, normally have
access to external (visual) cues to update their navigation sys-
tem. Cockroaches, however, are more similar to rats, which
have limited sources of visual landmarks and need a navigation
system that can precisely encode orientation using idiothetic
cues. Together, the results of these studies provide fundamental
insights into general coding strategies relying upon specific
sensory cues whereby the CX may critically mediate insect
navigation.
In summary, our results indicate that the navigational systems
of evolutionarily distinct animals (insects to humans) might rely
upon the same general coding principles, while adjusting the
mechanisms to adapt to specific ecological needs. This similarity
opens up a whole new level of questions regarding the conserva-
tion of navigation and spatial memory.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Additional methods can be found in the Supplemental Information.
Cockroaches were implanted with wire tetrode bundles [49] and head
restrained in a holding tube. The tube was then fixed onto an automated
rotating platform. The platform was located in a cylindrical recording arena
possessing uniformly painted black walls and a single solid white landmark
(60� in extent; Figure 1A). Each recording session involved four or six experi-
mental paradigms (Figure S1). In each paradigm, the cockroach was rotated
around in the arena for four to six trials (360� rotations). Each trial consisted
of 12 3 30� rotations followed by a 10-s immobile period (with data for ana-
lyses restricted to the middle 8 s of this period; Figure 1B). Because of the
head-fixed design, the animals’ field of view was reduced from �270� to
180�; thus, in any position throughout an �120�–150� portion of the arena,
no parts of the landmark were visible to the animal. Recordings were per-
formed using a Neuralynx system. K-means assisted cluster cutting was per-
formed in Spike2 (CED). Data analyses were performed using custom Spike2
scripts, the MATLAB (MathWorks) Circstat toolbox [35], Origin, and in Micro-
soft’s Excel. Data in the results are reported as mean ± SD unless otherwise
noted. Mean firing rate in the text and figures refers to spikes/second.
