ABSTRACT
Studies have estimated the average risk of postdonation ESRD for living kidney donors in the United
States, but personalized estimation on the basis of donor characteristics remains unavailable. We studied
133,824 living kidney donors from 1987 to 2015, as reported to the Organ Procurement and Transplan-
tation Network, with ESRD ascertainment via Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services linkage, using
Cox regression with late entries. Black race (hazard ratio [HR], 2.96; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 2.25
to 3.89; P,0.001) and male sex (HR, 1.88; 95% CI, 1.50 to 2.35; P,0.001) was associated with higher risk of
ESRD in donors. Among nonblack donors, older age was associated with greater risk (HR per 10 years,
1.40; 95% CI, 1.23 to 1.59; P,0.001). Among black donors, older age was not significantly associated with
risk (HR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.72 to 1.09; P=0.3). Greater body mass index was associated with higher risk
(HR per 5 kg/m2, 1.61; 95% CI, 1.29 to 2.00; P,0.001). Donors who had a first-degree biological relation-
ship to the recipient had increased risk (HR, 1.70; 95% CI, 1.24 to 2.34; P,0.01). C-statistic of the model
was 0.71. Predicted 20-year risk of ESRD for the median donor was only 34 cases per 10,000 donors, but 1%
of donors had predicted risk exceeding 256 cases per 10,000 donors. Risk estimation is critical for appro-
priate informed consent and varies substantially across living kidney donors. Greater permissiveness may
be warranted in older black candidate donors; young black candidates should be evaluated carefully.

Long-term studies of living kidney donors have re-
ported low rates of mortality and ESRD1–5; in a
national study of living kidney donors in the United
States, we previously estimated overall ESRD risk to
donors at 31 ESRD cases per 10,000 living kidney
donors in the first 15 years postdonation.2 Recent
draft guidelines on the evaluation of living kidney
donors from Kidney Disease Improving Global
Outcomes (KDIGO) recommend that transplant
centers develop and communicate a threshold of
“acceptable risk” for living kidney donor candi-
dates.6 Under this paradigm, centers would esti-
mate patient-specific risk for each donor candidate,
on the basis of a composite profile of risk factors,
and potentially decline candidates whose estimated
risk exceeds the acceptable risk threshold. However,
although centers have developed ad hoc donor
selection heuristics on the basis of a single risk
factor (e.g., a maximum body mass index [BMI]
cutoff) or a simple combination of risk factors
(e.g., declining donors with hypertension if their
age falls below a minimum value), the KDIGO
guidelines wisely point out that such heuristics
fall short of a comprehensive estimate of patient-
specific risk.

CLINICAL RESEARCH
 To support an empirical approach to donor selection,
Grams et al. developed a calculator to estimate baseline
long-term ESRD risk from patient-specific characteristics in
healthy individuals, on the basis of a meta-analysis of multiple
population cohorts.7 However, these estimates are on the basis
of nondonor populations, and estimate baseline ESRD risk,
i.e., long-term risk of ESRD if the individual does not donate.
Two large cohort studies of individuals who did donate re-
cently reported higher risk of ESRD in living kidney donors
compared with healthy nondonors, consistent across two dif-
ferent populations using two different methods of compari-
son.2,3 Because donation likely increases the risk of ESRD,
postdonation ESRD risk in living kidney donors would be
higher than baseline risk estimated from the Grams calculator
by an unknown amount. Consequently, true risk prediction
for living kidney donors must include not only baseline risk
(if the individual does not donate) but absolute risk (if the
individual does donate) as well. No tool currently exists to
estimate personalized ESRD risk after kidney donation.
To address this knowledge gap, we constructed a prediction
model of ESRD after living kidney donation using national
registry data. The goals of our study were to characterize
risk factors for ESRD in living kidney donors using a multi-
variable framework, and to produce estimates of 5-, 10-, 15-,
and 20-year risk of ESRD for individual donors on the basis of
baseline health and demographics. Additionally, we sought to
incorporate these estimates into an easy-to-use web-based risk
calculator, where a user could provide characteristics of a po-
tential donor and receive estimates of ESRD risk over time.
RESULTS
Study Population
There were 133,824 living kidney donors between 1987 and
2015 in the study population (Table 1). Median (interquartile
range [IQR]) age at donation was 40 (31–48) years; 40.8% of
donors were men, 12.5% were black, and 59.4% had a first-
degree biologic relationship to their recipient (parent, child,
or sibling). Median (IQR) BMI at donation
was 26.6 (23.7–29.7). BMI was missing for
31.0% of donors. We identified 331 cases of
incident ESRD, of which 148 (44.7%) oc-
curred in donors who donated before April
of 1994. Donors who experienced incident
ESRD were more likely to be men (60.4%
versus 40.7%; chi-square P,0.001), black
(34.4% versus 12.5%; P,0.001), and first-
degree biologically related to the recipient
(85.6% versus 59.4%; P,0.001).
Risk Factors for ESRD: Univariable
In unadjusted analysis, cumulative inci-
dence of ESRD was lowest among donors
with BMI,25 and highest among donors
with BMI.30 (Figure 1A) (P,0.01). Cumulative incidence of
ESRD was higher among donors who were first-degree bio-
logically related to their recipient (Figure 1B) (P,0.001).
Among nonblack donors, older age groups had higher

aBMI at donation and relationship to recipient were missing for 31.0% of donors and 0.7% of donors,
respectively. Missingness of BMI was primarily due to incomplete reporting before 1999. In regression
analyses, multiple imputation was used to account for missing data.

 cumulative incidence of ESRD; among black donors, older age
groups had lower risk of ESRD (Figure 2). Among donors
age,45, blacks had higher cumulative incidence of ESRD;
among donors age$45, incidence was roughly equivalent in
black and nonblack donors (Figure 2).
Risk Factors for ESRD: Multivariable
In multivariable analysis, risk of ESRD was higher in male
donors (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 1.88; 95% confidence
interval [CI], 1.50 to 2.35; P,0.001), black donors (aHR at age
40, 2.96; 95% CI, 2.25 to 3.89; P,0.001), and donors who
were first-degree biologic relatives of their recipient (aHR,
1.70; 95% CI, 1.24 to 2.34; P,0.01) (Table 2). Among non-
black donors, older age at donation was associated with higher
risk (aHR per 10 years of age, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.23 to 1.59;
P,0.001). However, among black donors, older age at dona-
tion was nonsignificantly associated with lower risk (aHR per
10 years, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.72 to 1.09; P=0.3; age/race interac-
tion P,0.001). Higher BMI was associated with increased
ESRD risk (aHR per 5 kg/m2, 1.61; 95% CI, 1.29 to 2.00;
P,0.001). In exploratory models, there was no evidence of
change in risk associated with Hispanic ethnicity (aHR, 1.16;
95% CI, 0.75 to 1.80; P=0.5), eGFR (aHR per 10 U, 0.97; 95%
CI, 0.85 to 1.10; P=0.6), right kidney donation versus left kid-
ney donation (aHR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.74 to 1.29; P=0.9), secular
trend in year of donation (aHR per year, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.95 to
1.01; P=0.1), or systolic BP (aHR per 5 mmHg, 1.05; 95% CI,
0.95 to 1.16; P=0.3).
Estimates of 5-, 10-, 15-, and 20-Year ESRD Risk
The C-statistic of the model was 0.71. For comparison, the
C-statistic in this population of a risk calculator previously
published by Ibrahim et al. was 0.57; the C-statistic of that
risk calculator among white donors in this population was
0.64. Among all donors in the study, median (IQR) predicted
risk of ESRD was 1 (1–2) cases per 10,000 donors at 5 years
postdonation; 6 (4–11) per 10,000 at 10 years postdonation; 16
(10–29) per 10,000 at 15 years postdonation; and 34 (20–59)
per 10,000 at 20 years postdonation (Figure 3). However, the
full range of risk was wide: the 1% of donors with lowest
predicted risk had predicted risk below 0.2 cases per 10,000
donors at 5 years postdonation; 1.2 per 10,000 at 10 years
postdonation; three per 10,000 at 15 years postdonation; and
seven per 10,000 at 20 years postdonation (Figure 3). In contrast,
the 1% of donors with highest predicted risk had predicted risk
exceeding eight cases per 10,000 donors at 5 years postdonation;
48 per 10,000 at 10 years postdonation; 125 per 10,000 at
15yearspostdonation;and256per10,000at20yearspostdonation
(Figure 3). Plots of predicted and observed cumulative incidence
of ESRD stratified by race and sex showed good model cali-
bration (Figure 4). A risk calculator can be found at http://
www.transplantmodels.com/donesrd/.
DISCUSSION
In this national study of ESRD in living kidney donors, risk of
ESRD for the median donor in the first 20 years postdonation
was estimated at 34 cases per 10,000 donors. However, esti-
mated risk varied widely according to donor characteristics,
from fewer than seven cases per 10,000 donors (for the 1% of
donors at the lowest estimated risk) to at least 256 cases per
10,000 donors (for the 1% of donors at highest estimated risk).
In general, male donors, black donors, donors with higher
BMI, and donors biologically related to their recipient had
greater risk of ESRD. However, the association between age
at donation and ESRD risk was modified by donor race. In
other words, among nonblack donors, older age was associated
with increased risk; however, among black donors, this asso-
ciation did not hold. The absence of increased risk for older
black donors may be partly due to a selection effect; among
older blacks, individuals predisposed to CKD may manifest
decreased eGFR before donor evaluation and thus be screened
out before donation.
This study estimated cumulative incidence for the median
donor as 16 cases per 10,000 donors at 15 years postdonation,
and 34 cases per 10,000 donors at 20 years postdonation. A

 recent meta-analysis reported pooled cumulative incidence of
ESRD at 1.1% (110 per 10,000) among studies that followed
donors for at least 10 years postdonation.8 However, this es-
timate draws on studies with varying follow-up times and of
heterogeneous populations of donors from many different
countries including South Africa,9 Sweden,10 South Korea,11
Pakistan,12 Singapore,13 and Egypt14 and, as such, may not
apply to any specific patient population.
Our findings that male sex and black race are associated
with ESRD risk are consistent with a 2008 study by Gibney
et al. of 126 living kidney donors who subsequently joined the
deceased donor kidney waitlist. This study reported that black
donors, male donors, and donors who were under age 35 at the
time of donation made up a larger proportion of waitlist reg-
istrants than would be expected on the basis of these groups’
proportion in the general population of donors.15 In contrast
with our study, the Gibney study suggested that younger
age was a risk factor for ESRD. Because the Gibney study
ascertained ESRD based only on waitlist registration, inference
may have been affected by listing practices and perceived suit-
ability of donors with ESRD for kidney transplantation. Fur-
thermore, the authors did not test the interaction between age
and race, and as such their inference about the effect of age was
limited to an average, overall effect.
Our findings are broadly consistent with a recently published
ESRD risk calculator for white kidney donors from Ibrahim
et al.,16 but extended to donors of all races and using a sub-
stantially larger population (133,824 versus 3956). The
Ibrahim calculator estimates ESRD risk in white donors on
the basis of age, BMI, and systolic BP, all measured at time of
donation. Both calculators estimate higher risk for older do-
nors (among nonblack donors) and higher risk for donors
with greater BMI. The Ibrahim calculator did not include
donor sex or relationship to recipient, and was on the basis
of a cohort of white kidney donors. Our calculator did not
include systolic BP, on the basis of exploratory models show-
ing no statistically significant association between systolic BP
and ESRD risk in the national donor cohort. Although our
cohort was substantially larger than the cohort used for the
Ibrahim calculator, their dataset has longer follow-up for do-
nors with measured systolic BP, whereas our dataset relied on
imputation to ascertain BP for donors who donated before
1998. It may be that added risk associated with elevated sys-
tolic BP emerges only gradually for living donors. However,
predictive discrimination among the national kidney donor
population was substantially higher for our model (0.710)
than for the Ibrahim calculator (0.567).

postdonation; 16 (10–29) per 10,000 at 15 years postdonation;
and 34 (20–59) per 10,000 at 20 years postdonation. Predicted risk
of postdonation ESRD for each donor was calculated on the basis
of donor characteristics. The median donor had 34 per 10,000
predicted risk of ESRD at 20 years postdonation. Half of all donors
have predicted risk between the two dashed lines, but 1% of donors
had predicted 20-year ESRD risk exceeding 256 per 10,000.

 Our identification of BMI and donor sex as risk factors for
ESRD in living kidney donors was in contrast with a recent
national study of ESRD in Norwegian donors and healthy
nondonor controls, which reported no association between
these characteristics and ESRD risk.3 There are several poten-
tial explanations for the discrepancy. Notably, donors made up
only 5.5% of the Norwegian cohort; the investigators com-
pared donors to healthy nondonors but did not investigate
interaction between donor status and ESRD risk, so associa-
tions in this study were likely driven by the much larger
nondonor cohort. Also, the Norwegian study had only
34,522 participants (31 ESRD events), whereas our study has
133,824 participants (331 events), allowing for more precise
estimation of the association. Differences in risk between
Norwegians and Americans (or differences between donor
selection in Norway and America) may have affected results.
Our study was also able to explore potential risk factors not
included in the Norwegian study, including donor race and
biologic relationship to the recipient.
A recent KDIGO-led study estimated risk of ESRD in
healthy potential donors in the absence of kidney donation
(“healthy nondonors”),7 on the basis of donor candidate char-
acteristics. This study projected higher risk of ESRD in blacks
than in whites, and higher risk in men than in women (e.g.,
baseline 15-year risk of ESRD at age 40 was estimated at 0.24%
for black men, 0.15% for black women, 0.06% for white men,
and 0.04% for white women). However, among donor candi-
dates age#60 years, increased age was associated with in-
creased risk of ESRD within 15 years, across categories of
race and sex (e.g., baseline risk at age 60 was estimated at
0.32% for black men, 0.18% for black women, 0.13% for
white men, and 0.08% for white women). The contrast be-
tween results from this study and our findings may result from
donor selection practices; for example, older blacks at risk of
ESRD but classified as “healthy” in the KDIGO study may be
more reluctant to donate, or less likely to be cleared for do-
nation. The Grams study reported a relatively modest associ-
ation between BMI and ESRD risk (HR, 1.16 [95% CI, 1.04 to
1.29] per 5 kg/m2 among individuals with BMI.30). In con-
trast, in our population a 5-U increase in BMI was associated
with 61% higher risk across the range of BMI, suggesting that
the effect of obesity on ESRD risk might be worse when living
with only one kidney and the physiologic changes that occur
postdonation. The KDIGO model has the advantage of a larger
population and more covariates. By contrast, our model is
limited to the population of people who have actually under-
gone living donor nephrectomy, and our covariates are limited
to those collected by the Organ Procurement and Transplan-
tation Network (OPTN). However, unlike the KDIGO calcu-
lator, our calculator estimates actual postdonation risk rather
than baseline risk—a critical question both for candidates
considering donation, and for living kidney donors wishing
to understand and minimize their future risk.
Our study must be understood in the context of its limita-
tions. By definition, our study population consists of individ-
uals who were cleared for donation. In other words, predicted
risk for a given donorcandidate reflects risk among individuals
with similar characteristics who were cleared to donate; risk to
an individual with similar characteristics from the general
population might be higher. We were only able to study risk
factors captured in the national donor registry, meaning that
we cannot draw firm inference with regard to characteristics
that were only measured in recent years (e.g., serum creatinine,
smoking status) or not at all (e.g., glucose tolerance, albumin-
to-creatinine ratio). Our estimate of risk associated with BMI
relies on multiple imputation, because BMI was missing for
31% of donors. However, misspecification of the imputation
model would likely bias toward the null. Despite these limita-
tions, our estimates of ESRD risk on the basis of donor age,
sex, race, and BMI improve dramatically upon prior estimates,
and provide a usable calculator to help with shared clinical
decision-making and to respond to the new KDIGO-
recommended acceptable risk paradigm.
Living kidney donors voluntarily undergo surgery for no
direct medical benefit to themselves; it is therefore incumbent
upon the transplant community to provide donors with accu-
rate estimates of long-term risk to improve shared decision
making and to provide clinical decision support in the donor
evaluation process. Our risk prediction model can be of use to
individuals considering donation, and to living donors and
their care providers in planning long-term follow-up care
and health maintenance.
CONCISE METHODS
Study Population
This study used data from the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recip-
ients (SRTR). The SRTR data system includes data on all donors,
waitlisted candidates, and transplant recipients in the United States,
submitted by the members of the OPTN, and has been described
elsewhere.17 The Health Resources and Services Administration, US
Department of Health and Human Services provides oversight to the
activities of the OPTN and SRTR contractors. The study population
consisted of living kidney donors in the United States between Oc-
tober 1, 1987 and December 31, 2015 as ascertained from the SRTR
database. Donors with missing race or age at donation (n=77; 0.06%
of donors) were excluded from analysis.
Outcome Ascertainment
Donors were followed from date of donation to death, ESRD diag-
nosis, or end of study on December 31, 2015. Death was ascertained
through standard OPTN follow-up and via linkage to the Social
Security Death Master File. Incident ESRD was ascertained from
the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Form 2728.
Although Form 2728 has been available since 1973, reporting of
incident ESRD became mandatory for non-Medicare patients in
1994. Because the study population includes donors since 1986,
person-time before April 1, 1994 was treated as immortal. In other
words, patients who donated before April of 1994 did not contribute

CLINICAL RESEARCH
 person-time to the study until that date, and entered the study on that
date as late entries. Donors with documented ESRD before April 1,
1994 (n=7) were excluded from analysis. Donors who were diagnosed
with ESRD within 30 days of donation (n=17) were also excluded from
analysis, under the assumption that these patients underwent AKI
during nephrectomy rather than CKD as a long-term consequence
of living with one kidney.
Risk Factors for ESRD
We used Kaplan–Meier curves and logrank tests to compare ESRD
incidence across donor subgroups (univariable analysis), and Cox
regression to model risk of ESRD in living kidney donors as a func-
tion of sex, age, race (classified as black versus nonblack), interaction
between age and race, first-degree biologic relationship to recipient,
and BMI (multivariable analysis). Because of substantial missingness
in BMI (which was not widely collected before 1999), we used mul-
tiple imputation with chained equations (20 burn-in iterations and
50 imputations) to account for missing data, accounting for exposure
time as per the methods of White and Royston.18
Estimates of 5-, 10-, 15-, and 20-Year ESRD Risk
We calculated predictive discrimination of the model by calculating
the Harrell C statistic, usinga custom implementation of the Harrell C
as previously described.19 For comparison, we also calculated the
Harrell C statistic on the ESRD risk calculator for white kidney do-
nors previously published by Ibrahim et al., among the 79,389 donors
in our study populationwith recorded BMI and systolic BP.16 We used
baseline hazard curves and HRs obtained from the Cox models
described above to calculate estimated cumulative incidence of
ESRD at 5, 10, 15, and 20 years as a function of donor characteristics.
In other words, given baseline cumulative hazard function H0(t), and
coefficient vector b, the cumulative hazard function for a donor with
covariate vector X was calculated by H(t) = H03ebX. Cumulative
incidence I at time t was calculated by I(t) = 12e2H(t). We checked
the validity of our models by producing graphs of observed and
predicted ESRD, stratified by sex, race, and BMI (in categories of ,25,
25–30, and 30–35 kg/m2).
Sensitivity Analyses for Handling of Immortal Person-
Time
Because ESRD outcome ascertainment was not comprehensive before
start-of-study on April 1, 1994, we treated person-time between date
of donation and April 1, 1994 as immortal, as described above. It is
likely that a few donors experienced incident ESRD before start-of-
study, and did not have their ESRD reported to CMS. Our analysis
mistakenly classifies these donors as ESRD-free until death or end-of-
study. Therefore, our estimates of ESRD incidence would be biased
downward, although the bias was probably very slight because ESRD
in the first few years postdonation is a rare outcome. In order to
quantify the bias introduced byour methods, we used our Cox models
to estimate cumulative incidence of ESRD during immortal person-
time for all donors who donated before the beginning of the study
period, as a function of donor age, race, and sex. For example, for a
donor who donated on April 1, 1990, we calculated estimated cumu-
lative incidence of ESRD 4 years after donation. The sum of these
cumulative incidence figures gives an estimate of the number of ESRD
cases in donors before start-of-study. We repeated this procedure on
100 bootstrapped samples to obtain a 95% confidence interval for
number of missed ESRD cases before April 1, 1994. Among 14,681
donors who donated before that date, the estimated number of
unobserved ESRD cases was 1.2. A bootstrap with 100 repetitions
gave a 95% confidence interval of 0.7 to 1.7 missed cases. In other
words, an estimated 0.01% of our late entries (0.002% of all study
participants) may be false negatives (missed ESRD cases); this num-
ber is too small to meaningfully affect our estimates of cumulative
ESRD incidence.
As anadditionalsensitivity analysis, we repeated our main analyses
usingonlydonorswhodonatedonorafterApril1,1994;inferencewas
consistent with our main findings.
Statistical Analyses
All analyses were performed using Stata 14.1/MP for Windows (College
Station, TX).
