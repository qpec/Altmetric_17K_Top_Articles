may play a key role in the biological and physiological basis of neurodevelopmental, age-related
and neurodegenerative disorders. The routes of communication between the microbiota and
brain are being unravelled and include the vagus nerve, gut hormone signalling, the immune
system, tryptophan metabolism or by way of microbial metabolites such as short chain fatty
acids. The importance of early life gut microbiota in shaping future health outcomes is also
emerging. Disturbances of this composition by way of antibiotic exposure, lack of breastfeeding,
infection, stress and the environmental influences coupled with the influence of host genetics
can result in long-term effects on physiology and behaviour, at least in animal models. It is
also worth noting that mode of delivery at birth influences microbiota composition with those
born by Caesarean section having a distinctly different microbiota in early life to those born per
vaginum. At the other extreme of life, ageing is associated with a narrowing in microbial diversity
and healthy ageing correlates with a diverse microbiome. Recently, the gut microbiota has been
implicated in a variety of conditions including depression, autism, schizophrenia and Parkinson’s
disease. There is still considerable debate as to whether or not the gut microbiota changes are
core to the pathophysiology of such conditions or are merely epiphenomenal. It is plausible that
such neuropsychiatric disorders might be treated in the future by targeting the microbiota either
by microbiota transplantation, antibiotics or psychobiotics.

Introduction
Claude Bernard, William James, Ivan Pavlov and Walter
Cannon, the fathers of modern physiology, have all
described the bidirectional communication between the
gut and the brain and its importance in maintaining
homeostasis (Aziz & Thompson, 1998; Mayer, 2011).
However, over the past decade increasing emphasis
has been placed on the role of intestinal micro-
biota in regulating the gut–brain axis. Concurrently,
a growing body of evidence points to the microbiota
playing a significant role in modulating brain function
and behaviour and that the microbiota–gut–brain axis
is poised as a bidirectional communication pathway
enabling gut microbes to communicate with the brain, and
the brain with the gut (Rhee et al. 2009; Canfora et al. 2015;
Foster et al. 2016). The mechanisms of communication are
complex and are slowly being unravelled; they include
immune, neural, endocrine and metabolic pathways
(Grenham et al. 2011; Mayer et al. 2014a; El Aidy et al.
2015; Koh et al. 2016; Sommer & Backhed, 2016). Pre-
clinical studies have implicated the vagus nerve as a key
route of neural communication between gut microbes and
centrally mediated behavioural effects, as demonstrated
by the prevention of the in vivo effects of specific bacterial
strains by selective vagotomy (Bravo et al. 2011; Bercik
et al. 2011b). The gut microbiota also regulates key
central neurotransmitters by altering levels of precursors;
for example Bifidobacterium infantis has been shown to
elevateplasmatryptophanlevelsandthusinfluencecentral
5-HT transmission (Desbonnet et al. 2008; O’Mahony
et al. 2015a). Furthermore, synthesis and release of
neurotransmitters from bacteria has been reported; the
inhibitoryneurotransmitterγ-aminobutyricacid(GABA)
can be produced by Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium
species, whereas Escherichia, Bacillus and Saccharomyces
spp. can produce noradrenaline (norepinephrine). On
the other hand Candida, Streptococcus, Escherichia and
Enterococcusspp.havebeenreportedtoproduceserotonin,
and Bacillus can produce dopamine, whereas certain
Lactobacillus spp. can produce acetylcholine (Lyte, 2013,
2014; Wall et al. 2014). These microbially synthesised
neurotransmitters can cross the mucosal layer of the
intestines, and possibly mediate physiological events in
the brain.
Short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), which include
propionate, butyrate and acetate, are important metabolic
products of gut microbial activity and may exert central
effects indirectly or directly either through G-protein
coupled receptors or in the case of butyrate as an
epigenetic modulator acting through histone deacetylases
(HDACs) (Galland, 2014; Stilling et al. 2014, 2016; Paul
et al. 2015). Moreover, SCFAs are involved in a plethora
of physiological functions ranging from energy balance
and metabolism to the modulation of adipose tissue,
liver tissue and skeletal muscle function (Canfora et al.

2015). Immune signalling from gut to brain mediated
by cytokine molecules is another documented route of
communication (El Aidy et al. 2014). The epithelial layer
of the gut and its mucous layer have many functions,
including the regulation of nutrient and fluid absorption
from the gut lumen in addition to serving as a physical
barrier from invading pathogens or harmful substances
(Farhadi et al. 2003; Scaldaferri et al. 2012; Johansson
et al. 2013; Kelly et al. 2015). Interactions between
microbes and the immune system of the gut help the
latter to identify self and non-self antigens and potentially
harmful pathogens (Fasano, 2012; Sonnenberg & Artis,
2012; Kamada et al. 2013; Sommer & Backhed, 2013).
The
hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal
(HPA)
axis,
which provides the core regulation of the stress response,
can significantly impact the microbiota–gut–brain axis
(O’Mahony et al. 2009, 2011, 2015b; Scott et al. 2013;
Moloney et al. 2014; Tillisch, 2014; Wang & Kasper,
2014). It is increasingly clear and probably of relevance
in a number of pathological conditions that psychological
or physical stress can significantly dysregulate the
microbiota–gut–brain, for example in irritable bowel
syndrome (Dinan et al. 2006).
Multiple lines of approach have been used to interrogate
the microbiota–gut–brain axis, especially in animal model
systems; these include the use of microbiota deficient
animalsknownasgerm-freemice,specificbacterialspecies
often incorrectly referred to as probiotics, antibiotics,
animals exposed to pathogens and the use of stress to
determine the effects of dysregulating the HPA axis. There
is an emerging consensus, at least from animal studies,
that the gut microbiota plays a pivotal role in regulating
early brain development (Bercik et al. 2012; Collins et al.
2012; Mayer et al. 2014a; Borre et al. 2014; Sampson
& Mazmanian, 2015). Determining the mechanisms and
pathways underlying microbiota–brain interactions is an
exciting and evolving area of research that may yield
novel insights into individual variations and perhaps
enable the development of new treatments for a range
of neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders,
ranging from autism to Parkinson’s disease. Moreover,
there is increased emphasis on understanding the factors
contributing to healthy brain ageing and the microbiome
is poised to play a crucial role here. Here we will review
important recent findings in the field.
Maturation and decline of bacterial gut microbiota
It is generally estimated that the gut is inhabited by
1013–1014 microorganisms, although the ratio of micro-
bial to human cells has been recently revised downward
(Sender et al. 2016). In terms of genes we have over
100 times as many genes in our microbiome as we have
in our genome. The total weight of these gut microbes is
1–2 kg, which is similar to the weight of the human brain
(Stilling et al. 2014). Mammals have never existed without
microbes, except in laboratory situations. The reality
is that we have co-evolved, and we are fundamentally
dependent upon our colonisers for survival, as of course
are they on us (Bordenstein & Theis, 2015).
With over 1000 species and greater than 7000 strains
the microbiota is an ecosystem dominated by bacteria,
mainly strict anaerobes, but also includes other micro-
organisms such as viruses and bacteriophages, protozoa,
archaea and fungi (Lankelma et al. 2015). At a phylum
level the microbiome is largely defined by two dominant
bacterial
phylotypes,
Bacteroidetes
and
Firmicutes
with Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Fusobacteria and
Verrucomicrobia
phyla
present
in
relatively
low
abundance (Qin et al. 2010; Lankelma et al. 2015).
Colonisation of the infant gut for the most part
begins at birth, when delivery through the birth canal
exposes the infant to its mother’s microbiota and thus
initiates an initial maternal signature to the micro-
biota (Donnet-Hughes et al. 2010; Collado et al. 2012;
Matamoros et al. 2013; Backhed et al. 2015). The impact
of mode of delivery, be it vaginal birth or Caesarean
section (C. section) on neonatal microbial composition
is now being appreciated. Indeed, C. section results
in an altered microbial composition in the neonate
resembling that of the mother’s skin with Staphylococcus,
Corynebacterium and Propionibacterium spp. dominating
in comparison with vaginally delivered infants whose
microbiome is more akin to that from the mother’s
vagina, which have a predominance of Lactobacillus, Pre-
votella or Sneathia spp. (Dominguez-Bello et al. 2010).
Moreover, this signature has been shown to persist into
adulthood with a distinctly different faecal microbiota
composition being detected in those individuals who
have been born by C. section (Goedert et al. 2014),
compared with their natural born counterparts (but see
Yassour et al. 2016). Significant differences in micro-
biota composition have been described between preterm
and normal-term neonates (Barrett et al. 2013, 2015).
Barrettandcolleagues(2013)showedthatpreterminfants,
albeit just two infants, lacked two of the main bacterial
genera seen in normal-term infants: Bifidobacterium and
Lactobacillus, with a compensatory dominance of the
Proteobacteria observed. It is worth noting that there is
a growing appreciation of the connection between micro-
bial composition and the nutritional needs of the infant
host (Voreades et al. 2014). Indeed exclusively breastfed
infants display an increase in the relative composition of
Bifidobacterium species that have evolved specifically to
utilise human milk oligosaccharides (Costello et al. 2012;
Hinde & Lewis, 2015). Each diet induces a specialised
microbiota with the capability of microbial digestion
of that specific diet. Indeed, an increase in the relative
composition of strict anaerobes as a function of diet
and environment occurs early in life, and a complex

adult-like microbiome emerges by the age of 1 year old.
Although inter-individual variations in the composition
of gut microbiota is apparent, an internal balance exists
that confers a propensity towards health benefits (Gilbert
et al. 2016), whereas perturbations in this ecosystem
has the potential to negatively impact health, increasing
vulnerability to a range of diseases (Sankar et al. 2015;
Gilbert et al. 2016). Infection, disease, diet and antibiotics
are among the many factors that may change microbial
composition(Borreetal.2014).However,thecomposition
tends to revert to its previous level of diversity once
the distorting factor has subsided (Vandenplas, 2015).
This is especially true in relation to antibiotic exposure
(Blaser, 2014), but far less so in relation to dietary patterns
which tend to be relatively permanent. Taken together it
is clear that infancy is a critical period for both micro-
biota colonisation and neurodevelopment. Thus, the time
is now ripe for longitudinal studies to assess the impact
of altered microbiota composition in early life on neuro-
cognitive function in humans (Yang et al. 2016).
Major shifts in diet in adults likewise show dramatic
changes in microbiota composition (David et al. 2014).
It is clear from studies of remote hunter-gatherer tribes
that Western guts have undergone a significant reduction
in bacterial diversity and globalisation is driving this
trend forward (Leach, 2013; Schnorr et al. 2014; Clemente
et al. 2015; Martinez et al. 2015; Rampelli et al. 2015;
Sonnenburg et al. 2016).
As we age, it has been shown that the core microbiota
undergoes a dynamic shift (Claesson et al. 2011). Such
age-related changes in the composition, and in particular
the diversity, of the microbiota correlate with health
outcomes in the elderly, especially in the context of frailty
measures (O’Toole & Jeffery, 2015; Zapata & Quagliarello,
2015). Of interest is the fact that the number of probiotic
Bifidobacteria strains decreases with age (Rondanelli et al.
2015). Recent studies in centenarians have reinforced the
importance of microbial diversity in maintaining health
as we age (Biagi et al. 2016). Thus it is becoming clear that
maintaining a healthy microbiome is crucial to having a
healthy brain across the lifespan from cradle to grave (see
Fig. 1).
Microbiota and brain development
Germ-free mice have been instrumental in highlighting
a key role of the microbiota in early brain development
(Gareau, 2014; Sampson & Mazmanian, 2015; Luczynski
et al. 2016a). Key changes in multiple neurotransmitter
systems and their receptors have been described in a
variety of different brain regions in germ-free mice. Using
a genome-wide transcriptomic approach Diaz Heijtz
and colleagues (2011) demonstrated that germ-free mice
have an upregulation of genes associated with a variety
of plasticity and metabolic pathways including synaptic
long-term potentiation, steroid hormone metabolism,
and cyclic adenosine 5-phosphate-mediated signalling. Of
note, the cerebellum and hippocampus were the two most
sensitised brain areas to such changes in gene expression,
with the hypothalamus being relatively resistant. The
serotonergic system is particularly vulnerable to early-life
manipulations of the microbiome. We have shown
that germ-free mice have a marked increase in 5-HT
concentrations in the hippocampus (Clarke et al. 2013),
whereas Neufeld and colleagues have shown a decreased
5-HT1A receptor gene expression in the hippocampal
dentate gyrus of female germ-free animals using in situ
hybridisation (Neufeld et al. 2011). Brain-derived neuro-
trophic factor (BDNF) is an important plasticity-related
protein that promotes neuronal growth, development
and survival and plays a key role in learning, memory
and mood regulation. In germ-free mice, Bdnf expression
is lower in the cortex and amygdala compared with
controls (Diaz Heijtz et al. 2011). In the hippocampus,
the changes in Bdnf levels documented are inconsistent
with some studies reporting an increase (Neufeld et al.
2011), whereas most others show a decrease in expression
(Sudo et al. 2004; Diaz Heijtz et al. 2011; Gareau et al.
2011; Clarke et al. 2013).
Somewhat intriguingly, many of the CNS alterations,
including changes in BDNF levels found in germ-free
mice occur in a sex-specific manner with only male
germ-free animals exhibiting the serotonergic alterations
described above as well as the decrease in Bdnf expression
(Clarke et al. 2013). Germ-free mice have been shown to
have modest increases in hippocampal volume and the
pyramidal neurons within the ventral hippocampus were
shorter and less branched, and had deficits in the number
of stubby and mushroom spines. On the other hand
decreased branching was observed for dentate granule
cells without any overt change at the spine density level
in germ-free mice (Luczynski et al. 2016b). The birth of
new neurons in the adult hippocampus, neurogenesis,
plays a critical role in modulating learning and memory
and in mediating the behavioural responses to stress and
antidepressant drugs (O’Leary & Cryan, 2014). Recent
data using germ-free animals have shown that neuro-
genesis is also regulated by the microbiome. Germ-free
mice exhibit increased adult hippocampal neurogenesis in
the dorsal hippocampus (Ogbonnaya et al. 2015). Post-
weaning microbial colonisation of germ-free mice failed
to reverse the changes in adult hippocampal neurogenesis,
suggesting that a critical window exists in the pre-weaning
periodduringwhichthemicrobiotaexertsitsinfluenceson
adult hippocampal neurogenesis (Ogbonnaya et al. 2015).
Intriguingly antibiotic administration, which depletes the
microbiota, to adult animals actually decreases neuro-
genesis. Moreover, this effect was reversed by exercise
or administration of a probiotic cocktail (Mohle et al.
2016).

The effects of the microbiome on brain development
are not specific to the hippocampus with data emerging
that there are alterations in amygdala function as well.
The amygdala is a critical brain area for social behaviour
as well as being a key node for the gating of anxiety and
fear-related behaviour (Ledoux, 2007; Stilling et al. 2015).
Structural and functional changes in the amygdala are
associated with a variety of neuropsychiatric disorders
ranging from autism spectrum (Schumann & Amaral,
2006; Mosconi et al. 2009) to anxiety disorders (Ledoux,
2007; Janak & Tye, 2015). Germ-free mice have increased
amygdala volume and have dendritic hypertrophy in the
basolateral amygdala (BLA). Moreover, the pyramidal
neurons of the BLA in germ-free mice have more
thin, stubby and mushroom spines compared to mice
with normal microbiota (Luczynski et al. 2016b). Using
RNA-sequencing significant differences at the levels of
differential gene expression, exon usage and RNA editing
were found in the amygdala. The expression of immediate
early response genes such as Fos, Fosb, Egr2 or Nr4a1 were
increased in the amygdala of germ-free mice in concert
with increased signalling of the transcription factor
CREB in germ-free mice (Stilling et al. 2015). Moreover,
differential expression and recoding of several genes
involved in fundamental brain processes ranging from
neuronal plasticity, metabolism, neurotransmission and
morphology were identified. A significant downregulation
was noted for immune system-related genes (Stilling et al.
2015), which is in line with the underdeveloped immune
system and immature microglia reported in germ-free
mice (Erny et al. 2015). This adds further evidence to a
key role of the immune system in mediating the effects of
themicrobiotaonbrainphysiologyandbehaviour.Indeed,
the recently discovered lymphatic branches in the central
nervous system may be one such mechanism (Louveau
et al. 2015).

A growing body of evidence suggests that gut microbiota is essential to human health and is a key player in the
bidirectional communication across the gut–brain axis. The microbiota dynamically changes across the lifespan,
establishing its relationship with the host at critical windows during infancy, adolescence and ageing. At these
time windows, there is an increased vulnerability to external insults, which may result in enhanced susceptibility to
brain disorders. Early life disturbance of the developing gut microbiota has the potential to significantly impact on
neurodevelopment and potentially lead to adverse mental health outcomes later in life. Similarly, the microbiota
may contribute to the ageing process and the trajectory of neurodegenerative disorders.

involved in myelination and myelin plasticity processes in
the prefrontal cortex but not other brain areas investigated
(Hoban et al. 2016). Similar findings have also emerged in
adult animals treated with antibiotics (Gacias et al. 2016).
It should be noted that although germ-free mice have
been instrumental in advancing all aspects of micro-
biome research including microbiome-to-brain signalling
(Grover & Kashyap, 2014; Luczynski et al. 2016a), there are
many challenges in their use. This is especially true with
regards to the marked alterations in the immune system
and gastrointestinal tract and in terms of lacking any
true clinical translation (Nguyen et al. 2015; Al-Asmakh
& Zadjali, 2015; Arrieta et al. 2016). That said the pre-
clinical use of germ-free mice is not to directly mimic the
human condition but to provide a platform to explore the
role of bacteria on host development and function and
answer the question whether the microbiome is involved
or not (Nguyen et al. 2015; Faith et al. 2014; Al-Asmakh &
Zadjali, 2015; Arrieta et al. 2016). Nonetheless, germ-free
micehavelimitedutilitytoaddressexperimentalquestions
regarding the impact of altered microbiota composition
that first occurs later in life. Thus studies using antibiotic
treatment have proven useful complementary alternatives.
Antibiotic treatment has also been shown to affect other
brain neurodevelopment processes. Indeed, antibiotic
treatment in adult mice alters BDNF protein levels in
both the amygdala and hippocampus (Bercik et al. 2011a).
On the other hand administration of antibiotics early
in life to male rats has been shown to increase visceral
hypersensitivity in adulthood without affecting anxiety,
cognitive, immune or stress-related responses (O’Mahony
et al. 2014). The increased visceral hypersensitivity was
paralleled by specific changes in the spinal expression of
pain-associated genes (transient receptor potential cation
channel subfamily V member 1, the α-2A adrenergic
receptor and cholecystokinin B receptor) (O’Mahony et al.
2014). More recently we targeted the adolescent period
in mice whereby many of the phenotypic changes in
germ-free mice could be recapitulated by treating with
antibiotics. Indeed, at a behavioural level, post-weaning
depletion of the gut microbiota led to reduced anxiety
coupled with cognitive deficits (Desbonnet et al. 2015).
Moreover, at a neurochemical level in the adult brain
altered tryptophan metabolism was observed coupled
with significantly reduced BDNF, oxytocin and vaso-
pressin expression in adolescent antibiotic-treated mice
(Desbonnet et al. 2015).
Role for the microbiota in neurological conditions?
A growing body of evidence, originating with studies
in
irritable
bowel
syndrome,
has
implicated
the
microbiota–gut–brain
axis
in
the
pathogenesis
of
stress-related disorders (De Palma et al. 2014; Moloney
et al. 2015). Recently, however, the gut microbiota
has been implicated in other brain disorders including
autism, schizophrenia and Parkinson’s disease. There is
still considerable debate and much research needed to
determine whether or not gut microbiota changes are core
to the pathophysiology of such conditions or are merely
epiphenomenal.
Autism. Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neuro-
developmental disorder with a clear genetic basis whose
prevalence is on the increase (Ziats et al. 2015). Autism
is characterised by a constellation of symptoms including
deficits in social behaviour, communication and inter-
action across multiple domains and repetitive, narrow
repertoire of patterns of behaviour, interests, or activities
(Chen et al. 2015). In general, symptoms emerge early
in the developmental period and significantly impair
social and occupational functioning. Although genetics
is key in autism pathogenesis there is a very strong
gene–environment interaction at play with over 50% of
the neurobiology driven by non-heritable factors (Chen
et al. 2015). Moreover, up to 70% of patients with the
syndrome co-present with gastrointestinal symptoms and
hence the view that a disruption of the gut–brain axis is
involved (Mayer et al. 2014b).
Another facet contributing to social deficits in this
condition is a lack of social recognition, a symptom which
can be modelled in animals. Our group examined the
behaviour of germ-free mice in the three-chamber test,
a well-validated assay to assess social behaviour (Moy
et al. 2004), where a germ-free mouse was placed in the
centre chamber with a familiar mouse in one chamber
and a novel mouse in the other chamber (Desbonnet
et al. 2014). Interestingly, germ-free mice spent as much
time with the familiar as with the novel mouse; this is
in contrast to the behaviour of conventionally colonised
mice who spend more time with the novel than the
familiar mouse. Germ-free mice are more likely to
spend time with an object or an empty chamber than
with another mouse, a decidedly abnormal behaviour
for a sociable animal. Colonisation of the germ-free
mice does partially normalise their behavioural patterns
especiallyinthecontextofsociabilitydeficitsandincreased
repetitive behaviours – hallmark traits of autism; however,
social cognitive deficits remained despite colonisation
(Desbonnet et al. 2014). These behavioural changes are
also associated with significant alterations in underlying
neurochemistry and gene expression (Stilling et al. 2015;
Hoban et al. 2016). These findings of social deficits in
germ-free mice have recently been replicated (Buffington
et al. 2016) but opposite findings have also been reported
(Arentsen et al. 2015).
Preclinical work demonstrated that the microbiota
modulates behavioural and selective gastrointestinal
abnormalities associated with autism and other neuro-
developmental disorders (Hsiao et al. 2013). The authors

used the maternal immune activation model induced by
Polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly-IC) injection during
pregnancy and found altered gastrointestinal barrier
defectsandmicrobiotaalterations.Dietaryadministration
of the human commensal Bacteroides fragilis, given
three times during adolescence, was sufficient to correct
gut permeability as well as stereotyped and other
abnormal behaviours. Interestingly, as in our germ-free
studies following recolonisation (Desbonnet et al. 2014)
social cognition deficits were insensitive to reversal by
the bacteria. Furthermore, metabolomics approaches
identified a number of bacteria-derived metabolites that
may be involved in the autism-related behaviours and that
were sensitive to manipulation by Bacteroides fragilis.
In humans, prenatal exposure to the mood stabiliser
valproate is a major risk-factor for autism (Christensen
et al. 2013). It is of interest that de Theije and colleagues
have shown that the autism-like behavioural changes
that occur in mouse models of valproate exposure are
coincident with alterations in microbiota (de Theije et al.
2014). Sex differences were observed in these studies,
which is in agreement with the clinical literature in autism
(Young & Pfaff, 2014).
Clinically, a number of relatively underpowered studies
investigating the faecal microbiota in patients with
autism spectrum disorder have been reported (Mayer
et al. 2014b; Rosenfeld, 2015). Tomova and colleagues
examined the microbiota in Slovakian children and noted
a significant decrease of the Bacteroidetes/Firmicutes ratio
and increases in the amount of Lactobacillus spp. and a
modest elevation in Desulfovibrio spp. in the faecal micro-
biota (Tomova et al. 2015). Administration of a probiotic
diet was shown to normalise the Bacteroidetes/Firmicutes
ratio and Desulfovibrio spp. levels in these children. In
a recent study no significant difference in microbiota
diversity or composition was detected between autistic
children with their neurotypical siblings (Son et al.
2015). On analysis of the 16S rRNA sequencing data
an increase in the low abundance Chloroplast genus was
observed in ASD. However, the authors caution that
such changes could reflect a relatively high ingestion of
chia seeds by these children reinforcing the strong link
between diet and microbiome analysis and the need for
dietary information in any cross-sectional or intervention
study of the microbiome in human samples. As recently
summarised by Mayer and colleagues there is a paucity of
large comprehensive studies of the microbiome in autism
(Mayer et al. 2014b). Again the issue of chicken or egg
emerges; are these changes induced by stereotyped diets
seen in many individuals as a product of obsessional
behaviour patterns? Also the heterogeneous nature of
the disease needs to be taken into account and much
more effort is needed to tease out the precise role of the
microbiome in both the aetiology and treatment of the
disorder.
Increasing attention is currently being paid to oxytocin,
the hypothalamic peptide which has been shown to
increase sociability. The oxytocin receptor knockout
mouse shows considerable deficits in social behaviour
(Chini et al. 2014), and intriguingly, a recent study
demonstrated that a probiotic bacterium (Lactobacillus
reutri) can influence hypothalamic posterior pituitary
activity and increase oxytocin levels raising the possibility
of influencing social behaviour by targeting the gut micro-
biota (Erdman & Poutahidis, 2014). Moreover, a recent
study found that in a mouse model of maternal obesity
(a risk factor for autism in humans) there were alterations
in social behaviour, oxytocin cell numbers, synaptic
plasticity and microbiota composition. Remarkably,
Lactobacillus
reuteri
could
reverse
these
changes
(Buffington et al. 2016). Some preliminary studies in
humans indicate that intra-nasally administered oxytocin
may positively alter social behaviour patterns (Yatawara
et al. 2016), and a series of large clinical trials are under-
way to test oxytocin and related therapies for autism
spectrum disorder (Shen, 2015). However, there is still

Schizophrenia. Schizophrenia
is
another
neuro-
developmental disorder and one of the most debilitating
illnesses
affecting
relatively
young
people,
usually
commencing in the late teens and early twenties
(Miyamoto et al. 2012). There is a global prevalence of
around 1% and the condition is characterised by altered
thought processes (delusions and hallucinations) and
frequently a deterioration in cognitive functioning. For
most patients the condition is life-long, often with chronic
psychosocial deterioration. Current treatments, which
primarily target the dopaminergic system, are either
ineffective or only partially effective in many patients.
There is thus a major requirement for the emergence of
alternative, more effective therapeutic targets.
The microbiota has come under the spotlight in relation
to the condition. Certain drugs such as phencyclidine
(PCP) are used to model schizophrenia-like syndromes
(Moghaddam & Javitt, 2012). In rodents sub-chronic
PCP treatment induces cognitive deficits and hyper-
locomotor activity. Recently it was found that in rodents,
sub-chronic PCP significantly altered the gut microbiota
and that such changes correlated highly with memory
performance (Pyndt Jorgensen et al. 2015). Interestingly,
administration of the antibiotic ampicillin blocked the
PCP-induced memory deficits. The authors speculate
that the cognitive deficits seen in some patients with

receptors, and is one of the most widely prescribed anti-
psychotics, exerts significant impact on the gut microbiota
(Davey et al. 2013). Indeed, recent studies from our group
(Davey et al. 2012; 2013) and others (Morgan et al. 2014;
Bahr et al. 2015) point to a key role of the microbiome in
manifestingantipsychotic-inducedweightgain.Agrowing
body of literature is now focusing on the collateral impact
of various medications outside of CNS drugs on micro-
biome composition (Lu et al. 2015; Spanogiannopoulos
et al. 2016).
Reviewing the clinical literature we have argued (Dinan
et al. 2014) strongly that genomic studies in schizophrenia
should include a study of microbial DNA. In support of
thisarecentinvestigationhasfoundthatantibiotictherapy
that alters the gut microbiota can be used to potentiate the
action of antipsychotics in patients with schizophrenia
(Khodaie-Ardakani et al. 2014). What we lack at this point
is any detailed analysis of the gut microbiota in patients
with the disorder.
Microbiota and ageing. Over 100 years ago the Pasteur
Institute’s Elie Metchnikoff received the Nobel Prize
for his discovery of the macrophage (Cryan & Dinan,
2015). Later in his career he focused on the concept
of longevity and proposed that people lived longer in
parts of Bulgaria and Eastern Europe because of the high
amount of fermented foods containing lactic acid bacteria
that they eat (Mackowiak, 2013). With the advent of
germ-free mice in the 1940s, which lived longer than their
conventionalised controls (Gustafsson, 1946; Glimstedt,
1959), it became clear that there was a direct link
between microbiota and senescence. More recently, with
the ELDERMET study, the relationship between micro-
biota and functional outcomes in the elderly, especially
in terms of frailty, are being realised (Claesson et al.
2011, 2012). Importantly, the microbiota in the elderly
was shown to be strongly influenced by diet, opening
up dietary-based intervention strategies in the elderly.
This has given rise to the view that healthy ageing is
associatedwithmicrobialdiversity(Biagietal.2010;Lynch
et al. 2015).
There has been much focus on the neurobiological
mechanisms underlying ageing. It is clear that neuro-
inflammatory processes play a key role in ageing, with
a growing emphasis on the role of the brain’s resident
immune cells, the microglia (Jyothi et al. 2015). More
recently, it has been shown that microglia activation is
under constant regulation by the gut microbiome (Erny
et al. 2015). These provocative findings suggest that it
is possible to manipulate neuroimmune responses by
targeting the gut microbiome. In particular, bacterial
metabolites, especially short chain fatty acids, are crucial
to these effects.
Another
consequence
of
ageing
and
age-related
disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease is the progressive
leakiness of the blood–brain barrier (BBB). In a very
provocative finding Braniste and colleagues have shown,
using a variety of techniques, that the integrity of the BBB
is dependent on appropriate microbiota composition in
the gut (Braniste et al. 2014). Once again short chain fatty
acids are key metabolites in mediating such effects.
It is clear that stress can have marked effects on
microbiota (Moloney et al. 2014) and the impact of
stress on the ageing brain can be particularly pernicious
(Prenderville et al. 2015). Both ageing and stress can
weaken gastrointestinal barrier function and drive a
proinflammatory phenotype via the microbiota (Kelly
et al. 2015). In addition both ageing and stress can
also negatively impact BBB permeability (Esposito et al.
2002; Montagne et al. 2015). The consequences of both
barriers being compromised has the potential to accelerate
‘inflamm-aging’ processes in the brain. Understanding
the mechanisms underlying how the microbiome can
influence such processes is now worthy of attention.
Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease and cognitive
impairment. Parkinson’s disease is generally a disorder
seenintheelderlyandcharacterisedbydegenerationofthe
dopaminergic nigro-striatal pathway, with a characteristic
pattern of abnormal movements. Studies indicate that
the enteric nervous system is frequently involved due
to the effects of α-synuclein (Miraglia et al. 2015). It is
well established that alteration in bowel function, mainly
in the form of constipation, can precede the onset of
prototypical motor symptoms. Svensson and colleagues
reviewed all Danish patients who underwent vagotomy
over the period of 1977–1995 and compared them with a
matched general population cohort (Svensson et al. 2015).
They explored the risk of developing Parkinson’s disease
following a full truncal vagotomy or a selective vagotomy.
TheriskofdevelopingParkinson’sdiseasewassignificantly
decreased in patients who underwent a full truncal
vagotomy compared to those who underwent a selective
vagotomy.Thelatterhadarisksimilartothatofthegeneral
population. These data offer the suggestion that the vagus
nerve may be critically involved in the pathogenesis of
the disorder. This is particularly important given the key
role of the vagus nerve in mediating microbiome-to-brain
signalling (Bravo et al. 2011). However, it is worth noting
that vagotomy also affects efferent vagal signalling, which
has important anti-inflammatory effects (Olofsson et al.
2012). Moreover, vagotomy also slows down gastro-
intestinal motor function that can lead to bacterial over-
growth (Grace et al. 2013), which also may complicate
interpretation of vagotomy experiments.
In the first study of its kind the gut microbiota has
recently been sequenced in patients with Parkinson’s
disease (Scheperjans et al. 2015). The microbiota of
72 patients and 72 matched controls were pyrosequenced.
There was a major reduction in the levels of Prevotellaceae

in the patients. There was a positive association between
the levels of Enterobacteriaceae and the severity of
postural instability and gait difficulty. The authors point
out that their study does not address either the temporal
or causal relationship between the gut microbiota and the
core features of the disease. Another analysis of micro-
biota composition in Parkinson’s disease (PD) pointed
to a reduction in butyrate-producing bacteria (Blautia,
Coprococcus and Roseburia) in faeces and Faecalibacterium
in the mucosa. This was coincident with an increase in
Ralstonia in mucosal samples more abundant in mucosa
of PD than controls (Keshavarzian et al. 2015). While
some have argued that microbiota transplantation might
benefit patients there is certainly no conclusive evidence
as yet. Neither are there any reports of controlled trials
of probiotics. It is clear that much more research is
needed to determine the relative role of the microbiome
in Parkinson’s disease (Dobbs et al. 2016; Felice et al.
2016).
Alzheimer’s disease and vascular dementias are the most
common causes of cognitive decline in ageing populations
in Western countries. The hippocampus plays a major
role in information processing and memory storage, with
long-term potentiation (LTP) – the physiological process
thought to underlie cognitive events in the hippocampus –
disrupted in animal models of Alzheimer’s disease (Lynch,
2004). Studies in rodents indicate that LTP begins to
decline in middle age but most dramatically in ageing
animals (Lynch, 2004).
VSL#3 is a widely studied probiotic mixture of eight
different gram-positive bacterial strains. When aged
animals were treated with this combination the micro-
biota showed a significant change, with increases in
Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes, both of which were
reduced in vehicle-treated animals (Distrutti et al.
2014). The age-related attenuation of LTP was decreased
in the VSL#3-treated animals. Furthermore, micro-
glial activation was decreased, the pivotal trophic
factor BDNF was increased, and a gene array found
alterationsintheexpressionofinflammationandneuronal
plasticity-related genes. More recently we have shown that
a bifidobacterium B. longum 1714 had a positive impact
on cognition in the mouse (Savignac et al. 2015). These
results are of interest but clearly require translation in
humans.
Surprisingly, a detailed analysis of the microbiota in
patients with Alzheimer’s disease is lacking (Alam et al.
2014). However, in type 2 diabetes (T2D), which is a risk
factor for Alzheimer’s disease, there is alteration in the gut
microbiota (Allin et al. 2015; He et al. 2015). This is seen
as an important feature of this condition, but whether
it is important in Alzheimer’s disease or not is an open
question.
More recently, preliminary data published in pre-
print format has implicated the microbiota in the
accumulation of amyloid plaques in a mouse model
of Alzheimer’s disease (Harach et al. 2015). In this
study the authors generated a transgenic Alzheimer’s
disease mouse model under germ-free conditions and
found a dramatic reduction of cerebral Aβ amyloid
pathology when compared to control Alzheimer’s disease
animals, which had a normal intestinal microbiota,
albeit one different to healthy, wild-type mice. Most
intriguingly, colonisation of germ-free Alzheimer’s disease
mice with microbiota harvested from conventionally
raised Alzheimer’s disease mice dramatically increased
cerebral Aβ pathology. Also in a similar vein, anti-
biotic treatment has been recently shown to limit Aβ
pathology and neuroinflammation (Minter et al. 2016).
Simultaneously,agrowingbodyofresearchisinvestigating
the microbial basis for triggering Aβ pathology (Kumar
et al. 2016). Together, these data offer hope for the
future generation of a novel microbiota-based approach
to ameliorate symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease.
Conclusions
Understanding the manner in which gut microbes
influencegut–brainaxiscommunicationhasbeenthesub-
ject of considerable research effort in recent times. It is
now generally accepted that the gut microbiota influences
psychological processes such as the stress response and
cognition (Dinan et al. 2015). Whether changes in the
microbiota are central to the pathophysiology of at least
some psychiatric disorders is unproven, though widely
speculated upon. Evidence is accumulating for a role for
the gut microbiota in autism and age-related disorders
such as Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s diseases. Future
work must investigate whether or not the exciting data
that have largely emerged from animal work can be
translated to humans, especially given the different diets
and microbiota composition between species. Moreover,
the exact mechanisms underlying the communication
between microbiome and brain need to be further
elucidated.
