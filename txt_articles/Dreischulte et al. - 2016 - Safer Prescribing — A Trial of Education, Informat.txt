BACKGROUND
High-risk prescribing and preventable drug-related complications are common in 
primary care. We evaluated whether the rates of high-risk prescribing by primary 
care clinicians and the related clinical outcomes would be reduced by a complex 
intervention.
METHODS
In this cluster-randomized, stepped-wedge trial conducted in Tayside, Scotland, we 
randomly assigned participating primary care practices to various start dates for a 
48-week intervention comprising professional education, informatics to facilitate re-
view, and financial incentives for practices to review patients’ charts to assess appro-
priateness. The primary outcome was patient-level exposure to any of nine measures 
of high-risk prescribing of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or selected 
antiplatelet agents (e.g., NSAID prescription in a patient with chronic kidney disease 
or coprescription of an NSAID and an oral anticoagulant without gastroprotection). 
Prespecified secondary outcomes included the incidence of related hospital admis-
sions. Analyses were performed according to the intention-to-treat principle, with the 
use of mixed-effect models to account for clustering in the data.
RESULTS
A total of 34 practices underwent randomization, 33 of which completed the study. 
Data were analyzed for 33,334 patients at risk at one or more points in the preinterven-
tion period and for 33,060 at risk at one or more points in the intervention period. 
Targeted high-risk prescribing was significantly reduced, from a rate of 3.7% (1102 of 
29,537 patients at risk) immediately before the intervention to 2.2% (674 of 30,187) at 
the end of the intervention (adjusted odds ratio, 0.63; 95% confidence interval [CI], 
0.57 to 0.68; P<0.001). The rate of hospital admissions for gastrointestinal ulcer or 
bleeding was significantly reduced from the preintervention period to the intervention 
period (from 55.7 to 37.0 admissions per 10,000 person-years; rate ratio, 0.66; 95% CI, 
0.51 to 0.86; P 
= 
0.002), as was the rate of admissions for heart failure (from 707.7 to 
513.5 admissions per 10,000 person-years; rate ratio, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.56 to 0.95; 
P 
= 
0.02), but admissions for acute kidney injury were not (101.9 and 86.0 admissions 
per 10,000 person-years, respectively; rate ratio, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.68 to 1.09; P 
= 
0.19).
CONCLUSIONS
A complex intervention combining professional education, informatics, and financial 
incentives reduced the rate of high-risk prescribing of antiplatelet medications and 
NSAIDs and may have improved clinical outcomes. (Funded by the Scottish Govern-
ment Chief Scientist Office; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01425502.)

H
igh-risk prescribing and prevent-
able drug-related complications in pri-
mary care are major concerns for health 
care systems internationally.1-7 Up to 4% of 
emergency hospital admissions are caused by 
preventable adverse drug events,8-10 and in the 
United States, the cost of avoidable drug-related 
hospital admissions, emergency department at-
tendances, and outpatient visits was estimated 
at $19.6 billion in 2013.11 The majority of drug-
related emergency admissions are caused by com-
monly prescribed drugs, with substantial contri-
butions from nonsteroidal antiinflammatory 
drugs (NSAIDs) and antiplatelet medications 
because of gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, and 
renal adverse drug events.4,5,7,8 Despite routine 
public reporting of a number of indicators of 
high-risk prescribing, variation among providers12 
and among Medicare hospital-referral regions13 
is large and reductions in high-risk prescribing 
are minimal or slow.14,15
Decisions about prescribing often involve bal-
ancing benefits and risks as well as the prefer-
ences of the patient, and high-risk prescribing is 
therefore sometimes appropriate, since benefits 
may be judged to outweigh the risk of harm to 
a person.12,16-19 Nevertheless, the observed high 
prevalence of and large variation in high-risk 
prescribing patterns are consistent with the 
hypothesis that the safety of prescribing in pri-
mary care can be improved,13-17 and at a mini-
mum, regular review to assess appropriateness 
is required.
However, persuading primary care practices 
to allocate scarce staff resources to improving 
the safety of prescribing is challenging, par-
ticularly when practices are independent, phy-
sician-owned small businesses that provide pri-
mary medical care under contract to an external 
payer, as is the case in many countries, includ-
ing in the United Kingdom, where this trial was 
performed.18 Therefore, the Data-Driven Quality 
Improvement in Primary Care (DQIP) program 
systematically developed a multifaceted inter-
vention for the improvement of prescribing 
safety in primary care practice.12,19-21 This inter-
vention comprised professional education about 
the risks of NSAIDs and antiplatelet medica-
tions, access to a Web-based tool to identify 
patients at the highest risk for adverse drug 
events related to NSAIDs and antiplatelet agents 
(aspirin or clopidogrel, as defined in Table S1 
in the Supplementary Appendix, available with 
the full text of this article at NEJM.org), and 
structured financial incentives to review these 
patients.
We developed and refined this intervention in 
four pilot practices in which participating physi-
cians judged that approximately 40% of the tar-
geted high-risk prescribing involving NSAIDs 
and antiplatelet agents required corrective ac-
tion.21 We evaluated the intervention in a cluster-
randomized trial that examined the effect of the 
intervention on high-risk prescribing of NSAIDs 
and antiplatelet medications and related emer-
gency hospital admissions.
Methods
Study Design
In brief, the DQIP trial was a pragmatic, cluster-
randomized trial that used a stepped-wedge de-
sign, in which all the participating practices re-
ceived the DQIP intervention but were randomly 
assigned to 1 of 10 designated start dates be-
tween October 30, 2011, and September 2, 2012. 
Each practice received the intervention for a 48-
week period, with continued data collection for 
48 weeks after the active intervention ceased. 
Figure S1 in the Supplementary Appendix shows 
the stepped-wedge design of the study. The 
methods of the study are described in detail in 
the Supplementary Appendix. The study was ap-
proved by the National Health Service (NHS) 
Scotland Fife and Forth Valley research ethics 
committee. The study was conducted and re-
ported with fidelity to the study protocol, which 
is available at NEJM.org. The authors vouch for 
the accuracy and completeness of the data pre-
sented.
Participants
Physician-owned practices with contracts to pro-
vide NHS primary medical care in the Tayside 
region of Scotland were eligible to participate if 
they used an electronic medical record (EMR) 
system that was compatible with data extraction 
to the DQIP informatics tool.19 In the United 
Kingdom, patients are registered with one pri-
mary care practice that is responsible for all 
prescription of drugs in the community, includ-
ing any prescribing that is initiated on the rec-
ommendation of a specialist. In each practice, 
patients were included at each data-measure-

ment point if they were alive, were permanently 
registered with the practice on that date, and 
had one or more risk factors that made them 
particularly vulnerable to adverse drug events 
related to NSAIDs or antiplatelet agents.
Intervention
The development and detailed design of the inter-
vention have been described in previous reports19-21 
and are summarized in the Supplementary Ap-
pendix. The intervention comprised three com-
ponents. First, practices received professional 
education, with each practice receiving a 1-hour 
educational outreach visit by a pharmacist at the 
start of the intervention (see Section 4 in the 
Supplementary Appendix for the presentation 
used), additional written material, and news-
letters (sent every 8 weeks) tailored to the prog-
ress of the practice.
Second, practices received financial incen-
tives in the form of an initial fixed payment of 
£350 ($600 U.S.) and a payment of £15 ($25 U.S.) 
for every patient for whom the targeted high-risk 
prescribing was reviewed during the intervention 
period (with only one claim allowed for each 
patient). The average expected payment per full-
time physician was approximately £550 ($910 U.S.), 
or approximately 0.6% of the average physician 
income.
Third, an informatics tool extracted data from 
the EMR system of each practice, identified in-
dividual patients who needed review, facilitated 
reviews of patients by graphically displaying 
relevant drug histories, and provided weekly 
updates on the rates of high-risk prescribing and 
progress in reviewing. Physicians accessed the 
tool by means of a password-protected Web-
based portal. Identified patients were flagged by 
the tool as needing review. Physicians could 
clear the flag by recording an explicit decision 
that the prescribing was appropriate, by stop-
ping prescription of the offending drugs, or by 
adding a gastroprotective drug (proton-pump 
inhibitor or histamine2-receptor antagonist) for 
measures targeting the risk of gastrointestinal 
bleeding.
Outcome Measures
The primary outcome measure was a composite 
of nine measures of high-risk prescribing of 
NSAIDs and antiplatelet agents in people with 
risk factors for adverse drug events related to 
these drugs (Table S1 in the Supplementary Ap-
pendix). The individual measures were related to 
three types of adverse drug events: gastrointesti-
nal events (six measures; e.g., aspirin or clopido-
grel prescription for a patient taking an oral 
anticoagulant without coprescription of a gas-
troprotective drug), renal events (two measures; 
e.g., NSAID prescription for a patient with 
chronic kidney disease), and heart failure (NSAID 
prescription for a patient with heart failure).20,22-27 
The composite primary outcome was defined as 
the percentage of patients with any risk factor 
(e.g., taking an anticoagulant, having chronic 
kidney disease, or having heart failure) who 
were currently receiving an antiplatelet agent, an 
NSAID, or both in a way that was defined as 
“high risk” by one or more individual measures. 
Prespecified secondary prescribing outcomes in-
cluded ongoing (prescribed within the previous 
year) and new (not prescribed within the previ-
ous year) high-risk prescribing and the rates of 
the nine prescribing outcome measures individ-
ually. In each practice, all prescribing indicators 
were measured every 8 weeks before and after 
the practice started the intervention, with the 
patients considered to be currently receiving a 
high-risk prescription if it had been issued at any 
point in the preceding 8 weeks.
Other prespecified secondary outcomes were 
emergency hospital admissions for gastrointesti-
nal bleeding, acute kidney injury, or heart fail-
ure; we considered admissions that were pre-
ceded by targeted high-risk prescribing as well 
as all such admissions in patients with risk fac-
tors for adverse drug events related to NSAIDs 
and antiplatelet agents, regardless of high-risk 
prescribing. We also conducted a post hoc 
analysis involving these same patients to exam-
ine changes in the rates of unrelated hospital 
admissions for hip fracture, cancer, and surgical 
emergencies (appendicitis, cholecystitis, or pan-
creatitis) and in the rates of unrelated ambula-
tory care sensitive admissions (defined as angi-
na, asthma, cellulitis, convulsions and epilepsy, 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, dehydra-
tion and gastroenteritis, dental conditions, dia-
betes complications, infection of the ear, nose, 
or throat, gangrene, hypertension, influenza and 
pneumonia, nutritional deficiency, other vaccine-
preventable disease, pelvic inflammatory disease, 
or pyelonephritis) (Table S2 in the Supplemen-
tary Appendix).28 All the outcomes were mea-

sured with the use of routine data that were ex-
tracted from practice EMRs (for prescribing) or 
from linked administrative data sets (for hospi-
tal admissions).
Randomization and Start-Date Concealment
Practices were assigned to 1 of 10 start dates by 
an independent statistician who was unaware of 
the identity of the practices, with randomization 
stratified by thirds of the number of registered 
patients. Concealment of the start-date assign-
ment from practices and from the research team 
was not possible, but prescribing measures were 
calculated at a remote site by the data provider 
independently of the research team before the 
data were transferred to the research team, with 
the use of the same algorithms that were used 
to provide feedback to practices.
Statistical Analysis
On the basis of data from the pilot practices19 and 
the Pharmacist-led Information Technology In-
tervention for Medication Errors (PINCER) trial,29 
we estimated that the study would have 83% 
power to detect a 25% reduction in the primary 
outcome, at an alpha level of 0.05, in 10 prac-
tices randomly assigned to 10 start dates.19,30 
We report the prespecified primary patient-level 
analysis, as well as a secondary practice-level 
analysis (see the Supplementary Appendix).
The analyses were performed according to 
the intention-to-treat principle; we analyzed data 
from all the eligible patients regardless of 
whether they actually received a review. Multi-
level logistic regression was used to estimate odds 
ratios and 95% confidence intervals for exposure 
to high-risk prescribing across data points dur-
ing the intervention period as compared with 
the preintervention period (Fig. S1 in the Supple-
mentary Appendix), with adjustment for cluster-
ing within practices and over time. In prespeci-
fied analyses of hospital admissions, we summed 
events across all the practices during the pre-
intervention period and the intervention period 
and calculated rates by dividing the sums by the 
total person-time during which patients had risk 
factors for adverse drug events related to NSAIDs 
and antiplatelet agents. The incidence in the in-
tervention period versus the preintervention pe-
riod was compared with the use of the condi-
tional maximum-likelihood estimate of the rate 
ratio.31
Finally, in a post hoc analysis, we examined 
whether the effect of the DQIP intervention was 
sustained after the end of the intervention. We 
compared the rate of high-risk prescribing in the 
last 24 weeks of the intervention period with 
that in the last 24 weeks of the postintervention 
period using the same model as that used for the 
primary outcome (Fig. S1 in the Supplementary 
Appendix).
Results
Participating Practices
Of 66 Tayside practices we approached, 34 (52%) 
agreed to participate, but 1 withdrew before its 
randomized start date. The intervention was 
therefore implemented in 33 practices, with a 
pooled list size of 202,262 patients on the date 
that the practices started the intervention. A total 
of 33,334 patients with risk factors for adverse 
drug events related to NSAIDs and antiplatelet 
agents were included in the analysis at one or 
more time points during the preintervention 
period, and 33,060 patients were included in the 
intervention period (Fig. S2 in the Supplemen-
tary Appendix). There was a significant but 
clinically small rising trend in the rate of high-
risk prescribing during the preintervention period 
(mean absolute increase, 0.07 percentage points 
for every 8 weeks elapsed; 95% confidence inter-
val [CI], 0.02 to 0.12).
Preintervention Data
Table 1 shows the preintervention characteristics 
of the participating practices according to their 
randomly assigned start date. The numbers of 
patients with risk factors for adverse drug events 
related to NSAIDs and antiplatelet agents at the 
start of the intervention ranged from 1894 to 
4857 patients across the 10 randomly assigned 
start dates, with 2.0 to 4.6% of the patients hav-
ing prescriptions for a high-risk NSAID, an anti-
platelet medication, or both at the start of the 
intervention. Although there were significant dif-
ferences in the mean age and sex of the patients 
across start dates, absolute differences were 
small (range of mean age, 72 to 76 years; range 
of percentage of men, 45 to 48%). There were no 
significant differences in mean practice-list sizes 
and quality of care as measured by performance 
on the U.K. Quality and Outcomes Framework,32 
but the percentages of patients living in the most

Plus–minus values are means ±SD. The 33 participating practices were divided into 10 study groups, according to the randomized start date of the intervention. The randomized start 
dates all occurred between October 30, 2011, and September 2, 2012, with 1 indicating the earliest group to start and 10 the latest. There were significant between-group differences in 
the following characteristics: patients who had high-risk prescribing in the previous 8 weeks, age of the patients, sex, and patients living in most socioeconomically deprived quintile of 
Scottish postal codes (all P<0.001). Analyses were performed with the use of one-way analysis of variance for means and the chi-square test for proportions. The proportions of training 
and urban practices in each group were not formally compared owing to small numbers.

cantly (range, 0.4 to 38.3%).
Reviews Conducted by Practices
During the intervention period, 2905 patients 
with risk factors received at least one high-risk 
prescription. Approximately half of all patients 
who needed review during the 48-week interven-
tion period were flagged for review at the first 
log-in. The remaining patients were flagged 
later during the intervention period; these pa-
tients had a mixture of prior intermittent use 
and true new use of high-risk prescriptions. Of 
these patients, 1598 (55.0%) underwent a total 
of 1858 reviews. At review, follow-up was judged 
to be required for 1296 of these cases (69.8%). 
Follow-up involved contacting patients to discuss 
appropriateness (515 patients [27.7% of all re-
views]), planning discussion at future routine 
contact (409 [22.0%]), changing prescriptions 
and informing the patient by letter (163 [8.8%]), 
or other actions (209 [11.2%]).
Prescribing Outcomes
Figure 1 shows trends in the primary outcome 
of high-risk prescribing, relative to the interven-
tion start date in each practice (data for the 10 
individual groups, according to the randomly 
assigned start dates, are shown in Figs. S3 and 
S4 in the Supplementary Appendix). In the

Data are the total number of patients across practices, at the start and end of the intervention period in each practice, who had risk factors for high-risk prescribing and who received a 
high-risk prescription in the previous 8 weeks.
‡  
Multilevel adjusted odds ratios account for the clustering of patients within practices and the repeated measurement within patients over time. Under the stepped-wedge design, the 
adjusted odds ratios are calculated with the use of all data points in the intervention period versus the preintervention period and so represent the average odds of exposure to high-risk 
prescribing over the entire intervention period versus the preintervention period.
§  
The intracluster correlation coefficient is the proportion of variation in outcome that is due to variation between practices.
¶  
Ongoing high-risk prescribing was defined as the patient receiving a high-risk prescription during the measurement period and having been prescribed the same drug during the previ-
ous 48 weeks. New high-risk prescribing was defined as the patient receiving a high-risk prescription and not having had it during the previous 48 weeks.

analysis of the primary outcome, 674 of 30,187 
patients (2.2%) with risk factors for related ad-
verse drug events had prescriptions for NSAIDs, 
antiplatelet agents, or both at the end of the in-
tervention, as compared with 1102 of 29,537 
(3.7%) who had prescriptions immediately be-
fore the intervention (adjusted odds ratio, 0.63; 
95% CI, 0.57 to 0.68; P<0.001).
There were significant reductions in the rates 
of ongoing high-risk prescribing (from 2.6% im-
mediately before the intervention to 1.5% at the 
end of the intervention; adjusted odds ratio, 
0.60; 95% CI, 0.53 to 0.67; P<0.001) and new 
high-risk prescribing (from 1.1% to 0.7%; ad-
justed odds ratio, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.68 to 0.87; 
P<0.001). There were significant reductions in 
eight of the nine individual measures of high-
risk prescribing (range of adjusted odds ratios, 
0.27 to 0.78), but there was no significant reduc-
tion in the rate of NSAID prescribing for people 
with heart failure (Table 2).
Reductions in the rates of high-risk prescrib-
ing were sustained after financial incentives 
ceased. In an analysis of the primary outcome, 
674 of 30,187 patients (2.2%) with risk factors 
for related adverse drug events had prescriptions 
for NSAIDs, antiplatelet agents, or both at the 
end of the intervention, and 560 of 28,616 (2.0%) 
had such prescriptions at 48 weeks after incen-
tives ceased (adjusted odds ratio, 1.14; 95% CI, 
0.85 to 1.53; P 
= 
0.38).
Hospital Admission Outcomes
Table 3 shows that among patients with risk fac-
tors for adverse drug events related to NSAIDs 
and antiplatelet agents, the incidence of admis-
sions preceded by a high-risk prescription (re-
ceived in the previous 8 weeks) was significantly 
reduced from the preintervention period to the 
intervention period; admissions for gastrointes-
tinal bleeding were reduced from 4.6 per 10,000 
person-years to 0.4 per 10,000 person-years (rate 
ratio, 0.09; 95% CI, 0.00 to 0.52), and admis-
sions for acute kidney injury were reduced from 
34.6 per 10,000 person-years to 11.1 per 10,000 
person-years (rate ratio, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.17 to 
0.58). The incidence of admissions for heart fail-
ure that were preceded by an NSAID prescription 
was not significantly reduced from the preinter-
vention period to the intervention period (59.0 
and 32.1 admissions per 10,000 person-years, re-
spectively; rate ratio, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.20 to 1.51).

Data are the number of outcome events over the preintervention and intervention periods, during which patients had risk factors for high-risk prescribing. The analyses of potentially 
drug-related hospital admission with relevant high-risk prescribing in the 8 weeks before admission and potentially drug-related hospital admission regardless of preceding high-risk 
prescribing were prespecified. The analysis of hospital admission that was considered by the investigators to be unrelated to the specified high-risk prescribing patterns targeted by the 
intervention was post hoc.
†  
The differences in person-time are due to longer preintervention periods in practices randomly assigned to later start dates under the stepped-wedge design.

Ambulatory care–sensitive admissions were as defined by Purdy et al.28 for hospital admissions data in the United Kingdom, but admissions for heart failure, perforated peptic ulcer or 
bleeding, and iron-deficiency anemia were excluded because the investigators considered them to be potentially related to the targeted prescribing. Ambulatory care–sensitive condi-
tions included were angina, asthma, cellulitis, convulsions and epilepsy, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, dehydration and gastroenteritis, dental conditions, diabetes complica-
tions, infection of the ear, nose, or throat, gangrene, hypertension, influenza and pneumonia, nutritional deficiency, other vaccine-preventable disease, pelvic inflammatory disease, and

The new engl and jour nal of medicine
Among patients with risk factors for adverse 
drug events related to NSAIDs and antiplatelet 
agents, regardless of preceding high-risk pre-
scribing, the incidence of total hospital admis-
sions for gastrointestinal ulcer or bleeding was 
significantly reduced (from 55.7 to 37.0 admis-
sions per 10,000 person-years; rate ratio, 0.66; 
95% CI, 0.51 to 0.86), as was the incidence of 
heart failure (from 707.7 to 513.5 admissions per 
10,000 person-years; rate ratio, 0.73; 95% CI, 
0.56 to 0.95). The incidence of total admissions 
for acute kidney injury was not significantly re-
duced from the preintervention period to the 
intervention period (101.9 and 86.0 admissions 
per 10,000 person-years, respectively; rate ratio, 
0.84; 95% CI, 0.68 to 1.09).
Among patients with risk factors for adverse 
drug events related to NSAIDs and antiplatelet 
agents, there was no significant change between 
the preintervention period and the intervention 
period in the incidence of admissions for hip 
fracture (120.8 and 135.2 admissions per 10,000 
person-years, respectively; rate ratio, 1.12; 95% 
CI, 0.98 to 1.28), cancer (183.4 and 185.1 admis-
sions per 10,000 person-years; rate ratio, 1.01; 
95% CI, 0.90 to 1.13), or appendicitis, cholecys-
titis, or pancreatitis (14.0 and 13.6 admissions 
per 10,000 person-years; rate ratio, 0.97; 95% CI, 
0.64 to 1.47), or in the incidence of unrelated 
ambulatory care sensitive admissions (500.2 and 
511.5 admissions per 10,000 person-years; rate 
ratio, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.95 to 1.10).
Discussion
We found that a complex intervention that com-
bined professional education, informatics to 
identify high-risk patients, and financial incen-
tives to primary care clinicians significantly re-
duced the rate of high-risk prescribing of NSAIDs 
and antiplatelet medications, which is a common 
cause of drug-related emergency hospital admis-
sions internationally.4,5,7,8 The effect on ongoing 
high-risk prescribing was somewhat larger than 
the effect on new high-risk prescribing — a 
finding that was consistent with the fact that the 
intervention prompted review of patients who 
were already exposed to high-risk prescribing 
— although both rates fell significantly, and a 
lower rate of initiation of prescribing contribut-
ed to the sustained effect in the year after finan-
cial incentives ceased. There was evidence that 
the intervention led to reductions in the rates of 
related emergency hospital admissions, with no 
change observed in the rate of unrelated admis-
sions.
The strengths of the study include the careful 
intervention design,12,19-21 evaluation in routine 
primary care practice, and examination of sus-
tainability after financial incentives ceased. The 
study also has some important limitations. First, 
although half the eligible practices took part, 
participating practices may have been more 
motivated or had greater capacity to change than 
nonparticipating practices. Second, the stepped-
wedge design can be vulnerable to secular trends 
if outcomes are already improving.30 The rate of 
targeted high-risk prescribing was rising slowly 
during the preintervention period and there were 
no other relevant nontrial interventions during 
the period of implementation, which indicates 
that secular trends are unlikely to have affected 
the prescribing outcomes. However, we were un-
able to reliably examine prior time trends for the 
hospital admission outcomes examined, since 
they are relatively rare events, but the rates of 
four different types of unrelated admission did 
not fall significantly, which increases confidence 
in the observed findings.
It should be noted that the reductions in the 
total rates of admissions due to gastrointestinal 
bleeding and heart failure were larger than can 
be explained by reductions in the rates of such 
admissions that were actually preceded by the 
targeted high-risk prescribing. A recent study of 
a large pay-for-performance program in primary 
care that was conducted in the United Kingdom 
also showed larger reductions in the rates of 
emergency admission than could be explained 
by changes in targeted process measures.33 Al-
though such halo effects are conceivable (e.g., 
owing to safer use of other medicines that cause 
the same adverse effects or recommendations to 
patients to avoid over-the-counter NSAIDs and 
aspirin), confirmation in larger studies that are 
powered to robustly examine hospital admission 
outcomes is required.
Finally, although it is likely that this interven-
tion would be effective for similar prescribing 
decisions (those based on an assessment of 
benefit and harm to the individual patient), com-
mon adverse drug events that are associated with 
other mechanisms will require different ap-
proaches. For example, reducing warfarin-related

harm is likely to require improvements in the 
reliability of monitoring and patient education.
This trial showed that a blend of education, 
financial incentives to review high-risk patients, 
and informatics to support review was effective, 
but we cannot identify which aspect of the inter-
vention mattered most. Financial incentives to 
stop high-risk prescribing are potentially prob-
lematic because there may be a risk of inappro-
priate cessation to obtain payment in a subgroup 
of patients in whom the balance of benefit and 
harm favors continuation of the drug. We there-
fore chose to provide incentives to review. Since 
this approach could lead to “tick-box review” 
simply to obtain payment, we sought to ensure 
the delivery of meaningful review through the use 
of education and informatics, because an under-
standing of risk and an awareness that current 
practice is suboptimal are likely to be prerequi-
sites for changing prescribing behavior, and there 
was good evidence from previous studies that 
both educational outreach visits and audit and 
feedback practices can lead to small improve-
ments in prescribing.34,35
Feedback was one element of the informatics; 
the other was a reduction in barriers to efficient 
structured review. Education and minimization 
of the barriers to change were also elements in 
the successful PINCER intervention (based in the 
United Kingdom), in which external pharmacists 
reviewed patients who were exposed to high-risk 
prescribing and worked with primary care physi-
cians to implement change. The PINCER trial 
showed reductions in the rates of high-risk pre-
scribing that were similar to those observed 
with the DQIP intervention at 6 months, but the 
effect of pharmacist-led review partly waned by 
12 months.29 In contrast, the DQIP intervention 
had a sustained effect over the year after the fi-
nancial incentives ceased, which is important to 
allow the focus of quality-improvement activity 
to move to other areas of care.
The three components of this intervention are 
feasible in any system in which primary care is 
delivered by physician-owned practices that use 
EMRs and are under contract with third-party 
payers, which is a common model internation-
ally. However, complex interventions of this type 
inevitably require tailoring to context. For exam-
ple, the size of the incentives that are required 
to prompt review is likely to vary according to 
primary care physician payment structures and 
incomes. Similarly, in some contexts, it may be 
easier to embed the informatics functionality 
directly in the EMR (e.g., if all targeted providers 
use one EMR system and the EMR supplier is 
willing to cooperate). Although we think that it 
is likely that interventions that blend education, 
incentives to review, and informatics will be ef-
fective in other health care systems, any imple-
mentation should be tailored to context and 
evaluated for effect.
In conclusion, we found that a complex inter-
vention that combined professional education, 
informatics to support patient identification and 
review, and financial incentives to review patients 
who have been exposed to high-risk prescribing 
led to substantial and sustained reductions in 
targeted high-risk prescribing and was associ-
ated with reductions in the rates of related emer-
gency admissions.
