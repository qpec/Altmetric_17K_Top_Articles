Background
Pneumonia is a common and potentially serious illness. Corticosteroids have been suggested for the treatment of different types of
infection, however their role in the treatment of pneumonia remains unclear. This is an update of a review published in 2011.
Objectives
To assess the efficacy and safety of corticosteroids in the treatment of pneumonia.
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group’s Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and LILACS
on 3 March 2017, together with relevant conference proceedings and references of identified trials. We also searched three trials registers
for ongoing and unpublished trials.
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that assessed systemic corticosteroid therapy, given as adjunct to antibiotic treatment,
versus placebo or no corticosteroids for adults and children with pneumonia.
Data collection and analysis
We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Two review authors independently assessed risk of bias and
extracted data. We contacted study authors for additional information. We estimated risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals
(CI) and pooled data using the Mantel-Haenszel fixed-effect model when possible.
Main results
We included 17 RCTs comprising a total of 2264 participants; 13 RCTs included 1954 adult participants, and four RCTs included
310 children. This update included 12 new studies, excluded one previously included study, and excluded five new trials. One trial
awaits classification.
All trials limited inclusion to inpatients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), with or without healthcare-associated pneumonia
(HCAP). We assessed the risk of selection bias and attrition bias as low or unclear overall. We assessed performance bias risk as low
for nine trials, unclear for one trial, and high for seven trials. We assessed reporting bias risk as low for three trials and high for the
remaining 14 trials.

Corticosteroids for pneumonia (Review)
Copyright © 2017 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
 Corticosteroids significantly reduced mortality in adults with severe pneumonia (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.84; moderate-quality
evidence), but not in adults with non-severe pneumonia (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.45 to 2.00). Early clinical failure rates (defined as death
from any cause, radiographic progression, or clinical instability at day 5 to 8) were significantly reduced with corticosteroids in people
with severe and non-severe pneumonia (RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.7; and RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.56 to 0.83, respectively; high-quality
evidence). Corstocosteroids reduced time to clinical cure, length of hospital and intensive care unit stays, development of respiratory
failure or shock not present at pneumonia onset, and rates of pneumonia complications.
Among children with bacterial pneumonia, corticosteroids reduced early clinical failure rates (defined as for adults, RR 0.41, 95% CI
0.24 to 0.70; high-quality evidence) based on two small, clinically heterogeneous trials, and reduced time to clinical cure.
Hyperglycaemia was significantly more common in adults treated with corticosteroids (RR 1.72, 95% CI 1.38 to 2.14). There were
no significant differences between corticosteroid-treated people and controls for other adverse events or secondary infections (RR 1.19,
95% CI 0.73 to 1.93).
Authors’ conclusions
Corticosteroid therapy reduced mortality and morbidity in adults with severe CAP; the number needed to treat for an additional
beneficial outcome was 18 patients (95% CI 12 to 49) to prevent one death. Corticosteroid therapy reduced morbidity, but not
mortality, for adults and children with non-severe CAP
. Corticosteroid therapy was associated with more adverse events, especially
hyperglycaemia, but the harms did not seem to outweigh the benefits.
P L A I N
L A N G U A G E
S U M M A R Y
Is treatment with corticosteroids beneficial and safe for people with pneumonia?
Review question
We looked at the effects of treating people with pneumonia using corticosteroids (also called steroids or glucocorticoids) on numbers
of deaths, response to treatment, treatment complications, and side effects. We compared treatment with corticosteroids in addition to
antibiotics with placebo or no treatment.
Background
Acute pneumonia is a lung infection treated with antibiotics that target the bacteria that caused the infection. Pneumonia is quite
common, and despite adequate antibiotic treatment, complications and sometimes death can occur.
Corticosteroids are hormones produced naturally in the adrenal gland. Corticosteroids have been found to be beneficial in the treatment
of some infections. However, their beneficial effects are often offset by serious side effects, mainly when used at high doses and over
the long term. This is an update of a review published in 2011.
Search date
The evidence is current to 3 March 2017.
Study characteristics
We included 17 studies evaluating systemic corticosteroid therapy (given intravenously or by tablets) for people with pneumonia (2264
participants; 1954 adults and 310 children). We included 12 new studies in this update and excluded one previously included study.
All included studies evaluated people who had acquired pneumonia in the community (community-acquired pneumonia (CAP)) being
treated in the hospital; no studies assessed people who had developed pneumonia while in hospital or who were on breathing machines
(mechanically ventilated).
Study funding sources
Eight trials did not report funding sources; seven were funded by academic sponsors; one was funded by a pharmaceutical company;
and one reported receiving no funding.
Key results
Corticosteroids reduced deaths in adults with severe CAP
, but not in people with non-severe CAP
. Eighteen adults with severe CAP
need to be treated with corticosteroids to prevent one death.

Corticosteroids for pneumonia (Review)
Copyright © 2017 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
 People with CAP treated with corticosteroids had lower clinical failure rates (death, worsening of imaging studies, or no clinical
improvement),shortertime tocure, ashorterhospital stay, andfewercomplications.We foundgood-qualityevidence that corticosteroids
reduced clinical failure rates in children with pneumonia, but the data were based on a small number of children with different types
of pneumonia.
People treated with corticosteroids had higher blood glucose levels (hyperglycaemia) than those not treated with corticosteroids.
Corticosteroid treatment was not associated with increased rates of other serious adverse events.
Corticosteroids were beneficial for adults with severe CAP
. People with non-severe CAP may also benefit from corticosteroid therapy,
but with no survival advantage.
Quality of the evidence
We downgraded the quality of the evidence due to issues with study design, unclear results, or results that were not similar across
studies. For the outcomes of death and clinical failure in adults, we graded the quality of the evidence as moderate. For the outcomes
of clinical failure in people with severe CAP
, non-severe CAP
, and in children, we graded the quality of the evidence as high.

GRADE Working Group grades of evidence
High quality: We are very confident that the true effect lies close to that of the estimate of the effect.
Moderate quality: We are moderately confident in the effect estimate: the true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of the effect, but there is a possibility that it is
substantially different.
Low quality: Our confidence in the effect estimate is limited: the true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of the effect.
Very low quality: We have very little confidence in the effect estimate: the true effect is likely to be substantially different from the estimate of the effect
1Some trials had unclear allocation concealment, which seemed to exaggerate the effect of corticosteroids.
2We downgraded quality for imprecision because the 95% CIs overlap no effect and the RR ranged from -55% to 100%.
3We downgraded quality for inconsistency (I² = 89.3% for this outcome).
4Some trials had unclear allocation concealment, however we did not downgrade quality because the effect of intervention
remained significant in trials with low and unclear allocation concealment.
5We downgraded quality for inconsistency (I² = 74% for this outcome) and upgraded one level for large effect (RR = 0.32).

Description of the condition
Acute pneumonia is a common and potentially serious illness. De-
spite significant advances in its aetiological investigation, antimi-
crobial therapy, and improvements in supportive care, acute pneu-
monia is still among the top 10 most common causes of death
among all age groups. In the USA in 2013, pneumonia was the
sixth-leading cause of death in people aged 65 years and over, and
the single most common cause of infection-related mortality (Xu
2016).
In the past, acute pneumonia was classified as community-
acquired pneumonia (CAP) and hospital-acquired pneumonia
(HAP) including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), based
on differences in aetiologic agents and antibiotic susceptibilities
among these entities. Following increases in healthcare delivery
shifting to outpatient settings, an additional pneumonia cate-
gory, healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP), has been defined.
Healthcare-associated pneumonia occurs in non-hospitalised peo-
ple whohave hadextensive healthcare contact,definedasincluding
one or more of: intravenous therapy, wound care, or intravenous
chemotherapy over the previous 30 days; residing in a nursing
home or other long-term care facility; hospitalisation in an acute
care hospital for two or more days over the previous 90 days; or
attending a hospital or haemodialysis clinic over the previous 30
days (Friedman 2002).
The aetiology of CAP varies by geographic region. However, Strep-
tococcus pneumoniae is the most common cause worldwide (File
2010). The overall incidence of CAP in adults is approximately
5.16 to 6.11 cases per 1000 persons per year and increases with
age. There is seasonal variation, with more cases of pneumonia oc-
curring during the winter months. About 20% of all people with
CAP are admitted to hospital (Niederman 2007), and approxi-
mately 10% to 20% of patients require admission to intensive care
units (ICU) (Marrie 2007; Restrepo 2008). Thirty-day mortality
in people who are hospitalised for CAP is approximately 10% to
12% and is higher in people admitted to the ICU (Musher 2014).
HAP
, VAP
, and HCAP may be caused by a broad variety of
pathogens and can be polymicrobial. Common pathogens include
aerobic gram-negative bacilli and gram-positive cocci (e.g. Staphy-
lococcus aureus, including methicillin-resistant S aureus (MRSA)
and Streptococcus spp). Hospital-acquired pneumonia due to
viruses or fungi is significantly less common, except in people who
are immunocompromised (Jones 2010).
Precise incidence rates of HAP and HCAP are difficult to deter-
mine because of differences in local epidemiology and infection
control measures. Estimates of HAP incidence range from 5 to
more than 20 episodes per 1000 hospitalisations (Chawla 2008),
accounting for up to 25% of all nosocomial (hospital-acquired)
infections (Magill 2014; Torres 2010). Hospital-acquired pneu-
monia is the leading cause of death among hospital-acquired in-
fections, with estimates of HAP-associated mortality ranging from
20% to 50% (Chawla 2008; Rosenthal 2012). The rate of VAP
development is between 10% and 30% of patients receiving more
than 48 hours of mechanical ventilation (Rosenthal 2012; Torres
2010). The occurrence of VAP has a significant impact on patient
outcomes; it is associated with substantial morbidity, significantly
longer ICU stays, and a two-fold mortality rate compared with
similar patients who do not have VAP (Safdar 2005).
Description of the intervention
Corticosteroids (glucocorticoids, steroids) include steroid hor-
mones that are naturally produced in the adrenal cortex of ver-
tebrates and their synthetic analogues. Corticosteroids are in-
volved in many physiological processes, including stress response,
immune response and regulation of inflammation, carbohydrate
metabolism, protein catabolism, blood electrolyte levels and be-
haviour. Synthetic derivatives of natural steroids include pred-
nisone, prednisolone, methylprednisolone, betamethasone, dex-
amethasone, triamcinolone, and hydrocortisone. Corticosteroids
are important components in the treatment of many inflamma-
tory, allergic, immunologic, and malignant disorders. Corticos-
teroids are administered by inhalation, orally, or intravenously
(Rhen 2005).
Unfortunately, the therapeutic effects of corticosteroids are often
accompanied by clinically significant side effects, most of which
are related to the dose and duration of therapy (Rhen 2005). Many
adverse effects occur only with prolonged administration; most
short-term adverse events are reversible when the drug is discon-
tinued. Side effects observed with long-term, high-dose treatment
include obesity with a special fat distribution pattern (e.g. face
swelling), immune depression, delayed wound healing, growth
retardation in children, hirsutism, diabetes, depressive disorders,
Cushing’s syndrome, and osteoporosis (Oray 2016). Short-term
use of corticosteroids may be associated with hyperglycaemia, fluid
retention, andhypertension, which are typicallytransient(Schäcke
2002). Neuropsychiatric side effects, ranging from insomnia and
irritability to mania, psychosis, and delirium, are commonly seen
with short-term corticosteroid use (Warrington 2006).
How the intervention might work
Corticosteroids have been suggested for the treatment of different
types of infections, including meningitis, tuberculosis, pneumo-
cystis pneumonia, other bacterial pneumonia, and septic shock.
The theoretical advantages of corticosteroids differ for each infec-
tion type (Chalmers 2010; Kalil 2016; Salluh 2008).
In septic shock, a condition of extreme physiological stress, sub-
optimal cortisol production has been termed critical illness-re-
lated corticosteroid insufficiency (CIRCI) (Marik 2008). The ma-
jor theoretical purpose of corticosteroids in sepsis is to restore bal-

 ance to the altered hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (Annane
2004; Mandell 2015). People with pneumonia might present with
CIRCI, requiring corticosteroid support. In addition, corticos-
teroids might have a local effect at the site of infection in pneumo-
nia. In pulmonary infections, the release of cytokines and other in-
flammatory mediators from alveolar macrophages serves as a use-
ful mechanism to eliminate invading pathogens. However, exces-
sive release can potentially be harmful to the lung and the host.
Corticosteroids might reduce pulmonary inflammation in severe
pneumonia, preventing respiratory failure (Mandell 2015). Sev-
eral in vitro studies have demonstrated that corticosteroids de-
crease cytokine expression in human cells and inhibit migration
of phagocytic cells (Rhen 2005). It has been shown that corticos-
teroids also diminish the release of cytokines (mainly interleukin-
6 (IL-6) in serum and broncho-alveolar lavage) in vivo, and that
C-reactive protein (an acute-phase protein related to IL-6) and
neutrophil counts in broncho-alveolar aspirates were decreased in
people receiving corticosteroids. Possible explanations for the lat-
ter include the effect of corticosteroids on neutrophil migration or
accelerated neutrophil apoptosis in a cytokine-depleted milieu, or
both (Montón 1999). Another potential benefit of corticosteroids
in pneumonia is by blocking a Jarisch-Herxheimer-like reaction
to initiation of antibiotics in patients with high bacterial load.
The Jarisch-Herxheimer-like reaction is thought to be due to high
concentrations of cytokines shortly after initiation of antibiotics,
possibly through release of endotoxin or other bacterial mediators
in people with a high bacterial burden (Wunderink 2015). This is
the probable mechanism underlying the benefit of corticosteroids
in meningococcal meningitis (Brouwer 2015).
The possible benefits of corticosteroid therapy must be balanced
against their potential adverse effects. Hyperglycaemia is known to
be associated with poor clinical outcomes in critically ill patients.
Several trials have shown that hyperglycaemic critically ill patients
have highermortalityratesthanthose whoare normoglycaemic, al-
though a causal relationship has not been proved (Krinsley 2003).
Fluid retention as an adverse effect of corticosteroid therapy with
resulting pulmonary congestion may also have deleterious effects
in people with pneumonia, especially those with severe pneumo-
nia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Other com-
mon adverse effects of short-term corticosteroid therapy may be
more relevant to milder cases of pneumonia, for example devel-
opment of delirium may result in prolongation of hospital stay,
and insomnia might affect patients’ quality of life. Systemic gluco-
corticoid therapy is associated with a dose-dependent increase in
the risk of infection, especially with common bacterial, viral, and
fungal pathogens. Specifically, in high-dose glucocorticoid therapy
there is an immediate risk of infection due to inhibitory effects on
phagocytic cell function. Most clinical trials evaluating the role of
corticosteroids in pneumonia used short courses of relatively low-
dose corticosteroids, which are not expected to pose a significant
infection risk.
Why it is important to do this review
In clinical practice, use of corticosteroids for people with pneu-
monia remains variable. Current guidelines do not address cor-
ticosteroids in the standard management of people with CAP
,
HAP
, HCAP
, or VAP (Kalil 2016; Mandell 2007). An exception
is the British guidelines, which state that “... steroids are not rec-
ommended in the routine treatment of high severity CAP” (Lim
2009).
The 2011 version of this Cochrane Review showed that corti-
costeroids were beneficial for accelerating the time to resolution
of symptoms with no effect on mortality for most people with
pneumonia (Chen 2011). Since then, several relatively large ran-
domised controlled trials assessing the role of corticosteroids for
people with pneumonia have been published. Combining data
from all relevant trials may lead to more definitive conclusions,
particularly whether the effects of corticosteroids could be patient-
specific. Compiling all existing studies might allow for the assess-
ment of corticosteroid effects for specific patient subgroups with
pneumonia. For this update we revised the protocol, inclusion
criteria, and analyses and re-extracted all data. We have reported
deviations from the original review, Chen 2011, in the Differences
between protocol and review section of this update.

To assess the efficacy and safety of corticosteroids in the treatment
of pneumonia. In particular, we aimed to answer whether systemic
steroid treatment:
1. reduces all-cause mortality among people with pneumonia;
2. reduces morbidity among people with pneumonia;
3. increases complication rates among people with
pneumonia.

Criteria for considering studies for this review
Types of studies
Randomised controlled trials assessing the effectiveness of corti-
costeroids for pneumonia were eligible for inclusion.

Corticosteroids for pneumonia (Review)
Copyright © 2017 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
 Types of participants
Adults or children with radiographically confirmed pneumo-
nia, including community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) treated in
the community, hospitals, or intensive care unit (ICU); health-
care-associated pneumonia (HCAP); hospital-acquired pneumo-
nia (HAP); and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
We excluded studies including only neonates, people with Pneu-
mocystis pneumonia, and people with HIV.
Types of interventions
Systemic corticosteroid treatment, given as adjunct to antibiotic
treatment versus antibiotics alone or antibiotics with placebo.
Corticosteroids may have been given at any dose, mode, and for
any duration. We included the following corticosteroids: pred-
nisone, prednisolone, methylprednisolone, betamethasone, dex-
amethasone, triamcinolone, and hydrocortisone.
Types of outcome measures
Primary outcomes
1. All-cause mortality within 30 days after randomisation. If
not reported at day 30, we extracted the outcome closest to 30
days.
Secondary outcomes
1. Early clinical failure (clinical failure at 5 to 7 days), defined
as death from any cause, radiographic progression, or clinical
instability, as defined in the study. We accepted the study
definitions and assessed their compatibility with the outcome
suggested by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA),
that is at least one of the following: temperature higher than 37.8
°C, heart rate higher than 100 beats per minute, respiratory rate
higher than 24 breaths per minute, systolic blood pressure lower
than 90 mm Hg or need for vasopressor support, altered mental
status, inability for oral intake, or inadequate oxygenation at
room temperature (PaO
< 60 mm Hg or pulse oximetry <
90%) (Mandell 2007).
2. Time to clinical cure, defined at least by no fever,
haemodynamic stability, and return to baseline respiratory
condition. We accepted the study definitions for clinical cure,
recorded them, and assessed their compatibility with the IDSA
outcome definitions.
3. Development of respiratory failure not present initially,
defined as need for non-invasive or invasive mechanical
ventilation that was not present at onset of pneumonia.
4. Development of shock not present initially.
5. Transfer to ICU among participants not admitted initially
to the ICU.
6. Duration of hospital stay for hospitalised participants.
7. Duration of ICU stay for participants admitted to the ICU.
8. Pneumonia complications not present initially, including
empyema, lung abscess, pneumothorax (as defined in study).
9. Secondary infections, including any superinfection
diagnosed ≥ 72 hours from randomisation.
10. Adverse events:
◦ any adverse event;
◦ hyperglycaemia, preferably defined as new need for
insulin treatment;
◦ neuropsychiatric events, including delirium;
◦ gastrointestinal bleeding; and
◦ adverse cardiac events, including arrhythmia,
congestive heart failure exacerbation, or acute coronary event.
Search methods for identification of studies
Electronic searches
The previous version of this review included trials identified from
searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials
(CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, the China National Knowl-
edge Infrastructure (CNKI) and VIP databases up to 2010 (Chen
2011).
For this update, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of
Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2017, Issue 2) which includes
the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group’s Specialised
Register (searched 2 March 2017), MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to 2
March 2017), Embase (Elsevier) (1974 to 3 March 2017), and
LILACS (Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Liter-
ature) (BIREME) (1982 to 3 March 2017). We did not search
the China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) and VIP
databases due to lack of search experts with Chinese language
knowledge, but we did consider articles identified in the previous
search.
We used the search strategy described in Appendix 1 to search
MEDLINEandCENTRAL. We combinedthe MEDLINEsearch
with the Cochrane Highly Sensitive Search Strategy for identifying
randomised trials in MEDLINE: sensitivity- and precision-max-
imising version (2008 revision); Ovid format (Lefebvre 2011). We
adapted the search strategy to search Embase (Appendix 2) and
LILACS (Appendix 3).
Searching other resources
We handsearched references of all included studies for more trials.
We reviewed trials included in recent systematic reviews assessing
steroids for pneumonia for inclusion eligibility (Horita 2015;
Marti 2015; Siemieniuk 2015; Wan 2016).
We also searched the following conference proceedings: European
Congress of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (2001
to 2016) and ICAAC/Annual Meeting of the Infectious Diseases

 Society of America (IDSA) (2001 to 2016) and intensive care
conference proceedings.
We searched trial registers for ongoing and unpublished trials:
WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP)
(who.int/ictrp/en, searched 3 March 2017), ISRCTN registry (
www.isrctn.com, searched 3 March 2017), and ClinicalTrials.gov
(www.clinicaltrials.gov, searched 3 March 2017).
Data collection and analysis
Selection of studies
Two review authors (AS, KS) independently screened titles and
abstracts for inclusion of all potential studies identified as a result
of the search.
We retrieved full-text study reports, and two review authors (AS,
KS) independently screened the full texts to identify studies for in-
clusion and recorded reasons for exclusion of the ineligible studies.
Any disagreements were resolved by discussion or by consulting a
third review author (MP). We identified and excluded duplicates
and planned to collate multiple reports of the same study so that
each study, rather than each report, was the unit of interest in the
review. We did not use any language or publication status restric-
tions. We recorded the selection process in a PRISMA flow dia-
gram and Characteristics of excluded studies tables (Moher 2009).
Data extraction and management
We used a data collection form for study characteristics and out-
come data that had been piloted. Two review authors (AS and
KS or EC) independently extracted study characteristics from the
included studies. We extracted the following study characteristics.
1. Methods: study design, total duration of study, details of
any ’run in’ period, number of study centres and location, study
setting, withdrawals, and date of study.
2. Participants: N, mean age, severity of condition,
comorbidities, inclusion criteria, and exclusion criteria.
3. Interventions: intervention, comparison, concomitant
antibiotic therapy, and excluded medications.
4. Outcomes: primary and secondary outcomes specified and
collected, and time points reported.
5. Notes: funding for trial, and notable conflicts of interest of
trial authors.
Two review authors (AS, KS or EC) independently extracted out-
come data from the included studies. We planned to note in the
Characteristics of included studies table if outcome data were not
reported in a usable way. Any disagreements were resolved by con-
sensus or by involving a third review author (MP or LL). One re-
view author (AS) transferred data into the Review Manager 5 file
(Review Manager 2014). We double-checked that data were en-
tered correctly by comparing the data presented in the systematic
review with the study reports. A second review author (MP) spot-
checked study characteristics for accuracy against the trial report.
Assessment of risk of bias in included studies
Two review authors (AS, KS) independently assessed risk of bias
for each study using the criteria outlined in the Cochrane Hand-
book for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2011). Any
disagreements were resolved by discussion or by involving another
review author (MP). We assessed risk of bias according to the fol-
lowing domains.
1. Random sequence generation.
2. Allocation concealment.
3. Blinding of participants and personnel.
4. Blinding of outcome assessment.
5. Incomplete outcome data.
6. Selective outcome reporting.
7. Other bias.
We graded each potential source of bias as high, low, or unclear and
provided quotes from the study report together with a justification
for our judgement in the ’Risk of bias’ table. We summarised the
’Risk of bias’ judgements across different studies for each of the
domains listed. We considered blinding separately for different
key outcomes where necessary. Where information on risk of bias
related to unpublished data or correspondence with a trialist, we
noted this in the ’Risk of bias’ table.
When considering treatment effects, we took into account the risk
of bias for the studies that contributed to that outcome.
Measures of treatment effect
We entered outcome data for each study into the data tables in Re-
viewManager5tocalculate the treatmenteffects(Review Manager
2014). We used risk ratios for dichotomous outcomes and abso-
lute mean differences for continuous outcomes (time to and dura-
tions). When means and standard deviations were not provided for
the continuous outcomes in the primary studies, we estimated the
means and standard deviations from the reported figures (medians,
interquartile ranges) to enable meta-analysis, using the methods
described by Wan 2014.
Dealing with missing data
We contacted investigators to verify key study characteristics and
obtain missing numerical outcome data. Where this was not pos-
sible, and the missing data were thought to introduce serious bias,
we explored the impact of including these studies in the overall
assessment of results by a sensitivity analysis.
Where numerical outcome data were missing and could not be
obtained from the authors, we calculated data from other available
statistics such as P values according to the methods described in the
Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins
2011).

 Assessment of heterogeneity
We used the I² statistic to measure heterogeneity among the trials
in each analysis. Where we identified substantial heterogeneity, we
reported this with details from our exploration of possible causes
according to prespecified subgroup analysis.
Assessment of reporting biases
We planned that if we were able to pool more than 10 trials, we
would create and examine a funnel plot to explore possible small-
study and publication biases.
Data synthesis
We undertook meta-analyses where more than one study provided
usable data in any single comparison, only where this was mean-
ingful, that is if the treatments, participants, and the underlying
clinical question were sufficiently similar and clinically homoge-
neous for pooling to make sense. We pooled risk ratios (RRs) and
mean differences (MDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). As
we observed no events in all trials for the analysis of mortality in
children, we pooled risk differences (RDs) to estimate the 95%
CIs of no difference between arms. We assumed clinical hetero-
geneity, and initially applied the random-effects model to all meta-
analyses. However, as results of the fixed-effect and random-ef-
fects models were similar, we used a fixed-effect meta-analysis to
summarise the best estimate of the intervention effect, given that
most meta-analyses included few studies and so as not exaggerate
the contribution of small studies (Higgins 2011).
We performed data analysis using Review Manager 5 software
(Review Manager 2014).
GRADE and ’Summary of findings’ table
We created a ’Summary of findings’ table using the following
outcomes: mortality and early clinical failure. We used the five
GRADE considerations (study limitations, consistency of effect,
imprecision, indirectness, and publication bias) to assess the qual-
ity of a body of evidence as it relates to the studies that contribute
data to the meta-analyses for the prespecified outcomes (Atkins
2004). We used methods and recommendations described in Sec-
tion 8.5 and Chapter 12 of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic
Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2011), employing GRADEpro
GDT software (GRADEpro GDT 2015). We downgraded the
evidence from ’high quality’ by one level for serious, and by two
levels for very serious study limitations or risk of bias, indirectness
of evidence, inconsistency across the included studies, lack of pre-
cision of effect estimates, or potential publication bias.
Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity
We conducted subgroup analyses a priori for adults and children.
We used the Chi² test to test for subgroup interactions in Review
Manager 5 software (Review Manager 2014). We expected fur-
ther heterogeneity in the effect estimates for mortality and clinical
failure by the following factors and conducted subgroup analysis
when data provided in the primary studies allowed. When out-
come data were not provided by the studies for the specific sub-
group, we conducted meta-regression.
• Pneumonia and sepsis severity: analysed by a trial-level or
participant-level subgroup analysis of severe versus non-severe
pneumonia. Severe pneumonia was assessed using the
Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI) and defined as ≥ 4 or
equivalent. We regarded trials that did not subgroup participants
according to pneumonia severity as including people with severe
pneumonia if the mortality rate in the control arm was 9% or
more, based on PSI IV mortality rate of 9.3% (Fine 1997). We
also analysed this factor at the study level using meta-regression
of the percentage of participants in the study with hypotension
at presentation (systolic blood pressure < 90 mm Hg).
• Place and mode of acquisition of the infection (CAP +
HCAP/HAP/VAP): analysed by subgroup analyses.
• Underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
(COPD): analysed using meta-regression of the percentage of
participants with COPD in the trial.
• Pathogen causing the pneumonia: analysed through meta-
regression of the percentage of participants with S pneumoniae,
Legionella spp, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, and Mycoplasma
pneumoniae infections.
We performed meta-regression using Comprehensive Meta-
Analysis V3.
Sensitivity analysis
We examined the effect of risk of bias on the results for mortal-
ity through sensitivity analysis on allocation concealment, as the
most likely factor potentially affecting effect estimates for all-cause
mortality (Wood 2008).

Description of studies
Results of the search
The searches yielded 5545 distinct references. We removed 1272
records because they were duplicates. We assessed the titles of 4273
and the abstracts of 88 distinct records. After removing irrelevant
and clearly ineligible studies, we assessed the full texts of 24 studies
for eligibility. We included 17 studies in the review and meta-
analysis, excluded six studies, and identified one study as awaiting
classification because of unclear design and inconsistency in results
(Figure 1).

Included studies
Details of the included studies are summarised in the
Characteristics of included studies table.
We included 17 randomised controlled trials in this update, five of
which were included in the 2011 review (Chen 2011). The studies
were performed between 1966 and 2014, but Marik 1993 did not
specify recruitment dates. Six of the studies were multicentre trials
including from two to seven centres, all in a single country (Blum
2015; Confalonieri 2005; Meijvis 2011; Sabry 2011; Torres 2015;
Van Woensel 2003), and 11 studies were single-centre trials. The
trials were conducted worldwide: eight in Europe, four in China
or Japan, three in the Middle East, and one each in South Africa
and Australia.
All included trials limited inclusion to participants with CAP
, with
or without HCAP
, who were treated as inpatients. None of the
trials included people with CAP who were treated in the commu-
nity, HAP
, or VAP
. Inclusion was not limited by CAP pathogens
in all adult trials. Van Woensel 2003 included only young chil-
dren who were mechanically ventilated due to respiratory syncy-
tial virus lower respiratory tract infections (82 infants, of whom
41 had pneumonia). Two trials limited inclusion to children with
M pneumoniae (Luo 2014; Wu 2014).
A total of 2264 participants were randomised (1122 to the inter-
vention arm), of whom 1954 (86%) were adults (n = 13 trials,
mean age 69.8 years) and 307 (14%) were children (n = 4 trials,
mean age 5.6 years, Luo 2014; Nagy 2013; Van Woensel 2003;
Wu 2014). Of the adult trials, three reported that no people with
chronic lung disease were included (Mikami 2007; Nafae 2013;
Sabry 2011); in six trials reporting data between 11.2% and 35.9%
of participants had chronic lung disease. A single trial reported
that people with diabetes mellitus were not included (McHardy
11

 1972), and in five trials between 10.3% and 19.7% of participants
had diabetes.
Six trials included only adults with severe pneumonia. Four trials
defined severe pneumonia according to the Infectious Diseases So-
ciety of America and American Thoracic Society guidelines (ATS/
IDSA guidelines) for severe pneumonia, Mandell 2007, or ear-
lier versions of these guidelines (Confalonieri 2005; El-Ghamrawy
2006; Sabry 2011; Torres 2015). Marik 1993 defined severe pneu-
monia as presentation of three or more British Thoracic Soci-
ety (BTS) criteria for severe pneumonia (BTS guidelines 1987).
Fernández-Serrano 2011 defined pneumonia as the presence of
respiratory failure and extensive radiologically confirmed consoli-
dations.
The intervention included oral prednisone in three trials (Blum
2015; Luo 2014; McHardy 1972), and intravenous dexametha-
sone, hydrocortisone, or methylprednisolone in 13 trials. One
trial used prednisone without limiting the administration route
(Snijders 2010). The duration of corticosteroid treatment was
10 days in one trial (Fernández-Serrano 2011), seven to 10 days
in one trial (Wu 2014), seven days in seven trials (Blum 2015;
Confalonieri 2005; El-Ghamrawy 2006; McHardy 1972; Nafae
2013; Sabry 2011; Snijders 2010), five days in three trials (Luo
2014; Nagy 2013; Torres 2015), and two to four days in four trials
(Hatakeyama 1995; Meijvis 2011; Mikami 2007; Van Woensel
2003). In one trial only one dose of corticosteroids was given
(Marik 1993). Most adult trials used steroid doses equivalent to
40 mg to 50 mg of prednisone per day. The comparator for cor-
ticosteroids was placebo in 11 trials and no treatment in six trials
(Confalonieri 2005; Luo 2014; McHardy 1972; Mikami 2007;
Sabry 2011; Wu 2014).
Seven trials were funded by academic sponsors (Blum 2015;
Confalonieri 2005; Fernández-Serrano 2011; Meijvis 2011; Nagy
2013; Torres 2015; Van Woensel 2003), one trial was funded by a
pharmaceutical company (Snijders 2010), and one trial reported
receiving no funding (Sabry 2011). The remaining eight trials did
not report their funding source. We sought additional data for all
trials, which two authors supplied (Blum 2015; Torres 2015).
Excluded studies
We excluded six studies (see Characteristics of excluded studies
table). One trial that was included in the 2011 review was ex-
cluded because it examined the use of inhaled corticosteroids
(Cao 2007). Other reasons for exclusion were: not limited to peo-
ple with pneumonia (Van Woensel 2011), corticosteroids given
to both treatment arms (Huang 2014), participants in the con-
trol group were subsequently given either corticosteroids or in-
travenous immunoglobulin therapy (Shan 2017), quasi-randomi-
sation (Wagner 1956), and one non-randomised trial (Montón
1999).
Studies awaiting classification
One trial that assessed children with refractory M pneumoniae
pneumonia is awaiting classification (Lan 2015). We contacted the
authors for clarification about study design and inconsistencies in
reported results.
Risk of bias in included studies
Risk of bias for all trials is summarised in Figure 2 and Figure 3.

 Allocation
We assessed generation of the randomisation sequencing as low
risk of bias in eight trials (Blum 2015; Confalonieri 2005; Marik
1993; Meijvis 2011; Nagy 2013; Snijders 2010; Torres 2015;
Van Woensel 2003). The risk of bias was unclear in nine trials.
We assessed the risk of bias for allocation concealment as low in
eight trials (Blum 2015; Confalonieri 2005; Hatakeyama 1995;
McHardy 1972; Meijvis 2011; Snijders 2010; Torres 2015; Van
Woensel 2003), and unclear in nine trials.
Blinding
We assessed nine double-blinded, placebo-controlled trials as at
low risk of bias (Blum 2015; Confalonieri 2005; Fernández-
Serrano 2011; Hatakeyama 1995; Meijvis 2011; Sabry 2011;
Snijders 2010; Torres 2015; Van Woensel 2003). We assessed
seven open-label trials as at high risk of bias (Luo 2014; Marik
1993; McHardy 1972; Mikami 2007; Nafae 2013; Nagy 2013;
Wu 2014). El-Ghamrawy 2006 used a placebo, but did not de-
scribe blinding and was therefore assessed as at unclear risk of bias.
We assessed four trials in which outcome assessors were blinded as
at low risk of bias (Blum 2015; Confalonieri 2005; Meijvis 2011;
Torres 2015). Nine trials did not specify if outcome assessors were
blinded and were assessed as at unclear risk of bias (El-Ghamrawy
2006; Fernández-Serrano2011; Hatakeyama1995; Mikami 2007;
Nafae 2013; Sabry 2011; Snijders 2010; Van Woensel 2003; Wu
2014). We assessed four trials in which outcome assessors were not
blinded as at high risk of bias (Luo 2014; Marik 1993; McHardy
1972; Nagy 2013).
Incomplete outcome data
Eleven trials provided full intention-to-treat analysis (all randomly
assigned participants were included in the analysis for mortality).
In five trials there was postrandomisation exclusion of partici-
pants, but numbers of dropouts were given per study arm and rea-
sons for exclusion were provided (Blum 2015; Confalonieri 2005;
Fernández-Serrano 2011; Torres 2015; Van Woensel 2003), there-
fore we judged these trials as at low risk of attrition bias. McHardy
1972 reported postrandomisation exclusions, but did not provide
the number and study arm distribution of these participants and
was therefore judged as at unclear risk of bias.
Selective reporting
Trial registries were available for seven studies conducted from
2010 onwards (Blum 2015; Fernández-Serrano 2011; Meijvis
2011; Nagy 2013; Sabry 2011; Snijders 2010; Torres 2015). Only
one of these seven studies prespecified all study outcomes in the
registry (Fernández-Serrano 2011), therefore we judged the re-
maining studies as at high risk of reporting bias. Of the trials that
did not have a registry, most were conducted before mandatory
trial registry, but three were relatively new trials and were therefore
judged as being at high risk of reporting bias as well (Luo 2014;
Nafae 2013; Wu 2014). Of the older trials without a registry, only
Van Woensel 2003 had full agreement in outcomes between meth-
ods and results, hence we judged the remaining studies as at high
risk of reporting bias.
Other potential sources of bias
Eight studies reported on sample size calculations and were clas-
sified as being at low risk of other potential sources of bias (Blum
2015; Fernández-Serrano 2011; Meijvis 2011; Mikami 2007;
Nagy 2013; Snijders 2010; Torres 2015; Van Woensel 2003).
Confalonieri 2005 reported on sample size calculation but also
reported on having an early stop for benefit, when the upper stop-
ping boundary defined for stopping was crossed for the outcome
of PaO
:FiO
, and was thus classified as being at high risk of
other potential sources of bias. We classified the remaining eight
studies as being at unclear risk of bias for this domain.
Effects of interventions

Corticosteroids compared to control for pneumonia
Primary outcome
1. All-cause mortality
Adults
All-cause mortality was reported in 11 of the 13 trials that included
adults (N = 1863). Corticosteroid therapy was associated with a
significantly lower rate of all-cause mortality compared to control
(risk ratio (RR) 0.66, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.47 to 0.92;
I² = 0%, fixed-effect model). Despite the lack of statistical het-
erogeneity in this analysis, the benefit was larger and statistically
significant in studies with unclear allocation concealment meth-
ods (RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.71) compared to studies using
low-risk methods (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.19; Analysis 1.1;
moderate-quality evidence) (Summary of findings for the main
comparison). No small-studies effectwas demonstrated in the fun-
nel plot analysis (Figure 4).

Mortality - adults.
Subgroup analyses
Nine studies (995 participants) provided data on participants with
severe pneumonia. All-cause mortality was significantly lower for
participants receiving corticosteroids compared to control (RR
0.58, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.84; I² = 12%, fixed-effect model). We
judged the quality of the evidence as moderate due to differences
in effect estimates between low and unclear risk of bias (Analysis
1.2). Excluding Confalonieri 2005, which was stopped early due
to significant difference between the groups based on predefined
stopping rules, with 0 deaths in the steroid arm, did not signifi-
cantly change the overall result (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.95),
but brought the difference between the trials at low risk or bias
and unclear risk of bias to statistical significance (P = 0.03 for sub-
group differences). Four trials reported mortality in participants
with non-severe pneumonia (868 participants). There was no sig-
nificant difference between corticosteroid therapy and control (RR
0.95, 95% CI 0.45 to 2.00; fixed-effect model). We graded the
quality of the evidence as moderate due the large confidence in-
tervals leading to uncertainty in the true effect estimate. In the
meta-regression analysis, higher mortality in the control arm was
significantly associated with a larger effect of corticosteroids on
mortality, with the ratio of log RRs decreasing by 0.217 for every
1% increase in the mortality rate of the control arm (P = 0.007,
Figure 5).

 Figure 5.
Meta-regression of the log risk ratios for the effect of steroids on mortality against the mortality
rate (%) in the control group.
Most adult trials reporting on mortality used corticosteroid doses
equivalent to 40 mg to 50 mg of prednisone per day, for 5 to 10
days. All studies included participants with CAP or HCAP
. Partic-
ipants with HAP or VAP were excluded, therefore subgroup anal-
ysis by place of acquisition was not possible. None of the studies
provided mortality data for the subgroups of septic shock versus
no septic shock and by specific pathogens, and only one study
reported mortality in the subgroup of participants with chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (Blum 2015). In meta-
regression analyses for these factors, no significant association was
found between the risk ratios in individual trials and percent-
age of participants with septic shock (six studies), COPD (nine
studies, three of which excluded participants with COPD), or
pathogens causing pneumonia (analysing the percentage of par-
ticipants with documented Pneumococcal pneumonia, pneumonia
caused by atypical bacteria or isolation of a virus). The percent-
age of participants with no microbiological documented infection
was inversely associated with the effect of corticosteroids, but this
association was not statistically significant. In a post hoc meta-
regression analysis according to mean age of study population, the
effect was significantly smaller with increasing age, with the ratio
of log RRs increasing by 0.05 for every 1% increase in the mean
age (P = 0.018, Figure 6).

Children
There were no reported deaths in the four trials that included
children (risk difference (RD) 0.00, 95% CI -0.03 to 0.03; 4 trials,
266 children, Analysis 1.4).
Secondary outcomes
1. Early clinical failure
Adults
Six trials reported the outcome of early clinical failure (1324 par-
ticipants). The definitions used in the trials varied and are reported
in Table 1. There was a significantly lower rate of early clinical fail-
ure in participants treated with corticosteroids compared to con-
trols (RR 0.40, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.7; random-effects model). We
found substantial heterogeneity in this analysis (Analysis 1.5, I² =
72%). We downgraded the quality of the data for this outcome to
moderate due to inconsistency, despite the large effect.
Subgroup analyses
Five trials including 419 participants provided data regarding early
clinical failure in participants with severe pneumonia, and two
trials including 905 participants reported this outcome in partic-
ipants with non-severe pneumonia. In both subgroups the rate of
early clinical failure was significantly lower in the corticosteroid
arm compared to control (RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.7; I² =
74% for severe pneumonia, and RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.56 to 0.83; I²
= 0% for non-severe pneumonia, random-effects model; Analysis
1.5). Heterogeneity in the subgroup of severe pneumonia resulted
from different magnitudes of benefit rather than from opposing
direct of effects. We graded the evidence for both analyses as of
high quality.
The dose of corticosteroid used in most adult trials reporting on
early clinical failure was equivalent to 40 mg to 50 mg of pred-
nisone per day, for 5 to 10 days. Only Confalonieri 2005 reported
clinical failure in the subgroup of participants with septic shock.
No trials reported on this outcome by pathogen or among partic-
ipants with and without COPD. Meta-regression analyses could
not be fitted due to the paucity of studies reporting on the out-
come and participant characteristics.
Children
The outcome of early clinical failure was reported in two studies
(88 children) with definitions provided in Table 1, and was sig-
nificantly lower in the corticosteroid group compared to the con-
trol group (RR 0.41, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.70; I² = 25%, fixed-effect
model; Analysis 1.6). We graded this analysis as high quality.
In an analysis by allocation concealment among adults and chil-
dren combined, early clinical failure was significantly lower in the
corticosteroid arm both for trials with low risk of bias (RR 0.59,
95% CI 0.37 to 0.94) and trials with unclear risk RR 0.27, 95%
17

 CI 0.14 to 0.52; random-effects model; Analysis 1.7). The num-
ber of studies was too small for a funnel plot analysis.
2. Time to clinical cure
Adults
Nine trials reported time to clinical cure (1322 participants). We
accepted the definitions provided in all studies (Table 1). Three
trials reported this outcome as median with interquartile range
(IQR) (Blum 2015; Fernández-Serrano 2011; Torres 2015), and
one trial reported median with range (Confalonieri 2005). For
these trials, means and standard deviations (SDs) were estimated
from the median value provided. The time to clinical cure was sig-
nificantly shorter in the corticosteroid group compared to placebo,
but we found substantial heterogeneity in this analysis (mean dif-
ference (MD) -1.83 days, 95% CI -2.45 to -1.21; I² = 83%, ran-
dom-effects model; Analysis 1.8). In a sensitivity analysis, exclud-
ing the trials that did not meet our predefined criteria for clinical
cure did not significantly affect results.
Children
Four trials reported time to clinical cure, of which three studies
(225 children) evaluated bacterial pneumonia and one included
41 children with respiratory syncytial virus pneumonia. In one
trial (Nagy 2013), mean and SD were estimated from the median
and IQR. In the three trials evaluating bacterial pneumonia, time
to clinical cure was significantly shorter in the corticosteroid arm
compared to the control arm (MD -1.57 days, 95% CI -2.55 to
-0.60 days; I² = 80%, random-effects model; Analysis 1.9). Van
Woensel 2003, which evaluated viral pneumonia, showed no effect
of corticosteroids on time to clinical cure. Here we also accepted
the study definitions for time to clinical cure, which were not
compatible with our protocol definitions (Table 1).
3. Development of respiratory failure not present initially
The need for new non-invasive or invasive mechanical ventilation,
not present at onset of pneumonia, was reported in four adult
trials (1030 participants) and was significantly lower in the corti-
costeroid arm compared to the control arm without heterogene-
ity (RR 0.40, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.77; fixed-effect model; Analysis
1.10).
4. Development of shock not present initially
The development of shock not present initially was reported in
six adult trials (five including participants with severe pneumo-
nia) and was significantly lower in the corticosteroid arm without
heterogeneity (RR 0.18, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.34; fixed-effect model;
Analysis 1.11).
5. Transfer to ICU among participants not admitted initially
to the ICU
In the four adult trials (1164 participants) reporting the need
for ICU transfer (2 included participants with non-severe pneu-
monia), we found no significant difference between the corticos-
teroids and control arms (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.18; I² = 0%,
fixed-effect model; Analysis 1.12).
6. Duration of hospital stay for hospitalised participants
Adults
The length of hospital stay was significantly shorter in the corti-
costeroid group compared to control (MD -2.91 days, 95% CI -
4.92 to -0.89; 9 trials, 1658 participants; Analysis 1.13). We found
considerable heterogeneity for this analysis (I² = 91%), analysed
using the random-effects model. Five of the trials provided median
(range/IQR) values for this outcome, and means with standard
deviations were calculated or requested from authors.
Children
One trial including children with bacterial pneumonia, Nagy
2013, and one trial including children with viral pneumonia, Van
Woensel 2003, reported lengths of hospital stay. We did not pool
results due to significant heterogeneity, with a significant benefit
to steroids in the trial on bacterial pneumonia (MD -4.70 days
with steroids, 95% CI -7.50 to -1.90) and no difference in the
trial on viral pneumonia (Analysis 1.15).
7. Duration of ICU stay for participants admitted to the ICU
For adults who were admitted to the ICU (342 participants from
8 studies), ICU stay was significantly shorter in the corticosteroid
group compared to control (MD -1.88 days, 95% CI -2.96 to
-0.81; I² = 46%, fixed-effect model; Analysis 1.14). Five trials
provided median values (range/IQR) for this outcome, and means
(SD) were calculated from these values.
8. Pneumonia complications not present initially
Nine trials reported pneumonia complications, including eight
adult trials (1573 participants) and one trial in children (59 chil-
dren). Most trials defined this outcome as a combination of lung
abscess, empyema or pleural effusion. One trial defined complica-
tionsassepticshockoracute respiratorydistresssyndrome (ARDS)
(Nafae 2013), and two trials evaluated this outcome without pro-
viding a definition. The rate of pneumonia complications was sig-
nificantly lower for the corticosteroid arm when compared to con-
trols (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.84; I² = 43%, fixed-effect model;
Analysis 1.16).

 9. Secondary infections
For adults, we found no difference in the rate of secondary in-
fections between the corticosteroid group and the control group
(RR 1.19, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.93; 7 trials, 1533 participants, I² =
0%, fixed-effect model; Analysis 1.17). All trials addressing this
outcome in children had no reported cases of secondary infections
(RD 0.00, 95% CI -0.03 to 0.03; 3 trials, 225 children; Analysis
1.18).
10. Adverse events
Adults
Three trials reported on any adverse event (1028 participants).
There was a trend towards more adverse events in the corticos-
teroid arm compared to control, but with no statistical signifi-
cance (RR 1.21, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.47; fixed-effect model; Analysis
1.19). Hyperglycaemia developed significantly more frequently in
the corticosteroid arm (RR 1.72, 95% CI 1.38 to 2.14; 7 trials,
1578 participants, I² = 0%, fixed-effect model; Analysis 1.20). We
found no significant difference between the two arms for gastroin-
testinal bleeding (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.40 to 2.05; 7 trials, 1190
participants, fixed-effect model; Analysis 1.21), neuropsychiatric
adverse events (RR 1.95, 95% CI 0.70 to 5.42; 4 trials, 1149
participants, fixed-effect model; Analysis 1.22), or adverse cardiac
events (RR 0.6, 95% CI 0.32 to 1.13; 5 trials, 1249 participants,
fixed-effect model; Analysis 1.23).
Children
No adverse events were reported in trials in children. Two trials
reported no adverse event in either arm (Analysis 1.24), and one
trial reported no cases of hyperglycaemia.

Summary of main results
In this review, we summarised the evidence on corticosteroid ther-
apy, in addition to antibiotics, for pneumonia. Throughout the
review, we separated the evidence for adults and children.
For adults, corticosteroids significantly reduced mortality for par-
ticipants with severe pneumonia (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.84),
number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome
(NNTB) 18 patients (95% CI 12 to 49 patients). We assessed
the quality of the evidence as moderate because unclear allocation
concealment methods exaggerated effect estimates. There was no
benefit or harm for steroids with non-severe pneumonia (RR 0.95,
95% CI 0.45 to 2.00). Overall, we found an association between
the mean age of study population and the effect of corticosteroids
such that the effect was significantly smaller with increasing age
(P = 0.018). Early clinical failure, defined as lack of clinical or
radiological improvement, or both, between days five and eight,
was significantly reduced with corticosteroids for participants with
severe and non-severe pneumonia, but the benefit was larger and
the NNTB was smaller for severe pneumonia (RR 0.32, 95% CI
0.15 to 0.7; NNTB 4, 95% CI 3 to 8 patients versus RR 0.68,
95% CI 0.56 to 0.83; NNTB 8, 95% CI 6 to 16 patients, respec-
tively; high-quality evidence). Corticosteroids reduced the time to
clinical cure, length of hospital stay, and length of ICU stay for
participants admitted to the ICU. Similarly, the development of
respiratory failure necessitating mechanical ventilation, the devel-
opment of shock not present at pneumonia onset, and the rate
of pneumonia complications, mostly pyogenic (RR 0.58, 95% CI
0.40 to 0.84), were reduced among corticosteroid-treated partic-
ipants. Of the adverse events, only hyperglycaemia was signifi-
cantly more common among corticosteroids-treated participants
(RR 1.72, 95% CI 1.38 to 2.14). There was no significant dif-
ference between groups for gastrointestinal, neuropsychiatric, and
cardiac adverse events and superinfections (RR 1.19, 95% CI 0.73
to 1.93).
The paediatric trials were few and heterogenous, two including
only children with M pneumoniae pneumonia (Luo 2014; Wu
2014), one children with any pneumonia (Nagy 2013), and one
children with severe respiratory syncytial virus pneumonitis/pneu-
monia (Van Woensel 2011). There were no deaths in these tri-
als. In the bacterial pneumonia trials, corticosteroids reduced early
clinical failure rates (RR 0.41, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.70; high-quality
evidence) and shortened the time to clinical cure. In the single trial
assessing children with respiratory syncytial virus, no benefit with
regard to time to clinical cure was observed with corticosteroids.
No adverse events were reported.
Overall completeness and applicability of
evidence
The inclusion criteria for this review were designed to include all
types of pneumonia; the search was not limited by participant age,
place of acquisition of pneumonia, or the type of pathogen causing
it. However, the completeness of the results is affected by the trials
found and types of pneumonia studied. The results of this review
apply only to hospitalised CAP and HCAP
. We included adult and
paediatric trials, but separated the analyses due to the differences
between them in terms of outcomes. The reported rates of death
from CAP in children are as low as 0.01% to 0.001% (Lee 2010),
compared to 10% to 12% in adults (Musher 2014). Indeed, none
of the paediatric trials included in our review reported deaths or
complications as defined in this review.
Among adults, there is an overall advantage to corticosteroid ther-
apy. The question remains as to whom this benefit applies: who
are the patients that will gain from corticosteroid therapy when
19

 hospitalised with CAP/HCAP? The first clear group to emerge is
those with severe pneumonia defined using ATS/IDSA or BTS
criteria (BTS guidelines 1987; Mandell 2007). Among patients
with severe CAP/HCAP
, 18 patients need to be treated to prevent
one death and four to prevent one clinical failure at five to eight
days. The corticosteroid regimen most commonly used in these
trials was an intravenous (IV) formulation equivalent to 40 mg to
50 mg of prednisone per day for five to 10 days. Few trials used
higher dosing, up to 90 mg of prednisone-equivalents a day, and
one old trial used a single dose of IV hydrocortisone 10 mg/kg
(Marik 1993). Corticosteroid therapy has been shown to reduce
mortality rates in people with septic shock (Annane 2009), and
have conflicting effects on people with ARDS (Ruan 2014). The
Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guidelines recommend IV hydrocor-
tisone at a dose of 200 mg per day to people with septic shock
not restoring haemodynamic stability after adequate fluid resusci-
tation and vasopressor therapy (Rhodes 2017). It is not possible to
determine to what extent the effect of corticosteroids on mortality
in severely ill patients is explained by its effect on septic shock
or ARDS. However, meta-regression did not show an association
between the percentage of patients with septic shock and the ef-
fect of corticosteroid therapy on mortality, pointing at the possi-
ble contribution of corticosteroid in pneumonia independent of
septic shock. People with pneumonia and septic shock have, by
definition, severe pneumonia, and the same steroid regimen ap-
plies to both, except that with septic shock the recommendations
are to continue steroids until haemodynamic stability is reached
followed by tapering off.
Some people with pneumonia may be affected by corticosteroid
therapy differently than others. Corticosteroids have been shown
to significantly reduce failure among people with COPD exacer-
bation, but not mortality (Walters 2014), thus people with COPD
exacerbation and CAP might gain more from corticosteroid ther-
apy than other patients. We could not perform a subgroup analysis
to determine if there is a difference in the effect of corticosteroids
in patients with or without COPD due to the paucity of trials
providing relevant data. A meta-regression analysis did not show
an association between the percentage of participants with COPD
in the trials and corticosteroid effects on mortality. To note, three
trials excluded people with COPD.
People with diabetes mellitus may be adversely affected by cor-
ticosteroid therapy by being more prone to hyperglycaemia and
its detrimental effect on survival in acutely ill patients (Krinsley
2003). We did not perform subgroup analyses according to this
confounder due to the paucity of outcome data. Overall, hyper-
glycaemia was significantly more common with corticosteroids.
Elderly patients with pneumonia have higher rates of treatment
failure, need for intensive care, and mortality (Kaplan 2002). The
trials included in this review were not limited by age definitions,
but as previously shown, participants’ mean age in these ran-
domised controlled trials was lower than that of people treated for
CAP in clinical practice (Avni 2015). There were no outcome data
by age subgroup, but by meta-regression we observed decreasing
effects of corticosteroid therapy on mortality with increasing mean
age of the trials’ population, denoting a smaller survival benefit
with aging. This finding could be linked to more diabetes with
increasing age, the neuropsychiatric effects of corticosteroids (al-
though not shown in the overall analysis), or different inflamma-
tory response in elderly patients.
The pathogenesis of pneumonia may be different with different
causative pathogens. The inflammatory response caused by bacte-
rial pneumonia is thus different from that caused by viral pneumo-
nia, and the radiographic presentation of ’atypical’ bacteria is dif-
ferent from that of S pneumoniae or other bacteria causing pneu-
monia (Virkki 2002). None of the adult trials included in this
review restricted the inclusion to specific pathogens, and none re-
ported relevant outcome data by pathogen. Meta-regression analy-
ses did not show associations between corticosteroid effects and the
percentage of participantsinthe trialswith the differentpathogens.
However, these analyses were also limited by the fact that the bac-
terial aetiology of CAP/HCAP is frequently unknown, and data
were frequently not reported. Some of the cases of pneumonia with
no microbiological documented infection may actually represent
pulmonary infiltrates of a non-infectious, inflammatory aetiology
(e.g. organising pneumonia). A possible theory might be that the
effect of corticosteroids in pneumonia is at least partially driven by
its effect on the subset of patients with non-infectious pneumonia.
Our results do not support this hypothesis.
The heterogeneity in the paediatric trials precludes strong con-
clusions for children with CAP
. Overall, a significant benefit was
demonstrated with regard to early clinical failure, pointing at the
potential of this intervention. However, we were unable to define
the children likely to benefit from corticosteroids and the dose and
duration from the available trials.
Quality of the evidence
The results for the main outcomes and the quality of evidence
assessments are summarised in Summary of findings for the main
comparison. For the primary outcome of mortality, we assessed all
analyses as of moderate quality. For the outcome of early clinical
failure, we assessed the quality of the main analysis as moderate.
However, we judged the analyses of severe pneumonia, non-severe
pneumonia, and paediatric participants as high quality. Several
reasons led us to downgrade the quality of the evidence. Some of
the trials included in the review had unclear allocation conceal-
ment. We downgraded the evidence quality for risk of bias when
a sensitivity analysis implied that unclear allocation concealment
exaggerated the effect of corticosteroids, but not when such an
effect was not evident. We downgraded quality for imprecision
whenever the 95% CI overlapped no effect with a wide confi-
dence interval so that harm caused by corticosteroids could not
have been ruled out, and for inconsistency whenever considerable
20

 heterogeneity was found. In cases of a risk ratio lower than 0.5,
we upgraded the quality of the evidence by one level.
Potential biases in the review process
This review has a few limitations that should be noted. For most
predefined subgroups, lack of data precluded us from performing
subgroup analyses. Only two trials provided mortality data per
study arm in the subgroups of severe and non-severe pneumonia
(Blum 2015; Snijders 2010). For the remaining trials we classified
the trial as including severe or non-severe pneumonia participants
according to the mortality rate in the control arm. Hence, for most
trials the classification is at the trial level and not at the participant
level. Furthermore, mortality, although reflecting the severity of
pneumonia, may be influenced by other parameters such as the
antibiotic regimens used or the standard of medical care given in
the specific centre. Nevertheless, we found a good correlation be-
tween the trials’ percentage of participants with Pneumonia Sever-
ity Index four to five and our severity classification based on mor-
tality (data not shown). To note, one of the trials that included
people with severe pneumonia by its own definition was actually
classified as non-severe pneumonia according to the mortality rate
in the control arm (Fernández-Serrano 2011).
In place of subgroup analyses, we performed meta-regression. The
primary outcome of mortality was reported in 11 out of the 13
adult trials, thus meta-regression analyses could have been done
for this outcome, but not for the secondary outcomes, which were
reportedinfewertrials. Meta-regressionanalysesmaycontribute to
the understanding of the association between specific confounders
and the effect, but they should be regarded as observational, and
provide only trial-level evidence as opposed to the patient-level
evidence provided by randomised controlled trials.
We chose all-cause mortality as the primary outcome, assuming it
to be the most objective outcome and the most relevant outcome
to patients. This is true for the adult population, but not for the
paediatric trials, where mortality cannot be analysed because of
the very low event rate.
For the outcomes of early clinical failure and time to clinical cure,
we allowed some diversity in the outcome definitions and accepted
definitions that did not meet the strict predefined criteria of the
review. This may lead to an indirectness bias. For example, we
accepted fever resolution as a surrogate for clinical cure. It is true
that a patient would not be held as cured while still febrile, but
the opposite might not be true, as a patient may be afebrile but
not cured.
For some continuous outcomes, we had to estimate means from
medians to perform meta-analysis. This is imprecise, since these
outcomes were reported as medians due to their skewed distribu-
tion. These analyses should thus be viewed with caution.
The dose and schedule of corticosteroids administered varied, as
shown in the Characteristics of included studies table. We did not
account for this variability in our analysis, assuming a common
effect of different corticosteroid regimens.
Agreements and disagreements with other
studies or reviews
The previous version of this review showed that corticosteroid
therapy hastens the resolution of symptoms for people with pneu-
monia, but with no effect on mortality (Chen 2011). In 2015, two
relatively large, high-quality randomised controlled trials evaluat-
ing corticosteroid for people with CAP were published. The first
trial included people with severe pneumonia hospitalised mostly
in the ICU and showed reduced clinical failure rates with corti-
costeroid therapy (Torres 2015). The second trial included peo-
ple with severe and non-severe pneumonia (and provided separate
outcome data) and showed shortened time to clinical stability with
corticosteroids (Blum 2015). Neither of the trials showed an effect
on mortality. Since then, a few reviews and meta-analyses assessing
corticosteroid therapy in pneumonia have been published (Horita
2015; Marti 2015; Siemieniuk 2015; Wan 2016), all showing ben-
efit to corticosteroid therapy but to different extent. Our review
adds several pieces of knowledge over previous reviews. First, we
have shown the importance of allocation concealment even for
the objective outcome of mortality. Trials that did not describe
adequate methods of allocation concealment showed greater mor-
tality reductions with corticosteroids, affecting the overall analysis
of mortality. While Siemieniuk 2015 graded the quality of the
evidence for mortality as moderate, we added a GRADE appraisal
of the evidence for the important subgroup of patients with severe
pneumonia who benefit from corticosteroid therapy. The former
reviews did not assess the outcome of early clinical failure. We
showed that corticosteroids significantly reduce early clinical fail-
ure regardless of the pneumonia severity classification, but that the
effect is larger in the subgroup of patients with severe pneumonia,
a finding that strengthens the result of the mortality analysis. This
is in opposition to Siemieniuk 2015, who assessed the need for
mechanical ventilation as a secondary outcome and found a lower
magnitude of effect in people with severe pneumonia.

Implications for practice
The results of this review support the use of corticosteroids in
adults with severe community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) using
either the Infectious Diseases Society of America and American
Thoracic Society guidelines or British Thoracic Society criteria for
severe CAP
. Among these patients, corticosteroids reduce mortal-
ity, clinical failure, complication rates, length of hospitalisation,
and time to clinical cure. People with non-severe CAP may benefit
21

 from corticosteroid therapy as well, but with no survival advan-
tage. Regarding the latter, caution is required for people with di-
abetes due to the effect of corticosteroids on glucose control. The
quality of the evidence for these conclusions is mostly moderate.
Corticosteroid therapy is associated with more adverse events, es-
pecially hyperglycaemia, but the harm does not seem to outweigh
the benefits.
Regarding paediatric patients, it seems there is some advantage for
corticosteroid therapy, but the low event rate of complications and
the paucity of data preclude recommendation of its regular use.
Implications for research
Further research is needed to clarify the role of corticosteroid
therapy in specific patient populations. There are no randomised
controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the effects of corticosteroids in
people with hospital-acquired pneumonia or ventilator-associated
pneumonia, and too few RCTs have evaluated this question in
paediatric patients. Other populations in which more study is re-
quired are diabetic patients, elderly patients, and those with viral
pneumonia. Future trials should also evaluate the recommended
dose and duration of corticosteroid therapy.

This review is an update of the Chen 2011 review. However, in light of new evidence, changes made in recommendations for treatment
of pneumonia, and changing questions surrounding the evidence on pneumonia management, the review has changed in many aspects
from the original review. We list the essential differences between the 2011 protocol and our update.
• We prospectively rewrote a protocol for this update, before starting the update.
• We defined new objectives for this review not identical to the 2011 review objectives. Specifically, we broadened the efficacy
assessment to include mortality and morbidity, and we did not assess relative adrenal insufficiency and dose-effect relationships, which
were defined as objectives in the original review.
• The inclusion and exclusion criteria for this update are similar to the original 2011 review with a few differences. Differing from
the 2011 review we did not exclude studies including participants with immunosuppression, tuberculosis, acute schistosomiasis,
fungal or parasitic infections, or chemotherapy and radiotherapy, as we believed these can be pooled together with other pneumonia
patients. We excluded studies including neonates and people with HIV and Pneumocystis pneumonia, as we believed these represent
different entities and require separate consideration.
• There were several differences in the types of interventions assessed in this update compared to the 2011 review. First, we
specified corticosteroid therapy to include only systemic administration and exclude inhaled corticosteroids. The mechanisms of
action of these two interventions are different and cannot be pooled. We included only trials comparing corticosteroids to placebo or
no treatment and excluded trials in which corticosteroids were given to both treatment arms, as the question of the review is on the
efficacy of corticosteroid therapy.
• We assessed all-cause mortality as our primary outcome, as this is the currently recommended outcome for assessment in severe
infections and the only outcome that will change practice. We added several secondary outcomes that were not collected in the 2011
review, including early clinical failure, length of hospitalisation, and pneumonia complications. We also specified the outcome of
adverse effects and added outcomes of specific adverse effects including superinfections, adverse effects requiring discontinuation of
corticosteroids, hyperglycaemia, gastrointestinal bleeding, and neuropsychiatric and cardiac adverse events. The outcomes assessed in
our review are aligned with contemporary guidance for outcome assessment in clinical trials of pneumonia (FDA CAP industry
guidance; FDA HAP/VAP industry guidance; Mandell 2007), and we believe that evidence summaries should address these relevant
outcomes. We changed the outcome definition of ’mortality’ to ’all-cause mortality’ because we believe that ’all-cause mortality’ more
clearly specifies that we collected all death cases including pneumonia-related cases and cases not related to pneumonia. To note, we
revised the outcomes during the writing of the protocol and before starting the update.
• We changed subgroup analyses to address the contemporary relevant clinical questions. We performed subgroup analyses based
on different patient characteristics (pneumonia severity, comorbidities, pathogen, etc.) and added meta-regression analyses when
subgroup analysis was not applicable.
• We re-applied inclusion and exclusion criteria and re-extracted all data in duplicate, since we did not agree with the study
selection and outcome extraction in a sample of tested articles, and since ’Risk of bias’ methodology has developed since the 2011
review.
