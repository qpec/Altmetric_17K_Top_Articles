Context: Binge drinking is a salient problem on college campuses, with estimates
as high as 40% of students engaging in it. Binge drinking is associated with numer-
ous negative consequences among college students, such as suicide attempts, unsafe
sex practices, property damage, and driving under the influence. Several behavioral
approaches in this regard have had modest impact and only short-term effects,
however.
Objective: To use the multitheory model (MTM) of health behavior change to
predict initiation and sustenance of responsible drinking or abstinence among
binge-drinking college students in a sample drawn from a large southern public
university.
Methods: This cross-sectional survey study included a sample of college students
who binge drank in the past 30 days. A 39-item face- and content-valid instrument
was used. In addition, construct validity using confirmatory factor analysis and
internal consistency reliability using the Cronbach α were established. Hierarchical
regression modeling was used to build models.
Results: A total of 289 students participated. The Cronbach α for the scale and all
subscales ranged from 0.81 to 0.94 and demonstrated acceptable internal consistency
reliability. Construct validity using confirmatory factor analysis yielded 1-factor
solutions for each of the subscales. On hierarchical regression modeling, gender
(P=.05), race/ethnicity (P=.004), behavioral confidence (P=.029), and changes in
physical environment (P=.001) were associated with intended initiation for drinking
responsibly/abstinence behavior change. The addition of MTM constructs led to a
significant increase in R2 of 0.20 (F3,194=18.1; P<.001). The sustenance constructs
yielded a significant increase in R2 of 0.20 (F3,193=19.4; P<.001).
Conclusion: This study provides empirical justification for MTM constructs that
can be used to inculcate the intention to drink responsibly or abstain among
college students who binge drink. This predictive model may prove valuable in the
design of interventions aiming to improve responsible drinking behavior in this
population.

inge drinking is defined as a pattern of drink-
ing that raises a person’s blood alcohol level
to 0.08% or above per 100 g of blood.1,2
Binge drinking occurs when within a 2-hour time
frame, women consume at least 4 drinks and men
consume at least 5 drinks.3 The Substance Abuse and
Mental Health Services Administration, responsible for
conducting the annual National Survey on Drug Use
and Health, classifies binge drinking as “5 or more
alcoholic drinks for males or 4 or more alcoholic
drinks for females on the same occasion (ie, at the
same time or within a couple of hours of each other)
on at least 1 day in the past month.”4
According to a national survey by the National
Institute of Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, the preva-
lence of binge drinking among college students aged
18 to 24 years is about 40%, or 2 of every 5 students.5
About 60% of college students in this age bracket
reported drinking alcohol within the past month. Binge
drinking in college students is associated with adverse
repercussions that may cause a strain on their intellec-
tual, family, and social lives. Missed lectures, poor aca-
demic consequences, suicide attempts, unsafe sex
practices, property damage, altercation with law
enforcement, and driving under the influence of
alcohol are potential consequences of binge drinking
among college students.5-7
According to the US Dietary Guidelines for
Americans 2015-2020,8 responsible drinking entails no
more than 2 drinks per day for men and 1 drink per day
for women. A typical standard drink in the United
States is about 14 g of alcohol. This quantity can be
found in 5 ounces of wine (12% alcohol), 12 ounces
of beer (5% alcohol), and 1.5 ounces of distilled
spirits (40% alcohol).3 However, variations occur
when a standard drink has been mixed with other
types of alcohol, which leads to inaccurate alcohol per-
centage interpretations.5 By law, abstinence is manda-
tory for persons younger than 21 years.
Various brief motivational intervention studies con-
ducted during the past 10 years have addressed the indi-
vidual and environmental causative factors of persistent
binge drinking among college students in an effort to
promote
responsible
drinking
or
abstinence.9-11
However, the effects of these interventions are short
lived.12-14 Research into individual-level interventions
targeting college students to create awareness of binge
drinking and alter students’ knowledge, attitudes, and
behaviors related to alcohol abuse aim to reduce the nega-
tive consequences of binge drinking. Individual-level
interventions use 1 or a combination of multiple behavioral
interventions, such as face-to-face and web-based health
education and awareness programs and cognitive-
behavioral skill-based approaches.5,15-18 Ecological-
level strategies include changing the environmental
conditions that lead to binge drinking.5,19-22
To alter binge drinking behavior in college students,
several behavioral theories have been identified in the
literature, including the health belief model,23,24
Bandura’s social cognitive theory,25 transtheoretical
model,10,23 theory of planned behavior,23 precaution
adoption process model,23 and social ecological
model.26 However, among the aforementioned studies,
there is a deficiency of robust theoretical models dir-
ectly applicable to altering binge-drinking behavior in
college students for the long term. This gap in interven-
tion research highlights the need for newer theories that
tackle multilevel behavioral factors related to binge
drinking, especially those theories that effect long-term
behavioral changes. The purpose of the current study
was to apply the multitheory model (MTM)27 of
health behavior change to predict intention to change
from binge drinking to responsible drinking/abstinence
among a sample of college students drawn from a uni-
versity in the southern United States.
Methods
After institutional review board approval, students were
recruited via email and directed to a link to an
MTM-based online questionnaire upon agreement to
participate in the study. Responses were collected
during a 3-week period, with reminder emails sent at
the start of September 2017 and again at the second

 and third weeks. Undergraduate and graduate students
who reported binge drinking (per National Institute of
Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism guidelines) within the
past 30 days and were aged 18 years or older were
included in the study.
MTM of Health Behavior Change
The MTM health behavior theory uses a combination
of evidence-based proven constructs from previous the-
ories to address behavioral change at multifaceted
levels of change settings.27 Attempting to be parsimo-
nious, the MTM avoids overlap among constructs,
addresses both immediate and long-term behavior
change, attempts to be culturally feasible, and is appro-
priate for intervention settings with limited resources.27
The model represents a 2-component health behavior
change pattern: initiation of behavior change and sus-
tenance of behavior change. To address binge drinking
among college students, initiation of behavior change
begins with the decision to abstain from drinking, quit
binge
drinking,
or
start
drinking
responsibly.
Sustenance of behavior change would involve the
ability to completely abstain or continue efforts to prac-
tice responsible drinking.27
For initiation of responsible drinking from binge
drinking according to the MTM, the following con-
structs are important: (1) participatory dialogue in
which advantages supersede disadvantages; (2) behav-
ioral confidence that can be internal or external and aim
to affect future behavior; and (3) changes in the physical
environment that entail removing or reducing exposure
to alcohol in the immediate environment. For sustaining
or maintaining the behavior change of responsible drink-
ing from binge drinking according to the MTM, the fol-
lowing
constructs
are
necessary:
(1)
emotional
transformation in which the person is able to use his or
her emotions in setting goals toward responsible drink-
ing; (2) practice for change that entails constant reflec-
tion on the need for responsible drinking, and (3)
changes in the social environment that necessitate help
from family and friends to continue with responsible
drinking. The utility of the MTM has been shown to be
effective in previous studies with other health behaviors,
such as physical activity,28 adequate sleep,29 portion size
consumption,30
water
consumption
instead
of
sugar-sweetened beverages,31 and fruit and vegetable
consumption.32 However, to our knowledge, this is the
first study to test the predictive ability of the MTM in
explaining behavior change from binge drinking to
responsible drinking.
Design
To assess the utility of the MTM in predicting initiation
and sustenance of responsible drinking/abstinence beha-
viors, a cross-sectional design was used. Sample size for
hierarchical regression modeling for R2 increase was cal-
culated using G*Power (Heinrich-Heine-Universität
Düsseldorf). An α of .05, a power of .80, 3 demographic
predictors (gender, race, and work status), 3 predictors in
each of the initiation and sustenance model, and an esti-
mated effect size of 0.05 (small to medium) yielded a
sample size of 223 participants. Therefore, we deter-
mined that a sample size in the vicinity of 200 partici-
pants would suffice for this study even if the effect
sizes were small. This sample size was also adequate
for confirmatory factor analysis.33,34
Instrumentation
The 39-item MTM-based survey was used to predict
intention to change from binge drinking to responsible
drinking/abstinence. Responsible drinking was defined
as drinking 1 or 2 alcoholic beverages on a single occa-
sion or drinking at most 1 alcoholic beverage per day
for women and 2 per day for men. Abstinence was
defined as not drinking alcoholic beverages at all.
The first 2 items assessed study eligibility, and
the subsequent 8 items assessed sociodemographic
characteristics: age, gender, race, class level, work
status, age at first alcohol consumption, alcoholic
drinks consumed in the past 30 days, and living
arrangements (on or off campus). The remaining 29
items measured the MTM constructs for initiation and
sustenance. Answers used 5-point Likert scales from 0
to 4, defined according to section.

 Initiation Measures
The advantages of participatory dialogue were assessed
with 5 survey items (10-14) representing the possible
effects of drinking responsibly or abstaining from alcohol
(ie, “be healthy,” “save money,” “not get into trouble,”
“have better relationships,” and “do well academically”).
Each item was scored on a scale of 0 (never) to 4
(always), and responses to all items in the section were
summed for a maximum possible score of 20.
Five items (15-19) measured perceived disadvan-
tages of participatory dialogue. For example, “If you
abstain from alcohol or drink responsibly you will …
‘not be able to socialize well.’” These items were
scored from 0 (never) to 4 (always), with a maximum
possible score of 20. The total score for disadvantages
was subtracted from the total score for advantages to
give an overall score for the participatory dialogue
construct.
The next 5 items (20-24) assessed the construct of
behavioral confidence, with participants being asked
about certainty regarding their ability to drink respon-
sibly or abstain from alcohol. For example, “How sure
are you that you will be able to abstain from alcohol or
drink
responsibly…‘this
week
without
getting
anxious?’” Each item was scored on a scale from 0
(not at all sure) to 4 (completely sure), with a
maximum possible score of 20.
Three items (25-27) gauged changes in physical
environment, which asked about participants’ confi-
dence in their ability to create an alcohol-free physical
environment (ie, “how sure are you that you will… ‘be
able to get rid of alcohol from your home environment
this week,’ ‘not buy any alcohol this week,’ and ‘be
able to replace drinking with something else this
week’”). Each item was scored on a scale from 0 (not
at all sure) to 4 (completely sure), with a maximum pos-
sible score of 12.
Initiation of behavior change was assessed with a
single question (37) asking, “How likely is it that you
will abstain from alcohol or drink responsibly in the
upcoming week?” Possible scores ranged from 0 (not
at all sure) to 4 (completely sure) units.
Sustenance Measures
Three items (28-30) assessed the first component of the
sustenance model, emotional transformation. For
example, “How sure are you that you can…‘motivate
yourself to be alcohol free or drink responsibly every
week?’” Response options were scored from 0 (not at
all sure) to 4 (completely sure), with a maximum pos-
sible score of 12.
Items 31 to 33 measured practice for change. For
example, “How sure are you that you can…‘keep a self-
diary to monitor your alcohol drinking desire every
week?’” Responses for each item were scored from 0
(not at all sure) to 4 (completely sure), with a
maximum possible score of 12.
Changes in social environment were measured in
items 34 to 36, which assessed participants’ certainty
in their ability to get the help of someone to support
their responsible drinking/abstinence. For example,
“How sure are you that you can get the help of
a…’family member to support you in being alcohol
free or drinking responsibly every week?’” Possible
responses ranged from 0 (not at all sure) to 4 (com-
pletely sure), with a maximum possible score of 12.
Sustenance was assessed with 1 item (38) asking:
“How likely is it that you will abstain from alcohol or
drink responsibly every week from now on?” The pos-
sible item score ranged from 0 (not at all sure) to 4
(completely sure) units.
Validity and Reliability
Six experts were invited to establish face and content
validity of the survey instrument. Confirmatory factor
analysis using the maximum likelihood method was
performed to establish construct validity. The survey
instrument’s internal consistency reliability was calcu-
lated with the Cronbach α.
Statistical Analyses
Data were analyzed using IBM SPSS statistical soft-
ware version 22.0. Descriptive statistics were calculated
for all measured variables. Pearson product-moment
correlation was used for continuous demographic

 variables, and analysis of variance was used for cat-
egorical demographic variables. Both dependent vari-
ables (intention to initiate and sustain responsible
drinking/abstinence behaviors) were measured on a
continuous scale. Statistical significance level of .05
was set a priori for all analyses. The following analyses
were carried out to determine the utility of MTM in pre-
dicting intention to initiate and sustain responsible
drinking/abstinence behaviors.
1. After assessing statistically significant demo-
graphic covariates (gender, race/ethnicity, and work)
for the initiation model (model 1), we conducted hier-
archical multiple regression to determine the relation-
ship between independent variables (participatory
dialogue, behavioral confidence, changes in physical
environment) and intention to initiate responsible
drinking/abstinence behaviors after adjusting for demo-
graphic covariates. In block 1, significant demographic
covariates were entered, and in block 2, MTM con-
structs were entered.
2. After determining statistically significant demo-
graphic covariates (gender, race/ethnicity, and work)
for the sustenance model (model 2), we performed hier-
archical multiple regression to assess the relationship
between independent variables (MTM constructs) and
intention to sustain responsible drinking/abstinence
behaviors after adjusting for demographic covariates.
In block 1, significant demographic covariates were
entered, and in block 2, MTM constructs were entered.
Results
A total of 5000 students received the survey. Of the
735 students who completed the survey, 289 met the
inclusion criteria (age >18 years and binge drank in
the past 30 days). The majority of participants were
white (247 [87.6%]), and gender distribution was
nearly even between men (136 [48.1%]) and women
(147 [51.9%]). Study participants had a mean (SD)
age of 21.4 (5.3) years, and the majority were under-
graduates (239 [85.7%]). A total of 176 (63%)
worked, and 101 (36.5%) did not work (Table 1).
Participants estimated that on average they consumed a
mean (SD) of 34.3 (31.5) (range, 2-150) drinks in the
past 30 days. The mean (SD) age of participants when
they had first consumed alcohol was 15.6 (2.7) years.

mean (SD) total score on participatory dialogue was
6.9 (6.8). The mean (SD) score of behavioral confi-
dence was 13.3 (5.8) and changes in physical environ-
ment was 6.8 (4.1). The mean scores of the sustenance
model constructs were also in the middle of the range.
The Cronbach α of the scale and the subscales ranged
from 0.8 to 0.9 and demonstrated acceptable internal
consistency reliability (ie, ≥0.7). Construct validity
using confirmatory factor analysis yielded 1-factor solu-
tions for each of the subscales. The criteria of factor
loadings over 0.3 (all factor loadings >0.5) and eigen
values over 1.0 yielding 1-factor solution were met for
all subscales.

city (P=.004), behavioral confidence (P=.029), and
changes in physical environment (P=.001) were asso-
ciated with intention to initiate responsible drinking/

Discussion
The purpose of this study was to provide a robust theor-
etical model that could be used to predict intention to
change from binge drinking to responsible drinking/
abstinence in the college student population. An
evidence-based and effective predictive model may
prove valuable in the design of interventions aiming to
improve responsible drinking behavior in this popula-
tion. The MTM is a novel and well-supported theory
that incorporates tenets of other commonly used
models in public health to address 2 primary constructs:
initiation of health behavior change and sustenance of
health behavior change.
Pertinent conclusions of data analyses showed that of
the constructs proposed for initiation of responsible
drinking/abstinence—behavioral
confidence
and
changes in physical environment—were significant
and that the full model predicted 26.4% of the variance
in the intention to initiate responsible drinking/abstin-
ence, a substantial value for a behavioral study. The
construct of behavioral confidence in the MTM is
based on well-established principles in the field of
public health: Bandura’s self-efficacy construct35 and
Ajzen’s perceived behavioral control.36 Similar to the
study by Wrye and Pruitt,25 behavioral confidence is
well-supported in this study as a significant predictor
of responsible drinking behavior and a potential point
of focus in interventions.36 Another potential point of
focus to most effectively influence responsible drinking
behavior in this population, based on the results of this
study, is changes in physical environment. Derived
from Bandura’s environmental construct35 and several
other well-established theoretical models in public
health,37,38 this construct involves altering the conveni-
ence, availability, and readiness of resources.39 The role

 of physical environment is also supported by the work
of McBride et al,40 who studied the role of fraternities
and sororities in the initiation of binge drinking.
Among sustenance model constructs, practice for
change was found to be a significant predictor for inten-
tion to sustain responsible drinking/abstinence. Derived
from Freire’s adult education model praxis, practice for
change entails active reflection and reflective action.41
Embodiment of this construct involves consistent
thought about one’s behavior change, actively correct-
ing one’s strategy, overcoming barriers, and remaining
focused on the behavior change goal. Application of
this construct in the design of health behavior interven-
tions and clinical practice may prove effective in sus-
taining responsible drinking behavior in the college
student population.
The results of the current study also show that gender
and race are significant predictors of both initiation and
sustenance of responsible drinking/abstinence. Women
were found to be significantly more likely to initiate
and sustain responsible drinking behavior than men. A
large-scale survey study by Wilsnack et al42 found that
long-term abstention from alcohol was definitively
more prevalent among women. That study also found
that of former drinkers, women were more likely to
have stopped drinking and practiced abstinence than
men. Male drinkers also have been shown to be at
greater risk than female drinkers for developing
alcohol use disorders.43 In the design of interventions,
group or individualized, it is recommended to allocate
more time and understand the greater effort required to
initiate and sustain responsible drinking behavior in
college-aged men who binge drink. Nonwhite race/
ethnicity was also found to significantly predict
likelihood of initiation and sustenance of responsible
drinking behavior among binge drinkers. This finding
is supported by previous studies that showed greater
alcohol consumption rates among whites.44,45 The gen-
eralizability of this result is limited, however, as the
majority of respondents in the current study were

 white, with just 35 of 283 participants reporting non-
white race/ethnicity.
The descriptive data on study variables generally
showed the mean scores on the constructs to be either
on the lower side of the range or in the middle of the
range. This factor signifies that there is scope for
further improvement of the construct scores through
interventions designed to modify these constructs.
Implications for Practice
With the high prevalence of binge drinking—2 of every
5 students2 among the college-aged demographic binge
drink—and the harmful effects associated with binge
drinking in this population, interventions are clearly
necessary. In the field of public health, such interven-
tions are often designed and planned with evidence-
based, behavioral models at their foundation. Such
interventions can be implemented by primary care phy-
sicians, college wellness programs, and other health
care professionals.
The MTM offers the advantage of brief and precise
interventions by way of leveraging the significant con-
structs of the model after empirical testing. These tar-
geted constructs are nonoverlapping and free of
moderating variables, which allow for relatively
straightforward application in interventions across
health behaviors. With the incorporation of constructs
devoted to understanding the drivers for sustenance,
the MTM also has the potential to effect long-term
changes in behavior. Although longitudinal studies
have not been performed, the results of MTM studies
across multiple health behaviors are promising for
their utility in maintenance of behavior change.28-32
After identification of a negative health behavior and
recognition of the harmful ramifications of such beha-
viors, the next step for public health professionals—
particularly behavioral and social scientists involved in
public health intervention design—and health care pro-
fessionals should be to better understand the afflicted
population with regard to the positive health behavior
change; understanding the negative impact of a health
behavior is not sufficient—the specific individual or
population in question must also be investigated to
gauge their potential responsiveness to behavioral inter-
ventions. However, in the primary care setting, time
with the patient is limited, and time to motivate patients
regarding health behavior change is even more so.
With the majority of osteopathic physicians practicing
in primary care,46 it is worthwhile to research the most
efficient and effective constructs for osteopathic physi-
cians to use to improve health behavior in their patients.
An evidence base to guide clinical practice should be
applied to health behavior change as it is to drug
dosing schedules. This study proposes the value of the
MTM as an evidence-based model to provide the pre-
dictive empirical framework for the design of large-scale
interventions, as well as guidance for individual-scale
interventions in clinical practice. Multiple constructs
were identified in the current study as significantly
predictive and therefore suitable for the planning and
execution of interventions for this population.
To initiate responsible drinking/abstinence, the
current study found that the constructs of behavioral
confidence and changes in physical environment were
significant. Teaching responsible drinking in manage-
able small steps and aiding students to develop behav-
ioral confidence in their ability to drink responsibility
should be one area of emphasis. This aspect could
entail educating patients on the responsible number of
drinks to consume per hour and empowering them
with strategies to maintain that responsibility. A core
principle of the behavioral confidence construct is that
the source of confidence is not restricted to self but is
also external. Physicians could advise at-risk patients
to educate an influential individual close to them to
foster shared accountability. Patients could be given an
infographic or refrigerator magnet that clearly outlines
the responsible rate of alcohol consumption, serving as
an external motivating reminder. Physicians could also
advise patients to keep an alarm on their phone to main-
tain appropriate intervals between drinks and make an
active effort to keep track of the number of drinks con-
sumed. Another point of emphasis should be changes
in physical environment. The current study found that

 college students have low certainty in their ability to
remove alcohol from their home environment, not buy
alcohol throughout the week, or to replace drinking
with something else. Physicians could advise their
patients to abstain from “stocking up” on alcohol and
purchase small amounts as needed. Patients could be
advised to seek housing options that are not proximal
to liquor stores and to remove alcohol from their
homes during the week. Emphasizing the importance
of seeking activities that do not involve drinking could
also prove fruitful. Educating at-risk patients about the
significant impact that changing their physical environ-
ment has on their ability to drink responsibly/abstain
should be a point of emphasis.
To sustain responsible drinking/abstinence behavior
using the MTM, practice for change was the key con-
struct found to be statistically significant. Patients
could be advised to keep a journal that records their
drinking behavior, engage in introspection of their
behaviors, and identify barriers and ways to overcome
them to sustain responsible drinking. The core of this
construct is active reflection, and health care profes-
sionals and college wellness programs should focus
efforts on improving patients’ macroscopic self-
awareness of drinking behaviors. Survey scoring on
this particular construct was lower than all other mea-
sured constructs, indicating room for improvement
through focused intervention or counseling.
Limitations
The cross-sectional design of this study limits the tem-
poral conclusions that can be drawn from the results.
Therefore, it cannot be explicitly said that the MTM con-
structs precede responsible drinking behavior. However,
the theories and models that the MTM is derived from
indicate that environmental and attitudinal constructs
come before health behavior change.34 More robust lon-
gitudinal and experimental study designs could be exe-
cuted in future studies. Other possible limitations were
that the majority of the participants were white, and
data were collected at 1 southern US university. Thus,
caution must be exercised when generalizing these
findings to all college students. Furthermore, for the
sake of feasibility, proxies for intention and sustenance
behavior were measured rather than actual behavior.
Future studies could look into finding more objective
measures of behavior. Additionally, although choices
were limited for attitudinal assessments, this was a self-
reported survey study, and, therefore, measurement bias
and false reporting are potential confounders. Stability
testing (test-retest) reliability of the survey instrument
was not performed—future studies replicating this work
should include reliability assessments.
Conclusion
Associated with a 6-fold poorer performance in aca-
demic examinations, unsafe sex practices, property
damage, and driving under the influence of alcohol,
binge drinking in college students is a widely prevalent
concern.5 Physicians, especially primary care physi-
cians, are best equipped to guide intervention design
and clinical practice with the college student population
regarding change from binge drinking to responsible
drinking/abstinence. This study provides empirical jus-
tification for MTM constructs that may lead to targeted
interventions. Behavioral confidence and changes in
physical environment should be the point of focus to
initiate responsible drinking/abstinence and practice
for change to sustain the behavior.
