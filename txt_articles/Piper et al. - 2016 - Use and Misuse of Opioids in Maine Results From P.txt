ABSTRACT. Objective: Although opioids have substantial efficacy
for acute pain management, escalation to opioid misuse and abuse is a
persistent concern. This report assesses the current status of the opioid
epidemic in Maine using three complementary data sets. Method: A
representative sample of pharmacists (N = 275) completed an online
survey regarding the extent that opioids affected their practice. A county-
level analysis of opioid prescriptions (N = 1.22 million) reported to the
Maine Prescription Monitoring Program (M-PMP) in 2014 and the
agents implicated in arrests as reported to the Maine Diversion Alert
Program (DAP
, N = 2,700) in 2014/15 also was completed. Results: A
significantly greater number of pharmacists agreed that opioid misuse
(85.9%), rather than diversion (76.8%) or access (54.2%), was a concern.
Only half (56.2%) reported use of the M-PMP
. Opioids were dispensed
to 22.4% of residents (37.7% of women in their 80s). This was enough
to supply everyone in Maine with a 16.1-day supply. Buprenorphine ac-
counted for almost half of opioid prescriptions to young adults (46.3%
women, 49.3% men). Arrests increased by 13.3% from 2014 to 2015,
and the proportion of arrests that involved prescription opioids decreased
while those involving stimulants and heroin were elevated. Conclusions:
Pharmacists are very aware of the potential for opioid misuse, but many
do not consistently use the M-PMP
. There continues to be substantial
legitimate use, as well as criminal activity, involving oxycodone and
other prescription opioids. Continued vigilance and use of tools like the
PMP and DAP are necessary to minimize nonmedical use of opioids in
Maine. (J. Stud. Alcohol Drugs, 77, 556–565, 2016)

T
HE PRONOUNCED INCREASE IN OVERDOSE
deaths involving opioid analgesics (which exceeded
those from heroin and cocaine, combined) prompted the
U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to classify
prescription drug overdoses as an epidemic (Paulozzi et al.,
2012). Unfortunately, Maine (Alexander et al., 2004; Brown
et al. 2015; Grau et al., 2007; Heimer et al., 2012; Martin &
Rocque, 2011; McCall et al., 2013; Roche, 2000; Rosenberg,
2002; Sorg & Greenwald, 2003) has played a prominent
role in this national opioid epidemic (Center for Behavioral
Health Statistics and Quality, 2015; Johnston et al., 2015;
Maxwell, 2011; Patrick et al., 2015; Paul et al., 2014; War-
ner et al., 2011). The total daily opioid dose in morphine
equivalents in the United States was highest in Maine (798
mg/person), which was approximately fourfold higher than
that in the lowest state. Further, there was a strong associa-
tion between the volume of opioid sales and drug poisoning
mortality rates (r = .73) (Paulozzi & Ryan, 2006). Maine
was ranked highest in the United States in 2012 for prescrib-
ing long-acting/extended-release opioids (Paulozzi et al.,
2014). Opioids including heroin, methadone, oxycodone,
fentanyl, and hydrocodone accounted for half of the top 10
drugs mentioned on Maine death certificates as a cause of
drug-related mortality (Sorg & Greenwald, 2003). Overall,
nonmedical use of opioids continues to impose a substantial
burden on the health care, economic, and criminal justice
systems (Joranson & Gilson, 2005; Maxwell, 2011; Smith
et al., 2009).
Many interventions have been implemented nationally or
at a state level to limit prescription opioid misuse (Haegerich
et al., 2014), including increasing the accessibility to opioid

antagonists (Wermeling, 2015), changing clinical guidelines,
the development of abuse-resistant opioids (Larochelle et al.
2015), expanding needle-sharing programs, identification of
inappropriate prescribing by insurers and pharmacy benefit
managers, improved patient and provider education, fining
pharmacy chains and revoking the license to dispense con-
trolled substances of stores that failed to prevent diversion
(Meier, 2013), passing laws to better regulate so-called pill
mills and decrease use of multiple prescribers (i.e., “doctor
shopping”), and Prescription (Drug) Monitoring Programs
(McCall et al., 2013). The Maine Prescription Monitoring
Program (M-PMP) has been recording prescriptions of
Schedule II, III, and IV substances since 2004. The majority
(>85%) of licensed medical doctors, doctors of osteopathy,
dentists, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants had reg-
istered to search the M-PMP by December 2013 compared
with a minority (39%) of pharmacists. This is unfortunate,
as pharmacists also share responsibility for ensuring the safe
use of controlled substances.
Maine is currently the only state in the country with a
Diversion Alert Program (DAP). The DAP is an electronic
resource launched statewide in 2013 that allows health care
providers to identify patients charged with drug-related
crimes, including illegal possession and diversion of pre-
scription drugs. This informational tool aids prescribers and
dispensers in determining if a patient is likely to misuse or
divert prescription medications. Unfortunately, less than one
third of actively licensed prescribers and dispensers in Maine
are registered with the DAP
.
Resources like the DAP may be of increasing value be-
cause some prescription opioids may be less abuse resistant
than was previously thought (Conrad et al., 2015). Impor-
tantly, there are commercial websites that collect informa-
tion from federal, state, and local governments about drug
arrests, charging a fee for that data (e.g., publicdata.com).
However, DAP has the advantage of being nonproprietary,
with a focus on improving patient care, patient outcomes,
and communities as a whole. Finally, DAP has established
relationships with the Maine Drug Enforcement Agency,
state police, and various municipalities, working with law
enforcement to provide an effective solution to address pre-
scription drug abuse and diversion.
Given the persistence of nonmedical opioid misuse over
the past two decades, the objective of this report was to
provide an updated appraisal on this issue in Maine using
three complementary sources: a survey of pharmacists, the
M-PMP
, and the DAP
. More specifically, the objectives were
to use the mixed-methods approach to (a) describe practic-
ing pharmacists’ beliefs regarding the misuse and diversion
of opioids and their use of the M-PMP; (b) characterize
the prevalence of opioid use relative to other controlled
substance use according to the M-PMP; and (c) evaluate
patterns of arrests involving opioids, with an emphasis on
Schedule II prescription agents (e.g., oxycodone, hydro-
codone, methadone) as well as heroin and other drugs as
assessed by the DAP
.
Method
Participants
Survey respondents (N = 275, 48.7% female) included
40.5% with a doctor of pharmacy (Pharm.D.) degree. Their
primary practice settings varied, with the largest subset
working at a large retail chain (41.5%), an inpatient/hospital
environment (22.9%), or an independent pharmacy (15.3%).
Two fifths (41.0%) had practiced for more than 25 years.
All procedures including the consent were approved by the
Institutional Review Board of Husson University.
Procedure
All pharmacists with a Maine Board of Pharmacy license
(N = 1,262) were emailed a SurveyMonkey link in the fall
of 2014. A $5 gas card was offered as an incentive. Partici-
pants were asked, “To what extent do you agree or disagree
that the following are challenges to your practice?” with
specific items including misuse, diversion, store security,
and patient access to legitimate use as assessed by a Likert
scale (strongly disagree to strongly agree). Similarly, a rat-
ing of M-PMP use (In my practice, we use the PMP all the
time) and M-PMP favorability (I have a favorable opinion of
the PMP) was determined. Results from other (non-opioid)
items were presented elsewhere (Martin et al., 2015; Supple-
mental Materials).
The M-PMP is administered by the Maine Department of
Health and Human Services and collects Schedule II–IV data
for all new and refill prescriptions. Information provided
included patient age, sex, county of residence, the agent
dispensed, and drug quantity (McCall et al., 2013).
Law enforcement agencies in Maine submit arrest records
to DAP
. This includes sex, community of residence, drug of-
fense, and drug(s) involved in the offense. De-identified ar-
rest data for the first complete year that DAP was operational
(2014), as well as the first quarter of 2015, were analyzed. It
is important to note that for marijuana-related drug charges,
only nonpossession charges (i.e., trafficking, furnishing) are
collected. Marijuana possession is not collected because of
the ambiguities associated with medical marijuana.
Statistics
Two complementary analyses were completed on opioid
and M-PMP ratings with Systat,Version 13.1 (San Jose, CA):
nonparametric with the percent that agreed/strongly agreed
combined, and parametric using the mean on the six-point
scale. The state of Maine is divided into 16 counties (Supple-
mental Figure 1). For M-PMP analyses, several prescription
 558
JOURNAL OF STUDIES ON ALCOHOL AND DRUGS / JULY 2016
endpoints were examined at a county level including percent-
age prescribed; prescriptions per capita; medication units,
which includes pills, capsules, patches, etc.; and the number
of days’ supply. As buprenorphine is available in different
formulations (buprenorphine hydrochloride vs. buprenorphine
with naloxone), these were listed separately.
The data for the population of Maine by age, sex, and
county were based on the 2010 census. Age differences in
opioid data were expressed two ways—as the number of
unique recipients divided by the number of Mainers for
each age and sex. An additional analysis was completed with
frequencies divided by the total number of each prescription
endpoint, by age expressed in decades, in order to facilitate
comparison across measures. Drug offenses were catego-
rized as (a) possession, including possession with intent to
distribute; (b) trafficking, including aggravated trafficking
and trafficking in prison contraband; and (c) other, which
includes conspiracy to distribute, furnishing, and stealing.
A population-corrected arrest measure was calculated as
the percent of all reported arrests minus the percent of the
state population in each county. The then-present (May 1,
2015) federal Drug Enforcement Agency Schedule of each
drug (i.e., hydrocodone is currently a Schedule II drug) was
determined for those reported to the DAP
. Variability was
expressed as the standard error of the mean.
Results
Survey of pharmacists
Participants (N = 275, a 21.8% response rate; 48.7%
female) were representative of licensed pharmacists in the
state (46.3%) in terms of gender (p = .46). The majority of
pharmacists believed that opioids were a challenge in their
practice. As also reported previously (Martin et al., 2015),
more respondents strongly agreed or agreed that misuse
(85.9%)—rather than diversion (76.8%, p < .01), access
(54.2%, p ≤ .0001), or security (53.0%)—was a concern,
χ2(1) = 65.63, p ≤ .0001. Diversion was rated less highly by
respondents with a Pharm.D. (4.8 + 0.1) than by those with
a bachelor’s degree (5.2 + 0.1), t(264) = 2.31, p < .05, d =
0.28.The vast majority of Pharm.D.-educated pharmacists had
been practicing for less than 15 years (92.9%), which is very
unlike their bachelor’s-level colleagues (7.1%, p ≤ .0005).
More respondents agreed that they have a favorable
opinion of the M-PMP (75.3%) than reported using this pro-
gram (56.2%, p < .0001). Pharmacists with a Pharm.D. had
a slightly more favorable rating of the M-PMP (5.1 ± 0.1)
than their bachelor’s-educated colleagues (4.8 ± 0.1), t(242)
= 1.93, p = .055. Further, Pharm.D.’s (4.6 ± 0.1) were more
likely than bachelor’s-level practitioners to use the M-PMP
(4.2 ± 0.1), t(259) = 2.23, p < .05, d = 0.28. Pharmacists
who worked in a hospital setting were less likely to use the
M-PMP (3.7 ± 0.2) than those who were employed in a large
retail environment (4.7 ± 0.1), t(80.5) = 4.22, p < .0005, d =
0.74, or private retail environment (4.6 ± 0.2), t(91) = 2.92, p
< .005, d = 0.62. Concern about opioid misuse was slightly,
albeit significantly, associated with M-PMP use, r(258) =
.20, p < .001.
Maine Prescription Monitoring Program
More than three quarters of opioid prescriptions were
for Schedule II agents (77.3%), followed by Schedule III
(16.6%) and Schedule IV (6.1%) drugs. Figure 1A shows
that three agents (hydrocodone, oxycodone, buprenorphine/
naloxone) accounted for the preponderance (73.8%) of opi-
oid prescriptions. Within hydrocodone prescriptions, almost
all were for hydrocodone/acetaminophen (99.2%), with
the remainder for hydrocodone/ibuprofen or hydrocodone
bitartrate. Among benzodiazepines, three drugs, lorazepam
(33.4%), clonazepam (28.3%), and alprazolam (20.9%),
accounted for the vast majority (82.6%) of prescriptions
(Supplemental Figure 2A). Among stimulants, almost half
were for methylphenidate (45.8%), one third for dextroam-
phetamine (34.1%), and only one fifth for lisdexamfetamine
(20.1%), an abuse-deterrent agent (Supplemental Figure 2B).
There were 1.22 million opioid prescriptions to 291,440
recipients. Therefore, more than one fifth (21.9%) of the
state’s population received an opioid in 2014. Benzodiaz-
epine (0.65 million) and stimulant (0.40 million) prescrip-
tions were less common. There were also pronounced age
differences. Figure 1B shows the percentage of all Maine
residents, by age and sex, who received a prescription within
1 year for opioids, benzodiazepines, and stimulants. Sex dif-
ferences were most pronounced and consistently observed
for benzodiazepines, with women receiving more benzo-
diazepine prescriptions than men. More male children and
adolescents (ages 0–19) received a stimulant, although the
reverse pattern was evident at older ages. The percentage of
the Maine population that received an opioid from a retail
pharmacy increased markedly with age into the eighth and
ninth decades.
There were also pronounced age differences in the opioid
prescribed. Buprenorphine constituted almost half of all opi-
oids prescribed to young adults (ages 20–29), which is quite
unlike the pattern for patients in their 80s (Figure 2) or the
prescription pattern overall (Figure 1A). More specifically,
buprenorphine/naloxone accounted for 39.07% of all opioid
prescriptions for individuals in their 20s but was exceedingly
uncommon for octogenarians (0.02%, p < .0001). This robust
preference for prescribing buprenorphine to young adults
was independent of sex.
Additional age analyses were completed within opioid
prescriptions (i.e., using the total number of opioid prescrip-
tions, or other parameter, as the denominator). There was
evidence for an uncoupling of prescription parameters for
persons in their second and sixth decades. More specifically,
 PIPER ET AL.
559
teenagers account for 10.8% of Maine’s population but only
5.2% of opioid recipients, 1.0% of opioid units, and 0.6% by
duration. Conversely, patients in their 50s account for about
one sixth (16.1%) of Maine’s population but almost one fifth
(19.8%) of all opioid recipients and an even larger portion
(29.5%) of the units dispensed (Figure 1C). There was less
evidence for uncoupling for benzodiazepines (Supplemental
Figure 3A), and this was less pronounced for adolescents
(ages 10–19) receiving stimulants (Supplemental Figure 3B).
Table 1 extends these statewide results and compares
opioid with benzodiazepine and stimulant prescriptions at
a county level. Twice as many persons received opioids as
benzodiazepines and almost sixfold more than stimulants.
Other dispensing parameters showed the same ranking. In
contrast, the total days’ supply per person was only twice as
high for opioids as stimulants and only 23.8% longer than
benzodiazepines, which reflects that prescriptions for non-
opioids were typically for only moderately shorter intervals
when expressed on a per capita basis.
Diversion Alert Program
The first set of analyses examined arrests (N = 2,153) in
2014. Men (69.5%) accounted for more than twice the ar-
rests as women (30.5%). Possession accounted for a greater
proportion of arrests for women (women = 68.9%, men =
64.1%, p < .05), whereas trafficking accounted for more ar-
rests among men (men = 28.3%, women = 23.5%, p < .05).
More arrests (58.0%) involved Schedule II–IV agents
than Schedule I drugs (37.1%). The majority of arrests listed
only a single drug (84.1%). Among these, opioids accounted
for more than half (50.4%), followed by stimulants (27.7%),
benzodiazepines (5.8%), bath salts (4.9%), cannabinoids
(4.6%), and others (6.6%). Among opioids, oxycodone
(26.3%), buprenorphine/naloxone (15.1%), and hydrocodone
(6.4%) together (47.8%) were listed for slightly more arrests
than heroin (46.9%). Cocaine and crack cocaine were re-
sponsible for more than half of the stimulant arrests (60.2%),
followed by methamphetamine (23.6%) and amphetamine
(7.3%). For cannabinoids, the preponderance of arrests were
for marijuana (77.5%) and hashish (12.7%). Within benzo-
diazepines, clonazepam (45.4%) and alprazolam (37.1%)
accounted for sizable proportions followed by diazepam
(8.2%) and lorazepam (8.2%). Among arrests involving two
or more drugs, opioids were listed in the majority (71.7%)
and specifically heroin in more than one third (34.5%).
Figure 3A shows that some counties in the southern half
of the state (i.e., the more densely populated region) were
overrepresented for arrests relative to their population.
Southern counties of Y
ork and Kennebec also had the low-
est number of arrests. Individual counties had pronounced
differences in specific drug classes. For example, bath salts
accounted for only 0.4% of arrests in Cumberland but 31.4%
in Aroostook (p < .0001). The most common single Schedule

is listed in parentheses. The buprenorphine slice includes buprenorphine hydrochloride/naloxone hydrochloride and buprenorphine hydrochloride.
I agent was heroin in the preponderance (87.5%) of counties.
Oxycodone was the most prevalent Schedule II drug in less
than half (43.8%) of counties, followed by methamphetamine
in one quarter (25.0%, Supplementary Table 1). A map of
Schedule II opioid arrests shows highest levels in Augusta,
Bangor, Portland, and Rockland (Supplemental Figure 4).
Associations between the M-PMP and DAP were evalu-
ated at a county level. Counties with more opioid recipients
also had more arrests for offenses involving Schedule II
drugs, both uncorrected, r(14) = .63, p < .01, and corrected,
r(14) = .63, p < .01, for population size. Similarly, coun-
ties with a higher volume of opioid prescriptions had more
Schedule II drug arrests when the correlation was uncor-
rected, r(14) = .63, p < .01, and corrected, r(14) = .52, p <
.05, for population (Supplemental Figure 5).
The second analyses evaluated whether there were any
changes in recent arrests by comparing the first quarter of
2015 with the first quarter of the preceding year. The number
of arrests increased by 13.3%, although arrests involving
two or more agents decreased (16.5% to 12.0%, p < .05).
Figure 3B shows dynamic changes in arrests, with arrests
involving heroin (p < .05)—as well as stimulants (p <
.0001)—increased whereas those involving Schedule II opi-
oids decreased (p ≤ .0001). Further, benzodiazepine arrests
also decreased (8.2% to 4.5%, p < .05), whereas cannabinoid
arrests essentially remained stable (2.6% to 2.9%).
Discussion
These three complementary data sets provide a thorough
update on the evolving opioid epidemic in Maine. The on-
line survey revealed that practicing pharmacists in Maine
are very aware of the potential for opioids to be misused
for nonmedical purposes. Similarly, the preponderance
(87.5%) of community pharmacists in Tennessee believed
that opioid pain reliever abuse was a problem in their prac-
tice. Further, the Tennessee sample indicated that less than
one fifth of prescribers or dispensers spent adequate time
communicating with patients about the abuse potential of
opioids (Hagemeier et al., 2014). Although the majority of
Maine pharmacists indicated that opioid diversion, access,
and security were issues, these were rated significantly lower
than misuse. Possibly, given the spate of pharmacy robber-
ies over the past decade (Smith et al., 2009), with a 27-fold

increase from 2008 to 2012 in Maine (J. O’Malley, personal
communication, May 27, 2015), many pharmacies may have
already made improvements in security.
The training of pharmacists in the United States has
changed considerably during the last two decades. A 5-year
bachelor’s degree was sufficient to enter the field until the
late 1990s, when a doctor of pharmacy degree became
mandatory. Therefore, it is unclear whether the difference in
level of concern about opioid diversion between Pharm.D.’s
and bachelor’s-educated pharmacists is the result of less
experience as a practitioner (i.e., bachelor’s pharmacists
are more attuned to the needs of their communities) or that
more Pharm.D.’s received their training in the “pain as the
fifth vital sign” era. Conversely, a greater likelihood among
Pharm.D.’s of using the M-PMP could reflect that opioid
diversion receives greater attention in their education or it
could be the result of younger pharmacists having greater
technological sophistication with online resources. The find-
ing that hospital pharmacists were less likely than others to
use the M-PMP is not completely unexpected, as hospitals
are not required to input controlled substances into the M-
PMP
. This data gap is problematic, as some patients present
to the emergency department with lower back pain, claim an
allergy to non-opioids, and request specific opioids by name
(Weiner et al., 2015).
There were 332,500 M-PMP reports run on potential
patients in 2014, of which 14.7% were initiated by pharma-
cists (J. Lipovsky, personal communication, June 15, 2015).
Clearly, as less than half (39%) of Maine pharmacists are
even registered to run reports, there is substantial room for
improvement in M-PMP use. Insufficient time has been not-
ed by others as a very common barrier to PMP use by com-
munity pharmacists in Indiana (Norwood & Wright, 2016).
Only a limited number of pharmacy chains have required
PMP use. Another contributing factor is that pharmacists’
license renewal, unlike that of prescribers, is not currently
linked to PMP registration. There are also technical barriers
in that the PMP is Internet based whereas some pharmacy
 562
JOURNAL OF STUDIES ON ALCOHOL AND DRUGS / JULY 2016
systems rely on intranets because of security concerns. The
M-PMP could also be improved by automatically converting
the multiple opioids prescribed to single patients into mor-
phine equivalents, which would make this information more
useful for pharmacists.
The United States constitutes 4.6% of the world popula-
tion but consumes 56% of the world’
s morphine supply, 83%
of the oxycodone supply, and 99% of the hydrocodone sup-
ply (Calabresi, 2015; International Narcotics Control Board,
2009). Within Maine, the total number of opioid prescrip-
tions in 2014 was 8.8% higher than in 2006 but 3.5% lower
than in 2010 (McCall et al., 2013). However, comparisons
over time are complicated by the removal of propoxyphene
from the U.S. market in 2010, reclassifying tramadol from
unscheduled to Schedule IV in August 2014. Hydrocodone/
acetaminophen was the most prescribed agent from retail
pharmacies in the United States from 2007 until 2013 when
it was overtaken by levothyroxine (Aitken et al., 2015). The
present M-PMP findings that more than one fifth of the
Maine population received a prescription opioid is consistent
with and extends upon prior pharmacoepidemiological inves-
tigations (McCall et al., 2013; Paulozzi et al., 2014; Wright
et al., 2014b).
Interestingly, this report identified very similar prescrip-
tion frequencies for hydrocodone and oxycodone, which is
very unlike the national preference for hydrocodone (Aitken
et al., 2015). For example, hydrocodone was prescribed
sixfold more commonly (68.9% vs. 11.7% of all opioid
prescriptions) in Indiana (Wright et al., 2014b). Interest-
ingly, individual provinces in Canada also show pronounced
differences (Fischer et al., 2011). These substantial regional
variations within the United States, as well as pronounced
excess in use compared with countries to the north and south
(International Narcotics Control Board, 2011), indicates that
there are factors beyond nociception responsible for opioid
prescription patterns. Because the M-PMP
, like others, does
not include information about the patient’s diagnose(s), we
can only speculate the extent that economic, demographic,
or sociocultural factors are responsible for these differences.
Buprenorphine accounted for approximately half of all
opioid prescriptions for persons in their 20s relative to a
negligible amount for octogenarians. Although this age
difference was not unanticipated (Turner et al., 2015), the
proportion within both young adult men and women was not.
Because of the frequent reference to buprenorphine products
in the DAP and because an even cursory Internet search of
substance user groups pulls up simple, detailed, and plausi-
ble directions on how to convert the buprenorphine/naloxone
film strips into an injectable product (see also Cicero et al.,
2014b; Lavonas et al., 2014), Suboxone film strips may offer
less of a pronounced benefit over the generic Zubsolv tablets
than is generally appreciated.
The notion of one recreational agent serving as a “gate-
way” to another (Kandel & Logan, 1984) has been both
influential and controversial. Although there is a temporal
sequence that may occur for many users (e.g., cigarettes pre-
cede marijuana) who advance from more accessible to more
prohibited agents, the view that prescription opioid misuse
may lead to (i.e., causes) heroin misuse has only begun to be
evaluated (Grau et al., 2007). The quarterly analysis of drug
arrests, which identified a decrease in prescription opioids
and a corresponding increase in heroin arrests, does fit with
a gateway model. However, approximately half of heroin
addicts, if given a choice, prefer prescription opioids over
heroin (Cicero et al., 2014a), suggesting that opioid prefer-
ences are individualistic and may not uniformly escalate.
Relative to 2010, there are indications in the M-PMP of a
decrease in oxycodone (10.9%) and hydrocodone (21.8%)
prescriptions, whereas buprenorphine has undergone a pro-
nounced increase (65.0%, Supplemental Figure 5). Together,
we are cautiously optimistic that health care providers, the
general public, and policy makers have finally gained a
deeper appreciation of the risks versus benefits of Schedule
II opioids.
Some characteristics of Maine are important to con-
textualize the M-PMP and DAP findings. Maine is ranked
first for highest median age (42.2 years), first for highest
percentage of the population residing in rural areas (61.3%),
the fourth lowest state for proportion of African Americans
(1.0%), and first for fewest violent crimes (116/100K) in
the country (Jones, 2010; U.S. Census Bureau, 2010, 2012).
When Purdue Pharma (Stamford, CT) began aggressively
promoting OxyContin to primary care physicians (Van Zee,
2009), these demographics may have conferred a false sense
of immunity that resulted in Maine assuming such a promi-
nent role in opioid use and misuse. The number of pharmacy
robberies statewide decreased by 67.9% from 2012 to 2014
(J. O’Malley, personal communication, May 27, 2015).
The presence of a quantifiable level of crimes involving
medical/recreational drugs should not be used to stigmatize
the state. Over the past half-century, the first opioid used
by heroin addicts has changed from heroin to a prescription
opioid. Further, Whites and females outside of large urban
areas now account for a greater proportion of heroin addicts
(Cicero et al., 2014a), which is important considering the
limited racial diversity of Maine. A contributing factor to
our finding that arrests for Schedule II–IV drugs exceeded
those for Schedule I agents is that marijuana appears to be a
low priority among law enforcement. Because of the recently
documented HIV outbreak among individuals in southeast-
ern Indiana sharing needles to inject prescription opioids
(Calabresi, 2015; Conrad et al. 2015), it is noteworthy that
oxymorphone was relatively uncommon and pharmacies in
Maine can distribute syringes (Ginley et al., 2002). Maine
is divided into relatively few (16) counties. The finding that
areas with more opioid prescriptions also had more arrests
involving Schedule II opioids is important but should be
verified in other, more populous states.

Our findings from the M-PMP and DAP have implica-
tions for patient care. Information provided by the DAP
(which is an especially underused resource) and M-PMP
could result in initiation and modification of pain contracts
between patients and providers; increased monitoring via
“pop” pill counts, urine screens, and more frequent PMP
queries; and, in extreme cases, discontinuation of the pre-
scribing of some medications or dismissal of the patient
from practice. The age profile of opioid use in Maine may
encourage increased vigilance of young adults prescribed
buprenorphine and also older adults receiving other opioids.
Some limitations of these data sets and future direc-
tions are worthy of consideration. First, the online survey
participants were representative of pharmacists statewide
in terms of gender. The Maine Board of Pharmacy has not
consistently obtained other demographics, which precludes
further examination of the representativeness of this sample.
These findings may be less generalizable to pharmacists in
more urban states. Second, the M-PMP depends entirely on
pharmacies—and the DAP is reliant on law enforcement—to
submit accurate and complete information. Third, as noted
earlier, the M-PMP data set does not contain information
about diagnoses, which limits any inferences about the ap-
propriateness of pharmacotherapy. Other efforts to character-
ize these have determined that back pain, extremity pain, and
osteoarthritis patients account for more than half of chronic
noncancer pain patients (Boudreau et al., 2009).
Finally, the findings from the M-PMP including that
more than one fifth of the residents in each county received
an opioid prescription in 2014 are likely an underestimate
of the true level of prescription opioids and other agents.
Long-term care facilities do not relay prescription infor-
mation to the M-PMP
. Tramadol only became a scheduled
substance in the last half of 2014; therefore, Figures 1A and
2 should be interpreted in light of this caveat. International
mail order pharmacies (Russell et al., 2015) may not have
fully contributed to the M-PMP
, and the Department of Vet-
erans Affairs, which serves more than 4,000 patients, only
provided data during the last quarter of 2014. Further, the
M-PMP is legally prohibited from obtaining information
from the nine methadone clinics, which serve 4,500 patients
(Lawlor, 2015). As the track record of medical chemists to
develop abuse-proof opioids has been underwhelming thus
far (Conrad et al., 2015; Lavonas et al., 2014; Sansone &
Sansone, 2015), future updates from the M-PMP and DAP
with a focus on particular agents will be necessary.
Conclusions
Based on the three data sets, we are very conflicted about
the opioid prescription epidemic being referred to as “iatro-
genic” (Wright et al., 2014b). Prescribers and dispensers are
providing the best care they can for patients where opioids
are appropriate (Manchikanti et al., 2010). However, fre-
quent reference to specific Schedule II opioids in the DAP
,
particularly oxycodone, and that Schedule II–IV substances
were more common than Schedule I, as well as the substan-
tial volume of opioid prescriptions in the M-PMP
, indicate
that the iatrogenic label may, unfortunately, be warranted.
Pharmaceutical companies, patients, providers, and phar-
macies have contributed to opioid misuse (Calabresi, 2015;
Dyer, 2014; Manchikanti et al. 2010; Meier, 2013), and their
concerted efforts, in conjunction with law enforcement, will
be necessary to remediate the opioid misuse and diversion
problem in Maine and nationally.
