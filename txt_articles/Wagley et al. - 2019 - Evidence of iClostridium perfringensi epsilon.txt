Introduction
Clostridium perfringens is found in the gastrointestinal 
tracts of many animals. The ability of different strains 
to cause a range of diseases in human and in animals is 
ascribed largely to the differential production of tox-
ins.1 Epsilon toxin, produced by C. perfringens types B 
and D, is associated with dysentery and enterotoxaemia 
in ovines following the growth of bacteria in the intes-
tine and the production of epsilon toxin.2 The toxin 
crosses the gut wall, accumulating in the kidneys and 
brain.3 In the brain, the toxin binds to the synaptosomal 
membranes,4 myelinated structures,5,6 glial cells7 and 
oligodendrocytes8 and causes demyelination.6 Peracute 
enterotoxaemia in ovines appears without clinical signs 
and results in sudden death while acute disease leads to 
convulsions and coma.9 There are only three reports of 
the isolation of C. perfringens producing epsilon toxin 
from humans,10,11 one from the stool of a patient who 
had presented with multiple sclerosis (MS) 3 months 
previously.12
Antibodies to epsilon toxin are reported to occur in 
10% of patients with MS and in 1% of healthy indi-
viduals in the United States,12 and Cases et al.13 
recently showed that epsilon toxin affects the propa-
gation of action potentials in isolated optic nerves. As 
a result of these studies, and the similarities between 
the symptoms of ovine enterotoxaemia and humans 
suffering from MS, it has been suggested that epsilon 
toxin may contribute to the development of MS.
Here, we investigated whether antibodies to epsilon 
toxin are present in the sera of patients with clinically 
definite multiple sclerosis (CDMS) or presenting with 
clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) or optic neuritis 
(ON), the first demyelinating events suggestive of

Abstract
Background: It was recently reported that, using Western blotting, some multiple sclerosis (MS) patients 
in the United States had antibodies against epsilon toxin (Etx) from Clostridium perfringens, suggesting 
that the toxin may play a role in the disease.
Objective: We investigated for serum antibodies against Etx in UK patients with clinically definite mul-
tiple sclerosis (CDMS) or presenting with clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) or optic neuritis (ON) and 
in age- and gender-matched controls.
Methods: We tested sera from CDMS, CIS or ON patients or controls by Western blotting. We also tested 
CDMS sera for reactivity with linear overlapping peptides spanning the amino acid sequence (Pepscan) 
of Etx.
Results: Using Western blotting, 24% of sera in the combined CDMS, CIS and ON groups (n = 125) 
reacted with Etx. In the control group (n = 125), 10% of the samples reacted. Using Pepscan, 33% of sera 
tested reacted with at least one peptide, whereas in the control group only 16% of sera reacted. Out of 61 
samples, 21 (43%) were positive to one or other testing methodology. Three samples were positive by 
Western blotting and Pepscan.
Conclusion: Our results broadly support the previous findings and the role of Etx in the aetiology of MS 
warrants further investigation.

MS, alongside matched controls, using cohorts of 
individuals in the United Kingdom.
Material and methods
Patients and samples
Sera from patients with CDMS (n = 65), CIS (n = 20) 
or ON (n = 44) were obtained from UK centres. 
Patients were adults (age > 18 years) and disease 
assessment had been carried out by a MS specialist. 
McDonalds 2010 Criteria (revised) was used for the 
diagnosis of CIS and MS.14 Sera from CDMS, CIS or 
ON patients were obtained at University College 
London (UCL) and Sheffield from London-South 
East UK Research and Ethics Committee (ethics: 
2011-003475-11) and Basildon NHS trusts collected 
under the ALS biomarkers study (ethics: 09/
H0703/27) or at the Charing Cross Hospital in accord-
ance with guidelines approved by 05/MRE12/8 NRES 
Committee South Central (Berkshire). ON patient 
samples were collected as part of the trial. Age- and 
gender-matched samples from control patients were 
collected as part of the Exeter 10,000 project (ethics: 
09/H0106/75). Consent was obtained from subjects. 
Data on clinical subtypes, occurrence or absence of 
disease activity and/or progression, disease duration, 
the occurrence of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 
activity, use of disease-modifying therapy and use of 
high-dose steroids are summarised in Supplementary 
Tables S1–S3.
Toxins
Epsilon protoxin15 was activated with TPCK-treated 
trypsin 
from 
bovine 
pancreas 
(Sigma-Aldrich 
Company Ltd) for 1 hour at room temperature. Bacillus 
anthracis–protective antigen (PA83) was kindly pro-
vided by Dr ED Williamson (Dstl Porton Down).
Cell culture
Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, CHO cells 
expressing green fluorescent protein (CHO-GFP) and 
CHO cells expressing human myelin and lymphocyte 
protein (CHO-hMAL) were cultured in Dulbecco’s 
Modified Eagle’s Medium/Ham’s F12 (DMEM/F12) 
medium (Life Technologies) supplemented with 10% 
foetal bovine serum at 37°C in 95% air:5% CO2.
Construction of CHO-stable cell line expressing 
hMAL
The hMAL gene (NCBI reference NP_002362.1) was 
synthesised (GeneArt, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and 
cloned into pEF1αAcGFP-N1 (Clontech). After 
sequencing, the plasmid was transfected into CHO 
cells using Turbofect (Thermo Fisher Scientific). 
Transfectants were selected in media containing 
400 μg/mL G418 for 3 weeks. Individual clones were 
analysed under a fluorescence microscope (Olympus 
X81) to confirm membrane-associated MAL-GFP 
expression.
Neutralisation assay
Rabbit polyclonal antibody against epsilon toxin,16 
pre-immune rabbit sera, MS patient sera or control 
sera were serially diluted in an equal volume or phos-
phate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 5× CT75 of 
activated epsilon toxin. After 1 hour, the mixtures 
were added to CHO-hMAL cells to a final toxin con-
centration of 1× CT75 of epsilon toxin. Control CHO-
hMAL cells were treated with PBS, 1× CT75 of toxin 
and 0.1% Triton X-100. Following incubation for 
3 hours at 37°C, the media was replaced with 100 μL 
of serum-free DMEM/F12 and 10 μL of WST-1 rea-
gent (Abcam). Metabolic activity of cells was meas-
ured as the conversion of WST-1 into a coloured 
product. Absorbance at 420 nm was read following 
incubation for 1 hour at 37°C and normalised with 
respect to the Triton X-100-treated controls.
Competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
A competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 
(ELISA) to measure neutralising antibodies was car-
ried out using a monoscreen ELISA kit (BioX 
Diagnostics, BIO K 222/2), according to the manu-
facturers’ instructions.
Western blotting
Toxins (3–6 μg) were separated using NuPAGE 4%–
12% Bis-Tris gels and morpholineethanesulfonic acid 
(MES)-SDS running buffer (Life Technologies) and 
blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes which were 
blocked in phosphate-buffered saline–tween (PBST) 
containing 3% (w/v) dry milk powder. Toxin was 
detected after adding sera diluted 1000-fold in PBST 
with 3% (w/v) milk and incubated overnight at 4°C. 
This was followed by incubation with horseradish 
peroxide (HRP)-conjugated donkey anti-human IgG 
1:10,000 (Jackson ImmunoResearch) in PBST with 
3% (w/v) milk for 1 hour at room temperature fol-
lowed by three 15-minute washes in PBST. Signals 
were detected using Pierce ECL Western Blotting 
substrate (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and a ChemiDoc 
imaging system equipped with Quantity One 
 
software (Bio-Rad Laboratories). Samples that were

immunoreactive with epsilon toxin were Western 
blotted with a molar equivalent amount of B. anthra-
cis–protective antigen (PA83). Serum samples reac-
tive with epsilon toxin and PA83 were excluded from 
further analysis.
Epitope scanning
Overlapping peptides spanning epsilon toxin were 
synthesised and reacted with antisera by Pepscan 
(8243 RC Lelystad, The Netherlands). Antibody bind-
ing to peptides was tested using an ELISA. Peptide 
arrays were incubated with primary antibody (over-
night at 4°C). After washing, the arrays were incu-
bated with a 1/1000 dilution of an antibody peroxidase 
conjugate for 1 hour at 25°C. Colour development 
after adding 2,2′-azino-di-3-ethylbenzthiazoline sul-
phonate (ABTS) and 20 μL/mL of 3% (v/v) H2O2 
1 hour was quantified with a charge-coupled device–
camera and an image processing system. To verify the 
quality of the synthesised peptides, a separate set of 
positive and negative control peptides was synthe-
sised in parallel. These were screened with antibody 
57.9.17
Molecular modelling
Epsilon toxin (PDB ID: 1UYJ) and epitopes were 
visualised using PyMOL 42.
BLAST searches
We searched the US National Center for Biotechnology 
Information with the query epsilon toxin peptide 
‘TGVSLTTSYSFANTN’ 
using 
BLASTP 
and 
TBLASTN algorithms with default values, but with 
the E-value set to 1000.
Results
Western blotting of sera
Western blotting was used to detect antibodies in 
human sera based on the method described by Rumah 
et al.,12 but we used native epsilon toxin in place of 
recombinant his-tagged protein and diluted sera 1000-
fold, rather than 10,000-fold, before testing. Figure 1 
shows a typical blot with human sera which reacted 
strongly to epsilon toxin, weakly to epsilon toxin or did 
not react with epsilon toxin under the test conditions.
Samples that reacted with epsilon toxin were subse-
quently screened for reactivity with B. anthracis 
PA83, a pore-forming toxin which shares a hydropho-
bicity map similar to epsilon toxin.12 Seroconversion 
to PA83 is rare and would only occur in those indi-
viduals who were vaccinated against it or upon expo-
sure to B. anthracis. Rumah et al.12 suggested that a 
positive PA83 result could suggest nonspecific anti-
body responses.
Antibodies to epsilon toxin identified by Western 
blotting
We assessed the prevalence of antibodies to epsilon 
toxin in patients with demyelination, the subgroups of 
which were CDMS, CIS or ON. The latter two groups 
may develop CDMS but are early in the disease 
course. Age- and gender-matched controls were then 
examined (Table 1 and Figure 2). We repeated the 
Western blotting at least three times for each sample. 
Supplementary Table S4 shows the demographic fea-
tures of the different groups we tested in this study. In 
total, we identified 34 serum samples in the combined 
CDMS, CIS, ON groups (n = 129) that reacted with 
epsilon toxin, of which four also reacted with PA83 
and therefore were excluded from further analysis. In 
the combined control groups (n = 129) we identified 
17 serum samples that reacted with epsilon toxin, of 
Figure 1. Western blot indicating immunoreactivity to 
epsilon toxin from different sera. Lane A shows epsilon 
toxin (arrowed) reacted with a strongly positive serum 
(BUH00226), lane B shows epsilon toxin reacted with a 
weakly positive serum (BLT00139) and Lane C shows an 
example of a serum (BUH00239) which did not react with 
epsilon toxin. Molecular size markers (kDa) in Lane M.

which four also reacted with PA83 and were therefore 
excluded from further analysis outlined below.
We found that 23% of the CDMS patients’ sera had 
antibodies to epsilon toxin while the matched control 
group for this cohort showed reactivity in 8% of sam-
ples (Table 1 and Figure 2). The proportion of patients 
diagnosed with CIS/MS, relapsing-remitting multiple 
sclerosis (RRMS), secondary progressive multiple 
sclerosis (SPMS) and showing reactivity with epsilon 
toxin was broadly similar (31%, 21% and 18%, 
respectively). None of the primary progressive multi-
ple sclerosis (PPMS) samples we tested were reactive 
though the number tested (n = 5) may be too low to be 
representative of this group.
In CIS patients, we found that 35% of the sera had 
antibodies to epsilon toxin while in the matched con-
trol group 10% of sera was reactive. Follow-up patient 
data on the seven positive epsilon toxin samples from 
the CIS cohort showed that five of the seven patients 
were subsequently diagnosed with MS. We found that 
20% of the sera from ON patients were positive for 
epsilon toxin antibodies while the matched control 
group showed that 14% of the sera samples had anti-
bodies to epsilon toxin. All of the Western blotting 
positive sera from CDMS, CIS and ON patients 
reacted weakly with epsilon toxin by Western blotting 
(data not shown). One control serum sample reacted 
strongly with epsilon toxin by Western blotting (Figure 
1, lane A), but the other control sera reacted weakly.

Epitope scanning of sera
Where sufficient sera from CDMS patients (n = 43) or 
control sera (n = 32) was available, we analysed them 
for reactivity with linear overlapping peptides span-
ning the amino acid sequence of epsilon toxin 
(Pepscan). We included negative- and positive-control 
sera from rabbits before and after immunisation with 
Y43A-Y209A, an epsilon toxoid vaccine.16 We used a 
stringent signal/noise cut-off of ≥2.0 to identify posi-
tive samples. Rabbit sera before immunisation did not 
react with the peptide array. Sera from rabbits immu-
nised with the epsilon toxoid recognised several pep-
tides (Figure 3 and Supplementary Table S5).
Of 43 CDMS sera tested, 14 (33%) reacted with at 
least one peptide, whereas in the matched control 
group 5 of 32 (16%) reacted (Figure 2). Most sera rec-
ognised multiple peptides (Supplementary Table S2). 
Only three (5%) CDMS sera (309, BLT00139 and 
BLT00143) were positive by both Western blotting 
and Pepscan and one control (2%) was positive by 
both testing methods (Figure 2). Conversely, when the 
Western blotting and Pepscan results were considered 
together, 43% of CDMS samples and 16% of control 
sera were positive by at least one assay (Figure 2).
Most of the peptides recognised by CDMS sera and 
control sera were identical. However, one peptide 
(TGVSLTTSYSFANTN) was recognised by sera 
from CDMS patients that were positive by Western 
blotting but not by sera that were negative by Western 
blotting nor by control sera. When the National Center 
for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database was 
searched using this peptide, the only complete 
matches identified were towards C. perfringens 
epsilon toxin. The next closest match, with a 
Mycobacterium heraklionense hypothetical protein, 
showed 11/15 residues matched. There were no com-
plete or partial matches with human proteins.
We mapped the epitopes recognised by sera onto the 
molecular structure of epsilon toxin. The antisera raised 
against an epsilon toxoid in rabbits recognised a range 
of epitopes, mainly located in domain 1 and domain 3 
of the protein (Figure 3). Control and CDMS sera also 
recognised domains 1 and 3, as well as additional pep-
tides in domain 2. We found antibodies directed against 
the membrane insertion loop of domain 2 and espe-
cially against the TGVSLTTSYSFANTN peptide in 
CDMS patients but not in sera from controls.
Ability of sera to neutralise toxicity
We tested serum neutralisation of epsilon toxin in two 
ways. First, using a competitive ELISA kit to measure 
competition between antisera and a neutralising mon-
oclonal antibody for binding to C. perfringens epsilon 
toxin. The neutralising polyclonal serum and mono-
clonal antibody caused 90% and 75% signal inhibi-
tion, respectively (Figure 4). Rabbit sera against 
epsilon toxoid16 caused 95% inhibition of the signal, 
whereas pre-immune rabbit sera caused only 6% sig-
nal inhibition. None of the sera tested from CDMS, 
CIS or ON patients caused significant inhibition of 
the signal, even though the sera were reactive in 
Western blots or by Pepscan. None of the control sera, 
including the strongly positive BUH00226 sample, 
caused significant inhibition of the signal, even 
though these sera were reactive in Western blots or by 
Pepscan.
We also tested the ability of sera to directly neutralise 
the cytotoxicity of epsilon toxin towards CHO-hMAL 
cells. Rabbit sera against an epsilon toxoid16 neutral-
ised the toxin at 0.25 mg/mL antibody. Sera from non-
immune rabbits or the strongly positive BUH00226 
sample did not neutralise toxicity (data not shown).
Discussion
MS is a pro-inflammatory demyelinating disease of 
the central nervous system, the aetiology of which 
involves contribution from genetic and environmental 
factors. More recently, Rumah et al.12 showed that 
antibodies to epsilon toxin were more prevalent in 
MS patients than in healthy controls, suggesting a role 
for epsilon toxin in the development of MS.12 In sup-
port of this, many pathophysiological consequences 
of the exposure of animals to epsilon toxin are con-
sistent with a role of the toxin in MS. Epsilon toxin

targets synaptosomes,4 myelinic structures,5,6 glial 
cells7 and oligodendrocytes8 and causes demyelina-
tion.6 The toxin has been shown to recognise cells 
expressing myelin and lymphocyte protein (MAL18) 
including human T-cells.19 Against this background, 
we investigated whether antibodies to epsilon toxin 
are more frequently found in MS patients. We used 
Western blotting because this methodology was used 
to screen sera in the study from the United States.12
Our data suggest that seroreactivity towards epsilon 
toxin, measured using Western blotting or Pepscan, 
was more frequent in CDMS, CIS or ON patients than 
in controls. Using Western blotting, the overall inci-
dence of immunoreactivity in CDMS patients in the 
United Kingdom (24%) was higher than the incidence 
reported in the United States (10%). Seroreactivity to 
epsilon toxin also occurred in the control group, also 
at a higher incidence (10%) than previously reported 
(1%). These findings are consistent with the increased 
sensitivity of the assay we have used.12 MS patients 
often show elevated levels of antibodies in sera, 
though it is not clear what these antibodies are directed 
against.20 Our finding that antibody reactivity 
occurred with some control sera, albeit at a lower fre-
quency, indicates that the responses we detected in 
CDMS patients were not simply due to the elevated 
level of antibodies as a consequence of MS disease.20
Reactivity in the control group also suggests that 
exposure to epsilon toxin does not necessarily result 
in the development of MS. In an attempt to under-
stand whether exposure to epsilon toxin is associated 
with the subsequent development of disease, we 
looked at patients with CIS. Around 30%–70% indi-
viduals with CIS develop MS.21,22 We found that 71% 
(5 out of 7) CIS individuals with antibody to epsilon 
toxin went on to develop CDMS, but this finding 
would need to be confirmed by screening a larger 
group.
The intensity of the responses we saw in CDMS 
patients and in controls were broadly similar by 
Western blotting. However, with the exception of 
control BUH0226, the responses that we saw were 
weak. Different serotypes of epsilon toxin have not 
been described, but we cannot discount the possibility 
of this. Another possible explanation for the weak 
responses is that antibodies are directed against a dif-
ferent structural form of epsilon toxin. During inser-
tion into host-cell membranes, the protein would 
undergo structural changes, thereby altering epitopes.2 
Antibodies directed against a different structural form 
might be unable to neutralise the toxin. Small differ-
ences in the epitope recognised by antibodies can pro-
foundly influence their abilities to neutralise other 
toxins.23

There was little overlap between results obtained 
using Western blotting and peptide scanning. This is 
surprising since both methods should primarily detect 
linear epitopes. However, Western blots can be sensi-
tive to the denaturation state of the electrophoresed 
antigen.24 In addition, since the Western blotting and 
Pepscan studies were carried out in different laborato-
ries, it is possible that differences in sample handling 
affected the results. During this study, we also carried 
out some preliminary work to peptide map sera from 
eight patients with CIS/ON. In this pilot study, we 
found that five sera showed reactivity with peptides. 
Further studies should investigate a larger cohort of 
CIS/ON sera.
Several previous studies have found that dysbiosis of 
C. perfringens in the gut is not associated with MS,25–
29 though one study did find that C. perfringens levels 
were elevated in patients diagnosed with neuromyeli-
tis optica.25 However, these studies characterised the 
population at the species level. It is known that C. 
perfringens strains, which normally colonise the 
human gut, are not able to produce epsilon toxin. One 
hypothesis is that replacement with strains producing 
the toxin triggers MS,12 and this would not be appar-
ent from changes in the gut microbiome. During this 
project, we searched human gut metagenome data sets 
at the NCBI human microbiome project (70 healthy 
volunteers) for the presence of the epsilon toxin gene. 
We identified the gene encoding alpha toxin, which is 
common to all C. perfringens strains, but we did not 
identify matches with the epsilon toxin gene.
A key question is whether immunoreactivity towards 
epsilon toxin is indicative of toxin exposure and 
whether the toxin plays a role in the development of 
MS. Some elements of our study support this sugges-
tion, especially when viewed in combination with the 
previous findings.12 Of CDMS samples, tested by 
Western Blotting or Pepscan, 26 (43%) were positive 
under one or the other methods, whereas only 10 
(16%) of the control sera were positive. This indicates 
that MS patients are more than twice as likely to pos-
sess antibodies to epsilon toxin. However, our finding 
that responses were generally weak, rather than show-
ing a spectrum of responses, is unusual. The evidence 
for a role of epsilon toxin in the aetiology of MS war-
rants further investigation.
