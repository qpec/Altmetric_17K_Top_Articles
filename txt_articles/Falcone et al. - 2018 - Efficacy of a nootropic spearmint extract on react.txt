Abstract
Background: Proprietary spearmint extract (PSE) containing a minimum 14.5% rosmarinic acid and 24% total
phenolic content, has evinced positive effects on cognition in individuals aged 50–70 with memory impairment
after chronic supplementation. To address the growing interest in connecting mental and physical performance,
the present study examined whether the nootropic effects of PSE translate into changes in reactive agility following
daily supplementation with PSE.
Methods: Utilizing a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel design, healthy, recreationally-active
men and women (n = 142) received 900 mg of PSE or placebo (PLA) daily for 90 days. Reactive agility, our primary
outcome, was determined by measuring the number of hits and average reaction time (ART) on a Makoto Arena
II, a 3600 audio-visual device that measures stationary, lateral, and multi-directional active choice reaction
performance. Safety was evaluated using complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, and blood
lipids. Measurements were evaluated on days 7, 30, and 90 of supplementation.
Results: An overall treatment effect (p = 0.019) was evident for increased hits with PSE on the stationary test with
footplates, with between group differences at Day 30 (PSE vs. PLA: 28.96 ± 2.08 vs. 28.09 ± 1.92 hits; p = 0.040) and
Day 90 (PSE vs. PLA: 28.42 ± 2.54 vs. 27.02 ± 3.55 hits; p = 0.002). On the same task, ART improved (treatment
effect, p = 0.036) with PSE at Day 7 (PSE vs. PLA: 0.5896 ± 0.060 vs. 0.6141 ± 0.073 s; p = 0.049) and Day 30 (PSE vs.
PLA: 0.5811 ± 0.068 vs. 0.6033 ± 0.055 s; p = 0.049). PSE also significantly increased hits (treatment effect, p = 0.020)
at Day 30 (PSE vs. PLA: 19.25 ± 1.84 vs. 18.45 ± 1.48 hits; p = 0.007) and Day 90 (PSE vs. PLA: 19.39 ± 1.90 vs. 18.66 ± 1.64
hits; p = 0.026) for the multi-directional test with footplates. Significant differences were not observed in the remaining
Makoto tests. PSE was well tolerated as evidenced by no effects observed in the blood safety panels.
Conclusions: The findings of the current study demonstrate that consumption of 900 mg of PSE improved specific
measures of reactive agility in a young, active population.

 Background
Recent evidence indicates that many individuals are in-
creasingly willing to utilize supplements that enhance
cognition, known as nootropics, to improve or maintain
brain health [1]. While the primary use of nootropics
may be for everyday improvements in attention and
focus, athletes and active individuals are supplementing
with nootropics in an effort to enhance their perform-
ance [2–5]. Preliminary evidence indicates that increased
focus can improve physical performance [6–9] but there
is very little evidence to date indicating that enhanced
cognition through supplementation results in improved
athletic performance.
Many botanicals have demonstrated nootropic benefits
following oral administration, such as gingko biloba [10],
ginseng [11], and various members of the mint (Lamia-
ceae) family [12–15]. Traditionally, members of the mint
family have been utilized for nervous system disorders,
as well as respiratory and gastrointestinal issues [16–18],
due to active ingredients such as menthone, piperitone
oxide, camphor, linalool, and rosmarinic acid [19, 20].
Rosmarinic acid is a caffeic acid ester found in rosemary
and spearmint that has demonstrated antimicrobial [21],
antiviral [22], antioxidant [21, 23], anti-inflammatory
[24], and neuroprotective [25–31] activity in vitro and in
vivo. More recently, botanicals in the mint family, such
as sage [12–14], rosemary [15], and lemon balm [32],
have been shown to benefit memory (speed of memory
and secondary) and attention. The proprietary spearmint
extract (PSE) utilized in the present study was developed
through traditional breeding techniques to contain more
than 60 phenolic compounds in addition to higher
amounts of naturally-occurring rosmarinic acid (a mini-
mum of 14.5%) than other commercially available spear-
mint extracts [33]. An open-label human trial showed
that 900 mg of PSE for 30 days significantly improved
reasoning and attention in individuals aged 50–70 with
self-reported, age-related memory issues [34]. A ran-
domized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was
conducted in individuals with age-associated memory
impairment using PSE supplemented for 90 days [35]
and demonstrated significant improvement in both qual-
ity of working memory and spatial working memory. Fi-
nally, small-scale studies in younger populations, aged
18–50, were conducted which showed that acute con-
sumption of PSE numerically improved subjective as-
sessment
of
cognitive
improvements
and
objective
measures of attention [36]. Though studies have investi-
gated Lamiaceae and cognition, less research has been
conducted on spearmint consumption and exercise
performance.
Essential oils of Lamiaceae, specifically spearmint and
peppermint, have been shown to have positive effects on
lung function; therefore, studies have investigated their
effects on exercise performance. An open-label study
demonstrated that inhalation of Mentha spicata im-
proved lung function and running times of healthy indi-
viduals [37]. Similarly, Meamarbashi and colleagues [38]
observed that healthy university students improved their
ventilatory outcomes, running time to exhaustion, work,
and power after 10 days of consumption of 50 μl of
peppermint. In a follow-up study by the same laboratory
utilizing the same population [39], a single dose of 50 μl
of peppermint increased grip force, vertical jump, and
long jump. Additionally, the researchers tested simple
reaction time via a passive computerized test battery,
and both audio simple reaction time and visual reaction
time improved [39]. Though the effects of Lamiaceae on
exercise performance and reaction time have been tested
within a single study, one cannot draw conclusions link-
ing physical and mental performance since these ob-
served benefits may have been caused by separate
mechanisms, such as improved lung function and in-
creased focus, respectively. Preliminary data from our la-
boratory indicated that an intervention can differentially
affect results from active and passive choice reaction
performance testing [40], suggesting that passive choice
reaction testing may not necessarily translate to per-
formance in athletic endeavors. Active choice reaction
performance can translate to athletic performance by en-
hancing an athlete’s reactive agility, which can be defined
as any unplanned change in direction or speed. Reactive
agility is an aspect of physical performance; interestingly,
however, data suggest that reactive agility may rely more
on cognitive than physical parameters [41]. In fact, react-
ive agility correlated more highly with response time and
decision-making time – which are aspects of cognition –
than sprint speed, change-of-direction speed, or other
physical measurements [41]. In order to link mental and
physical performance, novel testing devices that combine
physical and cognitive activities, like the Makoto device,
may be useful. Therefore, the purpose of the present
study was to investigate the effects of daily supplementa-
tion of 900 mg of PSE, a water extracted proprietary
spearmint extract with a robust phenolic profile, on re-
active agility. The primary outcome of the study was re-
active agility, as measured by the Makoto Arena II
device.
Secondary
outcomes
included
inflammation,
stress, and safety as measured by analyses of blood bio-
markers. The research hypothesis was that daily supple-
mentation with 900 mg of PSE will significantly improve
reactive agility compared to placebo.
Methods
Experimental design
A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel
design was implemented to determine the effects of PSE
on reactive agility in healthy individuals aged 18–50

 years. A total of 485 individuals were initially contacted
via phone to screen for eligibility (Fig. 1). Individuals
who met inclusion/exclusion criteria were asked to re-
port to the laboratory (MusclePharm Sports Science In-
stitute, Denver, CO) for a familiarization visit so that the
reactive agility tests could be practiced to minimize any
learning effects (Fig. 2). One hundred forty-two partici-
pants were randomized into PSE or placebo (PLA)
groups in a staggered start design (1 week after screen-
ing visit). To generate a randomization schedule using
block randomization, participants were stratified by sex
and age into four groups: young (18–35 years)/male, older
(36–50 years)/male, young/female, and older/female. A
random sequence of blinded treatments (A and B) was
generated by the principal investigator using 37 blocks of 4
on a research randomizer website (www.randomizer.org).
These blocks were applied to each stratum mentioned
above as each previous block of 4 was filled by participants.
All blood was collected at a LabCorp facility and all other
measures were performed at the MusclePharm Sports
Science Institute.
At baseline (Day 0) participants were instructed to
take two capsules of either PLA or PSE (providing 900
mg PSE/day containing a minimum of 14.5% rosmarinic
acid and 24% total polyphenols (expressed as gallic acid
equivalents); Neumentix™ Phenolic Complex K110–42,
Kemin Foods, L.C., Des Moines, IA) each morning with
breakfast for 90 days, except on test days, when they
took the capsules directly after testing. Both types of
capsules were produced by the same manufacturer to be
identical in shape, size, and color, and were sealed in
identical bottles. All investigators involved in product
dispensing, data collection, and analysis of outcomes
were blinded in the following manner: PSE and PLA
bottles were labeled “A” or “B” by unblinded individuals at
Kemin Foods LC. who were not involved in subject inter-
action or data assessment. All bottles were labeled accord-
ing to ICH-GCP guidelines. At each post-supplementation
study visit (Days 7, 30, and 90) capsules were counted for
compliance. Daily compliance was also logged by the par-
ticipants in a study diary as a secondary measure. After
fasting for 10 h, participants arrived at the laboratory at
baseline, and after 7, 30, and 90 days of consuming the
supplement daily. Testing consisted of an interactive
audio-visual reaction time test battery, a blood draw, and
vital signs assessment. After testing, a meal replacement
bar was provided to participants (Combat Crunch™;
MusclePharm Inc., Denver, CO). An Institutional Review
Board (Quorum Review IRB, Seattle, WA) approved the
study protocol and informed consent documents prior to
initiation of the study. Furthermore, all study procedures
were consistent with Good Clinical Practices under the
United States Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations
and the Declaration of Helsinki.
Participants
Healthy, recreationally-active men and women between
the ages of 18–50 years were recruited for the present
study. Healthy was defined as having a body mass index be-
tween 18.5–29.99 kg/m2 or between 30.0–34.99 kg/m2 with
a body fat of < 39% for women aged 18–39 years, < 40% for
women aged 40–50 years, < 25% for men aged 18–39 years,
or < 28% for men aged 40–50 years [42]. Body fat was
determined using bioelectric impedance analysis (InBody
Co., Seoul, South Korea). Health status was assessed using
a health history questionnaire. A recreationally-active indi-
vidual was defined as ≥1 and ≤ 6 h of moderate and/or vig-
orous exercise per week as measured by the New Zealand
Fig. 1 CONSORT diagram for Study Participants. A total of 485 participants were screened. Healthy active young men and women were randomly
assigned to one of two treatments, 0 PLA or 900 mg/day PSE (Total randomized N = 142; N = 69 (PLA), N = 73 (PSE)). A total of 54 and 52 subjects
completed the trial in the PLA and 900 mg/day PSE groups, respectively. Abbreviations: PSE, proprietary spearmint extract; PLA, placebo; AE, adverse event

 Physical Activity Questionnaire [43]. Eligibility also in-
cluded willingness to abstain from caffeine-containing
products for 10 h prior to and during all test visits, from al-
cohol consumption and physical activity for the previous
24 h, and from strenuous resistance exercise (defined as
heavier than a 6-repetition maximum [the most weight
which a participant could successfully lift 6 times]) for 48 h.
Participants were required to keep their sleep consistent
(within 2 h) each night prior to all study visits. Finally, par-
ticipants were required to maintain their normal diet (in-
cluding repetition of dietary intake for the 24 h prior to
each study visit), exercise, and sleep regimens throughout
the study. All females were amenorrhoeic during test visits.
A high school diploma or the equivalent was also necessary
for inclusion.
Participants were excluded from the study if they had
a history or presence of a clinically important cardiac,
renal, hepatic, endocrine (including diabetes mellitus),
pulmonary, biliary, gastrointestinal, pancreatic, uncon-
trolled hypertension, depression or neurologic disorder.
Presence of cancer in the past 2 years was a criterion for
exclusion. Additional criteria for exclusion included: col-
orblindness, pregnancy, history of alcohol abuse (12
months), history of repeated minor head injury or a
period of unconsciousness of 1 h or more, high con-
sumption of caffeine (≥500 mg/d), marijuana use (in
prior 2 months), tobacco use (in prior 6 months), an ac-
tive infection, use of psychotropic medications (in prior
4 weeks), use of supplements known to improve cogni-
tive function, an allergy to ingredients of the test prod-
uct or the snack provided, or a sleep disorder or
occupation where sleep during the overnight hours was
irregular.
Reaction performance assessments
The interactive audio-visual reaction time test battery
was performed on the Makoto Arena II device (Makoto
USA Inc., Elk Grove Village, IL), a device which has
been employed in studies previously [40, 44–47]. The
Makoto device is a 3600 audio-visual device consisting
of 3 towers 1.83 m tall in the shape of a triangle with
2.44 m between towers. Each tower consists of 16 tar-
gets: 12 on each tower (levels a, b, and c; see Fig. 3) and
4 on each footplate on the floor (level d; see Fig. 3)
intended to be struck with hands and feet, respectively.
A line of black tape was placed on the ground whose
center is 1.55 m from each of the first two towers. Par-
ticipants started behind the line and faced forward for
all tests. Ten tests were utilized to address a variety of
perception and movement modalities. The first three
tests involved a single-step protocol, where a single tar-
get on one of two towers (tower 1 or 2, level b, top of
the diamond of four panels; see Fig. 3) would light up
once and the participant would move toward the target
and strike it. The three single-step tests utilized either
an audio stimulus, a visual stimulus, or a combined
audio and visual stimulus. To eliminate guessing order
by the participant, the single-step tests were each per-
formed five times in a random order with two tests to
the left (tower 3), two tests to the right (tower 1), and
one random direction (left or right) with its score dis-
carded. Duplicate scores for each side (left or right) were

 averaged for reporting purposes, such that each of the
three single-step tests resulted in a score for left and a
score for right. The remaining seven tests were all timed
tests with the panels exhibiting both audio and visual
stimuli in unison until the allotted time was completed.
The fourth and fifth tests were 30 s stationary tests with-
out or with footplates (level d), in which the participant
was in front of one tower (tower 1) and the 12 tower tar-
gets (or 16 targets with footplates) were struck as
quickly as possible. The sixth and seventh tests were lat-
eral movement tests utilizing two towers (towers 1 and
2), which involved the participant moving back and forth
between the two towers as the 12 hand targets from
each of the towers (or 16 targets with footplates) acti-
vated one at a time for 30 s. The eighth and ninth tests
were 30-s multi-directional movement tests using all
three
towers, and
involved
the
participant moving
among the three towers as the 12 hand targets from
each of the towers (or 16 targets with footplates). The
tenth test was identical to the ninth, except that it lasted
2 min. All the 30-s tests (tests 4–9) were performed in
duplicate and scores were averaged. Reaction performance
was captured as the number of hits and average reaction
time (ART) for all tests, except the single step testing for
which only one hit occurred each test and therefore only
reaction time was captured. Targets were activated for a
maximum of 10 s, so activated targets could not be missed
since participants had ample time to strike them. Since
the single step tests were short in duration and not fa-
tiguing, the rest periods were as short as possible: 5 s. Be-
tween every iteration of each 30-s test, participants rested
for 30 s. Prior to the 2-min test, participants were given
60 s of rest.
Inflammatory biomarkers and safety assessments
After a 10 h overnight fast, blood samples were collected
via venipuncture by a trained phlebotomist. After collec-
tion, samples were analyzed (Laboratory Corporation of
America, Burlington, NC) for the following parameters:
complete blood count (CBC) [white blood cell count
(WBC),
red
blood
cell
count
(RBC),
hemoglobin,
hematocrit, mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean
corpuscular
hemoglobin
(MCH),
mean
corpuscular
hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), red blood cell dis-
tribution width (RDW), platelets (absolute), neutrophils
(percent and absolute), lymphocytes (percent and abso-
lute), monocytes (percent and absolute), eosinophils
(percent and absolute), basophils (percent and abso-
lute)], comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP) [serum
glucose, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, esti-
mated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), BUN:creatinine,
sodium, potassium, chloride, carbon dioxide, calcium,
protein, albumin, globulin, albumin:globulin (A/G), bili-
rubin, alkaline phosphatase, aspartate aminotransferase
(AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT)], lipids [total
cholesterol, triglycerides, high density lipoprotein (HDL)
cholesterol, very low density lipoprotein (VLDL), low
density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, LDL:HDL ratio],
and biomarkers of stress and inflammation [cortisol,
C-reactive protein, and interleukin 6 (IL6)]. Upon arrival
to the laboratory and after resting seated for at least 5
min, vital signs (systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart
rate) were measured in duplicate via an automated digital
sphygmomanometer (Omron M6 AC, Omron Inc., Kyoto,
Japan) and averaged. Duplicate tests were conducted with
a minimum of 2 min between tests. Blood pressure mea-
surements were considered accurate if no more than 5
mmHg variation occurred between measurements. In
addition to the above, participants were queried on ad-
verse events (AE) throughout the trial.
Exercise, sleep, and food logs
To control for changes in exercise, sleep, and diet, par-
ticipants were asked to keep exercise, sleep, and diet
constant throughout the study period. To monitor ad-
herence, exercise, sleep, and food logs were submitted
throughout the study. Participants were required to
write down the hours and type of exercise performed
daily such as strength, cardio, or a combined strength/
cardio exercise (CrossFit, yoga, etc.). The exercise logs
were checked each visit to ensure that participants did
not exercise 24 h prior or exercise strenuously 48 h prior
to study visits. The logs were also evaluated to confirm
participants did not exercise more than 6 h/week or less
than 1 h/week, the limits set by the inclusion criteria to
which participants agreed to keep constant throughout
the trial. Hours of sleep per night were also recorded.
Average weekly hours of exercise and sleep were evalu-
ated at each study visit. A pre-visit food log was cap-
tured
during
the
24 h
prior
to
baseline
(Day
0),
photocopied and returned to the participants so that
they could repeat this diet the day prior to each visit. A
3-day food log was recorded for three non-consecutive
days (two weekdays and one weekend day) between each
visit, so any changes in diet could be calculated.
Statistical analyses
An evaluable sample size of 53 subjects per group was
expected to provide 80% power (two-sided, α = 0.05) to
detect an 8% difference in the number of hits in an as-
sessment of reactive agility utilizing the Makoto device
[44, 45]. A sample of at least 69 subjects per group was
randomized to account for attrition and non-compliance
(Fig. 1).
Statistical analyses were conducted using SAS version
9.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) by an independent,
third-party statistician (Summit Analytical, Denver, CO).
Analyses were completed on an intent-to-treat (ITT)

 population which included all participants who were
randomized into the study and consumed at least one
dose of study product. A mixed model of repeated mea-
sures (MMRM) analysis was fit to the data for each
continuous and assumed continuous study variable. All
MMRM models contained the main effect of treatment
(active vs. control), the main effect of time, and the
interaction between treatment and time. P values using
a model fit to raw data values containing treatment (ac-
tive vs. control), time (Days 0, 7, 30, and 90), and the
treatment x time interaction were evaluated. To ac-
count for observed differences at baseline for the in-
flammatory marker, CRP, a mixed-effects analysis of
covariance (ANCOVA) model was utilized a priori. The
ANCOVA model contained treatment (active vs. con-
trol), time (Days 7, 30, and 90), and the treatment x
time interaction where participants’ baseline data for a
given outcome (Day 0) was included as the covariate. A
Fisher’s exact test was applied to demographics and at-
trition. Total AE and AE related to the study product
were evaluated by Chi square analysis. Effect sizes are
presented as Cohen’s d and interpreted as 0.2 = small,
0.5 = medium, 0.8 = large. Significance levels for each
test, main effect and interaction were evaluated at
alpha = 0.05. Data are represented as means ± standard
deviation (SD).
Results
Demographics
One hundred and forty-two individuals were random-
ized, 69 into the PLA and 73 into the PSE groups.
Fifty-four and fifty-two participants completed the trial
in the PLA and PSE treatment groups, respectively.
Demographics are shown in Table 1. Treatment groups
were well-balanced in demographics for the baseline
characteristics. Although exercise as self-reported on the
New Zealand Physical Activity score was different at the
screening visit (p = 0.01), comparison of the actual hours
of exercise collected on study diaries between screening
and baseline visits (Day 0) indicated no differences be-
tween groups in exercise.
Compliance
Compliance was not significantly different at any time-
point. At Day 90, compliance was 95.4 and 96.8% in the
PLA and PSE groups, respectively, with no difference be-
tween groups (p = 0.328). Attrition among all partici-
pants was 25.4%, and it was not significantly different
between treatments or genders (p = 0.5048).
Reaction performance assessments
Data and statistical analyses for outcomes obtained utiliz-
ing the Makoto device are shown in Table 2. The hits
obtained with the stationary test with footplates for 30 s
(Fig. 4) were significantly higher in PSE compared with
PLA at Day 30 (PSE vs. PLA: 28.96 ± 2.08 vs. 28.09 ± 1.92
hits; p = 0.040; d = 0.435) and Day 90 (PSE vs. PLA:
28.42 ± 2.54 vs. 27.02 ± 3.55 hits; p = 0.002; d = 0.454).
ART for the stationary test with footplates measured
for 30 s were significantly lower in PSE compared
with PLA at Day 7 (PSE vs. PLA: 0.5896 ± 0.060 vs. 0.6141
± 0.073 s; p = 0.049; d = − 0.367) and Day 30 (PSE vs. PLA:
0.5811 ± 0.068 vs. 0.6033 ± 0.055 s; p = 0.049; d = − 0.359).
The hits obtained with the multi-directional test with foot-
plates (Fig. 5) for 30 s were significantly higher in PSE com-
pared with PLA at Day 30 (PSE vs. PLA: 19.25 ± 1.84 vs.
18.45 ± 1.48 hits; p = 0.007; d = 0.479) and Day 90 (PSE vs.
PLA: 19.39 ± 1.90 vs. 18.66 ± 1.64 hits; p = 0.026; d = 0.411).
Significant
differences
were
not
observed
in
the
remaining Makoto tests.
Biomarkers of stress and inflammation
Plasma cortisol, IL6 and CRP were measured at all
timepoints and are shown in Fig. 6. Comparisons be-
tween PSE and PLA were not significantly different for
cortisol and IL6. Differences at baseline (p = 0.03) were
present for CRP; therefore, ANCOVA was utilized to
identify a significant treatment x visit interaction (p =
0.049) and pairwise comparisons revealed that PSE
significantly decreased CRP at Day 30 compared to
PLA (p = 0.045).

 Safety assessment
Adverse
events
were
collected
for
all
participants
throughout the study. There was no difference in the
total number of AE between groups (p = 0.5935). In
addition, the total number of AE related to study prod-
uct did not differ between groups (p = 0.3020). Complete
blood count, complete metabolic profile, lipids, body
metrics, and vital signs were assessed to evaluate overall
health status over the study period. No overall treatment
effects were observed for any of the outcomes (Add-
itional file 1: Tables S1-S4). Four outcomes: absolute
monocytes, absolute granulocytes, granulocyte percent-
ages, and systolic blood pressure did evince significant
treatment x visit interactions; however, any differences
evident at day 30 were not significant at day 90 and all
values remained within normal limits and were not
deemed clinically relevant.
Diet, exercise, and sleep measurements
Evaluation of diet records collected at each study period
indicated no difference between groups in total calorie,
protein, fat, or carbohydrate intake (Table 3). Partici-
pants appeared to have maintained consistent diet over
the 90-day study period and self-reported sleep and ex-
ercise also appeared to have been kept constant and did
not differ between groups (Table 4).

 Discussion
The results of the present study suggest that consumption
of PSE can improve reactive agility. We formally accept our
hypothesis that daily supplementation of 900 mg of PSE
can significantly improve selected markers of reactive agil-
ity, specifically stationary and multi-directional when both
hand and foot strikes are involved. The multi-directional
test with footplates evinced improvements in hits after
long-term supplementation (Day 30 and Day 90), and the
reaction time trended toward improvement. The number
of hits on the stationary test with footplates was signifi-
cantly higher after long-term supplementation (Day 30 and
Day 90), and the reaction time improved at Day 7 and Day
30, with a trend observed at Day 90.
To our knowledge, there are no existing studies on re-
active agility after supplementation with botanical ingre-
dients. The Makoto testing utilized in the present study
may address the cognitive aspects of reactive agility,
such as choice reaction time, more than the physical
aspects, when compared to more common reactive
agility testing [41, 48]. A typical reactive agility test con-
sists of unidirectional running with one unplanned
change-of-direction [41], which relies more on physical
aspects of agility than the Makoto testing, which utilizes
multiple stimuli to invoke constant changes of direction,
speed, and decision making and may favor the cognitive
aspects, such as response time. Therefore, it may be use-
ful to compare the present findings to cognitive studies
that utilized choice reaction time testing. Results from
the present study are supported by existing literature on
choice reaction time in botanical extracts from the mint
family containing rosmarinic acid. Acute administration
of 333 mg of an ethanolic extract of sage was found to
improve choice reaction time at 4 and 6 h [14]. In
addition, acute administration of doses of 300–900 mg
of a methanolic lemon balm improved choice reaction
time at 2.5, 4 and 6 h post-supplementation [49]. A sec-
ond sage study demonstrated no significant changes in
choice reaction time; however, the extract was an essen-
tial oil high in monoterpenoids and low in rosmarinic
acid, which could account for the difference in findings
[50]. While the previous studies used acute supplemen-
tation of either solvent extracted extracts of the mint
family or an essential oil, the present study involved
chronic administration of a natural water-extracted PSE.
In addition, the choice reaction time testing utilized in
the previous studies was very simple (involved pressing
“YES” or “NO” buttons when these words were pre-
sented on the screen) and passive, while the present
study measured active choice reaction performance with
tests that varied in complexity, such as the addition of
footplates.

 Though few studies have compared active and passive
choice reaction performance testing, data from our labora-
tory suggest that results may vary between the two types
of tests. In one study, healthy, active participants were
dehydrated and choice reaction performance was com-
pared pre and post-dehydration utilizing both active test-
ing via Makoto and passive choice reaction performance
via Stroop test and shifting attention test [40]. Surpris-
ingly, dehydration improved choice reaction time as
assessed in the shifting attention test and decreased errors
during the Stroop test; however, active choice reaction per-
formance significantly decreased via 30 s multi-directional
test without footplates as measured with Makoto. The
findings demonstrate that active and passive choice reac-
tion testing may yield significantly different results, sug-
gesting that active testing may be more relevant in athletic
populations where improved exercise performance may be
the goal. Therefore, the use of a novel testing device, such
as the Makoto Arena II, which can measure choice reac-
tion time while the participant is active, is important to
elucidate the connection between cognitive and physical
activity.
In the current study, the tests in which significant differ-
ences were evident, the stationary and multi-directional
tests, also involved footplates. The inclusion of footplates
presented an additional shifting attention component, as
the participant was required to switch between responding
with hands or feet. While classic cognitive attention tests
do not require the participants to make similar attention
shifts, one study on sage and two studies on PSE evaluated
attention and generally support the findings of the present
study. An acute dose of 333 mg of sage was shown to in-
duce improvements in both accuracy and speed of atten-
tion [14]. An open-label study on older individuals with
self-reported memory impairment supplemented with
900 mg of PSE improved attention at 2 and 4 h after acute
supplementation and after 30 days of chronic supplemen-
tation [34]. Additionally, a small-scale study in younger
participants numerically improved attention after acute
administration with 900 mg of PSE [36]. Furthermore, the
addition of footplates may not target attention (sensory in-
put) as much as it highlights a complex psychomotor task
(output). Unfortunately, no previous studies could be
found that investigated shifting hand and foot responses.
Of the studies that have previously utilized the Makoto de-
vice, two did not involve footplates [44, 45]. Studies from
our laboratory have utilized the Makoto Arena II with foot-
plates; however, neither study directly compared tests with
and without footplates [40, 46]. One study utilized tests
with and without footplates [40], but the tests varied to
such a degree that direct comparisons could not be made.
Another study demonstrated sex differences in reaction
time after dehydration, but only the multi-directional,
2-min test with footplates was utilized [46]. Since the tests
on the Makoto are physical performance tasks, there
are important differences in the demands on the
lower body when footplates are added from a motor
and psychomotor perspective. To our knowledge, the
present study is the first to demonstrate improve-
ments when the subjects were required to shift atten-
tion between hand and foot strikes.

 The ability to rapidly shift attention between hand and
foot strikes could have practical relevance to sport-specific
athletic performance. One relevant application would be
in combat sports that allow hand and foot strikes, such as
mixed martial arts or kickboxing. Some of the other sports
where shifting attention between hands and feet might
affect performance include any sport that requires feet to
be rapidly adjusted to a set stance and then hands are pri-
marily utilized. Some examples include: baseball (running
for a ball, then catching and throwing), basketball (run-
ning to a shooting spot without the ball, then catching,
passing, and shooting), volleyball or tennis (running to a
spot, then setting feet and hitting the ball). Though ath-
letic performance and exercise performance were not
tested directly, active choice reaction performance testing
will better translate to athletic performance than standard,
passive testing (i.e. cognitive tests that do not involve
complex physical responses), and future studies should in-
vestigate whether the hypothesis that the beneficial effects
that were observed in the present study will translate to
factual improvements in athletic performance in response
to PSE supplementation.
Several of the results on certain reactive agility tests
did not achieve significance, most likely due to variations
in the specific domains targeted by the individual tests.
The three types of tests where results were not signifi-
cant were the lateral test, the single-step tests, and the
multi-directional test for 2 min. The lateral test is a
sports-specific movement which is highly practiced
among specific elite athletes. An example would be
when facing an opponent, such as football, soccer, or
wrestling. The general population does not practice lat-
eral movements and most likely would not be very profi-
cient, potentially leading to wider variability and less
sensitivity in the measurements. In contrast, the station-
ary test (in which we identified differences following PSE
supplementation in the current study) does not require
movement among towers; therefore, it does not require
proficiency in any sport-related movement and could be
better suited for a recreationally active population as used
in the current study. The multi-directional test (another
test where differences were identified in the current
study), while involving lower body movement, does not
require movement that is as specific as the lateral test.
The spinning and pivoting movements that are needed to
respond to the 3 towers in the multi-directional test are
movements that are required in everyday life to respond
to stimuli in 3600 of space, whereas the lateral movement
in the lateral test occurs less frequently in quotidian life.
Therefore, the multi-directional test may be better suited
than the lateral test for the recreationally active population
used in the current study. The single-step tests, while not
requiring any sports-specific proficiency, do involve a skill
that may also be better suited to a population of elite
athletes. The single step tests measure the initial burst of
acceleration or “first step” after a stimulus is presented;
however, acceleration may not be as crucial for recre-
ational athletes and, therefore, not be sensitive enough to
detect changes following PSE consumption in this popula-
tion. The multi-directional test when administered for 2
min is designed to incorporate the influence of fatigue.
The results for the multi-directional test with footplates for
30 s were significantly improved following PSE supplemen-
tation, thus demonstrating choice reaction time perform-
ance in a 3600 audio and visual field with a shifting
attention component was improved. However, when con-
ducting the identical test elongated for a total of 2 min, fa-
tigue becomes a dominant factor as reaction times become
slower. Therefore, the lack of significance in this longer test
suggests that the current study may not have been pow-
ered to evaluate the confounding factor of fatigue on per-
formance. Finally, since the results of the tests without
footplates were not significant, this suggests that PSE con-
sumption significantly enhances performance only in more
multi-dimensional, more complex tests of reactive agility.
Blood biomarkers of inflammation and stress were
evaluated with all outcomes showing improvement over
baseline; however, only CRP scores were significant. The
decrease in the inflammatory biomarker CRP is congru-
ent with traditional usage of mint as an herbal medicine
[17] and the literature in which spearmint decreased in-
flammatory signaling. Though studies in humans are
scarce, multiple in vitro and in vivo studies have demon-
strated the anti-inflammatory benefits of spearmint con-
sumption [51–53]. A variety of spearmint bred for high
rosmarinic acid was incubated in gastric and intestinal
fluids to simulate digestion and absorption, then subse-
quently exposed to cartilage cultured with lipopolysac-
charide (LPS) [51]. The spearmint significantly inhibited
LPS-induced prostaglandin E2 and nitric oxide expres-
sion. In rats, four solvent fractions of Mentha spicata
were evaluated after acute and 7-day chronic oral ad-
ministration [53]. The ethyl acetate extract (160 mg/kg
body weight in 25% DMSO) reduced inflammation after
both acute and chronic administration at levels compar-
able to anti-inflammatory drugs, which served as a posi-
tive control. Pearson et al. demonstrated that horses fed
28.1 g/d of high-rosmarinic acid mint for 24 days and
then injected with LPS on day 21 exhibited reduced
markers of inflammation and immune response in their
synovial fluid, including prostaglandin E2, glycosamino-
glycans, white blood cells, segmented neutrophils, and
lymphocytes [52].
Although the PSE in the current study is water-extracted,
the polyphenolic components may provide anti-inflammatory
benefits that could contribute to the observed improvements
in reactive agility. Inflammation plays a major role in brain
function [54], and CRP has been shown to be directly

Page 11 of 14
 neurotoxic [55]. In neurodegenerative disorders, brain cells
produce CRP and other complement proteins leading to
chronic inflammation and potentially neuronal cell death
[56, 57]. Direct reduction of CRP may be neuroprotective;
therefore, the present data suggest that chronic adminis-
tration of PSE and the resulting improvements on CRP
may indirectly contribute to improvements in choice reac-
tion performance via reduction of the low-level inflamma-
tion in young, healthy individuals.
The results from the safety blood panel demonstrated
that supplementation with PSE for 90 days does not
negatively affect complete blood count, complete meta-
bolic profile, blood lipids, or vital signs. PSE has been
shown to be well tolerated in previous studies and the
current trial expands upon the body of evidence sup-
porting safety [34–36].
There are limitations regarding interpretation of the re-
sults in the current study. First, data collection occurred
over a period of several months, which meant that the
same laboratory personnel were not able to conduct all the
Makoto testing. Therefore, variability in results may have
increased due to multiple testing administrators and some
variation in their testing approach. However, to minimize
variability, all testing administrators were trained by the
same person and using the same exact protocols. Second,
within subject motivation can be challenging to maintain,
especially when testing visits occur months apart, and can
affect test scores. To keep participants motivated, re-
searchers utilized verbal cues to keep participants engaged
and encouraged. Future studies could involve some sub-
jective measurement of motivation to ensure consistency
across visits. Third, even though a familiarization visit was
utilized as recommended by previous reliability studies
[47], learning effects could have occurred throughout the
study.
Learning effects should have
been
consistent
amongst groups; therefore, comparison to a placebo group
should have negated the impact of the learning effects.
Conclusion
The present study is the first to observe an improvement in
reactive agility following consumption of 900 mg of PSE for
90 days, as measured by the Makoto device using both the
stationary test and the multi-directional test with footplates
at selected timepoints. By demonstrating improvements on
specific measurements of choice reaction performance in a
young, healthy population, the findings of the present study
expand on previous studies on PSE which showed improve-
ment in cognitive function. The present study supports the
use of PSE as a safe nootropic with potential downstream
benefits in athletic performance, particularly in combat
sports. Future research should be conducted to verify the
hypothesis that the measured improvements in reactive
agility will indeed translate to statistically significant and
practically relevant improvements in athletic performance.
