IMPORTANCE Physicians often report practicing defensive medicine to reduce malpractice
risk, including performing expensive but marginally beneficial tests and procedures. Although
there is little evidence that malpractice reform affects overall health care spending, it may
influence physician behavior for specific conditions involving clinical uncertainty.
OBJECTIVE To examine whether reducing malpractice risk is associated with clinical decisions
involving coronary artery disease testing and treatment.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Difference-in-differences design, comparing
physician-specific changes in coronary artery disease testing and treatment in 9 new-cap
states that adopted damage caps between 2003 and 2005 with 20 states without caps. We
used the 5% national Medicare fee-for-service random sample between 1999 and 2013.
Physicians (n = 75 801; 36 647 in new-cap states) who ordered or performed 2 or more
coronary angiographies. Data were analyzed from June 2015 to January 2018.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Changes in ischemic evaluation rates for possible coronary
artery disease, type of initial evaluation (stress testing or coronary angiography), progression
from stress test to angiography, and progression from ischemic evaluation to
revascularization (percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary artery bypass grafting).
RESULTS We studied 36 647 physicians in new-cap states and 39 154 physicians in no-cap
states. New-cap states had younger populations, more minorities, lower per-capita incomes,
fewer physicians per capita, and lower managed care penetration. Following cap adoption,
new-cap physicians reduced invasive testing (angiography) as a first diagnostic test compared
with control physicians (relative change, −24%; 95% CI, −40% to −7%; P = .005) with an
offsetting increase in noninvasive stress testing (7.8%; 95% CI, −3.6% to 19.3%; P = .17), and
referred fewer patients for angiography following stress testing (−21%; 95% CI, −40% to
−2%; P = .03). New-cap physicians also reduced revascularization rates after ischemic
evaluation (−23%; 95% CI, −40% to −4%; P = .02; driven by fewer percutaneous coronary
interventions). Changes in overall ischemic evaluation rates were similar for new-cap and
control physicians (−0.05%; 95% CI, −8.0% to 7.9%; P = .98).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Physicians substantially altered their approach to coronary
artery disease testing and follow-up after initial ischemic evaluations following adoption of
damage caps. They performed a similar number of ischemic evaluations but conducted fewer
initial left heart catheterizations, referred fewer stress-tested patients for left heart
catheterizations, and referred fewer patients for revascularization. These findings suggest
that physicians tolerate greater clinical uncertainty in coronary artery disease testing and
treatment if they face lower malpractice risk.

 P
hysicians frequently report practicing defensive medi-
cine, including ordering marginally beneficial tests and
interventions, to reduce malpractice liability.1 Imaging
and invasive diagnostic studies are often cited as overused de-
fensive measures.2
A key policy question is whether legal reforms that re-
duce malpractice risk also decrease defensive medicine.3,4
Many states have adopted noneconomic damage caps, which
limitawardstocompensatemalpracticeplaintiffsfor“painand
suffering.”3,5 These caps produce substantial declines in the
dollar amount of paid claims, which emerge gradually as pre-
cap lawsuits are resolved.5 Lower risk would be observable to
physicians through lower medical malpractice premiums6 and
local publicity about the reforms. Although early work by Kes-
sler and McClellan7,8 found that damage caps led to a 4% to
5% drop in hospital spending following a heart attack, later
studies have not found significant changes in health care
spending after cap adoption.5,9,10 However, limited effect of
damage caps on overall health care costs may obscure their
effect on specific clinical decisions.
To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine the ef-
fects of damage caps on specific testing and treatment deci-
sions for coronary artery disease (CAD). Diagnosing and treat-
ing CAD involves medical uncertainty, significant malpractice
risk, and substantial cost. Coronary artery disease is the lead-
ingcauseofdeathintheUnitedStates,andchestpainandother
symptoms suggestive of CAD are common outpatient and
emergency department symptoms.11 Because unrecognized
CAD can have catastrophic outcomes, with missed acute myo-
cardial infarction an important cause of malpractice law-
suits, physicians are understandably cautious in their testing
and intervention decisions.12
Unfortunately, CAD symptoms are variable and nonspe-
cific,clinicalguidelinesfortestingpatientswithsuspectedCAD
symptomsaregeneral,andtestresultscanbeambiguous.13Cli-
nicians must exercise judgment as to who should be tested,
what test to use initially (definitive but invasive coronary
angiography through left-heart or combined left- and right-
heart catheterization [ie, angiography] vs noninvasive stress
test), and how to treat CAD once diagnosed. Many experts be-
lieve that invasive tests and interventions are overused, with
fear of malpractice liability a potential motivating factor.14,15
We hypothesized that if physicians faced lower malprac-
tice risk, they would be willing to tolerate greater clinical
uncertainty involving CAD, including the risk of future
adverse events that earlier CAD diagnosis might have pre-
vented. They would therefore be less likely to (1) test for CAD;
(2) initiate testing with angiography rather than a noninva-
sive stress test; (3) progress patients from initial stress testing
to angiography; and (4) refer patients with borderline steno-
ses for revascularization through percutaneous coronary
intervention (PCI) or coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG).
Methods
The study was approved by the George Washington Univer-
sity and Northwestern University institutional review boards.
Because this was a retrospective study using administrative
claims, it was deemed exempt from the need for informed con-
sent. We used a difference-in-differences (DiD) research de-
sign to assess the association of damage cap adoption with
physicians’decisions to test for and treat CAD. Difference-in-
differences is a standard method for estimating the effect of
policy changes using observational data.16 We compared
changes over time in testing and progression decisions by new-
cap physicians, who practiced in 9 new-cap states, which ad-
opted damage caps between 2002 and 2005 (Nevada, 2002;
Florida, Mississippi, Ohio, Oklahoma, and Texas, 2003; and
Illinois and South Carolina, 2005), to changes over time for no-
cap physicians who practiced in 20 no-cap states, which had
no damage caps during the study period. In sensitivity analy-
ses, we also compared new-cap physicians against those in 22
old-cap states, which had caps in place throughout our study
period. The eMethods in the Supplement lists these 3 groups
ofstates(eTable1intheSupplement),providesadditionalmeth-
odologic details (eTable 2 in the Supplement), and includes re-
sults from extensive robustness checks (eTables 3-10 and
eFigures 1 and 2 in the Supplement).
After mapping physician identities across the 2007
change from Unique Physician Identification Number to
National Provider Identifier as the primary identifier, we
used physician zip code, state, and quarter fixed effects as
well as extensive patient-level and county-level covariates to
examine the association between malpractice reforms and
clinical decisions. The study design measures changes in
testing and treatment decisions by the same physicians, fol-
lowed up over time, relative to physicians seeing similar
patients in control states.
We studied rates for any ischemic evaluation (stress test
or angiography as an initial test, with no stress test in the
prior 30 days), and the choice between stress test and angiog-
raphy as the initial diagnostic test. We also assessed the pro-
portion of patients who progressed within 30 days: (1) from
stress test to angiography, (2) from angiography to revascu-
larization, and (3) from any ischemic evaluation to revascu-
larization. We studied the most common stress tests: stress
electrocardiogram, stress echocardiogram, and single-photon
emission computed tomography. We did not study positron
Key Points
Question Do physicians change testing and treatment decisions
for coronary artery disease after malpractice reform?
Findings In this study, physicians in the 9 states that adopted
damage caps between 2002 and 2005 performed a similar
number of ischemic evaluations for possible CAD but performed
fewer initial invasive coronary angiography and more noninvasive
stress tests relative to control physicians. Physicians in states that
adopted damage caps also referred fewer patients for angiography
following a stress test, and fewer patients progressed from
evaluation to revascularization.
Meaning These findings provide evidence that physicians who
face lower malpractice risk tolerate greater clinical uncertainty in
testing for and treating CAD.

Data Sources and Physician Sample
We used the 5% random sample of Medicare fee-for-service
beneficiaries (Parts A and B) between 1999 and 2013 for pa-
tients 65 years and older. This data set allows us to follow up
patients over time, includes physician identities, and covers
approximately 2 million beneficiaries annually.
Westudiedphysicianswhoorderedorperformed2ormore
angiographies during our sample period. Because we used a
5% sample of patients, a physician who orders 2 angiogra-
phies included in our data set is expected to order or perform
approximately 40 such procedures across all of their Medi-
care patients. These physicians generally include cardiolo-
gists as well as some primary care clinicians and hospitalists.
The denominator for rates is all Medicare beneficiaries seen
by an included physician.
We used Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System,
International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, and
Diagnosis Related Group codes to identify tests and proce-
dures. Medicare does not require preauthorization for the tests
and procedures we studied.

 Covariates
In addition to physician zip code, state, and calendar-quarter
fixed effects, we controlled for a broad set of both patient char-
acteristics (age, sex, race, ethnicity, and the presence of each
of the Charlson comorbidities) and county characteristics (per-
centage of patients who were men, white, black, Hispanic, dis-
abled, and aged 65-74 years, 75-84 years, and 85 years and
older; population size; physicians per capita; unemployment
rate; median household income; and managed care penetra-
tion).Thefixed-effectscontrolfortime-constantphysicianand

Statistical Analysis
Weconductedouranalysesineventtimerelativetoeachstate’
s
cap-adoption year, defined as year zero. We combined treated
and control states in a panel data set and turn-on reform for
each new-cap state in the cap-adoption year. We conducted 3
separate analyses: (1) simple DiD regressions, which measure
the mean effect of the institution of caps for physicians in new-
cap states in the postreform period (dropping year zero) rela-
tivetocontrolphysicians;(2)distributedlagregressions,which
allow the effect of caps to vary during the postreform period;
and (3) leads-and-lags regressions, which let us estimate the
effect both before and after cap adoption. We clustered stan-
dard errors on state. Analyses were performed using Stata, ver-
sion 14.0 (StataCorp). For DiD estimates, P less than .05 was
considered statistically significant.
Effect of National Factors
Several national factors besides malpractice risk may have in-
fluenced CAD testing and treatment, especially later in our
sample period. The principal factors are Appropriate Use
Criteria (AUC), adopted for single-photon emission computed
tomography in 2005 and extended to other stress tests in
200917-19;theClinicalOutcomesUtilizingRevascularizationand
Aggressive Drug Evaluation (COURAGE) trial (2007), which
found no mortality benefit from PCI for patients with stable
angina20; and the Choosing Wisely campaign (2012).21 Prac-
tice guidelines also changed for management of stable ische-
micheartdisease(2002),22PCI(2001and2007),23,24andCABG

 (2004).25 We assessed whether these national factors could ex-
plain our findings in 2 ways. First, we limited the treated states
to6statesthatadoptedcapsin2002/2003andendedthestudy
period in 2009. Second, we studied the 17 states with the high-
eststress-testingratesin2002(including8new-capstates)plus
the 17 states with the lowest rates (including the ninth new-
cap state). We then ran regressions that compared the effect of
the actual damage-cap shock with a hypothetical AUC-driven
shock in high-rate states in 2005.
Results
Our physician cohort included 75 801 physicians, of whom
about half (36 647) practiced in new-cap states. New-cap states
had younger populations, more minorities, lower per-capita
incomes, fewer physicians per capita, and lower managed care
penetration.Theyalsohadhigherbaseratesforischemicevalu-
ation, angiography, and revascularization in 2002, just be-
fore the cap adoptions we studied (Table 1). There were dif-
ferences in population testing and treatment rates between the
2 groups of states. However, our study focuses on physician
behavior, and the precap behavior of our physician sample, ie,
thefractionofeachphysician’
spatientswhoreceivedCADtests
or procedures, was similar in treated and control states.
Figure 1 shows rates in calendar time for new-cap, no-cap,
and old-cap states for any ischemic evaluation, initial angiog-
raphy, any stress test, and all angiography (either initial or fol-
lowingstresstest).Thegraphsarereasonablyparallelduringthe
prereform period (1999-2002), except for a puzzling jump in
2002 in initial angiography rates in no-cap states. This sup-
ports the parallel trends assumption underlying DiD analysis.
Table 2 shows the magnitude and statistical significance
of changes in ischemic evaluation and progression rates for
new-cap physicians relative to changes for no-cap physi-
cians. The first half of the Table presents simple-DiD regres-
sion results, which assume physician behavior changes
immediately after reform. Figures 2 and 3 present leads-and-
lags graphs in event time. These graphs show annual
changes in CAD evaluation and progression rates for new-
cap vs no-cap physicians from 4 years before cap adoption
(to assess whether pretreatment trends were parallel)
through 6 years after cap adoption and show how the esti-
mated treatment effect evolves after reform. Postcap

a Sample is 75 801 physicians (36 647
in new-cap states), between 1999
and 2013. Stress testing was defined
as stress electrocardiogram, stress
echo, and single-photon emission
computed tomography. Ischemic
evaluation was defined as stress
testing or initial coronary
angiography. Revascularization was
defined as percutaneous coronary
intervention or coronary bypass
grafting. Based on panel regressions
with physician zip code, state, and
quarter fixed effects and
patient-level and demographic
covariates. Base rate is annual
percentage rate in 2002.
Regression coefficients are for
new-cap state indicator and are
multiplied by 400 to provide annual
percentage rates. Percentage
change was defined as reported
regression coefficient/base rate. We
dropped the cap adoption year
(event year 0) for physicians in
treated states and cap reversal year
and after for states (Illinois and
Georgia) where caps were reversed
by state supreme courts.

 changes generally occurred during the first 3 postreform
years before stabilizing.
Baseline ischemic evaluation rates rose for new-cap phy-
siciansrelativetono-capphysiciansfromyear−4to−3butwere
reasonably flat for the remainder of the precap period (Table 2;
Figure 2A). These rates did not significantly change after cap
adoption (simple DiD point estimate: relative change, −0.05%;
95% CI, −8% to 8%; P = .98). However, new-cap physicians
changed the type of initial evaluation performed. During the
3 years following cap adoption, new-cap physicians ordered
fewer initial angiographies (−24%; 95% CI, −40% to −8%;
P = .005, Figure 2B) but more initial stress tests (8%; 95%
CI, −4% to 19%; P = .18, Figure 2C).
The postreform drop in initial angiographies was accom-
paniedbylowerprogressionrates.Comparedwithno-capphy-
sicians, new-cap physicians referred fewer patients for
angiography after stress testing (−21%; 95% CI, −49% to −2%;
P = .02; Figure 3A). The combination of lower initial angi-
ography rates and lower progression from stress testing to
angiography produced a large percentage decline in overall an-
giographyratesaftercapadoption(−21%;95%CI,−31%to−5%;
P = .01; Figure 2D). Additionally, fewer patients progressed
from any ischemic evaluation to revascularization (−26%; 95%
CI, −45% to −6%; P = .01; Figure 3B and C). The lower revas-
cularization rates are driven by fewer PCIs; CABG rates did not
change (eAppendix in the Supplement).
The second half of Table 2 presents distributed-lag regres-
sionresults,whichallowthereformeffecttophaseinovertime.
The estimated percentage changes were generally larger in
magnitude than in the simple-DiD results. For example, ini-
tial angiography as a fraction of ischemic evaluation declined
by 32.8% (95% CI, −54.0% to −11.6%; P < .001) and progres-

Graphs show differences in ischemic evaluation rates as an absolute percentage
of patients receiving the indicated test or procedure, for physicians in 9
new-cap states and 20 no-cap states, from leads and lags regressions with
physician fixed effects and covariates (indicated in the text), for 75 801
physicians who ordered or performed at least 2 angiographies (36 925 in the
new-cap states). Years are in event time relative to cap adoption year. Relative
rate for year −3 is set to zero. Squares show annual point estimates, vertical
lines show 95% confidence intervals. Ischemic evaluation was defined as stress
testing (stress electrocardiogram, stress echocardiogram, or single-photon
emission computed tomography) or angiography. Number of precap years with
available data are 3 to 5 depending on each new-cap state’

 tion has 3 possible channels: fewer initial angiographies, less
progression from stress testing to angiography, and less pro-
gression from angiography to revascularization. The first 2
channels are statistically significant. The third is direction-
ally consistent (−8%; 95% CI, −26% to 9%; P = .31; Figure 3C).
Effect of National Factors
Our principal results remain statistically strong after allowing
for the potential effects of the national factors discussed in the
Methods section. First, the effect of damage caps appears by
eventyear3(2005-2006)andthusprecedestheCOURAGEtrial,
Choosing Wisely, and the 2009 expansion of AUCs (Figures 2
and 3). Second, new-cap states have higher population stress
testing rates (Table 1). They might therefore have experienced
greater rate reductions in response to national factors. How-
ever,insensitivitytests(eFigure3intheSupplement),wefound
no evidence that either the 2005 AUC or later national factors
had a larger effect in high-rate than in low-rate states.
Additional Sensitivity Analyses
We conducted extensive additional sensitivity analyses, re-
ported in the eAppendix in the Supplement. First, we used a
broader control group (no-cap states plus old-cap states), and
a narrower control group (9 no-cap states, chosen for geo-
graphic and cultural similarity to the new-cap states) (eFig-
ure4intheSupplement).Second,westudiedbothbroaderand
narrower physician cohorts (eFigure 5 in the Supplement).
Third, we ran leave-one-out regressions, in which we re-
moved individual states from the treatment group. Fourth, we
used county as place of service (instead of state) fixed effects.
Our findings were consistent across these variations.
Discussion
Physiciansoftenreportpracticingdefensivemedicine,butpre-
vious studies of damage caps and other malpractice reforms
show little evidence that malpractice reform affects overall
health care spending. Prior studies, except for those focusing
on cesarean section rates, have also not assessed whether and
how changes in malpractice risk alter specific clinical deci-
sions under uncertainty.26-30 We studied specific cardiac care
decisions that involve both significant clinical uncertainty and
substantial malpractice risk.
Following cap adoption, overall ischemic testing rates re-
mained constant, but testing became less invasive, and revas-
cularization through PCI, following initial testing, declined.
These findings suggest that physicians are willing to tolerate
greaterclinicaluncertaintyinCADtestingiftheyfacelowermal-
practice risk. Our confidence intervals are wide, but even their
upperboundssuggestmeaningfulchangesinclinicalbehavior.
Stress tests are less definitive than angiography for diag-
nosing CAD.31-33 For example, stress tests only provide evi-
dence on obstructive CAD, and single-photon emission
computed tomography may produce ambiguous findings be-
cause of ramp or motion artifacts, obesity, and breast or dia-
phragmatic attenuation.34 Physicians were more willing to tol-
erate this uncertainty after cap adoption. Referrals from initial

 stress test to angiography also fell substantially, although re-
duced use as an initial test should have increased the fraction
of stress tests producing abnormal or marginal results.
New-cap physicians also accepted greater clinical uncer-
tainty in treating CAD after diagnosis. Obstructive CAD may
betreatedmedicallyorwithrevascularization.However,many
patients incorrectly believe that PCI for stable obstructive CAD
reduces AMI risk.35,36 Many cardiologists also perceive per-
forming PCI, or referring for CABG, as reducing malpractice
risk. After cap adoption, fewer patients in new-cap states pro-
gressed from ischemic evaluation to revascularization, sug-
gesting greater reliance on medical treatment.
This study spans a period during which multiple factors
other than introduction of damage caps might have differen-
tially affected new-cap vs old-cap states, particularly be-
cause the new-cap states had higher baseline testing and in-
tervention levels than control states. However, in extensive
robustness checks, we find no evidence that the AUC, the
COURAGE trial, or the Choosing Wisely campaign account for
our findings.
Our finding that reducing malpractice was associated with
a lower intensity of CAD testing and treatment has important
policy implications. A 2011 study found that 12% of PCIs for
nonacute indications were inappropriate.37,38 Moreover, is-
chemic evaluation and revascularization rates are far lower in
Medicare Advantage plans than in Medicare fee-for-service,
which suggests overuse in Medicare fee-for-service.39 Curtail-
ing marginal or unnecessary angiography and revasculariza-
tion spares patients invasive procedures and associated risk
andsavesresources.Inaddition,boththeDepartmentofHealth
and Human Services and commercial payers are moving rap-
idly toward alternate payment models.40 A core issue for these
models is provider resistance to changing established prac-
ticepatterns.Ourstudysuggeststhatphysicianswhofacelower
malpractice risk may be less concerned with that risk, and thus
more receptive to new care delivery strategies associated with
alternate payment models.41,42
Limitations
Our study has several limitations. The modest number of new-
cap states is an inherent limitation of a DiD design based on
state-level reforms. A core DiD assumption is parallel trends:
both groups of states would have followed similar CAD test-
ing and treatment trends without cap adoption.16 This as-
sumption cannot be formally tested, but an important check
is whether prereform trends appear reasonably parallel. They
appear parallel for angiography (Figure 2B), but a rising rela-
tive pretreatment trend for stress testing (Figure 2C) could
partly explain the postcap rise in stress tests that we found.
We studied testing and treatment decisions by the same
physicians in the same locations. We did not study physi-
cians who moved between states, but noted that movement
between no-cap and new-cap states was limited (eFigure 6 in
the Supplement). We lack clinical data and could not assess the
appropriatenessoftestingortreatment.Thestudywasalsonot
designed to assess health outcomes.
Westudiedthethirdwaveofcapadoptions,between2002
and 2005. Since 2010, there has been accelerated integration
ofcardiologypracticesintohospitalsandlargerpracticegroups.
Physician responses to caps could depend on their practice
setting, but we lack data on practice settings and cannot test
this possibility. We studied only Medicare fee-for-service pa-
tients, older than 65 years. Physicians may behave differ-
ently for younger patients or for those insured by other pay-
ers;forexample,commercialpayersmayhavepreauthorization
requirements.
As with all observational studies, we cannot account for
unobserved variables. However, our models use physician zip
code,geographic,andquarterfixedeffectsandextensivetime-
varying covariates to control for factors that may have influ-
enced CAD testing and treatment. Mean comorbidity scores
moved in parallel for new-cap and no-cap states (eFigure 7 in
the Supplement). Our results were robust to numerous sensi-
tivity analyses.
Conclusions
We studied the association of damage caps with specific car-
diac care decisions that involve clinical uncertainty, high
patient risks, and significant malpractice risk. To our knowl-
edge, ours is the first paper to show changes in clinical behav-
ior following up cap adoption in the particular setting of CAD
testing and treatment. We found evidence that physicians al-
tered their CAD testing and intervention practices following
adoption of damage caps. Overall testing rates did not change,
but testing became less invasive (fewer initial angiographies
and less progression from initial stress test to angiography),
and revascularization through PCI following initial testing de-
clined. These findings suggest that physicians are willing to
tolerate greater clinical uncertainty in CAD testing and treat-
ment if they face lower malpractice risk.
