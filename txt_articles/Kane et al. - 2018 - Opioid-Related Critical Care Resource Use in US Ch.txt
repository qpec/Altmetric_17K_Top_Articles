BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: There has been a rapid increase in the rate of pediatric opioid-
related hospitalizations. It is unknown how this increase has impacted the use of pediatric 
critical care. Our objective in this study was to assess the trends in pediatric hospitalization 
for opioid ingestions in a cohort of US children’s hospitals and, specifically, to evaluate the 
impact on pediatric critical care resource use.
METHODS: A retrospective cohort study of the Pediatric Health Information System was 
performed to identify hospitalizations for opioid ingestions from 2004 to 2015. Admission 
to the PICU and the use of naloxone, vasopressors, and ventilation were assessed by using 
billing data. The primary outcome measure was the trend in the rate of PICU admission for 
opioid-related ingestion over time, assessed by using Poisson regression.
RESULTS: There were 3647 opioid-related hospitalizations in 31 hospitals; 42.9% required 
PICU care. The overall mortality was 1.6%, with annual deaths decreasing from 2.8% to 
1.3% (P < .001). The number of opioid-related hospitalizations requiring PICU care doubled 
between 2004 and 2015. The rate of PICU admission for opioid-related hospitalization 
increased significantly, from 24.9 to 35.9 per 10 000 PICU admissions (P < .001). Among 
PICU admissions, 37.0% required mechanical ventilator support, and 20.3% required 
vasopressors.
CONCLUSIONS: The US opioid crisis is negatively impacting children, and the rate of 
hospitalization and PICU admission for pediatric opioid ingestions is increasing. Current 
efforts to reduce adult opioid use have not curtailed the incidence of pediatric opioid 
ingestions, and additional efforts are needed to reduce preventable opioid exposure in 
children.

WHAT’S KNOWN ON THIS SUBJECT: Currently, there 
is an opioid epidemic in the United States. Pediatric 
exposure to these drugs has been associated with a 
rapid increase in the annual rate of pediatric opioid-
related hospitalizations.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: This is the first study 
to assess PICU resource use because of opioid 
ingestion. Between 2004 and 2015, PICU admissions 
for opioid ingestion increased by 35%, with a 
concomitant increase in mechanical ventilation and 
vasopressors but reduced costs per PICU admission.

 The number of deaths in the United 
States that are attributable to opioid 
medications has doubled since 2000.1, 
 
2  
Drug poisonings, and specifically 
prescription opioids, are resulting in 
the fastest increase in medication-
related deaths in the United States.3,4 
Despite a number of high-profile 
prevention strategies, poisonings from 
prescription medications continue to 
be a major cause of morbidity among 
children.5 Emergency department (ED) 
utilization has increased as a result of 
opioid-related poisonings in both adult 
and pediatric populations; prescription 
medications are the leading cause 
for young children, with opioids 
surpassing other pharmaceutical 
categories.6,7 Opioid exposures 
in children up to 6 years of age 
accounted for the highest number of 
pediatric patients affected, followed 
by teenagers.7,8
A recent study of US hospital 
discharge records found that in 
pediatric patients under 19 years old, 
the incidence of prescription opioid-
related hospitalization for ingestions 
and poisonings doubled between 
1997 and 2012, with the largest 
percentage increase found in children 
under 5 years compared to older 
children and teenagers.9 Additionally, 
there has been a worrisome increase 
in the adult intensive care mortality 
from opioid overdose.10 It is unknown 
whether this trend, either in-hospital 
mortality or the need for critical 
care, is also occurring in the pediatric 
population. Understanding these 
trends is essential for appropriate 
planning within the pediatric critical 
care community. It is also essential to 
understand the financial contribution 
of complex and expensive multiorgan 
care provided in the PICU relative 
to overall hospital-associated costs 
of opioid-related hospitalization so 
that cost-reduction strategies can be 
implemented.
Little is known about the 
epidemiology of opioid ingestions 
among admissions to PICUs in the 
United States. Thus, our purpose in 
this study was to assess the trends in 
pediatric hospitalization from opioid 
ingestion in a cohort of US children’s 
hospitals and, specifically, to evaluate 
the impact on pediatric critical care 
resource use. We hypothesized that 
opioid-related admissions to the PICU 
have increased significantly over time 
as has critical care resource use.
METHODS
Data Source
This was a retrospective cohort study 
of the Pediatric Health Information 
System (PHIS) database. The PHIS 
contains administrative and billing 
data from 49 tertiary-care children’s 
hospitals located in 27 states and 
the District of Columbia. Admissions 
to children’s hospitals with data 
provided to the PHIS account for 
∼20% of all pediatric hospitalizations 
in the United States.11 The database 
contains encounter-level data, 
including demographics, up to 
41 International Classification of 
Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) 
and International Classification of 
Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10) 
diagnoses, and up to 41 ICD-9 and 
ICD-10 procedure codes.12 Daily 
billing data and daily indicators 
of PICU use are also present. Data 
are deidentified before inclusion in 
the database; however, encrypted 
medical record numbers allow for 
tracking individual patients across 
hospital visits and admissions. The 
Children’s Hospital Association 
(Lenexa, KS) and participating 
hospitals jointly ensure the 
quality and integrity of the data, 
as previously described.13 The 
University of Chicago Institutional 
Review Board determined this study 
to be exempt from review.
Population and Selection Criteria
All inpatient and observation 
encounters of children aged 1 to 
17 years that were included in 
the PHIS from January 1, 2004, to 
September 30, 2015, were included 
from the 31 hospitals that provided 
continuous data during this period. 
We identified hospitalizations that 
were attributed to opioid toxicity, 
either via prescription or illicit drugs, 
by means of a previously validated 
case-identification schema by using 
specific International Classification 
of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical 
Modification (ICD-9-CM) diagnostic 
codes (or their International 
Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, 
Clinical Modification equivalents 
using available crosswalks): E850.0 
(accidental poisoning by heroin), 
E850.1 (accidental poisoning by 
methadone), E850.2 (accidental 
poisoning by another opioid), 965.00 
(poisoning by opium), 965.01 
(poisoning by heroin), 965.02 
(poisoning by methadone), or 965.09 
(poisoning by other opiates).10, 
 
14 
Hospital costs were estimated from 
charges by using hospital- and year-
specific cost-to-charge ratios and 
inflated to 2015 dollars by using the 
medical component of the consumer 
price index. Admission to the PICU 
and the use of naloxone, vasopressors, 
and mechanical ventilation (invasive 
and noninvasive) were assessed by 
using billing data.
Outcome Measures
The primary outcome measure was 
the rate of PICU admission for opioid 
ingestion per 10 000 PICU admissions 
over the study period. Secondary 
outcomes included in-hospital 
mortality, total and PICU-associated 
costs and length of stay, and the 
use of vasopressors, naloxone, and 
mechanical ventilation.
Statistics
To aid in bivariate analyses, 
years were grouped into epochs 
of 2004 to 2007, 2008 to 2011, 
and 2012 to 2015. Categorical 
variables were summarized with 
frequencies and percentages and 
compared across epochs by using 
χ2 statistics. Continuous variables 
were summarized with medians

 and interquartile ranges and then 
compared with Kruskal–Wallis 
tests. Trends in the annual rates 
of opioid-related hospitalizations 
were assessed with generalized 
estimating equations to account for 
patient clustering within a hospital, 
assuming an underlying Poisson 
distribution. All statistical analyses 
were performed by using SAS version 
9.2 (SAS Institute, Inc, Cary, NC), and 
P values of <.05 were considered 
statistically significant.
RESULTS
Of 4 175 624 hospital admissions 
to 31 different children’s hospitals 
during the study period, 3647 
(0.09%) patients were admitted 
for opioid-related conditions. 
The number of opioid-related 
hospitalizations increased across the 
epochs from 797 to 1504 (Table 1). 
When combining all the years, there 
were 8.7 opioid-related admissions 
per 10 000 hospital admissions,  
with the rate of hospitalization 
increasing significantly from 6.7 per 
10 000 admissions in 2004 to 10.9 
per 10 000 admissions in 2015  
(P < .001). Although the majority of 
opioid-related hospitalizations were 
of children between 12 and 17 years 
of age in all time periods, one-third of 
the hospitalizations were of children 
<6 years old. The subtype of opioid 
ingested differed by age group, with 
19.5% (243 of 1249) of patients 1 
to 5 years old ingesting methadone, 
whereas methadone only accounted 
for 9.8% (218 of 2223) of ingestions 
in the 12- to 17-year-old group. 
Heroin accounted for 4.4% (99 of 
2223) of patient hospitalizations for 
the 12- to 17-year-old age group.
A total of 501 831 patients (12%) 
required admission to the PICU during 
the study period, and 1564 patients 
with opioid-related hospitalizations 
(43%) required PICU care (Table 2). 
Opioid ingestions accounted for 31.2 
per 10 000 PICU admissions. The rate 
of PICU admission for opioid-related 
hospitalization increased significantly, 
from 24.9 to 35.9 per 10 000 PICU 
admissions (P < .001), with a peak of 
36.6 per 10 000 PICU admissions in 
2014 (Fig 1). The number of patients 
requiring PICU care nearly doubled

Downloaded from 
 between 2004 and 2015, but the 
relative percentage of children with 
opioid-related hospitalizations 
requiring PICU care was similar 
across all years. The median cost per 
PICU admission was $4931, with a 
significant decrease from $6253 in 
the 2004–2007 epoch to $4552 in the 
2012–2015 epoch (P < .001). Overall, 
37% of PICU admissions required 
mechanical ventilator support, and 
this decreased over time (P < .001). Of 
the PICU admissions, 20% required 
vasopressors, and this also decreased 
over time (P < .001).
The overall mortality was 1.6%, 
with deaths decreasing from 2.8% 
in the 2004–2007 epoch to 1.3% in 
the 2012–2015 epoch (Table 3). In 
the 1- to 5-year-old age group, the 
average mortality was 1.4%, with 
a significant decrease over time 
(P < .001). There was a significant 
decrease in the number of patients 
who were discharged directly home 
from the hospital, with an increase 
in the number of patients who were 
sent to other care facilities, including 
skilled nursing, long-term care, and 
inpatient psychiatric facilities (P < 
.001; Table 4).
DISCUSSION
We present the first study of the 
impact of the current US opioid 
crisis on the pediatric critical care 
community using a national sample 
of patients who were admitted to 
major pediatric hospitals. In this 
study, we demonstrate a significant 
and steady increase in the diagnosis 
of opioid ingestion and poisoning 
across all age groups in US children’s 
hospitals from 2004 to 2015. Not 
only did the absolute number of 
opioid-related admissions increase 
but the rate of both hospital and PICU 
admissions increased as well. The 
opioid-related hospital admission 
rate increase of 39% is substantial 
as is the 35% increase in the rate of

Downloaded from 
 PICU admissions for opioid-ingestion. 
This increase in PICU use parallels 
the increase in hospital admissions 
and is consistent with previously 
published data that reveal an 
increase in the annual incidence of 
hospitalizations and ED encounters 
for opioid poisoning in children.7, 
 
9
The percentage of PICU patients 
requiring mechanical ventilation 
decreased over time, from nearly 
half of PICU admissions to only 
one-third. The percentage of PICU 
admissions for opioid ingestion 
requiring vasopressors also fell by 
nearly half. However, because of the 
increase in the number of patients 
with opioid-related hospitalizations 
requiring PICU care across the 
study period, the absolute number 
of patients with opioid ingestion 
requiring mechanical ventilation and 
vasopressors increased over time. 
The median cost of care decreased 
significantly during the study 
period, likely because of a shorter 
overall hospital length of stay. 
However, because of the increases 
in all hospitalizations and those 
hospitalizations requiring critical 
care for opioid ingestion, the actual 
overall financial burden on the health 
system increased. Additionally, the 
total number of hospital days that 
were attributed to patients with 
opioid ingestion and the total number 
of patients requiring mechanical 
ventilators and/or vasopressors 
continue to increase over time at an 
alarming rate.
The only other data that reveal the 
impact of the US opioid crisis on 
critical care resource use are from 
the adult population.10 Stevens et 
al10 found that there was a marked 
increase in critically ill adult patients 
who were admitted to the ICU with 
overdoses from opioids between 
2009 and 2015, with an increase 
in mortality and a near doubling 
of ICU deaths. In addition, the total 
cost of care increased by 58% in the 
adult ICUs over that same period. In 
contrast, although the total number 
of pediatric patients admitted to the 
PICU has also increased significantly, 
the pediatric health care system has 
become more efficient, with lower 
lengths of stay per hospitalization, 
less mechanical ventilation per 
hospitalization, less vasopressor 
use per hospitalization, and 
reduced mortality over time. The 
underlying cause of the difference 
between adult and pediatric critical 
care outcomes is likely due to the 
difference in the opioid class leading 
to hospitalization. In this study, 
methadone and other opioids were 
the major contributors to pediatric 
hospitalization, whereas in the 
adult study, heroin was shown 
to be the key driver to adult ICU 
hospitalization and mortality. Adult 
heroin users are likely to have a 
number of clinical comorbidities 
that may contribute to their 
increased cost of care. Additionally, 
illicit heroin can be contaminated 
with other opioid and nonopioid 
substances that may make its 
use more lethal compared with 
regulated prescription drugs, such as 
methadone.
The increasing number of adult drug 
prescriptions is strongly associated 
with rising pediatric exposures and 
poisonings; young children are at 
the greatest risk for exposure, with 
substantial health care use and

 morbidity specifically associated with 
opioid ingestions.6 The exploratory 
nature of young children makes 
them particularly vulnerable to 
harm from accidental medication 
ingestions as opposed to adolescents 
and teenagers, who are more likely 
to have intentional ingestions, 
including for recreational purposes 
or for self-harm.5, 
 
15 We identified 
methadone ingestions, in particular, 
as an important driver for hospital 
care, with nearly 20% of children 
<6 years of age being admitted with 
methadone ingestion. From 2000 
to 2007, the US Drug Enforcement 
Administration data showed a 
559% increase in prescriptions 
for methadone; these data help to 
inform the findings in this study.8 
Additionally, data from the American 
Association of Poison Control 
Centers revealed that methadone 
was responsible for 24.9% of serious 
medical outcomes in all patients who 
are admitted to health care facilities, 
which is consistent with our finding 
of 20%.7
Insurance coverage for the majority 
of pediatric patients in this study 
who were hospitalized with opioid 
ingestion was provided by Medicaid. 
The percentage of patients with 
opioid ingestion who have Medicaid 
as the primary payer source has 
increased over time. Additionally, 
66.5% of patients <6 years of age 
were covered by Medicaid. In the 
current health care climate, in which 
proposed changes to the funding of 
state-based Medicaid programs is 
under consideration, any reduction 
of Medicaid funding could have a 
profound impact on the ability to 
recuperate the cost of acute hospital 
care that is associated with pediatric 
opioid ingestions.
There are a number of limitations to 
this study. First, the PHIS database 
offers the unique advantage of 
detailed, national-level, pediatric 
data from the majority of US 
metropolitan areas. The PHIS 
provides up to 21 diagnosis codes 
per hospitalization and provides 
more diagnostic data per patient 
than most administrative data 
sets. However, the data provide an 
unweighted convenience sample 
because member hospitals change 
over time. To control for this, only 
those data from member hospitals 
that enrolled patients throughout 
the entire study period were 
included. Additionally, the data may 
not be generalizable to nontertiary-
care, nonchildren’s hospitals. For 
example, because of referral bias, 
the PHIS may overrepresent the 
true incidence of opioid ingestions 
requiring PICU care. Also, because 
the PHIS data represent ∼20% of 
all pediatric hospitalizations in 
the United States, the total cost 
burden to the US health care system 
is clearly understated. Second, 
case identification is dependent 
on ICD-9-CM codes, which, like all 
administrative data, rely on accurate 
coding. Errors of both miscoding and 
the omission of key codes may occur. 
However, the search strategy used in 
this study has now been employed 
in a number of publications and has 
previously been validated in the 
literature. Additionally, validation 
studies involving other common 
medication poisonings support 
the use of ICD-9-CM codes for the 
identification of hospitalizations for 
medication toxicities in children.16 
Because of the limitations of the 
ICD-9 and ICD-10 coding system, 
the identities of the specific opioids 
ingested are unknown. It is possible 
that other data may better inform 
which specific agents are key drivers 
to pediatric hospitalization and PICU 
resource use, and they may provide 
targets for strategic public health 
initiatives.
The current US opioid crisis is 
negatively impacting pediatric 
patients as the rate of hospitalization 
and PICU care for the ingestion 
of opioids by children continues 
to increase over time. With 
higher volumes of patients being 
admitted to the PICU because of 
opioid ingestion, the overall use of 
pediatric critical care resources, 
including mechanical ventilation and 
vasopressors, has increased over 
time, although efficiencies in both 
life-sustaining interventions and the 
total cost of care per patient have 
improved. Current efforts to reduce 
prescription opioid use in adults 
have not curtailed the incidence 
of pediatric opioid ingestion, and 
additional efforts are needed to 
reduce preventable opioid exposure 
in children.
