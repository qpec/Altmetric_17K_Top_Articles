 Fentanyl Law Enforcement 
Submissions and Increases in 
Synthetic Opioid–Involved Overdose 
Deaths — 27 States, 2013–2014

In March and October 2015, the Drug Enforcement 
Administration (DEA) and CDC, respectively, issued 
nationwide alerts identifying illicitly manufactured fen-
tanyl (IMF) as a threat to public health and safety (1,2). 
IMF is unlawfully produced fentanyl, obtained through 
International Overdose 
Awareness Day — August 31, 2016
August 31 is International Overdose Awareness Day, 
a global event that aims to raise awareness that overdose 
death is preventable. Goals include providing awareness 
regarding the risk for overdose, providing information on 
community services, and preventing and reducing drug-
related harm by supporting evidence-based policy and 
practice (http://www.overdoseday.com).
In 2015, the Drug Enforcement Administration and 
CDC released alerts identifying illicitly manufactured fen-
tanyl as a threat to public health and safety (1,2). Although 
fentanyl is available as a prescription medication for 
treating severe pain, including cancer-related pain, the 
current epidemic of synthetic opioid–involved overdose 
deaths largely involves illicitly manufactured fentanyl that 
is mixed with or sold as heroin (1,3).
In contrast to the 2005–2007 fentanyl overdose outbreak, 
when deaths were confined to several states, the current epi-
demic is unprecedented in scope and, as described in a report 
in this issue of MMWR, multiple states in several regions of 
the United States are reporting substantial increases in fatal 
synthetic opioid–involved overdoses, primarily driven by 
fentanyl-involved overdose deaths. Further information and 
data about fentanyl from CDC are available at http://www.
cdc.gov/drugoverdose/opioids/fentanyl.html.

illicit drug markets, includes fentanyl analogs, and is com-
monly mixed with or sold as heroin (1,3,4). Starting in 
2013, the production and distribution of IMF increased 
to unprecedented levels, fueled by increases in the global 
supply, processing, and distribution of fentanyl and 
fentanyl-precursor chemicals by criminal organizations 
(3). Fentanyl is a synthetic opioid 50–100 times more 
potent than morphine (2).* Multiple states have reported 
increases in fentanyl-involved overdose (poisoning) deaths 
(fentanyl deaths) (2). This report examined the number 
of drug products obtained by law enforcement that tested 
positive for fentanyl (fentanyl submissions) and synthetic 
opioid–involved deaths other than methadone (syn-
thetic opioid deaths), which include fentanyl deaths and 
deaths involving other synthetic opioids (e.g., tramadol). 
Fentanyl deaths are not reported separately in national 
data. Analyses also were conducted on data from 27 states† 
with consistent death certificate reporting of the drugs 
involved in overdoses. Nationally, the number of fentanyl 
submissions and synthetic opioid deaths increased by 
426% and 79%, respectively, during 2013–2014; among 
the 27 analyzed states, fentanyl submission increases were 
strongly correlated with increases in synthetic opioid 
deaths. Changes in fentanyl submissions and synthetic 
opioid deaths were not correlated with changes in fentanyl 
prescribing rates, and increases in fentanyl submissions 
and synthetic opioid deaths were primarily concentrated 
in eight states (high-burden states). Reports from six of the 
eight high-burden states indicated that fentanyl-involved 
overdose deaths were primarily driving increases in syn-
thetic opioid deaths. Increases in synthetic opioid deaths 
among high-burden states disproportionately involved 
persons aged 15–44 years and males, a pattern consistent 
with previously documented IMF-involved deaths (5). 
These findings, combined with the approximate doubling 
in fentanyl submissions during 2014–2015 (from 5,343 to 
13,882) (6), underscore the urgent need for a collaborative 
public health and law enforcement response.
Data were analyzed from four sources: 1) fentanyl submission 
data from the DEA National Forensic Laboratory Information 
System (NFLIS), which systematically collects drug identification 
results from drug cases submitted for analysis to forensic labora-
tories§; 2) synthetic opioid deaths, calculated using the National 
Vital Statistics System multiple cause-of-death mortality files¶;

3) national and state fentanyl prescription data that are estimated 
from IMS Health’s National Prescription Audit collecting 87% 
of retail prescriptions in the United States**; and 4) medical 
examiner/coroner reports or death certificate data from states 
with a high burden of synthetic opioid deaths (i.e., a 1-year 
increase in synthetic opioid deaths exceeding two per 100,000 
residents, or a 1-year increase of ≥100 synthetic opioid deaths 
during 2013–2014). Synthetic opioid deaths were identified 
using the following International Classification of Diseases, 10th 
Revision codes: 1) an underlying cause-of-death code of X40–44 
(unintentional), X60–64 (suicide), X85 (homicide), or Y10–Y14 
(undetermined intent) and 2) a multiple cause-of-death code of 
T40.4. In 2014, any information on the specific drug or drugs 
involved in a drug overdose were reported for approximately 
80% of drug overdose deaths; this proportion varied over time 
and by state (7). State analyses were limited to 27 states meeting 
the following criteria: 1) >70% of drug overdose deaths reported 
at least one specific drug in 2013 and 2014; 2) the change in the 
percentage of overdose deaths reporting at least one specific drug 
from 2013 to 2014 was <10%††; 3) ≥20 synthetic opioid deaths 
occurred during 2013 and 2014; and 4) fentanyl submissions 
were reported in 2013 and 2014.§§ These 27 states accounted 
for 75% of synthetic opioid deaths in the United States in 2014. 
Analyses compared changes in the crude rate of fentanyl submis-
sions, fentanyl prescriptions, and synthetic opioid deaths during 
2013–2014 using Pearson correlations. States were classified as 
high-burden if they experienced a 1-year increase in synthetic 
opioid deaths exceeding two per 100,000 residents or a 1-year 
increase of ≥100 synthetic opioid deaths during 2013–2014. 
Additional evidence from published state medical examiner/
coroner or death certificate reports was reviewed to understand 
whether increases in synthetic opioid deaths were being primarily 
driven by fentanyl deaths and not by other synthetic opioids. 
Demographic characteristics of synthetic opioid deaths for high-
burden and low-burden states were described.
During 2013–2014, fentanyl submissions in the United States 
increased by 426%, from 1,015 in 2013 to 5,343 in 2014, and 
synthetic opioid deaths increased by 79%, from 3,105 in 2013 
to 5,544 in 2014.¶¶ In contrast, fentanyl prescription rates 
remained relatively stable (Figure 1). Although changes in fentanyl 
submissions and synthetic opioid death rates from 2013–2014 
among the 27 states were highly correlated (r = 0.95) (Figure 2), 
changes in state-level synthetic opioid deaths were not correlated 
with changes in fentanyl prescribing (data not shown). During 
2013–2014, the synthetic opioid crude death rate in the eight 
high-burden states increased 174%, from 1.3 to 3.6 per 100,000, 
and the fentanyl submissions rate increased by 1,000% from 0.5 
to 5.5 per 100,000 (Table). Six of the eight high-burden states 
reported increases in synthetic opioid death rates exceeding 2.0 
per 100,000 population, and seven states reported increases in 
deaths of ≥100.*** The eight high-burden states were located 
in the Northeast (Massachusetts, Maine, and New Hampshire), 
Midwest (Ohio), and South (Florida, Kentucky, Maryland, 
and North Carolina). Six of the eight states published data on 
fentanyl deaths from 2013 and 2014.††† Combining results 
across the state reports, total fentanyl deaths during 2013–2014 
increased by 1,008, from 392 (2013) to 1,400 (2014), and the 
increase in total fentanyl deaths was of nearly the same mag-
nitude as the increase in 966 synthetic opioid deaths in these 
states (589 [2013], 1,555 [2014]). This finding indicates that 
increases in fentanyl deaths were driving the increases in synthetic 
opioid deaths in these six states. Among high-burden states, all 
demographic groups experienced substantial increases in syn-
thetic opioid death rates. Increases of >200% occurred among 
males (227%); persons aged 15–24 years (347%), 25–34 years

†† The analysis excluded states whose reporting of any specific drug or drugs 
involved in an overdose changed by >10% from 2013 to 2014. These states 
were excluded because drug specific overdose numbers and rates, including 
the number and rate synthetic opioid–involved overdose deaths, were expected 
to change substantially from 2013 to 2014 because of changes in reporting.
 
§§ 38 states reported specific drugs on ≥70% of drug overdoses in 2013 and 2014, 
but only 36 of these states experienced changes in drug reporting of <10 
percentage points from 2013 to 2014. Among these 36 states, only 30 reported 
≥20 synthetic opioid–involved overdose deaths in 2013 and 2014, and 27 of 
these 30 states had fentanyl submissions in both 2013 and 2014.
 ¶¶ Reported drug submissions to NFLIS decreased from 1.54 million in 2013 
to 1.51 million in 2014 suggesting that the increase in fentanyl submissions 
was not driven by general increases in drug submissions to NFLIS. https://

(248%), and 35–44 (230%) years; Hispanics (290%), and 
persons living in large fringe metro areas (230%).§§§ The high-
est rates of synthetic opioid deaths in 2014 were among males 
(5.1 per 100,000); non-Hispanics whites (4.6 per 100,000); 
and persons aged 25–34 years (8.3 per 100,000), 35–44 years 
(7.4 per 100,000), and 45–54 years (5.7 per 100,000) (Table).
Discussion
In the 27 states meeting analysis criteria, synthetic opioid 
deaths sharply increased in the eight high-burden states, and 
complementary data suggest this increase can be attributed 
to fentanyl. Six of the eight high-burden states reported 
substantial increases in fentanyl deaths during 2013–2014, 
based on medical examiner/coroner data or literal text searches 
of death certificates. The high potency of fentanyl and the 
possibility of rapid death after fentanyl administration (8), 
coupled with the extremely sharp 1-year increase in fentanyl 
deaths in high-burden states, highlights the need 
to understand the factors driving this increase.
IMF production and distribution began 
increasing in 2013 and has grown to unprec-
edented levels in 2016 (3). For example, there 
were approximately eight times as many fentanyl 
submissions in 2015 as there were in 2006 dur-
ing the last multistate outbreak involving IMF 
(3). DEA has not reported a sharp increase 
in pharmaceutical fentanyl being diverted 
from legitimate medical use to illegal uses (4). 
Given the strong correlation between increases 
in fentanyl submissions (primarily driven by 
IMF) (3,4) and increases in synthetic opioid 
deaths (primarily fentanyl deaths), and uncor-
related stable fentanyl prescription rates, it is 
hypothesized that IMF is driving the increases 
in fentanyl deaths. Findings from DEA (3,4), 
state, and CDC investigations (5) document-
ing the role of IMF in the observed increases in 
fentanyl deaths further support this hypothesis. 
The demographics of synthetic opioid deaths 
are rapidly changing and are consistent with 
the changes in demographics of persons using 
heroin, in particular, increasing use among 
non-Hispanic white men aged 25–44 years (9). 
Historically, the heroin market in the United 
States has been divided along the Mississippi River, with 
Mexican black tar and brown powder heroin being sold in the 
west and white powder heroin being sold in the east. IMF is 
most commonly mixed with or sold as white powder heroin (4). 
The concentration of high-burden states east of the Mississippi 
River is consistent with reports of IMF distribution in white 
powder heroin markets (3,4).
An urgent, collaborative public health and law enforcement 
response is needed to address the increasing problem of IMF 
and fentanyl deaths. Recently released fentanyl submissions 
data indicate that 15 states experienced >100 fentanyl sub-
missions in 2015. This is up from 11 states in 2014 (6). The 
national increase of 8,539 in fentanyl submissions from 2014 
(5,343) to 2015 (13,882) (6) exceeded the increase of 4,328 
from 2013 to 2014. This finding coupled with the strong cor-
relation between fentanyl submissions and fentanyl-involved 
overdose deaths observed in Ohio and Florida (5) and sup-
ported by this report likely indicate the problem of IMF is 
rapidly expanding. Recent (2016) seizures of large numbers 
of counterfeit pills containing IMF indicate that states where 
persons commonly use diverted prescription pills, including 
opioid pain relievers, might begin to experience increases 
in fentanyl deaths (3) because many counterfeit pills are

The findings in this report are subject to at least four limita-
tions. First, national vital statistics data only report synthetic 
opioid deaths. A review of state-level reports in six of eight 
high-burden states indicated that the increase in fentanyl deaths 
was the primary factor driving increases in synthetic opioid 
deaths during 2013–2014. Because synthetic opioid deaths 
include deaths involving synthetic opioids besides fentanyl, 
the absolute number of synthetic opioid deaths occurring in 
a year such as 2014 should not be considered a proxy for the

number of fentanyl deaths in a year. Second, law enforcement 
drug submissions might vary over time and geographically 
because of differences or changes in law enforcement testing 
practices and drug enforcement activity, which might underes-
timate or overestimate the number of fentanyl submissions in 
certain states. Third, findings and implications are restricted to 
27 states. Finally, testing for fentanyl deaths might vary across 
states because toxicologic testing protocols for drug overdoses 
vary across states and local jurisdictions.
The Secretary of Health and Human Services has launched 
an initiative to reduce opioid misuse, abuse, and overdose by 
expanding medication-assisted treatment, increasing the avail-
ability and use of naloxone, and promoting safer opioid pre-
scribing (10). Efforts should focus on 1) improving timeliness

 * Synthetic opioid–involved (other than methadone) overdose deaths are deaths with an International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision underlying cause-of-
death of X40–44 (unintentional), X60–64 (suicide), X85 (homicide), or Y10–Y14 (undetermined intent) and a multiple cause-of-death of T40.4.
 
† Synthetic opioid–involved overdose deaths involving persons aged ≤14 years are not reported because cells have nine or fewer deaths. Also, a small number of 
synthetic opioid–involved overdose deaths do not report age of the decedent.
 
§ Data for Hispanic origin should be interpreted with caution; studies comparing Hispanic origin on death certificates and on census surveys have indicated 
inconsistent reporting on Hispanic ethnicity. Numbers might not sum to the total because the ethnicity and race of some synthetic opioid–involved overdose 
deaths are not known.
 
¶ Drug products obtained by law enforcement that tested positive for fentanyl are referred to as fentanyl submissions. Reports were supplied by the Drug Enforcement 
Administration’s National Forensic Laboratory Information System and downloaded July 1, 2016.

of opioid surveillance to facilitate faster identification and 
response to spikes in fentanyl overdoses; 2) expanding testing 
for fentanyl and fentanyl analogs by physicians, treatment pro-
grams, and medical examiners/coroners in high-burden states; 
3) expanding evidence-based harm reduction and expand-
ing naloxone access, with a focus on persons using heroin; 
4) implementing programs that increase linkage and access to 
medication-assisted treatment, with a focus on persons using 
heroin; 5) increasing collaboration between public health and 
public safety; and 6) planning rapid response in high-burden 
states and states beginning to experience increases in fentanyl 
submissions or deaths.
Summary
What is already known about this topic?
In 2015, the Drug Enforcement Administration and CDC issued 
nationwide alerts identifying illicitly manufactured fentanyl 
(IMF) as a threat. Beginning in 2013, the distribution of IMF 
increased to unprecedented levels. Individual states have 
reported increases in fentanyl-involved overdose deaths  
(fentanyl deaths).
What is added by this report?
During 2013–2014, the number of drug products obtained 
by law enforcement that tested positive for fentanyl (fentanyl 
submissions) increased by 426%, and synthetic opioid–involved 
overdose deaths (excluding methadone) increased by 79% in 
the United States. Changes in synthetic opioid–involved over-
dose deaths among 27 states were highly correlated with fen-
tanyl submissions but not correlated with fentanyl prescribing. 
Eight high-burden states were identified, and complementary 
data indicate increases in these states are primarily attribut-
able to fentanyl, supporting the argument that IMF is driving 
increases in fentanyl deaths.
What are the implications for public health practice?
An urgent, collaborative public health and law enforcement 
response is needed, including 1) improving timeliness of opioid 
surveillance to facilitate faster identification and response to 
spikes in fentanyl overdoses; 2) expanding testing for fentanyl 
and fentanyl analogues in high-burden states; 3) expand-
ing evidence-based harm reduction and naloxone access; 
4) implementing programs that increase linkage and access 
to medication-assisted treatment; 5) increasing collaboration 
between public health and public safety; and 6) planning rapid 
response in high-burden states and states beginning to experi-
ence increases in fentanyl submissions or deaths.
