Abstract
Aim There is a requirement of an expansive and up to
date review of surgical management of inflammatory
bowel disease (IBD) that can dovetail with the medical
guidelines produced by the British Society of Gastroen-
terology.
Methods Surgeons who are members of the ACPGBI
with a recognised interest in IBD were invited to
contribute various sections of the guidelines. They
were directed to produce a procedure based docu-
ment using literature searches that were systematic,
comprehensible, transparent and reproducible. Levels
of evidence were graded. An editorial board was con-
vened to ensure consistency of style, presentation and
quality. Each author was asked to provide a set of
recommendations
which
were
evidence
based
and
unambiguous. These recommendations were submitted
to the whole guideline group and scored. They were
then refined and submitted to a second vote. Only
those
that
achieved
>80%
consensus
at
level
5
(strongly agree) or level 4 (agree) after 2 votes were
included in the guidelines.
Results All aspects of surgical care for IBD have been
included along with 157 recommendations for manage-
ment.
Conclusion These guidelines provide an up to date and
evidence based summary of the current surgical knowl-
edge in the management of IBD and will serve as a use-
ful practical text for clinicians performing this type of
surgery.

Introduction
Although guidelines exist for the surgical management
of inflammatory bowel disease [1–3] there are areas of
practice that are not covered in detail. The British Soci-
ety of Gastroenterology (BSG) have taken the view that
there should be an expanded and updated version of
the guidelines for medical management that is particu-
larly relevant to a UK audience. These BSG guidelines
will have some input from the surgical community but
there was an opportunity to expand the surgical compo-
nent. The Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) Clinical
Advisory Group of the Association of Coloproctology
of Great Britain and Ireland (ACPGBI) have therefore
commissioned a set of guidelines focusing specifically
on surgery for adults and adolescents with IBD. The
guidelines are procedure-based and are intended to
dovetail
with
the
BSG’s
comprehensive
medically
focused guidelines. The primary objective here is to
provide detailed evidence-based guidelines on the surgi-
cal management of IBD for the target audience of col-
orectal surgeons practising in Great Britain and Ireland.
Methodology
The Editorial Board was convened to ensure consistency
of style, presentation and quality across all the guide-
lines. The guidelines adhere to the published ACPGBI
guidelines on consensus statements [4] and concentrate
on surgical aspects of IBD management. Each section
was written around either a procedure or a specific situ-
ation. Authors were selected who are members of
ACPGBI and who have recognized expertise in the
management of IBD.
Specific consideration was given where possible to
indications for surgery and patient selection, technical
aspects of surgery, perioperative care, complications and
their management, and long-term outcomes. Concerns
about format and approach were discussed with the
Editorial Board. Searches for evidence in the literature
were systematic, comprehensive, transparent and repro-
ducible. Each author was asked to provide a set of rec-
ommendations
which
was
evidence-based
and
unambiguous for submission to the editorial group for
review. Consensus statements were refined and collated
by the Editorial Board.
The recommendations were then submitted to the
entire colorectal expert panel, as well as representatives
from the BSG (ABH, JKL), charitable representatives
from Crohn’s and Colitis UK (HT) and IA (the ileost-
omy and internal pouch support group) (SC), ACPGBI
patient representatives (RGA, JP, AV) and a consultant
gynaecologist and obstetrician (GWH). Voting was car-
ried out on a five-point Likert scale of 1 (strongly dis-
agree) to 5 (strongly agree, SA). Any statement scoring
1–3 on the Likert scale could have suggestions made
with the intention to rephrase recommendations if
specific objections were raised during the first round.
Only those recommendations achieving 80% consensus
at level 5 (SA) and level 4 (agree, A), after two rounds
of voting have been included in the final guidelines.
ACPGBI members were obliged to vote on all consen-
sus statements. All other participants were given the
right to abstain on any guideline if they wished. Patient
representatives were specifically invited to comment on
any issues of which they had knowledge or experience.
The consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist represen-
tative only voted on Sections 16 and 17.
The level of evidence and grading for each recom-
mendation [5] are listed in Tables 1 and 2.
These guidelines represent ongoing work from the
period October 2016 to March 2018. We hope that
they will provide an updated and evidence-based sum-
mary of the current surgical knowledge in the manage-
ment of IBD and will serve as a useful practical
summary for clinicians practising in this area.
General principles in IBD surgery
Both ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease are charac-
terized by chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal
system in individuals with a genetic predisposition

 who have been exposed to risk factors in their environ-
ment, possibly linked to industrialization [6]. The most
recent systematic review studied the worldwide incidence
and prevalence of IBD, collating data from 147 studies
[7]. The incidence and prevalence of IBD is highest in
North America and Europe, with the highest prevalence
of ulcerative colitis in Norway (505 per 100 000 popula-
tion) and the USA (286 per 100 000) and of Crohn’s
disease in Germany (322 per 100 000) and Canada (319
per 100 000) [7]. Although most recent studies concur
that the incidence and prevalence of IBD has stabilized in
most Western populations, there is a steady overall
increase globally [7–9]. Incidence has been rising particu-
larly in the newly industrialized countries of Africa, Asia,
Oceania and South America, with a global prevalence
now surpassing 0.3%, which represents a significant
health burden [7].
Multidisciplinary management of patients with IBD
A multidisciplinary approach is essential to achieving
good outcomes for patients with IBD [10,11]. The
multidisciplinary team should function well in all set-
tings where IBD patients have contact: community,
outpatient clinics and ward-based care in elective and
emergency circumstances. Definition of the IBD multi-
disciplinary team is comprehensively covered in the IBD
Standards [12] and National Institute of Health and
Care Excellence (NICE) Quality Standard 81 [13]. The
same NICE Quality Standard also recommends that
‘People having surgery for inflammatory bowel disease
have it undertaken by a colorectal surgeon who is a core
member of the inflammatory bowel disease multidisci-
plinary team’ [13]. Integration of specialist nurses for
counselling, support and clinical expertise is essential
[14,15]. The multidisciplinary team should ideally be
sufficiently flexible to accommodate the needs of indi-
vidual patients and may be extended as required. There
is increasing recognition among healthcare professionals
that psychological distress [16–18], fatigue [19] and
pain [20] must be addressed alongside physical symp-
toms in patients with IBD.
Statement 1.1
Patients with IBD should be managed in a coordi-
nated fashion within a multidisciplinary team including
IBD gastroenterology, colorectal surgery, specialist
nursing, stoma therapy, gastrointestinal and interven-
tional radiology, pathology, nutrition support and
other specialities according to their individual needs.
Level of evidence: IV
Grade of recommendation: GP
Consensus: 97.1% (SA 85.7%, A 11.4%)
Ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease are both charac-
terized by relapsing and remitting symptoms, affecting
patients in different ways at different stages of the disease
and with variation in severity. Management involves
combinations of medical and surgical treatments, each
with their own risk–benefit profile. It is therefore impera-
tive that the wishes of individual patients are incorpo-
rated in decisions about their care, preferably in the
presence of a multidisciplinary team [21–23]. Communi-
cation among members of this multidisciplinary team is
essential to ensure timeliness of escalation in medication,
admission when required and management of surgical
complications [10]. Self-monitoring by patients shows
considerable promise, particularly when coupled with
central monitoring of changes in their disease state [24].

The chronicity of IBD means that patients may
require multiple endoscopic and radiological investiga-
tions. Where possible, imaging modalities that do not
involve ionizing radiation should be used: ultrasonogra-
phy and especially magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
offer high diagnostic accuracy [25]. Computed tomog-
raphy (CT) is increasingly used to inform and direct
management, especially in the emergency setting [26].
A recent meta-analysis concluded that 11% of patients
with Crohn’s disease and 2% of patients with ulcerative
colitis received potentially harmful levels of radiation
exposure, with patients requiring surgery being at par-
ticularly high risk [27]. Modern CT techniques to mini-
mize radiation dose should ideally be employed when
CT is required in IBD patients [28]. Where young
patients may need multiple investigations over time,
particularly with CT, the use of radiation diaries is
advisable to minimize radiation exposure and associated
radiation-induced cancer risk [25].
Statement 1.4
Radiation-free imaging techniques are preferable when
investigating patients with IBD. Judicious use of com-
puted tomography (CT) may be necessary to guide
management, particularly in emergency situations.

Grade of recommendation: A
Consensus 97.0% (SA 2.4%, A 54.5%)
Surgeons should also be aware that surgical interven-
tion may interrupt the normal arrangements for follow-
up of patients with IBD. Given the ongoing requirement
for gastroenterological input in the care for the majority
of IBD patients, in order to ensure appropriate medical
prophylaxis and stratification of patients to identify those
at highest risk of recurrence [29], allow multimodal
decision-making [30] and minimize the impact of ongo-
ing problems after surgery [31], it is deemed best prac-
tice to ensure adequate gastroenterological follow-up or
involvement after surgical intervention.
Statement 1.5
In addition to postoperative surgical review, follow-
up with a gastroenterologist or gastroenterology
advice should be arranged for all patients after IBD
surgery where required.

Relationship between volume and outcomes in IBD
surgery
Inflammatory Bowel Disease is relatively uncommon in
the general population and many clinicians may have
relatively little experience of managing patients with
IBD. It is therefore perhaps not surprising to find that
there
is
a
volume–outcome
relationship
in
several
aspects of managing patients with IBD, and that there
is a trend towards concentrating management of IBD
patients in higher-volume centres [32].
Volume becomes especially important when the risks
of surgical intervention for IBD are considered. High-
volume centres have lower mortality rates after colec-
tomy for acute severe colitis [33] and primary ileocaecal
resection in Crohn’s disease [34]. Similar associations
for mortality after emergency IBD surgery have also
been demonstrated in other healthcare systems [35].
In elective pouch surgery, lower-volume units tend
to have a longer length of stay and higher pouch failure
rates [36]. Managing complications proactively requires
experience, but this is difficult to accumulate at either
individual surgeon or institutional level, given the extre-
mely low volumes of pouch procedures carried out at
the majority of institutions in the UK [37,38]. There is
also significant variation among centres in other out-
comes after pouch surgery, including rates of laparo-
scopic approach, undiverted pouch surgery, reoperation
and readmission [38,39]. Overall, high-volume centres
are also more likely to offer a variety of restorative
options in well-selected patients [40].

ence in centralized stroke and cancer services suggest

 that the disadvantage of travelling further was out-
weighed
by
the
opportunity
to
receive
best
care
[41,42]. In cancer care, patients were willing to travel
75 min longer to reduce their risk of complications by
1% and over 5 h longer to reduce their risk of mortality
by 1%. [42]. The same principle will undoubtedly be
true for IBD patients accessing IBD services.
While some low-volume centres may undoubtedly
offer high-quality care, this is normally dependent on a
few individuals with expertise. More commonly, high-
volume centres tend to concentrate institutional experi-
ence of not just the surgical procedure but also knowl-
edge
of
when
and
how
to
manage
postoperative
complications or long-term functional problems [43].
Just making the correct diagnosis may improve patient
outcomes; the ability to differentiate between peri-
pouch sepsis and pouchitis is one such example [44].
Statement 1.6
Patients undergoing surgery for IBD tend to have
better outcomes in high-volume centres. In the
absence of local expertise, patients requiring either
elective or urgent surgery should be referred to a
specialist unit.
Level of evidence: IV
Grade of recommendation: GP
Consensus 94.3% (SA 57.1%, A 37.1%)
The
volume–outcome
relationship
becomes
even
more important when dealing with rare manifestations or
uncommon complex procedures. Patients with complica-
tions of IBD surgery including anastomotic leak, entero-
cutaneous fistula, chronic pelvic sepsis and pouch–vaginal
fistula are likely to achieve better outcomes if they are
referred to a specialist centre with sufficient experience
and expertise in managing complications [45] and mini-
mizing impact on patients’ quality of life. Most IBD clini-
cians will have limited experience of patients who are
adolescents [46], require revision surgery [47] or are
considering complex procedures such as continent ileost-
omy [48] or surgical repair of Crohn’s rectovaginal fistula
[49]. In these circumstances, the treating clinician should
ideally consider onward referral to a centre with subspe-
cialist expertise in the required area.
Statement 1.7
Consideration of referral to a unit with specialist
expertise should be considered for IBD patients with
complex or recurrent disease, including revision and
excision pouch surgery, rectovaginal fistula, Kock
pouch and in adolescence.

Consensus: 94.3% (SA 91.4%, A 2.9%)
Optimization of the IBD patient and timing of surgery
Timing of surgery for IBD patients is crucial in emer-
gency and elective situations. A patient admitted with
acute severe colitis may avoid colectomy due to increas-
ing advances in medical therapy [50], but may also face
increased risk of morbidity and mortality due to poorly
judged delays in proceeding to colectomy when failing
to respond with poor prognostic factors [35,51]. A par-
ticular case for early referral for consideration for colec-
tomy may be made in the frail patient with multiple
comorbidities who, while not necessarily a good candi-
date for surgery, nevertheless still has much less reserve
to
withstand
further
deterioration
after
prolonged
attempts at medical salvage [52,53].
Optimizing the IBD patient for elective surgery
requires resolution of sepsis after radiological interven-
tion
and
antibiotic
therapy,
reversal
of
nutritional
depletion and reducing or eliminating immunosup-
pressant (especially steroid) use while maintaining dis-
ease quiescence. Surgery should then be timed to
coincide with the small window of opportunity when
these ideals are met, and certainly prior to further
deterioration from loss of disease control [54]. Mul-
tidisciplinary management of patients with fistulating
perianal Crohn’s disease poses particular challenges, as
optimal therapy involves integration of surgical drai-
nage of abscesses with seton insertion followed by ini-
tiation and then optimization of biological therapy,
which in turn are followed by attempts at fistula heal-
ing in selected patients [55,56]. The median time
from presentation of symptoms to initiation of biolog-
ical
therapy
is
currently
around
7 months
in
UK
teaching hospitals, with a quarter of patients waiting
over 18 months for biological therapy even when the
diagnosis of Crohn’s disease is established [57]. Cen-
tralization of services may allow for the creation of
more
efficient
integrated
care
pathways
for
such
patients.
Inflammatory Bowel Disease surgeons may well have
to act as strong patient advocates to ensure timely
access to surgery for urgent or elective patients within a
National Health Service policy which stipulates that
over 92% of patients should receive treatment within
18 weeks of listing [58], a target that appears increas-
ingly unattainable [59]. The problem of undue waiting
times is not unique to the UK according to recent data

Risk of venous thromboembolism in patients requiring
surgery for IBD
Venous thromboembolism is a well-recognized compli-
cation in patients with active IBD [61], with such
patients having around a 2.85 times excess risk of
thromboembolic
events
[62].
Venous
thromboem-
bolism remains a significant cause of excess mortality in
patients with IBD [63]; this is of particular importance
when coupled with the additional excess risk associated
with surgical intervention.
In a retrospective study of just under 9000 patients
who had undergone abdominal and pelvic surgery for
IBD, the 30-day postoperative venous thromboembolic
rate was 2.7%, giving an odds ratio (OR) of 1.26 (95%
CI: 1.021–1.56) compared with 37 000 patients under-
going cancer surgery [64]. The strongest predictors of
thromboembolic complications after surgery for IBD
were stoma formation, with an adjusted OR of 1.95
(95% CI: 1.34–2.84), preoperative steroid administra-
tion [adjusted OR 1.57 (95% CI: 1.19–2.08)], ileoanal
pouch formation [adjusted OR 2.66 (95% CI: 1.65–
4.29)] and longer length of stay [adjusted OR 1.89
(95% CI: 1.41–2.52)] [65].
In a large population-based study examining venous
thromboembolism after colectomy for a variety of indi-
cations, and including 9850 patients with IBD, the 30-
day incidence of venous thromboembolism was 3.1% in
IBD patients. The 30-day incidence of venous throm-
boembolism was noted to be higher in patients with
ulcerative colitis than in patients with Crohn’s disease
(4.1% vs 2.1%, P < 0.001). Importantly, the cumulative
incidence of venous thromboembolism increased from
1.3% at 7 days to 4.3% at 90 days after surgery in
patients with IBD [66].
Rates of postoperative venous thromboembolism are
consistently around 2.5–3.5% across the IBD surgical lit-
erature and are a major reason for readmission after IBD
surgery [67], but extended chemoprophylaxis remains
the exception rather than the norm, with < 1% of postop-
erative IBD patients receiving extended prophylaxis in
one recent retrospective population-based study [65].
This is perhaps surprising given that over 40% of postop-
erative thromboembolic events following colectomy for
ulcerative colitis occur in patients after discharge from
hospital [68]. Patients undergoing resection for ulcera-
tive colitis are at highest risk of venous thromboembolism
if they require emergency surgery and are at high or mod-
erate risk of venous thromboembolism when undergoing
elective surgery, are on steroids or have hypoalbu-
minaemia [69]. While these are observational data, they
are also typical of many patients who require colectomy.
Several authors have noted the high rates of postop-
erative venous thromboembolism in IBD patients and
have suggested the extended use of venous thromboem-
bolism prophylaxis [64–66,69] along the same lines as
in current standard practice for patients undergoing col-
orectal cancer resection.
Statement 1.10
Venous thromboembolic prophylaxis should be opti-
mized in all patients requiring abdominal surgery for
IBD. Extended prophylaxis with 28 days of low-
molecular-weight heparin may be advisable.

 Ileoanal Pouch Registry, although there are undoubt-
edly limitations to voluntary data submission, inherent
selection bias, poor reporting of complications and lack
of long-term functional outcomes [70]. The ACPGBI
has also commissioned a web-based pouch surgery
reporting platform available to consultant members to
allow comparisons of volume and outcomes in pouch
surgery in England based on near real-time administra-
tive data sets [37,38] with plans to expand to surgical
procedures for Crohn’s disease.
Audit of surgical outcomes in IBD is particularly
important within the context of multimodal treatment,
especially where outcomes from medical treatments may
also be associated with significant complications, and
both medical and surgical options will need to be con-
sidered by the multidisciplinary team [71,72]. Ideally,
surgical outcomes should be embedded in combined
national databases; the UK IBD Audit was responsible
for auditing all outcomes for IBD patients from 2006
until 2016 [73] and its function has now been taken
over by the IBD Registry, a joint venture between
Crohn’s and Colitis UK, the Royal College of Physi-
cians and the British Society of Gastroenterology, with
representation from the ACPGBI.
Snapshot audits also have their role in answering speci-
fic questions: the European Society of Coloproctology
(ESCP) snapshot audit in right hemicolectomy included
a significant subset of patients with IBD [74]. A further
combined snapshot audit of patients with colitis will be
the next combined project between ESCP and the Euro-
pean Crohn’s and Colitis Organisation (ECCO).
Good audit allows measurement of agreed key per-
formance indicators to monitor outcomes, reduce varia-
tion, drive up standards across IBD services [75] and
give opportunities to implement quality improvement
initiatives [76]. Reporting of patient-reported outcomes
[77] and especially patient submission of their own out-
comes are key areas for future development [78]. The
ideal scenario would be composite databases with dual
data entry interfaces for both clinician and individual
patient to contribute.
Statement 1.11
Standard of care for IBD patients undergoing sur-
gery should include registration in prospectively
managed and adequately resourced national data-
bases with inclusion of short- and long-term out-
come data to allow comparative audit of agreed key
performance indicators.

Research in IBD surgery
The James Lind Alliance conducted a priority-setting
partnership for key topics in IBD research [79] and, in
similar fashion, the ACPGBI published its own consen-
sus-driven prioritization of research topics in colorectal
surgery [80]. Both prioritize research to optimize out-
comes for patients with perianal Crohn’s disease and to
assess the role and timing of surgical resection as an
alternative to medical therapy in ileocaecal Crohn’s dis-
ease. Both subjects have been the subject of recent
commissioned
calls
from
the
National
Institute

Assessment,
although there are no nationally funded studies yet.
The ECCO ran a workshop in unmet research needs
in perianal Crohn’s disease and identified the natural
history of perianal Crohn’s disease, classification of fis-
tula tracks, clinical, patient-reported and MRI outcome
measures and lack of randomized controlled trials as
major research gaps [81]. The latter concern is partly
met by the ongoing PISA trial in fistulating perianal
Crohn’s disease that offers randomization among three
arms of (i) standard care with long-term seton place-
ment and oral immunosuppression, (ii) biological ther-
apy with timed seton removal and (iii) seton drainage
with limited biological therapy and then advancement
flap [82]. A recent randomized trial has been published
examining
stem
cell
therapy
in
fistulizing
perianal
Crohn’s disease, with some promise from a novel inter-
vention [83].
There is continued enthusiasm among clinicians and
patients for simple surgical solutions that may carry
minimal risk while still offering remission from IBD.
With the publication of a systematic review suggesting
that appendicectomy alters the activity of colitis in
patients with acute ulcerative colitis [84], a multicentre
study is now under way to assess the safety and efficacy
of appendicectomy in ulcerative colitis [85].
With recognized variation in national trends at recon-
structive surgery after colectomy with either pouch sur-
gery or ileoanal anastomosis, research is now in progress
to examine the relative merits of both options [86].
Technical aspects of surgery continue to evolve, with
studies to examine transanal resection to assist rectal dis-
section [87], anastomotic techniques aimed at minimiz-
ing anastomotic leak [88], new methods of undertaking
ileocaecal anastomosis to reduce recurrence rates [89]
and innovative ways to prevent the formation of paras-
tomal hernia [90]. Reducing recognized consequences of
surgery that affect quality of life, such as pouchitis, is a
key research area, with faecal microbial transplantation
currently under evaluation as a potential intervention for
pouchitis [91].

Small bowel surgery in Crohn’s disease
The small bowel, and especially the terminal ileum, is
commonly affected in about 80% of Crohn’s cases with
one-third of patients having isolated ileitis. Crohn’s dis-
ease is a complex disorder with no surgical cure and the
primary treatment is medical. However, about half of
patients will need surgery within 5 years of diagnosis, ris-
ing to 70% after 15 years of onset of the disease [95]. The
aim of surgery is to improve quality of life in situations
where medical management is less effective. To achieve
this aim, the decision to recommend surgery should be
made through close interdisciplinary discussion between
gastroenterologists and surgeons, and in consultation
with the patient and his/her wishes. If surgery is indi-
cated, the underlying principle has to be bowel sparing
[96]. Unfortunately, there are few high-quality random-
ized controlled trials to assess different surgical techniques
for surgery in small bowel Crohn’s disease and much of
the evidence is from small studies and historic data [97].
Indications for surgery
Failure of medical treatment
Crohn’s disease is a lifelong chronic inflammatory dis-
ease which is mainly treated medically. Biological thera-
pies, including anti-tumour necrosis factor a (TNFa)
agents, are very effective in treating cases that are refrac-
tory to first-line agents [e.g. glucocorticoids, 5-aminosa-
licylates (5-ASAs), antibiotics] [98]. The failure of
medical treatment can be either primary nonresponsive
or secondary (subsequent loss of response). The primary
response is usually evaluated after 8–12 weeks from the
start of treatment [99]. Surgery is recommended for
such patients and for those who are noncompliant with
medical treatment or develop severe complications from
its continuation [100,101].
Statement 2.1.
Surgery is recommended in patients with localized
small bowel disease who experience failure, noncom-
pliance with or complications of medical treatment.

Growth retardation
Growth failure is the most common extraintestinal mani-
festation in children and adolescents with Crohn’s disease
(see Section 15). It can be attributed to a variety of factors
including the inflammatory process itself, malnutrition,
hypogonadism and treatment with glucocorticoids. The
management includes nutritional support, immunomodu-
lators and surgery [102]. Catch-up growth is usually man-
ifested in children within 6 months after surgery [103].
Thus, surgery is an attractive option for treatment of chil-
dren with localized disease after failure of noninvasive
methods that enables relief from acute complications,
maintaining remission and nutritional recovery [104].

disease despite medical treatment

Consensus: 90.9% (SA 51.5%, A 39.4%)
Ileojejunal stricture
The behaviour of Crohn’s disease may be nonstrictur-
ing, nonpenetrating (B1), stricturing (B2) or penetrat-
ing (B3) [105]. About one-third of patients with
Crohn’s disease will develop stricturing disease. Stric-
tures may be single or multiple, short or long and may
occur anywhere in the gastrointestinal track. The most
common sites are the small bowel, especially terminal
ileum, and at surgical anastomoses.
Assessment will generally require ileo-colonoscopy
and cross-sectional imaging by CT or MR enterogra-
phy, or transabdominal ultrasound. CT or MR enterog-
raphy are considered the gold standard techniques for
assessment of small bowel disease. Both techniques, in
addition to inflammatory markers, are useful in distin-
guishing inflammatory from fibrostenotic disease which
is important as inflammatory strictures are more likely
to respond to medical therapy whereas fibrotic disease is
likely to require mechanical treatment [106,107].

 The decision to recommend surgery is ultimately a
balance between potential benefits (relief of symptoms,
improved nutrition and possible reduction of medica-
tions) and the morbidity of surgery (i.e. anastomotic
leakage, stoma, altered symptoms, changed body image,
later recurrence and short bowel syndrome). The surgi-
cal options include endoscopic balloon dilatation, stric-
tureplasty and resection.
Endoscopic balloon dilatation
Endoscopic balloon dilatation has become increasingly
popular for the treatment of selected symptomatic
Crohn’s strictures which are short, not associated with
markers of inflammation or fistulas and within the
reach of a standard colonoscope [108]. Thienpont
et al. reported their experience of 237 dilatations in
138 patients. All strictures treated were < 5 cm and
were predominantly at ileocolic anastomoses (see Sec-
tion 3). Immediate success, judged by the ability to
pass an adult colonoscope through the stricture, was
achieved in 97%. Six perforations occurred (2.5% risk
per procedure, 4.3% risk per patient). At median fol-
low-up of 5 years, 24% of patients required surgery
and 46% repeat dilatation. After the first dilation, 44%
of
patients
remained
dilatation-
and
surgery-free
[109]. The incidence of complications was low, reach-
ing 2%, with perforation being the most common
[110].
Also,
a
long-term
prospective
study
of
55
patients found that balloon dilatation helped to avoid
surgery in 70% of patients. Some researchers sug-
gested that the presence of ulcers, stricture site and
length are the determinants of the success of the pro-
cedure. However, a systematic review of 353 strictures
stated that the only predictor of a surgery-free out-
come was a short stricture [111]. The same findings
were supported by another review that included 3252
strictures in 1500 patients; those authors noted that
steroid
injection
and
increased
length
of
stricture
made
earlier
surgical
re-intervention
more
likely
[112].
Statement 2.3
Endoscopic balloon dilatation is a therapeutic option
for small bowel Crohn’s and anastomotic strictures
of < 5 cm that are endoscopically accessible with no
associated abscess or fistula, provided immediate sur-
gical support is available.

Grade of recommendation: B
Consensus: 96.9% (SA 40.6%, A 56.3%)
Strictureplasty
Strictureplasty, like endoscopic balloon dilatation, is an
alternative to resection which fits with the principle of
bowel preservation. A systematic review assessed 1112
patients who underwent 3259 strictureplasties, 94% of
them being in the jejunum and/or ileum. The 5-year sur-
gical recurrence rate was 28%. Recurrence occurred at
nonstrictureplasty sites in 90% of patients with site-speci-
fic recurrence rate detected in only 3%. Strictureplasty
was therefore very safe and effective in the treatment of
short recurrent strictures [113]. Another review con-
cluded that a lower postoperative complication rate was
observed with strictureplasty compared with resection.
However, the results were not statistically significant
(P = 0.09). In addition, significantly longer recurrence-
free survival was noted in the resection arm [114].
Contraindications to strictureplasty include bowel
wall
phlegmon,
carcinoma
or
active
bleeding
with
mucosal ulceration [115]. The most common clinical
dilemma is whether to resect a segment of multiple
strictures that are close together or to undertake one or
more strictureplasties. Although the principle of bowel
preservation is well established, in practice resection is
much more common than strictureplasty. If the stric-
ture(s) is limited to a short segment of small bowel and
the remainder of the bowel is normal and not short
(over 200 cm), then limited resection is favoured. Stric-
tureplasty should be considered when multiple strictures
are present, when stricture(s) are associated with diffuse
involvement of the small bowel, when < 200 cm of nor-
mal bowel remains or if disease has recurred rapidly
after previous resection.
Statement 2.4
Strictureplasty should be considered as the surgical
technique of choice when multiple strictures are pre-
sent and there is concern about preservation of
bowel length.

Resection
Resection is the most commonly performed type of
surgery for small bowel disease. It is considered as an
early treatment for localized ileal disease after taking
into consideration the risks and benefits of both medi-
cal and surgical treatment, the risk of recurrence after
surgery and patient choice [116]. Surgery is likely to

 be more successful than medical therapy if there is
fibrotic disease with a minimal inflammatory compo-
nent. This is particularly the case if there are obstruc-
tive symptoms.
The reoperation rate in this selected group is high,
reaching 50% after many years. However, there are no
available comparative data about the long-term rates
after medical therapy. Also, there are no studies to eval-
uate the quality of life after both lines of treatment
[115]. Therefore, resection is still considered to be a
reasonable option for treatment of symptomatic local-
ized disease, either from diagnosis or after failure of
medical treatment.
Statement 2.5
Early resection is the preferred surgical option for
localized small bowel Crohn’s disease where there
are obstructive symptoms due to mainly fibrotic dis-
ease not amenable to endoscopic balloon dilatation.

Consensus: 96.9% (SA 71.9%, A 25.0%)
Abscess
Smaller abscesses < 4 cm can be treated by parenteral
antibiotics while larger ones usually require image-guided
drainage as recommended by the American College of
Radiology [116,117]. Percutaneous drainage has gained
popularity over the last few years; according to a nation-
wide report usage in the USA has risen from 7% 20 years
ago to 29% [118]. Current evidence would suggest that,
in the presence of an abscess, surgery should be avoided
as first-line treatment to avoid unnecessary bowel resec-
tion [119]. If surgery is indicated due to concomitant fis-
tula or stricture, delaying intervention until percutaneous
drainage has been carried out and the patient optimized
from a nutritional and inflammatory perspective will lead
to reduced overall length of bowel resection, incidence of
complications and likelihood of stoma formation [119–
121] (see Section 3).
Perforation
The
incidence
of
free
perforation
in
small
bowel
Crohn’s disease varies from 1 to 16% [122–124]. It is
usually an indication for immediate surgery due to asso-
ciated peritonitis. Bowel resection with stoma formation
is the preferred intervention. However, primary anasto-
mosis can be an option for haemodynamically stable
patients with good general condition and localized con-
tamination [101].

Fistula
Primary management of fistula includes delineation of
its anatomy, drainage of sepsis, nutritional support and
determining the underlying cause, whether inflamma-
tion or stenosis. For primary enterocutaneous fistula,
resectional
surgery
is
generally
necessary,
although
medical treatment may be attempted [125,126]. The
evidence for medical therapy is minimal and of low
quality. Entero-enteric fistulas are usually asymptomatic
and require surgery only if they cause malabsorption
or diarrhoea [2]. For entero-urogenital fistula, surgery
is still superior to medical therapy, but again medial
therapy may be attempted [127,128] (see Sections 3
and 12).

Intestinal neoplasia
The risk for small bowel adenocarcinoma in Crohn’s
disease is low, being approximately 2.2% at 25 years
[129]. However, there is a paucity of clinical research in
this area. Risk factors include duration of the disease,
young age at diagnosis, male gender, site
of the
Crohn’s, inflammation and strictures [130]. Any suspi-
cious lesion identified by imaging or during stricture-
plasty or endoscopic examination should be biopsied. If
that is not possible, surgical resection is required to rule
out malignancy [101].

 Surgical technique
The surgical approach
Laparoscopy has advantages over open surgery in terms
of quicker recovery, less pain, early mobilization, lower
incidence of adhesions, incisional hernia and wound
infection, in addition to better cosmesis and body
image. A Cochrane Review and two randomized con-
trolled trials (RCTs) with long follow up reaching
10 years provide the evidence [131–133]. Minimally
invasive surgery has been employed successfully in com-
plex cases associated with fistula, previous surgery or
abscess, with morbidity and hospital stay equivalent to
those
of
initial
resection
or
uncomplicated
disease
[134–136] (see Sections 3 and 12).

Laparoscopy is the preferred surgical approach for
small bowel Crohn’s disease, particularly for primary

Resection margins
In Crohn’s disease, the involved bowel can be differenti-
ated from the normal one by palpating the mesenteric bor-
der of the bowel wall, where it is usually thickened with fat
wrapped on the sides of the wall [99]. Some older studies
were in favour of extended resection for the involved
bowel [137,138]. However, a RCT of 152 patients com-
paring a macroscopically limited resection margin of 2 cm
with an extended resection margin of 12 cm, found that
the width of the excised margin did not affect recurrence.
More significantly, recurrence rates did not increase with
the presence of microscopic disease at the specimen’s mar-
gins [139]. There is, however, some emerging evidence
that the extent of mesenteric resection, rather than bowel
length, may have an impact on disease recurrence [140].
For further discussion see Section 3.

Type of anastomosis
An
intriguing
aspect
of
postoperative
recurrent
Crohn’s disease is that in about 90% of cases recur-
rence occurs just proximal to the anastomosis. The
significance of the technique of anastomosis in this
pattern of recurrence is uncertain. Anastomoses may
be constructed in a variety of configurations (end-
to-end,
end-to-side,
side-to-end
and
side-to-side)
using either stapled devices (linear or circular) or
sutures (one or two layers and various materials). A
variety of trials and one meta-analysis have addressed
the
significance
of
the
anastomotic
technique
in
terms of leakage rates and subsequent recurrence
[141–145]. All reports have tended to focus on ileo-
colic
anastomosis
and
are
therefore
discussed
in
more detail in Section 3. It is impossible to analyse
the data for small bowel anastomoses alone. How-
ever,
if
the
results
for
ileocolic
anastomosis
are
extrapolated to small bowel anastomoses alone there
is no evidence to suggest that one type of anasto-
mosis is better than another.
Statement 2.11.
There is insufficient evidence to suggest an associa-
tion between anastomotic technique and incidence
of recurrent Crohn’s disease after small bowel resec-
tion. Small bowel anastomosis may be carried out
according to surgeon preference.

Ileocaecal resection in Crohn’s disease
Crohn’s disease is a severe inflammatory condition of
the intestine affecting 322 per 100 000 people in Eur-
ope and 319 per 100 000 people in North America [9].
It is associated with periods of debilitating symptoms
including
tiredness,
severe
abdominal
discomfort,
weight loss and chronic diarrhoea, often leading to the
need for hospitalization and time off work. The disease
can affect any part of the gastrointestinal track from the
mouth to the anus, but in one-third of patients it is
localized to the ileocaecal region. The IBD surgeon is
frequently involved in managing patients with ileocaecal
Crohn’s disease as medical therapy is currently ineffec-
tive in controlling disease for a significant proportion of
patients and the ileocaecal segment is readily amenable
to surgical resection. This section discusses the impor-
tant aspects of surgery for ileocaecal Crohn’s disease.
Indications for surgery
Patients presenting for the first time with localized ileo-
caecal Crohn’s will usually be treated with systemic ster-
oids to induce remission [153]. Subsequent therapy
may be medical or surgical and will be influenced by
disease severity and also by patient choice. Mild disease
may be best treated with budesonide. Severe disease,
especially where complications are present at presenta-
tion, may be best treated with surgery. Moderately
active disease is the area where there is limited evidence
to guide best practice. The European Crohn’s and Coli-
tis guidelines note a consensus preference for avoiding
early surgery in moderately active ileocaecal disease but
also acknowledge the lack of evidence in making this
recommendation [153]. Research to resolve this issue
remains a major priority [79,94].
Statement 3.1
Ileocaecal Crohn’s resection should be considered in
patients with fibrotic disease, with symptomatic fis-
tulizing
disease,
with
asymptomatic
fistulizing
disease where mucosal healing is not achieved, and
after drainage of Crohn’s-related abscess.
Level of evidence: IV
Grade of recommendation: GP
Consensus: 96.8% (SA 64.5%, A 32.3%)
Timing of surgery
There is a tendency for both patient and physician
alike to perceive prolonged medical therapy as the
treatment of choice with surgery reserved for failure of
medical treatment, but this dogma is questionable
given the high rates of resection observed in patients
with ileocaecal Crohn’s disease [154]. As Crohn’s is a
lifelong
condition,
medical
therapy
is
usually
pro-
tracted. The length of treatment for immunomodula-
tory therapy (e.g. anti-TNFa) in particular is unknown
and open ended. Morbidity is not insignificant, and
there are high costs associated with prolonged treat-
ment.
Most
patients
will
eventually
need
surgery
[155]. The recently reported LIR!C trial suggests that,
even with immunomodulatory therapy, 37% of patients
with terminal ileal Crohn’s will have surgery within
4 years of initiating treatment [71]. Studies on the
effect of long-term medical therapy on quality of life
are lacking. In contrast there is evidence that surgery
will reduce the need for further surgery in the long
term in at least 50% of patients [156–158]. Indeed a
survey of patients who had ileocaecal resection after
medical therapy suggested that over 75% wished they
had undergone surgery earlier [159]. There is there-
fore an argument for earlier surgical intervention. The
argument is perhaps strongest for those with obstruc-
tive
symptoms
and
minimal
inflammatory
activity
[160–162]. In this situation, fibrotic stenosis is likely
to be prominent and medical therapy probably ineffec-
tive. It is possible that, even with an inflammatory
component to the disease process, early surgery may
result in a better quality of life for patients than
immunomodulatory therapy. High-quality evidence is
lacking and randomized trials are proposed to investi-
gate this specific hypothesis. There is some corrobora-
tive evidence to suggest that patients undergoing early
surgery achieve better resolution of the inflammatory
response [163].
For those with recurrent disease after initial immuno-
suppressive medical therapy (steroids and/or azathio-
prine) there are good-quality RCT data [71]. LIR!C
suggests that quality of life and hospital admission
12 months after medical therapy with infliximab or
laparoscopic surgical resection is the same. In addition,

 important considerations for patients such as body
image and cosmesis do not seem to be negatively
affected by surgery. Laparoscopic resection for limited
nonstricturing ileocaecal Crohn’s disease in patients for
whom conventional therapy has failed could be consid-
ered as a reasonable alternative to infliximab [71].

A further clinical scenario is the ‘surprise diagnosis’
made at laparotomy in the acutely ill patient. This should
be a rare event with the increasing use of preoperative
imaging and laparoscopy. However, if a patient is found
to have unexpected localized ileitis, resection is not usu-
ally advocated as it can be virtually impossible to differ-
entiate Crohn’s disease from other causes of enteritis.
Interestingly, when asked what they would recommend
if faced with this scenario, most surgeons would not do
any resection and refer for medical therapy. Conversely
most physicians would advocate surgery [164].

Surgical approach
Open versus laparoscopic surgery
The evidence for a laparoscopic approach compared with
open surgery for initial ileocaecal Crohn’s is strong
[133,165,166].
Proven
advantages
include
better
cosmesis, earlier recovery, shorter length of stay and a
reduction in both early morbidity, later incisional hernia
and adhesion problems. Despite this, nearly 60% of pro-
cedures in the UK are carried out via an open approach
[167]. The reason for this high rate of open surgery is
unclear but may relate at least in part to complex disease
or recurrent surgery where the benefit of laparoscopy is
not proven. Certainly, laparoscopy is possible and safe in
experienced hands, but there must be a low threshold for
early conversion to avoid unnecessary iatrogenic compli-
cations [134,168] (see also Sections 2 and 12).
Single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS)
The use of a SILS approach for ileocaecal Crohn’s resec-
tion is unproven. Although there are advocates who
claim significantly reduced analgesia requirements with
other outcome measures comparable to multiport laparo-
scopic surgery [169–171], the data are retrospective and
open to marked selection bias, with the multiport laparo-
scopic group tending to have had more complex surgery.
The SILS procedure is undoubtedly surgically demand-
ing. There may be small advantages in terms of cosmesis

Extent of resection
The clinical focus for Crohn’s disease has long been on
the mucosal disease. Surgeons initially tried to reduce
the chance of recurrent mucosal disease by extended
surgical resection of all bowel with mucosal disease in
the belief that microscopic clearance was key. However,
extended surgical resection only predisposed patients

 with Crohn’s disease to short gut syndrome and so the
current vogue for conservative surgery was established.
Recently there has been increasing recognition that
Crohn’s disease affects not just the bowel lumen but
also its mesentery, and that unresected mesentery may
contribute to high recurrence rates [172–174]. Hence
the mesentery has been suggested as an additional tar-
get for resection by the IBD surgeon [175]. Current
surgical techniques advise conservation of the mesentery
with division close to the bowel wall. It is conceivable
that a more oncological-style mesocolic resection may
reduce need for surgery for recurrence. Evidence for
this hypothesis comes from a study showing that high
levels of visceral fat are predictive of recurrence [176].
A radical approach may not be easy; many patients have
thickened mesentery with friable vessels that can be dif-
ficult to ligate. More radical mesenteric resection may
also increase complications. While an initial cohort
study has suggested that extended mesenteric resection
may reduce recurrence rates [140], a formal trial com-
paring close vs radical mesenteric resection is required
prior to any change in the current advice for a conserva-
tive approach (see Section 2).
Anastomotic technique
The important outcomes regarding anastomotic tech-
nique are anastomotic leakage rate and rate of symp-
tomatic
recurrent
disease.
Recurrent
disease
after
surgery is unfortunately common, with an actuarial risk
of about 1.5% per year [177]. Surgeons have for many
years explored different anastomotic techniques in the
hope of reducing recurrence rates.
Stapled
side-to-side
versus
hand-sewn
end-to-end
anastomosis
There have been several trials and meta-analyses looking
at the two commonest methods of anastomosis: the sta-
pled side-to-side anastomosis and the hand-sewn end-
to-end technique. Advocates of the stapled side-to-side
anastomosis suggest that recurrence is lower, possibly
due to a wider lumen. Results are conflicting, but the
most recent meta-analyses concluded that stapled side-
to-side anastomosis is the preferred procedure, resulting
in reduced overall postoperative complications, espe-
cially anastomotic leakage, but also decreased recurrence
and reoperation rate [142,144,178]. These data should
be treated with caution. The meta-analyses include both
randomized and nonrandomized trials. If only data
from randomized trials are analysed, the difference dis-
appears. In addition, none of the trials allowed for con-
founding risk factors for recurrence and follow-up was
inadequate in the majority of trials included in analysis.
In light of these limitations, it would be unwise to
make a strong association between anastomotic tech-
nique and recurrence rates.
Side-to-side isoperistaltic strictureplasty
A bowel-sparing surgical strategy is essential when operat-
ing on patients with Crohn’s disease. About 40% of
patients will go on to have further surgery in their lifetime
due to recurrence. About 8% will ultimately develop
intestinal failure as a consequence of repeated extensive
resection [179,180]. The modified long Michelassi stric-
tureplasty is perhaps the ultimate bowel-sparing proce-
dure for terminal ileal Crohn’s disease [181]. With the
side-to-side isoperistaltic strictureplasty constructed over
the length of the ileocaecal valve, the whole bowel is pre-
served. Such a procedure has been proven to be feasible
and safe provided there is no phlegmon, abscess or fistula
originating from the treated segment [182]. Despite
macroscopic disease being present in the anastomosed
segment, significant mucosal healing has been observed
in many reports [183]. The mechanism of healing is
unclear but may relate to alleviation of faecal stasis once
mechanical obstruction is resolved. Long-term cancer risk
may be a concern, but rates appear to be extremely low
[184] and the surgical construction does allow for endo-
scopic surveillance. Certainly, such a technique is war-
ranted in the patient with extensive small bowel disease
that includes the terminal ileum.
Kono-S anastomosis
The Kono-S anastomosis has been advocated as a tech-
nique that may reduce surgical anastomotic recurrence.
The technique involves suturing the stapled ends of the
resected bowel to create a supporting column. A hand-
sewn anastomosis is then created on the anti-mesenteric
border of the bowel at least 1 cm from this supporting
column. Theoretically the supporting column maintains
the diameter of the anastomosis, preventing distortion
and stenosis. The wide anastomosis and anastomosis
away from the mesenteric border of the bowel all pur-
portedly contribute to a reduction in postoperative
recurrence. An international multicentre cohort study of
187 patients has demonstrated a remarkably low 10-
year surgical recurrence-free survival rate of 98.6% [89].
A prospective randomized study is ongoing to corrobo-
rate these early encouraging observations.
Statement 3.7.
There is insufficient evidence to suggest an associa-
tion between anastomotic technique in ileocaecal
resection and incidence of recurrence. Promising
alternative techniques require further assessment.

The role of endoscopic balloon dilatation
The ECCO consensus on management of Crohn’s dis-
ease recommends balloon dilatation for the manage-
ment of ileocaecal disease as an alternative after initial
medical treatment [2]. In clinical practice, this option is
determined by the characteristics of the stricture. Stric-
tures should be accessible, as is the case with most ileo-
caecal strictures, short and single site. Anastomotic
strictures are perhaps the most amenable to dilatation.
There are risks associated with the technique, including
inability to completely dilate, perforation and bleeding
in the short term, and recurrence in the long term
[110]. A recent meta-analysis suggests that therapeutic
response (for ileocaecal as well as more proximal small
bowel strictures) is as high as 70% with a 5–8% compli-
cation rate [185]. The authors point out that whilst this
response rate is appealing, endoscopic dilatation is
essentially a short-term solution, with 75% of patients
eventually undergoing surgery during 5-year follow-up.

Crohn’s-related abscess
Crohn’s disease results in transmural inflammation with
deep fissuring. In more than 20% of patients this can lead
to abscess formation [121]. Immediate surgery may be
carried out in this situation but surgery may be complex
and often results in stoma formation. There is an increas-
ing trend to manage this situation conservatively, initially
with percutaneous drainage and antibiotics [118]. This
forms part of a surgical strategy to optimize the patient
before later definitive surgery [186] (see later). In 30% of
patients there is complete resolution of the abscess
[121]. The dilemma in these patients is whether to
continue with planned surgery or to institute medical
therapy as an alternative. The evidence for which option
is best is poor. One retrospective case series of 13 patients
with a phlegmon treated with antibiotics and then medi-
cal therapy suggested that 90% avoided surgery for a
median of 2.3 years [187]. However, the risks of medical
therapy, particularly immunosuppressor or immunomod-
ulator treatment, in a patient with the potential for septic
sequelae must be high and careful observation would be
required. Further proposed trials (LIR!C 2, BIONIC)
may answer the question of whether to treat this group
surgically or medically. Until then, factors favouring early
resectional surgery include short segment disease, devel-
opment of an abscess while on biological therapy, persis-
tent symptoms after abscess drainage or inability to drain
an abscess percutaneously.

Enteric fistulas
Enteric fistulas connecting diseased segments of terminal
ileum or the ileocaecal area to other organs are common
and often asymptomatic. Surgical resection of Crohn’s
enteric fistulas is not indicated in asymptomatic patients
with an incidental radiological finding of enteroenteric
fistula [188]. However, surgery is indicated for persistent
symptoms, most notably of diarrhoea, abdominal pain
and weight loss, but also for associated stenotic or septic
complications or if mucosal healing of Crohn’s disease is
not achieved despite optimized medical therapy [2]. As
most fistulas in Crohn’s disease arise from a segment of

 diseased bowel, this is the principal target for resection
[189]. The recipient organ, for example small bowel, sig-
moid colon or bladder, is usually amenable to surgical
repair rather than requiring resection.

manifestation of ileocaecal Crohn’s disease, especially
after abscess drainage, but around a quarter arise as a
complication
of
anastomotic
failure
after
resection
[189]. Enterocutaneous fistulas require aggressive early
treatment with antibiotics, percutaneous drainage of
infection, correction of fluid and electrolyte distur-

Postoperative management
Many studies have looked at potential predictors of
recurrence of Crohn’s disease, which may be useful in
influencing not only the intensity of surveillance but
also the requirement for costly and potentially toxic
postoperative immunomodulating drugs or combination
therapies. Young age at time of index surgery, prior
intestinal surgery, penetrating disease, coexisting peri-
anal disease and, in particular, smoking are established
risk
factors
[2].
Severe
myenteric
plexitis
may
be
another predictor of recurrence [191,192].
The currently most effective diagnostic tool for
detecting
recurrence
is
ileocolonoscopy.
Endoscopic
recurrence precedes clinical recurrence, allowing for
escalation of medical therapy in the hope of reducing
the need for re-do surgery [193,194]. Various prophy-
lactic medical therapies have been evaluated over the
last 30 years and treatment should be considered in
patients who have at least one of the recognized risk
factors [2]. Further details of types of therapy and evi-
dence for their use are available in the updated BSG
guidance (in preparation). IBD surgeons should ensure
prompt follow-up with a gastroenterologist for patients
undergoing ileocaecal resection.

rence after ileocaecal resection, including positive

Colectomy for IBD
Despite the increased prevalence of IBD there is evi-
dence that the number of colectomies performed is
decreasing. Previous studies assessing the likelihood of
requiring colectomy in ulcerative colitis have reported
rates as high as 65% at 25 years [50]. However, many
of the data on the long-term risk of colectomy emerged
from cohorts who were diagnosed and followed up in
the 1970s and 1980s. A subsequent report based on a
study period from 1989–2009 reported a colectomy
rate for ulcerative colitis of 10% at 10 years [195].
Prospective population cohort studies from Scandinavia
for both ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s also report a
decrease in rate of colectomy [196]. In a systematic
review and meta-analysis the progressively decreased risk
of surgery for IBD was convincingly demonstrated for
both ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease. The risk of
surgery 1, 5 and 10 years after diagnosis of ulcerative
colitis was 4.9% (95% CI: 3.8–6.3%), 11.6% (95% CI:
9.3–14.4%) and 15.6% (95% CI: 12.5–19.6%), respec-
tively.
The decreased need for surgery is attributed in part
to the adoption of additional medical treatment in
patients with severe colitis who fail to respond to high-
dose steroids. This second-line intervention has been
termed rescue therapy, given the generalized sentiment
that surgery equates to failure in acute severe colitis.
The two effective options for treating steroid-refractory
acute severe ulcerative colitis are ciclosporin and inflix-
imab; both have been examined in RCTs and have
equal efficacy in the short and medium term. Colec-
tomy rates were 17% in the ciclosporin group and 21%
in the infliximab arm (CYSif) and 41% vs 47% (Con-
struct) [197,198]. However, long-term rates of surgery
after rescue therapy in acute severe colitis remain high,
with 43% of patients requiring colectomy by 12 months
in pooled randomized trials [199].
The management of patients with a flare of IBD or
ongoing resistance to medical therapy is increasingly
complex. Over the past two decades the significant
expansion in the number of treatment options available
for Crohn’s and ulcerative colitis, initially with mono-
clonal antibodies against anti-TNFa (infliximab, adali-
mumab,
certolizumab
pegol,
golimumab)
and
subsequently anti-integrin (natalizumab, vedolizumab)
therapies, in addition to increased understanding of com-
bined therapy with conventional immunosuppressive
drugs, has complicated the decision process as to when
and how to operate. This fact is highly relevant to the
IBD surgeon as colectomy with ileostomy is one of the
commonest procedures in IBD, accounting for 33% of
surgical procedures in the recent UK IBD audit [200].
Statement 4.1
Colectomy rates for inflammatory bowel disease are
decreasing due to improvements in medical rescue
therapies. Nevertheless more than a third of patients
requiring rescue therapy for acute severe colitis will
subsequently undergo colectomy within 12 months.

Indications for colectomy
Acute severe colitis
Acute severe colitis occurs in 12–25% of all patients with
ulcerative colitis and is the first manifestation of IBD in
20–30% of patients [201–203]. Acute severe colitis is
diagnosed according to Truelove and Witts’ criteria,
namely bloody stool frequency ≥ 6 per day and at least
one of the following: pulse rate > 90 b.p.m., temperature
> 37.8°C, haemoglobin < 10.5 g/dl and erythrocyte
sedimentation
rate
(ESR) > 30 mm/h
[204].
More
recently, the ECCO and the American College of Gas-
troenterology have modified the Truelove and Witts cri-
teria, defining acute severe colitis as that characterized by
more than six stools per day, accompanied by one of the
signs of systemic toxicity, namely tachycardia, fever, anae-
mia and elevated ESR [205].
Three modes of presentation are recognized in clinical
practice: (i) new-onset colitis, representing roughly one-
third of the acute severe colitis population; (ii) acute-on-
chronic colitis; and (iii) relapsing and remitting patterns
of disease. A quarter of all patients with ulcerative colitis
experience at least one episode of acute severe colitis;
20% come to colectomy on first admission, rising to 40%
after two admissions. The likelihood of colectomy is
related to biological severity on admission [201].
All patients with acute severe colitis should be admit-
ted to hospital with access to shared specialist care pro-
vided by a gastroenterologist and colorectal surgeon.

 Centralized care has been shown to improve outcomes
and reduce mortality [33] (see Section 1). Initial treat-
ment is implemented with high-dose intravenous ster-
oids in a dose of 100 mg of hydrocortisone four times
a day or as a continuous infusion of the equivalent dose
of methylprednisolone (60 mg). Although commonly
recommended, these doses are not based on dose-ran-
ging studies performed on this kind of patient but are
extrapolated from a single study in patients with mild
to moderate ulcerative colitis. Higher doses do not
improve the outcome [206].
Given that 60–69% of patients respond to steroids
there is a need to develop methods to predict those
who will fail to improve, with a view to instigating
either
rescue
therapy
or
colectomy
[207].
In
the
absence of a widely accepted management and monitor-
ing protocol, one of the major challenges faced by clini-
cians is the potential to continue medical therapy that is
unlikely to change the outcome but will increase the
risk of the subsequent surgery. Close monitoring of
patients admitted with acute severe colitis is therefore
essential and should be in the setting of shared care
between physician and colorectal surgeon. In particular,
three key stages of assessment in the acute setting have
been investigated in the literature: (i) on admission, (ii)
after initiation of steroid therapy, and (iii) after initia-
tion of salvage therapy.
Patients admitted with acute severe colitis should
have daily monitoring of electrolytes, liver function, full
blood count in addition to C-reactive protein (CRP)
and regular measurement of serum albumin. Steroid-
refractoriness can be predicted with an evaluation of
clinical, biochemical, endoscopic and radiological mark-
ers. Low potassium should be corrected as it may pre-
dispose to toxic dilatation. CRP and albumin are both
useful in assessing the potential for steroid resistance. A
minimum of three stool cultures upon admission is
essential
as
infectious
causes
of
colitis
should
be
excluded. Clostridium difficile infection complicating
ulcerative colitis is increasingly recognized as a cause of
severe disease and it infers an additional risk of colec-
tomy and mortality [208].
Clinical parameters to be monitored include stool
frequency, presence of rectal bleeding and abdominal
examination; while steroids may mask clinical signs of
peritonitis, subtle signs such as localized tenderness on
percussion indicate the presence of microperforations. A
limited flexible sigmoidoscopy without bowel prepara-
tion and minimal inflation performed by an experienced
endoscopist provides additional information on the
extent of disease plus severity; endoscopic criteria for
severe colitis include extensive mucosal abrasions, deep
ulcerations, ulceration edge mucosal detachment and
well-like ulceration [209,210]. The histological changes
of IBD are present as early as 7 days from the onset of
symptoms [211]. In patients with prior exposure to
immunosuppression, endoscopy should also be used to
exclude cytomegalovirus (CMV) colitis [212]. Identifi-
cation of multiple intranuclear inclusion bodies on
haematoxylin and eosin staining is a reliable means of
identifying CMV colitis, but diagnosis may require
immunohistochemistry [213]. Colonoscopy has been
evaluated in acute severe colitis but is not recom-
mended because of the risk of perforation or precipitat-
ing toxic dilatation [214].
Patients presenting with acute severe colitis should
have abdominal radiography (AXR) on admission. AXR is
useful, as apart from detecting perforation and dilatation
it can also inform about the extent of disease by assessing
both mucosal changes and proximal faecal hold-up. The
extent of underlying disease has been shown to correlate
with increased rates of progression to surgery. In particu-
lar, ulcerative colitis extending proximal to the splenic
flexure has been associated with poorer prognosis and is
predictive of steroid-refractory disease. Colonic dilatation
> 5.5 cm is suggestive of megacolon. Severe disease is
typified by loss of haustrations, mucosal irregularity and
thickening of the bowel wall. The presence of three iso-
lated small bowel loops predicts treatment failure in 73%
of patients [215]. Computed tomography scanning has
been described to aid in diagnosis of acute toxic colitis
but is not useful in assessing patients on admission [216].
Statement 4.2.
Patients admitted with acute severe colitis should
have daily monitoring of electrolytes, liver function
and full blood count in addition to regular measure-
ment of C-reactive protein and serum albumin.

 increased to 30% and with three or more the rate of
colectomy rose to 48% [201].
A reduction in stool frequency of < 40% after 5 days of
IV steroid predicts treatment failure. By contrast, stop-
ping rectal bleeding is predictive of steroid responsive-
ness. Assessment of response following 3 days of steroid
therapy should be used to guide further management and
a shared decision made with regard to surgery or rescue
therapy. In a study by Travis et al., 51 cases of acute sev-
ere colitis were treated with intensively scheduled 6-
hourly 100-mg doses of intravenous hydrocortisone and
rectal steroid enemas. Low stool frequency and CRP on
day three following steroid initiation were predictive of
treatment response, with clinical remission defined as
three or fewer stools a day with the absence of visible
blood after 7 days. Conversely, patients with more than
eight stools a day, or three to eight stools a day with
CRP > 45 mg/l had an 85% risk of steroid failure and
progression to surgery [217].
After failing to respond to 3–5 days of intravenous
corticosteroids, patients should be considered for intra-
venous
ciclosporine
(2 mg/kg/day)
or
infliximab
(5 mg/kg IV) or for colectomy. Close integration of
the surgical and stoma therapy teams in the multidisci-
plinary management team should continue and patients
counselled about colectomy as the best alternative treat-
ment for their colitis. In view of the significant numbers
of patients with acute severe colitis who ultimately
require colectomy [199], surgery should not be viewed
as treatment failure but rather as a reasonable treatment
option with potential advantages in terms of quality of
life, symptom relief and avoidance of ongoing need for
medication.
There have been many additional predictive factors
described in an effort to identify which patients are
likely to progress to colectomy at this stage. Care must
be taken to distinguish predictive factors for acute sev-
ere colitis from lesser degrees of activity:
• Age over 40 years, presence of body temperature
> 37.5°C and ongoing active disease despite treat-
ment with a thiopurine have all been associated with
failure of rescue therapy;
• High faecal calprotectin on admission was seen in
cases that failed both steroid and infliximab therapy
and progressed to colectomy within 1–8 days after
initiation of rescue therapy [218].
Several clinical predictive indices have been proven to
perform well in identifying those who require salvage
therapy within only 3–5 days of admission; patients
experiencing more than eight bloody stools per day or
three to eight stools per day plus a CRP > 45 mg/l were
both associated with a colectomy rate of 85% [217].
Lindgren et al. [219] developed the fulminant colitis
index based on the same variables as the Oxford index
(stool frequency/day + 0.14 9 CRP mg/l). Ho et al.
[220] based the Scottish index on stool frequency, the
presence of colonic dilatation and hypo-albuminaemia.
Of these the Scottish index and the Travis score have
been assessed using data from the National IBD audit.
Both predicted treatment failure with steroids. In addi-
tion, the Travis score identified those patients who were
likely to fail rescue therapy [220,221].
In a recently published study [222], an ulcerative
colitis endoscopic index of severity (UCEIS) score of
more than six on admission and faecal calprotectin
> 1000 lg/g on day three were found to be early pre-
dictors of failure of intravenous corticosteroid therapy
and the need for rescue therapy or colectomy.

developed local or systemic complications during the
admission, remained unchanged. The early colectomy
rate was similar across the four cohorts: 84.6% (11/13),
71.4% (5/7), 87.5% (7/8) and 50% (4/8) in cohorts 1,
2, 3 and 4, respectively (P = 0.2) [223].
Approximately 5% of patients with acute severe colitis
will progress to a severe toxic colitis, defined as more than
10 stools per day, daily continuous bleeding, requirement
for blood transfusion, elevated CRP (> 30 mg/l), fever
(> 37.6°C), tachycardia (90 b.p.m.), abdominal tender-
ness and distension, and colonic dilation on AXR [202].

 The majority of patients with toxic megacolon are diag-
nosed on admission. Many patients with IBD who develop
toxic megacolon will have underlying secondary gastroin-
testinal infection [213,224]. Management is the same as
for acute severe colitis with the addition of intravenous
antibiotics to cover microbial translocation and emergency
colectomy in selected cases. Careful clinical monitoring
includes reassessment throughout the initial 24 h of inten-
sive medical management, which should include repeat
AXR. Provided there is evidence of decreasing distension
and associated improvement in the patient’s clinical condi-
tion then medical management may be continued. Failure
to progress or increasing distension, deteriorating physio-
logical state and increasing CRP mandates immediate sur-
gery [202,224,225]. Steroids may attenuate physical signs,
and if there is uncertainty a CT scan may help with deci-
sion-making [216]. However, even subtle localized peri-
tonism implies potential microperforation. Given the high
potential mortality management decisions are best made by
senior surgeons and physicians.
Approximately 50% of cases will respond to medical
therapy [226]. Perforation in the presence of toxic colitis
has a high mortality rate [226,227] that increases with
increasing time interval between perforation and surgery.
Symptoms and signs may be masked by ongoing medical
therapy. Perforation is unusual in the absence of severe
toxic colitis and those patients may not have signs of clas-
sic peritonitis. In cases where the patient has taken high
doses of corticosteroids for a long time or when salvage
therapy has been prolonged beyond 7 days, the morbid-
ity rate is greatly increased [227]. Prolonged observation
(over 3 days with steroid therapy and over 7 days with
biological therapy) is counterproductive, as over time the
risk of toxic colitis and perforation increases and mortal-
ity rates remains as high as 50% [228].
Although in the past toxic colitis was thought to be a
rare complication of Crohn’s disease compared with ulcera-
tive colitis, recent studies have shown that Crohn’s colitis is
the underlying diagnosis in as many as 50% of cases [228].
Statement 4.5.
Patients with severe acute colitis and signs of colonic
distension should be closely monitored with regular
clinical review and daily abdominal radiographs to
monitor for increasing dilatation until there is defi-
nite clinical and radiological improvement. Colec-
tomy is the preferred treatment choice if there are
clinical signs of toxic megacolon or worsening dilata-
tion on abdominal radiography.

Severe bleeding in IBD
In patients with ulcerative colitis, those with severe
haemorrhage have extensive colitis and almost all have
pan-colitis. Severe bleeding in this context is an indica-
tion for urgent colectomy. Given the relative infre-
quency of severe bleeding in Crohn’s disease, available
medical literature on this topic is mostly in the form of
retrospective case series, with reported incidence rang-
ing from 0.6% to 4% [229]. In contrast to ulcerative
colitis where the bleeding is usually diffuse, in Crohn’s
disease the bleeding is often from a localized ulcer
which is not always in the colon. In a large single cen-
tre, 15% of cases were from bleeding in the small bowel
[230].
Despite the relative rarity of severe bleeding in IBD,
it accounts for approximately 5% of all urgent colec-
tomies. Bleeding can occur at any age or disease dura-
tion, but most studies suggest that the bleeding occurs
in a younger patient population [229,230]. Initial man-
agement should always include primary resuscitation
with intravenous fluids and blood transfusion as in any
patient with a significant gastrointestinal bleed. If the
patient continues to be haemodynamically unstable the
surgical team should be involved early in the course
while continuing resuscitation.
Papi et al. [231] summarized five series of haemor-
rhage in Crohn’s disease published between 1991 and
2001. Of the 101 patients included in this study, 37
(36.6%) underwent surgery during the first episode of
bleeding and 64 (63.4%) underwent nonoperative man-
agement. These figures include some cases with small
bowel disease.

with

gastrointestinal
bleeding the cumulative probability of bleeding after
diagnosis of Crohn’s disease was 1.7%, 3.6%, 6.5%
and 10.3% after 1, 5, 10 and 20 years, respectively.
Bleeding recurred in 29 patients (41.4%) after a
median time of 3.2 months. The cumulative proba-
bility of re-bleeding tended to be lower in patients
treated with infliximab than in those receiving other
treatments (P = 0.076). Both azathioprine and inflix-
imab reduce the risk of re-bleeding [232]. Similarly,
in a study population of 1374 cases of Crohn’s dis-
ease with a prevalence of acute lower gastrointestinal
bleeding of 5.3% multivariate analysis identified left
colon disease, azathioprine use > 1 year and previous
bleeding as risk factors for bleeding. Older age, sur-
gical treatment and a previous history of bleeding
were risk factors for re-bleeding. Overall mortality
was
8.2%

 Statement 4.6.
Severe lower gastrointestinal haemorrhage due to
inflammatory bowel disease is rare. After adequate
resuscitation and exclusion of other sources, severe
haemorrhage due to ulcerative colitis is usually
related to disease severity and likely to require
urgent colectomy. In Crohn’s colitis, bleeding is
often localized and may be managed using endo-
scopic
or
interventional
radiological
techniques,
although colectomy will be required in many cases.

Perforation
Free perforation occurs in approximately 2% of patients
with ulcerative colitis and is usually associated with toxic
colitis or megacolon. Occurrence without megacolon is
rare and should raise the suspicion of Crohn’s disease.
In Crohn’s disease, free perforation is also a rare but
severe complication occurring in 1–3% of all patients.
Perforations in Crohn’s disease may occur anywhere in
the gastrointestinal track including the ileum, jejunum
and gastro-duodenum. Colonic perforations account for
20–50% of all cases of perforation in Crohn’s disease
[234,235]. Colonic perforation often occurs during a
bout of toxic colitis, or acute exacerbation of chronic
disease, especially in the presence of distal obstruction.
All reported cases have been managed by colectomy
[123,234,235].
Statement 4.7.
Colonic perforation is rare in ulcerative colitis and is
usually associated with an acute flare. Colonic perfo-
ration in Crohn’s is also rare but frequently presents
in apparently quiescent disease. Colectomy is the
treatment
of
choice
for
colonic
perforation

inflammatory bowel disease.

Surgical technique
Abdominal colectomy with ileostomy is the mainstay of
the management of patients with severe colitis [236].
More and more frequently this is being attempted
laparoscopically
as
there
is
a
reduction
or
indeed
absence of adhesions compared with open colectomy.
This is particularly pertinent to facilitating subsequent
restorative surgery. Another perceived advantage is a
reduction of incisional hernias [237]. In a systematic
review and meta- analysis of nine nonrandomized stud-
ies, six cohort studies and three case-matched series
comprising 966 patients in total, the pooled risk ratio
of wound infection was 0.60 (95% CI: 0.38–0.95;
P = 0.03) and that of intra-abdominal abscess was 0.27
(0.08–0.91; P = 0.04), both in favour of laparoscopic
surgery. Pooled risk ratios for other complications
showed no significant differences. The combined con-
version rate was 5.5% with a significant reduction in
postoperative stay, again favouring laparoscopic colec-
tomy [238]. This study comprised a heterogeneous mix
of hand-assisted and total laparoscopic colectomies,
which were analysed together. There has been, to date,
no systematic review of solely laparoscopic colectomy
and there are no randomized trials of open vs laparo-
scopic colectomy. Laparotomy is still recommended in
cases with toxic dilatation, perforation and severe haem-
orrhage [202,238–240]. SILS has also been described
for subtotal colectomy in IBD. Given the small num-
bers of highly selected cases and limited evidence of
superiority over conventional laparoscopic approaches, it
has not been widely adopted [241].
Whether surgical access is open or laparoscopic the
subsequent colectomy shares common specific principles:
• The colon may be mobilized sequentially, initiated at
the caecum or sigmoid according to surgeon prefer-
ence. Mobilization starting from the right colon, with
preservation of the ileo-colic supply to distal small
bowel if a subsequent pouch is planned, is often more
common in open surgery. In laparoscopic surgery,
transection of the rectosigmoid with subsequent left
initial colon mobilization may be preferred. Neither
approach is associated with particular benefit. Where
omentum is adherent to the colon it should be resected
en bloc to avoid soiling from underlying sealed perfora-
tions (commonly encountered at the splenic flexure).
• If the colon is extremely friable then an open proce-
dure is indicated. The resection technique should be
modified to initial early division of the bowel and
sequential division of the mesentery with packing of
the bowel into a bowel bag to avoid excessive soiling
[202].
• In cases with severe dysplasia, cancer or a mass lesion
then colectomy is performed with high ligation of the
lymphovascular pedicles.
• The inferior mesenteric artery is preserved if a restora-
tive procedure is planned for a later date.
There are several options for handling of the rectal
stump, and this continues to be a subject of debate.
Intra-peritoneal stump closure with division of the rec-
tosigmoid at the pelvic brim with rectal drainage has a
low complication rate
and is thought to facilitate

 subsequent restorative surgery [242,243]. Closure with
subcutaneous placement of the stump necessitates leav-
ing a longer length of sigmoid and rectum with a sub-
sequent
high
incidence
of
wound
breakdown.
Proponents of this technique argue that wound break-
down is a less morbid complication than intra-peritoneal
stump breakdown [244], that the rectal stump is easily
located at the time of restorative surgery and that sub-
cutaneous
stump
placement
is
more
acceptable
to
patients than the other alternative of exteriorizing the
distal bowel as a mucous fistula. In reality many sur-
geons advocate selective use of either exterior intra-
abdominal closure depending on the severity of disease
at time of surgery [245]. In a retrospective series that
compared both intra- and extraperitoneal closure there
was no difference in morbidity; neither technique could
offset the risk of pelvic sepsis. Subcutaneous placement
of colorectal stump was associated with more frequent
but less morbid complications. [246].
It should be noted that, in the laparoscopic era, the
intraperitoneal technique has a distinct advantage when
it comes to restorative surgery. A completion proctec-
tomy can begin laparoscopically using the same port
sites previously selected for the colectomy. In those
cases where the rectosigmoid stump is brought to the
subcutaneous tissue, it is necessary to begin a comple-
tion proctectomy with mobilization of the colorectal
segment using the existing extraction site incision. The
majority of laparoscopic series favour intraperitoneal clo-
sure even if the authors previously favoured subcuta-
neous closure [247]. The current rectal stump leak rate
in large series ranges from 0 to 5% [246].
Statement 4.8
There are short-term advantages in a laparoscopic
approach to colectomy where feasible. An initial
laparoscopic approach may also facilitate subsequent
planned restorative procedures. Laparotomy is rec-
ommended in emergency cases with toxic dilatation,
perforation and severe haemorrhage. If indicated,
colectomy should not be delayed due to lack of
laparoscopic expertise.

Perioperative management
Nutrition
Inflammatory Bowel Disease patients undergoing total
colectomy will frequently be malnourished. Patients
with
weight
loss
> 10%,
body
mass
index
(BMI) < 18.5 kg/m2 or albumin < 30 g/l have been
shown to be at significantly increased risk of postopera-
tive complications [237,241]. Nutritional guidelines for
IBD were published by the European Society for Clini-
cal Nutrition and Metabolism (ESPEN) in 2017 [248].
Most recommendations are based on consensus among
experts or extrapolated from the general surgical popu-
lation. Specific recommendations in the perioperative
period are avoidance of long periods of preoperative
fasting, re-establishment of oral feeding as early as pos-
sible after surgery, integration of nutrition into the
overall management of the patient, metabolic control
(e.g. of blood glucose) and early mobilization.
Patients with acute colitis can usually be managed
both pre- and postoperatively with oral nutritional sup-
plements. In a randomized trial of 42 patients with
moderate to severe flares of ulcerative colitis, enteral
nutrition increased median serum albumin by 16.7%
(0.5–30.4%) whereas parenteral nutrition was associated
with only a 4.6% gain (12.0–13.7%) (P = 0.019). Ent-
eral feeding was also associated with a much lower com-
plication rate [249].
The benefits of early feeding have been evaluated by
a Cochrane Review. Fourteen RCTs representing a total
of 1224 patients all undergoing gastrointestinal surgery
were assessed. Individual clinical complications failed to
reach statistical significance, but the direction of effect
suggests that earlier feeding may reduce the risk of
postsurgical complications. Mortality was the only out-
come to show a significant benefit, but was not neces-
sarily associated with early commencement of feeding,
as the reported causes of death were anastomotic leak-
age, reoperation and acute myocardial infarction [250].
In patients undergoing emergency surgery, artificial
nutrition should be initiated if the patient is malnour-
ished at the time of surgery or if oral diet cannot be
recommenced within 7 days after surgery. Patients with
acute toxic colitis are most likely to need parenteral
nutrition.

Prevention of venous thromboembolism
There is extensive data that patients with active IBD
have an increased risk of both venous and arterial
thrombosis due to a hyper-coagulable state [251] (see
Section 1). Thrombo-prophylaxis does not appear to
precipitate excessive bleeding during flares of IBD, even
in patients experiencing bloody diarrhoea, and is recom-
mended in all patients with acute severe colitis [252].
Despite this evidence and extensive recommendations in
guidelines the uptake of the routine use of venous
thromboembolism prophylaxis by physicians is still low
[253]. Results from the UK national IBD audit are
more reassuring with incremental increases demon-
strated for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis from
2008 to 2012 and use in 94% of inpatients reported in
the 2014 audit report [200].
Involvement of a stoma therapist
Approximately one-fifth of stomas have to be sited in
an emergency; 15% of patients undergo surgery without
the stoma site having been marked in advance [254].
The difficulties of stoma siting by the operating surgeon
have been studied prospectively against the gold stan-
dard of a qualified stoma therapist and found to be
inadequate [255].
Preoperative stoma site marking and counselling aim
to improve patient rehabilitation and adaptation to a
new medical condition. In a prospective study to evalu-
ate the impact of preoperative siting on quality of life,
independence and complications were evaluated utiliz-
ing a validated assessment tool. A total of 52 patients
were marked and 53 not marked. There was a signifi-
cant difference in favour of the premarked group in
18/20 items assessed [256]. Bass et al. compared the
outcomes of 292 patients whose stoma sites were
marked compared with 301 patients whose stomas were
not marked. The authors reported that the overall com-
plication rates in the marked and the unmarked groups
were 32.5% and 43.5%, respectively, with significantly
more early postoperative complications occurring in the
unmarked patients (P < 0.0075) [257].

Steroid therapy
Most patients having a colectomy will be either refrac-
tory to medical therapy or have acute severe colitis.
Almost invariably patients will have been on corticos-
teroids for some time or be on supra-physiological
doses of steroid (> 10 mg prednisolone). It is well rec-
ognized that patients who have used corticosteroids
within the past year are at greater risk for adrenal insuf-
ficiency, especially following surgery, and may need
stress-dose corticosteroids perioperatively. In a survey of
practice published in 1996, 84% of 348 colorectal sur-
geons
would
administer
100 mg of
hydrocortisone
phosphate intravenously before surgery. Sixty-two per
cent would give 100 mg of hydrocortisone phosphate
intravenously every 8 h postoperatively, tapering the
dose
to
50 mg
intravenously
every
8–12 h.
Most
patients (49%) received 20 mg of prednisone per day
when their oral intake was resumed with a slow taper
over several weeks [258].
The frequent use of such large (stress) doses was
stimulated by reports of mortality from adrenal failure.
However, the dose of cortisone required to cause adre-
nal insufficiency is unknown, as is the duration of treat-
ment
that
can
accurately
predict
its
development,
although it is commonly believed that several weeks of
systemic corticosteroid supplementation are required
before adrenal gland function is suppressed. What is
known is that subjects on corticosteroids may be able to
respond to surgical stress by increasing endogenous cor-
ticosteroids and do not necessarily require large doses
of steroid [259]. Friedman performed 35 major ortho-
paedic surgeries among 28 patients receiving chronic
steroids (mean daily dose of prednisone 10 mg) without
administration of stress-dosed corticosteroids and noted
no clinical evidence of adrenal insufficiency [260].
Zaghiyan et al. [261] reported no significant improve-
ment in postoperative haemodynamic stability with the
use of high-dose perioperative corticosteroids compared
with a low dose or none.

is

vary from 5–6% in population-based studies for emer-
gency
colectomy
and
0–1.5%
for

surgery
[35,40,244,264–266]. Factors contributing to mortality
include low hospital total colectomy volume, comorbid-
ity and greater age. Rates of morbidity and mortality
after colectomy for ulcerative colitis are associated with
hospital volume [33].
Subsequent restorative surgery
Having a colectomy in a low-volume hospital also
decreases the odds of subsequent reconstruction. Recon-
struction after colectomy is variable depending on coun-
try and whether IBD surgery is centralized. In a Swedish
population-based cohort study over 10 years, 2017
colectomies were performed from a total of 2818 IBD
operations. In patients initially treated with a subtotal
colectomy with an ileostomy, only one-third (680/
2017) had their intestinal continuity restored [40]. Previ-
ous hospital-based studies have shown that 42–70% of
patients undergo reconstructive surgery after colectomy
[247,267] (49, 50, 54, 86). Of those who do not
undergo reconstruction the rate of subsequent proctec-
tomy varies from 86% in older series to 18% in the era of
pouch surgery. Of the 20% who choose to keep the rec-
tum many will default surveillance endoscopy [268].

Appendicectomy and ulcerative colitis
There is substantial epidemiological, experimental and
clinical evidence that the appendix plays a role in the
development and course of ulcerative colitis [270–272].
A systematic review has shown that appendicectomy
might influence the disease course in ulcerative colitis
patients, with possible reduction in relapse rates and
reduction in the need for immunosuppression and for
more extensive surgery [84]. The benefit appears most
pronounced for those with proctitis and distal colitis
[84]. As the quality of evidence is poor and there may
be an increased risk of dysplasia after appendicectomy
[273] high-quality research is required before appen-
dicectomy can be definitively recommended as therapy
for patients with ulcerative colitis. One such study is
currently recruiting [85].

 proctocolectomy remains the only treatment (surgical
or medical) to eradicate and ‘cure’ ulcerative colitis. It
retains an important place amongst the available treat-
ments despite committing patients to a permanent end
ileostomy, and all other procedures should be evaluated
in comparison with it [274,275].
Crohn’s disease remains an unwise indication for
the
ileoanal
pouch
procedure
(sometimes
called
restorative proctocolectomy) and so (pan)proctocolec-
tomy in the case of Crohn’s colitis or less frequently
proctectomy alone remain important treatment choices
[276].
In this section, the term proctocolectomy will be
used in preference to panproctocolectomy to describe
complete removal of the colon, rectum and anus. Surgi-
cal removal of the rectum alone with sparing of the
colon is described as proctectomy, with the term com-
pletion proctectomy used when the colon has already
been removed. This guideline does not discuss the Kock
pouch as an alternative to end ileostomy as this is cov-
ered in Section 8.
Indications for proctocolectomy and proctectomy
Ulcerative colitis
Proctocolectomy is an operation that is rarely indicated
in an emergency setting. In theory, a proctocolectomy
may be indicated in an emergency situation if there is
massive haemorrhage from the rectum or perforation
of the rectum, although both are extremely rare occur-
rences. Most surgeons would consider subtotal colec-
tomy and ileostomy most appropriate for fulminant or
perforated colitis. This can be performed successfully
either laparoscopically or by open surgery [277]. The
procedure requires the formation of an ileostomy, with
either exteriorization of the rectosigmoid stump as a
mucous fistula or subcutaneous burial beneath the
lower end of the wound to mitigate the consequences
of stump leak [278] or with internal rectal closure at
the pelvic brim.
The more common indications for proctocolectomy
in ulcerative colitis can be categorized as either urgent
or elective. Broadly speaking, urgent indications result
from a failure to control disease with medical manage-
ment and the elective indications are for reducing the
risk of, or treating, neoplasia. In both situations, the
option of ileoanal pouch formation and the likely func-
tional outcomes should be discussed as appropriate with
the individual patient. Predictors of poor pouch func-
tion, such as poor continence, mobility or other anorec-
tal
disease,
may
lead
some
patients
to
choose
proctocolectomy
over
ileoanal
pouch
and
avoid
a
reduced
quality
of
life
and
the
need
for
further
interventions. A diagnosis of rectal cancer may lead to a
preference of proctocolectomy over ileoanal pouch for-
mation, although it is not an absolute contraindication.
The effect of preoperative radiotherapy for a rectal can-
cer on subsequent pouch function is not well docu-
mented,
but
as
might
be
expected
postoperative
radiotherapy of a pouch increases complications and
failure rates [279]. Clearly if locally advanced rectal can-
cer is identified before surgery, careful planning to avoid
pouch radiation is required.
It is important when counselling the patient to
make it clear that quality of life may be very good
after a proctocolectomy and ileostomy. Although lim-
ited by small sample size, significant heterogeneity and
limited follow-up, a meta-analysis has suggested equiv-
alent overall health-related quality of life between total
proctocolectomy with ileostomy and ileoanal pouch
anastomosis [280].

Crohn’s disease
The indications for proctocolectomy in Crohn’s colitis
are more complex. This is because the pattern of disease
may allow less extensive alternatives to removal of the
colon, rectum and anus. Clearly if there is uncontrolled
pan-colorectal disease a proctocolectomy is the only
option. Similarly, more radical surgery is required when
the indication for surgery is cancer or high-grade dys-
plasia,
because
metachronous
disease
is
common
[281,282]. Although the evidence is less strong, several
studies have demonstrated that perianal Crohn’s disease
is associated with increased risk of recurrence which
may be complex [283,284], suggesting that more radi-
cal excision and stoma formation in this situation may
give the optimal long-term outcome. In cases with iso-
lated segmental colonic disease, a segmental colectomy
or subtotal colectomy and ileorectal anastomosis are
bowel-preserving options. Indeed, in disease isolated to
the anorectum, a proctectomy only may occasionally be
carried out [99,276].
All these circumstances require a balance in judge-
ment and decision-making, and careful counselling of
the patient. Proctocolectomy results in lower rates of

 recurrent Crohn’s disease but the risks of perineal
wound
and
stoma
complications
are
higher.
The
effects of a stoma on quality of life must also be con-
sidered. Less radical options potentially reduce compli-
cations and may avoid a stoma but at the expense of
higher recurrence [285,286] and the potential for fur-
ther surgery. A recent meta-analysis [287] concluded
that segmental, subtotal and proctocolectomy were
equally effective treatment options for patients with
colonic Crohn’s disease and the choice of operation
remains fundamentally dependent on the extent of
colonic disease. A lower recurrence rate with panproc-
tocolectomy was confirmed and segmental colectomy
had the highest risk of postoperative complications. If
the extent of disease allows for more than one of
these options, then these data should be taken into
account when counselling patients.
Statement 5.2
In Crohn’s colitis, segmental colectomy, subtotal
colectomy and proctocolectomy are equally effective
treatment options with the choice of operation
dependent on the extent of colonic disease. Procto-
colectomy will reduce risks of recurrence of colorectal
disease at the expense of a higher complication rate
than subtotal colectomy and a permanent stoma.

Indication for completion proctectomy
Completion proctectomy with removal of the rectum
and anus is undertaken following a previous subtotal
colectomy and is a procedure which commits the
patient to a permanent end stoma. The indications for
this procedure may be slightly different between ulcera-
tive colitis and Crohn’s disease.
Ulcerative colitis
The rate of proctectomy is relatively higher in patients
with ulcerative colitis compared with Crohn’s disease.
The pattern of disease in ulcerative colitis is such that it
almost always involves the rectum and progresses proxi-
mally to produce a pan-colitis in some patients. Follow-
ing subtotal colectomy, the rectal stump may produce
significant symptoms in terms of discharge and discom-
fort. Severe symptoms, dysplasia and the risk of malig-
nancy
are
all
indications
for
proctectomy.
Recent
population data from Sweden suggest that although the
risk of malignancy in a defunctioned rectum or after
ileorectal anastomosis is low, it remains higher than in
the general population. This study of 5886 patients
demonstrated an increased risk in the presence of scle-
rosing cholangitis or if there was preexisting dysplasia in
the rectum or colon [288]. The decision should be
considered in the context of a choice of possible
restorative procedures, either the ileoanal pouch (see
Section 6) or less commonly ileorectal anastomosis (see
Section 7).
Statement 5.3.
Indications for completion proctectomy in ulcerative
colitis include ongoing symptoms from the rectal
stump and avoidance of future malignancy. Dysplasia
in the rectal stump in IBD is a strong indication for
early completion proctectomy. Patients with scleros-
ing cholangitis or dysplasia present in the initial
colectomy specimen are at high risk of malignancy
in the retained rectum.

Grade of recommendation: B
Consensus: 97.0% (SA 63.6%, A 33.3%)
Crohn’s disease
Preservation of the rectum in patients with Crohn’s col-
itis is more likely than in ulcerative colitis due to the
possibility of disease sparing the rectum. Medical ther-
apy may be used to reduce rectal disease activity and
allow restoration of continuity with formation of an ile-
orectal anastomosis.
Indications for completion proctectomy in Crohn’s
disease include significant perianal fistulating disease,
anal stricture or active proctitis, leading to poor bowel
function if ileorectal anastomosis is undertaken. As
mentioned above in regard to proctocolectomy, colonic
or rectal malignancy is a strong indication for proctec-
tomy since there is a significant incidence of metachro-
nous colorectal cancers [281,282,289,290]. Although
endoscopic surveillance can be considered many would
also view colonic or rectal dysplasia as an indication for
proctectomy. In the absence of dysplasia in the rectal
remnant the risk of malignancy in the retained rectum
is lower, so some may chose the option of surveillance
to allow rectal preservation and restoration of continuity
following a subtotal colectomy [291,292].
Surveillance of a retained rectum in IBD
If preservation of the rectal remnant is selected for ulcera-
tive colitis or Crohn’s disease, then surveillance should
be carried out in accordance with BSG guidance. Essen-
tially screening should start at around 10 years after
onset of symptoms. This should be continued 5-yearly if

 the patient is considered low risk or yearly if high risk
[previous dysplasia in the colon, presence of primary scle-
rosing cholangitis or persistent atrophy and inflammation
of the rectal mucosa (BSG guidelines)] (see Section 6).
Timing of surgery
In an ideal situation, preoperative steroids should be
reduced and stopped, and immunosuppression halted;
however, this is often not practical. If the patient is
unable to reduce a high dose of steroids then considera-
tion should be given to subtotal colectomy and ileost-
omy at this point with more definitive surgery later
when the medication can be reduced or stopped (see
Sections 5 and 13).
Physical and mental recovery from the initial surgery
is important prior to definitive surgery being under-
taken. Withdrawal of corticosteroids and immunosup-
pressive therapeutic agents may reduce the risk of
postoperative complications, especially sepsis, although
the evidence for the role of the latter is not as strong
[293–295]. Restoration of nutritional status is also key
to quick recovery from surgery and the promotion of
perineal wound healing. These factors are important in
the decision regarding timing of proctocolectomy or
completion proctectomy.
A delay in proctocolectomy, completion proctectomy
or a restorative procedure may be considered in a
woman until after completion of her family to avoid the
risk of tubal adhesions secondary to pelvic surgery with
its impact on fertility and fecundity [296,297] More
recent evidence suggests that a laparoscopic approach
may reduce this risk [294,298].
As in all patients undergoing major colorectal proce-
dures a thorough preassessment and consent process is
important which may include cardiopulmonary exercise
testing in patients with significant comorbidity.

Technical aspects of surgery
Perioperative care
There is no requirement for mechanical bowel prepara-
tion
before
proctocolectomy
or
completion
proctectomy. There will be no anastomosis and the
dehydration caused by purgative laxatives is not justified.
Prophylactic antibiotic use is recommended and there is
no strong evidence to suggest that there is a benefit to
extended use of prophylaxis in this group of patients.
Laparoscopic versus open surgery
The advantages of laparoscopic surgery in terms of
patient recovery and fewer long-term adhesion-related
problems are well described and detailed in other sec-
tions. There are no RCTs that compare the two meth-
ods in proctocolectomy alone. Open surgery remains a
pragmatic approach where laparoscopy is not available,
although if available it should be preferred.
High versus low vessel ligation
In the absence of dysplasia and with an indication for
surgery of poorly controlled medical treatment it seems
reasonable to forego high ligation of vessels. However,
in the presence of malignancy or high-grade dysplasia,
normal oncological principles and planes should be
observed.
Preservation of omentum
There is no evidence to support the excision of the
omentum en bloc with the transverse colon or its careful
preservation in surgery for ulcerative colitis or Crohn’s
disease. The omentum may be important in moderating
the immune response following surgery and be useful in
filling the pelvis after the rectum is removed. However
the omentum, if poorly preserved, may be a source of
internal herniation and adhesion formation.
Rectal excision
The two major discussion points relating to rectal exci-
sion, either as part of a proctocolectomy or as comple-
tion proctectomy, are the preferred planes for rectal
dissection (close rectal dissection vs total mesorectal
excision, TME) and perineal excision (intersphincteric
dissection vs an extrasphincteric approach). If there is
malignancy
or
high-grade
dysplasia,
the
approach
should be one of TME from above and intersphincteric
dissection from below only if the tumour is high
enough in the rectum to allow this safely. The advan-
tages of close rectal dissection are that by preserving the
mesorectum, the risk of nerve damage is minimized and
in addition there remains a smaller ‘dead space’ in the
pelvis which may decrease the rate of pelvic sepsis and
perineal hernia. This is offset by being more technically
difficult to many surgeons who are much more familiar
with the TME plane of dissection, and there is a poten-
tially increased risk of bleeding. The use of energy
devices potentially decreases the bleeding risk.

 Similarly, the advantage of performing the perineal
part of the procedure in the intersphincteric plane is
that by minimizing the size of the skin incision, wound
healing is improved [299,300]. Severe perianal disease
in Crohn’s disease may alter the approach on the per-
ineal part of the dissection in order to minimize poor
healing and sinus formation. This may even necessitate
the involvement of plastic surgeons and the placement
of a myocutaneous flap at the time of primary surgery

New techniques
Other recent developments in rectal surgery may have an
impact in the future but have yet to find their place in IBD
surgery. Proponents of robotic surgery argue that a
reduced risk of urinary and sexual dysfunction may be one
of the great advantages, and we await trial data [304,305].
Although a proctectomy often involves an abdominal
and a perineal approach, it is possible to carry out com-
pletion
proctectomy
exclusively
via
a
transperineal
approach [306]. Using ultrasound dissection and with
the patient prone, a close rectal dissection can be carried
out to remove up to 25 cm of rectal stump.
Transanal TME (TaTME) has been described in small
series for completion proctectomy but its use is now
being explored more widely in rectal cancer [307]. It is
possible to extrapolate this technique to incorporate a
close rectal dissection plane. TaTME may have advan-
tages in terms of nerve sparing, single stapled anastomo-
sis, distal margin selection and potentially better function
but it also has disadvantages in terms of technical chal-
lenge and the potential to cause damage to surrounding
structures if done incorrectly. Further studies are needed
to confirm whether this technique has merit.
Outcomes
Proctocolectomy is associated with fewer postoperative
complications than ileoanal pouch formation. One often
quoted series states the difference as 26% vs 52% [308].
After stomal problems, perineal wound healing is one of
the most significant complications after proctocolec-
tomy or completion proctectomy and is not necessarily
reduced in the latter [309]. The risk may be amelio-
rated
by
intersphincteric
dissection
where
possible
[300]. Failed primary perineal wound healing is more
common in patients treated for Crohn’s disease (re-
ported in up to 50%) than ulcerative colitis [310–312].
If it is possible to preserve the omentum and mobilize
it sufficiently to reach the pelvis, particularly if there has
been a TME approach, this may improve primary
wound healing and reduce infection [313].

improved blood supply and oxygenation. After shrink-
age of the cavity and removal of sepsis, the cavity can
often be closed by suturing the external sphincter. In

There is an increasing focus of research on the role
of the mesentery and its role in the recurrence of
Crohn’s disease. This has been extrapolated to the
mesorectum, and there is a suggestion that whilst close
rectal dissection may be useful in ulcerative colitis, leav-
ing the mesorectum in Crohn’s disease may be deleteri-
ous and a TME may be better, although more evidence
is awaited [175, 320].
Urinary and sexual dysfunction can occur with any
pelvic dissection. In men this may result in impotence
or retrograde ejaculation. It is difficult to be clear of the
absolute risk, early commentators noting 3% [321].
Laparoscopic surgery may decrease rates, perhaps by
better visualization [322]. The removal of the rectum
can lead to a change in the axis of the vagina in women
and create problems. This might be prevented by plac-
ing the omentum in the pelvis to fill the space left after
proctectomy. Nevertheless women should be counselled
about potential problems postoperatively [323].
Finally, there are a number of individual case reports
of cancer of the ileostomy in patients with proctocolec-
tomy performed for ulcerative colitis, underlining the
need to maintain links with stoma care and patient edu-
cation [324].

IBD. In general, these are usually planned procedures

Ileoanal pouch surgery
The ileoanal pouch procedure, or restorative procto-
colectomy as it was originally described [325], has revo-
lutionized the treatment of patients with ulcerative
colitis who require surgery. It offers a potential cure for
the disease whilst allowing restoration of bowel conti-
nuity. With nearly 40 years of experience there is a
wealth of evidence to guide surgeons on the nuances of
surgical technique and help them explain expected out-
comes to patients considering pouch surgery.
Patient selection
Patients with ulcerative colitis who may be considered
for pouch surgery essentially fall into three groups: sev-
ere acute colitis, chronic colitis refractory to medical
therapy or those with dysplastic or neoplastic changes.
However, the decision to undergo an ileoanal pouch is
complex. Alternative surgical procedures exist and con-
sist of colectomy/proctocolectomy and a permanent
stoma, ileorectal anastomosis or Koch pouch. These
alternative procedures are discussed in Sections 5, 7 and
8, respectively. There are clear advantages of a pouch
procedure compared with these alternatives: avoidance
of a permanent stoma, resection of all disease and
potential cure. These need to be weighed against the
potential disadvantages of an ileoanal pouch: the proce-
dure may be challenging with a relatively high incidence
of short- and long-term complications and an ultimate
failure rate of over 6% [326]. In addition, functional

 outcomes are seldom perfect and there are circum-
stances where pouch surgery may be inadvisable [327].
Most specialists would advise that a multidisciplinary
team (including surgeon, gastroenterologist and pouch
nurse specialist) should be involved in any decision
regarding recommendation of a pouch procedure and
there should be a rigorous counselling process to advise
the patient of potential outcomes of surgery as well as
alternatives.

Types of pouches
Parks’ S pouch was the original
ileoanal reservoir
described in 1978 [328]. In 1980, Parks et al. reported
outcomes in 21 patients [329]. Although all were conti-
nent during the day, 11 patients had to use a catheter
to evacuate the pouch due to difficulty related to the
length of the efferent spout. The W pouch was pro-
posed by Nicholls and Pezim in 1984 [330], the poten-
tial advantages being a lower frequency of defaecation
and no requirement for pouch intubation. Technically,
the W pouch was not more difficult to construct,
although it was more time-consuming. The bulkier con-
figuration of the pouch may also result in difficulties in
a patient with a narrow pelvis. Fifty centimetres of
ileum is required for W pouch construction compared
with 30–40 cm for a J pouch. The J pouch is the most
widely performed modern pouch configuration because
it is technically easy to construct and results in good
function without the need for pouch intubation due to
direct anastomosis of the pouch to the anal canal. Both
pouch construction and pouch–anal anastomosis may be
undertaken with hand-sewn or stapling techniques,
although the latter now predominate.
Three randomized trials comparing J and W pouches
have been published [331–333]. Two trials showed no
difference in function between J and W pouches at
12 months of follow-up [331,332]. A further trial of
24 patients showed a mean daily defaecation frequency
of three for W pouches and five for J pouches at
12 months [333]. In this study, the W pouch was also
associated with significantly less night-time defaecation
and significantly less usage of antidiarrhoeals. A subse-
quent meta-analysis of 18 studies comprising 1519
patients concluded that all three reservoirs had similar
complication rates. The S pouch was associated with
the need for anal intubation. There was less frequency
and less need for antidiarrhoeal agents with the W
pouch compared with the J pouch [334]. However,
long-term outcome data are not available and frequent
reports of massive distension of W pouches over dec-
ades of follow-up may represent a real issue within clin-
ical practice.

Construction
of
the
ileal
pouch
and
pouch–anal
anastomosis
The pouch and pouch–anal anastomosis may be con-
structed using various techniques.
In hand-sewn pouch–anal anastomosis with mucosec-
tomy the mucosectomy of the anorectal canal is per-
formed
by
sharp
dissection
through
a
trans-anal
approach. The pouch is then brought through the anal
canal and a sutured pouch–anal anastomosis performed.
This allows precise determination of the level of pouch–
anal anastomosis and avoids the possibility of leaving
rectal mucosa behind.
In stapled pouch–anal anastomosis a transverse sta-
pling device is applied at the level of the anorectal junc-
tion and the bowel is then divided. The anvil of a
circular stapling device is held within the pouch with a
purse-string suture. The circular stapling device is then
inserted transanally and the pin deployed through the
transversely stapled distal anorectum to connect and
close the anvil and finally create the pouch–anal anasto-
mosis by firing the instrument. A stapled anastomosis is
easier and quicker to perform and may cause less trauma
to the anal sphincter. However, the technique will leave
rectal mucosa behind. Subsequent inflammation of this
mucosa (cuffitis) can cause functional problems (see

 below). In addition, there is a theoretical risk of dys-
plasia in this cuff.
A meta-analysis of 21 studies including 4183 patients
concluded that both anastomotic techniques had similar
postoperative outcomes; however, a stapled procedure
resulted in improvement in nocturnal incontinence.
Data on dysplasia were inconclusive [335]. A large
prospective study of 3109 patients suggested superior
function and better quality of life in the stapled group
[336]. A subsequent meta-analysis of RCTs only sug-
gested no functional difference between techniques
[337]. Ten-year follow-up of the double-stapled tech-
nique has shown the incidence of cuff dysplasia to be
4.5% [338]. While there have been reports of cancer
developing
following
an
ileoanal
pouch,
this
has
occurred after mucosectomy as well as after the double-
stapled technique [339]. Indeed, residual islands of rec-
tal mucosa may remain at the ileoanal anastomosis in up
to 7% of patients after mucosectomy [340].

Role of pouch diversion
Pelvic sepsis occurs in about 5% of patients undergoing
ileal pouch–anal anastomosis (IPAA) [341]. The pres-
ence of sepsis increases the pouch failure rate substan-
tially (26%, compared with 5.9% in patients without this
complication) and results in poorer function for those
who retain the pouch [341]. Apart from the longer-
term poorer functional outcomes, sepsis may also be life
threatening.
The use of a defunctioning ileostomy may help to
reduce the incidence or impact of pelvic sepsis. However,
mechanical and functional complications may follow
ileostomy creation. Readmission rates of up 15% for
dehydration have been reported [342]. Subsequent
reversal also carries risks. One large series of 1504
patients reported a morbidity rate of 11.4% (mainly small
bowel obstruction) and a mortality rate of 0.06% [343].
Omitting a loop ileostomy has the attractive advan-
tages of requiring only one hospital admission and avoid-
ing these potential complications. A review of 17 studies
comprising 1486 patients reported no difference in func-
tional outcome [39]. However, the development of a
pouch-related leak was significantly more common in the
no-ileostomy group and the rate of pelvic sepsis was sig-
nificantly lower in patients with a temporary ileostomy.
Despite this review, the current data lack the power to
robustly determine whether a pouch should be routinely
defunctioned or not. It appears justified to omit diver-
sion in selected optimized patients, provided leaks are
identified early and salvaged. Nevertheless, three-quar-
ters of pouch procedures in the UK are currently com-
bined with a defunctioning stoma [38,344].
Statement 6.4.
Most surgeons currently use a diverting ileostomy
when
undertaking
pouch
surgery,
although
the
diverting ileostomy may be reasonably omitted in
well-selected and optimized patients. Early diagnosis
with prompt treatment of pelvic sepsis is essential in
all patients, especially those who are not diverted, in
order to avoid long-term pouch dysfunction.

Laparoscopic pouch surgery is technically feasible and
safe, and is performed using the same principles as the
open procedure. Relative contraindications are multiple
intra-abdominal adhesions and obesity. A theoretical
advantage of a laparoscopic approach is the reduction in
adhesions. Following open ileoanal pouch surgery, small
bowel obstruction occurs in up to 25% [345,346] with
one-quarter of these patients requiring reoperation.
Despite this a Cochrane Review concluded that short-
term advantages of the laparoscopic approach seem to
be limited and their clinical significance arguable [347].
A more recent meta-analysis suggests equivalent adverse
event rates and long-term functional results to open
surgery
but

evidence
is
underpowered to detect true differences [348]. Both
meta-analyses include studies that were published many

dence that a laparoscopic approach offers significant
advantages over open pouch surgery [349]. Regarding

Intra-operative complications
Failure of the pouch to reach: the inability to achieve
adequate mobility of the small bowel in order to anas-
tomose the ileal pouch to the anal canal may be
reduced by adequate patient selection. Certainly, a high
BMI may predispose to lack of reach, and such patients
should be encouraged to lose weight if circumstances
permit. Adequate mobility and length should be con-
firmed prior to pouch construction. There is adequate
mobility if the apex of the pouch lies 6 cm below the
pubic symphysis [353]. If this is not the case, several
steps can be taken to improve mobility:
• Scoring (‘laddering’) of the peritoneum of the small
bowel mesentery
• Further mobilization of the small bowel to expose
the third part of the duodenum and pancreas
• Construction of mesenteric windows [354]
• Division of the ileocaecal artery [355]
• Use of an S pouch [356]
• Use of an interposition vein graft to the superior
mesenteric artery [357].
Transverse or circular stapler failure: failure of firing
of either the transverse or circular stapler often requires
mucosectomy and transanal hand-sewn technique to
complete the anastomosis. J-shaped needles may allow
more manoeuvrability and bite within the narrow con-
fines of the anal canal [358].
Laparoscopic
complications:
current
laparoscopic
instrumentation makes cross-stapling of the anal stump
challenging. Multiple firings of a laparoscopic stapler may
result in a jagged transverse staple line. Alternatively, the
distal rectum may be stapled too proximally. A utility
Pfannensteil incision to both remove the specimen and
allow
introduction
of
a
transverse
stapler
may
be
employed. Transanal techniques have also been employed
[359]. A totally intracorporeal laparoscopic approach has
two particular risks. A 180° twist in the pouch may be
easily overlooked and risks loss of the pouch. Extra
caution must also be exercised to not incorporate the
vaginal wall in the anastomosis [358,360].
Immediate postoperative complications: haemorrhage
from staple line bleeding may be controlled with exami-
nation under anaesthetic, Foley catheter insertion and
irrigation. Adrenaline solution or even cautious dia-
thermy/suture ligation of a bleeding vessel may be pos-
sible. Failure to control may require laparotomy.
Sepsis is common, occurring in up to 25% of patients
[358], and is the commonest cause of pouch failure.
Intra-abdominal abscesses require percutaneous drai-
nage and antibiotic therapy. Pelvic abscesses that cannot
be drained percutaneously require examination under
anaesthesia and drainage through the anastomosis if
possible. The
use of endoscopically
placed
suction
devices is beneficial [361]. Prompt treatment may sal-
vage the pouch whereas delay results in a stiff noncom-
plaint pouch and pouch excision in 40% [362].
An abscess may result in a persistent anastomotic
sinus [363]. Perhaps 50% may heal with prolonged
defunctioning; for those that do not, curettage and
deroofing may help [364]. Gluing of the sinus track has
been described [365] but is of uncertain benefit.

Awareness and prompt treatment of common post-
operative problems after pouch surgery is essential
to avoid unnecessary morbidity and preserve long-
term pouch function.

Postoperative pouch function
Most studies on pouch function are now quite dated.
Generally, function is influenced by the length of fol-
low-up [366], although it appears to remain remarkably
stable after the first 1–2 years following construction
[367]. Children adapt more quickly than adults and
there is a lower frequency of defaecation in adolescents
6 months after ileostomy closure than in adults [368].
Assessment of functional outcome is complicated by the
lack of uniformity in defining continence, urgency and
soiling [369] and is modified by the presence of co-
existing irritable bowel syndrome, which may in part
explain the enormous variation in defaecation frequency
in patients followed up for 2 years or more [370].
The incidence of complete continence varies widely,
because of the lack of uniformity in both definition and
patient perception. With these caveats, complete conti-
nence in pouch patients occurs in over 80% in most

 carefully audited series. In addition, most series suggest
that 15–30% of patients need to use pads and that up
to 16% of patients may be incontinent [371,372].
However, over 30% of patients may be incontinent of
flatus [373].
Soiling is a common complication [374], occurring
in up to 20% of patients during the day but over 50% at
night [375], and is responsible for perianal excoriation,
seen in up to 40% of patients at 1 year. Soiling is gener-
ally more common in patients who have had a mucosec-
tomy [376]. Soiling does seem to improve with time:
Wexner et al. [371] found that in 63% of patients soil-
ing became less troublesome up to 5 years after opera-
tion.
Ability to distinguish between gas, liquid and solids
appears to be preserved in around 90% of patients
[377]. Discrimination is preserved even with loss of the
anal transition zone and an anastomosis at the dentate
line [378]. Urgency is the one symptom that is almost
universally improved after a pouch procedure, provided
there is no pouchitis. In one large study deferment of
defaecation for longer than 1 h was a feature of all
patients, and 84% said that they could defer defaecation
for more than 2 h [379].
As mentioned earlier, there is an enormous variation in
stool frequency, determined largely by diet. Nevertheless
it is clear that frequency of defaecation improves with
duration of follow-up, being recorded as eight stools in
24 h at 1 month, six stools at 6 months and five after
9 months [380]. Although it seems logical that frequency
would be directly related to gut transit, Goldberg et al.
[381] found no correlation. Instead, frequency was
directly related to pouch capacity. This would be consis-
tent with the finding that a W pouch appears to reduce
frequency compared with a J pouch [334].
Statement 6.7.
Well-selected patients have good continence after
pouch surgery; urgency and frequency improve with
time, but soiling may persist, especially at night.

Quality of life
Pouch surgery is essentially carried out to improve qual-
ity of life, but measuring quality of life in pouch
patients is difficult. Factors that impact on quality of life
include body image, especially scars and a stoma in par-
ticular, resulting in potential isolation and social com-
promise;
fear
of
an
operation
and
its
potential
complications, recurrence and malignancy; general ill
health from anaemia, malnutrition and lack of energy
and disturbed bowel function, especially incontinence,
which is usually worse with diarrhoea. Other factors
include sexual function, pain, mental health and the
complications of medication, especially steroids. Perhaps
a stoma and incontinence are the most feared complica-
tions of surgery for colitis.
Although there are numerous studies on quality of
life in patients with colitis undergoing ileoanal pouch
surgery, most are of moderate or low methodological
quality. A detailed systematic review suggested that only
3 of 33 studies identified could be considered high
quality [382]. Despite this, all studies supported the
observation that health-related quality of life and health
status improved in patients after pouch surgery and that
the levels reached those comparable with a healthy pop-
ulation. The authors point out several caveats which
mean that these results should be treated with caution
over and above the methodological weaknesses of the
meta-analysis. These include the fact that quality of life
may change with time.
Late postoperative complications
Small bowel obstruction. Small bowel obstruction is the
most common complication after an ileoanal pouch
with an incidence of up to 25% [342,343], with one-
quarter of these patients requiring reoperation. In most
cases the cause is adhesional [342,383] although rarer
causes
related
to
pouch
construction
have
been
described [358].
Stricture. Strictures at the pouch–anal anastomosis are
not uncommon, causing symptoms in 16% of patients
[358].
Symptoms
include
straining
and
incomplete
evacuation as well as watery stools and urgency. Often
the stricture is the consequence of previous anastomotic
complication (abscess or partial dehiscence) but Crohn’s
disease should be considered, particularly if the stricture
is proximal to the anastomosis. Soft and short strictures
may respond to simple dilatation, but more refractory
strictures require more complex procedures, ranging
from advancement flaps to pouch advancement (see
Section 13).
Fistula formation. This usually results from inadvertent
enterotomy during the pouch procedure but may also
arise from the pouch. Management is covered in Sec-
tion 13. Pouch–vaginal fistula is covered in Section 10.
Portal vein thrombosis. Patients undergoing a pouch
procedure are three times more likely than the general

 population to develop venous thrombosis and acquired
portal vein thrombosis is surprisingly common. Symp-
tomatic thrombosis occurs in about 6% of patients but
asymptomatic thrombosis may be as high as 40% [384–
387]. Symptoms range from nonspecific abdominal pain
to features of an acute abdomen. A high index of suspi-
cion should be maintained in those who fail to thrive
after discharge. CT is diagnostic and anticoagulation for
3–6 months usually resolves symptoms with no appar-
ent sequelae [384,387].
Pouch prolapse. Although rare, 83 cases of pouch pro-
lapse have been described [388]. Minor mucosal pro-
lapse can be treated conservatively with stool bulking
agents or local procedures [389]. Full-thickness pro-
lapse requires more invasive surgery and various pou-
chopexy procedures may be considered.
Cuffitis. Inflammation in the rectal cuff in the area
between the anastomosis and the dentate line is a
common cause of pouch dysfunction that may mimic
pouchitis. There are few published data on the diag-
nosis, management and prognosis of cuffitis, but it has
a similar presentation to colitis with bloody diarrhoea
and urgency. Biopsies from the cuff at endoscopy usu-
ally help to clinch the diagnosis. Cuffitis is a particular
risk
with
use
of
stapling
techniques,
and
ECCO
guidelines
suggest
that
the
maximum
length
of
anorectal mucosa between the dentate line and the
anastomosis should not exceed 2 cm [214]. Many of
those in whom the diagnosis is confirmed will respond
to topical 5-ASA or corticosteroids [390]. In those
with refractory cuffitis resulting in pouch failure many
have been found to have Crohn’s disease of the pouch
or surgical complications such as sinuses, fistulas or
strictures [390,391].
Pouch cancer. Pouch cancer has been described mainly
in case reports. A recent review of the literature [392]
identified 20 publications containing 26 cases in addi-
tion to their own. Almost all cancers were very early
stage and the mean time from pouch creation to adeno-
carcinoma was 8.9 years (see later for surveillance).
Pouch failure. Pouch failure is discussed in Section 13.
Pouchitis. Pouchitis
can
be
defined
as
nonspecific
inflammation in a nondiverted pouch in the absence of
local complications such as sepsis or anastomotic dehis-
cence. It is one of the commonest and more debilitat-
ing complications of an ileoanal pouch. The cause
remains elusive. Originally reported in continent ileos-
tomies
[393,394]
the
incidence
in
ileoanal
pouch
patients is reported to be between 7% and 42%, but
recent work assessing pouch patients up to 30 years
after the original procedure suggest the cumulative
probability may be as high as 80% [395].
The clinical symptoms of pouchitis include malaise,
rectal bleeding, diarrhoea and abdominal pain [396].
Added to this are the endoscopic findings of oedema,
contact bleeding/mucosal haemorrhage, granularity and
ulceration [397,398]. Biopsies are characterized by neu-
trophil infiltration and ulceration. Debate existed as to
what the best way of diagnosing pouchitis was, and a
number of systems have been proposed [397]. In 1994
the Pouch Disease Activity Index (PDAI) was devel-
oped, allowing quantification of the degree of pouchitis
[399]. It considers clinical, endoscopic and histological
parameters, and a diagnosis of pouchitis is made in any-
one with a score ≥ 7. This now allows various treatment
approaches to be more accurately compared. Despite its
widespread use, it may have limitations in some cases,
for example where there are focal areas of pouchitis,
found in 64% of patients [400,401].
Treatment options for pouchitis include antibiotic
therapy, anti-inflammatory/immunosuppressive agents,
novel therapies and, in a small proportion of patients,
excision of the pouch. The mainstay of antibiotic treat-
ment is metronidazole [402]. Most patients will have a
response within 24–48 h following administration of
750–1500 mg/day for 7–10 days. Those who develop
relapsing/remitting disease may require long-term treat-
ment with doses between 250 mg every third day to
250 mg three times a day [400]. Metronidazole has
been shown to be effective in active chronic pouchitis in
a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled cross-
over trial [403]. Alternatives to metronidazole include
ciprofloxacin, augmentin, erythromycin, tetracycline and
various combinations of the above, most commonly
metronidazole and ciprofloxacin [402,404].
In addition to antibiotics, anti-inflammatory and
immunosuppressive agents may be effective. Medica-
tions include steroid and mesalamine enemas, and oral
steroids, sulfasalazine and mesalamine [398]. Other
options include various forms of nutritional therapy
such as short-chain fatty acid enemas and oxygen free
radical scavengers such as allopurinol [404]. Pouchitis
has been shown to be associated with reduced counts of
both bifidobacteria and lactobacilli [405] and thus
attempts have been made to alter the balance between
anaerobic and aerobic bacteria within the pouch. The
polybiotic formula VSL#3 has been shown to be effec-
tive at maintaining remission from pouchitis in a ran-
domized double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [406].
The PDAI was significantly improved after antibiotic
and polybiotic supplementation.

 Other more recent therapies include the biologicals
infliximab [407] vedolizumab [408] and ustekinumab
[409] and granulocyte and monocyte apheresis [410].
There is also a multinational Phase III trial using the
ICAM-1 anti-sense oligonucleotide alicaforsen in pou-
chitis [411]. Other trials are under way to examine
interventions to prevent pouchitis.
Fertility/pregnancy and delivery in pouches
Ulcerative colitis is often associated with poor sexual
function. Several studies have demonstrated a postoper-
ative improvement in sexual function 1 year after IPAA
[412,413]. Conversely other studies have shown that
fecundity is significantly reduced when compared with
patients with ulcerative colitis managed medically or
with the normal population [414,415]. One study from
Finland showed that the probability of women with an
IPAA conceiving was reduced to 80% [416]. Others
have reported fecundity rates after IPAA as low as 20%
[414]. In view of these risks, alternative surgical options
such as subtotal colectomy and end ileostomy or ileo-
rectal anastomosis, if appropriate, should be discussed
with female patients (see Section 7).
Treatment of infertility may be successful in over
50% of patients [416]. Tubal adhesions are largely felt
to be the cause of the infertility postpouch surgery. A
laparoscopic approach is associated with fewer adhesions
and may result in better preservation of female fertility
and should be discussed [298,417]. Oocyte preservation
and assisted conception are also modern options avail-
able to patients after pouch surgery.
The question of whether a Caesarean section should
be recommended for all pouch patients is discussed in
Section 17.

In male patients, retrograde ejaculation and erectile
dysfunction are rare but may occur after IPAA. How-
ever, resecting the inflamed colon with surgery often
leads to an overall unchanged or even improved sexual
function. Sexual dysfunction may be avoided if an ileo-
rectal anastomosis is chosen, and this option should be
considered if appropriate.
Role of pouchoscopy
Pouchoscopy is perhaps the most important investiga-
tion in patients with pouch dysfunction, helping to dif-
ferentiate
between
pouchitis,
cuffitis
and
irritable
pouch. It also has a high diagnostic yield for other con-
ditions such as prepouch ileitis, Crohn’s disease or stric-
tures [418].
Regarding pouch surveillance for cancer there is little
consensus as to frequency or indeed need. The risk is
low and the ability to detect dysplasia during surveil-
lance is also low [419,420]. Surveillance pouchoscopy
with multiple biopsies from the pouch body and anal
transitional zone should be considered for those high-
risk patients who are most likely to develop dysplasia/
cancer, i.e. those with familial adenomatous polyposis
(FAP), primary sclerosing cholangitis, a previous history
of dysplasia or cancer in the original colectomy speci-
men, type C histological changes or a long retained rec-
tal
stump.
Annual
surveillance
in
these
groups
is
generally felt optimal but many experts no longer per-
form surveillance in other low-risk pouches [419].

many specialities including the provision of pouch sur-
gery [36] and management of pouch-related complica-
tions [422]. Although the ECCO guidelines go so far
as to recommend that pouch surgery should be per-
formed in high-volume specialist institutions [214],
such a statement may be too simplistic. Not all provi-

 ders get better results with additional caseload and
some ‘low-volume’ providers achieve excellent results.
Repatriating their cases to a high-volume centre with
mediocre results would clearly not be desirable [423].
In addition, it is not clear what constitutes a high-
volume centre. However, what is clear is that there are
several very low-volume centres in the UK doing < 1
pouch per year over the last 5 years [344]. These cen-
tres should be encouraged to transfer patients to the

Ileorectal anastomosis
The main aims of surgical treatment of ulcerative colitis
are to alleviate symptoms, minimize the risk of cancer and
avoid the need for immunosuppressive medication. In
addition, surgical treatment aims to achieve good func-
tional outcome and to be associated with a good quality
of life. Historically, the only option for patients with
ulcerative colitis who have failed medical treatment was
an ano-proctocolectomy with end ileostomy. In the late
1970s, surgeons described the procedure of restorative
proctocolectomy with an IPAA [328]. Such was the
research and development directed at this procedure that
by the late 1980s it had become the procedure of choice
for patients with ulcerative colitis with good long-term
functional results. Whilst this procedure may be the cur-
rent gold standard, it remains an operation of some mag-
nitude and carries risks, including anastomotic failure and
pelvic sepsis, the b^
ete noire of the pouch procedure. In
addition, up to 50% of patients will experience at least
one attack of pouchitis in the first 10 years postoperation
[395].
During the 1950s subtotal colectomy with ileorectal
anastomosis was considered to be an alternative to ano-
proctocolectomy for patients with colitis, and a number
of proponents of this procedure promoted it as a way
to avoid the only option of a permanent stoma [424].
Recently surgeons from several countries have favoured
the procedure for carefully selected ulcerative colitis
patients claiming several advantages over IPAA [425–
429]. Indeed, in Sweden during the period 2000–2010
ileorectal anastomosis for ulcerative colitis has become
just as common an operation as IPAA [430].
The procedure is less invasive, may result in satisfactory
function and avoids the need for pelvic dissection with the
associated risk of sexual dysfunction. Selection of appropri-
ate patients, both with ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s dis-
ease, is crucial. This selection, as well as description of
technique and outcomes are discussed below.
Indications for ileorectal anastomosis in ulcerative
colitis
Ulcerative colitis originates in the rectum and extends
proximally in a variable but continuous fashion. It
begins at the anorectal junction and the severity of dis-
ease appears to be higher distally, unless a fulminant
pan-colitis is present [431]. Rectal disease alone is
sometimes alleviated by topical medication and topical
medication will often improve rectal involvement to
render such rectal changes and symptoms minimal.
Patients with minimal rectal inflammation and those in
whom any inflammation is responsive to medical ther-
apy are candidates for an ileorectal anastomosis. They
should have no dysplastic change in the rectum or risk
factors for dysplasia (sclerosing cholangitis, previous or
family history of colorectal cancer). Due to this poten-
tial risk for dysplasia in a retained rectum, it is also
essential that patients are motivated enough to attend
for follow-up surveillance over many years [430]. An
exception to the dysplasia rule may be the patient with
colitis-associated
colorectal
cancer, with
or
without
metastatic disease, who is considered to have a short life
expectancy and may wish to avoid a stoma.
Good rectal compliance and capacity and normal anal
sphincter function are critical for good long-term out-
come. Anal function can be assessed by digital rectal
examination, but any concerns about the strength of
the anal sphincter are more accurately assessed by means
of anal manometry. Ileorectal anastomosis is contraindi-
cated in patients with a poorly distensible rectum, severe
rectal disease and poor anal sphincter function.
Another group that may benefit from an ileorectal anas-
tomosis are young patients who want to postpone pelvic
surgery. Ileorectal anastomosis avoids pelvic dissection and
thereby significantly reduces the risk of sexual and urinary
dysfunction associated with a panproctocolectomy or IPAA
[432–434]. In addition, there is substantial evidence to
suggest that fecundity is reduced after IPAA [435,436].
Conversely, in FAP patients, fecundity is unchanged after
an ileorectal anastomosis compared with the general popu-
lation [435]. The mechanism of this reduced fertility is
probably related to occlusion of the fallopian tubes by scar-
ring and adhesions [296]. It may be that, with laparoscopic
approaches to IPAA, this effect is reduced [298,417].
Nonetheless, current advice would be to consider ileorectal

 anastomosis, noting the above caveats, when treating
women of reproductive age who have not yet completed
their families.
Statement 7.1
Careful patient selection is essential if an ileorectal
anastomosis is to be considered for patients with
ulcerative colitis. Patients with minimal or controlled
rectal disease and reasonable rectal and anal sphinc-
ter function may be considered for ileorectal anasto-
mosis provided that there is low risk of dysplasia in
the retained rectum and that they are willing to
comply with postoperative surveillance.

Intervention
Many studies have demonstrated ileorectal anastomosis
for ulcerative colitis to be a safe procedure with low
morbidity and mortality. The literature would suggest
overall morbidity is in the range of 8–28% and mor-
tality between 0% and 4% [437]. Principal complica-
tions
include
small
bowel
obstruction,
anastomotic
leak and peritonitis. No data are available that would
suggest
sutured
anastomosis
is
superior
to
stapled
anastomosis, or vice versa. As long as an appropriate
technique is used the choice of method does not
appear to matter.
Regarding an open or laparoscopic approach for the
ileorectal
anastomosis
technique,
available
data
are
based principally on cohort studies for the colectomy
part of the procedure, reporting many outcomes in
favour of a laparoscopic approach [238]. The usual ben-
efits to laparoscopic over open surgery apply, i.e. shorter
in-hospital stay, shorter convalescence and less postop-
erative pain. Whilst operating times are typically slightly
longer
with
laparoscopic
procedures,
the
difference
these days is minimal and is unlikely to influence the
choice of approach. The choice of laparoscopic vs open
is a decision for patient and surgeon and depends on
the experience of the surgeon and the operating team
as well as individual patient factors, including body
habitus, previous incisions and operative procedures,
and general fitness.
Outcomes in patients with ulcerative colitis
Function
Most published series report frequency of bowel move-
ment between two and six times per day with an
instance of nocturnal seepage of around 5% and an
instance of urgency of defaecation of 20–25% [438].
About 25% of patients are on antidiarrhoeal medication
after follow-up of 10 years and the functional result
usually remains static from 1 year postprocedure [439].
Patients typically report improvement in quality of life
once they have recovered from the operative proce-
dure.
Medication
Patients with ulcerative colitis who have undergone ile-
orectal anastomosis have a high chance of requiring
medication to control rectal inflammation. Up to 90%
will require treatment, but this is often in the form of
topical 5-ASAs [425,428,429,440,441].
Failure
There is an estimated cumulative failure rate of around
10% at 5 years and 20% at 10 years [429]. Failure is
usually due to poor functional results with frequent
bowel
movements,
nocturnal
seepage,
day
time
urgency and incontinence is often due to flare up of
the proctitis which fails to respond to medication. An
advantage of ileorectal anastomosis is the possibility of
future conversion to an IPAA if failure occurs. Studies
suggest this occurs in up to 70% of patients with an
ileorectal anastomosis [429,438]. Little is known about
subsequent function in these ulcerative colitis patients,
but in FAP the function was no worse after a sec-
ondary procedure compared with the primary opera-
tion [442]. Of course, these data from FAP patients
cannot be completely extrapolated to patients with
ulcerative colitis as the risk of pouchitis will be higher
in this group.
Quality of life
Some data exist regarding quality of life after IPAA
compared with ileorectal anastomosis in patients with
FAP [443]. Despite better function after an ileorectal
anastomosis, quality of life was equal. In ulcerative coli-
tis one study suggests that quality of life is the same
after both procedures [438].

after

 Risk of dysplasia and cancer
Another reason for failure of ileorectal anastomosis is
the development of high-grade dysplasia or rectal cancer
in the retained rectum. Indeed the risk of cancer was
one of the reasons why ileorectal anastomosis was aban-
doned after colectomy for ulcerative colitis [444]. Dys-
plasia of the colorectal mucosa is associated with long-
standing ulcerative colitis. Whilst dysplasia in general is
considered to be an indication for surgery, it is impor-
tant to grade the dysplasia and to have the diagnosis
confirmed by more than one pathologist. The dysplastic
changes are often patchy, in which case the highest
degree of dysplasia should be considered. The rate of
dysplasia associated with the development of cancer in
patients with ulcerative colitis increases with time. The
literature can be difficult to interpret, but as a rough
rule of thumb, the overall cumulative probability of rec-
tal dysplasia and cancer in a retained rectum increases
from 9 and 2%, respectively, at 10 years to 25 and 14%
at 20 years [438].
Despite these data, several series have reported that
no patients have developed rectal cancer within 10 years
of diagnosis [426,427,429,438,444]. A possible expla-
nation for this finding relates to appropriate patient
selection. As mentioned above, ileorectal anastomosis
should not be carried out on those with risk factors for
dysplasia or who are unwilling to undergo surveillance.
In terms of surveillance, it is advised that rectal biop-
sies should be taken from multiple sites on an annual
basis from 8–10 years postoperation; if dysplasia is iden-
tified,
particularly
high–grade
dysplasia,
completion
proctectomy is indicated [445].
Statement 7.3.
With
appropriate
patient
selection
and
careful
surveillance, the risk of cancer in the rectum after
ileorectal anastomosis is around 2% at 10 years and
14% at 20 years.

Ileorectal anastomosis in Crohn’s disease
Traditional surgical management for refractory Crohn’s
colitis typically involves the creation of a temporary or
permanent stoma, and classically the procedure of choice
has been ano-proctocolectomy with permanent ileost-
omy. However, restorative procedures, which avoid the
use of a permanent stoma, are increasingly being used.
Whilst localized Crohn’s disease affecting the distal
ileum and right colon would be well served by a limited
ileocolic resection, in cases of colonic Crohn’s disease
with patchy involvement of the right colon and further
involvement of the transverse or left colon, but rectal
sparing, a subtotal colectomy with ileorectal anastomosis
is typically performed. The colectomy eliminates the risk
of recurrence of colonic disease and the ileorectal anasto-
mosis permits good function and quality of life. Around
80% will have a functioning ileorectal anastomosis 5 years
after surgery with an improved quality of life [427]. In
contrast, the recurrence of disease in the rectum at
10 years has been quoted at about 80% [292]. The pres-
ence of perianal sepsis and co-morbid pathologies is asso-
ciated with a reduced stoma-free survival [446].
As with subtotal colectomy and ileorectal anasto-
mosis for ulcerative colitis, it is important to assess
anal function preoperatively. Digital rectal examina-
tion with careful inspection of the perineum and
digital assessment of the anal sphincter should be
performed, and anal manometry should be carried
out if there are any concerns about the strength of
the anal sphincter. The compliance and capacity of
the rectum can be gauged by insufflation of air via
an anoscope, but ideally, direct physiological mea-
surement of rectal compliance and capacity will reas-
sure the surgeon and patient as to the suitability of
the rectum to maintain subsequent continence in
the presence of a good anal sphincter. A diseased
anorectum will compromise the chance of success
following ileorectal anastomosis and probably result
in a poor outcome and the likely conversion to
ileostomy.
In
such
cases,
ileorectal
anastomosis
should
be
avoided
and
a
permanent
ileostomy
should be considered [292,447]. A defunctioning
loop ileostomy should be considered in patients who
are
undernourished
or
immunosuppressed
due
to
their Crohn’s medication to avoid potentially catas-
trophic recurrence of anastomotic leak and subse-
quent sepsis.
Statement 7.4
Subtotal colectomy and ileorectal anastomosis is a

with rectal sparing and reasonable sphincter function
as it offers improved quality of life in the medium
term.

 Summary
Subtotal colectomy with ileorectal anastomosis is a rea-
sonable option to consider for patients with ulcerative
colitis or Crohn’s disease. For patients with ulcerative
colitis, it is a potential alternative for those who have
minimal disease in the rectum, no dysplasia or cancer,
women of reproductive age and in patients with good
anal
sphincter
function
and
rectal
compliance.
In
patients with Crohn’s colitis, this operation offers a
good surgical option for those with multiple areas of
colonic disease with rectal sparing and again good anal
sphincter function. Long-term management requires
medical input with regard to prophylactic medication to
minimize the risk of recurrence.
Finally, in both ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease,
care must be taken to ensure adequate surveillance of
the residual large bowel mucosa with flexible sigmoi-
doscopy and biopsies from multiple sites.
Continent ileostomy – the Kock pouch
The gold standard restorative procedure for ulcerative
colitis is construction of an ileal pouch with IPAA, first
described by Parks and Nicholls [328] and subsequently
popular with colorectal surgeons. Success with the
IPAA procedure is considerable and well established in
expert hands, with many patients enjoying good func-
tion and quality of life with a relatively low reoperation
rate
[345,448,449].
Nevertheless,
the
failure
rate
increases with time and is around 10–15% at 10–
15 years, septic complications and poor function being
the most common causes of failure [449–455].
In the event of failure, salvage pouch surgery with
re-do
IPAA
may
be
possible
in
a
proportion
of
patients with reasonable outcome, but many patients
end up as definitive failures with permanent diversion
or pouchectomy and end ileostomy [455–459]. Whilst
permanent diversion avoids the risks associated with
potentially difficult pouch excision, including bladder
or
sexual
dysfunction
and
a
nonhealing
perineal
wound [454,460], the morbidity of a loop ileostomy
coupled
with
the
risk
of
diversion
pouchitis
and
mucus accumulation or retention may be considerable,
or
at
least
inconvenient.
In
addition,
diversion
upstream of a pelvic pouch (sometimes a significant
distance proximally owing to mesenteric shortening)
may lead to considerable fluid, electrolyte and nutri-
tional deficiency.
Continent
ileostomy
was
first
reported
by
Nils
Kock in the 1960s in five patients [461]; it was
adapted from the technique for reservoirs constructed
for bladder substitution following cystectomy, and its
sustained success then built upon with certain modifi-
cations in 20 subsequent cases [462]. At a time when
end ileostomies had a poor reputation owing to high
complication rates, and before the advent of the ileoa-
nal pouch, the continent ileostomy gave patients con-
trol of stoma emptying, and was particularly popular
in
Scandinavia,
where
it
has
remained
so
despite
simultaneous widespread use of IPAA. Currently, con-
tinent ileostomy is rarely undertaken in the UK due
to the success and popularity of IPAA, which rapidly
displaced the Kock pouch in the 1970s and 1980s,
coupled with the perceived difficulties and high com-
plication
rates
associated
with
continent
ileostomy.
There is renewed interest in the UK for continent
ileostomy as an alternative to an IPAA, or as a salvage
option following IPAA failure.
Specialization
It is recommended that continent ileostomy surgery
should only be undertaken in specialist centres by sur-
geons specializing in IBD surgery and trained specifi-
cally in continent ileostomy surgery. Designated centres
should have stoma therapists trained in the management
of continent ileostomy.
Indications for continent ileostomy
Continent ileostomy may be undertaken for FAP or,
more unusually, following panproctocolectomy for can-
cer. Crohn’s patients with exclusively colonic or rectal
disease may also be considered, but must have demon-
strated a complete absence of small bowel disease at fol-
low-up. Ulcerative colitis remains the main pathology
for which continent ileostomy is undertaken, and the
main indications are:
• When IPAA is not an option
o Poor sphincters and incontinence
o Perianal sepsis and fistula
o Low rectal cancer when panproctocolectomy is
undertaken
• Salvage after failed IPAA
• Malfunction of conventional end ileostomy or psy-
chosocial maladjustment [463,464]
• Patient preference.
The starting point for the majority of patients when
considering continent ileostomy is likely to be an end
ileostomy, following subtotal colectomy with subse-
quent completion proctectomy, panproctocolectomy or
pouchectomy. In 423 continent ileostomy patients from
the Cleveland Clinic [465] the indications were:
• Conversion of end ileostomy to continent ileostomy
(59%)

ACPGBI IBD Surgery Consensus Collaboration
IBD Surgical Guidelines
 • Total proctocolectomy (20%)
• Conversion of failed IPAA to continent ileostomy
(16%)
• Completion proctectomy (5%).
Some series have reported an inferior outcome for
continent ileostomy patients who have an end ileostomy
for a period prior to continent ileostomy, compared
with those who go straight to continent ileostomy after
proctocolectomy, possibly owing to thickening of the
intestinal wall at the site which is to be used for the
nipple valve [466–468].
Contraindications to continent ileostomy
The only absolute contraindication to continent ileost-
omy in IBD is small bowel Crohn’s disease [469–471],
and patients with small bowel-sparing Crohn’s disease
must only be considered for continent ileostomy after
sufficiently long disease follow-up (at least 5 years) and
careful counselling. Kock reported a 27% complication
rate in Crohn’s patients having continent ileostomy
(twice that of patients with ulcerative colitis), and a
higher continent reservoir excision rate (16%) compared
with ulcerative colitis (2%) [472]. Whilst continent
ileostomy may be undertaken for FAP, desmoid disease
constitutes
a
relative
contraindication
to
continent
ileostomy in view of the tendency for desmoids to fol-
low surgical intervention.
For ulcerative colitis patients the following relative
contraindications should be considered:
• Obesity
o Technical difficulties of valve construction with
higher risk of valve slippage when there is excess
visceral fat
o Advancement of the efferent limb of the continent
ileostomy through the abdominal wall may be a
problem with visceral and subcutaneous obesity,
potentially creating intubation problems
• Perceived inability to intubate
o Insufficient
dexterity,
poor
eyesight,
mentally
unprepared
• Marginal small bowel length
o Particularly following excision of an unsalvageable
pelvic pouch (when around 50 cm is likely to be
resected)
o Around one-third of functional small bowel length
may be lost converting a J pouch to continent
ileostomy
o Around 50–70 cm of small bowel is required for a
Kock pouch and absorptive capacity is unknown
• Inability to accept the risk of complications and revi-
sion surgery [472].

Technical considerations
Around 50–70 cm of small intestine is required for the
construction of a low-pressure compliant Kock pouch,
and the technique has evolved and undergone a few
modifications since its first description [473]. Kock’s
original continent ileostomy did not have an intussus-
cepted valve; instead the efferent limb of the pouch was
relatively long as it passed through the abdominal wall,
the intention being for the rectus abdominus muscle to
act like a valve as it contracted [462,474,475]. Interest-
ingly, of Kock’s 29 patients without a nipple valve, 25
never required an ileostomy appliance [472]. The intus-
suscepted nipple valve was later added, although initially
fixed by suturing rather than stapling [462,475,476].
Various techniques have been described to improve
overall function, to halve valve slippage and revision
rates from around 40–50% and pouch excision rates
from around 10%, and to halve fistula rates from 16%
to 8% [477,478]. Most subsequent modifications have
been developed in an attempt to prevent valve slippage,
which remains the most troublesome complication.
Failure to fix the pouch adequately to the abdominal
wall may result in detachment and the start of pouch
problems [479,480]. There may be difficulty with intu-
bation, relative valve incompetence and a risk of pouch
torsion; detachment has been reported following blunt
abdominal trauma and adhesional traction from an
involuting postpartum uterus [479]. Detachment of the
continent ileostomy from the abdominal wall may be
partial or complete and may affect valve function; whilst

 radiological contrast examinations alone may overlook
reservoir detachment, such examinations can accurately

dysfunction

circumstances
[481]. Complete detachment may result in sliding her-
niation of the pouch and ultimately prolapse [39].
Pouch volvulus has also been reported [482].

Special considerations when converting a J pouch to
Kock pouch
Use of the original pelvic J pouch to construct a conti-
nent ileostomy may be possible in 10–25% of patients
with J-pouch failure [454,466,483–486]. This is likely
to be dependent upon the cause of pouch failure – sig-
nificant fistulating disease, pelvic sepsis or refractory
pouchitis are less likely to result in a successful conti-
nent ileostomy, and patients with an anatomically sound
pouch with unacceptable function may the most suit-
able. Wasmuth [486] reported more complications in
patients retaining the original pouch than in those hav-
ing a new continent ileostomy. In that series of 317
IPAAs over a 23-year period (1984–2007), pelvic pouch
failure occurred in 25 patients (7.8%). Seven underwent
continent ileostomy formation along with four tertiary
referrals. In all, seven had a continent ileostomy con-
structed from the J pouch and four had the original
pouch excised, with a Kock continent ileostomy in three
and a T pouch (see below) in one. In total, eight of the
eleven had fully continent pouches.
Lian et al. [485] presented a series from the Cleve-
land Clinic of 64 continent ileostomies after a failed pel-
vic pouch, in 16 of these the original pelvic pouch was
used for the continent ileostomy. The overall continent
ileostomy complication rate was 57.8% and the revision
rate 43.8%. Borjesson et al. [487] reported good results
using the pelvic pouch in all patients converted to a
Kock pouch; 8 of 13 patients with continent ileostomy
needed revisional surgery during a mean 6-year follow-
up period.
The surgical burden on patients with continent
ileostomy formed after failed IPAA seems no higher
than expected for continent ileostomy generally, and
the reported success rate is high [484–488].
For the technique of construction of a continent
ileostomy from an original pelvic pouch, the latter must
be extracted carefully from the pelvis [489], which can
be difficult in a hostile fibrosed pelvis, and damage to
the pouch may be unavoidable, in which case it should
be removed and a continent ileostomy constructed from
the remaining terminal ileum.
If the J pouch is to be retained, the afferent ileum is
divided 15 cm proximal to the pouch and the 15 cm
prepouch length used to construct the intussuscepting
valve and stoma, as described above, gaining access to
the inside of the pouch through the anal (outlet) end
of the pouch. This anal end of the pouch is then anas-
tomosed to the divided prepouch ileum [490]. The
continent ileostomy is then dealt with as described with
pouch fixation to the abdominal wall, and maturation
of the efferent limb and stoma.
Statement 8.4
In the event of pelvic pouch failure, conversion to a
Kock pouch may be considered after thorough
counselling.

Consensus: 87.9% (SA 42.4%, A 45.5%)
Use of proximal loop ileostomy
A proximal diverting loop ileostomy above a Kock pouch
is usually considered unnecessary, running the risk of a
high output and the attendant potential complications of
closure (Par Myrelid, personal communication). Besides,
for the patient who has opted for a continent stoma it
would be a little unexpected. Nevertheless, perhaps in
the case of difficult continent ileostomy revision, espe-
cially in the presence of fistulas or sepsis, or simply as a
wise precaution during initial adoption of continent
ileostomy surgery, a protecting loop ileostomy 15–
20 cm upstream of the pouch may be worth considering,
with the option of catheter placement into the pouch
through the efferent limb of the stoma for the purposes
of irrigation [491,492]. Use of a loop ileostomy has
been reported to reduce the overall complication rate
and valve slippage but this was a nonrandomized study
and should be interpreted with caution [493].

 experienced
in

with

pouch
patients
[490,494]. Patients should be warned that handling
and caring for the pouch may at first be more demand-
ing than having an ileostomy. Prolonged drainage of
the pouch in the early postoperative period seems to be
important in ensuring success [478,495].
The catheter should remain in place on free drainage
for 14 days, 24 h per day. This is to prevent obstruc-
tion and to avoid pouch distension. The catheter should
be flushed using the following regime (Eva Carlsson,
personal communication):
• First 24 h – flush every 4 h with 20–30 ml sterile sal-
ine
• After 24 h – flush every 6 h, and when needed, for
14 days
• After 3 days tap water may be used for flushing
• Check the catheter frequently once the patient starts
eating to ensure that it does not block
• If the catheter blocks, gently flush the catheter and, if
necessary, rotate or milk the catheter until it runs
freely.
Certain dietary restrictions should be followed. For
the first 14 days whilst the Medena catheter is in place
on free drainage a strict pureed ileum reservoir diet
should be consumed. Subsequently, whilst food need
not be pureed, care must be taken, patients must be
instructed to chew food well, and no raw food is
allowed.
After 14 days the patient is instructed in catheter
changes with the stoma care nurse and the following
regime is undertaken:
• Days 14–20 – the catheter is plugged during the day
and the plug removed every hour for flushing; during
the night it is connected to a drainage bag
• Days 21–27 – the plug is removed every 2 h and at
night is connected to a drainage bag
• Day 28, the catheter is removed completely
• During the fifth week the pouch is emptied every 3 h
and once at night, and should be flushed three to
four times a day depending on consistency of output.
Once the patient is confident in the use of the
Medena catheter he/she is discharged to outpatient fol-
low-up under close supervision of the stoma therapist,
and early review within 1 month with the surgeon is
arranged. It should be possible to place a simple swab
and adherent dressing over the stoma site between
catheterizations [494].

Alternative continent ileostomy constructions
Two main alternatives to the Kock pouch exist: the Bar-
nett continent ileal reservoir (BCIR) and the T pouch.
Neither of these pouches is commonly used but both
will be briefly described.
The unique feature of the BCIR is an isoperistaltic
valve, an intestinal collar and a lateral pouch design
[496–498]. Unfortunately, valve slippage still occurs
with the BCIR and, whilst good overall outcomes can
be achieved [499], the technique has not gained wide
popularity.
The T pouch, adapted from the technique of ortho-
topic
ileal
neobladder
reconstruction,
is
valveless,
thereby completely eliminating this complicated aspect
[490,500–502]. Re-operation rates are still in excess of
50% and these pouches are not commonly used.
Complications of continent ileostomy
In the short term surgical reservoir leakage occurs in
around 8%, from suture line dehiscence or potentially
from abdominal wall anchoring sutures [503], and the
most vulnerable site for leakage is probably the area
between the anterior suture line and valve.
Revisional surgery for longer-term complications is
common and occurs in up to 50% of continent ileost-
omy patients [455,465–468,477,485]. The major prob-
lems with Kock pouches are technical, especially related
to the nipple valve, particularly slippage, which is largely
responsible for the high reoperation rates. Despite the
high revisional rate, continent ileostomy pouch excision
rates at 10 years are reported to be < 10% [455,468],
similar or better than that reported for IPAA.
Management of complications
Valve dysfunction
The majority of problems with valve dysfunction are
seen in the first year postoperatively and patients gener-
ally do well after revision, with overall success rates of
50–70% [468,486].

Where
catheterization of the valve is difficult or impossible,
general anaesthesia with insertion of a Medena catheter
to
permit
drainage
may
be
necessary
in
the
first
instance, and an indwelling catheter may stabilize a
faulty valve in the short term. In the longer term surgi-
cal revision is required but overall salvage success is usu-
ally high [504].
Fistula
A fistula affecting a continent ileostomy may arise
from the pouch itself, usually from a leak at the
suture line, or from the region of the valve. Fistulas
arising from pouch leaks will usually present early and
may
be
manageable
by
catheter
drainage
alone
[495,505], although temporary upstream loop ileost-
omy may need to be considered. Crohn’s disease
should be excluded as this may be a cause of fistula
formation [506], as may use of mesh for valve rein-
forcement
[506–508].
Rarely,
perforation
of
the
pouch and fistula formation may occur as a result of
catheter
trauma.
Investigation
should
include
pou-
choscopy and cross-sectional imaging, including CT
and/or MRI. Fistulas arising from the valve are likely
to require revision surgery.
Stricture
Stricturing may occur at stoma level or at valve level,
most likely from ischaemia. Both problems are likely to
require revision surgery, although endoscopic stricturo-
tomy has been reported [509]. Prepouch stricture may
also occur, in a similar way to prepouch IPAA stricture,
and may respond to repeated balloon dilatation [253],
although revision surgery is ultimately likely.

Revisional surgery for continent ileostomy is fre-
quently required, mainly for nipple valve problems,
and must be undertaken in specialist centres by sur-
geons familiar with these problems.

Pouchitis
Pouchitis
(‘mucosal
enteritis’)
occurs
in
continent
ileostomy patients in a similar way to pouchitis in IPAA
and it is likely that a degree of stasis and bacterial over-
growth are also responsible [510]. The overall risk of
pouchitis in continent ileostomy is 13–43% [511,512].
Bacteriological
studies
of
continent
ileostomy
have
demonstrated
significant
bacterial
overgrowth
with
Gram-negative
and
anaerobic
flora
[511,513–515].
Multiple enteroliths in Kock pouches have also been
reported, probably resulting from the same mechanisms
and causing abdominal pain and altered pouch function,
but usually extractable by endoscopic means [516–518],
although laser lithotripsy has also been reported [519].
Symptoms of continent ileostomy pouchitis include
crampy abdominal pain, increased output, bloody dis-
charge and general malaise [510], with severe cases some-
times being associated with weight loss, fever and
arthralgia. A firm diagnosis of pouchitis should include
endoscopic and histological evidence of inflammation.
Treatment of continent ileostomy pouchitis is with
antibiotics, usually ciprofloxacin or metronidazole [520],
sometimes in rotation in persistent cases. Excision of con-
tinent ileostomy for refractory pouchitis is unusual [510].
Metabolic and nutritional factors
Whilst preservation of bowel length is important, and
must be considered particularly when converting a pel-
vic pouch to a continent ileostomy, intestinal failure
and malabsorption through short bowel syndrome are
unlikely to occur in continent ileostomy patients unless
significant complications with fistulas ensue or the need
for further resections arises [521,522].
Some continent ileostomy patients may have high-out-
put stomas (> 1000 ml/24 h) with accompanying loss of
electrolytes, nitrogen and fat and lower uptake of vitamin
B12 [477]. Whilst this may also be seen in some patients
with end ileostomies, it is possible that stasis with bacte-
rial overgrowth may be contributory, as well as reduction
in bowel length through repeated surgery. Treatment is
with oral electrolyte and glucose solutions, antidiar-
rhoeals such as loperamide, and proton pump inhibitors,
with antibiotics if bacterial overgrowth is suspected. Sig-
nificant metabolic disturbances do not seem to occur with
any greater frequency in continent ileostomy patients
compared with the normal population, including biliary
and urinary stones [523].
Imaging of complications and dysfunction
Acute complications, such as sepsis, anastomotic or
suture-line leaks, stomal ischaemia and intubation diffi-
culty, are likely to require a combination of imaging
modalities depending upon priorities, clinical suspicion
and imaging availability. Cross-sectional (CT or MRI)
imaging, for example, supplemented by water-soluble
contrast instillation of the pouch, is likely to be most sensi-
tive for the diagnosis of leaks, early fistulas and peri-pouch
collections. Early endoscopic examination of the stoma
and pouch may be indicated in the case of stomal

 ischaemia or infarction, but this should proceed with cau-
tion using a gastroscope and minimal insufflation (with
carbon dioxide) for fear of perforation. Careful endoscopic
examination may need to be undertaken under general
anaesthesia in the event of early difficulties with intuba-
tion.
For later pouch dysfunction occurring months or years
after construction, such as valve complications and pou-
chitis, a combination of imaging modalities will often be
indicated and usually complementary. Endoscopic assess-
ment allows direct visualization of the valve for intuba-
tion ease and presence of stricture, evidence of pouchitis
and the ability to take biopsies. Endoscopic access to the
afferent ileal limb may be difficult and a contrast radio-
logical pouchogram may be more useful, but radiology
may over-diagnose inflammation [524]. Carefully per-
formed and interpreted contrast radiology examinations
are capable of correctly diagnosing the nature of valve
malfunction in up to 96% of cases [525].
Whilst double-contrast barium examinations have
generally been superseded by cross-sectional imaging
and water-soluble contrast studies, large historical bar-
ium radiological studies provide a useful reference for
the understanding of Kock pouch anatomy and dysfunc-
tion [481,525]. These studies highlight the importance
of dynamic studies to diagnose valve eversion and slip-
page, for example use of the Valsalva manoeuvre and
removal of the catheter, whose presence may be artifi-
cially stabilizing a faulty valve [525]. In the future,
dynamic MRI may prove useful in this regard.
Long-term durability of continent ileostomy
Long-term durability and retention rates of 60–80%
over 10–25 years are recognized [455,466,467,478,
499,512,526,527]. In Kock’s series of 280 patients, of
228 patients with a nipple valve, 221 (97%) were conti-
nent [478]. Nessar et al.[467] reported 10- and 20-year
pouch survival rates of 87 and 77%, respectively, in a
series of 330 patients over a 27-year period. Such fig-
ures compare very favourably with the best IPAA
results. Successful retention of a continent ileostomy
depends upon the willingness of the patient and sur-
geon to embark on revision surgery, possibly many
times. Jarvinen et al. [512] reported an early series of
76 patients with a mean follow-up of 9 years; revisional
surgery was required in 49 patients (66%), mainly for
nipple valve failure, and good functional results were
ultimately attained in 62 (83%) patients. Litle et al.
[526] reported on the long-term follow-up (median
11.4 years) of 85 patients, of whom 60% retained a
functional pouch and had undergone up to four revi-
sions.
Some 41% underwent valve revisions within
6 months of pouch creation and 59% after 6 months.
Similarly, Lepisto and Jarvinen [466], during long-term
follow-up (mean 18 years) of 96 patients, reported
cumulative success rates of 96% at 1 year, 86% at
10 years, 77% at 15 years and 71% at 29 years. Some
85
re-reconstructions
were
performed
among
57
patients (59%), and of these patients 14 had pouch exci-
sion. The commonest reasons for pouch excision in
these series were recurrent valve dysfunction, fistulas,
Crohn’s disease and refractory pouchitis.
Quality of life with continent ileostomy
Good quality of life with a continent ileostomy is
reported in many series [466,499,512,526]. Patients
tend to be highly motivated to retain their continent
ileostomy and with it a satisfactory quality of life, even if
multiple revisions are necessary to achieve this. Specific
quality of life questionnaire assessment, comparing 68
continent ileostomy patients (median age 60 years at fol-
low-up) with a median follow-up of 31 years with a ran-
domly selected age-matched and gender-match sample
from the Swedish population, showed health-related
quality of life to be similar in the two groups [527], with
78% of continent ileostomy patients rating their overall
health as ‘good, very good or excellent’. The Cleveland
Clinic evaluated quality of life in 216 of 330 continent
ileostomy patients (in whom there was a mean number of
complications and pouch revisions of 3.7 and 2.9, respec-
tively) during a median follow-up of 11 years, using a
continent ileostomy surgery follow-up questionnaire and
the Cleveland Global Quality of Life scale [467]. Quality
of life measurements for patients with a retained conti-
nent ileostomy were higher on all scales in comparison
with patients who reverted to a Brooke ileostomy after
continent ileostomy excision. Working capacity and lei-
sure activities do not seem to be overtly affected by hav-
ing a continent ileostomy [499,523].

 surgeons and institutions would be advised to maintain
a database of patients to assess outcomes. As these
patients are generally well-informed motivated individu-
als, functional pouch problems in continent ileostomy
patients are likely to be reported promptly and the
means to enable this should be made available at special-
ist centres. In the absence of functional problems or sus-
pected pouchitis, endoscopic surveillance and mucosal
biopsy are probably unnecessary, as the risk of dysplasia
or cancer seems to be extremely low [466,521,528].
Summary
Continent ileostomy (Kock pouch) appears to be an
entirely valid option for patients with ulcerative colitis
and a small proportion of patients with colonic-only
Crohn’s disease. Overall success may be better in conti-
nent ileostomy performed as a primary construction from
an end ileostomy after proctocolectomy compared with
those undergoing conversion from an ileoanal pouch
after failure. There are unique technical considerations
which surgeons must master before undertaking conti-
nent ileostomy formation, and surgeons and patients
must be prepared to undergo continent ileostomy revi-
sion in order to deal with complications, in particular to
maintain integrity of the nipple valve. For this reason,
such surgery should only be undertaken in specialist cen-
tres with sufficient support from appropriately trained
specialist nurses. Long-term pouch durability rates and
quality of life seem to be high.
Surgery for perianal Crohn’s disease
Perianal manifestations of Crohn’s disease are common.
Up to one-third of patients will develop perianal pathology
including fistulas, fissures, anal skin tags and anorectal
stricture, ulceration or stenosis. In some cases, perianal dis-
ease is the initial presenting problem [529,530].
Surgical therapy essentially has dual roles. The pri-
mary role is treating sepsis whilst preventing tissue
destruction. This approach alleviates symptoms or at
least provides symptom control through drainage with
a view to long-term palliation. Alternatively, surgical
drainage may act as a bridge to further intervention
with medical or multimodal therapy. The second role
of the colorectal surgeon (which may be within the
context of multimodal therapy) is in offering interven-
tions aimed at definitive repair or fistula healing. While
the need for sepsis control with minimization of tissue
damage and consequent functional disturbance is abso-
lutely
essential,
the
chronic
relapsing
pattern
of
Crohn’s disease dictates that any subsequent surgery
should be tailored to the needs and goals of each
patient. Some patients may prefer symptom palliation
while others may desire definitive management with
attempt(s) at healing. It is paramount that the surgeon
focuses on an approach to management that is patient-
centred and directed [49].
Perianal fistula disease
Fistulating perianal Crohn’s disease may present with
perianal abscess, purulent or faecal discharge or inconti-
nence. The disease represents a significant challenge for
patients, physicians and surgeons. Despite perceived
advances in medical treatment, long-term disease con-
trol is achieved in about two-thirds of patients with sim-
ple fistulas and only one-third of patients with complex
disease [531]. There is little high-quality evidence for
the surgical interventions commonly used in this condi-
tion. The available ‘expert evidence’ suggests there are
no universally accepted treatment pathways/ algorithms
[532,533]. The resulting variable practice coupled with
the lack of high-quality evidence to guide best practice
probably contributes to the wide variation in rates of
disease control. The current trend for multimodal surgi-
cal and long-term, expensive medical therapy drives up
healthcare costs [534].
Management of perianal Crohn’s infection
The first surgical intervention for patients with perianal
Crohn’s fistulas is most commonly for drainage of an
acute abscess to provide control of sepsis. If fistulas are
readily identifiable, a ‘loose’ draining seton may be
placed. Fistula tracks should not be sought by an inex-
perienced or nonspecialist surgeon to avoid iatrogenic
secondary tracks; definitive procedures may be safely
deferred in favour of abscess drainage using small stab
wounds in the emergency setting.
Surgical treatment in this patient group is associated
with poor and delayed wound healing. The chronic
nature of the disease coupled with a potential for loose
stool consistency and frequent bowel function if there
is
associated
luminal
disease
means
that
sphincter
preservation is paramount. A conservative approach is
therefore advocated. A small proportion of fistulas may
also heal spontaneously
[535].
Certainly,
with the
above caveats there should be no attempt to lay open
the fistula. Although some argue that a very low fis-
tula, involving minimal or no muscle tissue, could be
laid open with minimal risk, others exercise caution,
particularly in the presence of proctitis where inconti-
nence can occur even after simple incision and drai-
nage
[536].

Subsequent management
Initial elective management
The goal of conservative management is effective symptom
control with insertion of draining setons at the first elective
procedure after abscess drainage [537,538]. There is no
evidence to guide which seton material is optimal. The
material used should be robust, nonallergenic and, above
all, comfortable to the patient, but otherwise may be at the
discretion of the operating surgeon.
Many surgeons would selectively utilize MRI in the
management of patients with perianal Crohn’s fistula
at this stage. Some prefer to obtain imaging to aid
localization of fistula openings and any residual sepsis
before
undertaking
an
elective
examination
under
anaesthetic. Other surgeons use MRI postoperatively
to assess resolution of fistula-related sepsis after place-
ment of setons [30]. Exclusion of residual sepsis is
important if subsequent medical therapy is to be initi-
ated and confidence that drainage is adequate must be
obtained clinically and/or radiologically before therapy
is started.

Medical management
Current best practice in management of perianal fistu-
lating disease uses both medical therapy and surgical
interventions to achieve fistula healing or alleviation of
symptoms [539–541]. There is increasing evidence that
this
multimodal
approach
using
draining
setons
followed by anti-TNFa and/or immunomodulators has
additional beneficial effects on symptoms (and possibly
healing) of perianal fistulas compared with surgery or
medical therapy alone (at least in the medium term).
For more details about medical treatment see the forth-
coming BSG guidelines.
When medical therapy is being considered, the sur-
geon’s role is to ensure satisfactory resolution of sepsis
and advise on the timing of seton removal. Fistulas
will not heal unless setons are removed, but optimal
timing of seton removal has not yet been established.
Whether this should occur before initiation of medical
therapy or after the first or second dose is not clear,
although the PISA (‘Multimodal treatment of perianal
fistulas
in
Crohn’s
disease:
seton
vs
anti-TNF
vs
advancement plasty’) trial may provide better evidence
on timing [82]. Most clinicians would remove just
before or soon after the second dose of infliximab at
around
2–6 weeks
after
initiation
of
treatment
[542,543]. There may be variations to this manage-
ment dependent on circumstances, none of which is
evidence based.
For instance, in the situation where multiple fistulas
are present, a programmed plan of seton removal may
be considered. In some patients, where palliation of fis-
tula symptoms is prioritized over healing, setons may be
left
in
situ
in
the
long
term.
A
multidisciplinary
approach to these decisions involving surgeon, physi-
cian, IBD specialist nurse and gastrointestinal radiolo-
gist and, most importantly, the patient is essential.

selling on success rates and the consequences of failure

 are perfect. Indeed, overall results may be considered at
best moderate. Outcome will depend upon various fac-
tors including complexity, severity and duration of dis-
ease, prior procedures, scarring, functional status of the
anorectum, smoking status and particularly whether
proctitis is present [49,544,545].
Whilst there are trials reporting outcomes of medical
therapy for this condition, there are no large RCTs
reporting on surgical therapies. This may be due to the
high degree of heterogeneity inherent in the disease.
This includes factors relating to disease course (pheno-
type of Crohn’s disease, mild or fulminant disease,
duration of disease), prior treatment factors (antibodies
to anti-TNF drugs, loss of response to treatment) and
fistula anatomy (simple vs complex, number of fistula
tracks, primary and secondary track behaviour). As all
these factors influence clinical decision-making; a well-
designed surgical trial would either need to stratify
recruitment across these factors or limit recruitment to
specific characteristics.
Whichever surgical option is selected, the underly-
ing basic dictum must be preservation of tissue, partic-
ularly sphincter muscle. Crohn’s patients have impaired
healing. Excision of perianal skin tags is largely con-
traindicated as it may lead to rapid deterioration in
symptoms (2) in the same way as radical lay-open
techniques may accentuate the disease process. If pre-
sent, a stricture may be gently dilated. Patients with
Crohn’s disease tend to have looser stool if luminal
disease is present or as a consequence of previous
intestinal resection. Even minor compromise in sphinc-
ter function may unmask symptoms of faecal inconti-
nence or urgency, making most specialist surgeons
reluctant to recommend any form of fistulotomy or
indeed cutting seton [546,547].
Statement 9.4

Surgical options
Seton drainage alone
Well-placed draining seton(s) often control disease and
are tolerated well by many patients. There is no ongo-
ing risk to continence if sepsis is controlled and poten-
tially no need for further surgery in nearly 90% of
patients in whom setons are the planned definitive strat-
egy [548]. The surgeon may recommend this as the
only option, but it is essentially palliation only and
residual discharge, seton discomfort and sexual embar-
rassment may prompt some patients into considering
treatment aimed at trying to heal the fistula(s).
A systematic review on the topic assessed outcomes of
studies comparing surgical monotherapy vs combined sur-
gical and medical therapy. This descriptive analysis found
that healing rates were approximately double in the multi-
modal group (55% vs 25%) (15). Details about optimiza-
tion of medical management of perianal Crohn’s disease
fistulas within the context of multimodal therapy are
detailed in the forthcoming BSG guidelines.

Fistula plug
The anal fistula plug has the advantage of minimal tissue
disruption, avoiding potential wound-healing issues and
theoretically continence issues. The most commonly used
plugs are Surgisis� (Cook Surgical Inc., Bloomington,
Indiana, USA), a bioabsorbable material made form por-
cine intestine, and the GORE� BIO-A plug (WL Gore &
Associates, Inc., Flagstaff, Arizona, USA), comprising
absorbable synthetic material. A recent meta-analysis
summarized the available data from 16 studies including
84 patients [549]. The total success rate, defined as clo-
sure of the fistula track, was 58% (95% CI: 47–69%).

 treatment (3/11, 27%), the numbers of these patients are
simply too small to come to any meaningful conclusion.
Indeed the quality of the data is so poor, due to lack of
standardization and heterogeneity, missing data regard-
ing prognostic indicators (e.g. proctitis, severe complex
disease), small numbers in individual studies, variable but
often short follow-up and lack of data on reason for fail-
ure (whether technical or disease related), that it is very
difficult to recommend the plug based upon reported
success. The meta-analysis did not include the results of a
multicentre open-label RCT where some attempt was
made to stratify patients [550]. In this study 54 Crohn’s
patients had an anal fistula plug; fistula closure at
12 weeks was achieved in 31.5%. The closure rate was
similar to that achieved with seton removal alone (relative
risk 1.31, 95% CI: 0.59–4.02, P = 0.19). The complexity
of the track did not seem to influence success. It is disap-
pointing that this trial was carried out without the use of
biological therapy, as multimodal therapy would be con-
sidered the current best practice standard.
Statement 9.7.
There is weak evidence to support anal fistula plug
as a low-risk option in simple perianal Crohn’s fistu-
las where successful healing may be achieved in a
small proportion of fistulas. There is a risk of post-
procedure sepsis, but long-term functional conse-
quences are unlikely.
Level of evidence: II
Grade of recommendation: C
Consensus: 87.5% (SA 25.0%, A 62.5%)
Despite poor data quality and the negative result of a
RCT, there appear to be some successes with the fistula
plug and the minimally invasive nature of the interven-
tion make it a viable part of the surgical armamentarium
[30,49].
Ligation of the intersphincteric track (LIFT) procedure
Although the LIFT procedure purportedly preserves the
anal sphincters it does involve a significant amount of
tissue division and a degree of sphincter retraction,
firstly to gain access to the fistula in the intersphincteric
space and subsequently in coring out the component of
the track external to the external sphincter.
There are few data specifically on use of LIFT in
Crohn’s disease. One prospective study published in
2014 reported outcomes of 15 LIFT procedures for
Crohn’s fistulas [551]. The procedure was successful in
nine cases at very short-term (2-month) follow-up. At
12-month follow-up, one repair had failed and three
patients had developed a new fistula, meaning that just
one-third of patients remained healed. Four patients
with trans-sphincteric perianal Crohn’s fistulas were
reportedly successfully treated in the short term with
LIFT procedures reinforced with bioprosthetic mesh in
the intersphincteric space [552].
Clearly there are only a small number of patients
described in the literature and the long-term results are
unknown. There are currently insufficient data to rec-
ommend or dismiss this technique.
Statement 9.8.
At present there is insufficient evidence for the use
of the LIFT procedure in the treatment of perianal
Crohn’s fistula.

Advancement flap
Endoanal advancement flaps in perianal Crohn’s disease
have been described in several studies. The literature was
summarized in a review published in 2010 [553].
Although the weighted success of 64% seems very
promising, the authors point out the limited quality of
the reports with numerous structural and design flaws. In
addition, they report an incontinence rate of 9.4%. Nev-
ertheless, the advancement flap was chosen as the most
appropriate surgical comparator in an ongoing trial of
multimodal treatment of perianal Crohn’s disease [82].
Scarring, fibrosis and guttering deformities from pre-
vious surgery may all predicate against the use of advance-
ment flaps in many patients with chronic perianal
Crohn’s fistulas. It should be noted that the endoanal
advancement flap is relatively contraindicated in patients
with proctitis due to poor wound healing and high recur-
rence [554,555]. Ano-cutaneous flaps may be an alterna-
tive in this situation but have not been assessed.
Statement 9.9.
Although there is some evidence for use of an
advancement flap as a means of closure for perianal
Crohn’s fistula in the absence of stricture or procti-
tis, there is a high failure rate and associated risk to
continence.

 obstruction of the fistula track. One randomized trial ini-
tially reported favourable results with the technique over
observation in perianal Crohn’s fistulas [556]. At 8 weeks,
the primary end-point of fistula closure was seen in 38% of
the fibrin group compared with 16% of the observation
group (OR 3.2, 95% CI: 1.1–98, P = 0.04). The same
group reported on 14 patients with refractory fistulating
Crohn’s disease undergoing fibrin glue treatment. This
study found clinical improvement in 75% of patients at
3 months’ follow-up and complete healing in 57% of
patients at 2 years [557]. Subsequent trials of fibrin glue in
the cryptoglandular setting have suggested poor results,
and the technique has largely fallen out of favour
[558,559].
The limited data from a single centre do not justify
its use in perianal Crohn’s fistulas although combination
with other biomaterials, such as adipose-derived stem
cells, allograft acellular dermal matrix and xenograft col-
lagen, requires further investigation (see below).

Novel therapies
Hybrid techniques
The bioLIFT technique combines the LIFT procedure
with insertion of a bioprosthetic graft in the inter-
sphincteric plane, but only a very small case series has
been reported (36). The LIFT-plug technique has also
been described but not reported in patients with peri-
anal Crohn’s fistulas [552].
Permacol
TM paste injection has been combined with
advancement flap in seven patients with IBD-related fis-
tulas [560]. Healing rates were 57% (4/7) after a med-
ian of 14 months’ follow-up.
Biomaterials
Biomaterials include autografts (adipose-derived stem
cells, platelet-rich plasma), allografts (acellular dermal
matrix)
and
xenografts
(Permacol
injection)
[561].
These techniques may be promising in that they cause
minimal tissue disruption. Most have not been tested in
the field of perianal Crohn’s disease. However, there is
recent randomized trial evidence for autologous stem
cells
which
is
particularly
promising.
The
surgical
procedure involves curettage of the track, correct loca-
tion of the injection and sutured closure of the internal
opening of the fistula(s). A large multicentre trial sug-
gested that a greater proportion of patients treated with
allogenic
adipose-derived
mesenchymal
stem
cells
(Cx601) attained combined remission compared with
placebo injection [intention to treat 53/107 (51%) vs

lowing placebo injection could perhaps reflect the surgi-
cal technique incorporating sutured closure of internal
openings of fistulas.
Other techniques
The over the scope clip (OTSC�, Ovesco
TM) refers to
application of a metal alloy clip to a fistula opening.
The technology has been used in flexible endoscopy
and has recently been adapted for application with peri-
anal fistula via a specific delivery mechanism. There is a
single report on the use of this technique in ten anal fis-
tula patients, six of whom had Crohn’s disease. Treat-
ment was successful in five patients with a follow-up
period ranging from 157 to 523 days [562].
Fistula track laser closure (FiLAC) is a sphincter-pre-
serving technique that uses a diode laser source and
radial emitting laser probe (FiLAC
TM, Biolitec, Vienna,
Germany) that works by destroying the lining of the
track and shrinking the tissue around the probe [563].
No data exist for use of the treatment in perianal
Crohn’s disease.
Video-assisted anal fistula treatment (VAAFT) utilizes
a fistuloscope, unipolar electrode and endobrush and
glue to fulgurate, curette and seal the track [564]. The
internal opening must be closed. Again, no data currently
exist for the treatment of perianal Crohn’s fistulas.
While these advanced technologies have a sound the-
oretical basis all are in an early stage of evolution, and
although some early results are promising they are diffi-
cult to reproduce. Longer follow-up and further evi-
dence is required before any of these techniques can be
recommended.

Management of the failed perineum
Pain, pads and incontinence define the failing bottom
with significant negative impact on quality of life. There
may be a point when the patient reaches the decision
that medical or surgical therapy is not going to help.
The surgeon can only guide the patient to this conclu-
sion by being realistic in terms of what can be offered
[94]. A temporizing intervention is to defunction the
bowel. Diversion in a patient with severe symptomatic
perianal Crohn’s is often associated with a significant
improvement in quality of life [565]. The choice of
stoma type should be individualized based upon the
pattern of disease and patient preference. Whilst a loop
ileostomy is more commonly utilized [566], isolated
proctitis or perianal disease may be more effectively
defunctioned with a colostomy. This may make a subse-
quent proctectomy technically easier.
It is important for the patient to realize that a divert-
ing stoma in this situation is highly likely to be perma-
nent, with just 10% of patients returning to long-term
intestinal continuity. As such, for most patients, diver-
sion may simply be a stepping stone to subsequent
proctectomy [567].
Diversion does not always provide adequate symp-
tom control or improvement in quality of life in severe
perianal Crohn’s disease, and proctectomy or procto-
colectomy should be considered (see Section 5), with
patients expressing the desire to see clinicians raise this
option earlier in their treatment pathway [94].
Proctectomy in the setting of perianal Crohn’s dis-
ease is associated with poor healing in up to 40% of
patients [568]. This may result in a simple chronic
perianal sinus with occasional discharge with a spec-
trum of outcomes to the other extreme of severe non-
healing perineum with persistent discharge rivalling
that experienced before proctectomy. Reconstruction
with myocutaneous flaps should be considered in par-
ticularly bad cases of disease. Vertical and transverse
rectus abdominis [569], gluteal [570] or gracilis [571]
myocutaneous flaps have been described in this set-
ting.

Other manifestations of perianal Crohn’s disease
Skin tags
Profuse and atypical skin tags can be pathognomic of
perianal Crohn’s disease. They are associated with peri-
anal lymphoedema [572] or fibrosis. Patients may request
excision due to symptoms of swelling, induration, irrita-
tion or difficulty in perineal hygiene. However, conserva-
tive management is key as excision frequently leads to
deterioration in symptoms from poor healing and may
precipitate need for more aggressive surgery [529].
Fissures
A Crohn’s fissure, unlike idiopathic fissures that tend to
lie in the posterior or occasionally anterior midline, may
occur at any position on the anal circumference. Some-
times the atypical location of a fissure in itself raises the
suspicion of the underlying diagnosis of Crohn’s dis-
ease. Crohn’s fissures tend to be painless and may occur
in combination with other perianal manifestations of
Crohn’s disease. It may be difficult to differentiate a
true high-pressure fissure from an anal ulcer.
As with all perianal Crohn’s disease, treatment of a
true high-pressure fissure should be conservative with
topical therapies (GTN, diltiazem gel or ointment) and
botulinum toxin injection being used in preference to
surgical sphincterotomy [529].
Anal stricture
Anal and low rectal strictures are not uncommon in
Crohn’s disease, occurring in about 10% of patients
with perianal disease [573], especially in patients with
proctitis or chronic perianal sepsis relating to fistulating
disease. Diagnosis is readily made on digital rectal or
proctoscopic examination and often treatment is not

 required as the stricture is asymptomatic. It is quite sur-
prising how patients may tolerate severe stenosis. If
symptoms develop in the form of obstructed defaeca-
tion, then simple dilatation is often effective but may
occasionally be accompanied by poor wound healing
[574]. Refractory cases usually require proctectomy as a
stoma often exacerbates symptoms of stenosis [575].
Haemorrhoids
As haemorrhoids occur commonly in the general popula-
tion it is no surprise that they also occur in patients with
perianal Crohn’s. Indeed, symptoms from haemorrhoids
may be exacerbated by frequent call to stool. Treatment
is conservative due to poor healing. Haemorrhoidectomy
should be avoided unless absolutely necessary and only
ever offered in the absence of proctitis [575]. Rubber
band ligation is recommended as a treatment by the
American Gastroenterology Association [576] and Dop-
pler-guided haemorrhoidal artery ligation may be suc-
cessful without compromising wound healing [577].
Anal ulceration
This is an unusual but dramatic presentation. An abscess
should be excluded. Treatment is then medical, with
the primary objective of symptom relief, and steroid
injection or topical tacrolimus may help [578]. Occa-
sionally, especially in children, a severe variant of anal
ulceration ‘highly destructive perianal Crohn’s’ [579]
may be observed. Medical management in the form of
immunomodulation is the mainstay of treatment. Severe
cases may benefit from defunctioning stoma.
Rectovaginal and pouch–vaginal fistula
Perineal involvement in Crohn’s disease is relatively
common, with rectovaginal fistulata (RVF) occurring in
5–10% [127,580,581]. Indeed after obstetric trauma,
Crohn’s disease is the commonest cause of vaginal fistu-
lation [582]. The likelihood of developing a fistula is
related to the presence and severity of left-sided col-
orectal
Crohn’s
involvement
[583];
only
3.5%
of
patients with small bowel disease will have fistulation
compared with 23% of those with large bowel involve-
ment [582]. The presence of RVF significantly increases
the lifetime risk of a stoma or proctectomy [584].
Presentation and assessment
Rectovaginal and pouch–vaginal fistulas usually present
with leakage of gas, liquid or faeces through the vagina, as
well as pain or discomfort and a purulent discharge. In
addition, there may be dyspareunia, perineal pain or
tenderness and avoidance of sexual intercourse [127,581].
Fistulas are classified according to the relationship with the
anal sphincter; ano-vaginal fistulas where the intestinal
internal opening is in the anus and rectovaginal when it is
within the rectum, with the former often having a more
benign clinical course [585]. These terms are often used
interchangeably in the literature.
Clinical examination may reveal the presence of anal
or rectal disease with inflammation or the presence of a
stricture. Vaginal examination may show a fistula open-
ing or induration in the posterior vaginal wall. The
internal and external openings of any fistula may be dif-
ficult to find clinically, and where clinical suspicion is
high but initial examination is unhelpful an examination
under anaesthetic is advised and usually combined with
specialized imaging.
Magnetic resonance imaging can clearly show peri-
anal sepsis but may not be helpful in RVF [529],
although the use of endocoil MRI improves accuracy
[586]. Abdominal cross-sectional imaging is often help-
ful in assessing concurrent small bowel disease, and
luminal assessment with colonoscopy is vital to assess
the total inflammatory burden. Anal ultrasound (with
or without hydrogen peroxide enhancement) may also
be useful [587,588] and may also provide vital anatomi-
cal information regarding integrity of the anal sphincter
[589]. Transperineal ultrasound may be a promising
alternative [590].
In keeping with the general principles of anal fistula
management, treatment should be a staged process with
initial steps of drainage of sepsis and control of the pri-
mary track [582,583] prior to attempted definitive
treatment.
Statement 10.1
A combination of careful examination under anaes-
thesia by an experienced surgeon and perineal MRI
is useful in the diagnosis and assessment of clinically

Medical management
Whilst the control of any underlying Crohn’s disease
may be vital to the success of any surgical treatment for
fistulas to the vagina, medical management may in itself
lead to fistula healing. Many reports have been pub-
lished suggesting concurrent medical therapy to supple-
ment surgical treatment.

 Antibiotics
There are no randomized studies investigating the use
of antibiotics in the healing of RVF and so the evi-
dence to date is largely anecdotal and relates to case
series [581,591]. There may be some short-term bene-
fit in the reduction of symptoms. Brandt et al. [592]
treated 26 patients with oral metronidazole, achieving
healing in under half at the expense of neurological
symptoms with prolonged use. Similarly, the use of
ciprofloxacin, in combination with metronidazole or
azathioprine, may be beneficial for symptom reduction
[582,593,594].
Corticosteroids
There is no evidence on the role of steroids specifically
for the treatment of RVF and pouch–vaginal fistulas in
Crohn’s disease.
Cyclosporine/tacrolimus
Whilst intravenous cyclosporine has been shown to
induce healing in Crohn’s anal fistulas in one study
(88% after a mean of 7.4 days), two RVFs in this study
rapidly recurred after conversion to oral medication
(19). Similar poor results have been reported by others
[127,595].
6-mercaptopurine (6-MP)/azathioprine
The immunosuppressive agent 6-MP and its metabolite
azathioprine have been used to attempt healing in anal
fistulas including a small RVF subgroup. One-third of
this subgroup healed in a randomized controlled study
comparing 6-MP with placebo [596]. Healing took a
mean of 3.1 months and often longer, with most
relapsing after cessation of treatment.
Infliximab
The advent of anti-TNF treatment has markedly chan-
ged the treatment of Crohn’s disease, particularly in the
treatment of fistulas [597]. Whilst most attention has
been directed at intestinal and anal fistulas, no studies
specifically address RVFs. The best evidence comes from
subgroup analysis of the ACCENT II study [598].
Those patients who responded to the three initial
induction doses were randomized to continue with
treatment or receive placebo. RVF closure was preserved
for longer in the treatment group and those who ini-
tially responded to induction and received ongoing
maintenance treatment thereafter had a 44% chance of
maintaining healing. For this reason, many advocate the
use of anti-TNF treatment to reduce active anorectal
inflammation prior to considering RVF repair [581].
However, evidence that surgical success is increased fol-
lowing biological therapy is lacking [599–601].

Surgical treatment
Initial treatment for RVF should always be drainage of
any sepsis and control of the primary track with a seton
only if infection is present [602]. Following drainage,
attempts should be made to optimize local anal and/or
rectal inflammation.
The original standard surgical treatment for difficult,
symptomatic RVF traversing a large portion or the entire
anterior sphincter complex was always proctectomy or
permanent diversion with a stoma. Modern management
has led to a more sphincter-preserving approach with
the use of trans-vaginal or trans-rectal flaps, advance-
ment rectal sleeves or a trans-perineal approach, as well
as the application of techniques used in idiopathic anal
fistula treatment, namely fistula plugs and collagen paste
or tissue interposition (gracilis and Martius flaps). The
ultimate choice of approach depends on the exact loca-
tion of the fistula and the concurrent condition of the
anus, rectum and sphincter complex [603]. Often more
than one surgical option may be needed to heal a fistula
[604]. Overall for Crohn’s RVF healing rates of up to
67% have been reported in experienced specialized units.
It may take up to 48 months and a mean of 1.4 opera-
tions to achieve success [599,605,606] and is probably
dependent on factors such as the concurrent use of
immunomodulators with failure associated with the use
of steroids and smoking [607].

Rectal advancement flaps
This technique involves the creation of a broad-based flap
involving mucosa, submucosa and circular muscle of the
rectum. The fistula track is identified, excised or curetted
and the internal opening closed with absorbable sutures.
The mobilized flap is then secured over the closed open-
ing distal to it to cover the site of the previous fistula. The
vaginal opening is usually left open to drain freely to avoid
a collection in the rectovaginal space [582]. The attraction
of this technique is that the flap is covering the track from
a high-pressure area (rectum) to a lower-pressure area
(vagina) with the introduction of normal interposing tis-
sue [608]. This approach is contraindicated in cases with
active rectal disease, extensive ulceration or strictures.
Vaginal advancement flaps
These have the advantage of using nondiseased pliant
vaginal tissue, avoiding excessive handling of the rectal
mucosa, which is particularly important if there is any
residual inflammation present [609]. Cure rates using
this approach have been reported to be as high as 92%
[609], especially when levator muscle is interposed
between the repaired rectum and the vagina [610]. A
more realistic success rate is around 40–60% [603,611–
615], with success rates independent of the use of a
defunctioning stoma.
A recent systematic review comparing treatment with
advancement flaps for Crohn’s-related RVF found no
difference in primary closure, overall closure or recurrence
rates between either the rectal or vaginal approach [616].
A total of 11 observational studies were assessed giving a
pooled rate of closure of 54% with the rectal approach
and 69% with a vaginal flap. Irrespective of healing, sexual
function and quality of life scores are comparable before
and after healing [607], although rates of dyspareunia
may be slightly higher in those women who do not heal.

Fistula sealing techniques
The general mantra for modern surgical treatment for
anal fistulas is that of sphincter conservation. This is
especially true for RVF where sphincterotomy would
often necessitate cutting the majority of the length of
the anal sphincter leaving a wide wound which may heal
badly. Due to these factors, fibrin glue and latterly col-
lagen fistula plugs have been used to try to heal tracks.
Most studies combine the results of treatment for cryp-
togenic fistulas and those related to Crohn’s disease,
with success rates for fibrin glue ranging from 14% to
69% [550,581]. A systematic review showed a closure
rate of 55% using fistula plugs in Crohn’s-related anal
fistulas, although RVFs were excluded from this analysis
[617]. Gajsek et al. reviewed the long-term results of
the button fistula plug in the treatment of RVF related
to Crohn’s disease and pouch–vaginal fistulas. They
found that at 2 years no pouch–vaginal fistulas and 44%
of RVFs had healed [618]. Furthermore, all attempts at
repeated plug insertion failed. Other groups have had
some success in both RVFs and pouch–vaginal fistulas
with the button plug, with 60–66% [619] healing in
RVFs and 57% healing in pouch fistulas in the short
term (15 weeks) [620]. In a similar way repeat insertion
led to only a 12.5% success rate.

 Gracilis muscle interposition/Martius graft
The interposition of healthy tissue into a fistula track or
reinforcing a fistula repair has been employed either
with a labial fat pad flap graft (modified Martius) or a
muscle flap (gracilis). In a study of gracilis muscle inter-
position 33% of nine patients with Crohn’s vaginal fistu-
las healed [621], although with a 29–47% complication
rate [622]. In a recent systematic review of gracilis graft
for complex perineal fistulas the success rate in the
Crohn’s subgroup was 54% [623], although success
rates of up to 92% at 3.4 years have been reported
[624]. By contrast Martius graft had a success rate of

Rectal sleeve reconstruction
A sleeve flap may provide a better option in those
patients
with
low-circumferential
rectal
disease
but
normal mucosa proximally, and good continence. The
procedure involves resection of all diseased mucosa
allowing anastomosis with normal rectal mucosa to
the ‘neo-dentate’ line. There are limited reports of
this technique (Soave procedure), the largest series
being in 13 patients [627], 11 of whom had RVF.
Eight patients were healed at 1 year. Other groups
have had success in highly selected cases where RVF
coexists with a rectal stricture [628]. An alternative to
a purely perineal approach is to mobilize the rectum
from the abdomen, resecting the diseased segment.
After performing an anal mucosectomy from below
and closing the fistula, the healthy bowel is advanced
to form a colo-anal anastomosis [580]. This anasto-
mosis may be created immediately or with delayed
maturation after 5–6 days (Turnbull–Cutait technique)
[629].
Stem cells
Abdominal wall fat has been harvested and injected into
RVF tracks; this has been successful in a limited number
of patients when the fistula is related to obstetric injury,
but when used in Crohn’s disease all fistulas recurred
[630]. Studies have reported using stem cell injection
from
autologous
fat
harvesting
with
some
success
[631]. A Phase II study in 10 women has shown that
using autologous fat-derived stem cells, 60% of RVFs
are healed at 52 weeks [632].
Diversion stoma and proctectomy
Many patients with Crohn’s RVF will be diverted dur-
ing the course of treatment as an adjunct to healing, as
a means of alleviating symptoms or to salvage complica-
tions of interventions aimed at healing.
The ultimate treatment for recurrent anal fistulation
or RVF in Crohn’s disease is proctectomy. Up to 20%
of patients are ultimately treated this way [633]. The
procedure is not without complication, with nonhealing
perineal wounds occurring in between 30% and 50%
[608,634] (see Section 13).

Summary
Rectovaginal and pouch vaginal fistulas are relatively
common complications of Crohn’s disease and ileoanal
pouch formation (occurring in up to 10% of cases). When
present they significantly reduce quality of life. Often a
multidisciplinary approach to treatment is needed to opti-
mize any underlying IBD and drain any sepsis. Following
this a variety of strategies may be used depending upon
the exact presentation. Multiple attempts at surgery are
usually required before successful healing, with no surgi-
cal approach having superior results.
Duodenal Crohn’s disease
Duodenal Crohn’s disease is defined using criteria pro-
posed by Nugent and Roy [644]. In the presence of
one of the two following criteria the diagnosis of duo-
denal Crohn’s disease can be made: (i) the histological
presence of noncaseating granuloma or granulomatous
inflammation with or without obvious Crohn’s disease
elsewhere in the intestinal track, and without evidence
of systemic granulomatous disorder; or (ii) documented
Crohn’s disease elsewhere in the intestinal track and
radiological
and/or
endoscopic
findings
of
diffuse
inflammatory change in the upper gastrointestinal track
consistent with Crohn’s disease. Duodenal manifesta-
tions are not always primary and can be secondary. In
situations
where
surgery
is
needed
for
duodenal
Crohn’s disease the indications are usually related to
duodenal involvement from adjacent organs such as the
terminal ileum and colon.
Strict adherence to diagnostic criteria as described
above gives estimates of the prevalence of duodenal
Crohn’s disease of between 1.8% and 4.5% [644,645].
This usually relates to symptomatic disease, but the true
incidence and prevalence of duodenal Crohn’s disease
may be underestimated. Many of these data originate
from studies on patients with long-standing Crohn’s dis-
ease who are already on immunosuppression. As the risk
of duodenal Crohn’s disease is much higher in the paedi-
atric population it is standard practice to perform upper
gastrointestinal investigations to assess this part of the
gastrointestinal track, but the true incidence of duodenal
lesions in adult-onset Crohn’s disease is less well known
[646]. Horje and colleagues have attempted to identify
this risk in a single-centre cohort and estimated that up
to 55% of patients with newly diagnosed Crohn’s disease
have some upper gastrointestinal manifestation but they
may not always be symptomatic [647]. Focal duodenal
inflammation can be seen in over 50% of patients with
Crohn’s disease even in the absence of Helicobacter pylori
[648,649]. It is assumed that the treatments given to
suppress the inflammation in the other organs reduce
the inflammatory burden in the upper gastrointestinal
track, leading to a lower prevalence. It is reasonable to
speculate that this may be the reason for the low surgical
burden of duodenal Crohn’s disease.
There have been isolated reports of primary fistulat-
ing disease of the duodenum [650–654]. Fistulating
disease involving the duodenum is more commonly
associated with disease in the colon or ileum directly
invading the duodenum [655]. One of the more com-
mon scenarios in which a fistula to the duodenum
occurs is in the presence of an ileocolic anastomosis
placed adjacent to the duodenum, but ileal or colonic
disease can also directly fistulate into the second part of
the duodenum. The primary management strategy in
this situation is to treat the source of the fistula and will
involve resecting the affected segment of the bowel.
Repair of the duodenum can be performed primarily if
the defect is small. In the event of a large defect the
options are an omental patch, a serosal patch involving
a segment of jejunum or a duodenojejunostomy. The
advantage of a jejunal serosal patch is that in the event
of subsequent perforation, the duodenal contents will

 most likely drain to the attached jejunum, causing no
metabolic consequences to the patient. It is important
to ensure that any jejunum used for a serosal patch or
duodenojejunostomy is disease free. Preventing duode-
nal fistulas by avoiding direct placement of any anasto-
mosis over the duodenum or by placing the omentum
between the duodenum and anastomosis appears intu-
itive but is without any supportive evidence.

One of the most common indications for surgery in
duodenal Crohn’s disease is obstruction related to stric-
tures. In most situations, the strictures are short and
occur at the first or second part of the duodenum. They
are usually amenable to endoscopic balloon dilatation
and in most situations symptomatic relief is obtained.
Much of the evidence is from case series, which reflects
the uncommon nature of the problem. Most series
describe 60–80% success rates, but repeated dilatations
are frequently needed. The reported perforation rate of
1–2% makes it a safe procedure even when repeated
procedures are needed, and dilatation should be offered
as first-line treatment [185,653].
There are many indications for surgery in duodenal
Crohn’s disease, but the most common is structuring
refractory to endoscopic treatment. Other indications
include persistent ulcers with pain, upper gastrointesti-
nal bleeding and malignancy.
The most common procedures in the setting of
obstruction are bypass procedures (gastrojejunostomy or
gastroduodenostomy) or strictureplasty. The choice of
procedure should be based on the nature of the stricture
and a clinical assessment of the likelihood of success.
There are no prospective trials to evaluate these proce-
dures and again most of these recommendations are based
on individual case series. In one such series (n = 10) from
the Cleveland Clinic 70% of patients required reoperation
for duodenal Crohn’s disease and in this setting marginal
ulceration was the most common reason for re-do surgery
[657]. On this basis vagotomy is recommended as routine
when performing a bypass procedure, but other series
have not corroborated these findings. The role of vago-
tomy is currently unknown, and given that it is a proce-
dure not commonly performed and can be associated with
profuse diarrhoea it may be safely omitted in this setting.
More recent series have reported similar outcomes by
omitting vagotomy and this may be related to the regular
use of proton pump inhibitors [658].
Strictureplasty is a safe procedure in this setting and
there are no head-to-head to studies comparing stricture-
plasty with bypass procedures. Recurrence and reoperation
rates are reportedly higher after strictureplasty compared
with bypass surgery [658–660]. It should be noted, how-
ever, that published series are based on very small numbers
and that any conclusions are difficult to form.
Primary fistulas are a rare phenomenon in duodenal
Crohn’s disease [661]. The procedure of choice in this
situation is to separate the organ into which the duode-
num is fistulating. The duodenal defect can then be
repaired primarily in a similar manner to that performed
in the presence of a perforated ulcer. In the event of
the duodenal defect being large, a duodenojejunostomy
is the procedure of choice, but it is essential to ensure
that the segment of jejunum used is not affected with
Crohn’s disease.

 Pancreaticoduodenectomy (Whipple’s procedure) has
been described in extreme situations of duodenal Crohn’s
disease [662]. While the morbidity reported was low, it is
not recommended as a first-line procedure as the other
procedures detailed above have good success rates.
Malignancy can occur in long-standing duodenal
Crohn’s disease and the risk is assumed to be the same as
with Crohn’s disease in the rest of the small bowel [663].
A high index of suspicion is required to diagnose this pre-
operatively as the treatment will need to follow oncologi-
cal principles and may require extensive surgery.

Summary
Duodenal Crohn’s disease is probably more prevalent
than has been previously thought. Nonetheless, symp-
toms requiring surgery are rare and as a result, recom-
mendations for surgery are based on case reports and
case series. Surgery, when required, should follow prin-
ciples to offer symptomatic treatment except in the case
of malignancy where oncological treatment principles
should be followed.
Surgery for recurrent ileocaecal Crohn’s
disease
Crohn’s disease is not cured by surgery and the main-
stay of treatment remains medical therapy. The role of
surgery is to address complications (perforation, abscess,
strictures, obstruction, fistula, haemorrhage) and symp-
toms refractory to maximal medical therapy. The need
for close cooperation between surgeon, gastroenterolo-
gist and the wider IBD multidisciplinary team is essen-
tial, not least in patients who have had previous surgery
(ileocaecetomy unless otherwise stated).
Often quoted data from 1955–1989 indicate that
the risk of surgery during the first decade after diagnosis
of terminal ileal Crohn’s disease is 71%, and 44% of
patients who have surgery require a second resection
during the next 10 years [664]. Current population-
based studies show that the likelihood of having bowel
resection has decreased during the 21st century, with
the rate of primary surgery in Crohn’s disease now at
47% in the first decade [50,665]. Changes both in the
diagnosis and the management of the disease may
explain this reduction in surgery rates. It remains the
case that many patients still require multiple operations
for Crohn’s disease [50,665].
Surgery for Crohn’s disease has high stakes due to
the nature of the disease, particularly in the context of
disease-modifying therapies which affect immune func-
tions and tissue healing. This is particularly the case in
surgery for recurrent disease. Intestinal failure is a feared
consequence of luminal Crohn’s disease, and is often
regarded
as
an end-stage
condition
resulting
from
sequential small bowel resections for relapsing disease.
Bowel-sparing techniques such as strictureplasty have
been developed to minimize this risk [666]. However, a
detailed case study from an intestinal failure unit in
England found that loss of small bowel length due to
repeated bowel resections was the cause of intestinal
failure in a minority (22%) of patients with intestinal
failure and Crohn’s disease [667]. The majority (61%)
developed intestinal failure due to abdominal sepsis in
the immediate period after surgery for Crohn’s disease.
Patients in this large group typically underwent multiple
re-laparotomies within a short time frame after the ini-
tial operation. This then led to loss of short bowel,
enterocutaneous fistulation or both.
Recent data confirm the real risk of intestinal failure in
the patient population who require abdominal surgery
for Crohn’s disease. A multicentre study of some 1700
patients found that the incidence of intestinal failure (de-
fined as dependence on parenteral nutrition for more
than 12 months) over 5, 10 and 20 years after index sur-
gery was 0.8%, 3.6% and 8.5%, respectively [180].
The risk of septic complications in particular must
therefore be managed. The risk factors for septic com-
plications are modifiable by meticulous planning of care.
In view of the stakes involved, recurrent Crohn’s disease
should be managed within an experienced multidisci-
plinary team.
Reducing the risk of recurrent disease
When working within the multidisciplinary team, it is
important that surgeons have a working knowledge of
the management options and their efficacy and risk pro-
files. There is a danger in the era of enhanced recovery
pathways
for
the
surgical
team’s
focus
to
be
on
uneventful recovery and early discharge rather than
long-term management strategies. This is amplified as
postsurgical prophylaxis is controversial and so not a
matter of defined protocol.

 Smoking cessation
There is clear evidence that patients with Crohn’s dis-
ease who smoke have an increased risk of recurrent dis-
ease, with a relative risk of 2.5 in patients who smoke
and a substantial reduction of this risk in people who
stop smoking [668,669]. Interventions including nico-
tine replacement therapy to promote smoking cessation
should therefore be a central component of disease
management. It has been shown that smoking cessation
even in the setting of surgery is difficult and profes-
sional support is required for high cessation rates. Ade-
quate resources are therefore required for smoking
cessation support [670]. Whilst ideally patients will have
stopped smoking before their resection, when this has
not been possible the postoperative period can be an
ideal time to intervene and provide support.
Statement 12.1.
Patients with recurrent ileocaecal Crohn’s disease
who are also smokers should be referred for smoking
cessation support, particularly if considering further
surgery.

Medical reduction of the risk of recurrence
It is important to have a structured approach to med-
ium- to long-term care and consider this during the
postoperative hospital stay in order to prevent delays in
secondary prophylaxis or follow-up surveillance. Close
collaboration within the wider multidisciplinary team is
again essential. Evidence for medical maintenance of
remission postsurgery is covered in the BSG guidelines.
Postoperative surveillance
Postoperative stratification of risk for recurrent disease
to guide treatment and surveillance is appealing but at
present there is no validated model or score. However,
a number of models have been proposed and stratifica-
tion based on the ECCO definition of established risk
factors has gained some traction: specifically, these are
smoking, previous surgery, perforating disease, perianal
disease and extensive resection [2,671].
At present there is every reason to tailor treatment
on an individual basis guided by early evidence of recur-
rent disease. Endoscopy is currently the gold standard
as it has been demonstrated that recurrent mucosal dis-
ease precedes clinical recurrence [672]. Endoscopic
appearance is important, and the Rutgeerts severity
score has been shown to predict subsequent clinical
course [193]. A colonoscopy 6 months after surgery to
assess mucosal disease activity and guide escalation of
therapy, as was used in the POCER trial, can currently
be regarded as a reasonable standard [2,673].
The role of imaging in this scenario is not currently
defined; both CT and MRI have appeal as noninvasive
methods, and there are studies showing acceptable sen-
sitivity and specificity for recurrent disease [674,675].
However, they lack the validation of the Rutgeerts score
and colonoscopy has the additional benefit of allowing
biopsies to be taken.
There is great interest in the potential role of biomark-
ers such as serum CRP and faecal calprotectin as surro-
gate
markers
for
inflammation
in
the
extended
postoperative setting. Faecal calprotectin levels have been
shown to have some correlation with endoscopic recur-
rence in a meta-analysis of 613 patients [676]. Retrospec-
tive reanalysis of the POCER trial data found that a cut-
off of faecal calprotectin of > 100 lg/g would have
reduced the need for colonoscopy by 41%, although this
would have come at the cost of missing 11% of patients
with endoscopic recurrence [677,678]. Results of the
TOPICC trial suggested that a faecal calprotectin level of
> 100 lg/g had a much lower sensitivity at detecting
recurrence [679]. Faecal calprotectin appears to be more
sensitive
in
symptomatic
rather
than
asymptomatic
patients [680], with the precise threshold for interven-
tion still unclear. Faecal calprotectin monitoring may
offer a reasonable alternative in patients who decline
colonoscopic surveillance after Crohn’s ileocaecal resec-
tion. The data have not shown a consistent correlation
between raised CRP and endoscopic or clinical recur-
rence and so routine use is not to be recommended.
Statement 12.2.
After small bowel or ileocaecal resection for Crohn’s
disease, patients should undergo endoscopic assess-
ment at 6–12 months to assess mucosal inflamma-
tion.

 strictures in the neo-terminal ileum or colon and does
not apply to primary stricturing disease. Specifically,
balloon dilatation has been shown in large case series
to be successful in some 90% of cases, and when this
is the case repeat surgery is delayed by 3–6 years
[109,681]. Importantly, the perforation rate is around
5%, hence surgical resection should be immediately
available [109]. Balloon dilatation may be appropriate
for strictures with a length of up to 4 cm (see Sec-
tions 2 and 3).
Radiological drainage
One in five patients with symptomatic small bowel
Crohn’s disease develops an abdominal mass at some
point [682]. Cross-sectional imaging will determine
whether this is caused by an abscess or a phlegmon.
The presence of a Crohn’s mass has traditionally been
considered an indication for resection. However, case
series from a number of centres in North America
reflect a shift in management of Crohn’s masses towards
a more conservative approach, at least initially. These
data demonstrate that some 30% of patients with a
Crohn’s mass can be managed nonoperatively [121].
Subsequent aggressive medial therapy may then be insti-
tuted cautiously (see Sections 2 and 3).
Many patients will still require surgery in the medium
or long term, but in this group the staged approach is
likely to reduce morbidity and stoma rates and enable
laparoscopic resection rather than laparotomy. Hence,
aggressive nonoperative initial treatment of penetrating
disease is likely to improve outcomes in Crohn’s disease,
and this is the approach recommended by the ECCO
[2]. These principles apply particularly to recurrent dis-
ease, where surgery is especially challenging.
Occasionally, fistulas are diagnosed between loops of
small bowel or colon in patients with minimal symp-
toms. Such inter-loop fistulas probably represent estab-
lished penetrating disease, and unless associated with a
phlegmon or abscess do not warrant resection. First
principles of Crohn’s disease management apply; surgi-
cal or indeed medical intervention for asymptomatic dis-
ease is rarely indicated. When such inter-loop fistulas
cause symptoms, such as diarrhoea or malabsorption,
medical therapy is unlikely to close them.
Preoperative optimization
Several risk factors for poor outcomes after major
abdominal
surgery
have
been
identified,
including
recent weight loss, intra-abdominal abscess, high-dose
corticosteroid therapy, iron-deficiency anaemia, hypoal-
buminaemia (a marker of systemic inflammation, not
malnutrition) and smoking [186]. All of these risk
factors increase overall morbidity and most increase
the risks of anastomotic dehiscence. Preoperative opti-
mization pathways that combine interventions to cor-
rect such risk factors before surgery have recently been
described
[186,237,683,684]
(see
also
State-
ment 3.13). Such pathways are similar to perioperative
enhanced recovery after surgery pathways and comple-
ment these perioperative pathways by addressing the
more long-term issues described above. They aim to
improve early postoperative outcomes, allowing a safe
primary anastomosis, avoiding a stoma in a higher pro-
portion of cases and enabling a laparoscopic approach
more often.
The duration of such pathways varies between cen-
tres. A washout period from steroids (> 10 mg pred-
nisolone/day) and biological therapies of approximately
6 weeks prior to an elective gastrointestinal anastomosis
is reasonable. During this time, an exclusive enteral diet
is often necessary to prevent progression of disease and
correct malnutrition [685], and in some cases parenteral
nutrition is indicated. Abscesses and phlegmons, anae-
mia, smoking and psychological and other needs are
addressed during this time.
Role for laparoscopic surgery
In addition to data from the large Phase III trials of
laparoscopic vs open surgery for colon cancer which
demonstrate short-term benefits of laparoscopic surgery,
smaller randomized trials and large database studies
demonstrate both short-term and long-term advantages
from laparoscopic bowel resection for Crohn’s disease.
Specifically, those advantages include quicker recovery
and shorter hospital stay, reduced 30-day postoperative
morbidity and reduced risk of reoperation for incisional
hernia and adhesions [131–133,165,686]. Some techni-
cal challenges have been highlighted by larger case ser-
ies, such as the need to consider conversion if entero-
enteric or entero-sigmoid fistulas are suspected, as these
are not amenable to laparoscopic dissection and can be
overlooked without the benefit of direct examination
[168,687].
Although the merits of laparoscopy in surgery for
recurrent disease have not been specifically studied, sim-
ilar advantages are likely in this scenario. However,
laparoscopic dissection is likely to be more complex due
to adhesions, an issue specifically addressed by two large
case series [688,689]. The conversion rate was signifi-
cant (25–32%) and mainly due to adhesions. The rate
of intra-operative complications was low (2–2.5%) but
potentially serious (paraduodenal haematoma and ure-
teric injury). Notably, nearly all patients had previous
open surgery. Thus, it appears reasonable to consider a

Surgical techniques in recurrent Crohn’s disease
Preoperative planning is critical in surgery for recurrent
Crohn’s disease. Careful review of imaging to establish
a preoperative road map minimizes the risk of surgical
misadventure. Almost inevitably preoperative cross-sec-
tional imaging is performed and there are particular
advantages to reviewing these at the multidisciplinary
team meeting with an interested gastrointestinal radiol-
ogist. Particular care should be taken to look for fistulas
and where an incisional hernia is present to map the
abdominal wall defect as well as intestinal anatomy. An
up to date colonoscopy, to avoid missing active colonic
inflammation or strictures, also helps avoid surprises.
Ureteric injury is a concern with re-do surgery of all
kinds and insertion of temporary ureteric catheters at
the time of surgery is worth considering. Quoted rates
of ureteric injury at colorectal surgery vary widely; there
are
concerns
regarding
complications
of
ureteric
catheterization itself and there are no RCTs. However,
if there is a reason to feel the ureters are likely to be
hard to find and at risk (multiple laparotomies, previous
psoas abscess/retroperitoneal sepsis, proximity on cross-
sectional
imaging)
the
benefits
outweigh
the
risks
[690].
As with any challenging adhesiolysis there are advan-
tages to sharp scalpel dissection to minimize the risk of
serosal injury or indeed enterotomy. Dense adhesions
are often stronger than thinned bowel, so great care
should be taken to minimize traction during the adhesi-
olysis. There is an inevitable decision to be made as to
whether to perform a complete adhesiolysis to allow
assessment of the whole small bowel or a more limited
mobilization of the targeted segment. This is where
careful preoperative planning and review of imaging at
the multidisciplinary team meeting is essential.
There is ongoing interest in the extent of mesenteric
resection in surgery for Crohn’s disease and some advo-
cate radical resection of inflamed mesentery, on the
basis that the mesentery is a driver for ongoing pathol-
ogy [175]. However, extensive mesenteric dissection is
associated with a risk of bleeding and mesenteric hae-
matoma, with may compromise perfusion of the anasto-
mosis. The current evidence does not support radical
mesenteric resection.
Anastomotic technique
Surgery for recurrent Crohn’s disease can be prolonged
and technically demanding. The decision as to whether
to form an anastomosis or exteriorize the ends of the
bowel has to be guided by clinical judgement and expe-
rience rather than guidelines. Patients who are malnour-
ished, are on steroids, have active sepsis, evidence of
penetrating disease or are unstable under anaesthetic are
more likely to have an anastomotic complication [186].
A more selective approach to anastomosis appears to be
associated with improved outcomes [691]. There is a
balance between the safety of stoma formation and the
complications associated with stomas themselves.
When the decision is made to form an anastomosis
there is a choice to be made between an end-to-end or
a side-side anastomosis. In patients with a history of
recurrent anastomotic strictures, consideration should
be given to an end-to-end anastomosis as this may facil-
itate balloon dilatation of a recurrent stricture. Recur-
rence is not affected by the choice of anastomotic
technique [143]. ECCO guidelines recommend a sta-
pled side-to-side anastomosis based on two meta-ana-
lyses of anastomotic technique demonstrating a lower
leak rate with stapled side-side compared with hand-
sewn end-to-end anastomosis [2,141,142]. These stud-
ies were based on primary resections for Crohn’s and
cancer surgery, rather than recurrent Crohn’s disease;
the balance may not be the same in patients who have
had multiple laparotomies, prolonged adhesiolysis and
thin or even defunctioned bowel.

 pouch. Failure rates around 15% at 10 years and up to
24% have been reported, although some large institu-
tional series have lower rates [326,334,449,693].
Re-do or revision ileoanal pouch procedures have
been defined or categorized in different ways by various
authors, but for the purposes of this document encom-
pass procedures which involve abdominal exploration
and formation of a new IPAA, using either the existing
pouch or a newly created one. Re-do pouch surgery has
a potential role in the management of some of the com-
plications encountered in patients with an ileoanal
pouch.
Both re-do pouch and ileoanal pouch excision are
complex procedures, performed infrequently – resulting
in a lack of data to inform practice. It is worth bearing
in mind that a recent comprehensive meta-analysis
[694] included only 900 reported cases of abdominal
revisional pouch surgery, many of which did not involve
constructing a new IPAA. The biggest single series [47]
(part included in the meta-analysis) described 502 re-do
pouches, and only three series have reported over 100
patients [47,457,695].
The published experience also encompasses a broad
time frame, from the early days of pouch surgery when
the indications and technique were in development, to
more recent times when better understanding of the
causes of pouch failure, improved imaging and more
effective drug and other treatments have offered suc-
cessful nonsurgical management for many patients with
pouch-related problems. Indications and patient selec-
tion for pouch revision or excision vary greatly within
and between series and are often unclear.
Clinical approach to pouch complications
Most complications which might lead to pouch re-do
or excision present with symptoms of poor pouch func-
tion,
predominantly
high
defaecatory
frequency,
impaired continence and abdominal, pelvic or anal pain
[696]. Some patients with chronic inflammation due to
pouchitis or sepsis develop systemic symptoms, weight
loss and anaemia.
Care needs to be taken to reach an accurate diagno-
sis, bearing in mind that some of these patients have
more than one problem (e.g. chronic pelvic sepsis and
ileoanal anastomotic stricture; anal fistula and proximal
small
bowel
Crohn’s
disease)
[44,696].
Functional
pouch disorder (sometimes called irritable pouch or,
confusingly, ‘pouch dysfunction’) [697] is defined as
the presence of pouch-related symptoms without clini-
cally apparent pathology. This may be a cause of pouch
failure if symptoms are such that the patient would pre-
fer to revert to an ileostomy.

their ileoanal pouch should be fully investigated to

underlying
pathology.

Indications for surgery
The indications for re-do pouch surgery have been
divided by some authors into ‘mechanical’ (or ‘struc-
tural’) and ‘inflammatory/infective’. In some respects
this is useful, and generally outcomes of re-do surgery
for the former are better. However, some indications
do not fit into this categorization. Examples include
acute pouch ischaemia due to thromboembolism of the
mesenteric vessels, recurrent ileoanal anastomotic stric-
turing due to chronic pelvic sepsis, some cases of
chronic pouchitis that are thought to be due to ischae-
mia, and pouch or cuff neoplasia.
Construction error
These include creating a pouch that is too small, too
large or twisted. There have been reports of incomplete
division of the component small bowel segments, lead-
ing to a ‘spur’ within the pouch. The advent of laparo-
scopically assisted ileoanal pouch formation has been

 associated in an increase in patients coming to re-do
pouch surgery because of significant retained rectum
[694]. A long retained rectal cuff is associated with
inflammation, dysplasia, anastomotic stricture and poor
function. Advancement of the ileoanal pouch and cre-
ation of a new, lower anastomosis is a potentially suc-
cessful treatment but can be technically challenging
[694]. Generally, the outcomes of re-do pouch proce-
dures for these indications are better than those for
inflammatory or infective indications [694].
Chronic anastomotic leakage
Chronic anastomotic leakage usually results in a chronic
sinus leading from the anastomosis, which can be asso-
ciated with chronic inflammation of the lower pouch
and recurrent anastomotic stricturing. Re-do pouch is
only feasible in cases where there is sufficient anorectal
cuff between the failed anastomosis and the dentate line
to create a sound new anastomosis.
Perianal sepsis/fistula
Some cases of anal fistula in patients with an ileoanal
pouch appear to be cryptoglandular in origin, with the
internal opening situated at the dentate line, below the
anastomosis. Others are related to small leaks or perianas-
tomotic collections, or very rarely have an internal open-
ing on one of the longitudinal pouch suture/staple lines.
Pouch re-do, with advancement of the pouch–anal
anastomosis below the internal opening of the fistula,
has a place, but only if there is sufficient length below
the internal opening to create an new anastomosis
between it and the dentate line.
Pouch–vaginal fistula
A proportion of pouch–vaginal fistulas are due to con-
struction error, the vagina being caught between the
anvil and head of the circular stapler when the pouch–
anal anastomosis is created. Others may be cryptoglandu-
lar or due to ‘Crohn’s like’ inflammation. Many of these
are amenable to transanal, transvaginal or transperineal
repair (16) (also see Section 10), but there is some evi-
dence that failure of such an attempt compromises the
outcome of subsequent transabdominal revision [694].
Other pouch fistulas
Fistulas to the bladder, proximal small bowel and abdom-
inal wall have been described. Many of these originate
from the ‘blind end’ of the pouch and can be managed
by local repair. Occasionally re-do pouch is required.
Ileoanal anastomotic stricture
This is a common problem, more frequent after muco-
sectomy
and
hand-sewn
than
stapled
ileoanal
anastomosis [694]. In cases resistant to more conserva-
tive measures and where there is sufficient room below
the
anastomosis,
re-do
surgery
may
be
considered
[694].
Chronic pouchitis
Chronic pouchitis (and associated pouch body and inlet
strictures) may be secondary to pelvic sepsis or Crohn’s
disease, or be ‘primary idiopathic pouchitis’, thought to
be a manifestation of ulcerative colitis. Some authors
have also proposed that in a small proportion of cases
inflammation is due to chronic ischaemia.
A further confounding factor in interpreting results
of re-do surgery for pouch inflammation is that the def-
inition of Crohn’s disease is inconsistent. Some centres
label any patient with pouchitis and another ‘Crohn’s
like’ feature (such as anal fistula, pouch–vaginal fistula
or inflammation or stricturing of the immediate pre-
pouch ileum) as Crohn’s disease, whereas others only
do so if definitive histological features or proximal skip-
lesions are identified.
It would be logical to expect poorer outcomes when
pouches are revised for Crohn’s disease or primary idio-
pathic pouchitis, as these are more likely to recur in a
new pouch than ischaemia or sepsis. This does seem to
be borne out in the literature [47,694], despite the dif-
ficulties in interpretation and varying rigour of preoper-
ative investigation.
Neoplasia
Dysplasia and adenocarcinoma can occur in the rectal
cuff below the pouch, most cases having arisen in
patients with previous colorectal dysplasia or carcinoma,
or severe chronic pouchitis. While re-do pouch has been
described in the context of dysplasia, such surgery is
only likely to be appropriate if there is a long rectal cuff.
Most require pouch excision.
A variety of very rare pouch body cancers have also
been described. Only a few case reports exist, and the
outcomes are poor. While in theory a re-do pouch
might be possible for pouch body malignancy, in prac-
tice the extensive surgery required to clear the tumour
and poor prognosis preclude this.
Acute ischaemia
This is a rare complication, which can result from acute
thromboembolism of the mesenteric vessels, twisting of
the small bowel mesentery at pouch formation or inter-
nal herniation (e.g. acute herniation of a loop of small
bowel behind the small bowel mesentery resulting in
occlusion of the mesenteric vessels running to the
pouch). Provided there is sufficient length of small bowel
remaining, re-do pouch formation is often feasible.

 Prolapse
This complication is being seen more frequently. This is
likely to be due to the increasing use of laparoscopically
assisted pouch surgery, which results in fewer adhesions
and a more mobile pouch. Pouchopexy procedures are
usually successful, but re-do pouch has been described
for recurrent prolapse [694].
Poor function
There have been reports of re-do pouch surgery for
poorly functioning pouches where no underlying cause
has been identified. If some of these patients have a
form of gastrointestinal dysmotility or irritable bowel
syndrome, a poor outcome is likely.
Preoperative workup and decision-making
Before re-do pouch surgery is considered, it is impor-
tant to assess the proximal small bowel, pouch and anal
canal.
Statement 13.3
Before pouch revision is attempted it should be
established
whether
the
procedure
is
potentially
technically feasible and appropriate, and the patient
should be fully counselled with regard to the failure
rate, complications and alternatives.
Level of evidence: IV
Grade of recommendation: GP
Consensus: 97.1% (SA 71.4%, A 25.7%)
Proximal small bowel disease should be excluded,
and any previous significant loss of small bowel length
at surgery should be identified. Such loss may make it
impossible for a new pouch to reach the anus, or result
in poor function. Even if the existing pouch is healthy,
it is sometimes significantly damaged during difficult
dissection in the pelvis and cannot be preserved, so a
new pouch may need to be constructed. Old ileostomy
closure sites and other anastomoses can interfere with
this, and ultimately only at surgery can it be established
whether the pouch will reach the anus.
Statement 13.4
Counselling and consent from a patient prior to
revision surgery should emphasize that an end ileost-
omy may prove to be the only option once the orig-
inal pouch is mobilized during surgery.
Level of evidence: IV
Grade of recommendation: GP
Consensus: 100.0% (SA 74.3%, A 25.7%)
There needs to be sufficient distance between the
old anastomosis and the dentate line to create a sound
new anastomosis. Usually this can only be assessed at
examination
under
anaesthetic.
A
successful
re-do
pouch requires a healthy anal canal and sphincter com-
plex with sufficient function to maintain acceptable con-
tinence. While anal physiology testing and endoanal
ultrasound are useful adjuncts, they do not give defini-
tive information on ultimate functional outcome.
Thorough
and
unhurried
patient
counselling
is
essential before undertaking a major revisional pelvic
procedure with significant morbidity and failure rate,
and the sole advantage of potentially avoiding a perma-
nent end ileostomy. Some highly motivated and stoma-
averse patients are prepared to accept the risks and
uncertainties involved, but for others the acceptance of
pouch failure and a permanent ileostomy is preferable.
Technical aspects of surgery
Pouch revision is a difficult procedure, with a median
operating time just over 4 h [694]. The authors of the
largest series of pouch re-do procedures routinely use
ureteric stents or catheters [694] and reported ureteric
injury in 0.5%.
A midline laparotomy is performed with the patient
in a modified Lloyd-Davies position [694]. Adhesions
are divided to allow access to the pelvis. The existing
pouch is mobilized to the pelvic floor with sharp dissec-
tion, with special care being taken if the aim is to pre-
serve and advance it. The decision whether to reuse the
old pouch or create a new one depends on the indica-
tion for surgery and the viability and integrity of the
mobilized pouch. Chronically indurated tissue associ-
ated with chronic sepsis should be excised [47,694].
If a new pouch is being formed this is usually a J
pouch, but if there is difficulty with reach to the anus,
and there is sufficient small bowel, the efferent limb of
a S pouch might provide the required extra length,
although pouch evacuation may be compromised and
Medena catheterization required.
Mucosectomy and hand-sewn anastomosis is usually
required, but a long rectal remnant may allow room for
a double-stapled anastomosis. A transanal drain within
the pouch is sometimes used. A proximal diverting
ileostomy is recommended. It is closed after 3 months,
subject to satisfactory contrast enema and examination
under anaesthetic.

Outcomes
A recent and comprehensive systematic review of salvage
procedures
after
restorative
proctocolectomy
[694]
reported complications in 44%, a 74% ‘success rate’ and a
subsequent 18% pouch excision rate after re-do pouch.
The largest single series [47] reported 502 cases of
re-do IPAA between 1983 and 2014. In 41% a new
pouch was formed, and in the rest the existing pouch
was advanced. There were complications in 53 and 18%
had failed at 10 years. Indications for re-do associated
with poorer outcomes were pouch vaginal fistula, sepsis
and Crohn’s disease. A small number underwent further
re-do, which was successful in some.
Overall, the functional outcomes after re-do are infe-
rior to those after initial ileoanal pouch formation, with
an average defaecatory frequency of six during the day
and two at night [47,699]. Urgency and major noctur-
nal incontinence rates are higher [694] and 50% of
patients report seepage and regular use of pads [694].
About 20% of patients experienced restriction in each of
social, work and sexual functioning [694]. There has
been no objective assessment of erectile or ejaculatory
dysfunction, but this is likely to be significant, given the
nature of the dissection involved. Despite this, patients
undergoing re-do pouch surgery are reported to have
high levels of satisfaction [47,699].

Pouch excision
The literature on ileoanal pouch excision is even more
limited than that on re-do, with a total of just under
400 cases described from five centres [454,700–705].
Two publications each from two of these institutions
report patients from the same cohort. A significant pro-
portion of these pouch excisions were for pouch or cuff
adenomas or cancer in the context of FAP, rather than
in patients with IBD.
Indications
Some causes of pouch failure (such as neoplasia) man-
date pouch excision, but in the presence of others, per-
forming a permanent ileostomy above a pouch left in
place is an option that avoids the morbidity associated
with pouch excision. One study [694] has reported
ileostomy alone and pouch excision to result in similar
outcomes. However, anal pain and seepage occurred in
some patients who had retained their pouch and was
associated with incontinence or outlet obstruction as
the cause of pouch failure. No patient who retained
their pouch developed dysplasia or cancer, but numbers
were small.
Statement 13.7.
It is reasonable to leave a defunctioned failed pouch
in situ, as an intermediate or long-term alternative
to pouch excision where not clinically indicated.
Patients with incontinence or pouch outlet obstruc-
tion as the cause of pouch failure are more likely to
develop troublesome discharge or pain following this
approach.

Surgery
The surgery is essentially similar to re-do pouch but
without re-anastomosis and with the addition of exci-
sion of the anal canal, perineal closure and formation of
an end ileostomy. Operative time and ureteric injury
have not been addressed in any of the reports of ileoa-
nal pouch excision, but are likely to be similar to re-do
pouch.
Complications and outcomes
One perioperative death has been documented [694]
and complication rates of up to 62% [694] have been
reported. The commonest late complication is persis-
tent perineal sinus (defined as an unhealed perineal
wound

surgery),
occurring
in
between 29% [694] and 40% [454,701]. Some authors

Intestinal failure in IBD
Many of the principles of intestinal failure can be gen-
eralized
and
are
not
necessarily
specific
to
IBD,
although up to 50% of patients with intestinal failure
have IBD as the underlying diagnosis [706]. In addi-
tion, there is significant overlap with intestinal failure
and the treatment of recurrent IBD (see Section 12).
Therefore, this section is focused on general princi-
ples.
Definition
There is a surprising degree of confusion regarding the
precise definition of intestinal failure, and more specifi-
cally which surgical problems might be considered to
be in the domain of the highly specialized centres that
carry out significant numbers of these operations. The
third attempt at a national commissioning process is
currently under way. It is hoped that this will identify
a network of specialist units that will provide the medi-
cal and surgical expertise to manage these most com-
plex problems. Referral guidelines have not yet been
formalized.
Fleming and Remington [707] are generally credited
with coining the term intestinal failure, which they
defined as ‘a reduction in the functioning gut mass
below the minimal amount necessary for adequate
digestion and absorption of food’. Many authorities
have since refined the term and offered their own defi-
nitions.
The essence of all definitions is that the condition is
characterized by a failure of gut absorptive function so
that
intravenous
supplementation
or
nutrition
is
needed. The European Society of Parenteral Nutrition
[708] distinguished between intestinal failure, where
there is a reduction of gut function such that intra-
venous
therapy
is
required
to
maintain
health
or
growth, and intestinal insufficiency, where the reduction
in function is significant but does not require intra-
venous therapy.
In 2013 the NHS review [709] into intestinal failure
services suggested a functional classification of intestinal
failure in order to simplify decision-making, transfer and
management of these patients:
Type 1: short term, usually self-limiting loss of gut
function.
This
is
typically
seen
in
postoperative
patients and is often referred to as ‘postoperative
ileus’. Patients in this circumstance may need intra-
venous nutrition but the treatment is not usually
prolonged.
Type 2: this is usually seen as a failure of Type 1
intestinal failure to resolve. It is a prolonged but
reversible loss of intestinal function that lasts weeks
or even months and is often associated with sepsis,
major complications of surgery or renal impairment
and
metabolic
disturbance.
The
management
of
these patients often requires a complex interaction of
surgical, medical, radiological, nursing, dietetic and
critical care teams. Referral to a specialist centre is
strongly recommended.
Type 3: this refers to the long-term need for intra-
venous nutritional therapy with no prospect of reme-
diation. This may be due to loss of intestine,
malabsorption
or
long-term
dysmotility.
These
patients need home total parenteral nutrition (TPN)
therapy.
Intestinal failure in IBD
Crohn’s disease is most commonly associated with Type
3 intestinal failure. In the UK about one-third of cases
of Type 3 failure are in Crohn’s disease [710]. The inci-
dence in ulcerative colitis is much lower, due mainly to
sparing of the small bowel. However, cases still occur
through complications such as delayed colectomy in
acute severe colitis or mesenteric infarction following
colectomy.
In Crohn’s disease intestinal failure arises as a result
of:
• Complications of surgery for intra-abdominal sepsis.
• Extensive small bowel disease
• Multiple resections and short bowel syndrome (see
later).

IBD Surgical Guidelines
 Of these three causes, surgical complication is by far
the most common, with incidences as high as 8.5%
20 years after the index surgical procedure [180,667].
Predisposing factors include younger age at diagnosis
and first operation, stricturing disease and family history
of IBD [711].
Pathogenesis
Type 1 and 2 intestinal failure are, by definition, situa-
tions which are potentially remediable. Most commonly,
failure is caused by acute perioperative physiological dis-
turbance. These conditions may occur immediately fol-
lowing any abdominal surgery but can also recur after
apparent resolution has been achieved. Acute loss of
intestinal function in this manner has a confused termi-
nology. The terms postoperative ileus and small bowel
obstruction are both employed even though specific
diagnostic tests to distinguish between these entities are
seldom undertaken. It is often not critically important
to make that differentiation since the treatment para-
digm is usually conservative. Many operations are com-
plicated by a short-term derangement of gut function;
recovery is often heralded by the passage of flatus or
the action of a stoma. It is essential to realize that this
first evidence of the return of intestinal motility does
not show that an ileus has fully resolved. The safest and
probably the best definition of a full return to normal
gut function is when an individual can tolerate a full
diet [712] without any nausea or vomiting and they are
passing flatus or stool.
Type 1 intestinal failure
There is no clear cut off between Type 1 and Type 2
intestinal failure. Type 1 can be considered as a prolon-
gation of the ‘normal’ loss of intestinal function and a
delayed return to normal gastrointestinal motility after
an abdominal operation. A small number of studies sug-
gest that gastrointestinal motility returns very rapidly
after surgical insult. The traditional teaching that it nor-
mally takes several days for gastrointestinal function to
normalize in the absence of complications is not borne
out by modern experience. The enhanced recovery after
surgery programmes that have been so successfully
introduced are strong clinical evidence that the gut is
capable of functional activity very soon after surgery,
even when an anastomosis has been fashioned [713].
The key issue in the management of this complication
is whether and when to consider intravenous nutrition if
gut function is not rapidly restored. A lack of oral intake
has been shown to be associated with diminished intesti-
nal muscle function and loss of the gut barrier function.
TPN does not protect against these. Therefore oral/na-
sogastric feeding is always preferable if it can be tolerated.
NICE guidance suggests that intravenous nutrition
should be considered when a patient has had little or
nothing by mouth for 5 days and is likely to eat little or
nothing for the next 5 days [714].
Statement 14.1
Enteral nutrition should be re-introduced as soon as
practicable after surgery for IBD. Intravenous nutri-
tion should be considered after elective and emer-
gency IBD surgery in patients who are malnourished
and in whom establishment of diet within the next
few days is considered unlikely.

Consensus: 93.9% (SA 57.6%, A 36.4%)
Type 2 intestinal failure
The management of patients in this group is always
complex
and
requires
sophisticated
multidisciplinary
team working. Emergency surgery for intestinal perfora-
tion, anastomotic leak, persistent sepsis, wound compli-
cations, deep sepsis and full-thickness abdominal wound
dehiscence are all common pathways into this scenario.
The management of these patients should adhere to
broad principles. However, each case presents unique
challenges and should be considered on its own merit.
The elements of care can be broken down into four key
areas [714].
Nutritional requirements
Hospitals should all have a nutrition team for the man-
agement of intravenous nutritional therapy. Patients
require personalized prescriptions addressing their speci-
fic needs [715]. TPN may be delivered by peripheral or
central venous access. Peripheral TPN is not employed
in the longer term and should be reserved for those
patients who are likely to need intravenous therapy for
fewer than 14 days. Prolonged TPN requires the use of
tunnelled central lines.
The 2010 NCEPOD audit into intravenous nutrition
in the UK found that the decision to commence TPN
was delayed in almost a fifth of patients [716]. Nine per
cent of patients had a delay in the provision of TPN
after prescription. Conversely a significant number of
patients had TPN for 3 days or fewer suggesting that
the decision to treat with TPN was erroneous. Overall
NCEPOD concluded that TPN was not indicated in
almost 30% of the patients they studied. Shockingly,
NCEPOD judged the nutritional care to be ‘good’ in

 only 19% of patients. TPN requirements were found to
be poorly documented in just over half the patients and
the treatment was adequately monitored in just over
half the patients.
In principle a TPN prescription is relatively simple,
comprising water, electrolytes, energy (a combination of
fat and carbohydrate), essential amino acids, vitamins
and trace elements. In practice this is much more com-
plicated and requires expert prescription and supervi-
sion. Modern formulations are most often provided as
single ‘big bags’ that are prepared in sterile conditions
and provide a single day’s requirements in one infusion
unit. More complex prescriptions can be catered for by
the use of multichambered bags.
A typical prescription might include:
• Water 25–35 ml/kg/day;
• Nitrogen 0.17–3 g/kg/day. Grams of nitrogen is
shorthand for the ‘protein’ component in a TPN pre-
scription: this comprises the essential amino acids and
glutamine; the building blocks for protein synthesis;
• Carbohydrate: typically providing up to 60% of daily
energy requirements this is usually given in the form of
dextrose and can be provided in a range of concentra-
tions;
• Lipid: the most potent source of energy, this is used to
reduce the amount of carbohydrate required. It also
acts as a vehicle for the infusion of the fat-soluble vita-
mins. Lipid infusion reduces the need for large volumes
of glucose and addresses the need for essential fatty
acids. The daily dose should not exceed 1–1.5 g/
kg/day;
• Electrolytes and micronutrients: daily losses will dic-
tate the electrolyte prescription which must be tai-
lored to maintain homeostasis. In cases where there
has been significant loss of intestinal length it is
important to ensure that calcium and magnesium
levels are adequately maintained.
Monitoring of TPN
A wide variety of clinical and laboratory tests are
required in order to monitor TPN prescriptions accu-
rately. In the surgical patient with Type 1 or 2 intestinal
failure there may be considerable difficulties with intesti-
nal flux and/or the presence of sepsis. The vast majority
of these patients should be considered to be nutrition-
ally unstable and therefore undergo relatively intensive
monitoring.
Daily weighing should be carried out if possible. This
is more a measure of day-to-day fluid balance rather than
nutritional progress, nevertheless it is a key parameter.
Other anthropometric measures such as grip strength
and triceps fat thickness may be measured less frequently
but offer validated measures of nutritional status.
Serum electrolytes, liver function, calcium, magne-
sium and phosphate should be measured daily until sta-
bility has been established. The inflammatory markers
CRP and white cell count should be monitored until
stable. Cholesterol and triglycerides should be measured
on a weekly basis. Trace elements should be measured
as a baseline at commencement of treatment and then
monitored accordingly.
The NCEPOD report [716] established that signifi-
cant numbers of patients developed metabolic complica-
tions of treatment that could have been reduced or
even eliminated by an adequate monitoring regime. The
report called for regular and documented clinical moni-
toring as a mandatory recommendation, with clearly
defined objectives for TPN.
Statement 14.2.
The recommendations of BAPEN, NICE and NCE-
POD on perioperative nutritional support are all
clearly set out and provide guidance for firmly
enforced protocols and bundles of care in all hospi-
tals.

Consensus: 93.8% (SA 62.5%, A 31.3%)
Route of administration
Peripheral TPN may be administered, though it is
unsuitable for long-term use or the infusion of high-
energy, high-osmolality feeding regimes. Central venous
catheter placement inserted with imaging guidance,
placing the tip of the catheter in the superior vena cava,
is the most commonly employed method of administra-
tion.
Complications of TPN
In common with all complex treatments the potential
complications of TPN are legion. They can be broadly
classified as line-related and metabolic.
The NCEPOD report found that 26% of patients
suffered catheter-related complications; half of which
were thought to have been preventable [716]. Compli-
cations of insertion are the same as any central venous
catheterization and include pneumothorax, bleeding
and extravasation. Line fracture and infection are the
two complications specific to TPN lines that merit dis-
cussion. Line fracture is most often seen in Type 3
patients on home TPN. These fractures can sometimes
be salvaged by specialist centres. Most of these patients
will have access to advice and help in the management
of this complication.

 Central line sepsis is a more significant risk that is not
uncommon in the hospital setting, particularly when
patients are critically ill requiring treatment on the inten-
sive care unit or transfer between hospitals. Line infection
rates vary considerably between hospitals. The major
cause of line sepsis is poor management of the line itself.
It is widely held by TPN specialists that feeding lines
should be tunnelled central lines placed exclusively for
the administration of TPN. Other uses, blood sampling,
drug and supplementary fluid administration should not
be carried out through the designated feeling line. TPN
line infections can be minimized by the implementation
of bundles of care that ensure minimal handling of the
line and rigorously enforced care of the line [714].
Statement 14.3
Management of patients with Type 2 intestinal fail-
ure who have had surgery for IBD should adhere to
best practice principles including use of dedicated
lumen tunnelled lines where feasible, care bundles to
reduce the risk of line sepsis, prescription and over-
sight by a multidisciplinary nutrition team, regular
and accessible monitoring of metabolic status, and
audit of outcomes.

Surgical management of Type 2 intestinal failure
Each patient presents a unique set of surgical, medical,
nutritional, psychological and nursing challenges. All-
encompassing generalizations regarding their manage-
ment are problematic but it is helpful to consider three
phases of management.
Stabilisation of the patient
1. Sepsis. Type 2 intestinal failure often arises as a com-
plication of a catastrophic abdominal illness. It is incum-
bent
upon
colorectal
and
emergency
surgeons
to
recognize when a patient is at high risk of developing
septic complications and thereby seek to keep the surgi-
cal management as simple as possible. The ACPGBI
guidance on the management of anastomotic leakage
offers strong advice to avoid overambitious attempts to
salvage a failed anastomosis [717].
There is an increasing trend towards damage control
surgery with temporary abdominal closure, in parallel
with the damage control philosophy from trauma sur-
gery, in very severely ill patients [718–720]. A number
of patients will require this salvage technique to manage
an abdomen that is too tight to close or where abdomi-
nal
compartment
syndrome
has
developed.
Many
patients with Type 2 intestinal failure have suffered from
failure to close the abdominal wall. It is vital to establish
abdominal wall closure whenever possible. Series from
the USA and Europe show that restoration of the midline
can be achieved in up to 90% of patients by utilizing tech-
niques such as topical negative pressure wound therapy
with mesh-mediated medial abdominal wall traction or
devices such as the ABRA system [718]. Failure to close
the abdominal wall, leaving the patient with a laparos-
tomy, is profoundly morbid resulting in the formation of
an enterocutaneous fistula in up to 25% and increased
mortality [721].
A key to the management is to identify the underly-
ing cause of the persistent loss of gut function after sur-
gery.
Many
of
these
patients
have
unresolved
complications; most of which are septic. Monitoring the
systemic inflammatory reaction by CRP, platelet count
and white cell count is helpful to document changes
over time. A very high index of suspicion should be
maintained and sources of sepsis sought when there is a
failure to progress. Anecdotally most specialist services
will perform a CT on a transfer patient on arrival to
screen for unresolved intra-abdominal sepsis.
Surgical intervention around the time of diagnosis of
Type 2 intestinal failure is very rarely employed. These
patients, between 2 and 4 weeks after their index surgery,
have very hostile abdominal cavities where the risks of
surgery far outweigh the benefits. Deep sepsis, when
identified, is best managed by interventional radiology.
Systemic antibiotics or antifungals may be required
according to the results of appropriate cultures.
Statement 14.4
Midline closure should be achieved in more than
90% of temporary abdominal closure cases. Local
audit should ensure that patients are not left with
avoidable laparostomy wounds.

bowel stomas or fistulas may additionally have very chal-

attention needs to be paid to maintaining fluid and

balance,

 with short bowel will be net excretors of fluids and this
may be exacerbated by oral intake.
Intestinal flux can be modified by a number of phar-
macological agents. The most commonly employed are
proton pump inhibitors and octreotide.
Growth hormone and glutamine in addition to diet
have been shown in a few studies to be effective in
increasing the absorptive capacity of the small bowel.
Byrne et al. found a 39% increase in protein absorption
and a 33% decrease in stool volume in 16 patients [723].
However, these findings have not been replicated in
other series and double-blind cross-over trials [724,725].
Octreotide is widely employed to prolong gut transit
time and to reduce intestinal output. There is some evi-
dence to suggest that this is an efficacious treatment,
although its effect is often modest [726].
Loperamide and other opiates are also known to
slow gut transit and have a role in attempts to manage
high-output stomas. Omeprazole and other H2 antago-
nists have been shown to result in a modest increase in
water reabsorption, although there is little evidence to
show that it has the potential to help a patient get off
TPN [727].

Management of the wound
Enterocutaneous
(sometimes
named
entero-atmo-
spheric) fistulas are a common complication in patients
with Type 2 intestinal failure. These are often poorly
controlled, arising in exteriorized loops of small bowel
in a wide-open abdomen after dehiscence or planned
laparostomy. Management of the wound is complex
and may require a variety of approaches. Attempts to
control fistulas by the use of indwelling catheters are
seldom helpful in our experience. The principal aim of
management is to try to isolate the active fistula in
order to collect gut output as neatly as possible to allow
the rest of the wound to granulate and heal [722].
Topical negative pressure has often been cited as a
cause of fistula development in the open abdomen. How-
ever, there is little convincing evidence to support this
assertion [728]. It can certainly be employed in the pres-
ence of a fistula as long as a good seal can be obtained
and the fistula output collected effectively [729].
More often it is impossible to manage wounds in this
fashion and a wide-mouthed wound manager can be
employed akin to a giant stoma appliance. Scrupulous
care must be taken to try and prevent leakage of intesti-
nal contents onto the abdominal skin as the wound
matures and contracts. Dressing these wounds is oner-
ous and requires a good degree of skill and experience.
Larger centres will have specialist teams combining
wound management and stoma therapy expertise.
Where there is a significant length of small bowel
downstream from the wound nutritional management
can be simplified by the practice of distal enteroclysis,
for example tube feeding into the distal defunctioned
gut [730]. This phase of treatment would usually com-
mence after a patient has been fully stabilized from a
wound and metabolic point of view.
Statement 14.6.
In patients with Type 2 intestinal failure, wound

Surgery
Indications for surgery in the short term are very lim-
ited. Every effort should be made to avoid surgical
intervention until at least 6 and preferably 12 months
have passed from the original surgical illness [731,732].
The development of prolapse in an abdominal fistula is
generally taken to be a sign that there is some move-
ment within the abdominal cavity, suggesting that the
peritoneal cavity has become surgically navigable. The
‘pinch test’ where the thin skin of a laparostomy can be
pinched together without picking up underlying bowel
loops is another helpful sign. Great patience may be
required as the surgical team can come under intense
pressure to act sooner than is judicious. These patients
and their carers often suffer tremendously with very dif-
ficult wounds. Social and psychological support is an
integral part of managing the problem in a holistic and
coordinated fashion.
The aim of most surgery in this context is to restore
intestinal continuity and thereby obviate the need for
intravenous
nutrition.
Work-up

these
patients
includes the construction of a full road map of the
intestinal anatomy by antegrade and retrograde contrast
examinations. Fistulography or thorough assessment by

is

 radiological investigations allow the team to measure
the total residual small bowel length and thereby the
likelihood of success in weaning a patient off TPN. The
investigations also help the surgeon to understand the
anatomy of the small bowel before embarking upon
technically demanding and high-risk surgery.
Meticulous surgical technique is required in order
to gain access to the abdominal cavity. Dissection of
the bowel loops from a laparostomy scar can be partic-
ularly challenging, often necessitating delicate sharp
dissection to avoid damage to the residual small bowel.
Unwavering efforts to preserve intestinal length while
freeing adhesions and preparing an anastomosis are
mandatory. There is no good evidence to show that
any anastomotic technique is clearly superior. Anecdo-
tally many experts in the field profess to prefer a
hand-sutured single-layer interrupted serosubmucosal
method. When multiple anastomoses have been fash-
ioned there is a case to be made to defunction the
reconstruction
with
a
proximal
loop
stoma. When
intestinal continuity is restored in a patient needing an
extensive soft tissue reconstruction of the abdominal
wall defunctioning should also be considered, but is
by no means mandatory.
Bowel that has been defunctioned for a long time
can become very narrow and appear quite atrophic. This
presents a particularly difficult anastomosis to fashion,
with a protracted postoperative course being the expec-
tation. Distal feeding via a tube into a distal fistula may
have a place to play in preparing the distal small bowel
for being brought back into continuity, although this
technique has not been formally published.
Restoration of continuity in patients with critically
short small bowel may well be of considerable therapeutic
benefit. If the whole colon remains in situ patients often
have surprisingly normal stool frequencies. The resorp-
tive capacity of the colon makes fluid balance manage-
ment considerably easier. This alone can be enough of an
indication to restore continuity even when it is not
expected that the patient will be able to wean off TPN. A
small number of patients with critically short bowel will
succeed in weaning off TPN after restoration of intestinal
continuity after enterocolic anastomosis, though it is not
always easy to predict the degree of adaptation that will
occur in an individual patient.
Statement 14.7.
In patients with Type 2 intestinal failure the princi-
pal aim of definitive surgery is to restore intestinal
continuity and eliminate need for intravenous nutri-
tion, at a time when the patient’s metabolic and
nutritional status are optimized and sufficient intra-
abdominal healing has taken place to minimize the
risks of the restorative surgical procedure.

Abdominal wall reconstruction
Patients with Type 2 intestinal failure often present
with
large
midline
hernias or
defects
that
require
repair at the same time as their intestinal surgery.
The timing of these operations is critical and surgery
should not be attempted until the abdominal cavity
and the patient have fully recovered from the index
procedure. A rule of thumb is that salvage surgery of
this
nature
should
not
be
undertaken
< 6 months
after the last operation; an interval of 1 year is often
preferable. This allows time for the abdomen to set-
tle, the patient to be stabilized on TPN or enteral
feeding and for a comprehensive preoperative work-up
to be carried out. Further details of techniques for
surgery are out with the scope of this section. The
reader may refer to the ESCP consensus guidelines
on intestinal failure [733].
Type 3 intestinal failure
Surgery has relatively little to contribute in the manage-
ment of Type 3 intestinal failure and most need home
parenteral nutrition. Some patients in this category will
be suitable for small bowel transplantation. A low
threshold should be maintained for referral to one of
the two commissioned centres.
Bowel lengthening and reverse loop procedures
Procedures to slow intestinal transit by reversing seg-
ments of small bowel such as the Bianchi or serial trans-
verse enteroplasty techniques are rarely performed in
adults and have only been reported in two patients with
IBD [734].
Intestinal transplantation
Currently 100 adult intestinal transplants are performed
in the world each year. Around 11% of transplants for
short bowel are due to Crohn’s disease [735]. The
choice between transplant and home parenteral nutri-
tion relates to predicted survival, with home parenteral
nutrition
offering
superior
long-term
outcome
and
therefore
being the first
choice for most
Crohn’s
patients with Type 3 intestinal failure. Transplant is
reserved for those with complications of parenteral
nutrition.

 Short bowel in IBD
This is seldom seen in ulcerative colitis and is usually
the result of complications at the time of emergency
colectomy. Less often it might be seen after ileoanal
pouch surgery.
Short bowel syndrome and Type 3 intestinal failure
occur more frequently in patients with Crohn’s disease,
although the frequency appears to be decreasing. This
reflects
the
increasing
effectiveness
of
modern
immunomodulatory therapies in Crohn’s disease and a
more conservative approach to resection in surgical
patients. The predominant cause of short bowel in this
cohort historically is thought to have been excessive
resectional surgery. Patients with multifocal and com-
plex small bowel Crohn’s disease should probably be
confined to highly specialized centres.
IBD surgery in adolescents and transition
The incidence of IBD in the paediatric population is ris-
ing worldwide [736]. Up to 25% of patients with IBD
present before the age of 18 years and a national survey
of IBD in children in the UK aged < 16 years showed
the incidence to be 5.2 per 100 000 individuals [737].
However,
the
incidence
has
increased
to
7.2
per
100 000 in Scotland [738] and 9.3 per 100 000 in
southern England [739] over the past two decades.
IBD in adolescence can lead to multiple problems,
including growth failure, delayed sexual development,
poor nutrition and loss of education due to reduced
school attendance. Therefore, the aims of treatment are
not solely focused on symptom control but also to facil-
itate normal growth and sexual development, to mini-
mize disruption to education and to enhance self-
esteem and healthy peer relationships.
Despite advances in medical therapy, surgery remains
an important treatment modality in adolescents with
IBD. It is generally reserved for patients with disease
that is refractory to medical management, when there
are complications of the medical treatment, when there
is significant growth retardation despite medical therapy
or when there are complications that require more
urgent
or
emergency
intervention,
such
as
bowel
obstruction, perforation or haemorrhage.
Given the complex and multifactorial nature of the
decision-making in adolescent IBD, it is imperative that
any surgeon working within this setting is a member of a
paediatric IBD multidisciplinary team. Surgeons operat-
ing on adolescents with IBD should be experienced and
well-trained specialist IBD surgeons, whether this is from
an adult colorectal surgery or paediatric surgery back-
ground. Sometimes it will be appropriate for both special-
ities to advise and operate together. Other members of
this multidisciplinary team are likely to include paediatric
gastroenterologists, specialist nurses, dieticians, radiolo-
gists and stoma nurses, with easy access to psychological
and psychiatric support when required. There are data
confirming that colorectal surgeons whose main practice
is in treating adults can provide safe and effective surgical
care to adolescent patients when working within a paedi-
atric IBD multidisciplinary team [740,741].

Crohn’s disease
Resection
Ileocaecal and small bowel resections are the most fre-
quent operation that adolescents with Crohn’s disease
undergo. The main indications for surgery are stricture
formation, medically resistant disease and perforating/
fistulizing disease. Use of small bowel MRI enteroclysis
provides detailed anatomical and disease-specific infor-
mation, and aids clinical decision-making when consid-
ering surgical intervention [742]. In an adolescent with
limited symptomatic ileocaecal Crohn’s disease, it is rea-
sonable to discuss as a multidisciplinary team the option
of surgery at the time of considering escalation to bio-
logical therapy, as there are rare but potentially signifi-
cant
complications
of
anti-TNF
therapy
in
the
adolescent population, namely hepatosplenic T-cell lym-
phoma [743], and it may be appropriate to leave bio-
logical therapy for later in adult life when the disease
recurs. There are several case series confirming that
small bowel and ileocaecal resection procedures can be
performed safely with a laparoscopic approach in adoles-
cents, with reductions in postoperative pain and hospital
stay achievable with this approach [744,745]. SILS has
also been shown to feasible in this cohort [746],
although its benefit over standard laparoscopic resection
is yet to be demonstrated (see Section 3).
Strictureplasty
The aim of preserving as much bowel length as possible
in all patients with Crohn’s disease should always be
borne in mind, but this is particularly pertinent in ado-
lescents due to their high likelihood of requiring further
surgery later in adult life. There are few data on

higher disease recurrence rate in adolescents after stric-
tureplasty when compared with resection [748].
Statement 15.2.
Strictureplasty is a bowel-preserving technique that
may be considered in adolescents with small bowel
Crohn’s disease. Clinicians should be aware that
there is concern of possibly higher recurrence rate
when compared with resection, with an experienced
inflammatory bowel disease surgeon balancing rela-
tive risks of disease recurrence and long-term short

Perianal Crohn’s disease
Symptoms from perianal Crohn’s disease can be particu-
larly disabling and have a high impact on quality of life
in the adolescent population [749]. Up to 15% of ado-
lescents with Crohn’s disease will have evidence of peri-
anal involvement at the time of presentation [750], and
surgical intervention is often required [751]. The role
of the surgeon, in combination with the multidisci-
plinary team, is to drain any sepsis and control any anal
fistulas with loose setons such that medical therapy (par-
ticularly azathioprine and anti-TNF therapy) can then
be initiated by the paediatric gastroenterology team.
Imaging with MRI is useful for the operating surgeon
in terms of delineating the anatomy of any collections
and
fistula
tracks.
A
conservative,
nonexcisional
approach should be recommended for anal skin tags, as
wound healing may be problematic. In severe, medically
resistant cases of perianal Crohn’s disease, defunctioning
with a stoma may be necessary, but there should be
careful counselling of the patient and their family as the
risk of subsequent proctectomy and permanent stoma is
as high as 50% in this patient group [752].
The more novel, sphincter-conserving methods for
anal fistula treatment, such as anal fistula plug, fibrin
glue, over the scope clip and adipose-derived stem cells,
are not well described in the adolescent literature.

Perianal Crohn’s disease in adolescents requires joint

Ulcerative colitis
Colectomy
Surgery in adolescents with ulcerative colitis is generally in
the form of an initial subtotal colectomy and ileostomy.
The indications for this are much the same as in adults,
with failure of medical therapy being most common. Once
again, the additional issues around delayed growth and sex-
ual maturation, potential poor nutrition and loss of educa-
tion need to be borne in mind when considering this
possible surgical treatment option in adolescents. The aim
of removing the colon in this setting is to return the adoles-
cent patient to a good quality of life without the need for
any oral medication. Laparoscopic surgery is a safe
approach for subtotal colectomy and ileostomy in adoles-
cents [740,744,753], where expertise for this exists. In
addition, single-port colectomy has been shown to be safe
and feasible in this setting [754].
The impact of a stoma on the adolescent patient is
not to be underestimated. This should be broached
openly with the patient and family at as early a stage as
possible when surgery is being considered. The input of
stoma nurses and specialist IBD nurses is key, with
counsellors and psychologists providing additional input
as required. Although subsequent proctectomy and per-
manent ileostomy is possible for all patients with ulcera-
tive
colitis,
adolescents
are
generally
keen
to
be
considered for possible reconstructive surgery.

 practice. There is no doubt that IPAA is feasible in chil-
dren and adolescents [755], with high levels of satisfac-
tion at long-term follow-up [756]. However, as the sole
indication for this procedure is for the quality of life of
living without a stoma, there is an argument to suggest
that this could be reserved until the adolescent patient
with an ileostomy has completed their growth and educa-
tion, thus entering adulthood. This argument needs to
be balanced against the impact of living with a stoma
during the crucial development years of adolescence.
Anecdotally, experienced practitioners tend to wait
until adulthood if at all possible, as many of the poten-
tial complications of IPAA surgery may be difficult to
fully comprehend and weigh up during the adolescent
years. These include impotence, retrograde ejaculation,
infertility, dyspareunia, inability to orgasm and pouch–
vaginal fistula, amongst others.
There are some emerging data from the adult IBD
literature to suggest that laparoscopic IPAA surgery
may lead to reduced rates of infertility [298] and
increased rates of pregnancy [417] in women, probably
as a result of reduced pelvic adhesions [757] (see Sec-
tion 6), thus making a laparoscopic approach potentially
attractive in this particular patient group.
Statement 15.5.
Ileal pouch–anal anastomosis is a common treatment
choice for restoration of intestinal continuity in ado-
lescents with ulcerative colitis, although the optimal
timing of surgery has yet to be defined. A laparo-

Ileorectal anastomosis
Ileorectal anastomosis is one option to potentially allow
a patient to live without a stoma and also to avoid the
potential morbidity that is associated with the proctec-
tomy component of IPAA (including infertility). There
is generally a reduced stool frequency after ileorectal
anastomosis compared with IPAA. However, colectomy
with ileorectal anastomosis is not commonly formed in
the setting of ulcerative colitis, with no data available
from the paediatric literature. In adults, it is usually
considered as a two-stage procedure with initial colec-
tomy and ileostomy while the patient is on maximal
medical therapy followed by a subsequent second opera-
tion with ileostomy take down and ileorectal anastomo-
sis. Due to the high likelihood of recurrent proctitis,
patients would generally be advised to use topical ther-
apy to treat the rectum following ileorectal anastomosis
for ulcerative colitis. There is currently a resurgence of
interest in this technique in the treatment of adults with
ulcerative colitis who require surgery [430] (see Sec-
tion 7) but to date this does not seem to have been
widely adopted in the treatment of adolescents.
Statement 15.6.
Ileorectal anastomosis is a possible surgical option in
adolescents with ulcerative colitis, but no data exist
to suggest it should be considered more frequently
in the adolescent population.

Transition care
The transition from paediatric to adult care can be a
potentially stressful time for the adolescent with IBD. It
is generally undertaken between the ages of 16 and
18 years, but ideally when the patient has also acquired
some self-management skills in terms of being able to
speak with the treating doctor or nurse alone, under-
standing their disease process and management and
being willing to adhere to any treatment with an under-
standing of the risks, benefits and alternatives to this
[46,758]. A joint paediatric–adult clinic, as part of the
transition process, is the ideal model. A specialist IBD
nurse is an essential coordinator during this process,
but an adult colorectal surgeon who has been part of
the paediatric IBD multidisciplinary team may often
facilitate transition too, by providing continuity through
to the adult IBD multidisciplinary team treating the
patient in the future.

The process of transition for patients with IBD from
paediatric to adult care requires careful coordination,

 whereas Crohn’s disease has a slight female preponder-
ance. About a quarter of women affected with IBD will
conceive after their diagnosis is made [759,760].
Evidence suggests that pregnancy has a mixed influ-
ence on IBD. The incidence and disease course in
Crohn’s disease appears unaffected by pregnancy pro-
vided the patient continues to take IBD medication.
The incidence and activity of ulcerative colitis, however,
is slightly increased during pregnancy [761–764]. Of
those who conceive while in remission about a third will
flare during pregnancy. Of those who conceive with
active disease this activity continues throughout preg-
nancy in two-thirds of patients [763,765–768].
Inflammatory Bowel Disease appears to have a detri-
mental effect on pregnancy. There is an increased inci-
dence of prematurity, low birth weight, congenital
abnormalities and increased caesarean section rates in
woman with active IBD [769]. It is the active disease
that confers the risk [770–772]. Disease control is thus
paramount.
The medical management of IBD during the preg-
nancy is now well defined. Although beyond the scope
of this section, there is mounting experience to support
the safe use of most disease-modifying drugs. With the
notable
exceptions
of
methotrexate,
mycophenolate
mofetil, thalidomide and certain of the anti-TNF agents
in the third trimester there is a clear benefit in continu-
ing
medications
and
maintaining
remission
[762,764,768,772–774].
Despite advances in the medical management some
patients will still require surgery during pregnancy.
Management is complicated by the presence of two
patients, the woman and her unborn fetus. The man-
agement strategy adopted will be uniquely case specific
and requires a multidisciplinary approach with obstetri-
cians, neonatologists, obstetric anaesthetists, gastroen-
terologists and colorectal surgeons [775–777].

Assessment and staging
Accurate assessment of disease activity is important if
appropriate
decisions
are
to
be
made.
Clinical
assessment is compounded by the normal physiological
changes of pregnancy and abdominal assessment is com-
pounded by the gravid uterus. Commonly used labora-
tory indices such as haemoglobin concentration, serum
albumin and ESR are affected by the physiological
changes of pregnancy and can mislead the unwary.
Parameters such as temperature, stool frequency and
CRP levels are unaffected and may take more promi-
nence in assessment [761,778].
Symptoms and signs of sepsis can be atypical in preg-
nancy: classical signs may not be present and progres-
sion can be more rapid than in the nonpregnant state.
Tools such as the Modified Early Obstetric Warning
Score (MEOWS), early assessment of arterial blood
gases with early recourse to broad-spectrum antibiotics
and critical care input should be considered. It is impor-
tant for the IBD team to note that amoxicillin/clavu-
lanic acid is associated with necrotizing enterocolitis in
the neonate [779].
The surgeon should be aware of current thoughts on
the safety of imaging techniques in pregnancy and
weigh up the risks of the investigation against the infor-
mation it is likely to return.
Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy during pregnancy
appears safer than colonoscopy [780,781]. Data on the
safety of lower gastrointestinal endoscopy during preg-
nancy are poor but it probably does involve a small risk
to the fetus. The fetus is inherently sensitive to maternal
hypoxia and hypotension secondary to sedation, dehy-
dration or aortocaval compression by the uterus. The
most significant reported risk is preterm labour in up to
5% of cases [782]. The American Society of Gastroin-
testinal

guidelines
suggest
colonoscopy
where deemed necessary should not be unreasonably
withheld, preferably in the second trimester using no or
minimal sedation. Attention should be given to patient
positioning, maternal and fetal monitoring as appropri-
ate and use of minimal abdominal pressure directed
away from the uterus [783]. In practice an unprepared,
unsedated flexible sigmoidoscopy will suffice in most
acute situations.

 Ultrasound
and
MRI scanning
are
the imaging
modalities of choice in pregnancy as they are not associ-
ated with known risk to the fetus [784]. Gadolinium is
teratogenic and should be avoided wherever possible,
particularly in the first trimester.
Imaging techniques that expose the fetus to ioniz-
ing radiation are controversial. The radiation dose to
embryo or fetus from any diagnostic procedure in cur-
rent use today should pose no risk of death, malforma-
tion, growth retardation or mental impairment in the
unborn child. These risks become relevant at extreme
doses over 100 mGy [785]. More controversial is the
risk of inducing cancer in the unborn fetus after birth
with techniques that use lower-dose radiation. This
risk increases as the dose of radiation increases. At a
radiation dose of about 25 mGy, CT scanning of an
abdomen and pelvis is estimated to double the natural
risk of childhood cancer (to below 1 in 200 and
mostly below 1 in 1000) but the absolute risk of life-
time cancer is likely to still be < 1%. The dose of radi-
ation
from
a
plain
abdominal
radiograph
by
comparison is between 0.1 and 3 mGy. Such examina-
tions should be avoided unless the health of the
mother is threatened and then should not be unrea-
sonably withheld [784–786].
Many factors affect radiation dosage to the fetus so
advice from a radiologist should be taken. However,
very low-dose, low-resolution CT scans that fail to
answer the clinical question offer only harm without
benefit.
Statement 16.3
Ultrasound and MRI scanning are the imaging
modalities of choice for patients with IBD during

today. Surgery is required in all trimesters of pregnancy
in both ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease with nearly
half in the second trimester [777]. The literature
reflecting current practice suggests the risk of surgery to
the woman is similar to that in her nonpregnant state.
Abdominal surgery for IBD in the third trimester is
associated with almost universal precipitation of preterm
labour [777]. Surgery in the first trimester is associated
with higher rates of miscarriage prompting some to
suggest a preference for the second trimester, but no
trimester is immune from these complications [787–
790].
If surgery is required between 26 and 33 weeks’ ges-
tation and delivery is likely then there is strong evidence
that 24 h of corticosteroid administration to the woman
improves neonatal respiratory, infective and neurological
outcomes and ultimately survival without evidence of
septic harm to her [791,792]. Current recommenda-
tions extend this to 39 weeks if elective caesarean sec-
tion is planned [792]. Administration of magnesium
sulphate within 24 h of delivery between 24 and 29
(and possibly to 33) weeks’ gestation offers further fetal
neuroprotection
[792,793].
Tocolysis
(inhibition
of
uterine contractions) is associated with a prolongation
of pregnancy for only up to 7 days and is used only as a
holding measure while steroids and magnesium sulphate
take effect [792]. The maturity of the unborn fetus and
the acuteness of the maternal condition will influence
strategy.
Statement 16.4
If indicated, surgery for IBD is most commonly per-
formed in the second trimester when it may carry
least risk to the fetus in terms of miscarriage or pre-
term labour. Surgery in the third trimester is associ-
ated with very high rates of preterm labour.

 Refractory colitis
Most authors suggest that the appropriate surgical
option in unresponsive colitis is subtotal colectomy
and ileostomy [795,796,798,803–805]. The gravid
uterus
and
pelvic
and
retroperitoneal
vascular
engorgement may hinder access within the abdomen.
Bleeding is cited as a problem on mobilization of
the
colon
orrectum
from
the
retroperitoneum
[797,798]. Technical modifications such as minimal
colonic mobilization just sufficient to allow excision
of the colon and creation of an end ileostomy, uti-
lizing a ‘near colonic’ approach to the rectosigmoid,
thus avoiding pelvic retroperitoneal dissection and
utilizing the newer energy devices which cut and seal
have anecdotally proved useful.
Statement 16.6
Colectomy and ileostomy is the recommended surgi-
cal procedure for acute severe colitis during preg-
nancy.
Level of evidence: III
Grade of recommendation: GP
Consensus: 100.0% (SA 65.6%, A 34.4%)
Historically very high maternal and fetal morbidity
and
mortality
rates
were
reported
with
subtotal
colectomy for toxic megacolon in pregnancy. The
Turnbull blowhole colostomy–loop ileostomy tech-
nique is a less invasive technique which avoids haz-
ardous dissection in a vascular retroperitoneum and
avoids the difficulties of creation of a rectal stump
mucus fistula. The technique’s attraction is its sim-
plicity, but as current literature reports much lower
morbidity and mortality figures for colectomy than
30 years ago this technique has not been widely
adopted [776,797,806].
An enlarged uterus may exert pressure on the rec-
tal stump and obstructing it; this has been suggested
as a cause of rectal stump ‘blow-out’ [794]. As in
nonpregnant patients there is debate as to the role of
creation of a mucus fistula. It may be technically diffi-
cult to bring out a mucus fistula through the anterior
abdominal wall as the broad ligaments draped across
the abdominal cavity will obstruct its siting. Tun-
nelling the mucus fistula retroperitoneally across the
(dilated) ovarian and retroperitoneal vessels has been
proposed but this exposes the patient to the risk of
significant
haemorrhage
[804].
Other
strategies
include over-sewing of the rectal stump with or with-
out omental patch support [794,798]. Simple rectal
stump decompression with daily proctoscopy drainage
or use of an indwelling rectal catheter has also been
employed.
Statement 16.7
Following colectomy during pregnancy the retained
rectum may be at high risk of blow-out. Strategies
should be considered to minimize this risk. Tempo-
rary use of an indwelling rectal catheter may provide
the simplest option.
Level of evidence: IV
Grade of recommendation: D
Consensus: 90.3% (SA 41.9%, A 48.4%)
As surgery in the third trimester is universally associ-
ated with premature labour, consideration should be
given to the performance of caesarean section immedi-
ately prior to colectomy.
Fulminant Crohn’s colitis would reasonably be man-
aged similarly with the proviso that segmental involve-
ment may permit a segmental resection and colostomy
as appropriate. There are few clinical scenarios where
rectal resection could be deemed unavoidable during an
on-going pregnancy without considering simpler alter-
natives.
The use of a defunctioning ileostomy to ‘rest’ the
inflamed Crohn’s colitis during an ongoing pregnancy
has not been widely reported in the literature although
it has been instituted at the time of caesarean section
for poorly controlled disease [775]. This strategy may
be more appropriate for ‘sub-acute’ Crohn’s colitis and
be reasonably deferred until after pregnancy.
Small bowel and ileocaecal disease
Small
bowel
perforation
is
the
most
frequently
reported indication for surgery for Crohn’s disease
during pregnancy. In the presence of peritoneal sepsis,
high rates of anastomotic dehiscence after primary
anastomosis have been reported, prompting many to
advocate avoidance of an anastomosis. Significant peri-
toneal sepsis is known to adversely affect fetal out-
comes [775,799,801,807]. A recent systematic review
reports that five of six patients treated with resection
and primary anastomosis developed anastomotic leak-
age [777].
The presence of a stoma does not preclude a trial of
normal labour. Obstructive stomal complications have
been reported in the third trimester which resolve after
delivery [807–809]. Gastrointestinal bleeding and small
bowel obstruction are infrequently reported indications
for surgery during pregnancy and are managed similarly
[810,811].

Laparoscopic
abdominal
surgery
for
nonobstetric
indications has been safely performed in all trimesters of
pregnancy with many of the same advantages seen in
nonpregnant patients [812,813]. No increase in sponta-
neous abortion or miscarriage rates has been observed
with the laparoscopic technique and decreased uterine
manipulation with laparoscopy is theoretically attractive
[810,811]. A suggested upper gestational age limit of
26 to 28 weeks for laparoscopy has been challenged
[814,815].
Experience
with
laparoscopic
techniques
specifi-
cally for IBD in pregnancy is limited, with only a
few authors reporting experience of this technique
[810,816]. Patient positioning, care with port place-
ment and insufflation pressures kept to a minimum
(10–15 mmHg) are important. Fetal acidosis with
CO2 insufflation has been observed in animal models
so maternal end tidal CO2 monitoring as a reflection
of acid–base status should be continually monitored
[817]. Pregnancy is a prothrombotic state, and as in
all IBD surgery appropriate prophylaxis for deep vein
thrombosis
should
be
undertaken
[818].
If
addi-
tional individual risk factors exist, including the need
for caesarean section, then extended thromboembolic
prophylaxis from 28 weeks to 6 weeks postpartum is
recommended [819]. A pragmatic surgeon will con-
sider the stage of pregnancy and the challenges it
brings, the surgery required and the skill mix of
the surgical team when considering a laparoscopic
approach.
There is little published literature on the use of
interventional radiological techniques for the drainage
of
sepsis
in
pregnancy,
and
what
is
available
has
shown disappointing results [820]. Over recent years
there has been significant growth in the use of inter-
ventional radiological techniques in general with up-
skilling
of
interventional
radiological
teams.
These
techniques may allow deferral of surgery until a more
favourable time in a pregnancy [777]. A futile radio-
logical intervention can also introduce harmful delay
and the clinician must set clear achievable objectives
with regular clinical review.
Statement 16.9
Interventional radiological techniques in pregnant
patients with IBD are currently unproven but may
optimize sepsis control and allow deferral of surgery
until a more favourable time.

Perianal Crohn’s disease
The presence of perianal Crohn’s disease may impact on
the mode of delivery and is covered in Section 17.
There are no data specific to the surgical management
of active perianal Crohn’s sepsis during pregnancy. Sep-
sis, however, is known to have a negative impact on
pregnancy and so emphasis should be placed on expedi-
tious control of perianal sepsis, delaying any more
definitive procedures until the puerperium.
IBD stomas during pregnancy
IBD patients with preexisting stomas may safely carry
a pregnancy to term [821,822], although this situa-
tion is probably worthy of further research [823].
Some changes to stoma anatomy and function may be
experienced during the course of a pregnancy, with
the greatest change occurring in the third trimester
[821]. Patients may report flattening or even retrac-
tion of the stoma, which is usually amenable to cor-
rection
with
advice
from
a
stoma
therapist
about
change in stoma appliance [821]. As in all women,
the gravid uterus may exert a pressure effect on the
colon,
resulting
in
symptoms
of
constipation
and
altered bowel function during the latter stages of
pregnancy. There are a small number of reported cases
of intestinal obstruction during pregnancy in patients
with preexisting stomas, with adhesional obstruction
and pressure effects being the most common causes
[809,822,824].
Inflammatory Bowel Disease patients with an ileost-
omy who experience hyperemesis gravidarum are at par-
ticularly high risk of dehydration, renal failure and
metabolic derangement. Admission for anti-emetics and
rehydration may occasionally be required [825].
While
most
stoma
changes
experienced
during
pregnancy usually revert with a few weeks of delivery,
postpartum changes in the abdominal wall and skin
laxity may result in problems with postpartum fitting
of stoma appliances [821]. The increased abdominal

of
pregnancy
may
also
predispose

 development of parastomal hernia in some patients,
although the literature does not suggest that this is a
significant risk [826,827].
Summary
In summary, the literature has shown a step change in
improved outcomes for both the woman and the fetus
over the last 30 years. The published literature on IBD
surgery during pregnancy is limited to case reports and
small case series but a degree of consensus regarding
technique may be reached. A central repository of surgi-
cal patient episodes in this group of patients may help
develop our understanding further.
Modes of delivery in pregnant women
with IBD
Mode of delivery is a common dilemma and a frequently
asked question from patients with IBD. This is due to
the obvious fact that the disease is most frequently diag-
nosed in women during their peak reproductive years.
Although many studies have reported on the outcomes
for neonates born to women with IBD there are very
few that have focused on the indications for, or compli-
cations of, different modes of delivery. Of those studies
that are available for analysis many combine Crohn’s dis-
ease and ulcerative colitis patients together and the indi-
cations for, and modes of, delivery are rarely well
described. In addition, there are confounding variables
over and above the specific disease process that influence
mode of delivery. Pregnant women, especially those with
Crohn’s disease, have a lower BMI than age-matched
pregnant controls and are more likely to be smokers
[828]. Approximately 30–40% of women with IBD
active at the time of conception will develop flare-ups
during pregnancy [761,829] and may be more likely to
undergo premature labour with its attendant obstetric
priorities regarding mode of delivery and potential for
complications for the woman and her baby.
With the above limitations, the following conclusions
and recommendations are presented, together with the
level of evidence on which the recommendations are
made.
Vaginal delivery
Risk of perineal tearing
A Swedish population-based study of over 12 000
women (1209 women with ulcerative colitis and 787
with Crohn’s disease) who gave birth to over 13 000
singletons showed that there was no increase in the risk
of vaginal tears in women with either Crohn’s disease
or ulcerative colitis undergoing vaginal delivery [828].
Indeed, the risk for a grade 3 or 4 perineal tear was less
than the risk in the non-IBD group (OR 0.68, 0.47–
0.98). This presumably relates to the higher rate of
planned caesarean section in these groups (see below).
The situation may be different for perianal Crohn’s
disease. A population study of over 6.7 million pregnant
women [830] showed that there was a significant
increase in risk of fourth-degree tears in this subgroup
undergoing vaginal delivery. The rate of fourth-degree
tears was 12.3% in women with perianal Crohn’s dis-
ease, 1.4% in women with luminal-only Crohn’s disease
and 1.3% in other women (OR 10.9, 8.3–4.1). A much
smaller study by Smink et al. showed that 2/27 women
with perianal Crohn’s disease and 14/87 with luminal
disease only suffered a second-degree tear with no
third- or fourth-degree tears in either group [831].
Statement 17.1.
Women with IBD, excluding those with perianal
Crohn’s disease, do not appear to have an increased
risk of perineal tearing during vaginal delivery.
Level of evidence: II
Grade of recommendation: C
Consensus: 96.8% (SA 35.5%, A 61.3%)
Risk of episiotomy
There are very few studies reporting specifically on
either the indications for, or outcomes of, episiotomy in
women with IBD. Many studies do, however, make
some comments about various factors related to the
subgroups of IBD patients who undergo episiotomy. A
Cochrane Review on episiotomy concluded that epi-
siotomy should only be recommended for obstetric rea-
sons and not as routine practice [832]. In the light of
this, many units have become more conservative with
regard to episiotomy over the last decade.
The study by Smink et al. [831] reported that 9/27
women
with
perianal
Crohn’s
disease
and
43/87
women with only luminal Crohn’s underwent epi-
siotomy for delivery. The indications for episiotomy
were not detailed. The outcomes of these patients at
2 years were analysed in conjunction with those for
patients who sustained perineal tears, which confounds
the conclusions. However, it was shown that 6/11
(55%) women who had an episiotomy, who also had
pre-existing perianal Crohn’s, had progressive perianal
Crohn’s at 2 years, including two women who had
developed a fistula. Similarly, 32/57 (56%) women who
had either had an episiotomy or a tear and had luminal-
only disease at the time of delivery, had progressive

 perianal Crohn’s at 2 years, including three fistulas. In
the nine women with perianal Crohn’s disease who had
neither an episiotomy nor a tear, seven reported pro-
gression in disease activity at 2 years but without fistula
formation.
Brandt et al. [833] reported on 117 women with
Crohn’s disease who had undergone vaginal delivery
with or without episiotomy and found that the latter
predisposed to development of postpartum perianal
problems even in those with no perianal problems
before delivery.
The data for ulcerative colitis are even more limited.
In those with an IPAA it is clearly essential that trauma
to the sphincters is avoided. Many would recommend
that such patients undergo a caesarean section to avoid
the potential for trauma (see below), but in the situa-
tion where a vaginal delivery is planned episiotomy
should be dictated by the obstetric indications.
Statement 17.2.
Episiotomy should only be performed if indicated
for obstetric reasons in women with Crohn’s disease
as it may predispose to unmasking or worsening of
perianal disease.

Consensus: 81.3% (SA 40.6%, A 40.6%)
Risk of faecal incontinence
The link between perineal tears and subsequent impair-
ment of faecal continence has long been established
[834]. However, most studies include mainly women
without IBD. The studies of women with IBD often
analyse ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease together.
A survey by Broms et al. [828] of 10 000 patients
with IBD reported no association between faecal incon-
tinence and vaginal delivery in women with IBD. Con-
versely a smaller survey of 777 IBD patients by Ong
et al. [835] showed an increased rate of faecal inconti-
nence among women with IBD.
Statement 17.3.
Vaginal delivery does not appear to increase the
overall risk of faecal incontinence in women with
IBD. As with
all decisions
about management,
women should be counselled about the risks and
benefits of different modes of delivery.

Other risks of vaginal delivery in Crohn’s disease
Premature rupture of membranes. A large multicentre
study of over 4.2 million deliveries in the USA showed
no evidence of premature rupture of membranes in
women with Crohn’s disease or ulcerative colitis [836].
Instrumental vaginal delivery. The study by Broms
et al. [828] did not demonstrate any increase in the risk
of instrumental vaginal delivery for women with IBD
compared with non-IBD controls.
Induction of labour. The study by Br€
oms et al. [828]
did not demonstrate any increase in the risk of induc-
tion of labour for women with IBD compared with
non-IBD controls.
Caesarean section
Likelihood of undergoing caesarean section in women
with IBD
The ECCO consensus paper on reproduction and preg-
nancy in IBD [837] states that caesarean delivery is
more frequent in women with IBD. The paper was pro-
duced through combined systematic literature review
and discussions among the expert group chaired by the
senior author. These findings are almost universal in
each of the studies that have examined this association
[831,836,838–844].
A study of approximately 4.2 million deliveries in the
USA demonstrated that there was a higher rate of cae-
sarean section in women with Crohn’s disease compared
with those without IBD (45.9% vs 30.9%, P < 0.0001,
OR 1.72) [836]. Although this is a large population-
based study, it only considered deliveries in hospital.
Planned
home
births,
which
are
disproportionately
offered to very low risk women, and unplanned out of
hospital
births,
which
are
disproportionately
found
amongst uninsured patients, may have confounded the
findings in this study.
The huge population-based study of over 6.7 million
pregnant women by Hatch et al. [830] also confirmed
that the rates of caesarean section were significantly
higher in women with Crohn’s disease compared to the
general population. Only 2882 of the women in this
study had Crohn’s and the rates of caesarean section
were higher for these women than for those without
Crohn’s. Furthermore 83.1% of women with perianal
Crohn’s had caesarean section compared with 42.8% of
those with luminal Crohn’s only. The rates for non-
Crohn’s women in this study were 38.9% for women
without Crohn’s and 25.6% for women without any
form of perianal disease (P < 0.001).

 A meta-analysis of over 3000 women with IBD (64%
with Crohn’s disease) by Cornish et al. [843] showed
that women with Crohn’s disease are 1.65 times more
likely to undergo caesarean section. However, this study
did not look at the risk factors for undergoing caesarean
section, nor perform any subgroup analysis.
A single-centre Dutch study of 114 women with
Crohn’s disease who underwent one or more singleton
pregnancies during the time of the study showed that
there was an increased risk of caesarean section in
women with both luminal and perianal Crohn’s [831].
The overall caesarean section rate was relatively high at
32% compared with the general caesarean rate in the
Netherlands which stands at 13.6%, Women with peri-
anal disease had the highest rate of caesarean section
with an OR of 4.6 (1.8–11.4).
Similarly, the study from Manitoba by Ilnyckji et al.
[839] showed that women with IBD (both Crohn’s dis-
ease and ulcerative colitis) had a higher rate of undergo-
ing caesarean section than non-IBD women (20.9% for
women with Crohn’s, 20.8% for women with ulcerative
colitis, 15% for non-IBD women; P < 0.01).
The most recent study is a 10-year retrospective sin-
gle-centre cohort study comparing 59 patients with
Crohn’s and 65 patients with ulcerative colitis with
21 805 women without IBD. They found the likeli-
hood of caesarean section to be the same as in the gen-
eral population for Crohn’s but was double the general
population value in the ulcerative colitis group, with the
highest incidence being in those with an IPAA [844].
Although multiple studies confirm the association
between IBD and caesarean section, there is very little
evidence about the reasons for this. Due to method-
ological variance in both the individual studies above
and in the systematic reviews and meta-analyses it is dif-
ficult to draw robust conclusions. It is, however, reason-
able to conclude that the reasons are multifactorial and
include the presence or risk of perianal Crohn’s disease,
fetal growth problems due to maternal ill health and
smoking-related factors. There are other confounding
factors such as the level of medical insurance in the
USA and similar healthcare systems, and the more
detailed antenatal monitoring that women with IBD
undergo.
An interesting study by Selinger et al. [845] sur-
veyed the views of 145 women with IBD with regard to
their attitudes to various aspects of fertility, pregnancy
and delivery. Over 75% of participants agreed that
women with IBD are more likely to have a vaginal
delivery (irrespective of participant knowledge scores)
and approximately 68% expected to have a healthy baby.
This small study would seem to indicate that there is
not a widespread expectation of elective caesarean sec-
tion among IBD specialists and patients.
Statement 17.4.
There is an increased likelihood of women with both
ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease undergoing
caesarean section.
Level of evidence: II
Grade of recommendation: B
Consensus: 90.3% (SA 41.9%, A 48.4%)
Potential for harm after caesarean section
There is an increased rate of complications after caesarean
section in both ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease. The
study by Broms et al. [828] showed that the risk of com-
plications after elective caesarean was doubled among
women with both ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s. This
clearly should be taken into account before recommend-
ing caesarean section in all IBD patients.
Mode of delivery after surgery for ulcerative colitis
There is very little evidence to dictate the mode of
delivery in patients after surgery for ulcerative colitis.
The ECCO guidelines recommend the presence of an
ileoanal pouch to be a relative indication for caesarean
section [837]. This is based on the assumption that
such a patient is borderline incontinent and any risk at
all to the anal sphincter will severely affect function.
However, a questionnaire administered to 232 pregnant
women with a pouch reported no difference in the rates
of pouch-related complications or functional problems
after vaginal or caesarean delivery [846]. A recent sys-
tematic review reached the conclusion that uncompli-
cated vaginal delivery only moderately influenced pouch
function, with no significant difference in overall conti-
nence or stool frequency. Nevertheless, function was
significantly worsened in a complicated delivery, perhaps
still justifying an elective caesarean in these patients
[847].
Regarding patients who have an ileorectal anastomo-
sis, there is clearly intact rectal function and patients
may not be so ‘borderline incontinent’. However, the
risks of recurrent disease and further surgery are high
(see Section 7). Indeed, the same argument could be
used for those with an intact colon, one in five of whim
will need surgery in their lifetimes (see Section 4).
Counselling patients with regard to mode of delivery
can only be individualized based on risks of surgery and
patient preferences.

Mode of delivery in women with perianal Crohn’s
disease
Although there is no evidence to recommend the use of
elective caesarean section in women with Crohn’s dis-
ease generally, there is some evidence to promote its
use amongst women with active perianal Crohn’s. The
Toronto Guidelines [848] and the ECCO guidelines
[837] make a statement to this effect, although they
admit that this is a recommendation made on low-qual-
ity evidence.
Most of the justification for recommending caesarean
section comes from the large population-based study
indicating an increased risk of fourth-degree tears in
these patients [830]. Other evidence comes from studies
(mentioned above) suggesting that progressive perianal
disease occurs after episiotomy (5,7). Other studies sug-
gest there may be worsening of perianal disease after
vaginal delivery, even without a tear or episiotomy [841].
One small study even suggests that vaginal delivery may
predispose to perineal involvement in women with lumi-
nal Crohn’s [833]. In this particular questionnaire study
of 117 women with Crohn’s disease, 67.6% of those with
no pre-existing perianal disease went on to develop dis-
ease, 60% within 2 months of vaginal delivery.
However, the protective effect of caesarean section in
avoiding progression of perianal Crohn’s disease has
been questioned by other studies. A small study by
Rogers and Katz [849] showed that three out of four
women who underwent elective caesarean due to active
perianal Crohn’s disease at the time of delivery went on
to develop progressive perianal Crohn’s, with one also
developing a fistula in the caesarean wound. However,
these results may have been confounded by the indica-
tions for caesarean section, which may have been per-
formed in a higher-risk group. A single-centre study by
Cheng et al. also questioned the protective effect of
caesarean section on the relapse of perianal Crohn’s dis-
ease after childbirth [850]. Pregnant and nonpregnant
women with perianal Crohn’s (61 in each group) were
compared – approximately 36% of women had a relapse
of perianal Crohn’s within 1 year and this was not sig-
nificantly different between those who had caesarean
section or vaginal delivery or between pregnant and
nonpregnant women. Another study of 121 Crohn’s
patients showed no association with mode of delivery
and progression of disease [851].
A recent meta-analysis of the available evidence
suggests that for new or recurrent perianal Crohn’s
disease there is no increase associated with mode of
delivery [847]. However, for patients with active dis-
ease, worsening of symptoms was noted in two-thirds
of cases. Pending further data from well-designed tri-
als, the suggestion is that systematic Caesarean section

Statement 17.6
Pregnant women with active perianal Crohn’s dis-
ease should be offered elective caesarean section due
to the risk of worsening symptoms and progressive
disease.

Consensus: 91.2% (SA 41.2%, A 50.0%)
Summary
The overall evidence for mode of delivery in IBD is
weak. The emphasis remains on recommending shared
decision-making between surgeons, obstetricians, gas-
troenterologists and patients. Discussions should involve
patient preferences along with the current evidence,
stressing the uncertainty that exists.
Impact of medication on surgery for IBD
With the advent of disease-modifying therapy, surgical
practice in the management of IBD is in the midst of a
revolution.
Traditional
indications
and
surgical
approaches are being challenged by the rapidly evolving
advances in medical therapy and the increasing number
of options in the medical armamentarium. The transi-
tion
from
the
mainstay
of
corticosteroid
therapy
through to immunosuppressants, calcineurin inhibitors
and the widespread introduction of biological therapy
has recently been turned on its head with the introduc-
tion of ‘top-down’ aggressive medical approaches aimed
at early disease control using agents targeting specific
immune components. These novel medical approaches
are rapidly evolving, with major new studies being pub-
lished annually. Increasingly, biological agents are used
as first-line therapy. Surgical practice has already been
profoundly affected by this paradigm shift in medical
management.

IBD Surgical Guidelines
 This brief review addresses the specific theme of the
impact of current medical therapy on IBD surgical prac-
tice, on operative outcomes and attempts to synthesize
guidelines for current surgical practice. This guidance is
based on the current status of available evidence with
respect to biological agents, but the evidence is some-
what more mature for corticosteroids, immunosuppres-
sants and calcineurin antagonists, given the longer time
available for observation of complications. However, it
should be noted that there is no Level 1 evidence con-
tributing to these recommendations, given that all stud-
ies of surgical outcomes following treatment are, by
their nature, observational and complications are highly
co-linear with disease severity.
Medication impacts on surgical practice both directly
and indirectly, dependent on clinical circumstances.
Firstly,
the need
for
surgical
intervention
may be
avoided altogether, or delayed, by medical rescue in the
acute phase, or through improved maintenance therapy
comprising more effective and/or aggressive medical
therapies. There is some circumstantial evidence that
control of mucosal inflammation has the potential to
reduce long-term disease-related complications such as
cancer risk and stricturing. Secondly, medical therapy
influences the nature of operative intervention. This is
due to the growing expectation of successful control of
medical symptoms and disease activity, thus ameliorat-
ing the magnitude of the required surgery or com-
pletely altering overall surgical strategy. Medication may
also
have
an
indirect
impact
on
surgical
practice
through effects on the frequency and/or severity of
postoperative complications, such as surgical site infec-
tion and anastomotic leak.
Beneficial impact of medical therapy on surgical
management and outcomes
Grouping Crohn’s disease with ulcerative colitis as a
common entity, namely IBD, is unhelpful when consid-
ering the impact of medications on surgical practice.
The surgical issues are very different between the two
conditions and so they are considered separately here.
While not the remit of this brief guidance, it is clear
that there is now demonstrable evidence that biological
therapy has proven efficacy in the induction and mainte-
nance of remission of both Crohn’s disease and ulcera-
tive
colitis
[852–855].
Anti-TNF
and
anti-integrin
biologicals are effective in inducing mucosal healing of
ulcerative colitis, with adalimumab being somewhat
inferior. Biological agents are also of proven benefit in
the management of Crohn’s disease. However, it should
be noted that there is a well-established placebo effect
[856]. Furthermore, the absolute reduction in risk of
colectomy is small [855]. Hence, it is essential that sur-
geons maintain a central role in the management of
IBD patients.
Crohn’s disease – beneficial impact on risk of relapse
and nature of primary operation
For luminal disease, the frequency of clinical or signifi-
cant endoscopic recurrence is highly heterogeneous in
published studies, ranging from 13% to 36% without
treatment, 22% to 56% with thiopurines and 0% to 9%
with anti-TNF therapy at 1 year. This heterogeneity
undermines the strength of evidence supporting any
recommendations. However, a number of studies indi-
cate a lower requirement for stoma and improved sal-
vage of ileorectal anastomoses with biological agents in
Crohn’s
disease.
A
descriptive
retrospective
cohort
study conducted by Coscia et al. [857] compared two
temporally
distinct
patient
cohorts
with
colonic
Crohn’s disease differing in the frequency of biological
therapy use: a historical time-period when biologicals
were not used and a more recent period when they
were used frequently. The authors found that the pro-
portions of patients having a permanent stoma were
respectively 61 and 19%. Univariate and multivariate
analysis suggested that biologicals were associated with
an
increased
frequency
of
rectal
preservation.
The
authors concluded that the risk of permanent stoma in
patients with Crohn’s colitis and anorectal involvement
is significantly reduced with combined surgical and bio-
logical treatment. However, these conclusions should
be taken with some circumspection, given that the his-
torical
surgical
approach
to
Crohn’s
disease
with
anorectal involvement was routinely proctocolectomy.
It may be that more patients had a staged colectomy
and temporary ileostomy in the more recent cohort
because there was an option available of additional
therapy rather than necessarily because it was effective.
Furthermore, it should be noted that the duration of
follow-up for the historical group was, by nature, much
longer than for the patient cohort treated with biologi-
cal therapy. It will be of interest to determine if the
natural history of anorectal Crohn’s unfolds over time.
Nonetheless, these results are encouraging and suggest
that intensive biological therapy may enable a staged
approach, avoiding, or at least delaying, excision of the
anorectum. Another time period [858] found that for
patients treated more intensively with drug combina-
tions the time interval from initial diagnosis to surgery
was greater than patients who did not receive such
therapy. However, interestingly, there appeared to be
no influence of preoperative medical therapy on the
magnitude of surgery, at least using the surrogate mea-
sure of bowel length resected.

 One recent systematic review [859] failed to find evi-
dence that thiopurine therapy reduced postoperative
recurrence
rate.
However,
there
was
encouraging,
though heterogeneous, evidence that anti-TNF therapy
reduces postoperative recurrence. Similarly, Carla-Mor-
eau et al. [860] conducted a meta-analysis of nine con-
trolled trials incorporating data from 362 randomized
patients to assess the efficacy of anti-TNF therapy in
preventing or treating postoperative recurrence of lumi-
nal Crohn’s disease. There was evidence that anti-TNF
was effective at preventing endoscopic (OR: 0.05, 95%
CI: 0.02–0.13) and clinical recurrence (OR: 0.10, 95%
CI: 0.05–0.21). Interestingly, the number needed to
treat to prevent one case was only 2.4, quite a remark-
able effect size, thereby supporting the expectation that
individual patients are highly likely to benefit. Further-
more, if endoscopic postoperative recurrence did arise,
anti-TNF therapy was still an effective treatment (OR:
16.64, 95% CI: 2.51–110.27). A more recent meta-ana-
lysis incorporating data from 673 patients suggests that
complete mucosal healing is a useful surrogate for long-
term clinical remission and thus a valuable therapeutic
target when considering the timing of surgical interven-
tion [861]. Furthermore, a retrospective comparison
between adalimumab and infliximab for a cohort under-
going ileocaecal resection suggests that both anti-TNF
agents are of similar efficacy in reducing endoscopic
recurrence at least [862].
Ulcerative colitis – beneficial impact of medication on
disease control, cancer risk and nature of operation
Medical therapy is aimed at reducing disease activity
and avoiding the need for surgical resection. Several tri-
als and systematic reviews have shown a beneficial
impact for biological therapy [852,855]. However, it is
important to note that, whilst statistically significant,
the absolute benefit over placebo is modest and the pre-
dominant effect in trials is for patients with relatively
restricted disease. For instance, in the ACT trials there
was only a modest absolute difference (7%) in favour of
infliximab over placebo in the frequency of colectomy
in the treated group [854]. Hence, it is essential that
surgeons remain an integral part of the team contribut-
ing to the coordinated management of patients with
IBD. Apart from reducing and/or delaying the need for
colectomy, there is no current evidence that modern
medical management influences the nature or the mag-
nitude
of
surgical
resection
for
ulcerative
colitis.
Nonetheless, it may be feasible that colectomy and ileo-
rectal anastomosis once again have a place in the man-
agement of ulcerative colitis (see Section 6).
There is some circumstantial evidence that colorectal
cancer risk may be reduced as a consequence of disease-
modifying agents and so this may have an impact on
surveillance protocols [863]. Previous evidence has sug-
gested an excess risk of haematological malignancy asso-
ciated with immunosuppressant therapy in IBD, but
concerns about an excess cancer risk with biologicals
have not materialized. A recent analysis of SEER data
for paediatric IBD patients showed no excess risk of
malignancy with infliximab therapy [864]. Furthermore,
initial reports suggesting an association between biolog-
ical therapy and an increased skin cancer risk, especially
melanoma, have not been substantiated. A recent meta-
analysis suggests that IBD itself is associated with an
increased risk of skin cancer and that the effect is inde-
pendent of treatment with biological therapy [865].
Adverse impact of medical therapy on surgical
outcomes in IBD
Crohn’s disease – influence of corticosteroids on the risk
of postoperative complications
The evidence is well established that corticosteroid ther-
apy is associated with an increased risk of postoperative
complications in both Crohn’s disease and ulcerative
colitis [293,866]. Prednisolone therapy of 20 mg/day
(or equivalent) for 6 or more weeks has been conclu-
sively shown to be associated with a substantial increase
in the postoperative complication rate. However, given
that steroid therapy and higher dose is associated with
disease activity, and there are no data from trials of ster-
oid therapy, it is not possible to disentangle the effect of
steroid therapy from disease activity itself. In a large sys-
tematic review and meta-analysis of all available observa-
tional studies, Subramanian et al. [295] estimated a 40%
excess risk of all complications (OR 1.41) and specifi-
cally an increase in risk of infections (OR 1.68) among
patients treated with steroids. There is some evidence to
suggest a threshold for total dose of steroid-associated
complications [867] and other evidence suggests a
dose–response effect, with patients on > 40 mg/day
having an even greater risk of all complications (OR
2.04). In a recent large observational study, Nguyen and
colleagues [868] used the American College of Surgeons
National Surgical Quality Improvement Program to
explore the effect of preoperative corticosteroid use on
postoperative complication risks. They found that ster-
oid therapy was associated with a greater complication
frequency in both Crohn’s (adjusted OR 1.26) and
ulcerative colitis (adjusted OR 1.44). Infectious compli-
cations were more frequent with steroid use in IBD
overall, but there was also an association with increased
risk of venous thromboembolism in both Crohn’s dis-
ease (OR 1.66) and ulcerative colitis (OR 2.66). Whilst
there

evidence

implicate

 corticosteroids in the observed association with an excess
risk of complications, it is reasonable to recommend
reduction in dose wherever possible in the preoperative
period. A pragmatic level of 20 mg/day of prednisolone
or equivalent has been suggested, but the lower the dose
the better and an attempt to reduce to < 10 mg/day for
more than 2 weeks prior to surgery seems appropriate
(see Sections 3 and 4).

Corticosteroid therapy increases the risk of postoper-
ative complications in patients with Crohn’s disease.
Wherever
possible,

reduction
should
be

tainly below 20 mg/day for prednisolone but prefer-
ably below 10 mg/day.

Biological
therapy
and
risk
of
postoperative
complications in Crohn’s disease
Biological therapy (anti-TNF, anti-integrin, anti-IL12/
23) is now incorporated as the standard of care for esca-
lation of medical therapy in the management of IBD.
However, it is well established that biological therapy,
and anti-TNF therapy in particular, is associated with an
increased risk of infection in patients with rheumatoid
arthritis [869]. These observations provide the rationale
for studying the frequency of postoperative infections in
IBD patients treated with biological agents over and, in
particular, in the perioperative period.
There remains a lack of unanimity over whether bio-
logical therapy influences the postoperative complication
rate in Crohn’s disease. Various observational studies
show conflicting results from subgroup analyses of trials
of biologicals. However, overall, it does seem as though
anti-TNF therapy is associated with an increase in infec-
tive complication rates. It should be noted that all of
the evidence is observational and so there is no Level 1
and limited Level 2 evidence to support any recommen-
dations.
Waterman et al. [870] found no impact of infliximab
or adalimumab therapy alone on the overall frequency
of postoperative complications or the timing of surgery
to treatment cessation. However, in patients treated
with combined biological and thiopurine therapy, there
was an association with greater overall risk of postopera-
tive infective complications. In contrast, several other
studies failed to demonstrate an association between
overall postoperative infections or anastomotic leakage
rate and up to a 12-week interval between surgery and
the preceding infliximab administration [293,866,871–
876]. A more recent systematic review and meta-analysis
and the most recent nationwide prospective cohort
study conclude that preoperative use of infliximab does
increase the risk of early postoperative complications
overall, particularly for infection, in patients undergoing
surgery for Crohn’s disease [877,878], but even these
data
are
contradicted
by
another
contemporaneous
meta-analysis showing no effect [874] and a recent large
retrospective cohort study [879].
Given the more recent introduction of anti-integrin
therapy, data on the effect of these agents on risk of
postoperative complications are even more sparse than
for anti-TNF agents. One retrospective observational
study suggested a higher postoperative infection rate
[880], with 37% of IBD patients receiving vedolizu-
mab within 30 days preceding major abdominal sur-
gery developing a postoperative infective complication.
This
excess
risk
was
significantly
higher
than
for
patients receiving anti-TNF or no biological therapy.
Further work by the same group suggested that 26%
of patients treated with vedolizumab within 12 weeks
of major abdominal surgery suffered surgical site infec-
tion, with vedolizumab treatment being an indepen-
dent predictor of infectious complication, although
vedoluzimab
was
probably
being
used
in
a
sicker
patient population as significantly more patients in this
group had end stomas formed during surgery [881].
However, in contrast, Colombel et al. found no signif-
icant excess risk of serious infections or overall compli-
cation rates for IBD patients treated with vedolizumab
compared with placebo in the GEMINI trials [882].
Similarly, use of propensity score matching to analyse
cohort data did not demonstrate any excess risk of
infectious
complications
with
vedoluzimab
[879].
There are minimal data on infectious risk with ustek-
inumab. A small retrospective study has shown that
the 30-day infectious complication rate after abdominal
surgery for Crohn’s disease in patients who received
ustekinumab within 12 weeks prior to surgery was
13%, not dissimilar from patients who received anti-
TNF therapy [883].
The time interval preceding surgery over which
biological agents might exert an effect on risk remains
very unclear. However, given a half-life for infliximab
of 7–18 days, if clinical circumstances allow, a 14–30-
day washout period free of biological agent prior to
surgery would seem reasonable and achievable. A simi-
lar wash-out period of up to 12 weeks if possible
would seem reasonable for patients treated with anti-
integrin therapy, but again the available evidence is
limited to appraise any effect on perioperative infec-
tion risk.

 Statement 18.2.
Where clinical circumstances permit, anti-TNFa and
anti-integrin therapy should probably not be admin-
istered for at least 14–30 days prior to any planned
elective surgery for Crohn’s disease to minimize the
risk of infective complications and perhaps anasto-
motic leakage, but evidence in this area is poor.

Impact
of
biological
therapy
on
postoperative
complications in ulcerative colitis
As discussed for Crohn’s disease, the evidence is conflict-
ing as to whether there is an excess risk of postoperative
complications for patients treated with biological agents
such as infliximab. As with Crohn’s, high-quality evidence
is lacking due to the fact that disease severity and the need
for therapy are highly correlated. One study examined the
effect of biological agents on the risk of postoperative
complications after restorative proctocolectomy for ulcer-
ative colitis [884]. The authors found a 3.5-fold excess
risk of early postoperative complications for patients trea-
ted with infliximab, whilst the odds of sepsis were 13.8
times greater. However, it should be noted that again the
disease severity is likely to be correlated with the need for
biological therapy. Nonetheless, the authors found an
excess complication rate even for those patients undergo-
ing a three-stage ileoanal pouch reconstruction. In
another large institutional observational study, ulcerative
colitis patients treated with infliximab prior to ileoanal
pouch
reconstruction
experienced
a
substantially
increased risk of postoperative pouch-related and infec-
tious complications [885]. A systematic review by Yang
et al. [886] also suggested that preoperative infliximab
therapy was indeed associated with an increased risk of
short-term postoperative complications and there was a
trend towards increased postoperative infection.
Similarly, a recent meta-analysis [875] found that anti-
TNF therapy but not anti-integrin therapy was associated
with a greater infection risk than placebo in ulcerative
colitis. In contrast, Lightner et al. [880] reported an
excess of septic complications in patients treated with
vedolizumab compared with infliximab or no biological
therapy. To add further to this controversy, a recent
paper by Yamada et al. [879] found no excess risk of 30-
day postoperative complications in ulcerative colitis and
Crohn’s
associated
with
preoperative
vedolizumab
exposure. In summary, it remains unclear whether anti-
integrin therapy has an adverse impact on surgical com-
plications or whether the need for therapy is in itself
merely a biomarker of disease severity, and it is that which
imparts the risk of infectious and overall complications.
Statement 18.3.
Where clinical circumstances permit, anti-TNFa and
anti-integrin therapy should be discontinued for 14–
30 days prior to planned elective surgery for ulcera-
tive colitis, but evidence in this area is poor.
Level of evidence: III
Grade of recommendation: C
Consensus: 86.7% (SA 40.0%, A 46.7%)
Potential adverse effects of other agents
As with all the above agents, there are conflicting data
on the role of various other agents used in the standard
management of IBD. Whilst some large studies suggest
that there is no excess risk of complications with thiop-
urine therapy [887], other studies contradict these
observations [888], particularly when in combination
with other immunomodulatory therapy [870]. In clinical
practice, it is often not possible to withdraw both thera-
pies and so, along with the imprecise estimation of risk,
it is not feasible to offer clear guidance on the with-
drawal of combined therapy as a requirement for sur-
gery. However, the above guidance on infliximab alone
would seem appropriate. There is no published evidence
that the calcineurin antagonists (cyclosporin, tacrolimus)
are associated with postsurgical complications. However,
the fact these agents are used as second-line salvage ther-
apy for patients with acute severe ulcerative colitis means
that it is impossible to disentangle the relative contribu-
tion of disease severity from drug-associated risk.
Long term effect of medications
This section has concentrated on short-term complica-
tions related to medication. There is also an effect of
medication on long-term outcomes after abdominal
surgery for IBD, and in particular the risk of develop-
ment of incisional hernia. Incisional hernias may have a
significant impact on a patient’s quality of life as well
as making reoperative surgery (relatively common in
IBD) more complex. Steroids and other immunomodu-
latory drugs have been shown to be a substantial risk
factor for hernia development [889]. Repair may be
difficult and further compromised by continued medi-
cation. For methods of abdominal surgical incision clo-
sure in these patients and the role of prophylactic mesh
please refer to the European Hernia Society guidelines
[890] and results from the PRImary Mesh Closure of
Abdominal Midline Wound (PRIMA) trial [891].

 Summary
The revolution in medical therapy for IBD will continue
to impact on the surgical management of IBD. The
strong correlation between escalating medical therapy
and disease severity makes it impossible to disentangle
the relative contribution of each to the high complica-
tion rates of surgery for IBD in the acute phase. It is
also increasingly difficult to define, or even test, which
medication is responsible as more and more sequential
therapies are introduced and combination therapies are
proposed for rescue with anti-TNF induction followed
by rapid introduction of anti-integrin therapy. Given all
of the above it is important that ongoing careful and
comprehensive audit of all IBD patients treated with
immunomodulatory therapy is an integral part of the
management. There are excellent database resources in
the UK (http://ibdregistry.org.uk/) [73] and the USA
[892] and it is incumbent on all centres to ascertain all
instances of treatment and also ensure comprehensive
capture of surgical outcomes, including complications.

Standard
