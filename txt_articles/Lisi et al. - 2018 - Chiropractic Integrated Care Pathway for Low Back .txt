 recommendations. Veterans Affairs-based panelists (n = 58) evaluated the pathway via e-mail 
using a modified RAND/UCLA methodology. Consensus was defined as agreement by 80% of 
panelists.
Results—The modified Delphi process was conducted in July to December 2016. Most (93%) 
seed statements achieved consensus during the first round, with all statements reaching consensus 
after 2 rounds. The final care pathway addressed the topics of informed consent, clinical 
evaluation including history and examination, screening for red flags, documentation, diagnostic 
imaging, patient-reported outcomes, adverse event reporting, chiropractic treatment frequency and 
duration standards, tailored approaches to chiropractic care in veteran populations, and clinical 
presentation of common mental health conditions. Care algorithms outlined chiropractic case 
management and interprofessional collaboration and referrals between doctors of chiropractic and 
primary care and mental health providers.
Conclusion—This study offers an integrative care pathway that includes chiropractic care for 
veterans with low back pain.

Introduction
Of the 5.7 million patients served annually in Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) facilities, 
more than half experience chronic pain.1 Much of the chronic pain reported by veterans is 
musculoskeletal (MSK) pain,2–8 with around 25% consistently reporting low back pain 
(LBP).7 The prevalence of severe pain is more common in veterans with LBP than in 
nonveterans.9 Coincident with MSK pain, many veterans are diagnosed with mental health 
conditions, such as depression, anxiety, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and substance 
use disorders.8 Veterans with MSK pain and mental health comorbidity use more VA health 
care services than veterans without these conditions, including primary care, medical 
specialty, chronic pain, and behavioral health services.10
The widely accepted biopsychosocial model postulates that physical disease, mental health 
or illness, and social factors interact and contribute to the patient’s overall suffering and 
experience of chronic pain.11–14 Clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) and systematic reviews 
recommend that clinicians incorporate biopsychosocial approaches into the management of 
patients with LBP, including effective nonpharmacological therapies such as patient 
education, activity/exercise, yoga, massage, acupuncture, and spinal manipulation.15–18 
However, few strategies exist to integrate these complementary therapies with conventional 
approaches to pain management, and little evidence is available to guide collaborative 
management among musculoskeletal specialists, primary care providers, and mental health 
professionals, all of whom are often involved in the management of patients with LBP.19
The Department of Veterans Affairs expanded its delivery of nonpharmacological treatment 
offerings for LBP when, in 2004, it began providing chiropractic services, including spinal 
manipulation, both on site at select VA facilities and through purchased care arrangements

 with private sector providers.20 Previous work indicates that the use of VA chiropractic 
services has grown substantially since its inception, as currently upward of 46,000 veterans 
are being served, and that doctors of chiropractic (DCs) working in VA manage LBP through 
the delivery of evidence-based, nonpharmacological services.21–24 Although the use of 
chiropractic care in VA has expanded,23 few data exist to inform optimal models of access to 
and delivery of chiropractic care, in VA or elsewhere.
The implementation of chiropractic services in VA presents a novel opportunity to explore 
strategies to improve collaborative case management for patients with LBP, including those 
with mental health comorbidity.24,25 One aim of our research project, Collaborative Care for 
Veterans with Spine Pain and Mental Health Conditions, was to develop a consensus-based, 
chiropractic integrated care pathway to guide clinical decision making and improve 
communication and referral processes between DCs, primary care providers, and mental 
health professionals who manage veterans with LBP in VA healthcare facilities. Care 
pathways are health care tools designed to support evidence-based practices, clinical 
decision making, and the organization of care processes for providers treating patients with 
well-defined health conditions, such as those with LBP.26
The purpose of this study was to develop a consensus-based, integrated care pathway for 
DCs, primary care providers, and mental health professionals who manage veterans with 
LBP, with or without mental health comorbidity, within VA health care facilities.
Methods
Project Overview
This study was part of a funded research project (R34 AT008427) designed to integrate 
nonpharmacological approaches into the management of pain and comorbid conditions in 
US military veterans seeking care in VA health care facilities.
Human Participant Considerations
This modified Delphi study was exempted by the Palmer College of Chiropractic 
Institutional Review Board (Approval No X2016-4-11-G, April 13, 2016) and was 
determined to not constitute human participant research by the University of Iowa Human 
Subjects Research Office (notification May 19, 2016). We received written consent and 
permission to publish names from all participants.
Research Participants
Three groups were integral to the development of the integrative care pathway: the 
investigative team, external advisors, and consensus panel. The investigative team included 
10 experts in the fields of chiropractic, primary care, psychiatry, veterans’ health, clinical 
and health services research, and modified Delphi process methodology. This team reviewed 
documents, developed seed statements and algorithms, and identified external advisors and 
consensus panel participants. Five leaders in evidence-based chiropractic practice served as 
advisors who provided feedback on the initial and finals draft of the pathway. A 
multidisciplinary panel of VA clinicians (n = 184) were invited to serve as clinical experts

 for the modified Delphi process. Initial interest was received from 49 DCs employed in VA 
facilities throughout the United States and 21 non-DC clinicians who worked in VA health 
care systems located in Iowa City, Iowa, West Haven, Connecticut, and Minneapolis, 
Minnesota. Sixty-one potential panelists completed consent forms and submitted 
demographic forms.
Fifty-eight VA employees served as consensus panelists. Their mean age was 44 years 
(range: 28–64), the majority being male (n = 41), with a mean of 4.4 years working in VA. 
Eight panelists were themselves military veterans. Professions represented included 
chiropractic (n = 41), medicine (n = 9), physical therapy (n = 3), psychology (n = 2), and an 
advance practice nurse, an occupational therapist, and a dual-trained DC/physical therapist. 
Seven panelists also were trained in acupuncture. Fifty-six identified as clinicians, and of 
those, all managed spine-related pain or disability, 10 provided primary care services, and 15 
managed mental health conditions. Although all panelists had extensive professional 
experience (mean: 15.5 years) and reported a mean number of 57 patient visits per week, 
most had no previous involvement as a Delphi panelist (76%) or in guideline development 
(59%).
Source Documents and Seed Statements
Our selection of source documents from which to develop our seed statements was based on 
identifying clinical guidelines and other practice-based initiatives already recommended for 
use within VA to support pathway integration and uptake by providers. As VA/Department 
of Defense (DoD) has long recommended the use of a widely accepted CPG for LBP 
diagnosis and treatment27 in its health care facilities, that guideline served as the source 
document for this care pathway. This guideline, which recommends spinal manipulative 
therapy for acute, subacute, and chronic LBP, outlines an algorithm for primary care 
providers treating LBP patients, but does not specify processes for referral and 
interdisciplinary communication between primary care and chiropractic clinicians, nor does 
it provide guidance on chiropractic care management of the LBP patient. The vision, 
standards, and approach of the DoD/Veterans Health Administration Pain Management Task 
Force further informed the development of seed statements,28 as did extant chiropractic 
CPG29 and best practice documents.30,31 Guidance on chiropractic treatment frequency and 
duration came from previous work of the VA Chiropractic Field Advisory Committee.32 
Statements on mental health concerns were derived from VA’s Make the Connection 
website, an online resource for veterans, active duty military, friends and family, and 
clinicians on topics such as mental health, daily living, and transition to civilian life (http://
maketheconnection.net/; accessed May 26, 2016). As revisions to the primary source 
document27 were published toward the end of our process,16,17 a review of the updated 
citations by the investigative team ensured that the care pathway adhered to these new 
recommendations.
Four investigators prepared the first round of seed statements in areas of their clinical and 
research expertise based on these source documents. Seed statements were refined through 
an iterative process involving the rest of the investigative team, and then organized into 
thematic headings. Algorithms were prepared based on those published in a recent revision

 of a CPG on chiropractic care for LBP29 and the clinical expertise of the investigators who 
were VA-based DCs. We distributed this initial draft to the external advisors, who reviewed 
each statement and algorithm to refine or clarify recommendations and processes. The 
investigative team finalized these revisions and approved this final draft for distribution to 
the panelists.
Modified Delphi Consensus Process
As the current VA guideline for LBP offered few details on interdisciplinary care processes 
that include chiropractic care for veterans with LBP conditions, we chose to conduct a 
modified Delphi process study to seek consensus among clinicians who work in real-world 
VA settings on best practices for establishing interprofessional collaboration and 
communication for this patient group.33 We used a modification of the RAND Corporation/
University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) consensus methodology to conduct this 
modified Delphi study.34 Data collection was conducted electronically, by email, with the 
external advisors and panelists. The chiropractic profession has used the e-Delphi process 
previously to develop CPGs35 and best practice documents.29–31 Nominees received an 
invitational e-mail that included an overview of the research grant, purpose of the care 
pathway, introduction to the Delphi process, and research responsibilities, including time 
commitment. Interested persons submitted a written consent, background form, and 
curriculum vitae. Investigators reviewed these materials to ensure a diverse, cross-
disciplinary panel. Two mental health professionals were added when original mental health 
panelists withdrew because of time constraints.
During each round, panelists received a rating sheet that included the seed statements and 
clinical algorithms. Panelists rated the appropriateness of the content of each seed statement, 
with “appropriateness” defined as the expected health benefit is greater to the patient than 
any expected negative consequences.34 Ratings used an ordinal scale of 1 to 9 (scores 1–3 
described as “highly inappropriate” and scores 7–9 as “highly appropriate”). Panelists 
provided a reason for any “inappropriate” ratings and supplied citations from refereed 
literature to facilitate revisions. Text fields were available for each seed statement to allow 
written comments.
Numerical responses were entered into a spreadsheet and tabulated. Verbatim comments 
were de-identified and entered into a word processing program. Agreement (consensus) on 
appropriateness was reached if a minimum of 80% of panelists rated a statement as 7, 8, or 9 
and the median response score was at least 7. Investigators revised statements for which 
consensus was not reached and recirculated the results to the panelists until a consensus of 
80% was reached. Panelists received the revised seed statements, the level of consensus 
achieved on the statement during the previous round, and submitted comments with rating 
score in a de-identified document.
The consensus process occurred between July and December 2016. Round 1 ran for 10 
weeks from August to October 2016 and consisted of 43 seed statements and 3 algorithms. 
Round 2 was completed over 3 weeks in October 2016 and included 2 revised statements, 
suggestions for the deletion of 1 algorithm and revisions to a second, and a new seed 
statement to replace the deleted algorithm. Investigators distributed the final draft of the care

 pathway in December 2016, with no substantive feedback received from the panelists or 
external advisors. Fifty-eight panelists reviewed the pathway during round 1, and 56 
panelists completed round 2.
Results
Consensus Statements: Chiropractic Integrative Care Pathway for Veterans
For patients with LBP, primary care providers may consider the use of nonpharmacological 
therapies with proven benefits along with other treatment options.16 Clinical practice 
guidelines recommend the use of spinal manipulation for adults with LBP.16 In VA, 
chiropractic care, including spinal manipulation, is a tier 1 integrative pain treatment 
modality that may be incorporated into a veteran’s patient-centered plan of care.28
The purpose of this chiropractic integrated care pathway is to define the parameters of an 
appropriate approach incorporating mental health and chiropractic considerations in the 
primary management of patients with LBP presenting for care at VA health care facilities. 
Mental health conditions are common among VA patients. During the course of care, DCs 
may identify changes in a patient’s mental health status that may require additional follow-
up. Although this care pathway focuses on LBP management, it also includes an overview of 
common mental health comorbidities, and referral algorithms for primary care providers, 
mental health specialists, and chiropractors in VA settings.
Informed Consent for Clinical Care
•
Informed consent is the process of proactive communication between a patient 
and provider resulting in the patient's authorization or agreement to undergo a 
specific health care intervention.
•
Informed consent includes information about the suggested treatment approach, 
its potential benefits, possible risks, and availability of other treatment options.
•
Obtain informed consent from the patient, either verbally or in writing, within 
local and/or regional standards of practice.
History and Examination
•
Before using any intervention such as exercise, joint manipulation, or other 
manual therapy, obtain, at a minimum, an appropriate history and perform a 
regional examination of the area to be treated. These efforts must be sufficient to 
reach a working diagnosis, rule out probable or suspected underlying conditions 
that may contraindicate any intended treatment, and provide the clinical rationale 
for reasonable and appropriate evaluation and treatment.
•
Obtain a problem-focused health history of the musculoskeletal chief complaint 
and any associated conditions and confirm documentation of such pertinent 
health information in the clinical record, including but not limited to:
○
Symptom history
○
Injury history, as applicable

 ○
Past medical and surgical history, including response to treatment
○
Past manual therapy history (chiropractic, osteopathic or other spinal 
manipulation, physical therapy, acupuncture, etc), including response 
to treatment
○
Use of active care and other self-management strategies
○
Medication review (over-the-counter and prescription medication, 
including opioids/narcotics)
○
Substance use history (alcohol, tobacco, recreational drugs, 
prescription drug misuse)
○
Family health and social history
○
Review of systems
•
Review clinical record for information on VA disability status, service 
connection, non-VA disability-related claims, and designated disability rating for 
spine disorders and related health conditions.
•
Conduct initial examination to provide diagnostic information for preliminary or 
differential diagnoses. Problem-focused examination may include, but is not 
limited to:
○
Regional musculoskeletal and neurological exam, including symptom 
severity and functional deficits
○
Cognitive status examination, including level of alertness, ability to 
understand and follow instructions
○
Review of existing laboratory or other diagnostic testing
○
Order or request the appropriate clinician order, any pertinent 
laboratory, or other diagnostic testing, when indicated
•
The initial history and examination for patients presenting for chiropractic 
evaluation screens for serious pathology, or red flags, related to spine pain. Signs 
or symptoms leading to a clinical suspicion of serious pathology are evaluated 
through additional office procedures or advanced diagnostic testing (see 
statements on diagnostic imaging) or referred to their primary care provider for 
evaluation or treatment. Examples of serious pathology include, but are not 
limited to acute or progressing conditions such as:
○
Progressive neurological disorders
○
Cauda equina syndrome
○
Malignancy
○
Spinal infection
○
Abdominal aortic aneurysm
○
Fracture

 ○
Articular derangements/instability
○
Cerebral ischemic symptoms
○
Inflammatory arthropathy (rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, 
psoriatic arthritis, etc)
•
Review clinical records for past or current treatment of mental health disorders; 
trauma-related conditions, including traumatic brain injury, PTSD, and military 
sexual trauma (MST); neurological conditions with behavioral components; and 
risk of suicide including previous suicidal attempts.
•
Confirm presence of psychosocial risk factors for chronic disabling LBP, such as 
depression, anxiety, fear-avoidance behaviors, catastrophization, somatization, 
pain expectations, work-related stressors, and passive coping.
Patient-Reported Outcomes
•
Assess patient-reported outcomes with appropriate, standardized, condition-
specific, VA-approved instruments at the initial evaluation, at other treatment 
visits as indicated, and during formal evaluations to determine the need for 
continued chiropractic management.
•
Patient-reported outcomes for LBP may include measures of pain, condition-
related disability, activities of daily living, physical and mental health function, 
quality of life, work capacity, and other key domains, as indicated.
Diagnostic Imaging
•
Routine imaging or other advanced diagnostic tests are not recommended for 
initial evaluation of patients with uncomplicated LBP of musculoskeletal origin. 
Imaging and other diagnostic tests may be indicated when patients with LBP 
experience severe and/or progressive neurologic deficits or if the history and/or 
examination cause suspicion of serious underlying pathology.
•
Consider imaging or other diagnostic testing when patients with LBP fail to 
improve following a reasonable course of care.
•
Coordinate ordering of diagnostic tests with the patient’s primary care provider 
or other referral mechanism.
•
Patients with persistent LBP and/or lumbar radiculopathy who may be candidates 
for interventional pain medicine procedures or surgery should be evaluated with 
magnetic resonance imaging (preferred) or computed tomography.
Case Management
•
Document an individualized plan of care reflective of an evidence-based 
treatment approach consistent with the patient’s clinical presentation, diagnosis, 
and any concurrent or collaborative care, which should be supported by health 
history and examination findings.

 •
The management plan should include outcome assessments, case management 
decisions, and documentation of therapeutic interventions.
•
Appropriate documentation includes notation of the anatomical region(s) treated 
in sufficient detail to ensure that another provider with similar training would 
understand how to replicate the procedure(s). Detailed documentation includes, 
but is not limited to type of exercise, rehabilitation procedure, and manipulative 
or other manual therapy intervention delivered.
•
Provide patients with evidence-based information on their musculoskeletal 
complaint, such as LBP, with regard to the expected course for their specific 
condition, advice to remain active as appropriate, condition-specific exercises, 
and effective self-management options.
•
Encourage self-care activities that promote optimal pain management and mental 
health such as physical activity, regular healthy meals, good sleep quality, 
relaxation techniques, deep breathing, and involvement in social activities and 
hobbies.
Adverse Events and Side Effects
•
Initiate timely and appropriate follow-up, referral, or transfer to a suitable health 
care setting for a patient in the event of a serious adverse event following 
treatment or in another medical emergency.
•
A serious adverse event is defined as one resulting in death, life-threatening 
symptoms, hospitalization, or disability or requiring intervention to prevent 
permanent impairment or damage.
•
Evaluate and document side effects (such as increased pain, muscle stiffness or 
soreness, headache, dizziness, radiating symptoms, paresthesia, and fatigue) or 
adverse events from any intervention delivered including manipulation, manual 
therapies, and exercise at each treatment visit.
Interprofessional Communication
•
Frequent, ongoing communication between health care providers is a necessary 
feature of interprofessional collaboration for VA patients. Such interprofessional 
communication may occur through electronic health records, other VA-approved 
electronic communication systems, telephone calls, or face-to-face meetings.
•
If the patient’s condition is not appropriate for chiropractic management, notify 
primary care provider, suggest referral to other services, and provide the patient 
with appropriate self-management instructions, as indicated.
•
If significant pain or functional deficits remain after the maximum therapeutic 
benefit is reached with chiropractic care, consult with and/or refer patient to an 
appropriate provider.

 •
Consult with or refer the patient to an appropriate provider if co-management is 
indicated, such as a patient who has comorbidities requiring evaluation or 
treatment outside the chiropractic scope of practice.
Mental Health Concerns
•
At any point during a course of care, patients presenting with a new, suspected, 
or change in a mental health condition should be assessed for the need for 
immediate referral to the psychiatric emergency department (concern that he or 
she may harm self or others, or other emergent circumstances).
•
Communicate with a patient’s mental health professional and/or primary care 
provider whenever a patient has a change in a previously diagnosed mental 
health problem or other comorbid condition, which may require a modification 
of his or her current treatment plan.
•
Signs and symptoms of depression: feeling sad or hopeless; loss of interest in 
daily activities; weight changes; sleep changes; feelings of restlessness or 
tiredness; feelings of unworthiness or guilt; difficulty with focus or decision 
making; feeling nervous or worried; drinking more alcohol or caffeine; taking 
more prescription or over-the-counter medications; smoking or using tobacco 
more. Depression may be present if a patient experiences these symptoms nearly 
every day for at least 2 weeks. Refer to mental health or primary care provider, as 
indicated.
•
Signs and symptoms of anxiety disorders: pounding or racing heart; feeling 
restless, on edge, or jumpy; trembling or shaking; difficulty breathing; feeling of 
fullness in throat or chest; dizziness or lightheadedness; stomachaches or nausea; 
trouble sleeping; feeling angry or irritable; difficulty concentrating; distraction; 
drinking or using drugs to numb feelings. Refer to mental health or primary care 
provider if patient reports a new onset or worsening of symptoms.
•
Signs and symptoms of PTSD: feeling upset by things that remind the patient of 
the trauma; nightmares; flashbacks; feeling numb or emotionally cut off from 
persons or things that interested them; feeling on guard, being jumpy or easily 
startled; feeling irritated or angry; difficulty sleeping; difficulty concentrating; 
drinking or using drugs to numb feelings. Refer patients with PTSD symptoms to 
their primary care or mental health provider.
•
Some signs and symptoms of bipolar disorder may overlap with and be 
distinguished from those of clinical depression: manic episode symptoms such as 
doing things one might later regret (spending lots of money, gambling, 
arguments, reckless sexual activity), problems with focus, racing thoughts, 
talking faster than usual, appearing high even if no drugs were taken, taking risks 
or getting into unsafe situations; and depressed episode symptoms such as 
feeling hopeless or sad, low energy, difficulty remembering things or making 
decisions, changes in eating or sleeping (more or less than usual), not enjoying 
life or usual activities. If symptoms are present, refer to the appropriate provider.

 •
Survivors of MST may be female, male, or transgender persons. Be aware of the 
mental health difficulties survivors of MST may experience: strong emotions 
(depression, anger, irritability), sudden emotional responses, feeling emotionally 
flat or numb, trouble feeling love or happiness, trouble sleeping including 
nightmares, trouble with attention and concentration, problems with alcohol or 
drugs, troubles with reminders of sexual trauma, problems trusting others or in 
relationships, sexual issues, chronic pain, weight or eating problems, stomach or 
bowel problems. Modify treatment visits as outlined above. Refer patients with a 
new onset or worsening of these concerns to an appropriate provider, as 
indicated.
•
Ask patient about the use of alcohol, tobacco, marijuana, prescription pain 
medications including opioids, and illicit/street drugs as strategies to manage 
pain or cope with mental health problems, and determine if the patient is willing 
to accept a referral for substance abuse or tobacco cessation treatment. Refer 
patients who are receptive to the appropriate provider or clinic, as indicated.
•
Patients with acute or chronic pain may experience insomnia or difficulty 
sleeping. If patient reports problem with sleep that is not improved following 
chiropractic treatments for their pain, consider referral to primary care or mental 
health provider, as indicated.
•
Offer patients VA-sponsored online resources for additional information about 
managing their pain and mental health, at the initial visit or as indicated.
•
Document mental health history findings if indicated. Communicate with and/or 
refer to primary care or mental health provider, if indicated.
Chiropractic Treatment Frequency and Duration
•
Recommended chiropractic treatment frequency and duration for VA patients 
with spine-related symptoms as outlined in Table 1.
Modifying Manual Therapy Procedures
•
Patients with musculoskeletal pain, including those with or without a history of 
PTSD, MST, or other exposure to interpersonal violence, may have varying 
reactions to unexpected touch, have difficulty relaxing, and/or exhibit guarding 
behaviors.
•
Patients also may be startled easily or feel unsafe in situations that remind them 
of past trauma. Chiropractic treatments and other manual therapy procedures 
may require modification to address these concerns.
•
Describe any touch-based interactions before initiating, especially those that 
occur outside the patient’s visual field, and ask for permission to enter a patient’s 
personal space.
•
Inform patients of any sounds or activities (eg, table drops or instrument sounds) 
that might be startling during the office visit.

 •
Carefully consider person positioning within the examination or treatment room, 
as well as the patient’s positioning during both examination and treatment to 
afford the patient the ability to maintain a sense of control and safety at all times 
during a visit.
•
Consider the possibility of including or allowing a chaperone/support person to 
accompany the patient during the visit.
Algorithms for Chiropractic Care in Veterans Affairs Healthcare Facilities
An algorithm for primary care referrals to chiropractic care for veterans with LBP is outlined 
in Figure 1. The algorithm for the initiation of chiropractic care is outlined in Figure 2. The 
algorithm for chiropractic case management, applicable to both acute and chronic LBP, is 
outlined in Figure 3. Initial dosing should be guided by the information provided in Table 1.
Discussion
To our knowledge, this is the first chiropractic integrated care pathway for veterans with 
LBP, with or without comorbid mental illness, that proposes a standardized approach to 
interdisciplinary referral to chiropractic services and for chiropractic case management in 
VA health care settings. This care pathway is based on available LBP clinical practice 
guidelines,16,27 existing VA care processes and pain management initiatives,28 expert 
opinion, and achieved consensus among our consensus panelists. This pathway includes 
spinal manipulation, a central component of chiropractic care, which is congruent with the 
findings of a widely cited systematic review.36 Clinicians may use the pathway to guide 
clinical decision making and improve communication and referral processes, particularly 
between primary care providers, mental health professionals, and DCs who are involved in 
treating veterans with LBP. Because interprofessional collaboration among all health care 
providers is challenging37 and the degree of chiropractic integration varies by facility,20 this 
pathway also may be useful to health care administrators in VA or other multidisciplinary 
clinical settings seeking to integrate chiropractic care into their offered services.
This care pathway presents chiropractic treatment schedules for uncomplicated acute LBP 
(≤6–10 visits over 6 weeks), complicated acute LBP (≤6–12 visits over 6 weeks), and 
chronic LBP (≤12 visits over 10 weeks) based on expert clinical opinion and achieved 
consensus among our consensus panelists.32 These treatment recommendations are of 
different frequency dosages than those producing clinically important outcomes for chronic 
LBP (12–18 weekly visits) in randomized controlled trials conducted outside VA settings.
38,39 The typical chiropractic visit in VA is 30 minutes in duration, compared with 15 
minutes in the large published trial.39 Thus, further research is needed to determine the 
optimal dose of chiropractic care to manage LBP and other MSK complaints in veteran 
populations, whose physical health and mental well-being may differ from those of 
community-based chiropractic patients.
This pathway addressed multimodal chiropractic care, rather than focusing on spinal 
manipulation as an isolated treatment modality. However, recommendations for specific

 elements of multimodal chiropractic care (eg, patient education, manual techniques, 
exercise) were beyond the scope of this project.
We did not address the use of specific clinical assessment tools, including instruments 
designed to determine the risk of delayed recovery or persistent disability from LBP, as 
many such tools have not yet been validated in veteran populations. We also did not address 
the use of patient-reported experience measures, such as patient expectations and satisfaction 
with care, again because of the lack of standardized, validated instruments for use in VA 
patients seeking chiropractic care. The DoD/Veterans Health Administration Pain 
Management Task Force guidance28 does recommend some specific instrumentation for pain 
assessment as outlined in this clinical pathway; however, many measures currently in use in 
VA settings are those preferred by individual providers or instituted by clinical departments.
Strengths and Limitations
One strength of this study was our interdisciplinary research team, which included several 
members who are practicing VA chiropractors or who, along with our advisory committee 
members, have developed clinical practice guidelines in the past. In addition, we convened a 
large, interdisciplinary panel of VA clinicians, including more than 40 DCs, who have varied 
and diverse expertise in the care of veterans with musculoskeletal conditions and mental 
health concerns to serve as consensus panelists. This panel came to consensus on seed 
statements and algorithms that we based on established clinical guidelines and educational 
modules approved for use in VA settings.
Although we used these multidisciplinary CPGs as source documents, some seed statements 
and aspects of the clinical algorithms developed during this study were based on our 
knowledge of existing VA care processes and expert opinion on the appropriateness of these 
processes, neither of which has been evaluated in experimental studies. As our process was 
to base seed statements on CPGs currently in use in VA settings, we used a nonstructured 
search strategy to locate such documents on VA/DoD clinical practice guideline and 
educational sites and did not assess the quality of these sources with independent assessors 
using validated tools. Other potentially informative documents might have been uncovered 
with the use of different search strategies.
There also may be important limitations when implementing the pathway in different VA 
contexts. This pathway is limited to care provided on station at VA facilities where DCs are 
integrated into team-based management. Generalizability beyond these settings is unknown. 
Doctor of chiropractic representation on the panel was geographically diverse, although 
input from other health professionals was reserved to staff members of 3 VA facilities. 
Research on the process of implementing chiropractic,20 evidence-based guidelines,40 
patient-centered medical homes,41 and other care processes42 within VA has been observed 
to vary at the institutional level. Therefore, VA providers may find they need to tailor this 
care pathway for their facility. Our team planned to solicit feedback from VA patients on the 
pathway during its development, but patient recruitment was not possible in the study time 
frame. We will seek input from veterans during a pilot trial that will investigate the 
feasibility and acceptability of this pathway for guiding chiropractic treatments for VA 
patients.

 Conclusions
This article offers an integrated care pathway for chiropractic management of veterans with 
LBP, with or without mental health comorbidity. The pathway was developed by VA-based 
DCs, primary care providers, mental health professionals, and clinical experts in the field of 
veterans’ health. The pathway provides a reasonable approach to multidisciplinary care for 
veterans with acute and chronic LBP.

Further improvement in symptoms or condition cannot be reasonably expected and treatment 
is not considered necessary to prevent an immediate decline in status. 2Trial withdrawal may 
be necessary when a patient reaches maximum therapeutic benefit to determine if condition 
recovery is stable. If condition deteriorates after the trial, then ongoing care may be 
necessary to maintain function and minimize symptoms. The therapeutic withdrawal can be 
gradual, where the patient’s care is reduced through tapered visits. It can also be rapid, with 
the patient instructed to return for care or evaluation only if symptoms recur or worsen. The 
patient can be scheduled for an evaluation at a later date to evaluate for signs of regression.

Minimum clinically important improvement: The threshold of a beneficial patient-oriented change that can be ascribed to treatment effects. 
Objective measures of such are a decrease of ≥2 points on the NPRS, and/or a decrease in ≥10 points on the Oswestry Disability Questionnaire, 
and/or similar improvement on other comparable outcome measures.
Complicated case: Presence of one or more of the following: severe pain (8, 9, or 10 on NPRS); history of ≥4 prior episodes; pain duration N8 
days; structural pathology/anomaly; relevant comorbid conditions.
Chronic condition: Condition that has been present for >3 mo and typically has failed other treatment approaches.

aAdditional chiropractic manipulative therapy or other palliative/supportive care for pain management may be indicated for patients with chronic 
conditions whose function decreases and/or pain increases after a withdrawal of chiropractic care. This added course of chiropractic management 
may be appropriate for patients engaged in active care strategies, if other indicated medical and psychosocial treatment options have been 
considered and/or included in the overall VA pain management plan.
