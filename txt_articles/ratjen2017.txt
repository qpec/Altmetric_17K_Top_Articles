Summary
Background Lumacaftor and ivacaftor combination treatment showed efficacy in patients aged 12 years or older with cystic 
fibrosis homozygous for F508del-cystic fibrosis trans 
membrane conductance regulator (CFTR) in placebo-controlled studies 
and patients aged 6–11 years with cystic fibrosis homozygous for F508del-CFTR in an open-label study. We report efficacy 
and safety of lumacaftor and ivacaftor in patients with cystic fibrosis aged 6–11 years homozygous for F508del-CFTR.
Methods In this phase 3, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre study, patients were enrolled at 
54 hospitals and medical centres in nine countries (the USA, Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, 
Sweden, and the UK). Eligible patients weighed at least 15 kg, with a confirmed diagnosis of cystic fibrosis, percent 
predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) of 70 or more, and lung clearance index2∙5 (LCI2∙5) of 7∙5 or more at 
screening (values less than these thresholds were permitted at day 1). All patients were tested for CFTR genotype at 
screening; eligible patients had to have the F508del-CFTR mutation on both alleles. Exclusion criteria included any 
comorbidity or laboratory abnormality that might confound the study results or pose additional risk to the patient. Patients 
were stratified by weight (<25 kg vs ≥25 kg) and ppFEV1 severity (<90 vs ≥90) determined at the screening visit, and 
randomly assigned 1:1 to treatment using an interactive web response system to receive 200 mg lumacaftor and 250 mg 
ivacaftor every 12 hours or placebo for 24 weeks. Patients, all site personnel including the investigator and the site monitor, 
and the study team were blinded, with the exception of site personnel needing this information in the event of medical 
emergency or pregnancy and patient safety and regulatory affairs personnel to meet serious adverse event reporting 
requirements. The primary endpoint was the mean absolute change in LCI2∙5 from all on-treatment study visits up to and 
including week 24. All randomly assigned patients who were exposed to any amount of study drug, with treatment 
assignment as assigned were included in primary and other efficacy analyses. All patients who were exposed to any 
amount of study drug, with treatment assignment as treated, were included in the safety analysis. This study was registered 
with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02514473.
Findings Between July 23, 2015, and Sept 20, 2016, a total of 206 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive 
lumacaftor and ivacaftor (n=104) or placebo (n=102). Two randomly assigned patients were never dosed with study drug 
(one in the placebo arm due to ineligibility arising from a streptococcal throat infection and one in the lumacaftor and 
ivacaftor arm due to withdrawal based on refusal to provide blood tests) and were not included in the analyses. 103 patients 
received at least one dose of lumacaftor and ivacaftor and 101 patients received at least one dose of placebo. For the primary 
endpoint, the average absolute change in LCI2∙5 from baseline over all study visits up to and including the week 24 visit, 
least squares mean difference was −1∙09 units (95% CI −1∙43 to −0∙75, p<0∙0001) for lumacaftor and ivacaftor versus 
placebo. For the key secondary endpoint of sweat chloride concentration, the least squares mean difference versus placebo 
was −20∙8 mmol/L (95% CI −23∙4 to −18∙2, average absolute change at day 15/week 4; p<0∙0001). The least squares mean 
difference compared with placebo in absolute change in ppFEV1 from all on-treatment study visits until week 24 was 2∙4 
(95% CI 0∙4–4∙4, p=0∙0182). 196 (96%) of 204 patients reported adverse events, most of which were mild (87 [43%]) or 
moderate (98 [48%]). Treatment was discontinued due to adverse events in three (3%) of 103 patients in the lumacaftor and 
ivacaftor group and two (2%) of 101 patients in the placebo group. Serious adverse events were reported in 13 (13%) of 
103 patients in the lumacaftor and ivacaftor group and 11 (11%) of 101 patients in the placebo group.
Interpretation Treatment with lumacaftor and ivacaftor was associated with statistically significant improvements in lung 
function, as measured by LCI2∙5 and ppFEV1, versus placebo in patients aged 6–11 years with cystic fibrosis homozygous 
for F508del-CFTR. The overall safety profile was consistent with previous phase 3 studies of lumacaftor and ivacaftor.

Introduction
Cystic fibrosis is a chronic, genetic disease characterised 
by loss of lung function, poor nutritional status, 
pulmonary exacerbations, and respiratory failure.1 The 
disease is caused by defects in the cystic fibrosis trans­

channel in the apical membrane of epithelial cells that 
conducts chloride ions and helps modulate bicarbonate 
ion transport.2,3 Defective CFTR protein arises from 
mutations in the CFTR gene,4 the most common being 
the F508del mutation, for which approximately 38% of 
the global cystic fibrosis population is homozygous.5 The 
F508del-CFTR mutation affects processing and trafficking 
of the CFTR protein such that most is targeted for 
degradation before reaching the cell surface.6 F508del­
CFTR protein expressed at the apical membrane is 
usually unstable and functionally defective.7,8
Therapies directly targeting CFTR function have been 
developed, including ivacaftor, a CFTR potentiator that 
has been shown to increase channel open probability of 
mutant CFTR in vitro.9 Delivery of CFTR protein to the 
cell surface can be increased by lumacaftor, a CFTR 
corrector that improves the processing and trafficking 
of F508del­CFTR protein.10 Lumacaftor in combination 
with ivacaftor has greater effects than either agent 
alone, both in vitro and clinically in specific cystic 
fibrosis genotypes.9–12 Combination treatment for 
24 weeks improved lung function, reduced frequency of 
cystic fibrosis­related pulmonary exacerbations, and 
improved body­mass index (BMI) in two large phase 3 
studies (TRAFFIC and TRANSPORT) in patients aged 
12 years or older with cystic fibrosis and homozygous 
for F508del-CFTR.12 In an open­label phase 3 study,13 
treatment with lumacaftor and ivacaftor was well 
tolerated over 24 weeks in patients aged 6–11 years 
homozygous for F508del-CFTR, with a safety profile 
similar to that seen in older patients. After treatment 
initiation, 
sweat 
chloride 
concentration 
rapidly 
decreased in the trial population of this study,13 
returning to baseline after discontinuation of therapy. 
Although statistically significant improvements in 
percent predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 s 
(ppFEV1) were not observed in this population with 
generally preserved spirometric measures of lung 
function, ventilation inhomogeneity measured by the 
lung clearance index (LCI2∙5; number of lung volume 
turnovers required to reach 2∙5% of starting tracer gas 
concentration), BMI Z score, and quality of life 
measures improved significantly. It is not uncommon 
for patients in this age group to have normal 
spirometry,14 even when structural abnormalities can be 
observed with high­resolution computed tomography15 
and hyperpolarised gas MRI16,17 and LCI, which 
measures small airway disease, shows impaired 
ventilation.18,19
We designed this phase 3 study to further investigate 
the efficacy and safety of lumacaftor in combination 
with ivacaftor in patients aged 6–11 years with cystic 
fibrosis homozygous for the F508del-CFTR mutation. 
LCI2∙5 was chosen as the primary endpoint based on 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
We searched PubMed on Feb 6, 2017, with the terms “ivacaftor” 
or “VX-770” and “lumacaftor” or “VX-809”, with no restrictions 
on publication date or language. We identified four relevant 
clinical studies: one combined report of two phase 3 trials in 
patients aged 12 years or older with cystic fibrosis and 
homozygous for F508del-CFTR (TRAFFIC and TRANSPORT); 
a phase 3 extension study of TRAFFIC and TRANSPORT 
(PROGRESS); and an open-label, phase 3 study in patients aged 
6–11 years with cystic fibrosis and homozygous for 
F508del-CFTR. Lumacaftor and ivacaftor are modulators of the 
cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) 
ion channel. Combination therapy with lumacaftor and 
ivacaftor for 24 weeks in patients aged 12 years and older 
improved lung function and nutritional status, and decreased 
rates of pulmonary exacerbation, with an acceptable safety 
profile in the TRAFFIC and TRANSPORT trials. In the 96-week 
extension study (PROGRESS), the safety profile remained 
consistent, with benefits of lumacaftor and ivacaftor therapy 
being observed up to 120 weeks of treatment. Lumacaftor and 
ivacaftor treatment was also well tolerated over 24 weeks in 
younger patients with cystic fibrosis (aged 6–11 years) and 
homozygous for F508del-CFTR in an open-label, phase 3 study.
Added value of this study
In this phase 3, randomised, placebo-controlled trial 
(VX14-809-109), the efficacy of lumacaftor and ivacaftor 
combination therapy in patients aged 6–11 years with cystic 
fibrosis homozygous for the F508del-CFTR mutation was 
further assessed. Lung function in this paediatric population 
was measured by lung clearance index (LCI2∙5), a sensitive 
measure of ventilation inhomogeneity, and spirometry 
(percent predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 s [ppFEV1]). 
Pharmacodynamic effect on CFTR function was established by 
assessment of sweat chloride concentration. LCI2∙5 and sweat 
chloride concentration improved significantly (ie, decreased) in 
the lumacaftor and ivacaftor group versus the placebo group. 
A significant treatment difference favouring lumacaftor and 
ivacaftor over placebo was also observed for ppFEV1. The safety 
findings were consistent with those reported previously in 
young patients with cystic fibrosis homozygous for the 
F508del-CFTR mutation.
Implications of all the available evidence
Significant improvements in lung function with lumacaftor 
and ivacaftor treatment were seen when measured by 
absolute change from baseline in LCI2∙5 relative to placebo 
treatment. Sweat chloride concentration also improved 
significantly (ie, decreased), thus providing a mechanistic 
CFTR biomarker of modulator efficacy. This phase 3 trial 
provides rigorous evidence for efficacy with lumacaftor and 
ivacaftor in the paediatric population at the early stages of 
disease and is among the first to use LCI2∙5 as a primary 
endpoint.

Methods
Study design and participants
This phase 3, randomised, double­blind, placebo­
controlled, parallel­group, multicentre study was done in 
patients aged 6–11 years with cystic fibrosis who were 
homozygous for the F508del-CFTR mutation (appendix). 
The study protocol, informed consent, and other 
necessary documents were approved by an independent 
ethics committee or institutional review board for each 
study site before initiation. This study was done in 
accordance with good clinical practice as described in the 
International Conference on Harmonisation Guideline 
E6, Good Clinical Practice, Consolidated Guidance 
(April, 1996). A total of 54 study sites (hospitals and 
medical centres) from the USA, Australia, Belgium, 
Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Sweden, and 
the UK participated in the trial. 
Eligible patients were aged 6–11 years and weighed at 
least 15 kg, with a confirmed diagnosis of cystic fibrosis, 
ppFEV1 of 70 or more, and LCI2∙5 of 7∙5 or more (the 
upper limit of normal in this age group21) at screening 
(values less than these thresholds were permitted at 
day 1). Treatment was initiated within 28 days of 
screening. All patients were tested for CFTR genotype at 
screening; eligible patients had to have the F508del-CFTR 
mutation on both alleles. All enrolled patients and their 
parent or legal guardian provided written informed 
consent. 
Patients were excluded if they had a comorbidity that 
might pose additional risk or confound study results (eg, 
history of cirrhosis with portal hypertension, history of 
risk factors for torsades de pointes), clinically significant 
abnormalities (haemoglobin <10 g/dL, abnormal liver or 
renal function), acute upper or lower respiratory 
infection, pulmonary exacerbation or changes in therapy 
for pulmonary disease within 28 days before day 1 of the 
study, or a history of solid organ or haematological 
transplantation.
Randomisation and masking
Patients were stratified by weight (<25 kg vs 
≥25 kg) and ppFEV1 severity (<90 vs ≥90), both determined 
at the screening visit, and then randomly assigned (1:1) 
to lumacaftor 200 mg every 12 hours in combination 
with ivacaftor 250 mg every 12 hours or matched 
placebo (appendix). Random assignment was deter­
mined using an interactive web response system 
(IWRS), and stratification influenced assignment such 
that groups were to be balanced for each stratification 
criterion: within each stratum, the IWRS randomly 
assigned patients to one of the two treatment groups. 
Randomisation blocks were assigned within stratum. 
Randomisation code for the IRWS was prepared by an 
external qualified randomisation vendor, who reviewed 
the final randomisation list and transferred it directly to 
the IWRS vendor. The randomisation vendor had no 
other involvement in the trial. The sponsor study team, 
including study biostatistician, had no access to the 
final live unblinded randomisation list during the study 
conduct. Blinding was achieved by using placebo tablets 
visually identical to the test product. 
Procedures
Film­coated, fixed­dose combination tablets containing 
100 mg lumacaftor and 125 mg ivacaftor or matching 
placebo were administered orally (2 tablets every 12 hours) 
under parental supervision for 24 weeks of treatment. All 
study visits were scheduled relative to the day 1 visit, eg, 
the week 8 (+/–5 days) visit would occur after 8 weeks of 
study drug administration was completed (day 57, the 
start of week 9). At study visits at day 1 and 15, and 
weeks 4, 16, and 24 (appendix), LCI2∙5 was measured by 
multiple breath N2 washout22,23 (Exhalyzer® D, EcoMedics 
AG, Duernen, Switzerland). During this test, a tracer 
gas (N2) undergoes washout from the lungs while the 
patient breathes 100% O2. LCI2∙5 represents the number of 
lung volume turnovers required to reduce the tracer gas 
concentration to 2∙5% of its initial concentration. 
A reduction in LCI2∙5 indicates improve 
ment in ventilation 
inhomogeneity. LCI2∙5 values from visits with at least 
two acceptable trials were reported. Details on multiple­
breath washout training, certification, and quality control 
are included in the appendix. Spirometry (all study visits) 
and sweat chloride concentration (day 1 and 15, and 
weeks 4, 16, and 24) were also measured, and the Cystic 
Fibrosis Questionnaire­Revised (CFQ­R)24 was completed 
before the morning dose of study drug at all clinical visits. 
The version and format of the CFQ­R was based on age 
at day 1. Fecal elastase­1 (FE­1) measurements were 
recorded at baseline and week 24. Safety assessments 
included adverse events (as determined by the 
investigator), clinical laboratory assessments, vital 
signs, pulse oximetry, electrocardiograms, physical 
examinations, ophthalmologic examinations, and spiro­
metry (including serial post­dose measurements). At the 
week 24 visit, patients who completed study drug 
treatment and visits in the treatment period were offered 
the option of enrolment in an open­label 96­week rollover 
study (VX15­809­110, NCT02544451; appendix). A safety 
follow­up visit occurred 4 weeks (+/–7 days) after the last 
dose; this visit was not required for patients who enrolled 
in the rollover study within 28 days after last dose of study 
drug.
Outcomes
Efficacy and safety were assessed for all patients who were 
randomly assigned and received at least one dose of study 
drug. The primary endpoint was mean absolute change in 
LCI2∙5 from baseline at all study visits up to and including 
week 24. Key secondary endpoints included the average 
absolute change in sweat chloride concentration from

baseline at day 15 and week 4, absolute change in BMI 
from baseline at week 24, and average absolute change in 
CFQ­R respiratory domain score from baseline study visit 
up to and including week 24, for this and all subsequent 
instances. Other secondary endpoints included absolute 
change in LCI5·0 (average of all visits up to and including 
week 24), absolute and relative change in ppFEV1 (average 
of all visits up to and including week 24), nutritional 
parameters (weight, height, and corresponding Z scores), 
absolute change in Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire 
for Medication domains (average of all visits up to and 
including week 24), time­to­first pulmonary exacerbation 
(average of all visits up to week 24), event of having at least 
one pulmonary exacerbation (average of all visits up to 
week 24), number of pulmonary exacerbations (average of 
all visits up to week 24), safety, and pharmacokinetics of 
lumacaftor (and its metabolite M28­LUM) and ivacaftor 
(and metabolites M1­IVA and M6­IVA). An independent 
data monitoring committee safety review was done after 
100 patients completed week 4 of treatment.
Statistical analyses
The primary analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint—
absolute change from baseline in LCI2∙5 (including all 
measurements up to and including week 24, both 
on­treatment measurements and measurements after 
treatment discontinuation)—was based on a mixed­effects 
model for repeated measurements (MMRM; SAS 
statistical software package, SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA). 
The model included absolute change from baseline 
in LCI2∙5 as the dependent variable; treatment, visit, and 
treatment­by­visit interaction as fixed effects; and patient 
as a random effect, with adjustment for weight (<25 kg vs 
≥25 kg), ppFEV1 severity (<90 vs ≥90), and baseline LCI2∙5 as 
a continuous variable.
The primary result obtained from the MMRM model was 
the treatment effect averaged from each study visit until 
week 24. The target sample size of 200 patients was mainly 
driven by population size and feasibility considerations. 
Power calculations and MMRMs for secondary endpoints 
are detailed in the appendix. This study was registered with 
ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02514473.

Results
Between July 23, 2015, and Sept 20, 2016, 206 patients 
were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive 
lumacaftor and ivacaftor (n=104) or placebo (n=102). 
204 patients received at least one dose of study drug 
(103 lumacaftor and ivacaftor, 101 placebo; figure 1). 
97 (94%) of 103 patients in the lumacaftor and ivacaftor 
group and 96 (95%) of 101 patients in the placebo group 
completed 24 weeks of treatment. Treatment dis­
continuation due to adverse events (respiration abnormal; 
elevated aminotransferases) occurred in three (3%) of 
103 patients in the lumacaftor and ivacaftor group and 
two (2%) of 101 patients in the placebo group. Compliance 
percentage over 80% with medication (calculated as 
100 × [total days continuous medication/duration of total 
exposure]) was high in both groups: 97·9% with 
lumacaftor and ivacaftor and 99·7% with placebo.
Baseline characteristics were generally similar across 
the two treatment groups (table 1). Mean baseline ppFEV1 
was slightly lower in the lumacaftor and ivacaftor group 
and approximately one half of patients in the study had 
ppFEV1 of 90 or more, representing a population with well 
preserved lung function. In the placebo group, a higher 
proportion of patients received inhaled antibiotics and 
inhaled corticosteroids, and a lower proportion received 
inhaled hypertonic saline prior to study day 1 compared 
with the lumacaftor and ivacaftor group.
There was a statistically significant within­group average 
absolute improvement from baseline in LCI2∙5 up to and 
including week 24 (least squares mean −1∙01, 95% CI 
−1∙27 to −0∙75; p<0.0001) among patients treated with 
lumacaftor and ivacaftor. The change from baseline in the 
placebo group was not significant (0∙08, 95% CI 
−0∙18 to 0∙34; p=0·5390). The difference between the 
lumacaftor and ivacaftor and placebo groups was 
significant (p<0·0001); these improvements in LCI2∙5 were 
apparent by day 15 of active treatment and were sustained 
throughout the remaining study visits (figure 2).
Average absolute change from baseline in sweat 
chloride concentration (at day 15 and week 4) was 
significant in lumacaftor­treated and ivacaftor­treated 
patients (within­group least squares mean −20∙0, 95% CI 
−22∙0 to −18∙1; p<0·0001, table 2), as was the treatment 
difference versus placebo (least squares mean difference 
−20∙8, 95% CI −23∙4 to −18∙2; p<0·0001). Significant 
reductions in sweat chloride concentrations versus 
placebo were observed at day 15 of lumacaftor and 
ivacaftor treatment and all subsequent visits (figure 3A).
Significant increases in BMI from baseline were 
observed in both groups at week 24 (figure 3B) and in 
BMI­for­age Z score in the lumacaftor and ivacaftor 
group, but treatment differences did not reach signifi­
cance for either measure (table 2). CFQ­R respiratory 
domain scores were improved over baseline through 
week 24 in both groups, and the difference observed 
between the groups was not significant (table 2, 
figure 3C).
Absolute change from baseline in ppFEV1 averaged 
through week 24 was not significant in either treatment 
group. In the placebo group, within­group ppFEV1 was 
less than baseline at all visits, but in the lumacaftor and 
ivacaftor group, mean ppFEV1 did not fall below baseline 
at any study visit (figure 3D). The between­group 
difference in absolute change in ppFEV1 averaged 
through week 24 was significant in favour of lumacaftor 
and ivacaftor (least squares mean difference vs 
placebo 2∙4, 95% CI 0∙4–4∙4; p=0.0182, table 2).

One patient in the placebo group had FE­1 more than 
200 µg/g stool (considered the cutoff for exocrine 
pancreatic sufficiency) at baseline and week 24, and one 
patient in the lumacaftor and ivacaftor group had FE­1 
more than 200 µg/g stool at week 24 and less than 15 µg/g 
stool at baseline. All other patients with measurements 
at baseline and week 24 had FE­1 concentrations less 
than 200 µg/g stool at both visits. Further details are 
provided in the appendix.
Adverse events were reported in 196 (96%) of 
204 patients; in most patients, these were mild (43%) or 
moderate (48%) in severity. The proportion of patients 
reporting adverse events was similar in the treatment 
and placebo groups (table 3), with cough being the 
most common adverse event (46 [45%] of 103 in the 
lumacaftor and ivacaftor group and 47 [47%] of 101 in 
the placebo group). Productive cough, nasal congestion, 
oropharyngeal pain, upper abdominal pain, rhinorrhea, 
and sputum increased were observed more frequently 
in the lumacaftor and ivacaftor treatment group than in 
the placebo group.
Serious adverse events were reported in 13 (13%) of 
103 patients in the lumacaftor and ivacaftor group and 
were considered related to study drug in two patients 
(one drug interaction, one obstructive airways disorder). 
11 (11%) of 101 patients in the placebo group reported 
serious adverse events, which were considered treatment­
related in three (one distal intestinal obstruction 
syndrome, two elevated aminotransferases). There were 
no deaths during the study period. Respiratory events 
were reported in 19 (18%) of 103 patients in the lumacaftor 
and 
ivacaftor 
group 
(six 
respiration 
abnormal, 
five dyspnoea, five wheezing, four asthma) and 13 (13%) 
of 101 in the placebo group (five dyspnoea, four respiration 
abnormal, three wheezing, one chest discomfort, 
one asthma; some patients had more than one respiratory 
event). Respiratory events occurred within the first week 
of study treatment in eight patients in the lumacaftor and 
ivacaftor group and six patients in the placebo group; 
events resolved within 2 weeks of onset in six of the 
patients in the treatment group and five of the patients in 
the placebo group. One (1%) of 103 patients in the

lumacaftor and ivacaftor group had a respiratory event 
(respiration abnormal) that led to interruption (at study 
day 6) and discontinuation (at study day 9) of treatment. 
At day 1, a short­term, post­dose ppFEV1 decline was 
observed in patients receiving lumacaftor and ivacaftor, 
but this was generally asymptomatic with few concurrent 
respiratory events (table 4). A markedly smaller decline 
was observed post­dose at day 15, and no decline was 
observed by week 16.

of 103) than in the placebo group (eight [8%] of 101). 
Eight patients had elevations more than five times the 
upper limit of normal (five [5%] of 103 patients receiving 
lumacaftor and ivacaftor, three [3%] of 101 patients 
receiving placebo), and three patients had elevations 
more than eight times the upper limit of normal (one [1%] 
of 103 patients in the lumacaftor and ivacaftor group, 
two [2%] of 101 patients in the placebo group). All of 
these elevations were isolated without concomitant 
elevations in bilirubin.
There were no meaningful changes in vital signs, 
including blood pressure (appendix), in patients treated 
with lumacaftor and ivacaftor compared with patients 
given placebo.
Discussion
In this placebo­controlled study, combination lumacaftor 
and ivacaftor treatment decreased LCI2∙5 and sweat 
chloride concentrations, maintained spirometric lung 
function, and was well tolerated in patients aged 
6–11 years with cystic fibrosis homozygous for the 
F508del-CFTR mutation.
Patients receiving lumacaftor and ivacaftor had 
statistically significant improvement in LCI2∙5 based on the 
average decrease from baseline across all study visits and a 
significant treatment effect versus placebo. The magnitude 
of both the within­group improvement, a reduction 
of −1∙01, and the between­group treatment difference 
versus placebo, −1∙09, observed in this study are similar to 
findings in the previous open­label study in paediatric 
patients (−0∙86 at day 15, −1∙08 at week 4, and −0∙88 at 
week 24).13 The improvement observed in this study is also 
similar in magnitude to the effect described with 
hypertonic saline25 and dornase alfa,26 albeit using a 
different inert gas to measure LCI2·5 (sulfur hexafluoride, 
as opposed to nitrogen­based multiple­breath washout). It 
should be noted that patients in this study were permitted 
to continue receiving their existing medications during the 
study period, including dornase alfa and hypertonic saline. 
This suggests that the effect of lumacaftor and ivacaftor on 
LCI2·5 would have occured over and above any improvement 
caused by hypertonic saline or dornase alfa in patients 
receiving these drugs. The magnitude of effect on LCI2·5 
was smaller than that observed in a phase 2 study of 
ivacaftor, also done in patients aged 6 years or older 
but with at least one G551D-CFTR mutation (−2∙07 at 
4 weeks);27 a greater beneficial effect of ivacaftor on 
spirometry and other efficacy measures was also reported 
in the phase 2 trial than was observed in this study.

In this and previous studies,13 children aged 6–11 years 
with cystic fibrosis generally had well preserved 
spirometry. Although FEV1 has been the standard for 
clinical trial assessments in cystic fibrosis, evidence has 
suggested that LCI2∙5 is more sensitive to the presence of 
early structural lung abnormalities associated with cystic 
fibrosis, particularly in younger patients.18,19 LCI2∙5 is 
considered a reliable, well validated, and responsive 
clinical endpoint measure,28 and treatment effects with 
hypertonic saline,25 dornase alfa,26 ivacaftor,27 and 
lumacaftor and ivacaftor13 have been detected using LCI2∙5 
in paediatric patients with cystic fibrosis. Elevated LCI2∙5 
values reflect increasing unevenness of gas mixing within 
the lung that is a consequence of early lung disease in 
cystic fibrosis (eg, secondary to mucus plugging and 
airway wall changes such as bronchiectasis).29 To our 
knowledge, this study represents the first time that LCI2∙5 
has been used as a primary outcome measure in a large 
multicentre phase 3 trial.
Consistent with known characteristics of patients with 
cystic fibrosis homozygous for F508del-CFTR30 and with 
data from our previous phase 3 open­label study in 
paediatric patients,13 sweat chloride measurements at 
baseline were 100 mmol/L or more. We observed a 
decrease in sweat chloride concentration versus baseline 
in patients treated with lumacaftor and ivacaftor that was 
apparent from day 15 and persisted throughout the study; 
no decrease was observed in patients given placebo. The 
magnitude, rapid onset, and durability of this effect are all 
in accordance with findings from our previous paediatric 
open­label trial13 and in adult patients with advanced lung 
disease31 (sweat chloride concentration was not measured 
in the TRAFFIC and TRANSPORT trials) and provide 
further evidence that combination lumacaftor and ivacaftor 
therapy increases CFTR activity in patients homozygous 
for F508del.
An increase in mean CFQ­R respiratory domain score 
from baseline was observed in the lumacaftor and 
ivacaftor group (5∙5 points). This increase is consistent 
with changes observed in the phase 3 open­label study in 
paediatric patients,13 and exceeds the minimal clinically 
important difference in cystic fibrosis populations 
(4∙0 points) determined from analyses of two open­label 
studies of tobramycin in patients with cystic fibrosis.32 
However, it was not significantly different from that 
observed in patients who received placebo (3∙0 points).
Mean baseline ppFEV1 in the study population 
was 89∙8, and approximately one half of patients had 
ppFEV1 of 90 or above, representing well preserved 
spirometric lung function. This is in contrast to the 
TRAFFIC/TRANSPORT 
studies, 
in 
which 
mean 
baseline ppFEV1 was 61, and most patients had 
measurements less than 70.12 Significant improvement 
over baseline was not detected in patients receiving 
lumacaftor and ivacaftor. However, there was a treatment 
difference in ppFEV1 compared with placebo patients in 
this study; ppFEV1 remained stable in the lumacaftor 
and ivacaftor group but declined in the placebo group. 
This finding is consistent with the previous observation 
in older patients that lumacaftor and ivacaftor has a 
disease­modifying effect on the progressive decline in 
lung function associated with cystic fibrosis.33 This 
conclusion is of particular importance in paediatric 
patients for whom preservation of lung function is a 
primary goal in clinical practice.
Nutritional status is an important consideration in 
young patients, as measures of nutrition in the normal 
range are associated with better pulmonary function and 
survival in adults and children with cystic fibrosis.34 
Similar to observations from the open­label paediatric 
study,13 patients receiving lumacaftor and ivacaftor 
showed significant increase in BMI over the course of 
this study. However, there was no significant treatment 
effect versus placebo; patients in the placebo group also 
showed significant improvement in BMI during the 
study period. Outcomes such as BMI and CFQ­R are well 
preserved, and we hypothesise that detection of response 
might be limited by ceiling effects.
Elastase secreted from the pancreas remains intact 
during its passage through the intestine, and its 
concentration in faeces (FE­1) provides a reliable diagnostic 
test for pancreatic function in patients with cystic fibrosis,35 
with concentrations above 200 µg/g stool considered the 
cutoff for exocrine pancreatic sufficiency. Most patients 
homozygous for F508del-CFTR have FE­1 concentrations 
less than the capacity of our detection method (15 µg/g 
stool).36 In our study, 12 (15%) of 78 patients had detectable 
con 
centrations of FE­1 at week 24 of lumacaftor 
and ivacaftor treatment, compared with four (5%) 
of 75 receiving placebo; five (6%) of 78 patients in the 
lumacaftor and ivacaftor group and four (5%) of 75 patients 
in the placebo group had detectable concentrations at 
baseline. 90 patients in the lumacaftor and ivacaftor group 
were assessed for FE­1, but only 78 had non­missing 
records at baseline and week 24. Similarly, 92 were 
assessed in the placebo group, but only 75 had non­
missing records at baseline and week 24. Only one patient 
in each group had FE­1 more than 200 µg/g stool at the 
end of the study (appendix). Although increased FE­1 has 
been seen with modulator therapy in other cystic fibrosis 
genotypes,37 further exploration of the effect of CFTR 
modulators on exocrine pancreatic function, particularly 
for younger patients in whom pancreatic damage is not 
established, is warranted.
In previous phase 3 studies of lumacaftor and ivacaftor 
in patients with cystic fibrosis aged at least 12 years 
homozygous 
for 
F508del-CFTR, 
treatment 
with 
lumacaftor and ivacaftor was generally safe and well 
tolerated.12,33 The most common adverse events were 
typical for patients with cystic fibrosis. There was an 
imbalance in early respiratory events; these events were 
generally mild to moderate in severity and resolved 
without interrupting treatment. An imbalance in 
serious adverse events associated with liver function

was seen in these previous studies, and increased blood 
pressure was observed in some patients, although no 
adverse events related to increased blood pressure were 
reported. The safety profile for lumacaftor and ivacaftor 
in our study was generally consistent with these 
observations, although there were no meaningful 
changes in blood pressure and onset of respiratory 
events was less associated with lumacaftor and ivacaftor 
initiation. 
Most adverse events were respiratory or infective and 
were reported for both lumacaftor and ivacaftor and 
placebo groups. However, productive cough, nasal 
congestion, oropharyngeal pain, upper abdominal pain, 
rhinorrhea, and sputum increased were observed more 
frequently in the lumacaftor and ivacaftor treatment 
group than in the placebo group. Of 204 patients, 
two treated with lumacaftor and ivacaftor and 
three receiving placebo had serious adverse events that 
were considered to be related to study treatment. The 
incidence of respiratory events was 18% in patients 
receiving lumacaftor and ivacaftor in this study, versus 
13% in patients receiving placebo, and onset was not 
associated with treatment initiation to the same extent as 
was observed in TRAFFIC, TRANSPORT, and the 
open­label extension of these two trials (PROGRESS).12,33
Initiation of lumacaftor and ivacaftor combination 
therapy in the study population was well tolerated, and 
although a post­dose decline in ppFEV1 was observed 
during the first week following initiation, this resolved 
with continuing treatment.
The rate of abnormal aminotransferase values in this 
study population was similar to that seen in patients of the 
same age group in the previous open­label study in patients 
with cystic fibrosis homozygous for F508del-CFTR,13 but 
higher than that observed in older patients.12 Alanine 
aminotransferase or aspartate aminotransferase elevations 
more than 3 times the upper limit of normal were observed 
in 13% of patients from the lumacaftor and ivacaftor group 
in this study compared with 5% of the patients treated with 
lumacaftor and ivacaftor in the TRAFFIC/TRANSPORT 
trials12; 8% of patients in the placebo group in our study 
showed elevations above 3 times the upper limit of normal. 
Overall, the higher rate of aminotransferase elevations in 
younger patients was generally consistent with expected 
outcomes in paediatric patients with cystic fibrosis who are 
known to have a high background rate of aminotransferase 
abnormalities.38
Our trial is limited by the highly controlled and 
monitored context common to all clinical studies. In 
addition, our trial employed the multiple­breath washout 
measurement, LCI2∙5, as the primary endpoint. To our 
knowledge, LCI2∙5 has not been previously used as the 
primary endpoint in a large multicentre clinical trial. 
In conclusion, this study has shown that lumacaftor 
and ivacaftor improved LCI2∙5, a sensitive measure of 
early cystic fibrosis­related lung disease and ventilatory 
distribution abnormalities, compared with placebo in 
paediatric patients with cystic fibrosis homozygous for 
F508del­CFTR. Sweat chloride concentration was also 
significantly improved (decreased) versus placebo, 
lending mechanistic validation to the pulmonary 
findings as it represents an improvement in CFTR 
function in response to modulator therapy. Although 
ppFEV1 did not change significantly from baseline in 
either group, there was a significant treatment effect 
reflecting preservation of lung function with lumacaftor 
and ivacaftor and functional decline, even in the 
relatively short period of 24 weeks, with placebo. Taken 
together, these findings support the need for early 
initiation of treatment. The safety profile of lumacaftor 
and ivacaftor was generally consistent with that observed 
in previous phase 3 studies.
