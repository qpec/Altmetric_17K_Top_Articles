Abstract 
Troodontid material from the Maastrichtian of North America is extremely rare, beyond 
isolated teeth from microvertebrate sites. Here we describe troodontid frontals from the early 
Maastrichtian Horseshoe Canyon Formation (Horsethief Member). The most complete specimen, 
TMP 1993.105.01, is notably foreshortened and robust when compared to numerous specimens 
referred to Troodon from the Dinosaur Park Formation, and exhibits several characteristics that 
distinguish it from other Late Cretaceous troodontids. Morphometric analyses reinforce shape 
differences between TMP 1993.105.01 and other North America troodontids, and show that 
proportional differences are independent of size. We therefore erect a new taxon, Albertavenator 
curriei gen. et. sp. nov., that is diagnosed by the following autapomorphies: 1) primary 
supraciliary foramen is truncated anteriorly by the lacrimal contact, 2) superficial (ectocranial) 
surface of the frontal proportionally shorter than all known troodontids, with a length to width 
ratio under 1.25, and 3) frontoparietal contact in which an enlarged lappet of the frontal extends 
medially to extensively overlap the lateral region of the anteromedial process of the parietal. 
Interestingly, tooth and jaw morphology from the single relatively complete dentary recovered 
from the Horseshoe Canyon cannot be distinguished from dentaries and teeth from the Dinosaur 
Park Formation. If the dentary and teeth from the Horsethief Member of the Horseshoe Canyon 
Formation prove to belong to A. curriei, extensive overlap in tooth morphology between the 
Dinosaur Park and Horseshoe Canyon formations reinforce the notion that tooth morphotypes do 
not exhibit strong correspondence to species alpha diversity, and may encompass multiple 
closely-related taxa.

Introduction 
 
Troodontidae is a clade of small maniraptoran theropod dinosaurs that occurs in 
Late Jurassic through end Cretaceous deposits of Laurasia (Makovicky and Norell 2004). 
Troodontids from the Late Cretaceous of North America are poorly known and have a complex 
taxonomic history (for reviews, see Currie 1987b; Currie and Koppelhus 2005; Zanno et al. 
2011). Since the discovery of Troodon formosus, named on the basis of an isolated tooth from 
the Judith River Formation (Leidy 1856), only four species have been formally named based on 
material recovered from North America: T. formosus (Judith River Formation, Montana), 
Stenonychosaurus inequalis (Dinosaur Park Formation, Alberta), Pectinodon bakkeri (Lance 
Formation, Wyoming) and Talos sampsoni (Kaiparowits Formation, Utah). Little skeletal 
material has been described, and skull material is particularly rare (Carpenter 1982; Fiorillo et al. 
2009; Makovicky and Norell 2004; Russell 1969; Zanno et al. 2011), hindering assessments for 
taxonomic diversity in the group. Despite this, isolated troodontid teeth are relatively common 
through the Campanian and Maastrichtian of western North America (Cullen and Evans 2016; 
Larson et al. 2016; Larson and Currie 2013). Historically, the genus Troodon has been reported 
to occur throughout the Campanian and Maastrichtian, and across most of western North 
America (Makovicky and Norell 2004), based on referrals of isolated teeth and the few, and 
generally fragmentary, available fossils (Zanno et al. 2011). More recently, some researchers 
have recognized T. formosus as a form taxon based on potentially non-diagnostic tooth 
morphology, and suggested that the taxon may contain multiple species or genera (Fiorillo et al. 
2008, 2009). Zanno et al. (2011) noted morphological variation in materials previously referred 
to this taxon, and hypothesized that the diversity of Late Cretaceous troodontids in North 
    
4   
America is presently underestimated due to over-synonymization based on fragmentary material, 
and predicted that closer examination of this material may reveal hidden taxonomic diversity. In 
a subsequent morphometric study of isolated small theropod teeth from the latest Cretaceous of 
western North America, Larson and Currie (2013) also concluded that their diversity is 
underestimated, and that T. formosus sensu stricto is only definitively known from the Judith 
River and Dinosaur Park formations, implying teeth from other units may represent distinct taxa. 
Troodontid material from the Maastrichtian of North America is particularly rare, beyond 
isolated teeth from microvertebrate sites (e.g. Larson and Currie 2013). Previous reports include 
two troodontid braincases referred to Troodon formosus from the Prince Creek Formation of 
Alaska (Fiorillo 2008; Fiorillo et al. 2009), and a perinate dentary and basioccipital from the 
Lance Formation (Carpenter 1982). Troodontid cranial material has also been recovered from the 
Horsethief Member of the Horseshoe Canyon Formation of Alberta (Eberth et al. 2013), which is 
now classified as early Maastrichtian in age (Gradstein et al. 2012). Currie (1987a) described a 
relatively complete dentary (TMP 1983.012.0011) and tentatively referred it to Troodon 
formosus. Eberth et al (2013) listed two undescribed troodontid frontals recovered from this unit, 
which represent the only reported frontals of this clade from the Maastrichtian of North America. 
Together with the previously described dentary (Currie 1987a), these constitute all of the non-
dental troodontid remains from the formation, and some of the only non-dental troodontid 
remains from the Maaastrichtian of North America (Carpenter 1982; Fiorillo et al. 2009). 
Frontals are generally diagnostic to low taxonomic levels in deinonychosaurs (Averianov 2016; 
Bell and Currie 2016; Currie 1987b; Evans et al. 2014), and may be useful in distinguishing 
troodontid taxa (Zanno et al. 2013; Zanno et al. 2011). Here we describe the troodontid frontals 
from the Horseshoe Canyon Formation and compare them with other Late Cretaceous 
    
5   
troodontids. Comparison of the Horseshoe Canyon Formation frontals to numerous specimens 
belonging to Troodon from the Dinosaur Park Formation, as well as other Late Cretaceous 
troodontids, suggest that these Horseshoe Canyon Formation frontals can be distinguished and 
recognized as a new taxon, Albertavenator curriei gen. et sp. nov. This corroborates predictions 
that troodontid diversity in the latest Cretaceous of North America is underestimated due to over-
synonymization of fragmentary material (Zanno et al. 2011), and suggests that more detailed 
studies of collections from the latest Cretaceous of northern Laramidia may reveal more, 
currently unrecognized taxa.

Materials and Methods  
The taxonomy of the genus Troodon has been historically complex (for reviews, see 
Currie 1987, 2005; Zanno et al. 2011). Here, we refer to the material collected from the Dinosaur 
Park Formation as Troodon inequalis, following Currie (2005). Furthermore, the frontals from 
the Dinosaur Park Formation can be linked directly to the holotype foot of Stenonychosaurus 
(=Troodon) inequalis (Sternberg 1932) through the most complete associated skeleton (CMN 
12340) collected from the same unit, which includes skull and pedal material, but no teeth 
    
6   
(Russell 1969). Because the genotype of Troodon is an isolated tooth (Leidy 1856) from 
potentially co-eval beds of the Judith River Formation (Mallon et al. 2016), it remains possible 
that T. inequalis is a junior synonym of T. formosus since teeth collected from the Dinosaur Park 
Formation and Judith River Formation are morphologically indistinguishable (Larson and Currie 
2013). However, whether or not this type of tooth morphology is diagnostic to the species-level 
will require more complete material from both formations. When making comparisons between 
the Horseshoe Canyon and Dinosaur Park formations, we refer to specimen numbers where 
appropriate (e.g., Zanno et al. 2011), but for the sake of brevity in the discussion, T. inequalis 
refers only to material from the Dinosaur Park Formation. We also recognize the possibility that 
more than one taxon may be present in the sample from the Dinosaur Park Formation. If more 
than one taxon is present, it would only inflate the range of individual variation we are using to 
assess the distinctiveness of the Horseshoe Canyon material, thereby providing a robust test. 
First hand morphological comparisons were made between frontals and dentaries referred 
to Troodontidae from the Horseshoe Canyon and Dinosaur Park formations. The more complete 
of the two Horseshoe Canyon Formation frontals, TMP 1993.105.0001, was compared to nine 
frontals referred to Troodon inequalis from the Dinosaur Park Formation of Alberta, and one 
troodontid frontal from the Kaiparowits Formation of Utah in a series of morphometric analyses 
(Table 1). Comparisons to Asian troodontid taxa relied upon published descriptions. The frontal 
length to width ratio in Zanabazar and Gobivenator were calculated from published photographs 
in Norell et al. (2009) and Tsuihiji et al. (2014) respectively. 
In order to quantitatively determine the range of morphological variation present in North 
American troodontid frontals, we used several morphometric methods. To this end, six 
landmarks (Appendices 1-2) were identified on the dorsal surface of each frontal for 2-D 
    
7   
geometric morphometric analyses. Landmarks were selected based on two main criteria: 1) 
homologous points and/or multiple sutural intersections (sensu Bookstein 1997), and 2) being 
present on the available specimens. The latter criterion limited the placement of landmarks on 
the postorbital process and the delicate anterior flange, which are unfortunately broken on both 
Horseshoe Canyon Formation frontals. While methods do exist to estimate missing points in 
geometric morphometric analyses (Arbour and Brown 2014), we were concerned that the 
proportional dominance of T. inequalis in the sample relative to the Horseshoe Canyon form 
would bias the estimated landmarks in a way that minimizes morphological variation between 
potentially different species. Landmark data were collected and geometric morphometric 
analyses, including Procrustes superimposition and Principal Component Analyses (PCA), 
performed using the ‘geomorph’ package (Adams and Otárola-Castillo 2013) in the R 
programming language (Appendix 5).  
Linear measurements (Table 1, Appendix 1, Appendix 3) were taken from a sample of 
troodontid frontals from North America for comparisons that supplement the geometric 
morphometric analyses. This series of measurements allows for a multivariate linear Principal 
Component Analysis (PCA) and for bivariate tests of size-related (e.g, ontogenetic) allometry to 
be performed (Appendix 5). Reduced Major Axis line fitting was used to describe the 
relationship between linear measurement variables, and Ordinary Least Squares regression was 
used to plot PC scores against brain length (Legendre and Legendre 2012). 
 
Isolated troodontid teeth from the Horseshoe Canyon, Dinosaur Park, and Judith River 
formations were also compared quantitatively. Data was taken from Larson et al. (2016) and 
updated with data from Torices et al. (2014) with modifications to some of the identifications 
(Appendices 6-7) (Larson et al. 2016; Torices et al. 2014). Dental variables analyzed include 
    
8   
fore-aft basal length (FABL), crown height (CH), basal width (BW), mesial denticle length 
(ADL), and distal denticle length, (PDL). Analyses (Appendix 8) were run in R (R-
Development-Core-Team 2015) using the core stats and BiodiversityR packages (Kindt and Coe 
2008). These two datasets also separate teeth by positional variation, with posterior dentary teeth 
in North American troodontids lacking denticles, unlike the remainder of the tooth positions 
(Currie et al. 1990; Currie 1987a; Longrich 2008b). Specimens were grouped into two analyses 
based on whether or not they possessed mesial denticles because when analyzed together, this 
trait systematically separates specimens into two groups, and we did not want to exclude mesial 
denticle measurements from the analysis. Previous studies (Larson et al. 2016) have shown that 
the teeth from the Dinosaur Park and Horseshoe Canyon formations differ in average size. For 
the purposes of this study, we wanted to test for differences between the specimens from the 
Horseshoe Canyon, Dinosaur Park, and Judith River formations based on aspects of shape 
independent of size. The mesial denticles dataset was size-standardized using residuals that were 
calculated for CH, BW, ADL, and PDL by regressing log-transformed variables against FABL 
using ordinary least squares regression. Residuals for the dataset without mesial denticles were 
conducted in the same way but with ADL excluded. Residuals in the two analyses were analyzed 
using PCA, and significant variables were calculated using the broken stick method (Frontier 
1976; Jackson 1993). Welch two-sample t-tests were conducted on the scores of the significant 
axes of the Dinosaur Park and Horseshoe Canyon teeth. Convex hulls were calculated to include 
95% of specimens closest to the mean of each group along the significant separating axis of each 
analysis. 
Additionally, the eigenvectors of the PCA were used to project in situ teeth from two 
dentaries into the analyses (Appendix 4, Appendix 7). The dentary TMP 1983.012.0011 was 
    
9   
recovered from the Horseshoe Canyon Formation and preserves three germ teeth, two of which 
were projected into the dataset with mesial denticles PCA, and one of which was projected into 
the dataset without mesial denticles PCA. ROM 1445 preserves two dentary teeth, both of which 
were projected into the dataset without mesial denticles PCA.

Etymology. The generic name refers to the Canadian province of Alberta, combined with the 
Latin ‘venator’, for hunter. The species epithet honours Philip J. Currie, who has worked 
extensively on the Late Cretaceous theropods of Alberta and whose work on the similarities 
between troodontids and birds advanced the study of paravians. 
 
Locality and Horizon. All specimens were recovered from the Horsethief Member of the 
Horseshoe Canyon Formation, within the stratigraphic interval of coal zones 7 through 9 (Eberth 
and Braman 2012; Eberth et al. 2013) (Figure 1). The holotype frontal, TMP 1993.105.0001 
(Figure 2), was discovered 25 m northeast of the Day Digs Bleriot Ferry Edmontosaurus 
Bonebed (see Evans et al. 2015), located close to the Bleriot Ferry crossing of the Red Deer 
River, approximately 22 km northwest of the Town of Drumheller. Stratigraphically, the 
specimen occurs at the level of coal zone 8 (Eberth et al. 2013; Evans et al. 2015). The referred 
frontal, TMP 1996.005.0008 (Figure 3), was collected near Morrin Bridge, at the level of coal 
zones 8-9, also within the Horsethief Member. Detailed locality data for each specimen is on file 
at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology. 
Age. The Horsethief Member of the Horseshoe Canyon Formation occurs within the 32n 
magnetochron interval, and has an estimated age of ∼71.5–71.0 Ma (Eberth and Braman 2012; 
Eberth et al. 2013). Based on this chronostratigraphic age, this unit is considered earliest 
Maastrichtian in age (Gradstein et al. 2012). 
Diagnosis. Large troodontid diagnosed by the following autapomorphies: 1) primary supraciliary 
foramen is truncated anteriorly by the lacrimal contact, 2) superficial (ectocranial) surface of the 
frontal proportionally shorter than all known troodontids, with a length to width ratio less than 
1.3, and 3) a frontoparietal contact in which an enlarged lappet of the frontal extends medially to 
    
11   
extensively overlap the lateral region of the interfrontal (anterior) process of the parietal. 
 
Comments: The incomplete right frontal, TMP 1996.005.0008, is considerably smaller than the 
holotype, but can be referred to Albertavenator curriei based on the presence of an enlarged 
lappet of the frontal that extends medially to extensively overlap the lateral region of the 
interfrontal (anterior) process of the parietal, an autapomorphy of A. curriei (see discussion 
below). An almost complete left dentary with several in situ teeth, TMP 1983.012.0011, 
described by Currie (1987a) is from the TMP bonebed HC 1 locality in Midland Provincial Park 
(LSD 11, Sec. 17, Twp. 29, Rge. 20, W 4th) and occurs slightly lower within the Horsethief 
Member, at the level of coal zones 7-8 (Eberth et al. 2013).While it might be tempting to assign 
TMP 1983.012.0011 to A. curriei, based on its generally consistent troodontid morphology, size, 
and stratigraphic occurrence, we refrain from doing so formally since its dental and jaw 
morphology cannot be distinguished from material collected from Dinosaur Provincial Park 
(Currie 1987a; see below). We discuss the implications of a potential referral of this specimen to 
A. curriei below.  
 
Description. 
Holotype. TMP 1993.105.0001 is an incomplete left frontal (Figure 2), lacking the 
postorbital ramus and a segment of the central orbital rim. The frontal preserves the sutural 
surfaces for the nasal anteriorly, the lacrimal anterolaterally, and postorbital posterolaterally, the 
parietal posteriorly, and the complementary frontal medially. In dorsal view, the frontal is 
triangular in outline as preserved, resembling a right-angled triangle that is longer than it is wide, 
with an almost straight medial margin that meets its counterpart medially. Based on the 
    
12   
posteriormost preserved portion of the orbital rim, it is clear that the frontal was “L-shaped” 
when complete, as in troodontids. This is in contrast to the generally ‘T-shaped’ frontals of 
dromaeosaurids (Evans et al. 2014; Makovicky and Norell 2004). The dorsal surface is 
dominated by a broad, parasagitally oriented groove that extends from the posterior end of the 
nasal suture towards the supratemporal ridge. This groove is often cited as a distinctive 
characteristic of troodontids (Evans et al. 2014; Makovicky and Norell 2004), and contrasts with 
the flat condition seen in adult dromaeosaurids (Norell and Makovicky 2004) and ornithomimids 
(Currie 1987b; Longrich 2008a), and the weakly concave frontals of therizinosaurs (Averianov 
2016; Averianov and Sues 2016). Laterally, this groove defines a strongly upturned orbital rim. 
The rim appears to be elevated in TMP 1993.105.0001 to an even greater degree than other 
troodontid specimens, such as TMP 1993.036.0086 (Figure 4), although it is possible that this is 
accentuated by taphonomic compression. The ratio of the length of the frontal (measured from 
the midline parietal contact to the posterior end of the nasal contact) to its width (measured from 
the midline to the medial extent of the postorbital contact) is 1.22 in TMP 1993.105.0001, 
whereas it ranges from 1.4 to 1.6 in Troodon frontals from the Dinosaur Park Formation. This 
ratio is 1.7 in the troodontid frontal from the Kaiparowits formation (Zanno et al. 2013). The 
frontal tends to be relatively more elongate in Asian troodontids. This ratio is 1.56 in 
Gobivenator (Tsuihiji et al. 2014), and 1.75 in Zanabazar junior (Norell et al. 2009). The length 
of the frontal is reported to be approximately twice that of its width in Linhevenator (Xu et al. 
2011).  
Anteriorly, the sutural surface of the nasal contact is wide along the anterolateral margin 
of the frontal, indicating that the nasal overlapped the frontal considerably in this region. The 
posterior periphery of the nasal contact has a series of distinct ridges indicating strong 
    
13   
interdigitation with the nasal along the posterior edge of the suture, a feature that is not as 
pronounced in other troodontid frontals such as TMP 1986.049.0010 or TMP 1993.036.0086 
(Figure 4). The lacrimal contact is located posterolaterally to the nasal contact, as in other 
specimens of Troodon inequalis. However, the lacrimal contact extends farther posteriorly than 
in other troodontid specimens examined, and does not meet the orbital rim. Rather, it intersects 
with a large foramen located along to the orbital rim, that we hypothesize is homologous to a 
large foramen that occurs posterior to the lacrimal contact and communicates obliquely with the 
orbit in all other troodontid frontals. This foramen, termed here as the primary supraciliary 
foramen, occurs 4.5 mm posterior to the lacrimal contact in CMN 12340, 8.4 mm TMP 
1986.049.0010, and 5.5 mm posterior to this contact in TMP 1993.036.0086. In specimens from 
the Dinosaur Park Formation, the primary supraciliary foramen is variable in size within the 
sample, and can be asymmetrically developed (e.g., CMN 12340), but occurs within the 
irregular, rugose bone directly adjacent to the orbital margin, where it is typically associated with 
a small notch but does not communicate directly with the orbit in dorsal view. Although this 
region of bone is often perforated by small formina, this large foramen is easily identifiable in 
most specimens, and we suggest it is homologus landmark that reflects the passage of 
neurovasculature. A large foramen in a similar location is present in UMNH.VP.16303, and in 
the holotype of Zanabazar junior (IGM 100/1) from the Nemegt Formation of Mongolia (Norell 
et al. 2009: Fig 24b, right side). However, in TMP 1993.105.0001 the primary supraciliary 
foramen is open anteriorly, presumably towards the lacrimal, and laterally in the direction of the 
orbital rim, indicating that this foramen was bound anteriorly by the lacrimal, whereas it is 
completely enclosed by the frontal where this feature can be identified in other troodontids. On 
the ventral surface of TMP 1993.105.0001, a transversely oriented groove extends medially from 
    
14   
the ventral aperture of the foramen towards the crista cranii, across the surface of the orbital 
cavity. A similar groove is preserved in CMN 12340 and TMP 1993.036.0086, but is not present 
TMP 1986.049.0010, where the primary supraciliary foramen is relatively smaller. As in other 
specimens examined, several small foramina located posteromedially to the primary supraciliary 
foramen pierce the dorsal surface of the frontal and communicate with the orbit ventrally. 
 
Posteriorly, the supratemporal ridge traverses the frontal at approximately a right angle to 
the medial interfrontal suture. The well-demarcated ridge, which is bounded anteriorly by a fine 
groove, extends from the parietal contact at the midline to the broken edge at the base of the 
postorbital process. Posterior to the supratemporal ridge, the frontal forms a subvertical, slightly 
mediolaterally convex supratemporal fossa. Medially, the supratemporal ridge terminates at the 
anteromedial region of the rugose contact surface for the parietal. The contact surface for the 
parietal is located along the entire posterior margin of the frontal. The parietal contact also lies 
on the ventral surface of the frontal at its lateral extreme, and extends towards the dorsal surface 
towards the midline. Here a dorsal process is wedged between the posteromedial corners of the 
paired frontals. The frontoparietal contact in this region has an enlarged lappet of the frontal that 
extends medially to extensively overlap the lateral region of the anteromedial process of the 
parietal. This differs from the more finely striated, roughened parietal suture seen in this region 
in the sample of frontals from Dinosaur Provincial Park (e.g, TMP 1986.049.0010, TMP 
1993.036.0086). Unfortunately, this region cannot be compared to most named Asian 
troodontids, which are represented by articulated skulls.  
In ventral view, the forebrain fossae are bound laterally by the crista cranii, which 
projects ventrally to separate the orbit from the endocranial cavity. The olfactory bulb impression 
is large and ovoid, with the long axis oriented parasagitally. The olfactory tracts are long, and 
    
15   
extend from the posterior end of the bulb fossa to the anterior end of the globular cerebral fossa, 
which loosely mimics the triangular form of the frontal as a whole. The olfactory bulb fossa and 
tract are long and large compared to the much shorter olfactory region in dromaeosaurids and 
ornithomimids, but compare readily to troodontids (Currie 1987b; Evans et al. 2014; Longrich 
2008a; Russell 1969; Sues 1978). The lacrimal contact extends onto the ventral surface of the 
frontal, where it is expressed as a tall, transversely oriented buttress at the anterior end of the 
crista cranii, as is characteristic of troodontids (Evans et al. 2014). Lateral to the olfactory tracts, 
the crista cranii is complete and takes the form of a low, broad ridge, as in other specimens of 
Troodon inequalis, but unlike the tall flange present in dromaeosaurids (Evans et al. 2014). The 
cerebral fossa occupies the posteromedial region of the ventral surface of the frontal and is 
bound by the parietal suture posteriorly, the interfrontal suture medially, and the ventrally broken 
crista cranii laterally. The crista cranii is complete anteriorly, but is broken ventraposteriorly. 
The orbital fossa is much larger than the impression of the cerebral depression, occupying the 
majority of the lateral portion of the ventral surface.  
Referred specimen. TMP 1996.005.0008 (Figure 3) is a partial right frontal comprised of 
two associated fragments. The smaller fragment includes the olfactory bulb fossa ventrally, and 
parts of the contact surfaces for the nasal and lacrimal dorsally. The second, larger fragment is 
derived from the posterior end of the bone, and preserves the cerebral fossa, parietal contact, 
orbital rim, and a large portion of the crista cranii that is complete ventrally. Despite its 
fragmentary nature, this specimen can be attributed to Troodontidae based on the transverse 
orientation of the weakly developed supratemporal ridge demarcating the anterior extent of the 
supratemporal fossa on the frontal, the interfrontal suture interdigitation morphology that 
    
16   
corresponds to that in troodontids, and the anteroposteriorly elongate olfactory bulbs; all features 
that are not present in dromaeosaurid or ornithomimid frontals (Evans et al. 2014). 
TMP 1996.005.0008 is approximately two-thirds the size of the larger TMP 
1993.105.0001 (in terms of interorbital width). The dorsal surface of the posterior region of the 
frontal is relatively flat, but a shallow parasagittal groove and upturned orbital margin are 
apparent in the broken cross section on the anterior end of the large fragment, although these are 
weakly developed compared to TMP 1993.105.0001. Anteriorly, the nasal and lacrimal contact 
surfaces are thin and are weakly interdigitated along their posterior periphery. Posteriorly, a 
weakly developed supratemporal ridge extends transversely across the posterior end of the bone, 
anterordorsal to the largely complete parietal contact. Interestingly, an enlarged lappet of the 
frontal extends medially to extensively overlap the lateral region of the interfrontal (anterior) 
process of the parietal, as in TMP 1993.105.0001 but unlike specimens from the Dinosaur Park 
Formation. On the ventral surface, the contact between the roof of the cerebral impression and 
the wall of bone containing the laterosphenoid forms a marginally wider angle than in other 
troodontid specimens, and appears to lack a robust, interdigitating lacrimal buttress on the 
anterior end of the crista cranii, although it is possible this region is not quite preserved.  
 
Morphometric Results. 
Frontal. In geometric morphometric (GM) PC morphospace, TMP 1993.105.0001 falls 
outside of the range of variation seen in the Dinosaur Park Formation (DPF) Troodon frontals 
along PC1 (Figure 5A), while falling within or near the range of variation in DPF Troodon 
frontals along PC2, PC3, and PC4 (Figure 5A, B). The Kaiparowits Formation troodontid frontal 
    
17   
is similarly separated from DPF frontals along PC1, though it also separates from both TMP 
1993.105.0001 and DPF frontals along PC2 (Figure 5A). In order to further assess the 
quantitative differences in morphology between TMP 1993.105.0001 and DPF Troodon frontals, 
and the effect of size or ontogenetic stage on the morphometric results, comparisons were made 
between a series of frontal linear measurements (Supplementary Figure 1). The suite of linear 
measurements (Appendix 1) necessary for these comparisons was present on nine of the 
examined frontals (TMP 1993.105.0001, seven DPF frontals, and the Kaiparowits Formation 
frontal UNMH.VP.16303) (Table 1, Appendix 3). A negative relationship was found to exist 
between GM PC1 and brain length in most frontals (particularly those from the Dinosaur Park 
Formation), though TMP 1993.105.0001 and UNMH.VP.16303 plotted more negatively than 
was seen in the overall trend (Figure 5C). Linear morphometric (LM) PCA also separated TMP 
1993.105.0001 from DPF frontals, in this case along LM PC2 (which was primarily controlled 
by relative frontal length) (Figure 5D, Appendix 4). The Kaiparowits Formation frontal, 
UNMH.VP.16303, also plots separate from the DPF frontals, though opposite to that of TMP 
1993.105.0001. In comparisons of brain length to frontal length (parietal contact to nasal 
contact), TMP 1993.105.0001 plots distantly from the trend seen in DPF troodontid frontals due 
to the relative shortness of the frontal to brain length (Figure 5E). When frontal width was 
compared (frontal width at medial extent of postorbital vs. frontal width at lacrimal contact), all 
frontals followed a very similar pattern.  
Dentition. Results from the tooth morphometric analyses suggests that there is a 
distinction between the samples of isolated teeth recovered from the Horseshoe Canyon 
Formation and those found in the Dinosaur Park Formation (Figure. 6). In the dataset with mesial 
denticles (Figure 6J), only the first PC axis was significant. In the dataset without mesial 
    
18   
denticles (Figure 6K), the first two PC axes were significant, but only the second appears to 
separate specimens by formation. In both datasets, this distinction between formations is driven 
by relative denticle size (Appendix 4) with larger denticles being present in specimens from the 
Horseshoe Canyon Formation. In both the dataset with mesial denticles (Fig. 6; p=8.771e-06) 
and without mesial denticles (Fig. 6; p= 0.0002942), the Dinosaur Park and Horseshoe Canyon 
teeth were found to be significantly different on the first and second axes respectively. However, 
it is important to note that there is also considerable overlap in both datasets. While specimens 
from each formation do occupy distinct areas of morphospace along PC2 of the dataset of teeth 
without mesial denticles (Figure. 6K), the majority of specimens, including the projected in situ 
teeth from both dentaries, occupy a zone of overlap. In the dataset of teeth with mesial denticles 
(Figure. 6J), substantial overlap occurs along PC1 such that all specimens from Dinosaur Park 
are within the range of variation of specimens from the Horseshoe Canyon Formation (including 
the projected in situ Horseshoe Canyon specimens); however, many of the Horseshoe Canyon 
specimens remain outside of the range of those from the Dinosaur Park. The range of Judith 
River teeth along PC1 of the dataset with mesial denticles is largely coincident with that seen for 
the Dinosaur Park specimens. 
 
Discussion 
With the exception of isolated teeth derived primarily from vertebrate microfossil sites 
(Larson et al. 2010; Larson et al. 2016; Larson and Currie 2013; Ryan et al. 1998; Torices et al. 
2014), troodontid material is extremely rare in the Horseshoe Canyon Formation, despite over a 
century of intensive field collecting. TMP 1993.105.0001 has several distinctive features 
    
19   
commonly attributed to troodontids, including a longitudinal groove on the dorsal surface that is 
defined laterally by a raised orbital rim, a deep, transversely oriented lacrimal buttress of the 
crista cranii, and a distinct oval olfactory bulb impression offset from enlarged cerebral 
hemispheres by long olfactory tracts (Currie 1987b; Evans et al. 2014). Although TMP 
1996.005.0008 is fragmentary, it also displays features that indicate it is from a troodontid, 
including the elongate oval olfactory bulb fossa, and the transversely oriented supratemporal 
ridge. Both specimens also fall well within the size range prescribed by troodontid frontals found 
in the Dinosaur Park Formation, with TMP 1993.105.0001 being approximately the same size as 
the largest specimens from the Dinosaur Park Formation. 
To date, only three troodontid cranial bones have been recovered from the Horseshoe 
Canyon Formation: a dentary (Currie 1987a) and the two incomplete frontals described here 
(Eberth et al. 2013). Currie (1987a) described the dentary (TMP 1983.012.0011) and tentatively 
referred it to Troodon formosus. Reassessment of the dentary morphology of TMP 
1983.012.0011 supports the conclusions of Currie (1987a), and revealed no significant 
differences between it and the specimens recovered from the Dinosaur Park Formation that 
would preclude identification to the same species. Eberth et al. (2013), following the assignment 
of the dentary to T. formosus by Currie (1987a), referred the frontals to this taxon.  
More detailed comparisons provided here reveal that the foreshortened frontal (TMP 
1993.105.0001) from the Horseshoe Canyon Formation is differentiable from the more elongate 
morphology of other known troodontids. It can be readily distinguished from the large sample of 
frontals known from the Dinosaur Park Formation that have been referred to T. formosus or T. 
inequalis, and can thus be recognized as a new taxon, Albertavenator curriei. The holotype 
frontal of A. curriei has a ratio of the frontal length (measured from the midline parietal contact 
    
20   
to the posterior end of the nasal contact) to its width (measured from the midline to the medial 
extent of the postorbital contact) of under 1.25. In Troodon frontals from Dinosaur Provincial 
Park, the frontals are more elongate, with ratios that range from 1.4 to 1.6 in Troodon. 
Albertavenator curriei can also be distinguished from a troodontid frontal from the Kaiparowits 
Formation (Zanno et al. 2013), which has a length to width ratio of approximately 1.7. 
Allometric analysis of these variables in Campanian troodontids from North America indicates 
that these proportional differences between Albertavenator curriei and other troodontids are 
independent of size, and we therefore interpret this difference to have phylogenetic and 
taxonomic significance. In geometric morphometric analyses (Figure 5A&B), Albertavenator 
curriei plots separately from DPF troodontids on PC1, and from the Kaiparowits troodontid 
frontal on PC2. Eigenvectors indicate that PC1 is related to a combination of the proportional 
length and width of the frontal, with proportionally shorter frontals, such as TMP 1993.105.0001, 
having more negative PC values (Appendix 4), and PC2 is primarily related to the relative 
position of the posterior of the frontal to that of the anterior of the frontal. It is on this latter PC 
axis that the taxon represented by the Kaiparowits Formation frontal most distinctly separates 
from the penecontemporaneous frontals in the Dinosaur Provincial Formation and the frontal of 
Albertavenator curriei. Changes in relative frontal shape noted on GM PC1 were found to have a 
generally ontogenetic component when plotted against brain length, with larger and presumably 
older specimens being proportionally wider and longer than smaller frontals (Figure 5C). Despite 
this pattern, TMP 1993.105.0001 and UNMH.VP.16303 plotted away from the DPF frontals 
with comparable brain lengths, indicating that the differences seen in TMP 1993.105.0001 are 
not the purely the result of ontogenetic effects. The differences in relative frontal length between 
A. curriei and DPF troodontids is further demonstrated by the comparisons of frontal and brain 
    
21   
length (Figure 5E), in which TMP 1993.105.0001 has considerably shorter frontal length when 
compared to DPF frontals of similar brain length. 
While TMP 1993.105.0001 superficially appears wider and more robust than other DPF 
frontals, the width of the posterior region and the thickness of the frontal are closely comparable 
to large troodontid frontals from the Dinosaur Park Formation (e.g., TMP 1986.049.0010, TMP 
1993.036.0086), indicating it is in fact relatively shorter (Figure 5, Table 1). The intersection of 
the posterior end of the lacrimal contact with the primary supraciliary foramen is a discrete 
character that is related to the proportionally shorter frontal in A. curriei than in other 
troodontinds. Albertavenator curriei can be further differentiated from other taxa by a unique 
frontoparietal contact. Both known troodontid frontals from the Horseshoe Canyon Formation 
exhibit relatively large medially directed lappets that form an extensive lap joint with the anterior 
(interfrontal) process of the parietal, compared to the more weakly developed vertical striations 
that are present in this region in the sample from the Dinosaur Park Formation. We hypothesize 
that the differences between TMP 1993.105.0001 and 1996.005.0008, including the relatively 
weakly developed supratemporal ridge and the absence of a robust, interdigitating lacrimal 
butruess on the anterior end of the crista cranii, represent growth-related ontogenetic variation 
within the same taxon related to increased size and robusticity with age. 
Comparisons with Asian troodontids also support the distinction of the Horseshoe 
Canyon troodontid as a new taxon. The frontal tends to be relatively more elongate in Asian 
troodontids than in TMP 1993.105.0001 and Troodon inequalis. The above-mentioned ratio is 
1.56 in Gobivenator (Tsuihiji et al. 2014), and 1.75 in Zanabazar junior (Norell et al. 2009), and 
the length of the frontal is reported to be approximately twice that of its width in Linhevenator 
(Xu et al. 2011). The frontal of Mei long from the Yixian Formation of northeastern China has 
    
22   
been noted to be unusually broad posteriorly, and appears relatively short, but they are distinct 
from A. curriei in their convex, inflated morphology (Gao et al. 2012). Albertavenator curriei 
cannot be compared to Byronosaurus (Bever and Norell 2009; Makovicky et al. 2003), 
Philovenator curriei (Xu et al. 2012), Sinornithoides mongoliensis (Norell et al. 2009), 
Sinovenator changii (Xu et al. 2002), Xixiasaurus (Lü et al. 2010), or Urbacodon (Averianov 
and Sues 2007) due to lack of sufficiently preserved and illustrated comparable adult material. 
The identification of a new species of troodontid in the Campanian-Maastrichtian of 
northern Laramidia is not unexpected, and corroborates predictions that troodontid diversity in 
the latest Cretaceous of North America is underestimated due to over-synonymization of 
fragmentary material (Zanno et al. 2011). Several researchers (Fiorillo 2008; Fiorillo et al. 2009; 
Larson and Currie 2013; Zanno et al. 2011) have noted the unusually wide geographic and 
stratigraphic distribution of small coelurosaurian theropod species in the Western Interior Basin, 
and that these ranges are largely defined by the assignment of isolated teeth to form taxa. In other 
groups, such as large ornithischians, differentiation of species relies on non-dentigerous skeletal 
elements, and these taxa have small geographic and stratigraphic ranges, and presumably 
exhibited high evolutionary rates and ecological specialization (Eberth et al. 2013; Gates et al. 
2012; Mallon et al. 2012; Ryan and Evans 2005; Sampson and Loewen 2010). Zanno et al. 
(2011) recognized variation in the limited skeletal materials previously referred to Troodon, and 
hypothesized that the diversity of Late Cretaceous troodontids in North America is 
underestimated, a conclusion that was supported by a morphometric analysis of small theropod 
teeth by Larson and Currie (2013). This study confirms these predictions, and suggests that more 
detailed studies of collections from the Campanian of northern Laramidia may reveal additional, 
currently unrecognized, taxa. 
    
23   
Interestingly, tooth and jaw morphology from the single relatively complete dentary 
recovered from the Horseshoe Canyon Formation cannot be distinguished from dentaries from 
the Dinosaur Park Formation (Currie 1987a). Currie (1987a) found no significant morphological 
differences between TMP 1983.012.0011 and those dentaries recovered from the Dinosaur Park 
Formation. Larson and Currie (2013) showed that isolated troodontid teeth from the Horseshoe 
Canyon formation quantifiably differed from those in the both the Dinosaur Park and Judith 
River formations, suggesting that the two units potentially contain distinct taxa, but this 
differentiation was on a size-correlated PC1 axis. The size-corrected morphometric results 
presented here do agree with those of Larson and Currie (2013), confirming that troodontid teeth 
from the Horseshoe Canyon Formation can, on average, be quantitatively distinct from those 
recovered from the Dinosaur Park and the Judith River formations, where the holotype tooth of 
Troodon formosus was recovered. However, identification of a distinct taxon of troodontid from 
the Horseshoe Canyon Formation is weakly supported by our morphometric analysis of isolated 
troodontid teeth from the Late Cretaceous of North America.  
In the morphometric analysis of the dentition, almost all of the specimens from the Judith 
River Formation fall within the range of variation of those from the Dinosaur Park Formation, 
suggesting that species from these two formations cannot be distinguished on the basis of teeth 
(consistent with the results in Larson and Currie, 2013). Notably, the Judith River Formation 
specimen with the lowest score on PC1 (indicating largest relative denticles) is the holotype 
specimen of Troodon formosus (ANSP 9259), a presumed premaxillary tooth (Currie et al. 1990) 
with large mesial denticles that is considered an outlier in this analysis relative to the other nine 
analyzed Judith River teeth. This specimen has a similar PC1 score to three teeth that also have 
large mesial denticles from the Dinosaur Park Formation (Fig. 6). Given that North American 
    
24   
troodontid mesial teeth (premaxillary, mesial maxillary, and mesial dentary teeth) are known to 
possess greatly enlarged mesial denticles (Currie 1987a; Longrich 2008b), it is probable that 
these specimens represent teeth in a more mesial postion in comparison with other teeth in this 
dataset. A similar pattern may be present in the Horseshoe Canyon sample, as a few noted 
specimens likely pertaining to the premaxilla are also similarly found on the extreme negative 
end of PC1 (Fig. 6). Therefore, we predict that it is likely much of the apparent morphological 
overlap between teeth from the different formations will be reduced when positional variation 
can be more precisely defined. 
When the full range of variation is considered, there is extensive overlap in the linear 
morphometrics of teeth from the Dinosaur Park and Horseshoe Canyon formations (Fig 6). If the 
dentary and teeth from the Horseshoe Canyon Formation prove to belong to a single troodontid 
species, A. curriei, overlap in tooth morphology between the Judith River, Dinosaur Park, and 
Horseshoe Canyon formations reinforce the notion that tooth morphotypes may exhibit stronger 
correspondence to variation along the tooth row than to species alpha diversity, and may 
encompass multiple closely-related taxa, as predicted by Zanno (2011), Fiorillio et al (2008), and 
Larson and Currie (2013). The presence of distinctive cranial morphotypes associated with 
broadly similar tooth assemblages argues that isolated troodontid teeth from the Campanian-
Maastrichtian may not be diagnostic to the species level, and that T. formosus may be a nomen 
dubium. If this is true, then it necessitates a taxonomic revision of the large collection of 
troodontid material collected from the Dinosaur Park Formation, where it may be prudent to 
apply the name Stenonychosaurus inequalis, based on the holotype foot (CMN 8537) and 
referable skeleton (CMN 12340) described by Russell (1969). It also remains possible that more 
than one taxon is present in any given formational sample, as it is not unusual for Cretaceous 
    
25   
Asian dinosaur faunas to have multiple contemporaneous genera of troodontids (Fiorillo 2008; 
Fiorillo et al. 2009). It is therefore notable that the tooth sample from the Horseshoe Canyon 
Formation exhibits higher disparity than that of samples from the Judith River and Dinosaur Park 
formations. Due to these considerations, the diversity of Campanian-Maastrichtian troodontids 
from western North America will remain in flux until more complete skeletal material is found.
