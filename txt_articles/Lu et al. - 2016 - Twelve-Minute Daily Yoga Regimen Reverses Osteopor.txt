Objective: Assess the effectiveness of selected yoga postures 
in raising bone mineral density (BMD).
Methods: Ten-year study of 741 Internet-recruited volun-
teers comparing preyoga BMD changes with postyoga BMD 
changes.
Outcome Measures: Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometric 
scans. Optional radiographs of hips and spine and bone 
quality study (7 Tesla).
Results: Bone mineral density improved in spine, hips, and 
femur of the 227 moderately and fully compliant patients. 
Monthly gain in BMD was significant in spine (0.0029 g/cm2, 
P = .005) and femur (0.00022 g/cm2, P = .053), but in 1 
cohort, although mean gain in hip BMD was 50%, large 
individual differences raised the confidence interval and the 
gain was not significant for total hip (0.000357 g/cm2). No 
yoga-related serious injuries were imaged or reported. Bone 
quality appeared qualitatively improved in yoga practitioners.
Conclusion: Yoga appears to raise BMD in the spine and the 
femur safely.
Key words: osteoporosis, yoga

O
steoporosis and osteopenia affect up to 200 000 000 
people worldwide today, with numbers likely to 
grow with our aging population. Many people are 
without access to medications or professional help after 
the fractures that are more likely without them. A low-cost, 
low-risk alternative is desirable.
Annual spinal fractures in the United States exceed 
700 000, with more than 300 000 hip fractures. After hip 
fracture, 25% of Americans will succumb, and another 25% 
will never leave the nursing institution to which they are 
admitted following hospitalization.1-4 The United States 
currently spends an estimated $19 billion on the more 
than 2 million annual fragility fractures and the 500 000 
hospitalizations these entail.1-2
Some have termed hip fracture a “sentinel event,” indi-
cating a general and irreversible decline in many aspects 
of health, but since the medications themselves are associ-
ated with spontaneous fracture, atrial fibrillation, slowed 
healing, gastric distress, osteonecrosis, and, in the newer 
intravenous forms, scleritis and episcleritis, some of this 
general decline actually may be due to pharmaceutical 
treatment rather than the patient herself or himself.5-7
Yoga classes are a dramatically low-cost and less danger-
ous alternative to medications and the elaborate health 
care their absence is alleged to engender. The “side 
effects” of yoga include better posture, improved bal-
ance, enhanced coordination, greater range of motion, 
higher strength, reduced levels of anxiety, and better gait.8-
17 Improved posture directly addresses spinal fractures, 
while all of these documented benefits of yoga reduce the 
risk of falling, which is the main cause of all other osteopo-
rotic fractures.8-17 The current study examines the proposi-
tion that yoga is a safe and effective means of preventing 
osteoporosis-related fracture.
Contemporary medicine accounts for bone loss or gain 
by genetics, nutrition, hormones, medications, and activ-
ity. The main preventive measures are based on nutrition, 
such as vitamin D and calcium supplementation;18-20 medi-
cations, such as bisphosphonates and serum estrogen 
receptor manipulation; and activities such as gym work-
outs, running, and sports.20
We held other variables as constant as possible to 
isolate the effect of one activity: yoga, to determine the 
response of 3 common sites of fracture—the spine, hip, 
and femur, associated with daily use of a DVD of 12 com-
mon yoga poses. We selected the poses specifically for 
their safety and their calculated effects on those 3 sites, 
among the most commonly fractured. Qualitative bone 
quality measurements were performed on the left hips 
of 18 subjects.
By pitting one group of muscles against another, yoga 
exposes bones to greater forces and, therefore, might 
enhance bone mineral density (BMD) more than other 
means. The advantages of such a program include univer-
sal applicability, virtual absence of side effects, and minimal 
cost.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Encouraged by a successful pilot study, 21 and approved by 
Sound Shore Medical Center Institutional Review Board, 
currently part of Montefiore Medical Center, we devised a 
12-minute DVD of 12 yoga poses that we believed would 
stimulate increasing BMD in the lumbar vertebrae, the hip, 
and the femoral neck (see Figure 1). We then announced 
through the Web site “sciatica.org” and at talks and work-
shops that we would give the DVD without cost to yoga 
practitioners and nonpractitioners that satisfied the criteria 
for study entry.
Using the Internet, we collected baseline data, urine, 
blood chemistries, BMD, and spinal and hip radiographs 
of volunteers worldwide who intended to perform the 
12-minute yoga regimen daily and distributed to them 
a disk of 12 poses that we had studied in a pilot study21 
accompanied by simultaneous verbal descriptions with 
each pose (see Figure 1 and 2). We began our pilot study 
in June 2005, employing an online scoresheet for subjects 
to report their levels of compliance. Subjects received 
a periodic newsletter and were encouraged to commu-
nicate with each other via a bulletin board. Instructional

webinars were held in 2006, 2008, 2011, and 2013, with sem-
inars in 2007 and 2012 in Westchester County and Lenox, 
Massachusetts, stressing the proper way to do the poses. 
Changes in BMD over 1 or more years leading up to study 
inclusion were compared with change in BMD 1 or more 
years following study entry. Bone quality measurements 
were taken on 18 patients with long-term yoga practices.
Inclusion criteria:
1. Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometric (DXA) scan within 
the 6 months preceding study entry.
2. If the current DXA scan was normal, no laboratory tests 
were required. If the DXA scan contained osteopenic 
or osteoporotic values on the T-scale for spine, hip, or 
femur, then normal values on the following tests were 
necessary within 6 months of joining the study:
• Comprehensive Metabolic Panel (SMA-18)
• Parathyroid hormone
• Thyroid stimulating hormone
• Erythrocyte sedimentation rate
• Vitamin D, 25 hydroxy
• Vitamin D, 1, 25 dihydroxy
• Urine collagen cross-linkage (NTX).
3. Completion of a questionnaire including information, 
such as medical and surgical history, medication usage, 
and diet, that can be seen on the Web site “sciatica.org.”
4. Agreement to continue the current medication, nutri-
tional and exercise regimen for the following 2 years, 
and to repeat the DXA scan within or just after that 
time period. Study subjects were encouraged but 
not required to submit spinal and hip radiographs 
obtained within the same time frame, submit previ-
ous DXA scans, and further encouraged to enter one 
of the authors’ (GC) bone quality study.
Exclusionary criteria:
1. Abnormal values on the above tests.
2. Metabolic or bone diseases such as osteogenesis 
imperfecta, or Paget disease.
Individuals with abnormal blood tests, for example, 
with thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), were referred to 
appropriate specialists, an endocrinologist in the case of 
elevated TSH. Once the value of the test was normal, they 
naturally became eligible for the study (see Figure 1).
The DVD consisted of 3 versions of each pose, the clas-
sical pose, an elementary pose that contained most ele-
ments of the classical pose but stressed safety and simplic-
ity, and an intermediate or transitional version. Entry-level 
poses often used a wall for stabilization and a prop such as 
a bolster, belt, or chair to reduce the challenges and risks of 
the posture. All entrants were asked to begin by practicing 
the elementary poses for 1 week and to progress thereaf-
ter as far as they safely could from each elementary pose 
to the intermediate version of the pose and thereafter to 
the classical pose. Entrants were asked to perform each 
pose displayed and described in the DVD for 30 seconds 
daily and to log their yoga activities on a Health Insurance 
Portability and Accountability Act–compliant electronic 
scorecard available on the Internet. Subjects without yoga 
experience were encouraged to have at least 1 private les-
son from a yoga teacher or yoga therapist, preferably one 
knowledgeable in the Iyengar type of yoga.

April–June 2016
The primary measure was mean BMD change dur-
ing the years before the study began versus mean BMD 
change following 2 years of daily yoga. Spine, right or left 
hip, and right or left femur (g/cm2) constituted the metrics 
of choice. Because the timing of the DXA scans varied from 
patient to patient, all comparisons were in BMD changes 
per month. Secondary measures were based on compli-
ance and self-reported and radiological measures of injury. 
Bone quality measures were qualitative. All DXA studies 
and bone quality studies were blinded in the sense that no 
radiologist was aware of the status of study subjects.
RESULTS
A total of 741 patients joined the study between 2005 and 
2015, of whom 227 were identified as compliant with more 
than every-other-day yoga. Women comprised 202 of these 
patients. Mean age at joining the study was 68.2 years. 
Entry DXA scans showed that 174 (83%) of the compliant 
patients had osteoporosis or osteopenia.
Dropout rate was lower than that in a previous pilot 
study,21 in which recruitment was not Internet-based. Many 
people failed to submit DXA scans from years prior to 
study entry. Others did not submit subsequent DXA scans; 
still others offered inadequate information about their in-
study yoga practice. Because of the variable information 
that patients submitted subsequent to their enrollment in 
the study, data analysis was done in 3 tiers, as a function of 
the adequacy and relative certainty of the data supplied.
In approximately 4 years preceding study entry, 128, 
130, and 125 patients presented prestudy DXA scans that 
revealed a mean monthly decline in BMD of -0.0036 g/cm2 
for the spine, -0.00008 g/cm2 for the hips, and -0.009 for 
the femora, over a mean 47, 52, and 48 months, respec-
tively; standard deviations/95% confidence intervals = 
0.125/0.118, 0.117/0.183, and 0.317/0.192, for spine, hips, 
and femora, respectively. After practicing the yoga of the DVD 
over 22, 22, and 24 months, respectively, 72, 81, and 83 of 
 
these subjects reported mean gains of 0.048, 0.088, 
and 0.0003 g/cm2 per month, for spine, hips, and femora; 
 
standard deviations/95% confidence intervals = 0.551/0.44, 
0.103/0.159, and 0.129/0.133, respectively (see T
able 1 and 
Figures 3-5).
Compliant patients were classified as having done more 
than half the poses at the highest level (high level, grade 3), 
more than half at the lowest level (low level, grade 1), or

neither (moderate level, grade 2). We identified 57 patients 
of moderate to full compliance (grades 2 or 3).
For lumbar spine L1-L4, 29 participants showed average 
-0.00080 ± 0.00025 g/cm2 change per month over a mean 
35 ± 7 months before yoga practice and showed signifi-
cant improvement with 0.0010 ± 0.00043 g/cm2 change 
per month over a mean 21 ± 1 month after yoga practice 
 
(P = .002). For total hip, 25 (16 from left hip, 5 from right 
hip, 2 bilateral) measurements showed mean 0.000082 
± 0.00038 g/cm2 change per month over a mean 38 ± 
8 months before and mean 0.00012 ± 0.00031 g/cm2 
change per month over 23 ± 2 months after yoga prac-
tice, which was nearly a 50% improvement but not signifi-
cant. For femoral neck, 18 measurements were analyzed 
(13 from left side, 3 from right side, and both right and left 
of 1 participant). Bone mineral density fell a mean -0.00090 
± 0.00027 g/cm2 change per month over average 46 ± 12 
months before yoga and showed significant improvement 
with mean 0.00030 ± 0.00048 g/cm2 change per month over 
average 24 ± 2 months after yoga (P = .05) (see T
able 2).
Selecting only those individuals with complete pre-and 
poststudy entry data (who sent in the actual DXA reports 
rather than just sending us the numerical results) and mod-
erate to full compliance, we found that 43 patients—spine 
(n = 27), hip (n = 16), and femur (n = 14), within a span 
of 11 to 59, 23 to 59, and 11 to 59 months, respectively—
showed monthly BMD gains of 0.001 (±0.0007), 0.0003 
(±0.0007), and 0.0009 (±0.0003), g/cm2, respectively. The 
P values for these changes are .02, .01, and .0002, respec-
tively (see Table 3 and Figure 6).
In all, 109 fractures were reported on prestudy radio-
graphs and in the induction forms, and 19 in subjects 
postentry. As of this writing, with more than 90 000 hours 
of yoga practiced largely by people with osteoporosis or 
osteopenia, there have been no reported or X-ray detected 
fractures or serious injuries of any kind related to the prac-
tice of yoga in any of the 741 participants. Bone quality of 
the 18 patients completing the study was judged as supe-
rior to those without yoga experience.
CONCLUSION
The 12 yoga poses studied here appear to be a safe and 
effective means to reverse bone loss in the spine and the 
femur and have weaker indications of positive effects on 
the total hip measurement of the DXA scan. There is quali-
tative evidence suggesting improved bone quality as a 
result of the practice of yoga.
DISCUSSION
Globally, there are 200 000 000 people with osteopenia or 
osteoporosis.1-2,4 A safe, effective, and stunningly low-cost 
means of reversing this condition would be welcome for 
the many people who have neither the means to acquire 
the recommended medications nor access to the treat-
ment of the fractures that may occur without them.
Mean rate of improvement in total hip BMD increased 
from baseline by 50% after a mean 23 ± 2 months of yoga, 
but wide variation in individual improvement caused the 
confidence intervals to overlap, thus precluding statistical 
significance. The root cause of this increased variation is

possibly due to the wide differences in yoga skills within 
the study population that was more important in the more 
difficult twisting, extension, and standing poses in which 
the hips bear the most pressure. There are also several dif-
ferent formulae used for calculating total hip BMD which 
might add to the variability in this number.
Some studies suggest that BMD is not as closely 
associated with fracture as falling itself.8 By improving 
 
posture, balance, range of motion, strength, and coordi-
nation, decreasing anxiety and improving gait,8-17,19-21 yoga 
opposes falls in ways no medicine can provide. Although 
some medications do reduce anxiety, they also impair 
 
balance.
However, this study suffers from many drawbacks.
Recruitment
People signing up for the study were largely those with 
already weakened or weakening bones and, very often, 
people already doing some yoga. Therefore, the study may 
have selected the very people for whom yoga does not give 
maximum benefit. The bone-building effects of yoga in 
younger and in healthier people, without the genetic pre-
disposition that is possibly overrepresented in our sample, 
might well be greater and at any rate are unknown.
Study focus
Yoga poses were selected specifically to produce torque 
and bending of the proximal femur, compression of the 
 
pelvis, and twisting of the lumbar vertebral bodies. The 
choice was determined because these are the most com-
mon sites of osteoporotic fractures and the anatomical 
regions measured by the DXA scan. However, osteoporo-
tic fractures frequently occur in the thoracic spine, the 
forearm, and the ribs. These sites were not studied and 
might not respond to yoga directed toward them in the 
same way.
Data
Some subjects used the electronic scorecard incorrectly 
and/or inadequately, limiting the data on actual compli-
ance. This vitiated the calculation of dose-response curves 
enough to preclude their utility in this study.

Bone quality
The qualitative measure of bone quality can be supple-
mented and improved with finite element analysis, which 
is yet to be performed on this sample.
Study design
This was perforce a crossover study since none of the 
subjects were doing yoga for osteoporosis before joining 
the study. However, many were doing yoga for other 
 
reasons, reducing the calculated effect of the 12 poses 
studied here.
SUMMARY
The current study supports the efficacy and safety of yoga 
as a treatment of osteopenia and osteoporosis. However, 
its use in prevention, on a wider selection of possible frac-
ture sites, with more precise data for dose-response rela-
tionships, improved bone quality measures and with stand-
ard randomized, controlled, double-blinded inquiries, 
requires further investigation. Many of these goals could be 
accomplished with a younger osteopenia-free population. 
What is suggested by this study’s results is that yoga can 
reverse bone loss that has reached the stages of osteopenia 
and osteoporosis.
