Summary
Background In 2000, a 10-year Teenage Pregnancy Strategy was launched in England to reduce conceptions in women 
younger than 18 years and social exclusion in young parents. We used routinely collected data and data from Britain’s 
National Surveys of Sexual Attitudes and Lifestyles (Natsal) to examine progress towards these goals.
Methods In this observational study, we used random-eff
 ects meta-regression to analyse the change in conception 
rates from 1994–98 to 2009–13 by top-tier local authorities in England, in relation to Teenage Pregnancy Strategy-related 
expenditure per head, socioeconomic deprivation, and region. Data from similar probability sample surveys: Natsal-1 
(1990–91), Natsal-2 (1999–2001), and Natsal-3 (2010–12) were used to assess the prevalence of risk factors and their 
association with conception in women younger than 18 years in women aged 18–24 years; and the prevalence of 
participation in education, work, and training in young mothers.
Findings Conception rates in women younger than 18 years declined steadily from their peak in 1996–98 and more 
rapidly from 2007 onwards. More deprived areas and those receiving greater Teenage Pregnancy Strategy-related 
investment had higher rates of conception in 1994–98 and had greater declines to 2009–13. Regression analyses 
assessing the association between Teenage Pregnancy Strategy funding and decline in conception rates in women 
younger than 18 years showed an estimated reduction in the conception rate of 11·4 conceptions (95% CI 9·6–13·2; 
p<0·0001) per 1000 women aged 15–17 years for every £100 Teenage Pregnancy Strategy spend per head and a 
reduction of 8·2 conceptions (5·8–10·5; p<0·0001) after adjustment for socioeconomic deprivation and region. The 
association between conception in women younger than 18 years and lower socioeconomic status weakened slightly 
between Natsal-2 and Natsal-3. The prevalence of participation in education, work, or training among young women 
with a child conceived before age 18 years was low, but the odds of them doing so doubled between Natsal-2 and 
Natsal-3 (odds ratio 1·99, 95% CI 0·99–4·00).
Interpretation A sustained, multifaceted policy intervention involving health and education agencies, alongside other 
social and educational changes, has probably contributed to a substantial and accelerating decline in conceptions in 
women younger than 18 years in England since the late 1990s.

Introduction
At the end of the 20th century, concern for high rates of 
teenage conception in the UK compared with other 
western European countries, together with the strong 
association between early parenthood and deprivation, 
provided the impetus to public health eff
 orts to prevent 
teenage pregnancy. In 1999, the UK Government 
launched a 10-year, nationwide Teenage Pregnancy 
Strategy1 in England with the dual aims of achieving a 
50% reduction in conception rates in women younger 
than 18 years by 2010, and mitigating social exclusion in 
teenage parents by increasing their participation in 
education, employment, or training.2 A strong rationale 
for the strategy was the desire to halt the cycle of 
deprivation resulting from the increment of disadvantage 
conferred by early pregnancy additional to that 
experienced before conception.3–6
The teenage pregnancy strategy gave rise to a 
multicomponent programme comprising a national 
media campaign; improvements to sex education and 
young people’s sexual health services; support for young 
parents to increase participation in education, training, 
and employment; and joint action to ensure national 
and local coordination across statutory and voluntary 
agencies.7 Financial resources were allocated according 
to teenage pregnancy rates in each top-tier local 
authority area. Because of the concentration of high 
rates of teenage pregnancy in poorer areas of the 
country, fi
 nancial resources were disproportionately 
invested in the more deprived areas of England.

Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland decided their 
initiatives independently.
Conception rates in women younger than 18 years fell 
by 51% between 1998 and 2014 in England. Of interest is 
the extent to which the decline seems to be related to the 
Teenage Pregnancy Strategy and other interventions; 
whether the decline has been seen equally in the most 
and least disadvantaged women; and what factors 
remain associated with conception in women younger 
than 18 years. In this study, we combined analyses of 
routinely available area-level data for conceptions, 
deprivation, 
and 
policy-related 
expenditure, 
and 
individual-level data from three decennial waves of the 
National Survey of Sexual Attitudes and Lifestyles 
(Natsal) to describe change in outcomes relating to key 
goals of the English Teenage Pregnancy Strategy—ie, 
conception rates in women younger than 18 years and 
the prevalence of participation in education, work, and 
training in women with a child conceived before the age 
of 18 years.
Methods
Study design and participants
In this observational study, we analysed routine data for 
births and abortions for top-tier local authorities (top-tier 
local authorities consist of London boroughs, metro-
politan borough councils, and unitary authorities, and 
are a level of local government with responsibilities 
including education and social services) in England from 
1994 to 2013 and individual-level data from three waves of 
the National Survey of Sexual Attitudes and Lifestyles 
(wave 1: 1990–91 [Natsal-1], wave 2: 1999–2001 [Natsal-2], 
and wave 3: 2010–12 [Natsal-3]). We obtained data by 
calendar year for the resident population and births and 
abortions by age of mother from the Offi
  ce for National 
Statistics for each of the top-tier local authorities in 
England. Because of their small resident populations, 
two authorities (City of London and the Scilly Isles) were 
combined with more populous neighbouring authorities 
(Hackney and Cornwall, respectively), resulting in a total 
of 148 local authorities for analysis.
We also obtained data from the Department for 
Communities and Local Government at the top-tier local 
authority level for the 2004 Index of Multiple Deprivation, 
a score of socioeconomic deprivation based on a weighted 
average of 38 separate indicators across seven distinct 
domains (employment, income, health and disability, 
education skills and training, barriers to housing and 
other services, crime, and living environment).8
As an indicator of the extent of Teenage Pregnancy 
Strategy-related local activity, we obtained from the 
Department for Children, Schools and Families the 
Teenage Pregnancy Strategy annual Local Imple-
mentation Grant awarded to each top-tier local authority 
for the fi
 nancial year(s) 1999–2000 and 2010–11, the 
amount refl
 ecting the challenge in terms of conception 
rates in women younger than 18 years and the size of the 
population. From these data we calculated the total 
investment per head by dividing the amount by the 2001 
Offi
  ce of National Statistics estimate of resident women 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
We searched PubMed for studies published between Jan 1, 2000, 
and March 31, 2016, with no language restrictions using the 
search terms “teenage pregnancy”, “teenage conception”, 
“trends”, and “public health policy” to identify studies describing 
trends in teenage pregnancy and policy-related factors associated 
with change, in the UK and elsewhere. We examined the titles and 
abstracts identifi
 ed by the search, excluding those that were not 
relevant, and reviewed the full text of the remaining articles to 
assess appropriateness for inclusion.
Few studies were able to measure direct indicators of intervention-
related action, and none combined general population survey data 
and routinely collected statistics. Most studies were from the USA 
and the UK, settings in which the prevalence of teenage pregnancy 
is high compared with other high-income countries. Existing 
studies have near universally reported strong associations between 
higher rates of teenage pregnancy and lower socioeconomic level. 
They have, however, diff
 ered in their interpretation of whether the 
decline in the prevalence of teenage pregnancy in the 21st century 
can be attributed to broader societal changes, such as increased 
educational attainment, or to public health interventions such as 
increased use of reliable contraception.
Added value of this study
Our study aimed to assess progress towards the goals of the 
Teenage Pregnancy Strategy mounted in England to reduce 
conception  
rates in women younger than 18 years, combining 
analyses of data from a population-based survey and from 
routinely collected national statistics. The scale of the decline in 
conception rates in women younger than 18 years, and its 
association with intervention-related investment and with 
both demographic and behavioural factors, suggest a 
combined infl
 uence of both public health intervention and 
secular trends on the decline in conceptions in women younger 
than 18 years in England.
Implications of all the available evidence
The trend towards postponement of key life events such as 
completion of education, leaving home, starting employment, 
and settling with a partner is now near universal. These factors 
seem to have contributed to a global trend towards fewer early 
pregnancies. Coincidental with this, focused and sustained 
eff
 orts to lower the prevalence of early pregnancy by raising 
awareness, changing social norms, and increasing access to 
education and reliable contraception seem to have accelerated 
the trend towards fewer teenage pregnancies.

aged 13–17 years. We obtained ethics approval for Natsal-2 
from University College Hospital, North Thames 
Multicentre, and all local research ethics committees in 
Britain, and for Natsal-3 from the Oxford Research Ethics 
Committee A.
Procedures
The Natsals are probability sample surveys of British 
residents of whom 18 876 aged 16–59 years were 
interviewed between May, 1990, and November, 1991 
(Natsal-1); 11 161 aged 16–44 years were interviewed 
between May, 1999, and February, 2001 (Natsal-2); and 
15 162 aged 16–74 years between September, 2010, and 
August, 2012 (Natsal-3). Participants resident in London 
were oversampled in Natsal-2, and those aged 16–34 years 
were oversampled in Natsal-3. The unadjusted response 
rate in Natsal-1 was 64·7%, and the cooperation rate (of 
eligible addresses contacted) was 71·5%. The unadjusted 
response rate for Natsal-2 was 63·1% and the adjusted 
rate, taking account of oversampling in London, was 
65·4%. The response rate for Natsal-3 was 57·7% and the 
cooperation rate was 65·8%.
In Natsal-1, paper questionnaires were self-completed 
and interviewer administered. In Natsal-2 and Natsal-3, 
participants were interviewed with a combination of 
computer-assisted personal and computer-assisted self-
interviews. Experimental comparison of pencil and paper 
and 
computer-assisted 
interviewing 
revealed 
no 
important diff
 erences in responses.9 For all three surveys, 
after correcting for unequal selection probabilities, a 
non-response post-stratifi
 cation weight was applied to 
ensure comparability with census data in terms of age, 
sex, and region. Further details of the methods and 
response calculations are described elsewhere.10,11
Natsal-1 and Natsal-2 asked about the number and 
timing of all abortions and livebirths; Natsal-3 asked for 
timing and outcome of each pregnancy. We calculated 
conceptions that occurred before age 18 years among 
18–24-year-old women by summing births that occurred 
before age 18 years 9 months and abortions occurring 
before age 18 years, excluding miscarriages and 
stillbirths, for consistency with Offi
  ce of National 
Statistics procedures. We assessed change in the 
prevalence of participation in any of education, work, or 
training in young mothers.
Variables used in the analyses presented in this paper 
were selected on the basis of pre-existing evidence of 
their association with early conception.3–6 They include 
age at fi
 rst heterosexual intercourse; use of a reliable 
method of contraception at fi
 rst sex; consensuality in 
terms of being equally or more willing than the partner 
at time of fi
 rst sex; autonomy of decision making—ie, 
not infl
 uenced by peer pressure or use of drugs or 
alcohol; and retrospective views on the timing of fi
 rst 
sex—ie, whether it occurred sooner or later than ideal or 
at the right time. We also included the main source of 
information about sexual matters at the start of sexual 
activity, adequacy of that information, and ease of 
communication with parents about sex. Demographic 
measures included age at interview, family structure 
(whether the participant lived with both parents until age 
16 years [Natsal-2] or age 14 years [Natsal-3]), educational 
attainment, and area-level deprivation measured with the 
Index of Multiple Deprivation.12 Full postcode data for 
use in estimating the Index of Multiple Deprivation were 
not available for Natsal-1.
Statistical analysis
Analyses using routinely collected data included tabulation 
and graphical representation of trends in conception rates 
of women younger than 18 years by quartiles of per head 
total Local Implementation Grant investment and 
quartiles of area-level deprivation. Random-eff
 ects meta-
regression analyses of the change in conception rates of 
women younger than 18 years between 1994–98 (the pre-
intervention baseline) and 2009–13 (the most recently 
available Offi
  ce of National Statistics data) were based on 
aggregate top-tier local authority level data. Because of 
variability in how each top-tier local authority spent their 
grant, a random-eff
 ects meta-regression analysis was 
used. Absolute and percentage changes between these 
timepoints were analysed as outcomes separately and data 
from each top-tier local authority were weighted by the 
inverse of the variance of the outcome estimate. The 
explanatory factors considered were per head Teenage 
Pregnancy Strategy investment, region, and deprivation 
(2004 Index of Multiple Deprivation scores). For the two 
continuous covariates (Teenage Pregnancy Strategy 
investment and Index of Multiple Deprivation score), the 
linearity of their association with the outcome variable 
(change in conception rate in women younger than 
18 years) was assessed by also including quadratic terms 
in the regression model.
Analyses using Natsal data included logistic regression 
to examine factors associated with conception in women 
younger than 18 years separately in 1999–2001 and 
2010–12 in women aged 18–24 years, with and without 
adjustment for the eff
 ect of all variables except age at fi
 rst 
intercourse. Logistic regression with interaction terms 
was also used to assess whether associations between 
factors and conception in women younger than 18 years 
had changed between 1999–2001 and 2010–12. Analyses 
using Natsal data also included bivariate tabulations and 
logistic regression to examine the prevalence in 1990–91, 
1999–2001, and 2010–12 of participation in work, 
education, or training in women aged 18–24 years, 
according to whether or not they had a child conceived 
before age 18 years. Logistic regression with interaction 
terms was used to assess whether the association 
between early motherhood and participation changed 
over time. All analyses were done with Stata 12.1 
(version 13; StataCorp LP, College Station, Texas), 
accounting for stratifi
 cation, clustering, and weighting of 
the Natsal data.

Results
Routinely collected national data for conceptions in 
women younger than 18 years show a steady decline 
from their peak in 1998, with an apparent acceleration in 
that decline from 2007 onwards (fi
 gure 1). The trend was 
initially driven by the decline in maternities, until 2007 
when the plot lines for abortions and births converged.
The annual rates of conception in women younger 
than 18 years by quartile of area-related deprivation 
between 1994 and 2013 declined across all deprivation 
levels but this decline was larger in the most deprived 
areas (fi
 gure 2). Between 1998 and 2013, for example, 
conception rate declined by 16 conceptions per 
1000 women aged 15–17 years in the least deprived areas 
compared with 33 conceptions per 1000 women aged 
15–17 years living in the most deprived areas. This 
diff
 erential decline has resulted in a partial convergence 
in conception rates in women younger than 18 years 
across the quartiles of deprivation.
The annual data for the same period by quartile of 
strategy-related expenditure at local level—ie, per head 
total Local Implementation Grant investment—showed 
partial gradual convergence in conception rates in 
women younger than 18 years across Local Imple-
mentation Grant quartiles, with the greatest decline in 
areas receiving the highest Local Imple 
mentation Grant 
award (fi
 gure 2). Between 1998 and 2013, areas receiving 
the highest Local Implementation Grant award had a 
decline of 34 conceptions per 1000 women aged 
15–17 years, whereas in areas receiving the lowest level, 
the decline was 16 conceptions per 1000 women aged 
15–17 years.
Regression analyses assessing the association between 
Teenage Pregnancy Strategy funding and decline in 
conception rates in women younger than 18 years showed 
an estimated reduction in the conception rate of 11·4 
(95% CI 9·6–13·2; p<0·0001) per 1000 women aged 
15–17 years for every £100 Teenage Pregnancy Strategy 
spend per head (table 1). After adjustment for 
socioeconomic deprivation and region, this trend 
retained statistical signifi
 cance, with a reduction of 
8·2 conceptions (5·8–10·5; p<0·0001) per 1000 women 
aged 15–17 years per £100 Teenage Pregnancy Strategy 
spend per head. This trend was also refl
 ected when 
modelling the percentage change in conception rates in 
women younger than 18 years as the outcome; for every 
£100 Teenage Pregnancy Strategy spend per head, a 
6·2% (95% CI 2·3–10·2) reduction in the conception 
rate in women younger than 18 years was reported after 
adjusting for region and deprivation. Testing of quadratic 
terms indicated that associations with Teenage Pregnancy 
Strategy spend per head (and Index of Multiple 
Deprivation score) were approximately linear over the 
range of values considered for both absolute and 
percentage change, although the two models are not 
strictly compatible. The value of I² for both meta-
regression analyses was almost 100% because the 
outcome estimates from the top-tier local authorities are 
all very precise as they are based on rates from tens of 
thousands of person-years, and hence the variability seen 
is interpreted as variability in the underlying change 
across top-tier local authorities.
The prevalence and odds ratios (ORs) of conception in 
women younger than 18 years by selected characteristics 
of women aged 18–24 years in 1999–2001 (Natsal-2) and 
2010–12 (Natsal-3) are shown (table 2). Comparisons 
between the two surveys must be cautiously made because 
of minor but possibly important diff
 erences in question 
formulation. However, with this proviso and within the 
limits of precision of the estimates for the 18–24-year-old 
age group, the results for the two survey waves are broadly 
similar with regard to the prevalence of behaviour likely to 
be proximally and causally associated with conception.

qualifi
 cations was, however, appreciably higher in 2010–12 
(Natsal-3) compared with 1999–2001 (Natsal-2), as was the 
proportion reporting school lessons as their main source 
of sex education. A more modest increase between the 
two timepoints in the proportion reporting use of reliable 
contraception at fi
 rst intercourse was noted.
Lower 
socioeconomic 
status, 
lower 
educational 
attainment, earlier onset of sexual activity, receiving sex 
education from sources other than school and, more 
weakly, negative opinion about the timing of fi
 rst 
intercourse were associated with higher conception in 
women younger than 18 years in both surveys. Interaction 
testing revealed little clear evidence of change in the 
association with conception in women younger than 
18 years between surveys for any of the factors considered 
(all p values were greater than 0·05 and are not shown). 
However, the association between living in an area in the 
highest quintile of deprivation and conception in women 
younger than 18 years was somewhat weaker in Natsal-3 
than in Natsal-2, (Natsal-2 1999–2001: adjusted OR [AOR] 
5·18 [95% CI 1·91–14·05]); Natsal-3 2010–12: AOR 2·89 
[1·25–6·67]). A similar fi
 nding was seen for educational 
level. Having minimum or no academic qualifi
 cations 
was strongly associated with conception in both surveys, 
but the AOR was somewhat lower in Natsal-3 than in 
Natsal-2 (Natsal-2 1999–2001: AOR 5·61 [2·97–10·62]; 
Natsal-3 2010–12: AOR 3·61 [2·29–5·67]). The weaker 
association between use of reliable contraception at fi
 rst 
intercourse and conception in women younger than 
18 years was further attenuated between Natsal-2 and 
Natsal-3.
Results from Natsal-1, Natsal-2, and Natsal-3 relating to 
the participation of women aged 18–24 years according to 
whether or not they had conceived a child before age 
18 years are shown (table 3). Estimates should be treated 
with caution because of the comparatively small survey 
subsamples in the 18–24-year-old age group. The results 
for all three surveys show the proportion of women in 
education, work, or training at the time of interview was 
higher by a considerable order of magnitude in those 
who did not conceive a child before 18 years than in those 
who did (table 3). However, although the likelihood of 
participation of women who were not young mothers 
was unchanged across the three surveys (1999–2001 vs 
1990–91: OR 1·21 [95% CI 0·93–1·58]; 2010–12 vs 
1999–2001: 0·86 [0·67–1·11]), in young mothers it 
remained constant between Natsal-1 and Natsal-2, but 
doubled between Natsal-2 and Natsal-3 (1999–2001 vs 
1990–91: 1·12 [0·56–2·25]; 2010–12 vs 1999–2001: 1·99 
[0·99–4·00]). Consequently, the association between 
young motherhood and participation weakened sub-
stantially between Natsal-2 and Natsal-3.
Discussion
We report a marked decline in conceptions in women 
younger than 18 years, which was greater in areas of 
greater deprivation and also in areas of higher Teenage 
Pregnancy Strategy investment. The steep deprivation 
gradient previously associated with conception in women 
younger than 18 years has been partly attenuated. 
Similarly, the association between conception before 
age 18 years and lower educational level remains 
signifi
 cant but has weakened over the period. Young

people increasingly learn about sexual matters mainly 
from school lessons, and the association between 
conception before age 18 years and receiving sex 
education from other sources remains strong. The 
prevalence of participation in education, work, and 
training in women with a child conceived before age 
18 years, although low, increased between 1999–2001 and 
2010–12, a trend not seen in other, same-aged women.
Reductions in rates of teenage pregnancy—ie, those 
occurring before age 20 years—have been seen in other 
high-income countries,13 indicating a broader secular 
trend. Fewer comparative data exist specifi
 cally on 
pregnancies in women younger than 18 years, and hardly 
any include abortion data. However, data for the birth 
rate in women younger than 18 years in the European 
Union between 2004 and 2014 show a decline from 13·6

deprived areas but remained unchanged or decreased in 
those in more affl
  uent areas.14,15 The increase in economic 
participation of teenage mothers seen in our data after 
2000, is also a reversal of a previous trend. In 2005, we 
reported data from Natsal-1 and Natsal-2,16 which showed 
a widening gap at the end of the 20th century in the life 
chances and material prosperity of women who became 
mothers at an early age and those who did not. The 
recent improvement has occurred despite the less 
favourable economic climate in the post-2008 recession 
period, when the disparity between rich and poor has 
increased.
The decline in teenage pregnancy rates has been 
diff
 erentially attributed to distal factors such as increased 
educational attainment and to more proximal factors 
such as improved use of contraception. Researchers 
fi
 nding a strong association between falling teenage 
pregnancy rates and increasing use of long-acting 
reversible contraception in England since the late 1990s 
have underlined the contribution of increased access to 
reliable contraception to the decline.17 Observers in the 
USA have reached similar conclusions18 supported by 
intervention studies examining the eff
 ect of providing 
highly eff
 ective contraception free of charge.19 By contrast, 
researchers using ecological analyses of routinely 
collected area-level data in England to examine 
the 
association 
between 
educational 
attainment, 
contraceptive use, and trends in conception in women 
younger than 18 years concluded that the larger 
association with education indicates that this is the 
key driver.20 Interpreting the associations between 
educational level, eff
 ective contraception, and early 
pregnancy is diffi
  cult because of the likelihood of reverse 
causality. Low educational attainment is both a cause and 
consequence of teenage pregnancy. The eff
 ect of use of 
highly reliable contraception in reducing early conception 
rates might be masked in research by the tendency for 
women who experience early pregnancy to subsequently 
use more reliable methods. Our fi
 ndings suggest that 
contraceptive use and educational attainment each wield 
an independent infl
 uence on the likelihood of conception 
in women younger than 18 years. Because Natsal asks 
about contraception in the last year and ever, we are 
unable to measure use at the time of conception, and so 
reliable method use at fi
 rst intercourse has been used as 
a proxy indicator in these analyses. However, unpublished 
Natsal data show a two-fold increase in use of long-acting 
reversible contraception methods by sexually active 
16–17 year olds between Natsal-2 and Natsal-3.
Both increases in educational attainment and in use of 
highly eff
 ective contraception are likely to have 
contributed to the falling teenage pregnancy rate.

contraception the means by which to avert early 
pregnancy. Both are clearly policy related. Other studies 
have shown that multiple interventions (combining 
educational and behavioural interventions) lower the rate 
of teenage pregnancy21 and highlight the importance of 
education in planning policies with this as their aim.22 
This was refl
 ected in the decision by the English 
Government to locate the unit responsible for the 
Teenage Pregnancy Strategy jointly in two government 
ministries, the Department of Education and the 
Department of Health, and to make joint working 
between education and health agencies a key component 
of the strategy.
A strength of this study lies in the combination of 
individual-level and area-level data, and in our capacity to 
show independent associations between conception rates 
in women younger than 18 years and possibly infl
 uential 
variables. However, slight changes in question wording 
between the surveys might have infl
 uenced responses 
relating to pregnancy in Natsal-2 and Natsal-3. In 
particular, we should note that abortions were slightly 
under-reported in Natsal-3 compared with the offi
  cial UK 
fi
 gure in 2011.23
Compared with experimental approaches, observational 
studies have limitations in assessing the relative eff
 ect of 
policy-related intervention and secular trends on health 
outcomes. Specifi
 cally in this case, Teenage Pregnancy 
Strategy funding was determined by the pre-intervention 
conception rate. This creates challenges in disentangling 
the eff
 ect of Teenage Pregnancy Strategy funding from 
the eff
 ects of the pre-intervention rate on the subsequent 
conception rate, including the potential for regression 
to the mean. Our fi
 nding of an association between 
the decline in conception rates in women younger 
than 18 years and Teenage Pregnancy Strategy 
resourcing is suggestive that government-linked eff
 orts 
have contributed towards lowering conception rates in 
women younger than 18 years but should not be seen as 
conclusive.
Individual-level-data have also enabled us to show, 
where analyses of area-related data have not,24 the 
progress that has been made in reducing the previously 
strong link between deprivation and early conception. 
The comparatively greater decline in conception rate in 
women younger than 18 years in the most deprived areas 
is worthy of note. Although the potential for decline 
might have been greater where baseline conception rates 
were higher, these were often areas in which complex 
and multiple social and health problems competed for 
public health eff
 orts and resources.
Progress has been made towards halting the cycle of 
poverty and income inequality long associated with early 
pregnancy, and in improving the life chances of young 
mothers. Despite this success, England’s teenage 
pregnancy prevalence remains high compared with other 
high-income countries,25 and there is more to be achieved. 
Some have suggested, because improvements in use of 
eff
 ective contraception seem to have contributed to the 
decrease in rates, that the policy emphasis should be 
placed where it has been successful in the past. Higher 
contraception discontinuation rates in young people26 
favour their use of long-acting reversible contraception 
and additional progress could be made by accelerating the 
rate at which they are used after onset of sexual activity. 
Despite the increase in use of these methods, they are 
used by barely one in six teenage women. The strong and 
sustained association between conception in women 
younger than 18 years and earlier sexual activity suggests 
that sizeable additional gains might also be made by 
helping young women to become sexually active at a time 
that is right for them.27 A third of all young women, and 
60% of those for whom fi
 rst sex occurs before age 
16 years, subsequently consider that to have been too 
early for them. Bringing actual timing of fi
 rst sexual 
encounter in line with preference for timing of fi
 rst 
sexual encounter could cut teenage pregnancy rates 
further, and an intensifi
 ed policy focus aimed at achieving 
this might be warranted.
Our data also underline the importance of continued 
eff
 orts to prevent teenage pregnancy. The decrease in 
conception rates in women younger than 18 years was 
more substantial in the later years of the Teenage 
Pregnancy Strategy and before then, there was scope for 
detractors to dismiss it as having failed to reach its 
goals.28,29 Our interim study of the assessment of the 
Teenage Pregnancy Strategy in 2006 showed modest 
falls in the fi
 rst 4 years of the strategy, albeit more 
marked in poorer areas of the country30 in which 
government investment had been greatest. From 2007, 
however, pregnancy rates began to decrease more steeply 
and the downward trend continued after the strategy was 
mainstreamed in 2010. The acceleration is partly 
explained by the likelihood that strategy-related 
intervention took time to be implemented. It might also 
refl
 ect the renewed eff
 orts mounted in 2006 to mobilise 
additional resources and to persuade senior stakeholders 
to prioritise the issue in areas in which multiple 
socioeconomic problems were impeding progress, 
which is coincidental with a steeper decline in conception 
rates in women younger than 18 years in these areas in 
the later years of the Teenage Pregnancy Strategy. A 
further factor possibly contributing to the decrease in 
conception rates in women younger than 18 years is 
the synergy between strategy-related initiatives and 
other therapeutic and policy-related intervention—the 
availability 
of 
emergency 
contraception 
without 
prescription, for example, the recommendation by the 
National Institute for Health and Care Excellence that 
access to long-acting reversible contraception should be 
increased, and the rise in educational attainment in 
young people. Taken as a whole, the evidence underlines 
the importance of long-term, sustained, multifaceted 
prevention strategies to tackle the more intractable 
public health challenges.
