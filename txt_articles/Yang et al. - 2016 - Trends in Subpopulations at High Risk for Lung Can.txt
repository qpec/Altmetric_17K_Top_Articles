Abstract
Introduction—Two thirds of newly diagnosed lung cancer patients in the U.S. would not meet 
the current USPSTF (United States Preventive Services Task Force) screening criteria, suggesting 
a need for amendment to the high-risk definition. To provide evidence of additional high-risk 
subpopulations and estimated gains and losses, we conducted a two-step study using three cohorts.

 Methods—Two prospective cohorts are comprised of 5988 primary lung cancer patients 
diagnosed between 1997-2011 (Hospital) and 850 defined-community residents (Community); the 
retrospective cohort is the Olmsted County population (Minnesota, USA) followed for 28 years 
(1984-2011). Subgroups of lung cancer patients who might have been identified using additional 
determinates were estimated and compared between Community and Hospital cohorts. Findings 
were supported by indirect comparative projections of two ratios: benefit to harm and cost to 
effectiveness.
Results—Former cigarette smokers with 30 or more pack-years and 15-30 quit-years age 55-80 
formed the largest subgroup not meeting the current screening criteria, constituting 12% of the 
hospital cohort and 17% of community cohort. Using the expanded criteria suggested by our study 
may add 19% more CT examinations for detecting 16% more cases when comparing to the 
USPSTF criteria. Meanwhile, the increases of false positive, over-diagnosed and radiation-related 
lung cancer death are 0.6%, 0.1%, and 4.0%, respectively.
Conclusions—Current USPSTF screening criteria exclude many patients at high risk for lung 
cancer. Individuals who are under 81 years, had 30 or more pack-year smoking history, and had 
quit for 15-30 years may significantly increase the number of non-over diagnosis screen-detected 
lung cancers, does not significantly add false positive cases, saves more lives, yet with an 
acceptable amount of elevated scan exposure and cost.

INDRODUCTION
With the declining percentage of the United States population who smoke, lung cancer 
incidence and mortality have been decreasing among men in the past three decades, and only 
recently, has shown decrease among women.1 Meanwhile, former cigarette smokers remain 
at a high risk for lung cancer although at lower risk than they would have been had they 
continued smoking2. As a consequence, more people with lung cancer are now diagnosed in 
former smokers rather than in current smokers.3 Specifically, less than 18% of United States 
adults are current smokers and more than 30% are former smokers.3, 4 As of 2014, use of 
low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) screening for lung cancer was recommended by 
the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), i.e., to annually screen people 
aged 55-80 years of age who have smoked 30 or more pack-years of cigarettes and are either 
current smokers or have quit within 15 years.5, 6 This recommendation was based on the 
entry criteria of the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) but with an extension of the 
upper age limit of 74.7 However, our recent report showed that approximately two thirds of 
newly diagnosed lung cancer patients would not have met the current USPSTF high-risk 
criteria for LDCT screening.8 Particularly, we found a 24% fall-off in meeting screening-
eligibility criteria (from 57% in 1984-1990 to 43% in 2005-2011) which exceeded the 17% 
decline in incidence of lung cancer (from 53 to 44/100,000) over the same time intervals. 
Herein we have conducted further investigations to delineate the high-risk subpopulations 
based on evidence from two prospective lung cancer patient cohorts and a retrospective 
community cohort. Our goal was to improve the identification of individuals at high-risk for

 lung cancer by (1) demonstrating the chronological patterns of patients who would have 
been the beneficiaries or missed-outs under USPSTF criteria for lung cancer screening in 
two contrasting cohorts, and (2) providing indirect evidence of a new subpopulation that 
should be considered in the definition of high risk and the potential benefit versus harm as 
well as projected cost versus effectiveness.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study population
This study included two steps: description and validation. Step I utilized two prospectively-
followed lung cancer cohorts, one based on Mayo Clinic referral patients (i.e., the Hospital 
Cohort, N=5988) and another from Olmsted County (Minnesota USA) residents (i.e., the 
Community Cohort, N=850). The Hospital Cohort included patients diagnosed with 
pathologically confirmed primary lung cancer at Mayo Clinic in Minnesota during a 15-year 
period (between January 1, 1997 and December 31, 2011)9 who were not Olmsted County 
residents. The Community Cohort was matched to the same 15 years of diagnosis as the 
Hospital Cohort.8 All cases were identified using the Rochester Epidemiology Project 
database, which has maintained a comprehensive medical record linkage system for over 60 
years of almost all persons residing in Olmsted County.10, 11 This population comprises 
~140,000 persons of whom 83% are non-Hispanic white, is socioeconomically similar to the 
US white population, and a representative of the Midwestern US population. More details 
were published previously.8, 12 This study was approved by the Institutional Review Boards 
of Mayo Clinic and Olmsted County Medical Center.
Step II was to provide indirect evidence supporting the findings in Step I. We have derived 
comparative benefit-to-harm and cost-to-effectiveness among three sets of criteria: NLST, 
USPSTF, and the expanded criteria suggested by our study (Our Study in brief), based on 
the information provided in the models by de Koning et al.6 Although hypothetical and 
indirect, the comprehensive models built by de Koning and colleagues are very helpful in 
initial evaluation of the impact (positive and negative) of a potential high-risk subpopulation 
given the lack of individual-level smoking history data or up-to-date and accurate smoking 
history information for entire populations of interest. Briefly, the modeling groups 
standardized input data on smoking histories and non–lung cancer mortality to simulate life 
histories of the U.S. cohort born in 1950, which uses an updated version of the National 
Cancer Institute's Smoking History Generator. Their models assumed 100% screening 
adherence; the data derived from trials with short duration (e.g., 4-9 years) were extrapolated 
to lifetime follow-up, and smoking history data from 1-2 decade ago were assumed 
current.6, 13-16
Specifically, we have adapted and integrated the following 11 items selected from the Tables 
1 and 2 in the article by de Konig and colleagues:6 1. total CT examinations, including 
screening, 2. screening detected cases, 3. reduction in lung cancer mortality, 4. total cases 
detected at an early stage, 5. average screening exam nations per person screened, 6. 
screening examinations per lung cancer death averted, 7. screening examinations per life 
year gained, 8. average false-positive results per person screened, 9. over-diagnosis, 10.

 over-diagnosis percent of screening-detected cases, and 11.radiation-related lung cancer 
deaths.
Their comprehensive models standardized input data on smoking histories and non–lung 
cancer mortality to simulate life histories of the U.S. 1950 birth cohort.15-18 We used a 
screening program “A-55-80-30-25” in the models of de Koning et al, meaning annual 
LDCT start age at 55-years, stop age (80-year), ≥30 pack-years smoked, and ≤25 years since 
quitting; this model is most similar to our findings as supported by our previous work.2, 8
Data collection
For each patient, medical records were reviewed and abstracted for information including 
demographics (age, gender, and race); occupational exposure history; tobacco exposure 
history; lung cancer histology, staging, treatment modality; family history of lung cancer and 
other co-morbidity conditions. For the hospital cohort, information was also obtained from 
an interview and/or a follow-up questionnaire. The patient interview and/or annual follow-up 
questionnaire obtained detailed information on tobacco history, occupational exposure 
history, and family cancer history. Tobacco history information included current or former 
use, duration, the average amount of cigarettes smoked per day, and the number of years 
since quitting smoking. Current smokers were defined as those actively smoking and 
included those who had stopped smoking within one year prior to their lung cancer 
diagnosis. Former smoker were defined as having quit smoking for ≥1 or more years before 
diagnosis. Never smokers were defined as those who had smoked fewer than 100 cigarettes 
during his or her lifetime. Pack-years are calculated by multiplying the number of packs 
smoked daily by the number of years smoked. The history of chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease (COPD) was determined based on explicit diagnosis documented in the medical 
history with pulmonary function tests in the medical record. Family history of lung cancer 
was defined as having at least one first-degree relative (parent, sibling or offspring) with 
lung cancer. Positive exposure to asbestos was based on self-reported direct contact with the 
asbestos-containing material for at least a year and corroborated by the occupation history 
(job titles and tasks) at least 5 years prior to lung cancer diagnosis.
Statistical Analysis
In Step I, we did three descriptive analyses: (1) Calculating and sorting the frequencies of 
selected key characteristics as follows: age groups (50-54, 55-80, >80); smoking status (ever 
vs. never smokers), cigarettes: pack-years (pack-years, <20, 20-30, >30), and quitting 
smoking years (quit-years <15, 15-30, >30); prior histories of COPD, lung cancer, and 
asbestos exposure; and family history of lung cancer in first-degree relatives; (2) illustrating 
by pie charts of subgroups by frequency in those not meeting USPSTF criteria; (3) 
calculating and illustrating distribution of pack-years and quit-years in patients not meeting 
USPSTF Criteria.
In Step II, we have made three levels of hypothetical comparisons: first is the relative gain of 
USPSTF versus NLST, second is our study versus NLST, and the third is the relative gain of 
our study versus USPSTF. For clarity and simplicity in comparisons, we set the estimates of 
NLST as the standardized reference values at 100 or 100% when involving the actual

 numbers, e.g., total CT examinations and screening detected cases. For parameters of 
common knowledge, e.g., reduction in lung cancer mortality and total cases detected at an 
early stage, the original model-based percentage for NLST was used as the comparator, with 
the predicted change (in %) by USPSTF and Our Study. For the estimated means, e.g., 
average screening examinations per person screened per life year gained, average false-
positive results per person screened, and over-diagnosis of screening-detected cases, the 
original model-based average for NLST was used as the comparator, with the predicted 
change (in %) by USPSTF and Our Study.
RESULTS
Patients’ Characteristics of the Two Prospective Lung Cancer Cohorts
Table 1 presents basic information and comparisons of 5988 hospital and 850 community 
lung cancer cohorts, diagnosed between 1997 and 2011. Patients’ characteristics differed 
between the two cohorts, reflecting the typical referral bias in a tertiary medical center. All 
variables but sex ratio are significantly different; specifically, compared to the community 
cohort, the hospital cohort is younger, higher representation of never smokers, lighter 
smokers, and long-term quitters. Despite these differences, the two cohorts showed 
remarkably consistent results in following three aspects:
1. Subgroups Outside of USPSTF Screening Criteria—Figure 1 illustrates the 
relative proportions of the screening eligible and ineligible for the two patient cohorts, by the 
order of subgroup frequency. For individuals under more than one variable, they were 
grouped within the larger subgroup. The frequencies of the selected risk factors in each 
cohort are summarized in Supplementary Table 1. Using the Community Cohort as a 
standard reference group (Figure 1A), 46% of cases were found to meet the USPSTF 
criteria, whereas only 38% were found for the Hospital Cohort. Outside of the portion under 
the USPSTF screening criteria, we compared eight factors of the patients in terms of 
additional intensity categories of tobacco smoking exposure, age 50-54 years at the time of 
diagnosis, family and personal history of lung cancer, prior history of COPD and asbestos 
exposure. The two most frequently occurring characteristics in both cohorts are “quit 
smoking 15-30 years” (12% and 17%) and “smoked 20-30 pack-years” (6.3% and 6.2%). In 
both cohorts, “history of COPD” (1.9% vs. 2.2%) and “personal lung cancer history” (0.3% 
vs. 0.6%) were the lowest in frequency among all presented factors.
2. Distribution of Pack-years and Quit-years in Patients Ineligible under 
USPSTF Criteria—We examined the distribution of pack-years and quit-years in those 
less than 81 years old and ineligible by the USPSTF screening criteria in both cohorts, as 
depicted in Figure 2 (A-B); clearly standing out is the subgroup of those with ≥30 pack-
years and having quit smoking for more than 15 years. Therefore, we propose an addition to 
the current USPSTF screening criteria by adding former smokers who quit smoking 15-30 
years and had at least a 30 pack-year history.
3. Temporal Pattern Change by NLST and USPSTF Screening Criteria—In the 
Community cohort, 35.7% of the total patients would have met the entry criteria of the

 NLST, and 45.8% met the USPSTF screening criteria. In the Hospital cohort, only 33.4% 
and 38.2% would have met the respective criteria. Figure 3 (A-B) illustrates the relative 
proportion of alternative criteria over three 5-year intervals of both cohorts (i.e., 1997-2001, 
2002-2006, and 2007-2011). The bottom proportion for each bar presents the NLST criteria 
(55–74 years, smoked at least 30 pack-years, and former smokers quitting 15 years or 
fewer); the middle proportion is for age group 75-80 (extended by USPSTF); and the top 
proportion shows our proposed addition of former smokers with 30+ pack years and 15-30 
quit years. More specifically, in the Community cohort (Figure 3A), the proportion of 
patients who were NLST-eligible decreased from 40.8% to 31.9% (P=0.017), and the 
USPSTF-eligible decreased from 53.2% to 40.5% (P=0.002) over these 15 years. On the 
other hand, the proportion of the proposed criteria increased; particularly noted is coverage 
of patients meeting the proposed criteria at the most recent time interval was at 52%.
The same decreasing eligibility trends were observed in the Hospital cohort (Figure 3B): the 
NLST-eligible from 35.2% to 31.0% (P=0.003) and the USPSTF-eligible from 40.3% to 
35.1% (P<0.001). More strikingly in the most recent time interval, the proportion of lung 
cancer cases added by the quit-years 15-30 subgroup (17.6%), is over 4-times larger than the 
addition of 75-80 year-of-age by USPSTF (4.1%) to the NLST criteria.
Potential Benefit versus Harm and Projected Cost versus Effectiveness
Table 2 provides hypothetical projections of benefit versus harm and cost versus 
effectiveness through eleven itemized comparisons (labeled columns 1-11), reflecting 
meaningful relative gains and losses of the three sets of criteria: NLST, USPSTF, and Our 
Study, purposefully not involving actual expense and productivity measures. Five illustrative 
points of pros and cons are listed below.
1.
Balance of total computed tomography (CT) screening examinations and 
screening detected lung cancer cases (columns 1 and 2): comparing to 
NLST estimates at 100 as a reference, the USPSTF would add 8.2% more 
total CT examinations for 19.7% gain in screening-detected lung cancer 
cases; whereas our study suggested criteria (“Our Study” in brief) may add 
29% more total CT examinations for 39% gain in screening-detected lung 
cancer cases. Our Study versus USPSTF: 19% more CT examinations as a 
trade of 16% more lung cancer cases detected.
2.
In the models where NLST reduces lung cancer mortality at 12.3%, a 
greater reduction in mortality may be achieved as suggested by our study 
than the predicted reduction by USPSTF (column 3, i.e., 15.8% [12.3+3.5] 
vs. 14% [12.3+1.7]). Our Study versus USPSTF: a 1.8% deeper reduction 
in lung cancer mortality.
3.
In the models where 48.4% of the total detected cases in NLST were in 
early stage, a higher proportion of early-stage lung cancer may be 
achieved as suggested by our study than the predicted increase by 
USPSTF (column 4, i.e., 52.1% [48.4+3.7] vs. 50.5% [48.4+2.1]). Our 
Study versus USPSTF: a 1.6% increase in detecting lung cancer at an 
early stage.

 4.
Weighing the average screening examinations per person screened 
(column 5), per lung cancer death averted (column 6), and per life year 
gained (column 7), the reference of NLST yielded 13.3, 577, and 49, 
respectively. Compared to the NLST, USPSTF gained 1.1, 3 and 3; Our 
Study gained 3.1, 6, and 5, respectively. Our Study versus USPSTF: an 
increase in average screening examinations by 2 per person screened, by 3 
per lung cancer death averted, and by 2 per life-year gained by 2, 
respectively.
5.
Concerns of false positivity (column 8), over-diagnosed cases (columns 
9-10), and radiation-related lung cancer death (column 11): The increases 
of false positive, over-diagnosed and radiation-related lung cancer death 
are minimal by all comparisons.
DISCUSSION
Based on the latest data from Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) and 
National Program of Cancer Registries (NPCR), lung cancer incidence in the United States 
peaked in 1984 among men while continuing to increase among women until 2006.19 We 
found a similar trend in Olmsted County population (Figure 4), supporting the 
generalizability and validity of our data to be representative of the United States general 
population. During 2005-2012, the proportion of heavy smokers who smoked ≥30 cigarettes 
per day in the United States declined significantly, from 12.6% to 7.0%.3 Our recent report 
revealed that less than 40% of subjects diagnosed with lung cancer would meet the USPSTF 
screening criteria,8 confirming the need to expand the current criteria if the desire is to target 
the population at high risk.20, 21
Since 2002, former smokers have outnumbered current smokers; and from 1998 to 2012, the 
proportion of US adults who were current cigarette smokers declined from 24.1% to 
18.1%.3, 4 Former smokers remain at greatly elevated risk relative to never smokers even 
though lower than if they had continued to smoke.2, 14-15 The fact that majority of lung 
cancer cases diagnosed in the United States today are former smokers reflects success in 
smoking cessation efforts, which also reflects continued high-risk status of former 
smokers.22-25 We specifically evaluated quitting smoking 15-30 years because our previous 
study showed the risk of lung adenocarcinoma remained elevated up to 30 years beyond 
smoking cessation for both former heavy and light smokers.2 We also have reported a trend 
that the proportion of lung cancer patients who smoked ≥30 pack-years was decreasing and 
former smokers who quit smoking ≥15 years were increasing over time in Olmsted County.8 
A striking observation from the current study is the distribution of pack-years and quit-years 
in those ineligible under USPSTF criteria, as in Figure 2, where we found that, compared to 
other risk categories, “quit smoking 15-30 years” accounted for the greatest percentage of 
those with lung cancer.
Our results also showed that, compared to the NLST entry criteria, lung cancer cases in 
Community and Hospital cohorts who met the USPSTF criteria only increased by 
4.1%-8.6% (Figure 3, 2007-2011). In contrast, when adding former smokers with 15-30

 quit-years, the increase in those meeting criteria that actually got lung cancer was 
13.3%-17.6%. Therefore, assuming screening could reduce mortality and be cost-effective in 
the same magnitude as expected without increasing harm, high-risk subpopulations outside 
of USPSTF criteria need to be reconsidered, especially those who have sustained smoking 
cessation beyond 15 years. Taking advantage of the patients from the Olmsted County 
population, we were able to compare the local and referral patients whose lung cancer was 
diagnosed during the same time period (Figure 4).
We acknowledge several limitations. First, data from Olmsted County may not be 
generalizable to the entire United States in terms of racial distribution, disease patterns, and 
access to care. Individuals of Caucasian race, known to have lower incidence of lung cancer, 
are overrepresented in Olmsted County. Second, although we found that “quit smoking 
15-30 years” and “smoked 20-30 pack-years” are the two highest percentages of patient 
subgroups in both cohorts, the proportions of patients older than 81 years, never smokers, 
history of COPD, and history of asbestos exposure in the hospital cohort differ from the 
community cohort, likely due to the referral practice and patients’ self-preference. Third, we 
were unable to develop a prediction model for individualized lung cancer risk assessment, as 
reported by other studies,26-31 which require complete data on all known risk factors in the 
entire Olmsted County population; such data is not currently available. However, based on 
the modeling data provided by de Koning and colleagues,6 we were able to indirectly project 
the impact of extending the screened population to include former smokers of >15 years 
cessation, which may significantly increase the number of non-over diagnosis screen-
detected lung cancers, saves more lives, have an acceptable amount of increased scan 
exposure and cost, yet unlikely add significantly false positive cases.
Nonetheless, our two prospective patient cohorts differed significantly in many aspects but 
provided consistent study results, from the case-detection perspective, i.e., the relative 
proportions of diagnosed lung cancer patients with known risk factors. This is one of the 
efficient designs to capture, in a timely manner, whether the end results of a disease under 
screening reasonably reflects the pre-defined high-risk population, although the most 
definitive answer to justify a change in high-risk definition being cost effectiveness requires 
directly calculating risks, having the denominator to know the number needed to screen, and 
how screening is implemented in the real world.32
CONCLUSIONS
In both Community and Hospital Cohorts, the trend in percentage of lung cancer patients 
who met the USPSTF screening inclusion criteria decreased between 1997 and 2011. The 
decreasing trend of screening-eligibility in both cohorts exceeded the decline in incidence 
over time, which demonstrates that the current lung cancer screening entry criteria did not 
identify those who actually got lung cancer. Inclusion of identifiable high-risk 
subpopulations should be reconsidered to improve current screening criteria. Our current and 
previous studies provide evidence that former smokers with 15-30 quit-years remain at high 
risk and should be considered as eligible for LDCT screening for lung cancer. The current 
USPSTF recommendation to stop screening after 15 years of smoking cessation is not

 reflective of continued high risk, although participation of the expanded population in 
screening setting needs to be further evaluated.
