IMPORTANCE The optimal duration of antibiotic treatment for community-acquired
pneumonia (CAP) has not been well established.
OBJECTIVE To validate Infectious Diseases Society of America/American Thoracic Society
guidelines for duration of antibiotic treatment in hospitalized patients with CAP.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This study was a multicenter, noninferiority randomized
clinical trial performed at 4 teaching hospitals in Spain from January 1, 2012, through August
31, 2013. A total of 312 hospitalized patients diagnosed as having CAP were studied. Data
analysis was performed from January 1, 2014, through February 28, 2015.
INTERVENTIONS Patients were randomized at day 5 to an intervention or control group.
Those in the intervention group were treated with antibiotics for a minimum of 5 days, and
the antibiotic treatment was stopped at this point if their body temperature was 37.8°C or less
for 48 hours and they had no more than 1 CAP-associated sign of clinical instability. Duration
of antibiotic treatment in the control group was determined by physicians.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Clinical success rate at days 10 and 30 since admission and
CAP-related symptoms at days 5 and 10 measured with the 18-item CAP symptom
questionnaire score range, 0-90; higher scores indicate more severe symptoms.
RESULTS Of the 312 patients included, 150 and 162 were randomized to the control and
intervention groups, respectively. The mean (SD) age of the patients was 66.2 (17.9) years
and 64.7 (18.7) years in the control and intervention groups, respectively. There were 95 men
(63.3%) and 55 women (36.7%) in the control group and 101 men (62.3%) and 61 women
(37.7%) in the intervention group. In the intent-to-treat analysis, clinical success was 48.6%
(71 of 150) in the control group and 56.3% (90 of 162) in the intervention group at day 10
(P = .18) and 88.6% (132 of 150) in the control group and 91.9% (147 of 162) in the
intervention group at day 30 (P = .33). The mean (SD) CAP symptom questionnaire scores
were 24.7 (11.4) vs 27.2 (12.5) at day 5 (P = .10) and 18.6 (9.0) vs 17.9 (7.6) at day 10 (P = .69).
In the per-protocol analysis, clinical success was 50.4% (67 of 137) in the control group and
59.7% (86 of 146) in the intervention group at day 10 (P = .12) and 92.7% (126 of 137) in the
control group and 94.4% (136 of 146) in the intervention group at day 30 (P = .54). The mean
(SD) CAP symptom questionnaire scores were 24.3 (11.4) vs 26.6 (12.1) at day 5 (P = .16) and
18.1 (8.5) vs 17.6 (7.4) at day 10 (P = .81).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The Infectious Diseases Society of America/American
Thoracic Society recommendations for duration of antibiotic treatment based on clinical
stability criteria can be safely implemented in hospitalized patients with CAP.

ommunity-acquired pneumonia (CAP) continues to be
a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide.1
The annual incidence of CAP ranges from 5 to 11 cases
per 1000 adults and accounts for considerable health care
costs.2,3Duringrecentdecades,strategiesofearlyinitiationand
an early switch to oral therapy have been thoroughly
evaluated.4-6 However, the optimal duration of antimicrobial
therapy is not well established.
Shortened antibiotic treatments have numerous advan-
tages. First, they have been associated with lower rates of an-
timicrobial resistance among respiratory pathogens.7 In fact,
low doses of β-lactam antibiotics for more than 5 days have
been associated with an increase in Streptococcus pneumo-
niae penicillin-resistant nasopharyngeal carriers.7 Second, re-
ducing the duration of antibiotic treatments could lead to cost
savings.8 Third, unnecessarily long treatments could result in
higher rates of adverse effects.9 Fourth, adherence may im-
prove if treatment duration is shortened.10,11
Despite these clear benefits and a few meta-analyses12,13
suggesting noninferiority of shorter treatments, reducing the
duration of treatment remains challenging in clinical prac-
tice, probably because of physicians feeling a false sense of se-
curity with longer treatments. To date, no clinical trials have
been conducted concerning duration of antibiotic treatment
in a real-world setting where clinicians can prescribe their drug
of choice among hospitalized patients with CAP with varying
degree of illness.
In 2007, the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA)
and American Thoracic Society (ATS) developed recommen-
dations for the duration of antibiotic treatment based on
stability criteria proposed by Halm et al.14 The guidelines
suggested a minimum of 5 days of treatment, patients achiev-
ing an afebrile state for 48 to 72 hours, and patients meeting
no more than 1 CAP-associated instability criteria before
therapy discontinuation.15 A longer duration was recom-
mended if the initial therapy was not active against the iden-
tified pathogen or if the patient’
s condition was complicated
by extrapulmonary infection, such as meningitis or endocar-
ditis. Most guidelines classify current recommendations as
having weak evidence mainly based on expert opinions.15-17
Despite these recommendations focused on clinical state, ar-
bitrarily longer treatments remain common.18 In an attempt
to clarify this issue and validate the IDSA/ATS guidelines for
duration of antibiotic treatment in patients with CAP, we con-
ductedamulticenterrandomizedclinicaltrialtoassesswhether
durationofantibiotictreatmentbasedonIDSA/ATScriteriawas
as effective as conventional treatment.
Methods
Study Design
This multicenter, noninferiority randomized clinical trial was
performedinallhospitalizedpatientsdiagnosedashavingCAP
in4teachinghospitalsintheBasqueCountryinSpain.Thetrial
protocol can be found in Supplement 1. Patients were as-
sessed for eligibility from day 0 to day 5 and randomized by a
researcher at day 5 to an intervention or control group using
an assigned number generated by an SAS statistical software,
version 9.4, computer program (SAS Institute Inc).
Patients in the intervention group were treated with anti-
biotics for a minimum of 5 days, and the antibiotic treatment
was stopped at this point if their body temperature was 37.8°C
orlessfor48hoursandtheyhadnomorethan1CAP-associated
signofclinicalinstability,definedassystolicbloodpressureless
than90mmHg,heartrategreaterthan100/min,respiratoryrate
greater than 24 /min, arterial oxygen saturation less than 90%,
or PaO2 less than 60 mm Hg in room air.15 In contrast, duration
ofantibioticsinthecontrolgroupwasdeterminedbyphysicians
as in clinical practice. In both groups, antibiotic type was cho-
senempiricallybyphysiciansaccordingtolocalguidelines.The
project was approved by the Basque Country Ethical Commit-
tee. All patients were informed of the study goals, and written
informed consent was obtained before their inclusion in the
study. All data were deidentified.
Setting and Study Population
Hospitalized patients diagnosed as having CAP were re-
cruited from January 1, 2012, through August 31, 2013. Data
analysis was performed from January 1, 2014, through Febru-
ary 28, 2015. Eligible patients were 18 years or older and hos-
pitalized with a diagnosis of CAP. Pneumonia was defined as
pulmonary infiltrate on chest radiography not seen previ-
ously plus at least 1 symptom compatible with pneumonia,
such as cough, fever, dyspnea, and/or chest pain. Patients were
excluded if they were infected by human immunodeficiency
virus; had chronic immunosuppression (defined as immuno-
suppression for solid organ transplantation, having under-
gone a splenectomy, receiving ≥10 mg/d of prednisone or the
equivalent for >30 days, taking other immunosuppressive
agents,orhavingneutropenia,ie,aneutrophilcount<1000/μL
[to convert to ×109/L, multiply by 0.001]); lived in a nursing
home; had been discharged from an acute care hospital, an on-
site subacute care unit, or a palliative care unit within the pre-
vious 14 days; had already taken antibiotics in the 30 days be-
fore admission; required a longer duration of therapy because
of an uncommon cause (Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Staphy-
lococcus aureus, among others); required a chest tube; or had
a condition complicated by extrapulmonary infection, such as
Key Points
Question How long should antibiotic treatment last for patients
with community-acquired pneumonia?
Findings In this randomized clinical trial that included 312
patients, the clinical success rate was 50.4% in controls and 59.7%
in the intervention group at day 10 and 92.6% in controls and
94.4% in the intervention group at day 30 without significant
differences. The community-acquired pneumonia symptom
questionnaire scores at days 5 and 10 were similar between the
groups.
Meaning Basing antibiotic treatment duration on clinical stability
criteria leads to a significant reduction in treatment duration
without increasing the rate of adverse outcomes.

meningitis or endocarditis. Patients who died or were trans-
ferred to the intensive care unit before randomization or who
declined to participate or give inform consent were also
excluded.
Data Collection
Atbaseline,demographicandclinicaldataforeachpatientwere
collected from medical records. Disease severity was deter-
mined with the Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI) calculated
within the first 4 hours after diagnosis.19 Comorbidities were
measured with the Charlson Comorbidity Index20 and pa-
tient independence in activities of daily living with the Katz
Index.21Themostabnormalvaluesofvitalsigns(systolicblood
pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and arterial oxygen satu-
ration) were recorded daily from medical records and used to
assess clinical stability.15 Antibiotic treatment was assessed ac-
cording to the Spanish Pulmonology and Thoracic Surgery
Societyguidelines.22Treatmentadherencewasmonitoreddur-
ing hospitalization by nurses and by the electronic prescrip-
tion support program once patients were discharged. Pa-
tients discharged before day 5 were trained to measure vital
signs at home, being assessed at day 5 again in the hospital.
All patients were provided with a telephone number at dis-
charge. An etiologic diagnosis was made whenever the re-
sultsofurinaryantigentestingfor Legionellapneumophilatype
1 or S pneumoniae, serologic tests, or blood or sputum cul-
tures were positive. All patients were evaluated at day 30 in a
medical consultation.
Assessment of Outcomes
The primary outcomes were clinical success rate at day 10 and
late follow-up (day 30) since admission, defined as resolu-
tion or improvement in signs and symptoms related to pneu-
monia without further antibiotics,23 and CAP-related symp-
toms at day 10 measured with the 18-item CAP symptom
questionnaire,24 a specific and validated patient-reported out-
come measure on which higher scores indicate more severe
symptoms (range, 0-90). It was initially developed in English
and then translated to 12 different languages, including
Spanish.24 Given our experience conducting the study,
some of our primary outcomes differed from those we pro-
posed in our registered protocol. Although all-cause mortal-
ity or major complications were planned as a primary
outcome, as well as clinical cure, we found that there were
too few events after day 5 to make this a good choice for the
primary outcome.
Duration of antibiotic treatment, measured as days tak-
ing antibiotics from the first dose until the interruption of
any antibiotic treatment during hospitalization and at late
follow-up (to identify the use of any other antibiotic after
hospital discharge), was listed as a principal outcome in the
protocol, but we thought this was a more appropriate sec-
ondary outcome. Our other secondary outcomes were time
until clinical improvement, defined as the number of days
patients took to feel better after discharge, provided by a
question asked of patients at day 30 about how long it took
them to feel better; time to return to normal activity, defined
as the number of days before patients returned to their rou-
tine, reported by patients at day 30 after hospital admission;
radiographic resolution at day 30 after hospital admission,
based on assessment of chest radiography performed at least
at baseline and late follow-up; in-hospital mortality; mortal-
ity at day 30 after hospital admission; CAP recurrence,
defined as new or worsening symptoms related to pneumo-
nia or appearance of a new respiratory infection in a patient
classified as cured at day 10; hospital readmissions up to day
30 from hospital admission; complications during hospital-
ization; number of days with adverse events (such as diar-
rhea or headache) attributable to antibiotics up to day 30
from hospital admission; and length of hospital stay,
measured by subtracting date of admission from date of
discharge.
Sample Size Estimation
Before starting the field study, on the basis of the results of a
similar study,25 we hypothesized that to achieve 80% power
to detect differences in the CAP symptom questionnaire mean
score lower or equal to the noninferiority margin of 3 points,
considering a 1-sided α error of .025, a mean CAP symptom
questionnaire score of 18 points in each group of patients, and
an SD in both groups of 11 units, we required at least 142 pa-
tients in each branch of the study (sampsi procedure, STATA
statistical software, version 10, StataCorp).
Statistical Analysis
Descriptive statistics included frequency tables, means (SDs),
or medians (interquartile ranges). We compared baseline char-
acteristicsbetweenpatientswhohadprotocolviolationsorwho
were unavailable for follow-up with those who did not. Base-
line characteristics of the intent-to-treat population were com-
pared between the control and intervention groups. Sub-
sequently, vital signs at day 5, antibiotic treatment, and
distribution of the causes in the per-protocol population were
compared between the groups. Primary and secondary out-
comesoftheintent-to-treatandper-protocolpopulationswere
compared between the groups. Primary outcomes were
compared between the groups stratified by PSI (classes I-III
and IV-V), antibiotic group, or hospital. Categorical variables
were compared with χ2 and Fisher exact tests and continu-
ous variables with unpaired, 2-tailed t tests or nonparamet-
ric Wilcoxon rank sum tests. Furthermore, Kaplan-Meier
curves of return to normal activity until day 30 in the intent-
to-treat and per-protocol populations were constructed for
each patient group, and comparisons were performed with
the log-rank test.
Finally, multilevel analyses were performed with mixed
modelstocompareclinicalprimaryoutcomesbetweengroups,
including a hospital-level random effect. Linear mixed mod-
els were used to compare CAP symptom questionnaire scores
at days 5 and 10 and generalized linear mixed models to com-
pare clinical success at days 10 and 30. The dependent vari-
able was the corresponding outcome, and independent vari-
ables were group (as the principal independent variable) and
hospital (as the random effect).
All effects were considered significant at P < .05, unless
otherwise stated. All statistical analysis was performed using

Results
A total of 539 patients were assessed for eligibility (Figure). Be-
fore randomization, 227 patients did not meet the selection
criteria, leaving 312 patients. Of these, 150 patients were ran-
domizedtothecontrolgroupand162totheinterventiongroup.
Themean(SD)ageofthepatientswas66.2(17.9)yearsand64.7
(18.7) years in the control and intervention groups, respec-
tively. There were 95 men (63.3%) and 55 women (36.7%) in
the control group and 101 men (62.3%) and 61 women (37.7%)
in the intervention group. Thirteen patients were later ex-
cluded for protocol violation (6 being treated with extra anti-
bioticswithin<1weekafterdischargebytheirprimarycarephy-
sician without evidence of clinical worsening and 1 leaving the
hospital voluntarily, whereas in 6 antibiotic treatment was
not stopped during hospitalization despite clinical stability
because of lack of collaboration by their physicians). In addi-
tion, 13 and 3 patients in the control and intervention groups,
respectively, were unavailable for the late follow-up. How-
ever, the status of these 16 patients was checked through
electronicmedicalrecords,andallbut1wasaliveatlatefollow-
up, whereas no information was found for the other patient.
No differences were found in terms of age, sex, comorbidi-
ties, Katz Index, and severity of disease between those who
violated the protocol or were unavailable for follow-up and
those who did not.
Baseline demographics and characteristics were similar in
the control and intervention groups (Table 1). Mean (SD) PSI
scores were 83.7 (33.7) and 81.8 (33.8) in the control and in-
tervention groups, respectively (P = .55). Vital signs at day 5
were similar in both groups (eTable 1 in Supplement 2). Nearly
80% of patients in both groups underwent treatment with qui-
nolones, whereas less than 10% were treated with a β-lactam
plus macrolide. Etiologic diagnosis was made in 35 individu-
als (26.5%) in the control group and 28 (20.5%) in the inter-
vention group (P = .25) (eTable 2 in Supplement 2).
Primary Outcomes
Clinical success rate at day 10 was 48.6% (71 of 150) in the con-
trol group and 56.3% (90 of 162) in the intervention group

clinical success at day 10, 1.9%; clinical success at day 30, 0.9%; CAP symptom
questionnaire score at day 5, 3.8%; and CAP symptom questionnaire score at
day 10, 4.4%. In the per-protocol population, the percentage of missing data
was as follows: clinical success at day 10, 2.1%; clinical success at day 30, 1.0%;
CAP symptom questionnaire score at day 5, 3.1%; and CAP symptom
questionnaire score at day 10, 3.8%.
bOn the CAP symptom questionnaire, which is a specific and validated
patient-reported outcome measure based on 18 items, higher scores indicated
more severe CAP-related symptoms (range, 0-90).

Multilevel analyses with mixed models revealed that, even
including a hospital-level random effect, differences between
the intervention and control groups in clinical success at days
10 or 30 were not significant (odds ratio, 1.54; P = .11; and odds
ratio, 1.38; P = .52, respectively, considering the control group
as the reference group). Regarding the CAP symptom question-
naire, we found significant differences between the 2 groups at
day 5, with scores being higher in the intervention group
(β = 2.71, P = .0497) but did not find significant differences at
day 10 (β = 0.12, P = .89).
Secondary Outcomes
Secondary outcomes in the intent-to treat analysis are sum-
marized in eTable 5 in Supplement 2. Time receiving antibi-
otic treatment was significantly longer in the control than the
intervention group (median, 10 days [interquartile range, 10-
11] vs 5 days [interquartile range, 5-6.5], respectively; P < .001).
Four patients (2.9%) and 101 patients (70.1%) from the con-
trol and intervention groups, respectively, were receiving an-
tibiotics for only 5 days (P < .001). No significant differences
were found between groups in time until clinical improve-
ment and days to return to normal activity measured at day
30, radiographic resolution at day 30, or adverse effects by day
30 (Table 4). Furthermore, no significant differences were
found between groups using Kaplan-Meier survival curves of
return to normal activity (eFigure in the Supplement 2) until
day 30 (mean time to return to normal activity, 16.6 and 15.4
days in the control and intervention groups, respectively; log-
rank test, P = .16).
In-hospital and 30-day mortality, in-hospital complica-
tions, recurrence by day 30, and length of hospital stay were
similar in the 2 groups (Table 4). However, readmission by day
30 was significantly more common in the control group than in
the intervention group (9 [6.6%] vs 2 [1.4%]; P = .02). Calling

dSevere sepsis was defined as sepsis associated with organ dysfunction and
perfusion abnormalities. One of the following criteria had to be met: pH less
than 7.30, systolic blood pressure less than 90 mm Hg, pneumonia-associated
altered mental status, PaO2 to fraction of inspired oxygen ratio less than
250 mm Hg, acute renal failure (creatinine level >2 mg/dL [to convert to
micromoles per liter, multiply by 88.4]), disseminated intravascular
coagulopathy, or hematocrit less than 25%.
e Renal failure was defined as a creatinine level greater than 2 mg/dL.

P = .03).
Discussion
This study indicates that withdrawing antibiotic treatment
based on clinical stability criteria after a minimum of 5 days
of appropriate treatment is not inferior to traditional treat-
ment schedules in terms of clinical success. Hence, we con-
clude that IDSA/ATS guidelines concerning duration of anti-
biotictreatmentcanbesafelyimplementedamonghospitalized
patients with CAP.15 Clinical cure rates at late follow-up were
92.7% and 94.4% in the control and intervention groups, re-
spectively, which is consistent with published data.26-28 Spe-
cifically, we were able to safely limit the duration of anti-
biotic treatment to 5 days in 101 patients (70.1%) in the
intervention group.
This is the first study, to our knowledge, to validate the
IDSA/ATS guideline recommendations for duration of anti-
biotic treatment. Determining the duration of antibiotic treat-
ment based on clinical response appears to be a better strat-
egy than using arbitrary treatment lengths. Shorter
treatments also led to less antimicrobial resistance, fewer
adverse effects, lower cost, and improved adherence. In
agreement with previous data,29 most of our patients
reached stability by day 3. Given that the IDSA/ATS guide-
lines recommend15 antibiotic treatment should be discontin-
ued after 48 hours of stability, this implies no more than 5
days of treatment in most cases, although this does not cur-
rently happen in clinical practice.
We found no differences in length of stay between the
groups probably because the day of discharge is determined
primarily by when antibiotics are switched from intrave-
nous to oral, not the overall length of treatment.6 In our
study, length of intravenous antibiotic treatment was simi-
lar in both groups. As previously reported,27 no differences
were observed in adverse effects probably because of simi-
larities in prescribed antibiotics in both arms. Surprisingly, a
higher readmission rate was observed in the control group.
All patients were provided with a telephone number at dis-
charge, leading to a higher rate of telephone calls in the
intervention group, which could have avoided readmissions
among this group.
Another notable characteristic of this study is the dis-
tinctive design under real-world conditions in which
physicians are free to choose the most appropriate antibi-
otic. We followed this strategy in an attempt to mimic clini-
cal practice.
Todate,moststudies12,13haveevaluatedoutcomesinterms
of clinical success. However, patients are known to be more
concerned about other variables, such as time until clinical im-
provement and return to normal activity. In relation to this,
we evaluated both outcomes, as reported by patients, and no
significant differences were found between short and long
courses. In addition, in an attempt to obtain more accurate in-
formation and unlike most previous research,30-33 we as-
sessed symptom severity with the CAP symptom question-
naire,observingdecreasesinscoresfromday5today10inboth
groups.
An important strength of this study is that severely ill pa-
tients were included. Although patients admitted to the in-
tensive care unit were excluded, we allowed inclusion of those
with PSI scores greater than 130 (class V). There are few data
on shortened antibiotic treatment in severe CAP. Choudhury
et al34 conducted a prospective, observational study in pa-
tients with severe CAP and did not find significant differ-
ences in 30-day mortality, need for mechanical ventilation
and/orinotropicsupport,ormajorcomplicationsbetweenshort
and long regimens. Similar to our study, they excluded
patients who died within 7 days, were admitted to the inten-
sive care unit, developed complicated pneumonia, failed to
reach clinical stability, or had positive culture results for
microorganisms requiring prolonged treatment. Still, little is
known about how shortened treatments work in critically ill
patients. In a double-blind (until day 8) randomized clinical
trial that compared 15- and 8-day courses in adults with
ventilator-associated pneumonia, Chastre et al35 found that
there was no clinical benefit to extending antibiotic treat-
ment beyond an 8-day course to 15 days in patients who had
received appropriate initial empirical therapy, with the pos-
sible exception of those with nonfermenting gram-negative
Bacillus infections.
Regarding pharmacodynamic parameters, quinolones
are known to have concentration-dependent killing activity.
Thus, high-dose regimens would tend to increase the
area under the concentration–time curve and peak plasma
concentration, making shortened antibiotic treatments
safe in terms of efficacy. In relation this, Dunbar et al27
found that 750 mg of levofloxacin for 5 days was at least as
effective as 500 mg of the same drug for 10 days in patients
with mild to severe CAP. Interestingly, our study found
similar clinical success rates even without our patients
being prescribed a higher dose of quinolones. A few
studies31,33,36 have drawn attention to macrolides, which are
known to have a long half-life and elevated pulmonary con-
centrations. D’
Ignazio et al37 observed similar success rates
when comparing a single dose of azithromycin micro-
spheres with 500 mg of levofloxacin for 7 days in outpa-
tients with CAP.
Our study has several limitations. First, almost 80% of
the patients received quinolones. Physicians selected the
antibiotic, leading to a high rate of prescription of quinolo-
nes, as is usual in Spain.38 Hence, the results probably can-
not be extrapolated to other countries where β-lactams
are widely used, such as the United Kingdom.39 Second,
because of the open design after day 5, there could have
been an effect on physicians’decisions concerning antibi-
otic duration in the control group. Nevertheless, this does
not seem to have happened because treatments were mark-
edly longer in the control group. Third, few patients with
severe disease (PSI class V) were included in this study.
Fourth, patients who received previous antibiotic treat-
ment, lived in nursing homes, were immunosuppressed, or
needed a chest tube or longer therapy for disease of an

uncommon bacteriologic origin were excluded from the
study; thus, results cannot be generalized to such patients.
Fifth, the study was conducted in 4 teaching hospitals in
the Basque Country, which could limit generalization of
the results to other countries. However, patient demo-
graphic and baseline characteristics, disease severity on
admission, process of care, and outcomes were similar to
those described in other studies.40-42
Conclusions
Our study indicates that the IDSA/ATS recommendations for
shorter duration of antibiotic treatment based on clinical
stability criteria can be safely implemented in hospitalized pa-
tients with CAP, leading to a significant reduction in treat-
ment duration.
