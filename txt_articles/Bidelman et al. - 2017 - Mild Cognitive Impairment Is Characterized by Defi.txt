Introduction
Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a prodromal stage of de-
mentia recognized as an intermediate transitional phase in the
progression of cognitive aging. Individuals with MCI show a high
rate (�40%) of progression to dementia (Roberts and Knopman,
2013) and MCI is a key risk factor (�6) for conversion to Alzhei-
mer’s disease (Roberts and Knopman, 2013). Despite progress in
identifying individuals with MCI using (neuro)psychological as-

Significance Statement
Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a precursor to dementia marked by declines in communication skills. Whether MCI patho-
physiology extends below cerebral cortex to affect speech processing before conscious awareness (brainstem) is unknown. By
recording neuroelectric brain activity to speech from brainstem and cortex, we show that MCI hypersensitizes the normal encod-
ing of speech information across the hearing brain. Deficient neural responses to speech (particularly those generated from the
brainstem)predictedthepresenceofMCIwithhighaccuracyandbeforebehavioraldeficits.Ourfindingsadvancetheneurological

 sessment, current clinical screens for cognitive impairments of-
ten suffer from high variability and poor test–retest reliability
(�50%) (Wollman and Prohovnik, 2003; Spencer et al., 2013).
To date, clinical interventions at early phases of cognitive decline
(MCI state) have produced mixed results (Petersen et al., 2005).
Advancing diagnostics and interventions for early cognitive im-
pairment requires that relevant biomarkers of cognitive deficits
are identified to detect individuals with early MCI before conver-
sion to more severe dementia (Golob et al., 2007) and also distin-
guish them from normal aging adults.
MCI-related changes in neuroelectric auditory cortical activ-
ity have been reported in several event-related potential (ERP)
studies (Golob and Starr, 2000; Golob et al., 2001; Golob et al.,
2007). However, cortical dysfunction might be anticipated given
the known atrophy (i.e., volumetric abnormalities) of cerebral
cortex that occurs in MCI and early forms of dementia (Kantarci
et al., 2009; Roberts and Knopman, 2013). To date, ERP studies
have also used relatively simple stimuli (e.g., clicks and tones) to
evaluate changes in auditory processing resulting from cognitive
decline (Golob et al., 2001; Irimajiri et al., 2005; Golob et al.,
2007). Arguably, these stimuli do not tax auditory system func-
tion—and potentially reveal neurological deficits—in the same
way as more ecologically relevant sounds (e.g., speech; Song et al.,
2006; Rocha-Muniz et al., 2014). Moreover, aging has been asso-
ciated with declines in listening skills necessary for communica-
tion (Gordon-Salant and Fitzgibbons, 1993; Hutka et al., 2013;
Bidelman et al., 2014a) that are exacerbated in cases of MCI
(Johnson and Lin, 2014; Petersen, 2014). Investigating speech
processing from brainstem to auditory cortex in adults with MCI
could reveal the earliest level of the brain at which cognitive de-
cline impairs neural function related to human communication.
Moreover, whereas disruptions to cortical function are well doc-
umented (Golob and Starr, 2000; Golob et al., 2001; Wollman
and Prohovnik, 2003; Golob et al., 2007; Bajo et al., 2010), the
possibility that MCI produces functional changes in subcortical
(brainstem) structures has yet to be established.
Inthecurrentstudy,werecordedneuroelectricactivityelicitedby
speech sounds from the auditory brainstem (i.e., frequency-following
responses, FFR) and cortex (ERPs) of normal-hearing older adults
who did or did not present with subtle MCI confirmed via behav-
ioral neuropsychological testing (Nasreddine et al., 2005). This
approach has been helpful in delineating the hierarchy of neural
events during speech perception (Bidelman et al., 2013) and has
revealed, for example, that normal aging produces differential
deficits in speech processing between subcortical and cortical
brain regions (Bidelman et al., 2014a; Bidelman and Alain, 2015).
Based on prior studies examining auditory ERPs in MCI (Golob
et al., 2001; Irimajiri et al., 2005; Golob et al., 2007), we expected
cortical speech responses to be weakened and delayed in individ-
uals showing cognitive impairments. In addition, based on our
prior work examining concurrent brainstem–cortical ERPs in
normal aging adults (Bidelman et al., 2014a; Bidelman and Alain,
2015), we predicted that MCI would be characterized by aberrant
brainstem speech representations beyond those exhibited purely
with advancing age. This novel approach also allowed us the
unique opportunity to evaluate for the first time the relative
power of brainstem versus cortical biomarkers in predicting the
severity of MCI as measured behaviorally. Our findings provide
novel evidence that MCI affects the neural capture and transfer of
speech signals between functional levels of the auditory system
and extends the pathophysiological understanding of cognitive
aging by identifying subcortical speech processing deficits with
MCI 7–10 ms after sounds enter the ear.
Materials and Methods
Participants. Twenty-three older adults (age range: 52–86 years; mean �
SD: 70.2 � 7.2 years) were recruited from the University of Toronto and
the greater Toronto area to participate in our ongoing studies of aging
and the auditory system (Hutka et al., 2013; Alain et al., 2014; Bidelman
et al., 2014a; Bidelman and Alain, 2015). Recruitment was aided by con-
tacting individuals listed in the Rotman Research Institute’s volunteer
research participant database, which contains �10,000 participants, half
of whom are over age 60. Participants were screened for cognitive func-
tion using normative data from the Montreal Cognitive Assessment
(MOCA) (Nasreddine et al., 2005). The MOCA was administrated in a
quiet room (the same room used for EEG recordings) by a trained re-
search assistant familiar with neuropsychological testing. Fifteen older
adults (8 male, 7 female) achieved normal MOCA scores (�26 points;
27.6 � 1.18; range: 26–30) (hereafter referred to as the control group).
Eight participants were identified as having putative MCI (4 male, 4
female) via scores of �26 (23.0 � 1.85; range: 20–25) on the MOCA
battery (hereafter referred to as the MCI group). Note that these scores
are well within the normative range for MCIs (19–25.2), but still well
above the MOCA cutoff for Alzheimer’s Disease or more severe dementia
(11.4–21) (Nasreddine et al., 2005). As expected, MOCA scores were
significantly lower in the MCI compared with control group (t(21) �
�6.95, p � 0.001). Because only behavioral measures were used to iden-
tify MCI individuals, underlying etiology was unknown.
All participants were strongly right-handed (Oldfield, 1971), reported
no known history of neurological or psychiatric illnesses, and were
matched in total years of formal education (MCI: 14.6 � 3.2 years, con-
trols: 17.4 � 3.75 years; t(21) � �1.68, p � 0.11). Musical training is
known to enhance and partially counteract age-related declines in the
neural encoding of speech at the brainstem and cortical levels (Bidelman
and Alain, 2015). Importantly, groups did not differ in the extent of their
formal musical training (MCI: 1.25 � 3.2 years, controls: 6.8 � 7.8 years;
t(21) � 1.91, p � 0.07).
Age-related hearing loss is also known to alter brainstem and cortical
auditory evoked potentials (Bidelman et al., 2014a). Audiometric testing
showed that hearing thresholds did not differ between groups at octave
frequencies between 250 and 4000 Hz (all p � 0.05), well beyond the
bandwidth of our stimuli. Moreover, in both groups, thresholds were
clinically normal (�25 dB HL) based on pure-tone average (PTA)
thresholds (i.e., average of 500, 1000, and 2000 Hz) bilaterally and did not
differ between groups (t(21) � 1.80, p � 0.09). No ear differences were
observed for either the MCI (t(14) � 0.25, p � 0.73) nor control group
(t(28) � 0.30, p � 0.77), indicating symmetrical hearing. Therefore, hear-
ing was well matched both within participants and between groups. Nev-
ertheless, we found it prudent to use listeners’ PTA as a covariate in
subsequent analysis to control for differences in hearing acuity that may
affect ERP/FFR analysis. The MCI group was on average �7 years older
than the control group (MCI: 74.6 � 3.3 years, range: 69–77; controls:
67.5 � 8.2 years, range: 52–86; t(21) � 2.34, p � 0.03). Therefore, age was
also used as a covariate in subsequent analyses. Participants were compen-
sated for their time and gave written informed consent in compliance with a
protocol approved by the Baycrest Centre research ethics committee.
Stimuli. A synthetic five-step vowel continuum (hereafter “vw1–5”)
was constructed so that each 100 ms token would differ minimally acous-
tically, yet be perceived categorically (Pisoni, 1973; Bidelman et al.,
2013). First formant (F1) frequency was varied parametrically over five
equal steps between 430 and 730 Hz, resulting in a stimulus set that
spanned a perceptual phonetic continuum from /u/ to /a/. All other
stimulus attributes (e.g., fundamental frequency, higher formants) were
identical between tokens (for further stimulus details, see Bidelman et al.,
2013). Categorical perception requires listeners to properly encode and
compare sensory representations to an internalized memory template for
speech and thus is likely to tax the auditory–cognitive system in ways that
other speech listening tasks may not (e.g., paired discrimination).
Electrophysiological recordings. Data acquisition and response evalua-
tion were similar to our previous reports (Bidelman et al., 2013, 2014a;
Bidelman and Alain, 2015). The task and EEG recordings were con-
ducted in an electroacoustically shielded chamber (Industrial Acoustics).

 Briefly, stimuli were delivered to both ears at an intensity of 83 dB SPL
through insert earphones (ER-3A; Etymotic Research). Extended
acoustic tubing (50 cm) was used to eliminate electromagnetic stim-
ulus artifact from contaminating neurophysiological responses (Ai-
ken and Picton, 2008; Campbell et al., 2012).
In one block of 200 active trials, we used a forced-choice procedure in
which participants indicated whether they heard “u” or “a” via a button
press on the keyboard. After participants’ behavioral response, the inter-
stimulus interval (ISI) was jittered randomly between 400 and 600 ms (20
ms steps, rectangular distribution) to avoid � entrainment of the EEG
(Luck, 2005) and listeners anticipating their behavioral response. An
additional block of 2000 passive trials (ISI � 150 ms) was then collected
to detect the submicrovolt brainstem FFR (Bidelman, 2014). Brainstem
activity is approximately an order of magnitude smaller than cortical
activity, so a larger number of sweeps is necessary to achieve a compara-
ble signal-to-noise ratio for FFRs as for the ERPs (Bidelman, 2015a).
Brainstem FFRs show robust repeatability within and across test sessions
(Song et al., 2011; Bidelman et al., 2017) and are unaffected by attention
(Picton et al., 1971; Hillyard and Picton, 1979; Galbraith and Kane,
1993). Therefore, participants watched a self-selected movie with subti-
tles during blocks of brainstem recordings to facilitate a calm yet wakeful
state. In total, the protocol lasted �2 h.
Continuous EEGs were recorded differentially between electrodes
placed on the high forehead at the hairline and linked mastoids. This
montage (�Fpz-A1/A2) is optimal for recording evoked responses of
both subcortical and cortical origin (Musacchia et al., 2008; Bidelman et
al., 2013; Bidelman, 2015a). Contact impedances were maintained below
3 k� throughout the duration of the experiment. Neuroelectric brain
activity was digitized at 20 kHz and band-pass filtered online between
0.05 and 3500 Hz (Symamps2; Neuroscan). Traces were then segmented
(cortical ERP: �100–600 ms; brainstem FFR: �40–210 ms), baselined
to the prestimulus interval, and subsequently averaged in the time do-
main to obtain waveforms for each condition (Delorme and Makeig,
2004). Trials exceeding a �50 �V threshold were rejected as blinks before
averaging. Grand average evoked responses were then band-pass filtered
in different frequency bands to emphasize brainstem (80–2500 Hz) and
cortical (1–30 Hz) neural activity, respectively (Musacchia et al., 2008;
Bidelman et al., 2013; Bidelman and Alain, 2015; Bidelman, 2015a).
Electrophysiological data analysis. Age-related changes in brainstem
and cortical responses are typically largest for amplitude rather than
latency characteristics of the ERPs (Alain and Woods, 1999; Golob et al.,
2007; Alain et al., 2012; Bidelman et al., 2014a). For data reduction pur-
poses and to provide comparable measures of response amplitude be-
tween brainstem and cortical ERP classes, for each stimulus, we
measured the RMS amplitude of the steady-state portion of the brains-
tem FFR (50–150 ms window) and the P1–N1–P2 magnitude of the
cortical ERPs. P1 was taken as the peak positivity between 45 and 65 ms,
N1 as the peak negativity between 70 and 120 ms, and P2 as the peak
positivity between 150 and 250 ms (Irimajiri et al., 2005; Bidelman et al.,
2014a). The overall magnitude of the N1–P2 complex, computed as the
voltage difference between the two individual waves, was used as a sin-
gular index of the total cortical activation to each vowel stimulus.
Whereas other FFR/ERP measures are available (Luck, 2005; Skoe and
Kraus, 2010), FFR RMS and cortical N1–P2 metrics are advantageous
because they both provide a description of the overall amplitude of the
evoked response at brainstem and cortical levels using an isomorphic
metric; their comparable unit of scale (microvolts) also ensures that mul-
tivariate discriminant analysis of neural responses was not artificially
skewed by using unrelated signal properties across levels (e.g., FFR spec-
tral vs ERP latency measures).
Behavioral data analysis. Individual vowel identification scores were
fit with a two-parameter sigmoid function. We used standard logistic
regression: p � 1/(1�e ��1(x � �0 )), where P is the proportion of trials
identified as a given vowel, x is the step number along the stimulus
continuum, and �0 and �1 are the location and slope of the logistics fit
estimated using nonlinear least-squares regression, respectively. Com-
paring the �1 slope parameter between groups allowed us to assess pos-
sible differences in the “steepness” (i.e., rate of change) of the categorical
speech boundary as a function of cognitive status. We have shown pre-
viously that normal aging weakens speech categorization skills, as re-
flected in shallower psychometric functions (Bidelman et al., 2014a;
Bidelman and Alain, 2015). Behavioral reaction times (RTs) were com-
puted separately for each participant as the mean response latency across
trials for a given speech token. Following our previous reports on cate-
gorical speech perception (Bidelman et al., 2013; Bidelman and Alain,
2015; Bidelman and Walker, 2017), RTs shorter than 200 ms or exceed-
ing 5500 ms were discarded as implausibly fast responses and lapses of
attention, respectively. These trials (�5% of trials) were excluded from
analysis. In addition to mean RTs, we computed the coefficient of varia-
tion (CV) of RTs (i.e., CV � SD/mean) for each participant per vowel
condition. Previous studies have shown that, even in the absence of sig-
nificant differences in central tendency, RTs can differ in terms of their
intrasubject variability (dispersion measured via CVs) (Bernstein et al.,
2014). Intraparticipant variability in behavioral RTs are also thought to in-
dex “neurological integrity” (Strauss et al., 2002) and have been shown to
distinguish older adults with and without dementia (Duchek et al., 2009).
Discriminant function analysis: predicting MCI via scalp ERPs. In addi-
tion to identifying potential changes in auditory processing within each
group and level of the auditory neuroaxis, we aimed to determine
whether brainstem and cortical activity could correctly classify listeners
into their respective group membership and thus predict MCI. To this
end, a linear discriminant analysis (LDA) was conducted to determine
whether a weighted combination of neural predictors (FFR RMS and
N1–P2 amplitudes) could discriminate control from MCI listeners based
on their ERPs alone. The LDA was developed at the group level with a
linear equation that was designed to classify listeners’ neural responses
into one of two mutually exclusive groups on the basis of their brainstem
and cortical ERP measures. Two neural measures per listener and speech
stimulus were input to the LDA (i.e., FFR RMS, N1–P2 amplitudes).
Because it is recommended that there be �40–50 observations for LDA
(Zavorka and Perrett, 2014), we used all 5 vowel responses for each
listener, resulting in a total of 115 observations (�5 vowels * 23 listeners)
submitted to the classifier. However, we note that classification results
did not differ depending on whether we collapsed across vowels (see
Results). Equality of the covariance matrices between predictors was con-
firmed using the Barlett test (p � 1.0) (Box, 1949), indicating appropri-
ateness of a linear (rather than quadratic) discriminant function. LDA
was implemented in MATLAB 2015b using the “fitdiscr” function using
prior probabilities of p � 0.50 (i.e., chance level for two group classes).
Classification performance of the resulting discriminant function was
determined by comparing the predicted group for each listener (based
solely on their ERP measures) against their ground truth actual group
identity based on their MOCA scores. This resulted in both a classifica-
tion accuracy and error rate that were then used to construct a “neural
confusion matrix.” Confusion matrices quantitatively indicate the de-
gree (percentage correct) to which the combined neural brainstem and
cortical ERP measures correctly classified listeners into the correct group
(i.e., “control” vs “MCI”). We further assessed generalizability of the
LDA predictions using k-fold cross-validation (where k � 10 folds). In
this procedure, the dataset is partitioned into k equal-sized subsamples
(folds). A single subsample of the k folds is retained as the validation data
for model testing; the remaining k � 1 subsamples are used as training
data. Because the number of to-be classified observations was 115, each
test portion of a single fold was 11 observations and the training portion
was 104 observations. k-fold cross-validation is advantageous because all
observations are used for both the training and validation of the classifier
model. For each subsample, the LDA function was recomputed and the
results averaged across all k-folds to arrive at a cross-validated estimate of
accuracy. Although cross-validated performance is typically lower than
unvalidated model performance, it helps to prevent overfitting.
Brain–behavior relationships. Pairwise Pearson’s correlations were
used to investigate correspondences between subcortical and cortical
speech representations (brainstem: RMS amplitude; cortical: N1–P2
magnitude) and MOCA scores. This analysis allowed us to determine the
degree to which brainstem and/or cortical speech encoding predicted
severity of MCI as measured via the MOCA.
Statistical analysis. Initial diagnostics confirmed that all dependent
variables satisfied the assumptions of parametric analysis (i.e., homoge-

 neity of variance, normality). Two-way, mixed-model ANOVAs were
first conducted on all dependent variables using SAS version 9.4 software.
Group (2 levels: MCI, control) functioned as the between-subjects factor;
vowel stimulus (5 levels: vw 1–5) as the within-subjects factor; partici-
pants nested within group served as a random factor. Initial analyses
indicated no main effect of vowel stimulus nor a group � vowel interac-
tion in neural measures (all p � 0.05). Therefore, we pooled this factor
(i.e., averaged across tokens) to reduce the dimensionality of the
ANOVAs and assess group effects directly on ERPs. We used age and
hearing (PTA) as covariates in the ANOVA models. Bonferroni correc-
tions were used to control type I error inflation for multiple comparisons.
Significance level was set at � � 0.05. All tests are two-tailed.
Results
Behavioral speech processing
While recording electrical brain activity, participants labeled
sounds drawn randomly from a set of five vowels that differed
only in first-formant frequency (Bidelman et al., 2013, 2014a).
Speech identification functions and labeling speeds (i.e., RT CV)
are shown in Figure 1, a and b, respectively. Despite the contin-
uous change in the acoustic signal, listeners heard a clear percep-
tual shift in the phonetic category (/u/ vs /a/) near the midpoint of
the vowel continuum (vw3). The overall location (�0 parameter:
t(21) � 0.65, p � 0.52) and slope (�1 parameter; t(21) � 0.68, p �
0.50 (Fig. 1a, inset) of the psychometric functions did not differ
between groups. However, these results might be expected given
that all listeners were native English speakers.
An ANOVA on RTs showed a sole main effect of stimulus
token (F(4,84) � 23.35, p � 0.001, �p
2 � 0.53) with no group
(F(1,18) � 0.00, p � 0.98, �p
2 � 0.00002) nor group � vowel
stimulus interaction (F(4,84) � 0.88, p � 0.48, �p
2 � 0.04) (data
not shown). Planned contrasts [i.e., mean(vw1, vw2, vw4, vw5)
vs vw3] revealed that participants in both groups were slower at
classifying speech tokens near the categorical boundary (vw3)
relative to others in the continuum (MCI: t(84) � 4.85, p � 0.001;
controls: t(84)� 8.93, p � 0.001). The slowing of RT for ambigu-
ous speech tokens is consistent with previous reports examining
speeded vowel classification and is a hallmark of categorical per-
ception (Pisoni and Tash, 1974; Bidelman et al., 2013). As with
the central tendency of RTs (i.e., mean RT), we did not find a
group difference in the CV (dispersion) of RTs, a measure of the
intrasubject variability of the behavioral decision process (F(1,18) �
0.06, p � 0.80, �p
2 � 0.003) (Fig. 1b). However, RTs were more
variable in both groups near the categorical boundary (vw 3)
relative to stimuli in the continuum (MCI: t(84) � 3.45, p � 0.002;
controls: t(84) � 4.80, p � 0.001). Collectively, these findings
suggest that both MCI and control listeners were able to ade-
quately categorize speech sounds and did so similarly in terms of
their speed, accuracy, and variability.
Neural correlates of speech representation
We recorded brainstem and cortical evoked potentials to speech
sounds using a novel electrophysiological paradigm that we re-
cently developed (Fig. 2) (Bidelman et al., 2013, 2014b; Bidelman
and Alain, 2015). Selective filtering techniques (Musacchia et al.,
2008; Bidelman et al., 2013, 2014a, 2014b) were used to extract
ERPs generated at both the subcortical and early cortical levels of
the auditory pathway for subsequent analysis and comparison
with behavior and MCI severity.
Brainstem FFRs
Speech-evoked brainstem FFRs and response spectra are shown
in Figure 3, a and b, for a subset of the speech stimuli. FFR wave-
forms were marked by a strong phase-locked neurophonic re-
flecting the periodicity of speech. Across all stimuli, average onset
latency of FFRs (first peak in the 8–15 ms time window) were
11.5 � 1.3 ms (MCI) and 11.2 � 0.9 ms (controls), consistent
with generators in the upper midbrain (Sohmer et al., 1977;
Bidelman, 2015b). Brainstem latencies did not differ between
groups (t(21) � 0.59, p � 0.56). As corroborated by lesion data
(Sohmer et al., 1977; Kiren et al., 1994), the latency (�7–10 ms)
(King et al., 2016) and high-frequency energy seen in FFR spectra
(Bidelman, 2015b) (e.g., components up to �1000 Hz; Fig. 3b)
rules out the possibility of a cochlear microphonic or cortical
contribution in FFRs; the preneural cochlear microphonic has
0 ms latency and is coincident with the stimulus onset (Batra et
al., 1986; Skoe and Kraus, 2010), whereas cortical evoked re-

Chauvel et al., 1994) and neurons in the Sylvian fissure are highly
restrictive (low-pass) in their upper phase-locking limit (�80–90
Hz) (Joris et al., 2004). We found that MCI listeners showed
larger FFRs than controls (Fig. 3a). MCI-related changes in sub-
cortical activity were particularly evident in response spectra,
which revealed hypersensitivity across the response bandwidth
(Fig. 3b).
These observations were confirmed via quantitative analysis.

 ilar at age 60 and 70 but differed at 80 years (Fig. 4e). These
findings indicate increased subcortical responses to speech in
low-MOCA performers, particularly in adults �80 years of age.
Recent studies suggest that FFRs to low-frequency (�100 Hz)
sounds may receive contributions from cortical generators (Cof-
fey et al., 2016). To confirm that FFR differences in the MCI
group were of brainstem origin, we averaged amplitudes of the
third through sixth harmonics (H3–H6; Fig. 3b) to evaluate neu-
ral speech coding at �300 Hz. These harmonics are several hun-
dred Hertz above the known phase-locking limit of cortical
neurons (Joris et al., 2004). Furthermore, FFRs from human
depth electrode recordings in Heschl’s gyrus are rarely observed
above �100 Hz (Brugge et al., 2009). As with FFR RMS ampli-
tudes, we found robust group differences at higher frequencies
(F(1,16) � 15.38, p � 0.0012, �p
2 � 0.34); MCI listeners showed
weaker phase locking to the upper harmonics (H3–H6) of speech
sounds relative to controls with a similar group � age interaction
(F(1,16) � 15.07, p � 0.0013, �p
2 � 0.33) as RMS amplitudes.
Given that cortical FFRs have not been observed above 200 Hz
(Brugge et al., 2009), the MCI group’s poorer responses at even
higher speech frequencies rules out the possibility that their ab-
errant FFR coding was due to cortical involvement and confirms
a processing deficiency of brainstem origin.
Cortical ERPs
Using nonspeech stimuli (e.g., tone pips), previous studies have
suggested that MCI is associated with increases in the P1 ampli-
tude (�50 ms) relative to the normal effects of aging (Golob et al.,
2007). However, using speech sounds, we found no effect of
group on P1 amplitudes (F(1,16) � 0.31, p � 0.59, �p
2 � 0.07) after
accounting for age and hearing thresholds. P1 amplitude is often
poorly defined (Godey et al., 2001), is strongly dependent on
neural synchrony, and is optimally elicited by transient stimuli
with abrupt onsets. This could account for the relatively weaker
P1 and lack of group differences that we found here for speech
(gradual voice onset time) compared with previous studies (e.g.,
tone pips; Golob et al., 2007).
Paralleling brainstem FFRs, we found larger cortical N1–P2 am-
plitudes in MCI listeners, particularly in the 100–200 ms time
window marked by the N1 and P2 deflections (Fig. 3c). Analysis
of N1–P2 amplitudes confirmed larger responses for the low-
MOCA (MCI) compared with high-MOCA (control) group
(F(1,16) � 10.96, p � 0.004, �p
2 � 0.34), even after adjusting for age
and hearing (Fig. 4b). However, the group � age interaction was
significant (F(1,16) � 10.41, p � 0.005, �p
2 � 0.33), meaning that
the magnitude of this group effect was again age dependent.
Whereas brainstem responses diverged between low- and high-
MOCA performers with advancing age, cortical responses con-
verged (Fig. 4f). Bonferroni-adjusted group contrasts at ages 60,
70, and 80 years revealed that this interaction was attributable to
larger N1–P2 responses in the younger divisions of our cohort
(MOCAhigh � MOCAlow; age 60–70 years), whereas cortical re-
sponses were similar in the oldest listeners (i.e., age 80: MOCAhigh �
MOCAlow). These findings suggest that increased cortical respon-
siveness to speech in low-MOCA scorers is more prevalent in
adults �70 years of age. A lengthening in the interpeak latency
between N1 and P2 may be indicative of a deficit at the cortical
level beyond general, age-related slowing. However, we found no
group differences (nor interactions) in interpeak latency between
the N1 and P2 waves (F(1,16) � 0.00, p � 0.97, �p
2 � 0.0001).
Importantly, these brainstem and cortical ERP effects were
absent when we compared a median split of the control group by
age (Fig. 5). Brainstem responses were more muted between the
youngest (n � 8) and oldest (n � 7) divisions of the control group
compared with MCI changes (Fig. 4) and did not reach signifi-

 cance (F(1,8) � 4.56, p � 0.07, �p
2 � 0.36) (Fig. 5a). Similarly,
cortical N1–P2 amplitude differences were indistinguishable be-
tween the youngest and oldest of the normal cognitive listeners of
our control sample (Fig. 5b) (F(1,8) � 0.14, p � 0.72, �p
2 � 0.015).
Null age effects were observed using both these parametric and
Friedman nonparametric statistical tests (i.e., two-way ANOVAs
conducted on ranked variables). The absence of any neural effects
in either brainstem FFRs or cortical ERPs further corroborates
our covariate analyses and suggests that MCI-related changes in
speech processing are not due exclusively to age alone.
Auditory biomarkers of MCI
Across speech tokens, it was evident that the control and MCI
groups were linearly separable based on either their brainstem or
cortical ERP responses; little overlap was observed in the distri-
butions for each group for either of these two neural measures
(Fig. 4c,d). High separability suggests that brainstem and cortical
ERPs to speech might be used as a biomarker to distinguish low-
from high-MOCA performers and thus identify listeners with
putative MCI based solely on their brain activity. To this end, we
conducted an LDA to evaluate whether group membership (con-
trol vs MCI) could be predicted by a linear combination of listen-
ers’ neural responses. For this analysis, we used all five vowel
responses for each listener, resulting in a total of 115 (5 vowels *
23 listeners) submitted to the classifier.
Figure 6 shows the outcome of the LDA classifier in which
each observation represents individuals’ brainstem/cortical re-
sponse amplitude for a single speech token. Overall, group mem-
bership was correctly predicted based on listeners’ FFRs/ERPs
with 80% accuracy (20% misclassification error, cross-validated),
which is markedly above chance level (50% of classifications were
expected to be correct by chance alone). Although the MOCA has
good sensitivity/specificity (90/87%) (Nasreddine et al., 2005),
our neural classification performance is considerably higher than
other clinical diagnostics for cognitive impairment (e.g., MMSE:
�50% Wollman and Prohovnik, 2003). On average, 68% of MCI
listeners were accurately classified as low-MOCA performers;
similarly, 88% of controls were correctly identified as high-
MOCA performers. Similar performance was observed even after
first collapsing (averaging) across the five vowel responses per
listener and classifying the 23 participants into one of two groups
(74% accuracy, cross-validated). Therefore, robust classification
of MCI from control listeners was achieved using either the indi-
vidual speech responses or a more global speech-processing mea-
sure, pooling responses across the vowel continuum.
Group classification was also well above chance when con-
sidering FFRs and ERPs alone in separate (single predictor
variable) LDAs. However, cross-validated accuracy was notably
higher in predicting group membership using brainstem re-
sponses (75.7%) compared with cortical ERPs (65.2%). Collec-
tively, our LDA results suggest that either brainstem or cortical
ERPs can distinguish normal from MCI listeners above chance
levels (the former being a better predictor), but the combination
of both neural measures yields up to �15% better classification.
Brain–behavior relations in predicting MOCA scores
Having established that combined brainstem and cortical speech-
evoked responses can distinguish MCI from controls, we next
aimed to determine whether neural measures were related to
MOCA scores (a continuous variable) and, if so, which level of
auditoryprocessing(i.e.,brainstemorcortex)wasmostpredictiveof
MCI severity. Correlations between listeners’ neural (brainstem
FFR, cortical ERP) responses and MOCA scores are shown in
Figure5.

control differences observed in FFRs, both brainstem (a) and cortical (b) responses were indis-
tinguishable when comparing the oldest and youngest of the cognitively normal listeners.
Absent effects in both brainstem and cortical ERPs confirms that the MCI-related changes that
we find in speech processing are not due to aging alone.

(r � �0.28, p � 0.19). These findings corroborate the LDA anal-
ysis and indicate that, whereas both brainstem and cortical
speech coding distinguish MCI from control individuals, subcor-
tical activity seems to more strongly predict mild cognitive de-
cline than cortical speech processing.
Discussion
Our findings indicate that MCI coincides with changes to the
neural representation of speech at multiple levels of the nervous
system. Notably, we demonstrate for the first time, that MCI is
associated with subcortical brainstem deficits in auditory pro-
cessing. Our results provide new insight into the neuropathology
of MCI by revealing subtle changes in how the nervous system
captures fine spectral details of sound that enables robust speech
identification. Collectively, our data provide evidence that, in
individuals with MCI, the early sensory transcription of speech is
altered at a subcortical level and there is a disproportionate in-
crease in cortical speech-evoked responses compared with nor-
mal aging adults.
Brainstem and cortical speech-evoked responses as a function
of age and MCI
MCI-related increase in brainstem and cortical speech-evoked
responses interacted with age, suggesting that the influence of
MCI on subcortical and cortical auditory–sensory processing is
age dependent. Interestingly, the pattern of these age-dependent
effects was reversed between brainstem and cortex. Brainstem
speech responses were abnormally large in MCI participants com-
pared with controls, which became even more prominent with ad-
vancing age (i.e., diverging effect). In MCI participants, cortical
overresponsivity was also observable in cortical evoked responses
(N1–P2). However, this effect became smaller (i.e., converged)
with advancing age. Nevertheless, MCI-related increased ampli-
tudes in both subcortical and cortical responses suggests diffuse
changes in auditory processing that occur concomitantly at mul-
tiple levels of the nervous system.
Both peripheral hearing loss and reduced cognitive flexibility
may contribute to the speech processing deficits that emerge late
in life (Humes et al., 2012). Although both groups had normal
audiometric thresholds and were equated for hearing acuity,
MCI-related changes in hierarchical processing are more difficult
to dissociate from those of normal aging. Despite accounting for
age in our analyses, MCI listeners were older than their peers.
Comparing present findings alongside our previous studies on
normal aging helps to further distinguish the effects of MCI
(present study) from pure aging (Bidelman et al., 2014a). We
have shown previously that normal aging produces differential
changes in the hierarchy of speech representations between
brainstem and cortex. However, in individuals with normal
cognitive function, we showed that aging in and of itself has a
surprisingly small effect on brainstem speech FFRs, whereas age-
related hearing loss (i.e., presbycusis) actually weakens subcorti-
cal neural responses (Bidelman et al., 2014a). This is in contrast to
both MCI-related deficits observed in the current study, which
showed an opposite pattern; stronger brainstem and cortical re-
sponses were observed in cognitively impaired listeners across the
board along with a differential pattern (i.e., age � MCI interac-
tion) between the FFRs and ERPs. This was further substantiated
in the present study when our data were split by median age,
which confirmed that MCI-related changes in speech processing
were not accounted for by age alone.
Although MCI listeners tended to show weaker perceptual
speech identification, we found no group difference at the behav-
ioral level either in terms of speed or accuracy, although there was
a tendency for higher intrasubject variability in MCI listeners’
speech-labeling speeds (Fig. 1b). This suggests that MCI is
associated with significant neurophysiological changes in the
auditory system that precede behavioral deficits and loss of com-
munication skills (Johnson and Lin, 2014; Petersen, 2014). Com-
munication deficits associated with MCI tend to involve complex
expressive and receptive language processing (e.g., verbal fluency,
reading comprehension; Johnson and Lin, 2014). The lack of
group effect observed here in categorical speech perception could
be due the simplistic nature of our identification task. Neverthe-

 less, our behavioral data underscore the limitation of using per-
ceptual measures alone in diagnostics. In this regard, the dual
brainstem–cortical ERP approach used here might provide a
“preclinical” biomarker of MCI before it manifests in traditional
clinical and neuropsychological assessments.
Our results can be interpreted in the context of the decline
compensation hypothesis (Wong et al., 2009) or the related
compensation-related utilization of neural circuit hypothesis
(Reuter-Lorenz and Cappell, 2008). Both frameworks posit that,
even at low task complexity levels, brain regions are overrecruited
in cognitive aging, reflecting neural processing inefficiencies far-
ther downstream. Under these interpretations, the minimal dif-
ferences we find in behavioral performance (Fig. 1) could result
from an overactivation of the speech network (Figs. 3, 4) as a
means to compensate for the pathophysiological declines of MCI
and maintain a computational output similar to cognitively nor-
mal individuals. Our results also align with dedifferentiation
frameworks (Li and Lindenberger, 1999), which suggest that age-
related impairments in cognitive function stem from reductions
in the fidelity of neural representations. In the present study, we
find lower fidelity neural speech representations in MCI individ-
uals at both the subcortical and cortical levels.
Predictive power of subcortical versus cortical ERPs in
predicting MCI severity
Previous studies showed normal or slightly larger responses of the
early cortical ERPs (e.g., P1) in patients with mild-to-moderate
Alzheimer’s disease relative to age-matched controls (Golob and
Starr, 2000). Moreover, recordings of the mismatch negativity
(MMN), a component reflecting early auditory change detection,
reveal greater MMN attenuation with slowing stimulus presenta-
tion rates in patients with dementia than in controls, indicative of
a faster decay of auditory sensory memory (Pekkonen et al.,
1994). These results, along with our present findings, indicate an
overresponsivity to auditory stimuli. The pervasive hypersensi-
tivity in neural coding suggests that MCI might be characterized
by early disinhibition resulting from prefrontal dysfunction via
efferent connections or abnormalities within the ascending audi-
tory pathways. Indeed, prefrontal dysfunction (e.g., lesions) have
been shown to enhance the amplitude of middle latency auditory
evoked potentials, which reflect early corticothalamic registra-
tion of sound (Knight et al., 1989). We extend previous studies
(Golob et al., 2007) by demonstrating that a hypersensitivity in
auditory coding extends before auditory cortex as low as the au-
ditory brainstem. Presumably, impaired transfer of information
between brainstem and cortex might be a precursor to declines in
speech reception and language skills often observed in MCI
(Johnson and Lin, 2014; Petersen, 2014).
To our knowledge, this is the first study to reveal that MCI is
associated with changes in subcortical auditory function. Previ-
ous electrophysiological studies investigating brainstem (click-
ABR) and middle latency responses in cases of MCI have reported
comparable responses compared with age-matched controls (Ir-
imajiri et al., 2005). However, MCI-related changes have been
observed in the latency/amplitude characteristics of the P1 and
later waves of the ERPs, leading to the view that primary auditory
cortex was the earliest level of the auditory system susceptible to
MCI-related neuropathology (Irimajiri et al., 2005). Our results
challenge this notion by showing clear evidence of MCI-related
changes in the brainstem’s transcription of speech sounds. This
was evident in FFRs by the increased (hypersensitive) coding
across the response’s spectrum. The FFR is thought to reflect a
neurophonic potential generated in the inferior colliculus (So-
hmer et al., 1977; Bidelman, 2015b), the onset of which corre-
sponds to the transmission delay from the ear to midbrain (i.e.,
�7–10 ms; King et al., 2016). Our data indicate that MCI is
associated with speech coding deficits as early as 10 ms after
sounds enter the ear, well before a listener becomes consciously
aware of the speech signal. Our findings bolster the notion that
speech-evoked brainstem FFRs might provide a sensitive index of
nascent changes in auditory neural processing that accompany
early MCI.
Current in vivo neuroimaging diagnostics (e.g., MRI, PET) are
promising in defining the neurology of MCI, but are costly, have
numerous contraindications (e.g., metal, claustrophobia), and
lack portability. Most also characterize anatomical, volumetric,
and metabolic abnormalities of the brain rather than functional
changes that underlie cognition proven to be more effective in
characterizing neurocognitive disorders (Sporns et al., 2004;
Hoeft et al., 2007). Auditory FFRs/ERPs provide a direct measure
of neuronal function and might provide a cost-effective alterna-
tive for assessing subtle changes in brain function in nascent
forms of dementia. Nevertheless, a limitation of our study is that
it only included behavioral measures to identify MCI individuals.
The underlying etiology was unknown. It would be important
in future work to establish links between our preliminary
brainstem–cortical electrophysiological indicators and other
prognostic biomarkers of dementia (e.g., hippocampal volume, �
amyloid proteins) (Cordell et al., 2013). Such studies could also
address several interesting questions regarding MCI’s time course;
for example, whether the brainstem dysfunctions observed here
precede hippocampal damage and/or the development of amy-
loid deposits.
Nevertheless, we found that dual brainstem–cortical ERPs of-
fered an overall accuracy of 80% in detecting MCI. This suggests
that early changes in auditory sensory coding, as indexed by
FFRs/ERPs, might complement behavioral measures by provid-
ing an objective measure for detecting early MCI and help to
discriminate early dementia from normal aging (Wollman and
Prohovnik, 2003; Spencer et al., 2013). Although we found that
both brainstem and cortical speech coding distinguished control
from MCI individuals (Fig. 6), subcortical activity more strongly
predicted mild cognitive decline than cortical speech processing
(Fig. 7).
Previous work suggests that the earliest components of the
cortical evoked potentials (e.g., P1 at �50 ms) might be especially
sensitive to MCI severity and predict the conversion to more
severe forms of dementia within a few years; that is, older adults
showing the largest cortical response amplitudes may have a
greater risk of converting to Alzheimer’s disease (Golob et al.,
2007). Our findings suggest that subcortical responses may pro-
vide an even more sensitive biomarker for predicting MCI sever-
ity than ERP components, which show comparably weaker
change (N1–P2) or do not yet show reliable changes (P1) in the
early MCI states examined here. Nonetheless, future studies
are needed to determine whether the brainstem and/or cortical
auditory electrophysiological markers observed here can detect
MCI in a larger sample and broader demographic. This latter
point is important in light of the fact that normative MOCA
scores can vary quite dramatically depending on listeners’ educa-
tional achievements and ethnicity (Nasreddine et al., 2012;
Narazaki et al., 2013). Future longitudinal studies are also needed
to determine whether brainstem speech FFRs also predict con-
version to Alzheimer’s or more severe dementia from the MCI
stages examined here. This is needed to extend our cross-
sectional results and demonstrate a causal connection between

 MCI and declining brainstem–cortical speech processing that is
suggested by these correlational data. Indeed, the involvement of
sensory regions extending as low as the brainstem may represent
early progression from an isolated episodic memory disorder
(amnesic MCI) to one affecting multiple perceptual–cognitive
systems (Golob et al., 2007), which impairs even preattentive
sound processing in the brainstem.
