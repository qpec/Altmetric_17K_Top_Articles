Mechanisms of chronic pain remain poorly understood. We tracked brain properties in subacute back pain patients longitudinally
for 3 years as they either recovered from or transitioned to chronic pain. Whole-brain comparisons indicated corticolimbic, but not
pain-related circuitry, white matter connections predisposed patients to chronic pain. Intra-corticolimbic white matter connectivity
analysis identified three segregated communities: dorsal medial prefrontal cortex–amygdala–accumbens, ventral medial prefrontal
cortex–amygdala, and orbitofrontal cortex–amygdala–hippocampus. Higher incidence of white matter and functional connections
within the dorsal medial prefrontal cortex–amygdala–accumbens circuit, as well as smaller amygdala volume, represented inde-
pendent risk factors, together accounting for 60% of the variance for pain persistence. Opioid gene polymorphisms and negative
mood contributed indirectly through corticolimbic anatomical factors, to risk for chronic pain. Our results imply that persistence of
chronic pain is predetermined by corticolimbic neuroanatomical factors.

 Introduction
Chronic pain is a state of continued negative emotional suf-
fering representing a leading source of worldwide disability
(Murray and Lopez, 2013) with a staggeringly high healthcare
cost (Medicine, 2011). Risk factors for developing chronic
pain remain poorly understood, yet its negative emotional
valence implicates the involvement of limbic circuitry. In
fact, both Maclean’s (1955) original formulation of the
limbic brain and Melzack and Casey’s (1968) concept of
the gate control theory of pain (Melzack and Wall, 1965)
hypothesized that the limbic brain plays an integral role in
pain states. Consistently, long-standing clinical evidence has
demonstrated that injury to limbic structures diminishes the
emotional overtones of pain (Raz, 2009). However, only
recent human neuroimaging (Apkarian et al., 2004; Baliki
et al., 2006, 2010, 2012; Geha et al., 2008; Hashmi et al.,
2013; Mansour et al., 2013; Mutso et al., 2014) and comple-
mentary animal model (Neugebauer et al., 2003; Metz et al.,
2009; Ji and Neugebauer, 2011; Ren et al., 2011; Mutso
et al., 2012; Baliki et al., 2014; Chang et al., 2014;
Schwartz et al., 2014) studies have begun to unravel the
role of limbic brain properties in chronic pain.
In the present study, we focus on intrinsic properties of the
corticolimbic portion of the mesocorticolimbic system. A net-
work comprised of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) (medial and
orbital cortices), nucleus accumbens, hippocampus/parahippo-
campus, and amygdala. Collectively, these structures support
emotion,
behaviour,
motivation
and
memory
functions.
Converging evidence reinforces the idea that components of
this circuitry are important for chronic pain. In humans, the
nucleus accumbens encodes salience of impending pain and
the reward value of analgesia, which is distorted in chronic
back pain (Baliki et al., 2010), and functional connectivity
between nucleus accumbens and medial PFC prospectively
predicts
chronification
of
pain
(Baliki
et
al.,
2012).
Prefrontal cortical activity reflects subjective reports of back
pain intensity in patients with chronic back pain (Baliki et al.,
2006; Hashmi et al., 2013) and is thought to regulate the
meaning of affective responses and influence emotional deci-
sion-making. Furthermore, the size of the amygdala and
hippocampus show strong genetic dependences (Hibar et al.,
2015) and both structures are implicated in emotional learn-
ing (Phelps and LeDoux, 2005), anxiety (Russo et al., 2012),
and stress regulation (Vachon-Presseau et al., 2013), and ex-
hibit changes in activity and functional connectivity during the
transition to chronic pain (Mutso et al., 2012; Hashmi et al.,
2013). Comparative evidence further bolsters corticolimbic in-
volvement in chronic pain by demonstrating that single
neuron morphology, excitability, and short- or long-term po-
tentiation are distorted within and across the hippocampus
(Ren
et
al.,
2011;
Mutso
et
al.,
2012),
amygdala
(Neugebauer et al., 2003; Ji and Neugebauer, 2011), nucleus
accumbens (Chang et al., 2014; Schwartz et al., 2014), and
PFC
(Metz
et
al.,
2009;
Ji
and
Neugebauer,
2011).
Consistently, the persistence of pain-like behaviours in rodents
is accompanied by a reorganization of resting state connect-
ivity primarily across limbic brain structures (Baliki et al.,
2014). Despite this compelling evidence, a comprehensive
examination of corticolimbic brain contributions to chronic
pain remains to be undertaken. Here we interrogate the func-
tional and anatomical properties of the corticolimbic neural
network, and its subcircuits, to unravel the interrelationships
between change in pain intensity, negative emotion, and their
potential genetic mediators. We report the novel finding that
anatomical characteristics of specific networks and structures
of the corticolimbic system predetermine risk for developing
chronic pain.

est parcellation schemes, pain and corticolimbic nodes, corti-

Participants
The data presented are from a longitudinal observational study
where we followed patients with subacute back pain (SBP) over 3
years. This report is based on the final total sample of patients.
Portions of the data were used in previous publications (Baliki
et al., 2012; Hashmi et al., 2013; Mansour et al., 2013; Petre
et al., 2015). The study recruited 159 patients with SBP and 29
healthy control subjects. All patients with SBP were diagnosed by
a clinician for back pain and reported pain intensity greater than
40/100
on
a
visual
analogue
scale
(VAS,
0–100,
where
100 = maximum imaginable pain and 0 = no pain) prior to en-
rolling in the study. Patients with SBP were recruited only if the
duration of their pain was between 4–16 weeks with no back
pain reported during the previous 12 months. Subjects were
excluded if they reported other chronic painful conditions, sys-
temic disease, psychiatric diseases, or history of head injuries.
Subjects were also excluded if they reported high depression,
which was defined as scores 419 using the Beck’s Depression
Inventory (BDI) (Beck et al., 1961). From these participants, 69
SBP (34 females, 43.1 � 10.4 years of age) and 20 healthy con-
trols (nine females, 37.4 � 7.5 years of age) completed the study
to 1-year follow-up. These patients with SBP were dichotomized
into groups with persisting pain (SBPp; n = 39) or recovery from
pain at the end of the year (with recovery operationalized as 20%
reduction in pain from Week 0 to Week 56; SBPr n = 30). A
subsample of 39 patients with SBP (18 females, 44.2 � 11.3
years of age) was followed for an additional visit at 3 years
from pain onset. Dates of visits are shown for all subjects in
Supplementary
Fig.
1.
The
Institutional
Review
Board
of
Northwestern University approved the study and all participants
signed a consent form.
Additional groups of patients and healthy controls were used
to cross-sectionally examine subcortical limbic volumes: 23
with chronic back pain (nine females, 46.6 � 6.0 years of
age), 40 osteoarthritis patients (22 females, 58.6 � 7.6 years
of age), and 20 healthy age-matched controls (10 females,
57.9 � 6.7 years of age).

 Pain characteristics, depressive
mood, and negative affect
Pain intensity was measured using the visual analogue scale
(VAS)
from
the
short
version
of
the
McGill
Pain
Questionnaire (Melzack, 1975) and disability was assessed
using the Pain Disability Index (PDI) measuring the degree at
which chronic pain disrupts aspects of the patients’ lives (Tait
et al., 1990). Negative affect was calculated with the negative
scale of the Positive and Negative Affectivity Scale (PANAS).
This scale consists of a series of items describing different emo-
tions experienced over the previous week (Watson and Clark,
1999). Depressive mood was assessed using BDI-1b. All ques-
tionnaires were given within an hour before brain scanning.
Summary results for pain characteristics, depressive mood and
negative affect are presented in Supplementary Table 1.
Scanning parameters
Anatomical (T1), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and functional
MRI were collected in the same scanning session. High-reso-
lution T1-anatomical brain images were acquired with a 3 T
Siemens Trio whole-body scanner with echo-planar imaging
capability using the standard radio-frequency head coil using
the following parameters: voxel size = 1 � 1 � 1 mm, repetition
time = 2.50 ms, echo time = 3.36 ms, flip angle = 9�, in-plane
matrix
resolution = 256 � 256;
160
slices,
field
of
view = 256mm.
Functional MRI images were acquired using the following
parameters: multi-slice T2*-weighted echo-planar images with
repetition time = 2.5 s, echo time = 30 ms, flip angle = 90�,
number of volumes = 244, slice thickness = 3 mm, in plane
resolution = 64 � 64. The 36 slices covered the whole brain
from the cerebellum to the vertex.
DTI
images
were
acquired
using
echo
planar
imaging
(72 � 2-mm
thick
axial
slices;
matrix
size = 128 � 128;
field of view = 256 � 256 mm2, resulting in a voxel size of
2 � 2 � 2 mm). Images had an isotropic distribution along 60
directions using a b-value of 1000 s/mm2. For each set of diffu-
sion-weighted data, eight volumes with no diffusion weighting
were acquired at equidistant points throughout the acquisition.
Morphometric analyses of subcortical
structures
Structural data were analysed with the standard automated
processing stream of FSL 4.1 that shows very high reliability
across labs (Nugent et al., 2013). The analysis entailed skull
extraction, a two-stage linear subcortical registration, and seg-
mentation
using
FMRIB’s
Integrated
Registration
and
Segmentation Tool (FIRST). The volumes of right and left nu-
cleus accumbens, amygdala, hippocampus, and thalamus were
calculated for each subject. Group comparisons were per-
formed using repeated analyses of covariance with volume as
the dependent factor, time of the scan and hemisphere as
within-subject factors, the group as a between-subject factor
(SBPp, SBPr, and healthy), and age, sex and total grey matter
volume [estimated using FSL SIENAX (Smith et al., 2002)] as
covariates
of
no
interest.
Post
hoc
comparisons
were
Bonferroni corrected for multiple comparisons.
From the initial 89 participants, nine were excluded because
T1 was missing or because of quality control failure of the T1
image at one of the four visits. Quality control included: (i)
visual inspection of the subcortical segmentation, where gross
mismatches between underlying anatomy and FIRST outcome
were excluded; and (ii) large deviations from the mean volume
of a given structure were also excluded [greater than �2
standard deviations (SD)]. Outliers were identified independ-
ently for hippocampus and amygdala volumes. From a total of
80 subjects, 11 were rejected from the amygdala analyses and
four
were
rejected
from
the
hippocampus
analyses.
Importantly, removing these individuals did not change the
overall statistical outcomes of our results. Our subsample of
patients scanned a fifth time at Week 156 included 33 patients
with accurate segmentation of subcortical structures.
Differences between SBPp and SBPr in amygdala and hippo-
campus volumes, initially discovered using FSL, were repli-
cated using the standard automated cortical and subcortical
segmentations
by
Freesurfer
5.0
(http://surfer.nmr.mgh.har
vard.edu/). The procedure includes motion correction, removal
of the skull using watershed/surface deformation procedure,
normalization in Talairach space, and segmentation of the sub-
cortical structures based on the existing atlas containing prob-
abilistic information on the location of structures (Fischl et al.,
2002).
As hippocampus and amygdala exhibited significant group
differences, we investigated whether these changes can be
attributed to localized structural deformations. Vertex repre-
sentation of both structures were therefore generated using
FIRST (Patenaude et al., 2011). The model uses a Bayesian
approach representing the structure in 3D from meshes fitting
the form of the subcortical structure to a training dataset that
was manually segmented. The shapes of the subcortical struc-
tures were represented from meshes parameterized by the co-
ordinates of their vertices. A multivariate permutation test on
the 3D coordinates of corresponding vertices provide the
F-values representing group differences (SBPp and SBPr).
Group differences in vertex localized at the boundary provided
a geometric change shape of the amygdala and the hippocam-
pus. No corrections for multiple comparisons were performed
on these analyses.
Diffusion tensor imaging
preprocessing
FAST (FMRIB Automated Segmentation Tool) was used to
segment the 3D T1 image of the brain into different tissue
types (grey matter, white matter, and CSF) while also correct-
ing for spatial intensity variations (Supplementary material).
For each subject, the grey matter and white matter masks
were transformed into standard space using FSL linear regis-
tration tool (FLIRT). Those masks were then thresholded
(probability 4 0.25) and multiplied with each other, yielding
a subject specific grey–white matter interface composed of re-
gions having relatively equal probabilities of being in either
category, thus constituting the grey–white matter boundary.
Probabilistic tractography of the whole brain networks were
constructed from voxels composing this grey–white matter
boundary.

 software. DTI data were manually checked for obvious arte-
facts. Eddy current correction was used and simple head
motion correction using affine registration to a no-diffusion
reference volume for each participant. Data were then skull
extracted (BET) and a diffusion tensor model was fit at each
voxel determining voxel-wise fractional anisotropy. Bayesian
Estimation of Diffusion Parameters Obtained using Sampling
Techniques
(BEDPOSTX)
and
probabilistic
tractography
(PROBTRACX) modelling two fibre tracks per voxel were
used to determine the probability of connection between re-
gions (Behrens et al., 2007). Voxel-wise principal diffusion
directions were used to repetitively compute a probabilistic
streamline from 5000 samples to generate posterior distribu-
tion on the ‘connectivity distribution’. Probabilistic tractogra-
phy was performed in the diffusion space of each participant
and then transformed to MNI space using FSL linear registra-
tion (FLIRT; Jenkinson et al., 2002). The connectivity distri-
bution was averaged across voxels of each of the 264 and 480
regions of interest (Supplementary Fig. 3) for whole brain net-
work
analyses
or
across
voxels
of
the
subsample
in
4 � 4 � 4 mm for the corticolimbic network analyses (1068
regions of interest; Supplementary Fig. 4). From the 89 par-
ticipants, 15 were excluded because DTI images were missing
at one of the four visits or because of quality control failure.
From the remaining 74 patients, two patients were further
excluded from the limbic network analyses because they
showed connectivity counts in the dorsal medial PFC–amyg-
dala–nucleus
accumbens

the

mean.
Diffusion scans were collected in 36 patients out of the sub-
sample of patients scanned a fifth time at Week 156.
Functional MRI preprocessing
Ten minutes of functional MRI were acquired at each visit of
the study, where subjects rated spontaneous fluctuations of
their pain. These data were used to examine intrinsic brain
connectivity differences between groups (SBPp and SBPr).
The preprocessing of each subject’s time series of functional
MRI
volumes
was
performed
using
the
FMRIB
Expert
Analysis Tool (FEAT). The sequence included skull extraction
using BET from FSL, slice time correction, and motion correc-
tion (Jenkinson et al., 2002). Temporal filtering between 0.01
and 0.1 Hz was applied on the blood oxygenation level-de-
pendent (BOLD) time series. The six parameters of head
motion, global mean signal measured over all voxels of the
brain, the signal from a ventricular region of interest, and
the signal from a region centred in the white matter were re-
gressed as covariates of no interest from the BOLD time series.
The first four volumes were removed for signal stabilization.
After preprocessing, functional scans were registered into a
standard MNI space using FSL FLIRT. From the 69 patients
that rated their spontaneous pain fluctuations, seven were
excluded because of missing functional scans at one of the
four visits. Our subsample of patients scanned a fifth time at
Week 156 included 34 patients with functional scans.
Construction of white matter
networks
Whole brain DTI-based connectivity networks for the 480 re-
gions
of
interest
for
SBPp
and
SBPr at
Week
0
were
constructed
using
methods
described
in
(Rubinov
and
Sporns, 2010). For all regions of interest, the connection prob-
ability between a seed region of interest and any target region
of interest in the brain is defined as the sum of sample fibre
lengths connecting these two regions of interest. For each sub-
ject, a 480 � 480 and a 264 � 264-weighted directed matrices
were generated from connection probabilities for all seed re-
gions of interest with the number of target regions of interest.
The resultant matrices were then symmetrized and adjusted for
distance constraints by multiplication with Euclidean distance
matrix. Finally, the matrix was thresholded at a value that
yielded a binary undirected network of different link densities
ranging from 0.02 to 0.20 (i.e. the top 2–20% of connections
were assigned a value of 1, whereas the rest of the connections
were assigned a value of 0; Supplementary Fig. 6). Group dif-
ferences (SBPp and SBPr) in edges connecting nodes of the
network were initially determined using permutation test con-
trolling for
family-wise
error rate using Network
Based
Statistics (NBS; Zalesky et al., 2010). Corticolimbic white
matter networks formed between 1068 � 1068 nodes were
generated for all subjects (SBPp, SBPr and healthy controls),
at each of the five visits using the same methods.
Construction of functional brain
networks
To construct the limbic functional connectivity networks for
each subject, we first computed the Pearson correlation coeffi-
cient (r) for the all possible pairs of the n = 1068 of cortical
and subcortical limbic regions of interest time series from the
preprocessed resting state functional MRI data. Similar to
white matter networks, threshold was calculated to produce
a fixed number of connections across link densities ranging
from 0.02 to 0.20 (top 2–20% of r-values binarized), for
each subject (Achard et al., 2012). The values of the threshold
are therefore subject-dependent but the number of connections
in the network is the same for every subject. The density of
structural connections was examined with respect to the com-
munity-based
organization
of
the
white
matter
network.
Therefore, group differences (SBPp and SBPr) in functional
connectivity within and across modules determined from
white matter tractography were tested using repeated measure
ANOVAs entering the visits as repeated variable.
Genetic association with mesolimbic
brain outcome measures
To test the idea that some of the mesolimbic brain properties
associated with risk of chronic pain may underlie a genetic pre-
disposition, we looked for associations between single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) and limbic brain properties. Saliva sam-
ples were collected from all subjects who completed the study.
Given the limited number of subjects in the study we decided to
only examine 30 SNPs. The choice of SNPs was determined prior
to having knowledge regarding the primary functional or ana-
tomical determinants of risk for chronic pain. The 30 candidate
SNPs located in 12 different genes were selected for their known
involvement in neurotransmitters, receptors and metabolites asso-
ciated with corticolimbic structures, and also for being related to
pain or nociception. Only one gene was selected as a marker for
peripheral encoding of nociception, SCN9A. A description of

 each gene is presented in Supplementary Table 8. Genetic analysis
was done independently and with no knowledge of the results of
brain analyses. Four brain outcome parameters were tested for
association with the 30 selected SNPs. SNPs that passed statistical
threshold (or were borderline significant) after Bonferroni mul-
tiple comparison correction were also tested for discrimination
between SBPp and SBPr.
Statistical analyses
Path analyses and multiple regression models
Path analysis was used to examine the direct and mediating
links between multiple variables to test a given theoretical
model empirically, specifically testing the prediction for SBP
grouping at Week 56 using a logistic regression model. Path
analyses were performed with Mplus 7.3 using the robust
weighted least squares estimator method accounting for the
non-normality of the data. We calculated 95% confidence
intervals for the indirect effect using a recommended bias-
corrected bootstrapped method (bootstrap of 1000 iterations;
Mackinnon et al., 2004); we rejected the null hypothesis when
the 95% confidence interval did not contain zero.
Results
This report presents the complete results of a longitudinal
study. Patients recruited while in subacute back pain were
followed over the course of 1 year (n = 69 patients with
SBP), with a smaller subset followed for 3 years (n = 39).
Thirty-nine patients with SBP were dichotomized into per-
sisting pain (SBPp) and 30 SBP were dichotomized into
recovery from pain as they showed 20% reduction in
pain intensity between Week 0 and Week 56 (SBPr).
Classification of patients with SBP at 3 years was also
based on the Week 56 criterion (SBPp n = 23, SBPr
n = 16). Group differences in pain intensity and disability
were observed as early as 8 weeks after entry into the study
and maintained temporal stability up to 3 years after back
pain onset (Fig. 1B). Over 3 years, no changes were
observed in negative psychological traits for SBPp or SBPr
(Supplementary Table 1), and medication use was not dif-
ferent between SBP groups (Supplementary Fig. 2).
Whole-brain white matter
connectivity
We used DTI probabilistic tractography-based structural
connectivity at study entry to identify brain areas for
which differences in white matter connectivity conferred
greater risk for chronic pain. The DTI scans at study
entry (10.8 � 5.5 weeks from onset of back pain) were
used
to
construct
whole-brain
structural
networks
(Supplementary Fig. 3) from different parcellation schemes
of 480 and 264 regions (Fig. 1C and Supplementary Fig.
6). Permutation tests were used to identify group differ-
ences in the incidence of connections, for each parcellation
scheme, across link densities ranging from 0.02 to 0.2.
Example
group
contrast
results
(SBPp 4 SBPr,
and
SBPr 4 SBPp; Supplementary Tables 3 and 4) for both par-
cellations, at 0.1 link density, are illustrated in Fig. 1D and
E. Connections were denser in SBPp and mostly localized
across corticolimbic nodes (Supplementary Tables 5 and 6).
In addition to corticolimbic nodes, we also identified nodes
related to pain perception using a term-based meta-analysis
tool (based on a map derived for ‘pain’ from 420 PubMed
publications; www.neurosynth.org). Group differences in
structural connections were localized outside pain-related
nodes. Instead, the likelihood for denser connections in
SBPp, compared to SBPr, was consistently higher within
the corticolimbic brain compared to random networks
(Fig. 1F and G). Collectively, these analyses indicate that
structural connections between regions involved in pain
processing were not involved in the development of chronic
pain. In contrast, denser white matter connections were
observed between nodes concentrated within the cortico-
limbic system, implying that these connections were more
likely to predispose individuals to transition to chronic
pain.
Corticolimbic modules contribute to
risk for chronic pain
The identification of dense corticolimbic white matter con-
nections does not provide information about underlying
anatomical and functional properties of this system that
may impart risk for chronic pain. Therefore, we next inter-
rogated the intrinsic structural and functional network
organization of the corticolimbic brain throughout the
3 years of observation, using higher spatial resolution
data. Anatomical networks were first constructed from con-
nections between 1068 nodes (4 � 4 � 4 mm voxels) be-
longing to the corticolimbic system (nucleus accumbens,
amygdala, hippocampus-parahippocampus, and the pre-
frontal cortex) (Fig. 2A and Supplementary Fig. 4). Edges
between the nodes were drawn from DTI-based probabil-
istic white matter tractography and from Pearson correl-
ations between functional MRI time series (i.e. functional
connections derived from functional MRI activity as pa-
tients rated back pain intensity). The structural (white
matter network) and functional (functional connectivity
network) graphs were constructed by binarizing the net-
works across different densities ranging from 0.02 to
0.20
(Supplementary
Fig.
6).
Derived
networks
were
tested and confirmed to be insensitive to standard con-
founds (Supplementary Fig. 5).
We first studied the architecture of the limbic white
matter network (Fig. 2A). This fine-grained, voxel-based,
intra-limbic probabilistic tractography-based white matter
network revealed dense, bilateral connections of subcortical
structures with each other and with the prefrontal cortex.
Modularity analysis revealed that this network was com-
posed of three distinct communities, including modules

 with the anatomical subdivisions of the amygdala, based on
meta-analytic functional co-activation maps of the amyg-
dala with the rest of the brain, which also show a close
correspondence to the region’s cytoarchitectonic subdiv-
isions (Bzdok et al., 2013) (Supplementary Fig. 8).
We next studied group differences and temporal variabil-
ity in density of intra-limbic white matter and functional
connectivity networks, both within and between the three
corticolimbic
circuits.
Although
white
matter
network
modular organization was common across SBPr, SBPp
and healthy individuals (Fig. 2C), SBPp consistently dis-
played a greater frequency of white matter connections
within the dorsal medial PFC–amygdala–nucleus accum-
bens module across all link densities (Fig. 2D), across the
four visits (Fig. 2E) and 3 years after pain onset (Fig. 2E).
The white matter networks of ventral medial PFC–amyg-
dala
and
orbitofrontal
cortex–amygdala–hippocampus
modules
did
not
differ
between
SBP
groups
(Supplementary Fig. 9A). The dorsal medial PFC–amyg-
dala–nucleus accumbens white matter network was stable
over 3 years because individual SBP values were strongly
correlated between Week 0 and Week 156 for all SBP (Fig.
2E). This finding is consistent with and generalizes from a
previous report that white matter regional fractional anisot-
ropy distinguishes between SBP groups (based on a sub-
sample of the current cohort; Mansour et al., 2013).
Examining the functional connectivity network connec-
tions in each one of the modules, defined in Fig. 2B,
showed that SBPp displayed higher incidence of connec-
tions
within the dorsal
medial PFC–amygdala–nucleus
accumbens module at all densities (Fig. 2F), at all four
visits (Fig. 2G), a finding that expands on our previous
report of stronger (seed-to-target) medial PFC–nucleus
accumbens functional connectivity in a subgroup of SBPp
(Baliki et al., 2012). However, the SBP group difference in
dorsal
medial
PFC–amygdala–nucleus
accumbens
func-
tional network connectivity was not maintained 3 years
later (Fig. 2G and Supplementary Fig. 10A and B), with
non-significant correlations between study entry and Week
156 (Fig. 2H). The functional connectivity networks of ven-
tral medial PFC–amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex–amyg-
dala–hippocampus modules did not differ between SBP
groups (Supplementary Fig. 9B). Taken together, these re-
sults reinforce that the functional connectivity within the
dorsal medial PFC–amygdala–nucleus accumbens is predict-
ive of the transition to chronic pain 1 year later; in con-
trast, its impact dissipates by Year 3, suggesting that it is
not required for the longer term maintenance of chronic
pain.
Amygdala, hippocampus and risk for
chronic pain
Morphometric measures of the amygdala and hippocampus
(Fig. 3A and B) were examined because they both show
strong genetic dependence (Hibar et al., 2015), represent
risk factors for developing pathological emotional states
such as anxiety (Russo et al., 2012) and depression
(Drevets et al., 2008), and previous studies suggest that
both may be involved in pain chronification (Metz et al.,
2009; Ji and Neugebauer, 2011; Baliki et al., 2012; Hashmi
et al., 2013). Given our white matter and functional con-
nectivity network findings, we also examined the volumes
of nucleus accumbens (a main component of the dorsal
medial PFC–amygdala–nucleus accumbens module) and
thalamus, as the latter is a primary relay for nociceptive
transmission to the cortex through the spinothalamocorti-
cal projections. SBPp exhibited �10% smaller amygdala
(Fig. 3C) and hippocampus (Fig. 3D) total volumes (left + -
right),
as
compared
to
SBPr
and
healthy
controls
(Supplementary Table 7). This effect was sustained over 3
years with strong correlations for volumes between study
entry to Week 156 for all SBP, for the amygdala and
hippocampus.
These
results
were
replicated
using
Freesurfer as an alternative segmentation tool for extracting
subcortical volumes (Supplementary Fig. 11). However, no
significant group differences were observed for volumes of
the nucleus accumbens or the thalamus. Exploratory ana-
lyses further revealed that smaller amygdala and hippocam-
pus volumes were accompanied by thinning of mainly the
right amygdala shape in SBPp at all visits (Fig. 3G). We
previously have shown that the hippocampus volume is
smaller
in patients with chronic pain (Mutso et al.,
2012). Here we replicate the finding in two new patient
groups suffering from longstanding chronic back pain and
osteoarthritis and show reduced volumes for both amyg-
dala and hippocampus. More importantly comparison be-
tween these groups and SBPp shows that extent of volume
decrease is similar across chronic pain patients and SBPp at
Week 0 (Fig. 3E and F). Given that both amygdala and
hippocampus volumes distinguished between SBP groups,
their morphologies did not change over 3 years, and smal-
ler amygdala and hippocampus volumes were comparable
between SBPp and multiple chronic pain conditions, these
volumetric measures (derived and validated using two un-
biased measurements, which are replicated in many labs in
more than 30 000 subjects; Hibar et al., 2015) most likely
reflect pre-existing circuit abnormalities that induce risk for
chronic pain, across multiple chronic pain conditions.
Genetic associations with limbic risk
factors
Data from twin studies show that chronic back pain is 20–
67% heritable (Ferreira et al., 2013). Given the recent
notion that genetic variants of some pathologies are more
penetrant
at
the
level
of
brain
measures
(Rose
and
Donohoe, 2013), we explored the hypothesis that gene vari-
ations can be linked to corticolimbic risk factors for chronic
pain. We used an imaging–genetics approach to examine
associations between SNPs and corticolimbic brain risk fac-
tors. In total, 30 candidate SNPs located in 12 different

 genes were selected for their known involvement in limbic
functions and also to pain or nociception (Supplementary
Tables 9–11). Genotypes were compared with regard to
amygdala and hippocampus volumes, and dorsal medial
PFC–amygdala–nucleus accumbens white matter and func-
tional connectivity network connectivity for Week 0 values.
Then, we secondarily tested if these genes could also
differentiate between SBP groups as identified at Week 56.
After correcting for multiple comparisons, the opioid recep-
tor delta 1 (OPRD1) rs678849 SNP was associated with
amygdala volume, and opioid receptor mu 1 (OPRM1)
rs1799971 SNP was associated with incidence of connec-

(Supplementary Fig. 12 and Supplementary Table 12).
These
findings
provide
suggestive
evidence
that
the
OPRD1 polymorphism is a genetic candidate for mediating
corticolimbic-based risk of chronic pain.
Modelling risk and symptom severity
for chronic pain
We performed path analysis to unravel the relationships
between the identified gene, pain at time of entry into the
study, and corticolimbic risk factors for predicting chronic
pain (Fig. 4). The three primary identified risk factors, each
of which predicted SBPp/r groupings at 1 year based on
measures collected at study entry, explained 60% of the
variance for pain chronification (the explained variance
would be closer to 90% if only right amygdala volume
was used in the model, yet the model using bilateral amyg-
dala volume should be more robust as this measure is
replicated using different segmentation tools), and the
gene–chronic pain relationship was fully mediated through
the indirect effect of the amygdala volume, accounting for
4% of the total variance (Fig. 4A).
Although back pain intensity measured at entry in the
study did not influence risk factor for chronic pain, it
was the only parameter of the risk factors that explained
30% and 38% of the variance in pain intensity at 1 year
and at 3 years, respectively (Fig. 4B). Restricting the regres-
sion model only to SBPp subjects, back pain at the time of
entry into the study was the only parameter that explained
76% and 51% of the variance of back pain at 1 year and 3
years, respectively. These results imply that although the
injury or inciting event-related back pain at time of entry
into the study does not influence SBP groupings, initial

corresponding volumes summed across hemispheres, and compared between groups as a function of time (Supplementary Tables 4 and 5). Heat maps

time effects; covariate for age, gender, and grey matter volume) revealed that SBPp showed smaller amygdala [F(2,63) = 7.94; P 5 0.001] and
hippocampus [F(2,70) = 6.35; P = 0.003], but no main effect of time (P-values 4 0.69) or group by time interaction (P-values4 0.23). Bar graphs

. *P 5 0.05 SBPp versus SBPr, and SBPp

osteoarthritis patients displayed at least marginally smaller amygdala [t(1,52) = 2.21; P = 0.03 two-sided unpaired t-tests] and hippocampus
[t(1,52) = 1.95; P = 0.057 two-sided unpaired t-tests] when compared to age matched healthy controls. *P 5 0.05, &P 5 0.06. (G) Vertex-wise shape

 back pain intensity has a large influence on symptom se-
verity, especially in subjects where the pain persists.
Influence of negative affect on risk
for chronic pain
Epidemiological studies indicate high prevalence of depres-
sion and negative affect in chronic pain patients, and pro-
pose these conditions reciprocally aggravate each other
(Gerrits et al., 2015). Our data showed that neither nega-
tive affect nor depression changed over 3 years in SBP
(Supplementary Table 1), which at least in this cohort dis-
counts the influence of the development of chronic pain on
negative moods. The converse influence of mood on the
development of chronic pain remains a possibility. We ad-
dressed this issue by testing whether depression, and nega-
tive affect, influence future pain outcome through the
mediating effects of uncovered corticolimbic risk factors,
using path analysis. We observed that the density of con-
nections
within
dorsal
medial
PFC–amygdala–nucleus
accumbens white matter network mediated an indirect
effect of depression on transition to chronic pain (account-
ing for 5% of total variance), with additional independent
contributions of the volume of bilateral total amygdala
volume
and
connections
within
dorsal
medial
PFC–
amygdala–nucleus accumbens functional connectivity net-
work (Supplementary Fig. 13). A similar mediation path
was observed for negative affect (Supplementary Fig. 13).
It is noteworthy that SBP were only mildly depressed, yet
their negative mood influenced pain chronification through
white matter connectivity of the medial dorsal PFC–amyg-
dala–nucleus accumbens module. Maladaptive genotype-
driven neural responsiveness may pave the way to develop-
ment of chronic pain. As the dorsal medial PFC–amygdala–
nucleus accumbens white matter network path is also influ-
enced by the OPRM1 rs1799971, we here uncover a
brain–gene relationship for the influence of mood on devel-
opment of chronic pain.
Discussion
The present study tested the role of the corticolimbic system
in development of chronic back pain. Earlier analyses of
subsamples of these data (Baliki et al., 2012; Mansour
et al., 2013) show that functional and white matter proper-
ties of some limbic regions impart risk for chronic pain. Yet
identification of these factors was based on whole-brain
contrasts. Here we used a completely unbiased approach,
with around double the number of subjects, and tracked
properties of identified risk factors for 3 years. Whole-brain
multi-resolution
white matter
network
comparisons
at
study entry indicated that structural connections predispos-
ing the development of chronic pain at 1 year were located
outside pain-related regions but within the corticolimbic
brain. Higher-resolution examination of the corticolimbic
white matter network identified three separate modules,
where
only
the
dorsal
medial
PFC–amygdala–nucleus
accumbens
module
differentiated
between
SBP
groups
based on both white matter and functional connectivity.
The white matter network connectivity of dorsal medial
PFC–amygdala–nucleus
accumbens
remained
constant
over 3 years, but its functional network connectivity dissi-
pated by 3 years relative to values at time 0. Both amyg-
dala and hippocampus volumes differentiated between SBP
groups, remained invariant over 3 years, and robustly dis-
tinguished between SBPp and SBPr.
The present results identify three segregated white matter
network connectivity-based corticolimbic circuits, with only
the dorsal medial PFC–amygdala–nucleus accumbens net-
work contributing to risk for chronic pain. What are the
functional properties of this module? The amygdala subdiv-
isions of each mesolimbic module show correspondence
with its function-based and cytoarchitecture-based parcella-
tion (Bzdok et al., 2013). The portion of the amygdala
incorporated within dorsal medial PFC–amygdala–nucleus
accumbens network matched best to the basolateral nu-
cleus, which functionally shows preferential involvement
in sensory input processing (Bzdok et al., 2013). On the
other hand, the corticolimbic circuits also subdivided the
prefrontal cortex into dorsal, ventral and orbital subdiv-
isions. These divisions may be viewed equivalent to the
Figure 4 Corticolimbic characteristics determine risk for
chronic pain but symptom severity depends only on initial
pain intensity. (A) Path analysis was used to identify the contri-
bution of rs678849 SNP, pain at Week 0, and brain parameters on
risk for developing chronic pain (SBPp/r at Week 56). The white
matter network (White matter) and functional connectivity net-
work (Functional) connections of dorsal medial PFC–amygdala–nu-
cleus accumbens (mPFCdorsal-amy-NAc) module and bilateral total
amygdala volume, at Week 0, were independent predictors of pain
persistence or recovery (SBPp/r) at Week 56 (all P-values 4 0.01).
The relationship between OPRD1 rs678849 and pain persistence/
recovery was fully mediated through the bilateral amygdala volume
(indirect pathway 95% confidence interval: �0.021 and �0.173;
R2 = 0.04 of unique variance). Covariance coverage within and be-
tween variables exceeded 88%. Numbers of subjects are shown in
parentheses. (B) Scatterplots show that pain intensity at Week 0
significantly correlated with pain intensity and pain disability at
Week 156 (P-values 4 0.001).

 rodent medial frontal cortex with respective correspond-
ences with pre-limbic, infra-limbic, and orbital cortices.
Within this perspective, the cortical component of the
dorsal medial PFC–amygdala–nucleus accumbens network
becomes analogous to the rodent pre-limbic cortex. In the
rodent, pre-limbic is necessary for expression of acquired
fear but not for innate fear (Corcoran and Quirk, 2007),
which parallels the evidence that human medial PFC repre-
sents intensity of chronic but not acute back pain (Hashmi
et al., 2013). In rodent models of persistent pain, pre-limbic
pyramidal neurons undergo rapid morphological changes
(Metz et al., 2009), and amygdala inputs shift the balance
between inhibitory and excitatory synaptic transmission in
pre-limbic neurons (Ji et al., 2010). Three recent independ-
ent studies now also show that activation of pre-limbic
neurons diminishes or blocks persistent, but do not influ-
ence acute pain behaviour (Lee et al., 2015; Wang et al.,
2015; Zhang et al., 2015). One of these reports also dem-
onstrates
that
projections
from
pre-limbic
to
nucleus
accumbens mediate the relief from persistent pain (Lee
et al., 2015). Therefore, the mesolimbic pre-limbic circuitry
and the control of persistent pain by pre-limbic activity
suggest
that
the
dorsal
medial
PFC–amygdala–nucleus
accumbens
module
should
be
considered
its
human
homologue.
We recently proposed that, from a behaviour selection
viewpoint, pain and negative emotions must be conceptua-
lized as a continuum of processes necessary for survival
(Baliki and Apkarian, 2015). Current results support the
idea by demonstrating that smaller amygdala and hippo-
campal volumes, parameters commonly associated with
negative affective disorders (Gilbertson et al., 2002), are
also predictive of pain chronification. In SBP, amygdala
and hippocampus volumes remained invariant over 3
years, and the reduced volumes seen in SBPp matched
those observed in patients with chronic pain. Thus, we
can generalize these results to chronic negative mood dis-
orders where we presume the observed decreased volumes
most likely also reflect predispositions. Recent evidence in-
dicates that amygdala and hippocampus volumes impact
emotional learning and sociability abilities. Healthy sub-
jects with larger amygdala volume perform better in fear
acquisition (Winkelmann et al., 2015), while subjects with
larger hippocampus show higher fear contingency aware-
ness (Cacciaglia et al., 2015) and more accurate discrimin-
ation of contextual fear (Pohlack et al., 2012). These limbic
volume-related differential response characteristics may,
therefore, represent personality traits predisposing subjects
to both chronic pain and negative mood disorders.
We observed that the OPRD1 rs678849 SNP mediated
through amygdala volume risk for chronic pain. Earlier
studies
associate
this
gene
with
cocaine,
opiate,
and
heroin addiction, as well as with smaller regional brain
volume
(http://www.snpedia.com/index.php/Rs678849).
This genetic evidence is consistent and complimentary to
the role of dorsal medial PFC–amygdala–nucleus accum-
bens module in determining risk for chronic pain, as the
latter module is also commonly implicated in addictive
pathologies.
Collectively
these
observations
argue
for
chronic pain being a maladaptive response, contingent on
corticolimbic properties that render the brain addicted to
pain. We, however, emphasize the important caveat that
the gene–brain–behaviour associations illustrated here are
based on sampling few SNPs in a small number of subjects.
They must be viewed as proof-of-concept exemplars, and
larger and multi-centred collaborative gene–brain studies
are necessary to unravel genes critical in the transition to
chronic pain.
In conclusion, these results challenge long-standing views
of the science of pain. Traditionally, the field has empha-
sized the inciting injury and related nociceptive spinal pro-
cesses as primary culprits of pain chronification. Instead,
here we establish that the gross anatomical properties of
the corticolimbic brain, not the initial back pain, determine
most of the risk for developing chronic pain. As the ana-
tomical risk factors were stable across 3 years, they were
presumably hardwired and present prior to the event initi-
ating back pain. These results pave the way for the devel-
opment of novel and distinct approaches to prevention and
treatment of chronic pain.
