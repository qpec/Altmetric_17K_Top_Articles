Abstract
Background: Persistent use of real-time continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) improves diabetes control in
individuals with type 1 diabetes (T1D) and type 2 diabetes (T2D).
Methods: PRECISE II was a nonrandomized, blinded, prospective, single-arm, multicenter study that evaluated
the accuracy and safety of the implantable Eversense CGM system among adult participants with T1D and T2D
(NCT02647905). The primary endpoint was the mean absolute relative difference (MARD) between paired
Eversense and Yellow Springs Instrument (YSI) reference measurements through 90 days postinsertion for
reference glucose values from 40 to 400 mg/dL. Additional endpoints included Clarke Error Grid analysis and
sensor longevity. The primary safety endpoint was the incidence of device-related or sensor insertion/removal
procedure-related serious adverse events (SAEs) through 90 days postinsertion.
Results: Ninety participants received the CGM system. The overall MARD value against reference glucose
values was 8.8% (95% confidence interval: 8.1%–9.3%), which was significantly lower than the prespecified
20% performance goal for accuracy (P < 0.0001). Ninety-three percent of CGM values were within 20/20% of
reference values over the total glucose range of 40–400 mg/dL. Clarke Error Grid analysis showed 99.3% of
samples in the clinically acceptable error zones A (92.8%) and B (6.5%). Ninety-one percent of sensors were
functional through day 90. One related SAE (1.1%) occurred during the study for removal of a sensor.
Conclusions: The PRECISE II trial demonstrated that the Eversense CGM system provided accurate glucose
readings through the intended 90-day sensor life with a favorable safety profile.

Introduction
N
umerous studies have shown that use of real-time
continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) improves gly-
cemic control1–6 and quality of life7 in individuals with type 1
diabetes (T1D) and type 2 diabetes (T2D).8 The clinical
benefits of CGM technology are maximized in patients who
regularly wear their CGM devices for at least 6 days per
week1–3,5,6,9,10; however, many patients struggle to achieve
consistent adherence.9,10 Moreover, many individuals who

 initiate CGM frequently discontinue its use. A recent survey
of individuals who initiated CGM in the T1D Exchange
registry found that 41% of patients discontinued use during
the first year.11 Common reasons cited for discontinuation
included discomfort wearing the sensor (42%), trouble in-
serting the sensor (33%), problems with adhesive securing
sensor to skin (30%), challenges with the device working
properly (28%), skin reactions to the sensor adhesive (18%),
and interference with playing sports and activities (18%).
A novel implantable subcutaneous CGM system (Ever-
sense CGM system; Senseonics, Inc., Germantown, MD)12–14
was designed to address several of the limitations of use of
current CGM systems. The Eversense sensor is designed
to operate for 90 days, which is intended to reduce the in-
convenience and discomfort of weekly sensor insertions.
The Eversense smart transmitter is worn over the sensor and
wirelessly powers it to initiate the glucose measurement and
the transfer of data to a Mobile Medical Application
(MMA). The transmitter can be removed at any time
without the need for sensor replacement, allowing greater
convenience and lifestyle flexibility. In addition, hypogly-
cemic and hyperglycemic alerts and notifications are pro-
vided on a mobile device as well as on on-body vibratory
alerts from the transmitter even when the mobile device is
not nearby.
The Eversense CGM system has been evaluated in two
prior published studies. A feasibility study of 12 participants
with T1D found no evidence of nighttime sensor attenua-
tion,15 which has been reported in transcutaneous sen-
sors.16,17 The system was also evaluated in the multicenter
European 180-day PRECISE pivotal study, which demon-
strated that use of the CGM device provided improved gly-
cemic control in 71 participants with T1D or T2D. The
PRECISE study also established the accuracy against refer-
ence venous glucose values 40–400 mg/dL with a mean ab-
solute relative difference (MARD) of 11.6%,18 which is
comparable with other commercially available CGM sys-
tems.19 The data from the PRECISE trial were used as a
training set to further improve the glucose calibration and
calculation algorithm used within the system. Specifically,
the algorithm was modified to improve the finger-stick cali-
bration methodology and to account for differential physio-
logical lag considerations.
In this report, we present findings from PRECISE II, a
multicenter U.S. pivotal trial that evaluated the accuracy and
safety of an updated Eversense system, which included a
modified algorithm and a new sensor configuration, in indi-
viduals with T1D and T2D.
Methods
Study design and participants
PRECISE II was a 90-day, nonrandomized, prospective,
blinded, single-arm multicenter study of the Eversense CGM
system among adult participants with T1D and T2D. The
study was conducted from January 2016 to July of 2016 at
eight sites in the United States. The study enrolled individuals
who were ‡18 years and had a clinically confirmed diagnosis
of T1D or T2D for at least 1 year. Individuals were excluded
from participation if they had any of the following: a history
of severe hypoglycemia or diabetic ketoacidosis, requiring an
emergency room visit or hospitalization during the previous
6 months; a condition preventing or complicating sensor
placement, operation, or removal; symptomatic coronary ar-
tery disease, unstable angina, myocardial infarction, or stroke
in the past 6 months before study; uncontrolled hypertension;
hematocrit <30% or >50%; lactation, pregnancy, or intending
to become pregnant during the course of the study; presence of
other active implanted devices; or a condition likely to require
magnetic resonance imaging for the duration of the study.
The study was performed in accordance with the Dec-
laration of Helsinki and was approved by a centralized in-
ternal review board. Written and verbal informed consent
was obtained from all participants.
Study device
The CGM system consists of an implantable, fluorescence-
based, cylindrical glucose sensor (3.5 · 18.3 mm); a smart
transmitter; and a MMA that displays glucose information
and operates on a mobile device, which allows users to re-
view current and historical glucose data in real time.
The sensor contains core electronics and optics that are
sealed in epoxy within a polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA)
encasement (Fig. 1). The sensor is activated to measure in-
terstitial fluid glucose every 5 min when it receives radio
frequency power from the transmitter. A 100-lm thick co-
polymer matrix is grafted to the outside of the PMMA en-
casement. This embedded polymer, the indicator hydrogel, is
fluorescent and uses selective, fully reversible binding be-
tween glucose and the covalently attached molecular com-
plex to detect changes in glucose concentrations. Glucose
binding results in an increase in fluorescence intensity, which
is measured by the sensor’s optical system. The optical sys-
tem contained within the PMMA encasement includes an
LED and two photodiodes, powered by a ferrite antenna
substrate. These act as a miniaturized spectrofluorometer to
measure the generated fluorescent intensity. The encoded
data are sent to the transmitter and this information is then
used to produce a glucose reading and to check the integrity
of the system. The sensor has a silicone collar impregnated
with a small amount (1.75 mg) of dexamethasone acetate that
elutes an average of 3 lg per day over the life of the sensor to
attenuate the body’s local inflammatory response and prolong
the sensor life. The system is designed to provide a sensor
replacement alert to the user when it reaches insufficient
sensitivity to glucose due to oxidative degradation of the
glucose recognition chemistry.20 This design element is in-
cluded to maintain the high degree of system accuracy
throughout the entire sensor life.
The battery-powered transmitter (1.5 by 1.7 inches; 0.6
inches thick) is worn externally over the sensor and transfers
glucose data to the MMA every 5 min through a secured low-
energy bluetooth transmission. The transmitter also provides
on-body vibrations that alert users of immediate and im-
pending hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia. The transmitter is
rechargeable and takes *15 min about every other day to
fully charge.
Procedures
The study consisted of seven clinic visits: a screening visit,
a sensor insertion visit, four accuracy assessment visits (days
1, 30, 60, and 90), and a postsensor removal follow-up visit.
198
CHRISTIANSEN ET AL.
 During the screening visit, participant demographic data and
medical history were recorded and laboratory measurements
(i.e., hemoglobin A1c [HbA1c], hematocrit, and plasma
dexamethasone), a physical examination, and an electrocar-
diogram were performed. Female participants also had urine
pregnancy testing. Sensor insertion sites, adverse events, he-
matocrit levels, pregnancy, and changes in medications and
insulin therapy were assessed and findings recorded at all
subsequent visits. HbA1c and plasma dexamethasone levels
were assessed at the day 90 visit also.
Endocrinology specialists without surgical training (i.e.,
physicians, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants) in-
serted all sensors in the upper arm at the sensor insertion visit
(day 0). The sensor insertion procedure is shown schemati-
cally in Figure 2. Most participants had one sensor inserted. A
prespecified subset of 15 participants had bilateral sensors
placed to assess intrapatient variability and the effect of
compression of the system such as would occur during sleep.
After insertion, the sensor requires a 24-h warm-up phase
after which the participant is prompted to begin calibration.
The study-issued self-monitoring blood glucose (SMBG)
meter and test strips used for calibrations were CONTOUR�
NEXT USB and CONTOUR NEXT blood glucose test strips
(Ascensia Diabetes Care, Parsippany, NJ). Participants were
asked to wear the transmitter(s) over the sensor(s) and to
perform calibration twice daily. Data from the SMBG meter
were collected at each follow-up visit. The CGM values and
all glucose-related alerts were blinded to both the participants
and investigators for the duration of the study. All diabetes
care decisions were based on blood glucose meter values and
clinical standards of care.
The accuracy of the system was evaluated during clinic
visits on days 1, 30, 60, and 90 by comparing the glucose
values measured by the CGM with those measured by a
bedside glucose analyzer (2300 Stat Plus Glucose and Lactate
Analyzer; Yellow Springs Instruments [YSI], Yellow Springs,
OH). Qualifying participants (i.e., individuals on insulin and
without gastroparesis) underwent hyperglycemia and hypo-
glycemia challenges on days 30, 60, and 90. The intent of the
challenges was to safely manipulate the participant’s blood

 glucose level using fasting and insulin dosing or meals of
known carbohydrate content so that sensor performance could
be evaluated over a wider range than might otherwise be ob-
served. Other than during glucose challenges, participants
were allowed to eat, drink, and continue their diabetes treat-
ment regimen throughout the visits. The effect of compression
was evaluated in participants with bilateral sensors by having
the participant lie on one side for a period of 30 min. The effect
of exercise was evaluated in participants with a single sensor
who performed 30min of upper arm exercises with barbells
using the arm with the inserted sensor.
Blood samples were drawn between 7 am and 9 pm for a
4.5-h period on day 1 (venous reference measurements began
after the second calibration was entered when CGM values
are first available) and for a 12.5-h period on days 30, 60, and
90. Blood samples were drawn every 5–15 min, depending on
the participant’s blood glucose level (every 15 min for blood
glucose ‡75 mg/dL, every 5 min for blood glucose <75 mg/
dL). Samples were drawn every 5 min during the periods of
arm exercise and compression. Each YSI blood glucose
measurement was paired to the corresponding CGM mea-
surement obtained within 5 min of the blood draw.
After the accuracy assessment at the day 90 clinic visit,
venous blood samples were obtained for HbA1c and dexa-
methasone levels, and the sensors were removed. Ten days
after removal (day 100), participants returned for follow-up
and the insertion site was inspected.
Outcome measures
The primary effectiveness endpoint was the MARD
for paired sensor and YSI reference glucose measurements
collected during the clinic visits through 90 days postinser-
tion across a glucose range of 40–400 mg/dL. Additional
endpoints included Clarke Error Grid analysis21; sensor

 longevity; accuracy of rate of change (ROC); accuracy dur-
ing compression and exercise; accuracy during hypoglyce-
mic, euglycemic, and hyperglycemic states; accuracy by
study visit; transmitter wear time; and alert performance.
Accuracy of ROC was calculated based on linear regression
of CGM in the past 15 min.
The accuracy of the CGM system to provide alerts to hy-
poglycemic (<70 mg/dL) and hyperglycemic (>180 mg/dL)
events was determined using several measures in a retro-
spective manner since participants were blinded to alerts
throughout the study. The ‘‘true alert rate’’ was calculated as
the number of device alerts confirmed by YSI (the glucose
level had to meet the definition of hypoglycemia or hy-
perglycemia within 15 min before or after an alert) divided
by the number of total device alerts. The ‘‘false alert rate’’
was calculated as the number of device alerts not con-
firmed by YSI divided by the number of total device alerts.
The ‘‘confirmed event detection rate’’ was calculated as the
number of hypoglycemic or hyperglycemic events per YSI
measurement that were detected by the device divided by the
total number of hypoglycemic or hyperglycemic events. The
‘‘missed event detection rate’’ was calculated as the number
of hypoglycemic or hyperglycemic events per YSI mea-
surement that were not detected by the device divided by the
number of hypoglycemic or hyperglycemic events.
The primary safety endpoint was the incidence of device-
related or sensor insertion/removal procedure-related serious
adverse events (SAEs) through 10 days postremoval. An
independent medical monitor adjudicated all reported ad-
verse events for relatedness to the device, sensor insertion/
removal procedure, and study procedure (e.g., hyperglycemia
and hypoglycemia challenges).
Statistical methods
The prespecified analysis population for the primary ef-
fectiveness endpoint and additional endpoints was based on
all evaluable glucose data from all participants with at least
one paired glucose reading excluding training participants
(the first participant at each site). A post hoc exploratory
analysis was based on all evaluable data with at least one
paired glucose reading including training participants. The
safety analysis population included all participants who had a
sensor placed.
The primary effectiveness endpoint was evaluated against
a prespecified 20% performance goal using a generalized es-
timating equation with an exchangeable working correlation
structure. Sensor longevity was evaluated using Kaplan–Meier
analysis. A concordance analysis of the ROC in CGM and in
YSI glucose was performed with each type of ROC grouped
into five categories of glucose change [mg/(dL$min)]. All
other effectiveness analyses were evaluated using descriptive
statistics.
The proportion of participants experiencing at least one
device-related or insertion/removal procedure-related SAE
over the operating life of the sensor was determined along
with the associated 95% confidence interval (CI).
Results
Ninety participants (n = 75 single sensor and n = 15 bilat-
eral sensors) were inserted with the sensor and are included in
the primary effectiveness and safety populations. One hun-
dred six sensors were placed in the study (75 single sensor
participants, 15 bilateral dual sensor participants, and 1 par-
ticipant who received a replacement sensor due to a suspected

 technical device failure). The first participant at each clinical
site (n = 8) was considered a training participant. Eighty-two
participants (91%) completed the study with day 90 data
collection. Five participants experienced a sensor replace-
ment alert before day 90, which ended glucose data col-
lection. Two participants withdrew consent (one for being
unable to tolerate intravenous access for in-clinic accuracy
testing and one for scheduling difficulties). One participant
was lost to follow-up; after completion of the study, the
participant was located and the sensor was removed. Parti-
cipant baseline characteristics are presented in Table 1.
Figure 3 displays the cumulative frequency of transmitter
use per day for all participants through sensor retirement or
90 days after sensor insertion. The frequency graph shows
that the median transmitter wear time for the participants was
23.4 hours per day.
Effectiveness outcomes
The primary effectiveness endpoint of MARD over
the glucose range of 40–400 mg/dL was 8.8% (95% CI:
8.1%–9.3%) for the prespecified analysis population, which
included the 82 participants who were not training partici-
pants and 16,653 matched glucose measurements (Table 2).
Analysis showed that 93.3% of CGM values were within
–20 mg/dL or 20% of YSI reference values (referred to as
20/20%) over the total YSI glucose range of 40–400 mg/dL.
The system showed accuracy and stability across all clinic
visits with a high percentage of CGM values within 20/20%
of reference values (Table 3). Similar results on the primary
effectiveness endpoint were observed in the post hoc anal-
ysis of all 90 participants (18,261 matched glucose mea-
surements) with an MARD of 8.9% (95% CI: 8.3%–9.4%);
93% of CGM values were within 20/20% of reference values.
A representative example of an in-clinic session occurring
with YSI reference points illustrating the meal challenge ex-
cursions along with the continuous measurements from the
sensor system is presented in Figure 4.
Table 4 provides the results on the effect of compression
on accuracy. There was no significant difference in the per-
centage of CGM readings within 20/20% of the reference
values for readings taken during compression (92.3%) or no
compression (93.4%) conditions (P = 0.88). Table 5 provides
the results on the effect of exercise on accuracy. No signifi-
cant difference was observed in the percentage of CGM
readings within 20/20% of the reference values between
the exercise (95.1%) and nonexercise (93.2%) conditions
(P = 0.35). Data obtained during the compression challenges

In-clinic accuracy is assessed compared with venous YSI reference measurement. The effect of compression on accuracy was evaluated
by instructing participants with bilaterally placed sensors to lie on one side for 30 min. Results compared with the noncompressed side are
reported. The percentage of system readings within –15 mg/dL or 15% of YSI reference values (15/15%), –20 mg/dL or 20% of YSI

 did not indicate that the sensor signal was susceptible to the
nighttime sensor attenuation phenomenon that is an issue
with transcutaneous CGM sensors.16,17
The clinical performance of the CGM system estimated
per Clarke Error Grid analysis showed 99.3% of samples in
the clinically acceptable error zones A (92.8%) and B (6.5%),
none in zones C and E, and 0.7% in zone D (Fig. 5).
Among the 15 participants who had bilateral sensor im-
plantations, there were a total of 9974 matched pairs. Analysis
demonstrated a strong correlation between sensorswith a paired
absolute relative difference of 8.8% (95% CI: 7.4%–12.3%).
The system remained accurate across all glucose ROC
categories. The highest agreement with YSI glucose values
was observed during the lowest CGM system absolute ROC
(Table 6). CGM and YSI concordance by ROC is summa-
rized in Table 7.
In cases wherein CGM and YSI were discordant, they were
usually only one category away from the main diagonal. Only
2.4% (376 pairs) of the available pairs were more than one
category away from the main diagonal for the system-
reported ROC.
The ability of the system to identify hypoglycemic and
hyperglycemic events showed a relatively high degree of
performance. The system correctly identified 93% and 96%
of hypoglycemic and hyperglycemic events per YSI. When a
hypoglycemic or hyperglycemic event was detected by the
device, the system determination was in agreement with YSI
in 86% and 94% of cases, respectively (Table 8).
The sensor survival probability at day 90 for the 106 im-
planted sensors was 91% based on Kaplan–Meier analysis
(Fig. 6). For the sensors that retired before day 90, one of the
sensors that triggered a retirement alert was due to a com-
promised electrical connection in the sensors optics. This
sensor was replaced, per protocol, since it occurred within
30 days of insertion. All other early sensor retirements were
due to the sensor reaching insufficient sensitivity to glucose
from degradation of the binding chemistry as described by
Colvin and Jiang.20
Safety outcomes
During the study, there were a total of 14 adverse events
among seven participants that were adjudicated as either re-
lated or possibly related to the device or insertion/removal
procedures. Two events were classified as moderate in se-
verity and 12 events were classified as mild. Nine events were
bruising, erythema, or pain/discomfort; eight of these events
were considered mild in severity and one instance of arm pain

 was of moderate severity. One syncopal episode after inser-
tion of the device and one episode of paresthesia or tingling
were reported: both were rated mild in severity. There were
two events wherein it could not be assured that a small ele-
ment of the PMMA encasement was removed (rated as mild
in severity due to the small size of the element and biocom-
patibility of the material). There was also one event of an
inability to remove the sensor on first attempt. The investi-
gator referred the participant to a general surgeon who elected
to use general anesthesia for the removal procedure, resulting
in the event being adjudicated as serious. All events had
completely resolved at the conclusion of the study with the
exception of one participant who reported mild discomfort at
the sensor site after removal of the sensor, which resolved
with no intervention after database closure. There were no
incisional infections at insertion or removal. In addition, no
skin reactions due to the adhesive patch were observed.
Lastly, plasma dexamethasone levels were undetectable
(<2 ng/mL) for all participants before insertion and at day 90.
Discussion
This 90-day, nonrandomized, blinded, prospective, single-
arm multicenter study demonstrated both accuracy and safety
of the implantable Eversense CGM system over the 90-day
sensor life. The system was accurate, with an overall MARD
of 8.8% across the clinically relevant glucose range (40–
400 mg/dL) with 93.3% of CGM values within 20/20% of
reference values. There was no impact from either exercise
or compression on sensor recording or values. Moreover, the
Clarke Error Grid analysis showed high clinical performance
with 99.3% of samples in the clinically acceptable error zones
A and B. As with other commercially available CGM sys-
tems,22–25 the sensor was less accurate in the hypoglycemic
range (£70 mg/dL).
The system had a favorable safety profile for its intended
use. Clinicians with limited to no surgical experience were
able to insert and remove the sensor without difficulty after
appropriate training. The insertion, use, and removal of 106
glucose sensors in 90 participants resulted in few mild to
moderate adverse events and one SAE. This event involved
the unsuccessful removal attempt and the need to refer a
participant to a surgical specialist for an outpatient procedure,
who elected to use general anesthesia during the procedure,
resulting from the sensor being placed too deeply at insertion.
In addition, there were no detectable levels of dexamethasone
in plasma.
The Eversense CGM system was designed, in part, to offer
a treatment option that may better accommodate patients’
preferences and lifestyles. The high rate of adherence in the

 study with a median device wear time of 23.4 hours per day
supports that the system did not interfere with daily living.
Furthermore, despite the extensive wear times, there were no
adhesive patch skin reactions, which is of particular impor-
tance as skin reactions to adhesives continue to be relatively
common with other CGM systems.26,27
The results of the PRECISE II study compare favorably
with the original Eversense CGM system, which was evalu-
ated in the PRECISE study.18 The new, updated Eversense
system evaluated in PRECISE II relocated the dexametha-
sone ring closer to the optical detection zone of the sensor and
updated the software algorithm. The MARD value against
reference glucose values was lower in the PRECISE II study
than what was observed in the PRECISE study (8.8% vs.
11.6%). The new sensor and algorithm configuration also
appears to provide greater sensor longevity through 90 days
(91% vs. 82%) and greater accuracy in terms of confirmed
detection rates for hypoglycemic (93% vs. 81%) and hyper-
glycemic (96% vs. 88%) events.
Owing to the blinding of the real-time CGM display and
the device alerts during the study, a key limitation of the
study was the inability to assess the full utility of the device
by the users. Even with this limitation, a 0.5 percentage point
reduction in HbA1c from a baseline of 7.6% was observed at
90 days postinsertion (P < 0.0001). In addition, the recent
study by Kropff et al. using the original system in a non-
blinded manner also reported an association between CGM
system use and a significant reduction in HbA1c, from 7.5%
at baseline to 7.2% at study end, (P < 0.001).18 A quality-of-
life substudy within PRECISE found that participants viewed
the implantable CGM favorably with 86% of participants
reporting feeling better about their diabetes control using the
CGM Impact scale and 84% of participants reported that they
would choose to have a sensor inserted again.28 An additional
limitation was under-representation of non-Caucasian par-
ticipants. Finally, although the study involved placement of a
single sensor for 90 days, the expectation would be that pa-
tients have serial sensors placed over their lifetime. Long-
term surveillance studies will be required to ensure that the
safety profile remains favorable with multiple sensor place-
ments and removals.
Conclusions
The results from this study demonstrate that the use of a
long-term, 90-day, implantable continuous glucose sensor is
accurate and safe with high rates of adherence to use. Addi-
tional clinical studies will be required to evaluate the accu-
racy and usability of the Eversense CGM system among
pediatrics, with reduced calibration frequency, and for ex-
tended durations through 180 days.
