The RNA binding proteins TDP-43 (encoded by TARDBP) and hnRNP A1 (HNRNPA1) are each mutated in certain amyotrophic
lateral sclerosis cases and are often mislocalized in cytoplasmic aggregates within motor neurons of affected patients. Cytoplasmic
inclusions of TDP-43, which are accompanied by a depletion of nuclear TDP-43, are observed in most amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
cases and nearly half of frontotemporal dementia cases. Here, we report that TDP-43 binds HNRNPA1 pre-mRNA and modulates its
splicing, and that depletion of nuclear TDP-43 results in increased inclusion of a cassette exon in the HNRNPA1 transcript, and
consequently elevated protein levels of an isoform containing an elongated prion-like domain, referred to as hnRNP A1B. Combined
in vivo and in vitro approaches demonstrated greater fibrillization propensity for hnRNP A1B, which drives protein aggregation and
is toxic to cells. Moreover, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients with documented TDP-43 pathology showed neuronal hnRNP A1B
cytoplasmic accumulation, indicating that TDP-43 mislocalization may contribute to neuronal vulnerability and loss via altered
HNRNPA1 pre-mRNA splicing and function. Given that TDP-43 and hnRNP A1 each bind, and thus modulate, a third of the
transcriptome, our data suggest a much broader disruption in RNA metabolism than previously considered.

Abbreviations: ALS = amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; FTD = frontotemporal dementia
Introduction
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also known as Lou
Gehrig’s disease, is a neurodegenerative disease affecting
upper
and
lower
motor
neurons
causing
progressive
muscle wasting, denervation and eventual respiratory fail-
ure (Ling et al., 2013). ALS can occur in isolation, or more
commonly in association with frontotemporal dysfunction,
which can include frontotemporal dementia (FTD) (Strong
et al., 2017). FTD is characterized clinically by neuropsy-
chological, speech and language deficits typical of fronto-
temporal dysfunction, and neuropathologically by either
pathological neuronal and glial deposits of either TDP-43
or tau. In the former instance, there is a striking similarity
to those observed in ALS, suggesting the existence of a
continuum of disease (Ling et al., 2013; Weishaupt et al.,
2016). While RNA binding proteins are a major focus of
current ALS/FTD research, it is not well understood how
these proteins interact and/or coordinate RNA processing
and metabolism. Disease-causing mutations in several RNA
binding proteins, including TDP-43 (encoded by TARDBP)
(Neumann et al., 2006; Scotter et al., 2015), heterogeneous
nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 (hnRNP A1, HNRNPA1)
and A2 (hnRNP A2, HNRNPA2B1) (Kim et al., 2013;
Scotter et al., 2015; Kanekura et al., 2016), are reported
to promote aggregate formation in familial and sporadic
ALS/FTD cases. Mislocalization of TDP-43 into cytoplas-
mic aggregates is a major disease feature as it is observed in
97% of all ALS cases and 45% of FTD cases (Ling et al.,
2013). Neurons featuring TDP-43 cytoplasmic inclusions
typically also demonstrate nuclear TDP-43 depletion, sug-
gesting a probable disruption in normal nuclear functions
of TDP-43 such as mRNA stabilization, transcription, spli-
cing or mRNA nucleocytoplasmic transport (Neumann
et al., 2006; Ling et al., 2013). It remains debated whether
these histological observations translate to a loss of nuclear
TDP-43 function, whether aggregated TDP-43 acquires a
cytoplasmic-oriented toxic gain of function (Lee et al.,
2012), or both.
HnRNP A1 is a 34 kDa protein featuring two RNA-rec-
ognition
motifs
(RRM)
and
a
prion-like/glycine-rich
domain (prion-like domain) that is also broadly implicated
in RNA metabolism (Mayeda et al., 1994; Bekenstein and
Soreq, 2013; Jean-Philippe et al., 2013). It is highly abun-
dant in motor neurons and is implicated in the disease
mechanism(s)
relevant
to
spinal
muscular
atrophy
(Kashima and Manley, 2003; Kashima et al., 2007; Chen
et al., 2017). Alternative splicing of HNRNPA1 transcripts
results in the inclusion of a cassette exon, giving rise to a
longer 38 kDa isoform of relatively low abundance and
unknown function. This longer version, referred to as
hnRNP A1B, contains an additional 52 amino acids in
the prion-like domain encoded by exon 7B (Buvoli et al.,
1990; Bekenstein and Soreq, 2013). The biological signifi-
cance of hnRNP A1B remains to be fully elucidated.
Here,
we
demonstrate
that
TDP-43
can
bind
to
HNRNPA1 pre-mRNA to modulate its alternative splicing.
Furthermore, nuclear depletion of TDP-43 drives exon 7B
inclusion. The resulting longer isoform hnRNP A1B is ag-
gregation-prone
and
negatively
impacts
cell
survival.
Finally, in ALS patients with documented TDP-43 cytoplas-
mic inclusions/nuclear depletion, hnRNP A1B accumulation
is observed as pronounced cytoplasmic aggregates that are
distinct from TDP-43 inclusions. Thus, our data indicate
cross-regulation between two ALS/FTD relevant RNA bind-
ing proteins and predict disruptions in RNA metabolism
that are more extensive than previously considered.

Immunoblotting
Lysates were prepared with RIPA buffer (150 mM NaCl,
50 mM Tris pH 7.4, 1% TritonTM X-100, 0.1% SDS, 1%
sodium deoxycholate) with protease inhibitors, subjected to
SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose and blocked with
5% powdered milk in PBS-T. Membranes were incubated
with mouse anti-hnRNP A1 (9H10; Abcam), mouse anti-
Actin (MP Biomedicals), rabbit anti-c-Myc (Sigma), mouse
anti-alpha
tubulin
(DM1A;
Abcam),
rabbit
anti-TDP-43
(Proteintech), rabbit anti-GAPDH (Cell Signaling) and rabbit
anti-HuR (Millipore) in blocking buffer. Membranes were sub-
sequently incubated with HRP-conjugated secondary antibo-
dies
(Jackson

and
revealed
with
ECL
chemoluminescence (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Films were
quantified by densitometry using Photoshop. Subcellular frac-
tions
were
prepared
using
the
NE-PERTM
Nuclear
and
Cytoplasmic Extraction kit (Thermo Scientific), according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. Sprague-Dawley rat tissues
were homogenized with a manual tissue grinder in five vol-
umes of homogenization buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mM
EDTA, 150 mM NaCl, with protease inhibitors). Homogenates
were subsequently adjusted to 1% SDS and 1% NP-40, incu-
bated 10 min on ice and 10 min at room temperature. Some
tissues were further processed with a fine-tip probe sonicator
(three pulses 10 s on, 30 s off, 40% amplitude) to reduce vis-
cosity of the homogenates. Homogenates were cleared by cen-
trifugation
at
16 000g
for
20 min
at
4�C,
supernatants
recovered and the protein concentration quantified via BCA
(Pierce). Tissue lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE and sub-
sequently immunoblotted.
Immunoprecipitation
Lysates were prepared in immunoprecipitation buffer (50 mM
Tris pH 8, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.5% NP-40 and
10% glycerol) with protease inhibitors and subsequently
triturated
with
a
25G
needle.
Protein

Dynabeads�
(Thermo Fisher) were prepared according to the manufac-
turer’s instructions. Three hundred micrograms of cell lysate
was immunoprecipitated overnight with rabbit anti-hnRNP

Immunofluorescence
Coverslips were fixed in 4% formaldehyde/PBS, washed with
PBS, permeabilized in 0.1% TritonTM X-100/PBS and blocked
in 0.1% bovine serum albumin/PBS. Coverslips were incubated
with primary antibodies: mouse anti-Flag (Sigma), rabbit anti-
c-Myc (Sigma), goat anti-c-Myc (Sigma), rabbit anti-TDP-43
(Proteintech), mouse anti-TDP-43 (Millipore), rabbit anti-
hnRNP A1B (custom), diluted in 0.1% BSA/PBS; washed
once with 0.1% TritonTM X-100/PBS and then twice with
0.1% BSA/PBS. Coverslips were then incubated with second-
ary antibodies: donkey anti-rabbit Alexa 488 (Thermo Fisher
Scientific),
donkey
anti-mouse
Alexa

and
mounted using ProLong� Antifade (Thermo Fisher Scientific).
Images were collected on a Leica TCS SP5 confocal micro-
scope equipped with 40� (1.25 N.A.) oil objective and the
Leica Application Suite imaging software. To quantify the
levels of hnRNP A1B, 35–70 cells per condition were analysed
per experiment. To quantify aggregates, a minimum of 100
cells per genotype were analysed per experiment.
RNA immunoprecipitation
HeLa cells were lysed in 10 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 50 mM NaCl,
0.5% TritonTM X-100, with protease inhibitors, triturated
subsequently through 25G and 18G needle syringes, incubated
for 5 min at room temperature, centrifuged at 13 000g and the
supernatant collected. Aliquots of 3–7 mg of pre-cleared lysate
were immunoprecipitated at 4�C overnight with mouse anti-
TDP-43 (Abnova) or mouse anti-Flag (Sigma) pre-bound to
Protein G Dynabeads� (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Immuno-
precipitates were treated with DNase (Qiagen) and RNA was
recovered with TRIzol� (Invitrogen). Equal amounts of RNA
were

aqueous uranyl acetate for 2 min, and examined at 80 kV
with a FEI Tecnai 12 (FEI) transmission electron microscope.
Filter trap assays were performed with HEK293FT and CB3
lysates prepared by freeze-thaw extraction in PBS with prote-
ase inhibitors. Thirty to sixty micrograms of whole cell lysate
was diluted in 150 ml PBS with protease inhibitors and pas-
sively filtered through a non-protein binding cellulose acetate
membrane (0.2 mm, GE Healthcare) for 1 h using a Bio-Dot�
microfiltration
apparatus
(Bio-Rad).
The
membrane
was
blocked with 5% powdered milk in PBS-T and incubated
with rabbit anti-c-Myc (Sigma) or mouse anti-hnRNP A1
(9H10; Abcam).
Cell viability
Equivalent numbers of CB3 cells were incubated at 37�C for
72 h then stained with trypan blue (Multicell) and counted
manually with a haemocytometer.
HnRNP A1B antibody
Polyclonal antibodies against hnRNP A1B were generated in
rabbit using the synthetic peptide CYGGSGSYDSYNNGG as
immunogen (Genscript). This peptide corresponds to amino
acids
281–294
in
the
hnRNP
A1B
variant
(exon
7B,
NP_112420.1) with the addition of an initial N-terminal cyst-
eine for increased antigenicity. The amino acid stretch was
chosen using the OptimumAntigenTM design tool (Genscript)
to ensure uniqueness and solubility.
Patient material
Individuals were diagnosed at the ALS Clinic at London Health
Sciences Center, using the revised El Escorial Criteria. Informed
consent was obtained from all participants with approval from
the local ethics review committee. Details of the cases used in this
study are provided in Supplementary Table 1 and include six spor-
adic ALS cases and three familial cases (one FUS 30 UTR�41 G4A,
one C9ORF72, one C9ORF72/RGNEF), all with documented
TDP-43 pathology (Keller et al., 2012) and five non-neurological
disease controls. (Note, pathogenecity of FUS 30 UTR�G4A is not
known.) Paraffin-embedded spinal cord sections (6 mm) from five
control cases and five ALS cases were labelled with mouse anti-
hnRNP A1 (4B10; 1:100) or rabbit anti-hnRNP A1B (1:200).
Antigen retrieval was performed for 15min using sodium citrate
(10mM sodium citrate, 0.05% Tween-20, pH 6.0) and a pressure
cooker (2100 Retriever; Aptum Biologics). Endogenous peroxid-
ase was quenched with 3% hydrogen peroxide (VWR). Primary
antibody incubation was performed at 4�C overnight in blocking
buffer (5% BSA, 0.3% TritonTM X-100 in PBS). After washing in
PBS, secondary antibody (1:200 biotinylated IgG) incubation was
performed for 1 h at room temperature in blocking buffer.
Antigen:antibody complexes were visualized using the Vectastain
ABC Kit (Vector Laboratories) with DAB substrate. To verify the
specificity of the custom hnRNP A1B antibody, peptide competi-
tion was performed in one sporadic ALS case that had previously
shown hnRNP A1B pathology. The diluted antibody was incu-
bated with the immunogenic peptide (1:20 dilution) for 1 h at
room temperature prior to application to the tissue. Staining pro-
ceeded as described above. A positive control incubated at room
temperature without blocking peptide was run in parallel. Harris’
haematoxylin was used to counterstain tissues for visualization.
Images were collected with an Olympus BX45 light microscope
at 20� and 100�.

 Immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy was subse-
quently conducted on six ALS cases (three originally included
in the DAB labelling experiments, plus three additional ALS
cases previously established to have TDP-43 pathology). After
sodium citrate pressure cooker antigen retrieval, tissue was
probed with rabbit anti-hnRNP-A1B (1:200) and mouse anti-
TDP-43 2E2-D3 (1:500, Abcam ab57105) overnight at 4�C.
The following day, tissue was incubated with goat anti-rabbit
Alexa Fluor� 488 (1:200, Life Technologies) and donkey anti-
mouse Alexa Fluor� 568 (1:200, Life Technologies) for 1 h at
room temperature. After washing and mounting, images were
acquired using a Zeiss LSM 510 Meta NLO multiphoton con-
focal microscope.
Statistical analysis
Statistical significance of experiments was determined using
Student’s t-test with GraphPad Prism software. Error bars rep-
resent the standard error of the mean (SEM).
Results
Loss of nuclear TDP-43 increases
hnRNP A1B protein levels
To investigate the impact of TDP-43 on hnRNP A1, we
depleted endogenous TDP-43 from HeLa cells via siRNA.
Immunoblotting demonstrated that TDP-43 depletion has a
minimal impact on the steady state level of a 34 kDa band
reactive with hnRNP A1 antibodies 4B10 (data not shown)
and 9H10 (Fig. 1A and B). However, a second more-slowly
migrating band at 38 kDawas upregulated in cells treated with
two independent siRNAs specific for TDP-43. This 38 kDa
protein is consistent with a previously described isoform,
hnRNP A1B, which arises from inclusion of an alternate
exon (Buvoli et al., 1990; Yang et al., 1994; Blanchette and
Chabot, 1997; Chabot et al., 1997). To confirm this possibil-
ity, we generated an antibody that demonstrates a preference
for hnRNP A1B (Supplementary Fig. 1A). Using this antibody,
which we confirm is specific for hnRNP A1B in native condi-
tions (Supplementary Fig. 1B and C) and quantitative im-
munofluorescence, we confirmed that TDP-43 depletion
causes a �1.5-fold increase in hnRNP A1B (Fig. 1C). As
ALS/FTD cases typically feature a nuclear depletion of
TDP-43 rather than an outright loss of TDP-43 expression,
we next examined hnRNP A1 levels in cells in which we
repleted endogenous cytoplasmic TDP-43 via exogenous ex-
pression of cDNA encoding asiRNA-resistant version of TDP-
43 with an inactivated NLS (FLAG-TDP-43�NLSsiRES).
Immunofluorescence of transfectants confirmed the loss of
the typical nuclear localization of TDP-43 (data not shown),
as previously reported (Winton et al., 2008; Scotter et al.,
2015; Xiao et al., 2015; Prpar Mihevc et al., 2016).
Importantly, the 38 kDa band was also more abundant in
these conditions (Fig. 1D and E). Subcellular fractionation
indicated that the cytoplasmic protein levels of hnRNP A1
and hnRNP A1B were increased in TDP-43-depleted cells,
while nuclear levels of these proteins were not significantly
changed (Fig. 1F and G). Thus, nuclear depletion and/or cyto-
plasmic TDP-43 accumulation increases the cytoplasmic pro-
tein levels of endogenous hnRNP A1 and hnRNP A1B.
Endogenous TDP-43 binds and
regulates HNRNPA1 mRNA
Since TDP-43 has multiple functions related to RNA me-
tabolism (Lagier-Tourenne et al., 2010), we hypothesized
that TDP-43 could regulate HNRNPA1 mRNA expression.

�2-fold and 3.5-fold increases of total hnRNP A1/A1B
and hnRNP A1B mRNA, respectively, as detected by
qPCR probe sets, which detected either both transcripts
or uniquely hnRNP A1B (Fig. 2A). This increase was not
due to increased mRNA stability since the half-life of
hnRNP A1B transcripts was comparable between control
and TDP-43 siRNA treated cells (2.62 � 0.28 h versus
2.93 � 0.32 h,
P = 0.06;
Fig.
2B).
The
half-life
of
HNRNPA1 transcripts was also comparable in both con-
ditions (data not shown). Additional data indicated that
TDP-43 does not influence HNRNPA1 mRNA via the 30
UTR, as demonstrated using a luciferase-reporter assay
(Fig.
2C).
However,
it
was
also
noted
that
the
HNRNPA1 promoter is more active in TDP-43 depleted
conditions
(Fig.
2D).
We
next
questioned
whether
TDP-43 could interact with HNRNPA1 transcripts using
immunoprecipitation of endogenous TDP-43 followed by
RT-PCR. Indeed, HNRNPA1 transcripts were recovered
from TDP-43 immunocomplexes but not from those pre-
pared with an antibody for a non-endogenous target
(FLAG, Fig. 2E). CAMK2A and TARDBP were used as
positive controls, and HSPA4 was used as a negative
control (Wang et al., 2008).
TDP-43 influences HNRNPA1
pre-mRNA splice site selection
Previously, it has been demonstrated that TDP-43 depletion
results in the differential splicing of more than 230 genes,
favours UG/TG-rich sequences and is implicated in the al-
ternative splicing of several genes implicated in neuronal
development and neurological disease (Sephton et al.,
2011; Tollervey et al., 2011; Colombrita et al., 2015;
Mohagheghi et al., 2016). Given that HNRNPA1 is previ-
ously reported to be alternatively spliced (Chabot et al.,
1997), and that our data indicated that TDP-43 can bind
HNRNPA1
transcripts
and
influence
their
levels,
we
hypothesized that TDP-43 may influence HNRNPA1 alter-
native splicing. HnRNP A1B arises from inclusion of exon
7B, which encodes an additional 52 amino acids. Using
RBPmap, a computational tool that predicts RNA binding
protein binding sites, we identified potential TDP-43 bind-
ing sites in intron 7 (between exon 7 and 7B) as well as in
intron 8 (between exon 7B and 8) (Paz et al., 2014)

 (Fig. 3A). Indeed, siRNA-mediated depletion of TDP-43
followed by semi-quantitative RT-PCR using primers flank-
ing exon 7B show increased amounts of HNRNPA1 tran-
scripts with exon 7B included (Fig. 3B, top), which is
nearly undetectable in siControl lysates. In addition, and
consistent
with

the
band
corresponding
to
HNRNPA1 with exon 7B excluded was also increased
(Fig. 3B, bottom).

 To examine this in more detail, we used a model
HNRNPA1
pre-mRNA
(Blanchette,
1999)
containing
exon 7 and 7B and an adenoviral exon featuring a 30
splice site (Fig. 3C). In an in vitro splicing assay using
HeLa nuclear extracts with normal endogenous levels of
TDP-43 (Fig. 3D, top left), the distal splice site of exon 7
is preferentially chosen and this can be competed with by
increasing amounts of a TG-repeat oligonucleotide that se-
questers TDP-43, but not by a non-targeting control oligo-
nucleotide. Thus, the TG-repeat oligonucleotide shifts splice
site selection towards the proximal 50 splice site of exon 7B
(Fig. 3E and F). To test if TDP-43 can repress the selection
of the exon 7B 50 splice site, we used a nuclear extract
prepared from HeLa cells depleted of endogenous TDP-
43 using inducible shRNA (Fig. 3D, bottom left). This nu-
clear extract displayed improved usage of the proximal 50
splice site as compared to the extract containing normal
levels of TDP-43 (first two lanes of Fig. 3G, quantified as
‘control’ in Fig. 3H). The addition of recombinant TDP-43
protein (Fig. 3B, right) led to a dose-dependent favouring of
distal 50 splice site (Fig. 3G and H). Thus, our in vivo and
in vitro experiments indicate that TDP-43 represses the use
of the 50 splice site of exon 7B in the HNRNPA1 pre-
mRNA.
Elongation of the prion-like domain
confers greater fibrillization propen-
sity in vitro
Both hnRNP A1 isoforms encode proteins with two N-ter-
minal RRMs and a C-terminal Arg-Gly-Gly (RGG) repeat-
rich domain referred to as the glycine-rich or prion-like
domain (Bekenstein and Soreq, 2013). HnRNP A1B differs
from hnRNP A1 uniquely by the inclusion of the cassette
exon 7B, which encodes an additional 52 amino acids
within the prion-like domain (Mayeda et al., 1994). The
centre of this domain contains a steric zipper motif that is a
critical contributor to the intrinsic tendency of hnRNP A1

ease-related mutation hnRNP A1D262V confers a stronger
steric zipper motif, effectively accelerating fibril nucleation
and polymerization (Kim et al., 2013). To determine if

 ZipperDB (Goldschmidt et al., 2010), a structure-based al-
gorithm that predicts fibril-forming segments. Specifically,
hexapeptides with Rosetta energies 5�23 kcal/mol are pre-
dicted
to
have
increased
fibrillization
propensity
(Goldschmidt et al., 2010). From this analysis, two hexa-
peptides (GSGSNF and SGSNFG) generated by exon 7B to
8
splicing
were
predicted
to
fibrillize
(Fig.
4A
and
Supplementary Fig. 2). To test whether the fibrillization
propensity of these peptides was increased as predicted,
we performed a thioflavin T incorporation assay with
these synthesized peptides. Thioflavin T, a benzothiazole
dye, demonstrates increased fluorescence intensity when
bound to b-sheet-rich deposits, such as the cross-b-sheet
quaternary structure of amyloid fibrils (Hudson et al.,
2009). As negative controls, we selected two hexapeptides,
which arise from exon 7 splicing to exon 8 and have no
fibrillization potential (Rosetta energies 4�23 kcal/mol;
NDGSNF, DGSNFG). Consistent with the in silico predic-
tion, the two control peptides derived from hnRNP A1 did
not incorporate thioflavin T. In contrast, as a positive con-
trol, the hexapeptide containing the ALS mutation D262V
(SYNVFG) demonstrated robust thioflavin T incorporation,
as expected (Kim et al., 2013) (Fig. 4B and C). Finally, as
predicted from ZipperDB, both peptides derived from exon
7B
inclusion
(GSGSNF
and
SGSNFG)
demonstrated
increased thioflavin T incorporation (Fig. 4B), as well as
fibrils that were readily visualized by transmission electron
microscopy (Fig. 4C). These data indicate that peptides
derived from the elongated hnRNP A1 variant, hnRNP
A1B, have a greater in vitro fibrillization propensity com-
pared to hnRNP A1-derived peptides.
HnRNP A1B generates cytoplasmic
aggregates comparable to an
ALS-causing mutation
To determine if the increased fibrillization propensity
observed in vitro relates to formation of cytoplasmic aggre-
gates in vivo, we performed immunofluorescence on HeLa
cells transfected with Myc-tagged hnRNP A1, hnRNP
A1D262V, hnRNP A1B or the same mutation in hnRNP
A1B (encoded as hnRNP A1BD314V). Cytoplasmic aggre-
gates were detected in all transfected cells (Fig. 5A). As
expected,
cells
expressing
the
ALS-linked
mutation
hnRNP
A1D262V
formed
aggregates
more
often
than
hnRNP A1-expressing cells. However, quantification re-
vealed that hnRNP A1B and hnRNP A1BD314V transfect-
ants form cytoplasmic aggregates approximately twice as
often as hnRNP A1 expressing cells (Fig. 5B). Moreover,
the proportion of hnRNP A1B transfectants forming aggre-
gates was comparable to cells expressing the rare mutation
hnRNP A1D262V. We also noted that the cytoplasmic ag-
gregates formed following hnRNP A1B expression (wild-
type or D314V mutant) are approximately twice as large
as those formed by exogenous hnRNP A1, and are of com-
parable size as those generated by cells expressing hnRNP

 A1D262V (Fig. 5C), consistent with our in vitro fibrillization
data.
To extend these results biochemically, we used a filter
retardation assay (filter trap) in which protein aggregates
40.2 mm are retained on a non-binding cellulose acetate
membrane. Compared to HEK293FT cells transfected with
an empty vector, lysates from Myc-hnRNP A1-expressing
cells demonstrated a low basal level of retained mater-
ial,
which was
exacerbated by the
D262V mutation.
Interestingly, expression of hnRNP A1B yielded levels
of aggregated material comparable to those of hnRNP
A1D262V,
whereas
inclusion
of
the
same
mutation
in
hnRNP A1B (encoded as hnRNP A1BD314V) greatly exacer-
bated protein aggregation (Fig. 5D). Immunoblotting of
whole cell lysates indicated near equivalent expression of
the various constructs (Fig. 5E). These results demonstrate
that elongation of the prion-like domain in hnRNP A1
drives protein aggregation in vivo.
HnRNP A1B expression is cytotoxic
The cellular consequence(s) of hnRNP A1B expression re-
mains unknown. To evaluate the effect of hnRNP A1B on
cell survival, we took advantage of the CB3 cell line which
lacks endogenous hnRNP A1 expression and CB3 sub-
clones stably expressing exogenous hnRNP A1 or hnRNP
A1B at comparable levels (Fig. 6A) (Ben-David et al., 1992;
Yang et al., 1994). CB3 cells with stable hnRNP A1 ex-
pression demonstrate a modest, but significant increase in
cell
death
compared
to
the
parental
CB3
cell
line
(P 5 0.05). However, stable hnRNP A1B expression re-
sulted
in
a 4.3-fold
increase
in cell
death (Fig. 6B;
P 5 0.002). To determine if hnRNP A1B aggregation posi-
tively correlates with toxicity, we performed a filter trap
assay 24 h post-seeding. We observed that CB3 cells ex-
pressing hnRNP A1B demonstrate more aggregated mater-
ial than those expressing hnRNP A1 (Fig. 6C), consistent
with our results in HEK293FT cells (Fig. 5D). Thus, ex-
ogenous expression of hnRNP A1B induces aggregate for-
mation and is detrimental to cellular survival.
HnRNP A1B accumulates in the
cytoplasm of ALS spinal motor
neurons
Little is known about the physiological expression of
hnRNP A1 and A1B. By immunoblotting of Sprague-
Dawley rat tissue lysates, we found that hnRNP A1 is read-
ily detected in brain and spleen, and is less abundant in all
other examined tissues. HnRNP A1B shares a similar pat-
tern but with highest levels observed in the brain (Fig. 7A).
Assuming that the antibody (9H10) recognizes the two
forms of hnRNP A1 with similar affinities, we estimate
hnRNP A1B steady state protein levels to be �70% that
of hnRNP A1 in CNS tissues. This is significantly higher
than the distribution previously reported in HeLa cells
where hnRNP A1B was reported as 5% of hnRNP A1
(Buvoli et al., 1990), but is consistent with other reports
on rodent tissues (Hanamura et al., 1998; Liu et al., 2016).
Neither isoform was detected in sciatic nerve.
To determine whether this same relationship between the
presence of TDP-43 mislocalization and misregulation of
HNRNPA1 splicing is relevant in ALS, we evaluated
spinal motor neurons of five ALS cases in which TDP-43
pathology had been previously documented (Keller et al.,

 2012). Using an antibody that detects both hnRNP A1 and
A1B (antibody 4B10), immunoreactivity was primarily in
the nuclei of control patients. In contrast, antibody 4B10
demonstrated robust cytoplasmic labelling in ALS patient
neurons (Fig. 7B). Using the antibody raised against a pep-
tide unique to hnRNP A1B, we observed weaker nuclear
labelling in control patient neurons coupled with a robust
and intense cytoplasmic staining in all five ALS cases. The
specificity of this labelling was confirmed by successful
competition
with
the
immunogenic
peptide
(Supplementary Fig. 1D). Immunofluorescence analysis of
six ALS cases (three of which overlap with the immunohis-
tochemistry study) revealed that hnRNP A1B was accumu-
lated in multiple cytoplasmic inclusions in motor neurons
depleted of nuclear TDP-43 and featuring round cytoplas-
mic TDP-43 inclusions in five of the six cases examined
(Fig. 7C). Moreover, in all cases, TDP-43 and hnRNP
A1B cytoplasmic inclusions did not co-localize. It is note-
worthy that two of these cases are familial, thus implying
that hnRNP A1B inclusions are broadly relevant to ALS.
Interestingly, in one case where TDP-43 presented as a
cytoplasmic skein-like inclusion, hnRNP A1B cytoplasmic
labelling was absent. In conclusion, hnRNP A1B is enriched
in CNS tissues and its accumulation in ALS motor neurons
positively correlates with, but does not co-localize with,
TDP-43 cytoplasmic inclusions.
Discussion
TDP-43 plays multiple roles in RNA metabolism including
transcription, miRNA processing, stress granule dynamics,
RNA transport, nucleocytoplasmic shuttling and splicing
(Sephton et al., 2011; Aulas et al., 2012; Scotter et al.,
2015; Mohagheghi et al., 2016). However, it remains un-
clear whether the cytoplasmic mislocalization/aggregation
of TDP-43 observed in most ALS and nearly half of FTD
cases results in a gain and/or loss of function (Wang et al.,
2008; Lee et al., 2012; Conicella et al., 2016). Here, we
demonstrate that the loss of nuclear TDP-43, either via
cellular depletion or by cytoplasmic mislocalization, im-
pacts the closely related RNA binding protein, hnRNP
A1.
Specifically,
we
found
that
TDP-43
binds
HNRNPA1 transcripts but does not influence mRNA sta-
bility. Instead, we found that TDP-43 modulated 50 splice
site selection of HNRNPA1 pre-mRNA such that TDP-43
depletion favoured exon 7B inclusion, resulting in elevated
levels of the longer splice variant hnRNP A1B. That this
change in the ratio between hnRNP A1/A1B isoforms was
not detected in previously reported RNA-Seq experiments
could be due to the inherent limitation of RNA-Seq
approaches to detect low abundance transcripts such as
hnRNP A1B (Labaj et al., 2011). The similarity in the
change of hnRNP A1B levels between total TDP-43 deple-
tion and cytoplasmic mislocalization/nuclear depletion are
consistent with recent data demonstrating that reducing
cellular TDP-43 levels and TDP-43 cytoplasmic localiza-
tion have comparable effects (Prpar Mihevc et al., 2016).
Interestingly, we also noted that TDP-43 may function as
a transcriptional repressor (or sequester an enhancer) of
HNRNPA1 via the promoter; this is worthy of future
exploration.
The presence of the low abundance hnRNP A1B protein
produced by an alternative splicing event was reported 25
years ago, but little is understood about its biological sig-
nificance in healthy or pathological conditions (Buvoli
et al., 1990). Here we demonstrated that exon 7B inclusion
increases fibrillization propensity in vitro and drives protein
aggregation in vivo. In fact, hnRNP A1B forms cytoplasmic
aggregates similar in abundance to those formed by the
ALS-causing mutation hnRNP A1D262V, although they
were noted to be 2-fold larger. Liquid-liquid phase separ-
ation, mediated by the low complexity domains of RNA
binding proteins, is an emerging molecular mechanism pro-
posed to explain the formation of histological inclusions
(Lin et al., 2015; Molliex et al., 2015; Patel et al., 2015;
Conicella et al., 2016). Specifically, it is proposed that high
Figure 6 HnRNP A1B expression causes cell death. (A) Whole lysates of CB3 cells, which lack endogenous hnRNP A1 or were modified
to re-express one of the isoforms, were immunoblotted for hnRNP A1/A1B (9H10) and actin. (B) Viability of CB3 cell lines was assayed by trypan
blue dye exclusion. The mean � SEM of three independent experiments is plotted. *P 5 0.05 **P 5 0.002. (C) Aggregation was assayed by filter

 local concentration of prion-like domain/low complexity
domain-containing proteins initiates phase separation to
give rise to ribonucleoprotein (RNP) granules, the matur-
ation of which is limited by fibril formation. Furthermore,
it is proposed that these structures can convert to patho-
logical RNP granules if fibril formation is excessive (Lin
et al., 2015). It has been demonstrated that hnRNP A1
undergoes liquid-liquid phase separation and can assemble
into hydrogels composed of cross-b fibrils (Molliex et al.,
2015). Although it remains to be demonstrated, we would
predict that hnRNP A1B can similarly undergo phase sep-
aration. Our data indicate that loss of nuclear TDP-43
shifts HNRNPA1 alternative splicing. This increases the
levels of hnRNP A1B, a protein that is inherently prone
to fibril/aggregate formation, and thus may be a contribut-
ing factor in the evolution of RNP granules into patho-
logical inclusions.
Cytoplasmic hnRNP A1 inclusions have previously been
reported in post-mortem ALS cases (Kim et al., 2013;
Kanekura et al., 2016). However, the antibody used in
Figure 7 HnRNP A1B is expressed in the CNS and forms cytoplasmic aggregates in ALS patient neurons. (A) Rat tissue lysates
were immunoblotted for hnRNP A1/A1B (9H10), GAPDH and actin. (B) Low magnification images of hnRNPA1 and hnRNP A1B, detected with

 these previous studies is unable to differentiate between the
shorter, more abundant hnRNP A1 protein and the longer,
less abundant hnRNP A1B protein. Here, using an anti-
body that uniquely detects hnRNP A1B, we demonstrate
that within ALS motor neurons bearing round TDP-43
cytoplasmic inclusions, hnRNP A1B is mislocalized to the
cytoplasm and accumulates as aggregates that do not con-
tain TDP-43. Intriguingly, novel disease-related mutations
in exon 7B have recently been reported in ALS patients
with flail arm syndrome (Paz et al., 2014). That these dis-
ease-causing mutations are confined to the alternatively
spliced exon 7B is significant and implies that hnRNP
A1B dysfunction is relevant. While the physiological func-
tion of hnRNP A1B remains to be demonstrated, we
observed that increasing hnRNP A1B protein levels posi-
tively correlated with protein aggregation. Indeed, in cells
where the endogenous HNRNPA1 gene was inactivated,
hnRNP A1B was much more toxic than hnRNP A1.
TDP-43 and hnRNP A1 are two important RNA binding
proteins broadly implicated in RNA metabolism, each of
which can bind thousands of transcripts (Tollervey et al.,
2011; Ling et al., 2013; Bruun et al., 2016). Any alteration
in steady-state protein levels, localization and/or ability to
interact with protein or RNA targets would be predicted to
have consequences on up to two-thirds of the transcrip-
tome
(Sephton
et
al.,
2011;
Tollervey
et
al.,
2011;
Bekenstein and Soreq, 2013; Jean-Philippe et al., 2013;
Colombrita et al., 2015; Bruun et al., 2016; Geissler
et al., 2016). Although the function of hnRNP A1B is un-
known, it is reported to have a higher binding affinity for
single stranded DNA (Buvoli et al., 1990). Thus, while it is
probable that hnRNP A1B will have the same or similar
functions as hnRNP A1, its mRNA targets may differ.
Alternatively, or in addition, since the prion-like domain
typically mediates protein–protein interactions, it is pos-
sible that shifting the ratio between hnRNP A1 and
hnRNP A1B could have consequences on downstream
pathways. A recent report suggests that VCP, hnRNP
A1, FUS and TDP-43 constitute the core protein-protein
interaction network in classical ALS (Mao et al., 2017).
That these four proteins could be central in the develop-
ment of ALS pathology is because of the finding that they
interact with the majority of proteins implicated in the
disease (Mao et al., 2017). Since TDP-43 is mislocalized
in most ALS cases and half of all FTD cases, studying the
targets and the function of hnRNP A1B may provide fur-
ther insight towards dissecting the network of RNA bind-
ing proteins and downstream pathways that contribute to
ALS pathogenesis.
Collectively, our results show that the loss of nuclear
TDP-43 contributes to cellular vulnerability and loss via
alterations in HNRNPA1 splicing. The resulting splice vari-
ant hnRNP A1B demonstrates an increased propensity to
aggregate and enhanced toxicity. We speculate that this
isoform disturbs RNA metabolism much more broadly
than previously expected and is an important contributor
to the cascade of events that drives ALS.
