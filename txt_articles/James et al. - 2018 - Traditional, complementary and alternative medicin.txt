Key questions
What is already known?
 
► There remains a dearth of research evidence in Sub-
Saharan Africa (SSA) on the drivers and facilitators of 
traditional, complementary and alternative medicine 
(TCAM) use, factors associated with TCAM use, and 
the impact of TCAM use on broader healthcare.
What are the new findings?
 
► Studies suggest a high use of TCAM (particularly 
TCAM products) in SSA, although most studies are 
limited to few countries, and there is a significant 
heterogeneity and low quality of some of the current 
scholarship.
 
► TCAM is used due to its perceived low cost, align-
ment of TCAM with sociocultural, religious and spir-
itual values, and dissatisfaction with conventional 
healthcare.
 
► Non-disclosure of TCAM use to healthcare providers 
is common among TCAM users in SSA, primarily due 
to the fear of receiving improper care from hospitals, 
negative attitude of healthcare providers towards 
TCAM and a lack of enquiry about TCAM use from 
healthcare providers.
What do the new findings imply?
 
► Widespread TCAM use in SSA necessitates health 
departments and governments across the region to 
consider and familiarise themselves with the current 
role of TCAM and its future possibilities within the 
wider healthcare system.
AbsTrACT
background The WHO estimates that a considerable 
number of people in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) rely on 
traditional, complementary and alternative medicine 
(TCAM) to meet their primary healthcare needs, yet there 
remains a dearth of research evidence on the overall 
picture of TCAM utilisation in the region.
Methods We conducted a literature search of original 
articles examining TCAM use in SSA between 1 January 
2006 and 28 February 2017, employing Medline, 
Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, 
Allied and Complementary Medicine Database, Scopus, 
ProQuest, PubMed, Embase and African Journals Online 
databases. A critical appraisal of relevant articles reporting 
a quantitative or mixed-method design was undertaken.
results Despite the heterogeneity and general low 
quality of the identified literature, the review highlights a 
relatively high use of TCAM alone or in combination with 
orthodox medicine, in both general population and in 
specific health conditions in SSA. TCAM users compared 
with non-TCAM users are more likely to be of low 
socioeconomic and educational status, while there were 
inconsistencies in age, sex, spatial location and religious 
affiliation between TCAM users and non-TCAM users. Most 
TCAM users (55.8%–100%) in SSA fail to disclose TCAM 
use to their healthcare providers, with the main reasons 
for non-disclosure being fear of receiving improper care, 
healthcare providers’ negative attitude and a lack of 
enquiry about TCAM use from healthcare providers.
Conclusion TCAM use in SSA is significant, although most 
studies emerge from a few countries. Factors associated 
with TCAM use in SSA are similar to those observed in 
other regions, but further research may be required to 
further elucidate challenges and opportunities related to 
TCAM use specific to SSA.
InTroduCTIon
Traditional, complementary and alternative 
medicine (TCAM) refers to a set of health-
care practices (indigenous or imported) 
that are delivered outside of the mainstream 
healthcare system.1 In the African setting it 
may encompass local herbal medicines or 
products, indigenous healthcare practices 
(traditional bone setting), as well as imported 
complementary and alternative medicine 
products and practices (eg, acupuncture 
or chiropractic). Sub-Saharan Africa is one 
region of the world in which TCAM has long 
been held to be widespread, with a consid-
erable number of its population relying on 
it to maintain their health or prevent and 
treat communicable and non-communi-
cable diseases.2 3 The economic influence of 
TCAM is extensive, contributing at least R2.9 
billion (US$2.2 million) to the South African 
economy alone.4
The increasing uptake of TCAM services 
across the continent in recent decades has 
attracted the attention of policy makers,

researchers and healthcare professionals. In the past 20 
years, the WHO regional office for Africa spearheaded 
the implementation of a regional strategy endorsed by 
African Heads of State in Lusaka, Zambia5 to promote 
the role of TCAM in health systems in the African 
region. The gains experienced since the adoption of 
the regional plan include policy formation in 36 coun-
tries and research promotion, including the establish-
ment of TCAM research centres in some countries like 
Nigeria, Ghana and South Africa. The regional plan 
has also promoted the inclusion of TCAM courses 
into the curricula of healthcare training institutions 
in countries across the continent. For instance, such 
plan has seen the inclusion of TCAM courses in some 
South African6 and Ghanian7 universities. It has also 
promoted the training of TCAM practitioners and the 
local production and cultivation of medicinal plants, as 
well as the establishment of intellectual property rights 
for traditional medicine knowledge in few nations.5 
Despite such progress, African countries continue to 
grapple with an absence of TCAM policy or its imple-
mentation, inadequate TCAM research infrastructure 
and insufficient regulation of TCAM products and 
practices.5 8 For instance, by 2005, only 32% and 27% 
of the African countries who responded to the WHO 
global survey had a national policy and law or regula-
tion on TCAM.9
A steady rise in the prevalence of chronic non-com-
municable diseases is significantly contributing to Afri-
ca’s disease burden, and is adding burden to healthcare 
systems already strained due to the high incidence of 
infectious diseases.10 With high TCAM use for chronic 
health conditions reported outside of Africa,11 it is 
postulated that TCAM will play an integral role in the 
health and well-being of people suffering from chronic 
diseases in Africa as well.12 13 TCAM’s role in the provi-
sion of primary healthcare is recognised in some Sub-Sa-
haran Africa countries’ health policy documents within 
the context of limited access to essential health services, 
especially among the rural poor.14 15
Considering the high utilisation of TCAM across 
Sub-Saharan Africa, it is necessary for policy decision 
makers, researchers and health professionals to recog-
nise TCAM healthcare practices as integral to the 
health-seeking of populations and develop an effective 
response that safeguards their health and well-being. A 
proper policy and practice response to increasing TCAM 
use requires an indepth insight into the nature of TCAM 
use, including the profile of TCAM users as well as the 
drivers and barriers that facilitate and limit the use of 
TCAM. In direct response, this paper reports findings 
from the first comprehensive critical review of the prev-
alence of TCAM use alone and in combination with 
conventional medicine, sociodemographic characteris-
tics of TCAM users, motivators of and barriers to TCAM 
use, safety and cost associated with TCAM use, as well 
as details around non-disclosure of TCAM use to health 
providers.
MeTHodology
research design
The systematic review analyses the contemporary schol-
arship using an established approach developed for a 
number of health research topics.16–18
search strategy
Peer-reviewed articles reporting on TCAM use in Sub-Sa-
haran Africa were searched using the following databases: 
Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Liter-
ature, Allied and Complementary Medicine Database, 
Scopus, ProQuest, Medline, PubMed, African Journals 
Online, Embase and Google Scholar. Hand searching in 
the bibliography of relevant articles was also employed 
to help ensure the capture of all relevant peer-reviewed 
literature. Table 1 shows a summary of the search strategy 
employed. The definition of TCAM in our review was 
based on the definitions of traditional medicine and 
complementary medicine put forward by WHO.1 It 
encompasses local herbal medicines or products, indig-
enous healthcare practices (traditional bone setting), as 
well as imported complementary and alternative medi-
cine products and practices (such as Chinese medicine 
and chiropractic). Vitamins and mineral supplements 
were not considered as TCAM products in our study, 
as these are usually used for general health prevention 
rather than for specific health purposes.
The results from the databases and hand searches were 
imported into EndNote V.X8. Duplicates were removed, 
and the remaining articles were screened based on the 
title, abstract and full text. Figure 1 gives a detailed algo-
rithm of how papers were excluded and included.
search outcomes
We initially identified 1916 articles from the database 
search and from other sources. These papers were further 
screened using our inclusion criteria. One hundred 
and eighty papers met the inclusion criteria and were 
included in the critical review. A summary of the search 
process and categorical analysis of the reviewed studies 
are shown in figure 1 and online supplementary file 1, 
respectively.
Quality appraisal system
We employed an analytical tool adapted from previous 
critical reviews on complementary and alternative medi-
cine use17 19 to evaluate the quality of the papers that 
met the review criteria. The tool appraised study meth-
odology, participant characteristics and TCAM use, with 
1 point given to each aspect under the three domains 
(methodology, reporting of participant characteristics 
and reporting TCAM use). A maximum potential score of 
12 was tallied if all aspects of the three domains were met. 
Two authors separately analysed and allocated scores. 
Differences in the final score were resolved through 
discussion among the four authors, with the most senior 
author having to make the final decision. Only articles 
using mixed and quantitative designs were considered

as they formed the greater part of the reviewed papers. 
For mixed-method studies, only the quantitative study 
component was appraised. Table 2 and the online supple-
mentary file 2 provide the details of the quality appraisal 
tool and the summated score of each paper, respectively. 
Articles with summated scores ranging from 9 to 12, 6–8 
and 0–5 were considered of good, fair and poor quality, 
respectively.
resulTs
A total of 180 articles met the criteria for review. The 
included articles employed mixed-method (n=14), quali-
tative (n=12) and quantitative (n=154) research designs. 
Based on our search strategy, we were able to identify 
studies from 25 out of the total 48 countries which consti-
tute Sub-Saharan Africa. Nearly three-quarters (72.8%) 
of included papers reported research conducted in just 
four countries: Nigeria (n=72, 40.0%), South Africa 
(n=26, 14.4%), Ghana (n=20, 11.1%) and Uganda (n=13, 
7.2%). A summary of the included articles is shown in 
online supplementary file 1. There were very few articles 
with high methodological quality. Of the 165 articles that 
met the requirement for critical appraisal, 2 articles from 
South Africa20 21 had a total score of 11, and 7 papers 
from different countries had a score of 10.22–28 Less than 
a quarter (n=30, 18.2%) and close to two-thirds (n=106, 
64.2%) of the articles appraised had total scores ranging 
from 9 to 12 and from 6 to 8, respectively. Methodological 
flaws were discovered in the selected articles, with only 8 
(4.8%) of studies employing a nationally representative 
sampling strategy. Two-thirds (n=110, 66.7%) of the iden-
tified articles reported a sample size less than 500. Also, 
the tendency for recall bias based on whether TCAM was 
used within the past 12 months or less was identified in 
almost half (n=82, 49.7%) of the papers appraised. With 
regard to the reporting of TCAM use, close to two-thirds 
(66.1%) of the articles reviewed failed to provide a defi-
nition of TCAM. Details of the results of the critical 
appraisal scoring system are shown in online supplemen-
tary file 2. In general, the reviewed articles reported eight 
major themes: types of TCAM used, prevalence of use of 
TCAM, prevalence of concurrent use of TCAM and allo-
pathic medicine, and sociodemographic profile of TCAM 
users, drivers and barriers to TCAM use, non-disclosure 
of TCAM use to healthcare providers, TCAM costs and 
reported adverse effects of TCAM use. In reporting the 
findings of our review, the prevalence of TCAM and the 
sociodemographic profile of TCAM users were catego-
rised into general population studies (including both 
adult male and adult female participants and not limited 
to examining any single specific disease or condition) 
and subhealth or disease-specific populations. The cate-
gorisation was done to highlight the TCAM utilisation in 
the general population and in diseases or conditions and 
specific populations that are considered a public health 
or clinical issue in Sub-Saharan Africa. Disease conditions 
or populations with single publication were grouped as 
others.
Types of TCAM use
Based on the literature reviewed, biological-based thera-
pies such as herbal therapy are the most common TCAM 
used in Sub-Saharan Africa, followed by faith-based 
healing methods (prayer/spirituality) and mind-body 
therapies (massage, traditional bone setting relaxation, 
mediation and yoga).29–53 A few studies examining TCAM 
use among university staff, patients with HIV/AIDS and 
patients with cancer reported homeopathy,54 prayer/
spirituality21 55 and massage56 as the most common TCAM 
modalities used, respectively.
Prevalence of TCAM use in sub-saharan Africa
One hundred and twenty-six of the reviewed articles 
reported the prevalence of TCAM product (self-care and 
over-the-counter use) and practitioner use. Papers were 
divided into two main categories: those reporting TCAM 
use in the general population (including both adult male 
and adult female participants and not limited to exam-
ining any single specific disease or condition) and TCAM 
use in subpopulations (such as a specific clinical popu-
lation). For reporting TCAM prevalence, articles were 
categorised as reporting on large sample studies (n≥500) 
and small sample studies (n<500). In general, the current 
literature suggests a varied prevalence but substantial use 
of TCAM in both general and subhealth populations

(despite methodological limitations in many of the arti-
cles reviewed, including no formal or standardised defi-
nition of timeframe of use).
Prevalence of TCAM use in the general population
Twenty-six articles reported TCAM product use in the 
general population,12 44 45 48 49 57–77 reporting substantial 
prevalence rates ranging from 4.6% (urban settlement 
in Ethiopia)65 to 94% (semiurban settlements in Nigeria 
and Ethiopia),49 72 with an estimated average of 58.2%. 
At least half (n=23) of the study population in majority 
of the studies reported using TCAM products. Similar 
utilisation rates were observed among large sample size 
(≥500) studies44 45 57–60 65 68 76 and small sample size (<500) 
studies.12 48 49 61–64 66 67 69–75
A varied prevalence was also observed among the 10 
articles20 27 28 58 63 78–81 that reported on TCAM practi-
tioner utilisation (1.2%–67% (mean, 28.8%)). Among 
studies with large samples,20 27 28 58 79 a lower use of 
TCAM practitioner services was observed (1.2%–44.1% 
(average, 12.6%)) compared with studies63 78 80 81 with 
smaller samples (37.5%–67% (mean, 53.0%)).
Prevalence of TCAM use in health subpopulations
Pregnancy, childbirth, abortion and infertility
Eighteen studies reported the prevalence rates of TCAM 
use during pregnancy,24 82–95 childbirth94–96 and for preg-
nancy termination.97 Between 12% and 90.3% (mean, 
48.4%) of pregnant women were reported to use a TCAM 
product during pregnancy, a rate consistent across studies 
drawn from large sample sizes84 85 93–95 (25.5%–67.5% 
(average, 45.3%)) and from small sample sizes24 83 86–92 
(12%–90.3% (average, 50.1%)). There is limited liter-
ature concerning TCAM practitioner service utilisation 
during pregnancy, with only one Zambian82 and Nige-
rian98 study reporting the proportion of women seeking 
the service of a traditional medicine practitioner during 
their pregnancy (Zambia: 21%; Nigerian: 44.6%). A study 
of Ghanaian women94 (n=611) reported 11.7% used 
TCAM products during childbirth, while two Nigerian 
studies reporting large sample sizes identified 24.1% and 
42.5% of postpartum women used the services of TCAM 
practitioners during childbirth, respectively.95 96 Close to a 
quarter (22%) of urban Tanzanian women seek help from 
a traditional medicine practitioner for pregnancy termi-
nation compared with 16.9% of their rural counterparts.97 
There is also a limited literature with regards TCAM use 
for infertility, with only one Ugandan study reporting high 
use (76.2%) of herbal medicine among women seeking 
infertility care99 and a Nigerian study reporting high use 
(69%) of TCAM practitioner service among infertile 
couples.100 There is also a dearth of research evidence 
of TCAM use among menopausal women, with only one 
Nigerian study reporting a lower use (3.8%) TCAM prac-
titioner service among menopausal women.101
Sexual health conditions
Three papers, of which two were drawn from large 
sample sizes (≥500), reported Zambian (68%) women 
used TCAM products to dry up and constrict the vaginal 
passage prior to sexual intercourse,102 and Ghanaian 
(56.3%) women used TCAM to manage gynaecological 
conditions.94 The third study (n=224) reported 54.9% of 
male and female Ugandans presenting with various types 
of sexually transmitted infections used TCAM.103
Hypertension, diabetes, cancer and asthma
Seven articles reported TCAM product utilisation rates 
among patients with hypertension32 33 39 46 104–106 and indi-
cate a rate of between 19.5% and 67.8% (mean, 27.1%). 
Only one of the seven studies was drawn from a large 
sample of patients with hypertension (n=500) and the 
reported prevalence in this case was 24%.106
TCAM product use by patients with diabetes varied 
across the four identified studies drawn from smaller 
samples, with a higher rate reported in Tanzania 
(77.1%)107 compared with Nigeria (46%),43 Guinea 
(33%)108 and Kenya (12.4%).109 With regard to cancer, 
the available literature reports a high use of TCAM among 
patients with cancer in Sub-Saharan Africa (Nigeria: 
65%34; Ethiopia: 79%110; Ghana: 73.5%56), although one 
Nigerian study did report a lower rate of use specifically 
for TCAM services.111 A Prospective Urban and Rural 
Epidemiological (PURE) study in South Africa reported 
a higher (61%) TCAM product use among general adult 
population with non-communicable diseases.12 With 
regard to TCAM use among patients with asthma, the 
reviewed literature was drawn from smaller sample size 
studies conducted in Nigeria, and they suggested that 
slightly over half of adult (50.5%)29 and a quarter of 
paediatric (25%)47 patients were TCAM product users.
HIV/AIDS
Twenty-four papers reported TCAM product 112 and prac-
titioner113–115 usage among patients with HIV/AIDS. We 
observed a similar average prevalence of TCAM product 
(1.8%–96.8% (mean, 45.8%)) and practitioner use 
(17.6%–62% (mean, 45.0%)), respectively. Only one 
product-based59 and one practitioner-based113 studies 
were conducted using a large sample of patients with 
HIV/AIDS, and both reported utilisation rates of 1.8% 
and 62%, respectively.
Malaria and febrile illness
A total of eight papers reported TCAM use for malaria 
and febrile illness, with close to a quarter of children 
and at least half of adults reported using TCAM.22 116–122 
Two studies reporting large sample sizes in Sierra Leone 
reported 22%121 and 24.7%22 TCAM products use among 
children, while the rates were higher among adult popu-
lations in Sierra Leone (55%)120 and Ghana (50.3%).119 
An increased rate of TCAM use for uncomplicated 
malaria was recorded in Mali117 between 2003 (24%) and 
2013 (58%). Another large population study in two rural 
districts in Mali documented 27% of individuals with 
uncomplicated malaria used TCAM alone for manage-
ment of their health compared with 50% for complicated

cases.116 On the other hand, a lower proportion (18.2%) 
of TCAM products was reported among 33 children with 
complicated malaria122 The only study reporting TCAM 
practitioner use for malaria was conducted in Nigeria 
and reported a prevalence of 49.7%.118
Mental and neurological disorders (epilepsy and mental health 
disorders)
A total of 11 articles reporting small sample sizes (<500) 
identified rates of TCAM use among patients with 
epilepsy40 47 123 and mental health conditions.23 124–131 
Among children with epilepsy, Lagunju40 reported a 
high use (56.6%) of TCAM products compared with 
38% reported by Oshikoya et al.47 On the other hand, 
Nwani et al123 reported a high utilisation of TCAM 
practitioner service (65.5%) among adult patients with 
epilepsy. Seventy-six per cent of Nigerian patients with 
schizophrenia129 and 11.5% of patients with psychosis 
in South Africa131 used TCAM products. Among psychi-
atric patients in general, a higher proportion in Nigeria 
(73.5%)125 and Ethiopia (50.3%)23 used the service of a 
TCAM practitioner compared with their counterparts (in 
Ghana (23.3%)127 and Malawi (22.7%)128). Greater than 
two-thirds (69%–76%) of patients with schizophrenia 
in Nigeria124 129 seek care from a TCAM practitioner, 
whereas a lower proportion of patients with psychosis 
(11.5%–38.5%) in South Africa126 131 visit a TCAM prac-
titioner. On the other hand, a Ugandan study stated that 
more than 80% of patients with psychosis simultaneously 
access both orthodox and traditional medicine systems.132 
In Sudan, more than one-third (41%) of patients with 
mental disorders had sought the service of a TCAM prac-
titioner prior to accessing conventional care.130
Musculoskeletal conditions
A total of seven (six Nigerian, one Ghanaian) studies 
drawn from small samples reported TCAM product and 
practitioner use for musculoskeletal conditions. Two 
studies reported 96.8% of peasant farmers41 and 40.2% 
of occupational drivers133 as using TCAM products for 
the management of musculoskeletal pain. Another study 
reported 47.2% of TCAM product use among patients 
with osteoarthritis.42 On the other hand, 52.3%, 31.6% 
and 21% of patients with bone fracture from north 
central134 135 and middle belt136 regions of Nigeria patron-
ises traditional bonesetters (TBS), respectively. In the 
Ghanaian study, 29 of the 46 patients interviewed had 
received treatment from a TBS.137
Diarrhoea
Four studies were identified that reported TCAM 
product and practitioner use among individuals experi-
encing diarrhoea.96 121 138 139 A general population study 
from Kenya139 and a paediatric-based survey in Sierra 
Leone121 reported 97.45% and 31% of TCAM product 
use to manage diarrhoea, respectively. In addition to the 
Kenyan study, similar studies from Mali (57%)138 and 
Nigeria (11.3%)96 reported rates of TCAM use for diar-
rhoea management.
Eye diseases
Seven studies,38 140–144 five of which were conducted in 
Nigeria, reported that the TCAM use for ophthalmic 
conditions ranged from 1.6% to 83.2% (average, 28.2%). 
No study presented TCAM practitioner use for the 
management of ophthalmic conditions.
Surgical care
Two studies from Nigeria and South Africa reported 
studies on TCAM product use among surgical patients. 
In the Nigerian study, 40% of 60 patients surveyed used 
herbal medicine during their preoperative period,145 
while in the South African study 7% of 495 surgical 
patients had used TCAM in the preceding 6 weeks.146
Others (infantile colic, tuberculosis, oral health and mycetoma)
A study in Nigeria reported that 32.8% and 3.1% use 
TCAM product and visited a traditional birth attendant 
to manage infantile colic, respectively.147 Also, studies 
conducted in Nigeria reported that 10% and 19.8% of 
patients suffering from tuberculosis148 and toothache149 
had consulted with a traditional medicine practitioner, 
respectively. In addition, another Nigerian study reported 
that 31.9% of mothers with sick children visiting a private 
primary healthcare clinic used crude oil as traditional 
medication.150 In Sudan, 42.4% of patients with myce-
toma reported using herbal medicines,151 while 57% of 
deceased patients who were terminally ill in Ethiopia 
visited a traditional and spiritual healer.152
General inpatients and outpatients
Five studies (three Nigerian, one South African and one 
Ugandan) assessed TCAM use among inpatients and 
outpatients. The current review indicates a higher TCAM 
utilisation rate among outpatients compared with inpa-
tients. For instance, a Nigerian study among inpatient 
and outpatients reported that 72% of the 200 outpatients 
are currently using TCAM products, whereas 18.5% of 
the 65 inpatients are reportedly using TCAM products.153 
Similar findings among outpatients were reported in 
similar studies in Nigeria (89.9%)30 and South Africa 
(60.9%)154 and among inpatients in Nigeria (14.2%)155 
and Uganda(18.3%).156
Student population, healthcare professionals and academic staff
The reviewed literature indicates that 38.4% of high 
school students in Nigeria used a TCAM product157 
compared with 81.8% and 75.1% TCAM product utilisa-
tion rates that were reported among Nigerian university 
students31 and university students and staff,158 respec-
tively. A similar high utilisation rate was reported among 
university students in Ghana (89.1%).35 This rate was 
lower among medical students in both countries (Nigeria: 
28%159; Ghana: 56.7%160) and among paramedical 
students in Nigeria (53.9%).161 In Sierra Leone, 59.1%

and 55.6% of graduating medical and nursing students37 
as well as all pharmacy students36 used TCAM products.
Among healthcare professionals, TCAM use was 
reported among medical doctors in Nigeria (20.7%)162 
and professionals providing HIV/AIDS care in Durban, 
South Africa (23.5%).163 One study drawn from a large 
sample reported that 50.3% of the academic and admin-
istrative staff in a South African university54 used TCAM.
Prevalence of concurrent use of TCAM and allopathic medicines
Twenty-six papers were identified that reported on the 
concurrent use of TCAM products and conventional 
medicines within the general population44 64 164 and 
subhealth population.21 35 53 55 66 89 91 105 106 109 112 117 153 165–174 
The prevalence of concomitant use ranged from 4.3% 
to 69.4% (mean, 30.5%). There is high prevalence 
of concurrent use with conventional medicine in the 
general population (mean, 54.9% (40%–63.7%)). The 
prevalence of co-use of TCAM and allopathic medi-
cines among patients with HIV/AIDS had a mean of 
20.3% (4.3%–47.9%).21 53 55 112 166–170 173 174 With regard 
to patients with hypertension, the utilisation rate was 
higher in a study conducted in Nigeria (47.5%)106 than 
in Uganda (14.3%),105 but a relatively lower utilisation 
rate (7%) was reported among patients with diabetes in 
Kenya.109 Among pregnant women, the prevalence of 
concurrent use was lower in Kenya (20%)89 than Uganda 
(64.1%)91 and Ghana (45%).172 Among the general 
outpatients, two studies in Nigeria reported a varied prev-
alence of 21%153 and 69.4%.165
sociodemographic profile of TCAM users in the general 
population
The sociodemographic characteristics of users of 
TCAM were identified in a number of articles. TCAM 
users were reported in many studies to be more 
common in individuals with a lower socioeconomic 
status20 44 45 62 65 66 71 79 175 176 and who are unemployed 
and unskilled20 69 74 when compared with non-users. 
With regard to the link between age and TCAM use, 
the relevant papers reported variability based on where 
the study was conducted. Generally, studies conducted 
in urban or semiurban settings reported TCAM users 
to be younger (20–50 years),20 58 61 71 74 whereas those 
conducted in a rural setting reported TCAM users to 
more likely be older (>55 years).62 177 An inconsistent 
pattern was observed from the available literature with 
respect to educational status of TCAM users. While four 
included studies reported TCAM users to have little or 
no formal education,20 62 71 177 two other studies provided 
a contrasting view.61 74 Generally, TCAM users compared 
with non-TCAM users in the general population were 
more commonly reported to be married44 45 57 than not 
married.20 Two studies reported on the link between 
TCAM use and spatial location of respondents. A national 
household survey in South Africa identified rural resi-
dents as more likely to visit a TCAM practitioner than their 
urban counterparts,20 while a study among 324 residents 
of the Ashanti Region of Ghana did not find any signif-
icant difference between TCAM users residing in both 
locations.50 The available literature reports an equivocal 
relationship between TCAM use and gender. On one 
hand, two studies from Ethiopia and Nigeria identified 
women more than men as likely TCAM users,44 65 while 
another Nigerian study reported men as likely users of 
TCAM.45 With respect to religion, a community-based 
study in Enugu, Nigeria reported TCAM users were likely 
to be Christians than other religions,74 whereas another 
Nigerian study conducted in Imo State did not observe 
any significant difference.68 Meanwhile, two Nigerian 
studies reported no significant correlation between the 
sociodemographic characteristics of the respondents and 
TCAM use.60 72
In summary, TCAM users compared with non-TCAM 
users in the general population across Sub-Saharan 
Africa are more likely to be of low socioeconomic status, 
while there were inconsistencies in age, sex, educational 
status, spatial location and religious affiliation among 
TCAM users
sociodemographic profile of TCAM users in health 
subpopulations
TCAM users in pregnancy, childbirth and abortion
The reviewed literature shows pregnant women who 
use TCAM were more likely to be of low socioeco-
nomic status84 88 92 93 98 and less educated84 86 88 89 92 98 
compared with non-users, although one study reported 
higher education completion as a predictor of TCAM 
use.84 TCAM users were also found to be younger (<30 
years)84 98 and married84 98 compared with non-TCAM 
users.24 Meanwhile, three studies from Zambia,82 Mali90 
and Ethiopia83 reported no sociodemographic differ-
ence between TCAM users and non-users. With regard 
to TCAM use during childbirth, two studies drawn from 
a large sample of Nigerian women show TCAM users are 
likely to be women who are less educated, from low soci-
oeconomic background, Muslim and primiparous.95 96 
With respect to pregnancy termination, a Tanzanian study 
indicates that women with primary education from both 
rural and urban settings were more likely to use herbs to 
induce abortion compared with those with at least a high 
school education.97
TCAM users among patients with HIV/AIDS
Patients with HIV/AIDS who identified as a TCAM user in 
a number of studies across Sub-Saharan Africa were more 
likely to be female,21 168 178–180 not married,180 181 of low 
socioeconomic status,21 180 younger (<39 years),25 179 180 
unemployed,180 181 educated,21 25 from a rural area21 53 
and of Christian religious denomination.180
TCAM users among patients with hypertension and diabetes
A review of the literature indicates that patients with 
hypertension who are male,33 39 46 of low income level,33 39 
less educated,33 older106 and reside in rural area33 are 
more likely to be TCAM users. A Ugandan study did not

find any significant association between the sociodemo-
graphic profile of patients with hypertension and TCAM 
use.105 A study undertaken in South Africa in 2010 found 
that TCAM users with hypertension compared with 
non-hypertensive TCAM users were more likely to be 
older, without a partner and unemployed.104 With regard 
to patients with diabetes, two studies from Kenya109 and 
Nigeria43 show that patients with diabetes who are older 
and have had at least a formal education were more likely 
to be TCAM users.
TCAM users among patients with cancer
A Ghanaian study reported that patients with cancer who 
were female were more likely users of TCAM,56 whereas 
a similar study in Ethiopia reported that patients who 
have attained at least secondary education, had monthly 
income of more than US$125, presented with comor-
bidity and at the advanced stage of their disease were 
likely users of TCAM.110 However, there were no statis-
tically significant differences between TCAM users and 
non-users with regard to the type of cancer. Meanwhile, 
a Nigerian study did not find any significant difference 
between users and non-users of TCAM.34
TCAM users among patients with eye diseases
Patients with eye problems who are older (≥50 
years),140 142 from a rural settlement,141 143 married141 and 
uneducated142 are likely to be TCAM users in Sub-Saharan 
Africa. However, another study from Nigeria identified 
younger age (<50 years) as a determinant of TCAM use 
for eye diseases.141 Also, a similar study from Zimbabwe 
reported traditional medicine users for eye conditions 
are likely to belong to the Apostolic sect, reside in a 
periurban area and unemployed.38
TCAM users among surgical patients
The two identified studies from Nigeria and South Africa 
conducted among presurgical patients found no statis-
tically significant differences exist between TCAM users 
and non-users.145 146
TCAM users among patients with malaria and febrile illness
Two Sierra Leonean studies reported that TCAM use 
was associated with being male,120 Muslim121 and living 
in a rural area.120 In a study conducted among female 
residents in Nigeria, TCAM users were more likely to be 
older (≥50 years), and less educated, unemployed or had 
a blue-collar job.118
TCAM users presenting with sexual health conditions
A Ugandan study among patients with sexually trans-
mitted infection reported that TCAM use was common 
among those who were married and educated.103 
Ghanaian patients visiting gynaecological units and 
using TCAM were reported to be less educated and 
unskilled compared with non-users.94 A Zambian study 
examining the use of TCAM to achieve vaginal dryness 
prior to sexual intercourse revealed that the practice was 
common among married women and those who grew up 
in rural areas.102
TCAM users seeking infertility care
The two identified studies from Nigeria and Uganda 
indicated that TCAM users were likely to have attained 
at least secondary education,99 100 of low socioeconomic 
class,100 married, never conceived and older than 30 
years.99 The Ugandan study also reported herbal medi-
cine use was higher among women with less than 3 years 
of infertility.99
TCAM users with musculoskeletal diseases
With regard to musculoskeletal diseases, only one 
Nigerian study among patients with osteoarthritis was 
identified, and it reported no significant difference in 
respondent demographics between TCAM users and 
non-users.42 On the other hand, another Nigerian study 
that assessed the utilisation of services rendered by TBS 
reported that being young, male, married, having a 
skilled occupation and of low economic status were asso-
ciated with visiting a TBS.134
TCAM users with mental illness and neurological disorders
Two Nigerian studies40 129 reported the characteristics 
of TCAM users with mental health disorders. Caregivers 
of children with epilepsy who came from low socioeco-
nomic background and had lower levels of education 
were more likely to use TCAM.40 Patients with schizo-
phrenia who are older (>40 years), less educated, reside 
in a rural setting and practise African traditional reli-
gion were more likely to use the services of a traditional 
healer.129 This same study further reported that patients 
with schizophrenia who are Christians were likely to visit a 
psychiatric hospital and faith healer compared with their 
counterparts practising African traditional religion.129 
Another study from Sudan reported that mental health 
patients who visit traditional healers were men, with an 
average age of 31 years, illiterate or with only a primary 
education, and unemployed.130
TCAM users among students, healthcare professionals, academic 
staff and general outpatient population
A Ghanaian study observed that TCAM users were more 
likely to be Christians enrolled in non-science-related 
programmes at the university.35 In Sierra Leone, health-
care students’ gender, age and year of study were not 
associated with TCAM use,36 37 although being a Christian 
was associated with the use of spirituality/prayer among 
pharmacy students.36 With regard to the general outpa-
tient population, a study in Nigeria reported that women 
who were older, less educated and whose occupation was 
fishing were more likely to use crude oil as traditional 
medication.150
drivers of TCAM use
A handful of papers included in our review identified 
a number of pull and push factors promoting TCAM 
use. Key pull factors reported in the literature include

88 98 108 118 134 175 183 184 186 187 190 191 and the perception of

tive compared with conventional healthcare.20 29–32 42 45 48

Patients participating in the identified studies were also 
positively attracted to TCAM for other reasons such as 
alignment with a patient’s sociocultural, religious and 
spiritual values with regard to health and disease12 32 33 
42 68 72 73 81 91 106 110 118 149 181 183 187 188 190 192 193 and the sense 
of patient autonomy of their health.183 Other pull factors 
of TCAM use identified from the literature are patients’ 
trust and confidence in their traditional medicine prac-
titioner to share their personal secrets and the perceived 
privacy they enjoyed with their traditional medicine prac-
titioner.187 194 Perceived psychosocial care and support 
provided by TCAM providers compared with orthodox 
healthcare providers have also been reported as a pull 
factor.98 110 183 In addition, recommendation by respected 
and trusted peers such as TCAM providers, elders, 
relatives and friends has also been reported as a factor 
that drives patients into using TCAM.12 54 111 134 135 161 186 
Aggressive advertisement of TCAM products and services 
is another pull factor.54 73 76 186
The push factors mainly centred on dissatisfaction with 
conventional healthcare, and this includes long distance 
to health facilities,187 unavailability of drugs,22 91 186 187 
difficulty and inequity in accessing care,22 91 106 186 nega-
tive attitude of healthcare providers,106 134 187 long waiting 
time, lengthy procedures and fear of being diagnosed of 
a serious disease.134 192
barriers to TCAM use
A number of population and subpopulation studies 
reported factors limiting the use of TCAM in Sub-Sa-
haran Africa. Studies conducted among Nigerian31 and 
Sierra Leonean36 undergraduate students and Nige-
rian medical doctors162 cited an absence of conclusive 
scientific evidence that supports TCAM practice as a 
common barrier to the use of TCAM. A similar finding 
was reported in a population-based study in Ethiopia.49 
Also, lack of patient belief in the safety and efficacy of 
TCAM was identified as a barrier to TCAM use in studies 
conducted among patients with hypertension,33 pregnant 
women88 and patients with various health conditions,192 
as well as in the general population.49 In addition, two 
population-based studies48 189 and a subhealth study192 
reported that respondents were reluctant to use tradi-
tional medical care due to the perceived demonic nature 
of TCAM. Further, four population-based studies from 
Ghana183 184 189 and Tanzania73 and subpopulation studies 
from Nigeria31 and Ghana192 cited perceived lack of an 
appropriate dose for TCAM products and unhygienic 
practice in product preparation,31 73 183 184 189 as well as the 
unregulated TCAM practitioner practice,183 192 as deter-
rent to using TCAM. Other barriers to TCAM use were an 
absence of health financing for traditional health care183 
and a perceived lack of education and training among 
TCAM practitioners.36 183 189
non-disclosure of TCAM use to healthcare providers
Twenty-five subhealth population studies reported on 
patients’ non-disclosure of TCAM use to their conven-
tional healthcare providers.21 26 33 34 39 40 43 51 52 56 66 82 88 
89 91 106 110–112 145 153 169 194–196 The non-disclosure rate of 
TCAM use to healthcare providers ranged from 55.8% to 
100%, with an average of 83.0%. With regard to reasons 
for non-disclosure, four studies conducted among preg-
nant women in Uganda91 and Zambia,82 patients with 
hypertension in Ghana39 and patients with HIV/AIDS in 
South Africa195 cited fear of receiving improper care as a 
reason for not disclosing their TCAM use status to their 
healthcare provider. Another reason for non-disclosure 
of TCAM use was the conventional medicine provider’s 
negative attitude with perceived lack of support and 
understanding that lead to mistrust and stigma from 
conventional providers. Such reasons were put forward 
by patients with HIV/AIDS in South Africa,194 Uganda196 
and Ghana,51 as well as patients with cancer in Nigeria111 
and pregnant women in Uganda.91 The perception 
among Ethiopian patients with cancer110 and Ugandan 
patients with HIV/AIDS196 that their conventional health-
care providers lack knowledge about TCAM was another 
reason for not divulging their TCAM use status. Health-
care providers’ lack of enquiry about TCAM use was 
also cited among patients with cancer,34 epilepsy40 and 
diabetes43 in Nigeria. A study in Uganda reported that 
two-thirds of patients were open for discussion on TCAM 
use if initiated by their healthcare provider, and majority 
of them were also willing to adhere to their advice on 
TCAM use.196
Cost of TCAM use
We identified 15 papers that reported on the cost of 
TCAM use.20 21 25 27 47 55 71 111 112 117 130 146 167 197 198 The 
current literature shows a conflicting picture among 
studies that compared cost incurred between TCAM and 
conventional care. Some studies suggest that there is rela-
tively low cost involved in using TCAM therapy compared 
with conventional care, although there is variation on 
how cost was measured in the two groups. For example, a 
Ghanaian national survey revealed that the average total 
household cost in the last 12 months for conventional 
care was slightly higher (US$33.43) than costs incurred 
in seeking TCAM treatment (US$30.33).27 Also, a study 
conducted among patients with cancer in Nigeria indi-
cates cost of TCAM ranged from no cost to US$31.25, 
compared with the minimum cost of US$250 for conven-
tional care.111 In Mali, half of conventional malaria treat-
ment costs ranged from no cost to US$116, whereas 
TCAM treatment ranged from no cost for three-quarters 
of patients to US$100.117 In other studies, the cost of 
TCAM was higher than conventional care. For example, 
a Cameroonian study reported that the cost of TCAM

treatment per day (US$1.5) was higher than conventional 
treatment (US$0.77).197 Although cost was not stated, 
Sorketti and colleagues130 in Sudan reported that more 
than three-quarters of psychiatric patients reported that 
the cost of treatment in traditional health centres was 
not less than conventional psychiatric service. Although 
no comparison was made with regard to conventional 
care, cost for TCAM services was relatively high in certain 
cases. For instance, in Tanzania, the maximum cost of 
TCAM treatment for epilepsy was US$100.119 A relatively 
high cost of TCAM practitioner services was also reported 
among the general population in South Africa, where the 
median cost for the last visit to a traditional healer was 
calculated at US$21. TCAM costs can take up a significant 
part of the household healthcare budget. Sixty-four per 
cent of households in a South African study spent more 
than 10% of their monthly spending,20 whereas majority 
(92.2%) of patients with HIV/AIDS who are TCAM users 
in Nigeria spent less than 20% of their monthly income 
on herbal treatment.112 Among surgical patients in South 
Africa, close to one-third (30%) paid less than US$60 for 
TCAM services.146
Findings from studies that assessed the cost per month 
of TCAM use alone reported an average of US$47.5 
(US$12.60–US$96.88).21 25 47 55 167 In comparison 
between self-treatment and TCAM practitioner use, the 
average financial cost in Burkina Faso for TCAM self-care 
(US$2.85) was almost half of that for practitioner use 
(US$4.77).71
safety of TCAM (self-reported or observed adverse effects)
Twenty-four papers reported on the perceived adverse 
effects due to TCAM or in combination with allopathic 
medicines.33–35 44 47 52 55 59 66 69 76 84–86 88 106 110 145 146 153

146 153 199 200 reported on the prevalence of respond-
ents’ perceived side effects due to TCAM products use 
(4%–53.3% (mean, 19.1%)), whereas four35 66 106 153 
reported on respondents’ perceived side effects due to 
concomitant use of TCAM products and conventional 
medicines (2%–56.5% (mean, 23.5%)). One Nigerian 
study153 among outpatients reported a relatively high 
prevalence of TCAM adverse effects when used alone 
(9%) than when used in combination with conventional 
medicine (2%). Gastrointestinal disturbances (nausea, 
vomiting, diarrhoea and abdominal pain) followed by 
dizziness, headache and malaise were the most common 
types of adverse effects reported in 1134 44 52 55 76 84–86 145 
146 153 201 of the 1234 44 52 55 59 76 84–86 145 146 153 201 studies 
that reported on the types of respondents’ perceived 
side effects. A Ugandan study among patients with HIV/
AIDS and non-HIV/AIDS individuals reported that 
TCAM use was independently associated with the occur-
rence of liver fibrosis,59 while another among general 
inpatients indicated that 10 adverse effects were asso-
ciated with the use of herbal products prior to admis-
sion.156
dIsCussIon
This paper reports the first ever systematic review of the 
available research evidence on the contemporary use of 
TCAM in Sub-Saharan Africa. While there are assump-
tions about high use of TCAM (eg, 80%) across the 
continent that circulate in the literature, there has been 
no systematic review to date to substantiate that claim. 
Our review attempts to provide an estimate of TCAM 
(product and practitioners) prevalence both in the 
general population and health subpopulations based on 
the review of the current literature. The reviewed studies 
report varied TCAM (product and practitioners) use 
prevalence rates within and across countries in line with 
previous reviews.202 203 Such variability is possibly attrib-
uted to differences in TCAM definition and sample size 
in different studies and the high tendency for recall bias 
due to variations in timeframes over which TCAM use was 
evaluated. For instance, two large Nigerian studies report 
different prevalence rates of TCAM use during childbirth 
due to differences in study location, method of sampling 
and the way TCAM use was assessed.95 96 Despite an 
apparent conflict between variability in reported TCAM 
utilisation rates across studies, and the high sample size 
and response rate of many of these studies, our review 
highlights a relatively high use of TCAM both in the 
general population and health subpopulations, which 
resonate with findings of previous studies conducted 
in developed nations204 205 and estimates by the WHO.1 
The push and pull factors of TCAM use identified in 
our review also resonate with the drivers of TCAM use 
reported outside of Africa,206 and appear to be important 
drivers underpinning the high use of TCAM across the 
continent. As in countries outside of Africa, the high use 
of TCAM also underscores the substantial role of TCAM as 
a source of basic healthcare to populations across Africa. 
It is imperative for health departments and governments 
across Sub-Saharan Africa to at least consider and inform 
themselves regarding TCAM, its current role and future 
possibilities in wider healthcare systems. This can be in 
the form of TCAM policy design and implementation, 
promoting TCAM training, research and development, 
as well as encouraging consideration of the integration 
of TCAM into mainstream healthcare system.1 It is worth 
noting that as a means of advancing TCAM use, some 
institutions have integrated TCAM into medical educa-
tion curriculum within and outside of Africa.6 207
Our review also identified a variation in patient non-dis-
closure rates across studies which resonates with findings 
from research outside Africa.208 209 The lowest estimate 
identified in our review is sufficiently large to warrant 
concern over communication between patients who are 
TCAM users and their healthcare providers. Insufficient 
disclosure of TCAM use also highlights the need to have a 
clear insight into the barriers to disclosure. The available 
literature outside of Africa indicates that individual and/
or contextual factors may influence patients’ decision 
not to disclose his/her TCAM use status.208 210 However,

are informed by differences in beliefs and attitudes 
regarding conventional medicine and TCAM between 
patients and healthcare providers. In order to improve 
patient–provider communication about TCAM at the 
health service delivery level, it is important for healthcare 
professionals to be aware that their patients are likely 
users of TCAM and to encourage and facilitate an open 
dialogue about TCAM use as routine in their interaction 
with patients. Such communication regarding TCAM 
should imbibe the culture of shared decision making211 
about therapeutic options for patients since it promotes 
patient satisfaction and active patient involvement in 
their care.212 Also, TCAM policy and practice guidelines 
should incorporate culturally sensitive patient educa-
tion about the usefulness of patient disclosure of TCAM 
use to their conventional healthcare providers. In addi-
tion, to leverage communication about TCAM use with 
patients, conventional healthcare providers are required 
to be knowledgeable about commonly used TCAM prod-
ucts and practices to better advise their patients and the 
public on their risks and benefits. The current literature, 
although scanty, indicates a deficiency in knowledge 
about TCAM products and practices among healthcare 
providers in Sub-Saharan Africa213 214 and outside of 
Africa.215 216 As it has been suggested in studies outside of 
Africa,217 218 there is a need for the inclusion of common 
TCAM modalities into the existing curricula of health-
care training institutions and continuous professional 
education programme of the various healthcare cadres, 
as well as making reputable TCAM pharmacopoeias avail-
able in health facilities across Africa.
The reasons for the high TCAM patronage across 
the continent were also examined in our review, and 
they appear to resonate with the push and pull factors 
reported in studies conducted outside of Africa.219 220 
Possible underlying structural factors that help explain 
the drivers of TCAM use include the fact that Sub-Sa-
haran Africa is host to the largest population of people 
who are economically disadvantaged,221 and access to 
conventional care is limited due to cost and distance.222 
Therefore, TCAM offers an affordable and easily acces-
sible healthcare option. Also, because TCAM is publicly 
available and allows active patient involvement in health 
decision making, it offers users greater freedom and 
ownership in terms of their healthcare choices compared 
with conventional care in which health decisions are 
generally controlled by the healthcare professional.223
Our review also indicates that TCAM was used concur-
rently with conventional medicine, indicating that TCAM 
is mostly used as a complementary therapy rather than an 
alternative to conventional care. This may be linked to a 
growing paradigm shift among patients towards a holistic 
attitude in health that aligns with the philosophy of 
TCAM and acknowledges the insufficiencies of biomed-
ical care.224 Given the complex interplay of factors influ-
encing the pluralistic nature of health service utilisation 
in Sub-Saharan Africa,225 further research exploring the 
factors influencing the decision to use TCAM is required. 
The concurrent use of TCAM and allopathic medicines 
is known to also potentially undermine patient safety 
and health outcome due to herb–drug interactions 
leading to serious adverse effect and therapeutic failure 
of conventional medications.226–228 It is imperative that 
clinical studies be conducted to provide evidence of clin-
ical interactions between conventional medicine and 
commonly used TCAM modalities in Sub-Saharan Africa. 
Such information is of value to healthcare providers when 
interacting with their patients as it will help provide an 
opportunity for well-informed therapeutic choices to be 
made that will contribute to maximising patient health 
outcomes.
Our review indicates a relatively low prevalence of 
self-reported TCAM adverse effects when used alone or 
in combination with allopathic medicines compared with 
what has been reported outside of Africa. Although not 
verified, it shows that TCAM like any conventional medi-
cine is not free of adverse effects.229 The relatively low 
prevalence may be due to the fact that patient non-disclo-
sure rate across the Sub-Saharan Africa is high and the 
fact that TCAM is often considered natural and therefore 
safe. TCAM adverse effects can be due to inherent toxicity 
or due to quality issues such as poor quality of TCAM 
products, incorrect or misidentified, or adulterated or 
contaminated TCAM products. Despite the majority of 
side effects being reported were gastrointestinal distur-
bances in our review, serious adverse effects such as 
liver and kidney toxicities have been cited in the litera-
ture.230 231 This has led the WHO to develop guidelines 
for the safety monitoring of herbal medicine product 
within the existing WHO pharmacovigilance frame-
work.232 However, TCAM product safety regulation across 
Africa is still a challenge as many countries across Africa 
lack adequate regulatory framework to ensure the safety 
and quality of TCAM.233 Such challenge is compounded 
by the fact that there are few preclinical and postmarket 
TCAM safety and quality data as in addition to confusing 
nomenclature over plant species, varied cultural differ-
ences and traditional practices across Africa.234 Despite 
its limitations, the use of pharmacovigilance principles 
as part of the overall regulatory framework for TCAM in 
Africa is urgently needed. The incorporation of pharma-
covigilance questions into ethnobotanical or ethnophar-
macological studies is worth experimenting.235 Thus, the 
systematic collection and analysis of TCAM safety data 
is crucial in order to protect patients and the public at 
large.
Our review also identifies, among the general popu-
lation and some health subpopulations, a relatively 
high level of self-directed TCAM use compared with 
the levels of practitioner-directed TCAM use. This may 
be explained by the significant amount of studies that 
focused on TCAM product use compared with TCAM 
practitioner use, or that the decision to use TCAM is 
more often influenced by family, friends and neighbours 
than traditional medicine practitioners.12 111 National

practitioner utilisation both in general populations and 
among health subpopulations will provide further insight 
into the extent of TCAM practitioners’ contribution to 
the health delivery system.
In the general population in particular, the available 
literature indicates that TCAM users are likely to be 
of low socioeconomic class who are unemployed and 
unskilled. This suggests that low socioeconomic status in 
the society influences the decision to use TCAM given the 
fact that TCAM is a low-cost healthcare option compared 
with biomedicine. With particular reference to educa-
tional status, the result of the majority of the relevant 
studies reviewed contrasted with studies from high-in-
come countries that show that TCAM users are more 
likely to have attained a high level of education than 
non-users,206 236 237 but in line with current scholarship in 
other low and middle-income nations.238 The low levels 
of health literacy239 and low access to evidence-based 
health information across most populations in Sub-Sa-
haran Africa240 may explain such correlation. Our review 
reports conflicting findings on the relationship between 
TCAM utilisation and age, gender, religion and spatial 
location. This is in contrast with reviews that focused 
on studies outside of Africa, particularly with respect to 
gender in which women were more likely TCAM users 
compared with men.206 236 241 Variations in study design, 
sample size and data analysis may also explain the differ-
ences in TCAM user profile across studies, principally 
where statistical methods employed did not allow for 
the impact of confounders to be measured,242 thereby 
affecting the validity of the findings. Well-designed 
nationwide, or multinational, studies in which data are 
appropriately analysed are required to understand how 
sociodemographic factors affect TCAM use in and across 
Sub-Saharan Africa.
Our review highlights that there has been a dispro-
portionate research focus on TCAM use among HIV/
AIDS and obstetric patients in Sub-Saharan Africa. This 
pattern suggests the current TCAM research priorities in 
Sub-Saharan Africa and underscores the historic public 
health policy and research attention dedicated to infec-
tious diseases and maternal child health in Sub-Saharan 
Africa.243 Areas that have received less attention in the 
TCAM research agenda in Sub-Saharan Africa include 
cancer, diabetes, musculoskeletal conditions and surgery. 
Given the steady rise in non-communicable diseases in 
the region10 and the high rate of TCAM use by individ-
uals with these conditions,11 12 greater policy attention 
and research focus are needed to understand TCAM 
role in non-communicable diseases prevention and treat-
ment in Sub-Saharan Africa. Specifically, well-designed, 
large-scale studies that look at how TCAM interfaces or 
interacts with conventional care for non-communicable 
disease conditions are urgently needed. Also, for both 
communicable and non-communicable health condi-
tions, the interprofessional dynamics and provider–
patient communication with regard to TCAM use need 
to be further explored.
review limitations and future research directions
Our review highlights key research gaps that need to be 
addressed that currently challenge attempts to provide 
a comprehensive overview of TCAM use across Sub-Sa-
haran Africa. First, most of the studies in our review 
were from Nigeria, South Africa and Ghana. Additional 
data are required from other Sub-Saharan Africa coun-
tries where little research has been conducted to know 
whether findings from less researched countries are in 
line or in contrast to the current evidence synthesised 
in our review. Second, of those articles appraised for 
quality, the majority had critical methodological flaws, 
such as employing a non-representative sample strategy, 
reporting a small sample size, incorporating a substantial 
risk of recall bias and failing to provide a definition of 
TCAM in their studies, all of which undermine the integ-
rity of research findings and challenge the ability to draw 
definitive conclusions and conduct proper comparisons 
across different studies. Similar methodological limita-
tions have been reported elsewhere.236 238 It is of utmost 
importance that the quality of empirical research into 
TCAM use in Sub-Saharan Africa is improved by using 
standardised methodology that follows good research 
design and practice.244 Third, our review identified the 
low cost of TCAM as a key driver of TCAM use, and 
low socioeconomic status was identified as a possible 
predictor of TCAM use in our review. However, only few 
studies in our review compared patient-reported cost of 
TCAM care and conventional healthcare and it shows a 
conflicting picture. Thus, there is a dearth of research 
evidence on the actual cost incurred by patients when 
seeking TCAM care. An economic analysis of TCAM 
use relative to conventional healthcare in general and 
subhealth populations is a worthy focus within the future 
TCAM research agenda in Sub-Saharan Africa. Fourth, 
the majority of the papers reviewed in our study employed 
quantitative survey design and analysis, providing a useful 
snapshot of TCAM utilisation patterns. Such research 
design, although useful, provides limited information 
regarding the decision-making process around TCAM 
use and patient–provider communication about TCAM 
use. Quantitative survey design also failed to provide an 
indepth insight with regard to the interface between the 
lived experience of TCAM use and the user’s religion and 
culture. As such, it is important that qualitative studies 
that focused on TCAM use and practice are conducted 
to help provide cultural and social insights that are useful 
to healthcare providers, policy makers and patients. Fifth, 
only studies published in English were considered in our 
review. We decided to include only English papers because 
none of us are proficient in French and other languages. 
Given that the full text of each included article is thor-
oughly read and understood before data are extracted, 
it will be unwise to rely on the English abstract of papers 
written in other languages given our limitation in other 
languages other than English. It is possible that an inclu-
sion of studies published in other languages would have 
influenced our results. Finally, there are new publications

and other aforementioned limitations when interpreting 
our findings.
ConClusIon
TCAM use appears widespread across many countries 
in Sub-Saharan Africa, although most studies emerge 
from just a few countries including Nigeria, South Africa, 
Ghana and Uganda. Stakeholders involved in the health-
care sector in these countries should be mindful of this 
critical role of TCAM in healthcare service delivery across 
these countries. Further research in Sub-Saharan Africa 
should address a number of gaps identified in the current 
scholarship in order to help inform policy design and 
practice, as well as contribute to providing safe, efficient 
and harmonised healthcare for all in Sub-Saharan Africa.
