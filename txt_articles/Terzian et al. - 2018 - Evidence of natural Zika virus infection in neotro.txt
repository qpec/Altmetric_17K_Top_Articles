In Africa, Old World Primates are involved in the maintenance of sylvatic circulation of ZIKV. However, 
in Brazil, the hosts for the sylvatic cycle remain unknown. We hypothesized that free-living NHPs might 
play a role in urban/periurban ZIKV dynamics, thus we undertook an NHP ZIKV investigation in two 
cities in Brazil. We identified ZIKV-positive NHPs and sequences obtained were phylogenetically related 
to the American lineage of ZIKV. Additionally, we inoculated four C. penicillata with ZIKV and our results 
demonstrated that marmosets had a sustained viremia. The natural and experimental infection of NHPs 
with ZIKV, support the hypothesis that NHPs may be a vertebrate host in the maintainance of ZIKV 
transmission/circulation in urban tropical settings. Further studies are needed to understand the role 
they may play in maintaining the urban cycle of the ZIKV and how they may be a conduit in establishing 
an enzootic transmission cycle in tropical Latin America.

Zika virus (ZIKV) is a emerging flavivirus similar to dengue (DENV), yellow fever (YFV) and Chikungunya 
(CHIKV) viruses that share the same vector Ae. aegypti, in the urban transmission cycle1. However, unique to 
ZIKV there are a number of non-vectored modes of transmission that may involve blood transfusion, sexual 
intercourse, and in utero or ex utero maternal transmission2. Humans are considered the only reservoir host in 
the ZIKV urban/peri-urban transmission cycle, while several species of NHPs have been implicated in the sylvatic 
transmission cycle3 [reviewed in4]. Indeed, the first ZIKV isolation was in Uganda in 1947, in a sentinel rhesus 
monkey (Macaca mulatta), during a yellow fever virus serosurvey5. Several epizootics were reported in several 
Old world primates (OWP) species at the time likely involving ZIKV6,7.
A critical factor for the development of public health strategies to mitigate the risk of continued human ZIKV 
disease is whether a sylvatic cycle of ZIKV transmission is likely to become established in South America, as 
occurred centuries ago for yellow fever virus after its importation from Africa. There are several factors that may 
contribute to the potential for enzootic transmission of ZIKV (e.g., susceptible vectors, vector density, proximity 
to humans with ZIKV infection and environmental factors) and given the broad diversity of Neotropical NHPs 
in South America, the large numbers of primates living in the Amazon Basin and the proximity of some species 
(e.g., Saimiri, C. penicillata) to human activities, understanding the susceptibility of Neotropical NHPs to ZIKV 
infection is critical for predicting future ZIKV circulation.
There is increasing evidence to suggest that New World Primates (NWP or Neotropical NHPs) may be sus-
ceptible to ZIKV infection, since ZIKV RNA was detected in four free-living common marmosets and three 
black-striped capuchin (Sapajus libidinosus)8. The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is a small NWP native 
to eastern Brazil, which diverged from the OWP approximately 26 to 27 million years ago9. Callithrix penicillata 
(C. penicillata) or black-tuffed marmosets are a native species of Cerrado, a vast ecoregion in Brazil that covers up 
to 20% of the territory. C. penicillata is one of the most adaptable species of the Callithrix genus giving its ability 
to explore inhospitable regions and exploit tree exudates. Therefore, as consequence of anthropological interfer-
ence, this species was introduced in urban territories, especially in southern and southeastern metropoleis that 
houses half of the total population of Brazil. Importantly, C. penicillata is present in urban areas highly infested 
with Aedes sp mosquitoes10.
A recent study experimentally examined whether two widespread species of Neotropical NHPs, squirrel mon-
keys (Saimiri spp.) and owl monkeys (Aotus spp.) can serve as a reservoir and amplification host for ZIKV11. For 
both species viremia in the absence of detectible disease was observed and seroconversion occurred by day 28. 
ZIKV was also detected in the spleen of three owl monkeys. While this seminal study confirmed the susceptibility 
to ZIKV infection of NHPs that live in close proximity to humans, it raised the possibility that establishment of a 
ZIKV sylvatic transmission cycle in South America, which in turn could render eradication efforts impossible to 
implement thus provide a mechanism for continued exposure of humans to ZIKV infection and disease.
Common marmosets (family Callitrichidae), have been extensively studied as an experimental pathogenesis 
model for a number of tropical arboviral diseases12. Recently, a ZIKV study using male and pregnant common 
marmosets demonstrated that the animals recapitulated the characteristics of ZIKV infection in humans. While 
adult males did not present and signs of clinical disease, viremia was detected resulting in their seroconversion 
and protection from subsequent ZIKV infection13. Likewise, the pregnant marmoset dams exhibited prolonged 
viremia, viruria and seroconversion, as previously observed in humans14,15, as well as viral replication in the 
placenta16.
In this study, we hypothesized that free-living NHP might play a role in urban/periurban ZIKV transmission. 
Initially, we investigated the possibility of ZIKV infection in tissues of NHP carcasses (Callithrix sp. and Sapajus 
sp.) collected in cities of São Paulo and Minas Gerais States, Brazil. Our results provided evidence of natural ZIKV 
infection among wild marmosets in São Paulo and Minas Gerais States. We then analyzed mosquitoes collected 
in the same region and time that the NHP carcasses were collected in São Paulo State, and we detected ZIKV 
positive mosquito pools. To investigate further these observations, we inoculated four C. penicillata with a low 
passage ZIKV isolate from a human patient. Viral serological and molecular analyses revealed that marmosets 
had a sustained viremia post inoculation, suggesting that these NHPs have the potential to serve as a reservoir and 
amplification host in the urban transmission cycle.
Results
Viral molecular investigation. 
From 82 NHP carcasses (free-living marmosets and capuchin) received 
and analyzed, from January to June of 2017, 32 (39.02%) were ZIKV-positive in at least one tissue sample. In 
these animals, the Ct (cycle threshold) values ranged from 27.64 to 38.47 (Table 1). The tissues that presented 
higher positivity were kidneys (n = 18; ct: 29.17 to 38.47), liver (n = 18; ct: 29.18 to 37.88), brain (n = 15; ct: 30.4 
to 37.71), spleen (n = 13; ct: 30.68 to 38.37), lungs (n = 11; ct: 27.76 to 38.37), heart (n = 9; ct: 29.72 to 37.85), and 
gonads (n = 1; ct: 36.3). All the 82 NHP carcasses analyzed were negative for YFV.
During the first trimester of 2017, 74 Ae. aegypti and three Ae. albopictus mosquitoes were collected in Vila 
Toninho and divided into 27 pools (25 pools of Ae. aegypti and two pools of Ae. albopictus). Six pools were 
ZIKV-positive (Table 1) and one pool was DENV-positive (Fig. 1A–E). None of the mosquito pools was positive 
for YFV and none of the Ae. albopictus pools tested positive for any of the arboviruses. During the same period, 
the Bretou Index (BI) was performed in 649 residences of the neighborhood, where 35 were positive for Ae. 
aegypti presence (BI = 5.4) and five were positive for Ae. albopictus presence (BI = 0.8).
In order to confirm and characterize the ZIKV genome detected in NHPs, we attempted nucleotide sequenc-
ing. Initially, the total RNA extracted from NHP RT-qPCR-positive carcasses for ZIKV was evaluated for 
sequencing, however it was considered of low integrity and degraded and thus not suitable for library preparation, 
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. However, since these were the only available samples, we decided 
to not consider RNA integrity as an exclusion criterion for library preparation in this case, since these were the 
available samples, and we were able to prepare libraries from four NHP.

DNA libraries within the 200–300 bp range were prepared and evaluated on the Agilent chip with a concen-
tration of 5.57 nM on RT-qPCR quantification. Sequencing run resulted in 41,445,050 reads with 97.08% passing 
filter reads (38,870,718 reads) and 97.04% had quality ≥
Q30. On Geneious R8 analysis using a ZIKV genome as 
a reference, a variable number of reads/sample mapped to the ZIKV genome, as follows: 515 reads from sample 
PR 17/05: 1,616 reads from sample PR 17/17; 356 reads from sample PR 17/18, and 1,446 reads from sample PR 
17/19. The obtained sequences were used to perform phylogenetic inferences, using Maximum likelihood (Fig. 2) 
and Bayesian methods (Supplementary Fig. S1). Both analyses showed that the four ZIKV sequences originated 
from marmosets carcasses (PR17/05, PR 17/17, PR 17/18 and PR 17/19) clustered together, within the newly 
emerged American lineage (GenBank accession number: MG770183, MG770184, MG770185, MG770186).

interstitial pneumonia, bronchopneumonia, pulmonary edema and/or bronchiolitis. Thirteen of 16 (81%) NHP 
carcasses had cholangiohepatitis, cholangitis, hepatocellular single cell necrosis/apoptosis and/or diffuse hydropic 
hepatocellular degeneration. Eleven of 16 (69%) NHP carcasses had splenic lymphoid reactive hyperplasia, sinus 
histiocytosis, lymphoid depletion and/or necrotizing splenitis. Eleven of 16 (69%) NHP carcasses had interstitial 
nephritis, glomerulonephritis and/or tubular proteinosis. Seven of 16 (44%) NHP carcasses had brain hemor-
rhage, meningitis, encephalitis and/or acute cortical neuronal necrosis. Seven of 16 (44%) NHP carcasses had 
acute cardiomyocyte degeneration, hemorrhage and/or myocarditis. All animals were negative for YF virus 
antigen.
Geoprocessing. 
After the geoprocessing analyses, a cluster between mosquitoes and NHP positive for ZIKV 
was observed (Fig. 1D). As expected, we noticed the occurrence of DENV-positive mosquitoes in the same area at 
the same time. Due to the animals’ carcass conditions, which were dead upon collection, only five of the 9 animals 
had tissue samples that were amenable to study (PR 17/05, PR 17/15, PR 17/22, PR17/23, PR 17/27) (Tables 1 and 2). 
Among those five ZIKV-positive NHPs, the marmoset PR 17/27 overlapped with a ZIKV-positive Ae. aegipty 
pool. This data could suggest that the co-occurrence of ZIKV in Ae. aegypti and NHPs suggested the possible 
transmission between these urban vectors and primates, which could contribute to transmission in the area.
Experimental Infection Results
Viremia in infected Callithrix penicilata. 
To evaluate viremia, four marmosets were infected with 105 or 
106 PFU/mL of ZIKV (strain HS-2015-BA-01). Serum samples were collected on the day before infection (day 
−
1) and on days 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 12, 15 and 19 p.i. Viremia was detected in the serum of marmosets 1, 3 and 4 on 
day 2 p.i. and in all infected marmosets on day 3 p.i. On the 5th day p.i., viremia was increased in all four marmo-
sets when compared with previews days, reaching a mean value of 1.4 ×
 104 viral RNA copies per mL of sample 
(n = 4) (Fig. 3). Viremia was also observed on days 8, 9 and 12 p.i. in some animals, but no significant viral RNA

was detected after day 12 p.i. The viremia measured in the serum of the infected animals varied depending on the 
animal (Table 3). Throughout the time viremia was detected, all animals exhibited inappetence and lethargy. The 
results indicated that ZIKV infection was established in all four marmosets.
To evaluate whether immunity elicited by the primary ZIKV infection would protect the marmosets against 
subsequent ZIKV infection, we challenged marmosets 1 and 2 (previously infected with 105 and 106 PFU/mL) 
subcutaneously with 5 ×
 105 PFU/mL of ZIKV strain HS-2015-BA-01, 8 months after the first infection. Viremia 
was accessed before infection (day −
1) and on days 3, 4, 5, 6 and 9 p.i. Marmosets did not develop viremia sug-
gesting sterilizing immunity (Supplementary Fig. S2). We revisited the NHPs and collected blood samples 10 
months after the second infection to perform neutralization assays. We observed that the neutralizing antibodies 
titers (PRNT50) were 1:320 and 1:160 respectively.
Haematological parameters in infected Callithrix penicilata. 
ZIKV infection in Callithrix penicilata 
induced leukocytosis in the blood of infected animals on days 7 and 21 p.i. in a two-wave fashion (Fig. 4). No 
differences were observed in the hematocrit during the course of infection (Fig. 5).
IgG titers in infected Callithrix penicilata. 
The adaptive immune response after ZIKV infection was 
evaluated by IgG titers in the serum of the ZIKV-infected marmosets. The IgG titers in the serum of marmosets 
1, 3 and 4, peaked from day 9 to day 12 p.i., whether the IgG titers of marmoset 2 peaked on day 15 p.i. IgG titers 
were detectable until day 19 p.i. in all marmosets (Fig. 6). IgG titers on day 60 p.i. resembled the titers observed 
on day 19 p.i. (data not shown).
Figure 2. Molecular Phylogenetic analysis of Zika virus by the Maximum Likelihood method. The four strains 
obtained from NHPs (marmosets) are highlighted in red. Bootstrap values above 90% are shown. Initial tree(s) 
for the heuristic search were obtained automatically by applying Neighbor-Join and BioNJ algorithms to a 
matrix of pairwise distances estimated using the Maximum Composite Likelihood (MCL) approach, and then 
selecting the topology with superior log likelihood value. A discrete Gamma distribution was used to model 
evolutionary rate differences among sites (5 categories (+G, parameter = 1.7699)). The rate variation model 
allowed for some sites to be evolutionarily invariable ([+I], 52.6922% sites). The tree was drawn to scale, with 
branch lengths measured in the number of substitutions per site. There were a total of 10269 positions in the 
final dataset. Evolutionary analyses were conducted in MEGA764.

Discussion
ZIKV was introduced in Brazil sometime in 201317–20 and reached epidemic levels by mid-2015 and soon after 
spread throughout the Americas with unexpected clinical presentations, such as congenital Zika syndrome (CZS) 
and Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS)21.
In Africa, OWPs are involved in the enzootic transmission of ZIKV [reviewed in4]. On the other hand, it is 
not known whether neotropical NHPs could act as natural reservoirs and amplification hosts contributing to 
the establishment and maintenance of a sylvatic cycle after the recent introduction of ZIKV in the Americas. 
Callithrix and Sapajus species have distinct geographic distributions along the different Brazilian biomes and 
importantly this species’ distribution range extends well within several urban settings22,23. Additionally, it was 
recently demonstrated that three other neotropical NHP species can support ZIKV infection and thus can serve 
as reservoir and amplification hosts into a sylvatic transmission cycle11,13,16.
In a close temporal gap (between 2016 and 2017), Brazil experienced both DENV and ZIKV outbreaks and the 
largest sylvatic yellow fever (sYF) outbreak in over 50 years, which spread throughout the Southeast region24,25. 
During the recent YFV outbreak, we received NHP carcasses from São Paulo and Minas Gerais States, and 
decided to investigate the natural infection of NHP by ZIKV. All animals were tested for YFV and all negative 
NHPs were tested for ZIKV. ZIKV-specific RT-qPCR amplification products were obtained from 32 out of 82 
NHP carcasses. All ZIKV positive animals were negative for YFV in RT-qPCR and RT-nested-PCR and a subset 
that was tested by immunohistochemistry to YFV exposure, were also negative. Our results demonstrated that 
free-living marmosets and capuchin monkeys may be naturally infected with ZIKV in urban areas of Southeast 
Brazil (São Paulo and Minas Gerais States), regions of intense arboviral circulation26–32. A previous study demon-
strated ZIKV RNA detection in sera and/or oral swabs (not further specified in prior studies) from free-living 
common marmosets (n = 4) and capuchin monkeys (n = 3), in Northeast Brazil8. Thus, our results strengthen 
the hypothesis of the participation of these animals in the transmission/circulation of the ZIKV in urban areas.
In order to confirm the results and to better characterize the ZIKV strains circulating, we attempted to 
sequence the genome of ZIKV detected in NHPs. Although initial RNA tissue samples from the animals studied 
were degraded, the enrichment protocol used was able to capture specific ZIKV sequences from four marmosets 
samples. This library preparation protocol is time consuming, and it proved to be useful for sequencing ZIKV 
from complex samples, including degraded tissues. Sequence analyses confirmed the detection of ZIKV, belong-
ing to the newly emerged American lineage in marmosets in São José do Rio Preto.
The molecular investigation of ZIKV in different NHP organs suggested a widespread viral distribution. We 
detected the highest ZIKV loads, indirectly measured by the Cts, in the kidneys, brain and spleen, which is in 
accordance with previous observations in rhesus monkeys and common marmosets experimentally infected with 
ZIKV13,16,33,34. Not all organs showed the presence of ZIKV RNA (Table 1). We believe that this finding may be 
attributed to the quality of the tissue sent for analysis, since we received carcasses in different stages of decompo-
sition and also due to the sensitivity of the test used, as observed previously15.

ZIKV was detected in different organs of naturally infected NHPs. It is known that there are no pathog-
nomonic lesions associated with ZIKV infection, but we looked for histopathological features in the organs of 
ZIKV naturally infected NHPs. The microscopic lesions that were common included: chronic interstitial nephri-
tis; various patterns of pneumonia; vacuolar hepatopathy and varying degrees of hemodynamic disturbances 
(congestion, edema and hemorrhage) in multiple organs, predominately in the lung. The pathologic significance 
of these microscopic lesions is unknown; they were interpreted as nonspecific since they commonly occur in 
ZIKV-negative animals and we believe they lack diagnostic usefulness. Li et al.34, detected lesions in the CNS and 
visceral organs of rhesus monkeys after experimental subcutaneous ZIKV inoculation. In the CNS, they observed 
perivascular cuffing in cerebrum and brainstem and inflammatory infiltrates in the liver and spleen. In the pres-
ent study, only few NHPs presented minimal inflammation in the central nervous system and no developmental 
anomalies were evident. Differences between experimental and natural infections may be related to the primate 
species (OWM versus Neotropical); the natural disease course, may be affected by other debilitating conditions, 
such as parasitic infestations and trauma, which were observed in some NHPs investigated previously. Further 
studies are needed to delineate the pathologic signature of ZIKV infection in neotropical primates.
Since we observed ZIKV natural infection in NHPs, we hypothesized the Brazilian common marmoset 
would sustain ZIKV infection and if they would be a suitable and reliable sentinel and experimental model of 
ZIKV infection. It is known that ZIKV infection of rhesus and cynomolgus monkeys recapitulates many key 
clinical findings, including rapid clearance of acute viremia, early invasion of the CNS, and prolonged viral shed-
ding33,35–39. In accordance, the common marmoset is regarded as a feasible experimental model for the study of 
arboviral infections such as DENV40 because they can be easily kept in captivity owing to their the small size and 
the lower maintenance costs41. In the present study, we were able to successfully infect four marmosets with a 
low passage clinical isolate of ZIKV (HS-2015-BA-01) from a viremic patient with symptomatic ZIKV infection 
in Bahia State/Brazil. The four common marmosets infected with ZIKV had a transient viremia lasting up to 5 
days post infection and the IgG level started appearing on day 9 and plateaued on day 19 on forwards, which 
further corroborates previous observations11,38,42. The animals also developed long term neutralizing antibodies 
as measured by PRNTs months after the infection. The viral load in serum after infection was approximately 
103 relative RNA copies on day 5p.i. Similar to what is observed in our model, the viremic phase of ZIKV was 
previously reported in studies conducted with OWPs and NHPs where the peak of viremia occurred between 
2–5 d.p.i.11,34, similar to that observed in humans43. No neurological abnormalities were observed in the infected 
animals. Hematological analysis revealed a mild leukocytosis in all animals, but no alteration in hematocrit. A

four animals at indicated days p.i. and represented as viral RNA copies per mL of sample standard curve. The 
curve was obtained from a standard sample with known titer after serial dilutions (5 ×
 101 to 5 ×
 106 copies/mL) 
on the plasma of the non-infected marmosets.Values are expressed by RNA genome copies per mL for all the 
infected marmosets. Viremia was detected in the serum of marmosets 1, 3 and 4 on day 2 p.i. and in all infected 
marmosets on day 3 p.i. The figure shows that viremia increased on day 5 p.i. when compared to other evaluated 
days for all the infected marmosets. p.i.: post infection. NHP: non-human primates. Day −

potential explanation for this hematological alteration would be related to, in parts, to host immunological factors 
and it has been considered as a disease indicator. As demonstrated by Omatsu et al., (2012), NHPs infected with 
DENV presented humoral immune response to the infection although the authors suggested that the clinical 
parameters alterations were due to the individual features among each animal44. Given the experimental design, 
no histopathological or immunohistochemical examinations were conducted on experimentally infected NHPs, 
so no further conclusions could be drawn.
This study aimed to fill in a gap of knowledge on natural ZIKV infection dynamics by focusing on the poten-
tial role that free-living NHPs may play as amplification hosts in a hyper-endemic region for arboviruses (as 
CHIKV, DENV and ZIKV). We have demonstrated the natural infection in marmosets and capuchin monkeys 
and experimental infection of marmosets with ZIKV. All free-living NHPs positive for ZIKV (and YFV negative) 
analyzed here, were collected as carcasses and based on the histopatological findings ZIKV detection did not 
appear to be correlated with the cause of death. Most of the animals were found death in urban/periurban areas 
with evidence of trauma. Due to the sYF outbreak that was occurring at the time the animals were collected, and 
due to the fear and misinformation of the population about the YFV transmission, local and sanitary authorities 
reported that these animals showed signs of poisoning and physical aggression45,46. From this observation alone, 
we cannot conclude that ZIKV infection was the cause of death, however, based on our experimental ZIKV

infection study, where animals showed signs of lethargy and decreased motility, it is possible that these may have 
contributed to their demise as they became vulnerable to external threats mentioned earlier.
Recently, it has been demonstrated that NHP (from urban/peri-urban areas, free-ranging and captive ani-
mals) from Northeastern and Central-western Brazil, presented ZIKV-specific (and other arboviral) neutralizing 
antibodies. Although, the samples presented low titers of antibodies, it suggested exposure to ZIKV and thus 
a possible involvement in the establishment of ZIKV sylvatic cycle47,48. However, caution should be exercised, 
since flavivirus serology is uninformative in settings where subjects have been exposed to several heterologous 
flavivirus infections, which reiterates the notion that conclusive evidence requires the detection and/or isolation 
of ZIKV as well as ability to infect and disseminate in biting primatophilic vectors. Thus, we conducted an exper-
imental ZIKV infection where four common marmosets were successfully infected with ZIKV and developed

viremia and antibodies. Our results are in agreement with the studies cited above and reaffirm that ZIKV infec-
tion results in asymptomatic or subclinical manifestations.
After geoprocessing analyses, we observed a cluster of free-living ZIKV-positive marmosets and Ae. aegypti, 
in São José do Rio Preto (Fig. 1D). The neighborhood where the marmosets and mosquitoes were collected is 
surrounded by an area of vegetation which allows the NHPs and vectors survival (Fig. 1C). Together, the city 
is an area known to have high densities of Ae. aegypti and Culex spp. mosquitoes and the circulation of sev-
eral flaviviruses30,31,49,50. The detection of ZIKV (American lineage), in free-living NHPs in different locations 
of Southeast Brazil (São Paulo and Minas Gerais States), supplemented by the experimental observations in 
marmosets strongly suggest a possible role of NHPs in the ZIKV transmission cycle and maintenance in urban 
areas and alert for a possible establishment of a ZIKV sylvatic cycle in Brazil. It is important to note that due to 
anthropogenic interference, marmosets and capuchin monkeys have been widely introduced into urban regions, 
especially in southern and southeastern metropoleis, where nearly half of the total population of Brazil resides. 
Additional studies to analyze transmission chains, including the investigation of ZIKV infection in sylvatic mos-
quitoes would help to better understand ZIKV dynamics in urban and sylvatic environments, in Brazil.
Methods
Study Context. 
In early 2017, Southeast Brazil faced a sylvatic yellow fever (sYF) outbreak. We received car-
casses of free-living NHP collected in a neighborhood (Vila Toninho) of São José do Rio Preto (São Paulo state), 
where our research group conducts a prospective dengue cohort study in the population of the neighborhood. All 
the animals were found dead and the first suspicion was that YFV might have been the cause of death. Some of the 
animals had signals of trauma caused physical aggression. Together with our ongoing population cohort study, 
mosquitoes are regularly collected and Breteau index (BI) is performed to monitor the incidence of dengue in the 
neighborhood. RNA originated from the tissue samples (mosquitoes and NHP), was analyzed for the presence 
of YFV, ZIKV and DENV (only mosquitoes) genomes. After the positive results obtained from the specimens 
collected in Vila Toninho, we decided to investigate others urban/periurban free-living NHP carcasses collected 
in São José do Rio Preto, state of Sao Paulo and other cities of Minas Gerais state, due to the presence of a urban 
population of NHPs and the history of arboviruses circulation. They were submitted to the same analysis regard-
ing the presence of YFV and ZIKV genomes. Based on previous evidence of experimental and natural infection of 
neotropical NHPs8,11, we performed experimental infections in captive marmosets to verify whether these NHPs 
could sustain ZIKV infection and viremia.
Investigation of natural infection of NHP with ZIKV. 
Sample collection. NHP carcasses: A total of 82 
carcasses belonging to free-living NHP (81 marmosets and one capuchin) were received from different urban and 
periurban areas of São José do Rio Preto (SP), from January to March 2017, and from cities of Minas Gerais State, 
from January to June 2017. These NHP were subjected to standardized necropsies, performed by local authorities 
on health services under the yellow fever national surveillance program (YFNSP). Life history and epidemio-
logical data were recorded for each specimen in the National Injury Information Notification System (SINAN). 
Tissue samples including brain, gonads, heart, kidneys, liver, lungs and spleen were collected and submitted to the 
Laboratory of Virology (LPV), in São José do Rio Preto (SP), to Laboratório de Vírus/UFMG, in Belo Horizonte 
(MG), and to Adolfo Lutz Institute (IAL-SP), which take part on active surveillance of arboviruses.
Aedes mosquitoes: Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus mosquitoes were collected in the first trimester of 2017 
(always in the last week of each month), in the Vila Toninho neighborhood, in an area close to the regions where 
some NHP carcasses were found. The mosquitoes were collected in BG-MosquititoTM traps, installed in the peri-
domestic area of selected residences, remaining in each residence for 24 hours. The traps were in covered and 
protected places, next to pots or foliage, hanging perpendicular to the ground, to approximately 1.5 meters of 
height. The mosquitoes were identified by taxonomic keys51,52 and the specimens were separated into pools with a 
maximum of 10 specimens per tube based on the site and collection date, and stored at −
80 °C.
Figure 6. IgG titers in Callithrix penicilata after ZIKV infection. To evaluate the adaptive immune response 
after ZIKV infection, plasma samples were evaluated on days 0 (prior to infection) and 2,3,4,5,8,9,12,15,19 and 
60 d.p.i. by an indirect ELISA. The IgG titers peaked from day 9 to 12 p.i. in the serum of marmosets 1,2 and 
3 and on day 15 p.i. in the serum of marmoset 2 when compared to the other evaluated days. IgG titers were 
detectable until day 19 p.i. in all marmosets.

YFV and ZIKV molecular analysis:Samples of serum, brain, gonads, heart, kidneys, liver, lungs and spleen 
were subjected to molecular analysis to viral detection. Viral RNA was extracted with TRIzol® reagent (Thermo 
Fisher Scientific, Massachusetts, USA) and/or QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), accord-
ing to the manufacturer’s instructions. A 50 mg of fresh or frozen tissues were initially macerated with 200 µl of 
TRIzol® reagent using autoclaved polypropylene pistils. Afterwards, 800 µL of TRIzol® reagent was added to 
homogenize the macerated samples and processed as the manufacturer’s instructions. To prevent contamination, 
recommendations were followed as described by Ausubel et al.53. The tissue manipulation was performed in a 
laminar flow hood. Detection of ZIKV RNA employed a TaqMan® reverse transcriptase quantitative polymer-
ase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), as previously described with primers targeting the envelope gene ZIKV 1086 
(CGCTGCCCAACACAAG); ZIKV 1162c (CCACTAACGTTCTTTTGCAGACAT) and probe ZIKV 1107-FAM 
(AGCCTACCTTGACAAGCAGTCAGACACTCAA)43, using the GoTaq® Probe 1-Step RT-qPCR System 
(Promega, Madison, USA) and/or QuantiNova Probe RT-PCR Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the 
manufacturers’ instructions. The qPCRs using the Thermocycler QuantStudio 3 Real-Time PCR System (Thermo 
Fisher Scientific, Massachusetts, USA), ABI Step one, and/or ABI 7500 System (Applied Biosystems, Foster 
City, CA). Results were interpreted as cycle threshold (Ct)≤
 38.5 = positive; Ct > 38.5 or undetermined = nega-
tive)43. The YFV detection followed previous described protocols based on one-step TaqMan® RT-qPCR and 
RT-nested-PCR methodologies54,55. In the RT-nested-PCR, the thermal cycling was performed following previous 
report55. Precautions to avoid contamination were followed, and positive and negative controls were used in all 
reactions. The viral strains used as positive controls were the ZIKVBR (Bioscience Institute, USP, Brazil) and the 
YFV 17DD vaccine (Biomanguinhos, FIOCRUZ, Brazil).
Viral RNA was extracted from mosquito pools with TRIzol reagent as described by Machado et al., 201256. 
Briefly, 50 µL of 1X PBS were used for the initial maceration with autoclaved polypropylene pistils, followed by the 
addition of 850 µL of 1X PBS to homogenize the sample and centrifuged for 4 minutes at 2,300 g at 4 °C. Following 
centrifugation 400 µL of the clarified solution was placed in a clean 2.0 mL RNAse- and DNAse-free tube and 
along with the remainder sample stored at 80 °C. To the 400 µL sample, 1.2 mL of Trizol (Life Technologies - USA) 
was added and let it incubate at room temperature (RT) for 30 min, followed by the addition of 200 µL of chloro-
form. Tubes were gently mixed and let incubate at room temperature for 3 minutes, followed by centrifugation at 
9,300 g for 15 minutes at 4 °C. The clear upper aqueous layer containing total RNA was transferred to a new tube 
and 500 µL of 2-propanol were added followed by gentle mix and incubation for 30 minutes at RT and centrifuga-
tion at 9300 g for 15 minutes at 4 °C. At the end of centrifugation the supernatant was completely removed and the 
RNA pellet was allowed to air-dry at RT followed by the addition and re-suspension in 30 µL of RNAse-free water. 
To identify the presence of the DENV1–4, YFV and ZIKV genomes, we used the same methodologies described 
for clinical samples as described above43,55.
Nucleotide Sequencing and Phylogenetic Analysis: DNA Libraries were prepared for deep sequencing with a 
ZIKV enrichment kit containing specific probes for Zika virus genome sequencing. The kit is still in development 
and standardization by Illumina® (San Diego, CA, USA), and the sequencing was performed with technical sup-
port from the Illumina team.
First, RNA integrity was evaluated with the Agilent RNA 6000 Nano kit in the 2100 Bioanalyzer Instrument 
(Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. However, as the marmosets eval-
uated were found dead, samples were considered degraded and, therefore, not suitable for library preparation, 
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. On the other hand, those were the only samples available and we 
decided to continue with the library preparation protocol.
Second, the same concentration of RNA from different tissues from four free-living marmosets was pooled in 
order to increase the chance of ZIKV identification. Accordingly, spleen, kidney and lung from PR 17/05, spleen, 
lung, and blood clot from PR 17/19, liver, kidney, and lung from PR17/17, and brain and blood clot from PR 17/18 
were pooled. Then, libraries were prepared with the Illumina®TruSeq® RNA Access Library Prep kit (Illumina, 
San Diego, CA, USA), with ZIKV-specific probes, according to the manufacturer’s instructions, skipping the 
first step that cleaves the RNA molecules. Libraries were validated using both the Agilent High Sensitivity DNA 
kit (Agilent) and a qPCR quantification system (Kapa, Kapa Biosystems, Wilmington, MA, USA). Sequencing 
run was performed with the MiSeq System using 2 nM denatured libraries and the respective reagent kit (1 ×
 75 
cycles) (Illumina), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. A Zika virus strain isolated from a patient sample 
was used as positive control (GenBank accession number KY441403.1).
We combined the reads from all four samples to produce a consensus reference sequence and separately 
mapped the reads from each sample back to this reference. There was no evidence of any differences from the 
consensus in any of the individual samples. Total reads in each sample were 2.38, 4.48, 1.8 and 5.58 million, 
and mapped viral reads were 523, 1606, 392 and 1462 for samples Zika_17_05, Zika_17_17, Zika_17_18 and 
Zika_17_19, respectively. Average depths of coverage per base over all the bases were 3.7, 11.2, 2.7 and 10.2, and 
the number of reference bases with no read coverage were 1019, 260, 2310 and 275 for the four samples.
The evolutionary reconstruction of the ZIKV sequences was inferred by using the Maximum Likelihood 
method based on the General Time Reversible model with Gamma distribution57 on a dataset of 64 ZIKV open 
reading frames (ORFs). The reliability of branching patterns was tested through 1000 bootstrap sampling. In 
parallel, a phylogenetic tree using the same alignment was also generated using Bayesian analysis (Supplementary 
material).
Histopathological and immunohistochemical analysis: For histopathological analysis, tissue from 16 NHP (15 
marmosets and one capuchin from São José do Rio Preto) including brain, gonads, heart, kidneys, liver, lungs and 
spleen were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin, processed and stained with hematoxylin and eosin for light 
microscopic examination.
For YFV immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis, silanized slides with liver tissue sections were subjected to 
wet antigen retrieval in a pressure cooker (Tris-EDTA solution 100 mM, pH 9.0). Endogenous peroxidase was

blocked with 6% hydrogen peroxide for 40 min. An in house primary polyclonal anti-YF antibody (dilution 
1:40,000; derived from hyperimmune mouse serum) was used, followed by overnight incubation (18 h) at 4 °C. 
Signal amplification was achieved with HiDef Detection™ HRP Polymer System (Cell Marque/Sigma-Aldrich, 
California, USA) by 30 min at 37 °C, followed by visualization with diaminobenzidine (D-5637; Sigma, St. Louis, 
MO, USA). The slides were mounted with aqueous media. Known NWP and human positive and negative control 
tissues with omitted first-layer antibody were included.
Geoprocessing. 
The information regarding the sites where nine NHP carcasses were found and where Ae. 
aegypti mosquitoes were sampled in Vila Toninho were geocoded with the TerraView program (INPE, São José 
dos Campos-SP, Brazil). The shapefiles were layered in the ArcGIS program (ESRI, Redlands, CA, USA), and 
spatial-temporal associations between the positive mosquitoes and primates were analyzed. In order to observe 
the results, thematic maps were constructed.
Experimental Study. 
Virus stock. A low passage of ZIKVBR58 and ZIKV isolate (HS-2015-BA-01; 2015 - 
accession No. KX520666) from a viremic patient in Bahia State, Brazil were used. A virus stock was produced in 
the Ae. albopictus C6/36 cell line. Supernatant was harvested 96 hours post infection (hpi) and virus stocks were 
titered by plaque assay in Vero cells. The virus inoculum was removed, following the addition of an overlay media 
containing 1.5% w/v carboxymethylcellulose (Synth, São Paulo, Brazil) in 2% FBS v/v DMEM. Seven days post 
infection (dpi), plates were fixed, washed and stained with methylene blue (Synth, São Paulo, Brazil) 1% w/v. 
Results were expressed as PFU/mL.
Experimental infection in marmosets. Four male black-tufted marmosets (Callithrix penicillata) were obtained 
from a breeding colony at the ‘Biotério de Primatas não Humanos’(Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil). The animals 
were of various ages, ranging from one to ten-years-old. Marmosets were divided in four groups NHP 1, NHP2, 
NHP3, NHP4 and were infected subcutaneously with 105 (NHP 1 and NHP 3) or 106 PFU (NHP 2 and NHP 4) of 
ZIKV (HS-2015-BA-01) diluted in 500 µL of saline 0.9%. The animals were housed individually in four different 
cages (31cm-long,76cm-high and62cm-wide) and observed daily for 28 days. They were kept under a natural 
light regime under specific pathogen-free conditions. To evaluate whether immunity elicited by a primary ZIKV 
infection, NHP1 and NHP 2 were re-infected subcutaneously with 5 105 PFU of ZIKV (HS-2015-BA-01) eight 
months later after the first infection (Supplementary material).
Plaque Neutralization Test. The Vero E6 cell line was maintained in Eagle’s Minimum Essential Medium (MEM, 
Cultilab, Brazil) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Sera samples assayed to determine the 
specific neutralization antibody titers based on a modified protocol described previously59. Briefly, the PRNT 
was performed in 24-well plates with 80,000 Vero E6 cells/well, using a fixed ZIKVBR virus inoculum (~800 PFU) 
against varying serum dilutions (1:20-1:640). The plates were overlaid with a semi-solid medium (MEM 1 ×
 , 1% 
FBS, 1.5% carboxymethylcellulose) and incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 5 days. The cell monolayer was fixed 
with 10% formalin solution and stained with 1% crystal violet solution. The PRNT titers were scored as reciprocal 
of the highest dilution of serum that inhibited 50% of plaques (PRNT50). Samples scored as PRNT 50 < 20, were 
considered negative.
Biological specimens collection and analysis. Whole blood samples were collected from the right femoral vein in 
EDTA-containing tubes. Blood samples were collected in different days either prior (day 0) or after the infection 
(from 2 to 28 dpi) for hematological analysis such as total leukocyte count (TLC), hematocrit analysis and for viral 
quantification by RT-qPCR.
Viral quantification by RT-qPCR. Viral RNA was obtained using the RNeasy Kit (Qiagen) and the One-step 
qRT-PCR was performed using QuantiNova Probe RT-PCR Kit (Qiagen, Heiden, Germany). Primers/probe sets 
specific for ZIKV were designed as described43. The standard curve was created using ten-fold dilutions of an 
international World Health Organization (WHO) Zika virus standard ranging from 5 ×
 102 to 5 ×
 106 genome 
copies/mL designed as described60,61. Amplification was performed on an ABI 7500 System (Applied Biosystems, 
Foster City, CA) using the following procedure: 45 °C for 10 min, 95 °C for 5 min, and 45 cycles at 95 °C for 5 s and 
60 °C for 30 s. Results were expressed as genome copies/mL.
Haematological parameters. 
For total leucocyte count, the whole blood was diluted at 1:40 in TURK 
(IMBRALAB®) solution and the total cell count quantified in an optical microscope using a Neubauer cham-
ber. Also, to determine the hematocrit, a sample of whole blood was collected into heparinized capillary tubes 
(Perfecta, São Paulo, Brazil) and centrifuged for 10 min in a hematocrit centrifuge (Fanem, Sao Paulo, Brazil). 
Results are presented as counts/mm3 per mL of blood (cells) or percentage. The rest of the blood was centrifuged 
for 10 min at 400 ×
 g to collect the plasma. Plasma samples were stored frozen at −
70 °C for RT-qPCR analysis 
and at −
20 °C for indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (iELISA)assay.
Indirect ELISA. The indirect (i)ELISA to measure the immunoglobulin (Ig)-G titers in sera from the infected 
marmosets was performed as described with modification62. Briefly, ZIKV isolate (HS-2015-BA-01) was 
UV-inactivated and diluted in 0.01 M carbonate buffer (pH 9.6) to a concentration of 5 ×
 105 PFU per well and 
incubated overnight. The plate was washed three times and blocked with 1% nonfat dry milk for 2 h. Serum was 
diluted (1:100), plated in duplicate, and incubated for 3 h. After another wash, plates were incubated for 2 h with an 
anti-human IgG (Fc specific) −
peroxidase antibody (A0170 Sigma) diluted to 1:2000. Ortho-phenylenediamine 
was used as a substrate, and the reaction was stopped with 1 M sulfuric acid. Absorbance was measured at 492 nm.

Samples of ZIKV-infected marmosets were considered positive in the first dilution in which mock samples were 
negative, and results were expressed as optical densities (OD).
Ethics. 
The black-tufted marmosets were provided by the Brazilian Institute of Environment and Renewable 
Natural Resources (IBAMA) and accommodated at ‘Biotério de Primatas não Humanos’ (city of Belo Horizonte, 
MG, Brazil). They were certified by the System of Authorization and Information on Biodiversity (SISBIO) under 
the protocol number: 3106.6995/2012-MG. The experimental protocol was submitted to the Committee on 
Animal Ethics (CEUA) of the UFMG, with permit protocol number: 98/2017. Studies with ZIKV were conducted 
under Biocontainment level 2 (BCL2) at the ‘Laboratório de Imunofarmacologia at the Instituto de Ciências 
Biológicas (ICB) from the UFMG. All methods were performed in accordance with the guidelines and regulations 
described by CONCEA (2015)63.
