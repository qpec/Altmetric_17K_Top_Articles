Objective: This study assessed differences in diabetes preva-
lence based on race-ethnicity among people with severe
mental illnesses.
Methods: This retrospective cohort study examined diabetes
prevalence in 2009 among California Medicaid enrollees
with severe mental illness who were screened for diabetes
(N=19,364). Poisson regression assessed differences in di-
abetes prevalence by race-ethnicity. The sample was stan-
dardized to the U.S. population.
Results: The overall prevalence of diabetes was 32.0%. The
adjusted prevalence for all minority groups with severe mental
illness, except for Asians, was significantly higher than for whites
(1.21–1.28 adjusted prevalence ratios). With inverse probability
weighting to reduce selection bias captured by measured fac-
tors, estimated prevalence of diabetes among screened par-
ticipants was 27.3%.
Conclusions: Theprevalenceofdiabetesinminoritygroupswith
severe mental illness was significantly higher than among whites
with severe mental illness. Mental health administrators should
implement universal diabetes screening with specific outreach
efforts targeting minority populations with severe mental illness.

There is a significant mortality gap between people with
severe mental illness (for example, schizophrenia and bi-
polar disorder) and the general population, with estimates of
earlier mortality ranging from ten to 25 years, most com-
monly from cardiovascular disease (CVD) (1,2). Because di-
abetes is a potent CVD risk factor, it is concerning that a large
systematic review of studies conducted between 1987 and
2005 estimated that 15% of people with severe mental illness
have type 2 diabetes (3), a prevalence two to three times
higher than age-matched samples from the general pop-
ulation (8.4% in the general population, according to data
from the 2005–2010 National Health and Nutrition Exami-
nation Survey [NHANES]) (4). Antipsychotic medications,
particularly second-generation antipsychotics, contribute
to the risk of diabetes (5). In fact, in 2004 the American Di-
abetes Association recommended annual diabetes screening
for anyone taking second-generation antipsychotic medica-
tions, regardless of age or predisposing factors (6).
Despite differences in diabetes prevalence among U.S.
racial-ethnic populations (4), no large studies have rigorously
explored differences in diabetes among diverse populations
with severe mental illness taking antipsychotic medications
(7). This lack of data is concerning, given reviews suggesting
that individuals from racial-ethnic minority groups who have
severe mental illness may have a higher risk of developing
diabetes from antipsychotic treatment, implying a double
disease burden in this cohort (7,8).
Our study filled this gap in the literature by examining
racial-ethnic differences in diabetes prevalence in a large,
diverse population with severe mental illness taking anti-
psychotic medications. To our knowledge, this is the largest
study examining diabetes among outpatients served in any
public mental health care system.
METHODS
This retrospective cohort study examined administrative,
pharmacy, and billing data from California Medicaid (Medi-
Cal) and the Client and Service Information (CSI) system
from January 1 to December 31, 2009. The CSI system utilizes
encounter-based data to track state- and county-funded out-
patient mental health service use in California. After obtaining
approvals as previously described (9), the California De-
partment of Health Care Services combined these databases
and provided a unique deidentified data set to investigators.
The following criteria characterized the cohort (N=19,364):
age $18 and ,68, utilized community mental health services,
prescribed an antipsychotic medication at least once during

BRIEF REPORTS
 the study period, enrolled in Medi-Cal, not dually eligible for
Medicare, and either screened for diabetes (glucose-specific
fasting serum test [CPT codes 82947, 82948, 82950, or 82951]
or hemoglobin A1c (CPT code 83036]) or had preexisting
diabetes during the study period. The dually eligible pop-
ulation was excluded because Medicare laboratory billing
data were unavailable. Of note, diabetes screening guide-
lines for anyone taking second-generation antipsychotic
medications were distributed to health plans before the
study period (6). However, there was variable enforcement
of the guidelines and no formal policies on diabetes screening
of antipsychotic-treated adults.
The primary outcome measure was diabetes, defined by a
diabetes diagnosis (ICD-9 codes 249.xx, 250.xx, 253.xx, and
648.xx) or an antidiabetic prescription claim during the
study period. [A table in an online supplement to this report
lists the antipsychotic classes and specific medications.] The
database included additional variables, such as age, gender,
race-ethnicity, county type, psychiatric diagnosis, and sub-
stance use disorder diagnoses. Individuals with multiple
psychiatric comorbidities were classified hierarchically, and
counties were dichotomized into rural or urban, as previously
described (9).
Descriptive statistics were used to show the distribution
of demographic and clinical characteristics by diabetes sta-
tus. To facilitate comparisons with the general population,
we estimated adjusted diabetes prevalence by using direct
standardization to the distribution of the adult U.S. pop-
ulation by age, sex, and race-ethnicity on the basis of U.S.
Census Bureau data for 2009. In this procedure, overall di-
abetes prevalence was estimated by a weighted average of
sample diabetes prevalence within each age, sex, and racial-
ethnic stratum, with weights given by the proportions of the
overall U.S. population accounted for by each subgroup.
Adjusted Poisson regression models were used to estimate
the overall effects on prevalence of diabetes of gender, race-
ethnicity, age, county type, psychiatric diagnosis, substance
use diagnosis, and health care utilization. We used a directed
acyclic graph to summarize hypothesized causal relationships
between variables in order to distinguish the confounders and
mediators of each predictor. Models specific to each predictor
of interest were used to estimate overall effects, by adjusting
for variables that influence the predictor variable and diabetes
(confounders) but excluding factors on the causal pathway
between them (mediators). Models excluding confounders
would provide biased estimates, whereas models including
mediators would at best estimate direct effects via other
pathways. Poisson regression was used as the best approxi-
mation of prevalence ratio. Because California delegates de-
livery of mental health services to its counties, we used robust
standard errors to account for clustering of outcomes by
county and to accommodate use of a Poisson model for a
binary outcome. As previously described, seven rural counties
were grouped, and one county was excluded (9).
Given the low diabetes screening rates we have pre-
viously documented (9), estimating diabetes prevalence in
the screened sample could have overestimated prevalence,
because patients with diabetes risk factors, some unmeasured,
were almost surely overrepresented the screened sample. To
address this, we used inverse weighting based on available
covariates to remove some but probably not all of the selection
bias. In addition, to provide a conservative lower bound, we
estimated prevalence by using the entire sample, which we
recognize is biased low by omission of cases among the un-
screened [see online supplement].
RESULTS
The prevalence of diabetes in this sample was 32.0% (N=6,195
of 19,364). Table 1 shows adjusted differences in prevalence
on the basis of patient characteristics. Compared with the rate
among white patients, diabetes prevalence was higher among
black patients (adjusted prevalence ratio [APR]=1.24) and
Hispanic patients (APR=1.28) (p,.001). In addition, compared
with the rate among patients with schizophrenia, diabetes
prevalence was significantly lower among patients with
bipolar disorder (APR=.88) and major depressive disorder
(APR=.83) (p,.001).
After direct standardization to the demographic distribu-
tion of the U.S. population, the adjusted prevalence was 27.3%.
Differences in prevalence were found by race-ethnicity, with
whites having the lowest prevalence (26.5%) and other mi-
nority groups having higher rates (blacks, 29.7%; Hispanics,
29.7%; Asians, 27.2%; and other, 28.4%).
With inverse probability weighting to reduce selection
bias captured by measured factors (9), the estimated overall
prevalence of diabetes was 27.8% [see online supplement].
The standardized lower-bound estimate of diabetes, which
was based on the larger parent study that included close to
70% who were unscreened for diabetes, was 9.6% (9).
DISCUSSION
Our study filled a gap in the literature by documenting a
significantly higher risk of diabetes among racial-ethnic
minority group members with severe mental illness, com-
pared with their white counterparts, even after the rate was
standardized to the U.S. population and the analysis con-
trolled for confounding variables. Our results confirm find-
ings from smaller studies that certain racial-ethnic minority
groups with severe mental illness have higher prevalence of
diabetes than whites (7). This high diabetes prevalence is
concerning because health care disparities are well docu-
mented for both racial-ethnic minority populations (10)
and populations with severe mental illness (11), making
this subpopulation at especially high risk for disparities in
care (7,8).
Our study confirms prior findings of high prevalence
of diabetes among people with severe mental illness (3).
The standardized and adjusted prevalence of diabetes
among people with severe mental illness taking antipsy-
chotic medications in California was estimated to be 27.3%,

 or about 2.5 times that of
the general U.S. population
(10.2%), according to NHANES
data during that time period
(2009) (4).
The main limitation was
that we could assess preva-
lence only among those who
were tested for diabetes and
who had ICD-9 diabetes di-
agnoses or claims for diabe-
tes medications; thus our
findings may overestimate
true prevalence, primarily be-
cause patients at high suspi-
cion of diabetes are almost
surely preferentially screened.
In contrast, lack of screening
almost certainly leads to
missed cases of diabetes, be-
cause 25%250% of all patients
with type 2 diabetes in the
United States are undiagnosed
(12). Because dually eligible
(Medicaid and Medicare) pa-
tients were excluded, diabetes
prevalence may have been
underestimated. In addition,
we did not have data on anti-
psychotic medication expo-
sure or the timing of exposure
relative to diabetes diagnosis.
Future studies should ex-
amine both diabetes incidence
and prevalence longitudinally
among diverse populations
with severe mental illness
taking antipsychotic medi-
cations. Examining poten-
tial racial-ethnic differences more thoroughly may help stratify
risk levels within certain high-risk subpopulations. Although
accurate understanding of risk is clearly important, recent
findings indicate that use of the U.S. Preventive Services Task
Force screening guidelines identifies diabetes in only about half
of those served in community health centers (13). A large study
should be conducted to systematically screen all people with
severe mental illness served in community mental health set-
tings to obtain an accurate assessment of missed diagnoses.
Culturally and linguistically appropriate integration
models are needed to address the health care needs of mi-
nority populations with severe mental illness. As a first
step, we recommend systemwide efforts to improve di-
abetes screening and care for all people with severe mental
illness, because such efforts can be effective in reducing
disparities. Unfortunately, systemwide efforts are compli-
cated, because the public mental health and general medical
care systems often operate in separate digital, financial, oper-
ational, and structural silos. Many people with severe mental
illness are publicly insured and receive care in community
mental health clinics (14). Therefore, we believe that in-
tegrating primary care into these public mental health set-
tings may improve health screening in this population.
Regrettably, evidence-based models to integrate primary care
into behavioral health care have not yet been developed (15).
CONCLUSIONS
The prevalence of diabetes among people with severe mental
illness taking antipsychotic medications was significantly
higher than in the general population. Racial-ethnic minority
group members with severe mental illness taking antipsychotic
medications had higher prevalence of diabetes compared
with whites. Because racial-ethnic minority populations with
