ABSTRACT
BLAZEVICH, A. J., N. D. GILL, T. KVORNING, A. D. KAY, A. G. GOH, B. HILTON, E. J. DRINKWATER, and D. G. BEHM. No
Effect of Muscle Stretching within a Full, Dynamic Warm-up on Athletic Performance. Med. Sci. Sports Exerc., Vol. 50, No. 6,
pp. 1258–1266, 2018. Purpose: This study aimed to examine the effects of static and dynamic stretching routines performed as
part of a comprehensive warm-up on flexibility and sprint running, jumping, and change of direction tests in team sport athletes.
Methods: A randomized, controlled, crossover study design with experimenter blinding was conducted. On separate days, 20 male
team sport athletes completed a comprehensive warm-up routine. After a low-intensity warm-up, a 5-s static stretch (5S), a 30-s
static stretch (30S; 3 � 10-s stretches), a 5-repetition (per muscle group) dynamic stretch (DYN), or a no-stretch (NS) protocol was completed;
stretches were done on seven lower body and two upper body regions. This was followed by test-specific practice progressing to maximum
intensity. A comprehensive test battery assessing intervention effect expectations as well as flexibility, vertical jump, sprint running, and
change of direction outcomes was then completed in a random order. Results: There were no effects of stretch condition on test perfor-
mances. Before the study, 18/20 participants nominated DYN as the most likely to improve performance and 15/20 nominated NS as least
likely. Immediately before testing, NS was rated less ‘‘effective’’ (4.0 T 2.2 on a 10-point scale) than 5S, 30S, and DYN (5.3–6.4).
Nonetheless, these ratings were not related to test performances. Conclusion: Participants felt they were more likely to perform well when
stretching was performed as part of the warm-up, irrespective of stretch type. However, no effect of muscle stretching was observed on
flexibility and physical function compared with no stretching. On the basis of the current evidence, the inclusion of short durations of either
static or dynamic stretching is unlikely to affect sprint running, jumping, or change of direction performance when performed as part of a
comprehensive physical preparation routine. Key Words: ATHLETIC PREPARATION, SPRINT PERFORMANCE, VERTICAL JUMP,

I
t is believed that the completion of a preexercise (or
presport) physical preparation routine is required to
augment performance and reduce injury risk (1–3). One
component of this routine that has received much scrutiny is
the inclusion of static (particularly passive) muscle stretching
(3–8). From an injury minimization perspective, studies have
typically not confirmed a clear effect of preexercise static
stretching on all-cause injury risk in sports (9,10), which has
resulted in some researchers suggesting a limited role for the
practice (6,7,10) or for the inclusion of dynamic forms of
stretching (2). However, other authors conclude that static
stretching might specifically provide a small-to-moderate
protective effect for muscle–tendon injury risk, especially in
running-based sports (e.g., the various football codes and
court sports) (3,4,8,9), which attract by far the highest par-
ticipation (11) and injury (12) rates. By contrast, no detailed
studies have examined the effects of dynamic stretching on
injury risk. Therefore, current scientific evidence favors static
over dynamic stretching from an injury prevention perspec-
tive, although the overall benefit may be small to moderate
and limited to a subset of sports.
Nonetheless, several recent reviews have also concluded
that static stretching can significantly and negatively affect
high-intensity physical performance (4,5,13). Several re-
searchers and advocacy groups, including the European
College of Sports Sciences (14) and the American College
of Sports Medicine (15), do not recommend the inclusion of
static stretching in preexercise routines or call for its re-
placement by dynamic forms of muscle stretching (2). In-
deed, in some cases, the continued use of static stretching by

 sports participants has been explicitly admonished (16).
Nonetheless, the majority of studies examining the effects of
preexercise muscle stretching have not been designed to
assess its effects on sports performance (e.g., see Supple-
ment G in ref. 4). Common threats to external validity in
previous studies include (a) total stretching durations being
longer than those typically performed by athletes (17,18);
(b) the stretching rarely being followed by other important
components of a sport-specific warm-up, including high-
intensity and movement pattern-specific exercises (1,19),
although it may mitigate the negative effects of stretching
(20); (c) participants being only minimally familiarized with
the tests (athletes, on the other hand, are familiar with their
sporting skills); (d) differences existing in the execution
(movement pattern) of static versus dynamic stretches; and
(e) the imposition of nonstretching rest periods in control
conditions/groups, which would not be performed in sports
(4). Also, studies have been susceptible to serious threats to
internal validity, such as the expectancy effects of knowl-
edgeable participants (21) and lack of experimenter blinding
(22). Notwithstanding these threats to validity, the effects of
static stretching on dynamic movement performance (e.g.,
jumping, running, sprint cycling) have been found to be
small on average when stretches are performed for G60 s per
muscle (weighted average = j1.1%), and the performance
benefits of dynamic stretching performance is also surpris-
ingly small (+1.3%) (4). The call for the removal of static
stretching and possible replacement with dynamic stretching
(16), despite the limited evidence of impact on sports perfor-
mance, creates a dilemma for medical practitioners, physio-
therapists, and physical trainers who may be asked to provide
their opinions on proper sports participation practices.
Given the above, the decision to advocate against the
static stretching, particularly on the grounds that it might reduce
exercise performance, is questionable, especially given that
sports participants show a preference to stretch their muscles
despite this advocacy (23) and there being a potential small-to-
moderate musculotendinous injury risk minimization benefit.
In the present study, we have attempted to overcome some of
the limitations of previous studies to specifically answer the
question of whether the inclusion of short- or moderate-
duration static or dynamic muscle stretching completed as part
of a comprehensive preexercise routine (i.e., warm-up) in-
fluences performances in common, high-intensity sporting
tasks. On the basis of the available evidence, we hypothesized
that the imposition of short or moderate durations of static or
dynamic stretching would not meaningfully affect high-
intensity physical performance when performed as part of a
comprehensive preexercise routine.
METHODS
Twenty healthy males (age = 21.1 T 3.1 yr; body mass =
73.4 T 6.8 kg; height = 1.79 T 0.70 m) volunteered for the
study. Participants were recruited if they were 18–25 yr of
age, without recent injury or illness that would preclude
exercise performance, and competing in running-based
sports or performing at least three running-based exercise
sessions per week. The study was approved by the Human
Research Ethics Committee of Edith Cowan University
(STREAM11450/11541) and conducted in accordance with
the Declaration of Helsinki. All participants read and signed
an informed consent document.
Study Design
This study used a randomized, crossover (repeated-measures)
design with control condition and was designed to assess the
effect of dynamic versus both shorter- (5 s) and longer-
duration (30 s) static muscle stretching interventions on
performances in tests that mimic common sporting tasks.
There were three experimental (stretching) conditions and
a nonstretching control condition (hereafter referred to as
‘‘pretesting routines’’) performed at the same time of day over
four testing sessions separated by a minimum of 72 h and each
followed by a comprehensive test battery (see Fig. 1). The order
of conditions and order of tests within each condition were
randomized between the participants without replication by
the participants choosing a numbered card randomly from a
pack that related to a test and stretch condition order. The card
was not replaced to ensure that some test and stretch condition
orders could not be allocated more often than others.
A pretesting routine was completed before the test battery
was administered. The pretesting routine, including any muscle
stretching, was monitored by a research coordinator who en-
sured that procedures (described below) were followed cor-
rectly but who could not communicate with researchers
overseeing the test battery (hereafter referred to as ‘‘testers’’).
After completion of the pretesting routine, the coordinators
relinquished participant responsibility to the testers, who were
given no information as to the pretesting stretch condition
administered and were naBve to the time required to complete
the pretesting routine; this prevented the possibility of guess-
ing the pretesting routine type because each required a dif-
ferent time to complete. Thus, the testers were blinded to the
pretesting routine condition.
Familiarization of Muscle Stretching and
Performance Tests
At least one familiarization session was completed by each
participant before data collection to become accustomed to the
stretching protocols, to learn the correct testing procedures,
and to acquaint themselves with the equipment, laboratory
facility, and verbal instructions issued by the coordinators and
testers for the stretching exercises and tests. A video demon-
stration of each stretch was provided to the participants to
ensure similarity in instruction of the stretches, then each
participant received individual feedback to correct errors. The
participants were then shown how to complete each test and
given multiple untimed trials to become familiar. The move-
ment patterns of the tests (described below) were similar to the
movement patterns used by the participants in their sports. An

 additional familiarization session was provided to four par-
ticipants who declared a lack of confidence in the performance
of one or more testing protocols.
Prestudy Participant Outcome Expectations
At the end of the familiarization session, each participant
completed an outcome expectation survey to determine which
preexercise routine they believed would prove most beneficial
to performance. The participants were asked to ‘‘List in de-
scending order the stretch condition you believe will stimulate
the best improvement in your performance (dynamic, 5 s
static, 30 s static, and no stretch)’’ when compared with the
other conditions. They therefore nominated in order from 1
(best) to 4 (worst) which routine they believed would improve
(or reduce) performance the most. Post hoc, these expecta-
tions were compared with the outcomes of the testing to de-
termine whether expectation was aligned with outcome.
Testing Session Design
Participants were required to wear the same sports shoes
and athletic clothing at each session, to refrain from inten-
sive exercise in the 24-h period before testing, and to abstain
from caffeine or any form of stimulant/depressant 24 h be-
fore testing. As the participants were team sport athletes,
other physical training completed by the participants outside
of the study was monitored (for type, volume, and intensity)
by the participants providing a log book record of their
activities in the 48 h before testing as well as a rating of their
muscle soreness from 1 to 10 to ensure that significant (92 units)
changes in their performance of, or recovery from, their pro-
grams did not occur. If the standard training programs of the
participants were not adhered to, the testing session was to be
cancelled and completed at least 72 h later; however, no in-
stances of this occurred.
Each session commenced with a short prestretching
warm-up consisting of a 3-min jog at 50% of perceived maxi-
mum exertion, then 5-s high knees (to ~90- hip angle) and 5-s
heel-to-butt (i.e., knee flexion) drills at 50% of maximum
perceived exertion. Heart rate was obtained immediately after
the warm-up phase by manual palpation of the carotid artery
for post hoc examination of the repeatability of efforts; that is,
repeatability of the physical intensities used (heart rate itself
could not be used as a target for intensity because of its slow
temporal response after exercise commencement).
Participants then completed one of three experimental
(stretching) conditions or progressed immediately to the test-
specific (i.e., ‘‘sport-specific’’) warm-up (described below);
note that a rest condition of equal duration to the experi-
mental conditions was not included in the no-stretch (con-
trol) session as this is not typical sports practice. The four
conditions were 5-s static stretch (5S), 30-s static stretch (30S;
3 � 10-s stretches), 5-repetition (per muscle group) dynamic
stretch (DYN), and no-stretch (NS) condition (see Text, Sup-
plemental Digital Content 1, Detailing the instructions [with
photo] for each stretch, http://links.lww.com/MSS/B187). The
FIGURE 1—Study design. After completing a low-intensity warm-up including 3-min jog and running drills, a randomly assigned stretching (no NS
control) condition was completed. This was followed by a high-intensity warm-up comprising further jogging and running drills and then three circuits
at increasing intensity (to maximum) composed of the performance tests. After a 7-min rest, during which time the participants rated their confidence
that the warm-up would improve their performance (see text for details), a sit-and-reach flexibility test was completed before the high-intensity
performance tests were completed in a random order (order repeated at each session). 5-rep, 5-repetition.

 5S, 30S, and DYN stretching protocols each consisted of nine
stretches that were close replicates (in body position) of each
other to minimize the effect of stretching movement pattern
on test outcomes. The static stretches were held at the point of
‘‘discomfort,’’ and maximal ROM was achieved in the dy-
namic stretches by ensuring a secondary pulling motion with
each repetition. The order of preexercise routines was ran-
domized without replication between participants to minimize
order effects.
After the stretches (or after progressing immediately from
the low-intensity warm-up in NS), a test-specific (i.e.,
‘‘sport-specific’’), higher-intensity warm-up was completed.
This started with a 2-min moderate-intensity jog at 60% of
perceived effort, and 5-s high knees and 5-s heel-to-butt kick
drills at 60% of perceived maximum effort. The participants
then performed three circuits of the six performance tests,
which were organized into three activity groups: 1) running
vertical jump; 2) squat jump (SJ), countermovement jump
(CMJ), and drop jump (DJ); 3) T agility test; and 4) 20-m
sprint run, and the participants completed them in an or-
der identical to that of the following testing session (see
below). The intensity of each circuit increased from 60%
to 80% and then 100% of perceived maximal exertion
with a 30-s walk recovery between each activity set. This
second part of the pretesting routine took approximately 15 min
to complete.
To address the study design limitation relating to the time
between completion of the final stretch and the commence-
ment of testing (4), a 7-min passive rest period was imposed
between the completion of the pretesting routine and the start
of testing. This was done to more closely simulate game- or
match-day situations where a short precompetition brief-
ing or an individual-specific sport preparation period is
completed before match or competition commencement
and allowed a better determination of the likely effect of
the different preexercise routines on game- or match-day
performance.
Participants were permitted to consume plain water ad libitum
throughout the testing sessions, and all sessions were conducted
in the biomechanics laboratory at Edith Cowan University
under similar environmental conditions. The test battery was
completed in a circuit at specified testing stations: 1) sit-and-
reach flexibility test; 2) running vertical jump test; 3) SJ, CMJ,
and DJ (from a 40-cm height) tests; 4) T agility test; and 5)
20-m sprint running test. The order of tests was randomized
between participants without replication and then repeated
at each session; however, the sit-and-reach test was always
completed first to determine the effect of the pretesting routine
on flexibility (maximum range of motion) without the poten-
tial influence of other tests. The performance of the sit-and-
reach test was not expected to influence performances in
subsequent tests because of the short duration of the stretch
procedure. For the testing, 4 min was allocated to each test
station so that constant test timing was achieved regardless of
the order of tests. An audio signal prompted the commence-
ment of each test.
Post–Warm-up Participant Outcome Expectations
To address issues around expectancy bias (21), during the
7-min rest period before testing in each session, the partici-
pants also provided a rating score ranging from 1 to 10 for
‘‘how effective you believe the warm-up will be on your
performance,’’ where 1 = no effect/possibly harmful to
performance, 2 = very small improvement to performance,
5 = noticeable improvement in performance, and 10 = per-
formance will improve dramatically. Obtaining this informa-
tion immediately after completion of each pretesting routine
was expected to yield different results to the outcome expec-
tation survey completed in the study familiarization session
and, thus, to allow a better analysis of whether participant
expectancy might influence study results. Equal ratings be-
tween conditions were allowed.
Testing Procedures
Sit-and-reach flexibility. The sit-and-reach test was
conducted using the Flex-Tester apparatus (Novel Products
Inc., Rockton, IL). A double-leg protocol was used as pre-
scribed by the Canadian Society for Exercise Physiology
(24). Each participant was instructed to sit bare-footed with
knees in maximal extension and with both feet together and
flat against the device. The participant then exhaled and
stretched forward with palms overlapping and fingertips
aligned, holding the furthest end point for 2 s. The score was
recorded to the nearest 0.1 cm and repeated after a 30-s rest,
with the greatest touch distance used for analysis.
Three-meter running vertical jump. A jump-and-
reach
system
(Vertec;
Swift
Performance
Equipment,
Wacol, Australia) was used for the running vertical jump to
directly measure jump height based on the difference be-
tween the reach height and the jump height obtained. Reach
height was obtained before each test with the participant
standing in a static position underneath the Vertec device
and reaching as high as possible with the arm touching their
ear but with shoulders remaining parallel to the floor. The
fingers displaced vanes (each 1 cm apart) within touching
distance, and the maximum reach height was obtained. For
jump testing, each participant_s takeoff foot was predetermined
during the familiarization session, and a self-selected starting
position was assumed 3 m from the device, which was kept
consistent across all testing sessions. At their own volition, the
participant executed a running, single-leg jump to displace the
vanes with the opposite hand. The maximum jump-and-reach
height was recorded as the number below the score reflected
on the Vertec device, and the true jump height was then cal-
culated as the difference between the maximum jump-and-
reach height and the standing reach height. Each participant
was given a maximum of five attempts; however, the test was
stopped when the participant failed to further improve jump
scores on two successive attempts. A 30-s passive rest was
imposed between each jump, and the best (i.e., final) true jump
height score was used for analysis.

 SJ, CMJ, and DJ. A piezoelectric force platform
(987B, Kistler Instrumente, Winterthur, Switzerland) was
used to measure vertical jump height using the flight time
method (height = 2 g (t/2)2, where g = 9.81 mIsj2 and t =
time in air). The analog signal from the force platform was
converted to a digital signal using Bioware software (Kistler
Instrumente) sampling at 1000 Hz. Flight time was identi-
fied as the period between takeoff and contact after flight,
and this was obtained in each jump via analysis of the force–
time curve. A 15-s passive recovery was imposed between
each jump, which allowed the tester to record vertical jump
height and to reset the systems for recording of the next trial.
Two attempts were allowed for each jump type; however, a
third trial was completed if jump heights varied 95%. The
best score was used for analysis.
SJ trials were performed from a squatted position with
heels in contact with the platform and with a self-selected
knee angle (~75-). Each participant_s hands were kept on
their hips throughout the jump, and a countermovement was
not allowed. The participant was instructed to hold the squat
position for at least 2 s before jumping. Visual observation
of both jumping technique and the force–time trace was
made to ensure that there was no countermovement in the
jump. Trials were repeated if a countermovement could be
visually observed by the tester. CMJ trials were performed
from a vertical standing position with hands on hips and
knees about shoulder width apart. The participants then ex-
ecuted a two-footed vertical jump immediately after an ec-
centric countermovement to a self-selected depth (although
the thighs could not be lower than parallel to the floor [19]).
In the DJ, the participant stepped horizontally off a 40-cm
box onto the force platform and then immediately jumped
vertically. The instruction was given to ‘‘jump with minimal
ground contact time upon landing’’ and then to jump as high
as possible. The starting position on the top of the box was
identical with the CMJ start position.
T agility test. For the T agility (change of direction) test,
participants started at their own volition from a standing start
0.4 m behind a start line, sprinted forward to touch the base
of a cone located 10 m in front of them, shuffled 5 m to the
left to touch a cone, shuffled 10 m to the right to touch a
cone, shuffled 5 m left to touch the center cone once again,
and then ran backward past the start line. A dual-beam
photocell timing gate (Swift Performance) positioned at the
start line was triggered when the participant broke the light
beam after the start and was stopped when the participant
completed the course. Each athlete faced forward at all times
and could not cross their feet while shuffling. The partici-
pants were instructed to use a standing sprint start and were
not allowed to build momentum by rocking back and forth at
the start line. They performed the test twice with a 30-s passive
rest between, and the fastest time was used for analysis.
Twenty-meter sprint run. The 20-m sprint test was
performed on an indoor synthetic 60-m sprint track. The
participants used the same starting position as for the T agility
test and ran with maximum speed to a cone placed 1.5 m past
a 20-m mark. This cone was included to prevent the partici-
pants from decelerating before crossing the 20-m mark. The
tester counted down and then instructed the participants to
sprint at their own volition, and timing gates were placed at
0 and 20 m measured running time. Two attempts were given
with a 30-s walk-back recovery between attempts, and the
fastest time was used for analysis.
Statistical Analysis
Using IBM SPSS statistical software (version 22; IBM,
New York, NY), repeated-measures MANOVA was performed
to compare test performances between conditions (5S, 30S,
DYN, and NS), whereas a repeated-measures ANOVA was
used to compare the performances between conditions spe-
cifically for sit-and-reach scores. The alpha level was set at
0.05, and significant main or interaction effects were exam-
ined in further detail using ANOVA and univariate tests, as
appropriate. In addition, magnitude-based inference tests were
performed, and the precision of estimation was calculated.
Qualitative descriptors of standardized effects used the fol-
lowing criteria: trivial G0.2, small 0.2–0.6, moderate 0.6–1.2,
and large 91.2. Effects where the 95% confidence limits
substantially overlapped the thresholds for small positive and
negative effects (i.e., exceeding 0.2 of the SD on both sides of
zero) were defined as unclear. Clear small or larger effect sizes
(i.e., those with 975% likelihood of being 90.20), as calcu-
lated using the spread sheet developed by Hopkins (25), were
defined as definitive. Precision of estimates was indicated with
95% confidence limits, which defined the range representing
the uncertainty in the true value of the (unknown) population
mean (26). To better assess the similarity (or lack) of perfor-
mances between trials, both Pearson_s correlation (r) and
intraclass correlation (ICC) were calculated; no corrections
were required for outliers or nonuniformity of scatter. ICC
values G0.5, 0.5–0.75, 0.75–0.9, and 90.90 were considered
indicative of poor, moderate, good, and excellent reliability,
respectively. The 90% confidence interval (CI) values were
also computed for ICC values, but this is not possible for
r values calculated from multiple repeated measurements.
Finally, the Bland–Altman method for calculating correlation
coefficients for repeated measurements (within subjects) was
used to determine whether higher participant expectation
scores were correlated with better performances (27).
RESULTS
Participant bias. When assessed during the familiari-
zation session (i.e., before the commencement of the data col-
lection period), 18 of the 20 participants nominated DYN as the
most likely beneficial pretesting routine (i.e., they ranked it first
out of the four conditions), whereas two participants nominated
30S as the most likely beneficial. In addition, 15 of the 20 par-
ticipants nominated NS to be least likely beneficial (i.e., ranked it
fourth out of the four conditions), whereas five participants
nominated 30S. The commonest ranking order among the

 participants was DYN 9 5S 9 30S 9 NS. Thus, there was a
clear a priori bias within the participant group.
When asked upon completion of each pretesting routine to
rate (on a scale of 1–10) how effective they believed the
routine would be for their performance, NS was rated con-
sistently worst (4.0 T 2.2), and 5S (5.7 T 1.9) and DYN (6.4 T
1.6) were rated statistically higher (P G 0.05) than NS; a ten-
dency toward a greater rating for 30S (5.3 T 2.3) did not reach
statistical significance. No statistical differences were ob-
served between the three stretching conditions, and using
magnitude-based inference, it was found that all three stretch
conditions were rated definitively (975%) higher by partici-
pants than the NS condition, with 97%, 87%, and 100%
likelihoods of 5S, 30S, and DYN, respectively, being per-
ceived of greater benefit than NS. Nonetheless, correlation
coefficients computed for repeated measurements (within
subjects) were small, ranging from j0.16 to 0.21 and with
explained variance (R2) ranging from 0.1% to 4.5%, indicat-
ing a lack of relationship between ratings of perceived benefit
and performance outcomes.

conditions for the 3-m running vertical jump, SJ, CMJ, or DJ
tests (P = 0.471 for condition–time interaction; see Fig. 2),
indicating a lack of effect of pretesting routine on perfor-
mance, and no statistical difference was detected between
sessions 1 and 4, indicating a lack of order effect (i.e., effect of
session number irrespective of condition). All three stretch
conditions were definitively (975% likelihood) found to elicit
trivial effects on running vertical jump (95%, 92%, and 86%
likelihood of trivial effect for 5S, 30S, and DYN, respectively)
and CMJ (97%, 89%, and 95% likelihood of trivial effect)
performances when compared with NS. The effects on SJ
(44%, 65%, and 74% likelihood of trivial effect) and DJ scores
(72%, 38%, and 50% likelihood of trivial effect) were less
clear in SJ (56%, 32%, and 22% likelihood of higher jump in
5S, 30S, and DYN, respectively) and DJ (7%, 62%, and 50%
likelihood of lower jump).
No statistical differences were detected between condi-
tions for the 20-m sprint run (P = 0.354 for condition–time
interaction) or T agility test (P = 0.996; see Fig. 3), indi-
cating a lack of effect of pretesting routine on performances.
Furthermore, no differences were detected between sessions
1 and 4, indicating a lack of order effect. All three stretch
conditions were found to definitively (975%) elicit trivial

were no differences in jump test performances between the conditions. Shown are the mean T SE (black column with error bar) and 95% CI of the
mean (separate gray bar) jump performances.

 effects on 20-m sprint run time (88%, 86%, and 91% like-
lihoods of trivial effect for 5S, 30S, and DYN, respectively)
and T agility time (84%, 93%, and 75% likelihood of trivial
effect) when compared with NS.
No statistical differences were detected for sit-and-reach
scores (P = 0.076 for condition–time interaction) between
5S (27.1 T 8.9 cm), 30S (27.8 T 8.8 cm), DYN (28.4 T 8.36 cm),
and NS (28.9 T 9.2 cm). A definitively trivial effect of con-
dition was observed for DYN (98% likelihood of trivial effect)
when compared with NS, but 45% and 31% likelihoods of
trivial effects for 5S and 30S, with 55% and 68% likelihoods
of lower sit-and-reach scores, were observed in these condi-
tions when compared with NS.
Reliability analysis. Both Pearson_s correlation (r) and
ICC (T90% CI) analyses completed on the test data revealed
a high between-session repeatability of performances for SJ
(r = 0.87; ICC = 0.84 [0.73–0.92]), CMJ (r = 0.90; ICC =
0.92 [0.83–0.95]), DJ (r = 0.88; ICC = 0.87 [0.78–0.93]), 3-step
jump (r = 0.92; ICC = 0.92 [0.85–0.96]), and 20-m sprint
running (r = 0.93; ICC = 0.92 [0.87–0.96]) tests despite the
different stretching interventions being imposed. Reliability
estimates were slightly lower, but still moderate, for the
T agility test (r = 0.70; ICC = 0.71[0.54–0.84]).
Pretesting routine intensities. Heart rates measured
immediately upon completion of the low-intensity jogging
bouts during the pretesting routine were not different be-
tween conditions. The heart rates after the 3-min jog at 50%
of perceived maximum exertion (before the stretching) and
after the 2-min jog at 60% of perceived exertion (after the
stretching) were 125 T 4 and 139 T 19 bpm, respectively.
DISCUSSION
The main finding of the present study was that the inclu-
sion of a period of either static (passive) or dynamic stretching
within a comprehensive preexercise physical preparation
routine (i.e., a ‘‘warm-up’’) did not detectibly influence flexi-
bility or maximal vertical jump, sprint running acceleration, or
change of direction (T agility) test performances compared
with NS control condition. In fact, intersession test reliability
coefficients were good to excellent for 3-m running, SJ, CMJ,
and DJ (ICC = 0.87–0.92) and 20-m sprint running (ICC =
0.93) tests, and moderate (ICC = 0.71) for the T agility test,
despite the stretching component of the warm-up differing
between sessions. On the basis of these results, athletic in-
dividuals who are well familiarized with the physical perfor-
mance tasks and who complete a properly structured warm-up
period (e.g., [1]) may not experience alterations in perfor-
mance when short- or moderate-duration muscle stretching
interventions are included within the warm-up period. The
participants showed a clear bias in their beliefs with regard to
the effects of stretching in the warm-up routine, with 90%
(18/20) of participants expecting performances to be better
after inclusion of a dynamic stretching period when asked to
‘‘list in descending order the stretch condition you believe
will stimulate the best improvement in your performance.’’
This might result from participants having knowledge of
sports science research, either as a university-level student or
as an interested reader. It may also have influenced percep-
tions of preparedness for high-intensity physical activity after
the warm-up period, with participants scoring 6.4 T 1.6 on a
1–10 scale after a warm-up incorporating dynamic stretching
when asked to rate ‘‘how effective you believe the warm-up
will be on your performance’’ (1 = no effect/possibly harmful,
5 = noticeable improvement in performance, 10 = perfor-
mance will improve dramatically). Nonetheless, no statistical
difference was observed between ratings after any stretching
condition, and warm-up routines incorporating 5-s static, 30-s
static, or dynamic stretching were 97%, 87%, and 100%
likely to be perceived of greater benefit than when no
stretching was allowed. Furthermore, correlation coefficients
(computed for repeated measurements within subjects [27])
were small (R2 = 0.1%–4.5%), indicating a lack of relation-
ship. These data differ slightly from those presented recently
by Janes et al. (21), where improvements in knee extensor,
although not knee flexor, strength were observed after static
stretching in participants who were told that the stretching
should improve performance (i.e., there was an expectancy
effect). We conclude that the participants felt as though the
warm-up period prepared them better for high-intensity ex-
ercise performance when stretching was performed, irrespective
of the type of stretching, than when no stretching was allowed.
Although such beliefs did not meaningfully influence test
performances in the present study, participants might theo-
retically perform better in a competitive sport environment
when their perceptions of preparedness are higher, and this
might be examined in future studies.
The current results, that static (passive) muscle stretching
did not compromise, and dynamic stretching did not en-
hance, high-intensity exercise performance (Figs. 2 and 3),
appear to contradict the consensus findings of previous re-
search. However, several previous studies have shown a lack
of effect of muscle stretching on high-intensity exercise per-
formance when comprehensive warm-ups were performed.
Taylor et al. (20) found no differences in vertical jump or
20-m sprint performances after a progressive, skill-based
warm-up in high-level netball athletes despite performance
decrements being observed immediately after a preceding
static stretch period (VJ = j4.2% and 20-m sprint = j1.4%).
In professional (English Premier League) soccer players,
Little and Williams (28) observed no differences in 20-m
sprint time or CMJ height after static or dynamic stretching,
although a statistically faster zigzag agility (change of direc-
tion) performance after dynamic stretching, when the
stretching was performed as part of a full warm-up session
(notably, 20-m sprint performance was improved in both
static and dynamic stretch conditions). Also, Samson et al.
(19) found no differences in rapid kicking, CMJ, or 20-m
sprint test performances between static and dynamic stretch
conditions when performed alongside general and specific
warm-up activities in recreational and competitive athletes.
Such outcomes are not always observed when a warm-up

 opportunity is provided, however. Static stretching has resulted
in decrements in high-intensity exercise performances when the
sport-specific warm-ups were brief (e.g., 2 � 50-m sprints [29])
or of moderate duration and/or intensity (e.g., 10-m high knees,
sidestepping, carioca, skipping, and 20-m zigzag run [30,31]).
When considered together, the available evidence indicates
that muscle stretching does not influence high-intensity exer-
cise test performances when they are followed by a warm-up
period of sufficient duration and incorporating exercises
performed at high (or maximal) intensities. Such warm-up
periods have been endorsed for the improvement of sports
performance and reduction in musculoskeletal injury risk,
even when static stretching is incorporated (3,32).
It is of practical importance that static or dynamic
stretching early in the warm-up did not improve flexibility
more than warm-up alone, as measured by a maximal sit-
and-reach test. Time constraints did not allow for the spe-
cific testing of ranges of motion at different joints; however,
a single multijoint test was expected to reveal changes given
that nine different stretches were performed. The lack of
change in sit-and-reach distance indicated that any effect
of a stretch condition within the warm-up on maximal range
of motion was negligible, which is in agreement with pre-
vious evidence (33). Thus, the dynamic warm-up activities
may have elicited improvements in maximal range of mo-
tion that were not improved upon by the performance of
further stretching, as has been observed previously (34,35).
Alternatively, changes may have occurred in muscles other
than those in the lower back and hamstrings and did not
meaningfully affect sit-and-reach performance. Although it
cannot be excluded that the addition of muscle stretching to
a warm-up routine might improve maximal range of motion
at specific joints, especially if longer or more intense stretch
periods are practiced (36), the present results indicate that
stretching provided negligible flexibility benefit in addition to
the low- and high-intensity dynamic activities (i.e., high knees,
butt kicks, and test practice) of the warm-up. It would be of
interest to determine whether the stretching protocols evoked
changes in muscle–tendon stiffness (extensibility) as opposed
to maximum length (range of motion), as these have been shown
to be differentially influenced by warm-up and stretching (36).
Nonetheless, any possible effects in the current study were
clearly insufficient to affect physical performance.
Steps were taken in the current study to improve both the
external and the internal validity of the results. With respect
to external validity, we accepted only participants who
competed in running-based sports or performed at least three
running-based exercise sessions per week and then allowed
time for extensive familiarization of the tests. We also used
stretching durations that are common in athlete populations
(17,18), ensured that the static and dynamic stretch move-
ment patterns were identical, did not allow a passive rest
condition in the nonstretch condition, and imposed a 7-min
no-activity period after the completion of the full warm-up
period. These steps were taken to replicate as closely as pos-
sible what might occur in the sporting environment. With
respect to internal validity, we ensured that the researchers
who conducted the tests were blinded to the warm-up condi-
tions completed by the participants (although these were
closely supervised by another researcher), and all instructions
were scripted so that they were identical on each test occasion;
the stretch maneuvers were also shown by video with written
instructions so that variations in instruction were minimized. It
was not possible to recruit participants who lacked prior
knowledge of the potential effects of stretching. However, by
assessing participant beliefs before the study as well as after
the completion of each warm-up condition, we were able to
examine relationships between participant expectation and
study outcomes. Together, these steps will have reduced both
experimenter and participant bias, allowing us to more confi-
dently accept the study outcomes. It should be acknowledged,
however, that the study was not designed to examine the
effects of prolonged periods of static (passive) stretching
performed immediately before a physical task, as might be
reflective of practice in some rehabilitation and resistance
training settings.
One potential limitation of the current study design is that
the tests were conducted in a circuit, with 4 min being
allowed for the completion of each test block (i.e., 3-m
running jump; SJ, CMJ, and DJ; 20-m sprint run; and
T agility test). Therefore, the final test on any test day may
have commenced up to 12 min after the commencement of
the test battery, and it will have been performed after several
other maximal-intensity tests. It can then be questioned
whether tests performed closer to the end of the warm-up
period might have been more strongly influenced by the
interventions. However, our analysis did not reveal any ev-
idence of an order effect of the tests, so performances
achieved when a test was first in the circuit (immediately
after the 7-min imposed rest) were not different to those
when the same test was completed at another time point. On
the basis of this evidence, it appears that the (lack of) effect
of the stretching is consistent when a full warm-up is com-
pleted and a short post–warm-up rest is imposed regardless
of the time elapsed or the number of other tests performed in
the intervening period.
CONCLUSIONS
The results of the present randomized, controlled, cross-
over trial indicate that neither short- or moderate-duration
static (passive) nor dynamic muscle stretching influence
flexibility or high-intensity running, jumping, or change of
direction (agility) performances in young, athletic individuals
who perform a complete, progressive preexercise warm-up
routine. However, the incorporation of static (passive) or dy-
namic stretching into a warm-up routine allowed for in-
dividuals to feel more confident of high performance in the
ensuing sports-related tests; that is, there was a psychological
effect. On the basis of the present results and previous findings of
small-to-moderate reductions in muscle injury risk in running-
based sports, we conclude that short- or moderate-duration static

 stretching should be allowed, or even promoted, as part of the
warm-up routine before sports participation. According to our
results, dynamic stretching practices may also be incorporated
into the warm-up routine, although it should be reminded that
no data currently exist documenting the influence of dynamic
stretching on injury risk.
