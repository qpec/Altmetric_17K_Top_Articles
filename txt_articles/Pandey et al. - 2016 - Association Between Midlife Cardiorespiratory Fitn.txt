troke remains one of the leading causes of morbidity and 
mortality. In the United States, stroke remains the third 
leading cause of death and a common reason for hospitaliza-
tion, accounting for >$28 billion in direct medical costs annu-
ally.1 Several previous studies have demonstrated an inverse 
relationship between cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) and both 
fatal and nonfatal stroke.2–6 However, the mechanism by which 
higher levels of CRF might lower stroke risk have not been 
well established, and it remains uncertain to what extent there 
may be a direct effect of CRF on stroke risk, independent of 
established stroke risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes 
mellitus (DM), and atrial fibrillation (AF).7–10 Although previ-
ous studies evaluating the relationship between CRF/physical 
activity and risk of stroke adjust for the baseline risk fac-
tors,3–7,11 they do not allow for the adjustment for subsequent, 
downstream risk factors acquired after CRF/physical activity 
measurement. Against this background, we linked the Cooper 
Center Longitudinal Study (CCLS) with individual claims 
data from the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services 
(CMS) to better characterize the association between midlife 
CRF and stroke risk at a later age. We sought to account for 
the influence of baseline and subsequent, Medicare-defined 
risk factors such as hypertension, DM, and AF on these asso-
ciations. We hypothesized that higher midlife CRF would be 
associated with a lower stroke risk independent of these estab-
lished stroke risk factors.
Methods
From 1970 to 2009, 73 439 participants in the CCLS underwent a 
full examination at the Cooper Clinic in Dallas, TX. Of these, 24 696 
Background and Purpose—Low cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) is associated with an increased risk of stroke. However, 
the extent to which this association is explained by the development of stroke risk factors such as diabetes mellitus, 
hypertension, and atrial fibrillation is unknown. We evaluated the relationship between midlife CRF and risk of stroke 
after the age of 65 years, independent of the antecedent risk factor burden.
Methods—Linking participant data from the Cooper Center Longitudinal Study with Medicare claims files, we studied 
19 815 individuals who survived to receive Medicare coverage from 1999 to 2009. CRF estimated at baseline by Balke 
treadmill time was analyzed as a continuous variable (in metabolic equivalents) and according to age- and sex-specific 
quintiles (Q1=low CRF). Associations between midlife CRF and stroke hospitalization after the age of 65 years were 
assessed by applying a proportional hazards recurrent events model to the failure time data with hypertension, diabetes 
mellitus, and atrial fibrillation as time-dependent covariates.
Results—After 129 436 person-years of Medicare follow-up, we observed 808 stroke hospitalizations. After adjustment 
for baseline risk factors, higher midlife CRF was associated with a lower risk of stroke hospitalization (hazard ratio 
[HR], 0.61; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.49–0.76; quintiles 4–5 versus 1]. This association remained unchanged after 
additional adjustment for burden of Medicare-identified stroke risk factors (hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and atrial 
fibrillation; HR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.51–0.79; quintiles 4–5 versus 1).
Conclusions—There is a strong, inverse association between midlife CRF and stroke risk in later life independent of baseline 
and antecedent burden of risk factors, such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and atrial fibrillation.

participants with complete baseline data available and no history 
of stroke were eligible to receive Medicare coverage from 1999 to 
2009. From this cohort, we excluded 4010 participants lacking tra-
ditional Medicare Fee-for-Service coverage, 49 participants with 
early Medicare benefits (age, <65 years because of Medicare cover-
age for disability, end-stage renal disease, etc), and 822 individuals 
whose CCLS examination occurred after enrollment into Medicare 
Fee-for-Service. The final study sample included 19 815 participants. 
Participants were followed up from the date of initiating Medicare 
coverage or 1999 (if already receiving Medicare coverage before 
1999) until death or end of follow-up on December 31, 2009. No 
individual was excluded based on his or her performance on the exer-
cise treadmill portion of the examination.
CCLS Clinical Examination
Details of the clinical examination and the study cohort have been 
published previously.12,13 CCLS participants undergo a comprehen-
sive clinical examination that includes a self-reported personal and 
family history, fasting blood levels of total cholesterol, glucose, and 
a maximal treadmill exercise test. Body mass index was calculated 
from measured height and weight. Seated resting blood pressure was 
obtained with a mercury sphygmomanometer. Fasting venous blood 
was assayed for serum cholesterol and glucose using standardized, 
automated techniques.
CRF was measured in the CCLS by a symptom-limited maxi-
mal treadmill exercise test using a Balke protocol as detailed in the 
Methods in the online-only Data Supplement. The test time using this 
protocol has been shown to strongly correlate with directly measured 
maximal oxygen uptake (R=0.92).14,15
After standardized analysis of CRF data,12,13 treadmill times were 
compared with age- and sex-specific normative data on treadmill 
performance within the CCLS, allowing each individual’s treadmill 
time to be categorized into an age- and sex-specific quintile of CRF. 
These quintiles of CRF measures were then combined into 3, mutu-
ally exclusive fitness groupings: quintile 1: low fitness; quintiles 2 
to 3: intermediate fitness; quintiles 4 to 5: high fitness. Furthermore, 
using well-established regression equations, treadmill times from the 
Balke protocol allow for estimation of CRF level in metabolic equiva-
lents (METs).14,16,17
Medicare Claims Data
Medicare inpatient claims data were obtained from the CMS for 
CCLS participants who were ≥65 years of age and who were eli-
gible for Medicare Fee-for-Service benefits from 1999—the first year 
CMS data are currently available for public use—to 2009. CMS data 
contain 100% of claims paid by Medicare for covered healthcare 
services. This enables participants to be tracked over time to elicit a 
history of all healthcare services utilized. Additional inpatient hospi-
talization files from CMS provide complete records for medical ser-
vices billed to Medicare, the date of service, primary diagnosis with 
≤8 secondary diagnoses (ie, International Classification of Diseases-
Ninth Revision code), beneficiary demographic information, and 
other numerous data.
Stroke hospitalization was defined when listed as the primary 
diagnosis upon hospital discharge as indicated by International 
Classification of Diseases-Ninth Revision codes 430, 431, 433.x1, 
434.x1, and 436. Previous work has demonstrated that when these 
codes are listed as the primary diagnosis, they have a positive predic-
tive value of 92% to 100%.18–22 The presence of comorbidities, such 
as hypertension, DM, and AF on follow-up was also determined using 
data from CMS using a previously described methodology (Methods 
in the online-only Data Supplement).16,23
Statistical Analyses
Because patients enter the Medicare claims data at various ages and 
for varying durations, the data are subject to censoring on the right 
and left, with possibility of multiple events per patients. Therefore, 
we estimated the intensity of recurrent events using the conditional 
model of Prentice, Williams, and Peterson (PWP model).24 Briefly, 
this conditional modeling approach allows us to model the hazard 
function for outcome event beyond a participants’ first event to sec-
ond and subsequent events. It assumes that a participant is not at risk 
for (n+1)th event until the nth event has occurred. This produces a 
proportional hazard model with time-dependent strata, where the 
dependence between event times in handled by the previous number 
of failures.25,26 For the present analysis, we used the PWP total time 
model with time for each event starting at the baseline and attained 
age as the dependent variable. The outcome event of interest is stroke 
hospitalization and the at-risk population is stratified by the number 
of stroke hospitalizations. Consistent with our analytic approach in 
previous studies from this cohort,16,23 multiple stroke events within a 
30-day time interval for a participant were counted as a single event 
to account for repeat hospitalizations that may be related to a single 
index event. At the time a patient develops stroke hospitalization, 
they advance to the next at-risk stratum. Because only 17 partici-
pants had >2 events, the model used in the present analysis included 
only 2 strata: one for initial events, and the other for truly recurrent 
events. The presence of comorbidity (hypertension, DM, and AF) was 
defined when a particular condition, based on its respective afore-
mentioned definitions, was noted before or within 365 days after a 
study participant’s first stroke hospitalization.

Unadjusted stroke hospitalization rates were analyzed separately 
for men and women according to CRF quintile. Risk of first stroke 
related hospitalization was also compared across different midlife 
CRF categories using the Breslow survival estimates curves for the 
overall population and the sex-specific subgroups. Multivariable-
adjusted association between midlife CRF and stroke hospitalization 
was characterized according to the aforementioned mutually exclu-
sive CRF groupings by applying a proportional hazards recurrent 
events model to the failure time data in 2 separate models: model 1 
adjusted for age, sex, prevalent cardiovascular risk factors at baseline 
examination (body mass index, baseline DM [self-reported or fasting 
glucose >126 mg/dL, yes/no], total cholesterol, systolic blood pres-
sure, and smoking [yes/no]), and age difference between the first and 
recurrent stroke events; model 2 adjusted for the variables listed in the 
model 1 and presence of hypertension, DM and AF observed during 
Medicare follow-up as time-dependent covariates. This was done to 
assess the evidence for a direct effect of CRF on risk of stroke that 
is not explained by interval development of these intermediate risks. 
The proportional hazards assumption was confirmed by testing for 
linear interactions between covariates and the age during follow-up. 
Similar analyses were also performed with midlife CRF measured as 
a continuous variable (METs). In all analyses, death obtained from 
Medicare claims files was treated as a censoring event. All statistical 
analyses were performed using SAS for Windows (release 9.2; SAS 
Institute, Inc, Cary, NC).
Results
Our study population had a low baseline prevalence of tradi-
tional risk factors at the time of entry into the CCLS (Table 1). 
Seventy-nine percent of the study participants were men and 
almost the entire study population was white (98.3%). In both 
men and women, higher levels of CRF were associated with 
lower levels of traditional cardiovascular risk factors.
After 129 436 person-years of Medicare follow-up, we 
observed 808 stroke hospitalizations in the study population 
with higher event rate in men than in women (Table 2). There 
were significant differences in the observed stroke hospitaliza-
tion rates among the study participants according to the base-
line CRF levels. Compared with low-fit participants (quintile 
1), moderate- (quintile 2–3) and high-fit participants (quintiles 
4–5) had a lower risk of stroke hospitalization in the overall 
population (Figure 1) as well as among men and women sepa-
rately (Table 2; Figure I in the online-only Data Supplement). 
When stroke hospitalization rates were further stratified by 
METs achieved during maximal treadmill exercise test, a lin-
ear dose-dependent inverse relationship was observed for both 
men and women (Figure 2).
After adjustment for traditional cardiovascular risk fac-
tors measured at baseline examination, higher midlife CRF 
was associated with a lower risk for stroke hospitalization 
(Table 3, model 1). After adjustment for both traditional 
risk factors and the presence of hypertension, DM, and AF 
at Medicare follow-up, the association between CRF and 
risk of stroke hospitalization remained unchanged (Table 3, 
model 2). On continuous analyses, 1-MET higher midlife

CRF was associated with 7% reduction in risk for stroke 
hospitalization (hazard ratio, 0.93; 95% confidence interval 
0.98–0.97 per MET). The presence of hypertension and AF 
at Medicare follow-up was independently associated with 
a higher risk of stroke hospitalization (Table 3, model 2). 
In contrast, the presence of DM after the age of 65 years 
was not associated with increased risk of stroke in the most 
adjusted model (Table 3, model 2). There was no significant 
statistical interaction between baseline fitness and sex for the 
risk of stroke hospitalization on follow-up, and the associa-
tion between CRF levels and stroke risk was not different 
between men and women (Table I in the online-only Data 
Supplement).
Discussion
In the present study, we observed 2 important findings. First, in 
a cohort with a low baseline prevalence of traditional risk fac-
tors, there was a dose-dependent inverse association between 
midlife CRF and risk of stroke later in life. Second, the inverse 
association between midlife CRF and risk of stroke was inde-
pendent of the risk factor burden (hypertension, DM, and 
AF) observed on Medicare follow-up. Taken together, these 
findings highlight the importance of increased exercise and 
physical activity in midlife as a potential strategy for stroke 
risk reduction in older age.
Previous studies have evaluated the association between 
physical activity, CRF, and stroke.2–7 The relationship between 
physical activity and stroke risk has been shown to be inconsis-
tent in published literature, with several studies demonstrating 
a nonlinear relationship between physical activity and stroke, 
whereas others reporting a dose-dependent inverse relation-
ship.6,11,27 Furthermore, physical activity has been shown to be 
a less robust predictor of stroke risk than CRF, likely because 
of the limitations associated with self-reported measure of 
physical activity.28
Among studies evaluating association between objec-
tive CRF measurement and stroke risk, the 2 earliest stud-
ies only included men and had limited assessments of stroke 
outcomes.3,4 A previous study from The Cooper Institute also 
examined the association between CRF and fatal/nonfatal 
stroke in both men and women.2 However, this study was lim-
ited by the use of self-reported outcome measure for nonfatal 
stroke. The present study with 19 815 healthy participants, 
objectively measured CRF levels at middle age, and objective

assessment of stroke events using administrative data repre-
sents a substantial contribution to the existing literature. We 
observed a graded, dose–response relationship between mea-
sured CRF and stroke hospitalization in both men and women. 
In contrast to the previous study from The Cooper Institute 
using self-reported stroke outcomes,2 we observe no appar-
ent threshold effect in the association between higher CRF 
and lower stroke hospitalization risk. Our data and a previ-
ous meta-analysis looking at physical activity and stroke risk29 
suggest no apparent limit to the protective effects of CRF on 
long-term stroke risk.
The mechanisms through which higher fitness in midlife 
may protect against stroke risk are not well established. One 
potential pathway for this observed association is through 
a favorable impact of higher midlife fitness on downstream 
development of stroke risk factors such as hypertension, DM, 
and AF. In the present study, we observed that the associa-
tion between midlife CRF and risk of stroke was only mini-
mally attenuated after additional adjustment for the risk factor 
(hypertension, DM, and AF) burden on follow-up. These 
findings suggest that the inverse association between CRF in 
midlife and risk of stroke at a later age may be related to a 
more direct effect of fitness on other mediators of stroke such 
as carotid atheroma burden, arterial stiffness, neuroprotective 
factors, and endothelial dysfunction.30–33
Our findings have important potential clinical implica-
tions. Regular exercise has previously been associated with 
reduction in blood pressure, decreased insulin resistance, 
and lower heart rates.34 Our study findings highlight the role 
of regular exercise and higher CRF in midlife as a potential 
stroke prevention strategy. This protective effect of higher 
CRF seems to go beyond risk factors modification. Previous 
research has suggested that exercise training and higher CRF 
impacts carotid artery distensibility, nitric oxide availabil-
ity, improving endothelial dysfunction, and thereby affect-
ing conduit arteries and peripheral microcirculation.33 It has 
been suggested that this heightened systemic endothelial 
function results in improvements in cerebrovascular function 
by way of increased cerebral blood flow and brain volume, 
with a concurrent delay in naturally declining cerebral tissue 
density.33,35–37 Taken together, these findings provide further 
evidence in support the current guideline recommendations 
advocating regular physical activity for improvement in CRF 
and prevention of cardiovascular disease.38–40
Several limitations should be noted. First, the study popu-
lation derived from the CCLS represents a cohort that is well 
educated with access to preventive healthcare and a low bur-
den of traditional risk factors. Although our findings may 
not generalize to the CCLS participants that were excluded 
from the study because of lack of Medicare coverage or the 
general population, our data provide a unique opportunity to 
characterize the health benefits of CRF in later life. In this 
context, the low prevalence of established risk factors at base-
line represents a unique strength, allowing us to characterize 
the association between CRF and stroke risk independent of 
other comorbidities. Second, we combined individual-level 
data obtained from the CCLS with Medicare claims files to 
compare the association between CRF and stroke at the age 
of ≥65 years. Stroke hospitalizations that occurred between 
study entry and the onset of Medicare eligibility were not 
captured, and therefore we were not able to estimate the asso-
ciation between CRF and incident stroke. To accommodate 
this limitation, we compared the association between base-
line CRF and the rate of stroke hospitalization, using attained 
age as the time scale. Therefore, a stroke hospitalization that 
occurred before Medicare enrollment would not influence 
our results. Third, we rely on Medicare claims files to iden-
tify stroke hospitalizations, and therefore, some events might 
have been missed or misclassified. However, measurement 
error tends to bias toward the null and encouragingly, the 
association between CRF and stroke hospitalizations were 
present despite use of administrative data. Finally, owing to 
the observational nature of the study, there is a potential for 
residual confounding, observation bias, and reverse causa-
tion in the observed associations. However, all the traditional 
risk factors and the stroke outcomes reported in the study are 
objectively measured using previously reported standardized 
protocols, and all participants received the same work-up 
regardless of their baseline cardiorespiratory fitness level. 
Thus, the likelihood of the confounding because of observer 
or selection bias is small. Furthermore, the time gap of many 
decades between CRF assessment and stroke diagnosis, 
the overall healthy nature of the cohort at baseline, and the

consistent inverse association between fitness measured con-
tinuously and stroke risk with no apparent threshold effect 
makes it less likely that the observed findings are because of 
reverse causation.
In summary, we observed that CRF in healthy, middle-aged 
adults demonstrated a dose-dependent, inverse association 
with stroke hospitalization in later life. This association was 
independent of incident hypertension, DM, and AF. Additional 
studies are needed to determine whether improvement in CRF 
among sedentary adults may reduce the risk of stroke in older 
age above and beyond risk factor modification.
