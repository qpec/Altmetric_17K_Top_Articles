Abstract 
Background: Malignant mesothelioma is an aggressive, almost uniformly fatal tumor, caused primarily by exposure 
to asbestos. In this study, serum presence of mesothelioma-specific protein transcript variants of ecto-nicotinamide 
adenine dinucleotide oxidase disulfide-thiol exchanger 2 (ENOX2), a recently identified marker of malignancy, were 
investigated using the ONCOblot tissue of origin cancer detection test.
Methods: Sequential serum samples collected from asbestos-exposed individuals prior to the development of frank 
mesothelioma were assayed for ENOX2 presence by 2-D gel immunoblot analysis to determine how long in advance 
of clinical symptoms mesothelioma-specific ENOX2 transcript variants could be detected.
Results: Two mesothelioma-specific ENOX2 protein transcript variants were detected in the serum of asbestos-
exposed individuals 4–10 years prior to clinical diagnosis of malignant mesothelioma (average 6.2 years). Either one 
or both ENOX2 protein transcript variants indicative of malignant mesothelioma were absent in 14 of 15 subjects 
diagnosed with benign pleural plaques either with or without accompanying asbestosis.
Conclusions: In a population of asbestos-exposed subjects who eventually developed malignant mesothelioma, 
ENOX2 protein transcript variants characteristic of malignant mesothelioma were present in serum 4–10 years in 
advance of clinical symptoms. As with all biomarker studies, these observations require validation in a larger, inde-
pendent cohort of patients and should include prospective as well as retrospective sampling.

Background
Malignant mesothelioma is an aggressive, almost uni-
formly fatal, asbestos-induced cancer [1, 2]. It is a tumor 
of the serosal cavities, predominantly of the pleura and 
is generally widespread throughout the cavity at the time 
of presentation. Patients who are treated with supportive 
care have a median survival of only 9 months [3]. Those 
treated with the best available chemotherapy (pem-
etrexed and cisplatinum) have an average increased sur-
vival of only 10 weeks [4], with a median survival between 
9 and 14 months [5]. However, in select patients with 
early-stage epithelial disease who undergo extra pleu-
ral pneumonectomy, followed by adjunct chemotherapy 
and radiotherapy, 5-year survival rates of 46 % have been 
reported [6]. Therefore, like most cancers, early detection 
of malignant mesothelioma has the potential to improve 
patient outcomes [7].

tion test, a serum-based method for cancer detection,

has been described [8]. The test is based on the discovery 
that there are cancer-specific transcript variants of ecto-
nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide oxidase disulfide-
thiol exchanger 2 (ENOX2) [8, 9] and consists of 2-D gel 
electrophoretic separation of serum proteins followed by 
immunoblot analysis with an ENOX2-specific recom-
binant antibody. ENOX2 belongs to a family of cell sur-
face proteins that oxidize reduced pyridine nucleotides 
[NAD(P)H] and are essential for cell enlargement and 
growth [10]. At least 20 tissue of origin specific patterns 
of ENOX2 transcript variants have been described (and/
or combinations of isoforms) indicative of the cancer tis-
sue of origin [8]. These ENOX2 proteins are shed into the 
circulation and can be detected in some early stage can-
cers, including: breast, lung, colon, prostate and ovarian 
cancer (Table 1).
ENOX2 transcript variants of specific molecular 
weights and isoelectric points (pIs) are produced uniquely 
by patients with cancer [10]. Identification of cancer pres-
ence by detecting ENOX2 transcript variants produces a 
low incidence of both false positives and false negatives 
(>1 % for subjects with clinically confirmed cancers), as 
they are molecular signature molecules produced specifi-
cally by cancer cells and are absent from non-cancer cells 
[10]. The predictive correlation between ONCOblot find-
ings and the onset of cancer is based on findings that sup-
port ENOX2 as a marker of cancer presence [11].
Considerable interest exists in the development of early 
screening tests for malignant mesothelioma in asbes-
tos-exposed populations. Therefore, the present study 
was undertaken to determine if cancer-specific ENOX2 
transcript variants might serve as biomarkers to detect

the presence of malignant mesothelioma in advance 
of clinical symptoms. To this end, serum samples, col-
lected prior to diagnosis as part of a prospective cohort 
study [12, 13], were examined by using the ONCOblot 
test. This examination of serum samples from asbestos-
exposed subjects revealed that patients with a clinically 
confirmed diagnosis of malignant mesothelioma pro-
duced a consistent pattern of two ENOX2 transcript vari-
ants. These two transcript variants were detected well in 
advance of clinical symptoms. These findings indicate 
that the ONCOblot Tissue of Origin Cancer Detection 
Test might, if validated in other studies, provide a useful 
addition to the diagnostic repertoire of tests for the early 
detection of malignant mesothelioma [14, 15].
Results
Study population characteristics
Sera from 17 individuals with confirmed malignant mes-
othelioma were studied (Table 2). The majority of the 
malignant mesothelioma cases were of epithelial histol-
ogy and all occurred in the pleural cavity. The major-
ity of cases were male and the mean age of diagnosis 
was 67. The median survival for this group of patients 
was 24 months (95 % CI 20–30) after clinical diagno-
sis. For seven individuals, annual pre-diagnosis samples 
were available for analysis (Figs. 1a,b; 2). Sera from 15 
asbestos-exposed subjects but free of malignancy were 
analyzed in parallel (Table 3). These subjects had a variety 
of benign lung and pleural disease and were of a similar 
age to the malignant mesothelioma patients at the time 
of serum collection (mean age 72 years). The asbestos-
exposed control group included two females. For three 
individuals, annual serum samples were available for 
analysis (Table 3).

ENOX2 transcript variants indicative of malignant 
mesothelioma
The signature pattern of ENOX2 isoforms produced by 
malignant mesothelioma consisted of two ENOX2 tran-
script variants (Table 1; Fig. 1a, b). Consistently, two 
isoforms of ENOX2 were detected in sera samples col-
lected from subjects an average 7.5 months (SD = 8) 
after confirmed diagnosis of malignant mesothelioma 
(Table 2). The larger ENOX2 transcript variant (Protein 
1) had a molecular weight of 64 ± 2.7 kDa and a pI of pH 
3.9 ± 0.1. The smaller variant (Protein 2) had a molecular 
weight of 41 ± 1.9 kDa and a pI of pH 4.3 ± 0.2. Both 
were detected in all 17 patients. The range in size and pI 
was 60–68 kDa, pH 3.8–4.1 for Protein 1 and 38–44 kDa, 
pH 3.8–4.6 for Protein 2 (Table 1).
ENOX2 transcript variants detected in pre‑diagnosis serum 
samples
For seven mesothelioma patients, annual serum sam-
ples were available before clinical diagnosis. For all 
seven, both ENOX2 protein isoforms were detected in 
pre-diagnostic serum samples (Figs. 1a, b; 2) available at 
least 4 years before diagnosis. For one subject, ENOX2 
was detected 10 years prior to diagnosis (Fig. 2). While 
in five subjects both the Protein 1 and Protein 2 were 
detected at the same time point, expression of only Pro-
tein 1 was encountered in advance of Protein 2 in serial 
sample sets from Patients ID 94 and 2774 (Fig. 2). Also, 
for one subject (ID 129), Protein 2 was detected inter-
mittently between 96 and 72 months prior to diagnosis. 
Overall, both of the mesothelioma-specific ENOX2 tran-
script variants were detected 4–10 years in advance of 
clinical symptoms and with an average of 6.2 ± 2.6 years 
in advance of clinical symptoms (Fig. 2).
Subjects diagnosed with benign pleural plaques alone or 
with accompanying asbestosis
Of the fifteen asbestos-exposed subjects with benign 
pleural plaques either alone, or with accompanying 
asbestosis (Table 3), ENOX2 proteins were not detected 
in the sera of nine subjects (i.e., 60 %). Only one subject 
(ID 1268), was positive for both mesothelioma specific 
ENOX2 protein transcripts. Of the remainder, three 
subjects (ID 1542, 4334, and 4476) expressed only Pro-
tein 2 and two subjects (ID 4288 and 10011) expressed 
only Protein 1 (Table 3). Of the benign subjects exhib-
iting only Protein 1, both were female. For three sub-
jects, longitudinal annual serum samples were available. 
For patient ID 1268, both ENOX2 protein isoforms 
were detected over a 10 year period (Table 3). This 
individual remains clinically malignancy-free 1.5 years 
after the last sample was analyzed. He has extensive 
pleural plaques, has never smoked and has a normal 
serum mesothelin level (data not shown). Only one of 
the ENOX2 isoforms was expressed in the other two 
benign patients examined longitudinally, though the 
protein was present over several years. Patient ID 4288 
died approximately 1.5 years after the last sample was 
analyzed from non-malignant causes. Patient ID 1542 
remains alive approximately a year after the last sample 
was examined.
Correlation between clinical diagnosis and ENOX2 spot 
diameter
For subjects who developed mesothelioma, the spot 
diameter at the earliest date of detection for both Pro-
tein 1 and Protein 2 was 1.95 ± 0.3 mm (not shown). 
The diameter remained more or less constant, increas-
ing slightly to 2.3 ± 0.3 mm at the last date prior to 
mesothelioma diagnosis and a diameter of 3.2 ± 0.9 mm 
within the year following diagnosis. This represented 
approximately a twofold increase in serum ENOX2 
concentration between the initial date of early detec-
tion and the clinical diagnosis of frank mesothelioma 
(Fig. 3).
In contrast, the amount of ENOX2 detected in the sera 
of time series subjects who have not developed mesothe-
lioma (Table 3) either remained constant or declined. For 
subject ID 1268, spot diameter declined progressively 
from 2.0 to 0.8 mm between disease-free year 1 and 10. 
This decrease in spot diameter for Protein 1 for subject 
1268 represents a reduction in the circulating ENOX2 
concentration of approximately 90 % during the obser-
vation period, based on the relationship shown in Fig. 3. 
For subject ID 4288, expressing only Protein 1, the spot

diameter declined from 2.2 to 1.8 mm between disease-
free year 8 and 10. For patient ID 1542 expressing only 
Protein 2, spot diameters remained at 1.3 ± 0.3 mm over 
the 10 year observation period and for subject ID 1268 
exhibiting both Protein 1 and Protein 2, the spot diam-
eter remained constant at 1.3 ± 0.2 mm for a similar 
duration.
Discussion
The identification of specific ENOX2 isoforms in sera can 
be indicative of the presence of cancer and also indica-
tive of the cancer site. Malignant mesothelioma is char-
acterized by the presence of two ENOX2 protein species 
of molecular weight 64 and 41 kDa, and pI 3.9 and 4.3, 
respectively.
All 17 patients who were diagnosed with malignant 
mesothelioma displayed both mesothelioma-specific 
protein ENOX2 isoforms. Importantly, both ENOX2 
isoforms were required for a correct identification of 
malignant mesothelioma by using the ONCOblot test 
(Table 1).
Of the cancer types examined to date, the ONCOblot 
pattern for malignant mesothelioma most closely resem-
bles that of bladder cancer (Table 1). However, the pI of 
the larger molecular weight transcript variant is suffi-
ciently different to avoid mischaracterization (Table 1). 
In any case, differentiating these two cancers rarely pre-
sents a diagnostic dilemma clinically. For malignant 
mesothelioma two ENOX2 protein transcript variants 
are evident; indeed multiple ENOX2 isoforms are seen

in approximately half of the different types of cancer 
(Table 1).
The two ENOX2 transcripts were apparent in the seven 
mesothelioma patients examined, 4–11 years before the 
clinical onset of disease (Fig. 2). This is an exciting find-
ing and implies that production of ENOX2 proteins are 
an early event in carcinogenesis. To our knowledge, this 
is the earliest prediagnostic indicator of cancer thus 
far reported. The use of serum biomarkers for the early 
detection of cancer has been the goal of many individual 
researchers and research consortia, such as the Early 
Detection Research Network [16, 17]. While some serum 
biomarkers have been described, few are used in routine 
clinical practice [18], and most give a lead time of less 
than a year [19]. Biomarker utility is hampered by low 
levels of specificity combined with a propensity to yield 
false positives [20]. The only useful biomarker for meso-
thelioma is mesothelin which is elevated in between 15 
and 40 % of individuals exposed to asbestos before diag-
nosis of mesothelioma [7]. Asbestos-exposed individuals 
represent an ideal cohort to evaluate prospective serum 
biomarkers for cancer detection, due to both their quan-
tifiable exposure to a carcinogen and the well-established 
link to a specific cancer type, malignant mesothelioma.
The distribution of histological asbestos-related lung 
cancer is similar to that of lung cancers of other etiolo-
gies [21, 22]. The test has been evaluated previously for 
both non-small cell and small cell lung cancers (Table 1). 
Those cancers exhibit a single ENOX2 protein unique to 
lung cancer but can be distinguished by their pIs [8].
Of the subjects with benign disease, 60 % lacked 
ENOX2 proteins in their serum (Table 3). Both protein 
transcript variants were found in the serum of only one 
subject currently diagnosed with benign disease (subject 
ID 1268). For the remaining five subjects diagnosed with 
benign disease, only one protein transcript variant was 
detected. It is possible that the presence of one of the two 
mesothelioma-specific isoforms is an indicator of early 
pathological changes that predate the development of 
mesothelioma, as the transition from benign disease to 
malignant mesothelioma may be required for both tran-
script variants to be present. This issue would require 
longer follow-up to elucidate. Within the ONCOblot 
test, the presence of only the high molecular weight 
mesothelioma-specific ENOX2 transcript variant would 
be identified as ‘not in the database’ as no malignancy 
characterized to date produces a single ENOX2 tran-
script variant with a similar molecular weight and pI as 
this ENOX2 transcript variant. In contrast, the presence 
of only the low molecular weight transcript variant would 
be misidentified as a cancer of blood cell origin (Table 1).
Of note, for the three patients who were diagnosed 
with benign disease and examined in a time series, the 
detected ENOX2 spot size either remained constant or 
declined during the observational period. Two of these 
subjects (subject ID 1542 and 4288) produced only 
one ENOX2 transcript variant (Table 3). Although the 
remaining patient (subject ID 1268) produced both mes-
othelioma-specific transcript variants (Table 3), a steady 
decline of Protein 1–40 % of the initial amount detected 
was observed over a 9 year period. The largest spot diam-
eter encountered in patients clinically diagnosed with 
mesothelioma was 6.6 mm representing a nearly ten-
fold increase in ENOX2 proteins in the serum compared 
to levels giving rise to a 2 mm diameter spot at early 
detection. It is possible, though not proven, that as the 
controls in this study have all been exposed to asbestos 
that these false positives may represent a pre-malignant 
stage of mesothelioma that has yet to become clinically 
meaningful. Furthermore, mesothelioma is recognized 
for the long latency period between asbestos exposure 
and malignancy, so it is possible that during this phase 
equilibrium is maintained between the host and the can-
cer. The presence of one of the mesothelioma-associated 
ENOX2 transcript variants may reflect this interac-
tion. The immune system is capable of influencing the 
outcome of mesothelioma patients, as evidenced by the 
occasional finding of spontaneous mesothelioma regres-
sion accompanied by strong lymphocyte infiltration [23] 
and by spontaneous humoral responses [24]. This notion 
will be investigated further.
A test that can detect mesothelioma at an early stage 
might offer the prospect of early intervention as an 
approach to improve patient outcomes. The data from 
this study demonstrate that serum ENOX2 proteins char-
acteristic of malignant mesothelioma can be detected in 
subjects 4–11 years before diagnosis based on clinical 
Fig. 3 Log-log linear relationship between spot diameter and 
amount of ENOX2 protein. Varying amounts of purified, recombinant 
ENOX2 were analyzed by immunoblot. The log of the diameter of the 
detected ENOX2 spot was then plotted as a function of the log of the 
amount of ENOX2 loaded

symptoms, and raises the possibility that the benefits of 
early intervention could be studied in such individuals.
Conclusions
In a population of asbestos-exposed subjects who even-
tually developed malignant mesothelioma, ENOX2 tran-
script variants characteristic of malignant mesothelioma 
were present in serum 4–10 years in advance of clinical 
symptoms. As with all biomarker studies, these observa-
tions require validation in a larger, independent cohort of 
patients and should include prospective as well as retro-
spective sampling.
Methods
Case control identification
Serum samples were randomly selected from individu-
als who participated in an ongoing cancer prevention 
program [12, 13]. Samples were chosen from individu-
als with (1) a diagnosis of malignant mesothelioma con-
firmed by the Western Australian Mesothelioma Registry 
[25] and (2) from asbestos-exposed control subjects with 
benign pleural plaques either alone or with accompany-
ing asbestosis [26]. For a sub-set of subjects, annually col-
lected longitudinal serum samples were available. This 
study was approved by the Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital

Serum samples were analyzed for the presence of 
ENOX2 protein transcript variants by using the 
ONCOblot Tissue of Origin Cancer Detection Test as 
described [8–10]. Briefly, 25 µl of serum were sepa-
rated using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis with 
isoelectric focusing in the first dimension to determine 
pI and SDS–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the 
second dimension to determine molecular weight. Pro-
teins were transferred to nitrocellulose and ENOX2 
proteins were identified by immunoblot analysis with 
an ENOX2-specific recombinant antibody linked to 
alkaline phosphatase using a colorimetric substrate for 
detection. Blots were scanned and the pI and molecular 
weight of each ENOX2 transcript variant present was 
calculated by comparison to molecular weight stand-
ards and to two internal reference proteins (serotrans-
ferrin, ca. 82 kDa, pI 6.8, and α-fetuin, ca. 53 kDa, pI 
4.1). The two reference serum proteins, serotransferrin 
and α-fetuin are detected on western blots because they 
both share a similar five amino acid sequence within 
the antibody combining site shared by all ENOX2 pro-
tein transcript variants [10]. Transferrin or α-fetuin 
antibodies were not added nor is the reaction unspe-
cific. Each transcript variant of ENOX2 migrates to a 
specific location defined by the two reference proteins 
and has a specific location (molecular weight and pI) 
on the blot that correlates to the known tissue of origin 
determined from banked sera samples collected from 
individuals with a clinically confirmed diagnosis of can-
cer (Table 1).
The protein chemistry differences that underlie the 
molecular weight and pI differences that distinguish 
tissue-specific ENOX2 transcript variants result from 
alternative splicing of the ENOX2 mRNA [27]. Each of 
the protein transcript variants share a common exon 5 
which contains the ENOX2-specific antibody-combin-
ing site including the amino acid sequence EEMTE. The 
overall sensitivity of the test is estimated to be >95 %.
The different tissues of origin provide for non-over-
lapping patterns of ENOX2 protein transcript variants 
each with a characteristic number of protein transcript 
variants, molecular weights and pIs. The majority of the 
tissues of origin, including small cell and non-small cell 
lung cancer, are represented by a single transcript vari-
ant. Several tissues of origin, including mesothelioma, 
ovarian, hepatocellular, uterine and six others are repre-
sented by two transcript variants. Three cancer tissues of 
origin, stomach, colon and kidney, have three [8].
Quantitation of ENOX2 based on spot diameter
To estimate relative amounts of ENOX2 in sera, data 
from patients were compared to a standard curve of 
known amounts of a functional, 46 kDa form of recom-
binant human ENOX2 generated in E coli. The log of the 
spot diameter and the log of the mass of ENOX2 detected 
by immunoblot after 2-D separation correlated linearly, 
r2 = 0.95 (Fig. 3). The complete amino acid sequence of a 
72 kDa form of ENOX2 is available from GenBank under 
accession no. AF207881. The limit of detection of the 
ONCOblot assay is approximately 100 femtomoles of an 
ENOX2 protein [11].
