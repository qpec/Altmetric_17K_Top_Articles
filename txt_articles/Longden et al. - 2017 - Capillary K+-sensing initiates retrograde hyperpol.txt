Abstract
Blood flow into the brain is dynamically regulated to satisfy the changing metabolic requirements 
of neurons, but how this is accomplished has remained unclear. Here, we demonstrate a central 
role for capillary endothelial cells in sensing neural activity and communicating it to upstream 
arterioles in the form of an electrical vasodilatory signal. We further demonstrate that this signal is 
initiated by extracellular potassium (K+)—a byproduct of neural activity—which activates 
capillary endothelial cell inward-rectifier K+ (KIR2.1) channels to produce a rapidly propagating 
retrograde hyperpolarization that causes upstream arteriolar dilation, increasing blood flow into 
the capillary bed. Our results establish brain capillaries as an active sensory web that converts 
changes in external K+ into rapid, ‘inside-out’ electrical signaling to direct blood flow to active 
brain regions.

 coupling (NVC), which translates neural activity into a rapid increase in local blood flow 
(“functional hyperemia”) by causing dilation of penetrating (parenchymal) arterioles and 
surface (pial) arteries1. To serve its on-demand function, this mechanism must be capable of 
fast, long-distance transmission of vasodilator signals from deep within the cortex to the 
brain’s surface2. However, how neural activity is sensed by and transmitted from the 
microcirculation is not known.
It is generally accepted that NVC involves the release of vasodilator substances from 
neurons and/or astrocytes, and it has been proposed that the smooth muscle (SM) of 
parenchymal arterioles is a target of such vasoactive compounds3. Parenchymal arterioles 
supply blood to discrete regions of the cortex4, but their limited spatial coverage of the brain 
precludes their direct communication with the vast majority of neurons. By contrast, every 
neuron is closely apposed to endothelial cells (ECs) of the extensive, anastomosing network 
of brain capillaries5. This uniquely positions capillary ECs (cECs) to act as sensors of local 
neuronal activity throughout the brain. Nonetheless, cECs have not been viewed as active 
participants in NVC.
By postulating electrical coupling between brain cECs as reported for systemic arteriolar 
ECs6, it is possible to envision a mechanism in which the continuous, interconnected 
capillary network acts like a system of “wires” to communicate electrical signals to 
upstream parenchymal arterioles, and ultimately to pial arteries. In contrast to axonal 
electrical communication, which takes the form of a propagating membrane potential 
depolarization, this would involve transmission of a hyperpolarizing signal from cECs to 
ECs in upstream arterioles and surface arteries. The subsequent spread of this 
hyperpolarization to adjacent SM through gap junctions at myoendothelial projections7 
would then hyperpolarize the SM, deactivating voltage-dependent calcium (Ca2+) channels, 
diminishing Ca2+ influx and reducing Ca2+-dependent actin-myosin cross-bridge cycling, 
resulting in arterial/arteriolar dilation8.
An important molecular requirement for such signaling is an ion channel whose activation 
enables regeneration of current over long distances. K+ channels of the KIR2 family are 
perfectly suited to act as EC sensors of neural activity: they are activated by external K+, 
which accumulates during neural activity9, and the resultant increase in their K+ 
conductance can be regenerated in neighboring cells by virtue of the steep activation of these 
channels by hyperpolarization10–12. Because endothelial cells have a depolarized resting 
membrane potential (approximately −40 mV)13, and the K+ equilibrium potential (EK) is 
very negative (approximately −103 mV in cerebrospinal fluid), increases in capillary KIR 
channel conductance in response to an elevation of K+ to less than ~25 mM would cause 
membrane potential hyperpolarization towards the new EK. This hyperpolarizing current 
would then be transmitted through gap junctions to the adjacent cEC, activating resident KIR 
channels and thereby regenerating the hyperpolarizing current. Despite the intrinsic appeal 
of this concept, little is known regarding the ion channel repertoire of cECs or their role in 
regulating cerebral blood flow (CBF).

 Here, we demonstrate that brain capillaries act as a sensory web to coordinately and 
dynamically translate neural activity within the brain parenchyma into an increase in local 
blood flow, establishing brain capillaries as a central element in the NVC process.
RESULTS
Brain cECs express KIR2 channels: functional K+ sensors
Using a mechanical and enzymatic dissociation approach, we acutely isolated mouse brain 
cECs for electrophysiological analyses of their ion channel profile (Fig. 1a). To facilitate 
detection of KIR channels, we raised external [K+]o to 60 mM and measured whole-cell 
currents in response to 200-ms voltage ramps from −140 to +50 mV. Pronounced inward 
currents were detected at potentials negative to the K+ equilibrium potential (EK; −23 mV), 
whereas at potentials positive to EK the current rectified dramatically (Fig. 1b). Barium 
(Ba2+), a selective pore-blocker of KIR2 channels at concentrations less than 100 μM10, 
eliminated this current (Fig. 1b). Accordingly, Ba2+-sensitive traces revealed a current 
signature characteristic of the strong inward-rectifier KIR2 channel family10,14 (Fig. 1c).
Functional KIR2 channels are homo- or heterotetrameric assemblies of KIR2.1–2.3 
subunits15. In the cerebral circulation, the KIR2.1 subunit (encoded by the Kcnj2 gene) is an 
essential component of native SM KIR channels16. To test whether this is also true for cECs, 
we used a Cre-lox strategy to generate an EC-specific KIR2.1-knockout (EC KIR2.1−/−) 
mouse17,18 and examined its cEC KIR current properties. In contrast to cells from wild-type 
(WT) mice, all of which displayed KIR currents, none of the examined cECs from EC 
KIR2.1−/− mice possessed Ba2+-sensitive currents (Fig. 1, d–f). A quantitative reverse 
transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) analysis confirmed that Kcnj2 gene 
transcripts were dramatically reduced in brain cECs from these mice (Supplementary Fig. 
1). We also found that KIR currents in pial artery SM cells (Supplementary Fig. 2) were 
unchanged compared with those in WT mice, confirming EC-specific KIR knockout. 
Additional control experiments showed that cEC KIR currents were not disrupted by the 
presence of loxP sites flanking the Kcnj2 gene (KIR2.1fl/fl mice) or by Cre recombinase 
expression in the endothelium (Tek-Cre mice; Supplementary Table 1). These data indicate 
that KIR2.1 is a critical component of functional KIR channels in brain cECs and establish 
the validity of our EC KIR2.1−/− mouse model.
Ca2+-activated SK and IK channels are not expressed in brain cECs
Without exception, ECs in all arteries and arterioles studied to date possess small- and 
intermediate-conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channels (SK and IK, respectively)19, which 
transduce changes in intracellular Ca2+ into membrane hyperpolarization. Contrary to 
expectations, we found no evidence for either of these channels in cECs. With 300 nM 
intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) in the patch pipette, a saturating concentration (1 μM) of the 
synthetic, selective SK/IK channel agonist NS309 (EC50 ≈ 10 nM)20 did not affect cEC 
currents (Fig. 1g), but did evoke robust SK/IK channel activation in pial artery ECs (Fig. 1i 
and Supplementary Fig. 3a). Next, we attempted to stimulate Ca2+-sensitive currents in 
cECs directly by setting the pipette (intracellular) [Ca2+] to 3 μM. This maneuver produced 
large K+ currents (nearly identical to those evoked by NS309) in pial ECs (Fig. 1i and 
Longden et al.

 Supplementary Fig. 3b), but did not change membrane currents in cECs (Fig. 1h,i). Dialysis 
of cECs with a solution designed to buffer [Ca2+]i to very low levels also had no effect on 
currents (Fig. 1i). These data indicate that cECs lack functional SK and IK channels and, 
more broadly, entirely lack Ca2+-activated ion channels in the plasma membrane.
Capillaries translate local elevations of K+ into upstream arteriolar dilations
Expression of functional KIR2.1 channels endows cECs with the ability to detect and 
respond to increases in external K+ with membrane hyperpolarization10. To test whether K+ 
activation of KIR channels in cECs can dilate upstream arterioles, we developed a novel ex 
vivo preparation. An extension of our well-established approach using isolated parenchymal 
arterioles from mice21–23, this CaPA (capillary-parenchymal arteriole) preparation consists 
of a cannulated parenchymal arteriole segment with an intact, downstream capillary tree held 
in place with an overlying micropipette that occludes and stabilizes its extremities (Fig. 
2a,b). Responses of the arteriolar segment to pressure and bath application of vasodilators 
(NS309, 10 mM K+) or constrictor agonists (U46619) were the same in both isolated 
parenchymal arterioles and CaPA preparations (Supplementary Fig. 4). An important 
advantage of the CaPA preparation is that it allows vasoactive agents to be directly and 
selectively applied onto terminal ends of the capillaries or onto the arteriole without 
producing confounding effects on other cell types in the brain.
Using this approach, we selectively stimulated capillaries (or arterioles) with agents and 
measured arteriolar diameter at two zones ~200 μm apart (Fig. 2c). Application of 10 mM 
K+ to capillary extremities produced a rapid and reproducible dilation of the upstream 
arteriole in both zones (Fig. 2d–f and Supplementary Movie 1). Consistent with our 
hypothesis, arteriolar dilation to capillary-applied 10 mM K+ was prevented by pretreatment 
with 30 μM Ba2+ (Fig. 2d,f) and was eliminated in EC KIR2.1−/− mice (Fig. 2e,f). We also 
tested whether upstream arterioles dilated to lower concentrations (6–9 mM) of capillary-
applied K+. These experiments revealed a threshold for activation between 6 and 7 mM K+, 
followed by graded responses to concentrations between 7 and 10 mM (Supplementary Fig. 
5).
In control experiments, pressure ejection of the IK/SK agonist, NS309 (1 μM), onto 
capillary extremities ~280 μm distant from Zone 1 had no effect on upstream arteriole 
diameter (Supplementary Fig. 6), consistent with the lack of functional SK and IK channels 
in cECs (Fig. 1g–i). As expected, delivery of NS309 through a pipette positioned directly 
adjacent to the arteriole produced robust dilation through activation of arteriolar EC SK and 
IK channels (Supplementary Fig. 6)24. These observations illustrate that compounds 
delivered onto capillaries in this preparation do not inadvertently stimulate the upstream 
arteriole. Parenchymal arterioles from EC KIR2.1−/− mice exhibited normal myogenic tone 
and vasodilatory responses to direct delivery of 1 μM NS309 (Supplementary Fig. 7), 
indicating that vasomotor function and endothelial communication to the arteriolar SM 
remained intact despite the loss of functional EC KIR channels. Upstream arteriole dilation 
to capillary-applied K+ was also retained in KIR2.1fl/fl mice and Tek-Cre mice 
(Supplementary Table 1), confirming that the absence of K+-induced upstream arteriolar

 dilation is not an artifactual consequence of the presence of floxed-KIR2.1 or Tek-Cre 
cassettes.
Elevation of K+ around capillaries evokes retrograde electrical signaling to the SM of 
upstream arterioles
Activation of K+ channels in parenchymal arteriole ECs generates hyperpolarization that is 
transferred to the SM via myoendothelial gap junctions24. To test the hypothesis that K+-
mediated dilation in our CaPA preparation reflects the propagation of a hyperpolarizing 
signal from capillaries, we measured the SM cell membrane potential at Zone 2, ~500 μm 
from the site of capillary stimulation (Fig. 2c). Application of 10 mM K+ onto capillaries 
caused a reversible −23.2 ± 1.8 mV hyperpolarization with an onset latency of 0.24 ± 0.03 s 
(Fig. 2c,g,h). Previous analyses of membrane potential-diameter relationships in pial arteries 
and parenchymal arterioles25,26 indicate that membrane potential hyperpolarization to about 
−56 mV should cause near maximal dilation—exactly as we observed (Fig. 2,e–h). 
Collectively, the brief latency to hyperpolarization, which is compatible with electrical 
transmission, and control experiments showing that capillary-applied agents do not 
inadvertently come in direct contact with the upstream arteriolar segment (Supplementary 
Fig. 6), compel the conclusion that brain cECs are electrically coupled, as supported by 
previous studies on peripheral cECs6. This conclusion is further buttressed by the 
observation that responses to capillary-applied agents are lost if the physical integrity of the 
CaPA preparation is disrupted by severing the capillary segment at the arteriole junction 
(Supplementary Fig. 8). Therefore, our data support the concept that brain capillary KIR 
channels act as K+ sensors to initiate a retrograde hyperpolarization that is rapidly 
transmitted through the endothelium to upstream parenchymal arteriolar SM to cause 
vasodilation.
In contrast to 10 mM K+, neither 25 nor 60 mM K+ caused a sustained upstream dilation 
(Fig. 2i,j), indicating that K+ concentrations > 25 mM do not cause membrane potential 
hyperpolarization10,26. Since direct application of K+ > 25 mM causes sustained membrane 
potential depolarization and constriction of cerebral arteries21,26,27, the absence of a 
constrictor response to 25 or 60 mM K+ further confirms that substances pressure ejected 
onto capillaries do not inadvertently stimulate the upstream arteriole and indicates that 
capillaries lack the ion channels required to generate regenerative depolarizing currents. 
Collectively, these results imply that retrograde vasodilatory signaling will be short-circuited 
in cases of substantially elevated external K+, as occurs in certain pathological settings, such 
as cortical spreading depression and ischemia28.
Raising K+ around capillaries in vivo evokes upstream arteriolar dilation and capillary 
hyperemia
To extend these observations in vivo, we tested whether capillary KIR channel-mediated 
retrograde electrical communication dilates upstream arterioles to deliver more blood into 
the capillary bed. We stimulated brain capillary segments in situ with K+ and recorded either 
upstream arteriolar diameter or capillary red blood cell (RBC) flux and velocity through a 
cranial window using two-photon laser-scanning microscopy (Fig. 3a). To visualize the 
arteriolar-capillary network in vivo (Fig. 3b) and enable contrast imaging of RBCs, we

 introduced fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled dextran into the circulation of 
anesthetized mice. We then positioned a pipette containing 10 mM K+ adjacent to a post-
arteriolar capillary (130 ± 15 μm downstream of the feed arteriole; n = 22; Fig. 3c) and 
raised local K+ by pressure ejection of 10 mM K+ for 200–300 ms (Fig. 3d and 
Supplementary Movie 2). This maneuver caused a rapid (latency, 3.8 ± 0.9 s; n = 11) and 
robust increase in RBC flux (73% ± 23%; n = 11; Fig. 3e,g,j) and velocity (Supplementary 
Fig. 9a,e). These effects were not observed following ejection of a 3 mM K+ solution 
(Supplementary Fig. 10), precluding a mechanical mechanism. Inhibiting neuronal activity 
by cranial-surface application of tetrodotoxin (3 μM), a voltage-dependent Na+ channel 
blocker, did not attenuate K+-induced increases in RBC flux or velocity (Supplementary Fig. 
11), also ruling out a coupling mechanism involving direct neuronal stimulation. The 
specific involvement of EC KIR channels in these in vivo actions of applied K+ was 
examined by measuring hyperemic responses to K+ in the presence of Ba2+ and in EC 
KIR2.1−/− mice. Application of 10 mM K+ onto capillaries of EC KIR2.1−/− mice failed to 
increase RBC flux or velocity (Fig. 3f,h,j and Supplementary Fig. 9b,f), supporting the 
central role of EC KIR2.1 channels in K+-induced retrograde signaling and capillary 
hyperemia. Furthermore, 10 mM K+ did not change capillary RBC velocity or flux in WT 
mice in the presence of 100 μM Ba2+ (Fig. 3i,j and Supplementary Fig. 9c,d,g). Together, 
these data indicate that increases in external K+ drive KIR channel-mediated retrograde 
capillary-to-arteriole communication in vivo through activation of EC KIR2.1 channels (Fig. 
3j).
To confirm that hyperemic responses to capillary application of 10 mM K+ result from 
upstream arteriole dilation, we assessed the diameters of feed arterioles in response to 
capillary stimulation with K+. Consistent with our blood flow results, delivery of K+ onto a 
capillary invariably increased upstream feed arteriole diameter (32.9% ± 4.4%; n = 8; Fig. 
4a–d; Supplementary Movie 3), but had no effect on the diameter of the stimulated capillary 
(Fig. 4e).
Endothelial KIR2.1 channels are the primary actuators of K+ evoked increases in CBF and 
are critical for functional hyperemia
To examine the role of EC KIR2.1 channels in K+-evoked cerebral hyperemia in vivo, we 
recorded CBF in a volume of the somatosensory cortex through a cranial window using laser 
Doppler flowmetry. Application of 15 mM K+ to the cranial surface caused a robust increase 
in cortical CBF that was strongly inhibited (by 80%) by 100 μM Ba2+ in WT mice and 
greatly diminished (by 49%) in EC KIR2.1−/− mice, supporting the conclusion that EC 
KIR2.1 channels have a major role in K+-induced hyperemia (Fig. 5a). To confirm that this 
KIR2.1 channel-dependent mechanism is engaged during functional hyperemia—as implied 
by previous reports that Ba2+ substantially reduces neural activity-evoked increases in 
CBF27,29–31—we measured CBF responses evoked by whisker stimulation. Whisker 
stimulation-evoked CBF increases were markedly blunted (by 49%) in EC KIR2.1−/− mice 
(Fig. 5b,c) and following application of 100 μM Ba2+ (by 80%) in WT mice (Fig. 5c), 
consistent with cEC KIR2.1 channels playing an essential role in functional hyperemia. The 
residual Ba2+-sensitive component of K+- (Fig. 5a) and whisker stimulation-induced (Fig. 
5c) functional hyperemia in EC KIR2.1−/− mice is likely attributable to the direct

 engagement of SM KIR2.1 channels by topically applied K+ and K+ released from astrocytic 
endfeet during NVC, respectively, as previously demonstrated12,27. However, Ba2+ could 
also have direct effects on neural activity. To explore this possibility, we assessed local field 
potentials (LFPs) in the barrel cortex, evoked by whisker stimulation before and after 100 
μM Ba2+ superfusion. Whisker stimulation elicited clear LFP oscillations of 5.0 ± 0.1 Hz 
both with and without Ba2+ (Supplementary Fig. 12), consistent with the conclusion that, 
under these conditions, neural activity in response to whisker stimulation is maintained in 
the presence of Ba2+. Notably, a 5-fold higher concentration of Ba2+ than that used here also 
has no effect on sensory-evoked neural activity32, reinforcing our conclusion that the 
vasculature is the major target of Ba2+ in our in vivo experiments. As expected, hyperemic 
responses were preserved in KIR2.1fl/fl and Tek-Cre controls (Supplementary Table 1).
DISCUSSION
A single microliter of the cortex contains almost one meter of total vascular length33, with 
capillaries vastly outdistancing arterioles and venules in their reach. The number of cECs in 
the brain closely matches that of neurons34, and each brain capillary is < 15 μm from the 
nearest neuronal cell body35. This anatomical arrangement invites the hypothesis that long-
range conducted signaling from capillaries to upstream arterioles would be an efficient way 
to direct blood flow to the deep microcirculation in response to neuronal activity. Our 
findings provide strong experimental evidence in support of this concept, indicating that 
brain capillary networks function as a sensory web to relay information about neuronal 
activity to upstream arterioles and pial arteries. Specifically, our data support a mechanism 
in which activation of cEC KIR2.1 channels by K+ released during neural activity initiates a 
rapidly propagating hyperpolarization, conceptualized as an “inverse action potential”, that 
drives upstream arteriolar dilation, promoting rapid hyperemia at the site of the K+ increase 
(Supplementary Fig. 13). Because K+ ions are released during each neuronal action 
potential, this mechanism provides a means for tightly coupling CBF to the rhythms of 
neuronal firing within the brain, and places capillaries at center stage in the moment-to-
moment control of CBF.
Brain cECs are phenotypically distinct from their arteriolar counterparts
To date, there has been a paucity of information regarding which ion channels are expressed 
in brain cECs and how they affect capillary function. Our characterization of the ion channel 
repertoire of ECs in brain capillaries addresses this deficit, and provides important insights 
into both similarities and differences between these ECs and those in other vascular beds.
Critical for our functional model, we detected Kcnj2 transcripts in freshly isolated mouse 
brain capillary ECs and recorded strongly rectifying KIR currents from these cells that were 
sensitive to 100 μM Ba2+, a concentration relatively selective for KIR2 channels. 
Importantly, these currents were absent in EC KIR2.1−/− mice. These observations firmly 
establish that brain cECs possess functional KIR2 channels and demonstrate that the KIR2.1 
subunit is an essential component of this channel complex.
To our surprise, we found no evidence for Ca2+-activated SK or IK channels in cECs. This 
observation stands in stark contrast with all previously tested arteriolar ECs, which possess

 prominent SK and IK currents19. This finding is significant, in part, because it illustrates that 
cECs are not merely a continuation of the arteriolar endothelium, but instead are 
phenotypically distinct from their arteriolar counterparts. Functionally, the absence of these 
channels could support optimal electrical signaling along the capillary by removing an 
avenue for current leak.
Extracellular K+ drives capillary-to-arteriole electrical communication, causing upstream 
dilation
Action potentials, the defining feature of neuronal activity, are composed of an upstroke 
mediated by influx of Na+ via voltage-dependent Na+ channels and a repolarization phase 
attributable to K+ efflux mediated by a variety of K+ channels. Our model implicitly 
assumes that the activity of these latter channels underlies the increase in extracellular K+ 
that triggers EC KIR2.1-dependent electrical signaling, but other sources of K+ could also 
contribute. Prominent among these are astrocytes, which mediate arteriolar dilation in 
response to neuronal activation by releasing K+ onto parenchymal arterioles through large-
conductance Ca2+-activated K+ (BK) channels in astrocytic endfeet, thereby activating SM 
KIR channels12,27. Astrocytes also enwrap capillaries and almost completely encase the 
intracerebral vasculature36, unlike neuronal processes, which terminate on the vasculature 
more rarely37. Thus, this mechanism offers another likely avenue for K+ release onto 
capillaries, although this awaits experimental confirmation.
Our novel CaPA preparation provided the means to experimentally test the ability of 
capillaries to rapidly transmit a propagating vasodilatory signal in response to local increases 
in extracellular K+. Using this approach, we demonstrated that restricted application of a 
dilating concentration of K+ (10 mM) onto a capillary extremity caused rapid dilation of an 
attached, upstream arteriolar segment with myogenic tone. Direct evidence that this 
represents EC-to-SM electrical conduction is provided by experiments showing that 
stimulation of capillary extremities with 10 mM K+ resulted in arteriolar SM 
hyperpolarization. This hyperpolarization was detectable within 240 ms of the onset of 
stimulation ~500 μm distant from the stimulus site. This translates to a hyperpolarization 
conduction velocity of ~2 mm/s, a rate that is consistent with electrical transmission.
Conducted hyperpolarization implies electrical coupling between brain cECs, as has been 
demonstrated in peripheral vascular beds6,38. Electrical conduction in arterioles is enabled 
by the presence of gap junctions, formed from homo- or heteromeric assemblies of connexin 
(Cx) proteins, between ECs, between SM cells, and between ECs and SM at myoendothelial 
projections39. Notably, mRNAs for Cx37, Cx43 and Cx45 have been detected in acutely 
isolated brain ECs40, providing a potential molecular basis for the observed cell-cell 
electrical coupling in brain capillaries. The fact that capillary-applied K+ failed to evoke 
upstream dilation when the capillary-arteriole connection was severed also supports the 
conclusion that an intact capillary-arteriole continuum is essential for transmission, and rules 
out a mechanism involving the release and diffusion of other vasoactive mediators. Our 
experimental findings thus imply that cECs form an electrically connected syncytium—
analogous to a series of wires throughout the brain—that is coupled to the overlying SM at 
the arteriolar level.

 K+/KIR2.1-mediated capillary-to-arteriole communication underlies functional hyperemia in 
vivo
The hyperemic effect of small elevations of extracellular K+ in the cerebral circulation has 
been appreciated for more than 40 years41, but the precise cellular and molecular target of 
K+ in the cerebral circulation has so far eluded firm identification. Our demonstration that 
the increase in CBF induced by surface application of 15 mM K+ in a cranial window model 
was strongly inhibited by 100 μM Ba2+ and dramatically reduced in EC KIR2.1−/− mice 
firmly establishes a KIR2.1-containing channel as the molecular mediator of K+-induced 
hyperemia.
Our K+/KIR-dependent, capillary-mediated mechanism predicts that, in vivo, increases in 
vessel diameter will occur first in the most distal segment of the pial artery/parenchymal 
arteriole tree (i.e., most capillary-proximate) and spread progressively upstream to pial 
arteries. Indeed, in vivo imaging studies have revealed that dilation in response to neural 
activity proceeds in this manner2. These neurally driven dilations conduct at an apparent rate 
of 1–2 mm/s—a speed that is consistent with our measurements and argues for an 
underlying electrical mechanism.
It is this dilation of upstream arteries/arterioles that ultimately promotes a hyperemic 
response in the capillary bed where the triggering K+ signal originates. Experiments in 
which we extended our K+/KIR-mediated, capillary-based communication mechanism in 
vivo are consistent with this, showing that local pressure ejection of 10 mM K+ onto a 
capillary segment within the cortical parenchyma via a pipet caused dilation of the 
connected upstream arteriole and a subsequent increase in RBC flux and velocity in the 
stimulated capillary. Importantly, these responses were abrogated in the presence of 100 μM 
Ba2+ and were absent in EC KIR2.1−/− mice, confirming that cEC KIR2.1 channels are 
necessary for the hyperemic effect of local elevations in K+. A potential confounding issue 
in vivo is indirect effects of K+ on other cell types. For example, raising K+ could depolarize 
neurons and cause the release of other vasoactive factors. To control for this possibility, we 
performed experiments in the presence of tetrodotoxin, to block neuronal action potentials. 
As expected, whisker stimulation-evoked increases in capillary flux were completely 
eliminated by this maneuver, but hyperemic responses to subsequent pressure ejection of K+ 
onto capillaries persisted. These data further strengthen our conclusion that the observed in 
vivo responses are attributable to signaling inherent to the capillary wall, and are not the 
byproduct of inadvertent neuronal activation.
In a final test of the physiological significance of endothelial KIR2.1 channels in functional 
hyperemia, we measured changes in CBF induced by whisker stimulation in WT and EC 
KIR2.1−/− mice. Laser Doppler flowmetry revealed that the robust increases in CBF 
observed in WT mice were decreased by 50% in EC KIR2.1−/− mice. Importantly, Ba2+ 
eliminated all but ~20% of the hyperemic response in WT mice and reduced the evoked 
response in EC KIR2.1−/− mice to a similar level. Possible explanations for the residual 
Ba2+-sensitive component in our EC KIR2.1−/− mouse include direct activation of SM

 that KIR channels on SM are necessary for full manifestation of the hyperemic response to 
any NVC mediator, since hyperpolarization is a necessary step in vasodilation.
The capillary sensory web in context
Whether blood flow control in response to tissue metabolic requirements originates in 
capillaries is a long-standing question. Indeed, we proposed over 20 years ago that 
capillaries couple metabolic demand to increases in blood flow in cardiac muscle42. More 
recently, Atwell and colleagues suggested that functional hyperemia is initiated at the 
capillary level by pericyte relaxation mediated by neuronally derived PGE2, and reported 
that capillaries themselves dilate before upstream arterioles following stimulation43. It is 
important to note that, although we have not detected capillary dilation in response to 
stimulation, the continuous segments in which we measured capillary diameters lacked 
pericytes (based on images obtained using co-delivered TRITC). Thus, it is possible that 
overlying pericytes, if present at locations where stimuli were delivered, could regulate local 
capillary diameter, a possibility consistent with certain features of the model proposed by 
Attwell and colleagues44. Evidence from retinal preparations indicates that pericytes are 
electrically coupled to cECs44 and express KIR channels45. Thus, it is also conceivable that 
pericytes could provide input into K+/KIR-dependent signaling by amplifying incoming 
electrical signals during their relay to the upstream arteriole.
Recently, Nedergaard and colleagues46 proposed that a key early component of the 
hyperemic response to neuronal activity is an increase in capillary erythrocyte velocity 
resulting from deformation of RBCs in response to neuronal metabolism-induced dips in 
local O2 tension, reporting that increases in RBC velocity are observed in capillaries before 
they can be detected in upstream arterioles. This RBC-deformation model lacks a 
mechanism for increasing upstream arteriolar diameter. This is a major strength of our K+/
KIR-dependent electrical conduction mechanism: it provides a means for explaining the 
rapid upstream dilation that is a consistently reported feature of functional hyperemia2,46,47.
Conclusion
Collectively, our findings recast capillaries as a sensory web dedicated to the rapid and fine 
control of microcirculatory hemodynamics in support of fluctuating neuronal metabolic 
demands. In a broader context, similar mechanisms for translating local environmental 
changes into capillary signals to upstream arterioles likely exist in other electrically active 
tissues, such as cardiac and skeletal muscle.

 Generation of EC KIR2.1−/− mice
Mice carrying a germline knockout of the KIR2.1 gene specifically in ECs were generated by 
crossing mice carrying a floxed allele of the KIR2.1 gene Kcnj2 (KIR2.1fl/fl; InGenious 
Targeting Laboratory, USA) with mice in which Cre recombinase expression is driven by the 
Tek promoter (Tek-Cre; Jackson Laboratories, USA)17. The presence of LoxP sites and Cre 
recombinase was confirmed by genotyping offspring prior to all experiments by RT-PCR of 
tail clip samples using the following primer pairs: LoxP excision site, 5′-GCG GTC TGG 
CAG TAA AAA CTA TC-3′ (forward) and 5′-GTG AAA CAG CAT TGC TGT CAC 
TT-3′ (reverse); Cre recombinase, 5′-GCG GTC TGG CAG TAA AAA CTA TC-3′ 
(forward) and 5′-GTG AAA CAG CAT TGC TGT CAC TT-3′ (reverse).
Chemicals
6,7-Dichloro-1H-indole-2,3-dione 3-oxime (NS309), tetrodotoxin citrate, and 9,11-
dideoxy-9α,11α-methanoepoxy PGF2α (U46619) were obtained from Tocris Bioscience 
(USA). Unless otherwise noted, all other chemicals were obtained from Sigma Aldrich 
(USA).
Electrophysiology
Single ECs and capillary fragments were obtained from mouse brains by mechanically 
disrupting two 160-μm–thick brain slices in ice-cold artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF; 124 
mM NaCl, 3 mM KCl, 2 mM CaCl2, 2 mM MgCl2, 1.25 mM NaH2PO4, 26 mM NaHCO3, 
and 4 mM glucose) using a Dounce homogenizer. Debris was removed by passing the 
homogenate through a 62-μm nylon mesh. Retained capillary fragments were washed into a 
solution consisting of 55 mM NaCl, 80 mM Na-glutamate, 5.6 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 4 
mM glucose and 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.3), containing 0.5 mg/mL neutral protease and 0.5 
mg/mL elastase (Worthington, USA) plus 100 μM CaCl2, and then incubated for 25 min at 
36°C. Following this, 0.5 mg/mL collagenase type I (Worthington, USA) was added for an 
additional 2 min. Single cells and small capillary fragments were dispersed by triturating 4–
6 times with a fire-polished glass Pasteur pipette. Pial ECs and SM cells were obtained by 
dissecting surface arteries arising from the circle of Willis and the MCA and cleaning them 
of pia mater. Vessels were then digested using the same conditions as described above for 57 
min, with collagenase being added for a final 3 min. Single SM cells, ECs and EC patches 
were then dispersed by triturating 8–10 times.
Cells were patch-clamped in the conventional whole-cell configuration, and currents were 
amplified using an Axopatch 200B amplifier. Currents were filtered at 1 kHz and digitized at 
10 kHz. Pipettes were fabricated from borosilicate glass (1.5 mm outer diameter, 1.17 mm 
inner diameter; Sutter Instruments, USA), fire-polished to give a tip resistance of 3–6 MΩ, 
and filled with a solution consisting of 10 mM NaOH, 11.4 mM KOH, 128.6 mM KCl, 1.1 
mM MgCl2, 3.2 mM CaCl2, 5 mM EGTA, and 10 mM HEPES (300 nM free Ca2+; pH 7.2). 
In a subset of experiments, pipettes were filled with 10 mM NaOH, 6.8 mM KOH, 133.2 
mM KCl, 5.5 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM CaCl2, 5 mM EDTA, and 10 mM HEPES (3 μM free 
Ca2+; pH 7.2). For 0 [Ca2+]i experiments, the pipette solution consisted of 10 mM NaCl, 
11.4 mM KOH, 128.6 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 5 mM EGTA, and 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.2). 
The bath solution consisted of 80 or 134 mM NaCl, 60 or 6 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 10 mM

 HEPES, 4 mM glucose, and 2 mM CaCl2 (pH 7.4). The mean capacitance of capillary ECs 
was 9.4 ± 0.3 pF (n = 65), corresponding to a membrane surface area of ~940 μm2.
Quantitative RT-PCR
Samples were prepared using a modified isolation protocol, as described previously48. 
Briefly, capillary branches were isolated and prepared using the Ambion Single Cell-to-CT 
kit for RT-qPCR (ThermoFisher Scientific, Grand Island, NY, USA). Reactions were then 
prepared using TaqMan gene expression MasterMix (ThermoFisher Scientific) and primers 
for KIR2.1 (Kcnj2; RefSeq NM_008425.4) and eNOS (Nos3; RefSeq NM_008713.4) 
(ThermoFisher Scientific). Transcripts were preamplified for 14 cycles prior to RT-qPCR, as 
per the manufacturer’s instructions, followed by 40 cycles of qPCR for transcripts of 
interest. No-template controls were included in all conditions. To account for the possible 
presence of non-ECs in capillary samples, we normalized Kcnj2 expression in capillaries to 
expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (Nos3).
Isolated pressurized parenchymal arterioles and CaPA preparation
The CaPA extension of our routinely used pressurized arteriolar preparation21–23 in mice 
was obtained by dissecting parenchymal arterioles arising from the M1 region of the middle 
cerebral artery, leaving the attached capillary bed intact. Precapillary arteriolar segments 
were cannulated on glass micropipettes on a Living Systems Instrumentation (USA) 
pressure myograph, with one end occluded by a tie. The ends of the capillaries were then 
sealed by the downward pressure of an overlying glass micropipette. Application of pressure 
(40 mm Hg) to the cannulated parenchymal arteriole segment in this preparation pressurized 
the entire tree and induced myogenic tone in the parenchymal arteriole segment, as 
previously described for parenchymal arterioles without capillaries21–23. With this 
preparation, vasoactive substances were applied at specific points along the capillary-
arteriole continuum by pressure ejection from a glass micropipette (tip diameter, 5 ± 1 μm; n 
= 16) attached to a Picospritzer III (Parker, USA) at 5 ± 2 psi (n = 16) for 18 s (unless 
otherwise noted). Luminal diameter in parenchymal arterioles was acquired simultaneously 
in two different regions of the arteriolar segment at 15 Hz using IonWizard 6.2 edge-
detection software (IonOptix, USA). Changes in arteriolar diameter were calculated from the 
average luminal diameter measured over the last 10 s of stimulation.
Membrane potential
For SM membrane potential recordings, parenchymal arterioles, with attached capillary 
ramifications, were pressurized to 40 mm Hg, as described above. After development of 
myogenic tone, myosin light chain kinase was inhibited with 800 nM wortmannin to prevent 
movement artifacts. Myocytes were then impaled with glass microelectrodes filled with 0.5 
M KCl (tip resistance, 200–250 MΩ). A WPI Intra 767 amplifier was used for recording 
membrane potential. Analog output from the amplifier was obtained using AxoScope 
(Molecular Devices) software (sampling frequency, 417 Hz). Criteria for accepting 
recordings were (i) an abrupt negative deflection of potential as the microelectrode was 
advanced into the cell, (ii) stable membrane potential for at least 1 min, and (iii) an abrupt 
change in potential to ~0 mV after retracting the electrode from the cell.

 Fluorescence staining
CaPA preparations were prepared from brain tissue isolated from Acta2-GCaMP5-mCherry 
mice and incubated with FITC-conjugated isolectin B4 (10 μg/mL) in aCSF for 30 min. 
Fluorescence was visualized with an Andor Revolution confocal system (Andor Technology, 
UK) equipped with an upright 10x objective (NA 0.25) and CCD camera.
In vivo imaging of cerebral hemodynamics
Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane (5% induction, 2% maintenance). Upon obtaining 
surgical-plane anesthesia, the skull was exposed and a stainless steel head plate was attached 
over the left hemisphere using a mixture of dental cement and superglue. The head plate was 
secured in a holding frame, and a small (~2-mm diameter) circular cranial window was 
drilled in the skull above the somatosensory cortex. Approximately 300 μL of a 1-mg/mL 
solution of FITC (molecular weight, 2000 kDa) in saline was injected via the tail vein to 
allow visualization of the cerebral vasculature and contrast imaging of RBCs. Upon 
conclusion of surgery, isoflurane anesthesia was replaced with α-chloralose (50 mg/kg) and 
urethane (750 mg/kg). Body temperature was maintained at 37°C throughout the experiment 
using an electric heating pad. Penetrating arterioles were first identified by observing RBCs 
flowing into the brain (as opposed to out of the brain via venules), and capillaries 
downstream of arterioles were selected for study. A pipette was next introduced into the 
solution covering the exposed cortex, and the duration and pressure of ejection were 
calibrated (200–300 ms, 8 ± 1 psi; n = 59) to obtain a small solution plume (radius, ~10 μm). 
The pipette was maneuvered into the cortex and positioned adjacent to the capillary under 
study (mean depth, 73 ± 6 μm; n = 19), after which agents were ejected directly onto the 
capillary. Placement of the pipette in the brain as described restricted agent delivery to the 
capillary under study and caused minimal displacement of the surrounding tissue (Fig. 3d 
and Supplementary Movies 2 and 3). Spatial coverage of the ejected solution was monitored 
by including tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate (TRITC, 150 kDa; 0.2 mg/mL)-labeled 
dextran. RBC velocity and flux data were collected by line scanning the capillary of interest 
at 5 kHz. For experiments in which KIR channels or neural activity were blocked, 100 μM 
BaCl2 or 3 μM tetrodotoxin in aCSF, respectively, was applied to the cranial surface for a 
minimum of 20 min to allow penetration. Whisker stimulation was performed using a 
piezoelectric actuator driven by a waveform generator coupled to an amplifier (Piezo 
Master; Viking Industrial Products). Whiskers were stimulated at a frequency of 4 Hz for 1 
min with a total deflection of 5 mm. Images were acquired through a Zeiss 20x Plan 
Apochromat 1.0 NA DIC VIS-IR water-immersion objective mounted on a Zeiss LSM-7 
multiphoton microscope (Zeiss, USA) coupled to a Coherent Chameleon Vision II Titanium-
Sapphire pulsed infrared laser (Coherent, USA). FITC and TRITC were excited at 820 nm, 
and emitted fluorescence was separated through 500–550 and 570–610 nm bandpass filters, 
respectively.
Laser Doppler flowmetry
Functional hyperemia in the whisker barrel cortex was measured using laser Doppler 
flowmetry, as previously described27. Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane (5% induction, 
2% maintenance). At the conclusion of surgery, isoflurane anesthesia was withdrawn and

 replaced with α-chloralose (50 mg/kg) and urethane (750 mg/kg). Body temperature was 
monitored with a rectal probe and maintained at 37°C by a servo-controlled heating pad. The 
femoral artery was catheterized for mean arterial pressure recording and blood gas 
measurement (Supplementary Table 2). The head was immobilized using a stereotactic 
frame and the cisterna magna was punctured to relieve intracranial pressure, after which a 2 
× 2 mm cranial window was prepared over the whisker barrel cortex. The window was 
continuously superfused with aCSF, and a laser Doppler flow probe (Perimed) was placed 
over the window for CBF measurement. Arterial pressure and CBF were recorded using 
PowerLab software (AD Instruments), and were allowed to equilibrate for 30 min before 
experimentation. Functional hyperemia was assessed by stimulating contralateral whiskers. 
Whiskers were stimulated at a frequency of ~4 Hz for 1 min. Ba2+ (100 μM) was delivered 
via the cranial window superfusate.
In vivo electrophysiology
Local field potentials (LFPs) in the whisker barrel cortex were recorded essentially as 
previously described49. Briefly, a cranial window was prepared as described above, after 
which a 2 × 4 array of tetrodes (25 μm Nichrome wire, AM–Systems Inc., USA) was 
implanted in the whisker barrel cortex. A ground wire was implanted over the cerebellum 
through a separate (~0.5 × 0.5 mm) window. Neuronal activity was recorded in response to 
contralateral whisker stimulation. Signals were pre-amplified x 1 at the headstage, and were 
sampled at 30 kHz and filtered at 1–9000 Hz (Neuralynx, MT, USA). All LFP signals were 
referenced against the ground wire placed above the cerebellum. Whiskers were stimulated 
manually at a frequency of ~4–6 Hz for 1 min. Ba2+ (100 μM) was delivered in aCSF via the 
cranial window superfusate.
Data analysis
Patch-clamp data were analyzed using Clampfit 9.2 software. In diameter and membrane 
potential experiments, response onset was measured for deflections from baseline > 5%. 
Changes in arteriolar diameter were calculated from the average luminal diameter measured 
over the last 10 s of stimulation. RBC flux and velocity were analyzed offline using ImageJ 
software. RBC velocity was calculated from measurements of the angle of each individual 
RBC appearing on the linescan. Flux data were binned at 1-s intervals. Mean baseline 
velocity and flux data for summary figures were obtained by averaging the baseline (~3 s) 
for each measurement prior to pressure ejection of 10 mM K+. The peak response was 
defined as the peak 1-s flux bin after delivery of K+ within the remaining scanning period 
(~17 s). Because flux and velocity are correlated, the average velocity of all cells in the peak 
flux bin was reported for velocity summary data. The distance from the site of pressure 
ejection to the feed arteriole was estimated using the Pythagorean theorem applied to manual 
measurements taken along the x-, y-, and z-axes of z-stack image series taken of the local 
vasculature at the time of pipette placement. The depth of capillaries below the surface was 
estimated from z-stack series acquired prior to pipette placement. The CBF response to 
whisker stimulation was quantified by calculating the total area under the curve of the CBF 
trace during the 60-s whisker stimulation period. LFPs were analyzed with custom written 
software using the Matlab Signal Processing and Chronux50 toolboxes and were initially 
notch filtered to remove 60 Hz noise. Spectrograms were computed from fast Fourier

 transforms. Whisker stimulation reliably evoked clear oscillations between approximately 4 
and 6 Hz and therefore we focused our analysis primarily on this band of interest, assessing 
mean frequency and signal magnitude in 8 s epochs starting 10 s after the stimulus onset. We 
also analyzed the mean frequency and peak magnitude of oscillations in 0–4 and 6–20 Hz 
bands.
Statistics
Statistical testing was performed using Graphpad Prism 6 software. Data are expressed as 
means ± SEM, and a P-value ≤ 0.05 was considered significant. Stars denote significant 
differences, ‘n.s.’ indicates non-significant comparisons. Statistical tests are noted in figure 
legends. All t-tests were two-sided. All data passed the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for 
normality. No statistical methods were used to pre-determine sample sizes, and experiments 
were repeated to adequately reduce confidence intervals and avoid errors in statistical 
testing. Sample size estimation was predicated on similar experiments performed previously 
in our laboratory. Data collection and analysis were not performed blind to the conditions of 
the experiments. Randomization was not performed and exclusions were not made.

Capillary ECs possess functional KIR channels, but lack SK and IK channels. (A) Overview 
of cell isolation. Left to right: Two brain slices were homogenized then filtered to yield 
branching capillaries. Extracellular matrix was enzymatically removed and capillaries were 
triturated to yield single cells. Scale bar applies to all micrographs. (B) With 60 mM [K+]o to 
increase KIR conductance, a 200-ms voltage ramp from −140 to +50 mV (lower inset) 
generated whole-cell currents (black trace) with a large inward component at hyperpolarized 
potentials. Superfusion of 100 μM Ba2+ (red trace) eliminated evoked currents. (C) 
Subtracted 100 μM Ba2+-sensitive currents reveal a classic strongly rectifying K+ current. 
(D) 100 μM Ba2+ (blue) was without effect on capillary ECs from EC KIR2.1−/− mice. (E) 
Subtracted 100 μM Ba2+-sensitive current from the KIR2.1−/− capillary EC in D. (F) 
Comparison of Ba2+-sensitive capillary EC current density at −140 mV in WT C57BL/6 (n 
= 8 cells, 8 mice) and EC KIR2.1−/− (n = 7 cells, 7 mice) mice (***P = 0.0005 (t13 = 4.587) 
unpaired Student’s t-test). (G) With 6 mM [K+]o and 300 nM [Ca2+]i, 1 μM NS309 had no 
effect on capillary EC currents. (H) Dialyzing with 3 μM Ca2+ did not affect membrane 
currents. (I) Summary data at 0 mV. NS309 (1 μM) had no effect on capillary ECs (cEC; n = 
5 cells, 3 mice), but evoked large currents in control pial ECs (pEC; n = 6 cells, 4 mice; *P = 
0.0253 (t9 = 2.678) unpaired Student’s t-test). Currents were absent in capillary ECs 
dialyzed with 3 μM [Ca2+]i (n = 7 cells, 2 mice), in contrast to pial ECs, which developed 
prominent K+ currents upon dialysis of 3 μM Ca2+ (n = 5 cells, 4 mice; **P = 0.0011 (t10 = 
4.548) unpaired Student’s t-test). Dialysis with a solution containing 0 Ca2+ and 5 mM 
EGTA had no effect on capillary EC currents compared with cells dialyzed with 300 nM or 
3 μM Ca2+ (n = 5 cells from 2 mice; P = 0.251 (FDFn,DFd = 1.5282,14) one-way ANOVA).

Application of K+ to capillaries causes rapid upstream parenchymal arteriole dilation ex 
vivo. (A) Left: CaPA preparations were obtained from the middle cerebral artery region. 
Right: Typical CaPA preparation from an Acta2 GCaMP5-mCherry mouse (see Online 
Methods) showing SM (red) giving way to branching capillaries (lectin; green). Each CaPA 
preparation consists of an arteriole segment (320 μm ± 14 μm long, n = 16) and a capillary 
tree composed of one first-order branch (168 ± 12 μm long) with an average of 4 ± 1 second-
order branches (100 ± 8 μm long). (B) Constriction of the arteriole to 40 mm Hg in a CaPA

 indicates the tip of the pipette. Diameter was simultaneously recorded in two zones (boxes). 
The average distance from the capillary stimulation site to Zone 1 was 226 ± 19 μm. (D) 
Arteriolar diameter at Zone 1 and Zone 2 in a CaPA preparation. Application of 10 mM 
K+ (5 psi) to capillaries produced rapid upstream arteriolar dilation, which was blocked by 
30 μM Ba2+. (E) Expanded trace showing parenchymal arteriole dilation at Zone 2 to 
capillary stimulation with 10 mM K+ for 18 s in preparations from WT C57BL/6 (black 
trace) and EC KIR2.1−/− (blue trace) mice. (F) Summary data showing diameter changes in 
Zone 2 induced by 10 mM K+ applied directly onto capillaries in WT preparations (n = 6 
preparations, 6 mice) before and after 30 μM Ba2+ and in EC KIR2.1−/− preparations (n = 5 
preparations, 5 mice; ***P < 0.0001, (FDFn,DFd = 154.82,14) one-way ANOVA followed by 
Tukey’s multiple comparisons test). (G) Membrane potential of SM cells at Zone 2 in a 
pressurized (40 mm Hg) arteriolar segment during application of 10 mM K+ onto capillaries. 
(H) Summary data showing membrane potential before and after application of 10 mM K+ 
for 18 s to capillaries (n = 5 preparations, 5 mice; ***P = 0.0002, (t4 = 12.94) paired 
Student’s t-test). (I) Effects of capillary application of 10, 25, and 60 mM external K+ on 
arteriolar diameter at Zone 1 and Zone 2. (J) Summary data showing diameter changes in 
Zone 1 and Zone 2 induced by 10, 25, and 60 mM K+ applied directly onto capillaries. 
Responses to 25 and 60 mM K+ compared to baseline diameter and between Zone 1 and 
Zone 2 were not significantly different (n = 6 preparations, 6 mice; baseline vs 25 mM K+: P 
= 0.1128, (t5 = 1.921); baseline vs 60 mM K+: P = 0.4984, (t5 = 0.7296); Zone 1 vs Zone 2: 
P = 0.3908, (t5 = 0.9390) at 25 mM K+, and P = 0.2580, (t5 = 1.276) at 60 mM K+, paired 
Student’s t-test). All error bars represent s.e.m.

K+ causes capillary hyperemia in vivo through KIR2.1 channel activation. (A) Experimental 
paradigm. Mice were injected with FITC-dextran, then equipped with a cranial window 
through which the cerebral circulation was visualized using 2-photon laser-scanning 
microscopy (2PLSM). (B) Depth-coded micrograph of an area of the cortical vasculature. 
Capillaries downstream of penetrating parenchymal arterioles were identified for further 
analysis. (C) A pipette containing aCSF with 3 or 10 mM K+ plus TRITC-dextran was 
introduced next to a capillary, which was then line-scanned at 5 kHz during local pressure 
ejection of the pipette contents. (D) Micrographs depicting (left to right) the evolution of 
TRITC diffusion (red) after pressure ejection of 10 mM K+ (200 ms, 4 psi) onto a capillary 
(green). The brevity and low pressure of the ejection conditions ensured that K+ remained 
local. (E) Left: Baseline and peak distance-time plots of capillary line scans showing 
hyperemia to the ejection of 10 mM K+ onto a capillary. RBCs passing through the line-
scanned capillary appear as black shadows against green fluorescent plasma. Right: Typical 
experimental time-course for a WT mouse showing RBC flux binned at 1-s intervals before 
and after pressure ejection of 10 mM K+ (300 ms, 8 psi; purple arrow) onto a capillary, 
demonstrating hyperemia to K+ delivery. (F) Left: Line scan plots for an experiment in 
which 10 mM K+ was pressure ejected onto a capillary in an EC KIR2.1−/− mouse, 
illustrating an absence of hyperemia to this maneuver. Right: Typical flux-time trace for an 
EC KIR2.1−/− mouse capillary. Pressure ejection of 10 mM K+ (300 ms, 8 psi; purple arrow) 
did not evoke hyperemia. (G) Summary RBC flux responses to 10 mM K+ in WT mice. K+ 
delivery caused significant hyperemia (n = 11 paired experiments, 11 mice; **P = 0.0038 
(t10 = 3.75) paired Student’s t-test). (H) Summary data for EC KIR2.1−/− mice (n = 9 paired

Student’s t-test). (I) Ba2+ (100 μM), applied to the cranial surface, inhibited capillary 
hyperemia to 10 mM K+ (n = 6 paired experiments, 6 mice; P > 0.99 (t5 = 0) paired 
Student’s t-test). (J) Change in RBC flux expressed as a percentage of baseline for each 
experimental group (*P = 0.016 vs. WT, FDFn,DFd = 4.9742,23, one-way ANOVA with Holm-
Sidak’s multiple comparison test). All error bars represent s.e.m.

10 mM K+ applied to capillaries causes upstream arteriolar dilation in vivo. (Ai) Micrograph 
illustrating pipette placement adjacent to a second-order capillary for in vivo monitoring of 
the diameter of the upstream feed arteriole (boxed). White dashed lines indicate that 
capillaries are connected into a single tree despite deviating from the imaging plane. (Aii) 
The same experiment, after pressure ejection of 10 mM K+ and TRITC (red) around the 
capillary. Note the dilation in the feed arteriole (boxed). (B) Magnification of the boxed 
areas around the feed arteriole in Ai and Aii, illustrating the magnitude of dilation evoked by 
capillary stimulation with 10 mM K+. (C) Traces illustrating the luminal diameter of a pre-
capillary arteriole (green) and the stimulated capillary (grey) before and after stimulation 
with 10 mM K+. Delivery of K+ produced a robust dilation in the arteriole, but not the 
capillary. (D) Summary data showing arteriole diameter before and after capillary 
application of 10 mM K+, which produced significant upstream arteriole dilation (n = 8 
paired experiments, 7 mice; ****P < 0.0001 (t7 = 10.86) paired Student’s t-test). (E) 
Summary data showing target capillary diameter before and after capillary application of 10 
mM K+, which had no effect (n = 18 capillaries, 7 mice P = 0.6014 (t17 = 0.5324) paired

EC KIR2.1 channels are essential for functional hyperemia. (A) Summary data for 15 mM 
K+-evoked hyperemia. Responses in WT mice were severely attenuated by 100 μM Ba2+. 
Responses in EC KIR2.1−/− mice were significantly smaller than those from WT mice and 
almost abrogated by 100 μM Ba2+ (WT, n = 6 mice; EC KIR2.1−/−, n = 5 mice. ****P < 
0.0001 (q18 = 9.033), **P = 0.0083 (q18 = 5.214), *P = 0.0187 (q18 = 4.676); two-way 
ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparisons test). (B) Left: Whisker stimulation 
experimental paradigm. Right: Typical traces illustrating the hyperemic response to whisker 
stimulation (WS), measured using laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF). Hyperemia in EC 
KIR2.1−/− mice (blue) was markedly blunted compared with that in WT mice (black). Black 
dashed lines represent baseline and peak WT response for comparison. (C) Summary data 
for functional hyperemia, indicating that responses in WT mice are driven by a substantial 
Ba2+-sensitive component, which is greatly diminished in EC KIR2.1−/− mice (WT, n = 7 
mice; EC KIR2.1−/−, n = 6 mice; ****P < 0.0001 (q22 = 14.3 WT vs. Ba2+, and 8.396 WT 
vs. EC KIR2.1−/−), *P = 0.0238 (q22 = 4.413); two-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple 
comparisons test). All error bars represent s.e.m.
