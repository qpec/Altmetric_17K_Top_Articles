AbstrAct
background Marital relationship quality has been 
suggested to have independent effects on cardiovascular 
health outcomes. This study investigates the association 
between changes in marital relationship quality and 
cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors in men.
Methods We used data from The Avon Longitudinal 
Study of Parents and Children, a prospective birth cohort 
study (Bristol, UK). Our baseline sample was restricted 
to married study fathers with baseline relationship and 
covariate data (n=2496). We restricted final analysis 
(n=620) to those with complete outcome, exposure and 
covariate data, who were married and confirmed the 
study child’s father at 6.4 years and 18.8 years after 
baseline. Relationship quality was measured at baseline 
and 6.4 years and operationalised as consistently good, 
improving, deteriorating or consistently poor relationship. 
We measured CVD risk factors of blood pressure, resting 
heart rate, body mass index, lipid profile and fasting 
glucose at 18.8 years after baseline.
results Improving relationships were associated with 
lower levels of low-density lipoprotein (−0.25 mmol/L, 
95% CI −0.46 to −0.03) and relative reduction of 
body mass index (−1.07 kg/m2, 95% CI −1.73 to 
−0.42) compared with consistently good relationships, 
adjusting for confounders. Weaker associations were 
found between improving relationships and total 
cholesterol (−0.24 mmol/L, 95% CI −0.48 to 0.00) and 
diastolic blood pressure (−2.24 mm Hg, 95% CI −4.59 
to +0.11). Deteriorating relationships were associated 
with worsening diastolic blood pressure (+2.74 mm Hg, 
95% CI 0.50 to 4.98).
conclusions Improvement and deterioration of 
longitudinal relationship quality appears associated with 
respectively positive and negative associations with a 
range of CVD risk factors.
IntroductIon
Recognition of an association between marital status 
and health outcomes in observational data is long-
standing.1–5 The extent to which this observed rela-
tionship is due to bias by selection into marriage or 
protective effects of partnership remains debated.6 7
Many mechanisms have been proposed to explain 
how marital quality might confer health benefits,8 
but ‘supporting’9 10 positive behaviours or ‘buff-
ering’9 stress are common themes. It follows that 
longitudinal relationship quality is a more incisive 
proxy for how ‘supportive’ or ‘stress-buffering’ a 
relationship is over time, than representations of 
marital quality at a single point.
Studies of the effects of relationship quality within 
marriages control for marriage selection, allowing 
investigation of the protective effects of partnership 
in isolation.8 The majority of studies addressing the 
effects of marital quality on health have focused on 
cardiovascular disease (CVD). This is due primarily 
to the burden of CVD11 and our understanding of 
the role of modifiable risk factors.12
Most studies of marital quality and CVD risk 
measure quality at a single point8 and are unable 
to examine the importance of temporal changes 
in relationship quality. Only two studies have 
investigated the effect of longitudinal changes in 
relationship quality on outcomes related to CVD 
risk.13 14 One studied women (n=413) finding 
those in higher quality marriages was found to have 
lower risk of developing the metabolic syndrome.14 
Another studied effects of relationship quality on 
dichotomous measures of CVD risk were such as 
hypertension, heart rate >80 bpm or C-reactive 
protein >3.0 
mg/L in women (n=459) and men 
(n=739).13 This study suggested some effects on 
women but not men and few associations persisted 
after adjustment for confounders.
The present study uses 19 years of data from the 
Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children 
(ALSPAC) to assess the association between longi-
tudinal marital relationship quality and a range of 
CVD risk factors in married men. Men were the 
focus of this study as they have greater CVD risk 
than women in middle age,15 and display detectable 
risk factor differences earlier. We predicted that if 
marital quality was important for CVD risk, we 
would observe better CVD risk profiles in those 
with consistently better relationships, and changes 
in relationship quality over time (either getting 
worse or better) would be associated with similar 
changes in risk factor profiles after a sufficient 
latency period.

available online (www.

14 
541 pregnant women from in and around Bristol (UK) with 
estimated delivery dates between 1 April 1991 and 31 December 
1992. There were 14 
062 live births, and the children, the 
mothers and the mothers’ partners (referred to as ‘male part-
ners’) have been studied to the present day. The male partners’ 
data are the focus of this paper. The baseline (T1) sample is 
restricted to men who were married, reported being the father 
of the ALSPAC child, and had T1 relationship and covariate 
data. Male partners were excluded from the final analysis if 
they were lost to follow-up, lacked complete outcome, expo-
sure or covariate data, or were not married and confirmed as the 
study child’s biological father at 6.4 years (T2) and 18.8 years 
(T3) after T1. Ethical approval was obtained from ALSPAC 
Ethics and Law Committee, Local Research Ethics Committees 
and National Health Service National Research Ethics Service 
Committee (North West – Haydock). Full references for ALSPAC 
study ethics approval are available online.17
exposure
Longitudinal relationship quality was measured using the 12-item 
‘care’ subscale of the ‘measure of intimate bonds’ scale18 at T1 
when the men had a mean age of 34 years and 6.4 years later at 
T2. We chose not to use the ‘control’ subscale of this instrument, 
as conceptually it was unclear whether relationships with high or 
low control were better or worse. The care subscale uses a Likert 
scale from 0 to 3 to rate agreement with 12 statements regarding 
relationship quality, a higher score indicates a better relationship. 
Due to marked skewness, we grouped data into tertiles and cate-
gorised a good relationship as being in tertiles 2 or 3, and a poor 
relationship as tertile 1. As we had repeat data at two time points 
(T1, T2), we derived the following four patterns (figure 1): (a) 
consistently good (good at T1 and T2), (b) improving relation-
ships (poor at T1 and good at T2), (c) deteriorating relationships 
(good at T1 and poor at T2), (d) consistently poor relationships 
(poor at T1 and T2).
Main outcome measures
We hypothesised that there would be a latency period between 
changes in marital quality and CVD risk factors so these were 
measured in the subsequent follow-up period (T3), 18.8 years 
after T1 and during a 2-hour ALSPAC clinic session between 
September 2011 and February 2013. Fasting blood samples 
(minimum 8 
hours) were analysed for total cholesterol, high-den-
sity lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein 
(LDL) cholesterol, triglycerides and fasting glucose, all measured 
in mmol/L. Resting heart rate, recorded in beats/min, and mean 
seated systolic blood pressure (BP) and diastolic BP
, recorded in 
mm Hg, were measured by two readings from a single arm using 
an Omron M6 BP/Pulse monitor. Body mass index (BMI) was 
calculated at T3 (weight (kg)/height (m)2); weight was measured 
with Tanita scales (TBF401-A) and recorded to the nearest 
0.1 
kg, and height was measured to the nearest 1 
mm using a 
Harpenden stadiometer.
confounders and intermediaries
Potential confounders were age measured at T1, height measured 
objectively at T3 (short stature is associated with increased CVD 
risk)19 and adult socioeconomic position (SEP). Three measures 
of self-reported SEP were included: housing tenure 3 years after 
T1, highest educational qualification 3 years prior to T1 and 
financial difficulties with common expenditures (range 0–40 
with higher score indicating worse outcome) at T1 (catego-
rised in quartiles). We did not adjust for baseline smoking and 
alcohol in our main models for the following reasons. Alcohol 
consumption could be both a confounder and intermediary 
as heavy drinking may lead to worse marital quality but simi-
larly worse marital quality may lead to heavier drinking; hence 
adjustment may underestimate the association. While smoking is 
associated with other CVD risk factors, it was not clear how it 
would be itself determined by marital quality other than via its 
association with socioeconomic status, which has been adjusted 
for. A sensitivity analysis adjusting for smoking and alcohol was 
undertaken to evidence our approach. Smoking was quantified 
using self-report of number of cigarettes smoked a day at T1 
(none, 1–9, 10–19, 20+). Alcohol consumption was measured 
by self-reported approximate unit consumption at T1.
We hypothesised that a poor relationship may lead to a 
less healthy diet and/or less physical activity with subsequent 
increased obesity, so BMI (measured at T3) was identified as the 
main potential mediator. To examine how BMI at T3 may have 
changed from T1, we used self-reported height and weight prior 
to T1 as a proxy for T1 BMI.
statistical methods
Baseline characteristics of the selected and excluded sample were 
analysed using Χ2 tests for discrete, and t-tests for continuous 
variables. Associations between both T1 relationship quality and 
longitudinal relationship quality patterns with CVD risk factor 
outcomes were analysed using regression models adjusting for: 
(1) age, (2) age and confounders, and (3) age, confounders and 
intermediaries. For the BMI outcome, we examined associa-
tions with CVD risk factors both without and with adjustment 
for BMI prior to T1, the latter allowing assessment of relative 
change in BMI over the study period.
sensitivity analyses
We used multiple imputation using chained equations in 
post-hoc sensitivity analysis of the association between T1 rela-
tionship quality and CVS risk factor outcomes, whereby missing 
T1 exposure and covariate data were imputed for the sub-group 
of participants with complete outcome data at T3 (50 datasets 
imputed). As some of the men in the study reported that they 
had treated hypertension we repeated the BP analysis but added 
10 
and 5 
mm Hg to the observed systolic and diastolic pressures

respectively to approximate underlying BP without treatment20 21 
for the regression analyses of longitudinal relationship quality 
and CVD risk factor outcomes. We also repeated our main anal-
yses adjusting for marital quality at T3 to account for changes 
in relationship quality from T2 to T3, however, the temporal 
sequence between the risk factor and current marital quality is 
less clear as these were measured at the same time. Finally, we 
repeated our main analysis adjusting for smoking and alcohol 
consumption at T1.
results
From our original sample of 2496, we had a complete case sample 
of 620 (25%) (figure 2). A large proportion of the ‘excluded’ 
sample was comprised those with incomplete T2 exposure data 
(25%), and those for whom a lack of contact details prevented 
invitation to the T3 clinic (24%). Prior to T3, communication 
with these men was via the index child’s mother. Men in the 
excluded sample were slightly younger, had greater adiposity, 
were of lower educational level, had more financial difficulties 
and worse marital quality (table 1). Relationship quality at T1 
(being in a poor rather than good relationship) was a predictor 
of divorce or separation at T3 (11.9% vs 4.75%, p=0.002). 
There was no association (p=0.767) between levels of ‘control’ 
in a relationship at T1 and relationship status (divorce/separa-
tion and so on) at T3, evidencing the methodological decision 
to use the ‘care’ subscale of the ‘measure of intimate bonds’18 to 
represent relationship quality.
We found few differences in the age-adjusted CVD risk factor 
outcomes at T3 when comparing good and poor relationship 
at T1 (table 2) except for LDL cholesterol, which was para-
doxically lower for those in poor relationships, and the change 
in BMI from T1 where those in poor relationships were less 
likely to put on weight (table 2 Model 1). Conditioning for 
confounders made little difference to these estimates (table 2 
Model 2). Post-hoc sensitivity analysis through multiple imputa-
tion using chained equations (n=620 in original complete case 
versus n=876 in imputed sample) led to a slight attenuation of 
the observed relationship between T1 relationship quality and 
change in BMI measured at T3 (p=0.008 
to 0.02) and T3 LDL 
(p=0.05 
to 0.08), other associations were unchanged.
We found that men with persistent poor-quality relation-
ships had very small adverse differences in their CVD risk 
factors compared with those with persistently good relation-
ships but these were all consistent with chance sampling vari-
ability (table 3). Clearer patterns emerged for those with either 
improving or deteriorating marital quality. Both systolic and 
diastolic BPs went down or up in line with improving or dete-
riorating marital quality compared with those with persistent 
good relationships, though only the increase in diastolic BP 
(2.74 mm Hg, 95% CI 0.50 to 4.98) was unlikely to be due 
to chance. Those with improving relationships also showed 
lower total cholesterol mainly through effects on LDL choles-
terol (−0.25 mmol/L, 95% CI −0.46 to −0.03). Change in 
both these risk factors for the improving quality group may 
have been driven by weight loss (change in BMI −1.07 kg/m2, 
95% CI −1.73 to −0.42 kg/m2). Weaker effects on increasing 
BMI were seen for the deteriorating marital quality group 
(change in BMI 0.53 kg/m2, 95% CI −0.09 to 1.15 kg/m2 
p=0.09). When we repeated our analysis conditioning on 
T3 BMI as a potential intermediary (online supplementary 
etable 1), we found minimal differences in the association with 
diastolic BP (p=0.04, rather than 0.02) and LDL cholesterol 
(p=0.02, rather than 0.03).
Sensitivity analyses accounting for the effects of medically 
treated BP (online supplementary etable 2) increased the mean 
effect size in the deteriorating relationship group on diastolic BP 
(2.95 
mm Hg, 95% 
CI 0.53 to 5.36 
mm Hg) though it slightly 
weakened the effect for the improving quality group. Further 
adjustment for marital quality at T3 (online supplementary etable 
3) made little difference to the association between relationship 
quality and diastolic BP or change in BMI. However, accounting 
for T3 relationship quality did attenuate the association between 
improving relationship quality and LDL (p=0.09, rather than 
p=0.03). Further sensitivity analysis adjusting for smoking and

alcohol consumption made little difference to the results from 
the main confounder model (online supplementary etable 4).
dIscussIon
Married men have been shown to have reduced CVD mortality 
and morbidity, though the reasons for this remain unclear. This 
is the first study to assess the association between repeated 
measures of marital relationship quality and a broad range of 
CVD risk factors over two decades. Overall, among married 
men there were only very modest benefits in terms of CVD 
risk factors, if at all, when comparing men in persistently good 
or bad relationships. However, changes in marital quality had 
positive or negative effects on lipids and BP
, as we had predicted 
a priori, and a modest degree of this may have been mediated 
through changes in adiposity (online supplementary etable 1). 
These findings were little changed after adjustment for measures 
of socioeconomic status. Traditionally, beneficial effects of 
marital status were thought to be mediated by either health 
selection, confounding by socioeconomic status, or psychosocial 
mechanisms. The latter argument has been used to support the 
observation that men appear to gain more benefit than women, 
as women have larger social networks and are less dependent on 
their partner than men.22 An alternative explanation relates to 
shared environment. Data from the English Longitudinal Study 
of Ageing (ELSA) found that men and women are more likely 
to make a positive health behaviour change if their partner also 
changes their behaviour.10 It seems reasonable to assume that 
this effect might be modified by the quality of the relationship. 
This is consistent with our findings for changes in BMI which 
are known to have greater effects on altering BP than lipids as 
shown by the Look AHEAD randomised controlled trial.23 The 
similarity of CVD risk factors for men in persistently good and 
bad marriages suggests a number of possibilities; that quality of 
marital relationship is unimportant; that there could be some 
habituation after a period of time—so the emotional effects of 
marital quality are no longer salient or reporting bias. Interest-
ingly, the UK million women study failed to find any association 
between happiness and ischaemic heart disease mortality after 
appropriate adjustment, suggesting that a simplistic psychosocial 
explanation may be inadequate.24 Alternatively, reporting marital 
status at one time point, rather than many as in the present study, 
may be a better measure of a personality trait (‘glass half empty 
or half full’) rather than marital quality per se, which is better 
captured by relative changes over time. If personality trait is 
itself unrelated to CVD risk factors, then this would mask true 
differences by marital quality.
There are only two comparative studies. Troxel et al14 measured 
relationship quality at baseline and after 3 years in 321 women 
from the Pittsburgh Healthy Women Study. They reported pres-
ence or absence of ‘metabolic syndrome’, at approximately 11.5 
years, finding women in dissatisfying marriages to be at higher 
risk. They measured three relationship trajectories, representing 
(a) consistent satisfaction, (b) consistent dissatisfaction, and (c) 
change in marital satisfaction in either direction (rather than the 
direction of change), and hence it is not possible to compare 
their findings with those of the present study. A more recent 
paper by Liu and Waite13 also investigated the effect of longitu-
dinal relationship quality on binary measures of CVD risk using 
outcomes of the presence or the absence of hypertension (both 
measured or self reported), ‘rapid heart rate’ defined as a heart 
rate >80 bpm and C-reactive protein >3 
mg/L over 5 years of 
follow-up in a cohort of 739 married men and 459 women. For 
women, they found that worsening relationships were associated 
with more adverse CVD risk factors though the effects were 
more marked at older ages. For men their results were weak and 
inconsistent from which they argued that men may be less likely 
to internalise a poor relationship than women.
The breadth of data available through the ALSPAC study 
enabled us to examine marital quality data at three time 
points over 19 years and test associations with CVD risk 
factors, while adjusting for several measures of socioeco-
nomic status. However, there has been participant attrition 
over the course of the study with likely loss to follow-up 
bias and a consequent reduction of power. As expected, men 
who were excluded from the analysis were more likely to be 
poorer, drink more alcohol and have worse marital quality

at T1. Wives in poor relationships may have been less likely 
to ask their partners to attend the follow-up clinic and hence 
would be missing. Those whose marriage dissolved prior to or 
during the study were excluded. These biases would system-
atically attenuate any true relationship so that our observed 
findings may underestimate the true effect. However, our 
imputation analyses resulted in a modest attenuation of 
effects suggesting that men with missing covariates who had 
outcomes at T3 had weaker associations with marital quality. 
As our study looked at men, these findings may not be gener-

What this study adds
 
► Improvement and deterioration of longitudinal relationship 
quality appears to be associated with respectively positive 
and negative associations with a broad range of objectively 
measured cardiovascular disease risk factors.
 
► Further research needs to determine if effective marriage 
counselling, or when appropriate, abandoning a deteriorating 
relationship, has longer term physical health benefits over 
and above psychological well-being.

relationships, though did have predictive validity in terms of 
future divorce risk. We tested multiple CVD risk factors so 
it is possible that some of the associations are type I errors.
We used a question on marital status as a marker of a 
long-term partnership, though it is unclear whether the 
same effects would have been seen with cohabitation or 
whether marriage has additional effects. This is important 
as marriage and cohabitation trends in developed countries 
have changed substantially in the last 50 years, with cohab-
iting in the UK doubling between 1996 and 2012.25
Changes in the quality of a marital relationship appear to 
predict CVD risk, though consistently good or poor rela-
tionship groups were not very different. At this stage, it is 
unclear whether these patterns will be reflected in actual 
rates of disease onset as the cohort is still relatively young. 
Assuming a causal association, then marriage counselling 
for couples with deteriorating relationships may have added 
benefits in terms of physical health over and above psycho-
logical well-being, though in some cases ending the relation-
ship may be the best outcome.

What is already known on this subject
 
► Associations between marital status and cardiovascular 
disease (CVD) morbidity have long been observed in cohort 
studies, however it is debated whether this is causal or due 
to selection bias.
 
► Analysing effects of changes in relationship quality within 
marriages controls for selection, providing stronger evidence 
to assess for an association.
 
► Only two small studies have investigated the association 
between changes in marital relationship quality and 
CVD-related risk factor outcomes, with unclear findings due 
to difficulty measuring longitudinal changes in relationship 
quality and binary representations of CVD risk outcome 
measures.
