Although concussion is one of the greatest health challenges today, our physical understanding of
the cause of injury is limited. In this paper, we simulated football head impacts in a finite element
model and extracted the most dominant modal behavior of brain’s deformation. We showed that
brain’s deformation is most sensitive in low frequency regimes close to 30Hz, and discovered that
for most sub-concussive head impacts, the dynamics of brain deformation is dominated by a single
global mode. In this Letter, we show the existence of localized modes and multi-modal behavior in
the brain as a hyper-viscoelastic medium. This dynamical phenomenon leads to strain concentration
patterns, particularly in deep brain regions, which is consistent with reported concussion pathology.
Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major cause of death
and disability in the United States, contributing to about
30% of all injury-related deaths [1, 2]. Every year, mil-
lions of Americans are diagnosed with TBI [3, 4], 80%
of which are categorized as mild [2]. Undiagnosed cases,
due to either lack of clinical expertise or underreport-
ing, might be twice as high [5–8]. Given that mild TBI
(mTBI), or concussion, has become a serious health con-
cern in the society, the burden of understanding and pre-
venting it has become ever more indisputable for clini-
cians and physicists alike.
Efforts to model the brain’s physics date back to the
1940’s when Holbourn proposed the head as a mechani-
cal system and explored the relation between the input
to this system (in the form of head motion) to the output
(in the form of relative brain displacement) [9, 10]. Ko-
rnhauser proposed iso-displacement curves in a second-
order spring-mass system representing relative brain dis-
placement as a measure for classifying injury [11]. Oth-
ers have also showed that, in different loading regimes,
injury could be more sensitive to peak acceleration or
maximum change in velocity or a combination of both
[12, 13]. Since then, many scientists have investigated
brain’s response in severe scenarios of TBI with skull
flexure [14, 15], and more recently in mild scenarios with
mostly inertial loading on the brain [16–18]. In particu-
lar, for helmeted sports, much of previous research has fo-
cused on brain deformation while assuming a rigid skull.
In time, with the advances in imaging techniques, axonal
injury, which requires excessive regional stretching of ax-
ons [19, 20], has become one of the leading hypotheses
behind the mechanism of concussions. Confirming this
hypothesis, strain in the brain and specifically strain in
the periventricular region of the brain – with the high-
est density of axon fibers – have been shown to correlate
best with acute concussion and long-term neurological
deficits [21–24]. However, dynamical behavior of brain
during rapid head motions with various amplitudes, du-
rations and directions, as well as the reason for higher
susceptibility of these deep regions of brain to strain are
still largely unknown [22, 25].
As a complex dynamical system with an intricate ge-
ometry, non-uniformly compliant boundary conditions
and significantly inhomogeneous material properties, un-
derstanding the mechanical characteristics of brain re-
quires a multifaceted approach that takes into account
both the spatial and temporal aspects of this system.
A force impulse on the head creates nonlinear traveling
shear waves inside brain, which propagate at different
speeds and attenuate at different rates, and can create
localized strain concentrations at different regions of a
linear [26] and nonlinear [27] viscoelastic medium. Gur-
djian et al. observed that shear strains were developed
within the brain, which were concentrated in the vicinity
of the brainstem [28]. A similar behavior was observed
in the corpus callosum region, which interfaces with stiff
ventricular or membranous structures. Relatively rigid
structures inside the head, e.g. falx cerebri and tento-
rium cerebelli, are also highly influential in reflecting or
redirecting the shear waves [29, 30].
In addition to the spatial distribution of these shear
waves, our understanding of their temporal dynamics is
rather limited. This is an important gap in knowledge
especially since impact biomechanics of the brain is by-
and-large a transient phenomenon, spanning a few to
a hundred milliseconds [22, 31]. Previous studies have
shown a strong dependence of brain motion and defor-
mation on the frequency of the input loading [32–36].
Margulies et.
al showed that the maximum strain in-
duced in a brain surrogate material had a strong depen-
dence on the frequency of the applied head motion with
peak values occurring near 25Hz [37, 38]. Most recently,
using a lumped-parameter model validated with tagged-
MRI measurements and cadaveric impact experiments,
 2
we modeled the governing dynamics of the brain in the
sagittal plane and discovered an amplified global behav-
ior for relative brain motion at around 20Hz [35].
In this Letter, we study the spatiotemporal character-
istics of brain deformation during athletic events.
By
leveraging mode decomposition techniques, we demon-
strate localized dynamical phenomena during brain tis-
sue deformation and report on its implications on injury
assessment and preventive equipment design.
Modal analysis is widely used in structural and fluid
mechanics, as well as biomedical signal analysis to extract
modal behavior of a data sequence in the absence of an
underlying model [39–41]. Here we used Dynamic Mode
Decomposition (DMD), which is a multi-variate method
developed to reduce the dimensionality of a given time-
series dataset [42]. DMD gives a compact representation
of the original dataset by computing a set of indepen-
dent modes, each oscillating at a fixed frequency. It can
give the system’s characteristics such as energy and decay
rate.
In order to understand how DMD works, we consider
a temporal sequence of brain’s nodal displacement fields,
U(x, y, z, t), where x, y, z are the spatial location of each
node considered at time t.
Assume that we have N
equally spaced snapshots of M nodes, which in this case
translates to 3 × M degrees of freedom in each snapshot.
Using the DMD definition, we decompose the displace-
ment fields into the following form:
U(x, y, z, t) =
N
�
n=1
an exp (λnt)φn(x, y, z)
(1)
such that UN
1
= {u1, u2, . . . , uN}.
Here, an is the
modal coefficient, λn is the complex modulus, and φn
is the spatial distribution of each mode. The main as-
sumption in DMD is that each snapshot in time is as-
sumed as a linear combination of the previous snap-
shots such that uj+1 = Auj, which in turn leads to
UN
1
= {u1, Au1, . . . , AN−1u1}. The goal here is to ex-
tract the dynamic characteristics, i.e., eigenvalues and
eigenvectors of the dynamical process described by A,
which is a large square matrix of size 3M × N. As the
number of grid nodes increases, so does the size of this
matrix. In order to avoid forming this large matrix A, a
companion matrix ˜
S = HT AH is formed instead through
singular value decomposition (SVD), where H is the left
singular vectors of U. By using the eigenvectors of ˜
S, the
dynamic modes can be represented as:
Ψ = UN−1
1
T
(2)
where Tj are the left eigenvectors of ˜
S. In the follow-
ing sections, we will utilize frequency (ωj = Re(λn)),
decay rate (ζj = Im(λn)) and amplitude (|Ψj|) of these
dynamic modes. λns are calculated by using the eigen-
values of ˜
S. For a more complete description of the DMD
methodology, please refer to [42, 43].

Other dimension reduction techniques such as Proper
Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) have been used in
structural mechanics, where spatial structure of the
modes are extracted based on the system’s statistically
steady-state response [44].
A crucial advantage DMD
has over these energy-ranking methods is that, unlike
DMD, they might lose valuable phase information since
they utilize energy ranking schemes and are not able to
give temporal and spatial separation [42]. We performed
a quantitative comparison between DMD and POD and
showed that for a highly transient event, such as a head
impact during football games, DMD is better equipped
to capture the presence of intrinsic nonlinearities in con-
trast to POD, which predicts invariant spatial substruc-
tures for different loading conditions (See Supplementary
Figure S4).
To investigate brain’s response in real-world head im-
pact conditions, we used our lab’s previously published
head kinematics from athletic events [22]. We have col-
lected 537 head impact kinematics by instrumenting 31
athletes, two of whom sustained concussions: one suf-
fered loss of consciousness (LOC), and the other self-
reported subtle post-concussive symptoms. The recorded
rotational and linear acceleration magnitudes and peak
frequencies (representing impulse durations) span a large
range with no apparent clustering patterns (See Supple-

mentary Figure S1B,C). To capture the dynamic char-
acteristics of the complex nonlinear brain-skull system,
we randomly selected and simulated a subset of 187 non-
injury collisions and the two injury collisions using the
KTH FE model (See Supplementary videos S1 and S2
for the LOC case).
Having simulated the local brain tissue deformations
with the above skull kinematics, we applied DMD to
extract the dominant spatiotemporal characteristics of
brain’s nodal displacements, which we can represent as
a combination of modes that oscillate and decay at the
corresponding modal frequencies and decay rates. As an
example, we show brain’s modal behavior for the LOC
case in Figure 1. The first mode oscillates at 28Hz and
decays with a rate of 18.4s−1, whereas the third mode os-
cillates at 42Hz and decays with a rate of 29.4s−1. Note
that the displacements in the third mode appear and dis-
appear approximately twice in the one cycle of the first
mode shown here. The spatial distribution of the first
and third modes are apparent in the snapshots, where the
displacements initiate in the central region of the brain
and propagate outwards in the form of a torus (Figure
1A,B, Supplementary Figure S5 and videos S3-S5).
The correspondence of the Fourier modes with the
DMD modes is also quite interesting as explained in [45].
Fourier analysis of two arbitrarily chosen nodes, one at
the interface of white and gray matter (Node 1), with low
frequency dynamics, and one in the cerebellum (Node 2),
with higher frequency multi-modal dynamics, shows the
ability of DMD analysis to capture the Fourier modes of
each node (Figure 1C,D). It should be noted that DMD
has important advantages over Fourier analysis due to
its applicability to nonlinear and transient systems. In
the limit case of a linear system with periodic loading,
DMD can be simplified to Fourier analysis [46]. Since
our loading input is an impulse loading and our system
is both nonlinear and highly rate dependent, DMD seems
advantageous for modal decomposition.
We observed that in spite of brain’s geometrical com-
plexity and material nonlinearity, in the span of the load-
ing inputs studied here, several common characteristics
emerge.
The main observation from the DMD analy-
sis was that brain’s displacement modes are amplified in
a frequency regime around 30Hz (Figure 2A). Here the
amplified modal amplitudes indicate that brain is more
susceptible to vibrations in the 20-40Hz range. In Fig-
ure 2A, the dashed line represents the mean values for
all the simulations and the shaded region represents the
standard error of the mean for the global brain modes.
To compare the effect of the direction of head rotation
on the frequency content of these modes, we categorized
each football case with respect to their corresponding
“dominant” rotation direction, defined as the direction
with highest rotational acceleration. We observed that
the frequency content of the sagittal and coronal modes
were fairly similar, whereas axial rotation excited a larger
frequency regime (up to 60 Hz).
We further discovered that 75% of the total brain dis-
placement energy can be captured by combining tempo-
ral modes with frequencies up to 33Hz, which indicates
the shear waves at higher frequencies are less significant
for the brain dynamics (Figure 2B). This could be an im-
portant consideration for developing reduced-order mod-
els that are capable of simulating brain’s response and
achieving close to real-time analysis. The effect of this
low frequency behavior is directly reflected in the tissue-
level strains as well. To separate the effect of input ampli-
tude from modal behavior, we normalized the principal
strains with respect to peak rotational acceleration, as
there is an almost linear relationship between the two
(See Supplementary Figure S2). As we show in Figure
2C, the mean and standard error of peak principal strains
normalized with respect to peak rotational acceleration
exhibit amplifying behavior in the 20-40 Hz frequency
regime, following a similar trend to the modal ampli-
tudes. These results confirmed our previous assessment
concerning the importance of the low frequency brain de-
formation [35].
So far, we have only examined the dominant mode, i.e.
the mode with the highest amplitude, in each simulation;
however, brain dynamics is influenced by the interaction
of multiple modes that might have substantial contribu-
tion to tissue deformation.
To quantify the extent of
this contribution, we investigated how the peak principal
strains calculated from the FE model compare against
the predictions of the second-order mass-spring system
proposed by Kornhauser [47]. The spring-mass system
was used to approximate the contribution of the domi-
nant mode to the relative brain displacement. We used
the largest directional component of rotational acceler-
ation as base excitation. We used previously published
values for moment of inertia [48], and based on the re-
sults shown in Figure 2A, we assumed a 28Hz natural
frequency.

FIG. 3.
Dynamic ranges of brain modes indicate multi-
modal behavior for higher input amplitudes: (A) Football
data from Stanford mouthguard and NFL data from [49] are com-
pared against the best linear fit calculated by using the global
dominant mode (Figure 4A). Multi-modal behavior is observed for
higher strain values, where a single mode fails to predict the peak
principal strain. Dynamic range of football cases reveal a transi-
tion towards a multi-modal behavior at higher strain values, (B)
The dynamic ranges of individual football simulations significantly
increases as they are further away from the single mode prediction.
The rationale here was that if the global mode is the
main contributing factor to brain strain, we would expect
the relation between the maximum relative displacement
from the lumped model to correlate almost linearly with
the peak principal strains from the FE model. The re-
sults are shown in Figure 3A, where the dashed line rep-
resents the best linear fit (R2 = 0.72) between peak prin-
cipal strain and maximum displacement from the lumped
model. As expected, for low brain strains (< 15%), this
relationship maintains its linearity. As the brain strains
become larger, the linear correlation decreases and more
outliers start to emerge, which we attribute to stronger
multi-modal behavior in brain regions. Due to the lim-
ited number of high strain cases, we superimposed strain
and displacement predictions for 58 (25 injury cases) pre-
viously reported National Football League (NFL) head
impact cases (represented by gray crosses) [49]. To for-
mally investigate this effect, we used the parameter dy-
namic range, which we defined as the span of frequencies
that exist within 50% of the dominant mode’s ampli-
tude. The dynamic range increases from zero to 25Hz
as we go towards higher strain levels. By grouping the
strain values so that they fall within 10Hz dynamic range
bins, we see an increase in the average error for higher
strains. As shown in Figure 3B, the correlation between
the 1D model and the FE model’s predictions decreases
with increasing dynamic range, indicating richer dynam-
ical behavior (p < 0.01).
The multi-modal behavior of the brain presented here
provides interesting insights into possible mechanistic
causes of sports-related concussion.
Almost all of the
injury cases we examined fell within the highest dynamic
range when compared with other football cases, signaling
a strongly multi-modal behavior. It is not surprising to
see that most of this multi-modal behavior falls into the
higher strain regions since higher skull kinematics lead to
higher tissue deformations, intensify the effects of nonlin-
ear material behavior and geometric nonlinearities, and
enrich the resultant dynamics in the frequency domain.
The richer temporal dynamics caused by the multi-
modal behavior has the potential to create more spa-
tiotemporal differences within the brain structures, hence
resulting in localized dynamical phenomena and exac-
erbating the regional relative displacements.
The TBI
community has long regarded the periventricular area
of the brain to be a specifically vulnerable region dur-
ing rapid head motions [50] and tissue deformation in
this area has been proposed as a potential cause for con-
cussion [22, 51]. To explore this further, we examined
the spatial variation of the dominant mode frequency
within the brain for 7 different brain structures span-
ning deep and cortical regions of the brain: corpus cal-
losum (CC), gray matter (GM), brain stem (BS), mid
brain (MB), white matter (WM), thalamus (TH), and
cerebellum (CB) (Figure 4A). We compared the modal
behavior for each region, between the LOC case and the
average case, where we took the mean and standard de-
viation of all the 187 non-injury cases in both frequency
and normalized strain measures (represented by horizon-
tal and vertical error bars in Figure 4B). Superimposing
the regional frequencies and normalized peak principal
strains onto the global trends (repeated from Figure 2C),
we found that corpus callosum has a distinct modal fre-
quency around 25 Hz and the corresponding contribution
of this mode creates the highest strain levels in the brain,
when compared with other regions. The local mode in
CC for LOC has even a higher contribution to the tissue-
level strains, resulting in 20% higher normalized strains
than the brain’s average at 25 Hz. Other brain regions
have distinct modal frequencies as well, with brainstem
having the highest modal frequency around 40 Hz. We
did not observe clear differences in the variance of local
decays rates between the two cases (See Supplementary
Figure S6). The LOC case, which has a high dynamic
range, leads to distinct local frequencies, specifically in
the periventricular region. In contrast, the average case
with a low dynamic range, expresses a smooth distribu-
tion of local frequencies. The increased localization in
CC for the LOC case compared with the average case is
noteworthy, especially since this region was identified as
a good correlate for concussion classification in our pre-
vious study [22] (Figure 4B-D). These results suggest a
potential link between mode localization and tissue dam-
age.
A complete investigation of the effect of multi-modal
behavior on regional brain dynamics requires a more ex-
tensive study; however, a closer examination of the LOC
head impact case against the average modal behavior

supports our injury hypothesis above: localized dynamics
caused by the multi-modal behavior of the brain tends to
excite more dangerous dynamics in the deep brain struc-
tures.
From a mechanistic point of view, understanding the
initiation of these localized modes requires taking into
account the nonlinear material properties and geometry
of the skull-brain system. Even in the absence of skull
deformation, external forces on the head will translate
to the brain tissue. Given the compliance of the skull-
brain interface [52, 53] and the viscoelastic and nonlin-
ear behavior of the brain tissue [54], this energy trans-
lation will lead to the initiation of shear and longitu-
dinal waves inside the brain. Motion and deformation
of brain under external loading, which is governed by
damped hyperbolic equations, will have nonlinear shear
and longitudinal components [55–57]. The Zabolotskaya
equation describes the propagation of finite-amplitude,
two-dimensional, linearly-polarized, shear waves in non-
linear solids [58]. Let U(x, y, t) depict the 2D displace-
ment field in a nonlinear media and x be the direction
of shear wave propagation. The shear wave propagation
can then be represented as follows [59]:
(Ut + βU 2Ux)x + 1
2Uyy = 0
(3)
where β is a parameter that characterizes the material
properties of the solid.
The cubic nonlinear term en-
countered in the above equation is known to generate
localized nonlinear modes in structural systems with ge-
ometric nonlinearities [60, 61], systems with nonlinear
absorbers or energy sinks [62], and granular dimer chains
[63, 64].
Localization and motion confinement are ob-
served when vibrational energy tends to be confined to
one particular area of a structure or continuous media.
They have first been observed for periodic linear struc-
tures presenting a structural irregularity [65]. A generic
property of nonlinear mode localization is high localized
amplitudes in a particular area of the media with a dis-
tinct oscillation frequency.
In this study, through the
use of dynamic mode decomposition, we have found ev-
idence regarding the existence of such modes as well as
strain localization in the brain, particularly in the deep
white matter brain regions. To the best of our knowl-
edge, there has been no experimental evidence regard-
ing the existence of such modes in nonlinear viscoelastic
media up to date. By combining experimental measure-
ments with computational modeling, our study presents
the first indirect empirical evidence regarding the exis-
tence of localized modes with varying eigenvalues in a
nonlinear, viscoelastic and inhomogeneous media.
In summary, we used the FE model to simulate 187
head impacts collected during football game and practice.
This provided over 40,000 snapshots of over 5,000 nodal
brain displacements. We utilized DMD analysis to ex-
tract modal behavior of brain from these highly transient
events.
Our findings show that (i) brain-skull system
is dominated by low frequency dynamics and more than
75% of brain’s displacement can be captured by temporal
modes with frequencies under 33 Hz, (ii) strain in brain
tissue is amplified in frequencies close to 30Hz, (iii) high
dynamic range and multi-modal behavior might be asso-
ciated with higher risks of injury, and (iv) periventricular
regions of the brain are prone to mode localization, which
is the first such evidence for this type of phenomenon in
a nonlinear hyper-viscoelastic medium.
There are several limitations associated with the work
presented here. The FE model used in this study had
previously been partially validated with sparse cadaver
experiments and not thoroughly validated against in vivo
MRI data [25, 66]. We believe that more accurate and
region specific material properties and more detailed ge-
ometries, particularly the cortical gyri, will render the
dynamic differences more pronounced. The constitutive
 6
material models used in the FE simulations incorporate
a linear viscosity definition, which might explain why the
local decay rates in LOC and average cases were similar
(See Supplementary Figure S6). In addition, the loading
space used in this study is limited to head impacts in
football. Although similar results might be expected in
higher loading regimes, such as car accidents, the loading
bias in different anatomical regions might have a signifi-
cant effect on the resulting brain dynamics. Also, we had
relatively low number of axial rotation cases from our
football data compared to coronal and sagittal, which
might render the frequency regimes of the axial modes
(Figure 2A) less accurate.
Finally, there are small er-
rors in the mouthguard measurements, previously quan-
tified in anthropomorphic test dummy and in vivo video-
tracking experiments [67, 68].
The spatiotemporal characteristics of the human brain
we identified in this Letter are particularly interesting
because strain in corpus callosum has previously been
shown to be the best predictor for concussion cases in
football [17, 22]. Similar observations have been made
in previous diffusion tensor imaging studies to detect
brain abnormalities in patients with concussions. Fiber
tracts in the deep brain structures such as corpus callo-
sum, fornix, hippocampus, thalamus and cingulum bun-
dles have been shown to be the most common locations
of abnormal fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity
[69]. There needs to be more clinical observations to cor-
roborate with the findings of this study.
With the advancing imaging technology in acquir-
ing more spatially and temporally resolved experimen-
tal data, and more detailed finite element models, it is
conceivable that ever larger datasets will become avail-
able in the future. As such, our proposed methodology
is particularly helpful in extracting most notable charac-
teristics of brain dynamics. A natural next step would be
to use this technique in developing reduced-order models
of brain deformation that could be used to perform near
real-time simulations of head impacts, providing crucial
information to clinicians for informed return-to-play de-
cisions.
