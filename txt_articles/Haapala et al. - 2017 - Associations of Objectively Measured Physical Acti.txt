Abstract
Purpose—To investigate the relationships of objectively measured physical activity (PA) and 
sedentary time (ST) to arterial stiffness in pre-pubertal children.
Method—Altogether 136 children (57 boys, 79 girls) aged 6–8-years participated in the study. 
Stiffness index (SI) was assessed by pulse contour analysis based on photoplethysmography. ST, 
light PA, moderate PA, and vigorous PA were assessed using combined acceleration and heart rate 
monitoring. We investigated the associations of ST (<1.5METs) and time spent in intensity level 
of PA above 2–7METs in min/d with SI using linear regression analysis. We studied the optimal 
duration and intensity of PA to identify children being in the highest quarter of SI using Receiver 
Operating Characteristics curves.
Results—Moderate PA, vigorous PA, and cumulative time spent in PA above 3 (β=–0.279, 
P=0.002), 4 (β=–0.341, P<0.001), 5 (β=–0.349, P<0.001), 6 (β=–0.312, P<0.001), and 7 (β=–
0.254, P=0.005) METs were inversely associated with SI after adjustment for age, sex, and 
monitor wear time. The cutoffs for identifying children being in the highest quarter of SI <68 
min/d for PA exceeding 5 METs and <26 min/d for PA exceeding 6 METs.
Conclusion—Lower levels of PA exceeding 3–6 METs were related to higher arterial stiffness in 
children.

 Introduction
The process leading to arteriosclerosis begins early in life (28, 52) and autopsy studies have 
documented that fatty streaks in the arterial wall exist already in young children (7) 
suggesting that the prevention of cardiovascular diseases should begin as early as possible. 
Increased arterial stiffness is one of the first signs of arteriosclerosis in children (18). 
Arterial stiffness refers to decreased compliance and distensibility of arteries in response to 
pressure changes (5, 57). Arterial stiffness develops through age-associated fractures in 
elastin caused by repeated cyclic stress and complicated cellular and molecular factors such 
as systemic inflammation and free radicals leading to smooth muscle media calcification, 
changes in cell signaling, and endothelial dysfunction (5, 57). Arterial stiffness has been 
associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in adults (33, 53). Exercise 
training has been shown to improve artery compliance in middle-aged and older adults (4). 
However, evidence on the associations of physical activity (PA) with arterial stiffness, 
structure, and function in pre-pubertal children is limited (12, 18).
PA may improve arterial stiffness by reducing adiposity and other traditional 
cardiometabolic risk factors, systemic low-grade inflammation, sympathetic drive, and 
oxidative stress and by increasing nitric oxide bioavailability and improving endothelial 
vasodilatation (19). The evidence on the mechanisms explaining possible adverse effects of 
sedentary time (ST) on arterial stiffness is limited, but may include increased arterial 
vasoconstriction and cardiometabolic risk factors related to higher ST (24, 45, 48, 54).
Lower levels of self-reported PA have been related to higher artery stiffness and aortic 
intima-media thickness (IMT) in children and adolescents (31, 32, 42). Lower levels of PA 
during childhood have also been found to predict higher artery stiffness in adulthood (35). 
Nevertheless, the results of some studies suggest that there is no relationship between PA 
and arterial stiffness among children (36, 55). The main limitation of most of the previous 
studies is that they have used measures based on self-reported PA that are prone to recall 
bias and have limited ability to correctly identify the level and intensity of PA (14, 16). 
Furthermore, most previous investigations have been cross-sectional in design and the few 
longitudinal studies have included overweight or obese children (12).
Studies using objective methods to assess PA have observed either inverse (30, 37) or no 
association (38, 41) between PA and arterial stiffness in children and adolescents. There is 
also some evidence that higher levels of objectively measured PA are related to improved 
flow-mediated dilation, a measure of arterial endothelial function, in children and 
adolescents (1, 23). Although PA of higher intensity may have a stronger association with 
arterial stiffness than lower intensity PA among children (23), there are no studies on 
objectively measured and individually calibrated PA intensities in relation to arterial stiffness 
in mid-childhood. Previous studies have found no association between self-reported or 
objectively measured ST and arterial stiffness or IMT in children (29, 47). However, higher 
levels of ST have been linked to increased arterial stiffness in young adults aged 30 years 
(24).

 Exercise training at higher intensity has been found to improve arterial stiffness more than 
exercise training at lower intensity (4). However, the evidence of the associations of PA at 
different intensities and ST with arterial stiffness in children is limited (12, 18). The aim of 
the present study was to investigate the relationships of objectively measured ST and PA at 
different intensities to arterial stiffness in pre-pubertal children.
Methods
Study design and study population
Data for the present analyses were obtained from the Physical Activity and Nutrition in 
Children (PANIC) Study (50). The PANIC Study is an ongoing controlled physical activity 
and dietary intervention study in a population sample of primary-school children from the 
city of Kuopio. In total, 736 children 6–8 years of age who were in Grade 1 in 2007–2009 
were invited to participate, and 512 (70%) participated. At baseline, arterial stiffness was 
assessed in a subsample of 230 children and complete data on variables used in the present 
analyses were available for 136 children (57 boys, 79 girls). Children who were included in 
the study sample were more likely to be girls (P=0.007), had higher levels of moderate PA 
(P<0.001), and had better cardiorespiratory fitness (P=0.003) than children who were 
excluded. The included children did not differ in any other characteristic from the excluded 
children. The PANIC Study protocol was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the 
Hospital District of Northern Savo, Kuopio, Finland. All participating children and their 
parents provided written informed consent.
Assessment of physical activity and sedentary time
PA and ST were assessed using a combined heart rate and movement monitor (Actiheart®, 
CamNtech Ltd., Papworth, UK) (9) worn continuously for a minimum of four consecutive 
days without interruption. The monitor was attached to the chest with two standard 
electrocardiogram electrodes (Bio Protech Inc, South Korea) and recorded data in 60-second 
epochs. Upon retrieving the monitoring device, heart rate data were cleaned (43), 
individually calibrated with parameters from the exercise test (27), and combined with trunk 
acceleration (10) using branched equation modeling to produce intensity time-series (8). 
Whilst minimizing diurnal bias caused by any potential non-wear episodes (11), PA energy 
expenditure (PAEE) was calculated by the integration of the intensity time-series, and the 
time distribution of activity intensity was generated by using standard metabolic equivalents 
(METs). For these analyses, the equivalent of 3.5ml O2/min/kg (71 J/min/kg) was used to 
define one MET and data summarized as ST (<1.5 METs), light PA (1.5-4 METs), moderate 
PA (4-7 METs), and vigorous PA (>7 METs). Awake-time ST was calculated by subtracting 
sleep time from total time <1.5METs. PA records were included in the analysis if they 
contained ≥48h of total wear data, distributed as ≥32h during weekdays and ≥16h during 
weekend days, and ≥12h of morning, noon, afternoon, and evening wear data. These time-
distribution criteria shielded against potential bias from the over-representation of specific 
parts of days, and optimized the diurnal bias minimization procedure.

 Assessment of arterial stiffness
Stiffness index (SI) was assessed by pulse contour analysis (PCA) based on noninvasive 
photoplethysmography using the PulseTrace PCA2® device (Micro Medical, Gillingham, 
Kent, UK), as described in more detail previously (48, 49). SI was assessed in a supine 
position prior to the exercise test in a test laboratory at stable room temperature (20–22 °C) 
after a 15-minute rest. SI was calculated by dividing body height by time between the first 
(systolic) peak and the second (diastolic) peak of the pulse contour and was expressed in 
meters per second. All pulse contours were visually examined afterwards to control for 
quality. Data were excluded from analysis if there was an extra peak between the systolic 
and diastolic peak that was incorrectly defined as the diastolic peak; if the PCA indexes were 
incorrectly measured by the device; or if the pulse contours of the same child markedly 
differed visually (48). A higher SI indicates stiffer (less compliant) arteries. The within-
subject coefficient of variation is 7.4% for SI and the intraclass-correlation=0.44 (95% 
Confidence Interval (CI)=0.13 to 0.67) (49).
Assessment of body composition and size
Body fat mass, body fat percentage, and lean body mass were measured by the Lunar 
Prodigy Advance® dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry device (GE Medical Systems, 
Madison, WI, USA) using standardized protocols (46). Body weight was measured twice to 
accuracy of 0.1kg after overnight fasting with empty bladder, and whilst standing in light 
underwear using the InBody® 720 bioelectrical impedance device (Biospace, Seoul, Korea). 
The mean of the two values was used for analyses. Body height was measured three times to 
accuracy of 0.1cm using a wall-mounted stadiometer whilst barefoot and with the head 
positioned in the Frankfurt plane. The mean of the nearest two values was used for analyses. 
Waist circumference was measured three times after expiration at mid distance between the 
bottom of the rib cage and the top of the iliac crest with an unstretchable measuring tape to 
an accuracy of 0.1cm. Body mass index - standard deviation score was calculated using 
Finnish references (40), and the prevalence of overweight and obesity was defined using cut-
offs published by Cole and co-workers (13).
Other assessments
Cardiorespiratory fitness was assessed by a maximal exercise test with an 
electromagnetically-braked Ergoselect 200K® cycle ergometer (Ergoline, Bitz, Germany) 
(26). Cardiorespiratory fitness was defined as maximal workload attained during the exercise 
test and expressed per kilograms of lean body mass. Blood pressure was measured manually 
in a sitting position from the right arm using a calibrated Heine 130 Gamma G7® aneroid 
sphygmomanometer (Heine, Munich, Germany). Blood pressure was also assessed in a 
supine position before the exercise test to obtain blood pressure values in a standardized 
hemodynamic state for the analyses (48). Venous blood samples for the measurement of 
fasting serum insulin, leptin, and 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) and fasting plasma 
glucose, triglycerides, and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol were taken after 12-h 
overnight fasting (51). We calculated a cardiometabolic risk score using population-specific 
z-scores as waist circumference + fasting serum insulin concentration + fasting plasma 
glucose concentration + fasting plasma triglyceride concentration – fasting plasma HDL

 cholesterol concentration + mean of systolic and diastolic blood pressure with a higher score 
indicating higher cardiometabolic risk (51). The number of meals and snacks per day, food 
consumption, total energy intake, nutrient intakes as percentages of total energy intake, and 
sodium intake were assessed using food records on four consecutive days including two 
weekdays and two weekend days (17). A clinical nutritionist instructed the parents how to 
fill in the food record. A clinical nutritionist also reviewed the food records at return. Data 
on birth weight were acquired from the records of Kuopio University Hospital, Kuopio, 
Finland. A research physician assessed pubertal status using the five-stage scale described 
by Tanner (44).
Statistical methods
Basic characteristics between boys and girls were compared using the Student´s t-test, the 
Mann-Whitney U-test, or the Chi Square-test. The associations of ST and PA as independent 
variables with SI as the dependent variable were studied using linear regression analysis. 
First, ST, light PA, moderate PA, or vigorous PA were entered into the linear regression 
model one by one and the data were adjusted for age, sex, and monitor wear time. The 
associations were then mutually adjusted for ST, light PA, moderate PA, and vigorous PA to 
investigate the independent associations of these measures with SI. We also investigated the 
associations of the cumulative time (min/d) spent above one MET, two METs, three METs, 
four METs, five METs, six METs, and seven METs with SI using sequential linear 
regression analyses. We studied combined associations of PA and ST with SI using general 
linear models adjusted for age, sex, and monitor wear time. We dichotomized PA using cut-
offs determined in the ROC curve analyses and ST was dichotomized at the median. All data 
were additionally adjusted for cardiorespiratory fitness, body fat percentage, systolic blood 
pressure, the cardiometabolic risk score, serum leptin, serum 25(OH)D, saturated fat, 
sucrose, sodium intake, eating all three main meals daily, or birth weight.
Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves were used to investigate the optimal cutoff 
for the duration and intensity of PA to identify children being in the highest quarter of SI. 
The area under the curve (AUC) is considered a measure of the utility of the predictor 
variable and represents the trade-off between the correct identification of children in the 
highest quarter of SI (sensitivity) and the correct identification of other children (specificity). 
An AUC of 1 represents the ability to perfectly identify children in the highest quarter of SI 
from other children, whereas an AUC of 0.5 indicates no greater predictive ability than 
chance alone. We determined the optimal cutoff using the Youden index (34), which is the 
maximum value of J that is computed as sensitivity + specificity – 1.
We performed statistical analyses using the SPSS Statistics, Version 21.0 (IBM Corp., 
Armonk, NY, USA), except that the ROC curve analyses were performed using MedCalc 
Statistical Software, Version 16.1 (MedCalc Software bvba, Ostend, Belgium).

 Results
Characteristics
All 136 children were pre-pubertal. Boys were slightly older and taller and had a lower body 
fat percentage and a better cardiorespiratory fitness than girls (Table 1). Boys also 
accumulated more moderate PA and vigorous PA and had a higher PAEE than girls.
Associations of light, moderate, and vigorous physical activity and sedentary time with 
arterial stiffness
Higher levels of moderate PA and vigorous PA were associated with lower SI after 
adjustment for age, sex, and monitor wear time (Table 2). Mutual adjustment for ST, light 
PA, moderate PA, or vigorous PA had no effect on these associations. Further adjustment for 
cardiorespiratory fitness, body fat percentage, systolic blood pressure, the cardiometabolic 
risk score, serum leptin, serum 25(OH)D, saturated fat, sucrose, sodium intake, eating all 
three main meals daily, or birth weight had no effect on these associations (data not shown). 
ST or light PA were not associated with SI.
Associations of cumulative times spent in physical activity above different intensities with 
arterial stiffness
Higher cumulative time spent in PA above three METs (β=–0.279, 95% confidence interval 
(CI)=-0.453 to -0.106, P=0.002), four METs (β=–0.341, 95% CI=-0.515 to -0.167, 
P<0.001), five METs (β=–0.349, 95% CI=-0.524 to -0.174, P<0.001), six METs (β=–0.312, 
95% CI=-0.220 to -0.064, P<0.001), and seven METs (β=–0.254, 95% CI=-0.428 to -0.080, 
P=0.005) were associated with lower SI after adjustment for age, sex, and monitor wear 
time. Further adjustments had no effect on these relationships (data not shown).
The ROC curve analyses revealed that the optimal cutoff for time spent in PA above five 
METs to identify children being in the highest quarter of SI was <68 min/d (95% CI = 63 to 
105) with a sensitivity of 79%, a specificity of 49%, an AUC of 0.609 (95% CI = 0.522 to 
0.691, P=0.047), and the Youden index of 0.2843. The optimal cutoff for time spent PA 
above six METs was <26 min/d (95% CI 23 to 60) with a sensitivity of 71%, a specificity of 
64%, an AUC of 0.625 (95% CI 0.538 to 0.707, P=0.027), and the Youden index of 0.3431. 
There were no other statistically significant associations of ST or PA with SI in the ROC 
curve analyses.
Age, sex, or monitor wear time were not related to SI. Of the other variables in the model, a 
lower cardiorespiratory fitness (β=-0.250, 95% CI=-0.437 to -0.064, P=0.009) and higher 
systolic blood pressure (β=0.235, 95% CI=0.064 to 0.406, P=0.008) were associated with a 
higher SI after controlling for age, sex, and monitor wear time. The association between 
systolic blood pressure and SI remained significant when PA was in the same model 
(P<0.05), but the association with cardiorespiratory fitness was no longer statistically 
significant when PA exceeding intensity of four METs was included in the model (P>0.05). 
Cardiorespiratory fitness remained statistically significantly related to SI when the data were 
adjusted for time spent at PA exceeding three METs (P<0.05).

 Combined associations of physical activity and sedentary time with stiffness index
Children with lower levels of ST and higher levels of PA above 5 METs had a lower SI than 
children with lower levels of both ST and PA above 5 METs (mean difference -0.383, 95% 
CI for difference=-0.511 to -0.128, P<0.001) (Figure 1). Those with lower levels of ST and 
higher levels of PA above 5 METs also had a lower SI than children with higher levels of ST 
along with lower levels of PA above 5 METs (mean difference -0.320, 95% CI for 
difference=-0.612 to -0.155, P<0.001). Further adjustment had no effect on these differences 
(data not shown).
Children with lower levels of ST and higher levels of PA above 6 METs had a lower SI than 
children with lower levels of ST accompanied by lower levels of PA above 6 METs (mean 
difference -0.292, 95% CI for difference=-0.558 to -0.026, P=0.024) and children with 
higher levels of ST along with lower levels of PA above 6 METs (mean difference -0.295, 
95% CI for difference=-0.481 to -0.109, P<0.001) (Figure 1).
Children with a combination of higher levels of ST and higher levels of PA above 6 METs 
had a lower SI than children with lower levels of both ST and PA above 6 METs (mean 
difference -0.325, 95% CI for difference=-0.633 to -0.018, P<0.001) (Figure 1). They also 
had a lower SI than children with higher levels of ST and lower levels of PA above 6 METs 
(mean difference -0.329, 95% CI for difference=-0.568 to -0.089, P=0.002). Further 
adjustment had no effect on these differences.
Discussion
We found that lower levels of objectively measured PA exceeding the intensity of three 
METs were associated with a higher SI in pre-pubertal children after adjustment for 
confounding factors. Lower levels of PA exceeding the intensity of 4–6 METs had the 
strongest associations with SI. The optimal thresholds for PA above five and six METs to 
identify children being in the highest quarter of SI were less than 68 and 26 min/d, 
respectively. These results dealing with arterial stiffness agree relatively well with the 
recommendation that children should have at least 60 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous PA 
daily (56).
The findings of a previous study suggest that adolescents doing more than 67 minutes of 
moderate-to-vigorous PA per day have more compliant carotid arteries than adolescents 
doing less than 17 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous PA per day (37). Furthermore, higher 
levels of light PA and moderate-to-vigorous PA have been linked to lower stiffness of small, 
but not large, arteries (30). Some other studies have found no association between 
objectively measured PA and arterial stiffness among children and adolescents (38, 41). We 
observed that lower levels of PA were associated with a higher SI and that PA above 4–6 
METs had the strongest relationship with SI among pre-pubertal children. These findings 
suggest that PA intensity may be an important determinant of arterial stiffness in children. 
One reason for the weaker association between PA and arterial stiffness among children in 
some other studies (41) than in our study may be that the number of steps taken daily, which 
is unable to capture the intensity distribution of PA, has been used as a measure of PA. Other

 plausible explanations for the partly inconsistent findings include differences in the 
measures of arterial stiffness used and the segments of the arteries studied in earlier studies.
We found that PAs exceeding the intensity of 5–6 METs were optimal to differentiate 
children in the highest quarter of SI with the optimal cutoff of <68 minutes for PA exceeding 
5 METs and <26 minutes for PA exceeding 6 METs. These findings are supported by the 
observation from the European Young Heart Study that adolescent boys exceeding 67 
minutes of moderate-to-vigorous PA daily had more compliant arteries than those with less 
than 17 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous PA daily (37).Furthermore, the results of some 
studies have suggested that 30–75 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous PA for at least three 
times a week improve endothelial function in overweight or obese children and adolescents 
(15). These findings together suggest that achieving a minimum of 60 minutes of moderate-
to-vigorous PA is linked to reduced arterial stiffness already in childhood.
The reasons for the inverse association between moderate-to-vigorous PA and SI could be 
simplified to increased arterial remodeling and compliance due to repeated shear stress in 
response to PA (22). Increased shear stress has been found to activate various signaling 
pathways leading to increased bioavailability of nitric oxide and thereby improved arterial 
compliance (19). However, the mechanisms for the inverse relationship between PA and 
arterial stiffness are likely complex and are associated with various beneficial effects of 
increased PA such as decreased adiposity, blood pressure, oxidative stress, and systemic 
inflammation and improved insulin sensitivity and lipid metabolism (20).
We observed that the association between time spent in PA above 7 METs and SI were 
weaker than the associations of time spent in PA above 4, 5, and 6 METs. An explanation for 
this observation may be that children had relatively low levels of vigorous PA which reduced 
variance and statistical power. Another explanation is that very strenuous PA may impair 
nitric oxide bioavailability and increase oxidative stress which may increase arterial stiffness 
(21).
We found no relationship of ST or light PA to SI among children. Although sedentary 
behavior has been directly associated with cardiometabolic risk in children even independent 
of PA (2, 54), it has not been related to carotid artery IMT, arterial stiffness, or brachial 
artery flow-mediated dilation, in other studies among children (23, 29, 47) or in adults (45). 
We also showed that lower levels of PA were related to a higher SI among children 
regardless of ST. These observations suggest that sedentary behavior is not strongly 
associated with arterial structure or function during childhood. A reason for these weak 
associations between ST and arterial stiffness in children may be that children are highly 
adaptive and can compensate the negative effects of increased ST on arterial stiffness. 
Children in our study also had relatively low levels of ST which may weaken the 
associations of ST with SI. Arteriosclerosis is a progressive but slow process and is partly 
due to a long-term exposure to a sedentary lifestyle. Furthermore, one explanation on the 
null association between light PA and SI may be due to insufficient shear stress and nitric 
oxide synthesis in response to light PA (3, 4). Therefore, longitudinal studies from childhood 
to adolescence and young adulthood are needed to investigate whether higher levels of ST 
Haapala et al.

 and low levels of light PA are independently associated with increased arterial stiffness in 
the long term.
The strengths of the present study are the objective measures of PA and ST and the 
possibility to adjust the data for a number of confounding factors. The main limitation of the 
study is that we were unable to use the gold-standard measures of arterial stiffness, such as 
pulse wave velocity between the carotid and femoral arteries. In ROC-curve analyses, we 
defined children having increased arterial stiffness as those being in the highest quarter of 
SI. Our study sample included mainly healthy children for whom there is no widely accepted 
threshold for a clinically meaningful increase in SI. However, a previous study reported a 
strong association between SI and pulse wave velocity in adults suggesting that SI is a good 
surrogate measure for pulse wave velocity (39). There are no data on the tracking of arterial 
stiffness from childhood to adulthood and whether it predicts cardiovascular diseases in 
adulthood. Nevertheless, arterial stiffness has been found to be a strong independent 
predictor of cardiovascular diseases and premature mortality in adults (53) and increased 
cardiometabolic risk in childhood has been related to increased arterial stiffness in adulthood 
(25).
Another limitation of the study is that the relatively small sample size decreased power to 
detect statistically significant associations. Therefore, the cutoffs observed in the ROC curve 
analyses should be interpreted cautiously and treated as interim thresholds for PA needed to 
decrease arterial stiffness. These cutoffs should be confirmed in larger population based 
samples of children. We had to exclude a relatively high number of children because of 
insufficient PA monitor wear time and errors in the pulse contour analyses. Children 
included in the present study population also had higher levels of moderate PA and 
cardiorespiratory fitness than the excluded children. It is therefore possible that the 
association between PA and arterial stiffness would have been even stronger if the study 
sample had included more children with lower levels of PA and cardiorespiratory fitness that 
would have increased variation in these measures. A small sample size and the exclusion of 
children with higher levels of PA and cardiorespiratory fitness also decreases 
generalizability of the results.
Furthermore, we did not assess diet quality or fluid balance before the assessment of arterial 
stiffness, although both of them could have an effect on the assessment. We used only 
objectively measured ST in our study although some specific types of sedentary behavior 
may have a stronger association with arterial stiffness than others. However, we have 
previously found no association between screen-based sedentary behavior and SI in children 
(47). We also set the combined heart rate and movement monitor to record data at 60-second 
resolution. This may have some minor effects on the results as typically, children’s activity 
includes short vigorous activity periods followed by ST or light PA (6). Finally, the cross-
sectional study design does not allow us to draw a conclusion on the causality of the 
relationship between PA and arterial stiffness and their implications for the prevention of 
cardiovascular disease later in life. Therefore, longitudinal studies are needed to investigate 
whether certain levels of PA in childhood are associated with increased arterial stiffness in 
adulthood and whether they predict the risk of cardiovascular disease in adulthood (18).

 In conclusion, we found that lower levels of PA exceeding the intensity of 4–6 METs had the 
strongest association with higher artery stiffness in children. We also observed that 
accumulating at least 68 minutes of PA exceeding the intensity of five METs and 26 minutes 
of PA exceeding six METs per day were optimal to reduce the risk of having increased 
arterial stiffness among children. Furthermore, our findings suggested that higher levels of 
physical activity were related to lower SI regardless of sedentary time. These findings 
emphasize the role of at least moderate-intensity PA in maintaining normal arterial function 
since childhood.
