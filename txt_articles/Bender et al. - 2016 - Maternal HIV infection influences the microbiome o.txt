More than 1 million HIV-exposed, uninfected infants are born annually to HIV-positive mothers worldwide. This growing
population of infants experiences twice the mortality of HIV-unexposed infants. We found that although there were very
few differences seen in the microbiomes of mothers with and without HIV infection, maternal HIV infection was asso-
ciated with changes in the microbiome of HIV-exposed, uninfected infants. Furthermore, we observed that human
breast milk oligosaccharides were associated with bacterial species in the infant microbiome. The disruption of the
infant’s microbiome associated with maternal HIV infection may contribute to the increased morbidity and mortality
of HIV-exposed, uninfected infants.
INTRODUCTION
More than 1 million HIV-exposed, uninfected infants are born annually
toHIV-positivemothersworldwide(1).Thisgrowingpopulationofinfants
experience higher morbidity and twice the mortality of HIV-unexposed,
uninfected infants in the same community (2–9). Furthermore, many of
theseHIV-exposed,uninfectedinfantsgoontoexperienceimmunological
derangements that may persist into adolescence (10). With the growing
number of young women infected with HIV worldwide and the persist-
entlyhighHIVseroprevalenceamongchildbearingwomeninsub-Saharan
Africa, HIV-exposed, uninfected infants are rapidly becoming another sig-
nificant medical casualty in the HIV pandemic.
It remains unclear why HIV-exposed, uninfected infants experience
higher morbidity and mortality compared to matched HIV-unexposed,
uninfected infant controls. The establishment of a normal microbiome in
infants greatly influences the development of a healthy infant metabolism
andimmunity(11).Manystudieshavenowshownthattheinfantacquires
muchof itsmicrobiome from the motherandcontinuesto be conditioned
withcommensalbacteriafoundin breast milk(12, 13). Studieshave further
shown that HIV-infected adults experience dysbiosis in their microbiome
(14–17). Because HIV preferentially targets CD4+ T cells within the gut
lamina propria (18), the immune system is less well equipped to interact
with the microbes that make up the intestinalmicrobiome. Culture-based
methods looking at the microbiome of mother and infant pairs have
shown some associations with HIV infection (19), but how this dysbiosis
isestablishedintheHIV-exposed,uninfectedinfantispoorlyunderstood.
Breastfeeding conveys health benefits in both HIV-infected and HIV-
exposed, uninfected infants (20–24). For this reason, breastfeeding in
combination with maternal antiretroviral therapy is the recommended
form of feeding for HIV-infected women in resource-limited settings
(25). Milk is a complex fluid providing not only nutrition to the infant
but also many immune-active components. How these contribute to in-
fanthealthremainspoorlydefined.Humanmilkoligosaccharides(HMOs)
are the third largest constituent of human milk, but they are not digested
by humans (26). HMOs are multifunctional, but their major purpose
appearsto be asa prebiotic,providing nutrition to the infantmicrobiome
(26). This in turn conditions the developing immune system (27, 28). We
havepreviouslyshownthatchangesinHMOcompositioninfluencepost-
natal transmission and survival of HIV-exposed, uninfected infants (20).
We hypothesized that perturbation of both the mother’s microbiome and
the mother’s breast milk HMO composition by HIV infection alters the
microbiome in HIV-exposed, uninfected infants and may account for
some of the immunological and survival differences seen in HIV-exposed,
uninfected infants compared to HIV-unexposed, uninfected infants.
RESULTS
Characteristics of mother-infant pairs were similar
regardless of mother’s HIV status
Weenrolled50motherandinfantpairsfromPort-au-Prince,Haiti,even-
ly split between HIV-positive and HIV-negative mothers (Table 1). HIV-
positive mothers had more antibiotic exposure during pregnancy and
during the postpartum period (P = 0.02) and higher body mass in-
dices (BMIs) compared to HIV-negative mothers (P = 0.023), but other-
wise, the groups were generally comparable. All HIV-positive mothers
were on antiretroviral therapy at the time of presentation and throughout
their pregnancy. These mothers had low levels of plasma HIV RNA (68%
undetectable) and had correspondingly high CD4 T cell counts [median,
567 cells/mm3; interquartile range (IQR), 369 to 681], suggesting pre-
served immune function (Table 2). All infants were breastfed (Table 3).
None of the mothers were on antibiotics at the time of the study, andnone
of the infants received antibiotics at any point, including trimethoprim-
sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis. Samples from six different body sites were
collected from each pair (mother: areolar skin, breast milk, and vagina;
infant: mouth, skin, and stool). A single infant was found to be HIV-
infected through vertical transmission, and the corresponding mother-
infant dyad was excluded from all further analyses.
Microbiomes were related on the basis of individual, site,
and mother-infant pairs
We first looked broadly at the microbiomes at each sample site. DNA se-

 were classified into 698 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) using stan-
dard approaches (29) and mapped to the Greengenes database at ≥97%
identity(30).Principalcoordinatesanalysis(PCoA)andmultivariateanal-
ysis of variance (ANOVA) revealed site- and individual-dependent effects
on bacterial composition (Fig. 1A). Overall, a-diversity within sample di-
versity was relatively similar between sample sites (Fig. 1B); only vagi-
nal samples demonstrated significantly lower diversity than did the other
five sample sites (Shannon index, P = 0.021). Bacterial composition var-
ied by sample site (Fig. 1, C and D). For example, at the family taxo-
nomic level, areolar skin swab samples had more Pseudomonadaceae
compared to breast milk samples. Vaginal samples and infant stool
samples had a relatively greater abundance of Bifidobacteriaceae.
Overall, samples were related on the basis of individual, site, and
mother-infant pairs. Samples from an individual were more similar to
those from other sites on the same individual than they were when com-
pared to those from random individuals (P < 0.005) (fig. S1A). Likewise,
samples from the same body site were more closely related to each other
than to random sites (P < 0.005) (fig. S1B). When we looked specifically
at mother and infant pairs, we found that these pairs were more closely
related to each other than to random pairs (P < 0.005) (fig. S1C). Com-
parison of the relatedness of the various sample sites of the matched
mother and infant pairs versus random mother and infant pairs by per-
mutation test (unweighted UniFrac, t test) demonstratedthat breast milk
was closely related to all infant sites (fig. S1D). Infant stool was closely
related to all mother sample sites.
Minimal effects of HIV infection are detected on the
maternal microbiome
We next examined the effect of HIV infection on the maternal micro-
biome by comparing HIV-infected to uninfected mothers. PCoA re-
vealed minimal separation between the areolar skin, breast milk, or
vaginal samples and no differences between the HIV-positive and
HIV-negative mothers when each site was analyzed separately (Fig.
2A). Further, there were no significant differences in bacterial diversity
identified (Fig. 2B and table S1).
Comparing the relative abundance of bacterial taxa, we found differ-
ences in microbial composition based on maternal HIV status at all three
maternal sample sites in unadjusted analysis (table S2). However, when
we adjusted for multiple comparisons, bacterial compositions at all taxo-
nomiclevelsweremostlysimilarbetweenthetwomaternalgroups(Fig.2,
C and D). We only found one statistically significant [defined as false dis-
covery rate (FDR) P < 0.1] difference at the class level in vaginal samples
where b-proteobacteria was more abundant in HIV-negative mothers
(Fig. 2E). Given the previous studies identifying differences in the stool

 and had very high CD4 T cell counts (median, 567 cells/mm3), and their
stool was not tested. Notably, when we further analyzed our data based
on the history of maternal antibiotic use and BMI, no differences were
identified (table S3).
Mother’s HIV infection influences the infant microbiome
In contrast to the mostly consistent microbial communities identified in
the mothers, the microbiomes of HIV-exposed, uninfected and HIV-
unexposed, uninfected infants showed striking differences based on the
mother’s HIV status. Although PCoA demonstrated some separation
based on sample site, there was no clear separation between HIV-exposed,
uninfected and HIV-unexposed, uninfected infants when each site was
analyzedseparately (Fig.3A). Weobservedlowera-diversityin the stool
of HIV-exposed, uninfected infants compared to HIV-unexposed, un-
infected infants (Shannon index, P = 0.018; observed OTU, P = 0.005;
Chao,P= 0.017)(Fig.3B andtableS1).Furtherstratificationof theinfant
gut bacterial diversity by maternal CD4 T cell count (1 to 350 versus
>350) (fig. S2A) demonstrated a trend toward loss of diversity with lower
CD4 T cell counts. When we looked at maternal viral load (undetectable
versus detectable), we identified a dose-response relationship with HIV-
exposed, uninfected infants born to mothers with detectable viral loads
showing the least amount of a-diversity (fig. S2B).
Furthermore, the bacterial community taxonomic composition of
infant stool was significantly altered on the basis of the mother’s HIV
status. Looking at relative abundances, we observed many differences using
unadjustedP valuesat allsitesandat every taxonomic level(table S2).After
correction for multiple comparisons using FDR P < 0.10, 31 significant
differences persisted between the two groups (Fig. 3, C to E). These
changes were seen at all taxonomic levels but were most obvious at the
family level, where HIV-exposed, uninfected infants had more abundant
populations of Pseudomonadaceae and Thermaceae in their stool com-
paredtoHIV-unexposed,uninfectedinfants.Incontrast,HIV-unexposed,
uninfected infant stool had significantly more Prevotellaceae, Desulfo-
vibrionaceae, and Alcaligenaceae. HIV-unexposed, uninfected infants
also had significantly more Weeksellaceae in their mouth samples com-
pared to the HIV-exposed, uninfected infants.
We looked at these taxa more closely to make sure they were not
biased by other factors. We performed a permutational ANOVA (PER-
MANOVA) based on distance matrices to identify contributions to the
differences seen in infant stoolmicrobiome composition. We foundthat
maternal HIV status had the only statistically significant influence ac-
counting for about 8% of the differences (P = 0.004) (table S3). Age was
associated with about 15% of the variation but did not reach statistical
significance (P = 0.09). When these identified specific microbes were ana-
lyzed in relation to the child’s age- andsex-adjusted weight andlength, no
associations were found. Adjustments for a child’s anthropometric status
did not change maternal HIV status associations. When the analysis was
further run to account for the slight variation in age between infants, Pre-
votellaceae and Pseudomonadaceae remained significantly different be-
tween the two groups.
Further evidence for dysbiosis in HIV-exposed,
uninfected infants
After identifying the differences outlined above in the microbial commu-
nities of infants born to HIV-positive mothers, we looked for further ev-
idence of dysbiosis to better understand its origins. We applied a random

mothers). None of the infants received courses of antibiotics. Only one infant subsequently acquired HIV infection. This mother-infant dyad was excluded
from subsequent analyses. N/A, not applicable.

Downloaded from 
 forest classification scheme (14) to identify taxa associated with HIV
status. We found that at the family level, Prevotellaceae, Alcaligenaceae,
Desulfovibrionaceae, and Pseudomonadaceae in the infant stool were
most predictive of the mother’s HIV status (Fig. 4A). These are the same
taxa identified earlier as significantly different in the stool microbiomes
of the infants based on the mother’s HIV status using the FDR-corrected
P values based on relative abundances.
We then applied a Bayesian approach (31) to estimate the propor-
tion of microbes in the infant samples that came from the mother. The
mouth and skin microbiomes of infants were represented similarly in
both the HIV-unexposed, uninfected and HIV-exposed, uninfected in-
fant groups with strong influences from breast milk and areolar skin sites
(Fig. 4B). However, among HIV-exposed, uninfected infants, it appeared
that a greater proportion of the infant stool traced back to the mother’s
breast milk and areolar skin, although this finding was not statistically
significant. This may suggest that direct seeding of the infant gut via the
mother’s microbiome was increased in the context of HIV exposure.
We further looked at the infant microbial gut community by exam-
ining the relative maturity of the stoolmicrobiome. To do this, we applied
a previously published model using a random forest regression algorithm
to compare our infants against a cohort of healthy Bangladeshi infants
(32). A relative maturity index was calculated for each experimental
sample based on the relative stool microbiome age compared to the age
of the subject at collection. This was then plotted along with the normal-
ized midline of the previously published reference cohort of healthy con-
trols (Fig. 4C). HIV-exposed, uninfected infants had relatively less mature
gut microbial communities compared to HIV-unexposed, uninfected in-
fants (Wilcoxon rank sum, P = 0.03). When we specifically looked at the
33 age-discriminatory taxa, we found that a single species (Bacteroides
fragilis) was more abundant in HIV-unexposed, uninfected infants
(Wilcoxon rank sum, P = 0.025) (table S4).
Our next step was to look at the predicted metagenomic functional
content of the studied bacterial communities using PICRUSt analysis (33).

 HIV-exposedinfants.Intotal,theresultsofourrandomforestanalysis,source

ses provided further evidence that HIV infection in mothers was associated
with robust changes in the HIV-exposed, uninfected infant microbiome.
Disruptions in HMO composition correlate
with the infant microbiome
Weasked why the HIV-exposed, uninfected infants in ourstudy hadsig-
nificantly different and potentially dysbiotic gut bacterial communities
compared to the unexposed infants. We observed that the bacterial com-
munities of mothers with and without HIV infection in our cohort were
relatively similar. The disruptions seen in their infants were thus not
completely explained by the maternal-to-infant transfer. The normal suc-
cession of the infant microbiome is further driven by exposure to food
andthe environment.Allof the infantsin ourstudy were breastfed.Given
this,we nextexaminedthebreastmilkfromourcohort ofmothersinmore
detail. Here, we saw differences between HIV-infected and uninfected
mothers in their milk oligosaccharide composition. HMOs are not di-
gestible by infants but are primarily thought to provide metabolic sub-
strate for specific commensal bacterial communities. Changes in the HMO
content of a mother’s milkmay thus have profound downstream effects on
the establishment of the infant microbiome.

 HMO composition of breast milk was altered in HIV-positive compared
to HIV-negative women (Fig. 5A). The small sample size meant that
these differences did not reach statistical significance; however, they were
consistent with differences our group has previously reported from larger
samples of HIV-positive and HIV-negative women in Zambia (20, 23). The
relative abundance of 3′-sialyllactose (Wilcoxon rank sum, P = 0.067), 3-
fucosyllactose (P = 0.10), and 2′-fucosyllactose (P = 0.077) trended toward
being increased in breast milk from HIV-positive mothers compared to HIV-
negative mothers. In contrast, human milk lacto-N-tetraose (P = 0.064) and
lacto-N-neotetraose (P = 0.080) trended toward being increased in HIV-
negative mothers. All other HMO comparisons, including the total, the total
fucosylated, and the total sialylated HMOs, were similar when compared be-
tween HIV-positive and HIV-negative mothers.
Surprisingly, we saw few distinct differences in the breast milk bac-
terial communities between HIV-positive and HIV-negative mothers (Fig.
2). However, when we used Pearson correlations to define the associations
between specific HMOs and bacteria, we did see significant direct asso-
ciations with the infant stool bacteria (Fig. 5B). These correlations were
distinct and dependent on the mother’sHIV status. Forexample, in HIV-
negativemothers,increasesin3′-sialyllactosewerecorrelatedwithrelative
increases in Enterococcacceae and Fusobacteriaceae in the infant’s stool.
In contrast, when we looked at HIV-positive mothers, we found that an
increase in lacto-N-fucopentaose 1 in breast milk led to an increase in
Bifidobacteriaceae in the infant’s stool.
Next, we compared
the infant stool’s relative
maturity index to the
HMO composition of
the mother’s breast milk
using Spearman cor-
relation (Fig. 5C). Lacto-
N-tetraose, which was
relatively increased in
HIV-negative mothers,
was also significantly as-
sociated with increased
microbial maturity in
the infant’s stool (FDR
P = 0.003). In contrast,
3-fucosyllactose was rel-
atively increased in
HIV-positive mothers’
breast milk and was sig-
nificantly associated with
decreased infant stool
microbial maturity (FDR
P = 0.058). Together,
these data demonstrate
that the normal HMO
composition of breast
milk and the correla-
tions between HMOs
and the infant micro-
biome are lost or dis-
rupted based on maternal
HIV infection.
DISCUSSION
In 2013, an estimated 1.5 million women living with HIV gave birth, ac-
counting for nearly 20% of all births in sub-Saharan Africa (1). Although
mother-to-child transmission rates are decreasing due to improved avail-
ability of antiretrovirals (1), there is now a large and rapidly growing cohort
ofHIV-exposed,uninfectedinfants.Thesechildrenexperiencenearlytwice
the mortality rates compared to matched controls (7). The results of our
study show that maternal HIV infection is associated with changes in the
microbiome of HIV-exposed,uninfectedinfants. Furthermore, the HMO
content trended toward being different based on maternal HIV status.
Specific oligosaccharides appeared to be directly linked with specific
bacteria within the infant’s microbiome. These data suggest that maternal
HIV infection disruptsthe normaldevelopment of theinfantmicrobiome.
This relatively immature and dysbiotic microbiome potentially could com-
promise development of the infant’s immune system. This may help to
explain the higher morbidity and mortality of HIV-exposed, uninfected in-
fants compared to HIV-unexposed infants in the same communities.
We identified differences in the microbiomes of our cohort of Haitian
mother and infant pairs based on the mother’s HIV status. Most im-
portantly, we found significant differences in the microbiomes of HIV-
exposed, uninfected infants compared to the HIV-unexposed, uninfected
infants. This was most clearly demonstrated in the stool composition of
the HIV-exposed, uninfected infants but was also observed in the mouth

 and skin samples as well. Prevotella and Pseudomonas species have
both been associated with HIV infection in previous microbiome studies
(14, 15, 17, 34) and were significantly different in our HIV-exposed, un-
infected infant cohort as well. The reason for this relationship in HIV
infection remains unclear. Prevotella-rich bacterial communities have pre-
viously been associated with proinflammatory states including bacterial
vaginosis associated with HIV transmission (35–37). The gut mucosa of
HIV-infectedindividualsisinflamed.Recentstudiessuggestthatthechronic
gut inflammatory states seen in HIV-positive individuals may be related
to dendritic cell activation and association with Prevotella species (17, 38).
Although previous studies have shown differences in the stool micro-
biomes of infected versus uninfected individuals (14, 15, 17), the micro-
biomes in the body sites we investigated (vagina, breast milk, and areolar
skin) were relatively similar in HIV-infected versus HIV-uninfected
women. Initial studies in macaques looking at the stool microbiomes
based on the presence or absence of simian immunodeficiency virus in-
fection did not show significant differences in the microbial communities
between the two groups (39). Similarity in the microbiomes of HIV-
uninfected and HIV-infected women in our study is likely explained by
the fact that the HIV-infected women in our study had relatively intact
immune systems, were virologically suppressed with antiretroviral drug
therapy, were well nourished, and remained relatively healthy on anti-
retroviral therapy with good follow-up and health care. We also did not
study the mother’s stool microbiome; previous studies examining the
microbiomes of HIV-infected individuals have identified dysbiosis of
the gut microbiome.

 same community? We propose that it may be the combination of the
slight perturbations in the mother’s microbiome and differences in the
HMO composition of the mother’s breast milk that may explain these
differences. Although there were only minor differences in the mothers’
microbiomes, when we traced back to see the origins of the infants’ micro-
biome taxa, there was a clear influence from the mother. This was es-
pecially true in the HIV-positive mothers and their exposed infants.
TreatmentofHIV-infectedmotherswithantiretroviraldrugsmayfurther
contribute to the exposed infant’s disrupted microbiome. The reason for
differences in the HMO breast milk composition observed remains un-
clear but also may be associated with HIV infection itself or the anti-
retroviral medications.
With only very small differences in the breast milk microbial com-
munities, we believe that the HMOs produced in breast milk are not
directed toward the growth of specific bacteria within breast milk itself.
Rather, we propose that the changes in the HMO composition may have
downstream prebiotic effects on the growth and colonization of various
bacterial species in the infant microbiome. In this way, HMOs in breast
milk may be responsible for the dysbiosis seen in HIV-exposed un-
infected infants. We identified clear relationships between specific HMOs
altered by HIV infection that were associated with differences seen in the
infant’s stool microbiome. Many of these same HMOs have been identi-
fied as key components of breast milk in previous HIV studies (20, 23).
Unfortunately, little has been done to understand the relationships be-
tween HMOsandthe infantmicrobiomeinhumans.Correlationslinking
mother’s breast milk HMOs to specific bacteria have recently been identi-
fied in a study of 14 mother and premature infant dyads (40). Furthermore,
links between specific prebiotics and Prevotella communities in the gut
microbiome have been established previously in mice (41). It has also
been shown that Bifidobacterium species, thought to be beneficial, prefer-
entially predominate in the presence of lacto-N-neotetraose in germ-free
mice (42).
Identifying these differencesin themicrobiome of HIV-exposed, un-
infected infants and their origins is just the beginning of our under-
standing of this complex system. We found that the relative microbial
maturity of the HIV-exposed, uninfected infants’ stool was significantly
lower than that observed in the infants born to HIV-negative women.
This immaturity of the infant microbiome has been associated with a
decreased nutritional state (32). The next step will be to understand the
mechanisms by which the microbiome and HMOs work together to
affect the health of these at-risk HIV-exposed, uninfected infants. This
knowledge can then be applied toward developing interventions to pre-
vent the increased morbidity and mortality seen in HIV-exposed, un-
infected infants. Providing infants with important beneficial bacteria
(probiotics) or potentially specific milk oligosaccharides (prebiotics) may
potentially improve long-term outcomes, although this remains to be
thoroughly investigated and tested.
In-depth studies looking at the impact of prebiotics and probiotics in
HIV-exposed, uninfected infants are needed. Already, studies in simian
immunodeficiency virus–infected macaques have shown modest benefit
in preventing long-term gastrointestinal complications with the adminis-
tration of probiotics in combination with prebiotics (43). A study looking
at treating children in Malawi with high HIV prevalence for severe acute
gastroenteritis did not show improvement in outcomes with a combined
prebiotic and probiotic therapy (44). Probiotics alone appear to be useful
in decreasing the severity of necrotizing enterocolitis in premature HIV-
exposed,uninfectedinfantsbutdonotworkaswellastheydidintheHIV-
unexposed, uninfected cohort (45). With better understanding, we may be
able to target bacteria and HMOs that are most needed for normal devel-
opment and protection against morbidity and mortality in HIV-exposed,
uninfected infants.
Our study has several limitations. We looked at a cross-sectional
sampling of an at-risk population at a single site. The women in our
studyhadrelativelyhighCD4Tcellcounts,andwehavepreviouslyshown
that infant morbidity and mortality among HIV-exposed, uninfected in-
fants are inversely related to maternal CD4 T cell count (8). Prospective,
long-term, multicenter enrollment may better identify differences in
microbiomes and maternal breast milk HMO composition over time.
That being said, this is a relatively large microbiome study cohort with 50
mother and infant pairs including multiple sample sites. Furthermore,
many of the findings, such as some of the differences seen in bacterial
taxa and HMOs, have been identified in previous HIV studies from dif-
ferent geographic locations. HIV-infected mothers in our cohort had
higherBMIs andreceivedmore antibioticsduring pregnancy orthe peri-
partum period than did HIV-uninfected mothers. However, these param-
eters did not influence the microbiome of the infant and adjustment for
these and other covariates did not change associations of the infant mi-
crobiome with maternal HIV status. Selection bias in this impoverished
communitymayhaveselectedacohortofHIV-negativemothersathigher
risk of microbiome dysbiosis. This might explain why clear differences
were not observed in the microbiomes of HIV-infected and uninfected
mothers. Nevertheless, this bias is toward the null, suggesting that the dif-
ferences between HIV-exposed and HIV-unexposed infants that we ob-
served may be more marked than reported here.
We found that maternal HIV infection was associated with changes
in the microbiome of HIV-exposed, uninfected infants and further ob-
served that human breast milk oligosaccharides were associated with
specific bacterial species in these high-risk infants. This disruption of
the infant’s microbiome may contribute to the increased morbidity
and mortality observed for HIV-exposed, uninfected infants.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study design
We conducted a cross-sectional study of 50 mother and infant pairs
attending the Haitian Group for the Study of Kaposi’s Sarcoma and
Opportunistic Infections (GHESKIO) clinics in Port-au-Prince, Haiti:
25 women were HIV-infected and 25 were HIV-uninfected. Women
more than 15years of age who had delivered a baby in the past 6 months
and who were breastfeeding were eligible to participate in this study.
Participantswere excludedif they were unable to provide informedcon-
sent or if their child did not primarily feed via the breast. This study was
approved by the Institutional Review Boards of Children’s Hospital Los
Angeles, Columbia University, and GHESKIO.
At the time of the study visits, mothers were interviewed by study
personnel to collect clinical data. This included sociodemographic data,
current medications, pregnancy and delivery history, and infant feeding
details. All clinical data were entered into a database on site.
Sample collection
We prospectively collected demographic and clinical data and six
samples from each pair (mother: areolar skin, breast milk, and vagina;
infant: mouth, skin, and stool). Stool and breast milk samples were col-
lected in sterile containers and frozen at −20°C. Areolar skin, vaginal,
skin, and mouth mucosa swabs were placed in PSP DNA stabilization

 buffer(Stratec)beforebeing frozen.Aseparate controlswab wasexposed
to the air in the room at the time of collection and was placed in the
buffer as well.
Extraction
DNA was extracted from all sample types using the NucliSENS
easyMag following the manufacturer’s protocol. We homogenized the
frozen stool and breast milk samples in PSP stool stabilization buffer first.
Then, we used the PSP Spin Stool kit for extraction following the
manufacturer’s protocol, substituting Lysing Matrix E tubes (MP
Biomedicals) for the provided zirconia beads. Extracted DNA was
stored in elution buffer at −80°C.
Library preparation
We conducted library preparation on the extracted DNA from the six
samples above for each mother-infant pair. The 16S ribosomal DNA
was amplified in triplicate and barcoded using a previously published
protocol (46). Briefly, this protocol uses the V4 region of the 16S ribo-
somal RNA gene. Illumina flow cell adapter sequences and a 12–base
pair (bp) barcode region were incorporated into the polymerase chain
reaction primers. DNA amplicon concentrations were then quantified
on a 2200 TapeStation (Agilent Technologies).
Sequencing
We followed the detailed, massively parallel sequencing protocol as
presented previously by Caporaso et al. (46). Briefly, we pooled the am-
plicons and diluted to 2 nM. The amplicons were then denatured and
loaded on a MiSeq desktop sequencer (Illumina) using 2× 150-bp v2
chemistry. After cluster formation, the amplicons were sequenced with
specific primers designed to be complimentary to the V4 amplification
primers. The barcode was read using a third sequencing primer in an
additional cycle.
HMO analysis
HPLC was used to characterize HMOs in breast milk as previously de-
scribed (23). Briefly, 20 ml of human milk was spiked with the non-
HMOraffinoseasaninternalstandardtoallowforabsolutequantification.
Oligosaccharides were extracted by high-throughput, solid-phase extrac-
tion over C18 and Carbograph microcolumns and fluorescently labeled
with 2-aminobenzamide. Labeled oligosaccharides were analyzed by
HPLC on an amide-80 column (4.6-mm inner diameter, 25-cm length,
and 5-mm particle size; Tosoh Biosciences) with a 50 mM ammonium
formate–acetonitrile buffer system. Separation was performed at 25°C
and monitored with a fluorescence detector at 360-nm excitation and
425-nmemission. Peak annotationwasbasedon standardretentiontimes
and mass spectrometric analysis on a Thermo LCQ Duo Ion trap mass
spectrometer equipped with a nano-ESI source. The totalconcentration of
HMOs was calculated as the sum of the most common oligosaccharides.
The proportion of each HMO per total HMO concentration was
calculated.
Statistics
Analysis of the sequencing data was carried out using QIIME 1.8.0 (29).
Briefly, reads were merged using fastq-join and then demultiplexed.
Open reference OTU picking was performed using UCLUST at 97%
similarity using the Greengenes 13.8 database (30, 47). Chimeras were
removed using the mothur implementation of ChimeraSlayer (48). The
resulting OTU table was filtered at a minimum abundance threshold of
0.005%, giving a total of 698 OTUs. A rarefaction depth of 16,737 reads
was selected because most samples were sufficiently saturated. a- and
b-diversity statistics and taxonomic compositions were calculated as
previously described (29).
Additional statistical analyses were performed using R (version
3.0.3). For comparisons of demographic data, either Fisher’s exact test
or Wilcoxon rank-sum tests were used as appropriate. Comparisons of
a- and b-diversity distances were performed using a nonparametric t
testwith1000permutations. Comparisonsofbacterialabundanceswere
performed using a bootstrapped Kruskal-Wallis test with 1000 permu-
tations. Comparisons of HMO composition were performed using a
Wilcoxon rank-sum test. All P values were adjusted for multiple com-
parisons using the Benjamini-Hochberg method, except where indi-
cated otherwise. FDR-corrected P values of <0.1 were considered
significant. We assessed the genetic effects on microbiome composition
by comparing distances between true mother-infant pairs versus 1000
permutations of randomly drawn pairs of mothers and infants.
Random forest analysis was performed as previously described (15),
using HIV status as the outcome and family-level taxa abundances as
the covariates. Source tracking analysis was performed using Source-
Tracker v0.9.5 (31). Relative maturity distributions between HIV-exposed,
uninfected and HIV-unexposed, uninfected infants were compared using
aWilcoxonrank-sumtest.Analysisofthepredictedmetagenomewasper-
formed using the PICRUSt software package (33). To help identify truly
important relationships, significant differences were accepted only for
FDR-corrected P values of <0.05 in this metagenome analysis.
To identify relationships between HMO levels and selected bacterial
abundances, Spearman correlation coefficients were calculated for all
pairs of HMO levels and bacterial abundances where at least 10 samples
had nonzero abundance. P values were calculated using 1 million per-
mutations. Because the purpose of this analysis was primarily hypothesis
generation, all relationships with a FDR-corrected P value of <0.2 were
accepted as significant. We further evaluated HMOs compared to the
relative maturity index using Spearman correlations. FDR-corrected
P values of <0.1 were considered significant.
