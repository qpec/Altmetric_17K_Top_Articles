 patients fail to respond to corticosteroid therapy, there is considerable need for therapeutics for this 
disorder. Identifying therapeutics for DBA requires circumventing the paucity of primary patient 
blood stem and progenitor cells. To this end, we adopted a reprogramming strategy to generate 
expandable hematopoietic progenitor cells from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from DBA 
patients. Reprogrammed DBA progenitors recapitulate defects in erythroid differentiation, which 
were rescued by gene complementation. Unbiased chemical screens identified SMER28, a small-
molecule inducer of autophagy, which enhanced erythropoiesis in a range of in vitro and in vivo 
models of DBA. SMER28 acted through autophagy factor ATG5 to stimulate erythropoiesis and 
up-regulate expression of globin genes. These findings present an unbiased drug screen for 
hematological disease using iPSCs and identify autophagy as a therapeutic pathway in DBA.
INTRODUCTION
The blood system is a classical developmental hierarchy in which hematopoietic stem and 
progenitor cells (HPCs) continuously replenish a pool of short-lived mature cells. The 
discovery of induced pluripotency has opened new avenues to regenerative medicine, 
including disease modeling, to gain insights into pathophysiology and drug screening 
against disease-relevant human cells. A large number of induced pluripotent stem cell 
(iPSC) models have been established from patients with hematological diseases (1–6). 
However, inability to derive hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and multipotential HPCs has 
hampered the ability to interrogate disease mechanisms and discover therapeutics using 
patient-derived iPSCs (1). We previously reported generation of expandable multilineage 
progenitors from iPSCs using five transcription factors (5F; ERG, HOXA9, RORA, SOX4, 
and MYB) (7). Doxycycline (Dox)–regulated conditional induction of 5F expanded 
immature CD34+CD38− blood progenitors (CD34-5F) and removal of Dox initiated 
differentiation. CD34-5F cells gave rise to short-term engraftment after transplantation in 
immunodeficient mice, with erythroid progenitors undergoing maturation and hemoglobin 
switching in vivo. This system has the potential to generate large numbers of engraftable 
patient-specific cells for modeling hematological diseases.
Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA) is a severe macrocytic anemia that usually presents in the 
first year of life (8). DBA is associated with mutations in ribosomal protein genes, most 
commonly RPS19 and RPL5 (9). Loss of a single allele of RPS19 perturbs the assembly of 
40S ribosomal subunits, and loss of an RPL5 allele perturbs the 60S subunit assembly. These 
disruptions affect the normal stoichiometry of ribosomal subunits, which leads to ribosomal 
stress and apoptosis of erythroid progenitors (10, 11). Erythroid differentiation in DBA is 
arrested at the earliest progenitor stage, the erythroid burst-forming unit (BFU-E) (12, 13). 
Corticosteroids, such as dexamethasone (DEX), induce proliferation of erythroid progenitors 
and are a first-line treatment for DBA. Only about half of patients respond to steroids, and 
some patients lose their response over time and must be managed with lifelong transfusions. 
Thus, there is a considerable need for new therapeutics for this disorder.
Identifying new therapeutics for DBA is critically dependent on circumventing the paucity 
of primary patient HPCs. Mouse models of DBA have been reported (14–17) but do not 
recapitulate all aspects of human disease or enable drug screening. Knockdown of RPS19 by

 short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) in human CD34+ progenitors is often used as a model system 
(10, 18); however, it is difficult to achieve precise haploinsufficient protein dosage or cell 
expansion owing to reduced proliferative capacity. DBA iPSCs recapitulate aspects of the 
disease (3), opening the possibility of drug screening against disease-relevant human cells. 
Here, we use a reprogramming approach to carry out an unbiased drug screen with blood 
disorder patient iPSCs and identify SMER28, a small-molecule modulator of autophagy, as a 
candidate therapeutic for DBA.
RESULTS
Generation of reprogrammed progenitors from DBA iPSCs
To establish a model of DBA, we reprogrammed fibroblasts from patients with RPS19 and 
RPL5 inactivating mutations. We established independent cell lines of normal karyotype 
(table S1) and confirmed the heterozygous nonsense mutation in iPSCs by Sanger 
sequencing (Fig. 1A and fig. S1A). Fibroblasts from patient T15 showed the expected 
decrease in RPS19 protein, but RPS19 expression was not decreased in patient iPSCs (Fig. 
1B and fig. S1B), suggesting that the remaining copy of RPS19 is sufficient to maintain 
normal protein expression in iPSCs. RPS19 protein was decreased in erythroid cells 
differentiated from patient iPSCs, showing dosage dependence in disease-affected blood 
cells (Fig. 1C).
DBA iPSCs gave rise to comparable numbers of CD34+ hematopoietic progenitors (fig. S2), 
but these progenitors had reduced potential to differentiate into CD71+ glycophorin A 
(GlyA)+ erythroid cells (fig. S3A). Expression of p21 was higher in DBA erythroid cells 
(fig. S3B), as noted in other models of DBA (12). However, we were unable to carry out 
further characterization because of the limited proliferative capacity of iPSC HPCs. To 
overcome this limitation, we adopted a transcription factor–based reprogramming system to 
expand iPSC-derived HPCs (7). HPCs isolated on day 14 of differentiation were transduced 
with 5F lentiviruses (CD34-5F cells). After 2 weeks of expansion, Dox was removed, and 
CD34-5F progenitors were differentiated into red blood cells (RBCs) (Fig. 1D) (19). In this 
protocol, CD34-5F progenitors transitioned through the same morphological stages as cord 
blood (CB) CD34+ cells (Fig. 1E) (19). CD34-5F RBCs retain some embryonic features in 
vitro, such as expression of embryonic and fetal globins and low efficiency of enucleation, 
but undergo globin switching and enucleation after engraftment in vivo (7). Total expansion 
was >1 × 104–fold, corresponding to >109 RBCs from an average differentiation batch (fig. 
S3C). This system overcomes inefficient differentiation of iPSCs to generate large numbers 
of disease-specific HPCs.
DBA iPSCs recapitulate early erythroid defect in vitro
A block in differentiation at the early BFU-E or erythroid colony-forming unit (CFU-E) 
progenitor stage is a hallmark of DBA, and we observed this phenomenon during 
differentiation of DBA iPSCs using the CD34-5F system. Normal iPSCs efficiently gave rise 
to early erythroblasts distinguished by basophilic cytoplasm due to high ribosome content. 
By contrast, we found virtually no erythroblasts when differentiating the RPS19 and RPL5 
mutant patient iPSCs (Fig. 1F). The number and frequency of CD71+GlyA+ cells were also

 reduced (Fig. 1F, bottom, and fig. S4, A and B). Furthermore, DBA CD34-5F cells 
generated normal numbers of myeloid but reduced numbers of BFU-E and CFU-E colonies, 
indicating a specific loss of erythroid progenitors (Fig. 1G). iPSC-derived erythroblasts 
displayed molecular changes characteristic of DBA patient cells, including increased 
frequency of apoptotic cells and expression of p21 (fig. S4, C and D). Thus, the CD34-5F in 
vitro system recapitulates erythroid defects found in DBA.
DBA iPSCs recapitulate erythroid defect after transplant
To further assess the erythroid potential of DBA iPSCs, we transplanted CD34-5F cells into 
NOD-SCIDγc null (NSG) mice. Four weeks after transplant, CD34-5F cells from normal 
iPSCs gave rise to both GlyA+CD45− erythroid and GlyA−CD45+ myeloid cells (Fig. 2A). 
By contrast, DBA CD34-5F cells gave rise to myeloid cells but showed little erythroid 
engraftment (Fig. 2A, fig. S4E, and table S2). The human erythroid graft consisted 
predominantly of mature orthochromatic normoblasts and some enucleated reticulocytes 
(Fig. 2B), consistent with our previous observations that iPSC-derived cells undergo 
maturation in vivo (7). Because engraftment capacity differed for each iPSC line, we 
monitored the proportion of erythroid cells relative to total human engraftment to normalize 
RBC output. Normal iPSC-derived CD34-5F cells yielded 75 ± 6.0% erythroid contribution, 
whereas CD34-5F cells from DBA patients contributed 13 ± 6.8% erythroid engraftment 
(Fig. 2C and table S2). These data demonstrate that DBA CD34-5F cells display reduced 
erythroid potential in vitro and in vivo.
Gene complementation rescues erythroid defect
To demonstrate that the erythroid defect in RPS19+/− DBA iPSCs is driven by the RPS19 
mutation, we inserted a single copy of RPS19 or an irrelevant red fluorescent protein (RFP) 
gene into the safe harbor adeno-associated virus integration site 1 (AAVS1) locus using 
CRISPR/Cas9. Multiple independent RPS19-complemented iPSC clones showed 
significantly improved erythroid potential compared to starting DBA iPSCs and RFP 
controls in vitro (Fig. 2D; P < 0.001). RPS19 complementation also restored erythroid 
engraftment of DBA progenitors in vivo (Fig. 2E). To independently validate these findings, 
we generated iPSC lines from the unaffected parents of an RPL5 patient who did not carry 
the mutation. Parental lines displayed normal erythroid differentiation (Fig. 2F), indicating 
that defective erythropoiesis is likely due to the RPL5 mutation rather than to other 
mutations. These data show that the erythroid defect observed in our DBA model is driven 
by disease-associated RPS19 and RPL5 mutations.
Chemical screens identify compounds that rescue erythroid differentiation
Establishing a robust model that recapitulated clinical features of the disease allowed us to 
carry out unbiased drug screens to discover candidate therapeutics for DBA. To this end, we 
developed approaches to screen chemical libraries for enhanced proliferation or 
differentiation of erythroid cells differentiated from DBA CD34-5F cells. We screened the 
Sigma LOPAC library of 1280 pharmacologically active small molecules plus 160 selected 
bioactive compounds (1440 in total) at a concentration of 5 μM and identified compounds 
that displayed erythroid rescue of DBA lines (Fig. 3A, fig. S5A, and table S3). Hits 
previously linked with DBA included DEX (18), transforming growth factor–β inhibitor

 SB431542 (20), and ROCK1 inhibitor Y27632 (21). SMER28, a quinazolinamine derivative 
previously characterized as an inducer of autophagy (22, 23), displayed the largest dose-
dependent effect on erythroid differentiation and was characterized further. SMER28 
increased the absolute number of CD71+GlyA+ erythroid cells from RPS19 and RPL5 
mutant DBA iPSCs in a dose-dependent manner with a median effective concentration 
(EC50) of 1.5 μM (95% confidence interval, 0.63 to 2.37 μM) (Fig. 3B and fig. S5, B and C). 
We did not observe increased cytotoxicity at drug doses up to 20 μM (fig. S5D). SMER28 
had a smaller effect on control iPSCs (DBA, 9.8-fold; control, 2.5-fold; EC50 = 1.6 μM) 
(Fig. 3B). To confirm SMER28 activity in an independent model of DBA, we transduced CB 
CD34+ progenitors with shRNAs for RPS19 (shRPS19) or control shRNAs targeting an 
irrelevant luciferase gene (shLUC). As expected, RPS19 knockdown inhibited erythroid 
differentiation, and treatment withSMER28 stimulated erythroid output, with the highest 
activity at ~0.5 μM (Fig. 3, C and D). Last, we tested a 1.0 μM dose of the compound on 
primary CD34+ cells from bone marrow (BM) samples of four DBA patients and observed 
improved erythroid differentiation (Fig. 3E). These data suggest that SMER28 promotes 
erythropoiesis in both normal and DBA cells, with a greater proportional response in 
diseased cells.
SMER28 enhances erythropoiesis in vivo
To assess the therapeutic potential of SMER28 in vivo, we first tested it in a zebrafish model 
of DBA. Mutations in ribosomal protein genes, such as rps29, cause DBA-like anemia in 
zebrafish (24). RPS29 is also mutated in a subset of DBA patients (25). Rps29−/− zebrafish 
are anemic, as revealed by lack of hemoglobin staining in the yolk sac; treatment with 
SMER28 for 40 hours postfertilization (hpf) increased hemoglobin staining (Fig. 4A). More 
than 50% of embryos treated with 1 μM SMER28 showed high expression of hemoglobin, 
compared to 20% for vehicle controls (P = 0.00002) (Fig. 4B). Thus, SMER28 ameliorates 
anemia in a zebrafish model of DBA.
Next, we evaluated the effects of administration of SMER28 to mice with irradiation-
induced anemia, a model that enables dose finding and initial testing of drug safety and 
bioactivity. We measured expression of the autophagic marker LC3B in treated animals to 
assess drug bioactivity and saw that LC3B-I and LC3B-II were increased in the liver, 
indicative of drug activity (fig. S6A). Irradiated mice treated with SMER28 (10 mg/kg) had 
elevated RBC counts (P = 0.07) and hematocrit (P = 0.04) compared to vehicle controls (Fig. 
4C). Although Rps19+/− mice do not develop anemia, conditional heterozygous deletion of 
Rpl11 leads to a DBA-like disease (15). We tested the effect of SMER28 in an Rpl11+/fl/Mx-
Cre mouse model in which the excision of exon 2 of Rpl11 is induced by 
polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid [poly(I:C)] double-stranded RNA. Treatment with poly(I:C) 
resulted in anemia with decreased RBC counts [Fig. 4D; compare −poly(I:C) to +poly(I:C)]. 
Anemic mice treated with vehicle alone for 2 weeks displayed stable disease, whereas 
animals receiving SMER28 (20 mg/kg) showed significant improvement in RBC counts 
(Fig. 4D; P = 0.004). These data provide preliminary evidence of the efficacy of SMER28 in 
a mouse model of DBA.

 To test the effects of this compound on human cells, we treated mice transplanted with 
CD34-5F and CB cells. SMER28 increased the output of GlyA+ RBCs from DBA CD34-5F 
cells (Fig. 4E). Administration of SMER28 (2 mg/kg) for 4 weeks to mice transplanted with 
CB CD34+ cells increased the erythroid contribution to human graft (13.0% versus 5.5% 
RBCs as proportion of human graft; P = 0.05) (Fig. 4, F and G). Although DEX also 
increased RBC output (15.3%; P = 0.04), it nearly abolished human B cells, consistent with 
its lymphotoxic effects (Fig. 4G). By contrast, SMER28 specifically increased erythroid 
cells without affecting the distribution of myeloid and lymphoid lineages (Fig. 4G). These 
data establish preliminary evidence for in vivo efficacy of SMER28 as a therapeutic for 
DBA in zebrafish, mouse, and human cell models.
SMER28 acts on CD34+ erythroid precursors
Erythropoiesis is a multistep process initiated by erythroid progenitors that culminates with 
their differentiation into enucleated RBCs. A key advantage of the CD34-5F system is that 
cells initiate differentiation in a synchronous manner after Dox withdrawal. To identify the 
cell types responsive to SMER28, we treated CD34-5F cells during sequential stages of 
erythropoiesis. CD34+ progenitors treated during the initial expansion phase displayed 
increased output of GlyA+ cells (Fig. 5, A and B). By contrast, treatment of erythroblasts 
during stage I of differentiation did not affect the output of GlyA+ cells (Fig. 5B; “stage I”). 
We validated these findings in a CB CD34+ model. SMER28 treatment of CD34+ 
progenitors transduced with shRPS19 was sufficient to improve erythroid output (Fig. 5C). 
These data indicate that SMER28 acts on CD34+ progenitors to promote erythroid 
differentiation. In contrast to SMER28 treatment of CD34+ cells that yielded comparable 
amounts of RBCs compared to vehicle control, treatment of erythroblasts during stages I to 
III of differentiation enhanced the output of iPSC- and CB-derived mature RBCs (Fig. 5D) 
and increased the efficiency of enucleation (2.4 ± 1.2% DMSO versus 5.6 ± 1.6% SMER28) 
(Fig. 5, E and F). These data indicate that SMER28 acts on immature erythroid precursors 
and mature erythroblasts to increase generation of RBCs.
SMER28 induces globin expression
To better understand how SMER28 stimulates erythroid differentiation in the context of 
ribosomal deficiency, we performed expression profiling on CB CD34+ cells 5 days after 
transduction with shLUC and shRPS19. Genes up-regulated by SMER28 in CB- and iPSC-
derived progenitors showed enrichment in the Gene Ontology (GO) categories 
mitochondrion, hemoglobin, and methyltransferase (Fig. 6A). Ribosomal deficiency causes 
a delay in the expression of globin proteins and transcripts, which inhibits erythroid 
differentiation (26), and consistent with this report, we found that globin transcripts were 
down-regulated in CB shRPS19 cells (19 ± 9% shRPS19 versus shLUC, P = 0.0002) (Fig. 
6B). GATA1 targets and genes comprising the erythroid-specific gene-regulatory network 
(27) remained relatively unperturbed at this stage (Fig. 6B and fig. S6B). SMER28 up-
regulated expression of globin genes in shRPS19 compared to shLUC cells (P = 0.0003), but 
GATA1 targets and erythroid-specific gene expression were relatively unaffected by 
SMER28 (Fig. 6C and fig. S6C). Early changes in globin expression were indicative of 
durable changes during erythroid development. CD71+ erythroblasts differentiated from 
SMER28-treated precursors retained increased expression of globin genes (Fig. 6D), and we

 found a similar improvement in primary DBA patient cells (fig. S6D). These data suggest 
that RPS19 deficiency causes a rapid decline in globin transcription, and SMER28 
stimulates globin gene expression.
Autophagy factor ATG5 is required for SMER28 activity
SMER28 was first identified as a mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR)–independent 
inducer of autophagy in models of neurodegenerative disease (22, 23, 28). Autophagy is a 
prosurvival pathway induced by stresses, such as nutrient limitation or protein aggregation, 
and is required for clearance of mitochondria in terminal erythroid maturation (29), but it 
has not been linked with earlier stages of erythropoiesis. To confirm that SMER28 
modulates autophagy in erythroid cells, we interrogated the expression of autophagy 
substrate p62 and autophagosome marker LC3B in K562 erythroleukemia cells. SMER28 
increased the expression of lipidated LC3B-II isoform associated with autophagosomes and 
enhanced clearance of p62 (Fig. 7A). Conversion of cytosolic LC3B-I into LC3B-II was also 
induced by cytotoxic 5-fluorouracil and occurred in the presence of actinomycin D, 
indicating that it was independent of transcription (Fig. 7A). p62 expression was increased 
after knockdown of RPS19 or RPL5, indicating that ribosomal deficiency interferes with 
autophagic clearance (fig. S7A). We next used an LC3-GFP reporter to monitor 
autophagosomal LC3 during erythroid differentiation of DBA CD34-5F cells and saw that 
LC3 expression was increased in CD71+ erythroblasts treated with SMER28 (fig. S7B). 
These data show that SMER28 induces autophagy during erythroid differentiation.
To measure autophagic flux, we monitored LC3B and p62 expression after blocking 
lysosomal fusion with bafilomycin A (bafA). As expected, LC3B-II expression increased 
after lysosomal blockade, indicative of an accumulation of autophagosomes (Fig. 7B; 
compare DMSO −bafA to +bafA). Similar to the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin, SMER28 
enhanced this accumulation, suggesting that it promotes autophagosome formation (Fig. 7B; 
compare +bafA DMSO to SMER). p62 expression was not affected by the lysosomal 
blockade (Fig. 7B and fig. S7C); however, clearance of p62 by SMER28 and rapamycin was 
blocked in the presence of bafA, whereas its transcript expression was unchanged (fig. S7, C 
and D). These data suggest that the effect of SMER28 in erythroid cells is consistent with 
enhanced autophagic flux.
Rapamycin induces autophagy but suppresses protein synthesis, which is deleterious to DBA 
cells. However, rapamycin enhanced the erythroid potential of wild-type progenitors and 
synergized with SMER28 (fig. S7E). Because chemical inhibition or induction of autophagy 
typically affects multiple pathways, we transduced CD34-5F progenitors with shRNAs for 
ATG5, which is required for LC3B lipidation and autophagosome formation, to directly test 
the role of autophagy factors in SMER28 function. Knockdown of ATG5 using three 
independent shRNAs reduced the effect of SMER28 on erythroid differentiation (5.4-fold 
shLUC versus 1.8-fold shATG5, P < 0.00001) (Fig. 7C). Erythroid differentiation was not 
affected by the ~50% knockdown of ATG5 (fig. S7F). We next examined the effect of ATG5 
on globin gene expression. Similar to results seen in CB CD34+ cells, globin transcripts 
were up-regulated by SMER28 in CD34-5F cells (P = 0.001) (Fig. 7D). Knockdown of 
ATG5 did not affect the expression of globin transcripts (P = 0.79) but completely blocked

 their induction by SMER28 (Fig. 7D and fig. S7G). These data suggest that reduction of 
ATG5 to haploinsufficiency does not perturb erythropoiesis in our iPSC model but reveals its 
critical role in mediating SMER28 function.
To test the role of ATG5 in erythropoiesis in vivo, we depleted atg5 in zebrafish using a 
previously characterized morpholino (30), which did not cause morphological or 
developmental defects (fig. S7H). Injection of atg5, but not missense, morpholino robustly 
depleted ATG5 protein expression (fig. S7I). Depletion of atg5 in wild-type zebrafish caused 
anemia, and SMER28 failed to stimulate erythropoiesis after atg5 depletion (Fig. 7E; 
rps29+/+). By contrast, loss of atg5 did not affect the remaining erythropoiesis in rps29−/− 
zebrafish, suggesting that ribosomal protein loss is epistatic to autophagy (Fig. 7E and fig. 
S7J; rps29−/− missense versus atg5 morpholino). Although SMER28 stimulated 
erythropoiesis in rps29−/− zebrafish injected with missense morpholino, it had no effect in 
the context of atg5 depletion (Fig. 7E). Together, these findings indicate that autophagy 
factor ATG5 plays an important role in erythropoiesis by mediating canonical autophagy or 
alternative pathways, and SMER28 stimulates erythropoiesis by acting through ATG5.
DISCUSSION
Reprogramming cells to an induced pluripotent state is a powerful tool to create models of 
human disease. Patient-specific iPSCs have been characterized for many hematological 
disorders, including anemias, neutropenia, myeloproliferative disease, chronic myeloid 
leukemia, and immunodeficiencies (1–6). iPSCs overcome the limitations of accessing 
primary patient cells to enable drug screening against pathologic human cellular phenotypes. 
Blood progenitors can be readily generated by direct differentiation from iPSCs; however, 
they are largely myeloid lineage–restricted and lack proliferative and engraftment potential. 
These shortcomings have curtailed the power of iPSC models, and drug screens for blood 
disorders have not been reported to date. We combined directed differentiation with 
reprogramming to endow iPSC-derived HPCs with self-renewal and multilineage 
differentiation potential (7). As a proof of principle, we used this platform to carry out drug 
screens for DBA and identified SMER28, a small-molecule inducer of autophagy, as a 
candidate therapeutic.
Our findings suggest that SMER28 stimulates erythropoiesis by promoting autophagy in 
erythroid progenitors. Autophagy plays important roles in development, homeostasis, and 
cancer, and is induced to cope with cellular stresses in response to nutrient deprivation and 
protein aggregation (31, 32). The role of autophagy in hematopoiesis is only beginning to be 
elucidated. Autophagy serves a cytoprotective function in HSCs (33, 34) and is required for 
clearance of mitochondria in terminal erythroid maturation (29). Expression of autophagic 
genes is directly activated by the erythroid master regulator GATA1 (35); however, the role 
of autophagy in early erythroid development has not been established. SMER28 increases 
autophagic flux in erythroid cells, and loss of ATG5, which is required for autophagosome 
assembly, blocks the effects of SMER28 on erythropoiesis. It remains possible that ATG5 
mediates these effects independent of autophagic cargo degradation because ATG5 has been 
shown to regulate innate immunity and pathogen resistance through LC3B-assisted 
phagocytosis (36–38). Although these findings suggest that autophagy may be dysregulated

 in DBA, it may also be a generally favorable mechanism in early erythropoiesis. A previous 
study has found increased autophagic activity in DBA (39), although our findings point to a 
defect in autophagic turnover. Detailed genetic and biochemical studies are required to 
elucidate the status of autophagy and its contribution to DBA pathophysiology.
Delayed expression of globin genes in primary DBA cells has been reported to lead to 
accumulation of free heme and heme toxicity, which perturbs erythroid differentiation (26). 
We show that knockdown of RPS19 in CD34+ progenitors rapidly inhibited expression of 
globin transcripts. SMER28 up-regulated globins in RPS19-deficient cells, providing an 
explanation for its rescue of erythroid differentiation in DBA. This globin induction was 
dependent on ATG5, suggesting that modulation of autophagy or closely related pathways 
alters erythroid gene expression. Atg5-deficient zebrafish are anemic, indicating that ATG5 
plays a role in erythroid development. Autophagy has been recently shown to affect 
erythropoiesis through degradation of the iron storage protein ferritin (40, 41). Future 
studies will need to establish how autophagic signals induce erythroid gene expression and 
stimulate erythroid differentiation.
The current standard of care for DBA involves treatment with corticosteroids. However, 
steroids have potent immunosuppressive effects, as seen by the ablation of human 
lymphocytes in DEX-treated mice in our studies. Because SMER28 will undergo extensive 
derivatization to improve pharmacokinetics, it is too early to gauge its efficacy relative to 
steroids. SMER28 did not perturb other hematopoietic lineages and was well tolerated in our 
dose escalation studies. For patients who do not respond to steroids, SMER28 or its 
derivatives may be viable alternatives to lifelong transfusions. In summary, we report an 
unbiased drug screen for hematological disorders using patient iPSCs leading to the 
discovery of a candidate therapeutic for DBA. The reprogrammed progenitor cell model 
developed here will enable large-scale genetic and chemical screens in a variety of disease 
contexts and will serve as a paradigm for continued efforts to reprogram readily accessible 
patient cells into HSCs.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study design
The goal of the study was to identify therapeutics for DBA. The study used iPSCs as a drug 
discovery model. A candidate therapeutic, SMER28, was tested in independent in vitro and 
in vivo DBA models including primary patient samples, CB, zebrafish, and mouse. The 
drug’s mechanism of action during erythroid differentiation was studied in erythroid cell 
lines, iPSCs, and zebrafish using genetic tools and biochemical assays. Cells from two DBA 
patients were reprogrammed, and two independent iPSC lines were derived from each 
patient. Three control iPSC lines were obtained from unaffected individuals. Experiments 
were performed in triplicate, unless otherwise stated, with at least three biological replicates 
(independent DBA and control iPSC lines). Drug effects were measured relative to vehicle 
control. Mice were assigned randomly to groups. Zebrafish hemoglobin staining was scored 
blindly as low (little/no staining), medium (patched staining), and high (consistent staining 
across yolk sac). Data points were combined from all independent biological replicates and 
experiments, and outliers were not excluded.

 Patient samples and reprogramming
Skin fibroblasts were obtained by biopsy from DBA patient T15 (UPN NCI 131-1) enrolled 
in an open cohort study (NCI 02-C-0052, ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT00027274) approved 
by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Institutional Review Board (IRB). Skin fibroblasts 
were obtained from patient T5 according to the institutional guidelines approved by the 
Boston Children’s Hospital (BCH) IRB. Patient fibroblasts were independently 
reprogrammed with episomal and Sendai methods. Control iPSC lines used in this study, 
CD45-IPS and CD34-IPS, were reprogrammed from normal donors and MSC-IPS1 (42). 
The episomal protocol was used as previously described with modifications (43). The 
Amaxa nucleofector was used according to the manufacturer’s instructions with 1 μg of each 
plasmid (Addgene). After plating, medium was changed daily for 6 days. At day 6, cells 
were split, and after 24 hours, medium was changed to KnockOut serum replacement 
(KOSR)–based human embryonic stem cell (ESC) medium. Integration analysis was 
performed using the EBNA TaqMan assay. For Sendai reprogramming, fibroblasts were 
reprogrammed using the CytoTune-iPS Sendai Reprogramming Kit (Thermo). All lines 
were characterized by karyotyping. The summary of iPSC lines is shown in table S1.
DBA patient BM samples were obtained from the NCI BM failure cohort. Patient 1 (ID: 
NCI UPN 50-1) had an RPS19 R62Q mutation, patient 2 (ID: NCI UPN 193-1) had an 
RPS29 I31F mutation, patient 3 (NCI UPN 131-1) had an RPS19 R94X mutation, and 
patient 4 (NCI UPN 282-1) had an RPS19 c.43G>T (p.Val15Phe) mutation. BM samples 
were separated with Ficoll (GE), and CD34+ cells were isolated by flow sorting as detailed 
below.
iPSC culture
Human iPSC lines were maintained on Matrigel (BD) in mTeSR1 (STEMCELL 
Technologies; subsequently Stemcell) medium. Media were changed daily, and cells were 
passaged at a ratio of 1:8 to 1:10 every 5 to 7 days using standard passaging techniques with 
Dispase (Stemcell). Before initiating differentiation, colonies were passaged once onto 
mouse embryonic fibroblasts (GlobalStem) in human ESC medium [Dulbecco’s modified 
Eagle’s medium (DMEM)/F12 + 20% KOSR, 1 mM L-glutamine, 1 mM nonessential amino 
acids (NEAA), 0.1 mM β-mercaptoethanol (β-Me) (all purchased from Life Technologies), 
and basic fibroblast growth factor (10 ng/ml) (Gemini)].
Embryoid body differentiation
Embryoid body (EB) differentiation was performed as previously described (44). Briefly, 
iPSC colonies were scraped into nonadherent rotating 10-cm plates. EB medium was KO-
DMEM (Thermo) + 20% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Stemcell), 1 mM L-glutamine, 1 mM 
NEAA, penicillin/streptomycin, 0.1 mM β-Me, holo-transferrin (200 μg/ml) (Sigma), and 
ascorbic acid (50 μg/ml) (Sigma). After 24 hours, medium was changed and supplemented 
with the following growth factors: bone morphogenic protein 4 (BMP4) (50 ng/ml) (R&D), 
stem cell factor (SCF) (300 ng/ml), Fms-related tyrosine kinase 3 ligand (FLT3) (300 ng/
ml), granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (50 ng/ml), interleukin-6 (IL-6) (20 ng/ml), and 
interleukin-3 (IL-3) (10 ng/ml) (all purchased from PeproTech). Medium was changed on 
days 5 and 10. EBs were dissociated on day 14 with collagenase B (Roche), followed by 
Doulatov et al.

 treatment with enzyme-free dissociation buffer (Gibco). Dissociated EBs were frozen in 
10% DMSO (Sigma) and 40% FBS.
Lentivirus and shRNA plasmids
5F lentiviral plasmids HOXA9, ERG, RORA, SOX4, and MYB were in pInducer-21 
lentiviral vector (Addgene). shRNAs for RPS19 (TRCN0000074915 and 
TRCN0000074914), RPL5 (TRCN0000291973 and TRCN0000291975), and ATG5 
(TRCN0000330392, TRCN0000330394, and TRCN0000330395) were from Sigma in 
pLKO.1 lentiviral vector. Lentiviral particles were produced by transfecting 293T-17 cells 
(American Type Culture Collection) with the lentiviral plasmids and third-generation 
packaging plasmids. Virus was harvested 24 hours after transfection and concentrated by 
ultracentrifugation. All viruses were titered by serial dilution on 293T cells.
EB progenitor sorting
Dissociated EB cells were thawed using Lonza Poietics protocol and resuspended at 1 × 
106/100-μl staining buffer (PBS + 2% FBS). Cells were stained with a 1:50 dilution of CD45 
PE-Cy5 (Immu19.2; Clontech), CD34 PE-Cy7 (8G12; BD), and 4′,6-diamidino-2-
phenylindole (Molecular Probes) for 20 min at room temperature. All sorting was performed 
on a BD FACS Aria II cell sorter using a 70-μm nozzle.
CD34-5F culture
Sorted CD34+CD45+ EB progenitors were seeded on RetroNectincoated (Takara; 10 μg/
cm2) 96-well plates at a density of 2 × 104 to 5 × 104 cells per well in Serum-Free 
Expansion Medium (SFEM) (Stemcell) with SCF (50 ng/ml), FLT3 (50 ng/ml), 
thrombopoietin (TPO) (50 ng/ml), IL-6 (50 ng/ml), and IL-3 (10 ng/ml) (R&D). Lentiviral 
infections were carried out in a total volume of 150 μl. The multiplicity of infection (MOI) 
for ERG and HOXA9 is 5, whereas the MOI for RORA, SOX4, and MYB is 3. Virus was 
concentrated onto cells by centrifuging at 2500 rpm for 30 min. Infections were carried out 
for 24 hours. After gene transfer, CD34-5F cells were cultured in SFEM + SCF (50 ng/ml), 
FLT3 (50 ng/ml), TPO (50 ng/ml), IL-6 (50 ng/ml), and IL-3 (10 ng/ml) (R&D). Dox was 
added at 2 μg/ml (Sigma). Cultures were maintained at a density of <1 × 106 cells/ml, and 
medium was changed every 3 to 4 days. After 14 days, CD34-5F cells were plated according 
to the erythroid protocol or transplanted in vivo.
Erythroid differentiation
Differentiation was performed as previously described (19), with the following 
modifications. CD34 expansion phase (4 days): To initiate differentiation, we cultured 
CD34-5F cells in SFEM progenitor medium (see CD34-5F culture) without Dox. Stage I (5 
days): Medium was changed to IMDM + 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) (Gibco), 20% 
FBS, 1 mM L-glutamine, penicillin/streptomycin, holo-transferrin (500 μg/ml) (Sigma), 
human insulin (10 μg/ml) (Cell Sciences), 1 μM β-estradiol, 1 μM DEX, 6 U erythropoietin 
(EPO) (Cell Sciences), SCF (100 ng/ml), and IL-3 (5 ng/ml) (PeproTech). Cells were seeded 
at a density of <1 × 105 cells/ml in 24-well plates. Stage II (4 days): Medium was changed 
to IMDM + 1% BSA, 20% FBS, 1 mM L-glutamine, penicillin/streptomycin, h-transferrin

 (500 μg/ml), human insulin (10 μg/ml), 6 U EPO, and SCF (50 ng/ml). Cells were seeded at 
a density of <2 × 105 cells/ml in 24-well plates. Stage III (10 days): Medium was changed to 
IMDM + 1% BSA, 20% FBS, 1 mM L-glutamine, penicillin/streptomycin, holo-transferrin 
(500 μg/ml), human insulin (10 μg/ml), and 2 U EPO. Cells were seeded at a density of <5 × 
105 cells/ml in 24-well plates.
Statistics
All statistical calculations were performed using GraphPad Prism. Tests between two groups 
used two-tailed unpaired or paired Student’s t test. Significance between high, medium, and 
low levels of hemoglobin staining was defined by binomial test. Data are presented as means 
± SEM or SD as indicated.
Inducing autophagy to improve anemia
Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA) is a rare blood disorder characterized by insufficient red 
blood cell production that is treated with corticosteroids and transfusion therapy. To identify 
additional therapeutics for DBA, Doulatov et al. performed a chemical screen with 
hematopoietic progenitor cells derived from iPSCs from two DBA patients with RPS19 and 
RPL5 genetic mutations. The autophagy inducing small-molecule SMER28 rescued 
erythroid differentiation in an autophagy factor ATG5-dependent manner in iPSC-derived 
patient cells, in zebrafish models of DBA, and in several mouse models. These results 
demonstrate the utility of iPSC-based screens for drug discovery for rare blood disorders and 
identify SMER28 and the autophagy pathway as promising targets for DBA therapy.

 Fig. 6. SMER28 induces globin expression
CB CD34+ progenitors transduced with shLUC or shRPS19 were treated with DMSO or 
SMER28 (10 μM) for 72 hours under expansion conditions. RNA was isolated from sorted 
GFP+ cells (positive for shRNA) after a total of 5 days in culture. (A) GO annotation of 
transcripts up-regulated by SMER28 (P < 0.1, >1.5-fold) in CB shRPS19 (left) or CD34-5F 
progenitors (right). Number of genes annotated (#), P value, and Benjamini-corrected P 
value for each GO category are shown. Common GO terms in blue. ATP, adenosine 5′-
triphosphate. (B) Normalized expression of genes specific to the erythroid lineage after 
knockdown of RPS19 in CB CD34+ cells. Erythroid gene regulatory network (GRN) is 
composed of 235 erythroid-specific genes as predicted by CellNet (28). Predicted GATA1 
targets (TRANSFAC database), heme synthesis (GO: 0006783), and expressed globin genes 
are included. Expression in CB shRPS19 is shown relative to shLUC control. (C) 
Normalized expression of genes comprising the erythroid GRN, predicted GATA1 targets, 
heme synthesis, and globin genes after SMER28 treatment of CB shRPS19 cells. Expression 
is shown relative to DMSO-treated CB shRPS19 cells. For (B) and (C), data are shown as 
means ± SD of two CB shRPS19 and shLUC samples. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.001 by paired t 
test with Bonferroni multiple testing correction. (D) Expression of transcripts for globin 
genes HBG, HBE, and HBA1 during erythroid differentiation in CD34+ precursors and 
CD71+ erythroblasts. CD34-5F cells were treated with SMER28 for the last 48 hours of 
expansion. Compound was removed, and cells were switched to stage I conditions. CD71+ 
erythroblasts were purified after 48 hours, and quantitative polymerase chain reaction 
(qPCR) was performed on CD34+ precursors (end of expansion) and purified CD71+ cells. 
Shown as means ± SD of two independent experiments.
