SUMMARY
Effector T cells and fibroblasts are major compo-
nents in the tumor microenvironment. The means
through which these cellular interactions affect che-
moresistance is unclear. Here, we show that fibro-
blasts diminish nuclear accumulation of platinum in
ovarian cancer cells, resulting in resistance to plat-
inum-based chemotherapy. We demonstrate that
glutathione and cysteine released by fibroblasts
contribute to this resistance. CD8+ T cells abolish
the resistance by altering glutathione and cystine
metabolism
in
fibroblasts.
CD8+
T-cell-derived
interferon (IFN)g controls fibroblast glutathione and
cysteine through upregulation of gamma-glutamyl-
transferases and transcriptional repression of sys-
tem xc� cystine and glutamate antiporter via the
JAK/STAT1 pathway. The presence of stromal fibro-
blasts and CD8+ T cells is negatively and positively
associated with ovarian cancer patient survival,
respectively. Thus, our work uncovers a mode of
action for effector T cells: they abrogate stromal-
mediated chemoresistance. Capitalizing upon the
interplay
between
chemotherapy
and
immuno-
therapy holds high potential for cancer treatment.
INTRODUCTION
Initial clinical response of ovarian cancer patients to surgical de-
bulking and chemotherapy with platinum-based drugs is often
excellent. However, relapse and metastasis due to drug resis-
tance is common and patients oftentimes succumb to their dis-
ease. Studies regarding chemoresistance in ovarian cancer have
focused on cancer genetic alterations, apoptosis, and drug
metabolism. However, it is unknown whether and how effector
CD8+ T cells play a role in drug resistance.
The human cancer immune microenvironment holds the key to
understanding the nature of immunity in response to tumor pro-
gression and tumor immunotherapy (Topalian et al., 2015; Zou,
2005; Zou et al., 2016). Interestingly, the efficacy of chemo-
therapy, radiotherapy, and oncologic antibody targeting therapy
also depends upon interferon signaling and CD8+ T cell immunity
(Binder et al., 2015; Lee et al., 2009; Zitvogel et al., 2010).
Regardless of the type of therapy, the presence of tumor-infil-
trating CD8+ T cells is a favorable prognostic factor in many
types of cancer, including ovarian cancer (Peng et al., 2015;
Sato et al., 2005; Zhang et al., 2003; Zhao et al., 2016). This
raises the possibility that CD8+ T cells may play a role in the
prevention of chemoresistance in human cancer. In the current
work, we have tested this possibility in the context of ovarian
cancer.
In addition to T cells and tumor cells, fibroblasts are one of
the major cellular components in the tumor microenvironment.
Tumor-associated fibroblasts are involved in immune regulation
(Kraman et al., 2010) and tumor progression (O
¨ zdemir et al.,
2014) in tumor bearing mouse models. Thus, in the current
work, we examined the potential interaction between CD8+
T cells and fibroblasts in ovarian cancer and found that this
interaction shapes the balance between chemotherapeutic
resistance and sensitivity in ovarian cancer. We have further
dissected the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms
and its pathological relevance in patients with ovarian cancer.
RESULTS
Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts Confer Platinum
Resistance to Ovarian Cancer Cells
High grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC) is the most
aggressive subtype of epithelial ovarian cancer. To test if
HGSOC-associated fibroblasts play a role in platinum resistance,

 we isolated fibroblasts from HGSOC tissues for our studies
(Table S1). Polychromatic flow cytometry analysis showed that
fibroblasts were CD45�, epithelial cell adhesion molecule nega-
tive (EPCAM�), CD24�, CD44+, CD105+, and platelet-derived
growth factor receptor-alpha positive (PDGFRA+) (Figure S1A).
Immunofluorescence staining showed that isolated fibroblasts
expressed alpha-smooth muscle actin (a-SMA) (Figure S1B).
We isolated primary epithelial ovarian cancer cells (OC8)
from a patient with HGSOC (Cui et al., 2013). TP53 mutation is
a feature of HGSOC (Domcke et al., 2013). We sequenced
TP53 gene in OC8 and found that OC8 carried a hotspot TP53
mutation on exon 6 (Figure S1C; Table S2) (Soussi et al., 2010).
Next, we inoculated the mixture of GFP-labeled OC8 and
primary fibroblasts into female NOD.SCID gc-deficient (NSG)
mice and treated the mice with cisplatin. Fibroblasts had minimal
effect on tumor volume in the control mice that were not treated
with cisplatin (Figure 1A). However, tumor volume was increased
in the cisplatin-treated mice injected with both OC8 and
fibroblasts, compared with the cisplatin-treated mice injected
with OC8 alone (Figure 1A). TUNEL assay demonstrated less
cisplatin-induced apoptosis in tumor cells in the presence of
fibroblasts (Figure 1B).
A2780 ovarian cancer cells are used in cisplatin resistance
studies. Whether A2780 are HGSOC may be controversial
(Domcke et al., 2013). We mixed fibroblasts with A2780 and
inoculated subcutaneously into nude mice and treated the
mice with cisplatin. Similar to the OC8 model, fibroblasts pro-
tected A2780 from cisplatin-mediated apoptosis (Figures 1C
and 1D). Immunohistochemistry demonstrated the existence of
SMA+ fibroblasts in tumors established by injection of both fibro-
blasts and cancer cells (Figure S1D). Thus, fibroblasts enhance
cisplatin resistance in ovarian cancer cells in vivo.
When we co-cultured A2780 with fibroblasts in vitro, we
found that fibroblasts protected tumor cells from cisplatin-
induced apoptosis as shown by reduced proportion of Annexin
V+ tumor cells (Figure 1E) in a dose-dependent manner (Fig-
ure S1E). To further investigate if the protective effects from
fibroblasts required cell-to-cell contact, we cultured A2780
with fibroblasts in a Transwell and observed that all three
fibroblast samples protected A2780 from cisplatin-induced
apoptosis (Figure 1F). We observed similar protective effects
of fibroblasts on OC8 (Figure 1G) and NIH:OVCAR3 (Figure 1H),
another p53 mutant HGSOC cell (Table S2) (Domcke et al.,
2013), and cisplatin-sensitive TOV21G ovarian cancer cells
(Figure S1F). We collected serum-free culture medium from fi-
broblasts (fibroblast medium) and performed identical experi-
ments. Fibroblast medium also protected A2780 and OC8
from cisplatin-induced apoptosis (Figures 1I and 1J). We
extended our studies to include carboplatin and oxaliplatin
and observed similar results (Figures S1G and S1H). Thus, fi-
broblasts release soluble factor(s) and promote platinum resis-
tance in ovarian cancer cells.
CD8+ T Cells Abolish Fibroblast-Mediated
Chemoresistance by IFNg
The presence of CD8+ T cells is associated with prolonged sur-
vival in cisplatin-treated ovarian cancer patients (Zhang et al.,
2003; Zhao et al., 2016). To examine the potential involvement
of CD8+ T cells in fibroblast-mediated platinum resistance,
we collected the supernatants from activated CD8+ T cells and
added it into the fibroblast and ovarian cancer cell co-culture
system. We found that CD8+ T cell-derived supernatants abol-
ished the protective effects of fibroblasts on cisplatin-induced
apoptosis in tumor cells (Figure 2A). We next pre-treated
fibroblasts with CD8+ T cell supernatants and again fibroblasts
lost the protective function on cancer cells treated with cisplatin
(Figures 2B and S2A). The fibroblast numbers (Figure S2B)
and viability (Figure S2C) were not changed by CD8+ T cell
supernatants.
IFNg is a major effector cytokine produced by CD8+ T cells.
We detected high levels of IFNg in the activated CD8+ T cell-
derived supernatants (Figure 2C). We hypothesized that CD8+
T cell-derived IFNg abolished the protective effect of fibroblasts.
To test this, we pre-treated the fibroblasts with IFNg and
observed more apoptotic A2780 (Figure 2D) or OC8 (Fig-
ure 2E) cells in the cultures containing IFNg-primed fibroblasts
compared to control fibroblasts. IFNg treatment had no effect
on fibroblast cell numbers or apoptosis (Figures S2B and S2C).
Moreover, we cultured fibroblasts with CD8+ T cell supernatant
in the presence of neutralizing anti-IFNg receptor 1 (IFNGR1)
antibody (Figure 2F) or JAK inhibitor I (Figure 2G). IFNg signaling
blockade restored the protective effect of fibroblasts on
cisplatin-induced tumor cell apoptosis (Figures 2F and 2G).
Thus, effector CD8+ T cells abolish fibroblast-mediated chemo-
resistance through the IFNg signaling pathway.
We further tested the effect of IFNg on fibroblast-mediated
cisplatin resistance in the OC8 bearing NSG model in vivo.
IFNg administration had no effect on tumor volume (Figure 2H).
However, IFNg administration increased the therapeutic efficacy
of cisplatin treatment as shown by reduced tumor volume (Fig-
ure 2H). Thus, IFNg diminishes fibroblast-mediated platinum
resistance in vivo.
Fibroblasts Reduce Platinum Intracellular Content in
Cancer Cells
Cisplatin induces cytotoxicity mainly through DNA damage-
mediated apoptosis (Wang and Lippard, 2005). To uncover
the
molecular
mechanism
of
fibroblast-mediated
cisplatin
resistance, we first examined whether fibroblasts change the
cisplatin-induced apoptotic signaling pathway in cancer cells.
Cisplatin treatment activated caspase 3 and caspase 9 in
A2780, while the presence of fibroblasts reduced their activation
(Figure S3A). Cisplatin causes DNA crosslinking and stimulates
H2AX phosphorylation at Serine 139 to generate gH2AX as a
major marker for DNA damage signaling in response to DNA

 double-strand break (Revet et al., 2011). When ovarian cancer
cells were cultured with fibroblasts, cisplatin-triggered gH2AX in
A2780, OC8, and OVCAR3 was reduced (Figure 3A). Immuno-
fluorescence staining confirmed that fibroblast medium also
reduced gH2AX in cisplatin-treated A2780 (Figure S3B). More-
over, immunohistochemistry revealed that in the fibroblast and

 ovarian tumorcellco-injectionanimal model(Figure 1),fibroblasts
led to decreased levels of gH2AX in tumor cells following cisplatin
treatment (Figure 3B). Thus, fibroblasts may control cisplatin
resistance in cancer cells at the DNA damage induction level.
Reduced intracellular cisplatin content can be linked to less
DNA damage (Galluzzi et al., 2012; Wang and Lippard, 2005).
Inductively coupled plasma-high resolution mass spectrometry
(ICP-MS) measurement revealed that intracellular cisplatin con-
tent was reduced in whole A2780 cells in the presence of fibro-
blasts with different concentrations of cisplatin (Figure 3C).
Similar effects were observed in A2780 (Figure 3D) and OC8 (Fig-
ure 3E) using fibroblasts from several clinical specimens. Dimin-
ished cisplatin content was also detected in the genomic DNA of

cisplatin-treated A2780 (Figure 3F) and
OC8 (Figure 3G) cultured with fibroblasts.
The presence of fibroblast-conditioned
medium from different ovarian cancer pa-
tients also resulted in diminished cisplatin
accumulation in the genomic DNA of
cisplatin-treated tumor cells (Figure S3C).
Using an antibody specific for cisplatin-
DNA adducts, we found that cisplatin-
DNA
adduct
formation
in
OC8
was
decreased in the presence of fibroblasts
(Figure 3H). In support of this observation, fibroblasts led to
decreased tumor cell accumulation of cisplatin (Figure 3I) in
tumor cells in cisplatin-treated mice (OC8-NSG model) (Fig-
ure S3D). Thus, fibroblasts confer cisplatin-resistance in ovarian
cancer cells by reducing intracellular cisplatin accumulation.
To further investigate the causal link between CD8+ T cell-
derived IFNg and cisplatin tumor accumulation in vivo, we
adoptively transferred CD8+ T cells into the mice bearing tumors
established with a mixture of tumor cells and fibroblasts and
treated the mice with anti-human IFNg antibody and cisplatin.
Twenty-four hours after the treatment, we enriched GFP-labeled
tumor cells (Figure S3D) and found platinum content was
reduced by anti-human IFNg (Figure 3J). Thus, fibroblasts confer
1096
Cell 165, 1092–1105, May 19, 2016
 cisplatin-resistance in ovarian tumor cells by reducing intracel-
lular cisplatin accumulation and CD8+ T cell-derived IFNg abol-
ishes this effect.
Fibroblast-Mediated Chemoresistance Is Linked to
Intracellular Glutathione Level
We dissected the mechanisms by which fibroblasts reduce
cisplatin intracellular accumulation. Intracellular cisplatin con-
tent is regulated through cisplatin influx or efflux transporters
(Wang and Lippard, 2005). We found that fibroblasts neither
decreased the expression of cisplatin influx transporters nor
increased the expression of cisplatin efflux transporters in tumor
cells (Figure S4A). Cisplatin can be chelated by glutathione and
the glutathione (GSH)-platinum complex subsequently effluxes
from the cell (Chen and Kuo, 2010). We observed that after co-
culture with fibroblasts, the intracellular GSH level was increased
in A2780 (Figure 4A), OC8 (Figure 4B), and OVCAR3 (Figure S4B).
Similarly, fibroblast medium increased the intracellular GSH level
in tumor cells compared to fresh culture medium and tumor cell
medium (Figure 4C).
Next, we investigated whether intracellular GSH level in tumor
cells affected their apoptotic response to cisplatin. N-acetyl
cysteine (NAC) is a GSH precursor. Buthionine sulfoximine
(BSO) is an inhibitor of glutamate-cysteine ligase, the first rate-
limiting enzyme of glutathione synthesis. NAC increased intra-
cellular GSH level (Figure 4D), decreased the level of cisplatin-
induced gH2AX (Figure 4E), reduced platinum content in
genomic DNA (Figure 4F), and protected ovarian tumor cells
from cisplatin-induced apoptosis (Figure S4C). BSO treatment
decreased intracellular GSH level (Figure 4G), increased plat-
inum DNA content (Figure 4H), and promoted cisplatin-induced
apoptosis (Figure 4I) in A2780. Similarly, BSO treatment
increased cisplatin-induced apoptosis in OC8 (Figure S4D)
and OVCAR3 (Figure S4E). Treatment with NAC or BSO in the
absence of cisplatin had no effect on the viability of A2780,
OC8, and OVCAR3 (Figures 4I and S4C–S4E). Next, we con-
structed a short hairpin RNA (shRNA) vector to downregulate
the expression of glutamate-cysteine ligase catalytic sub-
unit (GCLC) in A2780. shGCLC downregulated the protein
expression of GCLC (Figure S4F), decreased intracellular GSH
level (Figure 4J), and promoted cisplatin-induced apoptosis
(Figure 4K).
GSH monoester is utilized to regulate intracellular GSH levels
(Ma
˚ rtensson and Meister, 1989). We found that GSH monoester
reduced tumor accumulation of cisplatin in vivo (Figure 4L).
Accordingly, tumor volume was increased in mice treated with
GSH monoester plus cisplatin as compared to cisplatin treat-
ment alone (Figure 4M). Thus, GSH monoester diminished the
therapeutic efficiency of cisplatin in ovarian tumors in vivo. Alto-
gether, fibroblast-mediated chemoresistance is linked to high
intracellular GSH in ovarian cancer cells.
Fibroblast-Derived GSH and Cysteine Confer
Chemoresistance in Tumor Cells
Fibroblasts release soluble factor(s), elevate intracellular GSH,
and reduce intracellular cisplatin content in tumor cells. To iden-
tify these fibroblast-released factor(s), we divided the fibroblast
medium or tumor cell medium (control) into two fractions based
on a 3 kDa molecular weight cutoff filter. We found that the frac-
tion with <3 kDa molecular size, but not the faction with >3 kDa
molecular size, inhibited cisplatin-induced apoptosis (Figure 5A)
and increased intracellular GSH level (Figure 5B) in A2780. When
fibroblast medium was incubated with dextran-coated charcoal
for removing hormones and steroids, the protective effect was
diminished (Figure S5A). When fibroblast medium was treated
with trypsin or proteinase K digestion, the protective effect was
not changed (Figure S5B). Thus, the fibroblast factor(s) may be
small molecules, rather than protein(s) or large peptide(s).
Given that fibroblast medium increased tumor cell intracellular
GSH level, we hypothesized that the fibroblast-derived small
molecule(s) were related to GSH metabolism. GSH is the major
thiol-containing component synthesized de novo in mammalian
cells (Lushchak, 2012). We detected higher levels of thiols in
fibroblast medium than in fresh culture medium or in A2780 me-
dium (Figure 5C). Fibroblast medium contained 25–50 mM GSH
compared to <1 mM GSH in fresh medium and in A2780 medium
(Figure 5D). We confirmed high GSH levels in fibroblast medium
from six additional patient samples (Figure S5C). These data
suggest that in addition to GSH, there are other thiol compo-
nent(s) in the fibroblast medium. GSH, cysteine, cysteine-
glycine (Cys-Gly), and g-glutamyl-cysteine (g-Glu-Cys) are four
thiol-containing metabolites. We measured these metabolites
by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) (Figures
S5D and S5E). We detected <3 mM of cysteine-glycine and
g-glutamyl-cysteine in all mediums, <10 mM of cysteine in fresh
medium and tumor medium, and 70–100 mM of cysteine in fibro-
blast medium (Figure 5E). Thus, the major thiol components in
fibroblast medium are GSH and cysteine. Fibroblast-derived
GSH and cysteine may mediate the protective effect from
cisplatin-induced tumor apoptosis. We showed that exogenous
GSH (Figures 5F–5H) and cysteine (Figures 5I–5K) increased
intracellular levels of GSH (Figures 5F and 5I), decreased plat-
inum DNA accumulation (Figures 5G and 5J), and protected
ovarian tumor cells from cisplatin-induced apoptosis (Figures
5H and 5K).
Cystine is a precursor of cysteine, which is the rate-limiting
substrate for GSH synthesis (Zhang et al., 2012). Hence, we
hypothesized that manipulation of cystine would alter levels of
endogenous GSH and cysteine in fibroblasts and consequently
impact their protective effect on tumor cells. To this end, we
generated fibroblast medium with or without cystine (cystine+
or cystine�) complementation. We showed that cystine defi-
ciency (cystine�) resulted in dramatic reduction of total thiol (Fig-
ure 5L) and GSH (Figure 5M) in fibroblast medium. Functionally,
cystine+, but not cystine�, fibroblast medium reduced Annexin
V+ tumor cells in response to cisplatin (Figure 5N). Therefore,
fibroblasts utilize cystine to generate and release cysteine
and GSH, which leads to tumor cell uptake of cysteine and
GSH to elevate intracellular GSH, ultimately resulting in cisplatin
resistance.
CD8+ T Cells Alter GSH/Cystine Metabolism and xCT
Expression in Fibroblasts
Fibroblast-mediated cisplatin resistance was abolished by
IFNg and CD8+ T cells (Figure 2). Next, we tested whether
IFNg and CD8+ T cells targeted GSH and cysteine metabolism
Cell 165, 1092–1105, May 19, 2016

 in fibroblasts. Treatment of fibroblasts with IFNg or CD8+ T cell
supernatants reduced the total thiol (Figures 6A and S6A) and
GSH (Figures 6B and S6B) in fibroblast medium. Neutralizing
anti-IFNGR1 antibody disabled the effects of CD8+ T cells on
fibroblasts-derived thiol and GSH (Figures S6A and S6B).
Gamma-glutamyltransferases (GGT), the only enzyme of the
gamma-glutamyl cycle present on the cell membrane, controls
GSH homeostasis by breaking down extracellular GSH (Lush-
chak, 2012). We observed that IFNg stimulated the mRNA
expression of GGT5 (Figure 6C) and increased the GGT enzy-
matic activity in fibroblasts (Figure 6D), but not in tumor cells
(Figures S6C and S6D). Moreover, we found positive correlations
between GGT5, CD8 (Figure S6E), and an IFNg responsive gene,
interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF1) expression (Figure S6F) in
the microdissected stroma compartments from HGSOC speci-
mens (GEO: GSE40595) (Yeung et al., 2013). We further explored

shGGT5
and scrambled shRNA similarly protected tumor cells from
cisplatin-induced apoptosis (Figures 6E and S6G). IFNg treat-
ment abolished the protective function of fibroblasts expressing
scrambled shRNA and partially reversed this protective function
of fibroblasts expressing shGGT5 (Figure 6E). These data sug-
gest that IFNg targets GGT5 in fibroblasts to accelerate GSH
degradation and in turn partially reduces the protective activity
of fibroblasts on cisplatin-induced tumor cell apoptosis.
Next, we analyzed whether IFNg and CD8+ T cells could regu-
late cysteine level in fibroblasts. We measured both cysteine and
cystine (Figures S6H and S6I) with LC-MS in the cultured fibro-
blast medium. IFNg treatment reduced cysteine and increased
cystine in fibroblast medium (Figure 6F). This suggests that
IFNg treatment slows down cysteine synthesis by reducing
cystine consumption in fibroblasts. Treatment with IFNg or
CD8+ T cell supernatants resulted in decreased 14C-Cystine up-
take in fibroblasts at multiple time points (Figures 6G and S6J),
but not in tumor cells (Figure S6K). To further evaluate the effects
of CD8+ T cells on fibroblast-mediated chemoresistance, we
pretreated fibroblasts with IFNg and found that these fibroblasts
restored intracellular cisplatin accumulation (Figure 6H) and
cisplatin-induced gH2AX expression (Figure 6I) in tumor cells.
System xc� cystine/glutamate antiporter is a membrane
amino acid transporter that mediates the exchange of extracel-
lular cystine and intracellular glutamate, which is a heterodimer
composed of the 4F2 heavy chain (SLC3A2) and the light chain
xCT (Ishimoto et al., 2011). We found that the expressions of
xCT and SLC3A2 protein were both reduced by IFNg in fibro-
blasts (Figure 6J). Knockdown of xCT expression in fibroblasts
attenuated fibroblast-mediated cisplatin resistance in A2780
(Figure 6K). The effect of IFNg on regulation of system xc� is
cell-type-specific. IFNg treatment had no effect on xCT and
SLC3A2 expressions in tumor cells (Figure S6L). Cystine trans-
porter xCT expression was higher in fibroblasts than tumor cells
(Figure S6M). Thus, IFNg restricts the production of cysteine and
promotes the degradation of GSH in fibroblasts through down-
regulating system xc� and upregulating GGT expression and
consequently abrogates the protective effects of fibroblasts on
cisplatin-induced apoptosis in tumor cells.
We dissected the mechanism by which IFNg regulated system
xc� and GGT expression in fibroblasts. We monitored the dy-
namic expression of xCT, SLC3A2, and GGT5 mRNA in fibro-
blasts upon IFNg treatment. Twenty-four hours after IFNg treat-
ment, we detected a moderate increase in the expression of
GGT5 mRNA (Figure 6L). However, the expression of xCT, but
not SLC3A2 mRNA, was sharply decreased within 4 hr of IFNg
treatment and continued to decrease during the experimental
time period (Figure 6L). In contrast, expression of the classical
IFNg responsive genes IRF1 and CXCL10 rapidly increased
within 4 hr (Figure S6N). Given the rapid and potent changes in
xCT and high expression of xCT in fibroblasts, we particularly
focused on xCT regulation by IFNg.
Rapid downregulation of xCT mRNA by IFNg suggests a
potential direct transcriptional regulation at the levels of pre-
mRNA and/or mature mRNA. We observed that the xCT pre-
mRNA level was rapidly decreased in fibroblasts within 30 min
of IFNg treatment and continued to decrease following the
experimental time period (Figures 6M and S6O). CXCL10 pre-
mRNA was rapidly induced by IFNg (Figure S6P). We then con-
ducted a RNA polymerase II (Pol II) chromatin immunoprecipita-
tion (ChIP) assay. RNA Pol II occupancy at the transcription start
site was comparable in fibroblasts treated with or without IFNg;
however, the occupancy in xCT intragenic regions was attenu-
ated after IFNg treatment (Figures 6N and S6O). In addition,
IFNg had no effect on the Pol II occupancy at both TSS and intra-
genic regions of xCT in OC8 (Figure S6Q). Thus, IFNg treatment
had no effect on RNA Pol II loading onto xCT promoter, but
potentially decreased elongation of RNA Pol II into xCT gene
body, and ultimately resulted in xCT transcriptional repression
in fibroblasts.
Janus kinase (JAK) and STAT1 mediate cellular response
to IFNg stimulation. We observed that IFNg induced STAT1
phosphorylation in fibroblasts within 5 min and increased IRF1
protein expression within 2 hr, but decreased xCT protein
expression within 8 hr (Figure 6O). JAK inhibitor I reversed
IFNg-mediated downregulation of xCT pre-mRNA and mature
mRNA in fibroblasts (Figure S6R). STAT1 homodimers bind
to DNA at the gamma interferon activation site (GAS) of the
consensus sequence. We analyzed the STAT1 ChIP sequencing
(ChIP-seq) database of IFNg-simulated K562 or HeLa cells in
the ENCODE project. We found three potential STAT1 binding
sites at the xCT promoter region: one at intron1 (GAS1), one
near the TSS (GAS2), and one upstream of promoter (GAS3)
(Figure 6P). We conducted STAT1 ChIP assay on fibroblasts
and OC8. ChIP data demonstrated that IFNg exclusively

 enhanced STAT1 binding to the GAS2 region in fibroblasts
(Figure 6Q), while IFNg treatment resulted in increased STAT1
binding to both GAS1 and GAS2 regions in tumor cells (Fig-
ure S6S). To assess whether the GAS2 element in xCT promoter
is involved in the regulation of xCT expression, we performed
xCT promoter luciferase reporter assays. Similar to the full-
length xCT promoter, the luciferase activity of reporter construct
carrying GAS2, not GAS1 and GAS3, was repressed by IFNg
treatment (Figure 6R). These results suggest that the GAS2
element near the xCT TSS may selectively be linked to
IFNg-mediated xCT transcriptional repression in fibroblasts.
Altogether, our data demonstrates that IFNg represses xCT
transcriptional expression in fibroblasts.
Clinical Impact of Fibroblasts and Stromal CD8+ T Cells
on Chemoresistance
Finally, we examined the relationship between stromal fibro-
blasts, chemoresistance, and potential association with stromal
CD8+ T cells in HGSOC patients whose clinical and pathological
information was available (Table S3). Based on their responses
to platinum-based chemotherapy, we divided patients into che-
mosensitive and chemoresistant groups. As expected, overall
survival was much shorter in chemoresistant patients compared
to chemosensitive patients (Figure 7A; Table S3).
Next, we quantified a-SMA+ fibroblasts in the tumor stroma
with immunohistochemistryin ovarian tumor tissues (Figure S7A).
Based on the stromal a-SMA staining score, patients were
divided into ‘‘a-SMAlow’’ and ‘‘a-SMAhigh’’ groups. We observed
that high stromal a-SMA expression was associated with poor
overall survival (Figure 7B; Table S3). We further observed that
increased tumor stromal fibroblasts strongly correlated with
chemoresistance (Table S4), and the proportion of high levels
of stromal fibroblasts were elevated in chemoresistant patients
compared to chemosensitive patients (Figure 7C).
To determine whether the association between stromal fibro-
blasts and patient survival (Figure 7C) is linked to platinum
response, we adjusted for platinum response and compared
the significance of stromal fibroblasts using Cox’s proportional
hazard regression (Table S5). We found that stromal fibroblasts
were not associated with patient survival when platinum resis-
tance was included as a covariant in regression analysis (Table
S5). Altogether, these data indicate that the levels of stromal
fibroblasts in ovarian tumors correlate with platinum response
and affect patient survival by modulating chemotherapeutic
response.
We quantified CD8+ T cells in the tumor stroma (Figure S7B).
Based on the stromal CD8+ T cell levels, patients were divided
into ‘‘CD8low’’ and ‘‘CD8high’’ groups (Table S3). We observed
that high levels of stromal CD8+ T cells were associated with
improved overall survival (Figure 7D). As we observed that
CD8+ T cells interacted with stromal fibroblasts and abrogated
chemoresistance induced by fibroblasts (Figures 2 and 6) and
noted that an increased proportion of fibroblasts correlated
with diminished platinum response (Figure 7C) and shorter sur-
vival in patients (Figure 7B), we analyzed the clinical significance
of these findings. We found that the levels of CD8+ T cells were
higher in the tumors of chemosensitive patients as compared
to chemoresistant patients (Figure 7E; Table S6). Thus, the
patients with high SMA who had high stromal CD8+ T cells are
more likely to respond to platinum-based chemotherapy as
compared to patients with high SMA and low CD8+ T cells (Table
S6). Collectively, our results suggest that the density of stromal
fibroblasts and CD8+ T cells affect response to platinum-based
chemotherapy and impacts patient survival.

 DISCUSSION
Effector T cells, fibroblasts, and tumor cells are major cellular
components in the tumor microenvironment. Effector T cell
tumor trafficking and function shape tumor immunotherapy
including PD-L1 blockade and adoptive T cell therapy (Peng
et al., 2015). We have now demonstrated that effector T cells
and the interaction between effector T cells and fibroblasts
play a role in platinum-based chemoresistance and modulate
chemotherapeutic response in patients with ovarian cancer.
Fibroblasts promote tumor progression through multiple
mechanisms, including increased tumor cell proliferation, angio-
genesis, invasion, sustain of stemness, and inhibition of tumor
cell death (Kalluri and Zeisberg, 2006; Loeffler et al., 2006). We
have found that primary cancer-associated fibroblasts confer
resistance to platinum-based treatment in ovarian cancer cells.
It has been reported that fibroblasts mediate carboplatin resis-
tance to pancreatic cancer cell lines (Straussman et al., 2012).
We found that fibroblasts diminish cisplatin accumulation in
ovarian cancer cells by releasing GSH and cysteine. Biological
thiols have been suggested to regulate platinum sensitivity by
decreasing DNA platinum accumulation in cultured tumor cells
(Chen and Kuo, 2010; Kro
¨ ning et al., 2000). GSH and cysteine
are both involved in maintaining intracellular GSH hemostasis
(Lushchak, 2012). Previous studies have suggested that intracel-
lular GSH could react with cisplatin to form a Pt(GS)2 conjugate
and this Pt(GS)2 may be eliminated across the membrane
through the ATP-dependent glutathione S-conjugate export
pump (Ishikawa and Ali-Osman, 1993). Moreover, biological
thiols could directly react with platinum atoms to compete with
DNA-platinum binding in both intracellular and extracellular re-
action systems (Dabrowiak et al., 2002). In our study, we found
that fibroblasts released thiols, elevated intracellular GSH levels,
and reduced platinum DNA accumulation in tumor cells. Thus,

 these findings establish a surprising non-genetic paradigm in
shaping drug resistance: stromal fibroblasts alter thiol meta-
bolism and control chemotherapeutic response in tumor cells.
Clinically, stromal fibroblasts predict platinum-based therapeu-
tic response and patient survival. Moreover, the association be-
tween stromal fibroblasts and patient survival depends upon
platinum response. Thus, we provide mechanistic and clinical
insight into platinum-based resistance.
Intraepithelial (Peng et al., 2015; Sato et al., 2005; Zhao et al.,
2016) and stromal CD8+ T cells correlate with improved survival
in ovarian cancer. Tumor stromal CD8+ T cells may not directly
participate in tumor cell killing activities. We have found that
stromal CD8+ T cells modulate stroma function and in turn regu-
late tumor progression and therapeutic response. For example,
CD8+ T cells can abolish fibroblast-mediated platinum resis-
tance via IFNg. CD8+ T cells alter the metabolism of cystine
and GSH in fibroblasts. CD8+ T cell-derived IFNg activates
GGT and promotes extracellular GSH degradation and dimin-
ishes fibroblast cysteine generation through downregulation of
system xc� cysteine and glutamate antiporter. Furthermore,
IFNg-activated STAT1 binds to specific promoter region of
xCT and rapidly inhibits xCT gene transcription through JAK-
STAT1 signaling in fibroblasts but not in tumor cells. Hence,
our work identifies an unexpected mode of action for effector
T cells and IFNg in the tumor: CD8+ T cells and IFNg selectively
target stromal fibroblasts, shape their thiol metabolism, and
impact tumor chemotherapeutic response. Therefore, effective
immunotherapy may subvert chemoresistance and revitalize tu-
mor sensitivity to chemotherapy. Platinum-based drugs remain
the first line of chemotherapy for ovarian cancer patients. Clinical
responses to PD-L1 and PD-1 blockade are observed in a frac-
tion of patients (Zou et al., 2016). Capitalizing upon the interplay
between chemotherapy and immunotherapy holds promising
clinical potential for ovarian cancer treatment.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Ovarian Cancer Patients, Cancer Tissue Samples, and Cells
Patients diagnosed with HGSOC were recruited for this study. All patients
received standardized platinum-based chemotherapy that was administered
every 3 weeks for six cycles. Platinum resistance was defined as a progression
within 6 months of the platinum therapy. A total of 178 formalin-fixed, paraffin-
embedded ovarian tumor tissue blocks and nine fresh ovarian cancer tissues
were collected for this study (Curiel et al., 2003, 2004; Peng et al., 2015). A tis-
sue microarray (TMA) was constructed, and immunohistochemical staining
was performed as previously described (Cui et al., 2013; Peng et al., 2015).
Single cell suspension was prepared from fresh ovarian cancer tissues and fi-
broblasts were isolated from the adherent cells. CD8+ T cells were isolated
from peripheral blood mononuclear cells using the EasySep Human CD8+
T Cell Isolation Kit (Stemcell) and then stimulated with immobilized anti-CD3
and anti-CD28.
Tumor and Fibroblast Co-culture
For mixed co-culture, fibroblasts and A2780-GFP cells were co-cultured and
Annexin V+ cells were analyzed with GFP gating. For Transwell co-culture, fi-
broblasts were seeded in the plates and tumor cells were in the inserts.
Animal Studies
Female nude mice or NSG mice (6- to 8-week-old) were used for in vivo exper-
iments. Cisplatin or recombinant human IFNg was administered intraperitone-
ally every 3 days for total three treatments or as indicated.
Detection of GSH-Related Metabolites
Fresh medium was analyzed with LC-triple quadrupole mass spectrometer
(Agilent 6490 series) with jet stream electrospray ionization source (Agilent).
Chromatography was carried out on a Waters C18 High Strength Silica T3
column (50 mm 3 2 mm) on Agilent 1200 Series liquid chromatography.
ChIP
ChIP assay was described previously (Peng et al., 2015) (Table S7).
Detection of Cisplatin
Cell pellets or total DNA were digested and platinum concentration was
measured using ICP-HRMS Element 2 (Thermo Scientific).
Radiolabeled Cystine Uptake Assay
Cells were cultured in different conditions in medium containing L-14C-cystine
(0.2 mCi/ml) and lysed in NaOH (100 mM). Radioactivity was measured by a
Beckman liquid scintillation counter.
Statistical Analysis
Data were shown as mean ± SEM or mean ± SD. Statistical analysis was per-
formed using two sample t test, Mann-Whitney test, or one-way or two-way
ANOVA. For all tests, p < 0.05 was considered significant.
