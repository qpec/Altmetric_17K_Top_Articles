utologous transplantation is controversial for older patients with
multiple myeloma. The role of age-adjusted high-dose melpha-
lan and the impact of induction chemotherapy cycles is still
unclear. A total of 434 patients aged 60-70 years were randomly
assigned to 4 cycles of standard anthracycline-based induction
chemotherapy or no induction. For all patients, double autologous trans-
plantation after melphalan 140 mg/m2 (MEL140) was planned. The pri-
mary end point was progression-free survival. Of 420 eligible patients,
85% received a first transplant and 69% completed double transplanta-
tion. Treatment duration was short with a median of 7.7 months with
induction chemotherapy cycles and 4.6 months without induction. On
an intention-to-treat basis, median progression-free survival with induc-
tion chemotherapy cycles (207 patients) was 21.4 months versus 20.0
months with no induction cycles (213 patients) (hazard ratio 1.04, 95%
confidence interval 0.84-1.28; P=0.36). Per protocol,  progression-free
survival was 23.7 months versus 23.0 months (P=0.28). Patients aged  65
years or over  (55%) did not have an inferior outcome. Patients with
low-risk cytogenetics [absence of del17p13, t(4;14) and 1q21 gains]
showed a favorable overall survival and included the patients with sus-
tained first remission. MEL140 was associated with a low rate of severe
mucositis (10%) and treatment-related deaths (1%). Based on  hazard
ratio, the short treatment arm consisting of mobilization chemotherapy
and tandem MEL140 achieved 96% of the progression-free survival,
demonstrating its value as an independent component of therapy in
older patients with multiple myeloma who are considered fit for autol-
ogous transplantation. (clinicaltrials.gov identifier: 02288741)

 Introduction 
High-dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell
transplantation (ASCT) is considered the standard treat-
ment for younger patients with multiple myeloma (MM).1-
3 In older patients, however, its role is less clear and
remains controversial.4-6 As a consequence, many older but
otherwise fit patients are excluded from the procedure.
This may have contributed to a survival disadvantage.7
Concerns about toxicity or an inferior outcome in com-
parison to younger patients continue to inhibit the appli-
cation of high-dose therapy with ASCT in older patients,
although its use has increased considerably in recent
years.8,9 Only limited data are  available as these patients
are under-represented or missing entirely from the large
recent prospective multicenter transplantation trials which
mostly apply an age cut off of 65 years.10-17 The little  infor-
mation there is concerning higher age groups is based on
retrospective single center experience. These mostly
report limited numbers of patients.18-23 Registry data are
lacking details of toxicity and outcome but demonstrate
improvements in overall survival (OS) over the years.8,9 
Melphalan 200 mg/m2 (MEL200) represents the standard
high-dose regimen for the younger patient population.24
The frequent reluctance to apply MEL200 in patients over
the age of 65 years is related to  concerns about potential
higher toxicity. As an alternative to MEL200, an age-
adjusted melphalan dose of 140 mg/m2 (MEL140)25 can be
given in patients over 60 years of age; the intention is to
decrease severe mucositis and other toxicities and thereby
to enable  older patients who are not considered eligible
for MEL200 to proceed to ASCT. Reports show that this
strategy has now become part of current clinical rou-
tine.9,18,20,21,23 The proportion of patients receiving an age-
adjustment of the melphalan dose is steadily increasing
within the higher age groups when considering patients
over the age of 60, over 65 and over 70 years.9,20,21,23 If age-
adjustment were to be applied consistently, many more
older patients could be considered candidates for ASCT. 
Two randomized clinical trials investigated intermedi-
ate-dose melphalan (MEL100) with ASCT in older
patients.5,26 Data from a prospective randomized trial
specifically reporting the efficacy and toxicity of MEL140
in older patients has been lacking; this study aims to pro-
vide this missing information. 
Historically, stem cell therapy is preceded by 3-6 cycles of
induction chemotherapy. This strategy is considered to be
important but since the progression-free survival (PFS)
achieved after ASCT is  achieved from the complete treat-
ment, the contribution of induction chemotherapy alone still
has to be defined. In the prospective phase III trial presented
here, we addressed: 1) the role of conventional induction
chemotherapy cycles prior to high-dose chemotherapy by
randomization between anthracycline-based induction (the
standard therapeutic approach when the trial started) and no
induction cycles; and  2) the real toxicity and efficacy of tan-
dem MEL140 with and without induction chemotherapy in
a large older  patient population.
Methods
Patients and study design
This randomized multicenter trial was planned by the German
Multiple Myeloma Study Group (DSMM) and was conducted at
40 sites. Eligible patients had newly diagnosed stage II or III MM
according to Durie and Salmon and were 60-70 years of age.
Additional criteria for inclusion were an Eastern Cooperative
Oncology Group performance status of 0-2, adequate organ func-
tion, and absence of uncontrolled infection. Enrollment began in
August 2001 and ended in August 2006.
Patients with no previous chemotherapy or a maximum of one
cycle were randomly assigned between conventional induction
chemotherapy cycles and a short course of dexamethasone only
(Figure 1A). The study was performed in accordance with the
Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice guidelines, and
was approved by the local ethics committees at each participating
center. Patients were required to provide written informed consent
before enrollment. The study was registered at clinicaltrials.gov
identifier: 02288741. 
Treatment plan
In the induction arm,  patients received 4 cycles of conventional
anthracycline-dexamethasone-based regimens: vincristine-dox-
orubicin-dexamethasone (VAD),27 idarubicin-dexamethasone
(ID),28 cyclophosphamide-doxorubicin-dexamethasone (CAD).29
In the no induction arm, patients received only 40 mg oral dexam-
ethasone  on days 1-4 and 8-11 for symptom control. For the sub-
sequent stem-cell mobilization, age-adjusted (75% dose) ifos-
famide-epirubicin-etoposide (IEV) with granulocyte-colony stimu-
lating factor (G-CSF) was recommended.30 The target dose for
stem cell collection was 6x106 CD34-positive cells/kg (two trans-
plants and one back-up). The standard dose for each transplanta-
tion was 2x106 CD34-positive cells/kg. High-dose melphalan at a
total dose of 140 mg/m2 (MEL140) was given in two doses of 70
mg/m2 on days -3 and -2. ASCT was performed on day 0. A sec-
ond MEL140 course was planned two months after the first. No
maintenance treatment was given but regular bisphosphonate
administration was recommended.
Sample size and statistical aspects
The primary study end point was PFS calculated from the time
point of randomization. To detect a 10-month advantage in PFS
for the induction arm  [24-34 months, corresponding to a hazard
ratio (HR) of 0.71] with a power of 80% and based on a one-sided
type I error rate of 0.05,  at least 132 patients were required per ran-
domization arm. 
Toxicity of treatment was evaluated using Common Toxicity
Criteria (v.2.0, 1999), the definition of remission followed
European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT)
criteria.31 Except for the primary end point, all analyses were
descriptive or explorative in nature, providing two-sided P-values
without referring to a specified error level. No adjustments were
made for multiple testing. Proportions were eventually compared
using Fisher's exact or χ² test. All time-to-event end points were
calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method. Survival curves were
compared using the log-rank test. HR with confidence intervals
were derived from Cox models.
Results
Patients
Figure 1 shows the study design and the consort dia-
gram. A total of 434 patients were enrolled into the study
protocol and were randomized. Fourteen patients (3%)
were excluded from analysis. Accordingly, 420 patients
could be analyzed with respect to the primary end point:
PFS. The median follow-up period was 5.2 years (range 0-
10.1 years). Details of consecutive treatment steps were

 documented in 416 patients. Baseline characteristics of
patients are shown in Table 1.
Induction chemotherapy
In the induction arm (n=207 patients), 98% received one
of the recommended induction regimens (idarubicin-dex-
amethasone 67%, vincristine-doxorubicin-dexametha-
sone 25%, cyclophosphamide-doxorubicin-dexametha-
sone 6%), 2% received  dexamethasone alone.  A median
of 4 cycles (range 1-7 cycles) were given for a median of
3.9 months (range 0.3-12.3 months). In the no induction
arm,  the 2 cycles of   4x40 mg dexamethasone were given
for a median of 0.7 months (range 0-5.7 months) before
stem cell mobilization was initiated.
Stem-cell mobilization and ASCT
A total of 385 patients (92%) were treated with stem
cell mobilization chemotherapy:  ifosfamide-epirubicin-
etoposide  in 89%,  cyclophosphamide-doxorubicin-dex-
amethasone in 5%, cyclophosphamide in 4%, cyclophos-

 phamide-etoposide in 1%,  ifosfamide in 1%. Stem cells
were collected   in 376 patients. The recommended target
value (≥6x106 CD34+ cells/kg) and the required dose for a
double transplantation (≥4x106 CD34+ cells/kg) were
achieved in 80% and 90% of patients, respectively. A total
of 357 patients (85%) then went on to receive at least one
transplant and 289 patients (69%) completed a double
transplant. The main reasons for drop-out in the 68
patients (16%) who did not receive the second transplant
were: progression of disease (21%), toxicity (22%), death
(7%), patient refusal  (18%), insufficient stem cell collec-
tion (7%).
Toxicity, deaths and second primary malignancies 
The major grade III/IV non-hematologic toxicities were
infection and mucositis (Table 2). Deaths up to 100 days
from the last treatment occurred in 25 patients (6.0%) and
death was due to: disease progression  in 5 patients
(1.2%), toxicity (infection, sepsis, renal failure, cardiac)  in
20 patients (4.8%). In 20 of 25 cases, death occurred
before the first MEL140. Transplant-related mortality
(TRM) was very low:  1.4% after the first MEL140 and,
notably, 0% following the second MEL140. Some cases of
grade III/IV mucositis were seen during induction
chemotherapy cycles (4%), but none were observed dur-
ing the short dexamethasone pre-phase. Comparison of
the induction  and the no induction arms showed: 2% 
versus 6% grade III/IV mucositis after mobilization, 11%
versus 16% after the first MEL140 course, 5% versus 7%
for the second MEL140, respectively. Moderate rates of
grade III/IV infections occurred during induction
chemotherapy cycles or the dexamethasone pre-phase
(17% vs. 4%), after mobilization (17% vs. 30%), and at a
higher frequency after the first MEL140 (35% vs. 44%)
and second MEL140 (38% vs. 34%). A second primary
malignancy was reported (2 solid tumors, 2 acute myeloid
leukemias) in 4  of 420 patients (1%).
Response rates
Response rates reflected differences in treatment and
treatment progress between patients in the two arms
(Table 3). There was an initial lag in response rate in the
no induction arm. However, this recovered in the follow-
ing treatment steps, and after the second MEL140
response rates were similar in the two arms.
Long-term outcomes after randomization
Median PFS for patients in the induction arm was 21.4
months compared to 20.0 months for patients in the no
induction arm [hazard ratio (HR) for progression or death
1.04, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.84-1.28; P=0.36]
(Figure 2A). Therefore, based on this HR, 96% of the
duration of PFS was already achieved by ASCT alone;
induction chemotherapy cycles contributed only 4%.
Treatment duration was short with a median of 7.7
months in patients in the induction arm and a median of
4.6 months in patients in the no induction arm. For dou-
ble transplant recipients (per protocol), median PFS was
23.7 months for patients in the induction arm compared
to 23.0 months for patients in the no induction arm
(P=0.28) (Figure 2B). In the intention-to-treat analysis,
median OS for patients in the induction arm was 53.4
months compared to 55.9 months for patients in the no
induction arm (HR for death 1.01, 95%CI: 0.77-1.32;
P=0.95). Per protocol (double transplants), the median OS
for patients in the induction arm was 68.5 months com-
pared to 64.4 for patients in the no induction arm
(P=0.98). A subgroup of 27 patients (6.4%) from both
arms were survivors in first remission at five years.
Among these 27 patients, characterized by the presence
of low-risk cytogenetics (100%), 96% received MEL140,
85% received a double transplant, and 70% were not in
ISS stage III. In 16 of these patients, no relapses were seen
beyond five years. 
Treatment effects according to age subgroups
The discontinuation rate before the first high-dose mel-
phalan course was  higher for  patients aged 65-70 years
(18%) than for those aged 60-64 years (9%). The drop-out
rate after the first MEL140 was similar for the younger
(18%) and the older (17%) patients. More patients aged
60-64 years than aged 65-70 years completed tandem
MEL140 (73% vs. 65%). Deaths within 100 days from the
last treatment were more frequent during the induction
phase in patients aged 65-70 years (6.1% vs. 3.1%), but
were similar in both age groups following the first trans-
plant (1.6% vs. 1.1%) and did not occur in either age

 group after the second transplant. On the intention-to-
treat basis, median PFS in younger versus older patients
(19.5 and 22.1 months; P=0.23) and median OS (56.3  and
53.1 months; P=0.58) were similar (Figure 3A).
Cytogenetic risk and outcome
Of the 210 evaluated patients, 108 patients (51%) ful-
filled the IMWG32,33 low-risk cytogenetics criteria: absence
of translocation (4;14), deletion 17p13,  amplification of
1q21.2) (Table 1). High-risk cytogenetics [presence of
translocation (4;14) and/or deletion 17p13] were found in
21%, intermediate-risk cytogenetics [presence of amplifi-
cation of 1q21.2, absence of translocation (4;14) and dele-
tion (17p13)] were present in 28% of cases. A highly sig-
nificant difference between low-risk and high-risk cytoge-
netics was seen for PFS (median 23.5 vs. 14.9 months;
P<0.0001) and OS (median 74.7 vs. 32.9 months;
P<0.0001) (Figure 3B). The patients with low-risk cytoge-
netics who completed double transplantation (78%) had
an excellent outcome (median PFS 26.7 months and medi-
an OS 87.4 months). Patients still alive in sustained first
remission beyond five years were considered to be in the
low-risk cytogenetics group.
Discussion 
Our trial abandoned induction chemotherapy cycles
before ASCT in one arm of the study in order to test the
relationship between induction chemotherapy and ASCT,
and did not use consolidation or maintenance therapy.
This must be considered when comparing the outcome of
our trial to others  which  applied the common strategy of
incorporating all available drugs into treatment phases
before and after ASCT with the aim of achieving  a maxi-
mum duration of PFS after first-line treatment in MM
patients. Unexpectedly, we found that a large part of the
anti-tumor effect (96%) was achieved with high-dose
chemotherapy and ASCT alone, and that the  4 cycles of
anthracycline-based induction chemotherapy only made a
small contribution. By 3-4 months of anthracycline-based
induction therapy, the PFS was improved by only two
months. Based on the HR of the comparison between the
two arms, such induction chemotherapy cycles achieved
only 4% of the PFS. Anthracycline-based induction
chemotherapy was the standard approach when our trial
started but has since been replaced by induction regimens
incorporating novel agents. In this respect, both arms of

 our trial may be regarded as a 'baseline' from which the
achievements of novel agent-based induction therapy can
be evaluated. The current use of bortezomib-based induc-
tion regimens,13,11,15,34-36 were found to increase the PFS over
the typical anthracycline-based regimen VAD13,15 by
approximately six months. Despite this improvement, the
estimated impact of such induction therapy on the overall
PFS appears to be limited when we consider our 'baseline'
results and those from other trials demonstrating a high
efficacy of post-transplant treatments with novel
agents.10,12,14 Our study is the first prospective randomized
trial to characterize the 'real'  toxicity and efficacy of
MEL140 with ASCT in older MM patients. The results
highlight an independent role for ASCT in older patients.
MEL140 was well-tolerated. The rate of severe mucositis
was approximately 10%, TRM approximately 1%. It
should be emphasized that following the treatment pause
after the first MEL140, the non-hematologic toxicity of the
second MEL140 appeared to be a little lower compared to
the first MEL140  and the TRM was 0%.  Importantly,
the long-term outcome identified a subgroup of patients
who did not relapse after MEL140 even over a number of
years. This may indicate some curative potential with age-
adjusted high-dose melphalan. For more than 200 patients
aged 65-70 years, the outcome was at least as good com-
pared to the younger patients in this study, demonstrating
that an age cut off at 65 years for MEL140 was not rele-
vant. The long-term outcome for the tandem MEL140
component in conjunction with the large number of
patients treated may serve as a point of reference for
future trials. Geriatric assessment and comorbidity scores
will be helpful to encourage autologous transplantation in
many MM older patients.37,38 The low rate of second pri-
mary malignancies following tandem MEL140 in compar-
ison to that in the published literature39 is noteworthy and
could be related to the limited first-line treatment in the
study population.
Due to the significant efforts of a central laboratory, we
can present up-to-date cytogenetic data for around 200
patients. Many publications define high-risk versus stan-

 dard-risk groups but very few reports indicate a low-risk
group as defined by the IMWG.33,34 This requires investiga-
tion of 1q21 gains together with analysis of translocation
(4;14) and deletion 17p. We found that 50% of the MM
patients of this age group who had a low-risk cytogenetic
profile showed excellent survival rates with front-line age-
adjusted high-dose melphalan. Importantly, the patients
with low-risk cytogenetics included those with sustained
unmaintained first remission, and some of these could be
considered 'cured'. Recently, treatment with novel agents
plus ASCT has been found to be more effective than novel
agents plus conventional chemotherapy in patients up to
65 years of age.14,16,17 Similar  randomized clinical trials are
also needed in the older patient population and treatment
should be based on  tandem MEL140. 
Another important aspect to consider is that the concept
of age-adjusted high-dose melphalan includes double
transplantation, which compensates the dose reduction of
single melphalan. The tandem MEL100 regimen divided
the standard MEL200 dose in two parts and enabled older
patients to proceed to ASCT with reduced toxicity.5,26,40 A
tandem application of MEL200 in older patients, however,
was found to decrease steeply with higher age due to the
well-known  risks associated with these patients.22 In con-
trast, in our trial, a rapid improvement in performance sta-
tus post transplant allowed the second MEL140 course to
be given after two months in approximately 80% of
patients. Therefore, as far as feasibility is concerned, tan-
dem MEL140 (cumulative melphalan dose 280 mg/m2)
represents an alternative to single MEL200 (200 mg/m2) in
the older patient population. Such a comparison should be
investigated in a prospective randomized trial for patients
aged 60-70 years.
In fact, our trial shows that the treatment arm consisting
of stem-cell mobilization chemotherapy followed by tan-
dem MEL140 with ASCT, despite its short treatment time
of 4-5 months, is extremely effective, with a PFS of 20-23
months. Current non-transplant regimens used in this age
group, such as VMP41 or MPT42 or MPR43 or Rd,44 provide
similar PFS rates (median 22, 20, 14 and 21 months,
respectively) but are associated with the development of
neuropathy or thrombosis and thromboembolism and
require a prolonged treatment time that often does exceed
one year. On the other hand, our trial demonstrates that
age-adjusted high-dose therapy is not necessarily 'aggres-
sive', nor is this 'aggressiveness' observed in all patients.
Older fit patients may, therefore, benefit from an age-
adjusted transplant program that would allow longer
unmaintained remissions following transplantation during
which patients can enjoy freedom-from-therapy. When
lenalidomide is continued as maintenance therapy in the
MPRR43 or continues Rd44 regimens, the PFS can be extend-
ed. Similarly, lenalidomide maintenance can also be used
after MEL140.10,12,14,40 The preference for MEL140 or
MEL200 in subgroups of older patients is beyond the
scope of the present paper as  this has been discussed
extensively in  previous publications. The known argu-
ments center around the specific features of MEL200
(higher toxicity, potentially higher efficacy, single trans-
plantation, upper age limit around 70 years) versus
MEL140 (lower toxicity, potentially lower efficacy, tan-
dem transplantation possible, upper age limit around 75
years). Obviously, any valid recommendation  can only be
made on the basis of   the availability of results from
prospective randomized trials in specific age groups
which, however, are completely lacking. Therefore, for
the moment, MEL140 and MEL200 represent complemen-
tary rather than competing options for older patients. In
conclusion, short-term tandem MEL140 with ASCT can
lead to long-lasting unmaintained remission, and should
be considered an independent component of myeloma
therapy. A sustained first remission is associated with
low-risk cytogenetics present  in approximately 50% of
patients.
