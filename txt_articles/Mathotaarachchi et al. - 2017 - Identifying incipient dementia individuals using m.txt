Abstract: Identifying individuals destined to develop Alzheimer’s dementia within time frames 
acceptable for clinical trials constitutes an important challenge to design studies to test emerging 
disease-modifying therapies. Although amyloid-β protein is the core pathological feature of 
Alzheimer’s disease, biomarkers of neuronal degeneration are the only ones believed to provide 
satisfactory predictions of clinical progression within short time frames. Here, we propose a 
machine learning based probabilistic method designed to assess the progression to dementia 
within 24 months, based on the regional information from a single amyloid Positron Emission 
Tomography scan. Importantly, the proposed method was designed to overcome the inherent 
adverse imbalance proportions between stable and progressive mild cognitive impairment 
individuals within a short observation period. The novel algorithm obtained an accuracy of 84%, 
and an under receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.91 outperforming existing algorithms 
using the same biomarker measures and previous studies using multiple biomarker modalities. 
With its high accuracy, this algorithm has immediate applications for population enrichment in 
clinical trials designed to test disease modifying-therapies aiming to mitigate the progression to 
Alzheimer’s disease dementia.

Introduction 
Alzheimer’s Disease is the most common form of dementia, accounting for approximately 60-
80% of the cases with alarming economic and social costs (Pouryamout et al., 2012). It is well 
understood that Alzheimer’s disease pathophysiology follows a gradual course with pathologies 
developing over decades prior to symptom onset (Braak and Braak, 1991; Mosconi et al., 2007). 
Thus, there is an increased interest to advance the disease modifying clinical trials to the pre-
dementia stages of Alzheimer’s disease given the better chances of obtaining tangible disease 
modifying effects. This has been encouraged by the identification of biomarkers to detect the 
pathological signatures at the early stages of the disease (Buerger et al., 2006; Fagan et al., 2006; 
McEvoy and Brewer, 2010; Morris et al., 2009). However, given the high prevalence of 
cognitively normal elderly individuals carrying the Alzheimer’s disease pathophysiology, 
accurately identifying individuals who are in the early stages of Alzheimer’s disease has been a 
significant challenge. Thus, the development of effective clinical trials has been severely 
hampered by not being able to recruit individuals who have higher likelihood of developing 
Alzheimer’s disease (Holland et al., 2012) within a time period acceptable to conduct a study.  
Identification of effective biomarkers signatures to determine the progression of dementia has 
been a significant challenge to accurately predict the short-term clinical progression. It is 
believed that the biomarkers of neurodegeneration such as glucose metabolism and brain atrophy 
would be the most effective, as the other pathological markers such as brain amyloid-β 
deposition and formation of hyper-phosphorylated tau tangles occur years or decades prior to the 
symptom onset (Clifford R. Jack et al., 2010; Jack et al., 2013). However, numerous studies 
based on neurodegenerative biomarkers have indicated a decrease in ability to predict the clinical 
progression when the observation time is more than 18 months. Given that the accumulation of 
Aβ in the brain is a hallmark characteristic of Alzheimer’s disease, amyloid-based biomarkers 
can be assumed to provide a better sensitivity to Alzheimer’s disease pathology over a longer 
observation period (Trzepacz et al., 2014).  
Studies conducted to evaluate the utility of amyloid biomarkers have used the cerebrospinal fluid 
(CSF) Aβ measurements due to the relatively higher availability compared to amyloid PET 
biomarkers. These studies have often combined other CSF measurements such as tau and p-tau 
concentrations and MRI biomarkers (Apostolova et al., 2014; Davatzikos et al., 2011; Hall et al., 
2015; Yang et al., 2012; Young et al., 2012) to accommodate for the limited dimensionality 
offered by the CSF measurements. However, the possibility to regionally assess Alzheimer’s 
disease pathophysiology and the increased availability of amyloid PET images in large-scale 
aging studies have enabled the evaluation of this imaging biomarker as a diagnostic tool.  
As the earliest detectable clinical stage of the trajectory towards dementia, mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI) provides an attractive point of entry to disease modifying interventions 
(Markesbery, 2010). However, not all MCI individuals carry Alzheimer’s disease 
pathophysiology and progress to Alzheimer’s disease in an optimal time frame for clinical trial. 
Thus, identification of biomarker signatures of MCI individuals on the verge of progression to

dementia and predicting the likelihood of conversion, has immediate application in disease 
modifying clinical trials by including those individuals with high likelihood to progress. This 
will increase the statistical power of the clinical trial by reducing false positives and would 
directly impact the associated costs. Furthermore, these information, would also provide 
important prognostic information for the patients and their families to plan and manage treatment 
and care (Gelosa and Brooks, 2012).  
The prediction of the clinical progression to dementia from MCI phase constitutes a challenge 
due to the considerably lower number of progressive MCI (pMCI) individuals compared to the 
stable MCI (sMCI) individuals, invariably creating imbalanced classes (pMCI, sMCI). In a 
classification study, if the number of samples from a class (sMCI) greatly outnumbers the other 
classes (pMCI), the classifier tends to favor the overrepresented majority class (sMCI) by 
ignoring incorrect prediction in the minority class (pMCI). This constitutes a challenge known as 
the “class imbalance problem” and leads to decreased sensitivity of the prediction, which has 
been currently overlooked in Alzheimer’s disease research. While there are a number of 
techniques developed to address this challenge, such as class weight adjusting, over sampling the 
minority class and under sampling the majority class (Japkowicz and Stephen, 2002), the latter is 
identified to perform the best (Seiffert et al., 2010, 2008). Random Under Sampling (RUS) is a 
method of under sampling, which will train each of its base learners with the full minority class 
and a randomly under sampled majority class. By doing this, each base learner is trained with a 
balanced set of samples from both pMCI and sMCI classes, removing the bias towards any 
particular class.  
Amyloid PET images used in the study are [18F]Florbetapir PET scans acquired from the 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). The study cohort presented a pMCI rate of 
15.75%, similar to the rates presented by other cohort studies and community studies (Mitchell 
and Shiri-Feshki, 2009). This presents the aforementioned class imbalanced challenge. Current 
study utilizes RUS, to overcome this challenge. The novel prediction algorithm is presented as 
Random Under Sampled Random Forest (RUSRF) and is used to evaluate the utility of amyloid 
PET as a diagnostic tool.  
The present study aims to evaluate the utility of amyloid PET imaging as an early detection tool 
for individuals in the Alzheimer’s disease pathway. Specifically, we aim to predict if an MCI 
individual will progress to Alzheimer’s disease or remain MCI within a time period of 24 months 
based on the amyloid PET measurements at baseline.  We further believe that the proposed 
technique can be used to complement the multibiomarker enrichment strategies for clinical trials 
(Wolz et al., 2016).  
This novel technique capitalizes on an optimized feature extraction method for amyloid PET, and 
a method for addressing the class imbalance problem in the context of a random forest machine 
learning classifier (Breiman, 2001). We further compare the performance of RUSRF with other 
widely used prediction algorithms such as the SVM, L1 and L2 regularized logistic regression, 
and Random Forest. We believe that the novel RUSRF algorithm will outperform these widely-

Materials and Methods 
Subjects and data acquisition 
Data used in the preparation of this article were obtained from the ADNI database. ADNI was 
launched in 2003 as a public-private partnership, led by Principal Investigator Michael W. 
Weiner, MD. The primary goal of ADNI has been to test whether serial magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), other biological markers, and clinical and 
neuropsychological assessment can be combined to measure the progression of mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI) and early Alzheimer’s disease (Alzheimer’s disease). 
We selected 273 ADNI-GO/2 participants meeting the criteria for single-domain or multi-
domain amnestic MCI and acquired their [18F]Florbetapir PET, demographic, APOE4 genotype 
information and the clinical diagnosis with the corresponding diagnosis information for the 
subsequent 24-month follow-up visit (mean follow-up time: 24.37 months, standard deviation: 
1.51 months). For PET image processing purposes, the matching T1-weighted MRI images were 
also obtained. The eligibility criteria of MCI were participants with mini-mental state 
examination (MMSE) score equal to or greater than 24, a clinical dementia rating of 0.5, 
subjective and objective memory loss, normal activities of daily living, and the absence of other 
neuropsychiatric disorders including Alzheimer’s disease (Petersen, 2003).  
The subjects were categorized into 2 groups, stable MCI (sMCI) and progressive MCI (pMCI), 
based on the diagnosis on their follow-up visit. If a subject was diagnosed to be Alzheimer’s 
disease in the follow-up visit, that subject was categorized as pMCI, and if the subject remained 
MCI at the 24-month follow-up visit, he or she was categorized as sMCI. Out of the 273 
individuals used in the study, only 43 (15.75%) individuals were diagnosed as probable 
Alzheimer’s disease in their follow-up visit and were categorized as pMCI. Demographical 
information of the sample of individuals used in the study is presented in Table 1.   
Image processing 
The acquired T1-weighted MRI images were processed using the CIVET image processing 
pipeline (Ad-Dab’bagh et al., 2006; Zijdenbos et al., 2002), where the images underwent non-
uniformity correction (Sled et al., 1998), brain masking (Smith, 2002), linear and nonlinear 
registration to the ICBM 152 Template (Fonov et al., 2009; Mazziotta et al., 1995) using the 
ANIMAL (Collins et al., 1995; Collins and Evans, 1997; Robbins et al., 2004) image registration 
algorithm. Downloaded [18F]Florbetapir PET images were already pre-processed to perform 
motion correction and to acquire uniform spatial resolution according to the steps outlined in 
(Online: http://adni.loni.usc.edu/methods/pet-analysis/pre-processing/, Accessed: 28-03-2016). 
The PET images were then registered to the subjects’ own T1 weighted MRI images and were 
spatial normalized to the ICBM 152 template. They were then normalized for the regional 
intensities from the cerebellum grey matter and the global white matter to generate 
[18F]Florbetapir PET SUVR images.

Two sets of subjects were generated from the total set of individuals as training set (STrain) and 
testing set (STest) (Table 1). The training set was used in the feature selection step and training the 
machine learning algorithm, while the testing set was used solely to evaluate the performance of 
the trained machine learning algorithm. Since the testing set is not used in the feature selection 
step or in training, we void any bias or adverse effect from “double dipping” in the prediction of 
progression to Alzheimer’s disease. The ratio between the sMCI and pMCI individuals was 
preserved in both the training set and the testing set. 
Feature selection 
To identify the brain regions from where the PET SUVR values are read as features for the 
predictors, we employed a voxel-wise logistic regression analysis. For each brain voxel, the 
following logistic function was solved: 
 
where 
= probability of progressing to Alzheimer’s disease in 24 months. Then, for each voxel, 
the scaled increase in odds (scaled odds ratio) for a one standard deviation (
) increase in 
[18F]Florbetapir PET SUVR was calculated as follows: 
 
Anatomically significant brain regions with OR������ > 1.5 were selected based upon expert 
opinion, and PET SUVR intensities from these regions were extracted as the mean of a 3x3x3 
cluster of voxels. The above regional PET SUVR intensities along with age, gender, and APOE4 
genotype status were fed into the predictors as features. 
Prediction 
Prediction was performed using the novel algorithm, Random Under-Sampled Random Forest 
(RUSRF), based on the Random Forest classifier (Breiman, 2001). The novel algorithm uses 
sampling techniques to train multiple Random Forest predictors to calculate the final prediction. 
The primary goal of the present application is to predict progression to Alzheimer’s disease, 
however, the population contains only 15.71% pMCI individuals. This constitutes a class 
imbalance problem with a majority sMCI class. In this case, the predictors tend to be biased to 
predict the majority class (sMCI) and to ignore the misclassification in the minority class (pMCI) 
(Yen and Lee, 2009). To overcome this, the novel algorithm utilizes a data sampling technique 
named “random under-sampling”, where the majority class is randomly sampled to create a 
pseudo training set with equal proportions in all the classes. This technique is closely related to 
the RUSBoost technique (Seiffert et al., 2008), however, the base classifier used in the present 
study is Random Forest, and the iterative boosting method is not employed as the Random Forest 
classifier uses feature bagging to achieve independence and randomness.

In summary, RUSRF algorithm will train � number of Random Forest predictors with individual 
pseudo training sets with equal class distributions. The number of minority class samples (��) 
in a pseudo training set is equal to the total number of minority class samples in the original 
training set. Thus, all � Random Forest predictors are trained for all the minority class instances. 
The number of majority class samples are calculated to be a fraction (�) higher than the number 
of samples in the minority class. The final probability prediction is calculated as the mean 
probability across all the � Random Forests, and the final prediction is calculated as the final 
probability prediction greater than 0.5.  
The implementation of the RUSRF algorithm was done in python programming language using 
the Random Forest implementation in the scikit-learn library (Online: http://scikit-
learn.org/stable/, Accessed: 28-04-2016). 
Performance evaluation and comparison 
RUSRF algorithm has two primary parameters to be optimized based on the application, which 
are the number of Random Forest predictors and the number of decision trees in each of the 
Random Forest predictor. To estimate the best combination of these two parameters, we 
employed a nested cross validation technique (Huttunen et al., 2012; Moradi et al., 2015). The 
outer cross validation step divided the training set (������) in to 10 subsets (������
�
; � = 1 … 10) 
preserving the class ratios of the original population (stratified cross validation). In each training 
step �, ������
�
 was subdivided (using stratified cross validation) into 10 subsets (������
��
; � =
1 … 10), and was passed to RUSRF algorithm with a tuple of parameters (number of Random 
Forest predictors, number of trees in each predictor) selected from a grid of parameter 
combinations for training. The best set of parameters was selected based on the AUC from the 
internal 10-fold cross validation. The performance of the predictor was then evaluated based on 
the AUC, accuracy (number of correct classifications divided by the total number of samples (in 
�����)), F1 score (harmonic mean of precision and recall), sensitivity (number of correctly 
classified pMCI subjects divided by the total pMCI subjects), and specificity (number of 
correctly classified sMCI subjects divided by the total sMCI subjects) for the original test set 
(�����). These values were calculated based on the predictions of each outer cross validation step 
�, on the testing set (�����). By evaluating the performance based on the original test set (�����), 
we recorded the true generalization ability of the RUSRF predictor.  
To examine the performance gain from the RUSRF predictor, we trained four other widely used 
classifiers such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), logistic regression with L1 regularization, 
logistic regression with L2 regularization, and Random Forest (Breiman, 2001) using the same 
set of features and compared with the performance of RUSRF. Evaluating the optimum 
parameters and the performance for these widely-used classifiers were also done using a nested 
cross validation as described above. McNemar’s �� test was performed to compare each of the 
classifiers against random predictors. The random predictors were developed by training each of 
the classification algorithms with a randomly permuted training set to disrupt the relationships

between the class labels and input features. Furthermore, a paired t-test was performed to 
compare AUC and F1 scores of the RUSRF predictor against the other four predictors, while 
McNemar’s �� test was used to compare the sensitivity and specificity. However, the overall 
accuracy of each predictor was not used as a measure of comparison because it can misinterpret 
the performance when the sample has imbalanced class probabilities. The resulting p values were 
Bonferroni adjusted to correct for multiple comparisons. The classification analysis was carried 
out in python programming language using the scikit-learn library, and the statistical analysis 
was carried out using the R programming language.  
In a binary classification, Random Forest algorithm performs implicit feature selection based on 
the parameter called “Gini importance” (Breiman, 2001), which is calculated as the accumulated 
decrease in “Gini impurity �(�)” . This is defined as; �(�) =  1 − ��
� − ��
�. Here �� = 
��
� , which 
is the fraction of the �� samples from class � = �0, 1� out of the total n samples at a node � in a 
binary decision tree in Random Forest. The decrease in Gini impurity results from splitting the 
node by a threshold �� on variable �, and sending the samples to two sub nodes �� and �� is 
calculated as ∆ �(�) =  �(�) − ���(��) − ���(��), where �� = 
��
� and �� = 
��
� , the relative sample 
fractions at nodes �� and ��. The optimum split is then determined, which results in the maximum 
decrease in Gini impurity at node �. The accumulation of these decreases in Gini impurity for all 
nodes � in all trees � in the Forest, is known as the Gini importance (��) for variable �. 
 
This measure indicates how often a variable is used for a split and how large its discriminative 
power is in the classification study. In the RUSRF algorithm, the mean of this measure across all 
the Random Forests, �, is used as the measure of feature importance for variable �.

Results  
Demographic information of the individuals included in this study is summarized in Table 1. Out 
of the 273 individuals, 43 (15.75%) were diagnosed with probable Alzheimer’s disease after the 
24-month follow-up and were categorized as pMCI.  
Voxel wise logistic regression analysis resulted in a scaled odds ratio map with the highest 
values in the Orbitofrontal Cortex, Mid Frontal Cortex, Mid Temporal Cortex, Temporal 
Occipital Junction, Posterior Cingulate Cortex, Angular Gyrus, Precuneus, Putamen, and the 
Nucleus Accumbens (Figure 2). Standard Uptake Value Ratio (SUVR) values from bilateral 
brain regions were extracted as described above and subsequently averaged to be used as 
regional SUVRs. These regional SUVR values were then used as features on the predictors 
together with age, gender, and APOE4 gene status.  
Predictive performances from the five predictors are shown in Table 2. The RUSRF predictor 
has the highest predictive performance for both stable MCI and progressive MCI individuals 
based on the average area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) (0.906 (+/- 
0.009)) and F1 score (0.583 (+/- 0.044)). The RUSRF AUC score is significantly different from 
both the Support Vector Machine (SVM) and L2 logistic regression at p<0.0025 and from 
Random Forest at p<0.0125. Furthermore, the RUSRF F1 score is significantly different from 
SVM at p<0.0025 and from L2 logistic regression at p<0.0125. The sensitivity of the RUSRF 
predictor only differed from the SVM predictor at p<0.025. The RUSRF specificity was different 
from L2 logistic regression at p<0.0125 and from SVM, L1 logistic regression, and Random 
Forest at p<0.025. The p value thresholds used here for statistical significance were Bonferroni 
adjusted for multiple comparisons.  
According to McNemar’s �� test (Table 3), only the RUSRF predictor showed a statistically 
significant difference with the random predictor at p<0.01. Both regularized logistic regression 
predictors were significantly different at p<0.1. However, the Random Forest predictor and the 
SVM predictor were not significantly different from the random predictor. The �� statistic for 
the SVM predictor cannot be calculated as the output from the predictions from both SVM and 
the random predictor were identical. The SVM prediction for each test case, which was 
calculated as the mean of the prediction from all 10 iterations was 0. This, resulted in an 
exaggerated accuracy of 84.15% (all true 0 cases correctly predicted – specificity of 100%).  
Figure 3a shows the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves for the four predictors with 
their respective AUC values. The ROC curve for the novel RUSRF predictor dominated the 
other curves with an area of 0.91, followed by the L1 logistic predictor, Random Forest 
predictor, and the L2 logistic predictor. The AUC < 0.5 for the SVM predictor (Table 2) 
indicated that the SVM predictor is a predictor for the stable MCI class but not for the 
progressive MCI class.  
The relative feature importance from the novel RUSRF predictor is shown in Figure 3b. The 
most important features indicated the brain regions with the highest contribution to predict the

pMCI class. Aβ accumulations measured by [18F]Florbetapir PET SUVR in the Temporal 
Occipital Junction, Mid Temporal Cortex, Mid Frontal Cortex , and Precuneus were the most 
important features followed by the accumulation in other brain regions and age, gender, and 
APOE4 gene status. The feature importance from the Random Forest classifier indicated the 
same four regions to be the most important features (Supplementary Table 1).

Discussion  
We have presented a novel algorithm for predicting the progression from MCI to Alzheimer’s 
disease dementia using baseline amyloid PET measurements. The novel RUSRF algorithm uses 
the Random Forest classifier as its base classifier along with advanced data sampling techniques 
to overcome inherent problems of the data sample to improve the prediction accuracy. This 
algorithm was shown to provide advantages as demonstrated by higher AUC and F1 score when 
compared to the other widely used prediction algorithms such as SVM, regularized logistic 
regression, and Random Forest. Furthermore, our preliminary data suggested, that this algorithm 
could perform comparably to the methods employed using MRI, FDG PET, CSF biomarkers and 
their combinations (Table 3). It is important to emphasize that the evaluation of the prediction 
algorithms, employed a completely independent testing sample, which was never used in training 
or feature selection steps. This method of evaluation resembles expected outcomes in an 
application (clinical and research) environment, which can be considered encouraging to be used 
for early diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease.  
Using the RUSRF algorithm, we obtained AUC and F1 scores of 0.906 (0.009) and 0.583 
(0.044), respectively, for the independent testing set. Generally, the progression to Alzheimer’s 
disease dementia of a MCI population within 24 months lies around 16.2% (Mitchell and Shiri-
Feshki, 2009). Thus, in a prediction study, the pMCI class (the subset of individuals progressing 
to Alzheimer’s disease) is expected to lie close to the same proportion, creating imbalanced 
classes. If the methods to overcome this challenge is not involved, the prediction algorithm will 
ignore the errors in the minority class (Japkowicz and Stephen, 2002). This can result in 
exaggerated accuracies, as the predictor can be biased towards the majority class, but it can also 
result in lower sensitivity for the minority class. In the present study, pMCI individuals were 
only 15.75% of the sample. Therefore, comparing the prediction accuracy based on the overall 
accuracy will lead to incorrect conclusions due to the adverse bias towards the majority class 
(sMCI). In other words, a classifier predicting sMCI, regardless of the input features, will result 
in 84.25% overall accuracy as there will only be 15.75% incorrect predictions (pMCI individuals 
predicted as sMCI; 0% accuracy in pMCI class). To this regard, we have excluded the overall 
accuracy as a measure to compare predictors used in this study; however, we used McNemar’s 
�� test to compare the sensitivity and the specificity. It is important to mention that the majority 
of studies conducted to predict the progression of Alzheimer’s disease dementia from MCI have 
not considered whether their samples represent the imbalanced proportions of the population (see 
Table 3). This can lead to inconsistent results when the studies are used in a clinical setting as the 
models have been trained and tested on a heightened representation of the pMCI population. 
Given that the population used in the present study is a closer representation of the MCI 
population, the results of the study can be considered transferable to clinical use in early 
diagnosis.

against a random predictor. The random predictor was created by training each of the algorithms 
(RUSRF, SVM, regularized logistic regression, and Random Forest) with a randomly permuted 
set of features derived from the original training set. By doing this, the relationship between the 
features and the classes are completely disrupted, and the predictor is trained to learn a random 
pattern. A statistically significant difference from a random predictor was only observed in the 
RUSRF predictor at p < 0.01, indicating that the novel algorithm was able to learn the 
classification patterns with a significant difference to a randomly trained classifier. Both 
regularized logistic regression algorithms showed differences at p < 0.1, indicating a trend. This 
may be due to the limited number of samples used in the testing set and the skewed proportions 
of sMCI and pMCI individuals. However, neither the Random Forest predictor nor the SVM 
predictor showed a significant difference from a random predictor, indicating their failure to 
learn the prediction relationships from the training set.  
McNemar’s �� test and paired t-test were used to compare the performance of the RUSRF 
algorithm with other prediction algorithms. The AUC score can be considered a single metric for 
classifier performance when dealing with highly unequal sample sizes (Eskildsen et al., 2013). 
The RUSRF algorithm achieved the highest AUC score and was significantly different to both 
SVM and L2 logistic regression at p < 0.0025 and to Random Forest at p < 0.0125. Although the 
AUC of RUSRF was nominally higher than the AUC of L1 logistic regression, it was not 
significantly different. However, the standard deviation of the AUC in L1 logistic regression was 
considerably greater than that of RUSRF. This indicates that the performance of the L1 logistic 
regression is more sensitive to the noise presented in the input features (Frome et al., 2007; Fu et 
al., 2006), which can lead to inconsistent results in a clinical setting when used in early 
diagnosis. We also used the F1 score to compare the predictor performance as it considers both 
the precision and recall to construct the metric. The RUSRF predictor achieved the highest F1 
score and was significantly different from SVM at p < 0.0025 and from L2 logistic regression at 
p < 0.0125. The F1 score of RUSRF was nominally higher compared to both L1 logistic 
regression and Random Forest but was not significant. However, in the case of Random Forest, 
this can be due to the high precision resulting from a high specificity even with a lower 
sensitivity value. It is important to mention that the F1 score can be influenced by skewed class 
proportions (Jeni et al., 2013) and needs to be considered when used as a performance measure. 
Both AUC and F1 scores were compared using paired t-tests with Bonferroni adjusted thresholds 
for inference.  
Comparing the sensitivity and specificity between RUSRF and the other predictors was 
performed using the McNemar’s �� test. The sensitivity of the RUSRF predictor was 
significantly higher only when compared to the SVM predictor. This can be greatly due to the 
low number of pMCI individuals (n=13) in the test set, as the statistic is calculated considering 
only the pMCI individuals. Furthermore, both L1 and L2 logistic regression predictors were 
nominally higher than the sensitivity of RUSRF. However, given the number of pMCI 
individuals, misclassification of even one individual can cause the sensitivity metric to fluctuate 
substantially. Although the specificity of both the SVM and the Random Forest predictors were 
 MANUSCRIPT

higher than RUSRF, their sensitivities were not acceptable for any clinical or research use. 
Among the RUSRF and logistic regression predictors, RUSRF achieved the highest specificity 
and was significantly different from L2 logistic regression at p < 0.0125 and from L1 logistic 
regression at p < 0.025. Although the SVM classifier is used widely in many applications, our 
analysis indicated that, at its current configuration with a radial basis kernel, it produced a very 
low sensitivity and is not suitable in identifying progressive MCI individuals. However, the 
SVM classifier can be trained with a number of kernel functions such as the polynomial kernel 
functions, sigmoid kernel functions, and linear kernel functions, and this would lead to increased 
sensitivity and overall classification performance.  
Direct comparisons with other similar studies conducted to assess the predictive capability of 
amyloid imaging based biomarkers cannot be performed due to a number of reasons (see 
summarized comparison in Table 3). Most studies (Brück et al., 2013; Hatashita and Yamasaki, 
2013; Clifford R Jack et al., 2010; Wolk et al., 2009) have used [11C]PiB PET as the imaging 
biomarker, as it was commonly used prior to the introduction of [18F]-based radio ligands (except 
the authors of (Waragai et al., 2009), have used [11C]BF-227 PET). Both (Teipel et al., 2015) and 
(Schreiber et al., 2015) have used [18F]Florbetapir PET, however, (Teipel et al., 2015) have used 
both [18F]FDG PET and MRI biomarkers in combination with amyloid PET as the input features 
for the predictor. Furthermore, studies with similar observation periods (Brück et al., 2013; 
Ewers et al., 2012; Clifford R Jack et al., 2010; Waragai et al., 2009) have reported much higher 
progression rates. These increased rates may be due to the low number of subjects included 
(Waragai et al., 2009) by specialized memory clinics (Brück et al., 2013) and the lower baseline 
Mini-Mental State Examination scores reported (Brück et al., 2013; Ewers et al., 2012; Clifford 
R Jack et al., 2010; Waragai et al., 2009).  
Nevertheless, these studies except for (Teipel et al., 2015) have not used any model evaluation 
technique, such as cross validation, to assess how their models will generalize to an independent 
data set, which is of paramount importance to be successfully used as an early diagnosis tool in a 
clinical environment. We obtained a higher overall accuracy, AUC, and sensitivity compared to 
the accuracy reported by (Teipel et al., 2015). The low sensitivity values reported in (Teipel et 
al., 2015) may be due the lower proportion of pMCI individuals included in the study, leading to 
a bias towards the majority sMCI group. The novel algorithm introduced in this study 
compensates for this ‘imbalanced class problem’ by using data sampling techniques as 
mentioned earlier.  
Compared to several previous studies using not only Aβ PET based biomarkers, the algorithm 
introduced here seems promising with a recorded average AUC of 0.906 for an independent test 
set (accuracy: 0.84, sensitivity: 0.708, specificity: 0.865). Often, studies use performance 
measures (AUC, accuracy, sensitivity and specificity) based only on cross validation; however, 
this makes the prediction model biased towards the data set used, as all the samples are used for 
training at some point in the analysis. The present study uses a completely independent testing 
set to evaluate the true generalization capability of the model presented. The independent testing 
 MANUSCRIPT

set is not used in the feature extraction step or the model training steps. By evaluating the 
performance of the prediction model based on a completely independent testing set, we can 
retrieve the true expected performance of the model when used in a clinical environment as an 
early diagnostic tool. The generalization capability can be further improved by training the 
model on data acquired from multiple cohorts, as using a test set from the same cohort can add 
bias to the prediction model.  
The most important characteristic of the present study is its ability to overcome the inherent 
imbalance of proportion between pMCI and sMCI individuals and performing comparably or 
even better than the previous studies. Studies conducted by Cho et al., 2012; Davatzikos et al., 
2011; Misra et al., 2009; Teipel et al., 2015 used cohorts with imbalanced proportions similar to 
the present study to train their prediction models, which resulted in lower sensitivity scores and 
lower AUC values.  
One other important outcome from the present study is the relative predictive capability of the 
investigated brain regions (Figure 3b) based on Aβ retention. Our study indicated that the four 
brain regions, the Temporal Occipital Junction, Mid Temporal Cortex, Mid Frontal Cortex and 
Precuneus to have the highest predictive ability. Other studies conducted with Aβ PET based 
biomarkers also identified similar regions to have the highest difference between individuals 
progressing to Alzheimer’s disease and sMCI individuals (Brück et al., 2013; Koivunen et al., 
2011; Teipel et al., 2015). These regions are known to show Aβ deposition in relatively later 
stages of the course of Alzheimer’s disease. This agrees with the idea that the regions with early 
deposition of Aβ such as the posterior cingulate cortex, already reaches a plateau in the MCI 
stage, adding little information to discriminate individuals progressing to Alzheimer’s disease, 
whereas regions with later build-up are more relevant in discriminating stable and progressing 
MCI individuals. Interestingly, the feature selection technique identified sub-cortical structures 
such as the Putamen and the Nucleus Accumbens to be used as features for classification. It is 
worth to emphasize, that patients with AD, have shown increased deposition of Aβ in these 
subcortical brain regions occurring later in the disease spectrum (Ishibashi et al., 2014). 
Furthermore, these regions receive projections from different prefrontal sub-regions, mainly 
from the medial prefrontal cortex (Ferry et al., 2000; Ongür and Price, 2000), and their 
associations to with behavioral characteristics and cognitive performance are well known (de 
Jong et al., 2012; Diekhof et al., 2012). When evaluating the brain Aβ deposition, the consensus 
of the field of Alzheimer’s disease is to use the average deposition from the brain regions 
characteristic of Alzheimer’s disease. However, this method averages the Aβ deposition in brain 
regions which accumulate in different stages of Alzheimer’s disease, and will result in a sub 
optimal discriminating capability compared to the method introduced in the article (see 
Supplementary material for results of RUSRF performance with average brain Aβ deposition). 
Identifying the relative importance of Aβ deposition in various brain regions provides many 
benefits to research studies of anti-amyloid agents to evaluate the treatment’s effect in preventing 
or slowing the progression to Alzheimer’s disease.

It is important to mention several limitations of the present study. Any Alzheimer’s disease study 
involving in-vivo data suffers from the inherent uncertainty of the diagnosis (Eskildsen et al., 
2013). This is because the diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease can only be confirmed with autopsy 
data. Therefore, any clinical diagnosis will always be “probable Alzheimer’s disease”. It is 
estimated that around 10% of this “probable Alzheimer’s disease” diagnosis can be mislabeled 
“Lewy Body disease” or “Frontotemporal dementia” (Ranginwala et al., 2008). Thus, the 
patterns learnt by the predictor might not be specific to Alzheimer’s disease; however, this has 
been partially addressed by using an Alzheimer’s disease specific biomarker such as Aβ PET 
compared to a general neurodegenerative biomarker such as MRI or glucose metabolism.  
It is important to emphasize that the population included in this analysis represents a select group 
of amnestic MCI individuals motivated to participate in a dementia study, as such, for reasons 
related to the study inclusion criteria these individuals may not represent the general MCI 
population. Therefore, it would be highly desirable to replicate our findings in a population-
based cohort. Furthermore, the predictor presented here is biased to the [18F]Florbetapir PET 
acquisition protocol followed by ADNI, as the training and testing was done using only the data 
acquired from the ADNI database. Hence, clinical implementations of the present study will still 
require additional reliability assessments by training the predictor using multiple acquisition 
protocols to increase the robustness of the prediction. Similarly, the feature extraction step 
included identifying brain regions with a scaled odds ratio above 1.5, based on the expert 
opinion. The rationale behind this step was to select the anatomically significant brain regions 
with an increase of odds for developing Alzheimer’s disease of 50% for each 1 standard 
deviation increase of SUVR. However, this step can add bias towards the subjective opinion of 
the expert and can be avoided by selecting brain regions based on the opinion of multiple experts 
or by using an automated cluster based technique. Furthermore, due to the computational cost of 
performing multiple voxel-wise logistic regression analyses, the feature selection technique 
employed a single voxel-wise logistic regression analysis including all the subjects (excluding 
the ones used as the final test dataset). However, the stability of the identified regions can be 
further increased by employing an under-sampling technique in identifying the features. 
In conclusion, we present a novel algorithm to predict the progression to Alzheimer’s disease 
dementia within MCI individuals based on their Aβ PET measurements. The predictor presented 
here achieved a high rate of accuracy with an AUC of 0.906 for an independent test set. The 
novel algorithm overcomes the inherent imbalance of proportions between stable and progressive 
MCI seen in a population of MCI individuals, making it ideally suited for a clinical environment 
as an early diagnostic tool. Demonstration of such a tool using the data presented in the current 
article can be found at http://predictalz.tnlmcgill.ca/PredictAlz_Amy.
