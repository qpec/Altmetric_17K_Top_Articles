IMPORTANCE Medicare recently launched the Physician Value-Based Payment Modifier
(PVBM) Program, a mandatory pay-for-performance program for physician practices. Little is
known about performance by practices that serve socially or medically high-risk patients.
OBJECTIVE To compare performance in the PVBM Program by practice characteristics.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Cross-sectional observational study using PVBM
Program data for payments made in 2015 based on performance of large US physician
practices caring for fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries in 2013.
EXPOSURES High social risk (defined as practices in the top quartile of proportion of patients
dually eligible for Medicare and Medicaid) and high medical risk (defined as practices in the
top quartile of mean Hierarchical Condition Category risk score among fee-for-service
beneficiaries).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Quality and cost z scores based on a composite of individual
measures. Higher z scores reflect better performance on quality; lower scores, better
performance on costs.
RESULTS Among 899 physician practices with 5 189 880 beneficiaries, 547 practices were
categorized as low risk (neither high social nor high medical risk) (mean, 7909 beneficiaries;
mean, 320 clinicians), 128 were high medical risk only (mean, 3675 beneficiaries; mean, 370
clinicians), 102 were high social risk only (mean, 1635 beneficiaries; mean, 284 clinicians), and
122 were high medical and social risk (mean, 1858 beneficiaries; mean, 269 clinicians).
Practices categorized as low risk performed the best on the composite quality score (z score,
0.18 [95% CI, 0.09 to 0.28]) compared with each of the practices categorized as high risk
(high medical risk only: z score, −0.55 [95% CI, −0.77 to −0.32]; high social risk only: z score,
−0.86 [95% CI, −1.17 to −0.54]; and high medical and social risk: −0.78 [95% CI, −1.04 to
−0.51]) (P < .001 across groups). Practices categorized as high social risk only performed the
best on the composite cost score (z score, −0.52 [95% CI, −0.71 to −0.33]), low risk had the
next best cost score (z score, −0.18 [95% CI, −0.25 to −0.10]), then high medical and social
risk (z score, 0.40 [95% CI, 0.23 to 0.57]), and then high medical risk only (z score, 0.82
[95% CI, 0.65 to 0.99]) (P < .001 across groups). Total per capita costs were $9506 for
practices categorized as low risk, $13 683 for high medical risk only, $8214 for high social risk
only, and $11 692 for high medical and social risk. These patterns were associated with fewer
bonuses and more penalties for high-risk practices.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE During the first year of the Medicare Physician Value-Based
Payment Modifier Program, physician practices that served more socially high-risk
patients had lower quality and lower costs, and practices that served more medically
high-risk patients had lower quality and higher costs.

 A
mbulatory pay-for-performance programs provide in-
centives for physician practices to improve the care
they deliver. The Medicare Physician Value-Based
Payment Modifier (PVBM) Program, which launched in 2015,
will be the largest mandatory pay-for-performance program
for physicians when fully phased in. Under this program,
physician practices receive penalties or bonuses (from −1% to
10% of Medicare payments in 2015) based on the quality and
costs of care. The PVBM Program serves as a precursor to the
MedicareQualityPaymentProgram,whichwilllaunchin2019,
apply to clinicians and practices, and measure performance
acrossabroaderarrayofmetrics.ClinicianseligibleinthePVBM
Program include physicians, nurse practitioners, and physi-
cian assistants.
Despitethegrowthofambulatorypay-for-performancepro-
grams, there is concern about unintended consequences, in-
cluding disproportionately penalizing practices that care for
complex patients. Prior studies have shown that patients with
highlevelsofmedicalriskaswellaspatientswithsocialriskfac-
tors, such as those dually enrolled in Medicare and Medicaid,
have worse quality outcomes.1,2 Thus, it is possible that physi-
cian practices that care for these high-risk populations will fare
poorly in pay-for-performance programs. The PVBM Program
has instituted safeguards such as risk adjustment, eliminating
measures with extreme performance values, and using conser-
vativeperformancethresholdsforbonusesandpenaltiestomiti-
gate potential risks faced by participating practices.
However, there are no prior studies of the PVBM Program
andlittleisknownaboutperformancepatterns.Therefore,this
study sought to answer 3 questions. What are the patient, prac-
tice, and clinician characteristics of large physician practices
that serve a disproportionate share of medically or socially
high-risk patients? How did large practices perform on qual-
ity and cost performance metrics included in the PVBM
Program? What implications did any performance differ-
ences have on payment?
Methods
Data Sources and Study Population
We performed a cross-sectional observational study using
PVBM Program data for payments made in 2015 based on
performance of large US physician practices caring for
fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries in 2013. To charac-
terize physician practices, we used the Provider Enrollment,
Chain, and Ownership System, PVBM Program data, and the
Medicare Electronic Health Record Incentive Program Eli-
gible Professionals Public Use File.
Performance metrics are based on a core set of claims-
based mandatory measures as well as more than 200 elective
measuresfromavarietyofsources(eg,registries,claims,medi-
cal record–based data submitted to the Centers for Medicare
& Medicaid Services [CMS] via a web interface). Policy re-
search at the US Department of Health and Human Services
thatusessecondary,administrative,anddeidentifieddatadoes
not require approval by an institutional review board or in-
formed consent.
The study sample consisted of physician practices
that were eligible for the PVBM Program during its first year
(ie,practicesthatwerenotparticipatingintheMedicareShared
Savings Program or the Comprehensive Primary Care Initia-
tive and had ≥100 physicians or other clinicians), and had at
least 1 attributed fee-for-service Medicare beneficiary. These
data were linked to Medicare claims from 2013 to identify pa-
tients and physicians. Fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries
were attributed to practices using the PVBM algorithm, which
is based on the setting where a beneficiary received the plu-
rality of primary care services.3
Primary Exposures
Following PVBM Program parameters,3 physician practices
with a mean Hierarchical Condition Category (HCC) risk score
greater than the 75th percentile among all fee-for-service ben-
eficiaries were categorized as practices with high medical risk
(eFigure 1 in the Supplement). Similarly, physician practices
in the top quartile of the proportion of attributed beneficia-
ries who were dually eligible for Medicare and Medicaid
(defined as enrollment in Medicaid in January 2013) were cat-
egorized as practices with high social risk (eFigure 2 in the
Supplement). From these 2 primary exposures, we created 4
mutually exclusive groups: (1) low risk (neither high social nor
high medical risk); (2) high medical risk only; (3) high social
risk only; and (4) high medical and social risk.
Primary Outcome Measures
The primary outcome measures were the PVBM Program qual-
ity composite score and cost composite score.3 Each prac-
tice’
s composite scores are based on a combination of manda-
tory and elective measures of their choosing. The quality score
is reported as a z score and is based on performance across 6
domains: clinical process and effectiveness, patient and fam-
ily engagement, population and public health, patient safety,
care coordination, and efficient use of health care resources
(eAppendix and eTable 1 in the Supplement). For a given do-
main or measure, a z score was created by taking the prac-
tice’
s performance and subtracting the average performance
of comparison practices. This difference was then divided by
the measure’
s standard deviation among all comparison prac-
tices, producing a z score. For a given measure, the compari-
son practices were the subset of practices with data for that
Key Points
Question Was there an association between the social or medical
risk of patients treated at physician practices and performance
during the first year of the Medicare Physician Value-Based
Payment Modifier Program?
Findings Practices that served more socially high-risk patients
had lower quality and lower costs, and practices that served more
medically high-risk patients had lower quality and higher costs.
These patterns were associated with fewer bonuses and more
penalties for high-risk practices.
Meaning As value-based payment programs continue to increase
in size and scope, practices that disproportionately serve high-risk
patients may be at particular risk of receiving financial penalties.

 measure. The cost score is also reported as a z score and is com-
posed of the 2 domains of total per capita costs for all attrib-
uted beneficiaries and per capita costs for beneficiaries with
specific conditions, which were averaged to create a cost com-
posite for each practice.
The secondary outcome measures for quality were
individual metrics, including the following mandatory,
claims-based quality measures used in the PVBM Program:
(1) all-cause readmissions (risk-adjustment model included
age and a number of clinical comorbidities as specified by the
CMS), (2) admissions for acute ambulatory care–sensitive
conditions (adjusted for age and sex), and (3) admissions for
chronic ambulatory care–sensitive conditions (adjusted
for age and sex).
The secondary outcome measures for costs were the fol-
lowing mandatory, claims-based metrics calculated by the
CMS for the PVBM Program: (1) total per capita costs and
per capita costs for (2) heart failure, (3) diabetes mellitus,
(4) chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and (5) coronary
artery disease. The CMS payment standardizes the per capita
cost measures to account for geographic differences in
prices, and includes risk adjustment to account for patient
case mix. The risk-adjustment model controls for HCC risk
score, HCC risk score squared, and end-stage renal disease.
The HCC risk score includes 70 categories corresponding to
specific groups of International Classification of Diseases,
Ninth Revision, diagnosis codes and age, sex, Medicaid, and
original reason for Medicare qualification (ie, age or disabil-
ity). Measure performance was reported as a z score and as an
absolute value (eg, $1000).
The other secondary outcomes were payment ad-
justments (ie, performance-based bonus, no adjustment,
penalty for not reporting, performance-based penalty).
These were determined by following program parameters
from the CMS. Physician practices that failed to successfully
register for the program and report a minimum number
of measures received an automatic penalty for not report-
ing (nonparticipation).
Practices were categorized as high or low quality (or high
or low cost) only if their z score for quality (or cost) was more
than 1 SD from the peer group mean and the difference was
statistically significant. Physician practices that elected to tie
performance to payment received a penalty if they had
(1) low quality and high or average cost or (2) average quality
and high cost. Physician practices received an upward pay-
ment adjustment if they had (1) high quality and low or aver-
age cost or (2) average quality and low cost (eTable 2 in the
Supplement). All other practices received no adjustment.
Statistical Analysis
The characteristics of the 4 types of physician practices were
compared using χ2 tests. To compare differences in perfor-
mance on the outcomes listed earlier, we used quality and cost
metrics calculated by the CMS and z scores for domain and
compositescores.UsingtheCMS’performancemetrics,wecre-
atedunadjustedordinaryleast-squaresregressionmodelswith
practice type as the primary predictor. For the practices that
did not have a sufficient number of cases for individual mea-
sures,wedidnotimputemissingvalues.ThismirrorsthePVBM

s approach.
We also described how payments differed across practice
types. In our first set of analyses, we reported on actual bo-
nuses and penalties, only assigning performance-based pen-
alties to those practices that elected this option. In a set of
exploratory analyses, we used performance data to simulate
bonuses and penalties for all participating practices because
performance-based payment is mandatory starting in 2016 for
largephysicianpractices.Orderedlogitregressionmodelswere
used to test for statistically significant differences in pay-
ments between the 4 physician practice risk categories.
We used Stata statistical software version 13 (StataCorp)
and SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc). Two-sided P < .01
was considered statistically significant to account for mul-
tiple testing.
Results
Patient, Physician, and Practice Characteristics
Among 899 physician practices with 5 189 880 attributed
beneficiaries, 547 practices were categorized as low risk (nei-
ther high social risk nor high medical risk) (mean, 7909 ben-
eficiaries; mean, 320 clinicians), 128 were high medical risk
only (mean, 3675 beneficiaries; mean, 370 clinicians), 102
were high social risk only (mean, 1635 beneficiaries; mean,
284 clinicians), and 122 were high medical and social risk
(mean, 1858 beneficiaries; mean, 269 clinicians) (Table 1).
Although 79.2% of low-risk practices successfully registered
and reported data to the program (thus avoiding the auto-
matic reporting penalty), this was done in only 69.5% of
practices with high medical risk only, 47.1% of practices with
high social risk only, and 54.1% of practices with high medi-
cal and social risk.
High-risk practices served patient populations that were
generally younger and more often of ethnic minority, dually
enrolled in Medicare and Medicaid, and disabled (Table 1).
For example, 8% of patients treated at low-risk practices were
black, 16% at practices with high medical risk only, 24% at
practices with high social risk only, and 31% at practices with
both high medical and social risk (P < .001). There were few
major differences in physician specialty or practice size
across practice types (Table 1). However, stage 1 meaningful
use (defined as the adoption of certified electronic health rec-
ords across a number of dimensions as specified by the CMS)
was higher in practices categorized as low risk (31%) and high
medical risk only (29%) compared with practices categorized
as high social risk only (8%) and high medical and social risk
(14%) (P < .001).
Performance on Domain and Composite Scores
Practices categorized as low risk performed the best on the
composite quality score (z score, 0.18 [95% CI, 0.09 to 0.28])
compared with each of the practices categorized as high risk
(high medical risk only: z score, −0.55 [95% CI, −0.77 to −0.32];
high social risk only: z score, −0.86 [95% CI, −1.17 to −0.54];
and high medical and social risk: z score, −0.78 [95% CI, −1.04

 to −0.51]) (part A in the Figure and eTable 3 in the Supple-
ment) (P < .001 across groups). Patterns were generally simi-
lar for each of the quality domains, with low-risk practices out-
performing the higher-risk practice groups on every domain
with the exception of population and public health.
However, patterns for costs differed. On the composite
cost score, practices categorized as high social risk only per-
formed best (z score, −0.52 [95% CI, −0.71 to −0.33]). Low-
risk practices (z score, −0.18 [95% CI, −0.25 to −0.10])
performed next best, whereas practices categorized as high
medical risk only (z score, 0.82 [95% CI, 0.65 to 0.99]) and
high medical and social risk (z score, 0.40 [95% CI, 0.23 to
0.57]) had the highest costs (part B in the Figure and eTable 3
in the Supplement) (P < .001 across groups). Patterns were
similar for both cost domains.
Performance on PVBM Program Quality and Cost Measures
Risk-adjusted readmission rates were lowest at practices cat-
egorized as low risk (15.3%) compared with practices catego-
rized as high medical risk only (16.3%; difference from low
risk, 1.01% [95% CI, 0.79%-1.23%]; P < .001), high social risk
only (15.9%; difference from low risk, 0.58% [95% CI, 0.31%-
0.85%]; P < .001), and high medical and social risk (16.6%;
difference from low risk, 1.32% [95% CI, 1.08%-1.55%];
P < .001; Table 2). Compared with low-risk practices, admis-
sions for acute ambulatory care–sensitive conditions were
higher in the practices categorized as high medical risk only
and high medical and social risk practices. In contrast, admis-
sions for chronic ambulatory care–sensitive conditions were
similar across groups.
The total per capita costs were $9506 for practices cat-
egorized as low risk, $13 683 for high medical risk only (differ-
ence from low risk, $4177 [95% CI, $3437 to $4917]; P < .001),
$8214 for high social risk only (difference from low risk,
−$1292 [95% CI, −$2105 to −$480]; P = .002), and $11 692 for
high medical and social risk (difference from low risk, $2186
[95% CI, $1432 to $2940]; P < .001) (Table 2). Patterns were
similar for the condition-specific cost measures.
Penalties and Bonuses
Only 112 physician practices opted to receive performance-
based payment during the first year of the PVBM Program
(when performance-based bonuses and penalties were
optional). Thus, actual penalties were largely driven by fail-
ure to register and report data (Table 3 and eTables 4 and 5
in the Supplement). Such penalties were more common in

 Discussion
In this analysis of the first year of Medicare’
s new physician
pay-for-performance program based on 899 practices with
5 189 880 attributed Medicare beneficiaries, performance pat-
terns differed by physician practice type. Compared with prac-
tices categorized as low risk, practices with high medical risk
only and with high medical and social risk had lower quality
and higher costs, whereas practices with high social risk only
had lower quality but lower costs. Because of a high fre-
quency of failure to register and report data as well as these
differences in performance, physician practices that served a
disproportionate share of medically and socially high-risk pa-
tients were more likely to receive a penalty compared with
other practices.
The largest driver of penalties during the first year of the
PVBM Program was failure to successfully register and
report. Even though some percentage of practices failing to
participate may reflect an active choice, some may reflect a
lack of infrastructure or technology that makes reporting
more difficult, particularly among high-risk practices that
may lack access to electronic health records and other sup-
porting factors. This may be an important area for technical
support as the PVBM Program expands to include a broader
range of practices and as penalties for failure to participate
grow with the advent of the Merit-Based Incentive Payment
System (MIPS) in 2019.
Medical risk was associated with both worse quality and
higher costs. The mechanism underlying these relationships
is unclear. The findings from prior studies have been mixed,
with some studies finding that patients with multiple chronic
conditions are more likely to receive high-quality care,4-6 and
others finding that the relationship between multimorbidity
and quality is neutral or depends on the type of comorbidity
present.7,8 Research is less mixed for costs; many prior stud-
ies show that patients with more severe illness use more
medical care and require more resources,9-11 which is the
basis for risk adjustment of costs under this and other pro-
grams that assess clinicians’performance on costs of care.
Without patient-level analyses, it is difficult to determine
whether these higher costs are driven by inadequate risk
adjustment or by a high-intensity practice style, and this war-
rants future research.
The finding that practices categorized as high social risk
only performed significantly worse on quality metrics is
similar to previously described patterns in other care set-
tings also subject to differential payment based on quality,
such as safety-net hospitals under Medicare’
s value-based
payment programs12-14 and Medicare Advantage plans with
high proportions of patients dually enrolled in Medicare
and Medicaid under the Quality Star Rating Program.15,16
Patients treated at practices categorized as high social risk
only may face basic challenges such as transportation, food,
housing, and security, which are unmeasured in Medicare
claims but may be associated with outcomes. In some cases,
fewer resources may also make it more difficult for practices
who serve these patients to attract qualified clinicians.
With regard to costs of care, practices categorized as high
social risk only in the PVBM Program were less expensive
than practices that served a lower-risk population. These
findings may in part be explained by the PVBM Program’
s

 risk-adjustment model, which accounts for medical risk by
modeling cost as a function of HCC risk score and includes
Medicaid enrollment status as a covariate. Alternatively,
practices categorized as high social risk only may treat both
high- and low-risk patients in a less expensive style. Previous
studies have documented significant unmet health care
needs for poor patients,17,18 which may make these patients
less expensive to treat than predicted by risk models.
This study extends prior research describing disparities
in care for both socially and medically complex patients.19-25
Research on ambulatory pay-for-performance programs
(including certain patient-centered medical home models
and the UK’
s Quality and Outcomes Framework) has evalu-
ated the effects on quality and use26-34 or disparities in
care,35,36 but not the effects of such programs on clinicians
who serve vulnerable populations. The CMS report on the
first year of the PVBM Program did not examine the perfor-
mance of all PVBM Program–eligible practices, nor did it
describe practice performance by social risk.37
Better understanding of the disparities in ambulatory
programs may become increasingly important under the
MIPS, which is modeled after parts of the PVBM Program and
replaces it.38 Findings from this study suggest that if current
performance patterns persist, practices that serve a high pro-
portion of socially or medically complex patients may fare
poorly under the MIPS. There are a number of options to
address disparities, including development of health equity
measures.39 This latter option would be similar to the extra
bonus provided to practices that perform well in the PVBM
Program and serve medically complex patients.
Limitations
The study has several limitations. First, data for this analy-
sis were from the first year of the PVBM Program when only
large practices were eligible to participate in the program
and performance-based payment was optional. Although
these were the most recent data available, patterns of per-
formance may change as a broader range of practices are
included and as the program continues to evolve. Second,
dual enrollment in Medicare and Medicaid was used as a
marker of social risk. Because Medicaid provides additional
benefits, dual enrollment may underestimate the true effect
of caring for patients with high social risk absent any sup-
port from government programs. Third, this study exam-
ined Medicare patients only. Studies examining other
dimensions of social risk or other populations might reveal
different patterns.
Conclusions
During the first year of the Medicare Physician Value-Based
Payment Modifier Program, physician practices that served
more socially high-risk patients had lower quality and lower
costs, and practices that served more medically high-risk
patients had lower quality and higher costs.
