Abstract
 Introduction—Fishing is a common pastime. In the developed world, it is commonly 
performed as a recreational activity. We aim to determine injury patterns and outcomes among 
patients injured while ice fishing.
 Methods—Data on initial emergency department visits from the National Electronic Injury 
Surveillance System-All Injury Program (NEISS-AIP) from 2009-2014 were analyzed. All 
patients with fishing related injuries were included. Primary endpoint was rate of admission or 
transfer. Secondary endpoints were defined a priori anatomical injury categories and patients were 
assigned into groups. Descriptive and power analysis was performed between patients with ice-
fishing and traditional fishing related injuries.
 Results—We identified 8220 patients who sustained fishing related injuries, of which n=85 
(1%) involved ice fishing. Ice fishing injuries occurred primarily in males (88%) with a mean age 
of 39.4 years ± 17.5 (std dev). The most common injuries related to ice fishing were: orthopedic/
musculoskeletal (46%), minor trauma (37%), and major trauma (6%). Hot thermal injuries (burns) 
were the fourth most common type of ice-fishing injury (5%) but rarely occurred in warmer 
fishing months (<1%, p=0.004). Cold thermal injuries (1%) and hypothermia (0%) were rare 
among ice-fishing injuries and immersion/drowning occurred in 5% of cases. The rate of 
admission/transfer was significantly greater in ice-fishing (11%) than the traditional fishing 
patients 3%, p<0.001), power was 89.7%.
 Conclusion—Ice fishing is associated with more severe injury patterns and more thermal 
injuries and immersion injuries than traditional fishing. Providers and participants should be aware 
of the potential risks and benefits and counseled appropriately.

 Background
Fishing has been a common activity throughout human history. First used as a means of 
providing food to survive, it has since evolved into a recreational activity in the developed 
world. In the United States (US), outside of commercial fishing, it is commonly performed 
as a hobby or for sport. While commercial fishing is a hazardous occupation[1], it is unclear 
what risk recreational fishing presents in terms of injury patterns. The literature is limited to 
case reports and case series of isolated injuries, or high level epidemiological studies [2–6]. 
While traditional fishing is often associated with minor injuries such as hook punctures, the 
types of injuries associated with ice-fishing, with its unique environmental risks, is largely 
unknown [7].
In northern climates, fishermen routinely trek onto frozen bodies of water to fish for both 
sport and recreation. Commonly called ice-fishing, it is performed via a hole dug or cut 
through the ice, usually with an auger, to access the water below. Although the risk of 
submersion injuries is present in ice and traditional fishing, cold water poses additional risk 
of hypothermia. In addition, the cold atmospheric environment presents a high risk of 
hypothermia and frostbite. While individual practices vary, it is common to erect a soft or 
hard structure for shelter from the environment. Ice fisherman will often heat these 
structures with portable heaters, which are at risk of failing, exploding, catching fire, and 
causing inhalation injuries. All of these factors may pose additional risk when ice-fishing 
that may not be present during traditional fishing. The risk of these injuries, is unknown. We 
aim to identify injury patterns sustained by ice fishermen compared to traditional (non-ice) 
fishing in the US in an effort to increase awareness and drive evidence based injury 
prevention.
 Methods
Data on initial emergency department (ED) visits was obtained from the National Electronic 
Injury Surveillance System-All Injury Program (NEISS-AIP) from 2009-2014 and all 
patients with fishing related injuries were included (US Consumer Product Safety 
Commission [CPSC] diagnosis code 3223). NEISS is a collaborative between the Centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Center for Injury Prevention and 
Control, and the Consumer Product Safety Commission and collects data on initial US 
emergency room visits for all types of nonfatal injuries and poisonings [9]. Detailed 
information on the NEISS sampling methodology has been previously published [10,11].
In summary, data are drawn from a nationally representative subsample of over 100 hospitals 
that have 6 or more beds and a 24-hour ED across a wide variety of geographic regions. 
Trained abstractors extract information from ED records, including body part injured, 
diagnosis, external cause, injury intent, and a brief narrative with additional details about the

 injury. Cases are assigned 1 or 2 CPSC codes that designate what products or activities were 
involved at the time of injury.
For this study NEISS was queried for data on demographics, CPSC codes, body part(s) 
affected, patient disposition, and the brief narrative. Diagnosis codes were used to categorize 
injuries into the following groups: cold thermal injuries (e.g. isolated frostbite not due to 
immersion), hot thermal injuries (burns not including heat stroke), hyperthermia (from 
atmospheric exposure), hypothermia (from atmospheric exposure), immersion/drowning, 
foreign body ingestion (e.g. swallowing tackle), major trauma (amputation, organ space 
injury, and closed head injuries including concussions), minor trauma (lacerations, 
abrasions, contusions, punctures, and hook injuries), orthopedic/musculoskeletal (fractures, 
sprains, strains and minor musculoskeletal injuries), medical problems (general medical 
conditions that happened to occur while fishing), and bites/skin infections (e.g. insect bites 
and delayed infections after hook injuries). Additional data was then abstracted from the 
brief narrative in duplicate (CAT and JMA). NEISS narratives generally describe how the 
injury occurred but are highly variable in length and content. To minimize variability of the 
data collected only targeted information was obtained. The narratives were used to identify 
injuries that occurred while ice-fishing, mechanism of injury, intoxication data, and 
additional detail regarding the diagnosis to aid in categorization.
Descriptive statistical analysis was performed using JMP software version 10.0.0 (SAS 
Institute, Inc). Comparison between ice fishing and non-ice fishing demographic, injury 
patterns, and outcomes was assessed using student t test (2-tailed), Mann-Whitney U test, 
and Fisher exact test as indicated with a p value < 0.05 being significant.
 Results
Between 2009 and 2014, we identified n=8220 patients who sustained fishing related 
injuries, of which n=85 (1.03%) were related to ice fishing. The percent of fishing injuries 
due to ice-fishing increased slightly over the course of the study (0.52% in 2009 to 1.09% in 
2014, R2=0.31) (Figure 1). January was the most common month for ice fishing injuries 
(38.8% of ice-fishing injuries); all ice fishing injuries occurred between November and 
April. When compared to traditional fishing, patients that presented with injuries were 
similar in age (36.6 ± 25.1 years traditional fishing vs ice fishing 39.4 ± 17.5, p=0.31). The 
majority of both ice-fishing related patients (88.2%) and traditional fishing patients (80.4%) 
were men (p=0.07). Patients injured while ice-fishing were more likely to be Caucasian 
(74.1%) compared to traditional fishing (58.7%, p=0.034). When comparing ice fishing to 
traditional fishing the type of injuries varied significantly between groups (Table 1).
The most common ice-fishing related injuries were orthopedic/musculoskeletal (45.9%, 
n=39) followed by minor trauma (36.5%, n=31), major trauma (5.9%, n=5), and immersion/
drowning (4.7%, n=4). Immersion/drowning injuries occurred in December (n=2) and 
March (n=2). Interestingly, hot thermal injuries were tied for the fourth most common injury 
type (4.7%, n=4) and cold thermal injuries (1.2%, n=1) and hypothermia (0%, n=0) were 
rarely reported. Ice-fishing injured patients were more likely to have torso (p<0.001) and 
>50% body area injuries (p=0.01) while traditional fishing injuries were more likely to be

 upper extremity injuries (p=<0.001, Figure 2). The majority of ice-fishing injuries occurred 
on public/recreational land (89.4%) and the remainder occurred on home or farm property 
(10.6%). Although intoxication was rarely reported in the case narratives it was reported 
twice as often in the narrative of ice-fishing injuries (1.2%) compared to traditional fishing 
(0.6%) injuries.
Outcomes also varied between ice-fishing and non-ice fishing related injuries. Although the 
majority of ice-fishing patients were treated and released from the emergency room (89.4%), 
the rate of admission/transfer was significantly higher (10.6%) than the traditional fishing 
patients (2.6%, p<0.001). There were no ED fatalities reported in the ice-fishing group, but 
there were two in the traditional fishing group (p=1.0).
 Discussion
Data from the NEISS-AIP demonstrates that among patients that present to the ED with 
fishing related injuries, ice-fishing related injury patterns are more severe than their warmer 
weather counterparts. These injuries appear to be uniquely related to the inherent risk 
associated with ice-fishing. Furthermore, hot thermal burns were much more common 
among ice-fishermen than traditional fishermen. Given that ice-fishing has increased by 11% 
over the time period of 2006 to 2011 [12,13], it is important that this information be used to 
drive injury prevention education and determine specific injury prevention targets.
The majority of ice-fishing injuries were minor, but there were some unique injury patterns 
identified that warrant further investigation and discussion. Thermal injuries that occurred 
while ice-fishing, though somewhat counterintuitive, were likely due to the heating systems 
employed to keep ice-fishermen warm. These systems are often used in makeshift structures 
and with little regulation or oversight. Given the unique environmental setting one would 
suspect that hypothermia from atmospheric exposure would be a significant risk, but our 
data suggest that immersion related hypothermia should be an important target for future 
injury prevention.
A significant contributing factor toward death or accident in high sea commercial fishing 
industry is alcohol use and also appears to be a risk factor for immersion and death during 
boating and fishing [6]. It is difficult to assess the extent to which alcohol plays a role among 
ice-fishing related injuries in this study given the data limitations of the NEISS database. 
However, intoxication was reported twice as often in the narrative of ice-fishing injuries 
compared to traditional fishing injuries warranting further investigation. Unfortunately, there 
is no literature or case series for which to compare our results, as the majority of data is on 
individual injury locations in non-ice fishing such as ocular and hook related injuries 
[2,4,14,15], is epidemiologically based [6], or is aimed at studying commercial fishing 
[1,16]. The available literature suggests that fishing has inherent dangers beyond the 
estimation of most providers. This current study identified differences between ice fishing 
and traditional fishing in regards to injury patterns and outcomes. While further study is 
needed this may help with injury prevention.

  Limitations
The NEISS may underestimate the number of ED-treated fishing related injuries because 
only the principal diagnosis is captured. Patients who self-treat or seek care from non-ED 
settings are not sampled or captured by the NEISS. In addition ice-fishing may occur in 
more remote locations than traditional fishing with potentially limited access to care. 
Although NEISS is a nationally representative sample of injuries this could still result in an 
underestimation of ice-fishing injuries. There is no code of ice-fishing in NEISS and 
therefore the identification of an ice-fishing related injury was performed using the narrative. 
We may therefore be underreporting ice-fishing related injuries. In addition, it is possible 
that ice fisherman and traditional fisherman may not be equally likely to present to seek 
treatment. For example people that ice-fish may be tougher or more resilient due to the 
nature of the sport and therefore less like to present for care for minor injuries than their 
warmer weather counterparts, and this may be a source of selection bias. Furthermore, it is 
possible that there may be higher mortality for ice fishing or traditional fishing related 
injuries than is reported through NIESS since death before after the ED visit is not captured. 
Lastly, a significant limitation of NIESS is the lack of denominator data to calculate activity-
specific rates [17] as the overall number of participants in the activity is unknown.
 Conclusion
Ice-fishing as a recreational activity and sport is associated with more severe injury patterns 
when compared to traditional fishing and has a unique injury pattern and environmental risks 
that were previously unreported. Participants should be aware of the potential risk and injury 
prevention education should be tailored around this information.
