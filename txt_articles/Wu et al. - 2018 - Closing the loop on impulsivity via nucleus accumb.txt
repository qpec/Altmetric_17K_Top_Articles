Reward hypersensitization is a common feature of neuropsychi-
atric disorders, manifesting as impulsivity for anticipated incen-
tives. Temporally specific changes in activity within the nucleus
accumbens (NAc), which occur during anticipatory periods pre-
ceding consummatory behavior, represent a critical opportunity
for intervention. However, no available therapy is capable of
automatically sensing and therapeutically responding to this
vulnerable moment in time when anticipation-related neural
signals may be present. To identify translatable biomarkers for
an off-the-shelf responsive neurostimulation system, we record
local field potentials from the NAc of mice and a human
anticipating conventional rewards. We find increased power in
1- to 4-Hz oscillations predominate during reward anticipation,
which can effectively trigger neurostimulation that reduces con-
summatory behavior in mice sensitized to highly palatable food.
Similar oscillations are present in human NAc during reward
anticipation, highlighting the translational potential of our find-
ings in the development of a treatment for a major unmet need.

mpulsivity is one of the most pervasive and disabling features
common to many disorders of the brain (1–3). Heightened
responsivity in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) during anticipation
of a rewarding stimulus predisposes to impulsive behavior, which
can have severe implications for development of maladaptive
behaviors (4–8). Notably, electrophysiological, neurochemical,
and functional neuroimaging correlates have been reported in
multiple species during brief windows of anticipation (5, 9–13).
These correlates (or biomarkers) that precede a “moment of
weakness” have potential to inform a therapeutic to deliver a
time-sensitive intervention.
Recently, a responsive neurostimulation (RNS) system was
approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for ad-
junctive treatment of partial onset seizures (14). This intracranial
closed-loop system has proven capable of detecting epileptiform
activity and preventing propagation by responsively delivering
electrical stimulation directly to the seizure onset zone. Here, we
examine the potential for RNS to intervene during a vulnerable
period immediately preceding receipt of highly rewarding stim-
uli, an undertaking that has immediate translational potential
given the availability of this system. We leveraged the finding
that electrically stimulating the NAc in mice anticipating a food
reward effectively attenuates binge-eating behavior (15). To
“close the loop” on this intervention using an automatic stimu-
latory system, however, the identification, characterization, and
refinement of an anticipatory biomarker are critical next steps.
Given that the currently approved RNS system is limited to
local field potential (LFP) recordings due to its implanted depth
macroelectrodes’ spatial resolution, we make LFP recordings
from the mouse and human NAc during a period of reward
anticipation, and find prominent delta oscillations elicited during
anticipation of a highly rewarding stimulus. Multiunit analysis
reveals strong correlations between delta oscillations and unit
activities in the NAc. Utilizing this translational biomarker as a
trigger, RNS blocked binge eating in mice with remarkable be-
havioral specificity, thereby taking the first critical step toward the
development of a targeted intervention for neuropsychiatric pa-
tients suffering from hypersensitivity to pathological motivations.
Results
Increase in NAc Delta-Range Field Potentials Precedes Binge Eating in
Mice. Multielectrode arrays were implanted into the NAc of mice
(n = 6) (Fig. 1 A–D). Following a 1-wk recovery period, these
mice were put on a protocol of 1-h daily exposure to high fat
(HF) (standard house chow ad libitum) known to induce binge-
like eating behavior (defined as consumption of >25% of daily
caloric intake from HF; Fig. 1 E–G). Given prior reports across
species of changes in NAc cell firing during reward anticipation
(13, 16, 17), mouse NAc LFPs were recorded daily for 2 h, 1 h
before and 1 h during exposure to HF food. All mice reached cri-
terion for stable binge eating by day 10 (<10% variation across
3 consecutive days) (15). Power spectral density analyses of NAc
LFPs averaged across mice immediately before HF intake on days
0 and 10 were carried out. As a control, identical analyses were
performed immediately before the mice ingested standard chow
(Fig. 2 A–C). Because our goal was to interrupt a brief vulnerable
window in time immediately before a pathological impulse such as a
binge-eating episode, we used 2-s windows across a 4-s epoch, which
covered from 2 s before to 2 s after the onset of a binge.
Significance
We reveal prominent delta oscillations in the nucleus accum-
bens preceding food reward in mice and use them to guide
responsive neurostimulation to suppress binge-like behavior.
Similar electrographic signatures are observed in human nu-
cleus accumbens during reward anticipation as well, suggest-
ing their translational potential in the development of a
treatment for loss of impulse control in obesity and perhaps
additional brain disorders.

 The most robust change in LFPs was increased power in very-
low–frequency (delta) oscillations once binge eating developed
on day 10 immediately before HF intake (Fig. 2 D–H). Mean
time–frequency spectrograms and comparison of individual fre-
quency bands (delta, 1–4 Hz; alpha, 4–8 Hz; theta, 8–12 Hz; beta,
12–30 Hz; gamma, 30–50 Hz) confirmed that the only statisti-
cally significant change in spectral power occurred in the delta
frequency range immediately before HF intake after the devel-
opment of binge-like behavior, compared with baseline (day 0)
HF and chow control (delta: F = 6.165, P < 0.001; Tukey’s post
hoc test: chow vs. day 0 HF, n.s.; chow vs. day 10 HF, P < 0.01;
day 0 HF vs. day 10 HF, P < 0.01; Fig. 2H; alpha, theta, beta, and
gamma, chow vs. day 10 HF, n.s.). This increase in power in the
delta range was not detected immediately before chow intake,
suggesting it was not related to movement or bite artifact.
(Movie S1 illustrates increased power in the delta band during
HF intake.)
We next compared the delta power immediately before HF
consumption on day 10 with that during the entire 1-h exposure
to HF. NAc delta oscillations normalized to the entire 1-h period
of HF exposure revealed a 30% increase in power during the 2-s
window before onset of HF consumption (Fig. 2I). Analysis of
delta power peak distribution revealed a peak at ∼1 s before the
onset of HF consumption (Fig. 2J). To further test whether the
increase in delta power was specific for this highly appetitive
food, we recorded LFPs immediately before the interaction of
the experimental mice with a novel juvenile, an appetitive
experience with a finite, definable onset (Fig. 2K). Delta power
was significantly lower before the onset of juvenile interaction

 compared with the time period before onset of HF intake
[T(35) = 2.719, P < 0.05; Fig. S1]. Together, these results suggest
that an increase in delta power in LFPs recorded from the NAc
precede intake of HF in binge-eating mice and therefore may be
a useful biomarker to trigger RNS.
Delta Oscillations as a Biomarker for RNS. Based on the previous
findings, we assessed whether a delta-power threshold could
serve as a biomarker to optimize RNS to attenuate HF intake in
mice. The closed-loop system (Fig. 2L) was set to trigger
whenever delta power exceeded a predefined threshold based on
delta peak distribution and power analyses (a threshold of 20%
higher than baseline delta power was used, or 1 SD below the
mean power immediately before the onset of HF intake; Fig. 2I).
When this threshold was reached, electrodes delivered a bipolar,
biphasic, 0.1-mA stimulation at 130 Hz for 10 s (Fig. 3A).
We compared the efficacy of RNS with that of other neuro-
stimulation protocols in the same experimental animals. Specif-
ically, we also tested (i) continuous electrical stimulation during
the entire 1-h exposure to HF, a pattern of stimulation com-
monly referred to as deep brain stimulation (DBS) (130 Hz,
0.1 mA, bipolar, biphasic); (ii) manually triggered stimulation
during which an experimenter remotely observed the subjects’
behavior via video monitoring and triggered electrical stimula-
tion (130 Hz, 0.1 mA, 10 s, bipolar, biphasic stimulation) at the
immediate onset of HF consumption; and (iii) random stimula-
tion during which bouts of stimulation (130 Hz, 0.1 mA, 10 s,
bipolar, biphasic stimulation) were delivered randomly throughout
the entire 1-h HF exposure such that the total number of stimu-
lation bouts matched that delivered during the RNS protocols.
To ensure that caloric intake from HF returned to baseline in-
between the stimulation days, each session was followed by a
stimulation-off period (Fig. 3B). All of the stimulation protocols
significantly reduced HF intake except random stimulation [Fig.
3 C–F; DBS T(5) = 2.58, P < 0.05; manual T(5) = 3.75, P < 0.05;
RNS T(5) = 4.29, P < 0.01; random T(5) = 0.62, P = 0.56]. At the
end of these experiments, we repeated another session of RNS,
which reproduced the previously seen significant decrease in HF
intake [T(5) = 3.999, P < 0.01; Fig. S2A]. We compared the re-
duction of HF intake between each stimulation protocol and
found that the reductions in HF intake induced by manual
stimulation and RNS were significantly more robust than ran-
dom stimulation [sphericity assumed, F(4) = 7.034, P < 0.01; post
hoc: Manual vs. Random, P = 0.042; RNS vs. Random, P =
0.029; DBS vs. Random, DBS vs. Manual, DBS vs. RNS, Manual
vs. RNS, n.s., Bonferroni corrected; Fig. 3G]. Furthermore, the
number of bouts of stimulation used for manual and RNS were
significantly lower than DBS [F(1.566,7.813) = 65.80, P < 0.0001;
post hoc: DBS vs. Manual, P < 0.0001; DBS vs. RNS, P < 0.0001;
RNS vs. Manual, n.s.; Tukey’s correction applied; Fig. 3H].
(Movie S2 demonstrates RNS triggered by increased delta os-
cillations before HF intake.)
We conducted a number of additional behavioral assays to
determine whether RNS of the NAc might have detrimental side
effects. While DBS of the NAc significantly reduced the time
spent socially interacting in a juvenile interaction task, RNS
using the same delta-band power threshold as a trigger had no
significant effect on interaction time [F(2,21) = 4.557, P < 0.05;
post hoc: Off vs. DBS, P < 0.05; Off vs. RNS and RNS vs. DBS,
n.s.; Tukey’s correction applied; Fig. 3I]. The number of elec-
trical stimulation bouts during RNS was again significantly lower
than DBS [T(5) = 16.15, P < 0.0001]. Spontaneous locomotor
behavior during the 1-h daily HF exposure protocol was not af-
fected by DBS nor RNS [F(1.699,8.493) = 0.891, P = 0.429; Fig. 3J].
Furthermore, NAc stimulation (130-Hz, 0.1-mA, continuous,
bipolar, biphasic stimulation) did not induce real-time place
preference [T(5) = 0.2283, P = 0.8285; Fig. 3K]. These results
suggest that RNS of the NAc is neither reinforcing nor aversive,
and its effects can block consumption of HF food while sparing
normal locomotor and social behaviors. We also investigated the
sensitivity and specificity of delta oscillations as a biomarker for
food reward anticipation by reviewing the videotaped behavior
and determining when bouts of electrical stimulation triggered
during RNS occurred. Out of a total of 179 HF pellet ap-
proaches, 124 were detected by the RNS device such that stim-
ulation was triggered (sensitivity, 0.693; Fig. 3L). There were also
1,241 correct rejections (stimulation withheld when no HF ap-
proach occurred) and 685 stimulations triggered when no pellet
approach occurred (specificity, 0.644; Fig. 3M). Last, we found
that NAc DBS had no significant effect on 24-h chow con-
sumption (Fig. S2B).
To investigate the source of delta oscillations in the NAc
during HF consumption in mice, we searched for the occurrence
of single-unit activity in the LFP recordings. We identified one
type of spike shape consistently (Fig. 4A), which appeared sig-
nificantly more frequently on day 10 during HF consumption
when binge eating was prominent [F(2,12) = 5.221, P < 0.05; post
hoc: chow vs. day 0 HF, n.s.; chow vs. day 10 HF, P < 0.1; day
0 HF vs. day 10 HF, P < 0.05; Tukey corrected; Fig. 4 B and C].
The delta spike–field coupling, the strength of coupling between
spike times and the phase of LFP at delta frequency range, was
significantly higher on day 10 immediately before and during HF
consumption [F(2,12) = 8.102, P < 0.01; post hoc: chow vs. day

fMRI Activity and Delta Oscillations in Human NAc During Reward
Anticipation. To evaluate the translational potential of delta-
range field potentials providing physiologic, real-time optimiza-
tion for RNS in human patients suffering from impulsivity, we
recorded intraoperative LFPs from the NAc in a human subject
suffering from intractable obsessive-compulsive disorder during
a period of reward anticipation analogous to the phase of food
reward anticipation examined in mice. Specifically, because in
the operating room food rewards could not be provided, we in-
stead elicited anticipation of monetary rewards with a well-
established neuroimaging task [i.e., the monetary incentive delay
(MID) task]. During each trial of the MID task, a subject sees a
visual cue indicating that they will gain or avoid losing an in-
dicated monetary incentive (reward or punishment) by sub-
sequently pressing a button in response to a rapidly presented
target. This task allows researchers to distinguish neural re-
sponses during different stages of reward processing, including
reward anticipation and outcomes (10) (Fig. 5A).
Before surgery during a diagnostic magnetic resonance imag-
ing (MRI) scan, fMRI revealed a significant increase in blood
oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal in the NAc during an-
ticipation of high monetary reward [high reward:baseline, T(17) =
3.23, P < 0.01, uncorrected; low reward:baseline, high punish-
ment:baseline, low punishment:baseline, n.s.; Fig. 5 B and C;
summary of head movement shown in Fig. S3A, demonstrating
<1 mm of head movement]. This finding replicated previous
reports using normal subjects and corroborates a well-established
involvement of the human NAc during reward anticipation (18).
LFPs were recorded via an implanted quadripolar electrode
(3389; Medtronic) in the NAc, the location of which was defined
by merging a postoperative computed tomography scan of the
head to a preoperative 7-T MRI scan using gray matter nulled
sequences that indicate precise white matter–gray matter bound-
aries (Fig. 5D). Power spectral density analysis of NAc LFPs
during no reward and high reward anticipation (Fig. 5 E–H)
revealed an increase in delta power during the anticipation period
for high reward compared with no reward in the most ventral
channel [Fig. 5H: F(4,67) = 3.514, P < 0.05, post hoc: high reward
vs. baseline, P < 0.01; Tukey’s correction applied]. Head and limb
movement during intraoperative LFP recordings (Fig. S3B) in-
dicated that there was very little detectable movement. Compar-
ison of delta-power measurements during anticipation of high
punishments, low punishments, and low rewards normalized to
baseline revealed significant increase during anticipation of high
reward vs. low punishment (Fig. 5I and Fig. S4). We also in-
vestigated the correlation between NAc LFP and unit activity
during MID task, and found selective phase-locking of spikes to
the peak (phase 0) of the delta (2- to 3-Hz) oscillations (Fig. S5).
Discussion
We have demonstrated that anticipation of a large, HF food
reward increases delta oscillatory power in the NAc in mice, and
preliminary findings from a single human subject support the
translatability of this potential biomarker for RNS. In sated mice
exhibiting binge-eating behavior, strong delta oscillations are
detected 2 s before consuming food reward, but not before in-
take of house chow. This increase in delta power is not observed
before or during general locomotor behavior or social in-
teraction, and is positively correlated with unit activity in the
NAc. Using a threshold in delta-band power as a biomarker to
trigger delivery of a brief train of high-frequency electrical
stimulation pulses to the NAc resulted in significant attenuation

 of HF intake. The effectiveness of this RNS was reproducible
and behaviorally specific. Namely, utilizing power in the delta
band as a trigger for RNS did not interfere with social interaction
or locomotor behaviors. Moreover, the number of stimulation
bouts delivered during RNS was significantly lower than DBS to
achieve the same reduction in HF intake. Stimulation of the NAc
was not reinforcing or aversive as assayed by a real-time place
preference protocol, suggesting that stimulation-induced block-
ade of HF intake was not substituting for the anticipated food
reward or inducing an aversion. Post hoc review of stimulations
triggered during RNS revealed that our biomarker settings cor-
rectly anticipated about two-thirds of HF binge onsets, while
approximately one-quarter of the triggered stimulations were not
associated with subsequent binge onset.
To examine the translational potential of our findings, we
analyzed NAc LFPs during anticipation of monetary rewards in a
human, which, like HF in mice, demonstrably elicits vigorous
approach (10). The MID task was used here so that we could
examine the human NAc LFPs during a similar brief period of
reward anticipation that was studied in mice. Anticipation of
large financial incentives are known to reliably increase NAc
BOLD signal activity in healthy individuals (18). Because BOLD
activity has been reported to correlate with changes in LFPs (19,
20), we predicted that anticipation of large rewards would induce
measurable changes in LFPs in the NAc. Consistent with what is
commonly observed in healthy individuals, event-related fMRI in
a human subject suffering from severe obsessive-compulsive
disorder revealed increased NAc BOLD signal during anticipa-
tion of large rewards. Most importantly, NAc LFPs recorded
from this subject exhibited an increase in power in the delta band
during anticipation of high monetary rewards. These electro-
physiological changes echoed those seen in mice anticipating HF
reward and importantly was detected by a clinically approved
benchtop system. Moreover, the MID task is a good probe of
reward anticipation in that it increases positive arousal associ-
ated with monetary reward anticipation as has been demon-
strated in food reward studies in mice (21, 22).
The illustration of spike–field coupling in humans illustrates
that oscillations in the delta range, at the spatial scale of the LFP
measured by the high-impedance microelectrode (at ∼200 μm)
(23), influence the timing of action potentials in the ventral NAc,
although the DBS scale field potential recordings of power
change during the reward task (at ∼3.5 mm) (24) are not related
in any simple way to the spike field and may differ from the

 smaller scale LFP measured by the microelectrode. However, the
finding of spike–field coupling does establish the saliency of the
delta-range power as a marker of local computation. Together,
these findings demonstrate that NAc LFPs carry information
relevant to reward anticipation and have the potential to be used
as a neural electrographic biomarker to guide RNS treatment for
neuropsychiatric disorders exhibiting impulsivity.
RNS remains a therapeutic approach with which clinicians
have limited experience. For intractable temporal lobe epilepsy,
RNS has proven efficacious in reducing seizure frequency and
severity with outcomes that are not only durable but also im-
prove over time (25). Several lines of evidence also suggest that
responsive or closed-loop DBS using power in the beta band
detected in the subthalamic nucleus across species may be su-
perior to traditional continuous DBS for Parkinson’s disease
treatment (26–29). Moreover, closed-loop neurostimulation
strategies have exhibited promise for other neuropsychiatric
diseases, demonstrating the broad potential for this line of re-
search (30).
Our findings provide preliminary evidence that RNS has po-
tential for treating intractable behavioral disorders that have not
previously been considered optimal candidates for neurosurgical
approaches, including eating disorders, and even obesity and
addiction. Undoubtedly, further work will optimize biomarkers
of reward anticipation by improving their specificity and sensi-
tivity. We used chow as the primary food control in our study,
and social interaction as another behavioral control as this is
considered an assay of reward processing in mice. The conse-
quences of exposure to other appetitive stimuli, such as drugs of
abuse or sexually receptive partners, will be important to ex-
amine to better define the specificity of the LFP biomarkers
reported here. Clearly, many more experiments in both animals
and humans will be necessary to minimize potential side effects
of RNS and maximize its therapeutic utility. Nevertheless, the
fact that mouse and human NAc LFPs exhibit similar changes
during reward anticipation suggests that mechanistically driven
research in rodents can inform what is eventually done in human
subjects. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that the candidate
biomarker can be detected using an off-the-shelf, commercially
available RNS device, suggesting that rapid progress can be
made toward a neurostimulation treatment for patients suffering
from intractable, life-threatening impulse control disorders. As
human trials are undertaken for novel behavioral indications,
systematic plans for monitoring patient subjects by a multidisci-
plinary team will be critical to best assay the future potential of
this intervention.
