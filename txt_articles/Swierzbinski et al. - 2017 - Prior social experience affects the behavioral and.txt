ABSTRACT
The effects of alcohol on society can be devastating, both as an
immediate consequence of acute intoxication and as a powerful drug
of abuse. However, the neurocellular mechanisms of alcohol
intoxication
are
still
elusive,
partly
because
of
the
complex
interactions between alcohol and nervous system function. We
found that juvenile crayfish are behaviorally sensitive to acute
alcohol exposure and progress through stages that are strikingly
similar
to
those
of
most
other
intoxicated
organisms.
Most
surprisingly, we found that the social history of the animals
significantly modified the acute effects of alcohol. Crayfish taken
from a rich social environment became intoxicated more rapidly than
animals that were socially isolated before alcohol exposure. In
addition, we found that the modulation of intoxicated behaviors by
prior social experience was paralleled on the level of individual
neurons. These results significantly improve our understanding of the
mechanisms underlying the interplay between social experience,
alcohol intoxication and nervous system function.

INTRODUCTION
Although alcohol is a widely used drug with significant behavioral,
health and economic impacts, the cellular mechanisms of alcohol
intoxication are still elusive. While other drugs of abuse have
specific receptors in the brain, alcohol does not, but instead exerts its
effects by targeting multiple neurotransmitter systems, including
serotonin and GABA (Mehta and Ticku, 1988; Mihic et al., 1997;
Barr et al., 2003; Wolf and Heberlein, 2003; Ferraz and Boerngen-
Lacerda, 2008; Lobo and Harris, 2008; Kumar et al., 2009).
Behavioral effects of ethanol (EtOH) exposure are conserved across
many different species and typically consist of a period of
disinhibition or an increase in activity, followed by loss of motor
coordination and postural control (Moore et al., 1998; Vonghia
et al., 2008; Robinson and Atkinson, 2013). Existing research on the
interconnection between alcohol and social experience has largely
focused on how alcohol alters various social behaviors that range
from dance communication in honeybees to aggression in humans
(Bozic et al., 2006; Heinz et al., 2011). In addition, other studies
investigated how alcohol consumption is mediated by social factors;
for example, subordinate rats and monkeys have been shown to
consume significantly more alcohol than dominants (Blanchard
et al., 1987; McKenzie-Quirk and Miczek, 2008), and rats and
monkeys that were socially deprived (e.g. by housing them
individually) also consumed more alcohol compared with animals
housed in groups (Wolffgramm and Heyne, 1991; Helms et al.,
2012). However, our understanding of the underlying mechanisms
is still very limited, and it was recently suggested that in order to
improve clinical relevance of addiction science, future studies
should focus more specifically on the role of social context
including factors such as social exclusion (Heilig et al., 2016). Yet,
despite extensive literature in the field of alcohol research, the vast
majority of publications focus on the effects of social mediators on
drinking behavior, whereas the opposite, i.e. whether (and how) past
social experience might shape the neurobehavioral effects of acute
alcohol exposure, is significantly understudied.
Prior work using invertebrates as models for addiction research
has been very productive (Søvik and Barron, 2013). The behavioral
effect of acute (as well as repeated and chronic) EtOH exposure has
been well characterized in Drosophila melanogaster, which exhibits
behavioral alterations that are similar to those of humans (Wolf and
Heberlein, 2003). Using powerful genetic approaches in this model
revealed some of the genes and neurochemical components
correlated with the behavioral responses to alcohol; however,
identification of the underlying cellular–molecular mechanisms has
been less successful (Kong et al., 2010; Rodan and Rothenfluh,
2010).
Among invertebrates, the suitability of crayfish as a model for
studying the effects of drugs of abuse has also been demonstrated.
Crayfish experience discrete behavioral changes in response to
several widely abused drugs (e.g. amphetamines and cocaine) that
are similar to those seen in vertebrates (Panksepp and Huber, 2004).
In addition, crayfish that were chronically exposed to alcohol in the
surrounding water exhibited tolerance; the inability to quickly right
themselves after being turned on their back resumed normal
functioning after 2 weeks of continuous exposure (Friedman et al.,
1988). Other studies of chronic alcohol exposure in crayfish found
that
hemolymph
(i.e.
blood)
alcohol
concentration
reached
approximately 10% of the bath concentrations after 2 h of
exposure, and alcohol-induced behavioral effects were observed at
a blood alcohol content similar to that found for other organisms,
including humans (Macmillan et al., 1991; Hausknecht et al., 1992).
In the current study, we expanded on these studies, and – for the
first time – investigated the role of social experience on the
behavioral and neurophysiological sensitivity to acute EtOH
exposure in juvenile crayfish.

 (76×30×30 cm L:W:H) with 50–100 crayfish until the day of the
experiment (Com group) or before they were placed in social
isolation (Iso group) for 7–10 days prior to testing. The bottom of
communal tanks was filled with ∼2 cm of gravel, which
provided small hiding places, and the water was constantly
circulated and filtered using an aquarium pump (Tetra Spectrum
Brands, Blacksburg, VA, USA). The small isolation tanks
(15×8×10 cm L:W:H) were equipped with air stones for water
oxygenation
(BubbleMac
Industries,
McAlpin,
FL,
USA).
Both Com and Iso groups were housed on a 12 h:12 h light:dark
schedule at a constant temperature of 22±1.5°C. Com animals were
fed shrimp pellets (Aqua Pets Americas, Salt Lake City, UT, USA)
ad libitum twice weekly and Iso animals were fed one shrimp
pellet on the day of isolation. Only animals that showed no signs of
major bodily injury (i.e. both claws and at least six walking legs
intact) and had not molted within 2 days prior to experiments were
used. Com crayfish were taken directly from a communal tank with
a fish net, weighed on a laboratory scale, and measured with a ruler.
Iso crayfish were measured and weighed following isolation before
the experiment was performed. After measurements were taken,
each individual crayfish was immediately transferred to the
experimental (i.e. alcohol-containing) tank. All experiments were
performed at about the same time of day and each animal was only
used once.
Freely behaving animals
EtOH baths were created on test day using 100% ethyl alcohol
(Ethyl Alcohol 200 Proof, Pharmco-Aaper, Brookfield, CT, USA)
and deionized water. Both behavioral and implanted electrode
experiments
were
performed
in
500 ml
water
in
tanks
(15×8×10 cm). The light in the experimental room was kept
constant and disturbance in the room was kept to a minimum.
A digital video camera (Canon XL1-S, Canon, Tokyo, Japan)
was used for all video recordings. The camera faced the long side of
the tank to allow full view of the animal’s behavior. Recording was
started before the crayfish was placed gently into the tank using a
fish net. The camera was connected to a monitor (20 in; Sony
WEGA, Sony, Tokyo, Japan) to observe the animal’s behavior from
a distance, and data were stored in S-VHS format. Tapes were later
reviewed (by different experimenters) on a large TV monitor (27 in;
Sony WEGA) using single-frame video analysis.
The effects of different EtOH concentrations on the behavior of
Com crayfish were measured by immersing animals, of similar body
size and mass (mean±s.d.), in 0.1 mol l−1 EtOH (N=15, 3.25±
0.08 cm, 0.84±0.02 g), 0.5 mol l−1 EtOH (N=16, 3.19±0.09 cm,
0.85±0.02 g) or 1 mol l−1 EtOH (N=24, 3.30±0.17 cm, 0.86±
0.07 g) and video recording for up to 180 min to capture all
intoxicated behaviors. Iso animals (N=20, 3.29±0.17 cm, 0.81±
0.13 g) were tested in 1 mol l−1 EtOH only using the same
experimental protocol and results were compared with those for
Com crayfish exposed to the same EtOH concentration. For both sets
of experiments, the starting time (‘onset’) of different intoxicated
behavior was measured in minutes after the start of the trial for each
animal after reviewing the video recordings. The onset of tail-flipping
was determined as the first occurrence of a tail-flip (which was always
followed by additional tail-flips), and supine posture was measured
when the animal first landed on its back and was unable to
immediately right itself. At the end of the experimental period (either
after 180 min of recording or when the animals remained on their
backs for several minutes), the animals were transferred into a new
tank with fresh deionized water. Animals displayed normal behaviors
after a couple of hours in the new tank.
Threshold tracking
Lateral giant interneuron (LG) threshold tracking in freely behaving
crayfish using implanted wire electrodes was performed in groups
of Com and Iso animals of similar size and mass (Com: N=11, 3.95±
0.18 cm, 1.26±0.21 g; Iso: N=11, 3.85±0.23 cm, 1.30±0.15 g). All
crayfish were anesthetized on ice for 15 min before surgery. A pair
of stimulating electrodes was made from insulated silver wire (A-M
Systems, Sequim, WA, USA). The insulation on the end was
stripped to expose approximately 5 mm of bare wire (0.127 mm
diameter). Under a microscope, small holes were made through the
soft membrane on the ventral side of the abdomen close to the last
abdominal (A6) ganglion using steel insect pins. Electrodes were
carefully inserted into these holes to make contact with the
ipsilateral sensory nerves (N2–5) that connect to A6. Once in
place, electrode wires were glued (Loctite Super Glue Gel, Loctite,
Düsseldorf, Germany) onto the hard exoskeleton near the insertion
area. Crayfish (Com or Iso) were then placed in a tank (15×8×10 cm
L:W:H) of 500 ml de-ionized water and electrode wires were
connected to a pulse stimulator (Isolated Pulse Stimulator 2100, A-
M Systems), which allowed for varying amounts of constant voltage
to be applied to the sensory afferents.
After a period of recovery from surgery and acclimation, the
activation threshold for the LG was found by increasing the
stimulating voltage by 0.3 V from a 1 V starting voltage until a
stereotyped LG tail-flip was produced. After a 15 min acclimation
period, 1 h of LG threshold tracking began; if the animal tail-
flipped, the voltage was reduced by 0.3 V and this new stimulus was
presented after a 2 min inter-stimulus interval. If the animal did not
tail-flip in response to the stimulus, the voltage was increased by
0.3 V. The voltage and corresponding behavior were recorded on
paper and used for later analysis. After 1 h of threshold tracking in
water, the animal was given a 15 min resting period before 1 h of
threshold tracking in 1 mol l−1 EtOH began. To create the EtOH
bath, 23 g of 100% EtOH was added to the tank and the solution was
stirred using a pipette without contacting or disturbing the animal.
Stimuli were presented as before (in water) with each animal
receiving 30 stimuli over the course of 1 h. After the experiment
concluded, animals were removed from the EtOH bath, wires were
cut, and animals were returned to individual holding tanks. Most
animals recovered and lost the remaining wire tips during the next
molt.
Intracellular recordings
EtOH was mixed with normal crayfish saline (mmol l−1: 202 NaCl,
5.37 KCl, 13.53 CaCl2, 2.6 MgCl2 and 2.4 Hepes). Saline and EtOH
saline solutions were superfused over the preparation (see below) at
a rate of 5 ml min−1 using a Baxter flow control device (Baxter
International Inc., Deerfield, IL, USA). Flow rate was verified
before each experiment. Excess fluid was removed from the dish
(40 ml volume) using a peristaltic pump (Thermo Scientific FH100
Series, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). All
experimental preparations experienced 10 min superfusion of
crayfish saline (baseline), 60 min of EtOH exposure at different
concentrations, and 60 min of washout with crayfish saline.
Intracellular glass electrodes were pulled from glass capillary
tubes with filaments (World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL,
USA; outer diameter: 1 mm, inner diameter: 0.58 mm) using a
Sutter micropipette puller (Sutter Instruments, Novato, CA, USA)
and backfilled with 2 mol l−1 potassium acetate (CH3CO2K).
Electrodes had resistances measuring between 20 and 35 MΩ. LG
axons were impaled immediately rostral to the terminal abdominal
ganglion (A6). Teflon-coated silver hook electrodes (uncoated

 diameter 0.127 mm) were placed on ipsilateral nerve roots 2–5 of
A6. A second extracellular hook was placed more rostral on the
ventral nerve cord to record activity of other ascending interneurons
and to verify successful impalement of the LG.
Stimuli were presented with an inter-stimulus interval of 90 s and
LG threshold was verified to be at a consistent voltage for 10 min
during saline superfusion. The stimulus was reduced to 0.2 V below
threshold before EtOH superfusion was started. The preparations
were exposed to crayfish saline (controls), 20 mmol l−1 EtOH or
100 mmol l−1 EtOH. During the 60 min of EtOH exposure, the
preparation received 40 stimuli and the total number of evoked LG
action potentials was recorded. Electrophysiology data were
collected
using microelectrode
amplifiers (Axoclamp
900A,
Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA), an A-M systems
differential amplifier (Model 1700) and a Grass stimulator (Model
S88, Natus Medical Incorporated, Pleasanton, CA, USA) for
recording and stimulation using extracellular hook electrodes. A
Digidata 1440A (Molecular Devices) was used to digitize analog
data. Data were recorded and stored using pClamp 10.4 and
Clampfit 10.4 software (Molecular Devices). All electrophysiological
recordings were performed in a grounded faraday cage.
For intracellular experiments involving semi-intact preparations,
Com or Iso crayfish were pinned down dorsal-side up in a Sylgard-
lined dish. The dorsal cuticle and most of the muscles of the
abdomen were removed to provide access to the ventral nerve cord
and the dorsal LG neurons. The head and thorax were left intact and
connected to the abdomen. Com and Iso animals of similar size were
used for all experiments: 20 mmol l−1 EtOH (Com: N=7, 3.46±
0.29 cm; Iso: N=5, 3.58±0.13 cm) and 100 mmol l−1 EtOH (Com:
N=7, 3.53±0.29 cm; Iso: N=6, 3.73±0.23 cm).
For intracellular experiments involving reduced tail preparations,
the animals were prepared as described for semi-intact preparations
except the abdomen was surgically removed from the head and
thorax. Com and Iso animals of similar size were used for all
experiments: 20 mmol l−1 EtOH (Com: N=6, 3.65±0.14 cm; Iso:
N=6, 3.7±0.2 cm) and 100 mmol l−1 EtOH (Com: N=6, 3.65±
0.21 cm; Iso: N=6, 3.68±0.18 cm).
Control animals for semi-intact preparations (Com: N=5, 3.76±
0.15 cm; Iso: N=6, 3.63±0.16 cm) and tail preparations (Com: N=4,
3.65±0.1 cm; Iso: N=4, 3.68±0.24 cm) were exposed to 1 h of
normal crayfish saline instead of EtOH.
Statistical analysis
IBM SPSS Statistics v23 (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA) was used for all
statistical tests. All applied statistical tests and corresponding test
results are described in the text.
RESULTS
To study the acute effects of alcohol on crayfish natural behavior,
we observed juvenile crayfish in an aquarium that was filled with
EtOH solutions of different concentrations. After the animals were
placed into the EtOH bath, their behaviors were recorded and later
quantified using single-frame video analysis. Three discrete and
unique behaviors following intoxication not typically observed in
unexposed crayfish were readily identified as long as the EtOH
concentration of the bath was high enough (Fig. S1 and Movie 1).
The first behavior was an elevated stance with fully extended
walking legs and upheld abdomen that lasted for a few seconds. The
next (and more dramatic) change occurred when animals started to
produce spontaneous tail-flips, i.e. short swimming sequences
mediated by rapid flexions of the abdomen. The final behavioral
change was characterized by loss of motor coordination when
crayfish fell on their back (into a supine position) and had difficulty
returning to an upright posture. These discretely observed
behavioral alterations expressed by crayfish in the EtOH bath
indicate that internal alcohol levels rise over time and lead to
increased behavioral excitability followed by behavioral inhibition,
a typical pattern observed in most organisms after alcohol
consumption
(e.g.
Oscar-Berman
and
Marinkovic,
2007).
Interestingly, the EtOH-mediated elevated posture (stance) closely
resembled the ‘aggressive posture’ that has previously been
described
in
crayfish
after
systemic
injection
of
serotonin
(Livingstone et al., 1980). This may suggest that some of the
early EtOH-induced effects we observed could be mediated through
interactions between alcohol and the serotonergic system.
Our subsequent detailed behavioral analysis focused on only two
behavioral changes (tail-flipping and supine position) because they
were easily and unambiguously identifiable in all trials. We first
tested the effects of three different EtOH concentrations (0.1, 0.5
and 1 mol l−1) in the bath and found that EtOH-induced behaviors
were expressed in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. S2).
While animals that were exposed to 1 mol l−1 EtOH (N=24)
experienced spontaneous, unprovoked tail-flipping on average after
20.1±0.8 min (mean±s.e.m.), animals in 0.5 mol l−1 EtOH (N=16)
required more than twice the amount of time (45.6±2.6 min), and
crayfish exposed to 0.1 mol l−1 EtOH (N=15) showed an even
greater response delay (106.4±18.2 min). The measured behavioral
response latencies of all three groups (1, 0.5 and 0.1 mol l−1) were
significantly different (Kruskal–Wallis test, P<0.01). Interestingly,
in the group exposed to 0.1 mol l−1 EtOH, nine individuals never
produced tail-flips during the 3 h recording period, suggesting they
never reached the level of intoxication needed to elicit this behavior.
A similar picture emerged when latencies for supine position
were quantified. Animals in 1 mol l−1 EtOH first landed on their
backs after 35.9±1.6 min, but this occurred significantly later
in 0.5 mol l−1 EtOH (71.9±3.8 min). The latencies for the 1 and
0.5 mol l−1 groups were significantly different (Mann–Whitney
U-test, P<0.01). Only three of all tested individuals placed into the
lowest concentration (0.1 mol l−1) EtOH bath displayed a supine
position during the 3 h recording period and after much longer
latencies (162.2±5.8 min).
As all tested crayfish were taken from a communal tank where
they were housed for several weeks with a large number (50–100) of
conspecifics, we next investigated whether animals deprived of
social contact would produce spontaneous tail-flips and supine
position at similar latencies after EtOH exposure (Fig. 1).
Animals were individually isolated for 1 week (Iso group) and
tested in a 1 mol l−1 EtOH bath (N=19); these Iso animals were of
equal size and mass to animals that had been communally housed
(Com animals). Iso crayfish began showing spontaneous tail-flips
on average after 28.4±1.8 min, which is approximately 8 min later
and statistically different from Com crayfish (Mann–Whitney
U-test, P<0.01). Iso crayfish also experienced supine position
significantly (approximately 7 min) later than Com crayfish (43.1±
1.9 min; Mann–Whitney U-test, P<0.01). This result indicates that
crayfish from an environment that provides opportunities for
frequent interactions with other conspecifics are more sensitive to
acute alcohol exposure than animals that are depleted of any social
interactions for 1 week.
Next, we investigated whether the social effects on the interplay
between EtOH and behavior were paralleled at the level of the
nervous system. As the neural circuits underlying tail-flipping
behavior in crayfish have been intensively investigated for years, are
well understood and are easily accessible (Edwards et al., 1999;
1518

Journal of Experimental Biology
 Herberholz et al., 2002), we first focused on changes in circuit
activation expressed in freely behaving animals. We implanted a
pair of fine silver wires into the abdomen of both Iso (N=11) and
Com crayfish (N=11) of equal size and mass, and measured changes
in the excitability of the LG after exposure to 1 mol l−1 EtOH. A
single action potential in LG is known to produce a tail-flip response
in crayfish, and the LG neurons can be activated with sufficient
sensory input from tail afferents in freely behaving animals (Yeh
et al., 1996; Krasne et al., 1997). Wires were placed above the
sensory nerves of the last abdominal ganglion (A6), and afferents
providing sensory input to the LG neuron were stimulated every
2 min with electric shocks. By varying the intensity of the shock just
below and just above LG threshold depending on whether the
animals tail-flipped or not, we were able to track LG thresholds for
1 h in water and for another hour in EtOH. Over the first hour in
water, we observed slight fluctuations in LG circuit excitability,
with most Iso crayfish showing a minor increase and most Com
crayfish showing a minor decrease in excitability at the end of the
first hour when compared with the normalized starting threshold of
100% (Fig. S3). Although the difference was not significant
between the two groups, the slight decrease in LG excitability seen
in Com animals during the last 10 min of testing in water (104.1±
8%) matches results from an earlier study that used a similar method
and reported slight increases in LG threshold over time in socially
experienced (dominant and subordinate) crayfish (Krasne et al.,
1997). However, we also found that LG circuit excitability increased
in Iso animals during the last 10 min of the first hour in water (91.1±
3.6%), which is a new observation that warrants future investigation
and will be discussed again below.
Following exposure to 1 mol l−1 EtOH, the LG threshold
substantially decreased in both Iso and Com crayfish, indicating
that EtOH enhanced the excitability of the LG tail-flip circuit in both
animal groups (Fig. 2). In addition, we found that LG threshold
decreased more strongly and more quickly in Com than in Iso
animals, thus indicating higher neural sensitivity to EtOH in
communally
housed
crayfish
and
paralleling
our
previous
behavioral results. This shows that the observed differences in
behavioral responses of Com and Iso crayfish to EtOH exposure are
paralleled by differences in neural circuit excitability.
We then wanted to know whether these socially mediated effects
could be observed at the level of a single neuron. We measured
intracellular LG threshold changes after EtOH exposure using
single-cell electrophysiology in semi-intact preparations. We
selected Com and Iso animals as described above and recorded
LG activity in the abdomen of mostly intact animals that were
pinned down in a Petri dish. The LG neuron was impaled with a fine
glass electrode and sensory afferents were stimulated with silver
hook electrodes. Using a superfusion system, preparations were
exposed to two different concentrations of EtOH (20 and
100 mmol l−1) that we estimated to be similar to low and high
internal concentrations experienced in our experiments with freely
behaving animals. To measure changes in LG excitability, the
sensory stimulus was set at a voltage that produced a sizable
excitatory postsynaptic potential in LG, but was below threshold.
We recorded baseline for 10 min at an inter-stimulus interval of 90 s
(with no action potentials observed) and continued the stimulation
while EtOH was superfused into the dish and onto the preparation
for 1 h (40 stimuli total). This was then followed by a 60 min
washout with fresh saline.
Both Iso (N=11) and Com animals (N=14) of equal size were
tested. We found that the effect of previous social experience on LG
excitability was preserved in these recordings of semi-intact
preparations. LG
was brought to threshold in more Com
preparations (79%) than Iso preparations (55%) (Fig. 3A), but the
largest difference in activated preparations and corresponding LG
excitability (i.e. evoked action potentials) was observed with
20 mmol l−1 EtOH (Fig. 3B). In fact, fewer Com preparations
were activated by 100 mmol l−1 EtOH than by 20 mmol l−1 EtOH,
and they produced fewer LG action potentials (20 mmol l−1: 19.7±
6.17, 100 mmol l−1: 12.43±4.75), indicating that this EtOH
concentration may have resulted in a combination of excitatory
and inhibitory effects. This was not the case for Iso preparations,
however, where higher EtOH concentration generated more activity
(20 mmol l−1: 8.2±7.24, 100 mmol l−1:16.67±6.0). Washout with
normal crayfish saline did not change the number of observed action
potentials significantly (Wilcoxon signed-rank test, P>0.05) for

the onset of spontaneous tail-flipping behavior and the first occurrence of the
crayfish in a supine position was measured (mean±s.e.m) after exposure to
1 mol l−1 ethanol (EtOH) in the water. Comparison of behavioral response

in crayfish with recent social experience (Com; N=24) than in socially isolated
animals (Iso; N=20) for both tail-flip (Mann–Whitney U-test, **P<0.01) and

 Com crayfish (20 mmol l−1: 25.57±7.26, 100 mmol l−1: 16.33±7.2)
or Iso crayfish (20 mmol l−1: 8.2±7.95, 100 mmol l−1: 10.5±6.17).
The resilience of LG to saline washout has also been shown in other
studies following exposure to different neuropharmacological
agents such as serotonin and picrotoxin (Yeh et al., 1996; Vu
et al., 1997).
As the difference between Com and Iso preparations was most
apparent in the 20 mmol l−1 EtOH condition, we measured whether
this difference was expressed at different time points over the course
of the 1 h of EtOH exposure. We counted the average number of
action potentials of Com (N=7) and Iso preparations (N=5) in
15 min intervals during EtOH exposure. We found that the number
of action potentials increased for each 15 min interval for Com
preparations, and it was significantly different from baseline at the
first and last two time intervals (Wilcoxon signed-rank test, P<0.05
for each time interval). However, no significant increase in the
average number of LG action potentials was found for any time
point in Iso preparations (Fig. 4). Thus, 20 mmol l−1 EtOH elicited a
strong excitatory effect in Com preparations, and this effect became
more apparent as the concentration of EtOH increased.
This result shows that our observation of EtOH sensitivity in
freely behaving animals is paralleled at the single-neuron level.
Importantly, the effects of prior social experience on EtOH
sensitivity
are
present
in
an
identified
neural
circuit.
As
experiments in the semi-intact preparation are influenced by
descending inputs from the brain and thorax onto the local LG
circuit, and it has previously been shown that LG excitability is
modified by descending GABAergic tonic inhibition (Vu and
Krasne, 1993; Vu et al., 1993), we next investigated the effect of
EtOH on the LG circuit in an isolated tail preparation. We prepared
the animals in a similar way to the semi-intact preparations, but the
tail was separated from the thorax, removing any descending
neuronal inputs onto the local LG circuit. Stimulation of sensory
afferents and electrophysiological recordings were performed
identically to the semi-intact preparation experiment.
We repeated the protocol previously used for semi-intact
preparations, and measured LG action potentials in Com (N=6)
and Iso preparations (N=6) using the two different EtOH
concentrations (20 and 100 mmol l−1). Unlike in the semi-intact
experiment, where we found significant enhancement of excitability
in Com preparations with 20 mmol l−1 EtOH, only a small effect of
EtOH on LG excitability was observed when the rostral nervous
system was disconnected from the abdomen (Fig. 5A).
Moreover, the percentage of Com preparations (17%) and Iso
preparations (17%) that were activated by 20 mmol l−1 EtOH no
longer differed. There was also no significant difference in the
average number of LG action potentials evoked with this EtOH
concentration (Com: 0.17±0.17; Iso: 1.5±1.5). Thus, when we
compared the number of action potentials in tail preparations
with the previously recorded number for semi-intact preparations
at this concentration, we found that removal of descending inputs
from the brain and thorax caused a significant decrease in LG
excitability, but only in Com preparations (Mann–Whitney
U-test, P<0.05).
This suggests that preserving ‘normal’ descending inputs onto the
LG facilitates its sensitivity to EtOH, but more in Com than Iso
preparations. After superfusion of 100 mmol l−1 EtOH into the dish,
we observed more activated preparations, with slightly more for

 Com (67%) than for Iso (50%). In addition, although the difference
between Com and Iso preparations was not significant (Mann–
Whitney U-test, P>0.05), an effect of prior social experience on
EtOH sensitivity was observed at this higher EtOH concentration;
Com preparations (19.67±8.51) fired many more action potentials
than Iso preparations (3.5±2.08) in 100 mmol l−1 EtOH (Fig. 5B).
Washout with fresh saline reduced the number of action potentials in
Com (7.83±6.53) but not Iso preparations (7.17±6.58); however, the
difference was not significant (Wilcoxon signed-rank test, P>0.05).
This is similar to results from a previous study of LG excitability in
crayfish. Yeh et al. (1996) reported that washout of serotonin was
successful in preparations from animals following agonistic
pairings, but not in socially isolated animals.
Together, these results suggest that EtOH exerts both global and
local effects on LG excitability. The sensitivity to EtOH increases
when descending inputs from the brain are present, and the increase
is more pronounced in Com than in Iso crayfish. This result allows
us to speculate that EtOH might interact with the well-known brain-
derived GABAergic tonic inhibition that regulates LG excitability
in freely behaving animals (Krasne and Teshiba, 1995; Krasne and
Edwards, 2002), and differences in the GABAergic system brought
about by different social experiences mediate this effect. It does not
exclude other mechanisms, of course, and specifically interactions
of EtOH with other neurotransmitter systems, but this needs to be
investigated in future experiments.
Motivated by our finding regarding the suggested interplay
between social experience and brain-derived descending inputs
onto LG, we performed a final set of experiments to explore whether
descending neural inputs to the LG circuit would be present even in
the absence of alcohol exposure, and whether this effect might be
mediated by prior social experience. We superfused Com and Iso
preparations, both semi-intact (N=6 for both groups) and tail only
(N=4 for both groups), with crayfish saline for 1 h (i.e. replacing
EtOH with saline for the entire experiment) while recording
changes in excitability of the LG neuron. Interestingly, we found
that several semi-intact preparations (Com: 33%; Iso: 50%) with
intact descending inputs produced LG action potentials during the
1 h saline treatment (Com: 5.83±4.74; Iso: 9.83±5.58). However, in
tail preparations without any descending inputs to LG, only one Iso
preparation produced two action potentials during the entire hour of
saline treatment, and LG never reached threshold in any of the Com
preparations (Fig. S4). This shows that LG excitability increases
over time when the circuit is repeatedly stimulated and only saline is
superfused over the preparation; however, the increase is more
pronounced when descending inputs onto the local circuit are intact
and, most surprisingly, it is stronger in socially isolated animals than
in communally housed animals. It is notable that the increase in LG
excitability observed in Iso preparations in these experiments
mirrors our finding in freely behaving animals that LG became more
excitable in Iso animals after the first hour of stimulation in water
alone (i.e. before EtOH). This result is opposite to what we observed
after EtOH application: Com animals were more sensitive than Iso
animals to EtOH, suggesting that social effects on alcohol
intoxication are observed despite a naturally occurring tendency
of LG excitability to increase in socially isolated animals. Because
these differences were most pronounced in intact animals and semi-
intact preparations, they are most likely related to differences in
brain-derived descending inputs to the LG circuit. Although we
currently cannot fully explain this result, it is intriguing and warrants
further investigation.
DISCUSSION
We have shown here for the first time (to the best of our knowledge)
that the acute effects of alcohol on single neurons and corresponding
behavior are modulated by prior social experience. Our results
suggest that these differences are based on interactions of EtOH
with known neurotransmitter systems, possibly 5-HT and GABA.
Previous work in crayfish has shown that the effects of 5-HT on LG
excitability depend on the animal’s social status (Yeh et al., 1996),
and thus we hypothesize that exposure to different social
environments (communal housing versus social isolation) causes
lasting changes to neurotransmitter systems, possibly by altering
distributions of 5-HT and GABA receptors, and thereby creating
new or different targets for EtOH. Thus, acute alcohol exposure
affects individuals differently because their nervous system changes
according to their social environment, which alters the interactions
between alcohol, brain receptors, neural activity and corresponding
behavior.
Although crayfish are known to interact frequently with
conspecifics when housed in communal tanks, and they form
dominance relationships and social hierarchies through pairwise
agonistic encounters (e.g. Issa et al., 1999; Herberholz et al., 2007,
2016; Graham and Herberholz, 2009), we cannot exclude the
possibility that other factors, such as the difference in personal space
between communally housed and isolated animals, may have
contributed to our observed effects. For example, more crowded
conditions could have led to higher gill ventilation rates and thus

 higher alcohol intake in Com animals. This seems unlikely,
however, because Com and Iso animals were removed from their
respective tanks and behaviorally tested for EtOH effects in a new
tank under identical conditions, and ventilation rates in crayfish
return to baseline quickly after disturbance (Schapker et al., 2002).
Moreover, we obtained similar results in reduced preparations of
Com and Iso crayfish, including isolated nerve cords, which clearly
point toward neuronal changes underlying the difference between
the two groups. Nonetheless and despite the established relationship
between social
experience, neurotransmitter action
and
LG
excitability in crayfish, further experimentation is needed to
investigate other possible contributions to the observed behavioral
differences.
We do not yet know the exact neurocellular mechanisms of
interactions of EtOH with the LG circuit; however, the accessibility
of the circuit as well as its suitability for neurochemical
investigations makes the crayfish a great model for future alcohol
research. Our observation that EtOH exerts a local effect on the LG
is promising because the circuit is anatomically and functionally
fully characterized (e.g. Antonsen et al., 2005; Liu and Herberholz,
2010), and both the excitatory and inhibitory actions of alcohol can
be measured in one tractable circuit. Neurotransmitter systems such
as GABA and 5-HT are likely involved and their individual and
combined roles can be elucidated with neuropharmacological
manipulations. In addition, as the sensitivity to alcohol was
reduced after removal of descending inputs from the brain onto
the LG circuit, we can begin to form and test discrete hypotheses.
For example, it is possible that after removal of tonic descending
inhibition from the brain, GABA receptors on the LG become
available targets for alcohol, which leads to stronger inhibitory
effects. Thus, higher EtOH concentrations are needed to bring the
LG to threshold because alcohol-induced inhibition dominates its
excitatory effects under these conditions. As the socially mediated
differences were preserved in these experiments, (currently
unknown) alterations of GABA receptors in socially isolated and
socially experienced animals may at least in part be responsible for
this effect.
Although somewhat speculative at this point, it is tempting to
suggest that the reduced sensitivity to alcohol we observed in
socially isolated crayfish underlies the increase in drinking behavior
that has been widely reported in socially isolated mammalian
species (Wolffgramm and Heyne, 1991; Helms et al., 2012). If
social isolation causes a suppression of the alcohol-induced acute
neurobehavioral response, it would be reasonable to expect that
humans and non-human animals increase drinking after social
isolation (or ‘exclusion’) as a result of the lower sensitivity to the
cellular effects of alcohol. It is currently unclear whether our results
in crayfish generalize to neural circuits and corresponding behavior
in mammals, but they can certainly inform those studies, and in the
long term will hopefully contribute to the development of better
options
for
the
treatment
and
prevention
of
the
negative
consequences of alcohol abuse.
Although our current study was primarily concerned with the
effects of EtOH on tail-flip latencies and corresponding neural
circuitry, it has opened the door for investigation of other important
questions related to alcohol intoxication, e.g. its evolutionarily
conserved effects on locomotor behavior, learning and memory,
aggression, and decision making (Paulus and Geyer, 1997; Liden
et al., 2010; Alcaro et al., 2011; Luchiari et al., 2015). Lastly,
crayfish have been shown to exhibit behavioral manifestations such
as drug seeking, withdrawal, and tolerance related to other
substances of abuse (Huber et al., 2011), and thus additional
neurobehavioral experiments that extend beyond the acute effects of
alcohol exposure seem feasible. This is an exciting avenue for future
studies because of prior findings illustrating that differences in
sensitivity to acute alcohol consumption in humans strongly predict
later alcohol dependence (Mayfield et al., 2008).
