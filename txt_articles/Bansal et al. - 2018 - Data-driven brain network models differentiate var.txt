Abstract
The relationship between brain structure and function has been probed using a variety of
approaches, but how the underlying structural connectivity of the human brain drives behav-
ior is far from understood. To investigate the effect of anatomical brain organization on
human task performance, we use a data-driven computational modeling approach and
explore the functional effects of naturally occurring structural differences in brain networks.
We construct personalized brain network models by combining anatomical connectivity esti-
mated from diffusion spectrum imaging of individual subjects with a nonlinear model of brain
dynamics. By performing computational experiments in which we measure the excitability of
the global brain network and spread of synchronization following a targeted computational
stimulation, we quantify how individual variation in the underlying connectivity impacts both
local and global brain dynamics. We further relate the computational results to individual var-
iability in the subjects’ performance of three language-demanding tasks both before and
after transcranial magnetic stimulation to the left-inferior frontal gyrus. Our results show that
task performance correlates with either local or global measures of functional activity,
depending on the complexity of the task. By emphasizing differences in the underlying struc-
tural connectivity, our model serves as a powerful tool to assess individual differences in
task performances, to dissociate the effect of targeted stimulation in tasks that differ in cog-
nitive demand, and to pave the way for the development of personalized therapeutics.

 Author summary
How the organization of the brain drives human behavior is an important but open ques-
tion in neuroscience. Recent advances in non-invasive imaging techniques and analytical
tools allow one to build personalized brain network models that simulate an individual’s
brain activity based on the underlying anatomical connectivity. Here, we use these
computational models to perform virtual experiments in order to understand individual
performance of three different language-demanding tasks. For each individual, we build a
subject-specific brain network model and measure the global brain activation and patterns
of synchronized activity after a targeted computational stimulation. We find that depend-
ing on the complexity and type of the language task performed, either global or local mea-
sures of brain dynamics correlate with individual performance. By emphasizing
individual differences in human brain structure, the model serves as a powerful tool to
understand cognitive task performance and to promote the development of personalized
therapeutics.
Introduction
Cognitive responses and human behavior have been hypothesized to be the outcome of com-
plex interactions between regional populations of neurons [1, 2] and show significant variabil-
ity across individuals. While certain patterns of brain activity are robust [3], many patterns
change with learning and aging [4–8], and an underlying inter-subject variability in neural
activity has been observed [9–13]. Importantly, the underlying anatomical connectivity of the
brain provides a crucial backbone that drives neuronal dynamics and thus behavior [4, 14, 15].
Given recent and ongoing advancements in imaging techniques, such as diffusion spectrum
imaging (DSI), which estimates the presence of white matter tracts connecting brain regions,
mesoscale maps of anatomical brain connectivity can now be obtained [14, 16]. While differ-
ences in brain connectivity have long been known to exist between diseased and healthy popu-
lations [17–19], recent findings indicate measurable differences in patterns of white matter
connectivity across healthy individuals [20–23]. Although work is beginning to link individual
variability in white matter structure, functional activity, and task performance [24–30], there is
currently no standard methodology for evaluating the interplay between the brain’s structural
topology, dynamics, and function, and many open questions remain about how these features
are coupled.
The new field of network neuroscience [31] provides a coherent framework in which to
model and investigate this coupling. In the context of modeling human brain networks, net-
work nodes can be chosen to represent brain regions and network edges can represent either
physical connections (anatomical networks) or statistical relationships between nodal dynam-
ics (functional networks) [17, 31, 32]. Analytical tools from network science have been success-
fully utilized to quantify both structural and functional brain network organization and to gain
insight into topics as diverse as brain development [33], disease states [18, 19, 34], learning [4],
and intelligence [35].
Combining a network representation of the brain with computational modeling of brain
dynamics allows one to further investigate the links between brain structure, dynamics, and
performance by providing a controlled environment in which to perform in silico experiments
and make predictions about real-world brain function. Using experimentally obtained struc-
tural brain network data combined with biologically motivated computational models of brain
dynamics [36], one can build personalized brain network models of human brain activity [37–

 39]. This modeling approach has been used to gain insight into structure-function relation-
ships in disease populations [40, 41], perform virtual lesioning or resection experiments [42–
44], and assess the differential impact of stimulation to different brain regions [45, 46].
Here, we use this data-driven modeling approach to investigate the interplay between struc-
tural variation, brain activity, and task performance. Our computational model is built upon
subject-specific connectomes that are combined with biologically informed Wilson-Cowan
nonlinear oscillators (WCOs) [47, 48] to produce simulated patterns of personalized brain
activity. Additionally, this controlled computational environment allows us to perform tar-
geted stimulation experiments—motivated by actual laboratory experiments—and quantify
the emerging neural activity patterns that represent both global brain network activation and
task-specific local subnetwork activation. Using this model, we construct computational mea-
sures in order to relate structure and individual performance variability across a cohort of ten
healthy individuals who performed three language-demanding cognitive tasks before and after
transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) [49] targeted at the left inferior frontal gyrus (L-IFG)
of the brain. The performed tasks involved verb generation, sentence completion, and number
reading, and are known to vary in their cognitive complexity [50, 51].
Based upon the patterns of simulated brain activity driven by the structural networks in our
model, we find that task performance can be correlated with either local or global circuitry
depending on the complexity of the task. Further, we observe that, post experimentally applied
TMS, the correlation between model output and task performance is weakened. Finally, we
show that the eigenspectrum of the observed structural brain networks plays a key role in
global brain dynamics which can additionally provide predictive insight into performance of
some, but not all, tasks. Taken together, our results reveal that using personalized brain net-
work models to simulate brain dynamics provides an important tool for studying and under-
standing human performance in cognitively demanding tasks and represents an important
step towards the development of personalized therapeutics.
Results
In order to assess the link between variability in brain connectivity, activity patterns, and
behavior, we build data-driven personalized brain network models of ten individuals who per-
formed three language-demanding cognitive tasks before and after TMS targeted at the L-IFG
(see Materials and methods). Subject-specific anatomical connectivity was derived from DSI
imaging data, combined with a brain parcellation scheme based on the Lausanne atlas [52]
(Fig 1a). We studied two different resolutions scales of the Lausanne atlas that parcellate the
brain into either 83 or 234 regions (see Material and methods). In the main text, we present
our findings using the 234-region parcellation and include the 83-region results in the Sup-
porting Information, as the findings were largely preserved across scales. In Fig 1b, we present
the structural (anatomical) network of an individual as a weighted connectivity matrix whose
entries represent the strength of the connection between two brain regions. The dynamics of
each brain region are modeled using nonlinear Wilson-Cowan oscillators (WCOs), coupled
through a subject-specific anatomical brain network (Materials and methods). A WCO is a
biologically motivated model of local brain activity, developed to describe the mean behavior
of small neuronal populations [47]. The model therefore simulates a specific individual’s spa-
tiotemporal macro-level brain activity.
By holding the mathematical modeling of regional brain dynamics constant across individu-
als but allowing the underlying (subject-specific) structural connectivity matrix, A, to vary, the
model provides a causal link between differences in the structural organization of the brain and
differences in the resulting simulated brain dynamics. The global strength of the coupling

 between different brain regions via A is controlled by a global coupling parameter (c5; Materials
and methods). The dynamical state of the brain can be tuned by varying this parameter as
shown in Fig 1c, which depicts the average excitatory dynamics as a function of global coupling.
When the global coupling parameter exceeds a threshold value (cT
5 ), the brain dynamics
abruptly transition to an active state that is characterized by the oscillatory activity of Fig 1d.
Mathematically, this equates to oscillators switching from hovering near a fixed point to jump-
ing to a limit cycle. (See [45] for more details about this transition.) Previous work has shown
that the computational model is particularly sensitive to the point at which model dynamics
undergo this transition: the value of cT
5 at which the transition takes places is subject-specific,
and the inter-subject variability in cT
5 is greater than that seen using anatomical networks
derived from different scans of the same individual [45]. The transition value cT
5 can be thought
of as a proxy for the global excitability of the brain. Brains with a lower transition value require
less external input (e.g. stimulation) to the system to enter the active state, whereas brains with

 a higher transition value require greater external input to enter the active state. Here, we use
this as a parameter to measure differences in global network dynamics between individuals.
Individual variability: Model and experiments
Because we are interested in linking variability in brain structure and behavior, we first mea-
sured the extent of individual variability in anatomical connectivity, simulated brain activity,
and task performance in our data set. Across our cohort of subjects, we observed measurable
variability in anatomical network structure as seen in Fig 2a, which shows the standard devia-
tion in edge weights between two brain regions, normalized by the mean edge weight. This
structural variability is also manifested in the simulated brain activity depicted in Fig 2b and
2c. We observe variability across individuals in the specific patterns of brain activity in the
active state (Fig 2b) as well as in the transition values (cT
5) (Fig 2c). Since the nonlinear WCOs
are all identical in the model, these observed differences in simulated brain activity are a direct
result of variation in the underlying anatomical connectivity. In Fig 2d we show the spatial
map of the average regional variability in structural connectivity and functional activity across
Fig 2. Assessing variability in structure, dynamics, and performance. (a) Variability in the connection strengths between pairs of brain regions
across ten subjects, measured as the standard deviation of edge weights between brain regions across individuals, normalized by the mean of edge
weights. Although there are few regions of low variability (blue), there are a significant number of regions with moderate to high variability
(green to yellow). (b) Spatial patterns of excitatory activity vary across individuals due to regional variations in the structural connectivity
between subjects. Each column represents the temporal average of the excitatory activity across brain regions for a given individual in the excited
state and is unique in terms of the overall activity pattern. (c) The global coupling transition value (cT
5 ) also varies across our cohort of ten
individuals. (d) Spatial mapping of the average variability in structural connectivity and functional activity across individuals. (e) Cognitive task
performance for the ten subjects was assessed by experimentally measuring the response times for three language-demanding tasks: verb
generation (VG), sentence completion (SC), and number reading (NR), both before (filled symbols) and after (open symbols) a targeted
transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to the left-inferior frontal gyrus (L-IFG) of the brain.

 individuals. Interestingly, we observe a diverse range of regional variation in functional
dynamics that does not necessarily match the pattern or level of structural variation.
Finally, we assessed the extent of variability in the cognitive performances of individuals
across three language-demanding tasks: (i) verb-generation (VG); (ii) sentence-completion
(SC); and (iii) number-reading (NR). Performance was measured as the median response time
across multiple (~50) trials (see Materials and methods) and shows variability across both sub-
jects and tasks (Fig 2e). Moreover, performances were altered after transcranial magnetic stim-
ulation (TMS) was applied to the left inferior frontal gyrus (L-IFG). The L-IFG, also known as
Broca’s area, is traditionally believed to play an important role in language comprehension and
syntactic processing, and specifically in the selection and retrieval of words [53]. It is therefore
expected that external stimulation to this region should affect task performance. However, it is
important to note that while subject performance on a task did often change after TMS, we did
not consistently observe an improvement (or degradation) in task performance across individ-
uals, nor was the effect consistent between tasks within a given subject. This suggests that
although the L-IFG plays an important role in the context of language comprehension, the
actual cognitive response reflects contributions from a larger part of the brain network.
Given the observed variability in the structural, dynamical, and behavioral aspects of our
data, we next focused on assessing how this variability was related across these three domains.
We therefore examined network features measured at both the global network level (using the
entire brain network) and within task-specfic subnetworks that were selected to represent the
specific circuitry involved in task completion and asked how these measures related to task
performance.
Global network features correlate with certain task performances
We first examined the relationship between global network properties and task performance
by estimating the correlation between global brain activation and task performance. For each
subject, we measured the threshold value of the global coupling parameter (cT
5) at which the
individual’s brain transitions to the excited state, and we calculated the correlation between
this value and their performance on each task (before the application of TMS). As seen in Fig 3
and Table 1, we observed a significant positive correlation (r = 0.86, 90% CI [0.68 0.95],

(NR). The red lines represent a linear fit to the data for visual guidance. The corresponding Pearson correlation
coefficients are given in Table 1. There is a significant correlation between the global transition value and task
performance for the SC task (r = 0.86, 90% CI [0.68 0.95], p = 0.001) that is preserved across the different scales of
brain parcellation (S1 Fig and S1 Table).

 p = 0.001) between model transition values and task performance in the sentence completion
(SC) task. Thus for the SC task, individuals with a lower value of cT
5 (more easily excitable
brain) are likely to perform better (as measured through a short response time). However, we
did not observe a significant correlation in the verb generation (VG) or number reading (NR)
tasks, indicating that the performance of these tasks cannot be predicted by a global network
property. To ensure that these results were dependent upon the organization of the subject-
specific anatomical connectivity used as a basis for the computational model, for each individ-
ual, we created randomized brain networks by preserving the distribution of edge weights but
randomly reassigning connection strengths between brain regions (Materials and methods).
We recalculated the cT
5 values for simulations using these randomized connectivity matrices,
but did not observe any significant correlations between transition values and task perfor-
mance in this case.
To further explore the link between global brain dynamics and behavior, we additionally
assessed the relationship between specific patterns of brain activity and task performance.
Since the L-IFG is involved in controlled language processing [54–56], one can argue that the
pattern of brain synchronization as a result of targeted stimulation to the region might also be
predictive of task performance. We therefore computationally stimulated the brain regions
comprising the L-IFG (Fig 4a), and quantified how the stimulation spread throughout the
global brain network (see Materials and methods for details). As shown in Fig 4a, computa-
tional stimulation pushes the dynamics of the region into oscillatory activity which then drives
the functional dynamics of other brain regions through the underlying structural connections.
We measure the resulting pattern of brain activity by calculating the pairwise functional con-
nectivity using the maximum normalized correlation between brain regions [45, 57, 58] (Mate-
rials and methods). In Fig 4b, we show the spatial mapping of the variability in average
functional connectivity across subjects (measured as the standard deviation divided by the
mean) resulting from computational stimulation of the L-IFG, and in Fig 4c, we show the sub-
ject-specific patterns of functional connectivity for three subjects. Due to the variability in the
underlying anatomical connectivity matrices, the resulting patterns of functional connectivity
differ between individuals. We measure the extent of the global spread of synchronization by
calculating the functional effect [45] which measures the average value of synchronization
across the entire brain (Materials and methods). Interestingly, unlike our observation with the

 global coupling parameter, the global functional effect does not show a significant correlation
with task performance for any of the cognitive tasks (Table 1).
Localized task-specific circuit features correlate with other task
performance
While we did observe a significant correlation between the global threshold value and task per-
formance for the SC task, we saw no correlations between global brain dynamics and task per-
formance in the remaining two tasks, and the global functional effect was not correlated with
performance in any of the tasks. However, the three language tasks performed in this study dif-
fer in semantic demands, and the absence of a significant correlation for the VG and NR tasks
could be due to either a drastically different cognitive mechanism for performing these tasks,
or the dependence of these tasks on a more localized brain circuit. To investigate the latter pos-
sibility, we assessed the role of task-specific subnetworks in task performance.
To construct a task dependent, spatially localized measure, we follow the work of Roux
et al. [59] to identify the possible brain regions involved in reading alphabets and numbers.
Roux et al. used intracranial direct cortical stimulation paired with behavioral measurements
to spatially map the brain regions that were differentially involved in reading both alphabets
and numbers. This approach provides a much more direct and causal form of evidence that
implicates the role of specific brain regions in the behaviors of interest as compared to anatom-
ical or functional networks based on task-related activity measured using fMRI, which are

(oscillations). (b) Spatial mapping of the variability in functional connectivity across subjects after computational

 indirect measures of cognitive circuits. We mapped these regions to the Lausanne atlas and
constructed two task circuits: one involved in VG and SC (alphabets-related, Fig 5a), and one
involved in NR (number-related, Fig 5b). We found that these circuits are also consistent with
other studies mapping brain regions involved in language processing [53, 60–62]. Note that
both of these sub-networks are contained entirely in the left hemispheric language network.
We then calculated the functional effect within these task circuits (averaging the functional
connectivity values only within the subnetwork as opposed to the entire brain network as done
previously) and correlated this local measure with task performances (Fig 5c–5e and Table 1).
We observed a significant positive correlation between the task-specific functional effect and
task performance for the NR task (r = 0.74, 90% CI [0.20 0.94], p = 0.016), indicating that per-
formance on the NR task depends on the localized spread of activation throughout the task
sub-network and is less dependent on the global brain network structure. Our results indicate
that individuals with a lower functional effect (less synchronization within the task circuit)
also have a lower response time (better performance). When synchronization within the task
circuit is increased (a high functional effect), task performance degrades, suggesting that high
levels of synchronized activity within the task circuit could potentially impede the ability of the
circuit to perform localized computations necessary for task completion.

 If we compare the functional effect measured only within brain regions outside of the task
circuit, the significant correlation with the NR task is lost (Table 1), indicating the specificity
of the task circuit in the model. Although we also observed a significant correlation between
the task-specific functional effect and task performance for the SC task, this result is driven by
a single subject and does not hold if this subject is removed from the data set. Performing the
analysis on a larger data set would therefore be necessary to confirm this finding for the SC
task. No significant correlations were observed for the VG task.
To validate the specificity of our selected task circuits, we constructed 10,000 random sub-
networks by randomly selecting the same number of brain regions as in each task circuit and
then calculated the functional effect within these random circuits after stimulating the L-IFG
(Materials and methods). The randomized circuits had a variable degree of overlap with the
actual task circuit (0 to 35%). We observed that only 1.8% of the randomly selected circuits
gave significant correlations (r > 0.5 and p < 0.05) between the circuit-specific functional
effect and task performance, which we estimate to be the false positive rate in our computa-
tional predictions. This low error rate signifies that the observed significant correlation in the
NR task is due to the selection of brain regions in the task-specific circuit.
We also verified that the observed effects were related to our choice of stimulating the
L-IFG as opposed to some other brain structure. We chose different sets of brain regions
(equal in size to the number of brain regions that compose the L-IFG) that were randomly dis-
tributed within the task circuit and applied targeted computational stimulation to these ran-
domly selected regions. When randomly selected brain regions were stimulated, we did not
observe a significant correlation between the task performance and functional effect, confirm-
ing the importance of specifically targeting the L-IFG in our in silico experiments. Addition-
ally, consistent with previous findings [45], we observed that the patterning of activation as a
result of stimulation of randomly selected brain regions varied with the selection of brain
regions and across subjects. These findings support the possibility that in the future our model-
ing approach can be used to help design and optimize therapeutic strategies that use external
activation such as TMS to treat neurological disorders [63].
Correlating task performance post-TMS
We also asked if our computational model correlated with individual performance after the
application of experimentally applied TMS targeted at the L-IFG. The underlying mechanisms
of how TMS affects the brain are not well understood, but it is believed that TMS locally influ-
ences neuronal firing which can then propagate within the brain through inter-regional neuro-
anatomical pathways [45, 64]. We therefore examined the correlation between model features
and behavioral performance during the post-TMS task. As seen in Fig 6 and Table 2, while we
still observe a positive correlation between the transition value and performance in the SC task
(r = 0.68, 90% CI [0.32 0.87], p = 0.03) and between the functional effect within the task circuit
and performance in the NR task (r = 0.63, 90% CI [-0.07 0.88], p = 0.05), in both cases, the
strength of the correlation is decreased when compared to correlations with task performance
before TMS. It should also be noted that these correlations exist across the two spatial scales of
parcellation but their significance does not survive multiple comparison corrections. Specula-
tively, the fact that the correlation strength is weakened post-TMS potentially reflects contribu-
tions of noise to the system mediated through inhibitory stimulation to the L-IFG.
Correlations with graph theoretical measures of network connectivity
Finally, to be able to draw a direct connection between anatomical brain connectivity and
behavior, we asked if the correlations observed in our computational model of brain dynamics

 could be revealed using only graph theoretical measures of network structure applied directly
to the anatomical connectivity matrices alone (in the absence of model dynamics). We there-
fore calculated three measures of network structure that have been shown to be related to the
spread of synchronization in networks: the average degree, inverse spectral radius, and syn-
chronizability (see Materials and methods). The average degree measures the average strength
of connections per brain region, while the spectral radius and synchronizability are related to
the eigenspectrum of the adjacency matrix or graph Laplacian respectively, and relate to the
ease and extent to which the network is expected to synchronize under the assumption that
regions behaved as oscillators.
In Table 3, we report the Pearson correlation coefficients for these measures of network
structure with task performance both before and after TMS was applied. Both the average
degree and the inverse spectral radius show significant correlations with task performance for
the SC task, and as observed earlier, show a decrease in their correlation magnitude after the
application of TMS. Both of these measures are known to relate to the ease of global synchroni-
zation in a network [65, 66], and therefore this finding is somewhat expected given our prior
observations about cT
5. Interestingly, we find that the synchronizability of the network does not
correlate with performance of the SC task. Instead, this measure, which has also been shown to
be more sensitive to changes in local network structure [67, 68], shows a correlation with per-
formance of the NR task that increases after the application of TMS. However, this correlation
is weaker than that observed with the local measurements of the functional effect within the
task circuit reported earlier in Table 1.
Discussion
We presented a computational model of individualized brain dynamics that allows us to make
predictions about cognitive task performance based on the variability of anatomical brain con-
nectivity between people. By analyzing global model excitability and localized patterns in the
spread of a targeted stimulation in our data-driven model, we explain individual variability in

 the performance of cognitively demanding tasks and establish the significant role of brain net-
work organization in driving individual behavior.
We examined three cognitive tasks and found that different measures of model dynamics
gave rise to correlations with task performance. Our results indicate that as the complexity of
the cognitive task increases, a larger portion of the brain network, including interhemispheric
connections, contribute in determining the overall response. The SC task, which has additional
language processing demands compared to the other two tasks, requires understanding differ-
ent words, constructing the overall meaning of the sentence, and determining the appropriate
word to fit in the sentence. For this cognitively demanding task, a global parameter of the
model, cT
5, which could be related to the overall excitability of the network, correlates with indi-
vidual task performance. We also observed significant correlations between global network
properties of the anatomical connectivity matrices (specifically the average degree and inverse
spectral radius) and performance of the SC task. The fact that these global measures are corre-
lated with performance in the SC task but not the other two tasks possibly reflects the global
nature and complexity of the network of brain regions required to complete a sentence [69].
On the other hand, performances on the NR task, which has been established to be more
localized in terms of the brain regions involved (i.e., involves the activation of only a sub-net-
work of the brain as opposed to the entire brain network) [59], can be predicted by tracking
the spread of a targeted stimulation within a task-specific circuit in the brain. Further, we
observed that a higher functional effect of the stimulation correlates with a higher response
time (poorer performance) on the NR task. In our model, a high functional effect indicates a
high degree of synchronization within the task circuit. This heightened level of synchroniza-
tion could effectively constrain the degrees of freedom for brain circuit activity and computa-
tion, resulting in poorer task performance. Better task performance might be achieved through
an integration and segregation mechanism which allows brain regions to mutually communi-
cate but does not require synchrony over a longer time scale. Such a modular functional orga-
nization has been associated with efficient learning of motor skills [5].
Interestingly, no tested measures of model dynamics or structural network features were
able to explain the performance of the VG task. It is likely that VG requires a different coupling
mechanism of global and local dynamics which is not captured in the model features con-
structed here. For example, while verb generation and sentence completion are both “open
ended” language tasks, SC requires our ability to accumulate the probability of a response over
an entire sentence, whereas VG is cued by a single word. Thus, even if both involve the L-IFG,
SC might recruit quite a few more distributed resources, while VG might require more focal
resources. It is possible that our selection of regions comprising the language task circuit was
not sensitive enough to these focal areas. We propose that this problem could potentially be
resolved by a more extensive research effort that combines experimental and theoretical
approaches from cognitive and network neuroscience in order to better understand the spe-
cific circuitry involved in task completion.
A somewhat surprising finding was that the application of TMS did not have a directional
effect; task performance both improved and degraded post-TMS. One might ask if this could
be interpreted as a regression to the mean. However, here, our primary focus for behavioral
analyses was on the correlation between inter-subject differences in response times and the
simulated dynamic measures. We found evidence that our measures of simulated network
excitability independently correlated with behavior before and after stimulation. That is, the
relationship between behavior and our excitability measures cannot be explained by regression
to the mean because they do not involve a correlation with changes in behavior over time,
which would indeed be potentially susceptible to regression to the mean. However, it is true

 that predicting variability in change scores where a brain stimulation effect is strong across
subjects is an important future direction.
A strength of our modeling approach is that the construction of localized task circuits is not
limited to those involved in the tasks studied here, and could easily be extended to represent dif-
ferent brain circuitry. Ultimately, our model magnifies the effects of differences in the observed
anatomical brain structure, and it is not always feasible to measure differences in network
structure in terms of general network statistics. While some network statistics also provided
predictive power of task performance, the strength of the correlation was only comparable for
measures of global network structure, and our computational model can generate measures of
structure and dynamics specific to the task that is being performed. We also note that while in
the SC task we saw correlations between global measures of network structure such as the aver-
age degree and inverse spectral radius, we did not observe consistently significant correlations
between measures of network structure and the NR task; correlations between synchronizability
and NR task performance existed only at the 234-region scale and did not survive multiple com-
parison corrections. This suggests that for tasks that invoke local computations involving spe-
cific circuitry, generic measures of network structure might not be sensitive to anatomical
variations in the local circuitry. However, within the modeling framework presented here, we
are able to define task-specific subnetworks and examine the patterns of brain activity within
these local circuits, making the use of computational modeling preferable to assess potential
relationships between variability in individual brain structure and task performance.
It should also be noted that the functional measures examined here (for both global and
task circuit specific calculations) involved measuring the spread of synchronization after
computational stimulation of the L-IFG. The choice to stimulate the L-IFG represents essential
a priori knowledge from cognitive neuroscience studies, and stimulating randomly chosen sets
of brain regions within the task circuits did not produce significant correlations with task per-
formances. In other paradigms, one might prefer to study the effects of stimulation to a differ-
ent brain region, or to compare the effects of applying stimulation to multiple different brain
regions. In each scenario, the exact design of the appropriate computational experiment will
depend on the cognitive question at hand and the type of experimental data with which one
wishes to compare model outputs. The ability to integrate knowledge from cognitive neurosci-
ence into computational experiments represents a strength of our data-driven modeling
approach, as it makes the model flexible and opens the door to studies across a range of cogni-
tive paradigms. As stimulation strategies are increasingly being used to treat neurological dis-
orders, we hope that our modeling framework can guide the design, personalization, and
understanding of such treatment strategies.
Although the current study was constrained by its small subject population size, it is
encouraging that despite this limitation, we were still able to observe significant correlations
between model features and certain task performance. These findings should therefore serve
as a proof of principle study to promote the use of similar data-driven modeling approaches in
larger data sets with more subjects and a higher diversity of task conditions. The use of person-
alized brain network models will serve as an increasingly valuable tool to establish explicit
links between brain connectivity, dynamics, and behavior, and to develop personalized thera-
peutic strategies.

Subjects and cognitive tasks
Ten healthy individuals (mean age = 25.4, St.D. = 4.5, 6 female) from a larger neuroimaging
study [70] returned to participate in the present study. Participants performed two open-
ended language tasks and one closed-ended number naming task. The language tasks
included a verb generation task [50] and a sentence completion task [51]. For the verb gener-
ation task, subjects were instructed to generate the first verb that came to mind when pre-
sented with a noun stimulus (e.g., ‘cat’). The verb could be either something that the noun
does or something that can be done with the noun. Response times (RTs) were collected
from the onset of the noun cue to the onset of the verb response. For the sentence comple-
tion task, subjects were presented with a sentence, for example “They left the dirty dishes in
the —–?”, and were instructed to generate a single word that appropriately completes the
sentence, such as ‘sink’. Words in the sentences were presented serially in 1 s segments con-
sisting of one or two words. RTs were computed as the latency between the onset of the last
segment, which always contained two words (i.e., a word and an underline), and the onset of
the participant’s response. For all items in the sentence completion task, items in the high vs.
low selection demand conditions were matched on retrieval demands (association strength)
[51]. For both language tasks, each trial began with the presentation of a fixation point (+)
for 500 ms, followed by the presentation of the target stimulus, which remained on the
screen for 10 s until the subject made a response. Subjects were given an example and five
practice trials in the first administration of each language task (i.e., before TMS), and were
reminded of the instructions before performing the task a second time (i.e., after TMS). In
each of the before and after TMS conditions, subjects completed 50 trials for a total of 100
trials.
In the number reading task, participants produced the English names for strings of Arabic
numerals presented on the screen. On each trial, a randomized number (from tens of thou-
sands to millions; e.g., 56395, 614592, 7246856) was presented in black text on a white back-
ground. The numbers were uniformly distributed over three lengths (17 per length for each
task administration). The position of items on the screen was randomized between the center,
left, and right of the screen to reduce the availability of visual cues to number length and syntax
[50]. RTs were collected from the onset of the stimulus presentations to the onset of the sub-
ject’s response. The number appeared in gray following the detection of a response (i.e., voice
key trigger), and remained on the screen thereafter to reduce the working memory demands
required for remembering the digit string. At the start of the experiment, subjects performed
50 trials of the number naming task to account for initial learning effects [50]. Prior to per-
forming the task for the first time, subjects were given an example and five practice trials, and
were later reminded of the instructions before performing the task a second (i.e., before TMS)
and a third (i.e., after TMS) time. In each of the before and after TMS conditions, subjects
completed 51 trials for a total of 102 experimental trials. The items for the verb generation task
were identical to those used in [71] and the items for the sentence completion task were those
from [72]. The difficulty of items was sampled to cover a distribution of values computed via
latent semantic analysis (LSA) applied to corpus data.
Verbal responses for all tasks were collected from a computer headset microphone. The
microphone was calibrated to reduce sensitivity to environment background noise prior to the
collection of data for each session such that the recording software was not triggered without
clear verbalizations. List order (before or after TMS) was counterbalanced across participants.

 Item presentation order within each task was fully randomized across participants. Task per-
formance was assessed based on the subject’s median response time across all the trials.
Experimental design
A schematic of the experimental design can be seen in Fig 7. Subjects performed the verb gen-
eration, sentence completion, and number reading tasks in a randomized order across sub-
jects. Then, the subjects received 40s of continuous theta burst stimulation. Finally, the
subjects performed alternate difficulty-matched forms of each task (i.e., matched distributions
of association strengths and entropy values across items for the sentence completion and verb
generation task, and matched distributions of number lengths in the number reading task)
after stimulation in the same order as before stimulation.
Transcranial magnetic stimulation
The Brainsight system (Rogue Research, Montreal) was used to co-register MRI data with the
location of the subject and the TMS coil. The stimulation site was defined as the posterior
extent of the pars triangularis in each individual subject’s registered T1 image. A Magstim
Super Rapid2 Plus1 stimulator (Magstim; Whitland, UK) was used to deliver continuous theta
burst stimulation (cTBS) via a 70 mm diameter figure-eight coil. cTBS was delivered at 80% of
each participant’s active motor threshold [73]. Each participant’s threshold was determined
prior to the start of the experimental session using a standard up-down staircase procedure
with stimulation to the motor cortex [M1]. The measured thresholds (given in units measured
as the percentage of machine output from the Magstim device) for the 10 participants were 68,
60, 46, 57, 37, 36, 44, 39, 46, and 65, respectively.
Human DSI data acquisition and preprocessing
Diffusion spectrum images (DSI) were acquired for a total of 10 subjects along with a
T1-weighted anatomical scan at each scanning session, in line with previous work [64]. DSI
scans sampled 257 directions using a Q5 half-shell acquisition scheme with a maximum b-
value of 5,000 and an isotropic voxel size of 2.4 mm. We utilized an axial acquisition with the
following parameters: repetition time (TR) = 5 s, echo time (TE) = 138 ms, 52 slices, field of
view (FoV) (231, 231, 125 mm). DSI data were reconstructed in DTI Studio (www.dsi-studio.
labsolver.org) using q-space diffeomorphic reconstruction (QSDR) [74]. QSDR first recon-
structs diffusion-weighted images in native space and computes the quantitative anisotropy
(QA) in each voxel. These QA values are used to warp the brain to a template QA volume in
Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space using the statistical parametric mapping (SPM)
nonlinear registration algorithm. Once in MNI space, spin density functions were again recon-
structed with a mean diffusion distance of 1.25 mm using three fiber orientations per voxel.
Fiber tracking was performed in DSI Studio with an angular cutoff of 35˚, step size of 1.0 mm,
minimum length of 10 mm, spin density function smoothing of 0.0, maximum length of 400
mm and a QA threshold determined by DWI signal in the colony-stimulating factor.

 Deterministic fiber tracking using a modified FACT algorithm was performed until 1,000,000
streamlines were reconstructed for each individual.
Anatomical (T1) scans were segmented using FreeSurfer [75] and parcellated using the con-
nectome mapping toolkit [76]. We studied two different scales of regional parcellation (n = 83
or n = 234 brain regions) which were registered to the B0 volume from each subject’s DSI data.
The B0 to MNI voxel mapping produced via QSDR was used to map region labels from native
space to MNI coordinates. To extend region labels through the grey-white matter interface,
the atlas was dilated by 4 mm [77]. Dilation was accomplished by filling non-labelled voxels
with the statistical mode of their neighbors’ labels. In the event of a tie, one of the modes was
arbitrarily selected. Each streamline was labeled according to its terminal region pair.
Construction of anatomical brain networks
To construct the subject-specific anatomical connectivity networks each brain region was rep-
resented as a network node. A list of brain regions included in our study is given in S4 Table
for both the 83-region and 234-region parcellations. As in prior studies, we define pairwise
connection weights between nodes based on the number of streamlines connecting brain
regions and normalized by the sum of the volumes of the nodes [45, 52]. This procedure results
in a sparse, weighted, undirected structural brain network for each subject (N = 10), where net-
work connections represent the density of white matter tracts between brain regions (Fig 1b).
Computational model of brain dynamics
In our data-driven network model, regional brain dynamics are given by Wilson-Cowan oscil-
lators [45, 47]. In this biologically motivated model of neuronal populations, the fraction of
excitatory and inhibitory neurons active at time t in the ith brain region are denoted by Ei(t)
and Ii(t) respectively, and their temporal dynamics are given by:

We note that Aij is an element of the subject-specific coupling matrix, A, whose value is the
connection strength between brain regions i and j as determined from DSI data (see above).
The global strength of coupling between brain regions is tuned by excitatory and inhibitory
coupling parameters c5 and c6 respectively. We fix c6 = c5/4, representing the approximate ratio
of excitatory to inhibitory coupling. Pi(t) represents the external inputs to excitatory state
activity and is used to perform computational stimulation experiments (see below). The
parameter t

d represents the communication delay between regions i and j. If the spatial

 distance between regions i and j is dij, t
ij
d ¼ dij=td, where td = 10m/s is the signal transmission
velocity. Additive noise is input to the system through the parameters wi(t) and vi(t) which are
derived from a normal distribution and σ = 10−5. Other constants in the model are biologically
derived: c1 = 16, c2 = 12, c3 = 15, c4 = 3, aE = 1.3, aI = 2, θE = 4, θI = 3.7, τ = 8 as described in ref-
erences [45, 47].
To numerically simulate the dynamics of the system we use a second order Runge Kutta
method with step size 0.1 and initial conditions Ei(0) = Ii(0) = 0.1. All analysis is performed
after allowing the system to stabilize for 1s.
Assessing individual variability
In order to calculate the model transition values for each individual, we ran 1s simulations
(after allowing the system to stabilize) for a range of c5 parameters (0.05 � c5 � 0.25, with a
step-size of 0.001) in which no external input was applied (P = 0). The average excitatory activ-
ity was recorded for each region as a function of c5 as shown in Fig 1c. The value of c5 at which
we observed a sudden increase in the average activity (marked by an arrow in Fig 1c), was
identified as the transition value, cT
5.
Structural variability was measured by calculating the standard deviation of a given connec-
tion strength Aij between brain regions i and j for all the subjects and then normalizing by the
average connection strength, <Aij>. In Fig 2d we show the regional average value of the struc-
tural variability across individuals. Similarly, the average functional variability, as also shown
in Fig 2d, was estimated for brain regions by calculating the standard deviation of the excit-
atory activity of a given brain region Ei across individuals and then normalizing by the average
excitatory activity of that region across individuals.
In Fig 4b, the variability in regional functional connectivity is calculated as the standard
deviation of the average regional functional connectivity across individuals divided by the
regional mean of functional connectivity across individuals.
Targeted computational activation
To activate (stimulate) a particular brain region, we applied a constant external input Pi = 1.15
which drives the regional activity into a limit cycle as shown in Fig 4b. Before targeted activa-
tion, the global coupling parameter c5 was fixed just below its transition value cT
5 (which differs
between subjects) to perturb the system in a state with maximum sensitivity for perturbations.
When stimulating the L-IFG, we simultaneously activated four brain regions (pars orbitalis
(POB), pars triangularis (PTA) and pars opercularis (POC, two regions), Fig 4a) by applying an
external input of P = 1.15.
Functional connectivity and functional effect of stimulation
To quantify the spread of computational stimulation, functional connectivity was determined
by calculating the pairwise maximum normalized cross-correlation [57, 58] between the excit-
atory activity Ei(t) and Ej(t), for brain regions i and j. We used a window size of 1s and calcu-
lated correlations over a maximum lag of 250ms.
In order to quantify the functional effect of stimulation, we considered the regional dynam-
ics within a window of 2s once the system is stabilized after the initial transient period. The
system was first allowed to evolve without any external input (Pi = 0) for 1s and then an exter-
nal input of Pi = 1.15 was applied for 1s to the set of brain regions selected for activation or
stimulation. Functional connectivity was calculated separately for the stimulation-free period
and the period of stimulation. We then calculated the difference between the pairwise values of

 functional connectivity measured during and before stimulation, resulting in a matrix that
describes the pairwise changes in functional connectivity resulting from the stimulation. The
functional effect of stimulation [45] was then calculated using this matrix either globally by
averaging over the entire matrix, or within a task circuit by averaging within the task circuit,
or outside of a task circuit by averaging over regions outside of the task circuit.
Defining task circuits
To construct a task dependent localized measure, we followed the work of Roux et al. [59] to
identify the possible brain regions involved in reading alphabets and numbers. We extended
their findings to propose that the brain regions involved in reading alphabets contribute
towards performing VG and SC tasks, and the brain regions involved in reading numbers con-
tribute towards performing the NR task. We mapped these regions to the Lausanne atlas and
constructed possible task circuits involved in VG and SC (alphabets-related, Fig 5a), and NR
(number-related, Fig 5b). These circuits are also consistent with other studies mapping brain
regions involved in language processing [53, 60–62].
Randomizing network structure and stimulation effect
To assess the effect of global network organization, we repeated our entire computational anal-
ysis with randomized anatomical connectivity matrices. Anatomical connectivity matrices
were randomized separately for each individual in order to alter the original brain network
organization. Here, we preserved the overall connectivity distribution but randomly reas-
signed connection strength values to each pair of the brain regions from this distribution.
To test the specificity of our results to the choice of regions comprising the task circuit, we
constructed 10, 000 sub-networks by randomly picking the same number of brain regions as
in the NR circuit (22) from all of the 234 brain regions. We then stimulated the L-IFG and cal-
culated the functional effect within these randomly constructed sub-networks for each individ-
ual. These sub-networks had varying degree of overlap with the actual task circuit, ranging
from 0 to 35%. We observed that only 1.8% of the random sub-networks produced a signifi-
cant correlation between the localized functional effect and task performance with r > 0.5 and
p < 0.05, indicating that our results are indeed related to the specific construction of the task
circuit.
In order to assess the importance of stimulating the L-IFG for the cognitive tasks chosen in
this particular work, we compared our findings with those when stimulation was applied to a
group of regions randomly chosen (under spatial constraints) within the actual task circuits
with a regional brain volume equivalent to L-IFG (4 brain regions). The 4 brain regions were
chosen such that they formed a continuous spatial volume within the brain. We could identify
7 such volumes within the task circuits that we constructed, and used these 7 alternate stimula-
tion sites to assess the specificity of our findings to the choice of stimulation site. The model
did not produce significant correlations when any of these 7 volumes were stimulated, indicat-
ing that the model is indeed sensitive to the choice of stimulation site.
Confidence intervals and multiple comparison testing
In order to calculate 90% confidence intervals of the Pearson’s correlation coefficient, r, we
bootstrapped each sample 5000 times (with replacements). We used the resulting distribution
of r values to obtain the 0.05 and 0.95 quantiles.
We tested the significance of correlations under multiple comparison corrections by apply-
ing the false discovery rate (FDR) correction to p-values across tasks. Correlations were
deemed to be significant under multiple comparisons if the corrected p-value was less than

 0.05. In all tables throughout the text, we report original (uncorrected) p-values, and indicate
whether or not the findings remained significant as a result of applying the FDR correction.
Network statistics
We calculated network statistics for each subject using the structural matrices derived
from their DSI data. The weighted degree centrality, ki, for a given region i is defined as
ki ¼ P234
j¼1 Aij [78]. The average across the degree centralities of all network nodes was used to
obtain the average degree of a given subject. The spectral radius, Sr, is given by the maximum
eigenvalue of the connectivity matrix A, Sr = λ|Max, and is a global measure of network struc-
ture that is related to the spread of synchronization in a network [65, 66]. Synchronizability, S,
is defined as, S ¼
lL
2
lL
Max, where lL
2 and lL
Max denote the second smallest and the largest eigenvalue
of the Laplacian matrix L (L = D − A, where D is the degree matrix of A) [67, 68].
