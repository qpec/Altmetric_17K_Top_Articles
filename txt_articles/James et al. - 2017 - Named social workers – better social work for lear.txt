ABSTRACT
In 2016, the Department of Health in England announced that 
it would pilot the role of Named Social Worker. We chose to 
be part of the pilot because we regularly witness too many 
people’s lives being defined by restrictions imposed by 
professionals. Erroneous associations between the concepts 
of risk and danger have become the norm in how learning 
disabled people’s decision-making is perceived and managed. 
However, we believe social workers educated in the social 
model of disability and grounded more generally in disability 
studies offer an alternative perspective. The pilot is an 
opportunity to test our hypothesis that social work practice 
rooted in social model thinking can successfully challenge 
oppressive practice and disabling barriers, thus providing the 
opportunity for social workers to genuinely be ‘servants not 
masters’ in the lives of disabled people.
Introduction
In 2016, the Department of Health in England announced that it would be piloting 
the role of Named Social Worker to support learning disabled people, inviting 
applications from local authorities that wanted to test innovative ways of practice 
to enable people to lead as ‘fulfilling and independent lives as they can, and have 
the support to make choices that are right for them’
. The ambition for the pilot is 
to build on the ‘established values, knowledge, skills and ethics of social work – 
holistic, person-centred and proactive in co-opting awareness and support from 
other services’ to ensure support for people where their dignity is respected and 
their rights are upheld (Romeo 2016a). We (Calderdale Adult Social Care working 
with Lancaster University) applied, in partnership with the self-advocacy group 
Lead the Way, to contribute to the pilot because we believe that too many learning 
disabled people are living lives confined by restrictions placed on them by health

and social care professionals. Our application wanted to test our hypothesis that 
a reimagined social work role, as an applied social scientist (Croisdale-Appleby 
2014) steeped in the social model of disability and as an expert in equality, men-
tal capacity and human rights law, could act as a challenge to other professional 
voices within the health and social care system (Figure 1).
Learning disabled people experience prejudice and discrimination (Mansell 
2010) which manifests within the health and social care system as endemic low 
expectations and a lack of ambition for people’s futures. The impact of the unjust 
nature (Whitehead 1992) of the experience of the health and social care system 
by learning disabled people in England is observed in their over-representation in 
long-stay hospital beds and on registers of people living in the community who 
healthcare professionals perceive to be a risk to themselves and others (James, 
Hatton, and Brown forthcoming). In doing so, an erroneous association is being 
made on the part of health and social care professionals between ideas of risk 
and danger, resulting in paternalistic responses to disabled people, in particular 
people who exhibit behaviours which challenge professionals. The response of 
the majority of health and social care professionals of commissioning restrictive 
services to manage perceived levels of risk has been aptly described as wrapping 
people in ‘forensic cotton wool’ in a recent Court of Protection judgement (A NHS 
Trust v P & Anor 2013). This tendency of professionals to impose colourless, restric-
tive lives was observed by Justice Hedley in his judgement, which also shone a 
light on the assumptions made by professionals about the extent of their legal 
powers to mitigate perceived risk through imposing restrictions on the lives of 
learning disabled people:
A person is not to be treated as unable to make a decision merely because he makes 
an unwise decision … the intention of the Act is not to dress an incapacitous person 
in forensic cotton wool but to allow them as far as possible to make the same mistakes 
that all other human beings are at liberty to make and not infrequently do. (A NHS Trust 
v P & Anor 2013)
The impact of such imposed restriction on the lives of people and their families 
can be devastating, as seen in the abuse experienced by Steven Neary (London 
Borough of Hillingdon v Neary & Anor 2011); the routinised abuse exposed at 
Winterbourne View care home (Department of Health 2012); the death through

neglect of Connor Sparrowhawk whilst supposedly in the care of NHS Southern 
Health (2016); and the stories told by families during the 2016 7 Days of Action cam-
paigns (James, Neary, and Hatton 2016). There is still limited systematic evaluation 
of the impact (or more often not/or absence of) social work has on avoiding such 
tragic outcomes. However, the stories told by the families who have experienced 
the health care system at its most restrictive and controlling are generating an 
emerging evidence base marked by consistent themes:
•  
people and families are not being listened to and their views are not taken 
into account when decisions are taken by professionals about them;
•  
the most restrictive option being taken by professionals – usually the 
removal of the person from their family and admitting them to a hospital or 
care home – in response to a presenting crisis when people and their fami-
lies are asking for help;
•  
the purpose and effectiveness of assessment, care and treatment (the spec-
ified purpose of forensic settings; RCP 2013) once the person was removed 
from their family ranging from ineffectively unclear to compromising of their 
dignity, rights and, in the case of Connor Sparrowhawk, his right to life; and
•  
insufficient attention given to working with the person and their family 
members to plan an end to the treatment and for a sustainable return home 
(James, Neary, and Hatton 2016).
Writing from a user perspective grounded in disability studies, Beresford and 
Boxall (2012) argue that for social work to be heard and make a better contribu-
tion to ensuring people experience their full range of rights as citizens, it needs to 
strengthen its intellectual nature and evidence base. We agree with this argument 
and welcome Croisdale-Appleby’s (2014, 14) revisioning of social workers as social 
scientists and Chief Social Worker for Adults in England Lyn Romeo’s commitment 
description of social work as ‘all about human rights’ (Romeo 2016b). The culture 
of social work, at the deepest level of values in action, is critical to changing how 
people experience their lives. If social workers are to genuinely make a positive 
difference, standing alongside the person, they need to really believe that their role 
is one of a servant, not a master (Munby 2011). Good social work is professional 
practice which is both grounded in the social model of disability (Morgan 2012) 
and in mental capacity and human rights legal literacy expertise.
From the early 1980s, when proposals to move to a more holistic approach 
towards providing community care for learning disabled people were articulated 
(Stevens 2004), UK policy-makers have proposed a role for social workers in meet-
ing the wider needs and aspirations of learning disabled people as citizens by 
acting as a source of advice and connecting people to wider circles of support. 
However laudable as a direction for social work this ambition may be, it will fail to 
meet learning disabled people’s hopes, wishes and needs if social workers do not 
first have a strong understanding of the social model of disability, independent

living and the forces of institutionalised disablism which they will need to over-
come. It is over 30 years since Oliver developed the social model of disability; 
however, social work still has a chequered relationship with the model and the

challenge it brings of truly giving up professional power and devolving it back to 
people (Morgan and Roulstone 2012) (Figure 2).
The vision for adult social work (Department of Health 2016) is the most recent 
attempt to define the role of Named Social Worker as an advocate within the 
professions for the social model of disability. In keeping with wider policy goals 
to transform care and support (Department of Health 2012), the initial pilot of the 
role of Named Social Worker has focused on the impact the role could and should 
have on the lives of learning disabled people. Whilst we remain concerned that the 
pilot may inadvertently result in reinforcing a view of professional dominance, the 
‘expert’ Named Social Worker with capitals in their title, we remain hopeful that our 
involvement may provide evidence that there is another way. Our involvement in 
the pilot is demonstrating that social workers can make a difference in challenging 
the dominance of professional functionalist, reductionist perspectives of learning 
disabled people as being a risk and danger to themselves and others who require 
protection through restrictions (Figure 3).
Conclusion
Whilst it is too early to draw firm conclusions from the pilot, we are learning that a 
reimagined social work role could be a positive development. Most social workers 
hold values which drive them towards a belief that their intervention will help the 
person they are there to support. However, the endemic low ambition and expec-
tations with which too many professionals devalue the lives of learning disabled 
people mean this approach is insufficient. Social workers educated in the social 
model of disability, with its theoretical underpinnings in disability studies, holds 
promise to support a rights-based approach which could challenge deep held 
values and assumptions. We are hopeful that over time this approach may result 
in learning disabled people experiencing better social work which enables them 
to access their full range of their rights as citizens.
