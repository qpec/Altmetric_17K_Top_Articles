BACKGROUND
Nivolumab combined with ipilimumab resulted in longer progression-free survival 
and a higher objective response rate than ipilimumab alone in a phase 3 trial involv-
ing patients with advanced melanoma. We now report 3-year overall survival outcomes 
in this trial.
METHODS
We randomly assigned, in a 1:1:1 ratio, patients with previously untreated advanced 
melanoma to receive nivolumab at a dose of 1 mg per kilogram of body weight plus 
ipilimumab at a dose of 3 mg per kilogram every 3 weeks for four doses, followed 
by nivolumab at a dose of 3 mg per kilogram every 2 weeks; nivolumab at a dose 
of 3 mg per kilogram every 2 weeks plus placebo; or ipilimumab at a dose of 3 mg 
per kilogram every 3 weeks for four doses plus placebo, until progression, the oc-
currence of unacceptable toxic effects, or withdrawal of consent. Randomization 
was stratified according to programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) status, BRAF mu-
tation status, and metastasis stage. The two primary end points were progression-
free survival and overall survival in the nivolumab-plus-ipilimumab group and in the 
nivolumab group versus the ipilimumab group.
RESULTS
At a minimum follow-up of 36 months, the median overall survival had not been 
reached in the nivolumab-plus-ipilimumab group and was 37.6 months in the 
nivolumab group, as compared with 19.9 months in the ipilimumab group (hazard 
ratio for death with nivolumab plus ipilimumab vs. ipilimumab, 0.55 [P<0.001]; 
hazard ratio for death with nivolumab vs. ipilimumab, 0.65 [P<0.001]). The overall 
survival rate at 3 years was 58% in the nivolumab-plus-ipilimumab group and 52% 
in the nivolumab group, as compared with 34% in the ipilimumab group. The safety 
profile was unchanged from the initial report. Treatment-related adverse events of 
grade 3 or 4 occurred in 59% of the patients in the nivolumab-plus-ipilimumab group, 
in 21% of those in the nivolumab group, and in 28% of those in the ipilimumab group.
CONCLUSIONS
Among patients with advanced melanoma, significantly longer overall survival oc-
curred with combination therapy with nivolumab plus ipilimumab or with nivolu-
mab alone than with ipilimumab alone. (Funded by Bristol-Myers Squibb and others;

T
he treatment of advanced melano-
ma has improved considerably over the past 
6 years. Ipilimumab, an anti–cytotoxic 
 
T-lymphocyte–associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) fully 
human monoclonal antibody, was the first sys-
temic therapy to show prolonged overall survival 
among patients with advanced melanoma in ran-
domized, controlled, phase 3 trials.1,2 A pooled 
analysis of data from 12 studies of ipilimumab 
in advanced melanoma showed a 3-year rate of 
overall survival of 26% among previously untreated 
patients and survival up to 10 years among ap-
proximately 20% of all patients.3 The anti–pro-
grammed death 1 (PD-1) agents nivolumab and 
pembrolizumab have shown superior overall sur-
vival, progression-free survival, and objective re-
sponse rate, with a better safety profile, than ipi-
limumab alone.4-6 In the phase 3 KEYNOTE-006 
trial involving patients with advanced melanoma, 
the overall survival rate at 33 months was 50% 
in the pembrolizumab group, as compared with 
39% in the ipilimumab group.6
Combination therapy with nivolumab plus ipi-
limumab has shown consistent efficacy in patients 
with advanced melanoma. At a follow-up of more 
than 33 months in a phase 1 dose-finding study, 
nivolumab plus ipilimumab resulted in an overall 
survival rate at 3 years of 68% among patients 
with advanced melanoma, regardless of whether 
they had received treatment previously.7 Results 
from the randomized phase 2 CheckMate 069 trial 
involving previously untreated patients8 showed 
a rate of overall survival at 2 years of 64% in the 
group that received combination therapy and 
54% in the group that received ipilimumab 
alone.9 Previously reported data from the phase 
3 CheckMate 067 trial involving patients with 
previously untreated advanced melanoma showed 
significantly longer progression-free survival and 
higher rates of objective response with nivolumab 
plus ipilimumab and with nivolumab alone than 
with ipilimumab alone.4,10 In this article, we pro-
vide the first analysis of 3-year overall survival 
data from the CheckMate 067 trial.
Methods
Patients
Adult patients with previously untreated, histologi-
cally confirmed stage III (unresectable) or stage IV 
melanoma, with known BRAF V600 mutation sta-
tus, and with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology 
Group performance-status score of 0 or 1 (on a 
5-point scale, with higher scores indicating great-
er disability) were included in the trial. The full list 
of eligibility criteria has been reported previously.4
Trial Design and Treatment
In this double-blind, phase 3 trial, patients were 
randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive one 
of the following regimens: nivolumab at a dose 
of 1 mg per kilogram of body weight every 3 weeks 
plus ipilimumab at a dose of 3 mg per kilogram 
every 3 weeks for four doses, followed by nivolum-
ab at a dose of 3 mg per kilogram every 2 weeks; 
nivolumab at a dose of 3 mg per kilogram every 
2 weeks (plus ipilimumab-matched placebo); or 
ipilimumab at a dose of 3 mg per kilogram every 
3 weeks for four doses (plus nivolumab-matched 
placebo).4 Randomization was stratified accord-
ing to BRAF mutation status, metastasis stage, and 
programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) status. 
Treatment was continued until disease progres-
sion, the development of unacceptable toxic events, 
or withdrawal of consent. Patients with clinical 
benefit and without substantial adverse events 
could be treated beyond progression according 
to the investigator’s decision.
The two primary end points were progression-
free survival and overall survival, as compared 
between the nivolumab-plus-ipilimumab group or 
the nivolumab monotherapy group and the ipi 
lim-
umab monotherapy group. Secondary end points 
were the assessment of the objective response rate; 
descriptive evaluations of overall survival, pro-
gression-free survival, and the objective response 
rate between the nivolumab-plus-ipilimumab 
group and the nivolumab monotherapy group; and 
the evaluation of tumor PD-L1 expression as a 
predictive biomarker for progression-free survival 
and overall survival.
Assessments
Overall survival was defined as the time from 
randomization to death, progression-free survival 
as the time from randomization to the first docu-
mented disease progression or death (whichever 
occurred first), and the objective response rate 
as the proportion of patients with a best overall 
response of partial or complete response. Tumor 
response was assessed by the investigators ac-
cording to the Response Evaluation Criteria in 
Solid Tumors (RECIST), version 1.1, at 12 weeks 
after randomization and then every 12 weeks until

progression or the discontinuation of treatment. 
Patients were followed for survival every 3 months 
until death, loss to follow-up, or withdrawal from 
the trial. Expression of PD-L1 on the surface of 
tumor cells was assessed in a central laboratory 
by means of immunohistochemical testing (Dako 
North America), as described previously.4 Adverse 
events and select adverse events (i.e., those with 
a potential immunologic cause) were graded ac-
cording to the National Cancer Institute Com-
mon Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, 
version 4.0.
Trial Oversight
The protocol and amendments for this trial (avail-
able with the full text of this article at NEJM.org) 
were reviewed by the institutional review board 
at each trial site. The trial was conducted in ac-
cordance with the provisions of the Declaration 
of Helsinki and with Good Clinical Practice 
guidelines as defined by the International Confer-
ence on Harmonisation. All the patients provided 
written informed consent before enrollment.
The trial was designed by the senior academic 
authors and the sponsor, Bristol-Myers Squibb. 
Data were collected by the sponsor and analyzed 
in collaboration with the authors. The authors 
vouch for the accuracy and completeness of the 
analyses and data reported and also confirm ad-
herence to the protocol. The initial manuscript 
was written in collaboration with the first author 
and last two authors, and all the authors con-
tributed to subsequent drafts and provided final 
approval to submit the manuscript for publica-
tion. Professional medical writing and editorial 
assistance were paid for by the sponsor.
A data and safety monitoring committee pro-
vided oversight to assess the risk–benefit profile 
of nivolumab combined with ipilimumab. The data 
and safety monitoring committee recommended 
the continuation of the trial without modification 
after each of the six formal meetings that were 
held during the trial. The committee had a final 
meeting on November 22, 2016, after the data-
base lock, because the trial met the primary end 
point regarding overall survival.
Statistical Analysis
Efficacy end points were based on the intention-
to-treat population. We calculated that the en-
rollment of approximately 915 patients would be 
required for the analysis of the two primary end 
points of progression-free survival and overall 
survival at an alpha level of 0.01 and 0.04, re-
spectively. Formal analyses of the two primary 
end points were conducted at different prespeci-
fied time points. The primary analysis of pro-
gression-free survival occurred after all the pa-
tients had 9 months of follow-up.4 The primary 
analysis of overall survival was to occur at 28 
months of follow-up, with 644 deaths being an-
ticipated to provide the trial with approximately 
99% power to detect a hazard ratio of 0.65 for 
each nivolumab-containing group versus the ipi-
limumab group. The actual number of observed 
events at the primary analysis of overall survival 
(467 deaths) was lower than anticipated but still 
provided the trial with more than 95% power to 
detect a difference between each nivolumab-con-
taining group and the ipilimumab group, with 
adjustment for multiple comparisons. Hochberg’s 
procedure11 was applied to address multiple com-
parisons and to control the overall type I error 
rate at 0.04 in the analysis of overall survival at 
28 months; a Bonferroni adjustment was used for 
the two treatment comparisons, resulting in 98% 
confidence intervals for the comparisons in the 
primary analysis of overall survival. A descriptive 
update of overall survival, progression-free sur-
vival, and the objective response rate with confi-
dence intervals reported at the 95% level (without 
formal hypothesis testing adjusted for multiple 
comparisons) was subsequently performed at a 
longer follow-up at 36 months. Confidence inter-
vals for objective response rates were calculated 
with the use of the Clopper–Pearson method. 
The trial design was not powered for a compari-
son between the nivolumab-plus-ipilimumab group 
and the nivolumab group, but descriptive analy-
ses without formal hypothesis testing were per-
formed. Additional statistical methods are de-
scribed in the Supplementary Appendix, available 
at NEJM.org.
Results
Patients and Treatment
This trial was conducted at 137 sites in 21 coun-
tries, and 1296 patients were enrolled from July 
2013 through March 2014. Of the 945 patients 
who underwent randomization (314 patients in 
the nivolumab-plus-ipilimumab group, 316 in the 
nivolumab group, and 315 in the ipilimumab 
group), 8 did not receive treatment (Fig. S1 in the

Supplementary Appendix). The demographic and 
clinical characteristics of the patients, which have 
been reported previously,4 were generally bal-
anced (Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix).
At the database lock on May 24, 2017, all living 
patients had a minimum follow-up of 36 months. 
The median follow-up was 38.0 months in the 
nivolumab-plus-ipilimumab group, 35.7 months 
in the nivolumab group, and 18.6 months in the 
ipilimumab group. Patients who had been assigned 
to receive combination therapy received a medi-
an of 4 doses (range, 1 to 94) of nivolumab and 
4 doses (range, 1 to 4) of ipilimumab, those as-
signed to the nivolumab group received a medi-
an of 15 doses (range, 1 to 94), and those as-
signed to the ipilimumab group received a median 
of 4 doses (range, 1 to 4). Patients who were 
treated beyond disease progression included 62 of 
313 patients (20%) in the nivolumab-plus-ipilim-
umab group, 97 of 313 (31%) in the nivolumab 
group, and 108 of 311 (35%) in the ipilimumab 
group.
Subsequent systemic therapy was administered 
in 32% of the patients in the nivolumab-plus-ipi-
limumab group, 46% of those in the nivolumab 
group, and 63% of those in the ipilimumab group 
(Table S2 in the Supplementary Appendix). The 
most common subsequent systemic therapies were 
BRAF inhibitors in the nivolumab-plus-ipilimumab 
group (13% of patients), anti–CTLA-4 agents in the 
nivolumab group (28%), and anti–PD-1 agents in 
the ipilimumab group (43%). In an analysis that 
excluded patients who had died and had not re-
ceived subsequent therapy, the median time to 
subsequent systemic therapy was not reached in 
the nivolumab-plus-ipilimumab group (258 pa-
tients) and was 25.5 months in nivolumab group 
(273 patients) and 8.1 months in the ipilimumab 
group (267 patients). The percentages of patients 
who were free from subsequent therapy at 3 years 
were 59% in the nivolumab-plus-ipilimumab 
group, 45% in the nivolumab group, and 20% in 
the ipilimumab group.
Efficacy
In the updated analysis, patients in the two 
nivolumab-containing groups continued to have 
higher rates of objective response than those 
who received ipilimumab: the rate of objective 
response was 58% in the nivolumab-plus-ipilim-
umab group and 44% in the nivolumab group, 
as compared with 19% in the ipilimumab group 
(Table 1). The rate of complete response was 19% 
in the nivolumab-plus-ipilimumab group and 16% 
in the nivolumab group, as compared with 5% in 
the ipilimumab group. The median duration of 
response was not reached in either nivolumab-
containing group and was 19.3 months in the 
ipilimumab group.
The median progression-free survival was 
11.5 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 8.7 
to 19.3) in the nivolumab-plus-ipilimumab group 
and 6.9 months (95% CI, 5.1 to 9.7) in the 
nivolumab group, as compared with 2.9 months 
(95% CI, 2.8 to 3.2) in the ipilimumab group 
(Fig. 1A). The hazard ratio for progression or 
death was 0.43 (95% CI, 0.35 to 0.52) with 
nivolumab plus ipilimumab versus ipilimumab 
(P<0.001) and was 0.55 (95% CI, 0.45 to 0.66) 
with nivolumab versus ipilimumab (P<0.001). 
The rate of progression-free survival at 3 years 
was 39% in the nivolumab-plus-ipilimumab group 
and 32% in the nivolumab group, as compared 
with 10% in the ipilimumab group. In a descrip-
tive analysis, the hazard ratio for progression or 
death was 0.78 (95% CI, 0.64 to 0.96) with 
nivolumab plus ipilimumab versus nivolumab. 
Among patients whose disease progressed, 56 of 
74 (76%) in the nivolumab-plus-ipilimumab 
group, 90 of 121 (74%) in the nivolumab group, 
and 120 of 159 (75%) in the ipilimumab group 
had at least one new lesion, including 8 of 74 
patients (11%), 21 of 121 (17%), and 23 of 159 
(14%), respectively, who had a new lesion in the 
central nervous system (Table S3 in the Supple-
mentary Appendix).
In the protocol-specified primary analysis of 
overall survival at a minimum follow-up of 28 
months, in which the actual number of deaths 
was 467 (as compared with the 644 deaths an-
ticipated), the two nivolumab-containing groups 
had significantly longer survival than the ipilim-
umab group. The rate of overall survival at 2 years 
was 64% in the nivolumab-plus-ipilimumab group 
and 59% in the nivolumab group, as compared 
with 45% in the ipilimumab group (hazard ratio 
for death with nivolumab plus ipilimumab vs. 
ipilimumab, 0.55 [98% CI, 0.42 to 0.72; P<0.001]; 
hazard ratio for death with nivolumab vs. ipilim-
umab, 0.63 [98% CI, 0.48 to 0.81; P<0.001]). In 
this 3-year analysis, the rate of overall survival at 
3 years was 58% in the nivolumab-plus-ipilim-

Overall Survival with Nivolumab and Ipilimumab in Melanoma
umab group and 52% in the nivolumab group, 
as compared with 34% in the ipilimumab group. 
The median overall survival was not reached in 
the nivolumab-plus-ipilimumab group (95% CI, 
38.2 months to not reached) but was reached in 
the nivolumab group (37.6 months; 95% CI, 29.1 
to not reached) and the ipilimumab group (19.9 
months; 95% CI, 16.9 to 24.6) (Fig. 1B). The 
hazard ratio for death with nivolumab plus ipi-
limumab versus ipilimumab was 0.55 (95% CI, 
0.45 to 0.69; P<0.001) and with nivolumab versus 
ipilimumab was 0.65 (95% CI, 0.53 to 0.80; 
P<0.001). In a descriptive analysis, the hazard ra-
tio for death with nivolumab plus ipilimumab 
versus nivolumab was 0.85 (95% CI, 0.68 to 1.07).
Numerically higher rates of progression-free 
survival and overall survival with the combina-
tion therapy over nivolumab monotherapy was 
seen in the majority of clinically relevant sub-
groups, including patients with BRAF mutations, 
those with stage M1c disease, and those with an 
elevated level of lactate dehydrogenase (Fig. 2). 
Survival outcomes favored the nivolumab-con-
taining groups over the ipilimumab group in all 
the subgroups that were evaluated (Fig. S2 in the 
Supplementary Appendix).
In the two nivolumab-containing groups, the 
median overall survival was not reached among 
patients with BRAF mutations, and the rate of 
overall survival at 3 years was 68% in the 
nivolumab-plus-ipilimumab group and 56% in 
the nivolumab group (Fig. 3A). In a descriptive 
analysis, the hazard ratio for death with nivolum-
ab plus ipilimumab versus nivolumab was 0.69 
(95% CI, 0.44 to 1.07). Among patients without 
BRAF mutations, the median overall survival was 
reached in all three treatment groups (Fig. 3B).
Additional analyses were performed to inves-
tigate efficacy according to the tumor PD-L1 ex-
pression level. Descriptive comparisons between 
the two nivolumab-containing groups suggest that 
as the data become more mature, better survival 
outcomes may be obtained with combination 
therapy than with monotherapy in patients with 
a lower tumor PD-L1 expression level (Fig. 2). 
However, overall survival was similar between 
the nivolumab-plus-ipilimumab group and the 
nivolumab group among patients with a tumor 
PD-L1 expression level of 1% or more or a level 
of 5% or more (Fig. 2, and Fig. S3 in the Supple-
mentary Appendix). The overall response rate 
was higher in the nivolumab-plus-ipilimumab

Figure 1. Kaplan–Meier Estimates of Survival.
Panel A shows the Kaplan–Meier estimates of progression‑free survival as assessed by the investigator. Patients were followed for a 
minimum of 36 months (dashed line). The median progression‑free survival was 11.5 months (95% CI, 8.7 to 19.3) in the nivolumab‑
plus‑ipilimumab group and 6.9 months (95% CI, 5.1 to 9.7) in the nivolumab group, as compared with 2.9 months (95% CI, 2.8 to 3.2) 
in the ipilimumab group. The rate of progression‑free survival at 2 years was 43% in the nivolumab‑plus‑ipilimumab group and 37% in 
the nivolumab group, as compared with 12% in the ipilimumab group. The 3‑year rate of progression‑free survival was 39% in the 
nivolumab‑plus‑ipilimumab group and 32% in the nivolumab group, as compared with 10% in the ipilimumab group. Panel B shows the

Overall Survival with Nivolumab and Ipilimumab in Melanoma
group than in the nivolumab group at each tu-
mor PD-L1 expression level tested (Table S4 in 
the Supplementary Appendix). Time-dependent re-
ceiver-operating-characteristic (ROC) curves were 
generated for overall survival outcomes at 3 years 
in order to assess the PD-L1 expression level that 
was associated with the longest survival. Area-
under-the-curve values, as compared with 0.5 (the 
line of no discrimination), were 0.56 (95% CI, 
0.49 to 0.63) in the nivolumab-plus-ipilimumab 
group (P 
= 
0.09) and 0.57 (95% CI, 0.50 to 0.63) 
in the nivolumab group (P 
= 
0.04), which indicate 
that the level of tumor PD-L1 expression alone is 
a poor predictive biomarker of overall survival 
(Fig. S4 in the Supplementary Appendix).12,13
Safety
Adverse events that were considered by the inves-
tigators to be related to treatment were reported 
in 96% of the patients treated with combination 
therapy, 86% of those treated with nivolumab, 
and 86% of those treated with ipilimumab; ad-
verse events of grade 3 or 4 occurred in 59%, 
21%, and 28%, respectively (Table 2, and Table S5 
in the Supplementary Appendix). Treatment-re-
lated adverse events of any grade that led to the 
discontinuation of therapy occurred more fre-
quently with combination therapy than with ei-
ther monotherapy (Table 2). Among 123 of 313 
patients (39.3%) who received a median of three 
doses of combination therapy and who discon-
tinued treatment owing to treatment-related ad-
verse events, 67% were still alive at 3 years. Se-
lect adverse events (i.e., those with a potential 
immunologic cause) of any grade occurred with 
a similar frequency in each cohort, as previously 
reported for the respective group (Table S6 in 
the Supplementary Appendix).4 The most common 
select adverse events of any grade were skin-related 
events, which occurred in 62% of the patients 
who received combination therapy, in 46% of 
those who received nivolumab monotherapy, and 
in 56% of those who received ipilimumab mono-
therapy. The most common select adverse events 
of grade 3 or 4 were gastrointestinal events, which 
occurred in 15% of the patients who received 
combination therapy, in 4% of those who received 
nivolumab monotherapy, and in 12% of those 
who received ipilimumab monotherapy (specifi-
cally, diarrhea in 9%, 3%, and 6% of the patients, 
respectively). Except for endocrine adverse events 
that may have led to long-term hormone therapy, 
most treatment-related select adverse events of 
grade 3 or 4 resolved within 3 to 4 weeks (Table S7 
in the Supplementary Appendix).
As previously reported,4 two deaths related to 
a study drug (as assessed by the investigator) 
occurred within 100 days after the last dose of 
study drug: one death due to neutropenia oc-
curred in the nivolumab group, and one due to 
colon perforation in the ipilimumab group. Two 
previously unreported deaths in the nivolumab-
plus-ipilimumab group that were considered by 
the investigator to be related to a study drug 
were reported more than 100 days after the last 
dose of study drug. A 72-year-old man with a 
history of heart disease died on day 589 (433 
days after receipt of the last dose) owing to car-
diac insufficiency and autoimmune myocarditis, 
approximately 2 months after receiving a single 
dose of anti–PD-1 therapy outside the context of 
the trial, and a 69-year-old woman died on day 
735 (234 days after receipt of the last dose) ow-
ing to liver necrosis, after she had grade 3 eleva-
tions in liver-enzyme levels.
Discussion
This analysis from the CheckMate 067 trial showed 
that combination therapy with nivolumab plus 
ipilimumab and monotherapy with nivolumab re-
sulted in significantly longer overall survival than 
ipilimumab monotherapy among patients with 
previously untreated advanced melanoma. The trial 
was not powered to compare the two nivolumab-
containing groups directly; however, in descrip-
tive analyses, the combination therapy resulted 
in a numerically higher rate of overall survival at 
3 years than nivolumab alone. The median over-
all survival has now been reached in the nivolu-
mab group but was still not reached in the nivol-
umab-plus-ipilimumab group after 36 months of 
follow-up. In a finding consistent with the initial 
report,4 the response rate remained numerically 
higher in the nivolumab-plus-ipilimumab group 
than in the nivolumab group.

Overall Survival with Nivolumab and Ipilimumab in Melanoma
Current evidence has shown that anti–PD-1 
therapy produces survival outcomes superior to 
ipilimumab therapy. In the KEYNOTE-006 trial, 
at a median overall survival of 32.3 months (95% 
CI, 24.5 to not reached), the rate of overall sur-
vival at 33 months was 50% in the pembroli-
zumab group and 39% in the ipilimumab group.6 
In the current analysis of the CheckMate 067 trial, 
the median overall survival in the nivolumab group 
was 37.6 months (95% CI, 29.1 to not reached), 
with 52% of the patients in the nivolumab group 
alive at 3 years, as compared with 34% of those 
in the ipilimumab group. In these two trials, pa-
tients whose disease had progressed during ipi-
lim 
umab therapy could have received subsequent 
anti–PD-1 agents. These results indicate similar 
survival outcomes with regard to the use of anti–
PD-1 agents as monotherapy. The survival rate at 
3 years was 58% among patients in the nivolumab-
plus-ipilimumab group. A much lower percent-
age of patients in the nivolumab-plus-ipilimu-
mab group than patients in the nivolumab group 
or the ipilimumab group had received a second-
line therapy at 3 years, a finding that needs to be 
factored into cost considerations of these therapies.
Although the trial was not designed to com-
pare the nivolumab-containing groups, the results 
regarding survival appeared to slightly favor com-
bination therapy over monotherapy across clini-
cally relevant subgroups, including subgroups of 
patients with a tumor PD-L1 expression level of 
less than 5% or less than 1%, with BRAF muta-
tions, and with elevated lactate dehydrogenase 
levels. The results we observed according to BRAF 
mutation status showed 3-year rates of 68% for 
overall survival and 40% for progression-free sur-
vival among patients with BRAF mutations who 
received nivolumab plus ipilimumab. In the phase 
3 COMBI-d trial involving patients with BRAF 
V600E or V600K–mutant metastatic melanoma, 
3-year rates of 44% for overall survival and 22% 
for progression-free survival were reported with 
the combination of dabrafenib plus trametinib.14 
To our knowledge, no trials have directly com-
pared the combination of nivolumab plus ipilim-
umab with dabrafenib plus trametinib in patients 
with melanoma and BRAF mutations.
Combination therapy resulted in a higher rate 
of objective response than nivolumab alone regard-
less of the tumor PD-L1 expression level. Data 
from a phase 1b study, CA209-038, showed that 
tumor PD-L1 expression is up-regulated to a 
greater extent with combination treatment than 
with nivolumab alone, concomitant with a greater 
increase in interferon-γ, CXCL9, and CXCL10 ex-
pression in the tumor microenvironment.15 The 
ROC-curve analyses did not identify a threshold 
of tumor PD-L1 expression for the discrimination 
of a difference in overall survival, which suggests 
that the tumor PD-L1 expression level alone may 
not be a definitive predictive biomarker of out-
comes in patients with advanced melanoma. In 
an analysis involving patients with a PD-L1 ex-
pression level of less than 1%, the separation of 
the overall survival curves between the nivolumab-
containing groups suggests that this biomarker 
may be a starting point for discussions with 
patients and families regarding the risk–benefit 
profile of combination therapy. In patients with 
a tumor PD-L1 expression level of 1% or more, 
the use of nivolumab monotherapy may be war-
ranted after a careful discussion of the risks and 
benefits of combination therapy.
As previously reported, the incidence of treat-
ment-related adverse events was higher with com-
bination therapy than with nivolumab or ipilim-
umab alone.4,10 The types and frequencies of events 
were consistent with previous results, and no new 
types of events occurred. Most immune-mediated 
adverse events resolved within 3 to 4 weeks when 
well-established safety guidelines (involving the 
use of immune-modulating agents as appropriate) 
were followed. These treatment guidelines require 
the close monitoring of immune-related adverse 
Figure 2 (facing page). Subgroup Analysis of Overall 
Survival and Progression-free Survival at 3 Years.
Shown are descriptive subgroup analyses of overall 
survival and progression‑free survival in prespecified 
subgroups of patients who received combination ther‑
apy with nivolumab plus ipilimumab (Nivo+Ipi), as 
compared with nivolumab monotherapy (Nivo). Re‑
sults are expressed as unadjusted hazard ratios in the 
analyses of progression‑free survival (hazard ratio for 
progression, relapse, or death) and overall survival 
(hazard ratio for death) among patients who received 
combination therapy with nivolumab plus ipilimumab, 
as compared with nivolumab monotherapy; the 3‑year 
rates of overall survival and progression‑free survival 
are also shown. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group 
(ECOG) performance‑status scores are assessed on a 
5‑point scale, with higher scores indicating greater dis‑
ability; a score of 0 indicates no symptoms, and 1 mild 
symptoms. LDH denotes lactate dehydrogenase, PD‑L1 
programmed death ligand 1, and ULN upper limit of 
the normal range.

events with an experienced team of health care 
providers to care for the patients and to provide 
detailed education to patients. The discontinua-
tion of therapy due to adverse events did not ap-
pear to compromise benefit with the combination 
therapy, because 67% of these patients were alive 
at 3 years despite having received three courses 
of treatment.
In conclusion, long-term survival outcomes oc-
curred with nivolumab plus ipilimumab combina-
tion therapy and with nivolumab alone in patients 
with previously untreated advanced melanoma. 
Figure 3. Overall Survival among Patients with or without BRAF Mutations.
Panel A shows the Kaplan–Meier estimates of overall survival among patients with BRAF mutations. Patients were followed for a mini‑
mum of 36 months (dashed line). The median overall survival was not reached in either nivolumab‑containing group and was 24.6 
months (95% CI, 17.9 to 31.0) in the ipilimumab group. Symbols (tick marks, triangles, and circles) indicate censored data. Panel B 
shows the Kaplan–Meier estimates of overall survival among patients without BRAF mutations. The median overall survival was 39.1 
months (95% CI, 27.6 to not reached) in the nivolumab‑plus‑ipilimumab group and 35.8 months (95% CI, 25.8 to not reached) in the 
nivolumab group, as compared with 18.5 months (95% CI, 14.1 to 22.7) in the ipilimumab group.

Shown are treatment‑related adverse events of any grade that occurred in more than 5% of the patients in any treatment group who had 
one or more treatment‑related adverse events of grade 3 or 4. The relatedness of the adverse event to treatment was determined by the in‑
vestigators. The severity of adverse events was graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse 
Events, version 4.0. Two deaths that were considered by the investigators to be related to a study drug occurred in the nivolumab group 
(neutropenia) and in the ipilimumab group (colonic perforation) within 100 days after the last dose of study drug; two additional deaths in 
the nivolumab‑plus‑ipilimumab group (one due to cardiac insufficiency and autoimmune myocarditis, and one due to liver necrosis) that 
were considered by the investigator to be related to a study drug were reported more than 100 days after the last dose of study drug.
