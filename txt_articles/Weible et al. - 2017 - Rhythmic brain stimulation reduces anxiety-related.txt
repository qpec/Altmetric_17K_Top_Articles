Meditation training induces changes at both the behavioral and
neural levels. A month of meditation training can reduce self-
reported anxiety and other dimensions of negative affect. It also can
change white matter as measured by diffusion tensor imaging and
increase resting-state midline frontal theta activity. The current
study tests the hypothesis that imposing rhythms in the mouse
anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), by using optogenetics to induce
oscillations in activity, can produce behavioral changes. Mice were
randomly assigned to groups and were given twenty 30-min
sessions of light pulses delivered at 1, 8, or 40 Hz over 4 wk or
were assigned to a no-laser control condition. Before and after the
month all mice were administered a battery of behavioral tests. In
the light/dark box, mice receiving cortical stimulation had more
light-side entries, spent more time in the light, and made more
vertical rears than mice receiving rhythmic cortical suppression or no
manipulation. These effects on light/dark box exploratory behaviors
are associated with reduced anxiety and were most pronounced
following stimulation at 1 and 8 Hz. No effects were seen related to
basic motor behavior or exploration during tests of novel object and
location recognition. These data support a relationship between
lower-frequency oscillations in the mouse ACC and the expression
of anxiety-related behaviors, potentially analogous to effects seen
with human practitioners of some forms of meditation.

O
ne month of integrated mind body meditation (1), a form of
mindfulness meditation, has been shown to reduce self-
reported anxiety as measured by the Profile of Mood States,
reduce the stress hormone cortisol, increase ventral anterior
cingulate cortex (ACC) activity, and change the white matter
pathways surrounding the ACC as measured by increased frac-
tional anisotropy in diffusion tensor imaging studies (1–4). How
might a purely mental exercise such as paying attention to the
present moment work to produce these changes in behavior and
brain connectivity (5)?
Some of these changes, including those to white matter, were
hypothesized to be related to the finding that meditation can in-
crease frontal theta activity even when the person is at rest (6). The
theta activity may increase the number of active oligodendrocytes
leading to increased myelination, thereby improving connectivity
between the ACC and other limbic areas. Moreover, theta activity
in humans has been uniquely correlated with glucose metabolism in
the ACC (7). Because the ventral ACC connects to the amygdala
and is thought to regulate its activity (8), these changes in the brain
could result in the reduced anxiety found following meditation
training.
To test this idea, we developed a mouse model in which various
frequencies of oscillatory activity were induced in the ACC using
optogenetics. Because mindfulness meditation has often been as-
sociated with reductions in anxiety and negative affect (9), we
examined exploratory behavior in the light/dark box. In this
ethological model of anxiety, time in the light versus dark sides is
thought to be a joint effect of novelty (favoring exploration of the
light side) and anxiety (favoring the dark) (10). Novel object and
location recognition memory also were tested as a measure of
cognitive change (11) because improved attention and memory also
have been reported following meditation training (9).
To drive rhythmic activity across the ACC, we used optogenetic
control of parvalbumin- expressing interneurons (PV-INs). Be-
cause PV-INs provide broad and potent inhibitory control over
pyramidal cells, their activation or inactivation can control global
levels of activity very effectively (12, 13). We used a PV-Cre driver
line together with either a Cre-dependent Archaerhodopsin-2
(Arch) line (14) or Cre-dependent Channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2)
line (15) to provide cell type-specific hyperpolarization or de-
polarization, respectively. Three crosses were bred: (i) PV-Arch,
in which light reduces PV-IN firing, thus stimulating global ACC
excitatory activity; (ii) PV-ChR2, in which light increases PV-IN
firing, thus suppressing global ACC excitatory activity; and (iii)
homozygous PV-PV, to control for nonspecific light effects. For
each cross, behavior also was assessed in control mice receiving no
light delivery (no-laser condition). We reasoned that increased
rhythmic output from the ACC would improve ACC connectivity
and thus reduce anxiety and improve cognitive performance.
Comparisons of PV-ChR2 and PV-PV mice enabled us to address
the relative importance of rhythmic stimulation versus suppression
of neural activity as well as any nonspecific laser effects.
Results
Here we evaluated the behavioral effects of optogenetically in-
ducing rhythms in the mouse ACC. Rhythmic increases in spiking
Significance
Meditation training has been shown to reduce anxiety, lower
stress hormones, improve attention and cognition, and increase
rhythmic electrical activity in brain areas related to emotional
control. We describe how artificially inducing rhythmic activity
influenced mouse behavior. We induced rhythms in mouse an-
terior cingulate cortex activity for 30 min/d over 20 d, matching
protocols for studying meditation in humans. Rhythmic cortical
stimulation was followed by lower scores on behavioral mea-
sures of anxiety, mirroring the reductions in stress hormones
and anxiety reported in human meditation studies. No effects
were observed in preference for novelty. This study provides
support for the use of a mouse model for studying changes in
the brain following meditation and potentially other forms of
human cognitive training.

 activity were induced in PV-Arch mice (n = 34) by delivering pulses
at 1 Hz (200 ms per pulse), 8 Hz (5 ms per pulse), or 40 Hz (5 ms
per pulse). Rhythmic decreases were induced in PV-Chr2 mice
(n = 27) at the same frequencies. Light pulses also were presented
to PV-PV mice (n = 15) lacking either optogenetic effector. Be-
haviors (Fig. S1) were quantified both before (Pre) and after (Post)
a 4-wk protocol of rhythmic light delivery. Behavior from each
cross was compared with a control group of mice (n = 25, drawn
from all three crosses) that underwent the same Pre and Post be-
havioral assessments without exposure to rhythmic light pulses.
Effects on Neural Activity. Two groups received equivalent total il-
lumination (1 Hz and 40 Hz, 200 ms per pulse), and two groups
received equivalent pulse durations (8 Hz and 40 Hz, 5 ms per
pulse) to account for those factors when assessing the effects of
each manipulation. Mean responses at each frequency are illus-
trated in Fig. 1. Recordings were from histologically verified ACC
neurons (Fig. S2A). Analyses compared (i) mean response ampli-
tude to the light pulse, i.e., baseline versus response intervals (Fig.
1) and (ii) cumulative changes in spiking output with rhythmic light
exposure (Fig. S2B).
In PV-Arch mice (n = 2), rhythmic light pulses induced robust
phase-locked increases in putative pyramidal neuron firing at each
frequency (Fig. 1 and Table S1). In PV-ChR2 mice (n = 2),
rhythmic light pulses induced phase-locked suppression in spiking
activity at each frequency (Fig. 1 and Table S1). No effects were
detected in neuronal activity of PV-PV mice (n = 4) (Fig. 1 and
Table S1). Therefore, our method of inducing rhythmic activity was
successful and specific to mice expressing either Arch or ChR2.
To determine if any of the differences found in behavior were
caused by changes in overall spiking output rather than by
rhythms, we examined the cumulative change in activity over a
5-min pulse interval compared with a 5-min baseline period (Fig.
S2B). In PV-Arch mice, rhythmic stimulation at 40 Hz produced
a cumulative increase in spiking output during the pulse interval
(SI Results, Effects on Neural Activity). In PV-ChR2 mice, rhythmic
suppression at both 1 Hz and 40 Hz produced a cumulative de-
crease in activity.
Behavior.
Light/dark box. The light/dark box is viewed as an ethological model of
anxiety (10), placing into competition the drives to remain safe and
to explore novel environments. The apparatus has two compartments
(Fig. S1), one dark and enclosed, the other well-lit with transparent
walls and an open top. Following 2 min of habituation in the dark, a
barrier between the two sides was removed, enabling the mouse to
explore the light side freely. Light-side exploration is typically re-
duced in anxious mice (10, 16). We held novelty constant by giving all
groups the same exposure to the experimental box, so differences
among groups following the laser treatment should reflect their rel-
ative anxiety. We analyzed the time to the first entry into the light
side (latency), the total number of entries into the light side (entries),
the time elapsed during exploration of the light side (duration), and
the total number of vertical rears (verticals) for PV-Arch (n = 34),
PV-ChR2 (n = 27), PV-PV (n = 15), and no-laser control mice
(n = 25) before (Pre) and after (Post) the 4-wk protocol.
ANOVAs revealed differences in exploratory behavior (Table
S2) between Pre and Post assessments that differed across
groups. Effects for time (Pre × Post) were highly significant for
all measures (all comparisons P < 0.0001). Each group exhibited
significant decreases for duration, total entries, and verticals
during the Post versus the Pre assessment (Table S3), repre-
senting a reduction in exploratory behavior. Significant interac-
tions (time × group) were seen for duration [F(3,97) = 5.81, P =
0.001] and total entries [F(3,97) = 3.6, P = 0.02], and a trend was
seen for latency (P = 0.10), indicating that the reduction in ex-
ploratory behavior differed in extent among groups. Interactions
also were seen when analyzing by frequency (time × frequency),
with significant effects for latency [F(11,89) = 2.37, P = 0.01],
total entries [F(11,89) = 3.53, P = 0.0004], and duration
[F(11,89) = 3.61, P = 0.0003] and a strong trend for verticals (P =
0.051). These decreases in exploratory behavior presumably
resulted from the apparatus no longer being novel, reducing the
impetus for exploration.
During the Pre assessment, light-side exploration was similar
among groups (Fig. S3 and Table S2). During the Post assessment,
however, PV-Arch mice that received rhythmic cortical stimulation
made more light-side entries, scored higher for duration, and
performed more verticals than mice from the other three groups
(Fig. 2, SI Results, Behavior, and Table S2), including no-stimula-
tion controls (no-laser group) and mice receiving rhythmic sup-
pression of cortical activity (PV-ChR2 group). The latency to first
light-side entry was largely similar among groups, although PV-PV
mice were significantly delayed compared with PV-Arch mice (df =
47, t = 2.2, P = 0.04). Therefore, PV-Arch mice exhibited greater
exploratory behavior following the 4-wk protocol.
The differences seen with PV-Arch mice during the Post as-
sessment were frequency specific (Fig. 3 and SI Results, Behavior).
Compared with the no-laser control group, mice exposed to 8-Hz
pulses consistently scored higher for total entries, duration, and
verticals. An increase in duration was also seen for mice exposed
to 1-Hz pulses. The mice exposed to 40-Hz pulses were similar to
the no-laser controls. These data demonstrate that increased ex-
ploration by PV-Arch mice during the Post assessment was asso-
ciated specifically with cortical stimulation at 1 Hz and 8 Hz.
No frequency-specific effects were seen for PV-ChR2 or PV-PV
mice relative to no-laser controls. Surprisingly, differences be-
tween frequencies were seen in the PV-PV group (Fig. 3, and SI
Results, Behavior). PV-PV mice exposed to 1-Hz pulses exhibited
more entries than mice exposed to 8-Hz pulses, in part because the

 mice exposed to 1-Hz pulses did not show a decline in entries
compared with the Pre assessment (entries Pre: 8.1 ± 1.1; Post: 7.9 ±
1.4). PV-PV mice exposed to 1-Hz and 40-Hz pulses both scored
higher for duration and verticals than mice exposed to 8-Hz pulses.
Motor output. To assess basic motor output, we examined move-
ment through a uniformly illuminated cylindrical arena (Fig. S1).
Quantified behaviors included total distance traveled (distance),
mean run speed (speed), total time immobile, number of im-
mobile periods, and number of rotations. The results are sum-
marized in Fig. 4 and Table S4.
ANOVAs revealed highly significant effects for time (Pre ×
Post) for all measures (all comparisons P < 0.0001) except rota-
tions. Significant interactions (time × group) were observed for
distance [F(3,97) = 2.91, P = 0.04], mean speed [F(3,97) = 3.1, P =
0.03], time immobile [F(3,97) = 4.5, P = 0.005], and total immobile
periods [F(3,97) = 6.0, P = 0.0009]. When separated by frequency
(time × frequency), significant interactions were seen for time
immobile [f(11,93) = 1.95, p = 0.04] and total immobile periods
[F(11,93) = 2.4, P = 0.01], with trends for distance (P = 0.10) and
mean speed (P = 0.08).
During the Pre assessment, behavior in the arena was compa-
rable among PV-Arch, PV-ChR2, PV-PV, and no-laser mice (Fig.
S4). Following the 4-wk protocol, PV-Arch, PV-ChR2, and no-
laser mice all demonstrated significant decreases in distance
traveled and mean speed and increases in immobile periods and
time immobile (all t test comparisons yielding P ≤ 0.0003; see
Table S4 for mean data). No-laser mice made fewer rotations
(df = 24, t = 2.3, P = 0.03), with trends toward a similar reduction
for PV-Arch and PV-ChR2 mice (P = 0.18 and P = 0.06, re-
spectively). The changes also were similar in magnitude, with no
significant between-group differences observed for any of the arena
behaviors. These changes indicate (i) that optogenetic manipula-
tion of ACC activity had no subsequent effect on spontaneous
motor output and (ii) reduced exploration of the arena that, as with
the Post light/dark box assessment, likely reflects the loss of novelty.
In contrast to the other three groups, the arena behavior of PV-PV
mice during the Post assessment was almost identical to that seen 4 wk
earlier during the Pre assessment (Table S4), resulting in the group
differences illustrated in Fig. 4. During the Post arena assessment, PV-
PV mice exhibited greater total distance traveled and greater mean
speed than PV-Arch, PV-ChR2, and no-laser mice (Fig. 4 and SI
Results, Behavior). PV-PV mice also exhibited fewer immobile periods
but more time immobile (Fig. 4 and SI Results, Behavior).
What might account for the differences in PV-PV motor output?
As noted above, PV-PV mice behaved similarly during Pre and
Post assessments, in contrast to PV-Arch, PV-ChR2, and no-laser
mice. When the data were broken down by frequency, no signifi-
cant differences were observed between Pre and Post assessments
for any behavior for PV-PV mice exposed to1 Hz, 8 Hz, or 40 Hz
pulses and no-laser mice. This result cannot be attributed simply to
the lower number of mice in each PV-PV group, because the SEs
observed at each frequency for each behavior Pre and Post are
comparable to those for the PV-Arch, PV-ChR2, and no-laser
groups (each of which dis have more mice per group). Therefore,
the difference in PV-PV motor output during the Post assessment
appears to be partly attributable to a difference specific to that
cross, rather than to an effect of light. However, during the Post
assessment, PV-PV mice exposed to 1-Hz pulses did score higher
than no-laser mice in distance traveled and mean speed (Fig. 5 and
SI Results, Behavior), indicating that an effect of laser cannot be
ruled out for some differences in PV-PV motor output.
Novel object and novel location recognition. To assess attention, basic
cognition, and short-term memory, we quantified novel object and
novel location recognition behavior (Fig. S1). During initial expo-
sure, mice explored a pair of objects (familiar) in the same arena in
which motor output data were collected. Next, mice explored one
familiar and one novel object to assess object recognition memory.
Finally, mice explored the same objects but with the familiar object
moved to a novel location. This sequence is illustrated in Fig. S1.
The time spent exploring each object was compared as a measure
of preference for one object/position over another.
ANOVAs revealed a significant effect for time (Pre × Post)

Increased exploration in PV-Arch mice was associated with 1-Hz and 8-Hz cortical stimulation. Compared with PV-Arch no-laser mice (NL, n = 11, cross-
hatched bars, left three panels), mice exposed to 8-Hz pulses (n = 13, black “8” bars) scored higher for total entries into the light side of the light/dark box,
total duration of light-side exploration, and total vertical rears. Additionally, mice exposed to 1-Hz pulses (n = 13, black “1” bars) scored higher for duration.
No differences were seen between PV-Arch exposed to 40-Hz pulses (n = 11, black “40” bars) and the no-laser control group (data not shown). For PV-ChR2
mice, no differences relative to the no-laser control group were seen at any frequency. For PV-PV mice, no differences relative to the no-laser control group
were seen at any frequency (n = 5, cross-hatched bars, right three panels), although some differences were seen for mice exposed to 1-Hz pulses (n = 5, white
“1” bars) and 40-Hz pulses (n = 5, white “40” bars) relative to mice exposed to 8-Hz pulses (n = 5, white “8” bars). Error bars indicate SEM. *P < 0.05; **P <

 P < 0.0001; novel location F = 5.8, P = 0.02), reflecting the
general decrease in the time spent exploring the objects during
the Post session (Table S5). A significant interaction (time ×
group) was detected for exploration of both objects during the
test of object recognition memory [familiar object: F(3,97) = 6.4,
P = 0.0005; novel object: F(3,97) = 3.6, P = 0.02]. An interaction
also was seen when sorting by frequency (time × frequency)
during this test [familiar object: F(11,89) = 3.3, P = 0.0008; novel
object: F(11,89) = 2.2, P = 0.02]. No interactions (by group or by
frequency) were detected for either object during the test of
location recognition memory.
During the Pre assessment, PV-Arch, PV-ChR2, and no-laser
mice all recognized the novel object (Fig. S5 and Table S6), whereas
PV-Arch, PV-ChR2, and PV-PV mice all recognized the novel
location. PV-PV mice and no-laser mice failed to exhibit object
recognition and location recognition, respectively, although in both
cases a modest preference for the novel stimulus was observed.
During the Post assessment, PV-Arch, PV-ChR2, and no-laser
mice explored the two initial exposure objects comparably (Table
S5), whereas PV-PV mice were biased toward the object serving as
the familiar stimulus in the subsequent object recognition test.
However, as with PV-Arch and PV-ChR2 mice, PV-PV mice
exhibited a significant preference for the novel object, indicating
that the bias seen during initial exposure did not interfere with, or
spuriously account for, novel object recognition (Table S6). No-
laser mice failed to exhibit significant object recognition behavior
following the 4-wk protocol, although a strong trend was observed
(P = 0.051) (Fig. 6). All four groups exhibited robust location
recognition behavior. Comparisons of the “strength” of novelty
preference, either as a ratio of novel/familiar or simple difference
between novel and familiar exploration times, yielded little evi-
dence of group effects. The ratio for novel object preference was
greater for PV-PV mice than for no-laser mice (df = 38, t = 2.2;
P = 0.04). The difference in novel location preference was greater
for no-laser mice than for PV-ChR2 mice (df = 50, t = 2.2, P =
0.03). No other differences in the strength of preference for either
object or location novelty were observed.
Discussion
In previous work it was found that integrated mind body medita-
tion training (20 sessions of 30 min each) reduced measures of
negative affect such as self-reported anxiety (1). Such training also
has been found to increase rhythmic activity in the ventral ACC
and improve connectivity in white matter tracts related to the ACC
(1, 3, 4). In the current study we examined how inducing rhythmic
activity at different frequencies in the mouse ACC influenced a
range of behaviors, including light/dark box exploration (an assay
of anxiety), motor output in the open arena, and novel object and
location recognition (tests of attention and short-term memory).
Each behavior was measured before and after 4 wk of rhythmic
manipulation of ACC activity. All mice, including the non-
stimulated controls, exhibited changes in behavior following the
4-wk protocol consistent with an overall reduction of exploration on
the second occasion of being tested compared with the first occa-
sion. However, we found that light/dark box exploration by PV-
Arch mice that underwent rhythmic stimulation remained elevated
compared with mice receiving rhythmic suppression or no manip-
ulation. In contrast, behavior of PV-Arch mice in the open arena
was comparable to each of the other groups, as was object explo-
ration and performance during the tests of recognition memory.
Given the absence of (i) a motor phenotype (e.g., hyperactivity),
(ii) any generalized changes in exploratory behavior, or (iii) evi-
dence of cognitive impairment or inability to recall past experience,
the data suggest that rhythmic cortical stimulation may facilitate a
reduction in anxiety. This finding supports our hypothesis that in-
creased output from the ACC would be critical to behavior change.
Nonetheless, we recognize that the light/dark box behavior is
complex and that other tests of anxiety, such as extinction of
conditioned fear, should be examined in future studies to help
further constrain the nature of the effects observed here.
The greater light/dark box exploration seen in PV-Arch mice
depended on the frequency of stimulation (Fig. 3). Stimulation at
8 Hz was associated with the most exploration. The effects of 1-Hz
stimulation were in the same direction as with 8-Hz stimulation
but were less robust. Stimulation at 40 Hz produced little or no
difference from no-light stimulation, indicating that the effects on
behavior were related to frequency rather than to the cumulative
increase in spiking output. The absence of a behavioral effect with
rhythmic suppression in PV-ChR2 mice confirms the importance
of phase-locked increases in spiking activity rather than simply the
induction of oscillations, per se. Overall, these data support our
prediction that 8-Hz (theta) stimulation would be most effective,
but the effect was not completely specific because 1-Hz stimula-
tion produced similar results.
What factor(s) might underlie the possible decreased anxiety
exhibited by PV-Arch mice following 1-Hz and 8-Hz stimulation?
According to some views, the ACC serves to regulate limbic areas
to which it is connected (8, 17). It is reasonable to propose that
altering the strength and/or efficiency of those connections could
influence behavior. Learning is associated with changes in synaptic
transmission that may be induced artificially with 1-Hz and 8-Hz
stimulation (18, 19). Learning also induces structural changes in
white matter (20–23). Recently, it was shown that these white
matter changes likely result from the formation of new myelin-
producing oligodendrocytes (24). Our stimulation of cortex at
1 Hz and 8 Hz may drive the generation of new oligodendrocytes,
resulting in increased myelination of fibers linking the ACC with

PV-PV mice exhibit distinct arena behavior following the 4-wk pro-

PV-PV mice exposed to 8-Hz (n = 5, “8” bars) or 40-Hz (n = 5, “40” bars)
pulses did not differ from the no-laser control group (n = 5, cross-hatched

 other limbic areas and consequently reducing anxiety-related be-
haviors. The effects of rhythmic cortical stimulation on light/dark
box exploration are consistent with ventral ACC involvement in
regulating anxiety, fear, and stress (25–29), and chronic exposure
to anxiety/stress induces changes in neurotransmission and long-
term potentiation in the rodent ACC (26, 30, 31). Validation of
the hypothesis linking 1- to 8-Hz cortical stimulation with in-
creased myelination and decreased anxiety will require quantifying
the generation of new oligodendrocytes and the density of myelin
in mice that undergo stimulation.
Demonstrating that rhythmic cortical stimulation had no effect
on motor output in the arena was essential for the interpretation
of the light/dark box results. The ACC is reciprocally connected
with primary and secondary motor areas and is often associated
with motor processes (32–35). In the mouse, secondary motor
cortex is situated immediately lateral to the ACC and likely was
exposed to light, albeit to a lesser degree, during the 4-wk pro-
tocol. Any hyper-locomotor activity or other motor phenotype
during the Post assessment would have complicated interpretation
of the light/dark box exploration data. The absence of any such
phenotype confirms the specificity of the effect to a reduction of
anxiety-associated behavior.
The absence of an effect on recognition memory did not match
our expectation based on previous observations of improved cog-
nition with meditation (1, 2). However, it fits with the finding that
meditation training, in comparison with relaxation, increased ac-
tivity in the ventral rather than the dorsal ACC. This part of the
ACC is connected with limbic areas and is thought to control mainly
emotional activity (8). Moreover, it is not inconsistent with the
broader literature. In rodents and humans, the ACC is active during
object exploration and exposure to novelty (36–43). However, it is
unclear whether the ACC is necessary for recognition memory (44–
46). Whether the stimulation protocol used here would improve
performance on more complex cognitive tasks or behaviors known
to be dependent on the ACC remains to be determined.
We consider some hypotheses for the results obtained with the
PV-PV animals. First, the Pvalb-IRES-Cre animals were origi-
nally generated by insertion of an internal ribosome entry site
(IRES)-Cre cassette into the 3′ UTR of the parvalbumin (Pvalb)
locus (47). Although this strategy effectively mimics the exact
expression of a gene, endogenous expression of the target locus
could be disrupted. That said, defects in endogenous parvalbumin
expression that could account for our results have not been
reported (48). Second, the PV, Arch, and ChR2 mouse lines,
although all maintained on a C57BL6/J background, have been
bred separately and thus could have undetected spontaneous
mutations that have become fixed (genetic drift) that could
result in physiological and behavioral differences. In light of
these possibilities, and given the absence of an effect on
spiking activity in PV-PV mice with light delivery, we feel the
line-specific no-laser controls are more relevant to the effect of
pulse frequency.
In previous work it was found that meditation training reduced
measures of negative affect such as self-reported anxiety (1).
Meditation training also has been found to increase activity in the
ventral ACC and to improve connectivity in white matter tracts
related to the ACC (1, 3, 4). Our current results show that
rhythmic stimulation of frontal cortical activity in an animal model
can produce some of the affective changes found in humans. It is
important to note that our previous studies of human meditation
used only one form of mindfulness training, and that other forms
of meditation have been associated with rhythmic changes in other
brain regions. For example, a study of experienced Buddhist
meditators found increases in gamma frequency rhythms in pari-
etal–occipital cortical regions (49). Nonetheless, although there is
no reason to believe that theta stimulation accounts for all the
effects of meditation, it may prove useful to have a plausible ac-
count of how meditation and lower frequency oscillations could
lead to such physical changes in the brain as altered white matter
(3, 4, 6). Future studies may examine the brain mechanisms that
support these behavioral changes in our mouse model. It also will
be possible to explore experimental manipulation of frontal theta
activity by less invasive external stimulation in humans as a further
test of the idea that frontal theta activity may be the effective
mechanism in changing white matter following meditation.
Methods
All studies were conducted with protocols approved by the University of Oregon
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees in compliance with National
Institutes of Health guidelines for the care and use of experimental animals.
Mice. We assessed the effects of rhythmic suppression or stimulation of
cortical activity in mice expressing the light-gated ion channel Channelrho-
dopsin-2 or the proton pump Archaerhodopsin in parvalbumin-positive in-
hibitory interneurons. Parents were homozygous for Pvalb-IRES-Cre (PV;
008069; The Jackson Laboratory), Rosa-CAG-LSL-ChR2(H134R)-EYFP-WPRE
(ChR2; 012569; The Jackson Laboratory), or Rosa-CAG-LSL-Arch-GFP-WPRE
(Arch; 012735; The Jackson Laboratory). Optogenetic suppression of the ACC
was performed using offspring heterozygous for both PV and ChR2 alleles
(PV-ChR2). Optogenetic stimulation was performed using offspring hetero-
zygous for both PV and Arch alleles (PV-Arch). Mice homozygous for Pvalb-
IRES-Cre (PV-PV) were used to control for nonspecific effects of pulsed light
delivery. Data were collected from both male and female mice aged 8–12 wk
at the time of surgery. A total of 47 PV-Arch, 38 PV-ChR2, and 25 PV-PV mice
were included in the behavioral and single-neuron recording experiments.
Surgery. To study the behavioral effects of rhythmic cortical activity ma-
nipulations, mice were implanted with a two-by-two array of optic fibers
(200-μm diameter) overlying each hemisphere of the ACC. For recording
single-neuron activity, a four-tetrode array with a single 200-μm optic fiber
was implanted in the ACC.
Behavioral Data Acquisition and Stimulus Delivery. Mice were run through a
sequence of five 5-min assessments both before and after a 4-wk protocol (for a
detailed description, see SI Methods and Fig. S1. The only changes before (Pre)
and after (Post) the 4-wk protocol were in the set of objects used and their
positions on the arena floor relative to the visual cues during assessments 3–5
(i.e., one set of objects was used before the 4-wk protocol, and another set was
used after the protocol). For optogenetic manipulations, 520-nm wavelength
modules were set to 9.5 mW for PV-Arch mice, and 445-nm wavelength
modules were set to 6.3-mW for PV-ChR2 mice. The effective spread for each
wavelength at these intensities is 1.5 mm in diameter (14, 50, 51).

Rhythmic manipulation of cortical activity did not alter object or
location recognition memory. Mice were tested for novel object and novel
location recognition memory before and after the 4-wk protocol. Greater
exploration times are interpreted as novelty recognition. Following the 4-wk
protocol (Post), PV-Arch (n = 34, black bars), PV-ChR2 (n = 27, gray bars), and
PV-PV (n = 15, white bars) mice all recognized the novel object; a strong
trend toward object recognition (P = 0.051) was also exhibited by no-laser
mice (n = 25, cross-hatched bars). All four groups exhibited robust location
recognition. a, b: positions corresponding to familiar and novel objects, re-
spectively, during the object recognition test; b, c: positions corresponding
to the familiar and novel locations, respectively, during the location recog-
nition test. Error bars indicate SEM. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001.

 Assessments 1 and 3–5 were hand-scored separately by at least two viewers
blind to experimental condition. Assessment 2 was quantified by the com-
mercial tracking software package Any-maze (Stoelting Co.). All analyses of
behavioral data were performed using the statistical analysis program Stat-
View. ANOVAs were used to assess effects of time (Pre versus Post) and in-
teractions by group or frequency. Paired t tests were used to assess within-
group differences following the 4-wk protocol. Unpaired t tests were used for
between-group comparisons and for within-group comparisons for frequency
effects versus no-laser controls (for details, see SI Methods).
Single-Neuron Recording and Analysis. Single-neuron data were analyzed during a
5-min baseline interval followed by a 5-min pulsed-light interval for each fre-
quency. Data were collected from each mouse at 1-Hz, 8-Hz, and 40-Hz pulse
frequencies. For PV-PV mice, data were collected using either 445-nm or 520-nm
wavelength light to control for nonspecific wavelength effects. Analyses were
limited to well-isolated putative pyramidal neurons [see SI Methods for
interneuron exclusion criteria and cluster isolation metrics (52–54)]. Mean firing
rates were calculated for each 5-min interval and were analyzed using paired t
tests. To identify significant phase-locked changes in firing rate associated with
the laser, paired t tests compared spiking activity during a 10-ms response in-
terval 6–15 ms following the onset of each laser pulse with a 10-ms baseline
interval immediately preceding each pulse (the 5-ms interval following the pulse
was excluded to control for potentially confounding photoelectric artifacts).
Unpaired t tests were used for between-frequency and between-group com-
parisons. Between-group comparisons for the size of the change were calcu-
lated using a simple difference between response and baseline firing rates.
