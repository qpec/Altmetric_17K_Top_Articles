Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a major cause of chronic liver disease. There is uncertainty around the
economic burden of NAFLD. We constructed a steady-state prevalence model to quantify this burden in the United
States and Europe. Five models were constructed to estimate the burden of NAFLD in the United States and four
European countries. Models were built using a series of interlinked Markov chains, each representing age increments
of the NAFLD and the general populations. Incidence and remission rates were calculated by calibrating against real-
world prevalence rates. The data were validated using a computerized disease model called DisMod II. NAFLD
patients transitioned between nine health states (nonalcoholic fatty liver, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis [NASH], NASH-
fibrosis, NASH-compensated cirrhosis, NASH-decompensated cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, liver transplanta-
tion, post-liver transplant, and death). Transition probabilities were sourced from the literature and calibrated against
real-world data. Utilities were obtained from NAFLD patients using the Short Form-6D. Costs were sourced from the
literature and local fee schedules. In the United States, over 64 million people are projected to have NAFLD, with
annual direct medical costs of about $103 billion ($1,613 per patient). In the Europe-4 countries (Germany, France,
Italy, and United Kingdom), there are ~52 million people with NAFLD with an annual cost of about e35 billion (from
e354 to e1,163 per patient). Costs are highest in patients aged 45-65. The burden is significantly higher when societal
costs are included. Conclusion: The analysis quantifies the enormity of the clinical and economic burdens of NAFLD,
which will likely increase as the incidence of NAFLD continues to rise. (HEPATOLOGY 2016;64:1577-1586).
N
onalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a
major cause of chronic liver disease. In a
recent systematic review, the global preva-
lence of NAFLD was estimated to be approximately
24%.(1) NAFLD is predominantly associated with
obesity and type 2 diabetes.(1) In addition to the Unit-
ed States and Europe, high prevalence rates of obesity
have been reported from South America, Asia, and the
Middle East.(1,2)
In order to fully understand the clinical burden of
NAFLD, it is important to recognize the full spectrum
of the NAFLD phenotype.(2) Histologically, the
potentially progressive form of NAFLD has been
referred to as nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).(2)
Although NASH represents the minority (10%-20%)
of patients with NAFLD, the NASH subtype can
potentially progress to advanced liver disease, leading
to cirrhosis, liver-related mortality, and hepatocellular
carcinoma (HCC).(1-5) Despite NASH being a more
progressive type of NAFLD, the non-NASH type of
NAFLD still carries a clinical burden as it is associated
with cardiovascular diseases and complications.(6)

MERICAN ASSOCIATION FOR
 Clinically, NASH seems to be more common and
potentially more progressive in the setting of insulin
resistance and diabetes mellitus.(7) Other studies have
also shown that diabetes mellitus is an independent
predictor of advanced fibrosis and long-term mortality
in NAFLD.(8,9) In addition, the presence of advanced
fibrosis (stage �2) in NAFLD has been associated
with increased liver-related mortality.(10,11) These data,
therefore, may be an indicator that grade of fibrosis is a
surrogate for predicting liver-related mortality.
In addition to cirrhosis, there is mounting evidence
that
NAFLD
is
an
important
risk
factor
for
HCC.(12,13) Although cirrhosis in NASH has been
indicated as a risk factor for HCC, there is some evi-
dence to suggest that NAFLD patients without cirrho-
sis may also be at risk of developing HCC.(14) Finally,
the clinical outcome of NAFLD has led to a large
number of liver transplants (LTs) in the United States.
In fact, NASH is now considered the second most
common indication for LT in the United States after
chronic hepatitis C and is growing.(15)
In addition to its clinical impact, NAFLD has an
impact on patient-reported outcomes.(16) In fact,
recent data suggest that NAFLD patients may have
significant impairment of their physical health as mea-
sured by two patient-reported quality-of-life measure-
ment tools, the Short Form-36 and the Chronic Liver
Disease Questionnaire.(17) Finally, NAFLD has been
shown to have an important economic impact on
health care use.(16) In a recent study of Medicare
NAFLD patients, the mean yearly inflation-adjusted
charges from the outpatient setting increased from
$2,624 6 $3,308 in 2005 to $3,608 6 $5,132 in 2010,
in dollars of 2010.(18) In a follow-up study of both out-
patient and inpatient Medicare resource use, the enor-
mous impact of NAFLD was reiterated and the
median total hospital charge for NAFLD patients was
$36,289 in 2010.(19)
In the context of growing clinical and quality-of-life
burden of NAFLD, the economic burden of this
important liver disease for the United States and Europe
is likely to increase. Therefore, our aim was to estimate
the clinical and economic burdens of NAFLD in the
United States and four European countries using a deci-
sion analytic Markov-based model.
Materials and Methods
MODEL STRUCTURE AND
ASSUMPTIONS
Five separate models were constructed to estimate
the clinical and economic burdens of NAFLD in the
United States and four European countries (Europe-
4): France, United Kingdom, Germany, and Italy.
Each model was constructed using a series of inter-
linked Markov chains in Microsoft Excel spreadsheets,
using the general structure shown in Fig. 1, which
depicts a Markov model for the general population.
Within the general population, individuals were classi-
fied into four possible states: susceptible, NAFLD,
NAFLD-specific deaths, and all-cause deaths. Indi-
vidual transition probabilities between these states
were calculated by applying incidence, remission, mor-
tality, and NAFLD-specific mortality rates.(1-15)
As NAFLD is a progressive disease, an embedded
disease-specific Markov structure allowed for patients
with NAFLD to transition to different liver disease
health states (Fig. 2): nonalcoholic fatty liver (NAFL,
with no progression) and noncirrhotic NASH (with
no fibrosis [FB] and FB substates), which could pro-
gress to compensated cirrhosis (CC), decompensated
cirrhosis (DCC), HCC, LT, post-LT (PLT), and
death. The remission rate was applied only to those in
the NAFL health state, and case fatality was applied
using the transition probabilities to death from DCC,

 HCC, LT, and PLT. While remission was only
allowed in the NAFL health state, regression was per-
mitted from CC to FB, FB to no FB, and no FB to
FB; therefore, patients could indirectly transition from
these health states to the general population.(1-15,20-31)
Using this framework, the number of cases in each
of the liver disease states was estimated by following a
susceptible cohort over time and applying the transi-
tion probabilities as described below. Cohorts of
patients were followed in 5-year bands. It is important
to note that including patients aged under 20 may
introduce confounding due to those with potential
inherited metabolic disorders associated with early
NAFLD; however, this population was still included
for completeness of the model. The prevalence of each
disease state at a certain age was calculated by applying
the incidence, mortality, and disease transition proba-
bilities to the prevalent population of the previous age.
As such, under the conditions of static incidence, mor-
tality, and disease transition probabilities with respect
to time, a patient’s age is equal to the cycle number of
the model and the model is at steady state.(1-15,20-31)
CLINICAL INPUTS
Different age intervals were used for the clinical
inputs within the model; country-specific background
mortality rates were applied in 5-year intervals and
sourced from publically available databases (Supporting
Table S1).(20,21) Incidence rates were applied in 5-year
intervals and calculated using the calibration method
described below; 5-year age bands were selected for
these parameters as they were not expected to vary sig-
nificantly within these bands.(20,21)
Given the limited amount of data available for the
age-specific natural history of NAFLD, a base transi-
tion matrix without regard to age was built from the
published
literature
(Supporting
Table
S2)(22-31);
where data gaps existed, values were imputed from the
primary sources used in a recent cost-effectiveness
analysis of patients with hepatitis C.(32) These proba-
bilities were then varied over four distinct age bands
(<20, 20-44, 45-64, and 651) by applying relative
risks (RRs) to the base transition matrix. The age-
specific RRs for all progressive transition probabilities
with the exception of transition to LT were based on
risk of death PLT obtained from the United Network
for
Organ
Sharing
database
(Supporting
Table
S3).(30,31) The RRs for probability of LT were calculat-
ed by adjusting for the number of LTs due to NAFLD
by age relative to all of the LTs due to NASH in the
United States in 2014, as sourced from United Net-
work for Organ Sharing (Supporting Table S3).(30,31)
Gender-specific adult NAFLD prevalence rates for
the United States were obtained from the National

and
Nutrition
Examination

 of 1.45 to reflect the difference between these preva-
lence rates and the rates reported in a recent meta-
analysis.(1,31) These prevalence rates were assumed to
be the same in Europe as prevalence rates were
reported to be similar.(1)
Utilities were obtained directly from NAFLD
patients using Short Form-6D scores (Supporting
Table S5).
COSTING INPUTS
In the model’s base case, both direct medical costs
and societal costs were considered. Conservatively,
additional costs due to the presence of comorbid con-
ditions (e.g., treatment costs, complication costs) were
not modeled.
Annual costs of each health state at a macro level
were sourced from recent publications (Supporting
Table S4).(33-38) Costs for patients in lesser-progressed
model health states were micro-costed using resource
use inputs from hepatology experts mapped to national
fee schedules. For the US analysis, annual hospitaliza-
tion costs for NAFLD without cirrhosis were obtained
from a recent Medicare cost analysis,(18,19) and those
costs were assumed to apply across all NAFL and non-
cirrhotic NASH health states. Hospitalization costs
were adjusted for European markets using an adjust-
ment factor.
Societal costs were calculated by estimating the annu-
al quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) lost due to
NAFLD and by applying a monetary value to this
QALY estimate. QALYs were measured by assigning
utility scores of between 1 (perfect health) and 0 (death)
to each NAFLD health state and multiplying the utility
scores by survival, weighted by health state. QALYs lost
were calculated as the difference between the projected
QALYs in the NAFLD population and the projected
QALYs in the general population, weighted by age, as
sourced
from
the
National
Health
Measurement
study.(31,39-45) This difference was then multiplied by
the monetary value of a QALY. Monetary values were
assigned using thresholds at which payers are willing to
pay for additional QALYs gained for new interventions.
In the United States, interventions are typically accepted
as being cost-effective where the cost per additional
QALY gained is less than $50,000 to $150,000, but
there have been calls for this value to be set much
higher, valuing QALYs at up to $300,000. In the Unit-
ed Kingdom, interventions are accepted as cost-effective
if the cost per QALY gained is less than £30,000 or
£50,000 where the intervention is classified as end-of-
life care. In Europe, willingness-to-pay thresholds are
less commonly used to make reimbursement decisions,
but interventions are typically accepted as cost-effective
where the value per QALY gained ranges between
e75,000 and e125,000. In our analysis, the values per
QALY gained were therefore set at $50,000 (United
States), e75,000 (Germany, France, Italy), and £30,000
(United Kingdom) in the base case. The utility scores
were directly obtained in patients with NAFLD (Sup-
porting Table S5).(16,29,43-45)
MODEL VALIDATION
The outer Markov model was validated using Dis-
Mod II, a generic mathematical disease model pub-
lished by the World Health Organization (Table
1).(46-48) DisMod II numerically solves a set of linear
differential equations that describe the transitions
between states as represented in Figs. 1 and 2 using a
finite differences method. DisMod II is able to calcu-
late incidence rates from given prevalence, general
mortality, remission, and RR mortality data. The
remission rate was assumed to be 20%, an estimate
provided by experts. The RR for NAFLD excess mor-
tality by age was obtained from the NHANES data-
base adjusted using an RR factor as described above.
Within DisMod II, a polynomial curve was fitted to
the prevalence data sourced from NHANES for four
age bands, and the incidence rates which were calculat-
ed by DisMod II were used as inputs into our model.
An additional validation step compared (by visual
inspection) the NAFLD prevalence rates generated by
our model versus those generated by DisMod II (Sup-
porting Fig. S1).
MODEL CALIBRATION
Using the global criterion method,(48) the model
was calibrated against several empirical real-world data
targets, which were obtained from the literature
(Supporting Table S6).(23,30-32,47,49) The calibration
procedure used the generalized reduced gradient non-
linear optimization routine that is available in the
SOLVER add-in that comes packaged with Microsoft
Excel. Model input parameters were allowed to vary
within a set of given constraints (Table 2). Calibration
factors to the NAFLD incidence rates across the four
age bands used in the prevalence calibration targets
(Supporting Table S6) were applied, which allowed for
matching to real-world prevalence data rather than the
smoothed DisMod II data.(33,43-45) Model residual

 errors were calculated by subtracting the model output
value from the calibration target value. These were
squared and summed to provide an objective minimi-
zation target. The model’s clinical inputs were calibrat-
ed for the US population and applied unchanged to
the European countries. The inputs and outputs of the
model calibration are provided in Table 2.
SENSITIVITY ANALYSES
One-way deterministic sensitivity analyses were per-
formed to test the impact of model parameters on
results; all model parameters were varied 620%, with
the exception of utility values, where inputs from a
hepatitis C virus patient population were used as an
upper bound, and societal costs, where values of
$300,000
(United
States),
e125,000
(Germany,
France, Italy), and £50,000 (United Kingdom) were
used.
Results
MODEL CALIBRATION AND
VALIDATION
NAFLD incidence rates predicted from DisMod
II(24,25) (Table 1) were in line with the few real-world
NAFLD incidence estimates available, which range
from 2% to 5% according to recent studies.(1,4)
Further,
when
comparing
our
model’s
projected
NAFLD prevalence to DisMod’s calculation based on
NHANES data, the two models give similar age-
prevalence curves as assessed by visual inspection
(Supporting Fig. S1). However, our model slightly
underpredicts NAFLD prevalence relative to DisMod
II. This is not surprising given the differences between
the models, such as the way that case mortality data are
estimated and how case remission is applied: in Dis-
Mod II remission and case mortality are applied equal-
ly across the NAFLD population, while in our model
remission is only applied in the NAFL health state
and case mortality varies by health state, increasing
with disease progression.
Upon calibration, our model’s outputs were closely
matched to multiple US real-world targets (Supporting
Table S6) while keeping input parameters in ranges
bound by literature estimates and expert opinion
(Table 2).(23,30-32,47,49)
CLINICAL BURDEN OF DISEASE
The annual clinical burden of NAFLD is projected
to be substantial in both the United States and the
Europe-4. In the United States, over 12 million inci-
dent cases of NAFL and over 600,000 incident cases
of NASH are predicted, with proportionally similar
results in the Europe-4 (Supporting Table S7). A sig-
nificant number of newly progressed cases of cirrhosis
(both CC and DCC), HCC due to NAFLD, and LT
due to NAFLD are also projected (Supporting Table
S7). Incident cases of disease peak in the 45-64 age
group (Supporting Table S8).
Trends in projected disease prevalence are similar,
with nearly 64 million people in the United States pro-
jected to have NAFLD (Table 3), with results

 proportionally similar in the Europe-4. The majority
of NAFLD patients (91.3%) have not yet progressed
to NASH, given the slow progressive nature of the dis-
ease. Prevalent cases of disease peak in the 45-64 age
group (Table 4).
ECONOMIC BURDEN OF DISEASE
In line with our clinical estimates, the annual eco-
nomic burden of NAFLD is projected to be substantial
in both the United States and the Europe-4. The total
burden is higher in the United States ($103 billion/
year in direct costs) relative to the Europe-4 due to the
larger population (where it was e27.7 billion in
Germany, France, and Italy together and £5.24 billion
in the UK), as well as higher costs of managing
disease-related complications, which also increase the
per-patient costs (Table 5). Total costs were the high-
est in patients aged 45-65, mirroring the disease preva-
lence (Table 6). However, per-patient costs were the
highest in the 651 age group, reflecting the higher
proportion of these patients in more advanced stages of
disease (data not shown). Accounting for societal costs

 would significantly increase the total burden of disease
in all markets (Table 5). The differences in direct eco-
nomic burden between countries are reflective of the
different component costs of care; differences in pro-
jected societal burden reflect differences in willingness
to pay per QALY gained in these markets.
SENSITIVITY ANALYSES
Given that NAFL was the NAFLD patient seg-
ment with the highest prevalence relative to more pro-
gressed states of NAFLD (NASH with fibrosis,
NAFLD CC, DC, HCC, and LT), our model was
most sensitive to parameters impacting this state,
including the rate of remission to a disease-free state,
NAFL monitoring costs, and NAFL transition proba-
bilities. As expected, the incident rate of disease was
also a significant model driver across all age bands
(Supporting Fig. S2).
Discussion
This is the most extensive study assessing the eco-
nomic and clinical burdens of NAFLD in the United
States and four major European countries. Our model
estimates that there are 64 million individuals with
NAFLD in the United States and 52 million in the
four European countries. Our model also provides an
estimate for the number of patients who will develop
new NAFLD complications on an annual basis for the
United States and the Europe-4. These analyses sug-
gest that the clinical burden of NAFLD in the United
States and Europe is tremendous and potentially
growing.
As the clinical consequences of NAFLD grow, the
economic consequences will also increase. Our previ-
ous work determined that the discounted lifetime cost
of a cohort of incident newly diagnosed NAFLD
patients is $5.8 billion in the United States.(29) Our
current work extends these findings, estimating the
annual burden associated with all incident and preva-
lent NAFLD cases in the United States at $103 billion

 in the Europe-4 countries at e35 billion—in line with
estimates of the economic burden associated with dia-
betes and heart disease.(50) Using standard discounting
assumptions, this would result in a 10-year economic
burden of NAFLD of $908 and e302 billion, respec-
tively, in the United States and the Europe-4, assum-
ing a constant incidence of disease. However, if we
assume the annual rate of increase in the costs due to
NAFLD to parallel the annual growth in the preva-
lence of obesity in the United States since 1994,(51) the
expected 10-year burden of NAFLD could increase
substantially—to an estimated $1.005 trillion in the
United States and e334 billion in the Europe-4.
In addition to the direct annual cost of NAFLD,
there is a societal cost related to the loss of QALYs
due to NAFLD and its complications. By assigning a
monetary value to societal costs and adding these to
the annual direct cost of NAFLD for the United States
and the Europe-4, the total annual cost of NAFLD
can be estimated at $292.19 billion and e227.84 bil-
lion, respectively. Furthermore, these cost calculations
do not take into account other indirect costs of
NAFLD which are related to work productivity loss
and its economic impact. Treatment costs were not
included in this model as, unlike for viral hepatitis and
other etiologies of chronic liver disease, there are cur-
rently no effective therapies approved for the treatment
of NAFL or NASH. However, as there are a signifi-
cant number of therapies currently under investigation,
this may substantially change the cost burden of
NAFLD in the future.
Our model structure was designed to comprehen-
sively project NAFLD burden of disease by simulating
movement between the diseased and nondiseased pop-
ulations through incidence, progression, and remis-
sion/regression across multiple patient age bands by
interlinking Markov chains. However, our analysis is
subject
to several limitations.
First, an
inherent
assumption of using a steady-state model is that the
incidence and prevalence have reached a steady state;
our results may, therefore, underestimate the true
future burden of NAFLD, particularly in older age
groups where the impact of changing incidence has
not yet been realized. Additionally, substantial uncer-
tainty around many inputs existed, particularly the
NAFLD incidence and the rates of fibrosis progres-
sion; further research is required to validate these
parameters, although we calibrated the most uncertain
inputs within an appropriate range to approach real-
world targets and, thus, believe that the impact of this
on our model results is not substantial. Further, the
model was calibrated using the real-world prevalence
data for the United States and assumed the same inci-
dence and disease progression across the Europe-4.
The impact of this approach is expected to be minimal
given that European NAFLD prevalence rates were
reported to be similar to those for the United States.(1)
Finally, most of the studies included in this analysis
focused on individuals with NAFLD alone, which
does not consider that concurrent NAFLD can also
occur among patients with coexisting liver disease eti-
ologies, specifically chronic hepatitis B virus and
chronic hepatitis C virus. This cost could not be quan-
tified in the analysis given the lack of complete data
about NAFLD superimposed on other types of chron-
ic liver disease. However, if these costs had been
included,
the
clinical
and
economic
burdens
of
NAFLD projected by our model would certainly be
significantly increased.
It is important to note that some discrepancy may
exist between the prevalence rates for NASH in
NAFLD reported in the literature and those calculated
by our model. This is related to our approach for cali-
brating the model which allowed the model inputs,
sourced from the literature, to target a range of preva-
lence rates obtained from real world data and/or cited
in the literature. The model inputs and calibration
range are listed in Table 2. The target outputs are
listed in Supporting Table 6, and included a prevalence
rate of NASH in NAFLD of 20%, as well prevalence
rates for other model health states sourced from real-
world databases (UNOS and NHANES) or the
literature.
The model was calibrated by minimizing the sum of
the residual square errors between the model outputs
and a series of real world derived target outputs. This
fitting procedure predicted a prevalence rate of NASH
in NAFLD (Supporting Table 6). This is lower than
our target output of 20%. However, our model sug-
gests that any prevalence rate for NASH in NAFLD
higher than this conflicts with achieving other real-
world targets, particularly currently prevalence rates for
NAFLD and prevalence of HCC in NAFLD.
As has been discussed in the preceding paragraphs,
it is recognized that this approach may underestimate
the prevalence of NAFLD and NASH in NAFLD.
Nevertheless, we decided to take a more conservative
approach to this model output.
In summary, this is the first comprehensive model
estimating the clinical and economic burdens of
NAFLD. Despite the enormous economic burden
estimated by this analysis, it is most likely that we have
YOUNOSSI ET AL.

 underestimated the economic burden of the disease
due to conservative assumptions related to the clinical
burden and the disease progression rates. Nevertheless,
our analysis provides an economic basis to appreciate
the actual burden of NAFLD, NASH, and their com-
plications to society. Given the epidemic of NAFLD,
understanding the full burden of NAFLD will help
providers, payers, and policy makers to develop strate-
gies to identify high-risk patients with NAFLD and to
implement a multipronged public health policy to deal
with this important chronic liver disease.
