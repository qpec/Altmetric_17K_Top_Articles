Abstract
It is not known if breakfast consumption is an effective intervention for altering daily energy balance in adolescents when compared with
breakfast omission. This study examined the acute effect of breakfast consumption and omission on free-living energy intake (EI) and physical
activity (PA) in adolescent girls. Using an acute randomised cross-over design, forty girls (age 13·3 (SD 0·8) years, BMI 21·5 (SD 5·0) kg/m2)
completed two, 3-d conditions in a randomised, counter-balanced order: no breakfast (NB) and standardised (approximately 1962 kJ)
breakfast (SB). Dietary intakes were assessed using food diaries combined with digital photographic records and PA was measured via
accelerometry throughout each condition. Statistical analyses were completed using repeated-measures ANOVA. Post-breakfast EI was 483
(SD 1309) kJ/d higher in NB v. SB (P = 0·025), but total daily EI was 1479 (SD 11311) kJ/d higher in SB v. NB (P < 0·0005). Daily carbohydrate,
fibre and protein intakes were higher in SB v. NB (P < 0·0005), whereas daily fat intake was not different (P = 0·405). Effect sizes met the
minimum important difference of ≥0·20 for all significant effects. Breakfast manipulation did not affect post-breakfast macronutrient intakes
(P ≥ 0·451) or time spent sedentary or in PA (P ≥ 0·657). In this sample of adolescent girls, breakfast omission increased post-breakfast
free-living EI, but total daily EI was greater when a SB was consumed. We found no evidence that breakfast consumption induces
compensatory changes in PA. Further experimental research is required to determine the effects of extended periods of breakfast
manipulation in young people.
Key words: Breakfast: Children: Exercise: Health: Nutrition: Youth
There is a common belief that breakfast is the ‘most important
meal of the day’(1). However, about one-third of young people,
including children (pre-pubertal and typically <11 in girls and
<13 years in boys) and adolescents (between puberty and
adulthood)(2), in many countries skip breakfast regularly(3,4).
Cross-sectional reports that show infrequent breakfast consump-
tion to be associated with overweight and obesity have led to
premature assumptions that breakfast can be used as an inter-
vention for weight loss(5). Indeed, the lower adiposity status in
children who frequently consume breakfast was not observed
uniformly across twelve countries(4). Thus, the strength, direction
and causal nature of associations between breakfast frequency
and adiposity are questionable.
The mechanistic basis for a causal link between breakfast
frequency and adiposity may be examined by assessing energy
intake (EI) and expenditure. Indeed, a sustained positive energy
balance where EI exceeds energy expenditure causes weight
gain(6). Despite their higher adiposity, young people who skip
breakfast have lower(7,8) or similar(9) daily EI when compared
with breakfast consumers. Interventions show that 1 d of break-
fast omission did not increase subsequent EI to compensate for
the energy deficit created by breakfast omission in children aged
8–10 years(10) and in adolescents aged 13–17 years(11). Increased
lunchtime EI has, however, been reported in men in response
to 1 d of breakfast omission(12). Under free-living conditions,
adults generally show higher daily EI when breakfast is
consumed(13,14,15), even when reductions in EI at lunch(15) or
between 12.00 and 18.00 hours(13) are observed. However, daily
EI was similar in obese adults assigned to daily breakfast omission
or consumption for 6 weeks(16). In overweight and obese
‘breakfast-skipping’ females aged 15–20 years, daily EI was
increased with normal-protein breakfast consumption, but a
high-protein breakfast reduced evening snacking and did not
increase daily EI(17). In a similar mixed-sex sample, 12 weeks of
high-protein breakfast consumption reduced free-living daily EI,

 consumption did not(18). However, these studies were based on
young people accustomed to breakfast omission and only
determined the impact of breakfast addition, not removal(17,18).
When determining free-living EI via self-report in adoles-
cents, compliance and underreporting are major challenges(19).
Adolescents report a preference for methods using technology,
such as a disposable camera(19), which eliminate the need for
participants to estimate portion size and are less burdensome
than weighed food diaries(20,21). Digital photography methods
have been validated against weighed food diaries and 24 h
recall in adults(21) and are reliable and valid when measuring
children’s
food
intake
in
cafeteria
settings(22).
However,
understanding the individual variation in free-living EI assessed
using digital photography requires investigation to determine
clinically meaningful intervention effects(23).
In addition to EI, physical activity (PA) is a key determinant of
energy balance, weight gain and health(6,24). Cross-sectional
studies using objective measures of PA (e.g. accelerometry)
have reported more frequent breakfast consumption to be
associated with higher PA in girls but not boys(25), or in boys but
not girls(26), or on weekends but not weekdays(27). In lean(14)
and obese(16) adults assigned to 6 weeks of daily breakfast
consumption or omission, higher PA energy expenditure in the
morning was shown in the breakfast consumption groups, and
this resulted in increased total daily PA energy expenditure in
the lean adults(14). In support, an acute within-participant cross-
over study showed increased morning PA energy expenditure
assessed via accelerometry when breakfast was consumed
compared with when it was omitted in women(15). However,
another study using pedometers and heart rate monitors
showed no effect(28). Furthermore, it is not known whether
consuming breakfast can increase PA in young people.
The adolescent period is a crucial time to promote dietary and
PA behaviours for health, particularly in girls(29). Furthermore,
breakfast skipping is highly prevalent in this population(30). Thus,
the current study used a randomised, cross-over design to
compare the effect of three consecutive weekdays of breakfast
omission with standardised breakfast (SB) consumption on
free-living EI and PA in girls aged 11–15 years. In a sub-sample,
we examined the natural variability in free-living daily EI assessed
using digital photography to determine the interindividual
intervention response.
Methods
Participants
In this dual centre project, forty-nine girls aged 11–15 years
were recruited from schools in the two locations in England.
The study was conducted according to the guidelines laid down
in the Declaration of Helsinki and all procedures involving
human subjects/patients were approved by the respective
University
Research
Ethics
Committees.
Written
informed
parental consent and child assent were obtained for all parti-
cipants. Girls were excluded from the study if they had health
related issues identified from a health screen questionnaire (e.g.
allergies to the breakfast meals, fitted with a pacemaker) or
were unable to walk or wear a PA monitor on their wrist.
Preliminary measurements
Stature was measured to the nearest 0·01m using a portable
Leicester height measure (SECA Corporation). Body mass was
measured and percent body fat estimated to the nearest 0·1 kg and
0·1% respectively using a Tanita Body Composition Analyser
(BC-418 MA; Tanita Corporation); subsequently, BMI was calcu-
lated as body mass divided by stature squared (kg/m2). Using age
and sex-specific BMI centiles(31), the girls were then classified as
non-overweight (2nd to 85th centile) or overweight (85th to 95th
centile). Waist circumference was measured to the nearest milli-
metre on exhalation at the midpoint between the last rib and top
of the iliac crest using a non-elastic tape measure(32). To describe
the pubertal status of the study sample, the girls were asked to
provide
a
validated(33,34)
self-assessment
of
their
physical
maturation using secondary sexual characteristics with the assis-
tance of a primary home-based carer(35). Habitual breakfast
frequency was assessed by asking participants the following
question: ‘How often do you usually have breakfast?’ Participants
were asked to indicate their response separately for weekdays and
for weekend days. Response categories were ‘never’ to ‘5d’ for the
week, and ‘never’ to ‘2d’ for the weekend. To provide an indi-
cation of the composition and energy content of the participants’
habitual breakfasts, they recorded their breakfast intakes across 3d
(Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, i.e. the weekdays selected
for the intervention described below) using digital photography
and a written food diary. Breakfast EI and macronutrient intakes
were calculated using Dietplan 6.7 (Forestfield Software).
Experimental design
Using a within-measures cross-over design, participants com-
pleted two, 3-d conditions in a counter-balanced order: no
breakfast (NB) and SB. The conditions were conducted across
the same three weekdays (i.e. Tuesday, Wednesday and
Thursday) with either a 4- or an 11-d washout between con-
ditions. For the duration of each 3-d condition, participants
were asked to record their diet and wear a wrist-worn
accelerometer. The order of the conditions for each partici-
pant was produced using a computer-based random number
generator by the principal investigator (J. K. Z.-F.). All data were
collected between December 2013 and July 2014.
On each morning of each 3-d condition, participants arrived
at school in the fasted state (no food or drink consumed except
water from 21.00 hours the previous day) and were asked not to
eat breakfast (NB) or to consume the SB provided within 30 min
(between 08.15 and 08.45 hours). For NB, participants were
provided with 375 ml of water. The participant’s first opportu-
nity to consume food or drink during the post-breakfast period
was 10.30 hours (i.e. during school break time); thus, NB
involved abstaining from energy-containing food and beverages
between 21.00 hours the previous day and 10.30 hours the
following morning. The participants were reminded on each
day of the experimental conditions to refrain from snacking
until 10.30 hours and reported that they complied with these
instructions.
The
SB
consisted
of
56·3 g
wheat
biscuits
(Weetabix), 188 ml semi-skimmed milk (Tesco Stores Ltd) and
375 ml orange juice (Tesco Stores Ltd). The breakfast was low
glycaemic index (GI), with a calculated GI of 54(36,37). We chose

 a ready-to-eat cereal because this type of breakfast is associated
with reduced obesity risk when compared with ‘other break-
fasts’(7). Recommendations suggest breakfast should be 20 % of
daily EI(38) and reviews define breakfast typically as containing
20–35 % of total daily energy needs(39). Therefore, the SB con-
tained 2092 kJ (500 kcal), equating to approximately 22–26 % of
daily energy requirements for 11–15-year-old girls, which take
into account total daily energy expenditure plus the deposited
energy costs for growth (8096–9594 kJ/d (1935–2293 kcal/d))(40).
The SB was consumed at school rather than home to monitor
compliance to the breakfast intervention and record any leftovers.
If the SB was not consumed completely, it had to represent at
least 20 % of recommended daily EI for the participant to be
included in the final sample(38).
Dietary assessment
Participants recorded their daily diet using a digital camera
(ViviCam 46; Vivitar) and food diary during each condition. A
similar method has been validated previously in adults(21) and
children(22). The participants were asked to photograph all foods
and beverages consumed and use the photographs as a recall
method when completing their food diaries each evening. The
food diaries included a record of the day, time, type, brand name,
preparation method, estimated portion size and any leftovers of all
food and drink consumed. Before completing the main condi-
tions, the girls received a tutorial and written instructions on using
the digital camera and food diary. On the morning after each day
of dietary recording, the research team checked the participants’
food diaries for completeness and cross-referenced the food dia-
ries with the corresponding photographs. For missing photo-
graphs, portion size was estimated by the participants using the
Young Person’s Food Atlas(41,42) with assistance from the research
team; further details were added to the diary when appropriate.
The mass of all foods and beverages consumed were estimated by
comparing the digital photographs, taken by the participants, with
the Young Person’s Food Atlas(41,42); this method has shown good
agreement

aged
≥11 years(43). Food diaries were analysed using Dietplan 6.7 to
estimate EI and macronutrient intakes, which were blocked into
three time periods to separate breakfast, lunch and the evening
meal and align with the school timetable: (i) 06.00–09.00 hours
(including breakfast and early morning snacks), (ii) 10.30–
14.00 hours (including school break time snacks and lunch) and
(iii) 14.00 until 21.00 hours (including dinner and evening snacks).
Percentage breakfast EI compensation was calculated for SB
relative to NB (i.e. the difference in post-breakfast EI between SB
and NB divided by SB breakfast EI multiplied by 100); values of
100% indicated complete compensation for breakfast EI. Portions
of fruit and vegetable consumed were quantified using the
National Health Service guidelines for 5 portions/d(44). High-fat
and sugary snacks were defined as sweet baked products,
cookies, ice cream, cakes, desserts, jams, sugar, sweets, nuts,
potato crisps, cheese products, popcorn and soft drinks(8).
Variability of daily energy intake
To determine the natural variability of daily EI, the primary
outcome variable, a sub-sample of ten girls completed two, 3-d
free-living diet (FD) conditions on 2 consecutive weeks at least
4 weeks before commencing the main study. On each day, the
girls were free to eat and drink as they pleased and were
instructed to record their dietary intakes using the digital
photography and food diary method described above (see the
‘Dietary assessment’ section ). Thus, the data provided an
indication of the variability in habitual dietary intakes between
two 3-d periods rather than being an assessment of measure-
ment reliability. The 95 % limits of agreement (LoA) for daily EI
were calculated by determining a 95 % limit above and below
the mean difference for FD trial 1 and FD trial 2 (systematic
error (1·96 × random error)), as outlined by Bland & Altman(45).
Student’s paired t tests were used to identify systematic change
in the mean from trial one to two; whereas Pearson’s product
moment correlations between the paired residuals and the
mean (proportional error check) and the absolute residuals and
the mean (heteroscedasticity check) were examined to ensure
the 95 % LoA were representative of the whole sample. It has
been estimated that excessive weight gain could be prevented
in children and adolescents by reducing positive energy bal-
ance by 628 kJ/d (150 kcal/d)(46). Therefore, we deemed that
LoA of ≤ ± 628 kJ/d (150 kcal/d) would be an acceptable test–
retest error for daily FD EI.
The data on variability of EI was also used as a control arm to
quantify the true interindividual differences in the EI response
to the breakfast intervention(23). To determine a ‘true’ effect,
Atkinson & Batterham(23) suggest comparing the SD of changes
in the intervention arm (i.e., the effect SD) with the SD of changes
from the control arm (i.e. the control SD). The SD of the true
individual response is:

ðSD 2
e �SD 2
c Þ
p
, where SDe is the effect SD
and SDc is the control SD(23). The magnitude of the SD of true
individual responses is appraised in terms of clinical impor-
tance. As with our LoA analysis, we deemed that a difference of
≥ ± 628 kJ/d (150 kcal/d) would be clinically important when
comparing the control and intervention SD(46).
Physical activity assessment
Wrist-worn accelerometers that have been validated in 8–14
year olds (GENEActiv; Activinsights Ltd) were used to assess PA
for the duration of each 3-d condition(47). The accelerometers
were set to record at 85·7 Hz using a 1-s epoch. The girls were
asked to wear the accelerometers on their non-dominant wrist
for 3 d at all times, removing only for bathing and water-based
activities. To estimate daily time spent sedentary and in light PA
(LPA) and moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA), GENEActiv cut-
points specific to 8–14 year olds were applied and expressed as
percentage of total daily wear time(47). The minimal amount of
accelerometer data that were considered acceptable was 10 h/d
of wear time on all 3 d of both breakfast conditions(48).
Statistical analyses
Statistical analyses were completed using IBM SPSS statistics
software for Windows version 21 (IBM Corporation). Total daily
EI, macronutient intakes and PA were compared between the
two conditions using student’s paired t tests. For post-breakfast
EI and macronutrient intakes, condition × time of day (2 × 2)
repeated-measures ANOVA were used to examine differences

 between the conditions across the two time periods (i.e. 10.30–
14.00 and 14.00–21.00 hours). Weekday habitual breakfast
frequency and BMI were considered as covariates, but were not
used because the data did not satisfy the assumptions for cov-
ariate analysis (i.e. they were not significantly associated with
the dependent variables across all conditions). Homogeneity of
covariances were examined by Mauchly’s test of sphericity, and
a Greenhouse–Geisser correction was applied to the df if the
sphericity assumption was violated. Cohen’s d effect sizes (d)
were calculated to gauge the magnitude of differences between
conditions for all significant effects. In the absence of published
anchors, a d ≥ 0·20 was considered the minimum important
difference in all outcome measures, 0·50 to <0·80 moderate and
≥0·80 large(49). Values are presented as means and standard
deviations unless stated otherwise.
Justification of sample size
The calculated sample size was based on total daily EI (the
primary outcome variable) and LPA (% wear time), as this PA
intensity has been shown to be sensitive to breakfast mani-
pulation in adults(14). A worthwhile difference in EI or energy
expenditure between the two conditions was defined as
628 kJ/d (150 kcal/d)(46). Our variability study showed that the
SD of the EI difference between two, 3-d FD conditions was
1147 kJ/d (274 kcal/d). A 628 kJ/d increase in energy expendi-
ture requires approximately 45 min of LPA at 14·0 kJ/min in
adolescent girls(47,50). This would equate to 5 % of weekday
waking hours and an SD of 6 %(48,51). Using these figures, the
number of participants estimated to detect a significant change
at 90 % power with a two-sided significance level of 0·05 was
35 for daily EI and 30 for LPA. To be included in the final
sample,
participants
had
to
meet
the
following
criteria:
(1) attended the breakfast intervention club on all days;
(2) abstain from all foods and beverages until 10.30 hours for
NB; (3) consume at least 20 % of recommended daily EI if they
did not consume the SB completely(38); (4) record their diet and
wear the accelerometer as specified. Thus, forty-nine partici-
pants were recruited to allow for a dropout of 10–30 %.
Results
Participant characteristics
The final sample for dietary analysis included forty participants
(nine were excluded: three broke the fast before 10.30 hours
during NB, one did not consume an adequate amount of the SB
and five did not record their dietary intakes as specified). Three
participants that were included in the final sample did not eat all
of the SB, but consumed enough so that SB EI was at least 20 %
of recommended daily EI(38). Table 1 shows the anthropometric
characteristics and habitual breakfast frequencies of the final
sample. The nine girls who were excluded from the final
analyses did not have significantly different physical char-
acteristics or breakfast frequencies compared with the 40 who
were included (P ≥ 0·10).
Variability of daily energy intake
At the group level (n 10), EI was similar between FD trial 1 and
FD trial 2 (5063 (SD 1332) v. 5244 (SD 1293) kJ/d (1211 (SD 319) v.
1255 (SD 309) kcal/d); t = − 0·500; P = 0·629). The systematic
bias was 181 (random error 1147) kJ/d (43 (random error
274) kcal/d). This resulted in 95 % LoA of −2067 to 2428 kJ/d,
(−494 to 580 kcal/d) (see online Supplementary Document S1).
Significant proportional bias was not evident (r −0·038;
P = 0·917) and random errors were homoscedastic (r −0·040;
P = 0·912). The LoA based on all ten girls exceeded our a priori
acceptable test–retest variability of ±628 kJ/d (150 kcal/d).
However, seven of the ten participants had paired EI values
across the repeat measurements that were within ±628 kJ/d
(150 kcal/d), suggesting the natural variation in FD may be
small enough to detect subtle changes in EI that could prevent
excessive weight gain(46). In the remaining three girls, one had a
particularly large difference of 3141 kJ/d between the repeat
measurements. When excluding this participant (n 9), the
systematic error was reduced by −148 (random error 512) kJ/d,
and the 95 % LoA were tightened to −1151 to 855 kJ/d, but still
exceed the ±628 kJ/d cut-off.
Breakfast energy and macronutrient intake
Accounting for leftovers, breakfast energy and macronutrient
intakes for SB were: EI 1962 (SD 121) kJ (469 (SD 29) kcal), 88·3
(SD 6·0) g carbohydrate (CHO), 16·4 (SD 1·3) g protein, 5·7 (SD
0·7) g fat and 5·8 (SD 0·6) g fibre. For comparison, the girls
consumed 766 (SD 439) kJ (183 (SD 105) kcal), 29·4 (SD 16·1) g
CHO, 5·4 (SD 3·7) g protein, 5·4 (SD 4·5) g fat and 1·2 (SD 1·0) g
fibre for breakfast habitually. The energy, CHO, protein and
fibre intake of the SB were higher than the girls habitual
breakfasts (P < 0·005; d = 3·69–5·32), whereas fat intakes were
similar (P = 0·672; d = 0·09).
Daily and post-breakfast energy intake
Fig. 1 shows daily and time-specific EI for each breakfast con-
dition. Daily EI was higher in SB than NB (P < 0·0005). For daily
EI, we quantified the true interindividual differences in the
intervention responses using the control SD from the variability
data described above and the SD of the residuals from the
breakfast conditions(23). The SD of the true individual response

 was 636 (95 % CI 229, 1042) kJ/d (152 (55, 249) kcal/d) for SB v.
NB. Using our cut-off of ≥628 kJ/d (150 kcal/d), the large
differences in the control and intervention SD may be clinically
important.
Post-breakfast
(i.e.
10.30–21.00
hours)
EI
was
483
(SD 1309)kJ/d higher in NB compared with SB (P=0·025; d=0·37),
independent of the time of day (P=0·993) (Fig. 1). The higher post-
breakfast EI in NB accounted for 24 (SD 66)% of the SB EI.
Daily and post-breakfast macronutrient intakes
Table 2 shows daily macronutrient intakes for each breakfast
condition. Daily CHO, fibre and protein intakes were higher in
SB compared with NB (d ≥ 0·81 for all comparisons), whereas
daily fat intake was not. The effect of condition was NS for
CHO, fat, protein and fibre intakes for the post-breakfast period
(P ≥ 0·451; d ≤ 0·14 for all comparisons) and there was no
interaction with time of day (P ≥ 0·329). The time of day main
effect showed that protein and fibre intakes were higher in the
14.00–21.00 hours period than the 10.30–14.00 hours period
(P ≤ 0·026; d ≥ 0·50), but this difference only approached
significance for CHO with a small effect (P = 0·054; d = 0·40).
Daily fruit and vegetable and high-fat and sugary snack
consumption
The breakfast condition main effect for daily portions of fruit
and vegetables consumed was not significant (1·1 (SD 1·1) for
NB v. 1·1 (SD 0·8) for SB; P = 0·801). Although the mean number
of high-fat and sugary snacks consumed per day tended to be
higher for NB (3·0 (SD 1·5)) compared with SB (2·6 (SD 1·3))
(P = 0·097), the effect was only small (d = 0·26).
Daily physical activity
A total of thirty-five girls had valid accelerometer data and were
included in PA analyses. Wear time was 14·2 (SD 1·2) h/d for SB
and 14·1 (SD 1·3) h/d for NB (P = 0·488). Daily time spent
sedentary or in LPA or MVPA (% wear time) was not different
between conditions (Table 3).
Discussion
Using an experimental cross-over design, this study showed
that total daily EI was higher when adolescent girls consumed
an approximately 1962 kJ SB when compared with NB over
3 consecutive weekdays. Although NB increased post-breakfast
EI, the degree of EI compensation was small and only
accounted for approximately 24 % of the SB. In addition,
breakfast manipulation did not affect time spent sedentary
or in PA.
Our study supports previous research showing that breakfast
consumption results in higher daily EI in young people(10,17)
and adults(12,13,14,15,52) when compared with breakfast omis-
sion. In addition to being statistically significant, random within-
subject variation and measurement error did not explain the
higher daily EI with breakfast consumption, which exceeded
the natural variability in EI by more than 628 kJ/d (150 kcal/d)
and may thus have clinical importance for weight gain(23,46).
The 483 kJ/d (115 kcal/d) increase in post-breakfast EI (i.e.
between 10.30 and 21.00 hours) when the girls omitted
breakfast amounted to only a quarter of the SB. This incomplete
EI compensation may be due to the large size of the SB, which
contained 2·6 times more energy than the participants’ habitual
breakfasts. As CHO-based breakfasts containing approximately

 1·3 times less energy than our SB also did not result in EI
compensation in young people(10,17), examining the effects of
smaller breakfasts similar in energy content to the habitual
breakfasts of adolescent girls (approximately 766 kJ in our
sample) may enhance the ecological validity of the findings and
likelihood EI compensation being complete. Although the
increased EI with breakfast omission was distributed evenly
across the day in our study, reports in adults indicate that these
effects are specific to certain time periods(12,13,15). It has also been
shown that such effects may depend on the sex and breakfast
habits of the sample(28), whereas habitual breakfast frequency
was not related to the outcome variables in our sample of ado-
lescent girls. Nevertheless, the 95 % CI for the SD of the individual
response (229–1042 kJ/d) indicates large interindividual variability
in compensatory EI responses to breakfast omission. Thus, indi-
vidual characteristics that may explain this variability, such as
eating and PA habits, body composition, age and socioeconomic
status warrant clarification.
Unlike most previous experimental studies in adults that
involved unstandardised breakfast manipulation(13,14,16,28), we
provided a standardised, wholegrain ready-to-eat cereal-based
breakfast. This type of breakfast was chosen because it has
strong association with lowered obesity risk in adolescents(7)
and it is a convenient breakfast choice that requires minimal
preparation time, which could be appealing for adolescents
who skip breakfast due to a ‘lack of time’(53). The small, but
statistically significant increase in post-breakfast EI (i.e. between
10.30 and 21.00 hours) with breakfast omission reported here is
in contrast with research in ‘breakfast-skipping’ adolescents
showing that normal-protein breakfasts do not reduce sub-
sequent EI(11,17,18). Although breakfast GI was not reported in
these studies(11,17,18), it is possible that the low GI breakfast in
our study promoted a slower release of glucose into the blood,
which can reduce hunger and lunchtime EI(54) and prolong
satiety(55) in young people and may explain our discrepant
findings(11,17,18). However, the link between GI and EI is con-
troversial(56,57), with the satiating effect of low GI foods possibly
being due to their higher fibre content(56). Nevertheless, the
5·8 g of fibre in our SB was within the range of the breakfasts in
previous studies (2·0–6·1 g)(11,17). Thus, differences in fibre
content of the CHO-based breakfasts may not explain dis-
crepancies between our results and previous work. Increased EI
in response to breakfast omission may be due to a host of
metabolic and behavioural responses induced by the appetite
regulatory system, including increased pre-dinnertime neural
activation in brain regions controlling food motivation/reward
in late adolescent girls(17). Such mechanisms require further
research in young people.
Although weighed food records are often considered the
criterion reference measure of free-living EI in adults, self-
reported EI can be underestimated through poor compliance,
participant selection bias, recording bias and changes to diet to
facilitate recording(58). In adolescents, the reliability and validity
of weighed food diaries is less certain and the participant
burden is particularly high(59,60). In an attempt to increase
compliance to recording dietary intakes in our study, we used a
food diary accompanied by photographic evidence rather than
a weighed food diary(19). Although previous research has
indicated that the addition of photographs to a traditional diet
diary can enhance the validity and reliability of dietary
recording(61), our comparison of two 3-d records showed 95 %
LoA for EI of −2067 to +2428 kJ/d (−494 to +580 kcal/d). This
high variability of free-living EI, potentially resulting from
environmental, biological and methodological factors(62), may
limit the potential to detect clinically meaningful differences of
628 kJ/d (150 kcal/d)(46). Previous literature on free-living EI
variability using 3 d diet records has used varied statistical
approaches and produced mixed findings(63,64). Interestingly,
our LoA are narrower than studies reporting ‘acceptable’
agreement with a 3-d diet record in adults(65) and a food menu
in free-living young people(66). Thus, the use of a clinically
relevant anchor may have affected the interpretation of the LoA
in these studies.
Consistent with cross-sectional reports(8,9,30), the higher daily
EI with SB consumption was due to higher intakes of CHO,
protein and fibre, whereas breakfast did not affect daily fat
intakes. These differences in daily macronutrient intakes were a
direct effect of the breakfast meal rather than post-breakfast
intakes. Nevertheless, it is likely that the tendency for higher
high-fat and sugary snack consumption contributed to the
increased post-breakfast EI when breakfast was omitted. This
finding also suggests that the nature of the cross-sectional
association between infrequent breakfast consumption and
higher unhealthy snack consumption(8,9) may be causal.
Overall, the girls consumed about one portion of fruit and
vegetables a day, a concerning number considering that a
minimum
of
five
portions
per
day
is
recommended(44).
Although breakfast consumption has been associated with
higher fruit and vegetable consumption(67,68), the present study
suggests that any such relations are not causal, at least in our
sample over a 3-d intervention. As food groups other than fruit
and vegetables contribute to micronutrient intakes, whether
breakfast manipulation affects micronutrient intakes warrants
examination using assessment periods of more than 3 d(69).
The small post-breakfast EI compensation in the present
study suggests that a higher PA energy expenditure may be
more important in contributing to the healthy weight status in
frequent breakfast consumers(1,3,4,5,7). However, our finding
that breakfast did not affect sedentary time or MVPA supports
cross-sectional findings in girls aged 9–10 years when using
accelerometry to quantify PA on weekdays and weekends(26)
and experimental research in adults showing no effect of
breakfast manipulation on PA assessed via pedometers and
heart rate monitors during a working week(28). Although
breakfast manipulation did not affect LPA in the girls in the
present study, energy expenditure from LPA assessed over 7 d
was higher in lean adults who consumed breakfast daily com-
pared with those who omitted breakfast daily(14). In the obese
cohort of this 6 weeks intervention, total PA energy expenditure
in the morning was higher in the breakfast group compared
with the breakfast omission group(16). An acute randomised
cross-over trial using accelerometry also showed that consum-
ing breakfast increased PA energy expenditure when compared
with breakfast omission in women classified as habitual
breakfast eaters(15). The adolescent girls in our study may have
responded differently to the adults in previous studies(14,15,16)

 because the provision of breakfast at school meant that they
had limited opportunity to engage in free-living PA directly after
consuming breakfast. Thus, providing breakfast at home and
including weekend days may increase the scope for detecting
effects on PA.
The present study has several limitations. First, breakfast
manipulation over 3 weekdays does not allow us to apply
the findings to weekends, where diet and PA patterns are
different(27,51,70), or to determine the effects of longer intervention
periods. Second, similar to previous studies(17,18), we provided a
fixed absolute breakfast portion. However, providing breakfast
relative to daily energy requirements may be recommended to
reduce between–participant variability in the response to break-
fast manipulation. Similarly, methods that provide less variable
measures EI would help support our findings, although this is
challenging in free-living conditions(58,59,60). In addition, standar-
dising pre-intervention diet and the duration of the washout
period between participants would help to minimise the influ-
ence of these factors on the study outcomes. Third, future studies
employing more sensitive measures to quantify free-living PA or
energy expenditure (e.g. combined heart rate-accelerometry or
doubly
labelled
water)
over
longer
measurement
periods
(e.g. 7 d) would be valuable in extending the findings reported
here. In doing so, the possibility that breakfast consumption may
affect PA through an interaction with wake time and sleeping
patterns requires consideration. Differences in wake time are
unlikely to have confounded the comparison between SB and NB
in our study, as the provision of breakfast at school rather than at
home meant that the participants were not required to wake up
any earlier to consume the SB. Nevertheless, the independent
effects of breakfast frequency, timing and composition warrant
study. Finally, the generalisability of our findings to adolescent
boys and to younger children requires investigation.
In conclusion, adolescent girls showed a small increase in
post-breakfast EI of 483 kJ/d (115 kcal/d) that was not sufficient
to compensate completely for 3 consecutive weekdays of
breakfast omission when compared with SB consumption
(approximately 1962 kJ/d). Thus, total daily EI remained greater
when a SB was consumed. We also report no evidence of
breakfast affecting time spent sedentary or in PA. These findings
require examination using extended periods of breakfast
manipulation and more sensitive devices to quantify PA energy
expenditure in young people.
