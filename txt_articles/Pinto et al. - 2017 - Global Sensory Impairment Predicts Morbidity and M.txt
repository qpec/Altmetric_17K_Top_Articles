OBJECTIVES: To
evaluate
global
sensory
impairment
(GSI, an integrated measure of sensory dysfunction) as a
predictor of physical function, cognition, overall health,
and mortality.
DESIGN: Prospective study.
SETTING: The National Social Life, Health, and Aging
Project.
PARTICIPANTS: A national probability sample of 3,005
home-dwelling
older
U.S.
adults
assessed
at
baseline
(2005–06) and 5-year follow-up (2010–11).
MEASUREMENTS: Gait speed, activity, disability, cogni-
tion, overall health, 5-year mortality.
RESULTS: At baseline, older adults with worse GSI were
slower (Timed Up and Go times: odds ratio (OR) = 1.32,
95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.17–1.50) and had more
activity of daily living deficits (≥2: OR = 1.26, 95%
CI = 1.10–1.46). Five years later, they were still slower
(timed walk: OR = 1.22, 95% CI = 1.05–1.42), had more
disabilities
(≥2
instrumental
activities
of
daily
living;
OR = 1.45, 95% CI = 1.23–1.70), were less active (day-
time activity according to accelerometry: b = �2.7, 95%
CI = �5.2 to �0.2), had worse cognitive function (Mon-
treal Cognitive Assessment; b = �0.64, 95% CI = �0.84
to �0.44), more likely to have poorer overall health
(OR = 1.16,
95%
CI = 1.03–1.31)
and
lose
weight
(>10%: OR = 1.31, 95% CI = 1.04–1.64), and have died
(OR = 1.45,
95%
CI = 1.19–1.76).
All
analyses
were
adjusted for relevant confounders at baseline, including
age, sex, race and ethnicity, education, smoking, problem
drinking, body mass index, comorbidities, and cognitive
function.
CONCLUSION: GSI predicts impaired physical function,
cognitive dysfunction, significant weight loss, and mortal-
ity

ensory loss commonly affects how older adults live and
interact with their environments and other people and
plays a critical role in disease, often with profound conse-
quences. Sensory loss is associated with an array of detri-
mental clinical and functional outcomes, depending on the
sense involved.1–12 Evidence supporting such relationships
has focused primarily on single-sensory modalities or dual
impairments (typically vision and hearing), and dual deficits
have ben found to have synergistic detrimental effects.12–14
Multisensory loss appears to be common in older U.S.
adults15,16 but has been little studied. There are specific
neurophysiological changes associated with aging that
could increase dysfunction in all senses.17–26 To the knowl-
edge of the authors of the current study, concurrent sen-
sory deficits in all classical senses (vision, hearing, taste,
smell, touch) have not been reported.
To address this gap, the concept of global sensory
impairment (GSI), which captures common mechanisms
underlying decline of the classical senses, was proposed and
tested.16 This model showed that a common underlying
factor explained a significant amount of variation in each
of the sensory dysfunctions, supporting the concept of a
unified underlying process of sensory aging. Such a frame-
work is conceptually similar to the common cause hypothe-
sis in aging, wherein a common factor is responsible for
age-related deterioration in cognitive and noncognitive

 processes.6,27 In contrast, GSI is limited in focus to the
senses by definition, which is different from studies model-
ing aging across a wide array of physiological systems.28
Nevertheless, multiple sensory deficits, similar to multiple
physical impairments,29 constitute an important facet of
the aging process that may provide complementary infor-
mation. This idea remains to be tested rigorously.
The current prospective study was designed to deter-
mine whether and how GSI predicts important health out-
comes in the National Social Life, Health, and Aging
Project (NSHAP).30
METHODS
Respondents and Study Design
In
2005–06,
interviewers
conducted
baseline
in-home
interviews with 3,005 home-dwelling older adults identi-
fied using a national probability sample of the population
of home-dwelling adults aged 57–85.30 Sensory function of
all five classical senses was assessed.31,32 Five years later
(2010–11), respondents who remained alive were inter-
viewed again.33 Information collected at baseline included
measures of mobility, disability, demographic characteris-
tics, health behaviors, body mass index (BMI), comorbid
diseases, and cognitive function.34,35 Five years later, sev-
eral measures were improved (notably cognition and activ-
ity, as detailed below); because of other changes in the
study, some measures could not be included (notably mea-
surement of all five senses) (Data S1).
Function of Five Classical Senses in the Home
Methods for measuring the five classical senses at base-
line16,32 have been described (Data S2).
GSI Score
The GSI score measures the underlying processes common
to dysfunction of all five classic senses and is derived from a
generalized single-factor measurement model that was fit to
the five observed sensory dysfunction measures16 (Data S2).
Baseline Measures of Physical Function
Mobility was measured at baseline in a random subset of
participants (Table 1) using the Timed Up and Go Test
(TUG).36 TUG times were categorized as normal (≤10 sec-
onds), delayed (11–20 seconds), or impaired (>20 seconds
or wheelchair bound).
Disability
was
measured
according
to
respondent
report of difficulty performing seven activities of daily liv-
ing (ADLs) (Table 1).37 The ADL disability variable was
collapsed into two categories: difficulty with two or more
ADLs versus difficulty with fewer than two ADLs.
Baseline Covariates
Demographic traits
Race and Hispanic ethnicity were classified using standard
National
Institutes
of
Health
terms.
Education
was
categorized according to the highest degree or certification
earned.
Health
behaviors
(problem
drinking,
current
tobacco use) were assessed as previously described.38 Body
mass index (BMI) was calculated from measured height
and weight and categorized using standard thresholds.
Health was measured using a Charlson Comorbidity Index
modified for survey use (Modified Comorbidity Index,
range 0–24).39 Diabetes mellitus and hypertension were
included separately because of specific interest in the effect
of these diseases. Cognitive function was assessed using a
version of the Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire
(SPMSQ) modified for survey use (range 0–10).40
Five-Year Outcome Measures
Impaired Mobility
At 5-year follow-up, mobility was measured in all return-
ing participants using a 3-m timed walk (TW) (Table 1).
The fastest performance on two attempts was categorized
for
increasing
impairment
as
excellent
(≤3.1 seconds),
good
(3.2–4 seconds),
fair
(4.1–5.6 seconds),
or
poor
(≥5.7 seconds or unable to complete the task).37 Adjusting
for height and weight separately, instead of BMI, did not
change the reported findings.
Disability
At 5-year follow-up, all returning respondents (Table 1)
reported degree of difficulty completing eight instrumental
activities of daily living (IADLs).37 The IADL disability vari-
able was collapsed into two categories: difficulty with two
or more IADLs versus difficulty with fewer than two IADLs.
Physical Activity
Mean daytime activity count was calculated during the
awake interval using standard criteria using data from a
wrist-worn
accelerometer
(Actiwatch
Spectrum,
Philips
Respironics, Eindhoven, the Netherlands) in an accelerom-
etry substudy (Table 1).37 Higher values indicate greater
activity.
Cognition
Cognition was measured (Table 1) using the Montreal Cog-
nitive
Assessment
adapted
for
survey
administration
(MoCA-SA, previously termed the Chicago Cognitive Func-
tion Measure).41,42 Higher values indicate better function.
Health
Respondents rated their overall physical and mental health
on a 5-point scale from excellent to poor (Table 1).
Weight loss of at least 10% between baseline and follow-
up was calculated directly. The effect of cancer on weight
loss was directly controlled for by removing cancer diag-
nosis from the baseline modified comorbidity index and
adding it independently to the prospective analyses of
weight loss.
Mortality
Vitality was confirmed using validated methods43 (Data
S3).

 Statistical Analysis
Different types of analyses were used to test the associa-
tions between GSI and other variables based on their mea-
surement type: ordinal or standard logistic regressions for
ordinal (TUG, TW, self-reported physical and mental
health) and binary (≥2 ADLs or IADLs, >10% weight loss,
mortality) data and linear regression for continuous data
(mean daytime activity count and MoCA-SA score). Effect
sizes reported for these relationships (odds ratios (ORs),
linear regression coefficients) are presented in terms of a
1–standard deviation (SD) increase in GSI. Baseline covari-
ates common to all models included age, sex, race, educa-
tion,
smoking,
problem
drinking,
BMI,
modified
comorbidity index, diabetes mellitus, hypertension and
cognition. For analyses examining 5-year outcomes at fol-
low-up, to assess the predictive power of GSI in addition
to the baseline condition of the variable being analyzed,
the baseline measures of the predicted variable were also
included.

SENSORY FUNCTION AND HEALTH OUTCOMES
2589
 Analyses were weighted to account for differing prob-
abilities of nonresponse and selection33,44 and therefore
describe the population of older U.S. adults living in their
homes. Design-based standard errors were calculated using
the linearization method together with the strata and pri-
mary sampling unit indicators provided with the data set.
Analyses were performed using Stata version 14 (Stata-
Corp LP, College Station, TX).
RESULTS
Associations with Physical Function at Baseline
Mobility
Greater GSI was associated with markedly worse mobility
on the TUG (OR = 1.32 per 1-SD increase in GSI, 95%
CI = 1.17–1.50, P < .001; Table 2), adjusting for age, sex,
race, education, tobacco use, problem drinking, BMI,
comorbidity, and cognitive function. As expected, older
respondents, women, and those with greater comorbidity
(specifically diabetes mellitus) had slower TUG times.
Disability
Individuals with greater GSI were more likely to have two
or more difficulties with ADLs, adjusting for the same
covariates as above (OR = 1.26, 95% CI = 1.10–1.46,
P = .002; Table 2). Women, older respondents, smokers,
and those with greater comorbidity all had greater disabil-
ity.
Mobility and disability were therefore added as base-
line covariates in the prospective analysis of GSI as predic-
tors of daytime physical activity 5 years later.
5-Year Outcomes
Impaired Mobility
Greater GSI at baseline was associated with slower walk-
ing 5 years later (TW: OR = 1.22, 95% CI = 1.05–1.42,
P = .01; Figure 1, Table S1) after adjusting for all the
baseline covariates and baseline TUG performance, indi-
cating the predictive power of GSI even when adjusting for
baseline impaired mobility. Participants who were older,
women, minorities, and those with less education walked
significantly more slowly than those who had obesity,
hypertension, and more comorbidities at baseline.
Disability
Participants with greater GSI at baseline had greater odds
of having difficulty with 2 or more IADLs 5 years later
(OR = 1.45,

CI = 1.23–1.70,

 and those with less education had significantly more dis-
abilities than those who were smokers and had more
comorbidities and poorer cognitive status at baseline.
Physical Activity
Participants with greater GSI at baseline had less daytime
activity
(accelerometry)
5 years
later
(b = �2.7,
95%
CI = �5.2 to �0.2, P = .03; Table 3), similarly adjusted
for baseline covariates, including baseline impaired mobil-
ity and disabilities. Less-active respondents were also more
likely to be older and male, although men walked more
quickly and had fewer disabilities, as is common at older
ages. Participants who were less active were more likely to
have been smokers at baseline and to have an abnormal
BMI (underweight, overweight, or obese), hypertension or
diabetes mellitus, and better baseline cognition.
Cognitive Function
Worse GSI at baseline also predicted poorer cognition
5 years later (b = �0.64, 95% CI = �0.84 to �0.44,
P < .001; Table 3), adjusted for the same baseline demo-
graphic and health covariates, including baseline cognition,
indicating the predictive power of GSI over baseline cogni-
tive abilities. Those with worse cognition at follow-up
were more likely to be male, minorities, less educated,
underweight, and hypertensive.
Overall Health Outcomes
High baseline GSI was also associated with worse self-
reported

independent of baseline physical and mental health and
the standard baseline covariates. Participants who reported
poor physical and mental health at follow-up included par-
ticipants were less educated, smoked, and were under- or
overweight at baseline. Those who had more baseline
comorbidities, particularly diabetes mellitus and hyperten-
sion,
subsequently
reported
poorer
physical
health,
whereas
those
with
poor
baseline
cognition
reported
poorer mental health.
Worse GSI was also associated with greater odds of a
10% or more decline in weight 5 years later, adjusted for
baseline covariates and interim development of cancer
(OR = 1.31,
95%
CI = 1.04–1.64,
P = .02;
Figure 1,
Table S3). Older respondents, women, African Americans,
smokers, problem drinkers, and those who were overweight
or obese or did not have hypertension were also more likely
to lose a significant amount of weight (>10% from baseline).
GSI and 5-Year Mortality
Greater GSI was associated with greater odds of death
(OR = 1.45, 95% CI = 1.19–1.76, P < .001; Table S3) in
a model that adjusted for all baseline covariates, as well as
baseline impaired mobility, an important component of
frailty. Older and less-educated respondents had greater
odds of death, as did those who were smokers or under-
weight and had greater comorbidity (particularly diabetes
mellitus)
and
worse
cognition

baseline
(Figure 1,

Figure 1. Global sensory impairment predicts worse mobility and function, weight loss, and greater mortality 5 years later (mean
probability, adjusting for baseline covariates; see Tables S1 and S3 for full models). The probability of taking more than 4 sec-
onds on the timed walk increases from 0.48 for those with the lowest GSI score to 0.68 for those with the highest. The probabil-
ity of having two or more instrumental activity of daily living difficulties increases from 0.16 for those with the lowest GSI score
to 0.47 for those with the highest, and the probability of having more than 10% weight loss increases from 0.08 to 0.25. The
probability of 5-year mortality increases from 0.07 for those with the lowest GSI score to 0.27 for those with the highest. The

 association between the individual sensory dysfunctions
and mortality.
Sensitivity Analysis
To test whether these results were robust, a sensitivity
analysis was performed that included only respondents
with complete data for sensory function (n = 1,301). These
results were nearly identical, supporting the conclusions
(data not shown).
DISCUSSION
This study shows for the first time that deficits in sensory
function in all five senses (GSI) at baseline independently
predict major health outcomes assessed 5 years later, includ-
ing death, strongly supporting the concept that sensory
impairment is a critical part of aging. These results suggest
that the relationship between sensory dysfunction and poor
health is profound. This concept of a common underlying
process shared across all five senses contrasts with prior
work examining the effect of specific sensory deficits inde-
pendently (or in subsets of two or three).6,15 Instead, GSI
measures the intrinsic mechanisms common to deterioration
of all the senses, for example, neurophysiological changes
associated with aging (e.g., loss of lateral inhibition,
decreased specialization of neural pathways and greater con-
nectivity, decrease in white matter density and thinning of
the cortex)45 that are the result of a variety of mechanisms.
Thus, decline of the sensory systems would serve as an early
harbinger that reflects general neurophysiological decline.
Alternatively, it is possible that decreased sensory
input due to peripheral decline causes or accelerates the
loss of neuronal connections in the brain, potentially
increasing cognitive load46,47 and hastening development
of neurodegeneration. These two mechanisms (common
cause etiology and sequelae of information degradation)
are not mutually exclusive.37,48 Identifying mechanisms
underlying these findings will be important in future work.
Prior work examining the cumulative effects of deficits
in one to three senses demonstrated that more deficits inter-
fere to a greater degree with daily living, quality of life, and
health outcomes,49–51 probably primarily mediated through
behaviors. In contrast, the approach of the current study
introduces the concept of an intrinsic mechanism common
to all senses that also affects other physiological systems
and leads to accelerated aging and death. For example, pre-
vious work pinpointed olfaction as an important predictor
of health and mortality in older adults when considered
independently,15 in contrast to vision and hearing. The

 current study shows that all five classical senses share the
component of olfaction underlying this relationship.
GSI predicts many of the components of physical
frailty included in three of the major, standard models
(e.g., slow gait, weight loss, low activity).52–54 This funda-
mental question of the precise relationship between sen-
sory impairment and physical frailty remains unanswered
here, a limitation, calling for additional study to determine
whether GSI is an independent phenomenon or shares
underlying mechanisms with other physiological processes.
Regardless, GSI complements the concept of physical
frailty and is an important component of aging.
Future work would benefit from the inclusion of addi-
tional clinical measures of sensory function (e.g., near and
distance vision, audiometry). The focus of NSHAP was on
life at home, in contrast to clinic- or hospital-based assess-
ments, which were not possible. Nevertheless, it is likely
that the burden of sensory impairments was underesti-
mated; better precision in the measures would probably
make the results more robust. For example, it is likely that
the social measure of hearing (measuring conversational
ability) overestimates performance relative to standard
audiometric measures. Thus, it is likely that these results
are conservative. There may be similar imprecision in
other sensory measures, but it is unlikely that these would
substantially alter the main results.16
Another limitation is that some measures were not
identical at follow-up. Nonetheless, all measures were vali-
dated tools and capture useful information, and it is unli-
kely that they would have significantly altered the main
results. This decision to change some measures precluded
incidence or change analyses here (weight loss excepted)
and limited the focus to the association between GSI at
baseline (adjusting for baseline covariates) and health out-
comes at 5-year follow-up. The baseline condition of the
health outcomes could have been included in the models,
and the predictive power of GSI after accounting for base-
line status of each particular health outcome could thereby
have been demonstrated.
Although it is possible that unmeasured confounders
may be responsible in part for the associations observed,
the temporal ordering in the analysis excluded the possibil-
ity of simultaneity (that the outcomes at follow-up were
causing the sensory impairment at baseline). In addition,
temporal ordering adds to the clinical relevance of the
results, which provide an additional piece of information
that a physician may use to identify individuals at higher
risk of subsequent poor outcomes. Future studies will be
able to use longitudinal data to focus more specifically on
the underlying causal processes.
Another limitation is that the SPMSQ (a screening
instrument) does not adjust completely for differences in
cognitive function at baseline; future follow-up with the
same detailed cognitive measures are needed. These results
may be viewed as being relevant for individuals without
gross cognitive impairment at baseline; models that do not
include adjustment for baseline cognition yield essentially
the same results (results are conservative). It was decided
to include the SPMSQ to more closely match the objective
of the analysis, which was to examine the value of sensory
impairment for predicting subsequent outcomes condi-
tional
on
an
individual’s
observed
characteristics
at
baseline, as a translational concept relevant for clinicians.
Future studies may be needed to test these issues and those
arising for other baseline covariates vigorously. Although
connecting sensory impairment and cognitive impairment
may not be new, these results are novel in several ways.
We extend this concept to the general population of older
U.S. adults to other important health outcomes (e.g., mor-
tality) and consider all five sensory modalities.
Clinical Implications
The presence of multiple sensory deficits can be a clinical
biomarker identifying older adults at high risk of poor
health outcomes. Such individuals should be placed under
close
surveillance
and
undergo
additional
evaluation.
Although incidence or change analyses per se were not per-
formed, the results are consistent with the idea that GSI
presages a range of severe health problems that might be
delayed or even prevented with intervention. Such a focus
would allow clinicians to directly address the identified
burdens of these deficits, some of which are correctable
(e.g., eyeglasses, surgery for cataracts or refraction, hearing
aids or cochlear implants, olfactory training) and may be
synergistic55 and should be considered for implementation.
Because insurance does not cover many sensory interven-
tions (e.g., glasses or hearing aids by Medicare), these find-
ings justify health policy changes. Finally, prospective
studies of interventions are warranted to understand how
sensory function affects and is related to aging, neurode-
generation, and mortality.
Further examination of sensory function of all five
senses will provide vital answers to these and other major
questions and allow preventive measures to be designed or
therapeutic targets identified to mitigate or prevent the
burden of GSI for older adults. Moreover, it may allow at-
risk individuals to be targeted early (e.g., to prevent cogni-
tive impairment). Such efforts will have a large public
health effect.
