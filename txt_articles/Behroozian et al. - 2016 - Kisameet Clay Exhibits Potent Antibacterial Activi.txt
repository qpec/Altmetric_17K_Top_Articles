ABSTRACT The ESKAPE (Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseu-
domonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter species) pathogens cause an increasing number of nosocomial infections worldwide since
they escape the inhibitory effect of the available antibiotics and the immune response. Here, we report the broad-spectrum and
potent antibacterial activity of Kisameet clay, a natural clay mineral from British Columbia, Canada, against a group of
multidrug-resistant ESKAPE strains. The results suggest that this natural clay might be developed as a therapeutic option for the
treatment of serious infections caused by these important pathogens.
IMPORTANCE More than 50 years of misuse and overuse of antibiotics has led to a plague of antibiotic resistance that threatens to
reduce the efficacy of antimicrobial agents available for the treatment of infections due to resistant organisms. The main threat is
nosocomial infections in which certain pathogens, notably the ESKAPE organisms, are essentially untreatable and contribute to
increasing mortality and morbidity in surgical wards. The pipeline of novel antimicrobials in the pharmaceutical industry is es-
sentially empty. Thus, there is a great need to seek for new sources for the treatment of recalcitrant infectious diseases. We de-
scribe experiments that demonstrate the efficacy of a “natural” medicine, Kisameet clay, against all of the ESKAPE strains. We
suggest that this material is worthy of clinical investigation for the treatment of infections due to multidrug-resistant organisms.

T
he ESKAPE group of bacterial pathogens (Enterococcus fae-
cium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acineto-
bacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter spe-
cies) is responsible for a majority of hospital-acquired infections
and presents critical threats in nosocomial pathogenesis, trans-
mission, and resistance (1). They are so named since they “escape”
the activity of all available antimicrobial agents and cause exten-
sive morbidity and mortality in infected patients (1, 2). They are
predicted to be of increasing relevance in infectious disease for the
foreseeable future, but the current antibiotic armamentarium has
little to offer in terms of treatment, and there are few novel anti-
microbial agents under development that show promise in reliev-
ing the health crisis caused by these organisms (3).
Clay minerals are naturally occurring layered phyllosilicates
with stable crystalline structures, very fine particle sizes
(�2.0 �m), and large surface areas (4). Some show antimicrobial
or other therapeutic properties, and they have a long history in the
treatment of human diseases (5, 6). However, their use is consid-
ered to be “naturopathic” medicine, and to date, none have been
approved by regulatory agencies for therapeutic applications. On
the central coast of British Columbia, Canada, northwest of Van-
couver, there exists a clay deposit, Kisameet clay (KC), which has
been used by the local First Nations (Heiltsuk) people for several
centuries and appears to have excellent therapeutic properties (7).
Anecdotal reports indicate the application of KC for a variety of
ailments, including ulcerative colitis, duodenal ulcer, arthritis,
neuritis, phlebitis, skin irritation, and burns (8, 9). Mineralogical
and chemical analyses of KC in the 1940s (7) as well as more recent
work (10) indicate that this deposit differs from other clays such as
kaolinite or bentonite. X-ray diffraction shows that KC possesses a
low clay mineral content (~24% [wt]), dominated by the presence
of biotite (S. Behroozian, S. L. Svensson, J. Tang, W. Xu, L. Li, J.
Davies, unpublished data). Moreover, as a natural clay deposit,
KC has a significant resident microbial community (1,000 to 3,000
taxa), which includes Actinobacteria, which are known to make
bioactive small molecules and may contribute to KC activity by
the production of antimicrobials (S. L. Svensson, S. Behroozian,
W. Xu, M. G. Surette, L. Li, J. Davies, unpublished data). More
recently, the antibacterial activities and physicochemical charac-
teristics of other therapeutic clay minerals have been investigated
in the laboratory (11, 12). Haydel et al. reported on the broad-
spectrum in vitro antibacterial activities of a natural iron-rich clay
(CsAgO2) that was used to treat patients with Buruli ulcer (12).
Our studies have shown that KC has potent broad-spectrum
antibacterial activity in both stationary and logarithmic phases of
growth in vitro (Behroozian et al., unpublished), and to investigate
the activity of KC against the ESKAPE pathogens, we assembled
and characterized the antibiotic resistance profiles of a collection

 of 16 strains from a number of sources in Vancouver, including
Vancouver General Hospital (VGH), St. Paul’s Hospital (SPH),
and the University of British Columbia (UBC) wastewater treat-
ment pilot plant (WWTP) (Table 1). E. faecium was grown in
Mueller-Hinton (MH) broth or on MH agar, and S. aureus was
grown in Trypticase soy (TS) broth or on TS agar plates. All other
strains were cultured in Luria-Bertani (LB) broth or on LB agar.
Standard disk diffusion tests using a panel of 36 antibiotics
showed widespread, although variable, multidrug resistance
among these strains (Table 1). The E. faecium and S. aureus strains
exhibited resistance to carbapenems, third-generation cephalo-
sporins, and penicillins, while methicillin-resistant S. aureus
(MRSA) was also resistant to first-generation cephalosporins,
quinolones, tetracyclines, nitrofurantoin, clindamycin, and eryth-
romycin. All Gram-negative strains were resistant to first- and
second-generation cephalosporins and penicillins. In addition,
K. pneumoniae, A. baumannii, and P. aeruginosa strains exhibited
resistance to third-generation cephalosporins and trimethoprim.
An in vitro assay was used to examine the effect of KC on the
ESKAPE strains. Overnight cultures were diluted into the appro-
priate growth medium to ~107 CFU/ml and incubated at 37°C
with gentle rotary mixing (200 rpm) to the mid-logarithmic phase
of growth. Cells were collected by centrifugation, washed with
sterile
phosphate-buffered
saline,
and
resuspended
at
~107 CFU/ml either in 1% (wt/vol) KC suspension (10 mg
vacuum-desiccated, ground, autoclaved clay in 1 ml deionized
distilled water) or in water only (as control) and then incubated
with gentle shaking at 37°C. Viability was determined by serial
dilution plating of aliquots removed at 0, 5, and 24 h of incuba-
tion. The presence of KC dramatically reduced the viability of all
strains tested (Fig. 1). For example, after a 5-h exposure to KC, no
viable cells of A. baumannii AB-1270, Enterobacter sp. strain MI1,
or Enterobacter sp. strain MI16 could be recovered, indicating po-
tent activity against these strains. S. aureus, K. pneumoniae,
P. aeruginosa, A. baumannii AB-1264, and Enterobacter cloacae
1172 lost viability completely after 24 h, and the same killing took
48 h for E. faecium strains. In contrast, in water-only controls
without KC, the decline in CFU during the same period of incu-
bation was �1 log10 for all Gram-negative strains and ~1 to 3 log10
for E. faecium and S. aureus strains, respectively.
Conclusion. The ESKAPE pathogens are responsible for the
majority of recalcitrant bacterial outbreaks in nosocomial set-
tings, but the therapeutic choices are extremely limited. Despite
intensive searches for new antimicrobial agents, there are few ac-
tive candidates in the pipeline. Here, we show the bactericidal
effect of KC, a natural mineral clay, against a panel of both Gram-
positive and Gram-negative multidrug-resistant ESKAPE strains.
In addition to its antibacterial activity, KC has an antifungal prop-
erty. It also effectively disperses biofilms of S. aureus and P. aerugi-
nosa and prevents their formation (Behroozian et al., unpub-
lished). Moreover, aqueous extracts of KC (without mineral
particles) demonstrate the same broad-spectrum antibacterial ac-
tivity, suggesting that the active component(s) can be extracted
and used in defined preparations. Although there are differences
in susceptibility between isolates of the same species, to date no
resistance to KC has been observed. The Heiltsuk nation employ
KC in geophagia for a variety of internal ailments, suggesting that
this natural mineral might be an option for treatment of intracta-
ble infections such as Clostridium difficile.
We suggest that the broad-spectrum antibacterial activity of
KC may be a valuable option for the treatment of ESKAPE infec-
tions, especially in last-resort situations. It remains to be seen if
KC acts synergistically with common antimicrobials to potentiate
their activity against resistant pathogens. To date, no toxic side
effects have been reported in the human use of KC (9), and de-
tailed in vivo studies in animal models and cytotoxicity investiga-
tions remain to be carried out. Nonetheless, such ancient medic-
inals and other natural mineral-based agents may provide new
