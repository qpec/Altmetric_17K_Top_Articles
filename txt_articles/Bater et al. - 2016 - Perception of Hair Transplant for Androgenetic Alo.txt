IMPORTANCE Hair transplant is among the most common cosmetic services sought by men,
with more than 11 000 procedures performed in 2014. Despite its growing popularity, the
effect of hair transplant on societal perceptions of youth, attractiveness, or facets of
workplace and social success is unknown.
OBJECTIVES To determine whether hair transplant improves observer ratings of age,
attractiveness, successfulness, and approachability in men treated for androgenetic alopecia
and to quantify the effect of hair transplant on each of these domains.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A randomized controlled experiment was conducted
from November 10 to December 6, 2015, using web-based surveys featuring photographs of
men before and after hair transplant. One hundred twenty-two participants recruited
through various social media platforms successfully completed the survey. Observers were
shown 2 side-by-side images of each man and asked to compare the image on the left with
the one on the right. Of 13 pairs of images displayed, 7 men had undergone a hair transplant
procedure and 6 had served as controls. Observers evaluated each photograph using various
metrics, including age, attractiveness, successfulness, and approachability. A multivariate
analysis of variance was performed to understand the effect of hair transplant on observer
perceptions. Planned posthypothesis testing was used to identify which variables changed
significantly as a result of the transplant.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Observer ratings of age (in number of years younger) and
attractiveness, successfulness, and approachability (on a scale of 0 to 100; scores higher than
50 indicate a positive change).
RESULTS Of the 122 participants in the survey, 58 were men (47.5%); mean (range) age was
27.1 (18-52) years. The initial multivariate analysis of variance revealed a statistically significant
multivariate effect for transplant (Wilks λ = 0.9646; P < .001). Planned posthypothesis
analyses were performed to examine individual differences across the 4 domains. Findings
determined with t tests showed a significant positive effect of hair transplant on observers’
perceptions of age (mean [SD] number of years younger, 3.6 [2.9] years; P < .001),
attractiveness (mean [SD] score, 58.5 [17.5]; P < .001), successfulness (mean [SD] score, 57.1
[17.1]; P = .008), and approachability (mean [SD] score, 59.2 [18.1]; P = .02).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Men were perceived as being younger and more attractive by
casual observers after undergoing hair transplant. Participants also rated posttransplant faces
as appearing more successful and approachable relative to their pretransplant counterparts.
These aspects have been shown to play a substantial role in both workplace and social
success, and these data demonstrate that hair transplant can improve ratings universally
across all 4 domains.

A
ndrogeneticalopecia(AGA)isacommonconditionthat
leads to varying degrees of hair loss in both men and
women. It has been estimated1 that rates of AGA in men
older than 40 years approach 50%. Hair loss in affected indi-
viduals is progressive and assumes 1 of 7 characteristic pat-
terns as classified by the Norwood-Hamilton scale.2,3 There ex-
ists a pathophysiologic association between this type of hair
loss and androgen exposure,4 a link that has been integral in
the development of medical treatment for AGA.5
Despite the fact that AGA is a prevalent condition evalu-
ated in the dermatologic community, it has not garnered the
attention that might be expected for such a common condi-
tion.ThisislikelyaresultofAGAoftenbeingregardedasamild
dermatologic condition or cosmetic disorder.6,7 Androge-
netic alopecia may appear to be of little medical consequence
sinceitisnottypicallyassociatedwithsignificantmedicalmor-
bidity or mortality,8 and there is not a significant disruption
of normal physiologic functioning. However, this character-
ization fails to acknowledge the profound psychosocial impli-
cations of hair loss on self-esteem and identity.
There is a growing body of literature aimed at elucidating
the effect of hair loss on quality of life. Studies9 demonstrate
that individuals experiencing hair loss have reduced
self-esteem and self-confidence as well as higher self-
consciousness, all of which may place them at a social disad-
vantage. This supposition is reinforced by literature10,11
reporting that men who are balding are rated poorly com-
pared with men who are not balding in domains such as
physical attractiveness, likeability, and overall life (career and
personal) success. These realities provide strong motivation
for individuals affected by AGA to seek treatment for this
condition.
The mainstay of treatment for AGA can be divided into 2
categories: medical and surgical. Both minoxidil and finaste-
ride have been approved by the US Food and Drug Adminis-
tration for use in AGA.5,12 Although the mechanism of action
of minoxidil is not completely understood, it has been shown5
to slow the rate of hair loss and, to a much lesser extent, in-
crease hair growth and survival. The use of finasteride, a 5-α
reductase inhibitor, is based on the association between AGA
and androgen exposure. Finasteride prevents the conversion
of testosterone to dihydroxytestosterone via enzyme inhibi-
tion, and the congenital absence of this enzyme is associated
with a population-wide absence of AGA.13 Clinical trials con-
firmed the efficacy of finasteride; men had significantly less
hair loss.14,15
For many, medical treatment alone does not provide de-
sired results and surgical treatment of AGA has gained popu-
larity over the past several decades.12 Hair restoration sur-
gery in mainstream medicine dates back to the 1950s, and the
seminal article describing this technique details the use of
4-mm punch grafts.16 Today the most widely used technique
is micrografting by the traditional strip method or the follicu-
lar unit extraction method.17,18 This outpatient procedure re-
quires a great deal of technical skill and endurance on the part
of the surgeon since it can take multiple hours to dissect the
follicles. However, patients perceive micrografting positively
owing to the favorable risk-benefit ratio.18 These factors have
undoubtedly contributed to the growing popularity of hair
transplant in recent years.
In 2014, hair transplant was among the most common cos-
metic services sought by men, with more than 11 000 proce-
dures performed.19 Despite its growing popularity, few stud-
ies have explored the effect of hair transplant on societal
perceptions. Through this study, we aimed to determine
whether hair transplant improves observer ratings of age, at-
tractiveness, successfulness, and approachability in men
treated for AGA. In addition, we sought to quantify the effect
of hair transplant on each domain.
Methods
Participants
One hundred twenty-two participants (63 women and 58 men;
1 declined to specify sex) completed the study from Novem-
ber 10, 2015, to December 6, 2015. Ages of study participants
ranged from 18 to 52 years. Survey takers were excluded from
the study if they were younger than 18 years or had psychiat-
ric conditions, such as schizophrenia or an autism spectrum
disorder, owing to differences in how these individuals direct
attention toward a face as well as how they convey and infer
emotional states from a face.20 Participants were naive to the
specific purpose of the study. Institutional review board ap-
proval was obtained for this study from Johns Hopkins Medi-
cine Institutional Review Boards. The first page of the survey
described the task and relevant exclusion criteria. Respon-
dents were notified that continuing on to the survey would
serve as informed consent for their participation. Survey tak-
ers were also informed that they would be eligible to enter a
drawing for a $20 Amazon gift card upon successful comple-
tion of the survey by entering their email address.

selected from a separate research photograph database of pa-
tients to ensure that these individuals had not undergone sig-
nificantcosmeticproceduresbetweenthe2photographs.Con-
trols were demographically matched according to age and sex
to the surgical patients.
Six of the selected men did not have a hair restoration pro-
cedure in the time between their 2 photographs and were con-
sidered controls. Seven of the selected men had undergone a
hair transplant procedure, each of whom had a pretransplant
and a posttransplant photograph displayed. Observers were
shown2side-by-sideimagesofeachmanandaskedtorateage,
attractiveness, successfulness, and approachability by com-
paring the image on the left with the one on the right (Figure 1).
Each survey contained all 13 pairs of photographs. The order
in which the pairs of photographs were presented was ran-
domized for each survey taker.
Surveys were built using Qualtrics Survey Software (Qual-
trics). A link was disseminated via various social media plat-
forms. Survey questions were designed to assess observer per-
ceptions when comparing 2 images of each man. Participants
were asked to evaluate how much younger the individual in
the photograph on the right appeared relative to the photo-
graph on the left. They were provided with a 10-point scale,
as well as the option to select 0 if they did not believe that the
person on the right appeared younger. Observers were also
askedtoranktheperceivedattractiveness,successfulness,and
approachability of the image on the right compared with the
image on the left. For these measures, survey takers were pro-
vided with a 100-point slider bar. The bar began at 50, which
corresponded to no difference. Moving the bar to the right cor-
responded to a positive change in these measures, while mov-
ing the bar to the left corresponded to a more negative rating.
The order of the photographs was standardized: in the hair
transplant group, the photograph on the left was always the
pretransplant image and the photograph on the right was the
posttransplant image.
Statistical Analysis
We performed our statistical analysis using Stata, version 13
SE (StataCorp). Observer ratings across each of 4 domains (age,
attractiveness, successfulness, and approachability) were col-
lectedandstudied.Ourprimarygoalwastodeterminewhether
a statistically significant difference in observer ratings ex-
istedbetweenthecontrolandtransplantgroups.Followingthis
determination, we aimed to identify the domains in which sta-
tistically significant changes existed. We conducted a 1-way
multivariate analysis of variance with 4 dependent variables
(age,attractiveness,successfulness,andapproachability)using
1 factor (transplant) with 2 levels (control and transplant). This
test allowed us to determine whether the hair transplant af-
fected any of the domains of interest. Planned posthypoth-
esis testing (unpaired, 2-tailed t test) was used to determine
which of the variables changed significantly as a result of the
transplant.
Next, we estimated the effect size for the domains of
interest using a standardized mean difference and ordinal
rank change approach. Variance component analysis of the
data allowed us to separate variances due to participant
biases from the regression residuals, and thus obtain more
precise estimates of the true variances of the population’
s
attractiveness, successfulness, and approachability distribu-
tions. These variances were used to normalize the measured
differences and calculate a standardized mean difference
(Cohen d corrected for observer bias). Two standardized
mean differences are presented: (1) differences measured in
men who underwent hair transplant from the test baseline,
and (2) differences between the no-transplant and trans-
plant groups. Estimated ordinal rank change was obtained as
follows: 100 random individuals were rank ordered from
lowest to highest in a domain of interest, a hair transplant
was performed on the 50th individual (ie, one of average
attractiveness in a group of 100 men), and the group was
then re-ordered. The estimated ordinal rank change repre-
sents the change in ranking of the individual who had a hair
transplant. Using the attractiveness domain as an example,
after the person ranked 50th receives a hair transplant, he
should be ranked between 59 and 69 (higher number corre-
sponding to a more favorable position). Mean differences are
presented for test baseline to measured effect (baseline) and
measured effect to nontransplanted controls (bias cor-
rected). To estimate the ordinal rank change we integrated
and scaled the appropriate normal distributions in Math-
ematica, version 10.3 (Mathematica), which provided an
approximation for how much a hair transplant will shift the
ordinal rankings of average individuals, as defined above,
within the domains of interest.
Results
One hundred twenty-two participants successfully com-
pleted the survey. They were heterogeneous with respect to
age, sex, and educational level (Table 1). Participants also re-
ported self-rated attractiveness on a scale of 0 to 100, with 0
being least attractive and 100 being most attractive.

The raw data were gathered and studied to glean initial im-
pressions of survey responses. Observer gradings of age, at-
tractiveness, successfulness, and approachability are plotted
in Figure 2.
These results demonstrated changes in observer grad-
ingsbetweenthetransplantandnontransplantgroups.Theini-
tial MANOVA revealed a statistically significant multivariate
effect for transplant (Wilks λ = 0.9646 [P < .001]; Pillai

[P < .001]; Roy largest root,24,25 0.0367 [P < .001]). Planned
posthypothesis t tests were performed to determine which of
the variables changed significantly as a result of the trans-
plant. Each dependent variable was tested separately, and the
results are summarized in Table 2. The data demonstrate that
men who undergo hair transplant are graded as younger and
more attractive, successful, and approachable than their pre-
transplant counterparts.
Effect sizes of hair transplant on attractiveness, success-
fulness, and approachability are listed in Table 3. Individuals

CI, 3.4-3.8) years younger after a hair transplant and 1.1 (95%
CI, 0.8-1.3) years younger than the control group.
Discussion
The rationale for the study design was based on the wisdom
of the crowd theory, which suggests that the judgments of a
collective group will be more accurate than the individual con-
tributions of its members. Sir Francis Galton26 popularized this
theory in the early 1900s when he asked a large group of in-
dividuals to guess the weight of an ox. Although the indi-
vidual guesses were wide ranging, the group’
s collective av-
eragewasclosetothecorrectweight.Useofthistheoryremains
pervasive in modern society, contributing to estimations of,
for example, the stock market and political elections.27,28 Simi-
larly, we relied on this theory when conducting our survey to
understand societal perceptions. Despite a large range in in-
dividual ratings among participants, we trust that the mean
grading of each transplant recipient will accurately represent
the ratings attributed to these faces by society as a whole.
The data presented in this study indicate what we believe
to be novel findings regarding hair restoration surgery. Analy-
ses revealed statistically significant effects of hair transplant
on observer gradings of youth. Men were reported to look
younger after hair transplant. Men who underwent this pro-
cedure were also perceived as being more attractive, success-
ful, and approachable than their pretransplant counterparts
by casual observers. The improvement across these domains
is significant, and the results from the integration of the stan-
dardized mean differences allow us to present data in a way
we believe will be meaningful to both patients and physi-
cians. By converting these values to number of people per 100,
we have been able to provide a measure of how much an av-
erage person will improve in a given domain’
s rankings after

undergoing a hair transplant. For example, if 100 people were
randomly sampled and then ranked and ordered according to
their attractiveness, the effect of hair transplant for an aver-
agepatientwouldresultinmovingfromposition50to69,with
higher values corresponding to a more positive rating. For suc-
cessfulness and approachability rankings, men would move
from position 50 to positions 68 and 71 after transplant, re-
spectively.
Previousstudies9,10,29havedescribedthepsychosocialcon-
sequences of hair loss. Many of these consequences were re-
lated to self-perceptions and included diminished self-esteem
and a lost sense of identity. The present study did not focus on
self-image or ratings, but enhancing our understanding of the
patients’perceptions following this procedure would further
augment this body of literature. Our study did, however, delve
into the societal perceptions of men before and after surgery.
It has been shown10,11 that men who have lost hair are con-
sidered less attractive, less likeable, and less successful. Our
results validate these findings in that men who had not un-
dergone transplant are judged less favorably across these do-
mains than are those who receive a transplant. In addition to
validating the literature that suggests hair loss in men is asso-
ciated with a social penalty, these data provide essential in-
formation about the efficacy of hair transplant in improving
observerperceptions.Theresultsofthepresentstudymaysug-
gest that the hair transplant procedure can ameliorate some
of the societal consequences of hair loss in men with AGA.
Although the results of this study proved statistically
sound,asapiloteffort,werecognizethelimitationsofthesmall
populationandsurveydesign.First,thesurveycomprisedonly
13 sets of photographs. Although sufficient for this type of pre-
liminary study, follow-up studies will aim to expand and di-
versify the images shown within the survey to make the data
more generalizable. The images used in the survey were se-
lected from a photograph database and lacked standardiza-
tion. In addition, studies have shown30 that lighting can alter
facial perception. A more uniform selection of photographs
with regard to lighting and background would be needed to
avoid biasing observer ratings. We also elected to show pho-
tographs with the individuals in repose. It has been shown31
that smiling has a significant effect on observer perception of
personalitytraits.Therefore,thisneutralfacialexpressionmay
have negatively affected ratings of attractiveness, successful-
ness, and approachability. Additional studies will be required
to examine the differences in ratings when individuals are in
smile and repose expressions to understand the effect of fa-
cial expression on observer perceptions.
There was also bias introduced by the survey design. For
each set of photographs, the observer was asked to compare
the image on the right with the image on the left. These in-
structions primed viewers to expect a difference between the
2 photographs in favor of the one on the right, but we pur-
sued this study design to reduce potential survey fatigue and
confusion. To understand the effect of image presentation on
observer ratings, we included 6 pairs of control images with
men who had not undergone hair transplant. The ratings of the
control images revealed an observer preference for the image
on the right; this individual was most often rated as younger
and more attractive, successful, and approachable. Under-
standing the standardized mean differences and ordinal rank
change for hair transplant recipients relative to controls was
used to control for this potential bias. Even after accounting
for this bias, hair transplant recipients still ranked 9 positions
more attractive, 5 positions more successful, and 5 positions
more approachable on a 0- to 100-point scale, with higher val-
ues corresponding to a more-positive rating. We expect that
the true effect of the hair transplant procedure on each do-
main lies between the raw values and the values obtained af-
ter comparing the gradings of hair transplant recipients with
those of controls. To better understand the value of the hair
transplantoneachdomain,futurestudiesshouldincludemore
sophisticated randomization of pretransplant and posttrans-
plant photographs.
A final point of consideration that becomes increasingly
important as we aim to measure the effect size of a hair trans-
plant is the candidacy of the recipient. There are many fac-
tors that contribute to the appropriateness of transplant, in-
cluding age, pattern of hair loss, and number of follicular units
needed to transplant. Due to the random image selection, we
included a range of ages and variety of hair loss patterns. In
addition, the men in this study had undergone what are con-
sidered to be small procedures on average of 1200 grafts. Thus,

observers are asked to make judgments about results that may
be subtle considering the small graft sizes. We believe that the
effect size of this procedure will increase with better candi-
dacy (eg, younger men), individuals with increasing amounts
of hair loss, and those undergoing larger-sized grafts. Even af-
ter the above limitations are considered, the data prove to be
robust, and this study should serve as a proof of concept for
future investigations into the effect of cosmetic procedures on
societal perceptions.
