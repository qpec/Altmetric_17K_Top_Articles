Estrogenic endocrine disrupting chemicals have been shown to disrupt maternal behavior in ro-
dents. We investigated the effects of an emerging xenoestrogen, bisphenol S (BPS), on maternal
behavior and brain in CD-1 mice exposed during pregnancy and lactation (F0 generation) and in
female offspring exposed during gestation and perinatal development (F1 generation). We ob-
served different effects in F0 and F1 dams for a number of components of maternal behavior,
including time on the nest, time spent on nest building, latency to retrieve pups, and latency to
retrieve the entire litter. We also characterized expression of estrogen receptor a in the medial
preoptic area (MPOA) and quantified tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactive cells in the ventral
tegmental area, 2 brain regions critical for maternal care. BPS-treated females in the F0 generation
had a statistically significant increase in estrogen receptor a expression in the caudal subregion of
the central MPOA in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, there were no statistically significant
effects of BPS on the MPOA in F1 dams or the ventral tegmental area in either generation. This work
demonstrates that BPS affects maternal behavior and brain with outcomes depending on gener-
ation, dose, and postpartum period. Many studies examining effects of endocrine disrupting
chemicals view the mother as a means by which offspring can be exposed during critical periods of
development. Here, we demonstrate that pregnancy and lactation are vulnerable periods for the
mother. We also show that developmental BPS exposure alters maternal behavior later in adult-
hood. Both findings have potential public health implications. (Endocrinology 158: 516–530, 2017)
I
n the rat, estrogens play an important role in the reg-
ulation of maternal behaviors via estrogen receptor a
(ERa) signaling in the medial preoptic area (MPOA) of
the forebrain (1–6). The MPOA is critical for the onset of
maternal behavior, and lesions to this area abolish ma-
ternal care (2, 7–9). In the mouse, the onset of maternal
behavior is not strictly dependent on the high levels of
estrogen produced during late pregnancy; nulliparous
females demonstrate spontaneous maternal behavior
(10–14), as do ovariectomized and aromatase knockout
mice (14, 15). However, there is evidence indicating a
role for estrogen (14–16) and demonstrating the im-
portance of ERa in the display of mouse maternal be-
havior (17, 18).
Endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) with ER ag-
onist activities such as the xenoestrogen bisphenol A
(BPA) (19–22) can interfere with a broad range of
physiological processes, including neural development
and reproduction (23). BPA induces deleterious physio-
logical effects in a number of tissues (19, 24, 25), in-
cluding structural changes in brain regions that are
associated with changes in behavior (26). A small number
of studies suggest that BPA can alter maternal behaviors
in rodents (27–32). In 1 study, female mice exposed to
10 mg BPA/kg/d during pregnancy days 14 to 18 spent
less time nursing and less time on the nest compared with
unexposed females (28). Interestingly, the same effects
were observed in the F1 offspring (exposed on gestational

 days 14 to 18). Yet, when females exposed prenatally
were exposed again during pregnancy, no alterations in
maternal behaviors were observed (28). This evidence
suggests that xenoestrogen exposures can alter maternal
behavior and that the timing of exposure might be crit-
ical; pregnancy as well as the developmental period may
be sensitive to endocrine disruption. To our knowledge,
studies examining the effects of BPA and other EDCs on
maternal behavior have not yet investigated the potential
underlying neural mechanisms.
Due to public health concerns with BPA, alternative
chemicals have been developed for use in consumer
products. One replacement, bisphenol S (BPS), is cur-
rently used in baby bottles, thermal receipts, consumer
paper products, and personal care products and has been
detected in foodstuffs and canned foods (33–36). Bio-
monitoring studies reveal that human exposures to BPS
are likely to be low but widespread (37) and have in-
creased over the last decade (38). Although BPS has not
been examined extensively, several studies indicate that
this compound displays estrogenic properties in both
genomic and membrane-associated estrogen signaling
similar to BPA (39–41). To date, studies of BPS in mammals
are limited, and there are very few studies investigating the
effects of exposure on behavior or brain (42, 43). Fur-
thermore, to our knowledge, there are no studies examining
whether this compound disrupts maternal behavior or the
maternal brain.
We postulated that low-dose exposures to BPS would
affect maternal behavior and related neural structures in
both dams (the F0 generation) and their offspring (F1
females) in adulthood. Given that one mechanism of
endocrine disruption is altered hormone receptor ex-
pression, we examined the effects of BPS on ERa ex-
pression in the MPOA. In addition, we investigated
tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity, a marker for
dopaminergic cells, in the ventral tegmental area (VTA), a
brain region receiving functional input from the MPOA.
The MPOA output to the VTA is also important for
maternal motivation (44, 45). Dopaminergic neural cir-
cuits in the MPOA are involved in the regulation of the
onset and maintenance of maternal behavior in rats;
Numan and Stolzenberg (44) proposed that estradiol and
dopamine may act through the same signaling cascades
during the onset of maternal behavior. Further evidence
indicates that estrogen-sensitive oxytocin neurons project
from the MPOA to the VTA (46–48). Thus, we hy-
pothesized that both the MPOA and VTA would be
sensitive to BPS. EDCs have been shown to cause long-
term effects, including some following developmental
exposures that may not manifest until adulthood and
others that may only be apparent under specific condi-
tions (i.e., after parturition). Here, we investigated
potential effects of BPS exposures on maternal behavior
and in neural regions important for maternal behavior.
We tested the hypothesis that exposures to BPS affect the
F0 generation exposed during pregnancy and lactation
and the F1 generation exposed in utero and during the
perinatal period. Our results suggest that BPS induces
different effects on the F0 and F1 females.
Method
Animals
Timed pregnant female CD-1 mice (Charles River Labora-
tories, Raleigh, NC) were individually housed (until parturition)
in polysulfone cages with food (ProLab IsoDiet, Brentwood,
MO), which has been reported to have minimal estrogenic ac-
tivity (49)] and tap water (in glass bottles) provided ad libitum.
The animals were maintained in temperature- and light-controlled
(12 hours light, 12 hours dark, lights on at 0800 h) conditions at
the University of Massachusetts, Amherst Central Animal Facility.
All experimental procedures were approved by the University of
Massachusetts Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.
Beginning on pregnancy day 8, pregnant females were
weighed daily. On day 8, dams were randomly allocated to
treatment groups using statistical software that allowed normal
distribution in each treatment group based on body weight.
From pregnancy day 9 to lactational day 20, dams ingested a small
wafer (Nabisco, East Hanover, NJ) treated with BPS or vehicle
alone (70% ethanol). All ethanol was dried to completion prior to
feeding (50). Wafers were dosed with solutions designed to deliver
2 or 200 mg BPS/kg/d (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA,
catalog no. sc-238983, 99% purity) (n = 15 to 17 for each dose).
BPSdosagewasadjustedforbodyweightdaily.The200-mg/kg/ddose
was selected because it appeared to alter some aspects of maternal
behavior in a pilot study (data not shown). This dose is higher
than suspected human exposure levels (37); thus, we also
selected a lower dose of 2 mg/kg/d, which approaches human
exposures. Both doses of BPS are far below the toxicological no
observed adverse effect level of 10 mg/kg/d based on parental
toxicity in a guideline developmental toxicity assay (51), and thus
both doses would be characterized as “low” (52). During wafer
administration, dams were briefly transferred to clean cages.
During the lactational period, care was taken to avoid potential
effects of separation (53). In addition, pups were not handled
during this period to avoid potential effects of handling.
Dams delivered naturally [birth designated lactational day
(LD) 0]. Litters were culled to 10 pups on LD1; male and female
pups were kept in all litters (54). A small number of dams had
fewer than 10 pups, and thus no pups were culled in these litters.
Litters were weaned on LD21 and separated by sex. Two F1
female offspring from each F0 dam were raised to adulthood,
mated with unexposed CD-1 males (Charles River Laborato-
ries), and tested for maternal behavior using the same assays at
the same time points across lactation as used to test their
mothers. A schematic illustrating the exposure paradigm and
timing of behavioral evaluations is shown in Figure 1.
Maternal behavior assays
For both the F0 and F1 generations, maternal behavior was
assessed on LD2, 7, and 14. First, dams were observed without
intervention for a period of 90 minutes at the beginning of the

 light phase. Observations were recorded every 3 minutes for the
following measures: dam position on/off nest, self-care (self-
grooming, eating, drinking), sleeping/resting, nest repair, and
pup licking/grooming. At the end of the observational period,
the dam and pups were gently removed from the cage. The
dimensions of the nest were measured (55). Two independent
observers scored the nest quality using a modified 5-point Hess
scale (56). All litters were evaluated for these measures, re-
gardless of size.
Finally, dams were assessed for pup retrieval. Following nest
measurement, the pups were scattered in the cage at the end
opposite the nest, and the dams were returned to the nest area.
The latency to first touch 1 or more pups and the latency to
retrieve each pup to the nest were recorded for a period of 10
minutes. To account for differences in litter size, only those
litters with 9 to 10 pups were analyzed in pup retrieval assays.
Furthermore, because a percentage of dams did not retrieve
pups, regardless of treatment, some evaluations were conducted
only in “active” retrieving dams (17).
Open-field behavioral assay
Dams were tested on pregnancy day 16 and LD10/11 using
an open-field apparatus 40 cm 3 40 cm 3 40 cm (42). Measures
were scored by 2 independent observers blind to treatment
group, including rearing against the walls, rearing (without
contact with walls), freeze/stops, and grooming events.
Immunohistochemistry
Brains were collected from F0 dams on LD21 and from F1
dams on LD2 or LD21 and fixed in neutral buffered formalin
(10%) (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA). Brains were sectioned
in the transverse plane at 40 mm, and the MPOA and VTA were
identified using a mouse brain atlas (57, 58). Free-floating
sections were processed for immunoreactivity to ERa or ty-
rosine hydroxylase (TH, the rate-limiting enzyme in catechol-
amine synthesis, used as a marker for dopaminergic cells).
Antigen retrieval was performed using 0.01 citric acid buffer
(pH 6.0), followed by quenching of endogenous peroxidases
using 3% hydrogen peroxide in methanol. Sections were
washed, blocked with normal goat serum in 1.5% milk, and
incubated overnight at 4°C with rabbit anti-ERa antibody di-
rected against the C-terminus of the rat ERa (1:20,000 anti-ERa
C1355; Millipore, Temecula, CA; catalog number 06-935,
RRID AB_ 310305, lots 2488982, 2517829, and 2697437) or a
polyclonal antibody for TH (1:2000; Abcam, Cambridge, MA;
ab112, RRID AB_297840, lots GR-193639-4 and GR-166961-3).
Sections were then washed and incubated with biotin-labeled
secondary antibody (goat anti–rabbit, Ab64256; Abcam) fol-
lowed by streptavidin peroxidase complex (Ab64269; Abcam).
Colorimetric detection using diaminobenzidine (DAB) chromo-
gen and substrate (ab64238; Abcam) was followed by a wash in
tap water. Sections were stored in phosphate-buffered saline with
0.1% Tween-20 until mounted on slides, dehydrated, and cover-
slipped. Details about the antibodies are included in Table 1.
One image per section was collected using a Zeiss Axi-
oImager dissection microscope (3120 magnification for
MPOA; 3100 magnification for VTA) and Zeiss high-
resolution color camera (Carl Zeiss Microscopy, Thornwood,
NY). ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda,
MD) was used to convert the image from red, green, and blue
color to 8 bit, subtract background, and automatically
threshold. Cells expressing ERa in the MPOA and TH in the
VTA were counted on anatomically matched sections. Owing to

 limitations in the quantification of DAB coloration, we did not
measure staining intensity (59, 60). For feasibility reasons, ERa
expression was quantified in 2 MPOA sections per animal: 1
from the rostral central MPOA (cMPOA), ;0.14 mm from the
bregma, and 1 from the caudal cMPOA, ;0.02 mm from the
bregma, by an observer blind to treatment. The cMPOA, which
was selected because it is essential for pup retrieval in the mouse,
was identified using neuroanatomical landmarks as described in
Tsuneoka et al. (61). The VTA was identified using neuroan-
atomical landmarks (57, 58) and TH immunoreactivity as
demonstrated in Yamaguchi et al. (62). TH immunoreactivity
was assessed in one section located ;2.92 from the bregma. For
the MPOA, ERa labeling in the bed nucleus of the stria ter-
minalis and the ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus were
used as positive controls. This antibody has been validated in
brain tissue [see Kelly et al. (63)]. For the VTA, TH labeling in
the arcuate nucleus was used as a positive control. The speci-
ficity of the TH antibody is provided by the vendor using
Western blot analysis. For both the MPOA and the VTA,
sections without primary antibodies were used as negative
controls.
Statistical analysis
Behavioral and immunohistochemical analyses were con-
ducted by observers blind to treatment groups. Data were
analyzed using SPSS version 22 (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL). For
assessments of maternal behavior, continuous variable data
were analyzed using 2-way analysis of variance general linear
model analyses with lactational day and treatment as inde-
pendent variables, followed by Bonferroni post hoc tests. Open-
field data were analyzed using 1-way analysis of variance with
treatment as the independent variable. Categorical data were
analyzedusing x2. Data wereconsidered statistically significant at
P , 0.05. Graphs illustrate means 6 SEs unless otherwise stated.
Graphs indicate post hoc statistical analyses only when treatment
was statistically significant in the 2-way analysis of variance.
Sample sizes for individual end points are provided in Table 2.
Results
Infanticide and maternal neglect were observed
in F1 but not F0 dams exposed to BPS
BPS treatment did not affect litter size, litter weight on
LD1, average pup weight on LD1, or the sex ratio
(% male pups) of litters born to either the F0 or the F1
generation (Table 3). No examples of infanticide or se-
vere neglect were observed in the F0 dams for any
treatment. However, moderate neglect, including poor
cleaning of the pups and pups retaining their umbilical
cords, was observed in 18% of F0 dams exposed to
2 mg BPS/kg/d (x2, P = 0.08 compared with controls).
In the F1 generation, infanticide and severe neglect
(requiring euthanasia of some pups or the entire litter)
were observed in 13% of females exposed to 2 mg BPS/kg/d
(Table 3). More moderate examples of poor care were
also observed in the F1 generation, including pups that
were stuck together, improperly cleaned, or severely
bruised on LD1 (Table 3). Collectively, these results
suggest that BPS may induce alterations to instru-
mental maternal care in females exposed during early
development.
BPS exposure alters time spent on the nest
and nest building in the home cage
To assess the effects of BPS exposure on maternal
behavior, dams were observed in their home cage without
any experimental intervention. In typical control dams,
time spent on the nest decreases over the postpartum
period as the pups move about the cage independently
[Fig. 2(A)]. F0 dams exposed to 200 mg BPS/kg/d spent

 significantly more time on the nest on LD14, suggesting a
failure to extinguish nesting behavior in these dams [Fig.
2(A)]. No significant differences between treatment
groups were observed in F0 females at any other time
evaluated. Strikingly, in the F1 generation, dams exposed
to either 2 or 200 mg BPS/kg/d during development spent
significantly less time on the nest on both LD2 and LD7
compared with controls [Fig. 2(A)]. BPS did not alter the
time dams spent grooming pups in either the F0 or F1
generation [Fig. 2(B)]. The time that dams spent building
and repairing the nest was also evaluated. In F0 dams,
BPS treatment did not affect time spent nest building.
However, in the F1 generation, dams that were de-
velopmentally exposed to 200 mg BPS/kg/d spent more
time nest building on LD14 compared with controls [Fig.
2(C)]. Collectively, these results suggest that dams ex-
posed to BPS as adults experience modest changes to
traditional measures of maternal behavior (e.g., failure to
extinguish high levels of care in the later postpartum
period), whereas females exposed to BPS during devel-
opment experience more detrimental changes to maternal
behavior (e.g., failure to stay on the nest during early and
midpostpartum periods).
BPS affects nest size in the F0 but not F1 generation
The internal volume of the nest was calculated using
the average internal diameter of the nest, measured
using the internal walls constructed from a single cotton
nestlet, and the average nest depth. In the F0 generation,
dams treated with 2 mg BPS/kg/d were found to have
smaller nests on LD2 compared with controls. There
were no significant differences in nest size between
treatments in F1 females at any point across the lac-
tational period examined (Fig. 3). Nest quality was not
affected in either the F0 or the F1 dams (data not
shown).
BPS treatment alters pup retrieval
Pup retrieval assays were conducted on LD2, LD7, and
LD14 and include measures for the latency to first touch 1
or more pups, the latency to retrieve the first pup, and the
latency to retrieve the entire litter. To control for dif-
ferences in litter size, we included only those litters
with 9 to 10 pups in our analysis. F0 dams exposed to
200 mg BPS/kg/d showed significantly longer latency to
touch the first pup on LD14. In contrast, there were no
significant differences in time to first touch pups between
treatment groups for F1 females at any time point [Fig.
4(A)]. When we evaluated retrieval times for all dams, in-
cluding those that did not retrieve 1 or more pups (retrieval
times of 600 seconds were assigned for these females), there
were no significant differences based on treatment of the
time to retrieve the first pup [Fig. 4(B)] or the time to retrieve
the entire litter [Fig. 4(C)] in either generation.
Because some females failed to retrieve any pups to the
nest and others failed to complete retrieval of the entire
litter [Supplemental Fig. 1(A)], we next evaluated only
those dams that retrieved at least 1 pup. Effects of BPS
were observed for the time to retrieve the first pup in dams
from both the F0 and F1 generations. On LD2, F0 dams
exposed to 2 mg BPS/kg/d displayed a significantly longer
latency to retrieve the first pup [Supplemental Fig. 1(B)].
In contrast, F1 dams developmentally exposed to
2 mg BPS/kg/d demonstrated significantly shorter latency
to retrieve their first pup on LD7 [Supplemental Fig. 1(B)].
Retrieval of the entire litter was common during early
parturition in females that retrieved at least 1 pup but was
never observed in late parturition [Supplemental Fig.
1(C)]. When we evaluated the time to retrieve the entire litter
in females that successfully retrieved at least 1 pup, there
were no effects of BPS in the F0 generation. However, F1
females developmentally exposed to 2 mg BPS/kg/d had
significantly shorter latency to retrieve their entire litter on
LD7 [Supplemental Fig. 1(C)]. Taken together, these results
suggest different effects of BPS on pup retrieval depending on
the period of exposure: F0 mothers that attempt retrievals
have a longer latency to interact with and retrieve pups,
whereas F1 females that attempt retrievals have a shorter
latency to interact with and retrieve pups.

 BPS does not affect behavior of F0 or F1
dams in open-field assays
To determine whether some of the differences we
observed in maternal behavior assays could be attributed
to BPS-induced changes in anxiety-like behavior or lo-
comotor activity levels, we used the open-field test to
evaluate F0 and F1 females before and after parturition.
Increased time spent in the center of the open field is
associated with lower anxiety-like behavior (64–69). In
evaluations conducted on pregnancy day 16 and LD10/11,
BPS exposure was not associated with any changes in
behavior in the open field, including the number of rears
in the center of the field or in the number of grooming
events (Fig. 5). No significant effects of BPS were ob-
served for the number of freeze/stops, number of fecal
pellets, or the number of rears on the walls of the open-
field apparatus (data not shown). Collectively, these data
suggest that BPS does not induce anxiety-like behaviors
in females exposed during pregnancy and lactation
(F0 females) or in females exposed during development
upon reaching adulthood (and pregnancy/lactation in
particular).
ERa expression in the cMPOA is affected by BPS
exposures in the F0 but not the F1 generation
To determine the effect of BPS on brain regions that are
considered relevant for maternal behavior, neural cells
expressing ERa were quantified in 2 matched sections of
the cMPOA in F0 dams (on LD21) and F1 dams (on LD2
and LD21). The first subregion of interest was selected
Figure 2. BPS exposure alters time spent on nest and time spent nest building in the home cage. (A) On LD14, F0 dams exposed to 200 mg BPS/kg/d
spent significantly more of the observed time on the nest. F1 dams developmentally exposed to both 2 and 200 mg BPS/kg/d spent significantly
less of the observed time on the nest on both LD2 and LD7 compared with controls. (B) Adult or developmental BPS exposure did not alter
observed time spent grooming pups at any point in the postpartum period, but these activities decreased over time. (C) There were no significant
changes in observed time spent nest building in F0 dams, whereas F1 dams exposed to 200 mg BPS/kg/d spent significantly more observed time
nest building on LD14. Red graphs indicate F0 dams and blue graphs indicate F1 dams. *P , 0.05, Bonferroni post hoc after significant 2-way

 from the rostral cMPOA [Fig. 6(A)], whereas the second
was selected from the caudal cMPOA [Fig. 6(B)]. BPS
treatment appeared to increase ERa expression in the
rostral cMPOA in F0 dams, but these differences were not
statistically significant [Fig. 6(C)]. We did observe a
significant increase in ERa immunoreactivity in the
caudal cMPOA in F0 dams exposed to 200 mg BPS/kg/d
relative to the control dams [Fig. 6(D)].
In contrast to the effects observed in F0 dams, there
were no significant differences in ERa expression in either
subregion of the MPOA for F1 dams at LD2 or LD21
[Fig. 6(C) and 6(D)]. These results are consistent with an
activational effect but not an organizational effect of BPS
on ERa expression in the MPOA.
TH immunoreactivity is not affected by BPS
exposure in either the F0 or the F1 generation
We next quantified TH-immunoreactive cells in the
VTA in anatomically matched sections in F0 dams on
LD21 and F1 dams on LD2 or LD21 [Fig. 7(A)]. The VTA
receives functional input from the MPOA and also plays
an important role in maternal behavior. There were no
significant effects of BPS treatment on TH immunore-
activity in the VTA in the exposed groups in either the F0
or F1 generation [Fig. 7(B)].
Discussion
To our knowledge, we have evaluated for the first time
the effects of exposure to BPS, a BPA replacement
chemical, on maternal behavior and brain in a mam-
malian model using CD-1 mice. We specifically charac-
terized the effects of BPS on F0 generation dams, exposed
during pregnancy and lactation, and F1 generation fe-
males, exposed in utero and during the perinatal period.
We found that maternal behavior is sensitive to BPS
exposure and observed different outcomes depending on
generation, postpartum period, and dose. We observed a
surprising increased incidence of infanticide in F1 females
exposed to the lower dose of BPS. Although these same
effects were not seen at the higher dose, more than 10% of
females exposed to 2 mg BPS/kg/d either killed their pups
or provided such poor instrumental maternal care that 1
or more pups needed to be euthanized. Although not
statistically significant, the neglect and poor maternal
care we observed were striking. In contrast to our be-
havioral findings, ERa expression in the MPOA was
significantly affected by BPS exposure in only the females
in the F0 generation.
With regard to maternal behavior, F0 dams exposed to
the higher dose of BPS (200 mg/kg/d) spent significantly
more time on the nest on LD14, with no significant
differences between treatment groups at other time points
across the lactational period. As pups grow and develop
and the postpartum period progresses, dams spend less
time on the nest (70). Thus, these results suggest that BPS
exposure in the F0 dams induces an extension of a be-
havior that is generally diminished by this stage of the
postpartum period; this may indicate a lack of adjustment
in the dam to the changing needs of her pups (71). In
contrast, dams of the F1 generation developmentally
exposed to either 2 or 200 mg BPS/kg/d spent significantly
more time away from the nest on LD2 and LD7 compared
with controls. During these early postpartum periods
(LD2 and LD7), the pups require protection and constant
care for their growth and survival, including attention to
thermoregulation and feeding (71, 72); thus, the F1 BPS-
exposed dams display quantitatively diminished care.
Observations suggesting an inability to attend to the
changing development and needs of the pups may also be
extended to measures of nest building. Nest building is
dependent on hormone levels during pregnancy and is
important for thermoregulation and protection of pups
[see Catanese et al. (55)]. In F1 dams, BPS treatment
increased the observed time spent nest building on LD14,
which may indicate a repetitive or obsessive-compulsive
disorder–like behavior (73–76). By this age, pups have
developed fur and are better able to thermoregulate in
comparison with earlier time points. The ability of most

generation at LD2. On LD2, F0 dams exposed to 2 mg BPS/kg/d built
significantly smaller nests compared with controls. F0 dams exposed to
200 mg BPS/kg/d also built smaller nests, but this was not significant.
There were no treatment-related effects on nest size in F1 dams at any
time point across the postpartum period. *P , 0.05, Bonferroni post

 BPS-exposed females to build a maternal nest and attend
to and groom their young indicates that the effects we
observed in some components of maternal behavior are
not due to wholesale changes in instrumental maternal
care.
Additional components of maternal behavior evalu-
ated include time to first touch and time to retrieve pups
to the nest. When all dams were evaluated, we observed
no significant effects of BPS on time to retrieve 1 or all
pups in either F0 or F1 dams and relatively modest effects
on the time to first touch pups in the F0 generation. Some
dams did not retrieve pups, even on LD2, but this failure
to retrieve was not influenced by treatment in either F0 or
F1 dams (Supplemental Fig. 1). To investigate effects of
BPS treatment on retrieval strategies, one analysis we
conducted evaluated only those dams that did retrieve
pups. In the F0 maternally “active” dams, exposure
to either dose increased the latency to interact with
pups (Supplemental Fig. 1), suggesting alterations to
approaching and retrieving pups to the safety of the nest,
which could have serious repercussions for litter survival
in the wild. In striking contrast, quantitatively opposite
effects of BPS were observed in F1 dams (Supplemental
Fig. 1). In this generation, of those dams that retrieved 1
or more pups, BPS-exposed females showed significantly
shorter latency to retrieve their first pup and significantly
shorter latency to retrieve their entire litter on LD7. It is
tempting to interpret this rapid pup retrieval as “im-
proved” maternal behavior, but it remains in question
whether more rapid retrieval should be considered an
improvement in care, as it may indicate hyperactivity,
compulsivity-like behavior, heightened stress response to

 scattered pups, or a displaced form of retrieval. Results
from open-field tests are not consistent with increased
anxiety-like behaviors in BPS-treated females in either
generation. However, preliminary data from our labo-
ratory suggest that BPS may induce hyperactivity in F1
females prior to the onset of puberty [Catanese and
Vandenberg, unpublished observations, and Kim et al.
(42)], which is consistent with the effects observed in F1
dams’ pup retrievals.
We hypothesized that the maternal brain may be
sensitive to exogenous estrogenic exposures and evalu-
ated whether BPS treatment altered 2 brain regions
considered important for maternal behavior, the MPOA
and VTA. Whereas the VTA was not affected by BPS

 exposure in either generation, we observed a signif-
icant increase in ERa expression in the caudal
cMPOA in F0 dams exposed to 200 mg BPS/kg/d on
LD21 and a nonsignificant increase in the rostral
subregion of the cMPOA in the same animals (Fig. 6).
There were no significant differences observed in ERa
expression in the cMPOA of F1 dams at either LD2 or
LD21.
The effects of overexpression of ERa are considered to
be tissue dependent (77). In the brain, for example, in-
duced overexpression of ERa in the hippocampus of
aging female rats has been shown to enhance memory
(78, 79). ERa expression is upregulated in response to
neuronal injury and is considered neuroprotective (79).
Although this present study did not investigate mecha-
nisms underlying the increase in receptor expression, ERa
expression in the MPOA is critical for maternal care in the
mouse, and its regulation remains under investigation.
Importantly, there appear to be differences in regulation
of ERa depending on stage of estrous as well as in relation
to pregnancy and lactation, indicating that endocrine
state is key in assessing ER regulation in this region.
Estradiol downregulates ERa gene expression in the
MPOA of cycling adult female rats (80), and protein

 levels fluctuate across the estrous cycle (81). Increased
messenger RNA and protein expression occur later in
pregnancy and may be regulated by transcriptional
mechanisms such as transcription rate
(3, 82, 83); receptor turnover and re-
ceptor phosphorylation may also ac-
count for increases in ER expression
(82). In the mouse, ERa expression in
the MPOA is thought to be positively
correlated with estradiol levels, but the
relationship
between
estradiol
and
ERa expression is not fully understood
(84). A recent study found that letro-
zole, an aromatase inhibitor, interfered
with pup retrieval and latency to
build a nest in ovariectomized virgin
females and induced increased mes-
senger RNA levels of ERa, indicating a
role for brain-derived estrogen in the
regulation of ERa gene expression in
the MPOA (85).
To date, there are relatively few data
to predict the effects of xenoestrogens
on ER expression in the MPOA. A
study of nonpregnant or lactating
Sprague-Dawley rats examined the ef-
fects of high doses of BPA (40 mg/kg/d)
on ERa immunoreactive cells in the
MPOA, ventromedial hypothalamus,
and arcuate nucleus. Although lactat-
ing females had fewer ERa-expressing
cells in the MPOA compared with
nonlactating females, there were no
significant effects of BPA in the lac-
tating group (86). Here, the response
to BPS we observed in the MPOA in
F0 females supports the idea that
pregnancy/lactation represents a vul-
nerable period for exposures and that
the effects may be “activational” (e.g.,
only occurring during the period of
exposure) (87–89). Determining the
mechanism underlying the increase in
ERa in the MPOA in the F0 genera-
tion, the persistence of this effect be-
yond the period of exposure, as well as
potential downstream neural and/or
genomic effects, will be important to
investigate in the future.
We were surprised to find that ERa
expression in the cMPOA of F1 dams
was not altered by developmental BPS
exposure as early life exposures to BPA
have been shown to alter ERa expression. Neonatal
exposure to 0.05 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg BPA demon-
strated dose-dependent effects; there was increased

BPS Alters Maternal Behavior and Brain in Mice

 ERa expression on postnatal day (PND) 8 and PND21 in
response to the lower 0.05-mg/kg dose and decreased
expression on PND8 and PND21 in response to the
higher 20-mg/kg dose (90). In an additional study, ma-
ternal exposure to 2, 20, or 200 mg BPA/kg/d in BALB/c
mice during pregnancy (gestational days 0 to 19) led to
dose- and sex-specific changes in the expression of gene
encoding of ERa, ERb, and ERRg in the hypothalamus
of offspring (30). Effects of 20 mg BPA/kg/d on ERa
expression in the hypothalamus of female offspring was
correlated with reduced methylation of the gene coding
for ERa. It is, of course, plausible that our F1 females may
have been affected by BPS exposure, but ERa immuno-
reactivity in the MPOA is not the appropriate measure of
this effect. Other relevant levels of analysis may include
gene expression or epigenetic modifications, as ERa
methylation status differs depending on the quality of
maternal behavior in rodents (91, 92). We cannot rule out
the possibility of effects on other neural end points not
examined or that developmental exposures to BPS may
have had early transient or stage-dependent effects;
further experiments are necessary to investigate addi-
tional end points and to uncover any potential change to
expression earlier in life. Alterations to maternal behavior
in F1 females exposed to BPS were striking, suggesting
that effects on other neural end points are likely; iden-
tifying the correct end points and establishing a causal
link between the neural and behavior effects will be
important to investigate in future work.
Prior work has demonstrated an impact of BPA (28)
and many other EDCs on maternal behavior (55, 93, 94).
Due to differences in study design, timing of treatment,
and dosage, it is difficult to compare our study with this
seminal work (28). In many studies examining de-
velopmental effects of EDCs, the dam is considered a
vessel through which offspring are exposed and thus is
rarely examined herself (55, 93). Alonso-Magdalena et al.
(95, 96) are challenging this paradigm, and strong evi-
dence suggests that pregnancy may be considered a
“vulnerable period of development” for the mother. Here
we demonstrate that adult exposures can induce both
neural and behavioral changes in exposed dams, in-
cluding changes to maternal behavior, thus suggesting
that pregnancy and the lactational period are sensitive to
endocrine disruption. It is important to note that effects
on the mother may affect her offsprings’ behavioral and
neural development (97). One major challenge is to
distinguish the direct effects of EDC exposures on the
pups from indirect effects observed in pups due to altered
maternal behaviors (28, 29, 98). In a small number of
studies, cross-fostering has been used to isolate the “di-
rect” effects of EDC exposures on the mother’s behavior
from “indirect” effects on offspring (29, 98, 99). Here,
our F1 females were directly exposed to BPS during
gestation and perinatal development, and these females
were also raised by dams that were exposed and affected
by this compound. Thus, the effects observed in F1 fe-
males may be due to their own exposures or to alterations
to the maternal behavior in their mothers, or a combi-
nation of these factors. Furthermore, changes in maternal
behavior (displayed by either F0 or F1 dams) could be
indirect effects (e.g., in response to changes in their
nursing pups). Cross-fostering experiments will be nec-
essary to delineate whether the effects of exposures on the
F1 generation are direct or indirect. However, care must
be taken in study design as maternal behavior can be
affected in both a positive and negative direction by cross-
fostered pups (29, 100–102).
To our knowledge, ours is the first study to examine
whether exposure to one of the current BPA replacement
chemicals, BPS, affects maternal behavior as well as
maternally relevant neural correlates. A growing body of
evidence indicates that exposure to environmental
chemicals can alter maternal behavior [refer to Catanese
et al. (55) and Cummings et al. (93)], and disruptions to
maternal care can profoundly influence the development
of subsequent generations, which are also sensitive
to developmental and environmental impacts (97,
103–106). A combination of neural, endocrine, behav-
ioral, and cognitive processes drives proper maternal
care, allowing mothers to adjust to the needs of the young
over the course of their early development (71, 107–109).
Our results suggest that these processes become impaired
after BPS exposures with differing effects based on dose,
postpartum period, and generational timing of exposure.
The results from our study highlight the need to un-
derstand the effects of xenoestrogens on maternal be-
havior and to better understand the neural mechanisms
underlying these behavioral changes. From an evolu-
tionary perspective, maternal behavior is often defined in
light of its importance for the survival of offspring; the
importance of proper maternal care in humans stems
from its contribution to the physical, emotional, and
psychological development of children, whereas the
negative impact of poor maternal care can last into
adulthood. Therefore, uncovering effects of environ-
mental chemicals that might influence proper maternal
care have broad social and public health implications.
