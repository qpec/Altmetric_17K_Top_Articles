Systemic right-to-left shunts, ischemic
brain lesions, and persistent migraine
activity
ABSTRACT
Objective: To assess whether migraine in the general population is associated with increased risk
of systemic right-to-left shunts (RLS) and whether RLS are associated with increased prevalence
of brain infarcts and persistent recurrence of migraine attacks at older age.
Methods: Brain MRI and transcranial Doppler with air contrast in 166 unselected migraineurs
(mean age 6 SD 56 6 7.7 years; 70% women; n 5 96 migraine with aura) and 69 controls (mean
age 6 SD 55 6 7.6 years; 65% women) from the general population.
Results: Participants with migraine with aura more frequently had Valsalva-induced RLS (60%), in
particular large-sized, compared to controls (42%; odds ratio [OR] 2.1; 95% confidence interval
[CI] 1.1–3.9; p 5 0.02) and participants with migraine without aura (40%; OR 2.3; 95% CI 1.2–
4.3; p 5 0.01). They also more frequently had spontaneous RLS (35%) than participants with
migraine without aura (17%; OR 2.6; 95% CI 1.3–5.6; p 5 0.01) but not compared to controls
(26%; OR 1.6; 95% CI 0.8–3.1; p 5 0.2). Participants with migraine with aura and spontaneous
RLS more frequently had persistent migraine activity (85%) than participants with migraine with-
out spontaneous RLS (63%; OR 3.4; 95% CI 1.2–10.1; p 5 0.03). Nine percent of participants
with RLS had silent posterior circulation infarcts compared to 3% of participants without RLS (OR
2.8; 95% CI 0.9–9.3; p 5 0.08), independent of migraine status. RLS were not associated with
white matter lesions.
Conclusions: RLS are more prevalent in migraineurs with aura but do not explain the increased
prevalence of silent posterior circulation infarcts or white matter lesions in migraineurs. Sponta-
neous RLS are associated with persistent migraine. Neurology® 2016;86:1668–1675

Epidemiologic and animal studies have suggested a complex relation between migraine, ischemic
brain lesions, and systemic right-to-left shunts (RLS).1–6 Participants with migraine had higher
prevalence of subclinical deep white matter hyperintensities and brain infarcts,2,3,5 migraine with
aura was associated with increased prevalence of ischemic stroke1,7 and RLS,4,6 and RLS were more
prevalent in patients with cryptogenic stroke.8,9 In uncontrolled and open-label studies,10–12 but
not in a sham-controlled study,13 closing patent foramen ovale reduced migraine attack frequency
and risk of stroke recurrence.14,15
In mice, carotid injection of small experimental emboli induced cortical spreading depression
(CSD),16,17 the electrophysiologic correlate of migraine aura and a putative trigger for migraine
attacks.18 Altogether, microemboli through RLS might cause cerebral ischemia and might trigger
attacks of migraine with aura. Thus while in most migraineurs attacks cease, recurring sponta-
neously at older age,19 in migraineurs with RLS, attacks might continue recurring. Most of these

 data, however, were obtained in patients from
headache clinics who likely were more severely
affected than the average migraineur. It thus is
uncertain whether and to what extent these
conclusions can be extrapolated to the migrai-
neur at large.
In the present study, we assessed whether
RLS are (1) more prevalent in migraineurs
from the general population, (2) associated
with a higher prevalence of ischemic brain le-
sions on MRI, and (3) associated with ongoing
migraine activity. To this end, we assessed and
correlated (1) presence, type, and size of RLS;
(2) presence and type of ischemic brain le-
sions; and (3) migraine activity, defined as
number of attacks in the preceding year in a
cohort of unselected but well-defined migrai-
neurs (n 5 203) and controls (n 5 83) from
the general population-based Cerebral Abnor-
malities in Migraine: An Epidemiological Risk
Analysis Study Part 2 (CAMERA-2).3 As
CAMERA-2 is a 9-year follow-up of the
CAMERA-1 study,2 in which all migraineurs
were initially diagnosed and characterized, we
could reliably analyze both still active migrai-
neurs in whom attacks were still recurring and
inactive migraineurs in whom attacks had
meanwhile ceased recurring.
METHODS Study population and procedures. Study par-
ticipants were invited from the CAMERA-2 study,3 which was
primarily designed to assess the prevalence, incidence, and
progression
of
MRI-detectable
ischemic
brain
lesions
in
migraineurs over a 9-year follow-period from the CAMERA-1
study.2
In CAMERA-1, 295 well-characterized individuals with
migraine20 and 140 controls who were randomly selected from
a community-based study of the general population were
included and assessed with brain MRI in 2000.2,21 For
CAMERA-2, all original CAMERA-1 participants were invited
in 2009 for a follow-up study, which included a structured
computer-guided telephone interview, brain MRI, physical exam-
ination, and cognitive testing, all similar to the CAMERA-1 pro-
tocols.3 Although MRI scanners had significantly improved over
the follow-up period, we decided to use the same MRI scanners in
CAMERA-2 as in CAMERA-12 to preclude finding changes
solely due to improved technology and sensitivity. Transcranial
Doppler with air contrast (TCD-c) was performed on the same
day as the MRI. MRI and TCD-c were performed and read
without knowledge of migraine status.
Standard protocol approvals, registrations, and patient
consents. The study was approved by the ethics committees and
participants gave written informed consent.
Outcome measures. The primary outcome measure was the
prevalence of RLS in migraineurs with and without aura
compared to controls. Secondary outcome measures were the
prevalence of ongoing recurrence of migraine attacks (defined
as having had at least one migraine attack in the previous 12
months)22 in migraineurs with RLS compared to migraineurs
with migraine but no RLS, and ischemic brain lesions in partic-
ipants with RLS compared to those without.
RLS. Presence of RLS was determined by TCD-c in accor-
dance
with
international
guidelines
and
recent
recom-
mendations.23 Briefly, the right cubital vein was cannulated with
a 20-G indwelling catheter. A microbubble (MB) medium was
prepared by mixing 9 mL saline, 1 mL air, and 0.5 mL of par-
ticipants’ own blood at least 10 times vigorously between 2
syringes connected by a 3-way tap and injected with the partic-
ipant in supine position while insonating the middle cerebral
artery through the temporal bone window. We used a hand-held
2-MHz probe connected to a Doppler system (Multi Dop T2
[DWL, Sipplingen, Germany], Pioneer TC 8080 [Nicolet,
Kleinostheim, Germany], or PMD 100 or ST3 [Spencer Tech-
nologies, Seattle, WA]). Signal recording was commenced 10
seconds before application of the contrast medium and halted
after 60 seconds recording time. The procedure was carried out 3
times in a standardized and fixed order: in the first measurement,
to detect spontaneous RLS, contrast medium was injected during
normal breathing. In the second and third measurement, to
detect RLS after provocation, contrast medium was injected and
followed after 5 seconds by a 5-second Valsalva maneuver. Par-
ticipants were instructed and coached in a standardized way to
press firmly with their mouth closed to produce a Valsalva
maneuver. The procedure was performed by 2 experienced in-
vestigators (H.K. and I.H.P.-M.) blinded for MRI findings and
migraine diagnosis; participants were instructed not to talk about
their medical history. TCD-c investigation was performed
immediately after MRI on the same day.
Offline reading started after completion of the study. Two
experienced observers (R.W.K. and W.H.M.) rated presence
and size category of RLS, blinded to participant characteristics.
Passing MBs were unequivocally characterized acoustically by
the typical chirping sound and visually by the spike-like appear-
ance in the frequency spectrum. RLS were rated according to
number of MBs detected during 60 seconds of each TCD-c inves-
tigation: no RLS (0 MB), small (1–9 MB), or large (.10 MB).
The interrater agreement for presence of RLS was excellent (k 5
0.95; p , 0.001).
MRI. As suggested recently,24 we replaced the previously used
term infarct-like lesions2,3 with silent infarcts. Silent infarcts were
defined as non-mass parenchymal defects with a vascular distri-
bution, isointense to CSF signal on all sequences, and when
supratentorial, surrounded by a hyperintense rim on fluid-
attenuated inversion recovery images.2 Virchow-Robin spaces were
excluded based on typical location, shape, and absence of a hyper-
intense rim.2 In the basal ganglia, in order to exclude nonspecific
lesions, only parenchymal defects larger than 3 mm in diameter were
considered.2 Location and vascular territory of new and preexisting
infarcts were read by 2 experienced neuroradiologists (M.C.K. and
Junya Konishi), who were blinded to diagnosis. The interrater
agreement was excellent (k 5 0.87; p , 0.001).2
White matter lesions were segmented automatically. Deep
white matter hyperintensities were located supratentorial and
not attached to the lateral ventricle.2 High volume of deep white
matter lesions (upper 20th percentile) was used as variable. For
infratentorial hyperintensities, presence vs absence was used.2
Migraine and ongoing recurrence of migraine attacks. Par-
ticipants were asked during a telephone interview whether they
ever had had migraine attacks and, if so, what the average attack

 frequency had been prior to CAMERA-1 and since then. One
participant who was classified as control at CAMERA-1 had
become migraineur without aura during the follow-up period.
Participants who fulfilled the criteria of migraine at CAMERA-1
but had stopped experiencing migraine attacks during last year of
follow-up were considered currently inactive lifetime mi-
graineurs.22 The interview was structured by using personal
benchmarks (e.g., pregnancy) for when a different migraine
pattern had started or stopped.3 These benchmarks were used to
define periods and to compute the average migraine attack fre-
quency (expressed as mean number of attacks per month).

Study population.
Of the 435 original participants of
CAMERA-1, 286 (66%) underwent a follow-up MRI scan
(migraine with aura: n 5 114; migraine without aura: n 5 89;
nonmigraine controls: n 5 83).3 Mean follow-up was 8.5 years
(range 7.9–9.2; SD 0.24 years).3 Of these, 272/286 (95%) agreed
to undergo TCD-c. Usable TCD-c data could be obtained from
235/272 (86%) participants: in 23/272 (8%), no adequate bone
window was found, 9/272 (3%) had no adequate cubital venous

 access, and in 5/272 (2%) offline analysis was not possible due to
technical failures. The 37 participants for whom no usable TCD-
c was available were otherwise comparable to the participants with
usable TCD-c data with respect to age, sex, cardiovascular
history, and migraine status.
As explained before,3 there were no obvious reasons to assume
that there was a serious selection bias from CAMERA-1 to
CAMERA-2, which could have materially affected the results.3
Reasons for nonparticipation were no interest (n 5 51), inability
to visit research center (n 5 30), claustrophobia (n 5 8), and
non-neurologic illness (n 5 6).3 There was no association
between participation rate and diagnosis of migraine. Compared
to nonparticipants, participants were slightly younger, more fre-
quently reported high educational level, and smoked fewer pack-
years.3
Covariates and definitions. Sociodemographic and medical
history characteristics were assessed by telephone interview.3 Car-
diovascular risk diagnoses were based on patient report of a physi-
cian’s diagnosis.3 In women, postmenopausal state was defined as
last menstruation at least 3 months previously or a history of
ovariectomy.
Statistical analysis. Differences in the distributions and
means of characteristics among the study groups were tested
with x2, 2-tailed Fisher exact, unpaired t, and Mann-
Whitney U test when appropriate. The presence of ongoing
migraine attack recurrence was examined by RLS diagnosis
(yes/no)
using
a
model
adjusting
for
age,
sex,
and
postmenopausal state. Likewise, using logistic regression, the
risk of MRI outcomes was examined by RLS diagnosis (yes/
no) and migraine and age as covariates.
Based on findings in previous studies, we decided before-
hand to conduct 3 specific analyses. First, because an
increased prevalence of RLS had only been found for
migraine with aura,4,6 we analyzed the prevalence of RLS
separately for migraine with and without aura. To detect a
difference of 20% in RLS frequency with a power of 0.8 and
a set at 0.05, we would need 162 participants (total number
in 2 arms). Second, because silent infarcts were found
increased only in the posterior cerebral circulation,2 we ana-
lyzed their presence separately for this part of the circulation.
Finally, because higher prevalence of deep white matter le-
sions was only found in women with migraine,3 we con-
ducted

All

statistical tests are shown in text or tables; reported p values
are not corrected for multiple testing as this study was an
exploratory hypothesis-generating study rather than confir-
matory research.
Data were analyzed using Statistical Software Package for
Social Sciences (SPSS version 20.0; IBM, Armonk, NY).
RESULTS Clinical and demographic data of the par-
ticipants are summarized in table 1. Except for dia-
betes, there were no differences between migraineurs
and controls in age, sex, or cardiovascular history.
Table 2 summarizes the prevalence of RLS among
the various study groups. Of the migraineurs with
aura, 60% had RLS vs 42% of controls (unadjusted
odds ratio [OR] 2.1; 95% confidence interval [CI]
1.1–3.9; p 5 0.02) and 40% of migraineurs without
aura (OR 2.3; 95% CI 1.2–4.3; p 5 0.01). Large
RLS were found in 45% of migraineurs with aura
vs 28% of controls (OR 2.1; 95% CI 1.1–4.2; p 5
0.03) and 20% of migraineurs without aura (OR 3.3;
95% CI 1.6–6.6; p 5 0.01). The prevalence of spon-
taneous large RLS was low in migraineurs without
aura (1%) compared to controls (16%) and migrai-
neurs with aura (19%). Otherwise, there were no
differences in the prevalence of spontaneous RLS
among the various groups.
We correlated the presence of total and spontane-
ous RLS with ongoing recurrence of migraine attacks
in the last year as shown in table 3. Migraineurs with
spontaneous RLS more frequently had ongoing recur-
rence of migraine attacks (76%), vs migraineurs with-
out spontaneous RLS (55%) (unadjusted OR 2.6;
95% CI 1.2–5.6; p 5 0.01).
When analyzed separately for migraine with and
without aura, overrepresentation of participants
with migraine with ongoing recurrence of migraine
attacks was only found in migraineurs with aura
and spontaneous RLS (85%) vs without spontane-
ous RLS (63%) (unadjusted OR 3.4; 95% CI 1.2–
10.1; p 5 0.02). These results did not change after
adjusting for age, sex, and postmenopausal state.
Furthermore, migraine inactivity was not due to
higher use of migraine prophylactic agents (data
not shown). Mean attack frequency was not corre-
lated with the presence or absence of spontaneous
RLS (data not shown).

 Table 4 and table e-1 on the Neurology® Web site
at Neurology.org summarize the prevalence of MRI-
detectable brain lesions by RLS type in the 229/235
(97%) participants who underwent TCD-c and for
whom MRI data were available. Prevalence of silent
infarcts in the posterior cerebral circulation in partic-
ipants with RLS (9%) was not different from those
without RLS (3%; OR 2.8; 95% CI 0.9–9.3; p 5
0.08). This was irrespective of migraine status (data
not shown).
The risk of posterior circulation silent infarcts was
further assessed using a multivariate regression model
(with migraine presence, RLS presence, and age as co-
variates). Higher age (p 5 0.004) and possibly RLS
(p 5 0.08), but not migraine (p 5 0.7), were associ-
ated with an increased infarct risk. No significant asso-
ciations were found between RLS (subtypes) and deep
white matter lesions, also not when stratified for sex.
DISCUSSION We assessed and correlated (1) pres-
ence, type, and size of RLS, (2) presence and type
of ischemic brain lesions on MRI, and (3) persistent
migraine activity in a large and unbiased general
population-based cohort of phenotypically well-
characterized migraineurs and controls. We found,
first, that in particular large-sized RLS are more
prevalent among migraineurs with aura but not in
migraineurs without aura. Second, migraineurs with
aura and spontaneous RLS more often had ongoing
migraine activity compared to migraineurs with
aura without RLS or migraineurs without aura with
or without RLS. Third, participants with RLS did
not have more silent infarcts in the posterior
cerebral circulation, irrespective of whether or not
they also had migraine. There was no association of
RLS with white matter lesions.
Our finding that RLS are more prevalent in mi-
graineurs with aura from the general population is
well in line with observations from clinic-based stud-
ies4,6 and extends the RLS-migraine association from
selected severe cases who are attending headache clin-
ics to the average patient with migraine with aura.
Two previous population-based studies, however,
failed to find an association between RLS and
migraine,25,26 most likely due to limited statistical
power, use of detection methods with only limited
sensitivity to identify RLS, and, possibly, selection
bias. In the first study,25 79% of participants had

 migraine with aura, whereas in the general population
only one third of migraineurs have migraine with
aura.21 Moreover, in that study, transthoracic echo
was used, which is known to have a lower sensitivity
to detect RLS compared to TCD-c.27 The second
study26 most likely was underpowered, with only 42
participants with migraine with aura and 44 with
migraine without aura. Moreover, RLS might have
been missed in many participants as the TCD signal
was assessed within 10 seconds after injection of con-
trast, which generally is considered too soon.28 Use of
TCD-c, which is more sensitive to detect RLS than
the other methods generally used,27 and the longer
time window (60 seconds), which increases the chan-
ces of detecting very small cardiac shunts, may explain
why we found somewhat higher RLS prevalences
than were found in other studies.4,6,25,26 Two clinic-
based studies29,30 assessed RLS with TCD-c in
chronic (high frequent) migraine but with inconsis-
tent findings: 66%30 vs 37%.29 Control groups such
as participants with episodic migraine or participants
without migraine were lacking in both studies.
The relationship between RLS and migraine with
aura is intriguing and might be explained at least in
part by shared genetic factors.31 Alternatively, there
might be a direct causal relationship.32 In mice, it was
shown that carotid injection of small particles or air
emboli injected could evoke CSD,16 the electrophys-
iologic correlate of migraine aura and a putative trig-
ger for migraine attacks.18 Migraineurs who were
injected with agitated saline developed EEG altera-
tions and headache attacks, particularly those with
large RLS.17 Finally, in a small open-label study,
87% of migraine patients with RLS had a 50% or
greater reduction in migraine frequency when using
the emboli-preventing drug clopidogrel.33 It has also
been hypothesized that substances like amines and
other chemicals might bypass the pulmonary filter
in participants with RLS, precipitating migraine at-
tacks in susceptible individuals.11 A direct relation-
ship between RLS and migraine in at least some
people is further suggested by our finding that partic-
ipants with migraine with aura (but not those without
aura) more often had ongoing migraine activity if
they also had spontaneous RLS. As TCD cannot dis-
tinguish between cardiac and pulmonary RLS, we
cannot determine which type is most relevant in
migraine. Trials testing the migraine attack-reducing
effect of closing patent foramen ovale (PFO), the
most frequent cause of RLS,11 traditionally included
participants with both migraine with and without
aura, and participants with Valsalva-induced rather
than spontaneous PFO.10–13 Whereas retrospective
studies10–12 showed promising results, a prospective,
randomized, sham-controlled trial13 failed to show
any effect. Interestingly, preliminary results of the
open-label but randomized Percutaneous Closure of
PFO in Migraine with Aura (PRIMA) trial compar-
ing PFO closure with antimigraine medication sug-
gested selective elimination of attacks of migraine
with aura in participants in whom large spontaneous
PFOs had been closed (presented at the Transcatheter
Cardiovascular Therapeutics Meeting, Washington,
DC, September 2014).
Presence of RLS was not associated with higher
prevalence of silent infarcts in the posterior circula-
tion; this is in line with studies reporting that RLS
is not associated with specific ischemic patterns.34
Furthermore, there was no association of RLS with
deep white matter hyperintensities or infratentorial
hyperintensities,
which
is
in
line
with
other
studies.35,36
The design and study population of the present
study allow for a broad extrapolation of the results
to the average migraine patient. Although still too
small for additional subgroup analyses, the study
sample should be considered large in view of the
fact that all participants had brain MRI. Moreover,
the study participants were drawn from a pheno-
typically well-defined, general population-based,
long-term follow-up study,20,37 and their clinical
characteristics covered a wide range of disease se-
verities and attack frequencies. The fact that even
patients were included in whom attacks had ceased
recurring enabled reliable analysis of the relation-
ship between RLS and persistent migraine activity
at older age. Compared to methods used in most
other studies, TCD-c, although less specific for
subtype, is more sensitive for detecting RLS.
Finally, both TCD-c and MRI were performed
and interpreted by investigators who were strictly
blinded to the clinical diagnoses and characteristics
of the participants.
Migraine with aura, but not without aura, is asso-
ciated with increased prevalence of in particular large
RLS. Spontaneous, but not Valsalva-induced, RLS
are associated with persistent recurrence of migraine
attacks beyond the age most patients normally cease
having attacks. Finally, RLS were not associated with
increased risk of ischemic brain lesions, irrespective of
comorbid migraine status.
