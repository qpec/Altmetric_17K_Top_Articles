Abstract
Plasma androgen receptor (AR) gain identifies metastatic castration-resistant prostate
cancer (mCRPC) patients with worse outcome on abiraterone/enzalutamide, but its
relevance in the context of taxane chemotherapy is unknown. We aimed to evaluate
whether docetaxel is active regardless of plasma AR and to perform an exploratory
analysis to compare docetaxel with abiraterone/enzalutamide. This multi-institutional
study was a pooled analysis of AR status, determined by droplet digital polymerase chain
reaction, on pretreatment plasma samples. We evaluated associations between plasma
AR and overall/progression-free survival (OS/PFS) and prostate-specific antigen (PSA)
response rate in 163 docetaxel-treated patients. OS was significantly shorter in case of AR
gain (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.61, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.08–2.39, p = 0.018), but
not PFS (HR = 1.04, 95% CI 0.74–1.46, p = 0.8) or PSA response (odds ratio = 1.14, 95%
CI = 0.65–1.99, p = 0.7). We investigated the interaction between plasma AR and treat-
ment type after incorporating updated data from our prior study of 73 chemotherapy-

 There
are
currently
several
approved
life-prolonging
therapies for the
treatment of
metastatic castration-
resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), including androgen
receptor (AR)-directed drugs and taxanes. Plasma DNA
analysis from mCRPC patients has suggested potential
clinical applicability with an association between plasma AR
aberrations and worse outcome with AR-directed drugs [1–
5]. To date, detection of AR splice variants has been shown
to have potential utility for the selection of taxane versus
AR-targeted therapy for patients with mCRPC [6,7]. Howev-
er, the relevance of plasma AR status in the context of
taxanes is unknown.
We here aimed to evaluate the association of plasma AR
status with outcomes in mCRPC patients treated with
docetaxel. Additionally, we aimed to perform an explorato-
ry analysis to compare the difference in outcome by plasma
AR status for patients treated either with first-line docetaxel
or AR-directed therapy.
Plasma samples were collected, with the primary aim of
biomarker evaluation, from mCRPC patients, treated with
standard-dose intravenous docetaxel 75 mg/m2 every 3 wk
with prednisone 5 mg twice daily for a maximum of
10 cycles for mCRPC [8], between May 2011 and January
2017 in 20 institutions. For the exploratory analysis, we
included data on patients from our previous publication [5]
who received abiraterone/enzalutamide prior to chemo-
therapy at the development of mCRPC, with updated clinical
follow-up with a cut-off date of December 2017. All patients
provided signed consent to an institutional review board-
approved protocol before sample collection. Selection
criteria, procedures, and the AR copy number (CN) droplet
digital polymerase chain reaction assay are described in the
Supplementary material.
We set out to determine AR status in plasma collected
from 166 docetaxel-treated mCRPC patients prior to first- or
second-line mCRPC therapy (Fig. 1A), but we had sample
failure in three cases. We detected plasma AR gain in
50 patients (31%; 28% AR gain prior to first-line and 37%
prior to second-line therapy). The median number of
docetaxel cycles was the same in AR-normal and AR-gained
patients (median 8, interquartile range 6–10). The median
follow-up period of alive patients was 24 mo. As 98% of the
deaths were prostate cancer related, only overall survival
(OS), and not cancer-specific survival, was analyzed. The
median OS was 14 mo (95% confidence interval [CI] 12–23)
for AR-gained patients and 22 mo (95% CI 20–29) for AR-
normal patients. Median progression-free survival (PFS)
was 7 mo (95% CI 5–8) in AR-gained patients and 7 mo (95%
CI 6–8) in AR-normal patients. OS was significantly shorter
in AR-gained versus AR-normal patients (hazard ratio [HR]
= 1.61, 95% CI 1.08–2.39, p = 0.02), but no significant
difference was observed for PFS (HR = 1.04, 95% CI 0.74–
1.46,p = 0.8) or prostate-specific antigen (PSA) decline �50%
(odds ratio = 1.14, 95% CI 0.65–1.99, p = 0.7; Fig. 1B–D).
Next, we selected the 115 patients treated with docetaxel
as
first-line
therapy
and
in
an
exploratory,
analysis
compared them with 73 previously described patients
treated with first-line abiraterone/enzalutamide (Fig. 1A)
[5]. A comparison of clinicopathological characteristics
between patients receiving either docetaxel or abiraterone/
enzalutamide
as
first-line
therapy
showed
significant
differences in age, site of metastases, PSA, lactate dehydro-
genase
(LDH),
hemoglobin,
alkaline phosphatase,
and
plasma AR status (Supplementary Table 1). When compar-
ing AR-normal with AR-gained patients in each treatment
group, serum LDH and PSA were significantly higher in AR-
gained patients treated with abiraterone/enzalutamide and
serum alkaline phosphatase was significantly higher in
plasma AR-gained patients treated with docetaxel (Supple-
mentary Table 2).
The interaction of docetaxel or abiraterone/enzaluta-
mide therapy and AR status was investigated using a
multivariable
Cox
proportional
hazard
model,
which
showed a significant treatment interaction with AR status
for both OS (HR = 0.16, 95% CI 0.06–0.46, p < 0.001) and PFS
(HR = 0.31,
95%
CI
0.12–0.80,
p = 0.02;
Supplementary
Table 3). The median follow-up period for alive patients
of the abiraterone/enzalutamide cohort was 32 mo.
The estimated median OS and PFS as a function of
treatment and AR CN status are depicted in Figures 2A and
naïve, abiraterone/enzalutamide-treated patients, with data from 115 first-line doce-
taxel patients. In an exploratory analysis of mCRPC patients receiving first-line thera-
pies, a significant interaction was observed between plasma AR and docetaxel versus
abiraterone/enzalutamide for OS (HR = 0.16, 95% CI = 0.06–0.46, p < 0.001) and PFS
(HR = 0.31, 95% CI = 0.12–0.80, p = 0.02). Specifically, we reported a significant difference
for OS favoring abiraterone/enzalutamide for AR-normal patients (HR = 1.93, 95%
CI = 1.19–3.12, p = 0.008) and a suggestion favoring docetaxel for AR-gained patients
(HR = 0.53, 95% CI = 0.24–1.16, p = 0.11). These data suggest that AR-normal patients
should receive abiraterone/enzalutamide and AR-gained could benefit from docetaxel.
This treatment selection merits prospective evaluation in a randomized trial.
Patient summary: We investigated whether plasma androgen receptor (AR) predicted
outcome in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) patients treated
with docetaxel, and we performed an exploratory analysis in patients treated with
docetaxel or AR-directed drugs as first-line mCRPC therapy. We showed that plasma AR
normal favored hormonal treatment, whilst plasma AR-gained patients may have had a
longer response to docetaxel, suggesting that plasma AR status could be a useful
treatment selection biomarker.

 2B, respectively. The HRs for OS (Fig. 2C) and PFS (Fig. 2D)
estimated from the Cox proportional hazard regression
analyses suggested that AR-normal patients treated with
abiraterone/enzalutamide had a significantly lower risk of
death (HR = 1.93, 95% CI 1.19–3.12, p = 0.008) and progres-
sive disease (HR = 2.60, 95% CI 1.75–3.86, p < 0.001) when
compared with those treated with docetaxel, and in AR-
gained patients there was a suggestion toward a lower risk
of death (HR = 0.53, 95% CI 0.24–1.16, p = 0.11; Fig. 2C) and

Metastatic CRPC patients can be treated with docetaxel
or AR-targeting therapies as first-line therapy. We and
others have reported that detection of circulating AR
aberrations is associated with worse outcome on abirater-
one/enzalutamide [2–5]. In this study, we report that
plasma AR gain in docetaxel-treated patients was associated
with significantly shorter OS. This emphasizes the urgent
clinical
need
of
alternative treatments for
AR-gained
patients [9]. Retrospective studies have suggested that

 AR-V7 expression in mCRPC men can be considered a
treatment-specific
biomarker associated with
superior
survival for taxane therapy compared with AR therapies
[6,7]. Here, we explored whether plasma AR gain status is
associated with resistance to taxanes in an abiraterone/
enzalutamide-naïve population and, to avoid the influence
of possible cross-resistance events on the interpretation of
survival data, we compared it with the effect seen in taxane-
naïve abiraterone/enzalutamide-treated patients [10]. The
absence of a difference in outcome by AR status in
treatment-naïve docetaxel-treated patients introduces the
hypothesis that AR-gained patients would derive greater
benefit from treatment with taxanes in preference to
abiraterone/enzalutamide. However, we recognize some
limitations of our study, including the significantly different
durations of median follow-up of alive patients between the
docetaxel and the abiraterone/enzalutamide cohort (24 vs
32 mo, with overall follow-up of 24 mo); the relatively
modest sample size of the cohorts, especially of AR-gained
patients treated with abiraterone/enzalutamide (n = 10);
and the retrospective, nonrandomized design. The majority
of patients were treated with taxanes in centers when
abiraterone or enzalutamide were not widely available prior
to chemotherapy. Nonetheless, there could be a bias due to
patient selection, given the different toxicity profiles of
taxanes compared with AR-targeting drugs. Additionally,
detection of an AR-gained clone may be more likely at
higher circulating tumor fraction that in itself is prognostic;
this could bias the ability to ascertain the predictive value of
plasma AR with AR-targeting drugs but would not change
the interpretation of the absence of difference in our
treatment-naive taxane-treated cohort. Lastly, we only
considered AR gain, but other concurrently assessed AR
aberrations (somatic point mutations or splice variants)
could provide additional or overlapping information. Our
findings suggest that AR gain detected in plasma is
associated with resistance to abiraterone/enzalutamide
but not with taxanes when used in the first-line setting.
In conclusion, prospective randomized trials are warranted
to validate the utility of plasma AR status for treatment
selection in mCRPC patients.
