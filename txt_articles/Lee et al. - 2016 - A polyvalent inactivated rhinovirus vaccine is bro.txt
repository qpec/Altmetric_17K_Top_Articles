As the predominant aetiological agent of the common cold, human rhinovirus (HRV) is
the leading cause of human infectious disease. Early studies showed that a monovalent
formalin-inactivated HRV vaccine can be protective, and virus-neutralizing antibodies (nAb)
correlated with protection. However, co-circulation of many HRV types discouraged further
vaccine efforts. Here, we test the hypothesis that increasing virus input titres in polyvalent
inactivated HRV vaccine may result in broad nAb responses. We show that serum nAb
against many rhinovirus types can be induced by polyvalent, inactivated HRVs plus alhydrogel
(alum) adjuvant. Using formulations up to 25-valent in mice and 50-valent in rhesus
macaques, HRV vaccine immunogenicity was related to sufficient quantity of input antigens,
and valency was not a major factor for potency or breadth of the response. Thus, we have
generated a vaccine capable of inducing nAb responses to numerous and diverse HRV types.

RV causes respiratory illness in billions of people
annually, a socio-economic burden1. HRV also causes
pneumonia hospitalizations in children and adults, and
exacerbations of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease (COPD)2. HRV was found to be the second leading
cause of community-acquired pneumonia requiring hospitalization
in US children, second only to respiratory syncytial virus,
and the most common pathogen associated with pneumonia
hospitalization in US adults3,4. A vaccine for HRV could alleviate
serious
disease
in asthma
and
COPD,
reduce
pneumonia
hospitalizations and have widespread benefits for society on the
whole. Decades ago, researchers identified inactivated HRV as a
protective vaccine, defined virus-neutralizing antibodies (nAb) as a
correlate of protection, and estimated duration of immunity5–11.
Trials with monovalent HRV vaccine demonstrated that protection
from
homologous
challenge
and
disease
can
be
achieved
with formalin-inactivated virus given intramuscularly (i.m.) or
intranasally8,10,11. Humoral immunity to heterologous virus types
was not observed, though cross-reactive CD8 T cells can promote
clearance12,13.
Limited
cross-neutralizing
antibodies
can
be
induced by hyper-immunization in animals14,15. The possibility
of a vaccine composed of 50, 100 or more distinct HRV antigens
has been viewed as formidable or impossible2,16,17. There are two
main challenges, generating a broad immune response and the
feasibility of composing such a vaccine. The Ab repertoire is
theoretically immense, and most vaccines in clinical use are
thought to work via a polyclonal Ab response. Deep-sequencing of
human Ab genes following vaccination against influenza virus
found thousands of Ab lineages18,19. Whole pathogen and
polyvalent vaccines carrying natural immunogens take advantage
of this capacity. Valency has increased for pneumococcal and
human papillomavirus virus vaccines in recent years. Given the
significance of HRV, we tested polyvalent HRV vaccines.
There are three species of HRV, A, B and C. Sequencing
methods define 83 A types, 32 B types and 55 C types20,21. It is
thought there are 150–170 serologically distinct HRV types.
HRV A and C are associated with asthma exacerbations and with
more acute disease than HRV B22,23. HRV C was discovered in
2006 and 2007 (refs 24–27) and recently cultured in cells28,29.
Here, we focused on HRV A, the most prevalent species. There
are no permissive animal challenge models of HRV virus
replication, but mice and cotton rats can recapitulate aspects of
HRV pathogenesis30,31. The best efficacy model is human
challenge. In monovalent vaccine trials, formalin-inactivated
HRV-13 was validated before clinical testing by assessing
induction of nAb in guinea pigs, and a reciprocal serum nAb
titre of 23 resulting from four doses of a 1:125 dilution of the
vaccine correlated with vaccine efficacy in humans9. Although
the nAb titre required for protection is not defined, early studies
established inactivated HRV as protective in humans, and
immunogenicity in animals informed clinical testing.
Here, we show that polyvalent inactivated HRV vaccines
generate broad nAb responses in a BALB/c mouse model
(up to 25-valent) as well as a rhesus macaque (RM) model
(up to 50-valent). Immunogenicity of polyvalent inactivated HRV
vaccines is not affected by increasing valency, and it relates to
antigen dose. A highly polyvalent strategy may facilitate practical
HRV vaccine development.
Results
Immunogenicity of 10-valent HRV vaccine in mice. We first
used BALB/c mice to test immunogenicity. We propagated HRVs
in H1-HeLa cells and inactivated infectivity using formalin. Sera
from naive mice had no detectable nAb against HRV-16 (Fig. 1).
Alum adjuvant enhanced the nAb response induced by i.m.
inactivated HRV-16 (Fig. 1). There was no effect of valency
(comparing 1-, 3-, 5-, 7- and 10-valent) on the nAb response
induced by inactivated HRV-16 or to the 3 types in the 3-valent
vaccine (HRV-16, HRV-36 and HRV-78; Fig. 1). The 50% tissue
culture infectious dose (TCID50) titres of the input viruses before
inactivation (inactivated-TCID50) are provided in Supplementary
Table 1. Original antigenic sin can occur when sequential
exposure to related virus variants results in biased immunity to
the type encountered first32. In bivalent HRV-immune mice,
we observed modest original antigenic sin following prime
vaccination
with
10-valent
inactivated
HRV,
and
boost
vaccination partially alleviated the effect (Supplementary Fig. 1),
similar
to
influenza
virus32.
Collectively,
these
results
prompted us to explore more fully the nAb response to
polyvalent HRV vaccine.
Sufficient input HRV titre determines immunogenicity. In
1975, it was reported that two different 10-valent inactivated
HRV preparations induced nAb titres to only 30–40% of the
input virus types in recipient subjects33. However, the input titres
of viruses before inactivation ranged from 101.5 to 105.5 TCID50
per ml, and these were then diluted 10-fold to generate 10-valent
1.0 ml doses given i.m. as prime and boost with no adjuvant33.
We hypothesized that low input antigen doses are responsible

 for poor nAb responses to 10-valent inactivated HRV. We
reconstituted the 1975 10-valent vaccine, as closely as possible
with available HRV types, over a 101 to 105 inactivated-TCID50
per vaccine dose, and we compared it with a 10-valent vaccine of
the same types with input titres ranging from4105 to4107
inactivated-TCID50 per dose. The reconstituted 1975 vaccine
resulted in no detectable nAb after prime vaccination and,
following boost vaccination, nAb to the five types that had the
highest input titres (Fig. 2). The high titre vaccine resulted in nAb
to 5 of 10 types after prime vaccination and all 10 types after
the boost (Fig. 2). Following the boost vaccinations, there
appeared to be a 104 inactivated-TCID50 per vaccine dose
threshold for the induction of nAb in this model (Fig. 2b).
Above this titre, there was no correlation between input load and
nAb induction.
Immunogenicity of 25-valent HRV vaccine in mice. Injectable
vaccines used in people are commonly given in a 0.5 ml dose.
In our facility, the highest allowable i.m. vaccine volume in
mice was 0.1 ml. We tested a 25-valent per 0.1 ml HRV vaccine in
mice as a scalable prototype. The 25-valent inactivated HRV
vaccine had a 7.4-fold lower average inactivated-TCID50 per type
per dose than the 10-valent composition (Supplementary Table 2)
to
accommodate
the
volume
adjustment.
The
10-valent
inactivated HRV vaccine induced nAb to 100% of input types
following the prime and the boost (Fig. 3a). The nAb induced by
10-valent inactivated HRV were persisting at 203 days post-boost
(Supplementary Fig. 2). We used two different sets of virus stocks
for the prime and boost 25-valent vaccinations in these
experiments (Supplementary Table 2). The reason is that in the
interim between the prime and boost vaccinations, we obtained
higher titre virus stocks of eleven of the input types (HRV-32, -49,
-58, -55, -41, -33, -39, -50, -1B, -21 and -60). The higher
titre stocks of these eleven were used in the boost vaccination.
The 25-valent inactivated HRV prime vaccination induced nAb
to 18 of 25 (72%) virus types, and the 25-valent boost resulted in
nAb against 24 of the 25 types (96%; Fig. 3b). The average nAb
titre resulting from prime and boost was 27 for 10-valent and 26.8
for 25-valent. These data demonstrate broad neutralization of
diverse HRV types with a straightforward vaccine approach.

Figure 2 | Immunogenicity of inactivated polyvalent HRV is related to
dose. Mice (2 groups, 20 per group) were vaccinated with 10-valent HRV
vaccine consisting of low inactivated-TCID50 per dose input titres (x-axis),
similar to the 1975 Hamory et al. study33, plus alum (magenta open circles)
or with 10-valent HRV vaccine with high inactivated-TCID50 per dose input
titres plus alum (blue open squares). Sera were collected 18 days after
prime (a) and 18 days after boost (b), pooled for each group and nAb titres
(y-axis) were measured against the indicated types in the vaccines. The
dashed line represents LOD. Undetectable nAb were assigned LOD/2, and
some symbols below LOD were nudged for visualization. Three
independent experiments using low input titres showed similar results.
There was a statistically significant association between input TCID50 virus
titre and a detectable nAb response following prime (P ¼ 0.01) and boost
(P ¼ 0.03) vaccination (Fisher’s exact test).

 Immunogenicity of 25- and 50-valent HRV in RMs. To increase
vaccine valency, we chose RMs and a 1.0 ml i.m. vaccine volume.
Two RMs were vaccinated with 25-valent inactivated HRV, and
two RMs were vaccinated with 50-valent inactivated HRV.
Pre-immune sera in RM A and RM B had no detectable nAb
against the 25 HRV types included in the 25-valent vaccine. The
inactivated-TCID50 titres per dose were higher in RMs than in
mice (Supplementary Table 3). The 25-valent vaccine induced nAb
to 96% (RM A) and 100% (RM B) of input viruses following the
prime vaccination (Fig. 4a). The 50-valent vaccine induced nAb to
90% (RM C) and 82% (RM D) of input viruses following the prime
vaccination (Fig. 4c). The breadth of nAb following prime
vaccination in RM was superior to what we observed in mice,
which may have been due to animal species differences and/or
higher inactivated-TCID50 input titres in the RM vaccines.
Following boost vaccination, there were serum nAb titres against
100% of the types in 25-valent HRV-vaccinated RMs (Fig. 4b) and
98% (49 out of 50) of the virus types in 50-valent HRV-vaccinated
RMs (Fig. 4d). The average nAb titre resulting from prime and
boost in RMs was 29.3 for 25-valent and 28.6 for 50-valent. The
nAb responses were type-specific, not cross-neutralizing, because
there were minimal nAbs induced by the 25-valent vaccine against
10 non-vaccine types (Supplementary Fig. 3). The nAb response to
50-valent inactivated HRV vaccine was broad and potent in RMs.
HRV yield in WI-38 cells and semi-purification by HPLC. The
HRV stocks used in our vaccinations were produced in H1-HeLa
cells, a good substrate for HRV replication but not suitable for
vaccine manufacturing. We compared the infectious yield of 10
HRV types in H1-HeLa and WI-38, which can be qualified for
vaccine production. Adequate yields were obtained from WI-38
cells
(Supplementary
Fig.
4).
Injectable
vaccines
require
defined purity. As proof of principle, we semi-purified three
HRV types by high-performance liquid chromatography and
found uncompromised immunogenicity of trivalent inactivated
semi-purified HRV in mice (Supplementary Fig. 5).
Discussion
In this study, we demonstrate that polyvalent inactivated
HRV vaccine expanded to a 50-valent composition, with alum
adjuvant, is immunogenic against approximately one-third of
circulating HRV types. Although fifty HRV types is a minority,
these data provide proof of principle for a highly polyvalent
vaccine approach. Forty years ago, the prospects for a polyvalent
HRV vaccine were dour for good reasons17. However, progress in
technology34 and advancement of more complex vaccines renders
impediments to a polyvalent HRV vaccine manageable. Scale-up
of HRV vaccines may be facilitated by related vaccine production
processes and new cost-saving manufacturing technologies35–37.
Inactivated HRV has a positive history of clinical efficacy6,8,9.
On the basis of our results and doses of early immunogenic
HRV vaccines6,8, we estimate 104–5 inactivated-TCID50 per type
per dose will be useful. Therefore, HRV stock titresZ107 TCID50
per ml are required for a potential 83-valent HRV A formulation
in a 0.5 ml dose containing alum adjuvant. In future studies, we
hope to produce a comprehensive 83-valent HRV A vaccine.
A limitation of our study is that we have not included HRV C
antigens, which will be important for HRV vaccine development,
especially for paediatric populations. Ongoing efforts are aimed
at propagation of HRV C strains to high titre in cell lines
and development of serology assays. Ultimately, our approach
may lead to vaccines for rhinovirus-mediated diseases including
asthma and COPD exacerbations and the common cold.
Advancing valency may be applicable to vaccines for other
antigenically variable pathogens.
Methods
Cell lines and viruses. H1-HeLa (CRL-1958) and WI-38 (CCL-75) cells were
obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and cultured in
minimal essential media with Richter’s modification and no phenol red (MEM)
(Thermo Fisher) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. The cell lines
were not authenticated but are not commonly misidentified (International Cell
Line Authentication Committee). We tested HeLa-H1 cells using the LookOut
Mycoplasma detection kit (Sigma), and these were mycoplasma negative. HRV-7

prototype strains were purchased from ATCC. HRV-1B, HRV-10, HRV-21,
HRV-28, HRV-33, HRV-34, HRV-39, HRV-45, HRV-50, HRV-51, HRV-54,
HRV-55 and HRV-94 strains were obtained from the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention. The HRVs in the study are species A, with the exception
of HRV-14 (B), and represent A species broadly20,21.
HRV propagation and titration. HRV stocks were generated in H1-HeLa cells.
Approximately 0.5 ml of HRV was inoculated onto subconfluent H1-HeLa
monolayer cells in a T-182 flask. After adsorption for 1 h at room temperature with
rocking, 50 ml of HRV infection medium (MEM supplemented with 2% FBS,
20 mM HEPES, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 � non-essential amino acids (Gibco catalog
11140-050)) was added and the infection was allowed to proceed at 32 �C in a 5%
CO2 humidified incubator until the monolayer appeared to be completely involved
with cytopathic effect (CPE), 1 to 3 days post-infection. The cells were scraped, and
the cells and medium (B50 ml) were transferred to two pre-chilled 50 ml conical
polypropylene tubes and kept on ice while each suspension was sonicated using a
Sonic Dismembrator Model 500 (Fisher Scientific) equipped with a ½-inch dia-
meter horn disrupter and 1/4-inch diameter tapered microtip secured on a ring
stand. Sonication was performed by an operator in a closed room with ear pro-
tection, at 10% amplitude, 1 s on/1 s off intervals and 1 pulse per 1 ml of material.
Sonication yielded higher titres than freeze–thaw. The suspension was clarified by
centrifugation at 931g for 10 min. The supernatant was transferred to cryovials,
snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at � 80 �C. For comparing HRV yield in
H1-HeLa and WI-38 cells, T-75 flasks of subconfluent cells were infected at a
multiplicity of infection of 0.1 TCID50 per cell, and 20 ml of culture medium were
discarded before scraping the cells in the remaining 5 ml followed by sonication.
For all stocks, TCID50 ml � 1 titres were determined by infecting subconfluent
H1-HeLa cells in 96-well plates with serially diluted samples, staining the cells 6
days post-infection with 0.1% crystal violet/20% methanol, scoring wells for CPE
and calculating the end point titre using the Reed and Muench method38.
HRV purification. HRV stock was collected from H1-HeLa cell monolayers as
described above and clarified by brief centrifugation at low speed to remove large
cellular debris (931g, 10min, 4 �C). To remove excess albumin from the crude virus
stock by affinity chromatography, the supernatant was loaded onto a HiTrap Blue
HP column (GE Healthcare) using an A
¨KTA Purifier system (GE Healthcare)
according to the manufacturer specifications. Flowthrough was subsequently
loaded through a HiTrap Capto Core 700 column (GE Healthcare) to refine the virus
prep by size exclusion chromatography. The flowthrough from the HiTrap Blue HP
and the HiTrap Capto Core 700 was captured using the A
¨KTA Purifier system
(GE Healthcare) with a 20mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0). Flowthrough
from size exclusion chromatography was dialyzed overnight with 0.1M Tris-HCl
buffer (pH 8.0), then loaded onto a HiTrap Q XL column (GE Healthcare) and
separated into fractions by ion exchange chromatography. Virus-containing
fractions were eluted using the A
¨KTA Purifier system (GE Healthcare) with a 0.1 M
Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) and a sodium chloride gradient. Fractions showing high
absorption peaks at 280 nM were collected and analysed for viral titre by TCID50 end
point dilution assay, and fraction purity visualized on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel by silver
stain (Thermo Fisher Scientific; Supplementary Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table 4).
Fractions of HRV-16, HRV-36 and HRV-78 of high virus titre and purity were
combined for formalin inactivation as described below.
Mice and RMs. All experiments involving animals were performed at Emory Uni-
versity and the Yerkes National Primate Research Center in accordance with guide-
lines established by the Animal Welfare Act and the NIH Guide for the
Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Animal facilities at Emory University and
the Yerkes Center are fully accredited by the Association for Assessment and
Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International (AAALAC). The Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of Emory University approved these
studies. Pathogen-free, 6–7-week female BALB/c mice were purchased from the
Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME, USA). Mice were randomly assigned to groups
based on the sequential selection from an inventory, and investigators were not

Figure 4 | Broad nAb responses against 25-valent and 50-valent inactivated HRV in RMs. The inactivated-TCID50 input titres per dose are specified in
Supplementary Table 3. Two RMs (RM A and RM B) were vaccinated i.m. with 25-valent HRV and alum (a,b), and two RMs (RM C and RM D) were
vaccinated i.m. with 50-valent HRV and alum (c,d). nAb titres against input virus types were measured in individual serum samples collected at day 18
(a,c). The RM received an identical boost vaccination at day 28, and sera were collected at day 46 for determining nAb titres post-boost vaccination
(b,d). Error bars depict 95% confidence interval. The dashed line represents LOD. Undetectable nAb were assigned LOD/2.

 blinded to outcome assessment. No statistical methods were used in predetermining
sample sizes.
Young adult (3–5 kg, 2–4 years of age, 2 females and 2 males) Indian RMs
(Macaca mulatta; RM) were maintained according to NIH guidelines at the Yerkes
National Primate Research Center. Handling and movement of RMs was
performed by qualified personnel who have received specific training in safe and
humane methods of animal handling at the Yerkes National Primate Research
Center. The initial exclusion criterion was pre-existing nAb against HRV. The
studies were performed in strict accordance with US Department of Agriculture
regulations and the recommendations in the Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory
Animals of the NIH. The RMs were allocated in an un-blinded manner to two
vaccine groups (25-valent and 50-valent), one male and one female per group. No
statistical methods were used in predetermining sample sizes.
Vaccination. Before immunization, all HRV types were inactivated by addition of
0.025% formalin followed by incubation with stirring for 72 h at 37 �C, as
previously described for HRV vaccine33. Complete inactivation of infectivity was
confirmed by end point TCID50 titration in H1-HeLa cells. Formalin inactivation
by this method resulted in greater immunogenicity in mice than alternative
inactivation by b-propiolactone, suggesting formalin inactivation preserved
antigenic determinants. Mice were vaccinated i.m. with inactivated HRV strains
mixed with 100 mg of Alhydrogel adjuvant 2% (aluminium hydroxide wet gel
suspension, alum; Sigma catalog A8222 or Invivogen catalog vac-alu) according to
instructions of the manufacturers. The total volume per mouse was 100 ml,
administered in 50 ml per thigh. Mice were given a second identical vaccination
(boost) at the time indicated in figure legends. RMs were vaccinated i.m. with
inactivated HRV strains mixed with 500 mg of Alhydrogel adjuvant 2%. The total
volume per RM was 1 ml, administered in one leg. RMs were boosted with an
identical vaccination at four weeks.
Serum collection. In mice, peripheral blood was collected into microcentrifuge
tubes from the submandibular vein. Samples were incubated at room temperature
for 20 min to clot. The tubes were centrifuged 7,500g for 10 min to separate serum.
The serum samples were pooled from mice of each group and stored at � 80 �C
until used. Phlebotomy involving RMs was performed under either ketamine
(10 mg kg � 1) or Telazol (4 mg kg � 1) anaesthesia on fasting animals. Following
anaesthesia with ketamine or Telazol, the animals were bled from the femoral vein.
Yerkes blood collection guidelines were followed and no more than 10 ml kg � 1 per
28 days of blood was collected. After collecting blood in serum separating tube,
samples were incubated at room temperature for 30 min. The tubes were cen-
trifuged at 2,500g for 15 min to separate serum. The serum samples from individual
RM were stored at � 80 �C until used.
Serum neutralization assay. H1-HeLa cells were seeded in 96-well plates to attain
80–90% confluence in 24 h. Due to the limited volume of mouse serum per bleed
and the number of nAb assays required, we pooled mouse sera. After separating
serum from whole blood, equal volumes of sera per mouse were pooled from each
group, before heat inactivation. Levels of nAb against the indicated HRV types in
the vaccines used in mice were measured in pooled sera. Heat-inactivated (56 �C,
30 min) serum samples were twofold serially diluted in MEM and added to 500
TCID50 ml � 1 HRV of each type to be tested, in an equal volume. The virus and
serum mixtures were incubated at 37 �C for 1 h. Then, 50 ml of the serum–virus
mixture was transferred onto H1-HeLa cell monolayers in 96-well plates in
triplicate, and plates were spinoculated at 2,095g for 30 min at 4 �C. For each type, a
no-serum control was added to test the input 500 TCID50. We tested pooled
HRV-16 anti-sera against HRV-16 in each assay as a standard. After spinoculation,
150 ml of HRV infection medium were added to each well. The 96-well plates were
incubated for 6 days at 32 �C and 5% CO2 and then stained with crystal violet as
described above. Wells were scored for the presence or absence of CPE.
Neutralizing antibody end point titres and 95% confidence intervals were
determined by the method of Reed and Muench38, as previously described for
HRV14,38. The 95% confidence interval indicates variability of three technical
replicates within a single nAb experiment. An example of the nAb assay and titre
calculation is provided in Supplementary Fig. 7.
