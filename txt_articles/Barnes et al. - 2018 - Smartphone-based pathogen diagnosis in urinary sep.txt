Background: There is an urgent need for rapid, sensitive, and affordable diagnostics for microbial infections at the
point-of-care. Although a number of innovative systems have been reported that transform mobile phones into
potential diagnostic tools, the translational challenge to clinical diagnostics remains a significant hurdle to over-
come.
Methods: A smartphone-based real-time loop-mediated isothermal amplification (smaRT-LAMP) system was de-
veloped for pathogen ID in urinary sepsis patients. The free, custom-built mobile phone app allows the phone to
serve as a stand-alone device for quantitative diagnostics, allowing the determination of genome copy-number of
bacterial pathogens in real time.
Findings: A head-to-head comparative bacterial analysis of urine from sepsis patients revealed that the perfor-
mance of smaRT-LAMP matched that of clinical diagnostics at the admitting hospital in a fraction of the time
(~1 h vs. 18–28 h). Among patients with bacteremic complications of their urinary sepsis, pathogen ID from
the urine matched that from the blood – potentially allowing pathogen diagnosis shortly after hospital admission.
Additionally, smaRT-LAMP did not exhibit false positives in sepsis patients with clinically negative urine cultures.
Interpretation: The smaRT-LAMP system is effective against diverse Gram-negative and -positive pathogens and
biological specimens, costs less than $100 US to fabricate (in addition to the smartphone), and is configurable for
the simultaneous detection of multiple pathogens. SmaRT-LAMP thus offers the potential to deliver rapid diagno-
sis and treatment of urinary tract infections and urinary sepsis with a simple test that can be performed at low
cost at the point-of-care.

1. Introduction
The World Health Organization and the U.S. Department of Health
and Human Services have recently prioritized the development of
rapid, accurate, and cost-effective diagnostics that can be used by
healthcare providers at the point-of-care (POC) to diagnose bacterial in-
fections [1,2]. Such diagnostic systems are especially needed in less
developed countries, where bacterial infections are more prevalent
and medical resources are limited [3,4]. The microbial diagnosis of path-
ogens directly from whole blood has been constrained by the low num-
ber of circulating organisms – typically just 1–100 colony forming units
(CFU)/mL during infection – and the frequency of false positive results
[5]. Moreover, standard culturing practices for pathogen identification
(ID) from blood can take 2 to 3 days [6]. To expedite the process, there
are numerous molecular methods for the detection of bacteria – includ-
ing PCR, probe-based direct detection, peptide nucleic acid-based fluo-
rescence in situ hybridization, and matrix-assisted laser desorption
ionization–time of flight mass (MALDI) spectrometry analysis [7–9].
However, these clinical techniques require prior sub-culturing in
blood culture bottles for bacterial detection (8–24 h), followed by path-
ogen ID (1.5–24 h), resulting in a total time of ~10–48 h from

 inoculation to time to pathogen ID [10–13]. Additionally, these methods
generally require access to specialized laboratory equipment, which can
be excessively costly and technologically complex for POC or resource-
limited settings.
Among different types of clinical samples, urine samples are partic-
ularly attractive because they can be obtained without invasive proce-
dures (such as a blood draw) and the clinically relevant break point
defining a positive clinical culture result for urinary tract infections
(UTIs) is ≥105 CFU/mL [14,15], making timely diagnostic detection po-
tentially simpler. UTIs are among the most common type of infection,
and are associated with recurrent illnesses, pyelonephritis with sepsis,
renal damage, pre-term birth, and complications from prolonged anti-
microbial therapy that include high-level resistance and Clostridium dif-
ficile colitis [16,17]. Unfortunately, there are presently no direct urine
testing methods for pathogen ID approved for human clinical diagnos-
tics [18]. Instead, urine specimens must be cultured before biochemical
characterization, and such culture methods are routinely confounded by
false positive results due to contamination at collection or false negative
results due to culture failure [14]. Thus, improved urine-based tests for
the rapid detection of pathogens would be highly valuable for improv-
ing patient outcomes for UTIs and in potentially fatal conditions arising
from septicemia (e.g., pyelonephritis) [19].
A number of innovative systems have recently been reported that
transform mobile phones into potential clinical POC diagnostic tools
based on various detection modalities. Examples include optical and
fluorescence imaging [20], microtiter assay interpretation [21], immu-
nologic detection (e.g. microfluidic chips [22–24]; antibody-conjugated
strips [25]) and nucleic acid detection (e.g., microfuge tubes [26,27]; mi-
crotiter plates [28]; microfluidic chambers [29]; microfluidic chips [30–
36]). Although these are notable advances in terms of broadening access
to sophisticated molecular diagnostics, translation to clinical utility
using patient-derived samples has been limited (e.g., HIV blood samples
[24], influenza throat swabs [25], Chlamydia trachomatis swabs [36]).
We
have
developed
a
rapid,
quantitative
and
accessible
smartphone-based detection system with clinical utility, achieving
timely diagnosis of bacteriuria from human patients. SmaRT-LAMP per-
formance matched that of standard clinical diagnostics, but within a
substantially shorter time-frame and lower cost, thus providing a
means for inexpensive and accurate diagnosis of UTIs and urinary sepsis
directly from clinical specimens at the POC.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Bacterial strains and media
Gram-negative bacterial isolates tested included Salmonella sp., Sal-
monella Typhimurium ATCC 14028 (ST), and S. enteritidis 4973 (SE)
[37,38], Escherichia coli (EC) strain ATCC 25922 (EC), Yersinia pseudotu-
berculosis YPIII/pIB1 (YP) [39], Klebsiella pneumoniae strain ATCC
13883 (KPN), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain ATCC 10145 (PA).
Gram-positive bacterial isolates analyzed included S. aureus USA300
(SA), a community-associated methicillin-resistant isolate causing the
most MRSA infections in the U.S. [40], and S. pneumoniae D39 (ser. 2)
(SPN) [41]. ST, SE, YP, EC, KPN, and PA [42,43] were streaked from frozen
stocks onto Luria-Bertani (LB) agar plates and single colonies were inoc-
ulated into LB broth and incubated overnight with shaking at 37 °C. All
incubations of YP were at 28 °C. SPN was streaked from frozen stocks
onto Todd-Hewitt (TH) broth agar plates containing 2% yeast extract
and incubated overnight at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator. Single colonies
were inoculated into TH broth containing 2% yeast extract and incubat-
ed overnight without shaking at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator. SA was
streaked from frozen stocks onto Tryptic Soy (TS) agar plates and incu-
bated overnight at 37 °C. Single colonies were inoculated into TS broth
and incubated overnight with shaking at 37 °C.
2.2. gDNA preparation
gDNA was prepared by growing bacteria as described above and
pelleting approximately 1 × 1010 total cells. Cells were resuspended in
0.5 mL TE buffer, 10 μL 10% SDS, 10 μL 10 mg/mL DNase-free RNase,
mixed and incubated 1 h at 37 °C. Next, 10 μL 10 mg/mL proteinase K
was added and samples were incubated 2 h at 65 °C. Samples were
then extracted with an equal volume of chloroform/isoamyl alcohol
and spun 5 m at 16,000 ×g in a microcentrifuge. The aqueous phase
was transferred to a fresh tube and DNA was extracted twice with phe-
nol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) and spun 5 m at 16,000 ×g.
The aqueous phase was transferred to a fresh tube and DNA was extract-
ed with 2.5 vol 100% ethanol and 0.1 vol 3 M sodium acetate. Precipitate
was washed once with 70% ethanol, supernatant was removed and pel-
let was dried briefly in a DNA speedvac. Pellets were resuspended in
100 μL ultrapure H2O, aliquoted and stored at −20 °C until use.
Research in context
Evidence before this study
Several innovative systems have recently been reported that
transform mobile phones into potential clinical point-of-care diag-
nostic tools; e.g., optical and fluorescence imaging, microtiter
assay interpretation, immunologic detection and nucleic acid de-
tection. Although these notable advances broaden access to so-
phisticated molecular diagnostics, translation to clinical utility
remains a significant challenge. PubMed and Google Scholar
were searched (up to August 20, 2018) using a variety of key
words (e.g., “smartphone urine”, “smartphone detection”,
“smartphone pathogen detection”, “smartphone detection clinical
utility”),
yielding
a
limited
number
of
reports
describing
smartphone-based detection systems using patient samples.
Therefore, we conclude that there remains an urgent need for
rapid, sensitive, and affordable diagnostics for microbial infections
at the point-of-care.
Added value of this study
A smartphone-based quantitative platform (smaRT-LAMP) was
developed that enabled pathogen ID in urine specimens collected
from sepsis patients. A comparative urine bacterial analysis be-
tween smartphone-based detection and clinical diagnostics car-
ried out by the hospital managing patient care revealed that
smaRT-LAMP matched the hospital diagnosis but in a much
shorter time-frame (~1 h vs. 18–28 h). Further, among patients
with bacteremic complications of their urinary sepsis (defined as
positive blood cultures), the pathogen ID from the urine matched
that of the blood, raising the possibility of pathogen diagnosis
shortly after hospital admission.
Implications of all the available evidence
Our findings highlight the clinical potential of the smaRT-LAMP
assay as a diagnostic tool for urinary tract infections, particularly
in the context of resource-limited settings that may lack sophisti-
cated instrumentation or expert clinical diagnosticians. The entire
detection system can be fabricated for less than $100 US (in addi-
tion to the smartphone), and can readily be configured for the si-
multaneous detection of multiple pathogens. SmaRT-LAMP thus
offers the potential to deliver rapid diagnosis and treatment of uri-
nary tract infections and urinary sepsis with a simple test that can
be performed at low cost at the point-of-care.

 2.3. LAMP reaction conditions
2.3.1. LAMP reagents
Betaine, calcein, KCl, MgSO4, MnCl2, (NH4)2SO4, and Triton X-100
were purchased from MilliporeSigma (St. Louis, MO). Bst 2.0 WarmStart
DNA polymerase was purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly,
MA), deoxynucleotide triphosphates from Promega (Madison, WI),
Tris (pH 7.5) from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA), Nuclease-free water,
DMSO, NaOH, and polysorbate 20 from ThermoFisher (Waltham, MA).
Tris (pH 8.8) was purchased from VWR (Radnor, PA), and PCR tubes
with optically clear lid strips from Bio-Rad (Hercules, CA). Primers
were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA).
2.3.2. Oligonucleotide primers
Supplemental Table S2 provides a list of oligonucleotide primer se-
quences. All synthetic oligos were purchased from Integrated DNA
Technologies (Coralville, IA). Previously designed primers targeting
the recF gene of Salmonella sp. [44] were employed with the addition
of loop primers chosen to accelerate the reaction by priming strand dis-
placement synthesis [45]. The set of primers consisted of two outer (F3
and B3), two inner (FIP and BIP), and two loop primers (F-Loop and B-
Loop). Additional published primer sets were selected for other patho-
gens: ST rfbJ [46]; SE Sdf I [47]; YP inv [48]; EC glxK [49], KPN fimD [50],
PA oprI [50], SPN lytA [51] (a F-Loop primer was developed for the SPN
lytA set); SA 16S rRNA [52].
2.3.3. Reaction conditions
We generated a 2× LAMP reagent “master mix” containing 40 mM
Tris (pH 8.8), 20 mM KCl, 16 mM MgSO4, 20 mM (NH4)2SO4, 0.2% v/v
polysorbate
20,
1.6 M
betaine,
2.8 mM
for
each
of
the
four
deoxynucleotide triphosphates, 0.58 U/μL of Bst WarmStart DNA poly-
merase, 0.4 μM each of F3, B3 primers, 3.2 μM each of FIP, BIP primers,
1.6 μM each of F-Loop, B-Loop primers, 750 μM MnCl2, and 37.6 μM
calcein. All reactions were conducted at 65 °C for 50 m.
2.4. Lysis protocol
2.4.1. Purified gDNA
20 μL of purified pathogen gDNA stock was diluted to specified con-
centrations, mixed 1:1 with 20 μL of LAMP master mix (at 2× final con-
centration), and split into 19 μL aliquots between qPCR-LAMP and
smaRT-LAMP.
2.4.2. CFU in buffer and blood
For analysis of CFU in buffer and blood, a modified alkaline treatment
was used [53]. A 2 μL sample was vortexed for 15 s after mixture with
78 μL [54] of lysis mix (50 mM NaOH and 0.5% Triton X-100 in the
final 80 μL lysate volume), then pulse-spun for 3 s on a microcentrifuge,
and heated at 100 °C for 10 m on an aluminum heat block. After cooling
on ice for 2 m, samples were centrifuged for 2 m at 16,000 x g and 40 μL
of supernatant removed to another tube. To neutralize, 6.4 μL of 1 M
Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) was added, vortexed briefly, and centrifuged for 2 m.
40 μL of supernatant was added to tubes containing 40 μL of 2× LAMP
master mix and mixed by pipetting. The resultant lysate was split into
two 38 μL aliquots that were analyzed by a Bio-Rad thermocycler and
smaRT-LAMP with the BactiCount app.
2.4.3. CFU in urine and feces
Urine and feces samples were analyzed similar to buffer and blood,
with the omission of centrifugation and pellet-removal steps. After
heating at 100 °C and cooling on ice, the 80 μL lysates were neutralized
with 12.8 μL of 1 M Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), vortexed briefly to mix, and 40 μL
of lysate was mixed with 40 μL 2× LAMP master mix before splitting
into two aliquots for analysis.
2.5. Preparation of pathogen samples in spiked buffer and uninfected mu-
rine specimens
For LOD buffer analysis, serial dilutions of S. typhimurium cells (101
to 105 CFU/mL) were spiked into buffer. Briefly, 1 mL samples of the
stated concentrations were reduced to 2 μL via sequential centrifuga-
tion. Blood from uninfected mice was collected by tail bleed into BD
Microtainer PST tubes with lithium heparin (Becton Dickinson, cat. no.
365985). Urine was collected into sterile microfuge tubes. Feces (0.1
g) was collected into sterile microfuge tubes, resuspended in 0.3 mL re-
action buffer, and the mixture was pulse-spun in a microcentrifuge for
5 s to pellet large particulates. Bacteria were diluted into reaction buffer
(20 mM Tris, pH 7.5), or spiked into blood, feces, or urine, collected from
uninfected mice, respectively, at specified concentrations. Mice: 8–12
wk. old male and female C57BL/6 J mice (Jackson Labs, Bar Harbor,
ME) were used for all infections and blood, urine, and feces specimen
collections.
2.6. Animal infection protocols and specimen collection
2.6.1. Gram-negative pathogens
All Gram-negative strains were grown overnight in LB. ST and SE
bacterial strains were pelleted by centrifugation, washed, and
suspended in sterile 0.2 M sodium phosphate buffer (pH 8.1). Mice
were orally infected with ST via gastric intubation at a dose of 2 × 107
cells (20× LD50) and whole blood was sampled at days 6 (pre-sepsis),
8 (sepsis), and 10 (severe sepsis) post-infection. For intraperitoneal
(i.p.) infections, a 20× LD50 dose of SE (103 cells) or YP (5 × 105 cells)
in 100 μL 0.15 M NaCl was administered and whole blood was collected
from the tail vein of septic mice at day 5 post-infection. EC, was
suspended in sterile phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and mice were in-
fected via the i.p. route at a dose of 1–2 × 107 bacteria (20× LD50) in
100 μL volume. Blood was taken for analyses at 48 h post-infection (se-
vere sepsis). A dose of 20× LD50 ensures that virtually all infected ani-
mals will undergo sepsis.
2.6.2. Gram-positive pathogens
SPN cultures were diluted 1:10 into fresh TH broth and sub-cultured
to mid-log phase (A600 = 0.4), pelleted in a microfuge at 16,000 ×g for
2 m, washed, and suspended in 0.15 M NaCl. i.p. injection of 1 to 2 ×
104 cells (20× LD50) was done in 100 μL 0.15 M NaCl. Whole blood
was collected from the tail vein of septic mice at 48 h post-infection
into microtainer tubes. SA cultures were diluted 1:100 into fresh TS
broth and sub-cultured to mid-log phase (A600 = 0.4), pelleted in a
microfuge at 16,000 ×g for 2 m, washed, and suspended in 0.15 M
NaCl. Intravenous (i.v.) injection into the retroorbital sinus of 1–2 ×
108 cells (20× LD50) was done in 100 μL 0.15 M NaCl. Whole blood
was collected from the tail vein of septic mice at 48 h post-infection
into microtainer tubes. Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee
of the University of California, Santa Barbara approved studies under-
taken herein.
2.7. Urine specimens from human sepsis patients
Human specimens were collected at Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital,
Santa Barbara, CA. Patients were selected who met the clinical criteria
for sepsis based on fever, increased heart rate, and/or elevated white
blood cell count, and had a suspected urinary source of their severe in-
fection. Some of these patients had severe sepsis, with evidence of end-
organ dysfunction or septic shock. Upon presentation at the hospital,
urine and blood specimens were collected from patients before antibi-
otic administration. A comparative urine bacterial analysis was per-
formed between smaRT-LAMP and clinical diagnostics carried out by
the hospital managing patient care. Pathogen ID in the urine and
blood of sepsis patients was determined by the hospital microbiology
laboratory. The bacterial load in urine specimens was assessed by both
L. Barnes et al. / EBioMedicine 36 (2018) 73–82
 direct colony count, and smaRT-LAMP utilizing primer sets directed
against the urine pathogen identified in the clinical setting. The bacterial
load in the urine of human sepsis patients with clinically negative urine
cultures (below the standard threshold for infection of 105 CFU) [14,15]
was determined by the hospital microbiology laboratory (clinical cul-
ture) versus an academic laboratory examining CFU by direct colony
count, qPCR-LAMP, and smaRT-LAMP, utilizing E. coli primer sets. A lin-
ear fit of standard curves with a clinically relevant bacterial burden (5 ×
104 –5 × 107 CFU/mL) was used to determine LAMP-based CFUs. LAMP-
based assays were sometimes inhibited in cloudy urine specimens (pre-
cipitated phosphate crystals and/or pyuria) [15], but inhibition was re-
lieved by a 1:10 dilution of the specimen in 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5).
Institutional Human Subjects Use Committees of the University of Cali-
fornia, Santa Barbara and Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital approved stud-
ies undertaken herein.
2.8. Data analysis
Real-Time LAMP traces were automatically generated at the end of
each run for each sample by the qPCR thermocycler and the BactiCount
app. Trace files were transferred to a personal computer (PC), where
MATLAB was used (described in detail in the Supplementary Methods
section) to find the maximum of the derivative taken over a coarse
time stepper (i.e., a chosen length of time over which to average the de-
rivative). The resultant Tt value was linearly related to the logarithm of
the input concentration and used to determine the concentration of
bacteria in septic murine samples using standard curves with a mini-
mum of 10 reaction replicates per concentration at 5 × 106 CFU/reac-
tion and below. All steps of this process can be automatically
performed by the Bacticount app without using a PC.
2.9. Hardware of smaRT-LAMP platform
All experiments were performed in low-profile 0.2-mL PCR strips
(Bio-Rad cat. no. TLS-0801) covered with optical flat strips (Bio-Rad
cat. no. TLS-0803). Sample tubes were placed in an aluminum sample
block (LightLabs cat. no. A-7079) on a hot plate (HP30A digital alumi-
num hotplate, Torrey Pines Scientific, Carlsbad, CA). A cardboard box
large enough to cover the hot plate was painted black and two flexible
cables of 96 W, 480 nm, 672 lm, 96-LEDs (DealeXtreme cat. no.
180563) were affixed to the inside top cover of the box. LEDs were
powered using a single output DC power supply (UA8001A, Agilent
Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). A Samsung Galaxy S7 smartphone
(Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd.) was outfitted with a 520 ± 10 nm
bandpass filter (Edmund Optics cat. no. 65–699) for visual detection of
emitted green light (Supplementary Fig. 1). All qPCR reactions were
performed on a Bio-Rad CFX96 qPCR Thermocycler.
2.10. Development and function of bacticount android application
2.10.1. Bacticount android application
The Bacticount smartphone application was built on a Samsung Gal-
axy S7 phone using the developer tools in Android Studio IDE, Android
SDK (Android), and OpenCV library. The app can be downloaded and
installed from the Google Play Store; the user is then prompted to install
the “OpenCV Manager” application, which is employed to handle com-
plex algorithms such as image rendering, histogram generation, and
back-calculations. Upon opening the app, the user is initially presented
with an option for a step-by-step tutorial. In addition to the tutorial, the
user is given a choice to “Start Bacterial Analysis”; when selected, the
user is prompted to pick the correct sample type (Blood, Urine, or
Feces). The user can then follow a three-step analysis procedure: 1) re-
cord a standard curve for the pathogen in spiked samples; 2) record a
sample reaction from unknown analytes; and 3) select and view results
to analyze a sample reaction using a specific standard curve to instantly
determine bacterial burden (Supplemental Fig. 2a–c).
2.10.2. Running standard curve and unknown sample reactions
When running a standard curve or unknown sample reaction, the
app launches a specialized viewfinder, allowing the user to carefully
center the reaction vials in the view-frame of the phone's camera,
such that their intensity can be analyzed over time. After entering a
name, the user must load samples and press “start”, which begins a
timer to correct for lost reaction time while setting up the box and
aiming the camera (Supplemental Fig. 2d, e). When the user selects
“Begin Recording Amplification,” the application proceeds to take one
photograph of the amplification reaction every 10 s over the course of
a 50 m period (Fig. 1b, Supplemental Fig. 2f). The app performs image

 processing for each of the vials outlined in the viewfinder to extract the
average green intensity of each pixel, which is stored in a matrix. For the
“1. Record Standard Curve” option, the software also prompts the user
to align each reference sample with a provided sample map so that
the input starting concentrations of DNA are known. The standard
curve is determined through a linear regression fit of Tt vs. log10[conc],
which is stored as a .pasc file for determining the results in future
tests. When the user has selected the “2. Record Sample” option, the
app will record traces for each sample, to be analyzed later. The numer-
ical sample traces and collected time-stamped photos are saved as a
.parr file and as .jpeg files, respectively, which may be extracted by the
user to any computer.
2.10.3. Automated data analysis
When the user selects “3. Select and view results”, the app will
prompt the user to choose a standard curve that has been recorded as
outlined in the previous section with known standard concentrations.
After data processing and analysis (described in the Supplementary
Methods section), the Tt of unknown test samples are related to their
initial concentrations via the standard curve. On its final screen, the
app displays the number of bacterial CFU in each reaction vial (Supple-
mental Fig. 2 g–i).
3. Results
3.1. Overview of the SmaRT-LAMP system
The smaRT-LAMP procedure can be performed with freshly collect-
ed biological specimens (e.g., blood, urine, or feces), which are then
lysed with a simple NaOH and detergent treatment and subsequent
heating procedure (Fig. 1a). The resultant lysate is combined with a
pre-mixed LAMP reaction mixture that will generate a fluorescent sig-
nal in response to successful amplification (see Methods). These sam-
ples are then placed in an inexpensive apparatus consisting of a
platform that can simultaneously accommodate up to 36 samples, a sin-
gle-temperature heat block, and an LED light source (Supplementary
Fig. 1). The entire detection system can be fabricated for less than
$100 US, not including the smartphone (Supplementary Table 1).
The streaming image data from smaRT-LAMP are collected in real-
time and analyzed by a smartphone running the Bacticount app (Fig.
1b, Supplementary Fig. 2), which we developed for the Android operat-
ing system and have made freely available through the Google Play
store. We derive the template DNA copy number by using a ‘coarse de-
rivative’ algorithm [55] to convert the fluorescence data into a time-to-
threshold parameter (Tt) – the time at which the rate of fluorescence in-
crease is fastest. This Tt measurement indicates the exponential phase of
the LAMP reaction and is linearly proportional to the logarithm of the
template DNA copy number [56]. Thus, we can quantitatively determine
the concentration of gDNA in a sample based on a standard curve of Tt
measurements derived from samples of known concentration. As
shown below, our coarse derivative algorithm is robust and produces
highly reproducible data, even with fluctuations in background fluores-
cence, camera recalibrations, and shifts in the relative position between
the sample and the smartphone camera.
3.2. SmaRT-LAMP sensitivity and intra- and interspecies detection
We tested whether the sensitivity of smaRT-LAMP can match that of
a LAMP assay performed in a real-time quantitative PCR instrument
(qPCR) for detecting gDNA of Salmonella Typhimurium (ST). We used
a set of six primers designed to target the highly conserved recF gene
[44,57]. These primers are specific to Salmonella sp., and thus are not ex-
pected to hybridize to DNA of unrelated pathogens. We compared the
smaRT-LAMP and qPCR instrument for measuring the gDNA of ST over
a broad range, from 5 × 101 –5 × 104 copies of the genome. SmaRT-
LAMP and qPCR instruments showed equivalent performance in this
assay, as evidenced by the Tt dose dependency, trace quality and reac-
tion time (Supplementary Fig. 3).
Strain discrimination is imperative for clinical diagnostics and treat-
ment, and we demonstrated that the smaRT-LAMP platform is compat-
ible
with
both
intra-
and
interspecies
detection
and
strain
discrimination. We tested this by employing primer sets specific to
gDNA templates from eight different Gram-negative and -positive path-
ogens, including ST, S. enteritidis (SE), Escherichia coli (EC), Klebsiella
pneumoniae (KPN), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA), Yersinia pseudotuber-
culosis (YP), Streptococcus pneumoniae (SPN) and Staphylococcus aureus
(SA) (Supplementary Table 2). SmaRT-LAMP achieved robust interspe-
cies detection and strain discrimination of these Gram-negative and -
positive pathogens, with each of the eight primer sets amplifying only
the gDNA of their cognate template but not any of the seven other tem-
plates (Table 1). SmaRT-LAMP can distinguish between ST and SE, which
are serovars of the same Salmonella subspecies (S. enterica subsp.
enterica) that are 99% identical at the DNA sequence level [58]. It should
be noted that the reduced primer sensitivity for ST relative to the other
pathogens tested is not indicative of a failure of the reaction but rather
the limited number of sequences available to design LAMP primer sets
that distinguish Salmonella subsp. that are closely related at the DNA
level (e.g., ST vs. SE).
3.3. Pathogen detection using whole bacterial cells
We next assessed whether our lysis protocol enables quantitative
pathogen detection using whole bacterial cells, and if smaRT-LAMP
can match the sensitivity of an equivalent LAMP assay performed in
an qPCR instrument. ST cells were serially diluted into buffer at concen-
trations ranging from 101 to 105 CFU/mL. One mL of each dilution sam-
ple was then reduced to 2 μL via sequential centrifugation and subjected
to the LAMP protocol. We derived a standard curve through a linear re-
gression fit of Tt vs. log10[CFU] (Fig. 2a–d); see Methods). The resultant
limit of detection (LOD) was ≤10 CFU/mL for both smaRT-LAMP and
qPCR. We also observed excellent reaction efficiency in terms of the per-
cent of samples that were successfully amplified at 10 CFU/mL (70 and
90%, respectively; (Fig. 2e, f). Such a low LOD (≤10 CFU/mL) obtained
from sequential centrifugation may have clinical utility for swabbing in-
fection sites, medical devices and other potentially contaminated
surfaces.
We then tested whether our lysis procedure works with Gram-pos-
itive and -negative pathogens that have large differences in cell enve-
lope structure. Using the same lysis protocol, we assessed the
performance of both amplification platforms against Gram-positive
SPN and SA, as well as Gram-negative SE, EC and YP. Briefly, 2 μL of
spiked buffer samples containing 5 × 103 –5 × 107 CFU/mL of bacteria
were processed and assessed in the smaRT-LAMP and qPCR instruments
as described above. Both platforms showed strong performance against
all five pathogens, with a LOD of 5 × 103 –1 × 105 CFU/mL (equivalent

 to 2–100 CFU/reaction), clear Tt dose dependency, and strong reaction
efficiency (Supplementary Fig. 4). These data indicate that the smaRT-
LAMP system is compatible with a diverse array of pathogens.
3.4. Pathogen detection in spiked murine whole blood, urine, and feces
Next, we examined the performance of smaRT-LAMP and qPCR-
LAMP in diverse biological specimens and tested whether bacterial de-
tection can be achieved at clinically-relevant concentrations. Briefly, ST
was serially diluted in murine whole blood, urine, and feces over a
range of 5 × 103 –5 × 107 CFU/mL. After collecting and processing 2 μL
aliquots from these samples, half of each lysate reaction was subjected
to LAMP in both the smaRT-LAMP and qPCR platforms.
Direct specimen testing in whole blood is problematic due to the low
bacterial load typically observed in circulation of sepsis patients (1–100
CFU/mL) [5]. As a result, clinical detection methods require samples to
first be incubated in blood culture bottles, resulting in a total time of
~10–48 h from inoculation to time to pathogen ID [10–13]. Both
smaRT-LAMP and qPCR instruments were able to achieve this level of
detection sensitivity of ST from whole blood, with an LOD of 5 × 103
CFU/mL (Fig. 3a, b) – equivalent to just 2 CFU/reaction – with clear Tt
dose dependency and strong reaction efficiency (Fig. 3i, j).
Importantly, smaRT-LAMP offers the potential to achieve rapid di-
rect detection of clinically-relevant signatures of bacterial infection in
urine. Urine can offer an early readout of patients with UTIs, and poten-
tially in cases of sepsis– particularly those that have a suspected urinary
source– since infected urine is associated with a much higher bacterial
load than blood (≥ 105 CFU/mL) [14,15]. However, there is currently
no direct specimen testing method approved for urine, principally due
to the challenges of microbial contamination at the point of collection
[14,18]. Thus, the gold standard of care entails a bacterial culture step,
delaying identification for at least 16 h [18,59,60]. Once again, we dem-
onstrated that smaRT-LAMP could match the performance of the more
sophisticated and costly qPCR instrument, achieving a clinically-rele-
vant LOD of 1–2 × 104 CFU/mL (Fig. 3c, d), which is within the range
needed to demonstrate the clinically relevant break point defining a
positive clinical culture result for UTIs (105 CFU/mL) [14,15]. Notably,
the scattered distribution observed at lower concentrations is a statisti-
cal byproduct of the extremely small number of bacteria per sample,
with samples at the lowest concentrations containing on average two
or fewer CFU each. We also demonstrated that our assay could achieve
equally sensitive performance in testing fecal samples (Fig. 3e, f). As
with the blood specimens, we observed excellent reaction efficiency
for both urine and fecal samples (Fig. 3g–j). The LOD of smaRT-LAMP
is comparable to that of currently used clinical diagnostic technologies
for urine and feces, but our system's capacity for direct specimen testing
and minimal sample preparation offers a major advantage in terms of
time to treatment.
Finally, we confirmed that smaRT-LAMP direct specimen testing
works with diverse pathogens in a variety of specimen types. Specifical-
ly, we assessed the performance of smaRT-LAMP with SPN, SA, SE, EC
and YP spiked into murine blood, and with EC spiked into donor
human urine. SmaRT-LAMP showed strong performance with all of
these pathogen-specimen combinations, achieving LODs in the range
of 5 × 103 –1 × 105 CFU/mL (2–40 CFU/reaction) (Fig. 4), which were
again comparable with results from qPCR (Supplementary Fig. 5).
These data indicate that the smaRT-LAMP platform is compatible with
a diverse array of pathogens and biological specimens.
3.5. Pathogen detection in murine models of sepsis
We assessed whether the smaRT-LAMP system was compatible with
several murine models of sepsis. Mice were orally infected with ST and
whole blood was sampled at day 6 (pre-sepsis); day 8 (sepsis), and day
10 post-infection (severe sepsis). SmaRT-LAMP enabled pathogen de-
tection via direct specimen testing of whole blood at the 3 infection
time points, with an LOD of 104 CFU/mL, equivalent to 4 CFU/reaction
(Fig. 5a–c). Similarly, pathogen detection was observed in several
other murine models of sepsis (SPN, SA, SE, YP, EC) (Supplementary
Fig. 6). However, the CFUs in circulation for all sepsis models tested
(104 –106 CFU/mL) were well-above the range needed for clinical utility
in humans (1–100 CFU)/mL) [5]. It should be noted that the relatively
high LOD in circulation is not indicative of a failure of the reaction but
rather a physical limitation of the 2 μL sample volume, resulting in a
~40 μL reaction volume that is near the maximum allowable with the
current platform (see Methods). Thus, we redirected subsequent efforts
on pathogen detection in urine with an LOD of 5 × 103 CFU/mL, which
is well within the range needed to demonstrate the clinically relevant

 break point defining a positive clinical culture result for UTI patients
(≥105 CFU/mL) [14,15].
3.6. Quantitative pathogen diagnosis in urine of human sepsis patients
Based on its strong performance with spiked murine urine samples,
we assessed whether smaRT-LAMP may have immediate clinical utility
for the POC analysis of urine specimens from human patients. We se-
lected patients who met the clinical criteria for sepsis based on fever, in-
creased heart rate, and/or elevated white blood cell count, and had a
suspected urinary source of their severe infection. Some of these pa-
tients had severe sepsis, with evidence of end-organ dysfunction or sep-
tic shock. Briefly, upon presentation at the hospital, urine and blood
specimens were collected from patients before antibiotic administra-
tion. A comparative urine bacterial analysis was performed between
smaRT-LAMP and clinical diagnostics carried out by the hospital manag-
ing patient care. Pathogen ID in the urine and blood of sepsis patients
was determined by the hospital microbiology laboratory. The bacterial
load in urine of ten patient specimens was assessed by both direct colo-
ny count, and smaRT-LAMP utilizing primer sets directed against the
urine pathogen identified in the clinical setting. SmaRT-LAMP achieved
rapid and accurate detection of EC, KPN, and PA in urine specimens of
sepsis patients (105 –108 CFUs), matching that of the more cumber-
some and expensive qPCR analysis (Table 2). Importantly, both
smaRT-LAMP and qPCR-LAMP systems achieved a diagnosis in ~1 h, a
fraction of the time required for clinical diagnostics by the hospital mi-
crobiology laboratory (18–28 h). Moreover, since false positive results
are a primary concern due to contamination at collection [14], the bac-
terial load in urine of sepsis patients with clinically negative urine
cultures was determined by the hospital microbiology laboratory (clin-
ical culture) versus an academic laboratory examining CFU by direct col-
ony count, qPCR-LAMP, and smaRT-LAMP. The bacterial load discerned
by qPCR-LAMP and smaRT-LAMP direct specimen testing matched the
low– or non-detectable– bacterial load obtained by clinical culture or di-
rect colony count in all five cases (Supplementary Table S3). These data
demonstrate the feasibility of improving time to detection and quantita-
tion in clinical settings and at the POC. Further, in the six patients who
had bacteremic complications (defined as positive blood cultures) of
their urinary sepsis, the pathogen ID from the urine matched that of
the blood in all six cases (patient 002, 006, 010, 012, 015, 019). This con-
cordance demonstrates the applicability of smaRT-LAMP to even the
most severe cases of sepsis, with the advantage of accurate and rapid di-
agnosis at the POC in these cases, and the potential to greatly accelerate
directed therapy for urinary tract infections. Notably, time to treatment
was the significant factor associated with positive patient outcomes in
emergency care for sepsis [19]. SmaRT-LAMP thus offers the potential
to deliver rapid diagnosis and treatment of urinary tract infections and
urinary sepsis.
4. Discussion
Efforts to improve global public health will benefit immensely from
accurate, rapid, affordable and user-friendly methods for detecting mi-
crobial pathogens at the POC. Toward this goal, we have developed
smaRT-LAMP, a rapid, portable diagnostic platform that can achieve
sensitive and accurate bacterial detection with performance compara-
ble to gold-standard clinical methodologies based on costly, specialized
instrumentation. We have demonstrated that smaRT-LAMP can

 quantitatively detect diverse pathogens in blood, urine and feces, with
an LOD that matches what can be achieved with an qPCR instrument-
based assay. Perhaps most importantly, we demonstrated that our plat-
form can achieve robust detection of different bacterial pathogens in
urine specimens collected from sepsis patients, matching the hospital
diagnosis but in a much shorter time-frame (~1 h vs. 18–28 h). These re-
sults highlight the clear clinical potential of the smaRT-LAMP assay as a
diagnostic tool for UTIs, particularly in the context of resource-limited
settings that may lack sophisticated instrumentation or expert clinical
diagnosticians.

 SmaRT-LAMP requires little more than a smartphone, hot plate, LED
lights, low force mini-centrifuge, and a cardboard box, making our ap-
proach highly affordable and accessible. Indeed, the entire detection
system can be fabricated for less than $100 US (in addition to the
smartphone), and can readily be configured for the simultaneous detec-
tion of multiple pathogens. SmaRT-LAMP thus offers the potential to le-
verage a widely available consumer technology to affordably deliver
state-of-the-art nucleic acid diagnostics technology for accurate, quanti-
tative pathogen detection at the POC.
Early diagnosis and intervention enabled by smaRT-LAMP direct
urine testing could prove highly advantageous in a number of clinical
contexts. These include cases with clinical manifestations indicating
UTI (among the most common types of infection) [16,17] and potential-
ly fatal conditions arising from septicemia (e.g., pyelonephritis) [15,19].
Such an assay could also prove useful for monitoring pregnant women
with asymptomatic bacteriuria that receive antibiotics to reduce the of
risk of acute cystitis, pyelonephritis and/or miscarriage [61]. Early inter-
vention is also essential for accelerating directed therapy and encourag-
ing the judicious use of antibiotics to minimize the emergence of
multidrug-resistant strains that have limited treatment options (e.g.,
MRSA, extended-spectrum β-lactamase–producing (ESBL) and carba-
penem-resistant (CRE) Enterobacteriaceae, and multidrug-resistant PA
and Acinetobacter sp. [62–64]. SmaRT-LAMP may complement clinical
UTI diagnostic practices such as colorimetric dipstick assays, microsco-
py, lateral flow assays (approved for veterinary use) that are rapid (1–
2 h) but do not identify the pathogen, and MALDI-TOF mass spectrom-
etry that rapidly identifies the pathogen but requires bacterial culture
(~18–28 h) and expensive instrumentation [18].
There are numerous opportunities to further extend the utility of the
smart-LAMP platform in the future. First, the LOD in diverse biological
specimens could be improved simply by increasing the sample volume
used in the assay (e.g., from 2 μL to ≥1 mL). Although this will increase
the cost of reagents and the size of the peripheral apparatus, the LOD
will scale linearly with sample volume, potentially making it possible
to detect 1–100 CFU from a 1 mL blood specimen. Such sensitivity
could enable extremely early-stage diagnosis and intervention, particu-
larly in the context of multidrug-resistant pathogens for which treat-
ment options are highly limited. Second, multiplexed detection of
pathogens could be readily achieved with appropriate LAMP primers
that can be designed from whole-genome databases [65,66]. Finally,
the utility of our system for field applications could be further improved
with lyophilized reagents, which will be especially useful in resource-
limited areas where refrigeration is impractical [67,68]. We therefore
believe that smaRT-LAMP holds exciting potential to bring state-of-
the-art nucleic acid diagnostics technology within easy reach of non-ex-
pert smartphone users.

Pathogen ID in the urine and blood of sepsis patients was determined by the hospital mi-
