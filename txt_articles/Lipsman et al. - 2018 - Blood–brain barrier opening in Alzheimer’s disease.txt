Magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound in combination with intravenously injected
microbubbles has been shown to transiently open the blood–brain barrier, and reduce beta-
amyloid and tau pathology in animal models of Alzheimer’s disease. Here, we used focused
ultrasound to open the blood–brain barrier in five patients with early to moderate Alzheimer’s
disease in a phase I safety trial. In all patients, the blood–brain barrier within the target
volume was safely, reversibly, and repeatedly opened. Opening the blood–brain barrier did
not result in serious clinical or radiographic adverse events, as well as no clinically significant
worsening on cognitive scores at three months compared to baseline. Beta-amyloid levels
were measured before treatment using [18F]-florbetaben PET to confirm amyloid deposition
at the target site. Exploratory analysis suggested no group-wise changes in amyloid post-
sonication. The results of this safety and feasibility study support the continued investigation
of focused ultrasound as a potential novel treatment and delivery strategy for patients with
Alzheimer’s disease.

 A
lzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common neurode-
generative disorder, marked by progressive decline in
memory and cognition over decades. The pathologic
hallmarks of AD include extracellular Aβ plaques and intracel-
lular neurofibrillary tangles, changes that contribute to wide-
spread metabolic and neurochemical disturbances, and which
culminate in neuronal degeneration and cell death. For the last
three decades, the amyloid cascade hypothesis, which posits Aβ
deposition as a key initial step in the pathogenesis of AD, has
been the dominant theory driving treatment development1. While
the role of amyloid burden in the development and progression of
clinical symptoms remains unclear and under active investiga-
tion, plaque clearance has been a key target of numerous clinical
trials. Results to date have largely been disappointing2,3, although
one recent trial linked significant reduction in amyloid to stabi-
lization of cognitive decline at 1 year4.
The blood–brain barrier (BBB) is a major obstacle for the
effective delivery of therapeutic compounds to the brain,
imposing size and biochemical restrictions on the passage of
molecules5. Various strategies to overcome the BBB have been
investigated, including direct intracranial infusion6, convection
enhanced delivery7, diuretic agents8, and biomimetics9. These
approaches have been limited by lack of specificity, safety con-
cerns, and a failure to achieve adequate concentrations of deliv-
ered compounds to sufficient volumes of brain tissue10,11. A safe
and effective means of bypassing the barrier temporarily could aid
in delivering even large molecules, such as antibodies and growth
factors, directly to brain pathology.
Magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) is
an emerging non-invasive surgical modality that, when coupled
with injected microbubbles, transiently opens the BBB with a
high degree of spatial and temporal specificity. Comprised of a
phased array transducer system of 1024 individually steered
elements, the current clinical MRgFUS device can target brain
regions with sub-millimetric accuracy, using real-time feedback
for monitoring and intraoperative image guidance12. At high
frequencies, focused ultrasound has been used to non-invasively
ablate the ventro-intermediate nucleus of the thalamus in
patients with refractory essential tremor, with a safety and effi-
cacy profile comparable to open neurosurgical approaches13,14.
Other clinical trials have investigated thermoablative applica-
tions in tremor due to Parkinson’s disease15 and obsessive
compulsive disorder16. At lower frequencies, the interaction of
ultrasound with injected microbubbles results in transient dis-
ruption of the BBB17.
Focused ultrasound has been used in animal models of diseases
including brain tumors, Parkinson’s disease, and AD, wherein the
delivery of a range of therapeutic substrates has been enhanced,
including
antibodies18–20,
chemotherapy21,
nanoparticles22,
Herceptin23, viruses24, and stem cells25. In transgenic mouse
models of AD, ultrasound was used to deliver antibodies against
beta-amyloid and tau, with significant reductions in pathology
and a positive impact on memory performance18,19. Further
studies in mouse models of amyloidosis demonstrated that even
without exogenous antibody administration, BBB disruption by
focused ultrasound reduced plaque burden, triggered neuronal
plasticity, and prevented spatial memory deficits26–28.
Given the compelling preclinical evidence, we investigate for
the first time the use of non-invasive MRgFUS to open the BBB in
human patients, with mild-to-moderate, amyloid-positive AD.
Our primary aim is to evaluate the clinical safety and technical
feasibility of this procedure, and secondarily to measure the
influence, if any, on clinical and beta-amyloid imaging markers of
AD. We find that the BBB can be safely, temporarily, and
repeatedly opened in an amyloid-rich brain region with a high
degree of anatomic specificity.
Results
Study patients. We enrolled five patients, three men and two
women, with a mean age of 66.2 years (Fig. 1, Table 1). Average
baseline Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) was 22.8,
suggestive of mild-to-moderate stage disease. The level of amyloid
on
[18F]-florbetaben
positron
emission
tomography
(PET)
exceeded the cutoff for amyloid positivity (standardized uptake
value ratio; SUVr ≥1.43) for all patients29. Four patients com-
pleted both first and second stages of sonication. Patient 4
developed a respiratory illness unrelated to the procedure shortly
before stage 2, and we elected not to proceed with the second
stage given the unknown risk of opening the BBB in the context
of an active infection.
Primary outcome. The BBB was successfully opened in all
patients who underwent the focused ultrasound procedure (Fig. 2
and Supplementary Figure 1). We primarily targeted white matter
in the frontal lobe, attempting to be specific to the dorsolateral
prefrontal cortex where possible, given anatomic constraints. The
average maximum sonication power was 4.6 W with an average of
3.6 sonications administered for stage 1 and 4.5 W for 7.5 soni-
cations for stage 2 (Supplementary Table 1). BBB opening was
achieved predictably at approximately 50% power at which
cavitation was observed during a ramp test. Immediately after
sonication, a discrete rectangular-shaped gadolinium enhance-
ment can be seen in the targeted region on T1-weighted images
(Fig. 2). At 24 h following the procedure, there was resolution of
enhancement in the targeted region, indicating closure of the BBB
(Fig. 2).
No patient experienced a serious adverse event during this
study.
There
were
no
deaths,
hemorrhages,
swelling,
or
neurologic deficits on the day of procedure or during follow-up.
One patient showed a transient increase in the Neuropsychiatric
Inventory—Questionnaire (NPI-Q) score, during the 1-month
visit following stage 2 (Table 2). All patients were discharged the
morning after their procedures. Patient 1 experienced headaches
during follow-up, which resolved with updating his prescription
for his vision.
Radiologically, there was no evidence of intracerebral hemor-
rhage or swelling. In two patients, patient 1 and 5, discrete round
hypointensities on gradient echo were seen immediately after
sonication (Supplementary Figure 2). Although these findings
may indicate microhemorrhage, they resolved by the 24-h follow-
up magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), rather than persisting, as
is more typical of hemosiderin-type staining from microbleeds.
Secondary outcome. For our secondary outcome, we did not
detect a clinically significant change between 3 months and
baseline, on tests of patient cognition or daily functioning.
Table 2 lists the clinical psychometric data at baseline and follow-
up visits. Group PET changes in the regions of interest (ROIs)
after stages 1 and 2 compared to baseline were −0.14 ± 0.22
(standard deviation, n = 5) and −0.08 ± 0.21 (n = 4), respectively,
which were not statistically significant (p > 0.2, paired t-test,
Fig. 3, Supplementary Fig. 3–7, Supplementary Tables 2, 3).
Discussion
We demonstrate for the first time, safe, reversible, and repeated,
non-invasive opening of the BBB using MRgFUS in patients with
amyloid-positive AD. BBB opening was achieved with less than
1% of the energy required to create a thermocoagulative lesion,
thereby enhancing the safety and expanding the treatment
envelope of the procedure30. We observed no serious clinical or
radiographic adverse events, with progressively larger brain
regions opened, and complete closure of the barrier within 24 h.

 No previous studies have reported non-invasive and reversible
BBB opening in humans. Previously published work investigated
pulsed ultrasound via a surgically implanted device, in patients
with malignant brain tumors31. Our trial utilized a non-invasive
device,
guided
by
real-time
imaging
and
thermometry,
demonstrating BBB opening with millimeter accuracy, and its
successful closure within 24 h.
In this pilot study, we opened the BBB twice in the right frontal
lobe, 1 month apart with the second volume twice the first.
Because brains affected by AD are often atrophic, it was necessary

 to adjust the axial dimensions of the planned target so as to avoid
sulci and blood vessels. Doing so underscored the importance of
in vivo imaging during these procedures, and the reliance on the
clinical and imaging feedback afforded by the ultrasound system
used for this trial. Acoustic feedback monitoring, contrast
enhanced MR images, and physical examinations between soni-
cations were key in determining a safe power for BBB opening
and detecting any adverse events such as bleeding. In general, the
procedure was well tolerated by all patients.
Efficient MRgFUS-mediated BBB opening is influenced by a
number of procedural and technical variables. Determining the opti-
mal power via a ramp test is the first step to achieving uniform BBB
opening. Other factors include microbubble size and dose, volume and
type of tissue targeted, microbubble handling, and coordination
between sonication and microbubble injection. As with any procedure,
additional experience will enhance its efficiency and success, and while
we achieved successful BBB opening in all patients, results were most
uniform in the last two patients (Supplementary Fig. 1).

 Exploratory analysis of the [18F]-florbetaben PET results did
not identify a clear effect, in either direction, of MRgFUS BBB
opening on beta-amyloid deposition. The BBB is important in
maintaining brain homeostasis, and its role in the clearance of
pathologic proteins is complex. While the integrity of the BBB in
AD
is
controversial32,33,
preclinical
studies
have
shown
improvements in both pathology and phenotype following
focused ultrasound, providing evidence that BBB opening alone,
or in conjunction with a therapeutic, could be a potential treat-
ment for patients. The mechanisms of beta-amyloid clearance
following
focused
ultrasound
remain
under
investigation.
MRgFUS BBB opening in mouse models has been shown to allow
the entry of endogenous antibodies and blood-borne proteins in
targeted areas of the brain, which could contribute to beta-
amyloid opsonization and clearance by glial cells26,27. In addition,
MRgFUS BBB opening may increase the permeability of the
glymphatic system as fluorescent-tagged Aβ protein clearance
follows along the perivascular spaces of arterioles and venules34.
This study has several important limitations. First, our sample
size is small, and although we provide evidence of clinical and
radiographic safety, this limits generalizability. Second, the study
was not designed to study efficacy, and we cannot draw conclu-
sions about what effect, if any, focused ultrasound might have on
the clinical symptoms of AD or on beta-amyloid clearance or
deposition. Four enrolled patients were further under the age of
65, suggesting the possibility of earlier onset disease, distinct from
sporadic AD. The relatively young age of enrolled patients may
further affect generalizability given that prevalence of AD
increases with age. As this was a phase I, pilot study, our objective
was to obtain safety data in demonstrated amyloid-positive AD,
with subsequent larger trials, permitting more detailed subgroup
analyses.
For this study, we targeted a non-eloquent brain region, and
did not combine focused ultrasound with a therapeutic. Instead,
we chose to focus entirely on the question of safety and feasibility,
and whether in the context of known amyloid pathology, non-
invasive BBB opening can be done reversibly and repeatedly in
progressively larger volumes. Focused ultrasound, when com-
bined with injected microbubbles, opened the BBB within sec-
onds, and with a high degree of specificity and accuracy,
suggesting the possibility of targeting much larger volumes.
Furthermore, the control over the spatial location of the target
area, afforded by real-time imaging with sub-millimeter resolu-
tion, suggests that the BBB may be opened in areas with complex
anatomy such as the hippocampus and other eloquent cortical
and subcortical structures. Future studies targeting such struc-
tures at earlier stages of the illness, and in a larger group of
patients, will help determine whether focused ultrasound BBB
opening alone, or with a therapeutic, can be of any benefit for this
devastating disease.
Methods
Study design and participants. This open label, prospective, proof-of-concept,
phase I trial was designed to study the safety and feasibility of repeated BBB
opening in patients with AD with demonstrated amyloid deposition in the targeted
area. To improve safety, the study was divided into two stages, graded by the
volume of brain tissue for BBB opening. Moreover, presumed non-eloquent cortex
in the right frontal lobe, namely the superior frontal gyrus white matter of the
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), was selected to minimize potential com-
plications in the event of bleeding or mass effect from vasogenic edema. The study
was approved by the Research Ethics Board at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre
(SHSC) and Health Canada. This study was registered with ClinicalTrial.gov
number NCT02986932, and Health Canada number 195168. Prior to enrollment,
all patients and their primary caregivers provided informed consent to the study,
and publication of radiologic images.
Figure 1 outlines the study design. Patients between age 50 and 85 with mild-to-
moderate AD35 with an MMSE score equal to or greater than 18 were eligible for
the study. Detailed inclusion and exclusion criteria are listed in Table 3. In general,
patients were referred to the study by neurologists and geriatricians. They were
excluded if they had any contraindications to MRI, gadolinium or ultrasound
contrast (Definity®), increased risk of bleeding, active intracranial diseases such as
brain tumors or vascular malformations, or significant cardiovascular, pulmonary,
and renal disease. During screening, patients underwent confirmation of their
diagnosis by an expert in cognitive neurology, a pre-surgical anesthetic evaluation,
baseline psychometric tests, and radiographic investigations with CT, MRI, and
[18F]-florbetaben PET CT scans. Twenty-one patients were screened, of which five
entered and completed the study, between March and September 2017.
MRgFUS procedure. We used a focused ultrasound device consisting of 1024
individual transducers with a frequency of 220 kHz (ExAblate Neuro; InSightec
Haifa). The device integrates intraoperative imaging, which was used for interim
evaluations of the patient, and real-time acoustic monitoring to support decision-
making on sonication parameters. On the day of the procedure, a Cosman-Roberts-
Wells (CRW) stereotactic frame was fixed to the patient’s head under local anes-
thetic. The frame was then coupled to the helmet transducer array, with the patient
entering the MRI supine and awake. A safety switch was given to the patient to
abort the procedure in case of discomfort or pain. The patient was examined and
questioned for adverse events after each sonication.
A 3-Tesla MRI (Signa MR750; GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, Wis.) was used to
obtain T1, T2 (fast spin echo), and T2* (gradient echo) weighted images for
surgical planning. A region in the right frontal lobe was then selected for BBB
opening. To minimize the risk, we avoided areas containing sulci and vessels within
two contiguous MRI slices in each of the axial, sagittal, and coronal planes. Once
the target region was identified, patients received a weight-based intravenous
injection of microbubble contrast (Definity®) (4 μl/kg), followed shortly by the
application of low-frequency focused ultrasound to the target. MR thermometry
was used to monitor tissue temperature at the sonicated region in real time. The
sonication parameters were limited by the clinical device hardware and software,
and corresponded to those previously tested in large animal models36.
At each new target, a power ramp test was performed with the first microbubble
injection. This test involves applying short sonications with increasing power in 5%
increments until the device hydrophones detect a sub-harmonic acoustic feedback
from the target, indicating a cavitation. Subsequent sonications are then performed
at 50% of this ‘cavitation threshold’ power. The ramp test was developed from
preclinical studies to determine the optimal power required for safe opening of the
BBB36,37. Sonication volumes covered a rectangular spot approximately 9 mm by 9
mm, comprised of 3-by-3 grid of spots, each 3 mm in diameter. For the last three
patients, given the extent of atrophy on their MRI, a 2-by-2 grid was utilized,
yielding a spot approximately 5 mm by 5 mm. The device electronically steered the
ultrasound through each grid for 50 s total, sonicating each spot with 2 ms on and
28 ms off bursts for 300 ms, with a repetition interval of 2.7 s (duty cycle 0.74%).
For stage 2, performed approximately 1 month following stage 1, the procedure was
repeated, opening the BBB at the original location as well as at an adjacent area,
following the same protocol, but doubling the volume of tissue opened.
After completion of the sonication protocol, a gadolinium-enhanced
T1 sequence was performed to verify definitive evidence of BBB opening. Contrast
enhancement at the targeted region signified the end of the procedure. The patient
was then taken out of the scanner, the stereotactic frame removed, and additional
high-resolution MRI sequences obtained. Patients were admitted to the surgical
short stay unit for overnight observation.
Outcomes. The primary outcomes were clinical and radiographic safety as well as
technical feasibility of reversible and repeated BBB opening. Successful barrier
opening and restoration was determined, respectively, by gadolinium leakage
immediately after sonication and by the absence of enhancement 1 day after
sonication at the target region on T1-weighted contrast images. Safety was mea-
sured by clinical exam during the procedure and at each follow-up, as well as
radiographic examination for any adverse events, including hemorrhage, swelling,
or mass effect. Follow-up visits were scheduled for 1 day, 1 week, and 1 month after
each procedure, as well as 2 months following the second procedure (Fig. 1).
Adverse events were recorded and monitored in a prospective fashion.
Secondary outcomes were Alzheimer’s-specific psychometrics, and exploratory
outcomes included regional changes in [18F]-florbetaben binding on PET.
Psychometric tests administered at 1-day, 1-week, 1-month, and 2-months after
sonication included the MMSE, Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), Alzheimer’s
Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive (ADAS-Cog), NPI-Q, and Alzheimer’s Disease
Cooperative Study Activity of Daily Living Scale (ADCS-ADL).
[18F]-Florbetaben PET CT image acquisition and analysis. PET CT scans to
measure beta-amyloid deposition were performed at baseline and 1 week following
each procedure. A transmission scan followed by a 20-min emission scan (four
frame/5 min each) were acquired on the Phillips Gemini PET CT (3D mode)
starting at 90 min after an 8 mCi ± 20% (n = 14) radiotracer injection of [18F]-
florbetaben. The SUVr was calculated on a voxel-wise basis by dividing the sum-
med PET images by the cerebellar gray matter ROI, consistent with other [18F]-
florbetaben studies29. To derive the cerebellar gray matter ROI, the T1-weighted
MR images were processed with the Freesurfer pipeline (version 5.1; http://surfer.
nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/). The radioactivity in the cerebellar reference region was
extracted after mapping the cerebellar gray matter ROI to the co-registered

 [18F]-florbetaben scans. Image preprocessing was performed with statistical para-
metric mapping, version eight (SPM8, Institute of Neurology, London). PET-to-
PET and MR-to-PET registrations were performed using the normalized mutual
information algorithm, and images were spatially normalized into standard 3D
space relative to the anterior commissure using the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroi-
maging Initiative (ADNI) template38.
To measure the effects of MRgFUS-mediated BBB opening on beta-amyloid
deposition, the sonication ROIs were manually delineated as the contrast enhanced
areas plus adjacent gray and white matter on gadolinium MR images over 6–8
contiguous slices. These ROIs were mapped onto the co-registered T1-weighted
MR and PET scans. Of note, the ROIs for stage 2 were larger than stage 1,
consistent with the larger sonication volumes.
