ABSTRACT
Lyme disease is a tick-borne illness caused by the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi, and approximately 10 to 20% of
patients report persistent symptoms lasting months to years despite appropriate treatment with antibiotics. To gain insights into
the molecular basis of acute Lyme disease and the ensuing development of post-treatment symptoms, we conducted a longitudi-
nal transcriptome study of 29 Lyme disease patients (and 13 matched controls) enrolled at the time of diagnosis and followed for
up to 6 months. The differential gene expression signature of Lyme disease following the acute phase of infection persisted for at
least 3 weeks and had fewer than 44% differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in common with other infectious or noninfectious
syndromes. Early Lyme disease prior to antibiotic therapy was characterized by marked upregulation of Toll-like receptor sig-
naling but lack of activation of the inflammatory T-cell apoptotic and B-cell developmental pathways seen in other acute infec-
tious syndromes. Six months after completion of therapy, Lyme disease patients were found to have 31 to 60% of their pathways
in common with three different immune-mediated chronic diseases. No differential gene expression signature was observed be-
tween Lyme disease patients with resolved illness to those with persistent symptoms at 6 months post-treatment. The identifica-
tion of a sustained differential gene expression signature in Lyme disease suggests that a panel of selected human host-based bio-
markers may address the need for sensitive clinical diagnostics during the “window period” of infection prior to the appearance
of a detectable antibody response and may also inform the development of new therapeutic targets.
IMPORTANCE Lyme disease is the most common tick-borne infection in the United States, and some patients report lingering
symptoms lasting months to years despite antibiotic treatment. To better understand the role of the human host response in
acute Lyme disease and the development of post-treatment symptoms, we conducted the first longitudinal gene expression (tran-
scriptome) study of patients enrolled at the time of diagnosis and followed up for up to 6 months after treatment. Importantly,
we found that the gene expression signature of early Lyme disease is distinct from that of other acute infectious diseases and per-
sists for at least 3 weeks following infection. This study also uncovered multiple previously undescribed pathways and genes that
may be useful in the future as human host biomarkers for diagnosis and that constitute potential targets for the development of
new therapies.

L
yme disease, a systemic tick-borne infection caused by the bac-
terial spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi, is the most common
vector-borne disease in the United States and Europe (1). Over
30,000 cases in the United States are reported annually to the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) (http://www-
.cdc.gov/lyme/stats/humancases.html). However, actual preva-
lence estimates are at least 10 times as high because of underre-
porting of cases and overreliance on insensitive diagnostic tests in
the acute phase of infection (2). Lyme disease has been associated
with arthritis, meningitis, facial palsy, and (rarely) myocarditis
resulting in sudden death (3). Most patients treated with appro-
priate antibiotics recover rapidly and completely, but a minority
of patients develop persistent symptoms correlating with dissem-
inated disease, a greater severity of illness at presentation, and
delayed antibiotic therapy (4). The proportion of Lyme disease
patients with persistent symptoms varies greatly, from 0 to 50%,
depending on the cohort of interest and the case definition used
(4, 5). When lingering or recurrent symptoms are associated with
a functional decline and persist for greater than 6 months, patients
are considered to meet clinical criteria for post-treatment Lyme
disease syndrome (PTLDS) (6), although the exact molecular
mechanisms underlying this condition remain unknown.

 cytes constitute the first line of defense, engulfing the spirochete
and producing Th1-type proinflammatory cytokines. Spirochetal
lipoproteins can directly stimulate the B-cell response, and both
lipidated and nonlipidated proteins trigger T-cell-dependent hu-
moral responses. Decreased Th1 and increased Th17 responses
have also been shown to play a role in the development of post-
treatment Lyme disease symptoms during the chronic phase of the
illness (8, 9). However, with the exception of antibiotic-refractory
Lyme arthritis, very few studies have looked at the molecular
mechanisms underlying persistent symptomatology in treated
Lyme disease patients, and all to date have used targeted ap-
proaches assaying specific cytokine levels (8–10). The overall
global and temporal pathways involved in human clinical infec-
tion with B. burgdorferi remain to be elucidated.
In this study, we applied next-generation sequencing of pe-
ripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) to investigate the
transcriptomes of 29 patients with acute Lyme disease longitudi-
nally from the time of diagnosis to 6 months post-treatment and
those of 13 matched controls. We performed network and path-
way analyses in order to gain insights into the molecular mecha-
nisms underpinning acute Lyme disease and post-treatment
symptoms and to discover potential diagnostic biomarkers.
RESULTS
Patient enrollment, sample collection, and transcriptome anal-
ysis. This study included a cohort of 29 patients with acute Lyme
disease and 13 matched controls without acute illness. Transcrip-
tome profiling by RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) and pathway anal-
ysis were performed with PBMC samples collected at three time
points, V1 (time of acute Lyme disease diagnosis and prior to
starting antibiotic therapy), V2 (immediately after the completion
of a 3-week course of doxycycline treatment), and V5 (6 months
after the completion of therapy) (Fig. 1). Approximately 73 (� 43
[standard deviation]) million reads were generated per sample,
and on average, 64.9% of the genes had nonzero counts (see Fig.
S1 in the supplemental material).
No significant differences in age, sex, ethnicity, or preexisting
comorbidities were noted between Lyme disease patients and con-
trols (Table 1). Two-tiered antibody testing for Lyme disease with
whole-cell lysates was positive in 20 (71.4%) of 28 patients tested,
with 14/28 (50%) patients testing positive at the pretreatment visit
and an additional 6/28 (21.4%) seroconverting during treatment
(Table 1). The 29 Lyme disease patients were enrolled in a single
season at the same geographic location, an outpatient clinic in
suburban Maryland. At the 6-month follow-up visit (V5), 15 pa-
tients had fully recovered from the infection while 13 experienced
persistent symptoms post-treatment, defined as new-onset fa-
tigue, widespread musculoskeletal pain involving �3 joints,
and/or cognitive dysfunction (11); 1 patient was lost to follow-up.
Of the 13 patients with persistent symptoms, 4 were diagnosed
with PTLDS on the basis of a recently proposed standardized case
definition that included a documented functional decline at 6
months as a key criterion (6).
Six (40%) of the 15 patients with resolved illness and 6 (46%)
of the 13 with persistent symptoms presented with early dissemi-
nated disease consisting of multiple erythema migrans (EM) le-
sions at the time of diagnosis (see Table S1 in the supplemental
material). The average duration of acute illness, defined as the
time from onset of EM rash and/or influenza-like symptoms to
study enrollment and initiation of doxycycline therapy, was sig-
nificantly longer in patients developing persistent symptoms
(9.7 days for non-PTLDS and 19.3 days for PTLDS) than in pa-
tients with resolved illness (5.2 days) (P � 0.036) (see Table S1 in
the supplemental material). In addition, the number of symptoms
was significantly higher at all time points in patients with persis-
tent symptoms than in those with resolved illness (P � 0.04) (see
Table S1 in the supplemental material).
Lyme disease gene expression signature. We initially com-
pared the transcriptomes of 29 Lyme disease patients at the time of
diagnosis (V1) with those of 13 matched controls. This analysis
revealed a total of 1,235 differentially expressed genes (DEGs)
(Fig. 2A; Table 2). Approximately 69% (n � 847) of the DEGs
were upregulated, and 31% (n � 388) were downregulated
(Fig. 2A). Three weeks after diagnosis (V2), at the time of comple-
tion of a standard course of antibiotic treatment, 1,060 DEGs were
found in both Lyme disease patients and controls, with 63% (n �
670) upregulated and 37% (n � 390) downregulated. Sixty-
two percent of the DEGs occurred at both the V1 and V2 time
points (Fig. 2B). At 6 months after treatment completion (V5), the
Lyme disease transcriptome did not fully return to the baseline
relative to controls, with 686 DEGs, 54% (n � 373) upregulated
and 46% (n � 313) downregulated. Partially overlapping clusters
were observed for each sample category (V1, V2, V5, and controls)
by principal component analysis (PCA) (Fig. 2C).
We then calculated differential gene expression between sub-
jects with single versus multiple disseminated EM lesions and be-
tween seropositive and seronegative subjects (Table 2). While no
DEGs were identified on the basis of single versus multiple lesions,

 four DEGs were found to be upregulated in seronegative Lyme
disease patients relative to those who were seropositive, namely,
HLA-DQA1, HLA-DQB1, HLA-DRB5, and NSA2 (see Fig. S3 in
the supplemental material).
Pathway analyses of the Lyme disease transcriptome. Path-
way analysis of Lyme disease DEGs revealed predicted activation
of inflammatory response, immune cell trafficking, and hemato-
logic system pathways at V1, as expected in the setting of the acute
phase of an infection such as Lyme disease (Fig. 2D and 3). How-
ever, the same categories also remained activated following the
completion of antibiotic treatment and the clinical resolution of
symptoms (V2 and V5), with the general pattern of gene expres-
sion more inhibitory at V5 (Fig. 3).
Eight, 10, and 4 of the top 10 predicted canonical pathways at
V1, V2, and V5, respectively, were directly related to the host
immune response (Fig. 2E). The eIF2 signaling pathway, modu-
lating translational initiation and elongation, was found to be sig-
nificantly downregulated at all three time points (Fig. 2E; see Fig.
S4 and Table S2 in the supplemental material). In contrast,
TREM1-mediated activation of a Th1 proinflammatory response
through upregulation of the factors DAP12, interleukin-6 (IL-6),
and IL-12 was prominent at only V1 and V2 (Fig. 2E; see Fig. S4 in
the supplemental material). Multiple Toll-like receptors (TLRs)
associated with inflammation and apoptosis were also found to be
significantly upregulated at V1 and V2 (TLR1, -2, -4, -7, and -8)
(see Fig. S4 in the supplemental material).
The most important upstream regulators in Lyme disease at V1
and V2 were found to be proinflammatory cytokines and markers
(CSF2, gamma interferon [IFN-�], IL-1�, IL-6, tumor necrosis
factor alpha [TNF-�]), anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-
10), the cell surface marker CD40L, transforming growth factor
�1, the signal transduction mediator TICAM, the transcriptional
regulator NF-�B, and the immunoglobulin complex (Fig. 2F),
with TNF-� shown to be a master regulator of eIF2 signaling,

involved in the regulation of gene expression (MYCN, HOX-A7,

Comparison of acute Lyme disease with other infections. We
compared our V1 RNA-Seq data, derived from patients with acute
Lyme disease, to 12 available, previously published transcriptome
data sets from cell culture models of in vitro infection or from
patients with acute viral and bacterial infections other than Lyme
disease (Fig. 4). Unsurprisingly, the greatest overlap in shared
DEGs (44%) was observed with in vitro B. burgdorferi infection of
human PBMCs (44%), followed by infection of human endothe-
lial cells (29%), human neuroblastoma cells (13%), or primary
monkey glial cells (11%) (Fig. 4A). We also compared DEGs from
acute Lyme disease patients with those corresponding to human

Downloaded from 
 by the fungal pathogen Candida albicans, or infected by two tick-
borne bacterial agents, i.e., Francisella tularensis (tularemia) and
Anaplasma phagocytophilum (anaplasmosis). Interestingly, stim-
ulation of PBMCs by LPS (39%) resulted in a greater overlap of
shared DEGs than in vitro infection with C. albicans (27%), F. tu-
larensis (28%), or A. phagocytophilum (15%) (Fig. 4A). Next, we
compared the acute Lyme disease transcriptome at V1 to tran-
scriptomes corresponding to other acute infectious syndromes
(Fig. 4A and B). Patients with acute influenza had 35% of their
DEGs in common with Lyme disease patients, while they had only
28, 26, and 21% of their DEGs in common with patients with
bacteremia due to Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneu-
moniae, and Escherichia coli, respectively.
To determine if these infectious diseases have pathways in
common, we then compared the top canonical pathways signifi-
cantly involved in acute Lyme disease at V1 (P � 0.05) with those
corresponding to other clinical infectious diseases or in vitro cell
culture models of infection. The greatest number of shared path-
ways was observed with S. pneumoniae bacteremia (82%) and in
vitro F. tularensis (80%)- and C. albicans (78%)-infected cell cul-
tures. Strikingly, downregulation of eIF2 signaling was restricted
to Lyme disease and not found in other infectious diseases or in
vitro cell culture infection models (Fig. 4B). In contrast, TREM1
and TLR pathways were activated in all five infections, whereas
upregulation of IFN signaling pathways was predicted in only
Lyme disease and influenza. B-cell development and downregula-
tion of calcium-induced T-cell apoptosis, prominent in other viral
and bacterial infections, were not found to be significant pathways
in acute Lyme disease (Fig. 4B).
Pathway analysis of Lyme disease patients at 6 months post-
treatment and comparison with chronic disease syndromes. We
next compared the PBMC transcriptome from all treated Lyme
disease patients at V5 (both resolved illness and persistent symp-
toms) to publicly available transcriptome data sets from patients
diagnosed with chronic illnesses that have some symptoms in
common with PTLDS, including chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS),
systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and rheumatoid arthritis
(RA). The percentages of shared DEGs and pathways ranged from
9 to 18% and from 31 to 60%, respectively (Fig. 4C). Inhibition of
eIF2 signaling was common to Lyme disease, SLE, and (to a lesser
extent) RA (Fig. 4D; see Fig. S5 in the supplemental material).
Glutathione-mediated detoxification and IL-6 signaling pathways
were found to be specific to Lyme disease patients. No additional
differences were revealed by subset analyses of Lyme disease pa-
tients manifesting persistent symptoms (non-PTLDS and PTLDS)
and patients with these chronic illnesses.
Comparison of differential gene expression between Lyme
disease patients with resolved versus persistent disease. No
DEGs were significantly expressed at any single time point be-
tween patients with resolved Lyme disease (n � 15) and patients
with persistent symptoms, including both non-PTLDS and
PTLDS patients (n � 13) (Table 2). A single DEG (GPR15) was
found at V1 when patients with resolved Lyme disease (n � 15)
were compared with patients with PTLDS (n � 4). When all of the
time points were combined, a total of four different DEGs overall
were identified in Lyme disease patients with persistent symptoms
(non-PTLDS and/or PTLDS) compared to those with resolved
disease, i.e., MIAT, CCDC163P, ZNF266, and GPR15.
DISCUSSION
We provide the first transcriptome analysis of B. burgdorferi infec-
tion in Lyme disease patients, revealing a gene signature that per-
sisted for at least 3 weeks following the acute phase of infection
and had fewer than 44% DEGs in common with other infectious

 or noninfectious syndromes. Notably, no differences in gene ex-
pression were observed between Lyme disease patients with re-
solved illness and those with persistent symptoms at 6 months,
although larger cohort studies are needed to confirm this finding.
The identification of a distinct and sustained transcriptome signa-
ture in early Lyme disease may facilitate the development and
validation of human gene expression biomarker panels to im-
prove diagnostic testing in the future, in parallel with other pub-
lished studies investigating cytokine (12) or metabolic (13) bio-
signatures.
To define the longitudinal transcriptome profile of patients
with acute Lyme disease at 0 weeks, 3 weeks, and �6 months,
unbiased RNA-Seq analysis was employed with the goal of inves-
tigating the molecular basis of early and convalescent-phase Lyme
disease. Potential advantages of RNA-Seq relative to microarrays
include detection of low-abundance transcripts, a broader dy-
namic range in detecting fold changes in gene expression, unbi-
ased detection of novel isoforms and transcripts, and elimination
of hybridization-based limitations such as background noise, sat-
uration, and probe redundancy (14). However, the utility of RNA-
Seq data is dependent on a number of factors, including the num-
ber and quality of samples, sequencing depth, and designated
thresholds for gene expression and differential analyses. In this
study, we estimated the statistical power as 98% when analyzing

 samples at all three time points combined, 78% for samples col-
lected at a single time point, and only 62% when considering a
stratification of the Lyme disease cohort according to PTLDS sta-
tus, serology, or the presence of disseminated lesions (15).
The finding of a profound and sustained change in the tran-
scriptome of acute Lyme disease patients refutes the idea that
treatment and resolution of the infection result in a prompt return
to a transcriptional baseline, as typically seen in the acute phase of
other infections (16). In addition, failure to return to a transcrip-
tome baseline cannot be accounted for solely by patients with
persistent symptoms, given that no DEGs were found comparing
Lyme disease patients with resolved illness to those with persistent
symptoms (Table 2). Persistent transcriptional changes may be
characteristic of not only Lyme disease but also a number of other
infections. For example, viral clearance in hepatitis C patients did
not result in normalization of the baseline transcriptome (17). To

Downloaded from 
 our knowledge, this is first time that sustained changes in the
human host transcriptome have been reported for a bacterial in-
fection after treatment with appropriate antibiotics. Persistence of
such a signature for at least 3 weeks following infection suggests
that a clinical diagnostic test for acute Lyme disease based on host
gene expression is feasible. Such a test would also directly address
the current diagnostic gap created by the “window period” be-
tween acute Lyme disease infection and the subsequent appear-
ance of detectable antibody.
Infection by B. burgdorferi drives a complex immune response
with robust inflammation and overt clinical signs and symptoms
in early stages of the disease (7). The eIF2 signaling pathway,
found to be downregulated here during all stages of Lyme disease,
plays a central role in protein synthesis in response to cellular
stress (18). Intracellular bacterial pathogens such as Legionella
pneumophila encode effectors that actively disrupt and downregu-
late the eIF2 signaling pathway (19). However, Borrelia spiro-
chetes are not known to enter cells during infection in vivo, nor are
they thought to express such effectors (20). Consistent with a pre-
vious report (21), the eIF2 pathway in this study was also found to
be downregulated in SLE as well as PTLDS patients. Inhibitors of
the eIF2 pathway have been reported as potential therapeutic
drugs for inflammatory bowel disease, and further studies are
needed to assess whether eIF2 inhibitors may constitute potential
targets for inflammatory sequelae of Lyme disease (22). Neverthe-
less, it remains to be determined whether inhibition of the eIF2
pathway in Lyme disease patients is caused directly by Borrelia-
mediated immune dysregulation or is strictly a host response
mechanism to limit tissue injury.
The prominent TREM1 signaling in acute Lyme disease ob-
served here is consistent with previously published in vitro gene
expression data of B. burgdorferi infection of human neural and
primary monkey glial cell lines (23). TREM1 acts as an amplifier of
the immune and inflammatory response in vivo (24), and modu-
lation of TREM1 has been shown to impact a number of inflam-
matory conditions, including septic shock, and acute dengue virus
infection (25, 26). Our data also showed upregulation of more
TLRs (TLR2, TLR4, TLR7, and TLR8) in acute Lyme disease than
previously described (27). This broad upregulation is likely to be
indirect, reflecting a general increase in TLR regulatory activity
rather than direct association of TLRs with B. burgdorferi proteins.
In the present study, TNF-� was predicted to be a common up-
stream regulator of the eIF2, TREM1, and TLR signaling path-
ways. Notably, anti-TNF-� therapy has been proposed to reduce
inflammation in the Jarisch-Herxheimer response to Borrelia re-
currentis infection (28), and treatment was previously reported to
be clinically efficacious in 4/4 patients with antibiotic-refractory
Lyme arthritis (29).
Comparisons with 15 previously published transcriptome data
sets found that the greatest overlap of DEGs (44%) was with the
transcriptome of PBMCs stimulated with B. burgdorferi in vitro.
Although this observation is to be expected, given the same infec-
tious agent and cell type, the only partial overlap likely reflects
differences between in vivo or in vitro B. burgdorferi infections and
underscores the critical importance of analyzing “real-life” clini-
cal samples from patients in studies of disease pathogenesis. Given
the lymphocytic infiltrates characteristic of Lyme disease, in con-
trast with the suppurative lesions common to many bacterial in-
fections (1), it is perhaps not surprising that the percentage of
DEGs in Lyme disease patients also found in patients with acute
influenza was greater than that of DEGs also found in patients
with other bacterial infections. Among bacterial infections, infec-
tion with S. pneumoniae had the highest number of top canonical
pathways in common with acute Lyme disease, consistent with
similarities in virulence factors shared by S. pneumoniae and
B. burgdorferi, such as lipoproteins, that produce shared IgM-
mediated immunological responses (30).
Importantly, Lyme disease patients did not show any changes
in the calcium-dependent T-cell apoptosis pathway, in contrast to
the marked downregulation observed in other bacterial and viral
diseases (Fig. 4B). In addition, an absence of significant DEGs
linked to B-cell development in Lyme disease relative to other
infections was observed. These findings suggest that Lyme disease
may be associated with a smaller proportion of B and T cells in
peripheral blood than other diseases. Interestingly, suppression of
long-lived humoral responses has been observed in a mouse
model of Borrelia infection (31). The absence of DEGs corre-
sponding to B-cell maturation may also potentially explain why
prior infection with B. burgdorferi is associated with a serological
response yet does not appear to confer immunity to reinfection.
Certain alleles of HLA genes have been previously reported to be
associated with serological responses to Lyme disease infection
(32). Here we found that upregulation of certain HLA genes
(HLA-DQA1, HLA-DQB1, HLA-DRB5) is associated with serone-
gativity in Lyme disease and may thus constitute potential diag-
nostic biomarkers for seronegative patients.
Following the acute phase of infection, recent treatment trials
among patients with EM have estimated that approximately 10 to
20% of patients treated for Lyme disease experience lingering
symptoms that may progress to PTLDS, although the incidence
can be as high at 50% (4). The pathogenetic mechanisms of
PTLDS remain unknown, but autoantigens and/or central ner-
vous system sensitization have been postulated to play a role (10,
33–35). In our study, the relatively large proportion of post-
treatment Lyme disease patients with persistent symptoms of fa-
tigue, widespread musculoskeletal pain, and/or cognitive dys-
function (13 [46.4%] of 28) can be potentially accounted for by
more stringent enrollment criteria at the time of presentation (re-
quiring the presence of EM and concurrent influenza-like symp-
toms rather than EM alone). This may have resulted in the selec-
tion of patients with more severe disease and thus with an
increased likelihood of persistent symptoms (36). Of note, ac-
cording to the proposed formal case definition for PTLDS, which
requires a functional decline in patients in addition to lingering
symptoms, only 4 (14.3%) of our 28 patients met all of the criteria,
within the range of the 10 to 20% frequency reported in the liter-
ature (4).
Notably, Lyme disease at 6 months post-treatment (V5) had 60
and 31% of their predicted pathways overall in common with SLE
and RA, respectively. Circulating immune complexes have been
identified as features common to all three conditions (37, 38).
Symptoms of fatigue and cognitive impairment occur in a variety
of chronic syndromes, including SLE, CFS, and PTLDS. Although
some pathways were common to Lyme disease at V5 and CFS,
melatonin signaling, prominent in CFS, was not predicted to be
involved in Lyme disease (Fig. 4D). As melatonin is a hormone
that regulates the circadian rhythms of the sleep-wake cycle and
thus is strongly linked to fatigue, the absence of increased melato-
nin signaling suggests that the fatigue in Lyme disease patients
with persistent symptoms is related to a different mechanism.

 Overall, our results, showing only 18% of the DEGs and 34% of
the pathways common to CFS and Lyme disease, are consistent
with a proteomic study of cerebrospinal fluid that clearly discrim-
inates between the two conditions (39).
Transcriptome analysis of Lyme disease patients with persis-
tent symptoms (non-PTLDS and/or PTLDS) versus those with
resolved illness revealed an absence of DEGs at each of the three
time points, with the sole exception of a single gene (GPR15),
which was upregulated at V1 in PTLDS patients relative to con-
trols. Possible explanations for the overall lack of observed differ-
ences include (i) lack of statistical power from low sample num-
bers, (ii) sampling at designated time points instead of during
periods of peak symptomatology, and (iii) that transcriptome
profiling of PBMCs in blood is insufficient to discriminate be-
tween Lyme disease patients with persistent symptoms and those
with resolved illness. Larger studies with increased sampling res-
olution are needed to establish whether there are indeed any de-
tectable differences in gene expression between these two groups.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient information. Patient enrollment, collection of clinical data and
biological samples, and analysis of clinical samples by transcriptome pro-
filing were done under protocols approved by the Institutional Review
Boards of Johns Hopkins University and the University of California, San
Francisco. Written informed consent was received from all participants
prior to inclusion in this study.
All 29 participants with Lyme disease included in this study presented
with a physician-documented EM rash of �5 cm and concurrent
influenza-like symptoms that included at least one of the following; fever,
chills, fatigue, headache, and/or new muscle or joint pains. At the time of
enrollment, all of the participants with Lyme disease were treatment naive
and subsequently underwent 3 weeks of doxycycline therapy between the
first and second follow-up visits. All 29 subjects with Lyme disease were
enrolled at the same geographic location (an outpatient clinic in Mary-
land) in a single season, from 1 May to 23 November 2009, with follow-up
visits 3 weeks and 6 months after the first visit. Controls were matched by
age and gender and enrolled from the same physician practice as case
participants and across different seasons to account for seasonal varia-
tions in the transcriptome. Two-tier antibody testing for Lyme disease by
whole-cell sonicate enzyme immunoassay, followed by IgM/IgG Western
immunoblot assays, was performed for all patients and controls by a clin-
ical reference laboratory (Quest Diagnostics). Seropositivity was assessed
according to established CDC criteria (40) by the investigators (A.R. and
J.A.) who enrolled and provided clinical care for the patients enrolled in
this study. All control subjects were required to have a negative Lyme
disease antibody test in order to be enrolled in this study. We screened
both patients and controls prior to enrollment for a history of chronic
fatigue, fibromyalgia, autoimmune, immunodeficiency, neurologic, psy-
chiatric, and malignancy disorders, in which case they were excluded from
the study. Prospective case patients and controls were also excluded if they
had a prior documented history of Lyme disease and/or if they had previ-
ously received the Lyme disease vaccine.
Controls were enrolled primarily during the winter and spring sea-
sons, while most Lyme disease patients were enrolled in summer during
the peak season for tick bites, a difference that was statistically significant
(P � 0.03) (Table 1). Nonetheless, the differences in seasonal sampling
did not result in gene expression bias, as shown by the absence of seasonal
clustering by PCA of the overall gene expression of the 13 controls (see Fig.
S2b in the supplemental material). In addition, an intragroup comparison
of eight controls sampled during the winter and five controls sampled
during other seasons did not yield any significant DEGs (Table 2).
PBMCs from whole-blood samples at V1 (the acute phase of infection,
prior to initiation of antibiotic treatment), V2 (3 weeks later, at the time of
treatment completion), and V5 (6 months following treatment comple-
tion) were analyzed in this study (Fig. 1A). V2 and V5 were specifically
chosen for analysis because fever and rash from acute Lyme disease typi-
cally resolve by completion of treatment (V2), while chronic persistent
symptoms are clinically apparent after 6 months (V5).
The presence of persistent symptoms in Lyme disease patients at V5
was assessed by using a standardized case definition proposed by the In-
fectious Diseases Society of America (6, 11) that incorporates the presence
of at least one of the following: new-onset fatigue, widespread musculo-
skeletal pain, or cognitive dysfunction. For a diagnosis of PTLDS, patients
were also required to have a composite score of �45.00 on four subscales
of the SF-36, a measurement of health-related quality of life (6) (Fig. 1B).
The chi-square test was used to evaluate the statistical significance of dif-
ferences between independent samples in one or more categorical vari-
ables, while Welch’s t test was used for continuous variables.
Sample processing. PBMCs were isolated from fresh whole blood
with Ficoll (Ficoll-Paque Plus; GE Healthcare), and total RNA was ex-
tracted from 107 PBMCs with TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies). mRNA
was isolated with the Oligotex mRNA minikit (Qiagen). The ScriptSeq
RNA-Seq library preparation kit (Epicentre) was used to generate RNA-
Seq libraries according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Libraries were
sequenced as 100-bp paired-end runs on a HiSeq 2500 (Illumina). One
hundred samples from the first cohort (29 patients at three time points
and 13 control subjects, matched by age, sex, and geography) were mixed
and blindly processed in three batches. Three samples, 01-36_V2, 01-
42_V2, and 01-51_V1, were not included in the pooled analysis because of
insufficient read counts and transcriptome coverage (see Fig. S1 in the
supplemental material). No batch effect was observed by PCA of the
global expression of all 25,278 genes (see Fig. S6 in the supplemental
material).
Next-generation sequencing data analysis. Paired-end reads were
mapped to the human genome (hg19), followed by annotation of exons
and calculation of FPKM (fragments per kilobase of exon per million
fragments mapped) values for all 25,278 expressed genes with version 2 of
the TopHat-Cufflinks pipeline (41). Differential expression of genes was
calculated by using the variance modeling at the observational level trans-
formation (42), which applies precision weights to the matrix count, fol-
lowed by linear modeling with the Limma package (43). Genes were con-
sidered to be differentially expressed when the change was greater than
�1.5-fold, the P value was �0.05, and the adjusted P value (or false-
discovery rate, FDR) was �0.1% (44). Pathway and network analyses of
the transcriptome data were performed with Ingenuity Pathway Analysis
(IPA) software (Qiagen) (45). The molecule activity predictor tool in the
IPA software was used to predict the upstream and/or downstream acti-
vation or inhibition of a given pathway. The P value of the enrichment
score was used to evaluate the significance of the overlap between ob-
served and predicted gene sets, while the activation Z score was used to
assess the match between observed and predicted patterns of upregulation
and downregulation. The statistical significance of the difference in gene
expression levels was determined with Welch’s t test for independent sam-
ples by two-group comparisons. The statistical power for the transcrip-
tome study was determined according to the algorithm developed by Hart
et al. (15), with the use of a generalized linear model on normalized FPKM
data instead of a negative binomial distribution on raw gene count data.
The generalized linear model has been reported to be more reliable for
differential analysis of data sets with small sample sizes (41, 43).

the Robust Multichip Average algorithm (53). Differential expression was
calculated with the Limma package (43), which is applicable for analysis of
both RNA-Seq and microarray data (42, 43). Genes were considered to be
differentially expressed when the change was greater than �1.5-fold, the
P value was �0.05, and the FDR was �0.1%, in accordance with conven-
