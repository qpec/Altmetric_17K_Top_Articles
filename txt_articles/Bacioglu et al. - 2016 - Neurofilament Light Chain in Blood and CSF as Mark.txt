SUMMARY
A
majority
of
current
disease-modifying
thera-
peutic approaches for age-related neurodegenera-
tive diseases target their characteristic proteopathic
lesions (a-synuclein, Tau, Ab). To monitor such
treatments, fluid biomarkers reflecting the underly-
ing disease process are crucial. We found robust in-
creases of neurofilament light chain (NfL) in CSF
and blood in murine models of a-synucleinopathies,
tauopathy, and b-amyloidosis. Blood and CSF NfL
levels were strongly correlated, and NfL increases
coincided with the onset and progression of the
corresponding proteopathic lesions in brain. Exper-
imental induction of a-synuclein lesions increased
CSF and blood NfL levels, while blocking Ab lesions
attenuated the NfL increase. Consistently, we also
found NfL increases in CSF and blood of human
a-synucleinopathies, tauopathies, and Alzheimer’s
disease. Our results suggest that CSF and particu-
larly blood NfL can serve as a reliable and easily
accessible biomarker to monitor disease progres-
sion and treatment response in mouse models and
potentially in human proteopathic neurodegenera-
tive diseases.
INTRODUCTION
Proteopathic neurodegenerative diseases are the most common
chronic and debilitating disorders of the aging population. They
are characterized by pathological hallmarks in brain including re-
gion-specific neurodegeneration and deposition of aggregated
proteins, namely Tau and amyloid-b (Ab) in Alzheimer’s disease
(AD), a-synuclein (aS) in idiopathic Parkinson’s disease (IPD), de-
mentia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and multiple system atrophy
(MSA), and Tau in progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and
corticobasal syndrome (CBS). The proteopathic lesions develop
at least a decade before the onset of the first symptoms, and
this preclinical period is considered the most promising inter-
vention time for disease-modifying therapies (Del Tredici and
Braak, 2012; Jack and Holtzman, 2013; Marek et al., 2008; Sperl-
ing et al., 2014). To tackle diseases at such early stages, bio-
markers that reflect the impact of disease-modifying treatments
and that are easily accessible—ideally in blood—are of utmost
importance.
Given the difficulty of identifying patients at such preclinical
disease stages, well-characterized mouse models hold great
translational
value.
In
such
genetically
induced
models,
biomarker changes during disease progression or in response
to therapy can be directly validated with the brain pathology,
thus avoiding the diagnostic uncertainty and interfering comor-
bidities present in humans. Moreover, the homogeneity of genet-
ically defined mouse models minimizes the interindividual vari-
ability and allows the use of mice even in a cross-sectional
study design (Barten et al., 2011; Maia et al., 2013, 2015).
A putative biomarker candidate to monitor disease progres-
sion and disease-modifying treatments is the neurofilament light
chain protein (NfL). Together with the neurofilament medium
(NfM) and heavy (NfH) subunits, NfL is one of the scaffolding pro-
teins of the neural cytoskeleton, with important roles in axonal
and dendritic branching and growth (Le
´ pinoux-Chambaud and
Eyer, 2013; Petzold, 2005). Following CNS axonal damage, NfL
levels in the CSF increase and thus are considered as a promising

 biomarker of axonal injury in multiple neurological disorders
(Kuhle et al., 2015; Neselius et al., 2012; Petzold, 2005). More
recently, CSF NfL has also been reported to be elevated in neuro-
degenerative conditions such as AD, PD, frontotemporal demen-
tia, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (Ba
¨ ckstro
¨ m et al., 2015; Lu
et al., 2015; Scherling et al., 2014; Zetterberg et al., 2016).
Here we studied NfL changes in blood, CSF, and brain of a va-
riety of mouse models of proteopathic neurodegenerative dis-
eases. In two murine models of a-synucleinopathy (A53T-aS
and A30P-aS tg mice), a model of tauopathy (P301S-Tau tg
mice) and a model of cerebral b-amyloidosis (APPPS1 tg
mice), we observed robust and early increases of NfL levels in
CSF and, remarkably, also blood. Interestingly, in all tg lines
high NfL levels in bodily fluids coincided with related pathological
changes in the brain. To mechanistically investigate the associ-
ation between NfL changes in bodily fluids and proteopathic le-
sions in brain, we experimentally induced or blocked aS and Ab
lesions, respectively. Finally, we show increased NfL levels in
CSF and also blood of representative human a-synucleinopa-
thies, tauopathies, and b-amyloidosis. Our findings suggest
that CSF and plasma NfL may serve not only as progression
marker but also as a biomarker for treatment response in proteo-
pathic neurodegenerative diseases.
RESULTS
Proteopathic Lesions in Transgenic Mouse Brains
To examine onset and progression of brain pathology in A53T-
aS, P301S-Tau, and APPPS1 tg mice, brains and spinal cords
from different age groups were stained with antibodies against
phosphorylated aS, phosphorylated tau, and Ab, respectively.
While 2- to 4-month-old A53T-aS mice did not yet show any
aS inclusions, at the age of 6–8 months first lesions became
apparent, coinciding with the time of early motor signs (Fig-
ure 1A). Thereafter, aS inclusions dramatically increased, and
at 8–10 months of age A53T-aS mice became severely impaired
and the animals had to be sacrificed. At that time the majority of
brainstem including midbrain, pons and medulla, and spinal cord
nuclei exhibited aS inclusions (Figure 1A). The remaining brain
regions were largely free of aS inclusions.
In P301S-Tau mice, Tau deposits first appeared in the brain-
stem but did not become prominent until 10–12 months of age.
Tau inclusions further increased and mice revealed motor signs
at 14–16 months of age when they were analyzed (Figure 1B).
At that time Tau inclusions were present in most brainstem and
spinal cord nuclei. The remaining brain regions were largely
free of Tau inclusions.
In APPPS1 mice, Ab deposits were already present in the
3 month group, where they were restricted to forebrain regions
(mainly neocortex and hippocampus). At 12 and 18 months of
age, Ab depositswerefound throughouttheentirebrain, including
brainstem and spinal cord (Figure 1C). No obvious neurological
signs were observed in this line up to 18 months of age.
Transgenic Mouse Models Reveal Increased NfL in CSF
and Blood
In all three examined mouse models an increase in CSF NfL
levels was already observed in asymptomatic stages, and the
levels and timing were related to the development of the brain le-
sions and severity of the neurological signs. Plasma NfL levels
were 1/30–1/40 of the CSF levels (Figure 2). The specificity of
the assay for murine CSF and plasma NfL was demonstrated
by
the
analysis
of
NfL-deficient
mice
(see
Experimental
Procedures).
In the A53T-aS mice, a significant, more than 10-fold increase
in CSF NfL over non-tg controls was already observed in non-
symptomatic 2- to 4-month-old mice. Thereafter NfL levels
increased dramatically and in 8- to 10-month-old symptomatic
mice NfL levels were approximately 1,000-fold higher than in
non-tg age-matched controls. Plasma NfL did not yet exhibit a
significant increase at 2–4 months of age, but an over 100-fold
increase was noted in the A53T-aS mice at the symptomatic
stage (Figure 2).
P301S-Tau mice exhibited the first significant increase in CSF
NfL levels at 10–12 months of age compared to controls. At 14–
16 months of age, when the mice presented the first phenotyp-
ical signs, the increase was 20-fold over non-tg control mice.
Plasma levels became significantly different at 10–12 months
of age also before the mice showed any motor signs (Figure 2).
Consistently, such findings were also observed in APPPS1
mice with significantly higher CSF NfL levels over non-tg controls
at both 3 and 12 months of age. Overall, the absolute NfL increase
was less than that observed in the A53T-aS and P301S-Tau
mice. At 18 months of age the increase in the APPPS1 mice
was 10-fold over the age-matched non-tg controls. Plasma NfL
appeared also increased at 18 months compared to non-tg con-
trols (Figure 2).
CSF and plasma NfL levels showed a significant positive cor-
relation in all the mouse models whether assessed over all age
groups or within same age groups (see Figure S1 available on-
line). Moreover, CSF and plasma NfL correlated strongly with
the brain pathology as exemplified in the 6- to 8-month-old
A53T-aS mice (Figure S1).
To examine whether NfL levels also change in the brain, brain
levels of NfL were measured in aged A53T-aS, P301S-Tau, and
APPPS1 mice. However, no significant changes were detected
(Figure S2), although histological analyses revealed the ex-
pected and previously described NfL-positive neuritic abnormal-
ities in brainstem (for A53T-aS and P301S-Tau mice) and fore-
brain (APPPS1 mice) consistent with axonal pathology (Figures
S3 and S4) (Leroy et al., 2007; Martin et al., 2006; Wirths et al.,
2006). Overall, total NfL levels in wild-type (WT) brain were
approximately 25,000-fold higher than in CSF and partially eluci-
date why even a 100- to 1,000-fold increase in CSF NfL is not
easily detectable when total brain NfL is analyzed.
Induction of aS Lesions Increases NfL in CSF and Blood
of A30P-aS Mice
To confirm NfL changes in CSF and blood of aS tg mice, we used
a second aS tg mouse model (A30P-aS) that develops pathology
more slowly than the A53T-aS line. Moreover, to explore the
mechanistic link of the NfL changes in CSF and blood with the
occurrence of the aS inclusions and related neurodegeneration,
seeded induction of aS lesions was performed (Figure 3A) (Luk
et al., 2012; Mougenot et al., 2012; Schweighauser et al.,
2015). To this end, A30P-aS mice either were inoculated with

 brain extract derived from aged symptomatic A30P-aS tg mice
(Tg extract) or remained noninjected (control). Indeed, Tg-
extract-inoculated mice revealed motor signs and had to be
analyzed already at 7–8 months of age, while control A30P-aS
became symptomatic at 18–22 months of age (Figure 3B). All
symptomatic mice, whether analyzed at 18–22 months (control)
or 7–8 months (Tg-extract induced) revealed severe and equiva-
lent aS pathology in the brainstem (Figure 3C). As a further con-
trol, A30P-aS mice inoculated with aged WT extract did not
show any anticipation of the clinical or the pathological pheno-
type when analyzed at 10 months of age.
Measurements of NfL in both CSF and plasma from nonin-
jected A30P-aS mice revealed a very robust age-related in-
crease (Figure 3D) in magnitude similar to that the A53T-aS
mice (Figure 2) but only reached at 18–22 months of age. Injec-
tion of the A30P-aS mice with tg-extract shifted this increase to
7–8 months, in support of a mechanistic link between the aS
lesions and fluid NfL levels (Figure 3D).
Inhibition of Ab Lesions Decreases NfL in CSF and Blood
of APPPS1 Mice
While inducing proteopathic lesions increased NfL levels in bodily
fluids, reducing such lesions would be expected to reduce NfL
levels. To investigate this, we took advantage of APPPS1 mice
that have been treated with a potent BACE1-inhibitor to inhibit
Ab production and thus the buildup of Ab deposits and associ-
ated pathologies (Figures 4A and 4B) (Neumann et al., 2015).
Indeed, BACE1-inhibitor treatment of APPPS1 mice for 6 months
revealed a 71% reduction of Ab deposition in brain compared to
control mice (Figure 4B). When brain Ab was measured by immu-
noassay, a 97% and 94% reduction of Ab40 and Ab42 was found
(results not shown). Consistently, BACE1-inhibitor-treated mice

plasma value was an outlier and excluded from the analysis (see Experimental Procedures). ANOVAs (age 3 tg) revealed significant age and tg effects and also
significant interactions (int) for CSF (A53T-aS, Fage[2,31] = 25.32, p < 0.001; Ftg[1,31] = 160.3, p < 0.001; Fint[2,31] = 10.75, p < 0.001; P301S-Tau, Fage[3,30] =
120.3, p < 0.001; Ftg[1,30] = 181.4, p < 0.001; Fint[3,30] = 35.22, p < 0.001; APPPS1, Fage[2,30] = 151.1, p < 0.001; Ftg[1,30] = 151.0, p < 0.001; Fint[2,30] = 13.48,
p < 0.001). Similar results were found for blood plasma (A53T-aS, Fage[2,28] = 12.98, p < 0.001, Ftg[1,28] = 56.20, p < 0.001; Fint[2,28] = 11.86, p < 0.001; P301S-
Tau, Fage[3,30] = 19.82, p < 0.001, Ftg[1,30] = 43.12, p < 0.001, Fint[3,30] = 17.82, p < 0.001; APPPS1, Fage[2,30] = 22.35, p < 0.001, Ftg[1,30] = 11.36, p < 0.001,
Fint[2,30] = 0.735, p > 0.05). Note that data were log10 normalized for this analysis (see Experimental Procedures). If appropriate, differences between tg and WT
for each age group were then compared using Bonferroni’s post hoc test for multiple comparisons (**p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001). Note the much higher NfL levels in
CSF and blood of the aged aS mice compared to the Tau mice and in turn to the APPPS1 mice, which corresponds to the observation that the aged aS mice were
end-stage symptomatic while the oldest Tau mice were early-stage symptomatic and the APPPS1 mice did not show obvious neurological signs. See also

 had 63% lower CSF NfL levels when compared to the control
APPPS1 mice (Figure 4C). Plasma NfL levels of BACE1-inhibi-
tor-treated mice were also lowered, albeit the 20% difference
did not reach statistical significance (Figure 4D).
Increased NfL in CSF and Blood of Human
a-Synucleinopathies, Tauopathies, and b-Amyloidosis
To study whether NfL is also increased in CSF and blood in hu-
man diseases with aS, Tau, and Ab lesions, cohorts of normal
healthy controls were compared with cohorts of typical a-synu-
cleinopathies (IPD, DLB, MSA), tauopathies (PSP, CBS) and
b-amyloidosis/tauopathy (mild cognitive impairment [MCI], AD)
(Table S1). Albeit smaller than in the mouse models, increases
in CSF NfL were found in all disease cohorts compared to the
healthy controls with the exception of IPD (Figure 5A). For blood
analysis, serum rather than plasma was available from the hu-
man subjects. However, previous results have found similar
NfL levels and a high correlation of NfL levels between human
serum and plasma (see Experimental Procedures). Strikingly,
and again similar to mice, NfL in blood was increased in all dis-
ease groups but IPD (Figure 5B).
The increase of NfL in both CSF and blood in patients was
1.5- to 5.5-fold as compared with healthy controls and there-
fore much smaller than in mice. Notably, however, and similar
to the mouse models, there was a significant correlation
between human CSF and blood NfL levels in the controls (Fig-
ure S5), and the correlation also reached significance in many
of the disease groups (Table S1). The ratios of blood/CSF
NfL levels in the human samples were 1/30–1/70 (Figure 5)
and were in the same range as in the mouse models (1/30–
1/40; see above and Figure 2). Notably, however, NfL levels
in both CSF and blood of healthy human controls were
approximately 2.5 times lower than in the aged non-tg control
mice.

***p < 0.001). Symptomatic tg-extract-injected A30P-aS mice (n = 6), despite being only 7–8 months old (red bar) revealed significantly higher NfL levels both in
CSF and blood compared to the WT-extract-injected A30P-aS mice (n = 3) (which were analyzed at 10 months of age, see above) (t test, ***p < 0.001). In total, one
CSF and two plasma values were outliers and excluded from the analysis (see Experimental Procedures). All data represented as group means ± SEM.

 Finally, correlation analyses were done between CSF NfL
and CSF Ab42 (the 42 amino acid long Ab species) and Tau,
which were available for the majority of the human samples
(Table S1). No significant correlations were found between
CSF Ab42 and CSF NfL in any of the groups. A positive correla-
tion for CSF Tau and CSF NfL was found in the healthy controls
(rs = 0.39, p < 0.05), IPD (rs = 0.37, p < 0.05), MSA (rs = 0.60,
p < 0.05), but surprisingly not in AD. There was also a significant
correlation between cognitive performance on Mini-Mental State
Examination (MMSE) and CSF NfL (rs = �0.45, p < 0.05) or blood
NfL (rs = �0.45, p < 0.05) in AD, indicating that AD severity may
be reflected in increased NfL levels.
DISCUSSION
We found that NfL levels are elevated in both CSF and blood
of mouse models that replicate the most frequent neurodegener-
ative proteopathic lesions (aS, Tau, and Ab). In all models, NfL
increased, coinciding with the emergence and progression
of the corresponding brain lesions. In two of the models (A30P-
aS and APPPS1), we explored the link between NfL changes
and lesion development by experimentally inducing aS and
blocking Ab lesions. Consistently, NfL levels increased in
response to induction of aS pathology and declined as Ab
pathology was reduced. These findings suggest that CSF and
plasma NfL may serve not only as disease progression
markers but also as treatment response biomarkers for proteo-
pathic lesion-induced neurodegeneration. From a translational
perspective, our preclinical results are supported by elevated
NfL in CSF and notably also in blood of patients with a-synuclei-
nopathies, tauopathies, and b-amyloidosis. Thus, the present
finding that an easily accessible blood biomarker can track
CNS neurodegeneration is a major advantage for preclinical
mouse model research and implies that NfL changes in bodily
fluids may serve as a progression and treatment response
marker for human neurodegenerative diseases.
For the present study, we first set out to adapt and validate a
previously published NfL assay (Gaiottino et al., 2013) for murine
samples and small volumes. This assay was chosen for further
development because it also recognizes human NfL and thus
is of added translational value. Using this assay we found a
strong correlation between CSF and plasma NfL in the mouse
models, suggesting that most of the NfL in blood derives from
the CNS. The fact that the rise in CSF NfL levels occurs earlier
and with greater magnitude compared to the NfL changes in
blood is also supportive of this interpretation.
Remarkably, NfL increases became significant in mouse CSF
and to some extent also in blood before obvious neurological
signs developed. Although future studies with more age groups
per mouse line will refine the development over time, it is likely
that the increases of NfL in CSF and blood tightly coincide with
the occurrence of the proteopathic lesions in brain. Consistently,
NfL levels correlated positively with the protein deposits in each
of the models, and experimental increase or decrease of the
deposits shifted NfL accordingly. An exception was found for
the 2- to 4-month-old A53T-aS mice that have not yet revealed
histologically detectable aS inclusion but exhibited increased
NfL levels. This observation could be explained by the occur-
rence of pathogenic aS aggregates that escape histological
detection.
Since increased CSF and plasma NfL levels were found in all
the models analyzed, it obviously is not specific for aggregates
of aS, Tau, or Ab, suggesting secondary insults as common de-
nominator. Increased NfL in bodily fluids is thought to reflect
axonal injury, axonal pathology, or axonal dysfunction (Petzold,
2005), and indeed axonal pathology has been described in aS-,
Tau-, and APP-tg mouse models (e.g., Lewis et al., 2000; Phinney
et al., 2003; Spittaels et al., 1999; van der Putten et al., 2000;
Wirths et al., 2006) and was also found in the aged mice of the pre-
sent study. The more prominent NfL increase in both CSF and
blood in the aS- and Tau-tg lines compared to the APPPS1 model
may reflect the more rapid disease progression and the predom-
inant brainstem and spinal cord pathology of these aS and Tau
lines. Brainstem and in particular spinal cord harbor thick-caliber
myelinated motor neuron axons that are rich in NfL (Liu et al.,
2004; Petzold, 2005; Yuan et al., 2012a). Consistently, in ALS
patients CSF NfL levels are at least 3-fold higher compared to
AD patients (Gaiottino et al., 2013; Steinacker et al., 2016; Zetter-
berg et al., 2016). Moreover, patients with multiple sclerosis

(A) Schematic illustration for BACE1-inhibitor treatment of APPPS1 mice. Mice
were treated with BACE1-inhibitor or control food pellets for 6 months.
(B) Stereological quantification of cortical immunoreactive (dark blue) Ab
staining (Ab load) in these mice revealed a significant reduction in Ab plaque
deposition in 7.5-month-old BACE1-inhibitor treated mice compared to
age-matched controls (n = 8–10/group; ANOVA, F[2,24] = 154.9, p < 0.001).
Differences between the groups were analyzed using Bonferroni’s post hoc
test for multiple comparisons, ***p < 0.001).
(C) Measurement of NfL in the CSF of the same mice as in (B) revealed reduced
NfL levels in the BACE1-inhibitor treated mice compared to 7.5-month-old
control mice (ANOVA, F[2,24] = 57.51, p < 0.001; Bonferroni post hoc com-
parison ***p < 0.001).
(D) In blood NfL levels significantly increased between 1.5 and 7.5 months of
age and were somewhat reduced in the 7.5-month-old BACE1-inhibitor
treated mice compared to 7.5-month-old control mice, but the reduction was
not significant (ANOVA, F[(2,23] = 58.17, p < 0.001, Bonferroni’s post hoc
comparisons, ***p < 0.001). All data presented are group means ± SEM.

 experiencing an acute spinal cord-located relapse have signifi-
cantly higher CSF NfL than patients with brain-localized relapses
(Kuhle et al., 2013). Thus, the present observations are consistent
with NfL release into the CSF and blood from dysfunctional or
degenerating axons, although the exact mechanism remains
unclear.
To extend our observations from the mouse models to human
diseases, we used the same immunoassay to measure NfL in hu-
man patients with (proteopathic) neurodegenerative disorders.
Consistent with our findings in mice and in line with previous ob-
servations, we found an increase in CSF NfL in a-synucleinopa-
thies (MSA and DLB), tauopathies (PSP and CBS), and mixed
b-amyloidosis/tauopathy (AD and MCI). In IPD, CSF NfL was
not increased, which may reflect not only the slower progression
of neurodegeneration in IPD but also the more topographically
confined neurodegeneration compared to the atypical parkinso-
nian syndromes (APS), including DLB, MSA, PSP, and CBS (Pro-
doehl et al., 2013). The difference between IPD and APS in CSF
NfL (baseline area under the receiver operating characteristic
curve [AUC] = 0.93, specificity 87%, sensitivity 88%) further sup-
ports the impending role of CSF NfL to discriminate IPD from
APS (e.g., Sako et al., 2015). Moreover, the observation that
increased CSF NfL levels are also reflected in blood suggests
that even blood NfL levels may discriminate IPD from APS
(AUC 0.81, specificity 76%, sensitivity 81%).
Remarkably, our results reveal that NfL levels in AD are
elevated not only in CSF but also in blood. Although the increase
did not reach significance in the MCI group (which could be due
to the clinical heterogeneity of MCI subjects), it is likely that not
only CSF NfL (Zetterberg et al., 2016) but also blood NfL may
serve as a biomarker for AD progression, as has recently been
suggested for PSP (Rojas et al., 2016). The reduced CSF and
blood NfL levels after BACE1-inhibitor treatment of APPPS1
mice suggest that NfL may become an easily accessible
biomarker to monitor treatment response in current and future
clinical trials in AD (Vassar, 2014).
While in the mouse models most of the blood NfL likely derives
from brain (see above), the origin of NfL in human blood is less
clear. The NfL plasma/CSF ratio in humans (1/30–1/70) is in a
similar range as in mice (1/30–1/40), and also in humans a corre-
lation between CSF and blood NfL was found, which favors the
argument that most of the blood NfL in humans is also derived
from the brain. However, it is possible that comorbidities of
age-related neurodegenerative diseases influence NfL levels in
blood.
More recently, in addition to being part of the axonal cytoskel-
eton protein complex, NfL has been suggested as an integral
component of synapses (Yuan et al., 2015), and synapse loss
may thus contribute to the increased NfL levels in CSF and
blood. Nevertheless, NfL is also present in CSF and blood of
wild-type mice and healthy humans. Such findings may reflect
not only the putative axonal remodeling but also ongoing syn-
apse remodeling and thus are the basis for the NfL steady-state
level in bodily fluid. Additionally, the present study revealed an
age-related increase in NfL in the CSF and blood of the wild-
type mice, and such an increase has also been observed in
(healthy) humans (Va
˚ gberg et al., 2015). The observation that
CSF and blood NfL levels are 2- to 3-fold higher in aged non-
transgenic mice compared to aged human controls may indicate
that ongoing turnover of axons and synapse remodeling is higher
in mice compared to humans and/or that there are differences in
NfL degradation in bodily fluids between the two species.
Although the present study focused on NfL, other neurofila-
ment subunits may have the potential to complement and refine
Figure 5. Increase of NfL in CSF and Blood Serum of Human a-Syn-
ucleinopathies, Tauopathies, and b-Amyloidoses
(A) NfL in CSF and (B) NfL in serum of healthy controls (HC, n = 35), idiopathic
Parkinson’s disease (IPD, n = 32), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB, n = 20),
multiple system atrophy (MSA, n = 17), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP,
n = 24), corticobasal syndrome (CBS, n = 10), mild cognitive impairment (MCI,
n = 33), and Alzheimer’s disease (AD, n = 34) (see Table S1 for subject details).
Group means ± SEM and individual values are presented. ANCOVA, control-
ling for age, revealed for CSF NfL: F(7,193) = 44.1, and serum NfL: F(7,189) =
19.5, both p < 0.001; Bonferroni’s post hoc comparison was performed
between HC and all the disease groups for CSF and serum. Note: data were
log10 transformed for this analysis. Outliers were excluded (CSF n = 2; serum
n = 4) (see Experimental Procedures). In addition, one CSF sample was
not available, and three serum samples did not yield any signal/were below
level of detection. (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001; ns, not significant). See

 NfL as a bodily fluid marker of proteopathic neurodegenerative
diseases. Indeed, phosphorylated NfH (pNfH) in CSF and blood
has been reported to track disease progression in ALS and other
diseases (Boylan et al., 2013; Petzold, 2005). Phosphorylated
NfH has also been reported to increase in blood of mouse
models with superoxide dismutase 1 inclusions, although assay
sensitivity did not allow measurement of NfH in non-tg control
mice, or samples required preanalytical treatment to overcome
matrix effects (Boylan et al., 2009; Lu et al., 2012).
In summary, the common increase of NfL in CSF and blood
among mouse models of proteopathic lesions and in human
neurodegenerative diseases argues that NfL may become a
key biomarker for disease progression. The fact that NfL levels
in CSF and even blood are sensitive to experimental manipula-
tions or targeted therapies of the proteopathic lesions makes
NfL a primary biomarker to monitor treatment response in pre-
clinical research with potential clinical impact.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Mice
A53T-aS (Thy1-hA53T-aS) (van der Putten et al., 2000), A30P-aS (Thy1-
hA30P-aS) (Neumann et al., 2002), P301S-Tau (Thy1-P301S-Tau) (Allen
et al., 2002), and APPPS1 (Thy1-hKM670/671NL-APP; Thy1-hL166P-PS1)
(Radde et al., 2006) transgenic (tg) and age-matched non-tg WT mice were
used. All mice were bred at the Hertie Institute for Clinical Brain Research.
For A53T-aS, A30P-aS, and P301S-Tau mice, female and male mice were
used, with balanced gender within the groups. For APPPS1, only male mice
were used. All mice were maintained on a C57BL/6 background and kept
under specific pathogen-free conditions. NfL-deficient mice (NFL�/�), gener-
ously provided by R. Nixon (NKI, Orangeburg, NJ) (Yuan et al., 2012b), were
used to assess the specificity of the NfL immunoassay for murine samples
(CSF, blood plasma, and brain tissue). The experimental procedures were
carried out in accordance with the veterinary office regulations of Baden-
Wuerttemberg (Germany) and approved by the local Animal Care and Use
Committees.
Assessment of Neurological Phenotype in Mice
A53T-aS, A30P-aS, and P301S-Tau develop neurological/motor signs around
6, 16, and 14 months of age, respectively (Allen et al., 2002; Neumann et al.,
2002; van der Putten et al., 2000). The phenotype includes tremor, unsteady
gait, hind-limb paresis and clasping, and general muscle weakness. Depend-
ing on severity of the phenotype, mice were staged into early-stage symptom-
atic (detectable tremor and unsteady gait; symptomatic score 0.5) and end-
stage symptomatic (severe tremor and unsteady gait, hind-limb clasping
and paresis; at this time all animals were sacrificed; symptomatic score 1.0).
For A53T-aS mice, both early-stage symptomatic and end-stage symptomatic
were included in the study. For P301S-Tau mice, only early-stage symptom-
atic mice were available. APPPS1 mice (Radde et al., 2006) do not show
obvious neurological signs/phenotype in the home cage up to 18 months of
age, when the mice were sacrificed. Loss of body weight compared to the
non-tg controls was also assessed as a general marker for the wellbeing of
the tg mice.
Seeded Induction of a-Synuclein Lesions in Mice
Brains of symptomatic end-stage female A30P-aS mice (16–20 months old,
n = 5) were dissected, and the brainstem was immediately fresh-frozen on
dry ice. Tissue was pooled from the mice, homogenized (Precellys 24, Bertin
Technologies, France) at 10% (w/v) in sterile PBS (Lonza, Switzerland), vor-
texed, and centrifuged at 3,000 3 g for 5 min. The supernatant was aliquoted
and immediately frozen. Wild-type seeding extract was derived from an aged
(24–26 months old) non-tg male B6 mouse and prepared from the entire brain
without cerebellum (Meyer-Luehmann et al., 2006; Schweighauser et al.,
2015).
Intracerebral injections of the extract were done into young 2-3 month-old
A30P-aS male or female mice. Host mice were anesthetized with a mixture of
ketamine/xylazine (ketamine 100 mg/kg, xylazine 10 mg/kg) in saline and
carprofen (5 mg/kg body weight) was administered prior to surgery. Unilat-
eral stereotactic injections of 1 ml brain extract were made with a Hamilton
syringe into the brainstem (AP �4.0 mm, L ± 1.0 mm, DV �3.5 mm). Injec-
tion speed was 1 ml/min, and the needle was kept in place for an additional
2 min before it was slowly withdrawn. The surgical area was cleaned with
sterile PBS, and the incision was sutured. The mice were kept under infrared
light and monitored until they had recovered from anesthesia. After recovery
from surgery, mice were monitored regularly and sacrificed either upon
the onset of symptoms (see above) or at predetermined time points after
surgery.
BACE inhibitor treatment in mice
Male APPPS1 mice (1.5 months of age) were fed ad libitum with food
pellets containing a BACE1-inhibitor (NB-360; 0.5 g/kg food pellets; Neumann
et al., 2015) or control pellets without the inhibitor for a treatment period of
6 months. Mice were sacrificed at 7.5 months of age.
CSF and Blood Collection in Mice
CSF collection was done as described previously, adopting the standards set
by the Alzheimer’s Association external quality control program for human
CSF biomarkers (Maia et al., 2015; Mattsson et al., 2011) with modifications.
Briefly, after anesthetizing the mice with a mixture of ketamine/xylazine (keta-
mine 100 mg/kg, xylazine 10 mg/kg), CSF was immediately collected from the
cisterna magna. Typically 15–20 ml CSF were collected. CSF samples were
then centrifuged at 13,000 3 g for 30 s (2,000 3 g for 10 min for the BACE1-
Inhibitor study and the aS seeding study), assessed macroscopically for blood
contamination, aliquoted (5 ml), and stored at �80�C until use. Blood-contam-
inated samples were not analyzed. After CSF collection, blood was obtained
by heart puncture with heparinized syringes and centrifuged at 2,000 3 g for
10 min to obtain plasma. Plasma samples were then aliquoted (70 ml) and
stored at �80�C until use.
Brain and Spinal Cord Collection from Mice
Anesthetized mice and corresponding controls were perfused with ice-cold
sterile PBS except for the APPPS1 mice in Figure 1 which were not perfused.
Brains were removed, and one hemibrain was snap-frozen on dry ice and
stored at �80�C until use. The other hemibrain was fixed in 4% paraformalde-
hyde (PFA) in PBS for 48 hr at 4�C, immersed in PBS with 30% sucrose for an
additional 48 hr at 4�C, snap-frozen in 2-methylbutane, and stored at �80�C.
In a subset of mice, spinal cord was collected as follows: anesthetized mice
were initially perfused with ice-cold sterile PBS followed by a 4% PFA perfu-
sion. Then brains and spinal cords were dissected and immersed fixed for
4 hr in 4% PFA. Spinal cords were separated into cervical, thoracic, and
lumbar regions. Brains and separated spinal cord regions were embedded
in paraffin. Paraffin-embedded brains and spinal cords were stored at room
temperature until use.
Histology and Immunohistochemistry of Mouse Brain and
Spinal Cord
Brains were cut into 25 mm-thick sections using a freezing-sliding micro-
tome (Leica SM 2000R). The sections were collected in cryoprotectant
(35% ethylene glycol, 25% glycerol in PBS) for storage at �20�C. Paraffin-
embedded tissue was serially cut into 10 mm-thick sections using a micro-
tome (Thermo Scientific, Microm HM 325), directly transferred on SuperFrost
Plus glass slides, incubated overnight at 60�C and deparaffinized before his-
tological analysis. Antigenity was enhanced by boiling the sections in 10 mM
citrate buffer (1.8 mM citric acid, 8.2 mM trisodium citrate [pH 6.0]) at 90�C
for 35 min for all the antibodies listed below. Immunohistochemistry was
performed according to standard protocols with the Vectastain Elite ABC Kit
(Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA). The following antibodies were
used: rabbit monoclonal pS129 antibody (1:750; EP1536Y, Abcam) specific
to a-synuclein phosphorylated at ser-129, mouse monoclonal AT8 antibody
(1:1,000; Thermo Scientific) specific to Tau phosphorylated at ser-202 and
thr-205, rabbit polyclonal NT12 or CN5 antibody (both 1:2,000; Eisele et al.,
Neuron 91, 56–66, July 6, 2016
63
 2010) to Ab, and mouse monoclonal antibody against NfL (1:1,000, Chemicon).
Sections were counterstained with nuclear fast red according to standard
protocols. For Bielschowsky silver stain, paraffin-embedded sagittal brain
and transversal spinal cord sections were used.
Stereological Quantification of aS, Tau, and Ab Lesions on Murine
Brain Sections
The areal density of phospho-aS (pS129), phospho-Tau (AT8), and Ab immu-
noreactive lesions was quantified in random-systematic set of every 12th
section through the specific brain regions: brainstem for Tau and aS, and
neocortex for Ab. Stereological analysis was performed using a Zeiss Axio-
skop 2 microscope equipped with a motorized x-y-z stage coupled to a video-
microscopy system and the Stereo Investigator software (MicroBrightField
Inc.). Researchers who were blinded to the age groups performed the analysis.
The areal fractions were determined at several focal planes and calculated
from the 25 mm-thick sections.
Human Subjects
Atotalof205CSF/serumpairsfromtheNeuro-BiobankTuebingenwereincluded
(www.hih-tuebingen.de/ueber-uns/core-facilities/biobank/researchers/).Thirty-
five were from healthy controls (HC) and 170 from patients with the different
proteopathic neurodegenerative diseases as follows: IPD (n = 32), DLB (n =
20), MSA (n = 17), PSP (n = 24), CBS (n = 10), MCI (n = 33), and AD (n = 34)
(see Table S1 for demographic and clinical data). HC donated biomaterial to
the biobank in the course of other clinical studies (n = 20), or as patients with
headache or lumbar back pain to exclude vascular (n = 9) or inflammatory
processes (n = 6), respectively. MCI was diagnosed according to published
criteria (Winblad et al., 2004). AD was diagnosed according to the NIA-AA-
criteria (McKhann et al., 2011). IPD and APSs were classified according to
the currently used criteria for the respective form of parkinsonism (Eggert
et al., 2012). Information regarding age, disease onset, and disease duration
was extracted from the database. Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE),
Hoehn and Yahr scale (H&Y), motor part of the Unified Parkinsons Disease
Rating Scale (UPDRS-III), and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)
scores were done on the same day of biomaterial collection. The study
was approved by the ethics committee of the Medical Faculty, University
of Tuebingen (Tuebingen, Germany). All participants, or their next of kin in
the case of relevant cognitive impairment (MMSE score <18), provided a
written informed consent.
CSF and Blood Collection in Human Subjects
CSF and serum collection was performed according to standardized protocols
(Maetzler et al., 2011). In brief, lumbar puncture and blood collection was
performed between 08.00 and 10.00 AM after overnight fasting. Serum
(2,000 3 g) and CSF (4,000 3 g) were centrifuged for 10 min at 4�C and stored
at �80�C within 60 min after collection. Only samples with normal routine CSF
diagnostics were included in the study (leukocytes <4 3 106/L; IgG index CSF
/serum <0.6); slightly increased CSF albumin levels (up to 450 mg/mL) were
accepted and used.
Electrochemiluminescence Immunoassay to Measure NfL in Mice
and Humans
NfL concentrations in brain tissue, CSF, and blood (plasma and serum) were
measured in duplicates using a previously described and validated electroche-
miluminescence (ECL) immunoassay (capture monoclonal antibody: 47:3; bio-
tinylated detector monoclonal antibody: 2:1, UmanDiagnostics AB, Umea
˚ ,
Sweden; Gaiottino et al., 2013) with some modifications.
Murine CSF (5 ml) was prediluted 1:14 in sample diluent (tris buffered saline
(TBS) containing 1% BSA, 0.1% Tween 20 [pH 7.5]) before analysis. Murine
plasma samples were prediluted 1:2 in sample diluent. To measure NfL in
brain, fresh-frozen hemibrains were homogenized (Precellys-24, Bertin Tech-
nologies, France) at 10% (w/v) in homogenization buffer (50 mM Tris [pH 8.0],
150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, and Pierce protease and phosphotase inhibitor
cocktail from Thermo Scientific). The homogenized brain tissue was centri-
fuged at 25,000 3 g, 4�C, for 1 hr. The supernatant was aliquoted and diluted
1:1,000 in sample diluent. Parallelism and linearity of the assay (at the given
dilutions) for murine CSF, plasma, and brain samples were confirmed by serial
dilution experiments (Valentin et al., 2011). The specificity of the assay for
murine NfL was tested using different samples (CSF, blood, brain tissue)
from NfL-deficient mice (see above). In all samples from NfL-deficient mice
(NfL�/�; n = 3), NfL was undetectable (assay signals in two repeat experiments
equal or lower than signal of blank), whereas WT littermate mice (n = 2) had
detectable levels (CSF, 210 and 322 pg/ml; plasma, 31.8 and 31.5 pg/ml),
which were in the range of all the other non-tg mice of the same age assessed
in the present study.
Human CSF and serum measurements were slightly modified by using a
ready-to-use ELISA reagent (Mabtech AB, Nacka Strand, Sweden) as sample
diluent. Unfortunately, plasma was not available from the human subjects.
However, NfL levels from matched human serum and plasma of healthy
controls show a high correlation (n = 25, Spearman r = 0.93, p < 0.0001)
and strong agreement using Bland-Altman method comparison (bias, 3.92;
serum-plasma; 95% confidence interval [CI], �2.41, 10.25; 95% limits of
agreement, �26.15, 33.99; J.K., unpublished data; see also Lu et al., 2015).
For both mice and humans, CSF and blood samples from the same indi-
viduals were assessed on the same plate. Samples from different mouse
strains, ages, and human diseases were evenly distributed across different
plates. Samples with coefficients of variation (CVs) above 20% between
the measured concentrations in the duplicate determinations were reana-
lyzed. In the case of few murine samples with limited volumes and with
NfL values above the highest calibrator (10,000 pg/ml), concentrations
were extrapolated from the standard curve. Intermediate precision (be-
tween-run precision) and repeatability (within-run precision) for the murine
sample measurements ranged between 7.5%–14.9% and 5.5%–8.9% and
for the human sample measurements between 8.4%–14.7% and 6.3%–
9.1%, respectively, for three human serum control samples measured in
duplicate on every 96-well plate. All NfL measurements were done blinded
for age and genotype of the mice and for diagnosis and clinical data from
the human subjects.
Statistical Analysis
The distribution of data was assessed either with Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for
mouse samples or with D’Agostino & Pearson omnibus normality test for hu-
man samples. Outliers were detected with ROUT test (Q = 1) and excluded
from the analysis and are indicated in the figure legends. Non-normally distrib-
uted data were analyzed with nonparametric tests (Kruskal-Wallis). For CSF
and blood NfL values, base10 logarithmic transformation was computed to
normalize the data and then analyzed with parametric statistical tests (ANOVA
or ANCOVA with Bonferroni’s post hoc test). In all cases, statistical signifi-
cance was set at p < 0.05. GraphPad Prism version 6 (GraphPad Software,
La Jolla, California USA) and JMP software (Version 11.2.0; SAS Institute
Inc., Cary, North Carolina, USA) were used for statistical analysis of mouse
and human data, respectively. All graphics were generated with GraphPad
Prism version 6 and presented with mean and SEM.
