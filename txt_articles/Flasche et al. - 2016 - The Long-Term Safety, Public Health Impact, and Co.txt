Abstract
Background
Large Phase III trials across Asia and Latin America have recently demonstrated the effi-
cacy of a recombinant, live-attenuated dengue vaccine (Dengvaxia) over the first 25 mo fol-
lowing vaccination. Subsequent data collected in the longer-term follow-up phase, however,
have raised concerns about a potential increase in hospitalization risk of subsequent den-
gue infections, in particular among young, dengue-naïve vaccinees. We here report predic-
tions from eight independent modelling groups on the long-term safety, public health impact,
and cost-effectiveness of routine vaccination with Dengvaxia in a range of transmission set-
tings, as characterised by seroprevalence levels among 9-y-olds (SP9). These predictions
were conducted for the World Health Organization to inform their recommendations on opti-
mal use of this vaccine.
Methods and Findings
The models adopted, with small variations, a parsimonious vaccine mode of action that was
able to reproduce quantitative features of the observed trial data. The adopted mode of
action assumed that vaccination, similarly to natural infection, induces transient, heterolo-
gous protection and, further, establishes a long-lasting immunogenic memory, which

work. LC is a paid employee at Sanofi Pasteur. GM
and JK were funded by the University of Western
Australia, with computing resources provided by
the Pawsey Supercomputing Centre, which is
 determines disease severity of subsequent infections. The default vaccination policy consid-
ered was routine vaccination of 9-y-old children in a three-dose schedule at 80% coverage.
The outcomes examined were the impact of vaccination on infections, symptomatic dengue,
hospitalised dengue, deaths, and cost-effectiveness over a 30-y postvaccination period.
Case definitions were chosen in accordance with the Phase III trials.
All models predicted that in settings with moderate to high dengue endemicity (SP9 �
50%), the default vaccination policy would reduce the burden of dengue disease for the pop-
ulation by 6%–25% (all simulations: –3%–34%) and in high-transmission settings (SP9 �
70%) by 13%–25% (all simulations: 10%– 34%). These endemicity levels are representative
of the participating sites in both Phase III trials. In contrast, in settings with low transmission
intensity (SP9 � 30%), the models predicted that vaccination could lead to a substantial
increase in hospitalisation because of dengue. Modelling reduced vaccine coverage or the
addition of catch-up campaigns showed that the impact of vaccination scaled approximately
linearly with the number of people vaccinated. In assessing the optimal age of vaccination,
we found that targeting older children could increase the net benefit of vaccination in settings
with moderate transmission intensity (SP9 = 50%). Overall, vaccination was predicted to be
potentially cost-effective in most endemic settings if priced competitively.
The results are based on the assumption that the vaccine acts similarly to natural infec-
tion. This assumption is consistent with the available trial results but cannot be directly vali-
dated in the absence of additional data. Furthermore, uncertainties remain regarding the
level of protection provided against disease versus infection and the rate at which vaccine-
induced protection declines.
Conclusions
Dengvaxia has the potential to reduce the burden of dengue disease in areas of moderate to
high dengue endemicity. However, the potential risks of vaccination in areas with limited
exposure to dengue as well as the local costs and benefits of routine vaccination are impor-
tant considerations for the inclusion of Dengvaxia into existing immunisation programmes.
These results were important inputs into WHO global policy for use of this licensed dengue
vaccine.

 What Did the Researchers Do and Find?
• We used dynamical models with differences in how dengue epidemiology is reflected
but common assumptions on vaccine effects, informed by trial observations, to predict
the impact and cost-effectiveness of Dengvaxia in a variety of situations.
• The results showed that Dengvaxia has the potential to reduce the number of hospitali-
sations because of dengue by 13%–25% and be cost effective in settings where dengue is
common.
• However, in settings with low dengue prevalence, vaccination may increase the inci-
dence of severe illness.
What Do These Findings Mean?
• WHO has now recommended countries consider the use of Dengvaxia in settings with
high dengue endemicity.
• Our results can guide countries on the general suitability of Dengvaxia introduction;
however, local demographics, heterogeneities in endemicity, and health system costs
will need to be taken into account.
Introduction
Recent estimates indicate that dengue virus (DENV) causes at least 50 million cases of symp-
tomatic disease per year [1,2]. DENV is prevalent across the tropics and subtropics, but trans-
mission intensity is highly spatiotemporally variable. Infection with one of the four serotypes
(DENV1–4) appears to provide long-lived immunity to that serotype (homologous protection)
and induces temporary cross-reactive immunity to other serotypes (heterologous protection)
[3,4]. Because of the short-lived nature of heterologous protection, individuals can experience
multiple DENV infections over their lifetimes. The first (primary) DENV infection typically
causes no or mild disease, but secondary DENV infection carries a substantially increased risk
of severe disease [5], thought to be a result of antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). Post-
secondary infections that result in severe disease are rarely observed and hence believed to be
generally mild [4,6,7].
Sanofi Pasteur recently completed Phase III trials of a recombinant, live-attenuated dengue
vaccine (CYD-TDV; Dengvaxia) in Latin America and Southeast Asia [8,9] which by late 2016
has been approved in several countries. Over the 25-mo active surveillance phase of the trials,
average efficacy against virologically confirmed clinical dengue of a three-dose regimen
administered at 6 mo intervals was 60.3% (95% CI: 55.7% to 64.5%) in children between 2 and
16 y. Efficacy varied by age, serotype, and country and was about twice as high in children who
were dengue seropositive (i.e., who have had at least one prior infection with any dengue sero-
type) at the time of vaccination compared to those who were seronegative.
Hospital-based detection of cases has continued and will provide long-term follow-up
information during the 4 y following the active phase. The first year of long-term follow-up
showed that the vaccine remained protective in all age-groups except among 2- to 5-y-old

 children. In this age group, vaccinees had a higher incidence of hospitalisation with virologi-
cally confirmed DENV than unvaccinated controls [10]. In addition, vaccine efficacy among
all age groups was found to be lower during the hospital-based phase than during the active
phase, suggesting waning of vaccine-induced protection.
In April 2015, WHO initiated an open call for mathematical modellers to participate in a
consortium called “Comparative modelling of dengue vaccine public health impact” (CMDVI)
[11,12]. The purpose of the consortium was to generate model-based predictions of the long-
term public health impact of Dengvaxia, reflecting the balance of safety, population-level effec-
tiveness, and economic considerations. The participation of multiple modelling groups with
transparent assumptions enhances the value of the outputs for policy-making. WHO’s inde-
pendent expert advisory committee, the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) on
Immunization, incorporated the results of this model comparison into their recommendations
for appropriate use of the vaccine [13–17]; here, we report our detailed methods, results, and
their wider implications.
Methods
Consortium Formation
Ten groups responded to the open call by WHO for consortium participation [11,12]. Of
these, two groups withdrew subsequently because of time constraints, leaving the following
eight groups as participants: Duke University (Duke), University of Exeter/University of
Oxford (Exeter/Oxford), Johns Hopkins University/University of Florida (Hopkins/UF),
Imperial College London (Imperial), University of Notre Dame (Notre Dame), Sanofi Pasteur,
University of Florida (UF), and University of Western Australia (UWA). All groups agreed to
run epidemiological scenarios using a common set of assumptions about vaccine action (with
varying parameterisation) that were mutually agreed on in discussions with the SAGE Work-
ing Group on Dengue Vaccines and Vaccination [18].
Transmission Models
Details of the transmission models used have been published elsewhere [19–28], but concise
descriptions are provided in S1 Appendix. All models simulated infections by all four serotypes
and most included cross-protection between serotypes (all except Exeter/Oxford) and explic-
itly represented vector population dynamics (all except Duke). All models used demographic
parameters typical of dengue-endemic middle-income countries (Table 1 and S1 Appendix).
Half of the models were deterministic compartmental models (Sanofi Pasteur, Hopkins/UF,
Imperial, Duke), while the other half were stochastic simulation models (Exeter/Oxford, Notre
Dame, UF, UWA). The epidemiological and vaccine parameters used by the four deterministic
models were based on empirical literature estimates and on estimates derived from fitting to
published aggregated data from the active and hospital phases of the Dengvaxia Phase III trials
[8,9]. The Sanofi Pasteur model was fitted to active phase data alone but also made use of
unpublished disaggregated data from the trials [24] and hence was able to estimate serotype-
specific differences in efficacy and epidemiological differences between countries. After initial
fitting, parameters of the Sanofi model were later tuned to better represent the results of the
first year of long-term follow-up. The stochastic models used a combination of parameters
from the literature, from the deterministic model fits, and/or from fitting to dengue transmis-
sion in sites other than the trial sites.
The models differed in assumptions and parameters relating to the natural history and ecol-
ogy of dengue in both humans and mosquitoes as well as in the host demographics assumed.

 In addition, the models varied in what sources of uncertainty they incorporate (Table 1 and S1
Appendix).
Model of Vaccine Action
The groups assumed a consistent model of vaccine action: vaccination mimics a silent (asymp-
tomatic) natural infection in providing short-lived heterologous protection (all except UWA,
who assumed a serotype-specific probability of life-long protection in seropositives) and modi-
fying the probabilities of symptomatic and severe disease outcomes in subsequent natural
infections in the same manner that a natural infection would have done (Fig 1). This vaccine
model provides a parsimonious explanation of the active phase and long-term follow-up
results reported in the Phase III trials [27,29]. Details of the specific assumptions for all models
are provided in S1 Appendix Chapter 1 and Table A.
Trial Simulation
To simulate the Southeast Asian Phase III trial (CYD14), all models represented a single setting
in which the vaccine was delivered in a three-dose schedule at low coverage to children
between 2 and 14 y old. The simulation was run for 3 y postvaccination, representing the 2-y
active monitoring phase and the first year of passive follow-up. The models assume that all
cases of symptomatic dengue and hospitalised dengue in trial participants were reported dur-
ing that period. Predictions were compared with aggregated trial results on (i) age-stratified
seropositivity at time of vaccine receipt, (ii/iii) age- and serostatus-stratified attack rates for
virologically confirmed dengue in both the vaccine and the control arms during the active
phase, and (iv) age-stratified hospitalisation rates for dengue in both the vaccine and the con-
trol arms during the first year of the long-term follow-up. Some models used the simulations
to fit their models to the observed data (aggregated over all countries), and the remaining
models used those parameter estimates for their simulations (Compare Table 1 and S1 Appen-
dix Table B). With the exception of the transmission intensity, parameter values obtained from
fitting or calibrating the trial simulations to the trial data were used in predicting the long-
term impact of routine vaccination. No ethics approval was required for the secondary analy-
ses of these published data.

 Routine Vaccination and Transmission Scenarios
The default policy considered was routine vaccination of 9-y-old children in a three-dose
schedule, in which doses were administered 6 mo apart. Perfect compliance of the three-dose
schedule was assumed with a coverage of 80%. Alternative strategies examined 50% coverage,
addition of a three-dose catch-up campaign in 10- to 17-y-olds at 80% vaccine coverage in the
first year of vaccine introduction, and alternative ages of vaccine administration between 10
and 18 y.
These vaccination strategies were modelled for a variety of levels of dengue endemicity (i.e.,
transmission intensity). Transmission intensity was characterised by the average proportion of
9-y-olds who are seropositive prior to vaccine introduction (labelled SP9), and models were
run for the following transmission scenarios: 10% (very low transmission intensity), 30%
(low), 50% (moderate), 70% (high), and 90% (very high). For comparison, the baseline sero-
positivity rate in children 9 to 12 y old in the trial settings in Asia and Latin America was
between 48% (Mexico) and 91% (Colombia) [30]. Other studies of dengue seroprevalence (i.e.,
the proportion of individuals who have experienced at least one infection with any dengue
serotype) in endemic areas have found values of SP9 in the range of 40% to 81% [31–34].
For each combination of vaccination strategy and transmission intensity, we examined the
impact of vaccination on infections, symptomatic dengue, hospitalised dengue, and deaths
over a 10- and 30-y period after vaccine introduction. Case definitions for symptomatic den-
gue and hospitalised dengue were chosen in accordance with the Phase III trials.
The Phase III trials did not report any dengue-associated deaths and were not powered to
look at the impact of vaccination on mortality. We therefore assumed that vaccine efficacy
against death was the same as that against hospitalised dengue disease. Specifically, each model
Fig 1. Illustration of the assumed vaccine mode of action. Without vaccination (top row), an individual will (by definition) experience a primary infection
first, followed by a secondary infection, and then postsecondary infections. For vaccinees seronegative at the time of vaccination (middle row), their first
natural infection behaves immunologically as a second natural infection would. Subsequent infections would immunologically behave as postsecondary
infections. For vaccinees seropositive at the time of vaccination, any subsequent infection would immunologically behave as a postsecondary infection.
The bottom row depicts such a case, in which the vaccinated individual has previously experienced only a single dengue infection. Because all
postsecondary infections are assumed to have the same risk of disease, vaccination of individuals who have already had two infections would not
modulate the risk of disease for subsequent infections. Boxes are color-coded according to the level of disease risk thought to be associated with primary,
secondary, and postsecondary infections. The specific risks of developing dengue disease differ by modelling group (S1 Appendix Tables B and C).

 assumed that a fixed proportion of hospitalised cases will die. The probability of death was
assumed to be in the range of 0.03% to 0.09% for symptomatic dengue cases (S1 Appendix
Table B), based on a review of surveillance data and published studies from Latin American
countries [1,35–38].
Health Economic Evaluation
The cost-effectiveness of vaccine introduction was evaluated following WHO guidelines [39].
Health effects were measured in terms of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). A time hori-
zon of 30 y was used, but benefits from averted mortality were accrued over the entire lifetime
of the individual. Costs and health effects were discounted at 3% per year. Treatment costs
were selected to broadly reflect an upper-middle-income Latin American country and were
inflated to 2014 $USD. A public health care payer perspective was used (i.e., we did not include
societal costs such as payment for private sector care in the analyses). Sensitivity analyses were
conducted using (i) a societal perspective (using the friction cost approach to calculate the eco-
nomic consequences of premature mortality [40]), (ii) no discounting for health effects, or (iii)
alternative cost parameters broadly reflecting a lower middle-income Southeast Asian country.
Additionally, parameters governing costs and DALYs associated with fatal and nonfatal den-
gue cases, respectively, varied by ±50%.
As both vaccine procurement and delivery costs are unknown, outcomes are presented in
terms of the threshold cost per fully vaccinated person for vaccination to be cost-effective (i.e.,
the maximum amount that can be paid to fully vaccinate one person while remaining cost-
effective). DALYs averted were monetized using values ranging from US$0 to US$10,000 that
allowed comparison to other interventions but with a rate of US$2,000 for each DALY averted
in the base case (S1 Appendix Table C).
Unit costs for treatment and DALYs incurred as a result of dengue were estimated from the
literature (see Table 2; details in S1 Appendix Table C). The results broadly indicate the
regional cost-effectiveness of vaccination on average and should not be interpreted as the cost-
effectiveness in any particular country, which would require a more focused study that evalu-
ated local costs and disease burden.

erences that were used to estimate (after rounding) these values.

 Results
Trial Simulation
All models matched the aggregate data well, with modelled point estimates generally overlap-
ping the confidence intervals of the observed data (Fig 2). Most models captured qualitatively
the increased risk for hospitalisation in vaccinated 2- to 5-y-olds during the first year of the
long-term follow-up; however, they predict it to be substantially lower than the observed point
estimate (Fig 2 and S1 Appendix Figure M). Conversely, all models predict the vaccine efficacy
for the 12–14 y age group to be lower than the observed point estimate.

 Transmission Dynamics in the Absence of Vaccination
In the absence of vaccination—and despite differences in realisations of underlying demo-
graphics—all models generated similar age distributions of disease incidence (S1 Appendix
Figure A) and seroprevalence (S1 Appendix Figure B). In settings with very low transmission
intensity (SP9 = 10%), the burden of DENV disease was fairly evenly distributed among age
groups in the absence of vaccination. At higher transmission intensities, disease burden shifted
towards childhood, with 35% to 70% of all dengue hospitalisations predicted to occur in chil-
dren younger than 9 y.
Population Impact of Routine Vaccination of 9-Y-Olds
In high-transmission settings (SP9 � 70%), models consistently predicted that routine vacci-
nation of 9-y-olds at 80% vaccine coverage would reduce symptomatic and hospitalised den-
gue incidence, with the magnitude of mean reduction varying by model between 13% and 25%
(range of all simulations: 8%–34%) over the first 30 y of the policy (Fig 3 and S1 Appendix
Table D). In settings with very low transmission intensity (SP9 around 10%), most models pre-
dicted an increase in symptomatic DENV cases, while two models (Duke and Exeter/Oxford)
predicted a decrease. These two models predicted a beneficial effect of vaccination on reducing
symptomatic infections because routine vaccination of 9-y-olds at 80% coverage in a setting
with low prevalence resulted in an appreciable herd immunity effect, thereby reducing dengue
circulation and the overall number of infections and cases (S1 Appendix Figure G). All models
predicted an increase in DENV hospitalisations at this very low transmission intensity follow-
ing vaccine introduction. This included the Duke and Exeter/Oxford models, for which the
reduction in the overall number of infections was not sufficiently large to offset the increased

scenario for the range of transmission intensities (columns). The bars represent the mean and the error bars represent the 95% range over

 severity of “secondary-like” breakthrough dengue infections in vaccine recipients. In our
assumed vaccine mode of action, vaccination immunologically primes seronegative recipients,
causing their first natural dengue infection to have the higher severity associated with second-
ary infection in unvaccinated individuals. This leads to overall increases in the incidence of
hospitalised infection in settings where transmission is low enough for a substantial propor-
tion of the population to not be expected to experience secondary infection in the absence of
vaccination.
In settings with low to moderate transmission intensity (SP9 = 30%–50%), predictions were
more variable between models. At SP9 = 30%, models differed over whether the impact of vac-
cination on hospitalised DENV cases was predicted to be detrimental or beneficial. The four
models that showed the most favourable vaccine effect among 2- to 5-y-olds in first year of the
long-term follow-up of the trials (S1 Appendix Figure M) predicted a positive impact of vacci-
nation at age nine on hospitalisations in this setting, while the other four predicted a negative
impact. Similarly, the latter four models predicted a lower impact of vaccination at age nine on
hospitalisations at SP9 = 50%, although all models predicted a decrease in hospitalisation risk
following vaccination in this setting.
In settings with SP9 � 50%, the cumulative number of averted DENV cases was predicted
to accrue almost linearly over time (S1 Appendix Figure E). This is due to the fact that, in most
models, the main impact from vaccination is due to direct protection of vaccines rather than
indirect effects on transmission (S1 Appendix Figure G)—a result of the only transient protec-
tion against dengue infection provided by the vaccine. In contrast, any potential increase in
either symptomatic cases or hospitalisations following vaccination in the SP9 � 30% settings
was only visible after a honeymoon period of about 10 y (S1 Appendix Figure E).
Vaccination was found to impact only moderately on dengue transmission and the propor-
tion of seropositive children at time of vaccination in subsequent years (S1 Appendix
Figure C), with less than a 22% reduction in the hospitalisation rate of children too young to
be vaccinated in all scenarios (S1 Appendix Figure G). Transient protection against infection
following vaccination had limited effect on transmission, except in settings with very low
transmission intensity in some models (see models by Duke and Exeter/Oxford). However,
those models which assumed higher transmissibility of secondary infections (Sanofi Pasteur,
Hopkins/UF, Imperial UF; S1 Appendix Table B) predicted that in moderate- to high-
transmission settings, where many of such secondary infections with high transmissibility are
averted, up to 20% of hospitalisations of children too young to be vaccinated could be averted.
Individual-Level Impact of Routine Vaccination of 9-Y-Olds
Since the trial results suggest that serostatus (i.e., whether an individual has experienced at
least one dengue infection with any serotype in the past) is a key driver of vaccine efficacy, we
further examined the impact of vaccination and its relationship to an individual’s serostatus.
For this, the first vaccinated cohort was followed over 30 y postvaccination. In each transmis-
sion setting, vaccination substantially reduced the risk of symptomatic or hospitalised disease
in recipients who were seropositive at the time of vaccination. Conversely, seronegative indi-
viduals were predicted to be at increased risk for hospitalisation in settings with low to moder-
ate dengue endemicity (SP9 � 30) (Fig 4 and S1 Appendix Table E), with the increased risk
persisting into settings with moderate and high endemicity for some models.
Effect of Varying Vaccination Coverage
Reducing vaccine coverage from 80% to 50% reduced the impact of vaccination proportion-
ately, both for instances in which the vaccine is predicted to be beneficial and in which it is

 predicted to increase the risk for symptomatic dengue or hospitalisation. As a consequence,
the proportion of cases averted per vaccine dose given is similar for 50% and 80% uptake (S1
Appendix Figure H).
Impact of Catch-Up Campaigns
Adding a one-off, three-dose catch-up campaign among 10- to 17-y-olds at 80% coverage in
the first year of introduction to the default policy of routine vaccination of 9-y-olds increased
the impact of vaccination. The impact of such a one-off campaign was most visible in the first
few years. The transient protection against DENV infection induced by the catch-up campaign
in a large proportion of school age children led to a temporary reduction in transmission, fol-
lowed by a rebound in incidence in some of the models, dependent on the transmission setting
and breadth of the catch-up campaign (S1 Appendix Figure J). However, over the long term,
most models predicted that a one-off catch-up campaign prevented a similar number of
DENV hospitalisations per dose of vaccine delivered as the baseline routine vaccination strat-
egy (S1 Appendix Figure I).
Effect of Changing Age for Routine Vaccination
Alternative ages for routine vaccination were explored in the range of 9–18 y (Fig 5 and S1
Appendix Table F). In the highest transmission setting (SP9 = 90%), vaccination at age 9 gave
the largest impact on symptomatic and hospitalised cases, leading to a range of mean reduction
in hospitalised cases of 13%–25% (range of all simulations: 8%–31%) compared to a 5%–12%
(range of all simulations: 3%–16%) reduction if 16-y-olds were vaccinated. Varying the age of
routine vaccination between 9 y and 18 y in settings with SP9 = 50% or 70% showed that the

 maximal difference in the proportion of hospitalised cases averted is smaller than 5% for most
models. Although the predicted optimal age of vaccination varied, in most models this was
10 y–14 y for SP9 = 70% and at the maximum age of evaluation for SP9 = 50%. In low-
transmission settings (SP9 = 30%), all models predicted that the highest impact was achieved
when vaccinating at the highest age examined. In settings with SP9 � 30%, all models pre-
dicted a beneficial population impact on both symptomatic and hospitalised cases if vaccina-
tion is targeted at individuals 14 y of age or older (S1 Appendix Table F).
Cost-Effectiveness
Using base case economic assumptions (3% discounting of costs and DALYs, threshold cost
per DALY averted of US$2,000, public health care provider perspective and middle-income
Latin American country–like costs), the range of mean threshold cost per vaccinated person
across models in the 50%–90% seroprevalence setting was predicted to be US$11–US$44
(range of all simulations: US$8–US$52) (Fig 6 and S1 Appendix Table G). Generally, vaccina-
tion was most cost-effective for SP9 = 70%. In low-transmission-intensity settings
(SP9 = 30%), all models predicted a threshold cost per fully vaccinated person below US$16.
For most models, the threshold cost per fully vaccinated person changed by less than 50% if
leaving health effects undiscounted, using Southeast Asian costs, or varying costs and DALYs
associated with fatal or nonfatal cases. The range of predicted mean threshold costs across
models rose to US$26–US$115 (range of all simulations: US$18–US$156) and US$28–US$104
(range of all simulations: US$21–US$117) per fully vaccinated person in settings with
SP9 � 50% if the threshold cost per DALY averted under base case economic assumptions was
increased to US$10,000 or a societal perspective was adopted (S1 Appendix Fig K).
In line with the model predictions for health impacts, cost-effectiveness was maintained (or
even improved) for later ages of vaccination, except in the 90% seroprevalence setting. The

 incremental cost-effectiveness of a one-off catch-up policy was found to be similar to that of
vaccinating 9-y-olds routinely in moderate-transmission settings but lower in the highest
(SP9 = 90%) transmission intensity setting.
Discussion
The results from this comparative modelling study indicate that Dengvaxia has the potential to
reduce the burden of dengue disease in moderate- to high-transmission-intensity settings
(SP9 � 50%). This range of transmission intensity includes most sites selected for the Phase III
trials of Dengvaxia. The greatest impact of vaccination was predicted for high-transmission-
intensity settings (SP9 � 70%), where routine vaccination of 9-y-olds at 80% coverage was pre-
dicted to reduce DENV-related hospitalisations by between 13% to 25% over the first 30 y fol-
lowing vaccination introduction. However, in settings with low transmission intensity
(SP9 � 30%), we predict that vaccination could increase the incidence of dengue-related hos-
pitalisations. The per-dose impact of vaccination was similar when reduced vaccine coverage
and the impact of a catch-up campaign were examined. Targeting older children could
increase the net benefit of vaccination in settings with low and moderate transmission inten-
sity. Overall, vaccination was predicted to be potentially cost-effective at a threshold of US
$2,000 per DALY across all models in moderate- to high-transmission settings if the costs of
vaccinating an individual could be kept well below approximately US$50 (from a provider per-
spective) or US$100 (from a societal perspective).

 These findings are based on the assumption that the vaccine mimics a natural and clinically
silent infection. While only longer-term follow-up will show if these assumptions hold, at pres-
ent they present a parsimonious explanation of the observed results from Phase IIb and III tri-
als. Under these assumptions, in low-transmission settings, where most individuals are
typically dengue naïve at the age of 9 y, any breakthrough natural infection following vaccina-
tion would result in a secondary-like infection outcome, including an elevated risk of disease
and hospitalization. In those settings, vaccination at an older age may mitigate some of these
effects by allowing more time for children to experience their first natural infection prior to
vaccination. In settings with higher transmission intensities, most children will have had expo-
sure to dengue prior to vaccination and hence vaccination would bypass the dengue infection
associated with the highest disease risk (as these individuals’ next infection would act as a post-
secondary infection). Furthermore, in these highly endemic settings, even children who are
seronegative at time of vaccination are highly likely to experience at least two natural infections
in their life, so the net effect of vaccination is just to lower the age at which they experience a
“secondary-like” infection rather than to increase the overall incidence of such infections.
However, in children who have already experienced two or more infections at time of vaccina-
tion, the vaccine-preventable burden of disease is small because postsecondary infections only
rarely result in severe clinical manifestations. Hence, in settings with extremely high transmis-
sion intensity, the impact of vaccination of 9-y-olds is likely to be smaller than in the scenario
of highest endemicity that we explored.
While model consensus on these qualitative features is strong, there is some discrepancy on
the level of transmission intensity where Dengvaxia transitions from a detrimental to a benefi-
cial impact on dengue disease. Those models that include a better efficacy of Dengvaxia against
hospitalisation of 2- to 5-y-old vaccine recipients in the first year of the long-term follow-up
predict a beneficial net impact of a routine vaccination programme at lower transmission
intensity.
All models predicted that routine use of Dengvaxia in populations who are largely dengue
naïve may increase the burden of dengue disease. This indicates that national decisions on the
implementation of vaccination programmes for dengue will need to identify regions of high
transmission intensity and the appropriate population to target for vaccination. We chose the
seroprevalence at nine years of age as a proxy measure for transmission intensity. Considering
that such data are not available at a sufficient subnational resolution in most endemic coun-
tries, other proxy measures, including existing syndromic surveillance, may be able to be used.
However, the translation between those proxies and seroprevalence will need further
evaluation.
With the implementation of new vaccines, safety monitoring should be in place to detect
adverse events which are too infrequent to be detectable in trials. The results reported here
suggest that a potential safety concern of Dengvaxia is an increased risk of dengue-related hos-
pitalisation for vaccinees who were dengue naïve at time of vaccination, which may only be
observable years after vaccination, particularly in low-transmission settings. Routine safety
monitoring systems are insufficient to capture this unique risk, and carefully designed Phase
IV studies that can account for interseason variability of dengue incidence are needed to assess
whether vaccine rollout leads to increases in the incidence of symptomatic or hospitalised den-
gue in parts of the population.
At a threshold cost per DALY averted of US$2,000, most of the benefit of vaccination in all
the models came from averting health care costs rather than DALYs. However, at a threshold
cost per DALY averted of US$10,000, the value of DALYs averted became more important
than health care costs averted. The number of deaths prevented by vaccination is particularly
uncertain because dengue case fatality risks vary widely by setting; vaccine impact on dengue

 mortality is not directly informed from trials, and case fatality risks tend to be higher in young
children, an age group likely to benefit little from Dengvaxia. Hence, the uncertainty around
estimates with a high threshold cost per DALY averted is greater than when the threshold cost
per DALY averted is at US$2,000.
All models adopted biological assumptions regarding vaccine action that the SAGE Work-
ing Group on Dengue Vaccines and Vaccination agreed best reflected current understanding.
However, current limitations of the available trial data mean uncertainties remain regarding
the level of protection provided against disease versus infection and the rate at which vaccine-
induced protection declines. In particular, the assumption that vaccination acts in a similar
way to natural infection is consistent with the phase III trial results but cannot be directly vali-
dated given the lack of information on the impact on asymptomatic infections or baseline ser-
ostatus in the vast majority of trial participants. Similarly, there is no information about the
impact of a postvaccination infection on the immune state of a seronegative vaccinee; all mod-
els made the plausible, but optimistic, assumption that such individuals would have immunity
comparable to that of someone who had experienced two natural infections [29], but there are
no data available to compare this and other plausible scenarios.
Analyses of trial data stratified by both age and serostatus have indicated that serostatus is a
more important driver of vaccine efficacy than age. Nevertheless, we cannot rule out there
might be intrinsic variation in vaccine efficacy with age, independent of serostatus; if efficacy
is higher in older recipients, vaccine impacts are likely to be larger than presented here (or less
detrimental in low-seroprevalence settings). Vaccine efficacy may also vary by serotype (inde-
pendent of serostatus); only the Sanofi Pasteur model was able to explore this in detail, as trial
data disaggregated by both country and serotype (needed to fit to serotype-specific efficacies)
are not currently publically available.
Important limitations also derive from the data used to calibrate the models against. The
long-term follow-up has not yet been completed, is based on passive surveillance, and was not
designed to assess vaccine efficacy. As a consequence, conclusions drawn from it rely on a lim-
ited number of dengue cases. Also, the trials only provide data from settings with a seropreva-
lence of 9- to 12-y-olds of at least 48%.
Furthermore, underlying uncertainties about dengue epidemiology also affected our pre-
dictions. Perhaps the most pertinent to the predictions of vaccine impact shown is the relation-
ship between symptoms and infectiousness. Whereas many of the models assumed that
symptomatically infected individuals were substantially more infectious than those who were
asymptomatic, several others assumed that symptoms did not alter infectiousness. Empirical
evidence for a relationship between symptoms and infectiousness is mixed [44,45]. If infec-
tiousness is not correlated with disease, the positive impact of vaccination in the respective
models in the high-transmission settings is likely to be slightly lower than the impact predicted
here by these models, while the predicted negative impact in low-transmission settings could
equally be reduced.
The results from the second year of long-term follow-up have recently become available. In
particular, they show that in year 2 of the long-term follow-up in the Southeast Asian trial,
children vaccinated at 6–11 y old were at higher risk for hospitalisation because of dengue
than their unvaccinated controls (although this finding was not seen in the Latin American
trial). Including this additional data did not significantly alter our parameter estimates and,
hence, our prediction of the impact of routine vaccination (see S1 Appendix Figure N). How-
ever, none of the models were able to reproduce the elevated risks in 6- to 11-y-old vaccinees.
A possible explanation is waning of protection in seropositive recipients; all models presented
here assumed such protection to be lifelong. If protection in seropositive recipients does wane,
our predictions of vaccine impact presented here may be overoptimistic. However, additional

 data from year 3 of the long-term follow-up are needed to test this and other hypotheses on
vaccine action.
Conclusion
Informed by the results of this work, the WHO SAGE committee recommended countries
consider introduction of Dengvaxia only in national or subnational settings with high
endemicity—as defined by seroprevalence of approximately 70% or more in the targeted age
group—and recommended against its use in age groups with seroprevalence <50% [13,15].
Decisions at the country level for vaccine introduction may be informed by this work but
should also take into account local dengue epidemiology, predicted impact, and cost-effective-
ness, with country-specific inputs as well as local priorities, affordability, and capacity for
introduction and postlicensure monitoring. To complement a rigorous review of clinical trial
data, mathematical modelling provides an important opportunity to predict the impact of vac-
cination programs that is otherwise difficult to anticipate using clinical trial data when vaccine
performance is variable by host or setting characteristics.
