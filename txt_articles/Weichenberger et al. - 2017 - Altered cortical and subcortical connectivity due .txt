Abstract
In the present study, the brain’s response towards near- and supra-threshold infrasound
(IS) stimulation (sound frequency < 20 Hz) was investigated under resting-state fMRI condi-
tions. The study involved two consecutive sessions. In the first session, 14 healthy partici-
pants underwent a hearing threshold—as well as a categorical loudness scaling
measurement in which the individual loudness perception for IS was assessed across differ-
ent sound pressure levels (SPL). In the second session, these participants underwent three
resting-state acquisitions, one without auditory stimulation (no-tone), one with a monaurally
presented 12-Hz IS tone (near-threshold) and one with a similar tone above the individual
hearing threshold corresponding to a ‘medium loud’ hearing sensation (supra-threshold).
Data analysis mainly focused on local connectivity measures by means of regional homoge-
neity (ReHo), but also involved independent component analysis (ICA) to investigate inter-
regional connectivity. ReHo analysis revealed significantly higher local connectivity in right
superior temporal gyrus (STG) adjacent to primary auditory cortex, in anterior cingulate cor-
tex (ACC) and, when allowing smaller cluster sizes, also in the right amygdala (rAmyg) dur-
ing the near-threshold, compared to both the supra-threshold and the no-tone condition.
Additional independent component analysis (ICA) revealed large-scale changes of func-
tional connectivity, reflected in a stronger activation of the right amygdala (rAmyg) in the
opposite contrast (no-tone > near-threshold) as well as the right superior frontal gyrus
(rSFG) during the near-threshold condition. In summary, this study is the first to demon-
strate that infrasound near the hearing threshold may induce changes of neural activity
across several brain regions, some of which are known to be involved in auditory process-
ing, while others are regarded as keyplayers in emotional and autonomic control. These
findings thus allow us to speculate on how continuous exposure to (sub-)liminal IS could
exert a pathogenic influence on the organism, yet further (especially longitudinal) studies
are required in order to substantialize these findings.

 Introduction
The question, whether infrasound (IS; sound in the very low-frequency range– 1
Hz < frequency < 20 Hz) can pose a threat to physical and mental well-being remains a much
debated topic. For decades, it has been a widely held view that IS frequencies are too low to be
processed by the auditory system, since the human hearing range is commonly quoted to only
span frequencies from about 20 to 20000 Hz [1]. This view was supported by a number of stud-
ies conducted in animals as well as in humans demonstrating that the auditory system is
equipped with several shunting and attenuation mechanisms, which are already involved in
early stages of signal processing and make hearing at low frequencies quite insensitive [2–7].
However, the notion that IS cannot be processed within the auditory system has been con-
tested by several studies, in which IS-induced changes of cochlear function in animals [8] as
well as in normally hearing human participants [9]) have been documented. In fact, it has
been shown repeatedly that IS can also be perceived by humans, if administered at very high
sound pressure levels (SPLs) [10–17]). More recently, two fMRI studies also revealed that
exposure to a monaurally presented 12-Hz IS tone with SPLs of > 110 dB led to bilateral acti-
vation of the superior temporal gyrus (STG), which suggests that the physiological mecha-
nisms underlying IS perception may share similarities with those involved in ‘normal hearing’,
even at the stage of high-level cortical processing [18–19].
Meanwhile, there seems to be a growing consensus that humans are indeed receptive to IS
and that exposure to low-frequency sounds (including sounds in the IS frequency spectrum)
can give rise to high levels of annoyance and distress [20]. However, IS also came under suspi-
cion of promoting the formation of several full-blown medical symptoms ranging from sleep
disturbances, headache and dizziness, over tinnitus and hyperacusis, to panic attacks and
depression, which have been reported to occur more frequently in people living close to wind
parks [21–23]. While it has been established that noise produced by wind turbines can indeed
have a considerable very low-frequency component, IS emission only reaches SPL-maxima of
around 80 to 90 dB [24–27], which may not be high enough to exceed the threshold for percep-
tion. Taking into consideration such results, Leventhall [1] thus concluded that “if you cannot
hear a sound and you cannot perceive it in other ways and it does not affect you”. Importantly,
this view also resonates well with the current position of the World Health Organisation
(WHO), according to which “there is no reliable evidence that infrasounds below the hearing
threshold produce physiological or psychological effects” [28]. However, it appears that the
notion, according to which sound needs to be perceived in order to exert relevant effects on
the organism, falls short when aiming at an objective risk assessment of IS, especially if one
takes into consideration recent advances in research on inner ear physiology as well as on the
effects of subliminal auditory stimulation (i.e. stimulation below the threshold of perception).
For example, 5-Hz IS exposure presented at SPLs as low as 60–65 dB has been shown to trigger
the response of inner ear components such as the outer hair cells in animals [29] and it has
been suggested that outer hair cell stimulation may also exert a broader influence on the ner-
vous system via the brainstem [30–31]. In addition, there is the well documented effect in cog-
nitive science that brain physiology and behavior can be influenced by a wide range of
subliminally presented stimuli, including stimuli of the auditory domain [32–34].
We therefore set out to address the question, whether IS near the hearing threshold can also
exert an influence on global brain activity and whether the effects of stimulation significantly
differ from those induced by supra-threshold IS. In our experiment, IS stimuli were applied
during the so called resting-state, in which participants were asked to lie calmly in the scanner
with eyes closed, while being passively exposed to the sound. During resting-state, a character-
istic pattern of endogenous large-scale brain activity emerges, which commonly involves the

 co-activation of multiple brain regions such as medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), posterior cin-
gulate cortex (PCC), precuneus, inferior parietal lobe (IPL), lateral temporal cortex (LTC), and
hippocampal formation (HC) [35–36]. This activity causes fluctuations of the blood oxygen
dependent (BOLD) signal, which can then be visualized using resting-state functional mag-
netic resonance imaging (rsfMRI). The fact that these brain regions consistently show a
decrease in activity during task performance and an increase during fixation or rest has also
led to the notion of a so-called default mode network [37]. Since a large portion of the IS that
we are exposed to in our daily environment is produced by continuous sources such as wind-
turbines, traffic (cars and planes) or air-conditioning systems, we reasoned that IS may rather
exert influences on the nervous system as a constant and subtle source of (sub-)liminal stimu-
lation, than a source of punctual stimulatory events. In contrast to an event-related approach,
which would be characterized by short alterations of stimulus presentation and data aquisition
(so called ‘sparse sampling’), rsfMRI allowes us to study the brain’s response to IS under condi-
tions, which more closely resemble those found outside of the laboratory, where IS is often pre-
sented over long periods of time without dicontinuities in stimulus administration. One may
argue that the way in which the term resting-state is used throughout the present article is at
odds with the common understand of resting-state as a measure of baseline brain activity in
the absence of experimental stimulation or task. However, researchers are becoming increas-
ingly sensitive to the fact that rsfMRI cannot only be used as a suitable tool for measuring sta-
ble, trait-like characteristics, such as differences due to sexual dimorphism or health
conditions. In fact, spontaneous, self-generated mental processes manifesting as moment-to-
moment fluctuations of the participant’s mood or the „affective coloring”of thoughts and
memories are an inevitable feature of any rsfMRI measurement and it has been argued repeat-
edly that a considerable portion of the statistical variance obtained during data aquisition can
actually be explained by the heterogenity of the participant’s mental states [38–39]. Therefore,
it is precisely this type of data–enriched with diverse experiental aspects gathered across a long
stimulus interval, in contrast to short snippets of the brain’s immediate response to a novel
stimulus–that allows us to best address the research questions presented above.
In order to obtain a more robust signal for the comparison of different resting-state condi-
tions, our analysis focussed on regional homogeneity (ReHo), a measure that captures the syn-
chrony of resting-state brain activity in neighboring voxels–so-called local connectivity. In
contrast to functional connectivity, which reveals synchronization of a predefined brain
region, ReHo measures the local synchronization of spontaneous fMRI signals [40–42].
Importantly, ReHo circumvents the necessity to apriori define seed regions and therefore
allows for an unbiased whole-brain analysis of resting-state data. Furthermore, it has also been
shown that ReHo is higher in the major regions of the default mode network [43]. In order to
obtain a more comprehensive assessment of the effect of IS, independent component analysis
(ICA) was performed as an auxiliary analysis [44]. Similar to ReHo, ICA represents a data-
driven method, which relinquishes any initial assumptions about the spatial location of brain
activations, while allowing to explore the temporal dynamics between more spatially segre-
gated independent areas. Both methods are thus complementary in the sense that they allow
for a characterization of the brain’s response to IS both on the local as well as on the network
level in an unbiased fashion.

 according to the Declaration of Helsinki with approval of the ethics committee of the German
Psychological Association (DGP). All participants had normal or corrected-to-normal vision
and normal hearing (as assessed by means of the ISO (2009) [45] questionnaire filled out by all
participants). No participant had a history of neurological, major medical, or psychiatric disor-
der. All participants were right-handed as assessed by the Edinburgh handedness question-
naire [46].
Acoustic characterization
Prior to the fMRI session, sound pressure levels (SPLs) for the test stimuli were calibrated indi-
vidually according to the results of hearing threshold—[47] and categorical loudness scaling
measurements [48].
Assessment of the participant’s hearing thresholds comprised the presentation of 14 pure
tones ranging from 2.5 to 125 Hz, presented monaurally to the right ear. The experiment was
split into two parts separated by a 15 min break. At the beginning of each part, sounds with
standard audiometer frequencies of 125 Hz (part 1) and 80 Hz (part 2) were presented as the
first stimulus, which allowed participants to accomodate to the experimental setting. The
remaining test stimuli were presented in a pseudo-randomized fashion, which ensured that
the frequency of two consecutive runs differed by more than an octave. Assessment of the indi-
vidual hearing thresholds resembled an unforced weighted up-down adaptive procedure as
described by Kaernbach [49], in which trials consisting of a pair of time intervals (denoted A
and B) separated by a pause of 200 ms were presented. During each trial the test stimulus was
allocated randomly to either interval A or B and it was the participants’ task to indicate which
interval contained the stimulus via keyboard or computer mouse, while receiving visual feed-
back about the accuracy of their responses. Due to the non-linear characteristics of the human
hearing curve, i.e. sounds at different frequencies also need to be administered at different
SPLs in order to give rise to the same loudness perception (see equal-loudness contours; ISO
(2003) [50] and [51]), each test stimulus was initially presented at 20 phon. This means that
the dB SPL of each test stimulus had been chosen in order to give rise to the same loudness as a
1000 Hz tone presented at 20 dB SPL (by definition, 20 phon equals 20 dB SPL at 1000 Hz). In
doing so, we ensured that threshold assessment for each frequency started with the same stim-
ulus intensity and that the initial tone presentation was easily audibility for the participants.
Upon a correct response, stimulus intensity was decreased by one step (initial step size 4 dB),
whereas a wrong response led to an increase by three steps. If participants were unsure, stimu-
lus intensity was increased by one step. After every second reversal (i.e. a response leading to a
downward step (correct answer) followed by a response leading to an upward step (incorrect
or unsure), or vice versa)), the step size was halfed until a final step size of 1 dB was reached.
After 12 reversals, the hearing threshold for the respective test frequency was calculated as the
arithmetic mean of all (adaptive) values following the fourth reversal (1 dB step size).
Categorical loudness scaling comprised the presentation of pure tones with frequencies of
8, 12, 16, 20, 32, 40, 63 and 125 Hz and a duration of 1600 ms, administered monaurally to the
participant’s right ear. It was the participant’s task to rate the loudness of a given test stimulus
according to 11 response alternatives with predefined categories ranging from ‘not heard’,
‘soft’, ‘medium’, to ‘loud’ and ‘extremely loud’ using a computer mouse. The experiment
resembled an adaptive procedure [52] divided into two phases. During the first phase, test sti-
muli were presented at 80 phon and stimulus intensity was increased in adaptive step sizes
ranging from 5 to 15 dB in 5 dB steps until the stimuli were perceived as “extremely loud” or a
predefined maximum level of stimulus intensity was reached (for frequencies below 32 Hz the
maximum sound intensity had been set to 124 dB SPL to protect participants from harmful

 sound exposure). Intensity was then decreased until the stimuli became inaudible and
increased until they became audible again. During the second phase, the remaining categorial
loudness levels were estimated via linear interpolation and presented in a random fashion,
which enabled us to collect more data for the “medium” loudness level. Loudness scaling was
performed twice by each participant with a minimum break of an hour in between sessions.
The results of the hearing threshold measurements were then used to define stimuli for the
near-threshold condition, while categorical loudness scaling ensured that the supra-threshold
stimulus was perceived as equally loud across participants. For the present study, a pure sinu-
soidal stimulus with a frequency of 12 Hz was selected. The average (median) monaural hear-
ing threshold for a 12-Hz pure tone was 86.5 dB SPL, ranging inter-individually from 79 to
96.5 dB SPL. For the near-threshold condition, participant-specific stimuli with SPLs 2 dB
below the individual hearing threshold were chosen. The average (median) SPL for a
‘medium-loud’ tone determined in the categorical loudness scaling sessions was 122.3 dB SPL
with an applied minimum of 111 dB and a maximum of 124 dB across participants (for a
detailed description, see Table 1). For the hearing threshold—and the categorical loudness
scaling measurements, stimuli were presented via the same sound source that was also used in
the subsequent fMRI session and experiments were run in a soundproof booth next to the
scanner room.
Scanning procedure
Images were collected on a 3T Verio MRI scanner system (Siemens Medical Systems,
Erlangen, Germany) using an 12-channel radiofrequency head coil. First, high-resolution ana-
tomical images were acquired using a three-dimensional T1-weighted magnetization prepared
gradient-echo sequence (MPRAGE), repetition time = 2300 ms; echo time = 3.03 ms; flip
angle = 9˚; 256 × 256 × 192 matrix, (1 mm)3 voxel size. Whole-brain functional images were
collected using a T2�-weighted EPI sequence sensitive to BOLD contrast (TR = 2000 ms,
TE = 30 ms, image matrix = 64 × 64, FOV = (224 mm)2, flip angle = 80˚, slice thickness = 3.5

 mm, 35 near-axial slices, aligned with the AC/PC line). Before the resting-state data acquisition
started, participants had been in the scanner for about 10 minutes. During those 10 minutes, a
localizer was run and other images were aquired so that participants could get used to the scan-
ner noise.
fMRI stimulus protocol
Sound signals were generated by a 24 bit DAC-device (RME Fireface UC), connected to a per-
sonal computer, amplified or attenuated and fed to a modified loudspeaker system outside of
the scanner room. The loudspeaker system was attached to a polyethylene tube (length 8 m,
inner diameter 14 mm) leading to the participant’s right ear (Fig 1). In order to avoid audible
transients, the 12-Hz pure tones used for stimulation were faded in and out with a cos2 on-
and offset ramp of 250 ms (3 cycles) and had a total duration of 200 s. A regular earplug
(E-A-R One Touch, 3M, St. Paul, USA) with a Noise Reduction Rating (NRR) of 33 dB was
used for the left ear. In addition, both ears were covered with a Silverline 140858 ear defender
(NRR: 22 dB) in order to minimize the interference of scanner noise with auditory processing.
The infrasound source was designed to exhibit particularly low harmonics generation, i. e the
amplitudes of all harmonics are significantly below the hearing threshold [47]. In order to con-
trol for higher harmonics in the present study, SPLs were measured via an optical, metal-free
microphone (Sennheiser MO-2000) coupled to the sound path by means of a T-fitting 20 cm
upstream of the ear. Participants were instructed to listen attentively and to avoid movements
of their bodies [53]. During the scan session, each participant underwent one unstimulated
and two stimulated acquisitions (runs), each run lasting 200 s. The unstimulated run involved
no auditory stimulation (no-tone), while during the two stimulation runs a 12-Hz IS tone was
presented either at 2 dB below the individual hearing threshold (near-threshold) or at

 ‘medium’ perceived loudness (supra-threshold). Before the start of each run, subjects were
instructed to keep their eyes closed, relax and not think of anything in particular. The sequence
of the three resting-state runs was counterbalanced across participants and participants were
not informed about the order in which the runs were conducted.
Data analysis–Regional homogeneity (ReHo)
The first five volumes of each run were discarded to allow the magnetisation to approach a
dynamic equilibrium. Part of the data pre-processing, including slice timing, head motion cor-
rection (a least squares approach and a 6-parameter spatial transformation) and spatial nor-
malization to the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) template (resampling voxel size of 3
mm × 3 mm × 3 mm) were conducted using SPM5 and the Data Processing Assistant for Rest-
ing-State fMRI (DPARSF, [54]). A spatial filter of 4 mm FWHM (full-width at half maximum)
was used. Participants showing head motion above 3 mm of maximal translation (in any direc-
tion of x, y or z) and 1.0˚ of maximal rotation throughout the course of scanning would have
been excluded. After pre-processing, linear trends were removed. Then the fMRI data was
temporally band-pass filtered (0.01–0.08 Hz) to reduce low-frequency drift and high-fre-
quency respiratory and cardiac noise [55]. ReHo analysis was performed using DPARSF [56–
59]. ReHo is based on previous reports that fMRI activity is more likely to occur in clusters of
several spatially contiguous voxels than in a single voxel [60–61]. Therefore, ReHo assumes
that a given voxel is temporarily similar to that of its neighbors. ReHo was originally invented
for the analysis of (slow) event-related fMRI data (Zang et al., 2004) [59], but is equally suited
for block-design and resting-state fMRI. For each participant, ReHo analysis was performed
on a voxel-wise basis by calculating the Kendall’s coefficient of concordance (KKC, [62]) of the
time series of a given voxel with those of its neighbors (26 voxels). The KCC value was assigned
to the respective voxel and individual KCC maps were obtained. ReHo was calculated within a
brain-mask, which was obtained by removing the tissues outside the brain using the software
MRIcro [63]
Whole-brain comparisons between conditions were computed on the basis of the resulting
ReHo maps. A height threshold of p < 0.001 and cluster-size corrected by means of Monte
Carlo simulation (10000 iterations) was used. Significant effects were reported when the vol-
ume of the cluster was greater than the Monte Carlo simulation determined minimum cluster
size for the whole-brain volume (> 22 voxels), above which the probability of type I error was
below 0.05 (AlphaSim; [64]). From the resulting clusters, ReHo values were extracted for all
three conditions. Coordinates are reported according to the MNI space. Brain regions were
defined using the the SPM-based automated anatomical labeling (AAL) atlas toolbox [65] and
reported as Brodmann areas (BA).
Data analysis—Independent Component Analysis (ICA)
Independent component analysis (ICA) is an exploratory analysis tool in which source signals
are blindly recovered [44] from mixtures of sources. ICA was performed using GIFT software
(http://icatb.sourceforge.net/; [66]) using an Infomax algorithm. Preprocessed data from all
sessions and all individuals were used. The optimal number of spatially independent resting-
state networks (N) to be extracted was estimated by the software (N = 21). The networks were
identified automatically using predefined templates in GIFT and later by one of the co-authors.
From the 21 components, 12 were identified as resting state networks and taken to the second
level analysis in SPM12 (paired t-test, FWE p<0.01 and mean framewise displacement [67] as
a covariate).

 Results
ReHo
When computing a whole-brain analysis comparing ReHo as derived from resting-state acqui-
sitions for different stimulation conditions, we found significantly higher local connectivity in
right superior temporal gyrus (rSTG) (30, -15, -6) adjacent to primary auditory cortex during
the near-threshold compared to the no-tone condition. The only other significant difference
between all possible pairwise contrasts of ReHo maps was observed when comparing the near-
threshold condition with the supra-threshold condition. Here, we found significantly higher
ReHo in anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) (-12, 27, 33) during the near-threshold condition.
Interestingly, when using a more lenient cluster extent threshold of k > 10, we also found
higher ReHo in the right amygdala (rAmyg) (21, -3, -15) (results are summarized in Fig 2 and
Table 2). In order to explore the ReHo pattern across all three conditions, we extracted beta-
values from the respective clusters observed in the whole-brain contrasts. These values are
depicted as box plots in Fig 3 and all parameters of the statistical analysis are also summarized
in Table 3. Im summary, it could be demonstrated that prolonged supra-threshold IS stimula-
tion clearly perceived by all participants did not result in statistically significant activations
anywhere in the brain. In contrast, near-threshold stimulation led to higher local connectivity
in multiple brain areas, compared to both the no-tone as well as the supra-threshold condition.
Note, however that the extraction of beta-values was only chosen for illustrative purposes and
inferences were taken from the original analysis.

 ICA
From the 21 components of the ICA analysis, 12 were identified as resting state networks:
three dorsal default mode networks (DMN; R = 0.4, 0.3 and 0.2), two ventral DMNs (R = 0.5
and 0.3), two left executive control networks (R = 0.27 and 0.25), one sensorimotor network
(R = 0.3), one basal ganglia network (R = 0.24), one visuospatial network (R = 0.31), one poste-
rior salience network (R = 0.15) and one auditory network (R = 0.16). Significant condition
differences are shown in Table 4. Decreased functional connectivity–as compared to the no-
tone condition–was found during resting state with near-threshold tone presentation in the
right amygdala (rAmyg) in the sensorimotor network. Resting state sessions with near-thresh-
old tone presentation were associated with increased functional connectivity in the right supe-
rior frontal cortex (rSFG) in the left executive control network when compared to the no-tone

 condition. In addition, there was increased functional connectivity in the lobule IV and V of
the left cerebellum in the DMN for near-threshold sessions compared to supra-threshold ones.
Discussion
The results of the present study can be summed up in the following way: Prolonged IS expo-
sure near the participants’ individual hearing threshold led to higher local connectivity in
three distinct brain areas–rSTG, ACC and rAmyg–, while no such effect was observed for
stimulation above the hearing threshold. Our data also shows that near-threshold IS was asso-
ciated with connectivity changes on the network level, emphasizing the role of the rAmyg in IS
processing. To our knowlegde, this study is the first to demonstrate that near-threshold IS
does not only produces physiological effects, but that the neural response involves the activa-
tion of brain areas, which are important for auditory processing but also for emotional and
autonomic control. These findings thus allow us to reflect on how (sub)-liminal IS could give
rise to a number of physiological as well as psychological health issues, which until now have
only been loosely attributed to noise exposure in the low- and very low-frequency spectrum.
Thus far, evidence regarding the influence of IS on brain activity is limited to two fMRI-
studies. Dommes et al. [18] were the first to show that monaural stimulation with a 12-Hz IS
tone led to an activation of the bilateral STG, when stimuli were applied at SPLs of 110 as well
as 120, but not at 90 dB. However, this pioneering study suffered from the methodological
drawback that during 12-Hz stimulation 36-Hz harmonics had been present, which left some
room for doubt whether it had really been the IS component that triggered the neural
response. In addition, Dommes et al. (2009) were not able to draw reference to psychophysical
data about the participants’ hearing thresholds or verbal reports and could therefore only spec-
ulate that IS exposure at 110 and 120 dB must have led to a hearing sensation, whereas stimula-
tion with 90 dB should not have exceeded the hearing threshold. Recently, Weichenberger
et al. [19] also reported bilateral STG activation in response to supra-threshold IS stimulation,
however, in this study an improved setup that prevented higher harmonics from reaching the
participants’ ear in combination with acoustically well-characterized participants giving verbal
reports after the scan session were employed. Suprisingly, we are facing an entirely different
situation in the present study, as STG activation was absent during supra-threshold stimula-
tion, but clearly present when IS was administered near the hearing threshold. These results
are particularly noteworthy, since not only the experimental setup but also 11 out of the 14
participants were identical across Weichenberger et al.’s [19] and the present investigation. It
thus appears that the seemingly contradictive results cannot be attributed to different instru-
mentation or participants, but rather point towards truely different neural responses which
have been uncovered due to the nature of data acquisition as well as the time course of stimu-
lus application chosen in this study. Since we were interested in studying the brain’s response

 to IS under conditions, which more closely resemble those found outside of the laboratory, we
chose significantly longer stimulus intervals (200 s) and also provided a constant level of stim-
ulation throughout the entire interval. This is in contrast to the aforementioned studies, in
which short stimulus intervals consisting of multiple successive tone bursts (1 and 3 s respec-
tively) with interleaved image aquisitions were employed. The absence of STG activation dur-
ing supra-threshold IS exposure could therefore be the result of stimulus-specific adaptation,
according to which the BOLD signal gradually decreases in response to ongoing stimulus
administration [68–69]. However, although stimulus-specific adaptation times of up to tens of
seconds have been reported in the auditory cortex of animals [70], nothing is known about
adaptation over comparable time-scales in humans. In addition, this explanation cannot
account for why near-threshold stimulation would be affected to a lesser extent by such mech-
anisms. In contrast, we hypothesize that our results rather reflect the complex involvement of
different physiological processes in response to near-threshold and supra-threshold IS, as well
as the interference of attentional effects, which may play an increasingly important role when
stimuli are presented over longer durations. Several studies provide evidence for the existence
of a ‘subconscious hearing route’ for IS, according to which IS may exert effects on the organ-
ism via outer hair cells, even if presented at SPLs below the hearing threshold [71, 31]. While
inner hair cells–the main signal transducers involved in ‘conscious hearing’–connect with fusi-
form cells of the cochlear nucleus from which the signal is then relayed to higher levels of the
auditory system, outer hair cells terminate in the granule cell regions of the cochlear nucleus
[72] and from there on connect to numerous auditory as well as non-auditory cortical process-
ing sites [73]. Importantly, since some of these centers are involved in attentional control and
arousal [74], it has been suggested that activation of this pathway could for example wake peo-
ple up at night, while leaving them unable to pin down what it actually was that caused them to
waken [75]. Similarly, in our experiment, participants were constantly left guessing, whether
stimulation actually occurred or not when near-threshold IS was presented, whereas during
supra-threshold stimulation, participants were clearly able to allocate attention towards or
away from the percept throughout the entire stimulus interval. We therefore suggest that per-
sistent exposure to supra-threshold IS may have led to a top-down attenuation of the signal via
attentional mechanisms, whereas in the absence of a clearly identifiable percept, STG activa-
tion remained high. However, it needs to be mentioned that the average (median) SPL of the
supra-threshold stimulus (122,3 dB SPL, as determined via individual loudness scaling) was
very close to the safety limit of 124 dB SPL, which probably points towards the presence of a
ceiling effect. We therefore cannot rule out that participants may have reported a medium-
loud hearing sensation at even higher SPLs, if our ethical guidelines would have allowed us to
apply stimuli at such intensities. The ceiling effect may have led to slight discrepancies with
respect to inter-individual loudness perception during the supra-threshold runs and thus have
produced additional variability in our imaging data. Nevertheless, we conclude that the effect
was probably not pronounced enough to suppress an otherwise significant effect. It also needs
to be noted that in contrast to the aforementioned studies on IS processing, near-threshold
stimulation led to a cortical response of the ispilateral side, as compared to a bi-hemispheric,
yet also stronger response of the contralateral side (i.e. the left auditory cortex) when supra-
threshold stimulation was employed [18–19]. This touches on the aspect of a presumed lateral-
ization of the auditory system, the true nature of which is still part of an ongoing debate, as evi-
dence both in favor of a contralateral dominance for monaurally presented sounds [76–77], as
well as a left hemispherical preference irrespective of which ear is stimulated (Devlin et al.,
2003) [78] has been put forward. It thus appears that while the preceeding accounts seem to
support the notion of “contralateral dominance” extending to sounds in the infrasound spec-
trum, the results of the present studies could rather be explained by the fact that evoked

 otoacoustic emissions (which are generated via outer hair cells) also tend to be more pro-
nounced on the right ear [79–80]. However, more information needs to be gathered on how
OHC signals are processed up-stream on the level of the brainstem, and in what way OHC
activation influences the activity of auditory (and possibly non-auditory) centers.
The ACC is generally regarded as a key player in the monitoring and resolution of cognitive
[81–83], as well as emotional conflicts [84–87]. Interestingly, a recent meta-analysis by Mene-
guzzo et al. [88] also revealed that the ACC reliably exhibits activation in response to both sub-
as well as supraliminally presented arousing stimuli, which led the authors to suggest that this
brain area may function as a gateway between automatic (‘pre-attentive’) affective states and
higher order cognitive processes, particularly when affect and cognition are in conflict. In
addition, the authors explicitly gave credit to the fact that the term ‘conflict’ may also include
unexpected perturbations of the body’s physiology in the absence of conscious awareness.
Moreover, another line of research also highlights the ACC’s involvement in autonomic con-
trol via its extensive connections with the insula, prefrontal cortex, amygdala, hypothalamus
and the brainstem [89–90]. ACC activation in response to near-threshold IS stimulation could
therefore be interpreted as a conflict signaling registration of the stimulus which, if not
resolved, may lead to changes of autonomic function.
Similarily, the amygdala is well know for its involvement in emotional processing, especially
with respect to fear conditioning, but also in the broader context of stress- and anxiety-related
psychiatric disorders [91]. Several studies have documented activation of the amygdala in
response to aversive sensory stimuli across different modalities, such as odorants [92], tastes
[93], visual stimuli [94–96], as well as in response to emotional vocalization [97–99] and
unconditioned sounds that are experienced as aversive [100–102]. Activation of the rAmyg
during near-threshold IS exposure may be of particular interest for a risk assessment regarding
IS, because the amygdala is known to be involved in auditory processing and may also play a
major role in debilitating tinnitus and hyperacusis [103]. It is a fairly established finding that
auditory input can be processed along two separate neural pathways, the classical (lemniscal)
and the non-classical (extralemniscal) pathway [104–105]. While signals travelling along the
classical pathway are relayed via ventral thalamic nuclei mostly to the primary auditory cortex,
signals traveling along the non-classical pathway are bypassing the primary auditory cortex as
dorsal thalamic nuclei project to secondary- and association cortices and also to parts of the
limbic structure such as the amygdala. Importantly, the non-classical pathway (frequently
called the ‘low route’) allows for direct subcortical processing of the stimulus in the amygdala,
without the involvement of cortical areas [106–107] and may therefore play a crucial role in
the subliminal registration of ‘biologically meaningful’ stimuli, such as near-threshold IS. In
fact, it has been suggested that in certain forms of tinnitus, activation of the non-classical path-
way can mediate fear without conscious control [108] and, via its connections to the reticular
formation [109], also exert influences on wakefulness and arousal. Additional evidence for the
amygdala’s involvement in subliminal processing and autonomic control comes from a study
conducted by Gla
¨scher and Adolphs [110], in which patients with unilateral as well as bilateral
lesions of the amygdala were presented emotional visual stimuli of varying arousal sub- as well
as supraliminally, while skin conductance responses (SCRs) were recorded as a measure of
autonomic activation. Interestingly, it could be shown that the left amygdala decodes the
arousal signaled by the specific stimulus (linked to a conscious fear response), whereas the
rAmyg provides a global level of autonomic activation triggered automatically by any arousing
stimulus (linked to a subconscious fear response). It is particularily noteworthy that while the
rAmyg exhibited increased local connectivity in response to near-threshold IS, ICA revealed a
decoupling of the rAmyg from the sensorimotor network in comparison to the no-tone condi-
tion. It has been repeatedly argued that decoupling of the amydgala from areas involved in

 executive control may enable an organism to sustain attention and supports working memory
[111], thus potentially aiding cognitive control processes in the aftermath of stress [112]. Inter-
estingly, the fact that functional connectivity of the rSFG was higher during near-threshold
stimulation further substantiates this claim. Again, several studies demonstrate that rSFG and
rAmyg share functional connections and that activity between the two regions tends to be neg-
atively correlated [113, 112]. Thus, partipants who were left guessing whether stimulation
occured, may have enganged in effortful regulation of affect, trying to minimize the conse-
quences of stress on cognitive control networks.
Finally, our results also allow us to draw some preliminary conclusions on potential long-
term health effects associated with (sub-)liminal IS stimulation. It has been reported in several
studies that sustained exposure to noise can lead to an increase of catecholamine- and cortisol
levels [114–116]. In addition, changes of bodily functions, such as blood pressure, respiration
rate, EEG patterns and heart rate have also been documented in the context of exposure to
below- and near-threshold IS [117–118]. We therefore suggest that several of the above men-
tioned autonomic reactions could in fact be mediated by the activation of brain areas such as
the ACC and the amygdala. While increased local connectivity in ACC and rAmyg may only
reflect an initial bodily stress response towards (sub-)liminal IS, we speculate that stimulation
over longer periods of time could exert a profound effect on autonomic functions and may
eventually lead to the formation of symptoms such as sleep disturbances, panic attacks or
depression, especially when additional risk factors, such as an increased sensibility towards
noise, or strong expectations about the harmfulness of IS are present. Also, while in this discus-
sion, we put a strong emphasize on the physiological implications of prolonged IS exposure, it
would also be interesting to see, whether our rsfMRI paradigm could be used to relate IS-
induced changes of global-brain states and changes in the experiental domain.
Conclusion
To our knowledge, this study is the first to document changes of brain activity across several
regions in response to prolonged near-threshold IS using fMRI. ReHo analysis revealed higher
local connectivity of rSTG, ACC and the rAmyg only when IS was administered near the hear-
ing threshold and ICA showed that effects can also be found on the inter-regional level. On the
one hand, these results seem to support the hypothesis that (sub-)liminal IS can exert an influ-
ence on the organism via a subconscious processing route (which supposedly involves outer
hair cell-mediated signal transduction). On the other hand, though clearly audible, prolonged
stimulation with IS above the hearing threshold did not lead to changes of brain activity,
which could indicate that the signal processed along the conscious hearing route may have
been attenuated in a top-down fashion via attentional mechanisms. Also, since the brain’s
response to prolonged near-threshold IS involves the activation of brains areas, which are
known to play a crucial role in emotional and autonomic control, a potential link between IS-
induced changes of brain activity and the emergence of various physiological as well as psycho-
logical health effects can be established. Transient upregulation of these brain areas in response
to below- or near threshold IS may thus reflect an initial stress response of the body, eventually
promoting symptom formation as stimulation occurs repeatedly and additional risk factor
come into play. Nevertheless, further research, in particular longitudinal exposure research, is
needed in order sustantiate these findings and contribute to a better understand of IS-related
health effects.
