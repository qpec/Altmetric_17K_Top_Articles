BACKGROUND: Exposure to ambient particulate matter (PM) is associated 
with a number of adverse health outcomes, but potential mechanisms are 
largely unknown. Metabolomics represents a powerful approach to study 
global metabolic changes in response to environmental exposures. We 
therefore conducted this study to investigate changes in serum metabolites in 
response to the reduction of PM exposure among healthy college students.
METHODS: We conducted a randomized, double-blind crossover trial in 
55 healthy college students in Shanghai, China. Real and sham air purifiers 
were placed in participants’ dormitories in random order for 9 days with 
a 12-day washout period. Serum metabolites were quantified by using 
gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and ultrahigh performance liquid 
chromatography-mass spectrometry. Between-treatment differences in 
metabolites were examined using orthogonal partial least square-discriminant 
analysis and mixed-effect models. Secondary outcomes include blood 
pressure, corticotropin-releasing hormone, adrenocorticotropic hormone, 
insulin resistance, and biomarkers of oxidative stress and inflammation.
RESULTS: The average personal exposure to PMs with aerodynamic 
diameters ≤2.5 μm was 24.3 μg/m3 during the real purification and 53.1 
μg/m3 during the sham purification. Metabolomics analysis showed that 
higher exposure to PMs with aerodynamic diameters ≤2.5 μm led to 
significant increases in cortisol, cortisone, epinephrine, and norepinephrine. 
Between-treatment differences were also observed for glucose, amino 
acids, fatty acids, and lipids. We found significantly higher blood pressure, 
hormones, insulin resistance, and biomarkers of oxidative stress and 
inflammation among individuals exposed to higher PMs with aerodynamic 
diameters ≤2.5 μm.
CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that higher PM may induce metabolic 
alterations that are consistent with activations of the hypothalamus-
pituitary-adrenal and sympathetic-adrenal-medullary axes, adding potential 
mechanistic insights into the adverse health outcomes associated with 
PM. Furthermore, our study demonstrated short-term reductions in stress 
hormone following indoor air purification.

C
onvincing epidemiological evidence suggests that 
exposure to higher levels of ambient particulate 
matters (PMs), especially fine PMs with aerody-
namic diameters ≤2.5 μm (PM2.5), may have adverse 
cardiovascular and metabolic consequences such as 
hypertension, coronary heart disease, stroke, and dia-
betes mellitus.1–4 Although potential biological mech-
anisms for these adverse health effects are yet to be 
fully ascertained, inflammation and oxidative stress are 
likely to be involved.5–7 In addition, several studies have 
reported an association between PM exposure and 
dysfunction of the automatic nervous system, which is 
known to increase cardiovascular risk.8–10 Animal stud-
ies further implicated PM2.5 as a stressor to the central 
nervous system that might induce a cascade of neu-
roendocrine responses.11,12 These provocative findings 
warrant mechanistic investigations in humans.
In the past decade, metabolomics has emerged as a 
powerful tool to understand metabolic changes, par-
ticularly of small molecules (<1000 Da), in response 
to pathophysiological conditions or environmental ex-
posures.13 With high-throughput technologies such as 
chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry or 
nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, metabolo-
mic analysis can efficiently separate and quantify a large 
number of compounds from a single biological sample, 
and thus identify novel molecules and pathways that 
are affected by diseases or environmental exposures. 
In recent years, metabolomics has been used to inves-
tigate global metabolic disruptions related to expo-
sures of heavy metals, organic chemical compounds, 
and ozone.14 However, to the best of our knowledge, 
few studies have used this approach to understand the 
global metabolic changes in response to PM.
Using the metabolomics approach, we conducted a 
randomized, double-blind, crossover trial of air purifica-
tion to gain mechanistic insights into the adverse car-
diovascular and metabolic changes associated with PM 
exposure. In addition to metabolomics, we also exam-
ined blood pressure and biomarkers of oxidative stress 
and inflammation as secondary outcomes of interest.
METHODS
Study Design and Participants
This randomized, double-blind, crossover trial was conducted 
from November to December 2015. We recruited 60 col-
lege students from 17 nonsmoking dormitories on Jiangwan 
Campus, Fudan University in Shanghai, China. All participants 
were healthy young adults with no history of allergic, respira-
tory, or cardiovascular diseases. To minimize potential indoor 
source of PM, we asked participants to refrain from cooking 
or housecleaning during the study period.
The 17 dormitories received alternate treatments in random 
order at each study period intermitted by a 12-day washout 
period. For the treatment of real purification, a high-efficiency 
air purifier was put in the middle of the dormitory, whereas, 
for the treatment of sham purification, we simply removed 
the filter gauze. According to the manufacturer, these air puri-
fiers (model KJEA200E, 3M Filtrete, Shanghai, China) have a 
recommended cleaning area of 20 m2 and a clean air delivery 
rate of 200 m3/h. All treatments started at 7 pm on Friday of the 
week and ended at 7 am the following Sunday. During each 
study period, all windows and doors were tightly closed. Other 
than taking classes, participants were required to stay in their 
dormitories as much as possible. A self-administered question-
naire of time-location was completed by all participants. At 
the end of each study period, we conducted a health test and 
collected samples within an hour.
The study protocol was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov 
(NCT02712333) and was approved by the Review Board of 
School of Public Health, Fudan University. All participants pro-
vided written informed consent at enrollment.
PM Exposure Measurements
We chose PM2.5 as the main exposure of interest because of 
its well-documented adverse cardiovascular and metabolic 
outcomes.4,15–18 Indoor PM2.5 concentration in each dormi-
tory was measured by using the MicroPEM Personal Exposure 
Monitor (RTI International) which was placed at least 1 m 
away from the purifier and ≈1.5 m above the ground. Real-
time PM2.5 concentrations were recorded every 10 seconds. 
This device does not have a display screen so participants did 
not know their exposure levels. In addition, we installed an 
outdoor PM2.5 monitor (GRIMM EDM180, GRIMM Aerosol 
Technik GmBH&Co. KG) on the rooftop of the main building 
in Jiangwan Campus to measure outdoor PM2.5 levels during 
the study. Last, we obtained hourly PM2.5 data from 13 fixed-
site monitoring stations across Shanghai. For each participant, 
we then calculated individual exposure to PM2.5 during each 
Clinical Perspective
What Is New?
• This is the first-ever study to use the metabolo-
mics approach with a randomized, double-blind, 
crossover design to explore biological mechanisms 
underlying the adverse health effects of particulate 
matter (PM) exposure.
• Higher PM exposure led to a significant increase in 
serum levels of stress hormones, suggesting acti-
vations of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal and 
sympathetic-adrenal-medullary axes;
• We also observed metabolic changes in glucose, 
amino acids, and lipids in response to PM exposure.
What Are the Clinical Implications?
• Activations of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal 
and sympathetic-adrenal-medullary axes may con-
tribute to the adverse cardiovascular and metabolic 
effects of PM exposure.
• In China, indoor air purification is a practical way to 
reduce personal exposure to PMs and may improve 
cardiovascular health in the long run.

study period by mapping the time and location data to the 
appropriate PM2.5-monitoring data. To ensure the quality of 
monitoring data, we calibrated all monitoring devices at the 
beginning of each period. Temperature and relative humidity 
were recorded using temperature/relative humidity data log-
gers (HOBO UX100-003, Onset Computer Corporation), or 
collected from Shanghai Meteorologic Bureau.
Health Measurements and Sample 
Collection
Demographic information such as age, sex, height, weight, 
and disease history was collected at enrollment. Blood pres-
sure was evaluated before the study and following each 
period. For each participant, left upper arm blood pressure 
was measured 3 times with measurement intervals of at least 
2 minutes by a trained staff using a mercury sphygmoma-
nometer. We used the second and third measurements to cal-
culate mean systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood 
pressure (DBP). Pulse pressure was calculated as the differ-
ence between mean SBP and DBP
.
We collected peripheral blood and first-void morning urine 
from each participant at the end of each study period. Venous 
blood (3 mL) was collected after 12 hours of fasting by using 
vacuum collection tubes, water bathed at 37°C for 15 min-
utes, and then centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes to 
extract serum. Morning urine (10 mL) was collected by using 
sterilized tubes. All samples were transported at 4°C within 
2 hours and stored at –80°C until analysis. We conducted 
all examinations and collected samples at 7 am on Sundays 
to minimize potential influence from physiological changes 
attributable to circadian rhythm.
Serum Metabolomics Analysis
Global metabolomics analysis was conducted by using gas chro-
matography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and ultrahigh perfor-
mance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS). 
GC-MS analysis was performed by using an Agilent 7890A 
gas chromatography incorporated with Agilent 5975C Time-
of-Flight mass spectrometer platform (Agilent Technologies). 
UPLC-MS analysis was conducted with Agilent 1290 Infinity 
UPLC and Agilent 6538 Ultra High Definition and Accurate-
Mass Quadrupole Time-of-Flight mass spectrometer platform 
(Agilent Technologies). Quality control and blank control sam-
ples were added into the sequence to assess the data repeat-
ability. Detailed sample preparation, GC-MS and UPLC-MS 
acquisition, and quality control are described Methods in the 
online-only Data Supplement. Ion peaks generated from GC-MS 
were annotated in the NIST 11 standard mass spectral database 
and Fiehn database,19 whereas ion peaks from UPLC-MS were 
annotated by searching the human metabolite database and 
the METLIN database.20,21 All data were log-transformed for 
normalization and Pareto-scaled before statistical analysis.
Biomarker Measurements
We measured 4 biomarkers of oxidative stress, including 
urinary 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguansine (with creatinine calibra-
tion), serum malondialdehyde, iso-prostaglandin F2α, and 
superoxide dismutase. These biomarkers reflect DNA oxida-
tive damage (8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguansine), lipid peroxidation 
(malondialdehyde and iso-prostaglandin F2α), or antioxidant 
potential (superoxide dismutase), which have been examined 
extensively in previous studies on PM2.5.5,22–26 In addition, 
we measured 6 serum biomarkers of systemic inflamma-
tion (soluble CD40 ligand, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, 
interleukin-1β, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-α, and 
intercellular adhesion molecule-1) and 3 hormones (insulin, 
corticotropin-releasing hormone [CRH], and adrenocortico-
tropic hormone [ACTH]). We then calculated homeostatic 
model assessment of insulin resistance as an indicator of 
insulin resistance using the following formula: homeostatic 
model assessment of insulin resistance=fasting glucose (mg/
dL)×insulin (mU/L)/405. Concentrations of 8-hydroxy-2-deox-
yguansine, iso-prostaglandin F2α, CRH, ACTH, insulin, and all 
inflammatory biomarkers were measured with enzyme-linked 
immunosorbent assays, and glucose, malondialdehyde, and 
superoxide dismutase were measured with oxidase peroxi-
dase, thiobarbituric acid–reactive substances, and water-solu-
ble tetrazolium salt assays, respectively. All laboratory analyses 
were conducted according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Statistical Analysis
We have provided details of GC/UPLC-MS raw data pre-
processing Methods in the online-only Data Supplement. 
In brief, raw data were processed by using the ChromaTOF 
software (GC-MS) (v4.24, LECO), with Agilent MassHunter 
Quantitative (UPLC-MS) and XCMS (UPLC-MS) for peak align-
ment, integration, and normalization to obtain data matrixes 
containing retention time, mass-to-charge ratio (m/z), peak 
intensity, and sample information. We then analyzed prepro-
cessed data using a combined strategy of multivariate and 
univariate methods. First, we conducted unsupervised princi-
pal component analysis to examine the clustering of quality 
control samples. Second, we performed a supervised orthog-
onal partial least square-discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) to 
discriminate serum metabolomes between the 2 treatments. 
Validation for OPLS-DA models was conducted in a 7-fold 
cross-validation process, and model overfitting was examined 
in a 999-time permutation test. We used R2Y and Q2 to evalu-
ate the goodness-of-fit and predictive ability of each model,27 
and we used the variance importance in the projection (VIP) 
scores to define contributions from individual metabolites to 
the overall between-group difference in the OPLS-DA model.
For each metabolite with a VIP score >1.0, we used linear 
mixed-effect models to identify statistically significant differ-
ences between treatments with a fixed-effect binary variable 
for purification status (0 for sham and 1 for real purification) 
adjusting for age, sex, body mass index, and a random inter-
cept for each participant. Results were adjusted for multiple 
comparisons using false discovery rate.28 We then con-
structed mixed-effect models to examine the associations 
between 9-day average PM2.5 exposure for each participant 
and log-transformed relative peak intensity for each metab-
olite, adjusting for age, sex, body mass index, a randomized 
intercept for each participant, and the mean temperature 
and relative humidity during study periods. All continuous 
covariates were mean centered before analysis. To identify 
metabolites that contributed the most to the between-treat-
ment metabolome difference and were significantly associ-
ated with PM2.5 exposure, we selected all metabolites with

the following criteria: (1) a VIP score >1.0 from the OPLS-DA 
model; (2) P value for between-treatment difference <0.05 
and false discovery rate <0.05; and (3) significant associa-
tion with PM2.5 exposure from linear mixed-effect models 
with false discovery rate <0.05. For each metabolite that 
was identified, we calculated fold changes between the 
sham purification (higher PM2.5 exposure) and the real puri-
fication (lower PM2.5 exposure), and percentage changes per 
10 μg/m3 increase of PM2.5 exposure.
We used similar mixed-effect models to examine changes 
of blood pressure, urine, and serum biomarkers between 
treatments and in relation to PM2.5 exposure. Last, we con-
ducted 3 sensitivity analyses for all the health outcomes: (1) 
adding a random intercept for each dormitory in the model 
to control for possible dormitory effect, (2) including an indi-
cator variable as a fixed-effect term in the model to examine 
potential period effects, and (3) including an interaction term 
(sex×PM2.5) in the model to explore potential interactions 
with sex. For health outcomes that showed statistical inter-
actions with sex, we further conducted stratified analyses.
Both principal component analysis and OPLS-DA were 
performed with SIMCA-P 14.0 (Umetrics). Analyses in lin-
ear mixed-effect models were conducted using the lme4 and 
lmerTest package of the R software (R Foundation for Statistical 
Computing). All statistical tests were 2-sided with α=0.05. Results 
were presented as percentage changes in health outcomes com-
paring the sham purification with the real purification, or as per-
centage changes for each 10 μg/m3 increase of PM2.5 exposure.
RESULTS
Baseline Description
A total of 60 participants with an equal number of 
males and females were recruited, and 55 (28 males 
and 27 females) completed the study (Figure 1). Base-
line demographic characteristics and blood pressure 
measurements are summarized in Table 1. No partici-
pant left urban Shanghai during the study.
PM2.5 Exposure
Table 2 presents the averages of outdoor and indoor 
PM2.5 concentrations during the study. In both study 
periods, participants reported ≈75% of their time in 
their dormitories. As expected, the indoor PM2.5 level 
was lower during real purification, on average 82% 
than that during sham purification. Furthermore, the 
averaged 24-hour personal exposure to PM2.5 was also 
54% lower during the real purification, at a level below 
the World Health Organization air quality guideline (24-
hour average: 25 μg/m3).
Serum Metabolites Identification
A total of 2213 peaks were detected by GC-MS and 
UPLC-MS from all 110 serum samples. Pooled quality 
control samples clustered tightly in principal compo-
nent analysis models, indicating an excellent repeatabil-
ity (Figure I in the online-only Data Supplement). Scor-
ing plots generated from OPLS-DA models revealed a 
clear separation between the sham and real purification 
(Figure II in the online-only Data Supplement). Seven-
fold cross-validations R2Y and Q2 indicated good fitness 
and predictability, and the negative Q2 from 999-time 
permutation tests suggested no overfitting in OPLS-DA 
models (Table I in the online-only Data Supplement).

Last, 97 metabolites, including stress hormones, glu-
cose, amino acids, fatty acids, lipids and their metabo-
lites, were identified. Sensitivity analyses showed that 
our results were robust after further adjustment for 
dormitories and the fixed-effect term of period was 
not significant, suggesting no period effects (data not 
shown). Our exploratory interaction analyses showed 
significant interactions of PM2.5 with sex for 5 metabo-
lites (Figure III in the online-only Data Supplement).
Serum Stress Hormones in Relation to 
PM2.5 Exposure
Of the 97 metabolites, we found higher levels of serum 
glucocorticoids (cortisone and cortisol), catecholamine 
(epinephrine and norepinephrine), and melatonin in 
association with higher PM2.5 (Table 3). For example, 
serum cortisol and cortisone levels were 1.33 and 1.18 
times higher during the sham over the real purifica-
tion. Each 10 μg/m3 increase in PM2.5 exposure level 
was associated with 7.79% (95% confidence interval 
[CI], 4.75–10.91) increase in cortisol and 3.76% (95% 
CI, 1.84–5.71) increase in cortisone. The correspond-
ing increases were 1.20-fold and 5.37% (95% CI, 
3.30–7.48) for epinephrine and 1.57-fold and 11.70% 
(95% CI, 7.36–16.22) for norepinephrine. Similar in-
creases were also observed for phenylalanine, tyrosine, 
and tetrahydropteridine, which are key amino acid 
precursors and enzyme cofactor in the catecholamine 
synthesis, and for the neurotransmitter melatonin and 
its precursor tryptophan, serotonin, and N-acetylsero-
tonin (Figure 2).
Glucose, Amino Acid, and Lipid 
Metabolisms in Relation to PM2.5 
Exposure
PM2.5 exposure was associated with serum levels of me-
tabolites that are involved in metabolisms of glucose, 
amino acid, and lipid. As shown in Table II in the online-
only Data Supplement, the serum levels of glucose and 
glucose 6-phosphate were significantly higher during 
sham purification and were associated with PM2.5 ex-
posure. Associations of serum metabolites with PM2.5 
exposure were also evident for 10 amino acids (argi-
nine, leucine, histamine, threonine, serine, glutamine, 
lysine, phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan) and 
for derivatives or intermediate products of amino acid 
metabolism, as well (Table II in the online-only Data 
Supplement). Similar observations were made for free 
fatty acids and metabolites that are involved in fatty acid 
oxidation, including carnitine, acylcarnitine, hydroxy fat-
ty acids, and acetone (Table III in the online-only Data 
Supplement). In addition, membrane phospholipids and 
their hydrolyzed products, including lysolipids and 2 
eicosanoids, increased with higher PM2.5 exposure (Table 
IV in the online-only Data Supplement). Last, 12 other 
metabolites, including purines and pyrimidines, were 
also found associated with PM2.5 exposure (Table V in 
the online-only Data Supplement).
Blood Pressure and Biomarkers in 
Relation to PM2.5 Exposure
We found higher blood pressures in association with 
higher PM2.5 exposure (Figure 3). In comparison with 
the real purification, the SBP was 2.61% (95% CI, 
0.39–4.79) higher during the sham purification, and 
each 10 μg/m3 increase in PM2.5 exposure was associ-
ated with 0.86% (95% CI, 0.10–1.62) increase in SBP; 
similar changes, albeit not statistically significant, were 
observed for DBP and pulse pressure. Using blood pres-
sure at enrollment as the reference, we found signifi-
cant decreases in both SBP and DBP during the real pu-
rification, but not during the sham purification  
(Figure 
IV in the online-only Data Supplement). The serum 
level of CRH was 28.03% (95% CI, 1.82–61.00) and of 
ACTH was 6.71% (95% CI, 0.51–12.53) higher in the 
sham purification than the real purification (Figure 4).

were significantly higher during the sham purification, 
and, with the exception of insulin, they were also as-
sociated with PM2.5 as a continuous exposure (Figure 
VII in the online-only Data Supplement). For these bio-
markers, we did not identify any meaningful effects in 
relation to dormitories and study periods, or significant 
effect modification by sex.
DISCUSSION
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that 
used the untargeted metabolomics approach to inves-
tigate human global metabolic changes in relation to 
changes in ambient PM exposures. In this randomized, 
double-blind, crossover trial, we found marked chang-
es in serum metabolites, including hormones, glucose, 
amino acids, and lipids, in association with higher PM2.5 
exposure. Consistent with previous publications from 
us29 and other groups in China,7,30 we also observed 
increases in blood pressure and levels of biomarkers of 
inflammation and oxidative stress in relation to higher 
PM2.5.
Results from this clinical trial suggest that the human 
central nervous system reacts to changes in PM expo-
sures. We observed increases in glucocorticoids, ACTH, 
and CRH in relation to higher PM exposure, suggesting 
activation of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) 
axis. A study in animals also showed increases of CRH 
and glucocorticoids after acute exposures to PM2.5.11 It 
is possible that, in the response to inhalation of PM, 
the hypothalamus releases CRH, which stimulates the 
anterior pituitary gland to release ACTH into the cir-
culation. ACTH in turn targets the adrenal cortex and 
stimulates the synthesis and release of glucocorticoids, 
mainly cortisol and cortisone. These changes may have 
several physiological ramifications. Glucocorticoids el-
evate blood pressure by increasing cardiac output, 
constricting blood vessels, and inducing sodium and 
fluid retention.31 Therefore, the HPA axis activation 
and increase in glucocorticoids may explain in part the 
observed higher blood pressures associated with PM 
exposures. In this study, we observed significant asso-
ciations of PM2.5 with SBP
, which might reflect increased 
cardiac output in response to higher PM exposure; we 
only observed a positive but statistically insignificant 
trend for DBP
, which mainly reflects vasoconstriction. 
These observations are consistent with some but not 
all the previous studies.15,29,32–34 In addition to its physi-
ological effects on blood pressure, glucocorticoids may 
also affect energy metabolism by increasing metabolic 
rate and energy expenditure, increasing blood glucose 
levels, and enhancing lipolysis, lipid oxidation, proteoly-
sis, and insulin resistance.35–39 In the present study, we 
also consistently found that higher PM2.5 exposure was

associated with increased levels of homeostatic model 
assessment of insulin resistance, glucose, fatty acids, 
acylcarnitines, and amino acids.
Besides glucocorticoids, our data also suggest that 
norepinephrine and epinephrine, 2 main catechol-
amines released by the sympathetic-adrenal-medullary 
axis, increased in association with PM exposure. The 
synthesis and secretion of catecholamine in the adre-
nal medulla is regulated by preganglionic sympathetic 
neurons. In addition, glucocorticoids from the HPA axis 
could also modulate catecholamine synthesis by induc-
ing phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase.40,41 Epi-
nephrine can activate the HPA axis by stimulating ACTH 
secretion from the pituitary gland.42 Indeed, our data 
suggest correlated changes of cortisol, epinephrine, and 
norepinephrine in relation to changes in PM2.5 exposure 
level (Figure VIII in the online-only Data Supplement). By 
binding to various cellular receptors, epinephrine and 
norepinephrine may induce profound metabolic chang-
es via increased glycolysis and lipolysis, hypertensive 
changes via arterial smooth muscle constriction and in-
creased cardiac output,43 and proinflammatory changes 
via increased expression of proinflammatory cytokines.44
Last, our results suggest that PM exposure may stim-
ulate the secretion of melatonin, a hormone that regu-
lates circadian cycle and has multiple cardioprotective 
properties.45 It has also been suggested that melatonin 
has antihypertensive effects probably because of its 
anti-inflammatory and reactive oxygen species scaveng-
ing properties, and its capability in improving endothe-
lial function and interacting with central and peripheral 
nervous system.46 Melatonin was synthesized from se-
rotonin with N-acetylserotonin as an intermediate prod-
uct. The secretion of melatonin in the pineal body is reg-
ulated by norepinephrine via β-adrenergic receptors.47 
Therefore, the changes of melatonin in response to PM 
exposure level may be influenced by the activation of 
the HPA and sympathetic-adrenal-medullary axes.
In addition to changes in the central nervous system, 
we observed higher lysolipids in association with higher 
PM exposure, which may be the result of membrane 
hydrolysis. Lysolipids, including lysophosphatidylcholine 
and lysophosphatidylethanolamine, are important sig-
naling molecules by interacting with G-protein–coupled 
receptors in various cells and tissues. They can modulate 
cellular activities such as cellular permeability, apopto-
sis, and cell proliferation and migration.48 In addition, 
lysophosphatidylcholine may induce production of mi-
tochondria reactive oxygen species, upregulate the lev-
els of adhesion molecules, and stimulate secretions of 
inflammatory chemokines and superoxide anion; these 
changes may, in turn, lead to endothelial cell activation 
and vascular endothelial inflammation responses.49–52 
We consistently found increments of inflammatory and 
oxidative stress biomarkers in association with higher 
PM exposure. These biological changes may be re-
sponsible in part for the adverse cardiovascular effects 
caused by PM exposure.
One important strength of the current study is that 
we tested a very feasible strategy to reduce indoor air 
pollution level among a free-living population. It builds 
on a previous study from us that demonstrated clear 
cardiopulmonary benefits following 48 hours of con-
secutive indoor air purification among college stu-
dents.29 Although it remains to be examined whether 
the observed health benefits could be generalized to 
other populations or be translated to long-term health 
benefits, this study offers a very practical way to miti-
gate some of the adverse health effects for residents in 
areas with relatively high air pollution.
Our study also has several limitations. First, for out-
door PM2.5 concentration, we had to rely on fixed-site 
monitoring in the campus or in nearby stations, which 
inevitably led to measurement errors. However, these 
measurement errors should be nondifferential with 
respect to both study periods and may cause under-
estimates in our results.53 Second, we did not collect 
blood samples at enrollment and thus were unable to 
specifically exclude potential impacts from daily varia-
tion. However, to a certain extent, this concern could 
be mitigated by the crossover study design in which all 
participants started and ended treatments at the same 
time of the same day within a relatively short study pe-
riod of 4 weeks. Furthermore, our sensitivity analyses 
did not find any meaningful period effects.
In this study, we used PM2.5 as a marker for overall PM 
exposure. PM2.5 has been used as the PM exposure met-
ric in numerous previous studies.1,4,26,29 However, because 
we did not collect data on size-fractioned PM, PM con-
stituents, or gaseous pollutants, we could not attribute 
our findings solely to PM2.5. We do not believe the results 
could be explained by changes in gaseous pollutants or 
the interactions between particles and gases because the 
purifier was designed to remove particles only. However, 
we cannot exclude the possibility that coarse PM, ultra-
fine particles, or specific PM components (eg, lipopoly-
saccharide, metals) may contribute to our observations. 
In particular, we found higher levels of insulin and ACTH 
levels during the sham purification group without a sta-
tistical association with PM2.5 per se, suggesting potential 
effects attributable to correlated PM metrics.
In summary, this first-ever randomized, double-blind, 
crossover trial of metabolomics analysis on particulate 
air pollution demonstrated potential metabolic effects 
following reduction in short-term PM exposure. Our 
analyses suggest significant changes in the HPA and 
sympathetic-adrenal-medullary axes, and changes in 
glucose, amino acids, and lipids, as well, in relation 
to changes in PM exposure level. These novel findings 
provide insights into the potential mechanisms of the 
adverse health effects that have been found to be as-
sociated with PM2.5 exposure. Future studies should ex-

air purification could be maintained and translated into 
improved health in the long run.
