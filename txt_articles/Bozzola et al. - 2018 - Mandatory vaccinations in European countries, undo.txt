Abstract
Background: High rates of vaccination coverage are important in preventing infectious diseases. Enforcing
mandatory vaccinations is one of the strategies that some Countries adopted to protect the community when
vaccination coverage is not satisfactory. In Italy, in 2017 vaccination against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, hepatitis B,
poliovirus, Haemophilus influenzae type b, measles, mumps, rubella and varicella became compulsory in childhood.
In order to contrast vaccination policies, anti-vaccination campaigns contribute to the spread of fake news. Among
them, there is the false information that Italy is the only one country with mandatory vaccination policy. Aim of our
study is confronting vaccination policies in children under 18 months against among different European countries
for the following vaccines: diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, hepatitis B, poliovirus, Haemophilus influenzae type b,
measles, mumps, rubella and varicella.
Methods: Information on policies of mandatory or recommended vaccinations of the European Countries were
gathered by ECDC and compared to the Italian one.
Results: European Countries recommend or contemplate compulsory vaccines. Among them, eleven Countries (35.
4%) have mandatory vaccinations for at least one out of diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, hepatitis B, poliovirus,
Haemophilus influenzae type b, measles, mumps, rubella and varicella vaccine.
Conclusion: Not only in Italy, vaccination against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, hepatitis B, poliovirus, Haemophilus
influenzae type b, measles, mumps, rubella and varicella is mandatory in children under 18 months. Other European
countries adopted compulsory policies in order to prevent the spread of infectious diseases and to protect the
community.

 Background
High rates of vaccination coverage in childhood are im-
portant to prevent infectious diseases contributing to the
decline in mortality and morbility. In this contest, vacci-
nations represent one of the most important tool of pri-
mary prevention [1].
Lack of information and fake news are actually recog-
nized among the main factors contributing to low
immunization coverage. In particular, the increasing risk
of vaccine preventable disease outbreaks and the de-
creasing vaccine coverage could be related to vaccine
hesitancy [2].
In this contest, anti-vaccination campaigns have had a
damaging impact on vaccine uptake. For example, the
link between Mumps-Measles-Rubella vaccine and aut-
ism described in a now-retracted article published by
The Lancet in 1998 is still questioning the safety of vac-
cines [3].
Enforcing mandatory vaccinations is one of the strat-
egies that some Countries adopted and others are con-
sidering in order to face this issue. Polices that mandate
vaccinations have always been controversial and related
to opposition and disputation. A recent American Sur-
vey have shown that more than 10% of parents disap-
proved compulsory vaccinations and was opposed to
their safety and utility [4].
Aim of our study
Aim of our study is confronting vaccination policies in
children under 18 months against diphtheria, tetanus,
pertussis, hepatitis B, poliovirus, Haemophilus influenzae
type b, measles, mumps, rubella and varicella among dif-
ferent European countries.
Methods
Information on policies of mandatory or recommended
vaccinations of the 31 European Countries were gath-
ered by ECDC and were taken from the official website
(https://vaccine-schedule.ecdc.europa.eu/) and are sum-
marized in Table 1 [5].
For the purpose of the study, a mandatory vaccination
is defined as a vaccination that every child must receive
by law without the possibility for the parent to choose to
accept the uptake or not [6].
A recommended vaccination is a vaccination that is
included in the national immunization program for all
or for some specific groups independent of being
funded or not [6].
Results
A total of 31 European Country was analyzed.[5] In par-
ticular, a percentage of one hundred was in favor with
vaccinations in childhood. Eleven Countries introduced
mandatory
vaccination
(35.4%)
and
the
other
recommended vaccination. Latvia has ten mandatory
vaccines in childhood as well as Italy. Some countries
(Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, France, Hungary,
Poland and Slovakia) have as many as nine vaccines
which are compulsory among children. All the European
Countries recommended or introduced compulsory vac-
cinations for the following vaccinations: tetanus, diph-
theria,
pertussis,
Haemophilus
influenza
type
B,
Hepatitis B, poliovirus, mumps, measles, rubella with
the exception of Iceland that did not recommend Hepa-
titis B vaccination.
Mumps, measles, rubella
In nine Countries (Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic,
France, Hungary, Italy, Latvia, Poland, Slovakia) vaccin-
ation against mumps-measles-rubella is mandatory. It is
recommended in the other twenty-two Countries.
Varicella
Vaccination against varicella is mandatory in Italy and
Latvia. It is recommended in eight Countries without re-
strictions and in three Countries only for specific groups.
Tetanus-diphtheria-pertussis
In ten Countries (Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic,
France, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Latvia, Poland, Slovakia)
vaccination is mandatory and is recommended in the
other twenty-one Countries.
Haemophilus influenza type B
Vaccination
for
Haemophilus
influenza
type
B
is
mandatory in nine Countries (Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech
Republic,
France,
Hungary
Italy,
Latvia,
Poland,
Slovakia,) and is recommended in twenty-two Countries.
Hepatitis B
Vaccination for Hepatitis B is mandatory in nine Coun-
tries (Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, France, Hungary,
Italy, Latvia, Poland, Slovakia) and it is recommended in
twenty Countries. Denmark recommend vaccination just
for specific groups and Iceland did not recommend it.
Poliovirus
Poliovirus vaccination is mandatory in ten Countries
(Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, France,
Hungary, Italy, Latvia, Poland, Slovakia) and recom-
mended in all the others.
Discussion
National and regional immunization polices are sup-
ported by vaccination coverage. In particular, it can in-
fluence the interventions done and increase or decrease
vaccine uptake [7].

 Considering the Italian scenario and immunization
coverage data from 2010 to 2016, coverage rates have been
decreasing since 2012 and are – as for now – still below
the targets established by the Ministry of Health, with a
great heterogeneity within the different regions [8].
With regards to Hepatitis B, tetanus, diphtheria, polio-
virus, in 2016 about two third of Italian Regions had
coverage rates lower than 90% [8].
In the last years, an important decreasing of vaccin-
ation coverage rates in childhood have been described
for tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis, Haemophilus influenza
type B, Hepatitis B, poliovirus, measles, mumps and
rubella. As a consequence, due to inadequate vaccination
coverage, infectious diseases spread [9].
Considering,
for
example,
measles
outbreaks
and
European scenario, recent outbreaks have occurred in
Romania (7570 cases), Italy (5006 cases), Ukraine (4667),
and Germany (891 cases). A percentage of 87% of cases
occurred in unvaccinated people [10].
These outbreaks have led to discussion on vaccination
policies in any European Countries. All the European Union
Countries have a long tradition of vaccination program but
there is still much that can be done to improve and acceler-
ate immunization coverage. In this European scenario, there

 are large differences between Countries considering the type
of vaccine used, number of doses and timing of vaccinations
but also differences in whether vaccinations are recom-
mended or mandatory.
In eleven out of thirty-one countries there is at least one
mandatory vaccine to increase immunization coverage.
There are many reasons why Italy and European Countries
are still not meeting immunisation needs. In particular, poor
understanding and false perceptions of vaccination by the
public and sometimes by health-care professionals and false
informations circulating by the mass media have damaged
parent’s confidence in vaccinations [11].
In Italy, until June 2017, only four vaccination were
mandatory (polio, diphtheria, tetanus and hepatitis B).
After a scientific among the Italian Scientific Society be-
longing to the “Vaccine Board” and the political commu-
nity, in February 2017, the Ministry of Health issued the
2017–2019 National Immunization Prevention Plan and
in July 2017 the law 119/2017 for compulsory vaccin-
ation have been approved [12–14] Italy approved a new
law to enforce mandatory childhood vaccinations in
2017, so that compulsory vaccines rise to 10 [11].
As described by Burioni et al., the new law is giving
good results [15]. In particular, an increase by 1 and
2.9% of polio and measles vaccine uptake respectively
have been shown. Moreover, almost one-third of the
previously unvaccinated children born in 2011–15 have
now been immunized [16].
As for vaccination coverage, encouraging results have re-
cently been reported: an increase of 1% from June to Octo-
ber 2017 for the hexavalent (tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis,
Haemophilus influenza type B, Hepatitis B, poliovirus) vac-
cine and of 2,9% for the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine.
In
order
to
contrast
Italian
vaccination
policies,
anti-vaccination campaigns contribute to the spread of
fake news. People who had been asked to vaccinate their
children have often been scared by fake news and by the
false information that Italy is the only one country with
mandatory vaccination policy.
“While it is preferable that high community demand
and acceptance make compulsory vaccination programs
unnecessary, World Health Organization (WHO) under-
stands that some Countries may wish to move in that
direction when faced with declining vaccination rates
and outbreaks of disease.” Moreover, “WHO is very in-
terested in learning from the experience of countries
who introduce compulsory vaccination in order to better
understand the impact on immunization coverage and
the strengths and weaknesses of such approaches” [17].
Conclusions
Not only in Italy, vaccines are mandatory in childhood.
Other countries adopted compulsory policies in order to
prevent the spread of infectious diseases.
