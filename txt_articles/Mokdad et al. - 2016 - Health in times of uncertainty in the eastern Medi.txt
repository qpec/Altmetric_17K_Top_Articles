Summary
Background The eastern Mediterranean region is comprised of 22 countries: Afghanistan, Bahrain, Djibouti, 
Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Morocco, Oman, Pakistan, Palestine, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, 
Somalia, Sudan, Syria, Tunisia, the United Arab Emirates, and Yemen. Since our Global Burden of Disease Study 
2010 (GBD 2010), the region has faced unrest as a result of revolutions, wars, and the so-called Arab uprisings. The 
objective of this study was to present the burden of diseases, injuries, and risk factors in the eastern Mediterranean 
region as of 2013.
Methods GBD 2013 includes an annual assessment covering 188 countries from 1990 to 2013. The study covers 
306 diseases and injuries, 1233 sequelae, and 79 risk factors. Our GBD 2013 analyses included the addition of new 
data through updated systematic reviews and through the contribution of unpublished data sources from 
collaborators, an updated version of modelling software, and several improvements in our methods. In this 
systematic analysis, we use data from GBD 2013 to analyse the burden of disease and injuries in the eastern 
Mediterranean region specifi
 cally.
Findings The leading cause of death in the region in 2013 was ischaemic heart disease (90·3 deaths per 100 000 people), 
which increased by 17·2% since 1990. However, diarrhoeal diseases were the leading cause of death in Somalia 
(186·7 deaths per 100 000 people) in 2013, which decreased by 26·9% since 1990. The leading cause of disability-
adjusted life-years (DALYs) was ischaemic heart disease for males and lower respiratory infection for females. High 
blood pressure was the leading risk factor for DALYs in 2013, with an increase of 83·3% since 1990. Risk factors for 
DALYs varied by country. In low-income countries, childhood wasting was the leading cause of DALYs in Afghanistan, 
Somalia, and Yemen, whereas unsafe sex was the leading cause in Djibouti. Non-communicable risk factors were the 
leading cause of DALYs in high-income and middle-income countries in the region. DALY risk factors varied by age, 
with child and maternal malnutrition aff
 ecting the younger age groups (aged 28 days to 4 years), whereas high

Introduction
The eastern Mediterranean region is comprised of 
22 countries: Afghanistan, Egypt, Bahrain, Djibouti, 
Iraq, Iran, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Morocco, 
Oman, Pakistan, Palestine, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, 
Somalia, Sudan, Syria, Tunisia, the United Arab 
Emirates, and Yemen. The region has a population of 
about 583 million people.1 Countries in the eastern 
Mediterranean region vary substantially in their 
gross domestic product, sociodemographic profi
 les, 
health indicators, and health system capacities and 
coverage.2,3
The political and economic situation in the region 
since 2010 has suff
 ered from continued unrest and the 
Arab uprisings. Revolutions and changes in government 
occurred in Egypt, Libya, Tunisia, and Yemen. A civil war 
is devastating Syria, and disturbances are common in 
Afghanistan, Bahrain, Iraq, Palestine, and Somalia. As a 
result, hundreds of thousands of civilians have been 
forced to fl
 ee and seek refuge.
In this Article, we present the burden of diseases, 
injuries, and risk factors in the eastern Mediterranean 
region from 1990 to 2013, with the aim to show the 
impact of war and unrest on the health of people in the 
region as of the end of 2013.
Methods
Study overview
The Global Burden of Disease Study 2013 (GBD 2013) 
includes an annual assessment covering 188 countries 
from 1990 to 2013. It covers 306 diseases and injuries, 
1233 sequelae, and 79 risk factors. Detailed descriptions 
bodyweight and systolic blood pressure aff
 ected older people (aged 60–80 years). The proportion of DALYs attributed 
to high body-mass index increased from 3·7% to 7·5% between 1990 and 2013. Burden of mental health problems 
and drug use increased. Most increases in DALYs, especially from non-communicable diseases, were due to 
population growth. The crises in Egypt, Yemen, Libya, and Syria have resulted in a reduction in life expectancy; life 
expectancy in Syria would have been 5 years higher than that recorded for females and 6 years higher for males had 
the crisis not occurred.
Interpretation Our study shows that the eastern Mediterranean region is going through a crucial health phase. The 
Arab uprisings and the wars that followed, coupled with ageing and population growth, will have a major impact on 
the region’s health and resources. The region has historically seen improvements in life expectancy and other health 
indicators, even under stress. However, the current situation will cause deteriorating health conditions for many 
countries and for many years and will have an impact on the region and the rest of the world. Based on our fi
 ndings, 
we call for increased investment in health in the region in addition to reducing the confl
 icts.

Research in context
Evidence before this study
The Global Burden of Disease Study 2010 (GBD 2010) became 
available in 2012. GBD 2010 reported on disability-adjusted 
life-years (DALYs), health-adjusted life expectancy, and 67 risks 
and risk clusters by 21 world regions and 188 countries. 
GBD 2010 covered 20 age and sex groups.
Added value of this study
GBD 2013 includes an annual assessment covering 
188 countries, from 1990 to 2013. It covers 306 diseases and 
injuries, 1233 sequelae, and 79 risk factors. GBD 2013 
included key methodological diff
 erences from GBD 2010, 
which were inclusion of new data through updated systematic 
reviews and through the contribution of unpublished data 
sources from many collaborators; use of a counterfactual 
approach for estimating diarrhoea and pneumonia causes; 
elaboration of the sequelae list to include asymptomatic 
states; use of more detailed nature of injury codes (N-codes); 
improvements to the Bayesian meta-regression method; 
increased simulation size for comorbidity; estimation of the 
prevalence of injuries by cohort; and use of a new method to 
estimate the distribution of mild, moderate, and severe 
anaemia by cause. This study provides an overview of the 
comprehensive burden of diseases and risk factors for the 
eastern Mediterranean region.
Implications of all the available evidence
The eastern Mediterranean region is facing numerous health 
challenges, as a result of previous wars, revolutions, the wars 
that followed, and ageing and population growth. These 
challenges will have a major impact on health outcomes and 
available resources. The region has historically seen 
improvements in life expectancy and other health indicators 
even under stress. However, according to our study, the current 
situation has resulted in deteriorating health conditions for 
many countries that are threatening these gains and will have 
an impact on the region and the rest of the world. On the basis 
of our data, we call for increased investment in health in the 
region and the end of ongoing confl
 icts.

of the method and approach of GBD 2013 have been 
published elsewhere.4–7 Key changes in the methods from 
GBD 2010 are the inclusion of new data through updated 
systematic reviews and the contribution of unpublished 
data sources from various collaborators; the use of a 
counterfactual approach for estimating causes of 
diarrhoea and pneumonia; elaboration of the sequelae list 
to include asymptomatic states; use of more detailed 
nature of injury codes (N-codes); improvements to the 
Bayesian meta-regression method; increased simulation 
size for comorbidity; estimation of the prevalence of 
injuries by cohort; and use of a new method to estimate 
the distribution of mild, moderate, and severe anaemia by 
cause. In this systematic analysis, we use data from GBD 
2013 to analyse the burden of disease and injuries in the 
eastern Mediterranean region specifi
 cally. We report 95% 
uncertainty intervals for each value in our analysis.
Mortality estimation
We generated child mortality rates and adult mortality 
rates under the infl
 uence of natural disasters and armed 
confl
 icts as previously described.7 Because of ongoing 
unrest and war, some datapoints needed for our analyses 
were not available. A list of all datapoints used in this 
study are available on our Global Health Data Exchange 
web page. When data were unavailable, we relied on our 
ensemble modelling techniques to generate the 
estimates using other available variables and the 
information for neighbouring countries or countries 
with a similar health profi
 le in the region. We used six 
diff
 erent modelling strategies for the 240 causes of 
death using our cause-of-death ensemble model for 
causes with suffi
  cient information. We estimated 
national time series from 1950 to 2013 for gross 
domestic product, educational attainment, tobacco 
prevalence, and obesity. For mortality rates of children 
younger than 5 years, we analysed all survey, census, 
sample registration, and vital registration sources. 
Wherever possible, we analysed microdata from surveys 
and censuses with updated methods for child mortality. 
We corrected for bias in diff
 erent sources in specifi
 c 
countries. For adult mortality, we identifi
 ed all available 
vital registration data, sibling history survey data, 
sample registration data, and household recall of deaths. 
We assessed vital registration data for completeness and 
analysed sibling history data to account for survivor 
bias, zero-surviving sibships, and recall bias. We used 
spatiotemporal regression and Gaussian process 
regression to synthesise all measurements of mortality. 
We used UN population estimates that account for 
migration in our analyses. Moreover, we applied 
mortality shocks based on multiple reports to 
our analyses.
Eff
 ects of risk factors on disease burden
We used the comparative risk assessment approach to 
evaluate how much of the burden of disease observed in 
a given year can be attributed to past exposure to a risk 
factor.7 We estimated attributable burden by comparing 
observed health outcomes with outcomes that would 
have been observed if an alternative or counterfactual 
level of exposure had taken place in the past. We used 
the exposure level that minimises risk for the 
population, termed the theoretical minimum risk 
exposure level. We avoided double counting in the 
presentation of overall results by computing the overlap 
for joint risk distributions: behavioural risks alone; 
environmental or occupational risks alone; metabolic 
risks 
alone; 
behavioural 
and 
environmental 
or 
occupational risks together; behavioural and metabolic 
risks together; environmental or occupational and 
metabolic risks together; and behavioural, environ-
mental or occupational, and metabolic risks together.
Disaggregation
We cross-tabulated the quantiles of disability-adjusted 
life-years (DALYs) by quintiles of annual DALY increase 
from 1990 to 2013 to show rates of DALY increase by 
burden. We divided the region into three categories 
according to the gross national income (GNI) per capita. 
The fi
 rst category represents the low-income countries 
with an average GNI per capita of US$523·3 On the 
opposite end of the spectrum are oil-rich, high-income 
countries with an average GNI per capita of $39 688. The 
nations that lie in between are the middle-income 
countries with an average GNI per capita of $3251, which 
can be further subdivided into lower-middle-income and 
upper-middle-income countries. Low-income countries 
were Afghanistan, Djibouti, Somalia, and Yemen. 
Middle-income countries were Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, 
Lebanon, Libya, Morocco, Pakistan, Palestine, Sudan, 
Syria, and Tunisia. High-income countries were Bahrain, 
Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab 
Emirates.

The funder of the study had no role in study design, data 
collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of 
the report. The corresponding author had full access to

Results
The leading cause of death in the eastern Mediterranean 
region in 2013 was ischaemic heart disease (90·3 deaths 
per 100 000 people).8 It surpassed both diarrhoeal 
diseases and lower respiratory infections as the leading 
cause of death in 1990, increasing by 17·2%. There was a 
shift in main causes of death from communicable to 
non-communicable diseases in the region. Causes of 
death and their rates of change varied by country.8 For 
example, diarrhoeal disease was the leading cause of 
death in Somalia and accounted for 186·7 deaths per 
100 000 people in 2013, a decrease of 26·9% from 1990.9

All countries observed an increase in life expectancy and 
healthy life expectancy since 1990, although at diff
 erent 
rates (appendix pp 7–8). Afghanistan had the lowest life 
expectancy and healthy life expectancy (56·5 years vs 
49·0 years for men, 56·0 years vs 48·8 years for women, 
respectively), whereas Qatar had the highest (81·2 years 
vs 69·2 years for men, 83·1 years vs 69·5 years for 
women, respectively). Lebanon had a higher increase in 
healthy life expectancy than life expectancy. Global life 
expectancy for both sexes increased from 65·3 years in 
1990, to 71·5 years in 2013.4
There was a change in causes of years of life lost (YLLs) 
from 1990 to 2013 in all countries (appendix p 9). Overall, 
regional YLLs decreased from 45 312 years per 
100 000 people in 1990 to about 24 160 years per 
100 000 people in 2013.8 Cardiovascular diseases, 
neoplasms, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and 
transport injuries increased, especially in high-income 
and 
middle-income 
countries 
in 
the 
region, 
whereas neonatal disorders, diarrhoeal diseases, and 
lower respiratory infections decreased. HIV/AIDS and 
tuberculosis were large contributors to YLLs in 2013 in

Djibouti. War was a large contributor to YLLs in Syria in 
2013 (38·1% of total YLLs).8
Overall, regional years lived with disability (YLDs) 
increased from 9526 years per 100 000 people in 1990 to 
about 10 057 years per 100 000 people in 2013.8 
Musculoskeletal disorders and mental disorders and 
substance abuse were major contributors to YLDs in 
2013 and had the highest increase (appendix p 10). 
Nutritional defi
 ciencies (mainly iron-defi
 ciency anaemia) 
decreased in the region overall, but remained a large 
burden in low-income countries. For example, nutritional 
defi
 ciencies remained one of the leading causes of YLDs 
in Yemen although the YLDs per 100 000 people 
decreased slightly by 2% from 1990.8
Overall, regional DALYs decreased from 54 838 years 
per 100 000 people in 1990 to about 34 217 years 
per 100 000 people in 2013. DALYs vary disproportionately 
by age and sex. Children younger than 5 years 
contributed to about 33% of total DALYs with a rate of 
94 884 years per 100 000 people, compared with 
34 217 years per 100 000 people for the general 
population.8 Ischaemic heart disease was the leading

cause of DALYs in the region in 2013 in males and when 
data for both sexes were combined, whereas diarrhoeal 
diseases were the leading cause in 1990 (table 1). Lower 
respiratory infection was the leading cause of DALYs for 
females. Causes of DALYs varied by income; lower 
respiratory infection was the leading cause of DALYs in 
low-income countries (appendix p 15), ischaemic heart 
disease in middle-income countries (appendix p 16), 
and road injuries in high-income countries (appendix 
p 17). Causes of DALYs and their change from 1990 by 
country varied widely (appendix p 11). Causes of DALYs 
varied by age. For example, DALYs for mental health 
peaked in early adulthood and declined with age, 
whereas DALYs for cardiovascular diseases and 
neoplasms increased with age (appendix p 1). Diff
 erent 
patterns of DALYs were observed in diff
 erent income 
levels (appendix pp 12–14).
High blood pressure was the leading risk factor for 
DALYs in 2013, which increased by 83·3% from 1990 
(from 8·5 million to 16·1 million DALYs; table 2;8 
however, the number of DALYs per 100 000 people 
increased by only 14%. High blood pressure increased 
from the fi
 fth highest cause of DALYs in 1990 to fi
 rst in 
2013. Risk factors for DALYs varied by country, with 
childhood wasting as the leading cause in Somalia, 
Afghanistan, and Yemen, whereas unsafe sex was the 
leading cause of DALYs in Djibouti. Conversely, non-
communicable disease risk factors were the leading 
cause of DALYs in high-income countries and middle-
income countries (fi
 gure 1). DALY risk factors varied by 
age; child malnutrition and suboptimal breastfeeding 
aff
 ected the younger age groups (aged 7 days to 4 years) 
and high bodyweight and systolic blood pressure 
aff
 ected the older age groups (aged 60–80 years; 
appendix p 2).
The annualised rates of change for DALY risk factors 
by burden for the region, low-income, middle-income, 
and high-income countries are shown in the appendix 
(pp 3–6). DALYs per 100 000 people attributed to high 
body-mass index increased by 28% from 1990 to 2013 
(from 1961 years per 100 000 people to 2506 years per 
100 000 people) and accounted for over 7·3% of total 
DALYs.8 For high-income countries, high fasting plasma 
glucose, high body-mass index, alcohol use, and drug 
use accounted for the highest annual increase with a 
high DALYs burden.
Decomposition tables for the impact of ageing and 
population growth on the changes in DALYs from 
communicable diseases, non-communicable diseases, 
and injuries for the region are shown in table 3, and in 
the appendix (pp 18–21) for low-income, middle-
income, and high-income countries. DALYs caused by 
non-communicable diseases and injuries increased 
(mainly because of population growth), whereas DALYs 
caused by communicable diseases decreased, although 
the actual rates of DALYs decreased for all risk factors 
(table 3).
Projected life expectancy using fi
 gures from 2009 
until 2013, based on the trends observed from 1990 to 
2008 compared with observed life expectancy from GBD 
2013 are shown in fi
 gures 2 and 3. From 1990 to 2010, 
Egypt, Libya, Syria, and Yemen had a steady increase in 
life expectancy of about 0·25 years per year, with a 
slightly higher increase in females (about 0·3 years) 
than in males. However, Egypt, Tunisia, and Yemen 
have lost about 0·25 years of life expectancy due to the 
uprising that began in 2010. When comparing observed 
life expectancy to expected life expectancy if no crisis 
had occurred, we found a large decrease in life 
expectancy in Libya of more than 9 years for males and 
6 years for females. Conversely, a steady decrease in life 
expectancy was observed in Syria because of the 
continuing war. Therefore, between 1990 and 2013 life 
expectancy for Syria would have been 6 years higher 
than observed for males and 5 years higher for females 
had the crisis not happened. Moreover, our analyses 
showed that several countries in the region have 
experienced a slow-down in lowering infant mortality 
rate. For example, in Syria the annualised rate of 
reduction in infant mortality between 2010 to 2013 was 
–9·1%, in sharp contrast with the rate of decrease of 
6·0% before 2010.9
Discussion
The eastern Mediterranean region is facing numerous 
health challenges as a result of previous wars, recent 
revolutions, and the wars that followed, and of ageing 
and population growth. Life expectancy at birth in the 
region increased from 65 years in 1990 to 71 years in 
2013, with an annual increase of about 0·26 years. 
However, according to our study, the situation has 
resulted in deteriorating health conditions for many 
countries that are threatening these gains and will 
have an impact on the region and worldwide. Hence, 
on the basis of our results, we call for increased 
investment in health in the region, and suppression of 
the confl
 icts.
Our study showed a rapid increase in the burden of 
mental and drug-use disorders in the region. 
Unfortunately, the rise in burden of mental health 
problems has not been met with investment in 
prevention by most countries in the region, with few 
exceptions, such as Lebanon and Qatar.10,11 Mental 
health is not viewed as a major burden by many 
countries and is not discussed in the agendas of many 
international agencies and health ministries. We hope 
that our fi
 ndings will shed light and lead to more 
attention by global and regional health agencies to 
tackle this rising burden.
Similarly, the rapid rise in non-communicable 
diseases is alarming. Diabetes, for example, is a heavy 
burden on many countries, with deaths increasing from 
12 to 19 per 100 000 people. One study12 showed a high 
cost of diabetes in Saudi Arabia. These trends,

irrespective of their cause, will lead to a strain on 
fi
 nances and human resources in a region where they 
are already scarce. The prevention and control of risk 
factors associated with non-communicable diseases 
should be a priority for the region.
The spread of communicable diseases in the eastern 
Mediterranean region is of concern. The Hajj annual 
pilgrimage presents a challenge to health planners. The 
mass gathering for Hajj has led to several outbreaks of 
infectious disease such as meningitis and polio in 
Saudi Arabia and other countries.13 Moreover, the 
gathering in Iraq for Ashura, a day of mass mourning, 
has the same potential for the spread of disease.14 
In most of these countries, kissing is a normal way 
of greeting people, and sharing food and social 
congregations are common. This cultural behaviour 
has complicated eff
 orts to control Middle East 
respiratory syndrome (MERS) outbreaks in Saudi 
Arabia and its spread to other countries.15 Containment 
and control of emerging diseases and infections in the 
eastern Mediterranean region is a national interest for 
all countries.
Our study showed a rise in the burden of disease due 
to illicit drugs in the region. Several studies have 
reported that, during stress, individuals might engage 
in risky behaviours.16 Unfortunately, the response of 
many countries has been law enforcement measures 
and strict punishment.17 The region is in need of 
comprehensive socioculturally appropriate approaches 
towards education, prevention, and early identifi
 cation 
and treatment.
Road-traffi
  c injuries are the leading cause of DALYs 
in men in high-income countries throughout the 
region, and rank increasingly higher in low-income 
and middle-income countries than in previous years. 
Unfortunately, many countries in the region have yet 
to fully implement policies and legislation conducive 
to road safety, and need to strengthen their trauma care 
systems.18
One of the main challenges and threats for the region 
is the environment. Most countries in the region are 
facing water shortages due to population pressure, 
increasing 
water 
demand, 
and 
natural 
climate 
variability. Moreover, climate change has resulted in 
increased temperatures in the region, and a major 
part of the eastern Mediterranean region is projected 
to be uninhabitable in the next 50–80 years.19 
Additionally, most countries in the region are not food 
suffi
  cient and rely heavily on imports to meet growing 
demands. Development of a plan to address these 
issues is crucial for the region and the world, 
because they will aff
 ect the stability and future of the 
region.
Unrest, civil confl
 icts, and wars have had a big impact 
on the burden of disease in the eastern Mediterranean 
region. However, the long-term impact of the unrest is 
not yet known. The region is losing its health talents, as

many medical doctors and health professionals leave 
confl
 ict areas in search of a better life elsewhere.20 
Moreover, historically high rates of unemployment in 
the region have caused many other people to seek work 
elsewhere.
Many countries in the region are facing other health 
challenges that they are not equipped for. For example, 
the conflict in Syria has resulted in millions of 
individuals being displaced internally and millions of 
others forced to seek refuge in neighbouring 
countries. Only when an influx of Syrian refugees into 
Europe occurred did this crisis receive widespread 
media coverage. There is a need for long-term 
planning to improve the health of and stabilise the 
region.
The infrastructure in several of these countries has 
been destroyed because of war. Water and sanitation 
will pose major challenges until proper reconstruction 
is achieved. Unfortunately, these eff
 ects will lead to an 
increased rate of disease spread and outbreaks, which 
must be properly controlled. Moreover, investment in 
health information systems in the region is urgently 
needed. This investment should be a priority for 
countries and donors once the political situation 
improves.
Our study showed that many of the health gains 
achieved by countries in the region are at risk of slowing 
down. In fact, infant mortality has risen in some 
countries. It is sad to see that Syria, a country with a good 
performance in reducing child mortality in the past, saw 
a rise from 2010 to 2013. Syria is falling behind countries 
in sub-Saharan Africa when it comes to the rate of change 
in infant mortality.
The political situation in the region continues to be 
uncertain; since 2013, the wars in Syria and Libya have 
escalated, and a war has started in Yemen. In some 
areas, residents are facing starvation and the public 
health and medical systems are about to collapse. 
Moreover, wars and unrest in Afghanistan, Iraq, 
Palestine, and Somalia have continued or re-emerged, 
and for many people in these countries, survival is the 
main challenge, not health. The eastern Mediterranean 
region is facing several health challenges at a time of 
uncertainty, and the countries in this region are 
struggling to meet these challenges.
Events in the past 5 years have shown that the 
wellbeing of people in the eastern Mediterranean region 
crosses beyond its borders, as exemplifi
 ed by the spread 
of MERS to South Korea and the outbreak of infectious 
diseases in refugee camps in Lebanon and Jordan. 
A healthy eastern Mediterranean region is a politically 
stable eastern Mediterranean region, one from which 
the whole world will benefi
 t. Based on our fi
 ndings, we 
call for stepping up eff
 orts at the regional and local levels 
to improve health, identify barriers to scaling up health 
promotion and disease prevention services, and to 
stabilise the region.
