Abstract
IMPORTANCE—Spontaneous preterm birth is a leading cause of infant mortality. Prediction, 
largely based on prior pregnancy outcomes, is not possible in women pregnant for the first time.
OBJECTIVE—To assess the accuracy of universal screening to predict spontaneous preterm birth 
in nulliparous women using serial measurements of vaginal fetal fibronectin levels and cervical 
length.
DESIGN, SETTINGS, AND PARTICIPANTS—A prospective observational cohort study of 
nulliparous women with singleton pregnancies, from 8 clinical sites across the United States 
between October 2010 and May 2014. Women and clinicians were blinded to results unless 
cervical shortening less than 15 mm was identified.
EXPOSURES—Transvaginal cervical length and quantitative vaginal fetal fibronectin levels 
were reviewed at 2 study visits 4 or more weeks apart.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES—Spontaneous preterm birth at less than 37 weeks was 
the primary outcome. Cervical length and quantitative fetal fibronectin were considered 
independently and together at each visit. Measurement distributions were compared for 
spontaneous preterm birth vs all other births. Spontaneous preterm birth before 32 weeks was a 
secondary outcome.
RESULTS—The study included 9410 women (median age, 27.0 [interquartile range, 9.0] years; 
60.7% non-Hispanic white, 13.8% non-Hispanic black, 16.5% Hispanic, 4.0% Asian, and 5.1% 
other), of whom 474 (5.0%) had spontaneous preterm births, 335 (3.6%) had medically indicated 
preterm births, and 8601 (91.4%) had term births. Among women with spontaneous preterm birth, 
cervical length of 25 mm or less occurred in 35 of 439 (8.0%) at 16 to 22 weeks’ gestation and in 
94 of 403 (23.3%) at 22 to 30 weeks’ gestation. Fetal fibronectin levels of 50 ng/mL or greater at 
16 to 22 weeks identified 30 of 410 women (7.3%) with spontaneous preterm birth and 31 of 384 
(8.1%) at 22 to 30 weeks. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for screening 
between 22 and 30 weeks for fetal fibronectin level alone was 0.59 (95% CI, 0.56–0.62), for 
transvaginal cervical length alone was 0.67 (95% CI, 0.64–0.70), and for the combination as 
continuous variables was 0.67 (95% CI, 0.64–0.70).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE—Among nulliparous women with singleton pregnancies, 
quantitative vaginal fetal fibronectin and serial transvaginal ultrasound cervical length had low 
predictive accuracy for spontaneous preterm birth. These findings do not support routine use of 
these tests in such women.
Preterm birth, affecting approximately 12% of the deliveries in the United States, was 
responsible for 35% of the world’s 3.1 million annual neonatal deaths in 2006.1 Although 
rates have decreased over the past decade, health care costs and long-term health 
consequences for children born preterm are enormous, reaching more than $26.2 billion, or 
$51 600 for every infant born prematurely in the United States in 2006.2 Current strategies

 to identify women at risk are largely based on prior pregnancy outcomes, but risk assessment 
in women pregnant for the first time is difficult. Short cervical length has been associated 
with an increased risk of preterm birth in some studies.3,4 Randomized trials demonstrating 
reduced rates of premature birth in women with a short cervix treated with vaginal 
progesterone5,6 have prompted consideration of universal ultrasound screening for short 
cervix.7–9 Despite the fact that the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists 
does not recommend routine screening in low-risk populations, routine evaluation of cervical 
length in all patients is a common practice.10
A positive qualitative test for fetal fibronectin in cervicovaginal fluid is also associated with 
premature birth risk, but the sensitivity and positive predictive value (PPV) are low, and 
there are no known treatments for women with a positive test result.11,12 However, use of 
quantitative, rather than qualitative, fetal fibronectin measures may improve accuracy of this 
test.13
The combination of transvaginal cervical length and fetal fibronectin levels to identify 
women at risk has been studied, with conflicting results.14,15 The current study was designed 
to assess the accuracy of universal screening using serial transvaginal cervical length and 
quantitative measurement of fetal fibronectin levels to predict spontaneous preterm birth in a 
large, prospective cohort of nulliparous women.
Methods
Participants and Recruitment
The Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development 
established the Nulliparous Pregnancy Outcomes Study: Monitoring Mothers-to-Be 
(nuMoM2b) to study nulliparous women with an overarching goal to identify factors that 
predict adverse pregnancy outcomes such as spontaneous preterm birth.16 The study is a 
prospective cohort study with a target recruitment of 10 000 nulliparous women. Nulliparous 
women with singleton pregnancies were recruited from hospitals in 8 clinical centers in the 
United States. All local institutional review boards approved the study protocol. Participants 
provided written informed consent. A detailed description of study methods and procedures 
is available.16
Pregnant women who planned to deliver their infants at one of the clinical site hospitals 
were recruited before 14 weeks’ gestational age. Women were invited to participate if they 
had a viable singleton gestation, were between 6 weeks 0 days of gestation and 13 weeks 6 
days of gestation based on a documented ultrasound crown-rump length measurement by a 
certified study sonographer, and were nulliparous, defined as having had no prior pregnancy 
lasting 20 weeks or more based on self-report.
Maternal race/ethnicity was self-reported by participants in response to prespecified options 
defined by the investigators. Race/ethnicity was used in this report to demonstrate that this 
population represents the overall racial and ethnic distribution of the general pregnant 
population in the United States.

 Primary Outcome
Spontaneous preterm birth, defined as delivery before 37 weeks 0 days of gestation 
occurring subsequent to spontaneous onset of labor or premature rupture of the membranes, 
regardless of subsequent labor augmentation or cesarean delivery, was the primary outcome. 
Pregnancy losses before 20 weeks’ gestation and pregnancy terminations were excluded. 
Spontaneous preterm birth was documented by chart abstraction by certified research 
personnel. Women without spontaneous labor or premature rupture of the membranes and 
who were delivered by their physician before 37 weeks’ gestation (for example, for 
preeclampsia, intrauterine growth restriction, or maternal indications) were included in the 
control group. Spontaneous preterm birth occurring before 32 weeks 0 days of gestation was 
prospectively identified as a secondary outcome.
Study Visits
Participants completed 3 study visits: visit 1, between 6 weeks 0 days and 14 weeks 6 days 
of gestation (median, 12.4 weeks); visit 2, between 16 weeks 0 days and 22 weeks 6 days of 
gestation (median, 19.0 weeks); and visit 3, between 22 weeks 0 days and 30 weeks 6 days 
of gestation (median, 28.0 weeks), allowing a 1-week extension from the protocol windows 
because of mistimed visits. For each participant, all study visits were at least 4 weeks apart. 
Detailed interviews were performed at each visit to collect demographic characteristics, 
medical history, and other pertinent clinical data. After delivery, final chart abstraction was 
performed by trained research staff to document and confirm key clinical outcomes.
Fetal Fibronectin
During visit 1, visit 2, and visit 3, participants were given 3 swabs: 1 swab for a fetal 
fibronectin test and 2 polyethylene terephthalate (Dacron) swabs for other tests. Fibronectin 
test kits were provided without charge by Hologic Inc. Participants were instructed to insert 
the 2 Dacron swabs together about 2 inches into the vagina and rotate the swabs around for 
30 seconds, making sure to touch the walls of the vagina to absorb fluid. They were 
instructed to repeat this procedure with the fetal fibronectin swab. The fetal fibronectin swab 
was then placed in a tube containing buffer solution, barcoded, and stored at −80°C for 
shipment to Hologic for assay.
All fetal fibronectin samples were analyzed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay as 
previously described (Hologic Inc). Individuals performing fetal fibronectin laboratory 
analysis were masked to pregnancy outcomes.
Transvaginal Cervical Length Measurement
Participants underwent transvaginal ultrasound to measure transvaginal cervical length at 
visits 2 and 3 using a previously described technique.16 All persons performing transvaginal 
cervical length measurements were required to complete an educational module and submit 
3 images from each of 5 pregnant women for review by a single reviewer (J.D.I.) using 
published criteria or to have been previously credentialed using the same process and 
reviewer for other research studies.17

 Study visits were not part of clinical care. Research participants, clinicians, and those 
performing the chart reviews were blinded to the results of the transvaginal ultrasonography 
and fetal fibronectin assays. Those performing the fetal fibronectin assays were blinded to 
the cervical length results. Research data were communicated to the clinician only when an 
ultrasound revealed major fetal structural malformation, hydrops, fetal demise, estimated 
fetal weight less than fifth percentile, oligohydramnios, cervical length less than 15 mm 
before 28 weeks, fetal bradycardia or tachycardia, or placenta or vasa previa found at the 
third study visit. Clinical care of women found to have a short cervix was left to the 
discretion of the referring physician.
Statistical Analysis
Study participants with pregnancies carried 20 weeks or more were eligible for this analysis. 
Women with pregnancy outcome data and at least 1 visit at which either fetal fibronectin or 
cervical length were obtained were included. Fetal fibronectin and cervical length were 
considered as individual screening tools at each study visit for spontaneous preterm birth 
using previously described thresholds (cervical length ≤20 mm or ≤25 mm; fetal fibronectin 
levels ≥10, ≥50, and ≥200 ng/mL),3,4,8 and we investigated all potential thresholds using 
receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Rates of change in the measurements relative 
to the weeks elapsed between visits were also assessed, and multiple logistic regression 
models were used to combine information on fetal fibronectin levels and cervical length in 
prediction of spontaneous preterm birth. Test characteristics, including sensitivity, 
specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and likelihood ratios, were computed for 
selected thresholds and Mann-Whitney U statistics provided estimates of the areas under the 
ROC curves (AUCs). The method of Delong, Delong, and Clarke-Pearson was used for 
comparing AUCs.18
The assay range for fetal fibronectin was reported by the laboratory analyst at Hologic as 0 
to 500 ng/mL. Reported values greater than 500 were set to 500, and an indicator variable 
for outside the assay range was included with the measurement in a multiple logistic 
regression model to assess fetal fibronectin measurement as an individual screening tool. 
Before using cervical length and fetal fibronectin level together, the distributions of the 
measurements were reviewed for departures from normality. Fetal fibronectin measurements 
were highly skewed to the left, and Box-Cox log transformations19 were taken, identifying 
the reciprocal square root transformation best in normalizing the data. Thus, the multiple 
logistic regression model combining cervical length and fetal fibronectin level included 
cervical length on the original scale, fetal fibronectin level on the reciprocal square root 
scale, and an indicator for fetal fibronectin level outside the assay range. The Hosmer-
Lemeshow test20 was used to evaluate goodness-of-fit in the model combining cervical 
length and fetal fibronectin values.
Generally, characteristics and measurements were contrasted between groups using 
Wilcoxon rank sum tests for distributions of measurements on a continuous scale, and χ2 
tests for categorical data.
By protocol, women were informed of cervical length measurements less than 15 mm at a 
study visit, and their clinician may have opted to treat with progesterone for preterm birth.

 We performed a post hoc sensitivity analysis in which women given progesterone after 16 
weeks’ gestation were included as spontaneous preterm births (regardless of actual 
pregnancy outcome) when calculating AUCs for cervical length in prediction of spontaneous 
preterm birth.
All tests in this report were performed at a nominal significance level of α = .05; all tests 
with 1 df were 2-sided; and no correction was made for multiple comparisons. Analyses 
were conducted using SAS version 9.3/9.4 (SAS Institute Inc).
Results
Between October 2010 and May 2014 (date of last delivery), the parent protocol enrolled 
and followed up 10 038 women.16 Of these, 459 were excluded because of missing 
pregnancy outcome data and 110 were excluded who had a pregnancy loss prior to 20 
weeks’ gestation or a pregnancy termination, leaving 9469 women for analysis (Figure 1). 
Of these, 477 (5%) experienced a spontaneous preterm birth and 8992 (95%) experienced 
either a term birth or a nonspontaneous preterm birth. There were 3 women with 
spontaneous preterm births and 56 women with other births who did not have at least 1 
documented transvaginal cervical length or fetal fibronectin measurement; these women also 
were excluded from the analysis, leaving 474 spontaneous preterm birth cases and 8936 
other birth controls (335 medically indicated preterm births and 8601 term births). There 
were 303 women with a cervical length measurement less than 15 mm.
Baseline demographic characteristics of the study population are presented in Table 1. 
Overall, the women had a median age of 27.0 (interquartile range, 9.0) years; 60.7% were 
non-Hispanic white, 13.8% non-Hispanic black, 16.5% Hispanic, 4.0% Asian, and 5.1% 
other race/ethnicity or multiracial. Women who experienced a spontaneous preterm birth 
were more likely to be at the extremes of maternal age, to have smoked in the 3 months prior 
to pregnancy, to have fewer years of education, to be single and never married, and to have 
preexisting diabetes compared with controls. The groups did not differ with respect to race 
and ethnicity, body mass index, or preexisting hypertension. eTable 1 in the Supplement 
contrasts baseline demographic characteristics for study participants with and without 
outcome data. Those without outcome data tended to be younger, less educated, more often 
of minority race/ethnicity, and more often single.
The relationship between transvaginal cervical length and spontaneous preterm birth is 
presented in Table 2. Women with spontaneous preterm births (cases) before 37 weeks had 
shorter transvaginal cervical length measurements than those with other births (controls) at 
visit 2 (median cervical length, 36 mm [25th–75th percentiles, 31 to 41] for cases vs 39 mm 
[25th–75th percentiles, 35 to 44] for controls; P < .001) and visit 3 (median cervical length, 
32 mm [25th–75th percentiles, 26 to 38] for cases vs 37 mm [25th–75th percentiles, 32 to 
42] for controls; P < .001). Cervical length was significantly shorter for those with 
spontaneous preterm birth before 32 weeks compared with controls at both visit 2 (median 
cervical length, 32 mm [25th–75th percentiles, 26 to 37] for cases vs 39 mm [25th–75th 
percentiles, 35 to 44] for controls; P < .001) and visit 3 (median cervical length, 20 mm 
[25th–75th percentiles, 4 to 33] for cases vs 37 mm [25th–75th percentiles, 32 to 42] for

 controls; P < .001). Also, transvaginal cervical length decreased to a greater degree between 
visit 2 and visit 3 for those with spontaneous preterm birth (median rate of change, −0.55 
mm/wk [25th–75th percentiles, −1.36 to 0.01] for cases vs −0.23 mm/wk [25th–75th 
percentiles, −0.83 to 0.28] for controls; P < .001). A transvaginal cervical length of 25 mm 
or less identified 35 of 439 women (8.0%) with spontaneous preterm birth before 37 weeks 
at visit 2 and 94 of 403 (23.3%) at visit 3.
The relationship between fetal fibronectin level and spontaneous preterm birth is presented 
in Table 2. Higher percentages of samples with fetal fibronectin values of 10 ng/mL or 
greater, 50 ng/mL or greater, and 200 ng/mL or greater were found in the spontaneous 
preterm birth group compared with the control group. Use of the most commonly accepted 
threshold of 50 ng/mL or greater identified 87 of 411 women (21.2%) with spontaneous 
preterm birth at visit 1, 30 of 410 (7.3%) at visit 2, and 31 of 384 (8.1%) at visit 3. The 
changes from visit 1 to visit 2 and visit 2 to visit 3 were different between women with 
spontaneous preterm births and those with other births but in opposite directions for visit 1 
to visit 2 vs visit 2 to visit 3.
The predictive capabilities of commonly reported thresholds of quantitative fetal fibronectin 
level and transvaginal cervical length at each study visit are summarized in Table 3 and 
Table 4. All thresholds had low PPV, with a high of 20.8% for transvaginal cervical length 
and a high of 14.0% for fetal fibronectin level in prediction of spontaneous preterm birth at 
less than 37 weeks; and highs of 8.6% and 5.6%, respectively, in prediction of preterm birth 
at less than 32 weeks.
ROC curves are shown in Figure 2 for fetal fibronectin and transvaginal cervical length 
individually and combined at visit 3 for prediction of spontaneous preterm birth before 37 
weeks of gestation. The AUC was highest for transvaginal cervical length (0.67 [95% CI, 
0.64–0.70]), compared with fetal fibronectin level (0.59 [95% CI, 0.56–0.62]) (P < .001). 
Combining fetal fibronectin level with transvaginal cervical length resulted in no additional 
benefit, with an AUC of 0.67 (95% CI, 0.64–0.70), and the model combining these measures 
was assessed to have adequate fit (Hosmer-Lemeshow 
, P = .30). Overlaid plots of 
sensitivity and specificity over a range of cutoff values for cervical length and quantitative 
fetal fibronectin at visit 3 are provided as eFigures 1 and 2 in the Supplement. Sensitivity 
plus specificity was maximized for cervical length at a cutoff of 31.7 mm and for 
quantitative fetal fibronectin at a cutoff of 7.077 ng/mL.
For both transvaginal cervical length and fetal fibronectin level, AUC measures for visit 3 
alone vs the rate of change from visit 2 to visit 3 were compared. AUCs for the change 
between visit 2 and visit 3 were lower for transvaginal cervical length (rate of change vs 
visit 3, 0.61 [95% CI, 0.58–0.64] vs 0.67 [95% CI, 0.64–0.70], respectively; P < .001) and 
not significantly different for fetal fibronectin (rate of change vs visit 3, 0.57 [95% CI, 0.53–
0.60] vs 0.59 [95% CI, 0.56–0.62], respectively; P = .10).
Seven hundred forty-two women (8.0%) had a transvaginal cervical length of 25 mm or less 
at visit 2 or visit 3, and 66 of these women (8.9%) received progesterone therapy after 16 
weeks’ gestation. In a post hoc sensitivity analysis, when women given progesterone

 treatment (eg, because of the finding of a short cervix) were considered as if they would 
have experienced a spontaneous preterm birth had they not received it, the AUC for the use 
of transvaginal cervical length at visit 3 to predict transvaginal cervical length was 
essentially unchanged (0.70 [95% CI, 0.67–0.73] for the sensitivity analysis compared with 
0.67 [95% CI, 0.64–0.70] for the original analysis).
Discussion
Quantitative fetal fibronectin and transvaginal cervical length had poor predictive 
performance as screening tests for spontaneous preterm birth before 37 weeks in nulliparous 
women. All screening modalities had relatively low sensitivity and PPV. The sensitivity of 
transvaginal cervical length for spontaneous preterm birth before 32 weeks was higher than 
for 37 weeks but also had low PPV. Understanding these limitations, transvaginal cervical 
length at 22 to 30 weeks’ gestation was the single most accurate predictor of spontaneous 
preterm birth before 37 weeks, having an AUC across all potential thresholds that was 
higher than fetal fibronectin assessment alone. However, the most commonly used clinical 
cutoff (threshold of 25 mm or less) identified a minority (23.3%) of spontaneous preterm 
births before 37 weeks. Screening with transvaginal cervical length using a similar cutoff of 
25 mm or less between 16 and 22 weeks, the most common time for screening in current 
clinical practice, in the epoch required for treatment with progesterone, identified only 8.0% 
of subsequent spontaneous preterm births. The addition of quantitative fetal fibronectin to 
transvaginal cervical length measurement did not increase the predictive performance of 
transvaginal cervical length alone.
Despite low sensitivity and predictive value, cervical length is the only predictor for which 
an effective intervention is potentially available. Universal cervical length screening has 
been proposed based on studies in which vaginal progesterone was shown to reduce the 
incidence of spontaneous preterm birth in women with a cervical length of 20 mm or less.21 
The utility of this approach depends on the frequency of short cervix in the population being 
screened, the number of cases of spontaneous preterm birth that can be identified, and the 
efficacy of the treatment. In the large nulliparous population reported here, short cervix was 
uncommon; only 1.0% had a cervical length of 15 mm or less between 16 and 22 weeks. 
This is slightly less than rates found in 2 of 3 prospective interventional trials that screened 
singleton pregnancies but is similar to recent observational reports.9 To et al22 found that 
1.0% of women had a cervical length 15 mm or less at 22 to 24 weeks, while Fonseca et al6 
reported a rate of 1.7% and Hassan et al5 noted that 2.3% of women had similar cervical 
lengths. The low incidence of cervical shortening limits the utility of this screening test. 
Using the most conservative threshold of 25 mm or less in the most common time for 
clinical screening (16–22 weeks’ gestation), 247 women would need to be screened to 
identify 1 case of spontaneous preterm birth before 37 weeks’ gestation. Using a threshold 
of transvaginal cervical length of 15 mm or less at 16 to 22 weeks’ gestation, 680 women 
would need to be screened to identify 1 case of spontaneous preterm birth before 37 weeks 
in this population. The same statistic (680 to screen) applied for a threshold of transvaginal 
cervical length of 20 mm or less at 16 to 22 weeks’ gestation in this population.

 In studies of cervicovaginal fetal fibronectin measurement to predict premature births before 
36 to 37 weeks, sensitivity (10%)11,23 and PPV have been low.24–26 Several retrospective 
studies using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay–based measurements of fetal fibronectin 
level indicate that risk of preterm birth is proportional to cervicovaginal fluid fetal 
fibronectin concentration.27,28 This study considered multiple thresholds and gestational 
ages for testing. The findings of the present study, with a maximum PPV of only 14.0% and 
a negative predictive value of 96.1%, indicate that fetal fibronectin level, regardless of the 
threshold, is not useful as a screening test in nulliparous patients.
Previous attempts to use a combination of fetal fibronectin level and transvaginal cervical 
length to predict spontaneous preterm birth have focused primarily on women at high risk 
for this outcome.14 These studies suggest that use of quantitative fetal fibronectin followed 
by cervical length can enhance the predictive capabilities of quantitative fetal fibronectin 
alone. Although the use of sequential screening was not evaluated, assessment of the 
contemporaneous combination of fetal fibronectin level and transvaginal cervical length as 
continuous measures found that quantitative fetal fibronectin did not improve the predictive 
capabilities of transvaginal cervical length alone in low-risk nulliparous women. Tests with 
relatively poor test characteristics may sometimes be useful if they are inexpensive, lack 
serious adverse effects of testing and treatment, and address a serious condition for which an 
effective intervention exists. Neither of these tests, alone or in combination, meets all of 
these criteria.
The strengths of the study include the large sample size, simultaneous measurement of both 
fetal fibronectin level and cervical length, and close attention to the accuracy of cervical 
length measurements and clinical outcomes. All transvaginal cervical length measurements 
were performed by centrally certified sonographers, reducing the potential for error due to 
inaccurate measurement of cervical length.
The study has several limitations, including use of self-collection of fibronectin swabs. 
Although the manufacturer’s instructions support self-collection, it may not be as reliable as 
collection during speculum examination. Enrollees were also not asked about symptoms at 
the time of collection. That women with cervix lengths less than 15 mm might have been 
treated with progesterone could have decreased the rate of subsequent premature birth, but 
the sensitivity analysis does not support this.
Although the study population reflected the demographic characteristics of the United States 
in general, the rate of spontaneous preterm birth before 37 weeks (5%) was less than 
expected (7.7%). This may have occurred because women who participate in research 
studies differ from the total population or because they have enhanced access to medical and 
social interventions that affect their outcomes. This difference requires further investigation.
Conclusions
Among nulliparous women with singleton pregnancies, quantitative vaginal fetal fibronectin 
and serial transvaginal ultrasound cervical length had low predictive accuracy for

 Key Points
Question
What is the accuracy of universal screening to predict spontaneous preterm birth before 
37 weeks in nulliparous women using transvaginal cervical length and quantitative self-
collected vaginal fetal fibronectin assessments?
Findings
In this observational study of 9410 nulliparous women with singleton pregnancies carried 
to 20 weeks or more, quantitative fetal fibronectin and transvaginal cervical length, alone 
and in combination, had poor predictive capabilities as screening tests for spontaneous 
preterm birth. Screening with transvaginal cervical length (threshold 25 mm or less) 
identified only a minority (23.3%) of cases of spontaneous preterm birth.
Meaning
Routine universal screening using transvaginal cervical length, quantitative fetal 
fibronectin, or both did not accurately predict subsequent spontaneous preterm birth and 
should not be used in routine clinical care in nulliparous women.

 Figure 1. Enrollment and Inclusion in Analysis in the Nulliparous Pregnancy Outcome Study: 
Monitoring Mothers-to-Be (nuMoM2b)
This analysis assessed serial transvaginal ultrasound cervical length and quantitative vaginal 
fetal fibronectin, alone and in combination, and measured at different points during 
pregnancy and as rates of change, to detect spontaneous preterm birth in nulliparous women 
with singleton pregnancies successfully carried 20 weeks or more. Women enrolled in the 
study who carried their pregnancy to 20 weeks or more were eligible for the analysis. To 
determine eligibility required collection of the necessary pregnancy outcome data to exclude 
pregnancy losses at less than 20 weeks. Furthermore, the analysis was only possible among 
the women with results from at least 1 serial transvaginal ultrasound or 1 sample assayed for 
fetal fibronectin level. TVCL indicates transvaginal cervical length.

 Figure 2. Receiver Operating Characteristic Curves for Visit-3 Measures Predicting Spontaneous 
Preterm Birth at Less Than 37 Weeks’ Gestation
Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves are shown for serial transvaginal ultrasound 
cervical length (TVCL), quantitative vaginal fetal fibronectin, and their combination through 
a logistic regression model in predicting spontaneous preterm birth at less than 37 weeks’ 
gestation. The ultrasound used for the cervical length measurement and the sample required 
for the fetal fibronectin assay were taken at Nulliparous Pregnancy Outcome Study: 
Monitoring Mothers-to-Be (nuMoM2b) visit 3, scheduled for 22 to 30 weeks’ gestation. The 
graph includes all women with the cervical length measurement for the cervical length 
curve; all women with fetal fibronectin data for the fetal fibronectin curve; and all women 
with both for the combined curve. Statistics below the graph correspond to the graph (all 
available data). Area under the ROC curve (AUC) statistics, restricted to the women with 
both measures (n = 8211), are 0.67 (95% CI, 0.64–0.71) for TVCL at visit 3; 0.58 (95% CI, 
0.55–0.62) for vaginal fetal fibronectin level at visit 3; and 0.67 (95% CI, 0.64–0.70) for 
both TVCL and fetal fibronectin level at visit 3. The AUCs are significantly different for 
TVCL vs fetal fibronectin level, P < .001. The AUC combining TVCL and fetal fibronectin 
level is not significantly different from that for TVCL alone (P = .54). Sensitivity plus 
specificity is maximized at 31.7 mm for TVCL and 7.08 ng/mL for fetal fibronectin.

aGestational age at the study visit was computed using the project-estimated date of delivery and the ultrasound date. Rate of change was restricted to ultrasounds at least 4 weeks apart.
bA cutoff of −0.85 for change in cervical length per week of gestation was the lower 25th percentile for all births.
cGestational age at the study visit was computed using the project-estimated date of delivery and the date of the fetal fibronectin collection, if valid; otherwise, the date of the visit interview was used.
dA cutoff of 0.15 for change in fetal fibronectin level from visit 1 to visit 2 per week gestation was the largest 25th percentile for all births. A cutoff of 0.17 for change in fetal fibronectin level from visit 2 
to visit 3 per week gestation was the largest 25th percentile for all births.
eP values shown are from Wilcoxon rank sum tests comparing distributions (selected percentiles are shown), and from χ2 tests comparing percentages.
