Abstract
Background
Stroke is a leading cause of death and disability; worldwide it is estimated that 16.9 million
people have a first stroke each year. Lipid-lowering, anticoagulant, and antihypertensive
drugs can prevent strokes, but may be underused.
Methods and Findings
We analysed anonymised electronic primary care records from a United Kingdom (UK) pri-
mary care database that covers approximately 6% of the UK population. Patients with first-
ever stroke/transient ischaemic attack (TIA), �18 y, with diagnosis between 1 January
2009 and 31 December 2013, were included. Drugs were considered under-prescribed
when lipid-lowering, anticoagulant, or antihypertensive drugs were clinically indicated but
were not prescribed prior to the time of stroke or TIA. The proportions of strokes or TIAs
with prevention drugs under-prescribed, when clinically indicated, were calculated.
In all, 29,043 stroke/TIA patients met the inclusion criteria; 17,680 had �1 prevention
drug clinically indicated: 16,028 had lipid-lowering drugs indicated, 3,194 anticoagulant
drugs, and 7,008 antihypertensive drugs. At least one prevention drug was not prescribed
when clinically indicated in 54% (9,579/17,680) of stroke/TIA patients: 49% (7,836/16,028)
were not prescribed lipid-lowering drugs, 52% (1,647/3,194) were not prescribed anticoag-
ulant drugs, and 25% (1,740/7,008) were not prescribed antihypertensive drugs.
The limitations of our study are that our definition of under-prescribing of drugs for
stroke/TIA prevention did not address patients’ adherence to medication or medication tar-
gets, such as blood pressure levels.
Conclusions
In our study, over half of people eligible for lipid-lowering, anticoagulant, or antihypertensive
drugs were not prescribed them prior to first stroke/TIA. We estimate that approximately

Author Summary
Why Was This Study Done?
• Atrial fibrillation, dyslipidaemia, and hypertension are risk factors for stroke and tran-
sient ischaemic attack (TIA). However, anticoagulant, lipid-lowering, and antihyper-
tensive drugs have been found to reduce the incidence of stroke.
• Prescribing of these drugs for primary stroke/TIA prevention may be suboptimal in
general practice. The proportion of stroke/TIA patients not prescribed prevention
drugs when anticoagulant, lipid-lowering, or antihypertensive drugs are clinically indi-
cated is unclear.
What Did the Researchers Do and Find?
• We conducted a retrospective analysis of the electronic primary care medical records
of 29,043 stroke/TIA patients in the UK.
• Half of the patients with clinical indications for anticoagulant drugs (52%; 1,647/3,194)
or lipid-lowering drugs (49%; 7,836/16,028) were not prescribed these drugs prior to
stroke/TIA. A quarter of the patients with clinical indications for antihypertensive
drugs (25%; 1,740/7,008) were not prescribed these drugs prior to stroke/TIA.
• There was no reduction in the proportion of stroke/TIA patients with prior missed
opportunities for prevention with lipid-lowering or antihypertensive drugs between
2009 and 2013; however, prescribing of anticoagulant drugs improved during this
period.
What Do These Findings Mean?
• Improving prescribing of anticoagulant, lipid-lowering, and antihypertensive drugs in
primary care could potentially prevent approximately 12,000 first strokes annually in
the United Kingdom.
Introduction
Stroke is a leading cause of death and disability worldwide, with an estimated annual incidence
of 16.9 million first strokes and 6 million stroke-related deaths [1]. Although the age-standard-
ised incidence rates have decreased over the past two decades, the absolute numbers of strokes

 and stroke-related deaths and disability cases have increased due to the ageing population [1].
Furthermore, transient ischaemic attack (TIA) is an important risk factor for stroke that also
has a high prevalence worldwide [2].
Primary prevention through treatment of modifiable risk factors [3–5] can reduce the global
burden of stroke and TIA. Dyslipidaemia, atrial fibrillation, and hypertension are important
modifiable risk factors for these conditions; lipid-lowering, anticoagulant, and antihypertensive
drugs, respectively, have been shown to be effective at reducing stroke incidence in patients
with these conditions [6–10]. Evidence-basedguidelines recommend lipid-lowering drugs for
people with existing cardiovascular disease (CVD) and those at high CVD risk [3]; anticoagu-
lant drugs are recommended for patients with atrial fibrillation at high stroke risk [5]; and anti-
hypertensive drugs are recommended for people with high blood pressure (blood
pressure � 160/100 mm Hg) and for people with moderately high blood pressure (blood
pressure � 140/90 mm Hg) who have existing CVD or are at high CVD risk [4].
Despite evidence-basedguidelines, prescribing of lipid-lowering, anticoagulant, and antihy-
pertensive drugs for primary stroke and TIA prevention may be suboptimal in primary care
[11–19]. Our objective was to determine, in a large primary care database covering approxi-
mately 6% of the United Kingdom (UK) population, the proportion of people eligible for pri-
mary prevention with lipid-lowering, anticoagulant, and antihypertensive drugs but not
prescribed these drugs prior to stroke or TIA.
Methods
The full protocol for this study has been published [20]; methods are summarised in brief
below. Analysis of The Health Improvement Network (THIN) database has ethical approval
from the National Health ServiceSouth-East Multicentre Research Ethics Committee, subject
to independent scientific review [21]. This study had approval by a scientific review committee
that is administered by IMS Health Real-World Evidence Solutions (reference: 13–023).
Study Design and Data Source
The study analysed routine electronic primary care medical records from the THIN database
[22]. This is a large database of anonymised UK electronic primary care records extracted from
general practices using Vision patient record software. Data within THIN are representative of
the UK population, and recording of stroke and TIA in THIN has been shown to have a high
positive predictive value [23]. Furthermore, Vision software is used to print prescriptions, and
these are automatically retained in patients’ electronic records; therefore, prescribing data are
comprehensive and accurate [24]. The database covers approximately 6% of the UK popula-
tion, including 3.6 million current patients and 8.8 million former or deceased patients [25].
Population
We defined primary stroke prevention as prevention of stroke in individuals with no prior his-
tory of stroke; therefore; the study population comprised patients with a diagnosis of first
stroke, first TIA, or stroke with previous TIA. Patients were included who had a stroke/TIA
diagnosis between 1 January 2009 and 31 December 2013 and were aged 18 y and over at the
time of their diagnosis. The date of first-ever stroke or TIA was taken as the index date. To
ensure data quality and that important patient outcomes were being recorded consistently, the
index dates had to occur at least 1 y after the practice began using Vision patient record soft-
ware and after the practice date of acceptable mortality recording [26]. Only patients registered
at a practice for at least 1 y were included, to allow sufficient time for risk factor data to be
recorded.

 Outcomes
Under-prescribing of prevention drugs was defined as people with clinical indications for lipid-
lowering, anticoagulant, or antihypertensive drugs not being prescribed these drugs prior to the
time of their stroke/TIA. The most recent risk factor data prior to patients’ stroke or TIA were
used to determine if stroke prevention drugs were clinically indicated. Under-prescribing of pre-
vention drugs was recorded when patients in whom a lipid-lowering or antihypertensive drug
was clinically indicated had no record of a prescription for up to 90 d before their stroke or TIA
(the usual maximum prescription length in the UK) and no clinical code to indicate that the
patient was on these drugs. If an anticoagulant drug was clinically indicated, under-prescribing
was defined as no prescription up to 120 d before the event (to allow for referral to an anticoagu-
lation clinic) and no clinical code to indicate that the patient was on anticoagulant drugs.
Clinical indications for lipid-lowering, anticoagulant, and antihypertensive drugs were
based on UK national guidelines used during the study period [4,27,28]. Lipid-lowering drugs
were clinically indicated if patients had coronary heart disease (CHD), chronic kidney disease
(CKD), peripheral arterial disease (PAD), TIA (in stroke patients with prior TIA), diabetes
mellitus and age over 40 y, familial hypercholesterolaemia, or a 10-y CVD risk of �20%
(Table 1). Familial hypercholesterolaemia was defined as having a clinical code for the diagno-
sis or total cholesterol � 9 mmol/l [14]. Ten-year CVD risk was estimated using the adjusted
Framingham CVD risk score, which, for consistency, was calculated 1 d prior to the index date.
Anticoagulant drugs were clinically indicated if patients had a diagnosis of atrial fibrillation
and were at high risk of stroke (CHADS2 score � 1) (Table 1). Similar to the Framingham
CVD risk score, CHADS2 scores were calculated 1 d prior to the index date. The 2006 atrial
fibrillation guidelines allow a prescription of aspirin in patients with a CHADS2 score of 1
[27]. However, during the study period, important studies were published that showed aspirin
to be ineffective for stroke prevention [7,29], and this recommendation was superseded in the
2014 guidelines [5]. Therefore, under-prescribing of anticoagulant drugs was based on adher-
ence to best evidence available rather than guideline adherence.

 Antihypertensive drugs were clinically indicated if patients had high blood pressure (�160/
100 mm Hg) or if patients had moderately high blood pressure (�140/90 mm Hg) and CHD,
CKD, PAD, TIA (in stroke patients with prior TIA), diabetes and age over 40 y, or a 10-y CVD
risk of �20% (Table 1). The guidelines refer to a “sustained” blood pressure �160/100 mm Hg
or �140/90 mm Hg; therefore, blood pressure was the mean of the three most recent systolic
and diastolic blood pressure recordings within 3 y prior to stroke/TIA. People without three
blood pressure recordings within 3 y were not included in this analysis. Patients with a clinical
code to indicate a diagnosis of hypertension but whose average blood pressure recordings were
lower than the thresholds given above were excluded from the analysis for antihypertensive
drugs; therefore, our analyses focused on uncontrolled hypertension.
Definitions of Variables
A comprehensive list of clinical codes (Read codes) [30] for stroke and TIA was used to identify
the study cohort. Patients with a clinical code indicating history of stroke or TIA recorded
before a clinical code for stroke or TIA were excluded as their true index date could not be
identified. Diagnoses of atrial fibrillation, diabetes, CVD, and other comorbidities were defined
by the standard list of clinical codes used to identify chronic diseases for the UK chronic disease
monitoring programme (Quality and Outcomes Framework [QOF] business rules version 27
[31]), and, where present, “history of”or “resolved” clinical codes were extracted. Drug pre-
scriptions corresponding to British National Formulary (version 67) chapters [32] for lipid-
lowering, anticoagulant, and antihypertensive drugs and clinical codes indicating that the
patient was on these drugs were extracted to identify treated patients. Clinical codes indicating
that prevention drugs were declined or contraindicated, that a patient had white coat hyperten-
sion (for patients in whom antihypertensive drugs were clinically indicated), or that there was
an adverse reaction were also extracted. Rurality (urban/rural)and Townsend deprivation
quintiles were extracted for each patient [33].
Quality Checks, Missing Data, and Extreme Values
Quality checks on THIN data are completed by the company that owns THIN, IMS Health,
before data are made available for researchers [34]. Clinically implausible values were excluded
for blood pressure, height, weight, body mass index, total cholesterol, and high-density lipopro-
tein cholesterol based on prespecified cutoff values (S1 Table). If no clinically plausible values
were recorded at any time prior to the index date, the variable was categorised as missing.
Absence of a clinical code for an individual diagnosis prior to the index date was taken to indi-
cate that the diagnosis was not present at the index date. Missing data for other variables were
categorised as missing. Data were initially extracted for diagnoses between 1 January 2000 and
31 December 2013; however, the number of incident stroke and TIA events recorded before
2008 was less than 15% of recorded stroke and TIA incidence after 2009 (S1 Fig). After 2009,
stroke and TIA incidence were more stable; therefore, only stroke and TIA diagnoses that
occurredfrom 1 January 2009 to 31 December 2013 were included.
Analysis
All analysis was conducted using STATA version 12 (StataCorp). Patients were categorised as
having a stroke, TIA, or stroke with previous TIA. The proportions of patients with lipid-low-
ering, anticoagulant, and antihypertensive drug therapy not prescribed when clinically indi-
cated were calculated for each diagnosis category, and the difference between groups tested
using Pearson’s chi-squared test. The proportions of patients with multiple drugs not pre-
scribed were calculated. In addition, of the patients under-prescribed stroke/TIA prevention

 drugs, the proportions of patients previously prescribed prevention drugs but whose prescrip-
tions had stopped were identified. Exploratory analyses (see S1 Appendix) excluded CVD risk
factors and variables used to calculate Framingham and CHADS2 scores that were recorded
within 1 wk prior to the index date. In addition, exploratory analysis investigated the effect of
using the CHA2DS2-VASc stroke risk score and QRISK2-2014 CVD risk equation, to reflect
the updated recommendations of the 2014 atrial fibrillation and lipid modification guidelines,
respectively [3,5]. Exploratory analyses examined the effect of changing the 10-y CVD risk
from 20% to 10%, which was also an updated recommendation from the lipid modification
guidelines [3]. To reflect the 2006 guideline recommendations for atrial fibrillation, exploratory
analysis investigated the use of aspirin for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation patients with a
CHADS2 score of 1 [27]. In exploratory analyses, we calculated crude estimates of under-pre-
scribing of prevention drugs and the potential number of strokes that could be prevented each
year in the UK. Detailed calculations are presented in S1 Appendix.
Results
During the study period, 29,043 people with stroke or TIA met the inclusion criteria (16,245
stroke only, 10,446 TIA only, and 2,352 stroke with previous TIA). The median age was 74 y
(interquartile range 64, 82), and 51% were female. At the time of their stroke or TIA, 17,680
patients (61%) had a clinical indication for one or more stroke prevention drugs: 9,953 had one
prevention drug indicated, 6,904 had two indicated, and 823 had three indicated. In all, 16,028
(55%) patients had a clinical indication for lipid-lowering drugs, 3,194 (11%), for anticoagulant
drugs, and 7,008 (24%), for antihypertensive drugs. Descriptive characteristics of patients with
clinical indications for each prevention drug are presented in Table 2. A clinical code indicating
that prevention drugs were declined or contraindicated, that a patient had white coat hyperten-
sion (for hypertensive patients), or that there was an adverse reaction was recorded in only 5%
(869/16,028) of patients with a clinical indication for lipid-lowering drugs, 7% (244/3,194), for
anticoagulant drugs, and 0.7% (47/7,008), for antihypertensive drugs (S2 Fig).
Under-prescribing of Drugs for Stroke/TIA Prevention
Fifty-four percent (9,579/17,680) of people with a clinical indication for one or more preven-
tion drugs prior to stroke or TIA were not prescribed these drugs; in the majority of these
cases, one drug was not prescribed (83%; 7,969/9,579), in 16% (1,576/9,579) two drugs were
not prescribed, and in 0.4% (34/9,579) three drugs were not prescribed (Table 3). The combi-
nations of multiple prevention drugs under-prescribed are presented in S2 Fig. Under-pre-
scribing of prevention drugs was found in 49% (7,836/16,028) of patients with a clinical
indication for lipid-lowering drugs, 52% (1,647/3,194), for anticoagulant drugs, and 25%
(1,740/7,008), for antihypertensive drugs (Table 4). There was no significant difference in the
proportion of people with antihypertensive drugs under-prescribed among patients with stroke
only, TIA only, or stroke with previous TIA (p = 0.21; odds ratio [OR] 0.91, 95% CI 0.81–1.02,
for stroke versus TIA; OR 1.04, 95% CI 0.89–1.23, for stroke versus stroke with previous TIA).
However, for the other two classes of prevention drugs, there was a significant difference
between patients with stroke only, TIA only, or stroke with previous TIA: lipid-lowering drug
prescribing, p < 0.01 (OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.77–0.89, for stroke versus TIA; OR 0.97, 95% CI
0.89–1.07, for stroke versus stroke with previous TIA), and anticoagulant drug prescribing,
p = 0.02 (OR 1.02, 95% CI 0.88–1.12, for stroke versus TIA; OR 0.73, 95% CI 0.58–0.92, for
stroke versus stroke with previous TIA) (Table 4). Exploratory analysis excluded CVD risk fac-
tors and variables used to calculate Framingham and CHADS2 scores that were recorded
within 1 wk prior to the index date. There was minimal difference in the proportion of under-

 Estimates of Under-prescribing of Prevention Drugs in the UK
Population
Extrapolating the proportions of underuse of prevention drugs within the THIN database to
estimates of the UK population and stroke incidence, we estimate that 41,405 first stroke
patients are eligible for but not prescribed lipid-lowering, anticoagulant, or antihypertensive
drugs annually. Based on the effectiveness of statins, anticoagulant, and antihypertensive
drugs, the number of strokes that could potentially be prevented each year in the UK by opti-
mal prescribing is estimated to be 11,823 (Table 5).
Discussion
In this study carried out in UK primary care, six out of ten patients who had a first stroke or
TIA were eligible for at least one prevention drug at the time of their stroke or TIA; over half of
these were not prescribed prevention drugs that were clinically indicated. In effect, one-third of
all strokes or TIAs occurredin patients who had prevention drugs clinically indicated but were
not prescribed them. This included half of patients who had lipid-lowering or anticoagulant
drugs clinically indicated and a quarter of patients who had antihypertensive drugs clinically
indicated. The under-prescribing of anticoagulants decreased between 2009 and 2013, but
there was no change for lipid-lowering and antihypertensive drugs. Over half of the patients

 not prescribed antihypertensive drugs when clinically indicated had previously been prescribed
these drugs, but their prescriptions had stopped, compared to only 14% for anticoagulant
drugs and 30% for lipid-lowering drugs. Our findings indicate underuse of lipid-lowering, anti-
coagulant, and antihypertensive drugs in UK primary care in patients for whom these drugs
are clinically indicated for prevention of stroke or TIA.
The strengths of this study are that the dataset is representative of UK general practice and
the data are recent. The prescribing data are accurate and comprehensively recorded [23], and
the sample size is very large. Stroke and the main comorbidities are likely to be accurately
recorded as they are clinically significant, diagnoses have been validated within THIN [22],
and, in the UK, general practitioners (GPs) are incentivised to keep a register of patients with
these conditions. However, restricting the definition of comorbidities to QOF clinical codes
may result in diagnoses being missed if they were recorded using alternative clinical codes.
This was an epidemiological,descriptive study; therefore, an important limitation is that the
reasons for non-prescribing are unclear. There may be legitimate reasons why patients were
not prescribed prevention drugs that were not available in our dataset, such as bleeding risk
when prescribing anticoagulant drugs or knowledge of a patient’s adherence to medication.
Clinical codes indicating that prevention drugs were declined or contraindicated or that there
was an adverse reaction were extracted. However, patients with these clinical codes recorded
were not excluded from the analysis because it is unclear if these were currently relevant or his-
toric codes; we note that the number of patients in our sample with these codes was small (5%,
7%, and 0.7% for lipid-lowering, anticoagulant, and antihypertensive drugs, respectively). Fur-
thermore, prevention of stroke/TIA is complex, and our definition of under-prescribing does
not address patients’ adherence to medication, appropriate prescribing of drug combinations,
or medication targets, such as blood pressure levels. We defined under-prescribing of anticoag-
ulant drugs as no prescription of these drugs to atrial fibrillation patients with a CHADS2
score of �1 prior to stroke or TIA. Under-prescribing of anticoagulants based on adherence to
the 2006 guidelines allowing prescription of aspirin in patients with a CHADS2 score of 1 [27]
were explored in a sensitivity analysis (see S1 Appendix). Exploratory analysis also investigated
the impact of updated guidelines regarding use of the CHA2DS2-VASc and QRISK2-2014 risk
scores to reflect guideline updates [3,5] (see S1 Appendix). Finally, the extrapolations of the
findings to the UK population to determine the extent of under-prescribing of prevention
drugs and the potential number of strokes that could be prevented in the UK are crude esti-
mates. These analyses are intended to highlight the scale and impact of under-prescribing of
stroke prevention drugs rather than to provide precise estimates.

Under-prescribing of Drugs for Primary Prevention of Stroke/TIA

 Using estimates of the UK population [35], stroke incidence [36], and the effectiveness of
statins, anticoagulants, and antihypertensive drugs [6–10], we determined the extent of under-
prescribing of primary stroke prevention drugs in the UK (see Table E in S1 Appendix). We
estimate that approximately 41,400 first stroke patients are eligible for but not prescribed lipid-
lowering, anticoagulant, or antihypertensive drugs annually. Based on the relative risk reduc-
tion of these drugs, approximately 12,000 strokes could potentially be prevented each year in
the UK by optimal prescribing of stroke prevention drugs (see Table F in S1 Appendix). These
estimates demonstrate the potential impact of improving prescription of primary stroke pre-
vention drugs in the UK. Given that stroke is the second leading cause of death and third lead-
ing cause of disability-adjusted life-years lost worldwide [37,38], improving primary stroke and
TIA prevention is important to reduce the incidence and burden of these conditions.
Of the three prevention drugs, lipid-lowering drugs were the most commonly clinically indi-
cated; over half of the people who had a stroke or TIA were eligible for these drugs. Statin
drugs account for the majority of lipid-lowering drugs prescribed [39], and prescribing has
increased over the past decade [40]; nevertheless, there is controversy regarding administration
of these drugs for primary stroke prevention. Fears about side effects [41], polypharmacy [41],
and the medicalisation of “healthy” patients [42] have been identified as barriers to GPs pre-
scribing statins. However, statins are effective at reducing the incidence of stroke [9], and
statin-induced side effects are likely to be less frequent than originally thought [43]. These
drugs are often more commonly associated with CHD prevention; however, our findings dem-
onstrate the potential impact of improving prescription of lipid-lowering drugs in the context
of stroke prevention. Importantly, under-prescribing of lipid-lowering drugs for primary
stroke prevention is likely to rise given the most recent guideline recommendations, which
increase the number of people eligible for these drugs (see S1 Appendix) [3]. Furthermore, in
the UK, QOF introduced an incentive for statin prescribing for primary CVD prevention as
recently as 2013, and only patients aged 35 to 74 y with a new diagnosis of hypertension and
CVD risk �20% are eligible [31].
The proportion of stroke/TIA patients with anticoagulant drugs under-prescribed decreased
in the relatively short time period of the study (58% in 2009 to 45% in 2013), but still remained
substantial. During this period, there were subtle changes in the UK incentives for anticoagu-
lant prescribing: from 2009 to 2011, QOF incentivised either anticoagulants or antiplatelet
agents for patients with atrial fibrillation (regardless of stroke risk); in 2011/2012, stroke risk
was introduced (anticoagulants/antiplatelet agents for people with atrial fibrillation and a
CHADS2 score of 1, anticoagulants for people with atrial fibrillation and CHADS2 score > 1)
[31]. Older age has been reported by clinicians as one of the main reasons for not prescribing
anticoagulants [44]. This is particularly relevant because atrial fibrillation is more prevalent in
the elderly, stroke risk in atrial fibrillation increases in the elderly (median age of patents with
anticoagulants indicated was 82 y), and the population is ageing [45,46]. Bleeding risk, falls
risk, and polypharmacy, particularly in those with a reduced life expectancy, are likely to be
reasons for reduced prescribing in the elderly [44]. However, the benefits of anticoagulation in
the elderly have been shown to outweigh the risks, and the net benefit of anticoagulation is
actually greatest in the elderly [29]. Under-prescribing of anticoagulants for atrial fibrillation
patients in particular has the potential to cause a huge burden on patients and society because
strokes in these patients are associated with greater post-stroke disability and mortality [47,48].
Hypertension is one of the most well documented risk factors for stroke, and there is a well-
established evidence base for the use of antihypertensive drugs for primary stroke prevention
[4]; therefore, it is unclear why prescribing remains suboptimal. Of the three prevention drugs,
the lowest proportion of under-prescribing was found for antihypertensive drugs. This could
be a result of the strong evidence base, the safety profile, and the low cost of these drugs [4].

 However, the absolute number of stroke or TIA patients with these drugs under-prescribedwas
higher than that for anticoagulant drugs (1,647 versus 1,740 patients for anticoagulant and anti-
hypertensive drugs, respectively). Hypertension is a common comorbidity and contributes to
over half of strokes globally [49]; therefore, under-prescribing of antihypertensive drugs affects a
large number of people and is likely to have significant implications for stroke incidence.
There may be legitimate reasons for not prescribing stroke prevention drugs to people with
clinical indications, and, arguably, some of the non-prescribing reported by our study may not
represent missed opportunities for prevention. However, as discussed,evidence suggests GPs
may overestimate side effects [43] and underestimate the benefit for elderly patients [29]. Mul-
tiple GP-related barriers to guideline adherence have been identified, including knowledge of
guidelines and lack of agreement or outcome expectancy[50]. Research suggests that GPs’ rec-
ommendations highly influence patients’ preferences, which reinforces the importance of
addressing GP-related barriers [51]. However, guideline adherence and prescribing behaviour
is complex, and the problem is not limited to GP-related behaviours. Other barriers include
patient factors, such as patient preference and understanding/perceptionof risk, and environ-
mental factors, such as time and resource constraints [50]. This complexity is highlighted by
our finding that there was a difference between the three prevention drugs in the proportion of
prescriptions stopped compared to those never prescribed in patients with drugs under-pre-
scribed.Therefore, it is important to understand the different behavioural mechanisms related
to non-prescribing for each drug and to consider this complex behavioural system for future
research and intervention development.
Under-prescribing of drugs for stroke prevention has been reported by other international
studies. A survey of 66 general practices from 12 European countries found similar rates of
under-prescribing (50%) of lipid-lowering drugs in people with hypercholesterolaemia; how-
ever, only 14% of people with elevated blood pressure were not prescribed blood-pressure-low-
ering medication [52]. Similarly, a cross-sectional study of 162 Italian GPs and 3,120 patients
found that treatment levels were high for people with hypertension (96%), but low for people
with hyperlipidaemia (46%) [19]. There is evidence to suggest that identification and treatment
of hypertension may be higher in the United States of America and Canada than in other coun-
tries [53]. However, it is difficult to compare the prescribing rates of these studies with those of
ours because different definitions of under-prescribing were used.A worldwide (30 countries)
observationalregistry of newly diagnosed atrial fibrillation patients found that anticoagulants
were prescribed in 61% of patients; however, there was overuse of these drugs in people at low
risk of stroke [54].
In conclusion, our findings quantify the underuse of lipid-lowering, anticoagulant, and anti-
hypertensive drugs for primary stroke and TIA prevention in UK primary care. Dyslipidaemia,
atrial fibrillation, and hypertension are three of the most important risk factors for stroke and
TIA; therefore, our finding that medical management of these conditions is inadequate has
important clinical and policy implications. Substantial numbers of strokes and TIAs could
potentially be prevented through improving prescription of these drugs in primary care, which
would contribute to reducing the burden of these conditions.
