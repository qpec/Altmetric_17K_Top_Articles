This study utilised an innovative application of spatial cluster analysis to examine the socio-spatial patterning of
outlets selling potentially health-damaging goods/services, such as alcohol, fast food, tobacco and gambling,
within Glasgow City, Scotland. For all categories of outlets combined, numbers of clusters increased linearly
from the least to the most income deprived areas (i.e. one cluster within the least deprived quintile to ten within
the most deprived quintile). Co-location of individual types of outlets (alcohol, fast food, tobacco and gambling)
within similar geographical areas was also evident. This type of research could influence interventions to tackle
the co-occurrence of unhealthy behaviours and contribute to policies tackling higher numbers of ‘environmental
bads’ within deprived areas.
1. Introduction
Health-related behaviours, such as smoking, heavy drinking and
poor diet, can lead to higher risk of chronic disease, multi-morbidity,
and shortened life span (Cawley and Ruhm, 2011; Fortin et al., 2014).
The drivers of such behaviours are multifactorial and recent work has
acknowledged that health behaviours are influenced, not just by
personal attributes, but also by features of the broader physical, social,
economic and cultural environments (Shortt et al., 2014). Most
recently there has been a focus on the retail environment specifically,
and the ways in which it may contribute to the health ‘chances’ afforded
to the population (Thomas and Frohlich, 2012). With a focus on
inequalities, research has begun to explore the relationship between
such environmental risk factors and area level deprivation.
Recent research has explored the distribution of each of these outlet
types in isolation: tobacco (Shortt et al., 2015; Chaiton et al., 2013),
alcohol (Hay et al., 2009; Ellaway et al., 2010), fast food (Fraser et al.,
2010; Macdonald et al., 2007), and gambling outlets (Robitaille and
Herjean, 2008; Wardle et al., 2014). It has been reported that an
increased availability of each is related to an increase in related
unhealthy behaviours; for smoking (Reitzel et al., 2011; Novak et al.,
2006; Shortt et al., 2016), increased alcohol consumption (and related
violence) (Connor et al., 2010; Livingston, 2008; Young et al., 2013),
increased consumption of fast food and increased obesity rates
(Bodicoat et al., 2015; Moore et al., 2009) and increased likelihood
of problem gambling (Pearce et al., 2008; Young et al., 2012). Whilst
the health consequences of smoking, excess alcohol consumption and
an unhealthy diet are well established, for gambling the association
with health is under-researched (Lancet Editorial, 2017). Problem
gambling has however been linked to several health outcomes, such as
increased alcohol consumption, obesity, smoking, mental health pro-
blems, and suicide (Barnes et al., 2015a; Black et al., 2013), as well as
intimate partner violence (Afifi et al., 2010). Although the majority of
work in this area has focussed on features of the environment in
isolation, unhealthy behaviours do interact (such as alcohol misuse and
smoking) (Buck and Frosini, 2012; Meader et al., 2016; Room, 2004)
and individuals do not experience one type of retail outlet in isolation
from the others.
Strong socioeconomic gradients in retailer presence exist within the
UK and further afield, and it has been suggested that the overprovision
of a range of health damaging outlets in deprived areas is a form of
‘environmental injustice’ (Mennis et al., 2016; Romley et al., 2007).
Within Scotland, compared to more affluent areas, deprived areas
showed greater densities of alcohol, tobacco and gambling outlets
(Shortt et al., 2015; Wardle et al., 2014); in Canada tobacco outlet and
gambling outlet densities were higher within deprived areas (Chaiton

 et al., 2013; Wilson et al., 2006); and deprived areas in New Zealand
and Australia showed higher densities of alcohol outlets and fast food
outlets respectively (Hay et al., 2009; Thornton et al., 2016). Such
gradients may contribute to the wider social gradient in health related
outcomes. This association is not always clear-cut and findings vary by
geographical region. For example, earlier Glasgow-based studies found
no clear socio-spatial patterning in the distribution of fast food or
alcohol outlets by deprivation (Ellaway et al., 2010; Macintyre et al.,
2008).
Limited work looks at the availability of a variety of categories. One
study explored the availability of three types of retailer, tobacco,
alcohol and takeaway outlets in four districts in Cologne, Germany
(Schneider and Gruber, 2012), while other research calculated the
density of alcohol and tobacco outlets in small neighbourhoods across
Scotland (Shortt et al., 2015); both studies compared access between
areas with varying levels of income deprivation. We go beyond previous
work by exploring four categories of outlets offering potentially harmful
products/services (both individually and in combined analysis), recog-
nising that people are exposed to multiple characteristics day-to-day.
We focus specifically on locating ‘clusters’ of outlets (i.e. occur closely
together) and explore whether these ‘co-locate’ (i.e. different categories
of outlet found in similar areas) within poorer neighbourhoods.
Previous research used a more traditional approach of comparing
densities across geographical areas (Chaiton et al., 2013; Ellaway et al.,
2010; Thornton et al., 2016; Wiggins et al., 2010; Shortt et al., 2016;
Hay et al., 2009; Wardle et al., 2014; Wilson et al., 2006). Within these
studies densities of outlets were generally calculated for pre-defined
geographical and administrative boundaries e.g. density of alcohol
outlets across Scottish ‘Data Zones’ (Ellaway et al., 2010), fast food
outlet density at Australian ‘Local Government Area’ (Thornton et al.,
2016), density of tobacco outlets at Canadian ‘Public Health Unit’ level
(Chaiton et al., 2013), or gambling outlet density within US ‘Census
Tracts’ (Wiggins et al., 2010). The benefit of this approach was the
potential to link these boundaries to additional key data such as
poverty rates (Ellaway et al., 2010; Thornton et al., 2016), indicators
of urbanicity/rurality (Thornton et al., 2016), population ethnicity
(Wiggins et al., 2010), or number of smokers (Chaiton et al., 2013). The
cluster analysis approach applied within our paper has previously been
used to detect geographic disparities in the incidence of disease cases,
e.g. cancer (Goungounga et al., 2016), tuberculosis (Roth et al., 2016)
and HIV (Zhang et al., 2017; Goungounga et al., 2016; Roth et al.,
2016) and to explore socio-economic distribution of road traffic
accident cluster locations following the construction of a new motorway
(Olsen et al., 2017). Spatial cluster analysis has rarely been used to
identify concentrations of retail outlets (Han and Gorman, 2014) but
lends itself well to this type of study for a number of reasons. Primarily,
it is a form of dynamic mapping which is not restricted by pre-defined
boundaries but locates natural concentrations of outlets. In doing so it
provides
objective,
robust
detection
of
potential
retail
clusters.
Furthermore, it enables the detection of small area levels of groups
of outlets containing higher than expected cases rather than applying a
smoothed density surface to a pre-defined geographical area such as a
census tract.
We examine the distribution of alcohol, tobacco, fast food and
gambling outlets within the geographical context of Glasgow because
the city contains areas of stark contrast, consisting of the most and
least deprived areas in Scotland with nearly half (48%) of neighbour-
hoods falling within the 20% most income deprived areas in Scotland
(The Scottish Government, 2016a). Glasgow displays an adverse health
profile in comparison to the rest of Scotland (Gray, 2008), and
compared to those residing within similar cities with similarly high
levels of socio-economic deprivation (Walsh et al., 2010). The current
study furthers our previous work on the socio-spatial patterning of
retail outlets and other amenities within Glasgow City and across
Scotland by using a novel application of cluster detection to advance
the field. Our earlier work looked at the density of food outlets and
alcohol outlets across pre-defined geographical boundaries (i.e. small
area level geography known as data zones), linking this geography to
deprivation scores and comparing more or less deprived areas within
Scotland (for fast food chains such as McDonald's (Cummins et al.,
2005) Burger King, KFC and Pizza Hut (Macdonald et al., 2007)), and
Glasgow (for various out of home food outlets (Macintyre et al., 2005),
food retailers (Macdonald et al., 2009), amenities (e.g. schools, leisure
centres, hospitals) (Macintyre et al., 2008), and alcohol outlets
((Ellaway et al., 2010), (Young et al., 2013)).
The main objectives of this research are to explore whether
particular areas are subject to excess access to potentially health
damaging retailers and whether these types of retailers co-locate within
these areas. We do this by examining the socio-spatial patterning of a
range of retail outlets which sell potentially health damaging products
(alcohol, tobacco, fast food) or services (gambling) in combination and
separately; utilising an innovative application of cluster analysis to
detect if geographic clusters of these outlets exist (i.e. outlets locate
closely together) and co-locate (i.e. different categories of outlet found
in similar areas) within poorer neighbourhoods.
2. Methods
2.1. Outlet data
Address data for all outlets were obtained from Glasgow City
Council (i.e. the local government body for the City of Glasgow), for
2012 (tobacco and fast food), and 2013 (alcohol and gambling).
Although we did not validate address information for every outlet,
due to the number of premises, the data held is deemed as compre-
hensive as information on the various premises is required to be held
by Glasgow City Council for inspection, planning and licensing
purposes (see Ellaway et al., 2010, 2012) (e.g. food premise/standards
inspection, planning permission for gambling outlets, alcohol premise
licensing, tobacco retailers register).
The types of outlets in the current analysis included: 1) alcohol
outlets (including off-sales (off licence stores, convenience stores, and
supermarkets) and on-sales (restaurants, cafes, public houses, hotels,
nightclubs, entertainment venues, social and sports clubs)); 2) fast food
outlets: fast food chains, premises selling fast food (e.g. Chinese food,
Indian food, burgers, kebabs, fish and chips, pizza etc.); 3) tobacco
outlets: convenience stores, newsagents, supermarkets, petrol stations,
off licence stores; and 4) gambling outlets: betting shops, lottery
vendor, bingo halls, casinos, gambling machines. The postal codes for
the outlets were linked to precise geo-coordinates via the Office for
National Statistics Postcode Directory (for August 2011) which con-
tains British National Grid coordinates for address-weighted unit
postcode centroids (Office For National Statistics, 2016). Data cleaning
included checking for duplicates and correcting postcodes which did
not map.
2.2. Analysis
2.2.1. Detection of outlet clusters
SaTScan™ is a well-established cluster analysis tool that allows for
a variety of spatiotemporal cluster analyses based on various prob-
ability models. The procedure can identify geographically defined
clustered areas of high risk, low risk, or both, for the occurrence of
retail outlets, within a defined geographical boundary, enabling each
individual cluster to be compared to the whole geographical area in
question (Kulldorff, 2010). The software constructs a large number of
different sized circular frames (from zero to an imposed upper limit,
specified below) with varying location and radii across the study area
and then makes a comparison of occurrence of outlets within each
frame and the occurrence outside the frame. The close location of
frames with apparently higher rates of outlets is used to identify the
location and size of a cluster, and its statistical significance is then

 determined (i.e. this method identifies regions that are significantly
different from neighbouring regions) (Duncan et al., 2016). The scan
window used for the analysis surrounded that of Glasgow City, the
boundary is supplied in Fig. 1, and we chose this rectangular boundary
as we have previously conducted sensitivity analysis of this window size
(Olsen et al., 2017).
For each circular frame the software tests the null hypothesis of
constant risk of outlets throughout the area with the alternative
hypothesis that there is an elevated risk within the circular radii
outside of it. For cluster detection, we used a continuous Poisson-based
model in SaTScan™ v.9.4.2 (Satscan, 2005) to detect spatial clusters of
georeferenced outlets; the assessment of a cluster was made using a
likelihood ratio test. The model uses a space-time permutation model
that is useful when only case or count data are available, as is the case
for our dataset (Sparks et al., 2012). We used a continuous Poisson-
based model due to the ability to measure the location of retailers as
random locations across the geographic boundary, other procedures
within SaTScan consider locations to be non-random or ‘yes/no’ in
terms of a point location containing an outcome or not; we only
included point data if they were of interest (i.e. an alcohol retailer). It
allowed us to test whether the locations of retailers in the study window
were randomly distributed spatially or whether there were clusters of
retailers. The benefit being the procedure tests the null hypothesis that
the retailers follow a homogenous spatial Poisson process with constant
intensity throughout the study area, the procedure uses a circular
scanning window as this model has not been implemented to use an
elliptic window (Satscan, 2005). We did not apply population weighting
to analysis as this allowed us to use a purely spatial detection of
retailers. We believe it is important these clusters are detected
regardless of whether there are a greater number of people residing
within that area, as this may equate to greater population level
exposure.
Analysis was performed for all four categories of outlets combined,
to examine co-location, and for alcohol, fast food, tobacco, and
gambling outlets individually. The software provided an output of the
centroid of each cluster, its size (radius) and its statistical significance.
Significant (p < 0.05) clusters detected in SaTScan™ were mapped
using ArcMap version 10.3 to display their centroids and sizes. We
applied a cluster limit of 500 Cartesian units (i.e. spatial units based on
the Cartesian coordinate system which specifies each point uniquely in
a plane by a pair of numerical coordinates) for the statistical analysis; it
is considered good practice that clusters are made as small as possible
to ensure that low risk neighbourhoods are not incorrectly included in a
larger high-risk area as it is possible to sustain statistical significance
over a large geographical area which can encompass low risk areas
(Penna et al., 2009). We chose the upper bound limit for cluster of 500
Cartesian units, which equalled a diameter limit of 1 km (kilometre)
and 0.5 km from the centroid of the cluster, which is a commonly used
measure of reasonable walking distance within physical activity
research (Laverty et al., 2015).
2.3. Linking clusters to income deprivation
We obtained a look-up table linking data zones (i.e. small-area
statistical geography containing between approximately 500 and 1000
residents (The Scottish Government, 2005)) to the Scottish Index of
Multiple Deprivation 2012 (SIMD) Income sub-domain score; the
income score is based on numbers of claimants for a range of welfare
benefits e.g., Income Support, Jobseekers Allowance, Tax Credits etc.
(The Scottish Government, 2012). We chose not to use the full SIMD as
it includes drive time to amenities within the ‘Access’ sub-domain;
associating access to the outlets included in this analysis with a
measure that included the Access domain would be tautological
(Dundas et al., 2007). Data zone Income scores were grouped into
quintiles (Q1: most deprived, Q5: least deprived). Maps of geographic
centroids of data zones and cluster boundaries were overlaid and where
a data zone centroid fell within a cluster boundary it was linked to that
cluster. Mean SIMD Income scores were calculated for data zones
within each cluster, allowing each cluster to be allocated an income
score/quintile.
3. Results
Within Glasgow there were 1718 alcohol outlets, 903 fast food
outlets, 870 tobacco outlets and 262 gambling outlets. Table 1 contains
the number of statistically significant retail outlet clusters; 28 clusters
for all outlets combined, 20 for alcohol outlets, 16 for fast food outlets,
15 for tobacco outlets and 5 for gambling outlets. Clusters are
distributed across a range of areas in terms of the most and least
deprived but skewed towards the most deprived areas with few in the
least deprived areas. For all outlets, alcohol, fast food, tobacco and
gambling outlets the most deprived areas of Glasgow contain the
largest number of clusters. See Supplementary Table 1 for the full
output containing test statistics for each cluster by SIMD quintile, i.e.
mean observed and expected counts, log likelihood ratio (provides
evidence of the elevated risk of a retail outlet in that area) and p-values.
Fig. 2 shows the location of outlets and clusters for each of the
outlet categories. Fig. 3 shows the distribution of outlet clusters for all
outlet types by socio-economic status (SIMD Income quintiles; clusters
in most deprived areas in black, least deprived in light grey). The maps
show that although there is variation in the location of the various
categories there is evidence of co-location of clusters in similar
geographical areas; generally the clusters are located in the central
business district (i.e. the city centre), other retail, office and service
hubs in the ‘west end’ and ‘south side’ (i.e. south of the River Clyde),
and also areas in the ‘east end’. Fig. 3 shows clusters of varying radii; a

larger frame or a large number of frames in close proximity. A number
of the cluster radii cover areas displaying a range of deprivation scores;
however some radii within the east end of the city include mostly
deprived areas only.
4. Discussion
The aim of this study was to use a novel application of spatial
cluster analysis to explore the socio-spatial patterning of retail clusters
in Glasgow, Scotland. We believe that the form of dynamic mapping
used here, where spatial analysis is not restricted by pre-defined
boundaries but locates natural concentrations of outlets, advances
existing methods for quantifying spatial access to retail outlets. Our
findings indicate a greater number of outlet clusters located within
more deprived areas; all outlets (combined), alcohol outlets, fast food
outlets, and tobacco outlets were clustered within the most deprived
areas, while only slightly more clusters of gambling outlets were located
within the most deprived areas.
These findings highlight the need to go beyond focusing on clusters
of individual categories of outlets, as in existing research, to explore not
only clusters of a range of different categories of outlets but also co-
location of such clusters within similar areas (as seen in Figs. 2 and 3).
This type of research has the potential to benefit the study of the
mechanisms that drive health behaviours deemed ‘complementary’ (i.e.
often occur together) such as alcohol and tobacco use (Room, 2004)
and implications for interventions to tackle both. Indeed an interven-
tion to reduce smoking within Scotland by prohibiting tobacco use in
pubs and bars also led to reduction in alcohol consumption in
moderate/heavy drinking smokers (Mckee et al., 2009). To reduce
the impact of alcohol and tobacco availability in society it is important
to understand the mechanisms that drive the use of both, in isolation
and in combination. This could extend to other health behaviours that
may co-occur such as drinking and problem gambling (Welte et al.,
2004). Living in an environment with more availability of either
product, or a combination of both, may increase their use and under-
mine attempts to reduce either or both behaviours. Examining the
availability of related products may provide us with an improved
understanding of the role of the retail environment in multiple health
behaviours.

 4.1. Do outlets selling unhealthy products cluster in deprived areas?
For all categories of outlets, the numbers of clusters increased
linearly from least to most deprived quintiles with one cluster located
in Q5 (least deprived) compared to ten within Q1 (most deprived).
There appear to be areas which show concentrations of a number of
different types of outlets selling unhealthy services, suggesting co-
location. Loomis et al. remarked upon the tendency for poorer areas to
not only have greater access to tobacco outlets, but also to other
potentially health damaging services such as alcohol and fast food
outlets (Loomis et al., 2013), however their research did not explore
whether various categories of outlet co-located within deprived neigh-
bourhoods. Previous research in Scotland (Shortt et al., 2015) found
that outlets selling tobacco and off-sales were co-located in deprived
areas, with these areas exhibiting the highest densities of both.
Similarly, a study based in Cologne, Germany, found that clusters of
alcohol, fast food, and tobacco were more likely located within low
income areas thus creating potentially “addictive environments”
through a ‘culmination’ of health damaging exposures for residents
(Schneider and Gruber, 2012).
4.2. Do individual types of outlets co-locate in deprived areas?
There was evidence of co-location of the individual types within
similar geographical areas (see Figs. 2 and 3); many of the different
categories of clusters were located within the same areas i.e. around
busy main roads, and major shopping thoroughfares, with some
clusters based in areas of particularly high deprivation within the east
end of the city. This co-location of outlets may reflect shopper
convenience (i.e. everything they need in one area), or another theory
is that retailers purposefully choose areas close to populations with
greater demand for specific goods such as alcohol, fast food, tobacco
etc. but also choose the areas where retail rent is lower i.e. disadvan-
taged areas. Evidence for this was found for the siting of alcohol outlets
within Melbourne, Australia (Morrison et al., 2015). However from our
study we cannot ascertain why outlets were co-located within deprived
areas.
Alcohol outlets were found to cluster in the most deprived areas.
The results from our Glasgow-based research suggest a similar pattern
compared to studies undertaken within Australia (Livingston, 2012),
New Zealand (Hay et al., 2009), and the US (Gorman and Speer, 1997)
which show a higher concentration of alcohol outlets in deprived areas.
Previous research within Glasgow indicated that alcohol outlets were
not necessarily located within deprived areas, (Ellaway et al., 2010),
however this research used a different measure of geographical analysis
(i.e. density analysis) and did not use a more complex measure to locate
clusters of outlets as seen in this current work. A previous study which
did make use of the spatial scan technique to explore geographic
clustering of alcohol outlets in Lubbock, Texas found on-sales to be
clustered within a particularly deprived area while off-sales were
dispersed across Lubbock and located along major highways and roads
which the authors believed reflected the large numbers of drivers
within Texas (Han and Gorman, 2014). Han and Gorman (2014)
emphasised the importance of considering local context when studying
spatial access to alcohol; indeed for Glasgow the presence of clusters of
alcohol outlets in the east end could be related to its history of industry,
‘working class’ life, and to this day high deprivation.
The most deprived areas of Glasgow contained a greater number of
fast food clusters and tobacco outlet clusters, compared to the least
deprived areas. This corresponds to previous fast food outlet research
across Scotland and Glasgow City (Shortt et al., 2015), Canada
(Chaiton et al., 2013), the US (Loomis et al., 2013; Yu et al., 2010),
Australia (Wood et al., 2013) and New Zealand (Marsh et al., 2013),
and to tobacco outlet work within England and Scotland (Macdonald
et al., 2007), the US (Reidpath et al., 2002), Australia (Thornton et al.,
2016) and New Zealand (Pearce et al., 2007). Gambling outlets were
the least prolific of the retail categories studied and showed the lowest
number of clusters (n = 5), although the most deprived quintile
displayed the greatest number (n = 2) and the least deprived areas
had none. Similarly, existing studies of the distribution of gambling
machines observed positive associations with area income deprivation
across the UK (Wardle et al., 2014), and Canada (Wilson et al., 2006).
It could be argued that the physical presence of a gambling outlet may
be less important to health behaviours due to the proliferation of on-
line gambling, nonetheless existing research found that an increased
availability of gambling outlets was related to crime, anti-social
behaviour and other environmental incivilities (Bradford, 2011) and
an increased likelihood of problem gambling (Pearce et al., 2008;
Young et al., 2012). One particular US study found that those living
within three minutes of a lottery outlet where twice as likely to suffer
from problem gambling, and three times as likely to gamble frequently,
than those living greater than ten minutes away (Welte et al., 2006).
4.3. Policy/licensing implications
Our findings provide some support for constraints on alcohol, fast
food, tobacco and gambling outlets location in areas subject to over-
provision such as low income neighbourhoods. In terms of licensing of
alcohol outlets there are numerous controls put in place by local
authorities which aim to deal with crime, disorder and public nuisance,
public health, public safety, child safety etc. (City Of Glasgow Licensing
Board, 2016). However, various clusters do exist within Glasgow City
(n = 18), and with the established association between high concentra-
tions of alcohol outlets and increased risk of anti-social behaviour, such
as alcohol-related assaultive violence (Grubesic and Pridemore, 2011;
Livingston, 2008), there is a need for on-going assessment of policies/
restrictions on alcohol outlet access.
Restrictions on fast food access are near invisible in UK policy
(Foresight, 2007) with no guidance at a national level, and in a similar
vein, within Scotland there is no legislation on tobacco retail density
and no official licensing scheme. Retailers must sign the Tobacco
Retailers Register (The Scottish Government, 2017) but need not pay a
fee or meet specific requirements. Although the Scottish Government
created a number of new laws to tighten the sale of tobacco (The
Scottish Government, 2016c) there are no specific restrictions on
clustering or overprovision of tobacco outlets within a neighbourhood.
There is potential for local authorities to develop their own regulations
to enhance health promoting influences within local areas, as seen in
London borough Tower Hamlets with additional restrictions put on fast
food availability (Caraher et al., 2013). Policy measures to reduce
concentrations of fast food and tobacco outlets in areas which are
subject to overprovision could include restrictions on new outlets being
opened until a specified target is met, imposing minimum distance
requirements between outlets, maintaining low proportions of outlets
(e.g. less than five percent of all retail units as fast food/tobacco
retailer), no outlets within specified boundaries of schools, and
restrictions on opening hours (Ackerman et al., 2017; Caraher et al.,
2013; Cohen and Anglin, 2009).
The overprovision of gambling outlets is a key policy concern; for
example, as of February 2017, in Scotland planning permission must
be achieved by those seeking to open (or change an existing unit) to a
new gambling outlet (The Scottish Government, 2016b). Although
individual local authorities, such as Glasgow City Council, recognise
that issues such as loss of retail function and vacancy, and limited mix
of retail use in town centres must be addressed to limit the appearance
of gambling outlets (Lopez et al., 2016), there appear to be no specific
restrictions on tackling existing clusters of outlets. A proposal to limit
harm from existing outlets may include restrictions on fixed odds
betting terminals (FOBT) which can be a particularly damaging form of
gambling. Restrictions could be introduced on stakes, speed of play and
device numbers in betting outlets (Hanrahan, 2013); more recently the
UK government acknowledged that they are consulting on FOBT

 maximum bets being reduced from £100 to between £2 and £50 (UK
Government, 2017).
For policy related to distributions of alcohol, fast food, tobacco and
gambling outlets beyond Scotland and internationally, restrictions vary
considerably (Freeman, 2014; Gainsbury et al., 2014; Hodge et al.,
2008; Howard et al., 2014; Luke et al., 2016; Rehn, 2004) however
oversupply of these products/services appears to be a common theme
within deprived areas in the US, Canada, Australia etc. (Chaiton et al.,
2013; Hay et al., 2009; Thornton et al., 2016; Wilson et al., 2006);
much discussion over context specific legislation is necessary. The need
for an alternative to the placement of ‘environmental bads’ within
deprived areas is great. These neighbourhoods could benefit from the
‘smart growth’ approach where experts in planning, building, trans-
portation and public health work to improve residents’ quality of life,
and promote healthy behaviours, through policies which encourage for
example mixed land and building use and a more diverse set of retail
resources (United States Environmental Protection Agency, 2017).
4.4. Strengths
This study displayed a number of strengths; we used a novel
application of a method to explore socio-spatial distribution of retail
outlets which provided objective, robust detection of outlet clusters and
accompanying statistical data. Limited research made used of a spatial
scan statistic to locate clusters of alcohol outlets in Texas (Han and
Gorman, 2014). Prior research has often been restricted by calculating
and comparing densities within existing administrative boundaries
(Chaiton et al., 2013; James et al., 2017; Livingston, 2012; Loomis
et al., 2013; Wilson et al., 2006); this can be problematic due to the
‘modifiable areal unit problem’, i.e. when arbitrarily classified units
such as postal/zip codes or census tracts are used to report spatial
patterning resulting in potential statistical bias (Openshaw, 1984). The
method used here is less restricted by pre-defined boundaries as it
locates clusters of outlets across the whole city. Furthermore, while
previous work explored one or two categories in isolation our study
included a number of categories of health damaging outlets, allowing
for the location of areas with greater access to a number of unhealthy
products and services and contributes to the literature on determinants
of the co-occurrence of unhealthy behaviours (Meader et al., 2016).
4.5. Limitations
Due to the large numbers of outlets contained within the database
we did not validate every outlet. Although we cannot assume that all
data within the database is accurate we have no specific reason to
believe that bias has occurred due to missing/incorrect outlet data
being more or less likely in areas of a particular level of deprivation.
Nonetheless future work which involved a level of in-situ validation
would provide added benefit. A study based in Minnesota, US created a
modified ‘ground-truthing’ technique (i.e. checking accuracy using on
the ground observation) by exploring patterns of error in outlet data
and a focus on validation of central commercial clusters specifically;
findings showed that this technique provided a high level of accuracy at
a lower cost than traditional ground-truthing (Caspi and Friebur,
2016). Our study explored the availability of unhealthy resources but
did not provide comparative analysis exploring access to health
beneficial resources such as fruit and vegetable retailers, or super-
markets (Lamichhane et al., 2013). We cannot say whether the areas
with higher densities of tobacco, alcohol, gambling and fast food outlets
are compensated by better access to ‘healthy’ resources, although
previous Scotland based work did not find fruit and vegetable shops,
supermarkets (Macdonald et al., 2009) or sports facilities (Lamb et al.,
2010) to be more accessible in deprived areas. The creation of ‘retail
environment indices’ which include ratios of healthy resources to
unhealthy resources (Cobb et al., 2015), may be useful in future
research but beyond the capacity of the current study. This research
identifies the locations of clusters of outlets but we cannot say whether
higher numbers of clusters within deprived areas reflects greater
population numbers (i.e. greater demand); nonetheless greater avail-
ability of ‘harmful’ products/services within more disadvantaged areas
is in itself a matter of great concern. We did not apply population
weighting to the cluster detection of outlets and this could be
considered a limitation of the study, however detecting clusters of
‘environmental bads’ are important regardless of whether there is a
lesser or greater residential population, particularly as this is complex
when considering city centre non-residential areas. Indeed a higher
population living in close proximity to outlet clusters may equate to a
higher level of population exposure. Our study looks only at spatial
access but does not explore whether those living in neighbourhoods
with clusters of outlets are more likely to use local retailers as proximity
does not necessarily equate to use. However previous US based work
maintained that geographic presence of food outlets was correlated to
individuals’ awareness of their presence (Barnes et al., 2015b) which
could influence use of nearby outlets. We acknowledge that people
could access gambling services on-line, could order fast food to be
delivered to their homes from outlets out with their neighbourhood,
and may have access to illegal sources of tobacco and alcohol (Stead
et al., 2001); we do not include these sources in our study as reliable
data are not readily available; nor is data on the different sizes of
outlets or range of products sold. Finally, one limitation of the
SaTScan™ software is that it may not identify clusters which are
located on, or very close to, study area boundaries. However, by
including a large boundary surrounding the Glasgow City boundary,
we have avoided potential edge effects. Our previous study used UK
wide data and conducted a sensitivity analysis of Glasgow boundaries,
finding the results were not sensitive to boundary definition (Olsen
et al., 2017).
5. Conclusion
We observed a greater number of clusters of ‘environmental bad’
outlets (alcohol, fast food, tobacco, and gambling outlets combined)
located within more deprived areas. Additionally when analysed
individually alcohol outlets, tobacco outlets, fast food outlets and
gambling outlets were clustered within deprived areas. Furthermore,
we found a greater number of overlapping clusters in more deprived
neighbourhoods showing evidence of co-location. This research makes
use of a robust technique and novel application of cluster analysis to
detect clusters of outlets and adds to existing evidence that deprived
areas have increased opportunities to access potentially health dama-
ging and/or addictive goods or services. The findings reported here
may aid authorities to develop policies and planning regulations
appropriate for the areas in greatest need.
