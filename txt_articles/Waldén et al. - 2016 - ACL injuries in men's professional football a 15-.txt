ABSTRACT
Background Studies investigating the development of
ACL injuries over time in football are scarce and more
data on what happens before and after return to play
(RTP) are needed.
Aim To investigate (1) time trends in ACL injury rates,
(2) complication rates before return to match play
following ACL reconstruction, and (3) the influence of
ACL injury on the subsequent playing career in male
professional football players.
Methods 78 clubs were followed between 2001 and
2015. Time trend in ACL injury rate was analysed using
linear regression. ACL-injured players were monitored
until RTP and tracked for 3 years after RTP.
Results We recorded 157 ACL injuries, 140 total and
17 partial ruptures, with a non-significant average
annual increase in the ACL injury rate by 6% (R2=0.13,
b=0.059, 95% CI −0.04 to 0.15, p=0.20). The match
ACL injury rate was 20-fold higher than the training
injury rate (0.340 vs 0.017 per 1000 h). 138 players
(98.6%) with a total rupture underwent ACL
reconstruction; all 134 players with RTP data (4 players
still under rehabilitation) were able to return to training,
but 9 of them (6.7%) suffered complications before
their first match appearance (5 reruptures and 4 other
knee surgeries). The median layoff after ACL
reconstruction was 6.6 months to training and
7.4 months to match play. We report 3-year follow-up
data for 106 players in total; 91 players (85.8%)
were still playing football and 60 of 93 players (65%)
with ACL reconstruction for a total rupture played at the
same level.
Conclusions The ACL injury rate has not declined
during the 2000s and the rerupture rate before return
to match play was 4%. The RTP rate within a year after
ACL reconstruction was very high, but only two-thirds
competed at the highest level 3 years later.
INTRODUCTION
ACL rupture is a troublesome injury for a footballer
and the long-term consequences such as early-onset
osteoarthritis
are well
known.1
Interestingly,
a
recent study reported an increase in the number of
annual ACL injuries recorded in Major League
Soccer (MLS) from 1996 to 2012,2 although
playing exposure was not taken into consideration.
The rate of ligament injuries in general, including
medial collateral ligament (MCL) injuries of the
knee and ankle sprains, has declined substantially
in European professional football during the past
decade,3–5 but the development of ACL injury
is not known.
There are several studies investigating return to
play (RTP) after ACL injury or ACL reconstruc-
tion,2 6–9 including case reports of successful early
returns after ACL reconstruction and non-surgical
management.10 11 Even if a majority of players can
return to football after ACL injury/reconstruction,
some sustain further knee problems and need
further surgery.6 12 From a medical perspective, a
subsequent knee injury or the need for further
knee surgery occurring in the final phase of the
rehabilitation period or early after RTP could be
regarded as a treatment failure. The extent of this
problem is, however, essentially unclear from the
current literature. In addition, although we have
previously
shown
that
the
vast
majority
of
ACL-reconstructed male professional players can
return to the pitch within a year after surgery,8 the
longer term participation rate is unknown.
W
e therefore conducted this study on men’s pro-
fessional football over 14 seasons with the goal of
reporting (1) time trends in ACL injury rates, (2)
complication rates before return to match play fol-
lowing ACL reconstruction, and (3) the influence
of ACL injury on the subsequent playing career.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
This is a substudy of a long-term prospective
cohort study evaluating men’s professional football
in Europe since 2001.13 14 A total of 78 clubs with
4443 individual players from the highest national
leagues in 16 countries were followed over a
varying number of seasons from January 2001 to
May 2015 (365 club-seasons and 10 157 player-
seasons included for analysis). The general method-
ology for the injury surveillance has been reported
in detail elsewhere.15
Sample
All players belonging to the first team squads each
season were eligible for inclusion.16 Players who
were transferred to other clubs or finished their
contracts due to other reasons before the end of a
season were included in the general injury and
playing-exposure registration for as long as they
played for the club.
Definitions
Injury was defined according to the time-loss
concept.15 ACL injury was defined as a first-time or
recurrent partial or total rupture of the ligament

 occurring either isolated or associated with other concomitant
injuries to the knee joint.8 RTP was defined as the number of
days from injury or reconstruction to full training with the team
without restrictions (return to training) and to the first match
appearance with the first team, reserve team, under-21 team or
a national team (return to match play). Return to the same level
of play was defined as return to the highest national league
level, irrespective of country, and to lower level of play as all
levels below the highest national league. The injury was
classified as career ending if the player did not return to
football at all.
Data collection
A member of the club medical or coaching staff registered indi-
vidual playing-exposure in minutes during all club and national
team training sessions and matches. Injury cards and attendance
records were sent to the study group controller once a month.
For each ACL injury reported, a standard ACL injury report
form was emailed to the club medical staff requesting details on,
for example, any previous ACL injury, MRI findings and surgical
data.
All ACL-injured players were followed until RTP or the deci-
sion to end the playing career. RTP dates were taken automatic-
ally from the attendance record if the player was still in the
study or via the medical staff if the club or the player was no
longer in the study at the time of RTP
. Players were followed
closely
to
monitor
any
reruptures
or
surgeries
of
the
ACL-injured knee during the rehabilitation period and after
return to training in order to identify any possible reasons for
prolonging the time to full RTP
.
To evaluate the influence of the ACL injury on the short-term
playing career, players’ club track records were followed for
3 years after RTP even if they left the club or study during this
period. The 3-year follow-up track records were identified
through the clubs’ official websites and, if further information
was needed, via http://www.transfermarkt.co.uk. To be included
in this 3-year analysis, a player had to return to football at the
latest on 30 November 2012.
Statistical analyses
Data were
analysed using
SPSS (IBM
SPSS
Statistics
for
Windows, V
.22.0, IBM Corp, Armonk, New York, USA). Injury
rate was calculated as the number of injuries per 1000 h with
corresponding 95% CI. Injury rates were compared using a rate
ratio
(RR)
with
95%
CI
and
significance
tested
with
z-statistics.17 Time trend for ACL injury rate, expressed as the
average annual percentage of change, was analysed using a
linear regression model with log-transformed injury rates as the
dependent variable.3 In addition, a 2-year moving average (MA)
approach, by summarising two consecutive seasons, was also
used as a sensitivity analysis to smooth out any large seasonal
variations.3
The RTP rate was calculated as the percentage of ACL-injured
or ACL-reconstructed players who returned to football training
and match play.8 The complication rate was calculated as the
percentage of ACL-reconstructed players who suffered further
knee injury or underwent further knee surgery during the
rehabilitation period and after return to training. ACL-injured
or ACL-reconstructed players were tracked for 3 years after RTP
in order to calculate the percentage of players who were still
competing at the highest national level. Layoff times were pre-
sented as median values with a corresponding IQR. For players
with more than one ACL injury (graft rerupture or contralateral
ligament rupture) recorded in the injury surveillance, only the
first ACL injury was used in the 3-year follow-up. Average age
was reported as the mean with corresponding SD and group dif-
ferences tested with an unpaired Student’s t test. All analyses
were two sided and the significance level was set at p<0.05.
RESULTS
A total of 157 ACL injuries in 149 players, including six rerup-
tures and two contralateral ruptures, were recorded during the
study period (2 026 211 training hours and 361 702 match
hours) giving an overall ACL injury rate of 0.066 per 1000 h
(table 1). The total rupture rate was significantly higher than the
partial rupture rate (0.059 vs 0.007 per 1000 h; RR 8.2, 95% CI
5.0 to 13.6, p<0.001). The match ACL injury rate was 20 times
higher than the training injury rate (0.340 vs 0.017 per 1000 h;
RR 20.4, 95% CI 13.9 to 29.6, p<0.001). Mean (SD) age for
the 140 players with total rupture was 24.7 (4.5) years, and for
the 17 players with partial rupture it was 26.6 (4.5) years.
Time-trend analyses
The number of ACL injuries recorded per season varied
between 1 and 19 for match injuries and between 0 and 7 for
training injuries. The trend in the linear regression model indi-
cated an average annual increase of 6.0% for the ACL injury
rate, but was not significant (R2=0.13, b=0.059, 95% CI
−0.04 to 0.15, p=0.20). The 2-year MA approach indicated a
higher average annual increase, 23.1%, than the regression
model (figure 1). Similarly, the trend in the regression model
indicated a non-significant average annual increase of 6.0% for
the ACL match injury rate (R2=0.15, b=0.056, 95% CI −0.03
to 0.01, p=0.17), whereas the 2-year MA approach indicated
16.7% (figure 2). Seasonal trend was not possible to analyse for
training owing to four seasons with no training-related ACL
injuries.
Total ACL ruptures
The majority of the total ruptures underwent ACL reconstruc-
tion (138/140, 98.6%); one player ended his career directly
after the event and another returned to training after 92 days
and to match play after 105 days without surgery.
RTP rates
Four total ruptures from the closing period of the 2014/2015
season were still under rehabilitation and not yet cleared for
RTP
. All other players returned to training, which means a
remarkable 130 of 134 players (97.0%) returned to the same
playing level.
Five players returned to full team training, but never partici-
pated in match play (table 1); two players ended their careers
and three players suffered reruptures. A majority of players were
cleared
for
RTP within
a year after
ACL
reconstruction
(figure 3), with only five (3.7%) and eight (9.7%) players
returning to training and match play later than 1 year. The
median layoff times after ACL reconstruction were 201.5 (IQR
58.0) days (6.6 months) to training and 225.0 (IQR 80.3) days
(7.4 months) to match play. Excluding players with career-
ending injuries (N=2), reruptures (N=3) and players still under
rehabilitation (N=4), players’ first match appearance after RTP
was with the first team in 79 cases (35 friendly matches), with
the under-21 or reserve team in 49 cases (all league matches)
and with a national team in one case (friendly match).
Complication rates before return to match play
In total, nine players (6.7%) with ACL reconstruction (excluding
the 4 players still under rehabilitation) suffered further knee

 injury or underwent further knee surgery before their first
match appearance. T
wo players reruptured their grafts during
the rehabilitation and three players reruptured their grafts after
return to training, but before they participated in match play.
T
wo players had other ipsilateral knee surgery during their
rehabilitation (arthroscopic clearing out procedures owing to
repeated effusions) and another two players had ipsilateral
surgery after return to training (arthroscopic cartilage debride-
ment and arthroscopic meniscus repair). In addition, one player
suffered a rectus femoris strain early after return to training,
prolonging his time to return to match play after his ACL
reconstruction.
The influence of total ACL injury on the playing career
There were 3-year follow-up data available for 93 players (8
repeat ruptures and 39 players injured later than November
2012 excluded from analysis). Eighty-one players (87.1%) were
still playing football 3 years after RTP
, 60 (64.5%) at the same
level and 21 (22.6%) at a lower level, and 12 players had ended
their careers. The mean (SD) ages for those who played at the
same level 3 years after RTP and those who were not, 24.5 (4.0)
vs 25.3 (6.0) years, did not differ significantly (p=0.46).
Partial ACL ruptures
T
wo injuries involved the posterolateral (PL) bundle and under-
went a PL bundle reconstruction with a semitendinosus tendon.
The remaining 15 partial ruptures were all treated without ACL
reconstruction, but two of these players had other ipsilateral
knee surgery owing to concomitant injuries: the first player had
meniscus surgery, and the second player had microfracture
surgery.
RTP rates
One player with a partial rupture ended his career after this
injury event owing to a history of ACL reconstruction twice in
the contralateral knee. All other players returned to training (15
of 16 to the same playing level), but one player not to match
play (table 1). Excluding the career-ending injury and the four
with knee surgery, the median layoff times were 59.5 (IQR
50.5) days (2.0 months) to training and 75.0 (IQR 83.8) days
(2.5 months) to match play.
Complication rates before return to match play
One injury was classified as a partial rerupture and was treated
non-surgically. After only 10 days of football training, there was
a new trauma resulting in a total graft rupture. No other compli-
cations for the partial ruptures were identified.
The influence of partial ACL injury on the playing career
There were 3-year follow-up data available for 13 players (4
players injured later than November 2012). T
en players were
still playing football 3 years after RTP
, eight at the same level
and two at a lower level, whereas three players had ended their
careers.
DISCUSSION
The main finding of this study was that the ACL injury rate in
male professional football players did not decline during the

ACL injury epidemiology
The overall ACL injury rate in the current study was 0.066 per
1000 h or 0.43 per team per season, which extends the similar
rate reported for this cohort up to the 2008/2009 season.8 Only
a few studies have investigated the development of injury rates
over time in professional sports and previous studies from our
group have shown conflicting trends; ligament injuries such as
ankle sprain and MCL injury of the knee show decreasing
trends,4 5 whereas hamstring injury seems to increase.16 For
ACL injury, one study on male professional players in the USA
reported an increase in the number of annual ACL injuries from
1996 to 2012.2 In this study over 14 seasons, the ACL injury
rate fluctuated during the period seasons, but remained essen-
tially unchanged during the 2000s. The trend was rather for a
non-significant increase than a decline over the years.
Why has the ACL injury rate not decreased at the
professional level?
The finding that the ACL injury rate in male professional foot-
ball players is not declining is worrying, not the least as several
high-quality randomised controlled trials have shown that pre-
vention of ACL injuries is possible with neuromuscular training
programmes. Although most research to date has been con-
ducted in female players,18 19 there is recent evidence that ACL
injury rates can also be reduced in male players.20 Highly skilled
professional male senior football players have, however, not
been studied and it is possible that the underlying risk factors,
injury mechanisms and preventive strategies could be different
in this subgroup.
A debated risk factor in the literature and the football com-
munity is fatigue, but many of the ACL injuries actually occur
early in the first half or among newly substituted players in the
second half.8 This finding suggests that if fatigue is a risk factor,
it is probably more an effect of accumulated fatigue over time,
for example, owing to a congested match calendar21 22 than
energy depletion per se in the match where the ACL injury
occurs. In terms of potential different ACL injury mechanisms,
a recent systematic video analysis showed that the injury
mechanisms in professional male football players were similar to
those previously described for female athletes,23 making this
theory less likely. Finally, it could also be a problem with poor
adoption of evidence-based knee-protective exercises in this
setting, as has been shown recently for the case of hamstring
injuries.24 W
e speculate that the latter actually could be the
main reason, and we therefore recommend that the club
medical staff work in close collaboration with the head coach
and the fitness coach in order to implement evidence-based pre-
ventive measures.
High initial RTP rate within a year after ACL reconstruction
It is well known that release for RTP after injury/surgery is a
complex
process
depending
on
medical
and
non-medical
factors.25 In addition, a recent meta-analysis of 69 studies that
included 7556 patients, Ardern et al26 reported that only 65%
actually
returned
to
their
preinjury
level
following
ACL
reconstruction.
In male football players, however, several studies reported
RTP rates of 76% up to almost 100%.2 6 8 9 In this study, we
found that 100% of all players treated with ACL reconstruction
for a total rupture returned to football training. More than 90%
of the players also returned to match play within a year after

 ACL reconstruction, which is considerably higher than in a
recent
Australian
study
on
mixed
team
sports
in
which
two-thirds of patients had not returned by 1 year.27 Possible
reasons for this high RTP rate in our cohort might be early diag-
nostics, referral to experienced high-volume surgeons, daily
supervised rehabilitation by qualified physiotherapists, and big
financial
motivation
for
players
to
continue
to
play
professionally.28
Subsequent ACL injury after ACL reconstruction
Even if all ACL-reconstructed players were able to return to
training, five players (4%) suffered a rerupture during the final
phase of the rehabilitation or before their first match appear-
ance. In addition, another four players (3%) suffered early
reruptures within 3 months after their first match appearance
(data not shown), one even in his first match after release from
rehabilitation.
In
this
respect,
the
emerging
evidence
for
unacceptably high rates of subsequent ipsilateral graft rupture or
contralateral ACL rupture after ACL reconstruction is worry-
ing.29 30 Subsequent ACL ruptures are seen especially in younger
athletes who return to sports and were, in a recent systematic
review by Wiggins et al,29 calculated to be approximately 35
times higher than those for uninjured subjects. The risk for ipsi-
lateral graft rupture seems to be greatest in the first 2 years after
ACL reconstruction, and a relatively higher proportion of
contralateral ACL ruptures are seen with increasing follow-up
periods.30 The number of contralateral ACL ruptures was low in
this study, and this is most probably explained by the limited
individual follow-up times after 5 years postreconstruction.
From a strict medical perspective, a non-contact ipsilateral
graft and contralateral ACL rupture, or even another secondary
knee injury, occurring in the final phase of the rehabilitation
period or early after RTP should be regarded as a treatment
failure. Consequently, and in the light that only a minority of
clinical studies on ACL reconstruction report objective criteria
for return to sports,31 our results therefore strongly imply that
creating and validating clinical RTP criteria and test batteries to
prevent subsequent injury should be a prioritised research area
in the near future.
Methodological considerations
The study design strictly adhered to the consensus statement of
football injury surveillance,32 and the general strengths and lim-
itations of injury surveillance studies will therefore not be
repeated here in detail. Specifically for this substudy, the rigorous
ACL injury data monitoring and the large homogeneous sample
of professional football players are two important strengths.
This study also has some important limitations. First, in our
previous injury time-trend analyses, we have focused on fre-
quent injuries including hamstring injuries, MCL injuries of the
knee, and ankle sprains,3–5 16 and have found great agreement
between the regression and the 2-year MA models. In this study,
however, there was an apparent discrepancy between the models
with the 2-year MA approach indicating higher annual increases.
The most plausible explanation is that 2005/2006 was an
‘extreme season’ with an ACL injury rate of 0.13 per 1000 h
and
is
thus
represented
twice
in
the
MA
approach.
Consequently, the MA approach should be used with caution in
small samples with fluctuating injury rates between seasons.
Second, we have not examined the players or read the MRIs
ourselves and were thus dependent on the clubs’ medical staff in
classifying the ACL injuries as partial or total ruptures. Although
the clinical and radiological pictures are often straightforward, it
cannot be fully ruled out that a partial rupture might have been
classified as a total rupture and vice versa.
Third, the participating clubs were not provided with any spe-
cific RTP criteria in the study manual. It is therefore likely that
layoff times varied between clubs due to different diagnostics
and treatment algorithms.
Fourth, return to match play is more associated with non-
medical factors than medical factors compared with return to
training. For example, participation in match play also depends
on the ‘shirt number’, player performance, playing position,
match type, period of season, etc, all of which could influence
whether a player is selected by the coach. W
e have therefore
also included first team friendly, reserve team, under-21 and
national team matches in the return to match play statistics and
not first team competitive matches exclusively.
CONCLUSION
The ACL injury rate was 0.4 per team per season, which means
that a club on average will see an ACL injury every second
season. The training environment provides a very low risk of
ACL injury; the match play rate is 20-fold higher than during
training. In the 2000s, there has been no decline in the overall
ACL injury rate or the ACL match injury rate. All players were
able to return to training after ACL reconstruction, but the
rerupture (4%) and the need for other ipsilateral knee surgery
(3%) rates before return to match play was not trivial. Almost
two-thirds of players with ACL reconstruction for a total
rupture played at the same level 3 years after RTP
.
What are the findings?
▸ All players who underwent ACL reconstruction for a total
rupture returned to training, but the rerupture rate before
returning to match play was 4%.
▸ Only two-thirds of players who ruptured their ACL were still
playing at the highest level 3 years later.
▸ The ACL injury rate in male professional football players
showed no declining trend during the 2000s.
How might it impact on clinical practice in the future?
▸ Novel primary and secondary preventive measures are
urgently needed in this professional men’s football setting.
▸ Research should focus on valid and widely accepted clinical
return-to-play criteria to prevent recurrent injury.
