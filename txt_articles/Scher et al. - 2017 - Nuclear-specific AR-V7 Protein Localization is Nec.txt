 patients with improved overall survival (OS) on taxane therapy relative to the androgen receptor 
signaling inhibitors (ARSis) abiraterone acetate, enzalutamide, and apalutamide.
Objective—To evaluate if expanding the positivity criteria to include both nuclear and 
cytoplasmic AR-V7 localization (“nuclear-agnostic”) identifies more patients who would benefit 
from a taxane over an ARSi.
Design, setting, and participants—The study used a coss-sectional cohort. Between 
December 2012 and March 2015, 193 pretherapy blood samples, 191 of which were evaluable, 
were collected and processed from 161 unique mCRPC patients before starting a new line of 
systemic therapy because of disease progression at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. 
The association between two AR-V7 scoring criteria, post-therapy prostate-specific antigen 
change (PTPC) and OS following ARSi or taxane treatment, was explored. One criterion required 
nuclear-specific AR-V7 localization, and the other required an AR-V7 signal but was agnostic to 
protein localization in CTCs.
Outcome measurements and statistical analyses—Correlation of AR-V7 status to PTPC 
and OS was investigated. Relationships with survival were analyzed using multivariable Cox 
regression and log-rank analyses.
Results and limitations—A total of 34 (18%) samples were AR-V7-positive using nuclear-
specific criteria, and 56 (29%) were AR-V7-positive using nuclear-agnostic criteria. Following 
ARSi treatment, none of the 16 nuclear-specific AR-V7-positive samples and six of the 32 (19%) 
nuclear-agnostic AR-V7-positive samples had ≥50% PTPC at 12 wk. The strongest baseline factor 
influencing OS was the interaction between the presence of nuclear-specific AR-V7-positive CTCs 
and treatment with a taxane (hazard ratio 0.24, 95% confidence interval 0.078–0.79; p = 0.019). 
This interaction was not significant when nuclear-agnostic criteria were used.
Conclusions—To reliably inform treatment selection using an AR-V7 protein biomarker in 
CTCs, nuclear-specific localization is required.
Patient summary—We analyzed outcomes for patients with metastatic castration-resistant 
prostate cancer on androgen receptor signaling inhibitors and standard chemotherapy. Patients 
with circulating tumor cells that had AR-V7 protein in the cellular nuclei were very likely to 
survive longer on chemotherapy, and tests unable to distinguish where the protein is located in the 
cell are not as predictive of benefit.

1. Introduction
The increasing use of molecular profiling has revealed that each round of systemic therapy 
can change the biologic profile of a patient’s disease, supporting the need for serial analyses 
before each change in therapy to best inform therapy selection [1]. For this reason, each new 
line of therapy for progressing metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) 
represents a key clinical treatment decision according to the Prostate Cancer Working Group 
3 recommendations [1]. In the context of mCRPC management, a crucial decision is the

 choice between an androgen receptor signaling inhibitor (ARSi) or taxane-based 
chemotherapy, both approved and life-prolonging. For this context, therapy-guiding 
predictive biomarkers are an unmet medical need.
Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) can be obtained from routine phlebotomy samples with 
minimal patient discomfort, which allows profiling of cells from multiple lesions at once. By 
contrast, single-site tumor biopsies are invasive, costly, and difficult to repeat [2]. Androgen 
receptor splice variant 7 (AR-V7) contains a truncated C-terminal region lacking the ligand-
binding domain, allowing AR signaling to be activated independent of a ligand. Several 
groups have recently demonstrated that detection of AR-V7 mRNA in pooled, lysed CTCs 
from patients with progressing mCRPC [3–5] predicts disease resistance to ARSis [3]. 
However, mRNA-based methods have yet to identify patients who would live significantly 
longer if given a taxane when adjusting for preclinical features, such as line of therapy, in 
multivariate models [6].
How AR splice variants are regulated at the mRNA and protein levels are active areas of 
research. Studies evaluating AR-V7 in tissue samples typically require nuclear localization 
of AR-V7 protein to score positive, which cannot be assessed in pooled mRNA samples [7–
9]. Several reported tests for AR-V7 in CTCs have used epithelial cell adhesion molecule 
(EpCAM) enrichment capture followed by AR-V7 mRNA detection in pooled CTC 
aggregates [3,5,10] or detection of cell-free AR-V7 mRNA transcripts in whole blood [11]. 
The Epic Sciences platform uses a pathology slide–based, non-selection CTC detection 
method that allows assessment of AR-V7 protein presence and localization in individual 
CTCs [12].
In previous work, we validated a CTC AR-V7 protein assay in the context of use to predict 
response to ARSis or taxanes in patients with progressing mCRPC when a change in therapy 
was needed [12]. The AR-V7 CTC positivity criteria used in the study required nuclear-
specific protein localization [12], similar to previous reports using AR-V7 protein in 
metastatic biopsy samples [7–9]. The results showed that AR-V7 protein detection 
frequency in the nucleus of CTCs increased by line of therapy, ranging from 3% for the first 
line to 31% for the third line or greater. Detection of nuclear-specific AR-V7-positive CTCs 
before therapy was highly specific for lack of response to ARSis but not to taxanes, and 
demonstrated a statistically significant interaction between improved overall survival (OS) 
for patients on taxanes compared to ARSis [12]. The clinical benefit shown supports the 
clinical utility of the nuclear-specific AR-V7 protein assay in informing decisions to 
administer a taxane over an ARSi.
Of note, the rate of AR-V7 detection in CTCs using the nuclear-specific criteria was lower 
than the reported mRNA-based detection methods in comparable patient cohorts, averaging 
18% of patients with AR-V7-positive CTCs and 29–55% of patients positive for AR-V7 
mRNA transcripts [3,5]. Given the demonstrated importance of the AR-V7 biomarker, 
analytical and clinical validation of methodologies to measure AR-V7 cannot be understated 
[13]. However, it was hypothesized that strict nuclear-specific AR-V7 protein scoring in 
CTCs was too stringent, potentially sacrificing sensitivity to detect more patients who might 
benefit from taxanes over ARSis. Noting that a proportion of patient samples exhibited

 predominantly cytoplasmic AR-V7 protein expression, and presumably also expressing AR-
V7 mRNA transcripts, we evaluated whether expanding the AR-V7 scoring criteria to 
include both nuclear and cytoplasmic AR-V7 localization (“nuclear-agnostic”) could 
identify more patients who would have more favorable outcomes on taxane over ARSi 
therapy.
2. Patients and methods
2.1. Patient selection
Blood samples from patients with progressing mCRPC who were about to start a new line of 
ARS or taxane-based therapy were considered. Patient histories are outlined in Table 1. 
Castration status (serum testosterone <50 ng/dl) was confirmed via a standard blood panel. 
All patients signed consent to an institutional review board–approved protocol before sample 
collection.
2.2. Post-treatment outcomes
For each treatment course, antitumor effects were assessed as treatment-specific post-
therapy prostate-specific antigen (PSA) change (PTPC), as previously described [12]. All 
patients with “sensitive” PTPC had a ≥50% PSA decline at 12 w, and those with “resistant” 
PTPC did not achieve a 50% decline. For taxane patients, the maximum PSA decline may 
occur after 12 wk, in which case the later date was used. OS was calculated from initiation 
of therapy to death from any cause, with right-censoring for patients alive at last follow-up. 
For patients who were followed for more than one therapy, samples from all treatment 
decisions before the last were right-censored, with time calculated from initiation of therapy 
to date of next draw. The choice of therapy was made by the treating physician without 
knowledge of AR-V7 status.
2.3. CTC collection
Blood (7.5 ml) was collected in Streck tubes and processed at Memorial Sloan Kettering 
Cancer Center or shipped to Epic Sciences and processed within 48 h. After red blood cell 
lysis, approximately 3 000 000 nucleated cells were dispensed onto 10–16 glass microscope 
slides and placed at −80°C as previously described [14,15]. Sample processing and testing 
were conducted in laboratories following Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments 
(CLIA) regulations.
2.4. CTC immunofluorescent staining and analysis
CTC identification and characterization were performed as previously described [14,16]. In 
brief, pathology slides created from all nucleated cells in blood samples from mCRPC 
patients underwent automated immunofluorescent staining for DNA, cytokeratins (CK), 
CD45, and AR-V7 (Fig. 1) using a rabbit monoclonal anti-AR-V7 antibody (EPR15656, 
Abcam, Burlingame, CA, USA). The AR-V7 antibody specificity was comprehensively 
validated via western blots and single-cell PCR, as well as tissue microarrays (TMAs) 
containing malignant, tumor-adjacent, and healthy tissue samples, by a third party [12]. 
Fluorescent microscopes imaged every nucleated object on the slides, and morphology 
algorithms were used for identification of CTCs among nucleated blood cells on the slides.

 Classification as a CTC requires an intact nucleus (DNA dye, 4′,6-diamidino-2-
phenylindole [DAPI]), lack of CD45 staining (a blood lineage marker), and a distinct 
morphology from surrounding white blood cells. Clinical laboratory scientists (licensed in 
California) conducted final quality control of CTC identification and subcellular biomarker 
localization without knowledge of patient outcome.
Two different AR-V7 scoring criteria were used: one requiring nuclear-specific localization 
of a signal on top of a threshold cellular intensity (nuclear-specific) [12], and a second 
requiring a threshold signal intensity independent of localization (nuclear-agnostic). CTC 
images are nonconfocal images of whole cells (not sectioned, like in tissue), and diffuse 
localization in both cytoplasm and nucleus cannot necessarily be interpreted as a signal from 
proteins that have entered the nucleus of CTCs. Therefore, the nuclear-specific criterion 
requires a nondiffuse signal only in the nucleus to be considered positive. Samples with at 
least one AR-V7-positive CTC that met these criteria were considered AR-V7-positive.
2.5. Statistical analyses
Descriptive statistics were used to summarize patient demographics and clinical 
characteristics overall, by line of therapy, and by type of drug administered. Wilcoxon rank-
sum tests were used to compare treatment groups. Time-to-event outcome measures were 
evaluated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Differences in time-to-event outcomes between 
samples negative or positive for AR-V7 scoring criteria were evaluated using the log-rank 
test, with hazard ratios estimated from univariable and multivariable Cox proportional 
hazards (PH) regression methods.
Multivariable Cox PH models included pretherapy measures: PSA, alkaline phosphatase, 
lactate dehydrogenase, hemoglobin levels, line of therapy, type of therapy, and AR-V7 
status. Using a best subset selection method based on univariate significance (p < 0.05) and a 
global score χ2 statistic, the presence of liver and/or lung metastases, patient age, and 
albumin were excluded from the final model. These are the same model construction criteria 
previously utilized [12], but with the additional follow-up time and death events, a few of the 
covariates included changed from the previous model. All statistical tests were two-sided 
and were performed at the 5% significance level. KNIME [17] was utilized for data 
consolidation, and all statistical analyses were performed with the R v3.2.0 procedures 
survival and stats.
3. Results
The cohort included 191 evaluable pretherapy samples, including 128 pre-ARSi and 63 pre-
taxane samples, from 161 unique mCRPC patients [12]. Of the unique patients, 130 (80.8%) 
had a single therapy, 30 (18.6%) had two therapies (60 samples), and one (0.6%) had three 
therapies. A total of 74 patients succumbed to their disease.
3.1. AR-V7 protein can be localized to the cytoplasm or nucleus of CTCs
AR-V7 protein localization was identified in the nucleus (Fig. 1A), cytoplasm (Fig. 1B), and 
in single CTCs within CTC clusters (Fig. 1C). The incidence of nuclear-specific AR-V7-

 positive CTCs and nuclear-agnostic AR-V7-positive CTCs both increased with the line of 
therapy (Fig. 1D).
3.2. Nuclear-specific AR-V7 localization is required for the specificity of PSA response 
prediction for patients on ARSi
Of the 128 pre-ARSi samples in the cohort, 47 (37%) showed sensitive and 81 (63%) 
showed resistant PTPC. With the nuclear-specific scoring criterion, zero of 47 (0%) sensitive 
and 16 of 81 (20%) resistant pre-ARSi samples were AR-V7-positive (Fig. 2A). With the 
nuclear-agnostic scoring criterion, six of 47 (13%) sensitive and 26 of 81 (32%) resistant 
pre-ARSi samples were AR-V7-positive (Fig. 2B). Neither scoring criterion showed 
specificity for sensitive or resistant PTPC on taxane therapy (Fig. 2C, D).
3.3. Nuclear-specific AR-V7 localization improves prognostication of OS for patients on 
ARSi
Pre-ARSi samples with AR-V7-positive CTCs according to either the nuclear-specific (Fig. 
3A) or nuclear-agnostic criterion (Fig. 3B) had less favorable OS compared to AR-V7-
negative samples. However, the magnitude of the difference in OS when using nuclear-
specific localization was much greater (HR 10.4, p < 0.0001 vs HR 4.3, p < 0.0001) and the 
median OS was shorter (4.6 vs 10.0 mo). Pre-taxane samples with AR-V7-positive CTCs 
according to either criterion had poorer OS compared to those without (HR 3.2, p = 0.0005 
vs HR 3.2, p = 0.0007) and similar median OS (8.9 vs 9.2 mo).
3.4. Nuclear-specific AR-V7 localization is necessary for prediction of treatment-specific 
reduction in risk of death
A higher proportion of patients receiving taxanes were on their third or later line of therapy 
compared to those on ARSis (67% vs 25%). Despite this, patients with nuclear-specific AR-
V7 positivity had better median survival times on taxane therapy than on ARSis (8.9 vs 4.6 
mo).
Multivariate analysis updated from that previously reported [12] incorporating the additional 
follow-up time and more death events again showed that the interaction between the 
presence of pretherapy nuclear-specific AR-V7-positive CTCs and the therapy administered 
was the most significant factor influencing OS. Patients classified as having AR-V7-positive 
CTCs using the nuclear-specific scoring criterion had a significantly lower risk of death on 
taxanes (HR 0.24, 95% CI 0.078–0.79; p = 0.019; Fig. 4A). Using an identically constructed 
multivariate model and changing only the criterion for AR-V7 positivity to nuclear-agnostic, 
both AR-V7 and the interaction between AR-V7 and therapy lost significance (HR 0.73, 
95% CI 0.26–2.04; p = 0.55; Fig. 4B).
4. Discussion
Within the clinical context of choosing an ARSi versus taxane therapy for progressing 
mCRPC, most patients prefer the former given the ease of administration and the more 
favorable safety profile. The decision to choose a cytotoxic drug is therefore not taken 
lightly. Thus, it is essential that the false positive rate of any therapy-guiding predictive

 biomarker at this decision point in mCRPC be as low as possible. Here, the defined 
biomarker was based on detection of nuclear-specific AR-V7 protein in CTCs collected 
from mCRPC patients before ARSi or taxane treatment [12]. We showed the significance 
and clinical utility of nuclear-specific versus nuclear-agnostic AR-V7-positive localization in 
terms of improved specificity of resistant PTPC prediction for patients on ARSis, combined 
with more favorable survival demonstrated using an alternative, US Food and Drug 
Administration–approved life-prolonging therapeutic class (taxanes). The results are 
consistent with the known biology of the AR-V7 splice variant.
In the entire cohort, containing both pre-ARSi and pre-taxane samples, 34 of 191 (18%) 
were positive for AR-V7 using the nuclear-specific protein criterion, and 56 of 191 (29%) 
using the nuclear-agnostic scoring criterion. Among the 128 pre-ARSi samples, 16 were 
AR-V7-positive according to the nuclear-specific and 32 were positive according to the 
nuclear-agnostic scoring criterion, for which the median survival was 4.6 and 10 mo, 
respectively (Fig. 3). None of the 16 nuclear-specific AR-V7-positive samples showed 
sensitive PTPC, in contrast to six of the additional 16 (38%) nuclear-agnostic samples, a 
false-positive result, relative to the nuclear-specific criterion, that could potentially deny a 
patient a minimally toxic, safe, life-prolonging therapy (Fig. 2).
Critically, with additional follow-up time and death events, the nuclear-specific AR-V7 
protein scoring criterion retained a significant treatment-specific reduction in risk of death 
for patients on taxanes, and was the most predictive pretreatment clinical feature influencing 
patient survival (HR 0.24, 95% CI 0.078–0.79; p = 0.019; Fig. 4A). The nuclear-agnostic 
AR-V7 scoring criterion had less magnitude for prognosticating outcome for patients on 
ARSi therapy (Fig. 3) and failed to show a treatment-specific interaction (Fig. 4B), 
indicating that patients considered positive according to this criterion were not predicted to 
have improved OS on an already-defined alternative therapy (taxanes).
The nuclear-specific AR-V7 protein localization requirement for positivity in studies 
exploring the relationship between biomarker presence and outcome is based on the 
recognition that downstream AR signaling does not occur until AR transcriptional elements 
bind to DNA [7–9]. Full-length AR protein has a nuclear localization sequence motif that is 
exposed on androgen binding, resulting in conformational changes to the protein that allow 
nuclear translocation so that DNA binding can occur [18,19]. AR-V7 is truncated after exon 
3, and as a result lacks the complete nuclear localization sequence of full-length AR [20,21]. 
Despite this, the AR-V7 protein does localize to the nucleus of rapidly growing cells in 
culture [22], in transgenic prostate cancer models [23], and in human solid tumor tissues 
[3,7–9,24]. Exactly how localization of this truncated protein occurs is an area of active 
research, but it may be related to the unique C-terminal sequence present in the AR-V7 
molecule [22].
The patients included in this study were treated in a routine clinical practice setting with 
agents that are already FDA approved. Overall, 12% of samples had AR-V7 signal that was 
not nuclear-specific, a scoring criteria that did not predict resistance to ARSis with the 
specificity needed at this clinical decision point. Only nuclear-specific AR-V7 protein in 
CTCs demonstrated therapy-changing clinical utility through both a low false-positive rate

 (PTPC) and significantly lower risk of death on taxanes (multivariate, OS), which, in 
combination, justify a change of therapy in this clinical decision.
Our results highlight an important limitation of mRNA-based approaches in CTCs: the 
inability to determine whether the AR-V7 message has been translated into protein and, if 
so, whether the protein is present in the nucleus, where it is known to function as an 
oncogenic driver of tumor growth. A prospective clinical trial testing the predictive capacity 
of pooled CTC AR-V7 mRNA and nuclear-specific AR-V7 protein in matched samples is 
ongoing (NCT02269982).
Despite high specificity for predicting resistant PTPC, the presence of nuclear-specific AR-
V7 identified only 16 of 81 (20%) of the samples that showed resistant PTPC. This result is 
not surprising given other mechanisms of resistance to ARSis that have been reported 
beyond AR-V7, including signaling driven via AR gene mutations [25], reciprocal feedback 
via PTEN loss [15,26], and the development of a neuroendocrine phenotype of prostate 
cancer [27]. Biomarker assays that identify other resistance mechanisms will need to be 
analytically and clinically validated with the same rigor as that applied to AR-V7.
5. Conclusions
Expanding the AR-V7 protein scoring criteria for CTCs from nuclear-specific to include 
both nuclear and/or cytoplasmic AR-V7 localization (“nuclear-agnostic”) confirmed that 
nuclear-specific protein localization is required to reliably inform treatment selection 
between ARSis and taxanes using a CTC AR-V7 biomarker.

Expanding the AR-V7 protein scoring criteria for circulating tumor cells (CTCs) from 
nuclear-specific to include both nuclear and/or cytoplasmic AR-V7 localization 
(“nuclear-agnostic”) confirmed that nuclear-specific protein localization is required to 
reliably inform treatment selection between androgen receptor signaling inhibitors and 
taxanes using a CTC AR-V7 biomarker.

AR-V7 protein can be localized to the nucleus and/or cytoplasm of circulating tumor cells 
(CTCs). Example images show (A) individual CTCs with AR-V7 nuclear-specific 
localization, (B) CTC with predominantly cytoplasmic AR-V7 staining and (C) CTC cluster 
with varying AR-V7 expression. (D) Sample-level positivity for these CTCs. DAPI = 4′,6-
diamidino-2-phenylindole; CK = cytokeratin.

Nuclear-specific AR-V7 localization is required for specificity of PTPC for patients on 
ARSi therapy. Waterfall plots of the percentage change in PSA at 12 wk on therapy, 
stratified by the number of previous lines of therapy. Each bar represents an individual 
patient. (A) Pre-ARSi AR-V7 status according to nuclear-specific localization only. (B) Pre-
ARSi AR-V7 status according to nuclear-agnostic localization. (C) Pre-taxane AR-V7 status 
according to nuclear-specific localization only. (D) Pre-taxane AR-V7 status according to 
nuclear-agnostic localization. PSA = prostate-specific antigen; PTPC = post-therapy PSA 
change; ARSi = androgen receptor signaling inhibitor. * Longer than 12 wk (see the text).

Nuclear-specific AR-V7 localization improves prognostication of overall survival (OS) for 
patients on ARSi therapy. OS is shown for patient samples stratified by pre-ARSi AR-V7 
status (n = 128) determined according to (A) nuclear-specific localization and (B) nuclear-
agnostic localization and stratified by pre-taxane AR-V7 status (n = 63) determined 
according to (C) nuclear-specific localization and (D) nuclear-agnostic localization. ARSi = 
androgen receptor signaling inhibitor.

Nuclear-specific AR-V7 localization is necessary for prediction of a treatment-specific 
reduction in risk of death. Individual covariates were tested for additive power in predicting 
outcome using a Cox proportional hazards model. The p values are the result of 
compensating for the other factors listed. The interaction of therapy and AR-V7 status was 
further investigated using a multivariable Cox proportional hazards model. The forest plot 
shows the hazard ratio and 95% confidence interval (CI) for (A) a cohort evaluated for AR-
V7 positivity utilizing nuclear-specific localization and (B) a cohort evaluated for positivity 
utilizing nuclear-agnostic localization. ARSi = androgen receptor signaling inhibitor; PSA = 
prostate-specific antigen; phos. = phosphatase; LDH = lactate dehydrogenase.
