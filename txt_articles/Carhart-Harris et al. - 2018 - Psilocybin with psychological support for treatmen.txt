Abstract
Rationale Recent clinical trials are reporting marked improve-
ments in mental health outcomes with psychedelic drug-assisted
psychotherapy.
Objectives Here, we report on safety and efficacy outcomes for
up to 6 months in an open-label trial of psilocybin for treatment-
resistant depression.
Methods Twenty patients (six females) with (mostly) se-
vere, unipolar, treatment-resistant major depression re-
ceived two oral doses of psilocybin (10 and 25 mg, 7 days
apart) in a supportive setting. Depressive symptoms were
assessed from 1 week to 6 months post-treatment, with
the self-rated QIDS-SR16 as the primary outcome
measure.
Results Treatment was generally well tolerated. Relative to base-
line, marked reductions in depressive symptoms were observed
for the first 5 weeks post-treatment (Cohen’s d = 2.2 at week 1
and 2.3 at week 5, both p < 0.001); nine and four patients met the
criteria for response and remission at week 5. Results remained
positive at 3 and 6 months (Cohen’s d = 1.5 and 1.4, respectively,
both p < 0.001). No patients sought conventional antidepressant
treatment within 5 weeks of psilocybin. Reductions in depressive
symptoms at 5 weeks were predicted by the quality of the acute
psychedelic experience.
Conclusions Although limited conclusions can be drawn
about treatment efficacy from open-label trials, tolerability
was good, effect sizes large and symptom improvements ap-
peared rapidly after just two psilocybin treatment sessions and
remained significant 6 months post-treatment in a treatment-
resistant cohort. Psilocybin represents a promising paradigm
for unresponsive depression that warrants further research in
double-blind randomised control trials.

Introduction
Psilocybin is a naturally occurring plant alkaloid that is being
increasingly researched as treatment for a range of different
psychiatric disorders (Carhart-Harris and Goodwin 2017).
Four separate trials have reported improvements in depressive
symptoms after psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy (Griffiths
et al. 2016; Ross et al. 2016; Grob et al. 2011; Carhart-
Harris et al. 2016), including one in which ‘treatment-resistant
depression’ was the primary criterion for inclusion (Carhart-
Harris et al. 2016). Psilocybin has shown promise in the treat-
ment of obsessive compulsive disorder (Moreno et al. 2006),
alcohol (Bogenschutz et al. 2015) and tobacco addiction
(Johnson et al. 2014) and anxiety related to terminal diagnoses
(Griffiths et al. 2016; Ross et al. 2016; Grob et al. 2011).
Treatment procedures typically involve psychological prepa-
ration prior to one or two therapist-supported drug sessions
followed by psychological integration. Using a consistent
model (i.e. involving appropriate psychological support),
sustained improvements in well-being in healthy individuals
were observed after a single dose of psilocybin in a double-
blind design incorporating an active placebo (Griffiths et al.
2008).
Studies involving other serotonergic psychedelics com-
bined with psychological support have found similarly prom-
ising outcomes: Sustained reductions in end-of-life anxiety
were observed after LSD-assisted psychotherapy (Gasser
et al. 2014), and reduced depressive symptoms were seen after
ayahuasca in patients with ‘recurrent depression’ (Osorio Fde
et al. 2015; Sanches et al. 2016). Naturalistic, observational
studies of ayahuasca support its long-term well-being promot-
ing and anti-addiction properties (Thomas et al. 2013; Bouso
et al. 2012) and a recent population survey found lower rates
of suicidality and psychological distress in association with
psychedelic drug use (Hendricks et al. 2015)—an anomalous
association for a drug of potential misuse. Drug experts and
users have consistently rated psilocybin as the least harmful
and potentially ‘most beneficial’ drug of potential misuse
(Carhart-Harris and Nutt 2013; van Amsterdam et al.
2015)—although the influence of context (e.g. expectations
and environmental factors) on potential harms and benefits
has been much emphasised (Hartogsohn 2016; Carhart-
Harris et al., in review). Further evidence favouring the ther-
apeutic potential of psychedelics can be found in literature
documenting the extensive research carried out with these
compounds in the mid-twentieth century, e.g. two relevant
meta-analyses have found positive safety and efficacy data
for LSD for alcohol dependence (Krebs and Johansen 2012)
and mood disorders (Rucker et al. 2016). See Carhart-Harris
and Goodwin (2017) for a review of historical and recent trials
with psychedelics.
Like all serotonergic psychedelics, psilocybin initiates its
characteristic effects via serotonin 2A receptor (5-HT2AR)
agonism (Vollenweider et al. 1998). 5-HT2AR signalling has
been associated with better responses to conventional antide-
pressants (Qesseveur et al. 2016; Petit et al. 2014), and pre-
clinical work indicates that 5-HT2AR signalling may mediate
(at least some of) the therapeutic effects of SSRIs (Nic
Dhonnchadha et al. 2005; Buchborn et al. 2014).
Paradoxically, 5-HT2AR antagonists have been found to aug-
ment the antidepressant effects of SSRIs (Ostroff and Nelson
1999) and many effective antidepressant augmentation medi-
cations have 5-HT2AR antagonist properties (Carpenter et al.
1999). This paradox implies that 5-HT2AR agonism and an-
tagonism can achieve consistent ends, in terms of alleviating
depressive symptoms, but via different mechanisms (see
Carhart-Harris et al. (2017) and Carhart-Harris and Nutt
(2017) for a relevant discussion).
The present report documents an extension to our recently
published pilot study assessing psilocybin with psychological
support for treatment-resistant depression. The number of pa-
tients treated was increased from 12 to 20 and the follow-up
period extended from 3 to 6 months.
Methods
Approvals and drug source
This clinical trial received a favourable opinion from the
National Research Ethics Service (NRES) London-West
London, was sponsored and approved by Imperial College
London’s Joint Research and Complication Organisation
(JRCO), was adopted by the National Institute of Health
Research (NIHR) Clinical Research Network (CRN) and
was reviewed and approved by the Medicines and
Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). A Home
Office Licence for storage and dispensing of Schedule One
drugs was obtained. Psilocybin was obtained from THC
Pharm (Frankfurt) and formulated into the investigational me-
dicinal product (5 mg psilocybin in size 0 capsules) by Guy’s
and St Thomas’ Hospital’s Pharmacy Manufacturing Unit
(London, UK).
Study design
This was an open-label feasibility study in 20 patients with
treatment-resistant depression. Treatment involved two oral
doses of psilocybin (10 and 25 mg), 7 days apart. The primary
outcome was mean change in the severity of self-reported
(SR) depressive symptoms (measured primarily with the 16-
400
Psychopharmacology (2018) 235:399–408
 item Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptoms, QIDS-SR16)
from baseline to specific time points after the high-dose psi-
locybin session (henceforth referred to as ‘post-treatment’).
QIDS-SR16 ratings were collected 1–3 and 5 weeks and 3
and 6 months post-treatment, with 5 weeks post-treatment
regarded as the primary endpoint. BDI (depression) and
STAI (anxiety) ratings were collected at 1 week and 3 and
6 months. SHAPS (anhedonia) was collected at 1 week and
3 months and HAM-D (depression, clinician-administered)
and GAF (global functioning, clinician administered) ratings
were collected at 1 week only. These secondary measures
were collected to enable comparisons to be made with other
studies that use the same measures. For this reason and since
they were highly correlated with the primary outcome mea-
sure, we chose not to correct for their use. A revised α of 0.05/
6 = 0.0083 for the six post-treatment QIDS-SR16 contrasts vs
baseline was used however.
Trial procedures
Full details of trial procedures can be found in Carhart-Harris
et al. (2016). Briefly, patients contacted the study team after
which a telephone screen was organised with the main study
psychiatrist. After checking eligibility criteria, candidates
were invited for a screening visit at the Imperial Clinical
Research Facility (ICRF) at the Hammersmith Hospital. This
comprised of informed consent, documenting mental and
physical health backgrounds, a psychiatric interview (MINI-
5) to confirm diagnosis, physical examination, routine blood
tests, ECG, urine test for drugs of abuse and pregnancy where
relevant, a breathalyser and the completion of baseline
assessments.
The main inclusion criteria were as follows: unipolar major
depression of at least moderate severity (16+ on the 21-item
HAM-D) and no improvement despite two courses of phar-
macologically distinct antidepressant medications for an ade-
quate duration (6 weeks minimum) within the current episode.
Main exclusion criteria were as follows: a current or previous-
ly diagnosed psychotic disorder or an immediate family mem-
ber with a diagnosed psychotic disorder.
Patients’ mental health histories were confirmed with their
GP or psychiatrist prior to study entry. With the exception of
patient 2 (Table 1), eligible patients medicated with an antide-
pressant were advised to stop this for the trial, to avoid
suspected attenuation of psilocybin’s effects (Bonson et al.
1996). This was done in a tapered manner under careful su-
pervision from the study psychiatrist. Washout occurred over
at least 2 weeks prior to study entry, with the exception of
patient 6, who stopped tramadol use only after the first psilo-
cybin session (when the tramadol use was discovered).
Eligible patients attended a pretreatment MRI scan and
psychological preparation visit, followed by two dosing ses-
sions, separated by 1 week. In the first session, patients
received 10 mg psilocybin and in the second, 25 mg.
Patients were seen the following day for debriefing and a
post-treatment MRI scan, and for one final time 1 week after
the 25-mg session. Subsequent follow-up measures were col-
lected remotely. Patients emailed their completed question-
naires to the study team. Six-month follow-up interviews were
carried out by RW with all 20 patients and the relevant qual-
itative data are reported elsewhere (Watts et al. 2017).
Reporting Side effects
Side effects were documented based on patient reports in re-
sponse to the question: BHave you experienced any side ef-
fects in relation to the treatment?^ This was asked at all post-
treatment visits and any spontaneously reported or observed
side effects were also documented.
Psychological support
Psychological support comprised of three components: (1)
preparation (P), (2) acute and peri-acute support (S) and (3)
integration (I). (1) Preparation (P) involves getting to know
the patient and his/her background, building a relationship of
trust and providing some information on what can be expected
from psilocybin and how best to navigate its effects. (2)
Support (S) involves being physically and emotionally present
for the patient before, during and after the acute drug session.
It may incorporate empathetic listening and reassurance, for
example. (3) Integration (I) involves non-judgmental listening
to the patient’s testimony after his/her experience and may
occasionally feature some interpretation regarding the content
of the experience and its potential meaning, as well as advice
regarding maintaining and cultivating positive changes in out-
look and lifestyle. We assign the acronym PSI to these core
components of psychological support.
11-Dimension altered states of consciousness (11D-ASC)
questionnaire
This is a 94-item questionnaire, of which 44 items are scored.
The 44 items are factorised according to a previous validation
paper (Studerus et al. 2010). Each item is scored as in a visual
analogue scale with the upper anchor reading Bmuch more
than usual^ and the bottom one reading Bno more than usual^.
Patients performed the 11D-ASC at the end of each dosing
day when the subjective effects of psilocybin had subsided to
a negligible level; however, ratings were done with reference
to the period when effects were most intense. t tests with
Bonferroni correction (revised α = 0.05/11 = 0.0045)
contrasted scores for the 10- and 25-mg dose sessions.

 Data analysis
Two-tailed paired t tests were performed for all pre- vs post-
treatment QIDS-S16 contrasts, with Bonferroni corrected α of
0.05/6 = 0.0083 for the six post-treatment time intervals. 95%
confidence intervals (CI) are provided. Effect sizes were cal-
culated using Cohen’s d values for dependent data. We chose
not to correct for additional clinical measures beyond
correcting for QIDS-SR16 changes at multiple time points.
This decision was made so as to avoid introducing type 2
errors through overly conservative correction and because of
the high covariance between clinical measures (see BResults^
section). For transparency, we provide all relevant p values
and effect sizes.
Results
Patients
One hundred and twenty people expressed an interest in the
study. Seventy-four were considered appropriate for a tele-
phone screen, from which 29 were invited for a screening
visit. Twenty were ultimately recruited for the trial and 19
completed all measures. Data on 12 of the 20 have been pre-
viously reported (Carhart-Harris et al. 2016) and these 12 are
included in the present analysis. Patients’ demographic and
clinical characteristics are shown in Table 1. Eighteen of the
20 patients met the criteria for severe or very severe depres-
sion at baseline (QIDS-SR16 score of ≥ 16); the remaining
two meeting the criteria for Bmoderate^ depression (QIDS-
SR16 score ≥ 11, < 16). The median number of (lifetime)
failed previous medications was 4, the mean was 4.6 ± 2.6
and the maximum was 11. The mean duration of illness of the
sample was 17.7 ± 8.4 years (range = 7–30 years), as assessed
by the question: BFor how long has your current depression
lasted?^ Note that none of the demographic variables were
predictive of treatment response, including past use of
psilocybin.
Data were analysed for the 19 who completed all assess-
ment time points. Relative to baseline, QIDS-SR16 scores
were significantly reduced at all six post-treatment time points
(p < 0.001), with the maximum effect size at 5 weeks (− 9.2,
95% CI = − 11.8 to − 6.6, t = − 7.2, p < 0.001, Cohen’s d = 2.3)
(see Fig. 1). Of the 19 patients who completed all assessments,
all showed some reduction in depression severity at 1 week
and these were sustained in the majority for 3–5 weeks.
Changes in HAM-D ratings from baseline to 1-week post-
treatment showed a reasonable correspondence with changes
in QIDS-SR16 data across the same period (r = 0.61,
p < 0.001) and the relationship between the QIDS-SR16 and
BDI at 1 week was very strong (r = 0.81, p < 0.001).
BDI scores were significantly reduced at 1 week (mean
reduction = − 22.7, 95% CI = − 17.6 to − 27.8, p < 0.001),
3 months (mean reduction = − 15.3, 95% CI = − 8.7 to − 21.9,
p < 0.001) and 6 months post-treatment (mean reduc-
tion = − 14.9, 95% CI = − 8.7 to − 21.1, p < 0.001); STAI-T
anxiety scores were significantly reduced at 1 week (mean
reduction = − 23.8, 95% CI = − 16.5 to − 31.1, p < 0.001),
3 months (mean reduction = − 12.2, 95% CI = − 6.1 to − 18.3,
p < 0.001) and 6 months post-treatment (mean reduc-
tion = − 14.8, 95% CI = − 8.1 to − 21.6, p < 0.001); SHAPS
anhedonia scores were significantly reduced at 1 week (mean
reduction = − 4.6, 95% CI = − 2.6 to − 6.6, p < 0.001) and
3 months post-treatment (mean reduction = − 3.3, 95%
CI = − 1.1 to − 5.5, p = 0.005); HAM-D scores were signif-
icantly reduced at 1 week post-treatment (mean reduc-
tion = − 14.8, 95% CI = − 11 to − 18.6, p < 0.001); and
GAF scores were significantly increased 1 week post-
treatment (mean increase = + 25.3, 95% CI = 17.1 to 33.5,
p < 0.001)—see Table 2.
Treatment was generally well tolerated and there were no
serious adverse events. One patient became uncommunicative
during the peak of his 25-mg psilocybin experience but this
normalised after the acute drug effects had abated. Follow-up
discussions revealed that his experience had been Bblissful^
and beneficial but also overwhelming (see supplementary
file). Regretfully, this patient chose not to complete further
follow-up measures, with the exception of the QIDS-SR16
and BDI scores at 6 months post-treatment. Follow-up scores
were 25 (QIDS) and 40 (BDI) at 6 months. See Watts et al.
(2017) for more details about individual cases.
A brief note: this experience, combined with evidence
supporting the importance of patient-therapist rapport in the
psychedelic treatment model (e.g. Carhart-Harris et al., in re-
view), has motivated us to revise the exclusion criteria for
future psilocybin trials, i.e. with Bpsychiatric condition judged
to be incompatible with establishment of rapport with therapy
team and/or safe exposure to psilocybin, e.g. suspected bor-
derline personality disorder^ added as a criterion for
exclusion.
Consistent with our earlier report on the initial 12 patients
from this trial (Carhart-Harris et al. 2016), transient anxiety
lasting for minutes (n = 15) and headaches lasting no more
than 1–2 days (n = 8) were the most common side effects. Five
reported transient nausea but there were no cases of vomiting.
Three reported transient paranoia within the duration of the
acute drug experience but this was short-lived in every case.
As with all our previous work with this compound, there were
no reported cases of so-called flashbacks or persisting percep-
tual changes.
Fourteen patients reported visions of an autobiographical
nature. In most cases, such visions were regarded as insightful
and informative. One patient reported a vision of his father
attempting to physically harm him when he was child,
Psychopharmacology (2018) 235:399–408
403
 something he claimed not to have been previously conscious
of. This patient subsequently felt confused about the authen-
ticity of this putative memory and this was associated with a
transient worsening of symptoms (see weeks 2 and 3 in fig.
S1). Appealing to clinical equipoise, the study team felt it best
practice not to make a judgement on the veridicality of this
alleged memory but open and compassionate listening was
maintained and the patient subsequently improved.
Suicidality scores on the QIDS-SR16 were significantly
reduced 1 and 2 weeks post-treatment (mean reductions at
week 1 = − 0.9, 95% CI = − 0.4 to − 1.4, p < 0.002; mean
reduction at week 2 = − 0.85, 95% CI = − 0.4 to − 1.3,
p = 0.004), with trend decreases at 3 (mean reduction = − 0.8,
95% CI = − 0.25 to − 1.3, p = 0.01) and 5 weeks (mean
reduction = − 0.7, 95% CI = − 0.22 to − 1.2, p = 0.01).
Scores on the suicide item of the HAM-D were significantly
decreased 1-week post-treatment (mean reduction = − 0.95,
95% CI = − 0.58 to − 1.3, p < 0.001), with 16 of 19 patients
scoring 0 at this time point and none showing an increase from
baseline nor scoring the maximum on this measure. Scores on
the genital/sexual dysfunction item of the HAM-D were also
significantly reduced 1-week post-treatment (mean reduc-
tion = − 0.58, 95% CI = − 0.18 to − 0.98, p = 0.002) and no
one scored the maximum nor showed an increase in sexual
dysfunction from baseline.
The complete 11D-ASC scores can be found in the supple-
mentary file. After Bonferroni correction (0.05/11 = 0.004),
values for experience of unity (mean difference = 0.26, 95%
CI = 0.12 to 0.41, p = 0.001), spiritual experience (mean
difference = 0.28, 95% CI = 0.11 to 0.41, p < 0.001), blissful
state (mean difference = 0.3, 95% CI = 0.16 to 0.44,
p < 0.001), insightfulness (mean difference = 0.26, 95%
CI = 0.11 to 0.41, p < 0.001) and complex imagery (mean
difference = 0.18, 95% CI = 0.08 to 0.28, p < 0.001) were
found to be significantly higher after 25 mg psilocybin than
the 10-mg dose.
Previous work has indicated a strong relationship between
the following 11D-ASC factors: experience of unity, spiritual
experience and blissful state (Studerus et al. 2010); and a
multiple correlation analysis confirmed their inter-
relatedness here (r > 0.92 for all permutations). We therefore
decided to treat them as one factor (assigned the acronym
‘USB’), taking mean values for each patient. Testing the hy-
pothesis that this USB factor and insight would predict better
clinical outcomes, we found significant relationships between
mean scores of USB and insight (Fig. 2) during the 25-mg
psilocybin experience and changes in QIDS-SR16 scores at
5 weeks (r = − 0.49, p = 0.03 and r = − 0.57, p = 0.01,
respectively).
After the 6-month endpoint, information was collected on
other treatments received by the patients (Watts et al. 2017).
With the exception of patient 2 (who remained on venlafaxine
throughout the trial and also received CBTshortly afterwards),
no patients received additional treatments within 5 weeks of
the 25-mg psilocybin dose. Six began new courses of antide-
pressant medication after the 3-month time point. Five re-
ceived psychotherapy (CBT, psychodynamic, counselling
and group therapy × 2) shortly before or after the 3-month

calculated for the 19 completers. Data are shown for the QIDS scores of
16–20 considered to reflect severe depression. All post-treatment assess-

represented by the black horizontal bars with positive standard errors also

 period and five sought and successfully obtained psilocybin
(without sanction from the study team) between 3 and
6 months. Removing the five that obtained psilocybin from
the 3- and 6-month analyses did not substantially alter the
main results: at 3 months, the effect size increased to 1.6 and
the p value remained < 0.001; and at 6 months, the effect size
increased to 1.7 and the p value became 0.018.
Assessing relapse at 6 months in responders (at 5 weeks)
revealed only three of nine cases—with the remaining six
maintaining response—even when using conservative criteria
for relapse of QIDS score of 6+ or above at 6 months. These
data tentatively imply that psilocybin may protect against re-
lapse to an equivalent extent to daily use of an established
antidepressant—as seen in discontinuation trials where re-
sponders either continue on medication (33% relapse) or
transfer to placebo (46% relapse) for 6 months (Gueorguieva
et al. 2017). Two major caveats here, however, are that one
cannot reliably extrapolate from a sample of nine, and whereas
patients in our trial received no interventions from us beyond
the integration work done 1 week after their 25-mg psilocybin
session, patients in clinical trials typically ingest a potentially
active antidepressant daily for 6 months.
Discussion
This paper presents updated and extended data from an open-
label clinical trial assessing psilocybin with psychological
support for treatment-resistant depression. Findings corrobo-
rate our (Carhart-Harris et al. 2016) and others’ previous re-
sults (Griffiths et al. 2016; Ross et al. 2016; Grob et al. 2011)
supporting the safety and efficacy of psilocybin for depressive
and anxiety symptoms. A fast and sustained response exceed-
ing what might be expected from a placebo response was
observed in many of the patients (see Carhart-Harris and
Nutt (2016) for a relevant discussion). Notably, all 19 com-
pleters showed some reductions in the QIDS-SR16 scores at
1-week post-treatment and (nominally) maximal effects were
seen at 5 weeks. Other interventions, not formally part of the
present trial, confounded outcomes at 3 and 6 months, al-
though safety was maintained and a sizeable proportion of
the sample continued to demonstrate benefit (see Watts et al.
(2017) for more details). Conclusions on efficacy are limited
by the absence of a control condition in this trial, however.
Recent studies (Griffiths et al. 2016; Ross et al. 2016;
Carhart-Harris et al. 2016), including the present one, help
demonstrate the feasibility of treating patients with major de-
pressive disorder with psilocybin plus psychological support.
Two recent double-blind randomised control trials (RCTs) of
psilocybin for depression and anxiety symptoms in a com-
bined sample of 80 patients with life-threatening cancer found
consistent safety and efficacy outcomes with those reported
here (Griffiths et al. 2016; Ross et al. 2016). Only a subset of

 patients recruited into these studies met the criteria for major
depressive disorder however, and symptoms were not of the
same severity as those seen here (i.e. mean baseline BDI
scores were 18.1 and 16 in the Griffiths et al. and Ross et al.
studies, respectively, whereas they were 35 in the present
study). A comprehensive RCT designed to properly assess
psilocybin’s efficacy for major depressive disorder, with some
form of placebo control, is therefore warranted (Carhart-
Harris and Goodwin 2017).
Regarding mechanisms, we recently proposed a model by
which psychedelic-induced 5-HT2AR signalling rapidly in-
duces an acute state of plasticity in which an enriched context
(Carhart-Harris et al., in review) may lead to cognitive biases
being revised (Carhart-Harris and Nutt 2017; Carhart-Harris
and Goodwin 2017)—see also Branchi (2011). The above-
reported correlation between acute ‘insightfulness’ and endur-
ing reductions in depressive symptoms may be viewed as
broadly supportive of this model. Moreover, recently pub-
lished fMRI data collected as part of the present trial may help
to develop and refine this model (Roseman et al., in review;
Carhart-Harris et al., in review).
Future research should endeavour to better characterise,
control and measure the various psychological components
contained within the current psychedelic treatment model.
There is an assumption that individuals under the influence
of a psychedelic are especially sensitive to the context in
which the experience occurs, both in terms of (1) prior expec-
tations and other relevant state and trait factors and (2) envi-
ronmental factors, e.g. the quality of the relationships with
persons attending to them before, during and after the experi-
ence and patients’ relationship to the music listened to during
the sessions (Kaelen et al. 2015)—and this matter has recently
been discussed in length (Carhart-Harris et al., in review). In
order to properly assess the relative contribution of these var-
iables and their assumed interactions with psilocybin, it will
be necessary to properly control and measure them, and this
has presently not yet been done to a satisfactory level (see
Carhart-Harris et al. (in review) for suggestions on how this
might be done).
Relatedly, psychotherapeutic models used to support and
mediate the psilocybin experience need to be better defined,
tested and potentially manualised. Basic principles for safe
therapeutic work with psychedelics can be found in guidelines
(Johnson et al. 2008) and books (Richards 2015) but more
systematic verification, refinement and (eventual)
manualisation of treatment approaches are needed for subse-
quent roll-out (Carhart-Harris and Goodwin 2017). Moreover,
cost-effectiveness will become increasingly salient as the de-
velopment of psilocybin as a treatment model progresses. The
major qualifier here is that experiments intended to evaluate
the contribution of psychological variables to the psychedelic
experience need to be conceived and conducted with an ap-
preciation of the special vulnerability of individuals under the
influence of psychedelics (again, see Carhart-Harris et al. (in
review). Thus, certain standards of care, including a certain
level of psychological support, may be non-negotiable if safe-
ty is to be maintained.
An obvious limitation of the present study is its open-label
design and absence of a control condition. The initial plan was
to conduct a placebo-controlled RCT but regulatory and drug
procurement challenges meant that available resources could
only support a smaller trial. The present results may be viewed
as a successful demonstration of proof-of-principle, however,
supporting the view that psilocybin can be given safely, even
in severe cases of depression, with the caveat that appropriate
control of context (e.g. the provision of psychological support
and a comfortable environment) is essential for positive out-
comes (Carhart-Harris et al., in review). Impressions of effi-
cacy gleaned from the present study’s findings may be cau-
tiously described as ‘promising’—and if supported by larger

 and better controlled trials, psilocybin’s low toxicity,
favourable side effect profile and putative rapid and enduring
antidepressant action could render it at least competitive with
currently available treatments for major depression, whose
therapeutic actions may be either delayed, e.g. in the cases
of SSRIs and psychotherapy, or short-lived, e.g. in the case
of ketamine. Comparative efficacy trials may therefore be an
interesting next step. Such designs may also have merit in
terms of addressing the challenge of maintaining the study
blind in trials with psychedelics (Carhart-Harris and
Goodwin 2017).
Another limitation of the present trial is that the final eight
patients were all male. This is regretful as it limits extrapola-
tion to the general population, where rates of treatment-
resistant depression may be marginally higher in women than
in men (Kubitz et al. 2013). Greater effort will be made in
future trials to recruit more representative samples of the target
population. Another limitation deserving of mention is the
issue of assessing duration of current depressive episode.
Patients gave estimates based on the question BFor how long
has your current depression lasted?^ but some chose to esti-
mate based on the duration of their chronic illness, believing
they had not experienced a discernable remission for years–
decades, even during periods when their symptoms were rel-
atively less severe.
In summary, we have presented updated and extended data
from a feasibility trial assessing psilocybin with psychological
support for treatment-resistant depression. With the caveat that
this was an open-label trial with no control condition, safety
and efficacy outcomes continue to support the case for further
research (Carhart-Harris and Goodwin 2017). Identifying key
psychological and pharmacological variables comprising the
treatment model, and testing their assumed interactions, is one
of a number of important next steps (Carhart-Harris et al., in
review).
