Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is a critically important therapy
for hematological malignancies, inborn errors of metabolism, and immunodeficiency dis-
orders, yet complications such as graft-vs.-host disease (GvHD) limit survival. Development
of anti-GvHD therapies that do not adversely affect susceptibility to infection or graft-vs.-
tumor immunity are hampered by the lack of a physiologically relevant, preclinical model of
allogeneic HSCT. Here we show a spectrum of diverse clinical HSCT outcomes including
primary and secondary graft failure, lethal GvHD, and stable, disease-free full donor
engraftment using reduced intensity conditioning and mobilized peripheral blood HSCT in
unrelated, fully MHC-matched Mauritian-origin cynomolgus macaques. Anti-GvHD prophy-
laxis of tacrolimus, post-transplant cyclophosphamide, and CD28 blockade induces multi-
lineage, full donor chimerism and recipient-specific tolerance while maintaining pathogen-
specific immunity. These results establish a new preclinical allogeneic HSCT model for
evaluation of GvHD prophylaxis and next-generation HSCT-mediated therapies for solid
organ tolerance, cure of non-malignant hematological disease, and HIV reservoir clearance.

 A
lthough allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplanta-
tion (HSCT) is a foundational treatment capable of
functionally curing malignant and nonmalignant hema-
tological pathologies, severe complications such as graft rejection,
opportunistic infection, organ failure, and graft-vs.-host disease
(GvHD) are frequent. Despite high-resolution MHC-matching
and aggressive immunosuppressive regimens, GvHD is the lead-
ing cause of post-allogeneic HSCT non-relapse morbidity and
mortality1. Approximately 60% of allogeneic HSCT recipients are
estimated to develop GvHD, with survival rates as low as 5% in
patients with advanced grade steroid-refractory acute GvHD2, 3.
Therefore, new immunomodulatory modalities are needed that
selectively limit GvHD while retaining infectious disease immu-
nity and the protective graft-vs.-tumor effect of allogeneic HSCT.
The development of GvHD treatments requires a reproducible
and accurate animal model capable of recapitulating human
physiology and pathology. Large animal HSCT models utilizing
dogs, pigs, or sheep are limited by the availability of species-
specific reagents such as immunophenotyping antibodies. Murine
GvHD models have provided important mechanistic insight into
the development and pathology of the GvHD immune response,
yet direct clinical translation of findings from the mouse model is
often hindered by species-specific differences between murine
and human immune systems, homogenous genetics of inbred
mouse strains, divergent anatomical sources of human and
murine donor cells, and the dysregulated microbiome of mice
raised in pathogen-free housing4, 5. By contrast, given their close
phylogenetic proximity to humans, nonhuman primates (NHP),
such as rhesus and cynomolgus macaques, provide physiologi-
cally relevant models for a range of degenerative, genetic, age-
associated, and infectious human diseases6–8. Indeed, immu-
notherapeutics can directly cross-react with both the human and
macaque targets, allowing rapid translation of new laboratory
discoveries into clinical trials9–11.
Rhesus macaques are an outbred NHP population with
remarkably complex MHC genetics. Each animal expresses up to
twenty MHC-I molecules12, thereby precluding their use as a pre-
clinical model of fully MHC-matched allogeneic HSCT. By con-
trast, Mauritian-origin cynomolgus macaques (MCM), an insular
population that underwent a population bottleneck ~400 years ago,
have only seven fully characterized MHC haplotypes13, 14. Here we
show that fully MHC-matched MCMs can be used for an ideal
preclinical model of allogeneic HSCT, mirroring a range of clinical
outcomes including graft rejection, lethal GvHD, CMV reactivation,
and recipient-specific tolerance during full donor T cell chimerism.
These results establish a new, physiologically relevant model of
fully MHC-matched allogeneic HSCT for addressing critical
challenges in HSCT treatment, such as the development of novel
GvHD prophylactic regimens to disentangle graft-vs.-host and
graft-vs.-tumor immunity, and provide a platform for testing
experimental HSCT applications, such as HSCT-mediated clear-
ance of the latent HIV reservoir.
Results
Engraftment failure in Mauritian cynomolgus macaques. Due
to the complex immunogenetics of rhesus macaques12, previous
NHP allogeneic HSCT experiments have primarily utilized single
MHC haplotype-matched donor-recipient pairs, which invariably
results in either host-mediated graft rejection or donor-mediated
acute lethal GvHD6, 10, 15. Even HSCT between fully MHC-
matched sibling rhesus macaques generated only transient mixed
donor chimerism with minimal T cell engraftment ending with
either graft rejection or lethal infectious disease complications16, 17.
To overcome the limitation posed by rhesus macaque MHC
genetic complexity, we set out to establish an allogeneic HSCT
model based on MCM, a geographically isolated NHP population
with highly limited immunogenetic diversity13,
14. Indeed,
unrelated fully MHC-matched donor-recipient MCM pairs for
allogeneic HSCT could readily be identified (Table 1). To ensure
the clinical relevance of the model, we adopted protocols utilized
in patients at the Oregon Health & Science University Bone
Marrow Transplant Department including a reduced intensity
conditioning (RIC) regimen of busulfan, fludarabine, and low-
dose total body irradiation (TBI), peripheral blood stem cell
mobilization of donors, and GvHD prophylaxis of tacrolimus plus
methotrexate18, 19 (Supplementary Figs. 1 and 2). Following RIC
and fully MHC-matched HSCT, the first recipient, animal 32851,
experienced primary engraftment failure characterized by exten-
ded
leukopenia,
anemia,
and
thrombocytopenia
eventually
necessitating euthanasia (Fig. 1a). No donor chimerism was
detected in whole blood as measured by a DNA surveyor nuclease
assay targeting a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) differing
between donor and recipient (Supplementary Fig. 3). This
primary engraftment failure was likely a consequence of the
sub-optimal CD34+ stem cell dose (Table 1). Leukapheresis
procedures on NHP weighing <10 kg remains a technical
challenge, precluding the routine use of peripheral blood
mobilized stem cells in NHP experiments. To overcome this
obstacle, we optimized the leukapheresis collection parameters
specifically for donor MCM as small as 3.5 kg and performed
multiple procedures per donor, resulting in the ability to

 consistently achieve more optimal CD34+ stem cell doses for all
subsequent HSCT (Supplementary Fig. 2; Table 1).
The next two recipients, 32846 and 32849, underwent the same
RIC regimen described above, but received HSCT containing
higher CD34+ stem cell doses (Table 1; Supplementary Fig. 1).
Donor chimerism was initially detected in the whole blood of
both recipients, as measured by the DNA surveyor nuclease assay,
but in both recipients the donor signal was rapidly lost despite
immunosuppression with tacrolimus and methotrexate (Fig. 1b;
Supplementary Fig. 3). In 32846, the appearance of whole blood
donor chimerism was accompanied by a rebound in the white
blood cell (WBC) and neutrophil counts at day 11 post-
transplant, but donor signal disappeared along with a sharp
decline in WBC at day 14, indicating graft rejection. Indeed, the
WBC and platelets rebounding at day 21 were recipient-derived.
In contrast, the transient donor chimerism in 32849 was not
accompanied by a change in WBC and the recipient immune
system did not rebound, resulting in euthanasia. Because the
DNA surveyor assay is only qualitative, we also utilized
quantitative deep sequencing across SNPs, which confirmed the
transient donor chimerism in blood measured by the DNA
surveyor assay (Fig. 1c; Supplementary Fig. 3). Mixed lymphocyte
reactions (MLR) from 32846 revealed induction of potent donor-
specific T cell immunity post-HSCT, suggesting active host T cell
immune-mediated rejection of the graft (Fig. 1d). Based on these
results,
and the observation that fludarabine incompletely
depletes CD3+ T cells in MCM (Fig. 1a, b), we replaced
fludarabine in the conditioning regimen with a CD3-specific
immunotoxin (CD3-IT) previously shown in NHP to mimic the
lymphocyte depleting activities of anti-thymocyte globulin in
humans20. Despite the ability of CD3-IT to potently reduce CD3
counts in NHP, the variability of NHP CD3 sequences has
precluded wide usage21. However, every MCM examined to date
expresses the highly susceptible CD3 sequence, suggesting CD3-
IT will be universally effective in MCM (Supplementary Fig. 4).
We utilized this new conditioning regimen to perform a second
HSCT in 32846 using the same donor (Table 1; Supplementary
Fig. 1). Despite significant depletion of peripheral CD3+ T cells
by CD3-IT, we observed no donor chimerism and the graft was
again rejected, likely due to strong anti-donor immunity in
residual, tissue-resident recipient T cells (Fig. 1b, d). Thus,
sufficient minor histocompatibility antigens exist between fully
MHC-matched MCMs to lead to immune-mediated rejection of
allogeneic cells.

 Development of lethal GvHD post-HSCT in MCM. Given the
ability of CD3-IT to effectively deplete recipient T cells, we next
explored if the improved CD3-IT-containing RIC regimen might
facilitate
full
engraftment
in
MCM
lacking
donor-specific
immunity. Two HSCT-naive MCMs, 33450 and 33455, received
the CD3-IT, busulfan, and low-dose TBI RIC regimen followed
by fully MHC-matched HSCT (Table 1; Supplementary Fig. 1). In
contrast to previous transplants, whole blood donor chimerism
was present as early as day 1 post-HSCT and detected at every
subsequent time point (Fig. 2a). Both recipients experienced a
massive expansion of WBC and CD3+ T cell counts, and
concomitantly reached full donor chimerism in whole blood
(Fig. 2a, b). At day 12 post-HSCT, 33450 was reported for
extensive hand rubbing and itchy palms, a clinical harbinger of
GvHD. Indeed, despite immunosuppression with methotrexate
and tacrolimus (Supplementary Fig. 5), both animals progressed
rapidly with clinical symptoms of GvHD involving the skin, liver,
and gastrointestinal tract necessitating euthanasia (Fig. 2c; Sup-
plementary Fig. 6). Most striking was the emergence of erythe-
matous rash and exfoliative dermatitis, which upon microscopic
analysis exhibited the GvHD hallmarks of vacuolar interface
dermatitis and necrotic keratinocytes (Fig. 2d; Supplementary
Fig. 7). Importantly, these changes were observed in hair follicles,
excluding interface drug eruption as a potential cause. Both
animals also developed anorexia, weight loss, and diarrhea,
indicating gastrointestinal GvHD. Indeed, histologic features of

 GvHD were present throughout gastrointestinal tract tissues,
including partial to complete destruction of crypts characterized
by high numbers of apoptotic crypt epithelial cells and near-
complete loss of intestinal villi (Supplementary Fig. 7). Inde-
pendent, blinded quantification of the histopathological changes
confirmed extensive GvHD in skin, liver, and gastrointestinal
tract, mirroring the clinical symptoms observed (Fig. 2e). Given
the high level of GvHD pathology, we next measured the level of
donor T cell chimerism and T cell activation within affected
organs such as the liver, colon, and jejunum, as well as in primary
and secondary lymphoid organs. Consistent with the GvHD-
mediated destruction of recipient tissue, the majority of T cells
within affected organs and lymphoid tissues were donor-derived
(Fig. 2f). Furthermore, although both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells
exhibited markers of active proliferation including Ki67, this
activated cell phenotype represented the majority of CD8+
T cells, particularly within GvHD-affected organs (Fig. 2g; Sup-
plementary Fig. 8). In vitro MLR performed at the time of
euthanasia confirmed high-level donor chimerism with anti-
recipient alloreactivity as robust T cell proliferation occurred in
response to pre-HSCT recipient cells, but not donor cells
(Fig. 2h). These results demonstrate that fully MHC-matched
MCM can experience significant post-HSCT GvHD, which is not
controlled by standard human tacrolimus and methotrexate
prophylaxis schedules, indicating the need for more stringent
prophylactic GvHD regimens.
Generation of stable chimeras with full donor engraftment.
Post-transplant cyclophosphamide administration and T cell co-
stimulation blockade are promising GvHD preventative approa-
ches capable of blunting the development of alloreactive T cells
following HSCT22–24. Given the lethal GvHD observed in MCM
recipients treated with tacrolimus and methotrexate, we intensi-
fied our GvHD prophylaxis regimen by replacing methotrexate
with single high-dose post-transplant cyclophosphamide and the
CD28 costimulation-blockade reagent Belatacept (Supplementary
Fig. 1). Two recipients, 33454 and 34666, underwent busulfan,
CD3-IT, and low-dose TBI RIC coupled with antibiotic-mediated
gut decontamination followed by fully MHC-matched HSCT
(Table 1). We detected whole blood donor chimerism in 33454
and 34666 by DNA surveyor assay beginning at days 11 and 14
post-HSCT, respectively, which preceded a rise in WBC, neu-
trophil, and CD3+ T cell counts (Fig. 3a; Supplementary Fig. 9).
Neither animal developed anemia or thrombocytopenia of suffi-
cient severity to require a blood transfusion, indicating the RIC
and GvHD regimen was well tolerated. Remarkably, no clinical
symptoms of GvHD accompanied the rapid donor engraftment,
and both animals were successfully weaned off immunosup-
pression by day 80 post-HSCT (Fig. 3a; Supplementary Figs. 10
and 11). Indeed, both recipients remain clinically stable over 1
year post-HSCT without immunosuppression and show no
clinical, serum chemistry, or hematologic evidence of GvHD.
Quantitative assessment of donor chimerism in peripheral
blood granulocytes and CD3+ T cells revealed that 34666 was
100% donor chimeric in both cellular compartments by day 32
post-HSCT, although a transient decrease in T cell chimerism
occurred before again returning to full donor T cell chimerism at
day 151 post-HSCT (Fig. 3b). Full donor engraftment in both
granulocytes and T cells was subsequently maintained throughout
the remainder of the study. In contrast, 33454 initially achieved
only mixed chimerism, with 100% granulocyte chimerism and
51% T cell donor chimerism in peripheral blood at day 28 post-
HSCT. Because recipients with mixed donor chimerism are at
increased risk of graft rejection and malignant disease relapse,
donor lymphocyte infusions (DLI) are commonly performed to
achieve 100% donor chimerism25. Therefore, we performed a
series of DLIs with escalating doses in 33454. Although an
immediate increase in T cell chimerism followed the first DLI, a
total of three DLI procedures spread over nearly 1 year were
required to reach full T cell donor chimerism (Fig. 3b;
Supplementary Fig. 12). The DLI procedures were well tolerated
and we observed no clinical signs of GvHD due to the infusion of
donor lymphocytes in the absence of immune suppression. The
extent of donor chimerism across immune cell subsets in
peripheral blood and lymphoid tissue mirrored that of the whole
blood values with 100% of all immune cells in 34666 being of
donor origin in both anatomical locations while 33454 exhibited
split donor chimerism with 100% CD8+ T cell chimerism, yet
only 80% donor chimerism in the B-cell compartment in lymph
node (Fig. 3c).
Both
post-transplant
cyclophosphamide
and
CD28
co-stimulation blockade can eliminate the development of
alloreactive T cells and induce T cell anergy10, 23. Given the
durability and extent of donor engraftment without GvHD, we
performed in vitro MLR to assess recipient-specific alloreactive
cellular immune responses. In both 33454 and 34666, the
engrafted T cells exhibited complete tolerance to recipient
antigens (Fig. 3d). However, this immune tolerance towards
recipient cells was not simply the result of a defective immune
system. Following HSCT, CMV reactivation occurred in both
recipients, one of which was treated with short-term valganci-
clovir. CMV viremia was subsequently controlled to undetectable
levels in both recipients in the absence of treatment, and we
detected strong CMV-specific immune responses (Supplementary
Fig. 13). In particular, 33454 developed anti-CMV T cell
responses directed against epitopes not recognized pre-HSCT or
in the stem cell donor. Therefore, post-transplant cyclopho-
sphamide and CD28 costimulation blockade GvHD prophylaxis
is able to induce recipient-specific tolerance while maintaining
infectious disease immunity.
Discussion
Together, these data demonstrate that fully MHC-matched MCM
represent an ideal model of allogeneic HSCT, recapitulating many
clinical outcomes of RIC allogeneic HSCT such as primary and
secondary graft failure, GvHD, mixed donor chimerism with
responsiveness to DLI, CMV reactivation and subsequent control,
and durable full donor multi-lineage chimerism. The establish-
ment of this robust, pre-clinical model will facilitate experiments
across a range of regenerative medicine applications to help
translate new therapies into the clinic. Our studies have revealed
conditions that generate rapid onset graft rejection and GvHD
between fully MHC-matched MCM undergoing allogeneic HSCT,
which can be exploited for subsequent studies. Overall, this minor
antigen alloreactivity mirrors the immune response in patients
receiving HSCT grafts from MHC-matched unrelated and related
donors and thus augurs well for the clinical relevance of this
model. Indeed, a direct extension of the research presented here is
the exploration of novel GvHD prophylaxis regimens such as the
post-transplant cyclophosphamide, belatacept, and tacrolimus
regimen that induced full donor chimerism and recipient-specific
tolerance in fully MHC-matched MCM. Experimental approaches
to limit GvHD through modulation of the T cell content in stem
cell grafts such as depletion of naive cells can also be tested26.
Further, because many human reagents cross-react with macaque
targets, novel investigative GvHD prophylaxis therapeutics can be
directly tested. For example, the Tim-3/Gal-9 and TIGIT negative
checkpoint receptor pathways are implicated in GvHD severity,
and we have previously shown macaque cross-reactivity for
human-specific reagents targeting these pathways27–30.

 The limited, defined MHC genetics of MCM allows for
straightforward selection of donor-recipient pairs exhibiting any
degree of MHC matching desired without the need for specialized
macaque breeding programs. This is especially advantageous for
modeling HSCT-induced tolerance across MHC barriers for solid
organ transplantation. In addition to the ability to select fully
MHC-matched donor-recipient pairs as demonstrated here,
MHC haplotype-mismatched MCM can be used to investigate
approaches such as HLA-haploidentical HSCT treatments being
proposed for patients with aplastic or sickle cell anemia31. Finally,
induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are a promising ther-
apeutic tool for regeneration of damaged tissue and the first
clinical iPSC transplants were recently completed successfully32,
33. However, rejection of fully MHC-matched allogeneic iPSCs
has been documented, and avoiding rejection is a major clinical
goal as banks of human iPSCs are currently being established for
use in allogeneic transplants34. The model described here facil-
itates testing strategies to avoid rejection of transplanted allo-
geneic iPSC without inducing tumors in the recipient.
The use of fully MHC-matched MCMs for allogeneic HSCT
also represents a powerful new tool for identifying mechanisms
leading to HIV reservoir clearance following HSCT. To date there
exists only one documented case of functional HIV cure, which
occurred following an allogeneic HSCT from a CCR5Δ32/Δ32
donor35. Subsequent case studies of HIV+ patients receiving
allogeneic HSCT have led to disappointing results. One patient
underwent myeloablative conditioning and received a graft from
a CCR5Δ32/Δ32 donor, but instead of durable HIV remission post-
HSCT, a CXCR4-tropic HIV emerged and replicated to high
levels resulting in the patient’s death36. In two patients who
underwent RIC and received HSCT from CCR5+/+ donors, cell-
associated HIV DNA could not be found post-HSCT and both
patients initially experienced antiretroviral therapy (ART)-free
HIV remission, yet eventually relapsed with HIV viremia37, 38.
Inherent difficulties in studying HIV cure in patients undergoing
HSCT for cancer such as lack of standardization of ART, immune
conditioning, HSCT source and dose, immune suppression regi-
mens, ethical considerations of ART interruption, and limitations
on tissue sampling of patients hamper research into the
mechanisms involved in purging the latent reservoir. Therefore,
the allogeneic HSCT NHP model described here will accelerate
HIV cure research by facilitating a rigorous and controlled
investigation of the mechanisms of post-HSCT HIV reservoir
clearance. In summary, a new NHP model of fully MHC-matched
allogeneic HSCT now exists to address clinically relevant ques-
tions in transplantation, infectious disease, and beyond for the
betterment of human treatment options.
Methods
Experimental animals. A total of nine male and four female MCMs (Macaca
fascicularis), 4–9 years of age, housed at the ONPRC were utilized for studies under
the approval of the Oregon Health and Science University (OHSU) Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). All macaques in this study were
managed according to the ONPRC animal care program, which is fully accredited
by AAALAC International and is based on the laws, regulations, and guidelines set
forth by the United States Department of Agriculture (e.g., the Animal Welfare Act
and its regulations, and the Animal Care Policy Manual), Institute for Laboratory
Animal Research (e.g., Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, 8th
edition), and the Public Health Service Policy on Humane Care and Use of
Laboratory Animals.
CD3 and MHC typing. Genomic DNA was isolated from 200 μl of whole blood
following the Qiagen DNeasy protocol (Qiagen, cat. no. 69,504) and eluted in 50 μl
buffer AE. CD3ε was amplified in a 25 μl reaction using Phusion Hot Start Flex
(New England Biosciences, cat. no. M0536S), 0.4 μM primers designed to amplify
exon V (5′-ATTTGGGTGGTTCTTTTGTCACTAATTTGC and 5′-GAATGC
CCTTTTGAATGGTCCTCCCTAAAG), and 25 ng genomic DNA. The PCR
conditions were 98 °C 00:30/35 cycles: 98 °C 00:10, 55 °C 00:20, 72 °C 00:30/72 °C
5:00 (used for all molecular work unless stated otherwise). The 370-bp amplicons
were PCR purified using the Nucleospin Gel and PCR cleanup (Macherey-Nagel,
cat. no 740,609.250), Sanger sequenced using the same primers, and analyzed in
Geneious.
For determining the susceptibility of MCM to the FN18-based CD3-IT, PBMC
from 22 MCMs were stained with the following two panels: CD4-APC,
CD8-PB, and Live/Dead Yellow Fixable stain (Invitrogen), and either CD3ε-FITC
clone FN-18, or CD3ε-FITC clone SP34. Samples were washed once with FACS
buffer (PBS with 10% FCS), fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde, and collected on a
Becton Dickinson (BD) LSRII instrument. Analysis was performed using Flow Jo
(Tree Star, Inc.), gating progressively on lymphocytes, singlets, live cells, and
CD3+ cells.
For MHC typing, genomic DNA was isolated as described above. Small
amplicons from exon 2 of MHC class I and MHC class II alleles were amplified in
25 μl reactions using Phusion Hot Start Flex, 0.4 µM primers (MHC I 5′-GCTA
CGTGGACGACACG and 5′-TCGCTCTGGTTGTAGTAGC, MHC II 5′-CGC
TTCGACAGCGAC and 5′-ACTCGCCGCTGCA), and 25–75 ng of genomic DNA
(same PCR conditions as above). The 191 and 169-bp amplicons for class I and
class II, respectively, were gel purified from a 2% agarose gel using the Nucleospin
Gel and PCR cleanup and quantified by NanoDrop 2000 (ThermoFisher Scientific).
In preparation for deep sequencing, amplicons from each animal were pooled
separately with the class I and class II products pooled at a 4:1 ratio, with 200–350
ng DNA per reaction in a final volume of 16 μl dH2O. Samples were barcoded with
the NEXTflex Rapid DNA Sequencing Bundle kit and 6 nt barcodes 1–48 (BIOO
Scientific, cat. no. 5144–03) (AMPure XP beads, Beckman Coulter, cat. no.
A63881) following the protocol with minor modifications: all reagents were used at
half volume, and the final PCR (conditions in step C1) was six cycles. Barcoded
amplicons were quantified with the Qubit dsDNA high-sensitivity kit (Thermo cat.
no. Q32854) on a Qubit 2.0 fluorometer and pooled to 2 nM. The samples were run
on an Illumina Miseq using 2 × 250 paired end reads. Illumina sequence data were
processed using a custom analysis pipeline written by B.N.B. This pipeline has been
made available through DISCVR-Seq (https://github.com/bbimber/discvr-seq), as a
module for LabKey Server, an open-source platform for the management of
scientific data. Briefly, raw reads were trimmed by sequence quality using
Trimmomatic and aligned against a reference library comprised of published MHC
sequences using the aligner MOSAIK, version 2.239–41. Perfect matches between
reads and reference alleles were scored using custom software that utilized HTS-
JDK (http://samtools.github.io/htsjdk/).
Peri-transplantation conditioning and care. The initial Flu-Bu-TBI reduced
intensity conditioning regimen consisted of fludarabine (Flu, 30 mg/m2 IV on day
−4 through day −2, 90 mg/m2 total, manufactured by Ben Venue Laboratories,
Bedford, OH, USA), busulfan (Bu, 4–6 mg/kg IV on day −5, manufactured by
Otsuka America Pharmaceutical, Rockville, MD, USA), and total body irradiation
(TBI, 2–4 Gy delivered at 15–20 cGy/min on day −1 using an Elektra Synergy
System). However, as fludarabine did not induce lymphopenia in MCM, it was
subsequently replaced by CD3-immunotoxin (0.025 mg/kg BID IV on day −6
through day −3, acquired through the NHP Reagent Resource). Details of the
conditioning regimen specific to each recipient are shown in Supplementary Fig. 1.
Peri-transplant care consisted of Cefazolin 25 mg/kg IV BID beginning at day −1
until approximately day +30. Enrofloxacin 10 mg/kg IV SID was administered
when the absolute neutrophil count (ANC) was <1000 cells/μl whole blood and
continued until ANC remained above 1000 cells/μl blood for 48 h. Trimethoprim-
sulfamethoxazole 30 mg/kg PO SID to BID was administered from approximately
day +10 to day +60. Leukoreduced whole blood or packed red blood cells were
transfused when HGB was <6 g/dl or HCT was <20%. Platelet-rich plasma was
transfused when platelet counts were <20,000 cells/μl blood or if signs of coagu-
lopathy were observed on physical examination. All blood product transfusions
were matched according to the ABO blood group antigen system. Some recipients
received G-CSF (Filgrastim or Pegfilgrastim) to enhance donor engraftment. Two
recipients (33454 and 34666) received oral antibiotics (1 × 106 U polymyxin B and
500 mg neomycin sulfate) SID beginning day −6 through day +10 to decontami-
nate the gastrointestinal tract. Details of the peri-transplant care specific to each
recipient are shown in Supplementary Fig. 1. Anti-GvHD prophylaxis consisted of
tacrolimus, initially administered as a continuous IV drip and subsequently given
as an intramuscular (IM) injection SID, with the dose adjusted to maintain a
tacrolimus trough level of 5–15 ng/ml in whole blood (measured by immunoassay,
Abbott Architect i2000). Tacrolimus weaning was achieved by tapering down the
dose by 20% each day over the course of 1 week. Tacrolimus was initially sup-
plemented with Methotrexate (15 mg/m2 on day +1 and 10 mg/m2 on days +3 and
+5 given intravenously). Two recipients with stable donor chimerism (33454 and
34666) received tacrolimus supplemented with post-transplant cyclophosphamide
(40 mg/kg IV on day +3) and Belatacept (20 mg/kg IV on days +4, +7, +10, +14,
+21, and +28, then every 2 weeks until initiation of tapering). On the days of
cyclophosphamide treatment, animals received IV Normosol at ~15–20 ml/kg over
6–8 h to prevent sterile hemorrhagic cystitis. Animal 33455 received methyl-
prednisolone (0.5 mg/kg SID intravenously) beginning at day +7 to treat symptoms
of GvHD. Serum chemistry and complete blood counts were performed 2–3 times
weekly or as clinically indicated. Animals were treated with intravenous fluids and
nephrotoxic drug doses were adjusted as needed when azotemia was detected.
Animals received appropriate supportive care, including analgesics, as clinically

Donor hematopoietic stem cell transplant protocol. MHC-matched donor
macaques received G-CSF (10 μg/kg subcutaneously, SID for five days) to expand
stem cell numbers and AMD3100 (1 mg/kg subcutaneously, 12 h prior to apher-
esis) to mobilize stem cells into the peripheral blood. MCM were sedated with 10
mg/kg ketamine intramuscularly then anesthesia was maintained with isoflurane
throughout the procedure. Following a surgical cut-down to the femoral artery,
femoral arterial catheters (16 gauge, 8-inch intracath) were placed at the femoral
triangle. One intravenous catheter was used as the blood return line from the
leukapheresis machine and the other was used as a blood sampling port. Peripheral
blood cells were then collected via leukapheresis using a Spectra Optia apheresis
system. The Spectra Optia is designed for human donors with no less than 300 ml
total blood volume (TBV). Due to the small size of MCM donors (~3–5 kg with
TBV ~180–300 ml), 120 ml of ABO-matched, leukocyte-reduced priming blood
was first primed through the Spectra Optia to ensure a safe donor hematocrit
throughout the procedure. In addition, for animals below 300 ml TBV the Spectra
Optia must be set to the highest inlet blood:acid citrate dextrose (ACD) ratio to
ensure a sufficient flow rate for blood separation. Therefore, for animals below 300
ml TBV an external syringe pump containing ACD (solution A, Terumo BCT) was
connected to a three-way stop cock directly anterior to the femoral catheter. ACD
was infused into the line at 5 ml/h for the first 30 min of the procedure, followed by
2 ml/h thereafter. Blood samples were taken for iStat analysis every 30 min
throughout the leukapheresis procedure to monitor blood chemistry. Supplemental
calcium (4 mg/ml elemental calcium solution, initial rate of 40–45 ml/h) was
infused intravenously to maintain blood-ionized calcium levels between 1.0 and
1.5 mmol/l. Body temperature was continuously monitored using an esophageal
thermometer and a forced-air warming blanket was used to maintain body tem-
perature. Red blood cells were removed from the leukapheresis product by ficoll
density gradient and mononuclear cells subsequently washed twice in 50 ml PBS.
Stem cells were isolated by staining with CD34-PE (Biolegend, Inc. – clone 561)
and magnetic separation with anti-PE beads (Miltenyi, Inc.). CD34+ stem cell and
CD3+T cell (BD Bioscience – clone SP34-2) frequencies in the positive and
negative sorted fractions were assessed on a Becton Dickinson LSRII. Based on this
data, CD34+ stem cell and CD3+ T cell doses were calculated and final infusion
product was resuspended in 50 ml sterile PBS. Donor grafts were infused at a rate
of 2 ml/min during which time recipient animals were monitored for immunolo-
gical reactions.
Donor chimerism measurement. SNP loci distinguishing donor and recipient
genomes were identified using a custom 128 SNP array designed to genotype
polymorphic loci distributed across the macaque genome adapted from Kanthas-
wamy et al.42. DNA (6.25 ng) from each macaque was enriched for target regions
using TaqMan PreAmp Master Mix in conjunction with a custom TaqMan Pre-
AMP pool, following manufacturer’s recommendations (Life Technologies). Enri-
ched DNAs were diluted 1:10 in 1× TE buffer before being loaded onto OpenArray
chips using the QuantStudio 12K Accufil System and assayed on a QuantStudio
12k Flex Real-Time PCR System (Life Techonologies). The resulting amplification
and allele discrimination plots were visualized with TaqMan Genotyper v1.3
(Applied Biosystems, Inc.) to determine SNP genotypes. Donor engraftment was
measured via two separate donor chimerism assays, a qualitative DNA surveyor
assay performed in real time to inform clinical decisions (shown in Supplementary
Fig. 3), and a post hoc quantitative deep sequencing assay (shown in Supple-
mentary Fig. 3). In some cases, tissue mononuclear cells were sorted for CD45+,
CD3+, or CD33+ cells by Miltenyi sorting prior to extracting genomic DNA for
chimerism assays using APC-conjugated antibodies and anti-APC microbeads. For
each animal, a panel of regions containing SNPs was amplified from genomic
DNA, Sanger sequenced, and analyzed in Geneious (Supplementary Table 1). SNPs
were chosen for donor-recipient pairs if heterozygous for the donor and homo-
zygous for the recipient, or vice versa. To assess early chimerism in real time,
gDNA was isolated from whole blood as stated previously. The appropriate SNP
was amplified from the donor and recipient pre- and post-HSCT using the PCR
conditions listed above. The amplicon was PCR purified and quantified by
NanoDrop. The Surveyor Mutation Detection kit (IDT, cat. no. 706020) protocol
was followed. Briefly, 400 ng of amplicon DNA from each time point in a total of
20 μl dH2O containing 2 ul 10× PCR buffer (ThermoFisher Scientific cat. no.
18067017) was hybridized by annealing slowly from 95 °C to 25 °C in a thermo-
cycler to allow formation of a heteroduplex/homoduplex mixture at the SNP site.
The mixture was treated with 2.5 μl MgCl2, 0.5 μl dH2O, 1 μl Surveyor Nuclease S,
and 1 μl Surveyor Enhancer S and incubated at 42 °C for 35 min. A no-nuclease
control was included. Samples were run on a 2% agarose gel, stained with SybrGold
(Life Technologies), and photographed with a UV imager. Lanes containing SNP-
heterozygous DNA have both a ~220 bp band (homoduplex) and a lower (~110 bp)
band, comprising both halves of the heteroduplex amplicons cleaved by Surveyor
Nuclease S. Lanes containing SNP-homozygous DNA have a single, uncleaved 220
bp band. Post-HSCT, the Surveyor assay can detect chimerism as low as 5%,
though the assay is qualitative. To assess donor chimerism quantitatively post hoc,
the SNP of interest from the recipient was amplified from gDNA from either whole
blood or sorted cells (flow cytometric sorting described below) and prepared for
deep sequencing with NEXTflex Rapid DNA Sequencing Bundle kit as described
above, with the following modifications: 50–75 ng of each amplicon is used per
reaction, in an equimolar ratio to any different SNPs occupying the same barcode.
All reagents were used at one-third the volume and the final PCR (conditions in
step C1) was eight cycles. The samples were run on an Illumina Miseq with a 2 ×
250 kit and analyzed in Geneious. To determine percent chimerism, the calcula-
tions used were (2 × percentage of sequences containing the donor nucleotide) for a
heterozygous donor/homozygous recipient, or 100 − (2 × percentage of sequences
containing the recipient nucleotide) for a homozygous donor/heterozygous reci-
pient, or the percentage of sequences containing the donor nucleotide for homo-
zygous different donor and recipient. Initially, two or three SNPs were utilized and
averaged to determine donor chimerism, but given the consistent accuracy of the
assay, subsequent experiments utilized only one SNP.
CMV monitoring and treatment. Cynomolgus macaque cytomegalovirus
(CyCMV) levels in plasma were monitored via quantitative PCR. Plasma was
concentrated by centrifugation at >20,000 rcf at 4 °C for 1 h, after which super-
natant was removed to leave 200 μl volume. Viral nucleic acid was extracted from
plasma using QIAamp MinElute Virus Spin Kit (Qiagen) according to manu-
facturer’s instructions. Quantitative PCR targeting a 121-bp region of CyCMV43
was carried out in 20 μl reactions by combining 5 μl of extracted viral nucleic acid,
10 μl TaqMan Fast Advanced Master Mix (Life Technologies), 1.5 μl of each 6 μM
primer (forward: 5′-GGGCATTCTCAGGATCACAG-3′; reverse: 5′-TGACACC
AAGAGGGTATGGG-3′), and 2 μl probe (5′-FAM-ACTCTGAAGACCACAAGG
ACCCACG-BHQ-3'). Sample reactions were run in duplicate in MicroAmp Fast
Optical 96-well reaction plates (Applied Biosystems) alongside no template control
reactions and standard reactions containing ten-fold serial dilutions of standard (10
copies to 107 copies per reaction, in duplicate). Plasmid (pCEP4) containing the
121-bp CyCMV target region served as the standard. Plates were run on a Ste-
pOnePlus Real-Time PCR system (Applied Biosystems) with the following con-
ditions: 95 °C 00:20, followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C 00:01, 60 °C 00:20. CyCMV
genome copy number in each sample reaction was calculated according to the
standard curve, and then adjusted for the proportion of viral nucleic acid added to
the reaction (typically 1/6) and initial plasma volume (typically 1 ml) to obtain
CyCMV genome copies per ml plasma. Sample reactions undetectable for CyCMV
by quantitative PCR are reported as 0. When CyCMV levels >500 copies/ml were
identified in plasma, treatment was initiated with 10 mg/kg oral valganciclovir SID,
and subsequently escalated to 10 mg/kg oral valganciclovir BID until levels reached
undetectable levels.
CMV immunity. CMV-specific T cell responses were assessed by interferon-γ
enzyme-linked immunospot assay (IFN-γ ELISPOT) using Monkey IFN-γ ELI-
SPOT Plus ALP kit (Mabtech), following manufacturer’s instructions. ELISPOT
assays were performed in duplicate, stimulating 100,000 peripheral blood mono-
nuclear cells per well with rhesus CMV viral lysate and pools of 15-mer peptides
(11 amino-acid overlap, 7–13 peptides per pool) spanning the RhCMV pp65a,
pp65b, IE-1, and IE-2 proteins (Genbank Accession #AY186194). Negative control
wells were incubated without antigen or with GagORF (pool of 15-mer peptides, 11
amino-acid overlap, spanning the entire SIVmac239 gag protein, Genbank
Accession #M33262); positive control wells were incubated with Concanavalin A
(ConA).
GvHD grading. GvHD was monitored clinically using a previously described
macaque GvHD clinical staging scale10. Briefly, this evaluation consisted of semi-
quantitative individual scores assessing GvHD-mediated abnormalities of skin
(presence and extent of skin rash), liver (extent of alterations in serum bilirubin
levels), gastrointestinal tract (presence and extent of diarrhea), and activity (animal
well-being and behavior). GvHD was also monitored by histopathology using
paraffin-embedded tissues from organs collected at necropsy. Extent of GvHD was
scored on hematoxylin/eosin stained slides by a GvHD histopathology expert
blinded to the clinical history of the animals.
Mixed lymphocyte reaction. Levels of T cell alloreactivity in recipient macaques
were assessed via mixed lymphocyte reactions. Effector cells (PBMC or lymph node
cells) were incubated in 1μM CFSE (Invitrogen) diluted in warm PBS for 10 min at
37 °C, quenched in cold R10 for 5 min, and washed twice with cold R10. CFSE-
labeled effector cells were subsequently combined with lethally irradiated target
cells (PBMC or bone marrow cells derived from donor or recipient pre-HSCT) in
warm R10 in 48-well plates and cultured for 7 days at 37 °C. Effector cells cultured
alone and cultured in Staphylococcus enterotoxin B (Toxin Technologies, Inc.)
served as negative and positive controls, respectively. After 7 days of culture, cells
were harvested, stained for CD3, CD4, and CD8, and viability (Live/Dead Fixable
Yellow, Invitrogen), washed once with FACS buffer, fixed with 2% paraf-
ormaldehyde (PFA), and collected on a BD LSRII instrument. Levels of effector cell
proliferation were assessed by frequency of CFSE-lo cells, gating on live CD3+
singlets.

 Flow cytometric analysis and sorting of immune system cells. Immune subset
frequencies in HSCT recipients were monitored longitudinally by whole blood
staining. EDTA-treated whole blood (50–100 μl) was washed twice with PBS and
stained for CD45, CD3, CD20, CD4, CD8, CD14, CD28, and CD95, and viability
(Live/dead Yellow Fixable, Invitrogen) at room temperature for 30 min. After
staining, whole blood was resuspended in 1 ml FACS Lysing Solution (BD) to lyse
red blood cells and fix remaining cells, incubated at room temperature for 8 min,
washed three times with FACS buffer, and collected on a BD LSRII instrument. All
flow cytometric analysis was performed using Flow Jo (Tree Star, Inc.). T cell
frequency was defined as the percentage of CD20-CD3+ cells within the live CD45
+ singlet population. Mobilized HSCT donor macaques were monitored for stem
cells in peripheral blood by whole blood staining, conducted as described above,
staining for CD45, CD34, and viability (Live/dead Yellow Fixable, Invitrogen).
Stem cell frequency was defined as the percentage of CD34+ cells within the live
CD45+ singlet population. Absolute T cell and stem counts were calculated by
multiplying whole blood staining frequencies by the white blood cell count (WBC),
as determined by complete blood count (CBC) performed on an additional aliquot
of EDTA-treated whole blood.
Levels of T cell proliferation in necropsy tissues were assessed by intracellular
Ki67 staining. Tissues were processed into mononuclear cell preparations, as
previously described44, washed once in PBS, and stained for CD45, CD3, CD20 and
CD8b, and viability (Live/dead Yellow Fixable, Invitrogen) at room temperature for
30 min. Cells were subsequently washed once with FACS buffer, fixed in 2% PFA,
permeabilized with saponin buffer (1× PBS with 0.5% saponin and 10% FBS), and
stained intracellularly for Ki67 overnight at room temperature. The following day,
cells were washed with saponin buffer and collected on a BD LSRII instrument.
Frequencies of Ki67+ T cells were determined within the live, CD45+, CD20−, CD3
+ singlet population, graphing CD8b vs. Ki67 (CD4+ T cells defined as CD8b−).
Frequencies of HLA-DR+ cells were identified in a similar manner, but with HLA-
DR included the surface stain and no subsequent permeabilization.
To assess levels of donor chimerism in specific immune cell subsets, whole
blood cells or lymph node biopsy mononuclear cells were sorted on a BD Aria
instrument. Whole blood was treated with ACK Lysing Solution (Fisher Scientific)
to lyse red blood cells, incubated at 5 min at room temperature, and washed twice
with PBS. ACK-treated whole blood or lymph node mononuclear cells were stained
for 30 min at room temperature and subsequently washed with FACS buffer prior
to sorting. Cells were kept at 4 °C until sorting. For monitoring whole blood T cell
and granulocyte donor chimerism levels, cells were stained for CD3 and CD45, and
for viability in stains using thawed cells. For comprehensive assessment of whole
blood and lymph node immune subset donor chimerism levels, the following
staining panels were used: Panel 1 (T follicular helper cells), CD45, CD3, CD4,
CD95, ICOS or CXCR5, PD-1, Live/dead fixable yellow; Panel 2 (NK, T, B,
monocytes), CD45, CD3, CD14, CD20, CD8, Live/dead fixable yellow; Panel 3
(T cell subsets), CD45, CD3, CD4, CD8, CD28, CD95, Live/dead fixable yellow.
Immune subsets within the live singlets population were defined and sorted as
follows: bulk T cells (CD45-hi, SSC-lo, CD3+), granulocytes (CD45-lo/mid, SSC-
hi), T follicular helper cells (CD45-hi, SSC-lo, CD3+, CD4+, CD95+, PD1-hi, ICOS
+, or CXCR5+), NK cells (CD45-hi, SSC-lo, CD14−, CD20−, CD3−, CD8+), B cells
(CD45-hi, SSC-lo, CD14−, CD20+, CD3−), monocytes (CD45-mid, SSC-mid/high,
CD3−, CD20−, CD14+), bulk CD4+ T cells (CD45-hi, SSC-lo, CD3+, CD4+, CD8
−), and bulk CD8+ T cells (CD45-hi, SSC-lo, CD3+, CD4−, CD8+). Memory T cell
subsets within bulk CD4+ or CD8+ T cell populations were defined and sorted as
follows: naive (CD95−, CD28+), central memory (CD95+, CD28+), and effector
memory (CD95+, CD28−). For each sorted population, 15,000–150,000 cells
(>95% pure) were collected and used for genomic DNA extraction, with the
exception of lymph node T follicular helper cells, NK cells, and effector memory
T cells, for which 4,000–15,000 cells were collected.
