Evidence of care for the ill and injured amongst Neanderthals, inferred through skeletal evidence for
survival from severe illness and injury, is widely accepted. However, healthcare practices have been
viewed primarily as an example of complex cultural behaviour, often discussed alongside symbolism or
mortuary practices. Here we argue that care for the ill and injured is likely to have a long evolutionary
history and to have been highly effective in improving health and reducing mortality risks. Healthcare
provisioning can thus be understood alongside other collaborative ‘risk pooling’ strategies such as
collaborative hunting, food sharing and collaborative parenting. For Neanderthals in particular the se-
lective advantages of healthcare provisioning would have been elevated by a variety of ecological con-
ditions which increased the risk of injury as well their particular behavioural adaptations which affected
the benefits of promoting survival from injury and illness. We argue that healthcare provisioning was not
only a more significant evolutionary adaptation than has previously been acknowledged, but moreover
may also have been essential to Neanderthal occupation at the limits of the North Temperate Zone.

1. Introduction
Cases of apparent care for Neanderthals who were injured or
suffered severe illnesses have been seen as evidence for complex
cultural behaviour in these archaic hominins. However the poten-
tial evolutionary significance of Neanderthal healthcare is often
overlooked.
Here we review evidence for recovery from serious illness and
injury and conclude that Neanderthal healthcare was widespread,
knowledgeable and effective in reducing mortality risk. We argue
that healthcare, from likely short term treatment for minor injuries
and illnesses as well as long term and significant accommodations,
functions to reduce the risks posed by injury and illness. We situate
Neanderthal healthcare within an evolutionary history of care for
the ill and injured as an adaptive practice, and consider how the
particular ecological challenges faced by Neanderthals may explain
pressures to reduce mortality risk from injury through healthcare.
We argue that rather than simply a cultural trait, healthcare can be
seen as part of several adaptations which allowed Neanderthals to
survive in unique environments where they lived alongside large
predatory carnivores and were often dependant on large mammal
biomass as a major food source. Moreover healthcare it may have
been a significant factor in allowing Neanderthals to occupy a
predatory niche which might otherwise have been unavailable to
them.
1.1. Neanderthal healthcare as enigmatic cultural practice
Evidence for remarkable survival of Neanderthals who were ill
or injured has been recovered since as far back as the mid nine-
teenth century. The limited remains of one of the earliest Nean-
derthals discovered, the Feldhofer Neanderthal or ‘Neanderthal 1’
individual, discovered in 1856, demonstrated recovery with likely
care from several injuries and illnesses for example. These included
a severe fracture of the left arm and a healed injury to the frontal
bone as well as continued survival with extensive inflammation of
the paranasal sinuses and metastatic disease (Schultz, 2006). Care
over his lifetime may have included short term intensive care when

 injured, accommodation for a lack of movement in the arm in
foraging for food, as well as probable care for systemic disease prior
to death. He was not alone with many other Neanderthals dis-
playing a range of severe injuries and pathologies before death.
Injuries appear to have been common in these archaic hominins,
and most Neanderthals appear to have suffered from some trau-
matic injury and recovery, often several cases of such (Berger and
Trinkaus, 1995; Trinkaus, 2012). That Neanderthals were capable
of caring for individuals who were ill or injured, from the provi-
sioning of food, water and protection to active treatment for in-
juries, is widely accepted (Hublin, 2009; Thorpe, 2016; Trinkaus
and Villotte, 2017).
Healthcare has however typically been regarded as a complex
cultural practice without an obvious adaptive function. This is at
least in part due to most attention being paid to cases where care
needs must have been extensive, requiring high levels of daily input
over long time scales. Such cases are ‘costly’ in evolutionary terms
as great efforts are made to help someone survive who apparently
could give little back in return, and are seen as good evidence that
the motivations for care from others were ‘uncalculating’ (Spikins
et al., 2018). Perhaps the most famous individual benefitting from
such care, Shanidar I, survived for at least a decade despite a
withered arm, damaged leg, probable blindness in one eye and
probable hearing loss through what is likely to have been daily care
and provisioning from others (Crub�
ezy and Trinkaus, 1992;
Trinkaus and Zimmerman, 1982; Trinkaus, 2014; Trinkaus and
Villotte, 2017). Trinkaus and Shipman comment that ‘A one-
armed, partially blind, crippled man could have made no pretense of
hunting or gathering his own food. That he survived for years after his
trauma was a testament to Neandertal compassion and humanity’
(Trinkaus and Shipman, 1993, 341). Extended periods of interper-
sonal care, despite a lack of any overall economic benefit to such
care, is also clearly evident in other cases such as that of La Chapelle
aux Saints I who suffered from several debilitating conditions,
including severe osteoarthritis and systemic disease (Tilley, 2015a).
Tilley comments ‘it seems unquestionable that during the last months
of LC1's life, at least, the effects of these pathologies, both individually
and in combination, would have constituted loss of independence e
and therefore significant disability e when assessed within the
Neanderthal lifeways context. The extent and impact of his pathologies
suggest that LC1 needed and received health-related care provision to
achieve survival to age at death’ (Tilley, 2015a, 235). Most older
Neanderthals have healed pathologies prompting Trinkaus and
Zimmerman to comment 'that the Neanderthals had achieved a level
of societal development in which disabled individuals were well cared
for by others of the social group. … Several of them, particularly
Shanidar 1 and 3, lived for many years with severely disabling con-
ditions, which would have prevented them from actively contributing
to the subsistence of the local group' (Trinkaus and Zimmerman,
1982, 75).
Given the apparently costly nature of healthcare it is unsur-
prising that care is typically discussed as a somewhat enigmatic
cultural practice, alongside mortuary practices and symbolism.
The significance of healthcare as part of Neanderthal adaptation
remains to be fully explored.
1.2. A broader pattern of widespread cases of recovery, survival and
care
Cases of recovery from severe injury or illness are often dis-
cussed in isolation. However despite a limited skeletal sample a
closer consideration of the pattern of evidence for probable care
reveals many cases in which recovery or survival from pathology
and trauma indicate likely highly effective care from others
(Table 1), distributed throughout the period and spatial extent of
Neanderthal occupation (Fig. 1).
There have been debates over the precise levels of care implied
by recovery in particular cases (for discussion (see Spikins et al.,
2018) however recovery from severe illness or injury aided by
care seems relatively common. As well as other cases, fractures to
the main weight bearing bones of La Ferrassie 1, and La Ferrassie 2
are likely to have entailed care from others to ensure recovery,
whilst a break or sprain of the left foot of Shanidar 3 is also likely to
have entailed support as would the recovery from serious cranial
injuries seen in St Cesaire 1 and Krapina 37. In several cases
healthcare or support is likely to have been long term, with severe
periodontal inflammation likely to have restricted the capacity of
Aubesier 11 and Guattari 1 to forage for themselves, and serious
arm injuries likely to also make foraging (and certainly hunting
activities) difficult for the Feldhofer Neanderthal (Neanderthal 1),
Krapina 180 and La Quina 5 (for further details of these cases see
(Trinkaus and Zimmerman, 1982; Fennell and Trinkaus, 1997;
Zollikofer et al., 2002; Trinkaus et al., 2008a, 2008b; Hublin, 2009;
Estabrook,
2009;
Thorpe, 2016;
Tilley, 2015a; Cunha,
2016;
Trinkaus and Villotte, 2017).
Healthcare also seems likely to have been knowledgeable and
remarkably technically competent in Neanderthals. In the case of La
Chapelle aux Saints 1, for example, care when most debilitated is
likely to have included fever management, hygiene maintenance
and repositioning and manipulation (Tilley, 2015a). Individuals
with systemic diseases (such as La Chapelle aux Saints 1) would
have needed to have been kept hydrated to manage fever, whilst
those with severe wounds and fractures would have required
adequate nutrition and rest. A femoral fracture at the greater
trochanter of La Ferrassie 1 for example would have been painful
and severely restricted mobility requiring care and provisioning
(Fennell and Trinkaus, 1997), as would chronic osteomyelitis of the
hip in La Chapelle aux Saints 1 (Tilley, 2015a). High rates and
healing and low rates of infection suggest that some form of wound
management may have been common (Trinkaus and Zimmerman,
1982, 75). This may have involved using particular dressings and
means of reducing blood loss. The Inuit for example killed lem-
mings to use their skins for dressings wounds and boils, but only
rarely ate lemming meat (Mcelroy et al., 2009, 19). Ochre may
potentially have been used as an antiseptic when applied to
wounds (Zilh~
ao et al., 2010; Velo, 1984). There is also evidence for
use of the use of medicinal plants in dental calculus (Hardy et al.,
2012; Hardy, 2018), including poplar, which contains salicylic acid
and may have been used as a painkiller (Weyrich et al., 2017).
Neanderthals appear to also have been expert collaborative
healthcare providers. Moreover, the visible archaeological evidence
is likely to be the ‘tip of the iceberg’ of more common healthcare
practices, the majority of which remain invisible to archaeological
interpretation.
1.3. Healthcare and differential archaeological visibility
The most archaeologically visible cases of healthcare tend to be
particularly ‘costly’ (in terms of efforts invested from others with
little apparent return) thus skewing our understanding of the
adaptive role of caring for the ill and injured. However what is
visible in the anatomical record poorly represents likely typical
healthcare practices. A well known ‘osteological paradox’ affects
how we make interpretations of health, disease and care from
skeletal material (Bishop, 2011). The skeletal record is biased as to
which individuals are preserved, only certain elements may be
present, and many diseases leave no evidence in bone. However
these biases also specifically act to reduce the apparent adaptive
value of healthcare practices in several ways. Only the most severe
cases of pathology (such as bone trauma and severe degenerative

 diseases) are identified in skeletal material for example, and of
these only the most severe cases can be attributed to probable care
from others with any confidence. Equally many injuries or illnesses
which are life threatening without moderate care leave no palae-
opathological signature in skeletal material. These could include
healthcare that allows rest by provisions of food, water or warmth
or by prevention of deteriorations (e.g. wound cleaning). Costly
cases of care are highly visible archaeologically whilst more com-
mon care for moderate injuries and illness are largely invisible. The
visible archaeological evidence for care is best understood as the
‘tip of the iceberg’ of practices of healthcare which would have been
predominantly low cost, highly effective and adaptive in improving
health and reducing mortality.
A predominance of minor injuries and illnesses and an overall
adaptive value of even modest healthcare practices in modern
contexts illustrate that typical healthcare is likely to have taken the
form of a low cost and highly effective response to minor injury and
illness. The profile care needs in modern wilderness activities is one
in which severe trauma is very rare, and medical attention is
typically focused on sprains and strains, particularly of the lower
body, followed by moderate illnesses such as gastrointestinal
complaints for example (McIntosh et al., 2007) (Fig. 2). Minor

 injuries, such as sprains, strains and lacerations which nonetheless
require rest and treatment are by far the vast majority of injuries
and illnesses which require some form of healthcare in active
outdoor occupations across a range of modern contexts ranging
from general athletics injuries (DeHaven and Lintner, 1986), to
those sustained by paramedics (Maguire et al., 2005) to injuries
seen in big game hunters (Lambrecht and Hargarten, 1993; Reishus,
2007), expeditions in extreme environments (Heggie and Küpper,
2018) or extreme sports such as rodeo riding (Griffin et al., 1987;
Stoneback et al., 2018). 96% of the injuries requiring medical
attention in wilderness activities, mostly through hiking with a
heavy pack, were moderate (such as sprains and minor lacerations)
and only 4% severe, such as fractures (of 633 cases) (Leemon and
Schimelpfenig, 2003). In the anatomical record of injuries recor-
ded in palaeolithic material in contrast (Wu et al., 2011a, 2011b)
almost all would be classed as ‘severe’, taking the form of fractures
and head injuries, whilst far more common and much less serious
pathologies are largely invisible.
A profile of frequent injury and ill health, and predominantly
small scale but effective care for the ill and injured is also typical of
modern hunter-gatherer contexts. Amongst the modern Ache of
Paraguay for example adult males were typically too sick or injured
to hunt on 21% of 470 man days reported, being provisioned or
cared for due to what are mostly moderate illnesses or injuries
(Gurven et al., 2000; Hill and Hurtado, 2009). Pre contact pop-
ulations experienced similar rates of ill health (Hill and Hurtado,
2009). Likewise records illustrate that between 1981 and 1982
men amongst the Efe of the Ituri forest were also ill or injured 21%
of the time (Bailey, 1991). Vulnerable and ill members of modern
hunter-gatherers groups are thus routinely provisioned when in
need, much in the same way as with vulnerable young. Sometimes
runs of ill health requiring provisioning and care to aid recovery can
be lengthy. For the Ache during the same period runs of being
debilitated through ill health lasted at least 30 days in 40% of cases
(Hill and Hurtado, 2009, 3865). 75% of Tsimane adults had been
incapacitated by illness or injury in the past three months (Hill and
Hurtado, 2009, 3865), and 42 of the 49 men in the Arroya Bandera
Ache experienced at least one 90 day period with no meat acqui-
sition in a seven year period, largely due to ill health (Hill and
Hurtado, 2009). Amongst the Shiwiar forager-horticulturalists
around 50% of adults had been incapacitated and unable to forage
for at least a month due to illness or injury and would not have
survived without care from others (Sugiyama, 2001, 2004). Small
investments in care, such as wound cleaning and provisioning
significantly reduce the risk of more severe conditions developing
which might further affect health, whilst moderate investments in
healthcare can play an important role in reducing mortality. Rather
than being costly in adaptive terms, most instances of Neanderthal
healthcare are likely to have been low cost and highly effective in
reducing mortality risk.
Even low cost and short term healthcare practices have impor-
tant evolutionary consequences through altering differential sur-
vival from injury and illness. Healthcare provisioning as an
adaptation may have a long evolutionary history, with simpler
forms of more immediate care in earlier species potentially
providing the basis for the more sustained and knowledgeable care
seen in Neanderthals.
2. Healthcare provisioning in long term evolutionary context
Whilst Neanderthals are the pre-modern human for which we
have the most extensive evidence of healthcare practices, care for
the ill and injured, albeit in simpler forms than those seen in Ne-
anderthals, is recorded in much earlier species, and even in highly
social and collaborative mammals more broadly. Both the behav-
ioural ecology of care for the ill and injured in other species, and
archaeological evidence for healthcare prior to archaic humans
argue for a long term adaptive function to such practices.
2.1. Care for the ill and injured in non-human primates and social
mammals
Whilst care for the ill and injured is often portrayed as uniquely
human, such care is also recorded in both non-human primates and
in social mammals in general. Examples of short term care for ill or
injured peers are seen in non-human primates, particularly apes,
and range from tending wounds (Fabrega,1997; Hart, 2011; Fashing
and Nguyen, 2011) to more complex practices such as birth assis-
tance (Demuru et al., 2018). These behaviours fit within primate
and ape tendencies to respond to distress through consolation as
well as capacities to help in a targeted way (Romero et al., 2010;
Clay and de Waal, 2013; P�
erez-Manrique and Gomila, 2017). Other
mammals also demonstrate care practices. Dolphins will support
an injured group member at the surface to allow them to breathe
for example, and elephants will also protect and lift injured
members of the group (P�
erez-Manrique and Gomila, 2017). It is in
highly social mammals outside of the primate order, and particu-
larly in social carnivores where we see the most widespread evi-
dence of long term care for illness and injury however. Wolves can
provision ill group members by regurgitating food for example
(Barber-Meyer et al., 2016), and in one instance a lioness was
provisioned for eleven months while severely injured (Schaller,
2009; Hart, 2011). Provisioning of the ill and injured and their
survival from what might otherwise have been injuries bringing a
high probability of mortality is recorded in highly social mammals
as diverse as lions, wolves and mongooses (Rasa and Anne, 1983).
Common proximate mechanisms in which mammalian pro-social
responses to infant distress are extended to adult group members
are likely to explain these similarities (Decety et al., 2012, Decety
et
al.,
2016).

 ethological theory give at least one possible explanation for how
instinctive attachment behaviours that promote survival may be
linked to behavioural care-giving systems (see Leedom, 2014).
The most probable evolutionary explanation for apparently
‘selfless’ care of adult group members lies not only in the benefits of
helping relatives but also the selective advantages of reducing the
risk of mortality of other group members in situations where
groups are highly interdependent (Frank and Linsenmair, 2017).
The selective benefits of care for the ill and injured are clearest
where groups consist of close relatives. However where the survival
of any one member is strongly linked to that of the others in the
group caring for those who are injured is still selectively advanta-
geous even without a high degree of genetic relatedness.
Care for the ill or injured in hominins, whilst seen as marking a
distinctive human evolutionary threshold, is in fact not surprising
when considered within this broad comparative evolutionary
context. It has become increasingly clear that collaboration was
essential to early human adaptation for example. From direct
reciprocity common in primates human adaptation becomes
increasingly dependent not only on indirect but also generalised
reciprocity, with reputation for example likely to have played a key
role in social dynamics (Manapat et al., 2013; Jordan et al., 2016;
Steinkopf, 2017). As soon as collaboration became essential for
survival, and individuals within any group highly interdependent,
then selective pressures leading to care for ill and injured group
members are likely to have been increasingly significant, alongside
distinctive social pressures emerging from trust and reputation
(Spikins, 2015, 2012; Steinkopf, 2017). Care for the ill and injured
would thus be expected to have emerged in hominins alongside
other forms of collaboration such as collaborative parenting of
increasingly vulnerable young, collaborative defence from preda-
tors, increased meat eating, food sharing, collaborative hunting and
increased dependence on social learning (Fuentes et al., 2010;
Burkart et al., 2017). Rather than see these adaptations as separate
responses, these different behavioural traits are perhaps best seen
in terms of broader ‘health sharing’, in which risks to health or
energetic costs are expended on behalf of others in the context of
broader evolutionary advantages of proximate acts of altruism
(Marsh, 2016; Hare, 2017).
2.2. Archaeological evidence for care for the ill and injured in early
hominins
Unsurprisingly some of the earliest widely accepted evidence
for care for illness and injury dates to precisely the time at which
major changes in pro-social collaboration appear to be taking place
in human evolution, ie around the emergence of Homo. Examples
include the probable care for a hominin from Dmanisi with tooth
loss and periodontal disease dated to 1.8 million years ago
(Lordkipanidze et al., 2005; Trinkaus and Villotte, 2017), for KNM-
ER 1808, a Homo ergaster with hypervitaminosis A or treponemal
disease (Walker et al., 1982; Skinner, 1991; Doolan, 2011) dated to
around 1.6 million years ago, and for WT1500, a Homo erectus with
juvenile disc herniation dated to 1.6 million years ago (Haeusler
et al., 2013; Schiess et al., 2014). Earlier potential examples of care
have however also been proposed in australopithecines such as a
probable Australopithecus africanus from Sterkfontain in South Af-
rica (Stw 363), dated to around 2e2.5 million years ago with severe
damage to the foot (Pickering and Kramers, 2010; Fisk and Macho,
1992) and an Australopithecus sediba juvenile from Malapa (MH1)
dating to around 2 million years ago with a bony tumour of the
spine which would have limited movement and caused chronic
pain and muscle spasm (Randolph-Quinney et al., 2016).
Care for the ill and injured in early hominins may also have been
under
particular
selection
pressures
unique
to
hominins
themselves, quite apart from more general pressures on pro-social
collaboration seen in other mammals. In comparison to other pri-
mates early hominins would have been unusually vulnerable to
predation as they moved into more predator rich open environ-
ments, whilst lacking evolved defences to this type of predation.
Moreover entering competition for scavenged and hunted food
with other predators would also increase the risk of injury
(Brantingham, 1998). Injuries are well attested in hominins from
the australopithecines onwards, deriving from factors such as falls
(L'Abb�
e et al., 2015), predator attacks (Berger and McGraw, 2007;
Pickering et al., 2004), encounters with prey and competition with
other carnivores (Pickering et al., 2004). A reliance on obligate
bipedalism will have made lower limb injuries a particularly high
mortality risk for early hominins. Furthermore an increasingly
lengthy period of infant dependency will have represented greater
losses of investments if succumbing to mortality through injury or
disease before reaching reproductive age. Added to which a co-
evolution of diseases with healthcare practices might lead to
evolved reliance on healthcare as hominins developed reduced
resilience in the presence of care (Hart, 2011; Kessler et al., 2017).
The particular circumstances affecting the selection pressures
on hominins to reduce the risk of mortality from injury make direct
comparisons with apparently notable independent recovery from
illness and injury in non-human primates problematic (Spikins
et al., 2018). Whilst such comparisons are commonly seen as sug-
gesting that hominins may have survived even remarkable trauma
without care (DeGusta, 2002), non-human primates are able to rely
on a forelimb to replace the function of an injured rear limb to move
around, and able to use a rear limb to replace an injured forelimb
when foraging. In this way injured primates can often forage
independently despite injury even though their foraging efficiency
is reduced, and for this reason injured chimpanzees can often
survive despite injured limbs (Munn, 2006). The case of a one
armed gibbon able to brachiate effectively by using a rear limb as an
‘arm’ (Sayer et al., 2007) is a particular case in point. However as
obligate biped hominins could not replace an injured rear limb with
a forelimb in order to move around effectively, and rear limbs
become far less manipulative and increasingly less helpful as a
replacement for a forelimb particularly given an increased reliance
on tools. Moreover as the diet of early hominins became more
dependent on collaborative scavenging and hunting (Domínguez-
Rodrigo et al., 2014), foraging independently despite injury would
be less viable than it is in other primates, particularly in a context
with high rates of predation. In comparison to non-human primates
hominins would have been more prone to injury, have a higher risk
of mortality from injury and been less able to recover indepen-
dently or find sufficient resources alone.
Increasing dependence on collaborative hunting in later homi-
nins, particularly in unpredictable environments, is likely to have
placed further selective pressures on healthcare as a means of
reducing mortality risks. Care appears to have been common in
Homo heidelbergensis/pre-Neanderthal populations in Europe at
Sima de Los Huesos around 350,000bp for example. Amongst
around 28 individuals interred in a mortuary pit, several provide
evidence for care or accommodation. Craniosyntosis in a young
child which did not adversely affect her care, despite physical
deformity (Gracia et al., 2009) has attracted a certain amount of
attention. This case may not be particularly surprising however as
this condition does not always affect cognition and behaviour, and
care for even extremely disabled infants is known in non-human
primates (Matsumoto et al., 2016). However another individual
suffered from deafness, probably due to infection (P�
erez et al.,1997;
Trinkaus and Villotte, 2017), which is likely to have needed ac-
commodation from others. Perhaps most notably an elderly indi-
vidual is likely to have walked with the aid of a stick, with his

 support likely to have involved a level of planning around his lack of
mobility (Bonmatí et al., 2010, 2011).
Both general pressures common to highly social collaborative
mammals, as well as selective pressures unique to hominins, will
have made healthcare provisioning an increasingly adaptive
response to mortality risks from injury, and in turn healthcare
provisioning will have influenced the ecological niche which
hominins could occupy. Moreover in hominins memory, long term
planning and accumulated knowledge and understanding become
increasingly evident in healthcare, much as in other complex be-
haviours such as collaborative hunting.
In the case of Neanderthals a combination of ecological factors
may have made care particularly essential to survival.
3. The ecological challenges faced by Late Pleistocene
Neanderthals
3.1. Occupying challenging environments in the North Temperate
zone
Neanderthals occupied what was at the time a northernmost
extension of archaic human occupation, being present in Western
Eurasia from approximately 250ka BP (Marra et al., 2017). Securely
dated evidence for Neanderthal occupation stretches as far north as
55� N (Finlayson and Carri�
on, 2007; Slimak et al., 2011; Nielsen
et al., 2017) although highly debated Mousterian assemblages
have been found as far north as near the Arctic Circle at Byzovaya
(Slimak et al., 2011). As descendents of earlier european Homo
heidelbergensis and pre-Neanderthal populations Neanderthals
were not the first hominins to successfully occupy Western Eurasia
but they nonetheless occupied the most northerly regions.
In general ecological terms as environments become cooler,
more seasonal and often more arid with increasing latitude (or
altitude, or effective latitude during glacial phases), survival be-
comes increasingly dependant on abilities to cope with the chal-
lenges imposed by the environment rather than biotic interactions.
Both intra and interspecies competition is affected by this lat-
itudinal gradient (Schemske et al., 2009). Thus survival depends on
managing and mitigating the notable risks which these environ-
ments bring, particularly at the most northerly limits of occupation
and during glaciations where effective latitude (in terms of cold and
aridity) increases. With increasing latitude resources become more
variable seasonally, increasingly patchy and less reliable placing a
challenge on hominin occupation (Pearce et al., 2014). Risks to
mortality and survival come from several different sources. There
are risks to effective reproduction posed by seasonal variations in
the resources needed to support pregnancy and lactation for
example, variable resources leading to potential famines, extremes
of cold which can threaten infant survival, as well as high re-
quirements for mobility to exploit more patchy resources. Depen-
dence on animal food for survival increases with increasing
distance from the equator (Johnson, 2014), and moreover average
prey size increases with cold and increasing latitude (Rodríguez
et al., 2008) bringing elevated risks of injury and mortality
through injury from hunting as well as through competition with
other predators.
Human health, disease and mortality risk in modern ethno-
graphic contexts is strongly correlated with observed changes in
ecology
occurring
with
variations
in
latitude
and
aridity
(Waguespack, 2002; Kelly, 2013, 200). In warmer and more equa-
torial environments the risk of mortality from pathogens as well as
the health effects of pathogen loads are highest, both due the di-
versity of pathogens present and to a greater population density of
hosts and greater possibilities for transmission. Hot and humid
environments
are
particularly
favourable
for
the
spread
of
pathogens which are commonly the primary cause of hunter-
gatherer mortality (Froment, 2001) and continue to influence life
history and development in modern contexts in complex ways
(Magid et al., 2018). As environments become more cold and sea-
sonal with increasing latitude the mortality risk from pathogens
reduces. The risks posed by any possibilities of pathogen trans-
mission from healthcare practices also reduce. However, as risks of
infectious diseases reduce with increasing latitude, mortality risks
from cold, injury and famine rise significantly. For modern Inuit for
example the major risks to mortality come from cold, injury and
famine, with injury deriving not only from hunting and mobility in
difficult terrain but also from the effect which high endurance
demands have on wear and degeneration of bone. Around 50% of
Inuit from northern Alaska, Canada and Greenland, both histori-
cally and in archaeological contexts have spondylitis of the spine
due to fatigue and stress fractures for example (Merbs, 2002).
Moreover hunting accidents caused 15% of the deaths of an
ethnographically
documented
southern
Baffin
Island
group
(Mcelroy et al., 2009) despite complex weaponry. In these cooler
and more arid environments, healthcare practices are more focused
on treating injuries, which both demands more technical knowl-
edge and has greater returns in terms of recovery than the treat-
ment of pathogens and infectious disease. Simply occupying cold
and more arid environments elevated mortality risks from injury
compared to those experienced by the distant ancestors of Nean-
derthals in Africa and Asia.
The highly seasonal, risky and unpredictable nature of Late
Pleistocene environments presented major ecological challenges
for human communities. Palaeoecological evidence documents a
notable instability in European temperatures, with several harsh
climatic events concurring to create a notable deterioration of an
already severe glacial environment (S�
anchez Go~
ni et al., 2002;
Moreno et al., 2014). During the Last Glacial period a series of
Heinrich events, during which large icebergs traversed the North
Atlantic causing global climate cooling, followed by rapid warming
episodes (ie Dansgaard-Oeschger events) caused abrupt alterna-
tions of cold-arid and warm-humid environments. Moreover
extended and independent phases of regional drought with sig-
nificant repercussions on Neanderthal populations have been
documented (Luetscher et al., 2015; Wolf et al., 2018). Climatic and
ecological challenges at less than millennial scale had a substantial
impact on Neanderthal communities during MIS 3, affecting the
availability of food resources, changing distributions of plant and
animal communities, and forcing costly and repeated mobility and
changes in dietary habits (Hodgkins et al., 2016; El Zaatari et al.,
2016). Furthermore there were notable contractions of occupation
from north and east Europe and into a few regions with milder
climates including southerly Mediterranean refugia (Finlayson
et al., 2006; Stewart et al., 2010). There was also a significant
fragmentation
of
Neanderthal
distribution
and
demographic
decline in Europe with frequent regional extinctions (Dennell et al.,
2011;
S�
anchez-Quinto
and
Lalueza-Fox,
2015;
Hublin
and
Roebroeks, 2009; Benito et al., 2017; Wolf et al., 2018) and spo-
radic population replacement (Fabre et al., 2009; Dal�
en et al., 2012;
Melchionna et al., 2018; Hajdinjak et al., 2018). The unreliability of
food resources will have also affected populations in other ways.
Evidence for nutritional stress from enamel hypoplasia amongst
Neanderthals is common and within the upper range of that
observed within modern hunter-gatherers for example (Ogilvie
et al., 1989; Guatelli-Steinberg et al., 2004; Hlusko et al., 2013).
Furthermore contacts between groups may have been limited by
low population density (see Dennell et al., 2011; Bocquet-Appel and
Degioanni, 2013; S�
anchez-Quinto and Lalueza-Fox, 2015; French,
2016; Simons and Sella, 2016; Hajdinjak et al., 2018), driven by
low plant productivity and animal biomass, and the energetic costs

healthcare, Quaternary Science Reviews (2018), https://doi.org/10.1016/j.quascirev.2018.08.011
 of movement across large areas of landscape. Low population
densities and limited contacts also explains low rates of intro-
gression, with half sibling matings being common (Prüfer et al.,
2014; Castellano et al., 2014; Rogers et al., 2017; Harris and
Nielsen, 2016).
Some Neanderthal populations undoubtedly occupied relatively
stable and productive ecological regions, particularly in Mediter-
ranean contexts, however for many this was survival ‘on the edge’.
Although the arrival of anatomically modern humans has been
suggested as one obvious possible factor in eventual Neanderthal
demise (Errico and S�
anchez Go~
ni, 2003; Hortol�
a and Martínez-
Navarro, 2013) and it may have been precisely the challenges
posed by climate and environmental changes which were ulti-
mately the most significant influence (Finlayson et al., 2004;
Stewart, 2007; Müller et al., 2011/2; Melchionna et al., 2018) or at
least a combination of several factors including within them envi-
ronmental and ecological changes (Rey-Rodríguez et al., 2016). The
contemporary extinction of around 35e40% of co-existing mega-
faunal species in particular supports the argument of a primary role
of environment in Neanderthal decline (Stuart and Lister, 2012)
with Neanderthal populations eventually dying out in most of
Europe between 35 and 40 ka BP (Higham et al., 2014; Hublin, 2017)
and ultimately in Iberia (Finlayson et al., 2006).
3.2. Biological and anatomical responses
The effects of selection pressures from challenging environ-
ments on Neanderthal biology and anatomy are well accepted. High
endurance requirements and frequent famines influenced their
body shape, proportions and physiology for example. A similar
body shape to other populations adapted to cold environments has
been noted for some time (Ruff, 1994; Holliday, 1997) and their
facial morphology may also be an adaptation to cold and high en-
ergy demands (Wroe et al., 2018). A large thorax may be an adap-
tation to enhanced physical activity (García-Martínez et al., 2014)
and likewise physiological adaptations to conserve resources
appear to be an adaptation to highly seasonal resource availability
and frequent famine (Vernot and Akey, 2014; Sankararaman et al.,
2016). Furthermore cognitively Neanderthal's large visual cortex
may also be an adaptation to selective pressures on identifying and
hunting animals in conditions of potentially low visibility (Pearce
et al., 2013).
3.3. Adaptive subsistence practices
Neanderthals also adapted their subsistence practices to the
ecological contexts, with Neanderthal diets widely acknowledged
as reflecting their ecological circumstances. Neanderthals occupied
regions with substantial ecological variation in time and space, and
varying their diets accordingly (Fiorenza et al., 2011; El Zaatari et al.,
2016). Though famously characterised as hunters of big game
Neanderthal diets were clearly far more complex and variable.
Plant foods appear to have been exploited as and when available
and are likely to have formed some component of diets throughout
the region occupied (Henry et al., 2011; Power et al., 2018). Coastal
populations would have been able to rely on less risky marine and
intertidal resources, as seen at Gibraltar in the exploitation of
shellfish and seals (Cort�
es-S�
anchez et al., 2011). Fish and birds are
also likely to have been exploited when available (Hardy and
Moncel, 2011). In some Mediterranean regions, particularly in
interglacial periods, it would even have been possible to depend
significantly on plant resources (Salazar-García et al., 2013), and
Neanderthals appear to have particularly flourished in these envi-
ronments (Benito et al., 2017). At El Sidron the dietary profile from
dental calculus suggests that a notable component of plant foods
contributed to Neanderthal diets for example (Weyrich et al., 2017;
Estalrrich et al., 2017). Neanderthals in Mediterranean contexts
provide the only known cases of dental caries due to ingestion of
carbohydrates in the form of plant resources (Walker et al., 2011).
There is however good evidence for a heavy dependence on a
largely meat based diet in most regions alongside behavioural ad-
aptations to a dependence on large mammals for subsistence.
Stable isotope studies (Bocherens et al., 2005; Richards and
Trinkaus, 2009; Naito et al., 2016), molar macrowear (Fiorenza
et al., 2011; El Zaatari et al., 2016; Estalrrich et al., 2017) and
faecal biomarkers (Sistiaga et al., 2014) suggest that Neanderthals
outside of the Mediterranean region depended on a largely meat
based diet. Faunal remains on archaeological sites also suggest a
reliance on large game, which varied according to the ecological
context, with bison, reindeer and horse predominating within
faunal assemblages (Smith, 2015), though Neanderthals also
exploited megafauna in the form of woolly rhinoceros and
mammoth, such as at La Cotte de St Brelade (Scott et al., 2015). They
were clearly well able to adapt to the different opportunities which
large game provided, sometimes hunting individual animals, and at
other times focusing on herds, including the hunting of prime age
individuals. At Jonsac (Niven et al., 2012) and La Pradelles (Rendu
et al., 2012) hunting seems to have focused solely on reindeer for
example.
That the pressures of reliance on meat from large game animals
were a pressing adaptive problem in many regions is clear. Whilst
plant foods and other resources were undoubtedly a component of
diets everywhere, meat as the dominant resource outside of the
Mediterranean region, and probably to the most extreme degree in
late winter and early spring imposes physiological challenges. In
open environments, as recorded at Spy, Neanderthals survived on a
largely carnivorous diet for example (Weyrich et al., 2017;
Estalrrich et al., 2017). A high protein diet can have serious physi-
ological consequences (Hardy, 2010; Hockett, 2012; Fiorenza et al.,
2015) as is clear from palaeopathologies in Inuit populations
(Bishop, 2011) which include anaemia in the context of high con-
sumption of meat (Jamieson and Kuhnlein, 2008). Likewise a
Neanderthal infant from Kiik-Koba appears to have been a victim of
vitamin C deficiency for example (Mednikova, 2017). What plant
materials and fats were available are likely to have been important.
Mammoths may have provided important fat from their brain
material for example (Agam and Barkai, 2016) and Neanderthals
may also have diversified their diet by eating vegetable matter from
the stomachs of their prey (Buck and Stringer, 2014). Selective
pressures to adapt to the strains imposed by a high protein diet has
also been argued to be the explanation for the large lower thorax of
Neanderthals (Ben-Dor et al., 2016).
Individual and group survival clearly depended on capacities to
adapt to notable ecological challenges, and to find ways to reduce
risk, with healthcare practices best seen as part of these wider
patterns of adaptation.
4. Neanderthal healthcare provisioning as adaptation
4.1. Subsistence related mortality risks
Selective pressures to reduce mortality risks through healthcare
provisioning come most obviously from the demands of common
subsistence practices.
Given that most available biomass was in the form of large
herbivores in many regions (Daura et al., 2017) a common reliance
on hunting large game would clearly be an inevitable part of
Neanderthal adaptation in many contexts. Requirements for high
levels of mobility driven by relying on highly dispersed game
(Niven et al., 2012) bring risks of injury in itself, alongside simply

 moving across difficult terrain (such as when hunting ibex, (de los
Terreros et al., 2014; Yravedra and Cobo-S�
anchez, 2015). However it
would have been Neanderthal hunting methods which brought
particular injury risks. Close range hunting with wooden or stone
tipped spears seems to have been the norm given environments in
which ‘running down’ prey through heat exhaustion would not
have been a feasible strategy (Rhodes and Churchill, 2009; Shea and
Sisk, 2010). Hunting of any animal prey is dangerous, however close
encounter hunting of large game demands a high level of collabo-
ration and brings particularly high injury risks (Gaudzinski-
Windheuser et al., 2018). Evidence from characteristic impact
patterns on fallow deer at Neumark-Nord during the Last Inter-
glacial confirms the use of close range spears (Gaudzinski-
Windheuser et al., 2018). A combination of thrusting and close
range throwing seems the most likely hunting technique as Ne-
anderthals would have been physically capable of using thrown
projectiles (Roach et al., 2013). Repeated throwing behaviour is also
the most likely explanation for humeral abnormalities in a Nean-
derthal from Tourville-la-Riviere (Faivre et al., 2014).
Neanderthal's lack of projectile technology has been seen as a
potential adaptive disadvantage (Shea and Sisk, 2010). However,
close encounter hunting, taking advantage of landscape features,
despite the high rates of injury, may simply have been the most
effective hunting method for the faunal communities which Ne-
anderthals exploited. For many of the larger species exploited by
Neanderthals neither long distance spears nor even bow and arrow
technology would have had the kinetic energy required to suffi-
ciently pierce skin and flesh. For larger body size prey hand deliv-
ered spears and use of physiographic features are the typical means
of hunting in modern hunter-gatherer contexts (Churchill, 1993), as
well as many Upper Palaeolithic contexts such as archaic period
bison hunting sites in North America. Close encounter hunting,
using landscape features against which to drive animals explains
patterns of mammoths and woolly rhinoceros exploited by Nean-
derthals at La Cotte de St Brelade (Scott et al., 2015). Neanderthals
also exploited game which were dangerous to exploit in other
ways, such as ibex (Capra ibex) and chamois (Rupicapra rupicapra),
found in particularly difficult terrain (de los Terreros et al., 2014;
Yravedra and Cobo-S�
anchez, 2015).
The elevated injury rates from close range hunting compared
to the use of long range projectiles is evident in ethnographic and
archaeological contexts for example (Churchill, 1993). Amongst
neighbouring prehistoric groups at Point Hope Alaska, the Tigara,
reliant on close encounter hunting of bowhead whale, had twice
the rates of severe injury than the Ipiutak who were reliant on
projectile hunting of caribou (22% vs 12% of skeletal remains
showing traumatic injury) (Dabbs, 2011). The faunal communities
of Late Pleistocene Western Eurasia also brought additional
mortality risks for which we have no modern analogues. The
megafauna present during Neanderthal occupation, including
mammoths
and
woolly
rhinoceros
would
be
particularly
dangerous prey, easily able to overcome an individual human
assailant.
Besides direct confrontations with prey Neanderthals also faced
the presence of large carnivores which in turn were dangerous as
competitors and as predators and for which we have no modern
analogues (Wang et al., 2004). Spotted hyenas (Crocuta crocuta),
cave lions (Panthera spelaea) and cave bears (Ursus spelaeus) would
have been the most common large carnivore threats, due to their
overlapping habitats and prey choices (Ard�
evol and L�
opez, 2009;
Blasco et al., 2010; Dusseldorp, 2011). Dangerous encounters with
leopards (Panthera pardus) and wolves (Canis lupus) seem to have
been less frequent (Camar�
os et al., 2017). Unfortunately, it is not an
easy task to determine from the archaeological record whether the
carnivore damage discovered in several sites are the result of
scavenging activity or from a direct confrontation, but the latter is
reliably recognised in several cases (Fern�
andez-Lomana et al., 2010;
Camar�
os et al., 2016a, Camar�
os et al., 2017). Conflicts with such
predators were extremely dangerous and could lead to death or
severe injuries, as also demonstrated by forensic studies on
current-day carnivore attacks (Camar�
os et al., 2016a). The effects of
carnivore attacks can be significant and in modern contexts are
more likely to lead to mortality in women and children (Treves and
Naughton-Treves, 1999).
Interactions between hominin and large carnivores will have
occurred in a variety of contexts, and across the whole range of
Neanderthal occupation, not only through competition for re-
sources, but also potential occupation sites in caves (Conard, 2011;
Stiner, 2012; Camar�
os et al., 2016b; Camar�
os et al., 2017). Nean-
derthals occupied cave sites also favoured by carnivores, with
faunal accumulations in these locations deriving from both (Ruf�
a
et al., 2017). Cave bears often occupy caves also frequented by
Neanderthals, such as in the Swabian Jura for example (Conard
et al., 2012). Neanderthals may have been unlikely to have been a
chosen prey, with other animals bringing a lower risk of mortality
and it also seems unlikely that large carnivores were hunted to
obtain hides (Camar�
os et al., 2016b) or to produce bone ornaments
and bone tools (Abrams et al., 2014; L. Niven, 2006). Nonetheless
close interactions with large carnivores brought considerable injury
risks (Camar�
os et al., 2016b).
Theoretically at least the distribution and character of injuries
across the skeleton may be a potential source of evidence for the
relative injury risks from different activities. A greater prevalence of
injuries to the head and upper body in Neanderthal skeletal ma-
terial appeared to be similar to that seen in adult rodeo riders and
supported an interpretation of the majority of injuries being sus-
tained through direct engagement with large and dangerous prey
(Berger and Trinkaus, 1995). This interpretation remains debated
however (Trinkaus, 2012). Different physiologies make such com-
parisons difficult, particularly as the injury profile in adolescent
rodeo riding is notably different (Stoneback et al., 2018). Further-
more similar injury profiles also characterise pathologies in skeletal
remains throughout the Pleistocene (Wu et al., 2011a, 2011b) sug-
gesting that differential preservation may be a more likely expla-
nation for this pattern.
The extent to which any particular individuals may have been
protected from the mortality risk imposed through hunting large
game and competing with large carnivores, or indeed differen-
tially exposed to such risks, also remains unresolved. Inexperi-
enced adolescents are likely to have been at particular risk of
injury in close encounter hunting, with their loss particularly
costly in terms of energetic investments against future returns.
Whether Neanderthals had a gender based division of labour also
remains an area of debate (Kuhn et al., 2006; Balme and Bowdler,
2006; Estalrrich and Rosas, 2015). A gender based division of la-
bour exists in modern ethnographic contexts, however this does
not preclude women's hunting and women in many such contexts
are expert hunters, albeit of smaller and less dangerous game than
men (Goodman et al., 1985; Kelly, 2013). However women may
equally have been more involved in hide preparation, as suggested
by dental wear studies (Estalrrich and Rosas, 2015). The reduced
mobility of a pregnant female from Isernia inferred from stron-
tium isotope studies (Lugli et al., 2017) suggests that pregnant
women (perhaps alongside infants and the injured) may have
been protected from the costs of travelling long distances in
search of food resources, and perhaps also mortality risks from
hunting. Nonetheless some involvement of females as well as
males in dangerous hunting has been argued to explain the
limited evidence for similar injuries across both genders (Kuhn
et al., 2006).

 4.2. Mortality risks from interpersonal violence
Further mortality risks may have been driven by interpersonal
violence. Lethal interpersonal violence has been recorded in pre-
Neanderthal populations at Sima de los Huesos where cranium
16 shows evidence of several blunt force trauma blows to the
frontal bone for example (Sala et al., 2015). For Neanderthals
themselves there are two recorded instances of probable inter-
personal violence, one individual from St Cesaire (Zollikofer et al.,
2002) and one from Shanidar (Shanidar 3) (Churchill et al.,
2009b). The former suffered a blunt force head wound (from
which they recovered) and the latter a projectile point injury, most
probably from modern human projectiles, which appear to have led
to death several days later. Interpersonal violence has also been
argued to be the most likely explanation for patterns of cranial
trauma at Krapina (Estabrook and Frayer, 2014) although other
instances of potential interpersonal violence are more ambiguous.
Although patterns of subsistence activity in modern hunter-
gatherers can be relatively predictable from ecological context
their rates of violence are however notoriously variable. Some
hunter-gatherer groups having no recorded cases of interpersonal
violence whilst violence is far more frequent in other contexts (Hill
et al., 2007; Wrangham et al., 2006; Lee, 2014; Lomas, 2009). Thus
there may have been no single pattern over the long period and
large spatial extent of Neanderthal occupation. Moreover very low
population
densities
(Bocquet-Appel
and
Degioanni,
2013;
S�
anchez-Quinto and Lalueza-Fox, 2015) would argue against any
significant territorial aggression (it would be quite simply impos-
sible to ‘police’ a territory and accidental encounters with other
groups would be rare) whilst high genetic relatedness (Prüfer et al.,
2014; Harris and Nielsen, 2016) argues against excessive intragroup
aggression. The contribution which social factors may have made to
injury risks thus remains far less clear than those factors related to
ecology and subsistence.
4.3. The influence of Neanderthal behavioural ecology
A certain ‘ratchet effect’ of increasing dependence on healthcare
driven by Neanderthal behavioural ecology may have also have
come into effect. Most obviously Neanderthal robust body sizes and
high energy requirements (Churchill, 2014) will have placed addi-
tional pressures on ensuring adequate resources through hunting
success. These same high energy requirements will also have
limited group sizes and so increased interdependence, and the
significance of any individual mortality to survival. Evidence from
El Sidron of a group apparently made up of around thirteen in-
dividuals, three related males, four females, three adolescent boys
and three infants is one potentially good example (Lalueza-Fox
et al., 2011). The loss of even one adult hunter in such a circum-
stance may be enough to make any such group vulnerable, whilst
their high relatedness would act to increase the selective advan-
tages of helping others in the group. High levels of relatedness, with
half sibling matings common (Prüfer et al., 2014), also brings with it
other pressures on healthcare provisioning. Low genetic fitness,
caused by high levels of inbreeding (S�
anchez-Quinto and Lalueza-
Fox, 2015; Simons and Sella, 2016) brings higher incidences of
pathologies which are likely to have required care and support
(Dean et al., 2013; Juric et al., 2016; Simons and Sella, 2016).
Whether prion diseases from cannibalistic practices added to the
disease load remains unclear (Mead et al., 2003). Neanderthals may
have become progressively more adapted to a niche in which they
may have depended on healthcare provisioning.
A particular dependence on the high levels of skill and the
technological competence required in acquiring difficult resources
in colder and more seasonal environments (Bamforth and Bleed,
1991; Bleed, 1986) will also have increased the advantages of sur-
vival of older and even partially disabled group members to Ne-
anderthals. Hunting efficiency, and thus resource acquisition,
increases with age in modern hunter-gatherer contexts even where
prey are not particularly dangerous (Walker et al., 2002), and this
‘learning curve’ is likely to have been even steeper for Neander-
thals, particularly where variable environments also adds to the
relative advantage of knowledge built up over long periods. The
knowledge, skills and experience required both in healthcare in
general and in care related to assisting births, and keeping babies
and infants alive in cold conditions should also not be under-
estimated. By extending life expectancies through healthcare
following injuries the group knowledge and experience of how to
deal with many different challenges, particularly in difficult or
unusual circumstances, would have increased. Moreover any
increased dependence on the knowledge of older members with
the greatest life experience would have made care practices all the
more necessary to survival.
Whilst subsistence practices may be the most obvious factor
influencing pressures to manage mortality risks, clearly various
other influences deriving from biological and behavioural adapta-
tions may also have been significant. From the more obvious factors
of hunting large and dangerous mammals and moving through cold
and difficult terrain, to less immediately evident pressures to
maintain skilled hunters in populations and to protect vulnerable
young a combination of factors may have put particularly acute
selection pressures on means of reducing morality risk in Nean-
derthals (see Table 2).
From relatively minor and short term care of sprains, lacera-
tions, minor illnesses or births, to more demanding care for more
severe or long term conditions, we argue that healthcare will have
had a significant impact in allowing Neanderthals to ‘live to fight
another day’ and continue to contribute to group survival. Given
that Neanderthals often lived ‘on the edge’ of viable long term
occupation in many regions their elevated mortality risks may have
been unsustainable without such care.
4.4. The comparative ecological context
Further support from the role of healthcare in reducing mor-
tality risks in Neanderthals comes from a comparative ecological
context. Whilst the ecological significance of mortality risks to
Neanderthal adaptation are rarely considered, it is clear that in
other species reliant on hunting mortality risks are highly signifi-
cant and drive biological and behavioural adaptations. Mortality
risks from injury typically play a significant role in prey choice of
predators in general (Mukherjee and Heithaus, 2013). African wild
dogs can be killed or severely injured by the herbivores which they
hunt for example (Creel and Creel, 2002). Predators such as lions
are not only less efficient foragers when injured but also can be
killed by their competitors (Mukherjee and Heithaus, 2013). Severe
injuries bring a high risk of mortality, and predators will avoid not
only dangerous prey, but habitats which are dangerous, either
because of the risks of being killed by other predators or because of
the risk of injury in moving through complex terrain. Few predators
prey on ibex for example as they reduce their predation risks by
occupying steep shelves and rugged habitats in which predators
run a notable risk of injury (Kotler et al., 1994). Wolves often avoid
dangerous prey, particularly if lacking older animals with necessary
knowledge and skills to avoid injury (MacNulty, 2002; Stahler et al.,
2006), and wolf packs that have lost older members tend to no
longer be able to hunt dangerous prey such as bison or moose
(Dutcher and Dutcher, 2018; Sand et al., 2006). Perhaps most
significantly it is in those packs which hunt dangerous prey, and
rely on accumulated knowledge, that wolves are most likely to

 compensate for mortality risk through injury by caring for and
provisioning the injured (Barber-Meyer et al., 2016). In comparison
hominins are more naturally vulnerable to injury than carnivores,
faced more significant adaptive pressures to improve the survival of
their own injured group members and moreover had a far greater
cognitive capacity to find the means to reduce mortality risks.
5. The implications of healthcare provisioning as an adaptive
response to mortality risks
A strategy of mitigating injury and mortality risk through
healthcare provisioning would explain several previously enig-
matic elements of Neanderthal behaviour.
Most obviously healthcare provisioning explains how Nean-
derthals were able to occupy a predatory niche in competition with
large carnivores from which the risk of mortality from injury would
otherwise have precluded them. Neanderthal's ‘punch above their
weight’ as a predator and they tackle far larger game than
ecological models would suggest should be possible for example
(Dusseldorp, 2012). Moreover recorded injury rates in other pred-
ators are significantly lower and injuries typically less severe than
those seen in Neanderthals. Injury rates in birds of prey (such as
broken toes, talons, flight feathers and injured eyes) vary between
around 6e19%, whilst around 5e10% of large cats have fractured
canines (see Mukherjee and Heithaus, 2013). In contrast almost all
Neanderthals seem to have suffered at least one severe injury, with
many suffering several instances of injury or illness. It even seems
to have been rare to reach adulthood without a significant injury
(Trinkaus and Zimmerman, 1982; Berger and Trinkaus, 1995;
Pettitt, 2000). Nakahashi estimates that the rate of individuals
suffering serious traumatic injury before death may have been as
high as 80e95% of the population (Nakahashi, 2017). Since injury
rates for other predators are limited by a lack of actualistic studies
of injuries occurring in wild populations, and the estimates for
Neanderthal injury are based on a skeletal publication record that
may include selection biases (Estabrook, 2009), and selective
mortuary practices (Spikins et al., 2014), we may be cautious about
using specific estimates. Nonetheless Neanderthals appear to have
used healthcare provisioning to sustain an injury rate which ap-
pears unusually high within a broader evolutionary context.
By surviving after injury Neanderthals will have accumulated
their characteristic pattern of several episodes of severe injury on a
scale which is not recorded in either other predators or in other
primates. It can be difficult to make direct comparisons between
Middle Palaeolithic and modern contexts (Estabrook, 2009), how-
ever modern humans whose environments also impose high rates
of injuries and who provide healthcare similarly reflect this pattern
albeit on a less extreme scale. Lessa for example notes that 27% of
coastal hunter-gather-fishers in pre-colonial contexts in Brazil
showed evidence of severe fractures which had healed, most
commonly caused by falls in difficult coastal terrain, and 11.5% had
multiple instances of fractures (Lessa, 2011). Surviving injuries from
which they might otherwise have died has far reaching effects.
Such survival for example extends the age profile of modern
hunter-gatherers, and preserved knowledge over time, allowing a
third generation to have an influence on the communication of
culture (Hill et al., 2007) and may have had similarly notable effects
on Neanderthals.
Neanderthal's ability to take on more risk than any similar
predator may even explain their apparently daring (or blas�
e) atti-
tudes to tackling prime adults at various sites (White et al., 2016),
whilst other predators by necessity would focus on the weak and
vulnerable.
6. The wider evolutionary significance of healthcare
provisioning
Healthcare provisioning affects the ecology and evolution of
hominins, as perhaps seen most clearly in Neanderthals. It might be
tempting to further conclude that these archaic humans further
displayed some kind of cognitive adaptation to a high risk, high
injury niche. Genes regulating dopamine production, and influ-
encing patterns of risk taking, have been influenced by patterns of
Palaeolithic migration (Chen et al., 1999; Matthews and Butler,
2011) and even historical subsistence practices (Kidd et al., 2014)
for example. However a broader perspective on pro-social behav-
iour would instead suggest that pro-sociality has been integral to
human adaptation from much earlier periods, with substantial
behavioural plasticity of pro-social behaviour according to context
being part of that adaptation (House et al., 2013; Rajhans et al.,
2016). In modern contexts high risk environments increase pro-
pensities to altruism through normal behavioural plasticity ac-
cording to context (Li et al., 2013) as does dependance on
collaborative hunting of very large and dangerous game (eg whale
hunting, (Heinrich et al., 2004). In cognitive terms, Neanderthal's
willingness to care for injured and ill group members most likely
reflects simply that they were humans coping with the particular
challenges that their lifestyles entailed.
The longer evolutionary history of healthcare provisioning is
nonetheless likely to have influenced the path of human evolution
in various different ways (Bastir, 2018). Healthcare can have a direct
effect, such as in the relationship between foetal brain size and

 pelvis shape in Neanderthals, implying a characteristic half turn of a
foetus at birth which is unlikely to have evolved without assisted
births (Le�
on et al., 2008). However even provision of moderate care
can influence the selective advantages and disadvantages of genes
linked to several traits, such as local adaptation of the TRPM8 cold
receptor gene with increasing latitude, which whilst protecting
from effects of cold is also associated with migraine susceptibility
(Key et al., 2018). Care can also have subtle and complex effects of
selection pressures, such as pressures to be pro-social and affiliative
(Hare, 2017), or to express subtle indicators of friendliness and
vulnerability (Godinho et al., 2018). Positive selection for autism
genes may also imply a level of social support for those who bring
additional skills but may need more support (Spikins et al., 2016;
Polimanti and Gelernter, 2017). Healthcare provisioning is likely to
have affected many realms, from anatomy to physiology to cogni-
tion and further research might help us to understand these wider
evolutionary implications of healthcare provisioning both in
Neanderthal populations and beyond.
7. Conclusions
Care for ill and injured group members is likely to have been
part of hominin adaptation since at least the emergence of the
genus Homo. Like food sharing, collaborative defence, collaborative
hunting and collaborative parenting, healthcare provisioning will
have functioned to mitigate risks in highly collaborative and
interdependent groups.
For Neanderthals healthcare provisioning may have been
essential to survival. They will have faced unique ecological chal-
lenges, not only directly from risky and unreliable environments
but also from the injury risks imposed by the need to exploit large
and dangerous game animals in competition with exceptionally
large predators. Particularly high pressures will have been placed
on the means to reduce mortality risk, including through health-
care provisioning. Added to which Neanderthal adaptations,
including high energy requirements, small closely related groups,
and a dependence on skills and knowledge to exploit resources, will
also have elevated the risks from loss of any group members and
the relative benefits of healthcare provisioning. Visible cases of
‘costly’ care in the archaeological record are likely to be the tip of
the iceberg of far more common cases of more minor injuries
requiring care and provisioning to ensure survival.
Few would question that Neanderthal occupation of much of
Western Eurasia was reliant on hunting technology, shelter, fire or
clothing, nor that these populations relied on knowledge, skill and
technological understanding to acquire the large herbivores which
made up much of their diet in most of the regions occupied.
However the implications of reducing mortality risks through
healthcare provisioning has yet to be seen in adaptive terms, even
though Neanderthals will have experienced notable selective
pressures to reduce mortality risk from several causes. Pressures
from predation and hunting in difficult terrain will also have led to
risks of injury and mortality in even the most favourable environ-
ments. However in cooler and more arid environments in particular
pressures on abilities to buffer injury risks through whatever
means, including through healthcare provisioning, will have been
the most intense.
Caring for ill and injured group members is part of being human.
However such healthcare may have been particularly key to making
the injury risks imposed by high mobility, hunting of large game,
and engagements with predators within small groups of robustly
built and closely related archaic humans sustainable. We argue that
healthcare provisioning is a previously unrecognised and signifi-
cant adaptation which improved survival in hominins in general,
influenced human evolution in other realms, and was particularly
significant to the viability of Neanderthal occupation.
