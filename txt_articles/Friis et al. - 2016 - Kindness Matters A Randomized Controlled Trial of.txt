 Kindness Matters: A Randomized
Controlled Trial of a Mindful
Self-Compassion Intervention
Improves Depression, Distress,
and HbA1c Among Patients
With Diabetes
Diabetes Care 2016;39:1963–1971 | DOI: 10.2337/dc16-0416
OBJECTIVE
Mood difficulties are common among patients with diabetes and are linked to
poor blood glucose control and increased complications. Evidence on psycholog-
ical treatments that improve both mood and metabolic outcomes is limited.
Greater self-compassion predicts better mental and physical health in both
healthy and chronically ill populations. Thus, the purpose of this randomized
controlled trial (RCT) was to evaluate the effects of self-compassion training on
mood and metabolic outcomes among patients with diabetes.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
This RCT tested the effects of a standardized 8-week mindful self-compassion
(MSC) program (n = 32) relative to a wait-list control condition (n = 31) among
patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Measures of self-compassion, depressive
symptoms, diabetes-specific distress, and HbA1c were taken at baseline (preinter-
vention), at week 8 (postintervention), and at 3-month follow-up.
RESULTS
Repeated-measures ANOVA using intention to treat showed that MSC training
increased self-compassion and produced statistically and clinically significant re-
ductions in depression and diabetes distress in the intervention group, with re-
sults maintained at 3-month follow-up. MSC participants also averaged a clinically
and statistically meaningful decrease in HbA1c between baseline and follow-up
of >10 mmol/mol (nearly 1%). There were no overall changes for the wait-list
control group.
CONCLUSIONS
This initial report suggests that learning to be kinder to oneself (rather than being
harshly self-critical) may have both emotional and metabolic benefits among
patients with diabetes.

CLIN CARE/EDUCATION/NUTRITION/PSYCHOSOCIAL
 Major depression is estimated to affect
at least 12% of patients with diabetes
(1), with subclinical mood symptoms
and distress apparent in nearly one-third
(31%) of those living with this chronic
condition (2). In addition to predicting a
higher negative affect, the emotional
burden of distress about managing
one’s diabetes may be a qualitatively
different experience from depression
per se (3,4). Although both distress and
depression are linked to poor glycemic
control, evidence suggests that distress
rather than depression may be a better
predictor of metabolic outcomes (3,5).
Of note, given the scale and impact of
mood disturbance among patients with
diabetes, evidence for psychological in-
terventions that successfully treat de-
pression and distress and, ideally,
concurrently improve metabolic out-
comes is limited.
Several reasons exist to continue the
search for psychotherapeutic interven-
tions to improve mental and physical
health outcomes among patients with
diabetes. A meta-analysis of random-
ized controlled trials (RCTs) for treating
depression in diabetes showed that psy-
chotherapeutic treatments are moder-
ately effective for depression and that
cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) in par-
ticular had a small effect on glycemic
control (6). Although the number and
sample sizes of studies included in this
meta-analysis were relatively small
(10 of the 14 studies investigated sam-
ples ranging from 13 to 60 participants),
a more recent study of 87 adults with
depression and uncontrolled type 2 di-
abetes found that CBT focused on ad-
herence and depression improved
these outcomes as well as glycemic con-
trol (7). On the other hand, in their RCT,
Hermanns et al. (8) found that diabetes-
specific CBT reduced depression and
distress in a mixed sample (n = 214) of
patients with type 1 and 2 diabetes but
had no between-group effect on HbA1c,
and a large-scale meta-analysis and re-
view showed no effects of psychological
interventions on glycemic control
among adults with type 1 diabetes
(9). Overall, the wide variation in meth-
odologies and inclusion criteria, includ-
ing the fact that most trials also
included other supportive treatments
such as diabetes education alongside
the intervention, means that drawing
conclusions about the efficacy of current
psychological treatment approaches
and/or their metabolic effects remains
difficult.
Given the prevalence and health-related
implications of mood difficulties among
patients with diabetes and the lack of
conclusive evidence for current psycho-
logical interventions or their effects on
glycemic indices, the search for behav-
ioral interventions that can meet patient
needs on a broad scale must continue.
One promising approach to improving
well-being in clinical settings is the prac-
tice of self-compassion, an ancient idea
arising alongside research into the
health benefits associated with mindful-
ness. Studies of mindfulness interven-
tions among patients with diabetes have
shown consistent improvements in psy-
chological outcomes, including depres-
sion, but effects on metabolic control
have been varied (10). Fundamentally,
self-compassion–based treatments are
based on the notion that significant por-
tions of psychological distress are created
by the tendency to be self-critical about
actual or perceive failures. Self-compassion
incorporates mindfulness as a core com-
ponent (11) while also attempting to
encourage a sense of common hu-
manity (recognizing that everyone goes
through difficult times) and self-kindness
(responding to one’s suffering with gen-
tleness and understanding instead of
judgmentandcriticism).Unlikemindfulness,
self-compassion directly trains the capacity
for active soothing and self-comforting in
times of suffering. Patients learn to treat
themselves in the same way they might
treat distress in a beloved other, provid-
ing gentle comfort and tending to their
own needs for self-care.
For a patient population in which the
relentless demand for healthy blood
glucose control presents daily opportu-
nities for failure and, thus, attacks on
the self, the practice of self-kindness
may reduce psychological suffering
with subsequent, flow-on metabolic be-
nefits. Evidence in both healthy and pa-
tient populations (12) has linked greater
self-kindness with better mood, and a
meta-analysis of nearly 80 studies has
shown a large effect size (r = 0.47)
intherelationshipbetweenself-compassion
and well-being (13). Although evidence
from diabetes is scanty, one study
found that self-compassion predicted
less diabetes-specific distress and
buffered the link between diabetes
distress and poor metabolic out-
comes (5).
Drawing from studies that show
that self-compassion can be increased
through training (14), the current in-
vestigation tested whether an 8-week
group-based self-compassion interven-
tion would improve psychological and
physical health outcomes among pa-
tients with diabetes. We expected that
self-compassion would increase over
the training period and that the training
would reduce both depression and
diabetes-specific distress in the interven-
tionarm.Wealsoexpectedthatthesegains
would be sustained at 3-month follow-up
and that self-compassion training would
reduce HbA1c levels across the same
time period.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
This RCT contrasted a standardized
mindful self-compassion (MSC) inter-
vention with a wait-list (treatment-
as-usual) control. Participants were
63 patients with either type 1 or type 2
diabetes. They were aged 18–70 years
(mean 42.87, SD 14.30), fluent in En-
glish, and able to attend a minimum of
six of eight scheduled treatment ses-
sions. Exclusion criteria were self-
reported inability to read and write
English. Participants were recruited be-
tween July 2014 and September 2014
at three hospital sites in Auckland,
New Zealand. Recruitment was through
self-referral to the trial or following rec-
ommendations from a patient’s physi-
cian or diabetes nurse; the study was
widely advertised through numerous lo-
cal diabetes centers. All participants pro-
vided written informed consent.
Procedure
Participants in the intervention condi-
tion (n = 32) were assessed at baseline
(T1), at week 8 (T2), and 3 months after
training had concluded (T3). Participants
in the wait-list control condition (n = 31)
completed identical measurements at
the same three time points. Each time
they provided data, participants re-
ceived $20 vouchers to cover the costs
associated with traveling to laboratories
for blood testing. Participants received
an additional $20 voucher for each MSC
session they attended to cover transpor-
tation and parking costs. Treatment
groups began in August 2014 and were
completed by October 2014.

Diabetes Care Volume 39, November 2016
 Treatment Allocation
A trained researcher blind to the hy-
potheses and study design and without
participant contact used randomization
software to allocate treatment assign-
ments. Patients were told that they
would be participating in a program
based on evidence that learning to treat
oneself with kindness and understand-
ing when faced with difficult feelings
and circumstances could be good for
mental and physical health. They were
told that they might be allocated to
either a skills training workshop or a
wait-list control. No further information
about the MSC program was provided.
Intervention
MSC is a protocol-standardized inter-
vention aimed at increasing mindfulness
and self-compassion and reducing the
suffering associated with experiential
avoidance (14). Sessions were delivered
to groups of 8–12 people during eight
weekly sessions, each lasting 2.5 h. Ad-
herence to the standard MSC protocol
was strict, without specific reference to
diabetes as a particular source of suffer-
ing. The intervention was delivered
by the first author, a New Zealand–
registered health psychologist trained to
teach the program according to manual-
ized MSC protocols. Clinical supervision
was conducted weekly through Skype
conference with MSC trainers across the
intervention period. All participants
received a standardized e-mail 2 days af-
ter each weekly session that summarized
the week’s teachings and encouraged
them to practice what they had learned
during the previous session.
The central components of MSC are
formal meditation together with formal
and informal self-compassion practices
aimed at developing the cognitive, be-
havioral, and physical capacities to
soothe and comfort oneself when dis-
tressed (see Supplementary Data).
Wait-list Condition
Participants in the wait-list control condi-
tion received medical treatment as usual.
Assessments
Age, sex, ethnicity, and health status
were assessed through self-report, as
were time since diagnosis and type of
diabetes.
Outcome Measures
Self-compassion was assessed using
the Self-Compassion Scale (SCS) (11), a
26-item, 5-point Likert scale question-
naire comprising positive subscales of
self-kindness, common humanity, and
mindfulness and negative subscales of
self-judgment, isolation, and overidenti-
fication. Studies have demonstrated sat-
isfactory psychometric properties (15).
Factor analysis has confirmed the six-factor
structure of the scale and the single higher-
order component of self-compassion. Reli-
abilitiesfortheaggregate total score in the
current study were T1 = 0.91, T2 = 0.91,
and T3 = 0.93.
Depression
Symptoms of major depressive disorder
were assessed with the 9-item Patient
Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) (16). By
using a 2-week time window, responders
rated symptoms on a scale of 1 (not at all)
to 4 (almost every day). A summed score
was calculated. The PHQ-9 is widely used
and has excellent psychometric proper-
ties. It was validated with patients with
diabetes in both primary and specialized
outpatient clinics (17). a-Reliabilities for
the current study are T1 = 0.81, T2 = 0.87,
and T3 = 0.85.
Diabetes-specific distress is a com-
mon condition and is consistently linked
to poor biobehavioral disease manage-
ment (18). The 17-item Diabetes Distress
Scale (DDS) has a consistent factor struc-
ture and good internal reliability and val-
idity (18). The DDS contains items from
four established domains of diabetes-
related distress: emotional burden,
physician-related distress, regimen-related
distress, and interpersonal-related
distress. A total score is calculated,
with a mean item score of $3 consid-
ered to be high distress and worthy of
clinical attention; higher scores on the
DDS have been associated with greater
HbA1c (18). a-Reliabilities for the total
scale are T1 = 0.87, T2 = 0.90, and T3 =
0.92.
Glycemic control (indicated by HbA1c
values at the three time points) was as-
sessed using values reported by Lab Tests
Auckland Ltd., an accredited medical test-
ing laboratory, by using the COBAS Inte-
gra platform (Roche Diagnostics). HbA1c
reflects mean blood glucose levels over
the previous 2–3 months and is the stan-
dard assessment of glycemia (19).
Sample Size Calculation
The sample size calculation, based on 2
(group) 3 3 (time) mixed-model repeated-
measures ANOVA, was estimated from a
review and meta-analysis of psychologi-
cal interventions among patients with di-
abetes (5) in which the effects of
treatment on glycemic control were sub-
stantially smaller than the moderate
effects found for depression. A priori
analyses with an f effect size of 0.25
and a-probability of 0.05 suggested a
minimum sample of 44 participants. Al-
lowing for dropout and retention
(20,21), 63 participants were recruited.
The sample size calculations were per-
formed with GPower 3.1 software.
Statistical Analyses
The Consolidated Standards of Report-
ing Trials (CONSORT) guidelines for
randomized trials were followed, and in-
tention-to-treat analyses were con-
ducted with SPSS Statistics 20 software
(IBM Corporation). Individual missing
values were imputed by using the
means of the relevant subscale for the
SCS and DDS or the total scale mean for
the PHQ-9. For missing HbA1c values (n =
6 of 189), the most recently recorded
value was carried forward. For the four
participants who withdrew from the
study, measurements from the time
point before withdrawal were carried
forward for analysis, and all multivariate
assumptions were met. As a further
check, per-protocol analyses were con-
ducted, revealing a very similar pattern
of results for both biological and sub-
jective outcomes. Independent sam-
ples t tests and x2 analyses were used
to test for possible group differences in
demographic and clinical variables at
baseline (T1).
A series of 2 (group) 3 3 (time) mixed-
model ANOVAs tested the expectations that
1) randomization to the self-compassion
training would increase self-compassion
as well as reduce depression, distress,
and HbA1c relative to the wait-list con-
trol and 2) these gains would be main-
tained at 3-month follow-up. Effect
sizes are reported as partial h2 (hp
2) co-
efficients. To further interpret any time-
by-group interactions, a series of t tests
examined possible differences between
baseline and postintervention (T1 and
T2), between postintervention and
3-month follow-up (T2 and T3), and be-
tween baseline and 3-month follow-up
(T1 and T3).

 between T1 and T3 of 1) at least 5 points
on the baseline PHQ-9 score (22), 2) at
least 1 point on the DDS mean (23), and
3) at least 0.5% (5.5 mmol/mol) in HbA1c
scores (24). x2 analyses were used to
test between-group differences in the
proportion of participants showing clin-
ically significant improvement.
RESULTS
Recruitment and Attrition
As indicated in the CONSORT diagram
(Fig. 1), 84 patients indicated an initial
interest in participation. Of these, 71
were randomized (15% noneligible),
and 63 ultimately provided data for
the study (32 in the MSC condition,
31 in the wait-list control [89% of eli-
gible]). x2 analysis showed no group dif-
ferences in attrition: Of the 63 participants
who provided baseline data, 4 withdrew
(2 from each condition).
Baseline Characteristics
Table 1 provides an overview of the
study sample, stratified by group. No
differences were found between the
two groups at baseline in demographic
or diabetes-specific characteristics
other than time since diagnosis. How-
ever, between-group differences were
seen at baseline on psychological and
clinical metrics; PHQ-9, DDS, and HbA1c
scores were greater and SCS scores were
lower in the MSC group than in the wait-
list control group. A greater proportion
of intervention participants had clinically
significant diabetes distress, but no dif-
ferences between groups were found in
the proportion with clinically significant
depression (Table 2). Because of these
baseline differences, primary analyses
were replicated by ANCOVA in which
baseline values were covaried and T2
and T3 values entered as repeated
measures. Results were essentially
unchanged.
Changes in Self-Compassion
The ANOVA showed a main effect of
time (F[2,60] = 13.07, P , 0.001, hp
2 =
0.30) but not of group (F[1,61] = 0.02,
P . 0.05); however, there was an interac-
tion between time and group (F[2,60] =
0.06, P = 0.001, hp
2 = 0.21). Plot inspec-
tion, confirmed with t tests (Table 3),
showed that self-compassion increased
in the MSC group between T1 and T2,
with gains maintained at T3. No changes
were found in the wait-list control group
at any time (Fig. 2).
Changes in Depressive Symptoms
The ANOVA testing for changes in depres-
sive symptoms showed an effect for
time (F[2,60] = 12.40, P , 0.001, hp
2 =
0.29). As with the SCS scores, there was
no main effect for group (F[1,61] = 2.40,
P . 0.05), but there was a significant
time-by-group interaction (F[2,60] = 7.07,
P , 0.05, hp
2 = 0.19). Plot inspection
confirmed by t tests (Table 3) showed
that the intervention reduced depres-
sion scores in the MSC group between
T1 and T2, with results maintained at T3.
There were no changes in depression
scores in the wait-list control group
between any time point (Fig. 2).
Changes in Diabetes Distress
The ANOVA showed effects for both
time (F[2,60] = 27.30, P , 0.001, hp
2 =
0.48) and group (F[1,61] = 3.92, P = 0.05,
hp
2 = 0.06) as well as an interaction be-
tween time and group (F[2,60] = 12.24,
P , 0.001, hp
2 = 0.29). Plot inspection,
confirmed with t tests (Table 3), showed
that the intervention reduced distress in
the MSC group between T1 and T2, with
improvements maintained at T3. Al-
though there were no changes evident
in the wait-list control group between
T1 and T2, there was an overall reduction
in distress scores between T1 and T3
(Fig. 2).
Changes in HbA1c
Results showed an effect for time
(F[2,60] = 13.25, P , 0.001, hp
2 = 0.31)
but not group (F[1,61] = 2.66, P . 0.05).
The general reduction in HbA1c over
time was qualified by an interaction be-
tween time and group (F[2,60] = 5.1,
P , 0.05, hp
2 = 0.15). Inspection of
the interaction plot, confirmed by
t tests (Table 3), showed that although
HbA1c did not change between T1 and T2
in the MSC group, scores reduced
by .10 mmol/mol (nearly 1%) between
T1 and T3. There was no change overall
between T1 and T3 for the wait-list control
group (Fig. 2).
Clinically Significant Change
Analyses demonstrated group differ-
ences in the proportion of participants
showing clinically meaningful improve-
ment between T1 and T3. In the MSC
group, 20 (62.5%) participants record-
ed a clinically meaningful decrease in
PHQ-9 depression scores compared
with 5 (16.1%) in the wait-list control
group (x2 [1, n = 63] = 12.28, P , 0.001,
w = 20.47). Equally, 15 (46.9%) partici-
pants in the MSC group recorded clini-
cally meaningful reductions in distress
compared with 3 (9.7%) in the wait-list
control group (x2 [1, n = 63] = 8.93, P ,
0.05, w = 20.41). For HbA1c, 21 (65.6%)
participants in the MSC group recorded a
clinically meaningful decrease compared
with 9 (29%) in the wait-list control
group (x2 [1, n = 63] = 7.05, P , 0.05, w =
20.37).
CONCLUSIONS
To our knowledge, this report repre-
sents the first investigation into the pos-
sible utility of self-compassion training
in improving mood and metabolic
outcomes among patients with type 1
and type 2 diabetes. As expected, the
8-week MSC intervention increased
self-compassion, a finding consistent
with a prior RCT of the MSC protocol
and other evidence suggesting that
self-compassion can be learned (14).
The current study extends these findings
to a diabetes population, a difficult-to-
treat patient group among whom
harsh self-criticism is not only com-
mon (25) but also a likely correlate of
mood and behavioral self-management
difficulties. As such, finding that the
intervention showed the expected
benefits in terms of reducing depres-
sion and diabetes-specific distress is
important. Perhaps most notably and
consistent with our final hypothesis,
self-compassion training also reduced
HbA1c, suggesting that the MSC interven-
tion affected both subjective and objec-
tive metrics, an extension of most prior
psychosocial RCTs among patients with
diabetes (26).
Given the absence of compassion-
specific studies among patients with di-
abetes, this discussion considers these
findings in relation to prior studies that
incorporated aspects of mindfulness or
acceptance, a class of psychosocial in-
tervention that may also engender com-
passion alongside acceptance of difficult
thoughts and feelings (4,27). We consider
possible explanations for the benefits of
self-compassion, evaluate the clinical pos-
sibilities for compassion-based therapies
in diabetes, and offer directions for future
research and clinical practice.
First, the finding that the MSC pro-
gram reduced depression adds to the
overall evidence for psychosocial inter-
ventions among patients with diabetes
1966
Self-Compassion Among Patients With Diabetes
Diabetes Care Volume 39, November 2016
 (6–9) and is consistent with several
mindfulness-based RCTs (4,20,21) and
uncontrolled studies (28,29). However,
although mindfulness is a foundation
of MSC, self-compassion is broader in
scope than mindfulness alone, concur-
rently emphasizing self-kindness (rather
than self-criticism) and common hu-
manity (compared with isolation), qual-
ities also associated with well-being
(13). A recent pilot study among breast
cancer survivors (another group in which
mood disorders are common) of an
8-week cognitively based compassion in-
tervention also reported reduced de-
pression after sessions emphasizing
self-kindness and common humanity
(30), providing preliminary evidence for
the efficacy of this type of training.
Second, that the training reduced di-
abetes distress is likewise consistent
with prior mindfulness interventions
(4,20,21). Although diabetes-related
topics were not explicitly referred to
during the MSC program, all participants
were patients with diabetes. As such,
the emphasis on mindful acceptance of
difficulty as being normal (i.e., “other
people in my situation feel like this”)
and active soothing of stressed or un-
comfortable emotional states (“may I
be kind to myself in this moment”) likely
elicited diabetes-related thoughts, with
the MSC practices then proving helpful
in reducing the associated distress. This
interpretation is consistent with the
follow-up due to life
8-week

Friis and Associates
1967
 findings of Gregg et al. (4) in which mind-
fulness and acceptance training reduced
difficult diabetes-related thoughts and
feelings. In contrast, a problem-solving
approach (i.e., attempting to solve the
problems eliciting distress) largely failed
to find between-group differences in dis-
tress (23).
Third, the current finding that the
MSC training resulted in reduced HbA1c
is among a very small number of psycho-
social RCTs to record this critical result
(4,8,9). Although the interaction be-
tween mental health and metabolic out-
comes among patients with diabetes is
complex (9) and the impact of depres-
sion reduction to improve glycemic con-
trol still controversial (31), these results
are consistent with preliminary evi-
dence from studies suggesting that
psychological factors buffer biological
systems from the negative effects of
diabetes distress (5).
One possible explanation for this pat-
tern of benefit is found in data regarding
the physiological and autonomic process-
esbelieved tounderlieself-compassion.It
may be that actively soothing oneself
when distressed reduces stress responses
that are linked to blood glucose levels
(32). Evidence suggests that brief self-
compassion exercises reduce cortisol
(33), and a greater ability to self-soothe
has been linked to greater heart rate var-
iability (34), a measure of autonomic flex-
ibility. Furthermore, cross-sectional data
show that self-compassion is associated
with lower interleukin-6 (35), perhaps
implyingalinkwithinflammatoryprocess-
es that, in turn, are also linked to both
stress (36) and HbA1c (37).
Hence, although the current data are
clearly preliminary and do not directly
illuminate the mechanisms at play,
they are consistent with the notion
that self-compassion deactivates threat
systems (associated with the release of
cortisol and adrenalin) and activates the
mammalian self-soothing system associ-
ated with the release of oxytocin and
opiates (38). Thus, learning to be kinder
to oneself when stress or suffering
arises (i.e., active self-soothing in the
face of stress and difficult emotions)
may be linked to particular physiological
processes that are in themselves linked
to HbA1c.
Study Limitations and Strengths
These contributions noted, the data are
limited in some important ways. First,
the findings are generalizable only to
those who volunteered for the RCT. Al-
though attrition was low for a longitudi-
nal study of this kind (20,21) no formal
analyses of selectivity were possible,
and larger, more representative trials
are warranted.
Second, although participants were
not recruited based on mood problems,
more than one-half (52.38%) reported
clinically significant depression and
nearly one-third (30.16%) reported clin-
ically relevant distress at baseline, rates
notably higher than those reported
among patients with diabetes in general
(20). Consequently, it is possible that
patients with more distress differen-
tially volunteered for the trial and/or
that benefits are more pronounced

Self-Compassion Among Patients With Diabetes
Diabetes Care Volume 39, November 2016
 among people with greater levels of
distress and depression (and poorer gly-
cemic control). In addition, we note a
failure of randomization with between-
group baseline differences in the key
clinical markers of depression, distress,
and HbA1c as well as in self-compassion.
Although the analytic approach should
accommodate such differences, findings
must nonetheless be interpreted with
caution because they may be limited
to those with more room to improve in

 terms of greater baseline levels of de-
pression and distress, among whom
higher HbA1c can be expected (2).
Finally, the absence of an active con-
trol group means nonspecific factors, in-
cluding group support or simply meeting
with a teacher and fellow patients with
diabetes in a supportive way over a pe-
riod of 8 weeks, may be responsible for
the observed effects. Caution must
therefore be applied in attributing these
results to the effects of the MSC inter-
vention specifically, and findings must
again be considered preliminary. Not-
withstanding these limitations, this first
RCTofastand-alonepsychologicalinterven-
tion (i.e., without the inclusion of diabetes-
specific education or material) found
differences in both psychological and
physiological metrics (HbA1c) in what
is a typically hard-to-treat population.
Offsetting these limitations, however,
is a low dropout rate (6.30%), which is
unusual for distressed patients with dia-
betes where levels of ;30% dropout are
common (20,21,39). Participants were
clearly motivated to attend the MSC ses-
sions and to stay involved in the program
until completion. Wait-list control partic-
ipants were also motivated to attend
sessions, with nearly two-thirds subse-
quently taking part in the MSC program
immediately following the conclusion of
the experimental protocol.
Future Directions
Living with diabetes involves relentless
self-care responsibilities that can be
understandably overwhelming for pa-
tients. Opportunities for negative self-
evaluation and self-criticism of failures
in diabetes self-management abound.
Although some evidence exists for the
effectiveness of mindfulness-based inter-
ventions in this patient group, developing
the capacity to actively soothe and
comfort oneself during suffering (i.e.,
self-compassion) may also be useful in
mitigating the harmful effects of self-
criticism. Such benefits might conceivably
extend to other chronically ill populations
in which issues with self-regulation and
mood are common. Randomized trials
with large sample sizes, an active control
group, and longer-term follow-up of both
psychological and metabolic outcomes us-
ing easily replicable protocols are needed.
In summary, these data show that a
standardized, 8-week self-compassion in-
tervention improves both mental health
and metabolic outcomes in patients with
diabetes. The increased capacity to be
kind and understanding to oneself in
the face of difficult feelings may be an
important focus for training as part of
reducing the suffering linked to depres-
sion and distress and improving the key
clinical marker of effective diabetes
management: HbA1c.
