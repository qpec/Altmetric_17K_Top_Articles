Infantile fibrosarcoma (IFS) is a rare pediatric cancer typically pre-
senting in the first 2 years of life. Surgical resection is usually curative
and chemotherapy is active against gross residual disease. However,
when recurrences occur, therapeutic options are limited. We report a
case of refractory IFS with constitutive activation of the tropomyosin-
related kinase (TRK) signaling pathway from an ETS variant gene
6–neurotrophin 3 receptor gene (ETV6–NTRK3) gene fusion. The
patient enrolled in a pediatric Phase 1 trial of LOXO-101, an exper-
imental, highly selective inhibitor of TRK. The patient experienced a
rapid, radiographic response, demonstrating the potential for LOXO-
101 to provide benefit for IFS harboring NTRK gene fusions. Pedi-

INTRODUCTION
Infantile
fibrosarcoma
(IFS)
is
a
rare
myofibroblas-
tic/fibroblastic tumor, often arising in the extremities, that
most commonly affects patients in the first 2 years of life.[1]
Despite similarities with adult-type fibrosarcoma, pediatric
IFS has a more favorable clinical course and is nearly always
characterized by a t(12;15)(p13;q25) translocation.[2–4] This
translocation fuses the ETS variant gene 6 (ETV6) in chromo-
some 12 with the neurotrophin 3 receptor gene (NTRK3) kinase
domain, resulting in activation of multiple signaling cascades
including the ras protein (RAS) and phosphatidylinositol
3-kinase–protein kinase B (PI3K–AKT) pathways.[5] Although
surgery and chemotherapy can be very effective in treating this
disease, a small number of patients develop chemorefractory
disease and ultimately die from local or distant complications
of their disease.[3,4]
LOXO-101 is an ATP-competitive oral inhibitor of the
tropomyosin-related kinase (TRK) family of receptor kinases
(TRKA, B, and C), with low nanomolar 50% inhibitory con-
centrations against all three isoforms, and 1,000-fold or greater
selectivity relative to other kinases. Previous work has demon-
strated the preclinical activity of LOXO-101 in a cell line model,
which harbors an ETV6–NTRK3 fusion.[6]
In this case study, we report the first pediatric patient with
IFS and an ETV6–NTRK3 fusion treated with a selective TRK
inhibitor, LOXO-101.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
A multicenter pediatric phase 1 dose-escalation study in pa-
tients with advanced solid or primary central nervous system
tumors was initiated in December 2015 (ClinicalTrials.gov Iden-
tifier: NCT02637687) to evaluate the safety and tolerability of
LOXO-101. Eligibility criteria included the age of 1–21 years
regardless of the presence of a known TRK alteration, as well
as those patients aged 1 month of age or greater with a known
NTRK fusion and a diagnosis of IFS or congential mesoblastic
nephroma. An oral liquid formulation of LOXO-101 was devel-
oped for patients unable to swallow capsules. Simcyp R
� Pediatric
Simulation modeling (CERTARA, Princeton, NJ) was utilized
to establish a pharmacokinetic approach for dosing that takes
into account patient age, ontogeny of the clearance pathways
that eliminate LOXO-101, and body surface area. The pediatric
dose selected for the initial cohort was predicted to equal the ex-
posure achieved in adult patients taking a dose of 100 mg twice a
day, the recommended Phase 2 adult dose. Cycles are measured
in 28-day increments with continuous dosing. Response assess-
ments by appropriate imaging modalities are scheduled every 8
weeks. Patients continue on therapy until evidence of disease
progression or intolerable toxicity.
RESULTS
An otherwise healthy female was born with a large, vascular,
right-sided neck mass extending to the face that was initially
diagnosed and treated as a rapidly involuting congenital heman-
gioma. At 6 months of age, the mass grew rapidly and surgical

 LOXO-101 Treatment of NTRK3–ETV6 Fusion in Patient With IFS

excision/debulking revealed the diagnosis of IFS confirmed
by an ETV6 translocation by FISH. Within the first 7 days
postoperatively, the tumor rapidly progressed, encroaching the
oral cavity. Chemotherapy with vincristine, actinomycin-D, and
cyclophosphamide was initiated but the patient experienced
disease progression during cycle 1. A new chemotherapy regi-
men composed of ifosfamide and doxorubicin (ID) was started
concurrently with debulking surgery and a tracheostomy was
performed for oropharyngeal obstruction. Two additional
courses of ID and four courses of ifosfamide and etoposide had
minimal impact on the tumor. The tumor progressed to involve
the base of the skull, mastoids, and cervical vasculature. Gross
surgical resection was performed in October 2015 by a team of
multidisciplinary surgeons but clear surgical margins could not
be achieved.
Five weeks following surgical resection, magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) of the brain and neck showed a 20 mm × 19
mm × 18 mm hyperenhancing mass involving the skull base
of the middle cranial fossa, just anterior and inferior to the in-
ner ear structures (Figs. 1A and 1B). Further chemotherapy was
determined to be futile due to lack of response to all standard
regimens. Repeat surgical resection was deemed not possible.
Therapeutic radiotherapy was possible, but based on the age
of the patient and location of the disease, it was expected to
produce devastating long-term sequelae.
In December 2015, at the age of 16 months, the patient
enrolled in the Phase 1 pediatric study of the oral, selective
TRK inhibitor LOXO-101. The parents noted improved engage-
ment and playfulness throughout Cycle 1. At the end of cycle 1
(day 28), an MRI of the brain and neck showed a significant
interval reduction in the size and enhancement of the mass
by more than 90% from baseline (Figs. 1C and 1D). Repeat
scans at the end of Cycle 2 confirmed the size reduction and
showed continued decrease in enhancement, confirming par-
tial response (Figs. 1E and 1F). During the preparation of this
manuscript, the patient remained under observation in Cycle 5
of dosing with a confirmed partial response by RECIST.[7] Dur-
ing the first two cycles, the patient experienced fever and PCR-
confirmed influenza A (considered not related) but no adverse
events related to LOXO-101.
DISCUSSION
We report a pediatric patient with refractory IFS with a
confirmed ETV6–NTRK3 fusion that responded to LOXO-
101, a highly selective pan-TRK inhibitor currently in clinical
development. Cancers with chromosomal translocation that re-
sult in fusion kinases have historically demonstrated oncogene
addiction behavior and dramatic responses to relevant drug in-
hibitors.[8,9] Fusion kinases involving Abelson murine leukemia
viral oncogene homolog 1 (ABL), anaplastic lymphoma kinase
(ALK), and ROS proto-oncogene 1 (ROS1) have identified pop-
ulations that benefit from targeted drugs that are approved by
U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The development of these
inhibitors for other fusions and specifically for pediatric patients
has likely lagged behind adult development because of the lim-
ited availability of comprehensive genomic profiling of rare pe-
diatric tumors and the generally favorable outcomes of pediatric
cancer patients with conventional modalities such as surgery and
cytotoxic chemotherapy.

Since 1998, IFS,[10] cellular subtype congenital mesoblastic
nephroma,[11] and secretory breast cancer [12] have all been
shown to harbor the ETV6–NTRK3 fusion. Since the main-
stream adoption of next-generation sequencing tools, a grow-
ing body of literature has supported the hypothesis that NTRK
fusions cause tumorigenesis through the constitutive activa-
tion of downstream growth and proliferative pathways.[6,13]
NTRK fusions have been recently reported in a variety of pedi-
atric oncologic diseases such as diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma
and nonbrainstem high-grade gliomas,[14] pediatric papillary
thyroid cancer,[15] spitzoid melanoma,[16] Ph-like acute lym-
phoblastic leukemia,[17] undifferentiated sarcoma,[18] soft tis-
sue schwannoma,[6] and spindle cell sarcomas.[19]

Nagasubramanian et al.
While the majority of patients with IFS have an ETV6–
NTRK3 fusion and are responsive to surgery and/or chemother-
apy, a small number of patients are unusually difficult to treat.[4]
Wong and colleagues have recently described a case of an ETV6–
NTRK3 fusion negative and chemotherapy-refractive IFS found
to harbor a lamin a/c–neurotrophic tyrosine kinase receptor
type 1 (LMNA–NTRK1) gene fusion.[20] These two cases serve
as helpful reminders that genomic profiling can aid in the mor-
phologic diagnosis of selected pediatric sarcomas, and that ac-
tionable, therapeutically useful information may emerge from a
molecular diagnosis. As Hong and colleagues have previously
shown, a TRK-targeted therapy such as LOXO-101 seems to
have efficacy without regard to histologic diagnosis or fusion
construct partners.[21]
The radiologic tumor regression and clinical response seen in
this patient with an ETV6–NTRK3 fusion positive IFS provide
further clinical validation not only of this molecular target in
oncology but also for NTRK fusions as drivers of clinical dis-
ease. This case report supports the clinical development of se-
lective TRK inhibitors such as LOXO-101 in pediatric patients
with an NTRK fusion. This case report underscores the poten-
tial promise of targeted therapies in pediatric populations when
compelling oncogenic drivers can be identified and potent inves-
tigational inhibitors are available. Their role in the neoadjuvant,
adjuvant, and metastatic settings as well as safety in inhibiting
TRK in infants deserves further clinical investigation.
