Abstract
The highly acidic gastric environment creates a physiological barrier for using therapeutic drugs in 
the stomach. While proton pump inhibitors have been widely used for blocking acid-producing 
enzymes, this approach can cause various adverse effects. Herein, we report on a new microdevice, 
consisting of magnesium-based micromotors that can autonomously and temporally neutralize 
gastric acid through efficient chemical propulsion in the gastric fluid by rapidly depleting the 
localized protons. Coating these micromotors with a cargo-containing pH-responsive polymer 
layer leads to autonomous release of the encapsulated payload upon gastric-acid neutralization by 
the motors. Testing in a mouse model, the in vivo results demonstrate that these motors can safely 
and rapidly neutralize gastric acid and simultaneously release payload without causing noticeable 
acute toxicity or affecting the stomach function, with the normal stomach pH restored within 24 h 
post motor administration.

Gastric acid, consisting primarily of hydrochloric acid produced by parietal cells in the 
gastric glands, plays a crucial role in maintaining the stomach’s digestive function. It enables 
gastric proteolysis by denaturing proteins from food for break down by digestive enzymes. It 
also inhibits the growth of many microorganisms that enter the stomach and thus reduces the 
risk of pathogen infection. However, the harsh gastric environment becomes a double-edged 
sword at certain circumstances. For example, it creates a physiological barrier for the use 
and delivery of therapeutic drugs, such as protein-based drugs and some antibiotics in the 
stomach. In these cases, the drugs are exclusively combined with a proton pump inhibitor 
(PPI), which reduces the production of gastric acid. The effectiveness of PPI is attributed to 
the irreversible binding to the proton pumps to suppress acid secretion for approximately 12 
to 24 hours.[1,2] Long-term use of PPI can cause adverse effects such as headache, diarrhea 
and fatigue, and in more serious scenarios cause anxiety and depression, as well as server 
reaction rhabdomyolysis.[3–8] Therefore, it would be highly desirable to develop alternative 
approaches that can temperately neutralize gastric acid while not causing adverse drug 
effect.
Recent advances in nanotechnology has led to the design of a variety of nanocarrier systems 
that can respond to various biological stimuli such as pH for triggered release of their 
payload.[9–12] In particular, the emerging synthetic nano/micromotors which are tiny devices 
that convert locally supplied fuels or externally provided energy to force and 
movement,[13–22] have shown considerable promise as delivery vehicles because of their 
active transport capacity and ability to dynamically respond to their surroundings.[23–30] For 
example, recent in vivo evaluations of synthetic micromotors demonstrated that these 
artificial motors can self-propel in the stomach and intestinal fluids for enhanced retention 
and targeted delivery in the gastrointestinal tract.[31,32] These prior studies demonstrate that 
the motor-based active transport systems offer attractive features for localized targeted 
delivery.

 In this work, we introduce a new magnesium (Mg)-based micromotor, covered by a pH 
sensitive polymer coating, which can rapidly yet transiently neutralize the acidity of the 
stomach fluid in vitro and in vivo. By using acid as fuel, these synthetic motors rapidly 
deplete protons while propelling in the stomach, which can effectively elevate the gastric pH 
to neutral in less than 20 min from the motors are applied. More importantly, the motor-
induced neutralization of the stomach fluid further triggers the autonomous payload release 
from the pH-sensitive polymer coating. In contrast to acid suppression by PPIs, the 
micromotors temporally alter the local environment, without blocking the function of the 
proton pumps. Therefore, this approach has minimal interference upon the function of the 
stomach and completely eliminates all possible adverse effects associated with conventional 
PPIs. Since the micromotors are made of biocompatible materials without biological 
activities, they are safe to use and will not cause acute toxicity. Compared to conventional 
pH-responsive nanocarriers that passively respond to the local environment, these 
micromotors can actively adjust their surroundings to reach desired conditions for triggered 
payload release. Therefore, the use of micromotors, with built-in dual capabilities of acid 
neutralization and pH-responsive payload release, is a unique and highly promising platform 
for drug delivery to treat various gastric diseases.
Figure 1a schematically illustrates the structure of a Mg-based micromotor along with its 
gastric acid neutralization process (through proton depletion enabled by the micromotor 
reaction and propulsion) and consequent payload release from the pH-responsive polymer 
coating. The new microvehicle thus consists of the Mg motor, the pH-sensitive polymer 
coating, and the encapsulated cargo. It offers multiple capabilities and functions including 
movement, acid neutralization, cargo transport and release. The Mg engine converts the acid 
fuel to propulsion force and simultaneously alters the local pH that causes payload release 
from the pH-sensitive coating. The core of the micromotor is made of a Mg microsphere 
with a diameter of ~20 μm. For the fabrication of the micromotors, a layer of Mg 
microparticles was dispersed onto a glass slide, followed by an asymmetrical coating of the 
microspheres by sputtering with a thin (10 nm) gold (Au) layer, which is responsible for 
efficient propulsion through the macrogalvanic corrosion of the Mg surface.[33] After 
sputtering the Au layer, the Janus microspheres were coated with a pH-sensitive polymeric 
(EUDRAGIT® L100-55, dissolves at pH > 5.5) film containing the payload. Finally, the 
well-separated Mg Janus micromotors were obtained after soft mechanical scratching of the 
glass slide, leaving a small opening that exposes the Mg surface to reaction with the gastric 
fluid that leads to the hydrogen-bubble generation and propulsion. The presented 
micromotor design is highly bio-compatible, as magnesium is an essential mineral needed 
for variety of physiological functions.[34] The enteric polymer coating has been extensively 
used for drug delivery and release,[32] while gold is commonly employed for imaging and 
therapeutic applications.[35] The bottom section of Figure 1a illustrates the in vivo acid 
neutralization process associated with the propulsion of the Mg-based Janus micromotors 
along with the corresponding payload release from the pH-sensitive polymer layer. Upon 
contact with the gastric fluid, a spontaneous reaction between the Mg microsphere motor 
surface and the surrounding protons (displayed in top left part of Figure 1a), generates 
hydrogen bubbles, and efficient micromotor thrust. Such reaction and acid neutralization are

 facilitated by the presence of the Au layer, which boosts proton depletion through 
macrogalvanic corrosion.
Figure 1b shows the characterization of the Mg-based Janus micromotors. The scanning 
electron microscopy (SEM) image shows a small opening (~2 μm) presented on the 
spherical Mg-based micromotor, produced during the coating process of the micromotors, to 
expose the Mg surface for reaction with the surrounding acid fluid. The presence of Mg, Au, 
and carbon (from the polymer coating) is also confirmed by the corresponding energy-
dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) mapping. The microcopy image in Figure 1c (captured 
from Supporting Video 1) illustrates the micromotor movement in gastric fluid simulant (pH 
1.3). Efficient hydrogen bubble generation propels the micromotor with an average speed of 
60 μm/s, indicating that these micromotors can rapidly react and move in gastric fluid.
The ability of Mg micromotors to neutralize gastric acid and trigger release of their payload 
was first tested in vitro. Figure 2a displays the time-dependent pH neutralization process 
associated with the built-in proton consumption during the reaction and propulsion of Mg 
micromotors in simulated gastric fluid (initial pH 1.3), using 2.75 mg of micromotors and 3 
mL gastric fluid. The pH of the fluid increases rapidly from 1.3 to 6.2 within 12 min, and 
then more slowly, stabilizing around pH 7.5 after 18 min. These data confirm that a fast 
neutralization of gastric acid can be realized within less than 20 min, compared to 1 h 
typically required by using PPIs to reach the same level of neutralization.[1] Fluorescent pH 
indicator BCECF was also used to verify the fast pH neutralization of the gastric fluid by the 
micromotors. As displayed in Figure 2b, in the absence of Mg micromotors, the gastric fluid 
containing the BCECF indicator displays a light yellow color and very weak fluorescence 
intensity, indicative of acidic conditions. In contrast, an obvious color change to red is 
observed 20 min after adding the Mg micromotors to the gastric fluid; the fluorescence 
intensity drastically increases a similar level of that observed in a PBS buffer (pH 7.4) as a 
control solution. These results demonstrate that the Mg micromotors can rapidly neutralize 
the gastric fluid through fast proton depletion and efficient propulsion. The fast 
neutralization process reflects the dramatic fluid convection induced by the collective 
motion of micromotors in the gastric fluid and the corresponding bubble generation. Such 
motor-induced “self-stirring” has been shown to accelerate environmental decontamination 
processes.[36]
To study the pH-responsive release, enabled by the active neutralization of the gastric fluid, 
R6G dye was used as a model payload encapsulated within the pH-sensitive EUDRAGIT® 
L100-55 polymeric coating of the Mg micromotors. Inert polystyrene (PS) microspheres 
(diameter: 10 μm) coated with the R6G dye-loaded polymer layer was used as a control 
group. Figure 2c displays the payload release profile, obtained by measuring the supernatant 
fluorescence intensity, using the micromotors and inert (control) particles placed in the 
acidic gastric fluid (initial pH 1.3). The pH change associated with the presence of the Mg 
micromotors results in sustained release of R6G from the pH-sensitive polymeric coating. 
The fluorescence of the gastric fluid solution thus increases gradually and reaches a plateau 
at 20 min. In contrast, no such R6G release is observed using the inert PS microparticles that 
do not react with the protons to cause a pH change and thus the pH-sensitive polymer 
coating remains stable.

 The fluorescence microscopy image of Figure 2d (captured from Supporting Video 2) 
displays the real-time propulsion and payload release of R6G from a Mg micromotor in the 
gastric fluid. The strong fluorescence signals observed on the micromotor body and the 
yellow bubble tail confirm the gradual dissolution of the polymer and consequent release of 
R6G. Figure 2e shows the corresponding fluorescence photographs of R6G in 1 mL bulk 
gastric solution in the presence of Mg micromotors and inert control microparticles (both 
coated with R6G-loaded pH-sensitive polymer), respectively. These images clearly show 
that the dye is released to the solution using micromotors but resides in the sediment at the 
bottom (containing the inert microparticles). This behavior indicates that the Mg 
micromotors, which actively neutralize the gastric fluid, can trigger drug release. This 
represents a distinct advantage of the autonomous micromotor-based delivery concept, over 
conventional stimuli-responsive drug release systems, as the micromotors themselves 
actively create the desired environment (stimuli) essential to trigger the release.
The in vivo study of Mg micromotors was further conducted by using a mouse model. In the 
study, the pH neutralization process was investigated by administrating different amounts of 
Mg micromotors (0, 2.5 mg, 5 mg and 10 mg) to four groups of mice (n=3 for each group). 
Upon oral administration for 20 min, the mice were euthanized and their stomach pH values 
were measured immediately using a microelectrode sensor coupled with a pH meter (as 
illustrated in Figure 3a). A 20-min time point was selected based on the in vitro study that 
has shown the Mg micromotors were able to effectively neutralize gastric acid within this 
time window. As shown in Figure 3b, this experiment resulted in a clear dose-dependent 
gastric pH change. Herein, 5 mg of Mg micromotors was able to neutralize gastric acid in 
the mouse stomach, resulting in pH=7.81±0.38. This motor concentration was higher than 
the 2.75 mg per 3 mL gastric acid as observed in the in vitro study. Such increase of motor 
amount was likely due to the continuous secretion of gastric acid from gastric glands in the 
mouse stomach, as well as the dynamic peristalsis wave of the stomach tissue that 
counteracts and dilutes the pH neutralization efficacy of the micromotors. Lower and higher 
doses of Mg micromotors resulted in slightly acidic and alkaline stomach environments (pH 
4.24 for 2.5 mg Mg micromotors and pH 9.43 for 10 mg Mg micromotors, respectively). 
Using deionized (DI) water as a control resulted in a constant acidic stomach pH (1.88), 
which further supports that no pH neutralization occurs in the absence of Mg micromotors. 
Since 5 mg of Mg micromotors can neutralize the gastric acid to about neutral value in the 
mouse stomach, this motor dosage was chosen for further studies.
Next, we studied the in vivo pH-responsive payload release by orally administrating 
fluorescently labeled Mg micromotors. DiD was chosen as a model drug, and was loaded in 
the pH-sensitive polymer coating. After 20 min administration, the entire stomach was 
excised and cut opened along the greater curvature for fluorescence imaging. As shown in 
Figure 3c, the stomach from mice treated with 5 mg Mg micromotors displays strong and 
evenly distributed fluorescence intensity over the entire stomach, reflecting the pH change 
due to the proton depletion by the active Mg micromotors. Apparently, the Mg micromotor 
delivery system can actively tune the stomach environment to facilitate dissolution of pH-
sensitive polymer and release of the payload. In contrast, mice treated with an equal amount 
of inert PS microparticles displays only some small local areas of the stomach with low 
fluorescence signal, similar to the fluorescence signal observed using the DI water control,

 reflecting the self-fluorescence of the administered food. As expected, the inert PS 
microparticles do not alter the stomach pH, and hence cannot trigger dissolution of the pH-
sensitive polymer and consequent payload release. Overall, in agreement with the early in 
vitro results, Figure 3. demonstrates the ability of Mg micromotors to neutralize gastric acid 
in the stomach of live animals and trigger the dissolution of the pH-responsive polymer 
coating with the consequent payload release. The micromotor thus serves as a motile carrier 
that enhances transport of its payload to different locations. The efficient local propulsion, 
along with the corresponding bubble tail, have shown to generate an effective convective 
fluid transport, to substantially enhance the delivery of cargo compared to passive-diffusion 
systems..[36–37] Furthermore, the propulsion of Mg micromotors provides a driving force to 
penetrate the mucus layer and enhance the payload retention in the stomach, which has been 
illustrated in early micromotor studies within the stomach and GI tract.[31,32]
To ensure the recovery of gastric pH after Mg micromotor treatment, the pH of stomach 
content was measured at 20 min and 24 h after administration of the motors (Figure 4a). 
After the pH change induced by Mg micromotor, the mean gastric pH returned to 2.16 
within 24h post-treatment which is close to pH 1.88 of control group treated with DI water. 
To further confirm the in vivo recovery of gastric pH, the pH indicator BCECF with a pKa~ 
6.98 was employed. The stomachs were dissected along the greater curvature and excess 
gastric content was removed. BCECF fluorescence dye was evenly distributed and mixed 
with the gastric content on the stomach tissues. Fluorescence imaging of BCECF was 
performed on the different treatment groups (Figure 4b). When the environmental pH is 
greater than its pKa, BCECF exhibits strong fluorescence emission, as shown by the 
stomach sample treated with micromotors for 20 min. In contrast, 24 h after administrating 
the Mg micromotors, the gastric content labeled with BCECF indicator showed weak 
fluorescence intensity, reflecting the low pH condition. The results from Figure 4a–b 
designate the transient pH neutralization effect of the Mg micromotors and that the normal 
acidity of gastric content can be recovered following the motor treatment.
Finally, the gastric toxicity of the administrated Mg micromotors was evaluated. Mice were 
orally administered with 5 mg of Mg micromotor or DI water and monitored for general 
toxicity symptoms every 2 h for the first 10 h post-administration. No observable signs of 
pain such as hunched posture, unkempt fur, or lethargy were observed in both groups. The 
Mg micromotor’s toxicity was further investigated by histological analysis. Hematoxylin 
and eosin (H&E) stained cross-section of glandular stomach from the micromotor-treated 
group showed intact glandular mucosa with no signs of superficial degeneration of columnar 
epithelial cells or erosion (Figure 5a). There was no observable difference in the crypt and 
villus size and number, or mucosal thickness, between the motor-treated and water-treated 
groups. Moreover, lymphocitic infiltration into the mucosa and submucosa was not apparent, 
implicating no sign of gastric inflammation. The potential toxicity of the Mg micromotors 
was further evaluated using gastric tissue sections by a terminal deoxynucleotidyl 
transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay to 
examine the level of gastric epithelial apoptosis as an indicator of gastric mucosal 
homeostasis. No apparent increase in gastric epithelial apoptosis was observed for 
micromotor-treated groups as compared to the water control group (Figure 5b). Overall, the 
in vivo toxicity studies demonstrate no interference in gastric pH homeostasis, and no

 apparent gastric histopathologic change or inflammation, suggesting that the oral 
administration of Mg micromotors is safe in a mouse model. The Mg micromotors can thus 
temporarily adjust the stomach pH without adverse effects, making them an attractive 
vehicle for gastric drug delivery.
We have demonstrated that acid-powered micromotors can operate as an active microdevice 
to efficiently and temporarily adjust local physiological parameters in vivo for diverse 
biomedical applications. In particular, the reaction of the motor’s magnesium core with the 
gastric fluid leads to rapid proton depletion and thus acid neutralization without affecting the 
normal stomach function or causing adverse effects, making these synthetic micromotors an 
attractive alternative to proton pump inhibitors. The fast and efficient neutralization reflects 
the localized fluid convection generated by the micromotor movement. When coupled to a 
pH-sensitive payload-containing polymer coating, this pH change can lead to autonomous 
release of the encapsulated cargo. The new microvehicle thus combines self-propulsion, acid 
neutralization, along with cargo transport and release. Its Mg engine converts the acid fuel to 
propulsion force and simultaneously alters the local pH that leads to payload release from 
the pH-sensitive coating, Such micromotor-based delivery vehicle can thus actively adjust 
the local environment to achieve desired conditions for triggered payload release.

the pH-sensitive polymer coating (starts to dissolve at pH > 5.5) as a model payload. 
Polystyrene (PS)-based inert microparticles with a similar size as the Mg micromotors were 
used as a negative control. (d) Fluorescence image showing the propulsion and release 
processes of an R6G-loaded Mg micromotor. Scale bar: 20 μm. (e) Fluorescence images of 
the released R6G in the supernatant of gastric fluid containing Mg micromotors (left) or PS 
microparticles (right).

In vivo acid neutralization and pH-triggered payload release. (a) Schematic illustration of in 
vivo gastric acid neutralization process by Mg micromotors and pH measurement using a 
microelectrode-enabled pH meter. (b) In vivo gastric pH values using a mouse model (n=3) 
measured 20 min post administration of different amounts of Mg micromotors. DI water was 
used as a negative control. (c) Superimposed fluorescent images of the whole stomach of 
mice collected 20 min post administration of DI water, Mg micromotors, or inert PS 
microparticles (both Mg micromotors and PS microparticles are loaded with DiD dye which 
is encapsulated in the pH-sensitive polymer coating as a model drug). Scale bars: 5 mm.
