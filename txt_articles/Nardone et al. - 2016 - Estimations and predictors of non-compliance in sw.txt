Abstract
Background and Aims—Clinical trials on the impact and safety of reduced nicotine content 
cigarettes (RNCs) are ongoing, and an important methodological concern is participant 
compliance with smoking only RNCs. Our aims were to measure non-compliance biochemically 
with urine cotinine (COT) and total nicotine equivalents (TNEs), compare with self-reported non-
compliance, and identify associated covariates.
Design—Secondary analysis of a double-blind, parallel, randomized clinical trial.
Setting—10 research centers from the USA, enrolling participants from June 2013 to July 2014.
Participants—Volunteer sample of 242 participants (55% Caucasian), average age of 41.2 years, 
smoking at least 5 cigarettes per day (CPD).

 Intervention—Smoking very low nicotine cigarettes (VLNCs; 0.4mg nicotine/g tobacco) for 6-
weeks.
Measurements—The primary outcome was biochemically verified non-compliance, measured 
as thresholds of COT/CPD and TNE/CPD ratios, considering changes in nicotine content from 
conventional levels to VLNCs, and as an absolute threshold of Week 6 TNEs. Self-reported non-
compliance was measured via daily phone calls. Key predictors included age, sex, race, menthol 
preference, nicotine metabolite ratio, time to first cigarette, dependence, CPD, TNEs, tar level and 
cigarette evaluation.
Findings—Estimates of non-compliance with smoking the VLNC cigarettes exclusively include: 
the biochemical ratios (both 78%), the Week 6 TNE threshold (76%) and self-report (39%). Of the 
key covariates, age, dependence and cigarette evaluations of satisfaction were significant; for age, 
younger participants more likely to be non-compliant (p=0.01; OR=0.98, 95% CI: 0.96–0.99). 
Dependence was significantly associated with self-reported non-compliance (p=0.01; OR=1.28, 
95% CI: 1.06–1.55). Cigarette evaluations of satisfaction were significantly associated with non-
compliance (p=0.001; OR=0.71, 95% CI: 0.61–0.82).
Conclusions—Biochemical assessments detect many more cases of non-compliance than self-
report, and non-compliance with smoking VLNCs is observed in the majority of participants. 
Despite non-compliance, smokers reduced their intake of nicotine by an average of 60%, 
supporting the utility of nicotine reduction.
Introduction
The US Food and Drug Administration and regulators in other countries have the authority 
to establish tobacco product standards1. Mandated reductions in the nicotine content of 
cigarettes to make then less addictive, has been discussed in the US2–4 and New Zealand5, 
and in international meetings6 as a promising cigarette “end game” approach7. If this 
intervention is successful in one country, it is likely others will try similar approaches. 
Because nicotine is the primary addictive constituent in cigarettes, a mandated reduction 
would likely substantially reduce cigarette smoking behavior and improve public health.
Multiple studies have been conducted to evaluate the effect of nicotine reduction in 
cigarettes 8–12 with follow-up periods of up to 24 months, showing that switching to reduced 
nicotine content cigarettes (RNCs) resulted in a reduction in cigarettes smoked per day8–12 
and self-reported dependence8,10,12,, and few adverse events9–12. A challenge to the 
interpretation of these studies is that while the research questions pertain to a regulatory 
environment in which only RNCs are available, the clinical trials are conducted in an 
unregulated environment in which participants can use other products, including their usual 
brand cigarettes. One study did ensure compliance by enrolling participants in an inpatient 
setting, and this study also observed a decrease in smoking13.
Because smokers tend to be brand-loyal, and RNCs may not satisfy in the same manner as 
the usual brand14, study participants often continue to smoke some conventional cigarettes 
even when they are asked to only smoke RNC investigational cigarettes. Additionally, 
participants may not honestly self-report non-compliance. Any level of non-compliance may

 influence estimates of the effect of RNCs, and studying the extent of non-compliance in the 
context of nicotine reduction is important.
In a previous publication, we estimated non-compliance with exclusive use of very low 
nicotine content (VLNC) cigarettes by measuring plasma levels of the major nicotine 
metabolite, cotinine, normalized for cigarette consumption, and comparing within-subject 
ratios of change in cotinine to the expected change in nicotine exposure based on the 
product15. The cutoff for compliance allowed for up to a 4-fold increase in nicotine exposure 
compared to baseline to accommodate potential compensation (i.e., smoking cigarettes more 
intensively) or other sources of variability (e.g., inaccurate reporting of CPD, differences in 
nicotine content of usual brand from our assumption of 10 mg, biological variability due to 
differences in renal clearance of nicotine and metabolites, assay variability, etc) without 
judging the smoker to be non-compliant. It should be noted that 400% compensatory 
smoking is unlikely to occur, especially given lack of evidence that total puff volume, or the 
intensity of smoking RNC cigarettes, significantly increases in prior studies12. Using this 
method, 60% of participants were determined to be non-compliant with smoking the VLNC 
cigarettes exclusively. These objective data were in contrast to 21% of participants self-
reporting some level of non-compliance. This analysis demonstrated the necessity of 
measuring non-compliance biochemically and not relying exclusively on self-report.
A second study was undertaken in which participants smoked VLNC cigarettes exclusively 
in a controlled environment16. Participants were sequestered in a hotel and smoked only 
VLNCs for 4 days. Pooled urines were collected each day and urine total nicotine 
equivalents (TNE; the sum of nicotine and six metabolites) were assayed. Total nicotine 
equivalents are less influenced by changes in metabolism than cotinine, thus more accurately 
estimate nicotine exposure17. Of those smoking only VLNC cigarettes (0.4 mg nicotine/g 
tobacco), the 95th percentile for TNE was 6.41 nmol/mL. This threshold was proposed as 
another method by which compliance could be biochemically confirmed.
The current study utilizes data from a large clinical trial12 to measure and compare three 
biochemical estimations of non-compliance with VLNC cigarettes. First, it replicates the 
biochemical estimation of cotinine normalized for cigarette consumption; secondly, it adds 
an additional analysis of TNE normalized for cigarette consumption; and lastly it measures 
absolute TNE thresholds for non-compliance. Biochemical methods are compared with self-
report, as this measure is typically used to assess compliance. In addition, the study reports 
50% and 75% reductions in TNEs to explore the proportion of participants with large 
reductions in nicotine exposure who were likely partially compliant but supplemented 
VLNCs with some usual brand cigarettes.
Finally, since none of the preceding studies measured factors associated with VLNC 
cigarette compliance, the current study assesses variables based on known associations with 
smoking cessation rates: age, sex, race, menthol preference, nicotine metabolite ratio 
(NMR), time to first cigarette, dependence, CPD, and TNEs 18–25. Tar level was also 
included as a predictor as it varied between the two VLNC groups. Tar influences the 
sensory impact of cigarette smoke, and cigarette evaluations of satisfaction and reward as 
sensory effects can influence compliance25.

 Methods
Design
A double-blind, parallel, randomized clinical trial was conducted in which 840 daily 
smokers were randomized to 7 possible cigarette conditions including their usual brand or 1 
of 6 research cigarettes (Spectrum cigarettes, obtained from National Institutes on Drug 
Abuse)17. One participant was determined to be ineligible after randomization and was 
excluded.
Participants
Participants were healthy volunteers who were required to smoke at least 5 cigarettes per 
day for the past 12 months, and not have used other nicotine/tobacco products more than 9 
times in the past 30 days.
Intervention
Participants were asked to smoke only their assigned research cigarettes for 6 weeks, 
although, compliance was not incentivized. If participants smoked non-study cigarettes or 
used other nicotine/tobacco products (i.e. e-cigarettes, smokeless tobacco, cigars and 
nicotine replacement therapies) they were encouraged to report this to researchers at every 
study visit.
The study cigarettes contained the following nicotine contents (mg nicotine/g tobacco) 
averaged across menthol and non-menthol products: 15.8, 5.2, 2.4, 1.3, 0.4, and 0.4-HT 
(high tar). When assigned to study product, participants were given menthol vs. non-menthol 
cigarettes based on preference. For purposes of these non-compliance estimations, the focus 
will be on the lowest level of nicotine (i.e. 0.4 mg/g) which includes 242 participants. Within 
this group, there were two levels of tar yields (i.e.13 mg and 9 mg). We focused on the 
VLNC group because the large difference in nicotine levels between conventional and 
VLNC cigarettes allowed us to be confident in assessing compliance. This is not possible 
with higher levels of nicotine content, because when nicotine levels are closer to those of 
conventional cigarettes and there is possible compensatory smoking or other sources of 
variability as mentioned previously, there can easily be overlap in nicotine intake between 
compliers and non-compliers14.
Measurements
At baseline, a first morning void urine was collected and participants completed a battery of 
questionnaires, including the Fagerström Test for Nicotine Dependence (FTND)27. 
Participants were enrolled in an Interactive Voice Response (IVR) system (InterVision 
Media) two weeks prior to their baseline visit, which called them daily and prompted them 
to enter the number of study and non-study cigarettes they smoked the previous day. 
Participants reported any alternative nicotine/tobacco product use during their weekly study 
visits, and the Cigarette Evaluation Scale (CES)28 was administered after the first week on 
study cigarettes. At the end of Week 6, urine was collected again and questionnaires were 
repeated.

 Urine samples, collected at baseline and Week 6, were analyzed for TNEs, the molar sum of 
nicotine and six metabolites, a measure of daily nicotine intake. Total nicotine, total 
cotinine, total trans 3′-hydroxycotinine (“total” refers to the sum of the analyte and its 
respective glucuronide conjugate) and nicotine-N-oxide were quantified in β-glucuronidase 
treated urine by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) analysis as 
previously described9. The salivary ratio of 3-hydroxycotinine to cotinine (NMR, nicotine 
metabolite ratio) was measured as a phenotypic marker of the rate of nicotine metabolism, 
which has been associated with daily cigarette consumption and the level of tobacco 
dependence30, 31.
In measuring non-compliance, we applied the cotinine/CPD ratio method as previously 
reported14. The VLNC group was assigned 0.4 mg/g (nominal mg content), which 
corresponds to 0.26 mg nicotine/cigarette. While the weight of the tobacco differs slightly 
across cigarettes 15, 0.26mg was a conservative estimate. As there are no public data on the 
nicotine content of many brands of conventional cigarettes, we assumed based on literature 
that their usual brand cigarette contained 10 mg/cigarette of nicotine32. We divided the mg/
cigarette content by the assumed usual brand content (0.26mg/10mg=0.026) and allowed for 
up to 4-fold higher ratio to allow for compensatory smoking, use of other nicotine 
containing substances and/or other sources of variability, (0.026 * 4= 0.10). Thus, any 
participant with a ratio (baseline COT/CPD divided by Week 6 COT/CPD) greater than 0.10 
would be considered non-compliant.
Next, we considered the TNE/CPD ratio, which was defined analogously to the COT/CPD 
ratio described above. This method was expected to have high concordance with the 
COT/CPD ratio, however, testing cotinine and TNE separately could provide different 
estimations of exposure.
The third method measured absolute TNE values. Based on previous data from smokers 
known to be compliant with VLNC cigarettes, as described in the methods16, fully 
compliant subjects are unlikely to have TNEs above 6.41 nmol/mL. Therefore smokers with 
TNEs above 6.41nmol/mL would be considered non-compliant.
The final method to assess non-compliance was self-report. The primary measure of self-
reported non-compliance was any non-study cigarette use reported on daily IVR calls within 
Week 6, as this assessment corresponded to the timing of the urinary biomarker collection at 
Week 6. Secondarily, self-reported non-study cigarette use from Weeks 1 through Weeks 6 
was determined.
The extent of partial non-compliance was assessed by examining the percent of subjects who 
reduced their urinary TNEs to 50% or 75% of baseline at Week 6.
Statistical Analysis
Measures of non-compliance were analyzed on the log-scale, except for the reduction in 
TNEs which was measured with raw values. The association between baseline covariates 
and continuous measures of non-compliance (COT/CPD ratios, TNE/CPD ratios and

 absolute TNEs) was evaluated using linear regression and summarized by the ratio of 
geometric means (RGM) of the predictor variables.
Covariates included age, race, sex, menthol preference, NMR, time to first cigarette, 
dependence (FTND scores, with and without CPD), baseline CPD, TNE, tar level and the 
CES satisfaction and reward subscales. We considered a univariate model for each covariate, 
as well as a multivariate model that included age, race, sex, NMR, menthol status, time to 
first cigarette and FTND (without the CPD item). Secondly, we completed a logistic 
regression analysis, which treated non-compliance as a dichotomous outcome defined by the 
COT/CPD ratio, TNE/CPD ratio, absolute TNEs and self-reported non-compliance. The 
model described above was again repeated with dichotomous outcomes.
Results
214 of the 242 VLNC smoker participants had available biomarker data for biochemical 
analysis of compliance. Baseline characteristics by availability of biomarker data are shown 
in Table 1, with the only significant difference being in race/ethnicity. There were no 
significant demographic differences between the combined VLNC groups (N=242) and the 
rest of the sample (N=598).
Compliance Analysis
The COT/CPD ratio comparing week 6 to baseline indicated 78% had some level of non-
compliance. There were no significant differences in non-compliance between high and 
regular tar groups (79% non-complaint and 77% non-compliant, respectively, p=0.84). Thus 
all other results are reported with the groups combined. The distribution of ratios for all 
VLNC participants is shown in Figure 1.
The TNE/CPD ratio indicated 78% had some level of non-compliance, demonstrating high 
concordance with the COT/CPD ratio. A 2X2 comparison of both methods is shown in Table 
2a, indicating that a vast majority (98%) of participants who were found non-compliant 
using the COT/CPD ratio criterion were also found non-compliant using the TNE/CPD ratio 
criterion. Ratios generated by these two methods were strongly correlated with one another 
(r=0.97, p<0.001).
Absolute TNE values were highly correlated with the COT/CPD ratios (r=0.75, p<0.001), 
and with the TNE/CPD ratios (r=0.77, p<0.001). A 2X2 comparison of the COT/CPD and 
absolute TNE methods is shown in Table 2b, indicating that a vast majority (96%) of 
participants who were found to have some level of non-compliance using the COT/CPD 
ratio criterion were also found non-compliant using the absolute TNE criterion.
When examining partial non-compliance using the reduction in urinary TNEs, 
approximately 45% of subjects reduced their daily intake to 50% of baseline and 61% of 
subjects to 75% of baseline.
Non-compliance was self-reported at Week 6 by 39% of participants in the VLNC group 
who completed their IVR calls at Week 6 (N=225). Non-compliance was reported by 80% of 
VLNC participants at any time between Weeks 1 and Weeks 6. Within the control 15.8 mg/g

 group, 57% of participants self-reported non-compliance at least one time across all weeks 
of the study. A small minority of participants in the VLNC groups (N=9) reported the use of 
other nicotine/tobacco products at some time during the study. Of those participants, five had 
COT/CPD, TNE/CPD ratios and TNE levels consistent with compliance.
Figure 2 demonstrates rates of non-compliance with exclusive use of 0.4 mg/g VLNC 
cigarettes assessed by all methods.
Predictors of Non-Compliance
Linear regression results examining continuous measures of non-compliance indicated that 
age was significantly associated with the COT/CPD ratio and TNE/CPD ratio and was 
marginally associated with TNEs, such that younger subjects on average had higher 
geometric means. Similar results were observed for age in the multivariate model.
Baseline CPD was significantly associated with TNEs, such that the higher the baseline CPD 
the higher the geometric mean TNEs. However, baseline CPD was not significantly 
associated with TNEs in the multivariate model and was not significantly associated with the 
COT/CPD ratio or the TNE/CPD ratio. Baseline TNEs was not significantly associated with 
the COT/CPD ratio.
Cigarette evaluations of satisfaction and reward were significantly associated with the 
COT/CPD ratio, TNE/CPD ratio and TNEs, such that the lower satisfaction and reward were 
associated with higher geometric mean values. CES-satisfaction was significantly associated 
with non-compliance in the multivariate model however CES-reward was not. Linear 
regression results for unadjusted and adjusted models are shown in Table 3.
A logistic regression analysis was conducted with dichotomous biochemical non-compliance 
outcomes and self-reported non-compliance, with both univariate and multivariate models. 
Results for both models mirrored those of the linear regression with significant covariates of 
age, CES-satisfaction and reward predicting biochemical non-compliance. In predicting self-
reported non-compliance, dependence (measured as baseline FTND without the CPD 
variable) was the only significant predictor. Higher dependence was associated with an 
increased rate of self-reported non-compliance OR=1.28, 95% CI: 1.06–1.55, p=0.01.
Discussion
Our study comparing the effects of reducing the nicotine content of cigarettes on smoking 
behavior and related symptoms was conducted to help provide a science base for possible 
future product regulatory action to reduce the addictiveness of cigarettes12. We asked 
subjects to smoke only the research cigarettes so that we could assess their response to 
RNCs. However, unlike a potential future regulatory scenario in which policy would 
mandate all available cigarettes and cigarette tobacco be low in nicotine, at present 
conventional cigarettes are widely available to participants in RNC studies. An important 
question in generalizing our research findings to a real-world reduced nicotine regulatory 
situation and possibly informing optimal strategies for nicotine reduction, is how well 
subjects comply with use of investigational cigarettes and with nicotine reduction. Indeed,

 even those in the normal nicotine condition self-reported non-compliance, indicating that 
there is difficulty with compliance when brand switching. As we observed in a previous 
study of nicotine reduction with a smaller number of subjects, non-compliance was quite 
high15. In the present study non-compliance was 76–78% using biochemical assessment and 
39% by self-report. Despite a high rate of non-compliance, the reduction in TNEs from 
baseline to Week 6 demonstrates that the experimental endpoint of nicotine reduction was 
partially met by the majority of subjects.
One of the aims of our study was to compare different methods of assessing compliance – 
three biochemical approaches and self-report. Two of the biochemical approaches were 
similar, examining individual changes in nicotine intake (assessed by urine cotinine or urine 
TNE) normalized for cigarette consumption, in comparison to predicted changes based on 
the difference in nicotine content of the RNC and the conventional cigarette. Some smokers 
might smoke more intensively to compensate for low nicotine availability. The extent of 
compensation when nicotine availability was limited by restricting the number of cigarettes 
available to smoke each day has been shown to as high as 300%33. While unlikely, we 
allowed for the possibility of 400% compensation or other sources of variability in the 
biochemical estimation so as to give subjects the maximal leeway before classifying them as 
non-compliant. Even with this liberal criterion, nearly 80% were non-complaint. The third 
biochemical approach used an absolute urine TNE value based on empirical observations of 
smokers confined to a hotel where they could smoke only research cigarettes12. This 
approach yielded a slightly lower, rate of non-compliance at 75%. Self-report yielded the 
lowest rate of non-compliance at 39%.
Biochemical measures of non-compliance produced similar rates and are, as expected, much 
more sensitive than self-report. Given that cotinine is the most straightforward biomarker to 
measure, we would recommend that the COT/CPD ratio method be used by researchers 
interested in measuring non-compliance.
We measured demographic and smoking related predictors of non-compliance. We found no 
significant associations between sex, race, menthol cigarette use, NMR, severity of 
dependence or time-to-first cigarette and compliance. Age influenced compliance, such that 
younger smokers were more likely to be non-compliant. Possible explanations for an age 
effect include that older smokers might be more motivated to quit and viewed the study as a 
possible method for quitting or that older smokers had more prior quit attempts and were 
more comfortable with nicotine withdrawal symptoms. Another possibility is that young 
subjects may have been generally less compliant with study procedures overall, such as 
attending visits as scheduled and on time. Indeed, younger participants were significantly 
more likely to drop out of the study both in the total sample (p<0.001) and trending in the 
VLNC groups (p=0.17).
While baseline CPD and dependence did not predict non-compliance in general, we did find 
that CPD predicted non-compliance using the absolute urine TNE approach. This is not 
surprising since a person smoking a high number of VLNC cigarettes per day would be 
expected to have levels of TNE closer to the TNE cutoff which was based on the 95 
percentile of all VLNC cigarette smokers and could therefore appear non-compliant when

 they really were compliant. Conversely, a smoker of few CPD could smoke a few 
conventional cigarettes and still have TNE below the upper threshold limit, and therefore 
appear compliant when they were not. Additionally, we found that evaluations of the study 
cigarettes, especially how satisfying they were, significantly predicted non-compliance. This 
finding points to the importance of somatosensory aspects in the acceptability of reduced 
nicotine cigarettes.
The present analysis focused only on the lowest nicotine content group in the clinical trial, 
where non-compliance would be expected to be most likely. Still, within this group, self-
reported dependence and daily nicotine intake were lower at the end of the trial compared to 
the control condition and on average nicotine intake was reduced by 60%12, indicating that 
despite non-compliance, participants were still substantially reducing their exposure and 
dependence.
We are unable to do the same biochemical estimations with higher nicotine content 
cigarettes due to overlapping influences of non-compliance and low levels of compensatory 
smoking. Self-reported non-study cigarette use was more likely to occur with cigarettes of 
5.2 mg/g of nicotine or less as compared to the usual brand or 15.8 mg/g control group12. 
However, it is important to note that even in the 15.8 mg/g group, 57% of participants self-
reported non-compliance at least once throughout the study, compared to the usual brand at 
37%, suggesting that non-compliance is not only driven by nicotine reduction, but also by 
dissatisfaction with the use of investigational cigarettes.
Our results suggest that the nicotine availability and sensory aspects of the VLNC cigarettes 
were not sufficient to satisfy individual needs. On the other hand a substantial degree of 
nicotine reduction was tolerated by most subjects. Thus, while most smokers engaged in 
some non-compliance, they did not smoke conventional cigarettes to the extent that they 
achieved a daily nicotine intake similar to their baseline. The extent to which smokers seek 
additional nicotine to reduce withdrawal symptoms or for positive reinforcement or because 
they did not like the taste of the research cigarettes is unclear, and remains an important 
question.
The implications of our analysis are as follows. First, studies examining behavioral, 
subjective and physiological effects of VLNC cigarettes need to be extrapolated cautiously 
to a real-world nicotine reduction environment in which conventional cigarettes are 
unavailable, as studies may underestimate certain effects of switching to VLNC cigarettes 
(e.g., on craving and withdrawal symptoms, number of cigarettes smoked, quitting attempts) 
due to non-compliant use of usual-brand cigarettes. Second, even when smokers are able to 
reduce their daily nicotine intake substantially, they may be motivated to supplement with 
additional nicotine. The exact reasons for this are not yet determined, but could be relief of 
withdrawal symptoms, the effect of brand switching, need for arousal or mood-altering 
effects of nicotine and/or conditioned responses. A national nicotine reduction policy might 
work best if clean alternative sources of nicotine were readily available to deal with nicotine 
withdrawal symptoms and craving1.
