Abstract
Background
Estimating the burden of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) compared to other com-
municable diseases is an ongoing challenge given the need for good quality data on the
incidence of these infections and the involved comorbidities. Based on the methodology of
the Burden of Communicable Diseases in Europe (BCoDE) project and 2011–2012 data
from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) point prevalence
survey (PPS) of HAIs and antimicrobial use in European acute care hospitals, we estimated
the burden of six common HAIs.
Methods and Findings
The included HAIs were healthcare-associated pneumonia (HAP), healthcare-associated
urinary tract infection (HA UTI), surgical site infection (SSI), healthcare-associated Clostrid-
ium difficile infection (HA CDI), healthcare-associated neonatal sepsis, and healthcare-
associated primary bloodstream infection (HA primary BSI). The burden of these HAIs was
measured in disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). Evidence relating to the disease pro-
gression pathway of each type of HAI was collected through systematic literature reviews,
in order to estimate the risks attributable to HAIs. For each of the six HAIs, gender and age
group prevalence from the ECDC PPS was converted into incidence rates by applying the
Rhame and Sudderth formula. We adjusted for reduced life expectancy within the hospital
population using three severity groups based on McCabe score data from the ECDC PPS.

 We estimated that 2,609,911 new cases of HAI occur every year in the European Union
and European Economic Area (EU/EEA). The cumulative burden of the six HAIs was esti-
mated at 501 DALYs per 100,000 general population each year in EU/EEA. HAP and HA
primary BSI were associated with the highest burden and represented more than 60% of
the total burden, with 169 and 145 DALYs per 100,000 total population, respectively. HA
UTI, SSI, HA CDI, and HA primary BSI ranked as the third to sixth syndromes in terms of
burden of disease. HAP and HA primary BSI were associated with the highest burden
because of their high severity. The cumulative burden of the six HAIs was higher than the
total burden of all other 32 communicable diseases included in the BCoDE 2009–2013
study. The main limitations of the study are the variability in the parameter estimates, in par-
ticular the disease models’ case fatalities, and the use of the Rhame and Sudderth formula
for estimating incident number of cases from prevalence data.
Conclusions
We estimated the EU/EEA burden of HAIs in DALYs in 2011–2012 using a transparent and
evidence-based approach that allows for combining estimates of morbidity and of mortality
in order to compare with other diseases and to inform a comprehensive ranking suitable for
prioritization. Our results highlight the high burden of HAIs and the need for increased
efforts for their prevention and control. Furthermore, our model should allow for estimations
of the potential benefit of preventive measures on the burden of HAIs in the EU/EEA.
Author Summary
Why Was This Study Done?
• Infections acquired in hospitals are a common and largely preventable complication of
hospitalisation and surgery affecting approximately 1 in 20 patients.
• We measured the burden of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) in disability-
adjusted life years (DALYs), thus also enabling comparison with the burden of other
diseases.
• Calculating the burden of HAIs is challenging given the underlying disease that caused
the initial hospitalisation.
What Did the Researchers Do and Find?
• We estimated the burden of six common HAIs in DALYs: healthcare-associated pneu-
monia (HAP), healthcare-associated urinary tract infection (HA UTI), surgical site
infection (SSI), healthcare-associated C. difficile infection (HA CDI), healthcare-associ-
ated neonatal sepsis, and healthcare-associated primary bloodstream infection (HA pri-
mary BSI).

literature. Moreover, life expectancywas adjusted according to the severity of the under-
lying condition.
• More than 2.5 million cases of HAI occur in the European Union and European Eco-
nomic Area (EU/EEA) each year, corresponding to approximately 2.5 million DALYs.
• HAP and HA primary BSI were responsible for the largest part of the total burden of
HAIs.
• The total burden of the six HAIs in Europe was higher than that of all other communica-
ble diseases under surveillanceat ECDC.
What Do These Findings Mean?
• HAIs represent a significant burden among infectious diseases in Europe, exceeding the
burden of other infections like influenza and tuberculosis.
• Increasing efforts for prevention are imperative to decrease this burden.
Introduction
Healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) are associated with increased morbidity and mortality
and excess costs, and because a significant proportion of them are preventable, they are consid-
ered to be a marker of quality of patient care [1]. Many studies have attempted to estimate the
number of cases of HAIs and of deaths attributable to these infections [2–6]. Such studies have
used descriptive methods, modelling approaches, or a combination of the two.
There is a well-established methodologyfor estimating the burden of diseases that takes
into account not only the incidence of the disease but also disabilities associated with their
complications and the years of life lost, resulting in a composite health measure, the disability-
adjusted life year (DALY) [7]. However, this methodologyhas not been applied to estimate an
overall burden of HAIs. This prevents comparisons of the burden of HAIs to that of other
infectious and noninfectious diseases, which would be particularly useful for healthcare profes-
sionals, policy makers, and the public.
One of the challenges in the estimation of the burden of HAIs is their special nature.
Patients with an HAI are or have recently been hospitalised or were subject to a surgical inter-
vention and have comorbidities that, beside the HAI, also contribute to morbidity and mortal-
ity. For this reason, it is essential to study patient outcomes that are specificallyattributable to
the HAI and not to the underlying disease. This includes calculating the expected individual
life years at the age of death for patients with HAI. Moreover, administrative hospital discharge
data that are commonly used to estimate the burden of other diseases do not accurately reflect
the burden of HAIs, making it necessary to identify other sources of data [8].

 We calculated the DALYs aiming at describing the burden of HAIs in acute care hospitals of
the European Union and European Economic Area (EU/EEA) using the methodologyof the
Burden of Communicable Diseases in Europe (BCoDE) project [9,10] and the results of the
European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) point prevalence survey (PPS)
of HAIs and antimicrobial use in European acute care hospitals [6].
Methods
Ethics Statement
This study was based on health information collected and published during the 2011–2012
PPS of HAIs in acute care hospitals within the EU/EEA [6] and did not require informed con-
sent from participants. Reported infectious disease data were provided in aggregate form by
specific age and gender strata, without any personal identifiers.
Study Design
The methodologyof the present study was adapted from the BCoDE project [10]. Specifically,
the burden of selected HAIs in acute care facilities was expressed through a composite health
measure reflecting the burden of disabilities and premature deaths against a prespecified ideal.
The approach is incidence-basedin order to best express current and future consequences of
infections, as well as the effect of future prevention and control interventions.
The present study used a syndrome-based approach and not the pathogen-based approach
used for other BCoDE-related outputs, with the exception of C. difficile. A vast array of patho-
gens cause HAIs, which can be split according to recognizable and similar syndromes. More-
over, the syndrome approach has more significant public health relevance both in terms of
surveillanceand in terms of hospital infection prevention and control.
Selection of syndromes was primarily based on availability of incidence data, systematic lit-
erature reviews, and discussion within a European panel of experts. The HAIs included in the
present study were healthcare-associated urinary tract infection (HA UTI), healthcare-associ-
ated primary bloodstream infection (HA primary BSI), healthcare-associated neonatal sepsis,
healthcare-associated C. difficile infection (HA CDI), surgical site infection (SSI), and health-
care-associated pneumonia (HAP), as defined by the EU/EEA case definitions [11].
Outcome Measure
The DALY is a composite health measure estimating years lived with disabilities (YLDs) fol-
lowing the onset of a disease and of years of life lost due to pre-mature mortality (YLLs) com-
pared to a standardized life expectancy[12]. YLDs include the length of time lived with
disabilities (duration) multiplied by disability weights reflecting the ill health incurred. In our
study, the latter were derived from the European disability weight project [13–15].
Data on life expectancywere obtained from the Global Burden of Disease 2010 (GBD 2010)
standard reference life table with the same life expectancyfor males and females, based on the
lowest observeddeath rate for any age group [12].
Disease Models and Correction for Comorbidities
Since HAIs occur in the context of comorbidities, adjustment for the effect of these comorbidi-
ties was necessary. In order to take into account all possible health consequences of HAIs, dis-
ease models or outcome trees were developed based on several systematic reviews of the
literature, focusing on the attributable risk of complications, death, and length of stay due to
the HAI [16,17]. An outcome tree represents the progression pathway of a disease over time,

 starting with the infection and ending with either recovery, a permanent disability, or death.
Health outcomes can include short-term complications (health states within a health outcome)
and long-term sequelae. Each health outcome is related to the other outcomes by a transitional
probability and includes a duration and a disability weight. The authors critically reviewed
each outcome tree stemming from a systematic review of the literature and discussed and
agreed on each parameter. The consensus-building procedure entailed four separate stages per-
formed between February and December 2015. The results from the systematic review [17]
were reviewed independently by the two authors (AC and DP) and the structure and parame-
ters for the final outcome tree indicatively selected during this first stage. During the second
stage, shared views were discussed and their reasons analysed in order to confirm a common
rationale. Disagreements were solved by discussion. The third stage included another expert
and author (CS), and disagreements were further analysed and discussed until consensus was
reached. The final and fourth stage entailed a final review by the head of the HAI programme
at ECDC and author of the present study (DM). The final HAI outcome trees were published
in the BCoDE toolkit on the ECDC website in December 2015. The disease model parameters
are describedin detail in the BCoDE toolkit [18] and are available in S1 Models.
Comorbidities also affect the life expectancyof hospitalised patients. Therefore, we catego-
rized the affected hospitalized population according to the McCabe score [19] that was
recorded for every patient enrolled in the ECDC PPS. The McCabe score gives an indication of
the life expectancyof a patient according to the severity of their underlying disease. Patients
are classified in three categories based on whether the underlying disease is nonfatal (McCabe
score 1, expected survival of more than 5 y), ultimately fatal (McCabe score 2, expected survival
between 1 and 5 y), or rapidly fatal (McCabe score 3, expected survival less than 1 y). The inci-
dence of each HAI was therefore divided into three groups based on McCabe score: McCabe
score 1 (standard average life expectancy),McCabe score 2 (3 y average life expectancy),and
McCabe score 3 (0.5 y average life expectancy)[19].
SSI incidence and severity vary widely depending on the site and nature of the surgical inter-
vention and the depth of the infection. One way to deal with this variability could have been to
focus the systematic review of the literature on SSIs following hip and knee joint replacements
and following coronary artery bypass grafts (CABGs), as examples of operations with predomi-
nantly acute (CABG) or chronic (joint replacement) infectious complications. However, the
results would only partially cover the full range of SSIs. Therefore, as a final decision for the SSI
outcome tree, a different approach was chosen: only the acute phase of the disease and the
attributable mortality were included based on data on overall SSI outcomes [20].
Study Population and Incidence
Estimates of the incidence of the selected HAIs were derived from the ECDC PPS, which was
conducted in 2011–2012 in 29 EU/EEA Member States and Croatia, and included data from a
total of 273,753 patients in 1,149 hospitals [6]. Since only acute care hospitals participated in
this ECDC PPS, other healthcare facilities such as long-term care facilities were not included in
our study.
The results of the ECDC PPS represent the EU/EEA Member States, with more that 510
million citizens according to 2011 Eurostat data. Five percent of the population was under 5 y
old, and 18% was 65 y and over. In the EU/EEA, there were 2,719,634 available beds in hospi-
tals [21], of which 1,840,514 were in acute care with 13,090 discharges of inpatients per
100,000 inhabitants in 2011 [22].
The gender-specific and age-group-specificyearly number of cases of HAIs (further
referred to as “patients with HAIs”) was calculated from the rate of new cases of HAI per 100

 admissions using the 2011 Eurostat data on the number of inpatient hospital discharges and
general population (see S1 Input) [22].
The rate of new cases of each type of HAI per 100 admissions was estimated for each gender,
age group, and McCabe score category by converting the stratum-specific prevalence rate from
the ECDC PPS into an incidence rate using the Rhame and Sudderth formula, I = P × LA/(LN
− INT). I (incidence) is the rate of new patients with HAIs per 100 admissions, P (prevalence)
is the percentage of patients with HAIs on the day of the PPS, LA is the length of stay of all hos-
pitalized patients (irrespective of the presence of an HAI), LN is the length of stay of patients
with an HAI, and INT is the length of stay before the onset of the HAI [23]. LN—INT, repre-
senting the length of stay of patients with HAIs from HAI onset until discharge, was derived
from the median number of days from HAI onset until the day of the PPS. This choice was
based on the fact that the average length of stay for all patients (as derived from the hospital
data) in the ECDC PPS was best correlated with the median length of stay of patients included
on the day of the PPS [6], as patients with a longer stay are overrepresented in any PPS sample.
The country-specificaverage length of stay of all hospitalized patients (LA) was extracted from
the ECDC PPS.
Under-reporting is a significant parameter affecting burden of disease estimates [24]. This is
also true for the reporting of HAIs in the ECDC PPS, in which a small validation study indi-
cated an average under-reporting factor of 1.25. This validation study was only performed in
four EU/EEA Member States and was therefore not deemed indicative of under-reporting of
HAIs in the whole EU/EEA. In the present study, we did not apply any correction factor adjust-
ing for underestimation of HAI incidence.
Computational Analysis and Uncertainty
The final designs of the HAI outcome trees, including their model parameters and uncertain-
ties, were inserted in the BCoDE toolkit [18]. For each type of HAI, three models were gener-
ated, and population and life expectancydata were customized to cover all EU/EEA
populations according to their McCabe score category. Successively, the gender-specific and
age-group-specificyearly numbers of cases of HAIs and uncertainties were inputted relatively
to each McCabe score category. Where applicable, inputs for disease model parameters and
HAI incidence data included uncertainty intervals, which were incorporated in the calculations
as uniform (two variables) or Project Evaluation and Review Techniques (PERT) (three vari-
ables) distributions [25]. See S1 Input for detailed age-group- and sex-specifictables inputted
in the BCoDE toolkit.
To calculate uncertainty intervals, the BCoDE toolkit models were run at 1,000 iterations of
the Monte Carlo simulations with and without a 3.5% annual time discount rate. The option of
discounting may allow for possible future comparisons with cost-effectivenessstudies on, for
example, interventions to prevent HAIs [26].
For each type of HAI, the outputs included the annual number of cases of HAIs, the HAI
incidence, the number of deaths attributable to HAIs, and the DALYs per case, as well as the
number and the rate per 100,000 population of YLLs, YLDs, and DALYs. For each output, the
median and the 95% uncertainty interval (95% UI) based on the input uncertainties were
calculated.
Results
Based on data from 2011–2012, we estimated that 2,609,911 (95% UI: 2,451,235–2,778,451)
new cases of HAI occur every year in the EU/EEA. These HAIs accounted for a total of
2,506,091 DALYs (95% UI: 2,163,850–2,877,574) annually in the EU/EEA, corresponding to

 501 DALYs per 100,000 general population (95% UI: 429–582). These DALYs consisted of 2
million YLLs (75% of total DALYs) and 681,400 YLDs.
When applying a 3.5% annual time discount rate, HAIs accounted for 1,335,159 DALYs
(95% UI: 1,153,291–1,536,343), corresponding to 261 DALYs per 100,000 general population
(95% UI: 226–301). The reduction of DALYs when applying time discounting occurred mainly
within the McCabe score 1 category.
For each type of HAI, the relationship between the incidence of HAIs, the number of deaths
attributable to HAIs, and the total burden of HAIs in DALYs per 100,000 general population
depends on the severity of disease and its long-term complications. This is illustrated by the
bubble chart presented in Fig 1.
As shown in this figure, HA primary BSIs, even with a relatively low incidence, generated a
high burden of disease due to their high attributable mortality, whereas SSIs that have a higher
incidence were associated with a lower burden of disease. More generally, the figure illustrates
how the ranking of HAIs may differ depending on which indicator is used for measuring their
health burden and therefore gives more detailed information on how different types of HAIs
compare in their burden on population health.
More than 60% of the total burden of the six selected HAIs was accounted for by HAP and
HA primary BSIs. When only considering the population at risk for HA neonatal sepsis, i.e.,
newborns (derived from the 2011–2012 average Eurostat number of births in the EU/EEA)
instead of the general population, the burden of HA neonatal sepsis rose from 16.8 DALYs per
100,000 general population to 1,592 DALYs per 100,000 newborns.Over 60% of the total
DALYs were due to the acute phase of the six HAIs, while the remaining DALYs were due to
the sequelae, regardless of time discounting.
The estimates of the burden of the six selected types of HAIs are presented in Table 1. The
detailed results for each type of HAI (without time discounting) are shown in S1 Output.
Fig 2 summarizes the burden of the six types of HAI expressed in annual DALYs per
100,000 general population, distributed between YLLs and YLDs.
A total of 91,130 deaths (95% UI: 76,117–107,883) each year in the EU/EEA were attribut-
able to the six selected HAIs. Fifty-six percent of the estimated attributable deaths were attrib-
utable to HAP and HA primary BSIs (Table 1). Sixty-five percent of the deaths attributable to
HAIs occurred in patients in the McCabe score 1 category, twenty-five percent in the McCabe
score 2 category, and ten percent in the McCabe score 3 category. This distribution was mainly
due to the large number of HAIs that occurredin patients with a McCabe score of 1 compared
to patients in other McCabe categories.
Table 2 describes the relative burden on female patients, patients aged less than 5 y, and
patients aged 65 y and above for each HAI and overall (including and excluding HAI neonatal
sepsis).
Figs 3 and 4 present the distribution of the burden of HAIs in DALYS per 100,000 total pop-
ulation by gender and by age group, without and with time discounting, respectively.
S1 Output provides detailed results for each HAI, as well as sensitivity analysis exploring the
effect of lower values of ranges for each disease model.
Discussion
To our knowledge, this study represents the first attempt to estimate the burden of HAIs
expressed in DALYs. Estimation of the burden of disease expressed in DALYs is a comprehen-
sive and evidence-basedapproach to evaluate the burden of a disease that can be used to
inform policy making in public health. The DALY is a composite measure that accounts not
only for the number of cases but also for the associated mortality and short-term and long-

 term disabilities that result from a disease. DALYs provide a more comprehensive view of the
burden of a disease, and the ranking of diseases according to DALYs is often different from the
ranking based on incidence (Fig 5).
Despite the fact that the population at risk for HAIs was limited to hospitalised patients, our
estimated total burden of HAIs in the EU/EEA of 501 DALYs per 100,000 general population
was significantly higher than that of other communicable diseases as estimated by the BCoDE
2009–2013 study [27]. In comparison, the total burden of all other communicable diseases
included in the BCoDE 2009–2013 study was 260 DALYs per 100,000 general population,
including influenza (71.2 DALYs per 100,000 general population) and tuberculosis (53.5
DALYs per 100,000 general population).
The syndromic approach that we selected for estimating the burden of HAIs may partly
explain this observation,and one should be cautious when making comparisons between infec-
tion syndromes and infections caused by specific microorganisms. However, this comparison
is indicative of the relative burden of HAIs on population health and on the use of healthcare
resources. Although HAIs are caused by various microorganisms and are associated with a
number of risks and causation pathways, the specific syndromes are well defined, and a sub-
stantial proportion of HAI cases are preventable by common infection prevention and control
measures.
HAP, including ventilator-associated pneumonia, and HA primary BSI were the HAIs with
the highest health burden measured in DALYs, representing 60% of the total burden of HAIs
under study. This is the result of a large number of cases combined with the severity of these

 HAIs. HA UTIs and HA SSIs represented almost 30% of the total burden of HAIs under study.
The fact that more than half of the cases of these four types of HAI are considered preventable
[1] and that the four cumulatively represent 90% of the burden of HAIs under study is an indi-
cation that lowering the burden of HAIs in the EU/EEA should be an achievable goal.

 HA neonatal sepsis accounted for 1,592 DALYs per 100,000 newborns (852–2,580), 12
times the DALYs of the congenital infections (congenital toxoplasmosis, congenital chlamydia
infections, congenital gonorrhoea, perinatal listeriosis, congenital rubella, and congenital syph-
ilis) included in the BCoDE 2009–2013 study.
YLLs represented almost 75% of the total DALYs, and over 60% of the DALYs were due to
the acute phase of the HAIs. This is due to the high in-hospital attributable mortality of HAIs
that occurs mostly in the acute phase, while long-term consequences of HAIs are comparatively

 less significant and less well defined. The latter may also be due to the relative lack of available
evidence.
Our estimates of the burden of HAIs in the EU/EEA must be placed in a broader perspec-
tive. The 2013 Global Burden of Disease (GBD 2013) estimated DALYs for a number of syn-
dromes other than HAIs [28]. By downloading GBD 2013 country-specificestimates from the
Global Health Data Exchange (GHDx) website and adding the number of DALYs in 2013, we
were able to estimate the EU/EEA burden of cardiovascular diseases (5,097 DALYs per 100,000
general population), lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) (392 DALYs per 100,000), neo-
natal sepsis (11.4 DALYs per 100,000), and diarrhoea (37 DALYs per 100,000). Our estimate of
the burden of HAP (169 DALYs per 100,000) was more than one third of the GBD 2013 bur-
den of all LRTIs. Our estimate of the burden of HA neonatal sepsis was 1.5 times higher than
that of neonatal sepsis reported by GBD 2013. However, GBD 2013 was a prevalence-based
study, and its results did not account for the projected future burden of disease. When dis-
counting our estimates, thus reducing the burden of long-term sequelae, we found that HA
neonatal sepsis from our study was almost half of that of neonatal sepsis in GBD 2013.
The Ontario Burden of Infectious Disease Study (ONBOIDS) used a methodologycompara-
ble to that of our study and estimated the burden of several syndromes including pneumonia,
septicaemia, and UTIs, but it did not limit itself to HA cases [29]. The resulting ranking of
infections according to their burden was similar to our study, with pneumonia and septicaemia
ranking first in terms of number of health-adjusted life years (HALYs), followed by UTIs.
Moreover, as in our study, YLLs accounted for the largest part of the burden of disease, and the
number of HALYs for C. difficile was surprisingly similar (27.2 HALYs per 100,000 general
population in ONBOIDS versus 31.2 DALYs per 100,000 in our study).
Among the studied types of HAI, HA neonatal sepsis and HA primary BSI had the highest
number of DALYs per case (12.1 and 8.0 DALYs per case, respectively), reflecting the severity
of these infections for each affected patient. By comparison, in BCoDE 2009–2013, HIV/AIDS
had 6.0 DALYs per case, invasive meningococcaldisease had 5.6 DALYs per case, and tubercu-
losis had 3.6 DALYs per case.
In general, the burden of HAIs was higher in men, except for HA neonatal sepsis, HA UTI,
and HA CDI, for which a higher proportion of the burden affected women. The fact that the
incidence of HA CDI was higher in female patients is consistent with another study [30] and
may be related to the higher incidence of HA CDI in elderly inpatients, a group in which female
patients predominate. HAP, HA UTI, HA CDI, and, in particular, SSI had a higher burden on
hospitalized patients aged 65 y and above, whereas HA primary BSI had a higher burden in
paediatric patients aged less than 5 y. When including HA neonatal sepsis, almost half of the
total burden of HAIs occurredin these more vulnerable population groups.
The present study was limited to HAIs in acute care settings. However, other studies indi-
cate that, when long-term care facilities are included, the total number of HAIs each year
approximately doubles [31]. Therefore, our results likely represent an underestimate of the
total burden of HAIs on healthcare systems in the EU/EEA.
One strength of this study is the availability of data from the ECDC PPS to estimate the
number of cases of HAIs in the EU/EEA. These data represent the most comprehensive assess-
ment to date of the epidemiology of HAIs in the EU/EEA. An additional strength is the use of
systematic literature reviews to determine attributable mortality, attributable length of hospital
stay, and attributable short-term and long-term complications of HAIs. Lastly, the use of the
McCabe score allowed adjustment of life expectancy, as a significant number of hospitalised
patients have decreased life expectancycompared to the general population.
A number of limitations need to be taken into account when interpreting the results of this
study. The outcome trees were developed based on systematic literature reviews and expert

 group consultations. The quality of evidence used to calculate the transitional probabilities var-
ied as displayed in single study quality appraisals. For HA neonatal sepsis, we demonstrated by
applying the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evalua-
tion) methodologythat confidence in transitional probability estimates was also heterogeneous
[16]. Variability in the estimates of HAI outcomes, and especially the attributable fraction of
death associated with HAIs, was reflected in the range of the model parameters. Moreover, all
outcome trees, except the one developed for SSI, were not adjusted for age-specificrisks,
assuming common transition probabilities for all subgroups.
Outcome trees were built on available published evidence, and the resulting disease progres-
sion pathway may not always fully reflect the definition of a case of HAI. However, while
acknowledging that this might be a source of imprecision, the outcome trees were the best
available approximation.
In the case of HA UTI, the outcome tree was based on studies of catheter-associated UTI in
critically ill patients [32,33]. The diagnosis of HA UTI in these studies relied on bacteriuria.
However, according to the surveillancedefinition for HA UTI used in the ECDC PPS [11],
only symptomatic bacteriuria is considered a UTI. We estimated the transitional probability
from symptomatic UTI to bacteraemia/urosepsisassuming that bacteraemia/urosepsisis more
common in patients with symptomatic UTI and using data on the probability of development
of symptomatic UTI in patients with catheter-associated bacteriuria [34]. This led to a four
times higher burden compared to the use of transitional probabilities from bacteriuria to bac-
teraemia/sepsis and illustrates the challenges of devising transitional probabilities for the esti-
mation of disease burden. A minor change of the interpretation of the source literature resulted
in a significant change of the result. The case fatality proportion estimated for the HA UTI
model of 0.5% to 4% indicates a 10-fold range of probability. This is reflected in the large UIs
around the results for the burden of HA UTI, as shown in Table 1.
An additional limitation is the uncertainty of using the Rhame and Sudderth formula for
estimation of the incidence of HAI from prevalence data. The Rhame and Sudderth method
was designed for and has been applied specificallyto HAI surveillance[35–37]. Although both
under- and overestimation have been describedwith the use of this method, it is the most com-
monly used formula for this purpose, and its use therefore allows for comparisons with the
results of similar studies.
Furthermore, we used Eurostat data for discharges of inpatients to calculate the total num-
ber of cases of HAI for each age group. Eurostat data are not fully comparable across EU/EEA
Member States because of differences of healthcare provision and of inclusion of various types
of healthcare facilities. However, for the majority of the countries, psychiatric, rehabilitation,
and long-term care facilities are not included, and the number of hospital discharges mainly
represent acute care hospitals. Thus, the inpatient population as defined in the Eurostat hospi-
tal discharges database is similar to the population of acute care hospitals studied in the ECDC
PPS.
We only studied six selected types of HAI. These were chosen because of their severity, per-
ceived burden, and availability of data. Other less frequent types of HAI—such as HA central
nervous system infections or HA head-and-neck infections, which represented 22% of HAIs in
the ECDC PPS—were not included. This may be a factor leading to an underestimation of the
total burden of HAIs in the EU/EEA.
We did not address the burden of HAIs specificallyassociated with antimicrobial resistance,
although multidrug-resistant microorganisms are often responsible for HAIs. The fraction of
the burden of HAIs attributable to antimicrobial resistance is currently unknown but is
expected to vary between EU/EEA Member States because of the large intercountry differences
in antimicrobial resistance percentages [38]. Higher antimicrobial resistance percentages likely

 lead to increased morbidity and mortality due to inappropriate and ineffective treatment. In
addition, the current increasing trends in antimicrobial resistance in bacteria responsible for
HAI such as Klebsiella pneumoniae or Acinetobacter spp. combined with the lack of new antibi-
otics active against these bacteria likely contribute to increasing an already high burden of
HAIs in the EU/EEA.
The present study highlights the substantial burden of HAIs in the EU/EEA, compared to
other communicable diseases under surveillancein the EU, and the need for intensified efforts
to prevent and control these infections, ultimately making European hospitals safer places.
