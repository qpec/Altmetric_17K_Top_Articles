Human breast cancer precursor cells remain to be elucidated. Using breast cancer gene product GT198
(PSMC3IP; alias TBPIP or Hop2) as a unique marker, we revealed the cellular identities of GT198 mutant cells in
humanbreast tumor stroma. GT198 is asteroid hormonereceptorcoactivator and acrucialfactor inDNA repair.
Germline mutations in GT198 are present in breast and ovarian cancer families. Somatic mutations inGT198 are
present in ovarian tumor stromal cells. Herein, we show that human breast tumor stromal cells carry GT198
somatic mutations and express cytoplasmic GT198 protein. GT198þ stromal cells share vascular smooth muscle
cell origin, including myoepithelial cells, adipocytes, capillary pericytes, and stromal fibroblasts. Frequent
GT198 mutations are associated with GT198þ tumor stroma but not with GT198� tumor cells. GT198þ pro-
genitor cells are mostly capillary pericytes. When tested in cultured cells, mutant GT198 induces vascular
endothelial growth factor promoter, and potentially promotes angiogenesis and adipogenesis. Our results
suggest that multiple lineages of breast tumor stromal cells are mutated in GT198. These findings imply the
presence of mutant progenitors, whereas their descendants, carrying the same GT198 mutations, are collec-
tivelyresponsibleforformingbreasttumormicroenvironment.GT198expressionis,therefore,aspecificmarker
of mutant breast tumor stroma and has the potential to facilitate diagnosis and targeted treatment of human
breast cancer. (Am J Pathol 2016, 186: 1340e1350; http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ajpath.2016.01.006)
Breast tumor stroma provides a microenvironment that stim-
ulates the growth of luminal epithelial tumor cells. Several
breast stromal components have been shown to be critical in
breast cancer
initiation. Myoepithelial cells
juxtaposed
between the surrounding stroma and luminal epithelium are
essential for the integrity of normal breast tissue and for the
maintenance of ductal architecture, including cell polarity.1e3
Myoepithelial cells are steroid hormone responsive,1,4,5
mediating signals required for normal ductal epithelium
growth and differentiation.1 In early-stage breast cancer,
myoepithelial cells serve as endogenous tumor suppressors
and their loss is accompanied by disrupted ductal structure and
disorganized luminal epithelial cells.6e8
Pericytes are another critical component in cancer initiation
because pericytes envelop the endothelial lining of vessels and
contain multipotent stem cells or progenitors.9e11 Pericytes are
also central to tumor angiogenesis.12,13 When altered, pericytes
potentially produce multiple lineages of altered stromal cells,
including adipocytes10,14 and fibroblasts.15,16 Adipocytes
produce endocrine, inflammatory, and angiogenic factors that
further
contribute
to
the
tissue
microenvironment.17,18
Increased fatty acid synthesis, stimulated by up-regulated
lipogenic genes, is considered one of the hallmarks of
cancer.19,20 However, the relationships among these stromal
components are not fully understood, and direct evidence
supporting a stromal component in breast cancer initiation is
still needed. In particular, the specific genetic defects in breast
cancer stroma driving cancer initiation are largely unclear.
In this study, using the breast and ovarian cancer gene

 alias TBPIP or Hop2) as a specific marker, we have identified
mutant cell populations in human breast tumor stroma that
harbor GT198 somatic mutations. GT198 protein is a steroid
hormone receptor coactivator regulating estrogen, androgen,
glucocorticoid, and progesterone receptor (PR)emediated
gene activation.21,22 GT198 also critically regulates homolo-
gous recombination in DNA repair.23e25 The genetic location
of the human GT198 gene is at chromosome 17q21, 470 Kb
from BRCA1, a locus that has been previously linked to breast
and ovarian cancer predisposition. Germline mutations in
GT198 have been identified in familial and early-onset breast
and ovarian cancer patients.26 A germline mutation in GT198
is also found in familial ovarian disease of XX female gonadal
dysgenesis.27 Somatic mutations in GT198 are prevalent in
sporadic fallopian tube and ovarian cancer, which result in
altered steroid hormone regulations.28,29 GT198 somatic mu-
tations in cancer are clustered in two mutation hotspots that
deregulate GT198 alternative splicing, resulting in the pro-
duction of a truncated protein isoform with constitutive ac-
tivity in gene activation.28 In human ovarian cancer, GT198 is
mutated in the hormone-producing luteinized theca cells in the
tumor stroma, causing hormone overproduction and GT198
cytoplasmic translocation.29 Because GT198 mutations induce
tumor-specific cytoplasmic GT198 expression, we reasoned
that mutant tumor stroma expressing cytoplasmic GT198 may
also reveal precursor lesions in human breast cancer.
Materials and Methods
Study Design and Human Breast Cancer Samples
Institutional Review Board approval from each institute was
obtained following institutional guidelines using deidentified
human breast cancer paraffin sections. Individual patient con-
sent was not required because no human subject was involved.
Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) sections (5 mm
thick) of human breast carcinomas and normal breast controls
were derived from the Indiana University School of Medicine
(Indianapolis, IN), Medical College of Georgia (Augusta, GA),
and Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University (Wuhan, China). In
addition, FFPE tumor microarrays (5 mm thick; 1.5 or 2.0 mm
in diameter) of breast cancers were purchased from Imgenex
Corp. (San Diego, CA) and US Biomax Inc. (Rockville, MD).
Pathology diagnosis of all samples was verified through his-
tological examination by pathologists (L.C. and L.K.). Breast
cancer tissues were screened by immunohistochemistry to
identify GT198þ reactive tumor stroma with cytoplasmic
GT198 expression. Selected eight cases of positive stroma were
subjected to DNA sequencing analysis to identify somatic
mutations in GT198 using serial cut adjacent sections. As
additional negative controls, mutation analysis was performed
in genomic DNA isolated from 12 frozen breast tumors derived
from Biochain Institute, Inc. (Hayward, CA) and in five breast
cancer cell lines (MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, ZR-75-1, MDA-
MB-436, and MDA-MB-468) originally derived from ATCC
(Manassas, VA).
Mutation Analysis
FFPE sections of breast tumor were deparaffinized through
xylene and 100% ethanol, and air dried. The entire GT198þ
tumor stroma containing at least 50% positive cells, identified
by immunohistochemistry in an adjacent slide, was removed
using a new razor blade and transferred to the tube. For smaller
areas of tumor stroma or tumor cells, laser capture microdis-
section was performed using a Pix-Cell II laser capture micro-
scope and CapSure macro LCM caps, according to the
manufacturer’s protocol (Arcturus Engineering, Carlsbad, CA).
Genomic DNA was isolated by DNeasy Tissue Kit reagents
(Qiagen,
Valencia,
CA).
DNA
samples
were
Sanger
sequencing analyzed from both directions with repeats in two
previously identified mutation hotspot sequences,28 at 50 un-
translated region (UTR) to exon 2 (c.-109C to c.103A) and at
the exon 4eintron 4 junction (c.265C to c.337þ116T). The
entire GT198 gene was not analyzed because of the fragmen-
tation of DNA in FFPE sections. Forward (F) and reverse (B)
primers are as follows: 50UTR-F, 50-GGGGTCGCTTTGCTC-
CTCCGGAA-30; intron 1-B, 50-CTACGGAGAGAAAGGC-
AGGGGA-30; intron 1-F, 50-CAGTGGGTGAGGAGGTCG-
GTTGA-30; exon 2-B, 50-AGTCCGTGTTCCCGCTGTA-
GGT-30; exon 4-F, 50-GTGAGTGATGCTGACCTTCAA-
GTC-30; and intron 4-B, 50-TACACAAAAGCCGTTAGTTA-
TCCT-30. Nucleotide numbering was based on the cDNA
reference sequence. To confirm sequencing signals, amplified
PCR products containing mutant alleles were cloned into
pGEM-T Easy TA cloning vector (Promega, Madison, WI).
Multiple clones were sequenced to detect mutant alleles. For
genomic DNA derived from frozen breast tumors and cancer
cell lines, Sanger sequencing was performed in the entire
GT198 gene (c.-131G to c.*316C), excluding the large intron 3
(c.225þ160A to c.226-96G).
Immunohistochemistry
Polyclonal antiserum against GT198 was previously prepared
in rabbits (Covance, Denver, PA).21 Affi-gel 10 affinity resins
were covalently cross-linked to his-tagged GT198 protein as
antigen for affinity purification of anti-GT198, according to
the manufacturer’s protocol (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). FFPE
breast tumor sections or tumor microarrays were deparaffi-
nized and dehydrated through xylene and ethanol series,
followed by antigen retrieval in 10 mmol/L sodium citrate
buffer, pH 6.0, containing 0.05% Triton at 90�C for 20 mi-
nutes. Anti-GT198 (1:200) was incubated at 4�C overnight.
Antibody binding was detected using biotinylated anti-rabbit
secondary antibody, followed by detecting reagents (Abcam,
Cambridge, MA). Sections were counterstained with hema-
toxylin. Immunohistochemistry staining was scored in iden-
tified GT198þ breast tumor stroma in four categories of
cells, including myoepithelial cells, adipocytes, perivascular
cells or pericytes, and fibroblasts. The presence of positive
cells was scored by the percentage in each category in 10%
increments. Scored data were graphed by scattergram using

Immunofluorescence
GT198 expression was first identified by immunohistochem-
istry in tumor stroma, and the adjacent sections were further
analyzed by immunofluorescence double staining. Paraffin-
embedded tissue sections were deparaffinized through xylene
and ethanol series, followed by antigen retrieval, as above.
Immunofluorescence double staining was performed in 1%
horse serum using rabbit anti-GT198 (1:200) and mouse anti-
CD44 (1:200, Ab-4, clone 156-3C11; Lab Vision Corp., Fre-
mont, CA), mouse anti-vascular endothelial growth factor
(VEGF; 1:200, sc-7269; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas,
TX), or mouse antiea-smooth muscle actin (1:200, A2547;
Sigma, St. Louis, MO). Secondary antibodies were anti-mouse
Alexa Fluor 488e and anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 594econjugated
antibodies (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Sections were counter-
stained with DAPI.
GFP Transfection and Oil Red O Staining in Mouse
Mammary Gland Primary Culture
Mouse mammary gland tissues from wild-type FVB mouse
were digested in 0.5 mg/mL collagenase IV in phosphate-
buffered saline at 37�C for 3 hours. Cells were cultured in
Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10%
fetal bovine serum, 2 mmol/L glutamine, 100 U/mL penicillin,
and 0.1 mg/mL streptomycin, and incubated in 5% CO2 at 37�C.
Attached surviving cells were transfected overnight in chamber
slides with green fluorescent protein (GFP)eGT198 (wild type,
1 to 217 amino acids) and GFP-mutant GT198 (126 to 217
amino acids) plasmids in pEGFP-C3 vector. For fluorescent
staining, transfected cells were methanol fixed, stained by anti-
VEGF and Alexa Fluor 594, and imaged for GFP in green and
VEGF in red. For oil red O staining, transfected cells were fixed
with 10% formalin, stained by oil red O, and imaged for GFP in
green and oil red O in red. Oil red O staining can be detected by
red fluorescence. Oil red Oestained transfected cells were also
hematoxylin counterstained and imaged by bright field micro-
scopy. Quantification of oil red O staining was performed by
transfection of GT198 or its mutant plasmids in a 24-well plate
for 8 days (n Z 6). Cells were oil red O stained and dissolved in
200 mL of 100% isopropanol, which was transferred to a
96-well clear plate and read at A500.
GFP Transfection and RT-PCR in MEF
Mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells were prepared using
C57BL/6 mouse embryos at embryonic day 14.5. Briefly, head
and internal organs were removed from the embryos which
were rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline after digestion in
0.05% trypsin/EDTA by pipetting. Cells were collected by
centrifugation after inactivation of trypsin by adding fresh
above Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium. For fluorescent
staining, GFP fusions of GT198 or mutant were transfected into
MEF cells in chamber slides and stained using the same pro-
tocol described above for markers of angiogenesis and adipo-
genesis. Marker antibodies used are as follows: von Willebrand
factor
(A0082;
Dako,
Carpinteria,
CA);
peroxisome
proliferator-activated receptor g (2430) and CCAAT-enhancer-
binding protein a (2295) (both from Cell Signaling Technol-
ogy, Danvers, MA); and VEGF (sc-7269), sterol regulatory
element-binding protein 1 (sc-366), and fatty acid synthase
(sc-715) (all from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX). For
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), freshly pre-
pared MEF cells were transfected overnight in a 6-well plate
with 0.5 or 2 mg of wild-type GT198 or mutant GT198 plas-
mids. Cell culture medium was collected for ELISA to measure
secreted VEGF protein. Briefly, a white 96-well plate was first
coated with 50 ng per well rabbit anti-VEGF as capture anti-
body (RB-9031; Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA), together
with 5 mg per well bovine serum albumin. The washed plate
was incubated with culture medium of transfected cells (250 mL
per well) for 16 hours at 4�C. VEGF binding was detected
by mouse anti-VEGF (1:1000, sc-7269) and horseradish per-
oxidaseeconjugated anti-mouse antibody (1:3000, 074-1807;
KPL, Gaithersburg, MD), following detection reagents. For
RT-PCR, RNA from the same 6-well transfected MEF cells
was isolated by Trizol and analyzed using a one-step RT-PCR
kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Mouse VEGF primers are as
follows: forward, F-exon1, 50-GGCCTCCGAAACCATGA-
ACTT-30; reverse, B-exon3, 50-GGGTACTCCTGGAAGA-
TGTC-30.
VEGF Promoter Luciferase Assay
Human VEGF promoter fragments (�1228 to 19, �1228 to
420, and �1970 to 19) were PCR amplified using normal
human genomic DNA as template (100 ng/100 mL; Clontech,
Mountain View, CA). The PCRs were optimized by adding the
QiagenQsolutiontoresolvehighGC-richsecondarystructures
in the VEGF promoter.30 Cloning primers with restriction
enzyme sites underlined were as follows: forward primers:
F1970,
50-GATTCCAAGCTTATCCCGTTCATCAGCCT-
AGAGCAT-30; F1228, 50-GATTCCAAGCTTATGAGTCT-
GGGCTTGGGCTGATAG-30; reverse primers: B19, 50-TT-
ACACCTCGAGCTGCCCCAAGCCTCCGCGATCCT-30;
and B420, 50-CGACACCTCGAGCACTTTGCCCCTGTCG-
CTTTCGCT-30. VEGF promoter fragments were inserted into
a promoter-less luciferase reporter pXP2 (HindIII-XhoI),
confirmed by restriction mapping and partial DNA sequencing.
For luciferase assays, CV-1 cells were maintained in above
Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium in 5% CO2 at 37�C. Cells
were transfected in triplicate in 24-well plates using Lipofectin
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) together with 0.1mg per well VEGF-
luciferase reporter plasmid and other plasmids at indicated
concentrations. Human GT198 (1-217), its mutant (126-217),
estrogen receptor a (ERa), and PR were in cytomegalovirus-
driven pcDNA3 vector. Mitogen-activated protein (MAP)

GT198 Expression in Myoepithelial Cells, Adipocytes,
Pericytes, and Fibroblasts of Human Breast Cancer Stroma
We have previously found cytoplasmic GT198 expres-
sion
in
mutant
ovarian
cancer
stromal
cells.29
To
identify precursor lesions in human breast cancer, we
analyzed GT198 cytoplasmic expression in a total of
249 cases of human breast cancer and 11 cases of
normal breast controls by immunohistochemistry (Figures 1,
AeE, and 2A). Although GT198 was absent in normal breast
tissue (Figure 1B), or nonreactive tumor stroma (Figure 1, C
and D), it was strongly expressed in focal reactive tumor stroma
(Figure 1E). Reactive breast tumor stroma is generally defined
by morphological and molecular criteria as early lesions
containing carcinoma in situ, with increased tumor-associated
fibroblasts, inflammation, and apoptosis.31,32 GT198þ cells
included myoepithelial cells that were gradually lost in devel-
oping carcinoma in situ (Figure 1, F and G). GT198þ cells also
included stromal fibroblasts (Figure 1H), and adipocytes in the
fat pad (Figure 1I). Significant angiogenesis was present in
GT198þ stroma, where capillary pericytes expressed GT198
(Figure 1J). In contrast to stromal cells, tumor cells derived from
the epithelial layer were largely absent of GT198 expression
(Figure 1K).
The above data indicate that GT198 is expressed in
stromal myoepithelial cells, adipocytes, perivascular cells or
pericytes, and fibroblasts in reactive breast tumor stroma.
Negative stroma is often juxtaposed to the tumor so that

 both reactive stroma and normal stroma are concurrently
present (Figure 1). Thus, GT198 expression is a specific
marker of reactive tumor stroma, which often contains
carcinoma in situ and increased angiogenesis.
GT198þ Perivascular Cells Are Abundant in Carcinoma
in Situ
In 249 cases of breast cancer analyzed, cytoplasmic GT198 was
present in tumor stroma of both ductal and lobular carcinomas
(Figure 2A). Carcinoma in situ showed the highest positive rate
(96%), suggesting that GT198 is associated with early lesions
(Figure 2A). Negative cases were more often observed in
advanced tumors lacking stromal cell populations. Hence, the
true-positive rates may potentially be even higher than reported
herein. When each of the four categories of positive cells was
analyzed, the GT198þ perivascular cell type was the most
significant (Figure 2B). In fact, GT198þ capillaries were the
most common feature identified in GT198þ tumor stroma. We
scored immunohistochemistry staining by percentage of posi-
tive cells in each cell type (Figure 2, C and D), with their
representative images shown in Figure 2E. When analyzed by
immunohistochemical scores, GT198þ perivascular cells also
displayed a significantly higher percentage than myoepithelial
cells, adipocytes, or fibroblasts (Figure 2C). In many cases, all
perivascular cells were positive in a given sample. When car-
cinoma in situ was compared with carcinoma, GT198þ peri-
vascular cells were significantly more abundant (Figure 2D),
whereas GT198þ adipocytes were not significantly different.
These data suggest that GT198þ perivascular cells are associ-
ated with early-stage breast cancer.
GT198þ Breast Cancer Stroma Harbors GT198 Somatic
Mutations
Cytoplasmic GT198 expression is previously found to be a
consequence of GT198 genetic mutations.26,28,29 We,
therefore, performed sequence analysis of positive breast
tumor stroma to identify GT198 mutations. We selected
eight positive cases and performed Sanger sequencing
spanning previously identified GT198 mutation hotspots
(Figure 3A).28 Mutations were identified in 7 (87.5%) of 8

 cases (Table 1). In Patient 1 (Figure 1), a GT198 somatic
mutation (c.71A>G) was identified in stroma but not in
microdissected tumor cells, suggesting the mutation was
somatic (Figure 3B). In a triple-negative ductal carcinoma
from Patient 2 (Supplemental Figure S1), a total of four
somatic mutations were identified in stromal cells but not
in tumor cells (Figure 3B and Table 1). Cloning and
analysis of mutant alleles showed that two alleles were
mutated, although each allele could be derived from a
subpopulation of mutant cells. As controls, we did not
detect any GT198 mutations in 12 frozen breast epithelial
tumors or in five breast cancer cell lines, including MCF-7,
MDA-MB-231, ZR-75-1, MDA-MB-436, and MDA-MB-
468, suggesting that epithelial tumor cells or their de-
rivatives lack GT198 mutations. GT198� epithelial tumor
cells likely have a distinct origin from GT198þ stromal
cells. Because Sanger sequencing requires a mutant cell
population carrying the same mutation to be detectable, our
observations also imply that multiple lineages of mutant
stromal cells are related and are possibly differentiated
from mutant common precursors carrying the initial mu-
tation. Our results indicate that GT198þ breast tumor
stromal cells carry GT198 somatic mutations.

mutations, we further analyzed the mutant tumor stroma

 progenitor marker, CD44, was double stained with GT198,
and GT198þ pericytes in capillaries were found to be
mostly CD44þ, whereas adipocytes and myoepithelial cells
had a few CD44þ cells (Figure 4A). In contrast, GT198þ
perivascular cells in a large blood vessel had no CD44þ
cells, suggesting that capillaries possess most of the
GT198þ progenitors. Because VEGF induces angiogenesis
with increased capillaries,33,34 we analyzed VEGF expres-
sion and found that VEGF was highly expressed in GT198þ
pericytes,
perivascular
cells,
and
some
adipocytes
(Figure 4A). By comparison, VEGF expression was absent
in most myoepithelial cells (Figure 4A). As controls, a-
smooth muscle actin, a marker for vascular smooth muscle
cell lineage, was expressed in all four cell types of interest
(Figure 4A). These results indicate that GT198þ progenitor
cells are mostly pericytes that express VEGF.
Mutant GT198 Induces VEGF Expression and Promotes
Adipogenesis
Mutations in GT198 have been previously observed in fallo-
pian tube and ovarian cancers that disrupt GT198 alternative
splicing.26,28,29
Various
splicing
mutations
led
to
the

identified in the present study are similarly located in se-
quences
that

splicing
(Figure 3A), and result in the same mutant GT198 protein. We
then tested whether mutant GT198 protein induces VEGF
expression using cell culture models. In mouse mammary
glandederived primary culture, GFP fusion GT198 and its
mutant were transiently transfected, and endogenous VEGF
expression was analyzed by immunofluorescence. The results
showed that the mutant, but not wild-type, GT198 induced a
high level of VEGF expression (Figure 4B). Although the
wild-type GT198 is expressed in the nucleus, the mutant is
known to cause condensed nuclei with its expression in both
nucleus and cytoplasm.28 In transfected cells expressing
mutant GT198, data clearly showed that nuclei were small,
GFP expression was spread into cytoplasm, VEGF was
induced, and adipogenesis was present, with the lipid droplets
stained by oil red O (Figure 4B and Supplemental Figure S2).
Bright field images also showed lipid droplets in mutant-
transfected cells (Figure 4B and Supplemental Figure S2).
When oil red O staining was quantified using isopropanol
extraction of stained transfected cells, a significant increase in

 staining was observed in cells expressing mutant GT198 than
vector control or wild-type GT198 (Figure 4C). These results
suggest that mutant GT198 protein induces VEGF expression
and also promotes adipogenesis.
To further confirm that mutant GT198 induces angio-
genesis and adipogenesis, we analyzed additional markers in
mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells, which have mul-
tipotent differentiation capacity. The data showed that
mutant GT198 induced expression of angiogenic markers

binding protein 1, and fatty acid synthase in MEF cells
(Figure 5A). Although wild-type GT198 also induced weak
VEGF expression, mutant GT198 potently induced all
markers tested. Because mutant GT198 is essentially a
C-terminal half of the wild-type protein, our results imply
that wild-type GT198 activity is likely regulated under
physiological conditions and cancer-specific mutant protein is
a constitutively activated form. To quantify VEGF expres-
sion, MEF cells were transfected using different concentra-
tions of wild-type or mutant GT198 plasmids. Secreted
VEGF protein in medium was measured by ELISA, and
VEGF mRNA expression by RT-PCR. Data suggested that
mutant GT198 was more potent than the wild-type in stim-
ulating VEGF protein and mRNA expression in MEF cells

 (Figure 5B). Together, our results indicate that mutant GT198
is capable of stimulating the expression of multiple angio-
genic and adipogenic markers.
Mutant GT198 Stimulates Human VEGF Promoter
Because mutant GT198 protein induced potent expression
of VEGF, we tested whether it stimulates VEGF promoter
transcriptional activity. Human VEGF promoter-luciferase
reporter constructs were prepared by cloning of VEGF
promoter fragments into a promoter-less luciferase vector
pXP2 (Figure 5C and Supplemental Figure S3). The human
VEGF transcripts exhibit extensive alternative splicing with
a long 50UTR and multiple translation start sites.35 We
tested cloned VEGF promoter fragments spanning �1970 to
19 and �1228 to 19, and also included 50UTR spanning
�1228 to 420 for its potential activity. The results showed
that mutant GT198 was more potent than the wild-type in
stimulating VEGF promoter, and the longer promoter was
more inducible by mutant GT198 (Figure 5D). Inclusion of
50UTR increased basal activity but diminished inductivity
(Figure 5D), implicating that 50UTR may participate in
promoter activation but not pertain to GT198 activation. The
induction by GT198 or its mutant was also dose dependent
when tested in the longer promoter (Figure 5E). We have
previously shown that MAP kinase can suppress wild-type
GT198 transcriptional activity.21 Herein, although MAP
kinase increased basal activity of VEGF promoter, MAP
kinase diminished GT198 induction, but not its mutant in-
duction (Figure 5F). These data further supported that
mutant GT198 escaped signaling regulations and was
constitutively active. When ERa and PR were tested by
cotransfections, PR, but not ERa, moderately enhanced
VEGF promoter activity (Figure 5G), which was consistent
with a previous report.36 Because the human VEGF pro-
moter is known to be regulated by a large number of cell-
specific factors, our results together indicate that GT198 is
one of the players in regulating human VEGF promoter, so
that active mutant GT198 may promote tumor angiogenesis
through stimulating VEGF promoter.
Discussion
Mounting evidence has shown that breast cancer stromal
cells may play an important role in cancer initiation.2,15,17
The most critical tumor stromal cell types implicated to
date include myoepithelial cells, adipocytes, pericytes, and
stromal fibroblasts. Finding the relationships among stromal
cell populations in highly heterogeneous tumor stroma re-
mains a challenge. In this study, using GT198 as a marker,
we provide critical evidence that breast tumor stromal cells
in a reactive stroma are related in that they express cyto-
plasmic GT198 protein and share genetic mutations in the
GT198 gene. More important, we show that mutant GT198þ
stromal cell populations are not homogeneous but distinct.
Mutant GT198þ myoepithelial cells, adipocytes, fibroblasts,
and their pericyte progenitors coexist. These cells poten-
tially belong to related lineages of adipogenic, myogenic, or
vascular smooth muscle cell origin.10 In a given tumor
stroma, mutant descendants carrying the same mutation can
be derived from precursor cells carrying the initial mutation,
and together constitute a focal reactive tumor stroma
(Figure 1E and Supplemental Figure S1). Not all stromal
cells in a given tumor are altered or mutated. Mutant and
normal stromal tissues can be juxtaposed. Thus, GT198 can
be a useful marker to specifically distinguish mutant reactive
tumor stromal cells from their normal counterparts.
A proposed hypothetical model of mutant GT198 is
shown in Figure 6. It was established that perivascular cells,
including capillary pericyte progenitors, are myogenic and
adipogenic.10 These cells have the capacity to differentiate
into adipocytes, stromal fibroblasts, and cells of vascular
Figure 6
Hypothetical model of mutant GT198 in breast cancer stroma.
GT198þ tumor stromal sells are depicted in red. Endothelial and luminal
epithelial tumor cells are depicted in blue. Potentially, GT198þ pericytes in
capillaries carry GT198 mutations. The mutant GT198þ pericytes differen-
tiate into adipocytes in fat pad, fibroblasts in stroma, and myoepithelial
cells lining luminal epithelium. The GT198þ cell populations yield a mutant
reactive tumor stoma overexpressing cytoplasmic GT198 protein shown in
the top panel in orange. The stimulated luminal epithelial cells, absence of
GT198 mutation, outgrow the stromal cells to produce breast tumor mass
shown in the bottom panel in blue.

 smooth muscle origin.9 Although a direct link between
perivascular and myoepithelial cells has not been confirmed,
both cell types are contractile and share a close functional
relationship. Our findings on multiple lineages of mutant
GT198þ stromal cells support this model, in which mutant
myoepithelial cells, adipocytes, and stromal fibroblasts are
potentially differentiated from mutant perivascular pro-
genitors, such as capillary pericytes, together generating
a mutant stroma as tumor microenvironment. In contrast,
luminal epithelial cells may be descended from a divergent
differentiation path than stromal cells, such that they are not
directly affected by GT198 mutations but can still be promoted
by molecular signaling from GT198 mutant stroma (Figure 6).
This altered breast cancer gene product in tumor stroma is
potentially a logical marker for identification of cancer pre-
cursor lesions, because few cancer genes have been found to be
extensively mutated in sporadic breast tumor stromal cells.
Evidence supporting GT198 as a critical breast and ovarian
cancereinducing gene includes the presence of germline mu-
tations in both breast and ovarian cancer families,26 recurrent
somatic mutations in sporadic ovarian and fallopian tube can-
cers,28,29 and somatic mutations in breast cancer, as described
in this study. In addition, GT198 is a critical DNA repair
gene,24,37,38 regulating steroid hormone-mediated gene activa-
tion,21 and is located in a breast cancer gene locus at chromo-
some 17q21.26 Together, these studies support that GT198 is a
new marker to reveal mutant precursor lesions in human breast
cancer.
Our findings are consistent with existing evidence on the
importance of tumor stromal cells. Angiogenesis in tumor
stroma and its occurrence before rapid tumor growth have
long been recognized.34,39 Increased VEGF is considered
central to angiogenesis.40 Antibodies against VEGF have
been shown to be therapeutically effective.41 VEGF is also
essential for angiogenesis in ovary because VEGF is asso-
ciated with ovarian theca cells and the corpus luteum,42,43
where GT198 is expressed.29 In this study, our data show
that mutant GT198þ pericytes in breast tumor stroma express
VEGF (Figure 4A), and mutant GT198 protein induces
VEGF expression (Figures 4B and 5). In addition, mutant
GT198 potently induced von Willebrand factor expression
(Figure 5A), which is a critical factor in vascular homeostasis
and angiogenesis, and its defect is associated with angio-
dysplasia.44,45 These results support that mutant GT198 in
tumor stroma promotes tumor angiogenesis. Furthermore,
adipogenesis is known to be induced by glucocorticoid
receptor ligand dexamethasone,46 and GT198 is a glucocorti-
coid receptor coactivator stimulating dexamethasone-induced
gene activation.21 Our data also show that mutant GT198
protein promotes the expression of several markers regulating
adipogenesis,
such
as
peroxisome
proliferator-activated
receptor g, CCAAT-enhancer-binding protein a, sterol regu-
latory element-binding protein 1, and fatty acid synthase
(Figure 5A),47 implicating a role of GT198 in meditating adi-
pogenesis in breast cancer. Moreover, our finding on GT198
expression in myoepithelial cells is in agreement with the
extensive observations of hormone-responsive myoepithelial
cells in breast cancer initiation,4,6 and loss of myoepithelium as
a hallmark of breast carcinoma in situ.1 Future studies on
GT198 target genes and altered steroid hormone response in
myoepithelial cells are needed, given that GT198 is a steroid
hormone receptor coactivator.21
In summary, we have revealed mutant tumor stromal cells
in human breast cancer using GT198 as a marker. Affected
tumor stromal cell populations include myoepithelial cells,
adipocytes, perivascular cells, capillary pericytes, and stro-
mal fibroblasts. The mutant GT198 protein induces VEGF
promoter and the expression of markers in angiogenesis and
adipogenesis. We suggest that GT198 expression is a spe-
cific marker to define mutant reactive breast cancer stroma.
GT198 has the potential to be a marker in early diagnosis
and targeted treatment of human breast cancer.
