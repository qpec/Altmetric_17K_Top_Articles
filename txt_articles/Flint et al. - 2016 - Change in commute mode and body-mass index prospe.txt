Change in commute mode and body-mass index: 
prospective, longitudinal evidence from UK Biobank
Ellen Flint, Elizabeth Webb, Steven Cummins
Summary
Background Insuffi
  cient physical activity is a determinant of obesity and cardiovascular disease. Active travel to work 
has declined in high-income countries in recent decades. We aimed to determine which socioeconomic and 
demographic characteristics predicted switching to or from active commuting, whether switching from passive to 
active commuting (or the reverse) independently predicts change in objectively measured body-mass index (BMI), 
and to ascertain whether any association is attenuated by socioeconomic, demographic, or behavioural factors.
Methods This study used longitudinal data from UK Biobank. Baseline data collection occurred at 22 centres between 
March, 2006, and July, 2010, with a repeat assessment at one centre (Stockport) between August, 2012, and June, 2013, 
for a subset of these participants. Height and weight were objectively measured at both timepoints. We included 
individuals present at both timepoints with complete data in the analytic sample. Participants were aged 40–69 years 
and commuted from home to a workplace on a regular basis at both baseline and follow-up. Two exposures were 
investigated: transition from car commuting to active or public transport commuting and transition from active or 
public transport to car commuting. Change in BMI between baseline and repeat assessment was the outcome of 
interest, assessed with bivariate and multivariate logistic regression models.
Findings 502 656 individuals provided baseline data, with 20 346 participating in the repeat assessment after a median 
of 4·4 years (IQR 3·7–4·9). 5861 individuals were present at both timepoints and had complete data for all analytic 
variables. Individuals who transitioned from car commuting at baseline to active or public transportation modes at 
follow-up had a decrease in BMI of –0·30 kg/m² (95% CI –0·47 to –0·13; p=0·0005). Conversely, individuals who 
transitioned from active commuting at baseline to car commuting at follow-up had a BMI increase of 0·32 kg/m² 
(0·13 to 0·50; p=0·008). These eff
 ects were not attenuated by adjustment for hypothesised confounders. Change in 
household income emerged as a determinant of commute mode transitions.
Interpretation Incorporation of increased levels of physical activity as part of the commute to work could reduce 
obesity among middle-aged adults in the UK.

Introduction
Mid-life is a key stage for the development of obesity 
and cardiovascular disease risk.1 In England, 78% of 
men and 65% of women aged 45–75 years are overweight 
or obese,1 and 44% of adults aged 55–64 years do not 
meet recommended levels of physical activity.2 In the 
past 50 years, mass adoption of private motorised 
transport and the modifi
 cation of built environments to 
facilitate car use has coincided with a decline in active 
travel and a rise in population prevalence of overweight 
and obesity. Laverty and colleagues3 reported that adults 
aged 50–65 years were 55% less likely to commute via 
public transport, 45% less likely to commute on foot, 
and 30% less likely to commute by bicycle than were 
16–29-year olds. The commute to work has been 
identifi
 ed by the UK National Institute for Health and 
Care Excellence (NICE) as a key intervention point.4 
In England and Wales, 23·7 million working-age 
individuals commute regularly to a workplace, with 67% 
travelling by car.5 For many, a transition to more active 
modes might be possible, without requiring un-
acceptable time or fi
 nancial costs.
Previous studies3,6–9 have found a strong, independent, 
cross-sectional association between active or public 
transport commuting and reduced obesity risk. Compared 
with car commuters, individuals who used active and 
public transport had lower body-mass indexes (BMIs) and 
percentage body fat, and lower rates of diagnosed diabetes 
and hypertension.3,6,7,9 A graded eff
 ect has also been found, 
whereby the magnitude of eff
 ect is greater across 
successively more active transport modes.9 However, a 
limitation of the evidence has been an overreliance on 
cross-sectional data, limiting causal inference. Martin 
and colleagues10 used longitudinal data from the British 
Household Panel Study to show that commuters who 
switched from car commuting to active or public modes 
experienced a signifi
 cant, independent reduction in 
self-reported BMI. Equally those who transitioned from 
active to car commuting reported a signifi
 cant increase in 
BMI. Mytton and colleagues11 used two waves of data from

the Commuting in Cambridge study to demonstrate that 
maintenance of cycle commuting was associated with 
lower BMI when compared with maintenance of sedentary 
commuting. However corroborative results were not 
found for walking.11 The protective eff
 ects of cycle 
commuting have also been reported for schoolchildren.12 
A Norwegian study13 showed that maintenance of active 
travel in pregnancy predicted lower gestational weight 
gain than switching to more sedentary modes. Much of 
the present evidence-base is hampered by reliance on 
self-reported height and weight, which are prone to bias.14 
Besides changing of residential or employment locations, 
evidence is lacking on what socioeconomic, demographic, 
and health-related factors predict transitions from car to 
active commuting, or vice versa.
In this study, we used longitudinal data from UK 
Biobank, a large population-based study of UK adults in 
mid-life, to investigate associations between changing 
commute mode and objective measures of BMI, and to 
identify the determinants of transitions to more active 
modes of commuting. We aimed to determine which 
socioeconomic and demographic characteristics predicted 
switching to or from active commuting, investigate whether 
switching from car to active commuting (or the reverse) 
independently predicts change in objectively measured 
BMI, and to ascertain whether any association is attenuated 
by socioeconomic, demographic, or behavioural factors.
Methods
Study design and data collection
We used survey data from UK Biobank (project 5935) to 
longitudinally study adults aged 40–69 years, selected via 
National Health Service (NHS) patient registers and 
recruited to 22 regional assessment centres. Biobank 
collected baseline data nationwide between March, 2006, 
and July, 2010. The project also did repeat assessment at a 
single location (Stockport UK Biobank Coordinating 
Centre) between August, 2012, and June, 2013, for a 
subset of these participants.
The sample of individuals who were present at both 
baseline and follow-up was refi
 ned to include only 
participants with complete data for all analytic variables 
at both timepoints. Four analytic samples were derived to 
address three objectives. For objective 1, we assessed 
individuals who had complete data for all hypothesised 
predictors and had either experienced a transition from 
car to active or public transport or conversely a transition 
from active or public transport to car commuting. For 
objective 2, we assessed individuals who experienced a 
transition from car to active or public transport or 
remained car commuters, and had complete data for all 
covariates. For objective 3, we assessed individuals who 
experienced a transition from active or public transport 
to car commuting or remained public or active transport 
users, and had complete data for all covariates.
UK Biobank has approval from the North West 
Multi-centre Research Ethics Committee, the Patient 
Information Advisory Group, and the Community 
Health Index Advisory Group. Further details on the 
rationale, study design, survey methods, data collection, 
and ethical approval are available elsewhere.15–18
Procedures
At both timepoints, participants were asked “what types 
of transport do you use to get to and from work?” and 
were able to select one or more of the following mode 
categories: car or motor vehicle, walk, public transport, 
or cycle. Responses were dichotomised to create a 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
Studies have repeatedly shown that active commuting to work 
contributes to greater overall physical activity and is associated 
with reduced body-mass index (BMI), percentage body fat, and 
risk of reporting hypertension and type 2 diabetes diagnoses. 
Previous work has shown a graded eff
 ect of active commuting 
on BMI, wherein greater magnitudes of association are 
observed across progressively more active transportation 
modes. However, much of the existing evidence base is 
hampered by cross-sectional study designs and self-reported 
health outcome data. These limitations make causality hard to 
establish, and accuracy diffi
  cult to ensure. Previous studies 
using longitudinal data have contributed valuable evidence by 
showing that BMI decreases as individuals transition to, or 
maintain, active commuting.
Added value of this study
This longitudinal study builds on these foundations by using 
objectively measured height and weight to derive an objective 
change in BMI outcome. The dataset, UK Biobank, allows for a 
focus on a lifecourse stage during which individuals are at 
particularly high risk for development of obesity and its 
behavioural risk factors: mid-life. The study shows that 
switching from more active (walking, cycling, or public 
transport) to more passive (car) commuting independently 
predicted a signifi
 cant increase in BMI of about 0·3 kg/m². 
Conversely, switching from passive to more active commuting 
signifi
 cantly and independently predicted a BMI decrease of the 
same magnitude. Change in household income was found to be 
the key driver of commute mode transitions.
Implications of all the available evidence
Active commuting is a signifi
 cant, independent determinant 
of bodyweight in mid-life. Public health policies that promote 
active travel to work, through encouragement of walking, 
cycling, and the use of public transport, could help prevent 
obesity in this critical period of the lifecourse (age 
40–69 years).

binary variable indicating whether the individual 
commuted solely by car, or by any other mode or mix of 
modes. This result was then used to derive two binary 
variables indicating whether the respondent had 
experienced one of the following transitions between 
baseline and repeat assessment: transition from car 
commuting to active or public transport commuting or 
transition from active or public transport to car 
commuting. These variables were used as outcome 
variables in the analyses for objective 1, and exposure 
variables for objectives 2 and 3.
Outcomes
Change in BMI between baseline and follow-up was 
the primary outcome for study objectives 2 and 3. 
Anthropometric measurements were taken by trained 
staff
  using standard procedures detailed elsewhere.18 
Height (measured using the Seca 202 stadiometer (Seca; 
Birmingham, UK) and weight (Tanita BC-418MA body 
composition analyser (Tanita; Amsterdam, Netherlands), 
was used to derive BMI via the standard formula. Change 
in BMI was calculated for each individual by subtracting 
BMI at baseline from BMI at follow-up.
Covariates
Factors hypothesised to confound the association 
between commute mode transition and BMI change 
were adjusted for in statistical analyses. They comprised 
both time-invariant factors (fi
 xed characteristics or 
baseline measurements) and time-varying factors 
(changes between baseline and follow-up). Hypothesised 
time-invariant confounders were age at baseline, sex,

Statistical analysis
The analytic sample size was large enough to produce 
reliable estimates of BMI change. We used descriptive 
analysis to identify the prevalence of switching from active 
to sedentary modes of commuting and to describe the 
distribution of other key variables. We fi
 tted separate 
bivariate logistic regression models to identify which 
socioeconomic, demographic, health, and behavioural 
factors predicted a transition to or from car commuting. To 
assess eff
 ects on BMI, we used two series of nested 
multivariate linear regression models to investigate the 
eff
 ects of switching from car commuting to active or public 
modes and to investigate the eff
 ects of switching from 
active or public commuting modes to car commuting. In 
each series of nested models, model 1 tested for a bivariate 
association between the commute transition exposure and 
the obesity outcome. Demographic and socioeconomic 
covariates were added for model 2 (baseline BMI, age, sex, 
ethnicity, baseline household income, household income 
change, and educational attainment). For the fi
 nal model 
(model 3), health, physical activity, and occupational 
covariates were added (self-rated general health transitions, 
manual occupation transitions, days per week of leisure 
moderate physical activity, and changes between baseline 
and follow-up, occupational physical activity transitions). 
All analyses were done with Stata/SE, version 14.

Results
502 656 adults were surveyed at baseline. 20 346 (21%) 
participated in the repeat assessment (median follow-up 
4·4 years [IQR 3·7–4·9]).18 5861 individuals had complete 
data for all analytic variables at both baseline and 
follow-up (table 1). For objective 1, 2993 individuals with 
complete data transitioned from car to active or public 
transport (table 2) and 1277 individuals with complete 
data transitioned from active or public transport to car 
commuting (table 2). For objective 2, 4126 individuals 
with compete covariate data transitioned from car to 
active or public transport or remained car commuters 
(table 3). For objective 3, 1735 individuals with compete 
covariate data transitioned from active or public transport 
to car commuting or remained public or active transport 
users (table 4).
3646 baseline car commuters remained car commuters 
at follow-up (table 1). However, 480 (8%) individuals 
switched to active or public modes of commuting. Of 
these individuals, 44 (9%) had switched from car to 
exclusive walking or cycling, with 436 (91%) using 
public transport for part of their journey. Conversely,

416 (7%) individuals who commuted by active public 
modes at baseline had switched to car commuting at 
follow-up. Of these, 33 (8%) switched from exclusive 
walking or cycling with the rest switching from public 
transport. 1319 individuals used active or public modes 
at both baseline and follow-up. 1011 (17%) of 5861 had a 
decline in their household income category between 
baseline and follow-up, while a similar proportion 
reported an increase (18%, table 1). Although 4421 (75%) 
reported good general health at both timepoints, 
616 (11%) had poor health at both timepoints and 
490 (8%) went from good to poor general health.
Only income was consistently associated with 
commuting mode transitions, for both sexes (table 2). 
Compared with individuals who remained in the same 
income category at both timepoints, respondents who 
experienced income loss were more likely to transition 
from car commuting to active or public modes 
(unadjusted OR 1·34, 95% CI 1·02–1·76; p=0·033). 
However, respondents who experienced income loss 
were also more likely to report a transition from active 
to public transport commuting to car travel compared 
with those who were active or public mode users at 
both timepoints (1·46, 1·04–2·05; p=0·0280). These 
results probably refl
 ect changes in occupation, which 
might explain both income category and commute 
mode. Indeed, experiencing an income category 
increase was also predictive of transitioning from 
active or public modes to car use (1·62, 1·17–2·24; 
p=0·0040).
The 480 individuals who switched from car commuting 
at baseline to active or public commuting modes at 
follow-up were compared with the 3646 individuals who 
remained car commuters at both timepoints (table 3). In 
the fully adjusted model, a transition to a more active 
commute was signifi
 cantly and independently predictive 
of a 0·30 kg/m² decrease in BMI (95% CI –0·47 to –0·13; 
p=0·0005).
The 416 individuals who switched from active or 
public commuting modes at baseline to car commuting 
at follow-up were compared with the 1319 individuals 
who reported commuting via active or public modes at 
both timepoints (table 4). In the fully adjusted model, 
experiencing a transition to car commuting was 
signifi
 cantly 
and 
independently 
predictive 
of 
a 
0·32 kg/m² increase in BMI (95% CI 0·13 to 0·50; 
p=0·0008). Adjustment for hypothesised time varying 
and time invariant confounders did not attenuate the 
eff
 ects of commute mode transition.
Discussion
In our comparison of BMI changes in middle-aged 
adults who switched mode of commute with their 
counterparts who maintained their mode of commute, 
individuals who transitioned from car commuting at 
baseline to using active or public modes at follow-up had 
an average BMI decrease of about 0·3 kg/m². This eff
 ect 
was not attenuated by adjustment for hypothesised 
demographic, socioeconomic, health, and behavioural 
confounders. The inverse eff
 ect was also found: 
individuals who transitioned from active or public modes 
at baseline to car commuting at follow-up typically had a 
BMI increase of about 0·3 kg/m². This eff
 ect was also 
independent of fi
 xed or changing demographic, 
socioeconomic, health, and behavioural factors. Of 
these factors, only income emerged as a consistent, 
independent predictor of commute mode transition. For

0·3 kg/m² is equivalent to a weight loss of approximately 
1·0 kg (2·2 lbs). For the average woman in the baseline

obesity 
guidelines19 suggested that for overweight adults, weight 
management interventions costing £100 or less per head 
are cost-eff
 ective for the NHS if they result in a 
maintained weight loss of at least 1 kg.
Most transitions reported here were between car use 
and public transport use, and vice versa. Previous 
cross-sectional studies have shown that compared with 
car commuting, public transport independently and 
signifi
 cantly predicts lower BMI, with similar eff
 ect sizes 
to active modes.3,6 However in previous work using 
cross-sectional data from UK Biobank’s baseline sample,9 
although public transport commuting predicted lower 
BMI than car use, cycling and to a lesser extent walking 
to work was associated with lower BMI scores than 
public transport. Therefore, fi
 ndings from the present 
study are probably an underestimation of the BMI 
decrease one would expect if it had been possible to 
model transitions between, for example, car commuting 
and cycle commuting. However this study adds strength 
to the argument that the incidental physical activity 
associated with the use of public transport, such as 
walking to and from transit stops, might play an 
important part in obesity prevention.
These results support and corroborate the fi
 ndings of 
Martin and colleagues10 in showing an independent, 
signifi
 cant association between switching between 
sedentary and active commute modes and BMI change 
in the British Household Panel Survey 2004–07
. Eff
 ect 
sizes are strikingly consistent: they found that switching 
from car to active or public transport commuting 
predicted a decrease in self-reported BMI of 0·32 kg/m² 
(95% CI –0·60 to –0·05). They also found that the 
opposite transition predicted a BMI increase of 
0·34 kg/m² (0·05 to 0·64). Together these two studies 
provide strong evidence for an association between 
active commuting and BMI.
Our study has strengths and limitations. UK Biobank 
is a high quality data resource that allows the use of 
objectively measured height and weight to provide 
unbiased BMI data. The comprehensive dataset also 
allows adjustment for a wide range of time-varying and 
time-invariant confounders. As randomised controlled 
trials are diffi
  cult to do in this area of research, 
longitudinal observational data might represent the 
best available evidence for policy development. 
However, the study is also subject to a range of 
limitations, many stemming from the relatively 
constrained sample size. First and foremost is the loss 
of nuance created by the need to combine active modes 
with public transport modes. This combination was 
attributable to the low prevalence of walking and 
cycling and the even lower incidence of transitions 
involving walkers and cyclists. Most respondents who 
switched from car commuting transitioned to public 
transport rather than to walking or cycling (and vice 
versa). The eff
 ect sizes reported in this study are 
therefore expected to be an underestimation of the 
likely BMI eff
 ects of transitions to walking or cycling. 
The necessary exclusion of commute distance from 
analyses is a limitation of this study, and a source of 
eff
 ect underestimation for long distance walkers or 
cyclists. The precise point at which a mode transition 
occurred is not known, and duration of exposure to a 
new commute mode is likely to be heterogeneous. As a 
result of these limitations, the precise eff
 ect sizes for 
the association between commute mode transitions 
and BMI change are subject to uncertainty.
Residual confounding by factors such as menopausal 
status, dietary energy intake, and physical activity might 
have occurred. Although we adjusted for leisure, 
occupational, and non-commute travel physical activity, 
these variables were self-reported and not comprehensive.
Thus, although this study benefi
 ts from the inclusion 
of an objectively measured health outcome, the use of a 
self-reported exposure is a limitation. Social desirability 
bias might lead to under-reporting of car commuting. 
However, individuals’ propensity to misreport mode is 
likely to remain relatively fi
 xed over time, strengthening 
the internal validity of the study.
The study is also subject to limitations stemming from 
attrition (mostly due to retirement) and missing data. 
Individuals who dropped out of the study could be 
systematically diff
 erent from those who contributed to 
both waves of data collection. By defi
 nition, sample 
members with data at both timepoints were in the 
Stockport assessment centre catchment area. This may 
limit the generalisability of results to this geographical 
area. Only 21% of those invited by UK Biobank to take 
part in the repeat assessment did so, as described in the 
UK Biobank Repeat Assessment documentation.18 
Furthermore, UK Biobank is not strictly representative 
of the UK mid-life population so results might not be 
fully generalisable.
This study shows that individuals who switched from 
car commuting to public transport or active modes 
experienced a decrease in BMI. This decrease was 
independent of changes in the socioeconomic, 
demographic, health, and behavioural factors observed 
over the same period. These fi
 ndings suggest that 
policies that enable and encourage the maintenance 
and uptake of commuting by more active modes such 
as public transportation, walking, or cycling could have 
an eff
 ect on obesity prevalence in this high-risk age 
group. Only 896 (15%) individuals in this study had 
a commute mode transition, suggesting untapped 
potential exists for interventions to facilitate uptake of 
active or public transport. Most individuals who 
 Articles

switched from car commuting transitioned to public 
transport. The eff
 ects observed in this study are 
therefore primarily related to mass transit and the 
benefi
 ts gained from the incidental physical activity 
associated with its use. Thus, this study is likely to 
underestimate the eff
 ects on BMI of walking or cycling 
to work. Eff
 orts to increase active travel to work through 
widening of access to mass transit systems and 
integrating them with opportunities for walking and 
cycling might represent an eff
 ective policy response to 
the obesity epidemic.
