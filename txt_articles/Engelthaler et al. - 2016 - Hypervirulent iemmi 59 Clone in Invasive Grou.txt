The hyper-virulent emm59 genotype of invasive group A 
Streptococcus was identified in northern Arizona in 2015. 
Eighteen isolates belonging to a genomic cluster grouped 
most closely with recently identified isolates in New Mexico. 
The continued transmission of emm59 in the southwestern 
United States poses a public health concern.
S
everal cases of invasive group A Streptococcus (GAS) 
disease were detected in January 2015 in a northern Ar-
izona hospital. A substantive percentage of the cases were 
associated with a homeless shelter and a local jail; outbreak 
case-patients were predominantly male and Native Ameri-
can. Other studies have shown an increase in infection risk 
for invasive GAS in Native American/First Nations popula-
tions (1,2), and outbreaks within this population in Arizona 
have been previously documented (3). Whole genome se-
quence analysis determined that the hypervirulent subtype 
emm59 was present among the first cases analyzed in early 
2015. emm59 is known to have caused a nationwide out-
break of invasive GAS in Canada during 2006–2009 (4,5), 
and cases and outbreaks have been reported in the United 
States (6–8).
The Study
We identified isolates for sequencing from 29 invasive 
GAS cases diagnosed in patients in a northern Arizona hos-
pital during January–July 2015 and randomly selected an 
 
additional 99 GAS isolates from a repository of >2,000 Ari-
zona GAS isolates collected during 2002–2006 (no isolates 
from patients in Arizona were available for 2007–2014). 
Four additional isolates from central Arizona identified in 
2015 were included in the analysis (online Technical Ap-
pendix Table, http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/EID/article/22/1/15-
1200-Techapp1.pdf). All isolates were grown on 5% 
sheep blood tryptic soy agar plates (Hardy Diagnostics, 
Santa Maria, CA), and incubated at 37°C with 5% CO2. 
DNA was extracted by using a DNeasy Blood and Tissue 
Kit (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA, USA) following manufac-
turer’s protocol. Genomic DNA libraries were prepared by 
using the Nextera XT library prep kit (Illumina, San Di-
ego, CA) and sequenced with paired-end reads (250 bp) 
on an Illumina MiSeq instrument, as previously described 
(9). The finished genome of the emm59 Canadian clone 
MGAS15252 (GenBank accession no. CP003116) and 
high-quality publicly available sequence-read data from 
44 US isolates, from NCBI short read archive (BioProject 
#PRJNA194066), were included in the subsequent phylo-
genetic analyses. The final core genome (all nucleotide loci 
found in all genomes) for single-nucleotide polymorphism 
(SNP) detection was 1,636,024 bp (98.6% of reference).
We used NASP SNP analysis pipeline (http://tgen-
north.github.io/NASP/) for whole-genome SNP typing as 
previously described (10). SNP matrices were developed 
for both the whole species and the emm59-only analyses. 
We used MEGA version 5.2.2 software (11) to generate 
maximum parsimony phylogenetic trees. Regions of high 
SNP density were identified as possible regions of recom-
bination and were further analyzed for impact on the con-
sistency index. Genomes were assembled by using UGAP 
(https://github.com/jasonsahl/UGAP). GAS emm subtypes 
were assigned by using BLAST (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.
nih.gov/Blast.cgi), querying the study genome assem-
blies against the Centers for Disease Control and Preven-
tion’s (CDC) emm type-specific sequence database (http://
www.cdc.gov/streplab/m-proteingene-typing.html). 
We 
resolved dual emm-type hits using CDC’s emm typing 
Sanger sequencing primers (http://www.cdc.gov/streplab/
protocol-emm-type.html) as a BLAST query and noting 
hit locations.
We identified 18 of the 29 contemporary northern 
Arizona isolates as subtype emm59; the remaining isolates

were composed of 6 additional emm types: emm1 (n = 2), 
emm5 (n = 2), emm58 (n = 1), emm81 (n = 2), emm83 (n 
= 1), emm89 (n = 2), and emm94 (n = 1). The 99 historical 
and 4 contemporary background Arizona isolates included 
25 distinct emm types (online Technical Appendix Table). 
No emm59 isolates were identified in this background set, 
and none had been previously reported in Arizona.
The 18 Arizona emm59 cases occurred during Janu-
ary–July 2015 (Table). An emm59-only phylogenetic 
analysis demonstrated the apparent presence of multiple 
lineages of emm59 in the 2015 Arizona isolates (Figure 1). 
A distinct clone consisting of 14 of the 18 emm59 isolates 
were separated from each other by only 0–4 SNPs, genomi-
cally supporting the presence of an ongoing outbreak; >8 
of these patients were epidemiologically linked to physi-
cal contact, cohabitation, or both with 1 other person (data 
not shown). The additional emm59 isolates make up addi-
tional lineages separated from one other by 8–28 SNPs. No 
recombination was identified among the Arizona isolates. 
A relatively large number of SNPs and indels were seen 
within an approximate 23-kilobase region (Figure 1). This 
region has been previously reported to contain mutational 
hotspots associated with virulence (12,13). Considering the 
presumptive positive selective force on this region, SNPs 
within the region were not included in the final phyloge-
netic analysis.
When compared with all other publicly available US 
emm59 isolate genomes, nearly all the genomes identified 
in the United States were closely related to each other and 
to the Canadian clone MGAS15252; individual isolate SNP 
branch lengths ranged from 0 to 10 (Figure 2). The Ari-
zona outbreak isolates were separated from 2 New Mexico 
isolates by 4 and 5 SNPs each; these isolates fell within 
the overall Arizona clade and were subsequently included

 Hypervirulent emm59 GAS Outbreaks, United States
in the Arizona-only phylogenetic analysis (Figure 1). Con-
versley, the isolate from patient M appears more distant 
from the larger Arizona population. The Arizona clades, 
with the exception of that of the isolate from patient M, all 
appear to arise from the large Minnesota polytomy. The 
previously estimated 1.3–2.1 SNPs/year mutation rates for 
GAS (14,15) further support the Arizona outbreak as be-
ing caused by a single clone, likely originating from New 
Mexico and being spread over 6–12 months.
Conclusions
The emm59 subtype of GAS, the etiologic agent of a sub-
stantial nationwide outbreak of invasive GAS in Canada 
during 2006–2009 (4), is now present in Arizona, causing 
at least 1 outbreak of epidemiologically and genomically 
linked cases and several additional epidemiologically un-
related cases. The lack of emm59 in background isolates in 
Arizona from the previous decade, along with its low genetic 
diversity, suggests that emm59 emerged recently in Arizo-
na. Following the emm59 epidemic in Canada, this subtype 
was subsequently seen in a few US states; a retrospective 
analyses of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
Active Bacterial Core surveillance (ABCs) system (http://
www.cdc.gov/abcs/reports-findings/survreports.pdf) iden-
tified 40 US emm59 isolates during 2000–2009 (6) and an 
additional 67 isolates during 2010–2012 (7). Of note, only 
5 (of the 40 emm59 isolates from 2000–2009 (2 from Min-
nesota, 2 from California, and 1 from Oregon) appeared 
to be closely related to the Canadian clone (defined by the 
authors as being separated by <16 SNPs) (6); in contrast, 
all of the strains from the 2010–2012 survey appeared to 
be more closely related to the Canadian clone. The more 
recent ABCs analysis identified an increasing number of 
southwestern isolates, including 4 from Colorado and 6 
from New Mexico (7), although no outbreaks were specifi-
cally described in these states (Arizona is not included in 
the ABCs system). Similar to this outbreak study, Olsen et 
al. (7), in an analysis of 60 MN emm59 isolates from case-
patients with identified race, determined that 25 (42%) were 
from Native Americans; of 5 isolates from New Mexico in 
that study, 3 were from Native Americans. 
Given the apparent distal nature of the Arizona/New 
Mexico isolates to the Minnesota population in our study, 
it is reasonable to propose an unidentified epidemiologic 
relationship between these case populations. However, 
caution must be used in drawing conclusions regarding 
the relationships of isolates from disparate geographic 
regions because only limited comparable sequence data 
from previous emm59 studies in the United States (7) were 
publicly available to compare to the Arizona isolates. Epi-
demiologic investigations, along with healthcare provider 
and patient education activities, are ongoing in Arizona to 
further determine the extent of the current outbreak and the 
associated risk factors and to help mitigate effects and limit 
or prevent further spread to at-risk populations.
