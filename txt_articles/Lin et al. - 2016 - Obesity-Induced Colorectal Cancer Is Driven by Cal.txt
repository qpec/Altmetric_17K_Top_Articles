Abstract
Obesity is a well-known risk factor for colorectal cancer but
precisely how it influences risks of malignancy remains unclear.
During colon cancer development in humans or animals,
attenuation of the colonic cell surface receptor guanylyl cyclase
C (GUCY2C) that occurs due to loss of its paracrine hormone
ligand guanylin contributes universally to malignant progres-
sion. In this study, we explored a link between obesity and
GUCY2C silencing in colorectal cancer. Using genetically engi-
neered mice on different diets, we found that diet-induced
obesity caused a loss of guanylin expression in the colon with
subsequent GUCY2C silencing, epithelial dysfunction, and
tumorigenesis. Mechanistic investigations revealed that obesity
reversibly silenced guanylin expression through calorie-depen-
dent induction of endoplasmic reticulum stress and the unfold-
ed protein response in intestinal epithelial cells. In transgenic
mice, enforcing specific expression of guanylin in intestinal
epithelial cells restored GUCY2C signaling, eliminating intes-
tinal tumors associated with a high calorie diet. Our findings
show how caloric suppression of the guanylin–GUCY2C sig-
naling axis links obesity to negation of a universal tumor
suppressor pathway in colorectal cancer, suggesting an oppor-
tunity to prevent colorectal cancer in obese patients through
hormone replacement with the FDA-approved oral GUCY2C
ligand linaclotide. Cancer Res; 76(2); 339–46. �2016 AACR.
Introduction
The precise molecular mechanisms by which obesity influ-
ences neoplastic transformation, including colorectal cancer,
continue to be one of the most perplexing and provocative
questions in cancer research. In that context, how obesity
influences canonical signaling pathways underlying tumorigen-
esis
remains
incompletely
defined.
Guanylyl
cyclase
C
(GUCY2C), expressed selectively in intestinal epithelial cells,
is the receptor for diarrheagenic bacterial heat-stable enterotox-
ins and the gut paracrine hormones, guanylin in colon and
uroguanylin in small intestine (1). This paracrine axis comprises
a tumor-suppressing circuit whose dysregulation universally
characterizes colorectal carcinogenesis across species (2, 3).
Indeed, guanylin is one of the most commonly lost gene
products in colorectal tumorigenesis and its loss is one of the
earliest events in intestinal transformation (2, 4, 5). Loss of
guanylin silences GUCY2C producing intestinal epithelial dys-
function disrupting homeostatic mechanisms organizing the
crypt–villus axis, including proliferation, DNA damage sensing
and repair, and metabolic programming, which contributes to
tumorigenesis (6–8). Here, we demonstrate that diet-induced
obesity suppresses guanylin expression and silences GUCY2C
through calorie-dependent endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress,
contributing to tumorigenesis.
Materials and Methods
Animal models
C57BL/6 mice were purchased from the NCI, whereas Balb/c
(stock number 000651) and ob/ob (B6.Cg-Lepob/J; stock number
000632) mice were purchased from JAX. Mice were acquired at 4
weeks of age, acclimated for 2 weeks, and fed Lean diet (LabDiet
5010; 3.0 kcal/g, 12.7% from fat and 58.5% from carbohydrate),
high-fat (HF) diet (TestDiet 58Y1; 5.1 kcal/g, 61.6% from fat
and 20.3% from carbohydrate) or high-carbohydrate (HC) diet
(TestDiet 58Y2; 3.8 kcal/g, 10.2% from fat and 71.8% from
carbohydrate) as indicated (Supplementary Table S1). Prelim-
inary studies revealed that 4 to 6 weeks of a HF diet was required
to induce guanylin suppression. Gucy2c�/� mice, generated by
inserting a neomycin resistance gene into the first exon, were
bred, maintained, genotyped, and functionally characterized as
described (7). Sibling Gucy2cþ/þ and Gucy2c�/� mice from five

 backcrossing to the C57BL/6J mice obtained from JAX (stock
number 000664)] were used to generate mice for the experi-
ments. ROSA-STOPflox-Guca2a mice were generated by standard
procedures in the Thomas Jefferson University transgenic mouse
facility as described (9). Expression of the GUCY2C ligand,
guanylin (GUCA2A), is regulated by the ROSA26 promoter
followed by a STOP codon flanked by two loxP sites upstream
of full-length Guca2a in ROSA-STOPflox-Guca2a mice (Fig. 4A).
Removal of the STOP codon by Cre recombinase activates
constitutive transcription of Guca2a driven by the ROSA26
promoter (Fig. 4A). The murine villin promoter targets stable
and homogeneous expression of transgenes in small and large
intestine along the crypt-villus axis, in differentiated enterocytes,
as well as in the immature, undifferentiated cells of the crypt.
Villin-Cre-ERT2 mice were obtained from S. Robine (Institut
Curie, Paris, France). Villin-CreERT2 mice express Cre recombi-
nase in intestinal epithelial cells. Intraperitoneal injection of
tamoxifen (20 mg/kg body weight [BW]) for five consecutive
days activates CreERT2 to mediate genetic recombination. Villin-
CreERT2 mice were crossed with ROSA-STOPflox-Guca2a mice to
generate hemizygous ROSA-STOPflox-Guca2a-vil-Cre-ERT2 mice.
Villin-CreERT2 mice were paired with hemizygous ROSA-STOP-
flox-Guca2a-vil-Cre-ERT2 mice to produce ROSA-STOPflox-Guca2a-
vil-Cre-ERT2 mice and corresponding littermate controls lacking
the ROSA-STOPflox-Guca2a transgene. Both Villin-CreERT2 and
ROSA-STOPflox-Guca2a mice were on the C57BL/6 background.
Xbp1DIEC (Villin-Creþ-Xbp1fl/fl) mice were generated by breeding
Xbp1fl/fl and Villin-Cre mice. Xbp1fl/fl mice were generated by
targeting loxP sites to introns flanking exon 2 and backcrossed
more than eight generations onto C57BL6 mice (10). Xbp1fl/fl
mice served as genotype controls (11). Mice were housed
in light-cycled and climate-controlled barrier animal facilities
at the Thomas Jefferson University (C57BL/6J, Balb/c, ob/ob,
Gucy2c�/�,
ROSA-STOPflox-Guca2a-vil-Cre-ERT2,
and

the Thomas Jefferson University and Harvard University Animal
Care and Use Guidelines and approved animal protocols.

primers:
forward:
50-AGGTCATGACGTCACTGCTGGGCC-30;
reverse: 50-TGTCCAGTCCTTCCTCCACAG-30; neomycin: 50-GGT-

ATAGGTGG-
CAAG-30. Villin-Cre-ERT2 genotype was confirmed by PCR with
primers: forward: 50-GAAAATGCTTCTGTCCGTTTG-30; reverse: 50-
ATTGCTGTCACTTGGTCGTG-30 (9).
Colorectal tumorigenesis model
For Gucy2cþ/þ (Lean, HF) and Gucy2c�/� (Lean) mice, azox-
ymethane (AOM; 8 mg/kg; Sigma) was administrated to mice
(6 weeks old) through intraperitoneal injections weekly for 6
weeks. Tumors were enumerated and their sizes were quantified 8
weeks after the last AOM dose under a dissecting stereomicro-
scope by blinded analysis. Tumor burden per animal was calcu-
lated as the sum of the area (diameter2) of individual tumors (7).
For the ROSA-STOPflox-Guca2a-vil-Cre-ERT2 model and corre-
sponding controls (Fig. 4C), mice were on HF diet starting at
4 weeks of age. Tamoxifen (20 mg/kg i.p.) was administered every
4 weeks to enforce guanylin expression starting at 4 weeks until
tumor enumeration. Six doses of AOM (10 mg/kg) weekly were
administrated starting at 5 weeks of age. Tumors were enumerated
and their sizes quantified at 22 weeks of age (6, 7). For the
Gucy2cþ/þ (Lean, HC) mice, AOM (12 mg/kg) was administrated
to mice (6 weeks old) weekly for 6 weeks. Tumors were enumer-
ated and their sizes quantified 12 weeks after the last AOM dose.
The doses of AOM in different diet models were established in
pilot studies to ensure at least approximately 50% tumor inci-
dence in experimental cohorts.
Human tissues
Human distal colonic mucosal specimens were obtained from
patients undergoing surgery under a protocol approved by the
Thomas Jefferson University Institutional Review Board (control
no. 01.0823).
Cell culture and lentivirus infection
Caco2 C2BBE1 cells were obtained from the ATCC (CRL-
2101), maintained and extended in DMEM (Cellgro, catalog
no. 10-013), supplemented with 0.01 mg/mL human transferrin,
and 10% FBS. HEK293T cells (ATCC, catalog no. ACS-4500)
were maintained in DMEM with 10% FBS. For PERK inhibitor
experiments, C2BBE1 cells were incubated in DMEM supple-
mented with 0.01 mg/mL human transferrin without FBS. Cells
were pretreated with 10 mg/mL PERK inhibitor I (GSK2606414,
EMD Millipore, catalog no. 506190) for 30 minutes before
induction of ER stress by 2.5 mg/mL tunicamycin (Sigma-Aldrich,
catalog no. T7765) for 24 hours. For ER stress experiments, cells
were treated with various concentration of tunicamycin, or
500 nmol/L thapsigargin (Sigma-Aldrich, catalog no. T9033),
for 24 and 48 hours before analysis. For siRNA experiments,
HEK293 cells were transfected with Stealth siRNA (Life Technol-
ogies), siPERK (HSS190343) or Negative Control siRNA (catalog
number 12935-300) using the Lipofectamine RNAimax Trans-
fection Reagent (Life Technologies). The next day, cells were
transfected with 0.5 mg of a bi-directional cytomegalovirus plas-
mid designed to co-express guanylin protein and a zsgreen
fluorescence marker using the FUGENE HD Transfection Reagent
(Promega). After 3 hours, cells were incubated in media contain-
ing 1 mg/mL tunicamycin or DMSO (control) for 24 hours and
then analyzed.
Tissue preparation
Mucosal layers from mouse distal colons were frozen imme-
diately in liquid nitrogen and stored at �80�C until protein or
RNA analysis. For immunostaining, specimens were fixed over-
night in 4% formaldehyde at 4�C, dehydrated through a series of
graded acetone and ethanol washes, and embedded in paraffin
(6, 7). Paraffin sections (5 mm) were mounted (5 sections/slide/
mouse) for IHC or immunofluorescence staining (7).
RNA analysis
Total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen,
catalog no. 74104), as per the manufacturer's instructions. Two-
step RT-PCR was performed using TaqMan Reverse Transcription
Reagents (Life Technologies, catalog no. N8080234) and TaqMan
Universal Master Mix (Life Technologies, catalog no. 4440038)
to perform qRT-PCR using GUCA2A primer/probe for TaqMan

method utilizing villin1 (Life Technologies, Mm00494146_m1,
Hs00200229_m1) as the internal control (9).
Immunostaining and immunofluorescence
Ki-67 served as a marker of proliferation, and IHC was
performed as described (7). Tissue specimens were deparaffi-
nized and rehydrated, followed by heat-induced epitope retriev-
al (10 mmol/L citrate buffer, pH 6.0). After quenching with 3%
H2O2 in TBS-T (Tris-buffered saline with 0.5% Tween 20) and
blocking with 5% milk in TBS-T, proliferative cells were detected
by overnight incubation with anti-Ki67 antibody (Dako, Clone
TEC-3, Code No. M7249), followed by biotin-labeled second-
ary antibody and Histostain IHC detection kit for visualization
(Life Technologies). Ki-67-positive cells were quantified by
blinded-analysis from 5 to 15 crypt-villus units/segment/
mouse. Crypt number was estimated from complete crypts per
transverse cross-section in five sections per mouse. Results
reflect means � SEM of at least 5 animals in each group. For
guanylin detection, heat-induced antigen retrieval was done in
10 mmol/L citrate buffer pH 8.5, blocked in 5% milk in TBS-T
supplemented with 3% donkey serum for 1 hour at room
temperature and followed by overnight incubation with rabbit
anti-guanylin antibody at 4�C (gift from Dr. Michael Goy,
University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC). Specimens
were mounted in ProLong Gold antifade reagent with DAPI
after incubation with fluorescence-labeled secondary antibody
(Alexa Flour, Life Technologies) for visualization. Fluorescence
was visualized using a Zeiss LSM 510 Meta Confocal Laser
Scanning Microscope. Intestine specimens from Xbp1DIEC and
control Xbp1fl/fl mice were obtained from Drs. F.M. Tomczak
and R.S. Blumberg (Division of Gastroenterology, Hepatology
and Endoscopy, the Biomedical Research Institute, Brigham and

Biotechnology. Staining intensity of specific bands quantified
by densitometry (Kodak) was normalized to that for villin-1.
Immunocomplexes were detected by SuperSignal West Dura
Substrate (Thermo Fisher Scientific, No. 37071). Average rela-
tive intensity reflects the mean of 5�15 individual animals per
cohort or �3 independent experiments with cells.
Growth curves and food intake
Five mice were housed together, each mouse was weighed
weekly, and at least 20 mice from each cohort were followed. In
the ob/ob restricted diet experiment, three mice were housed
together and six mice from each cohort were weighed. For food
intake, mice were separated into individual cages with wire-mesh
floors, and given a preweighed amount of chow each day. All mice
were given ad libitum access to water for the duration of the
experiment. Food consumption was measured daily for 7 days
to establish average food intake.
Statistical analyses
Minimum cohort sizes were computed using a power of 80%
and a significance level of 0.05 (one-tailed test) employing
a priori predictions of effect size and variance established by
preliminary studies or literature review. Operators were blinded
to sample identities for analyses. Comparisons between two
groups at single time points were analyzed by the Student t test,
or by the Mann–Whitney test for measures not satisfying nor-
mality assumptions, and comparisons between more than two
groups employed one-way ANOVA. All statistical tests were
calculated using GraphPad Prism. Analyses represent mean �
SEM of n ¼ 5, unless otherwise indicated, and �, P < 0.05; ��, P <
0.01;
���, P < 0.001;
����, P < 0.0001. The association of
hormone level with body mass index (BMI) in patients was
completed using a linear mixed model incorporating hetero-
skedastic variances aligned with BMI category. A global test of
mean differences across BMI levels was calculated, and differ-
ences in least squares means were used to assess differences for
BMI groups in relation to lean individuals.
Results
There is an inverse relationship between guanylin mRNA
expression in normal colonic epithelium and BMI in humans
(P < 0.001), and morbidly obese patients (BMI � 35 kg/m2)
exhibit an 80% decrease in guanylin mRNA expression com-
pared with lean individuals (Fig. 1A). Loss of guanylin mRNA
expression in obesity recapitulated guanylin loss in colon
tumors compared with matched normal adjacent tissues in
patients (12). Similarly, a HF diet reduced guanylin mRNA
expression in normal colon epithelia in mice (Fig. 1B), associ-
ated with reduced guanylin protein expression (Fig. 1C and D),
in proximal and distal colon (Supplementary Fig. S1), recapit-
ulating guanylin protein loss in colon tumors in patients (12).
Loss of guanylin expression in obesity silenced GUCY2C, with-
out changing its expression (Supplementary Fig. S2), eliminat-
ing canonical cyclic GMP-dependent phosphorylation of the
vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP) at serine 239
and increasing the expression of b-catenin (Fig. 1C). Beyond
b-catenin, silencing GUCY2C produced characteristic intestinal
epithelial dysfunction (6, 7, 13) increasing DNA damage
(g-H2AX); activating drivers of proliferation (AKT phosphory-
lation); accelerating the cell cycle (cyclin D1) increasing the
proliferating crypt compartment (Ki67); and reprogramming
metabolism by increasing the glycolytic machinery [hexokinase

 obesity recapitulated that induced by genetic elimination of
GUCY2C expression (Fig. 1F). Moreover, in an established
model of colon cancer in obesity (14), tumorigenesis induced
by an HF diet associated with guanylin suppression mimicked
that produced by genetic silencing of GUCY2C expression
(Fig. 1G and H).
The established paradigm suggests that tumorigenesis associat-
ed with diet-induced obesity reflects reprogramming of the endo-
crine, adipokine, and inflammatory milieu (14–16). However, a
HC diet that increased caloric intake by approximately 40%
(Supplementary Fig. S1A) without producing weight gain (Sup-
plementary Fig. S1B) reduced colon expression of guanylin
(Fig. 2A and B), induced epithelial dysfunction (Fig. 2B), and
amplified tumorigenesis (Fig. 2C) that recapitulated the effects of
an HF diet. Also, there is a phenotypic polymorphism in C57BL/6
mice in which about 20% consume excess calories (Supplemen-
tary Fig. S2A) but resist diet-induced obesity (Supplementary
Fig. S2B; ref. 17). These mice, which remain lean on an HF diet,
nevertheless lose guanylin mRNA (Supplementary Fig. S2C) and
protein expression associated with epithelial dysfunction marked
by increased b-catenin that recapitulates those effects produced in
obese mice (Fig. 2D). Similarly, although Balb/c mice are genet-
ically resistant to obesogenic diets and remain lean (Supplemen-
tary Fig. S3A and B; ref. 18), they lose guanylin expression on an HF
diet (Supplementary Fig. S3C). Further, ob/ob mice have a genetic
defect in leptin expression producing obesity even on a calorie-
restricted Lean diet (Supplementary Fig. S4A and B; ref. 19).
However, even in the context of obesity (Supplementary Fig.
S4B) consumption of a diet restricted to normal caloric intake
did not reduce guanylin expression or increase b-catenin in ob/ob
mice (Supplementary Fig. S4C and Fig. 2E). Finally, obese wild-
type mice on an HF diet recover colonic guanylin expression,
signaling, and b-catenin levels after 4 weeks on a Lean diet
(Fig. 2F), although they remain persistently obese (Supplementary
Fig. S5). Taken together, these observations demonstrate that
guanylin suppression, GUCY2C silencing, and epithelial dysfunc-
tion underlying intestinal tumorigenesis reflect the quantity of
ingested calories, rather than the type of calories, or the endocrine,
adipokine, and inflammatory milieu associated with obesity.
Ingesting excess calories induces ER stress associated with an
unfolded proteinresponsein extra-intestinal tissues (20,21). Here,
HF or HC diets induced colon ER stress in mice, increasing
canonical mRNA and protein markers of the unfolded protein
response (Fig. 3A and B; refs. 21, 22). In that context, ER stress
pharmacologically induced by tunicamycin or thapsigargin elim-
inated guanylin expression in Caco2 human colon cancer cells
in vitro (Fig. 3C and D). Similarly, intraperitoneal tunicamycin
induced ER stress associated with loss of guanylin expression
in mouse colon (Fig. 3E and F). Further, ER stress genetically
induced by eliminating expression of Xbp1 (10, 11), a key

 transcription factor mediating the unfolded protein response
(21, 22), almost completely abolished colon guanylin expression
(Fig. 3G and H). Conversely, blocking ER stress in mice on an
HF diet by oral supplementation with the chemical chaperone
taurodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA; ref. 23) reconstituted colonic
guanylin expression (Fig. 3I and J). Similarly, blocking the unfold-
ed protein response by pharmacologic (Fig. 3K) or genetic (Fig. 3L)
inhibition of PERK, an essential sensor of ER stress (22), restored
guanylin expression suppressed by tunicamycin in vitro. These
observations highlight the role of ER stress and the associated
unfolded protein response induced by ingested calories as one
mechanism suppressing the expression of guanylin in obesity.
The present observations suggest that colon tumorigenesis asso-
ciated with obesity reflects suppression of guanylin expression,
which silences the GUCY2C tumor suppressor by reversible calo-
rie-dependent induction of ER stress and the unfolded protein
response in colon epithelial cells. This hypothesis was directly tested
employing a genetic mouse model in which enforced guanylin
expression is induced selectively in intestinal epithelial cells (Fig. 4A;
ref. 7). Induction of transgenic guanylin expression overcame
endogenous guanylin suppression and GUCY2C silencing, recon-
stituting VASP phosphorylation, and normalizing b-catenin levels
in mice on an HF diet (Fig. 4B). Importantly, preventing the loss of
guanylin expression and maintaining GUCY2C signaling (Fig. 4C)
almost completely eliminated intestinal tumorigenesis associated
with obesity induced by an HF diet (Fig. 4D).
Discussion
Although essential molecular details linking energy balance
and cancer in any tissue have remained elusive, the present
study establishes a direct link between signaling pathways
underlying colon tumorigenesis and mechanisms directly
contributing to obesity. In that context, GUCY2C is a tumor
suppressing receptor whose silencing through loss of the
paracrine hormone guanylin universally contributes to epi-
thelial dysfunction underlying the initiation of sporadic colo-
rectal cancer (1, 2, 4, 6–8, 12, 13). Although loss of guanylin
mRNA and protein uniformly characterizes the earliest stages
of intestinal tumorigenesis (2, 4, 12), the precise molecular
mechanisms modulating hormone expression remain unde-
fined (1). Here, we reveal that one mechanism contributing
to guanylin suppression is the induction of ER stress and the
unfolded protein response (20–22). Although a role for
ER stress in intestinal tumorigenesis has been suggested
(24), its role in regulating guanylyl cyclase signaling within,
or outside, the intestine has not been recognized previously.
The prevailing paradigm suggests that intestinal tumorigenesis
related to obesity reflects dysregulation of the endocrine,
adipokine, and inflammatory milieu characterizing the asso-
ciated abnormal metabolic state (14–16). Surprisingly, this
study reveals that hormone suppression reflects ER stress

Guanylin expression is reversibly
suppressed by ingested calories. A,
HC and HF diets suppressed guanylin
mRNA in colon. B, HC diet reduced
guanylin and GUCY2C signaling,
increasing epithelial dysfunction. C,
mice fed an HC, compared with a Lean,
diet are more sensitive to AOM-
induced colon tumorigenesis. D, HF
diet reduced guanylin and GUCY2C
signaling, increasing epithelial
dysfunction, in mice resistant to diet-
induced obesity (HF-R). E, ob/ob on a
calorie-restricted diet (10 Kcal/day
per mouse) maintained guanylin
expression and GUCY2C signaling,
without epithelial dysfunction. F, diet
effects on guanylin expression,
GUCY2C signaling, and epithelial
dysfunction were reversed by
switching mice on an HF diet for
20 weeks to a Lean diet for 4 weeks
(HF-Lean). Immunoblot results

 (20, 21), rather than the abnormal metabolic state produced
by obesity. Indeed, ER stress and hormone suppression was
induced by hypercaloric nutrition in the absence of obesity in
mice on a HC diet, and in obesity-resistant Balb/c (17) and
C57BL/6 (18) mice. Conversely, caloric restriction even in
the context of obesity, reconstituted guanylin expression in
ob/ob (19) and C57BL/6 mice. These studies expand the estab-
lished mechanistic model, adding calorie-induced ER stress to
the constellation of processes contributing to tumorigenesis
in obesity.
Mechanistic insights provided here offer unique therapeutic
opportunities with immediate potential for clinical translation.
Indeed, as highlighted in this study, caloric suppression of
guanylin was reversible, even in the context of persistent
obesity. Additionally, conditional expression of guanylin by
intestinal epithelial cells that could not be suppressed by
hyperphagia and ingestion of excess calories almost completely
eliminated obesity-related colorectal cancer in mice. The chal-
lenges of lifestyle modification notwithstanding, these obser-
vations suggest that dietary modification in the form of caloric
restriction to reconstitute guanylin expression and GUCY2C
signaling may be an effective strategy to prevent colon cancer in
obesity. Further, although guanylin is suppressed in obesity, the
GUCY2C tumor suppressor is persistently expressed in apical
membranes of intestinal epithelial cells, directly accessible to
the lumenal compartment. These considerations suggest that
colon cancer in obesity could be prevented by oral ligand
supplementation, to replace hormone eliminated by calories
and ER stress and maintain the GUCY2C tumor suppressor
signaling axis. It is noteworthy that linaclotide, an oral

ER stress mediates guanylin suppression by ingested calories. A and B, HC diets induced the transcription (A) and translation (B) of markers of ER stress in
colon in C57BL/6 mice. C and D, ER stress induced by 2.5 mg/mL tunicamycin (TM) or 500 nmol/L thapsigargin (TSG) increased markers of ER stress and
suppressed guanylin in Caco2 cells. E and F, intraperitoneal administration of 1 mg/kg TM to C57BL/6 mice increased markers of ER stress and suppressed
guanylin expression in colon. G and H, colons from Xbp1DIEC mice exhibited reduced expression of guanylin (green) compared with wild-type (Xpbfl/fl)
mice (b-catenin, red). I and J, TUDCA (150 mg/kg by oral gavage for 12 days) relieved ER stress and rescued guanylin expression in C57BL/6 mice on
an HF diet. K, inhibition of PERK by GSK2606414 relieved ER stress and restored guanylin expression in Caco2 cells treated with tunicamycin. L, PERK siRNA
restored guanylin expression in HEK 293 cells treated with 1.0 mg/mL tunicamycin. In vitro results represent the mean � SEM of three independent
experiments performed in triplicate. In vivo results represent the mean � SEM of five mice unless otherwise indicated.

 GUCY2C ligand, received FDA approval for the treatment of
constipation-type irritable bowel syndrome (25). Moreover,
linaclotide recently entered clinical development through the
NCI Division of Chemoprevention for the oral prophylaxis of
colon cancer (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01950403).
Beyond the colorectum, there is an established epidemiologic
association between obesity and cancer in many tissues (26). In
that context, recent studies revealed an essential role for the
GUCY2C signaling axis in maintaining the intestinal epithelial
barrier, preventing systemic genotoxic insult associated with
extra-intestinal tumorigenesis (9). It is tempting to speculate
that caloric suppression of guanylin expression, silencing
GUCY2C, disrupts the intestinal epithelial barrier, producing
systemic genotoxic stress contributing to extra-intestinal tumor-
igenesis in obesity, which also could be prevented by oral
hormone supplementation.
