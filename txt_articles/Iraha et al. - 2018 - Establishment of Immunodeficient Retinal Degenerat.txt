SUMMARY
Increasing demand for clinical retinal degeneration therapies featuring human ESC/iPSC-derived retinal tissue and cells warrants proof-
of-concept studies. Here, we established two mouse models of end-stage retinal degeneration with immunodeficiency, NOG-rd1-2J and
NOG-rd10, and characterized disease progress and immunodeficient status. We also transplanted human ESC-derived retinal sheets into
NOG-rd1-2J and confirmed their long-term survival and maturation of the structured graft photoreceptor layer, without rejection or
tumorigenesis. We recorded light responses from the host ganglion cells using a multi-electrode array system; this result was consistent
with whole-mount immunostaining suggestive of host-graft synapse formation at the responding sites. This study demonstrates an appli-
cation of our mouse models and provides a proof of concept for the clinical use of human ESC-derived retinal sheets.
INTRODUCTION
Cell transplantation therapies using embryonic stem cell
(ESC) and induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived
retinal tissue (ESC/iPSC retina) or cells have emerged as
therapeutic options for retinal degeneration following
recent breakthroughs. A number of groups have shown
that transplantation of postnatal or ESC/iPSC-derived
photoreceptor precursor cells can integrate and restore vi-
sual function after transplantation into an adult mouse
model of retinal degeneration that retains the photore-
ceptor layer (outer nuclear layer [ONL]) (Lamba et al.,
2009; Pearson et al., 2012; Tucker et al., 2011), although
the mechanism by which photoreceptor function is
restored has recently been suggested as rescue of surviving
host cells by material transfer from donor cells, rather than
by direct cell integration (Pearson et al., 2016; Santos-Ferre-
ira et al., 2016a; Singh et al., 2016). Another breakthrough
was the introduction of a protocol for self-organizing three-
dimensional retinal differentiation from mouse ESCs
(mESCs) (Eiraku et al., 2011), which was successfully
adapted to human ESCs (hESCs) (Nakano et al., 2012)
and human iPSCs (hiPSCs) (Zhong et al., 2014). Since
then, in addition to the increasing number of reports that
mouse or hESC/iPSC-derived photoreceptor precursors
could integrate into, or transfer materials to, host ONL
(Decembrini et al., 2014; Gonzalez-Cordero et al., 2013;
Hambright et al., 2012; Santos-Ferreira et al., 2016b; Zhu
et al., 2017), we and others have reported that transplanted
ESC/iPSC retinal sheets or photoreceptors can make de novo
synaptic connections and restore some visual functions in
end-stage retinal degeneration models with no ONL struc-
ture (Assawachananont et al., 2014; Barnea-Cramer et al.,
2016; Mandai et al., 2017; Shirai et al., 2015).
Human ESCs take as long as 200 days to differentiate into
fully mature retina, which was presented by immunohis-
tology in monkeys and also by the presence of outer seg-
ments in nude rats following the transplantation (Shirai
et al., 2015). However, hESC retinal cells do not always
mature properly in xenograft rodent models, especially
when there is damage due to the surgical procedure (Ham-
bright et al., 2012). Although some researchers reported
successful transplantation of human cells in rodent
hosts with immunosuppression, graft survival was usually
monitored for a relatively short period such as within
several weeks (Barnea-Cramer et al., 2016). Even with

 immunosuppression, mild rejection can be observed that
may inhibit synaptic formation (Larsson et al., 2000). For
these reasons, SD-Foxn1 Tg(S334ter)3LavRrrc rats were
developed (Seiler et al., 2014, 2017), and we reported that
transplanted hESC retina developed an organized ONL
with potential synaptic connections to host bipolar cells
(Shirai et al., 2015). Although the SD-Foxn1 Tg(S334ter)
3LavRrrc rat is a good model for proof-of-concept studies
using human cells, mouse models for which abundant
phenotypic studies and gene expression databases are
available would be more desirable. Moreover, mice are
more accessible to genetic manipulations such as introduc-
tion of reporter genes. Recently, Zhu et al. (2017) reported
up to 9 months’ survival of transplanted hESC-derived
photoreceptors with some function in IL2Rg-deficient
CRX-mutant mice, but the possibility of material transfer
cannot be excluded due to the remaining host photorecep-
tors. Thus, immunodeficient end-stage retinal degenera-
tion mouse models with absent ONL structure would
be useful for preclinical studies featuring transplantation
of hESC/iPSC-derived cells and tissues.
In 2002, Ito et al. (2002) established an appropriate ani-
mal recipient model for xenotransplantation: non-obese
diabetes (NOD)/Shi-SCID, IL2Rgnull (NOG) mice. Charac-
teristics of NOG mice are as follows: (1) lack of T, B, and nat-
ural killer (NK) cells; (2) reduced function of macrophage
and dendritic cells; and (3) lack of complement activity.
This NOG mouse model has been used to study the human
lymphoid system by transplanting human cord blood-
derived hematopoietic stem cells, and is very useful for
testing the tumorigenicity of human cells (Kanemura
et al., 2014; Machida et al., 2009; Watanabe et al., 2011).
In this report, we established mouse models suitable
for human retinal cell transplantation by introducing
phosphodiesterase 6B (Pde6b) mutant allele from retinal
degeneration (rd) mouse models into NOG background.
Pde6brd1/rd1 (rd1) and Pde6brd10/rd10 (rd10) mice are well-
studied and frequently used animal models of retinal
degeneration with different degeneration speeds. The
missense point mutation in Pde6b carried in these mice is
also found as a causal gene of human autosomal recessive
retinitis pigmentosa (RP). Rd1 presents a phenotype of pro-
gressive retinal degeneration similar to that seen in C3H
and Pde6brd1-2J/rd1-2J (rd1-2J) mice, with the onset of photo-
receptor degeneration at around postnatal day 16 (P16),
and loss of photoreceptors within the first 3–4 postnatal
weeks (Chang et al., 2007; Kim et al., 2008). Rd10 exhibits
a slightly slower photoreceptor degeneration starting
between P16 and P20, and most of the photoreceptors
disappear by P60 (Pennesi et al., 2012).
We first characterized the degeneration phenotype in
these rd mice with NOG background because immune re-
sponses have been suggested to accompany or modulate
the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases (Cuenca
et al., 2014; Gonza
´lez et al., 2014; Jin et al., 2016; Noailles
et al., 2016; Yoshida et al., 2013a, 2013b; Zabel et al., 2016;
Zeng et al., 2005; Zhao et al., 2015). Rd1 mice in the back-
ground of SCID, or in combination with RAG-1 knockout
(no functional B and T cells) or a C1qa knockout (no func-
tional classical complement activation pathway) (Rohrer
et al., 2007) or NOD (no functional B and T cells and low
activity of NK cells) (Mishra et al., 2017) showed no differ-
ence in the degeneration speed, while rd10 mice with Ccr2
knockout (Guo et al., 2012) and Cx3cr1 knockout (Peng
et al., 2014) exhibited slower degeneration. We next trans-
planted hESC retinal sheets, to confirm the long-term
survival and functional integration of graft cells in NOG-
rd1-2J mice by immunohistochemistry and electrophysi-
ology recording.
RESULTS
Development of NOG-rd1-2J and NOG-rd10 Mice,
Retinal Degeneration Models with Severe
Immunodeficiency
We used marker-assisted breeding to develop immunodefi-
cient retinal degeneration mouse models for transplanta-
tion of hESC retina (summarized in Figure 1A; details
in Experimental Procedures). Using this marker-assisted
breeding, we were able to obtain two types of NOG-rd
transgenic
mice
within
a
relatively
short
period
of
420 days.
Optical coherence tomography (OCT) examination re-
vealed normal ONL thickness in NOG-Pde6brd/+ mice but
loss of ONL in NOG-Pde6brd/rd littermates at postnatal
week 8 (Figures 1B and 1C). Electroretinograms (ERGs)
showed detectable a and b waves in NOG-Pde6brd/+ mice;
however, no ERG responses to 2.0 log cd/m2/s stimulus
were recorded in NOG-Pde6brd/rd littermates (Figures 1D
and 1E). At postnatal week 12, immunohistochemical anal-
ysis showed indistinguishable ONL thickness between
NOG-Pde6b+/+ and NOG-Pde6brd1-2J/+, or NOG-Pde6b+/+
and
NOG-Pde6brd10/+
littermates,
whereas
the
ONL
was substantially thinner in NOG-Pde6brd1-2J/rd1-2J and
NOG-Pde6brd10/rd10 mice with no immunoreactivity to
rhodopsin (RHO) or cone opsins (OPN1MWand OPN1SW)
(Figures 1F and 1G). These results indicate that photore-
ceptor degeneration occurred in both of our newly gener-
ated mouse models. We also checked the spleen cells in
these four mouse lines (Figure S1). CD4+ cells (helper
T cells), CD8+ cells (cytotoxic T cells), CD19+ cells (B cells),
and NKp46+ cells (NK cells) showed markedly lower ratios
in spleen cells from both NOG-rd1-2J mice and NOG-rd10
mice compared with their counterparts from rd1-2J mice
and rd10 mice, confirming the immunodeficient state

 (e.g., lack of T cells, B cells, and NK cells) of these NOG-rd
mice. Interestingly, we also found enlarged populations
of CD11b+ cells (including monocytes, macrophages, and
microglia) in the spleens of both NOG mice, whereas the
spleen cells of both rd1-2J and rd10 mice had reduced pop-
ulations of these CD11b+ cells (Figure S1).
Earlier Degeneration Onset Observed in rd10 Mice
with NOG Background but Not in rd1-2J with NOG
Background
We performed immunohistochemical analyses to compare
degeneration time courses between rd1-2J and NOG-rd1-2J
mice (Figure 2A), or rd10 and NOG-rd10 mice (Figure 2B).
We evaluated the time courses of ONL loss using hierarchi-
cal Bayesian modeling (Figures S2A–S2C; see also Experi-
mental Procedures and Data S1). The ONL thickness was
not significantly different between rd1-2J and NOG-rd1-2J
at P7, P14, and P21, with distributions of estimated ONL
thickness nearly overlapping (Figures 2C and S2B; Table
S2). Many Iba-1 (AIF1)-positive microglia infiltrated at
P14 but mostly disappeared at P21 along with photore-
ceptor loss (Figure 2C), consistent with a previous report
(Zhao et al., 2015). In contrast, the ONL of NOG-rd10
mice was thinner than that of rd10 mice at P16, P23, and
P30, implying earlier degeneration in the NOG background
with concomitant microglia infiltration (Figures 2B and
2C). The timing of photoreceptor apoptosis was next as-
sessed in rd10; only a few TUNEL-positive apoptotic cells
were found in the ONL, with microglia limited to the inner
and outer plexiform layers (IPL/OPL) at P16 in rd10 mice

methods. The first generation (N1) was ob-
tained by in vitro fertilization (IVF) of male
rd mice and female NOD/Shi-scid, IL2Rgnull
(NOG) mice. Next, female N1 mice were
mated with male non-obese diabetes (NOD)
mice until we obtained the N5. Marker-as-
sisted selection with the microsatellite
markers was then performed to select the
mice closest to NOD strain. Finally, the
selected male mice and NOG females were
used for IVF to obtain the NOG line.

 and P12 in NOG-rd10 mice, followed by the dramatic in-
crease of TUNEL-positive cells in the ONL at P18 in rd10
mice and P14 in NOG-rd10 mice (Figure S3A). The ONL
thickness was reduced to less than half at P21 in rd10

This observation was consistent with the estimation that

available in Supplemental Experimental Procedures, Figure S2, and Data S1. Numbers of microglia found in the ONL at different time points
indicates NOG-rd10 mice tended to exhibit earlier microglia infiltration into the ONL than rd10 mice.

 immunoreactive for CD68, a lysosome-associated mem-
brane protein, suggesting their pro-inflammatory nature
(Figure 2D).
Since retinal degeneration is reported to be delayed in
dark-reared rd10 mice (Chang et al., 2007), retinal degener-
ation may have been accelerated by light in rd10 with NOG
background, as the NOG strain is albino and possibly more
susceptible to light. Indeed, animals raised in the dark from
day 17 of pregnancy showed delayed degeneration in both
NOG-rd10 and rd10, although the NOG strain still degener-
ated faster than the non-NOG strain (Figure S3B).
Absence of Immune Cells in Both NOG-rd and rd
Mouse Retinas
We next studied the influence of the immune system
upon retinal degeneration. Cytotoxic T cells, B cells, NK
cells, and neutrophils in the retina were stained with
anti-mouse CD8, CD19, NKp46 (NCR1), and LY6G anti-
bodies, respectively (Figure S3C). The staining revealed
no invasion by the aforementioned immune cells in the
retina from any of these mouse lines at around the peak
of retinal degeneration or inflammation (rd1-2J mice
and NOG-rd1-2J mice on P14, rd10 mice on P23, and
NOG-rd10 mice on P16).
In NOG-rd10, the expression of glial fibrillary acidic pro-
tein increased earlier than that of rd10, indicating the
activated status of Mu
¨ller cells during photoreceptor
degeneration, and the expression pattern was similar be-
tween rd1-2J and NOG-rd1-2J (Figure S3D).
Differentiation and Characterization of Human ESC-
Derived Retina
Retinal sheets for transplantation were prepared from
hESCs (Crx::venus line), which were consistently differen-
tiated into Crx::venus-positive retinas with a characteristic
continuous neural epithelium formed by differentiation
day 60 (DD60) (Figures 3A and 3B). These hESC retina
had a layer of retinal progenitor cells positive for both
PAX6 and Chx10 (VSX2) on the apical side with more
differentiated PAX6-positive/Chx10-negative cells on the
basal side (Figure 3C). Crx::venus-positive photoreceptor
progenitor cells were observed on the apical margins,
with some positive for the early photoreceptor marker Re-
coverin (RCVRN) and cone marker RxRg (RARG) (Figures
3D and 3E). The presence of early-born cells including
retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), amacrine cells, and horizon-
tal cells are also suggested by the Brn3 (POU4F1), Islet1
(ISL1), calretinin (CALB2), and calbindin (CALB1) immu-
noreactivities (Figures 3F–3H).
Long-Term Survival and Maturation of Transplanted
Human ESC-Derived Retina in NOG-rd1-2J Mice
Crx::venus hESC retinal sheets were transplanted at
DD64–DD66 into the subretinal space of 8-week-old
NOG-rd1-2J mouse eyes, which were collected for immu-
nohistology at DD200–DD220, as we previously observed
that hESC retina requires approximately 200 days to
mature (Shirai et al., 2015). Human nuclei (HuNu)-posi-
tive hESC retina presented ONL with mature cones and
rods as presented previously by us and others (Kaewkhaw
et
al.,
2016;
Shirai
et
al.,
2015);
Crx::venus-
and
rhodopsin-positive photoreceptors were in the organized
rosette
structures,
wherein
M/L
and
S
cone
opsins
were usually present in larger Crx::venus-positive cells
compared with rod photoreceptors, and localized at the
inner and outer segment (IS/OS)-like structures (Figures
4A–4D). These IS/OS-like structures were also positive for
peripherin-2 (PRPH2), a cell surface glycoprotein ex-
pressed in the OS (Figure 4E). We further characterized
the ultrastructure of graft photoreceptor cells by electron
microscopy and found components of mature photore-
ceptors such as mitochondria-rich IS, connecting cilia,
and OS disc structures that were often sectioned obliquely
(Figures 4F and 4G).
Other inner retinal cells were also present in transplants,
as suggested by the immunoreactivities against PKCa
(PRKCA, expressed exclusively in rod bipolar cells) and cal-
retinin (expressed in amacrine and ganglion cells) (Figures
S4A and S4B). Microglial cells of non-active ramified
morphology were observed in the host retina and the graft,
where they were often present inside the rosette of graft
photoreceptors (Figures S4C and S4C0). Electron micro-
scopy showed that these microglia were surrounded by ob-
lique sections of OS disc-like structures, and some fractions
of OS disc-like structures were engulfed by the microglia
(Figures S4E–S4E00).
(C) Retinal progenitor cells positive for VSX2 (Chx10, red) and PAX6 (gray) are present on the apical side, while differentiated cells (PAX6+/
VSX2�) are observed on the basal side.
(D and E) Crx::venus-positive cells are present on the apical side at DD60, with some of them co-labeled with (D) early photoreceptor
marker RCVRN (Recoverin, red) and (E) early cone marker RARG (RxRg, red).

(Figure S4D).
Graft-Driven Light Responses Recorded in Host Retinal
Neurons
Although rd1 mice exhibit severe retinal degeneration with
rod loss, cone cells can remain for weeks after rods have
completely degenerated. We tested whether NOG-rd1-2J
mouse retinas could elicit light responses at the time of
transplantation (postnatal week 8). These retinas showed
patchy, monolayered ONL and cone arrestin (ARR3) immu-
noreactivity in the distal retina but barely in the proximal
area, with a similar trend observed in 12-week-old NOG-
rd1-2J (Figure S5) retinas. We barely detected light re-
sponses from 8-week-old retinas (n = 4) but recorded a
few responses in some 12-week-old retinas (n = 4, Fig-
ure S5D), again indicating the variability in the degree of
cone degeneration. However, these responses were con-
strained to the distal retina, and no reaction was observed
in the proximal area, defined as the area within 1-mm dis-
tance from the optic nerve disc.
Light-responsive RGCs of transplanted retinas were
counted objectively and stringently, by only counting light
responses observed as the same responsive pattern at least
twice in the three repetitive recordings. Responses were
further classified into either ‘‘normal responses’’ (tran-
sient-, brisk-sustained-, or sustained-ON; transient OFF;
ON-OFF or sustained ON-OFF; ON suppression) or ‘‘hyper-
sensitive’’ (ON-hyperactive; OFF-hyperactive; delayed-hy-
peractive) responses as previously described (Mandai
et al., 2017). We previously reported that mouse iPSC
(miPSC) retinal tissue can elicit light responses in host
mouse RGCs (Mandai et al., 2017). In the present study,
eight retinas were tested for light responses to full-field light
stimuli at 12.84 log photons/cm2/s (0.45 log cd/m2/s,
the same condition as in our previous report) by multi-elec-
trode array (MEA) recording at 20–27 weeks after transplan-
tation (DD200–DD260). While some samples showed
none (3 of 8 retinas) or only weak or ambiguous light
responses (2 of 8 retinas), evident light responses were
recorded from three transplanted retinas in the proximal
area (Figures 5 and 6).
MEA recording of one responding retina is presented in
Figure 5 along with its corresponding in vivo images. At
DD176,
typical
Crx::venus-positive

with no inflammatory signs, such as increased vascular
permeability or leakage of fluorescein dye at the graft

(L-AP4; 20 mM) application (Figures 5B and 5C). Overall,
11 RGCs were recorded with ‘‘normal’’ responses (4 tran-
sient ON; 2 sustained ON-OFF; 2 brisk-sustained ON; 3 sus-
tained ON) and 13 RGCs with hypersensitive response
(13 ON-hypersensitive) after 9-cis-retinal replenishment.
In the presence of L-AP4, only 11 RGCs with hypersensi-
tive responses were detected (9 ON-hyperactive; 2 de-
layed-hyperactive).
After
washout,
normal
responses
were again detected in nine RGCs (4 transient ON;
2 brisk-sustained ON; 3 sustained ON) while 11 RGCs
showed hypersensitive responses (9 ON-hyperactive; 2 de-
layed-hyperactive) (Figure 5D). The ‘‘normal responses’’ as
clustered by our program resembled those of wild-type
RGCs in response to L-AP4, and increased along with
stimulus intensity changes, whereas some hypersensitive
responses did not change with or without L-AP4 (Fig-
ure 5E). The subsequent whole-mount immunostaining
strongly suggests the host RGC origin of ‘‘normal’’ light
responses over the mature graft area, where host bipolar
cell contacts with the graft photoreceptors are indicated
by RIBEYE staining (Figures 5F and 5G).
Two other samples that showed light-responsive RGC ac-
tivities indicative of graft origin are presented in Figure 6.
One sample showed clear light responses only after L-AP4
washout over the graft area (Figure 6A). The other sample
showed RGC responses even before 9-cis-retinal treatment,
and the number of light-responsive RGCs decreased upon
L-AP4
treatment
but
increased
again after
washout,
although classified as hypersensitive patterns (6 ON-hyper-
active) (Figure 6B).

 In two other samples, the number of light-responsive
RGCs was so few on the graft that we could not conclu-
sively determine the origin of the responses. In the rest
of the three samples only a small fraction of the graft
was laid on the electrodes, and no RGC responses were
detected.
To test whether NOG-rd1-2J mice are as adequate and
competent to accept retina transplants as rd1-2J mice in
our previous study, we also transplanted miPSC retina
(Nrl-GFP/ROSA:Nrl-CtBP2-tdTomato iPSC line) (Mandai
et al., 2017) at the same age as the hESC retina recipient
NOG-rd1-2J mice. After 5 weeks of transplantation, evident
microERG (mERG) responses were consistently recorded
over the graft area in all the transplanted samples as well
as typical RGC light responses sensitive to L-AP4 (n = 4)
(Figure 7).
DISCUSSION
In this study, we established two immunodeficient retinal
degeneration
model
mouse
strains,
NOG-rd1-2J
and
NOG-rd10, for transplantation of human retinal cells or tis-
sue. Initially, our goal was to obtain two model lines with
different degeneration speeds. However, degeneration
was unexpectedly fast in NOG-rd10 mice in comparison
with rd10 mice. In these NOG backgrounds, immune cells
such as T cells, B cells, and NK cells were markedly reduced,
whereas microglia were similarly present compared with
non-NOG mice. We did not observe infiltration of these
T, B, or NK cells in the retina during the photoreceptor
degeneration in either rd1-2J or rd10 mice, even though
these mouse lines both possess an intact immune system.
There are controversial reports about the role of microglia
in retinal degeneration (Arroba et al., 2011; Jin et al.,
2016; Peng et al., 2014). We observed microglia infiltration
into ONL after the detection of initial apoptosis marker
appearance in photoreceptor cells, both in NOG-rd10 and
rd10 mice. Although some reported that T cells could influ-
ence microglia to be neurotoxic or neurotrophic (Gonza
´lez
et al., 2014), the lack of Tcell infiltration argues against this
mechanism. The pro-inflammatory phenotype of micro-
glia indicated by CD68 staining was similarly observed in
both rd10 and NOG-rd10 mice. It was reported that
different inbred strains showed markedly different sensitiv-
ities to light (LaVail et al., 1987). Since retinas from dark-
reared rd10 mice exhibited delayed degeneration onset
while dark rearing had no effect on rd1-2J retinal degener-
ation (Chang et al., 2007), sensitivity to light may affect
the pathology of rd10 mice. In our study, since degenera-
tion in both rd10 and NOG-rd10 mice was slowed down
when dark-reared, in addition to light effect, the immuno-
deficiency
or
other
genetic
differences
between
the
different strain backgrounds may have also accelerated
the degeneration.
We experienced difficulties in observing maturation of
hESC retinas in rd1 mice even with immunosuppression,
but with NOG-rd1-2J mice the transplanted hESC retinas
consistently developed mature ONL with rod and cone
opsins. Furthermore, graft photoreceptors show signs of
developing IS/OS structures as evidenced by electron mi-
croscopy. However, we had not yet shown any function
by hESC/iPSC retina following transplantation. In the pre-
sent study, light-responsive RGC activities were detected
in 3 of 8 retinas over the grafts by MEA recording from
28-week-old or older NOG-rd1-2J mice (20 weeks or
more after transplantation). At such advanced stage of
retinal degeneration or even younger NOG-rd1-2J, no re-
maining cone activity was observed in the proximal retina
where the grafts usually lay. Although we could not
completely deny the rescue effect on the host’s remaining
cones by grafts, some of the light responses recorded after
transplantation were clearly distinguished by their prox-
imity to the disc and location directly over the graft.
These responses were not sparsely covering only a few
electrodes as in the non-transplanted retina but were de-
tected in clusters covering multiple electrodes directly in
the grafted area, suggesting that they are more likely
RGCs showing normal and hypersensitive responses, respectively. The proximal retina (<1 mm from disc) is indicated in pink, and the area
covered by the graft is shown in light green.
(D) Spatial distribution of the RGC numbers (spike sources) shown as normal (red bars) or hypersensitive (blue bars) in accordance with the
64 electrodes, ranging from 1 to 2 cells per channel. Electrodes covered by the graft are shown in yellow.
(E) Histogram of total RGC cluster numbers in electrodes covering grafted (on graft) or non-grafted (off graft) areas. RGC with normal
responses (red) in grafted areas increased along with stimulus intensity and were abolished in the presence of L-AP4. Hypersensitive
responses (blue) in non-grafted areas were insensitive to L-AP4. Stimulus intensities are shown in log photons/cm2/s.

 driven by the graft photoreceptors rather than remaining
cones.
Hypersensitive response patterns were initially observed
in the degenerating retinas, preferentially to a bright light
stimulus but barely with our regular light stimuli at 0.45
log cd/m2/s (Mandai et al., 2017). After transplantation,
however, many RGCs, usually located in and around the
grafted area, were classified as ‘‘light-responsive hypersensi-
tive’’ even to the regular light stimuli. Some of the hyper-
sensitive responses were rather ambiguous as they cannot
be clearly distinguished from the normal patterns, such
as whether to be sustained ON or ON-hyperactive. We pro-
pose that these patterns represent either degenerating or re-
generating processes and may possibly originate from the

 immature host-graft synaptic connections or cells associ-
ated with the circuitry formation. No OFF responses were
detected upon L-AP4 block, suggesting that the OFF
pathway may not yet have been recovered. The L-AP4-
insensitive hypersensitive activities may be partly derived
from intrinsically photosensitive RGCs, despite the use of
Opsinamide. Alternatively, these responses may suggest a
wrongly or immaturely rewired circuitry tethered to the
rather excitable RGCs in degenerating retina (Euler and
Schubert, 2015). It is noteworthy that we obtained light re-
sponses in one sample even before the 9-cis-retinal treat-
ment (Figure 6B), which indicates that graft photoreceptors
were readily functional with functional visual pigments
in vivo, even though the rosette formation dampens
normal contact with RPE cells.
In the present study, we did not detect full-field ERG
response after transplantation. Since detectable ERG
response is estimated to require more than 150,000-cell
integration (Pearson et al., 2012), our host-graft integra-
tion is not considered to be sufficient. However, consid-
ering that a patient with non-recordable full-field ERG
still has a limited visual field, the absence of in vivo full-
field ERG does not indicate total blindness. For the
ex vivo recording, although the evident mERGs were eli-
cited in miPSC retina grafts at 5 weeks after transplanta-
tion, we did not detect mERG in hESC retina grafts to
the same 10-ms flashlight (1/100 photons compared
with the multiunit recordings of RGC). Since the mERG
responses in miPSC were mostly abolished by L-AP4,
the wave components likely represented the postsynaptic
bipolar cells and RGCs of either graft or host rather than
the properly oriented photoreceptors of limited amount
inside the graft rossettes (Fujii et al., 2016). The lack of
mERG wave components but not RGC multiunit re-
sponses in hESC retina suggests that the graft photore-
ceptors did not convey a strong enough response to the
weaker stimulus. Still, we obtained RGC responses in 3
of 7 retinas with a substantial hESC transplant, which
suggests the presence of functional hESC retinal photore-
ceptors, although RGC responses were detected in all
samples
from
miPSC
retina-transplanted
NOG-rd1-2J
mice. The lower responsiveness of hESC retina compared
with miPSC retina in NOG-rd1-2J mice may be attributed
to (1) fewer functional photoreceptors in hESC retina
than in miPSC retina, (2) the advanced and aged host
environment at the time of synaptic integration of
hESC retinas, since hESC retina takes a longer time to
reach synaptogenesis stage than does miPSC retina, and
(3) inefficient synaptic formation in xenotransplantation
compared with allotransplantation as suggested by Laver
and Matsubara (2017). However, this incompatibility of
hESC/iPSC retina would not be an issue in human host
retinas. Finally, (4) the Crx::venus ESC graft we have
used here may have negatively affected synaptogenesis,
since functional maturation is reportedly delayed in
Crx+/� mice (Furukawa et al., 1999).
In summary, by introducing immune-deficient end-stage
rd mouse models, we were able to integrate hESC retinal
sheets
in
the
transplanted
retinas
for
an
extended
period. These grafts showed signs of photoreceptor matura-
tion
including
light-responsive
IS/OS
formation
and
synaptogenesis,
and
tentative
functional
integration
with host retina, albeit to an extent less than with
allotransplantation. This study supports the use of these an-
imals in preclinical studies, as well as the competency of
hESC retina for future clinical applications in RP patients.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
All animal experiments were conducted in accordance with local
guidelines and the ARVO statement on the use of animals in
ophthalmic and vision research. All experimental protocols were
approved by the committee of the RIKEN Center for Develop-
mental Biology.
Development of NOG-rd1-2J and NOG-rd10 Mice
To establish two types of NOG-rd transgenic mice, we used marker-
assisted screening methods (Figure 1A). Details are described,
with genotyping information, in Supplemental Experimental
Procedures.
hESC-Derived Retina Differentiation and Subretinal
Transplantation
Human ESCs (KhES-1 line) were cultured in accordance with the
hESC research guidelines of the Japanese government. The hESC
reporter line (Crx::venus) was maintained and differentiated as
previously described with a slight modification (Kuwahara et al.,
2017; Nakano et al., 2012; Shirai et al., 2015). Human ESC retinal
sheets were transplanted at DD64–DD66 as described previously
(Assawachananont et al., 2014; Shirai et al., 2015). Details are pro-
vided in Supplemental Experimental Procedures.
Details for animal sources and methods for in vivo electroretino-
gram and ocular imaging, electron microscopy, miPSC retina
transplantation, and immunohistochemistry with antibody infor-
mation are included in Supplemental Experimental Procedures.
