IMPORTANCE Polyneuropathy is one of the most common painful conditions managed within
general and specialty clinics. Neuropathic pain frequently leads to decisions about using
long-term opioid therapy. Understanding the association of long-term opioid use with
functional status, adverse outcomes, and mortality among patients with polyneuropathy
could influence disease-specific decisions about opioid treatment.
OBJECTIVES To quantify the prevalence of long-term opioid use among patients with
polyneuropathy and to assess the association of long-term opioid use with functional status,
adverse outcomes, and mortality.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A retrospective population-based cohort study was
conducted of prescriptions given to patients with polyneuropathy and to controls in
ambulatory practice between January 1, 2006, and December 31, 2010, to determine
exposure to long-term opioid use as well as other outcomes. The latest follow-up was
conducted through November 25, 2016.
EXPOSURES Long-term opioid therapy, defined by 1 or multiple consecutive opioid
prescriptions resulting in 90 continuous days or more of opioid use.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Prevalence of long-term opioid therapy among patients
with polyneuropathy and controls. Patient-reported functional status, documented adverse
outcomes, and mortality were compared between patients with polyneuropathy receiving
long-term opioid therapy (�90 days) and patients with polyneuropathy receiving shorter
durations of opioid therapy.
RESULTS Among the 2892 patients with polyneuropathy (1364 women and 1528 men; mean
[SD] age, 67.5 [16.6] years) and the 14 435 controls (6827 women and 7608 men; mean [SD]
age, 67.5 [16.5] years), patients with polyneuropathy received long-term opioids more often
than did controls (545 [18.8%] vs 780 [5.4%]). Patients with polyneuropathy who were
receiving long-term opioids had multiple functional status markers that were modestly
poorer even after adjusting for medical comorbidity, including increased reliance on gait aids
(adjusted odds ratio, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.4-2.6); no functional status markers were improved by
long-term use of opioids. Adverse outcomes were more common among patients with
polyneuropathy receiving long-term opioids, including depression (adjusted hazard ratio,
1.53; 95% CI, 1.29-1.82), opioid dependence (adjusted hazard ratio, 2.85; 95% CI, 1.54-5.47),
and opioid overdose (adjusted hazard ratio, 5.12; 95% CI, 1.63-19.62).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Polyneuropathy increased the likelihood of long-term opioid
therapy. Chronic pain itself cannot be ruled out as a source of worsened functional status
among patients receiving long-term opioid therapy. However, long-term opioid therapy did
not improve functional status but rather was associated with a higher risk of subsequent
opioid dependency and overdose.

pioids appear to be effective for the treatment of non-
cancer pain in short-duration trials,1,2 but the evi-
dence for long-term efficacy is less convincing.3-6 Opi-
oid therapy longer than 90 days is associated with a greater
likelihoodoflong-termopioiduse,7whichislinkedwithhigher
rates of opioid use disorders.8 Opioid prescription for chronic
noncancer pain continues to be the focus of efforts to curb the
opioid-related morbidity pandemic.9,10 Certain patient popu-
lations in legitimate need of pain relief may be more likely to
receive opioid therapy for 90 days or more; long-term out-
comes among such populations should be of interest.
Polyneuropathy is a common condition, especially among
the elderly, with well-described impairments in functional
status.11 Primary care physicians are involved not only in man-
agingtheunderlyingetiologicfactorsofpolyneuropathyfortheir
patients(eg,diabetes)butalsoinmanagingoneofitsmostcom-
mon symptoms, neuropathic pain. Opioids are listed by sev-
eral guidelines as second-line options for the treatment of neu-
ropathicpain,12-14andprimarycarephysiciansissuemostopioid
prescriptions.15 Understanding the benefits and limitations of
opioids can allow patients with polyneuropathy and their phy-
sicianstomakemoreinformeddecisions.Apreviousstudychar-
acterized a population-based cohort of patients with
polyneuropathy.11 In the present study, we used this longitudi-
nally followed cohort with comprehensive access to prescrip-
tions to determine the prevalence of long-term opioid therapy
among patients with polyneuropathy compared with matched
controls, and to examine the association between duration of
opioid therapy and functional status, adverse outcome rates,
and mortality among patients with polyneuropathy.
Methods
Health care visit dates are linked to addresses within the Roch-
esterEpidemiologyProject(REP)database;thisinformationhas
been used to define who resided in Olmsted County, Minne-
sota(REPCensus)atanytimesince1966.Thepopulationcounts
obtained by the REP Census exceed those obtained by the US
Census, indicating that virtually the entire population of the
county is captured by the system. We used the REP Census to
identify all individuals who resided in Olmsted County from
January 1, 2006, through December 31, 2010. Patients and con-
trols in this study have been reported previously.11 The Mayo
Clinic and Olmsted Medical Center institutional review boards
approved the study. Participants provided written consent.

torypracticeprofessionalsinthecountyisavailablestartingwith

ber of tablets or dose in milliliters), number of refills (if appli-
cable), and intended duration (in days). Whether or not each
patienthadbeenprescribedanonopioidanalgesic(α2Δantago-
nist,tricyclicantidepressant,serotoninnorepinephrinereuptake
inhibitor, or topical analgesic) during the study period was also
determined,aspreviouslydescribed.11Indicationforopioidpre-
scriptionsandtheprescribingclinician’
sspecialtyamongthose
receiving 90 or more consecutive days of opioid therapy were
obtained by reviewing clinical documentation around the time
thattheprescriptionwasissued.Administrativecodeandpatient
survey data were retrieved from an electronic database as pre-
viouslydescribed.11Depression,substanceabuse,overdose,and
chemical dependence were determined by International Clas-
sificationofDiseases,NinthRevision,ClinicalModification,codes
from 2006 to 2014 (eTable 1 in the Supplement).
All data fields were not available for every opioid prescrip-
tion. If an intended duration was specified, no expected dura-
tion was calculated. For calculating the expected duration, it
was assumed that every as-needed dose was taken and dosing
frequency was converted to doses per day. This conservatively
underestimatesthetotaldurationofopioidexposure.Expected
duration for each prescription (in days) was calculated as:
Duration = {[Amount Dispensed × (1 + Number of
Refills)]/(Dose)}/Doses per Day.
Extraction of data about prescriptions and calculated dura-
tion were done with automated algorithms and formulas to en-
sure uniform assessment. Data on duration were not avail-
able for all prescriptions. Because it was our goal to identify
duration of continuous opioid exposure, we excluded pre-
scriptions without sufficient data to identify duration.
Intervals of continuous opioid exposure were defined as
either the duration of a single prescription or the summed du-
rations of multiple prescriptions when there was less than or
equal to 10 days between the expected end date of 1 prescrip-
tion and the start date of the next prescription. Long-term opi-
oid therapy was defined as greater than or equal to 90 con-
tinuous days based on the length of use to treat chronic instead
of acute pain as defined by the International Association for
the Study of Pain.16
Key Points
Question What is the association of long-term opioid therapy
with functional status, adverse outcomes, and mortality among
patients with polyneuropathy?
Findings In this population-based cohort study that included data
from 1993 patients with polyneuropathy who were receiving
opioid therapy, those receiving long-term opioid therapy (�90
days) were significantly more likely to be diagnosed with
depression, opioid dependence, or opioid overdose than those
receiving shorter durations of opioid therapy. Self-reported
functional status measures were either unimproved or poorer
among those receiving long-term opioid therapy.
Meaning Long-term opioid therapy among patients with
polyneuropathy appears to increase the risk of adverse outcomes
without benefiting functional status.

 Statistical Analysis
All analyses were performed with JMP Pro, version 11.2.1, soft-
ware (SAS Institute Inc). Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% CIs were
calculated to compare differences in the rate of long-term opi-
oid therapy between cases and controls, as well as self-
reported markers of functional status between patients with
polyneuropathy receiving 90 days or more vs fewer than 90
days of opioids. Hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% CIs were used
to compare latencies of adverse outcomes (including mortal-
ity) after initiation of long-term opioid therapy. Multivariate

Results
Patients With Polyneuropathy and Long-term
Opioid Therapy
A total of 48 807 opioid prescriptions with complete data avail-
ablewereissuedto7906ofthe17 327patientscomprisingcases
and controls from a previously published cohort.11 The ex-
pected duration of opioid use had to be calculated for 42 564
of the prescriptions (87.2%); in the remainder, the prescriber’
s
intended duration was available in the REP database. Among
the 2892 patients with polyneuropathy, 1464 (50.6%) received
opioidsforfewerthan90days,while545(18.8%)receivedlong-
term opioid therapy (Table 1). This finding was significantly
higherthanthe780of14435controls(5.4%)whoreceivedlong-
term opioid therapy (OR, 2.4; 95% CI, 2.2-2.8), even after ad-
justing for Charlson Cormorbidity Index medical comorbidi-
ties(OR,1.7;95%CI,1.5-2.0).Oxycodonewasthemostcommon
opioid prescribed during the study period, accounting for 9333
ofthe20 333opioidprescriptions(45.9%)topatientswithpoly-
neuropathy (Table 1). Prescribing trends (in order from most to
least common) were fairly similar for patients with polyneu-
ropathy and controls, with some exceptions.
Long-term Opioid Therapy and Comorbidities
Prescription and comorbidity data were available in the REP
database for 1993 of 2009 patients with polyneuropathy who
were receiving opioids (99.2%) (Table 2). Patients with poly-
neuropathy receiving long-term opioid therapy were more
likely than those receiving opioid therapy for fewer than 90
days to be female (308 of 541 [56.9%] vs 674 of 1452 [46.4%];
P < .001), but there were no significant differences in median
age between the 2 groups (70 vs 69 years; P = .13) (Table 2).
Those receiving long-term opioid therapy had a significantly
higherlikelihoodofhavingaCharlsonComorbidityIndexmedi-
cal comorbidity, with the exception of paralysis, cancer, and
AIDS (Table 2). Excluding ulcers, we found that the rates of
lower limb complications were comparable between the 2
groups. Nonopioid analgesics were used more often among
patients with polyneuropathy receiving long-term opioids;
however, 111 of 541 patients with polyneuropathy receiving
long-term opioid therapy (20.5%) did not receive any of the
nonopioid analgesics prescribed during the study period.
Main Prescribers of and Indications
for Long-term Opioid Therapy
Abstraction of medical records identified the specialty of the
prescribing clinician and indication for 537 of the patients with
polyneuropathy receiving long-term opioid therapy (99.2%)
(eTable 2 in the Supplement). Internal medicine (373 [69.5%])
and family medicine (71 [13.2%]) were the most likely prescrib-
ers of long-term opioid therapy for patients with polyneuropa-
thy and controls, accounting for 444 of 537 of all opioid pre-
scriptions (82.7%). Pain specialists had clinical notes in the
medical charts of 141 of 537 patients with polyneuropathy re-
ceiving long-term opioid therapy (26.3%). However, only 20
patients with polyneuropathy (3.7%) received their prescrip-
tions for long-term opioid therapy from pain physicians. The
majority of patients with polyneuropathy (282 [52.5%]) were
prescribed opioids for musculoskeletal pain, as indicated by
the clinical documentation, whereas polyneuropathy was the
indication for only 129 patients with polyneuropathy (24.0%).
Other indications collectively made up less than one-fourth of
long-term opioid therapy prescribed during the study period.
Long-term Opioid Therapy and Worsening Functional Status
Patients with polyneuropathy receiving long-term opioid
therapy were more likely to report having pain at the end of
the study period than were patients with polyneuropathy who
receivedashorterdurationofopioidtherapy(adjustedOR,2.5;
95% CI, 1.9-3.4) (Table 3). The temporal relationship between
the pain rating and multiple opioid prescriptions over time
could not be assessed owing to a lack of multiple data points
over time. Near the end of the study period, patients with poly-
neuropathyreceivinglong-termopioidtherapyalsohadgreater
difficulty performing some of their activities of daily living and
self-reported more functional limitations such as difficulty
climbing stairs (adjusted OR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.2-2.4), needing an

ers of functional status were worse among patients with poly-

To our knowledge, this is the first population-based study on
the prevalence of long-term opioid therapy among patients
with polyneuropathy and its association with functional sta-
tus, adverse outcomes, and mortality. We found that diagno-

therapy even when polyneuropathy is not mentioned in the

 long-term opioid therapy may be associated with a worsened
functional status beyond that of polyneuropathy, and ad-
verse outcomes commonly linked to opioid use occurred more
often among patients with polyneuropathy receiving long-
term opioid therapy. An unanswered and potentially con-
founding issue is whether the differing severity of pain be-
tween those receiving long-term opioid therapy and those
receiving shorter-duration opioid therapy might be driving
worsened functional status and more adverse outcomes.
Althoughpolyneuropathywasassociatedwithagreaterlike-
lihood of long-term opioid therapy, it was the indication for a
minority of long-term opioid prescriptions, based on clinician
documentation. Musculoskeletal pain was the most common
documented indication for starting long-term opioid therapy.
It is possible that peripheral and central sensitization occur-
ring in polyneuropathy decreases the pain threshold and pa-
tients’abilitiestotoleratenonneuropathic(nociceptive)pain,18
thus leading to increased rates of long-term opioid prescrip-
tionsfornociceptivemusculoskeletalpainamongpatientswith
polyneuropathy. In another study, more than 40% of patients
with polyneuropathy had nonneuropathic or mixed-type pain,
while only 20% had strictly neuropathic pain.19 Pain without
typical neuropathic qualities20 may, therefore, still be associ-
ated with the underlying polyneuropathy, making it indirectly
the indication for opioid therapy.
Neurologists are often involved in the diagnosis and man-
agement of polyneuropathy, but they were unlikely to be the
prescribers of long-term opioid therapy in this study. Further-
more, pain physicians saw one-fourth of patients with poly-
neuropathyreceivinglong-termopioidtherapyduringthestudy
period,buttheyweretheprescribersoflong-termopioidtherapy
for only 3.7% of such patients. These data are consistent with
national trends.15 Therefore, it is likely that discussing poten-
tial benefits, as well as adverse outcomes, of long-term opioid
therapy will fall to the primary care clinician.
Reducing pain and improving functional status are com-
monly purported as the goals of analgesia such as long-term
opioid therapy.21 The data available in the present study were

 better suited to addressing the latter and showed that long-
term opioid therapy was not associated with improved func-
tionalstatusamongpatientswithpolyneuropathy.Infact,long-
term opioid therapy made several markers of functional status
worse, including inability to work. This finding is not dissimi-
lar to the finding that long-term opioid use is associated with
disability among those with chronic back pain22 and other
forms of chronic noncancer pain.23
Based on the marked difference in duration of opioid
therapy between those receiving short-term vs long-term opi-
oid therapy (median duration, 17 vs 228 days) and the percent-
age of responders reporting pain (381 of 901 [42.3%] vs 241 of
337 [71.5%]; Table 3), these appear to be 2 potentially different
populations with regard to baseline pain and patterns of opi-
oid use. Pain was neither qualitatively described nor quantita-
tivelygradedinseverityinthesurveyinstrumentused.Thelack
ofavalidatedpaininstrumentadministeredovertimeprevented
differentiation of those with painful vs nonpainful neuropathy
and assessment of the efficacy of opioid analgesia. Therefore,
painreportingmaybereflectiveofinadequateanalgesiaorsim-
ply that some analgesia occurred but the patient was not made
pain free (ie, self-rating of pain decreased from 8 to 3 on a scale
of 10, where 0 is no pain and 10 is the worst possible pain). It
remains a possibility that impaired functional status may be
associatedwiththehigherbaselinepainitselfandnotthelong-
term opioid therapy. However, even if pain was driving func-
tionalimpairment,thefindingsdidnotsupportimprovedfunc-
tional status with long-term opioid use.
As a chronic condition with an already notable amount of
impairmentincludingpain,11 itisimportantforhealthcarepro-
fessionalstoavoidiatrogenicallycausingmorbidityandprovide

thatotheradverseoutcomeslinkedtoopioidusewerealsomore
likelyinpatientswithpolyneuropathyreceivinglong-termopi-
oid therapy. A diagnosis of opioid abuse among patients with
polyneuropathy prescribed opioids for any duration was very
rare (≤2% of patients); however, the rate of opioid dependence
was 7.2%, and the rate of opioid overdose was 2.6%. Although
this finding may represent underrecognized opioid abuse from
inadequate screening and detection, it underscores that abuse
anddependencearenotsynonymous.Despitethisincreasedas-
sociationwithopioiddependenceandevenoverdose,therewas
no significant association with overall mortality after adjusting
forconfounders.Thus,ourresultsagreewiththoseofpriorstud-
ies citing that opioid use disorders are more prevalent among
those receiving long-term opioid therapy,8 but we did not find
that long-term opioid therapy significantly increases mortality
among patients with polyneuropathy as it does among broader
populations of patients reported elsewhere.24
Because of the unclear benefit and the risk of adverse ef-
fects from the use of opioids for chronic noncancer pain, in
2016, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention de-
clared that “nonpharmacologic therapy and nonopioid phar-
macologic therapy are preferred for chronic pain.”9(p16) How-
ever, this recommendation is in the setting of the International
Association for the Study of Pain, the European Federation of
Neurological Societies, and the American Academy of Neu-
rology guidelines indicating that opioids are acceptable, al-
beit perhaps not preferred, agents for neuropathic pain.12-14 In
the present study, nonopioid neuropathic pain medications
were used by 46.1% of all patients with polyneuropathy re-
ceiving short-duration opioids and even more (79.5%) by the
subsetofpatientsreceivinglong-termopioidtherapy.Moreim-
portant, however, 111 patients with polyneuropathy receiv-
ing long-term opioid therapy (20.5%) and 782 patients receiv-
ing shorter durations of opioids (53.9%) were not prescribed
any nonopioid analgesic during the study period. Thus, there
are still some patients who could have potentially benefited
from trials of 1 or more nonopioid analgesics. One potential
limitation of this conclusion is that prescriptions prior to 2006
were not available in the database, to ensure against the use
of nonopioid analgesics before the study period. It is also un-
known how many patients in the present study used nonphar-
macologic methods of treating pain, as recommended by the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.9
Twenty years ago, prescribing opioids in the United States
for3monthsorlongerwasessentiallyprohibitedbystatutesand
regulations.25 Lobbying efforts effectively lifted limits on dose,
amount dispensed, and frequency prescribed.26 Eventually,
even the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Or-
ganizationsadoptedpainasthefifthvitalsign.27Thesechanges
led to increased opioid prescribing rates in subsequent years.10
When claims data from more than half a million patients with
new chronic noncancer pain between 2000 and 2005 were ex-
amined, the liberalized opioid prescribing trends had ap-
pearedtoincreasetheprevalenceofopioidusedisordersamong
patientsreceivinglong-termopioidtherapycomparedwithpa-
tients receiving opioids for shorter durations.8
Patient-centered outcomes data of specific populations re-
ceivinglong-termopioidtherapy(ie,forpolyneuropathy),such
as those reported here, can allow patients and clinicians con-
sidering long-term opioid therapy to make informed deci-
sions. Our results, even when interpreted conservatively, sug-
gest unintended consequences of long-term opioid therapy
when it is used for or in the setting of polyneuropathy. This
finding should be considered by physicians counseling pa-
tients with neuropathic pain who are considering opioid an-
algesic therapy, as well as by authors of guidelines, policy, and
consensus statements.
Strengths and Limitations
The strengths of this study included that it was a population-
based cohort including approximately 98% of the population
under study instead of relying on a sample from that popula-
tion. It was also coupled with detailed results of standardized
questionnaires containing patient-reported functional status
outcomes for more than 66% of patients in the study (the sur-
vey item with the lowest number of respondents was stair in-
tolerance, answered by 355 of 541 patients [65.6%] and 980
of 1452 controls [67.5%]). The population of Olmsted County

 use of opioids. This study was also based on prescription data
without confirmation that prescriptions were filled and taken
asintended.Prescriptiondurationwascalculatedinmostcases
presuming patients took each as-needed dosage. Daily mor-
phine equivalents were not estimated, which prevented de-
termination of a dose effect.
Conclusions
The importance of effective and safe use of opioids has been
stressed,21 and policy changes have even been suggested to
limit and improve oversight of opioid prescribing.9,10 This
population-based study examined how opioids were used by
patients with polyneuropathy, a common chronic condition in
which more than two-thirds of patients may receive opioid
therapy.11 By showing that polyneuropathy increases the risk
of long-term opioid therapy and that long-term opioid therapy
is not associated with improved functional status but is asso-
ciated with adverse outcomes, this study provides useful in-
formation to counsel patients with polyneuropathy who are
considering or are already receiving opioid therapy. Further-
more, it provides evidence that could influence treatment
guidelines and health policy.
