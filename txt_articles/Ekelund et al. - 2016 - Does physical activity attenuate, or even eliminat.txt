Abstract 
Background 
High amounts of sedentary behaviour have been associated with increased risks for several chronic 
conditions and mortality. However, it is unclear whether physical activity attenuates or even 
eliminates the detrimental effects of prolonged sitting.     
Methods  
We included data from 16 studies, of which 14 were identified through a systematic review of six 
databases from database inception until October 2015 and two were additional unpublished studies 
where pertinent data were available. All study data were analysed according to a harmonised 
protocol, which categorized reported daily sitting time and TV-viewing time into four standardised 
groups each, and physical activity into quartiles. We then combined data across all studies 
(N=1,005,791) to analyse the joint and stratified associations of daily sitting time and physical activity 
with all-cause mortality, and estimated summary hazard ratios using Cox regression. We repeated 
these analyses using TV-viewing time instead of daily sitting time.  
Findings 
Daily sitting time was not associated with higher all-cause mortality rates among those in the most 
active quartile. Compared with the referent (<4 h of sitting per day and highest quartile of physical 
activity [>35.5 MET-hour/week]), there was no increased risk of dying during follow up in those who 
sat for more than 8h/day but who also reported >35.5 MET-hour/week of activity (HR=1.04; 95% CI, 
0.99, 1.10). In contrast, those who sat the least (<4 h/day) and were in the lowest (<2.5 MET-
 3 
 
 
hour/week) activity quartile had a significantly increased risk of dying during follow-up (HR=1.27, 
95% CI, 1.22, 1.31). For TV viewing time, >3 hours/day was associated with higher mortality rates 
regardless of physical activity, except in the most active quartile, where mortality rates were 
significantly higher only in the >5 hours/day group.    
Interpretation 
High levels of moderate intensity physical activity (i.e. about 60 to 75 minutes per day) appear to 
eliminate the increased risk of death associated with high sitting time. However, this high activity 
level attenuates, but does not eliminate the increased risk associated with high TV viewing time.

INTRODUCTION 
In a seminal 1953 Lancet paper, Morris and colleagues demonstrated an increased risk of coronary 
heart disease (CHD) in London bus drivers compared with conductors.1 Since then, numerous 
observational studies have shown that lack of physical activity is a major risk factor for morbidity and 
premature mortality.2-4 Indeed, recent estimates indicate that not meeting physical activity 
recommendations is responsible for more than 5 million deaths globally each year. 4 
Today, sedentary behaviours are highly prevalent and data from adults in high-income countries 
suggest the majority of time awake is spent sedentary. 5,6 Further, high amounts of sedentary 
behaviour, usually assessed as daily sitting time or time spent viewing TV, have been associated with 
increased risks for several chronic conditions and mortality. 7-9 A crucial question is: if one is active 
enough, will this attenuate or even eliminate the detrimental association of daily sitting time with 
mortality? 8,9    
We therefore conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to examine the joint and stratified 
associations of sedentary behaviour and physical activity with all-cause mortality, using data from 
studies which were analysed according to a standard protocol.   
METHODS 
Data Sources, Literature Search and Study Selection 
Following PRISMA guidelines,10 we identified 16 published 11-26 studies through a systematic review of 
six databases (PubMed, PsycINFO, EMBASE, Web of Science, Sport Discus and Scopus) from data base 
inception until October 30th 2014, updating the search up to October 10th 2015 (a detailed search 
description is provided in the appendix). We also obtained data from two additional studies where 
the pertinent data were available but not published. 27,28 Authors/principal investigators were 
contacted and asked about their willingness to participate in a harmonised meta-analysis. One 
 5 
 
 
study12 did not respond to our request to participate and one additional study was excluded as it 
measured physical activity by accelerometry, which could not be harmonised with self-report data. 
For one other study, the Women’s Health Initiative Observational Study (WHIOS)26 investigators did 
not agree to participate but data for a shorter follow-up were publicly available.29 Thus, individual 
data from 16 studies were analysed according to a pre-defined protocol and included in the 
harmonised meta-analyses. We included English-language, prospective cohort studies that had 
individual level exposure and outcome data, provided data on both daily sitting or TV-viewing time 
and physical activity, and reported effect estimates (hazard ratios, odds ratios or relative risks with 
95% CIs) for all-cause, cardio-vascular disease (CVD), breast, colon and colorectal cancer mortality. 
This review protocol is registered with the PROSPERO database 
(http://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/display_record.asp?ID=CRD42015023870).     
Data extraction 
One author (JSJ) extracted, and all other authors confirmed, the following information from each 
eligible study: name of the first author, study location, source and number of participants, age, 
number of men and women, years of follow-up, number of deaths from all-causes, cancer, and 
cardio-vascular disease (CVD) and methods of ascertainment, assessment details for physical activity 
and sitting time, and covariates included in adjusted models (Table 1).    
Data Harmonisation 
To reduce heterogeneity we first reviewed the questionnaires used to assess sedentary behaviour 
and physical activity, then determined whether it was possible to define these exposures using the 
same metric across all studies. All but two studies13,14 asked about sitting time using an open-ended 
format or categories that could be collapsed into four or five common groups (Supplementary Table 
1). Of the remaining two studies, one13 used five categories (almost none, 1/4 of the time, 1/2 of the 
time, 3/4 of the time and almost all) that were collapsed into four by combining the two highest 
categories, while another used only three categories of sitting time14 (see Appendix). Data on TV-
 6 
 
 
time from six studies 16,20,22-25 could be combined into four common groups (Supplementary Table 2). 
Data from each study were reanalysed using predefined categories of sitting time in four groups (0-
<4h/day, 4-<6 h/day, 6-8h/day, >8h/day) and TV-viewing time in four groups (<1 h/day, 1-2 h/day, 3-
4 h/day and >5 h/day).     
Physical activity was assessed by different validated self-report questionnaires in all studies. To 
reduce heterogeneity in the assessment of physical activity, we only included information on walking 
and leisure time and recreational physical activities (including exercise and sports) as this information 
was available from all studies (Supplementary table 1). We asked each contributing study to 
recalculate their estimated physical activity energy expenditure by multiplying the reported duration 
by the intensity, and expressing physical activity in MET-hours per week (MET-h/week). We used the 
same MET-values for intensity as in the original publications. For those studies that simply reported 
duration of specific physical activities 14,19,22 we assigned the following conventionally accepted 
intensity levels: walking, 3.3 METs; moderate intensity activity, 4 METs; vigorous intensity activity, 7 
METs; and strenuous sports, 7.2 METs. 30 Therefore, our estimate of physical activity reflects 
participation in moderate and vigorous intensity activity (MVPA). Due to the design of the questions 
used for assessing physical activity it was not possible to calculate MET-h/week in its continuous 
form in four studies. 14,17,22,27 In these studies, we asked contributing studies to calculate MET-h/week 
in three 14 or four 17,22,27  categories which were assumed to reflect the quartiles derived from the 
other studies (Supplementary Table 2).  
The median MET-h/week across studies for the upper boundary for the 1st (lowest) quartile was 2.5 
MET-h/week (equivalent to about 5 minutes of moderate intensity activity per day). Corresponding 
values for the 2nd and 3rd quartiles were 16 MET-h/week (about 25-35 min of moderate intensity 
activity per day) and 30 MET-h/week (about 50-65 min of moderate intensity activity per day), and 
the lower boundary for the 4th (top) quartile was 35.5 MET-h/week (about 60-75 min of moderate 
 7 
 
 
intensity activity per day) (Supplementary Table 2). Examples of moderate intensity activities are 
brisk walking at 5.6 km/h, and bicycling for pleasure at 16 km/h. 30   
Quality assessment  
Using the study quality checklist proposed by Kmet et al 31 two authors (JSJ and UE) independently 
assessed the studies and any disagreements were resolved by consensus. Studies were scored (0- No, 
1- Partial, 2-Yes) on 14 criteria. The sum of all scores was then divided by the highest possible score 
(28), giving quality scores ranging from 0 (worst) to 1 (best).  
Data analyses and syntheses 
Principal authors/investigators for all studies except one reanalysed their data according to a 
harmonised protocol using minimally adjusted models (adjusted for sex and age) and in models that 
adjusted for the same covariates as in their original publications. For the WHIOS study we used 
publicly available individual level data to perform the analyses. 29 
All studies except for three 17-19 either excluded all participants with major chronic diseases at 
baseline or excluded deaths occurring within at least one year in sensitivity analyses. Two of the 
remaining three studies, 18,19 which included older participants, provided analyses for this meta-
analysis in which deaths within the first two years were excluded. The remaining study 17, which had 
a short follow-up period (mean, 2.8 years), analysed their data excluding those with baseline 
cardiovascular disease (CVD), diabetes and cancer. Thus, all studies in this meta-analysis included, for 
the most part, apparently healthy participants at baseline.  
We first performed joint analyses of the associations of daily sitting time, physical activity and all-
cause mortality, to directly compare groups with different amounts of sitting  time and physical 
activity against those who sat the least (<4 h/day; arbitrarily chosen based on questionnaire 
categories) and also had the most physical activity (top quartile >35.5 MET-h/week) (i.e., referent). 
Effect estimates were calculated using Cox regression analyses and presented as hazard ratios (HRs) 
 8 
 
 
with their associated 95% confidence intervals. We estimated summary HRs across studies with a 
fixed effect inverse variance method. 32 We then repeated these analyses, but used TV-viewing time 
instead of sitting time. 
Next, in stratified analyses (stratification by physical activity), we assessed whether the dose-
response relationship between sitting and mortality differed among persons with different activity 
levels, to address whether physical activity modified the detrimental effect of prolonged sitting. That 
is, we separately investigated the relationship between sitting time and all-cause mortality rates for 
each quartile of physical activity, with those sitting the least serving as referent. We then repeated 
these analyses using TV time instead. 
In secondary analyses we repeated all analyses but used CVD and cancer mortality as the outcomes. 
We also tested whether the HRs differed between extreme groups (i.e. the group who sat the most 
and also had the most activity, compared with the group who sat the least and were least active). We 
performed sensitivity analyses and separated the highest category for sedentary time into two (8-10 
h/day and >10 h/day) and repeated the analyses; we estimated the impact of each individual study 
by repeating the meta-analysis for all-cause mortality, excluding one study at a time, and we also 
examined publication bias33 and heterogeneity; these findings are reported in the Appendix. Finally, 
we reanalysed our data and estimated summary HRs across studies with random effect models and 
the main findings were unchanged (data not shown). All meta-analyses were performed using Matlab 
(R2014a, The Mathworks, Inc.).

Study Selection and characteristics

The literature search, study selection and reasons for study exclusion are summarised in Figure 1. In 
total, 8,381 articles were identified by searching six different databases. Ninety-eight papers were 
retrieved for full text review, of which 16 were identified as eligible for inclusion. Quality scores were 
high, exceeding 0.85 in all studies (Table 1). 
Thirteen studies 13-22,27-29 including 1,005,791 individuals who were followed between 2 and 14 years, 
during which 84,609 (8.4%) died, were included in the meta-analysis of the associations of sitting 
time and physical activity with all-cause mortality. Nine studies 13-16,20-22,28-29 also had data on CVD 
mortality and eight 13-16,20,22,28-29 on cancer mortality. Three 16,20,22 of the 13 studies also had data on 
TV-viewing time, and with three additional studies 23-25, contributed to the meta-analysis of the joint 
associations of TV-viewing time and physical activity with all-cause mortality (N=465,450; 43,740 
deaths).  
Joint association analyses 
The summary HRs for the joint associations of sitting time and physical activity with all-cause 
mortality are shown in Figure 2a and supplementary Table 4.  A clear dose-response association was 
observed, with an almost curvilinear augmented risk for all-cause mortality with increased sitting 
time in combination with lower levels of activity. Compared with the referent group (i.e. those sitting 
<4 h/day and in the most active quartile), mortality rates during follow up were 12 to 59% higher in 
the two lowest quartiles of physical activity, even when sitting time was lowest. 
However, in the third quartile of physical activity (i.e., the second most active group), only those 
sitting 4 or more h/day had higher mortality rates. Among the most active, there was no significant 
relation between amount of sitting and mortality rates, suggesting that  high physical activity 
eliminated the increased risk of prolonged sitting on mortality. Indeed, this observation was 
confirmed in sensitivity analyses using five categories for sitting time (Supplementary Table 5).  
Since we did not have access to individual level data from all studies, we estimated whether hazard 
ratios between groups differed significantly, as described in the appendix. Those in the most active 
 10 
 
 
quartile, but who also reported the most sitting (>8 h/day), had a significantly lower risk (p<0.0001) 
of dying during follow-up (HR=1.04, 95%CI, 0.99, 1.10) than the least active who also sat the least (<4 
h/day) (HR=1.27, 95% CI, 1.22, 1.30). 
We then repeated these analyses with TV-viewing time instead of sitting time. Largely parallel 
findings were observed, although the effect estimates were less precise, possibly because of smaller 
sample sizes (Figure 2b and Supplementary Table 4). In those who watched TV >5h/day, the hazard 
for all-cause mortality was markedly increased by between 16% and 93% across activity quartiles. 
Among the most active quartile, only this amount of TV-viewing time (>5 h/day) was significantly 
associated with an increased hazard (HR=1.16, 95% CI, 1.05, 1.28). In comparison, persons in the 
least active quartile who watched only <1 h/day of TV experienced a statistically significantly higher 
risk (HR 1.32, 95% CI, 1.20, 1.46; [p=0.007]).  
In a subsample of studies with available data, we examined CVD and cancer mortality. The results for 
CVD mortality were similar to those observed for all-cause mortality (Supplementary Table 6). For 
cancer mortality, increased hazards of between 12% and 22% with more sitting time were observed 
only for persons in the least active quartile (Supplementary Table 7). Using TV-viewing time instead 
of sitting time did not materially change the results for CVD and cancer mortality (Supplementary 
Table 8 and 9).  
Stratified analyses 
The associations between sitting time and all-cause mortality are shown separately for individuals in 
four levels (quartiles) of physical activity in Table 2. Among the three least active quartiles, increased 
all-cause mortality rates were observed with increased sitting time, compared with the referent 
categories (<4 h/day). The hazard of sitting >8 h/day was much higher in the least active quartile 
(27%) than in the second (12%) and third (10%) activity quartiles.  In the most active quartile, there 
was no statistically significant association between daily sitting time and all-cause mortality.  
 11 
 
 
We then analysed TV-viewing time instead of sitting time, using as referent those who watched TV 
for <1 h/day (Table 3). TV viewing for up to 2 h/day did not significantly increase the risk of mortality 
during follow-up in any activity strata; however, three or more h/day of TV-viewing time was 
associated with increased risk among all, except for the most active quartile. Among this group, >5 
h/day of TV viewing was associated with an increased hazard (HR=1.15; 95% CI, 1.05, 1.27) for all-
cause mortality.   
DISCUSSION 
These analyses, including data from more than 1 million individuals, indicate that high levels of 
physical activity, equivalent to 60 to 75 minutes of moderate intensity physical activity per day, 
appear to eliminate the increased mortality risks associated with high total sitting time. Indeed, 
those in the highest physical activity quartile (~60-75 minutes/day) who sat for more than 8 hours 
daily had a significantly lower risk of dying during follow up than those who sat for less than four 
hours in the least active quartile (~5 minutes/day). In the middle two quartiles of physical activity 
(which encompass current physical activity guideline levels34), the mortality risks associated with 
more sitting time were attenuated compared with those seen in the least active quartile. For TV 
viewing time, the results were similar, except that high physical activity attenuated, but did not 
eliminate the risk, in those viewing TV ≥5 h/day.    
Our harmonised meta-analytical approach allowed us to examine associations among sedentary 
behaviours, physical activity and all-cause mortality with greater precision and a more uniform 
classification of sedentary behaviour and physical activity than has previously been possible. The 
results suggest that high levels of physical activity attenuate the harmful effects of prolonged sitting 
time. Across sitting time categories, all-cause mortality rates were considerably reduced at higher 
levels of physical activity, and eliminated in those who were the most active. These results were 
consistent in joint and stratified analyses and in analyses of CVD and cancer mortality. By combining 
the results of a larger number of studies, and using a harmonised approach to reduce heterogeneity 
 12 
 
 
in the exposure variables, we were able to reduce statistical uncertainty in the results and also 
estimate levels of sitting time and physical activity for informing public health policy.  
The amount of physical activity in the top quartile equated to approximately 60 to 75 minutes of 
moderate intensity activity per day or more. This is beyond the basic level of most physical activity 
recommendations for public health 34, 35 but only slightly greater than the upper amount 
recommended in the Australian Physical Activity Guidelines 36 and the level recommended by the US 
guidelines 35 for “even greater health benefits” (one hour a day of moderate intensity activity). 
Notably, 60 to 75 minutes of moderate intensity activity is congruent with the level of physical 
activity showing maximum mortality benefit in a recent large meta-analysis.37 In the present study, 
this amount of activity (reported by one quarter of the participants), was required to eliminate the 
increased hazard associated with sitting for more than 8 hours per day. However, even those in the 
second quartile of physical activity (~25-35 min of moderate intensity activity per day, which is 
congruent with the basic level recommended), there were smaller increases in mortality risks 
associated with high sitting time than were seen in the least active group (~5 minutes per day), even 
though the risks were not completely eliminated. In comparison with other risk factors for poor 
health, the increased mortality risk (58%) in those who sat for more than 8 hours per day and were 
also least active, is similar to that of smoking 39 and obesity. 40 
If daily sitting time and TV viewing time capture similar aspects of sedentary behaviour, we expected 
broadly similar magnitudes of associations from both exposures. Yet the effect of TV viewing on all-
cause mortality appeared to be stronger in magnitude. This difference is congruent with previous 
observations 20 and may be partly due to differences in the accuracy of reporting these behaviours.  
However, other explanations are also plausible. TV viewing typically occurs in the evenings (at least, 
for the generation represented in the included studies), usually after dinner, and prolonged 
postprandial sedentary time may be particularly detrimental for glucose and lipid metabolism. 41 It is 
also plausible that individuals break up their sitting time more frequently during work than when 
 13 
 
 
viewing TV, and breaking up sedentary time appears to be beneficial for various cardio-metabolic risk 
factors. 41 Another explanation for the difference observed could be that TV viewing may be 
accompanied by snacking behaviours 42 and food advertising on TV may affect eating behaviour. 43 
Thus, associated dietary behaviours may explain some of the differences observed.  
Our meta-analysis has considerable strengths. Most important, all original study data were 
reanalysed in a harmonised manner. This approach substantially reduced heterogeneity between 
studies for measures of sedentary behaviour and physical activity, and allowed direct interpretation 
of levels of sitting time and physical activity (beyond comparing “high” versus “low”). The large 
sample size allowed detailed joint analyses of the dose-response associations among sedentary 
behaviours, physical activity, and mortality, providing precise effect estimates with narrow 
confidence intervals. We performed sub-group analyses to examine possible bias from any single 
study by reanalysing all data, excluding each study one at a time and the results were essentially 
unchanged (data available on request). Mortality ascertainment varied across studies but all used 
official national or regional registers, likely to be high or complete. Our observation that physical 
activity may eliminate the detrimental association between daily sitting time and mortality is 
biologically plausible. There is evidence that one hour of moderate intensity activity positively 
influences postprandial lipid metabolism following 8 hours of sitting 44, and  that 45 minutes of 
cycling at moderate intensity following more than 10 hours of sitting has beneficial effects on glucose 
metabolism in type 2 diabetes.45 
There also are limitations; first, the majority of studies included participants older than 45 years and 
all but one study was conducted in the US, western Europe or Australia. Thus, the results may not be 
generalizable beyond these populations. Second, all except two studies combined data from men 
and women, which precluded specific analyses. Third, residual confounding may exist. A priori, we 
required contributing studies to control for the same covariates included in their original publication. 
However, unmeasured or poorly measured confounders may have distorted our results. Fourth, 
although we did not find any evidence for publication bias, we cannot rule out that publication bias 
 14 
 
 
may exist, due to the low number of studies in some analyses. Fifth, we attempted to minimise bias 
from reverse causation (i.e., illness causing individuals to become sedentary) by including apparently 
healthy participants; however, we cannot fully rule this out. Sixth, all studies asked participants to 
self-report sedentary behaviour and physical activity at one point in time. This increases the chance 
of random measurement error, which would attenuate true associations.  
In conclusion, high levels of moderate intensity physical activity (i.e. about 60 to 75 minutes per day) 
appear to eliminate the increased risk of death associated with high sitting time. However, this high 
activity level attenuates, but does not eliminate the increased risk associated with high TV viewing 
time. If long periods of sitting time each day are unavoidable (e.g. for work or transport), it is 
important also to be physically active.

the risks of many non-communicable diseases such as type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, stroke, 
some cancers and premature mortality. Sedentary behaviour, on the other hand, has emerged as a 
potential risk factor for many chronic conditions and mortality during the last decade. A recent meta-
analysis suggested that prolonged TV-viewing time is associated with increased risk for type 2 
diabetes, cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality. Two other meta-analyses have examined 
the associations of sitting time with non-communicable disease incidence and mortality. One of 
these concluded that prolonged sitting time is associated with increased risks of deleterious health 
outcomes regardless of physical activity level, whereas the other concluded that physical activity (no 
details on the amount of activity were provided) appears to attenuate the increased risk of high 
sitting time on all-cause mortality. No previous systematic review has directly compared the joint 
effects of different, specified levels of physical activity and sitting time, to investigate the associations 
of different amounts of sitting time and physical activity in relation to all-cause mortality. Such 
information is required for the development of public health guidelines targeting sedentary 
behaviour. The crucial question is: if one is active enough, will this attenuate, or even eliminate, the 
detrimental association of high sitting time with mortality?  
We performed a systematic literature search in six databases (PubMed, PsycINFO, EMBASE, Web of 
Science, Sport Discus and Scopus) from database inception until October 2015, following the PRISMA 
guidelines. In total, 8,381 articles were initially identified. Ninety-eight papers were retrieved for full 
text review, of which 16 were identified as eligible for inclusion. We also identified two studies in 
which the pertinent data were available but unpublished. We then contacted the principal 
author/investigator of these 18 studies and asked whether they were willing to reanalyse their data 
according to a harmonised protocol. In total, 16 studies were analysed according to a pre-defined 
protocol and included in this harmonised meta-analyses (details on the 2 excluded studies are 
provided in the text). 
Added value  
This is the first meta-analysis to use a harmonised approach to directly compare mortality rates 
among persons with different levels of sitting time and physical activity.  Examining the joint effects 
of these two behaviours is important, because most people engage in both behaviours every day, so 
the effects of both should be considered in public health guidelines.

Implications  
These results provide further evidence on the benefits of physical activity, particularly in societies 
where increasing numbers of people have to sit for long hours for work or transport. Our findings 
indicate that more sitting time is associated with higher all-cause mortality rates; however, the 
magnitude of increased risk with more sitting time is mitigated among physically active persons. 
Indeed, among those belonging to the most active quartile and who are active about 60-75 minutes 
per day of moderate intensity physical activity, there appears to be no increased risk of mortality 
even if they sit for >8 hours a day.
