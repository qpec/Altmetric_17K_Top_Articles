Abstract
Multiple cortical areas contribute to visual processing in mice. However, the functional 
organization and development of higher visual areas are unclear. Here, we used intrinsic signal 
optical imaging and 2-photon calcium imaging to map visual responses in adult and developing 
mice. We found that visually driven activity was well-correlated among higher visual areas within 
two distinct subnetworks resembling the dorsal and ventral visual streams. Visual response 
magnitude in dorsal stream areas slowly increased over the first two weeks of visual experience. 
By contrast, ventral stream areas exhibited strong responses shortly after eye opening. Neurons in 
a dorsal stream area showed little change in their tuning sharpness to oriented gratings while those 
in a ventral stream area increased stimulus selectivity and expanded their receptive fields 
significantly. Together, these findings provide a functional basis for grouping subnetworks of 
mouse visual areas and revealed stream differences in the development of receptive field 
properties.

 INTRODUCTION
Mammalian visual cortex is comprised of a primary visual cortex (V1; also known as striate 
cortex) and several higher visual areas (HVAs, or extrastriate cortex). Together, V1 and 
HVAs form an intricate and reciprocally connected network1–6. Lesion studies in primates7,8 
have revealed distinct functions for two parallel visual processing pathways: the ventral and 
dorsal streams. The ventral stream is crucial for form vision and object recognition, while 
the dorsal stream is important for perception of motion in visual stimuli9,10.
Recent anatomical studies in mouse cortex revealed two subnetworks of HVAs that resemble 
the ventral and dorsal streams seen in primates2,3,11. Of the areas immediately surrounding 
V1, two lateral areas, lateralmedial (LM) and laterointermediate (LI), have been 
anatomically identified as nodes of a ventral stream pathway, and posteromedial (PM), 
anteromedial (AM), anterior (A), rostrolateral (RL) and anterolateral (AL) areas as nodes of 
a dorsal stream pathway3. Projections among V1 and HVAs exhibit specific expression 
patterns of pre- and postsynaptic receptors such as metabotropic glutamate activation12–14. 
Moreover, projections from HVAs to V1 form distinct network structures that manifest in 
patches around M2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor-rich regions15. These findings are 
indicative of distinct synaptic drive and modulation among HVAs that likely convey unique 
functional properties16,17.
Attempts to understand the functional organization of HVAs, on the other hand, have 
produced conflicting results. The tuning properties of HVAs are area-specific, varying in 
temporal and spatial frequency preferences18,19, and axonal boutons originating from V1, an 
area with a wide range of receptive field properties, are specifically tuned to the preferred 
properties of the postsynaptic target HVAs in which they terminate20. In these studies, dorsal 
stream HVAs exhibited strong selectivities for direction and orientation18,19,21, in line with 
the suggested roles of dorsal stream in perceiving motion. In contrast, another study 
examining HVA responses to plaid motion stimuli suggested that LM, an anatomically 
described ventral stream HVA3, is functionally placed in the dorsal stream capable of 
responding to integrated global motion22. Thus, a consensus on functional delineations 
between putative dorsal and ventral streams in mice has been elusive. Those that work 
together may develop together. To understand the selective structuring of the mouse visual 
circuitry, we sought to determine how the HVAs functionally develop during the postnatal 
period immediately after eye-opening.
Here, we used intrinsic signal optical imaging (ISOI) and 2-photon calcium (2p Ca2+) 
imaging to investigate correlated activity among V1 and HVAs, and to determine the 
developmental time course of visual responses of HVAs in mice. We found that HVAs in 
mice form two subnetworks, which match anatomically identified putative analogs of the 
dorsal and ventral streams in primates. The two subnetworks are functionally distinct in their 
activity patterns, developmental time courses, and single-cell receptive field properties. Post-
eye opening, visual response maturation of dorsal stream HVAs was noticeably slower than 
that of the ventral stream HVAs, and was vulnerable to a lack of visual experience. 
Subsequent re-exposure to light failed to induce a full recovery of dorsal stream HVAs. 
Neurons in ventral stream area, on the other hand, sharpened their orientation tuning and

 increased the receptive field size during development despite the modest change in their 
overall response strength. These findings, to our knowledge, provide for the first time a 
functional basis for the classification of the two HVA networks, dorsal and ventral streams in 
mice.
RESULTS
Mapping visual areas using intrinsic signal optical imaging
ISOI was used to measure neural activity in V1 and HVAs. Mice viewed a stimulus monitor 
placed obliquely to cover 5° to 115° of the contralateral visual hemifield. Stimuli that 
appeared at the center of the monitor were thus positioned at 60° in the animals’ lateral 
visual field. Visual stimuli positioned at such an angle activate both medial and lateral HVAs 
equally well in adult mice19,23. Retinotopic maps of visual cortex were obtained using a high 
contrast bar drifting in elevation or azimuth, and allowed reliable identification of V1 and 
six HVAs, PM, AM, RL, AL, LM and LI (Fig. 1a–d). The borders of area A could be 
inferred after mapping adjacent HVAs and V1, however, we did not observe reliable visually 
evoked activation in area A (ref. 18). The topographical representation of the visual hemifield 
observed in V1 was also preserved within the HVAs, in either reversed order (sharing a 
meridian with a neighboring area) or with a twist in the orientation (e.g. compare azimuth 
retinotopy in PM and V1). Thus, the two orthogonal retinotopic maps, elevation and azimuth 
(Fig. 1c,d), together revealed the precise locations of horizontal and vertical meridians, 
which defined the borders among V1 and HVAs1,18,24. Regions of interest (ROIs) for 
quantitative analysis of evoked activity in V1 and HVAs were drawn using these meridians 
as landmarks. The only exception was the border between AM and PM. Although there was 
a reliable meridian in adult mice, the delineation between the two areas was not reliable in 
developing pups. Therefore, to ensure reliable and conservative analysis across all ages 
studied, these two areas were grouped together as AM/PM for quantification. In a subset of 
animals, a small square aperture (10° × 10°) with drifting gratings of rapidly changing 
orientation were presented which evoked discernable visually responsive areas in individual 
HVAs (Fig. 1e,f). These maps confirmed the reliability of the ROIs drawn on retinotopic 
maps generated using drifting single bar stimuli. The retinotopic maps were superior to the 
maps generated by small aperture gratings for mapping HVAs as the retinotopic maps 
revealed each entire area rather than a small portion.
After mapping HVAs with drifting bars, we measured evoked activity levels in V1 and HVAs 
using the magnitude of the intrinsic signal in response to square wave gratings and random 
dot kinematogram visual stimuli (see Methods and Supplementary Fig.1). Each stimulus 
was stationary for six seconds and in motion for two seconds comprising a stimulus period 
of eight seconds that repeated for 50 cycles. To first examine the relative functional 
properties among V1 and HVAs in mature circuitry, we imaged visual responses in adult 
mice (≥ P40).
Response correlations among HVAs
Because we simultaneously imaged V1 and HVAs, we were able to reduce each map to a six 
dimensional vector, with each element representing the average activation level in a cortical

 area. We used these vectors to examine correlations in activation among the areas in adult 
mice (P40 – P65, n = 22). Response magnitudes in most HVAs were well correlated 
(Pearson’s R > 0.5) with activity in V1 (Supplementary Fig. 2a,b). This is expected for two 
reasons. First, V1 provides strong input to HVAs, with the remaining input emerging from 
other cortical areas3, thalamic nuclei, and other brain structures. Second, general response 
levels can be affected globally with anesthetic depth25. In fact, while raw response 
magnitude measurements were heavily affected by the depth of anesthesia, values for 
individual HVAs normalized to the same animal’s V1 measurement were noticeably resistant 
to the changes in anesthesia level (Supplementary Fig. 3).
Overall, correlation coefficients were higher for adjacent cortical areas (e.g., RL and AL: 
Pearson’s R = 0.94 for gratings, 0.84 for kinematograms; P < 0.0001 for both; 
Supplementary Fig. 2a,b), and lower for areas that do not share a border (e.g., V1 and LI: 
Pearson’s R = 0.55 for gratings, 0.42 for kinematograms; P = 0.0087, P = 0.0048, 
respectively; Supplementary Fig. 2a,b). An exception to this general trend is the high 
correlation between AM/PM and AL (Pearson’s R = 0.94 for gratings, 0.82 for 
kinematograms; P < 0.0001 for both; Supplementary Fig. 2a,b), which are on opposite sides 
of V1. This exception is consistent with AL and AM/PM being components of the same 
processing network, analogous to the dorsal stream, as suggested by previous anatomical 
studies2,3,11.
Next, we investigated the correlations among the HVAs. For this analysis, raw response 
magnitudes from the intrinsic signal maps were normalized to the average response 
magnitude of V1 within each map. This provides a control for general levels of cortical 
response per mouse (Supplementary Fig. 3), and correlation coefficients computed after this 
normalization reflect correlations among HVAs themselves. Areas AL, RL, and AM/PM 
exhibited high correlations among each other in response magnitudes across maps evoked by 
both gratings and kinematograms. Similarly, areas LM and LI were well correlated in their 
response magnitudes. The clustering of the two streams remained strong even when 
correlations varied between stimulus types (Fig. 1g,h; Supplementary Table 1). This 
suggests that LM and LI are components of one subnetwork while AL, RL, and AM/PM are 
components of another. Principal component analyses (PCA) on the response magnitudes 
also supported the grouping of HVAs into anatomically identified dorsal and ventral areas3 
(Fig. 1i,j). Thus, by measuring response magnitudes to visual stimuli in V1 and six HVAs 
simultaneously, we detected correlations that provide functional evidence to support the 
grouping of HVAs into anatomically identified2,3 dorsal and ventral streams. Accordingly, 
we proceeded to group the AM/PM, RL and AL as dorsal, and LM and LI as ventral stream 
subnetworks for further comparative analyses between the two streams.
Early and late-developing HVAs: ventral and dorsal stream pathways and their experience-
dependence
We next examined the functional development of HVAs in juvenile mice. Visually evoked 
activity was measured in developing pups immediately following eye opening at P13 to P36 
(Fig. 2). In pups of ages P13 – P18, ISOI was performed transcranially. In these instances, 
the skull was rendered optically transparent by immersing in physiological saline. For pups

 of ages from P20 – P36, the skull overlaying the visual cortex was removed to install a 
cranial window for chronic intrinsic imaging26. This approach prevented the growing 
thickness of the skull from interfering with optical imaging27 (Supplementary Fig. 4), and 
allowed for repeated imaging once every four days for over two weeks. Imaging of visually 
evoked cortical responses was possible shortly after eye opening28 (Fig. 2a,b). Grating 
patches evoked cortical activity that revealed a prominent dichotomy in the developmental 
trajectory of the two subnetworks. Ventral stream HVAs were responsive shortly after eye 
opening and quickly matured within the first few days of visual experience. By contrast, 
dorsal stream HVAs were only weakly responsive in immature pups and slowly developed 
over the next two weeks (ANOVA: dorsal stream, P < 0.0001; ventral stream, P = 0.4186; 
Tukey-Kramer HSD: dorsal stream P13 – 18, P < 0.0001; P20, P = 0.0002; P24, P = 0.036; 
P28, P = 0.90; P32, P = 0.037; Fig. 2b,c). The differential developmental time courses were 
also observed in individual HVAs among which AM/PM, RL, and AL took two weeks after 
eye opening to develop their response amplitude whereas LM and LI showed strong 
response as early as a couple of days after eye opening (Supplemental Fig. 5). The observed 
differential functional development was not stimulus-type specific. As seen with gratings, 
responses to kinematograms developed more slowly in dorsal stream HVAs compared to the 
ventral stream HVAs (ANOVA: dorsal stream, P = 0.0007; ventral stream, P = 0.0016; 
Tukey-Kramer HSD: dorsal stream, P15/16, P = 0.0008; P17/18, P = 0.0033; P20, P = 
0.0061; ventral stream, P17/18, P = 0.0013; Fig. 2d).
Delayed development of dorsal stream HVAs suggested that these areas require visual 
experience post eye opening for normal circuit refinement. To test this idea, we dark-reared 
(DR) mice from E14 through P40 (Fig. 2e) and measured cortical visual responses to grating 
stimuli using ISOI. Indeed, P40 mice raised in complete darkness showed significantly 
weaker responses to the visual stimulus in dorsal stream areas (ANOVA: P = 0.028; n = 9 
DR mice, n = 13 P40 control mice; Fig. 2f, h). Notably, the response in ventral stream HVAs 
only shows a slight but non-significant decrease compared to those in mice reared normally 
(ANOVA: P = 0.16; Fig. 2h), suggesting that dorsal stream areas require visual experience 
for proper functional development while ventral stream areas are more resilient to 
deprivation. Analysis of individual HVAs revealed that visual responses in areas AM/PM 
and AL are significantly lower in DR mice compared to control P40 mice (P = 0.0071, P = 
0.0351, respectively), and these effects are greater than DR effects observed in ventral 
stream area LM (P = 0.0110, P = 0.0319, respectively; see Methods for statistical analysis). 
Moreover, in mice reared in darkness to P40 and then reared normally for 25 days to P65, 
dorsal stream HVAs remained less responsive (ANOVA: P = 0.0045), while normal visual 
responses were observed in ventral stream HVAs (ANOVA: P = 0.39; n = 9 recovery mice, n 
= 9 P65 control mice; Fig. 2e, g, h). These results indicate that the experience-dependent 
development of dorsal stream HVAs is restricted to an early time window prior to P40.
Visual responses at individual neuron resolution
To understand the cellular underpinnings of the quantitative data from ISOI, we also 
performed 2p Ca2+ imaging experiments. We first directly compared the relative 
responsiveness from intrinsic signal maps and 2p Ca2+ imaging at the single cell level

 within the same adult mice that expressed virally-transduced genetically encoded Ca2+ 
indicator, GCaMP6s (Fig. 3).
The data from ISOI were quantified as an average intrinsic signal magnitude per cortical 
area. By contrast, the data from 2p Ca2+ imaging were action potential associated calcium 
transients for individual neurons (Fig. 3a,b). To compare these very different data sets, ratios 
of responsiveness between cortical areas were used. For intrinsic signal maps, the 
responsiveness was simply measured as a ratio of average intrinsic signals between two 
cortical areas. For 2p Ca2+ imaging data, the fraction of cells that responded on a given 
stimulus presentation (averaged over 50 cycles) was computed. Measurements from two 
different cortical areas were then used to construct a ratio. The calculated ratios for Ca2+ 
imaging and intrinsic signal magnitude for the same cortical areas were compared in the 
same mouse in response to the same visual stimulus. The results showed a high correlation 
between intrinsic and calcium signals (R = 0.92, P = 0.027; n = 5; Fig. 3c). This is consistent 
with previous work demonstrating that hemodynamic intrinsic signals faithfully reflect 
underlying neuronal activity in the mouse29–31.
Next, we sought to compare the development of a dorsal stream area to that of a ventral 
stream area on the cellular level. To this end, we measured fundamental receptive field 
properties in PM (dorsal stream) and LM (ventral stream) in GCaMP6s-expressing 
transgenic mice at P20 and P36.
Developmental changes in responses to drifting gratings
We first examined the cellular response to oriented gratings, the stimuli used for ISOI. To 
examine cellular responses in further detail and detect area-specific response property 
development, we used 12 different directions and two spatial frequencies: 0.04 cycles/degree 
(low spatial frequency, LSF: matched to gratings used for ISOI), and 0.32 cycles/degree 
(high spatial frequency, HSF). In accordance with the ISOI results, response magnitude in 
PM neurons significantly increased between P20 and P36 to LSF gratings of all directions 
while LM neurons showed significant but more modest increase (Fig. 4a,b; P20–P36 
increase in LM neurons = 1.3 ± 0.053; in PM neurons = 1.7 ± 0.082; P < 0.0001, rank-sum 
test for both; increase in PM > increase in LM, P < 0.0001, rank sum test; n = 266 LM 
neurons at P20, 442 at P36, 341 PM neurons at P20, 329 at P36). Moreover, PM response 
strengthened significantly more for HSF than LSF gratings (P < 0.0001, rank-sum test), 
whereas LM response modestly increased to a similar extent for both HSF and LSF gratings 
(Fig. 4a–d; P < 0.0001, rank-sum test; HSF-LSF difference > in PM than LM, P < 0.0001, 
rank-sum test).
Developmental changes in orientation tuning
Next we examined the development of orientation selectivity in V1, PM and LM neurons 
(for 0.04 cycles/deg, P20: n = 90 V1 cells, 50 LM cells, and 95 PM cells; P36: n = 286 V1 
cells, 178 LM cells, and 47 PM cells; for 0.32 cycles/deg P20: n=127 V1 cells, 44 LM cells, 
and 56 PM cells, P36: n = 191 V1 cells, 105 LM cells, and 39 PM cells; Fig. 5). The 
orientation selectivity index (OSI) significantly increased for all three areas for stimulation 
with LSF gratings (Fig. 5b, P < 0.0001 for all three areas). Our finding for V1 is consistent 
Smith et al.

 with a prior report32. When HSF gratings were used (Fig. 5c), OSI measurements showed a 
significant increase for LM neurons (P = 0.0001), a slight increase for PM neurons (P = 
0.03), and a small decrease for V1 neurons (P = 0.04). The modest developmental increase 
in OSI of PM neurons in response to HSF gratings should be considered in the context of 
already high OSI values for HSF at P20 which were comparable to that of P36 PM neurons 
in response to LSF gratings (mean ± SEM; PM, P20, HSF: 0.64 ± 0.18; PM, P36, LSF: 0.63 
± 0.19; P = 0.98, rank-sum test). Direction selectivity (as measured by the direction 
selectivity index, DSI) for both LSF and HSF gratings remained unchanged in LM or PM 
while V1 neurons showed a decrease in DSI for LSF gratings (P = 0.0002; Supplementary 
Fig. 6).
Developmental changes in receptive field (RF) maps
RF mapping can provide insights into basic wiring principles of visual circuitry33,34. We 
mapped the ON and OFF RF subregions of V1, PM, and LM neurons in P20 and P36 mice, 
using sparse noise stimuli and reverse correlation, as previously described33 (Fig. 6). 
Neurons in all three areas exhibited ON or OFF RF subregions (at P20: n = 19, 15, 14 ON 
subregions, and n = 41, 45, 12 OFF subregions for V1, LM, and PM, respectively; at P36: n 
= 23, 44, 7 ON subregions, and n = 48, 18, 10 OFF subregions for V1, LM, and PM, 
respectively). Structural measurements revealed that the RF subregion size of LM neurons 
was significantly larger in P36 mice compared to P20 mice, while those of V1 and PM 
neurons were indistinguishable (for LM, V1, and PM, respectively: P < 0.0001, P = 0.82, P 
= 0.75, ON and OFF RF subregions pooled). The LM RFs were larger along both the long 
and short axes, thus preserving the aspect ratio of the RFs similar between the ages (Fig. 6a–
d; Supplementary Fig. 7). Despite the spatial changes observed in LM, the RF subregions 
exhibited similar temporal characteristics. Specifically, the peak of the RF subregion 
strength in the reverse correlation analysis (the time difference between stimulus 
presentation and maximal influence on neuronal activity) was similar across areas, ages, and 
subregion signs (Supplementary Fig. 8). Finally, consistent with a prior report, we observed 
RF subregions in V1 that were precisely shared between different neurons33. Similarly, 
shared RF subregions were also observed in areas LM and PM (Fig. 6e,f).
DISCUSSION
One of the hallmarks of neocortex is the parcelization of parenchymal areas that act as 
functional units1,5. In this study, we measured responses in V1 and HVAs in developing 
mice. To our knowledge, this study provides the first characterization of the functional 
developmental trajectories of HVAs. We found functional correlations, development 
patterns, and sensitivities to dark rearing that distinguished putative dorsal stream HVAs 
(AM, PM, RL and AL) from the ventral stream HVAs (LM and LI). The delayed 
development of dorsal stream HVAs was also reflected in the development of receptive field 
properties on a single-cell level quantified using 2p calcium imaging. 2p calcium imaging 
also provided evidence that despite its relatively stable response strength, ventral stream 
circuitry continues to expand and integrate more inputs as reflected by the increase in its 
receptive field size during development. Together, these data indicate that as in primates, the

 two subnetworks of HVAs, dorsal and ventral stream circuitries, can be functionally and 
developmentally distinct in mice.
Functional and developmental basis for groupings of mouse HVAs
Anatomical projection patterns indicate that mouse HVAs can be grouped into two 
categories, broadly similar to the dorsal/ventral dichotomy seen in primates2,3. In the present 
study, ISOI enabled simultaneous imaging of functional activity across V1 and multiple 
HVAs in a single animal. This proved instrumental for detecting correlated activities among 
certain HVAs, and provided support for the functional grouping of HVAs into two 
subnetworks. Putative dorsal stream and ventral stream HVAs exhibited stronger correlated 
variations in the magnitude of their visual responses within their respective subnetworks 
than with HVAs in the complementary subnetwork. Closer look at the development of 
response strength by ISOI also highlighted distinct patterns for dorsal and ventral stream. 
While two ventral stream areas, LM and LI, both exhibited marked visual response 
immediately after eye-opening, dorsal stream areas, AM/PM, RL and AL showed prominent 
latency to mature. Notably, AL appeared slightly more developed at eye opening 
(Supplementary Fig. 5). This is congruent with a previous study that categorized AL to be 
part of the dorsal stream, but with characteristics somewhat intermediate between dorsal and 
ventral streams3. Differential developmental trajectories for higher visual processing have 
been observed in humans, where thresholds for global form processing and contour 
integration, two visual functions attributed to ventral stream pathway, reach adult levels at 
younger ages than thresholds for global motion processing, a dorsal stream function35. 
Perhaps motion processing circuitry requires a longer duration of visual experience for 
proper refinement than other types of computational circuitry. This refinement can include 
both changes in receptive field properties32,36 and changes in connectivity among V1 and 
HVAs20.
Differential development of single-cell level receptive field properties in PM and LM 
neurons
Calcium imaging in individual HVAs revealed markedly different developmental patterns of 
visual response properties at the single-cell level in areas PM and LM. Response magnitudes 
of PM neurons when presented with gratings significantly increased between P20 and P36, 
mirroring the ISOI results. The observed increase was more prominent for HSF than for 
LSF, consistent with prior reports of HSF preferences in PM compared to other HVAs18,19. 
However, the OSI of the PM neurons only mildly increased for LSF and remained stable for 
HSF. The OSI for the PM neurons for HSF gratings was already high at P20; thus, the lack 
of a further increase in OSI could be due to a ceiling effect. LM neurons, on the other hand, 
showed only modest increases in the response magnitude for LSF and HSF gratings, again 
mirroring the ISOI results. In contrast to area PM, however, the OSI of LM neurons 
sharpened for both spatial frequencies.
From our results emerges a picture for distinct patterns of circuit development in areas PM 
and LM. Visual responses in PM neurons are relatively late to develop, but as they do so, the 
responses are already sharply tuned for HSF gratings, possibly because the presynaptic 
inputs they receive are already highly tuned for HSF20. By contrast, the modest increase in

 response magnitude of LM neurons, combined with developmental sharpening of tuning for 
both LSF and HSF gratings, could reflect a combination of relative stability of net synaptic 
inputs and selective strengthening of inputs that match the tuning preferences of the neuron. 
Congruent with this idea, the average size of RF subregions of PM neurons remained stable 
between P20 and P36, while that of LM neurons increased significantly.
Experience-dependent development of HVAs
The distinct patterns of circuit development for PM and LM neurons could be related to 
different roles visual experience plays in sculpting circuitry in these areas. In particular, the 
prolonged developmental trajectory of visually evoked responses in dorsal stream HVAs 
provides a broad time window in which visual experience can influence the maturation of 
this circuitry. Indeed, through dark rearing experiments, we found that dorsal stream HVAs 
depend on visual experience for full development of visual responses, whereas ventral 
stream HVAs were more resistant. This stream-specific vulnerability is reminiscent of the 
“dorsal vulnerability hypothesis”37,38. Based on our findings, such vulnerability may stem 
from initial targeted innervation by select projections in PM neurons versus continued 
integration and refinement of inputs in LM neurons.
Our findings offer a scenario in which PM neurons are weakly innervated, strongly 
inhibited, or biophysically unresponsive to visually driven inputs early in development. 
Visual responses that subsequently develop post eye-opening are relatively stable in their 
selectivity, especially for HSF gratings. Thus, developmental refinement of synaptic inputs 
could occur through strengthening and/or integrating a fixed set of inputs that are tuned 
upstream of area PM. Indeed, axons projecting from V1 to PM have been shown to be 
specifically selective for HSF in adult mice20 (but note that the spatial frequency bias in area 
PM depends on an intact superior colliculus39). Perhaps, only those that are well tuned can 
reach PM during development rather than a large number of unselective inputs making 
contacts and later pruned. Because V1 tuning to HSF develops post eye-opening40, the 
innervation likely takes place during that time window as well. If deprived of early visual 
experience with DR, then the strengthening and/or further integration of the inputs are likely 
prohibited, making PM more vulnerable to DR.
LM neurons, on the other hand, are robustly innervated with visually responsive inputs early, 
near eye opening (~ P13), before visual experience can have much of an effect. 
Subsequently, RF subregions expand and tuning sharpens for both LSF and HSF gratings, 
yet overall response amplitudes change relatively modestly. Thus, further integration of new 
inputs that give rise to the expansion of RFs and the pruning of non-preferred inputs that 
results in the sharpening of tuning may balance each other out such that response amplitudes 
are kept relatively stable post eye-opening. One possible explanation for the relatively stable 
response amplitudes in LM neurons post DR is that these two opposing events of integration 
and pruning are either unaffected by DR or affected to a similar degree, resulting in LM 
being seemingly resistant to DR. Future studies can reveal how single cell level RF 
properties in HVAs are affected by DR41.

 Implications for visual deficiency and disorders
The delayed development and sensitivity to dark rearing of dorsal stream HVAs suggest that 
these areas are particularly vulnerable to postnatal insults and developmental disorders of 
activity-dependent circuit refinement. Recovery of higher visual processing following early 
blindness is often incomplete in humans42–44. Furthermore, deficits of activity-dependent 
circuit refinement have been implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders including Fragile 
X syndrome and autism45. Accordingly, sensory processing deficits have been added to the 
diagnostic criteria for autism spectrum disorder in DSM-5 (ref. 46). In particular, 
neurodevelopmental disorders are often accompanied by deficits in higher order visual 
processing. For example, in Fragile X syndrome, global motion perception attributed to 
dorsal stream function is impaired whereas acuity and global form recognition are normal47. 
Understanding the mechanisms for postnatal visual development as well as interrogating the 
V1 and HVA circuit deficits in the mouse models of these disorders would provide insights 
into the pathophysiology of these diseases. Our findings paint a complex picture, in which 
the two functionally discernible streams of visual pathway utilize distinct mechanisms for 
circuit development. Thus, therapeutic interventions towards circuit aberrations would likely 
require stream specific approaches.
METHODS
Animals and husbandry
All procedures involving living animals were carried out in accordance with the guidelines 
and regulations of the US Department of Health and Human Services and approved by the 
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at University of North Carolina. C57Bl/6 
mice and GCaMP6s expressing transgenic mice (Allen Institute like Ai96 crossed with 
Emx1-Cre line, Jackson Labs stock #005628) of both sexes (Taconic) were housed under 
12hr/12r dark light reverse cycle with ad libitum access to food and water. A subset of mice 
was reared in complete darkness from E14 to P40 ± 1 after which randomly selected some 
were immediately used and the remainder were further reared in the light until P65 ± 1. 
Infrared night vision goggles were used when servicing the mouse cages during dark 
rearing. Although it was impossible to completely blind experimenters during data gathering 
(e.g., younger mice are smaller), all subsequent quantification and analysis was performed 
blind to age and rearing conditions.
Randomization
For the developmental experiments, littermates within each litter were randomly assigned a 
different postnatal day for imaging. For DR experiments, littermates were randomly 
separated into dark-rearing until P65 vs. re-exposure to light from P45 through P65 groups.
Surgery
For acute imaging studies of developing mice, P13–18 pups were deeply anesthetized using 
isoflurane (5% for induction, 1–2% for surgery) augmented with chlorprothixene (2.5 mg/kg 
body weight, i.p.) as sedative. Physically-activated heat packs (SpaceGel, Braintree 
Scientific) were used to maintain the body temperature during surgery. The scalp overlaying

 right visual cortex was removed, and a custom head-fixing imaging chamber with 5-mm 
diameter opening was mounted to the skull with cyanoacrylate-based glue (Oasis Medical) 
and dental acrylic (Lang Dental). Mice were mounted on a holder via the chamber, which 
was filled with a physiological saline containing (in mM) 150 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 10 HEPES, 2 
CaCl2 and 1 MgCl2. All imaging for the juvenile pups (≤ P18) was performed transcranially. 
For acute imaging of mice aged ≥ P40, the surgery proceeded as detailed above followed by 
a 4-mm diameter craniotomy over visual cortex.
For chronic repeated imaging of developing animals, P19 mice were anesthetized using 
isoflurane (5% for induction, 1 – 2.0% for surgery) augmented with acepromazine (0 – 0.4 
mg/kg body weight, i.p.). A craniotomy was performed and sealed with a circular glass 
coverslip. Carprofen (4.4 mg/kg body weight, s.c.) was administered postoperatively to all 
mice that underwent recovery surgeries before returning to the home cage. The mice were 
imaged repeatedly every 4 days from P20 – P40.
Viral injections
Adeno-associated virus particles packaged and titered by the Penn Vector Core (~1012 
infectious units per ml; University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia) were used to overexpress 
genetically encoded calcium indicator, GCaMP6s (AAV1.Syn.GCaMP6s.WPRE.SV40). A 
craniotomy was performed as in for chronic imaging preps, and ISOI was used to map 
primary visual cortex (V1) and higher visual areas (HVAs) for targeted injections. In some 
experiments, ISOI was performed transcranially, and targeted burr holes were used for virus 
injections, in which case a craniotomy and optical window installation were carried out 4–6 
weeks post injection. Viral particles were injected (100 – 250 nL per site) with a pulled glass 
capillary micropipette using a Nanoliter 2010 controlled by a microprocessor, Micro4 
(World Precision Instruments) at 10 – 20 nL per minute. The glass pipette was left in place 
for 10 min before retracting to avoid backflushing of the injected solution. The cranial 
window was then sealed with a coverslip. Carprofen (4.4 mg per kg body weight, s.c.) was 
given postoperatively to all animals that underwent recovery surgeries before returning to 
their cage.
Intrinsic signal optical imaging (ISOI)
Custom instrumentation was adapted from Kalatsky and Stryker29, similar to our prior 
work26,28. Two F-mount lenses with respective focal lengths of 135 and 50 mm (Nikon) 
formed a tandem lens macroscope, which was attached to Dalsa 1M30 CCD camera 
(Teledyne DALSA), which is a large well depth camera, which offers high signal-to-noise 
measurements in bright light conditions such as this. The macroscope configuration 
provided a 4.6 mm × 4.6 mm field of view (21.2 mm2). Acquired images were binned 2 × 2 
spatially, resulting in a final pixel size of 9.2 μm × 9.2 μm. The pial vasculature was 
illuminated through a green filter (550 ± 50 nm, Edmund Optics) and the vasculature map 
was captured through a second green filter (560 ± 5 nm). From the pial surface, the 
macroscope was then focused down 600 μm where intrinsic signals were illuminated with 
halogen light (Asahi Spectra) delivered via light guides and focusing probes (Oriel) through 
a red filter (700 ± 38 nm, Chroma). Reflected light was captured through a second red filter 
(700 ± 5 nm, Edmund Optics) at the rate of 30 frames per second with custom-made image

 acquisition software (adapted from code kindly provided by D. Ferster, Northwestern 
University; to obtain this code contact either corresponding author). At 700 nm there is a 
large change in the absorption coefficient between oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin, 
and thus this contributes to the intrinsic signal measured in these experiments. Mice were 
headfixed 20 cm from a flat 60 cm × 34 cm (width × height) monitor which was tilted 
towards the mouse 17.5° from vertical with their head angled to their right to cover the 
visual field (110° by 75°) of the contralateral eye. A light anesthetic plane was maintained 
with 0.5% isoflurane during imaging, augmented with either chlorprothixene (2.5 mg/kg 
body weight, i.p.) or acepromazine (0.4 – 3.0 mg/kg body weight, i.p., the lower end of this 
range was used P20 mice), and the body temperature was kept at 37°C using feedback-
controlled electric heat pad systems (custom-built or FHC). Illumination stability was 
monitored by regular examination of individual pixel time courses to prevent this potential 
cause of imaging artifacts. In the case of unstable illumination, the imaging run was 
restarted. Mice were closely monitored for anesthetic depth as well. Increasing anesthetic 
depth decreases the signal strength, and complete wakefulness can cause imaging artifacts. 
These imaging artifacts appear to arise from large variations in cortical activity and blood 
vessel dilations and contractions that are uncorrelated with the stimulus, yet contain spectral 
strength that degrades the retinotopic map quality.
Visual stimuli
A drifting white bar on a black background (elevation and azimuth direction; 3° thick), 
drifting vertical grating patches (50° diameter, 2 cycles/s, 0.04 cycle/°), moving dots with 0 
or 30% direction coherence, and a small square stimuli (10° × 10°) with drifting gratings of 
rapidly cycling through four directions (2 cycles/s, 0.04 cycle/°, 0.5 s per direction) were 
produced and presented using MATLAB and the Psychophysics Toolbox48,49. A corrective 
distortion was applied to all the visual stimuli except for moving dot kinematograms using a 
custom 3D model based MATLAB code in order to compensate for the flatness of the 
monitor18 (code is available online, http://labrigger.com/blog/2012/03/06/mouse-visual-
stim/). Grating patch and moving dot kinematogram stimuli were restricted to a central 50° 
region of the monocular visual hemifield, for two reasons: (1) to ensure activation of medial 
and lateral HVAs23, and (2) to limit activation at the visual meridians that form the borders 
between cortical visual areas. Together, this is intended to minimize the influence of small 
expert-to-expert variations in the hand-drawn borders between HVAs based on retinotopy. 
Drifting motions occurred periodically for 50 repetitions at the last two seconds of an eight-
second period (the small square stimulus was displayed for 250 repetitions). The image 
acquisition software employed fast Fourier transfer analyses of each pixel column to identify 
stimuli-evoked signals at this frequency and generated maps of response magnitude and 
phase at 0.125 Hz.
During two-photon calcium imaging, the visual stimulus LCD screen was shrouded with a 
cone up to the eye of the mouse to prevent contamination of the imaging pathway with light 
from the visual stimulus. The visual stimulus extended from +20 – +124° in azimuth and 
from −10 – +42° in elevation. Stimulus frames (128 × 128 pixels) were smoothly 
interpolated so that 1 stimulus frame pixel was equivalent to 0.72°2 in visual space.

 For measuring orientation tuning, stimulus parameters were similar to a prior report50. 
Drifting square wave gratings (12 different directions, at 0.04 and 0.32 cycles/°, 2 Hz) were 
presented for 2 seconds at a time, with 2 seconds of grey screen (to maintain mean 
luminance) between grating presentations. For receptive field mapping, stimulus parameters 
were similar to a prior report33, using a different random number generator seed for the 
stimulus generation algorithm. Sparse-noise visual stimuli consisted of black and white dots 
on a gray background. Dots ranged in size from 1.3–8.0° in diameter. Adjacent frames had 
no overlap in dot locations so that all pixel transitions were to or from gray, never from black 
to white or vice versa. Between 4,000 and 6,000 stimulus frames were used in each 
experiment. Total mapping time was 30–45 min.
Two-photon (2p) microscopy imaging
Ca2+ transients reported by GCaMP6s were imaged over 6 weeks post AAV injection 
(ISOI/2p calibration experiments) or at two developmental time points, P20 and P36, in 
GCaMP6s expressing transgenic mice, using a custom-built two-photon microscope using 
galvanometer-based scan mirrors (6mm diameter, Cambridge Technologies) with a 16 x 
magnification and 0.8 numerical aperture water immersion objective (Nikon) and a large 
aperture collection pathway with GaAsP photomultiplier tubes (Hamamatsu). Frame scans 
(1 frame/s or 15.6 frames/s) were acquired using ScanImage51.
ISOI image analysis
Retinotopic maps were used to locate V1 and HVAs. Borders between these areas were 
drawn at the meridian of elevation and azimuth retinotopy. Magnitude response maps were 
also consulted for reconfirmation. ImageJ software (Fiji distribution52) was used to quantify 
response amplitudes at each region of interest (ROI). To exclude from analysis portions of 
cortex in the magnitude maps that did not significantly respond to the stimulus, a 
background magnitude value was determined and used as a threshold, called “background 
threshold”. For each image, the background threshold was determined on a 5×5 Gaussian-
filtered image. Measurements were made for each ROI, from which the background 
threshold values were subtracted. Quantifications from this approach were highly 
reproducible between experts (Supplementary Fig. 1). For PCA analysis, 22-dimensional 
vectors were constructed (each mouse is one dimension) for each HVA. These 22-
dimensional vectors were expressed as a linear combination of two principle components 
and plotted. Dorsal and ventral stream areas separated in the sign of the eigenvalue for the 
second principle component, for both responses to gratings and kinematograms (Component 
2; Fig. 1i,j).
2p image analysis
Regions of interest (neuron locations in the image data) were identified using a semi-
automated method. After spatiotemporal Gaussian filtering, the kurtosis of each pixel’s time 
course was computed. This creates a 2D map with contrast at neuron borders. This 2D map 
was binarized with a locally adaptive threshold, and potential regions of interest were 
automatically identified. Then, all data were examined manually to exclude artifacts and 
misidentified regions.

 To ensure exclusion of low fidelity data, only neurons that exhibited at some point in the 
data set at least one event that exceeded 60% delta F/F were subjected to detailed analysis of 
tuning. For a neuron to be classified as tuned to oriented gratings, it had to respond to one of 
the grating types (direction and spatial frequency) on at least two of six trials32. For that 
metric, a “response” was an increase in fluorescence signal in excess of three standard 
deviations of the noise floor (measured during grey screen presentation). An ANOVA was 
performed to detect significantly tuned neurons for subsequent analysis. Responses from 
orientation tuned cells were averaged over trials and fit with a Gaussian function to extract 
OSI measurements as before53.
Analysis of RF mapping was performed similar to a prior report33. Briefly, fluorescence 
time courses were deconvolved into estimated spike rates. Reverse correlation between 
estimate spike rates and sparse noise visual stimuli yielded separate maps of ON and OFF 
RF subregions. These raw subregions were z-scored and filtered. The resulting maps were 
thresholded (± 4 z-score) to obtain binarized maps that were analyzed to detect shared 
subregions33. To obtain measurements of subregion sizes, the binarized maps were used 
directly for area measurements; mean radius and long and short axes measurements were 
taken from elliptical fits of the binarized maps.
Statistical analysis
All quantifications were carried out blind to age and, in the dark rearing experiments, 
experimental conditions. In acute experiments, pups from individual litters were used for 
multiple time points. One mouse used for calcium imaging (identification code #67) was 
imaged at P20, but by P36 the window was no longer transparent enough for imaging. An 
additional mouse (identification code #68) was incorporated to make up for the loss of the 
one mouse. Custom software for Igor Pro (Wavemetrics) and MATLAB (MathWorks) were 
used to compute Pearson’s R, two-way t-tests, and non-parametric rank-sum tests. Some P-
values were computed to be extremely small (e.g., < 10−200), however, it is difficult to assign 
meaning to such small values, so we chose to express P-values that are less than 0.0001 as 
that bound rather than their actual calculated value. JMP, Version 10.0.1 (SAS Institute) was 
used to compute ANOVA and Tukey-Kramer HSD, and to perform the correlation and PCA 
analyses. For correlation and PCA analyses, cortical areas were not grouped a priori, with 
the exception of areas AM and PM which were analyzed as a single region because the 
meridian between them was not always clearly resolved in retinotopic maps from ISO 
imaging. No statistical methods were used to pre-determine sample sizes but our sample 
sizes are similar to those reported in previous publications3,20. Data distribution is shown in 
each figure and was assumed to be normal, but this was not formally tested. In all figures, 
error bars and error clouds (shaded regions) indicate S.E.M.
To examine whether the effect size of the DR is stronger in certain HVAs, we analyzed the 
data using repeated measures ANOVA with the condition, HVA, and their interaction in the 
model with repeated measures (repeated response in each HVA) with an unstructured 
covariance matrix. The reference level for condition is the magnitude of response at age P65. 
The reference level for HVAs is RL.
We fit the model:

To read the table, take the first line: AL vs. LI (40C-40DR). The difference between 40C and 
40 DR is 0.1590 greater in the AL group compared to the LI group. This means that the dark 
rearing effect size was larger in AL group, but this result wasn’t significant (P = 0.3677). By 
contrast, for AL vs. LM, the estimate was 0.2407 with a P-value of 0.0319. Therefore, DR 
effect size was significantly larger in AL compared to LM.

 Summary
Vison is processed across multiple cortical areas that are organized into two subnetworks 
in primates. However, the generality of this organization and its development are unclear. 
Smith and colleagues present functional evidence for the analogous two subnetworks in 
mice, and map their differential developmental dynamics.

 Figure 1. Mapping and functional grouping of putative dorsal and ventral stream higher visual 
areas (HVAs) in mice
(a) Schematic view of the cortical location of V1 and HVAs in the right hemisphere, 
assigned to putative dorsal and ventral streams following the work of Burkhalter, Wang, and 
colleagues2,3. (b) Intrinsic optical signals were measured as decreases in the reflectance of 
red (700 nm) light as cortical regions were activated, measured using a tandem lens 
macroscope and a CCD camera. The visual stimulus monitor was tilted towards the mouse, 
and covered 110° of horizontal, and 75° of vertical visual field. The mouse was centered in 
front of the monitor, with its nose pointed towards the right side, to maximize coverage of 
the left visual hemifield. To map retinotopy, a single white bar drifted across the screen 
(horizontal or vertical, warped to ensure isoelevation and isoazimuth activation patterns). (c) 
Elevation and (d) azimuth maps revealed the meridians of retinotopy that form the borders 
among visual cortical areas. Cortex is color-coded according to the location of the bar on the 
monitor at the time of the evoked visual response. The locations of HVAs were drawn based 
on these retinotopic maps for each mouse individually. Rigid templates were not used. (e) To 
further confirm the location of HVAs, gratings were displayed in small square apertures, and 
the resulting activation pattern was used to locate retinotopically active areas in V1 and 
HVAs. Two maps were generated, each with the aperture in a different azimuthal location on 
the monitor (color-coded green and violet). (f) The spatial relationship between the two 
evoked maps matched the predictions from the (c) elevation and (d) azimuth retinotopic 
maps. (g,h) Maps evoked by stimulation with gratings (g) or kinematograms (h) both 
exhibited responses that were significantly correlated among dorsal stream HVAs, and 
among ventral stream HVAs, but less correlated between the two streams. (i,j) Principal 
component analysis (22-dimensional vectors for n = 22 mice), carried out independently for 
maps from (i) gratings and (j) kinematograms, indicated that dorsal and ventral stream HVAs 
exhibit correlated variability. These analyses provide functional evidence that AL, RL, and 
AM/PM belong to one subnetwork, and LM and LI belong to another. Correlation values 
and statistics are shown in Supplementary Table 1.

 Figure 2. Functional responses in dorsal stream areas develop more slowly and are more 
dependent on experience than in ventral stream areas
(a) Responses in V1 and HVAs were measured (b) at ages P13 through P36. For P13–P18, 
data were taken from acute preparations (a single time point per mouse, 2 consecutive ages 
pooled as shown), and for P20–P36 as chronic preparations (multiple time points per 
mouse). Retinotopic maps defined the locations of V1 and HVAs within each mouse and 
time point. (c) Responses to drifting gratings rapidly matured in ventral stream HVAs 
whereas visually evoked responses in dorsal stream HVAs were slower to develop. (d) 
Responses to random dot kinematograms in ventral stream HVAs were strong early after eye 
opening, but those in dorsal stream HVAs were weaker and grew more slowly in magnitude. 
(e) One set of mice (“Dark reared” or “DR”) were reared in complete darkness from E14 to 
P40, and compared to normally reared P40 mice. Another set of mice (“Recovery”) were 
also dark-reared to P40, but then were provided 25 days of normal light-dark cycle housing. 
These mice were compared to normally reared P65 mice. Multiple litters were used for each 
group. (f,g) Example maps show that evoked responses of dorsal stream HVAs in DR and 
Recovery mice were weak compared to control mice at the same ages. (h) In both dark 
reared and recovery mice, dorsal stream HVAs exhibited significantly weaker responses,

 Figure 3. Visually evoked responses measured as ISOI signals correlate with action potential-
associated calcium signals
To validate the quantitative measurements from ISOI signals, visually evoked cortical 
activity was measured in the same mice using both ISOI and 2-photon (2p) calcium imaging. 
(a) A square wave grating stimulus (drifting for 2 s, stationary for 6 s) evoked activity in V1 
and HVAs, and the average change in reflectance (ΔR/R) over 50 repetitions was recorded 
via ISOI. (b) Population activity, with single neuron resolution, was measured using 2p 
calcium imaging of neurons. Example images show V1 and LM neurons expressing 
GCaMP6s. The same visual stimulus was used. Example traces show responses from 6 
neurons (circled and color coded in the images on the left) to 50 repetitions of the stimulus 
used to measure the average probability of response to the stimulus in V1 and LM (grey bars 
indicate the 2 seconds during which the grating drifted). (c) The ratios of responsiveness 
between two cortical areas were the same whether measured with ISOI or 2p calcium 
imaging (n = 10 cortical areas, 5 intra-mouse comparisons, 3 mice; Pearson’s R = 0.92; P = 
0.027). Data from panels (a) and (b) are represented by the blue data point. The other 
colored points represent different pairs of cortical areas as indicated in the inset. Thus, ISOI 
provides a faithful report of evoked activity in V1 and HVAs simultaneously.

 Figure 4. Response magnitude increases in areas PM and LM from P20 to P36 measure with 2p 
calcium imaging
(a) With 0.04 cycle/degree gratings, response magnitudes to oriented gratings in area LM 
increased from P20 to P36, (b) while a larger increase occurred for neurons in area PM. (c,d) 
With 0.32 cycle/degree gratings, response magnitudes increased for both LM and PM from 
P20 to P36. Again, the relative increase for area PM was larger than the increase for neurons 
in area LM. Shaded regions indicate SEM.

 Figure 6. Receptive field subregion changes in areas V1, LM, and PM from P20 to P36
(a) RF subregions were mapped using sparse noise visual stimulation. Reverse correlation 
was used with the white and black dots separately to independently recover the ON and OFF 
RF subregions. (b) Example RF subregions for areas V1, LM, and PM at ages P20 and P36. 
(c) Both ON and OFF subregions increased in size in area LM between P20 and P36. 
Similar increases were not detected in areas V1 or PM. (d) Aspect ratios of RF subregions 
did not significantly change between P20 and P36. (e) Shared RF subregions were observed 
in areas V1, LM, and PM at both P20, and (f) P36. Each box plot in (c,d) indicates the
