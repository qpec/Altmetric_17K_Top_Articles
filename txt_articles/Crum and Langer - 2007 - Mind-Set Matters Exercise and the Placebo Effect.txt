Mind-Set Matters
Exercise and the Placebo Effect
Alia J. Crum and Ellen J. Langer

ABSTRACT—In a study testing whether the relationship
between exercise and health is moderated by one’s mind-
set, 84 female room attendants working in seven different
hotels were measured on physiological health variables
affected by exercise. Those in the informed condition
were told that the work they do (cleaning hotel rooms) is
good exercise and satisfies the Surgeon General’s recom-
mendations for an active lifestyle. Examples of how their
work was exercise were provided. Subjects in the control
group were not given this information. Although actual
behavior did not change, 4 weeks after the intervention,
the informed group perceived themselves to be getting
significantly more exercise than before. As a result, com-
pared with the control group, they showed a decrease in
weight, blood pressure, body fat, waist-to-hip ratio, and
body mass index. These results support the hypothesis that
exercise affects health in part or in whole via the placebo
effect.
The placebo effect is any effect that is not attributed to an actual
pharmaceutical drug or remedy, but rather is attributed to the
individual’s mind-set (mindless beliefs and expectations). The
therapeutic benefit of the placebo effect is so widely accepted
that accounting for it has become a standard in clinical drug
trials to distinguish pharmaceutical effects from the placebo
effect and the placebo effect from other possible confounding
factors, including spontaneous remission and the natural history
of the condition (Benson & McCallie, 1979; Brody, 1980; Nes-
bitt Shanor, 1999; Spiro, 1986). Kirsh and Sapirstein (1998), in a
meta-analysis of 2,318 clinical drug trials for antidepressant
medication, found that a quarter (25.16%) of the patients’ re-
sponses were due to the actual drug effect, another quarter
(23.87%) were due to the natural history of depression, and half
(50.97%) were due to the placebo effect.
The placebo effect extends much further than medications or
therapy: Subjects exposed to fake poison ivy developed real
rashes1 (Blakeslee, 1998), people imbibing placebo caffeine
experienced increased motor performance and heart rate (and
other effects congruent with the subjects’ beliefs and not with the
pharmacological effects of caffeine; Kirsch & Sapirstein, 1998),
and patients given anesthesia and a fake knee operation ex-
perienced reduced pain and swelling in their ‘‘healed’’ tendons
and ligaments (Blakeslee, 1998). More generally, studies sug-
gest that 60 to 90% of drugs and other therapies prescribed by
physicians depend on the placebo effect for their effectiveness
(Benson & Freedman, 1996; Nesbitt Shanor, 1999).
The placebo effect does not have to involve inert pills or
sham procedures. Symbols, beliefs, and expectations can elicit
powerful physiological occurrences, both positive and negative
(Hahn & Kleinman, 1983; Roberts, Kewman, & Mercie, 1993).
For example, the mere presence of a doctor increases patients’
blood pressure (the ‘‘white coat effect’’), reinterpreting pain in
nonthreatening ways (e.g., as sensations) prompts patients to
take fewer sedatives and leave the hospital sooner; and the
health decline of cancer patients often has less to do with the
actual course of the illness and more to do with their negative
expectations regarding the disease (Langer, 1989).
EXERCISE AND THE PLACEBO EFFECT
As the most common health threats are now infectious rather
than chronic, remedies have also changed. Doctors now pre-
scribe behavioral changes such as exercise for chronic diseases
like diabetes, heart disease, and even cancer. We wondered
whether the well-known benefits of exercise are in whole or in
part the result of the placebo effect. A positive finding would
speak to the potentially powerful psychological control people
have over their health.
There is evidence supporting the idea that the placebo effect
plays a role in occasioning the psychological benefits associated
with exercise (Desharnais, Jobin, Cote, Levesque, & Godin,

1When negative expectations are met with negative results, the placebo effect
is often called the nocebo effect (Hahn, 1997).

Desharnais et al. conducted an experiment on 48 healthy young
adults engaged in a supervised 10-week exercise program. Half
of the subjects (the experimental condition) were led to believe
that the program was specifically designed to improve psycho-
logical well-being. The other half were not told anything about
these benefits; instead, the emphasis was on the biological as-
pect of the program. Although the results showed similar in-
creases in fitness in the two conditions, the subjects in the
experimental condition showed a significant increase in self-
esteem.
Although studies have yet to investigate whether the per-
ception of physical activity and resulting beliefs about one’s
health have effects on the physiological benefits associated with
physical activity, several studies allude to the possibility. Health
perceptions have been related to actual health. For example,
Kaplan and Camacho (1983), in a cohort study of 6,928 adults,
found that perceived health was a better predictor of mortality
than actual health. Idler and Kasl (1991) concluded that elderly
persons who perceive their health as poor are 6 times more likely
to die than those who perceive their health as excellent, re-
gardless of actual health status.
Further support for the possibility of the placebo effect in the
benefits of exercise comes from the fact that the numerous
studies linking exercise to health have generally relied on self-
reported information to measure physical activity (Plante &
Rodin, 1990); the results of these studies therefore reflect the
relationship between health and perceived levels of physical
activity, rather than actual levels. This raises the question of
whether some of the positive gains of physical activity are due
more to the perception of exercise and its association with health
than to the actual performance of exercise.
In the study we report here, we investigated the role of the
placebo effect (the moderating role of mind-set) in the rela-
tionship between exercise and health. We hypothesized that the
placebo effect plays a role in the health benefits of exercise: that
one’s mind-set mediates the connection between exercise and
one’s health. If this hypothesis is true, increasing perceived
exercise, independent of actual exercise, would be expected to
result in subsequent health benefits (a placebo effect).
METHOD
Logic
The Surgeon General has stated that all adults should accu-
mulate at least 30 min of physical exercise per day for a healthy
lifestyle (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC,
1996). Everyday moderate physical activity can be achieved by
taking a brisk walk, climbing the stairs, or performing active
housework (CDC, 1996). Although many people today have
sedentary jobs, there are some jobs that are intrinsically phys-
ical. Hotel room attendants, for example, clean on average 15
rooms a day (each room taking between 20 and 30 min to
complete), and engage in exerting activities that require walk-
ing, bending, pushing, lifting, and carrying, clearly meeting and
exceeding the Surgeon General’s requirements. Room attend-
ants may not perceive their work as exercise. If they do not, and
if the relationship between exercise and health is moderated by
mind-set as we hypothesize, then these workers may not be re-
ceiving the full health benefits of their exercise. Similarly, if
their mind-sets are shifted so that they become aware of the
exercise they are getting, then health improvements would be
expected to follow.
Design
Each of seven hotels was randomly assigned to one of two con-
ditions: informed or control.
Subjects in the informed condition received a write-up dis-
cussing the benefits of exercise and were informed that their
daily housekeeping work satisfied the CDC’s recommendations
for an active lifestyle. Specifically, they were told that exercise
does not need to be hard or painful to be good for one’s health,
but that it is simply a matter of moving one’s muscles and
burning calories (accumulating approximately 200 calories per
day to meet the recommendations). They were given specific
details of the average calorie expenditure for various activities
(changing linens for 15 min burns 40 calories, vacuuming for 15
min burns 50 calories, and cleaning bathrooms for 15 min burns
60 calories), and they were told that although these figures were
based on results for a 140-pound woman and each of them would
burn calories at a different rate, it was clear that they were easily
meeting and even exceeding the Surgeon General’s recom-
mendations.2 This sheet, written in both English and Spanish,
was read and explained to the subjects and then posted on the
bulletin board in their lounge.3
The subjects were told we were interested in getting infor-
mation on their health so that we could study ways to improve it,
and in return for helping, they would receive information about
research on health and happiness.
Subjects in the control group were given all the same infor-
mation as those in the informed group except they did not re-
ceive information about how their work is good exercise until
after the second set of measures was taken (see Procedure).
Subjects
Subjects were recruited through hotels. To prevent information
contamination, we assigned all room attendants within a hotel to
the same condition. Four hotels were assigned to the informed
2This information is based on extensively researched recommendations for
exercise and calorie expenditure made by the CDC, American College of Sports
Medicine, and Surgeon General (Pate, Pratt, Blair, et al., 1995, as cited in CDC,
1996).

had a designated and qualified supervisor to translate the verbal information
and instruction to the subjects.

 condition, and three were assigned to the control condition. The
hotels were matched for similarity: The two same-franchise
hotels, the two condominium-type hotels, and the two unique,
luxury hotels were in different conditions. The hotels did not
differ with respect to managerial structure, and all followed the
Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) codes and did not dis-
criminate on the basis of age, gender, ethnic background, reli-
gious background, or sexual orientation, although all subjects
in this study were female. No information regarding subjects’
characteristics (age or ethnicity) was known when the hotels
were assigned to the conditions.
In total, 84 subjects completed both sets of measures (44 in
the informed group, 40 in the control group). The subjects’ ages
ranged from 18 to 55 years, and most were Hispanic, although
some were Caucasian, African American, and Asian. All worked
32 to 40 hr per week and cleaned approximately 15 rooms per
day. Statistical analysis revealed that at the onset of the inves-
tigation, the groups did not differ significantly except in age.4
This unexpected difference was controlled for in all analyses.
Procedure
All subjects were told that the purpose of the study was to find
ways to improve the health and happiness of women in a hotel
workplace. Each subject was given a questionnaire, and while
the subjects were filling it out, they were taken one at a time to
complete their physiological measures. The informed group was
then given the information about how their work is good exer-
cise; this information was conveyed in the form of a verbal
presentation, through individual handouts, and on larger posters
tacked to the bulletin boards in their lounge in the hope that they
would be reminded of how much exercise they were getting each
day. The control group was not given this information.
Four weeks later, we returned to take the same measures, and
all subjects were debriefed both orally and in writing. Each
session took approximately 1 hr.
Measures
Self-Reported Exercise
The study was designed to instigate an increase in perceived
exercise independent of actual exercise. Self-reported exercise
was assessed through a series of questions. First, subjects were
asked to check ‘‘yes’’ or ‘‘no’’ to indicate whether or not they
exercised regularly (perceived regular exercise). Second, they
used a scale from 0 to 10 to rate how much exercise they got
(perceived amount of exercise). Following these questions, they
were asked to describe how they got their exercise. These de-
scriptions were used for the measures of perceived work as ex-
ercise (i.e., whether or not subjects referenced their work) and
exercise outside of work (i.e., whether or not subjects named
activities such as swimming, running, doing sit ups, or other
non-work-related activities). Additional questions asked how
often subjects attended a gym and whether or not they walked to
work each day.
It was assumed, and later confirmed by the hotel house-
keeping managers, that the workload of the room attendants
remained constant in the 30 days prior to and the 30 days during
the study. Therefore, if there was no increase in reported exer-
cise outside of work, any increase in perceived regular exercise,
perceived amount of exercise, or perceived work as exercise
would be assumed to reflect a change in mind-set initiated by the
intervention and not due to an increase in actual exercise.
Dependent Variables: Physiological Measures
Weight and percentage of body fat were measured using the
Tanita Body Fat Monitor/Scale (Model UM-026, Tanita Manu-
facturing Co., Tokyo, Japan). In addition to giving a normal
weight reading (to the closest 1/10 pound), this model measures
body fat using a simplified version of bioelectrical impedance
analysis that uses leg-to-leg bioimpedance analysis. After
weight and impedance are measured, computer software (a
microprocessor) embedded in the product uses the measured
impedance, the subject’s weight, and the subject’s gender,
height, and age (which are entered in) to determine the per-
centage of body fat and body water, according to equation for-
mulas. Tanita’s standard formulas have been derived by multiple
regression analysis, using the institutional standard, dual-en-
ergy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA), as a reference.5
Body mass index (BMI) was calculated after the fact using the
following equation: [(weight in pounds)/(height in inches �
height in inches)] � 703. BMI expresses weight as adjusted for
height.
Waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) was measured by a tape measure
and calculated as the waist circumference divided by the hip
circumference. Waist measurements were taken at the midpoint
between the upper iliac crest and lower costal margin in the
midaxillary line (the narrowest point of the waist). Hip cir-
cumference was measured at the largest point around the but-
tocks or gluteofemoral fold.
Blood pressure (BP) was measured using the HEM-711AC
OMRON Automatic Blood Pressure Monitor with IntelliSense
(Omron Co., Tokyo, Japan). The OMRON monitor uses the
oscillometric method of BP measurement, detecting blood’s
movement through the brachial artery and converting it to a
digital reading of systolic and diastolic blood pressure.
4Subjects in the informed group (mean age 5 34.12, SD 5 9.23) were sig-
nificantly younger than subjects in the control group (mean age 5 42.40, SD 5
12.54), F(1, 81) 5 11.86, prep 5 .986.
5Initial and final measurements were taken at the same time of day (morning).
(Body-fat readings are normally highest in the morning; therefore, because
measures were taken in the morning, these readings may be higher than nor-
mal.) In addition, measures were taken 4 weeks apart to eliminate the hydration
fluctuation involved in a woman’s menstruation cycle. Clothing weight was
accounted for by virtue of the fact that the women wore the same uniforms at the
two sessions.

 Dependent Variables: Behavioral Measures
In addition to assessing changes in exercise outside of work
(including gym attendance, walking to work, or other non-work-
related physical activities), we assessed substance abuse and
diet through questions asking subjects to reflect on their habits
over the past 30 days, including how much they ate relative to
their normal intake, how many cigarettes they smoked, how
many servings of vegetables and sugary foods they ate, and how
many glasses of caffeinated beverages, alcoholic beverages, and
water they drank.
RESULTS
Change in Self-Reported Exercise
Subjects’ self-reported exercise was examined using 2 (time:
Time 1, Time 2; within subjects) � 2 (condition: control, in-
formed; between subjects) repeated measures analyses of vari-
ance (ANOVAs). These analyses yielded no significant effects
for exercise outside of work. Perceived amount of exercise,
however, showed main effects of time, F(1, 65) 5 6.80, prep 5
.955, Z2 5 .10, and condition, F(1, 65) 5 4.79, prep 5 .910, Z2
5 .07, which were qualified by a significant interaction, F(1, 65)
5 6.34, prep 5 .955, Z2 5 .09 (see Table 1). Simple effects tests
demonstrated that subjects in the informed condition reported
higher levels of perceived amount of exercise at Time 2 than did
subjects in the control condition, t(38) 5 6.72, prep > .99,
whereas there were no significant differences between condi-
tions at Time 1, t(52) 5 0.40, prep 5 .749. Similar results were
found for perceived regular exercise and perceived work as
exercise. Thus, the experimental group increased their per-
ceived exercise over the course of the study, whereas the control
group did not, and neither group increased their actual levels of
activity. Table 1 shows the means and standard deviations for
these changes, which are illustrated graphically in Figure 1.

icant differences were found in diastolic BP. Table 1 presents the

Change in Dependent Variables: Behavioral Measures
As mentioned, repeated measures ANOVAs yielded no signifi-
cant effects for subjects’ responses regarding exercise outside of
work. Similarly, there were no significant changes in subjects’
substance abuse and diet.
DISCUSSION
Mind-Set Matters
This study did not test the placebo effect in the traditional
manner, in which expectations are aroused through inert pills or
sham procedures. Rather, subjects were actually engaging in a
behavior that is clinically proven to have positive effects on the
physiological variables measured (e.g., CDC, 1996; Hubert,
Feinleib, McNamara, & Castelli, 1983; Lee, Manson, Henne-
kens, & Paffenbarger, 1993; Press, Freestone, & George, 2003;
Raglan & Morgan, 1987; Schnohr, Scharling, & Jensen, 2003;
Tipton, 1984). To determine if the placebo effect plays a role in
the benefits of exercise, this study investigated whether sub-
jects’ mind-set (in this case, their perceived levels of exercise)
could inhibit or enhance the health benefits of exercise inde-
pendently of actual exercise.
Although it is clear that the room attendants studied met or
exceeded the Surgeon General’s recommendations for physical

 activity, initial measures suggest that the subjects were not
aware that their work is good exercise. At the onset of the ex-
periment, 66.6% of subjects reported not exercising regularly,
and 36.8% reported not getting any exercise. Interestingly, the
health of the room attendants reflected their perceived levels of
exercise rather than their actual levels: According to their initial
physiological measures, the subjects were at risk with respect to
BP, BMI, percentage of body fat, and WHR—all important in-
dicators of health. These results suggest the possibility that at
the onset of the study, the room attendants were not receiving the

 full benefits of their exercise because they were not aware that
they were getting exercise at work. Of course, there may have
been many confounding reasons (e.g., genetics or diet) why these
women were unhealthy despite their intense activity levels.
Over the course of the study, the percentage of informed
subjects who reported exercising regularly (perceived regular
exercise) doubled (39.4% to 79.4%), and the average amount of
exercise that subjects in the informed group believed them-
selves to be getting (perceived amount of exercise) increased by
more than 20%. It is important to note that although the in-
formed room attendants did report higher levels of exercise at
the end of the study, they did not report getting any additional
exercise outside of work. In addition, although the subjects in
the informed group showed a significant increase in recognizing
their work as a form of exercise, their actual workload did not
change. Thus, the changes in reported physical activity appear
to be attributable not to actual increases in physical activity, but
to a shift in mind-set initiated by the information given to them in
the intervention.
This shift in mind-set in the informed group was accompanied
by remarkable improvement in physiological measures associ-
ated with exercise. After only 4 weeks of knowing that their work
is good exercise, the subjects in the informed group lost an av-
erage of 2 pounds,6 lowered their systolic BP by 10 points,7 and
were significantly healthier as measured by body-fat percent-
age, BMI, and WHR. These were small but meaningful changes
given the state of health the subjects were in, especially con-
sidering that the change occurred in just 4 weeks. All of these
changes were significantly greater than the changes in the
control group. These results support our hypothesis that in-
creasing perceived exercise independently of actual exercise
results in subsequent physiological improvements.
But How?
How exactly did the change in mind-set bring about such sig-
nificant physiological changes? Conventional science assumes
that in order for weight to be lost and body fat to be reduced,
certain biological and physiological events must also take place.
In the case of BP, it is assumed that it is lowered during exercise
because the peripheral blood vessels are dilated, and that, over
time, the attenuating effect of exercise on the sympathetic
nervous system’s activity helps to reduce rennin-angiotensin
system activity, reset baroreceptors, and promote arterial va-
sodilation (which helps to control BP; CDC, 1996). In the case of
weight, it is assumed that exercise helps to reduce body fat by
increasing energy expenditure: To the extent that energy ex-
penditure exceeds caloric intake, the result is weight loss
(theoretically, about 1 pound of fat energy is lost for each
additional 3,500 kilocalories burned; CDC, 1996).
Given this knowledge, one interpretation of our results re-
garding the relationship between increased perceived exercise
and improved health would be that they were mediated by a
change in behavior. The data collected in this study, however, do
not support this conclusion. As mentioned, the room attendants
did not report any increase in exercise outside of work, nor did
they experience any increase in workload over the course of the
study. In addition, the subjects reported their habits had not
changed over the past 30 days with respect to how much they ate
(including servings of sugary foods and vegetables) and how
much they drank (caffeine, alcohol, and water). Thus, neither
increased exercise nor decreased caloric intake was reported
by the subjects.
Of course, it is possible that the room attendants actually did
change their behavior—actually did cut back on calories, im-
prove the quality of the food they ate, or work harder or more
energetically—but did not report such changes.8 However,
previous research has found it very difficult to change behavior
of this sort (Deutschman, 2005). Thus, even if these behavioral
changes did occur as a result of the intervention, that too would
make these results interesting.
In summary, the data collected in this study, coupled with
previous research indicating the difficulty of changing behavior,
make it unlikely that the relationship between mind-set and
improvements in health was mediated by a change in behavior.
In either case, whether the change in physiological health was
brought about directly or indirectly, it is clear that health is
significantly affected by mind-set.
IMPLICATIONS AND FUTURE RESEARCH
The results of this study provide another example of the power of
the placebo effect. The moderating role of mind-set and its
ability to enhance health should be identified further, substan-
tiated, and utilized. The present results may have particular
relevance for treating diseases associated with a sedentary
lifestyle.
There is still no generally accepted, scientifically grounded
model substantiating the relationship between mind-set and
health, although several models have been proposed (see Lov-
allo, 2005). The present findings warrant investigation in this
area.
6The fact that these subjects significantly reduced body-fat percentage in
addition to significantly losing weight makes the weight loss even more im-
portant because it indicates that these women lost body fat rather than water
weight.
7In an effort to make BP readings as reliable as possible, we controlled for
several variables that are known to cause fluctuation: substance abuse (subjects
reported no significant changes in alcohol, caffeine, or tobacco use during the
study), diet (subjects reported no significant change in diet), time of day (BP
was taken at the same time of day in the two sessions), hormonal regulation (BP
was taken 4 weeks apart to control for fluctuation due to menstruation), heart
rate (there was no significant difference in heart rate between Time 1 and Time
2), and immediate physical activity (BP was measured both times after subjects
had been sitting for at least 10 min, to ensure that resting BP was measured).
8Future research might benefit from using measures (e.g., pedometers, food
journals, or other people’s assessment of diet and activity levels) to enhance
control for these variables.

Exercise and the Placebo Effect
 People have mindlessly overlooked what it means that pla-
cebos are inert. Ultimately, each individual is responsible for
their effects. Recognizing this suggests that it is time for us all to
explore more direct means of controlling our health, such as
pursuing mindfulness (see Langer, 1989) as a tool to actively and
deliberately change our mind-sets.
