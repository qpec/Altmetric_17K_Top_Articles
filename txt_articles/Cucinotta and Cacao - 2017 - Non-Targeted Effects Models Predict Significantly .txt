Non-Targeted Effects Models 
Predict Significantly Higher Mars 
Mission Cancer Risk than Targeted 
Effects Models
Francis A. Cucinotta & Eliedonna Cacao
Cancer risk is an important concern for galactic cosmic ray (GCR) exposures, which consist of a wide-
energy range of protons, heavy ions and secondary radiation produced in shielding and tissues. Relative 
biological effectiveness (RBE) factors for surrogate cancer endpoints in cell culture models and tumor 
induction in mice vary considerable, including significant variations for different tissues and mouse 
strains. Many studies suggest non-targeted effects (NTE) occur for low doses of high linear energy 
transfer (LET) radiation, leading to deviation from the linear dose response model used in radiation 
protection. Using the mouse Harderian gland tumor experiment, the only extensive data-set for dose 
response modelling with a variety of particle types (>4), for the first-time a particle track structure 
model of tumor prevalence is used to investigate the effects of NTEs in predictions of chronic GCR 
exposure risk. The NTE model led to a predicted risk 2-fold higher compared to a targeted effects model. 
The scarcity of data with animal models for tissues that dominate human radiation cancer risk, including 
lung, colon, breast, liver, and stomach, suggest that studies of NTEs in other tissues are urgently 
needed prior to long-term space missions outside the protection of the Earth’s geomagnetic sphere.
The health risks from galactic cosmic ray (GCR) exposure to astronauts include cancer1, central nervous system 
effects2, 3, cataracts4, 5, circulatory diseases3, 6, 7 and acute radiation syndromes5. Cancer and cataracts are the main 
concern for space missions in low Earth orbit8, while for long-term space missions outside the protection of the 
Earth’s magnetic field cancer risks are predicted to exceed acceptable risk levels9, and non-cancer risks are of 
concern1–3, 6, 7 for the higher organ doses of long-term space missions compared to missions in low Earth orbit. 
Annual GCR organ absorbed doses and dose equivalents vary over the solar cycle between 0.1 and 0.2 Gy/y and 
0.3 and 0.6 Sv/yr, respectively for average spacecraft shielding thicknesses1, 8, 9. Protons dominate absorbed doses, 
while heavy ions, low energy protons and helium particles, and neutrons make important contributions to dose 
equivalent because of their large quality factors. The high energies of GCR limit practical shielding amounts from 
providing significant attenuation9. The exploration of Mars will require missions of 900 days or longer with more 
than one year in deep space where exposures to all energies of GCR are unavoidable and doses only modestly 
decreased by radiation shielding.
There are several uncertainties in estimating space radiation cancer risks, including radiation quality and 
dose-rate effects, the transfer of epidemiology data between populations, and statistical and bias errors in epide-
miology data. Of these uncertainties, estimating radiation quality effects due to the lack of human data for the 
heavy ions and other high LET radiations that occur in space, is the largest uncertainty9, 10. Both quantitative and 
qualitative differences between high and low LET cancer risks are possible with the later suggesting inadequacies 
in the use of relative biological effectiveness (RBE) factors as a basis for risk estimates. Experimental studies of 
tumor induction in mice and surrogate cancer risk endpoints in cell culture models are used to estimate radiation 
quality factors and their uncertainties1. In studies of tumor induction with heavy ions, Harderian gland tumors in 
female B6CF1 mice has been the only study that has used a sufficient number of particle types (>4) and low doses 
(<0.2 Gy) to make a detailed study of radiation quality effects11–14.
Energy deposition by particles in biomolecules, cells, and tissues depends on several physical aspects of parti-
cle tracks including a core of very high energy deposition events near the particles path, and a so-called penumbra

of energetic electrons denoted as δ
-rays liberated in ionization by primary particles and electrons, which may 
extend for 100’s of microns from the particles path9. Other considerations are the varying ranges or cells traversed 
in tissue of particles of similar linear energy (LET) but different charge number or kinetic energy, and the effects 
of projectile and target fragmentation caused by nuclear interactions9. Both theoretical analysis and experimental 
studies suggest that biological effectiveness is dependent on particle energy and charge number and not LET 
alone due to the above noted physical characteristics.
Non-targeted effects (NTEs) include bystander effects where cells traversed by heavy ions transmit oncogenic 
signals to nearby cells, and genomic instability in the progeny of irradiated cells15–17. Analysis of the Harderian 
gland studies9, 14, 18 and experiments for chromosomal aberrations at low dose19, 20 suggests a model based on 
NTEs is favored over a targeted effects (TE) model, where the later assumes a linear dose response model con-
sistent with DNA damage and misrepair assumptions, while the former suggests a supra-linear dose response 
occurs which increases the risk at low doses compared to the TE model. The NTE model is supported by many 
mechanistic studies15–17 using micro-beams to direct radiation to targeted cells, medium transfer from irradiated 
to unirradiated cells, and inhibitors of reactive oxygen species, gap junctions and signaling pathways. The totality 
of these studies provide important evidence for NTEs, which should be prioritized in light of the scarcity of both 
human epidemiology and animal carcinogenesis studies for high LET radiation at the low doses and dose-rates 
that occur in space.
In this paper we considered a track structure model of tumor prevalence (TP) with TE and NTE assumptions, 
which is used to describe the Harderian gland experiment and extrapolate the results to make predictions for low 
dose and dose-rate GCR exposures. Results are compared to a recently published study using a LET dependent 
model fit to the same data14, and then applied to predictions of GCR exposures. In the remainder of this paper, we 
first discuss a Hazard function for TP using a track structure model consistent with either TE and NTE models. 
In the results section we first compare the model to experimental data for protons and heavy ions. We then use 
models of space radiation environments and radiation transport to compare the track structure model to the LET 
dependent model for nominal spacecraft shielding, and of the TE to NTE predictions.
Methods
Hazard Function for Tumor Prevalence. 
Tumor prevalence (TP) is described by a Hazard function, H, 
which is dependent on radiation type for γ
-rays or particles with charge number Z and kinetic energy per atomic 
mass unit (u), E and fluence, F21:

In experiments11–14 the HG tumor prevalence was expressed as the number of animals with tumor(s) divided 
by the total number of animals in the experimental group. In these publications, although there are two HG per 
mouse, one near each eye, however the number of animals with HG tumors was used as the numerator for the 
prevalence calculation.
Time-dependent factors in the Hazard function were described previously21, 22, however are suppressed herein 
because the experiments considered are restricted to tumor prevalence at an age of 600 d (irradiated 120 d old 
mice and held 16 for months = 120+480 = 600 d). For γ

The diameter of the epithelial cell nucleus believed to be transformed into mouse HG tumors is 5.5 µm11–14, 
which corresponds to a cross-sectional cell nucleus area, Anuc of about 24 µm2.
For particles, we considered a track structure model that extrapolates to low doses (or low fluence) to the func-
tional form used in the NASA cancer risk assessment model1, 20, which is consistent with a TE model that assumed 
a linear dose response at low doses. We also considered a NTE model, which assumed a non-linear type response 
in addition to the linear dose term at low doses. We used these models to make a global fit to the data12–14. The

In Equation (7) NBys is evaluated in a manner similar to Equation (4), however using an area, ABys, corresponding 
the number of bystander cells surrounding a cell traversed directly from a HZE particle that receive an onco-
genic signal. The second factor on the right hand side of Equation (7) describes the “turning on” of NTE at very 
low doses, which is estimated at about 1 mGy from alpha-particle experiments24–26. The HG experiments do not 
provide data to determine at which dose or fluence level this occurs, and if it depends on radiation quality or the 
temporal patterns of irradiation.
Following the parametric track structure model described in prior reports1, 20 we write an effective 
pseudo-biological action cross section for TE per particle as:

where Z* is the effective charge number of the particle, and vc is the particle velocity relative to the velocity of light. 
The constant α

form of Equation (8) is similar to the Katz cellular track structure model27, however assuming an initial linear 
dose component for γ
-rays for m > 1.
In Equations (5) and (6), we considered several approaches to model the radiation quality dependence of 
the β
-term. First we considered fitting values for γ
-rays and low LET particles independently (H and He) while 
assuming β
 = 0 for higher LET particles. In a second approach we considered a simultaneous fit for γ
-rays, H and 
He particles. Lastly we considered a global fit to the value of β

Equation (9) allows the influence of the dose-squared term to smoothly diminish with increasing ionization 
density or LET similar to the result found in the track structure model which can be described using either 
multi-target, multi-hit, or α
-β
 models as described by Katz28. These different approaches led to modest changes in 
fits and we used Equation (9) in the results below.
Cell Survival Function. 
Dimajo et al.29 performed ex-vivo analysis of the dose response for cell survival in 
the Harderian gland after X–ray irradiation using male CBA/Cne mice. In their report, cell survival was well fit 
using the multi-target model with extrapolation number, mS, and radio-sensitivity parameter D0 using

However, because of the mouse strain differences and possible differences between male and female mice, we 
also considered allowing D0 and mS to be fit to the dose response data for tumor prevalence. We note an earlier 
estimate21 of these data found ms = 3 and D0 = 2.6 Gy.

RBE Estimates. 
At low dose or fluence, RBE was calculated using the TE model, and is given by the ratio of 
linear induction coefficients. Here we used RBEγ
Acute, which compares low dose particle responses to acute γ
-ray 
exposures using a linear fit of acute γ
-ray responses doses near 1 Gy1, 10, with linear coefficient denoted as α
γ
. For 
the HG experiment the highest γ
- ray dose of 7 Gy is not included in the RBEγ
Acute estimate. This approach is used 
in the NASA quality factor (QF) model1 in order to be consistent with the linear response model used to repre-
sent the Atomic-bomb survivor solid cancer incidence data while reducing uncertainties related to low dose and 
dose-rate γ
-ray responses.
The functional form of the RBE function at low dose where cell survival effects can be ignored are based on 
the linear or targeted effects assumption (TE), which uses a linear fit to acute γ
-ray responses as the reference

We also considered RBE in the NTE model, however RBE estimates are dose dependent and do not limit to a 
constant value at low dose. Here it is convenient to define a cross-over dose where the contributions from the TE 
and NTE terms in the Hazard function of Equation (6) are equal:

Data Fitting. 
All statistical analysis and data fitting were done using STATA/SE version 14.1 (Stata Corp.). 
The value of TE or NTE model parameters are fitted across all particle beams using nonlinear least-squares data 
fitting weighted by the inverse of the variance. Tests of goodness of fit comparing the models described were made 
with the Akaike Information Criteria (AIC), Bayesian Information Criteria (BIC), and Adjusted R2 tests, which 
take into account differences in the number of parameters in the models considered. In the AIC and BIC tests, the 
model with the lowest test statistic provides the optimal fit, and in the Adjusted R2 test, the model with the highest 
values of the test statistic provides the optimal fit to the data.
GCR Exposures. 
GCR exposures include primary and secondary H, He and HZE particles, and secondary 
neutrons, mesons, electrons, and γ
-rays over a wide energy range. We used the HZE particle transport computer 
code (HZETRN) with quantum fragmentation model nuclear interaction cross sections30, 31 and Badhwar–O’Neill 
GCR environmental model to estimate particle energy spectra, ϕ
j(Z,E) as described previously1, 9. These methods 
agree with spaceflight data in low Earth orbit, in transit to Mars and on the Mars surface to within 15% for dose 
and dose equivalent9, 30, 32.
For GCR, which are low dose and dose-rate exposures, the contributions of cell survival and the β
 term for 
tumor induction are assumed to be negligible, and the Hazard function reduces to the linear induction and NTE 
terms. We considered 1-year GCR exposures; however ignore possible protraction effects that could occur in a 
mouse, which is outside the scope of this paper. The main assumption we make is that the exposures are low dose 
and dose-rate which would be true for the annual GCR environment (~0.2 Gy/y) delivered over time periods of 
a few days or longer times.
For the TE model, a mixed-field pseudo-action cross section is formed by weighting the particle spectra, ϕ
j(E) 
for particle species, j, contributing to GCR exposure evaluated with the HZETRN code with the pseudo-biological 
action cross section for mono-energetic particles and summing:

For the LET dependent model a similar expression is obtained using the functions described previously14.
For estimates of NTEs to GCR exposures Equation (15) is modified to include the last term in Equation (6), 
with the low fluence correction of Equation (7) playing an important role in predictions. Here we assume: (1) The 
probability that a bystander cell receives an oncogenic signal only occurs if the fluence is sufficiently high such 
that a nearby cell is traversed. (2) The time dependence of the bystander signals is a few days or less such that 
interactions of bystander signals from different HZE particles can be ignored. (3) The probability that a bystander 
cell is transformed by a direct hit at a different time is small and can be ignored. The effective mixed-field 
pseudo-action cross section in the NTE model then becomes

Because NBys, the maximum area limiting bystander effects for particle j, has not been estimated in the 
Harderian gland experiments, we used estimates based on cell culture experiments24–26 of 4x, 10x, and 20x the 
cross-sectional area of the target cell nucleus in our results.
Results
In Equation (8) the parameter m is the slope power describing the rise of the biological action cross section with 
increasing ionization density. Supplementary Table S1 shows results of fit for values of the parameter, m, of 2, 3, 
or 4, or fit with m as a free parameter. These results show the value m = 3 provided the best fit based on several 
statistical tests (Adjusted R2, AIC and BIC) and was then used in subsequent analysis, which indicates large values 
of biological effectiveness will occur for heavy ions and other high LET radiation types. Table 1 shows values of 
fitted parameters in the TE and NTE models described in the Methods section. The linear dose response terms 
for the particle data were similar in the models considered, however the NTE provided the optimal fits based on 
the AIC, BIC, and Adjusted R2 tests, which are statistical tests that account for the differences in the number of 
parameters used in the comparison of models (TE vs. NTE).
Figure 1 shows results for tumor prevalence versus absorbed dose for the Ne (670 MeV/u), Si (260 MeV/u), Ti 
(1000 MeV/u), Fe (600 MeV/u), Fe (540 MeV/u), Fe (350 MeV/u), Nb (580 MeV/u) and La (593 MeV/u) beams, 
and the global fits in the TE and NTE models to these data. Fits to each beam individually slightly improve the 
results; however global fits are advantageous to consider for applications in GCR risk assessments. The results of 
Fig. 1 show that as LET increased the NTE predicts much larger TP at the lower doses (<0.1 Gy) compared to 
the TE model. In Fig. 2 the TE and NTE track structure dose response models for proton and helium beams are 
compared to the experimental data of Alpen et al.12. For these low LET particles the models fit well, while results 
for the TE and NTE models are nearly identical, suggesting NTE play a negligible role for low LET particles. The

experiments for helium clearly show the reduction in TP at the highest doses, which is assumed to be due to cell 
killing in our model.
Figure 3 shows the combined data from various experiments12–14 for tumor prevalence versus the fluence of 
particles in the NTE model. Excellent agreement is found between the NTE model and the experiments. These 
results indicate that exposure to much less than one particle per cell nuclei in the Harderian gland increases 
TP by several-fold above the background TP for 56Fe and other heavy ions. Table 2 provides our predictions of 
dose-dependent RBEs in the NTE model with values at 0.1 and 0.01 Gy and the limiting value at higher dose 
shown. The RBE for heavy ions is predicted to increase as dose is decreased as described by Equation (14). This is 
due to the weak or non-existent NTE expected for γ
-rays such that the nearly dose-independent NTE for heavy 
ions is being compared to a diminishing effectiveness for γ
-rays at lowe doses. At higher doses the RBE decreases 
and TE’s dominate the heavy ion response. The RBE estimates in Table 2 are consistent with those found for other 
high-LET radiations, including 56Fe particles and fission neutrons, however the present results are unique in that 
the RBE’s for a wide range of particles are described that span the types of particles found in space. RBE estimates 
in the NTE model greatly exceed those of the TE model reaching a value of 50 relative to acute γ
-ray exposures at 
0.001 Gy for the most effective particle type studied.
Using the fits based on the TE models, Fig. 4 show the RBEγ
Acute in the track structure model and LET model 
versus kinetic energy with Fig. 4A (proton and 4He) and Fig. 4B (16O, 28Si, and 56Fe). We note that the results 
of Fig. 4 used model parameters fit with the TE models, which leads to different RBE predictions compared to 
parameters derived from fits of the NTE model at higher doses in Table 2 where the first term in Equation (6) 
dominates. Clearly there are large differences that occur in the two approaches to extrapolate a limited number of 
experimental observations to the diversity of particles that appear in the GCR. Figure 4C compares predictions 
for different shielding amounts for the track structure and LET dependent TE models. The LET dependent model 
provides a higher TP prediction compared to the track structure dependent model at shallow to intermediate 
shielding depths (<20 g/cm2), while the track structure model shows higher TP at large shielding depths (>20 g/
cm2).
The number of cells at risk include cells directly traversed by ions and bystander cells. Cells not directly 
traversed by GCR particles also receive small absorbed doses from δ
-rays (<10 mGy) and the question arises on 
the importance of their contribution to tumor induction. In an earlier report a method to estimate the number 
of cells receiving δ
-ray tracks alone above a dose threshold was formulated using radial dose models of energy 
deposition by ions23. In Fig. 4D predictions of potential number of cells per year susceptible to TE and NTE for 
annual GCR exposures at solar minimum assuming 20 g/cm2 aluminum shielding and 5 cm tissue depth are 
shown assuming ABys = 20 Acell. The mean number of cells hits per year by δ
-rays with an absorbed dose >0.1 mGy 
are also shown for different GCR charge groups. The results of Fig. 4D show that cells potentially transformed by 
either TE or NTE from heavy ions are unlikely to be traversed by more than one heavy ion on an annual basis, 
which is an assumption made by the model of Equation (16). More frequent traversals by low LET protons and 
helium ions are predicted; however the probability of NTE transformation by these particles is small as shown 
by Fig. 2. Low energy protons and helium ions are high LET irradiation and will have large TE and NTE proba-
bilities as predicted by Equations (8) and (7), respectively, however make-up only a small percentage (<10%) of 
the mean number of proton and helium hits in Fig. 4D. The number of cells traversed by δ
-rays alone is similar to 
the number of NTE potential cells for heavy ions, while the number of NTE potential cells is much larger for low 
charge number, Z ions. However the biological effects of δ
-rays will be similar to that of γ
-rays. Using the γ
-ray 
dose response data for Harderian gland tumors11–14 suggests the low absorbed doses to cells traversed by δ
-rays 
leads to a small carcinogenic risk. The probability of NTE tumor induction estimated by fits to the Harderian 
gland experiments using Equation (7) is considered next.
In Fig. 5 we show the main result of this paper where %-TP for the TE and NTE models is compared. For the 
NTE model, predictions using different assumptions for the effective cross-sectional area for bystander cells that

dominate GCR cancer risks and thus represent the large uncertainty associated with determining low dose 
(<0.1 Gy) responses from HZE particles and other high LET radiation. The implications of this finding is further 
demonstrated in Table 3 which compares the resulting effective RBE estimates for GCR behind a typical space-
craft average shielding of 20 g/cm2 of aluminum to measurements of the GCR average quality factor (QF) from 
the Mars Science Laboratories transit from Earth to Mars33. Here the QF estimate is based on the LET dependent

model of radiation quality8. The predictions of the NTE model suggest that a 2-fold enhancement in cancer risk 
would occur compared to the TE model predictions with further differences using LET as a descriptor compared 
to one based on descriptors of particle track structure.
Discussion
The NTE model is shown to predict a 2-fold or higher cancer risk compared to a TE model for chronic GCR expo-
sures with predictions highly dependent on the number of bystander cells susceptible to oncogenic signals from 
cells directly traversed by heavy ions. The Harderian gland tumor induction studies11–13 has remained the most 
comprehensive data available to study the dose responses for a significant number of heavy ion types, including 
the recent studies with 28Si and 48Ti particles14. Nevertheless significant differences in the dose response and rel-
ative biological effectiveness factors (RBEs) have been reported between mouse studies for the Harderian gland 
with tissues that dominate human radiation cancer risk, including acute myeloid leukemia34, 35, hepatocellular 
carcinoma34, 35, mammary36 and colorectal tumors37. Older studies with fission neutrons show similar variations 
in RBEs for a wide-range of solid tumors38–41. These differences could limit the applicability of the predictions 
described in this paper based on the Harderian gland model. However both the National Council on Radiation

Protection and Measurements (NCRP)42 and the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP)43 
have noted the Harderian gland experiments provide important information on radiation quality effects related 
to cancer risks. In addition, no other comprehensive data sets on low-dose cancer risks for HZE particles has been 
published, while studies with surrogate cancer endpoints in cell culture models are also sparse at the low doses 
appropriate to GCR exposure where the annual HZE particle dose in tissue is ~0.05 Gy/y near solar minimum, 
and less at other times in the solar cycle1, 9, 31.
Important evidence in support of NTEs as contributing to both cancer initiation and promotion is suggested 
by a large number of both in-vitro and in-vivo mechanistic studies15–17, 44–46, and studies with broad-beam irradi-
ation such as alpha-particles25, 26 or HZE particles19, 20. The main limitation of the current NTE model predictions 
is the lack of an additional tumor type to understand the possible generality of our results. The Harderian gland 
tumor model enjoys a low background incidence of tumors, especially for the endpoint of TP at 600 days (~3%), 
which allows for low doses to be considered in experiments with a modest number of animals for each dose and 
particle type group. Other HZE particle tumor studies34–37 typically have higher background incidences (>10%) 
and have employed at most a single low dose (defined as doses where less than one particle traverses the target cell 
nucleus (~0.1 Gy)), while several low doses would be needed to understand the shape of the dose response and 
the relative contributions from TE and NTEs.
The effect of dose-rate in the present approach for low LET radiation follows from Equations (2) and (6) 
whereby for low dose-rate estimates the β
-term is ignored. The values of α
 and β
 found for the Harderian gland 
experiment suggest a dose- and dose-rate reduction effectiveness factor (DDREF) of about 2.2 as described pre-
viously10. Grahn et al.38 performed chronic low dose-rate γ
-ray exposures in B6CF1 male and female mice for 
90 and 180-d duration, which were compared to acute γ
-ray exposures. DDREF estimates for a variety of tumor 
types varied from about 1.7 to more than 5 in these experiments with an average value of about 2.7 found for the 
90 day exposures10. Estimates of DDREF’s from the Atomic-bomb survivor cancer risk studies were about 1.3 
in the BEIR VII report. However, Hoel47 suggests a DDREF between 2 and 3 using an improved analysis, which 
avoids the dose truncation model used by the BEIR VII committee48 and includes a cell sterilization term, which 
introduces downward curvature at higher doses. Thus the present results are similar to results of the Grahn et al.38 
experiments and the analysis of Hoel47. In our previous publication49 we suggested that the DDREF to be used 
for δ
-rays would be similar to that of γ
-rays. For high LET radiation dose-rate modifiers are expected to a smaller 
compared to low LET radiation. Studies that have compared single acute exposure to dose-fractionation over

several days with HZE particles have not reported important differences, especially at low dose13, 14, 35, 50, which 
suggests a DDREF near unity should be used for chronic high LET irradiation.
The major conclusion of this report is to recommend a priority be given to obtaining additional experimental 
data with a sufficient number of particle types with experiments performed with several low doses in the tissues 
predicted to dominate human radiation cancer risk, which are lung, stomach, liver, breast, and colon. Other 
studies are needed to understand the lethality of HZE particle and other high LET radiation induced tumors and 
possible reduced tumor latency compared to low LET and background tumors1, 10, 35, 38, 50.
