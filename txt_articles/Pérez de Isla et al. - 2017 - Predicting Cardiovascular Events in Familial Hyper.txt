ORIGINAL RESEARCH ARTICLE
BACKGROUND: Although risk factors for atherosclerotic cardiovascular 
disease (ASCVD) in familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) have been described, 
models for predicting incident ASCVD have not been reported. Our aim 
was to use the SAFEHEART registry (Spanish Familial Hypercholesterolemia 
Cohort Study) to define key risk factors for predicting incident ASCVD in 
patients with FH.
METHODS: SAFEHEART is a multicenter, nationwide, long-term 
prospective cohort study of a molecularly defined population with FH with 
or without previous ASCVD. Analyses to define risk factors and to build a 
risk prediction equation were developed, and the risk prediction equation 
was tested for its ability to discriminate patients who experience incident 
ASCVD from those who did not over time.
RESULTS: We recruited 2404 adult patients with FH who were followed 
up for a mean of 5.5 years (SD, 3.2 years), during which 12 (0.5%) and 
122 (5.1%) suffered fatal and nonfatal incident ASCVD, respectively. 
Age, male sex, history of previous ASCVD, high blood pressure, 
increased body mass index, active smoking, and low-density lipoprotein 
cholesterol and lipoprotein(a) levels were independent predictors of 
incident ASCVD from which a risk equation with a Harrell C index of 0.85 
was derived. The bootstrap resampling (100 randomized samples) of 
the original set for internal validation showed a degree of overoptimism 
of 0.003. Individual risk was estimated for each person without an 
established diagnosis of ASCVD before enrollment in the registry by use 
of the SAFEHEART risk equation, the modified Framingham risk equation, 
and the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association 
ASCVD Pooled Cohort Risk Equations. The Harrell C index for these 
models was 0.81, 0.78, and 0.8, respectively, and differences between 
the SAFEHEART risk equation and the other 2 were significant (P=0.023 
and P=0.045).
CONCLUSIONS: The risk of incident ASCVD may be estimated in patients 
with FH with simple clinical predictors. This finding may improve risk 
stratification and could be used to guide therapy in patients with FH.

H
eterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is 
the most common genetic disorder associated with 
premature atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease 
(ASCVD).1 Recent data suggest that the prevalence of FH 
may be as high as 0.4%.2,3 Patients with FH have a 3- to 
13-fold greater risk of premature ASCVD compared with 
individuals without FH.2,4–6 Sudden death and acute isch-
emic heart disease are the main causes of death among 
these subjects.7,8 Early diagnosis and lowering of low-
density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) significantly reduce 
ASCVD and improve quality of life in people with FH.9
Risk of cardiovascular disease in FH can be highly 
variable, however. It is therefore incumbent on physi-
cians caring for patients with FH to develop tools for 
predicting those at greatest risk of developing incident 
ASCVD to apportion the best use of resources, including 
new therapies that potently lower LDL-C.10,11 Although 
the risk factors for incident ASCVD in FH have been well 
described, the findings have been based on small co-
horts of patients attending specialist clinics, and recom-
mendations on risk assessment have been qualitative 
and derived from expert opinion.12,13 No accurate risk 
prediction models for predicting incident ASCVD in pa-
tients with FH have been described, chiefly because of 
lack of reliable, longitudinal data from registry cohorts. 
The SAFEHEART registry (Spanish Familial Hypercholes-
terolemia Cohort Study) provides a unique opportunity to 
address this need.
Our aim was to use the prospective SAFEHEART reg-
istry to determine the predictors of incident ASCVD in 
patients with FH with or without previous ASCVD.
METHODS
Study Design and Population
SAFEHEART is a multicenter, nationwide, long-term, prospec-
tive cohort study in a molecularly defined heterozygous popu-
lation of patients with FH in Spain with and without previous 
ASCVD.14 Data analyzed for this work were obtained between 
January 2004 and October 2015, and only subjects ≥18 years 
old were included. This study was approved by the local eth-
ics committees, and all eligible subjects gave written informed 
consent. This article has been written following the TRIPOD 
(Transparent Reporting of a Multivariable Prediction Model for 
Individual Prognosis or Diagnosis) requirements.15 Treatment 
goals for the management of these patients were based on 
consecutively released international recommendations.2,16 
The Coordinating Center was responsible for managing the 
follow-up.14 Patients were contacted annually by telephone by 
trained staff using a standardized phone call protocol from the 
Coordinating Center.
Clinical Measurements
Demographic and clinical characteristics were recorded as 
described elsewhere.14 Venous blood samples were taken after 
a 12-hour fast. Plasma lipid profile and lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] 
levels were determined as previously described.17 Because 
many patients were on lipid-lowering therapy (LLT) at inclusion, 
pretreatment LDL-C levels were estimated according to previ-
ous recommendations.18 Hypertension was defined as systolic 
blood pressure >140 mm 
Hg and/or diastolic blood pressure 
>90 mm 
Hg on 2 measurements on 2 different days or need 
of antihypertensive drugs. DNA was isolated from whole blood, 
and the genetic diagnosis of FH was made.19 Mutations were 
classified as receptor negative or receptor defective, depend-
ing on their functional class. Mutations without a functional 
class in the literature were classified as unclassified muta-
tions.20 The potency of LLT was calculated as reported else-
where with a modification to include the effect of ezetimibe.21,22 
Ezetimibe was considered to decrease LDL-C by 15%, and this 
effect was added to the statin effect when appropriate.22 LDL-C 
life-years were calculated as previously described.2
Definition of Previous ASCVD
Previous ASCVD was defined as the presence before enroll-
ment of any of the following: (1) myocardial infarction, proved 
by at least 2 of the following: classic symptoms, specific ECG 
changes, and increased levels of cardiac biomarkers; (2) 
angina pectoris, diagnosed as classic symptoms in combina-
tion with at least 1 unequivocal result of one of the following: 
Clinical Perspective
What Is New?
• Risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease is 
variable among patients with familial hypercholes-
terolemia (FH).
• Models for predicting incident atherosclerotic car-
diovascular disease in FH have not been reported, 
and prospective cohort data in patients with well-
defined FH are rare.
• The SAFEHEART registry (Spanish Familial Hyper-
cholesterolemia Cohort Study) is a nationwide, 
long-term, prospective contemporary cohort of a 
molecularly defined FH population.
• A robust risk prediction equation has been devel-
oped in this unique cohort that shows that the risk of 
incident atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease may 
be estimated in patients with FH using clinical and 
laboratory parameters, including age, sex, history 
of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, blood 
pressure, body mass index, smoking, and plasma 
low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and lipoprotein(a) 
levels.
What Are the Clinical Implications?
• This information will allow more accurate athero-
sclerotic cardiovascular disease risk prediction in 
FH and will potentially increase the efficiency of care 
and use of newer lipid-lowering therapies.
• The SAFEHEART risk equation is a simple, accurate, 
and widely applicable tool for use in primary and 
specialist care settings.

percutaneous coronary intervention or other invasive coronary 
procedures as indicated by the treating physician; (4) coronary 
artery bypass grafting; (5) ischemic stroke demonstrated by 
computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging scan 
or documented transient ischemic attack; (6) peripheral artery

toms and at least 1 positive result of an ankle/arm index<0.9, 
stenosis>50% on angiography or ultrasonography, or abdomi-
nal aortic aneurysm; or (7) peripheral arterial revascularization, 
that is, peripheral artery bypass grafting or percutaneous trans-
luminal angioplasty. Premature familial ASCVD was defined as 
the occurrence of the first event before 55 years of age in 
men and before 65 years of age in women in the patient’s rela-
tives. Cardiovascular risk factors were defined according the 
European Society of Cardiology recommendations.23 Maximum 
statin dose, maximum combined therapy, and maximum LLT 
were defined as previously reported.24
Definition of Incident ASCVD
Incident ASCVD during follow-up was defined as the occurrence 
after enrollment of the first one of the following: fatal or non-
fatal myocardial infarction, fatal or nonfatal ischemic stroke, 
coronary revascularization, peripheral artery revascularization, 
or cardiovascular death (any death related to cardiovascular 
disease or derived of cardiovascular therapeutic procedures 
not described in the previous definitions).
Statistical Analysis
Statistical analyses were carried out with Stata version 13.0 
(StataCorp LP, College Station, TX). Variables were ana-
lyzed for normal distribution with the Kolmogorov-Smirnov 
test. Quantitative data were expressed as mean and stan-
dard deviation or median and interquartile range (IQR) and 
qualitative data as absolute number and percentage. Two 
populations were defined: population at entry (n=2746) and 
population at follow-up (otherwise known as the cohort), which 
included patients who had a full plasma lipid profile at follow-
up (n=2404) and was the population used for the analysis. 
Associations between qualitative variables were analyzed by 
the χ2 test. Associations between quantitative variables were 
analyzed by the paired Student t test. Univariate effects were 
analyzed by means of hazard ratios and their 95% confidence 
intervals with a clustered Cox model in which the cluster was 
the family (a family for each index case).25 A clustered Cox 
model was adjusted by introducing those variables with a value 
of P<0.05 and confounding variables, and a risk equation was 
derived (SAFEHEART-RE). Patient data at enrollment were used 
for the analysis. To simplify the use of the equation and to 
introduce the variables in the model in a more parsimonious 
way, continuous variables were transformed into categorical 
variables. Cut points for LDL-C and Lp(a) were selected on the 
basis of currently used levels to establish clinical decisions. 
Cut points for body mass index were selected according the 
definition of overweight and obesity. In the case of age, the 
cut points correspond to the inferior and superior quintiles 
of the age distribution in the analyzed population. We evalu-
ated the ability of the risk prediction model to discriminate 
individuals who experienced incident ASCVD from those who 
did not using an overall C statistic,26,27 extending a previous 
suggestion by Harrell et al.28 This C statistic is analogous to 
the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve. The 
performance of the model was also evaluated with respect to 
their discrimination and calibration ability on the basis of the 
Hosmer-Lemeshow type χ2 statistic. For internal validation of 
the model, the degree of overoptimism resulting from model 
assessment on the same data on which it was developed was 
estimated with bootstrap resampling of the original set (100 
randomized samples) as recommended by TRIPOD.15 To esti-
mate the probability of an event, we used the Kaplan-Meier 
estimator to obtain the 5-year and 10-year risk according the 
method described by D’Agostino et al.29,30 Risk estimation 
based on the Framingham equation and American College of 
Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) ASCVD 
Pooled Cohort Risk Equations31 was carried out for each indi-
vidual without previous ASCVD, and Harrell C indexes were 
obtained. Interequation risk agreement was evaluated by the 
intraclass correlation coefficient by use of the rate obtained 
for each individual according the different scores. To compare 
Harrell C indexes in patients without previous ASCVD (patients 
with ASCVD before enrollment were excluded for this analysis), 
the method described by Newson32 was used. Two-tailed tests 
were used, and a value of P<0.05 was considered significant.
RESULTS
A total of 4141 subjects were recruited. Of them, 787 
patients were index cases (19.0%). Of the total popula-
tion, 3749 were ≥18 years of age, of whom 2746 were 
FH cases, and 2404 subjects were followed up and 
had a full plasma lipid profile (Figure 1). This was the 
population analyzed. One thousand five hundred patients

maximum combined therapy, patients on maximum LLT, 
years on statins, years on ezetimibe, LDL-C–years, and 
LLT potency.
Molecular Diagnosis
Two hundred nine different functional mutations in the 
LDLR (97.0%) and APOB (3.0%) genes were identified. 
In the cohort, 856 patients (35.6%) had LDLR-null muta-
tions, 1092 (45.4%) had defective mutations, and 384 
(16.0%) had unclassified mutations.
LLT, LDL-C Plasma Levels, and Attainment of 
LDL-C Goals at Inclusion and Follow-Up
At entry, 2025 patients (84.2%) with FH were receiving 
LLT. Of them, 943 patients with FH (39.2%) were receiv-
ing maximum statin dose, and this increased to 1326 
(55.2%) at follow-up. The use of ezetimibe, maximum 
combined therapy, and maximum LLT increased at follow-
up from 902 (37.5%) to 1419 (59.0%), from 547 (22.8%) 
to 973 (40.5%), and from 1248 (51.9%) to 1728 (71.9%), 
respectively. Plasma LDL-C concentration decreased by 
19.1%, reaching a mean value 143.9 mg/dL (SD 45.0 
mg/dL) at follow-up (Table 2). LDL-C goals (LDL-C <70 
mg/dL for patients with previous ASCVD and <100 mg/
dL for patients without) were reached by 79 patients 
(3.3%) at inclusion and 195 (8.1%) during follow-up. 
LDL-C level <100 mg/dL was reached by 110 subjects 
(4.6%) at enrollment and by 252 (10.5%) at follow-up.
Predictors of Incident ASCVD
At entry, 307 patients (12.8%) in the cohort had an es-
tablished diagnosis of ASCVD before enrollment. Non-
fatal incident ASCVD occurred in 122 subjects (5.1%; 
62 nonfatal myocardial infarctions, 42 coronary artery 
revascularization procedures, 13 nonfatal strokes, and 
5 peripheral artery revascularizations) during follow-up; 
among them, 64 patients (52.5%) had an established 
diagnosis of ASCVD before enrollment. Fatal incident 
ASCVD occurred in 12 patients (0.5%; 3 fatal acute myo-
cardial infarctions, 2 fatal strokes, and 7 cardiovascular 
deaths). Ten of these 12 patients had nonfatal incident 
ASCVD (3 fatal acute myocardial infarctions, 2 fatal 
strokes, and 5 cardiovascular deaths, all of them after 
enrollment). Only the first event during follow-up was con-
sidered for analysis.
Table 3 shows univariate and multivariate predictors 
of incident ASCVD in the study cohort. Age, male sex, 
history of ASCVD before enrollment, high blood pres-
sure, increased body mass index, active smoking, and 
LDL-C and Lp(a) levels were independent predictors of 
incident ASCVD development during follow-up. It is of 
note that the Harrell C index for this model was 0.85. 
The Hosmer-Lemeshow χ2(8) was 1.64; probability>χ2 
= 0.99. With the use of continuous rather than cate-
gorical variables for age, body mass index and LDL-C 
yielded similar discrimination (Harrell C index=0.85). 
Figure I in the online-only Data Supplement presents the 
expected and observed distribution of the number of 
events in the cohort calibrated by deciles. From these 
findings, the incident ASCVD risk for an individual with 
FH can be estimated by using the SAFEHEART-RE (ex-
amples in Table 3). Thus, the 5-year risk can be calcu-
lated as 1−0.9532exp(ΣβX−5.4078), where β is the regres-
sion coefficient and X is the level for each risk factor; 
the 10-year risk is given as 1−0.9025exp(ΣβX−5.4078). The 
5-year median risk of the population was 3.59% (IQR, 
1.94%–10.63%), and 10-year median risk was 7.53% 
(IQR,4.11%–21.39%). Figures 2 and 3 show examples 
of the 5- and 10-year estimated cardiovascular risk pro-
vided by the SAFEHEART-RE.
Internal Validation
The bootstrap resampling of the original set (100 ran-
domized samples) showed a degree of overoptimism of 
0.003, which represents the deviation from the mean 
of the standard error of the estimation in these 100 
samples.
Framingham Risk Equation and ACC/AHA ASCVD 
Pooled Cohort Risk Equations Compared With 
SAFEHEART-RE in Patients Without Previous 
ASCVD
The SAFEHEART-RE Harrell C index for patients without 
an established diagnosis of ASCVD before enrollment 
in the registry was 0.81. Individual risk was estimated 
for each person without an established diagnosis of 
ASCVD before enrollment in the registry by use of the 
modified Framingham risk equation. The 10-year esti-
mated median risk of the enrolled population was 7.17% 
(IQR, 2.93%–14.48%) with the use of the Framingham

ASCVD indicates atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease; HDL-C, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol; and LDL-C, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol.
The following examples illustrate the application of the formulas to estimate the 5-year and 10-year risk of developing incident ASCVD. Risks are 
expressed as percentages.
Case 1: a 20-year-old woman with normal blood pressure and no previous ASCVD, who is not a current smoker, and who has a normal body mass index, 
LDL-C of 90 mg/dL, and lipoprotein(a) of 33 mg/dL. The risk estimate based on the model is computed as follows:
5-year risk = 1−0.9532exp[(0.70×0+1.07×0+1.45×0+0.69×0+1.42×0+0.48×0+0.88×0+0.98×0+0.92×0+1.57×0+0.42×0)−5.4078]=0.0002148≈0.02%
10-year risk = 1−0.9025exp[(0.70×0+1.07×0+1.45×0+0.69×0+1.42×0+0.48×0+0.88×0+0.98×0+0.92×0+1.57×0+0.42×0)– 5.4078]=0.0004598≈0.05%
Case 2: a 63-year-old man who is hypertensive, has previous myocardial infarction, is a current smoker, is obese, and has an LDL-C of 182 mg/dL and 
lipoprotein(a) of 64 mg/dL. The risk estimate based on the model is computed as follows:
5-year risk=1−0.9532exp[(0.70×1+1.07×0+1.45×1+0.69×1+1.42×1+0.48×1+0.88×0+0.98×1+0.92×0+1.57×1+0.42×1)–5.4078]=0.3808≈38.1%
10-year risk=1−0.9025exp[(0.70×1+1.07×0+1.45×1+0.69×1+1.42×1+0.48×1+0.88×0+0.98×1+0.92×0+1.57×1+0.42×1)–5.4078]=0.6415≈64.15%
The numbers 0.9532 and 0.9025 are the 5- and 10-year baseline cumulative probabilities of suffering an incident ASCVD. They are obtained from the 
Kaplan-Meier curves.

for this model was 0.80. SAFEHEART-RE versus ACC/

risk intraclass correlation coefficient was 0.13 (95% 
confidence interval, 0.09–0.17). The Harrell C indexes 
were significantly different between the 2 methods of

DISCUSSION
This study identifies increased age, male sex, history 
of ASCVD, high blood pressure, increased body mass 
index, active smoking, and LDL-C and Lp(a) levels as in-
dependent prospective predictors of increased risk of 
incident ASCVD in patients with FH, which were subse-
quently used to develop the SAFEHEART-RE. To the best 
of our knowledge, this is the first report of an equation to 
predict cardiovascular events in patients with FH. These 
results are simple, highly accurate, and widely applicable 
in primary and specialist care settings.
Unlike the general population for which robust risk pre-
diction models are available, risk stratification in patients 
with FH has been based mostly on retrospective and 
cross-sectional observations.13 The prospective SAFE-
HEART study, which enrolled only patients with molecu-
larly proven FH undergoing contemporary LLT, allowed 
for the first time the development of a new prospective 
model for predicting incident ASCVD in FH. Even more, 
SAFEHEART-RE is a pragmatic approach to patients with 
FH because it reproduces real-life circumstances: The 
patient is initially evaluated by means of simple variables 
present in the first medical contact, and his/her progno-
sis is assessed, taking into account the LLT optimization 
that the patient will receive according to his/her clinical 
and biochemical characteristics during follow-up, similar 
to what occurred in the SAFEHEART registry.
LDL-C levels >309 mg/dL before therapy have 
been previously used to identify a more severe FH 
phenotype in a Dutch cohort.33 This definition is not 
based on prospective data, however. A more rigorous 
approach to defining incident ASCVD risk in patients 
with FH is provided by the present study, with implica-
tions for more rational use of diagnostic and screen-
ing services and, in particular, more cost-effective 
prescription of newer and expensive LDL-C–lowering 
treatments such as proprotein convertase subtilisin/
kexin type 9 inhibitors.1,13,34
Previous evidence identifying ASCVD risk factors in 
an FH population presenting a high rate of established 
cardiovascular disease has been published, although the 
study was cross-sectional, the sample size was relatively 
small, and molecular diagnosis was confirmed in only 
62% of cases. Therefore, this evidence has limited value 
compared with our prospective data.35 In the present 
study, we present a new equation that is able to prospec-

tively assess incident ASCVD risk over 5 and 10 years in 
patients with FH. Based on a limited number of variables, 
the equation estimates the likelihood of developing fatal 
or nonfatal incident ASCVD. Furthermore, the accuracy 
of the SAFEHEART-RE is high and significantly better 
than that offered by both the Framingham risk equation 
and the ACC/AHA ASCVD Pooled Cohort Risk Equations 
in those patients with FH without ASCVD at baseline. This 
model could afford clinical services for patients with FH 
an invaluable tool to evaluate incident ASCVD risk and 
consequently to establish a more cost-effective design 
of healthcare systems that could improve the quality of 
life36 and the life expectancy of patients. Nevertheless, 
the cutoff point to define high risk needs to be estab-
lished according to scientific, economic, and political cri-
teria, acknowledging that moderate statin therapy can 
reduce ASCVD mortality by 70%9 and that recent data 
suggest a 44% reduction in ASCVD events with statins 
with the possible addition of ezetimibe.37
The role that Lp(a) plays in the prediction of incident 
ASCVD in patients with FH is noteworthy. In the pres-
ent prospective analysis, we confirm our previous as-
sociation between high Lp(a) levels and cardiovascular 
disease in patients with FH.17 This mandates the value of 
routinely estimating Lp(a) concentrations in patients with 
FH, with possible implications for the use of new Lp(a)-
lowering therapies.1
It is noteworthy that some expected risk factors were 
not included in the final predictive model. The reason was 
that they did not enhance the accuracy of the equation 
in predicting incident ASCVD. Type, potency, and length 
of treatment against a background of LDL-C life-years 
are key aspects of the management of patients with FH. 
Statins and drugs that reduce cholesterol absorption 
have been widely used to treat FH.1,7,24 Usually, individu-
als with higher LDL-C levels need several medications to 
reduce LDL-C to targets recommended by expert guide-
lines.2,16 However, we found that type of treatment was 
not independently associated with the risk of incident 
ASCVD, implying that the level of LDL-C attained is more 
important than the type of drug used to treat FH. Fur-
thermore, the presence of diabetes mellitus was not a 
predictor of incident ASCVD risk, which may relate to the 
low prevalence and the low mean age of our FH cohort. 
This low prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus among 
patients with FH, significantly lower than among unaf-
fected relatives, has previously been reported.38 Type 
of LDLR mutation (null/defective) was also not selected 
as a risk predictor, implying that LDL-C concentrations 
are more important in predicting outcomes in FH than 
type of molecular defect, as has been previously sug-
gested.13 This reinforces the concept that phenotype is 
more important than genotype in managing patients with 
FH.13,39 Hence, a patient with a null mutation but low LDL-
C could have less risk than a patient with a defective 
mutation but high LDL-C level.
Strengths and Limitations
This is the largest longitudinal study of a molecularly 
characterized heterozygous FH population that reflects 
real-life clinical care of patients by both general practitio-
ners and specialists. These results emphasize the poten-
tial of a well-organized registry in assessing treatment 
monitoring and outcomes, as well as national trends in 
the care of FH. Nevertheless, there are some limitations. 
For instance, the study uniquely used national registry 
data, and children and adolescents were excluded from 
this analysis. Furthermore, a pretreatment lipid profile 
for every patient was lacking, but a recognized estima-
tion was provided. Although in this work the internal vali-
dation was carried out according the TRIPOD recommen-
dations,15 further studies and recalibration are needed 
to validate the SAFEHEART-RE in other FH populations. 
Nevertheless, in our population, there are >200 differ-
ent mutations, and most of these mutations are shared 
with many European and American countries, which 
underscores the generalizability of our risk-estimating 
equation. Unfortunately, at present, there is no patient 
cohort comparable to SAFEHEART in terms of number of 
patients enrolled, quality of the diagnosis, and duration 
of follow-up to externally validate our risk equation. Last, 
because our mean follow-up period was only 5.5 years, 
risk predictions made over 10 years should be viewed 
cautiously.
Conclusions
The risk of incident ASCVD may be estimated in patients 
with FH using simple clinical estimates, including age, 
sex, history of ASCVD, blood pressure, body mass in-
dex, smoking, and plasma LDL-C and Lp(a) levels. The 
SAFEHEART-RE is an accurate tool to implement these 
predictors in daily clinical practice. These findings may 
improve risk stratification and could be used to guide 
therapy in patients with HF and to assist with clinical 
research.
