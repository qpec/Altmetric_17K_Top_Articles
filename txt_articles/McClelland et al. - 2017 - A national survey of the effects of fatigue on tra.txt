Summary
Long daytime and overnight shifts remain a major feature of working life for trainees in anaesthesia. Over the past
10 years, there has been an increase in awareness and understanding of the potential effects of fatigue on both the
doctor and the patient. The Working Time Regulations (1998) implemented the European Working Time Directive
into UK law, and in August 2009 it was applied to junior doctors, reducing the maximum hours worked from an
average of 56 per week to 48. Despite this, there is evidence that problems with inadequate rest and fatigue persist.
There is no official guidance regarding provision of a minimum standard of rest facilities for doctors in the National
Health Service, and the way in which rest is achieved by trainee anaesthetists during their on-call shift depends on
rota staffing and workload. We conducted a national survey to assess the incidence and effects of fatigue among the
3772 anaesthetists in training within the UK. We achieved a response rate of 59% (2231/3772 responses), with data
from 100% of NHS trusts. Fatigue remains prevalent among junior anaesthetists, with reports that it has effects on
physical health (73.6% [95%CI 71.8–75.5]), psychological wellbeing (71.2% [69.2–73.1]) and personal relationships
(67.9% [65.9–70.0]). The most problematic factor remains night shift work, with many respondents commenting on
the absence of breaks, inadequate rest facilities and 57.0% (55.0–59.1) stating they had experienced an accident or
near-miss when travelling home from night shifts. We discuss potential explanations for the results, and present a
plan to address the issues raised by this survey, aiming to change the culture around fatigue for the better.

Introduction
The working patterns of doctors have changed signifi-
cantly since the European Working Time Directive
was introduced in 2009 [1]. Although recognition and
understanding of fatigue in the workplace has evolved
in recent years, the potentially devastating effects of
inadequate rest are still seen, suggesting that doctors
continue
to

 tiredness [2]. Much of our understanding of fatigue
derives from studies in aviation. A detailed definition
refers not only to airline crews, but can also be applied
to anaesthetists: “Fatigue is defined as a physiological
state of reduced mental or physical performance capa-
bility resulting from sleep loss or extended wakefulness,
circadian phase, or workload (mental and/or physical
activity) that can impair a crew member’s alertness and
ability to safely operate an aircraft or perform safety-
related duties” [3].
Work outside normal office hours forms a signifi-
cant portion of any trainee anaesthetist’s contracted
duties [4]. Weekday work in office hours may be just
as intense, but there are usually more doctors in the
hospital with whom to share tasks, and thus ensure
that rest breaks can be taken. The guidance relating to
doctors’ rest entitlements during a period of work are
laid out by the New Deal agreement for junior doctors,
and state that ‘natural breaks of thirty uninterrupted
minutes after every four hours worked should be
taken’ [5]. For those undertaking partial shifts and
out-of-hours work, actual rest breaks of the same
duration are required in addition to natural breaks.
These should also be uninterrupted, but can be taken
at any time and the New Deal guidance expects that
there will be appropriate cover at all times to support
this [5]. The 2016 Junior Doctor Contract stipulates
that breaks should be reduced to 30 minutes for every
5 hours worked, and another 30 minutes for a shift
lasting for more than 9 hours. A total of four long day
or night shifts of a maximum of 13 hours’ duration is
permitted within 1 week [6]. Failure to achieve these
breaks in their intended form may result in fatigue [7].
Fatigue and sleep deprivation result in deterioration of
cognitive and psychomotor skills [8]. Impairment of
cognitive function after approximately 18 hours with-
out sleep has been shown to be comparable to individ-
uals with a blood alcohol concentration of 0.05% [9],
which is the drink driving limit in Scotland [10]. This
level of fatigue may result in poor performance and
may contribute to errors [11]. Indeed, in New Zealand,
80%
of respondents
to a survey
of anaesthetists
reported making a fatigue-related error [12]. According
to a survey of shift workers in America conducted by
the National Sleep Foundation, shift workers are more
likely to drive when fatigued, and twice as likely to fall
asleep at the wheel compared with non-shift workers
[13].
A recent finding of the National Sleep Founda-
tion Drowsy Driving Consensus Working Group con-
firms that people who have slept for less than two
hours within the past 24 are unfit to drive a motor
vehicle [14]. Doctors may soon be faced with the
need to seek alternatives to driving after night shifts,
as
awareness
of
the
dangers
of
fatigued
driving
increases [15]. For doctors in many areas, there are
no public transport options that coincide with shift
patterns, and the cost of using taxi services may be
prohibitive. It is worth considering the specifications
of the new UK junior doctor contract which states
that; “where a doctor advises an employer that the
doctor feels. . .. unable to travel home due to tiredness,
the employer must, where possible, provide an appro-
priate rest facility where the doctor can sleep. . . Where
the provision of an appropriate rest facility is not pos-
sible the employer must make sure that alternative
arrangements are in place for the doctor’s safe travel
home” [16].
We conducted a national survey to assess the
impact of fatigue reported by trainees in anaesthesia in
the UK, and to enhance our understanding of factors
that may exacerbate the problem.
Methods
We designed an anonymous survey with 22 closed
(drop-down menus) and open (free-text entry) ques-
tions. These explored the degree to which respondents
were affected by fatigue, how frequently this occurred,
the adequacy of rest breaks, whether rest facilities were
available in their hospital, and any factors that influ-
enced decision-making around the self-management of
fatigue. We also sought information about clinical
experience when fatigued, and asked about road traffic
accidents and near misses. Although the survey was
anonymous, respondents were invited to provide their
contact details in the free-text section to allow for
clarification of free-text comments.
In February 2016, the survey was sent to anaesthe-
sia trainees in Wales. The response rate was high, and
early trends indicated concerning levels of fatigue in
the trainee population, prompting us to extend data
collection to Scotland, Northern Ireland and England

McClelland et al. | Survey of the effects of fatigue on trainees in anaesthesia in the UK
 from May 2016. Data collection ceased at the end of
December 2016. Paper copies of the survey were used
for the initial phase of data collection in Wales, but we
converted this to an online survey for ease of dissemi-
nation. We emailed individual anaesthetic departments
and Schools of Anaesthesia with a link to the ques-
tions. Frequent postings on social media led to a
steady increase in response rate. The Association of
Anaesthetists of Great Britain and Ireland (AAGBI)
and the Royal College of Anaesthetists (RCoA) assisted
in publicising the survey, with web links in their mem-
ber communications and by discussing the survey at
relevant events.
Several sources were considered for determination
of the denominator (the total number of trainees
working in anaesthetic training posts in the UK in
2016). These included the RCoA census, RCoA e-port-
folio and the GMC National Training Survey (NTS),
of which the latter was decided to be the most accurate
data source available [17]. The denominator number
was obtained via correspondence with the RCoA and
verified using the GMC National Training Survey
(NTS) reporting tool.
Results
A total of 2231 responses were received. Of these, 38
respondents described themselves as ‘other’ or ‘consul-
tant’, nine gave no answer to this question, and 14 sta-
ted that they were on maternity leave or working
overseas. These were discounted, which left 2170 trai-
nee responses.
The number of anaesthetic trainees who received
the GMC NTS was 3772 (information from the
RCoA), giving an estimated return rate of 57.5%. If
ACCS trainees, trainees on maternity or sick leave and
those out of programme are included, the denominator
increases to 4323. It is likely that many of these groups
would not have completed the survey, and we there-
fore interrogated the GMC NTS reporting system to
determine the number of trainees that were actually
working in UK training posts in 2016. From this, the
number of trainees with anaesthesia as a parent spe-
cialty was 3810; those working in an anaesthesia post
was 3656, and if this were extended to include Inten-
sive Care Medicine it rises to 4051. We believe that
the initially quoted number is a reasonable estimate
and have used this for the calculated response rate, but
it is possible that this ranges from 3656 to 4323. The
true response rate therefore lies between 50% and 60%.
There were replies from all 28 Schools of Anaes-
thesia
(Table 1).
However,
due
to
the
difficulties
described above, it has not been possible to obtain data
for the total number of trainees in each School of
Anaesthesia. There were replies from 225 (88.6%) of
the hospitals listed as having College Tutors on the
RCoA website. There was a balanced response from all
training grades (Table 2).
Table 3 and Fig. 1a–c show data regarding work
commutes. The average distance commuted one-way
was
17.8
miles
(95%CI
17.1–18.5).
This

between Schools of Anaesthesia, ranging from 3.6
(1.6–5.6) in the north of Scotland, to 33.5 (26.8–40.2)
in Yorkshire and Humber and the north-east of Eng-
land. More than three quarters of trainees use a car or
motorcycle to get to work, with nearly half using the
motorway as part of their commute; for those who

 use the motorway, the average commute is 26.9 miles
(25.8–28.0). Trainees from the London Schools of
Anaesthesia are the only group who used public trans-
port more frequently than their own vehicle, although
their travel times are generally in excess of 30 min-
utes. Of all trainees, 59.7% (57.6–61.7) travelled for
longer than 30 minutes on their journey home after a
night shift.
Of all respondents, 84.2% (82.7–85.7%) of respon-
dents stated that they had felt too tired to drive home
after a night shift, and 57% (55.0–59.1%) had experi-
enced an accident or near miss when driving home
after a night shift. In the free-text option, many talked
about falling asleep at the wheel and ‘microsleeps’.
Being woken by rumble strips was a recurrently cited
event. Individuals also described accidents from minor
bumps and scrapes, to significant incidents resulting in
their car being written off by insurers. Adverse events
were not only reported by motor vehicle users. There
were also multiple reports of such events amongst
walkers and cyclists.
We examined the availability of rest facilities for
trainees (Table 4). Only 31.9% (30.0–33.9%) of trainees
were aware of the existence of rest facilities where they
could sleep after a night shift. Only 16.8% (15.1–
18.5%) of respondents had ever used such a room to
sleep after a shift. Reasons given included ‘just wanting
to get home’, or the unsuitability and lack of accessi-
bility of facilities. Trainees in some areas are required
to pay for these rooms (10.7% [9.2–12.2%]). Ninety-
seven trainees gave specific costs, with a range between
£5 and £65 per shift. Some reported having to pay a
rate for two nights because they required the room
from the morning into the evening.
Overnight facilities appear to be better, but there
were still 739 respondents (34.3% [32.3–36.3%]) who
stated that they did not have access to adequate rest
facilities (bedroom/private area with bed or comfort-
able chair) during a shift.
Sleep around the time of, and during night shifts
is explored in Table 5. Most trainees are not getting
regular periods of uninterrupted sleep at work over-
night, and less than a quarter stated that they could
then sleep ‘well’ or ‘very well’ in between shifts. Of all
respondents, 87.9% (86.3–89.4%) use caffeine as a
stimulant to mitigate the effects of fatigue (Fig. 2).
Additional substances are used by some to attenuate
the impact of sleep disruption.
Finally, the survey looked at the subjective effects
of work-related fatigue. Most respondents described a
negative impact across a broad range of areas (Fig. 3).
Discussion
Our survey presents a worrying picture of both the fre-
quency and effects of fatigue among UK anaesthesia
trainees. High numbers of trainees cite fatigue as a
cause of suboptimal physical health, deterioration in
psychological wellbeing, impairment of ability to carry
out essential elements of training, including examina-
tions, audit and quality improvement projects. Addi-
tionally, over two-thirds of respondents stated that
personal relationships were adversely affected by fati-
gue, yet only just over half recognised that ability to
do their job was affected. This gives an important
insight into how UK trainees perceive a factor that
affects their ability to carry out a role. It could be sug-
gested that good physical and emotional health, good
quality interpersonal relationships and the capacity to
undertake academic work are the main foundations
that enable a trainee to thrive. High numbers of

McClelland et al. | Survey of the effects of fatigue on trainees in anaesthesia in the UK
 trainees report using caffeine-based stimulants in order
to preserve mental alertness when fatigued, and some
resort to the use of either alcohol, or sedatives (over-
the-counter or prescribed) to induce sleep.
The opportunity to rest for adequate periods in a
suitable environment whilst on a night shift is lacking
for many of those surveyed. This is likely to result in
fatigue, deterioration in cognitive function and poor
performance [11, 16]. We arbitrarily described ade-
quacy of such facilities as ‘a quiet room with a bed
or comfy chair’, but no formal minimum standard
exists, and thus, the answer to this question relies on
individual interpretation of an undefined standard. A
disturbing number of respondents reported involve-
ment in some kind of accident or near miss when
travelling home after a night shift. The indisputable
threat that this poses to the safety of trainees and
also the public is huge. There are likely to be more
stringent repercussions for those who are caught driv-
ing when fatigued in the future [18]. The time taken
for anaesthetic trainees to commute to and from
work is likely to be higher than for permanent
employees, due to the need to rotate to different hos-
pitals as part of training. Whilst there were no signifi-
cant variations in length of commute between Schools
of Anaesthesia, there may be a need to pay attention
to the organisation of rotations in the future to min-
imise frequent lengthy commutes. Hospitals and trai-
nees should also be encouraged to recognise that
commute times will impact negatively on the total
rest time between shifts.
Surprisingly, the survey revealed that a significant
proportion of trainees either did not know if post-shift
rest facilities were available to them or consciously

 chose not to use them. Many said that this was due to
facilities only being available for a short period, feeling
that short rests compounded overall fatigue and sleep
disturbance. This does not explain the widespread
reluctance to use the post-shift facilities, and while the
survey did not fully investigate the reasons for this, a
frequent free-text response stated a desire to ‘just get
home’. This highlights a need to both ensure proper
rest opportunities whilst on shift, and education about
individual
personal
responsibility
to
optimise
rest
before, during and after a night shift, so-called ‘good
sleep hygiene’.
The free-text comments included insightful infor-
mation regarding specific situations. They reflect how
important hospital size and the number of rota tiers
are to the workloads and rest opportunities of trainees
and on-call consultants alike. Multiple examples were
provided of nursing staff objecting to doctors resting
on shift, and in some instances intentionally disturbing
them. This may indicate a cultural issue in some hos-
pitals, potentially caused by difficult regulations sur-
rounding on-shift rest breaks for nursing staff with
deferral to ‘the employer’ regarding the possibility of
leaving the clinical area during a break [19–21]. It is
unclear why this cultural attitude which discourages
overnight rest whilst on shift has evolved, but it is
likely that the introduction of the European Working
Time Directive and Hospital at Night initiative have
influenced this significantly over the past 10 years.
Since the abolition of 24-h resident on calls, rest facili-
ties have been slowly removed from hospitals.
We have identified some limitations of the survey.
The response rate for a national survey was encourag-
ing, but there were a large number of trainees who did
not respond, and so conclusions must be interpreted
with due caution. However, even if all non-responders
answered the same way as the minority of respon-
dents, the scale of the problem lessens but remains sig-
nificant. For example, if all non-responders had never
felt too tired to drive home, the proportion who had
felt too tired to drive would reduce to 48.0% (1811/
3772). Similarly, the proportion who have had a road
traffic accident or near miss would be 32.6% (1229/
3772). These remain substantial proportions. Other
elements of the survey asked questions regarding the
accessibility of rest facilities and ability to take rest
breaks. Given the spread of responses from all Schools
of Anaesthesia and almost every hospital, it is likely
that the sample of responses captures the majority of
on-call rotas worked by trainee anaesthetists.

McClelland et al. | Survey of the effects of fatigue on trainees in anaesthesia in the UK
 Regarding limitations of the survey questions, a
drop-down menu of trusts should have been made
available, rather than requiring these details to be
entered as free text. It would have been useful to
obtain data regarding the nature of overnight work
and to investigate the possibility of partial bleep-filter-
ing systems in certain settings. The survey did not
include questions about trainees conducting anaesthe-
sia whilst fatigued because it was felt that respondents
may fear medico-legal repercussions, both individually
and for their organisation. The survey should have
encouraged respondents to add free-text comments
regarding their reluctance to use post-shift rest facili-
ties. The numbers reveal a low uptake of these services
where facilities exist, although the reasons for this are
still not clear.
A number of respondents have objected to the fact
that non-training grade doctors were excluded from

 the survey. We accept that similar problems affect this
group, but due to the difficulty in obtaining an accu-
rate number of individuals in non-training posts, it
was not deemed possible to achieve a denominator,
and hence to provide reliable statistics. We believe that
the changes generated by the ongoing fatigue work will
also directly benefit non-training grade anaesthetists
on resident shift rotas.
The consequences of fatigue on the safety of doc-
tors, patients and the general public can no longer be
ignored. A multi-pronged approach to detection, edu-
cation and prevention is required, to drive forward cul-
tural and organisational changes necessary to promote
good sleep hygiene in the National Health Service.
In part as a result of this survey, a ‘Fatigue Group’
has been established in association with the AAGBI, its
trainee arm (the Group of Anaesthetists in Training,
GAT) and the RCoA. The group’s projects include estab-
lishing a traffic-light grading system for rest facilities and
cultural attitudes toward fatigue in hospitals, with a view
to highlighting the best, and empowering those working
in trusts where there is little progress to advocate
changes. Similarly, responsibilities for individual doctors
will be defined. A comprehensive induction ‘Fatigue
Education Package’ will be piloted in Wales in the near
future. This contains short videos, infographics, local
rest facility information, fatigue monitoring tools and a
downloadable relaxation audio specifically designed for
doctors. Specific tools are being created to help guide
hospitals improve rest facilities and make workers aware
of the risks of fatigue. Proforma documents have been
designed, outlining the specific information that Trusts
are required to give to trainees about how to access both
on-shift and post-shift rest facilities. It is hoped that by
adopting this approach, individual hospitals will be
strongly encouraged to address the issues of fatigue and
provide rest facilities as this becomes the norm. Those
slower to adapt should make the same cultural and
organisational changes to catch up.
A large amount of the work of anaesthetists is
unpredictable and delivered out of hours. Shifts can be
very busy, and the sheer volume of work combined
with caring for very sick patients may make it impossi-
ble for an individual to take essential rest breaks dur-
ing a night shift. The structure of rotas varies widely
between hospitals depending on size, services offered,
number of allocated trainees and rota gaps. The free-
text responses highlighted the fact that incessant bleeps
and lack of cross cover can sometimes make it impos-
sible to take proper breaks.
To ensure that each doctor on shift takes recom-
mended
breaks,
other
specialties
have
introduced
bleep-filtering services in some hospitals, and these are
reported to prevent interruptions during rest periods.
The nature of anaesthetists’ work would restrict the
implementation of a full bleep screening strategy, but
adaptations of this policy may have potential benefits.
It is important that the team covering each night shift
work ensures that each team member takes breaks.
This is the subject of a trust-wide campaign recently
launched at Guy’s and St Thomas’ NHS Trust [22].
Action is needed on three levels if we are to
address the impact of fatigue on individual doctors
and on the quality and safety of the care they deliver.
We can draw on the extensive experience of the avia-
tion, rail and petrochemical industries to guide strate-
gies within healthcare [3]. Organisations should have a
strategy to minimise the likelihood of its employees
becoming excessively tired at work, with good rota
planning, appropriate staffing levels, and rest facilities
where staff can lie flat in a dark environment, both
during a break and following a shift [23]. Individual
doctors should understand the impact of fatigue, prac-
tice good sleep hygiene and take appropriate action if
they are becoming excessively fatigued [24]. The teams
in which we work must identify any team member
who is critically tired and having microsleeps, remove
them from the working environment, support them in
getting appropriate rest and ensure they do not drive
until they have rested.
Making good sleep hygiene the norm amongst
trainees in anaesthesia will be challenging for individ-
ual trusts and practitioners alike. We hope that by
highlighting the nature of the problem of fatigue, and
firmly supporting doctors and managers to shape pro-
gress, a solid platform for innovation and a shift in
attitude will be created.
