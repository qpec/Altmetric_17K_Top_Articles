BACKGROUND
Imatinib, a selective BCR-ABL1 kinase inhibitor, improved the prognosis for pa-
tients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). We conducted efficacy and safety 
analyses on the basis of more than 10 years of follow-up in patients with CML who 
were treated with imatinib as initial therapy.
METHODS
In this open-label, multicenter trial with crossover design, we randomly assigned 
patients with newly diagnosed CML in the chronic phase to receive either imatinib 
or interferon alfa plus cytarabine. Long-term analyses included overall survival, 
response to treatment, and serious adverse events.
RESULTS
The median follow-up was 10.9 years. Given the high rate of crossover among 
patients who had been randomly assigned to receive interferon alfa plus cytarabine 
(65.6%) and the short duration of therapy before crossover in these patients 
(median, 0.8 years), the current analyses focused on patients who had been ran-
domly assigned to receive imatinib. Among the patients in the imatinib group, the 
estimated overall survival rate at 10 years was 83.3%. Approximately half the pa-
tients (48.3%) who had been randomly assigned to imatinib completed study treat-
ment with imatinib, and 82.8% had a complete cytogenetic response. Serious ad-
verse events that were considered by the investigators to be related to imatinib 
were uncommon and most frequently occurred during the first year of treatment.
CONCLUSIONS
Almost 11 years of follow-up showed that the efficacy of imatinib persisted over 
time and that long-term administration of imatinib was not associated with unac-
ceptable cumulative or late toxic effects. (Funded by Novartis Pharmaceuticals; 
IRIS ClinicalTrials.gov numbers, NCT00006343 and NCT00333840.)

The new engl and jour nal of medicine
C
hronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a 
myeloproliferative neoplasm that is char-
acterized by the Philadelphia (Ph) chromo-
some and driven by its product, the BCR-ABL1 
tyrosine kinase.1 In 2001, imatinib was intro-
duced as a BCR-ABL1 tyrosine kinase inhibitor 
and was approved for the treatment of CML on 
the basis of a high level of activity in phase 2 
studies.2 Early results from the phase 3 Interna-
tional Randomized Study of Interferon and 
STI571 (IRIS) showed that imatinib at a dose of 
400 mg once daily was more active and was as-
sociated with fewer side effects than interferon 
alfa plus cytarabine in patients with newly diag-
nosed CML in the chronic phase.3 At 18 months, 
the estimated rate of complete cytogenetic re-
sponse (0% Ph-positive metaphases) was 76.2% 
(95% confidence interval [CI], 72.5 to 79.9) in 
the imatinib group, as compared with 14.5% 
(95% CI, 10.5 to 18.5) in the group that received 
interferon alfa plus cytarabine (nominal P<0.001), 
and the estimated rate of freedom from progres-
sion to the accelerated phase or blast crisis of 
CML was 96.7% versus 91.5% (nominal P<0.001).3
As a result, the majority of patients who had 
been randomly assigned to interferon alfa plus 
cytarabine crossed over to imatinib early in the 
trial, and the focus shifted from between-group 
comparisons to in-depth, exploratory analyses of 
outcomes with imatinib.4-6 A retrospective analysis 
that compared patients in the imatinib group of 
IRIS with those in a historical cohort of patients 
who had been treated with interferon alfa plus 
cytarabine in an earlier trial showed that imatinib 
therapy resulted in a higher rate of overall survival.7
This trial fundamentally changed CML treat-
ment and led to marked improvements in progno-
sis for patients.8 In the United States, the annual 
age-adjusted mortality rate among patients with 
CML decreased from 0.9 deaths per 100,000 per-
sons in 1996 to 0.4 deaths per 100,000 persons 
in 2006.9 Similar improvements have been ob-
served in patients with CML in other regions of 
the world,10,11 and survival among patients is now 
considered to be driven by coexisting conditions 
rather than by CML.12 Here we report the final 
analysis of IRIS.
Methods
Trial Design
We have described the design of the trial previ-
ously.3 In brief, eligible patients were 18 to 70 
years of age and had previously untreated (except 
with hydroxyurea or anagrelide), Ph-positive CML 
in the chronic phase that had been diagnosed 
within 6 months before trial entry. Patients were 
randomly assigned to receive imatinib (at an oral 
dose of 400 mg per day) or interferon alfa (ad-
ministered subcutaneously at a dose of 5 million 
IU per square meter of body-surface area daily) 
plus cytarabine (administered subcutaneously for 
10 days every month at a dose of 20 mg per square 
meter daily) (see the protocol, available with the 
full text of this article at NEJM.org).
Crossover was allowed for lack of response 
(defined as no complete hematologic response by 
6 months or no major cytogenetic response by 
12 months; response definitions are provided 
in the Methods section in the Supplementary Ap-
pendix, available at NEJM.org), disease progres-
sion (white-cell count, >20×109 per liter), loss of 
complete hematologic response or major cytoge-
netic response, unacceptable side effects, or re-
luctance to continue taking interferon alfa plus 
cytarabine after the trial results were released. 
After 7 years, the trial was extended for imatinib 
only. Patients in the group that received inter-
feron alfa plus cytarabine were eligible to con-
tinue in the trial if they crossed over to imatinib.
End Points
The initial primary end point was event-free sur-
vival (defined as survival without progression to 
accelerated phase or blast crisis, loss of complete 
hematologic response, loss of major cytogenetic 
response, or death from any cause during treat-
ment),3 and the long-term primary end point was 
overall survival in the imatinib group. Secondary 
end points included response rates, time to re-
sponse, disease progression, safety, and side-
effect profile. Assessments of the patients’ overall 
prognosis were made with the use of the scoring 
system devised by Sokal et al.13 The Sokal score 
is based on age, spleen size, peripheral-blood 
platelet count, and blast count. A Sokal score of 
less than 0.8 indicates low risk, a score of 0.8 to 
1.2 intermediate risk, and a score of more than 
1.2 high risk. Additional information about the 
end points and assessments is provided in the 
Methods section in the Supplementary Appendix.
Trial Oversight
All the patients provided written informed con-
sent. The trial was approved by the institutional 
review board at each participating institution

and was conducted in accordance with the provi-
sions of the Declaration of Helsinki. All the au-
thors analyzed the trial data, were involved in 
the development of the manuscript, and had re-
sponsibility for the decision to submit the manu-
script for publication. The trial sponsor (Novartis 
Pharmaceuticals), in collaboration with the trial 
investigators, participated in the design of the 
trial and analyzed the data. The sponsor and the 
authors vouch for the accuracy and completeness 
of the data and analyses and for the fidelity of 
the trial to the protocol. Financial support for 
medical editorial assistance was provided by the 
sponsor.
Statistical Analysis
Because of the high rate of crossover and the 
subsequent closing of the group of patients re-
ceiving interferon alfa plus cytarabine, most long-
term analyses (including safety, response rates, 
and landmark analyses) included only patients 
who had been randomly assigned to imatinib. 
Cytogenetic and molecular response rates in the 
imatinib group at each time point were calculated 
in the intention-to-treat population and among 
the patients who could be evaluated (i.e., patients 
with cytogenetic or quantitative reverse transcrip-
tase–polymerase chain reaction [RT-PCR] assess-
ments that could be evaluated) at the indicated 
time point.
Exploratory molecular monitoring of BCR-ABL1 
transcript levels in peripheral blood used quan-
titative RT-PCR assessments that were performed 
at reference laboratories as described in the Meth-
ods section in the Supplementary Appendix. This 
analysis formed the basis for the development of 
the International Scale: major molecular response 
(now represented by a BCR-ABL1 level of ≤0.1% 
on the International Scale) was defined as a re-
duction of at least 3 log in the BCR-ABL1 value 
from the standardized baseline level on the In-
ternational Scale, and molecular response 4.5 
was defined as an undetectable level of BCR-ABL1 
in a sample tested with the sensitivity to detect 
a reduction of at least 4.5 log from the standard-
ized baseline value that was confirmed in a sec-
ond assessment or a BCR-ABL1 value of 0.0032% 
or less on the International Scale with at least 
32,000 copies of ABL1 or at least 400,000 copies 
of BCR; these definitions are consistent with the 
definitions proposed by the European Leukemia-
Net14 and with those used in other studies.15,16
Serious adverse events and reasons for the 
discontinuation of study treatment were docu-
mented throughout follow-up. Information about 
other adverse events, biochemical evaluations, 
and concomitant medication use was not col-
lected after 5.5 years.
Results
Enrollment and Follow-up of the Patients
We enrolled 1106 patients at 177 centers in 16 
countries; 553 patients were assigned to each 
group. The first patient was enrolled in June 
2000, and the last visit of the last patient was in 
January 2012. The characteristics of the patients 
at baseline were reported previously and were 
similar between groups.3 The median duration 
of follow-up was 10.9 years (range, 0 to 11.7, 
including follow-up after the discontinuation of 
study treatment).
Among patients who had been randomly as-
signed to imatinib, 267 (48.3%) completed treat-
ment with the assigned study drug; 7 patients 
(1.3%) who had been randomly assigned to in-
terferon alfa plus cytarabine completed treatment 
with that regimen (Fig. 1 and Table 1, and Table 
S1 in the Supplementary Appendix). Among the 
patients who had been randomly assigned to 
interferon alfa plus cytarabine, 363 (65.6%) 
crossed over to imatinib because of disease pro-
gression or lack or loss of response (31.5%), 
unacceptable side effects (26.2%), or reluctance 
to continue taking interferon alfa plus cytara-
bine (8.0%). The median duration of first-line 
therapy with interferon alfa plus cytarabine be-
fore crossover was 0.8 years (range, <0.1 to 8.0). 
By contrast, 15.9% of the patients in the ima-
tinib group discontinued the study treatment 
because of an unsatisfactory therapeutic effect, 
and 6.9% discontinued because of adverse events 
(Table S2 in the Supplementary Appendix). The 
median duration of first-line imatinib therapy 
was 8.9 years (range, <0.1 to 11.7).
Safety
A total of 51 of 551 patients (9.3%) receiving 
first-line therapy with imatinib had a serious 
adverse event (most frequently abdominal pain, 
in 4 patients [0.7%]) that was considered by the 
investigators to be related to the study drug. 
The frequency of such events was highest during 
the first year of treatment and declined over time. 
Cardiac serious adverse events of any cause were 
reported in 39 patients (7.1%), and serious adverse

events of a second neoplasm (benign or malig-
nant) were reported in 62 (11.3%). No new safety 
signals were observed since the 5-year analysis.4 
(Details are provided in Tables S3 through S6 in 
the Supplementary Appendix.)
Progression and Survival
In the imatinib group in the intention-to-treat 
population, 38 of 553 patients (6.9%) had pro-
gression to the accelerated phase or blast crisis17 
during study treatment, and the estimated rate 
of freedom from progression to the accelerated 
phase or blast crisis at 10 years was 92.1% (95% 
CI, 89.6 to 94.5). A total of 71 patients (12.8%) 
in the group that received interferon alfa plus 
cytarabine had progression to the accelerated 
phase or blast crisis during study treatment. In 
the two trial groups, most events of disease pro-
gression (in 34 of 38 patients in the imatinib 
group and in 64 of 71 in the group that received 
interferon alfa plus cytarabine) occurred during 
the first 4 years of study treatment. The esti-
mated rate of event-free survival at 10 years was 
79.6% (95% CI, 75.9 to 83.2) among the patients 
randomly assigned to imatinib, as compared 
with 56.6% (95% CI, 51.5 to 61.6) among those 
assigned to interferon alfa plus cytarabine (Table 
S7 in the Supplementary Appendix).
The estimated overall survival rate at 10 years 
among patients receiving first-line imatinib treat-
ment was 83.3% (95% CI, 80.1 to 86.6) (Fig. 2). 
A total of 260 patients (47.0%) were alive and 
still receiving study treatment at 10 years, 96 pa-
tients (17.4%) were alive and not receiving study 
treatment, 86 known deaths (15.6% of patients) 
had occurred, and 111 patients (20.1%) had un-
known survival status (the age distribution and 
other characteristics at baseline were generally

Long-Term Outcomes of Imatinib for CML
similar between patients with known survival 
status and those with unknown survival status) 
(Table S8 in the Supplementary Appendix). After 
we accounted for patients with unknown survival 
status, the estimated survival rates at 10 years 
ranged from 64.4% (assuming all 111 patients 
had died on the date of their last known follow-
up) to 84.4% (assuming all 111 were alive).
Patients with a high Sokal score had a worse 
estimated overall survival rate at 10 years (68.6%) 
than those with an intermediate score (80.3%) 
or a low score (89.9%), in an analysis that was 
not adjusted for patients with unknown survival 
status (Table S9 in the Supplementary Appendix). 
Overall, by the end of the trial, 89 patients 
(16.1%) in the imatinib group were known to 
have died from any cause; 37 of the deaths were 
related to CML in patients who had not under-
gone hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation 
(16 of these 37 deaths occurred in year 5 or later) 
(Table 2).
In the group that received interferon alfa plus 
cytarabine in the intention-to-treat population, 
105 patients (19.0%) were known to have died 
from any cause by the end of the trial; 48 deaths 
were related to CML in patients who had not 
undergone hematopoietic stem-cell transplanta-
tion. A total of 165 patients (29.8%) had an un-
known survival status at 10 years. The high rate 
of crossover precluded a direct comparison of 
overall survival between the imatinib group and 
the group that received interferon alfa plus cyta-
rabine. However, a hazard ratio of 0.74 (95% CI, 
0.56 to 0.99) indicated a 26% lower risk of death 
with first-line imatinib therapy than with inter-
feron alfa plus cytarabine (nominal P 
= 
0.04 by the 
log-rank test).
Cytogenetic and Molecular Responses
In the imatinib group, the cumulative rate of 
major cytogenetic response at the end of the 
trial was 89.0%, and the rate of complete cyto-
genetic response at the end of the trial was 
82.8% (Table S10 in the Supplementary Appendix). 
The median time to response was 3.0 months 
(interquartile range, 2.9 to 5.7) among patients 
who had a major cytogenetic response and 5.8 
months (interquartile range, 3.0 to 11.1) among 
those who had a complete cytogenetic response. 
An estimated 49.1% of all the patients in the 
imatinib group had a complete cytogenetic re-
sponse at 6 months. A total of 66 of 416 patients 
(15.9%) who had had a confirmed complete cy-
togenetic response at any time during the trial 
no longer had that response by the time of data 
cutoff, including 9 patients who had progression 
to the accelerated phase or blast crisis.

The new engl and jour nal of medicine
Among 134 patients with cytogenetic assess-
ments at 10 years, 123 (91.8%) had a complete 
cytogenetic response, whereas 11 did not (a lack 
of response was confirmed by means of molecu-
lar assessments in 4 of these 11 patients) (Table 3, 
and Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix). 
Among 204 patients who had molecular assess-
ments that could be evaluated at 10 years, 190 
(93.1%) had a major molecular response and 129 
(63.2%) had molecular response 4.5. Some of 
these patients may have been eligible for studies 
investigating treatment-free remission, but this 
was not prospectively investigated within the pres-
ent trial.
Among the 304 patients taking first-line ima-
tinib who could be evaluated for a molecular re-
sponse at 12 months, the estimated overall sur-
vival rate at 10 years was 91.1% among those with 
a major molecular response, as compared with 
85.3% among those without a major molecular 
response at 12 months (Table 4). In an analysis 
that included only CML-related deaths, the esti-
mated survival rate at 10 years was 97.8% among 
patients with a major molecular response, as com-
pared with 89.4% among those without a major 
molecular response. Similar trends were observed 
in the comparison of survival rates at 10 years 
among patients with a major molecular response

Shown is the overall survival over time among patients assigned to each trial group. For the curve for the group of 
patients who had been randomly assigned to receive interferon alfa plus cytarabine, data include survival among 
the 363 patients who crossed over to imatinib (65.6%). These patients crossed over to imatinib after a median of  
0.8 years of receiving interferon alfa plus cytarabine. In patients with no reported death (whether because they were 
known to be alive or because their survival status was unknown), survival was censored (tick marks) at the date of 
last contact.

Long-Term Outcomes of Imatinib for CML
at 18 months and those without such a response 
(overall survival rate, 93.0% vs. 85.6%; rate of free-
dom from CML-related death, 100% vs. 90.5%).
Discussion
With more than 10 years of follow-up in IRIS, the 
long-term outcomes in imatinib-treated patients 
that we describe here confirm and extend earlier 
findings. No new safety signals and few drug-
related serious adverse events were observed dur-
ing the later years of follow-up, and molecular 
and cytogenetic response rates were high among 
the patients who could be evaluated. The esti-
mated overall survival rate at 10 years with first-
line imatinib therapy was 83.3%, which is simi-
lar to the rate (84%) reported among patients 
who were treated with imatinib-based regimens 
in the CML-IV study, which was initiated shortly 
after IRIS to further evaluate alternative dosing 
strategies and drug combinations in patients with 
newly diagnosed CML in the chronic phase.18

A complete cytogenetic response was defined as 0% Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome–positive cells in metaphase. Major molecular response 
was defined as a reduction of at least 3 log in the BCR-ABL1 value from the standardized baseline level on the International Scale, and molecu-
lar response 4.5 as an undetectable level of BCR-ABL1 in a sample tested with the sensitivity to detect a reduction of at least 4.5 log from 
the standardized baseline level that was confirmed in a second assessment or a BCR-ABL1 value of 0.0032% or less on the International 
Scale with at least 32,000 copies of ABL1 or at least 400,000 copies of BCR. Owing to protocol amendments and for practical reasons, fewer 
(and to some extent different) patients were analyzed for cytogenetic response at 8, 9, and 10 years than were analyzed for molecular response. 
Thus for these time points, the percentage of patients in the intention-to-treat population who had a complete cytogenetic response cannot 
be compared with that of patients who had a major molecular response or molecular response 4.5.

data, including the large number of patients who 
had an unknown survival status (approximately 
20% of the patients in the imatinib group) or 
who did not have molecular or cytogenetic assess-
ments that could be evaluated (approximately 
half the patients who completed the trial while 
taking imatinib had cytogenetic assessments at 
10 years that could be evaluated) and the limited 
collection of long-term safety information. None-
theless, these results highlight the safety and 
efficacy of imatinib therapy, with a clear im-
provement over the outcomes that were expected 
in patients who received a diagnosis of CML be-
fore the introduction of tyrosine kinase inhibitor 
therapy, when interferon alfa and hematopoi-
etic stem-cell transplantation were the standard 
therapies.19,20
The ability of imatinib to reduce rates of dis-
ease progression and CML-related death (and 
the resulting increase in the rate of overall sur-
vival) has made it a model for targeted cancer 
therapy.21 Although high rates of response have 
now also been observed with targeted therapies 
in patients who have other cancers with well-
characterized molecular abnormalities, including 
BRAF-driven melanoma and epidermal growth 
factor receptor (EGFR)–mutated lung cancer, the 
durability of responses observed with targeted 
therapies for these cancers is much less impres-
sive (and similar to the results with imatinib in 
patients with CML in blast crisis).21 These find-
ings are likely to be attributable to CML in the 
chronic phase being driven solely by BCR-ABL1, 
whereas solid tumors and the advanced phases 
of CML may be driven by multiple pathways and 
complex genomic abnormalities,21 which further 
underscores the importance of initiating treat-
ment early in the course of the disease.
While the IRIS trial was under way, new rec-
ommendations for CML treatment22 and new 
BCR-ABL1 inhibitors23-26 were developed. Each of 
the newer agents has a distinct safety and effi-

A total of 305 patients were considered able to be evaluated for molecular response at 12 months; however, 1 patient 
discontinued study treatment at 11 months (the patient was considered able to be evaluated for molecular response at 
12 months on the basis of an 11-month assessment) and was therefore excluded from the 12-month landmark analysis. 
Patients who died or who had data censored before each landmark analysis were excluded from that landmark analysis. 
The deaths reported here are those that occurred in patients with the indicated level of molecular response at 12 months 
or 18 months who died at some point after 12 months or 18 months, respectively. Two-sided P values were calculated 
with the use of the log-rank test. CML denotes chronic myeloid leukemia.

Long-Term Outcomes of Imatinib for CML
cacy profile,23-26 and two (nilotinib and dasatinib) 
have been approved as first-line therapies in pa-
tients with CML in the chronic phase on the 
basis of results from phase 3 trials in which they 
were associated with higher response rates than 
imatinib (although a higher dose of imatinib 
may also increase the rates of response).15,16,23,24,27 
Furthermore, nilotinib resulted in lower rates of 
progression to the accelerated phase and blast 
crisis and CML-related death than imatinib.16 
However, despite the better early control of dis-
ease observed with second-generation tyrosine 
kinase inhibitors than with imatinib, it remains 
to be seen whether they will have similarly favor-
able long-term safety. Given the long-term safety 
and efficacy results with imatinib and the increas-
ing availability of generic imatinib, comparative 
analyses evaluating the available tyrosine kinase 
inhibitors for first-line therapy are likely to be 
forthcoming.
As experience with imatinib accrued through-
out the course of this trial, the treatment of pa-
tients who were taking a tyrosine kinase inhibi-
tor improved over time. For example, after issues 
related to poor adherence to the oral-drug regi-
mens became apparent (more so in routine clini-
cal practice than among patients enrolled in 
clinical trials), physicians learned to conduct 
more specific consultations with patients to en-
sure that they were taking their medication as 
prescribed.
Survival rates in our trial were especially high 
in certain subgroups of patients, including those 
who had a major molecular response at 12 
months or 18 months and those with low Sokal 
scores. These results are consistent with previous 
reports from IRIS and other studies showing that 
early responses to tyrosine kinase inhibitor ther-
apy are valuable prognostic markers for long-term 
outcomes and that patients with low risk scores 
(according to Sokal,13 Hasford,28 or European 
Treatment and Outcome Study29 scores) at base-
line typically have high rates of complete cytoge-
netic response and overall survival while taking 
any of the available tyrosine kinase inhibi-
tors.4,6,16,27,30,31 The risk profile of our trial cohort, 
according to Sokal score, was similar to that in 
other studies.23,32
Imatinib treatment has also allowed for the 
successful stopping of therapy (for >5 years) in 
small subgroups of patients with a sustained 
deep molecular response (molecular response 4 
[defined as a reduction of 4 log in the BCR-ABL1 
value from the standardized baseline level on 
the International Scale], molecular response 4.5, 
or undetectable BCR-ABL1 transcripts), which pro-
motes treatment-free remission as a treatment 
goal.33 Approximately 39 to 45% of patients who 
attempt treatment-free remission after having a 
durable deep molecular response with imatinib 
therapy can remain in remission for 3 years or 
longer.33 The eligibility rate for an attempt at 
treatment-free remission has been estimated 
to be 21.6% after 6 years of imatinib therapy (on 
the basis of maintenance of a stable deep molecu-
lar response for ≥12 months).34 Thus, the total 
percentage of imatinib-treated patients who may 
have a stable treatment-free remission is approxi-
mately 10%. Because a greater percentage of pa-
tients have deep molecular responses with second-
generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors than with 
imatinib across all risk strata, second-generation 
agents may enable a larger proportion of patients 
in all Sokal-score risk groups to be eligible to 
attempt treatment-free remission.16,27
Although long-term survival data were incom-
plete, the observation that many of the reported 
deaths in the imatinib group were unrelated to 
CML is in line with published data showing that 
patients who have a response to imatinib have a 
survival rate that is equivalent to that in the 
general population and are unlikely to die from 
CML.35 This trend also highlights the impor-
tance of monitoring and managing coexisting 
conditions in patients with CML in the chronic 
phase. As the prognosis that is associated with 
CML in the chronic phase improves and as pa-
tients can be expected to live for years or decades, 
an increasing number of patients will be at risk 
for death from general health conditions or co-
existing conditions rather than from CML.31,35 In 
particular, of the few deaths reported in the low-
risk Sokal-score group, most were unrelated to 
CML (and were likely to be related to the coexist-
ing-condition profile that is typical of this age 
group12). In contrast, patients with a high Sokal 
score typically died from CML. As is consistent 
with a previous analysis of the outcomes in pa-
tients who crossed over from interferon alfa plus 
cytarabine to imatinib,36 the long-term overall 
survival rate in the group that received interferon 
alfa plus cytarabine was high, which suggests

that second-line imatinib was an effective therapy 
in many of these patients.
Several new questions have arisen, such as the 
relative benefits and risks of imatinib versus 
newer tyrosine kinase inhibitors and the role and 
effect of second-line inhibitor therapy. Approxi-
mately half the patients in the imatinib group 
discontinued the trial early, which suggests that 
the high rate of overall survival in the imatinib 
group must be attributed to the use of commer-
cially available imatinib or effective second-line 
therapies in these patients.25,26,37,38 Despite these 
unanswered questions, the long-term results pre-
sented here highlight the clinical benefits ob-
served in patients with CML over the past 15 years.
