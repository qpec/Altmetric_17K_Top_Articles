Abstract
Background—Many young adult female cancer survivors (YAFCS) are at risk for premature 
menopause. This study characterized YAFCS’ post-treatment fertility information needs, 
reproductive concerns, and decisional conflict about future options for post-treatment fertility 
preservation (FP).
Methods—Participants completed a web-based, anonymous survey between February and March 
2015. The survey included investigator-designed questions of perceived information needs, the 
Reproductive Concerns after Cancer Scale (RCACS), and the Decisional Conflict Scale (DCS). 
Analyses included Pearson’s correlations, t-tests, and multiple regression.
Results—Participants (N=346) averaged 29.9 years old (SD=4.1) and were 4.9 years post-
treatment (SD=5.4; range, 0-27). Main analyses focused on a subgroup of YAFCS with uncertain 
fertility status who had not previously undergone/attempted FP and either wanted future children 
or were unsure (n=179). Across fertility information topics, 43-62% reported unmet information 
needs. The greatest reproductive concerns related to fertility potential and health of future 
offspring. The regression model controlled for a priori covariates including current age, age at 
treatment completion, income, relationship status, nulliparity, and prior fertility evaluation. Greater 
unmet information needs related to greater decisional conflict (β=0.43, p<.001); greater 
reproductive concerns were associated at the trend level (β=0.14, p=.08; F[8,118]=6.42, p<.001).

 Conclusions—YAFCS with limited awareness or knowledge of their risk for premature 
menopause and FP options report higher levels of decisional conflict about future FP. Post-
treatment survivorship care should include comprehensive reproductive health counseling, 
including post-treatment FP options and family-building alternatives.

An estimated 1 in 47 women will be diagnosed with invasive cancer as a young adult.1 The 
gonadotoxic effects of many cancer treatments are well established, and providers are 
increasingly addressing fertility issues with their patients.2,3 However, most women do not 
pursue fertility preservation (FP) before treatment, despite wanting biological children in the 
future.3,4 Reasons include not being aware of fertility risks or FP options, time pressures, 
emotional distress, financial costs, and discomfort with the idea of using donor sperm for 
embryo freezing, in the period before egg freezing was available.5,6 Health care providers 
are also less likely to discuss fertility risks and FP with children and adolescents because of 
their focus on survival and the lack of non-experimental options prior to pubertal onset.7
For young adult female survivors not ready to start a family, post-treatment FP may be an 
option, but it is an underutilized service.8 Many survivors will indeed maintain reproductive 
potential after treatment but remain at risk for premature ovarian failure (early menopause), 
with a narrowed window of reproductive opportunity. Despite this, young adult survivors 
often do not receive recommended follow-up care regarding their reproductive health.9 
Clinicians also self-report as feeling inadequately informed about cancer-related fertility 
issues and may underestimate patients’ concerns or fail to recognize fertility as a priority.7,10 
Fertility information is one of the most cited unmet needs among young adult survivors in 
pre- and post-treatment care.11,12 Lack of awareness of post-treatment fertility status and 
uncertainty about reproductive potential has been linked to reduced mental health and 
quality of life.13–15
Research suggests variability in how female cancer survivors cope with uncertainty and 
distress related to potential fertility problems. Some women report that fertility concerns 
dominate their thoughts in survivorship and describe a preoccupation with the “missed 
opportunity” to have preserved their fertility prior to treatment along with anxiety and 
regret.16,17 Others minimize or avoid fertility-related thoughts in an effort to prioritize 
normality and reduce anxiety and grief.18–20 Based on research highlighting distress 
associated with confirmed infertility, survivors may be negatively affected if they experience 
premature menopause unexpectedly, without having the chance to consider their FP options.
For many women, the option to preserve fertility may be feasible and medically appropriate, 
making the decision “preference-sensitive,” based on personal values.21,22 These types of 
decisions often invoke decisional conflict, particularly when the likelihood of expected 
outcomes is not definite.23 Retrospectively, most female cancer survivors report clinically 
significant levels of decisional conflict about pre-treatment FP decisions.5,24,25 The 
experiences of post-treatment survivors considering future FP, however, are not well 
understood.

 A better understanding of how young women understand their reproductive health and make 
decisions about the FP options available to them after treatment is needed. This will help to 
promote informed, values-based decision-making; enabling survivors to take advantage of 
available reproductive technology when desired and appropriate, and avoid potential future 
distress. The goals of this study were to describe survivors’ unmet information needs about 
fertility topics, their reproductive concerns, and the degree of decisional conflict they 
experienced when prompted to consider the decision to pursue FP in the future. In order to 
identify potential factors contributing to decision-making distress, the extent to which unmet 
information needs and reproductive concerns related to decisional conflict about future FP 
was also evaluated.
Methods
Design
Cross-sectional, internet-based survey designed to measure the fertility-related experiences 
of young adult female cancer survivors who had completed therapy. Surveys were 
administered between February – March, 2015. This study was approved as exempt research 
by the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK) Institutional Review Board.
Participants
Eligibility criteria included female survivors between the ages of 18 to 35 years old with a 
prior cancer diagnosis, who had successfully completed treatment at least one year prior, and 
were disease-free.
Survey
The survey was designed by an interdisciplinary team with input from young adult female 
survivors. The survey was anonymous and protected health information was not collected. 
Standard questions were used to assess sociodemographic, medical, and fertility-related 
information. Reasons for not pursuing FP before treatment were assessed using items 
derived from Kim et al.5 Participants responded yes/no to a list of factors shown to be 
important in the FP decision-making process with the option to select more than one (e.g., 
time constraints, emotional distress, and cost).5 The survey was administered online using a 
commercially available website with SSL encryption. Participants were recruited through 
MSK and 17 young adult cancer survivor advocacy groups, using social media and email 
listservs. These procedures are consistent with recommended use of social media in young 
adult oncology research26–28 and similar to previously published studies with this 
population.16,29 Respondents were required to answer screener items to confirm eligibility.
Unmet information needs—Investigator-designed questions (5 items) assessed unmet 
information needs about fertility topics. Participants indicated (yes/no) whether they had as 
much information as they wanted about risk of infertility, risk of early menopause, options to 
assess their fertility status, options to preserve their fertility, and options for alternative 
family-building. A total score was calculated by summing the items (yes=0, no=1; range 
0-5) such that higher scores indicate greater unmet information needs (Cronbach’s alpha=.
81).

 Reproductive concerns—The Reproductive Concerns after Cancer Scale (RCACS) is an 
18-item, validated measure that includes six subscales (3 items each): Fertility Potential, 
Partner Disclosure, Child’s Health, Personal Health, Acceptance (reverse coded), and 
Becoming Pregnant.30 Responses are on a 5-point Likert scale from “Strongly disagree” to 
“Strongly agree” with total scores ranging from 18 to 90. Mean total and subscale scores 
were calculated with higher scores indicating greater reproductive concerns (Cronbach’s 
alpha=.83).
Decisional conflict about future FP—The “low health literacy” version of the 
Decisional Conflict Scale (DCS) was used to assess four domains of personal uncertainty in 
making a healthcare decision. This version of the DCS was chosen as a precaution given the 
online format and anonymity of the survey prevented formal assessment of participants’ 
reading skills. Subscales include: feeling uninformed, unclear about values, unsupported in 
decision-making, and feeling uncertain about which option to choose.31 The DCS is valid 
and reliable,23 and the most widely used measure of decision-making quality.32 The current 
study included 8 items of the 10-item scale and good internal reliability was demonstrated 
(Cronbach’s alpha=.84). Total possible scores range from 0 to 100 with higher scores 
indicating greater decisional conflict.
Statistical Analyses
Descriptive statistics characterized the sample and reasons for not undergoing pre-treatment 
FP. Differences among the most common diagnoses were examined using ANOVAs and chi-
square. Main analyses excluded participants who reported infertility or inability to carry a 
pregnancy, did not want future children, or had previously attempted or undergone egg or 
embryo cryopreservation or ovarian transposition. Independent samples t-tests and Pearson’s 
correlations evaluated bivariate relations among unmet information needs, reproductive 
concerns, and decisional conflict about future FP in the remaining subgroup. A regression 
model examined how unmet information needs and reproductive concerns contributed to 
decisional conflict about future FP. A priori covariates included current age, age at treatment 
completion, income, relationship status, nulliparity, and prior fertility evaluation. Missing 
data was not replaced. Percentages that are not based on the total sample of N=346 are 
specified.
Results
Among 714 respondents who accessed the survey, 359 (50%) met eligibility criteria and 346 
of eligible respondents (97%) completed the survey. Participants primarily resided in the 
United States (84%) and were from suburban (49%), urban (32%), and rural (10%) areas. 
Average age at survey completion was 29.9 years old (SD=4.1). Participants were a mean of 
23.6 years (SD=7.5) at the time of treatment completion; 35 (10%) were less than 15 years 
of age at diagnosis. The most common diagnoses were lymphoma (23%), breast (20%), 
gynecologic (14%), and leukemia (13%) with lymphoma and leukemia patients being 
younger with a longer time since treatment than other disease groups. Sociodemographic 
and clinical/fertility information are provided in Tables 1 and 2, respectively.

 Fifty-six women (16%) underwent FP pre-treatment; four underwent FP post-treatment; and 
three attempted FP post-treatment but were unsuccessful. Women reported multiple reasons 
for not having pursued pre-treatment FP. Most common reasons were not knowing about FP 
(30%), feeling too distressed or overwhelmed (29%), and/or cost (27%).
At the time of survey completion, 106 (31%) participants had been told that they will not be 
able to get pregnant or carry a pregnancy due to treatment effects; 21 (20%) of those women 
had preserved their fertility before treatment. Notably, 92% of this subgroup wanted children 
in the future. Gynecologic and leukemia survivors were more likely to be infertile, but 
differences in relationship status, nulliparity, or prior fertility evaluation were not significant 
across disease groups.
Subgroup analyses
The primary subgroup of interest was women who wanted children in the future or were 
unsure, had not been told they were infertile, had not undergone ovarian transposition, and 
had not previously attempted or undergone egg or embryo cryopreservation. The following 
analyses were conducted in this subgroup (n=179; see Tables 1 and 2 for descriptive data).
Regarding unmet information needs, most respondents felt they did not have enough 
information on infertility risk (58%), early menopause risk (60%), options to assess their 
fertility (62%), options to preserve their fertility (51%), and options for alternative family-
building (43%). The greatest reproductive concerns (M=3.20, SD=0.65) were related to 
concerns about potential fertility problems and health of a future child. For example, 64% 
were concerned they may not be able to have (more) children, 41% reported it was stressful 
to think about getting pregnant, and 59% were worried about passing on a genetic risk for 
cancer. Potential interpersonal difficulties were also indicated; 53% of women were 
concerned their partner or a future partner would be disappointed if they were unable to have 
children.
When prompted to consider the option of pursuing FP in the future, participants indicated 
high levels of decisional conflict (M=61.09, SD=24.88). Only 13% felt informed about their 
FP options and 74% were unclear about their personal values related to the decision. 
Notably, 70% felt they did not have enough advice, and 35% felt they did not have enough 
support to make a decision.
In bivariate analysis, greater decisional conflict was associated with having greater unmet 
information needs (Information Needs total, r=.47, p<.001) and reproductive concerns 
(RCACS total, r=.26, p=.001). Across all information topics, women who indicated that they 
had unmet information needs reported higher levels of decisional conflict (Figure 1; p <.01).
In multiple regression analysis controlling for current age, age at treatment completion, 
income, relationship status, nulliparity, and prior fertility evaluation, the relation between 
greater unmet information needs (β=0.43, p<.001) and higher levels of decisional conflict 
about future FP remained significant; greater reproductive concerns were associated with 
greater conflict at the trend level (β=0.14, p=.08; F[8,118]=6.42, p<.001). Having undergone 
a fertility evaluation post-treatment related to lower decisional conflict (β=-0.19, p=.02).

 Unmet information needs and reproductive concerns accounted for 22% of the variance in 
decisional conflict (Fchange[2,118]=18.79, p<.001; R2 total=.30). See Table 3.
Discussion
Many young adult female cancer survivors report a desire for biological children in the 
future but, for a variety of reasons, are unable to undergo FP prior to treatment. Those who 
maintain reproductive capacity after treatment, but are at risk for premature menopause, may 
have a second opportunity to pursue FP. This study is the first to our knowledge to examine 
the decisional conflict of young female survivors’ when prompted to consider post-treatment 
FP. For those who hope to have children in the future, failure to provide information and 
address concerns with respect to fertility-related decisions may have lasting consequences 
for their future family-building options.
Consistent with existing literature, we report high rates of unmet fertility information needs 
and reproductive concerns.11,12,33 To best inform clinical practice, we focused on the 
subgroup of women who had not been told they were infertile, believed they may want 
children in the future, and had not previously undergone FP. This subgroup of women 
reported high levels of decisional conflict about future FP. In other healthcare contexts, 
decisional conflict is associated with greater emotional distress, future decision regret, and 
greater likelihood of blaming providers.34 Unmet information and support needs increase 
decisional conflict and the risk for regret and distress.35–38 Women who receive pre-
treatment fertility counseling experience less regret and report better quality of life post-
treatment.17,39,40 However, fertility counseling alone may still result in low knowledge about 
fertility issues,41,42 suggesting more comprehensive approaches to providing decision 
support may be warranted.
Decisional conflict is also associated with an increased likelihood of avoiding or delaying 
decisions.34 Quinn et al. found that adolescent female survivors used a range of strategies to 
cope with potential fertility loss, including avoidance and denial of distressing cognitions.19 
Notably, all of the adolescents in their sample reported a desire for biologic children, but 
neither they nor their parents were aware of the adolescents’ fertility status.19 Likewise, 
survivors have also reported a desire to postpone addressing fertility issues until they were 
ready to have children.43 Women who delay decision-making about FP may lose the option 
to take advantage of reproductive technologies and preserve their fertility post-treatment, if 
desired.
Importantly, decisional conflict may arise from multiple sources, and there may be 
subgroups of survivors with greater or different types of decision support needs. Providing 
information and addressing misperceptions about fertility topics is an important first step for 
all survivors, regardless of medical factors. In this survey, 71% of those queried worried 
about their family health history affecting future children, independent of a hereditary cancer 
diagnosis. Young survivors also report reproductive concerns while concurrently 
acknowledging their oncologists’ reassurance otherwise.43 Periodic assessment of survivors’ 
level of understanding about reproductive health issues and the nature of their concerns will 
help guide clinical practice and potentially avoid or ameliorate fertility-related distress.

 Importantly, ovarian function should be monitored irrespective of survivors’ desire for future 
children as lack of estrogen resulting from ovarian failure may exacerbate other late effects 
of cancer treatment such as cardiotoxicity, bone health, and endocrine disorders.44
Limited evidence suggests decision aids and counseling improve patient decision-making 
about pre-treatment FP and reduce later regret.24,38 However, factors influencing post-
treatment FP decisions are different from pre-treatment decisions. Decision support needs 
may differ as women move beyond the emotional, physical, and financial aftermath of their 
cancer experience and fertility-related treatment effects are more fully realized.45,46 After 
treatment, survivors have more time to clarify their options, consider personal values and 
priorities, access support, and gather financial resources. Further work should determine the 
types of resources women need and the best approaches to provide those resources. While it 
is clear that information should be provided, additional efforts may help those who are 
highly distressed, anxious, or avoidant. A stepped care model of support may best address 
the varying levels of support needs by providing the opportunity for women to “step up” to 
increasingly supportive resources as needed (e.g., decision aid plus decision counselor).
It is also critical that reproductive health counseling be comprehensive. In addition to FP, 
support services should address alternative paths to achieving motherhood. We found that 
only a minority of the women (20%) who were unable to become pregnant or carry a 
pregnancy had preserved their fertility, despite 92% wanting future children. Forty-three 
percent reported unmet information needs regarding alternative family-building options such 
as adoption. Contraceptive use and counseling around safe sexual practices is equally 
important.47 Addressing issues related to dating and disclosure may also help survivors 
navigate interpersonal difficulties.33 Fertility topics affect a range of psychosocial concerns 
among young survivors and support services are sorely lacking.48
While the use of social media and web-based procedures have been recommended when 
conducting research with young adult cancer survivors,26,27 a number of limitations must be 
considered. Although screening items assessed eligibility, participant responses were not 
externally validated. Recruitment using young adult cancer advocacy groups’ social media 
outlets may have compromised the generalizability of the findings. Additionally, the cross-
sectional design precluded conclusions regarding causality. Analyses were driven by 
empirically-based decision-making research,34,49 but further work is needed to determine 
the directionality of relations. Longitudinal studies may identify changes in survivors’ 
decisional conflict and support needs as they age with shifting priorities and life goals. 
Despite these limitations, findings fill an important gap in the literature regarding young 
adult female survivors’ decision-making about FP after treatment. The relatively large 
sample size and geographic diversity of the sample are important study strengths.
Conclusions
These data underline the importance of addressing fertility issues in post-treatment 
survivorship care to ensure that women at risk for premature ovarian failure do not miss their 
narrowed window of reproductive opportunity. There is a critical need to develop resources 
for survivors and for clinicians to use to support patients in making informed, values-based

 decisions about their reproductive options. This should be done in parallel to research 
addressing other sources of survivors’ unmet needs and barriers to clinical implementation 
of interventions (e.g., providers’ lack of knowledge or prioritization of fertility). Research 
supporting the use of biomarkers such as anti-Müllerian hormone to predict post-treatment 
reproductive potential is also growing with great promise of improving patient counseling.50 
While patients will certainly benefit from more personalized information, this alone is not 
likely to eliminate decisional distress as women must still determine how their unique 
values, preferences, and circumstance weigh against the pros and cons of treatment 
options.34 Research prioritization strategies may be used to identify the relative value of 
targeting different approaches to improving patient outcomes, alone or in combination, and 
to ensure efficient use of research resources.51

 Figure 1. Unmet information needs about fertility topics is associated with greater decisional 
conflict about future fertility preservation
Participants who reported unmet information needs about fertility topics reported 
significantly higher levels of decisional conflict about future fertility preservation 
(independent samples t-tests; all p’s<.01). Mean levels of decisional conflict for subgroups 
with and without unmet information needs are depicted.

Table 3
Regression model predicting decisional conflict about future fertility preservation (n=179).1
Greater decisional conflict about future fertility preservation was associated with greater unmet information needs and, at a trend level, greater 
reproductive concerns. Unmet information needs and reproductive concerns accounted for 22% of the variance in decisional conflict.
