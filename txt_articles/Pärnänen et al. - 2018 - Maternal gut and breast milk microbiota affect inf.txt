The infant gut microbiota has a high abundance of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs)
compared to adults, even in the absence of antibiotic exposure. Here we study potential
sources of infant gut ARGs by performing metagenomic sequencing of breast milk, as well as
infant and maternal gut microbiomes. We find that fecal ARG and mobile genetic element
(MGE) profiles of infants are more similar to those of their own mothers than to those of
unrelated mothers. MGEs in mothers’ breast milk are also shared with their own infants.
Termination of breastfeeding and intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis of mothers, which have
the potential to affect microbial community composition, are associated with higher abun-
dances of specific ARGs, the composition of which is largely shaped by bacterial phylogeny in
the infant gut. Our results suggest that infants inherit the legacy of past antibiotic con-
sumption of their mothers via transmission of genes, but microbiota composition still strongly
impacts the overall resistance load.

 A
ntibiotic resistance is one of the main global threats to
public health1. Resistance to antibiotics is often conferred
on bacteria by antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), all of
which together form the antibiotic resistome2. Being colonized by
opportunistic pathogens carrying ARGs increases the risk of
acquiring infections that are difficult to treat3. The risk associated
with carrying resistant pathogens are especially large in infancy
when the gut microbiota and immune system are less stable and
developed compared to in adults4–6. Globally, an estimated
214,000 annual neonatal deaths are due to septic infections
caused by antibiotic resistant pathogens5 illustrating the drastic
effects of the antibiotic resistance crisis on infant health.
Recent research has revealed that the infant gut has a high
abundance of ARGs compared to adults even when infants have
not been exposed to antibiotics7–9. The high amounts of ARGs
carried by infants’ bacteria in the absence of antibiotic selection
pressure raise questions about their origin, since the selection
must have occurred prior entering the infant’s gut, for example
during antibiotic treatment of the infant’s mother. The high
abundance of Gammaproteobacteria in the infant gut has been
hypothesized to explain the higher levels of ARGs as Gamma-
proteobacteria often carry several resistance genes10 and encom-
pass taxa which are among the first colonizers of the gut7–9,11,12.
However, the origin of the resistant bacterial strains to the infant
gut is not known, as they can be transmitted from the environ-
ment, other individuals or the mother. Although similar ARG
profiles have been found in the guts of mothers and infants,
suggesting the possibility sharing of resistance genes12,13, previous
studies have reported that infants and their mothers do not have
significantly
more
similar
gut
resistomes
than
unrelated
individuals8,12. Breast milk—the primary source of nutrition
during the first months—shapes the infant gut microbiota14,15, but
its contribution to the resistome is virtually unexplored with the
exception of a study on preterm infants16. Moreover, mobile
genetic elements (MGEs), forming the mobilome, can transfer
ARGs between members of the gut microbial community17–19, but
their role in shaping the resistome in the infant gut is unclear.
In this study, we assessed whether mothers’ gut and breast milk
microbiota influence the infant gut resistome and MGEs during
the first 6 months of life by quantifying sharing of genes and
bacteria between mothers and infants. This was done using deep
metagenomic sequencing of 16 mother-infant pairs over a period
of 8 months, totaling in 96 breast milk or fecal samples of which
half overlapped by sampling time (Supplementary Data 1–3). Our
metagenomic characterization of the resistome and MGEs of
breast milk is the most deeply sequenced breast milk metagenome
to date20–22. Our results show that some of the mother’s ARGs
and MGEs are transferred to the infant gut from the mother’s gut
microbiota as well as breast milk. We also found that maternal
intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (IAP), breastfeeding duration
and bacterial phylogeny affect the resistome and MGE compo-
sition. Our study also demonstrates that breastfeeding reduces the
relative abundance of certain ARGs and MGEs in infants who are
breastfed for 6 months or longer compared to infants who are
breastfed for a shorter time. Correspondingly, IAP of mothers
increases the abundance of certain ARGs and MGEs in infants.
The results suggest that mothers contribute to the infant gut
microbiota’s resistome and mobilome development by sharing
genes from their gut and breast milk bacteria.
Results
Infant gut and breast milk have high levels of ARGs and MGEs.
Infant gut microbiomes had higher abundances of ARGs and
MGEs than the gut microbiomes of their mothers (p < 0.05,
negative binomial generalized linear models (GLMs) and Tukey’s
post hoc test) (Fig. 1c, d, Supplementary Tables 1&2). This was
apparent even though the infants had not been exposed to anti-
biotics during their life. However, the diversity of the MGEs and
ARGs did not significantly differ between the two groups despite
that the taxonomic diversity was significantly lower in infants
(p < 0.05, analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey’s post hoc
test, Fig. 1a, b and Supplementary Fig. 1, Supplementary
Tables 3–6). The observation that infants have higher ARG
abundances compared to adults has been made previously8, but
similar studies on the MGE abundance in the infant gut have not
been conducted.
The relative abundances of ARGs were similar in breast
milk and fecal samples from 6-month-old infants and mothers
(p > 0.05, negative binomial GLMs and Tukey’s post hoc test,
Fig. 1c and d, Supplementary Table 1). Breast milk had the lowest
microbial diversity of all sample types (p < 0.05, (ANOVA) and
Tukey’s post hoc test, Supplementary Fig. 1, Supplementary
Tables 3&4). MGEs were significantly more abundant in breast
milk than in mothers’ feces (p < 0.05, negative binomial GLMs
and Tukey’s post hoc test, Fig. 1b, Supplementary Table 2).
However, due to the lower sequencing depth in breast milk
compared to feces, there is uncertainty in the exact estimates of
both the relative abundance and diversity, which should be noted.
Principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) was done to cluster
samples
using
relative
abundance
(Fig.
2,
Supplementary
Tables 6&7) and presence–absence data (Supplementary Fig. 2,
Supplementary Tables 6&7) on the microbiomes, resistomes and
MGEs. Breast milk harbored a microbial community, resistome
and MGE profile distinct from the gut (ADONIS, Benjamini &
Hochberg
method
adjusted
p-value < 0.05,
Fig.
2a–d
and
Supplementary Fig. 2, Supplementary Tables 7&8). Breast milk
was overall more similar to the infant than maternal gut. We
observed that infants and mothers had differences not only in
their microbial community and resistome composition which
have been observed previously7,8, but also in their MGE
composition (ADONIS, Benjamini & Hochberg method adjusted
p-value < 0.05, Fig. 2a–d and Supplementary Fig. 2, Supplemen-
tary Table 7). Characterization of the MGEs was enabled by using
a custom MGE database (Materials and methods).
Differences in the resistome compositions between adults and
infants and gut and breast milk were also seen in ARG and MGE
classes (Fig. 3a, b). Tetracycline resistance genes were the most
abundant resistance class in mothers’ feces and also prevalent in
infants, which is typical for gut microbiota10,23,24. Interestingly,
all resistance gene classes except tetracycline, MLSB (macrolide-
lincosamide-streptogramin B) and trimethoprim resistance were
more abundant in infants compared to mothers (negative
binomial GLM, Tukey’s post hoc test, adjusted p-value < 0.05).
The colistin resistance gene class including the pmr and mobile
mcr gene families was among the 12 most abundant classes and
abundant especially in infants. Nonetheless, we did not detect any
mobile colistin resistance genes. Transposases constituted the
most common MGE class in all samples (Fig. 3). The higher
abundance of ARGs and MGEs including conjugative plasmids
and transposons in the infant gut (Figs. 1c, d and 3a, b) indicates
that there is a higher potential for antibiotic resistance and
horizontal gene transfer than in the adult gut.
Gammaproteobacteria and Bacilli were more common in
infants than in mothers while mothers had more Clostridia,
Bacteroides and Verrumicrobiae (Fig. 3d). On class level,
Actinobacteria was most abundant in fecal samples and Bacilli
in milk samples. The most abundant genus in feces of infants and
mothers was Bifidobacterium and genus Streptococcus in breast
milk (Fig. 3c). Genera which were significantly different (DESeq2,
negative binomial GLMs, Wald’s test, p < 0.05) between infants
and mothers and 1- and 6-month-old infants using DESeq225

Fig. 4.
Infant gut resistomes are linked to microbiome composition.
The microbial community composition structured the resistome
and MGE composition in the fecal microbiome of infants and
mothers and in breast milk. The resistome, MGE and microbial
community distance matrices correlated significantly with each
other (Mantel’s test, cor ≥ 0.5 and p ≤ 0.001 for all pairwise cor-
relations). The correlation between microbial community struc-
ture and ARGs suggests that the phylogenetic composition at least
partially governs the resistome and mobilome composition in the
gut microbiome of infants and mothers and in breast milk,
similar to what has been seen in soil habitats26. Interestingly,
there also seems to be an association between the microbial
community and MGEs. However, MGEs did not show correlation
patterns with any specific taxa on species, genus, and class levels
(Supplementary Data 4).
On the other hand, strong correlations between taxa, such as
Escherichia coli and Gammaproteobacteria, and the total sum of
ARG abundances were observed in the infants at both 1 and
6 months of age (negative binomial GLMs, Benjamini &
Hochberg
method
adjusted
p-value < 0.05,
Supplementary
Data 4). E. coli best predicted the ARG abundances in infants
(model validation with χ2-test p < 0.05, negative binomial GLM,
estimate = 0.062, p = 6.87e−07). This confirms the existing
hypothesis that Gammaproteobacteria contribute to high resis-
tance load in infants7,11 and most likely harbor the majority of
the most abundant ARGs. Infants had more Gammaproteobac-
teria, including E. coli, than the mothers (Fig. 3 and Supplemen-
tary
Fig.
1).
Gammaproteobacteria
and
Enterobacteriaceae
blooms have been linked to increased rates of horizontal gene
transfer
between
opportunistic
pathogens
and
commensals
during states of gut microbiota dysbiosis27, suggesting that there
might be elevated rates of gene transfer in the infant gut with high
abundances of Enterobacteriaceae. This could further promote
the spread of ARGs in the infant gut. However, breastfeeding
might be beneficial in reducing the ARG load, as breast milk has
been shown to decrease the abundance of Enterobacteriaceae and
E. coli in the infant gut28,29.
Despite the fact that breast milk had similar total relative
abundances of ARGs to fecal samples, the abundant taxa in breast
milk samples were negatively correlated with the total relative
ARG abundances in infants (negative binomial GLMs, Benjamini
& Hochberg method adjusted p-value < 0.05, Supplementary
Data 4). We observed that of all the genera, Bifidobacterium
had the strongest negative correlation with ARG abundance in
infants (Supplementary Data 4). Bifidobacterium was too rare to
detect in the breast milk samples using metagenomics. Previous
studies using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, which enables
more sensitive characterization of taxonomic information, have
reported that the abundance of Bifidobacterium in breast milk

oligosaccharides14 and it was the most dominant genus in the
infant gut (Fig. 3c). Our results indicate that colonization by
Bifidobacterium might be beneficial for reducing the resistance
gene load in the infant gut.
Infants’ ARGs and MGEs resemble those of their mothers.
Infants shared 40% of their ARG and 37% of their MGE types in
their guts with their mothers and correspondingly, 20 and 12%
with breast milk (Supplementary Fig. 5). Of the ARGs detected in
breast milk, 70 and 46% overlapped between infant and maternal
gut, respectively. It is likely that some of the genes shared between
breast milk and infant gut are directly transferred via breast-
feeding to the gut by shared species, as 76% of the species found
in breast milk were also detected in the infant gut. This indicates
that while several genes are common between mothers and
infants, some ARGs and MGEs might be acquired by the infant
from other maternal body sites such as the skin and mouth or
from the urogenital tract. Some of the bacteria are likely also
acquired from non-maternal sources as has been suggested
previously8.
The infant gut microbial community, resistome and MGE
compositions were significantly more similar to each infant’s own
mother’s gut microbiota than to unrelated women (ANOVA,
family, p < 0.05, Fig. 4a–f for microbiota, resistomes, and MGEs,
respectively). The results indicate similarity of microbial com-
munity composition, ARGs and MGEs between related mothers
and infants. Previous studies have not been able to pinpoint that
infants share significantly more ARGs with their mothers than
with unrelated adults possibly due to small set of subjects or
methodological challenges8,12. Our results suggest that maternal
ARGs and MGEs have significant effects on the resistome and
MGE composition of the infant gut and that there likely is
transfer of some of these genes between mothers and infants.
When we compared the infant gut to breast milk, we
observed that the infant gut MGE type and DNA sequence
profile compositions were more similar to those of each infant’s
own mother’s breast milk than to milk from unrelated mothers
(ANOVA, family, p < 0.05, Fig. 5e, f), indicating that MGEs are
shared between mothers and infants also via breast milk.
Correspondingly,
the
mothers’
breast
milk
MGE
DNA
sequence profiles were more similar to DNA profiles of the
mother’s own feces than to the fecal DNA profiles of other
mothers (ANOVA, individual, p < 0.05, Supplementary Fig. 6).
The similarities of MGEs in the gut and breast milk of related
mothers and infants (ANOVA, family, p < 0.05, Fig. 5e, f) and
breast milk and feces from the same mother (ANOVA,
individual, p < 0.05, Supplementary Fig. 6) were observed
despite the vastly different conditions in gut and breast milk.
Interestingly, the sharing of MGE types and nucleotide profiles
between gut and breast milk was not reflected in the taxonomic
compositions
and
resistomes
(ANOVA,
family,
p > 0.05,
Fig. 5a–d and individual, ANOVA, p > 0.05 Supplementary
Fig. 6d, e). However, this might be due to limitations in the
sequencing of breast milk microbial DNA resulting in a lower
sequencing depth, making it more difficult to observe sharing
of low-abundant species and genes.

 Overall, the infant microbial communities, resistomes and
MGEs on species and gene type level were more similar to other
infants than to those of their mothers (ANOVA, same type vs.
same family, p < 0.05, Fig. 4a, c, e). This is likely due to differences
in the gut environmental conditions between infants and their
mothers being reflected in the microbiome and, by consequence,
also the resistome, as it seems that phylogeny is a major
determinant of the gut resistome. However, on DNA sequence
profile level, the infant total microbial communities were
significantly more similar to their own mothers than to other
infants (ANOVA, same family vs. same type, p < 0.05, Fig. 4b).
This result suggests that the signature of microbial strains
transmitted from mothers is more pronounced than the signature
related to infancy or adulthood, despite there being differences in
the microbial community composition between infants and
mothers (ANOVA, type, p < 0.05, Fig. 4a, b).
We observed that there were no significant differences in the
similarity of infants and their mothers in their microbial
community, resistome or MGEs in relation to sampling time
overlap versus different sampling times (ANOVA, p > 0.05,
Supplementary Fig. 7) suggesting that the familial signature is
stable for several months. This might be the result of a constant
transmission between family members or due to stabilization of
strains and genes in the infant gut. Correspondingly, the infant
microbial community, resistome and MGE compositions were
significantly more similar to their own than to an infant of the
same age (ANOVA, p < 0.05, Supplementary Fig. 6) suggesting
that the signature of each infant is more pronounced than the
signature related to the infant’s age. The results indicate that the
transmission signature of each family or individual, which was
observed in the microbiomes, resistomes, and MGEs, is persistent.
Since half of the mothers received IAP antibiotics, we
investigated whether the antibiotics had an effect on how similar
the mothers’ and infants’ microbiomes, resistomes, and MGEs
were. We did not observe any differences in similarities between
related infants and mothers in microbial communities, ARGs,
and MGEs based on antibiotic treatment (Supplementary Fig. 8).
However, IAP group’s mothers and infants shared significantly
less species than the control group (ANOVA, p < 0.05, Supple-
mentary Fig. 8).
IAP and terminating breastfeeding increase ARGs and MGEs.
We studied the possible contribution of breastfeeding duration
and intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (IAP) on the development
of the infant gut microbiome, resistome, and MGEs. Termination

mended duration of exclusive breastfeeding according to the

 World Health Organization32, was associated with an enrichment
of several ARGs and MGEs in infants (negative binomial GLMs,
Wald’s test, DESeq2, adjusted p-value < 0.05, Fig. 6a, b), while no
significant differences in the taxonomic composition or total
relative sum abundance of ARGs and MGEs were detected. The
enriched genes included genes conferring resistance to ami-
noglycoside, sulphonamide, and tetracycline as well as integrases,
plasmid markers, and transposases (Fig. 6a, b, negative binomial
GLMs, Wald’s test, DESeq2, adjusted p-value < 0.05). The results
suggest that early termination of breastfeeding might have
negative health effects for infants due to an increased resistance
potential of the gut microbiota against certain antibiotics, and,
thus, increasing the likelihood of selecting for antibiotic resistant
opportunistic pathogens able to cause infections under the right
circumstances.
Antibiotic treatment of mothers during delivery (IAP) had a
modest but statistically significant effect on the composition of
the gut microbiota of 1-month-old infants (ADONIS, R2 = 0.13,
p = 0.048), but not on the resistome or MGE composition. The
abundance of horizontally transferrable ARGs and MGEs was
significantly increased in the IAP group compared to the control
group still 6 months after the antibiotic prophylaxis (negative
binomial GLMs, p = 5.34e−03 and p = 1.34e−03, respectively).
No significant changes were observed in the abundance of ARGs
in the infants between the IAP and control groups or in the
abundance and composition of the microbiome, ARGs and MGEs
in probiotic and placebo groups. Infants in the IAP group also
had a larger number of enriched ARGs and MGEs than infants in
the control group (negative binomial GLMs, Wald’s test, DESeq2,
adjusted p-value < 0.05, Fig. 6c–f). The effect of IAP on the infants

 persisted for 6 months, even though no significant trends for
increase in the ARG or MGE loads were observed in the mothers.
Sharing of strains and MGEs containing ARGs. The presence of
MGEs carrying ARGs shared among mother-infant pairs was
investigated. All together 86 contigs containing an ARG and an
MGE were assembled from the samples (Supplementary Data 5).
Of those contigs, 26 contigs with the same arrangement of genes
in the contigs were shared between a related mother-infant pair
the most common contig being the Tn916 transposon with a tetM
resistance gene. This suggests that the MGEs containing ARGs
are shared between family members. Nearly all of the mobile
ARG contig types were found in more than one infant-mother
pair, indicating that the MGE types which could be assembled
from the dataset are common in the gut and that the identified
types are widely spread. However, the analysis was done based on
gene annotations only, and cannot distinguish between nucleotide
level variants of the genetic elements due to the technical chal-
lenge of short read assembly of low abundance genes in varying
genetic contexts, such as ARGs from diverse environments33–35.
We studied whether mothers and infants shared strains of the

between the guts of infants and their mothers and the sharing was
observed only in one mother-infant pair. This suggests that
infants do not generally acquire the E. coli strains from their
mother or that the maternal strains come from other body sites.
The investigation of contigs revealed that several of the assembled
mobile ARG containing contigs had their best taxonomic hit to
Escherichia or Klebsiella (Supplementary Data 5), indicating that
many ARGs carried by E. coli in the infant gut are mobile. It has

 been previously observed that Enterobacteriaceae in infants born
in hospitals are likely to be acquired from the hospital
environment22,36, which might partly explain the observed
correlation of E. coli with high ARG abundance in the infant gut.
Discussion
Our study provides insight into the assembly of the infant
resistome and MGEs during the first 6 months of life. Infants
shared gut resistomes and MGEs with their own mother’s gut and
breast milk microbiota. Infants had higher relative abundances of
both ARGs and MGEs than adults. The high abundance of MGEs
may cause health risks as it is likely that resistance genes asso-
ciated with MGEs are more likely to be transferred from com-
mensal bacteria to pathogens37. This inherent dynamic nature of
the mobilome was also observed in our study as the mobilome
structure was not correlated with individual taxa and was shared
between mother-infant pairs in both breast milk and feces despite
the vast differences in their microbiota composition. The
observed increased similarity of the resistance genes and the
MGEs between infants and their mothers compared to unrelated
mothers can partly explain why infants have high resistance gene
loads before having antibiotic treatment as the history of anti-
biotic use or acquired antibiotic resistant strains of the mother
could have an effect on the developing infant gut resistome
through transfer of resistant bacteria. However, it seems that
some of the resistance genes could be transferred from other
maternal body sites besides gut or breast milk or from non-
maternal sources, which we did not investigate. Intrapartum
antibiotic prophylaxis of mothers was linked to enrichment of
resistance genes and mobile genetic elements in the infant gut still
6 months after the treatment, showing that antibiotic consump-
tion of mothers can potentially have significant and persistent
effects on the infant resistome and mobilome at least when the
antibiotic has been administered intravenously during delivery.
Some of the effects of IAP might also be passed on to infants by
transmission of strains from other maternal sources. For example,
the initial largescale colonization of the infant gut begins during
labor, and thus, changes in the vaginal microbiota could have a
significant impact on the gut microbiota of infants.
The infant gut resistomes were strongly shaped by phylogeny
with E. coli and Gammaproteobacteria being highly positively and
Bifidobacterium negatively correlated with resistance load. We
observed enrichment of resistance and MGE-associated genes in
infants who were breastfed for less than 6 months despite that
breast milk, like skin38, had high relative abundances of resistance
genes. Our results indicate that breastfeeding for at least
6 months, which is known to have many health benefits32, reduce
the abundance of Gammaproteobacteria and conversely increase

 the abundance of Bifidobacteria14, could thus also be promoted
for the reason that it potentially reduces the antibiotic resistance
gene load in the infant gut. Based on our study and previous
work8,11 it seems that infants inherit the legacy of past antibiotic
use, as they carry high loads of antibiotic resistant bacteria
acquired from their mothers and the environment even prior to
being exposed to antibiotics themselves. However, since phylo-
geny was the major determinant of the resistome and most ARGs
seemed to be carried by a limited number of taxa in the infant gut,
actions that shape the overall microbiota composition of the
infant gut, such as breastfeeding or antibiotics, likely have a
strong impact on the resistance gene load in infancy.
Methods
Study subjects and sample collection. The 16 mother-infant pairs in this study
were selected from 241 pairs participating in a parallel, double-blind placebo-
controlled trial on the effects of probiotics in the development of eczema39. The
study was found ethically acceptable by the Hospital District of Southwest Finland
Ethical committee and informed consent was obtained from the families partici-
pating in the study. Only infants born vaginally at full term (gestational age
≥37 weeks) and their mothers were included in this study. Availability of fecal
samples served as an additional criterion for inclusion. Infants exposed to antibiotic
treatment during the neonatal period or the first 6 months of life were excluded
from the study. Intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (IAP) was administered to eight
mothers due to positive group B Streptococcus test (n = 6) or premature rupture of
membranes (n = 2). The antibiotics used were penicillin G (n = 7) or Cephalothin
(n = 1). Ten of the 16 mothers received probiotic supplements containing either
Bifidobacterium longum BB536 and Lactobacillus paracasei ST11 or Lactobacillus
rhamnosus LGG 2 months before and after delivery. Data on the duration of total
breastfeeding was collected. Metadata of the infants and mothers is provided in
Supplementary Data 1.
Fecal samples were obtained from the mothers at 32 weeks of gestation and
1-month postpartum and from the infants at the ages of 1 and 6 months. The fecal
samples were collected at home and refrigerated immediately for up to 24 h after
which they were frozen and stored in −80 °C until DNA extraction. Colostrum
samples were collected during the first week postpartum and breast milk samples
1 month after delivery. Before sample collection, the breast was cleaned with soap
and water, and breast milk was collected manually, discarding the first drops, with a
sterile milk collection unit. Mothers were given written instructions for standardized
collection of samples and the samples were frozen and stored at −20 °C at home
and subsequently at −80 °C at the laboratory until DNA extraction.
DNA extraction and sequencing. DNA was extracted from fecal and milk samples
using King Fisher (ThermoFisher) and InviMag® Stool DNA Kit (Stratec). Stool
samples with visible coloration after DNA extraction were purified using DNeasy
PowerClean Pro CleanUp Kit (Qiagen). DNA concentrations were measured using
Qubit (ThermoFisher) with the Qubit dsDNA HS Assay Kit (ThermoFisher). DNA
purity was determined with Nanodrop (ThermoFisher) by measuring 260/280 and
260/230 absorbance ratios. Sequencing libraries were made with Nextera XT DNA
Library Preparation Kit (Illumina) according to manufacturer’s instructions.
Paired-end sequencing was done using NextSeq 500 (Illumina).
Metagenomic analysis. FastQC40 was used to analyse the quality of the meta-
genomic reads. Read lengths were 170 and 132 bp for the forward and reverse
reads, respectively (Supplementary Data 2 and 3). Mean PHRED of the score was
35. No quality trimming prior to further analysis was done as the quality of the
reads was high.
Host DNA was removed using paired-end mapping with Bowtie241 version
2.3.3 against a human reference genome GRCh38.p9 GCF_000001405.35 and
unmapped paired-end reads were filtered using SAMtools42,43 version 1.4 with
parameters view -b -f 12 -F 256. BEDTools44 version 2.26.0 was used to convert the
bam files to fastq files containing the non-human paired-end reads. Adapters were
removed from the non-human reads with cutadapt45 version 1.10 with default
parameters. Mean sequencing depth of the non-human DNA was 1.9 Gbp for fecal
samples (Supplementary Data 2) and 160 Mbp for milk samples (Supplementary
Data 3). Host DNA content in the breast milk samples varied between 78 and 96%.
Species level community profiling based on marker genes was done using
Metaphlan246 version 2.6.0 by running the metaphlan2.py command with the—
input_type fastq—nproc 5 options. Merged abundance table was created using the
Metaphlan2 utils script. The merged abundance table was edited to only include
taxa which were identified to species level. Additional community profiling was
done using Metaxa247 version 2.1 for 16S rRNA read extraction in paired-end
mode. The 16S rRNA sequence reads were classified using mothur’s48 (version
1.39.5) classify.seqs command with SILVA49 v. 123 as the reference database, with
the cutoff = 60, probs = F and processors = 8 parameters. A custom Unix script
was used to create an OTU table based on the classifications. Strain-level profiling
and strain tracking analysis as done using Strainphlan50 and the extract_markers.
py command to extract markers for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and all
Streptococcus and Staphylococcus species. The strainphlan.py command with—
relaxed_parameters2 option was used to create taxonomic trees of the strains in all
samples.
Resistome and mobilome were characterized by mapping metagenomic reads to
a comprehensive non-redundant database of more than 2700 mobile genetic
element and 3100 antibiotic resistance genes including Comprehensive Antibiotic
Resistance Database protein homolog model version 1.1.2 (CARD)51 and
ResFinder version 2.152. Some analyses were performed with only the Resfinder
database, which has only acquired or mobile ARGs. A custom MGE database was
created by fetching CDS for genes that were annotated as IS*, ISCR*, intI1, int2,
istA*, istB*, qacEdelta, tniA*, tniB*, tnpA*, or Tn916 transposon ORFs or genes in
the NCBI53 nucleotide database and PlasmidFinder database54. Redundancy in the
databases was removed with VSEARCH55 -usearch_global command with—id 99
option. In total, the MGE database consists of genes with 278 different gene name
annotations and more than 2000 unique sequences excluding the sequences from
PlasmidFinder database. The custom MGE database is available from https://
github.com/KatariinaParnanen/MobileGeneticElementDatabase.
Bowtie241 mapping was done with options -D 20 -R 3 -N 1 -L 20 -i S,1,0.50 and
was used to map reads the ARG and MGE databases. SAMtools42,43 was used to
filter and count reads and if both reads mapped to the same gene the read was
counted as one match and if the reads mapped to different genes, both were
counted as hits to the respective gene.
DNA sequence profiles based on kmers were produced from the metagenomic
reads using sourmash56 with option -kmer 31. Subsets of reads mapping to ARGs
and MGEs were used to produce the profiles for ARGs and MGEs.
Preliminary data processing for statistical analysis. Statistical analysis was done
in R57 version 3.4.1. Metaphlan244, Metaxa245 and ARG and MGE mapping
results, taxonomy and annotation tables and metadata files were compiled into
individual data objects in phyloseq58 version 1.20.0. All custom R codes are
available in Supplementary Software file. The ARG and MGE Bowtie2 counts were
normalized to the length of the respective gene. The length-normalized numbers
were then further normalized to the number of bacterial 16S rRNA gene reads
divided by the length of the 16S rRNA gene. The 16S rRNA gene was chosen for
normalization instead of library size to account for variation in non-bacterial DNA
content in the samples. The normalized values were used in all the following
analyses. All figures if not indicated otherwise were drawn with ggplot259
version 2.2.1.
Ordination analysis. Principal coordinate analyses of the taxonomic profiles ARGs
and MGEs was done on presence–absence and relative abundance data using
cmdscale command in R. Distances between samples were calculated using Horn-
Morisita60 similarity index obtained with the vegdist command from vegan
package61 version 2.4–3. Permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PER-
MANOVA) between different groups was done with adonis in vegan61 with
similarity index using 9999 permutations and the resulting p-values were corrected
with Benjamini & Hochberg procedure for multiple testing using the p.adjust
command in R.
Differences in diversities and abundances of ARGs and MGEs. Shannon and
Simpson diversities and Chao1 estimate of richness of the taxonomic profiles,
ARGs and MGEs were calculated using vegan61. Statistical significances of the
differences between the diversities in sample types (infant 1 M, infant 6 M, mother
32 GW, mother 1 M, colostrum, and breast milk 1 M) and in IAP versus control,
breastfeeding until 6 months and breastfeeding for less than 6 months were cal-
culated using analysis of variance (ANOVA) and the resulting p-values were
corrected using Tukey’s post hoc test62,63 in base R.
Statistical significances of differences in ARG and MGE total sum relative
abundances normalized to total 16S rRNA gene counts and length were calculated
using negative binomial generalized linear models (GLMs) in the MASS package64
version 7.3–47 and corrected using Tukey’s post hoc test62,63. Negative binomial
GLMs were used since the distribution of ARGs and MGEs did not fit normal or
Poisson distribution due to overdispersion.
Analysis of differential abundances of ARGs, MGEs, and taxa. Analysis of
which genes’ relative abundances differ due to breastfeeding duration and IAP, as
well as taxa which change between 1- and 6-month-old infants and infants and
mothers was done using DESeq225 version 1.16.1 to obtain fold changes and sta-
tistical significances of the observed changes. Before analysis with DESeq225, gene
counts were normalized to total 16S rRNA gene counts and gene lengths and then
multiplied by 1e5 (5.6 times the mean 16S rRNA read count) and rounded to
integers resulting in normalized values which take into account variation in the 16S
rRNA gene counts in different samples. Pseudo-count of plus one was added to all
values, so that zero values were changed to one, which enables comparisons
between not detected and detected values (6.6 versus 1 for a detected gene versus
not detected). Several different values for detected genes were used ranging from
210 and similar results were obtained in the different iterations showing that the

 analysis was robust regardless of the selected values for normalization. A sig-
nificance cutoff for the adjusted p-value of 0.05 was used in the analysis.
Mantel’s test and correlation of taxa with ARG and MGE abundances. Species,
ARG and MGE distance matrixes were calculated using Horn-Morisita similarity
index60 with vegdist command in vegan package61 and compared to observe if
there were correlations between taxonomy and the resistome and mobilome.
Comparisons were done using Mantel’s test from vegan61 and Pearson pair-wise
correlations obtained using rcorr command from the Hmisc65 package version
4.0–3.
Negative binomial GLMs from the MASS package64 were used to find taxa on
class, genus, and species level which correlated with the ARG and MGE total sum
abundances. All the taxa on the investigated taxonomic levels were correlated with
the ARG or MGE total sum abundance in the different sample types (1- and 6-
month-old infants and pregnant and 1 month postpartum mothers). The p-values
were corrected using p.adjust command with Benjamini & Hochberg method. After
finding candidate taxa, model selection was done using ANOVA and χ2-tests in
base R with a significance cutoff of 0.05.
Venn diagrams. The number of present and shared species or gene types were
calculated for the compared sample types and Venn diagrams were drawn in R
using the VennDiagram package66 using draw.pairwise.venn command.
Similarity of gene and taxa profiles between mothers and infants. Vegan
package61 and Jaccard dissimilarity indices using presence–absence data were used
to calculate distance matrixes for mothers 1 month postpartum and 1-month-old
infants, and infants at 1 and 6 months of age to determine whether the micro-
biomes, resistomes, and mobilomes were more similar within samples collected
from the same family or from the same infant at different times. Similar analysis
was also done using DNA sequence profiles of the total microbial community,
ARGs and MGEs to obtain nucleotide level comparisons between samples based on
kmer frequencies of the metagenomic reads (all non-human reads and reads
mapping to ARGs and MGEs, respectively). The DNA sequence profiles provide
means to compare the signatures samples to each other on a kmer level inde-
pendently of database-based annotations. Kmer frequency signatures were pro-
duced using sourmash56 with kmer size 31. For species comparisons the data was
square root transformed. Results were presented with density plots produced using
ggplot259. Statistical analysis of the significances of observed differences was done
by linear modeling with lm function in base R (see function lmp in Supplementary
Software file). Permutations of how often a smaller p-value was achieved with
randomized data as opposed to the assigned two groups compared was used to
calculate the corrected p-value. 9999 permutations were used for the analysis. The
effect of IAP on the frequency of sharing taxa or ARGs and MGEs was done in a
similar manner as described above, but the distances were calculated between
related mother-infant pairs in IAP and control groups and the effect of IAP was
determined on based whether there was a significant difference in similarities due
to the antibiotic treatment. Related mother-infant pairs were analyzed in a similar
fashion, but the distances were calculated between samples which were taken at the
same time (1 month time point) or at different times (antepartum maternal
samples compared to infants at 1 and 6 months as well as 1 month postpartum
maternal sample compared to 6-month-old infants).
