ABSTRACT
The APOL1 high-risk genotype, present in approximately 13% of blacks in the United States, is a risk factor
for kidney function decline in populations with CKD. It is unknown whether genetic screening is indicated
in the general population. We evaluated the prognosis of APOL1 high-risk status in participants in the
population-based Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study, including associations with eGFR
decline, variability in eGFR decline, and related adverse health events (AKI, ESRD, hypertension, diabetes,
cardiovascular disease, pre-ESRD and total hospitalization rate, and mortality). Among 15,140 ARIC par-
ticipants followed from 1987–1989 (baseline) to 2011–2013, 75.3% were white, 21.5% were black/APOL1
low-risk, and 3.2% were black/APOL1 high-risk. In a demographic-adjusted analysis, blacks had a higher
risk for all assessed adverse health events; however, in analyses adjusted for comorbid conditions and
socioeconomic status, blacks had a higher risk for hypertension, diabetes, and ESRD only. Among blacks,
the APOL1 high-risk genotype associated only with higher risk of ESRD in a fully adjusted analysis. Black
race and APOL1 high-risk status were associated with faster eGFR decline (P,0.001 for each). However,
we detected substantial overlap among the groups: median (10th–90th percentile) unadjusted eGFR de-
cline was 1.5 (1.0–2.2) ml/min per 1.73 m2 per year for whites, 2.1 (1.4–3.1) ml/min per 1.73 m2 per year
for blacks with APOL1 low-risk status, and 2.3 (1.5–3.5) ml/min per 1.73 m2 per year for blacks with
APOL1 high-risk status. The high variability in eGFR decline among blacks with and without the APOL1
high-risk genotype suggests that population-based screening is not yet justified.

In the United States, blacks have a significantly higher
risk of advanced CKD than whites.1–3 At least some of
the increased risk is explained by genetic factors: two
copies of the APOL1 risk alleles, present in 13% of
blacks but ,1% of whites, confer 1.7–2-times higher
risk of CKD progression and up to 30-fold higher risk
for specific etiologies of ESRD.4–7 However, not all
persons with the high-risk APOL1 genotype develop
kidney disease.8 The variation in kidney function de-
cline associated with APOL1 risk status has not been
well characterized, particularly in the general popula-
tion, nor has the risk of potentially mediating events,
suchasnewhypertension,diabetes,cardiovasculardis-
ease, and intervening hospitalizations.
In light of the strong association between APOL1
high-risk status and ESRD, recent discussion has fo-
cused on optimal screening strategies, with some ex-
perts recommending screening for APOL1 risk alleles
in specific populations, such as potential kidney do-
nors.9–11 However, much of the evidence supporting

 such a program is derived from studies of populations with CKD.6
Patterns of eGFR decline may differ between general and CKD
populations. A “second hit” may be needed to induce kidney
function decline in those with an APOL1 high-risk geno-
type,8,12,13 and persons with APOL1 high-risk status in a CKD
populationmayhavealreadyexperiencedthenecessary instigating
event. Long-term follow-up of APOL1 high-risk individuals in the
general population is necessary to determine the naturalhistoryof
kidney disease, as well as other meaningful adverse health events
associated with APOL1 genetic risk variants.
Using the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC)
study, a prospective cohort of 15,792 individuals followed at
five study visits over 25 years, we sought to determine the nat-
ural history of APOL1 high-risk status with respect to eGFR
decline. To fullycharacterizeprognosisandevaluate for potential
etiologies underlying differences in kidney function, we also
quantified the incidence of new-onset hypertension, diabetes,
cardiovascular disease, AKI, hospitalizations, ESRD, and all-
cause mortality by race and APOL1 high-risk status.
RESULTS
Baseline Characteristics, by Race–APOL1 Risk Status
There were 15,140 participants included: 75.7% were white,
21.2% black APOL1 low-risk, and 3.1% black APOL1 high-
risk (Table 1). Compared with whites, blacks of both APOL1
risk groups were slightly younger, more often female, with a
higher average body mass index, and higher prevalence of
hypertension and diabetes. Interestingly, blacks had both
higher average eGFR and a higher proportion with
eGFR,60 ml/min per 1.73 m2 at baseline compared with
whites. Blacks of both APOL1 risk groups had higher HDL
cholesterol, lower triglycerides, and a lower prevalence of as-
pirin use than whites. Annual family income and education
level were also significantly lower in both black APOL1 risk
groups. There were no statistically significant differences
in characteristics between blacks by APOL1 risk group at
visit 1 (age 45–65 years).
Incident Events, by Race–APOL1 Risk Status
Over a median follow-up of 22.6 years, blacks in both the
APOL1 low- and high-risk groups had a higher risk of total
and pre-ESRD hospitalizations, AKI, ESRD, hypertension,
diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and all-cause mortality com-
pared with white participants in both crude and demographic-
adjusted analyses (Table 2). For example, total hospitalization
rates were 1.82 (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.81 to 1.84),
2.09 (95% CI, 2.05 to 2.13), and 2.17 (95% CI, 2.07 to 2.26) per
10 person-years in the white, black APOL1 low-risk, and black
APOL1 high-risk groups, respectively. These differences persis-
ted after adjustment for age and sex, but not after adjustment for
multiple comorbid conditions and socioeconomic status. In the
fully adjusted analyses, blacks had higher risk of incident hyper-
tension, diabetes, and ESRD, but lower risk of total hospitaliza-
tions and incident cardiovascular disease. Among blacks, only
ESRD risk was higher among the APOL1 high-risk group com-
pared with the APOL1 low-risk group in fully adjusted analysis.

CLINICAL EPIDEMIOLOGY
 Annual eGFR Decline, by Race–APOL1 Risk Status
Blacks in both APOL1 risk groups had higher baseline eGFR, but
faster eGFR decline than whites (Figure 1). In demographic-
adjusted analysis, the average rate of eGFR decline was 1.5 ml/min
per 1.73 m2 per year for whites, 2.1 ml/min per 1.73 m2 per
year for blacks of APOL1 low-risk status, and 2.4 ml/min per
1.73 m2 per year for blacks of APOL1 high-risk status. In fully
adjusted analysis, results were similar, with the mean annual de-
cline in eGFR estimated as 1.3 ml/min per 1.73 m2 for whites,
1.7 ml/min per 1.73 m2 for blacks with APOL1 low-risk status,
and 1.9 ml/min per 1.73 m2 for blacks with APOL1 high-risk
status (P,0.001 for each comparison).
Variation in eGFR Decline, by Race–APOL1 Risk Status
The distribution of eGFR slopes varied substantially across and
within race–APOL1 risk status (Figure 2A). The median (10th–90th
percentile) annual unadjusted decline was 1.5 (1.0–2.2) ml/min
per 1.73 m2 for whites, 2.1 (1.4–3.1) ml/min per 1.73 m2 for

 blacks with APOL1 low-risk status, and 2.3 (1.5–3.5) ml/min per
1.73 m2 for blacks with APOL1 high-risk status. After taking into
account differences in distributions of other risk factors such as
diabetes and hypertension, differences in the adjusted annual
eGFR decline remained pronounced. A greater proportion of
blacks of APOL1 high-risk status had rapid eGFR decline
(.3 ml/min per 1.73 m2 per year) than whites and blacks of
APOL1 low-risk status (Figure 2B). Within the subgroup of pa-
tients with albuminuria .30 mg/g at study visit 4, the unad-
justed median (10th–90th percentile) decline in eGFR over the

4.1) ml/min per 1.73 m2 per year for blacks with APOL1
high-risk status.
Sensitivity Analyses
Associations between race–APOL1 status and eGFR decline
were similar to the main results in various sensitivity analyses.
When incident hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease,
and AKI were accounted for, the annual decline in eGFR was
1.4 ml/min per 1.73 m2 for whites, 1.9 ml/min per 1.73 m2
for blacks with APOL1 low-risk status, and 2.1 ml/min per
1.73 m2 for blacks with APOL1 high-risk status. When eGFR
abstracted from cardiovascular hospitalizations was included,
the annual decline in eGFR was 1.5 ml/min per 1.73 m2 for
whites, 2.0 ml/min per 1.73 m2 for blacks with APOL1 low-
risk status, and 2.2 ml/min per 1.73 m2 for blacks with APOL1
high-risk status. In sensitivity analyses without imputation of
eGFR at ESRD onset, differences persisted with slightly attenuated
results: the annual decline in eGFR was 1.4 ml/min per 1.73 m2
for whites, 1.7 ml/min per 1.73 m2 for blacks with APOL1 low-
risk status, and 2.0 ml/min per 1.73 m2 for blacks with APOL1
high-risk status. On the other hand, the addition of APOL1 risk
status to a multivariable model did not improve model discrim-
ination. When APOL1 risk status was added to the fully adjusted
multivariable model of ESRD risk that included race, there was no
statisticallysignificantimprovementin Cstatistic (C statisticwith-
out APOL1 risk status, 0.862; C statistic with APOL1 risk status,
0.868; P value fordifference=0.14). The slope difference for blacks
compared with whites in a model without APOL1 risk status was
–0.41 ml/min per 1.73 m2 per year; in a model with APOL1
status, the difference between the APOL1 low-risk group and
whites was –0.39 ml/min per 1.73 m2.
DISCUSSION
In this general population cohort of 15,140 middle-aged
individuals followed for over 20 years, blacks were at higher
risk for a broad range of adverse health outcomes compared
with whites. These racial disparities were only minimally ex-
plained by the APOL1 high-risk genotype, which was a risk
factor only for kidney function decline and incident ESRD.
There was substantially heterogeneity in kidney function de-
cline within each of the three race/APOL1 risk groups, sug-
gesting caution in individual predictions based on genotype.
Given the variability in kidney function decline among per-
sons with the APOL1 high-risk genotype, widespread screen-
ing of the black general population seems not yet justified.
The results of this general population study extend earlier
work examining eGFR trajectories in CKD cohorts.6,14 Similar
to results in the Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort (CRIC)
and African American Study of Kidney Disease and Hyperten-
sion, we found that blacks with two high-risk variants of the
APOL1 gene had higher risk of ESRD and a faster decline in
eGFR compared with whites (adjusted slope difference in
CRIC: –0.81 ml/min per 1.73 m2 per year in blacks with
APOL1 high-risk compared with whites; slope difference in
ARIC: –0.77 ml/min per 1.73 m2 per year). Like our study,
variability in eGFR decline was high in CRIC, where the SD of
unadjusted eGFR decline ranged from 3.1 to 5.6 ml/min per
1.73 m2 per year in subgroups of race/APOL1 risk and diabe-
tes status. Although CRIC results demonstrated faster declines
in eGFR among blacks without the APOL1 high-risk genotype
than whites in unadjusted analyses, this difference did not
persist in analyses adjusted for potential confounders. In con-
trast, we found that blacks of APOL1 low-risk status had faster
declines in eGFR than whites in all analyses. These differences
may be due to differences in length of follow-up: CRIC par-
ticipants were followed for a mean of 4.4 years, whereas ARIC
participants had up to 25 years of follow-up. Alternatively,
ethnic differences in disease progression may be less pro-
nounced among populations with prevalent CKD.
Our results also complement a recent publication from
the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults
(CARDIA) study.15 In a sample of 3030 adults with mean
baseline age of 35 years and 9 years of follow-up, both APOL1
Figure 1. Median, 10th, and 90th percentile eGFR decline from
mean baseline eGFR over 25 years varied by race/APOL1 status.
Slopes were estimated from a mixed model with the following co-
variates: age, sex, baseline coronary heart disease, body mass index,
HDL cholesterol, diabetes, systolic BP, smoking, family income, and
education level, and interaction terms of each covariate with time.

 high- and low-risk blacks were at higher risk than whites for
the development of incident albuminuria and eGFR decline in
demographic-adjusted analyses. In fully adjusted analyses, how-
ever, only the APOL1 high-risk group remained at statistically
significant higher risk. Differences in our results may be due to
thedifferentfollow-uptime betweenstudies. Otherexplanations
include differences in estimating equations, since CARDIA used
eGFR based on cystatin C levels rather than creatinine, differ-
ences inadjustmentvariables (including albuminuria, whichwas
not available at the baseline visit of the ARIC study), or differ-
ences in age of the cohort, since CARDIA participants were on
average 20 years younger at baseline. Given that most incident
CKD occurs after the age of 50 years,1 there were likely fewer
CKD events in the CARDIA cohort, thereby limiting power. On
the other hand, the ARIC cohort may inadvertently select for
more stable disease by not capturing persons who developed
ESRD prior to middle age. This type of selection bias would be
expected to result in underestimation of the differences between
blacks and whites, since blacks tend to develop kidney disease at
younger age than whites.16
Regardless of APOL1 genotype, blacks were at higher risk
for each adverse health event evaluated in this study. These
results are consistent with previous publications demonstrat-
ing pervasive health disparities among the United States pop-
ulation.17–19 Risks of adverse outcomes associated with black
race were attenuated in fully adjusted analyses, suggesting that
the poor outcomes are explained in part by differences at base-
line, including lower income and education levels, which may
be proxies for access to and quality of care. Blacks with APOL1
high-risk status were at higher risk of ESRD; surprisingly, they
were also at higher risk of incident diabetes and had a higher
rate of hospitalizations than blacks without the APOL1 high-
risk genotype. The latter two risks have not previously been
described and may be a byproduct of the higher kidney disease
risk. Indeed, there was no difference in hospitalization rates by
APOL1 genotype when only pre-ESRD hospitalizations were
included. Similarly, a diagnosis of incident diabetes requires
contact with the medical system, which is frequent among
persons with ESRD or advanced CKD. Notably, the association
between APOL1 risk status, incident diabetes, and hospitali-
zations was not statistically significant in fully adjusted anal-
yses, suggesting that the distribution of risk factors varied by
APOL1 risk status, likely by chance.
The mechanism by which APOL1 high-risk variants might
affect kidney disease progression remains uncertain. APOL1 is
upregulated in response to proinflammatory cytokines and
encodes the circulating protein apolipoprotein 1.20 Apolipo-
protein 1 is involved in the innate immune response, most
notably to Trypansoma brucei infection, where it causes
osmotic lysis of the parasite.5,21 The G1 and G2 variants
are mutations that appear to prevent neutralization of
apolipoprotein 1, a defense mechanism which has evolved
in Trypansoma brucei rhodesiense.22 Whether G1-/G2-encoded
apolipoprotein 1 has additional nephrotoxic action is not
known. There is some evidence that active infection or inflam-
mation may modify APOL1-related risk: in one study of
HIV-infected individuals, eGFR trajectory differed by APOL1
high-risk status only among those with unsuppressed vire-
mia.23 In another, associations between hemostatic factors and
ESRD were strongest in those with the APOL1 high-risk geno-
type compared with whites or blacks with the APOL1 low-risk
genotype.24
A novel aspect of this study is the examination of the
distribution of eGFR trajectories. Similar to studies in pop-
ulations with CKD and HIV,6,23 we observed that, on average,
blacks with the APOL1 high-risk genotype experienced faster
decline in eGFR. However, much of the difference was driven
by the tail of the distribution, or the few individuals with
extremely rapid decline in eGFR. In contrast, the majority of
individuals with APOL1 high-risk status had eGFR declines
similar to other race–APOL1 groups. This variability suggests
Figure 2. Distribution of average yearly eGFR slopes varied by race/
APOL1 status. eGFR was imputed as 15 ml/min per 1.73 m2 at the
time of ESRD onset. (A) reflects the unadjusted slope distribution, (B)
reflects the adjusted slope distribution with slopes estimated from a
mixed model with the following additional covariates: age, sex,
baseline coronary heart disease, body mass index, HDL cholesterol,
diabetes, systolic BP, smoking, family income, and education level,
and incorporating interaction terms of each covariate with time.

 that using the APOL1 genotype alone or with the currently
known risk factors to forecast future kidney disease would be
difficult. It also suggests that APOL1-associated susceptibility
may be in part modifiable. Identifying factors associated with
rapid eGFR decline among APOL1 high-risk individuals may
help to uncover genetic or environmental second hits, which
can compound APOL1-related renal risk.
The interplay of apolipoprotein 1 with the inflammatory
and innate immune system has led some to hypothesize that
APOL1 high-risk status might promote both CKD and cardio-
vascular disease. In this study, we found no difference in
cardiovascular disease risk by APOL1 genotype. The lack of
association is consistent with findings from the Systolic Blood
Pressure Intervention trial, where APOL1 high-risk status was
not associated with clinical cardiovascular disease.25 In
contrast, a combined study of the Jackson Heart Study and
the Women’s Health Initiative found an association between
APOL1 high-risk status and cardiovascular disease incidence,
defined as myocardial infarction, stroke, or therapeutic vascu-
lar interventions.26 Interestingly, APOL1 high-risk status was
associated with lower coronary calcium scores, when higher
scores are a strong predictor of cardiovascular risk.27,28 Dif-
ferences in these results may be due to differences in the se-
lection criteria for each of the studies, outcomes assessed, or
the length of follow-up, but suggest caution in genetic coun-
seling given the likely variability in APOL1 high-risk genotype
expression and/or penetrance.
There are notable strengths and limitations of this study. The
ARIC cohort is a general population-based study with long-term
follow-up of .15,000 individuals. Study visits were conducted
with careful attention to research protocol. Creatinine measure-
ments were standardized and calibrated over time to reduce the
possibility of bias from laboratory drift, a major concern in lon-
gitudinal studies evaluating change in biomarkers.29 Blacks were
directly genotyped for APOL1. Although whites were not geno-
typed, previous population-based studies have demonstrated a
very low rate of homozygous status among populations of Euro-
pean descent.7 Participants were followed not only at study visits,
but also by active surveillance of hospitalizations and linkage to
the US Renal Data System ESRD registry, a process that helps
alleviate concerns of differential loss to follow-up. Sensitivity anal-
yses were performed using eGFR abstracted from hospitalizations
and without imputation of ESRD at ESRD onset, and results were
similar. A key measure of kidney disease, albuminuria, was not
available at the baseline visit, and adjustment for this variable may
have attenuated differences by race and APOL1 risk status. On the
otherhand,albuminuriamay mediatethekidney functiondecline
seen among blacks with APOL1 high-risk status, and adjustment
for factors on the causal pathway between exposure and outcome
is not always desirable.30 The effect of APOL1 high-risk status in
persons known to have elevated albuminuria requires further
study.
In conclusion, we report on the prognosis of the APOL1
high-risk genotype in the general population, demonstrating a
higher risk of ESRD and faster eGFR decline over 22.6 years of
follow-up. However, we also demonstrate large variability in
eGFR trajectory, such that the majority of blacks with the
high-risk genotype experience eGFR decline similar to blacks
without the high-risk genotype. More striking are the perva-
sive racial disparities in adverse health outcomes, which are
not explained by APOL1 risk alleles. Our findings suggest that
general population screening for the APOL1 high-risk geno-
type is not yet justified, and that interventions to improve
outcomes in blacks with and without the APOL1 high-risk
genotype are desperately needed.
CONCISE METHODS
Study Population
TheARICstudyisaprospectivecohortof15,792personsdrawnfromfour
communities (Washington County, Maryland; Jackson, Mississippi;
Forsyth County, North Carolina; suburban Minneapolis, Minnesota)
and has been described previously.31 Participants were aged 45–64 years
at baseline, visit 1 (1987–1989). Additional clinic examinations took
place from 1990 to 1992 (visit 2), 1993–1995 (visit 3), 1996–1998
(visit 4), and 2011–2013 (visit 5). For this study, persons with self-
reported race other than black or white (n=34), missing serum creatinine
at baseline (n=150), or missing genotyping data (the latter requirement
for blacks only, n=468) were excluded, for a final sample size of 15,140
participants. The institutional review board at all study sites approved the
study prior to data collection.
Assessment of APOL1 Risk Status
Genotyping was performed on 3757 blacks who gave informed consent
for genetic studies. The APOL1 risk alleles were directly genotyped
using Taqman assays. As described previously,32 the G1 risk allele was
defined by missense mutations at rs73885319 and rs60919145, and the
G2 allele was the 6-bp deletion at rs71785313. APOL1 high-risk status
was characterized as the presence of $2 risk alleles (G1/G1, G1/G2, or
G2/G2).APOL1 low-risk statuswasdefinedas,2 risk alleles. Allwhites
were imputed as APOL1 low-risk due to the low prevalence of APOL1
alleles in whites, as reported elsewhere.7
Covariate Assessment
Key demographic factors included age, sex, and self-reported race.
Body mass index was calculated using height and weight as measured
in light clothing at study visit 1. Diabetes at baseline was defined as
self-reported physician diagnosis, fasting glucose $126 mg/dl, ran-
dom glucose $200 mg/dl, or the use of antidiabetes medications.
Blood pressure was assessed after 5 minutes of rest in a series of three
measurements; we used the average of the second and third measure-
ment. Antihypertension medications were identified based on in-
spection of medication bottles supplied by the participant. Coronary
heart disease was defined on the basis of self-reported history of myo-
cardial infarction, coronary artery bypass surgery, angioplasty of
a coronary artery, or history of myocardial infarction detected on
electrocardiogram performed at visit 1. HDL cholesterol was mea-
sured using the Monotest Cholesterol enzymatic assay in the ARIC Cen-
tral Lipid Laboratory at Baylor College of Medicine (Houston, Texas).

CLINICAL EPIDEMIOLOGY
 Smoking was assessed by self-report and defined as current, former,
or never. Family income was assessed as an annual income $$25,000,
,$25,000, or not reported. Education was dichotomized as high school
graduate (yes/no).
Outcome Assessment
Kidney function was assessed through measurement of serum or
plasma creatinine at all visits except visit 3. Creatinine was assayed by
the modified kinetic Jaffe method, standardized to the National In-
stitute of Standards and Technology, and calibrated across visits by a
200-sample calibration substudy with repeated assays from each
visit.29 eGFR was calculated using these values and the Chronic Kid-
ney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration equation.33 Cases of ESRD
were determined through linkage to the US Renal Data System reg-
istry34; eGFR at the time of ESRD onset was imputed as 15 ml/min
per 1.73 m2. In sensitivity analysis, we also included eGFR abstracted
from intervening cardiovascular hospitalizations. These data were
collected starting in 2005 for heart failure hospitalizations and 2004
for cardiovascular hospitalizations.
Additional outcomes were determined through ARIC study surveil-
lance using both annual telephone interviews and abstraction of
hospitalization records, with follow-up until December 31, 2011.35–37
Incident hypertension was assessed at each annual telephone interview
as self-reported hypertension diagnosis or antihypertension medication
use, or systolic BP $140 mmHg,diastolic BP $90 mmHg, or the use of
antihypertension medications at a subsequent study visit. Incident dia-
betes was defined as self-reported diabetes diagnosis or use of diabetes
medications during study visits or annual telephone interviews. Incident
cardiovascular disease was defined as adjudicated incident coronary heart
disease (definite or probable myocardial infarction, fatal coronary heart
disease, or cardiac procedure) or adjudicated incident stroke. AKI was
defined as an International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision,
Clinical Modification code of 584.* in any position in the hospitalization
discharge diagnostic codes.38 Mortality was determined by linkage to the
National Death Index as well as the aforementioned active surveillance
techniques.
Statistical Analyses
Baseline characteristics were compared by race and APOL1 risk status
using t tests and chi-squared tests for continuous and categorical
variables, respectively. Incident events were calculated for ESRD,
hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and mortality using
person-time since baseline visit as the denominator and excluding
those with prevalent disease from the risk set. Age- and sex- adjusted
incidence rate ratios were determined for incident ESRD, hyperten-
sion, diabetes, and mortality as well as overall rates of hospitalizations
and AKI using Poisson regression.
To estimate eGFR slopes, we fit mixed models relating eGFR
measured at study visits to race–APOL1 risk status. Because persons
with ESRD are much more likely to miss subsequent follow-up visits,
we imputed eGFR as 15 ml/min per 1.73 m2 at the time of ESRD
onset in the primary analysis. Random intercept and random slopes
were used to incorporate individual variation in trajectories. Best
linear unbiased prediction estimates of eGFR slope over time were
obtained for each race–APOL1 high-risk group in unadjusted and
adjusted analyses.39 Risk factors used in adjustment were age, sex,
baseline coronary heart disease, body mass index, HDL cholesterol,
systolic BP, diabetes, smoking status, family income, and education as
covariates, incorporating interaction terms of each risk factor with
time. We compared a model including these covariates and race
with a model including these covariates, race, and APOL1 risk status
for the outcome of eGFR trajectory as well as for the discrimination of
incident ESRD with the use of C statistics. We also evaluated eGFR
trajectory among the 343 people with urine albumin-to-creatinine
ratios .30 mg/g at visit 4 (the first study visit in which urine albu-
minuria was quantified) and available subsequent trajectory data
(9 years of follow-up).
Several sensitivity analyses were performed. First, models were
additionally adjusted for time-varying hypertension, diabetes, cardio-
vascular disease, and AKI. Second, eGFR measured during hospitaliza-
tions wasincorporated in the mixed models. Finally, persons developing
ESRDwerecensoredattheirlaststudyvisitratherthanimputingeGFRat
the time of ESRD onset. All analyses were performed using StataMP
version 13.
