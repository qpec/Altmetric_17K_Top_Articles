 Immunotherapy with PD-1 checkpoint blockade is effective in only a minority of patients with 
cancer, suggesting that additional treatment strategies are needed. Here we use a pooled in vivo 
genetic screening approach using CRISPR–Cas9 genome editing in transplantable tumours in mice 
treated with immunotherapy to discover previously undescribed immunotherapy targets. We tested 
2,368 genes expressed by melanoma cells to identify those that synergize with or cause resistance 
to checkpoint blockade. We recovered the known immune evasion molecules PD–L1 and CD47, 
and confirmed that defects in interferon-γ signalling caused resistance to immunotherapy. 
Tumours were sensitized to immunotherapy by deletion of genes involved in several diverse 
pathways, including NF-κB signalling, antigen presentation and the unfolded protein response. In 
addition, deletion of the protein tyrosine phosphatase PTPN2 in tumour cells increased the 
efficacy of immunotherapy by enhancing interferon-γ-mediated effects on antigen presentation 
and growth suppression. In vivo genetic screens in tumour models can identify new 
immunotherapy targets in unanticipated pathways.
The notable clinical success of cancer immunotherapy using checkpoint blockade suggests 
that it is likely to form the foundation of curative therapy for many malignancies1,2. 
However, checkpoint blockade does not achieve sustained clinical response in most patients3 
and additional immunotherapeutic strategies are therefore needed.
A small number of genes, such as PD-L1, that enable tumours to evade the immune system 
have been discovered and are the focus of intense clinical development efforts4–7. Although 
cancer cells could, in theory, express many more genes that regulate their response or 
resistance to tumour immunity, strategies to systematically discover such genes are lacking.
Loss-of-function genetic screens have increasingly been used to study the functional 
consequences of gene deletion in tumour cells8,9. These approaches include pooled genetic 
screens using CRISPR–Cas9-mediated genome editing that simultaneously test the role of a 
large number of genes on tumour cell growth, viability or drug resistance10. However, these 
screens have not been used to directly evaluate the role of tumour immunity11,12.
Here we use a pooled loss-of-function in vivo genetic screening approach that uses 
CRISPR–Cas9 genome editing to discover genes that increase sensitivity or cause resistance 
to immunotherapy in a mouse transplantable tumour model.
In vivo genetic screen recovers immune evasion genes
We developed a pooled genetic screening approach to identify genes that increase or 
decrease the fitness of tumour cells growing in vivo in animals treated with immunotherapy 
(Fig. 1a). First, we engineered the B16 melanoma cell line to express Cas9 (Extended Data 
Fig. 1a) and confirmed efficient DNA editing using small guide RNAs (sgRNAs) targeting 
PD-L1 (Extended Data Fig. 1g, top). Next, we created a library of lentiviral vectors 
encoding 9,872 sgRNAs targeting 2,368 genes from relevant functional classes that were 
expressed at detectable levels in the tumour cell line (Extended Data Fig. 1b). After 
transduction and in vitro passage to allow gene editing to take place, we transplanted the 
tumour cells into animals that were then treated with either a granulocyte-macrophage 
colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF)-secreting, irradiated tumour cell vaccine (GVAX) or

 GVAX combined with PD-1 blockade using a monoclonal antibody against PD-1 to generate 
an adaptive immune response sufficient to apply immune-selective pressure on the tumour 
cells13–15 (Fig. 1b and Extended Data Fig. 1c). In parallel, we transplanted the library-
transduced tumour cells into Tcra−/− mice, which lack CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and were 
therefore unable to apply adaptive immune-selective pressure on the tumours. After 12–14 
days, we collected the tumours (Fig. 1b and Extended Data Fig. 1c) and compared the 
library representation in tumours from immunotherapy-treated wild-type animals to tumours 
growing in Tcra−/− mice (Extended Data Fig. 1d–f, h).
Inspection of the list of genes targeted by sgRNAs that are depleted from tumours treated 
with immunotherapy revealed the known immune evasion molecule PD-L1, indicating that 
loss of PD-L1 increased the sensitivity of tumour cells to immune attack. sgRNAs targeting 
PD-L1 were not depleted from tumours in Tcra−/− mice relative to cells growing in vitro, 
presumably owing to the absence of T-cell-mediated selective pressure (Fig. 1c), but were 
significantly depleted from tumours in wild-type mice treated with GVAX relative to Tcra−/− 
mice (false discovery rate (FDR) = 0.004). However, the depletion of PD-L1-targeting 
sgRNAs observed in GVAX-treated tumours was not found in tumours treated with GVAX 
and anti-PD-1, suggesting that loss of PD-L1 does not confer a selective disadvantage to 
tumours when PD-L1–PD-1 interactions are blocked (Fig. 1c).
We also found that sgRNAs targeting CD47, which enables immune evasion by impairing 
engulfment of tumours cells by phagocytes6, were markedly depleted in tumours treated 
with either GVAX or with GVAX and PD-1 blockade (FDR = 0.005, FDR = 0.002, 
respectively) (Fig. 1d and Extended Data Fig. 1g, bottom). To confirm that CD47-null 
tumours were more susceptible to GVAX and PD-1 blockade, we generated CD47-null B16 
melanoma cells using transient transfection of a Cas9-sgRNA plasmid (Extended Data Fig. 
2a) and found that loss of CD47 significantly improved control of tumour growth mediated 
by GVAX and anti-PD-1 immunotherapy (Extended Data Fig. 2b, P < 0.01). Therefore, in 
vivo genetic screening recovered genes known to confer immune evasion properties on 
cancer cells.
Defects in the IFNγ pathway induces resistance
We next analysed genes that, when deleted, become significantly enriched in 
immunotherapy-treated tumours, as these might represent resistance mechanisms. We 
observed that sgRNAs targeting five genes required for sensing and signalling through the 
IFNγ pathway (Stat1, Jak1, Ifngr2, Ifngr1 and Jak2) were significantly enriched in 
immunotherapy-treated mice (Fig. 1e; FDR < 0.09). We confirmed this finding in an in vivo 
competitive assay that compared the relative growth of mixtures of isogenic Stat1-null or 
control B16 cells in animals treated with immunotherapy (Fig. 1f). In wild-type mice treated 
with GVAX and anti-PD-1 immunotherapy, the relative proportion of Stat1-null cells 
increased significantly (Fig. 1g, h; P < 0.01, Student’s t-test), suggesting that Stat1-null cells 
have a marked growth advantage over wild-type tumour cells when under immune attack. 
Similar results were obtained for Jak1-null and Ifngr1-null cells (Fig. 1h). Consistent with 
this finding, tumours deficient in Stat1 or Ifngr1 (Extended Data Fig. 4a, c) grew 
significantly faster than wild-type tumours when treated with immunotherapy (Extended

 Data Fig. 2c; P < 0.05, Student’s t-test). Similar trends were observed for Jak1-null tumours 
(Extended Data Fig. 2c), and in the BrafV600E/Pten−/− (Braf/Pten) mouse melanoma line 
(J.L. et al., submitted). Mice injected with Braf/Pten melanoma cells deficient in Stat1, Jak1 
or Ifngr1 (Extended Data Fig. 4b, d) had significantly larger tumours and shorter survival 
than mice with wild-type tumours when treated with PD-1 blockade (Extended Data Fig. 2d; 
P<0.05, Student’s t-test; P<0.0001, log-rank test). Therefore, the efficacy of immunotherapy 
in both melanoma models depends in part on the sensing of IFNγ by tumour cells.
We next sought to determine why IFNγ-pathway mutant tumours were resistant to 
immunotherapy. IFNγ-pathway-deficient B16 tumour cells had a significant growth 
advantage over wild-type tumour cells when exposed to IFNγ or IFNβ (Extended Data Fig. 
2e, P <0.001, Student’s t-test). In addition, tumour cells deficient in Stat1, Jak1 or Ifngr1 
failed to upregulate MHC-I presentation molecules after stimulation with IFNγ (Extended 
Data Fig. 2f). Indeed, co-culture of wild-type and Stat1-null tumour cells that had been 
engineered to express the model antigen ovalbumin (OVA) with antigen-specific OT-I CD8+ 
T cells resulted in a significantly larger fraction of Stat1-null B16 cells surviving relative to 
wild-type B16 cells (Extended Data Fig. 2g; P < 0.001, Student’s t-test), suggesting 
decreased sensitivity of Stat1-null tumour cells to the effects of cytotoxic T cells. Thus the 
screening platform recovered both known immune evasion molecules and mechanisms of 
resistance to immunotherapy.
Gene targets that increase efficacy of immunotherapy
Among the 50 most-depleted genes in immunotherapy-treated mice (all with an FDR < 
0.08), we identified four prominent biological pathways. sgRNAs targeting genes involved 
in: (i) TNF signalling/NF-κB activation; (ii) antigen processing and presentation; (iii) 
inhibition of kinase signalling; or (iv) the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway were markedly 
depleted in mice treated with GVAX and PD-1 blockade (Fig. 2a) relative to growth in Tcra
−/− mice. In many cases, multiple members of the same pathway (for example, Erap1, Tap2, 
Calr) or even the same multi-protein complex (for example, Rbck1, Rnf31, Birc2) were 
depleted under immune selective pressure, underscoring the importance of these diverse 
biological pathways.
We selected representative genes from each of these four groups to validate based on their 
highest cumulative score as ranked by the STARS algorithm (see Methods). These genes 
were Ptpn2, a phosphatase involved in multiple signalling processes; H2-T23, a non-
classical MHC-I gene; Ripk1, a kinase that regulates cell death and inflammation; and 
Stub1, an E3 ubiquitin ligase involved in the regulation of the unfolded protein response. In 
vivo competition assays showed that tumour cells deleted of each of the four genes were 
strongly selected against in wild-type animals treated with immunotherapy, but grew at 
equivalent rates to control tumour cells in vitro and in Tcra−/− mice (Fig. 2b, c; P< 0.01, 
Student’s t-test). This suggests that loss of function of these genes renders tumour cells more 
sensitive to immunotherapy, but does not alter their cell growth or survival in the absence of 
T cells.

 H2-T23 encodes Qa-1b (HLA-E in humans), a non-classical MHC molecule that binds the 
inhibitory receptor NKG2A on T cells and natural killer (NK) cells16. We confirmed that 
loss of function of Qa-1b enhanced the efficacy of immunotherapy by comparing the growth 
of H2-T23-null B16 melanoma cells (Extended Data Fig. 4g) to control B16 tumours in 
mice treated with GVAX and PD-1 blockade. Immunotherapy in control tumours eradicated 
only 1 out of 10 tumours. By contrast, immunotherapy of H2-T23-null tumours was curative 
in all 10 animals (Fig. 2d, e; P < 0.05, Student’s t-test). These results indicate that Qa-1b 
functions as an immune evasion molecule in tumours and that loss of function of H2-T23 
improves tumour immunity.
Loss of Ptpn2 sensitizes tumours to immunotherapy
We next focused on Ptpn2, and confirmed that loss of Ptpn2 sensitized tumours to 
immunotherapy in in vivo competition assays with two additional sgRNAs (Extended Data 
Fig. 3a–c; P < 0.01, Student’s t-test; all sgRNAs shown). Ptpn2-null B16 tumours were 
significantly more sensitive to immunotherapy (Fig. 3a; P < 0.01, Student’s t-test; Extended 
Data Fig. 3d; P < 0.001, log-rank test), but did not show any growth disadvantage in the 
absence of T-cell-mediated immunity or immunotherapy (Extended Data Fig. 5a–d). Loss of 
Ptpn2 also increased sensitivity to T-cell immunity in the Braf/Pten melanoma model (Fig. 
3b and Extended Data Fig. 4f), and the MC38 colon carcinoma model (Extended Data Fig. 
5). Thus, loss of Ptpn2 sensitizes tumour cells to the effect of immunotherapy.
Enforced expression of PTPN2 in Ptpn2-null tumour cells (that is, Ptpn2 rescue) abrogated 
the sensitivity to immunotherapy in vivo (Fig. 3c, d; P < 0.05, Student’s t-test), suggesting 
that off-target effects of gene editing were not likely to be the cause of the increased 
sensitivity. Moreover, overexpression of Ptpn2 in control B16 tumour cells (that is, Ptpn2 
overexpression) led to an outgrowth of tumour cells in immunotherapy-treated mice (Fig. 3c, 
d; P < 0.001, Student’s t-test), indicating that increased Ptpn2 expression renders tumour 
cells resistant to the effect of immunotherapy.
To determine whether PTPN2 amplification was associated with immunotherapy resistance 
in human cancer, we examined exome-sequencing data from patients treated with blockade 
of PD-1, PD-L1 or CTLA-4. PTPN2 amplification occurred in 20 patients, but the majority 
of these events were chromosomal or arm-level amplifications. Focal amplification occurred 
in only two patients, a number too small to conclusively determine whether PTPN2 
amplification results in a mechanism of resistance (Extended Data Fig. 6).
Ptpn2 loss increases antigen presentation by tumours
To identify the mechanisms by which loss of Ptpn2 enhanced the efficacy of 
immunotherapy, we compared the composition of immune cell subsets in the tumour 
microenvironment of control and Ptpn2-null tumours using flow cytometry. We observed no 
difference in the total number of CD45+ cells, NK cells, CD4+ T cells, FoxP3+ regulatory T 
cells, or cells in the myeloid compartment in Ptpn2-null tumours relative to wild-type 
tumours (Fig. 4a and Extended Data Figs 7a–d, 8a, b). However, Ptpn2-null tumours 
contained a significantly greater number of CD8+ T cells and γδ+ T cells (Fig. 4a; P < 0.05, 
Manguso et al.

 Student’s t-test). We confirmed this observation with immunohistochemistry staining and 
found a threefold increase in the number of CD8α+ cells, which diffusely infiltrated Ptpn2-
deficient tumours (Fig. 4b; P < 0.01, Student’s t-test) treated with immunotherapy. Further 
flow cytometry analysis revealed that Ptpn2-null tumours contained an increased fraction of 
CD8+ T cells expressing granzyme B (Fig. 4c; P < 0.01, Student’s t-test). Thus, Ptpn2 loss 
increased the number of activated, cytotoxic CD8+ T cells in tumours.
We reasoned that the increase in number of cytotoxic CD8+ T cells in Ptpn2-null tumours 
could be due to improved recognition of tumour cells through increased antigen 
presentation. To test this, we expressed full-length OVA in Ptpn2-null or control B16 cells. 
Staining with a monoclonal antibody specific to the SIINFEKL epitope from OVA in the 
context of H2K(b) was significantly higher in Ptpn2-null cells, suggesting that loss of Ptpn2 
increased the levels of antigen-loaded MHC-I on the surface of tumour cells (Fig. 4d; P 
<0.001, Student’s t-test). Additionally, Ptpn2-deficient cells had increased total MHC-I after 
treatment with IFNγ compared with control cells (Extended Data Fig. 9a; P< 0.01, Student’s 
t-test).
To test whether loss of Ptpn2 made tumour cells more recognizable to T cells, we cultured 
OVA-expressing Ptpn2-null or control cells with OT-I CD8+ T cells that recognize the 
SIINFEKL epitope. T cells cultured with Ptpn2-null OVA-B16 cells were significantly more 
activated as measured by intracellular IFNγ and TNF staining (Fig. 4e; P < 0.001, Student’s 
t-test). To test whether Ptpn2-null tumour cells were more sensitive to the presence of T 
cells, we co-cultured mixed populations of OVA-expressing Ptpn2-null or wild-type B16 
cells with antigen-specific CD8+ T cells for six days. Ptpn2-deficient tumour cells were 
preferentially depleted from the co-culture (Fig. 4f; P< 0.05, Students t-test). Thus, loss of 
Ptpn2 in tumour cells increased antigen presentation and sensitivity to cytotoxic CD8+ T 
cells.
Loss of Ptpn2 increases IFNγ sensing by tumour cells
Ptpn2 negatively regulates IFNγ signalling by dephosphorylating JAK1 and STAT1 (refs 
17, 18). We tested whether Ptpn2 loss sensitized tumours to immunotherapy by increasing 
IFNγ signalling. We first assayed STAT1 activity in Ptpn2-null cells in response to IFNγ 
stimulation. Ptpn2-null B16 cells showed increased phosphorylated (p-)STAT1 after 
treatment with IFNγ while overexpression of Ptpn2 repressed this phosphorylation (Fig. 5a).
Transcriptional analysis of the Ptpn2-null and control B16 tumour cells exposed to IFNγ, 
TNF or both indicated that loss of Ptpn2 caused a marked change in the expression profile of 
IFNγ response genes following IFNγ exposure, but did not change gene expression in 
unstimulated conditions or after TNF stimulation alone (Fig. 5b; Supplementary Information 
2). Co-stimulation of IFNγ and TNF had a synergistic effect on Ptpn2-null cells, because 
IFNγ stimulation appeared to sensitize B16 cells to TNF (Extended Data Fig. 9b). Loss of 
function of PTPN2 in four human tumour cell lines also increased expression of IFNγ 
response genes following stimulation with IFNγ (Fig. 5c; FDR < 0.001). Several T cell 
chemokines were upregulated in Ptpn2-null cells (Cxcl9, Cxcl10, Cxcl11 and Ccl5; Fig. 5b), 
which might increase infiltration of T cells into tumours. Members of the antigen processing

 and presentation pathway, such as Tap1, Tapbp and B2m were also upregulated in Ptpn2-null 
cells (Fig. 5b), consistent with our previous observation of enhanced antigen presentation in 
Ptpn2-deficient cells.
Cell-cycle regulators such as Cdkn1a and several genes involved in apoptosis, such as 
Casp4, Casp8, Ifit2, Ripk1 and Bak1 were significantly upregulated in Ptpn2-null tumour 
cells treated with cytokines relative to wild-type tumour cells. Consistent with this finding, 
exposure to IFNγ alone or in combination with IFNβ or TNF significantly reduced the 
growth of Ptpn2-null mouse (Fig. 5d; P < 0.001, Student’s t-test) and human (Fig. 5e; P< 
0.01, Students t-test) tumour cell lines in vitro relative to wild-type tumour cells. These 
results demonstrate that IFNγ alone is sufficient to cause a growth disadvantage in both 
mouse and human tumour cells that lack Ptpn2/PTPN2.
Sensitivity of Ptpn2-null tumours depends on IFNγ
To determine whether the mechanism of increased immunotherapy sensitivity of Ptpn2-null 
tumour cells depends on IFNγ sensing and signalling, we generated B16 tumour cell lines in 
which Ptpn2 had been knocked out and Stat1, Jak1, Ifngr1 or Ifnar2 had also been knocked 
out (Fig. 5f). We then tested the growth of these double-null cells relative to tumour cells 
lacking only Stat1, Jak1, Ifngr1 or Ifnar2 in animals treated with GVAX and anti-PD-1 
immunotherapy. Loss of Ptpn2 alone was associated with a significant growth disadvantage 
in the presence of immunotherapy as expected (Fig. 5g, h). However, simultaneous loss of 
function of any of the genes necessary for the sensing of IFNγ abolished the growth 
disadvantage of Ptpn2-null cells (Fig. 5g, h; P < 0.01, Student’s t-test). Loss of Ifnar2, a 
gene that senses type I interferon, did not abrogate the sensitivity of Ptpn2-null tumours to 
GVAX and anti-PD-1 immunotherapy (Fig. 5h). This genetic epistasis experiment indicates 
that in tumour cells that are unable to respond to IFNγ signalling, Ptpn2 deficiency cannot 
sensitize tumour cells to immunotherapy. Thus, the mechanism by which Ptpn2 deficiency 
sensitizes tumour cells to immunotherapy is dependent on the sensing of IFNγ.
Discussion
We used pooled loss-of-function genetic screens in vivo to discover multiple genes in 
diverse biological processes that sensitize tumours to immunotherapy, providing a new 
approach for immuno-oncology target discovery. Deletion of Ptpn2 markedly increased the 
response of tumours to immunotherapy. Ptpn2 encodes a protein tyrosine phosphatase that 
regulates a range of intracellular processes, including IFNγ signalling, which it can inhibit 
by dephosphorylating STAT1 and JAK1 (refs 17–21). Loss of Ptpn2 in tumour cells increased 
IFNγ signalling and antigen presentation to T cells, and amplified growth arrest in response 
to cytokines, suggesting that its therapeutic inhibition may potentiate the effect of 
immunotherapies that invoke an IFNγ response.
Loss of function of Qa-1b (the non-classical MHC molecule encoded by H2-T23, or HLA-E 
in humans) increased sensitivity of tumour cells to immune attack. The function of Qa-1b/
HLA-E in tumour immunity has been unclear, because it can bind to both activating and 
inhibitory receptors expressed by T cells and NK cells16,22, and because it has been

 variously reported to be associated with good or bad clinical outcomes23,24. Loss of function 
of Qa-1b may increase the immune response to tumours by de-repression of T- or NK-cell 
function25,26 or by limiting the stimulation of CD8+ T regulatory cells27, either of which 
would make blockade of HLA-E an attractive immunotherapeutic approach.
Tumours were also sensitized to immunotherapy by deletion of Ripk1, as well as by loss of 
function of members of the linear ubiquitin assembly complex (LUBAC), Birc2, Rbck1 or 
Rnf31, that responsible for ubiquitination and stabilization of the signalling complex that 
includes Ripk1. Ripk1 has a complex role in the response to inflammation, including 
activation of NF-κB-mediated survival pathways28. Strategies to alter the stability of Ripk1 
in tumours may provide additional therapeutic avenues to enhance tumour immunity.
Functional genomic approaches using genome editing have to date focused on identifying 
genes required by tumour cells for the cancer hallmarks of growth, metastasis and drug 
resistance11,12,29. Our study extends this approach to interrogate the interaction of the 
tumour cell with the immune system. We anticipate that it can be broadly applied to 
systematically define genes that govern interactions between cancer cells and the immune 
system.
METHODS
In vivo CRISPR screening in B16 tumour cells
We created a Cas9-expressing version of the B16 melanoma cell line and confirmed that it 
could edit DNA efficiently with CRISPR using sgRNAs targeting the PD-L1 gene. For 
screening the B16-Cas9 cell line, we created a library of 9,992 optimized sgRNAs targeting 
2,398 genes, which were selected from the Gene Ontology (GO) term categories: kinase, 
phosphatase, cell surface, plasma membrane, antigen processing and presentation, immune 
system process, and chromatin remodelling. The transcript abundance of the genes in these 
categories were then filtered to include only those that were expressed > RPKM(log2) = 0.9. 
These genes were then ranked for expression in the B16 cell line using RNA-sequencing to 
select for the top 2,398 expressed genes. The library was divided into four sub-pools, each 
containing one sgRNA per gene and 100 non-targeting control sgRNAs. The four sub-pools 
were screened individually and sgRNAs were delivered to B16-Cas9 cells via lentiviral 
infection at an infection rate of 30%. Transduced B16 cells were purified using an hCD19 
reporter by positive magnetic selection (Miltenyi) and then expanded in vitro before being 
implanted into animals. For each sub-pool, B16 cells were implanted into 10 Tcra−/− mice, 
10 wild-type mice treated with GVAX, and 10 wild-type mice treated with GVAX and PD-1 
blockade (see below for treatment protocols). B16 cells transduced with libraries were also 
grown in vitro at approximately 2,000× library coverage for the same time period as the 
animal experiment. Mice were euthanized 12–14 days after tumour implantation and tumour 
genomic DNA was prepared from whole tumour tissue using the Qiagen DNA Blood Midi 
kit. PCR was used to amplify the sgRNA region and sequencing to determine sgRNA 
abundance was performed on an Illumina HiSeq. Significantly enriched or depleted sgRNAs 
from any comparison of conditions were identified using the STARS algorithm31.

Animal treatment and tumour challenges
The designs of these animal studies and procedures were approved by the Dana-Farber 
Cancer Institute IACUC committee. Dana-Farber Cancer Institute’s specific-pathogen free 
facility was used for the housing and care of all mice. Seven-week old wild-type female 
C57BL/6J mice were obtained from Jackson laboratories. A colony of B6.129S2-
Tcratm1Mom/J (Tcra−/−) T cell-deficient mice were bred on site. Mice were age-matched to 
be 7–12 weeks old at the time of tumour inoculation. For screening, 2.0 × 106 library-
transduced B16-Cas9 cells resuspended in Hanks Balanced Salt Solution (Gibco) were 
mixed 1:1 by volume with Matrigel (Corning) and subcutaneously injected into the right 
flank on day 0. Mice were vaccinated with 1.0 × 106 GM-CSF-secreting B16 (GVAX) cells 
(provided by G. Dranoff) that had been irradiated with 3,500 Gy on days 1 and 4 to elicit an 
anti-tumour immune response. Subsequently, mice were treated with 100 μg of rat 
monoclonal anti-PD1 (clone: 29F.1A12) on days 9 and 12 via intraperitoneal injection. For 
validation assays, 1.0 × 106 tumour cells were subcutaneously injected into the right flank 
without Matrigel. Tumours were measured every three days beginning on day 6 after 
challenge until time of death. Death was defined as the point at which a progressively 
growing tumour reached 2.0 cm in the longest dimension. Measurements were taken 
manually by collecting the longest dimension (length) and the longest perpendicular 
dimension (width). Tumour volume was estimated with the formula: (L × W2) / 2.CO2 
inhalation was used to euthanize mice on the day of euthanasia. Optimal group sizes were 
determined empirically. Researchers were not blinded to group identity and randomization 
of animal groups was done when appropriate.
Creation of CRISPR-edited tumour cell lines
Transient transfection of the Cas9-sgRNA plasmid (pX459, Addgene) was used to edit B16 
and Braf/Pten melanoma cell lines. pX459 was digested with the enzyme Bpil (Thermo 
Fisher Scientific) as per the manufacturer’s instructions and sgRNA oligos were cloned into 
the plasmid using standard molecular cloning. For B16 cells, 5 × 105 cells were plated in a 
well of a six-well plate and were transfected the following day using 2 μg of pX459 plasmid 
DNA and Turbofect (3:1 ratio, Thermo Fisher Scientific). After 24 h of transfection, 
transfectants were selected in puromycin (6 μg ml−1, Thermo Fisher Scientific). For Braf/
Pten melanoma cells, 5 × 105 cells were plated in a well of a six-well plate and were

 transfected the following day using 4 μg of pX459 plasmid DNA and Turbofect (3:1 ratio). 
After selection, cells were grown for 14 days in vitro before being implanted into mice.
In vivo competition assays
B16 cells were engineered to express GFP or tdTomato by lentiviral transduction to 
differentiate populations. Cas9-target sgRNA-transfected cells and Cas9-control sgRNA-
transfected cells were mixed and then grown for at least two passages in vitro before 
implantation into mice. Mixes were analysed by flow cytometry on the day of tumour 
inoculation. Mice were euthanized 15–21 days after tumour inoculation for tumour 
collection. Tumours were macerated on ice and incubated in collagenase P (2 mg ml−1, 
Sigma-Aldrich) and DNase I (50 μg ml−1, Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented DMEM for 10 min 
at 37 °C. After incubation, tumour cells were passed through 70-μm filters to remove 
undigested tumour. Tumour cells were washed with ice-cold MACS medium and stained 
with Near-IR Live/Dead (1:1,000, BD Biosciences) for 10 min on ice. Tumour cells were 
then washed and resuspended in ice-cold PBS with 2% FBS. An Accuri C6 flow cytometry 
system (BD Biosiences) was used to analyse final GFP:tdTomato tumour cell ratios.
In vitro cytokine stimulations
Differentially labelled B16 cells were plated in 12-well plates in DMEM + 10% FBS 
containing the indicated combinations of cytokines: TNFα (10ng ml−1, PeproTech), IFNγ 
(100ng ml−1, Cell Signaling) and IFNβ (1,000 U ml−1, Pbl Assay Science). Cells were 
passaged every three or four days. On day 14, tumour cells were analysed by flow cytometry 
for changes in the ratio of GFP+:tdTomato+ cells.
In vitro T cell killing assays
Differentially labelled, ovalbumin-expressing B16 cells were plated onto 12-well plates in 
DMEM + 10% FBS containing IFNβ at 50 U ml−1. The following day, medium was 
removed and RPMI + 10% FBS was added containing preactivated OT-I T cells at the 
indicated ratio. Tumour cells were passaged and fresh OT-I T cells were added every two 
days until day 6. On day 6, tumour cells were analysed by flow cytometry for changes in the 
ratio of GFP+:tdTomato+ cells.
Analysis of tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes by flow cytometry
Mice were injected subcutaneously with 1.0 × 106 CRISPR–Cas9 modified B16 cells and 
treated with GVAX and anti-PD-1, as above. Tumours were collected on day 12–13, 
weighed, mechanically diced, incubated with collagenase P (2 mg ml−1, Sigma-Aldrich) and 
DNase I (50 μg ml−1, Sigma-Aldrich) for 10 min, and pipetted into a single-cell suspension. 
After filtering through a 70-μm filter, cells were blocked with anti-mouse CD16/32 antibody 
(BioLegend) and stained with indicated antibodies for 30 min on ice. Dead cells were 
excluded using Aqua Live/Dead (1:1,000, ThermoFisher Scientific) added concurrently with 
surface antibodies. After washing, cells were fixed with Foxp3/Transcription Factor Staining 
Buffer Set (eBiosciences) as per manufacturer’s instructions, blocked with mouse and rat 
serum, then stained with intracellular antibodies. Spherotech AccuCount Fluorescent 
particles were added for cell quantification before analysis on an LSR Fortessa using single-

 colour compensation controls and fluorescence-minus-one thresholds to set gate margins. 
Comparisons between groups were performed using Student’s t-tests.
Flow cytometry analysis of B16 tumour cells
B16 cells were trypsinized and washed in PBS + 2% FBS, stained with antibodies against 
cell surface proteins as per the manufacturer’s instructions and then analysed on an Accuri 
C6 flow cytometry system.
Restimulation of T cells on B16 tumour cells
OT-I T cells were isolated from the spleens of OT-I T cell receptor transgenic mice using the 
CD8α+ T cell isolation mouse kit (Miltenyi), as per manufacturer’s instructions. Purified 
OT-I T cells were then stimulated in 24-well plates with plate-bound anti-mouse CD3ε (2 μg 
ml−1, BD Biosciences), soluble anti-mouse CD28 (2 μg ml−1, BD Biosciences) and 
recombinant human IL-2 (100 U ml−1, DFCI supply centre). After 48 h, activated OT-I T 
cells were transferred into fresh media containing recombinant human IL-2 and allowed to 
expand for 5–7 days. For restimulation, 1 × 105 OVA-expressing Ptpn2-null or control 
sgRNA-transfected B16 tumour cells were first plated in 24-well plates and stimulated with 
recombinant mouse IFNγ overnight to induce ovalbumin surface expression. 1 × 106 pre-
activated OT-I T cells were then added to the wells on the next day and co-cultured with the 
B16 tumour cells for 2–3 h. Subsequently, 1× brefeldin (eBiosciences) was added to the 
cultures for 4 h to inhibit intracellular protein transport. Afterward, OT-I T cells were 
collected from each well, stained for surface markers and then fixed with Foxp3/
Transcription Factor Staining Buffer Set (eBiosciences) as per the manufacturer’s 
instructions. Intracellular cytokine staining was then performed before analysis on an LSR 
Fortessa.
RNA-sequencing analysis of tumour cells
Ptpn2-null or control sgRNA-transfected B16 cells were stimulated with IFNγ (100ng ml−1, 
Cell Signaling Technology), TNFα (10 ng ml−1, Peprotech) or both for 48 h. RNA was 
extracted from cell pellets using the Qiagen RNeasy Mini kit according to the 
manufacturer’s instructions. First-strand Illumina-barcoded libraries were generated using 
the NEB RNA Ultra Directional kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions, including a 
12-cycle PCR enrichment. Libraries were sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq 500 instrument 
using paired-end 37 bp reads. Data were trimmed for quality using the Trimmomatic 
pipeline with the following parameters: LEADING:15 TRAILING:15 SLIDINGWINDOW:
4:15 MINLEN:16. Data were aligned to mouse reference genome mm10 using Bowtie2. 
HTSeq was used to map aligned reads to genes and to generate a gene count matrix. 
Normalized counts and differential expression analysis was performed using the DESeq2 R 
package. We performed gene set enrichment analysis, as described previously32,33.
Western blotting
Whole cell lysates were prepared in lysis buffer (60 mM Tris HCl, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 
complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor (Roche)) and 500 U ml−1 benzonase nuclease 
(Novagen). Samples were boiled at 100 °C and clarified by centrifugation. Protein

 concentration was measured with a BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). Subsequently, 50–150 μg 
of protein was loaded on 4–12% Bolt Bis-Tris Plus gels (Life Technologies) in MES buffer 
(Life Technologies). Protein was transferred to 0.45-μm nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-
Rad). Membranes were blocked in Tris-buffered saline plus 0.1% Tween 20 (TBS-T) 
containing 5% nonfat dry milk for 1 h at room temperature followed by overnight incubation 
with primary antibody at 4 °C. Membranes were washed with TBS-T and incubated with 
HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. HRP was activated with 
Supersignal West Dura Extended Duration Substrate (Pierce) and visualized with a 
chemiluminscent detection system using Fuji ImageQuant LAS4000 (GE Healthcare Life 
Sciences). Blots were then analysed using ImageJ and Adobe Photoshop software.
Immunohistochemistry
Whole B16 tumours were fixed for 24 h in 10% neutral-buffered formalin and then 
permeabilized in 70% ethanol overnight. Fixed tissue was subsequently embedded into 
paraffin, sectioned and then mounted onto slides for staining against mouse CD8α 
(eBiosciences, 14-0808-82). Slides were imaged on a Leica Scanscope XT and analysed 
using Aperio software.
Exome-sequencing analysis
All human studies were conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and 
approved by the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute Institutional Review Board (Protocols 11-104, 
02-180, 09-472, 02-021, 15-330). Informed consent was obtained from all subjects. 
Electronic medical charts were reviewed to assess best response by RECIST (version 1.1), 
duration of progressionfree survival, duration of overall survival, patient demographic 
characteristics and other relevant clinical details (for example, smoking history). Patients 
from the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute with metastatic bladder cancer, head and neck 
squamous cell carcinoma, lung cancer and melanoma treated with anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, 
anti-CTLA-4, or a combination of these therapies were identified, and pre-treatment tumour 
tissue and matched germline blood were obtained for exome sequencing. Copy-number 
alterations were called using a circular binary segmentation method34. Called copy-number 
ratio was corrected for tumour purity and ploidy using ABSOLUTE. A threshold of 
log2(copy ratio) > 0.5 was used to call amplifications. The amplified region containing 
PTPN2 for each tumour that was shown to be amplified was manually examined to 
determine whether the amplification was part of a chromosome-level, arm-level or focal 
amplification event. Patients were stratified by clinical benefit using the metric published 
previously35. In brief, patients with clinical benefit had a complete response or partial 
response by RECIST (version 1.1) or stable disease with overall survival exceeding one year. 
Patients with no clinical benefit had progressive disease as best response by RECIST or 
stable disease with overall survival less than one year. A third group of patients with PD but 
overall survival exceeding two years were called long-term survival with no clinical benefit.
