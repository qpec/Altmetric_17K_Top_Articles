abstract
BACKGROUND: Since mid-2006, human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination has been 
recommended for females aged 11 to 12 years and through 26 years if not previously 
vaccinated.
METHODS: HPV DNA prevalence was analyzed in cervicovaginal specimens from females aged 
14 to 34 years in NHANES in the prevaccine era (2003–2006) and 4 years of the vaccine 
era (2009–2012) according to age group. Prevalence of quadrivalent HPV vaccine (4vHPV) 
types (HPV-6, -11, -16, and -18) and other HPV type categories were compared between 
eras. Prevalence among sexually active females aged 14 to 24 years was also analyzed 
according to vaccination history.
RESULTS: Between the prevacccine and vaccine eras, 4vHPV type prevalence declined from 
11.5% to 4.3% (adjusted prevalence ratio [aPR]: 0.36 [95% confidence interval (CI): 
0.21–0.61]) among females aged 14 to 19 years and from 18.5% to 12.1% (aPR: 0.66 [95% 
CI: 0.47–0.93]) among females aged 20 to 24 years. There was no decrease in 4vHPV type 
prevalence in older age groups. Within the vaccine era, among sexually active females 
aged 14 to 24 years, 4vHPV type prevalence was lower in vaccinated (≥1 dose) compared 
with unvaccinated females: 2.1% vs 16.9% (aPR: 0.11 [95% CI: 0.05–0.24]). There were no 
statistically significant changes in other HPV type categories that indicate cross-protection.
CONCLUSIONS: Within 6 years of vaccine introduction, there was a 64% decrease in 4vHPV type 
prevalence among females aged 14 to 19 years and a 34% decrease among those aged 20 
to 24 years. This finding extends previous observations of population impact in the United 
States and demonstrates the first national evidence of impact among females in their 20s.

WHAT’S KNOWN ON THIS SUBJECT: Previous 
studies have found declines in vaccine type human 
papillomavirus (HPV) prevalence and genital warts 
among young females in the United States after 
introduction of the HPV vaccination program.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: This study extends 
previous observations of quadrivalent HPV vaccine 
impact and examines cross-protection. Within 6 
years of vaccine introduction, there were decreases 
in national vaccine type HPV prevalence of 64% and 
34% among females aged 14 to 19 years and 20 to 24 
years, respectively.

Three prophylactic human 
papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines are 
available, and they have been shown 
in clinical trials to have high efficacy 
for prevention of HPV vaccine-type 
infection and associated disease.1–3 
The bivalent vaccine targets HPV-16 
and -18; the quadrivalent vaccine 
(4vHPV) targets HPV-6, -11, -16, 
and -18; and the 9-valent vaccine 
(9vHPV), licensed at the end of 
2014, targets HPV-6, -11, -16, and 
-18 as well as 5 additional HPV 
types (31, 33, 45, 52, and 58). HPV 
vaccination has been recommended 
for females in the United States 
since mid-2006 and for males since 
20114; through 2014, almost all 
vaccines used were 4vHPV.5 Routine 
vaccination is recommended for 
females and males aged 11 or 12 
years and for females through age 
26 years and males through age 21 
years if not previously vaccinated. 
Although rates of HPV vaccination 
have been increasing in the United 
States, coverage is still low; in 2013, 
a national survey found that 57% 
of 13- to 17-year-old females had 
received at least 1 dose and 38% 
had received 3 doses.5 Despite 
this moderate coverage, data from 
NHANES exhibited a 56% decrease 
in 4vHPV type prevalence among 
females aged 14 to 19 years in the 
first 4 years of the vaccine era (2007–
2010) compared with the prevaccine 
era.6
The present report analyzes data 
from the 4 most recent years 
available from NHANES (2009–2012) 
and compares HPV prevalence with 
the prevaccine era (2003–2006). 
In these more recent years, vaccine 
coverage was higher than in the first 
4 years of the vaccine era evaluated 
previously.6,7 We also explore 
vaccine effectiveness, by analyzing 
HPV prevalence according to report 
of vaccination, herd effects, and 
potential cross- protection against 
non-4vHPV types.
METHODS
Survey Design and Population
NHANES is an ongoing series of 
cross-sectional surveys conducted 
by the National Center for Health 
Statistics, Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention (CDC). 
The surveys are designed to be 
nationally representative of the 
civilian, noninstitutionalized US 
population. Surveys are conducted 
in ∼15 counties, which vary each 
year. Consenting participants 
undergo a household interview 
followed by a physical examination 
in a mobile examination center 
(MEC). To increase the precision of 
estimates, NHANES oversampled 
certain subpopulations. In 1999 
to 2006, Mexican-Americans, non-
Hispanic blacks, low-income non-
Hispanic whites and others, as well 
as adolescents aged 12 to 19 years, 
were oversampled. Adolescents 
were not oversampled after 2006. 
In 2009 to 2012, all Hispanics were 
also oversampled and in 2011 to 
2012, Asians were also oversampled. 
Informed consent or assent was 
obtained from all participants and 
consent from guardians of minors. 
This survey was approved by the 
National Center for Health Statistics/
CDC Research Ethics Review Board.
NHANES data from 2003 to 2006 
and 2009 to 2012 were analyzed. 
Because adolescents were not 
oversampled after 2006, there was 
a reduced number of 14- to 19-year-
olds in the second time period. Years 
2003 to 2006 were considered the 
prevaccine era because vaccination 
was first recommended in June 2006. 
Analyses for the present report were 
limited to participants aged 14 to 34 
years with adequate self-collected 
cervicovaginal samples. In 2003 to 
2006, a total of 3325 females aged 14 
to 34 years were interviewed; 3210 
(96.5%) received an examination 
in an MEC. Of those, 2649 (82.5%) 
submitted a self-collected 
cervicovaginal swab, and 2587 
(80.6%) samples were adequate 
for DNA typing (as discussed in the 
Specimen Collection and Laboratory 
Methods section). In 2009 to 2012, 
a total of 2473 females aged 14 to 
34 years were interviewed; 2403 
(97.2%) received an examination 
in an MEC. Of those, 2070 (86.1%) 
submitted a cervicovaginal swab, 
and 2061 (85.8%) were adequate for 
DNA typing. HPV prevalence testing 
among males was not included in 
NHANES during this time period.
Demographic, Behavioral, and HPV 
Vaccination History
Demographic information was 
ascertained during household 
interviews. Sexual history 
information was collected among 
participants aged 14 to 59 years by 
using audio computer-assisted self-
interviews in an MEC. Respondents 
who reported ever having sex 
(described as vaginal, oral, or anal 
sex) were asked additional questions 
about their sexual history, including 
age at first sexual encounter, 
number of lifetime sex partners, and 
number of sex partners in the past 
12 months. NHANES 2003–2004 
did not collect information about 
partners in the past 12 months from 
persons aged 14 to 17 years. HPV 
vaccination history was collected 
beginning in 2007. Persons aged 
≥16 years and emancipated minors 
were interviewed directly. Parents/
guardians were interviewed 
regarding vaccination history for 
those aged <16 years.
Specimen Collection and Laboratory 
Methods
Females aged 14 to 59 years who 
were examined in an MEC were 
asked to self-collect a cervicovaginal 
sample.8,9 Extractions and testing 
were performed at the CDC as 
previously described.9 Briefly, 
extracted DNA was tested by using 
the Research Use Only Linear 
Array HPV Genotyping Test (Roche 
Molecular Diagnostics, Indianapolis, 
IN) with supplementary HPV-52

quantitative polymerase chain 
reaction, as previously described.9 
This assay uses L1 consensus 
polymerase chain reaction followed 
by type-specific hybridization for 
qualitative detection of 37 HPV types 
(6, 11, 16, 18, 26, 31, 33, 35, 39, 40, 
42, 45, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 58, 59,

and β-globin (control for sample 
amplification). Samples that tested 
negative for both HPV and β-globin 
were considered inadequate.
Data Analysis
The 2 most recent NHANES cycles 
of the vaccine era (2009–2010 
and 2011–2012) were combined 
to achieve stable estimates. The 
5-year age groups included in the 
present report are those in which an 
impact of vaccination would first be 
observed (14–19, 20–24, and 25–29 
years) and the next oldest age group 
(30–34 years). We analyzed report of 
at least 1 dose and 3-dose vaccination 
history in 2009–2012 and compared 
sexual behavior in 2009–2012 versus 
2003–2006.
HPV prevalence was compared 
among females in 2003–2006 and 
2009–2012 according to age group. 
HPV type categories investigated 
include any of 37 HPV types, 4vHPV 
types (6, 11, 16, and 18), 4vHPV 
high-risk types (16 and 18), any 
non-4vHPV types, non-4vHPV high-
risk types (31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 
56, 58, 59, 66, and 68), 3 high-risk 
types (31, 33, and 45) for which 
some cross-protection has been 
suggested10,11; and the 5 additional 
high-risk types in 9vHPV (31, 33, 
45, 52, and 58).3 In analyses limited 
to sexually active females aged 14 
to 24 years, we compared lifetime 
sex partners and race/ethnicity 
according to vaccination status in the 
vaccine era and compared these data 
with data from the prevaccine era. 
Vaccine effectiveness was evaluated 
for prevention of vaccine type HPV 
detection in 2009–2012; vaccination 
was defined as report of at least 1 
HPV vaccine dose.
All estimates were weighted by 
using sample weights to account for 
unequal probabilities of selection 
and adjustment for nonresponse.12 
Variance estimates were calculated 
by using a Taylor series linearization 
to account for the complex 
survey design.13 Logit confidence 
intervals (CIs) were calculated for 
prevalence estimates, with an α of 
.05. Prevalence estimates with a 
relative SE (RSE) >30% or based 
on <10 cases are noted; these are 
considered unstable and should 
be interpreted with caution. We 
calculated prevalence ratios, adjusted 
prevalence ratios (aPRs), and their 
95% CIs, adjusted for race/ethnicity 
(non-Hispanic black, non-Hispanic 
white, Mexican American, and 
other), and lifetime and past year 
number of sex partners. Because 
data on past year sex partners were 
not available for 14- to 17-year-
olds in 2003 to 2004, this variable 
was not included in some models. 
The prevalence ratio was the 
predicted probability calculated 
from the logistic regression model 
by using the PREDMARG statement 
in SAS-Callable SUDAAN.14 Vaccine 
effectiveness was calculated as 100 × 
(1 – aPR). Throughout the analyses, P 
values were not adjusted for multiple 
comparisons. Statistical analyses 
were conducted in SAS version 9.3 
(SAS Institute, Inc, Cary, NC) and 
SUDAAN version 11.0 (Research 
Triangle Institute, Research Triangle 
Park, NC).
RESULTS
HPV Prevalence Among All Females 
Aged 14 to 34 Years According to 
Age Group
In NHANES 2009–2012, receipt of 
at least 1 HPV vaccine dose was 
reported by 51.4% of females aged 
14 to 19 years, 32.6% aged 20 to 24 
years, 14.7% aged 25 to 29 years, and 
3.3% aged 30 to 34 years (Table 1). 
Between 2003–2006 and 2009–2012, 
there were no significant changes 
in the percentage of females who 
reported having had sex or in past 
year or lifetime sexual partners in 
any age group except 20- to 24-year-
olds. In this age group, a higher 
percentage of participants in 2009–
2012 than in 2003–2006 reported 
having ≥2 sex partners in the past 
year and ≥3 lifetime sex partners.
Among females aged 14 to 19 years, 
there were statistically significant 
declines in 4vHPV type prevalence, 
from 11.5% to 4.3% (aPR: 0.36 
[95% CI: 0.21–0.61]), as well as 
prevalence of HPV-16, -18, from 7.1% 
to 2.8% between the prevaccine 
and vaccine eras (Table 2). There 
were no significant differences in 
prevalence of HPV-31, -33, -45 in 
the prevaccine (4.3%) and vaccine 
(2.6%, RSE >30%) eras or the 5 
additional 9vHPV types (8.4% in 
the prevacccine era and 6.2% in the 
vaccine era). Among females aged 20 
to 24 years, there were statistically 
significant declines in 4vHPV type 
prevalence, from 18.5% to 12.1% 
(aPR: 0.66 [95% CI: 0.47–0.93]), 
and prevalence of HPV-16, -18, from 
15.2% to 10.5%. No statistically 
significant changes were observed 
in 4vHPV type prevalence among 
females aged 25 to 29 years or 30 
to 34 years. For individual types 
examined in the 2 youngest age 
groups, significant differences 
between the prevaccine and vaccine 
eras were observed for HPV-6, -16, 
and -56 among females aged 14 to 19 
years and for HPV-51 among those 
20 to 24 years (Supplemental Fig 1, 
Supplemental Tables 5 and 6).
HPV Prevalence Among Sexually 
Active Females Aged 14 to 24 Years, 
Overall and According to Vaccination 
History
Analyses according to vaccination 
history were limited to sexually 
active females aged 14 to 24 
years, combining the 2 age groups

in which declines in 4vHPV type 
prevalence were observed between 
the prevaccine and vaccine eras. 
Compared with the prevaccine era 
(58.4%), in the vaccine era, a larger 
percentage of females aged 14 to 
24 years overall (67.7%) and those 
unvaccinated (70.0%) reported 
≥3 lifetime sex partners (Table 3). 
There were no statistically significant 
differences in race/ethnicity (percent 
non-Hispanic white shown in Table 
3).
Any HPV type prevalence was similar 
in the prevaccine era (54.4%) and 
the vaccine era (58.1%) (Table 
4). Compared with the prevaccine 
era, 4vHPV type prevalence was 
significantly lower overall in the 
vaccine era (18.6% vs 10.8%; aPR: 
0.53 [95% CI: 0.40–0.71]) and among 
those vaccinated (18.6% vs 2.1%; 
aPR: 0.09 [95% CI: 0.05–0.18]). The 
4vHPV type prevalence among those 
unvaccinated in the vaccine era was 
not significantly different from the 
prevaccine era (18.6% vs 16.9%). 
Overall or according to vaccination 
history, there were no statistically 
significant differences in the vaccine 
era compared with the prevaccine 
era in the prevalence of non-4vHPV 
high-risk types; HPV-31, -33, -45; or 
the 5 additional 9vHPV types.
Within the vaccine era, there was 
no difference in the percentages of 
sexually active females reporting ≥3 
lifetime sex partners in vaccinated 
compared with those unvaccinated 
(Table 3). A larger percentage of 
vaccinated was non-Hispanic white. 
The 4vHPV type prevalence was 
lower among vaccinated compared 
with unvaccinated females (2.1% 
vs 16.9%; aPR: 0.11 [95% CI: 0.05–
0.24]), corresponding to a vaccine 
effectiveness of 89% (Table 4). There 
were no statistically significant 
differences between vaccinated 
and unvaccinated females in the 
prevalence of any HPV; non-4vHPV 
high-risk types; HPV-31, -33, -45; or 
the 5 additional 9vHPV types.
DISCUSSION
In this study of HPV prevalence in 
cervicovaginal specimens from a 
nationally representative sample 
of females in the United States, we 
extend our previous findings of 
vaccine impact with 2 additional 
years of data from NHANES.6 Our 
analysis using the 4 most recent 
years of data from the vaccine era 
(2009–2012) showed that among 
all females aged 14 to 19 years 
and 20 to 24 years, 4vHPV type 
prevalence decreased 64% and 
34%, respectively, compared with 
the prevaccine era. There was no 
statistically significant change in 
prevalence of any HPV or other 
categories of HPV types in these age 
groups and no decline in 4vHPV type 
prevalence among females aged 24 to 
29 years or 30 to 34 years.
The greatest decline in 4vHPV 
type prevalence observed in 14- to 
19-year-olds is consistent with the 
highest reported vaccine coverage 
in this age group. Of note, the 
percentage of females aged 14 to 19 
years who reported having received 
at least 1 vaccine dose in NHANES 
2009–2012 (51%) is similar to data 
from national coverage surveys.

MARKOWITZ et al 
found that 44% of women aged 19 
to 21 years and 28% aged 22 to 26 
years reported receipt of at least 1 
dose of HPV vaccine.15 In NHANES 
2009–2012, 33% of women aged 20 
to 24 years reported receipt of at 
least 1 dose.
In addition to our analysis of 
prevalence overall in the prevaccine 
and vaccine eras, we estimated 
vaccine effectiveness and explored 
herd effects and potential cross-
protection among sexually active 
14- to 24-year-olds. High vaccine 
effectiveness was found for 
prevention of 4vHPV types within 
the vaccine era (89%) and there was 
a large decline in prevalence among 
those vaccinated compared with the 
overall prevalence in the prevaccine 
era (18.6% to 2.1%). Among those 
unvaccinated, 4vHPV type prevalence 
was 18.6% in the prevaccine era and 
16.9% in the vaccine era; any HPV 
prevalence remained stable. In our 
previous analysis, using data from 
the first 4 years of the vaccine era, 
it was difficult to assess herd effects 
because there were differences 
in sexual behavior and lower 
prevalence of any HPV type among 
those unvaccinated compared with 
the prevaccine era.6 In the present 
analysis, a similar percentage of 
vaccinated and unvaccinated females 
reported >3 lifetime lifetime sex 
partners as well as prevalence of 
any HPV type. Although we cannot 
claim evidence of herd effects in 
this analysis, herd effects have been 
observed for both genital warts and 
4vHPV type prevalence in countries 
in which higher vaccination coverage 
has been achieved.16,17
We also examined the prevalence 
of 3 HPV types for which there 
has been some evidence of cross-
protection.10,11 The prevalence 
estimate for any HPV-31, -33, -45 
in the vaccine era among all female 
subjects aged 14 to 19 years was 
unstable; there was no statistically 
significant decline compared with 
the prevaccine era. We also found 
no vaccine effectiveness against 
these 3 types among females aged 
14 to 24 years in the vaccine era. 
Prelicensure clinical trials of both 
quadrivalent and bivalent vaccines 
investigated cross-protection against 
persistent infection and cervical 
intraepithelial neoplasia due to 
nonvaccine high-risk types.10,18–20 
Trials of bivalent HPV vaccine 
found more evidence of cross-
protection than did trials of 4vHPV. 
Other postlicensure prevalence 
evaluations have investigated cross-
protection.16,21,22 In England and 
Scotland, where the bivalent HPV 
vaccine was introduced, decreases 
were observed in HPV-16, -18, as 
well as related types, in the vaccine 
era.21,22 In Australia, where 4vHPV 
was introduced, HPV-6, -11, -16, 18 
prevalence among women aged 18 
to 24 years decreased from 37.6% to 
6.5%.16 For HPV-31, -33, -45, there 
was no statistically significant change

between the prevaccine and vaccine 
eras; within the vaccine era, however, 
a significant 58% effectiveness 
was observed. Further analyses of 
NHANES data will assess changes in 
HPV prevalence in the United States 
as HPV vaccine coverage increases. 
However, introduction of 9vHPV will 
make it more difficult to evaluate 
changes due to potential 4vHPV 
cross-protection for these 3 types 
beyond 2015.23
Finally, we also examined prevalence 
of the 5 additional 9vHPV types to 
provide a baseline before potential 
introduction of this vaccine. In the 
prevaccine era, the prevalence of 
any 5 additional types in 9vHPV 
was 8.4% and 16.5% in females 
aged 14 to 19 years and 20 to 24 
years, respectively, similar to the 
prevalence of HPV-16 and -18 in 
those age groups. Of note, these 5 
types cause substantially less HPV-
associated cancer than HPV-16, 
-18 because they are less likely to 
progress to cancer.24 In the United 
States, it is estimated that 66% of 
cervical cancers are attributable 
to HPV-16 and -18 compared with 
15% attributable to the 5 additional 
9vHPV types.25,26 There was no 
statistically significant difference in 
prevalence of the 5 additional 9vHPV 
types in the prevaccine/vaccine era 
comparison or in the comparison of 
vaccinated and unvaccinated sexually 
active females aged 14 to 24 years 
within the vaccine era. Although 
there were some statistically 
significant differences in prevalence 
of individual non-4vHPV types 
between the prevaccine and vaccine 
eras, these unadjusted comparisons 
should be interpreted with caution. 
Prevalence of individual types will 
continue to be evaluated in future 
cycles of NHANES.
Limitations of NHANES data have 
been described.6 First, vaccination 
history is by self-report in NHANES, 
and overreporting or underreporting 
could have occurred.27,28 In the United 
States, there is wide variation of 
HPV vaccine coverage by state, with 
coverage of ≥1 dose ranging from 
29% to 73% in 2012.29 NHANES 
design does not allow state-specific 
prevalence estimates; each cycle is 
designed to include a representative 
sample of the US population. Third, 
starting in 2007, adolescents were not 
oversampled. Some of our analyses 
were limited by small sample size, 
and some prevalence estimates were 
unstable. Although we adjusted 
the analyses for race/ethnicity and 
some sexual behaviors, we cannot 
exclude the possibility of changes or 
differences in sexual behaviors that 
were not measured by NHANES.
Ongoing analyses of NHANES will 
allow monitoring of HPV vaccine 
impact on HPV prevalence, duration 
of protection, possible cross-
protection, or type replacement. 
To date, there is no clear indication 
that type replacement is occurring. 
Given the low contribution of vaccine 
types to the overall prevalence of 
HPV in the population and because 
co-infections occur, a decrease in any 
HPV prevalence due to the declines 
in vaccine type HPV might not be 
observed, particularly if there is any 
increase in sexual risk behavior in the 
population (as we found in women 
aged 20–24 years).
Our data confirm previous findings 
of an early impact of HPV vaccination 
in the United States among females 
aged 14 to 19 years and extend the 
findings to females in their early 
20s. The decline in vaccine type 
prevalence after introduction of HPV 
vaccination is greater than expected 
based on current 3-dose coverage. 
This outcome could be due to herd 
protection or effectiveness of less than 
a complete 3-dose series, for which 
there is accumulating evidence.30,31 
There are now data on population 
impact of HPV vaccines from many 
countries32; most reports of declines 
in HPV vaccine type prevalence are 
from countries with higher coverage 
than the United States.16,21,22 Data 
from NHANES contribute to the 
increasing body of evidence on HPV 
vaccine impact and will continue to 
provide important information as 
coverage increases and vaccine policy 
changes in the United States.23
