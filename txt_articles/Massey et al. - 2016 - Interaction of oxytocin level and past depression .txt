Abstract
Purpose—We examined plasma oxytocin concentration and postpartum depression (PPD) 
symptom severity in women who were not depressed during pregnancy, and whether this differed 
by major depressive disorder (MDD) history.
Methods—We assessed psychiatric history and plasma oxytocin in 66 healthy pregnant women 
in the third trimester (M = 35 ± 3 weeks) and depressive symptoms at 6 weeks postpartum (M = 
5.9 ± 0.8 weeks). Linear regression analysis was used to examine oxytocin and PPD symptom 
severity, and moderation of oxytocin and PPD by past MDD.
Results—Women with (n = 13) and without (n = 53) past MDD differed in third trimester 
depressive symptom severity, but not oxytocin level, demographic factors or birth outcomes. 
Controlling for third trimester depressive symptoms, oxytocin level was unrelated to PPD 
symptom severity [B(SE) = −.019(.084); β = −.025; t = −.227; p = .821]. However, oxytocin level 
interacted with past MDD to predict PPD symptom severity [(B(SE) = 7.489(2.429); β = .328; t = 
3.084; p = .003]. Higher oxytocin predicted greater PPD symptom severity in women with past 
MDD (p = .019), but not in women without (p = .216).

Introduction
Major depressive disorder (MDD) occurring after birth, referred to as postpartum depression 
(PPD), is a common complication of childbearing, affecting some one in five mothers in the 
first postpartum year (Wisner et al. 2013). PPD has been associated with far-reaching 
adverse consequences to maternal and child health, including impaired maternal-infant 
bonding (McFarland et al. 2011), increased risk of recurrence of maternal depression 
(Yonkers et al. 2009), and the development of mental disorders and medical problems in 
children later in life (Wisner et al. 2006). A number of psychosocial predictors of PPD have 
been identified through systematic meta-analysis; these are a prior history of depression, 
depression during pregnancy, anxiety during pregnancy, general life stress, low social 
support, and low marital satisfaction (Robertson et al. 2004). As such, routine screening for 
PPD at the postpartum obstetric follow up visit is recommended by the American College of 
Obstetrics and Gynecology (ACOG 2015).
However, time constraints related to caring for a new infant, and social stigma associated 
with depression and mental health problems more broadly, still represent significant barriers 
to seeking professional help even among women who are identified with PPD (Goodman 
2009). Many mothers with PPD feel that they are failing because they expect that they 
should be happy, which decreases the likelihood that they will seek or accept help (Dennis & 
Chung-Lee 2006). If women who are destined to develop PPD could be accurately identified 
during pregnancy, prevention could implemented (Zlotnick et al. 2006). Obstetricians 
routinely screen for non-psychiatric complications of child bearing with similar prevalence 
to PPD, such as gestational diabetes, using readily available biomarkers (Wen et al. 2000). 
The prevalence and far-reaching adverse effects of PPD justify the search for biomarker 
screening as well.
Oxytocin, a neuropeptide hormone produced primarily in the hypothalamus, and released 
from the pituitary into the peripheral circulation, long known for its role in delivery and 
lactation (Carter 1998, Carter et al. 2001) has also received substantial attention for its role 
in social affiliation and behavior, stress management (Carter & Altemus 1997; Feldman 
2012), and increasingly, its potential for therapeutic benefit across a broad range of disorders 
(Meyer-Lindenberg et al. 2011), including PPD (Kim et al. 2014). There is also early 
evidence that measures related to oxytocin functioning, including plasma oxytocin 
concentration (Skrundz et al. 2011) and indices of oxytocin receptor availability (Bell et al. 
2015), may represent promising biomarkers of elevated risk for PPD. Clarification of these 
processes could support the future use of oxytocin as a screening biomarker for PPD during 
pregnancy.
However, a substantial challenge to the study of peripheral oxytocin concerns its accurate 
measurement. Recent findings using mass spectrometry suggest that following release,

 oxytocin is quickly bound or sequestered on components of blood. Only a small fraction of 
the oxytocin in peripheral circulation is detectable by conventional immunoassays (Martin-
Protean 2015), although the oxytocin measured by immunoassay may represent a 
biologically relevant, or free component. Moreover, immunoassays—either enzyme 
immunoassays (EIA) or radioimmunoassays (RIA)—indicate that free oxytocin levels vary 
inter-individually, and that transient increases can be measured in response to social 
interactions and also nonsocial stressors (Feldman et al. 2011).
Further complicating matters, the relationship between plasma oxytocin concentration and 
PPD may not be linear. Seay and colleagues (2014) found that very high and very low 
plasma oxytocin concentrations predicted an increase in depressive symptoms 10 weeks 
later. Similarly, in a detailed study involving multiple serial measurements of plasma 
oxytocin by RIA before, during, and after affiliative and stressful tasks, Cyranowski and 
colleagues (2008) showed that depressed women exhibited greater increases in oxytocin 
concentrations following a one-hour affiliation task compared to non-depressed women. 
Thus, it is possible that prior to the manifestation of clinically detectable depressive 
symptoms, individuals might experience dysregulation in oxytocin function. This could be 
reflected by abnormal variation in measured plasma oxytocin levels, in some cases as the 
oxytocin system attempts to compensate for reduced receptor availability or rapid changes in 
the hormone. This early dysregulation of the oxytocin system may be detectable as increases 
in concentrations of the oxytocin peptide in response to affiliative interactions as this system 
attempts to compensate for lower levels of receptor availability.
Finally, the relationship between oxytocin and depressive symptoms may vary by past 
exposure to MDD via stable dynamic transcriptional alterations to genes, or epigenetic 
mechanisms (Sun et al. 2013; Klengel et al. 2014). For example, methylation of the oxytocin 
receptor gene (OXTR) has been linked to past exposure to acute psychological stress 
exposure that predates the onset of MDD (Unternmaehrer et al. 2012). Recently, methylation 
of OXTR at key regulatory sites, indicative of reduced receptor expression, was found to be 
associated with a greater risk for PPD among a subset of women who had not experienced 
depression during pregnancy (Bell et al. 2015). Taken together, these findings suggest that 
MDD prior to pregnancy may render certain women more vulnerable to PPD, possibly 
mediated by methylation of OXTR, and subsequent dysregulation of oxytocinergic systems. 
These systems may in turn regulate affect and resilience in the face of stress (Tops et al. 
2013) which leads to increased vulnerability to PPD.
The first goal of this study was to determine the relationship between third trimester plasma 
oxytocin and PPD symptom severity. Based on findings by Skrundz et al., (2009) showing 
that women with lower third trimester oxytocin were at greater risk for developing PPD at 2 
weeks postpartum, we expected to find an inverse relationship between third trimester 
plasma oxytocin and depressive symptoms at 6 weeks postpartum. Next, we secondarily 
explored how the relationship between oxytocin and PPD symptom severity might differ by 
lifetime history of MDD. Based on limited literature, we hypothesized that among women 
with a history of depression prior to pregnancy, higher oxytocin levels would predict greater 
PPD symptom severity.

 Materials and Methods
Sample and Recruitment
Participants were 66 pregnant women recruited during their third trimester of gestation (M = 
34.9 weeks, SD = 3.3 weeks, range = 29 – 40 weeks) using online advertisements placed on 
websites of a large urban university medical center in the Midwest region of the United 
States. Flyers and brochures were also placed throughout the medical center campus, 
affiliated clinics, and in nearby local businesses. In addition to advertisements, a research 
assistant recruited participants from the waiting area of the academic faculty obstetric clinic 
by assessing interest in “a study about oxytocin and mood.” Informed consent was obtained 
from all individual participants included in the study. Potential participants were screened 
for the following preliminary inclusion criteria: age ≥ 18 years, English-literacy, and third 
trimester singleton pregnancy. Exclusion criteria were: (a) current mood disorder; (b) 
medical illness prior to or during pregnancy including diabetes, hypertension, sleep apnea, 
or thyroid disease; (c) current treatment for depression or anxiety; (d) fetal malformation or 
multiple gestation; (e) cigarette smoking beyond the 10th week of gestation; and (f) 
pregravid body mass index (BMI) > 32 kg/m2. Derivation of the final analytic sample is 
illustrated in Figure 1. Eligible women identified through initial screening who did not 
participate (n = 36) and participants lost to follow-up (n = 2) did not differ in any measured 
characteristics from those included in the analytic sample (n = 66).
Study procedures
Women who met initial inclusion and exclusion criteria were invited for baseline 
assessments. At the baseline visit, after completing written informed consent procedures, 
demographic information, parity, breast feeding intention, and estimated pre-gravid weight 
were obtained by a combination of patient report and medical records. Women were 
evaluated for a current mood disorder using a modified Mini International Neuropsychiatric 
Interview (MINI) Version 5.0.0 (Sheehan et al. 1998), the Mood Disorders Questionnaire 
(Hirschfield et al. 2000), and study assessments of depressive symptoms severity described 
below. None of the women who met initial inclusion and exclusion criteria through 
screening were found to have MDD or bipolar disorder at the baseline visit.
Following these assessments, women were escorted to the clinical research unit by the 
research assistant for blood draws. Prior to the blood draw, height, weight, and vital signs 
were measured by a research nurse. Participants were scheduled for follow up visits 
approximately 6 weeks following their projected due date (M = 5.9 weeks, SD = 6 days). 
The study coordinator checked medical records for actual delivery dates, and adjusted the 
timing of postpartum assessments such that they occurred as close to 6 weeks following 
delivery as possible. Women were offered the option to complete postpartum assessments 
either in person or by telephone. All but one women (98.5 %, n = 65 out of 66) opted for the 
telephone assessment. Participants were asked about birth outcomes and complications, and 
assessed again for depressive symptom severity. Participants were given a $50 gift card 
following completion of the postpartum assessments. Data collection began in March 2014 
and ended in June 2015. All participants were offered referrals for treatment at the end of the 
study. To ensure participant safety, all participants were urged to contact the study

 coordinator or PI if they developed worsening or new depressive symptoms from the 
baseline visit until the postpartum follow-up. Any participant requesting support or 
treatment, regardless of their depressive symptom severity, were invited to obtain it from the 
study center. All procedures were approved by the Institutional Review Board of 
Northwestern University prior to conduct and were performed in accordance with the ethical 
standards as laid down in the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki and its later amendments.
Measures
Depressive symptoms
Depressive symptoms during the third trimester and postpartum visits were assessed using 
the Inventory for Depressive Symptoms – Self Report 30 (IDS-SR30) (Rush et al., 2000). 
This 30-item questionnaire was designed to assess the severity of depressive symptoms in 
nine symptom domains using well-defined anchors. The IDS-SR30 was chosen for use in 
this sample due to its sensitivity to change in the lower range of scores relative to other 
depression scales (Rush et al., 2005). The IDS-SR30 contains the following cut points of 
symptom severity: 0 – 13 = no depression; 14 – 25 = mild depression; 26 – 38 = moderate 
depression; 39 – 48 = severe depression; 49 – 84 = very severe depression. In addition to the 
IDS-SR30, the 10-item Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) was also administered 
during the postpartum follow-up. A score of 10 or greater of the EPDS was considered a 
positive screen for depression (Cox et al. 1996).
Past Major Depressive Disorder
To evaluate a past history of major depressive disorder, Module A4 from the MINI, which 
assesses history of any past major depressive episodes (Sheehan et al. 1998), was 
administered. For participants meeting criteria for a past depressive episode, the length of 
time from resolution of the episode to the present time was recorded.
Blood sample preparation
To minimize diurnal fluctuations and variability due to social context, visits were conducted 
in the aforementioned order (assessments, followed by blood draw); all participants had 
blood samples drawn between 11:00 am and 1:00 pm. A 3 mL blood sample was drawn 
from a peripheral upper extremity vein into chilled glass dipotassium EDTA tubes and 
placed immediately on ice. After collection, the sample was centrifuged at 3500 rpm for 10 
minutes at 4° C. The plasma (supernatant) was collected as 400 μL aliquots into 1.5 ml 
Eppendorf tubes and immediately stored at −70° C until shipment. All samples were sent in 
one shipment packed in dry ice to the lab of Dr. Sue Carter at The Kinsey Institute of 
Indiana University for enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (EIA)
Measurement of oxytocin
The enzyme-immunoassay was based on kit ADI 901 153A from Enzo Life Sciences, 
Farmingdale, NY. Direct measurement of plasma was done following the 
manufacturers‘ protocols and samples were diluted 1:8 to obtain values on the most sensitive 
part of the standard curve. Samples were assayed without extraction in duplicate. The 
minimum detection limit for oxytocin was 15.6 pg/ml, with inter- and intra-assay

 coefficients of less than 10%. The distribution of oxytocin concentrations in this sample are 
shown in Figure 2.
It is worthwhile to note that previous studies assaying unextracted plasma samples from our 
laboratory used EIA kits ADI 901 153 from the same company (Enzo, previously Assay 
Designs), but using an older antibody that has since been depleted. The previous kits yielded 
reliable and consistent, albeit lower oxytocin values averaging around 250 - 350 pg/ml in 
samples from thousands of healthy adults (Goldman et al. 2008; Gouin et al. 2010; Rubin et 
al. 2010; Feldman et al. 2012; Hammock et al. 2012), including pregnant women 
(MacKinnon et al. 2014; Zelkowitz et al. 2014). We and other laboratories found that the 
newer ENZO kit (ADI 901 153A) gave values that were approximately 2.5 to 3 fold higher 
than those obtained with kit ADI 901 153. The precise origins of this shift in peptide values 
are unknown. However, the inter- and intra-assay coefficients of variation with the new kit 
remain small. Because of the consistency across laboratories, we assume that the change in 
basal values reflects differences in the antibody used in the new kits.
Data analysis
All variables were checked for normal distribution using both visual inspection and the 
Jarque-Bera goodness-of-fit test. Significantly skewed independent variables were 
transformed by natural logarithm prior to entry into the regression model. We examined data 
for outliers, defined as more than two standard deviations from the mean (none found). 
Participants were divided into those with a past MDD history and those without. 
Demographic and clinical characteristics were compared between these groups using t-tests 
and χ2 tests for continuous and binary variables, respectively. Variables were also examined 
for multi-co-linearity (defined a priori as r = .60) using bivariate correlation analysis (none 
found). The relationship between third trimester plasma oxytocin concentration and PPD 
symptom severity was examined using linear regression analysis, with third trimester 
depressive symptom severity as a covariate. Next, the relationship between oxytocin and 
PPD symptom severity was tested using past history of MDD as a moderator. In this second 
model, characteristics that differed between past MDD and no past MDD groups were 
entered as covariates.
Results
Characteristics for the whole sample, and by past MDD history are shown in Table 1. Racial 
and ethnic breakdown was as follows: non-Hispanic Caucasian 72.7 % (n = 48); African-
American 10.6% (n = 7); Asian 9.1 % (n = 6); Hispanic 7.6% (n = 5). The distribution of 
pre-gravid BMI in this sample was: Underweight (BMI < 18.5) = 4.5% (n = 3); normal 
weight (BMI 18.5 – 24.9) = 68.2% (n = 45); overweight (BMI 25 – 29.9) = 16.7% (n = 11); 
obese (BMI ≥ 30 - 32) = 10.6% (n = 7). Birth complications included preeclampsia (n = 2); 
infections (n = 2); prolonged labor/failure to progress n = 6; postpartum hemorrhage (n = 1); 
meconium stained amniotic fluid (n = 1), and breach presentation (n = 1).
Approximately one in five participants (n = 13) had a previous major depressive episode; the 
length of time between the most recent depressive episode and the current pregnancy ranged 
from 2.5 to 20 years (M = 10.3 years, SD = 6.8 years). Other past psychiatric diagnoses

 detected by the MINI were: panic disorder (n = 2); post-traumatic stress disorder (n = 1); 
obsessive-compulsive disorder (n = 1); generalized anxiety disorder (n = 1); alcohol abuse (n 
= 1); alcohol dependence (n = 1), marijuana abuse (n = 1), antisocial personality disorder (n 
= 1). Women in both past and no past MDD groups scored in the “no depression” to “mild 
depression” range on the IDS-SR30 in the third trimester and at 6 weeks postpartum. Mean 
EPDS scores were below the positive screening threshold of 10 in both groups. With the 
exception of past MDD and any past psychiatric history, no significant differences in third 
trimester measures, birth outcomes, or postpartum measures were found between past MDD 
and no past MDD groups. As shown in Figure 2, plasma oxytocin concentrations were 
normally distributed [skewness S(SE) = −.094 (.295); kurtosis C(SE) = −.664(.582)]. Scores 
from the third trimester IDS-SR30 assessment were right-skewed [S(SE) = 3.623(.295)] and 
therefore natural log-transformed prior to entry into the regression model.
Plasma oxytocin levels were unrelated to PPD symptom severity in univariate (r = .086; p = .
493) and multivariate [B(SE) = −.019(.084); β = −.025; t = −.227; p = .821] analyses. For 
the test of moderation of oxytocin and PPD symptom severity by past MDD history, 
regression coefficients are shown in Table 2 (F = 14.296 p < .001; df = 4; adjusted R2 = .
450). Third trimester depressive symptom severity predicted PPD symptom severity [(B(SE) 
= 4.219(.718); β = .554; t = 5.874; p < .001]. Third trimester plasma oxytocin concentration 
interacted with a history of past MDD to predict postpartum depressive symptom severity 
[(B(SE) = 7.489(2.429); β = .328; t = 3.084; p = .003]. Specifically, as illustrated in Figure 
3, higher plasma oxytocin concentration measured in the third trimester predicted greater 
PPD symptom severity in women with a history of MDD (p = .019), but not in women 
without (p = .216).
Discussion
In contrast to two similar studies to our knowledge (Skrundz et al. 2011; Eapen et al. 2014), 
we did not find an inverse relationship between third trimester plasma oxytocin level and 
PPD as hypothesized. Rather, we found a direct relationship between oxytocin and PPD 
symptom severity, though only among women with a lifetime history of depression. We 
carefully considered a number of potential explanations for our discrepant findings.
First, as transient increases in oxytocin levels have been shown following affiliative tasks 
(Cyranowski et al. 2008), it is important to note that in the current study, oxytocin was 
measured directly following approximately one hour of study assessments with the research 
assistant and study psychiatrist, followed by assessment of weight and vital signs by a study 
nurse. While not intended as such, these interactions among participants and research staff, 
could have simulated the effects of an affiliative task. Indeed the range of oxytocin levels in 
the current study were fairly narrowly, and normally distributed (Figure 2) in comparison to 
the very wide ranges and skewed distributions reported by others (Weisman et al. 2013; 
Lancaster et al. 2015). As very high or very low oxytocin concentrations have been 
predictive of depressive symptom severity 10 weeks later (Seay et al. 2014), and depressed 
individuals may experience greater oxytocin increases in response to affiliation relative to 
non-depressed individuals (Cyranowski et al., 2008), it is possible that measurement of 
oxytocin at the beginning of the visit (prior to ‘affiliation’) instead of at the end (following 
Massey et al.

 ‘affiliation’), could actually have resulted in finding an inverse relationship between 
oxytocin and PPD symptom severity.
Next, earlier investigations were drawn from different populations, with different individual 
histories of both adversity and social support across their lifespans. PPD symptoms were 
assessed at two weeks postpartum in the Skrundz study (2011) compared to assessment at 
six weeks postpartum in the current study. Women in the Eapen study (2014) were recruited 
for a larger study on separation anxiety whereas we specifically recruited healthy women not 
receiving any treatment for a psychiatric condition. In the Zelkowitz study (2014), while an 
inverse relationship between oxytocin and depressive symptoms was found in their high 
stress group, a direct relationship (high oxytocin—greater depressive symptom severity) was 
observed in the low stress group, which roughly mirrors the direct relationship found in our 
sample. In summary, our present findings are tentative, and support the value of studying the 
predictive value of oxytocin in this context of past MDD history.
Next, interpretations of the functional effects of oxytocin must take into account cross-
reactivity of oxytocin with other peptide receptors, including those for vasopressin (Albers 
2015). At high levels oxytocin might stimulate vasopressin receptors, with effects that are 
contradictory to those typically attributed to oxytocin (Carter 2014). We have previously 
found that high levels of oxytocin in the third trimester could be associated with a long or 
painful labor, possibly through actions on the vasopressin receptor, which may slow labor 
(Prevost et al. 2014). Thus, the relationship of higher third trimester oxytocin levels to 
greater PPD symptom severity among women with prior MDD history could have been 
mediated by the stimulation of vasopressin receptors and associated depression symptoms 
(Frank & Landgraf 2008).
Variation in methods, including extraction of samples and different antibodies used for 
measuring oxytocin are another possible source of differences across studies. For this 
reason, direct comparisons of hormone values across studies are challenging. Of note, mass 
spectrometry methods to determine the true values for oxytocin in human plasma have 
recently led to the discovery that oxytocin is in fact available in concentrations as high as 1 
ng/ml in human blood (Martin-Protean 2015) and that oxytocin is sequestered/bound to a 
variety of other molecules in plasma and in whole blood. Thus, assay methods that involve 
extraction, as well as separation of plasma from other components of blood, although 
recommended by some (Szeto et al. 2011; McCullough et al. 2013), greatly underestimate 
the levels of oxytocin in human blood. This putative carrier system might influence the 
presentation of the epitope (antibody binding site on the peptide), and explain differences 
among the values obtained with different antibodies.
A final factor that could contribute to discrepancies among studies is that different 
antibodies may recognize different forms of oxytocin. For example, in addition to the 
classical 9 amino acid form, these antibodies may recognize the 6 amino acid ring of 
oxytocin (tocinoic acid) or the precursor molecule, which contains 10-12 amino acids 
(Gainer 1982). As more reliable methods become available, individual differences in the 
oxytocin peptide and measures of receptor availability may offer new insights and more 
reliable methods for the prediction of vulnerability to postpartum depression.

 Limitations
While pregnancy, postpartum, and birth outcomes were not different between women with 
past MDD and women without, providing some support of the validity of findings, 
replication in a larger sample would be important. Next, depressive symptom severity was in 
the mild range, so it is unknown whether findings also apply to a broader range of depressive 
symptom severity. Finally, measures of the oxytocin receptor or the gene for this receptor 
were not available for the present study; these might have provided additional clues to 
individual genetic or epigenetic differences in the vulnerability to PPD (Bell et al. 2015).
Conclusions
Confirmation of our findings in larger more representative samples can contribute to a more 
in-depth understanding of the etiology of perinatal depression, and may lead to improved 
prediction of PPD. In the future, availability of an “objective” blood test could help to 
challenge misperceptions or stigma associated with depression by providing biological 
evidence about risk for this condition. In light of the far-reaching consequences of untreated 
PPD to women and their children, the ability to predict which individuals are at greatest risk 
for developing PPD before it manifests yields the exciting possibility for prevention.
