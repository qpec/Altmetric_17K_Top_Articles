Pain tolerance predicts human 
social network size
Katerina V.-A. Johnson & Robin I. M. Dunbar
Personal social network size exhibits considerable variation in the human population and is associated 
with both physical and mental health status. Much of this inter-individual variation in human sociality 
remains unexplained from a biological perspective. According to the brain opioid theory of social 
attachment, binding of the neuropeptide β-endorphin to μ-opioid receptors in the central nervous 
system (CNS) is a key neurochemical mechanism involved in social bonding, particularly amongst 
primates. We hypothesise that a positive association exists between activity of the μ-opioid system and 
the number of social relationships that an individual maintains. Given the powerful analgesic properties 
of β-endorphin, we tested this hypothesis using pain tolerance as an assay for activation of the 
endogenous μ-opioid system. We show that a simple measure of pain tolerance correlates with social 
network size in humans. Our results are in line with previous studies suggesting that μ-opioid receptor 
signalling has been elaborated beyond its basic function of pain modulation to play an important role 
in managing our social encounters. The neuroplasticity of the μ-opioid system is of future research 
interest, especially with respect to psychiatric disorders associated with symptoms of social withdrawal 
and anhedonia, both of which are strongly modulated by endogenous opioids.
The origin of societies is considered one of the major evolutionary transitions1. This has been accomplished by 
numerous species but arguably no society is as widespread, complex and technologically advanced as our own. 
The human brain has evolved to thrive in social environments, providing us with the cognitive processing power 
to deal with our dynamic and intricate personal relationships2. However, there is limited understanding of the 
neurobiological processes underpinning human sociality. A growing number of studies highlight the important 
role played by endogenous opioid peptides, most notably β 
-endorphin, in affiliation and bonding in social ani-
mals such as rodents and primates, including humans3,4. This neuropeptide is released from the CNS and has 
the highest binding affinity for μ 
-opioid receptors, which are widely distributed in the brain5. Upon binding, 
β 
-endorphin induces analgesia and a sense of well-being6,7. The brain opioid theory of social attachment8 postu-
lates that the endogenous μ 
-opioid system is fundamental to the establishment and maintenance of social bonds. 
Indeed, μ 
-opioid neurotransmission has been shown to modulate social motivation4 and plays a key role in attrib-
uting positive value to social interactions9. Specifically, the close relationship between the opioid and dopamine 
systems is integral to the rewarding nature of social interactions10.
Until relatively recently, experimental evidence supporting the role of the endogenous opioid system in mod-
ulating social behaviour mainly derived from the administration of opioids and opioid blockers3,11. For instance, 
humans given the μ 
-opioid antagonist naltrexone experience feelings of reduced social connection12. With 
advances in genetics, knockout technology has revealed that mice lacking the μ 
-opioid receptor gene show severe 
deficits in numerous facets of social behaviour, including interactions with conspecifics, communication and 
infant attachment13,14. Furthermore, there is increasing interest in the use of positron emission tomography (PET) 
scanning to measure activity of the μ 
-opioid system in relation to differences in social behaviour, both within 
individuals (Manninen et al. in prep) and between individuals15.
Since β 
-endorphin is a potent analgesic, indeed more so than the pain-relieving opiate drug morphine16, the 
primary hypothesis tested here was whether pain tolerance (as a proxy for activation of the μ 
-opioid system) pre-
dicts social network size. We tested this hypothesis in a population of healthy young adults (n = 
 101). The study 
involved a questionnaire relating to the two innermost social network layers (approximately corresponding to 
those individuals contacted at least once a week and once a month respectively), as well as collecting information 
on personality, sociodemographics and lifestyle. Since the blood-brain barrier is impermeable to β 
-endorphin, 
CNS endorphin levels can only be accurately determined by sampling cerebrospinal fluid3 via lumbar puncture,

whilst measuring the μ 
-opioid system directly requires the use of PET scanning17. Instead, pain tolerance was 
assessed by means of a non-invasive, physical pain test (see Methods).
Results
Multiple regression analysis (see Supplementary Tables S1–3) revealed pain tolerance to be a significant predictor 
of social network size (P = 
 0.010), in particular the size of an individual’s outer network layer (P = 
 0.002, Fig. 1). 
This corresponds to members of their network whom they are typically in contact with at least monthly but less 
frequently than once a week. The personality trait agreeableness also positively predicted network size but was 
negatively related to pain tolerance and thus proved not to mediate the above relationship (Supplementary Tables 
S4–6). Notably, there were no significant gender differences in pain test performance (t99 = 
 −1.144, P = 
 0.255). 
Since pain tolerance is inferred from the length of time participants can endure the physical pain test, individ-
uals with higher self-rated fitness performed significantly better, as anticipated (Supplementary Tables S4–6). 
However, fitter individuals also had smaller social networks, particularly the outer network layer (P = 
 0.021), 
and so fitness was not a confounding variable in the relationship between pain tolerance and network size. The 
analysis also revealed stress to be a significant negative predictor of outer social network size (P = 
 0.023), with 
individuals who reported higher stress levels having smaller networks.
Discussion
Our results show that pain tolerance positively predicts social network size. This therefore supports our hypoth-
esis that variation in the μ 
-opioid system underlies individual differences in sociality. These results are consistent 
with a recent PET imaging experiment demonstrating a correlation between μ 
-opioid receptor availability and 
attachment style, such that individuals showing greater avoidance of social attachment exhibit lower receptor 
densities15. Our findings are also in agreement with previous pain tolerance studies indirectly implicating the 
endogenous opioid system in human social bonding activities such as music-making18, dancing19 and laughter20. 
In addition, laughter has since been shown to correlate with elevated μ 
-opioid activity, as measured by PET scan-
ning (Manninen et al. in prep). This suggests that tests of pain tolerance like that used in our study may indeed 
serve as a useful proxy for assessing activation of the μ 
-opioid system.
Variation in μ 
-opioid receptor signalling may be due to underlying differences in both endogenous opioid 
release and receptor density, though their relative contribution is yet to be fully determined. However, stud-
ies of oxytocin and vasopressin signalling in rodents have shown that CNS receptor densities strongly mod-
ulate the influence of these neuropeptides, irrespective of neuropeptide abundance21. In fact, analyses of 
post-mortem brain tissue and in vivo PET studies in humans have revealed a broad range of μ 
-opioid receptor 
densities within the population, differing by at least 30–50%22. Such variation is likely to considerably affect the 
potency of β 
-endorphin11. Genetic studies suggest these differences in receptor density are partly the result of a 
non-synonymous single-nucleotide polymorphism in the μ 
-opioid receptor gene (OPRM1), substituting aspartic 
acid for asparagine (A118G)23. This functional polymorphism is relatively common in the population, with the 
minor G allele having a frequency of 10–30%24, and is associated with reduced μ 
-opioid receptor expression24,25. 
The G allele has also been linked to increased social withdrawal26 and reactivity to social rejection27, as well as 
Figure 1. Relationship between pain tolerance and social network size. Pain tolerance is a significant 
predictor of an individual’s social network size (P = 
 0.010), especially the size of their outer network layer 
(P = 
 0.002) as depicted here. This represents those individuals contacted at least monthly, but less frequently 
than once a week. Pain tolerance is plotted as the natural log transformation of pain test time and the reduced 
major axis regression line is shown.

greater pain sensitivity and reduced relief from opiate drugs28. This is therefore in line with our proposition that 
variation in the μ 
-opioid system contributes to individual differences in both social behaviour and pain tolerance.
We acknowledge that use of pain tolerance as a proxy for μ 
-opioid receptor signalling, rather than its direct 
measurement, represents a limitation of our research. However, the μ 
-opioid system is critically involved in pain 
modulation6,29 and numerous PET studies implicate μ 
-opioidergic activation in both experimental and clinical 
pain settings30. Most notably, in humans undergoing a sustained muscular pain challenge, individuals exhibiting 
higher activity of the μ 
-opioid system report reduced sensory and affective pain31. A possible future direction that 
would benefit research in this field would be to combine PET scanning with a range of different pain tests to deter-
mine how reliably they can predict activity of the μ 
-opioid system. We also recognise the possible involvement 
of non-opioid signalling pathways, especially given the complex neurochemistry underlying pain responses32,33. 
In particular, oxytocin, vasopressin and endocannabinoids are all implicated in social behaviour34,35, as well as 
having analgesic effects36–38. Indeed, it is likely that they act in concert with β 
-endorphin39–41.
Further research is required to understand the causality of this relationship between pain tolerance and net-
work size. It may be that individuals with genetic variants conferring enhanced μ 
-opioid neurotransmission 
derive greater reward from social interactions, thereby seeking more company. An alternative, though not mutu-
ally exclusive, explanation is that individuals leading lives rich in social interactions may release higher levels of 
endogenous opioids and/or have elevated receptor expression. However, we currently lack knowledge regarding 
the neuroplasticity exhibited by the μ 
-opioid system. This is of particular interest in relation to psychiatric dis-
orders. Indeed, healthy females asked to sustain a sad mood for only 30 minutes show a reduction in μ 
-opioid 
receptor activation42. Thus prolonged sadness, as experienced by those suffering from depression, may over time 
lead to a significant fall in opioidergic signalling. We hypothesise that reduced μ 
-opioid activity may characterise 
the onset of conditions such as depression and schizophrenia, resulting in the common symptoms of anhedonia 
and social withdrawal. Indeed, endogenous opioids mediate hedonic experiences and are integral to our feelings 
of social connection8,12. In support of this, there is evidence of compromised μ 
-opioid receptor signalling in 
patients suffering from depression and schizophrenia43,44 and studies using rodent models of depression also 
implicate the μ 
-opioid system45.
With respect to the other notable results of our analysis, fitness was primarily included in the regression model 
to account for its influence on pain tolerance but revealed an interesting and novel negative relationship with 
network size. This indicates a trade-off between leading a socially active versus a physically active life. Beyond the 
obvious constraint of time, this relationship may reflect our underlying neurobiology such that individuals who 
exercise more may have greater reliance on this method of promoting β 
-endorphin release, rather than through 
social interactions. Though exercise is frequently prescribed as a treatment for depression, perhaps focus should 
also be placed on strengthening and expanding an individual’s social ties.
The relationship reported here between stress and network size may reflect the beneficial effects of social 
support in dealing with stressful situations46, since measures of social support often correlate with social network 
size47. Interestingly, one study found that the number of Facebook friends (a known correlate of real-world social 
network size48) is associated with enhanced perceptions of social support and reduced stress49. Whether online 
social networks play a role in relieving stress (or even intensifying it) over and above an individual’s actual social 
interactions remains uncertain. However, an alternative interpretation of our data is that stressed individuals find 
less time for social engagement and thus their network decreases in size.
Understanding the biological causes of variation in social network size is of particular interest given the robust 
association between an individual’s social support and their health, ranging from functioning of their immune, 
endocrine and cardiovascular systems46 to myelin integrity50. Interestingly, it is an individual’s perceived level of 
social support that may often be a more reliable indicator of their health status46,51. Compared to other lifestyle 
factors, we have limited understanding of the mechanisms via which sociality influences morbidity and mor-
tality risk52, though reduced activation of the neuroendocrine stress response likely plays a significant role in 
both humans51,53 and animals54. Since β 
-endorphin is known to alleviate the stress response55 and protect against 
inflammation and cancer56, the activity of an individual’s endogenous μ 
-opioid system may have important con-
sequences for their health. However, such a direct interaction between social and somatic health is yet to be 
explored.
In summary, there is substantial evidence that μ 
-opioid neurotransmission influences sensitivity not only to 
our physical environment but also our social one. This study adds to previous research implicating the μ 
-opioid 
system as a key neural substrate upon which human sociality has evolved. A better understanding of the neurobi-
ological mechanisms underpinning our social lives is imperative, especially since our technology-driven world is 
rapidly changing the nature of social relationships and certainly outpacing any biological adaptations. Sociality is 
clearly of adaptive value to our species, yet in this digital era deficiencies in our social interactions may be one of 
the overlooked factors contributing to the declining health of our modern society.
Methods
Participants. 
The study was advertised for healthy adults aged 18–35 years, recruited predominantly from 
the University of Oxford. Exclusion criteria were recreational drug use or drug replacement therapy. Participants 
were requested not to consume alcohol (within 24 hours) or smoke (within 3 hours) prior to the study, given the 
analgesic properties of these substances.
The mean age of respondents was 21.7 years (range = 
 18–34 years). In total 107 subjects (30 males and 77 
females) took part in the study. Six data points were excluded from the analysis due to either questionnaire inade-
quacies or failure to perform the pain test correctly. The study was approved by the University of Oxford’s Medical 
Sciences Inter-Divisional Research Ethics Committee and the methods were carried out in accordance with the 
approved guidelines. All participants gave written informed consent.

Questionnaires. 
The social network questionnaire was designed to collect data relating to the two innermost 
layers of a participant’s social network, corresponding to those individuals contacted on a weekly and monthly 
basis respectively57. The 50-item IPIP (International Personality Item Pool) inventory58 was used to score indi-
viduals on each of the ‘Big-Five’ personality traits (openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness and 
neuroticism). Respondents also provided basic sociodemographic and health information, along with self-rated 
assessments of their fitness and stress levels.
Pain tolerance test. 
Given the invasive nature of PET imaging, pain tolerance is often used as a conven-
tional assay in studies of the endogenous opioid system18–20. Participants performed an isometric quadriceps 
exercise (commonly known as the wall sit test) which involves squatting against the wall with knees at a 90° angle 
and a straight back. They were asked to hold this position and endure the discomfort for as long as possible and 
the time was recorded to the nearest second. The main advantages of this pain test are that it is non-invasive, does 
not require any specialist equipment and is quick to conduct, with an average time of 113 s (range = 
 26–394 s).
Statistical analyses. 
Analyses were performed using R 3.2.3 software59 and all tests were conducted with 
an α 
 level of 0.05. The construction of general linear models was guided by the Akaike Information Criterion, 
incorporating pain tolerance, self-rated fitness, stress and agreeableness as predictors of network size. Where 
necessary the appropriate variables were transformed, including natural log transformation of the pain test times, 
such that model residuals were normally distributed (Shapiro-Wilk test, P > 
 0.05) and satisfied the assumption 
of homoscedasticity (non-constant variance test, P > 
 0.05). The relationship between pain tolerance and social 
network size was plotted using the reduced major axis regression line which minimises the sum of the product 
of residuals in both the x and y directions. Partial correlations between variables were also calculated and the 
absence of multicollinearity confirmed using variance inflation factors. For analysis involving comparison of 
means, Student’s two-sample t-test (two-tailed) was conducted.
