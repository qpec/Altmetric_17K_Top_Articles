BACKGROUND: Patients with prostate cancer and their providers face uncertainty as they consider adjuvant radiotherapy (ART) or sal-
vage radiotherapy (SRT) after undergoing radical prostatectomy. The authors prospectively evaluated the impact of the Decipher test,
which predicts metastasis risk after radical prostatectomy, on decision making for ART and SRT. METHODS: A total of 150 patients who
were considering ART and 115 who were considering SRT were enrolled. Providers submitted a management recommendation before
processing the Decipher test and again at the time of receipt of the test results. Patients completed validated surveys on prostate can-
cer (PCa)-specific decisional effectiveness and PCa-related anxiety. RESULTS: Before the Decipher test, observation was recommended
for 89% of patients considering ART and 58% of patients considering SRT. After Decipher testing, 18% (95% confidence interval [95%
CI], 12%-25%) of treatment recommendations changed in the ART arm, including 31% among high-risk patients; and 32% (95% CI, 24%-
42%) of management recommendations changed in the salvage arm, including 56% among high-risk patients. Decisional Conflict Scale
(DCS) scores were better after viewing Decipher test results (ART arm: median DCS before Decipher, 25 and after Decipher, 19
[P<.001]; SRT arm: median DCS before Decipher, 27 and after Decipher, 23 [P<.001]). PCa-specific anxiety changed after Decipher test-
ing; fear of PCa disease recurrence in the ART arm (P 5 .02) and PCa-specific anxiety in the SRT arm (P 5 .05) decreased significantly
among low-risk patients. Decipher results reported per 5% increase in 5-year metastasis probability were associated with the decision
to pursue ART (odds ratio, 1.48; 95% CI, 1.19-1.85) and SRT (odds ratio, 1.41; 95% CI, 1.09-1.81) in multivariable logistic regression analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: Knowledge of Decipher test results was associated with treatment decision making and improved decisional effective-
ness among men with PCa who were considering ART and SRT. Cancer 2017;123:2850-9. V

INTRODUCTION
The majority of cases of prostate cancer are indolent, with a low risk of lethality. However, cases with aggressive pathology
exhibit high rates of biochemical and clinical disease progression.1 Randomized controlled trials have demonstrated a
progression-free survival benefit for adjuvant radiotherapy (ART) for patients with aggressive pathology after radical pros-
tatectomy, defined by extracapsular extension, seminal vesicle invasion, or a positive surgical margin.2-4 However, the

 impact of ART on overall survival is less clear. Moreover,
RT in the early recovery trajectory after radical prostatec-
tomy may arrest the return of sexual and urinary function
and impose new bowel-related side effects.5 In addition,
the relative efficacy of immediate ART versus early salvage
RT (SRT) has not been rigorously tested in the clinical tri-
al setting. Because of these factors, many practitioners
defer ART. Nationally representative prostate cancer reg-
istry data suggest a limited uptake of ART for patients
with aggressive pathology at the time of radical prostatec-
tomy.6 Similarly, men with a rising prostate-specific anti-
gen (PSA) level after prostatectomy may benefit from
SRT.7 Nevertheless, although early SRT appears to
improve prostate cancer-specific outcomes,8 the PSA
threshold at which SRT is most beneficial is unknown.
This clinical environment is an ideal forum for bio-
markers that inform clinical decision making. The Deci-
pher test is a genomic classifier that predicts the 5-year
risk of clinical metastases after radical prostatectomy.9-13
Decipher evaluates the activity of genes in the tumor that
are shown to be involved in the progression of prostate
cancer by measuring the expression levels of 22 RNA fea-
tures involved in multiple biological pathways across the
genome
using
a
previously
locked
random
forest
algorithm.
We prospectively evaluated the impact of the Deci-
pher test on patient and provider decision making regard-
ing the adjuvant treatment of patients with aggressive
pathology or salvage treatment of patients with a rising
PSA after radical prostatectomy. We assessed the recom-
mended management from the treating provider, as well
as patient and provider decision effectiveness before and
after viewing the results of a Decipher test. We hypothe-
sized that information from the Decipher test would
result in changes in recommended treatment pursuant to
the Decipher risk category and with decreased decisional
conflict observed in patients and providers.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Participants
The current study was a multicenter, prospective study at
19 sites participating in the Society of Urologic Oncology
Clinical Trials Consortium. Patients were recruited from
May 2014 through February 2016. We used a 2-arm
cohort trial approach in which all patients received Deci-
pher testing (Fig. 1). Eligible patients had prostate cancer
that previously was treated with radical prostatectomy and
were being considered for either ART or SRT. The target
population
was
patients
with
clinicopathological
characteristics for whom the decision for ART or SRT was
not certain. Thus, we enrolled men with pathologically
non-organ-confined prostate cancer (ie, pathological clas-
sification of T3 disease, including men with extraprostatic
extension and/or seminal vesicle invasion) or positive sur-
gical margins into the ART arm. Patients who were eligi-
ble for ART were required to have undergone surgery
within the preceding 12 months before study enrollment.
Patients with a PSA increase or definite biochemical dis-
ease recurrence (BCR), defined as a PSA �0.2 ng/mL
with a confirmatory reading, were enrolled into the SRT
arm. Patients who were eligible for SRT were allowed to
have received adjuvant hormone therapy before their
BCR. Patients with metastatic disease were excluded.
Additional exclusions for both arms included failure of
PSA to nadir to �0.1 ng/mL within 3 months of surgery,
receipt of neoadjuvant androgen deprivation therapy
(ADT) or, for patients in the ART arm, the receipt of
adjuvant systemic therapy. There was no age restriction
for participation in the study.
Study Procedures
Included patients were not randomized; enrollment was
consecutive upon confirmation of eligibility. Stratifica-
tion was planned 1:1 for the ART and SRT arms. All
patient personal health information was blinded and all
patients provided informed consent. This study received
Institutional Review Board approval through Quorum
(#29292) and through Institutional Review Boards as
required by site practice. The study is registered on Clini-
calTrials.gov (PRO-IMPACT; ClinicalTrials.gov identi-
fier NCT02080689). Data were collected through an
electronic data capturing tool and monitored by a third-
party clinical research organization.
Eligible patients were enrolled between May 2014
and February 2016. Each patient was on study for 1 year.
Overall, 265 patients completed visit 1 and visit 2. The
intent of this interim report is to compare the treatment
recommendations without the Decipher test results (visit
1) with those made after reviewing the Decipher test
results (visit 2). This change in treatment recommenda-
tion is measured from observation to any treatment and
vice versa or from a treatment to a higher magnitude treat-
ment (eg, RT to RT with ADT). Visits 3 and 4 assess actu-
al treatment received and will be presented when full data
are available (Fig. 1).
During visit 1, a tumor specimen from the radical
prostatectomy was sent to GenomeDx Biosciences Inc
(San Diego, Calif). The recommended treatment based
on clinical variables and collected baseline demographic

 and clinical information was recorded. Decision effective-
ness using the Decisional Conflict Scale (DCS) for each
patient-provider pair and prostate cancer-specific anxiety
with the Memorial Anxiety Scale for Prostate Cancer
(MAX-PC) also was recorded. During visit 2, Decipher
test results were reviewed. The updated treatment recom-
mendation was recorded, and quality of life, decision
effectiveness, and prostate cancer-specific anxiety again
were assessed.
The patient DCS is a validated14 16-item instru-
ment that assesses overall decision conflict as well as sub-
domains of decision uncertainty: Feeling Informed,
Feeling That One’s Personal Values Have Been Clarified,
Feeling Supported in Decision Making, and Perception
of Effective Decision Making. The DCS is scored from 0
to 100, with higher scores indicating greater decisional
conflict. The provider-oriented DCS was the Provider
Decision Process Assessment Instrument,15,16 which is a
12-item survey that measures the level of confidence in a
treatment decision on a scale from 1 (“strongly agree”) to
5 (“strongly disagree”). Total DCS scores range from 12
to 60, with higher scores indicating greater decisional con-
flict or lower decision effectiveness.15 The modified 18-
item MAX-PC produces a summary score and also
includes 3 subscales: Prostate Cancer Anxiety, PSA Anxi-
ety, and Fear of Prostate Cancer Recurrence, with items
scored on a rating scale of 0 to 3.17,18 Individual items are
summed, with higher scores representing higher levels of
anxiety.18
Specimen Collection, Handling, and Decipher
Test Scoring
Radical prostatectomy specimens were graded by expert
genitourinary pathologists from originating institutions
using the International Society of Urological Pathology
(ISUP) 2005 Gleason grading criteria,19 and formalin-
fixed paraffin-embedded blocks were selected based on
the pathology report. Molecular analysis for Decipher
testing was based on the formalin-fixed paraffin-embed-
ded block containing the index prostate cancer lesion with
the highest stage and tumor grade, and samples were
obtained using a 1.5-mm tissue punch tool provided in
the specimen kit.
The Decipher score is based on the expression value
of 22 prespecified biomarkers, which are extracted from
the normalized data matrix and entered into a locked
model as described previously.9 The Decipher test results
were sent to the ordering providers and reported the
patient’s predicted 5-year probability of developing
metastasis after surgery. Decipher test results are grouped
into low-risk (<4%), intermediate-risk (4%-9%), and
high-risk (>9%) categories based on previously described
thresholds.11
Statistical Analysis
The protocol-defined primary objective of the current
study was to determine the extent to which use of the
Decipher test influences treatment recommendations
immediately after radical prostatectomy and at the time of
BCR. The primary endpoint was defined as any change in
treatment plan from before to after the Decipher report.
Although this interim report represents the study’s prima-
ry analysis, data collection is ongoing to determine the
consistency of the treatment plan with the actual treat-
ment received within 12 months of radical prostatectomy
or BCR.
The study protocol specified a sample size of 150
patients (150 patients after radical prostatectomy and 150
patients after BCR) to achieve a 2-sided 95% confidence
interval (95% CI) half-width <9% when accounting for
within-physician correlation (ie, multiple recommenda-
tions per physician) and assuming results similar to previ-
ous work.20,21
All statistical tests were 2-sided, and are reported
with a significance level of .05. Analyses were performed
in R statistical software (version 3.1; R Foundation, Vien-
na, Austria). All analyses and results were confirmed by a

 frequencies and percentages as appropriate. Treatment
recommendations were analyzed as stratified by Decipher
risk categories.22 Exact binomial CIs were constructed to
measure changes in treatment recommendations, before
and after the Decipher test results. The paired Wilcoxon
test was used to compare continuous scores on decisional
conflict and patient-reported anxiety. Univariable and
multivariable logistic regression models were constructed
to assess the association between Decipher test results and
treatment recommendations, independent of demograph-
ic and clinical variables. For these models, the response
variable was classified as observation (ie, no further thera-
py) versus treatment (ie, ART or SRT or systemic thera-
py). Results were corroborated by mixed-effect logistic
regression models to account for the potential correlation
of multiple patients seen by the same physician; results
were similar without changes in significance.
RESULTS
Between May 2014 and February 2016 (the enrollment
period), 159 and 125 patients, respectively, were enrolled
in the ART and SRT arms. Of these, 150 patients (94%)
and 114 patients (91%), respectively, completed the
before and after Decipher visits (visits 1 and 2). Nine
patients (6%) and 11 patients (9%), respectively, with-
drew due to tissue availability, loss to follow-up, protocol
deviations, or withdrawal of consent before completing
visit 2.
Patient Characteristics
Demographic, clinical, and pathological characteristics of
the study cohort are shown in Table 1. Approximately
one-half of the patients in the ART arm had positive sur-
gical margins and 67% had �pT3 prostate cancer; 47%
had pathological ISUP grade 3 to 5 (Gleason scores of 4
1 357 or 8-10). The median Decipher probability of
metastasis at 5 years after radical prostatectomy was 6.2%
(IQR, 2.4%-11.2%). Decipher testing classified 46.0%,
22.0%, and 32.0% of patients, respectively, into low-risk,
intermediate-risk, and high-risk groups.
In the SRT arm, 49% of patients had positive surgi-
cal margins and 43% had �pT3 prostate cancer; 49.5%
had pathological ISUP grade 3 to 5. The median Deci-
pher probability of metastasis at 5 years after radical pros-
tatectomy was 6.5% (IQR, 2.7%-14.4%). Overall,
Decipher testing classified 33.0%, 25.2%, and 41.7% of
patients, respectively, into low-risk, intermediate-risk,
and high-risk groups.
Treatment Recommendations
Before Decipher, observation was recommended for
88.7% of patients in the ART arm (133 patients) and
11.3% (17 patients) received a recommendation for ART

 (Table 2). Observation was recommended for 58.3% of
patients in the SRT arm (67 patients), and 32.2% (37
patients) received a recommendation for SRT and 9.6%
(11 patients) received a recommendation for either ADT
or SRT and ADT. After Decipher testing, we observed an
18% change (95% CI, 12%-25%; 27 patients) in treat-
ment recommendations in the ART arm and a 32%
change (95% CI, 24%-42%; 37 patients) in treatment
recommendations in the SRT arm.
Stratified by Decipher risk category, 91% (63
patients) and 96% (66 patients) of patients in the ART
arm and Decipher low-risk group were recommended to
undergo observation before and after the addition of
information from the Decipher test, respectively. Fewer
patients retained recommendations for observation after
the addition of information from the Decipher test in
both the intermediate-risk (79% [26 patients] before to
73% [24 patients] after receiving Decipher results) and
high-risk (92% [44 patients] before to 63% [30 patients]
after receiving Decipher results) groups. After Decipher,
37% (18 patients) of Decipher high-risk patients were rec-
ommended to receive more intense therapy (ART instead
of observation or ART and ADT instead of RT alone)
compared with 8% (4 patients) when only clinical and
pathological characteristics were considered (Fig. 2A).
Among patients in the SRT arm, 63% (24 patients)
and 74% (28 patients) of Decipher low-risk patients were
recommended to undergo observation before and after
Decipher testing, respectively. Observation recommenda-
tions increased for Decipher intermediate-risk patients as
well: 55% (16 patients) before Decipher and 59% (17
patients) after Decipher. After Decipher testing, 69% (33
patients) of Decipher high-risk patients were recommended
to receive more intense therapy (SRT instead of observation,
SRT and ADT instead of RT alone, or ADT) compared
with 44% of patients (21 patients) when only clinical and
pathological characteristics were considered (Fig. 2B).
Figure 3 displays changes in treatment recommen-
dations at intervals of Decipher probability of clinical
metastases 5 years after radical prostatectomy in the ART
(Figs. 3A and 3B) and SRT (Figs. 3C and 3D) arms.
Patients with higher probabilities of metastasis were more
often recommended more intense therapy (P<.001 for
both the ART and SRT arms).
Multivariable models assessing the independent
association between Decipher test results and a change in
treatment recommendation, adjusting for demographic,
clinical, and pathological variables, demonstrated a statis-
tically significant association between Decipher results
and treatment in both the ART and SRT arms (Table 3).
All other variables held constant: a 5% increase in the
Decipher 5-year probability of clinical metastases was
associated with significantly higher odds of ART (odds
ratio, 1.48; 95% CI, 1.19-1.85 [P<.001]) and SRT (odds
ratio, 1.41; 95% CI, 1.09-1.81 [P 5 .01]) versus
observation.
Decision Effectiveness
Among patients in both the ART and SRT arms, use of
the Decipher test was associated with decreased decisional
conflict overall (ART arm: median DCS before Decipher,
25 [IQR, 8-44] and median DCS after Decipher, 19
[IQR, 2-30] [P<.001]; and SRT: median DCS before
Decipher, 27 [IQR, 16-41] and median DCS after Deci-
pher, 23 [IQR, 4-30] [P<.001]) and improved decision
effectiveness in the DCS subdomains of Decisional
Uncertainty and Feeling Supported in Your Decision
(Table 4). Among providers, the decisional conflict

 exhibited a statistically significant decrease of similar mag-
nitude in both the ART (median DCS before Decipher,
32 [IQR, 28-36] and median DCS after Decipher, 28
[IQR, 23-34] [P<.001]) and SRT (median DCS before
Decipher, 33 [IQR, 26-36] and median DCS after Deci-
pher, 29 [IQR, 22-34] [P<.001]) arms.
Among patients in the ART arm whose treatment
recommendation did not change after Decipher, DCS
exhibited a statistically significant decrease in patients
(median DCS before Decipher, 25 [IQR, 6-43] and
median DCS after Decipher, 18 [IQR, 2-29] [P<.001])
and providers (median DCS before Decipher, 32 [IQR,
28-36] and median DCS after Decipher, 28 [IQR, 23-35]
[P<.001])
(see

1).
Changes in DCS were not significant for patients and pro-
viders among patients in the ART arm whose treatment
recommendation changed (see Supporting Information
Table 1).
Among patients in the SRT arm whose treatment
recommendation changed after Decipher testing, DCS
exhibited a statistically significant decrease in patients
(median DCS before Decipher, 25 [IQR, 16-50] and
median DCS after Decipher, 20 [IQR, 2-28] [P 5 .001])
and providers (median DCS before Decipher, 33 [IQR,
25-36] and median DCS after Decipher, 26 [IQR, 19-32]
[P<.001]) (see Supporting Information Table 1). Statisti-
cally significant changes in the DCS of patients and pro-
viders also were observed among patients in the SRT arm
whose treatment recommendations did not change after
Decipher (both P�.02) (see Supporting Information
Table 1).
Considering all patients, prostate cancer-specific

 Information Table 2). Among patients judged to be at
low risk by Decipher testing in the ART arm, anxiety
decreased in the majority of patients, and fear of prostate
cancer recurrence exhibited a statistically significant
decrease (P 5 .02). Among Decipher low-risk patients in
the SRT arm, anxiety decreased in the majority of
patients, and prostate cancer-specific anxiety exhibited a
marginally statistically significant decrease (P 5 .05).
Anxiety did not increase significantly among Decipher
high-risk patients.
DISCUSSION
Use of a genomic test that delineates a patient’s risk of
clinical metastasis after radical prostatectomy is associated
with changes in recommended adjuvant and salvage treat-
ment and improved decisional effectiveness. Treatment
recommendations were found to align with Decipher risk
category: Decipher low-risk patients were more likely to
receive recommendations for observation, whereas Deci-
pher high-risk patients were more likely to receive recom-
mendations for ART.
The magnitude of change in treatment recommen-
dations was more pronounced for men in the SRT arm of
the current study. This relates in part to the finding that
the default recommendation for men with adverse pathol-
ogy at the time of radical prostatectomy is observation.
Only 10% of men found to have adverse pathology on
prostatectomy were recommended for ART.
Although ART has been associated with improved
progression-free survival, the comparative effectiveness of
ART compared with early SRT is uncertain, and the
impact of ART on overall survival has not been established
to date. This may leave providers reluctant to pursue a clini-
cal course that may compromise functional recovery.23
The changes in treatment recommendations that we
observed in the current study were more pronounced
among men with higher risk Decipher scores suggesting a
higher genomic risk for clinical metastases. Decipher low-
risk patients were more likely to receive observation rec-
ommendations after use of the test. Decipher high-risk
patients were more likely to receive ART or SRT recom-
mendations or to receive recommendations for interven-
tions of a greater magnitude (eg, patients may receive a
recommendation for ART and ADT instead of ART
alone). The degree to which provider recommendations
changed was more pronounced among patients in the
SRT arm, which may reflect the differences in clinical sce-
narios. In the SRT arm, providers are confronted with
men whose prostate cancer has definitively recurred. In
the ART arm, patients are instead at a conceptual risk of a
future disease recurrence based on the adverse features of
their prostatectomy specimen.
Both clinical scenarios clearly present prostate cancer
care providers with decisional uncertainty. In both the
ART and SRT settings, providers had DCS scores >30,
reflecting substantial decisional conflict. Although use of
Decipher testing was associated with a statistically signifi-
cant reduction in DCS, the median DCS after Decipher
still was high, indicating residual decisional uncertainty.
Although we believe that Decipher has the potential to
improve clinical decision making for patients considering
ART and SRT, additional decision aids may be required
to clarify which patients are optimally selected for obser-
vation or additional therapy.

 This provider uncertainty likely impacts patient-
reported decisional conflict. A patient DCS score >25 is
considered to indicate clinically significant decisional con-
flict.24 Decipher testing was found to be associated with
reduced patient decisional conflict with notable reductions
in the subdomains of Decisional Uncertainty and Deci-
sional Support. Overall DCS scores as well as the Decision-
al Uncertainty and Decisional Support subscales decreased
from levels consistent with clinically significant decisional
conflict to scores considered to be nonsignificant.
It is interesting to note that the ART and SRT arms
exhibited inverse associations between DCS reductions
and whether the treatment recommendation changed
after use of the Decipher test. Among patients in the ART
arm, it appeared that Decipher testing most effectively
reassured patients and providers about observation.
Among patients in the SRT arm, Decipher testing reas-
sured patients and providers regarding the need to change
the treatment recommendation, which most commonly
meant pursuit of SRT. In both arms, anxiety was most
robustly and significantly decreased in men found to be
categorized as low risk by Decipher testing. In demon-
strating improved decisional effectiveness, we highlight
the impact of Decipher on patient-centered health out-
comes beyond clinical impact.
The current study has several limitations. First, we
are presenting interim data regarding treatment recom-
mendations, which may not correlate with the actual
treatment received. Final analysis of the current study will
identify treatments received within 12 months of Deci-
pher testing. Second, patients are their own controls; we
do not include a group unexposed to Decipher testing.
Patients who have additional time to consider their clini-
cal and pathological characteristics may have decisional
effectiveness changes parallel with the current study find-
ings. Third, patients in the SRT arm have heterogeneous
time since prostatectomy, which may influence treatment
recommendations
independent
of
Decipher
testing
results. Last, to the best of our knowledge, no genomic
test to date has been validated against a control to demon-
strate that use of the test improves prostate cancer-specific
outcomes.
Despite these limitations, we identified significant
associations between Decipher genomic testing and both
the treatment recommendations and decisional effective-
ness underlying those recommendations. Patients deter-
mined to be at low risk of metastasis by Decipher had
higher rates of observation recommendations and patients
determined to be at high risk of metastasis had higher rates
of ART and SRT recommendations. Decisional conflict
was lower after viewing Decipher test results for both
patient and providers. The Decipher test has the potential
to be an important adjunct to clinical decision making in
men with adverse pathology or a rising PSA after undergo-
ing radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer.
