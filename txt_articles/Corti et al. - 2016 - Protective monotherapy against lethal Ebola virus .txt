Ebola virus disease in humans is highly lethal, with case fatality rates ranging
from 25 to 90%. There is no licensed treatment or vaccine against the virus,
underscoring the need for efficacious countermeasures. We ascertained that a
human survivor of the 1995 Kikwit Ebola virus disease outbreak maintained
circulating antibodies against the Ebola virus surface glycoprotein for more than
a decade after infection. From this survivor we isolated monoclonal antibodies
(mAbs) that neutralize recent and previous outbreak variants of Ebola virus
and mediate antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity in vitro. Strikingly,
monotherapy with mAb114 protected macaques when given as late as 5 days
after challenge. Treatment with a single human mAb suggests that a simplified
therapeutic strategy for human Ebola infection may be possible.
E
bola virus disease (EVD) causes severe ill-
ness characterized by rapid onset of fever,
vomiting, diarrhea, and bleeding diathesis
(1, 2). The challenges of a large outbreak
and the failure of traditional quarantine
and contact-tracing measures (3, 4) to control
the 2014 West Africa outbreak highlight the ur-
gent need for therapies. The success in nonhuman
primates (NHP) of ZMapp—a cocktail of three
chimeric monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) derived
from immunized mice (5–7)—illustrated the poten-
tial of mAb therapies against EVD, and ZMapp is
currently being evaluated in human trials. To date,
efforts in NHP to simplify the ZMapp regimen to
contain fewer mAbs have not been successful (7).
We sought to isolate mAbs from human EVD
survivors, with the goal of identifying antibodies
that confer clinical protection either as single or
dual-combination agents.
We obtained blood from two survivors of the
1995 EVD outbreak in Kikwit, Democratic Repub-
lic of the Congo (8), 11 years after infection. To
determine whether the subjects retained circu-
lating antibodies against Ebola virus (EBOV) glyco-
protein (GP), we assessed GP-specific antibodies
by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)
(Fig. 1A) (9). The reciprocal 10% maximal binding
EC90 titer (the reciprocal dilution at which there is
a 90% decrease in antigen binding) for subject
1 (S1) was 2326, higher than control sera by more
than a factor of 10. Moreover, serum from the more
severely ill subject, S1, displayed potent virus-
neutralizing activity (Fig. 1B); this finding indi-
cates that S1maintainedserologicmemory against
EBOV GP more than a decade after infection and
suggested the potential for cloning immuno-
globulins with potent neutralizing activity from
S1’s memory B cells.
Therefore, we sorted memory B cells from S1’s
peripheral blood mononuclear cells and immor-
talized individual clones with Epstein-Barr virus
(10). Forty clone supernatants displayed a range
of GP binding (Fig. 1C); two of them, 100 and 114,

Fig. 1. Isolation of antigen-specific monoclonal antibodies from an Ebola virus dis-
ease survivor. (A) Plasma samples obtained from two human survivors, an uninfected
human donor, and a nonhuman primate (NHP) vaccinated against EBOV GP were
serially diluted and analyzed by GP ELISA, A450 (absorbance at 450 nm) (n = 1).
(B) Lentivirus particles expressing luciferase and bearing EBOV GP were incubated in
the presence of heat-inactivated serum for 1 hour before addition to human embryonic
kidney 293Tcells (HEK293T). Infection was determined by measuring relative lumines-
cence (RLU) after 3 days. Percent infectivity = [(RLU with serum)/(RLU without
serum)] × 100%, mean ± SD (n = 3, representative experiment shown). (C) Immor-
talized B cell supernatants isolated from subject S1 were screened by EBOV GP ELISA,
A450 (n = 1). (D) Immortalized B cell supernatants from (C) were diluted 1:50, incu-
bated with lentivirus particles, and infection determined as in (B). Percent infectivity =
[(RLU with supernatant)/(RLU without supernatant)] × 100% (n = 1).

 expressed antibodies with markedly higher neu-
tralizing activity than all others (Fig. 1D). A sec-
ond immortalization yielded 21 clones, from which
the GP-specific clones 165 and 166 were rescued
(fig. S1).
mAb100, mAb114, mAb165, and mAb166 se-
quences were amplified by polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) and antibodies produced by tran-
sient transfection. We assessed ELISA binding to
EBOV GP and observed that mAb114, mAb165,
and mAb166 displayed maximal binding nearly
50% higher than that of KZ52, a prototypic EBOV
GP–specific human mAb (11), and 25% higher
than that of 13C6, a component of the ZMapp
cocktail (6, 7) (Fig. 2A). The binding curve of
mAb100 had a plateau similar to that of KZ52 (Fig.
2A). mAb100 and mAb114 achieved half-maximal
binding (EC50) at a concentration of 0.02 mg/ml,
which is lower than the other mAbs by a factor of
7 to 19. The binding profiles of mAb165 and mAb166
were similar to each other, with EC50 values of
0.38 mg/ml and 0.35 mg/ml, respectively; EBOV
control mAbs KZ52 and 13C6 had EC50 values of
0.33 mg/ml and 0.14 mg/ml, respectively (Fig. 2A).
To evaluate the four S1 mAbs’ capacity for
neutralization, we used lentiviral particles pseu-
dotyped with EBOV GP, a method that has been
demonstrated to recapitulate wild-type EBOV re-
sults without the need for high-level biocontain-
ment procedures (12) (Fig. 2B and fig. S2A).
mAb165 and mAb166 exhibited similar half-
maximal inhibition (IC50) concentrations of 1.77
and 0.86 mg/ml, respectively. mAb100 and mAb114
were the most potent, with IC50 values about one
log unit lower (0.06 and 0.09 mg/ml, respectively)
than those of mAb165 and mAb166. Notably, all
four of the isolated mAbs inhibited 100% of the
virus, unlike KZ52, which consistently displayed
only 80 to 90% maximum inhibition, and 13C6,
which neutralized <20% at 10 mg/ml. The S1
mAbs also potently neutralized the 2014 West
African Makona variant (fig. S2B). Neutralization
of wild-type EBOV particles by each of the iso-
lated antibodies was confirmed by plaque reduc-
tion assay (fig. S3).
Sequence analysis revealed that the S1 mAbs
displayed 85 to 95% germline identity for heavy
chains and 89 to 97% germline identity for light
chains (Fig. 2C). Analyses of germline gene usage
and V(D)J recombination indicate that they orig-
inated from different B cell lineages. We analyzed
the role of somatic hypermutations for the two
most potent antibodies, mAb100 and mAb114,
with the use of variants that were partially or
completely reverted to the unmutated common
ancestors (UCAs) (Fig. 2D and fig. S4, A and B).
The fully reverted mAb100 (UCA/UCA), as well
as a variant with a single change from the UCA
VL (UCA/gL, Ala89 → Thr), recognized cells ex-
pressing GP, with binding weaker than that of
the fully matured antibody by a factor of 2 to 4
(Fig. 2E and fig. S4, A and B). When three HCDR3
(heavy chain complementarity-determining re-
gion 3) mutations—Ala96 → Val, Val103 → Tyr,
and Tyr114 → Ser—were introduced in the reverted
germline antibody (gH/UCA), binding was com-
parable to the fully matured mAb100 (sH/sL);
this result suggests that three mutations are suf-
ficient to confer the binding observed for the fully
matured mAb100.
In the case of mAb114, the fully reverted ver-
sion (UCA/UCA) demonstrated negligible binding

 to GP (Fig. 2F and fig. S4, C and D). Introduction
of two mutations (Ala96 → Val and Tyr108 → Ser)
in the HCDR3 of the mAb114 germline (gH/UCA)
was sufficient to confer an increase in binding,
although still not to the degree seen with the fully
matured mAb. Because these mutations are lo-
cated at the base of the HCDR3 loop, they likely
do not make direct contact with GP and thus may
have a stabilizing effect on the whole HCDR3.
The fully matured light chain and the two HCDR3
mutations (gH/sL) were sufficient to confer bind-
ing equivalent to the fully matured mAb (sH/sL).
The fully mutated light chain gene (UCA/sL) could
partially compensate for a lack of somatic muta-
tion in the heavy chain (Fig. 2F and fig. S4, C and
D). The presence of additional mutations on ei-
ther VH or VL is required to achieve the level of
the fully matured mAb114 binding. These results
suggest a rapid pathway of mAb114 affinity matu-
ration through one or two somatic mutations,
which became redundant as further mutations
accumulated—a finding that is reminiscent of
what was recently observed for the generation of
broadly neutralizing influenza antibodies (13).
Because mAb100 and mAb114 were the most
potently neutralizing antibodies, they were consid-
ered optimal candidates for further evaluation
in NHP. To assess the potential for combination
therapy, we first sought to rule out antagonistic
binding to GP. We found that each antibody bound
to GP in the presence of the other, which suggests
that they recognize distinct regions on GP (Fig. 3A)
and therefore could be used as combination im-
munotherapy to maximize efficacy (14). To de-
fine the regions targeted by mAb100 and mAb114,
we used biolayer interferometry to assess GP bind-
ing in competition with mAbs KZ52 and 13C6,
which have epitopes in the GP base and glycan
cap, respectively (15, 16). We found that mAb100
competes with KZ52 for binding at the base of
GP, whereas mAb114 recognizes (at least in part)
the glycan cap region, as demonstrated by com-
petition with 13C6 (Fig. 3, B and C).
Because some EBOV GP antibodies have been
suggested to mediate antibody-dependent cell-
mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) (17), we determined
the ADCC activity of mAb100 and mAb114 in a
flow cytometric assay (Fig. 3D). We found that
mAb100 and mAb114 mediated ADCC, with max-
imal activity observed at a mAb concentration
of 0.03 mg/ml. Target cell killing was mediated
through Fc receptors, because mAbs containing
Fc LALA mutations [Leu234 → Ala, Leu235 → Ala
(18)] abrogated ADCC activity. Therefore, these
mAbs have the potential to induce direct killing
of infected cells in vivo, a key viral clearance
mechanism.
The presence of potent neutralizing and ADCC
activity and the absence of cross-competition sup-
ported testing whether mAb100 and mAb114
offered in vivo protective efficacy. We challenged
four rhesus macaques with a lethal dose of EBOV.
One day after challenge, the treatment group
(n = 3) received an intravenous injection with a
mixture of mAb100 and mAb114 at a combined
dose of 50 mg/kg, and the treatment was repeated
twice at 24-hour intervals. Circulating GP-specific
antibody titers in mAb recipients peaked after
the second injection, and reciprocal ELISA titers
remained above 105 throughoutthe study, suggest-
ing minimal clearance of the mAbs (Fig. 4A). The
untreated macaque succumbed to EVD on day 10
with a circulating viral load exceeding 108 ge-
nome equivalents per milliliter (ge/ml) (Fig. 4, B
and C). In contrast, all three mAb-treated ma-
caques survived challenge without detectable
viremia. Consistent with historical controls, the
untreated animal displayed hallmark indica-
tors of EVD including thrombocytopenia and
elevations in alanine transaminase and creat-
inine from day 6 through the time of death
(Fig. 4D and figs. S5 to S8). In contrast, the
treatment group remained within normal ranges
for these parameters and remained free of all
EVD symptoms.
We next asked whether monotherapy is suffi-
cient for protection, focusing on mAb114 because
it showed higher maximal binding than mAb100.
We exposed four macaques to a lethal dose of
EBOV and administered mAb114 (50 mg/kg; n =
3) to the treatment group after a 1-day delay, fol-
lowed by two doses at 24-hour intervals. All treated
macaques survived, whereas the control animal
succumbed to EVD on day 6 with a peak viral
load of 1010 ge/ml (Fig. 4, E to G). In contrast to
the previous experiment, transient viremia was
observed in the treated animals (Fig. 4F) but

 remained at levels less than 0.1% of the untreated
control animal. Despite transient viremia, treated
animals remained free of clinical and laboratory
abnormalities (Fig. 4H and figs. S9 to S12).
Because a delay in treatment is a distinct pos-
sibility in an outbreak setting, we evaluated the
therapeutic potential for mAb114 when treat-
ment was delayed until 5 days after lethal EBOV
challenge. All three animals in the treatment
group survived, while the control animal suc-
cumbed to EVD on day 9. Moreover, animals
in the treatment group remained symptom-free
and protected against thrombocytopenia, tran-
saminitis, and renal dysfunction (Fig. 4I and
figs. S13 to S16).
mAb114 has several characteristics that may
contribute to protection as a monotherapy when
compared to KZ52 and 13C6, which were non-
protective in NHPs (7, 19). First, although KZ52
and mAb114 potently neutralize EBOV in vitro,
only mAb114 completely neutralizes input virus.
Second, mAb114 does not require complement
for neutralizing activity (Fig. 2B), in contrast to
13C6 (6). One hypothesis that might be derived
from these observations is that protective mono-
therapy may require both potent binding and
completecomplement-independentneutralization.
In addition, mAb114’s specific mechanism of neu-
tralization [which targets an essential step in virus
entry (20)] and observed in vitro ADCC activity
maycontributetomAb114’sabilitytoprotectagainst
lethal EVD in macaques.
Our results show that antibodies as well as
memory B cells specific to EBOV are maintained
in a survivor more than a decade after infection.
For the mAbs isolated from this survivor, a po-
tential role for antibody-dependent killing is sug-
gested by in vitro ADCC activity that in vivo may
be mediated by multiple effector cells such as
natural killer cells, macrophages, or neutrophils.
In addition, these mAbs showed potent neutral-
izing activity against Ebola GP variants that have
evolved over a 40-year period. Together, these
data demonstrate the therapeutic potential of
these mAbs as dual-combination therapy and/or
monotherapy and contribute to understanding
the mechanisms of antibody-mediated protection
against Ebola virus disease.
