ABSTRACT: According to the American skin cancer foundation, there are more new cases of 
skin cancer than the combined incidence of cancers of the breast, prostate, lung and colon each 
year and malignant melanoma represents its deadliest form. About 50% of all cases are 
characterized by a particular mutation BRAFV600E in the BRAF-gene. Recently developed highly 
specific drugs are able to fight BRAFV600E mutated tumors, but require diagnostic tools for fast 
and reliable mutation detection to warrant treatment efficiency. We completed a preliminary 
clinical trial applying cantilever array sensors to demonstrate identification of a BRAFV600E 
single-point mutation using total RNA obtained from biopsies of metastatic melanoma of diverse 
  
2 
sources (surgical material either frozen or fixated with formalin and embedded in paraffin). The 
method is faster than the standard Sanger or pyrosequencing methods and comparably sensitive 
as next-generation sequencing. Processing time from biopsy to diagnosis is below one day and 
does not require PCR-amplification, sequencing and labels.  
Cancer is the number one cause of death worldwide surpassing cardiovascular disease or all 
strokes1. The most common malignancy in humans is skin cancer2. The occurrence of cutaneous 
malignant melanoma has steadily increased over the past 50 years in fair-skinned populations 
and still grows in many developed countries as a result of changing sun-seeking behavior. Only 
up to 5% of all skin cancers are malignant melanomas, but are responsible for almost all 
fatalities. However, recently novel treatment methods have been developed. They are based on 
compounds with high specificity that have initiated stratified healthcare therapies by targeting 
particular driver mutations in various genes, e.g. BRAF inhibitors like vemurafenib for patients 
with BRAFV600E mutated tumors3,4. In combination with new mitogen-activated protein kinase 
kinase (MAP2K, MEK, MAPKK) inhibitors such as cobimetinib5 life expectancy can be 
extended to about one year6 with fewer side effects than the standard chemotherapeutic drug 
dacarbazine. The current gold standard for mutation screening in malignant tumors uses real-
time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing methods for DNA extracted from 
biopsies. Our method neither needs PCR, nor labelling, nor sequencing. PCR protocols can be 
error-prone with false positives as a particular hazard. Artifacts complicate protocols7 and extend 
processing time. We use an array of nanomechanical microcantilevers for surface stress sensing 
based on atomic force microscopy8 to analyze DNA/DNA hybridization9-12. The technique was 
further adapted to reveal antigen/antibody13,14, transcription factor/DNA interactions15 and effects 
of antibiotics on bacteria16. The platform also proved applicability to study transcriptional 
  
3 
activity of genes17,18 and is able to characterize function of transmembrane protein activity19. 
Here, we report on the detection of the BRAFV600E mutation present in a subset of 50-60% 
malignant melanomas in human biopsies at the RNA level. We chose to use RNA since more 
RNA transcripts occur in the cytoplasm than genomic DNA counterparts. Moreover, RNA/DNA 
heterodimers have a higher thermodynamic stability than DNA/DNA homodimers. The hybrid 
double helix shows an increased hydrodynamic radius (DNA/DNA 1.07 ±0.03 nm vs. 
RNA/DNA 1.27 ±0.03 nm)20, which should result in a higher stress on the cantilever's surface 
due to steric hindrance, thereby increasing the sensitivity of the technique. Different 
oligonucleotides were designed to uniquely recognize the altered BRAF sequence. Searching the 
human genome expressed sequence tags database21 an 18 base sequence was chosen to detect 
unambiguously the BRAF mRNA transcript. Our array sensor device facilitates addressing other 
mutations such as BRAFV600K for a more thorough investigation of tumors. 
The working principle of nanomechanical microcantilever biosensors is depicted in a 
schematic way in Figure 1a and in an experimental setup in supporting information, Figure S1. A 
self-assembled monolayer (SAM) of thiol-modified probe oligonucleotides (Supporting 
information Table S1) is covalently bound to gold-coated surfaces of the cantilevers. Upon 
hybridization with target oligonucleotides, bending of cantilevers is observed due to steric and 
ionic repulsion forces. Initial experiments to determine optimized hybridization conditions were 
performed (Supporting information Figure S2) in order to estimate the lowest ratio of mutant to 
wild type BRAF RNA (Figure 1b) required to conclusively identify the mutation by measuring 
various ratios.

Figure 1. Schematic of a cantilever array demonstrating surface modifications for the detection 
of BRAF RNA. (a) Steps: 1. coating 8 cantilevers with Ti (adhesion layer) and Au for 
functionalization with thiols; 2. adsorption of oligonucleotides for mutation recognition (site of 
mutation shown in red), wild type detection as a control (wild type site in green) or as non-
specific reference (polyAC; pink); 3. Experiment: total RNA injection containing complementary 
target sequences. Light blue indicates non-related sequences. The probe cantilevers will bend on 
hybridization depending on the presence of the mutation or the wild type or both, yielding a 
differential deflection Dx. All measurements must be done in a differential way to get reliable 
results, allowing to exclude undesired influences from temperature and non-specific adsorption. 
(b) Assessing the minimum RNA concentration for BRAFV600E detection using samples from cell 
lines: Various ratios of SK-Mel-37 BRAFV600E positive to T618A BRAFV600E negative total RNA 
(0%, 5%, 20% and 100%) have been used. We superimposed Langmuir isotherms (R2 > 0.94) on 
top of the data including the first 20 minutes dominated by mixing effects. The inset shows that 
the extrapolated differential deflections scale with the SK-Mel-37 concentrations.

The following two melanoma cell lines were selected (Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, 
Univ. Lausanne): T618A carrying wild type BRAF and SK-Mel-37 carrying BRAFV600E. The 
T618A line expresses a wild type form of BRAF, whereas the SK-Mel-37 line expresses the 
BRAFV600E mutant, and - to a lower extent - the wild type allele. Samples of total RNA obtained 
from two melanoma cell lines were mixed at different ratios and injected into the measurement 
chamber at a concentration of 20 ng/µl. The lowest ratio of 5% mutant in total wild type RNA 
turned out to be sufficient to identify the mutation in total RNA extracted from cell lines. A 
fraction of 5% is comparable to the amount other current methods require such as the COBAS 
test22 and represents a 4-fold improvement over standard PCR/sequencing.   
Having established the conditions for BRAFV600E detection in different cell lines, the next step 
is to extend the investigation to biopsies of melanoma patients by performing a clinical pilot 
study comprising 9 patients (Pathology Department of the University Hospital Basel). Two 
representative measurements are shown from BRAFV600E positive (Figure 2a) and from BRAFV600E 
negative (Figure 2b) melanoma biopsies. Melanoma tumors can be very heterogeneous with 
respect to their tumor cell expression profiles23 and may contain variable levels of normal cells 
(Table 1). We obtained a large signal of -15 mN/m (red curve) in a BRAFV600E positive tumor 
biopsy (Figure 2a) in contrast to a small signal of +3.0 mN/m in a BRAFV600E negative tumor 
biopsy (Figure 2b). A large response (red curve) of the BRAFV600E detecting cantilever is a clear 
indicator for the presence of the BRAFV600E mutation, whereas the green curve does not 
interrogate BRAFV600E. We observed a substantial signal of -25mN/m for wild type BRAF (green 
curve) as the BRAFV600E positive melanoma also expresses the wild type allele to a large extent. 
Therefore, the presence of BRAFV600E is unambiguously verified in the BRAFV600E positive tumor 
biopsy sample. We performed 9 analyses on human malignant melanoma biopsies (Biopsy_1 - 
  
6 
Biopsy_9), as well as 21 analyses on tissue cultures (TC) BRAFV600E positive (10 samples, 
labelled TC_1 – TC_10) and negative cell lines (11 samples, labelled TC_11 – TC_21). Samples 
originated from formaldehyde-fixed, paraffin-embedded, FFPE, and frozen tissues. 
 
 
Figure 2. RNA samples from two biopsies are investigated. The red curve represents the 
difference of responses between mutant probe (mt) and polyAC reference cantilever (ref) 
implying presence of BRAFV600E. The green curve shows a combination of wt reference and 
polyAC reference cantilevers indicating wild type BRAF. (a) BRAFV600E positive Biopsy_7 
exhibiting a non zero signal (red curve). (b) BRAFV600E negative Biopsy_5 showing a signal 
around zero in the red curve (for biopsy numbers and origin see Table 1). Langmuir fits (R2 > 
0.95) are superimposed on top of the data.

characterized by next generation sequencing (Biopsy_2, Biopsy_4, and Biopsy_8). 
 
We processed the data in a hierarchical cluster analysis (Figure 3 and Methods in supporting 
information) and were able to distinguish results obtained on cell lines and clinical samples (with 
the mutation in red and without the mutation in green). The dendrogram (tree structure) 
calculated using the method of Euclidian distances shows a bifurcation that reveals two main 
clusters representing mutant and wild type samples in both cell lines and clinical samples. The 
BRAFV600E positive biopsies are clearly part of the mutation cluster and the BRAFV600E negative 
biopsies are part of the wild type cluster, manifesting the single point mutation sensitivity of our 
method. The fact that BRAFV600E biopsies and the different preparations of tissue culture samples 
bifurcate earlier (*) than the wild type biopsies and the corresponding tissue culture preparations 
do (**), reflects a higher variability in the biopsies. The BRAFV600E positive biopsies are part of 
two different branches of the bifurcation (*). Biopsy_1 and Biopsy_7 are part of one branch,

whereas Biopsy_6 and Biopsy_9 are members of the second branch. In contrast, the majority of 
the wild type biopsies including Biopsy_3, 8, 4, 5 belong to the same branch of bifurcation (**), 
and only Biopsy_2 is member of the other branch. These findings point towards a genetically 
more heterogeneous nature of the BRAFV600E biopsies and tissue culture samples as compared to 
the BRAF wild type biopsies and tissue cultures.  A probable explanation is that different 
expression levels in the various samples influence the differential deflection signals. For 
comparison of our observations with the histological and sequencing findings we compiled Table 
1 showing the state, origin and type of biopsies. Our results agree with those obtained with 
standard methods of amplification and sequencing. In addition, our method provides high 
sensitivity requiring only 5% of cancer cells in the sample containing the BRAFV600E mutation and 
is comparable to the most sensitive sequencing methods currently in use. 
 
Figure 3. Hierarchical cluster analysis including 10 BRAFV600E positive tissue culture samples 
(TC_1 –TC_10, red), 11 BRAFV600E negative tissue culture samples (TC_11 – TC_21, green) and 
9 biopsies (Biopsy_1 – Biopsy_9). The BRAFV600E positive biopsies 1, 6, 7, and 9 (red) are clearly 
distinguished from the BRAFV600E negative 2, 3, 4, 5, and 8 biopsies (green).

Our method is capable of a more detailed mutation analysis. BRAFV600K is another less frequent 
mutation present in 10% of incidences. BRAFV600K oligonucleotide targets allow to distinguish 
the BRAFV600E and BRAFV600K mutations. Exposing the corresponding cantilevers to BRAFV600K 
complements results in bending (Figure 4a), whereas the BRAFV600E cantilevers respond in the 
corresponding experiment with BRAFV600E complement (Figure 4b), emphasizing mutation 
discrimination. These experiments support the specificity of the assay and show the versatility of 
the cantilever array in investigating relevant multiple mutations simultaneously. The method 
does neither require PCR sample amplification nor labelling due to the fact that total RNA is 
used. Faster recognition of multiple mutations is achived using parallel measurements owing to 
microcantilever arrays. 
 
Figure 4. Analysis of BRAFV600K mutation using BRAFV600K and BRAFV600E complement 
oligonucleotides. Microcantilevers were functionalized with BRAFV600K, BRAFV600E and 
polyAC oligonucleotide. Shown in red: response difference between mutant BRAFV600K and 
polyAC reference. Shown in green: response difference between mutant BRAFV600E and 
polyAC reference. Smooth lines represent Langmuir fits (R2 > 0.95). (a) injection of 100 nM 
BRAFV600K complement and (b) 100 nM BRAFV600E complement.

The proposed method has the following advantages: 1. neither PCR sample amplification nor 
labelling is necessary due to the fact that total RNA is employed; 2. the technique avoids costly 
sample preparation steps and 3. the array format allows parallel simultaneous interrogation of 
multiple targetable mutations for an efficient analysis in one assay; 4. both fresh and routine 
paraffin embedded tissue (a single 20 µm thick slice) may be used; 5. high sensitivity equivalent 
to the current sequencing technologies. 
Here, the aim was to study BRAF mutations in melanoma. However, nanomechanical 
cantilevers may also be used for the detection of any point mutation, like BRCA1 and BRCA2 
gene mutations in breast cancer. Another important breast cancer marker that is used to make 
treatment decisions is HER2. The HER2 gene is amplified which results in multiple copies of the 
gene as well as in increased expression of the HER2 protein. In a preliminary study, we already 
detected the amplified gene using specific oligonucleotide probes to demonstrate the versatility 
of our method.  Moreover, protein overexpression is likely to be assessed using specific 
antibodies, reducing two different detection methods into one single microcantilever based assay. 
Gene mutation and protein expression analysis is also applicable to CRISPR/CAS9 gene editing, 
as insertions and deletions down to single point mutations can be easily verified, underlining the 
potential of the microcantilever technology.

A microfabricated array of eight identical silicon cantilevers with a pitch of 250 µm, a length 
of 500 µm, a width of 100 µm, a thickness of 1 µm and a spring constant of 0.02 N/m were 
provided by the Micro-and Nanomechanics group at the IBM Research GmbH. The cantilever 
arrays were cleaned using an UV/Ozone cleaner (Jelight Company, Inc. Laguna Hills, 
California). Thiolated oligonucleotides (Microsynth AG, Balgach, Switzerland) were treated 
with 1 mM TCEP (Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine, Sigma-Aldrich Chemie, Buchs, Switzerland) 
thereby reducing disulfide bonds to ensure efficient self-assembled monolayer formation. 
Functionalization was carried out at a concentration of 40 µM thiolated oligonucleotide in 50 
mM TEAA buffer (triethyl ammonium acetate, Fluka, Buchs, Switzerland) using an MD-P-705-
L inkjet dispensing system (Microdrop, Norderstedt, Germany). Afterwards the array was 
washed once with water and in buffer and mounted in the 15 µl volume measurement chamber. 
Samples were injected at 10 µl/min. Total RNA was extracted from tissue culture samples and 
biopsies using standard methods. The deflection signal in nm can be converted into a surface 
stress in mN/m using Stoney’s equation and Sader’s correction1 with a Young’s modulus of 
1.2 x 1011 Pa for silicon, a cantilever thickness of  0.5 x 10−6 m and a Poisson ratio of  0.25.  
RNA purification from cell cultures: Total RNA was extracted using Trizol reagent (In 
vitrogen) following manufacturer’s instructions. RNA was further purified by ammonium 
acetate/ethanol precipitation and dissolved in DEPC-treated H2O. 
 RNA purification from FFPE tissue: A 20 μm section was cut from each FFPE (formalin-fixed 
paraffin-embedded) block and collected in a tube. The sections were deparaffinized by two rinses 
in xylene. After paraffin solubilization, the tissue was rinsed twice in 100% ethanol and collected 
by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min. Alcohol was aspirated and the tissue pellets were 
resuspended in 480 μl of digestion buffer (Lysis buffer: 45 ml H2O distilled + 5 ml 10X PCR 
  
4 
Buffer_AmpliGoldTaq + 50 μl ATL_Qiagen) and 20 μl of proteinase K (Promega 20 mg/ml) 
were added. Sections were incubated at 56°C overnight. Prior to RNA purification we 
inactivated proteinase K at 95°C for 10 min. Subsequently 1 ml of TRIzol® Reagent (Ambion 
Catalog number: 15596-026) was added per tube. The solution was vortexed and incubated at 
room temperature for 5 min. 1 μl of Glycogen (ThermoFisher Catalog number: R0551) was 
added to improve the RNA recovery, followed by 200 μL of BCP (Phase Separation Reagent 
MRC Catalog number: BP151). Each tube was vortexed vigorously for 30 sec and allowed to sit 
at room temperature for 3 min. Phase separation was achieved by centrifuging the sample at 
12,000 × g for 15 min at 4°C. After centrifugation, the aqueous phase (containing the RNA) 
was carefully transferred to a new 1.5 ml Eppendorf Tube. The RNA from the aqueous phase 
was precipitated by mixing with 0.6 ml of isopropanol (99,9% pure) and stored at -20°C for 30 
min. After that the sample was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 30 min at 4°C. At this point the 
supernatant was removed and the RNA pellet was washed in 75% ethanol by vortexing. A final 
centrifugation step at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C was performed. The ethanol was removed and 
the RNA pellet was briefly air-dried for 5 min. The RNA was re-suspended in 50 μl of RNase-
free water (DEPC treatment) and incubated for 10 min at 60°C. RNA purity and concentration 
were determined by the absorbance at 260 nm (A260) and 280 nm (A280) using NanoDrop ND-
2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA). 
 
For experiments using total RNA from cell culture and melanoma tissue samples were diluted 
to 20 ng/µl in a 0.13 × SSC buffer equalling 20mM NaCl.

Cantilevers were functionalized with corresponding 18mer probe thiol oligonucleotides (Table 
S1) and a 18mer reference oligonucleotide (polyAC). Initial experiments investigated optimal 
hybridization conditions and minimum concentrations for the detection of the mutation in total 
RNA extracted from biopsies. The most efficient hybridization temperature where only binding 
of BRAFV600E mutant to the mutant BRAFV600E oligonucleotide occurs was evaluated (Figure 
S1). The experiments were based on theoretical estimates of the melting temperature and salt 
concentration for the BRAFV600E oligonucleotide (36.8 ±1.2 °C in 20mM NaCl). 36 °C and a 
saline sodium citrate (SSC) buffer containing 20mM NaCl turned out to be the most promising 
hybridization condition with the highest specificity. Whereas at 34 °C the BRAFV600E signal is 
higher, we observe also a higher nonspecific wild type BRAF binding signal corresponding to 
  
6 
77% of the BRAFV600E signal.  No binding to the wild type reference by the mutated 
oligonucleotide is observed at 36 °C. At 38 °C the BRAFV600E signal is diminished by 44% and at 
40 °C is less than 10% of the signal at 36 °C. These studies suggest choosing 36 °C as the 
optimized temperature for the binding experiments. 
 
Data analysis was done using OriginPro 2015 (OriginLab Corporation, Northampton, MA 
01060, USA). Data were flattened using the locally weighted scatterplot smoothing (LOWESS) 
function and then a Langmuir function was fitted to the smoothed data. The dendrogram was 
computed using the hierarchical cluster analysis tool applying the Euclidian sum of distances 
method. The endpoints of the Langmuir fits right before the washing step with buffer were used 
for the creation of the dendrogram. 
 
Figure S2. Temperature dependence of oligonucleotide binding: The red curve shows binding of 
the mutant oligonucleotide to the complement functionalized cantilever in dependence of the 
hybridization temperature whereas the black curve depicts binding of the wild type 
oligonucleotide to the cantilever functionalized with the mutated oligonucleotide. The blue 
  
7 
hatched area indicates the melting temperature (Tm) range. The results imply 36 °C as the most 
promising temperature for binding experiments.
