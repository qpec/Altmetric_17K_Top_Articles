a comparative analysis of linked census and mortality 
records

Summary
Background Detailed assessments of mortality by occupation are scarce. We aimed to assess mortality by occupation in 
the UK, differences in rates between England and Wales and Scotland, and changes over time in Scotland.
Methods We analysed adults of working age (20–59 years) using linked census and death records. Main occupation was 
coded into more than 60 groups in the 2001 census, with mortality follow-up until Dec 31, 2011. Comparable occupation 
data were available for Scotland in 1991, allowing assessment of trends over time. We calculated age-standardised all-
cause mortality rates (per 100 000 person-years), stratified by sex. We used Monte Carlo simulation to derive p values 
and 95% CIs for the difference in mortality over time and between England and Wales and Scotland.
Findings During 4·51 million person-years of follow-up, mortality rates by occupation differed by more than three 
times between the lowest and highest observed rates in both men and women. Among men in England and Wales, 
health professionals had the lowest mortality (225 deaths per 100 000 person-years [95% CI 145–304]), with low rates 
also shown in managers and teachers. The highest mortality rates were in elementary construction (701 deaths per 
100 000 person-years [95% CI 593–809]), and housekeeping and factory workers. Among women, teachers and business 
professionals had low mortality, and factory workers and garment trade workers had high rates. Mortality rates have 
generally fallen, but have stagnated or even increased among women in some occupations, such as cleaners (337 deaths 
per 100 000 person years [95% CI 292–382] in 1991, rising to 426 deaths per 100 000 person years in 2001 [371–481]). 
Findings from simulation models suggested that if mortality rates by occupation in England and Wales applied to 
Scotland, 631 fewer men (95% CI 285–979; a 9·7% decrease) and 273 fewer women (26–513; 6·7% decrease) of working 
age would die in Scotland every year. Excess deaths in Scotland were concentrated among lower skilled occupations 
(eg, female cleaners).
Interpretation Mortality rates differ greatly by occupation. The excess mortality in Scotland is concentrated among low-
skilled workers and, although mortality has improved in men and women in most occupational groups, some groups 
have experienced increased rates. Future research investigating the specific causes of death at the detailed occupational 
level will be valuable, particularly with a view to understanding the health implications of precarious employment and 
the need to improve working conditions in very specific occupational groups.

Introduction
Employment has been long established as a fundamental 
determinant of health.1 Mortality rates by occupation 
were first calculated in the UK in 1851, following the 
country’s second ever census.2 Since then, regular 
decennial reports have provided updated estimates, with 
the last published in the 1970s.3–5 Similar analyses from 
other countries are rare and typically based on broad 
occupational categories.6,7 Ongoing changes in the labour 
market make a reassessment of mortality by occupation 
timely. In particular, trends in the job market (such as 
the rise of so-called zero-hours contracts) could adversely 
affect health and health inequalities.8–10 It cannot be 
assumed that patterns identified in the 1970s, which still 
underpin our contemporary understanding, continue to 
apply.
There has been a discernible shift away from mortality 
by occupation, with more recent research on health 
inequalities focusing on where people live, on the basis of 
area-based deprivation measures (such as the Index of 
Multiple Deprivation). Some research does use social 
class,11,12 but although this measure is based on occupation, 
it indicates the social position of an individual rather than 
their specific occupation.13 Social class therefore often 
combines fairly heterogeneous groups into typically fewer 
than eight categories.14,15 Research into mortality by 
occupation has focused on proportional mortality ratios, 
which identify the causes of death that are over-
represented in specific occupations.16,17 Such research is 
helpful in detecting what diseases are most likely to 
present in different groups, but does not provide 
information about how absolute mortality rates differ

between occupations and is therefore of little use to 
inform broad policy choices (as opposed to cause-specific 
remedies within occupational groups).18
Large health differences exist across the countries of the 
UK.19 Mortality in Scotland is consistently higher than 
elsewhere in the UK, a phenomenon not accounted for by 
socioeconomic deprivation.20 Some research has suggested 
that this excess mortality occurs across the socioeconomic 
spectrum, but studies so far have relied on broad 
classifications of social class, household socioeconomic 
position, or area-based deprivation.21–23 Alternative work, 
also applying aggregated measures, has found that 
Scotland’s excess mortality disproportionately affects the 
least advantaged.24 More detailed measures of occupation, 
based on classification by skill level, might better explain 
differences in mortality between Scotland and England, 
because of the more accurate classification of the 
population.
We therefore assessed mortality by detailed occupational 
groups in each part of the UK (England and Wales, 
Scotland, and Northern Ireland), differences in rates 
between England and Wales and Scotland, and changes 
over time in Scotland.
Methods
Data sources
We studied representative populations of adults of working 
age (20–59 years at baseline) in the UK, drawn from 
random samples of the 2001 census. We used three 
different data sources for different parts of the UK: the 
Office for National Statistics (ONS) Longitudinal Study 
provides a 1% sample of the population of England and 
Wales,25 the Scottish Longitudinal Study provides a 5·3% 
sample of the Scottish population,26 and the Northern 
Ireland Mortality Study (NIMS) includes 100% of the 
population of Northern Ireland.27 We analysed census data 
linked to mortality records to create three separate cohorts. 
For England and Wales and Scotland, deaths from 
throughout the UK were available from the ONS and 
National Records Scotland. Because the follow-up process 
for deaths in Northern Ireland differed, with deaths 
occurring outside of Northern Ireland unavailable, deaths 
for Northern Ireland are reported in the appendix. 
Occupation coded in a comparable manner was available 
from the 1991 census in Scotland only.
For all three datasets, we had no access to identifiable 
individual-level data, with all data derived from linkages 
that were anonymised before handover. Ethics approval 
was not required, but formal applications were reviewed 
by each data holder.
Exposure measures
Occupation was self-reported in the 2001 census, in 
response to the question “What is the full title of your 
main job?” The Standard Occupational Classification 
(SOC) 2000 codes are used by statistical agencies in the 
UK and elsewhere to classify occupations into meaningful 
groups, on the basis of comparable levels of training, 
prestige, and economic reward.28 Individuals not reporting 
an occupation were categorised as a separate group for the 
analysis (which could include students and homemakers, 
depending on their self-assessment). The SOC coding 
system is hierarchical, with four digit codes being the 
most detailed and one digit codes the least. Due to 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
We searched MEDLINE and Embase on May 19, 2015, to 
identify studies that reported mortality rates by occupation 
(from inception and limiting to English-language publications). 
Search terms included “occupation”, “job”, “mortality”, and 
“deaths”. Technological and societal developments have led to 
major changes in the nature of many occupations in recent 
decades, yet understanding of occupational patterns of 
mortality in the UK still relies largely on studies done in the 
1980s. Internationally, mortality rates by occupation have been 
reported in South Korea and New Zealand, but these studies are 
based on relatively few occupational categories. No recent 
studies that reported detailed mortality rates by occupation 
were identified. Similarly, mortality by occupation across the UK 
has not been compared in the past few decades.
Added value of this study
Mortality rates continue to show very large variation between 
occupations among the working-age population of the UK. 
Among men, health professionals, managers, and teachers had 
particularly low age-standardised mortality rates. 
The occupational groups with the highest mortality were 
elementary construction, housekeeping, and factory workers. 
Among women, teachers and business professionals had low 
mortality, with high rates among factory workers and those in 
the garment trade. Analyses based on Scottish data showed that 
mortality rates have reduced over time in most occupational 
groups, but this was not the case for all groups, with some that 
had high mortality rates in the 1990s experiencing little 
improvement or even increased mortality rates.
Implications of all the available evidence
Mortality rates by occupation differ by more than three times 
between the lowest and highest observed rates in both men 
and women in the UK. Although mortality has improved in 
most occupational groups, it has increased in others; reasons 
for this finding require investigation. Future research should 
consider the importance of reporting mortality by detailed 
occupation, which might provide an opportunity to understand 
the implications of increasing precariousness of employment 
and the need to improve working conditions in very specific 
occupational groups.

disclosure control restrictions, we are unable to report 
occupational groups that included fewer than ten deaths 
during follow-up. Our analysis therefore generally used 
three digit codes. When this criterion was not met, we 
combined groups within the hierarchical categories 
(appendix pp 2–13).
We sought to ensure that comparable occupational 
groups were used for analysis across all three datasets, and 
that codes were as detailed as possible. Because of 
differences in the jobs held by gender, and the need to 
minimise disclosure risk, we used different SOC 
groupings for men and women. Employment status by 
occupational group could not be considered within the 
analysis for disclosure control reasons and because of 
differences in the coding of variables. Therefore, we based 
the exposure measure on the person’s self-reported last 
main job, rather than the job an individual was actually 
doing on the date of the census.
Statistical analysis
Because of data security restrictions, analysis was done 
separately for each dataset on a standalone computer. For 
all three datasets, occupational groups were categorised on 
the basis of responses in the 2001 census and followed up 
for all-cause mortality until Dec 31, 2011. Mortality rates 
were calculated per 100 000 person-years, stratified by sex, 
and directly standardised with the WHO European 
standard population (5 year age bands) of 2013. To assess 
trends over time, we assessed mortality by occupation for 
the 1991 census sample in Scotland, followed up until 
Dec 31, 2001.
Since the role of chance could not be directly tested 
within a single statistical model across the separate 
datasets, we used Monte Carlo simulation to derive 
p values and 95% CIs for the difference in mortality over 
time and between England and Wales and Scotland. 
Simulation of 10 000 mortality rates by occupation was 
done based on the mean and standard error of the 
age-standardised rate for each occupation in England and 
Wales and Scotland. Simulated rates were compared 
across countries for each simulation, and the 2·5% and 
97·5% quantiles of the difference in rates calculated.
To aid interpretation of the public health importance of 
our findings, we simulated the number of expected deaths 
in England and Wales and Scotland under different 
scenarios. We first retrieved information about the age–
sex structure of the countries. We defined a baseline 
scenario as the number of deaths currently expected. Since 
the occupational structure is observed for only samples of 
the census, and there were no estimated mortality rates by 
occupation for a small part of the population, we first 
created a realistic synthetic population for each geography. 
To do so, we calculated the number of people expected in 
each occupational group, assuming the person-years 
observed in each of the random samples were reflected 
across the working-age population of their respective 
geographies in 2001. We then applied observed occupation-

specific mortality rates for each geography to calculate the 
number of expected deaths per year under the baseline 
scenario. We then modelled anticipated deaths under two 
alternative scenarios: first, by applying the occupation-
specific mortality rates for England and Wales to Scotland, 
and second by applying the occupation-specific rates for 
Scotland to England and Wales. These two scenarios 
provide estimates of how many deaths could be averted 
within Scotland if occupation-specific mortality rates for 
England and Wales applied, and how many excess deaths 
would occur if England and Wales experienced Scottish 
rates. To estimate 95% CIs, we did Monte Carlo modelling 
with 10 000 samples. Disclosure rules of the ONS 
Longitudinal Study and Scottish Longitudinal Study 
meant that we were unable to use age-specific and 
occupation-specific numbers of deaths in the Monte Carlo 
simulations. For this reason our simulation analyses were 
based on normal approximations to the age-standardised 
mortality rates rather than the more appropriate Poisson 
distribution. We did simulation modelling with R 
(version 3.3.1) and analyses in the safe settings holding the 
individual-level data with Stata version 13.2.

Results
The ONS Longitudinal Study and Scottish Longitudinal 
Study provided 4·51 million person-years of follow-up 
(2·31 million person-years for women and 2·20 million 
person-years for men). There were large differences in 
mortality by occupation in all parts of the UK, with 
differences of more than three times between the lowest 
and highest observed rates in both men and women in 
all three datasets. The largest differences were in 
Scotland. Patterns of high and low rates were broadly 
similar across the UK (tables 1, 2; appendix 14–21), in 
view of the imprecise estimation of rates within specific 
groups.
For men in England and Wales (table 1), health 
professionals (comprising medical doctors, dentists, 
psychologists, pharmacists, opticians, and vets) had the 
lowest mortality rates in all three datasets. Business and 
public 
services 
professionals 
(including 
lawyers, 
architects, and accountants) also had very low mortality, 
followed by different groups of managerial staff. Of men 
in intermediate skilled jobs, those working in electrical 
trades 
(including 
electricians, 
telecommunications 
engineers, and computer engineers) had relatively low

mortality compared with those in other jobs of a similar 
skill level. The highest mortality rates were in unskilled 
construction workers and those working in factories or 
similar settings (ie, elementary process plant jobs, 
including packers, canners, fillers, and labourers in 
foundries). Elementary personal services occupations, 
which include hospital or hotel porters, kitchen and 
catering assistants, and bar staff, also had high mortality 
rates. Occupational groups that included large numbers 
of people and tended to have high mortality rates were 
goods storage occupations (which include dockers and 
other goods handling occupations), process operatives 
(people involved in the processing of goods, such as food, 
drink, rubber, and plastics), and transport drivers and 
operatives (eg, drivers of heavy goods vehicles, taxis, and 
buses). Administrative and sales jobs had intermediate 
mortality rates. The highest mortality rates overall were 
in men who reported no occupation (table 1).
Among women, the lower mortality rates resulted in 
some variability in the ranking of some smaller 
occupational groups across the three datasets. The 
groups with low mortality in England, as well as 
Northern Ireland and Scotland, included business and 
public services professionals, teachers and corporate 
managers, and directors (table 2; appendix pp 16, 17, 
20). Nurses and allied health professionals had relatively 
low mortality, whereas w omen in administrative jobs 
tended to have intermediate mortality. Of the 
intermediate skilled jobs, child care and related personal 
services had relatively low mortality rates compared 
with jobs of a similar skill level. The highest mortality 
rates occurred in factory workers, including those 
working in the textile and garment trade. As with men, 
women in elementary process plant occupations had 
high mortality rates. Of the larger occupational groups, 
assemblers and routine operatives (eg, assemblers of 
electrical products, inspectors, and routine testers), 
elementary cleaning occupations, and elementary 
personal services occupations had high mortality rates. 
Women reporting an occupation had lower mortality 
rates than those who did not (table 2).
Rankings of mortality by occupation were generally 
similar between men and women (appendix pp 21, 22). 
Some differences were the relatively low mortality risks 
in women working as hairdressers and in elementary 
sales compared with men working in these occupations.
Mortality rates in Northern Ireland could not be directly 
compared with those in other parts of the UK because of 
under-ascertainment of mortality in the study data; 
however, the ranking of occupations was generally 
similar to other geographies (appendix pp 18–20). It was 
possible to report some specific mortality rates by 
occupation from Northern Ireland that could not be 
ascertained in other geographies for disclosure control 
reasons. For example, research professionals had 
relatively low mortality rates in both men and women in 
Northern Ireland (appendix pp 18–20).
Figure: Bubble graphs comparing mortality by occupation between England and Wales and Scotland, 
2001–11
Each bubble is proportional to the size of the employment group in England and Wales. Higher managerial 
occupations were classified as major Standard Occupational Classification [SOC] groups 1–3, intermediate 
occupations as major SOC groups 4–7, and routine occupations as major SOC groups 8 and 9.

Occupational mortality rates tended to be slightly 
higher in Scotland than in England and Wales (figure). 
Among both men and women, rates did not seem to 
differ systematically between Scotland and England and 
Wales for more highly skilled jobs. By contrast, lower 
skilled occupations with high mortality rates tended to 
have even higher rates in Scotland. However, in view of 
the relatively small sample size for many categories, 
mortality differed significantly between only a few 
specific occupational groups.
Assessment of trends within Scotland showed that 
men and women in most occupational groups had 
reduced mortality; however, mortality rates increased 
among some occupations (tables 3, 4). Mortality in three 
occupational groups (assemblers and routine operatives, 
elementary cleaning occupations, and people reporting 
no job) was high in 1991, and rose over time in 
women—a pattern that did not seem to be due to chance 
(tables 3, 4).
In our simulation analyses, which applied mortality 
rates from England and Wales to the population of 
Scotland, we estimated 631 (95% CI 285–979) excess 
deaths in men (out of 6519 deaths, a 9·7% difference) 
and 273 (26–513) excess deaths in women (out of 
4068 deaths, a 6·7% difference) among the working-age 
population of Scotland per year (tables 5, 6). If Scottish 
mortality rates by occupation applied across England and 
Wales, we estimated that 6085 (95% CI 3008 to 9175) 
more expected deaths would occur in men and 2273 
(–165 to 4688) more deaths would occur in women each 
year (appendix 23–27).
Discussion
Mortality rates by occupation differed by more than three 
times between the lowest and highest observed rates in 
men and women in the UK. In men, health professionals, 
managers, and teachers had particularly low mortality 
rates, whereas those working in elementary agricultural, 
construction, and housekeeping jobs had high rates. In 
women, teachers and business professionals had low 
mortality, with high rates reported in factory workers and 
those working in the garment trade. Individuals reporting 
no occupation had far higher mortality rates than people 
in all other occupational groups in both men and women.

When comparing Scotland to England and Wales, 
mortality rates were often even higher in health-
disadvantaged groups in Scotland, but no consistent 
differences were shown in people in the most health-
advantaged occupations. Findings from simulation 
models estimate an excess of 631 deaths in men and 
273 deaths in women every year in Scotland’s working-
age population. We studied trends over a 20 year period 
in Scotland and found that mortality rates have fallen in 
most occupations, but have remained stagnant or even 
increased amongst women in some occupational groups.
Our study has several strengths. We analysed three 
nationally 
representative 
administrative 
datasets. 
Furthermore, we were able to compare trends in 
mortality rates by occupation over time because of the 
availability 
of 
similarly 
categorised 
occupational 
information within Scotland. Use of linked data avoids 
the potential for numerator–denominator bias, a known 
problem because reports of occupation from death 
certificates and self-report can differ. Our large sample 
allowed us to investigate occupational categories in 
greater detail than is usually possible. 
There are several limitations. First, our exposure 
variable was based on self-reported main occupation at a 
single timepoint, with follow-up that potentially lasted up 
to age 70 years. Our findings therefore reflect a 
respondent’s perceived main occupation, but might not 
reflect their occupation at that or other specific times. We 
were unable to investigate the role of employment status, 
which exerts an important influence on mortality,29 
because of the challenges in carrying out parallel analyses 
within three different safe settings, which made pooling 
of data impossible. Although our study is very large, the 
low risk of mortality in people of working age precludes 
investigation of cause-specific mortality outcomes within 
the available administrative data samples. The different 
structures of occupational categories between men and 
women prevented formal comparison of results between 
men and women. Because of the lack of comparability of 
outcome ascertainment within Northern Ireland, we 
were unable to compare the rates to those in other parts 
of the UK. Furthermore, we were unable to study Wales-
specific mortality rates. Finally, our analysis is primarily 
descriptive and cannot assess causal relationships. The 
quantification of excess mortality in Scotland’s working-
age population does not imply that improvements in 
occupational conditions will narrow the gap between 
countries. Instead, by use of an alternative and more 
detailed measure of social position, we provide additional 
insights into the distribution of mortality. Similarly, 
trends in mortality by occupation reflect both changes in 
risks and the composition of the occupational groups.
Research into mortality by occupation in other countries 
has generally been in broad groups. Holmes and colleagues6 
reported mortality rates by occupation in men in 
New Zealand according to the nine broadest SOC 
categories, finding a difference of roughly two times

between the highest and lowest rates. Similarly, Lee and 
colleagues7 reported mortality by occupation for the nine 
most aggregated SOC codes in South Korea and again 
reported an approximate doubling of mortality between the 
lowest and highest groups.7 Our study provides a much 
more detailed picture than presented in recent decades, 
thereby demonstrating larger variations than previously 
observable.
Mortality by occupation can be considered as being 
driven by two inter-related factors: the socioeconomic 
composition of occupational groups, with occupation 
considered a specific measure of socioeconomic position, 
and differing exposure to work-related risks and benefits. 
The labour market has changed radically since 
publication of the last assessment of mortality by 
occupation in the UK more than three decades ago, with 
workers today experiencing very different health 
outcomes. Monitoring of changes in mortality by 
occupation is necessary to inform policy responses to 
address new health risks that arise in response to 
ongoing and upcoming changes in the labour market. 
Potential adverse effects of increased job insecurity 
(reflected by zero-hours contracts) are likely to affect both 
socioeconomic circumstances (through, for example, low 
pay and income insecurity) and job stresses (such as a 
mismatch between job control and work demands) in 
low-skilled 
workers—the 
very 
groups 
already 
experiencing high mortality rates. Looking to the future, 
there is likely to be a reduction in availability of unskilled

(and some skilled) jobs as a consequence of increasing 
automation. We recorded very high mortality rates 
among people reporting no occupation in both men and 
women, with rates in women having potentially increased 
over time. Reduced availability of low-skilled jobs might 
therefore herald substantial public health risks.
Mortality rates by occupation are also valuable in 
guiding prioritisation of scarce health and other 
resources. There is considerable interest in workplace-
based interventions to improve health, but the choice of 
which occupational groups to target has not been 
informed by a systematic assessment of need. We have 
identified specific occupational groups that might benefit 
from targeted prevention approaches—eg, interventions 
targeted at male transport drivers who typically have high 
levels of sedentary time. Employers could play a specific 
part in mitigation of risks, but the increasingly transient 
nature of employer–employee relationships might mean 
that government action is also necessary. Although our 
findings identify groups at greatest risk, more detailed 
research is needed to explain why. Such research is likely 
to require an iterative approach, drilling into the data to 
understand the potentially complex interactions involved, 
such as how context (eg, geography) influences the 
association between occupation and health, and how 
occupation correlates with different causes of mortality 
and, by extension, the risk factors involved.
Our study has particular relevance to policy makers in 
Scotland. There has been considerable concern that 
health outcomes in Scotland are poorer than elsewhere 
in western Europe.30 Our findings show that excess 
mortality in Scotland is disproportionately experienced 
by people in relatively disadvantaged occupations, even 
when using a detailed measure of occupational skill level. 
The pattern also varies by gender and is more prominent 
for men. Our results echo findings that suggest excess 
mortality in Scotland is particularly concentrated among 
people living in the most disadvantaged areas.31 Efforts in 
Scotland should focus on meeting the health needs of 
individuals at the greatest socioeconomic disadvantage.
Future research that investigates the specific causes of 
death at the detailed occupational level will be valuable, 
particularly with a view to identifying potential specific 
interventions to target occupations with the highest 
mortality risks. Investigation of the inter-relationship 
between occupational group and employment status will 
aid understanding of the implications of increasing 
precariousness of work.8,9 Our study has identified very 
poor, and potentially even worsening, mortality risks for 
some specific occupational groups. This finding should
