Abstract
Lysozymes are nearly omnipresent as the first line of immune defense against microbes in
animals. They exert bactericidal action through antimicrobial peptide activity and peptidogly-
can hydrolysis. Gram-negative bacteria developed several weapons to battle lysozymes,
including inhibitors of c-type lysozymes in the MliC/PliC family and the Neisseria adhesin
complex protein (ACP). Until the recent discovery of ACP, no proteinaceous lysozyme inhibi-
tors were reported for the genus Neisseria, including the important human pathogen N.
gonorrhoeae. Here, we describe a previously unrecognized gonococcal virulence mecha-
nism involving a protein encoded by the open reading frame ngo1063 that acts to counteract
c-type Iysozyme and provides a competitive advantage in the murine model of gonorrhea.
We named this protein SliC as a surface-exposed lysozyme inhibitor of c-type lysozyme. SliC
displays low overall primary sequence similarity to the MliC/PliC inhibitors, but we demon-
strate that it has a parallel inhibitory mechanism. Our studies provide the first evidence that
bacterial proteinaceous lysozyme inhibitors protect against host lysozyme during infection
based on lack of attenuation of the ΔsliC mutant in lysozyme knock-out mice, and that the
conserved residues involved in lysozyme inhibition, S83 and K103, are functionally indis-
pensable during infection in wild type mice. Recombinant SliC completely abrogated the lytic
activity of human and chicken c-type lysozymes, showing a preference towards human lyso-
zyme with an IC50 of 1.85 μM and calculated KD value of 9.2 ± 1.9 μM. In contrast, mutated
SliC bearing S83A and K103A substitutions failed to protect fluorescein-labeled cell-wall from
lysozyme-mediated hydrolysis. Further, we present data revealing that SliC is a surface-dis-
played lipoprotein released in membrane vesicles that is expressed throughout all phases of
growth, in conditions relevant to different niches of the human host, and during experimental
infection of the murine genital tract. SliC is also highly conserved and expressed by diverse
gonococcal isolates as well as N. meningitidis, N. lactamica, and N. weaveri. This study is the
first to highlight the importance of an anti-lysozyme strategy to escape the innate immune
response during N. gonorrhoeae infection.

 Author summary
Neisseria gonorrhoeae, the etiologic agent of gonorrhea, is a clinically important pathogen
due to the emergence of multi-drug resistance and the lack of a vaccine(s). During host
colonization, pathogenic and commensal Neisseria inevitably encounter lysozyme, a
major host innate defense factor that is abundantly present in epithelial secretions and
phagocytic cells. Although Neisseria spp produce a c-type lysozyme inhibitor, the Adhesin
Complex Protein, the significance of lysozyme inhibition for host colonization has not
been addressed. Here we demonstrate the existence of a new c-type lysozyme inhibitor in
Neisseria. We show that it is a surface-displayed lipoprotein in N. gonorrhoeae and,
through its lysozyme-blocking function, plays a critical role in colonization of genital tract
mucosae during infection in the female gonorrhea mouse model. We named the protein
SliC as a surface-exposed lysozyme inhibitor of c-type lysozyme. Understanding the mech-
anisms underlying anti-lysozyme strategies may facilitate antimicrobial development.
Introduction
The first line of host immune defense against bacterial pathogens in plants and in invertebrate
and vertebrate animals involves degradation of peptidoglycan through innate immune system
components such as lysozymes [1–3]. Peptidoglycan (murein) is the major structural compo-
nent of the bacterial cell envelope that provides resistance against turgor pressure and prevents
cell death due to lysis. Peptidoglycan forms a giant three-dimensional network built of linear
glycan strands of alternating β-(1,4) linked N-acetylmuramic acid and N-acetylglucosamine
sugars that are cross-linked by short peptides [4]. Lysozymes are powerful host weapons exert-
ing bacterial killing by hydrolytic action on the glycosidic bond linking the sugars, which
breaks peptidoglycan [3, 5]. Three main classes of lysozymes have been distinguished within
the animal kingdom including c- (conventional or chicken), g- (goose), and i- (invertebrate)
type lysozyme [2, 3]. The mammalian lysozyme-like gene family consists of lysozyme c, lactal-
bumin and calcium-binding lysozyme [5]. Recent studies, however, showed the presence of
eight additional diverse types of lysozyme-like genes in the genome of the common ancestor of
all extant mammals, and ten lysozyme-like sequences distributed over five chromosomes in
humans [6]. Therefore, it is not surprising that bacteria have evolved sophisticated mecha-
nisms to escape killing via murein hydrolysis by chemical modifications of the peptidoglycan
backbone and by synthesis of proteinaceous lysozyme inhibitors [7, 8]. The latter anti-lyso-
zyme strategy targets i-, g-, or c-type lysozymes and encompasses at least five inhibitor families
distributed exclusively in Gram-negative bacteria and predominantly in Proteobacteria [8].
Among the inhibitors of c-type lysozyme are Ivy (Inhibitor of vertebrate lysozyme) and Ivy-
like proteins, the MliC/PliC family (membrane-bound or periplasmic lysozyme inhibitor of c-
type lysozyme, respectively), and the Neisseria Adhesin Complex Protein, ACP [8, 9].
MliC/PliC proteins and ACP have been implicated in host colonization based on their abil-
ity to at least partially protect bacteria against challenge with their cognate lysozyme in vitro
[8–12]. Surprisingly, to date, only two reports have investigated the role of lysozyme inhibitors
in in vivo virulence. These studies demonstrated the importance of MliC from Avian Patho-
genic Escherichia coli and Edwardsiella tarda in a subcutaneous chicken infection model and a
turbot model, respectively [13, 14].
N. gonorrhoeae colonizes mucosal surfaces of the reproductive tract, pharynx, rectum and
conjunctiva in its sole human host (15). During colonization of these different niches, the

 gonococcus may encounter c-type lysozyme in tears, saliva, urine, serum, vaginal fluid, cervical
mucus, and in the lysosomal granules of neutrophils and macrophages (3, 16, 17). Until the
recent discovery of ACP, no proteinaceous lysozyme inhibitors were reported for the genus
Neisseria, including the important human pathogen, N. gonorrhoeae [8, 9].
Here we describe a previously unrecognized N. gonorrhoeae virulence mechanism involving
a protein encoded by the open reading frame (ORF) ngo1063 in N. gonorrhoeae FA1090 that
acts as a weapon to counteract the innate immunity effector c-type lysozyme and significantly
impacts N. gonorrhoeae fitness in the female mouse genital tract. We identified NGO1063 in
high-throughput proteomic investigations geared towards the discovery of potential gonorrhea
vaccine antigens and therapeutic targets in N. gonorrhoeae cell envelopes and naturally released
membrane vesicles (MVs) [15, 16]. NGO1063 is annotated in UniProt as a membrane-bound
lysozyme inhibitor of the c-type lysozyme family (Protein Q5F7V4_NEIG1). NGO1063 displays
low overall sequence similarity to the MliC/PliC protein family, but we demonstrate that it has a
parallel inhibitory mechanism and provide the first evidence that the conserved residues
involved in lysozyme inhibition are functionally critical during in vivo infection. Supporting
these findings, gonococci lacking NGO1063 show comparable fitness to wild type bacteria dur-
ing competitive infection in lysozyme-defective mice, but are attenuated in wild-type mice of
the same background. We also present data showing that NGO1063 is exposed to the extracellu-
lar milieu, expressed during in vivo infection, and conserved in pathogenic and commensal
Neisseria, highlighting the importance of this anti-lysozyme strategy during host colonization.
We named this protein SliC as a surface-exposed lysozyme inhibitor of c-type lysozyme.
Results
NGO1063 is a putative lysozyme c inhibitor
Members of different lysozyme inhibitor families show little similarity at the primary amino
acid sequence level [8]. Despite the low sequence identity (24–39%) of the PliC and MliC type
inhibitors, these inhibitors display the same specificity and share a specific sequence motif as
well as an eight-stranded antiparallel ß-barrel structural topology [8, 11, 12]. In silico analysis
of the deduced amino acid sequence of our new proteome-derived antigen/drug target [15,
16], sliC, revealed a predicted signal peptide with a lipobox motif (LSLAAC) containing an
invariant cysteine (C18) and a putative MliC domain (residues 47–118; Figs 1A and 2A). Com-
parison of the primary amino acid sequence of SliC with other characterized MliC proteins
from E. coli, Salmonella enterica and Pseudomonas aeruginosa showed only 18.8–23.3% overall
identity (S1 Table). However, the additional conserved regions of the COG3895 domain in the
MliC/PliC family, SxSGAxY and YxxxTKG [8], closely resembled those found in SliC (Fig
1A). Further, the P. aeruginosa MliC residues S89 and K103, involved in interaction with hen
egg white c-type lysozyme (HEWL) [11], were present in SliC (S83 and K103), which together
suggested that ngo1063 encodes a c-type lysozyme inhibitor.
To further compare SliC to other lysozyme inhibitors of the MliC/PliC family and Neisseria
ACP, a phylogenetic analysis was performed (Fig 1B). Two distinct clusters were revealed in
the phylogenetic tree; one cluster contained lysozyme inhibitors found in the genomes of Neis-
seria species, while the second cluster was comprised of MliC and PliC proteins from more
diverse bacterial species. These results indicated that meningococcal and gonococcal SliC and
ACP are more closely related to each other than to MliC/PliC lysozyme inhibitors from other
bacterial species, despite their low primary sequence identity (S1 Table).

NCBI with the Clustal Omega online tool (Clustal 2.1; https://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/clustalo/) using the default alignment parameters. The
predicted lipoprotein signal peptide is shown in aquamarine. The conserved regions of the COG3895 domain in the MliC/PliC family, SxSGAxY
and YxxxTKG are shown in red and green boxes, respectively. Preserved residues are marked in color within conserved regions and by asterisks (�)
throughout the sequences. The residues S83 and K103, predicted to be involved in interaction with c-type lysozyme are designated by red and green
arrows, respectively. (B) A phylogenetic comparison of SliC, MliC/PliC and ACP. The tree was constructed using the Jones-Taylor-Thornton model
[58] in MEGA. Neighbor-Join and BioNJ algorithms were applied to a pairwise-distance matrix derived from the JTT model to obtain an initial tree
for the heuristic search. The phylogenies were tested by 500 bootstrap iterations, and the tree with the highest log likelihood is presented. (C) A
phylogenetic comparison of SliC alleles in 3787 isolates of N. gonorrhoeae deposited to the PubMLST was performed as described above. The
dominant allele (29) present in over 97% gonococcal isolates and in FA1090 is denoted in a red box. (D) Analysis of single nucleotide
polymorphisms of SliC (locus NEIS1425) in N. gonorrhoeae was performed by comparing DNA sequences between gonococcal isolates deposited to
PubMLST (https://pubmlst.org/neisseria/, as of April 11, 2018). (E) A panel constituting 37 N. gonorrhoeae isolates that are distinct genetically,
geographically, and temporally, including common laboratory strains; clinical isolates collected from public health clinics in Baltimore from 1991 to
1994 and Seattle from 2011 to 2016; and the 14 isolates constituting the 2016 WHO reference strains were grown concurrently on solid medium for
20 h in 5% CO2 at 37˚ C. Cells were collected, lysed and processed for immunoblotting. (F) Whole-cell lysates of different Neisseria, including
pathogenic N. meningitidis MC58, commensal N. lactamica NLI83/-01, and a human opportunistic pathogen N. weaveri 1032 were separated by
SDS-PAGE and probed with antisera. In all experiments, samples were matched by equivalent OD600 units, resolved in a 4 to 20% Tris-glycine gel,

 SliC is conserved and expressed in a panel of diverse Neisseria
To extend these studies, we analyzed SliC sequence diversity among N. gonorrhoeae and other
Neisseria species using the translated amino acid sequences from 10 alleles found in N. gonor-
rhoeae (Fig 1C) and the 224 alleles found in the population of over 44 thousand Neisseria
and transferred onto nitrocellulose. Immunoblots were performed using polyclonal rabbit antisera against SliC. Cell lysates of wild type FA1090 and
isogenic ΔsliC were loaded as controls for the experiments.

anti-SliC antisera. Whole cell lysates were matched by the same OD600. (D) Cultures of N. gonorrhoeae FA1090 wild type harvested
from liquid cultures at mid-logarithmic growth were subjected to subcellular fractionation. Isolated proteomes of cytoplasmic and

by the same total protein concentration, separated by SDS-PAGE and probed with polyclonal rabbit antisera against SliC, BamA,
BamD, SurA, and Zwf. (E) Wild type gonococci were collected from solid media, sub-cultured in broth for 3 h, diluted to OD600 of 0.1,
and cultured until OD600 of ~ 1.0 was reached. Gonococci were washed and after OD600 adjustment to 2.0, the bacterial cells were
incubated for 1 h at 37˚C with proteinase K at final concentrations as designated above the immunoblots. Protease was deactivated,
samples were normalized by the same OD600, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and probed with polyclonal antisera to determine protease
susceptibility. (F) N. gonorrhoeae FA1090 strains, as shown above the graphs, were cultured in liquid medium, harvested, and
suspended to OD600 of 2.0. Intact and lysed cells were spotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. Individual protein profiles were analyzed
by immunoblotting with specific antisera against SliC, BamA, BamD, SurA, and Zwf.

 isolates present in the PubMLST database (S1 Fig ). These phylogenetic analyses showed that
all SliC alleles are closely related in pathogenic and commensal Neisseria and allele 29, of
which FA1090 SliC is a member (Fig 1C, red box), represented nearly 98% of the alleles found
in N. gonorrhoeae (3,787 out of 4,990 N. gonorrhoeae isolates; 1,111 isolates had no value for
the sliC locus). Analysis of single nucleotide polymorphisms revealed the existence of 9 and
157 polymorphic sites within all alleles found in N. gonorrhoeae (Fig 1D) and in all Neisseria
(S2 Fig ), respectively, further confirming high conservation of SliC.
Finally, to assess the conservation at the level of immune-recognition, we probed whole cell
lysates from 37 temporally, geographically and genetically diverse N. gonorrhoeae isolates,
including common laboratory strains; clinical isolates collected from public health clinics in
Baltimore from 1991 to 1994 and Seattle from 2011 to 2013 [16]; and the 2016 WHO reference
strains [17] with antiserum against FA1090 SliC (Fig 1E). SliC was detected in all strains tested,
and in pathogenic N. meningitidis; commensal N. lactamica; and a human opportunistic patho-
gen typically associated with canine bite wounds, N. weaveri (Fig 1F).
Cumulatively, these findings demonstrated a high conservation of SliC and a similar cellular
pool in pathogenic N. gonorrhoeae and N. meningitidis.
Purification of SliC variants and mutant construction
Lysozyme inhibitors in their natural forms are difficult to obtain with high purity, therefore
these proteins have been examined primarily as recombinant proteins [9, 12, 14, 18, 19]. To
initiate characterization of SliC, we engineered recombinant versions of wild type SliC (rSliC)
and its mutated variant (rSliC�) bearing alanine substitutions in residues S83 and K103. Both
recombinant proteins lacked signal peptides and contained a C-terminal Tobacco Etch Virus
(TEV) protease cleavage site followed by a 6×His-tag (Fig 2A). The two proteins were purified
in a soluble form to homogeneity through several chromatography steps and migrated on
SDS-PAGE according to the predicted molecular mass of 11.65 kDa (Fig 2B). Untagged rSliC
was used to obtain polyclonal rabbit antisera. Subsequently, we utilized N. gonorrhoeae
FA1090 to create a null mutant in ngo1063 (ΔsliC) and complemented strains, ΔsliC/P::sliC
and ΔsliC/P::sliC�, in which either wild type sliC or mutated sliC� bearing S83A K103A substi-
tutions were expressed under the control of the native sliC promoter (Fig 2A). The polyclonal
rabbit anti-SliC antisera recognized SliC within whole cell lysates obtained from wild type and
both complemented strains, but no signal was detected in ΔsliC (Fig 2C).
SliC is a surface-displayed lipoprotein released in natural membrane
vesicles
Lipoproteins traverse the cell envelope and may be anchored through their invariant triacy-
lated cysteine residue to the periplasmic side of the inner or outer membrane, or may be trans-
located across the outer membrane for cell-surface decoration [20–22]. To examine SliC
localization, cell sub-fractionation experiments coupled with immunoblotting were per-
formed. Corroborating our proteomic investigations [15, 16], these experiments demonstrated
the presence of SliC in the cell envelopes and naturally released membrane vesicles. The outer
membrane proteins BamA and BamD were also present in this fraction, and as expected, the
periplasmic and cytoplasmic markers, SurA and Zwf, respectively, were found primarily in the
periplasmic and cytoplasmic sub-proteomes (Fig 2D).
Previously applied in silico approaches categorized SliC as an extracellular protein [15];
however, a reliable method to predict whether a given lipoprotein is surface-exposed or faces
the periplasmic side of the outer membrane is currently lacking [22]. Therefore, we utilized
proteinase K shaving assays and dot blots as two independent experimental methodologies to

 further examine SliC localization. Exposing intact gonococci to increasing concentrations of
proteinase K resulted in detection of lower amounts of SliC, indicating that it is accessible to
external protease, similarly to the surface protein marker BamA (Fig 2E). In contrast, BamD,
which is anchored to the periplasmic side of the outer membrane [23], remained unaffected.
Likewise, SurA and Zwf resisted proteinase K challenge, verifying the intactness of N. gonor-
rhoeae cells during the experimental procedures. SliC was also detected on the cell surface of
wild type, ΔsliC/P::sliC, and ΔsliC/P::sliC� when analyzed by an immunological dot blot assay,
in which suspensions of intact gonococci are spotted on nitrocellulose filters followed by incu-
bation with the antisera (Fig 2F). In these experiments, as expected, BamA was detected on the
cell surface in all strains, whereas no signal was observed for BamD, SurA and Zwf unless the
cells were lysed.
Together, these studies showed that SliC is a surface-displayed lipoprotein released to the
extracellular milieu in native membrane vesicles and that alteration of residues predicted to
interact with c-type lysozyme does not affect its localization.
SliC functions as a lysozyme inhibitor
To examine whether SliC acts as an inhibitor of c-type lysozyme, we employed an assay that
takes advantage of a highly sensitive quenched fluorescent lysozyme substrate–fluorescein-
labeled cell walls of Micrococcus lysodeikticus. As expected, addition of either HEWL or human
lysozyme c (HL) to the bacterial suspension triggered hydrolysis of the ß-(1,4) bond between N-
acetylmuramic acid and N-acetylglucosamine in peptidoglycan and resulted in robust fluores-
cence dequenching (Fig 3A, 3B and 3D). These reactions were abrogated upon addition of
increasing amounts of rSliC. Comparison of the inhibition of HEWL and HL activity by incuba-
tion with molar equivalent concentrations of rSliC demonstrated drastically reduced HL lytic
activity in the presence of 1.25 μM rSliC, whereas no significant effect was observed for HEWL
(Fig 3C). Furthermore, the mutated SliC variant, rSliC�, failed to inhibit HL-driven cell-wall
hydrolysis, confirming that S83 and K103 were critical residues for the SliC-HL interaction (Fig
3D). The half-maximal (50%) inhibitory concentration, IC50, of SliC against the lytic activity of
HL towards M. lysodeikticus peptidoglycan was determined to be 1.85 μM (Fig 3E).
To gain further insights into interactions between SliC and HL, we employed Bio-Layer
Interferometry (BLI), a label-free biophysical method that provides kinetic data for protein-
protein interactions. It is similar to Surface Plasmon Resonance but is less affected by changes
in sample composition [24, 25]. Biotinylated rSliC was immobilized on streptavidin sensors
and incubated with increasing concentrations of HL. BLI experiments were executed using a
steady state method and curve fitting of the association and dissociation responses. Curves
were fitted to a biphasic binding model, yielding a calculated KD value of 9.2 ± 1.9 μM
(average ± SEM; Fig 3F). This result suggests a moderate binding of SliC to HL in vitro, which
is very similar to the ACP-HL interaction with a KD of 11 μM [9].
Cumulatively, our biochemical studies demonstrated that SliC is an efficient inhibitor of c-
type lysozyme with functionally pivotal residues S83 and K103 and suggest that SliC is a better
inhibitor of HL than HEWL.
SliC does not affect N. gonorrhoeae fitness in vitro
Complete elimination of SliC or replacing SliC with its mutated variant, SliC�, expressed at the
native level (Fig 2C) had no effect on the growth rate of ΔsliC or ΔsliC/P::sliC� strains in liquid
media (Fig 4A). Similarly, no fitness defects were observed when ΔsliC was exposed to condi-
tions that more closely resemble micro-ecological niches encountered by gonococci in the

lysozyme substrate were used to determine the SliC-mediated inhibition of hen egg white c-type lysozyme (HEWL; A, C) and human lysozyme (HL; B-E). All assays were
conducted using 96 well microtiter plates. Experimental samples containing 2.5 μM of either HEWL or HL were incubated with increasing concentrations of SliC (0–
10 μM; as indicated on the right of each panel). The control wells contained HEWL, HL, or SliC alone. After incubation, the reaction was initiated by addition of lysozyme
substrate and monitored for 1 h at excitation and emission wavelengths of 485 nm and 530 nm, respectively. Experiments reported in panels A and B show averages and
corresponding SEMs from four independent trials. (C) Comparison of the inhibition of HEWL and HL activity by incubation with molar equivalent concentrations of
rSliC (n = 4, mean±SEMs) was performed as described above. Protein concentrations (μM) are shown below the graph. ���p<0.0001; not statistically significant p value of
0.25 (ns). (D) 2.5 μM of HL and 5 μM of either SliC or SliC� were used to test the inhibition of HL by SliC�. Assays were performed as outlined above (n = 3, mean±SEMs).
(E) The half-maximal (50%) inhibitory concentration, IC50, of SliC against the lytic activity of HL towards M. lysodeikticus peptidoglycan was determined by incubating
2.5 μM of HL with increasing concentrations of SliC (0–10 μM). (F) The binding affinity of SliC to lysozyme was assessed by biolayer interferometry. Biotinylated rSliC
(20 μg/mL) was immobilized on streptavidin sensors for 10 min and incubated with increasing concentrations of HL as shown on the graph. Unloaded sensors were used
as controls. After establishing the baseline, the association and dissociation steps were performed for 600 s. Experiments were performed in three biological replicates with
curve fitting using a 2:1 (Heterogeneous Ligand) model. KD value calculations were completed using Octet Data Analysis and mean±SEM is reported (version 9).

conditions on solid media (SGC), during iron limitation (-Fe), in the presence of 7.5% normal human serum (+NHS),
and anaerobically (-O2). CFU’s were enumerated after 22 h of aerobic and 48 h of anaerobic growth. Experiments were
performed in three biological replicates and means with corresponding SEMs are presented. (C) To assess the role of
SliC and ACP in in vitro protection of N. gonorrhoeae from the hydrolytic activity of HL, wild type FA1090, ΔsliC, ΔsliC
complemented with sliC, Δacp, Δacp/P::acp, ΔacpΔsliC, or ΔacpΔsliC/P::acp P::sliC were suspended in liquid media to
an OD600 of 0.1 and cultured at 37˚C for 3 h. Bacteria were diluted to 1×104 CFU/mL and 90 μL of each culture was
incubated for 3 h at 37˚C with the membrane-permeabilizing agent lactoferrin (5 mg/mL) and increasing
concentrations of human lysozyme as specified below the graph. Suspensions were plated for CFU scoring (n = 5,

 human host such as iron deprivation, the presence of normal human sera and anaerobiosis
(Fig 4B).
We next studied whether SliC protects N. gonorrhoeae from the hydrolytic activity of HL in
the presence of the outer membrane permeabilizing protein, lactoferrin. Surprisingly, even at
HL concentrations higher than are physiologically relevant, absence of SliC did not render the
cells more susceptible (Fig 4C). We hypothesized that the lysozyme-blocking function of ACP
may contribute to the observed phenomenon [9, 26, 27]. To dissect the possible functional
relationship between SliC and ACP, we constructed an acp clean knockout and ΔacpΔsliC
mutant in the parental FA1090 background. Subsequently, all mutant strains concurrently
with the corresponding complemented strains were incubated with lactoferrin at 5 mg/mL
and increasing concentrations of lysozyme. The single ΔsliC and Δacp mutants had similar
sensitivity towards lysozyme as the wild type cells while the double mutant exhibited 70, 370
and 67,000 fold reduction in survival when exposed to 5, 10 and 20 mg/mL of lysozyme,
respectively (Fig 4C; green line). This sensitivity phenotype was restored to wild type resistance
in the complemented strain carrying acp and sliC placed under the control of their own pro-
moters. These studies suggested that SliC and ACP work interchangeably and each of the lyso-
zyme inhibitors, in addition to the other mechanisms used by N. gonorrhoeae to resist killing
by lysozyme e.g. lytic transglycosylases [9, 26, 27], is sufficient to provide resistance to lyso-
zyme in vitro. Exposure of ΔsliC and Δacp knockouts to additional cell envelope permeabiliz-
ing agents (antimicrobial peptide polymyxin B, bile salts, or nonionic surfactant Tween 20) in
combination with lysozyme and lactoferrin treatment resulted in statistically significant
decrease in viability of ΔsliC bacteria solely in the presence of the non-physiologically-relevant
Tween 20 (Fig 4D).
To test whether lack of the surface–exposed SliC, ACP or both proteins have effects on cell
envelope integrity, LOS, or cell morphology, we carried out Etest antibiotic susceptibility
experiments (S2 Table), isolated and stained LOS, and performed scanning electron micros-
copy studies. No differences were noted in LOS migration and abundance (Fig 4E), nor were
the overall morphology or cell sizes altered in any gonococcal strain (Fig 4F). In addition,
solely the ΔacpΔsliC mutant showed a two-fold decrease in minimal inhibitory concentration
(MIC) towards benzylpenicillin, suggesting modest disruption in cell envelope homeostasis
(S2 Table).
SliC does not function as an adhesin
Surface-exposed lipoproteins are linked to a wide range of roles including bacterial adhesion
[22, 28]. In Neisseria, the lipoprotein heparin-binding antigen (NHBA) facilitates adhesion to
the surface of human epithelial cells [29] and ACP functions as both a lysozyme inhibitor and
an adhesin in N. meningitidis [9, 30]. Therefore, to examine whether SliC plays a similar dual
function in N. gonorrhoeae, we performed time-course adhesion experiments and invasion
assays with human cervical epidermal carcinoma ME180 cells in vitro. Similar numbers of
adherent (Fig 5A) and internalized (Fig 5B) gonococci were recovered for wild type, ΔsliC, and
permeabilizing agents (Polymyxin B at 100 U/mL; Tween 20 at 0.001%; bile salts at 0.05%; or all compounds combined
together) in the presence of lactoferrin (5 mg/mL) and lysozyme (5 mg/mL) as described above and bacteria were
plated for CFU scoring after 4 h of incubation at 37˚C (n = 3, mean±SEMs; �p<0.05). (E) Lipooligosaccharide was
isolated from indicated N. gonorrhoeae strains collected from solid media. After cell lysis and proteinase K treatment
equal amounts were loaded on SDS-PAGE followed by silver staining. (F) Scanning electromicrographs of N.

phosphotungstic acid. Scale bar represents 0.5 μm.

 both complemented strains at all timepoints, demonstrating that SliC does not contribute to
bacterial association with and invasion to human cervical ME180 cells.
SliC is expressed throughout bacterial growth in vitro and during lower
genital tract infection of female mice
To further assess SliC function in N. gonorrhoeae biology, expression of the protein was exam-
ined in vitro and in vivo during colonization of the female mouse genital tract (Fig 6). These
studies showed that gonococci produce SliC throughout different growth phases in liquid
media, similar to the ubiquitously-expressed MetQ [16], which was used as a comparison (Fig
6A and 6B). SliC was also expressed at comparable levels under different host-relevant condi-
tions, such as iron deprivation and in the presence of normal human sera. Interestingly, an
increase in the SliC cellular pool was observed during anaerobic growth (Fig 6C).
The E. coli MliC and Ivy proteins are both part of the Rcs extra-cytoplasmic stress regulon
that responds to lysozyme insult by increased expression [31]. We wondered whether sliC
induction could result from exposure to lysozyme. To test this hypothesis, wild type N. gonor-
rhoeae was incubated in the presence of lactoferrin and increasing concentrations of HL. No
significant changes in the SliC cellular pool between untreated and lysozyme-treated cells were
revealed by immunoblot analysis (Fig 6D).
Different members of the MliC/PliC family have been implicated in bacterial pathogenesis
[8]. However, studies which demonstrate their expression in vivo are lacking to date. There-
fore, we next sought to examine expression of SliC during N. gonorrhoeae colonization of the
female mouse vaginal tract. Female BALB/c mice were infected with wild type FA1090 and
vaginal washes were collected at days 1, 3, and 5 post-infection and pooled. Equal numbers of
bacterial cells (CFUs) were separated by SDS-PAGE and probed with anti-SliC antisera. These
studies showed that SliC was readily produced throughout the 5-day infection period (Fig 6E).
Densitometry analyses using SliC abundance on day 1 as a reference showed that the amounts
of SliC lowered to 0.73 fold on day 3 postinfection and increased to 1.46 fold on day 5 when
compared to the amount of SliC detected on day 1.
Cumulatively, these experiments demonstrated that N. gonorrhoeae stably produces SliC
during different growth conditions in vitro and provide the first evidence for the expression of
a MliC/PliC protein in vivo, suggesting that maintenance of this lysozyme c inhibitor is impor-
tant during infection.
SliC provides a significant survival advantage for N. gonorrhoeae during
mucosal infection
To test the potential significance of SliC in gonococcal virulence, we performed preliminary in
vivo competitive infection experiments with the ΔsliC mutant and the wild type parent strain
in the female mouse model of gonococcal genital tract infection. In two independent experi-
ments, the lack of SliC caused a dramatic 10, 250, and 167-fold attenuation of N. gonorrhoeae
colonization on days 1, 3, and 5 post-infection, respectively (S3 Fig).
We next conducted competitive infection experiments in which the ΔsliC mutant and the
ΔsliC/P::sliC and ΔsliC/P::sliC� mutants were competed with the wild type strain in parallel.
The competitive indices obtained for all strains did not differ during in vitro co-culture (Fig
Aliquots of the lysates were plated on solid media. Results are expressed as the number of CFUs recovered after
gentamycin treatment (n = 3; mean ±SEMs). The numbers of adherent and internalized bacteria between analyzed
strains and wild type N. gonorrhoeae were not statistically significant (ns).

reduction in the relative number of CFUs recovered from vaginal swabs for the ΔsliC knockout
and ΔsliC/P::sliC� mutant (Fig 7B–7D, respectively). The recovery of the ΔsliC mutant was
approximately 2-, 58-, and 34-fold (geometric mean CIs) lower than the wild type strain on
days 1, 3, and 5 post-inoculation, respectively (Fig 7B). The fitness disadvantage was

Expression of SliC was examined in whole-cell extracts derived from wild type FA1090 incubated for 3 h at 37˚ C with
increasing concentrations of human lysozyme (0, 10, 100, and 1000 μg/mL) and lactoferrin (3 mg/mL). (E) Groups of
BALB/C mice were inoculated intra-vaginally with 106 CFUs of wild type FA1090. Vaginal swabs were collected on
days 1, 3, and 5 post-inoculation and suspended in 100 μL of liquid media. Serial dilutions of vaginal swabs were
cultured quantitatively on agar with streptomycin to enumerate the recovered CFUs while aliquots of the same
suspensions were prepared for SDS-PAGE by the addition of lysis buffer. For experiments shown in panels A-D,
samples containing the whole-cell lysates were matched by equivalent OD600 units; for experiments reported in panel
E, samples were matched by the same CFUs. All samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto
nitrocellulose. Immunoblots were performed using polyclonal rabbit antisera against SliC (A-E) and MetQ (B). SliC
abundance relative to day 1 postinfection, determined by densitometry analysis, is denoted below the immunoblot.

 Fig 7. SliC provides a significant survival advantage for N. gonorrhoeae during mucosal infection and the virulence defect is dependent on the
lysozyme inhibition function. (A) In vitro competition assays were executed in liquid media concurrently with three sets of strains: wild type and ΔsliC,
wild type and ΔsliC/P::sliC, or wild type and ΔsliC/P::sliC�. Equivalent CFUs (106 CFUs) of each strain were inoculated into liquid media and the CFU
output was assessed at 2, 4, and 6 h post-inoculation. (B-D) Groups of BALB/c mice were inoculated intravaginally with wild-type FA1090 combined
with similar CFUs (total dose, 106 CFU N. gonorrhoeae; 7 mice/group) of isogenic ΔsliC (B), ΔsliC/P::sliC (C), or ΔsliC/P::sliC� (D). Vaginal swabs were
collected on days 1, 3, and 5 post-inoculation and suspended in liquid media. Vaginal swab suspensions and inocula were cultured quantitatively on agar
with streptomycin (total number of CFUs) and solid media with streptomycin and kanamycin to enumerate ΔsliC, ΔsliC/P::sliC, or ΔsliC/P::sliC�. Results
are expressed as the competitive index (CI) using the equation CI = [mutant CFU (output)/wild-type CFU (output)]/[mutant CFU (input)/wild-type
CFU (input)]. The limit of detection of 1 CFU was assigned for a strain that was not recovered from an infected mouse. A CI of <1 indicates that the
mutant is less fit than the wild type strain. All experiments were performed in biological triplicates and geometric means are shown. Statistical analysis

 exacerbated for the ΔsliC/P::sliC� bacteria, with averages of 34, 270, and 2,375-fold lower than
for wild type gonococci on days 1, 3, and 5 post-infection, respectively (Fig 7D). In contrast,
the defect was fully restored by genetic complementation in the ΔsliC/P::sliC strain (Fig 7C).
When Kruskal-Wallis Dunn’s multiple comparison tests were performed to compare statistical
significance of CIs between the ΔsliC/wild type and ΔsliC/P::sliC/wild type, the values were
>0.99, 0.027, and 0.77 on days 1, 3, and 5 post-inoculation. The calculated p values for the
ΔsliC/P::sliC�/wild type versus ΔsliC/P::sliC/wild type were all significant and reached 0.029,
0.0058, and 0.016.
To test the basis for the attenuation of ΔsliC bacteria relative to wild type, we next conducted
competitive infections in mice that were genetically defective for lysozyme using C57BL/6J mice
as the background controls. Data from two combined experiments showed that the relative
recovery of the ΔsliC mutant from C57/BL6J mice was approximately 3-, 372-, and 198-fold
lower (geometric mean CIs) than the wild type strain on days 1, 3, and 5 post-inoculation,
respectively (Fig 7E). In contrast, the ΔsliC mutant was recovered at the same level as the wild
type strain in mice that lack lysozyme on days 1 and 3, while on day 5 the geometric mean CI
was 10-fold lower than the wild type strain (Fig 7F). The difference in the CIs in C57BL/6J mice
and lysozyme knockout mice was statistically different on day 3 (p value of 0.03).
Only two reports to date examined the in vivo role of lysozyme inhibitors in bacterial viru-
lence [13, 14] but it has never been dissected whether the virulence defects observed were
dependent on the lysozyme inhibition function. Together these studies demonstrated that SliC
provides a significant fitness benefit to N. gonorrhoeae in the murine model and offered the
first evidence that a proteinaceous lysozyme c inhibitor is important during in vivo infection
solely due to its ability to bind and inactivate lysozyme.
Discussion
To establish infection, microbes must evade a combination of host antimicrobial peptides and
enzymes, including lysozymes, which are abundantly secreted by the epithelium and produced
within professional phagocytes [32]. Described for the first time by Alexander Fleming in 1922
as a substance with the ability to “lyse” bacteria, lysozyme additionally acts as an antimicrobial
peptide by interacting directly with cell membranes via its positively charged amino acids [33].
Pathogenic and commensal bacteria have developed many methods to evade lysozyme; how-
ever, until the recently reported ACP [9], no proteinaceous lysozyme inhibitor has been
described for the genus Neisseria. ACP is a surface-exposed meningococcal adhesin that
induces cross-strain bactericidal antibodies [30]. Despite low primary sequence homology, the
apo crystal structure of N. meningitidis ACP resembles an eight-stranded antiparallel ß-barrel
similar in the overall fold to those of MliC/PliC proteins [9, 11, 12, 19]. In vitro assays have
demonstrated that ACP proteins act as inhibitors of HEWL and HL, contributing to lysozyme
tolerance in the presence of the membrane-permeabilizing agent lactoferrin [9, 30]. Neverthe-
less, the importance of lysozyme inhibition for host colonization has not been addressed in
Neisseria and investigations in other bacterial species are also sparse [13, 14].
In this report, we demonstrated for the first time that inhibition of lysozyme activity is piv-
otal for N. gonorrhoeae mucosal infection in the female genital tract. Through genetic,
was performed using Kruskal-Wallis Dunn’s multiple comparison tests to compare statistical significance of CIs between the ΔsliC/wild type and ΔsliC/
P::sliC/wild type as well as ΔsliC/P::sliC�/wild type and ΔsliC/P::sliC/wild type. (E-F) Competitive infections were also performed with mixtures of wild
type FA1090 and similar numbers of isogenic ΔsliC in C57BL/6J (E) and B6.129P2-Lyz2tm1(cre)Ifo/J 9 mice (F), which do not produce lysozyme.
Results from two experiments were combined. Statistical analysis was performed using Mann-Whitney test to compare statistical significance of CIs
between the ΔsliC/wild type in C57BL/6J and ΔsliC/wild type in lysozyme knockout mice. For all experiments, red symbols indicate mice from which no
wild type bacteria were recovered, while open symbols designate no mutant CFUs were recovered.

 biochemical, in vitro and in vivo functional assays, we characterized a previously unrecognized
surface-exposed protein, SliC, that plays a role in virulence as a weapon to counteract c-type
lysozyme and contributes to N. gonorrhoeae colonization. We originally identified SliC
(NGO1063) as a potential vaccine/drug candidate in quantitative proteomic surveys of the N.
gonorrhoeae cell envelopes and naturally released membrane vesicles [15, 16].
We found that SliC belongs to the MliC/PliC family of lysozyme inhibitors (Fig 1) and is
actually closer to subgroup 1 MliCs, represented by E. coli MliC, than to subgroup 2 MliCs,
represented by P. aeruginosa MliC (Fig 1A). SliC possesses the FWSKG motif commonly pres-
ent in subgroup 1 MliCs and does not have any of the conserved hydrophobic residues charac-
teristic of subgroup 2 [10, 14]. Our phylogenetic analysis, however, demonstrated that
Neisseria SliC and ACP, despite their low primary amino acid sequence identity (S1 Table),
were more closely related to each other than either protein was to MliC/PliC lysozyme inhibi-
tors from other bacteria (Fig 1B).
MliC proteins are found anchored to the periplasmic side of the outer membrane, whereas
PliC family members are localized in the periplasm [8]. In our proteomic investigations, SliC
was found in cell envelopes and naturally released membrane vesicles [15]. We confirmed
these initial observations by performing sub-cellular fractionation experiments coupled with
immunoblotting using antisera specific to SliC as well as control protein markers (Fig 2D). In
addition, we showed by two independent approaches–protease accessibility studies (Fig 2E)
and immunodotting (Fig 2F)–that SliC is a surface-displayed lipoprotein, which we predicted
earlier with in silico approaches [15]. Similarly, the Mycobacterium tuberculosis lysozyme
inhibitor, LprI, is a surface-exposed lipoprotein [34]. Surface-localization of ACP and SliC
appears to be another smart strategy employed by Neisseria to guard against the devastating
action of lysozyme before it traverses the outer membrane, which is facilitated by the permea-
bilizing action of other host antimicrobial peptides. The conservation and expression of SliC
throughout phases of growth, in conditions relevant to different micro-niches of the human
host, during experimental infection of female mice, and among diverse gonococcal isolates, as
well as in N. meningitidis, N. lactamica, and N. weaveri, further highlights the importance of
maintaining this surface-exposed outer membrane protein in pathogenic, commensal and
opportunistic Neisseria (Figs 1C–1F, 6 and S1–S2).
To better understand the mechanism of lysozyme inhibition, different biochemical
approaches were utilized for several members of the MliC/PliC family and for ACP [8, 9, 11,
12, 14, 18, 19, 34]. Our studies with untagged rSliC demonstrated that SliC inhibits both
HEWL and HL (Fig 3A and 3B) but is a more potent inhibitor of HL (Fig 3C) with a calculated
IC50 of 1.85 μM. Similar observations have been made for N. meningitidis ACP [9]. Site-
directed mutagenesis of the two residues in SliC corresponding to the sites of P. aeruginosa
MliC interaction with HEWL [11], S83 and K103, led to complete abrogation of lysozyme
hydrolytic activity (Fig 3D), suggesting that SliC employs a similar mode of lysozyme inhibi-
tion as MliC proteins. To further evaluate the SliC-HL interaction, BLI was utilized, which
yielded a calculated KD value of 9.2 ± 1.9 μM (average ± SEM; Fig 3F). This result suggests a
moderate binding of SliC to HL in vitro, which is very similar to the ACP-HL interaction, with
a KD of 11 μM. Intriguingly, MliC from Brucella abortus shows a thousand-fold higher binding
affinity [12]. It is likely that SliC and ACP lysozyme binding affinities are influenced by the
presence of peptidoglycan, the lysozyme substrate.
Our complementary biochemical approaches demonstrated that SliC is an inhibitor of c-
type lysozyme (Fig 3); however, exposure of N. gonorrhoeae to HL did not result in any signifi-
cant differences in bacterial viability in comparison to the wild type strain (Fig 4C). We con-
cluded that other mechanisms employed by N. gonorrhoeae to resist killing by lysozyme, ACP
and lytic transglycosylases, for example [9, 26, 27], compensated for the lack of SliC and were

 sufficient to provide resistance in vitro. Deletion of acp did not render the bacteria more sensi-
tive to lysozyme (Fig 4C), which was in contrast to an earlier observation [9, 26, 27] perhaps
due to differences between gonococcal isolates. It is plausible that a positive feedback loop
exists between ACP and SliC that provides increased levels of ACP upon decreases in SliC
expression. Supporting this conclusion, removal of both SliC and ACP rendered the bacteria
remarkably sensitive to lysozyme, which was entirely complemented in the Δacp ΔsliC/P::acp
P::sliC strain (Fig 4C).
Most importantly, SliC and its lysozyme inhibition function conferred a fitness advantage
to N. gonorrhoeae in vivo, which we demonstrated in preliminary competition experiments
with the ΔsliC mutant against wild type during co-infection in the murine female genital tract
(S3 Fig) and in biological triplicate studies (Fig 7B–7D), in which the ΔsliC/P::sliC� mutant
strain, in addition to ΔsliC and the complemented strain, ΔsliC/P::sliC, were challenged against
equal numbers of wild type bacteria. A drastic decrease in ΔsliC fitness in vivo was observed
(Fig 7B), which was further exacerbated for the ΔsliC/P::sliC� bacteria, which expresses a func-
tionally inactivated SliC protein (Fig 7D). This statistically significant drop in fitness was not
caused by altered LOS (Fig 4E), cell morphology (Fig 4F), or other potential defects in the
outer membrane integrity in cells lacking SliC, as no significant differences were observed
between wild type and ΔsliC bacteria in sensitivity to seven antibacterial compounds with dif-
ferent modes of action (S2 Table). Further, bacterial fitness could be fully restored by genetic
complementation in the ΔsliC/P::sliC strain (Fig 7C). Nor was the defect triggered by instability
or affected transport of SliC� to the gonococcal cell surface, as the mutated protein was stably
expressed from its native promoter (Fig 2C) and efficiently escorted to the gonococcal cell sur-
face (Fig 2F). No significant changes in the numbers of adherent and internalized bacteria
were found in our in vitro studies (Fig 5) eliminating SliC as an adhesin. Finally, our studies
involving lysozyme defective mice (Fig 7E and 7F) further support SliC as a critical inhibitor of
lysozyme during infection. Lysozyme is detected in the human cervico-vaginal fluid proteome
and may be of either phagocytic or epithelial origin [35–38].
Taken together, our studies provide the first evidence that a novel lysozyme-binding lipo-
protein of N. gonorrhoeae, SliC, plays a critical role during colonization of the host. Lysozyme
is a major host defense factor against bacteria. Therefore, a detailed understanding of the
mechanisms that bacteria have developed to fight lysozyme may allow development of new
antimicrobial strategies against pathogens and also against certain microbiota during
dysbiosis.
Materials and methods
Bacterial strains and growth conditions
Neisseria utilized in this study include N. gonorrhoeae FA1090 [39] and 36 temporally and geo-
graphically diverse gonococcal clinical isolates with the 2016 WHO N. gonorrhoeae reference
strains [16, 40], N. meningitidis MC58 [41], N. lactamica NL1983/-01, and N. weaveri 1032
[42]. Neisseria were removed from frozen stocks and plated on gonococcal base solid medium
(GCB, Difco) and incubated in a 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37˚C for 18–20 h. Transparent, non-
piliated colonies were subcultured onto GCB. After passage on GCB, bacteria were cultured in
gonococcal base liquid (GCBL) medium supplemented with Kellogg’s supplement I in 1:100
and 12.5 μM ferric nitrate [43, 44]. To achieve iron-limited conditions, GCB without ferric
nitrate and with deferoxamine mesylate salt (Desferal, Sigma) at 5 μM final concentration was
utilized [45]. In addition, when stated in the text, GCB supplemented with 7.5% normal
human serum [46] was used. For anaerobic growth, bacteria were plated on GCB with 1.2 μM
nitrite as a terminal electron acceptor and harvested after 48 h [16]. Except where otherwise

 indicated, colonies were collected from plates with a polyester-tipped sterile applicator (Puri-
tan) and suspended to an OD600 of 0.1 in GCBL supplemented with 0.042% sodium bicarbon-
ate and supplements as above [43, 44]. Liquid cultures were propagated at 37˚C with shaking
for 3 h, back-diluted to an OD600 of 0.1 in supplemented GCBL, and cultured in the same man-
ner. Piliated colonies were used for transformation and adhesion/invasion assays while non-
piliated variants were utilized in all other experiments.
Escherichia coli strains were grown either on Luria-Bertani agar (LBA, Difco) or cultured in
Luria-Bertani broth (LB, Difco) at 37˚C.
Antibiotics were used in the following concentrations: for N. gonorrhoeae: kanamycin
40 μg/mL, erythromycin 0.5 μg/mL, chloramphenicol 0.5 μg/mL, streptomycin 100 μg/mL; for
E. coli: kanamycin 50 μg/mL, carbenicillin 50 μg/mL, chloramphenicol 34 μg/mL.
Genetic manipulations and site directed mutagenesis
Cloning procedures were performed in E. coli MC1061 [47]. N. gonorrhoeae FA1090
(NC_002946) genomic DNA was isolated using the Wizard Genomic DNA Purification Kit
(Promega). Oligonucleotides were designed using SnapGene software version 2.8 (GSL Bio-
tech LLC) and synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies. Q5 High-Fidelity DNA polymer-
ase, DNA ligase and NEBuilder HiFi DNA Assembly Master Mix were purchased from New
England Biolabs (NEB). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using Q5 Site-Directed
Mutagenesis Kit (NEB). All obtained genetic constructs were verified by Sanger Sequencing at
the Center for Genomic Research and Biocomputing at Oregon State University. Transforma-
tion of N. gonorrhoeae was performed as described previously [48].
To create an in-frame knockout of sliC, individual 500 bp fragments upstream (sliC_up)
and downstream (sliC_down) of sliC were amplified using primer pairs 5’ACGTTGAGAATTC
GCCGTCTGAGTCGGAATATGTCGGAGC3’, 5’AGCGTACAGGTACCAGCGCGAAAAACCTGAT
A3’, and 5’ACTCAATAGGATCCCGAAACTTCCTGCCGC3’,5’ACTCGGTCAAGCTTCATTG
GATACCGACAATGAAAC3’. The obtained sliC_up and sliC_down PCR products were
digested with EcoRI/KpnI and BamHI/HindIII, respectively. Subsequently, sliC_up was
cloned into similarly digested pUC18K, yielding pUC18K-upsliC and sliC_down was cloned
into this genetic construct to yield pUC18K-ΔsliC. This plasmid was digested with ScaI and
used for liquid transformation of N. gonorrhoeae FA1090 [48]. The sliC knockout was verified
using primers 5'GGTTGGCGATGTAGAGGCT3’ and 5'GATTGCAGTTACAACGCGTGG3'
and chromosomal DNA isolated from wild type FA1090 as controls, as well as immunoblot-
ting analysis with anti-SliC antisera of the whole cell lysates obtained from wild type and ΔsliC.
An in frame and markerless knockout of acp was achieved using Gibson assembly method
[49]. Briefly, pNEB193 and DNA fragments comprising 1000 bp upstream and downstream
from acp gene were amplified using primers: 5’GTTTAAACCTGCAGGCATGCAAG3’, 5’TCT
AGACTTAATTAAGGATCCGGCG3’, 5’CGCCGGATCCTTAATTAAGTCTAGAACAAGCCGCTC

ATTTC3’, 5’AGCTTGCATGCCTGCAGGTTTAAACCGCCGATACCCGCAACCC5’ and Q5
polymerase. The obtained DNA fragments were purified and assembled using Hi-Fi Assembly
Mix (NEB) to create pNEB-Δacp plasmid. This plasmid was linearized with ScaI and used for
spot transformation of N. gonorrhoeae FA1090. The FA1090 Δacp knockout was confirmed by
PCR reaction using primers 5’GACCGGGATGAACCAGATAG3’ and 5’GG
CTGATGCACCAATGCTTC3’.
The FA1090 Δacp knockout strain and pUC18K-ΔsliC were used to create the isogenic
Δacp ΔsliC double mutant. Briefly, pUC18K-ΔsliC was cut with ScaI and used for spot

 transformation of N. gonorrhoeae FA1090 Δacp. The deletion of sliC in Δacp ΔsliC double
knockout was confirmed by PCR with the primer pair: 5'GGTTGGCGATGTAGAGGCT3’ and
5'GATTGCAGTTACAACGCGTGG3', as well as by probing whole cell lysates obtained from
wild type and ΔacpΔsliC in immunoblotting analysis with anti-SliC antisera.
Constructs for complementation of ΔsliC with the wild type sliC allele or sliC� (carrying ala-
nine substitutions in S83 and K103) and for production of recombinant proteins, rSliC and
rSliC�, were designed as outlined in Fig 2A using the following steps. First, sliC was amplified
with its native promoter using primers 5’GATCTTAATTAATTCAGACGGCATCGTCAGGC3’
and 5’GATCGTTTAAACTCAAACAGGCTGCCCCGT3’.The resulting PCR product was
digested with PacI/PmeI and cloned into similarly treated pNEB193, yielding pNEB-sliC. To
create sliC�, the S83A substitution was introduced with primers 5’CGTTGCCGCAGCTGGCG
AACGCT3’ and 5’TCGGAAGAGAGGACGGCACG3’ using pNEB-sliC as template. The K103A
mutation was generated in SliC S83A using primers 5’GTGGCACCAGGCTGGCGGCGAAG3’
and 5’TCGGTTCCGTTTCCGAAC3’.
To create constructs for complementation of ΔsliC, pNEB-sliC and pNEB-sliC� were treated
with PacI/PmeI and DNA fragments corresponding to sliC and sliC�, respectively, were cloned
into similarly digested pGCC5 [50]. The obtained plasmids, pGCC5-sliC and pGCC5-sliC�,
were introduced to FA1090 ΔsliC. The presence of the integrated recombinant genes was con-
firmed in transformants by PCR, and the level of SliC expression was confirmed by immuno-
blotting with anti-SliC antisera.
To complement the Δacp mutant, the acp gene with its native promoter was PCR amplified
using primers 5’GATCGTCGACCCATATCGAATGCCTCGA3’and 5’GATCTTAATTAAGGA
ACGGTCAAAAAACAGC3’.The resulting DNA fragment was digested with PacI and cloned
into PacI/PmeI digested pGCC5 plasmid to yield pGCC5-acp. This plasmid was introduced into
FA1090 Δacp by transformation and the presence of the integrated acp was confirmed by PCR.
To complement the FA1090 ΔacpΔsliC double knockout strain, pGCC5-acpsliC plasmid
carrying both genes under control of their native promoters was constructed as follows: acp
gene and 240 bp upstream from its start codon was amplified by PCR using the primer pair
5’GATCGTCGACCCATATCGAATGCCTCGA3’and 5’GATCTTAATTAAGGAACGGTCAAAA
AACAGC3’. The resulting DNA fragment was digested with SalI/PacI and cloned into simi-
larly cut pGCC5-sliC to yield pGCC5-acpsliC used for spot transformation of FA1090 ΔacpΔs-
liC. The presence of acp and sliC alleles in heterologous location was subsequently confirmed
by PCR and their functionality was verified by immunoblotting and complementation studies.
Constructs used for production of recombinant wild type SliC (rSliC) and SliC bearing
S83A K103A substitutions (rSliC�), both lacking a signal peptide and containing a C-terminal
Tobacco Etch Virus (TEV) protease cleavage site followed by a 6×His-tag, were created by
amplifying sliC and sliC� with primers 5’CGTAATGCCATGGTGCCGGAAGCGTATGATGGC3’
and 5’AGTCAGCAAGCTTACGGGCGCGGCAGG3’ using pNEB-sliC and pNEB-sliC� as tem-
plates, respectively. The obtained PCR products were digested with NcoI/HindIII and cloned
into pRSF-NT [51].
Protein purification
Recombinant SliC and SliC� were purified from 3 L cultures of E. coli BL21(DE3) [52] carrying
pRSF-rSliC and pRSF-rSliC�, respectively. Bacterial cultures were incubated at 37˚C until
OD600 of 0.7 and induced with 0.5 mM IPTG. The cultures were incubated overnight at 16˚C
and the cells were pelleted at 8,000 × g for 15 min. Cells were suspended in lysis buffer (20 mM
HEPES pH 7.5, 500 mM NaCl, 10 mM imidazole) and lysed by passing four times through
French Press at 1,500 psi. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 17,000 × g for 20 min

 and the cleared lysate was applied to a 5 mL IMAC column (BioRad). Proteins were purified
using a NGC Medium-Pressure Liquid Chromatography System (BioRad) using lysis buffer
and elution buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 500 mM NaCl, 250 mM imidazole). Fractions con-
taining either rSliC or rSliC� were pooled and the buffer was supplemented with DTT and
EDTA to final concentrations of 1mM and 0.5 mM, respectively. The His-tag was removed by
overnight incubation at 4˚C with TEV protease in a 1:25 ratio. The samples were concentrated
using a Vivaspin 20 centrifuge concentrator (GE HealthCare) and subjected to size exclusion
chromatography using a HiLoad 16/600 Superdex 75 pg column (GE HealthCare) with phos-
phate buffered saline (PBS) as running buffer to separate SliC and SliC� from TEV protease.
Protein purity was confirmed by SDS PAGE and the protein concentration was measured
using the BioRad DC Protein Assay Kit.
Antibody generation
Polyclonal antisera against purified rSliC were prepared by Pacific Immunology Corp. using a
13-week antibody production protocol and two New Zealand White rabbits under Animal
Protocol #1 approved by IACUC and the NIH Animal Welfare Assurance Program (#A4182-
01) in a certified animal facility (USDA 93-R-283).
Lysozyme activity assay
The EnzChek Lysozyme Assay kit (ThermoFisher) was used to determine the SliC-mediated
inhibition of c-type lysozyme from chicken egg white (HEWL, Sigma) and human lysozyme
(HL, Sigma). Assays were conducted using 96 well plates and 100 μL volumes of 0.1 M sodium
phosphate, 0.1 M NaCl, pH 7.5 and 2 mM sodium azide as buffer. Experimental samples con-
taining 2.5 μM of either HEWL or HL were incubated with increasing concentrations of SliC
(0–10 μM) for 30 min at 37˚C. The control wells contained HEWL or HL alone. After incuba-
tion, the reaction was initiated by addition of 50 μL of the 50 μg/mL DQ lysozyme substrate.
The reaction was monitored for 1 h using a Synergy HT Microplate Reader (BioTek) at excita-
tion and emission wavelengths of 485 nm and 530 nm, respectively. To calculate the IC50,
results were exported to GraphPad Prism 6 (GraphPad Software). To test the inhibition of HL
by SliC�, 2.5 μM of HL and 5 μM of the protein was used.
Comparison of SliC inhibition of chicken and human lysozyme was assessed by incubation
of 2.5 μM final lysozyme solution with increasing concentrations of SliC (0–10 μM). After mix-
ing the proteins, the assay was performed as described above.
BioLayer interferometry
The binding affinity of SliC to lysozyme was assessed by BLI on an OctetRed 96 (ForteBio).
The SliC protein was randomly biotinylated on surface-exposed lysine side chains with succi-
nimidyl-6-(biotinamido)hexanoate, a biotin label with a medium chain length spacer arm, per
manufacturer’s instructions (EZ- Link NHS-LC-Biotin, Pierce). SliC was incubated with a
20-fold molar excess of biotin reagent 1 h at room temperature, and protein was subsequently
applied to a PD10 column to remove excess biotin reagent. The SliC and HL samples were pre-
pared in Kinetic Buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 8, 15 mM NaCl, 0.002 Tween 20, 0.1 mg/mL BSA).
Streptavidin (SA) biosensors (ForteBio) were loaded with biotinylated SliC for 10 min at a
20 μg/mL concentration. Unloaded tips were used as a control. The baseline was established
for 240 s and the association and dissociation steps were performed for 600 s. Experiments
were performed in three biological replicates with curve fitting using a 2:1 (Heterogeneous
Ligand) model. KD value calculations were completed using Octet Data Analysis (version 9).

 Assessment of subcellular localization
Subcellular fractionation procedures, dot-blots and protease shaving assays were conducted as
described previously [16]. Briefly, extraction of proteins from the cytosolic, cell envelope, mem-
brane vesicle, and soluble supernatant fractions was performed using 500 mL cultures of wild
type N. gonorrhoeae FA1090 at mid-logarithmic phase of growth. Cell envelope proteins were
separated from cytoplasmic fraction by a sodium carbonate extraction procedure and differential
centrifugation, while culture supernatants were subjected to filtration and ultracentrifugation to
separate naturally-released membrane vesicles from soluble proteins. After centrifugation, the
soluble protein fraction was precipitated at 4˚C for 1 h using 15% trichloroacetic acid.
In experiments involving proteinase K shaving and immunodotting, intact bacterial cells
were used [16]. For protease accessibility studies, N. gonorrhoeae FA1090 wild type was sub-
cultured in GCBL for 3 h after collecting from solid media, diluted to OD600 of 0.1 and cul-
tured until OD600 of ~ 1.0 was reached. Gonococci were gently centrifuged and suspended to
OD600 of 2.0 in sterile PBS (pH 8.0) supplemented with 5 mM MgCl2. Bacterial suspensions
(500 μL) were incubated for 1 h at 37˚C with proteinase K at final concentrations of 0, 20, or
40 μg/mL. To deactivate protease, 10 μL of 50 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) was
added. Bacteria were then washed with GCBL, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and probed with poly-
clonal antisera to determine protease susceptibility.
For immunodotting, N. gonorrhoeae strains were suspended in GCBL to an OD600 of 0.1,
cultured under standard growth conditions for 3 h, harvested, and spotted as 5 μL suspensions
onto nitrocellulose membranes after adjusting the OD600 to 2.0. The samples were dried at
room temperature for 15 min and subjected to immunoblotting as described below. For assess-
ing the expression of SliC during experimental murine infection, five mice were infected vagi-
nally with strain FA1090 and vaginal washes were collected on days 1, 3 and 5 post-bacterial
inoculation by pipetting 40 μl of sterile PBS in and out of the vaginas. This procedure was
repeated three times for each mouse, and the resultant fluids from each time point were pooled.
Lysozyme-lactoferrin treatment assays
Non piliated cells of wild type FA1090, ΔsliC, ΔsliC complemented with sliC, Δacp, Δacp com-
plemented with acp, ΔsliC Δacp, and ΔsliC Δacp complemented with sliC and acp were sus-
pended in GCBL with Kellogg’s supplements and 0.042% sodium bicarbonate to OD600 of 0.1
and cultured at 37˚C for 3 h. Bacteria were diluted to 1×104 CFU/mL and 170 μL of each cul-
ture was incubated for 8 h at 37˚C with lactoferrin (5 mg/mL; InVitria) and increasing concen-
trations of human lysozyme (0, 1, 5, 10 and 20 mg/mL; BioVision) in a final volume of 200 μL.
Bacterial suspensions were plated for CFUs scoring. All experiments were performed in 5 bio-
logical replicates and means with corresponding SEMs are presented.
To test if the presence of cell envelope permeating agents increases the lysozyme sensitivity
of gonococci, Polymyxin B (100 U/mL), Tween 20 (0.001%), or bile salts (0.05%) reconstituted
in GCBL were added alone or in combination, as indicated, to bacterial cell suspensions
(1×104 CFU/mL) containing lactoferrin (5 mg/mL) and lysozyme (5 mg/mL) as described
above. We established in preliminary studies that to obtain viable bacteria, cultures can be
incubated at 37˚ in the presence of all these antimicrobials up to 4 h. Accordingly, after that
time period mixtures were serially diluted and spotted on GCB to enumerate CFUs. All experi-
ments were performed in 3 independent trials and means with corresponding SEMs are
presented.

 Fitness assessments under in vitro growth conditions
The growth kinetics of wild type N. gonorrhoeae FA1090 and isogenic ΔsliC, ΔsliC/P::sliC, and
ΔsliC/P::sliC� mutants were conducted in GCBL under standard growth conditions. Bacteria
were collected from GCB and suspended in GCBL to an OD600 of 0.1. Following 3 h of incuba-
tion at 37˚C with aeration bacterial cultures were back-diluted to OD600 of 0.1 in fresh GCBL
and cultured for additional 6 h. Samples were withdrawn for OD600 measurements and immu-
noblotting every hour (n = 4; mean ±SEMs).
To assess the viability of N. gonorrhoeae lacking sliC during host-relevant in vitro growth
conditions, colonies of wild type FA1090 and ΔsliC were collected from GCB, suspended in
GCBL to an OD600 of 0.1, and cultured for 3 h at 37˚C with aeration. Subsequently, the cul-
tures were normalized to OD600 = 0.2, serially diluted, and plated on solid media for standard
growth conditions (SGC), iron limiting conditions, NHS, and anaerobic conditions, as
described above. The CFUs were scored after 22 and 48 h for aerobic and anaerobic condi-
tions, respectively (n = 3; mean ±SEMs).
Electron microscopy
N. gonorrhoeae FA1090 wild type and isogenic ΔsliC, ΔsliC/P::sliC, Δacp, and ΔacpΔsliC were
incubated in GCBL until strains reached mid-logarithmic growth. Cells were pelleted at 4,000 ×
g for 3 min and washed twice with PBS filtered through 0.1 μm filter. Bacteria were suspended
in PBS and 2.5 μL of the cell suspensions were spotted onto 300 mesh copper grids. Cells were
allowed to attach to the grid for 15 min and excess PBS was removed. Gonococci were nega-
tively stained using phosphotungstic acid. Images were acquired using a FEI Helios NanoLab
650 electron microscope at the Oregon State University Electron Microscopy Facility.
Isolation of LOS and silver staining
LOS was isolated from N. gonorrhoeae as described previously [53]. Bacteria were collected
from GCB plates incubated at 37˚C and 5% CO2 for 18 h and resuspended in GCBL to final
OD600 of 0.2. Cell suspensions (1.5 mL) were collected and bacteria were lysed by addition of
50 μL of lysis buffer (2% SDS, 4% β-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, 1M Tris-HCl pH 6.8, and
0.01% bromophenol blue) and incubation at 100˚C for 10 min. Samples were cooled to room
temperature and proteins were digested by addition of 25 μg proteinase K in 10 μL of lysis
buffer for 1 h at 60˚C. Isolated LOS was resolved on 18% SDS-PAGE gels and visualized by a
silver staining procedure [54].
Adhesion and invasion assays
Human cervical epidermal carcinoma (ME180, ATCC HTB-33) cells were maintained in
McCoy’s 5A Medium (Iwakata and Grace Modified; Corning) supplemented with 10% heat
inactivated Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS; Gemini Bio-Products). Epithelial cells were seeded in 24
well plates (Greiner BioOne) at 1×105 cells/well and incubated overnight at 37˚C in 5% CO2.
N. gonorrhoeae strains were grown for 18 h. Bacteria were suspended in McCoy’s 5A Medium
supplemented with 10% heat inactivated FBS and containing 0.5 × Kellogg’s supplements. Bac-
teria were added to the epithelial cells at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10:1 for 1, 2, 3,
and 4 h. For adherence assays, cells were washed with PBS and then treated with 1% saponin
for 15 min. Lysates were collected and aliquots plated on GCB. Results are expressed as the
number of CFUs recovered (n=6; mean ±SEMs). For invasion assays, cells were treated with
100 μg/mL of gentamicin for 2 h. After washing the cells extensively, the number of invasive
gonococci was quantified by lysing the cells with 1% saponin for 15 min. Aliquots of the lysates

 were plated on GCB. Results are expressed as the number of CFUs recovered after gentamycin
treatment (n = 3; mean ±SEMs).
Competitive murine infections
Female BALB/c mice (6 to 8 weeks old; Charles River Laboratories Inc., Wilmington, MA;
NCI Frederick strain of inbred BALB/cAnNCr mice, strain code 555) were treated with water-
soluble 17β-estradiol and antibiotics to increase susceptibility to N. gonorrhoeae [55]. Groups
of mice were inoculated vaginally with similar numbers of wild type FA1090 and either iso-
genic ΔsliC, ΔsliC/P::sliC, or ΔsliC/P::sliC� bacteria (total dose, 106 CFU N. gonorrhoeae; 7
mice/group). Vaginal swabs were collected on days 1, 3, and 5 post-inoculation and suspended
in 100 μL GCBL. Vaginal swab suspensions and inocula were cultured quantitatively on GCB
agar with streptomycin (total number of CFUs) and GCB with streptomycin and kanamycin
(ΔsliC, ΔsliC/P::sliC, or ΔsliC/P::sliC� CFU). Results were expressed as the competitive index
(CI) using the equation CI = [mutant CFU (output)/wild-type CFU (output)]/[mutant CFU
(input)/wild-type CFU (input)]. The limit of detection of 1 CFU was assigned for a strain that
was not recovered from an infected mouse. A CI of <1 indicates that the mutant is less fit than
the wild type strain. Preliminary experiments were performed in biological duplicates (shown
in S3 Fig). Final experiments involving competition assays with three pairs of strains, wild type
and ΔsliC, wild type and ΔsliC/P::sliC, or wild type and ΔsliC/P::sliC� were conducted at the
same time and on three separate occasions. Statistical analysis was performed using Kruskal-
Wallis Dunn’s multiple comparison tests to compare significance of CIs between the ΔsliC/
wild type and ΔsliC/P::sliC/wild type as well as ΔsliC/P::sliC�/wild type and ΔsliC/P::sliC/wild
type. Competitive infections were also performed with mixtures of wild-type FA1090 and simi-
lar numbers of isogenic ΔsliC in C57BL/6J and B6.129P2-Lyz2tm1(cre)Ifo/J 9 mice, which do
not produce lysozyme (Jackson Laboratories). Results from two experiments were combined.
Statistical analysis was performed using the Mann-Whitney test to compare statistical signifi-
cance of CIs between the ΔsliC/wild type in C57BL/6J and ΔsliC/wild type in lysozyme knock-
out mice.
E-tests
MICs for cefotaxime, azithromycin, tetracycline, polymyxin B, vancomycin, ampicillin, and
benzylpenicillin were determined using E-tests (Biomerieux) according to the manufacturer’s
recommendations. Each determination was performed on three separate occasions using fresh
bacterial cultures and the consensus MICs obtained in at least two trials were reported.
SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting
Samples of whole cell lysates, protein fractions, intact cells, purified proteins, or vaginal washes
were normalized based on either OD600, protein concentration, or CFUs as specified in the
text. Protein concentration was measured using the DC Protein Assay. SDS-PAGE with load-
ing controls for immunoblotting with differential protein abundances are provided in S4 Fig.
Proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes using a Trans-blot Turbo (Bio-Rad)
and detected by immunoblotting as described previously [16]. The immunoblotting analysis
was performed using polyclonal rabbit antisera with the following dilutions: anti-SliC
(1:20,000), anti-BamA (1:20,000) [16], anti-BamD (1:20,000) [16], anti-SurA (1:10,000) or
anti-Zwf (1:10,000) [56] and secondary goat anti-rabit HRP conjugated antibodies (1:10,000)
(Bio-Rad).

 Densitometry analysis
SliC abundance during wild type FA1090 infection in female BALB/c mice was determined by
densitometry using the volume tool built into Image Lab 5.0 software (Bio-Rad) as described
in [42, 57]. Rectangle tool, local background subtraction, and linear regression method were
used in the calculations. The amount of SliC on day 1 post-infection was arbitrarily set to 1
and the protein abundance on days 3 and 5 is expressed relative to the SliC level detected on
day 1.
Bioinformatics
Amino acid sequence identity of SliC homologs was assessed by aligning sequences down-
loaded from NCBI with the Clustal Omega online tool (Clustal 2.1; https://www.ebi.ac.uk/
Tools/msa/clustalo/) using the default alignment parameters. A subsequent phylogenetic anal-
ysis was performed in Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis (MEGA) version 7.0.26. A
maximum likelihood tree was constructed using the Jones-Taylor-Thornton model [58].
Neighbor-Join and BioNJ algorithms were applied to a pairwise-distance matrix derived from
the JTT model to obtain an initial tree for the heuristic search. The phylogenies were tested by
500 bootstrap iterations, and the tree with the highest log likelihood is presented.
To analyze single nucleotide polymorphisms of sliC (locus NEIP0196), DNA sequences
were compared between 44,028 isolates of all Neisseria spp. and 4990 isolates of N. gonorrhoeae
deposited into the PubMLST database (http://pubmlst.org/neisseria/ as of October 25, 2017
and April 11, 2018; respectively).
Statistical analysis
GraphPad Prism’s build-in t-test was utilized to determine statistically significant differences
between experimental results with the exception of animal studies. A confidence level of 95%
was used for all analyses.
Ethics Statement
Animal experiments were conducted at the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sci-
ences (USUHS) according to the guidelines of the Association for the Assessment and Accred-
itation of Laboratory Animal Care under a protocol # MIC16-488 that was approved by the
University’s Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. The USUHS animal facilities meet
the housing service and surgical standards set forth in the “Guide for the Care and Use of Lab-
oratory Animals” NIH Publication No. 85–23, and the USU Instruction No. 3203, “Use and
Care of Laboratory Animals”. Animals are maintained under the supervision of a full-time vet-
erinarian. For all experiments, mice were humanely euthanized by the laboratory technician
upon reaching the study endpoint using a compressed CO2 gas cylinder in LAM as per the
Uniformed Services University (USU) euthanasia guidelines (IACUC policy 13), which follow
those established by the 2013 American Veterinary Medical Association Panel on Euthanasia
(https://www.usuhs.edu/mps/facilities-resources).

than the wild type strain. All experiments were performed in biological triplicates and geomet-
ric means are shown. Open symbols designate no mutant CFUs recovered.
