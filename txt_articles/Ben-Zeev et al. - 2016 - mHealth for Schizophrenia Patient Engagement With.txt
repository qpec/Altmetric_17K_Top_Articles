Abstract
Background: mHealth interventions that use mobile phones as instruments for illness management are gaining popularity.
Research examining mobile phone‒based mHealth programs for people with psychosis has shown that these approaches are
feasible, acceptable, and clinically promising. However, most mHealth initiatives involving people with schizophrenia have
spanned periods ranging from a few days to several weeks and have typically involved participants who were clinically stable.
Objective: Our aim was to evaluate the viability of extended mHealth interventions for people with schizophrenia-spectrum
disorders following hospital discharge. Specifically, we set out to examine the following: (1) Can individuals be engaged with a
mobile phone intervention program during this high-risk period?, (2) Are age, gender, racial background, or hospitalization history
associated with their engagement or persistence in using a mobile phone intervention over time?, and (3) Does engagement differ
by characteristics of the mHealth intervention itself (ie, pre-programmed vs on-demand functions)?
Methods: We examined mHealth intervention use and demographic and clinical predictors of engagement in 342 individuals
with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders who were given the FOCUS mobile phone intervention as part of a technology-assisted
relapse prevention program during the 6-month high-risk period following hospitalization.
Results: On average, participants engaged with FOCUS for 82% of the weeks they had the mobile phone. People who used
FOCUS more often continued using it over longer periods: 44% used the intervention over 5-6 months, on average 4.3 days a
week. Gender, race, age, and number of past psychiatric hospitalizations were associated with engagement. Females used FOCUS
on average 0.4 more days a week than males. White participants engaged on average 0.7 days more a week than African-Americans
and responded to prompts on 0.7 days more a week than Hispanic participants. Younger participants (age 18-29) had 0.4 fewer
days of on-demand use a week than individuals who were 30-45 years old and 0.5 fewer days a week than older participants (age

 46-60). Participants with fewer past hospitalizations (1-6) engaged on average 0.2 more days a week than those with seven or
more. mHealth program functions were associated with engagement. Participants responded to prompts more often than they
self-initiated on-demand tools, but both FOCUS functions were used regularly. Both types of intervention use declined over time
(on-demand use had a steeper decline). Although mHealth use declined, the majority of individuals used both on-demand and
system-prompted functions regularly throughout their participation. Therefore, neither function is extraneous.
Conclusions: The findings demonstrated that individuals with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders can actively engage with a
clinically supported mobile phone intervention for up to 6 months following hospital discharge. mHealth may be useful in reaching
a clinical population that is typically difficult to engage during high-risk periods.

Introduction
Patients, practitioners, and policy makers are increasingly
enthusiastic about the use of mHealth approaches that can bring
much needed resources (eg, information, assessment, and
treatment) to people with chronic illnesses [1-3]. A recent
meta-analysis of 12 studies conducted in the United States,
Canada, United Kingdom, and India found that across countries
the majority of people with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders
own mobile phones, and many are interested in using them as
tools to support the management of their illness [4]. Research
examining mobile phone‒based mHealth programs for people
with psychosis has shown that these approaches are feasible,
acceptable, and clinically promising [5-10]. However, most
mHealth initiatives involving people with schizophrenia have
spanned periods ranging from a few days to several weeks and
have typically involved participants who were clinically stable.
Schizophrenia has a prolonged and dynamic course typically
consisting of periods of relative stability or remission
interspersed with phases of symptomatic exacerbation that can
last several months [11,12]. The months following hospital
discharge are a particularly vulnerable period during which
individuals are at increased risk for relapse and rehospitalization
[13]. Whether people with schizophrenia are willing and able
to engage in mHealth interventions during this high-risk period
is unclear. On one hand, mHealth approaches are less
constrained by clinic hours, location, or clinician availability
and are therefore more flexible and accessible. On the other,
mHealth programs require autonomous use and are limited in
their personalization and adaptation capacities [14,15].
Consequently, patients might find mHealth interventions to be
too effortful, formulaic, or repetitive and disengage.
With the current study, we set out to evaluate the viability of
extended 
mHealth 
interventions 
for 
people 
with
schizophrenia-spectrum disorders following hospital discharge.
Specifically, we asked the following questions: (1) Can
individuals be engaged with a mobile phone intervention
program during this high-risk period?, (2) Are age, gender,
racial background, and psychiatric hospitalization history
associated with their engagement or persistence in using a
mobile phone intervention over time?, and (3) Does engagement
differ by characteristics of the mHealth intervention itself (ie,
pre-programmed vs on-demand functions)? To address these
questions, we examined mHealth intervention use and
demographic and clinical predictors of engagement in 342
individuals who were given a mobile phone intervention for up
to 6 months as part of a comprehensive technology-assisted
relapse prevention program for people with psychosis following
hospital discharge [16].
Methods
Procedures
The study was approved by the institutional review boards of
the coordinating center, the participating sites, and the
Committee for Protection of Human Subjects at Dartmouth
College. Participants were drawn from a multisite Health
Technology Program (HTP) implementation project that was
conducted in partnership with 10 community mental health
centers and outpatient clinics in eight US states between 2012
and 2015. HTP is described in detail elsewhere [16,17]. Briefly,
the program offered individuals with psychotic disorders the
opportunity to engage in a technology-assisted relapse
prevention program for up to 6 months. As part of HTP, patients
were offered an Android smartphone with the FOCUS [5,18]
illness self-management program installed. Initially, a case
manager introduced the mHealth intervention to patients and
explained how to use the phone functions (eg, call, text, charge
the battery) and FOCUS program (eg, respond to clinical
assessment measures using the touchscreen, select on-demand
tools). Once individuals demonstrated their proficiency, the
case manager engaged them in a shared decision-making process
to identify the three most relevant treatment targets from five
possible FOCUS modules: medication adherence, mood
regulation, sleep, social functioning, and coping with auditory
hallucinations. Once treatment targets were selected, they were
input into the mobile phone and patients could use FOCUS
independently. Participants could call or meet with their case
managers for technical support and troubleshooting. The FOCUS
system 
prompted 
patients 
to 
engage 
in 
a 
brief
assessment/intervention up to three times daily, focusing on
their assigned treatment targets. In addition to pre-scheduled
prompts, participants could access the treatment content for all
five modules without restriction as part of the FOCUS
on-demand functions. The mobile phone transmitted participant
use data to a remote server regularly. Once data were uploaded,
case managers at the different individual sites could view their
assigned participants’ FOCUS activity via a secure online
dashboard. HTP case managers met with participants for relapse

 prevention planning regularly, and data from the dashboard
were available to inform these meetings. Brunette et al describe
in detail the development of the Relapse Prevention Plan in
which FOCUS was embedded [16].
Participants
Individuals were eligible to participate in HTP if they were
diagnosed with a psychotic disorder, were 18-60 years old, and
had been discharged from psychiatric hospitalization within the
past 60 days. The HTP sample consisted of 368 individuals.
Four individuals were offered the FOCUS intervention but
declined. Two individuals received a mobile phone but lost or
sold it before the FOCUS program was activated and so did not
generate mHealth use data. One individual was not offered
FOCUS because his living environment did not permit the use
of a mobile phone. Five individuals dropped out of HTP shortly
after their baseline assessment and did not receive a mobile
phone. Another 14 individuals provided fewer than 7 days of
mobile phone data and were not included in the analyses because
weekly engagement measures could not be calculated for them.
Our final mHealth user sample consists of 342 individuals.
These participants had a mean age of 35 years (SD 11). The
sample was 62.3% (213/342) male, 50.0% (171/342) white,
25.1% (86/342) African-American, 10.8% (37/342) Hispanic,
and 14.0% (48/342) were Asian, American Indian, Native
Hawaiian, or more than one race. The majority (75.7%,
259/342)were single.
Measures
Psychiatric diagnoses were based on medical records at the
community mental health center or outpatient clinic where they
received care and were confirmed by investigators at each site.
Demographic information was collected during a baseline
interview. Participants’ FOCUS use “events” were logged
automatically by the mobile phone and transmitted to a study
server when the device had connectivity. Four engagement
outcomes were calculated for each individual: Days of mHealth
Use represents the number of days a participant used any
FOCUS function during the week. Days Responding to Prompts
represents the number of days a participant responded to
system-initiated prompts during the week. Days of On-Demand
Use represents the number of days a participant initiated FOCUS
use during the week. Average Daily On-Demand Use tallied
how often within a day individuals self-initiated FOCUS
functions. In initial descriptive tables, weekly engagement
measures were summarized at the individual level for the entire
time they participated in the study. Weekly measures were then
characterized over time in longitudinal analyses.
Overview of Analyses
The goal of longitudinal analyses was to estimate engagement
over the course of the study. Participants, however, received
the smartphone intervention for differing amounts of time and
consequently had differing amounts of engagement data.
Engagement data were missing for months without mobile phone
data. Missing data may be a product of participants’
discontinuing FOCUS use prior to the end of the 6-month relapse
prevention program or because they enrolled in HTP with less
than 6 months left before the end of the project (these
participants were informed that they may receive less than the
full “dose” of the intervention when enrolling). For participants
who dropped out prematurely, it is particularly important to
take into account the relationship between available data and
engagement. If a participant was less engaged with the mHealth
intervention, they would be expected to be more likely to
discontinue using it altogether. Therefore, modeling of
engagement must assume missing data is informative on the
engagement outcome values. Jointly modeling the longitudinal
outcomes and the duration of available data allows an unbiased
estimate of the association between predictors and the
longitudinal outcome while appropriately accounting for missing
data. In analyses including all participants (even those with less
than 6 months of data), the results presented are from joint
models. These models fit a longitudinal mixed-effects model
for each engagement outcome simultaneously with a Cox
proportional hazard model of duration of available data.
Subgroup models among only those participants with 5-6 months
of available data were performed via mixed-effects models. All
longitudinal models included linear time terms, and quadratic
time terms were retained if significant. To assess the effect of
demographic factors and engagement, fixed effects were added
to the time-trend models for each of the demographic factors
of interest. Due to significant associations between age and
gender (younger individuals were more likely to be male) and
age and race (older individuals were more likely to be white),
models for each demographic factor were fit separately. All
longitudinal models include random individual-level intercept
and slope terms to account for the correlation of outcomes over
time within individuals.
Results
The majority of participants were able to use the mobile phone
and FOCUS program safely and without difficulty. One
participant reported getting paranoid about the mobile phone
and breaking it. Another participant reported only using it on
“airplane mode” to avoid being tracked. Three participants
deleted the FOCUS program from the phone. Another 21
participants reported their mobile phone lost or stolen over the
course of their participation and requested a replacement device.
One participant accidentally downloaded malware that rendered
the phone inoperative and it needed to be replaced. At least two
devices were pawned by participants.
Table 1 summarizes participant demographics and engagement
rates. Participants included in this analysis had a study mobile
phone for varying timeframes ranging from 8 to 183 days (mean
126 days, SD 52). Most participants (73.6%, 252/342) used the
intervention for 3-6 months. On average, participants used the
FOCUS program for 82% of the weeks they had the device. On
average, participants had 9.5 (SD 7.4) meetings with HTP case
managers in which they engaged in FOCUS-related topics (eg,
device set-up and training, treatment target selection, technical
troubleshooting, modification of prompting schedules,
encouragement to use FOCUS strategies in the context of daily
life).

Individuals who used FOCUS for 5-6 months of the relapse
prevention program (44%) had higher average engagement
throughout their participation than those who used FOCUS for
less time. Their Days of mHealth Use were mean 4.3 (SD 1.8)
per week; Days Responding to Prompts: mean 3.8 (SD 2.0) per
week; Days of On-Demand Use: mean 1.9 (SD 1.5) per week;
and Daily On-Demand Use: mean 1.3 (SD 1.8). In the Cox
proportional hazard portion of the joint models, there was a
significant association between level of engagement and
likelihood of discontinuing use, with higher levels of
engagement associated with lower risk of discontinuation.
Greater number of psychiatric hospitalizations was also
significantly associated with likelihood of discontinuing use,
with a discontinuation hazard ratio of 1.4 (95% CI 1.1-1.8;
P=.004) for 7+ hospitalizations compared to fewer
hospitalizations.
The level of engagement with the mobile phone intervention
declined over time (see Figure 1). The joint model results
including all participants showed a curvilinear decline from an

 average of 3.9 uses in the first week to 1.9 uses in week 24.
Days Responding to Prompts declined linearly and Days of
On-Demand Use declined more steeply initially followed by a
leveling off of use. Mean Days Responding to Prompts in the
first week was 3.1 and in week 24 was 1.6. Mean Days of
On-Demand Use was also 3.1 in the first week and 1.4 in week
24. Daily On-Demand Use also declined steeply initially
followed by a leveling off in the later weeks (1.4 in week 1 and
0.6 week 24).
If the analysis is restricted to only those participants who
continued using FOCUS for 6 months, the declines in Days of
mHealth Use and Days Responding to Prompts do not appear
to be as steep. In this subset, engagement in week 24 remained
high with a mean of 3.8 Days of mHealth Use, 3.5 Days
Responding to Prompts, 1.5 Days of On-Demand Use, and 1.1
Daily On-Demand Use. Both prompted and on-demand features
continued to be used throughout the study (see Figure 2).
Gender, race, age, and number of psychiatric hospitalizations
were all found to be significantly associated with engagement
outcomes (see Table 2). Females were significantly more
engaged as measured by Days of mHealth Use, Days
Responding to Prompts, and Daily On-Demand Use. On average,
females used FOCUS on 0.42 days more per week than males
and responded to prompts on 0.18 days more than males. On
average, females also used on-demand features 1.61 times more
per day than males. No significant association was seen between
gender and Days of On-Demand Use.
White participants were the most engaged. They had
significantly more Days of mHealth Use (0.69 more per week),
Days Responding to Prompts (0.72 more per week), and Days
of 
On-Demand 
Use 
(0.17 
more 
per 
week) 
than
African-American participants. White participants had
significantly more Days Responding to Prompts (0.74 more per
week) and Days of On-Demand Use (0.33 more per week) but
less Daily On-Demand Use (1.32 less uses per day) than
Hispanic participants.
Participants were categorized into three age groups: 18-29,
30-45, and 46-60. Participants aged 30-45 were significantly
more engaged than younger participants (18-29 years) when
considering Days of On-Demand Use (0.42 days more weekly)
and Daily On-Demand Use (0.16 uses more per day). Older
participants (46-60) were significantly more engaged in Days
of On-Demand Use (0.48 days more weekly) and Daily
On-Demand Use (1.78 uses more per day) when compared to
those 18-29. However, they were significantly less engaged in
Days Responding to Prompts (0.41 days fewer).
Participants with 7 or more psychiatric hospitalizations were
significantly less engaged than those with fewer hospitalizations
when considering Days of mHealth Use (0.2 days fewer per
week), but no difference was seen in Days Responding to
Prompts, Days of On-Demand Use, or Daily On-Demand Use.

Discussion
Principal Findings
To our knowledge, this study reports on the largest and longest
implementation of an mHealth program for people with
schizophrenia-spectrum disorders to date and is the first to
systematically examine predictors of mobile phone intervention
engagement among individuals who were recently discharged
from a psychiatric hospitalization [19]. Our findings suggest
that most participants (74%) were willing and able to use the
FOCUS program successfully during this high-risk period for
3-6 months, which refutes the oft-stated concern that people
with schizophrenia who are not clinically stable cannot engage
in mHealth interventions successfully. On average, participants
engaged with the mHealth program every other day. On days
they engaged, they used on-demand (self-initiated) tools more
than once a day.
Individuals’ continued use of the intervention over time was
associated with their level of day-to-day engagement; people
who engaged with the mHealth program more often used it for
more months. This point is worth noting because active users
undoubtedly encountered the same intervention content
repeatedly; it is informative to see that more frequent program
use did not lead to participant disengagement, but the contrary.
Intervention program, patient, or provider characteristics may
have contributed to these results; FOCUS intervention modules
consist of brief skills training, practical exercises, and
encouragement to use illness management techniques.
Participants may have viewed FOCUS as a coaching or
“booster” tool that had continued value even after their initial

 exposure to the content. Participants who were more engaged
may have also had greater capacity to apply FOCUS strategies
in their daily lives and reap the rewards, thus creating a
reinforcing effect that would sustain their engagement. Finally,
HTP case managers were charged with supporting their assigned
participants’ use of the FOCUS intervention. There may have
been some variability in how diligent they were in reviewing
their patients’ mHealth use data via the dashboard and/or how
active they were in encouraging daily and continuous use.
Several demographic and clinical variables were associated with
engagement. Female participants were significantly more
engaged and used the mHealth program on average one half-day
more a week than males. White participants were more engaged
and on average used the mHealth intervention almost one day
more weekly than African-American participants and a third of
a day more than Hispanic participants. Younger participants
(age 18-29) were less engaged than older participants.
Individuals with more severe psychopathology (as indicated by
number of previous psychiatric hospitalizations) were less
engaged than those with less severe psychopathology. Links
between lower engagement in mental health treatment, male
gender, minority background, younger age, and level of
psychopathology have been found in the context of
person-delivered care for people with schizophrenia [20]. Our
data suggest that these patterns may apply to mHealth
interventions as well. Despite having comparatively lower
engagement, most younger participants, most male participants,
most participants from minority backgrounds, and most
participants with seven or more past hospitalizations typically
used the FOCUS program multiple days a week over several
months. While the mHealth intervention approach used in the
study appears to be viable for these subgroups, attempting to
optimize their engagement by developing adapted versions that
can be tailored to subgroup needs may be warranted.
mHealth program functions were associated with engagement.
Participants were exposed to FOCUS intervention content more
often as a result of responding to system-initiated prompts than
after initiating on-demand resources. Both types of intervention
use declined over time (on-demand use had a steeper decline).
This decline in use may be linked with patients feeling more
capable of managing their illness and/or less likely to relapse
(perhaps in part due to internalizing and practicing FOCUS
self-management suggestions). Although mHealth use declined,
the vast majority of individuals used both on-demand and
system-prompted 
functions 
regularly 
throughout 
their
participation, that is, neither function is extraneous. Thus,
enabling both options in mHealth interventions for people with
psychosis is recommended.
Limitations
The study had several limitations. First, participants were
provided with a fully functional mobile phone and data plan,
which limits generalizability. While there was no contingent
reinforcement or monetary incentive to use the FOCUS program,
participants did gain access to other mobile phone resources
(eg, Internet, games, texting) that might have indirectly
influenced their FOCUS use. For example, a participant may
have been more apt to notice and respond to FOCUS prompts
if they took place when already using the phone to listen to
music. We provided study participants with an Android
smartphone to ensure the mHealth program worked reliably;
the FOCUS system is a research tool that was not compatible
with all commercial smartphone operating systems at the time
of the study (eg, iOS, Windows). We also wanted to provide
training, technical support, and troubleshooting solutions that
would apply to all users. In the future, mHealth system that are
compatible with a range of smartphone systems can be deployed,
and clinical technology specialists who are embedded in health
care systems may be able to provide technical and
troubleshooting support to people using a wide array of devices
[21]. Second, while we made every effort to document anomalies
and unexpected events over the course of the study, there were
likely technical (eg, prompting or data transmission failures,
operating system updates that disabled the FOCUS program),
and logistical barriers (eg, staff delays in replacing lost devices,
delays in phones shipping to a study site) that went unidentified
and unrecorded. In circumstances when these events hampered
participants’ ability to use the mHealth intervention or resulted
in unlogged use, engagement may have been underestimated.
Finally, the power to make inferences about specific racial
(especially Hispanic and “other”) or age groups is limited due
to sample size and any relationships examined here should be
confirmed in larger studies.
Conclusions
As interest in mHealth for mental health treatment grows
[22-25], it is important to evaluate which approaches are viable
for different clinical populations (and when) and to gain a better
understanding of the variables that may facilitate or hinder
patient engagement with these novel interventions. This study
provides evidence that individuals with schizophrenia-spectrum
disorders can actively engage with a clinically supported mobile
phone intervention for up to 6 months following hospital
discharge; that gender, race, age, and history of psychiatric
hospitalization were associated with their level of engagement;
and that system-initiated mHealth functions led to proportionally
more exposure to treatment content than on-demand tools, but
that both were used regularly. Taken together, our findings
indicate that the FOCUS mobile phone program may be a useful
method to reach a clinical population that is typically difficult
to engage in clinic-based services during high-risk periods.
Future work should examine whether the use of FOCUS and
other mHealth interventions can lead to clinically meaningful
outcomes such as reduction in relapses.
