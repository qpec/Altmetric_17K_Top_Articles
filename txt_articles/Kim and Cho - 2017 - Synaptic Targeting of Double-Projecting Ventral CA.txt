The acquisition and retrieval of contextual fear memory requires coordinated neural activity in the hippocampus, medial prefrontal
cortex (mPFC), and amygdala. The contextual information encoded in the hippocampus is conveyed to the mPFC and amygdala for
contextual fear conditioning. Previous studies have suggested that a CA1 neuronal population in the ventral hippocampus (VH) projects
to both the mPFC and amygdala and is recruited in context-dependent control of conditioned fear. However, how double-projecting
ventral CA1 hippocampal (vCA1) neurons modulate the activity of the mPFC and amygdala at the synaptic level has not been determined
previously. Here, we show that the optogenetic silencing of the VH prevented the recall of contextual fear memory in mice, indicating its

monosynaptic excitatory responses in both the mPFC and basal amygdala, indicating that they could convey contextual information
through the VH–mPFC and VH–amygdala pathways. The activation of double-projecting vCA1 neurons also induced action potential
firings in the mPFC neurons that project to the amygdala, suggesting that they can also activate the VH–mPFC–amygdala pathway. With
these synaptic mechanisms, double-projecting vCA1 neurons could induce synchronized neural activity in the mPFC and amygdala and
convey contextual information efficiently to the basal amygdala for contextual fear conditioning.

Introduction
In contextual fear conditioning, experimental subjects learn to
associate an environmental context with an aversive uncondi-
tioned stimulus (US; e.g., an electric foot shock), resulting in
conditioned fear responses (e.g., freezing behavior) to the context
(Maren et al., 2013). The acquisition of context–US associative
memory requires two processes in the brain. Contextual repre-
sentations are first encoded in the hippocampus (context encod-
ing) and then associated with the US (context conditioning),
which requires coordinated neural activity in the hippocampus,
medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), and amygdala (Helmstetter
and Bellgowan, 1994; Muller et al., 1997; Corcoran and Quirk,

Significance Statement
This work demonstrates that ventral CA1 hippocampal (vCA1) neurons projecting to both the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC)
and amygdala are activated preferentially when contextual information is processed in the ventral hippocampus, which is re-
quired for contextual fear expression. Our electrophysiological experiments reveal that the activation of double-projecting vCA1
neurons induces excitatory synaptic activity in both the mPFC and amygdala. These results suggest that double-projecting vCA1
neurons could contribute to contextual fear responses by inducing synchronized activity in the mPFC and amygdala and convey-
ing contextual information to the basal amygdala more efficiently than vCA1 neurons projecting to either the mPFC or amygdala
alone. These findings provide important insights into the mechanisms of the acquisition and retrieval of contextual fear memory.

 2007; Goshen et al., 2011; Zhu et al., 2014). Therefore, hippocam-
pal representations of a context are conveyed to the mPFC and
amygdala for the context–US association. However, the synaptic
mechanisms determining how contextual information is relayed
to these areas for contextual fear conditioning have not been
investigated thoroughly.
The hippocampus is characterized by multiple anatomical
and functional domains along its longitudinal axis (Strange et al.,
2014). The ventral hippocampus (VH) projects directly to the
mPFC and amygdala (Jay and Witter, 1991; Kishi et al., 2006),
whereas the dorsal hippocampus (DH) is connected to these
areas indirectly through the entorhinal and perirhinal cortices
(Pitka
¨nen et al., 2000; Tanaka et al., 2014). The role of the DH
neurons in context encoding and contextual fear expression has
been well documented (Goshen et al., 2011; Liu et al., 2012;
Denny et al., 2014). Although it encodes contextual representa-
tions with larger place fields and lower spatial selectivity than the
DH (Jung et al., 1994; Kjelstrup et al., 2008), the VH also plays an
essential role in contextual fear responses by conveying contex-
tual information directly to the mPFC and amygdala. Previous
studies with electrolytic lesions and pharmacological and chemo-
genetic inhibition have suggested that the VH plays a role in
contextual fear conditioning (Maren and Fanselow, 1995; Bast et
al., 2001; Zhang et al., 2001; Trivedi and Coover, 2004; Rudy and
Matus-Amat, 2005; Pentkowski et al., 2006; Zhu et al., 2014;
Zhang et al., 2015). Depending on their projection targets, ventral
CA1 hippocampal (vCA1) neurons play different roles in vari-
ous behavioral tasks, including anxiety-related behavior, goal-
directed behaviors, and social discrimination (Ciocchi et al.,
2015; Okuyama et al., 2016). A recent study by Xu et al. (2016)
also implicates the pathway from the VH to the basal amygdala in
the retrieval of contextual fear memory. Moreover, a population
of vCA1 neurons project to both the mPFC and amygdala with
axon collaterals and are recruited preferentially in context-
dependent fear renewal (Ishikawa and Nakamura, 2006; Jin and
Maren, 2015). It has been suggested that these double-projecting
vCA1 neurons may facilitate synchronized activity in the mPFC
and amygdala, which is implicated in the expression of condi-
tioned fear (Lesting et al., 2011). However, it remains to be de-
termined how these double-projecting vCA1 neurons modulate
neural activity in the mPFC and amygdala for conditioned fear
at the synaptic level.
Using a combined approach of viral tracing, optogenetics,
c-Fos immunohistochemistry, and electrophysiology, we found
that a significant proportion of vCA1 neurons projected to both
the mPFC and amygdala with functional excitatory synapses and
were recruited preferentially during context exposure in mice.
Moreover, the activation of these vCA1 neurons induced excit-
atory postsynaptic responses in the mPFC and basal amygdala
and action potential firings in mPFC neurons projecting to the
basalamygdala.Withthesesynapticmechanisms,double-projecting
vCA1 neurons encoding context representations could induce syn-
chronized neural activity in the mPFC and amygdala and activate
the basal amygdala more efficiently for the acquisition and re-
trieval of contextual fear memory.
Materials and Methods
Subjects. Six- to 8-week-old C57BL/6J mice of either sex (Jackson Labo-
ratory, stock #000664) underwent stereotaxic brain surgery. After sur-
gery, the mice were housed singly in home cages on a 12 h light/dark cycle
with food and water available continuously. All of the animal procedures
were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of
the University of California, Riverside.
Virus constructs. The recombinant adeno-associated viruses (AAV, se-
rotype 5) were packaged by the Vector Core at the University of North
Carolina. The AAV titer was 8.5 � 10 12 genome copies (GCs)/ml for
AAV-CaMKII-channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) (H143R)-eYFP, 6.6 � 10 12
GCs/ml for AAV-double-floxed inverted open reading frame (DIO)-
ChR2(H143R)-eYFP, 4.0 � 10 12 GCs/ml for AAV-CaMKII-eArch3-
eYFP, and 4.3 � 10 12 GCs/ml for AAV-CaMKII-eYFP. Herpes simplex
viruses (HSV) for the retrograde tracing experiments (HSV-pEF1�-
eYFP and HSV-pEF1�-mCherry) were packaged by Dr. Rachael Neve at
the Viral Gene Transfer Core Facility of the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology and the titer was �3.5 � 10 9 infectious units/ml. Canine
adenovirus (CAV2-pCMV-Cre) was obtained from Dr. Eric Kremer at
the Institute of Molecular Genetics of Montpellier and the titer was
5.15 � 10 12 viral particles/ml.
Stereotaxic virus injection and optical cannula implantation. Six- to
8-week-old mice were used for stereotaxic surgery. Before surgery, gen-
eral anesthesia was induced by placing the mice in a transparent anes-
thetic chamber filled with 5% isoflurane. The anesthesia was maintained
during surgery with 1% isoflurane applied to the nostrils of the mice
using a precision vaporizer. Mice were checked for the absence of the
tail-pinch reflex as a sign of sufficient anesthesia. The mice were then
immobilized in a stereotaxic frame with nonrupture ear bars (David
Kopf Instruments) and ophthalmic ointment was applied to prevent eye
drying. After making an incision to the midline of the scalp, small uni-
lateral or bilateral craniotomies were performed using a microdrill with
0.5 mm burrs. The tips of glass capillaries loaded with AAV, HSV, or
CAV2 were placed into specific brain areas using the following stereo-
taxic coordinates: mPFC: 1.7 mm rostral to bregma, 0.4 mm lateral to
midline and 2.5 mm ventral to bregma; basal amygdala (the basolateral
and basomedial nuclei of the amygdala): 1.6 mm caudal to bregma, 3.5
mm lateral to midline, and 4.8 mm ventral to bregma; and the CA1 area
of the VH: 3.4 mm caudal to bregma, 3.7 mm lateral to midline, and 4.0
mm ventral to bregma (Franklin and Paxinos, 2008). A total of 0.15–1.0
�l of virus-containing solution was injected at a rate of 0.1 �l/min using
a 10 �l Hamilton microsyringe and a syringe pump. More specifically,
0.15 �l of AAV-pCaMKII-eYFP or AAV-pCaMKII-ChR2(H143R)-eYFP
was injected into the CA1 area of the DH or VH (see Fig. 1); 1.0 �l of
AAV-pCaMKII-eArch3-eYFP or AAV-pCaMKII-eYFP into the vCA1
(see Fig. 2); 1.0 �l of HSV-pEF1�-eYFP and 1.0 �l of HSV-pEF1�-
mCherry into the mPFC and basal amygdala, respectively (see Figs. 3, 4);
1.0 �l of AAV-DIO-ChR2(H143R)-eYFP into the CA1 area of the VH;
1.0 �l of CAV2-pCMV-Cre into the mPFC or basal amygdala (see Figs. 5,
6); and a mixture of 0.5 �l of HSV-pEF1�-mCherry and 0.5 �l of CAV2-
pCMV-Cre into the basal amygdala (see Fig. 7). After injection, the cap-
illary was left in place for an additional 5 min to allow for diffusion of the
virus solution and then withdrawn. For the optogenetic inhibition exper-
iment (see Fig. 2), bilateral optical cannulae (200 �m in diameter, nu-
meric aperture 0.53; Doric Lenses) were implanted into the CA1 area of
the VH (3.4 mm caudal to bregma, 3.7 mm lateral to midline, and 3.5 mm
ventral to bregma) and secured with dental cement. The scalp incision
was closed with surgical suturing. After surgery, mice were given saline (1
ml, s.c.) containing buprenorphine (0.13 mg/kg body weight) for anal-
gesia and hydration. Behavioral training began 3 weeks after the viral
injection surgery and electrophysiological recording experiments were
performed 4 weeks after surgery.
Contextual fear conditioning and in vivo optogenetic inhibition. For the
optogenetic inhibition experiment (Fig. 2F), mice were habituated with
optical cannulae connected to the optical patch cable without laser stim-
ulation for 10 min once per day for 6 d (day 1 to day 6) in context B
(acrylic plate floor, no illumination, acetic acid odor). On the training
day (day 7), mice were placed in context A (stainless steel grid floor, white
light illumination, benzaldehyde odor) in a standard fear-conditioning
chamber (Med Associates) without optical cannula connection. The
fear-conditioning chamber was illuminated with a white house light
when mice were placed in the context. Mice were given US (0.5 mA
electric foot shock for 2 s with 2 min intervals between the shocks) and
received the first US 3 min after they were placed in the context. On the
test days (days 8–10), mice were placed in context A with optical cannu-
lae connected to the optical patch cable and a green laser. After a 1 min

 acclimatization period, mice were tested for freezing behavior in context
A for 6 min. After the baseline measurement of freezing behavior for 2
min, green light illumination with a green laser (532 nm, 22–25 mW at
the cannula tip; Opto Engine) was applied continuously for 2 min
through optical cannulae to activate eArch3 in the VH. After green light
illumination, mice were left in context A for an additional 2 min. Move-
ment of the mice in the fear-conditioning chamber was recorded using a
near-infrared camera and analyzed in real-time with Ethovision XT 11
software (Noldus). The freezing score was calculated as the percentage of
time that the mice remained immobile. The bout length was 2 s. Each
mouse underwent the freeze test once per day for 3 d (days 8–10) and
freezing scores (2 min bins) in the presence or absence of green light
illumination were calculated separately on each test day and averaged.
Fear conditioning and freeze testing were performed between 9:00 and
11:00 A.M. The temperature in the fear-conditioning chamber was
22–24°C.
For the c-Fos-immunostaining experiment (see Fig. 4B), mice were
randomly assigned to three groups after virus injection surgery. On day 1,
mice in the fear-conditioning group were placed in context A in a fear-
conditioning chamber and given five US (a 0.5 mA electric foot shock for
2 s with 2 min intervals between the US). Mice in the context-only group
were exposed to context A for 12 min without the US. On day 2, mice
from both groups were placed in the same context A and freezing behav-
ior was recorded for 12 min. The freezing score was calculated as the
percentage of time in which the mice remained immobile during the
entire 12 min test session. Ninety minutes after the test session, the brain
tissues from these mice were fixed for c-Fos immunohistochemistry.
Mice in the home cage control group were left in home cages on days 1
and 2.
Histology and microscopic imaging. Acute brain slices (300 �m thick)
were prepared with a vibratome (VT-1000S; Leica) and fixed in 4%
paraformaldehyde-containing PBS (137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 11.9 mM
phosphate, pH 7.4) at 4°C overnight. After fixation, slices were washed 3
times in PBS containing 0.3% Triton X-100 (PBS-T) at room tempera-
ture for 10 min and permeabilized in PBS-T at 4°C overnight. For Nissl
staining, slices were incubated with Neurotrace fluoresent Nissl stain
(1:40 diluted in PBS, 615 nm emission; Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 3 h
at room temperature and washed in PBS-T 3 times for 10 min each time.
After a final wash in PBS-T, Vectashield mounting medium with or
without DAPI (Vector Laboratories) was applied to the slices, which were
then covered with coverslips. Microscopic images were captured using
the Leica TCS SP5 confocal system. Images captured with different fluo-
rescent channels were merged using ImageJ software.
For fluorescent labeling of the recorded neurons (see Figs. 5E, 6E,F),
neurons were loaded with the pipette solution containing 5 mM biocytin
for 20 min. The pipette was then withdrawn slowly and the brain slices
were fixed at 4°C overnight with 4% paraformaldehyde. After fixation,
slices were washed with PBS-T three times for 15 min each time and
incubated with a streptavidin–Alexa Fluor 568 conjugate (20 �g/ml in
PBS, Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 2 h at room temperature. The un-
bound streptavidin was then washed out with PBS three times for 20 min
each and the slices were mounted onto slides. Images of the labeled
neurons were taken using a Leica TSC SP5 confocal microscope and
neuronal morphology and location within the mPFC or basal amygdala
were analyzed.
Quantification of retrogradely labeled vCA1 neurons. Using retrograde
HSV, vCA1 neurons projecting to the mPFC and amygdala were labeled
with eYFP (green) and mCherry (red), respectively. The proportions of
vCA1 neurons projecting to the mPFC and/or amygdala were quantified
based on the florescent labeling of their cell bodies (see Fig. 3). Confocal
microscopic images of the CA1 area of the VH were taken with a 20�
objective lens using the Leica TCS SP5 confocal system and Z-stacked
using ImageJ software. For each mouse, images of 4–6 representative
fields of the ventral CA1 hippocampal area were taken. The proportions
of vCA1 neurons labeled with eYFP only, mCherry only, and eYFP �
mCherry to the total number of all labeled vCA1 neurons were calculated
in each field of the ventral CA1 hippocampal area and averaged for each
mouse. Double-projecting vCA1 neurons were identified based on cell
bodies labeled with both eYFP and mCherry. The proportion of double-
projecting vCA1 neurons to all vCA1 neurons projecting to either the
mPFC or amygdala was also calculated for each mouse.
c-Fos immunohistochemistry and analysis. Ninety minutes after the test
session in context A on day 2 (see Fig. 4B), brain slices (100 �m thick)
were prepared with a vibratome and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde-
containing PBS at 4°C for 30 min. After fixation, the slices were perme-
abilized in PBS-T at 4°C for 4 d. Brain sections were then blocked with
PBS containing 5% goat serum at 4°C for 1 h. The slices were washed with
PBS-T for 10 min and incubated with a rabbit anti-c-Fos antibody (1:500
in PBS-T, sc-52; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 4°C overnight. The slices
were then washed with PBS-T three times for 10 min each time and
incubated with goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody–Alexa Fluor 405 (1:200 in
PBS-T, A-31556; Thermo Fisher Scientific) at 4°C overnight. The slices
were then washed three times with PBS-T for 10 min each time and
mounted onto glass slides for confocal microscopic imaging. For each
mouse, Z-series confocal microscopic images of 4–6 representative fields
(0.6 mm 2 area, 45 �m thick) of the CA1 area of the VH and Z-stacked the
images were captured using ImageJ software. vCA1 neurons projecting to
either the mPFC (labeled with eYFP only) or amygdala alone (labeled
with mCherry only), as well as double-projecting vCA1 neurons (labeled
with both eYFP and mCherry), were identified. Then, the proportions of
c-Fos� neurons (blue fluorescence) among all vCA1 neurons projecting
to either the mPFC or amygdala alone or all double-projecting vCA1
neurons in each vCA1 field were calculated and the proportions averaged
for each mouse.
Electrophysiology and photostimulation in brain slices. Four weeks after
surgery, the mice were deeply anesthetized with 5% isoflurane and de-
capitated. Brains were dissected quickly and chilled in ice-cold artificial
CSF (ACSF) containing the following (in mM): 130 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 2.5
CaCl2, 1 MgSO4, 1.25 NaH2PO4, 26 NaHCO3, and 10 glucose with 95%
O2 and 5% CO2. Coronal brain slices containing the mPFC, amygdala, or
VH (300 �m thick) were prepared with a vibratome. After a 1 h recovery
period, slices were placed in the recording chamber and perfused contin-
uously with the ACSF at the rate of 1 ml/min. For most of the whole-cell
recordings, the patch electrodes (2–3 M� resistance) were filled with
pipette solution containing the following (in mM): 140 Cs-methanesulfonate,
5 NaCl, 1 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, 0.2 EGTA, 2 MgATP, 0.5 NaGTP, and 5 QX
314 chloride (290 mOsm, adjusted to pH 7.3 with CsOH). Whole-cell
patch-clamp recordings were performed at 30–32°C using a Multiclamp
700B amplifier, a Digidata 1550A digitizer, and Clampex 10 software
(Molecular Devices). The membrane potential was held constant at �80
mV in voltage-clamp mode unless otherwise indicated. The liquid junc-
tion potential of 8.9 mV was corrected. Series (access) resistance was
�20 M� and was not compensated. Offline data analysis was per-
formed using the Clampfit 10 program (Molecular Devices).
A blue collimated light-emitting diode (LED) with a peak wavelength
of 470 nm (M470L3; Thorlabs) was used for photostimulation of ChR2-
expressing axons (Cho et al., 2013). The LED was connected to the am-
plifier and digitizer through the LED driver (LEDD1B; Thorlabs). Brain
slices in the recording chamber were illuminated through a 40� water-
immersion objective lens (LUMPLFLN 40XW; Olympus) and a 450–490
nm filter (Chroma). The illumination area was 0.17 mm 2 and was cen-
tered at the soma of the neuron patched for recording. To evoke synaptic
responses in the mPFC or amygdala by photostimulation of VH axons,
slices were illuminated every 20 s with blue light pulses of 1 ms (light
power density: 6–20 mW/mm 2).
To stimulate the axon collaterals of double-projecting vCA1 neurons
selectively and induce postsynaptic responses in the amygdala, canine
adenovirus-2 (CAV-2) encoding Cre recombinase gene was injected into
the mPFC and AAV-DIO-ChR2-eYFP into the VH (see Fig. 5A). In this
experimental setup, CAV-2 is taken up by axon terminals in the mPFC
and transported retrogradely to brain areas including the VH (Hnasko et
al., 2006). Cre expression in mPFC-projecting vCA1 neurons then in-
duces the recombination of a DIO, resulting in ChR2-eYFP expression
(Atasoy et al., 2008). Because mPFC-projecting vCA1 neurons express
ChR2, blue light illumination applied locally to the amygdala activated
presynaptic axons of double-projecting VH neurons selectively, inducing
EPSCs in BLA/BMA neurons. We used the same approach to stimulate

Kim and Cho • Double-Projecting Ventral CA1 Hippocampal Neurons
 selectively the axon collaterals of double-projecting vCA1 neurons in the
mPFC (see Figs. 6A, 7A).
For the optogenetic inhibition experiment in brain slices (see Fig.
2C–E), 140 mM Cs-methanesulfonate in the pipette solution was replaced
with 150 mM K-gluconate without QX 314 added and the liquid junction
potential of 15.5 mV was corrected. A green LED with a peak wavelength
of 565 nm (M565L3; Thorlabs) and a 540–580 nm filter (Chroma) was
used to activate eArch3 (light power density: 10 mW/mm 2).
Reagents were prepared as stock solutions in water at 1000-fold con-
centrations and stored at �20°C. The reagents were purchased from
Tocris Bioscience (NBQX, D-AP5, QX 314, and biocytin) or Sigma-
Aldrich (ATP, GTP, and bicuculline methochloride).
Data analysis. Data are presented as means � SEM. For statistical
comparisons, Student’s t test was used for paired samples (paired t test),
Welch’s t test for independent samples (unpaired t test), and ordinary or
repeated-measures ANOVA. For post hoc analysis, we used Bonferroni’s si-
multaneous multiple comparisons. Statistical analysis was performed with
Minitab 17 software (Minitab), and p � 0.05 was considered statistically
significant.
Results
VH projects directly to the mPFC and basal amygdala
To investigate how the hippocampus projects to the mPFC and
amygdala, we transduced CA1 neurons of the DH and VH in
mice with an AAV vector coding eYFP gene under the control of
the CaMKII promoter (AAV-pCaMKII-eYFP, Fig. 1A,B). Four
weekslater,eYFPexpressioninhippocampalneuronswasidentified
with green fluorescence. The axonal fibers of eYFP-expressing hip-
pocampal neurons were also identified with green fluorescence in
coronal brain sections of the mPFC and amygdala. When AAV
was injected into the DH, we observed only weak eYFP-labeled
projections in the mPFC and amygdala (Fig. 1A). However, when
AAV was injected into the VH, abundant eYFP-labeled projec-
tions were detected in the mPFC and amygdala (Fig. 1B). In the
mPFC, these projections were detected in both the prelimbic (PL)
and infralimbic (IL) divisions of the mPFC. Within the amygdala,
projections from the VH were found predominantly in the baso-
lateral and basomedial nuclei of the amygdala (BLA/BMA).
These results suggest that the mPFC and basal amygdala receive
strong monosynaptic inputs from the VH but only weak projec-
tions from the DH.
To determine whether VH projections make functional syn-
aptic contacts onto neurons in the mPFC and amygdala, we
injected AAV coding ChR2 (H143R)–eYFP fusion gene under
the control of the CaMKII promoter (AAV-pCaMKII-ChR2-
eYFP) (Boyden et al., 2005). Four weeks later, we examined the
photostimulation-induced synaptic responses in these areas (Fig.
1C–H). In the mPFC, short pulses of blue light illumination (1
ms duration) evoked robust EPSCs at �80 mV in voltage-clamp
mode (n � 6 cells; Fig. 1C–E). EPSCs were also induced in the
amygdala by photostimulation of VH projections expressing
ChR2 (Fig. 1F,G), as reported previously (Hu
¨bner et al., 2014).
Consistent with the projection pattern of the VH (Fig. 1B), the
amplitude of the EPSCs was significantly larger in the basal
amygdala (BLA/BMA) than in other nuclei of the amygdala [Fig.
1H; main effect of subnuclei of the amygdala, F(3,29) � 8.75, p �
0.001, repeated-measures one-way ANOVA; p � 0.05, BLA/BMA
vs lateral nucleus of the amygdala (LA), intercalated cells, or cen-
tral nucleus of the amygdala (CeA), post hoc Bonferroni’s simul-
taneous multiple comparisons; n � 5–16 cells per subnucleus].
These results indicate that the VH neurons make excitatory syn-
aptic connections onto neurons in the mPFC and basal amygdala.
Optogenetic inhibition of the VH prevents the recall of

al., 1997; Corcoran and Quirk, 2007; Goshen et al., 2011; Zhu et al.,
2014). Therefore, we examined the role of the VH in the expression of

(AAV-eArch3) into the VH bilaterally (Chow et al., 2010; Mattis et al.,
2011)andimplantedbilateralopticalcannulaeintotheCA1areaofthe
VH (Fig. 2A,B). eArch3 was expressed in vCA1 pyramidal neurons
under the control of the CaMKII promoter. In eYFP control group,
we injected AAV encoding the eYFP gene (AAV-eYFP) and im-
plantedopticalcannulaebilaterallyintothevCA1area.Inbrainslices
from mice in the eArch3 group, green light illumination induced
robust outward currents in voltage-clamp mode in vCA1 neu-
rons expressing eArch3 (Fig. 2C). In current-clamp mode, the
green light illumination induced eArch3-mediated hyperpolar-
ization, which inhibited action potential firings in vCA1 neurons
with high temporal precision (n � 5 cells; Fig. 2D,E). These
results indicate that VH activity can be silenced in vivo using our
optogenetic approach. Such effects were not observed in vCA1
neurons in the eYFP control group.
To investigate the role of the VH in conditioned fear expression,
weexaminedhowacutesilencingofVHactivityaffectedtherecallof
fear memory after contextual fear conditioning. After being habitu-
ated to handling and optical cable connection for 6 d (days 1–6),
mice in both the eArch3 and eYFP groups were fear conditioned in
context A on the training day (day 7) by receiving the US (electric
foot shocks, 0.5 mA, 2 s duration; Fig. 2F). After contextual fear
conditioning,miceweretestedforconditionedfearresponses(freez-
ing behavior) in context A once per day for 3 successive days (days
8–10). On the test days, freezing behavior was monitored in context
A. During the first 2 min of the behavioral testing, mice in both the
eArch3 and eYFP groups displayed robust freezing behavior in con-
text A (Fig. 2G). After the baseline measurement of freezing behav-
ior, illumination with a green laser was applied to the VH through
theopticalcannulaefor2mininbothgroups,followedbybehavioral
monitoringwithoutilluminationforanadditional2min.Thefreez-
ing score was calculated for each 2 min session. Repeated-measures
two-way ANOVA revealed a significant interaction between laser
(on vs off) and group (eArch3 vs eYFP) (F(1,10) � 6.67, p � 0.05).
Post hoc comparisons revealed that the freezing behavior in the
eArch3 group was significantly reduced by green laser illumination
(Fig. 2G,H; p � 0.01, laser on vs laser off, Bonferroni’s simultaneous
multiple comparisons; n � 5 mice), whereas the same green laser
illumination did not affect freezing behavior in the eYFP control
group (Fig. 2G,H; p � 0.49; n � 7 mice), indicating that the effect
of green laser illumination on freezing behavior was dependent
upon eArch3 expression in the VH. These results suggest that VH
activity is necessary for the recall of contextual fear memory.
Some ventral CA1 hippocampal neurons project to both the
mPFC and amygdala with axon collaterals
The VH may contribute to the recall of contextual fear memory by
conveying context representations to the mPFC and amygdala.
Therefore, we determined the proportions of VH neurons project-
ing to either the mPFC or amygdala using dual retrograde viral trac-
ing with HSV, which is taken up by axon terminals and transported

 to the soma. We injected HSV coding eYFP
(HSV-eYFP) into the mPFC and HSV cod-
ing mCherry gene (HSV-mCherry) into the
basalamygdala,whichincludestheBLAand
BMA (Fig. 3A). The cell bodies of VH neu-
rons projecting to the mPFC and amygdala
were labeled with eYFP and mCherry, re-
spectively. Consistent with the results of our
anterograde viral tracing experiments (Fig.
1A,B),neuronsprojectingtothemPFCand
amygdala were found in the VH, but were
not detected in the DH (Fig. 3B,C). VH
neurons projecting to the mPFC and
amygdala were found in the CA1 area and
subiculum of the VH (Fig. 3B), which was
consistent with previous reports (Ishikawa
andNakamura,2006;JinandMaren,2015).
Most of the labeled vCA1 neurons expressed
eithereYFPormCherryalone,indicatingthat
they project to either the mPFC or amygdala
alone (mPFC projectors: 43.7 � 2.6% of all
labeled vCA1 neurons; amygdala projectors:
47.3�2.6%;mean�SEM;n�22mice;Fig.
3D). Surprisingly, 9.0 � 0.6% of all labeled
vCA1 neurons were both eYFP and mCherry
positive(Fig.3B,D),suggestingthattheyproj-
ect to both the mPFC and amygdala. We also
found that 18.0 � 1.5% of mPFC-projecting
vCA1 neurons also projected to the amygdala
and 16.6 � 1.2% of amygdala-projecting
vCA1 neurons also projected to the mPFC
with axon collaterals (mean � SEM, n � 22
mice; Fig. 3E–G). These results suggest that a
significant proportion of vCA1 neurons have
long-rangeprojectionstoboththemPFCand
basal amygdala.
Double-projecting vCA1 neurons are
activated preferentially during context
encoding and the recall of contextual
fear memory
We next examined the role of vCA1 neu-
rons projecting to the mPFC and/or
amygdala in context encoding and con-
textual

expression
using
c-Fos
immunohistochemistry combined with
retrograde tracing. We injected HSV-
eYFP and HSV-mCherry into the mPFC
and amygdala, respectively, to label vCA1
neurons projecting to these areas (Fig.
4A). After surgery, mice in the fear-
conditioning group received electric foot
shocks (0.5 mA, 120 s interval) in a novel

 context exposure on the test day, brain tissues from these mice
were fixed for c-Fos immunohistochemistry. Mice in the home
cage control group were left in home cages until brain fixation. As
in the previous experiments, we identified vCA1 neurons project-
ing to the mPFC and amygdala with eYFP and mCherry fluores-
cence (Fig. 4D,E). There were no significant differences in the
proportions of vCA1 neurons labeled with eYFP and/or mCherry
between the behavioral groups (main effect of behavioral group:
F(2,30) � 0.29, p � 0.75; main effect of eYFP/mCherry labeling:
F(2,30) � 59.29, p � 0.001; group � labeling interaction: F(4,30) �
1.36, p � 0.27; repeated-measures two-way ANOVA; n � 6 mice
per group), suggesting that the proportions of vCA1 neurons
projecting to the mPFC and/or amygdala were not different be-
tween the behavioral groups.
We next compared the proportion of c-Fos expression in
vCA1 neurons of different projection types between the behav-
ioral groups. A repeated-measures two-way ANOVA with factors
of projection type (mPFC-projecting, amygdala-projecting, or
double-projecting) and group (home cage group, context-only
group, or fear-conditioning group) revealed a significant group �
projection type interaction (F(4,30) � 3.03, p � 0.05; n � 6 mice
per group; Fig. 4F). The c-Fos expression pattern of vCA1 neurons
did not differ between the context-only and fear-conditioning
groups (main effect of behavioral group: F(1,20) � 0.00, p � 0.96;

 main effect of projection type: F(2,20) � 15.23, p � 0.001; group �
projection type interaction: F(2,20) � 0.42, p � 0.66; Fig. 4F).
Therefore, we collapsed these groups to simplify the analysis and
performed a repeated-measures two-way ANOVA, which also re-
vealed a significant group � projection type interaction (F(2,32) �
5.92, p � 0.01). Post hoc analysis indicated that a greater propor-
tion of double-projecting vCA1 neurons expressed c-Fos com-
pared with the single-projecting vCA1 neurons when the mice
were exposed to the context or recalled contextual fear memory
(p � 0.01, Bonferroni’s simultaneous multiple comparisons; Fig.
4F). However, there was no difference in c-Fos-positive propor-
tion between single- and double-projecting vCA1 neurons in the
home cage group (p � 1.00; Fig. 4F). These results suggest that
double-projecting vCA1 neurons are activated preferentially dur-
ing context exposure and the recall of contextual fear memory
rather than vCA1 neurons projecting to either the mPFC or
amygdala alone.
Double-projecting vCA1 neurons make excitatory synapses
onto principal neurons in the basal amygdala
Our results suggest that double-projecting vCA1 neurons may
contribute to the encoding of context representations, which are
conveyed to the mPFC and amygdala for contextual fear re-
sponses. Therefore, we investigated whether the projections of
these vCA1 neurons formed synaptic contacts onto neurons in
the amygdala and mPFC. To this end, we developed an optoge-
netic approach to stimulate selectively the axon collaterals of
double-projecting vCA1 neurons to induce postsynaptic re-
sponses in the amygdala or mPFC (Figs. 5, 6). We first injected
CAV-2 encoding the Cre recombinase gene into the mPFC. We
also injected AAV-DIO-ChR2-eYFP into the CA1 area of the VH
(Fig. 5A). In this experimental setup, CAV-2 is taken up by axons
terminals in the mPFC and transported retrogradely to brain
areas including the VH (Hnasko et al., 2006). Cre expression in
mPFC-projecting vCA1 neurons then induces the recombination
of a DIO, resulting in ChR2-eYFP expression (Atasoy et al.,
2008). We identified the mPFC-projecting vCA1 neurons with
eYFP expression (Fig. 5B) and observed eYFP-labeled axons of
vCA1 neurons within the mPFC (Fig. 5C). eYFP-labeled axons
were also detected in the amygdala, predominantly in the basal
amygdala (BLA/BMA), where neither CAV-2 nor AAV was in-
jected (Fig. 5D). This finding suggests that they originated from
vCA1 neurons projecting to both the mPFC and amygdala, which
is consistent with the results of our retrograde viral tracing exper-
iments (Fig. 3).
We next performed whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in
principal neurons of the basal amygdala (BLA/BMA) in brain
slices from these mice (Fig. 5E). Because mPFC-projecting vCA1

 neurons express ChR2, blue light illumination applied locally to
the amygdala activated presynaptic axons of double-projecting
VH neurons selectively, inducing EPSCs in BLA/BMA neurons at
�80 mV in voltage-clamp mode (Fig. 5F). These EPSCs were
inhibited completely by the application of AMPA- and NMDA-
type glutamate receptor antagonists (NBQX � D-AP5; t(6) �
5.96, p � 0.01, paired t test; n � 7 cells; Fig. 5F), indicating that
the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate mediated the EPSCs.
We also investigated whether double-projecting vCA1 neurons
activated local inhibitory interneurons and induced feedforward
inhibition in principal neurons of the BLA/BMA. At 0 mV in
voltage-clamp mode, photostimulation of the axon collaterals of
double-projecting vCA1 neurons induced IPSCs in principal
neurons of the BLA/BMA (Fig. 5G). The synaptic delay of the
IPSC was significantly longer compared with the monosynaptic
EPSC recorded at �80 mV, revealing their disynaptic nature
(t(11) � 7.01, p � 0.001, paired t test, n � 12 cells; Fig. 5G). The
IPSCs were mediated by the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA
because they were inhibited by bicuculline, a GABAA receptor
antagonist (t(5) � 2.74, p � 0.05, paired t test; n � 6 cells; Fig.
5H). The IPSCs were also blocked by glutamate receptor inhibi-
tors (NBQX � D-AP5), confirming the disynaptic feedforward
inhibition (t(5) � 4.34, p � 0.01, paired t test; n � 6 cells; Fig. 5I).
Together,theseresultssuggestthatdouble-projectingvCA1neurons
make functional synapses onto the basal amygdala, inducing both
monosynaptic excitatory and feedforward inhibitory responses.
We also estimated the proportion of presynaptic inputs from
double-projecting vCA1 neurons to overall inputs from vCA1
neurons projecting to the basal amygdala. To this end, we injected
CAV2-Cre and AAV-DIO-ChR2-eYFP into the basal amygdala and
VH, respectively (Fig. 5J). Under these conditions, local blue light
illumination applied to the basal amygdala activated ChR2-
expressing presynaptic axons of vCA1 neurons projecting to the
basal amygdala alone (single-projecting neurons), as well as
double-projecting vCA1 neurons. In the basal amygdala, EPSCs
induced by optogenetic stimulation of both single- and double-
projecting vCA1 neurons (Fig. 5K) were larger than EPSCs in-
duced by activation of double-projecting vCA1 neurons alone in
previous experiments (t(29) � 6.29, p � 0.001, unpaired t test; n �
23 cells for single/double-projecting vCA1 axons and n � 24 cells
for double-projecting vCA1 axons; Fig. 5L). The average peak
amplitude of EPSCs induced by stimulation of double-projecting
vCA1 neurons was 23.0% of the average amplitude of EPSCs
evoked by activation of both single- and double-projecting vCA1
neurons, which was close to the proportion of double-projecting
neurons to overall vCA1 neurons projecting to the amygdala
from our retrograde tracing experiments (16.6%; Fig. 3F,G).
Double-projecting vCA1 neurons make excitatory synapses
onto mPFC neurons
We next investigated whether double-projecting vCA1 neurons
also form functional synapses with mPFC neurons. We induced
the expression of ChR2-eYFP selectively in amygdala-projecting
CA1 hippocampal neurons by injecting CAV2-Cre into the basal
amygdala and AAV-DIO-ChR2-eYFP into the VH (Fig. 6A). The
amygdala-projecting CA1 neurons were identified in the VH with
eYFP fluorescence (Fig. 6B). In the amygdala, we observed eYFP-
labeled axons of amygdala-projecting vCA1 neurons (Fig. 6C).
eYFP-labeled axons were also detected in the mPFC (Fig. 6D),
indicating that these axons originated from vCA1 hippocampal
neurons projecting to both the amygdala and mPFC. These axon
collaterals were found in both the PL and IL divisions of the
mPFC. In the PL, axons of double-projecting vCA1 neurons were
found predominantly in layers 2–3, whereas they were detected in
both layers 2–3 and layers 5–6 in the IL (Fig. 6E,F). Local blue
light illumination of these ChR2-expressing axons induced
EPSCs in mPFC neurons at �80 mV in voltage-clamp mode (Fig.
6G). The peak amplitude of EPSC was proportional to the pho-
tostimulation intensity (Fig. 6G,H). The average amplitude of
EPSCs was significantly larger in the PL neurons than in IL neu-
rons (Fig. 6H; main effect of mPFC area, IL/PL: F(1,57) � 5.28, p �
0.05; main effect of photostimulation intensity: F(3,57) � 51.61,
p � 0.001; mPFC area � photostimulation intensity: F(3,57) � 1.33,
p � 0.27; repeated-measures two-way ANOVA. n � 10–11 neu-
rons for PL and IL), suggesting that the PL receives more presyn-
aptic inputs from the double-projecting vCA1 neurons than the
IL. As in the basal amygdala, optogenetic stimulation of the axon
collaterals of double-projecting vCA1 neurons induced IPSCs at
0 mV in the mPFC neurons with a more delayed onset than the
EPSCs, indicating disynaptic feedforward inhibition (Fig. 6I).
There was no significant difference in the IPSC amplitude or the
EPSC/IPSC ratio between the PL and IL (IPSC: t(13) � 0.07, p �
0.95; EPSC/IPSC ratio: t(12) � 0.83, p � 0.42; unpaired t test; n �
8–11 cells for PL and IL; Figure 6I–L). Together, these results
suggest that double-projecting vCA1 neurons make excitatory
synapses onto mPFC neurons.
Activation of double-projecting vCA1 neurons induces action
potential firings in amygdala-projecting mPFC neurons
Our results suggest that double-projecting vCA1 neurons are ac-
tivated preferentially during context exposure (Fig. 4) and acti-
vate both the mPFC and amygdala simultaneously through axon
collaterals (Figs. 5, 6). If mPFC neurons activated by these axon
collaterals are connected to BLA/BMA neuronsthroughexcitatory
synapses, then double-projecting vCA1 neurons could activate VH–
mPFC–BLA/BMA pathway. We tested this possibility by investi-
gating whetheroptogeneticstimulationofdouble-projectingvCA1
neurons could activate mPFC neurons projecting to the basal
amygdala. To this end, we injected CAV2-Cre into the basal
amygdala (BLA/BMA) and AAV-DIO-ChR2-eYFP into the vCA1

 area to induce ChR2-eYFP expression in
BLA/BMA-projecting vCA1 neurons (Fig.
7A). We also injected the retrograde tracer
HSV-mCherry into the basal amygdala to
label BLA/BMA-projecting mPFC neu-
rons with mCherry. In brain slices of the
mPFC, BLA/BMA-projecting mPFC neu-
rons were identified withmCherry,andthe
axon collaterals of double-projecting vCA1
neurons were identified with eYFP (Fig.
7B). Local blue light illumination of the
mPFC induced EPSCs in BLA/BMA-pro-
jecting mPFC neurons (n � 10 cells; Fig.
7C,D). Moreover, optogenetic stimulation
of the projections of double-projecting
vCA1 neurons induced action potential fir-
ings in 5 of 8 BLA/BMA-projecting mPFC
neurons examined (Fig. 7E,F), indicating
that double-projecting vCA1 neurons can ac-
tivateBLA/BMA-projectingmPFC neurons.
Because the mPFC projects to the basal
amygdala (BLA/BMA) with glutamatergic
excitatory synapses (Cho et al., 2013), our
results suggest that double-projecting
vCA1 neurons can activate the VH–mPFC–
amygdala pathway. By activating both the
direct VH–amygdala pathway and the indi-
rect VH–mPFC–amygdala pathway, double-
projecting vCA1 neurons could induce
more robust excitatory synaptic responses
in the basal amygdala through temporal
summation than vCA1 neurons project-
ing only to the amygdala. These synaptic
mechanisms
could
enable
double-
projecting vCA1 neurons to convey con-
textual information more efficiently to
the basal amygdala for the expression of
contextual fear memory (see model in Fig.
8).
Discussion
Our results demonstrate the synaptic mecha-
nisms of how double-projecting vCA1 neu-
rons modulate the activity of the mPFC
and basal amygdala. Our viral tracing and
electrophysiological studies revealed that
the VH projects directly to the mPFC and
amygdala with excitatory synapses. Opto-
genetic silencing of the vCA1 inhibited the
recall of contextual fear memory in mice,
suggesting that VH activity is required for
contextual fear responses. In retrograde
tracing experiments, a proportion of
vCA1 neurons projected to both the
mPFC and amygdala. Moreover, com-
pared with the vCA1 neurons projecting
to either the mPFC or amygdala alone, a greater proportion of
double-projectingvCA1neuronswere recruited during context ex-
posure, indicating their role in encoding context representations.
At the synaptic level, optogenetic stimulation of double-projecting
vCA1 neurons induced monosynaptic excitatory and feedfor-
ward inhibitory responses in the mPFC and amygdala, indicating

 that they could convey contextual infor-
mation to these brain areas simultane-
ously through the VH–mPFC and VH–
amygdala pathways. Furthermore,
the
activation of double-projecting vCA1
neurons was sufficient to induce AP fir-
ings in mPFC neurons projecting to the
basal amygdala, suggesting their role in
activating the VH–mPFC–amygdala cir-
cuit. With these synaptic mechanisms,
double-projecting vCA1 neurons could in-
duce synchronized neural activity in the
mPFC and amygdala and convey contex-
tual information efficiently to the basal
amygdala through both the direct VH–
amygdala pathway and the indirect
VH–mPFC–amygdala pathway. By mod-
ulating the activity of the mPFC and basal
amygdala, double-projecting vCA1 neu-
rons are likely to contribute to the acqui-
sition and retrieval of contextual fear
memory (Fig. 8B).
Previous studies have suggested that a
proportion of vCA1 neurons project to
both the mPFC and amygdala (Ishikawa
and Nakamura, 2006; Jin and Maren,
2015). Consistently, electrical and opto-
genetic stimulation of the mPFC and
amygdala has been shown to evoke an-
tidromic responses in the same vCA1
neurons (Ishikawa and Nakamura, 2006; Ciocchi et al., 2015).
However, the antidromic responses may also have been induced
by activation of the axon fibers of passage and do not represent
faithfully the functional synaptic connections. Moreover, the ex-
tent of collateralization of vCA1 neural populations projecting to
the mPFC and amygdala was not estimated in these studies. Using
dual retrograde viral tracing, we found that 18.0 � 1.5% of
mPFC-projecting vCA1 neurons also projected to the amygdala
and that 16.6 � 1.2% of amygdala-projecting vCA1 neurons also
projected to the mPFC. With electrophysiological recordings,
we also demonstrated that optogenetic stimulation of the axon
collaterals of double-projecting vCA1 neurons induced mono-
synaptic excitatory and feedforward inhibitory responses in the
mPFC and amygdala, indicating the presence of functional excit-
atory synaptic connections from double-projecting vCA1 neu-
rons to the mPFC and amygdala.
Prior studies have indicated that pharmacological inhibition
and electrolytic lesion of the VH suppress contextual fear expres-
sion (Trivedi and Coover, 2004; Pentkowski et al., 2006; Zhang et
al., 2015). However, such manipulations of hippocampal function
could affect other neuronal processes nonspecifically and do not
allow for cellular and temporal precision. To achieve acute and
reversible silencing of VH activity with a high degree of temporal
precision, we used an in vivo optogenetic approach and found
that contextual fear expression was suppressed by optogenetic
silencing of the VH, which suggests a role for the VH in the
retrieval of contextual fear memory, although silencing of VH
activity may have also affected the ability of the subjects to time
the expected shock (Balsam et al., 2010; Eichenbaum, 2014). This
finding is consistent with a recent study implicating the VH–
basal
amygdala
pathway
in
contextual
fear
expression
(Xu et al., 2016). Moreover, c-Fos immunohistochemistry re-
vealed that double-projecting vCA1 neurons were activated to a
greater extent during context exposure and the recall of contex-
tual fear memory than vCA1 neurons projecting to either the
mPFC or amygdala alone, suggesting that they play a role in
context encoding during contextual fear responses. How, then,
do double-projecting vCA1 neurons contribute to the retrieval of
contextual fear memory? During the recall of contextual fear
memory, the hippocampal representation of a context is con-
veyed to the mPFC and amygdala, which are essential areas for
contextual fear responses (Helmstetter and Bellgowan, 1994;
Muller et al., 1997; Corcoran and Quirk, 2007; Goshen et al.,
2011; Zhu et al., 2014; Adhikari et al., 2015). Double-projecting
vCA1 neurons encoding contextual information can activate
the mPFC and amygdala simultaneously through their axon
collaterals and induce synchronized neural activity in these
areas. Because synchronized activity between the mPFC and
amygdala has been implicated in conditioned fear responses
(Lesting et al., 2011), double-projecting vCA1 neurons could
contribute to the recall of contextual fear memory by facilitat-
ing synchronized activity between these areas. Moreover, our
results also indicate that activation of double-projecting vCA1
neurons induced larger excitatory postsynaptic responses in
the PL/mPFC than in the IL/mPFC. Previous studies have
suggested that the PL/mPFC and IL/mPFC may play different
roles in the modulation of contextual fear responses because
the expression of contextual fear memory was suppressed by
pharmacological inhibition of the PL/mPFC, as well as optoge-
netic activation of the IL/mPFC projecting to the amygdala (Cor-
coran and Quirk, 2007; Adhikari et al., 2015). Therefore, double-
projecting vCA1 neurons could facilitate contextual fear
responses by activating the PL/mPFC more robustly than the
IL/mPFC.

Kim and Cho • Double-Projecting Ventral CA1 Hippocampal Neurons
 Previous studies with electrolytic lesions and pharmacological
and chemogenetic inhibition have suggested that the VH is also
required for the acquisition and consolidation of contextual fear
memory (Maren and Fanselow, 1995; Bast et al., 2001; Zhang et
al., 2001; Rudy and Matus-Amat, 2005; Zhu et al., 2014). Double-
projecting vCA1 neurons could also contribute to these processes
by conveying contextual information efficiently to the amygdala
for the context–US association. The acquisition of contextual fear
memory requires coordinated neural activity in the hippocampus
and amygdala (Ohkawa et al., 2015) and the memory of the con-
text–US association is thought to be encoded in the pathway from
the hippocampus to the amygdala (Maren and Fanselow, 1995).
Contextual representations in the DH could be conveyed to the
amygdala indirectly though the entorhinal and perirhinal corti-
ces for the formation of contextual fear memory (Tanaka et al.,
2014). Alternatively, vCA1 hippocampal neurons can also convey
contextual information directly to the amygdala through their
excitatory
projections for contextual fear memory formation. The results of
our electrophysiological study suggest that double-projecting
vCA1 neurons can activate both the direct VH–amygdala
pathway and the indirect VH–mPFC–amygdala pathway. By
activating direct and indirect pathways to the amygdala, they
can induce successive postsynaptic responses in the basal
amygdala with short time intervals, resulting in efficient temporal
summation (Fig. 8B). The coactivation of convergent inputs with
short time intervals induces input timing-dependent synaptic
plasticity (ITDP) in the amygdala, a type of long-term potentia-
tion that has been implicated in the formation of conditioned fear
memory (Cho et al., 2011). Therefore, double-projecting vCA1
neurons conveying contextual information could facilitate ITDP
induction in the basal amygdala and contribute to the encoding
of context–US associative memory in the VH to the amygdala
pathway.
One of the limitations of our dual retrograde tracing study is
that only the mPFC and amygdala were examined as projection
targets of the VH. Therefore, labeled vCA1 neurons were classi-
fied as neurons projecting to either the mPFC or amygdala alone
or neurons projecting to both the mPFC and amygdala. These
vCA1 neurons may also have long-range projections to other
brain areas including the nucleus accumbens (NAc). We ob-
served that a population of mPFC- or amygdala-projecting VH
neurons also have axon collaterals projecting to the NAc (J.-H.C.,
unpublished data). Therefore, vCA1 neurons identified in our
study could have been further assigned into subgroups if the NAc
had also been included in their projection target area and vCA1
neurons of each subgroup may play different roles in behavioral
tasks and emotional states. In support of this, a recent study has
suggested that vCA1 neurons with triple projections to the
mPFC, amygdala, and NAc show more prominent firing during
behavioral tasks and sharp wave/ripples than vCA1 neurons with
single or double projections to these areas (Ciocchi et al., 2015).
Moreover, vCA1 neurons projecting to the NAc have been impli-
cated in goal-directed behavior and social memory in rodents
(Ciocchi et al., 2015; Okuyama et al., 2016).
In addition to the VH, long-range axon collaterals were also
found in other brain areas. For example, principal neurons in the
BLA project to multiple downstream targets including the NAc,
CeA, and VH with 17–33% collateralization in mice (Beyeler et
al., 2016). Therefore, long-range axon collaterals to multiple
brain areas may be a general feature of the neural circuits in the
brain and could promote synchronized neural activity and long-
term synaptic plasticity in different brain areas. The experimental
approaches used in our current study enable the selective
stimulation of axon collaterals and detailed electrophysiolog-
ical analyses of synaptic responses, which can be used to deter-
mine synaptic connections of other brain areas projecting to
multiple targets with long-range axon collaterals. Our results also
have implications for optogenetic and chemogenetic approaches
to control the activity of a neural circuit, in which opsins or
designer receptors are expressed in a population of neurons
projecting to a specific brain area. Therefore, long-range collat-
eralization to multiple brain areas should be considered when
designing experiments using these approaches and interpreting
the experimental results.
