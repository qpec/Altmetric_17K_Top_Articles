SUMMARY  
Both the lateral and the central nuclei of the amygdala are required for adaptive behavioral 
responses to environmental cues predicting threats. While experience-driven synaptic plasticity 
in the lateral amygdala is thought to underlie the formation of association between a sensory 
stimulus and an ensuing threat, how the central amygdala participates in such learning process 
remains unclear. Here we show that a specific class of central amygdala neurons, the protein 
kinase C-δ-expressing neurons, is essential for the synaptic plasticity underlying learning in the 
lateral amygdala, as it is required for lateral amygdala neurons to respond to unconditioned 
stimulus, and furthermore carries information about the unconditioned stimulus to instruct 
learning. Our results uncover an amygdala functional organization that may play a key role in 
diverse learning processes.  
 
INTRODUCTION  
Adaptive behavioral responses to a threat are dependent on memories linking the threat with its 
associated environmental cues. Extensive evidence indicates that such memories are formed in 
the lateral amygdala (LA), in which coincident occurrences of a neutral environmental cue (also 
known as the conditioned stimulus (CS)) and a threatening event (also known as the 
unconditioned stimulus (US)), as exemplified in Pavlovian auditory fear conditioning (FC) by 
pairings of a sound with electrical footshock, induce Hebbian plasticity (Duvarci and Pare, 2014; 
Grundemann and Luthi, 2015; Herry and Johansen, 2014; LeDoux, 2000). This plasticity, 
expressed as strengthening of the synapses onto LA neurons driven by inputs carrying CS 
information, is associated with enhanced LA neuron responsiveness to the CS, required for the 
acquisition and recall of conditioned defensive responses, and thus, considered as a cellular

substrate of aversive memory (Duvarci and Pare, 2014; Grundemann and Luthi, 2015; Herry and 
Johansen, 2014; LeDoux, 2000). 
 
Recent studies demonstrate that the central amygdala (CeA), specifically its lateral division 
(CeL), is another amygdala nucleus indispensable for learning during fear conditioning (Ciocchi 
et al., 2010; Goosens and Maren, 2003; Li et al., 2013; Penzo et al., 2014; Penzo et al., 2015; 
Wilensky et al., 2006; Yu et al., 2016). Other studies also implicate the CeA in cognitive 
functions, such as attention (Calu et al., 2010; Lee et al., 2011; Roesch et al., 2012), that are 
critical for learning. Nevertheless, how the CeL contributes to the learning process that links 
environmental cues with threats remains poorly understood.  
 
In traditional views of the fear circuit, the LA and the CeA are the main input and output, 
respectively, nuclei of the amygdala, so that information flows from the LA to the CeA (Herry 
and Johansen, 2014; LeDoux, 2007; Wilensky et al., 2006). Surprisingly, direct evidence 
supporting such serial information processing in FC has been lacking. On the other hand, 
previous studies have described functions of the CeA – including its involvement in the attention 
or alerting processes – that are independent of the LA during reinforcement learning (Balleine 
and Killcross, 2006; Haney et al., 2010; Roesch et al., 2012), suggesting that the two nuclei are 
not simply organized in series. In this study, we used a combination of electrophysiological, 
molecular, optogenetic, chemogenetic, and in vivo calcium imaging techniques to examine the 
functional relationship between distinct classes of CeA neurons and LA neurons in FC.

Somatostatin-expressing CeL neurons are not required for the FC-induced LA synaptic 
plasticity 
We reasoned that, if information indeed flows serially from the LA to the CeA during FC, then 
inhibiting the CeA should leave the FC-induced LA synaptic plasticity intact. To test this 
hypothesis, we set out to inhibit the major classes of CeA neurons in mice with the tetanus toxin 
light chain (TeLC), which blocks neurotransmitter release (Murray et al., 2011). We first 
targeted somatostatin-expressing (SOM+) CeL neurons by bilaterally injecting the CeL of Som-
Cre mice, in which the Cre recombinase is expressed under the endogenous Som promoter 
(Taniguchi et al., 2011), with an adeno-associated virus expressing the TeLC-GFP or GFP (as a 
control) in a Cre-dependent manner (AAV-DIO-TeLC-GFP or AAV-DIO-GFP, respectively) 
(Murray et al., 2011) (Fig. 1A-F). In the same mice we also injected the auditory thalamus (the 
medial geniculate nucleus, MGN), which transmits CS information in auditory FC, with an AAV 
expressing the light-gated cation channel channelrhodopsin (AAV-CAG-ChR2(H134R)-eYFP) 
(Zhang et al., 2006) (Fig. 1A, F).  
 
After viral expression had reached optimal levels, we subjected the mice to auditory FC followed 
by preparation of acute brain slices, in which we recorded from LA neurons the AMPA receptor 
(A) and the NMDA receptor (N) mediated components of synaptic responses evoked by light-
stimulation of MGN axons (Fig. 1A-C). As expected, inhibition of SOM+ CeL neurons did not 
affect the FC-induced synaptic strengthening, measured as an increase in A/N ratio (Clem and 
Huganir, 2010; Nabavi et al., 2014), onto LA neurons (Fig. 1B, C). This manipulation did cause 
impairment in conditioned freezing behavior – a characteristic defensive response in rodents

(LeDoux et al., 1988) (Fig. 1D) – an effect that is consistent with our previous findings (Li et al., 
2013; Penzo et al., 2015).  
 
Protein kinase C-δ-expressing CeL neurons are required for the FC-induced LA synaptic 
plasticity and learning 
We next examined the effects of inhibiting protein kinase C-δ-expressing (PKC-δ+) CeL 
neurons, another major population in the CeL, with the TeLC in Prkcd-Cre mice that express Cre 
in PKC-δ+ CeL neurons (Haubensak et al., 2010) (Fig. 2A-D, Fig. S1A-C). To our surprise, 
inhibiting PKC-δ+ CeL neurons completely abolished the FC-induced synaptic strengthening 
onto LA neurons (Fig. 2A-C). Notably, unilateral inhibition of PKC-δ+ CeL neurons was 
sufficient to abolish the synaptic strengthening in the ipsilateral LA, while leaving that in the 
contralateral LA intact (Fig. 2B, C). Furthermore, bilateral inhibition of PKC-δ+ CeL neurons 
drastically impaired conditioned freezing (Fig. 2D; Fig. S1A, B), while unilateral inhibition of 
these neurons was less effective (Fig. S1A). Bilateral inhibition of PKC-δ+ CeL neurons also 
completely abolished conditioned lick-suppression, wherein a sound predicting tail shock 
suppresses licking for water rewards (Yu et al., 2016) (Fig. 3) (see Methods). Such conditioned 
suppression of action, like the conditioned freezing, has been shown to depend on both LA 
plasticity (Erlich et al., 2012; Nabavi et al., 2014) and CeA function (Killcross et al., 1997; Yu et 
al., 2016). 
 
The behavioral effect of PKC-δ+ CeL neuron inhibition is likely caused by impairment in 
learning rather than expression of the defensive responses, as suggested by the impaired LA 
synaptic plasticity. To verify this possibility we used optogenetics, for which we bilaterally

injected the CeL of the Prkcd-Cre mice with a Cre-dependent AAV expressing the light-
sensitive proton pump archaerhodopsin (Chow et al., 2010) (AAV-DIO-Arch-GFP), and 
subsequently implanted optical fibres above the CeL for light delivery (Fig. 2E, Fig. S1D, E). 
Optogenetic inhibition of PKC-δ+ CeL neurons during conditioning, but not during memory 
recall, significantly reduced conditioned freezing behavior (Fig. 2F). Together, these results 
indicate that the activity of PKC-δ+ CeL neurons is required for both the FC-induced LA 
synaptic plasticity and learning.  
 
Of note, it has been proposed that PKC-δ+ CeL neurons have a different function, such that 
inhibition of these neurons may cause freezing through disinhibition of the medial division of the 
CeA (CeM) (Haubensak et al., 2010). However, we found that optogenetic inhibition of PKC-δ+ 
CeL neurons failed to induce any freezing behavior or aversive response in a real time place 
aversion (RTPA) task in naïve mice (Fig. S2). 
 
PKC-δ+ CeL neurons develop CS responses after fear conditioning 
Why are neurons in the CeL required for synaptic plasticity and learning in the LA? In auditory 
FC, the coincident detection of sound (CS) and shock (US) by LA neurons is thought to be a 
prerequisite for these neurons to undergo the synaptic strengthening underlying learning. While 
sound can reach the LA via the MGN and the auditory cortex, the route through which shock is 
transmitted to the LA remains unclear (Herry and Johansen, 2014). Interestingly, it has recently 
been shown that CeL neurons, including PKC-δ+ neurons, are the direct postsynaptic targets of 
the parabrachial nucleus (PBN) (Han et al., 2015), a brainstem structure that provides 
nociceptive signals, and that activation of the PBN–CeL pathway is sufficient to drive aversive

learning (Han et al., 2015; Sato et al., 2015). These findings raise the possibility that PKC-δ+ 
CeL neurons may participate in conveying US information during FC.  
 
To test this possibility, we examined whether and how PKC-δ+ CeL neurons might respond to 
US. We delivered GCaMP6, the genetically encoded calcium indicator (Chen et al., 2013), into 
PKC-δ+ neurons by injecting the CeL of the Prkcd-Cre;Som-Flp mice with an intersectional 
AAV-Con/Foff-GCaMP6m (Fenno et al., 2014). This strategy ensures specific infection of PKC-
δ+ neurons and avoids infection of a small fraction of CeL neurons expressing both PKC-δ and 
SOM (Li et al., 2013). The same mice were implanted in the CeL with gradient-index (GRIN) 
lenses, through which the calcium signals could be recorded using a miniature integrated 
fluorescence microscope (Fig. 4A; see Methods) (Ghosh et al., 2011; Jennings et al., 2015; 
Resendez et al., 2016; Ziv et al., 2013). We subsequently trained these mice in the conditioned 
lick-suppression task (Fig. 3) (Yu et al., 2016) while imaging PKC-δ+ CeL neuron calcium 
responses (Fig. 4A; Fig. S3).  
 
We identified active PKC-δ+ CeL neurons during habituation, conditioning and recall, based on 
the spontaneous activities and CS or US responses in these neurons (Fig. S3, S4; see Movie S1; 
and see Methods). The fractions of neurons showing CS-evoked responses were 10.2% (16/157), 
20.0% (38/190), and 26.5% (49/185) during habituation, conditioning, and recall, respectively (P 
< 0.05, χ2 test with Bonferroni’s correction, comparing habituation with other groups) (Fig. 4B-
D). On average, the CS responses of these neurons desensitized during habituation, but recovered 
quickly following US presentations during conditioning, and were enhanced during recall (Fig. 
4B-D). These results indicate that PKC-δ+ CeL neurons gain CS responses following FC.

PKC-δ+ CeL neurons show US responses that are modulated by expectation 
During conditioning, 48.9% (93/190) of PKC-δ+ CeL neurons showed prominent US-evoked 
responses (Fig. 4E, F; Fig. S4). Interestingly, these responses decreased as conditioning 
progressed (Fig. 4E, F), consistent with theories and evidence that instructive US signals are 
suppressed when they become expected (Belova et al., 2007; Fanselow, 1998; Johansen et al., 
2010; McNally et al., 2011; Ozawa et al., 2017; Rescorla and Wagner, 1972). To specifically test 
if expectation modulates the US responses, we tracked the responses of each PKC-δ+ CeL neuron 
to a series of US presentations, some of which were signaled by the CS while the others were 
delivered unexpectedly (Fig. 5A, B). We found that, among all the US-responsive neurons, 
21.1% had stronger responses, while 8.8% showed weaker responses to unsignaled than to 
signaled US (Fig. 5B-E). These results demonstrate that about half of PKC-δ+ CeL neurons show 
robust US responses, with a subpopulation of these neurons having US responses suppressed by 
expectation, the property of a teaching signal according to theories of fear conditioning (McNally 
et al., 2011). 
 
PKC-δ+ CeL neuron activity is required for the US responses of LA neurons 
We next examined the role of PKC-δ+ CeL neurons in conveying the US signal to the LA. We 
implanted GRIN lenses in the LA of Prkcd-Cre mice, in which the GCaMP6 was expressed in 
LA neurons by an AAV-hSyn-GCaMP6f, and in which an inhibitory DREADD (Designer 
Receptor Exclusively Activated by Designer Drug) molecule derived from the kappa-opioid 
receptor (KORD) (Fig. S5) (Vardy et al., 2015) was selectively expressed in PKC-δ+ CeL 
neurons by an AAV-hSyn-DIO-HA-KORD (Fig. 6A, Fig. S6). This strategy allowed us to track

the US responses of the same LA neurons (see Fig. S7; Movie S2) before and after transiently 
inhibiting PKC-δ+ CeL neurons with systemically applied salvinorin B (SALB), the agonist of 
KORD (Vardy et al., 2015) (Fig. 6; Fig. S6, S7). Notably, we found that inhibition of PKC-δ+ 
CeL neurons significantly suppressed shock-evoked responses of LA neurons (Fig. 6B-E), 
indicating that PKC-δ+ CeL neurons play an important role in conveying the US signal to the 
LA. 
 
PKC-δ+ CeL neurons convey aversive information and drive learning 
If the US response of PKC-δ+ CeL neurons represents a teaching signal in FC, then it may also 
carry negative emotional valence and, moreover, be able to instruct learning. Indeed, we found 
that inhibition of these neurons with the TeLC reduced animals’ reaction to electrical shocks 
(Fig. 7A), suggesting that these neurons are important for processing the affective component of 
the US. Conversely, optogenetic activation of PKC-δ+ CeL neurons induced aversion in mice in 
the RTPA task (Fig. 7B, C; Fig. S8A), and caused marked lick suppression (Fig. 8A; Fig. S8A) 
(again, for the experiments in Fig. 7B, C and Fig. 8A, we injected the CeL of Prkcd-Cre;Som-
Flp mice with an intersectional AAV-Con/Foff-ChR2-mCherry (Fenno et al., 2014), to selectively 
infect PKC-δ+ neurons while avoid infecting the small fraction of CeL neurons expressing both 
PKC-δ and SOM (Li et al., 2013)).  
 
Furthermore, optogenetic activation of PKC-δ+ CeL neurons can be substituted for US to 
condition the mice for lick-suppression (Fig. 8B, C; Fig. S8B). PKC-δ+ CeL neuron activation 
appeared less efficient than tail shocks for the conditioning (see Fig. 3 & Fig. S3), likely because 
SOM+ CeL neuron activation is also required for learning and expression of the conditioned lick-

suppression (Yu et al., 2016). We therefore tested whether PKC-δ+ CeL neuron activation could 
induce conditioned place aversion, a learned avoidance response that does not depend on SOM+ 
CeL neurons (see (Tan et al., 2012; Yu et al., 2016)). As expected, pairing optogenetic activation 
of PKC-δ+ CeL neurons with one side of a chamber readily caused mice to avoid that side when 
tested in the following day (Fig. 8D; Fig. S8B). Together, these results indicate that PKC-δ+ CeL 
neurons convey aversive information and are sufficient to drive aversive learning.  
 
DISCUSSION 
Altogether, our results indicate that PKC-δ+ CeL neurons constitute a key node in a pathway that 
imparts information about US to the LA during FC, hence revealing a previously unknown 
amygdala functional organization, in which the CeL is upstream of the LA in processing aversive 
US during learning. In light of the current findings, together with recent discoveries that SOM+ 
CeL neurons are essential for both acquisition and expression of conditioned freezing behavior 
(Fig. 1D) (Li et al., 2013; Penzo et al., 2014; Penzo et al., 2015) and lick-suppression (Yu et al., 
2016), we propose that the CeL participates in at least two distinct processes in FC (Fig. 8E): 
while PKC-δ+ CeL neurons convey the US information that serves as a “teaching signal” to 
instruct plasticity and learning in the LA, SOM+ CeL neurons undergo conditioning-induced 
synaptic plasticity that, together with the plasticity in the LA and elsewhere in the memory 
encoding network (Duvarci and Pare, 2014; Grundemann and Luthi, 2015; Herry and Johansen, 
2014; LeDoux, 2000), enables the expression of learned defensive responses, in particular those 
of the passive type such as freezing behavior and suppression of action (Li et al., 2013; Penzo et 
al., 2014; Penzo et al., 2015; Yu et al., 2016).

The function of PKC-δ+ CeL neurons that we identify here may explain previous observations 
that the activities of some of the CeA neurons signal attention or salience (Calu et al., 2010; 
Roesch et al., 2012). Such function could be mediated by PKC-δ+ CeL neurons’ control over 
neuromodulatory systems. Indeed, these neurons project to and control the activity of different 
neuronal populations in the substantia innominata (SI) (data not shown; see also an 
accompanying paper in this issue of Neuron by Haohong Li and colleagues), a basal forebrain 
structure in which the cholinergic neurons have been implicated in attention and arousal (Hangya 
et al., 2015; Lin et al., 2015; Luchicchi et al., 2014). Of note, a recent study demonstrates that 
these cholinergic neurons send dense projections to the BLA, are critical for fear conditioning, 
and regulate BLA neuronal activity and synaptic plasticity (Jiang et al., 2016). It is therefore 
possible that SI cholinergic neurons may participate in carrying out the function of PKC-δ+ CeL 
neurons (Fig. 8E). Alternatively, or additionally, as PKC-δ+ CeL neurons have diverse projection 
targets (for reference, see an accompanying paper in this issue of Neuron by Haohong Li and 
colleagues), pathways other than that to the SI might mediate the function of these neurons. 
 
Our findings also revise a prevalent model for the functional organization of amygdala circuits, 
which posits that PKC-δ+ CeL neurons are “fear-off” neurons – a CeL population that shows 
inhibitory CS responses following fear conditioning (Ciocchi et al., 2010) – that act to suppress 
fear responses through inhibition of amygdala output (Haubensak et al., 2010). In fact, we show 
that a substantial population of PKC-δ+ CeL neurons are essentially “fear-on” neurons and 
function in the opposite manner by conveying aversive US signals. These US signals likely come 
from the PBN or the periaqueductal gray (PAG) (Fig. 8E), in which neurons have been shown to 
provide either nociceptive or teaching signals, respectively, to the amygdala during fear

Fig. 8. PKC-δ+ CeL neurons drive aversive learning. (A) Average lick rate of mice in which 
PKC-δ+ CeL neurons expressed ChR2. The blue bar denotes the time when light (473 nm, 30 Hz 
5 ms pulses) was delivered to the CeL. Shaded area represents s.e.m. (B) A schematic of the 
experimental procedure. (C) Lick suppression, measured as suppression index, during baseline 
(habituation) and after conditioning (recall) by pairing sound with light stimulation of the CeL in 
mice in which PKC-δ+ CeL neurons expressed GFP (control) or ChR2 (control: n = 11, T(10) = 
1, P > 0.05, paired t test; ChR2: n = 13, T(12) = 2.24, *P < 0.05, paired t test). (D) Place aversion 
during baseline (habituation) and after condition (recall) by pairing one side of a chamber with 
light stimulation of the CeL in mice in which PKC-δ+ CeL neurons expressed GFP (control) or 
ChR2 (control: n = 9, T(8) = 1.16, P > 0.05, paired t test; ChR2: n = 7, T(6) = 4.32, **P < 0.01, 
paired t test). (E) The proposed circuitry underlying classical fear conditioning. For clarity, only 
key known components of the circuitry are shown. Of note, both the PBN and the PAG may 
participate in providing the US signal during fear conditioning. As neurons in the CeL do not 
directly project to the LA, the question mark indicates structure(s) that may relay the teaching 
signal from the PKC-δ+ CeL neurons to the LA. Candidate structures include the SI or other 
areas innervated by PKC-δ+ CeL neurons. Data are presented as mean ± s.e.m. in A, C and D.

Before surgery, mice were group-housed under a 12-h light-dark cycle (7 a.m. to 7 p.m. light) 
with food and water freely available. Animals with implants were housed singly. The Som-cre 
(Taniguchi et al., 2011), Prkcd-Cre (Haubensak et al., 2010), Som-Flp (Penzo et al., 2015), Ai32 
and Ai35 (Madisen et al., 2012) mice have all been described elsewhere. The Som-Cre and Som-
Flp mice were provided by Dr. Z. Josh Huang. The Prkcd-Cre mice were purchased from the 
Mutant Mouse Regional Resource Centers (MMRRC) as cryo-preserved spermatozoa (Donor: 
Dr. Nathaniel Heintz). Other mice were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory. All mice were 
bred onto C57BL/6J genetic background. The Prkcd-Cre;Som-Flp mice were bred by crossing 
the Prkcd-Cre mice with Som-Flp mice. Male and female mice of 40–60 d of age were used for 
all the experiments. All procedures involving animals were approved by the Institute Animal 
Care and Use Committees of Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory and carried out in accordance with 
US National Institutes of Health standards.

viruses were made by the Stanford Vector Core (Stanford, CA). All viruses were stored in 
aliquots at –80 °C until use. We waited for at least 5 weeks after injection for optimal viral 
expression.

Stereotaxic surgery 
Standard surgical procedures were followed for stereotaxic injection (Li et al., 2013; Penzo et al., 
2015). Briefly, mice were either anesthetized with ketamine (100 mg per kg of body weight) 
supplemented with dexmedetomidine hydrochloride (0.4 mg per kg), or anesthetized with 
isoflurane (using 2% at the beginning and 0.5–1% for the rest of the surgery procedure). Mice 
were positioned in a stereotaxic injection frame and laid on a heating pad maintained at 35°C. A 
digital mouse brain atlas was linked to the injection frame to guide the identification and 
targeting (Angle Two Stereotaxic System, myNeuroLab.com).  
 
Viruses (~0.3 µl) were delivered with a glass micropipette (tip diameter, ~5 µm) through a skull 
window (1–2 mm2) by pressure applications (5–20 psi, 5–20 ms at 0.5 Hz) controlled by a 
Picrospritzer III (General Valve) and a pulse generator (Agilent). The injection was performed 
using the following stereotaxic coordinates for the CeL: −1.22 mm from Bregma, 2.9 mm lateral 
from the midline, and 4.6 mm vertical from skull surface; for the LA: −1.55 mm from Bregma, 
3.2 mm lateral from the midline, and 4.2 mm vertical from skull surface; for the MGN: −3.16 
mm from Bregma, 1.90 mm lateral from the midline, and 3.20 mm vertical from skull surface. 
For the in vivo photostimulation experiments, immediately after viral injection, mice were 
bilaterally implanted with optic fibers (core diameter, 105 µm; Thorlabs, Catalog number 
FG105UCA) that were placed above the CeL (coordinates of the fiber tip: −1.22 mm from 
Bregma, 2.9 mm lateral from the midline, and 4.3 mm vertical from skull surface). The optic 
fiber together with the ferrule (Thorlabs) was secured to the skull with C&B-Metabond Quick 
adhesive luting cement (Parkell Prod), followed by dental cement (Lang Dental Manufacturing).

For the in vivo imaging experiments, immediately after viral injection, a GRIN lens (diameter, 
500 µm; ~8.4mm length, part ID 130-000152; Inscopix) was implanted 200 µm above the center 
of injection.  
 
Following the above procedures, a small piece of metal bar was mounted on the skull, which was 
used to hold the mouse in the head fixation frame during experiments.  
 
Immunohistochemistry  
Immunohistochemistry experiments were performed following standard procedures. Briefly, 
mice were anesthetized with Euthasol (0.4 ml; Virbac, Fort Worth, Texas, USA) and 
transcardially perfused with 40 ml of PBS, followed by 40 ml of 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. 
Brains were extracted and further fixed in 4% PFA overnight followed by cryoprotection in a 
30% PBS-buffered sucrose solution for 36 h at 4 °C. Coronal sections (40 or 50 µm thickness) 
were cut using a freezing microtome (Leica SM 2010R, Leica). Sections were first washed in 
PBS (3 x 5 min), incubated in PBST (0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS) for 30 min at room temperature 
(RT) and then washed with PBS (3 x 5 min). Next, sections were blocked in 5% normal goat 
serum in PBST for 30 min at RT and then incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C. 
Sections were washed with PBS (5 x 15 min) and incubated with fluorescent secondary 
antibodies at RT for 1 h. After washing with PBS (5 x 15 min), sections were mounted onto 
slides with Fluoromount-G (eBioscience, San Diego, California, USA). Images were taken using 
a LSM 780 laser-scanning confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). The 
primary antibodies used were: rabbit anti-Somatostatin-14 (Peninsula Laboratories Inc., San 
Carlos, California, USA; catalogue number T-4103); mouse anti-PKC-δ (BD Biosciences, NJ,

anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) or Alexa Fluor® 488 goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) (Life Technologies, 
Carlsbad, California, USA; catalogue number A21207 or A11008, respectively), depending on 
the desired fluorescence color. 
 
In vitro electrophysiology  
To assess the synaptic plasticity in LA neurons induced by auditory fear conditioning, we 
specifically examined the synaptic transmission onto these neurons driven by the auditory 
thalamus – the medial geniculate nucleus (MGN) – that conveys the conditioned stimulus to the 
LA. To this end, we used mice in which the MGN was injected with the AAV-CAG-
ChR2(H134R)-YFP, so that the MGN–LA pathway can be optogenetically stimulated in acute 
slices. Patch clamp recording was performed as previously described (Li et al., 2013; Penzo et 
al., 2015). Briefly, mice were anesthetized with isoflurane before they were decapitated; their 
brains were then dissected out and placed in ice chilled dissection buffer (110 mM choline 
chloride, 25 mM NaHCO3, 1.25 mM NaH2PO4, 2.5 mM KCl, 0.5 mM CaCl2, 7.0 mM MgCl2, 
25.0 mM glucose, 11.6 mM ascorbic acid and 3.1 mM pyruvic acid, gassed with 95% O2 and 5% 
CO2). An HM650 Vibrating-blade Microtome (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was then used to cut 
300 µm thick coronal sections that contained the amygdala. These slices were subsequently 
transferred to a storage chamber that contained oxygenated artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) 
(118 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl, 26.2 mM NaHCO3, 1 mM NaH2PO4, 20 mM glucose, 2 mM 
MgCl2 and 2 mM CaCl2, at 34 °C, pH 7.4, gassed with 95% O2 and 5% CO2). Following 40

min of recovery, slices were transferred to RT (20-24 °C), where they were continuously bathed 
in the ACSF.  
 
Visually guided whole-cell patch clamp recording from LA neurons was obtained with 
Multiclamp 700B amplifiers and pCLAMP 10 software (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, 
California, USA), and was guided using an Olympus BX51 microscope equipped with both 
transmitted and epifluorescence light sources (Olympus Corporation, Shinjuku, Tokyo, Japan). 
LA pyramidal neurons were identified for patching. Light-stimulation was used to evoke 
excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) driven by the ChR2-expressing axons originating from 
the MGN. The light source was a single-wavelength LED system (λ = 470 nm; CoolLED.com) 
connected to the epifluorescence port of the Olympus BX51 microscope. Light pulses of 0.2–0.5 
ms, triggered by a TTL signal from the Clampex software (Molecular Devices), were used to 
evoke synaptic transmission. Synaptic responses were low-pass filtered at 1 KHz and recorded at 
holding potentials of –70 mV (for AMPA-receptor-mediated responses) and +40 mV (for 
NMDA-receptor-mediated responses). The AMPA/NMDA (A/N) ratio was calculated as the 
ratio of peak current at –70 mV to the current at 100 ms after light-stimulation onset at +40 mV 
(Clem and Huganir, 2010). Recordings were made in the ACSF with picrotoxin (100 µM) added. 
The internal solution contained 115 mM caesium methanesulphonate, 20 mM CsCl, 10 mM 
HEPES, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 4 mM Na2ATP, 0.4 mM Na3GTP, 10 mM sodium phosphocreatine 
and 0.6 mM EGTA (pH 7.2). The EPSCs were analysed using pCLAMP10 software (Molecular 
Devices).

Fear conditioning measuring conditioned freezing 
We followed standard procedures for conventional auditory fear conditioning (Li et al., 2013; 
Penzo et al., 2014; Penzo et al., 2015). Briefly, mice were initially handled and habituated to a 
conditioning cage, which was a mouse test cage (18 cm × 18 cm × 30 cm) with an electrifiable 
floor connected to a H13-15 shock generator (Coulbourn Instruments). The test cage was located 
inside a sound attenuated cabinet (H10-24A; Coulbourn Instruments). Before each conditioning 
session the test cage was wiped clean with 70% ethanol. During conditioning the cabinet was 
illuminated and the behaviour was captured with a monochrome CCD-camera (Panasonic WV-
BP334) at 3.7 Hz and stored on a personal computer. The FreezeFrame software (Coulbourn 
Instruments) was used to control the delivery of both tones and foot shocks. For habituation, five 
4-kHz, 75-dB tones (conditioned stimulus), each of which was 30 s in duration, were delivered at 
variable intervals. During conditioning, mice received five presentations of the conditioned 
stimulus, each of which co-terminated with a 2-s, 0.7-mA foot shock (unconditioned stimulus). 
The recall of fear memory was tested 24 h following conditioning in a novel illuminated context, 
where mice were exposed to two presentations of unreinforced conditioned stimulus (120 s inter-
stimulus interval). The novel context was a cage with a different shape (22 cm × 22 cm × 21 cm) 
and floor texture compared with the conditioning cage. Prior to each use the floor and walls of 
the cage were wiped clean with 0.5% acetic acid to make the scent distinct from that of the 
conditioning cage. Freezing responses to the conditioned stimuli were analyzed with 
FreezeFrame software (Coulbourn Instruments). The average of the freezing responses to the two 
conditioned stimuli during recall was used as an index of the conditioned fear.

As previously described (Yu et al., 2016), water deprivation started 23 hours before training. 
Mice were trained to stay on a movable wheel under head fixation for 30 minutes in the first day, 
and 10 minutes daily afterwards. A metal spout was placed in front of animal mouth for water 
delivery. The spout also served as part of a custom “lickometer” circuit, which registered a lick 
event each time a mouse completed the circuit by licking the spout. The lick events were 
recorded by a computer through a custom software written in LabView (National Instruments). 
Each lick triggered a single opening of a water valve calibrated to deliver 0.3 µl water.   
It took mice 4–7 days to achieve stable licking, the criterion for which was 10-minute continuous 
lick without any gap longer than 10 s. 
 
Mice with stable licking behavior were first subjected to sound habituation sessions (1 session / 
day for two days), during which auditory stimuli were presented through a computer speaker in 
each trial. Each stimulus was composed of 5 pips of pure tone (8 kHz, 70 dB). Pip duration was 
250 ms, and inter-pip-interval was 750 ms. Each of the habituation sessions contained 15 trials 
with variable inter-trial-intervals (30-50 s). 24 h following habituation, mice were conditioned 
for 15 trials with variable inter-trial-intervals (30-50 s). In each of these trials, the auditory 
stimulus (CS) was presented and followed immediately by a tail shock (US; 100 µA for 500 ms), 
which was generated from an isolator (ISO-Flex, A.M.P. Instruments LTD, Israel) and delivered 
through a pair of wires secured to the tail with silicone tubing. 
 
We used a lick suppression index to quantify animals’ performance in this task: Lick suppression 
index = (LPRE – LCS) / (LPRE + LCS), where LPRE is the number of licks in the 5 s period 
before CS onset, and LCS is the number of licks in the 5 s CS period (Yu et al., 2016).

Real time place aversion (RTPA) 
As previously described (Stephenson-Jones et al., 2016), one side of a custom chamber (23 × 33 
× 25 cm; made from plexiglass) was assigned as the stimulation zone, counterbalanced among 
mice. Mice were placed individually in the middle of the chamber at the onset of the experiment, 
the duration of which was 20 min. Laser stimulation (5-ms pulses delivered at 5, 10, or 30 Hz) 
was triggered when mice entered the stimulation zone, and lasted until mice exited the 
stimulation zone. Mice were videotaped with a CCD camera interfaced with the Ethovision 
software (Noldus Information Technologies), which was used to control the laser stimulation and 
extract the behavioral parameters (position, time, distance, and velocity). 
 
Conditioned place aversion 
The same chamber as that for the RTPA was used for the conditioned place aversion test. To 
make the two sides of the chamber distinct from each other, each side was decorated with a 
unique visual pattern (dotted vs striped) and scented with a unique odor (cherry vs. blueberry). 
The test consisted four sessions, each per day for four consecutive days. In session 1, the 
habituation session, mice were individually placed in the center of the chamber and allowed to 
freely explore both sides. In session 2 and 3, the conditioning sessions, the mice received 10 
trials of laser stimulation, each consisting of a10-s train of 30-Hz 5-ms pulses, in one side of the 
chamber that was chosen as the stimulation side (counterbalanced among mice). The exit of the 
stimulation side was blocked during the conditioning. In session 4, the recall session, the mice 
were allowed to freely explore both sides of the chamber. The mice were videotaped in session 1 
and 4 with a CCD camera interfaced with the Ethovision software (Noldus Information

Technologies), which was used to control the laser stimulation and extract the behavioral 
parameters (position, time, distance, and velocity) (Stephenson-Jones et al., 2016). 
 
In vivo optogenetics 
For bilateral optogenetic stimulation in the CeL in behaving mice, a rotary joint (Doric Lenses, 
Inc., Quebec, Canada, Catalog number FRJ_1x2i_FC-2M3_0.22) was used in the light delivery 
path, with one end of the rotary joint connected to a laser source (λ = 473 or 532 nm, OEM Laser 
Systems) and the other end, which has two terminals, to two optic fibers (for bilateral 
stimulation) through sleeves (Thorlabs). This configuration allows the mice carrying fiber-optic 
implants to freely move during optogenetic stimulation. The stimulation was typically composed 
of 5-ms 30-Hz light pulses delivered for various durations, unless otherwise specified. Laser 
intensity was 10 mW measured at the end of optic fibers.  
 
In vivo calcium imaging and analysis 
We followed a recently described procedure for the in vivo imaging experiments (Resendez et 
al., 2016). All imaging experiments were conducted on awake behaving mice under head fixation 
in a dark, sound attenuated box. GCaMP6 fluorescence signals were imaged using a miniature, 
integrated fluorescence microscope system (Inscopix, Palo Alto, CA) with GRIN lenses 
implanted in the target areas (CeL and LA). We imaged PKC-δ+ CeL neuron activities while 
subjecting the mice to sound habituation, conditioning and recall sessions in the conditioned lick 
suppression task. Each session contained 15 trials, with random inter-trial-intervals (10-30 s). 
The same mice were subsequently used to image PKC-δ+ CeL responses to signaled and 
unsignaled shocks. A total of 16 shocks, 8 signaled and 8 unsignaled, were delivered in a

randomly interleaved manner. In addition, the assignment of the first trial as having a signaled or 
unsignaled shock was counterbalanced among the mice.  
 
We also imaged LA neuron responses to shocks before and after subcutaneous injection (s.c.) of 
SALB (10 mg / kg of body weight) (to inhibit PKC-δ+ CeL neurons). As a control experiment, 
we imaged LA neuron responses to shocks before and after systemic application (s.c.) of DMSO 
(the vehicle of SALB). Each session contained 15 trials.  
 
For the experiments in which PKC-δ+ CeL neurons were imaged, we installed a baseplate on top 
of the GRIN lens for each mouse, as described previously (Resendez et al., 2016). Before 
imaging, the miniature microscope was attached to the baseplate. The microscope was adjusted 
such that the best dynamic fluorescence signals were at the focal plane, which was subsequently 
kept constant across imaging sessions. For the experiments in which LA neurons were imaged, 
the microscope was mounted on top of, and aligned with the GRIN lens with a custom adjustable 
micromanipulator that allows movement in all 3 axes. The focus of the microscope was adjusted 
through the micromanipulator to get the best focal plane as described above. 
 
During imaging, the Data Acquisition Box of the nVista Imaging System (Inscopix, Palo Alto, 
CA) was triggered by an NI data acquisition device (USB6008, National Instruments, CA). 
Compressed gray scale images were then recorded with nVistaHDV2 (Inscopix) at 10 frames per 
second. The analog gain (1 to 5) and LED output power (8% to 30% of the maximum) of the 
microscope were set to be constant for the same subject across imaging sessions. During 
imaging, the time stamps of different events, including the trigger signals sent to the microscope,

the auditory stimuli, the electrical shocks, and the licks, were recorded with a custom program 
written in LabView (National Instruments, CA).  
 
For imaging data processing and analysis, we began by importing the compressed video files into 
Mosaic (version 1.0.0b; Inscopix, Palo Alto, CA), in which we trimmed the first frame of the 
video for each trial to minimize the influence of the flash associated with LED light onset. We 
subsequently used Mosaic to combine all the trimmed video files into a single .tiff stack, apply a 
4-pixel bin to the .tiff stack, and correct the motion artifact. A new .tiff stack was then saved for 
further processing.  
 
Next, to address the problem of high levels of background fluorescence signals intrinsic to one-
photon imaging, we applied our newly developed imaging analysis method, the extended 
Constrained Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (CNMF-E) (Zhou et al., 2016), in which we 
model the background with two realistic components: (1) one models the constant baseline and 
slow trends of each pixel, and (2) the other models the fast fluctuations from out-of-focus signals 
and is therefore constrained to have low spatial-frequency structure. This decomposition avoids 
cellular signals being absorbed into the background term. After subtracting the background 
approximated with this model, we used Constrained Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (CNMF) 
(Pnevmatikakis et al., 2016) to demix neural signals and get their denoised and deconvolved 
temporal activity, termed as ΔF. The CNMF-E method was carried out using a custom Matlab 
algorithm (for a detailed description of this method, see (Zhou et al., 2016)).

Once the temporal activity of the neurons was extracted, we characterized the CS (sound) or US 
(shock) responses of each neuron using auROC (area under the receiver-operating characteristic 
curve) analysis, in which we compared the average ΔF values during the baseline period (2 s 
immediately prior to the delivery of CS or US) with that during CS or US presentations (2 s 
immediately after the onset of CS or US) by moving a criterion from zero to the maximum ΔF 
value. We then plotted the probability that the ΔF values during CS or US presentations was 
greater than the criteria against the probability that the baseline ΔF values was greater than the 
criteria. The area under this curve quantifies the degree of overlap between the two ΔF 
distributions (i.e., the discriminability of the two). A permutation test (iteration 5000 times) was 
used to determine whether the average ΔF values during CS or US presentations were 
significantly (P < 0.05) higher than during baseline, and thus classify a neuron as being CS- 
responsive or US-responsive, respectively. The peak CS or US response amplitude in each trail 
was determined by searching the maximum value within a 5-s time window immediately after 
stimulus onset.  
 
Statistics and data presentation 
All statistics are indicated where used. Statistic analyses were performed with Origin8 Software 
(OriginLab Corporation, Northampton, MA), GraphPad Prism Software (GraphPad Software, 
Inc., La Jolla, CA), or Matlab (MathWorks, Natick, MA). All behavioral experiments were 
controlled by computer systems, and data were collected and analyzed in an automated and 
unbiased way. Virus-injected animals in which the injection site was incorrect were excluded. 
For in vivo imaging, a mouse was excluded if the tract and tip of the GRIN lens was outside of 
the targeted area. No other mice or data points were excluded.
