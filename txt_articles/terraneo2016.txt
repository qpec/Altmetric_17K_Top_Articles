Abstract
Recent animal studies demonstrate that compulsive cocaine seeking strongly reduces prelimbic
frontal cortex activity, while optogenetic stimulation of this brain area significantly inhibits
compulsive cocaine seeking, providing a strong rationale for applying brain stimulation to
reduce cocaine consumption. Thus, we employed repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation
(rTMS), to test if dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) stimulation might prevent cocaine use
in humans. Thirty-two cocaine-addicted patients were randomly assigned to either the
experimental group (rTMS) on the left DLPFC, or to a control group (pharmacological agents)
during a 29-day study (Stage 1). This was followed by a 63-day follow-up (Stage 2), during which
all participants were offered rTMS treatment. Amongst the patients who completed Stage 1, 16
were in the rTMS group (100%) and 13 in the control group (81%). No significant adverse events
were noted. During Stage 1, there were a significantly higher number of cocaine-free urine drug
tests in the rTMS group compared to control (p=0.004). Craving for cocaine was also
significantly lower in the rTMS group compared to the controls (p=0.038). Out of 13 patients
who completed Stage 1 in the control group, 10 patients received rTMS treatment during Stage
2 and showed significant improvement with favorable outcomes becoming comparable to those
of the rTMS group. The present preliminary findings support the safety of rTMS in cocaine-
addicted patients, and suggest its potential therapeutic role for rTMS-driven PFC stimulation in

Introduction
Cocaine use disorder (CUD) represents a significant health
problem and is very common worldwide, with about 14–21
million users in 2014 (European Monitoring Centre for Drugs
and Drug Addiction, 2014). In spite of the significant
morbidity associated with cocaine use, no unequivocally
effective pharmacological or psychological therapies have
been identified to date. Chronic cocaine use causes damage
and changes in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) (Volkow et al.,
2004a),
including
significant
brain
volume
reduction
(Moreno-López et al., 2012; Matochik et al., 2003), cortical
hypoactivity (Goldstein and Volkow, 2002, 2011; Kaufman
et al., 2003), impairment in executive functions, and
dysregulation of neurotransmitters systems (Volkow et al.,
2003; Licata and Renshaw, 2010; Ke et al., 2004).
Physiologically, the PFC is thought to play a critical role in
the addictive cycle, including reinforcement learning, crav-
ing, and inhibitory control (Koob and Volkow, 2010). Impor-
tantly, preclinical studies have also shown that loss of
inhibitory control, resulting from damage to the PFC, seems
to be crucial in compulsive drug-seeking behaviors (Jasinska
et al., 2014; Chen et al., 2013). In particular, recent
research employed a rat model in which compulsive cocaine
seeking persisted in a subgroup of rats despite delivery of
mild foot shocks, and demonstrated that prolonged cocaine
self-administration
significantly
decreased
in
vivo
and
ex vivo intrinsic excitability of deep layer pyramidal neurons
in the prelimbic cortex (PLC), which was significantly more
pronounced in compulsive drug-seeking animals. Further-
more, in vivo optogenetic prelimbic cortex stimulation
significantly prevented compulsive cocaine seeking (Chen
et al., 2013). These findings created a rationale, and
additional data to test the hypothesis that stimulation of
functionally equivalent brain regions in humans could
reduce cocaine seeking and consumption.
Several studies indicate that the rodent PLC is the closest
functional homolog of the dorsolateral PFC (DLPFC) in
humans (Papaleo et al., 2012; Balleine and Dickinson,
1998), while others suggest a functional correspondence
with the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) (Gass and Chandler,
2013). Consensus on this matter is still lacking, due to the
extraordinarily large anatomical diversity between the
rodent and the human frontal/anterior cortices, but both
DLPFC and ACC play a major role in top–down inhibitory
control and reward mechanisms. They are also linked
structurally and functionally (Holroyd and Coles, 2002), as
it has been shown that neurostimulation of DLPFC has direct
effects over ACC (Conti and Nakamura-Palacios, 2014).
Therefore, a direct clinical translation of the previous
preclinical literature (Chen et al., 2013) could be attempted
by testing the hypothesis that electrical stimulation of the
DLPFC significantly decreases compulsive cocaine seeking beha-
viors. Operationally, this hypothesis can be tested by using
transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), a non-invasive, and
safe, human brain stimulation technology based on electro-
magnetic induction (Lefaucheur et al., 2014; Barker et al.,
1985). The TMS-induced intracranial electric field can be of
sufficient magnitude to depolarize neurons (Terao and Ugawa,
2002; Di Lazzaro et al., 2008). The extent of the induced field
depends on the TMS coil geometry and size; figure-of-eight coils
allow relatively focal targeting of the brain surface (Cohen
et al., 1990). While the effects of an individual TMS pulse lasts
only a fraction of a second, when TMS pulses are applied
repetitively, they can modulate long-term cortical excitability.
Specifically, repetitive TMS (rTMS) at a low frequency (about
1 Hz) is typically considered to have inhibitory effects, (Chen
et al., 1997) while high-frequency rTMS (Z5 Hz) is excitatory
(Pascual-Leone et al., 1994). Therefore, this pilot study was
conducted to test whether excitatory rTMS of the left DLPFC in
cocaine-dependent patients is safe and reduces cocaine use.

Experimental procedures
2.1.
Study design
This was a between-subject open-label randomized clinical trial
with rTMS vs. standard treatment (experimental vs. control group,
respectively) conducted at the Department of Neuroscience Out-
patient Clinic of the teaching hospital affiliated with the medical
school of the University of Padua, Italy. The appropriate local Ethics
Committee reviewed and approved the study. Patients were indivi-
duals seeking outpatient treatment for CUD. For inclusion/exclusion
criteria, see Table 1.
2.2.
Treatment conditions
2.2.1.
Experimental group:
The experimental group was treated with rTMS. The stimulator device
was a MagPro R30 with the Cool-B70 figure-of-eight coil (MagVenture,
Falun, Denmark). Resting Motor Threshold (rMT) measurements were
performed via visual twitch in the contralateral (right) hand. The coil
was positioned over the supposed motor cortex area, then the coil was
moved until the location at which a reproducible APB (abductor pollicis
brevis) response, elicited at the lowest stimulator intensity could be
identified. We determined the lowest device output to produce the
thumb movement 50% of the trials (Ziemann and Hallett, 2000), using
single-pulse TMS with at least 6 seconds between pulses, and that was
set as rMT
. To best identify the target of the rTMS stimulation, the left

 DLPFC, we used a TMS Navigator (LOCALITE, St. Augustin, Germany),
using individual level MRIs. The coil was placed as follows. The TMS
navigation system was used only during an initial planning session where
the subject's head was fitted with an individual TMS cap. The MRI of the
participant was co-registered and stretched using linear methods (9
degrees-of-freedom) to match the MNI template brain with the Localite
navigation software. Thereafter
, the TMS coil center was placed at MNI
coordinates [x= �50, y=30, z=36] with the coil handle pointing 451
relative to the midsagittal line. This coil location was marked on the
cap. During the subsequent therapy sessions, the TMS coil was placed in
the same position using the cap markings. In order to assure that the
cap was placed exactly in the same place at each session, the distance
from nasion, inion and set ears was determined for each patient.
The TMS parameters were as follows: 15 Hz frequency, pulse
intensity 100% of the rMT
, 60 pulses per train, inter train pause of
15 s, 40 stimulation trains, and 2400 total pulses for a total duration of
13 min. These parameters were based on two previous studies where
rTMS has been used to treat CUD patients. The first one (Camprodon
et al., 2007) used 10 Hz, 90% threshold, and 2000 total pulses, the
second one (Politi et al., 2008) used 15 Hz, 100% threshold, and 600
total pulses. The first study included six patients and one treatment
session only, whereas the second study had thirty-six patients and ten
rTMS sessions. rTMS parameters in these studies seemed quite con-
servative. Thus, we decided to modify the previous study settings, by
trying to set a higher level of stimulation, yet widely respecting the
safety guidelines (Rossi et al., 2009).
2.2.2.
Control group
The control group was treated with an established protocol used at the
Department of Neuroscience of the University of Padua, Italy, where the
study was conducted. This protocol included pharmacological treatment
with pramipexole 0.35 mg t.i.d., bupropione 150 mg daily, oxazepam
15 mg t.i.d., triazolam 0.25 mg daily, and gamma hydroxybutyrate
1.75 g daily. The rationale for using these medications was that: 1)
depressive, anxiety- and sleep-related symptoms are often present in
CUD patients that stop using cocaine; and 2) these medications used at
the doses reported above may improve these symptoms. Specifically,
bupropione (Reimherr et al., 1998) and pramipexole (Corrigan et al.,
2000; Mah et al., 2011) may improve depressive symptoms, oxazepam
(Ansseau et al., 1990) may relief anxiety-related symptoms and
triazolam (Pakes et al., 1981), and gamma hydroxybutyrate (Mamelak
et al., 1985) may improve sleep problems.
No alcohol use was allowed during the study, as it would be a
potential confounder. Considering that social/binge drinkers were
allowed to be in the study if they did not satisfy criteria for alcohol
use disorder, all patients enrolled in the study were asked to abstain
from alcohol use during the duration of the study. In order to assure
compliance, disulfiram 400 mg daily was administered during the
duration of the study.
2.2.3.
Study procedures
The study consisted of three stages: in-person screening (Stage 0),
29-day randomized treatment (Stage 1), and 63-day follow-up
(Stage 2).
2.2.3.1.
Stage 0 (Screening). Potential participants were recruited
among those referred to the Outpatient Clinic seeking treatment for
CUD. Screening included psychological assessments, medical history,
physical exam, and urine labs.
2.2.3.2.
Stage 1 (Treatment). Eligible participants were rando-
mized to the rTMS or control group for 29 days. Both groups were
seen with the same frequency in the Outpatient Clinic, i.e. once a day
during the first five days, and then twice a week for the following
three weeks. The control group was treated pharmacologically, as
detailed before, while the experimental group received one rTMS
session per day during the first five days of treatment, and then once a
week for the following three weeks, for a total of 8 rTMS sessions. The
length of each visit was approximately the same across both groups
(e.g., while patients enrolled in the experimental group were receiv-
ing the TMS session, those in the control group received medical
management for the pharmacological treatment). At each visit,
possible adverse events (AEs) were evaluated, previous cocaine use
was determined via a urine drug test and craving for cocaine was
assessed using a 0–10 Visual Analog Scale. The urine drug screen panel
also included the following: morphine, methadone, THC, phencycli-
dine, amphetamine, and methamphetamine.
2.2.3.3.
Stage 2 (Follow-up). At the end of the 29-day treatment
stage, a 63-day follow-up took place during which participants were
offered to continue being followed-up with the same treatment
received during the Stage 1, or to switch to the other treatment. For
those participants in the control group that agreed to receive rTMS
sessions during the Stage 2, a 1 week wash-out window from the
pharmacological treatments was applied before starting the first
rTMS session. During the Stage 2, rTMS took place (if applicable) once
a week for the rTMS group, while the others received a rTMS session
per day during the first five days of treatment, and then once a week
for the following weeks as in the Stage 1 rTMS group. Adverse events
and cocaine use via urine drug test were monitored twice a week.
3.
Study outcomes and assessments
3.1.
Adverse events (AEs)
Adverse events experienced by the participants in response
to treatment was collected during each visit by the study
physicians.
3.1.1.
Cocaine use outcomes
Primary outcome was the use of cocaine during Stage 1,
assessed as either a positive or negative urine drug screen for
cocaine in the rTMS vs. control groups. As expected, at the
beginning of the treatment, all patients had drug urine screen
positive for cocaine. Consistent with the potential positivity of a
urine drug screen due to cocaine metabolites, a grace period
was applied for the first 8 days of Stage 1. Therefore, except for
the baseline comparisons and AE analyzes, all other analyzes
were conducted starting on Day 9. Secondary outcomes
included cocaine use during Stage 2, including comparisons to
Stage 1 (within-subject comparisons), and cocaine craving.

 3.1.2.
Assessment of depressive symptoms
Given the high comorbidity between CUD and depression
(Hatzigiakoumis et al., 2011; Roy et al., 2015), depressive
symptoms were assessed. The depression subscale of the
SCL-90 (Lipman, 1986) was used; its validity, compared to
the standard Hamilton Depression Scale, has been shown
(Bech et al., 2014). The SCL-90 was administered at base-
line (pre-treatment), and then at Day 5 and Day 29.
4.
Statistical analysis
In univariate analysis, for normally distributed variables the
Student t-test between groups was used, while for categorical
variables the Chi Squared test was performed. In multivariate
analysis, the logistic regression was performed. McNemar Chi
squared test was used to test for significance in repeated
measure for dichotomous variables. Kaplan Meier curves were
used to plot the cumulated proportion of event free patients in
the groups: significance between pairs of curves was tested by
Log-Rank. For craving evaluation, Anova for Repeated Measure
was performed to assess the interaction between group and
craving decrease. The significance level was set at po0.05.
5.
Results
5.1.
Participant characteristics
Of 45 individuals screened in the Clinic, 32 CUD patients were
eligible, signed the informed consent and were randomized
(rTMS group, n=16; control group, n=16). The consent form
included information regarding the experimental nature of
the rTMS treatment, as well as the fact that CUD is not an
indication for the medications used in the control group.
Figure 1 outlines the study flow, including reasons why 13
subjects were excluded. Baseline characteristics of the
enrolled patients are shown in Table 2. The two groups were
comparable for baseline and demographic characteristics,
with the exception of age (Table 2), which was therefore
used as a covariate in the analysis.
Twenty-nine participants (rTMS group, n=16; control
group, n=13) completed Stage 1. Out of the 16 participants
assigned to the experimental group, one subject did not
complete the follow-up (Stage 2), dropping out at day 46 of
Stage 2, while the other 15 patients continued, therefore
receiving weekly rTMS sessions. Out of the 13 participants
who completed Stage 1 in the control group, 10 participants
switched to weekly rTMS sessions during Stage 2, while
2 wanted to continue the standard treatment (both of them
had good response during Stage 1, as also documented by
negative urine drug screens) and 1 participant decided to
discontinue completely the Stage 2 follow-up (Figure 1).
5.2.
Safety
A few participants in the rTMS group reported mild dis-
comfort at the start of stimulation, especially during the
first session, but overall there were no significant differ-
ences in AEs across groups. rTMS treatment was safe and
there were no serious or unexpected adverse events (AEs).
During the duration of the study, 5 patients had a
positive urine drug screen for THC (3 in the rTMS group
and 2 in the control group). No urine drug screens were
positive for the other drugs assessed (morphine, metha-
done, phencyclidine, amphetamine, and methampheta-
mine) during the study.
5.3.
Cocaine use outcomes
Consistent with the intention to treat analysis, the outcome
was defined positive if the patient never relapsed (i.e., urine
drug screen was always negative after the grace period)
during Stage 1, while it was defined negative if there was at
least one relapse (i.e., at least 1 urine drug screen positive
for cocaine after the grace period) or if the patient dropped
out during Stage 1. Positive outcomes were 11 (69%) in the
rTMS group and 3 (19%) in the control group. A univariate
analysis demonstrated that, during Stage 1, the difference in
the number of positive outcomes between the two groups
was statistically significant (Chi square, p=0.004).
Considering the difference in age between the two groups
(Table 2), a multivariate analysis was conducted next, using
Figure 1

 the logistic regression model adjusted for age (a variable for
which the two groups showed significant difference). This
analysis indicated that the effect of the therapy remained
significant (p=0.035) with an OR=6.47 (95% CI 1.14=
�36.6), while the effect of age was not statistically
significant (p=0.102). We also conducted a Kaplan Meier
curve where the event was positive drug screen; this
analysis confirmed a significant difference between rTMS
and standard treatment (log rank p=0.0013) (Figure 2).
5.4.
Outcomes during the Stage 2 follow-up
Out of the 10 patients in the control group who switched to
the rTMS treatment during Stage 2, three patients presented
with a positive drug screen. A within-subject comparison
indicated that during Stage 1, eight had a positive drug
screen with standard treatment. This difference was signifi-
cant using the McNemar Chi square (one tail, p=0.037).
Next, we performed a logistic regression model adjusted
for age, to compare the results of the rTMS group with the
control group that moved to rTMS during Stage 2. Specifically,
the comparison was made between the rTMS group in Stage 1
(the period from Day 12 to 29), and the control group in
Stage 2 (the period from Day 47 and 64) who shifted to TMS
treatment. The regression model showed no significant
difference related to the shift (p=0.64) and age (p=0.17).
5.5.
Craving
During Stage 1, there was a significant difference in cocaine
craving scores, i.e. craving was significantly lower in the
rTMS
group
vs.
controls
[F(1,27)=4,7379,
p=0.038;
Figure 3]. During Stage 2, a comparison of the groups (both
treated with rTMS during this stage) revealed no significant
difference in craving (p40.05).
5.6.
Depressive symptoms
There were no differences on the SCL-90 depression sub-
scale score at baseline (pre-treatment) between the two
groups (p40.05). During the Stage 1 treatment, there was
an improvement on depressive symptoms in both groups,
but there were no differences between the two groups [F
(2,54)=0.70963, p=0.49].
6.
Discussion
This study provides strong and novel, albeit preliminary
information, on the role of rTMS and the DLPFC in treating
cocaine addiction. Study limitations need to be acknowl-
edged, in particular: the small sample, the open-label
design, the lack of urine drug screen for benzodiazepines,
and the short duration of treatment. Another important
limitation was the use of a control group treated pharma-
cologically (as opposed to a sham group). It is also important
to highlight that there are no formal data, in terms of
efficacy and safety, on the combined use of these medica-
tions, although no serious or unexpected side-effects were
reported in our control group.
While disulfiram administration was used to assure compli-
ance to total alcohol abstinence, it has been suggested that
disulfiram may have anti-craving properties in cocaine addiction

Transcranial magnetic stimulation and cocaine use disorder
Please cite this article as: Terraneo, A., et al., Transcranial magnetic stimulation of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex reduces cocaine use: A
pilot study. European Neuropsychopharmacology (2015), http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.euroneuro.2015.11.011
 (Suh et al., 2006). As such, disulfiram might also have improved
the cocaine use outcomes in our study. However
, it is unlikely
that disulfiram acted as a confounder to our findings, given that
it was used in both groups, and still a significant effect of rTMS
on our outcomes was found. Nonetheless, future studies testing
the role of rTMS in CUD patients should consider alternative
non-pharmacological approaches to assure compliance to alco-
hol abstinence. This consideration is also important given that
the combination of cocaine with the disulfiram–alcohol inter-
action can be associated with side-effects, including potentially
severe cardiovascular problems (Karila et al. 2008).
In spite of these limitations, this study supports both the
safety of the use of rTMS in CUD patients, and it represents
the first preliminary clinical evidence of rTMS efficacy in
treating CUD patients. Notably, this study used a cocaine
urine drug screen as the primary outcome, thereby provid-
ing an objective marker of response as opposed to self-
reported assessments.
From a safety standpoint, while rTMS has been recently
established as a safe therapeutic tool, it is important to keep
in mind that most of the literature on rTMS does not include
CUD patients. These patients may present with long-lasting
adaptations and changes in the brain. Given that rTMS
treatment results in functional changes in brain activity,
establishing the safety of rTMS administration in CUD patients
is important. Notably, patients enrolled in this study were all
active CUD subjects, and all of them presented with urine
drug tests positive for cocaine at the time the first TMS
session took place. As such, this study provides much needed
safety information on the use of rTMS in this population.
Animal and human studies demonstrate that rTMS alters
cortical excitability through the modulation of different
neurotransmitters involved in addiction-related processing,
including dopamine and GABA (Barr et al., 2011). Combined
rTMS/PET studies in healthy subjects demonstrated that rTMS
over the DLPFC resulted in increased levels of extracellular
dopamine (Cho and Strafella, 2009), and induced dopamine
release in the caudate nucleus (Strafella et al., 2001), while
dopaminergic activity was reduced during withdrawal (Volkow
et al., 2004b). Additionally, rTMS has been shown to enhance
GABA neurotransmission (McDonnell et al., 2006) through
increased cortical inhibitory activity (Daskalakis et al., 2006).
Previous studies provide additional support for the use of
rTMS in cocaine abusers. In fact, two previous clinical studies
(Camprodon et al., 2007; Politi et al., 2008) indicated that
rTMS over DLPFC resulted in decreased self-reported cocaine
craving in cocaine-dependent patients. However
, none of
these studies (one of which included only six patients)
addressed if, beyond reducing a subjective outcome such as
cocaine craving, rTMS was useful in reducing cocaine use,
which is not only an objective outcome, but also the most
relevant outcome from a clinical standpoint. This study also
holds important and unprecedented translational significance.
The fact that rTMS treatment applied to DLPFC reduced
cocaine use and craving in humans is strikingly consistent with
recent preclinical findings showing a marked reduction in
prelimbic cortex excitability in compulsive cocaine seeking
rats (Chen et al., 2013), further highlighting the importance of
rodent studies to provide rationale for designing clinical trials.
In this study, there was no significant improvement of
depressive symptoms in the rTMS group compared to the
control group. This observation is consistent with recent work
indicating a lack of antidepressant efficacy for treatment of
CUD (Pani et al., 2011), and that changes in depressive
symptoms did not predict future cocaine abstinence (Milby
et al., 2015). As such, it seems unlikely that our results were
due to an improvement in depressive symptoms, given that
rTMS was significantly more effective than the control group
on the cocaine outcomes, but not on the depressive symp-
toms. However
, it is important to keep in mind the high
comorbidity between CUD and depression (Hatzigiakoumis
et al., 2011; Roy et al., 2015), as well as the preliminary
nature of the present study. As such, future randomized
controlled trials and mechanistic studies are needed to shed
light on the potential role of rTMS in treatment of CUD
patients with depression comorbidity, and on the potential
action mechanisms of how rTMS may improve cocaine out-
comes, i.e. directly acting on craving for cocaine, and/or
indirectly acting via an improvement of depressive symptoms.
Although controlled studies are needed to establish
efficacy, the results of this study tentatively suggest that
rTMS is an effective treatment for CUD. Not only does our
study confirm previous observations on reduced cocaine
craving after rTMS (Camprodon et al., 2007; Politi et al.,
2008), but it also provides much needed novel information.
In fact, this is the first clinical report indicating that rTMS
treatment resulted in significant reduction in cocaine use.
As such, this study holds critical clinical importance. While
reduction in craving is important; cocaine abstinence
represents the most critical achievement goal from a
clinical standpoint.
In conclusion, while important limitations need to be
kept in mind, this study supports the safety and potential
efficacy of rTMS in treating cocaine addicts, and paves the
way for larger, double-blind, sham-controlled, and rando-
mized clinical trials to build on these promising, yet
preliminary findings.
