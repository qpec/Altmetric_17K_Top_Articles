ABSTRACT: The ability to activate drugs only at desired
locations avoiding systemic immunosuppression and other
dose limiting toxicities is highly desirable. Here we present a
new approach, named local drug activation, that uses
bioorthogonal chemistry to concentrate and activate systemic
small molecules at a location of choice. This method is
independent of endogenous cellular or environmental markers
and only depends on the presence of a preimplanted
biomaterial near a desired site (e.g., tumor). We demonstrate
the clear therapeutic benefit with minimal side effects of this approach in mice over systemic therapy using a doxorubicin pro-
drug against xenograft tumors of a type of soft tissue sarcoma (HT1080).
S
oft tissue sarcoma (STS) is an aggressive malignant tumor
diagnosed in more than 12,000 people in the United States
per year,1,2 and its incidence is increasing.3 About 6000 patients
die from this disease every year.3−5 This heterogeneous disease
with more than 100 types and subtypes6 disproportionately
affects the young, accounting for 15−20% of childhood cancer,
and 10% of neoplasms in adolescents and young adults.7 It
usually starts as a local mass in a limb (40−60%) or
retroperitoneum (15−20%).3,4,8 Current management includes
imaging, biopsy for staging purposes, and wide surgical
resection with curative intent.1−3,9,10 Microscopic positive
margins, local recurrence, unresectable tumors, and metastasis
are ominous characteristics that correlate with a major increase
in morbidity and mortality.3,11−13 In order to minimize those
events, radiation and chemotherapy are used as neoadjuvant
(before surgery) or adjuvant therapy (after surgery).1−3,14−18
Radiation therapy improves local control in the pre- or
postoperative management of STS by 30%,19 but the
limitations and side effects are not trivial, including the size
of the field, proximity to vital organs,10,20 20−30% increase in
wound complications,11,20,21 and even radiation-induced
sarcomas.11,13,22 Despite a response rate of only 16−27%, the
chemotherapy of choice against STS is doxorubicin as a single
agent or in combination.3,4,9,23−26 The primary mechanism of
action is based on inhibition of topoisomerase II leading to
cumulative DNA damage.14,27 The dose limiting toxicity of this
cytotoxic agent is bone marrow suppression, and the lifetime
cumulative dose is limited by anthracycline-induced cardiomy-
opathy.9,14 These side effects limit dosing options and lead to
poor patient compliance, even during clinical trials.28
Historical approaches to overcome these issues include
isolated limb perfusion,29,30 hyperthermic intraperitoneal
chemotherapy,30,31 high dose chemotherapy with hemato-
poietic stem-cell transplantation,32 and others with limited
improvements in efficacy.22,28,33 Drug delivery technologies
based on increased circulation and enhanced permeability and
retention (EPR) effect for doxorubicin have provided improve-
ments in the side effect profile, but no improvement in efficacy
for STS.33,34 Experimental35 and recently approved treat-
ments36,37 have only shown efficacy in a subset of STS
subtypes.36,38 The heterogeneity of this disease makes it an
elusive target for molecularly targeted therapies.39
Bioorthogonal chemistry has been explored in recent years to
achieve tissue-specific in vivo delivery of active biopharmaceut-
icals. In particular, the inverse-electron demand Diels−Alder
(IEDDA) reaction between trans-cyclooctene (TCO) and
tetrazine has been utilized for in vivo bioconjugation, capital-
izing on the fast reactivity of the two bioorthogonal groups,
their stability and inertness to biological functionalities. A
“tumor pretargeting” approach utilized TCO-conjugated anti-
bodies to deliver the bioorthogonal payload to cancerous cells
with a specific antigen (Figure 1A).40,41
Recent advances utilizing the “tumor pretargeting” approach
are outlined in Figure 1. This approach achieves in vivo
bioconjugation at picomolar levels.40 Targeted bioconjugation
at therapeutically relevant concentrations has proven to be very
challenging in vivo. A widely accepted model41 predicts that
IEDDA chemistry can lead to therapeutically positive outcomes
only upon optimization of both the reaction kinetics and the
pharmacokinetic profiles of the molecules carrying the two
bioorthogonal groups, limiting the opportunity for bioconjuga-
tion of small molecule drugs. The proposed solution is that
both bioorthogonal groups be attached to macromolecular

 structures, such as proteins or polymers (MW > 10 kDa)
increasing the half-life in the circulatory system (Figure 1B).
Here, we report a bioorthogonal chemistry-based approach
termed local drug activation that is capable of activating small
molecule pro-drugs at a location of choice, thereby allowing the
in vivo concentration of cytotoxic agents at a tumor site in
therapeutically meaningful quantities (Figures 1D). The
approach is based on a recent development of the IEDDA
chemistry that allows release of a payload attached to the TCO
group after the initial cycloaddition step (Figure 1C).42 As
illustrated in Figure 2, the approach starts with the injection of
the biocompatible hydrogel modified with tetrazine near the
mass where the drug is needed (Figure 2A). A drug with
attenuated activity containing a releasable TCO moiety (pro-
drug) is injected intravenously and travels through the
circulatory system (Figure 2B). When the pro-drug and the
hydrogel come near, the bioorthogonal agents react with each
other through the IEDDA reaction localizing the payload
(Figure 2C). The multivalency of the hydrogel’s surface
provides a large number of tetrazine groups capable of
concentrating the systemically administered small molecule
pro-drug, thus compensating for its suboptimal pharmacoki-
netic properties. Finally, the resulting intermediate isomerizes
spontaneously releasing the active drug from the hydrogel to
perform its therapeutic function locally (Figure 2D).
In contrast to other targeted therapies, such as ADCs, “tumor
pretargeting”, or the original report describing in vitro uncaging
of doxorubicin42 (Figure 1C), the local drug activation
approach provides a viable in vivo bioconjugation strategy for
small molecule pro-drugs. In addition, it does not rely on
endogenous molecular markers on the tumor cell surface, or
local processes like enzymatic activity or oxygen levels that are
characteristic of diseased tissue. As a result, this approach is not
encumbered by genetically and phenotypically heterogeneous
tumors such as soft tissue sarcoma that have proven elusive
targets.38 Additionally, the described system provides an
opportunity to modulate the therapeutic agent and dose
which can be administered in multiple rounds while there is an

 adequate number of tetrazine groups on the hydrogel’s surface
available for conjugation.
To evaluate the local drug activation strategy, we modified an
alginate hydrogel with tetrazine moieties (HMT), as shown in
Figure 3A. On the basis of
1H NMR analysis, HMT was
determined to contain about 400 nmol of tetrazine per
milligram of the material (Figure S6).43 Meanwhile, we also
converted doxorubicin (2), a well-known cytotoxic agent, into a
pro-drug by covalent modification with a trans-cyclooctene
moiety 3 (Figure 2B).42 This modification resulted in an agent
that is 57 times less active against HT1080 cells than regular
doxorubicin (Figure S1).
HMT was found to be very effective at capturing 3 in vitro.
When HMT and the doxorubicin pro-drug were mixed in PBS

injected into the area where the drugs are needed. (B) A drug covalently modified with a TCO carbamate (pro-drug) is given to the patient. (C)
When the pro-drug and the material come in contact, the rapid cycloaddition reaction enhances the amount of drug present at the desired location
with the concomitant release of a molecule of nitrogen. (D) The resulting cycloadduct isomerizes in vivo leading to decomposition of the self-
immolable carbamate linker, releasing an equivalent of carbon dioxide and most importantly the drug at the local site to perform its therapeutic
function.

 for 30 min at room temperature, over 99% of the compounds
detected in the supernatant were 2 as shown by high
performance liquid chromatography analysis (Figure 3B).
Subsequent daily measurements during a week detected only
the release of 2 (Figure 3B,C). This confirms that the
doxorubicin pro-drug is rapidly captured by the HMT and
that the product released from the material is unmodified
doxorubicin.
To evaluate the antitumor activity of the doxorubicin pro-
drug, we performed efficacy studies with athymic nude mice
bearing fibrosarcoma (HT-1080) xenografts, a type of human
soft tissue sarcoma that is often used to evaluate new therapies.
We report greater efficacy of the pro-drug treatment without
myelosuppresion and sustained tumor regression compared to
the standard of care (the maximum tolerable dose of systemic
doxorubicin).
HMT was injected through palpation immediately next to
the tumors 18 days after initial implantation when their size
reached an average of 195 mm3 (range, 90−500 mm3). The
mice were separated into two cohorts: (i) 3 intravenous doses
of 14 μmol/kg of standard doxorubicin every 4 days (maximum
tolerable dose),26,44,45 or (ii) daily doses of 14 μmol/kg of
doxorubicin pro-drug for 10 days (Figure 4B). Tumor volumes
were measured twice a week for 13 weeks after initiation of
therapy (Figure 4A). No further therapies were given to the
subjects 28 days post tumoral implantation (dpi). The animals
were humanely euthanized and removed from analysis as they
reached a tumor volume of 2000 mm3.
For both groups the median tumor size was undetectable 2
weeks after the last treatment dose (40 dpi). Thirty days after
the last treatment dose (60 dpi) the median tumor size of the
systemic doxorubicin cohort was greater than 2000 mm3, and
the mice were euthanized shortly therafter. This is consistent
with previous studies evaluating systemic doxorubicin on
HT1080.26,44,45 In contrast, the median tumor size of the
pro-drug cohort remained undetectable (P = 0.021). At 88 dpi,
half of the mice with tumors of the pro-drug cohort were
euthanized as they reached the end point. The other half of the
mice in the cohort did not show any detectable signs of tumors
and remained that way until the end of the study (118 dpi,
Figure 4B).
In order to exclude issues such as nonspecific in vivo
activation of the pro-drug or microenvironment changes due to
the placement of an alginate polymer, multiple additional
controls were tested (Figure S2). No differences in tumor
volume were observed between untreated mice and mice
treated with (i) local injection of HMT and i.v. administration
of saline, or (ii) local injection of unmodified alginate and i.v.
doxorubicin pro-drug administration. This confirms that the
pro-drug does not spontaneously turn into the regular
doxorubicin without the presence of the gel in clinically
meaningful quantities or that an inherent characteristic of the
pro-drug independent of the bioorthogonal reaction is
responsible for the increase in efficacy.
This bioorthogonal approach resulted in substantially lower
side-effects relative to the doxorubicin treatment. Myelosup-
pression is the main acute dose-limiting toxicity of doxorubicin.
A standard measure for this side effect is reticulocyte count,
based on short-lived precursors of red blood cells that are easily
quantified.26,44 The nadir of reticulocytes after systemic
doxorubicin occurs 3 days after the end of therapy.26,44 As
expected the systemic doxorobucin-treated cohort showed a
Figure 4. Therapeutic effect of doxorubicin pro-drug in a xenograft model of soft tissue sarcoma. (A) NCR/nu:nu mice were injected with human
HT-1080 fibrosarcoma cells at day 0. Tumors were then injected with HMT and started on intravenous doses of either doxorubicin pro-drug or a
maximum tolerable dose of doxorubicin. Tumor sizes were monitored for more than 16 weeks (n = 5−10). (B) The tumor size of the members of
each cohort at relevant time points in a logarithmic scale illustrate the differences between standard chemotherapy treatment and the material pro-
drug approach. P values were determined by unpaired t test. Solid bars represent the mean for each cohort (n = 5−10). (C) Evaluation of

 dramatic decrease in reticulocytes (P = 0.007) (Figure 4C). In
contrast, the cohort treated with doxorubicin pro-drug showed
reticulocyte counts similar to mice treated with vehicle.
Furthermore, mice treated with doxorubicin pro-drug did not
show any overt signs of toxicity, including weight loss or
changes in coat texture, while the regular doxorubicin cohort
lost on average about 20% of body weight (Figure 4D).
While tumor remission of 50% of the treatment group with
fewer side effects than the standard of care is remarkable, we
need further studies to evaluate nonrespondents and the
variables needed to maximize the response rate. The optimal
dosing schedule and placement of the hydrogel also needs to be
elucidated. Given the low level of toxicity observed, shorter
courses with higher doses, or longer courses with smaller doses
may be even more effective as has been recently suggested in
the literature.46,47 More studies are also needed to establish the
dose limiting toxicities of the pro-drug as well as the HMT and
the effect of the native tumor microenvironment on this
approach.
In summary, we have shown that the bioorthogonal
chemistry-based local drug activation approach is capable of
in vivo bioconjugation of small molecule pro-drugs at
therapeutically relevant concentrations. The “catch” step is
followed by local release of active cytotoxic agents in vivo. The
approach increases the efficacy of doxorubicin, by harnessing
the benefits of local activation via exogenous chemical factors,
minimizing systemic toxicity, and optimizing the local
therapeutic effects. Improved delivery of cytotoxic agents to a
desired area may increase the number of patients with
resectable tumors, as well as the number of resected tumors
with clean margins, improving patient outcomes. With regard
to distant micrometastasis, the low level of systemic toxicity of
the approach would not preclude the concomitant use of
systemic doxorubicin or alternative immunotherapies.
In recent years, the bond cleaving capabilities of the IEDDA
chemistry have found a number of intriguing applications such
as uncaging TCO-modified proteins48,49 or HPLC-free solid
phase synthesis of RNA.50 The potential applications of a
modified therapeutic agent that is concentrated and activated
by a preinjected material extend well beyond soft tissue
sarcoma and doxorubicin. In cancers with limited response, this
approach could be applied to a number of other therapeutic
agents, such as other cytotoxics, immunomodulating drugs,
radiomodulating entities as well as peptide- and gene-based
therapies. Decreased toxicity may improve patient compliance
for cytotoxic agents, enable therapies for people who are too
frail to receive them, or allow new pro-drug regimens to be
evaluated in combinations that were previously impossible due
to dose limiting toxicities. This approach presents a new
method for drug delivery orthogonal to endogenous markers
and has tremendous potential to improve the outcomes of
challenging neoplasms and other disease processes.
