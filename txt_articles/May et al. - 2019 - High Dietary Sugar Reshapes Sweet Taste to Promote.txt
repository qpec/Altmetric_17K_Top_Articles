In Brief
May et al. discover that excess dietary
sugar promotes overfeeding by dulling
sweet taste sensation in Drosophila
melanogaster. Deficits in taste function
occur independently of obesity and,
instead, develop because of higher
glucose utilization inside the gustatory
neurons. Correcting sweet taste function
prevents overconsumption and obesity in
animals fed a high sugar diet.

SUMMARY
Recent studies find that sugar tastes less intense to
humans with obesity, but whether this sensory
change is a cause or a consequence of obesity is
unclear. To tackle this question, we study the effects
of a high sugar diet on sweet taste sensation and
feeding behavior in Drosophila melanogaster. On
this diet, fruit flies have lower taste responses to
sweet stimuli, overconsume food, and develop
obesity. Excess dietary sugar, but not obesity or die-
tary sweetness alone, caused taste deficits and over-
eating via the cell-autonomous action of the sugar
sensor O-linked N-Acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc)
transferase (OGT) in the sweet-sensing neurons.
Correcting taste deficits by manipulating the excit-
ability of the sweet gustatory neurons or the levels
of OGT protected animals from diet-induced obesity.
Our work demonstrates that the reshaping of sweet
taste sensation by excess dietary sugar drives
obesity and highlights the role of glucose meta-
bolism in neural activity and behavior.
INTRODUCTION
Many arguments about the underlying cause in the rise of obesity
point toward the increased availability of highly palatable foods.
Such foods are thought to alter the activity of reward pathways at
least partly via their taste properties, and this leads to overcon-
sumption and weight gain (Small, 2009; Volkow et al., 2011).
No doubt the perception of palatable food qualities such as
sweetness plays a key role in eating behaviors. However, this
hypothesis does not fit with a growing body of evidence that
associates obesity with reduced taste perceptions (Bartoshuk
et al., 2006; Berthoud and Zheng, 2012; Rodin et al., 1976). Spe-
cifically, obesity has been associated with lower sweetness in-
tensity (Bartoshuk et al., 2006; Overberg et al., 2012; Sartor
et al., 2011) and sensitivity to sweet (Proserpio et al., 2016),
umami (Pepino et al., 2010), monosodium glutamate (MSG; Do-
naldson et al., 2009), and salt (Simchen et al., 2006; Skrandies
and Zschieschang, 2015). However, other studies reported no
or opposite associations between BMI and taste sensitivity
(Donaldson et al., 2009; Grinker, 1978; Hardikar et al., 2017;
Thompson et al., 1977). Recently, research on rodents found
that animals genetically prone to obesity or fed high energy diets
have decreased behavioral (Berthoud and Zheng, 2012; Chevrot
et al., 2013; Robinson et al., 2015) and physiological responses
of the taste buds to sweet or fatty stimuli (Maliphol et al., 2013;
Ozdener et al., 2014), changes in the number of taste buds (Kauf-
man et al., 2018), and lower expression of the sweet taste recep-
tors (Chen et al., 2010), but these changes were not causally
linked to taste function and feeding behavior. Thus, while there
is accumulating evidence that taste signals are dulled in obese
mammals, the picture is complex, and studies in model organ-
isms with a simpler taste system and conserved metabolism
would be greatly beneficial in probing the connection between
taste function, feeding behavior, and obesity. Here, we exploited
the relative simplicity of the Drosophila taste system, where the
sweet-sensing cells are neurons that project directly to the brain,
to tackle a number of important questions. First, do changes in
taste sensation occur with diet-induced obesity? Are these
changes a consequence of the altered physiology of the obese
state or do they result from chronic exposure to a high nutrient
diet? And, finally, if changes in taste function occur, what role
do they play in the etiology of obesity?
Using behavioral assays and in vivo imaging, we found that
fruit flies fed a high sugar diet show a dulled sense of sweet taste,
and that this occurs because of lower responses of the sweet

 taste neurons to sugar. This deficit is caused by excess dietary
sugar, not obesity, and is mediated by the increased activity of
the conserved sugar sensor O-linked N-Acetylglucosamine
(O-GlcNAc) Transferase (OGT) (Hanover et al., 2010; Hardiville
´
and Hart, 2014) in the sweet taste cells. By monitoring feeding
behavior at high resolution and using neuro- and optogenetic
manipulations of sweet taste cell excitability, we show the dulling
of sweet taste leads to overfeeding and obesity. Preventing a
decrease in sweet taste sensation rescues feeding and obesity
in animals exposed to the high sugar diet. Together, our results
implicate deficits in sweet taste as drivers of obesity and begin
to map the molecular underpinnings through which exposure
to excess dietary sugar reshapes taste function and behavior.
RESULTS
A Sugar Diet Promotes a Reduction in Sweet Taste
Responses Independently of Obesity
Recent reports found that humans with obesity and rodents fed
highly palatable diets have a dulled sense of sweet taste (Bar-
toshuk et al., 2006; Berthoud and Zheng, 2012; Overberg
et al., 2012; Pasquet et al., 2007; Proserpio et al., 2016; Sartor
et al., 2011). However, it is unclear whether this reduction is a
metabolic consequence of obesity or an effect of diet. To
address this question, we fed Drosophila melanogaster fruit flies
an established model of a high sugar diet (Musselman et al.,
2011; Musselman and K€
uhnlein, 2018) and assessed their taste
responses to sweet stimuli (see STAR Methods for dietary ma-
nipulations). Fruit flies fed a 30% sucrose diet for several weeks
develop obesity, metabolic syndrome, peripheral insulin resis-
tance, and recapitulate the hallmarks of kidney and heart disease
in their corresponding organs (Musselman et al., 2011; Mussel-
man and K€
uhnlein, 2018; Na et al., 2013). In contrast, short, up
to 1-week exposures to the high sugar diet (SD; 1.4 calories/
gram), lead to fat accumulation compared to animals on a control
diet (CD; 0.58 calories/gram), (Figures 1A and S1A), but have no
effect on Drosophila insulin-like peptide (dilp) transcript levels
(Figures S2A and S2B). The 30% sugar concentration in the
diet is similar to that found in many cookies available at grocery
stores; for comparison, mango and banana contain about �15%
sucrose, while the majority of children’s cereal in US grocery
stores has 45%–60% sugar content (Ng et al., 2012).
In Drosophila, taste cells are neurons that sense the environ-
ment through taste hairs located on the labellum at the tip of
the proboscis, the main taste organ in the fly (see Figure S3B
for a schematic of the anatomy). Taste neurons, which express
receptors for only one taste modality, send their projections to
the subesophageal zone (SEZ), the taste processing center in
the fly brain, where taste modalities remain segregated (Harris
et al., 2015; Marella et al., 2006; Scott, 2018). We examined fly
taste responses using the Proboscis Extension Response (PER)
assay, a behavioral measure of taste that records the magni-
tude of proboscis extension in response to stimulation of the
taste hairs with a sweet stimulus (Shiraiwa and Carlson,
2007). Age-matched flies fed a SD showed a rapid and pro-
gressive
decrease
in
taste responses
to
supra-threshold
(30%, 5%, and 1%) concentrations of sucrose with time (Fig-
ure 1B). In flies, gustatory receptor neurons are also located
in the legs and wings, and a SD also reduced proboscis re-
sponses induced by the stimulation of the leg sensory cells
(Figure S1B). The decrease in taste responses was not due to
motor defects because proboscis responses to the fatty acid
octanoic acid (Masek and Keene, 2013) were unchanged be-
tween flies on the two diets (Figure S1C). Furthermore, taste
deficits occurred regardless of fasting time (Figure S1D), ruling
out the possibility that they are a consequence of higher energy
stores in flies fed a SD. Thus, flies fed a SD have lower behav-
ioral responses to supra-threshold concentrations of sucrose.

 To determine if a SD diet also alters the thresholds for detection
of sweetness, we counted the percent of animals able to detect
the non-caloric sweetener L-glucose at different concentrations
in the range of 10–90 mM. We used L-glucose instead of other
sweet sugars to eliminate any potential post-ingestive effects
on food detection, since animals with impaired taste can still
detect the presence of nutritious sugars (de Araujo et al.,
2008; Dus et al., 2011; Stafford et al., 2012); the taste of
L-glucose is transduced through the same cellular and molec-
ular machinery as sucrose (Dus et al., 2013; Fujita and Tani-
mura, 2011). Compared to flies on a CD, animals fed a SD
had a taste detection curve shifted to higher concentrations
of the sweetener, suggesting that their sensitivity to sweetness
was also lower (Figure S1E).
To probe whether taste deficits were due to high dietary
sweetness, we examined the taste responses of animals fed
a sweet, non-caloric sucralose diet. However, taste re-
sponses to sucrose remained unchanged in these flies
(Figure 1C, dark green) and there was no fat accumulation
(Figure S1F). Similarly, flies fed a calorically dense (1.4 calo-
ries/gram as the 30% high sugar diet), but not sweet, lard-
supplemented diet accumulated fat (Figure S1G, lime green),
but had normal taste responses (Figure 1C), indicating that
sweetness or excessive calories alone are insufficient to
lower sweet taste sensation. In contrast, only sweet and
nutritious diets such as those supplemented with D-fructose,
D-glucose, and sucrose promoted a decrease in sweet taste
responses (Figure 1D).

In mammals, the molecular mechanisms
through which diet-induced obesity lowers
taste
sensation
are
unknown.
To
test
whether there is a connection between taste
deficits and obesity, we set out to genetically
uncouple excess body fat from dietary
sugar exposure. First, we tested the taste
responses of fly mutants for the adipose
triglyceride lipase brummer (bmm), which
is
involved
in
the
breakdown
of
fat
(Gro
¨ nke et al., 2005) (Figure 2A). The bmm mutants have as
much body fat on a control diet as wild-type flies on a SD (Fig-
ure 2B), but their taste responses as measured by PER were
normal on a CD and reduced on a SD (Figure 2C), suggesting
that obesity alone is not sufficient to promote a reduction
in sweet taste. This is consistent with our observation that
a lard diet had no effect on sweet taste (Figures 1C and
S1G). Next, we tested genetically lean flies to ask if a
decrease in taste responses was linked to high dietary sugar,
instead of obesity. perilipin2 (plin2) is a gene essential for fat
mobilization
(Beller
et
al.,
2010)
(Figure
2A);
despite
remaining lean (Figure 2B) and maintaining normal Drosophila
insulin-like peptide transcript levels on a SD (Figures S2A and
S2B), plin2 mutants experienced a comparable decrease in
taste responses relative to that of control and bmm mutant
flies (Figure 2C). These results suggest that obesity is neither
necessary nor sufficient for the reduction in sweet taste, and
that, instead, excess dietary sugar—but not just dietary
sweetness, since a sweet sucralose diet did not dull sweet
taste—may alter taste directly.
A High Sugar Diet Decreases the Responses of the
Sweet-Sensing Neurons to Sugar
To better understand how a sugar diet decreases sweet taste
sensation, we examined the physiology of the sweet taste
neurons. Since, we observed no changes in the number of
sweet taste neurons labeled by the sweet Gustatory Receptor
5a-GAL4 transgene (Chyb et al., 2003; Fujii et al., 2015; Marella
Cell Reports 27, 1675–1685, May 7, 2019
1677
 et al., 2006) driving GFP in the labellum of flies on a SD (Fig-
ure S3A), we reasoned that a high sugar diet may instead alter
the response of these neurons to sugar. To test this possibility,
we measured the in vivo, real-time responses of the sweet
Gustatory receptor 64f (Gr64f)+ (Dahanukar et al., 2007)
neurons to stimulation of the labellum with 30% sucrose
using the genetically encoded, presynaptic calcium sensor
GCaMP6s-Bruchpilot-mCherry
(Kiragasi
et
al.,
2017) (Fig-
ure 3A). Presynaptic responses to 30% sucrose stimulation of
the proboscis were identical after 1-day exposure to the SD,
but decreased gradually with longer exposures (Figures 3B
and 3C), which matched the magnitude and progression of
sweet taste deficits as measured by PER (Figure 1B). In addi-
tion, we also found that animals had fewer sugar-induced
action potentials after both short- and long-term exposure to
the SD (Figures S3B and S3C). Thus, exposure to high dietary
sugar decreases the responsiveness of the taste neurons to
sugar; while we measured both changes in presynaptic calcium
responses and action potentials, defects in synaptic activity
more faithfully track the decrease in PER.
A Sugar Diet Promotes Feeding by Increasing the Size
and Duration of Meals
To analyze the effects of changes in sweet taste function on
feeding behavior, we first examined the effects of excess
dietary sugar on feeding behavior using modifications to the
Fly-to-Liquid-Food-Interaction
Counter
(FLIC)
(Ro
et
al.,
2014), an assay that measures feeding behaviors by detecting
electronic signals, ‘‘licks,’’ when the fly proboscis touches the
food. By attaching food reservoirs to the FLIC apparatus, we
were able to record the feeding patterns of individual flies
continuously and at a high temporal resolution (5 Hz) for days
without disturbance or fasting. Because 30% sucrose was
viscous, we conducted the experiments with 20% sucrose,
which also promotes obesity and taste deficits (Figures S4A
and S4B). Control w1118CS flies fed a 5% sucrose control
diet while on the FLIC showed a stable number of licks per
day (Figure 4A, salmon). In contrast, flies fed a sweeter diet
of 20% sucrose, showed a progressive increase in licks over
time; by days 3–5 these flies licked more per day than those
fed 5% sucrose (Figure 4A, burgundy). Flies fed a CD or SD
in standard fly food vials for 10 days and placed on the FLIC
for a single day also showed an increase in licks on 20%
sucrose (Figure S4C). To better characterize the temporal dy-
namics and investigate the effect of diet on meal patterns, we
binned licks in 30-min intervals over many days for individual
flies (Figure 4B) and as a group average (Figure 4C). We found
that flies, like mammals, eat in discrete patterns, here termed
‘‘meals,’’ that closely follow circadian activity (Figures 4B and
4C). Flies on 20% sucrose still consumed only two meals per
day, but the peaks became higher and wider with more time
on the diet (Figure 4C). Furthermore, while the onset of each
morning (a.m.) and evening (p.m.) meal was similar to that of
flies on 5% sucrose, the offset changed with more days on
diet, suggesting that meals became longer while flies are eating
20% sucrose (Figure 4C). To quantify meal duration, we
measured the time of meal start and end for a.m. and p.m.
meals for each fly (Figure 4D). The duration of the a.m. and
p.m. meals of flies on 5% sucrose remained the same over
7 days (Figure 4E). In contrast, that of flies eating 20% sucrose
became longer with more days on diet. By day 7 the meal dura-
tion of flies eating 20% sucrose was twice as long as that of
flies eating 5% sucrose (Figure 4E). We next quantified the
size of each meal by calculating the area under each a.m.
and p.m. meal peak (Figure 4D, gray). Like with duration, the
size of each a.m. and p.m. meal increased with more days on
a 20% diet, while it stayed unchanged in flies eating 5% su-
crose (Figure 4F). Overall, we observed a strong relationship
between meal size and duration (Figures 4E and 4F), indicating
that longer meals may contribute to increased meal size.
Together,
our
high-resolution
analysis
of
meal
patterns
suggests that a high sugar diet alters feeding by extending
the duration and size of each meal, rather than by increasing
the number of meals per day, which points to potential changes
in satiety rather than hunger.
To investigate if these alterations in feeding behavior are a
consequence of diet-induced obesity (Figures 1A and 1B) or
possibly a result of high dietary sugar, we tested the feeding
patterns of genetically obese bmm and genetically lean plin2
mutant flies (Gro
¨ nke et al., 2005; Beller et al., 2010). The
bmm mutants, despite being as obese as control flies on a
SD (Figure 2B), showed similar patterns of feeding behavior
with diets as control flies (Figures 5A, 5C, 5E, and S5A–S5C
for controls). In contrast, 20% sucrose led to an increase in
meal size and duration even in the absence of obesity in
the plin2 mutant flies (Figures 5B, 5D, 5F, and S5A–S5C
for controls). These data suggest that obesity alone does not
drive the observed changes in feeding and open the possibility

 that, instead, these are a direct consequence of dietary sugar
and linked to changes in sweet taste sensation.
A Deficit in Sweet Taste Sensation Promotes Feeding
Behavior
Consumption of a high sugar diet promotes a decrease in the
responses of sweet taste neurons to sugar and an increase in
feeding. Are these phenomena linked and does a dulling of
sweet taste sensation contribute to overfeeding? If diet-depen-
dent deficits in sweet taste drive higher feeding behavior, then
preventing animals from experiencing these should rescue
overeating and obesity. To test this possibility, we expressed
the bacterial voltage-gated sodium channel NaChBac, which
is used to activate neurons in Drosophila (Nitabach et al.,
2006), exclusively in the sweet taste neurons using Gr64f-
GAL4 (Fujii et al., 2015) and assayed taste responses and
feeding behavior. The taste responses of Gr64f>NaChBac flies
were identical to those of genetic controls on a CD (Figure 6A).

 However, while control animals experienced a decrease in
sweet taste when fed the SD, Gr64f>NaChBac flies retained
the same taste responses to sucrose on both a CD and a SD
(Figure 6A; 20% and 30% sucrose stimuli). Since expression
of UAS-NaChBac in the Gr64f+ neurons corrected taste deficits
so that Gr64f>NaChBac animals do not experience a sugar-
diet-dependent decrease in taste function, we next measured
their feeding patterns. Gr64f>NaChBac flies fed 20% sucrose
showed little to no increase in feeding interactions compared
to controls (Figure 6B). In addition, while the meals of control
flies became longer, those of Gr64f>NaChBac animals stayed
the same (Figure 6C). Consistent with these data, Gr64f>NaCh-
Bac flies also remained lean on the SD, while control flies accu-
mulated fat (Figures 6D and S5D for adult-specific NaChBac
expression). Thus, preventing animals from experiencing a
diet-dependent decrease in sweet taste sensation rescued
feeding behavior and obesity.
To further test the hypothesis that a decrease in the activity of
the sweet taste neurons drives overfeeding, we used optoge-
netics to acutely activate the Gr64f+ neurons by expressing
the light-activated channel csChrimson (Klapoetke et al., 2014).
To ensure that the sweet taste neurons were activated only
during feeding, we developed a closed-loop system so that

eating.

dependent decrease in sweet taste function increases feeding
behavior and promotes obesity.
The Sugar Sensor OGT Mediates the Effects of Sugar on
Sweet Taste Sensation
We next probed how dietary sugar alters sweet taste sensation.
Our observations that a diet supplemented with the non-caloric
sweetener sucralose or a non-sweet, high-fat diet did not lower
sweet taste sensation (Figure 1C), while diets supplemented with
30% sucrose, D-fructose, or D-glucose decreased sweet taste
responses, suggest that glucose metabolism plays a role in
reducing sweet taste sensation (Figure 1D). The hexosamine
biosynthesis pathway (HBP) is a conserved nutrient-sensing
signaling pathway that mediates the deleterious effects of die-
tary sugar on cell physiology and has been implicated in most
diseases caused by high-nutrient diets, such as diabetes, kid-
ney, heart, and liver diseases (Hanover et al., 2010; Hardiville
´
and Hart, 2014). The levels of the metabolic end product of
HBP, uridine diphosphate N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc),
are increased by high nutrient diets; a single enzyme, OGT
(also known as super sex combs in Drosophila), adds the
O-GlcNAc moiety from UDP-GlcNAc onto the serine and threo-
nine residues of proteins to modify their activity, competing with
protein phosphorylation (Hanover et al., 2010; Hardiville
´ and
1680
Cell Reports 27, 1675–1685, May 7, 2019
 Hart, 2014) (see Figure S6A for schematic of the HBP). Recent
data suggest that OGT may also play a role in the brain: OGT ac-
tivity is high in neurons and regulates metabolism and synaptic
maturation (Lagerlo
¨ f et al., 2016, 2017; Ruan et al., 2014). In fly
heads, the levels of the first committed HBP metabolite glucos-
amine-6-phosphate were increased with a SD (Figure S6B). To
test if OGT mediates the molecular effects of a SD on sweet
taste, we used a previously characterized OGT RNAi transgene
(Radermacher et al., 2014) to knock it down in the Gr64f+ neu-
rons (50% knockdown efficiency; Figure S6C). Gr64f>OGT
knockdown (KD) animals had normal PER on a CD (Figure S6D),
but this manipulation rescued sweet taste responses on a SD
compared to controls (Figures 7A and S6E for a second indepen-
dent OGT RNAi transgene).
Since correcting a decrease in sweet taste sensation by
expression of NaChBac and activating the sweet taste cells
with csChrimson prevented increased feeding and obesity
(Figure 6), we asked if OGT KD could also restore feeding
behavior. Indeed, KD of OGT in the Gr64f+ cells prevented
feeding on 20% sucrose (Figure 7B); consistent with its
effect on feeding, Gr64f+ > OGT KD animals remained lean
compared to genetic control flies (Figure 7C). Thus, decreasing
OGT activity solely in the sweet taste neurons blocked the
effects of a sugar diet on taste responses, feeding behavior,
and obesity.
OGT integrates cell physiology and nutrient environment by
altering transcriptional and signaling pathways (Hanover et al.,
2010; Hardiville
´ and Hart, 2014). To identify the cellular pro-
cesses through which excess dietary sugar decreases sweet
taste function, we measured changes in RNA abundance in the
labella of flies fed a CD and a SD for 7 days and with OGT KD
(Table S1; Figure S7). Since knockdown of OGT in the sweet-
sensing cells restores taste function and prevents overfeeding
and obesity on a high sugar diet, we reasoned that the genes
altered on a sugar diet and important for taste function would
show an opposite expression trend when OGT is knocked
down (i.e., up in SD-down in OGT knockdown; down in SD-up
in OGT knockdown). To carry out this analysis, we first selected

 only the set of genes showing significant changes in labellar
expression between CD and SD (q < 0.2), and then conditioning
on membership in that set, calculated FDR-corrected p values
for the significance of changes in transcript level for the same
genes between the OGT KD animals and their corresponding
GAL4 control. Genes showing significant expression changes
in both RNA-seq experiments were classified based on the signs
of the observed log2-fold changes. Using this approach, we
found about �150 genes changed by diet and ‘‘reverted’’ in
Gr64f>OGT KD (Figure 7D). We used iPAGE, a pathway discov-
ery program (Goodarzi et al., 2009), to identify Gene Ontology
(GO) terms showing significant mutual information with the
expression status of genes as being in either one of the two
oppositely regulated categories (up or down or ‘‘reverting’’; Fig-
ure 7E). GO terms altered by a SD and reversed by OGT KD were
enriched in processes involved in neural function (regulation of
membrane potential, phototransduction, neurotransmitter trans-
porter activity) and metabolism (glutaminase activity, chitin cata-
bolic process, carbonate dehydratase activity). Combining these
results on gene expression with the targeted behavioral experi-
ments above, we propose a model where excess dietary sugar,
through the cell-autonomous action of OGT, leads to a decrease
in the responses of the sweet taste cells to sugar, which lowers
sweet taste sensation (Figure 7F). This weakening of sweet taste
alters feeding patterns to promote obesity, providing a mecha-
nism for how excess dietary sugar functions as a driver of
obesity.
DISCUSSION
Obesity has been linked to the high availability of affordable,
tasty foods that contain sugar as a food additive (Small, 2009;
Volkow et al., 2011). The increased eating in the presence of
these palatable foods seems to be an evolutionarily conserved

 behavior from flies to rodents and humans (Avena et al., 2008;
Small, 2009). How these foods promote eating is still an open
question with obvious public health implications. Changes in
taste sensation with dietary sugar or obesity have been exam-
ined in humans, but no consensus has been reached on their
role in feeding behavior and obesity (Bartoshuk et al., 2006; Ber-
thoud and Zheng, 2012; Grinker, 1978; Hardikar et al., 2017;
Overberg et al., 2012; Pasquet et al., 2007; Proserpio et al.,
2016; Sartor et al., 2011; Thompson et al., 1977). Studies in ro-
dent models found changes in behavior and physiology consis-
tent with a decrease in taste function with diet-induced obesity,
but did not draw a causal connection between the two (Chevrot
et al., 2013; Kaufman et al., 2018; Maliphol et al., 2013; Ozdener
et al., 2014; Robinson et al., 2015). Here, we show in fruit flies
that excess dietary sugar, independently of obesity, causes a
decrease in sweet taste function because of lower responses
of the taste cells to sugar stimuli—similar to what was observed
in the isolated taste buds of mice fed a high-fat diet (Maliphol
et al., 2013). This dulling, in turn, promotes eating and obesity
by increasing the duration and size of meals. Correcting taste
deficits by activating the sweet-sensing cells so that the animals
do not experience a lowering of their sweet taste world pre-
vented overeating and obesity, drawing a causal link between
diet-induced changes in taste function and obesity.
Diet composition is well known to change sensory perceptions
(Hill, 2004). For example, high dietary sodium alters the intensity
for salt perception in humans (Bertino et al., 1982; Huggins et al.,
1992) and rodents (Contreras and Frank, 1979; Hill et al., 1986)
and this promotes higher sodium intake (Bertino et al., 1982;
Huggins et al., 1992). Exposure to savory or bitter foods in devel-
opment or adulthood also alters taste preference across
species, from humans (Mennella and Trabulsi, 2012), to mice
(Ackroff et al., 2012), to invertebrates like Manduca and
Drosophila (Glendinning et al., 2001; Zhang et al., 2013). Here,
we show that, as with high dietary sodium, in flies excess dietary
sugar decreases sweet taste sensation and promotes overcon-
sumption. How this occurs remains an open question, and raises
the intriguing possibility that the dulling of sweet taste may
contribute to changes in the central reward processing of food
observed in humans with obesity (Kroemer and Small, 2016).
An exciting finding from our work is the role of glucose
metabolism in altering neural activity and behavior. While our
experiments do not exclude the possibility that peripheral insulin
resistance may also play a role in taste changes, they do high-
light the role of the enzyme OGT as a potential modulator of
sweet taste neuron function. OGT activity was recently reported
to modulate synapse maturation and behavior (Lagerlo
¨ f et al.,
2016, 2017; Ruan et al., 2014). There are a few examples where
metabolic sensors have been implicated in the modulation of
neural activity, such as target of rapamycin (TOR) and eukaryotic
translation elongation factor 2 (eEF2) (Davis, 2013), raising the
interesting question of whether OGT may also function in a
similar manner in the taste neurons. While the exact molecular
mechanisms by which OGT mediates the effects of excess
dietary sugar on sweet taste neuron physiology remain to be
understood, our analysis indicates that OGT alters the expres-
sion of genes involved in neural function and metabolism. Given
the conservation of OGT function from flies to humans, and the
role of OGT in the etiology of obesity and diabetes (Hanover
et al., 2010; Hardiville
´ and Hart, 2014), our findings raise the
exciting possibility that increased OGT activity may act to dull
taste function in response to excess dietary sugar in mammals.
Finally, our work also brings to light the broader question of
how diet may impact brain physiology and behavior through its
action on metabolic pathways and their by-products.
Together, the identification of the neural and molecular under-
pinnings of diet-induced alterations in taste promises an avenue
of investigation that is broadly relevant to understanding the
etiology of obesity in humans. Based on our work and available
human and rodent studies, the development of public health or
therapeutic solutions that seek to correct dietary sweetness
and the weakening of taste sensation may help curb the spread
of obesity and reduce the risk of chronic disease.

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS
Drosophila melanogaster
Flies were grown and maintained on cornmeal food (Bloomington Food B recipe) at 25�C and 45%–55% humidity under a 12:12 hour
light-dark cycle (ZT0 at 7 AM) for all experiments. We collected male flies under CO2 anesthesia at day 1-3 after eclosion. After collec-
tion, flies were aged for an additional 1-2 days before starting experiments, except in the case of lines carrying RNAi constructs,
which were allowed to age with parental controls for an additional 5-6 days to promote expression of the RNAi transgene and knock-
down of the target gene. For dietary manipulations, age-matched male flies were placed on either Bloomington Food B or Blooming-
ton Food B supplemented with different sugars (See Dietary manipulations in Method Details) in groups of 30-35 flies. In experiments
where flies were fasted (e.g., PER), all flies were food-deprived for 18-24 h. For optogenetic manipulations, flies were maintained on
Bloomington cornmeal food supplemented with 200 mM all-trans-retinal for 6 days in the dark. For all manipulations, flies were
changed to new food vials every other day.
The GAL4-UAS system was used to express the transgenes of interest in specific neuron subtypes. For each GAL4/UAS cross,
transgenic controls were made by crossing the w1118CS (gift from A. Simon) to GAL4 or UAS flies, sex-matched to those used in
the GAL4/UAS cross. For the complete genotypes of fly lines used in our manuscript, see the Key Resources Table.
GAL4 was expressed in sweet taste neurons by using the Gr64f (gift from H. Amrein) or Gr5a (gift from K. Scott) promoters. For
neuron visualization and cell counting, we used UAS-nls-GFP (Bloomington #4775). UAS-GCaMP6s-Brp-mCherry (Bloomington
#77131) was used for visualization of calcium transients in axon terminals. We used UAS-NaChBac (gift from M. Nitabach) and
UAS-csChrimson (Bloomington #55135) to increase the excitability of sweet taste neurons. Two RNAi lines (RNAi-1 from C. Lehner;
RNAi-2 from Bloomington, #50909) were used to knock down expression of O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) in the sweet taste neurons.
To uncouple taste deficits from fat accumulation, we compared mutants for perilipin2 (RKF610) and brummer (SGF529) (both gifts
from R. K€
uhnlein) to w1118CS flies.
METHOD DETAILS
Dietary manipulations
For each diet, the following compounds were mixed into standard cornmeal food (Bloomington Food B recipe) (0.58 calories per
gram) by melting, mixing, and pouring new vials as in Musselman et al. (2011) and Na et al. (2013).
Sugar diet20 = 20% Domino granulated sugar w/v (1.15 calories per gram)
Sugar diet / Sugar diet30 = 30% Domino granulated sugar w/v (1.41 calories per gram)
Lard = 10% lard w/v (1.42 calories per gram)
Sucralose = 0.02% sucralose w/v (this is the concentration found in diet soda and Dus et al. (2011).
FLIC diets were made with 5, 20, or 30% w/v D-sucrose (Fisher Scientific) dissolved in milliQ-filtered deionized water with 4 mg/L
MgCl2 (Sigma-Aldrich).
Age-matching of flies on the different diets occurred as in the table below:
Triacylglyceride (TAG) Assay
We assayed total TAGs normalized to total protein in whole flies (described in Tennessen et al. (2014). Following dietary manipulation,
male flies were CO2-anesthetized and flash frozen. Two flies per biological replicate were homogenized in lysis buffer (140 mM NaCl,
50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 0.1% Triton-X) containing protease inhibitor (Thermo Scientific) and centrifuged, and the supernatants were
frozen at �20�C. For total protein, supernatant and standards were reacted with protein reagent (Thermo Scientific Pierce BCA

natant and standards were reacted with TAG reagent (Stanbio Triglycerides LiquiColor Test) for 5 min at 37�C, and the absorbance of
500 nm measured by the Tecan Plate Reader.
Nile Red Staining
We stained abdominal fat body in male flies following dietary manipulation as described in Tennessen et al. (2014). Nile red stain stock
was 10% in DMSO, and the mounting solution diluted stock 1:1000 in 1xPBS with 30% glycerol. Fly abdomens were dissected in
1xPBS by removing intestines and other internal organs, then separating the abdomen and transecting it along the ventral side to
expose the subcuticular fat body. This was flattened and transferred to the Nile red mounting solution on slides with coverslips
for confocal imaging 30 minutes later. Images were acquired on an Olympus FV1200 with a 543-nm laser.
Proboscis Extension Response
On the seventh day of dietary manipulation, vials of 35-40 flies were fasted between ZT8 and ZT10 (ZT0 is 7 AM) in a vial with a
Kimwipe dampened with 2 mL of milliQ-filtered deionized (milliQ DI) water. 18-24 hours later, proboscis extension response (PER)
testing was performed as in Shiraiwa and Carlson (2007). Flies were anesthetized on ice then placed in the narrow end of a P200
pipette tip. The tip was cut such that the fly could be gently pushed (with the round end of a melted glass capillary tube) to the
end of the tip until the fly head showed through, with the legs still trapped within the tip. Once the fly was awake, it was presented
with milliQ water on the labellum and allowed to drink. Water and all tastants were delivered manually via a small solution-soaked
Kimwipe piece held in a clean pair of forceps. Sucrose solutions were dissolved in milliQ water and presented in order of descending
concentration. Each concentration presentation consisted of three successive touches to the proboscis, and the response to each
touch was scored. The touches were brief to ensure the fly did not drink any of the sucrose solution. After the three touches of a
sucrose solution, the fly was again allowed to drink water, before progressing to the next concentration presentation. Groups
of 7-10 flies were tested simultaneously.
Fly-to-Liquid-food Interaction Counter (FLIC)
We used the FLIC, described previously in Ro et al. (2014), to measure fly-to-food interactions as an estimate of feeding behavior over
many days without fasting or interruption. The FLIC consists of a Drosophila Feeding Monitor (DFM, made by the Pletcher laboratory)
which communicates fly-to-food interactions to computer software called FLICMonitor via a Master Control Unit (MCU, made by the
Pletcher laboratory). For FLIC experiments, flies were CO2-anesthetized and males were collected 1-3 days after eclosion. They were
then allowed to recover on Bloomington Food B for at least one day before starting the FLIC. For a single experiment, all fly ages were
within 3 days of each other. To load flies onto the FLIC, we briefly ice-anesthetized them and rapidly aspirated individual flies into
arenas with a single food well. Each DFM has 12 food wells in two rows of six, and each row of six wells is supplied by a single
food reservoir (cell culture flasks, Biofil). Once all flies for an experiment were loaded into the FLIC, we began the recording of their
food interactions.
A fly-to-food interaction on the FLIC occurs when the fly stands on the capacitance pad surrounding the food well and contacts the
food with its proboscis, as during feeding, or with its leg, as during tasting. The liquid food is a solution of sucrose (5% for normal diet
and 20% for high sugar diet) and 4 mg/L MgCl2 in milliQ water, and so can carry electrical current. The fly’s connection of the food to
the capacitance pad with its body closes a circuit and changes the voltage readout for that well. The signal intensity is sufficient to
distinguish tasting from food-intake-related contacts, a.k.a. ‘‘licks.’’ Signal threshold for licks was set to 40 units above calculated
baseline, while tasting occurred between 10 and 40. The MCU samples the voltage from all wells every 200 ms.
Long-term FLIC was run in an incubator with a 12-hour light cycle (ZT0 is 7 AM), at 25�C and 35%–50% humidity. (Humidity greater
than 60% can affect the baseline signal of the wells.) To correct sugar concentrations as water was lost to evaporation over many
days, we added a small volume of fresh milliQ water daily to each reservoir.
Optogenetic Stimulation for FLIC (optoFLIC)
We developed a closed-loop optoFLIC setup to time a pulsed light stimulation to a fly-to-food interaction in order to augment sweet
taste neuron activity in a behaviorally relevant way. This apparatus was a collaboration between the Dus and Pletcher labs. Stimu-
lation programs were written by SP and modified by CEM and KH, and can be found on Github. The FLIC lids were customized to
allow placement of one high-intensity LED (627nm SinkPAD-II, Luxeon) on the ceiling of each of the twelve single-well chambers.
Modified ‘‘optolids’’ were constructed from black polyoxymethylene (e.g., Delrin), which prohibited the leakage of light among
chambers. To control LED illumination, each modified lid was connected to its corresponding DFM through the existing expansion
port. LEDs were individually controlled cooperatively by each DFM and the FLIC Master Control Unit (MCU) using custom firmware.
Customization details, including firmware updates and electrical specifications, are available from the authors upon request.
OptoFLIC is technically similar to FLIC, but for a few exceptions: Unlike FLIC, optoFLIC requires a stimulation program for the MCU
to deliver to the optolids. For our data, the light pulse frequency (0 or 60 Hz) and duration of pulsing (100 ms) were chosen based on
our sensillar electrophysiology data and optimized to have no influence on feeding on control diet of 5% sucrose. OptoFLIC has a
range of parameters associated with near instantaneous LED illumination in response to the behavior of the animal. These param-
eters include: signal activation threshold to control illumination in response to the intensity of a feeding event; Illumination frequency
e3
Cell Reports 27, 1675–1685.e1–e7, May 7, 2019
 and pulse width to control the intensity of neuronal stimulation or inhibition; and duration of illumination following the termination of
feeding to maintain stimulation after the behavior has ended. For all experiments, signal threshold was set to 10; pulse width was set
to 8 ms; duration of illumination was set to 100 ms. Also, the delay from onset of feeding signal to onset of light stimulus was set to
0 ms; however, because the response rate of the system was tuned to ensure feeding signals were distinct from background, the
realtime delay in light onset was 200 ms after the initial feeding signal. Flies were maintained in the dark and fed on Bloomington corn-
meal food supplemented with 200 mm all-trans-retinal for 6 days prior to experiments for the proper functioning of Chrimson. At the
time of the optoFLIC experiments, the MCU had been upgraded to perform all the data collection independent of a computer and the
FLICMonitor software.
Taste Sensitivity Assay
Following dietary manipulation for 7 days, male flies were fasted for 22 hours (ZT9 until ZT7 next day) and then placed for 30 minutes
on 1% agar containing non-caloric L-glucose (CarboSynth) at the concentrations indicated and colored with 0.5% blue dye
(McCormick Culinary). Flies were kept at 25�C for the entirety of the experiment.
Sensillar Electrophysiology
Electrophysiological recordings were made at labellar sensilla of flies fed sugar or control diet for 1 or 7 days, following a protocol
similar to those described previously (Hiroi et al., 2002; Wang et al., 2016). Briefly, three to five L-type labellar bristles were recorded
on each fly. The recording electrode (tip diameter, 12–15 mm) was filled with designed experimental tastants. Each chosen L-type
bristle was stimulated by different concentrations of sucrose (in text) in 30mM tricholine citrate (TCC, Sigma-Aldrich, as electrolyte).
To avoid adaptation, each labellar taste sensilla was stimulated up to 4 s and allowed to recover for > 2 minutes before applying
another stimulus. Signals were acquired using an AxonClamp 900A amplifier and digitized with a 1400A D-A converter and AxoScope
10 software (Molecular Devices) at sampling rate of 10 kHz, filtered at 3 kHz. Electric signals were further amplified and filtered by a
second amplifier (CyberAmp 320, Axon Instrument, Inc., USA, with gain X 100, Lowpass filter 1600 Hz).
Metabolomics
Glucosamine-6-phosphate measurements were performed by Metabolon, Inc., using Ultrahigh Performance Liquid Chromatog-
raphy-Tandem Mass Spectroscopy. The measurements were conducted on samples of 100 heads from age-matched male flies
fed a control or high-sugar diet for 7 days. On the seventh day they were food-deprived for 24h, then refed 400 mM D-glucose
(‘‘fed’’) or 1% agar (‘‘fasted’’) for 1 hour. Animals were then flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and their heads collected with a sieve.
Calcium Imaging
The brains of awake, behaving male flies expressing GCaMP6s-Brp-mCherry (Kiragasi et al., 2017) in the Gr64f+ neurons were
prepared for imaging similarly to the preparation of LeDue et al. (2016), following 18-24 hours food deprivation. Briefly, each fly
was fixed to a custom-printed plastic slide with paraffin wax. The fly’s distal leg segments were removed to prevent tarsal interfer-
ence with labellar stimulation and response. The proboscis was wax-fixed in an extended position prevent retraction, minimizing
brain movement during imaging and aiding in accuracy of stimulus delivery. Each fly was tested with milliQ water before stimulating
with 30% sucrose dissolved in milliQ water. To image the SEZ, the well surrounding the head was filled with sugarless artificial
hemolymph solution (recipe in mM: 108 NaCl, 8.2 MgCl2, 4 NaHCO3, 1 NaH2PO4, 2 CaCl2, 5 KCl, 5 HEPES, pH 7.4) and the dorsal
cuticle between the eyes was removed by microdissection. Stimulus (a piece of Kimwipe soaked in tastant and held in a clean pair of
forceps) delivery to the proboscis was manual and timed to coincide with the 100th recording sample of each time series. Imaging
was done with an upright confocal microscope (Olympus, FluoView 1200 BX61WI) with a 20x water-immersion objective and laser
excitation at 488 and 543 nm. Images were recorded at 4 Hz (512 3 512 pixels). The plane of interest was kept to the most ventral
neuropil regions innervated by the Gr64f+ neurons.
RNA Extraction
The proboscis of 20 Gr5a-GAL4/UAS-OGT-RNAi flies were dissected into Trizol (Ambion) and homogenized with plastic pestles and
4-5 biological replicates collected over two days. RNA was extracted by acid phenol chloroform (Ambion), and precipitated by iso-
propanol with Glycoblue Coprecipitant (Invitrogen). RNA pellet was washed as needed with 75% ethanol. RNA was eluted in
nuclease free water and treated by DNase I, following manufacturer’s instructions (Turbo DNA-free DNA removal kit, Ambion).
Gr5a-GAL4 was used instead of Gr64f-GAL4 because the Gr64f transgene is a 10kb fragment that includes the coding regions
for the Gr64a-e genes, which increases the RNA abundance of these gustatory receptors and interferes with quantification of
possible changes in the abundance of these transcripts. For Gr5a-GAL4/UAS-OGT-RNAi experiment flies were first tested according
to their taste responses to 20, 10 and 5% sucrose using the proboscis extension response: Gr5a-GAL4/UAS-OGT-RNAi flies with
PER < 0.5 and Gr5a-GAL4/+ flies with PER > 0.5 were selected. For the SD and CD libraries, 200 probosces were dissected in
1xPBS and homogenized in Trizol (Ambion). RNA was extracted by chloroform followed by RNA clean up using RNeasy MinElute
Clean Up Kit (QIAGEN), and on column DNA digestion by DNase I (QIAGEN). The concentration and integrity of RNA was validated
using the Agilent Bio-analyzer system and Qubit RNA High Sensitivity Assay (Invitrogen). All steps were carried out in RNase free
conditions, and RNA was stored at �80C until library preparation.

 RNA-seq library preparation
Sequencing libraries were generated using the Ovation RNA-Seq System for Model Organisms (Nugen, 0350-32) for CD versus SD
experiments, and Ovation SoLo RNA-Seq System for Drosophila (Nugen, 0502-96) for Gr5a-GAL4>UAS-OGT-RNAi SD experiments.
All reactions included integrated HL-dsDNase treatment (ArcticZymes, Cat. #70800-201). All libraries were sequenced on the Illumina
NextSeq platform (paired read, High-output kit v2 75 cycles) using 38x37 bp paired end reads.
Proboscis Immunofluorescence
Probosces from Gr5a>nls-GFP flies were dissected in 1xPBS and fixed in 4% PFA, mounted in FocusClear (CelExplorer) on cover-
slips, and the cell bodies imaged using a FV1200 Olympus confocal with a 40x objective.
Quantitative RT-PCR
RNA was extracted from 10 heads per group with 4-5 biological replicates in the OGT experiment (Figure S7) and from 10 heads per
group with 3 biological replicates in the dilp2 and dilp5 experiment (Figure S2). Complementary DNA was synthesized by Superscript
III (Invitrogen) reverse transcriptase, and iScript Reverse Transcription Supermix for RT-qPCR (Bio-Rad Laboratories) with the addi-
tion of Ribolock RNase inhibitor (Thermo Fisher Scientific). qPCR reactions were carried out using Power SYBR Green PCR master
mix (Applied Biosystems) based on manufacturer’s instructions. Primers were added at a 2.5uM concentration. All reactions were run
on a 96-well plate on the StepOnePLus Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems) and quantifications were made relative to the
reference gene Ribosomal protein 49 (Rp49). The following primers were used:
QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Triacylglyceride (TAG) Assay
Data as presented are averages of the triglyceride:protein concentration ratio for each biological replicate per genotype and
dietary manipulation. Each experiment had 8 biological replicates per group, and each experiment was replicated at least once.
Figure panels and statistical tests were made in GraphPad Prism.
Nile Red Staining
Quantification of droplet surface area was performed using Imaris (Bitplane). Figure panels and statistical tests were made in
GraphPad Prism.
Proboscis Extension Response
The fly’s response to a sugar stimulus was scored as follows: a full extension given a score of 1, a partial extension a score of 0.5, and
no extension a score of 0. Each fly’s average response to a sucrose concentration was used to create the mean response per
genotype for that concentration.
Flies that neither kicked their legs nor responded to water or any of the sucrose solutions were removed from analysis as they had
likely been killed or compromised in the course of the prep. Figure panels and statistical tests were made in GraphPad Prism.
FLIC and optoFLIC
All analysis and visualization code for the FLIC is in R, and can be found on Github. Raw data collected by FLICMonitor was analyzed
in RStudio to calculate a moving baseline and to count licks. Once licks were calculated, we used RStudio code to sum the number
of licks in 30-minute bins. With this, we could calculate total daily licks or produce heatmaps of fly-to-food interaction intensity per
30-minute bin. We also calculated meal duration by finding feeding maxima for each fly, then acquiring the times of the last 30-minute
bin with zero or minimal licks before each maximum and the first 30-minute bin with zero or minimal licks after each maximum.

 Duration was then calculated as [(meal end) - (meal start)] per meal per fly. Meal size was calculated from meal duration as the
number of licks occurring between meal start and meal end. Per meal per day, these were averaged for genotype and concentration
of sucrose in FLIC food.
Figure panels and statistical tests were made in GraphPad Prism or in RStudio.
Taste Sensitivity Assay
Flies were scored for ingestion of the blue food by visual inspection of their abdomens. Figure panels and statistical tests were made
in GraphPad Prism.
Sensillar Electrophysiology
Data were analyzed using the Clampfit 10 software (Molecular Devices). Spikes between 0 and 2 s after initiation of stimuli were
counted as firing frequency evoked by the tastant. The mean value of spikes was calculated on 3-5 bristles recorded on each fly
as one statistical sample. Figure panels and statistical tests were made in GraphPad Prism.
Metabolomics
Raw data was extracted, peak-identified and QC processed using Metabolon’s hardware and software. Compounds were identified
by comparison to library entries of purified standards or recurrent unknown entities. Metabolon maintains a library based on authen-
ticated standards that contains the retention time/index (RI), mass to charge ratio (m/z), and chromatographic data (including MS/MS
spectral data) on all molecules present in the library. Furthermore, biochemical identifications are based on three criteria: retention
index within a narrow RI window of the proposed identification, accurate mass match to the library ± 10 ppm, and the MS/MS forward
and reverse scores between the experimental data and authentic standards. The MS/MS scores are based on a comparison of the
ions present in the experimental spectrum to the ions present in the library spectrum. Metabolite peaks were quantified using area-
under-the-curve and their amounts normalized by the total protein present in each sample. Figure panels and statistical tests were
made in GraphPad Prism.
Calcium Imaging
Areas of interest were drawn around the two neuropil regions apparent in the images taken. Data analysis was done in Microsoft
Excel by calculating DF/F0 for each channel, subtracting the mCherry signal (red) from the GCaMP6s signal (green) to correct for
movement, and then calculating the area under the curve after sugar stimulation. Figure panels and statistical tests were made in
GraphPad Prism.
Analysis of high throughput RNA sequencing
Because we observed high rates of likely PCR duplicates among the reads for most samples, the raw reads were de-duplicated using
ParDRe (Gonzalez-Dominguez and Schmidt, 2016), allowing one mismatch and using an 18 bp prefix. Testing on internal controls
using the ERCC spike-in mix showed that de-duplication improved the correlation of transcript abundances with known relative
values (data not shown). Surviving reads that had any recognizable fragment of the Nugen sequencing adaptor were removed using
cutadapt 1.8.1 (Martin, 2011) and low quality ends were removed using Trimmomatic 0.22 (Bolger et al., 2014) to remove all terminal
bases with quality scores below three, and then requiring that for surviving bases, their average quality score over a 4 bp window was
at least 15. Reads with fewer than 20 surviving bases were subsequently dropped. Preprocessed reads were aligned to the
Drosophila melanogaster Flybase release 6.08 transcriptome, augmented with Gal4 and EGFP transcript sequences, using kallisto
0.43.0 (Bray et al., 2016) with a k-mer size of 21 and 200 bootstrap replicates. We used sleuth (Pimentel et al., 2017) for further post-
processing of the RNA-seq data; in particular, all significance tests for differential expression on RNA-seq data use p values or
q-values (as noted) from sleuth for a Wald test on the coefficient distinguishing the groups in question. While we initially obtained
three biological replicates for each of the CD and SD cases, we noted that one replicate from each condition was a substantial outlier
from all other points (across both conditions) based on the Jensen-Shannon divergence between samples; we excluded that outlier
pair from all described analysis. Similar pruning was applied to other sample sets. The final numbers of biological replicates for
analyzed sequencing data are given in Table S1. For the pathway analysis in Figure S7, we used iPAGE (Goodarzi et al., 2009) to
find gene ontology (GO) terms showing significant mutual information with the profile of fitted gene-level effect sizes from sleuth.
Note that due to the several tests incorporated into the iPAGE pipeline (many of which are not shown), the overall false discovery
rate of the procedure on expression profiles has been empirically been shown to be less than 0.05 (Goodarzi et al., 2009). To classify
genes for the Venn diagram in Figure 7D, we first selected only the set of genes showing significant changes in expression
between CD and SD (q < 0.1), and then conditioning on membership in that set, calculated FDR-corrected p values for the
significance of changes in transcript level for the same genes between the Gr5a-GAL4/UAS-OGT RNAi flies and the corresponding
Gr5a-GAL4/+ controls, (using a threshold of an FDR-corrected p value < 0.2). Genes showing significant expression changes in both
experiments were classified based on the signs of the observed log fold changes. For the pathway analysis shown in Figure 7E, we
used iPAGE (Goodarzi et al., 2009) to identify GO terms showing significant mutual information with the status of genes as being

 in any of the oppositely-regulated categories of Figure 7D, or among the set of all other genes (a ‘background’ set that is not
shown). iPAGE calculations used GO term annotations from the dmel_r6.08 Flybase release. Data was uploaded to GEO as submis-
sion # GSE113159.
qPCR analysis
Primer efficiency was calculated by serial dilution of primers and only primers with efficiencies greater than 90% were selected.
Relative fold changes in transcript abundance was determined with the Livak method using the Ribosomal protein 49 (Rp49) tran-
script as a housekeeping control.
Statistics
Statistical tests, sample size, and p or q values are listed in each figure legend. Data were evaluated for normality and appropriate
statistical tests applied if data were not normally distributed. All data are shown as Mean ± SEM, **** p < 0.0001, *** p < 0.001, ** p <
0.01, * p < 0.05 for all figures unless otherwise indicated.
