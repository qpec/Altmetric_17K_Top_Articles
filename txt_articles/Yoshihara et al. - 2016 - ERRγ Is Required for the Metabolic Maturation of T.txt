In Brief
Yoshihara et al. report that the postnatal
maturation of pancreatic b cells
necessary for maximal glucose-
stimulated insulin secretion is
coordinated by the estrogen-related
receptor g (ERRg). ERRg drives a
transcriptional program promoting
mitochondrial oxidative metabolism, and
its expression in iPSC-derived b-like cells
generates functional b cells in vitro.

SUMMARY
Pancreatic b cells undergo postnatal maturation to
achieve maximal glucose-responsive insulin secre-
tion, an energy intensive process. We identify estro-
gen-related receptor g (ERRg) expression as a hall-
mark of adult, but not neonatal b cells. Postnatal
induction of ERRg drives a transcriptional network
activating mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation,
the electron transport chain, and ATP production
needed to drive glucose-responsive insulin secre-
tion. Mice deficient in b cell-specific ERRg expres-
sion are glucose intolerant and fail to secrete insulin
in response to a glucose challenge. Notably, forced
expression of ERRg in iPSC-derived b-like cells
enables glucose-responsive secretion of human in-
sulin in vitro, obviating in vivo maturation to achieve
functionality. Moreover, these cells rapidly rescue
diabetes when transplanted into b cell-deficient
mice. These results identify a key role for ERRg in b
cell metabolic maturation, and offer a reproducible,
quantifiable, and scalable approach for in vitro gen-
eration of functional human b cell therapeutics.
INTRODUCTION
In healthy individuals, pancreatic b cells secrete insulin in
response to nutrients such as glucose, amino acids, and free
fatty acids to regulate blood glucose levels and lipid metabolism
(Prentki et al., 2013), whereas b cell failure or impaired function is
associated with both type 1 and type 2 diabetes (Ashcroft and
Rorsman, 2012). The continuing challenges in treating diabetes
placed the development of transplantable b cells as one of the
central goals of stem cell therapy. While human embryonic and
pluripotent stem cells (hESCs and hPSCs) offer this potential, it
has been difficult to realize this therapeutic promise. The recent
descriptions of embryonic stem-derived b-like cells reflect both
the progress and ongoing challenges in achieving functionally
mature b cells in vitro (Pagliuca et al., 2014; Rezania et al.,
2014). Interestingly, transplantation of these pre-functional cells
into mice results in a progressive in vivo maturation, presumably
facilitated by the complex internal milieu reflecting a process that
may be too complex to achieve in cell culture.
b cells are known to facilitate glucose-stimulated insulin secre-
tion (GSIS) through increased mitochondrial oxidative ATP pro-
duction (Prentki et al., 2013; Supale et al., 2012). Whereas the
cellular components required for GSIS are well established, the
key transcriptional networks that regulate b cell metabolism
and insulin secretion remain poorly understood.
Nuclear receptors are ligand-dependent transcription factors
that play central roles in controlling development, growth, and
metabolism (Evans and Mangelsdorf, 2014). Estrogen-related
receptors (ERRs) are orphan nuclear receptors represented
by three paralogs in mammals, ERRa (NR3B1, Esrra), ERRb
(NR3B2, Esrrb), and ERRg (NR3B3, Esrrg). ERRb is known to
play an essential role in embryonic stem cell maintenance (Feng
et al., 2009;Festuccia et al., 2012) whereas ERRa and ERRg regu-
late oxidative pathways such as the tricarboxylic acid cycle, the
electron transport complex (ETC), and oxidative phosphorylation
(OxPhos). Notably, genetic studies in mice have revealed distinct
functions for ERRa and ERRg (Alaynick et al., 2007; Dufour
et al., 2007; Luo et al., 2003). While whole body ERRa knockout
(ERRaKO) mice are developmentally normal, they are lean and
resistant to high fat diet-induced obesity (Luo et al., 2003). In
contrast, whole body ERRg knockout (ERRgKO) mice have signif-
icant developmental abnormalities and marked postnatal lethality
attributed to defects in energy utilization, severely limiting their
experimental utility (Alaynick et al., 2007).
Here we report that ERRg is a master regulator of b cell matu-
ration in vivo and that this function can be recapitulated in the
in vitro setting. Accordingly, mice lacking ERRg specifically in
pancreatic b cells (bERRgKO mice) are glucose intolerant
due to impaired insulin secretion. Reciprocally, in vitro expres-
sion of ERRg in human iPSC-derived b-like cells yields func-
tional and transplantable glucose-responsive cells capable of
restoring glucose homeostasis in type 1 diabetic mice. These
studies reveal that functional, transplantable b cells can be
generated and quantified in vitro without the need for kidney
capsule maturation in patients.

 RESULTS
Postnatal Islets Acquire Oxidative Features
b cells are known to functionally mature postnatally, including
acquiring the ability to robustly secrete insulin in response to
high glucose (Bliss and Sharp, 1992; Grill et al., 1981; Lavine
et al., 1971). Consistent with an immature phenotype, islets
isolated from 2-week-old neonatal mice are unable to secrete
insulin appropriately in response to a high glucose challenge
(Figure 1A). To identify critical pathways required for GSIS, we
compared the transcriptomes of isolated islets during postnatal
maturation. Consistent with b cell terminal differentiation being
essentially completed postnatally, and the fact that adult b cells
are formed by self-duplication rather than stem-cell differentia-
tion (Dor et al., 2004), the expression of genes known to regulate
pancreatic endocrine development in rodents and humans
are largely unchanged (Conrad et al., 2014) (Figure S1A;
Table S1A). Whereas increased Pdx1, MafA, and Nkx6-1, and

 decreased MafB expression are observed with maturation, in
agreement with these genes being required for adult b cell func-
tion (Conrad et al., 2014), the expression of the majority of tran-
scription factors implicated in b cell development is largely un-
changed (Figure S1A; Table S1A). Functional analyses of the
transcriptomes revealed that genes involved in cell proliferation
are downregulated during islet maturation, including known pos-
itive b cell proliferation regulators Pdgfra, Pdgfrb, Pdgfb, and
Fgfr1, in line with the observed decline in clonal b cell expansion
in adult islets (Figure 1B; Figures S1B and S1C; Table S1B) (Chen
et al., 2011; Dor et al., 2004; Teta et al., 2005). In contrast, upre-
gulated genes are associated with metabolic pathways, partic-
ularly glucose metabolism and ATP biosynthesis pathways,
including ETC, OxPhos, and ion channel-related exocytosis.
Given the high mitochondrial activity of adult b cells, we hypoth-
esized that this induction of metabolic genes may be critical
for acquiring proper GSIS function during maturation. Consis-
tent with this hypothesis, mitochondrial genes known to regu-
late GSIS, including malate dehydrogenase (Mdh1), pyruvate
carboxylase (Pcx), and components of OxPhos including
Cox6a2, Ndufa4, and Ndufs2, are more highly expressed,
whereas lactate dehydrogenase (Ldha), a suppressor of GSIS,
has reduced expression in adult compared to neonatal b cells
(Xu et al., 2008) (Zhao and Rutter, 1998) (Figures 1C and 1F;
Table S1B). These results suggest that a key metabolic transition
may occur in islet b cells during postnatal functional maturation.
Of particular note, expression of Errg, a known mitochondrial
gene regulator, is progressively induced during islet maturation
(Figures 1C and 1D). This induction of Errg expression is similarly
observed in primary b cells isolated from mouse insulin-GFP
(MIP-GFP) mice, where Errg expression is �5-fold higher in adult
compared to neonatal b cells (Figures S1D–S1F). These findings,
combined with the predominant expression of Errg in endocrine
islets compared to exocrine cells, as evidenced by the positive
staining of islets in ERRg-LacZ knockin mice (Alaynick et al.,
2007) and the enrichment of Errgexpression in islets compared
to whole pancreas (Figure 1E; Figure S1G), are suggestive of a
specific role for Errg in orchestrating a metabolic transition in
endocrine cells required for GSIS.
ERRg Is Required for Glucose-Stimulated Insulin
Secretion
To investigate the proposed role of ERRg in the functional matu-
ration of pancreatic b cells, we generated b cell-specific Errg
knockout (bERRgKO) mice by crossing Errgfl/fl mice with rat
insulin 2 promoter (RIP)-Cre mice. bERRgKO mice are born at
the expected Mendelian frequency and exhibit normal body
weights, ad lib fed glucose levels, and life expectancies (Figures
S2A–S2C). The RIP-Cre recombinase selectively decreased
Errgexpression by 80% in bERRgKO compared to wild-type
Errgfl/fl islets without significantly affecting hypothalamic Errg
expression, in agreement with recent similar reports (Tang
et al., 2013) (Figure S2A). However, bERRgKO mice were
glucose intolerant compared to Errgfl/fl (WT) and RIP-Cre (WT
[RIP-Cre]) cohorts, as determined by glucose tolerance tests
(GTTs) (Figure 2A; Figures S2D and S2E). Although no significant
differences in insulin sensitivity are seen, bERRgKO mice fail to
increase insulin secretion in response to a glucose challenge
(Figures 2C and 2D). Notably, this bERRgKO phenotype is exag-
gerated by metabolic stress after weaning. bERRgKO mice fed
a high fat-high sucrose diet for 4 weeks from 4 weeks of age
displayed more pronounced glucose intolerance and defects in
insulin secretion, without any significant change in insulin sensi-
tivity (Figures 2B, 2C, and 2E).
The inability of bERRgKO mice to secrete insulin in response
to a glucose challenge is phenocopied in both inducible b cell-
specific deletion (bERRgKO ER+Tam) and pancreatic-specific
ERRgKO (PERRgKO) mouse models. bERRgKO ER mice treated
with tamoxifen (7 days sequential intraperitoneal [i.p.] injection)
show a 75% reduction in islet Errg expression and exhibit
glucose intolerance similar to that observed in the develop-
mental bERRgKO mice (Figures S2F and S2G). Furthermore,
mice lacking Errg in the entire pancreas generated by crossing
Errgfl/fl mice with PDX1-Cre mice (PERRgKO mice) display
impaired glucose tolerance and reduced insulin secretion
compared to WT mice (Figures S2H–S2K). Collectively, these re-
sults suggest that islet Errg expression is essential for proper
GSIS function and whole body glucose homeostasis when chal-
lenged with elevated blood glucose levels.
Morphologically, islets isolated from bERRgKO mice main-
tained on a normal chow diet are indistinguishable from control
islets, based on hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining and
immunohistochemical analysis (Figure S3A, top). However,
when stressed by a high fat diet (HFD), significant increases in
b cell mass, insulin content, and islet size are seen in bERRgKO
compared to control islets (Figures S3A–S3G). These changes
suggest that the glucose-intolerant phenotype of bERRgKO
mice is due to a defect in GSIS rather than b cell mass reduction.
To explore this notion, we evaluated the effect of transient Errg
deletion ex vivo on GSIS. Adenoviral-induced Cre-recombina-
tion in Errgfl/fl (Ad-ERRgKO) islets reduces Errg expression by
�75% compared to control adenovirus EGFP-Errgfl/fl (Ad-Con-
trol) islets without affecting insulin2 expression (Figure 2F).
Notably, the ability of Ad-ERRgKO islets to secrete insulin in
response to a glucose challenge is almost totally abrogated
ex vivo, while the sensitivity to KCl is largely intact (Figure 2G).
Furthermore, loss of Errg selectively in b cells (bERRgKO mice)
or the entire pancreas (PERRgKO mice) reduces islet insulin
secretion in response to nutrients such as glucose, L-leucine,
and L-glutamine (Figures S3H and S3I, respectively). Because
ERRg regulates mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and
metabolism in heart muscle (Alaynick et al., 2007; Dufour et al.,
2007), skeletal muscle (Narkar et al., 2011), and brain (Pei
et al., 2015), we asked whether ERRg is required for mitochon-
drial function in islets. Ad-Control islets respond robustly with a
1.5-fold increase in their oxygen consumption rate (OCR) when
stimulated with 20 mM glucose. In contrast, Ad-ERRgKO islets
fail to increase their OCR in response to the glucose challenge
(Figure 2H). Consistent with these results, Errg knockdown in
the rat clonal b cell line INS-1 similarly reduces OCR, cellular
ATP production, and GSIS function in response to a glucose
challenge (Figures S3J–S3M). These results suggest that ERRg
regulation of b cell energy metabolism is required for GSIS.
ERRg Is Required for b Cell Metabolic Maturation
Because mitochondrial function and morphology are tightly
correlated (Anello et al., 2005; Hackenbrock, 1966), we investi-
gated whether structural changes were detectable in bERRgKO
624

 b cell mitochondria. Electron microscopy revealed that the insu-
lin and proinsulin granules, and the overall mitochondrial number
are not affected by Errg deletion (Figures 3A and 3B). However,
mitochondrial swelling leading to a significant increase in mito-
chondrial volume and disrupted cristae structure are seen in
the Errg-deficient b cells, hallmarks of functionally defective
mitochondria in b cells (Figures 3A and 3C).
To understand the molecular role of ERRg in b cell function, we
determined the transcriptional consequences of Errg deletion. In
the developmentally deleted bERRgKO islets, RNA sequencing
(RNA-seq) revealed that the expression of 4,189 genes was
altered, with almost equal numbers of genes down- and upregu-
lated (2,008 and 2,181 genes, respectively; false discovery rate
[FDR] <0.01, fold change [FC] >1.5). A similar comparison in
the transiently deleted Ad-ERRgKO islets by microarray analysis
identified 2,205 genes with altered expression, again with similar
numbers of genes down- and upregulated (1,207 and 998 genes,
respectively; FDR <0.01, FC >1.25). Because defects in GSIS are

 observed ex vivo in both bERRgKO islets (Figure S3H) and Ad-
ERRgKO islets (Figure 2G), we performed gene ontology (GO)
analysis on the common, differentially expressed genes (232
down- and 239 upregulated genes) to identify global cellular
processes affected by Errg deletion (Figure S4A; Table S1C).
Consistent with the diabetic phenotype, ERRg-regulated genes
are associated with processes critical for b cell function including
ATP biosynthesis, cation transport, oxidative phosphorylation,
electron transport, and secretion (Figure 3D). Furthermore, motif
analyses of promoter regions identified ERR response elements
in more than half of these differentially expressed genes (62.1%
of down- and 64.6% of upregulated genes), suggesting direct
regulation by ERRg (Figure S4B). In support of this notion, con-
ventional chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays per-
formed in the mouse insulinoma cell line MIN-6 confirmed the
direct binding of ERRg to the promoter regions of Atp2a2 and
Mdh1 (Figure S4C). The expression changes of selected genes
relevant to metabolic pathways (Mdh1, Cox6a2, Atp2a2, Ndufs2,
and Atp6v0a2) were confirmed by qPCR analysis in both
bERRgKO and PERRgKO islets (Figure 3E, left and right images,
respectively). These results suggest that ERRg is a global regu-
lator of ATP biosynthesis and metabolic genes in islet b cells.

 To further clarify the role of ERRg in the functional maturation
of b cells, we compared the postnatal transcriptional changes
in islets with those induced by ERRg deletion. Notably, loss of
ERRg abrogates a large number of the transcriptional changes
associated with postnatal b cell maturation (Figures 3F and
S4D). Specifically, the changes in expression of 74 genes upre-
gulated, and 35 genes downregulated during maturation are lost
in bERRgKO islets (Figure 3F). These dysregulated genes include
genes involved in energy production (ATP biosynthesis, oxida-
tive phosphorylation, and ETC) and secretory/exocytosis path-
ways (Figure 3G). Collectively, these results suggest that ERRg
is not only required to maintain mitochondrial function in func-
tionally mature b cells, but also directly orchestrates many of
the transcriptional changes that drive the postnatal maturation
of these cells.
ERRg Drives the Maturation of Synthetic b-like Cells
Generation of transplantable human b cells from pluripotent
stem cells is a major goal of stem cell therapeutics. However,
current iPSC-derived b-like cells resemble fetal cells in their
inability to secrete insulin in response to a glucose challenge
(Hrvatin et al., 2014; Pagliuca and Melton, 2013). Based on our
proposed regulatory role for ERRg in enhancing oxidative meta-
bolism during b cell maturation, and the enrichment of ERRg
expression in adult compared to fetal human b cells (GEO:
GSE56130), we asked whether overexpression of ERRg could
drive a metabolic maturation and thereby GSIS capability in
human iPSC-derived b-like cells. To address this question, we
initially optimized the differentiation protocol for producing insu-
lin-positive b-like cells from human iPSCs, using a human insulin
promoter driven-GFP reporter for screening and isolation
(Blum et al., 2012; D’Amour et al., 2006; Kroon et al., 2008; Ku-
nisada et al., 2012; Schulz et al., 2012; Sneddon et al., 2012;
Xie et al., 2013). In our optimized protocol, insulin-positive cells
are generated from iPSCs, derived from a human endothelial
cell line HUVEC, 18–21 days after initiation of differentiation (Fig-
ures 4A–4C). Expression profiling during iPSC differentiation
confirmed the generation of b-like insulin-producing cells
(defined as ibL cells). Specifically, expression of the pluripotent
marker NANOG is lost upon initiation of differentiation, whereas
the terminal b cell differentiation marker, insulin, appears 18–
21 days after initiation of differentiation. The definitive endoderm
marker SOX17 and the pancreatic progenitor marker HNF1b
are transiently increased around day 5, and days 7–15 respec-
tively (Figure S5A). Furthermore, the expression of additional
b cell markers including PDX1, MAFA, NKX6-1, NEUROD1,
GCK, and VAMP2 are strongly induced at day 21 (Figure S5A).
This optimized differentiation protocol reproducibly generates
insulin-positive, PDX1-positive, glucagon-negative b-like cells
with significant expression of NKX6-1 and MAFA (defined here
as ibL cells, Figures S5A–S5G). Moreover, while ibL cells fail to
secrete c-peptide in response to a glucose challenge, they are
responsive to direct cellular depolarization-mediated insulin
secretion by KCl (Figure S5H).
Given the role of ERRg in endogenous b cell metabolic matu-
ration, we asked whether overexpression of ERRg could rescue
GSIS function in iPSC-derived b-like cells. To address this ques-
tion, we infected day 22–25 iPSC-derived b-like cells with an
adenoviral ERRg (Ad-ERRg) or control (Ad-GFP) vector and per-
formed gene expression and functional analyses at days 25–30.
Given the widespread use of insulin in culture media, we used
human c-peptide levels as a surrogate measure of b-like cell-
derived insulin. We found that Ad-ERRg infection successfully
restores ERRgexpression in iPSC-derived b-like cells, but
does not significantly affect their intracellular c-peptide content
(Figure 4D, left; Figure S5I). Encouragingly, Ad-ERRg infection
does significantly increase the c-peptide concentration in the
culture media (Figure 4D, right). We next examined the GSIS abil-
ity of Ad-ERRg infected iPSC-derived b-like cells. Control Ad-
EGFP infected iPSC-derived b-like cells (defined as ibLGFP cells)
are not able to secrete c-peptide in response to a glucose chal-
lenge. Remarkably, Ad-ERRg-infected iPSC-derived b-like cells
(defined as ibeta cells) demonstrate enhanced c-peptide secre-
tion in response to a glucose challenge, similar to that recorded
for isolated human islets, in the absence of an increase in
maximum exocytosis-secretion capacity measured by KCl stim-
ulated insulin secretion (Figure 4E; Figure S5J). Transcriptomic
analyses identified increases in ibeta cells of genes associated
with the generation of precursor metabolites, oxidation reduc-
tion, ETC),oxidative phosphorylation, and mitochondrial orga-
nization, and decreases in genes associated with cell cycle
(Figures 4F and 4G; Table S2). Interestingly, directed ERRg
expression alters the expression profile of metabolic pathway
genes in ibeta cells toward that seen in human islets, without sig-
nificant increases in the expression of KATP channel/secretion
pathway or b cell lineage-specific genes (Figures 5A–5C; Figures
S5K and S6A). Furthermore, ERRg overexpression improves the
cristae structure, as well as the respiration function of mitochon-
dria in ibeta cells (Figures 5D and 5E). These results describe
the generation of a synthetic glucose-responsive b-like cell
from iPSCs, and support our hypothesis that ERRg-regulated
mitochondrial metabolic pathways are required for GSIS.
The ultimate goal is to produce transplantable b cells capable
of restoring glucose homeostasis in the setting of diabetes. To
determine whether our ibeta cells function in vivo, we utilized a
Streptozocin (STZ)-induced diabetic NOD-SCID mouse model.
Blood glucose levels of NOD-SCID mice treated with STZ
(180 mg/kg i.p. injection) were monitored daily to confirm hyper-
glycemia (blood glucose levels >300 mg/dl). 12 days after STZ
injection, 10 million iPSC-derived b-like cells infected with Ad-
ERRg (ibeta cells) or Ad-GFP (ibLGFP cells) were transplanted
into the kidney capsule (Figure S6B). Human islets and mouse is-
lets were similarly transplanted as positive controls. Remarkably,
the blood glucose levels of mice that received the ibeta cells
began to normalize within days of transplantation, similar to
those receiving functional human or mouse islets (Figures 6A
and 6B). Furthermore, transplanted ibeta cells controlled blood
glucose levels in recipient mice chronically (56 days; Figures
6B and S6C) and insulin-positive cells were detected in the kid-
ney 2 months after transplantation (Figure S7). Importantly, in
approximately 50% of chronically treated ibeta cell recipient
mice, blood glucose levels are restored to non-diabetic levels
(<250 mg/dl) concomitant with a glucose-responsive phenotype,
as demonstrated by glucose tolerance tests, similar to mice that
received human islet transplantation (Figure 6C). Additionally,
pronounced improvements in the circadian regulation of glucose
and lipid metabolism, which is tightly controlled by insulin, are
observed in the chronically treated ibeta cell recipient mice

 with normalized blood glucose levels (increased nighttime respi-
ratory exchange ratio [RER] consistent with improved glucose
utilization), and are accompanied by increased nighttime activity
(Figure 6D). These results demonstrate that increased oxidative
mitochondrial metabolism driven by ERRg expression may be
exploited to potentiate GSIS function in human iPSC-derived
b-like cells.
DISCUSSION
Fetal development occurs under conditions of low oxygen ten-
sion and steady maternal glucose such that physiologic systems
including the pancreas are functionally poised in the prenatal
state. Postnatally, oxidative metabolism becomes dominant
and intermittent feeding exposes the pancreas to dramatic

 changes in blood glucose. In particular, weaning has been re-
ported to trigger a b cell maturation step characterized by
enhanced glucose-stimulated oxidative phosphorylation and in-
sulin secretion (Jacovetti et al., 2015; Stolovich-Rain et al., 2015).
We demonstrate a direct linkage between the expression of the
orphan nuclear receptor ERRg and pre- and postnatal b cell
metabolism. Based on selective expression in adult, but not
fetal/neonatal b cells, our findings suggest that ERRg is a key
driver of the oxidative metabolic gene network in mature b cells,
and that its postnatal induction orchestrates the metabolic matu-
ration of b cells. Based on these findings, we posited that
reversing the deficiency of ERRg expression in iPSC-derived
b-like cells may improve their ability to secrete insulin in
response to a glucose challenge. Consistent with this notion,
we show that targeted ERRg expression in iPSC-derived b-like
(ibeta) cells triggers a metabolic transformation that facilitates
GSIS. Whereas significant variability and heterogeneity is
observed in the human ibeta preparations (which we attribute
to technical differences in ERRg expression and differentiation
conditions, e.g., Figure S5D and Table S6), transplantation of
these cells into the kidney capsule not only restores glucose
homeostasis in STZ-induced type 1 diabetic mice, but re-estab-
lishes circadian rhythmicity to metabolic substrate usage, a pro-
cess regulated by b cells.
As a known activator of mitochondrial function including
oxidative metabolism, this dependence on ERRg expression
suggests that very high cellular energy levels are needed to
achieve and maintain glucose responsiveness (Dhawan et al.,

 2015; Jacovetti et al., 2015; Stolovich-Rain et al., 2015). Remark-
ably, as a single gene, ERRg appears sufficient to induce a gene
network necessary to overcome this metabolic roadblock in
iPSC-derived b-like cells. In contrast, b cell-specific ERRg-defi-
cient mice are glucose intolerant and fail to appropriately secrete
insulin in response to a glucose challenge. Thus, genome-
orchestrated metabolic maturation seems to be a critical step
in both the metabolic maturation of endogenous b cells in vivo
and engineered b-like cells in vitro.
Poor glucose management is associated with long-term dia-
betic consequences including diabetic retinopathy, nephropa-
thy, and neuropathy. Although long-acting insulin formulations
and programmable delivery pumps provide durable therapeutic
utility, they fail to fully replicate the glucose-responsiveness of
pancreatic b cells. Human islet transplantations offer superior
glucose management, but require immunosuppressive drug reg-
imens and are limited by the availability and viability of the trans-
planted cells. Although insulin independence can be achieved
via islet transplantation, more than 50% of patients who received
allotransplants and virtually all who received autotransplants are
back on insulin therapy after 5 years. In both situations, trans-
plantation of a larger mass of islets may alleviate some of the
limitations. Patient-specific iPSC-derived b cells produced in un-
limited supplies and potentially encapsulated in the newly devel-
oped alginate hydrogels (Vegas et al., 2016a, 2016b) could
resolve many of these concerns and is one of the major goals
of stem cell replacement therapy.
Despite recent advances, including generating functional
b-like cells from hESCs (Pagliuca et al., 2014; Rezania et al.,
2014) and the in vivo functional maturation of in vitro differenti-

ated pancreatic progenitor cells (Kroon
et al., 2008), the underlying mechanisms
of b cell functional maturation remain
poorly understood. Whereas dynamic
chromatin remodeling (Xie et al., 2013)
and sympathetic innervation stimuli (Bor-
den et al., 2013) are implicated, our finding that ERRg coordi-
nates a transcriptional program regulating increased oxidative
metabolism provides novel mechanistic insight into the func-
tional limitations preventing b cell maturation (Figure 7). In sup-
port of these observations, genetic and epidemiology studies
have independently implicated ERRg as a risk factor in the devel-
opment of diabetes (Chuang et al., 2008; Rampersaud et al.,
2007; Tennessen and Thummel, 2011), although its functional
relevance was not understood.
Our work suggests that the single gene (ERRg) can drive
metabolic maturation in vitro. This has practical advantages for
dissecting the cellular events underlying this postnatal matura-
tion process. Hopefully, the pivotal role of ERRg in generating
glucose-responsive b cells will accelerate the development of pa-
tient-specific glucose-sensitive insulin-producing b cells by over-
coming a long-standing conceptual and molecular roadblock.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Generation and Maintenance of Mouse Lines
b cell-specific ERRg-knockout mice (bERRgKO) were generated by crossing
ERRgfl/fl (generously provided by Johan Auwerx) and RIP-Cre (B6N.Cg-
Tg(Ins2-cre)25Mgn/J) mice on a pure C57BL/6J genetic background. Tamox-
ifen-inducible b cell-specific ERRg-knockout mice were generated by crossing
ERRg fl/fl and RIP-CreER (STOCK Tg [Ins2-cre/Esr1]1Dam/J) mice. Pancreas-
specific ERRg-knockout mice (PERRgKO) were generated by crossing
ERRgfl/fl and PDX1-Cre (B6.FVB-Tg[PDX1-cre]6Tuv/J). Insulin promoter GFP
(MIP-GFP) mice (Tg[Ins1-EGFP]1Hara) and all above Cre lines were purchased
from Jackson Laboratory. The ERRg-LacZ knockin mice were described
previously (Alaynick et al., 2007). Animals were maintained in a specific
pathogen-free animal facility on a 12-hr light-dark cycle at an ambient temper-
ature of 23�C. Water and food were provided ad lib. All animal experiments
630
Cell Metabolism 23, 622–634, April 12, 2016
 used age-matched male mice. All procedures involving animals were per-
formed in accordance with protocols approved by the IACUC and Animal
Resources Department of the Salk Institute for Biological Studies. Details on
tamoxifen-inducible mice are described in the Supplemental Experimental
Procedures.
Intraperitoneal Glucose or Insulin Tolerance Tests
Intraperitoneal GTTs were performed on overnight fasted mice. Blood glucose
values were assessed before and at 15, 30, 60, and 120 min after i.p. admin-
istration of 2 g/kg of glucose using glucose PILOT. Serum insulin levels were
assessed before and at 5, 15, and 30 min after the i.p. administration of
glucose using a rat/mouse Insulin ELISA kit (Millipore). IP-ITT assays were per-
formed on mice after a 6 hr fast with an injection of 0.75 U/kg of insulin (Humalin
R, Eli Lilly).
Isolation of Pancreatic Islets
Mouse pancreatic islets were isolated as previously described (Yoshihara
et al., 2010) with slight modification. Briefly, 0.5 mg/ml collagenase P (Roche
REF11213873001, diluted in HBSS buffer, GIBCO, 14170-112) was injected
through the common bile duct, and the perfused pancreas dissected and incu-
bated at 37�C for 21 min. Digested exocrine cells and intact islets were sepa-
rated via centrifugation (900 3 g for 15 min) over Histopaque-1077 (Sigma,
H8889), and intact islets were manually selected. Human islets were provided
by the Integrated Islets Distribution Program under an approved protocol.
Additional information on human islets is provided in Table S3.
Insulin Secretion Assay
Insulin release from intact islets was monitored using batch incubation
methods (Yoshihara et al., 2010). Overnight-cultured isolated pancreatic islets
(RPMI-1640 supplemented with 10% [v/v] fetal bovine serum and 1% [v/v]
antibiotic-antimycotic [GIBCO]) were pre-cultured at 37�C for 30 min (Krebs-
Ringer bicarbonate buffer [KRBB] containing 129.4 mM NaCl, 3.7 mM KCl,
2.7 mM CaCl2, 1.3 mM KH2PO4, 1.3 mM MgSO4, and 24.8 mM NaHCO3 (equil-
ibrated with 5% CO2, 95% O2 [pH 7.4]), 10 mM HEPES, and 0.2% (v/v) BSA
(fraction V, Sigma) (KRBH) with 3 mM glucose. Pancreatic islets were then
incubated in KRBH buffer (500 ml/ten islets) with 3 mM or 20 mM glucose to
determine insulin secretion levels. After 30 min, islets were pelleted by centri-
fugation and insulin levels determined by ELISA (rat/mouse insulin ELISA
KIT [Millipore, EZRMI-13K] for mouse and human islets, respectively). For
hiPSC-derived cells, cells (1 3 106 cells/well in 24 wells) were pre-cultured
in 3 mM glucose KRBH buffer (500 ml/well). The cells were then incubated in
KRBH buffer (200 ml/well) with 3 mM or 20 mM glucose to determine c-peptide
secretion levels as an indicator of insulin secretion levels. After 30 min, the
cells were pelleted by centrifugation and c-peptide levels were determined
in the supernatant using a human c-peptide ELISA kit (Millipore, EZHCP-
20K). Details for rat INS-1 cell culture, transfection, and insulin secretion assay
are in the Supplemental Experimental Procedures.
Chromatin Immunoprecipitation
Chromatin was prepared from mouse insulinoma, MIN-6 cells. Briefly, MIN-6
cells were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min, followed by the
addition of glycine at 125 mM. Chromatin was sheared by enzymes (CHIP IT
Express Kit, Active Motif, 53009) and immunoprecipitated with 2 mg anti-H3,
control mouse IgG, or anti-ERRg antibodies. ChIP-qPCR primers are listed
in Table S4.
Generation of Reporter hiPSC
Human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) derived from HUVECs
were obtained from the Stem Cell Core (Salk Institute) and maintained on Ma-
trigel (BD)-coated dishes in complete mTeSR1 Media (Ludwig et al., 2006).
HiPSCs were infected with a human insulin GFP reporter (System Biosciences,
SR10028PA-1; hINS-GFP-Zeo) and insulin producing cells selected with Zeo-
cin. To generate hiPSCs stably expressing a human insulin reporter, a human
insulin-GFP-EF1a-neo reporter was cloned into the 307bp human insulin pro-
moter from pGZ-hInsulin vector (SR10028, System Biosciences), replacing the
Nanog promoter in pGF-Nanog-EF1a-neo (System Biosciences, TR019PA1)
with the insulin promoter (hINS-GFP-EF1a-Neo). A human Pdx1 GFP reporter
lentivirus (System Biosciences, SR10039PA-1) was used to mark pancreatic
specification. HiPSCs infected with fresh virus using Spinfection (800 3 g,
1 hr) and hINS-GFP-EF1a-Neo were selected using G418 (100 mg/ml for
1 week from 3 days after Spinfection, Corning, 30-234-Cl).
Differentiation of hiPSC to Insulin-Producing Glucose-Responsive
Cells
Reporter hiPSCs were cultured to 90% confluency in complete mTeSR Media,
at which time the media was changed to 100 ng/ml Activin (R&D Systems, 338-
AC), 25 ng/ml Wnt3a (R&D Systems, 5036-WN) in differentiation media (800 ml
DMEM/F12, 13.28 g BSA, 10 ml Glutamax, 560 mg NaHCO3, 330 mg thiamine,
100 mg reduced glutathione, 3300 mg vitamin C, 14 mg selenium, 10 ml NEAA,

 2 ml LiCl, 129.7 mg pipecolic acid, insulin 2 mg up to 1,000 ml) for 2 days and
then 100 ng/ml activin in differentiation media for another 2 days (stage 1).
Subsequently, media was replaced with differentiation media with 1 mM dorso-
morphin (Biovision, 1656-5), 2 mM retinoic acid (Sigma, R2625-1G), 10 mM
SB431542 (Sigma, S4317-5MG), and 1% B27 supplement (GIBCO, 17504-
044) for 7 days (stage 2). Media was then replaced with differentiation media
with 10 mM Forskolin (Sigma, F6886-25MG), 10 mM dexamethasone (Sigma,
D4902-100MG), 10 mM Alk5 inhibitor II (Calbiochem, 616452 or Enzo, ALX-
270-445), 10 mM nicotinamide (Sigma, 72340-100G), and 1% B27 supplement
with or without 1 mM 3,30,5-Triiodo-L-thyronine sodium salt (T3, Sigma, T6397-
100 mg) for 10 days (stage 3). Media was replaced every day (stage 1, endo-
derm differentiation), every day or every other day (stage 2, pancreatic spec-
ification) and every other day (stage 3, b-like cells). Cells were split once during
differentiation. At day 5, cells were treated with Accutase for 5 min at 37�C.
Released single cells were rinsed with PBS and spun at 1,000 rpm for 5 min.
The resulting cell pellet was resuspended in stage 2 media with or without
10 mM Y-27632 (Reagents Direct, 53-B85) and a single cell suspension seeded
at a 1:3 dilution on Matrigel-coated plates. At days 22–25, the expression of
human insulin genes and GFP were confirmed regularly by qPCR and fluores-
cence microscopy. Positive cells were used in subsequent experiments.
EGFP-adenovirus (Ad-GFP) or human ERRg adenovirus (Ad-ERRg) were
diluted in RPMI-1640 with 2% FCS, and 1 3 108 to 5 3 108 pfu/ml (MOI
100-500) used to infect b-like cells for 2 hr. Media was changed to differentia-
tion media containing 10 mM forskolin, 10 mM dexamethasone, 10 mM Alk5
inhibitor II, 10 mM nicotinamide, and 1% B27 supplement with or without
1 mM T3 for 3–5 days, then GFP-expressing b-like cells (ibLGFP cells) and
ERRg-expressing b-like cells (ibeta cells) were analyzed for RNA-seq, EM,
Seahorse, and transplantation studies. Additional information for the differen-
tiation protocol and small molecules screened or used for above protocol is
listed in Table S5. During the differentiation, cells were maintained on Matrigel
(BD)-coated dishes. Raw data of c-peptide secretion assay results from these
cells are shown in Table S6.
Virus Production
Lentiviruses were produced using second- or third-generation lentiviral sys-
tems in HEK293T cell line. Adenovirus EGFP and Cre were purchased from
Illinois University and Adenovirus ERRg was purchased from Welgen.
NOD-SCID Mice Transplantation Study
Immunodeficient NOD-SCID mice (NOD.Cg-Prkdcscid Il2rgtm1Wjl/SzJ) were
purchased from Jackson Laboratory and bred and maintained in autoclaved
cages in a SPF facility at the Salk Institute. Mice were rendered diabetic by
a single i.p. high dose of streptozotocin (STZ; 180 mg/kg, S0130–500MG)
injection. One week after STZ injection, mice with blood glucose levels higher
than 400 mg/dl were used as recipients for transplantation analyses.
Human and mouse islets (200–500 islets or 500–1,000 IEQ for mouse islets,
500–1,000 islets or 1,000–2,000 IEQ for human islets per animal) or human
iPSC-derived insulin-producing cells (ibLGPF or ibeta cells; 10 million cells
per animal) were resuspended in 200 ml RPMI-1640 media, loaded into labora-
tory tubing (SiLastic, 508-004), and centrifuged (400 3 g for 1–2 min) to
generate cell clusters in the center of the tubing. Cell clusters were trans-
planted (approximately 30–50 ml) under kidney capsules in 8- to 16-week-old
STZ-injected diabetic mice. Ketamine (80 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg)
were used as surgical anesthetics and mice were placed on 37�C heating
pads to recover.
Metabolic Cage Analyses
Metabolic cage analyses were conducted with a Comprehensive Lab Animal
Monitoring System (Columbus Instruments). CO2 production, O2 consump-
tion, RER, and ambulatory counts by x-peak were determined for 5 consecu-
tive days and nights, with at least 24 hr adaptation before data recording.
Oxygen Consumption Rate and Extracellular Acidification Rate
Measurements
Oxygen consumption rates (OCRs) and extracellular acidification rates were
recorded in 96-well plates using an XF96 seahorse (Seahorse Biosciences).
Briefly, 70 isolated islets/well were pre-cultured with 3 mM glucose XF
DMEM media (pH7.4) for 1 hr prior to transfer to Matrigel-coated XF96 cell cul-
ture plates and subsequent culture in 3 mM glucose XF DMEM media (pH 7.4).
OCRs (reported as percent change compared to 3 mM glucose) were recorded
during the incremental addition of glucose, up to a final concentration of
20 mM glucose. Insulin-positive b-like cells, sorted by flow cytometry, were
cultured for 3 days on Matrigel-coated XF96 cell culture plates (1 3 105 cells/
well) prior to infection with adenoviral EGFP or ERRg vectors. Infected cells
were pre-cultured in XF DMEM media (pH 7.4) with 3 mM glucose for 1 hr,
then the media was changed to XF DMEM media (pH 7.4) with 20 mM glucose,
1 mM sodium pyruvate, and appropriate mitochondrial stress reagents (oligo-
