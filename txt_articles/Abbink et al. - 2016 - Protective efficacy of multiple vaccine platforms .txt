Zika virus (ZIKV) is responsible for a major ongoing epidemic in the Americas and has been
causally associated with fetal microcephaly.The development of a safe and effective ZIKV vaccine
is therefore an urgent global health priority. Here we demonstrate that three different vaccine
platforms protect against ZIKVchallenge in rhesus monkeys. A purified inactivated virus vaccine
induced ZIKV-specific neutralizing antibodies and completely protected monkeys against ZIKV
strains from both Brazil and Puerto Rico. Purified immunoglobulin from vaccinated monkeys also
conferred passive protection in adoptive transfer studies. A plasmid DNAvaccine and a single-shot
recombinant rhesus adenovirus serotype 52 vector vaccine, both expressing ZIKV premembrane
and envelope, also elicited neutralizing antibodies and completely protected monkeys against
ZIKV challenge.These data support the rapid clinical development of ZIKV vaccines for humans.
T
he explosive and unprecedented ZIKV out-
break in the Americas (1, 2) prompted the
World Health Organization to declare this
epidemic a public health emergency of in-
ternational concern. ZIKV has been causally
associated with fetal microcephaly, intrauterine
growth retardation, and other congenital mal-
formations in both humans (3–6) and mice (7–9),
and it has also been linked with neurologic dis-
orders such as Guillain-Barre syndrome (10). Sev-
eral reports have shown that ZIKV can infect
placental and fetal tissues, leading to prolonged
viremia in pregnant women (11) and nonhuman
primates (12). ZIKV also appears to target cortical
neural progenitor cells (7–9, 13, 14), which likely
contributes to neuropathology.
We recently reported the protective efficacy of
two vaccines against ZIKV challenges in mice: a
purified inactivated virus (PIV) vaccine from ZIKV
strain PRVABC59 and a DNA vaccine expressing an
optimized premembrane and envelope (prM-Env)
immunogen from ZIKV strain BeH815744 (15).
These studies used ZIKV challenge strains from
Brazil (ZIKV-BR; Brazil/ZKV2015) (9) and Puerto
Rico (ZIKV-PR; PRVABC59). ZIKV replication in
mice was dependent on the mouse strain (15) and
may be less extensive than in nonhuman primates
(12). We therefore evaluated the immunogenicity
and protective efficacy of inactivated virus, DNA-
based, and vector-based vaccines against ZIKV
challenge in rhesus monkeys.
ZIKV PIV vaccine study
We first immunized 16 rhesus monkeys by the
subcutaneous route with 5 mg of ZIKV PIV vaccine
plus alum (n = 8) or sham vaccine (alum only)
(n= 8)at weeks 0 and 4 (fig. S1). All PIV-vaccinated
animals developed ZIKV Env–specific binding
antibodies, as measured by enzyme-linked im-
munosorbent assays (ELISAs), and ZIKV-specific
neutralizing antibodies, as measured by micro-
neutralization (MN50) assays, at week 2 after
initial immunization. Median log antibody titers
at week 2 were 1.87 (Fig. 1A) and 2.27 (Fig. 1B) in
ELISAs and MN50 assays, respectively. After the
week 4 boost immunization, median log anti-
body titers increased substantially to 3.54 (Fig. 1A)
and 3.66 (Fig. 1B), respectively, at week 6. In con-
trast, sham control monkeys did not develop de-
tectable ZIKV-specific antibody responses (fig. S2).
Binding antibody titers correlated with neutralizing
antibody titers in the PIV-vaccinated animals (P <
0.0001, coefficient of correlation R = 0.88, Spear-
man rank correlation test; fig. S3). Only minimal
antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis responses
were observed. The majority of PIV-vaccinated
monkeys (Fig. 1, C and D), but not sham control
animals (fig. S4), also developed modest cellular
immune responses, primarily to Env, as measured
byinterferon(IFN)–g enzyme-linked immunospot
(ELISPOT) assays.
To assess the protective efficacy of the PIV
vaccine against ZIKV challenge, we infected PIV-
immunized and sham control monkeys by the
subcutaneous route with 106 viral particles [vp;
103 plaque-forming units (PFU)] of ZIKV-BR or
ZIKV-PR (n= 4 per group) (15). Viral loads after
ZIKV challenge were quantitated by reverse tran-
scription polymerase chain reaction (15), and viral
infectivity was confirmed by growth in Vero cells.
ZIKV-specific MN50 titers increased after chal-
lenge, particularly in the sham controls (fig. S5).
Sham control monkeys exhibited 6 to 7 days of de-
tectable viremia, with median peak viral loads of
5.82 log copies/ml (range, 5.21 to 6.29 log copies/ml;
n = 8) on day 3 to 5 after challenge (Fig. 2A).
Virus was also detected in the majority of sham
control animals in urine and cerebrospinal fluid
(CSF) on day 3, as well as in colorectal secretions
and cervicovaginal secretions on day 7 (Fig. 2, B
to E). Incontrast, PIV-vaccinatedmonkeysshowed
complete protection against ZIKV challenge, as
evidenced by no detectable virus (<100 copies/ml)
in the blood, urine, CSF, colorectal secretions,
or cervicovaginal secretions in any animal after
challenge (n = 8; P = 0.0002, Fisher’s exact test
comparing PIV-vaccinated animals with sham
controls). We were unable to assess ZIKV in
semen in the male animals in this study because
of inadequate sample volumes. No major differ-
ences in plasma viral loads were observed be-
tween the sham controls that received ZIKV-BR
versus those that received ZIKV-PR (fig. S6).

 Using protein G affinity chromatography, we
purified immunoglobulin G (IgG) from plasma
from PIV-vaccinated monkeys at week 8. Vaccine-
elicited, ZIKV-specific IgG was then infused into
four groups of naïve Balb/c mice (n = 5 per group)
as fivefold serial dilutions of the purified IgG
preparation, which had a log ELISA titer of 3.30
and a log MN50 titer of 3.30. After infusion,
these groups of recipient mice (designated I, II,
III, and IV) had median log ELISA titers of
2.83, 2.35, 1.40, and <1.00 (Fig. 3A) and median
log MN50 titers of 2.93, 1.77, 1.14, and <1.00
(Fig. 3B), respectively. Mice were then challenged
by the intravenous route with 105 vp (102 PFU) of
ZIKV-BR, as we have previously described (15).
The higher two doses of purified IgG provided
complete protection after ZIKV challenge, whereas
the lower two doses of purified IgG resulted in re-
duced viremia compared with sham-infused con-
trol mice (Fig. 3, C to E).
Vaccine-elicited, ZIKV-specific IgG was also
infused into two groups of naïve rhesus monkeys
(n = 2 per group). After infusion, these groups of
recipient monkeys (designated I and II) had re-
spective median log MN50 titers of 2.11 and 1.22
(Fig. 4A). Monkeys were then challenged with
106 vp (103 PFU) of ZIKV-BR. In the animals that
received the higher IgG dose, one animal was
completely protected and the other showed a
blip of viremia on days 3 to 5 (Fig. 4B). No en-
hancement of viral replication was observed at
subtherapeutic IgG concentrations. Taken to-
gether, these data demonstrate that purified IgG
from PIV-vaccinated rhesus monkeys provided
passive protection against ZIKV challenge after
adoptive transfer to both rodents and primates.
ZIKV DNA and adenovirus vaccine study
To evaluate the immunogenicity and protective
efficacy of DNA- and vector-based ZIKV vaccines,
we immunized 12 rhesus monkeys with a plasmid
DNA vaccine (15) or a rhesus adenovirus serotype
52 (RhAd52) vector–based vaccine (16) (fig. S1).
Monkeys were immunized by the intramuscular
route with 5 mg of DNA vaccine expressing
prM-Env at weeks 0 and 4 (n = 4), with 1011 vp of
RhAd52 vector expressing prM-Env as a single
immunization at week 0 (n = 4), or with sham
vaccine at weeks 0 and 4 (n = 4). The DNA–
prM-Env vaccine induced ZIKV-specific neutral-
izing antibody titers in all animals after the week
4 boost immunization, although only minimal
MN50 titers were detected after the initial priming
immunization (Fig. 5A). In contrast, the RhAd52–
prM-Env vaccine induced ZIKV-specific neutral-
izing antibody responses in all animals at week 2
after the initial priming immunization (Fig. 5A).
Moreover, the RhAd52–prM-Env vaccine induced
a substantial breadth of antibody responses against
linear ZIKV Env epitopes, as measured by peptide

 microarray assays, compared with the other
vaccines tested (17) (fig. S7). The DNA–prM-Env
vaccine also induced detectable Env-specific IFN-
g ELISPOT responses after the week 4 boost
immunization, and the RhAd52–prM-Env vaccine
induced Env-specific cellular immune responses
after the initial week 0 priming immunization
(Fig. 5B). Monkeys were challenged 4 weeks
after the final vaccination. Both the DNA– and
the RhAd52–prM-Env vaccines provided complete
protection against subcutaneous challenge with
106 vp (103 PFU) of ZIKV-BR, as measured by
plasma viral loads (Fig. 6).
Discussion
We demonstrate that three different vaccine
platforms provide complete protection against
ZIKV challenge in rhesus monkeys. No specific
clinical safety adverse effects related to the vac-
cines were observed. We recently reported the
protective efficacy of the PIV vaccine and the
DNA–prM-Env vaccine in mice (15). The present
data confirm and extend these prior studies by
demonstrating robust protection against ZIKV
challenge in nonhuman primates and specifically
using the vaccination doses, routes, and sched-
ules that are typically evaluated in clinical trials.
Although the PIV vaccine and the DNA–prM-Env
vaccine appeared comparably immunogenic in
mice (15), the former proved more potent in rhesus
monkeys under the conditions tested (Figs. 1 and
5). To generalize these observations to a vector-
based vaccine, we also evaluated the RhAd52–prM-
Env vaccine, which proved highly immunogenic
and afforded complete protection after a single
immunization in monkeys (Fig. 5). Rhesus ade-
novirus vectors have the potential advantage of
minimal baseline vector-specific neutralizing anti-
bodies in human populations (16).
The adoptive transfer studies demonstrate that
vaccine-elicited antibodies are sufficient for pro-
tection against ZIKV challenge. Moreover, pas-
sive protection in mice and rhesus monkeys
was observed at relatively low antibody titers
(Figs. 3 and 4). Such antibody titers are likely
achievable in humans with these vaccine plat-
forms, thus raising optimism for the development
of a ZIKV vaccine for humans. Future preclinical
and clinical studies will need to address the po-
tential impact of cross-reactive antibodies against
dengue virus and other flaviviruses. Secondary
infection with a heterologous dengue serotype
can be clinically more severe than initial infection,
which may or may not reflect antibody-dependent
enhancement (18, 19). Cross-reactive antibodies
for ZIKV and dengue virus have also been de-
scribed (20, 21), and dengue-specific antibodies
have been reported to increase ZIKV replication
in vitro (22). The relevance and implications of
these findings for ZIKV vaccine development re-
main to be determined.
The consistent and robust antibody-based cor-
relates of vaccine protection against ZIKV chal-
lenge in both rodents and primates suggest the
generalizability of these findings. Similar corre-
lates of protection, and specifically neutralizing
antibody titers >10, have been reported for other
flavivirus vaccines in humans (23–25). Together,
these data suggest a path forward for clinical
development of ZIKV vaccines in humans. PIV
vaccines have been evaluated previously in clinical
trials for other flaviviruses, including dengue
virus, tick-borne encephalitis virus, and Japanese
encephalitis virus (26–30). Phase 1 clinical trials
with the ZIKV PIV vaccine, as well as other can-
didate ZIKV vaccines, are expected to begin later
this year.
