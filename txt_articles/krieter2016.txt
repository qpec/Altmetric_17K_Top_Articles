Abstract
Parenteral naloxone has been approved to treat opiate overdose for over 4 decades. Intranasal naloxone, administered “off label” using improvised
devices, has been widely used by both first responders and the lay public to treat overdose. However, these improvised devices require training for
effective use,and the recommended volumes (2 to 4 mL) exceed those considered optimum for intranasal administration.The present study compared
the pharmacokinetic properties of intranasal naloxone (2 to 8 mg) delivered in low volumes (0.1 to 0.2 mL) using an Aptar Unit-Dose device to an
approved (0.4 mg) intramuscular dose. A parallel study assessed the ease of use of this device in a simulated overdose situation. All doses of intranasal
naloxone resulted in plasma concentrations and areas under the curve greater than those observed following the intramuscular dose; the time to
reach maximum plasma concentrations was not different following intranasal and intramuscular administration. Plasma concentrations of naloxone
were dose proportional between 2 and 8 mg and independent of whether drug was administered to 1 or both nostrils. In a study using individuals
representative of the general population, >90% were able to perform both critical tasks (inserting nozzle into a nostril and pressing plunger) needed
to deliver a simulated dose of naloxone without prior training. Based on both pharmacokinetic and human use studies, a 4-mg dose delivered in a
single device (0.1 mL) was selected as the final product. This product can be used by first responders and the lay public, providing an important and
potentially life-saving intervention for victims of an opioid overdose.

Opioid overdose is a serious and evolving public health
problem in the United States.1,2 Thus, more than 28,000
overdose deaths3 and 750,000 annual emergency de-
partment visits4 have been attributed to prescription
opioids (eg, oxycodone, methadone) and heroin. Al-
though the introduction of abuse deterrent formula-
tions has apparently stabilized the death rate due to
prescription opioids, an unintended consequence has
been a dramatic rise in the rate of heroin-induced
fatalities.1,5 As part of a comprehensive effort to
limit opioid-induced fatalities, multiple government
agencies6 have endorsed wider access to naloxone (17-
allyl-4,5α-epoxy-3,14-dihyroxymorphinan-6-one HCl),
a high-affinity opiate receptor antagonist that has been
used to treat the symptoms of opioid overdose, includ-
ing respiratory depression, for over 40 years.7,8
Naloxone has been approved by the US Food and
Drug Administration (FDA) for parenteral administra-
tion, but in an attempt to reduce the morbidity and
mortality associated with opioid overdose, there has
been a dramatic increase in its off-label use by the
intranasal (IN) route.9–11 Although most morbidity and
mortality incidents are the result of accidental overdose
involving prescription opioids,12 the distribution of im-
provised IN naloxone “kits” has largely been confined
to individuals with opiate (eg, heroin) use disorders at
high risk of overdose, the friends and family of these
individuals, and first responders.10 These improvised
IN naloxone kits generally consist of 1 or 2 pre-
filled syringes, each containing 2 mL of naloxone HCl
(1 mg/mL) and a mucosal atomizing device. Individuals

administering the naloxone are instructed to give half
a vial, or 1 mL, in each nostril (for a total dose
of 2 mL); a second dose can be administered if the
patient has not responded to the first dose.9,10 Despite
multiple reports describing the effectiveness of using
these improvised intranasal devices in reversing opiate
overdose,9–11,13,14 a high error rate has been associated
with both kit assembly and proper IN administration,
even in individuals receiving training.15 Moreover, it
is not known if the pharmacokinetic (PK) properties
of naloxone produced by these improvised IN devices
are equivalent to the approved dose of parenterally
administered naloxone. Here, we describe the PK prop-
erties and usability profile of an IN naloxone HCl
formulation delivered in low volume (0.1 mL) that was
recently approved by the FDA for the treatment of
opioid overdose.
Methods
Pharmacokinetic Study
Study Participants.
The PK study was approved by
the MidLands Independent Review Board (Overland
Park, Kansas); all subjects gave written informed
consent before participation. The study was carried
out in accordance with the International Confer-
ence on Harmonisation for Good Clinical Practices
guidelines.16 This trial was registered as NCT02572089
(www.clinicaltrials.gov).
Male and female volunteers aged 18 to 55 years with
body mass index (BMI) 18 to 30 kg/m2 participated
in the PK study. Subjects were currently not taking
either prescription or over-the-counter medications;
nonsmokers and subjects who smoked 20 or fewer
cigarettes per day were enrolled. Screening procedures
conducted within 21 days of study initiation included
the following: medical history, physical examination,
evidence of nasal irritation, 12-lead electrocardiogram,
complete blood count, clinical chemistry, coagula-
tion markers, hepatitis and human immunodeficiency
screening, urinalysis, and urine drug screen. Female
subjects were tested for pregnancy at screening and
admission to the clinic. Subjects were excluded if they
had either abnormal nasal anatomy or symptoms, an
upper respiratory tract infection, used opioid analgesics
for pain relief within the previous 14 days, or, in
the judgment of the investigator, had significant acute
or chronic medical conditions. Subjects were required
to abstain from grapefruit juice and alcohol from
72 hours prior to admission to the end of the last blood
draw of the study and from nicotine- and caffeine-
containing products and food for at least 1 hour prior
to and 2 hours after dose administration. On days of
dosing, a subject’
s vital signs were required to be within
the normal range before administration of naloxone,
defined as systolic blood pressure >90 mm Hg and
�140 mm Hg; diastolic blood pressure >55 mm Hg
and �90 mm Hg; resting heart rate >40 beats per
minute (bpm) and �100 bpm; and respiratory rate >8
respirations per minute (rpm) and �20 rpm.
Study Design.
The PK study was an inpatient, open-
label, randomized, 5-period, 5-treatment, 5-sequence,
crossover study conducted at Vince & Associates Clin-
ical Research (Overland Park, Kansas). Subjects were
randomly assigned to 1 of the 5 sequences to ensure
at least 6 subjects in each sequence. On the day after
clinic admission, participants were administered the
study drug in randomized order with a 4-day washout
period between doses. Subjects remained in the clinic
for 19 days until all 5 treatments were administered and
returned 3 to 5 days after discharge for a follow-up visit.
Subjects were fasted overnight before each dosing day
and received 1 of the following 5 treatments:
A. 2 mg naloxone IN (a single 0.1-mL spray of the
20 mg/mL formulation in 1 nostril)
B. 4 mg naloxone IN (a single 0.1-mL spray of the
20 mg/mL formulation in each nostril)
C. 4 mg naloxone IN (a single 0.1-mL spray of the
40 mg/mL formulation in 1 nostril)
D. 8 mg naloxone IN (a single 0.1-mL spray of the
40 mg/mL formulation in each nostril)
E. 0.4 mg naloxone IM (1.0 mL of the 0.4 mg/mL
naloxone HCl for injection in the gluteus maximus)
These doses were chosen based on a pilot study
using 2 mg and 4 mg naloxone delivered in low volumes
(0.1-0.2 mL) with a different device (data not shown).
The IN devices were coded so that neither the staff
nor the subjects knew the concentration of naloxone
solution administered. IN naloxone was administered
in the supine position, and subjects remained in
this position for approximately 1 hour after dosing.
Subjects were instructed not to breathe when the drug
was administered to simulate an opioid overdose with
a patient in respiratory arrest. The nasal passage was
examined by medical personnel for irritation using a
6-point scale at predose and at 5 minutes and 0.5, 1,
4, and 24 hours postdose. Nasal irritation was scored
as follows: 0 (normal-appearing mucosa, no bleeding);
1 (inflamed mucosa, no bleeding); 2 (minor bleeding
that stops within 1 minute); 3 (minor bleeding taking
1 to 5 minutes to stop); 4 (substantial bleeding for 4
to 60 minutes, does not require medical intervention);
and 5 (ulcerated lesions, bleeding that requires medical
intervention).

Study Drugs.
Naloxone HCl powder (cGMP grade,
99.8% purity) was purchased from Mallinckrodt (St.
Louis, Missouri); naloxone HCl for injection was man-
ufactured by Hospira, Inc (Lake Forest, Illinois). Nasal
devices (Aptar Unit-Dose device for liquids, Louve-
ciennes, France) were supplied by Lightlake Ther-
apeutics, Inc (New York, New York). The devices,
containing naloxone HCl concentrations of 20 mg/mL
and 40 mg/mL, were manufactured by DPT Labora-
tories, Ltd (Lakewood, New Jersey) and delivered a
volume of 0.1 mL.
Analytical
Methods.
Plasma
naloxone
concentra-
tions
were
determined
using
a
validated
liquid
chromatography-tandem
mass
spectrometry
(LC-
MS/MS) assay. Plasma samples (0.2 mL) were added to
individual wells of a 96-well plate along with 0.05 mL
methanol:water (3:7) containing the internal standard
(0.1 ng naloxone-d5) and 0.2 mL 1 M potassium
phosphate (pH 7.2). After vortex mixing, the plate was
loaded onto a preconditioned 96-well SPE plate and
washed sequentially with 0.1% formic acid, acetonitrile,
and
dichloromethane:isopropanol
(8:2).
Naloxone
was eluted with dichloromethane/isopropanol (8:2)
containing 2% ammonium hydroxide to a new 96-well
plate. After evaporation, the residue was reconstituted
in 0.2 mL methanol:water (9:1) and submitted to
LC-MS/MS analysis. Naloxone was analyzed using
an AB MDS Sciex API-5000 LC-MS/MS system
(Framingham, Massachusetts) with an atmospheric
pressure chemical ionization source operated in the
positive ion mode. The mobile phase consisted of
a gradient increasing from 60% mobile phase A
(0.04% ammonium hydroxide):40% mobile phase B
(methanol:acetonitrile, 1:1) to 20% A/80% B with a flow
rate of 0.4 mL/min through a 50×2.1 mm XBridge C18
column. Naloxone eluted at approximately 2 minutes.
Ions monitored were m/z 328.3 and 212.1 for naloxone
and m/z 333.3 and 212.1 for the internal standard. The
calibration curves (peak area ratios) were linear (r2 >
0.980) over the concentration range of 10.0 pg/mL to
10 ng/mL; the lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) was
10.0 pg/mL. The interday precision of the calibration
curves and quality control samples ranged from 2.1%
to 7.9%, and the accuracy ranged between –2.4% and
3.8% during the analysis of the samples.
Data Analyses.
The safety population included all
subjects who received at least 1 dose of naloxone; the
PK population included all subjects who received at
least 1 dose of naloxone with sufficient data to calcu-
late meaningful PK parameters. PK parameters were
calculated using standard noncompartmental methods
and a validated installation of WinNonlin
R
� Phoenix,
version 6.3 (Pharsight Corp, St. Louis, Missouri).
Values of peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) and the
time to reach Cmax (tmax) were the observed values
obtained directly from the concentration-time data.
The terminal elimination half-life (t½) was estimated
by linear regression analysis. The area under the
concentration-time curve from time 0 to the last quan-
tifiable concentration (AUC0-t) was determined by the
linear trapezoidal method and extrapolated to infinity
(AUC0-�) by adding the value of the last quantifiable
concentration divided by the terminal rate constant
(λz). The extrapolated percentage of AUC0-� was less
than 20% for all concentration profiles; therefore, only
AUC0-� is reported. The apparent total body clear-
ance (CL/F) was calculated as the dose divided by
AUC0-�. PK comparisons were performed using a
mixed-effects model in which sequence, period, and
treatment were independent factors. Dose proportion-
ality for all IN doses of naloxone was accessed using
Cmax and AUC0-� parameters. In this analysis the
mixed-effects power model [ln(PK) = β0 + ηi + β1 ×
ln(Dose) + εij] was used, and 90% confidence inter-
vals (90%CI) were constructed for the ratio of the
dose-normalized geometric mean values (Rdnm) of the
parameters.17 All analyses of demographic and safety
data were performed using SAS
R
� statistical software,
version 9.3 (SAS Institute, Inc, Cary, North Carolina).
Human Factors and Usability Studies
Study Participants.
The study was reviewed and ap-
proved by Concentrics Institutional Review Board
(Indianapolis, Indiana); participants or a guardian
reviewed and gave written informed consent before
participation. The study was carried out in accordance
with the Draft Guidance for Industry and Food and
Drug Administration Staff: Applying Human Factors
and Usability Engineering to Optimize Medical De-
vice Design, June 22, 201118 and the Guidance for
Industry—Label Comprehension Studies for Nonpre-
scription Drug Products, August 2010.19
Adolescents aged 12 to 17 years and adults 18 years
of age or older participated in the 2 human use studies.
The REALM test20 and REALM-Teen test21 were
administered to the adults and adolescents, respectively,
in order to screen literacy levels for information only
in analyzing the population. The tests are based on a
list of 66 words commonly found on medication labels.
The subjects needed to be able to read, speak, and
understand the nature of the study procedures. They
were excluded if they had ever been trained or employed
as a healthcare professional or had participated in any
clinical trial, product label study, or market research
study in the past 12 months.

Study Design.
The study was conducted in rooms
equipped with 1-way mirrors for observation. To
simulate a real-life emergency, study participants were
challenged with administering the medication to an un-
conscious victim, simulated by a full-sized mannequin.
No training on the use of the device was provided prior
to the usability assessment.
Intranasal devices (Aptar Unit-Dose device, Louve-
ciennes, France) were filled with 0.1 mL of water and
packed into a blister card. The blister card, along with
a Quick Study Guide (QSG) and patient information
section of the package insert were packed into a carton.
Study A (2 devices) was slightly more complex and
was conducted prior to study B (1 device) in order to
determine if individuals were able to perform critical
tasks without reviewing the QSG. The objective of
the QSG was to provide clear and concise instructions
(combined with pictures) for use in a crisis situation
with limited time to interpret the directions (Figure 1).
Subjects in study A were randomized to 1 of 2 arms:
subjects in arm 1 were given an opportunity to read the
QSG in advance of the simulation, whereas subjects in
arm 2 did not review the QSG in advance. Subjects in
study B (1 device) did not review the QSG in advance
of the simulation.
Subjects were presented with a scenario of an un-
conscious overdose victim simulated by a life-sized
mannequin similar to those used for cardiopulmonary
resuscitation training. Subjects were given the product
with labeling and asked to proceed as they would in
a real-life emergency; no training or coaching was
provided either prior to or during the simulation.
Background noise, in the form of TV and radio, was in-
troduced into the scenario to simulate voices and noise
from onlookers. A trained observer (located behind a
1-way mirror) documented the steps that the subject
took during the simulation. Once the subject completed
the simulation, an interview was conducted in a sepa-
rate room to evaluate comprehension of key concepts
in the patient information section of the package
insert. After the comprehension interview, additional
questions were asked about any incorrect actions that
were observed during the human factors testing; this
information was obtained in order to identify any
potentially confusing sections of the labeling.
Data Analyses.
The primary endpoints for the critical
tasks were (1) inserting the device nozzle into a nostril
and (2) pressing the plunger to release a dose into the
nose. Secondary endpoints included (3) checking for re-
sponse, (4) calling 911, and (5) moving to a recovery po-
sition after administering dose. Study A also included
(6) waiting 2 to 3 minutes to assess the effectiveness of
the first dose and (7) readministration using a new unit
(if needed). As a subject interfaced with a mannequin
rather than a person, the observer was able to make
judgments on mitigating circumstances in which the
subject was either restricted or confounded by the
mannequin. This allows a response that is “not perfect
or technically correct” to be considered as “correct”
if the subject’
s intent indicates that he or she either
understood the correct action or that the apparent
incorrect action has no safety risk. An example would
be partial insertion into the mannequin’
s nose because
it lacked flexibility of a human nose. These were added
to the final correct performance scores of primary and
secondary tasks.
The correct score and lower boundary of the 95%CI
were calculated for each of the 2 human factors primary
endpoints. The correct score was the point estimate
for execution of both critical tasks, defined as the
total number of subjects who correctly completed both
critical tasks, divided by the number of subjects who
performed the tasks, multiplied by 100. Success criteria
for the combined primary endpoints had a lower bound
threshold of at least 69% for the correct scores in
study A (2 devices) or at least 73% for the correct
scores in study B (1 device). This was based on sample
size and CIs around a mean, a point estimate of the
population mean. For all remaining human factors
tasks and comprehension objectives, correct scores and
2-sided 95%CIs were computed; however, no thresholds
were established. Subgroup analyses were conducted
to evaluate any potential differences between subjects
with low literacy and adolescent subjects aged 12 to
17 years. An error rate of 6% for each task was
estimated based on preliminary qualitative work using
untrained users completing each task. This led to a
projected probability of completing both critical core
tasks correctly for any particular subject to be at least
88%. This estimate is consistent with rates accepted by
the FDA for other approved products expected to be
used by the lay public, including nasal sprays. With a
sample size of 30 subjects per arm, the probability of
having the lower bound of the 2-sided 95%CI (of the
estimated proportion of subjects correctly completing
all core tasks) above the predefined 69% threshold was
87%, assuming the true correct demonstration of the
core tasks rate was 88%. With a sample size of 50
subjects, the probability of having the lower bound
of the 2-sided 95%CI (of the estimated proportion of
subjects correctly completing all core tasks) being above
the predefined 73% threshold was 88%, assuming the
true correct simulated use demonstration of the core
tasks rate was 88%.

28 subjects completed the study. One male subject dis-
continued the study after 1 treatment period (treatment
C) due to a systolic blood pressure greater than 140 mm
Hg prior to the start of the second period. This predose
elevation in blood pressure was judged to be unrelated
to drug treatment. One other male subject withdrew
for personal reasons after completing 4 treatments; this
individual did not receive treatment C.
Pharmacokinetics.
Naloxone plasma concentrations
were above the lower limit of quantitation (10.0 pg/mL)
at 2.5 minutes after IN administration, the first
collection time point, in all but 1 (an individual
receiving an 8-mg dose) of 114 samples collected;
concentrations were measurable in 22 of 29 samples
following IM injection (data not shown). The median
tmax values after IN and IM doses ranged from 20
minutes to 30 minutes, indicating that naloxone was ab-
sorbed rapidly following either route of administration
(Table 2; Figure 2). The mean Cmax values increased
from 3.1 ng/mL to 10.3 ng/mL as the IN dose increased
from 2 mg to 8 mg; the mean Cmax value following
IM dosing was 0.9 ng/mL. AUC0-� increased from
4.7 ng·h/mL to 15.8 ng·h/mL as the IN dose increased
4-fold from 2 mg to 8 mg. The terminal elimination
half-life of naloxone after all 4 IN regimens was ap-
proximately 2 hours; it was 1.3 hours after the IM injec-
tion. The geometric mean ratios of the dose-corrected
Cmax values of the IN doses compared to the IM dose
ranged between 55.1% and 70.8%, whereas the ratio
was approximately half for AUC0-� (Table 3). Based
on the actual and dose-corrected values of Cmax and
AUC, the IM and IN doses were not equivalent. The
pharmacokinetic properties of naloxone following IN
administration were similar between male and female
subjects for all 4 treatments (Figure 3, Table 4).

A power model was used to test for dose propor-
tionality following IN naloxone.17 This was assessed
by plotting the slope of the log dose and the log of
Cmax and AUC0-�. A slope equal to 1.0 would indicate
dose proportionality. The slope and 90%CI of the line
for Cmax were 0.83 and 0.74 to 0.93. For AUC0-�, the
slope and 90%CI of the line were 0.85 and 0.78 to
0.91, indicating exposure to naloxone approached dose
proportionality as the dose was increased from 2 mg to
8 mg.
Safety.
There were no differences in the safety profile
of IN naloxone compared to IM dosing. No significant
erythema, edema, erosion, or other signs were observed

in the nasal cavity prior to or after administration of
IN naloxone. Few adverse events (AEs) associated with
the nasal mucosa were reported; all were mild (grade 1),
transient, and with no clear relationship to dose
(Table 5). Vital signs, ECG, and clinical laboratory
parameters did not reveal any clinically significant
changes or evidence of QTcF prolongation after nalox-
one administration. Two additional AEs were reported
with IN administration: 1 for nasal pain after the 2-mg
dose and 1 for headache after the 8-mg dose.
Human Factors and Usability
Subject Characteristics.
The human factors studies
were conducted in a population of 116 participants
(Table 6). Combined, 33 subjects were adolescents (aged
12 to 17 years), and 83 were adults (aged 18 years or
older). A total of 59 (50.9%) had low literacy, and 57
(49.1%) had normal literacy.
Subjects demonstrated the ability to correctly per-
form both critical tasks, meeting the success threshold
in studies using either 1 or 2 devices (Table 7). Using
1 device, 90.6% of subjects (n = 48 of 53) were able
to correctly perform both critical tasks. Similar results
were obtained in the study using 2 devices: in arm
1, which included a review of the QSG, 90.6% (n =
29 of 32) of subjects correctly performed both critical
tasks, while in arm 2, 90.3% (n = 28 of 31) of subjects
 8
The Journal of Clinical Pharmacology / Vol 00 No 0 2016
correctly performed both critical tasks without review-
ing the QSG. In all cases the lower bound of the 95%CI
was exceeded. Five secondary human factors tasks
(Table 7) were also evaluated with correct performance
ranging from 37.7% to 93.8% depending on whether
1 or 2 devices was used and whether or not the QSG
was reviewed in advance. Among the secondary tasks
evaluated, 70% to 80% of subjects correctly adminis-
tered a second IN dose, although fewer than 60% were
able to correctly administer this second dose within 2
to 3 minutes of the first dose (Table 7). Among other
secondary tasks evaluated, the lowest scoring items
included moving the victim to a recovery position and
waiting 2 to 3 minutes before administering a second
dose (Table 7). Comprehension was also evaluated
on 9 communication objectives found in the patient
information section of the package insert to insure that
the general population could understand key messages.
Overall, the scores were high, ranging from 70% to
100%, with most scores in the 90% to 100% range
(Table 8).
Discussion
Here, we demonstrate that IN administration of a
naloxone HCl (2 to 8 mg) formulation in low volume
(0.1 to 0.2 mL) results in PK parameters that either
equal or exceed those observed following the IM dose
of naloxone (0.4 mg) that is approved for the treatment
of opioid overdose. The time to peak naloxone plasma
concentration following IN administration was inde-
pendent of dose and ranged from 0.3 hour to 0.5 hour
compared with 0.4 hour following IM injection (Table
4). The maximum plasma concentration obtained be-
tween 2 mg and 8 mg approached dose proportionality,
exceeded the maximum concentration produced by the
0.4 mg IM dose of naloxone, and was independent of
delivery to either 1 or both nostrils (Table 2, Figure 2).
Moreover, at the earliest time sampled (2.5 minutes),
plasma naloxone concentrations after IN administra-
tion of 2 mg to 8 mg were higher than following
the 0.4-mg IM dose; this rapid rise may be advan-
tageous for reversing respiratory depression in opioid
overdose.
The high plasma concentrations of naloxone fol-
lowing IN administration reported here (Figure 2,
Table 2) may be viewed as surprising based on a study
reporting an absolute bioavailability of 4% after IN
administration.22 In that study, naloxone (0.8 and 2 mg)
was administered in volumes of 1 and 2.5 mL/nostril
with a mucosal atomizing device. Optimal delivery vol-
umes for IN drug administration are �0.2 mL/nostril.23
This low bioavailability was attributed to the delivery
of relatively large volumes to healthy, awake volunteers
who swallowed significant amounts of drug that pooled

in the nasopharynx.22 These authors hypothesized that
unconscious patients with depressed oropharyngeal re-
flexes may swallow less IN naloxone, thereby increasing
absorption and bioavailability. Although there are no
peer-reviewed, published studies describing the PK
properties of IN naloxone dosed with an improvised
device (that is, 2 mg to 4 mg administered in a volume
of up to 2 mL in each nostril), based on the Dowling
et al study,22 plasma concentrations are likely to fall
below the lowest approved (0.4 mg) parenteral dose.24
Nonetheless, multiple reports9–11 have described the
reversal of an apparent opioid overdose using these IN
improvised devices. These retrospective reports focus
on successful rescues but do not provide insight into
treatment failures.24–26
Multiple studies have demonstrated sex differences
in the PK properties of drugs,27,28 and an interaction
between sex and route of administration has also been
documented. For example, the Cmax of cocaine is twice
as high in males compared to females when adminis-
tered IN29 but is similar when given IV
.30 In the present
study, no sex differences were observed in the PK profile
of IN naloxone at doses between 2 mg and 8 mg
(Figure 3, Table 4), indicating that both males and
females will respond similarly in a rescue situation.
Administration of IN naloxone obviates the poten-
tial for needlestick harm and is especially useful for
individuals either unable or unwilling to administer
an injection. Moreover, the single-use spray is intuitive
and rapid: subjects could use the device and deliver
 10
The Journal of Clinical Pharmacology / Vol 00 No 0 2016
a dose of naloxone without either prior training or
review of the QSG (Table 7). A single-use device also
avoids the potential for confusion around the timing of
a second dose, which is associated with an error rate of
>40% whether or not the QSG is reviewed (Table 5).
Because naloxone has a short half-life (Table 2) relative
to many prescription opioids including hydrocodone
and methadone,31–33 the plasma concentrations pro-
duced by these doses of IN naloxone may provide a
more durable reversal of opioid overdose than either
improvised IN naloxone kits or a lower approved initial
dose (Figures 2 and 3).
Retrospective analyses suggest that improvised IN
naloxone kits can be used effectively, even in the absence
of training.9,34 Nonetheless, a prospective comparative
usability study15 found that despite training, fewer
than 60% of participants were able to successfully
administer a simulated IN dose using an improvised
nasal naloxone kit; in the absence of training, none of
the 42 participants in this study successfully assembled
the device and delivered a simulated dose of naloxone.15
By contrast, human factors studies demonstrated that
participants were able to correctly perform the 2 critical
tasks (insert device in nostril and deliver a dose of
medication) necessary to administer a simulated dose
of naloxone using an Aptar Unit-Dose device with a
success rate >90%, even when no prior training or guid-
ance was provided (Table 7). This high rate of success
is not surprising because the device is intuitive, and
has been used effectively in other IN products available
to the lay public, including sumatriptan (Imitrex
R
�).
Moreover, comprehension scores were high for most
of the key communication objectives in the patient
information section of the package insert (Table 8),
indicating that the labeling is clear.
Because naloxone is a competitive opiate receptor
antagonist, its efficacy in reversing overdose depends on
both the quantity of opioids ingested and their relative
affinities for opiate receptors. This information is rarely
available to first responders (or bystanders) attempting
to resuscitate a suspected overdose. A single dose of
4 mg naloxone was selected as the final formulation for
Narcan
R
� Nasal Spray because it delivers approximately
the same amount of drug as 2 mg IM (Table 3), the
highest recommended initial dose for treating suspected
opioid overdose.35 In addition to the simplicity as-
sociated with a single administration, the 4-mg IN
dose increases the potential for a reversal of opioid
overdose compared to either improvised IN devices24–26
or the approved autoinjector that delivers 0.4 mg of
naloxone.36 This is especially relevant because of the
dramatic rise in the abuse of high-potency opioids
such as fentanyl37 that require higher concentrations of
naloxone to treat overdose.25 Based on the selectivity
of naloxone for opiate receptors and the human use
characteristics described here, this product can be used
safely and effectively with no prior training to provide
an important and potentially life-saving intervention
for the treatment of opioid overdose.
