functioning post intervention (N=1,449; SMD=0.506; 95%CI=0.347, 
0.665; p<.001). Improvements in global symptoms (N=849; SMD=-0.297; 
 
95%CI=-0.484, 
-0.111; 
p=.002) 
and 
positive 
symptoms 
(N=784; 
SMD=-0.227; 
 
95%CI=-0.416, -0.038; p=.018) were also found. Compensatory interven-
tions were not associated with improvements in negative symptoms (N=736; 
 
SMD=-0.162; 95%CI=-0.382, 0.058; p=.150). The heterogeneity of find-
ings was low.
Discussion: Compensatory approaches are effective for improving func-
tioning in psychosis, with a medium effect size. General symptoms and 
positive symptoms appear to benefit from compensatory approaches, but 
compensatory approaches are not effective for improving negative symp-
toms. Future analyses will examine the durability of effects, effects of study 
quality and moderating factors such as pure vs. partially compensatory, 
treatment intensity/length, mode of delivery (group vs. individual), baseline 
functioning level and age of participants.

Background: Diet is increasingly recognised as a modifiable factor influenc-
ing the onset and outcomes of psychiatric disorders. Previous meta-analy-
ses of blood nutrient levels in schizophrenia have already shown significant 
reductions in various individual vitamins/minerals. However, studies to 
date have largely focused on individual nutrients, and only considered nutri-
ent status in patients with long-term schizophrenia. Meta-analytic evalua-
tion of the evidence for nutrient deficits in first-episode psychosis (FEP) 
is completely absent. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review of all 
published studies comparing blood levels of vitamins and/or mineral in 
FEP to healthy control samples; and applied meta-analytic techniques to 
determine the prevalence and extent of deficiencies across the full spectrum 
of nutrients examined in this population to date.
Methods: We searched electronic databases from inception to July 2017 
for all studies examining blood levels (i.e. serum, plasma or whole blood) 
of nutrient levels in people with FEP compared to healthy controls. Our 
systematic search identified 28 eligible studies, examining blood levels 
of 16 different nutrients (six vitamins, ten dietary minerals) across 2,612 
individuals: 1,221 patients with FEP and 1,391 control subjects. Random 
effects meta-analyses compared nutrient levels in FEP to healthy controls. 
Clinical correlates of nutritional status in patient samples were systemati-
cally reviewed.
Results: Random effects meta-analyses found that people with FEP had 
large, significant reductions in blood levels of vitamin B9 (i.e. folate) 
compared to healthy controls(N=6, n=827, g=-0.624, 95% C.I.=-1.176 
to -0.072, p=0.027). Significant reductions were also found for vitamin D 
(N=7, n=906, g=-1.055, 95% C.I.=-1.99 to -0.119, p=0.027) and, among 
fewer studies, vitamin C (N=2, n=96, g=-2.207, 95% C.I.=-3.71 to -0.71, 
p=0.004). No differences were found for other vitamins or minerals. 
Systematic synthesis of clinical correlates showed that reductions in both 
folate and vitamin D held significant relationships with greater psychiatric 
symptoms in FEP.
Discussion: This is the first meta-analysis to examine the prevalence, extent 
and clinical correlates of nutritional deficiencies in FEP to date. The deficits 
in vitamin D and folate which have previously been observed in long-term 
schizophrenia appear to exist from illness onset, even prior to antipsychotic 
treatment, and are associated with more severe symptoms. The extent and 
importance of these deficiencies suggests that routine screening for vitamin 
D and folate deficiencies should be considered in early intervention services. 
Furthermore, since our previous meta-analyses have shown that high-dose 
b-vitamin supplementation can reduce symptoms in long-term schizophre-
nia, this should now be investigated in FEP. The potential physical and psy-
chological benefits of vitamin D supplementation in early psychosis should 
also be explored. However, further research is needed to establish casual 
and mechanistic relationships between vitamin deficiencies, poor diet and 
the onset and outcomes of psychotic disorders.
S205. TRANSCRANIAL DIRECT CURRENT

Background: Up to 25% of schizophrenia patients continue to experience 
distressing auditory hallucinations despite best efforts at treatment with 
antipsychotic drugs. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has 
been suggested to rapidly attenuate such persistent hallucinations.
Methods: We treated 23 schizophrenia patients with persistent, antipsy-
chotic-refractory auditory hallucinations using tDCS in a single-group, 
open-label design. tDCS was administered at 2 mA current intensity for 
20 min, twice-daily and 4 h apart, across 5 consecutive days; the anode 
was placed over the the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the cath-
ode over the left temporoparietal junction. Ongoing antipsychotic medica-
tions were continued unchanged. Patients were assessed using the Auditory 
Hallucinations Rating Scale (AHRS) at treatment endpoint and at 1- and 
3-month follow up. Response was defined as 50% or greater attenuation in 
AHRS scores.
Results: All patients completed the study. tDCS resulted in substantial 
improvement. Mean (standard deviation) AHRS scores dropped from 
29.0(8.3) at baseline to 4.4(5.6) at treatment endpoint; these values were 
9.3(9.3) and 7.8(8.4) at 1- and 3-months follow up. The response rate was 
91.3%, 69.6%, and 82.6% at the 3 posttreatment assessment points, respec-
tively. Complete remission of hallucinations (AHRS=0) was observed in 
61%, 44%, and 44% at the 3 posttreatment assessment points. tDCS was 
very well tolerated and adverse effects were minimal.
Discussion: tDCS is effective and well tolerated in schizophrenia patients 
with persistent, antipsychotic-refractory auditory hallucinations. In most 
patients, the benefits last for up to 3 months or longer.

Background: Evidence till date shows different reasons of relapse in schiz-
ophrenia around the world. However, there was almost no reliable data 
from Nepal. We want to report a thematic study based on the reports of 12 
patients living with schizophrenia and their family members. These patients 
were approached during psychoeducation group sessions.
Methods: Twelve patients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia as per 
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of mental disorders-5 criteria, who 
were accompanied by their family members were selected. A minimum
