Children consume too much sugar and not enough fruit and vegetables, increasing their risk of adverse
health outcomes. Inhibitory control training (ICT) reduces children's and adults' intake of energy-dense
foods in both laboratory and real-life settings. However, no studies have yet examined whether ICT can
increase healthy food choice when energy-dense options are also available. We investigated whether a
food-specific Go/No-Go task could influence the food choices of children aged 4e11, as measured by a
hypothetical food choice task using healthy and unhealthy food images printed on cards. Participants
played either an active game (healthy foods ¼ 100% go, unhealthy foods ¼ 100% no-go; Studies 1 & 2), a
food control game (both healthy and unhealthy foods ¼ 50% go, 50% no-go; Studies 1 & 2) or a non-food
control game (sports equipment ¼ 100% go, technology ¼ 100% no-go; Study 2 only) followed by the
choice task. In Study 2, food card choices were also measured before training to examine change in
choices. A post-training real food choice task was added to check that choices made in the card-based
task were representative of choices made when faced with real healthy and unhealthy foods. Overall,
the active group chose the greatest number of healthy food cards. Study 2 confirmed that this was due to
increases in healthy food card choice in this group only. Active group participants chose a greater number
of healthy foods in the real food choice task compared to children in the non-food control group only. The
results are discussed with reference to methodological issues and the development of future healthy
eating interventions.

1. Introduction
The average European child does not consume a healthy diet. In
the UK, only 10% of boys and 7% of girls eat the recommended
amount of fruit and vegetables per day (Public Health England,
2014), compared to 23.5% of children across Europe (Lynch et al.,
2014). Concurrently, British children ingest up to three times the
guideline World Health Organization daily sugar allowance (House
of Commons Health Committee, 2015) which comes primarily from
sugary beverages, confectionery, biscuits and cakes (Public Health
England, 2015a). Such foods are superfluous to a healthy diet
(Public Health England, 2015a) and can contribute to the devel-
opment of dental carries, obesity, cognitive impairments and dis-
eases such as diabetes (Noble & Kanoski, 2016; Public Health
England, 2015b). Given that dietary habits are consolidated in
childhood, it is imperative that changes are made during this period
(Haire-Joshu & Tabak, 2016).
Current healthy lifestyle interventions typically depend upon
education
and
top-down
self-regulation
of
behavior
(Sobol-
Goldberg, Rabinowitz, & Gross, 2013). However, children's top-
down control capacities are immature compared to the bottom-
up processes that may motivate them to consume energy-dense
foods (Bunge, Dudukovic, Thomason, Vaidya, & Gabrieli, 2002; Ha
et al., 2016; Nigg, 2017). Furthermore, emphasizing the health
benefits of foods can have the adverse effect of decreasing con-
sumption amongst children (Maimaran & Fishbach, 2014) whilst
palatability of foods remains a strong factor in food selection
(Nguyen, Girgis, & Robinson, 2015). It has previously been noted
that educational campaigns may be ineffectual due to their neglect
of the automatic processes that contribute towards behavior
(Marteau, Hollands, & Fletcher, 2012) and dual-process models

 propose that behavior is the outcome of implicit/automatic pro-
cesses as well as deliberate ‘top-down’ control (e.g., Hofmann,
Friese, & Strack, 2009). Indeed, a wide body of research points to-
wards the contribution of implicit processes such as high reward-
sensitivity, which then interacts with individual variations in
inhibitory control to predict the onset and maintenance of over-
eating and obesity (Bartholdy, Dalton, Daly, Campbell & Schmidt,
2016; Brockmeyer, Sinno, Skunde et al., 2016; Lawrence, Hinton,
Parkinson, & Lawrence, 2012; Meule & Platte, 2016; Nederkoorn,
Houben, Hofmann, Roefs, & Jansen, 2010; Saunders & Robinson,
2013; Stice, Lawrence, Kemps, & Veling, 2016).
This has led to calls for an alternative approach to tackling un-
healthy eating behavior by targeting more automatic, implicit
processes (Marteau et al., 2012). One such approach uses food-
specific inhibitory control training (ICT) to train automatic control
over responses to foods in Go/No-Go or Stop Signal tasks (Allom,
Mullan, & Hagger, 2016; Houben & Jansen, 2015; Jones et al.,
2016; Lawrence, Verbruggen, Morrison, Adams, & Chambers,
2015a). Participants are trained to perform a motor response
(keyboard press) when presented with a go signal and to inhibit
this response when presented with a stop (or no-go) signal. By
consistently pairing unhealthy stimuli (e.g., chocolate, alcohol)
with motor inhibition, ICT has been found to reduce selection and
consumption of unhealthy foods and beverages in adult pop-
ulations (Veling, Aarts, & Stroebe, 2013; Allom et al., 2016; Jones
et al., 2016; but see also; Smith, Dash, Johnstone, Houben, &
Field, 2017) and has even led to weight loss in overweight young
adults and community samples (Veling, van Koningsbruggen, Aarts,
& Stroebe, 2014; Lawrence et al., 2015b).
The mechanisms behind such training are thought to be
twofold; firstly, consistently associating a stimulus with inhibition
encourages the development of stimulus-stop associations, helping
to automatize inhibitory control in response to that stimulus
(Lenartowicz, Verbruggen, Logan, & Poldrack, 2011; Verbruggen &
Logan, 2008; Verbruggen, Best, Bowditch, Stevens, & McLaren,
2014). Secondly, consistently inhibiting responses to a rewarding
stimulus has the effect of devaluing that stimulus (Chen, Veling,
Dijksterhuis, & Holland, 2016; Houben, Havermans, Nederkoorn,
& Jansen, 2012; Lawrence et al., 2015b; Veling, Holland, & van
Knippenberg, 2008). These findings suggest that ICT could boost
impulse control towards food (automatic motor inhibition) and
reduce reward sensitivity, two processes that contribute to poor
dietary choices.
Despite evidence that obesity and intake of energy-dense foods
in
children
is
also
associated
with
poor
inhibitory
control
(Nederkoorn, Braet, Van Eijs, Tanghe, & Jansen, 2006) and high
reward-sensitivity (Bruce et al., 2010), little research to date has
investigated the impact of ICT on children's eating behavior. One
study found that children consumed fewer calories after playing an
ICT game in which images of jelly sweets were paired with stop
signals relative to children who were trained to stop to non-food
images (Folkvord, Veling, & Hoeken, 2016). As well as consuming
fewer of these jelly sweets post-training, the effects also general-
ized to milk chocolate shells. Another study found that non-
computerized ICT (in the form of a “Simon says” style game
played in the classroom) decreased children's intake of a food
paired with response inhibition (Jiang, He, Guan, & He, 2016).
However, children in these studies were only trained to inhibit
to unhealthy foods and were only provided with such foods after
training; healthy foods were not included in these experiments. It is
therefore unknown whether ICT can also be used to increase
healthy food selection and intake in children whilst simultaneously
decreasing unhealthy food selection and intake. Some studies with
adults have used training tasks that paired healthy foods with a go
response in addition to pairing unhealthy foods with a no-go
response (Adams, Lawrence, Verbruggen, & Chambers, 2017;
Lawrence et al., 2015b). It would be particularly beneficial if food
inhibition training could be used to simultaneously increase the
intake and choice of healthy foods and decrease that of unhealthy
foods in children. Furthermore, whilst previous research has
examined the effects of training on children's ad libitum intake of a
small range of energy-dense foods (often only two or three options;
Folkvord et al., 2016; Jiang et al., 2016), no studies have yet looked
at how ICT affects children's choices when faced with a wider range
of foods. Research with adults suggests that ICT can be used to in-
crease healthy (relative to unhealthy) food selection when faced
with a range of healthy and unhealthy snacks (Veling et al., 2013);
the current series of studies sets out to investigate whether ICT can
be used to increase the number of healthy snacks relative to un-
healthy chosen by children in a similar paradigm.
2. Study 1
The principal aim of this study was to determine whether ICT
can encourage healthier snack choices in primary school children.
Whilst many previous studies have demonstrated that ICT can be
used to reduce unhealthy food intake and selection in adults, the
effects of training on children's food choices has yet to be exam-
ined. In Study 1, we examined the choices children made in a hy-
pothetical shopping task after playing either an active (healthy
food ¼ go; unhealthy food ¼ stop) or a control (all foods ¼ 50% go,
50% stop) ICT task based on the Go/No-Go paradigm. This control
task is similar to that used by Houben and Jansen (2011) and was
selected on the assumption that inconsistent pairings between
each food stimulus and response type would prevent the devel-
opment of consistent stimulus-response associations whilst still
controlling for food cue exposure. In both tasks, we used happy and
sad face emoticons as the go and no-go signals, respectively. This
aspect of the training incorporated an evaluative conditioning
component and was based on previous findings that pairing
energy-dense foods with negatively valenced images reduces
favorable evaluations of such foods and encourages selections of
other
available
options
(Hensels
&
Baines,
2016;
Hollands,
Prestwich, & Marteau, 2011; Veling, Aarts, & Stroebe, 2011). As
such, the inclusion of emotive go and no-go signals has the po-
tential to strengthen training effects.
In line with findings in adults (Veling et al., 2013), we expected
children to select a greater number of healthy foods over unhealthy
snacks after playing the active game compared to the control task.
Hunger was also measured to ensure that the two groups did not
significantly differ on this measure, which has been found to affect
training effects in adults (Veling et al., 2013).
Study 1 consisted of three separate experiments following the
same one-way, between-subjects design with some minor adjust-
ments between samples (see below). Experiments were conducted
in primary schools by groups of trained undergraduate Psychology
students and the data sets from each experiment were combined in
final analyses to increase the power of the study. Experiment was
also added as a between-subjects factor to investigate whether the
effect of training on food choices differed between the three
samples.
3. Method
3.1. Participants and design
Ethical approval was obtained from the Psychology Research
Ethics Committee at the University of Exeter. Primary schools in the
Exeter area were invited to participate and consenting schools then
distributed parental consent letters. At the time of study design, no

 other studies examining the effects of ICT in children had been
published; as such we aimed for 25 participants per group within
each experiment, based on the sample size of similar studies con-
ducted in adults (Houben & Jansen, 2011). A sensitivity analysis (G-
Power 3.1.9.2) revealed that for the combined sample of all three
experiments, the minimum detectable effect size (d) for the effect
of condition on food choice would be 0.23 (alpha ¼ 0.05,
power ¼ 0.80).
Consent forms were returned for 145 children (75 female) aged
5e11 years (M ¼ 7.66, SD ¼ 1.69) from five different schools in
Devon across the three samples. The study was of a one-way, be-
tween-subjects design with children being randomly assigned to
either the active (n ¼ 73) or control condition (n ¼ 72).
3.2. Materials and measures
3.2.1. Go/No-Go training task
The task was a modified variant of the Go/No-Go task based on
the paradigm designed by Lawrence et al. (2015b). In this paradigm,
individual stimuli (food images) are presented on each trial and are
paired with either a go or a no-go signal. Participants are required
to make a motor response (key press) upon the presentation of the
go signal but to withhold this response when presented with the
no-go signal. Both the active and control task consisted of four
blocks of 32 trials. The duration of each trial was fixed at 1250 ms,
followed by an inter-trial interval of 1250 ms. At the end of each
block, accuracy (percentage) and response time (in ms) scores were
presented.
Both tasks contained the same 16 food stimuli. Half of these
(eight images) were of healthy foods (HF; e.g., apples, blueberries)
and half were of unhealthy foods (UF; e.g., chocolate buttons, crisps
e see supplementary materials). Pictures were obtained from
search engines and from the image set used by Lawrence et al.
(2015b). On each trial, a food picture was paired with a go or a
no-go signal. The go signal was one of three happy face emoticons
whilst the no-go signal was one of three sad face emoticons.
Emoticons were used as they provided a simple and intuitive rule
for children to follow (i.e., “press for foods that appear with happy
faces, don't press for foods that appear with sad faces”). The use of
emoticons as signals also added an evaluative conditioning
component to the training (whereby unhealthy foods are paired
with negative affective images and healthy foods with positive
images) to potentially strengthen training effects. Evaluative con-
ditioning has previously been shown to reduce unhealthy food
choice in adults (e.g., Hollands et al., 2011). The use of three
different go and no-go signals was based on the observation that
using multiple no-go signals increases the learning of direct
stimulus-response associations rather than stimulus-signal asso-
ciations (Best, Lawrence, Logan, McLaren, & Verbruggen, 2016;
Bowditch, Verbruggen, & McLaren, 2016).
In the active task, HF stimuli were consistently paired with go
signals and UF stimuli were consistently paired with no-go signals
(see Fig. 1); in the control task, all food stimuli were paired with
both signal types equally. Each food stimulus was presented with
two different emoticons throughout the task (i.e., two variants of
the same signal type in the active task; one of each signal type in
the control task) in order to reduce the contingency between
stimuli and specific stop signals (Best et al., 2016; Bowditch et al.,
2016). Stimuli in the control condition were automatically paired
with two different signals (one go and one no-go signal); therefore,
we ensured that food stimuli in the active task were also paired
with two different signals. Signals appeared equally in one of the
four corners of the screen near to the stimulus to encourage
attention to the entire picture frame area.
The same tasks were used for Experiments 1 and 2. Due to child
feedback, one of the go signals was changed for Experiment 3 as
children were unsure of the valence of the signal (this particular
emoticon showed lots of pointy teeth in its smile which some
participants found confusing). A pilot study on children's food
preferences before Experiment 3 also revealed that tomatoes
received very low ratings from children and so this stimulus was
replaced by an image of grapes.
3.2.2. Hunger scale
Hunger was measured using a Likert scale (9-point in Sample 1,
11-point in Samples 2 and 3; adapted from Veling et al., 2013).
Visual and descriptive aids were used along the scale with lower
numbers representing “Very Full” (happy face) and higher numbers
representing “Very Hungry” (sad face). The faces used as visual aids
were different from those used as signals during training (see
supplementary materials).
3.2.3. Food choice shopping task
Sixteen images of food were printed, laminated and cut into
separate cards (approximately 7 � 10 cm each). Half of these (eight
images) were of HF stimuli and half were of UF stimuli. Images were
sourced from internet search engines and a validated food picture
database (Blechert, Meule, Busch, & Ohla, 2014). Some of the im-
ages were of foods that had also been included in the training e in
Experiments 1 and 3, half of the food cards (eight images) were of
trained foods and half were of novel foods that had not appeared in
the Go/No-Go task whereas in Experiment 2, three-quarters of
cards (12 images) were of trained foods and one-quarter (four
images) were of novel foods.1 If cards depicted trained foods, a
different exemplar to that shown in training was used.
Cards were laid out on the desk in a random order. Children
were given one minute to pick the eight foods they would most like
to eat and put them in their shopping basket. This time limit was
imposed in order to encourage fast responding (i.e., to encourage
choices driven by reward-based impulses) and children were
warned when they only had 30 s remaining. They were also
informed that they would be given one of these foods as a reward to
take home in order to encourage valid choices (Schonberg, Bakkour,
Hover, Mumford, & Poldrack, 2014). The number of HF choices
made was covertly recorded.
3.3. Procedure
An identical procedure was followed for all three samples.
Children completed the experiment in the school environment in
small groups of 1e4 children. They were taken to a separate room
away from the rest of the class and invited to play a computer game.
Computers were placed so that children could not see the screens of
other children. They were given verbal and written instructions on
how to play the Go/No-Go task, with the training framed as an
online game in which they had to help their parents collect the
right foods for dinner. Children completed a practice block (re-
sponses not recorded) to check that they understood the task.
Children were given accuracy and reaction time (RT) feedback at
the end of the practice block and each experimental block.
Following the practice block, children completed the four blocks of
the training task, with the instructions that they should do so as
quickly and as accurately as possible.
After the training, children filled out the hunger scale. They
were then asked to play the food choice shopping game. Children
1 This minor modification was for exploratory purposes for a student project.
However, we do not focus on this in the current paper as the individual experi-
ments had small sample sizes and were relatively underpowered.

 were given their own set of food cards and a small shopping basket
to place their selections in. They completed the task separately
from the other children in the group. The experimental session
concluded with children being debriefed about the study. At the
end of the school day, children were given one of their choices from
the shopping game to take home. Children were given a HF reward
if four or more of their choices in the game were healthy. Children
who selected five or more UF choices were given one of these foods
as a reward to take home.
4. Results
The complete SPSS data file is deposited in the University of
Exeter’s data repository, Open Research Exeter (ORE).2
4.1. Preliminary analyses
Accuracy and reaction time data were checked in order to
identify participants who should be excluded on the basis of poor
performance. Exclusion criteria included average reaction times
that were greater than three standard deviations from the group
mean (no exclusions) or less than 60% overall accuracy. A fixed
criterion was used in order to avoid excluding younger age groups
based on expected lower accuracy scores for these participants. A
total of three participants were excluded on this basis, resulting in a
final sample size of 142 participants (74 female) aged 5e11
(M ¼ 7.69, SD ¼ 1.67) with 72 in the active group and 70 in the
control group.
Randomization checks investigated the distribution of age,
gender and hunger-ratings between conditions and revealed that
there were no differences in age between the active (M ¼ 7.76,
SD ¼ 1.63) and control groups (M ¼ 7.61, SD ¼ 1.73, F1,139 ¼ 0.27,
p ¼ 0.606). The groups were also well matched in terms of gender
with the active group consisting of 53% female participants
compared to 51% in the control group (c21 ¼ 0.026, p ¼ 0.872).
Similar levels of hunger were observed in the active (M ¼ 5.14,
SD ¼ 3.12) and control groups (M ¼ 5.31, SD ¼ 3.19, F1,140 ¼ 0.11,
p ¼ 0.741; see supplementary materials for a breakdown of sample
characteristics for each experiment).
4.2. Learning effects
Reaction times on HF trials (HFRT), commission errors on UF
trials (UFCE) and omission errors on HF trials (HFOE) across blocks
were examined by way of mixed-measure ANOVAs. Food-category
specific trials (as opposed to all go and no-go trials) were analyzed
in order to allow comparisons between the active and control
groups. This is because the active group participants were only
required to respond on HF trials whilst the control group partici-
pants were required to respond on both HF and UF trials. As such,
only HF go and UF no-go trials were analyzed as these are the trial
types that both groups had in common. We expected the active
group to show stronger learning and better performance overall
than the control group due to the greater predictability of re-
sponses
to
the
food
stimuli
(100%
vs.
50%
contingencies;
Verbruggen & Logan, 2008).
Due to a computer error which resulted in the loss of HF and UF
food label information, the reaction time and error data for specific
food types was lost for 11 control participants. For the following
learning data analyses therefore, a reduced control group sample
size (n ¼ 59 compared to the original n ¼ 70) was used. The total
sample size for learning effects analyses was 131 participants.
4.2.1. Healthy food reaction time
Overall, participants became faster at responding to healthy
foods as the experiment progressed (main effect of
block:
F3,387 ¼ 3.74, p ¼ 0.011, n2p ¼ 0.028; see Fig. 2). As expected, par-
ticipants in the active condition also demonstrated significantly
faster RTs (M ¼ 731.16, SE ¼ 12.33) than participants in the control
condition (M ¼ 780.82, SE ¼ 13.44, F1,129 ¼ 7.83, p ¼ 0.006,
n2p ¼ 0.057) and this was further qualified by a significant block by
condition interaction (F3, 387 ¼ 3.46, p ¼ 0.017, n2p ¼ 0.026), with
active participants showing a faster learning rate than control
participants who showed very little learning across blocks.
4.2.2. Unhealthy food commission errors
As expected, participants in the active condition showed
significantly lower commission errors on unhealthy food trials
(M ¼ 0.063, SE ¼ 0.01) compared to the control group (M ¼ 0.089,
SE ¼ 0.01, F1,129 ¼ 4.86, p ¼ 0.029, n2p ¼ 0.036). There were no other
significant effects or interactions (for the effect of block and the
interaction between block and condition, both F values < 0.889 and
p values > 0.443).

 4.2.3. Healthy food omission errors
The rate of omission errors on healthy food trials was very low
(overall M ¼ 0.08, SD ¼ 0.07). There were no significant effects of
block or condition on omission errors on healthy food trials (for the
main effects of block and condition and the interaction between the
two, F values < 1.61and p values > 0.189).
4.3. Effects of training on food choice
The data were analyzed by means of a two-way between-groups
ANOVA with condition and experiment as factors. Experiment was
added as a between-subjects factor in order to investigate whether
the specific experiment participants took part in affected the re-
sults (i.e., due to the small methodological and researcher differ-
ences). Number of HF cards chosen (out of the total of eight choices)
was entered as the dependent variable. The number of UF cards
chosen was the ‘mirror’ of the number of HF cards chosen (as these
had to add up to eight) so only HF choices were examined.
The analysis revealed a significant main effect of condition on
the number of healthy foods chosen (F1,136 ¼ 5.03, p ¼ 0.026,
n2p ¼ 0.036), with participants in the active condition choosing
significantly more healthy foods (M ¼ 4.19, SD ¼ 2.21) than par-
ticipants in the control condition (M ¼ 3.50, SD ¼ 1.78). A significant
main effect of experiment was also found (F2,136 ¼ 7.89, p ¼ 0.001,
n2p ¼ 0.104). As this effect was unexpected, Bonferroni corrected
pairwise comparisons were used to investigate the differences
between experiments. These revealed that on average, participants
in Experiment 2 chose a greater number of healthy foods (M ¼ 4.76,
SE ¼ 0.29) than participants in both Experiment 1 (M ¼ 3.24,
SE ¼ 0.26, p < 0.001) and Experiment 3 (M ¼ 3.74, SE ¼ 0.28,
p ¼ 0.038).
The interaction between condition and experiment approached
significance (F2,136 ¼ 2.94, p ¼ 0.056, n2p ¼ 0.041) (see Table 1). To
further investigate this, post-hoc t-tests were performed on each
experiment separately and sensitivity analyses were conducted to
determine the minimum detectable effect size for a two-tailed
comparison of independent means with an alpha level of 0.015
(corrected for three comparisons) and power of 0.80. For Experi-
ment 1, the minimum detectable effect size (d) was 0.92, for
Experiment 2 it was 1.04 and for Experiment 3 it was 1.01. There-
fore, these experiments were only powered to detect large effect
sizes and so any conclusions drawn upon the basis of their indi-
vidual results should be made tentatively. With a corrected critical
p value of 0.015, the t-tests revealed a significant effect of training
in Experiment 2 (t41 ¼ 2.81, p ¼ 0.008, dz ¼ 0.86) but not in
Experiment 1 (t52 ¼ 1.60, p ¼ 0.117, dz ¼ .43) or Experiment 3
(t43 ¼ �0.597, p ¼ 0.554, dz ¼ 0.18). Using the outcomes of these t-
tests, Bayesian analyses were performed using the online calculator
provided by the University of Missouri3 (Rouder, Speckman, Sun,
Morey, & Iverson, 2009) with scale r value set as default (0.707).
This calculator produces a Bayes factor and a statement of whether
or not the analysis supports the null hypothesis. Bayes factors were
compared against the table provided in the paper by Wetzels et al.
(2011). Where the calculator specifies that a Bayes factor supports
the alternative hypothesis, the factor can be compared directly to
the values in the table; where the factor is said to support the null
hypothesis, the factor must be converted first (by dividing 1 by the
calculated Bayes factor). Our Bayesian analyses revealed substantial
evidence for the alternative hypothesis in Experiment 2 only (JZS
B ¼ 6.10). Both Experiment 1 (JZS B ¼ 1.28) and Experiment 3 (JZS
B ¼ 2.93) offered anecdotal support for the null hypothesis.
We conducted one further exploratory analysis to examine
whether the age of participating children moderated the effects of
training
(i.e.,
due
to
increasing
inhibitory
control
capacity
throughout childhood; Williams, Ponesse, Schachar, Logan, &
Tannock, 1999; Best & Miller, 2010). An ANCOVA was performed

 on the overall sample that included age (mean-centred) as a co-
variate, condition as the main predictor and number of healthy
foods chosen as the outcome. The analysis revealed that whilst the
effect of condition remained significant (F1,137 ¼ 4.95, p ¼ 0.028),
neither the main effect of age nor the age by condition interaction
was significant (both p > 0.445).
5. Discussion
A combined analysis of three very similar experiments in our
first study suggests that food-related ICT has the potential to
encourage healthier food choices amongst children when they are
faced with a range of appetizing foods. Children who played an
active version of the training (healthy foods ¼ 100% go; unhealthy
foods ¼ 100% no-go) chose significantly more healthy foods (and
therefore significantly fewer unhealthy foods) than children who
played a control version of the training (both healthy and unhealthy
foods ¼ 50% go, 50% no-go). This dovetails with evidence that
children consume significantly fewer calories from energy-dense
foods after such training relative to non-food inhibition training
(Folkvord et al., 2016) and mirrors results from studies conducted
with adult participants (e.g., Veling et al., 2013). Furthermore, the
effects of training were not moderated by age, suggesting that the
training has similar effects across age groups in primary school
children.
However, when analyses were run on each experiment indi-
vidually, findings were less consistent. Experiment 2 demonstrated
a highly significant effect of training whereas neither Experiment 1
nor Experiment 3 detected such an effect. Aside from the experi-
ments being carried out by different student researchers, the
principle
methodological
difference
between
Experiment
2
compared to Experiments 1 and 3 was the proportion of novel
versus trained foods in the post-training shopping task. Specifically,
the shopping task of Experiment 2 contained more trained foods
(75% of total food cards) compared to the other two experiments
(50% of total food cards). This could indicate that training effects
may be stimulus specific, leading to an increase in healthy relative
to unhealthy food selection only when response inhibition has been
trained to the majority of energy-dense foods available. However, it
is important to note that sensitivity analyses revealed that each
experiment was only powered to detect strong effect sizes. As such,
future research is required to test this hypothesis.
The experiments in Study 1 only compared post-training dif-
ferences between groups, making it hard to draw conclusions about
how the two training tasks influenced children's food choices. A
potential issue is the possibility that the control task influenced
food choices as well. For example, inconsistent mappings between
food stimuli and go/no-go responses in the control task, coupled
with exposure to energy-dense food stimuli, may lead to increased
attention towards and intake/choice of these foods (Lawrence et al.,
2015a). This concern is reinforced by the finding that participants in
a similar inconsistent contingency control task consumed more
(numerically) than participants who were trained to always
respond to food stimuli (Houben & Jansen, 2011) and that this
difference was significant when participants were low in inhibitory
control (Houben, 2011). Alternatively, it is possible that the incon-
sistent contingencies between stimuli and responses in the control
condition may have had an inhibitory effect on children's prefer-
ence for energy-dense food. Children tend to show a preference for
energy-dense foods over healthy foods (Birch, McPhee, Steinberg, &
Sullivan,1990; Johnson, McPhee, & Birch,1991), which may elicit an
approach bias to these foods (Saunders & Robinson, 2013). Addi-
tionally, associative learning is driven by prediction error (Rescorla
& Wagner, 1972; Wasserman, Elek, Chatlosh, & Baker, 1993). It is
therefore possible that if children have a pre-existing habitual “go”
response to energy-dense foods (e.g., due to repeated exposure and
consumption cycles; Saunders & Robinson, 2013) then exposing
them to trials upon which they must inhibit this response 50% of
the time (as in the control condition) may lead to (albeit weak)
inhibitory learning by reducing this stimulus-response contin-
gency. A within-subjects analysis examining food choices both
before and after training in both groups would be better able to
detect the effects of training.
In Study 2, we therefore set out to investigate whether or not
differences in food choice between groups measured at post-
training can be explained by a change in the active group, control
group, or both. To examine potential confounds associated with the
control training condition, we also added a second control group
who received inhibition training to non-food images (as in Veling
et al., 2014; Lawrence et al., 2015b; Folkvord et al., 2016).
6. Study 2
The aim of Study 2 was to replicate the effect of training
observed in the overall sample of Study 1 and investigate whether
the control task used in Study 1 (henceforth referred to as the food
control) differentially affected children's food choices compared to
a non-food control task, as used in other studies (Folkvord et al.,
2016; Lawrence et al., 2015b; Veling et al., 2014). Study 2
compared active training to both the non-food control task and the
food control task in order to see if this latter task influences chil-
dren's food choices. Based on the finding that training effects were
(numerically) larger when the proportion of trained (versus novel)
foods in the choice task was greater than half (i.e., in Experiment 2
of Study 1), the proportion of trained to untrained foods in the
choice task for Study 2 was set to two-thirds.
We also employed a repeated-measures design that involved
testing children's food choices at two time-points; at least five days
before training and immediately after training. This enabled us to
track any changes in food choice from pre-to post-training across
the three groups and determine whether or not the results of in-
hibition training studies can be explained by changes in the active
group or confounding effects of the control task.
An additional aim of Study 2 was to investigate the similarity
between
hypothetical
measures
of
eating
behavior
(i.e.,
as
measured in Study 1) and measures of eating behavior when faced
with real foods (i.e., as in Folkvord et al., 2016). Whilst it has been
found that both food images and real foods lead to similar neural
and craving responses (Boswell & Kober, 2016), real food choices
arguably constitute a more immediate reward which may affect
behavior differentially (Appelhans, French, Pagoto, & Sherwood,
2016). Meanwhile, hypothetical measures of eating behavior are
easier to implement and pose fewer ethical challenges as they do
not involve giving children ad libitum access to energy-dense foods.
However, in order to produce meaningful and applicable results, it
is important to determine whether findings using hypothetical
tasks can be extrapolated to situations involving real food items. As
such, we provided children with both the hypothetical food choice
task from Study 1 and a real food choice task in order to determine
whether responses on each task were correlated and whether ICT
had similar effects on both hypothetical and real food choices.
7. Method
7.1. Participants and design
Participants were 91 children aged 4e11 years (M ¼ 7.53,
SD ¼ 2.11; 47 male) recruited from four primary schools within the
Exeter (Devon) and Thanet (Kent) areas. An a-priori power analysis
was conducted (G-Power 3.1.9.2) based on data from Experiment 2,
L. Porter et al. / Appetite 124 (2018) 111e123
116
 Study 1. This analysis determined that a sample size of 53 would be
sufficient to achieve statistical power of 0.80 for a study with three
groups and one covariate (pre-training choice). However, a larger
sample size was sought due to the possibility of attrition from
baseline to test and due to uncertainty regarding the effect of
training on the real food choice measure.
This study was of a one-way design with participants randomly
assigned to one of three training conditions (active vs. food control
vs. non-food control). The primary outcome measure (number of
healthy food cards chosen) was taken at two time-points (pre- and
post-training), with pre-training choice entered into between-
group analyses of post-training choice as a covariate.
7.2. Materials and measures
7.2.1. Go/No-Go task
The Go/No-Go tasks used in Study 2 were similar to those used
in Study 1 with the following alterations. All three tasks consisted
of five blocks of 32 trials. The additional block was inserted as a
practice block in order to standardize practice time and capture
early learning data. The duration of each trial was fixed at 1500 ms,
followed by an inter-trial interval of 1000 ms. At the end of each
block,
accuracy
(number
of
correct
responses)
and
average
response time (in milliseconds) were presented as feedback.
As before, stimuli in each task were 16 images, with each image
presented twice within each block. We used the go (happy emoti-
cons) and no-go signals (sad emoticons) of Experiments 1 and 2 of
Study 1. We chose to use these signals to maintain consistency with
Experiment 2, which produced the strongest training effects. The
food stimuli were altered slightly from Study 1 so that two images
of each of eight snack categories (e.g., berries, sweets e see sup-
plementary materials) made up the final 16 stimuli. These changes
were made in order to allow the training to include the foods
available in the real food choice task (detailed below). We used the
same images in both food conditions of Study 2. As before, HF
stimuli were consistently paired with go signals whilst UF stimuli
were consistently paired with no-go signals in the active condition;
in the food control condition, all images were paired equally often
with go and no-go signals. Stimuli in the non-food control consisted
of eight images of technological games equipment (e.g., head-
phones, consoles) and eight images of sports equipment (e.g., balls,
rackets). Sports stimuli were always paired with a go signal and
technology stimuli were always paired with a no-go signal (Fig. 3).
All stimuli were sourced from a food picture database (Blechert
et al., 2014), internet search engines and the researcher's own
photos.
Across all three conditions, the probability of a go signal
appearing on any given trial was equal to the probability of a no-go
signal appearing. In both the active and non-food control condi-
tions, the stimulus on a trial was entirely predictive of the response
signal type whereas stimuli in the food control condition were non-
predictive of any given signal.
7.2.2. Food choice shopping task (hypothetical choice)
The food choice task was similar to that used in Study 1, with the
exception that 12 images were presented in total (instead of 16) and
children were asked to select six foods (instead of eight). Further-
more, two different sets of cards were created so that participants
chose from a different set at each time point (pre- and post-
training). The order of presentation of these image sets was coun-
terbalanced across participants. Images were sourced from a food
picture database (Blechert et al., 2014), internet search engines and
the researcher's own photos. Half of the 12 images in each set were
HF images (e.g., apples, raspberries) and half were UF images (e.g.,
donuts, sweets; see supplementary materials). Eight of the cards in
each set (two-thirds of total; four HF, four UF) were closely matched
exemplars of foods shown in the food training tasks (e.g., apples,
sweets) whilst four cards (two HF, two UF) represented novel foods
that had not been shown in the food training. The eight cards that
depicted trained foods were very closely matched to the foods
shown in training (see supplementary materials) in order to
encourage generalization at the item-level (e.g., apple) rather than
the category-level (i.e., of healthy and unhealthy foods). This deci-
sion was made due to uncertainties regarding participants' cate-
gorization accuracy of different foods as healthy and unhealthy,
which has been found to increase throughout childhood (Nguyen,
2007). The two card sets were also matched so that they depicted
the same food categories but in a different form (e.g., green grapes
in Set 1 vs. red grapes in Set 2; see supplementary materials). Im-
ages were chosen to represent portion sizes appropriate for chil-
dren (e.g., one apple, a handful of grapes) and were depicted on a
plain white background. As in Study 1, participants were instructed
to choose foods that they wanted to eat as they would have the
opportunity to consume some of these foods later in the experi-
ment. This instruction was included to motivate children to make
ecologically valid choices.
7.2.3. Hunger scale
The same 11-point Likert scale as used in Experiments 2 and 3 of
Study 1 was used to measure hunger.
7.2.4. Real food choice task
Children were presented with six snack foods to choose from as
a participation reward. Half of these were HF (strawberries, grapes,
Fig. 3. Example screen shots from each training task.
L. Porter et al. / Appetite 124 (2018) 111e123
117
 carrots) and half were UF (chocolate buttons, marshmallows, cola-
bottle sweets). All foods had appeared in both the active and the
food control task and were presented in small Tupperware con-
tainers (capacity 250 ml) without any other packaging. Containers
were all kept full to the brim with frequent replenishing between
participants. Children were allowed to choose three items (e.g., one
grape, one chocolate button, one strawberry).
7.3. Procedure
The experiment was split into two separate phases which were
completed at least five days apart. Phase one (pre-training) was
completed in small groups of up to ten participants at a time.
Children were taken from the classroom to a separate area within
the school (e.g., reading corner) and randomly allocated to a con-
dition. Each participant was given an envelope containing the
twelve cards for the hypothetical food choice task. Children were
given alternating image sets (Set 1 or Set 2) in order to prevent
them from copying the choices of the person sitting next to them.
The children were then asked to remove their cards from the en-
velope and quickly place them facing upwards on the table in front
of them. The timer was started and children were given one minute
to choose six out of twelve foods. Afterwards, children were asked
to complete the hunger scale before being returned to the
classroom.
Children were tested individually in the second phase of the
experiment (between five and ten days later). Children were taken
from the classroom one by one and invited to play a game (the Go/
No-Go training task). The game was explained to the children and
they were told that they would get a practice round followed by
four more rounds to try and beat their score. They were invited to
start the game on the researcher's laptop whenever they were
ready by pressing the space bar. At the end of each block, the
experimenter congratulated the child on their score/reaction time
and asked them if they wanted to try and beat that score in the next
block. Immediately afterwards, the children were instructed to
complete the hypothetical food choice task for the second time
(using a different set of food images to that seen at pre-training).
Children then filled in the hunger scale. It should be noted that
the order of the hunger scale and the hypothetical food choice task
was reversed between Study 1 and Study 2; this was done in order
to ensure that training effects on hypothetical food choices (our
primary outcome measure) were not diluted by asking children to
focus on feelings of hunger.
Finally, children were offered a selection of foods as a partici-
pation reward (the real food choice task). Children were allowed to
select three items from the food selection and could either
consume them before returning to the classroom or choose to take
them home in a small bag. We used a fixed order of choice tasks
(i.e., hypothetical choice was always followed by real choice) in
order to promote ecologically valid choices on the hypothetical
choice task. This was because children were told during the hy-
pothetical choice task that they would have the opportunity to
consume some of their chosen foods at a later point in the
experiment and as such, the choice of real foods necessarily fol-
lowed this task. Another aim of this fixed order was to reinforce
the cover story that this final task was a participation reward. After
their selections had been made, children were debriefed in age
appropriate terms.

Exeter’s data repository, Open Research Exeter (ORE).2
8.1. Participants and preliminary analyses
A total of 91 children took part at both baseline and post-
training.
Exclusion
criteria
remained
the
same
as
Study
1
(average reaction times no greater than three standard deviations
from group mean; minimum accuracy 60%) and no children were
excluded on this basis. Due to a counterbalancing error, 10 children
were shown the same food card set in the pre- and post-training
shopping tasks. These children were excluded as they had not
been able to follow the planned experimental procedure, leaving a
total sample of 81 children (active n ¼ 29, food control n ¼ 25, non-
food control n ¼ 27) aged 4e11 years (M ¼ 7.54, SD ¼ 2.22; 45 male).
Six children had dietary requirements that prevented them from
taking part in the real food choice measure. A further six children
were also unable to take part in this measure due to a food spillage
on the final day of the experiment which restricted the choice of
foods available. Therefore, a reduced total of 69 children were
included in real food choice analyses (active n ¼ 25; food control
n ¼ 21; non-food control n ¼ 23).
At pre-training, four children selected five or seven (instead of
six) foods. Analyses were run both including these children (with
pre-training HF card choice expressed as a proportion of total
choices) and excluding them (with pre-training HF card choice
expressed as a quantity). The interpretation of the results was not
affected by their inclusion and so they have been included in the
final analyses unless otherwise indicated.
Randomization checks revealed that the conditions were well
matched for gender, age, pre-training hunger and pre-training HF
card choices (expressed as a proportion of total choices; Table 2).
With those participants who chose five or seven cards at pre-
training excluded and pre-training HF card choice recorded as a
quantity, the groups still did not differ significantly on this measure
(F2,74 ¼ 0.668, p ¼ 0.516).
8.2. Task performance
Overall accuracy was high with the lowest average score at 69%.
Mixed ANOVAs were used to investigate HFRT, HFOE and UFCE
across the five blocks. The non-food control task did not contain
food images and so sport image (go) trials were substituted for HF
trials and technology images (no-go) trials were substituted for UF
trials to allow a comparison of learning rates.
8.2.1. Healthy food reaction time
Mauchly's test indicated that the assumption of sphericity had
been violated for the main effect of block (c29 ¼ 53.95, p < 0.001)
and so degrees of freedom were corrected using Greenhouse-
Geisser estimates of sphericity (ε ¼ 0.71). A significant main ef-
fect of block was found (F2.847,222.04 ¼ 66.84, p < 0.001) with reac-
tion times on HF (or sport) trials improving across blocks (Fig. 4).
Training group also had a significant main effect (F2,78 ¼ 5.20,
p ¼ 0.008), with those in the food control condition demonstrating
significantly slower reaction times (M ¼ 783.67, SE ¼ 23.83) than
both the active (M ¼ 693.40, SE ¼ 22.12, p ¼ 0.007) and the non-
food control conditions (M ¼ 689.14, SE ¼ 22.93, p ¼ 0.005). The
difference between the latter two groups was not significant
(p ¼ 0.894). These main effects were qualified by a significant
interaction between block and training group (F5.69,222.04 ¼ 3.29,
p ¼ 0.005) which revealed a faster rate of learning in both the active
and non-food control groups compared to the food control group
(Fig. 4). This supports the idea that children learned the consistent
stimulus-go associations in the former two tasks but not in the
latter where stimulus-go associations were inconsistent and un-
predictable (Verbruggen & Logan, 2008).

 8.2.2. Healthy food omission errors
Mauchly's test indicated that the assumption of sphericity had
been violated for the main effect of block (c29 ¼ 100.11, p < 0.001)
and so degrees of freedom were corrected using Greenhouse-
Geisser estimates of sphericity (ε ¼ 0.58). A significant main ef-
fect of block was found (F2.32,180.58 ¼ 22.48, p < 0.001) with omission
errors on HF (or sport) trials reducing across blocks, regardless of
condition. There were no other significant effects or interactions
(for the effect of Condition and the interaction between Block and
Condition, all F values < 0.48 and all p values > 0.622).
8.2.3. Unhealthy food commission errors
A significant main effect of block was found (F4,312 ¼ 3.25,
p ¼ 0.013) with commission errors on UF (or technology) trials
reducing across blocks (Fig. 4). A significant main effect of condition
was also found (F2,78 ¼ 3.42, p ¼ 0.038) with the food control group
(M ¼ 0.107, SE ¼ 0.014) showing significantly more errors than
either the active (M ¼ 0.062, SE ¼ 0.013, p ¼ 0.022) or the non-food
control groups (M ¼ 0.063, SE ¼ 0.013, p ¼ 0.029). The difference
between these latter two groups was not significant. This supports
the idea that children learned the consistent stimulus-no-go as-
sociations in the latter two tasks but not in the former, where as-
sociations were inconsistent (Verbruggen & Logan, 2008). The
interaction between block and training group was not significant
(p ¼ 0.842).
8.3. Training effects on food choice
An ANCOVA was performed with number of HF cards chosen at
post-training as the outcome variable, condition as a between-
groups factor and pre-training HF card choice entered as a covari-
ate. Pre-training HF card choice was entered as a proportion in
order to include the four participants who chose either five or
seven (instead of six) foods in the pre-training choice task.
Pre-training HF choice had a significant main effect on post-
training HF choice (F1,77 ¼ 60.77, p < 0.001). A significant main ef-
fect of condition was also found (F2,77 ¼ 5.17, p ¼ 0.008, h2p ¼ 0.118).
Those in the active group chose significantly more HF cards (out of a
possible six; M ¼ 3.01, SE ¼ 0.20) than those in both the food control
(M ¼ 2.30, SE ¼ 0.22, p ¼ 0.012) and the non-food control groups
(M ¼ 2.15, SE ¼ 0.21, p ¼ 0.005). The difference between the two
control groups was not significant (p ¼ 0.784).
An additional analysis was run to explore whether the age of
participating children moderated the effects of training. Age and
the age by condition interaction were both added to the ANCOVA
model (with the age variable being centred before analyses). This
analysis revealed a significant main effect of condition (F2,74 ¼ 5.35,
p ¼ 0.007), pre-training healthy food choices (F1,74 ¼ 62.85,
p < 0.001) and age (F1,74 ¼ 5.77, p ¼ 0.019). However, the age by
condition interaction was not statistically significant (p ¼ 0.476).
Means were calculated to examine the change in HF card choice
(as a proportion of total choice) from pre-training to post-training.
It was found that the active group increased the proportion of HF
cards chosen from 0.36 to 0.52 (MChange active ¼ 0.161) which is equal
to a change of one additional HF card or a 44% increase in HF choice.
By contrast, the two control groups displayed a negligible change in
HF card choice as a proportion of total food choices (MChange food
control ¼ 0.031; MChange non-food control ¼ 0.035; Fig. 5), equal to a
change of 0.19 and 0.21 cards respectively. Paired samples t-tests
revealed that the change in proportion of HF cards chosen from pre-
training to post-training was significant in the active group
(t28 ¼ �4.79, p < 0.001, Cohen's dz ¼ 0.89, JSZ B ¼ 496.1) but not in
the food control (p ¼ 0.477, dz ¼ 0.14, JSZ B ¼ 3.74) or the non-food
control group (p¼.353, dz ¼ 0.18, JSZ B ¼ 3.27).

 8.4. Food choice measures: hypothetical vs. real
A correlation analysis was performed between post-training HF
card choices and real HF choices in all children. The latter measure
violated the assumption of normality due to a high number of
children choosing no healthy foods at all. This was not resolved by
transformations and therefore non-parametric Spearman's rho was
calculated. The correlation revealed a highly significant and posi-
tive relationship between the two measures (rs ¼ 0.661, p < 0.001).
8.5. Effects of training on real food choice
In order to determine whether or not real food choice was
affected by training condition, a Kruskal-Wallis test was performed
with condition as the grouping variable and real healthy food
choice as the outcome variable. The effect of condition was signif-
icant (x22 ¼ 4.76, p ¼ 0.047; one-sided test). Mann-Whitney tests
were used to carry out planned comparisons to compare the
groups. A significant difference was found between the active
group and non-food control group only (U ¼ 188.5, p ¼ 0.028).
There were no other significant comparisons between groups (for
the comparisons between the active and food control and between
the food control and the non-food control, all U values < 208.5, p >
0.204). The means showed that children in the active condition
chose the greatest number of healthy foods (M ¼ 1.00, SD ¼ 0.76)
followed by children in the food control (M ¼ 0.71, SD ¼ 0.85) and
finally by the non-food control group (M ¼ 0.52, SD ¼ 0.67).
9. Discussion
Study 2 set out to investigate whether the effects of ICT on
children's food choices are due to changes in the active condition or
control condition. In particular, the study aimed to determine
whether the food control task used in Study 1 (all foods ¼ 50% go,
50% stop) constitutes a reliable baseline control. This was achieved
by measuring hypothetical food choices both before and after
participants completed one of three training tasks (active, food
control or non-food control). Study 2 also set out to determine
whether choices made with hypothetical food cards correlated
with those made in a real food choice task in order to determine the
validity of hypothetical choice tasks.
The analyses examining the change in healthy foods chosen in a
hypothetical food choice task confirmed that the effects of ICT are
due to changes in the active condition. Children in the active group
chose a significantly greater number of healthy food cards (and
therefore, significantly fewer unhealthy food cards) compared to
children in both the food control group and the non-food control
group whilst controlling for pre-training choices. The results of
Study 1 were further replicated by the finding that age was not a
significant moderator of these training effects. Furthermore, change
data revealed that children were more likely to choose one extra
healthy food (out of a possible six foods chosen) after active
training whereas children in the two control groups did not show a
significant change in the number of healthy choices made from pre-
to post-training (note that children made their choices from a
slightly different selection of foods at pre- and post-training).
Hypothetical choices and real food choices were highly corre-
lated and training group significantly predicted real food choice.
Children in the active group chose significantly more real healthy
foods than those in the non-food (but not the food) control group.
This finding suggests that the food control task may to some extent
mask the effect of active training. Further research employing a
more continuous variable such as calorie intake is required to
determine whether or not tasks involving intermittent inhibition to
rewarding food stimuli are appropriate to use as control tasks.
It is important to note that the real food choice task may have
been less sensitive to detect training effects due to the very limited
number of choices allowed (only three small items of food). The
hypothetical task allowed children to select twice the number of
foods. In addition, other studies investigating the effect of ICT on
real eating behavior have examined effects on the quantities of
energy-dense foods eaten and have observed reductions in calories
consumed but not complete elimination of energy-dense food
intake (e.g., Folkvord et al., 2016). Furthermore, unlike the hypo-
thetical food choice measures, real food choice was only measured
at one time point. The within-subjects design of the former mea-
sure is likely to have increased our ability to detect an effect of
training on eating behavior in these earlier analyses. Nevertheless,
our findings overall revealed that the three groups showed a similar
pattern of post-training food choices regardless of the choice task
used, suggesting that the hypothetical food choice task is a valid
measure.
10. General discussion
Overall, the results of these studies suggest that food-related ICT
is a promising tool for improving the eating behaviors of children.
Children in the active condition chose significantly more healthy
foods in a hypothetical food choice task than children in both a food
control group (Studies 1 and 2) and a non-food control group
(Study 2), and the effects of training were not influenced by chil-
dren's age. This aligns with previous findings that, compared to
control participants, such training reduces energy-dense food
consumption and choice in both adults (e.g., Lawrence et al., 2015b;
Veling et al., 2013) and children (Folkvord et al., 2016; Jiang et al.,
2016). Furthermore, Study 2 contributes to the existing literature
with the finding that from pre-to post-training, children chose on
average one extra healthy food (swapping one unhealthy choice for
a healthier alternative) in a hypothetical food choice game after
active ICT but not after either control task. This is promising
considering that children currently consume too few fruits and
vegetables and too much sugar and fat (Public Health England,
2014; House of Commons Health Committee, 2015). Other find-
ings suggest that children are also likely to consume smaller por-
tions of energy-dense foods after training (Folkvord et al., 2016).
Together, these results highlight the potential of ICT as an applied

 tool for improving health outcomes amongst children within the
current nutritional climate.
A unique contribution of the current paper is the finding that
both non-food and food control paradigms failed to result in any
detectable change in hypothetical food choice from pre-to post-
training. Tasks in which energy-dense foods are associated with
inconsistent response inhibition (as in our food control task) have
been used as both control (e.g., Houben & Jansen, 2011) and active
tasks (e.g., Forman et al., 2016) although in the latter case, energy-
dense food stimuli were the only stimuli paired with inhibition,
meaning that the stimulus-response contingency was greater than
zero. Nevertheless, no studies have previously investigated the ef-
fects of this control task on changing food choices from pre-to post-
training in children or adults. Study 2 showed that hypothetical
food choices did not change significantly from pre-to post-training
in either control group, whilst a significant increase in healthy food
choice was found for the active group. However, it must be noted
that whilst the real food choices of the active group differed
significantly from the non-food control group, they were not
significantly different from the choices made in the food control
group. Future research is needed to verify whether the food control
group leads to significant changes in measures of real food con-
sumption from pre-to post-training, both in children and adult
populations.
One limitation of this study is the lack of follow up measures
after training. Currently, little is known about the endurance of ICT
effects and whether one session of training is sufficient for long-
lasting changes or whether continued practice is required. One
study with adults required participants to practice ICT four times
within one week and observed reductions in weight up to six
months later (Lawrence et al., 2015b), although individuals in this
study may have been motivated to change their eating habits and
lose weight. In order for ICT to be applied as a dietary change
intervention for children, it is imperative that the long-term effects
of training are investigated.
A further limitation of the current study is the lack of baseline
BMI and impulse control measures in the sample. Previous research
with adults has found that ICT tends to work best with those who
are more impulsive at baseline (Houben, 2011). It would be inter-
esting to see whether this effect replicates in children or whether
ICT affects the eating behavior of all children due to their generally
lower and underdeveloped inhibitory control (Bunge et al., 2002).
Furthermore, it would be important to understand whether or not
ICT can help overweight and obese children to change their dietary
choices and manage a healthier weight. The finding that ICT tends
to work best in adults with a higher BMI and a greater motivation to
consume energy-dense foods (Veling et al., 2013, 2014) suggests
that effects may be stronger in more overweight children; however
this hypothesis must be tested before ICT is offered as a clinical
intervention.
Efforts should also be made to explore the effects of training on
more ecologically valid measures of eating behavior and diet
change. Whilst the principle aim of including the real food choice
task was to explore whether choices made using hypothetical
choice tasks reflected those that would be made in the face of real
foods, it is debatable whether offering participants three small
items of food constitutes a real-life measure of food choice. Portion
size is an important contributor to obesity (e.g., Fisher, Liu, Birch, &
Rolls, 2007) and should be examined by using outcome measures
that allow children greater freedom in the selection and self-
serving of a range of foods. Finally, it is worth noting that the
hunger scale used in these experiments may be confusing for some
children. In the current studies, the researchers made every effort
to ensure that this measure was thoroughly explained to partici-
pants, however it is possible that without this guidance, the
presence of happy and sad faces along the scale may lead some
children to report a score based on their mood, rather than their
hunger. Researchers who wish to measure children's hunger should
take this into account and explore other child-friendly scales (i.e.,
that provided by Bennett & Blissett, 2014).
Future research should seek to address these issues whilst
endeavoring to deepen current understanding of training mecha-
nisms. For example, research with adult participants has indicated
that inhibiting motor responses to energy-dense foods leads to
devaluation of such stimuli (Chen et al., 2016; Veling et al., 2008)
and could also lead to the development of automatic stimulus-
response associations between No-Go foods and stopping (Veling,
Lawrence, Chen, van Koningsbruggen, & Holland, 2017). These
mechanisms were not examined here due to the time constraints of
testing within schools and have not yet been investigated in chil-
dren but they would provide a fruitful avenue for future research.
Furthermore, it is unknown whether or not the emotive Go and No-
Go signals used in the current studies strengthened training effects.
Given that research suggests that the pairing of energy-dense foods
with motor inhibition (Chen et al., 2016; Veling et al., 2008) or
negative images (Hollands et al., 2011; Veling et al., 2011) affects
food evaluations and choice, it would be interesting to see whether
combining the two approaches has an additive influence on food
choice.
To conclude, these studies indicate that ICT could be used as a
tool to encourage the choice of healthy foods such as fruit and
vegetables over energy-dense snacks. Furthermore, our results
suggest that the previously observed effects of ICT are due to pos-
itive dietary changes in the active training group rather than an
artefact of the control task used. Further work is required to
determine whether the current findings extend to real life food
choices and to everyday contexts. Nevertheless, this study supports
the potential of ICT as a future health intervention that, unlike
current educational campaigns, bypasses the need for a detailed
understanding of dietary guidelines, a strong motivation to change
and effortful self-control. It would be interesting to combine food
ICT with education and other techniques such as behavioral inhi-
bition towards real foods in a game (Jiang et al., 2016) or during
food exposure and response prevention (Boutelle & Bouton, 2015;
Jansen, Schyns, Bongers, & van den Akker, 2016) to see whether
effects of training could be further strengthened. These combined
approaches could contribute towards redressing the current un-
healthy imbalance in children's dietary intake and help to reduce
childhood obesity.
