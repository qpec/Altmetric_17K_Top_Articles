Abstract
Background: Unhealthy eating habits in adolescence lead to a wide variety of health problems and disorders. The
aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of absence of parental rules on eating and unhealthy eating behaviour
and to explore the relationships between parental rules on eating and a wide range of unhealthy eating habits of boys
and girls. We also explored the association of sociodemographic characteristics such as gender, family affluence or
parental education with eating related parental rules and eating habits of adolescents.
Methods: The data on 2765 adolescents aged 13–15 years (mean age: 14.4; 50.7 % boys) from the Slovak part of the
Health Behaviour in School-Aged Children (HBSC) study 2014 were assessed. The associations between eating-related
parental rules and unhealthy eating patterns using logistic regression were assessed using logistic regression.
Results: Unhealthy eating habits occurred frequently among adolescents (range: 18.0 % reported skipping breakfast
during weekends vs. 75.8 % for low vegetables intake). Of all adolescents, 20.5 % reported a lack of any parental rules
on eating (breakfast not mandatory, meal in front of TV allowed, no rules about sweets and soft drinks). These
adolescents were more likely to eat unhealthily, i.e. to skip breakfast on weekdays (odds ratio/95 % confidence
interval: 5.33/4.15–6.84) and on weekends (2.66/2.12–3.34), to report low consumption of fruits (1.63/1.30–2.04)
and vegetables (1.32/1.04–1.68), and the frequent consumption of sweets (1.59/1.30–1.94), soft drinks (1.93/1.56–2.38)
and energy drinks (2.15/1.72–2.70).
Conclusions: Parental rule-setting on eating is associated with eating behaviours of adolescents. Further research is
needed to disentangle causality in this relationship. If causal, parents may be targeted to modify the eating habits of
adolescents.
Background
Unhealthy eating habits have been shown to be very
common among adolescents in Europe [1–3]. Adolescents
reporting unhealthy eating habits were at increased risk of
becoming overweight [1] and suffering from fatigue, nutri-
ent deficiencies, poor cognitive or physical performance [4],
poorer mental health [5] and negative behavioural
outcomes [6]. Adolescents who develop unhealthy eat-
ing habits are likely to continue this behaviour into
adulthood [7], which can lead to a higher risk of many
chronic illnesses. It is the reason why in recent years,
particular attention has been devoted to nutritional be-
haviour during this period of life.
Parental rules have been shown to be one of the most
important factors related to eating habits among adoles-
cents [8–10]. The association between eating-related par-
ental rules and eating habits of adolescents is particularly
well-documented [10–15]. This suggests that parental

 rules on eating are a strong promoter of healthy eating
patterns among adolescents, like more consumption of
fruit and vegetables [11–14], regular consumption of
breakfast [10, 15] and less frequent soft drinks intake
[16]. The scope of the above-mentioned studies is lim-
ited in regard to specific unhealthy behaviours. There is
a lack of studies investigating the wide range of behaviours
of adolescents that contribute to the general profile of un-
healthy eating among adolescents. Moreover, evidence on
correlates of energy drink consumption, which is preva-
lent among adolescents, is scarce [17].
Several sociodemographic characteristics such as ma-
ternal education or parental modelling have previously
been identified to have strong association with eating
habits of adolescents. More specifically unhealthy eating
habits of adolescents have been shown to be more likely
in case of low maternal education, low socio-economic
status and lack of parental rules on eating [18–20]. Eating
behaviour of adolescents differed between rural and urban
areas in some European countries which can be due to cul-
tural and economic differences between rural and urban
areas [21]. Finally, girls were in general found to have a
healthier diet than boys. These gender differences in eating
habits may be explained by girls’ greater focus on healthy
eating [22].
The aim of our study was to assess the prevalence of par-
ental rules on eating and the prevalence of a wide range of
unhealthy eating behaviours among adolescents, to explore
the associations between a lack of eating-related parental
rules and various unhealthy eating habits, such as skipping
breakfast, insufficient fruits and vegetables consumption,
frequent sweets, soft drinks and energy drinks consumption
of adolescents. Moreover we explored the association of
sociodemographic characteristics such as gender, family
affluence, completeness of family, parental education and
urban context with eating related parental rules and eating
habits of adolescents.
Methods
Sample and procedure
We used data from the Health Behaviour in School-aged
Children (HBSC) study conducted in 2014 in Slovakia.
To obtain a representative sample, we used a two-step
sampling. In the first step, 151 larger and smaller elem-
entary schools located in rural as well as in urban areas
from all regions of Slovakia were asked to participate.
These were randomly selected from a list of all eligible
schools in Slovakia obtained from the Slovak Institute of
Information and Prognosis for Education. This resulted
in 130 schools agreeing to participate (86.1 %).
In the second step, we obtained data from 10,179 adoles-
cents from the 5th to 9th grades of these schools (response
rate: 78.8 %). Our final sample consisted of adolescents
who responded to questionnaires that included measures
on parental rules. In order to reduce the duration of admin-
istration of the questionnaires we used two types of ques-
tionnaire which partially consisted of the same questions.
These overlapping questions regarded the mandatory ques-
tions that have to be included in any HBSC questionnaire.
To these partially differing sets of other questions were
added, which is allowed in the HBSC design. Not all adoles-
cents administered the same version of questionnaire to
avoid that the total questionnaire would become too long.
Thus we created two different sets of questions (equal in
length, but differing in variables included) - version A and
version B with an equal share (50/50). Those version were
randomly distributed within the sample. In this way, we re-
duced the sample of adolescents, leading to a final sample
of 2765 adolescents (mean age: 14.38; 50.7 % boys).
The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the
Medical Faculty at the P.J. Safarik University in Kosice.
Parents were informed about the study via the school ad-
ministration and could opt out if they disagreed with their
child’s participation. Participation in the study was fully
voluntary and anonymous, with no explicit incentives pro-
vided for participation.
Measures
Data for the present analyses were collected using question-
naires from the standardized research protocols for the 2014
WHO-collaborative HBSC study, with the aim of gaining in-
sights into adolescents’ eating behaviour, eating-related par-
ental rules and socio-demographic characteristics. Table 1
provides an overview of the measures used in this study.
Statistical analyses
Statistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS statis-
tics 20.0 for Windows. Firstly, the prevalence of parental
rules and eating habits of adolescents were calculated for
total sample and stratified by gender and family affluence.
Differences between boys and girls and adolescents
reporting low family affluence and others were tested
using Chi-square tests. Secondly, the associations of
sociodemographic characteristics (gender, family afflu-
ence, completeness of family, parental education and
urban context) with parental rules and eating habits of
adolescents were assessed. Thirdly, we assessed the as-
sociations between eating-related parental rules and
unhealthy eating patterns using logistic regression. We
adjusted these analyses for gender and family affluence.
Results
Over 20 % of the sample reported no parental rules on
eating. Actually more than a half of adolescents admitted
the absence of one of the following rules in their families:
mandatory breakfast, meal in front of TV not allowed or
no rules about sweets and soft drinks consumption.

 adolescents varied from 18 % for skipping breakfast
during the weekends to 75 % for low vegetables con-
sumption (Table 2).
Boys were less likely to report the lack of eating related
parental rules and to skip breakfast during weekdays than
girls, but their chance to low fruit and vegetables consump-
tion, high soft drinks and energy drinks consumption was
higher than girls. Adolescents reporting low family afflu-
ence reported significantly more often the lack of parental
rules and skipping breakfast but they did not differed in the
prevalence of other unhealthy eating habits from their peers
with medium of high family affluence. Adolescents from
incomplete families were more likely to report a lack of par-
ental rules and skipping breakfast during weekdays. Adoles-
cents living in rural areas were less likely to report a lack of
parental rules and more likely to report a low fruit and high
sweets consumption, and a high soft drinks and energy
drinks consumption compared to adolescents from urban
areas. Low education of mother and father was positively
associated with a lack of parental rules, skipping breakfast,
low fruit consumption and high sweets, soft drinks, and en-
ergy drinks consumption (Table 3).
The results of the multiple logistic regressions showed
that adolescents who reported a lack of eating-related par-
ental rules were more likely to eat unhealthily . In the ana-
lyses of each eating-related rule separately, we found that
unhealthy eating habits among adolescents were associated
with an absence of these parental rules. Only low consump-
tion of fruit and vegetables showed no relationship with
some rules on eating. Adding gender and perceived family
wealth into the models did not affect the strength of the
association of rule setting on eating and the unhealthy eat-
ing habits of adolescents (Table 4). When exploring cluster-
ing by class and school, multilevel analyses showed a very
small and non-significant clustering and yielded identical or
nearly identical ORs and 95 % CIs.
Discussion
We found that more than 20 % of adolescents reported
having no parental rules on eating, and the prevalence of
unhealthy eating habits varied between 18 % for skipping
breakfast during weekends to 75 % for low consumption
of vegetables. A lack of parental rule-setting on eating
was strongly associated with unhealthy eating habits
among boys and girls. Several sociodemographic charac-
teristics such as gender, family affluence, family struc-
ture, urban context and education of parents were
related to unhealthy eating habits of adolescents and to
lack of parental rules on eating.
More than 20 % of the adolescents perceived no paren-
tal rules on eating. Previous evidence focused rather on
the association of the presence of parental rules and un-
healthy eating habits; literature dealing with the absence
of parental rules on eating is scarce. Our further findings
suggest that unhealthy eating habits, such as skipping
breakfast, low fruit and vegetable consumption, frequent
sweets, soft drinks and energy drinks consumption, were
very frequent among adolescents. Compared with the
findings of the previous HBSC survey in 2009, the preva-
lence of fruit and vegetable consumption and breakfast
skipping did not change importantly, and the prevalence
of sweets and soft drinks consumption decreased slightly

 [3]. The consumption of energy drinks among adolescents
was found to be considerably higher than existing findings
from Europe suggest [23]. The high prevalence of un-
healthy eating habits among adolescents may reflect the
limited effectiveness of preventive strategies aimed at im-
proving their eating habits. Generally, these strategies take
place in the school environment, which may be the reason
of their limited effectiveness. In line with this, Lindsay
et al. [8] highlight the success of interventions within a
variety of settings, including schools, health services and
the family setting, and emphasize the critical role of par-
ents in these interventions.
Adolescents who perceived a lack of parental rules on
eating were at higher risk to eat unhealthily. Those who
reported an absence of one of three examined parental
rules were also at risk of unhealthy eating, but the
chances were lower. Our findings confirm previous evi-
dence about the connection between parental rule-
setting on eating and unhealthy behaviour of adolescents
[11–14, 16]. In addition, the present findings suggest
that when the number of parental rules was reduced, the
prevalence of unhealthy eating behaviours increased.
Taking into account that parents have been shown to
have a crucial role in shaping their children’s dietary
practices [8, 9], our findings indicate this to be a possible
factor contributing to unhealthy eating habits among ad-
olescents. Given the cross-sectional design of present
study, the findings do not imply a causal path. An alter-
native explanation could be that having parental rules
are an expression of more general family food and eating
practices which may determine both parental rules and
eating habits of adolescents. This is definitely of interest
for further research.
Gender was found to have an important association
with eating habits of adolescents. Although boys reported
a lack of parental rules on eating less often, they were
more likely to eat unhealthily than girls. This can point at
gender differences regarding the degree of obedience of
adolescents to these rules – boys may perceive the exist-
ence of the rule but may not follow it. On the other side,
given the vulnerability of boys to eat unhealthy [3], paren-
tal rules on eating may be stricter in boys than in girls.
Our findings indicate that several sociodemographic
characteristics such as family affluence, family structure,
urban context and educational level of parents were asso-
ciated with parental rule setting on eating and also with
eating habits of adolescents. Adolescents reporting low
family affluence, incomplete family, low parental educa-
tion, living in a rural area and a lower socioeconomic sta-
tus were at higher risk of unhealthy eating habits which is
in line with previous findings [3, 24]. We explored this
relationship using several indicators related to socioeco-
nomic status (such as education of parents) to ascertain
the validity of the results.
Strengths and limitations
The major strengths of our study are its large sample and
representativeness for Slovak adolescents and its high
response rate. In addition, the measures of food consump-
tion frequency used in the present study have been well-
validated [25] and extensively used in HBSC surveys. We
studied a wide range of unhealthy eating habits in the con-
text of parental rules on eating. However, some limitations
should be also noted. Firstly, we used a cross-sectional de-
sign; thus, no final causal conclusion can be drawn. Second,
our data were based on self-reports of adolescents, which
are based on the subjective perception of the adolescent in-
cluding his or her disobedience to rules and may also be in-
fluenced by social desirability. Moreover, the measures of
parental rules were based on subjective perception which
can reflect rather the obedience degree of the adolescents
to these rules. However considerable proportion of adoles-
cents do not follow the rules which their parents apply
based on their reports, so obedience bias this measurement
only marginal. Thirdly, analyses provided in this study tar-
geted the main relationship between parental rule-setting
on eating and unhealthy eating of adolescents; we did not
address the role of biological and psycho-social factors
which can influence this relationship.
Implications
The frequent lack of parental rule-setting on eating and
the high prevalence of unhealthy eating habits among ado-
lescents indicate the need for interventions carried out in
family settings. The findings of the present study on the
connection between a lack of parental rule-setting on eat-
ing and unhealthy eating habits of adolescents suggest that
reinforcing parental rule-setting on eating may improve
adolescent eating habits especially among boys and among
adolescents with low socioeconomic status.
The associations of a lack of parental rule-setting on
eating with unhealthy eating habits of adolescents re-
quires further study to disentangle causality and the
mechanisms behind the connection between parental
rule-setting and adolescent behaviour. Longitudinal and
experimental study designs are needed for this. More-
over objective measures of eating habits (such as an-
thropometric measures, body composition or body fat)
should be explored in future research of family context
of unhealthy eating habits of adolescents.
Conclusions
This study demonstrated an association between a fre-
quent lack of parental rules on eating and the high
prevalence of a wide range of unhealthy eating habits
among boys and girls. Adolescents perceiving the lack of
parental rules on eating were at higher risk of unhealthy
eating habits. Public health strategies should address
family eating practices.
