ABSTRACT
Background: A growing number of cohort studies suggest a poten-
tial role of dairy consumption in type 2 diabetes (T2D) prevention.
The strength of this association and the amount of dairy needed is
not clear.
Objective: We performed a meta-analysis to quantify the asso-
ciations of incident T2D with dairy foods at different levels of
intake.
Design: A systematic literature search of the PubMed, Scopus,
and Embase databases (from inception to 14 April 2015) was
supplemented by hand searches of reference lists and correspon-
dence with authors of prior studies. Included were prospective
cohort studies that examined the association between dairy and
incident T2D in healthy adults. Data were extracted with the use
of a predefined protocol, with double data-entry and study qual-
ity assessments. Random-effects meta-analyses with summarized
dose-response data were performed for total, low-fat, and high-
fat dairy, (types of) milk, (types of) fermented dairy, cream, ice
cream, and sherbet. Nonlinear associations were investigated, with
data modeled with the use of spline knots and visualized via
spaghetti plots.
Results: The analysis included 22 cohort studies comprised of
579,832 individuals and 43,118 T2D cases. Total dairy was in-
versely associated with T2D risk (RR: 0.97 per 200-g/d increment;
95% CI: 0.95, 1.00; P = 0.04; I2 = 66%), with a suggestive but
similar linear inverse association noted for low-fat dairy (RR: 0.96
per 200 g/d; 95% CI: 0.92, 1.00; P = 0.072; I2 = 68%). Nonlinear
inverse associations were found for yogurt intake (at 80 g/d, RR:
0.86 compared with 0 g/d; 95% CI: 0.83, 0.90; P , 0.001; I2 =
73%) and ice cream intake (at w10 g/d, RR: 0.81; 95% CI: 0.78,
0.85; P , 0.001; I2 = 86%), but no added incremental benefits were
found at a higher intake. Other dairy types were not associated with
T2D risk.
Conclusion: This dose-response meta-analysis of observational
studies suggests a possible role for dairy foods, particularly yo-
gurt, in the prevention of T2D. Results should be considered in
the context of the observed heterogeneity.

INTRODUCTION
The prevalence of type 2 diabetes (T2D) is increasing
worldwide, from 8.3% in 2014 to an expected 10.1% (w592
million adults) in 2035 (1). T2D is considered to be a diet- and
lifestyle-related disease. Large-scale intervention studies have
demonstrated that a healthy diet and increased physical activity
reduce the risk of progression to T2D by w40% (2). An in-
creasing number of prospective cohort studies suggest a poten-
tial role of modest dairy consumption in T2D prevention.
Although meta-analyses are typically meant to be conclusive,
the widely conflicting conclusions from prior meta-analyses of
dairy and T2D (3–9) show that a more comprehensive system-
atic review is necessary, especially taking into account the po-
tential dose-dependent effects of dairy. Prior meta-analyses of
observational studies showed (nonlinear) inverse associations of
total dairy with T2D, which was mainly confined to the intake
of low-fat dairy (w10% lower risk for a 200-g daily intake) (3,
7, 9). These older meta-analyses also showed inverse associa-
tions with intake of yogurt (3, 7, 9) and cheese (3, 7), but not all
studies have agreed. On the other hand, a more recent meta-
analysis of 14 prospective studies, which included 3 large US
cohorts with 18–30 y of follow-up, conflictingly showed no
association for total dairy and T2D risk (per daily serving, RR:
0.98; 95% CI: 0.96, 1.01) (4) and also no associations for low-
fat or high-fat dairy in a separate analysis of the 3 US cohorts
(4). The meta-analysis did show, however, a significant 18%
lower risk per daily serving of yogurt (4). Recently, several new
population-based cohorts on dairy consumption and T2D have
been published (10–12). Therefore, to resolve conflicts and use
all the available data (a total of 22 prospective cohort studies)
1 This meta-analysis project on dairy products and incident diabetes was
funded by Wageningen University.

 (4, 10–28), we systematically examined a wide range of dairy
foods in relation to risk of T2D in healthy adults by means of
a comprehensive dose-response meta-analysis. This project used
approaches similar to those gained from our previously pub-
lished dairy meta-analyses with cardiovascular disease (29) and
hypertension (30) as the outcome.
METHODS
Data sources and searches
This review was conducted and reported in accordance with
the Meta-analysis Of Observational Studies in Epidemiology
guidelines (31). Two analysts (LG and SSS-M) performed a sys-
tematic literature search based on the query syntax shown in the
Supplemental Methods in the databases PubMed, Scopus, and
Embase (from inception through 14 April 2015).
Study selection
Titles, abstracts, and full texts of retrieved articles were
screened for the following predefined inclusion criteria: dairy
intake as main exposure, T2D as outcome, prospective cohort as
design, healthy adults (baseline age of $20 y), original article,
and English language. Excluded were studies in animals, chil-
dren, and ill populations. In addition, we hand-searched refer-
ence lists of identified relevant studies and of previous reviews
and meta-analyses. Of 76 fully reviewed articles, 33 articles (4,
10–28, 32–44) met the inclusion criteria (see Figure 1). Sub-
sequently, 13 articles were excluded for the following reasons:
duplicate analysis of the same study population (32–35, 38–40,
42, 43), not able to separate T2D from impaired fasting glucose
(37), data not suitable for nonlinear associations (44), and
insufficient data (36, 41). Eventually, 20 articles based on 22
different cohorts (4, 10–28), of which 2 (12, 22) were case-
cohort studies, were available for the meta-analysis. Kirii et al.
(16) presented data for men and women separately, which were
entered as 2 study populations in the meta-analysis.
Data extraction and quality assessment
Data were extracted from published articles with the use of
a predefined protocol, and double data-entry was performed.
Apart from descriptive characteristics, we extracted the fol-
lowing data for each category of dairy intake: range of intake,
median, number of subjects and T2D cases, person-years at risk,
and RR with the corresponding 95% CI. For studies that pre-
sented several multivariable-adjusted RRs, the model with the
largest number of covariates was taken. For studies not reporting
the median of each category, we took the mean of the lower and
the upper limit. When dairy intake was presented in servings or
times per day, week, or month, we converted the intake to grams
per day with the use of standard units of 177 g for total, low-fat,
and high-fat dairy; 244 g for total, low-fat, and high-fat milk
(585 g for 1 pint of milk); 244 g for yogurt; 43 g for cheese; and
25 g for cream (45, 46). When studies reported conversion
factors, these factors were applied (14, 18, 19, 28). For several
studies (13, 15, 19–22, 24) additional data were provided by the
authors or coworkers.

 There were overlapping data for 2 studies, namely, the Eu-
ropean Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition
(EPIC)–InterAct (22) and EPIC-Norfolk (12). When both stud-
ies reported on the same dairy food item, data from the EPIC-
InterAct study (22) were extracted. For dairy items not analyzed
in the EPIC-InterAct study (22), the EPIC-Norfolk (12) data
were extracted.
Two reviewers (LG and SSS-M) independently evaluated the
quality of the included studies with the use of the Newcastle-
Ottawa quality assessment scale (47). The rating system scores
studies from 0 (highest degree of bias) to 9 (lowest degree of
bias), taking into account selection, comparability, and outcome
assessment.
Data synthesis and analysis
Meta-analysis was performed when $3 cohort studies/dairy
type were available, which was the case for total dairy, low-
fat dairy, high-fat dairy, total milk, low-fat milk, high-fat
milk, cheese, yogurt, fermented dairy, cream, ice cream, and
sherbet. Linearity of associations between dairy foods and risk
of T2D were analyzed with the use of spline analysis and dose-
response (generalized least-square trend) meta-regression.
Splined variables were created with the use of MKSPLINE in
Stata version 11.0. Goodness-of-fit tests and chi-square statistics
were used to determine the most appropriate knot points and
maximal goodness of fit, to determine the best dose-response
inflection point of the nonlinear association. Linear and non-
linear associations were further analyzed with the use of dose-
response generalized least-square trend meta-regression analysis.
Random-effects meta-regression trend estimation of summarized
dose-response data, described by Greenland and Longnecker
(48), was used to derive the incremental dose-response RRs. For
linear associations, the incremental dose-response RRs were
expressed per serving size and fitted within the range of dairy
intake of all studies. For nonlinear associations, the knot points
defined these numbers. The shapes of the associations within
individual studies were visualized by means of spaghetti plots,
as described previously (49). Forest plots were made to visually
assess the linear dose-response slopes and corresponding 95%
CIs across studies (Supplemental Figures 1–12). We performed
sensitivity analysis (based on linear dose-response slopes) by
excluding one study at a time from the analyses.
To explore the presence of statistical heterogeneity, Cochran’s
Q test was conducted and the I2 statistic was calculated, repre-
senting the percentage of total variation attributable to between-
study heterogeneity (50). Subgroup analyses were performed
(based on linear dose-response slopes) by sex, age (#50, 51–60,
and .60 y), continent, follow-up duration (#5, 6–10, and .10 y),
and degree of adjustment. Subgroups for degree of adjustment
were based on whether or not studies adjusted for the major
confounders of age, sex, smoking, total energy intake, and BMI.
We performed subgroup analyses by the Newcastle-Ottawa
quality score (,7 or $7), but the subgroups were identical to
the subgroups based on degree of adjustment; therefore, we only
presented the results for the latter. Potential publication bias was
assessed by the Egger’s test (51) and by symmetry of individual
study linear dose-response slopes of the funnel plot, if $8 cohort
studies were available. Values reported in text and tables are
RRs and 95% CIs. Two-sided P values , 0.05 were considered
to be statistically significant.
RESULTS
Study characteristics
An overview of 22 prospective cohort studies based on 23
study populations (mean age .36 y), with a total of 579,832
individuals and 43,118 T2D cases, is provided in Table 1. The
sample size of the cohorts ranged from 640 to 85,884, and the
duration of follow-up ranged from 2.6 to 30 y. Nine studies were
conducted in the United States (4, 14, 17, 19, 21, 25, 26), 8 in
Europe (10–13, 20, 22–24), 3 in Asia (16, 27, 28), and 2 in
Australia (15, 18). The dairy foods studied and definitions of
dairy categories differed across studies, as described in Sup-
plemental Table 1. Total dairy consumption (based on median
intake amounts in populations) ranged from 111 to 400 g/d for
all studies combined, and from 162 to 347 g/d in the United
States, from 121 to 400 g/d in Europe, from 111 to 171 g/d in
Asia and from 266 to 347 g/d in Australia. In studies reporting
total dairy, milk made the largest contribution to total dairy
intake (range: 62–331 g of milk/d), and more low-fat dairy
(range: 65–294 g/d) than high-fat dairy (range: 17–135 g/d) was
consumed. Study characteristics by dairy type are shown in
Supplemental Table 2. The study-specific quality assessment
ratings and scores are shown in Supplemental Table 3. Total
scores ranged from 3 to 9, with 14 studies scoring $7.
Total, low-fat, and high-fat dairy and T2D
Total dairy intake (16 studies) (4, 10, 11, 13, 15–19, 22–25, 28)
was linearly associated with a 3% lower T2D risk per 200 g/
d (equal to 1.1 serving/d or 7.1 ounces/d) (RR: 0.97; 95% CI:
0.95, 1.00; P = 0.044) (Figure 2). Significant heterogeneity was
present (I2 = 66%, P , 0.001). Subgroup analyses (Supple-
mental Table 4) suggested a stronger inverse association in
Asian populations (RR: 0.85 per 200 g/d; 95% CI: 0.65, 1.12),
but no association in European populations. Also, in studies not
adjusting for the major confounders, the association tended to be
stronger (RR: 0.88 per 200 g/d; 95% CI: 0.76, 1.03). There was
no evidence of publication bias, as indicated by the funnel plot
(Supplemental Figure 13) and the Egger’s test (P = 0.11).
For low-fat dairy (13 studies) (4, 10–12, 17–19, 21, 23–25),
a borderline significant linear inverse association with T2D risk
was observed, with a 4% lower risk per 200 g/d (RR: 0.96; 95%
CI: 0.92, 1.00; P = 0.072) (Figure 3). Significant heterogeneity
was present (I2 = 68%, P , 0.001). Subgroup analyses (Sup-
plemental Table 4) indicated stronger inverse associations in
populations aged .60 y (RR: 0.84 per 200 g/d; 95% CI: 0.77,
0.93) and in studies with a follow-up of 6–10 y (RR: 0.88 per
200 g/d; 95% CI: 0.82, 0.94). There was no evidence of publi-
cation bias (Supplemental Figure 14; Egger’s test: P = 0.096).
High-fat dairy intake (13 studies) (4, 10–12, 17, 18, 20, 21,
23–25) showed no association with T2D risk (RR: 0.98 per 200
g/d; 95% CI: 0.93, 1.04; P = 0.52) (Supplemental Figure 15).
There was significant heterogeneity (I2 = 52%, P = 0.016). In
sensitivity analyses (Supplemental Table 5), excluding the
study by Ericson et al. (11) reduced I2 to 2.6% (P = 0.42), with
results remaining similar (RR: 1.01 per 200 g/d; 95% CI: 0.97,

 1.04). There was no evidence of publication bias (Supplemental
Figure 16; Egger’s test: P = 0.93).
Milk and T2D
Total milk intake (11 studies) (10, 11, 13–16, 22–24, 26, 28)
was not associated with T2D risk (RR: 0.97 per 200 g/d; 95%
CI: 0.93, 1.02; P = 0.25) (Supplemental Figure 17). Significant
heterogeneity was present (I2 = 57%, P = 0.007). Subgroup
analyses (Supplemental Table 4) suggested a direct association
(RR: 1.03 per 200 g/d; 95% CI: 1.00, 1.06) in European pop-
ulations, and an inverse association (RR: 0.87 per 200 g/d; 95%
CI: 0.72, 1.05) in Asian populations. Also, a direct association
was suggested for studies adjusting for the major confounders
(RR: 1.03 per 200 g/d; 95% CI: 1.00, 1.06), and an inverse as-
sociation for studies not adjusting for these major confounders
(RR: 0.94 per 200 g/d; 95% CI: 0.88, 1.01). There was no evi-
dence of publication bias (Supplemental Figure 18; Egger’s
test, P = 0.071).
Low-fat milk (7 studies) (4, 10, 11, 15, 17) showed no as-
sociation with T2D risk (RR: 1.01; 95% CI: 0.97, 1.05; P = 0.55)
(Supplemental Figure 19). There was significant heterogeneity
(I2 = 72%, P = 0.002). Subgroup analyses indicated a direct
association for studies with a long-term (.10 y) follow-up du-
ration (RR: 1.03 per 200 g/d; 95% CI: 1.01, 1.06) and for studies
adjusted for major confounders (RR: 1.03 per 200 g/d; 95% CI:
1.00, 1.06). An inverse association was seen for studies not
adjusting for these major confounders (RR: 0.81 per 200 g/d;
95% CI: 0.71, 0.93), although this subgroup was only based on 2
studies, and these had a short-term (#5 y) follow-up duration.
High-fat milk intake (9 studies) (4, 10, 11, 15, 17, 20, 27) was
not associated with T2D risk (RR: 0.99 per 200 g/d; 95% CI: 0.88,
1.11; P = 0.85) (Supplemental Figure 20). There was signifi-
cant heterogeneity (I2 = 84%, P , 0.001). In sensitivity analyses
(Supplemental Table 5), excluding the Asian study by Villegas
et al. (27) reduced I2 to 44% (P = 0.08), with results remaining
similar (RR: 1.04 per 200 g/d; 95% CI: 0.97, 1.10). Subgroup
analyses indicated a direct association for studies in American
populations (RR: 1.11 per 200 g/d; 95% CI: 1.03, 1.20), and
based on 2 studies in younger (#50 y) populations (RR: 1.10 per
200 g/d; 95% CI: 1.00, 1.22). There was no evidence of publi-
cation bias (Supplemental Figure 21; Egger’s test, P = 0.78).
Fermented dairy and T2D
Ericson et al. (11) reported no risk estimates for total
fermented dairy, but for low-fat and high-fat fermented dairy
separately. A meta-analysis (5 studies) (10, 11, 22–24), including
the low-fat estimate by Ericson et al. (11), showed no associa-
tion with T2D (Supplemental Figure 22A), but when the high-
fat estimate was included, a significant 12% lower risk for an
intake of 40 g/d was observed, with no further decreases at
a higher intake (Supplemental Figure 22B). Cheese (12 studies)
(4, 10, 11, 15–17, 22–24, 26) was not associated with T2D risk
(RR: 1.00 per 10 g/d; Supplemental Figure 23). Significant
heterogeneity was present (I2 = 62%, P = 0.002). In men
(Supplemental Table 4), based on 2 studies, cheese intake was
associated with a 5% higher T2D risk per 10 g/d (RR: 1.05; 95%
CI: 1.02, 1.09).

 Yogurt (11 studies) (4, 10, 11, 15–17, 19, 22, 23) was non-
linearly inversely related to T2D, showing a 14% lower risk for
an intake of 80 g/d (RR: 0.86 compared with 0 g/d; 95% CI:
0.83, 0.90; P , 0.001). The risk did not further decrease at
higher intake amounts of yogurt .80 g/d (Figure 4). There was
significant heterogeneity (I2 = 73%, P , 0.001). Subgroup analyses
(Supplemental Table 4) indicated a stronger inverse association
for studies in women (RR: 0.89 per 50 g/d; 95% CI: 0.83, 0.95),
and based on 2 studies in older (.60 y) populations (RR: 0.74
per 50 g/d; 95% CI: 0.60, 0.90). There was no evidence of
publication bias in the meta-analyses of cheese and yogurt
(Supplemental Figures 24 and 25; Egger’s test: both P . 0.15).
Other dairy foods and T2D
Cream (5 studies) (4, 11, 17) was not associated with T2D risk
(RR: 0.99 per 5 g/d) and there was no significant heterogeneity
(Supplemental Figure 26). Ice cream (5 studies) (4, 11, 17) was
significantly associated with a 19% lower T2D risk at an intake
of 10 g/d (RR: 0.81 compared with 0 g/d, 95% CI: 0.78, 0.85;
P , 0.001), with no further decrease at a higher intake (Sup-
plemental Figure 27). Significant heterogeneity (I2 = 86%, P ,
0.001) was present but could not be explored because of the
limited number of studies. Sherbet intake (4 studies) (4, 17) was
not associated with T2D risk (RR: 1.00 per 5 g/d; Supplemental
Figure 28), and there was no heterogeneity.
DISCUSSION
This dose-response meta-analysis combining data from 22
prospective cohort studies showed nonlinear inverse associations
for yogurt and ice cream intake and suggestive linear inverse
associations for total and low-fat dairy with incident T2D. Given
the considerable heterogeneity, results should be interpreted
cautiously. For high-fat dairy, milk (total, low-fat and high-
fat), cheese, cream, and sherbet intake, no significant asso-
ciations were observed.
The role of dairy foods in the prevention of diabetes received
considerable attention in meta-analyses of observational (3–9)
and intervention studies (52, 53). In our meta-analysis, a 3%

 lower T2D risk was observed per 200 g total dairy/d, which
likely was attributable to low-fat dairy (4% lower risk per 200 g/d).
Chen et al. (4) showed in their meta-analysis of 14 prospective
cohort studies no significant association for total dairy (RR: 0.98 $
serving21 $ d21; 95% CI: 0.96, 1.01), and, in a separate
analysis of 3 large US cohorts, no association for low-fat dairy
(RR: 1.00 $ serving21 $ d21; 95% CI: 0.98, 1.02). Earlier meta-
analyses showed strong inverse associations for total and low-fat
dairy (3, 7). Aune et al. (3) reported a significant 19% lower
T2D risk at a total dairy intake of 400 g/d, based on 12 studies,
with no additional benefit at a higher intake. For low-fat dairy,
based on 9 studies, a 9% lower risk per 200 g/d was found. The
lack of association in the study by Chen et al. (4) may be ex-
plained at least partly, as acknowledged by the authors, by the
longer follow-up of the 3 large US cohorts (4). In our subgroup
analysis of studies of longer duration (.10 y) we also found no
associations with total or low-fat dairy intake.
Consistent with previous meta-analyses (3, 4, 7), yogurt intake
was strongly inversely associated with incident T2D. The associ-
ation appeared to be nonlinear, with an intake of 80–125 g/d re-
lated to a 14% lower T2D risk, which is in line with the results
from Aune et al. (3). Yogurt may have contributed to our find-
ings for total dairy and low-fat dairy intake. In our meta-analysis
we had no data on the contribution of yogurt to total or low-fat
dairy, which may vary considerably across countries. In the
United States, the contribution of yogurt to total dairy based on
the NHANES study was only 3%, of which 76% was low-fat or
skimmed yogurt (54), whereas in the Spanish Prevención con
Dieta Mediterránea study, it was 24% (70% skimmed) (10).
The Prevención con Dieta Mediterránea study showed in-
verse associations for both low-fat and high-fat yogurt with
T2D (10). Yogurt may exert beneficial metabolic effects
because of probiotic bacteria, which have been reported to
lower blood cholesterol (55). Yogurt also contains vitamin
K-2 (menaquinone), which was inversely associated with the
risk of T2D in a large prospective cohort (56). Cheese,
however, is also rich in vitamin K-2 but was not related to
the risk of T2D in our meta-analysis. We could not distin-
guish between plain and sugar-sweetened yogurt, for which
intake may vary considerably across countries. The latter
could adversely affect the cardiometabolic risk profile, and
our findings may not be generalizable to all types of yogurt.
Ice cream intake was inversely associated with T2D risk,
a finding comparable with other studies (3, 4, 7). In the US
cohorts analyzed by Chen et al. (4), however, the strong inverse
association for ice cream was attenuated when dietary in-
formation was no longer updated after hypertension or hy-
percholesterolemia had been diagnosed, implying that reverse
causation may have influenced these findings. We could not
examine this source of bias in our meta-analysis. Also, the
narrow variations in ice cream intake (0–30 g/d) and the
possibility of misreporting of ice cream intake are reasons to
interpret these results with caution.
We observed no association with milk and T2DM. Findings
of previous meta-analyses (3, 7) also showed no significant
association between milk intake and the risk of T2D. In line
with our results, a very recent publication not included in our-
meta-analysis that reported on a Mendelian randomization
study indicated no evidence of an association between milk and
T2D (57).
Dairy is a heterogeneous food group with products differing in
water content, amount of fermentation, and nutrients such as fat
and sodium. A major strength of this meta-analysis is that we
examined a wide range of well-specified dairy foods in relation to
T2D risk, making use of data from 22 prospective studies. We
were able to examine dose-response relations and nonlinearity of
the associations, which could be important for setting dietary
guidelines. A limitation of this meta-analysis is that, for fer-
mented dairy, ice cream, and several other dairy products, the
variation in intake and the number of studies was small. These
results, as well as the findings from subgroup analyses, therefore
should be interpreted with caution. When evaluating data from
stratified analysis, it should be noted that factors other than the
stratifying variable may be responsible for differences across
subgroups. To illustrate, the larger risk reductions observed in
Asian populations may also be due to different amounts or types
of dairy consumed, or the confounders adjusted for in the
analysis. For our study, we extracted risk estimates from the
papers that were adjusted for the largest number of covariates.
However, a limitation of observational studies, including the
present meta-analysis, is that residual confounding (for example
by social economic status), selection bias, and information bias
cannot be ruled out.
In conclusion, this dose-response meta-analysis of prospective
cohort studies suggested an inverse association of dairy foods, in
particular yogurt, with T2D. Associations for yogurt were sup-
ported with potential biological mechanisms, and were in line
with previously published meta-analyses. However, the results
should be considered in the context of the observed heterogeneity.
The results from our updated meta-analysis imply a possible role
of dairy foods in the prevention of T2D, but this needs confir-
mation by randomized controlled trials.
