Background: Takotsubo syndrome is an increasingly recognized cause of chest pain and occasionally of
cardiogenic shock. Despite rapid improvement of the left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction, recent registry
data raise concerns about long-term prognosis. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that restora-
tion of normal ejection fraction after acute takotsubo syndrome is not equivalent to full functional recovery.
Methods: Fifty-two patients with takotsubo syndrome (according to the Mayo Clinic criteria plus cardiac mag-
netic resonance imaging to exclude myocardial infarction) and 44 healthy control subjects of the same age,
gender, and cardiovascular comorbidity distribution were prospectively recruited. The focus of the investiga-
tion was on patients with takotsubo syndrome presenting with ST-segment elevation–type electrocardio-
graphic findings or malignant arrhythmias and with LV apical ballooning variant, and a 4-month recovery
endpoint was assessed. Patients underwent echocardiographic assessment of LV myocardial deformation
(global longitudinal, radial, and circumferential strain; LV twist, torsion, and untwist; and time to peak twist
and untwist) and assessment of LV myocardial structure by pre- and post-contrast-enhanced cardiac mag-
netic resonance by T1 mapping acutely and at 4-month follow-up. Control subjects underwent a single-
time-point investigation. Data were analyzed using paired or unpaired tests, as appropriate for their distribu-
tion, and corrected for multiple comparisons.
Results: The patients’ mean age was 66 years (range, 28–87 years), and 92% were women. All abnormal echo-
cardiographic indices observed acutely in patients with takotsubo syndrome improved (but did not necessarily
normalize) at follow-up. Significant mechanotemporal alterations characterizing both systole (global longitu-
dinal strain and apical circumferential strain, P < .01 for both; LV twist, twist rate, and torsion, P < .0001 for
all) and diastole (untwist rate and time to peak untwisting, P < .001 for both) persisted at 4-month follow-up
compared with control subjects, despite normalization of LV ejection fraction and volumes. Although native
T1 (which demonstrates edema) normalized at 4-months follow-up only in segments contracting normally dur-
ing the acute phase (T1 = 1,180 6 40.6 msec [normally contracting segments, P = .20 vs control value of
1,189 6 16 msec] and T1 = 1,208 6 60.3 msec [dysfunctional segments, P < .05 vs control]), the extracellular
volume fraction (which demonstrates diffuse fibrosis) remained significantly abnormal in all LV segments
(whether normally contracting [0.328 6 0.043, P < .001] or ballooning during acute presentation
[0.320 6 0.044, P < .001], both vs control value of 0.273 6 0.045).

 Conclusions: In patients with the most clinically severe spectrum of takotsubo cardiomyopathy, regional LV sys-
tolic and diastolic deformation abnormalities persist beyond the acute event, despite normalization of global LV
ejection fraction and size. In addition, although myocardial edema partly subsides, a process of global micro-
scopic fibrosis develops in its place, detected as early as 4 months. (J Am Soc Echocardiogr 2017;-:---.)

Broken heart syndrome
Acute stress-induced (takotsubo)
cardiomyopathy
has
become
much more readily recognized in
recent years. Patients with takot-
subo
cardiomyopathy,
which
commonly masquerades as acute
myocardial infarction, often have
emotional or physical triggers and
show no evidence of a coronary
culprit or infarct-like myocardial
scar on cardiac magnetic reso-
nance
(CMR)
imaging.1
The
largest takotsubo registry in the
world as well as data from the
Swedish Cardiac Catheterisation
Laboratory Registry demonstrate
unequivocally that the medium-
and long-term prognosis is not
benign, and the mortality rate of
takotsubo syndrome is compara-
ble with that of myocardial infarc-
tion.2,3 Although this introduces a
paradigm shift in how takotsubo
syndrome’s
prognosis
was
viewed until recently, new important questions have arisen, with an
urgent need to explain why a condition considered until recently as
‘‘transient’’ and ‘‘naturally recovering’’ portends such a poor outlook. It
has become increasingly obvious that the relatively rapid recovery of
left ventricular ejection fraction (L
VEF), with or without right
ventricular ejection fraction, after an acute attack of takotsubo
cardiomyopathy is not paralleled by symptomatic4 or electrocardio-
graphic5 recovery, for example. We have previously shown that acute ta-
kotsubo hearts demonstrate severe global edema associated with
profound cardiac energetic impairment, with incomplete resolution of
both at 4 months6,7; additionally, we showed persistently abnormal
global longitudinal strain (GLS) at 3-month follow-up in a cohort of 36
patients with takotsubo cardiomyopathy comprising all comers (ST-
segment elevation, non–ST-segment elevation, normal electrocardio-
graphic results, and all left ventricular [L
V] ballooning subtypes [i.e., api-
cal, midcavity, and basal]).4 However, in a condition that shows that it is
on its way to recovery on the basis of several clear objective assessments
(normalized ejection fraction, decrease of myocardial edema), there re-
mains a disproportionately high rate of persistent symptoms, as well as
lack of return to work and physical activity, which do not appear to
improve at the same rate as the objective indices. Because edema, ener-
getic impairment, and an isolated reduction in GLS do not preclude the
coexistence or recovery of a normal resting L
VEF (which is different from
L
V performance), there must be additional pathophysiologic processes
that intervene and, if present in the long term, could begin to explain
the unexpected poor outcomes of these patients. Discrepancies in previ-
ous literature may have arisen because of a wide clinical spectrum of pa-
tients with takotsubo syndrome, variable follow-up, or both. The only
way to further test the hypothesis of remaining uncovered pathology
to explain this disproportionate persistence of symptoms relative to
apparent recovery is to focus the investigation on a homogeneous and
most clinically severe presenting spectrum of patients with takotsubo car-
diomyopathy (ST-segment elevation, malignant arrhythmias on presenta-
tion, and large, apical extending into midcavity ballooning phenotype)
and to look into all (systolic and diastolic) parameters of functional non-
recovery and mechanisms of potential longer lasting changes, such as
myocardial fibrosis. Herein, we describe the 4-months follow-up recov-
ery of L
V myocardial deformation and structure in a prospectively re-
cruited cohort of patients with takotsubo syndrome presenting with
ST-segment elevation, left bundle branch block or malignant arrhythmias
on electrocardiography, and L
V apical ballooning subtype.
METHODS
Study Subjects
Consecutive consenting patients who met the takotsubo Mayo
Clinic1 and currently updated8 criteria (pheochromocytoma and
myocarditis excluded also) and who, in addition, demonstrated no ev-
idence of late gadolinium enhancement on CMR imaging were pro-
spectively recruited at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary between 2011 and
2016. All patients were initially suspected of having myocardial infarc-
tion, and most were brought in by Scottish Ambulance Service for pri-
mary percutaneous coronary intervention. All patients had either an
emotional or no clear trigger, and we purposefully excluded patients
with other concomitant physical triggers that could have confounded
our findings; thus, patients withinfections,inflammatory conditions, or
any other concurrent physical illnesses potentially influencing myocar-
dial findings in our judgement were not included in this report. All pa-
tients underwent coronary angiography and left ventriculography and
had serial electrocardiography, 12-hour blood troponin I and brain
natriuretic peptide assessment, and comprehensive echocardiography
and contrast-enhanced CMR within 5 days of the onset of symptoms
(the mean time from symptoms onset to first echocardiographic exam-
ination was 2 days and to first CMR was 3 days). LV recovery was as-
sessed using comprehensive echocardiography and CMR at 4-month
follow-up (mean, 122 6 5 days). To account for the effect of potential
confounders, a control group of 44 subjects of similar age, gender, and
comorbidity distribution (matching hypertension) were recruited and
underwent a single-time-point echocardiographic assessment. The
study was approved by the North of Scotland Research Ethics
Committee and ran in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki,
and all subjects provided written informed consent.

 Ultrasound, Horten, Norway) by the same operator in all subjects
(J.S.). All measurements were taken from the first echocardiographic
study performed at presentation and the designated follow-up study
at 4 months. Cine loops in standard parasternal long-axis, short-axis,
and apical four-, three-, and two-chamber views were obtained at a
frame rate of $85 Hz. Short-axis views of the left ventricle were taken
at the mitral valve level (tip of the mitral valve leaflets), midventricular
level (papillary muscle), and apical level (absence of papillary mus-
cles). Three cardiac cycles in each view were obtained at end-
expiratory breath-hold and stored for offline analysis. Conventional
spectral Doppler parameters were recorded, such as early (E) and
late (A) diastolic transmitral flow velocities, isovolumic relaxation
time, and septal and lateral mitral annular early diastolic (E0), late dia-
stolic (A0), and systolic (S0) tissue velocities.
All image analysis was performed offline using EchoPAC version
1.13 (GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont, United Kingdom) by two expe-
rienced operators (A.R. and J.S.). LVEF was calculated using the
Simpson biplane method.9 Speckle-tracking strain analysis was per-
formed after manually adjusting the automatic detection of the
epicardial and endocardial borders in each view and including all
the apical myocardium (thus using an 18-segment model as opposed
to the classical 17-segment one10). The software provided segmental
and global peak longitudinal, circumferential, and radial strain, from
which GLS and basal, midcavity, and apical circumferential and radial
strain were calculated. LVrotation of the basal and apical levels (short-
axis views) was calculated as the average angular displacement be-
tween the diastolic and systolic phases of the radial lines connecting
the LV center to a specific epicardial point (Figure 1). Rotation rates
were defined as peak velocities of the respective clockwise (basal)
or anticlockwise (apical) rotations as viewed from the apex.11,12 LV
twist (in degrees) was defined as the net difference between apical
anticlockwise rotation and basal clockwise rotation. Torsion was
defined as twist normalized to the base-to-apex LV length measured
at end-diastole (in degrees per centimeter).13,14 Twist rate was
calculated as the peak velocity of twist (in degrees per scond).15
Early systolic ‘‘propping’’ twist (EST) was measured as the difference
between the initial apical and basal rotation.13 This early motion oc-
curs during isovolumic contraction and is directed clockwise at the
apex and counterclockwise at the base (thus opposite to the normal
direction of movement to follow during systole, like an athlete
throwing a discus who first turns to his right before spinning leftward
to throw); this early motion is thought to have a role in ‘‘propping’’ the
myocardium for effective systolic twist.13 Similarly, diastolic apical
and basal reverse rotation was measured as the peak clockwise and
counterclockwise diastolic reverse rotations of the LV short-axis
cross-sections, respectively. Untwist rate was determined from the
rotational rate curve as the peak of the first negative deflection
following aortic valve closure, as previously described.16 The times
to peak rotation, reverse rotation, peak twist, peak EST, and peak un-
twist were measured from the peak of the R wave. To correct for any
differences in heart rate, for all temporal analyses, the R-R interval was
normalized to 100%. The interobserver reproducibility for speckle-
tracking LV mechanics was 5 6 2% (LV twist and GLS), 6 6 2%
(EST), and 3 6 1% (untwist), each performed in n = 50 studies (20
with acute takotsubo syndrome, 20 at 4-month follow-up, and 10
control subjects by J.S. and A.R.). The intraobserver variability was
4 6 2% (LV twist and GLS), performed in all subjects included in
this study (J.S.).
A typical LV strain curve in a normal heart is shown in Figures 2A
and 2D.
Cardiac Magnetic Resonance
A 3-TAchieva scanner (Philips, Best, The Netherlands) was used for
CMR imaging. The protocol included cine imaging, early and late gad-
olinium enhancement (Gadovist 0.1 mmol/kg; Bayer Schering
Pharma, Berlin, Germany) with swap of the phase-encoding direction
and pre- and postcontrast modified Look-Locker imaging T1 map-
ping.17 Data for T1 mapping were acquired with 3(3)3(3)5 and
5(3)3 schemes for native and postcontrast T1 measurement, respec-
tively, the latter at exactly 15 min after contrast administration. All
CMR images were each analyzed by a pair of two independent expert
observers (T.A., C.S., A.R., C.J.N.) blinded to each other, to the other
imaging modality, and for T1 mapping to the order of the scan. The
CMR images were analyzed in CMR Tools (Cardiovascular Imaging
Solutions, London, United Kingdom) for computation of LV volumes
and mass. Each segment was scored for functional status (1 = normal,
2 = hypokinetic, 3 = akinetic, 4 = dyskinetic). T1 maps were gener-
ated using Philips RelaxMaps tool and quality-controlled with
goodness-of-fit maps (c2). These were imported into Segment

 (Medviso, Lund, Sweden), in which T1 values were output for each of
the 16 segments of the 17-segment model10 (omitting the true apex),
and myocardial extracellular volume (ECV) was calculated as previ-
ously described.6 Our inter- and intraobserver variabilities for all T1
mapping analysis were 2.7 6 1.5% and 1.5 6 0.5%, respectively,
and the interstudy variability for native T1 mapping in healthy volun-
teers was 2 6 0.5%.
Statistical Analysis
Data are expressed as mean 6 SD for normally distributed data and
otherwise as medians and interquartile ranges. Continuous variables
were checked for normality of distribution using the Shapiro-Wilk
test. Differences between acute presentation and follow-up data
were examined with the paired Student’s t test or Wilcoxon
matched-pairs signed rank test as appropriate. Patient data at follow-
up were compared with those of control subjects using unpaired tests
(unpaired Student’s t test or Mann-Whitney U test). Categorical vari-
ables were analyzed using c2 test or Fisher’s exact test as appropriate.
To account for multiple comparisons, the P value chosen for statistical
significance was Bonferroni-adjusted depending on the number of
variables compared between groups, after which significance was cho-
sen at P < .05. Data were analyzed using the GraphPad Prism version
5 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA) and SPSS version 24 (SPSS,
Chicago, IL). Variability was calculated as mean 6 SD of the ratios be-
tween differences and means of the two independently measured var-
iables and expressed as a percentage.
RESULTS
Demographics
Table 1 shows the patients’ and control subjects’ demographic and
general clinical characteristics. The majority (79%) presented with
chest pain, and 87% had stressful triggers. From the initial 52 acutely
presenting patients, 44 returned for follow-up. Four patients died
(two of cardiogenic shock during acute admission, one of arrhythmic
cardiac arrest, and one of subsequent suicide), and four patients un-
derwent automated implantable defibrillator or pacing device implan-
tation (one with ventricular fibrillation and long-QT syndrome, one
with asystole after direct-current cardioversion for paroxysmal atrial
fibrillation, and two with complete heart block, one of them preced-
ing the takotsubo acute event; these were excluded from imaging
follow-up because pacing is likely to affect strain data and were unsuit-
able for CMR). All medications commenced for presumed acute
myocardial infarction were stopped as soon as the diagnosis of takot-
subo cardiomyopathy was established (i.e., after coronary angiog-
raphy and CMR provided a clear-cut diagnosis). Our center’s
takotsubo management policy for the duration of this enrollment
was to not extrapolate on therapies used in other conditions with
different pathophysiology (i.e., myocardial infarction) in the absence
of any available evidence on the basis of ‘‘primum non nocere.’’
During their convalescence, patients continued only on the preexist-
ing medical therapy for any comorbidities, except if LVEF was <50%
at discharge, in which case angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors
were continued empirically. The control subjects were of the same

were on similar medications. Patients with takotsubo cardiomyopathy
had a significantly higher heart rate, both acutely and at follow-up
(P = .001 for both), although their heart rates were within normal
physiologic limits (Tables 1 and 2).

 function were abnormal upon presentation and improved significantly
at follow-up (P < .05 for all) (Table 2). There were significant abnormal-
ities at presentation compared with follow-up in LV strain (Table 3):
GLS, midcavity radial and circumferential strain, and apical radial and
circumferential strain (P < .05 all). Figure 3 shows a typical example
of changes in apical circumferential strain.
Similarly, there were significant changes in the LV twist mechanics.
First, at presentation, 26% of patients with takotsubo cardiomyopathy
lackedEST,usuallyseeninnormalhearts,whereasthislosswaslessprev-
alent at follow-up (4%). In six patients (12%) during the acute presenta-
tion, themainsystolic apicalrotationwasinverted(clockwise ratherthan
counterclockwise).Apartfromonepatient,the directionofthemainapi-
cal rotation normalized in all patients. In those with preserved direction
of apical rotation in the acute phase, the degree of rotation was reduced
(P = .029 vs follow-up), and the time to peak apical rotation was also
reduced(P=.002vsfollow-up).Althoughbasalrotationwasnotacutely
affected, time to peak basal rotation was reduced as well (P = .014).
Importantly, the magnitude of LV twist and torsion showed no
significant improvement from presentation to follow-up, although
time to peak LV twist improved. Similarly, during diastole, the untwist
rate remained severely reduced, and further, time to peak untwist re-
mained significantly delayed compared with control subjects.
LV Strain and Twist at Follow-Up versus Control Subjects
Recovery was assessed at 4-month follow-up in comparison with con-
trol subjects (Tables 2 and 3). Global LVEF and end-systolic volume
improved (P < .0001 by both echocardiography and CMR) and
normalized in all but two patients. Despite the ‘‘normal LVEF,’’ subtle
persistent wall motion abnormalities remained visible in 26 patients
and were all confined to the territories affected during the acute phase.
These subtle wall motion abnormalities were unlike the classical
reduction in wall thickening seen in ischemic myocardium but were
best seen as a reduction in the counterclockwise rotation of the apical
short axis (which contributes to the heart’s effective twist) or a slight
delay in systolic contraction of some of the apical segments in long-

cantly different from those in control subjects, although there was a
trend toward a delayed isovolumic relaxation time (P = .07) in patients
with takotsubo cardiomyopathy. LV strain indices showed persistently
impaired GLS and apical circumferential strain (P < .01 for both).
Apical and basal rotation, their rates, and times to peak all improved
and were nonsignificantly different from control subjects at follow-
up, but their overall contribution was not enough to restore LV twist
and torsion to normal values, which remained significantly impaired
at follow-up compared with control subjects (P < .01 for both). The
same was observed for time to peak EST, which remained significantly
prolonged in the convalescent patients with takotsubo syndrome
(P = .01). These systolic alterations were accompanied by residual dia-
stolic abnormalities (i.e., reduced untwist rate and prolonged time to
peak untwist rate in convalescent patients with takotsubo syndrome
compared with control subjects; P < .01 for both). Figure 2 shows
LV twist and untwist and rotational rates alterations seen in a typical
patient with takotsubo syndrome acutely (Figures 2B and 2E) and at
follow-up (Figures 2Cand 2F) compared with anormal control subject
(Figures 2A and 2C). Importantly, there were no significant differences
in any of the systolic or diastolic strain parameters between those pa-
tients with and those without visual wall motion abnormalities, under-
scoring the fact that these changes are subtle and poorly detected by
the human eye above a certain threshold.
Myocardial Structure by CMR and T1 Mapping
CMR characteristics are shown in Table 2 and demonstrated a reduc-
tion in LV mass at follow-up (P < .001). Figure 4 demonstrates that sig-
nificant increases in both native T1 and ECV values were seen acutely
in both normally contracting and dysfunctional segments compared
with control subjects: T1 = 1,238 6 64.5 and 1,292 6 80.6 msec
(normal and dysfunctional) versus 1,189 6 16 msec (control)
(P < .001 for both) and ECV = 0.327 6 0.038 and 0.326 6 0.040

(P < .001 for both). Although native T1 normalized only in
previously normally contracting segments at 4-month follow-up
(T1 = 1,180 6 40.6 msec [normal, P = .2 vs control] and
T1 = 1,208 6 60.3 msec [dysfunctional, P < .05 vs control]), ECVre-
mained significantly abnormal in all LV segments (whether normally
contracting [0.328 6 0.043, P < .001] or ballooning during acute pre-
sentation [0.320 6 0.044, P < .001], both vs control).

 electrocardiographic findings or malignant arrhythmias and with the
apical ballooning phenotype. This cohort was prospectively recruited,
is the largest of its kind undergoing this analysis to date, was matched
to control subjects, and included male patients. The main findings of
this study, incremental to previous reports, are as follows:
� Significant alterations in cardiac deformation, timing, and rates of contraction
and relaxation persisted at 4-month follow-up after takotsubo cardiomyopa-
thy compared with control subjects, despite normalization of LVejection frac-
tion and volumes (systole: GLS, apical circumferential strain, LV twist, twist
rate, and torsion; diastole: untwist rate and time to peak untwisting).
� After an acute takotsubo episode, although myocardial edema partly sub-
sides, a process of global microscopic fibrosis develops in its place, detected
as early as 4 months.
Present Results in the Context of Previous Literature
Previous studies are at variance regarding the recovery in regional LV
strain at early follow-up (1 month), with one study reporting persis-
tence of postsystolic shortening18 and another study highlighting that
patients with ST-segment elevation–type presentation may have de-
layed recovery, especially of diastolic function.16 Both of these case-
control studies found an overwhelming improvement in most param-
eters studied. However, in a separate, earlier cohort of patients, we
documented reduced GLS 3 months after the acute phase (a finding
replicated by others at 21-day follow-up19), associated with incomplete
resolution of symptoms in a large proportion of patients with takotsubo
syndrome.4 In further separate takotsubo cohorts, we previously
described additional persistent abnormalities, such as elevated

 natriuretic peptide concentrations at 3 months, persistent myocardial
edema at 3 months,20 and impaired myocardial energetic status
(together with persistence of edema) at 4-month follow-up.7 These
objective abnormalities indicate that complete recovery in these pa-
tients may not occur as rapidly as previously thought and together
with the persistent symptoms that we consistently observed during
the clinical follow-up of these patients prompted us to reevaluate car-
diac mechanics. A longer convalescent period or incomplete recovery
after an acute takotsubo episode would better explain the recent regis-
tries’ data, which place the long-term prognosis of takotsubo cardiomy-
opathy at a comparable level of that of myocardial infarction.2,3,21
Furthermore, the apical ballooning subtype of takotsubo syndrome
studied here has been recently shown to have the least favorable
outcome of all takotsubo variants.22 Indeed, in the present study,
focused on the ‘‘apical ballooning’’ phenotype, presenting with either
ST-segment elevation electrocardiographic findings, left bundle branch
block, or malignant arrhythmias (thus defining a more severe clinical
presenting spectrum), we demonstrate lack of recovery for several
indices of systolic and diastolic performance, over and above the iso-
lated finding of persistently abnormal GLS alone reported in previous
studies inclusive of all comers.4 Therefore, our study provides an impor-
tant mechanistic explanation to support these large outcome studies.
This is the first study to examine the architectural recovery of the LV
myocardium after a takotsubo event, using contrast-enhanced CMR.
The increased LV mass23 is presumably a reflection of the significant
myocardial edemaseenin themyocardium duringtheacutestage,pre-
viously reported by us and others.7,20,24 There is extensive evidence
that precontrast T1 mapping is reflective of edema, previously
provided by our group25 and by others.26-28 Here we replicate our
previous findings7 showing that LV edema subsides in the previously
well-contracting segments. However, despite a significant decrease
by 4 months after acute presentation, edema persists to a mild degree
in the previously dysfunctional segments, in which precontrast T1
mapping values remain significantly elevated compared with a group
of control subjects matched for age, gender, and hypertensive comor-
bidity. We also show that the extracellular component within the LV
myocardium(expressedasapercentage ofLVmass)is elevatedacutely
and remains at similar level at 4-month follow-up. Because the extent
and severity of edema subsides during this time, it follows that some-
thing else must take its place: we believe that given that the ECV values
do not change, this must reflect deposition of microscopic fibrosis that
develops during the convalescent phase.
Unique Characteristics of Our Cohort
Several characteristics make the present study unique and bring
added value to the currently published literature in this condition.
First, it included a larger number of patients (this time including
male patients as well) who are of a homogeneous, most clinically se-
vere spectrum of takotsubo presentation. Second, our patients were
not on b-blockers at follow-up, which is a unique cohort relative to
the significant clinical equipoise present worldwide. Third, our control
subjects were matched for cardiac comorbidities (mostly history of
hypertension). The latter two characteristics eliminate important con-
founders in assessing LV strain and twist mechanics, which are known
to be affected by inotropic therapy29-33 and LV afterload.34,35
Importance and Extent of Systolic, Diastolic, and
Extracellular Matrix Abnormalities
The alterations in LV twist mechanics were seen both as reduced me-
chanical performance (reduced strain and twist) and as significant
shifts in the timing of events. First, the systolic changes span from a
complete disappearance of EST (which is a novel finding) to a reduc-
tion in LV rotation that paradoxically peaks earlier than normal,
further on to a complete reversal of rotational direction. It is not clear
if these alterations carry different prognostic implications. The earlier
occurrence of peak rotating motion may reflect blunting of overall
contraction or may represent an adaptive mechanism to the reduc-
tion in global longitudinal function (most marked during the acute
phase). Importantly, these alterations result in an ineffective LV twist,
which remains abnormal in the convalescent phase at 4 months and
matches findings of impaired longitudinal and apical circumferential
strain.
The diastolic abnormalities were equally striking: in both acute and
convalescent takotsubo cardiomyopathy, we found a reduced un-
twisting rate that peaked late during diastole (on average by
20–60 msec compared with control subjects). These abnormalities
are likely to lead to alterations in diastolic function and filling.
Importantly, this reduced ability of the myocardium to relax persisted
at 4-month follow-up, despite normalization of global functional pa-
rameters (LVEF, mitral annular S0, E0, and E/E0), and is a novel finding
of this study. Moreover, they make it unlikely that the acute findings
are due to the Q-T prolongation seen acutely in this condition,
because the Q-T interval recovered in all patients at 4-month
follow-up (data not shown). It is surprising therefore that classical pa-
rameters such as E0 and E/E0 were no longer different at follow-up
compared with control subjects. Perhaps the explanation lies in the
fact that the alterations seen in takotsubo syndrome are more subtle
or of a different nature compared with other cardiomyopathies.
Indeed, these mechanotemporal alterations in the convalescent takot-
subo hearts are present despite an apparent preservation of LV geom-
etry, as none of the patients included in this study showed any
evidence of macroscopic fibrosis (scar) on CMR. Although these find-
ings were observed using resting echocardiography, it is not known
how these parameters would change with exercise, but it is conceiv-
able that they provide at least a partial explanation for recent reports
of fatigue and inability to engage in physical exercise in these pa-
tients.4 The patients with takotsubo syndrome in this study appeared
to sustain relative resting tachycardia compared with control subjects.
There are at least two possible explanations: given the mechanotem-
poral disruption of LV mechanics, the higher heart rate may represent
a compensatory mechanism for maintaining effective cardiac output.
Another possibility is that these patients may have associated auto-
nomic dysfunction, with parasympathetic failure, as recently sug-
gested,36 or the two conditions may coexist. This is an important
balance to establish with respect to guiding future therapies, because
in one instance b-blockers may be useful, whereas in the other they
may be harmful in counteracting an adaptive mechanism.
The ECV values in themselves are comparable with those reported
in other heart conditions, such as postmyocarditis, cardiomyopathies,
and diabetic heart, and thus it is unlikely that ECV would have any
quantitative value in differentiating the post-takotsubo heart from
other conditions.37,38 The real significance of our findings is the
striking lack of return to a normal myocardial structure in a
condition considered until recently as ‘‘a fully reversible form of
acute cardiomyopathy.’’
Finally, our findings raise the need for longer term studies. They
also may have implications for functional recovery (e.g., exercise ca-
pacity and the possibility that these patients are candidates for devel-
oping heart failure with preserved ejection fraction) and for the
development of effective therapy: if a process of myocardial fibrosis
persists after takotsubo cardiomyopathy, then the case for specific

 disease-modifying therapy to prevent long-term damage is strength-
ened. Alternatively, antifibrotic therapies could be considered in
future studies to explore if the medium- and long-term prognosis of
these patients may be improved by such interventions.
CONCLUSIONS
We demonstrate persistence of subtle LV systolic and diastolic abnor-
malities at 4-month follow-up in the most severe spectrum of acute
stress-induced
(takotsubo)
cardiomyopathy,
despite
apparent
normalization of LVEF, compared with control subjects of similar
age, gender, and comorbidity distribution. In addition, although
myocardial edema partly subsides, a process of global microscopic
fibrosis develops in its place, detected as early as 4 months. This sug-
gests either a longer recovery phase in this group or that this condition
may not be fully reversible, as previously thought. This is important in
the context of therapy decision making acutely and beyond the initial
period of LVEF recovery. Studies investigating potential therapies are
needed.
