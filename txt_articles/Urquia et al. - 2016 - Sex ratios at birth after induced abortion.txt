T
he natural odds of having a male child 
— the male:female ratio at birth — is 
relatively stable across human popula-
tions.1,2 It ranges between 1.03 and 1.07 males 
per female, and is largely independent of birth 
order and the sex of previous siblings.2,3 Modest 
variations in the natural male:female ratio have 
been linked to demographic, biologic and envi-
ronmental factors,2,4–6 including wartime and 
environmental disasters.7–9
In certain Asian countries, a higher-than-
expected male:female ratio at birth is thought to 
be a product of sex discrimination fuelled by 
the preference for sons. This preference has 
been attributed to various economic and cul-
tural factors, including provision of financial 
support in old age, the burden of dowry pay-
ments and worship duties in India,10,11 patrilin-
eal lineage in China and India, and the 1-child 
policy in China.10 One major mechanism 
behind skewed male:female infant ratios is 
thought to be induced abortion of female 
fetuses identified on early prenatal ultrasonog-
raphy, particularly among couples with 2 prior 
daughters. Differing male:female infant ratios 
may also be explained by differential use of 
pre- and postfertilization techniques,12 bias in 
the reporting of live births13 and sex-selective 
postnatal infanticide.14 The body of literature to 
date reflects mostly indirect evidence obtained 
by rough measurement of male:female ratios at 
birth in India,15–17 China,13,18,19 Vietnam20,21 and 
the rest of Asia.22–25 Prior studies of this phe-
nomenon in industrialized countries have 
looked at maternal country of origin broadly 
but have observed it predominantly among 
Asian immigrants from countries where male-
biased infant sex ratios have been extensively 
documented.10,26–30 Data on the relation between 
abortion practices and male:female infant ratios 
are lacking.
Although prenatal sex selection is thought to 
occur within certain Asian countries (e.g., 
India),31 differing approaches to interpretation 
of sex ratios at birth has led to some contro-
versy regarding its practice in North America

Background: Skewed male:female ratios at birth 
have been observed among certain immigrant 
groups. Data on abortion practices that might 
help to explain these findings are lacking.
Methods: We examined 1 220 933 births to 
women with up to 3 consecutive singleton live 
births between 1993 and 2012 in Ontario. 
Records of live births, and induced and sponta-
neous abortions were linked to Canadian immi-
gration records. We determined associations of 
male:female infant ratios with maternal birth-
place, sex of the previous living sibling(s) and 
prior spontaneous or induced abortions.
Results: Male:female infant ratios did not 
appreciably depart from the normal range 
among Canadian-born women and most 
women born outside of Canada, irrespective 
of the sex of previous children or the charac-
teristics of prior abortions. However, among 
infants of women who immigrated from India 
and had previously given birth to 2 girls, the 
overall male:female ratio was 1.96 (95% confi-
dence interval [CI] 1.75–2.21) for the third live 
birth. The male:female infant ratio after 2 
girls was 1.77 (95% CI 1.26–2.47) times higher 
if the current birth was preceded by 1 induced 
abortion, 2.38 (95% CI 1.44–3.94) times higher 
if preceded by 2 or more induced abortions 
and 3.88 (95% CI 2.02–7.50) times higher if 
the induced abortion was performed at 
15 weeks or more gestation relative to no pre-
ceding abortion. Spontaneous abortions were 
not associated with male-biased sex ratios in 
subsequent births.
Interpretation: High male:female ratios 
observed among infants born to women who 
immigrated from India are associated with 
induced abortions, especially in the second tri-
mester of pregnancy.

and the United Kingdom.32–34 Published studies 
rarely considered the sex of the previous sib-
lings — a key determinant of subsequent fertil-
ity decisions35 — nor did they distinguish 
between women who had induced abortions 
following live births from those who had not.
We studied the male:female ratios of liveborn 
children in Ontario, where induced abortions are 
both legal and free. Our objective was to evaluate 
the male:female ratio at birth in relation to the 
mother’s country of birth, the sex and birth order 
of her children, and the type, number and timing 
of any abortions she had between live births.
Methods
Study setting and participants
The eligible study population comprised all sin-
gleton live births to women residing in Ontario 
at the time of delivery who had a valid Ontario 
health card number. The study sample was 
retrieved from population-based administrative 
databases linked at the Institute for Clinical 
Evaluative Sciences (Toronto) and restricted to 
women who had up to 3 consecutive singleton 
live births in Ontario hospitals starting Apr. 1, 
1993, of which at least 1 live birth occurred 
between Apr. 1, 2002, and Mar. 31, 2012. The 
latter is required because all previous live births 
would have been reported in the obstetrical 
delivery record since Apr. 1, 2002, and this 
number had to agree with the historical count of 
liveborn deliveries to the same mother to accu-
rately measure live-birth order. If the 2 num-
bers differed, we excluded these women and all 
of their births to avoid including women with 
incomplete reproductive history. We also 
excluded births for which sex of the infant was 
unknown, fourth- or higher-order live births 
that resulted in sparse data, women whose first 
birth was before April 1993 and women whose 
country of birth could not be determined.
Variable definitions and data sources
We defined birth order as the complete sequence 
of up to 3 consecutive live births from the same 
mother. We updated birth order at each subse-
quent live birth by removing prior siblings who 
were no longer alive by the estimated conception 
date of the current live birth, based on the 
assumption that fertility decisions are based on the 
number and sex of the children currently alive. 
Alive status was assessed via a linkage with the 
death database of the Ontario Office of the Regis-
trar General, complemented by in-hospital deaths.
We ascertained maternal birthplace through 
the Citizenship and Immigration Canada perma-
nent resident database, which has the immigra-
tion records of all individuals granted permanent 
residency in Canada since January 1985. The 
immigration database is linked with the Ontario 
Registered Persons Database, a registry that con-
tains the unique health numbers that have been 
issued to individuals eligible for coverage under 
the Ontario Health Insurance Plan (OHIP). 
About 90% of individuals in the immigration 
database were matched to a resident of Ontario 
with a valid health card number. Unmatched 
immigrants may have moved out of Ontario or 
may have been misclassified as nonimmigrants. 
Sociodemographic characteristics did not signifi-
cantly differ between matched and unmatched 
individuals, suggesting little, if any, selection 
bias among immigrants.36 We assigned 6 groups 
by maternal birthplace: born in Canada (group 
contains a small proportion of immigrant resi-
dents who could not be matched to the immigra-
tion registry or who immigrated before 1985), 
immigrants from India, immigrants from China 
(including Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan), 
immigrants from other South Asian countries 
(Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Pakistan), 
immigrants from other Asian countries (Iran, 
Nepal, Bhutan, Maldives, Vietnam, Philippines, 
Indonesia, Cambodia, Thailand, Singapore, 
Myanmar, Lao People’s Democratic Republic, 
Brunei Darussalam, Timor-Leste and Malaysia) 
and immigrants from the rest of the world.
We defined induced abortions as any surgi-
cal or medication-induced termination of preg-
nancy. If 2 consecutive abortions were recorded 
within 40 days of each other, they were consid-
ered the same event, and the date of the first 
abortion was used. Induced abortions per-
formed in a hospital acute care, day surgery or 
emergency department setting were captured in 
the Discharge Abstracts Database, Same-Day-
Surgery Database and the National Ambulatory 
Care Reporting System of the Canadian Insti-
tute for Health Information, under mandatory 
reporting requirements. To be considered an 
induced abortion, a record must have had a pro-
cedure code for a termination of pregnancy 
without a concomitant diagnostic code for a 
spontaneous abortion (Appendix 1, available 
at www.cmaj.ca/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1503/
cmaj.151074/-/DC1). Abortions performed 
out of hospital were captured using the OHIP 
physician billing codes for a surgical induced 
abortion. An induced abortion was classified 
according to whether it was performed at less 
than 15 weeks or at 15 weeks or more gesta-
tion, based on fee codes S752 and S785, 
respectively. Terminations at 15 weeks or more 
are only eligible for payment if gestational age 
is confirmed by ultrasonography.

Statistical analysis
The male:female ratio is a particular example of 
the odds [Pmale/(1 – Pmale)], expressed herein as 
the proportion of males divided by the propor-
tion of females,  at the current (index) delivery. 
Therefore, to calculate male:female infant 
ratios (i.e., the odds of a liveborn child being 
male rather than female) we used intercept-only 
logistic regression models, with 95% confi-
dence intervals (CIs), within each stratum of 
maternal birthplace and sex of the previous 
sibling(s). We also used logistic regression to 
assess if male:female ratios in the current birth 
differed according to the type of abortion (none 
[referent], spontaneous, induced), an increasing 
number of induced abortions (none [referent], 
one, 2 or more) and the timing of abortions 
(none [referent], < 15 weeks gestation, ≥ 15 
weeks gestation) performed during the interval 
between the previous and current (index) live-
born child. For these models, we calculated 
odds ratios (ORs) (i.e., the ratio of 2 odds or 2 
male:female ratios). To account for small cell 
sizes at the third live birth, we used exact meth-
ods. To test for trend, the number and timing of 
abortions were also entered as a linear term in 
the models.
In models restricted to women born in Can-
ada, we adjusted for maternal age and neigh-
bourhood income quintiles. In models restricted 
to immigrants, we further adjusted for maternal 
education at arrival, marital status at arrival and 
duration of residence in Canada, because these 
characteristics were only available in the immi-
gration registry. For analyses assessing differ-
ences in length of interval between the second 
and third live birth, we adjusted for the number 
of spontaneous abortions within that time inter-
val. We analyzed the data using SAS version 
9.3 (SAS Institute).
The study was approved by the St. Michael’s 
Hospital and Sunnybrook Health Sciences Cen-
tre Research Ethics Board (Toronto).
Results
There were 1 310 881 live births to women with 
a complete reproductive history. We sequen-
tially excluded 27 171 births without known 
infant sex, 34 567 fourth- or higher-order births, 
18 710 births to mothers whose first recorded 
birth in Ontario occurred before 1993 and 9500 
births to women with unknown country of birth. 
The final study sample comprised 1 220 933 
live births, including 153 829 (12.6%) to 
women who had immigrated from Asia.
As expected, the number of live births 
declined with increasing birth order among all 
groups, but it varied according to the sex of the 
previous sibling(s) (Table 1). Women who had 
immigrated from India and who gave birth to a 
third child were 2.9 times more likely to have 
previously given birth to 2 females rather than 
2 males (1262 v. 439 newborns). Similarly, but 
to a less pronounced degree, women who immi-
grated from China and who had a third child 
were 1.5 times more likely to have 2 previous 
females than 2 males (396 v. 262 newborns). 
These differences were not seen among women 
from other countries or among women born in 
Canada. With the exception of women who 
immigrated from India, there were fewer third 
births among women who had 2 previous chil-
dren of different sexes (Table 1).
For most groups, male:female infant ratios 
showed little variation according to maternal 
birthplace and sex of the previous sibling(s). The 
exception was among women who immigrated 
from India (male:female ratio at the third birth 
1.96, 95% CI 1.75 to 2.21 after 2 girls) (Table 1). 
The effect was most pronounced among women 
who immigrated from India with 2 previous girls 
followed by 1 or more induced abortions 
(male:female ratio 3.26, 95% CI 2.53 to 4.21), 
and less pronounced among those who did not 
have a recorded induced abortion after 2 girls 
(male:female ratio 1.68, 95% CI 1.47 to 1.91). 
Other than in immigrants from India, further 
analyses did not reveal any association between 
male sex in the current birth and abortion history 
(Appendix 2, available at www.cmaj.ca/lookup/
suppl/doi:10.1503/cmaj.151074/-/DC1). There-
fore, the analyses that follow were limited to a 
comparison of women born in India and women 
born in Canada.
The male:female ratio for the third live birth 
was 1.91 (95% CI 1.42 to 2.57) times higher 
following 1 or more induced abortions after the 
birth of 2 females among women born in India 
compared with those who did not undergo an 
induced abortion between the second and third 
birth (Figure 1). However, having had a sponta-
neous abortion since the previous live birth was 
not significantly associated with male sex of the 
current live birth, at any level of birth order or 
sex of the previous sibling(s).
The male:female ratio for the third live birth 
showed a dose–response relation among 
women born in India, by the number of induced 
abortions performed after the birth of 2 girls 
(p [for trend] < 0.001) and the birth of 2 boys 
(p [for trend] = 0.03) (Figure 2).
Among women born in India, we also found a 
dose–response relation between male sex and the 
timing of the induced abortion after having 1 girl 
(p [for trend] = 0.04) and after having 2 girls (p [for

trend] < 0.001) (Figure 3). For all third births, com-
pared with those not preceded by an induced abor-
tion, the male:female ratio was 1.62 (95% CI 1.18 
to 2.22) times higher if preceded by at least 1 abor-
tion before 15 weeks gestation and 3.88 (95% CI 
2.02 to 7.50) times higher if preceded by 1 or more

abortions at 15 weeks or more gestation. After giv-
ing birth to 2 males, an induced abortion at 
15 weeks or more gestation among women born in 
India was so uncommon that data suppression was 
required because of the small counts (Figure 3).
We found the longest interval between the 
birth of a second and third child among women 
born in India, particularly those who had previ-
ously given birth to 2 girls. Among the latter, 
the birth interval was 3.8 (95% CI 0.9 to 6.7) 
months longer if the third live birth was a male 
(mean interval = 49.0 mo) rather than a female 
(mean interval = 45.4 mo), after we adjusted for 
the number of spontaneous abortions (Table 2).

Interpretation
Our findings show that, among some immi-
grants from India, prior induced abortion is 
associated with subsequently giving birth to a 
boy, especially at the third birth and among 
women who had given birth to 2 previous girls. 
Our findings also provide details about specific 
factors associated with this practice. First, pref-
erence for sons can be inferred by the fact that 
the number of third-order births, irrespective of 
sex, was 3 times more common among mothers 
born in India who had 2 previous girls than 
among mothers born in India with 2 previous

also highest among women born in India with 2

much more likely to be a boy after an induced 
abortion but not after a spontaneous abortion. 
The link with newborn male sex was stronger 
for births to women born in India who had 2 
previous daughters, with a dose–response asso-
ciation observed by the number of induced abor-
tions and the timing at which they were per-

can be accurately determined by ultrasonogra-
phy.37 Finally, there was an average lag time of 
3.8 months (i.e., 15.2 wk) to the birth of the 
third child if that child was a boy rather than a 
girl, which could suggest that a procedure or 
process had taken place during this longer inter-
val.
In our study, prior to the live birth of a third 
child, one-quarter of women born in India who 
had previously given birth to 2 daughters under-
went at least 1 induced abortion, and one-third of 
them underwent repeated induced abortions during 
that interim. These proportions likely underesti-
mate the potential risk that a woman born in India 
will undergo an induced abortion after 2 daughters, 
because the natural probability of the next child 
being male is about 51%, which is independent of 
the sex of the previous sibling(s). Multiple induced 
abortions have been shown to be detrimental to a 
woman’s health and also to a subsequent preg-
nancy.38 In our study, we found that, among some 
women born in India, multiple induced abortions 
were performed in the short interval that elapsed 
between 2 consecutive live births.
Our observed male:female infant ratio of 1.96 
among women born in India with 2 previous 
daughters is higher than the ratio that was 
reported in a study based on household survey 
data from India (male:female ratio 1.44).15 One 
possible explanation is that immigrants from 
India living in Ontario may not be representative 
of the population of India as a whole. Differences 
in study designs may be another explanation. 
Nevertheless, migration to Canada from India has 
not been accompanied by an appreciable reduc-
tion in the elevated male:female infant ratio.
Among other immigrants from Asia, there 
was little variation in the male:female infant 
ratio based on the sex of their previous chil-
dren. Although women born in China who had 
a third child were 1.5 times more likely to have 
previously given birth to 2 girls rather than 2 
boys, this was not correlated with a higher rate 
of induced abortions or skewed sex ratios in the 
third birth.
Determination of fetal sex by ultrasonogra-
phy is 70% accurate by the 11th week of preg-
nancy and 99% accurate by the 13th week.37 In 
our study, births preceded by an abortion at 
15 weeks or more gestation were associated 
with a 3-fold increase in the odds of the birth of 
a boy to a woman born in India who had 2 pre-
vious girls, suggesting that many abortions per-
formed at 15 weeks or more, and some per-
formed between 12 and 14 weeks gestation, 
may have been done with knowledge of the sex 
of the fetus. For example, second-trimester 
abortions were used as a proxy for sex-selective 
abortions in a study involving married women 
who had an abortion in an obstetric hospital in 
Vietnam.39 In a qualitative study, abortion fol-
lowing ultrasonography was the most common 
pathway used to obtain a son among immi-
grants from India in the United States.40
Limitations
Our study has the following limitations. First, 
information on the sex of the aborted fetuses 
was not available in our abortion records. The 
timing of induced abortions was dichotomized 
in data collection by the physician billing codes 
and, therefore, we could not use different cut-offs.

Second, we may have missed some induced 
abortions. Data on in-hospital induced abor-
tions can be considered complete owing to 
mandatory reporting, and most performed in 
outpatient clinics are billed by physicians under 
OHIP. However, induced abortions performed 
outside Ontario or those paid for out of pocket 
were not captured. Such underascertainment 
may have diminished the size of our observed 
associations by inflating the baseline male:female 
infant ratio (1.68) among women  born in India 
with 2 previous daughters but no record of an 
induced abortion thereafter. Although the medi-
cal use of abortifacient agents, such as metho-
trexate, mifepristone and misoprostol, was not 
ascertained, this would not explain the skewed 
sex ratios we observed. These medications are 
used in about 2% of all abortions in Canada and 
are prescribed up to 9 weeks gestation,41 which 
is before fetal sex can be accurately deter-
mined. Other mechanisms may also explain the 
skewed male:female ratios (e.g., pre- and post-
implantation determination of fetal sex). 
Because the use of reproductive technology to 
select the sex of the fetus is prohibited in Can-
ada,42 some women may seek these services 
abroad. Limitations on sample size required us 
to collapse some countries into world regions; 
nonetheless, the country of birth of each immi-
grant was ascertained using notarized documen-
tation submitted during the immigration appli-
cation process.
Our findings may be generalized to other 
Canadian provinces because male-biased sex 
ratios are not substantially different between 
provinces.43 These findings may also apply to 
immigrants settling in other countries, as 
skewed sex ratios have been observed among 
immigrants from India in the US, United King-
dom and Norway.26–28,30 However, these findings 
should not be generalized to women of other 
ethnic origins who are not immigrants. Future 
studies may elucidate whether male-biased 
infant sex ratios are present among second-gen-
eration immigrants and whether they diminish 
with increasing exposure to Canadian society.
Conclusion
We found that high male:female ratios among 
infants of mothers born in India who immi-
grated to Ontario were associated with having 
had induced abortions, especially in the second 
trimester of pregnancy, when fetal sex can be 
accurately determined by ultrasonography. 
There is no simple answer to the issue of prena-
tal sex selection. Laws enacted to control the 
practice vary between42,44 and within coun-
tries.33 International agencies consider prenatal 
sex selection as one particular manifestation of 
sex discrimination against girls and women and 
call for the “urgent need of more-reliable data” 
for evidence-based policy development and 
action.45 Our study provides additional data that 
can inform the public debate on the issue. 
Further research may clarify the social and 
cultural forces that influence some immigrant 
couples to have more sons than daughters, par-
ticularly in the Canadian context, which is a 
more sex-egalitarian society, and where the 
given reasons for preferring sons are supposed to 
be undermined.10 The design of interventions 
should further consider the different voices 
within the affected ethnic groups, particularly 
those that promote women’s rights and empower 
women to achieve their potential.
