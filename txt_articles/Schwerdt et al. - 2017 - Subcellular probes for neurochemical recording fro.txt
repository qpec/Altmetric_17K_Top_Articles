Abstract
Dysregulation of neurochemicals, in particular, dopamine, is epitomized in numerous debilitating 
disorders that impair normal movement and mood aspects of our everyday behavior. 
Neurochemical transmission is a neuron-specific process, and further exhibits region-specific 
signaling in the brain. Tools are needed to monitor the heterogeneous spatiotemporal dynamics of 
dopamine neurotransmission without compromising the physiological processes of the neuronal 
environment. We developed neurochemical probes that are ten times smaller than any existing 
dopamine sensor, based on the size of the entire implanted shaft and its sensing tip. The 
microfabricated probe occupies a spatial footprint (9 μm) coordinate with the average size of 
individual neuronal cells (~10 μm). These cellular-scale probes were shown to reduce 
inflammatory response of the implanted brain tissue environment. The probes are further 
configured in the form of a microarray to permit electrochemical sampling of dopamine and other 
neurotransmitters at unprecedented spatial densities and distributions. Dopamine recording was 
performed concurrently from up to 16 sites in the striatum of rats, revealing a remarkable 
spatiotemporal contrast in dopamine transmission as well as site-specific pharmacological 
modulation. Collectively, the reported platform endeavors to enable high density mapping of the

Introduction
The brain is made up of billions of neurons that chemically communicate with each other 
through various neurotransmitters. Dopamine is a type of neurotransmitter involved in 
motivation, learning, and movement. Its dysregulation and deficiency is implicated in a 
number of pathological conditions, including, Parkinson’s disease, other movement-related 
diseases, and mood disorders 1,2. Dopamine signals display extensive variability across the 
striatum and other sites of the basal ganglia, having widespread connections to many other 
brain regions 3–7. When released through exocytosis, neurotransmitters flow directly across 
the synapse of two neurons and/or spillover to the extrasynaptic space to influence 
surrounding neuronal activity. The neurons carrying these chemicals are usually tens of 
microns in size, while the space in which neurotransmitters flow between the cells is at least 
a hundred times smaller—tens of nanometers 8. Thus, sensors introduced into the brain 
should occupy minimal volumes to precisely probe the highly localized changes in 
neurotransmitter concentrations without perturbing the delicate surrounding cellular 
environment 9. Furthermore, smaller sizes help reduce brain damage, which will help 
increase opportunities to safely employ these sensors in therapeutic applications, for 
example, in improving deep brain stimulation treatment in Parkinson’s disease patients. 
Integrating chemical sensors may help normalize the remedial effects of the stimulator if the 
stimulation schedules can be tuned adaptively to the level of dysregulated neurochemical 
activity, as monitored by the sensors, in these patients 10. In addition to miniaturization, the 
sensors should be widely distributed in order to examine dopamine’s neuron-specific and 
heterogeneous spatiotemporal dynamics. Despite the enormous spatial scales attained with 
electrophysiological monitoring of neuronal electrical activity 11–14, similar progress has not 
been seen with recording of chemical activity. Neurochemical transmission largely governs

 the electrical output of these neurons and for that reason should prescribe a major 
component of mapping brain activity and informing functional connectivity.
Of all in vivo methods used to probe dynamically these neurotransmitters, fast scan cyclic 
voltammetry (FSCV) provides the optimal performance in terms of aggregate temporal 
resolution (100 ms or less), sensitivity, and selectivity 9,15. The sensors for measuring 
dopamine are usually in the form of a carbon fiber (CF) microelectrode (CFM) comprising a 
7 μm diameter CF protruding out of a fused silica or glass shaft, in which it is threaded for 
insulation and structural support. CF has been shown to provide an optimal electrochemical 
sensing interface for measuring dopamine due to its biocompatibility, highly adsorptive 
surface, electrocatalytic properties, and small size 9,16. CFM sensors have realized prevalent 
implementation in analyzing the mechanisms of dopamine signaling and its function in our 
everyday behavior and in pathology 10,17–19. Considerable studies have further attempted to 
investigate the spatial diversity of dopamine neurotransmission in the striatum using the 
CFM sensor 3,4,17,20,21. These single channel investigations, however, are limited by the 
inability to reproduce precisely dopamine measurements at specific brain sites, as they 
require serial repositioning of the sensor and/or impractical numbers of specimens to assess 
dopamine heterogeneity. Very few have employed concurrent recording from more than a 
single channel: 2 channel monitoring from two individually-implanted CFM sensors to 
assess cross-hemispheric dopamine projections 22, or 4 channel monitoring with a 
microfabricated axial array 15 or threaded multi-barrel glass-pulled CFM electrodes 23.
Size reduction of the implanted probe, especially around the CF sensing interface, is critical 
to ensure measurement accuracy 24. The conventional CFM shaft, which makes up the bulk 
of the implanted device has a nominal diameter of around 100 μm (ESI†, Fig. S1), is large 
enough to compromise healthy vasculature, mechanically compress adjacent neurons, and 
activate a cohort of inflammatory processes in the surrounding brain environment 13,25–27. In 
addition to perturbing brain circuits along the implant path, this multifarious tissue response 
can deter measurement accuracy made at the CF neurochemical interface 24. For these larger 
(~100 μm) implant profiles, activated glia and neuronal cell death can extend up to 150 μm 
or further from the implant interface 26,28–30. Even probes of subcellular geometry (8–10 
μm), such as those presented here, are capable of producing astrocytic response, which has 
been shown to correlate to their proximity to surrounding vasculature 13. Thus, the (7 μm) 
CF neurochemical sensing interface, is also susceptible to tissue response, which may be 
heightened relative to the size of the adjoining shaft. As the estimated distance between 
striatal vasculature is around 60–70 μm 25, reducing the size of the implant can improve the 
probability of avoiding these susceptible microstructures. Smaller footprints could further 
enhance the reproducibility of ascertaining viable recording volumes in the brain during the 
implantation procedure.
Here, we report the development and use of subcellular (< 10 μm) sensors for measuring 
changes in dopamine from multiple sites in the brain (Fig. 1). Key advancements are 
reducing implant footprint (one order of magnitude smaller than state of art 15 and 
conventional CFM) (ESI†, Fig. S1) and stiffness, ability to record concurrently from 16

 channels, and high manufacturing reproducibility and yield. Our ability to construct these 
small and flexible sensors was leveraged by the inherent nature of the two materials that 
form their backbone: (1) the 7 μm CF electrochemical conduit and (2) the conformal 
parylene-C insulation. Cellular-scale devices have previously been constructed for electrical 
recording of cortical unit activity 13,14, but these present more straightforward construction
—the insulated CF is bluntly cut to expose a radial surface area (~ 40 μm2) whereby 
extracellular potentials are conducted. FSCV requires a larger surface area (> 500 μm2) for 
sampling nanomolar dopamine concentrations 31. Simple lift-off or etching processes were 
used to bare a discrete length of CF from its parylene encapsulation for a larger 
electrochemical sensing surface area. As the bared CF sensing elements are of the same 
geometries and materials to those used in conventional CFM sensors, the sensitivities 
attained are equivalent to the well-established sensors 3,4,10,17–21. Batch fabrication methods 
enable high-yield (8 probes per array and 10 arrays per batch) and reproducible construction 
of arrays with well-defined pitch (250 μm), lengths (up to 6 mm), and exposed CF sensor 
length (50–200 μm). However, the resulting, smaller, softer probes cannot penetrate the brain 
unaided. Therefore, the probes are temporarily stiffened by biocompatible polyethylene 
glycol (PEG), which dissolves readily during the insertion process and allows the small 
probes to be lowered to their deep brain targets 14 with limited brain damage. The resulting 
arrays permit multiple channels to be recorded concurrently, and therefore we pursued the 
design of 16 channel FSCV instrumentation to examine synchronous dopamine 
measurement from numerous distributed sensors in the brain. Probes were implanted in the 
striatum of anesthetized rats to demonstrate function in multichannel dopamine recording as 
well as make preliminary assessments of their induced inflammatory response.
Materials and methods
Device design and fabrication
Neurochemical probe arrays are fabricated as follows (Fig. 2). (1) A printed circuit board 
(PCB) with conductive traces interfacing a connector socket (Mill-Max, 
853-93-100-10-001000) is aligned to a micromold: a glass substrate with trenches (250 μm 
pitch) (P-M Optics, PGVG-2082205). The glass micromold is used to temporarily align and 
hold individual CF’s (7 μm diameter and ~10 mm long) (Goodfellow, C 005722). Silver 
epoxy (Epo-tek, H20S) is applied to the individual PCB traces to structurally and 
conductively connect each CF to the PCB. Ten such arrays can be aligned on a standard 100 
mm glass wafer (University Wafer, 1631). The epoxy is cured by placing the wafer on a hot 
plate for 2 hours at 120°C. (2) The PCB-CF assembly is extended 5–6 mm so that only the 
CF sensing tips (50–200 μm long) are anchored to the glass substrate, which are then 
masked by applying a small amount of photoresist (PR) (AZ Electronics, AZ P4330). PR is 
then cured by placing the wafer on a hot plate at 120°C for 15 min. The wafer is immersed 
in isopropanol for 15–30 min, followed by an adhesion promoter consisting of A174 
(Sigma-Aldrich, 440159), isopropanol, and distilled water at a volumetric ratio of 1:100:100 
for 15–30 min. The wafer is air dried for 30 min and then soaked again in isopropanol for 5 
min, followed by air drying for > 30 min. Parylene-C (0.5–1.5 μm) is uniformly deposited 
(Specialty Coating Systems, PDS 2010 Labcoater). (3) The release process to expose CF 
sensing tips is preceded by gently scoring the surface of the parylene atop photoresist layers

 to allow diffusion of subsequent acetone. CF sensing tips are exposed by exposing and 
dissolving PR masks in acetone (5–15 min dissolution time depending on amount applied), 
followed by rinsing in isopropanol. As the array assembly is pulled away from the 
micromolds after the PR dissolved, residual parylene (few microns in length) may be 
observed hanging to the CF tips. Because of the highly conformal nature of parylene, these 
hanging films of parylene are unavoidable during the lift-off process (ESI†, Fig. S1E and F). 
Another method explored to expose CF tips was flame-etching (Fig. 1C and D and ESI†, 
Fig. S1C), which obviates the need for PR and lift-off procedures. Instead, a butane torch is 
used to heat the probe ends protruding ~1 mm above water to remove the parylene. The CF’s 
are further trimmed with a razor-blade so that the exposed length is within 50–200 μm. In 
both cases, sensitivity of the probes was similar and functional yield of the sensors 
fabricated with either method was ~ 90%, but the flame-etching technique usually expended 
increased time. Obviously, these fabrication techniques will need to be optimized in future 
work to provide greater accuracy and reproducibility. Reactive ion etching (RIE) or oxygen 
plasma could be used to more uniformly pattern the CF sensing surfaces if etch rates can be 
properly controlled around CF tips. Difficulties in controlling temperature distribution at the 
suspended CF tips, which led to highly variable etch rates, impeded our abilities to employ 
plasma etching techniques in the current work. The fabricated CF arrays have individual 
electrode lengths of 5–6 mm with a pitch of 250 μm and diameters of 8–10 μm. Fig. 1A 
displays the completed array. Polyethylene glycol (PEG) (4000 to 8000 g/mol) (Sigma-
Aldrich) is used to temporarily stiffen probes and provide a dissolvable shuttle for brain 
insertion (ESI†, Fig. S2). The dissolvable shuttle is created by aligning arrays to micromolds 
(brushed with sterile mineral oil) and applying molten PEG (melted on a hot plate set at 50–
80°C). Once the PEG has hardened completely, the arrays can be detached from the 
micromolds. Because this coating is manually applied, the geometry varies, with an overall 
thickness of 0.1–1 mm, length of 4–5 mm, and width of 3–5 mm. Larger volumes will 
increase dissolution times in saline from few seconds to ~ 1 min per penetration depth (0.5–
1 mm) during implantation.
Experimental design
A total of 10 rats were used for implantation of the neurochemical probes. Among them, 9 
rats were also implanted with medial forebrain bundle (MFB) stimulation electrodes to 
controllably evoke and measure dopamine release, and the remaining rat was used for 
histological assessment of inflammatory response. In 7 of the 9 rats implanted with the MFB 
electrodes, evoked dopamine was discerned as conforming to aforementioned standards. To 
ensure reproducibility of the measurements, a minimum of 4 stimulation-evoked dopamine 
signals were collected for each stimulation paradigm and typically > 40 stimulation-evoked 
dopamine signals were acquired in each rat.
FSCV instrumentation
Two systems were used for FSCV recording of dopamine: a 4 channel system obtained from 
Dr. Scott B. Ng-Evans at the lab of Dr. Paul E.M. Phillips at University of Washington (UW) 
that has been used for numerous reported studies, and a custom built 16 channel system (see 
ESI†). The UW system was used in initial studies to confirm dopamine recording 
functionality of the implanted sensors with well-validated hardware and software. To

 practically make use of the channel capacity of the arrayed implants, hardware and software 
were built in-house for recording up to 16 channels concurrently. Recording performance is 
comparable for both systems: noise of ~0.1 nA (measured with a dummy load circuit 
mimicking tissue impedance consisting of a series capacitor of 3.3 nF and resistor of 10 kΩ, 
with digital filtering turned off and standard recording parameters), dynamic range of ±2000 
nA, and samples per scan of 175 (UW-4 channel) or 214 (custom built). The scan refers to 
the period in which a ramping voltage is applied to the working electrode (i.e., sensor) to 
detect electrochemical current. The scans are applied at a cycle frequency of 10 Hz for 100 
ms temporal resolution.
FSCV dopamine recording parameters
During recording measurements, the implanted CF probes were applied with a triangular 
waveform ramping from −0.3 to 1.4 to −0.3 V at 400 V/s for each scan at a cycle frequency 
of 10 Hz and a hold potential of −0.3 V between scans (in vitro, the ramp was from −0.4 to 
1.3 V with a hold potential of −0.4 V). Prior to recording, the implanted probes were 
conditioned by applying the same ramp at a cycle frequency of 60 Hz for a period of 5–15 
min. Ear-bars were connected to system ground to suppress coupling of external high 
frequency noise.
Chemometric analysis
Current recorded at each scan were concatenated to generate background-subtracted plots of 
the change in current along the applied voltages versus time. These plots represent current as 
a nonlinear color scale, the y-axis as the applied voltage, and the x-axis as time. At each time 
point (i.e., at each scan), the current change versus voltage plot (cyclic voltammogram, CV) 
is evaluated to distinguish the voltages at which current change occurs, which usually confer 
oxidation (positive change) or reduction (negative change) of an electroactive substance. For 
dopamine, the voltages at which peak current deflections occur, or the redox potentials, are 
−0.2 and 0.6 V. Dopamine concentration change is linearly proportional to the current at the 
oxidation potential (0.6 V). However, current deflections also occur at potentials outside of 
the targeted dopamine redox potentials, and these interfering signals may be attributed to 
other molecules or ionic changes at the CF sensor. To verify that the measured current 
corresponds to dopamine redox without significant interference, correlation to in vitro 
measurements of dopamine standards as well as principle component regression are 
required. Finally, based on these corroborated measurements, apparent change in dopamine 
concentration can be computed. In some measurements, a digital Gaussian filter was used 
with a standard deviation of 1 for scan variable and 0.1 for the voltage variable (i.e., sample 
point) and filtering is indicated in these plots. Otherwise, background-subtracted 
measurements were displayed without any digital filtering. All of these analyses were 
performed in Matlab (Mathworks, Matlab 2016a).
In vitro measurements
CF arrays were tested in vitro using a flow cell apparatus to extract dopamine sensitivity 
measurements and CV standards (ESI†, Fig. S2). Solutions used in the flow cell were 
phosphate buffered saline (PBS) or artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) buffer and dopamine

 hydrochloride (Sigma-Aldrich, H8502) as dissolved to a concentration of 0.25, 0.5, and 1 
μM in the buffer. A syringe pump (KD Scientific, KDS 200) was used to generate a fixed 
flow rate (~ 1–3 ml/min) to the outlet of a flexible tube (1/8 inch inner diameter) where the 
sensors were positioned. A sample injection valve (Valco, Model 22Z) was used to switch 
the sample flowing across the sensors between PBS and dopamine solutions with an 
electronic actuator. As the CF sensing interfaces comprise identical surfaces to traditional 
CFM sensors (same CF material), observed dopamine sensitivity (2–50 nA/μM) (ESI†, Fig. 
S2) is within range of prior work 3,4,9,15,17,18,32,19–21,31.
Identifying operational probes in vivo
Working channels were identified based on the recorded current before and after 
implantation. Only arrays having at least 6 working channels were used for implantation. 
Probes were defined as nonfunctional if they met any of the following 2 criteria: (1) a 
mechanical break of the probe along its shaft or sensing tip resulting in a measured 
maximum background current of less than 100 nA, or (2) a perforated insulation resulting in 
current noise (defined as the root mean squared of 10 scans along the oxidation potential) 
greater than 1 nA or resulting in current saturation (i.e., magnitude of background current at 
any potential ≥ 2000 nA). Characterization of all successfully implanted probes based on the 
aforementioned operating criteria are shown in ESI†, Fig. S4.
Surgical procedures
All animal procedures were approved by the Committee on Animal Care at the 
Massachusetts Institute of Technology and were conducted in accordance with the U.S. 
National Research Council Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. A total of 10 
Long-Evans male rats (Taconic, 350–450 g) were used for implantation of the 
neurochemical probes and were individually or pair caged with ad lib food and water. Rats 
were anesthetized with isofluorane (vaporizer set at 1.5–2.0%) supplied with oxygen at a 
flow rate of 1 l/min on a stereotaxic apparatus (Stoelting, 51600) fitted with a rebreathing 
circuit and mask (VetEquip, 921434). An analgesic, meloxicam (2 mg/kg) was administered 
subcutaneously. After incision and retraction of the tissue atop of the skull, holes were 
drilled (Stoelting, 51449) and craniotomies performed for the probes targeting striatum 
(anteroposterior [AP] +1.5 mm, mediolateral [ML] +2.1 mm), MFB stimulation electrodes 
(AP −4.1 mm, ML +1.7 mm), and reference electrode (AP −2.3 mm, ML −3.5 mm). In some 
procedures 8–10 bone screws (Stoelting, 51457) were installed on the circumference of the 
exposed skull to robustly secure implanted devices. After carefully removing the dura mater 
above the striatal target, the non-PEG-coated probe tips were lowered into the brain, as 
driven manually at a rate of ~0.1 mm/s with a micromanipulator. While retaining view of 
probes through a stereo microscope, if more than 2 probes deflected (this usually occurred if 
too long of the probe was unanchored from the rigid PEG shuttle or the dura was not 
completely removed), the array was immediately replaced with another prepared device or 
the dura was more carefully removed. After ~1–2 mm of the array was lowered, a small 
amount of PBS was introduced to the exposed brain surface to dissolve ~0.5–1 mm lengths 
of the basal portions of the PEG shuttle. The array was lowered again with effort to drive 
only the non-PEG-coated portions of probes into brain. These dissolve and lower steps were 
repeated until the array was lowered to a final depth of dorsoventral (DV) 4.5–5.5 mm

 relative to cortical surface. The array was then secured to the skull with acrylic cement 
(Ortho-Jet, 0206). In some procedures, a second array was implanted in the same manner 
immediately posterior to the first array. A Ag/AgCl electrode comprising a perfluoroalkoxy 
alkanes (PFA)-insulated and chloridized silver wire with an exposed tip of 0.5–1 mm (A-M 
Systems, 787000) was placed on the supradural surface of the contralateral hemisphere and 
secured to the bone with cement. MFB stimulation electrodes consisted of a pair of Pt/Ir 
electrodes, either parylene-C insulated 81 μm diameter (Microprobes, PI20030.1A3) or 
teflon insulated 125 μm diameter (Plastics One, MS333/18-A/SPC), with a tip-spacing of 
200–500 μm. These electrodes were lowered to an initial depth of 6.0 mm towards the MFB 
targets and then slowly driven further downwards at increments of 0.1–0.2 mm while 
stimulating at each depth to determine optimal depth (DV 6.0–8.7 mm) for evoked dopamine 
release, as recorded by the sensors in the striatum. Upon locating optimal depth, the 
electrodes were secured by filling the hole with silicone sealant followed by encapsulating 
the electrode and remaining exposed skull with cement. The implantation procedures are 
displayed in ESI†, Fig. S3.
MFB stimulation parameters
Current-controlled stimulation consisted of 24–48 biphasic pulses (2 ms per pulse) with 
amplitude of 100–300 μA and frequency of 60 Hz, as supplied by a stimulus isolator (WPI, 
A365) that was triggered by the software of the recording instrumentation. The MFB 
stimulation was usually delivered in intervals of 3–5 min to avoid depletion of the dopamine 
terminals. It is speculated that in the 2 rats that did not produce discernable dopamine 
response as recorded by the implanted arrays, stimulation electrode positioning along AP-
ML coordinates was not optimal. In 2 of the 7 rats producing successful recording of 
dopamine, the MFB stimulation electrode had to be removed and re-implanted twice to 
optimize its positioning for evoking measurable dopamine release. Imprecise positioning of 
the MFB electrode seemed to be the largest failure mechanism in the recording experiments.
Conferring dopamine chemical identity of in vivo measurements
Dopamine chemical identity of the measured electrochemical signals was conferred by 
analysis of the CVs of the background-subtracted data at maximum evoked oxidation current 
(i.e., current at the oxidation potential for dopamine, Eox = 0.6 ± 0.05 V, determined as the 
voltage at which peak current is measured), following MFB stimulation for each channel 
that showed change in current with a signal-to-noise ratio of > 5. These measured CVs were 
then analyzed against in vitro dopamine and pH standards (14 in vitro CVs) generated in the 
flow cell to compute Pearson’s correlation coefficient, R. Measurements were only 
identified as dopamine when R ≥ 0.8 as correlated to a dopamine standard. Furthermore, 
principle component regression (PCR) was used to assess the degree of residual or 
remaining current in the CVs that cannot be accounted as either dopamine or pH 33. This 
added regulation ensures that measured CVs highly correlated (R ≥ 0.8) to the dopamine 
standards maintain extraneous variance (Q, or residual sum of squares) below the calculated 
tolerance level (Qα = 585) for the principle components provided (i.e., 7 dopamine standards 
and 7 pH standards) that collectively estimate expected primary contributions to recorded 
electrochemical current with a confidence interval of 95%. An example of this analysis is 
shown in the ESI†, Fig. S5.

 Computation of dopamine concentration changes from in vivo measurements
Changes in apparent dopamine concentrations were calculated based on the current 
measured at the oxidation potential of dopamine (0.6 V). This dopamine oxidation current is 
linearly proportional to dopamine concentration, which can be shown in theory 21 as well as 
in vitro measurements (ESI†, Fig. S2). Dopamine concentration change is estimated by 
dividing the measured (and conferred) dopamine oxidation current by the measured in vitro 
dopamine sensitivity of the probes (nA/nM). To account for variation in sensitivity amongst 
probes, we show that the sensitivity is directly proportional to the nonfaradaic background 
current of the individual probe, as this background current is proportional to the surface area 
of the exposed CF sensor 34 and the resulting sensitivity 35,36. The background current is 
mostly equivalent to the displacement current generated through the double layer capacitor 
formed by the CF-brain electrolyte interface and the applied voltage ramp across this 
capacitor. By normalizing the in vitro sensitivity to background current, the calibration 
factor can be applied to all measurements regardless of the individual background current 
characteristics.
Histology
Electrolytic micro-lesions were made at the tip of some of the sensors to mark their locations 
in the striatum (cathodal DC current with amplitude of 20–30 μA applied for 20–30 s) 
(ESI†, Fig. S6). Brains were fixed for immunohistochemical analysis after probes had been 
implanted immediately after testing (in 2 rats with 8 channel arrays) or for 1–3 months (in 2 
rats with 8 channel arrays and 1 rat with 4 conventional CFM sensors) to assess 
inflammatory tissue response induced by probes. A ketamine/xylazine mixture (80 mg/kg 
ketamine and 10 mg/kg xylazine) was administered intraperitoneally (I.P.) to the rats. Upon 
confirming sufficient depth of anesthesia, the rats were perfused with 0.9% saline followed 
by 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1M PBS through the ascending aorta after incising the right 
atrium to create an outlet for the infused solutions. The brains were removed and were stored 
in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight, followed by 25% glycerol in 0.1% sodium azide (Sigma, 
438456) in 0.1M PBS at 4°C. Brains were blocked and frozen in dry ice. The block was cut 
at 30 μm intervals in the coronal (3 rats) or horizontal plane (2 rats) on a sliding microtome. 
Sections are stored in 0.1% sodium azide in 0.1M PBS. Some sections were used for 
immunofluorescence staining, and the other sections were used for Nissl staining. Sections 
were imaged with an automatized slide scanner (TissueGnostics, TissueFAXS Whole Slide 
Scanner) with 10× objectives.
Immunohistochemistry
For immunofluorescent staining, sections were rinsed 3 times for 2 min in 0.01M PBS 
containing 0.2% Triton X-100 (Tx) (Sigma-Aldrich, T8787) and then pre-treated with 3% 
H2O2 in PBS-Tx for 10 min. Sections were rinsed 3 times for 2 min in PBS-Tx, and 
incubated in tyramide signal amplification (TSA) blocking reagent (PerkinElmer, FP1012) 
for 1 hr. Then the sections were incubated with primary antibody solutions containing rabbit

Results and discussion
Recording MFB stimulation evoked dopamine in the striatum with pharmacological 
modulation
Two arrays (16 probes) were implanted in the striatum of 3 rats to assess heterogeneity of 
dopamine signaling. A simplified setup of the apparatus is shown in Fig. 3A and the 
projected configuration of the implanted probes is shown in Fig. 3B and C. The 
multichannel measurements reveal striking differences in dopamine release dynamics across 
the striatum, as can be visualized by the background-subtracted current measured from all 
16 channels from a representative MFB stimulation trial (Fig. 4A). In the representative 
experiment shown in Fig. 4, 2 channels were identified as non-operational based (see 
“Identifying operational probes in vivo” in Materials and methods) demonstrating noise > 
1 nA on channel 13 and background current < 100 nA on channel 15. The change in 
dopamine oxidation current (color intensity at ~ 0.6 V) and the timespan of these signals, in 
response to stimulation (at ~ 2 s) differ largely across channels. CV plots extrapolated from 
these measurements at ~ 1 s post-stimulation reveal 7 (out of 16) channels displaying 
discernable dopamine (Fig. 4B), which were further conferred for chemical selectivity by 
dopamine standards (ESI†, Fig. S5) for the selected stimulation trials. Measurements were 
further normalized to individual probe sensitivities to quantify, more precisely, actual 
dopamine concentration changes, which revealed contrasting differences in the temporal 
characteristics of the dopamine signal (Fig. 4C and D) and peak stimulation evoked 
dopamine (Fig. 4E) across sites. Spatially-dependent variability in the evoked amplitude of 
dopamine release are expected based on the differences in density of the dopamine releasing 
terminals in the striatum 15,21. The decay and rise time of the evoked dopamine signal also 
varied across measurement sites (Fig. 4F and G). The temporal characteristics of dopamine 
release and clearance are regulated by the overflow of these molecules following exocytosis 
from a nearby neuron and their uptake, primarily, via the dopamine transporter (DAT), 
respectively 37. Kinetic diversity of these dopamine signals has been speculatively attributed 
to the differences in number of uptake sites and/or affinity of the transporter at different 
locations 3,21,38.
Following intrastriatal measurements of stimulated dopamine, we investigated the effect of 
raclopride, a dopamine D2-receptor antagonist, on the spatially distributed changes in 
evoked striatal dopamine. Pharmacologic agents are often used as a means to corroborate 
selectivity of the electrochemical measurement 39,40. Raclopride, a D2-receptor antagonist, 
was administered to modulate the evoked dopamine response. Before administration, 
stimulation parameters were optimized to evoke consistent significant dopamine release in 
the channels demonstrating a dopamine response. Once the stimulation parameters were 
optimized (60 Hz, 48 pulses, 250 μA), 4 trials were performed with these stimulation

 parameters every 3–5 min. After collecting these pre-drug measurements, raclopride was 
administered (2.5 mg/kg I.P.), and 1 min later, measurements of stimulated dopamine release 
were resumed for at least 4 trials with the same MFB stimulation parameters. Raclopride 
administration amplified stimulated dopamine amplitudes on all channels that displayed 
evoked dopamine prior to treatment (7 channels) (Fig. 4E). Such amplification is thought to 
reflect inhibition of autoreceptors on dopamine axon terminals, which leads to increased 
dopamine efflux when these neurons are innervated. Furthermore, this inhibition may also 
diminish DAT uptake 15,40,41. Decay time increased at 5 of the 7 sites following raclopride 
(Fig. 4F), according well with evidence that raclopride has mixed effects on the decay time 
of evoked dopamine, either maintaining 41 or increasing its value 40.
Recording stimulation evoked dopamine in relation to MFB stimulation electrode depth
The concentration of evoked dopamine at any given striatal measurement site depends on the 
placement of the stimulation electrode in the MFB as the dopamine releasing terminals 
branch out topographically in the striatum 7,38. The multichannel probes were used to 
explore this spatial variability in 5 rats. In a representative set of trials, increased depth of the 
stimulation electrode was shown to reverse the distribution of peak evoked dopamine release 
along the mediolateral axis of the striatum (Fig. 5). Because of the heterogeneity of evoked 
signals observed across striatal sites and subjects, inter-subject correlation is not useful 
without a better understanding of the spatial distribution of these neurochemical dynamics. 
Nevertheless, this knowledge may be accessible in future studies through the use of a higher 
density of probes. These multichannel methods would also allow reproducible mapping of 
dopamine neuron projections to striatum by targeting stimulation to the cell bodies in the 
substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) and ventral tegmental area (VTA). In this study, only 
the axon bundle (i.e., MFB), which contains fibers from many brain regions including those 
outside of SNc and VTA, was targeted to induce dopamine release in the striatum, making it 
difficult to map specific connections.
Functional reproducibility of probes
The distribution of measured dopamine across all implanted and recorded operational probes 
(51 out of 58 successfully implanted probes were operational—see ESI†, Fig. S6C for 
distribution) was assessed across the 8 rats with successfully-implanted MFB stimulating 
electrodes to evaluate functional reproducibility of the microfabricated probes based on the 
tested MFB stimulation parameters for each rat and set of probes (Fig. 6). The ratio of sites 
demonstrating discernable dopamine release versus those that did not detect dopamine is in 
line with our observed yield (~50%) for the ability to discern evoked dopamine from 
individually acutely-implanted CFM sensors, as well as the evidence for distinctive striatal 
microenvironments that do not present measurable dopamine release 3,4,15,21,23. This 
observation is also not surprising as most single-channel experiments usually require precise 
optimization of the location of the sensor in the striatum to find a region with measurable 
dopamine release. Collectively, the arrayed platform reported here affords increased yield of 
measurable dopamine sites in addition to its greater throughput.

 Initial evaluation of brain tissue response to implanted probes
Histological examinations were performed to verify location of implanted sensors in the 
caudoputamen (ESI†, Fig. S6D) as well as to qualitatively evaluate the extent of their 
immunoreactive response (Fig. 7 and ESI†, Fig. S6). Except for sites marked with applied 
electrolytic lesions, no visible difference in expression for astrocytes (GFAP) or microglia 
(CD11) was observed along the estimated tracks of the sensing arrays (Fig. 7A and B and 
ESI†, Fig. S6B), relative to the unperturbed contralateral hemisphere (ESI†, Fig. S6A), as 
evaluated in 4 rats. The small sensor-incurred tissue damage contrasts with that of standard 
CFM sensors (Fig. 7C and D and ESI†, Fig. S6C). These findings are consistent with the 
inflammatory responses reported for similar cellular-scale probes used in 
electrophysiology 13,25.
Conclusion
Multichannel and minimally invasive probes were shown to measure dopamine concurrently 
from multiple spatially distributed sites in the striatum of rats and also induce minimal 
immunoreactive response in the brain. The reported arrays should open up new possibilities 
in probing the heterogeneous mechanisms of neurochemical transmission. The reported 
methods do not address the challenge of co-localizing functionally specific measurement 
sites across specimens, but they do offer the practical potential to classify dopamine 
transmission dynamics in terms of their spatial domains in the striatum in a high throughput 
manner. Synchronous measurements of dopamine from spatially distributed brain sites will 
be important to reveal the manner in which dopamine encodes, for example, motivational 
and/or cognitive states, in normal and disease conditions. Furthermore, the reduced 
inflammatory response associated with cellular-scale probes may help promote functional 
longevity of the dopamine measurements for chronic implant applications. These size-
reduction strategies also clearly reduce brain damage, which is essential for translating use 
towards clinical applications, such as for closed-loop treatment in Parkinson’s disease. 
Future work will involve improving batch fabrication techniques for greater uniformity 
across probes, increasing the channel capacity and density of the array, and implementation 
in freely moving animals. Although not explored here, the platform could readily be 
implemented for detection of other important neurotransmitters, such as serotonin, 
norepinephrine, and adenosine. Furthermore, these systems could be used with 
electrophysiological techniques, which would permit multimodal measurement of the fast 
changes in both electrical and chemical activity in the brain.
