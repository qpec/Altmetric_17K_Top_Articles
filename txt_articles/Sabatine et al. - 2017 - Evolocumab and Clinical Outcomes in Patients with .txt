BACKGROUND
Evolocumab is a monoclonal antibody that inhibits proprotein convertase subtilisin–kexin 
type 9 (PCSK9) and lowers low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels by approxi-
mately 60%. Whether it prevents cardiovascular events is uncertain.
METHODS
We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial involving 27,564 pa-
tients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and LDL cholesterol levels of 70 mg per 
deciliter (1.8 mmol per liter) or higher who were receiving statin therapy. Patients were 
randomly assigned to receive evolocumab (either 140 mg every 2 weeks or 420 mg monthly) 
or matching placebo as subcutaneous injections. The primary efficacy end point was the 
composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, hospitalization for un-
stable angina, or coronary revascularization. The key secondary efficacy end point was the 
composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke. The median duration 
of follow-up was 2.2 years.
RESULTS
At 48 weeks, the least-squares mean percentage reduction in LDL cholesterol levels with 
evolocumab, as compared with placebo, was 59%, from a median baseline value of 92 mg 
per deciliter (2.4 mmol per liter) to 30 mg per deciliter (0.78 mmol per liter) (P<0.001). 
Relative to placebo, evolocumab treatment significantly reduced the risk of the primary 
end point (1344 patients [9.8%] vs. 1563 patients [11.3%]; hazard ratio, 0.85; 95% confi-
dence interval [CI], 0.79 to 0.92; P<0.001) and the key secondary end point (816 [5.9%] vs. 
1013 [7.4%]; hazard ratio, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.73 to 0.88; P<0.001). The results were consistent 
across key subgroups, including the subgroup of patients in the lowest quartile for base-
line LDL cholesterol levels (median, 74 mg per deciliter [1.9 mmol per liter]). There was 
no significant difference between the study groups with regard to adverse events (includ-
ing new-onset diabetes and neurocognitive events), with the exception of injection-site 
reactions, which were more common with evolocumab (2.1% vs. 1.6%).
CONCLUSIONS
In our trial, inhibition of PCSK9 with evolocumab on a background of statin therapy 
lowered LDL cholesterol levels to a median of 30 mg per deciliter (0.78 mmol per liter) and 
reduced the risk of cardiovascular events. These findings show that patients with athero-
sclerotic cardiovascular disease benefit from lowering of LDL cholesterol levels below 
current targets. (Funded by Amgen; FOURIER ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01764633.)

The new engl and jour nal of medicine
L
ow-density lipoprotein (LDL) choles-
terol is a well-established and modifiable 
risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Mono-
clonal antibodies that inhibit proprotein con-
vertase subtilisin–kexin type 9 (PCSK9) have 
emerged as a new class of drugs that effectively 
lower LDL cholesterol levels.1 Evolocumab, a 
member of this class, is a fully human monoclo-
nal antibody that reduces LDL cholesterol levels 
by approximately 60%.2-6
Genetic studies have shown that carriage of 
PCSK9 loss-of-function alleles is associated with 
lower LDL cholesterol levels and a reduced risk of 
myocardial infarction.7,8 Moreover, exploratory 
data from longer-term follow-up in phase 2 and 
phase 3 trials of PCSK9 inhibitors showed signifi-
cant reductions in cardiovascular outcomes.9,10 
However, there were little more than 100 events 
in these studies combined. Further Cardiovascu-
lar Outcomes Research with PCSK9 Inhibition in 
Subjects with Elevated Risk (FOURIER) was a 
dedicated cardiovascular outcomes trial that test-
ed the clinical efficacy and safety of evolocumab 
when added to high-intensity or moderate-inten-
sity statin therapy in patients with clinically evi-
dent atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.
Methods
Trial Design and Oversight
The FOURIER trial was a randomized, double-
blind, placebo-controlled, multinational clinical 
trial in which patients at 1242 sites in 49 coun-
tries underwent randomization (see the Supple-
mentary Appendix, available with the full text of 
this article at NEJM.org). The executive commit-
tee and Amgen, the trial sponsor, collaborated 
in designing the trial.11 The protocol and amend-
ments were approved by the relevant ethics com-
mittees at all participating sites. The sponsor 
was responsible for data collection. The raw data-
base was provided to the Thrombolysis in Myo-
cardial Infarction (TIMI) Study Group, which 
conducted data analyses independently of the 
sponsor. The first draft of the manuscript was 
written by the first author. All the coauthors 
participated in subsequent revisions of the man-
uscript. The executive committee decided to sub-
mit the manuscript for publication and assumes 
responsibility for the accuracy and completeness 
of the data and analyses and the fidelity of the 
trial to the protocol, available at NEJM.org.
Trial Population
Patients were eligible for participation in the 
trial if they were between 40 and 85 years of age 
and had clinically evident atherosclerotic cardio-
vascular disease, defined as a history of myocar-
dial infarction, nonhemorrhagic stroke, or symp-
tomatic peripheral artery disease, as well as 
additional characteristics that placed them at 
higher cardiovascular risk. (Full eligibility crite-
ria are provided in the Supplementary Appen-
dix.) Patients had to have a fasting LDL choles-
terol level of 70 mg per deciliter (1.8 mmol per 
liter) or higher or a non–high-density lipoprotein 
(HDL) cholesterol level of 100 mg per deciliter 
(2.6 mmol per liter) or higher while they were 
taking an optimized regimen of lipid-lowering 
therapy, which was defined as preferably a high-
intensity statin but must have been at least ator-
vastatin at a dose of 20 mg daily or its equiva-
lent, with or without ezetimibe. Written informed 
consent was obtained from all the patients.
Randomization and Study Agents
Eligible patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 
ratio to receive subcutaneous injections of evo-
locumab (either 140 mg every 2 weeks or 420 mg 
every month, according to patient preference) or 
matching placebo. Randomization was performed 
in a double-blinded manner with the use of a cen-
tral computerized system, with stratification ac-
cording to the final screening LDL cholesterol level 
(<85 or ≥85 mg per deciliter [<2.2 or ≥2.2 mmol 
per liter]) and region.
End Points
The primary efficacy end point was major cardio-
vascular events, defined as the composite of car-
diovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, 
hospitalization for unstable angina, or coronary 
revascularization. The key secondary efficacy 
end point was the composite of cardiovascular 
death, myocardial infarction, or stroke. Other 
efficacy end points are listed in the Methods 
section in the Supplementary Appendix. Safety 
was assessed through collection of data on ad-
verse events and central laboratory testing (see 
the Supplementary Appendix). A central clinical-
events committee led by the TIMI Study Group, 
whose members were unaware of study-group 
assignments and lipid levels, adjudicated all 
potential efficacy end-point events and cases 
of new-onset diabetes. Definitions of the end

pendix.
Statistical Analysis
The primary efficacy analysis was based on the 
time from randomized study-group assignment to 
the first occurrence of any element of the pri-
mary composite end point. If the rate of the 
primary end point was significantly lower in the 
evolocumab group (P<0.05), then, in a hierarchi-
cal fashion, the key secondary end point and 
then cardiovascular death were to be tested at a 
significance level of 0.05. Additional details are 
provided in the Supplementary Appendix. All ef-
ficacy analyses were conducted on an intention-
to-treat basis. No imputation was performed for 
missing data on clinical outcomes. Safety evalu-
ations included all the patients who underwent 
randomization and received at least one dose of 
a study agent and for whom post-dose data were 
available. The size of the patient population in 
the trial was based on the key secondary end 
point, and we estimated that 1630 such end-point 
events were required to provide 90% power to 
detect a 15% relative risk reduction with evo-
locumab as compared with placebo.11 Hazard 
ratios and 95% confidence intervals were gener-
ated with the use of a Cox proportional-hazards 
model with stratification factors as covariates, 
and P values for time-to-event analyses were 
calculated with the use of log-rank tests.
Results
Patients
From February 2013 through June 2015, a total 
of 27,564 patients underwent randomization to 
either the evolocumab group (13,784 patients) or 
the placebo group (13,780 patients) (Fig. S1 in the 
Supplementary Appendix). The baseline charac-
teristics of the patients in the two groups were 
well matched and are shown in Table 1. The mean 
age of the patients was 63 years, and 24.6% of 
the patients were women; 81.1% of the patients 
had a history of myocardial infarction, 19.4% a 
history of previous nonhemorrhagic stroke, and 
13.2% symptomatic peripheral artery disease. At 
baseline, 69.3% of the patients were taking high-
intensity statin therapy (defined in accordance 
with American College of Cardiology and Amer-
ican Heart Association joint guidelines12; see the 
Methods section in the Supplementary Appen-
dix), and 30.4% were taking moderate-intensity 
statin therapy; 5.2% of the patients were also 
taking ezetimibe. During the trial, only 9.8% of 
patients had alterations in their background 
lipid-lowering therapy (see the Results section in 
the Supplementary Appendix for details). The 
rate of use of secondary preventive therapies was 
high, with 92.3% of patients taking antiplatelet 
therapy, 75.6% taking beta-blockers, and 78.2% 
taking an angiotensin-converting–enzyme (ACE) 
inhibitor or angiotensin-receptor blocker (ARB), 
an aldosterone antagonist, or both at trial entry.
A total of 27,525 patients (99.9%) received at 
least one dose of a study agent. Premature per-
manent discontinuation of the study regimen 
occurred in 12.5% of patients (5.7% per year), 
withdrawal of consent in 0.7% (0.3% per year), 
and loss to follow-up in less than 0.1% (0.03% 
per year), with similar rates in the two study 
groups (Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix). 
The median duration of follow-up was 26 months 
(interquartile range, 22 to 30), which resulted in 
59,865 patient-years of follow-up. Ascertainment 
of the primary end point was complete for 99.5% 
of potential patient-years of follow-up.
Lipid Data
The median LDL cholesterol level at baseline was 
92 mg per deciliter (interquartile range, 80 to 109) 
(2.4 mmol per liter [interquartile range, 2.1 to 
2.8]). At 48 weeks, the least-squares mean per-
centage reduction in LDL cholesterol levels with 
evolocumab, as compared with placebo, was 59% 
(95% confidence interval [CI], 58 to 60; P<0.001), 
for a mean absolute reduction of 56 mg per deci-
liter (95% CI, 55 to 57) (1.45 mmol per liter [95% 
CI, 1.43 to 1.47]), to a median of 30 mg per 
deciliter (interquartile range, 19 to 46) (0.78 mmol 
per liter [interquartile range, 0.49 to 1.2]). The 
reduction in LDL cholesterol levels was main-
tained over time (Fig. 1, and Fig. S2 in the Supple-
mentary Appendix). At 48 weeks in the evolocu-
mab group, the LDL cholesterol level was reduced 
to 70 mg per deciliter (1.8 mmol per liter) or 
lower in 87% of the patients, to 40 mg per deci-
liter (1.0 mmol per liter) or lower in 67% of the 
patients, and to 25 mg per deciliter (0.65 mmol 
per liter) or lower in 42% of the patients, as com-
pared with 18%, 0.5%, and less than 0.1%, re-
spectively, of the patients in the placebo group 
(P<0.001 for all comparisons of evolocumab vs. 
placebo). Evolocumab similarly lowered related

Evolocumab in Patients with Cardiovascular Disease
atherogenic lipid measures; as compared with 
placebo, at 48 weeks, evolocumab had reduced 
non-HDL cholesterol levels by 52% and apolipo-
protein B levels by 49% (P<0.001 for both). Ad-
ditional details are provided in the Results sec-
tion and Fig. S3 in the Supplementary Appendix.
Efficacy End Points
Evolocumab significantly reduced the risk of the 
primary composite end point of cardiovascular 
death, myocardial infarction, stroke, hospitaliza-
tion for unstable angina, or coronary revascular-
ization. The primary end point occurred in 1344 
patients (9.8%) in the evolocumab group and in 
1563 patients (11.3%) in the placebo group (haz-
ard ratio, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.79 to 0.92; P<0.001) 
(Table 2 and Fig. 2A). Likewise, evolocumab 
significantly reduced the risk of the key second-
ary composite end point of cardiovascular death, 
myocardial infarction, or stroke. The key second-
ary end point occurred in 816 patients (5.9%) in 
the evolocumab group and in 1013 patients 
(7.4%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.80; 
95% CI, 0.73 to 0.88; P<0.001) (Table 2 and Fig. 
2B). The magnitude of the risk reduction with 
regard to the primary end point tended to in-
crease over time, from 12% (95% CI, 3 to 20) in 
the first year to 19% (95% CI, 11 to 27) beyond 
the first year. Likewise, for the key secondary 
end point, the risk reduction increased from 
16% (95% CI, 4 to 26) in the first year to 25% 
(95% CI, 15 to 34) beyond the first year (Table 
S1 and Fig. S4 in the Supplementary Appendix).
In terms of individual outcomes, evolocumab 
had no observed effect on cardiovascular mortal-
ity, and hence P values for other outcomes should 
be considered exploratory. There were reductions 
of 21 to 27% in the risk of myocardial infarc-
tion, stroke, and coronary revascularization but 
no observed effect on the rates of hospitalization

for unstable angina, cardiovascular death or hos-
pitalization for worsening heart failure, or death 
from any cause (Table 2). The benefits of evo-
locumab with regard to the risk of the primary 
and key secondary composite end points were 
largely consistent across major subgroups, includ-
ing those based on age, sex, and type of athero-
sclerotic vascular disease (Fig. S5 in the Sup-
plementary Appendix). The benefits were also 
consistent across quartiles of baseline LDL cho-
lesterol levels, from patients in the top quar-
tile, who had a median LDL cholesterol level of 
126 mg per deciliter (interquartile range, 116 
to 143) (3.3 mmol per liter [interquartile range, 
3.0 to 3.7]) at baseline, down to those in the 
lowest quartile, who had a median LDL choles-
terol level of 74 mg per deciliter (interquartile 
range, 69 to 77) (1.9 mmol per liter [interquar-
tile range, 1.8 to 2.0]) at baseline. The benefit of 
evolocumab was also consistent across levels of 
intensity of statin therapy, regardless of ezetimibe 
use, and with both the dosing regimen of 140 mg 
every 2 weeks and that of 420 mg monthly.
Safety
No significant between-group differences were 
seen in the overall rates of adverse events, serious 
adverse events, or adverse events thought to be 
related to the study agent and leading to discon-
tinuation of the study regimen (Table 3). Like-

Evolocumab in Patients with Cardiovascular Disease
stroke did not differ significantly between the 
two groups. Injection-site reactions were rare, 
but they were more frequent with evolocumab 
(2.1% vs. 1.6%). The large majority of reactions 
(approximately 90% in each group) were classi-
fied as mild, and only 0.1% of the patients in 
each group stopped receiving the study agent 
because of an injection-site reaction. The rates of 
adjudicated cases of new-onset diabetes did not 
differ significantly between the two groups 
(hazard ratio, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.94 to 1.17). The 
rates of allergic reactions also did not differ 
significantly between the groups (3.1% vs. 2.9%). 
In the evolocumab group, new binding antibod-
ies developed in 43 patients (0.3%), and develop-
ment of neutralizing antibodies did not occur in 
any patient.
Discussion
When added to statin therapy, the PCSK9 inhibi-
tor evolocumab lowered LDL cholesterol levels by 
59% from baseline levels as compared with place-
bo, from a median of 92 mg per deciliter (2.4 mmol 
per liter) to 30 mg per deciliter (0.78 mmol per 
liter). This effect was sustained without evidence 
of attenuation. In this dedicated cardiovascular 
outcomes trial, we found that the addition of 
evolocumab to statin therapy significantly re-
duced the risk of cardiovascular events, with a 
15% reduction in the risk of the primary com-
posite end point of cardiovascular death, myo-
cardial infarction, stroke, hospitalization for un-
stable angina, or coronary revascularization and 
a 20% reduction in the risk of the more clini-
cally serious key secondary end point of cardio-
vascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke. 
During a median of 26 months of follow-up, the 
only adverse events that were noted to be nomi-
nally significantly more common in association 
with evolocumab were injection-site reactions, but 
these were rare, and the rate of discontinuation 
of the study regimen was no higher with evo-
locumab than with placebo.
The data from our trial provide insight into 
the benefit of decreasing LDL cholesterol levels 
to median levels lower than those in previous 
trials. Previously, significant reductions in major 
cardiovascular events were found in the Pravas-
tatin or Atorvastatin Evaluation and Infection 
Therapy–Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction 
22 (PROVE IT–TIMI 22) and Treating to New Tar-
gets (TNT) trials, in which the more intensive

cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke). I bars indicate 95% 
confidence intervals. The Kaplan–Meier rates for the primary end point in 
the evolocumab group versus the placebo group were as follows: at 1 year, 
5.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.9 to 5.7) versus 6.0% (95% CI, 5.6 to 
6.4); at 2 years, 9.1% (95% CI, 8.6 to 9.6) versus 10.7% (95% CI, 10.1 to 11.2); 
and at 3 years, 12.6% (95% CI, 11.7 to 13.5) versus 14.6% (95% CI, 13.8 to 
15.5). The Kaplan–Meier rates for the key secondary end point in the evo-
locumab group versus the placebo group were as follows: at 1 year, 3.1% 
(95% CI, 2.8 to 3.4) versus 3.7% (95% CI, 3.4 to 4.0); at 2 years, 5.5% (95% 
CI, 5.1 to 5.9) versus 6.8% (95% CI, 6.4 to 7.3); and at 3 years, 7.9% (95% CI, 
7.2 to 8.7) versus 9.9% (95% CI, 9.2 to 10.7). P values were calculated with the 
use of log-rank tests. The insets show the same data on an enlarged y axis.

The new engl and jour nal of medicine
statin regimen lowered LDL cholesterol levels 
from approximately 100 mg per deciliter (2.6 mmol 
per liter) to 70 mg per deciliter (1.8 mmol per 
liter).13,14 More recently, the addition of ezetimibe 
to statin therapy in the Improved Reduction of 
Outcomes: Vytorin Efficacy International Trial 
(IMPROVE-IT) lowered LDL cholesterol levels 
from 70 mg per deciliter (1.8 mmol per liter) to 
54 mg per deciliter (1.4 mmol per liter) and sig-
nificantly reduced major cardiovascular events.15 
In extending this concept further in FOURIER, 
we found consistent reductions in rates of car-
diovascular events across the range of baseline 
LDL cholesterol levels. Specifically, there was a 
17% reduction in the risk of the key secondary 
end point among patients in the top quartile for 
baseline LDL cholesterol level, in whom evo-
locumab lowered the median LDL cholesterol 
level from 126 mg per deciliter (3.3 mmol per 
liter) to 43 mg per deciliter (1.1 mmol per liter) 
(with the achieved level similar to that achieved 
with ezetimibe in patients in the lowest quar-
tile for admission LDL cholesterol levels in 
IMPROVE-IT16), and there was a 22% reduction 
in the risk of the key secondary end point among 
the patients in the lowest quartile for baseline 
LDL cholesterol level, in whom evolocumab low-
ered the median LDL cholesterol level from 73 mg 
per deciliter (1.9 mmol per liter) to 22 mg per 
deciliter (0.57 mmol per liter). These observa-
tions align well with the effects of evolocumab 
on coronary atherosclerotic plaque volume in the 
Global Assessment of Plaque Regression with a 
PCSK9 Antibody as Measured by Intravascular 
Ultrasound (GLAGOV) trial17 and show that con-
tinued cardiovascular benefit can be accrued 
even when LDL cholesterol levels are reduced 
to 20 to 25 mg per deciliter (0.52 to 0.65 mmol 
per liter), a range that is well below current 
targets.18-20
A delay between the onset of LDL cholesterol 
lowering and the emergence of the full clinical 
benefit of the intervention in terms of clinical 
risk reduction has been well documented in trials 
of statins, ezetimibe, and other LDL cholesterol–
lowering therapies.15,21-24 Likewise, in FOURIER, 
the magnitude of the risk reduction with regard 
to the key secondary end point appeared to grow 
over time, from 16% during the first year to 25% 
beyond 12 months, which suggests that the

Evolocumab in Patients with Cardiovascular Disease
translation of reductions in LDL cholesterol 
levels into cardiovascular clinical benefit requires 
time. Overall, 74 patients would need to be 
treated over a period of 2 years to prevent a 
cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or 
stroke.
In an observation consistent with previous 
trials of more intensive LDL cholesterol–lowering 
therapy as compared with moderate-intensity 
statin therapy,15,25 we found no effect of addi-
tional lowering of LDL cholesterol levels on 
cardiovascular mortality. The rate of use of evi-
dence-based cardiovascular pharmacotherapies 
that lower cardiovascular mortality was very high 
in FOURIER, in which the rates of cardiovascu-
lar mortality were one third of the rates in the 
Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study (4S).26 
Similar to the findings in the Study of the Effec-
tiveness of Additional Reductions in Cholesterol 
and Homocysteine (SEARCH) and IMPROVE-IT, 
in our trial we found no effect on hospitalization 
for unstable angina. The advent of increasingly 
sensitive cardiac troponin assays probably makes 
cardiac ischemia increasingly questionable as 
the true cause of a hospitalization for chest-
pain symptoms without biochemical evidence 
of myocyte injury.27 Finally, the rate of urgent 
coronary revascularization appeared to be more 
modifiable than that of elective revasculari-
zation.
Given these caveats, the magnitude of benefit 
of evolocumab in reducing the risk of major 
coronary events, stroke, and urgent coronary 
revascularization is largely consistent with the 
benefit seen with statins on a per–millimole-per-
liter basis of LDL cholesterol lowering (Fig. S6 in 
the Supplementary Appendix). These observa-
tions are in accord with meta-analyses of data 
from clinical trials of different lipid-lowering 
interventions, which show consistent clinical 
benefits per unit reduction in LDL cholesterol.28 
Likewise, these observations are supported by 
data from a recent mendelian randomization 
study in which variants in PCSK9 and variants in 
HMGCR were associated with nearly identical 
lower risks of cardiovascular events per unit re-
duction in LDL cholesterol.29
Achievement of these very low LDL choles-
terol levels with evolocumab did not lead to any 
significant differences between the two study 
groups in the overall rates of adverse events or 
in rates of study-regimen discontinuation. The 
rate of discontinuation of evolocumab injections 
because of adverse events that were ascribed to 
the drug was similar to the rate with placebo 
(0.76% vs. 0.67% per year) and compares favor-
ably to the rates that have been found with ator-
vastatin at a dose of 80 mg daily (1.5% per year) 
and with ezetimibe (1.1% per year) in other 
trials.14,15 The risk of new-onset diabetes in our 
trial appeared to be similar in the two groups, 
although the 95% confidence intervals did not 
exclude the point estimates observed with 
statins.30,31 Potential concerns about an increased 
risk of neurocognitive adverse events were not 
borne out in this trial. In contrast to recent data 
for bococizumab (a humanized but not fully hu-
man monoclonal antibody against PCSK9),32 
evolocumab-binding antibodies were rarely de-
tected in our trial, no neutralizing antibodies 
developed, and the overall LDL cholesterol–low-
ering effect continued without attenuation. Fur-
thermore, similarly reassuring findings with 
evolocumab were observed over a period of 
4 years in the Open Label Study of Long-Term 
Evaluation against LDL-C Trial (OSLER-1).33
The major limitation of this trial was a rela-
tively short duration of follow-up as compared 
with that in other lipid-lowering trials, in which 
follow-up periods have averaged approximately 
5 years.28 Although the median follow-up period 
in FOURIER was originally planned to be approxi-
mately 4 years, an event rate that was approxi-
mately 50% higher than had been postulated led 
to a shorter required duration of follow-up to 
accrue the prespecified number of events. Most 
but not all of the patients in the trial received 
high-intensity statin therapy, and ezetimibe use 
was infrequent. However, the benefit of evo-
locumab was consistent regardless of the inten-
sity of statin therapy or ezetimibe use.
In conclusion, inhibition of PCSK9 with evo-
locumab on a background of statin therapy 
lowered LDL cholesterol levels to a median of 
30 mg per deciliter (0.78 mmol per liter) and 
reduced the risk of cardiovascular events. These 
findings show that patients with atherosclerotic 
cardiovascular disease benefit from the lowering 
of LDL cholesterol levels below current targets.
