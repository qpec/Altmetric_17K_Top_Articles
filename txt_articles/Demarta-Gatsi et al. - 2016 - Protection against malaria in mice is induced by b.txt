Live attenuated parasites, in particular genetically attenuated 
parasites (GAPs), are increasingly being considered as vaccines 
against malaria. Preerythrocytic GAPs fail to develop in the 
liver, whereas blood stage GAPs cause abortive infections in 
the blood. In both cases, GAP infection induces solid pro-
tection against challenge.
The notion that attenuated blood stage parasites can 
confer protection originated in early studies using irradiated 
parasites (Waki et al., 1982; Miyagami et al., 1987). More re-
cently, it was found that infecting individuals with low doses 
of Plasmodium falciparum–infected RBCs (iRBCs) followed 
by rapid curative treatment induced strong cell-mediated im-
munity and durable protection against challenge (Pombo et 
al., 2002). Subsequently, blood stage GAPs were generated in 
rodent parasites, targeting genes involved in the purine sal-
vage pathway in Plasmodium yoelii (Ting et al., 2008; Aly 
et al., 2010) or genes encoding a protease involved in hemo-
globin degradation (Spaccapelo et al., 2010) and a merozoite 
surface protein involved in adhesion to RBCs (Spaccapelo 
et al., 2011) in Plasmodium berghei. These GAPs multiply 
suboptimally in the blood and cause infections that eventually 
self-resolve. Notably, abortive GAP-induced infections con-
fer lasting protection against challenge with blood stages or 
mosquito transmission stages and depend on both cellular and 
humoral immunity (Ting et al., 2008; Aly et al., 2010).
Recently, we described the crucial role of histamine- 
releasing factor (HRF), also known as translationally con-
trolled tumor protein, during development of P
. berghei 
ANKA (PbANKA) in the host liver (Mathieu et al., 2015). 
In vivo development of HRF-deficient PbANKA para-
sites is severely impaired in the liver, caused by elevated 
levels of IL-6 (Pied et al., 1991). To test whether HRF 
might also modulate blood stage multiplication, we deleted 
the HRF-encoding gene in P
. berghei NK65 (PbNK65). 
PbANKA induces cerebral malaria in susceptible mice, 
with lesions starting at day 5 postinfection (p.i.) and mice 
dying from day 7–8 p.i. (Beghdadi et al., 2008), which pre-
cludes studies on adaptive immunity. In contrast, PbNK65 
does not cause cerebral malaria but hyperparasitemia, lead-
ing to mouse death by severe anemia around day 25 p.i. It 
thus provides an opportunity to track immune responses 
against blood stage parasites over a longer period of time.

Deletion of the hrf gene in PbNK65 parasites causes 
abortive blood stage development
We generated hrf knockout PbNK65 parasites (PbNK65-
hrfΔ) by replacing the coding sequence of pbhrf (PBA 
Although most vaccines against blood stage malaria in development today use subunit preparations, live attenuated parasites 
confer significantly broader and more lasting protection. In recent years, Plasmodium genetically attenuated parasites (GAPs) 
have been generated in rodent models that cause self-resolving blood stage infections and induce strong protection. All such GAPs 
generated so far bear mutations in housekeeping genes important for parasite development in red blood cells. In this study, using 
a Plasmodium berghei model compatible with tracking anti–blood stage immune responses over time, we report a novel blood 
stage GAP that lacks a secreted factor related to histamine-releasing factor (HRF). Lack of HRF causes an IL-6 increase, which 
boosts T and B cell responses to resolve infection and leave a cross-stage, cross-species, and lasting immunity. Mutant-induced 
protection involves a combination of antiparasite IgG2c antibodies and FcγR+ CD11b+ cell phagocytes, especially neutrophils, 
which are sufficient to confer protection. This immune-boosting GAP highlights an important role of opsonized parasite-mediated 
phagocytosis, which may be central to protection induced by all self-resolving blood stage GAP infections.
Protection against malaria in mice is induced by blood stage–
arresting histamine-releasing factor (HRF)–deficient parasites

the human dihydrofolate reductase (hDHFR)–selectable 
marker in a GFP-expressing PbNK65 strain (Fig. S1 A). T
wo 
clones, PbNK65-hrfΔ1 and 2, were selected from indepen-
dent transfection experiments and verified to harbor the mu-
tant locus by PCR (Fig. S1, B–D) and Southern blot analysis 
(Fig. S1 E). Using specific rabbit antibodies against recombi-
nant PbHRF (Mathieu et al., 2015), the protein was found 
to be expressed at all Plasmodium stages tested and to local-
ize to the cytoplasm (Fig. 1, A–D), consistent with previous 
studies in human cells and PbANKA parasites (Bhisutthibhan 
et al., 1999; Mathieu et al., 2015). HRF was not detected in 
PbNK65-hrfΔ1 parasites (Fig. 1, A–D), confirming both an-
tibody specificity and successful gene knockout.
To assess the effect of pbhrf deletion on parasite 
blood stage development, C57BL/6 mice were infected 
i.p. with 105, 104, or 103 WT or PbNK65-hrfΔ1–infected 
iRBCs, and parasite growth was monitored by flow cy-
tometry. In mice infected with WT parasites, parasitemia 
increased steadily, resulting in severe malaria and death at 
approximately day 20 p.i. When using 105 or 104 infectious 
doses, PbNK65-hrfΔ1 parasites multiplied like WT until 
day 10 p.i., reaching parasitemia of ∼20%, and were cleared 
from mice at day 13 or 14 p.i., respectively. Mouse survival 
rate after injection of 104 or 105 PbNK65-hrfΔ1 parasites 
was ∼90% and ∼70%, respectively. Notably, injection of 
103 PbNK65-hrfΔ1 parasites did not lead to parasite clear-
ance or mouse survival. Infection with PbNK65-hrfΔ2, a 
second clone, gave similar results (Fig. S1, F and G). We 
concluded that infection with parasites lacking HRF can 
self-resolve and that parasite clearance depends on the 
initial parasite load and/or time to threshold parasitemia. 
Further experiments were performed after injection of 105 
PbNK65-hrfΔ1 parasites.

To determine whether clearance of mutant parasites 
from the circulation could be caused by parasite retention 
in the spleen, the parasite load in this organ was measured 
by RT–quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). After a dramatic re-
tention of PbNK65-hrfΔ1 parasites at day 6, parasites were 
no longer detected in the spleen at day 14 (Fig. 1 F), indi-
cating that parasite clearance was not caused by retention 
in the spleen (Fig. 1 G). Moreover, macroscopic exam-
ination showed a more important splenomegaly at day 6 
in PbNK65-hrfΔ1–infected mice than in WT-infected 
mice, suggesting leukocyte infiltration in the mutant-in-
fected spleen (Fig. 1, H–J).
IL-6, B cells, and T cells are critical for inhibition of 
PbNK65-hrfΔ blood stage growth
Because HRF-deficient PbANKA sporozoites induce IL-6 
production in the liver during preerythrocytic infection 
(Mathieu et al., 2015), we compared IL-6 levels in mouse 
spleens 6 d p.i with WT or PbNK65-hrfΔ1 iRBCs. Levels 
of IL-6 mRNA and plasmatic IL-6 protein were higher in 
PbNK65-hrfΔ1–infected mice than in WT
-infected mice 
(Fig. 2, A and B). Given that recombinant PbHRF pro-
tein is sufficient to down-regulate IL-6 expression in vivo 
(Mathieu et al., 2015), we tested whether clearance of mu-
tant parasites was the consequence of elevated IL-6 by 
infecting IL-6KO mice with mutant parasites. Mutant para-
sites developed normally in and eventually killed IL-6KO mice 
(Fig. 2 C), phenocopying WT parasite behavior in WT mice 
(Fig. 1 E). 
We concluded that increased IL-6 accounts for mu-
tant parasite clearance.
Immunostaining with leukocyte surface markers and 
anti–IL-6 antibodies of cells collected from the spleen at days 
6 and 20 p.i. identified IL-6–producing cells as Ly6G+ neu-
trophils at day 6 and both Ly6G+ neutrophils and CD11c+ 
DCs at day 20 (Fig. 2 D). Depletion of neutrophils (Fig. S2, 
A and B) or DCs (Fig. S2, C and D) in mutant-infected mice 
reduced splenomegaly (Fig. S2, E, F
, H, and I) and cell counts 
(Fig. S2, G and J) compared with nondepleted mice, confirm-
ing the contribution of neutrophils and DCs in the spleno-
megaly caused by mutant infection.
IL-6 is known to regulate the acute phase of the im-
mune response and major B and 
T cell functions (Kishimoto 
et al., 1992; Barton, 1997). To test whether B or T cells were 
involved in self-resolution of mutant infection, we infected 
mice lacking B cells (μSKO) or T cells (CD3KO) with WT 
or PbNK65-hrfΔ1 parasites and monitored parasite devel-
opment. B cell– or T cell–deficient mice were unable to 
control PbNK65-hrfΔ1 blood stage multiplication and 
died with kinetics similar to WT mice infected with WT 
parasites (Fig. 2, E and F). The importance of T cells was 
confirmed by the normal multiplication of the mutant par-
asite upon mouse treatment of previously protected mice 
with anti-CD3 antibody (Fig. 2 G and Fig. S2 K). This in-
dicated that B and T lymphocytes contributed to the clear-
ance of mutant parasites.
PbNK65-hrfΔ1 infection confers lasting protection in a 
species- and stage-transcendent manner
T
o determine whether resolved PbNK65-hrfΔ1 parasite in-
fection might confer protection against challenge, mutant- 
infected mice were challenged with 105 
WT PbNK65 iRBCs 
at days 20, 35, 68, 168, and 396 p.i. Mice were protected in all 
cases, displaying no detectable parasitemia at any time point, 
and survived for more than a year (Fig. 3 A). Mice challenged 
at days 20 and 23 p.i. with 105 RBCs infected with virulent P
. 
berghei ANKA (Fig. 3 B) or P
. yoelii YM (Fig. 3 C), respec-
tively, were also protected and did not develop parasitemia. 
Next, we asked whether mutant-infected mice were also pro-
tected against a challenge with WT PbNK65 sporozoites, the 
mosquito-transmitted parasite stage. Sporozoite challenge did 
not result in detectable blood stage infection (Fig. 3 D), and 
parasite genes were not detected in the blood by PCR (not de-
picted). 
T
o ascertain that protection indeed targeted preeryth-
rocytic stages and not just emerging blood stage development, 
the livers of mice challenged with sporozoites were analyzed 
by RT
-qPCR 40 h after sporozoite inoculation. As shown in 
Fig. 3 E, the parasite load was significantly lower in the liver 
of PbNK65-hrfΔ1–protected mice compared with control 
mice. A similar protection was observed against heterologous 
P
. berghei ANKA (Fig. 3 F) and P
. yoelii 
YM (Fig. 3 G) spo-
rozoite challenge. Therefore, infection with HRF-deficient 
blood stage PbNK65 parasites induces long-lasting protection 
against malaria in a species- and stage-transcendent manner.
Mutant-induced immunity involves Plasmodium-
specific IgG2c antibodies
T
o assess whether antibodies were involved in the anti–
PbNK65-hrfΔ1 response, anti–parasite-specific antibodies of 
various isotypes were quantified by ELI 
SA in sera of mice 
15 d p.i. with WT or PbNK65-hrfΔ1 parasites. As shown 
in Fig. 4 A, mice infected with PbNK65-hrfΔ1 produced 
higher levels of IgG antibodies than mice infected with WT 
parasites, essentially belonging to the IgG2c subclass and to a 
lesser extent to the IgG3 subclass (Fig. 4 A). Next, as shown 
by Western blot analysis of extracts from WT blood stages 
(Fig. 4 B), these antibodies recognized multiple P
. berghei an-
tigens in contrast to sera from 
WT PbNK65–infected mice or 
from naive mice (Fig. 4 B). Interestingly, the IgG2c isotype, 
expressed in C57BL/6 mice in which the IgG2a heavy chain 
is deleted, is known to be the predominant isotype generated 
in antiviral antibody responses (Coutelier et al., 1987) and the 
most efficient IgG subclass for antipathogen FcR-mediated 
effector functions (Nimmerjahn and Ravetch, 2005). In most 
experimental mouse malaria models, parasite-specific anti-
bodies have been shown to be predominantly skewed toward 
the IgG2c isotype (Ndungu et al., 2009).
Immunoprecipitation of P
. berghei blood stage proteins with 
the IgG antibodies from mutant-infected mice and mass spec-
trometry of the immunoprecipitate revealed five P
. berghei pro-
teins targeted by the protective IgG response (Fig. S3, A and B). 
These included the vaccine candidates merozoite surface protein 1

(MSP1), serine repeat antigen 1 (SERA1), and SERA2 (Bodescot 
et al., 2004; Putrianti et al., 2010; Alaro et al., 2013). As shown by 
immunoblots (Fig. S3 C) and ELI 
SA (Fig. S3 D), only sera from 
protected mice recognized the recombinant MSP1-33 antigen.
Next, to test whether IgG antibodies may mediate par-
asite clearance via FcRγ-expressing cells, WT or FcRγKO 
C57BL/6 mice were infected with PbNK65-hrfΔ1 parasites. 
As shown in Fig. 4 C, in contrast to WT mice, FcRγKO mice 
were unable to eliminate PbNK65-hrfΔ1 parasites and phe-
nocopied WT mice infected with WT parasites.
Antibodies and CD11b+ cells from mutant-infected mice 
mediate protective immunity
Finally, to assess what immune effectors are important 
for protection, we performed passive transfer experi-
ments. First, antibodies purified from protected mice 
were transferred to naive mice before challenge with 
WT PbNK65 parasites. As shown in Fig. 4 D, parasite-
mia was lower in mice treated with IgG from protected 
mice than in normal IgG-treated mice, suggesting that 
antibodies alone provide partial but significant protec-
tive activity (Fig. 4 D).
Last, we asked whether CD11b+ cells such as phagocytic 
leukocytes from PbNK65-hrfΔ1–protected mice might be suf-
ficient to protect naive mice from 
WT infection. 
WT C57BL/6 
mice with adoptively transferred CD11b+ cells from naive or 
PbNK65-hrfΔ1–infected mice at day 15 p.i. were challenged 
with 105 
WT parasites. 
As shown in Fig. 4 E, transfer of CD11b+ 
cells from mutant-infected, but not naive, mice efficiently pro-
tected against infection. Collectively, these data suggest that

parasite antigen-specific antibodies and FcγR+ CD11b+ cells 
play an important part in mutant-induced protection.
This study shows that abortive blood stage infection lead-
ing to lasting protection can be achieved not just by impairing 
parasite intracellular growth, but also by enhancing protective 
immune responses. Indeed, lack of HRF and an increase in 
IL-6 do not affect parasite growth per se because PbNK65-
hrfΔ blood stages multiply normally in mice until day 10. 
Rather, IL-6, which is involved in B and T cell differentia-
tion, boosts antiparasite adaptive responses that clear parasites. 
Like with previously reported blood stage GAPs that induce 
abortive infections, the protective response to PbNK65-hrfΔ 
parasites is both solid, conferring cross-stage and cross-species 
immunity, and durable. We found that the protective response 
relies on the combination of antiparasite IgG2c antibodies 
and FcγR+ CD11b+ phagocytic cells, in particular neutrophils, 
which are sufficient for solid protection. Interestingly, the dis-
covery of a B helper neutrophil population in the spleen that 
can act as professional helper cells for marginal zone B cells 
(Puga et al., 2012) highlights a neutrophil–B cell interplay 
that may be critical for B cell differentiation into antibody- 
producing plasma cells and may also contribute to inhibition 
of the well-known Plasmodium capacity to induce short-lived 
B cell memory (Wykes et al., 2005). Opsonic phagocytosis was 
also described as a protective mechanism induced by the plas-
mepsin-4–deficient mutant (Spaccapelo et al., 2010).

this represents the essential protective mechanism common to 
all self-resolving infections remains to be determined. Finally, 
although not formally demonstrated in our work, the contri-
bution of parasite-specific CD8+ cells to self-resolution cannot 
be precluded and awaits further investigation.

were harvested at day 6 p.i. with WT or PbNK65-hrfΔ1 par-
asites. 
The splenic index for each individual mouse was calcu-
lated as follows: spleen weight (mg)/body weight (mg) × 100.
Sporozoite development in HepG2 cells. 
 HepG2 cells (2–3 × 
104/well) were plated in 8-well chamber slides (Lab-T
ek) and 
cultured overnight in DMEM + GlutaMAX-I media (Gibco) 
supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS (Gibco) at 
37°C in the presence of 5% CO2. WT or mutant purified P
. 
berghei salivary gland sporozoites were used for HepG2 in-
fection at a ratio of 1:1 (parasite/cells) for 36 h at 37°C with 
5% CO2 in the presence of penicillin–streptomycin–neomy-
cin solution (Sigma-Aldrich). PbHRF was detected by im-
munofluorescence staining as described in the next paragraph.
Immunofluorescence assays for the intracellular detection of 
HRF. 
 Fixation and permeabilization of sporozoites, infected 
HepG2 cells, iRBCs, and purified gametocytes were per-
formed using 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.1% Triton X-100 
and blocked with 1–3% gelatin from porcine skin (Sigma- 
Aldrich). Thereafter, cells were incubated with specific rabbit 
anti-HRF antibodies (diluted 1:500; Mathieu et al., 2015) 
and then incubated with Alexa Fluor 568–conjugated sec-
ondary antibodies (diluted 1:500; Thermo Fisher Scientific) 
and 0.02 mg/ml DAPI for nuclear staining. The expression of 
PbHRF was detected using a fluorescence micro-
scope (AxioVert 200; ZEI 
SS).
Preparation of total RNA and RT-qPCR analysis of mRNA. 
 
The spleens and livers of C57BL/6J mice infected with WT 
or PbNK65-hrfΔ1 parasites were surgically removed 40 h p.i. 
or at day 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, and 20 p.i., respectively. T
otal 
RNAs were extracted from the spleen as well as from liver 
samples using the guanidinium-thiocyanate-phenol-chloro-
form method (all from Invitrogen). RNA was thereafter re-
verse transcribed by PCR (temperature profile: 65°C for 5 
min, 42°C for 50 min, and 70°C for 15 min) using 100 U of 
SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen), 40 U RNase 
inhibitor, and 2 µM oligo(dT) 18S rRNA primer (Eurofins 
MWG Operon) per sample. The expression levels of diverse 
transcripts were analyzed by real-time RT
-qPCR using Power 
SYBR green PCR master mix (Applied Biosystems) and var-
ious primer sets (Table S1). All reactions were performed in a 
real-time PCR machine (temperature profile: 50°C for 2 
min, 95°C for 10 min, 40 cycles of 15 s at 95°C, and 60°C for 
1 min; ABI PRI 
SM 7000 Sequence Detection System; Ap-
plied Biosystems). The relative abundance of parasite and cy-
tokine rRNA in the spleen was calculated using the ΔCt 
method and expressed as  
2 
−Δ 
C 
t 
 
. The mouse hypoxanthine 
phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) gene was used as an inter-
nal control for the variation in input RNA amounts. A no-
template control was included to ensure that there was no 
cross-contamination during sample preparation.
Flow cytometry analysis of spleen leukocytes. 
 Spleens were 
mechanically disrupted in 2 ml PBS, and cells were filtered 
through a 70-mm strainer (BD). Erythrocytes were lysed using 
Gey’s solution for 5 min on ice and washed twice in PBS. Sin-
gle-cell suspensions were stained for FACS analysis according 
to standard protocols in cold PBS containing 2% FCS and 
0.01% sodium azide (FACS buffer) with the following an-
tibodies: PE-labeled anti-CD4, PE-Cy5–labeled anti-CD45, 
allo phyco cyanine (APC)–labeled anti-CD8, FITC-labeled 
anti-CD11b, APC-labeled anti-CD11c, APC-labeled anti- 
Ly6G, PE-Cy5–labeled anti-F4/80, and PE-labeled anti–IL-6 
antibodies (all antibodies from BD). A total of 5 × 105 living 
cells were analyzed using a four-color flow cytometer (FAC 
SCalibur; BD) and ProCellQuest software (BD).
In vivo cell depletion. 
 For neutrophil depletion, C57BL/6 
mice were injected with 500 µg of a rat anti–mouse neutro-
phil (clone NIMP-R14) provided by G. Milon (Institut Pas-
teur) at day 2 and day 4 p.i. with PbNK65-hrfΔ1. For systemic 
DC depletion, CD11c-DTR-GFP transgenic mice were in-
jected i.p. with 5.2 ng/g body weight diphtheria toxin (Sigma- 
Aldrich) in PBS at days 2 and 4 p.i. with PbNK65-hrfΔ1. T
o 
determine whether CD3 plays a role in the antiparasitic 
memory response developed by protected mice, cell-specific 
depletion experiments were performed. C57BL/6J Rj–pro-
tected mice were injected i.p. with 20 µg anti-CD3 (clone 
145-2C11) Armenian hamster IgG (eBioscience) 24 h before 
the infection with PbNK65 WT and 48 h p.i. The cell deple-
tion was followed and confirmed by flow cytometry. Before 
the infection and every day p.i., 10 µl of blood was collected 
from the tip of the mouse tail and analyzed to confirm neu-
trophil, DC, and CD3 cell depletion by FACS analysis.
Detection of specific IgG antibodies and IL-6 cytokine in the 
serum of infected mice. 
 T
o detect parasite-specific antibodies, 
protein extracts from blood stages obtained by saponin lysis 
(0.1%) of parasite pellets were sonicated in lysis buffer (10 mM 
Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 0.02% NaN3, 20 mM MgCl2, 
1 
% Triton X-100, and complex protease inhibitors) and cen-
trifuged (10 
,000 g for 30 min at 4°C). The total amount of 
proteins in the supernatant was measured using a Bio-Rad 
Laboratories protein assay. 96-well plates (Nunc-immuno 
plate; Thermo Fisher Scientific) were coated with 2 µg/ml 
PbNK65 
WT protein extracts in carbonate buffer, pH 9.6, for 
2 h at 37°C and then saturated with 1% (wt/vol) BSA (Sigma- 
Aldrich). Serum samples were assayed using serial dilutions 
and incubated for 2 h at 37°C. Specific binding was detected

using HRP-conjugated goat anti–mouse secondary antibody 
(diluted 1:2,000; Cell Signaling T
echnology) followed by the 
addition of o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride substrate 
(Sigma-Aldrich). HCl 1N was used to block the reaction. 
The 
optical density was read at 490–630 nm. Each sample was 
tested against nonimmune serum and PBS as background 
controls. Amounts of IL-6 in the serum were analyzed fol-
lowing 
the 
instructions 
provided 
by 
the 
ELI 
SA 
kit 
supplier 
(BD).
Western blotting. 
 20 µg PbNK65 WT protein extract from 
asexual blood stages were separated by SDS-PAGE (4–12% 
Bis-Tris gels; BOLT mini gel system; Thermo Fisher Scien-
tific) and transferred onto a polyvinylidene fluoride mem-
brane (iBLOT system; Thermo Fisher Scientific). Sera from 
uninfected, 
WT, or PbNK65-hrfΔ1 mice were added (1:1,000 
dilution) and incubated overnight at 4°C. After washing the 
membrane with PBS + T
ween 20 (Sigma-Aldrich), poly-
clonal anti–mouse IgGs (1:20,000; P0260; Dako) were added, 
and specific bands were visualized with the SuperSignal West 
Pico kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manu-
facturer’s instructions.
Adoptive transfer of IgG-specific antibodies and CD11b- 
positive cells. 
 C57BL/6J mice were infected with either WT 
or PbNK65-hrfΔ1 parasites as described in the previous para-
graph. Specific IgGs and CD11b+ cells were obtained from 
challenged protected mice at day 15 p.i. Immune sera were 
collected, and the IgG fraction was purified on an immu-
noabsorbent protein G–Sepharose column (BioVision). 100 
µg IgGs was transferred i.p. into naive mice 24 h before WT 
PbNK65 iRBC infection. Mice were then given 100 µg of 
antibody on days 3 and 6 p.i. Single-cell suspension of 
CD11b+ cells was obtained from naive or PbNK65-hrfΔ1–
infected mice by FACs sorting of spleen and bone marrow 
cells stained with FITC-labeled anti-CD11b. Each mouse re-
ceived intravenous injections of 2.5 × 106 CD11b+ cells 1 h 
after WT PbNK65 iRBC infection.
Generation and cloning of PbNK65-hrfΔ parasites. 
 For con-
struction of the targeting vector for pbhrf disruption (PbHRF; 
plasmid provided by P
. Smooker and K. Taylor, RMIT Uni-
versity, Bundoora, Australia), DNA fragments corresponding 
to the 5′ untranslated (UTR) and 3′UTR regions of the 
pbhrf gene were amplified by PCR using P
. berghei NK65 
genomic DNA (gDNA) as a template. These primers (Table 
S2) were tailed with restriction sites for ApaI, PstI, KpnI, and 
EcoRI to facilitate cloning into either side of the hDHFR 
cassette (de Koning-Ward et al., 2000) in pUC18 backbone. 
The targeting construct was integrated into the pbhrf gene 
locus by double crossover recombination, resulting in the dis-
ruption of pbhrf and conferring 
WR99210 or pyrimethamine 
resistance. Transfection into a GFP-PbNK65 parasite strain 
and selection of recombinant parasite clones were performed 
as previously described (Janse et al., 2006). In brief, after over-
night culture (37°C with 10% O2 and 5% CO2 at 90 rpm) of 
the blood of infected animals, mature schizonts were purified 
using a Nycodenz gradient and collected at room tempera-
ture. The electroporation mix was composed of 107–108 
merozoites resuspended in 50 µl and 100 µl of human T cell 
Nucleofector solution (Amaxa) and 5 µl DNA (containing 5 
µg of digested DNA in water). Parasites were electroporated 
using the U33 program of the Nucleofector electroporator 
(Amaxa) and immediately resuspended in PBS and injected 
intravenously into 3-wk-old female SW mice. Recipient 
mice were treated with 0.07 mg/ml pyrimethamine in drink-
ing water or with 6 mg/kg 
WR99210 by subcutaneous injec-
tions, starting 24 h after electroporation. At day 6 after 
electroporation, the emerging parasite population was col-
lected, gDNA was extracted, and genomic integration of the 
hDHFR cassette (within the pbhrf locus of GFP-PbNK65 
transfectants) was confirmed using specific PCR primers: (a) 
Apa-5′UTR PbHRF-F and EcoRI-3′UTR PbHRF-R, (b) 
HRF5′-F and hDHFR5′-R, and (c) HRF3′-R and hDH-
FR3′-F
. 
The first pair of primers (Apa-5′UTR PbHRF-F and 
EcoRI-3′UTR PbHRF-R) amplified gDNA encompassed 
by the ApaI and EcoRI restriction sites and inclusive of the 
pbhrf 5′ and 3′UTRs. A PCR product of 2,681 bp was indic-
ative of hrfΔ, whereas a PCR product of 1,760 bp denoted a 
WT genotype. The second pair of primers (HRF5′-F and 
hDHFR5′-R) amplified DNA ouside the hDHFR insert 
(inclusive of the 5′UTR PbHRF) and within the 5′ region of 
the hDHFR cassette, respectively. A PCR product of 700 bp 
indicated a hrfΔ clone, whereas absence of a band denoted a 
WT genotype. The third pair of primers (hDHFR3′-F and 
HRF3′-R) amplified gDNA within the 3′ region of the 
hDHFR cassette and outside the hDHFR insert (inclusive of 
the 3′UTR pbhrf), respectively. A PCR product of 1,100 bp 
indicated a hrfΔ clone, whereas absence of a band 
indicated a WT genotype.
Statistical analysis. 
 All data were analyzed using Prism 5.0 
software (GraphPad Software). Unpaired data between two 
groups at a specific time point were analyzed by a Mann- 
Whitney test for nonparametric analysis when data did not fit 
a Gaussian distribution. A p-value <0.05 was considered to be 
statistically significant. All experiments were replicated several 
times as indicated in the figure legends.
Southern blotting. 
 gDNA was obtained as follows: parasite 
pellets obtained by saponin lysis of iRBCs were resuspended 
in PBS and treated with 150 μg/ml proteinase K and 2% SDS 
at 55°C for 20 min. The DNA was isolated from the parasite 
pellet using the DNeasy blood and tissue kit (QIA 
GEN). The 
DNA was digested with EcoR
V and probed with an hrf probe.
Mass spectrometry analysis, database search, protein identi-
fication, and statistical analysis. 
 After the immunoprecipita-
tion, proteins were solubilized in denaturation buffer (10 mM 
Tris, pH 8, and 8 M urea). Proteins were reduced, alkylated, 
and digested with trypsin. Tryptic peptides were analyzed by 
 1427
JEM Vol. 213, No. 8
nano LC-MS/MS (liquid chromatography coupled with tan-
dem mass spectrometry) using a chromatograph (EASY
-nLC 
1000; Thermo Fisher Scientific) coupled to a mass spectrom-
eter (Q Exactive Orbitrap). About 1 µg of each sample (dis-
solved in 0.1% formic acid [FA]) was loaded at 250 nl/min on 
a homemade C18 50-cm capillary column picotip silica 
emitter tip (75-μm diameter filled with 1.9 μm Reprosil-Pur 
Basic C18-HD resin [Dr. Maisch GmbH]) equilibrated in sol-
vent A (0.1% FA). The peptides were eluted using a two-
slopes gradient of solvent B (0.1% FA in acetonitrile) from 
2–30% in 90 min and from 30–80% in 60 min at a 250-nl/
min flow rate (total length of the chromatographic run was 
180 min). The mass spectrometer (Q Exactive Orbitrap; 
Thermo Fisher Scientific) was operated in data-dependent 
acquisition mode with XCalibur software (version 2.2; 
Thermo Fisher Scientific). Survey scan MSs were acquired in 
the Orbitrap on the 300–1,800-m/z range with the resolu-
tion set to a value of 70,000 at m/z = 400 in profile mode 
(automatic gain control target at 1E6). The 20 most intense 
ions per survey scan were selected for higher energy colli-
sional dissociation fragmentation (NCE 28), and the resulting 
fragments were analyzed in the mass spectrometer at 17,500 
resolution (m/z of 400). Isolation of parent ion was fixed at 
2.5 m/z, and the underfill ratio was fixed at 0.1%. Dynamic 
exclusion was used within 20 s. Each sample was 
prepared in triplicate.
Data were searched using MaxQuant (version 1.4.1.2; 
with the Andromeda search engine) against the Plasmo-
dium_berghei database (22,006 entries). 
The following search 
parameters were applied. Carbamidomethylation of cysteines 
was set as a fixed modification. Oxidation of methionine and 
protein N-terminal acetylation were set as variable modifi-
cations. The mass tolerances in MS and MS/MS were set to 
10 parts per million for each, respectively. T
wo peptides were 
required for protein identification and quantitation. Peptides 
and proteins identified with a false discovery rate <0.01% 
were considered as valid identification. Statistical analysis of 
the data was performed using Perseus, R package, MSstat, and 
internal tools. Two sample Student’s t tests were used to iden-
tify significantly regulated proteins between two groups. The 
results were visualized on volcano plots.
Immunoprecipitation. 
 Immunoprecipitation of Pb proteins 
from parasite extracts was performed using the Pierc Direct 
immunoprecipitation kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Before 
immunoprecipitation, 10 µg of purified IgG antibodies from 
the serum of protected, infected, and naive mice was directly 
immobilized onto an agarose support (AminoLink Plus 
Resin) using a short coupling protocol. 500–700 µg of para-
site extracts was incubated with the immobilized antibody to 
form the immune complex with gentle end-over-end mixing 
overnight at 4°C. T
o remove nonbound material, beads were 
washed three times with wash buffer, and a low pH elution 
buffer was used to dissociate the bound antigen from the an-
tibody. Immunoprecipitated proteins were then used for 
mass spectrometry analysis.
