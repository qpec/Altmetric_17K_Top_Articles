IMPORTANCE In the age of information and patient-centered care, new methods of delivering
postoperative care must be developed and evaluated.
OBJECTIVE To determine whether follow-up care delivered via a mobile app can be used to
avert in-person follow-up care visits compared with conventional, in-person follow-up care in
the first 30 days following ambulatory surgery.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A randomized clinical trial was conducted from
February 1 to August 31, 2015, among ambulatory patients undergoing breast reconstruction
at an academic ambulatory care hospital. Patients were randomly assigned to receive
follow-up care via a mobile app or at an in-person visit during the first 30 days after the
operation. Analysis was intention-to-treat.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary end point was the number of in-person
follow-up visits during the first 30 days after the operation. Secondary end points were the
number of telephone calls and emails to health care professionals, patient-reported
convenience and satisfaction scores, and rates of complications.
RESULTS Of the 65 women in the study (mean [SD] age, 47.7 [13.4] years), 32 (49%) were in
the mobile app group, and 33 (51%) were in the in-person follow-up care group. Those in the
mobile app group attended a mean of 0.66 in-person visits, vs 1.64 in-person visits in the
in-person follow-up care group, for a difference of 0.40 times fewer in-person visits (95% CI,
0.24-0.66; P < .001) and sent more emails to their health care professionals during the first
30 days after the operation (mean, 0.65 vs 0.15; incidence rate ratio, 4.13; 95% CI, 1.55-10.99;
P = .005) than did patients in the in-person follow-up care group. This statistically significant
difference was maintained at 3 months postoperatively. The mobile app group reported
higher convenience scores than the in-person follow-up care group (incidence rate ratio, 1.39;
95% CI, 1.09-1.77; P = .008). There was no difference between groups in the number of
telephone communications, satisfaction scores, or complication rates.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Patients undergoing ambulatory breast reconstruction can
use follow-up care via a mobile app to avert in-person follow-up visits during the first 30 days
after the operation. Mobile app follow-up care affects neither complication rates nor
patient-reported satisfaction scores, but it improves patient-reported convenience scores.

n the age of patient-centric care, delivery models must
evolve to become more convenient for patients and cost-
effectivetothehealthsystem,whilealsomaintainingahigh
degree of patient satisfaction and convenience. Many centers
are now substituting in-person follow-up care with care de-

remote modes of follow-up are safe and that patients are
as equally satisfied with them as they are with in-person fol-

Women’
s College Hospital in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, of-
fers specialized surgical procedures, including breast recon-
structiontypicallyfollowingmastectomyforbreastcancer.The
goal of surgery is to restore a breast mound and improve the
quality of life of cancer survivors.7-9 These procedures are per-
formed on an ambulatory basis; all patients go home on the
day of or the day after surgery. Patients often travel signifi-
cant distances to receive this care. Traveling for surgery is not
unique to patients who undergo breast reconstruction; surgi-
cal care programs have become regionalized to ensure higher
volumes in specific centers of excellence, which means that
more patients travel to receive that care.10,11
In general, the morbidity and mortality rates following
ambulatory surgery are very low.12 Complication rates in this
subset of patients undergoing breast reconstruction are ap-
proximately 5% to 7.5%,13,14 making most follow-up visits
perfunctory.
The QoC Health Inc mobile app allows patients to submit
photographs and answers to a validated quality of recovery
questionnaire and a pain visual analog scale using a mobile de-
vice for the first 30 days after the operation. Surgeons are able
to follow patient reports on a web portal. This technology has
been used for patients who have undergone ambulatory breast
reconstruction.15 Our study builds on preexisting data15,16 by
determining whether receiving follow-up via the mobile app
can avert the need for in-person follow-up care.
Methods
This pragmatic, single-center, open, controlled, 2-arm parallel-
groupsuperiorityrandomizedclinicaltrialwasconductedfrom
February 1 to August 31, 2015, to compare follow-up care de-
livered via mobile app vs in person during the first 30 days fol-
lowing ambulatory breast reconstruction. Permutated-block
randomizationwasconductedbyblocksof4to6usingthepro-
gram RALLOC in Stata statistical software (StataCorp).17 The
complete research protocol is available in the Supplement.18
This study complies with the standards outlined in the Tri-
Council Policy Statement and was approved by the Women’
s
College Hospital Research Ethics Board. During a 5-month pe-
riod, eligible patients were consecutively approached by a se-
nior author not directly involved in patient care (K.A.A.) dur-
ingtheirpreoperativevisits,andwritteninformedconsentwas
obtained.
All ambulatory patients undergoing elective breast recon-
struction at Women’
s College Hospital were included in this
study. Patients had to be able to use a mobile device and com-
municateinEnglish.Allpatientswerenonsmokerswithabody
mass index of 30 or less (calculated as weight in kilograms di-
vided by height in meters squared) because these are require-
ments for ambulatory breast reconstruction. Patients were ex-
cluded if they experienced chronic pain, were taking narcotic
(morphine-like) medication for pain on a regular basis, or had
an allergy to local anesthetics or morphine-like medications.
Pain ratings captured in the pain visual analog scale and qual-
ity of recovery 9-item questionnaire are important for judg-
ing the quality of postoperative recovery. Preexisting pain or
an inability to take narcotics would compromise the reliabil-
ity of these measures.
Procedures were performed by 3 surgeons (M.B., B.B., and
J.L.S.), with more than 90% of cases being performed by 2 sur-
geons within this group of surgeons. Randomization was per-
formed by an outside statistician and occurred in equal pro-
portions (1:1) between those using the mobile app and those
receiving in-person follow-up care. After a patient agreed to
participate in the study, she was provided a sequentially num-
bered envelope containing her group assignment by the en-
rolling senior author. All patients received what is currently
the standard of care in this hospital. Patients in the conven-
tional follow-up group had planned clinic follow-up at ap-
proximately 1 week and 4 weeks after the operation. This is the
follow-up schedule currently used by all surgeons.
The mobile app follow-up group had no planned in-
person follow-up at 1 week and 4 weeks after the operation.
However, these visits were replaced with an examination of
the surgical site via photographs submitted through the mo-
bile app, as well as monitoring of the results of the pain visual
analog scale, and quality of recovery 9-item questionnaire. Pa-
tient reporting began after discharge from the recovery room.
Since 75% of complications occur within the first 2 weeks of
discharge,12 we used daily monitoring for 2 weeks and then
weekly monitoring for the remaining 2 weeks (totaling 30 days
of monitoring). Patients were reminded by email to complete
regular reporting if a submission was not received. The data
entered through the mobile app reached a double-encrypted
server. The surgeon used a wireless interface to access those
data and monitor the patient’
s condition (not in real time).
High pain scores were flagged in the database for quick view-
ing. Any red flags (abnormally high pain scores or abnormally
low quality of recovery 9-item questionnaire scores) prompted
in-person follow-up. Physicians summarized the clinical
Key Points
Question For patients undergoing ambulatory surgery, can
follow-up care via a mobile app avert in-person visits compared
with conventional, in-person follow-up care during the first 30
days after the operation?
Findings In this randomized clinical trial of 65 patients, those who
used the mobile app attended fewer in-person visits for follow-up
care during the first 30 days after the operation than patients in
the in-person follow-up care group. This difference was statistically
significant.
Meaning Follow-up care delivered via a mobile app can be used to
avert in-person visits following ambulatory surgery.

Outcome Measures
Themainoutcomewasthetotalnumberoffollow-upvisits(in-
cluding specialists, family physician, and emergency depart-
ment) associated with the surgery. These data were captured
at 30 days after the surgery by patient survey and recon-
firmed via review of the medical record.
Thesecondaryoutcomesincludedthetotalnumberoftele-
phone calls and emails to the health care team associated with
the surgery, satisfaction and convenience scores, and postop-
erative complications. All secondary outcome data were cap-
tured by telephone survey 30 days after the surgery. Patient-
reported satisfaction and convenience scores were recorded
using a 5-point Likert scale. Complications were defined as ad-
verse events that were attributed to the surgery and required
a medical or surgical intervention.
Statistical Analysis
Descriptive statistics (frequencies and mean [SD] values) were
calculated for all clinical and outcome variables. All data ob-
tained in this study were entered into Excel and analyzed using
Stata version 13 (StataCorp LP).
We used person-level Poisson regression to determine if
there was a statistically significant difference between pa-
tients using the mobile app and those receiving in-person fol-
low-up care in count data including the number of in-person
follow-up visits attended, the number of telephone calls and
emails to health care professionals, and the 5-point patient-
reported satisfaction and convenience scores. The goodness
of fit of all Poisson regression models was confirmed with the
χ2 test. Complications were recorded as a binary variable. A
2-sampletestofproportionswasusedtodetermineiftherewas
a statistically significant difference in complication rates be-
tween patients using the mobile app and those receiving in-
person follow-up care. A covariate adjustment was per-
formed if any of the relevant variables remained unbalanced
after randomization.
The average patient who underwent breast reconstruc-
tion attends 2 in-person follow-up visits within the first month
after surgery. We assumed that we could avert at least 1 in-
person visit in the group using the mobile app and that we
would have an equal number of participants in both groups.
Therefore, the E test between 2 Poisson mean values for count
data was used to generate a sample size of 64 (32 patients per
group) at a power of 95% (α = .05).20 Assuming a 10% drop-
out rate, we increased the sample size target to 36 patients per
group.
The study was also powered to detect a 5–percentage-
pointdifferenceinthecomplicationratesbetweengroupsusing
the Fisher exact test comparing 2 independent proportions
(α = .05). This magnitude of increase was thought to be a clini-
callyrelevantdifferencegiventheknownvariabilityintherates

Results
Demographic and Surgical Data
A total of 77 eligible patients were approached consecutively
during the 5-month study period. Figure 1 demonstrates the
flow scheme of all study patients. A total of 65 patients were
enrolled in the study: 33 completed in-person follow-up care
and 32 completed mobile app follow-up care. No patients were
lost to follow-up. There were no missing data. The trial was
completed 30 days after the final patient had surgery. See the
Table for patient demographics. Major surgery was defined as
a bilateral mastectomy and immediate reconstruction or a de-
layed pedicled autologous breast reconstruction based largely
on the length and complexity of the procedures. Using a le-
nient P value of .10, we found that prior radiotherapy (8 [24%]
vs 15 [47%]) and mean distance from the hospital to the pa-
tient’
s home (120 vs 53 km) were unbalanced between the in-
person and mobile app groups. All other variables were well
balanced (Table).

difference was maintained at 3 months postoperatively (inci-

sonable to anticipate that patients who underwent prior ra-
diotherapymayrequiremorefollow-upbecauseofahigherpo-
tential of delayed wound healing and other complications. It
is also reasonable to anticipate that patients who live further
from the hospital may attend fewer in-person follow-up vis-
its. After adjustment for these covariates, the significant dif-
ference in the number of in-person follow-ups during the first
30 days after surgery was robust between the in-person group
and the mobile app group (prior radiotherapy: IRR, 0.42; 95%
CI, 0.25-0.70; P = .001; and distance from home to the hospi-
tal: IRR, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.23-0.64; P < .001).
Total Number of Emails and Telephone Calls
During the First 30 Days
The group receiving in-person follow-up care made a mean
0.30 telephone calls to their health care professionals during
thefirst30daysaftersurgery(median,0telephonecalls;range,
0-2 telephone calls). The group using the mobile app made a
mean of 0.31 telephone calls during the first 30 days after sur-
gery (median, 0 telephone calls; range, 0-2 telephone calls).
Therewasnostatisticallysignificantdifferencebetweengroups
(IRR, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.43-2.48; P = .95). However, the group
using the mobile app did send more emails than did the in-
person group during the first 30 days after surgery (IRR, 4.13;
95% CI, 1.55-10.99; P = .005). The group using the mobile app
sent a mean of 0.65 emails (median, 0.5 emails; range, 0-3
emails)andthein-persongroupsentameanof0.15emails(me-
dian, 0 emails; range, 0-1 emails). These findings were robust
after adjustment for the unbalanced covariates of prior radio-
therapy and distance from the patient’
s home to the hospital
(IRR, 4.38; 95% CI, 1.62-11.84; P = .004 and IRR, 4.84; 95% CI,
1.69-13.84; P = .003, respectively).
Patient-Reported Satisfaction and Convenience Scores
Satisfaction and convenience scores were garnered using a
5-point Likert scale (Figure 2 and Figure 3). There was no
statistically significant difference in satisfaction scores
between groups (IRR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.76-1.20; P = .70).
However, the group using the mobile app reported higher
convenience scores than did the group receiving in-person
follow-up care (IRR, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.09-1.77; P = .008).
Thirty-one patients in the mobile app group (97%) agreed or
strongly agreed that the type of follow-up care they received
was convenient. Only 16 patients in the in-person group
(48%) agreed or strongly agreed that the type of follow-up
care they received was convenient.
Again,becausethecovariatesofpriorradiotherapyandthe
distance from the patient’
s home to the hospital remained un-
balanced between groups after randomization, we adjusted for
these covariates and found that the significant difference in
the convenience scores between the mobile app group and the
in-persongroupwasrobust(IRR,1.39;95%CI,1.08-1.79;P = .01
and IRR, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.05-1.73; P = .02, respectively).

plications (P = .42). The overall rate of reoperation was 3% (2

tients who underwent a major surgery.
Discussion
Follow-up via a mobile app can be used to eliminate in-
person follow-up visits during the first 30 days following am-
bulatory breast reconstruction surgery. Patients using the
mobile app attended 0.40 times fewer in-person visits for fol-
low-up care and sent more emails to their health care profes-
sionals during the first 30 days after surgery than did patients
in the in-person follow-up group. This finding is important be-
cause a common criticism of telemedicine or virtual commu-
nication between patients and health care professionals is
whether it truly replaces in-person care.24 There was no sta-
tistically significant difference between groups in satisfac-
tion scores; however, patients using the mobile app were more
likely to agree or strongly agree that the type of follow-up care
they received was convenient. Improving patient conve-
nience without compromising satisfaction is another critical
finding as we look for ways to build a patient-centric health
care system that supports quicker recovery and resumption
of normal daily living. There was no statistically significant
difference between groups in the rate of postoperative
complications.
Previousprospectiveandretrospectivecohortstudieshave
been performed in a variety of ambulatory patient popula-
tions and have shown similar results.3,6,25,26 Hwa and Wren3
found that surveys conducted by physician assistants could
be safely used as a substitute for in-person follow-up among
patients who underwent open herniorrhaphy and laparo-
scopic cholecystectomy, with a high degree of patient satis-
faction.Jonesetal26foundthattelephoneinterviewsandstan-
dardized postoperative questionnaires pose no additional risk
topediatricpatientsundergoingtonsillectomyand/oradenoid-
ectomy compared with their previous experience with sched-
uled postsurgical clinic follow-ups. Our study is unique in that
it is the first randomized clinical trial, to our knowledge, to
examine the effect of replacing in-person follow-up care with
follow-up care delivered via a mobile app. It is also the first
time, to our knowledge, that a mobile app has been used as
the platform for collecting patient-reported outcomes or sur-
vey data. All previous studies have relied on telephone
interviews.3,6,25,26
A growing number of procedures, including complex op-
erations such as autologous breast reconstruction, are of-
fered in an ambulatory setting. Patients using the mobile app
require approximately 2 minutes to input the quality of recov-
ery, pain visual analog scale, and photographs of the surgical
site. This ease of use allows patients to submit data fre-
quently (ie, daily or weekly), providing a continuous, richer in-
flow of information than could ever be achieved by tele-
phone or in-person follow-up care. As we look for ways to
improve clinical care, the granular data collected via the mo-
bile app could be used to augment the National Surgical Qual-
ity Improvement Programs occurring across the country.27,28
Limitations
The limitations of this trial include the single ambulatory pa-
tientpopulation.Thesefindingsarelikelygeneralizabletoother
ambulatory patient populations, given the similar findings al-
ready discussed, but are not generalizable to individuals re-
ceiving inpatient breast reconstruction. In addition, we were
unable to conduct the study in a blinded fashion owing to the
nature of the intervention. We did not power our study to de-
tect a significant difference in the number of emergency de-
partment visits between groups. This is an unexpected and
important finding that should be investigated in the future.
Conclusions
Mobile app follow-up care is suitably targeted to low-risk post-
operative ambulatory patients. Patients using the mobile app
attended 0.40 times fewer in-person visits for follow-up care
and sent more emails to their health care professionals dur-
ing the first 30 days after surgery than did patients in the in-
person follow-up group. The mobile app group was more likely
than the in-person group to agree or strongly agree that their
type of follow-up care was convenient. Complication rates and
patient satisfaction scores were comparable between the
groups. These are important findings given the current de-
mands on the health care system and the push toward patient-
centric care. In the future, we will report on the cost-effective
nature of this solution.
