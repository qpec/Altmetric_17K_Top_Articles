symptoms

Abstract
Background: Research has demonstrated that low fermentable oligosaccharide, disaccharide, monosaccharide and
polyol (FODMAP) diets improve gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms in irritable bowel syndrome sufferers. Exercise-related
GI issues are a common cause of underperformance, with current evidence focusing on the use of FODMAP
approaches with recreationally competitive or highly trained athletes. However, there is a paucity of research
exploring the potential benefit of FODMAP strategies to support healthy, recreational athletes who experience GI
issues during training. This study therefore aimed to assess whether a short-term LOWFODMAP diet improved
exercise-related GI symptoms and the perceived ability to exercise in recreational runners.
Methods: Sixteen healthy volunteers were randomly assigned in a crossover design manner to either a LOWFODMAP
(16.06 ± 1.79 g·d− 1) or HIGHFODMAP (38.65 ± 6.66 g·d− 1) diet for 7 days, with a one week washout period followed by
a further 7 days on the alternate diet. Participants rated their gastrointestinal symptoms on an adapted version of
the Irritable Bowel Syndrome-Severity Scoring System (IBS-SSS) questionnaire before and at the end of each dietary
period. Perceived ability to exercise (frequency, intensity and duration) in relation to each dietary period was also
rated using a visual analogue scale. Resting blood samples were collected prior to and on completion of each diet
to determine plasma intestinal fatty acid binding protein (I-FABP) as a marker of acute GI injury.
Results: Overall IBS-SSS score significantly reduced in the LOWFODMAP condition from 81.1 ± 16.4 to 31.3 ± 9.2
(arbitrary units; P = 0.004). Perceived exercise frequency (z = 2.309, P = 0.02) and intensity (z = 2.687, P = 0.007) was
significantly improved following a short-term LOWFODMAP approach compared to HIGHFODMAP. No significant
differences were reported between dietary conditions for plasma I-FABP (P > 0.05).
Conclusions: A short-term LOWFODMAP diet under free-living conditions reduced exercise-related GI symptoms and
improved the perceived ability to exercise in otherwise healthy, recreational runners. These findings may be
explained by a reduction in indigestible carbohydrates available for fermentation in the gut. The therapeutic
benefits of LOWFODMAP diets in recreational and trained athletes during sustained training periods warrants further
investigation.

 Introduction
Fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosac-
charaides and polyols (FODMAPs) are short-chain carbo-
hydrates that are widespread in the diet in foods such as
fruits, vegetables, dairy, wheat, grains, legumes, and are
commonly added to processed foods to improve palatabil-
ity. The major types of FODMAPs known to be problem-
atic are fructose, lactose, oligosaccharides and polyols,
each of which has a distinct mechanism of action.
Fructose is absorbed in the small intestine by two
carrier protein transporters, GLUT2 (in the presence of
glucose) and GLUT5, which facilitate fructose diffusion
across cell membranes [1, 2]. In some individuals, the
limited availability of the GLUT5 transporter results in
fructose malabsorption when it is present in excess of
glucose [3–7]. Fructose malabsorption is commonly
reported both within irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) suf-
ferers (45%) and healthy individuals (34%) [5]. Lactose
malabsorption occurs when there is insufficient lactase
to break lactose down into its component sugars glucose
and galactose [5].
Oligosaccharides are generally poorly absorbed, result-
ing in the undigested carbohydrates being fermented by
gut bacteria [5, 8, 9]. This results in gas production and
flatulence in both healthy and hypersensitive individuals
which may instigate adverse symptoms [10]. Polyols do
not have an associated active transport system and are
thought to be absorbed by diffusion [6], which is variable
across the intestine and between individuals [11]. If the
polyol is too large for diffusion, malabsorption may occur
[8], resulting in fermentation or an increased osmotic load
leading to fluid retention in the small intestine [12, 13].
Cumulatively, the malabsorption of these short chain
carbohydrates as part of a habitual diet may result in
increased small intestinal water volume which can affect
gut motility [6, 8]. It has previously been established that
altered gut motility is associated with symptoms which
are analogues to IBS and exercise including nausea, diar-
rhoea and urge to defecate during exercise [14, 15]. A
LOWFODMAP diet has been established as an evidence-
based approach to reduce symptoms in approximately
75% of patients diagnosed with IBS [16]. Sixty to 70% of
patients report a worsening of IBS symptoms after habit-
ual meals [17], and consequently will eliminate foods
that they believe trigger their symptoms [18, 19].
It is possible that hypersensitive individuals are more sus-
ceptible to an adverse reaction to a HIGHFODMAP diet a re-
sult of the mechanistic changes during exercise [14, 15, 20,
21] which can ultimately impact on training and/or per-
formance. Increasing the intensity and duration of exercise
corresponds with slower gastric emptying and potential for
structural epithelial damage, tight-junction disruption and
transient luminal permeability, as demonstrated through
acute elevated levels of plasma intestinal-fatty acid binding
protein (I-FABP) [22–24]. It is therefore relevant to con-
sider whether a short-term LOWFODMAP diet impacts on
habitual levels of I-FABP, or indeed whether markers of in-
testinal damage are exacerbated or sustained as a result of a
HIGHFODMAP diet.
It has been reported that 30-50% of athletes cite GI issues
as one of the most common causes of underperformance in
endurance events [15]. This likely explains why athletes may
eliminate food groups they believe cause GI distress [25–
28], with a gluten free diet becoming one of the most com-
mon approaches reported [27]. However, there is little evi-
dence that removal of gluten has any performance benefits
for non-coeliac athletes and it has been suggested that glu-
ten may not be a specific trigger of GI symptoms once diet-
ary intake of FODMAPs are reduced [29]. Recent evidence
has focused on the use of FODMAP approaches to support
recreationally competitive or highly trained athletes. How-
ever, there is a paucity of research exploring the potential
benefit of FODMAP strategies to support healthy, recre-
ational athletes who experience GI issues during endurance
training. Therefore, the purpose of this randomised, cross-
over trial was to investigate the effect of altering FODMAP
intake upon the GI symptoms reported by recreational ath-
letes in free-living conditions during habitual training. It was
hypothesised that a short-term LOWFODMAP diet would im-
prove GI symptoms and the perceived ability to exercise.
Materials/methods
Study design
This study employed a randomised, crossover design. The
study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration
of Helsinki, and ethical approval was granted by the Fac-
ulty of Science and Technology Ethics Committee, Anglia
Ruskin University (Project Number: FST/FREP/15/567).
All participants provided written informed consent prior
to study inclusion. All monitoring procedures took place
in the Cambridge Centre for Sport and Exercise Sciences,
Anglia Ruskin University under controlled conditions.
Participants were required to be healthy, recreationally
active runners (training a minimum of 3 days per week
with at least 3 months habitual experience, and satisfac-
torily complete a health screen questionaire) and pre-
pared to comply with study requirements. Ineligible
participants were those with a known health condition
(including persistent non-exercise related GI issues),
current injury, or recent viral infection. Participants were
required to only eat foods in conjunction with the lists
provided for each 7 day period, and be prepared to weigh
food and keep a detailed food log. All participants re-
ported no known or diagnosed gut disorders, were not
currently following a LOWFODMAP, ketogenic or calorie
restricted diet, were not currently taking antibiotics or
probiotics, and had no known blood disorders or
allergies.

 Participants
An a priori power calculation was undertaken based on
the primary end point being the difference in IBS–SSS be-
fore and after the LOWFODMAP diet. It was estimated that
11 participants were needed per dietary condition to have
an 80% power to detect a difference within group of > 1
SD of IBS-SSS score using a paired t-test with a one-sided
α of 0.05 based on previous data [6]. Participants (n = 19)
were recruited through personal contacts with local run-
ning clubs. One participant withdrew due to the burden
of keeping a weighed food diary and two participants were
excluded from the final analysis due to dietary non-com-
pliance. Sixteen participants completed all aspects of the
study (10 female, 6 male; age: 44 ± 10 years, height: 1.70 ±
0.78 m, body-mass: 69.2 ± 8.8 kg).
Eating plans and dietary intake
According to previous research which categorized carbo-
hydrates as low or high FODMAP [30–33], two separate
food lists were devised for this study containing either
high or low FODMAP foods. To protect the integrity of
the study, participants were instructed to follow the two
diets (with an explanation that the type of carbohydrate
was different) with no specific reference to FODMAPs
in pre study information. For the purposes of protocol
blinding lists were named A and B, although complete
blinding was not feasible. In order to mimic dietary
choice that athletes make in free-living conditions par-
ticipants were free to select foods from the list and were
individually advised to match their typical dietary and
calorie intake and record via a weekly weighed food
diary. Participants were provided with example diaries
and individually instructed in diary completion, with em-
phasis on meal breakdown, portion size/weight and
weighing procedure. Dietary analyses were undertaken
by the same researcher for standardisation using Nutri-
tics Professional Dietary Analysis software (Nutritics
Limited, Dublin).
Experimental procedures
Participants attended the laboratory prior to and imme-
diately after each dietary period, and were requested to
be rested (no exercise) in the 24-hour period prior to all
laboratory measures. For all visits, on arrival, partici-
pants rested for 5 minutes prior to fasted blood sample
collection, and were then required to complete a symp-
tom questionnaire (see below). Participants were rando-
mised
using
a
pseudo-random
number
generator
(www.randomizer.org) to start on either the low or high
FODMAP condition for 7 days based upon previously
reported research [34]. All participants undertook a one
week washout period between conditions (in a similar
manner to previously reported research [10]) and were
requested to return to their normal eating patterns
during this period before undertaking the opposing diet-
ary condition. Prior to starting, and throughout the
study, participants were requested to continue their nor-
mal training routine.
Blood sampling and analysis
Upon arrival, a venous whole blood sample was collected
from participants by a qualified phlebotomist into dupli
cate 4 mL K3EDTA vacutainers (Greiner Bio-One GmbH,
Kremsmunster, Austria). Samples were centrifuged for 10
minutes at 3000 rpm, with aliquotted plasma pipetted into
sterile, non-pyrogenic, polypropylene cyrovials (Fisher-
brand, Fisher Scientific, Loughborough, UK) and immedi-
ately frozen at − 80 °C for later assessment of I-FABP using
an
ELISA
kit
(Hycult
Biotechnology,
Uden,
the
Netherlands; analytical measurement range: 47 to 3000
pg·ml-1; intra-assay variance: 3.2% at 360 pg·ml-1, 5.4% at
557 pg·ml-1 and 6.6% at 809 pg·ml-1). Reagents were pre-
pared in accordance with the manufactures instructions at
room temperature. Duplicate plasma samples were thawed
to room temperature (22 °C) and diluted 10-fold using the
sample dilution buffer. I-FABP was extracted from the
plasma samples by the addition of the following reagents
to ELISA kit in the following order: diluted plasma sam-
ples; diluted tracer; diluted streptavidin-peroxidase. In be-
tween additions the tray was covered with foil, incubated
at room temperature (22 °C) for 1 hour before washing. Fi-
nally tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) substrate was added to
each well and the tray was incubated for 30 minutes at
room temperature. The reaction was stopped with the
addition of the stop solution and gently mixed. Samples
were read on a spectrophotometer at an absorbance of
450 nm (Victir 3 multilabel plate reader, PerkinElmer Inc.,
Llantrisant, UK) and referenced against a calibration curve
(logarithmic scale).
Gastrointestinal symptom monitoring
Prior to, and following each dietary period participants
rated individual GI symptoms (i.e. bloating, abdominal
pain, flatulence, belching, nausea, diarrhoea, defecation,
urge to defecate and constipation) against a standardised
0–100 visual analogue scale (VAS) questionnaire (arbi-
trary units (au)), with no interference from the research
team. Global IBS symptom severity scores (IBS-SSS)
were based on accumulated results. Clinically significant
change of symptoms was defined as > 20 au on the VAS
scale [35]. Participants were also requested to rate their
perception of their ability to exercise over the week in
which each dietary period occurred. Having recorded
their training, participants rated their exercise intensity,
duration and frequency based on a category scale (no
change 0, improved 1, worsened 2) in comparison to a
typical training week. Following this, food diaries were
collected
and
inspected

accuracy,
detail

 compliance using a second pass interview approach be-
tween the researcher and participant.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS (IBM,
Version 24.0). Normality of data were verified by the
Shapiro-Wilks test. Outliers were identified by inspec-
tion of box plots > 1.5 IQR in SPSS. A repeated mea-
sures ANOVA was used to compare effects of dietary
interventions (i.e. nutritional intake, IBS-SSS, I-FABP)
with Bonferroni post-hoc assessment where applicable.
Where sphericity was violated a Greenhouse Geisser
correction was applied. A dependent samples t-test was
carried out to assess relative differences between diets
where pertinent. Ability to exercise data was analysed
using a Wilcoxon signed rank test. An alpha level of P ≤
0.05 was considered statistically significant for all tests.
Data are presented as mean ± SE.
Results
Dietary intake
No significant differences in mean caloric intake were
reported between dietary conditions, or in comparison
to
habitual
intake
(F = 2.921,
P = 0.07,
ηp2 = 0.173;
Table 1). When normalised for body-mass, mean habit-
ual caloric intake (34.12 ± 2.48 kcal·kg− 1·d− 1) was com-
parable with both LOWFODMAP (29.04 ± 1.88 kcal·kg−
1·d− 1)
and
HIGHFODMAP
(32.53 ± 2.08 kcal·kg− 1·d− 1)
conditions (F = 3.053, P = 0.063, ηp2 = 0.179). For carbo-
hydrate intake, a significant main effect was observed (F
= 7.091,
P = 0.0003,
ηp2 = 0.336),
with
participants
reporting consuming less total (Table 1) and relative
carbohydrate intake during the LOWFODMAP condition
compared with the HIGHFODMAP condition (2.79 ± 0.30
g·kg− 1·d− 1 and 3.91 ± 0.36 g·kg− 1·d− 1 respectively, P =
0.003).
Total
FODMAP
intake
(including
relative
to
body-mass) was also statistically different between condi-
tions (F = 10.354, P < 0.0001, ηp2 = 0.425), with post-hoc
analysis
demonstrating
the
expected
reduction
with
LOWFODMAP (15.75 ± 1.91 g·d− 1) compared with both
HIGHFODMAP (38.59 ± 6.48 g·d− 1, P = 0.004) and habitual
conditions (28.04 ± 4.33 g·d− 1, P = 0.045). There were no
significant differences reported for dietary fat (habitual:
1.48 ± 0.17 g·kg− 1·d− 1; LOWFODMAP 1.29 ± 0.15 g·kg− 1·d−
1; HIGHFODMAP 1.21 ± 0.08 g·kg− 1·d− 1; F = 1.446, P =
0.253) or protein intake (habitual: 1.34 ± 0.10 g·kg− 1·d− 1;
LOWFODMAP 1.35 ± 0.70 g·kg− 1·d− 1; HIGHFODMAP 1.36 ±
0.08 g·kg− 1·d− 1; F = 0.142, P = 0.798) between experimen-
tal conditions or in comparison to habitual intake (total or
relative to body-mass).
Gastrointestinal symptom scores (overall)
Mean gastrointestinal symptom scores (IBS-SSS) did not dif-
fer between conditions prior to each FODMAP diet (P >
0.05), although a wide variance of responses was noted be-
tween participants (mean: 66.1 ± 16.3 au; range 0–206 au).
A significant diet x time interaction effect was found for
IBS-SSS (F = 6.98, P = 0.02, ηp2 = 0.32), with post-hoc ana-
lysis indicating a significant reduction in scores from 81.1 ±
16.4 au (pre) to 31.3 ± 9.2 au (post) with LOWFODMAP (P =
0.004; Fig. 1). Although a non-significant increase in
IBS-SSS was reported with HIGHFODMAP from 51.1 ± 15.7
au (pre) to 104.0 ± 25.0 au (post; P = 0.08); overall end-point
scores were significantly different between dietary conditions
(P = 0.007). Expressed as relative change (Fig. 2), a significant
difference was also reported between dietary conditions
(mean difference = − 102.7 ± 38.9 au; t = − 2.64, P = 0.02) in
favour of an improvement in responses following a LOW-
FODMAP approach. Individual responses indicated that 69%
of participants (11/16) reported positive effects of the LOW-
FODMAP diet, in contrast to 25% (4/16) on the HIGHFODMAP
diet.

 Gastrointestinal symptom scores (individual)
Table 2 demonstrates mean responses to individual GI
symptoms across both dietary conditions. A significant
diet x time interaction effect was found for pain (F =
6.861, P = 0.019, ηp2 = 0.314) with post hoc analyses indi-
cating that end-point scores were significantly different
between dietary conditions (4.13 ± 2.52 au for LOWFOD-
MAP and 22.50 ± 6.35 au for HIGHFODMAP respectively, P
= 0.003), which coincided with significant within-group
changes for both LOWFODMAP (P = 0.031) and HIGHFOD-
MAP (P = 0.028). A significant main effect (time) was re-
ported for flatulence (F = 4.428, P = 0.05, ηp2 = 0.228), as
well as a main effect (diet) for belching (F = 5.686, P =
0.03, ηp2 = 0.275), although post-hoc analyses were not
significant. A significant main effect (diet) was reported
for
bloating
(F = 6.186,
P = 0.025,
ηp2 = 0.292),
with
post-hoc analyses indicating that end-point scores were
significantly different between dietary conditions (1.25 ±
0.72 au for LOWFODMAP and 12.69 ± 4.53au for HIGH-
FODMAP respectively, P = 0.021). All symptoms except con-
stipation and defecation recorded a decrease in score on
the LOWFODMAP, whilst all symptoms except flatulence
recorded an increase in score on the HIGHFODMAP diet,
however no other significant findings were reported.
FODMAP intake and self-reported ability to exercise
There was a statistically significant median difference in
the perceived exercise frequency (z = 2.309, P = 0.02) and
intensity (z = 2.687, P = 0.007) between a LOWFODMAP
and HIGHFODMAP diet. No significant median difference
was reported in perceived exercise duration on a LOW-
FODMAP and HIGHFODMAP diet (z = 1.414, P = 0.157).
Participants were more likely to report that the ability to
exercise improved on a LOWFODMAP diet (frequency (4/
16), intensity (6/16)), and deteriorated on a HIGHFOD-
MAP diet (frequency (4/16), intensity (9/16)).
FODMAP intake and intestinal fatty acid binding protein
(I-FABP) levels
The effect of both FODMAP diets on I-FABP levels under
resting conditions is shown in Fig. 3. A non-significant
increase from 206.93 ± 7.27 pg·ml− 1 to 219.46 ± 10.42 pg·
ml− 1 was noted for LOWFODMAP remaining within ex-
pected limits. I-FABP for HIGHFODMAP remained com-
parable across the intervention (218.21 ± 10.93 pg·ml− 1 to
222.60 ± 13.08 pg·ml− 1; P > 0.05). No significant inter-
action effects were reported (P > 0.05) between dietary
conditions.
Discussion
This study aimed to investigate the perceived effect of
acute FODMAP intake on GI symptom severity and abil-
ity to exercise in recreational athletes under free-living
conditions. Whilst the clinical effectiveness of a LOWFOD-
MAP diet in treating IBS is established in the literature [16,
28], research into the potential therapeutic effects in
otherwise healthy, recreational athletes is limited. The
main findings from the current study revealed that
short-term LOWFODMAP intake significantly improved
exercise-related GI symptoms in 69% of participants.
These results support recent observations [36] demon-
strating reductions in daily GI symptoms in trained ath-
letes on a short-term (6-day) LOWFODMAP diet, as well as
reduced GI symptom severity in case studies of a male
[37] and female [38] runner. Consistency between these
findings infers that both recreational and more trained
athletes may benefit from self-prescribed LOWFODMAP
approaches in the short-term, providing there is compli-
ance with food choices. This may have implications for

 longer term FODMAP strategies during sustained training
periods, which may provide adjunct nutritional support in
maintaining training volume and/or intensity [20] particu-
larly in symptomatic individuals who suffer from GI dis-
tress with exercise.
Whilst a LOWFODMAP approach appeared to result in
improved scores for most individual symptoms, only re-
sponses to perceived pain and bloating were significantly
different between conditions following the dietary inter-
ventions. This suggests that whilst an improvement in
overall GI symptom severity may reflect accumulated re-
ductions in individual symptom responses, the effects of
a short-term LOWFODMAP diet may in fact be specific.
The reported improvement in perceived pain, in con-
junction with reduced experiences of bloating whilst on
a LOWFODMAP diet is likely explained by a reduction in
intestinal water volume and gas production [6, 10, 39].
Strategies to reduce or minimise such GI symptoms may
be
important
for
recreational
athletes,
especially
considering the reported negative impact on exercise
training and/ or performance [15, 40, 41]. However,
based on the wide inter-individual responses observed
across conditions, such findings should be interpreted
with caution.
An interesting observation from the current study was
the improved perception of exercise frequency and in-
tensity from participants whilst undertaking the LOW-
FODMAP approach. Although this only reflected perceived
changes in the short-term (7 days), this may have impli-
cations for sustained approaches where training routines
may be disrupted (including volume and intensity) due
to GI-related issues. Participants were requested to
maintain their typical training routine throughout the
study to assess whether perceived changes (in frequency,
training duration or intensity) were related to the dietary
intervention. Whilst a significant effect was observed for
improved perception of exercise frequency and intensity
following a LOWFODMAP approach, this only occurred in
25 and 38% of the participants respectively. Only one
other study [36] appears to have attempted to standard-
ise training sessions (albeit 2 sessions in a 6-day period)
whilst participants undertook an acute LOWFODMAP or
HIGHFODMAP diet. In this study, daily GI symptoms for
flatulence, urge to defecate and diarrhoea were report-
edly improved in the LOWFODMAP condition [36]. How-
ever, assessment of participants’ perception of training
session ability in relation to the dietary approach was
not considered. Further research to establish training re-
lated benefits of a LOWFODMAP strategy, particularly
with symptomatic individuals, is therefore warranted.
Moderate to high-intensity exercise impacts on gastric
emptying, GI transit and intestinal absorption due to GI
hypoperfusion and ischemia [15, 22]. Provocation of
luminal tight junction proteins (e.g. caludin and occlu-
din) through increased expression of phosphorylation

 [22, 23, 42] and paracellular transport. Although transi-
ent, acute GI disruption may exacerbate nutrient malab-
sorption, as well as provoke delayed systemic immune
responses. Increased residual HIGHFODMAP GI content
as a result of malabsorption [43], along with increased
delivery of fluid to the colon and reduced GI motility
could synergistically impact on perceived severity of
symptoms, including acute or transient pain. This may
limit the intensity of exercise training, particularly in
symptomatic or hypersensitive individuals. The reduc-
tion in pain observed in this study, along with improved
perception
of
flatulence
and
bloating
symptoms
within-group, indicates that lowering FODMAPs in the
diet may support exercise training. Mechanistically, a re-
duction in fluid re-uptake across the GI epithelia, lead-
ing to less fluid and gas build-up pre- or during exercise
in response to daily or more habitual LOWFODMAP ap-
proaches may assist with sustained exercise tolerance.
In connection with perceived symptom changes, this
study also investigated whether a short-term FODMAP
approach impacted on basal GI damage via assessment
of I-FABP. Whilst it was hypothesised that a HIGHFOD-
MAP diet may lead to an elevated residual level of
I-FABP following the short-term intervention, no signifi-
cant differences were observed within or between condi-
tions. Therefore, even though a HIGHFODMAP approach
may have resulted in increased perception of symptom
severity, disruption of the epithelial barrier in response
to dietary modifications was not evident. Previous re-
search has demonstrated that splanchnic hypoperfusion
in response to acute, moderate exercise resulted in ele-
vated I-FABP from 309 ± 46 pg·ml− 1 to 615 ± 118 pg·ml−
1
in
healthy,
male
volunteers
[22],
which
rapidly
returned to baseline concentrations within minutes of
recovery. I-FABP is a sensitive marker of small intestinal
cell damage. However, rapid changes as observed in the
previous study [22] indicate that GI damage is highly
transient, and possibly only in response to exercise-
based hypoperfusion, which may explain the lack of sig-
nificant residual findings under resting conditions in the
current study. Assessment of I-FABP and/or GI perme-
ability (e.g. urinary lactulose: rhamanose evaluation) in
response to daily bouts of exercise in conjunction with a
FODMAP approach may, however, provide mechanistic
understanding of the potential benefits of a LOWFOD-
MAP diet.
A limitation to the current study observed when
implementing a LOWFODMAP diet in free-living condi-
tions was that participants tended to consume fewer cal-
ories compared to both habitual and HIGHFODMAP
intakes, albeit non-significant. Taking into consideration
methodological constraints in maintaining a weighed
food diary, this observation was supported by a signifi-
cant
reduction
in
carbohydrate
intake
to
achieve
LOWFODMAP adherence. This finding is consistent with
a case study of a female athlete competing in a Multi-
stage Ultramarathon [38], which reported that whilst fol-
lowing a LOWFODMAP approach total daily energy intake
did not meet estimated energy requirements. Upon fur-
ther investigation suboptimal carbohydrate intake rather
than protein and fat was observed.
Similar findings have been reported elsewhere [44], in
which 29% of participants reported acute weight loss
whilst on a LOWFODMAP approach in free-living condi-
tions. Many carbohydrate-rich foods typically consumed
by active individuals (e.g. pasta, cereals, bread, energy
drinks)
are
HIGHFODMAP,
whereas
alternative
food
sources (e.g. rice, corn) may be less palatable or more
difficult to substitute. Indeed, in the previous study [44],
participants cited that LOWFODMAP approaches were ei-
ther too complicated, expensive, or did not enjoy the
overall taste as reasons for not sustaining the diet. The
potentially restrictive or limiting nature of food choices
on a LOWFODMAP diet could therefore outweigh GI
symptom benefits in the longer term due to weight loss,
lethargy, fatigue, perceived effort, cost and/or enjoyment.
Furthermore, a sustained energy/carbohydrate reduction
in the longer term could also impact on training main-
tenance and recovery adaptations, and lead to unin-
tended reduced nutrient availability.
However, the finding that acute dietary FODMAP ma-
nipulation positively impacted on overall GI symptom
severity has pertinent implications for active individuals,
particularly those more symptomatic or hypersensitive.
Future research should consider whether there is a
threshold of symptom severity in the context of exercise
above which individuals may benefit from a LOWFOD-
MAP nutritional approach. There is also the need to es-
tablish the minimum intervention length required to
alleviate GI symptoms in both recreational and trained
athletes; as well as how long interventions can be sus-
tained or indeed whether a FODMAP approach can
impact on prolonged training periods. This is especially
important considering the finding that carbohydrate
intake
was
reduced
on
the
LOWFODMAP
diet
in
free-living conditions, and the known importance of car-
bohydrates in fuelling regular exercise. Finally, whilst a
LOWFODMAP diet is known to significantly affect the gut
microflora composition [45–47], the consequences of
prolonged LOWFODMAP intake on other types of physical
activity, particularly those of a high-intensity or intermit-
tent nature, has yet to be determined.
Conclusion
In conclusion, this study provides evidence that recre-
ational athletes implementing a short-term LOWFODMAP
diet under free-living conditions may experience benefits
in
exercise-related
GI
symptoms
and
perceived

 improvements in exercise intensity and frequency. How-
ever, caution is warranted to minimise unnecessary re-
ductions in total caloric and/or carbohydrate intake that
may impact on nutritional quality. Further studies are
warranted to investigate the impact of a LOWFODMAP
diet on sustained training strategies in healthy, recre-
ationally active individuals and trained athletes.
