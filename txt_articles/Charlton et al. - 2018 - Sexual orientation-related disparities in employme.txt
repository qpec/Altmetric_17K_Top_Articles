Objective To investigate sexual orientation-related 
disparities in employment and healthcare, including 
potential contributions to health-related quality of life 
(HRQL).
setting Growing Up Today Study, a USA-based 
longitudinal cohort that began in 1996; predominantly 
composed of participants who are white and of middle-to-
high socioeconomic positions.
Participants 9914 participants 18–32 years old at the 
most recent follow-up questionnaire.
Primary outcome measure In 2013, participants 
reported if, in the last year, they had been unemployed, 
uninsured or lacked healthcare access (routine physical 
exam). Participants completed the EQ-5D-5L, a validated, 
preference-weighted measurement of HRQL. After 
adjusting for potential confounders, we used sex-stratified, 
log-binomial models to calculate the association of 
sexual orientation with employment, health insurance 
and healthcare access, while examining if these variables 
attenuated the sexual orientation-related HRQL disparities.
results Sexual minority women and men were 
about twice as likely as their respective heterosexual 
counterparts to have been unemployed and uninsured. 
For example, the risk ratio (95% CI) of uninsured bisexual 
women was 3.76 (2.42 to 5.85) and of unemployed 
mostly heterosexual men was 1.82 (1.30 to 2.54). 
Routine physical examination was not different across 
sexual orientation groups (p>0.05). All sexual minority 
subgroups had worse HRQL than heterosexuals (p<0.05) 
across the five EQ-5D-5L dimensions (mobility, self-care, 
usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression). 
Controlling for employment and health insurance did not 
substantially attenuate the existing sexual orientation-
related HRQL disparities.
Conclusions Research on sexual orientation-related 
disparities in employment and healthcare has often been 
limited to comparisons between cohabitating different-sex 
and same-sex adult couples, overlooking sexual minority 
subgroups (eg, bisexuals vs lesbians), non-cohabitating 
populations and young people. Less is known about sexual 
orientation-related disparities in HRQL including potential 
contributions from employment and healthcare. The 
current study documents that disparities in employment, 
health insurance and various HRQL dimensions are 
pervasive across sexual minority subgroups, non-
cohabitating couples and youth in families of middle-to-
high socioeconomic positions.
IntrOduCtIOn 
Nearly half of all sexual minorities (eg, 
lesbian, gay and bisexual individuals) report 
employment discrimination in their life-
time.1 Discrimination, along with other social 
and economic barriers, can lead to unem-
ployment, and subsequently lack of health 
insurance and healthcare access. All of these 
strengths and limitations of this study
 
► The cohort has predominantly high social status, 
so while the findings can examine sexual orienta-
tion-related differences, they may underestimate 
the prevalence of unemployment, lack of health 
insurance, lack of healthcare access and poor 
health-related quality of life (HRQL) compared with 
other populations (eg, low social status, elderly).
 
► There may be other factors that mediate the sexual 
orientation-related HRQL disparities, including bully-
ing victimisation, social status and others.
 
► Data were cross-sectional and limited on some of 
our variables, such as health insurance and health-
care access.
 
► The study includes a large sample drawn from 
young adults living across the USA.
 
► This is the first study to examine the disparities 
across HRQL domains and to evaluate the role of 
additional factors including employment, health in-
surance and healthcare access.

factors may contribute to poor health-related quality of 
life (HRQL), which is a critical measure of health status. 
Comparing HRQL across different subpopulations can 
highlight disparities, as well as help to evaluate the cost-ef-
fectiveness of policies or programmes that reduce such 
disparities.2 
Previous research has documented that, compared 
with heterosexuals, sexual minorities are more likely to 
be unemployed, lack health insurance and lack health-
care access.3–13 However, these data are often limited to 
comparisons between cohabitating different-sex couples 
and same-sex adult couples, which precludes examination 
of differences in any other aspects such as among sexual 
minority subgroups (eg, bisexuals vs lesbians), non-co-
habitating groups or young people. A few previous studies 
have also revealed that sexual minorities, on average, have 
worse quality of life than heterosexuals.14–19 But most of 
these data depend on limited measures of quality of life, 
including measures such as the Medical Outcomes Study 
36-Item Short-Form Health Survey, which does not explic-
itly assess HRQL, including its multiple dimensions (eg, 
pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression). Additionally, few 
of these studies have examined potential mediators of the 
sexual orientation-related disparities in HRQL.
Documenting such disparities can provide policymakers 
with evidence to inform legislation that can lessen health 
inequities. For example, over half of the states across the 
USA currently have no employment non-discrimination 
law covering sexual orientation20. Using research to docu-
ment the downstream consequences of unemployment—
health insurance, healthcare access and HRQL—can 
aid policymakers in crafting the necessary legal changes 
to lessen these inequities, such as federal employment 
non-discrimination laws. Therefore, the goal of this 
study was to leverage data from a USA-based longitudinal 
cohort of adolescents and young adults (ages 18–32) to 
examine sexual orientation-related disparities in employ-
ment, health insurance and healthcare access, while eval-
uating their contributions to HRQL disparities.
MethOds
study population
For the last 20 years, questionnaire data have been 
collected annually in the Growing Up Today Study (GUTS) 
from the female and male offspring of the Nurses’ Health 
Study 2 (NHS2) participants. The first wave of GUTS 
participants (GUTS1) was enrolled in 1996, when they 
were 9–14 years of age, and another wave aged 9–16 years 
old was enrolled in 2004 (GUTS2), making the entire 
cohort 18–32 years of age at the last questionnaire wave 
in 2013. We originally sent questionnaires to GUTS1 
and GUTS2 in alternating years, but since 2013 we have 
combined GUTS1 and GUTS2 into a single annual ques-
tionnaire. Participants’ race/ethnicity is primarily white, 
and most of their families report a middle-to-high house-
hold income (64% of participants had an annual house-
hold income during their childhood of ≥$75 000).
The current analysis was limited to GUTS participants 
who reported their sexual orientation and information 
on measures of unemployment, health insurance, health-
care access and HRQL between baseline and at the end of 
follow-up in 2013 (n=9914).
Measures
Sexual orientation
Detailed information about sexual orientation has been 
repeatedly collected in GUTS1 and GUTS2 using an item 
adapted from the Minnesota Adolescent Health Survey,21 
which asks about feelings of attraction and identity. The 
item reads ‘Which of the following best describes your 
feelings?’ with the following response options: completely 
heterosexual (attracted to persons of the opposite sex), 
mostly heterosexual, bisexual (equally attracted to men 
and women), mostly homosexual, completely homo-
sexual (gay/lesbian, attracted to persons of the same sex) 
and not sure.
Sexual orientation groups were modelled using the 
2013 questionnaire data (the same questionnaire year 
as the latest outcome) as follows: completely hetero-
sexual (reference group), mostly heterosexual, bisexual 
and lesbian/gay (made up from the mostly homosexual 
and completely homosexual groups). Missing data were 
limited and imputed from previous questionnaire waves. 
Respondents endorsing ‘not sure’ were excluded (n=69).
Unemployment
In 2010 (GUTS1 only) and 2013, participants reported 
their employment status. Response options included 
working full time, working part-time, student, volun-
teering, military, unemployed/laid off/looking for work, 
staying at home with children/taking care of family, 
on maternity or family leave, and not working due to 
illness or disability. We categorised participants as being 
unemployed/not working due to illness or disability 
in 2013 if they provided an affirmative response to the 
‘unemployed/laid off/looking for work’ item or the ‘not 
working due to illness or disability’ item.
Lacking health insurance
The 2013 questionnaire asked participants whether 
they were covered by any kind of health insurance or 
healthcare plan (yes; no). We categorised participants as 
lacking health insurance in 2013 if they reported no such 
coverage.
Lacking healthcare access through routine physical exam
The use of routine physical exams was measured by 
asking about the timing of the last routine physical exam 
in 2013. We categorised participants who reported their 
last routine physical exam occurred >12 months before 
the questionnaire completion as not having healthcare 
access through a routine physical exam.
Health-related quality of life
The 2013 questionnaire assessed HRQL using the 
EQ-5D-5L,22 which is a validated, preference-weighted

measure. EQ-5D-5L is a standardised, generic instrument 
that is applicable to a wide range of health conditions and 
appropriate for use with adolescents and young adults. 
This measure can also be used to calculate quality-ad-
justed life years for economic analyses with USA-based 
population weights.
EQ-5D-5L assesses HRQL in five dimensions (mobility, 
self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/
depression) by having participants report a dimen-
sion-specific score (1=no problems, 2=slight problems, 
3=moderate problems, 4=severe problems and 5=extreme 
problems). Based on the EuroQol Group recommenda-
tions,23 each physical functioning dimension was dichot-
omised into a score of 1  being ‘no problems’ vs scores of 
2–5 being ‘any problems’. The anxiety/depression dimen-
sion was dichotomised into scores of 1–2 being ‘none or 
slight problems’ vs scores of 3–5 being ‘moderate, severe, 
or extreme problems’, as has been done previously.24
All five dimensions were then used to create a summary 
HRQL index score.25 Because EQ-5D-5L value sets are not 
yet available for the USA, in order to preference-weight 
the index score for US populations we relied on another 
value set to map the EQ-5D-5L responses to the previous 
version, the EQ-5D-3L.26 This summary results in an 
index score that is calibrated to reflect the degree to 
which different health statuses are valued in the US popu-
lation overall. The index scores for the US population 
range from the most severe impairment on all five dimen-
sions, termed ‘worse than death’ (value=−0.109), to full 
health (value=1.0).27 Previous research suggests that an 
index score difference as small as 0.02 points can have a 
clinically meaningful difference.28 We also analysed the 
HRQL index score after dichotomising it as a score of 1 
being ‘full health’ vs <1 being ‘not full health’.
Confounders
Potential confounders included baseline age in years, 
race/ethnicity (white, another race/ethnicity), childhood 
socioeconomic position (annual household income from 
the NHS2 report in 2001 (<$50 000, $50 000–$74 999, 
$75 000–$99 999, ≥$100 000)), sex/gender, marital status 
in 2013 (married, not married), region of residence 
(West, Midwest, South or Northeast) and cohort (GUTS1, 
GUTS2). If a participant’s data were missing for potential 
confounders, data were imputed from previous question-
naire years; if no such data were available for a partici-
pant, then multiple imputation procedures were used.
statistical analysis
We first examined cross-sectional mean differences in 
employment, health insurance, healthcare access and 
HRQL measures across sexual orientation groups. Multi-
variate regression from log-binomial models was used 
for dichotomous outcomes to calculate risk ratios (RR) 
and 95% CIs. Linear regression with the robust sandwich 
estimator was used for continuous outcomes to calculate 
the betas (β) and SEs. In order to account for sibling 
clusters, we estimated the variance using generalised 
estimating equations with a compound symmetry working 
correlation matrix.
We calculated the RRs of experiencing unemployment, 
lacking health insurance or lacking healthcare access by 
sexual orientation groups (referent=completely hetero-
sexual), adjusted for potential confounders. Anal-
yses for HRQL measures followed the previously used 
two-step approach,29 30 by first dichotomising the index 
score (1 vs <1) and then using the continuous health 
index score in analyses restricted to those with lower 
HRQL (defined as health index scores <1). HRQL 
models were first adjusted for potential confounders, 
and then adjusted for employment, health insurance 
and healthcare access to explore attenuation. Previous 
research with this cohort14 suggests possible effect 
modification of the sexual orientation and HRQL asso-
ciation by sex/gender but not by cohort, so all analyses 
were stratified by sex/gender and adjusted for cohort. 
Analyses were conducted using SAS V.9.3.
Patient and public involvement
The public, including patients and study participants, 
was not involved in setting the research question or the 
outcome measures, nor was the public involved in devel-
oping plans for the study design, recruitment or imple-
mentation. The GUTS research results are regularly 
reported to study participants, including through news-
letters and other communications.
results
Of the 9914 participants in our sample, 7.5% were unem-
ployed or not working due to illness or disability, 4.9% 
were uninsured, and 38.2% lacked healthcare access 
through a routine physical exam in the last year. As shown 
in table 1, all of these outcomes varied by sexual orienta-
tion identity, with sexual minorities having more unem-
ployment, less health insurance and less healthcare access 
(all p values <0.01, except among men, where healthcare 
access was not statistically different across sexual orienta-
tion groups). The mean HRQL index score was 0.90 for 
women and 0.92 for men and varied by sexual orienta-
tion identity, with sexual minorities having lower mean 
HRQL index scores compared with completely hetero-
sexuals among both women and men (p<0.001). Within 
each of the five HRQL domains, sexual minority women 
and men were more likely than heterosexuals to report 
worse health (p values ranged from <0.001 to 0.02, except 
among men, where self-care was not statistically different 
across sexual orientation groups).
Table 2 presents the RRs and 95% CIs for the association 
between sexual orientation and the risk of being unem-
ployed, lacking health insurance or lacking healthcare 
access, adjusted for potential confounders. Compared 
with heterosexuals, sexual minority women and men 
were about twice as likely as their respective heterosexual 
counterparts to have been unemployed and uninsured.

attenuate the associations between sexual orientation 
and HRQL.
Table 4 presents the results for the multivariable linear 
regression of HRQL restricted to those with less than full 
health (index score <1). The patterns were similar to 
those provided in table 3, with sexual minorities having 
lower HRQL compared with their completely hetero-
sexual peers, and these relationships were not substan-
tially attenuated after accounting for the effects of 
unemployment, lacking health insurance and lacking a 
routine physical exam.
dIsCussIOn
Sexual minority women and men are more likely than 
heterosexuals to have been unemployed and uninsured 
in early adulthood. Within each of the five HRQL dimen-
sions, sexual minorities were also more likely than their 
heterosexual peers to report worse health. These dispari-
ties are pervasive in a US population that predominantly 
holds high social status with regard to race/ethnicity and 
socioeconomic position.
The existing literature on sexual orientation-re-
lated employment disparities primarily focuses on its 
contribution to more poverty among sexual minori-
ties compared with heterosexuals.4–6 13 Sexual minority 
women, as well as sexual minority people of colour, 
appear to be especially vulnerable to poverty. Badgett 
and Schneebaum5 documented that policies to reduce 
wage gaps between heterosexual men and various sexual 
minority groups, including women and people of colour, 
can significantly reduce poverty. Although there is limited 
research on sexual orientation and employment status, 
data from the 2010 American Community Survey compare 
male same-sex couples and female same-sex couples 
with different-sex couples, all of which are cohabitating. 
These data reveal that cohabitating women in same-sex 
couples are more likely than women or men in cohabi-
tating different-sex couples to be unemployed or not in 
the labour force. An estimated 40.4% of cohabitating 
women in same-sex couples were unemployed or not 
in the workforce compared with 21.8% of cohabitating 
men in same-sex relationships and 25.5% of cohabitating 
women and men in different-sex couples. Women in 
same-sex couples benefit the least from employment as a 
way out of poverty because even among employed groups, 
women are at the highest risk of being in poverty.6 The

findings of the present study support these data, revealing 
higher unemployment among sexual minority women 
compared with heterosexual women. We also found 
larger employment disparities among sexual minority 
men, possibly because our sample was not restricted to 
cohabitating participants.
Other studies have documented sexual orientation-re-
lated disparities in health insurance and healthcare access. 
For example, one of the largest nationally representative 
samples recently revealed that women in same-sex rela-
tionships were significantly less likely than women in 
different-sex relationships to have health insurance or 
to have had a check-up in the last year. Men in same-sex 
relationships in that sample were also less likely than men 
in different-sex relationships to have health insurance 
but more likely to have a check-up in the last year.7 The 
present study supports most of the same patterns and a 
similar magnitude of health insurance and healthcare 
access disparities. A number of other studies document 
these same health insurance and healthcare access dispar-
ities using a cohabitating-based approach,3 9 11 12 and these 
results have also been repeated in other non-cohabitating 
samples as well.4 8 10 However, many of these studies use 
samples that have limited statistical power, collapse sexual 
minority subgroups (eg, lesbians and bisexuals) and are 
restricted to older adults who are in cohabitating relation-
ships. The present study overcomes those challenges with 
a large sample allowing for improved statistical power and 
stratified sexual minority subgroups during late adoles-
cent and early adulthood.
Our findings support the previous research that has 
identified lower HRQL among sexual minorities14–19 
using other quality of life measures.31–35 Bisexual and 
lesbian women in the USA-based NHS2 cohort had 
lower HRQL scores than heterosexuals.15 Certain sexual 
minority groups, including bisexual women and hetero-
sexual men with same-sex partners, had lower HRQL 
scores than their heterosexual peers without same-sex 
partners in the state-based Representative California 
Quality of Life Survey.16 Men who have sex with men in 
a Swedish sample had lower psychosocial HRQL scores 
than their heterosexual peers.17 Other studies among 
college students have also identified lower quality of 
life among sexual minority women and men, including 
one sample from Nigeria18 and another from Cuba, 
Norway, India and South Africa.19 Another study from a 
USA-based sample in Washington state was restricted to 
sexual minorities, and therefore lacked a heterosexual 
comparison group; in this sample, young bisexual women 
had worse HRQL than their lesbian peers, but these 
patterns reversed during mid-life when lesbians had 
worse HRQL.36 Research on sexual orientation-related 
HRQL disparities using the EQ-5D-5L is scarce, but this 
measure was used in two recent publications, one from 
the GUTS cohort14 and another based on a sample in 
Barcelona, Spain.37 The current findings support these 
two publications’ findings that sexual minorities partic-
ipants presented worse HRQL than heterosexuals, and 
the current study also adds new insights. For example, 
the previous GUTS publication did not include estimates 
of the different HRQL dimensions—nor the contribu-
tion from employment and healthcare—and the Spanish 
sample was not large enough to examine sexual minority 
subgroups.
In addition to the differences observed in the current 
study comparing sexual minorities with heterosexuals, 
there were also notable differences comparing men and 
women, as well as across sexual orientation subgroups. 
Male participants were more likely than female partic-
ipants to have lacked a physical exam within the last 
year, but less likely than female participants to have 
experienced pain/discomfort (one of the five HRQL 
dimensions). These patterns align with existing liter-
ature on men being less likely than women to seek 
healthcare,38 and the prevalence of pain that women 
experience compared with men.39 While the primary 
analyses examined sexual minority subgroups in rela-
tion to the completely heterosexual group, some striking 
patterns emerged comparing sexual minority subgroups 
with one another. For example, bisexual women were the 
most likely to have been uninsured (13.8%) compared 
with completely heterosexual (3.9%) women, as well as 
compared with mostly heterosexual (5.7%) and lesbian 
(4.4%) women (p<0.001). These findings align with the 
literature documenting that bisexuals often experience 
some of the highest burdens of adverse health, even 
compared with other sexual minority subgroups.40
The GUTS cohort is made up of children of the NHS2 
participants, so the results in this sample may not gener-
alise to other populations; this cohort is predominantly 
of white race/ethnicity, their mothers are all nurses 
and the annual household income of the majority of 
the participants during their childhood was ≥$75 000. 
Given this high social status, our estimates may underes-
timate the prevalence of unemployment, lack of health 
insurance, lack of healthcare access and poor HRQL. 
However, the fact that these disparities are pervasive 
in a cohort that predominantly holds high social status 
is striking. While our focus was on employment, health 
insurance and healthcare access, there may be other 
factors that mediate the sexual orientation-related HRQL 
disparities, including bullying victimisation, social status 
and others.14 The lack of explanation in these disparities 
by HRQL in this cohort may be due to the participants’ 
young age. Future research should explore how employ-
ment and healthcare may interact with age to drive worse 
HRQL as people age. Data were cross-sectional and 
limited on some of our variables such as health insurance 
and healthcare access. Future longitudinal studies could 
explore more detailed types of health insurance coverage 
as well as other measurements of healthcare access.
This study has a number of strengths, including the 
large sample drawn from young adults living across the 
USA. Building off the recently published data of sexual 
orientation-related disparities of HRQL index scores,14 
this is the first study to examine these disparities across

HRQL domains and sexual minority subgroups while 
also evaluating the role of additional factors including 
employment, health insurance and healthcare access. 
Using the EQ-5D-5L to measure HRQL allows the find-
ings to be incorporated into cost-effectiveness research, 
which can inform public policy decisions.
These sexual orientation-related disparities in employ-
ment and health insurance in a population with high 
social status highlight the ubiquity of sexual orientation 
inequities in the employment and healthcare systems. The 
US Supreme Court’s recent expansion of marriage rights 
to adults nationwide in same-sex relationships should 
lessen some of the sexual orientation-related disparities in 
health insurance. However, the adverse effects of previous 
bans are likely to persist.41 42 Additionally, 28 states across 
the USA currently have no employment non-discrimina-
tion law covering sexual orientation—3 of these states 
have laws preventing the passage or enforcement of local 
non-discrimination laws.20 Until all people, regardless of 
sexual orientation, are treated equally in the eyes of the 
law, including with non-discrimination laws protecting 
employment as well as housing, public accommodations 
and credit/lending, sexual orientation-related health 
disparities will persist.
