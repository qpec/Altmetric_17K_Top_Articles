Objective To examine trends in population exposure 
to secondhand smoke (SHS) and consider two exposure 
metrics as appropriate targets for tobacco control policy-
makers.
Design Comparison of adult non-smokers’ salivary 
cotinine data available from 11 Scottish Health Surveys 
between 1998 and 2016.
Methods The proportions of non-smoking adults who 
had measurable levels of cotinine in their saliva were 
calculated for the 11 time points. The geometric mean 
(GM) concentrations of cotinine levels were calculated 
using Tobit regression. Changes in both parameters 
were assessed for the whole period and also for the 
years since implementation of smoke-free legislation in 
Scotland in 2006.
results Salivary cotinine expressed as a GM fell from 
0.464 ng/mL (95% CI 0.444 to 0.486 ng/mL) in 1998 to 
0.013 ng/mL (95% CI 0.009 to 0.020 ng/mL) in 2016: 
a reduction of 97.2%. The percentage of non-smoking 
adults who had no measurable cotinine in their saliva 
increased by nearly sixfold between 1998 (12.5%, 
95% CI 11.5% to 13.6%) and 2016 (81.6%, 95% CI 
78.6% to 84.6%). Reductions in population exposure to 
SHS have continued even after smoke-free legislation in 
2006.
Conclusions Scotland has witnessed a dramatic 
reduction in SHS exposure in the past two decades, but 
there are still nearly one in five non-smoking adults who 
have measurable exposure to SHS on any given day. 
Tobacco control strategies globally should consider the 
use of both the proportion of non-smoking adults with 
undetectable salivary cotinine and the GM as targets to 
encourage policies that achieve a smoke-free future.
InTrODuCTIOn
Globally, exposure to secondhand smoke (SHS) 
continues to be a major cause of mortality and 
ill health with recent estimates suggesting it 
accounts for nearly 600 
000 deaths and approaching 
11 
million disability-adjusted life years annually.1 
One of the key principles of article 8 of WHO 
Framework Convention on Tobacco Control is that 
‘all people should be protected from exposure to 
tobacco smoke.’2 
Smoke-free legislation has been introduced in 
many developed countries in the past decade with 
the focus on protecting workers and non-smokers 
from exposure to SHS in enclosed public spaces.3 
This has been shown to be successful in reducing 
concentrations of SHS in many settings4 5 and to 
have consequent public health benefits.6 7 However, 
much less effort has been expended on reducing 
exposure to SHS in homes, and there is some 
evidence that practitioners and policy-makers feel 
that the ‘SHS problem’ has been addressed and 
solved.8
Scotland has a rich source of data on popula-
tion exposure to SHS with the Scottish Health 
Survey taking place on 11 occasions between 1995 
and 2016. This comprehensive nationwide survey 
captures data from across Scotland with sample 
sizes typically in the range of 4000–9000 adults. 
The 2015 Scottish Health Survey report9 presented 
summary details of salivary cotinine concentrations 
of all non-smoking adults who provided a valid saliva 
sample spanning surveys from 2003 to 2015. Using 
a value of 0.05 
ng/mL, representing one-half of the 
analytical method limit of detection (LOD=0.1 
ng/
mL), for all samples that were below this LOD the 
report provided a geometric mean (GM) value for 
all non-smoking adults. There is considerable debate 
in the exposure science community about how 
to handle such highly skewed, left-censored data, 
particularly where the proportion of ‘non-detects’ 
becomes substantial.10 11 However, substituting half 
the LOD for undetectable values is likely to result 
in positively biased estimates of average exposure.
Providing policy-makers and other stakeholders 
with reliable and understandable information 
on exposure is key to ensuring that appropriate 
measures are taken to protect populations from the 
harms caused by SHS. There is a need to under-
stand how population exposure to SHS has changed 
over time in countries that are attempting to enter 
an ‘endgame’ phase for tobacco use. This paper 
describes analysis of salivary cotinine data from 
subsamples of the non-smoking adults collected in 
the Scottish Health Survey since 1998 (the 1995 
survey collected serum cotinine). The analysis seeks 
to present two useful metrics of population expo-
sure: the proportion of non-smokers with non-mea-
surable cotinine and calculation of the population 
GM based on a statistical methodology that takes 
account of undetectable cotinine levels.
MeThODs
Scottish Health Survey data from 1998 to 2016 
were acquired from the UK Data Service.12 The 
Scottish Health Survey is designed as a nationally 
representative sample of the population living in 
households in Scotland—full details of sample 
selection and data collection methods are avail-
able in each annual report. Data were restricted to 
those who were aged 16 or above and had a valid 
cotinine sample with a measure below 12 
ng/mL, 
the cut-point for validated non-smoking adults 
(n=13 
563; ranging from 630 non-smoking adults 
in 2015 to 3738 in 1998).13 The proportion of 
valid samples that was below 0.1

for salivary cotinine, was calculated for each time point. Tobit 
regression of log-transformed concentrations with the LOD 
as the lower limit was used to determine the GMand 95% CI 
estimates. This method is recommended for use in datasets 
containing values below detection14 and has been used in other 
research on tobacco smoking.15 Data were extracted from the 
original SPSS V
.19.0 files downloaded from the UK Data Service 
website and analysis was performed in Microsoft Excel and Stata 
V
.13.1 (Stata Corporation). Change was calculated for the whole 
period 1998–2016. The trend during the period (2008–2016) 
after smoke-free legislation was implemented in Scotland in 
2006 was assessed by fitting a linear best-fit line and determining 
the regression equation.
The method of sample collection has remained the same 
during the period reported here. The method of analysis of saliva 
samples used since the 2009 Scottish Health Survey is high-per-
formance liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spec-
trometry with multiple reaction monitoring (LC-MS), replacing 
the gas chromatography nitrogen phosphorous detection method 
used in the 1998, 2003 and 2008 surveys. The sample prepara-
tion prior to LC-MS was liquid/liquid extraction.16 The LOD 
has remained the same during the period reported in this paper.
resulTs
Figure 1 provides details of the salivary cotinine data for 
non-smoking adults in Scotland from the Scottish Health Surveys 
between 1998 and 2016. The percentage of non-smoking adults 
who had no detectable cotinine in their saliva increased from 
12.5% (95% CI 11.5% to 13.6%) in 1998 to 81.6% (95% CI 
78.6% to 84.6%) in 2016. This represents a more than sixfold 
increase in the proportion of non-smokers being protected from 
the harms associated with exposure to SHS. The population 
exposure expressed as a GM, determined from Tobit regres-
sion, also reduced substantially from 0.464 
ng/mL (95% 
CI 
0.444 to 0.486 
ng/mL) in 1998 to 0.013 
ng/mL (95% 
CI 0.009 
to 0.020 
ng/mL) in 2016: a reduction of 97.2%. Tobit regres-
sion-based estimates were lower by around 0.05 
ng/mL than 
those derived from the previous methodology in all the years 
following the introduction of smoke-free legislation in Scotland.
Most of this change occurred between 2003 and 2008 during 
the period when restrictions on smoking in enclosed public 
spaces, encompassing nearly all work and leisure settings, were 
introduced in Scotland in March 2006. When the analysis of 
change is restricted to data from the years 2008 to 2016 (after 
smoke-free legislation was implemented), the results show 
continued improvements in the proportion of adults without 
measurable cotinine (from 60.0% in 2008 to 81.6% in 2016) 
by 2.67% per annum (R2=0.85). Similarly, the GM of salivary 
cotinine concentrations reduced from 0.057 (95% CI 0.047 to 
0.070) to 0.013 (95% CI 0.009 to 0.020) 
ng/mL over 2008 to 
2016, respectively, by −0.006 
ng/mL per annum (R2=0.76).
DIsCussIOn AnD COnClusIOns
This paper highlights dramatic reductions in exposure of 
non-smoking adults to SHS in the Scottish population. National 
time-series data on population exposure to SHS are scarce,9 17 18 
but they can play a key role in helping us better understand 
the effects of tobacco policy interventions. Measures of central 
tendency such as the arithmetic mean, median and mode are 
not well suited to describing exposures in datasets where a 
considerable proportion of the values are below the LOD. The 
GM is commonly used to provide statistical information in these 
cases but as data with 0 values cannot be included, it is often 
necessary to substitute or impute values for samples that are 
<LOD. In the 2015 Scottish Health Survey,9 the GM salivary 
cotinine was reported as 0.09 
ng/mL but this value was based 
on over three-quarters of the sample providing saliva with 
cotinine <LOD, and thus being assigned a value of 0.05 
ng/
mL, on the basis of it being halfway between 0 and the LOD 
of 0.1 
ng/mL in accordance with traditional practice. The use

Brief report
of Tobit Regression imputation methods described here could 
be further developed to take account of other exposure predic-
tors such as living with a smoker, occupational exposure, type 
of home.
The two metrics presented here—the proportion of the 
non-smoking population that have measurable cotinine in their 
saliva and a valid measure of central tendency that takes account 
the increasing proportion of the population who have cotinine 
values below the level of detection—provide policy-makers with 
much clearer data. However, there is a high proportion of the 
cotinine samples below the LOD, and the estimated GM level is 
almost 1/10 of the LOD. Efforts should be made to improve the 
chemical analytical techniques to increase the reliability of the 
quantitative measures of changes in the population exposure to 
SHS.
In 1998, just over 1 in every 10 non-smoking adults presented 
with no biochemical evidence of exposure to SHS, by 2016 that 
had risen to more than 8 in every 10. Our results reflect similar 
findings from a large study in England on temporal changes in 
salivary cotinine levels in children: the proportion of children 
with no detectable cotinine rose from 14.3% in 1998 to 68.6% 
in 2012.17
Our data show that the proportion of non-smoking adults 
in Scotland with detectable cotinine has continued to fall for 
the past decade. Recent work on SHS in Scotland has focused 
almost exclusively on protecting children from SHS with a 
media campaign ‘Take It Right Outside’ running in 2014/2015, 
and a national target set to reduce children’s exposure to SHS 
launched by the Scottish Government.19 It is possible that this 
drive to change smoking behaviour in home settings has led to 
consequent reductions in the proportion of adult non-smokers 
with no measurable cotinine concentrations in 2016.
Objective measures of SHS exposure using biomarkers are 
important but not available in all countries. Other indicators of 
tobacco control progress can include assessment of compliance 
with smoke-free legislation and measurements of air concen-
trations in hospitality and other venues—a toolkit for use in 
low-income and middle-income countries has been published.20 
Markers such as the proportion of smoke-free homes tend to rely 
on self-report, and these can be influenced by attitudes and social 
norms. The Scottish Health Survey for 2012–2016 gathered 
self-report data from non-smoking adults about their perceived 
exposure to SHS in their own or other people’s homes, at work, 
outside buildings, in cars/vans 
and in other public places. In each 
of the 2012, 2013 and 2014 surveys, 70% of non-smokers said 
they had not been exposed to smoke in any of these places; rising 
to 74% in 2015 and was 73% in 2016.21 It is encouraging that 
these figures are broadly similar to the data presented here in 
terms of the proportion of non-smoking adults with no measur-
able salivary cotinine.
Our study did not analyse the sociodemographic patterning 
of salivary cotinine concentrations, but it is worth noting that 
the 2016 Scottish Health Survey reports a gradient in terms 
of self-reported exposure to SHS where 75% of non-smoking 
adults living in the 20% most affluent areas reported no expo-
sure to SHS compared with just 64% of those living in the 20% 
most deprived homes.21
While observing the improvements achieved in Scotland and 
elsewhere,17 18 22 it is important to note that the most recent results 
here indicate that nearly one-fifth of the non-smoking adult popu-
lation in Scotland is exposed to SHS on any given day. The situation 
is likely to be similar in many countries where smoke-free measures 
are well developed and while much of this exposure takes place in 
home settings there is still considerable evidence that non-smokers 
are exposed in the workplace, cars and peripheral settings such 
as building entrances and outdoor areas of bars.21 Recent work 
has shown that those employed in the prison sector continue to 
be occupationally exposed to SHS23 as are health and community 
care workers who enter smokers’ homes to provide care.24 The 
‘SHS issue’ is not yet ‘solved’: the public health community needs 
to continue their efforts and consider further measures to protect 
non-smokers from SHS. The use of objective measurements, such 
as salivary cotinine and appropriate targets for policy-makers 
should be encouraged as a route to develop interventions and 
tobacco control measures relating to SHS.
What this paper adds
 
► Exposure to secondhand smoke (SHS) evidenced by salivary 
cotinine in non-smoking adults in Scotland has fallen 
dramatically in the past two decades.
 
► Reductions in population exposure to SHS continued after 
introduction of smoke-free laws in 2006.
 
► The proportion of non-smoking adults with salivary cotinine 
at concentrations <0.1 ng/mL provides a useful indicator 
of national progress towards article 8 of WHO Framework 
Convention on Tobacco Control.
