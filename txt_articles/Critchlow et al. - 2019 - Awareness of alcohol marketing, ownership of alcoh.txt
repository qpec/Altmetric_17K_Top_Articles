Objectives To explore awareness of alcohol marketing 
and ownership of alcohol branded merchandise in 
adolescents and young adults in the UK, what factors 
are associated with awareness and ownership, and what 
association awareness and ownership have with alcohol 
consumption, higher-risk drinking and susceptibility.
Design Online cross-sectional survey conducted during 
April–May 2017.
setting The UK.
Participants Adolescents and young adults aged 11–19 
years in the UK (n=3399).
Main outcome measures Alcohol Use Disorders 
Identification Test–Consumption (AUDIT-C) (0–12) and 
indication of higher-risk consumption (>5 
AUDIT-C) in 
current drinkers. Susceptibility to drink (yes/no) in never 
drinkers.
results Eighty-two per cent of respondents were aware 
of at least one form of alcohol marketing in the past month 
and 17% owned branded merchandise. χ2 tests found 
that awareness of marketing and ownership of branded 
merchandise varied within drinking variables. For example, 
higher awareness of alcohol marketing was associated 
with being a current drinker (χ2=114.04, p<0.001), higher-
risk drinking (χ2=85.84, p<0.001), and perceived parental 
(χ2=63.06, p<0.001) and peer approval of consumption 
(χ2=73.08, p<0.001). Among current drinkers, multivariate 
regressions (controlling for demographics and covariates) 
found that marketing awareness and owning branded 
merchandise was positively associated with AUDIT-C 
score and higher-risk consumption. For example, current 
drinkers reporting medium marketing awareness were 
twice as likely to be higher-risk drinkers as those reporting 
low awareness (adjusted OR (AOR)=2.18, 95% CI 1.39 to 
3.42, p<0.001). Among never drinkers, respondents who 
owned branded merchandise were twice as likely to be 
susceptible to drinking as those who did not (AOR=1.98, 
95% CI 1.20 to 3.24, p<0.01).
Conclusions Young people, above and below the legal 
purchasing age, are aware of a range of alcohol marketing 
and almost one in five own alcohol branded merchandise. 
In current drinkers, alcohol marketing awareness was 
associated with increased consumption and greater 
likelihood of higher-risk consumption. In never drinkers, 
ownership of branded merchandise was associated with 
susceptibility.
strengths and limitations of this study
 
► This is the first study to examine awareness of al-
cohol marketing and ownership of alcohol branded 
merchandise in a demographically representative 
sample of young people across the UK, including 
those above and below the legal purchasing age for 
alcohol.
 
► The study provides timely insight into what forms 
of alcohol marketing young people are aware of, 
how frequently they recall seeing alcohol marketing, 
and what factors are associated with higher aware-
ness of alcohol marketing and ownership of alcohol 
branded merchandise.
 
► The large sample size supports robust statistical 
analysis to examine the relationship (if any) between 
alcohol marketing and consumption, controlling 
for demography and relevant covariates (eg, peer 
consumption).
 
► The study explores the association between alcohol 
marketing and consumption at three levels: overall 
alcohol consumption, higher-risk drinking in current 
drinkers and susceptibility in never drinkers.
 
► The cross-sectional nature of the survey does not 
enable causal relationships to be drawn about the 
link between alcohol marketing and either con-
sumption or susceptibility.

IntrODuCtIOn
Adolescents and young adults (hereafter ‘young people’, 
aged 11–19 years) are a focal population for alcohol 
research because consumption at this stage of develop-
ment is associated with increased drinking and risk of 
concomitant harms in later adulthood.1 2 Global estimates 
indicate that consumption by young people is particularly 
high in Europe, where the proportion of current drinkers 
(69.5%) is higher than the five other global regions, and 
the proportion of lifetime abstainers is lower (15.9%).3 
In England, it is estimated that approximately half of 
children aged 11–15 years (44%) have consumed an alco-
holic drink, 1 in 10 have consumed in the past week and 
9% have been drunk in the past month.4 Similar estimates 
are reported in Scotland and Wales.5 6 Understanding 
the drivers of alcohol consumption in young people is 
important given the immediate and long-term individual, 
social and economic consequences associated with high-
er-risk drinking.7 
One factor routinely cited as shaping alcohol-re-
lated attitudes and behaviours in young people is 
marketing.8 9 Marketing is fundamentally important to 
alcohol producers. It represents the primary method of 
communicating with new and existing consumers, can 
directly encourage sales and can increase brand salience 
over competitors. Accordingly, alcohol companies have 
used highly visible marketing for over 100 years,10 with 
the current UK landscape characterised by a complex 
network of mass media marketing (eg, television), alter-
native marketing (eg, sponsorship), consumer marketing 
(eg, price) and stakeholder marketing (eg, to retailers).9 
The importance of marketing to the alcohol industry 
is evidenced through their annual investment, with 
Diageo’s global marketing expenditure approximately 
£1.8 billion.11 Continued consolidation in the alcohol 
industry has also seen the market become dominated 
by a small number of transnational producers, creating 
larger marketing budgets, economies of scale and intense 
competition.12
Content analysis research, which focuses on the 
marketing output as the unit of analysis, consistently 
reports that marketing may reach and influence young 
people. For example, marketing has been reported 
in media environments where young people may be 
exposed, including sports,13 social media,14 print media15 
and onscreen.16 17 Content research has also found that 
marketing may appeal to young people through creative 
designs, use of topical and real-world associations which 
may resonate with younger audiences, and by promoting 
positive connotations around consumption (eg, socia-
bility or desirable lifestyles).18 19 It has also been suggested 
that commercial marketing contains ambiguous messages 
about lower-risk consumption.20 21
Systematic reviews of consumer research, which focus 
on the individual as the unit of analysis, provide consis-
tent evidence that awareness of, and participation with, 
marketing has a causal influence on young people’s 
consumption, including initiation and frequency of 
drinking.22 23 Qualitative research has also suggested 
that this relationship is more complex than an ‘exposure 
equals consumption’ hypothesis, and that young people 
consider alcohol marketing and branding to hold rich 
cultural, social and symbolic meaning.14 24 25 Accordingly, 
message interpretation research has attempted to move 
the debate on from whether marketing is associated with 
consumption and onto how this influence occurs, by 
identifying psychological mechanisms which mediate the 
relationship between exposure and consumption.26 27
In the UK, the influence of alcohol marketing on young 
people has been a topic of debate for decades.9 28 These 
debates are further supplemented by concerns about the 
efficacy and effectiveness of self-regulation, the predom-
inant approach employed to control alcohol marketing 
in the UK. This includes suggestions that self-regula-
tion provides inadequate restrictions, is not consistently 
enforced or complied with, is retrospective and slow to 
react to complaints, lacks meaningful sanctions and lags 
behind modern marketing methods.9 28–32 There are, 
however, unresolved issues which have inhibited attempts 
to move the debate forward. In the UK, the last large-
scale assessment of young people’s awareness of alcohol 
marketing is a decade old, was only conducted in Scot-
land, only sampled adolescents under the minimum 
purchase age, only considered overall marketing aware-
ness (not frequency) and did not consider higher-risk 
consumption.33 34
In this study, we explore frequency of awareness for 
alcohol marketing and ownership of alcohol branded 
merchandise in a demographically representative sample 
of young people in the UK, including those above and 
below the legal purchasing age. We also consider what 
association (if any) awareness of alcohol marketing and 
ownership of branded merchandise has with alcohol 
consumption and higher-risk drinking in current 
drinkers, and susceptibility to drink in never drinkers.
MethOD
Design and sample
Data come from the 2017 Youth Alcohol Policy Survey, 
an online cross-sectional survey conducted with young 
people aged 11–19 years in the UK (n=3399). Responses 
were collected during April–May 2017. The survey 
was hosted by YouGov, a market research company, 
that recruited a sample intended to be representative of 
the UK population from their UK panel.35 Participants 
aged 16 years or over were approached directly to partic-
ipate, while those aged under 16 years were approached 
through existing adult panel members known to have 
children. A survey weight was provided for each respon-
dent (based on age, gender, ethnicity, region and social 
grade) to enable descriptive data to be representative 
of the UK population. The study design was informed 
by previous cross-sectional surveys in the UK that have 
explored young people’s experiences of alcohol and 
tobacco marketing.33 36

Measures
Demography
Alcohol consumption is not homogeneous among young 
people in the UK.4–7 It is therefore important to adjust 
for demographic variation when examining any factors 
purported to be associated with consumption. In this 
study, age, gender, ethnicity, resident country (England, 
Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland), living status, employ-
ment status, educational status, legal purchasing status 
for alcohol (>18 years old) and indices of deprivation 
(IMD), were obtained from information held about panel 
respondents or survey questions.
Awareness of alcohol marketing
Awareness of alcohol marketing was assessed through 
structured, self-reported recall, a method frequently used 
in consumer research.33 Participants were prompted 
with the statement ‘Over the last month, how often, if at all, 
have you seen…’ and then presented with descriptions of 
nine examples of alcohol marketing: (1) Newspapers or 
magazines. (2) Television. (3) Billboards. (4) Radio. (5) 
Adverts on social media (eg, YouTube, Tumblr, Facebook, 
SnapChat, Instagram or other social media). (6) Famous 
people in films, music videos or TV or pictured in maga-
zines with alcohol (celebrity endorsement). (7) Sports, 
games or events sponsorship. (8) Special price offers. (9) 
Competitions or prize draws. As per recent research,37 38 
a Likert Scale was used to measure frequency of noticing 
marketing in the past month for each of the nine exam-
ples (1=everyday–6=not in the past month; not sure).
In the UK, survey research which has measured aware-
ness of alcohol marketing has typically used dichotomous 
response options for each channel (eg, yes/no) and 
used a summation across these to estimate overall aware-
ness.33 39 This method, however, only provides insight 
into the breadth of marketing awareness across channels, 
not frequency or volume, and therefore lacks sensitivity 
and may underestimate awareness. To enhance accuracy 
in this study, the self-reported frequency of awareness 
for each marketing example was converted into the esti-
mated number of days that marketing had been seen in 
a 4-week period (ie, ‘1 month’). This timeframe is consis-
tent with previous research40 41 and is representative of the 
minimum number of days in any month. For example, an 
answer of ‘everyday’ equated to 28 instances of awareness 
over 4 weeks (ie, 7 days per week multiplied by 4) and once 
to twice per week equated to six instances over 4 weeks 
(ie, 1.5 times per week multiplied by 4) (see table 1 for 
other response options). Scores across the nine channels 
were summed to create an aggregate score, providing an 
approximation of total alcohol marketing awareness in 
the past month. Estimating total volume of awareness, 
as opposed to breadth across channels, is consistent with 
other recent alcohol marketing research.42 43
In this study, an aggregate awareness score was only 
computed when a valid answer had been given for all

nine marketing examples. To provide meaningful inter-
pretative utility, the aggregate score for the valid sample 
was split into tertiles of low (aggregate score <16; aware-
ness approximately every other day), medium (17–53; 
awareness approximately daily) and high awareness (>54; 
awareness almost twice daily). If a participant answered 
‘not sure’ to any of the nine channels they were coded as 
‘not stated’ for the aggregate score. Indicating ‘not sure’ 
meant that a respondent’s potential aggregate score was, 
by default, more conservative than those who provided 
a valid answer to all nine examples. These respondents 
were therefore coded as a separate ‘not sure’ category 
to avoid biasing the proportion of valid respondents 
considered to have low or medium awareness, or what the 
tertiles boundaries were.
Ownership of alcohol brand merchandise
Ownership of alcohol branded merchandise was 
measured through a single item adapted from previous 
research.33 44 Participants were asked ‘Do you own any 
merchandise (such as clothing or drinks glasses) that show an 
alcoholic drink brand or logo?’ (yes/no/not sure).
Alcohol consumption status
Participants were asked ‘Have you ever had a whole alcoholic 
drink? Not just a sip?’.33 34 Those who answered ‘No’ were 
classed as never drinkers while those who answered ‘Yes’ 
were classed as ever drinkers.
Alcohol consumption and higher-risk drinking
Alcohol use was measured through the Alcohol Use 
Disorders Identification Test–Consumption (AUDIT-
C), which assessed frequency of consumption, units 
drunk in a typical drinking occasion and frequency of 
heavy episodic drinking. Responses were provided on 
5-point scales, with the answers for each item relative to 
frequency (0=never– 4=four times or more a week), units 
drunk (0=1–2 units–4=10 units or more) or frequency 
of heavy episodic drinking (0=never–4=daily or almost 
daily). Heavy episodic drinking was classified as eight 
or more units in a single occasion for males, and six or 
more units for females (1 unit=8 g or 10 mL of alcohol). 
A diagram depicting the unit content of alcoholic 
drinks was included to assist calculation of units. Those 
who answered anything other than ‘never’ on the first 
AUDIT-C item were classed as current drinkers and asked 
to complete the final two items. All other respondents (ie, 
those stating ‘never’ for frequency of consumption) were 
classified as non-drinkers and were not asked to complete 
the final two items. In current drinkers, a total AUDIT-C 
score was computed by summing the three AUDIT-C 
items (0–12), with a cut-off of >5 used to identify high-
er-risk consumption.45
susceptibility
As per tobacco research, susceptibility was defined as the 
absence of a firm decision not to drink alcohol in the next 
year.36 Never drinkers were classified as ‘non-susceptible’ 
if they answered ‘definitely no’ to the question ‘Do you 
think you will drink alcohol at any time during the next year?’. 
Those who answered anything other than ‘Definitely no’ 
were classified as susceptible.
Confounding variables
Confounding factors, reported to influence consumption 
in young people and used in previous alcohol marketing 
research, were included as covariates to contextualise any 
association between marketing and consumption.33 34 46 47 
Frequency of consumption was measured for the mother 
(female carer), father (male carer) and closest friend 
(each scored: 1=never–9=every day or almost every day; 
prefer not to say; not applicable). For all three groups, 
consumption was collapsed into five categories (never, 
less than monthly, monthly or fortnightly, at least weekly 
and not stated). Perceived acceptability of consump-
tion was measured for parents and peers (each scored: 
1=totally acceptable–5=totally unacceptable). For both 
groups, acceptability was converted into dichotomous 
categories (‘Neutral or unacceptable’ and ‘Acceptable’). 
For ever drinkers, age of first drink was also measured 
(<8 years old–19 years old; can’t remember; prefer not to 
say). Answers were converted into three categories (<13 
years; 14–15 years; >16 years).
ethics
YouGov included a lead for ethical and quality assur-
ance, including consent, postsurvey debriefing and sign-
posting to support organisations, and confidentiality and 
anonymity.
Patient and public involvement
The survey was developed following cognitive testing with 
a small sample (n=100) of young people to ensure age and 
cultural comprehension of the questions. Beyond this, no 
other patient or public involvement was undertaken.
Analysis
Data were analysed using SPSS V.23 (SPSS, Chicago, 
Illinois, USA). Descriptive data were weighted so that 
percentages and median scores were representative of 
the demographic profile of the UK population. Bivariate 
analyses, using χ2 tests, examined differences in level of 
alcohol marketing awareness and ownership of branded 
merchandise between the demographic and confounding 
variables.
A multivariate linear regression was conducted with 
current drinkers’ AUDIT-C score as the dependent vari-
able (0–12) and awareness of marketing and ownership 
of branded merchandise as the key independent vari-
ables. The following demographic and confounding vari-
ables were also included in initial blocks: age; gender; 
ethnicity; IMD quintile; resident country; educational 
status; working status; living status; frequency of mother 
(female carer), father (male carer) and close friend 
drinking; perceived parental and peer acceptability of 
consumption; and age at first drink. Categorical variables 
with at least three categories were converted into dummy 
(binary) variables to aid interpretation and comparison.

The omitted dummy variable formed the reference cate-
gory. For example, marketing awareness was a categor-
ical variable with four levels: low, medium, high and not 
stated. Four binary variables were computed: low aware-
ness, medium awareness, high awareness and not stated 
(each coded yes=1, no=0). By including medium, high 
and not stated in the multivariate analysis, and omitting 
low awareness, the reference category was low awareness. 
The multivariate regressions therefore demonstrate the 
extent to which medium or high marketing awareness, 
relative to low awareness, was associated with alcohol 
consumption. Reference categories for each variable are 
displayed in the results.
Two multivariate logistic regressions were conducted 
with higher-risk drinking (AUDIT-C >5) among current 
drinkers and susceptibility to drink among never drinkers 
as the dependent variables. Marketing awareness and 
ownership of branded merchandise were the key inde-
pendent variables. Where applicable, both logistic 
regressions controlled for the same demographic and 
confounding variables as the linear regression. Reference 
categories for categorical independent variables are indi-
cated in the results. For categorical variables which had 
three or more levels, and were of an ordinal level, the 
SPSS contrast=difference function enabled comparison 
of each increasing category level relative to the combined 
previous category levels. For example, the first compar-
ison with frequency of mother’s drinking and higher-risk 
drinking was ‘less than monthly drinking’ versus ‘mother 
never drinks’, whereas the final comparison was ‘at least 
weekly drinking’ versus ‘less often’. As the independent 
variables were categorical, ‘not stated’ responses were also 
included as a separate category and compared against the 
reference category for each variable. This enabled the 
maximum sample to be retained. For example, the large 
number of ‘not stated’ responses on level of marketing 
awareness could be compared with those for whom 
marketing awareness could be computed.
All multivariate analyses were conducted on unweighted 
data as the factors used to construct the weights were 
included as covariates in the models. The multivariate 
analyses were repeated on weighted data to check for 
consistency. As results for the key independent vari-
ables (marketing awareness and ownership of branded 
merchandise) were consistent, only the unweighted 
results are presented.

sample characteristics
The weighted sample (n=3399) had an average age of 
15.18 years (SD=2.55; range: 11–19 years), with three 
quarters (76%) below the legal purchasing age (<18 
years). There was an even distribution for gender (51% 
male and 49% female). The majority of the sample 
was white British (76%) and was evenly distributed across 
IMD (20% in each quintile). Most participants lived in 
England (84%) with the remainder from Scotland (8%), 
Wales (5%) and Northern Ireland (3%). Almost all 
participants were living at home with parent(s) or other 
adult family members (90%) and were in some form of 
education (95%).
Alcohol consumption and susceptibility
After excluding cases with missing data on drinking status 
(n=62, weighted), almost half of the weighted sample 
(48%; n=1590) were current drinkers. Within current 
drinkers, the average AUDIT-C score was 4.33 (SD=2.77). 
Almost half of current drinkers (44%; n=707) were clas-
sified as higher-risk (>5 AUDIT-C). After excluding cases 
with missing data on drinking status (n=62, weighted), 
almost half of the weighted sample (49%; n=1623) 
was never drinkers. Within never drinkers, half were clas-
sified as susceptible (52%; n=841).
Awareness of alcohol marketing
The most frequent sources of marketing awareness in 
the past month were adverts on television (median=6 
instances per month, IQR=14), celebrity endorsement 
(median=6, IQR=14) and special offers (median=6, 
IQR=14) (table 1). More than a third of respondents 
(range: 39%–43%) had noticed marketing through these 
channels at least weekly. Billboard adverts (median=2 
instances per month, IQR=6), sponsorship (median=2, 
IQR=6) and social media adverts (median=2, IQR=6) 
were noticed less than once a week, with at least a quarter 
of participants (range: 27%–31%) having noticed these 
at least weekly. Lowest awareness was for adverts in the 
print press (median=0 instances per month, IQR=6), on 
radio (median=0, IQR=0) and competitions (median=0, 
IQR=2). For each marketing example, a fifth or more 
(range: 19%–29%) were not sure how often, if at all, they 
had come across alcohol marketing. Overall, 82% had 
noticed marketing through at least one channel.
Aggregate alcohol marketing awareness
The median aggregate alcohol marketing awareness 
score was 32 (IQR=60), equating to noticing 32 instances 
of alcohol marketing in the past month (under minimum 
purchase age: median=28; IQR=60). When categorised 
into tertiles, 35% of the valid sample was classified as 
having low awareness (<16 instances per month), 32% 
had medium awareness (17–53) and 34% had high aware-
ness (>54). In those under the minimum purchase age, 
38% had low awareness, 31% medium and 32% high.
Bivariate χ2  tests found that higher awareness of 
alcohol marketing was significantly associated with being 
male, of legal purchasing age, a current drinker, a high-
er-risk drinker, not in education, in employment, and 
perceiving that parents and peers would consider it okay

Owning alcohol branded merchandise
Almost a fifth of participants (17%) reported owning 
alcohol branded merchandise. Bivariate χ2 tests found 
that ownership of branded merchandise was significantly 
associated with being of white British ethnicity, of legal 
purchase age, a current drinker, a higher-risk drinker, 
not in education, in employment, and perceiving that 
parents and peers would consider it okay to consume 
(table 3). Ownership of branded merchandise was

also associated with greater frequency of mother 
(female carer) consumption, χ2(8)=44.11, p<0.001, 
greater frequency of father (male carer) consumption, 
χ2(8)=56.49, p<0.001, and greater frequency of close 
friends drinking, χ2(8)=178.76, p<0.001. There was also 
an overall effect of IMD, χ2(4)=15.73, p<0.01, although 
this had no distinct pattern across escalating depriva-
tion. There was no difference by resident country or 
gender.
Association between alcohol marketing and AuDIt-C scoring
A multivariate linear regression examined the asso-
ciation between marketing awareness, ownership of 
branded merchandise and AUDIT-C scoring in current 
drinkers (table 4). After controlling for demographic and 
confounding factors, medium alcohol marketing aware-
ness (b=0.79, 95% CI 0.37 to 1.21, p<0.001), or high aware-
ness (b=0.85, 95% CI 0.44 to 1.26, p<0.001), compared 
with low awareness, was associated with higher AUDIT-C 
score, as was ownership of branded merchandise (b=0.79, 
95% CI 0.55 to 1.04, p<0.001). Of the demographic vari-
ables, being older (p<0.001), male (p=0.01), from a 
more affluent IMD (p<0.01), in education (p<0.01) and 
living independently of parents or adult family members 
(p<0.001) was also associated with higher AUDIT-C score 
in the final model. Of the confounding variables, having 
a close friend who drinks at least weekly (p<0.001), and 
perceiving that parents consider it acceptable to consume 
(p<0.05) was also associated with higher AUDIT-C score. 
Having a first alcoholic drink at at least 16 years (p<0.001) 
was associated with lower AUDIT-C score, compared with 
those who first drank aged 14–15 years.
Association between alcohol marketing and higher-risk 
consumption
A multivariate logistic regression examined the associa-
tion between marketing awareness, ownership of branded 
merchandise and higher-risk drinking in current drinkers 
(table 5). After controlling for demographic and 
confounding factors, medium alcohol marketing aware-
ness (adjusted OR=2.18, 95% CI 1.39 to 3.42, p<0.001), 
high awareness (adjusted OR (AOR)=1.43, 95% CI 1.01 
to 2.02, p<0.05) and owning branded merchandise 
(AOR=1.71, 95% CI 1.31 to 2.22, p<0.001) were asso-
ciated with higher-risk drinking. Of the demographic 
variables, being older (p<0.001), male (p<0.05), from 
England compared with Wales (p<0.05), in education 
(p<0.05) and living independently (p<0.05) were asso-
ciated with higher-risk drinking in the final model. Of 
the confounding variables, increasing frequency of close 
friend consumption (p<0.001) and having had first drink 
at age 14–15 years or younger (p<0.001), was associated 
with higher-risk consumption.

branded merchandise and susceptibility to drink in 
never drinkers (table 6). After controlling for demo-
graphic and confounding variables, awareness of alcohol 
marketing was not associated with susceptibility, but 
ownership of branded merchandise was, with those who 
owned branded merchandise almost twice as likely to be 
susceptible compared with those who did not (AOR=1.98, 
95% CI 1.20 to 3.24, p<0.01). Of the demographic vari-
ables, only being white British (p<0.01) was associated with 
susceptibility in the final model. Of the confounding vari-
ables, frequency of mother (female carer) consumption 
(p<0.001), frequency of father (male carer) consump-
tion (p<0.05), frequency of close friend consumption 
(p<0.001) and perceived peer approval (p<0.001) were 
associated with susceptibility.

The findings indicate that young people in the UK are 
aware of a variety of alcohol marketing and almost a 
fifth own branded merchandise. The results also show

merchandise are associated with increased consumption 
and higher-risk drinking in current drinkers, and that 
ownership of branded merchandise is associated with 
susceptibility in never drinkers. We address key evidence 
gaps in the UK by exploring frequency of marketing 
awareness (not just breadth of exposure) and demon-
strating an association between marketing and both 
consumption and susceptibility in young people above 
and below the legal purchasing age from across the UK.
The findings are consistent with suggestions that 
alcohol marketing appears in contexts which may reach 
young people, including those under the legal purchasing 
age.8 9 Awareness included mass media marketing (eg, tele-
vision), alternative marketing (eg, sponsorship and celeb-
rity endorsement), consumer marketing (eg, price offers) 
and digital media. This highlights the dynamic nature of 
‘360-degree’ marketing strategies and how they reach 
young people in offline and online environments.9 48 The 
results extend understanding by showing how frequently 
young people see alcohol marketing; with at least 1 in 10 
reporting daily or almost daily awareness through three of 
the nine marketing examples. Approximately half of the 
sample had seen at least 32 instances of alcohol marketing 
per month, which equates to awareness at least once a day. 
Although there were expected differences in awareness 
between drinkers and never drinkers,33 49 there were no 
differences between key demographic groups, including 
ethnicity, indices of deprivation and resident country. 
This suggests that awareness of alcohol marketing occurs 
in young people across the UK, and is not isolated to a 
minority of demographic groups.
The results are consistent with longitudinal research 
which has shown a link between marketing and increased 
consumption in young people.22 23 34 38 Although 
marketing awareness did not have an association with 
susceptibility in never drinkers, ownership of branded

merchandise did. Research has reported that partici-
pation with marketing has a stronger association with 
consumption than awareness.33 34 39 49 Our findings there-
fore suggest that the effect of participation is pronounced 
in never drinkers. Nevertheless, as research suggests that 
not all alcohol marketing or brands are equally appealing 
to youth,25 50 it is possible that focusing on aggregated 
alcohol marketing awareness (the approach in this study) 
may have disguised associations between individual exam-
ples of marketing and susceptibility in never drinkers. The 
findings also extend understanding by showing an associ-
ation between marketing and consumption across young 
adulthood. This includes an association with suscepti-
bility and consumption in young people under the legal 
purchasing age and higher-risk drinking in newly legal 
drinkers. Newly legal drinkers are an important target 
for alcohol marketers18 and are a key under-researched 
group.51 The findings therefore highlight the importance 
of considering the wider role that marketing plays on 
consumption, not just in those under the purchasing age.
Except for the Scottish government’s decision to 
implement minimum unit pricing,52 there has been little 
recent change in UK’s self-regulatory and co-regulatory 
frameworks for alcohol marketing.53 54 It is claimed that 
such self-regulatory approaches provide inadequate 
restrictions, are not suitably enforced, are retrospec-
tive and slow to react to complaints, and lack mean-
ingful sanctions.9 28–32 Although statutory regulations 
are cited as an alternative approach,28 studies have also 
questioned whether current examples, such as the Loi 
Évin in France, are being enforced properly or whether 
they reduce marketing exposure.13 37 Further research 
exploring the perspectives of stakeholders involved in 
the production, research, consumption and regulation 
of marketing would be of value to identify feasible and 
effective options to reduce youth exposure and form a 
consensus on appropriate action.55 56
There are limitations. First, the cross-sectional design 
cannot identify a causal relationship between marketing 
and consumption, although a directional effect is 
supported by longitudinal research.22 23 Moreover, that 
marketing had any association with consumption and 
susceptibility at all suggests that it must at least play 
either an initiating or reinforcing role. Second, the 
results are only partially representative of young adults 
above the legal purchasing age, although other research 
has shown similar trends in older young adults.39 Third, 
the marketing channels measured are not exhaustive 
and, consequently, the results may underestimate aware-
ness. Examples of omitted marketing include packaging, 
cinema, product placement and a broader range of 
digital marketing.33 39 49 It was also not possible to deci-
pher whether ‘not sure’ responses indicated uncertainty 
over whether a participant had seen alcohol marketed at 
all through a channel or uncertainty on the frequency of 
awareness. This influenced the design of the regression 
models (to account for a ‘Not sure’ category). Third, 
except for owning branded merchandise, the study only 
measured awareness of marketing, but not participation. 
As participation is reported to have a stronger effect,34 49 
the results may underestimate the association between 
marketing and drinking outcomes. Finally, measurement 
of owning branded merchandise also only included two 
examples as prompts (clothing and drinks glasses). It is 
possible that different prompts may have altered recall, 
and that multiple items or a free-text response option 
would have provided greater clarity on merchandise 
owned.
COnClusIOn
This paper makes important contributions to under-
standing by exploring awareness of alcohol marketing 
and ownership of branded merchandise by young people 
from across the UK, three quarters of who were under 
the legal purchasing age. The results highlight that 
‘360-degree’ marketing strategies have created several 
avenues for young people to be exposed to, or involved 
with, alcohol marketing, and that this is associated with 
consumption and higher-risk drinking in current drinkers 
and susceptibility in never drinkers. Further scrutiny and 
examination of the UK’s self-regulatory approach and 
viable alternatives are needed to identify feasible, appro-
priate and effective means of reducing marketing expo-
sure in young people.
