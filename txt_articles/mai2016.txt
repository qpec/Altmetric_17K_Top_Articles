Study Design. Retrospective cohort study.
Objective. The aim of this study was to determine whether the
level of a cervical disc herniation (CDH) procedure will
uniquely impact performance-based outcomes in elite athletes of
the National Football League (NFL).
Summary of Background Data. Comparative assessments of
postsurgical outcomes in NFL athletes with CDH at different
levels are unknown. Further, the surgical decision-making for
these types of injuries in professional football athletes remains
controversial.
Methods. NFL players with a CDH injury at a definitive
cervical level were identified through a review of publicly
available archives. Injuries were divided into upper- (C2-C4) and
lower-level (C4-T1) CDH. The impact on player outcomes was
determined by comparing return to play statistics and calculating
a ‘‘Performance Score’’ for each player on the basis of pertinent
statistical data, both before and after surgery.
Results. A total of 40 NFL athletes met inclusion criteria. In the
upper-level group, 10 of 15 (66.6%) players successfully
returned to play an average of 44.6 games over 2.6 years. The
lower-level cohort had 18 of 25 (72%) players return to play
with an average of 44.1 games over 3.1 years. There was no
significant difference in the rate of return to play (P ¼ 0.71).
Postsurgical performance scores of the upper and lower-level
groups were 1.47 vs. 0.69 respectively, with no significant
difference between these groups (P ¼ 0.06). Adjacent segment
disease requiring reoperation occurred in 10% of anterior
cervical discectomy and fusion patients. In 50% of foraminot-
omy patients, a subsequent fusion was required.
Conclusion. A uniquely high percentage of upper-level disc
herniations develop in NFL athletes, and although CDH injuries
present career threatening implications, an upper-level CDH
does not preclude a player from successfully returning to play at
a competitive level. In fact, these athletes showed comparable
postsurgical performance to those athletes who underwent CDH
procedures at lower cervical levels.

ervical spine pathology is common among elite
athletes, especially in contact sports such as Amer-
ican football.1–6 In utilizing a National Football
League (NFL) surveillance injury database, Mall et al ident-
ified that of the 2208 spine or axial skeleton injuries
recorded from 2000 to 2010, 987 (44.7%) were cervical
spine injuries. Cervical disc herniation (CDH) accounted for
6% of these spinal injuries and was responsible for a median
of 69 days missed per incident.5 Although a history of
cervical spine pathology can negatively impact the prospec-
tive value of athletes, there was no significant difference in
total number of future games started or player performance
score.1 Furthermore, although a cervical disc herniation
injury may be viewed as career-threatening for players in
the NFL, up to 72% of players successfully return to play
after surgical treatment.7
The natural history and pathology of cervical disc her-
niations are well known in the general population; however,
this may differ in the elite athlete population. For example,

the most prevalent levels of disc pathology in the general
population are at the levels caudal to C3 to C4, diagnosed at
an average 48 years of age, and are rarely preceded by a
history of trauma.8,9 Conversely, NFL athletes are treated
for CDH at a much higher rate at the upper levels of the
cervical spine (C2-C3 and C3-C4), diagnosed at a younger
age, and associated with sports-related trauma 82% of the
time.10 Consequently, it is unclear how these unique types of
disc herniation will impact an elite athlete’s performance
and career length.
Adjacentsegment diseaseafter surgicaltreatment forCDH
has been well described not only in the general population,
but also in NFL athletes.11,12 This unfortunate complication
has led to retirement for a number of NFL players.1,11 Owing
to the potentially catastrophic risk from adjacent segment
disease in the upper cervical region, some authors have
recommended that an upper-level CDH (C2-C4) should
preclude a player from returning to a collision sport after
an anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF).13 The
prospect of an adjacent-level pathology after either a C2-C3
or C3-C4 ACDF could have a dramatic impact not only on a
player’s ability to return to the field, but also on his postretire-
ment quality of life. Despite these contentions, other treating
physicians choose to offer ACDF as treatment for these types
of CDH and allow participation in collision sports after
adequate radiographic fusion is obtained.6
The uncertainty in treatment protocol for CDH injuries
has caused athletes to receive conflicting information
regarding the prognosis and activity restrictions after sur-
gical treatment for a cervical disc herniation. Consequently,
team managers and coaches are often unsure of releasing
their players to full contact drills even after medical clear-
ance is given from the operating surgeon. This retrospective
study was conducted to determine the long-term prognosis
of CDH injuries when categorized by the level of injured
disc. Metrics utilized for comparison were return-to-play
rates, career length, and performance-based outcomes.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
NFL players treated surgically for the diagnosis of single-
level CDH between 1979 and 2013 were identified for this
study. Identification occurred through analysis of team
medical records, newspaper archives, team injury reports,
and press releases.14,15 Athletes on the active roster of an
NFL team with a reported ‘‘disc herniation’’ or ‘‘herniated
disc’’ in the neck or cervical spine were considered. Final
inclusion criteria required a confirmed cervical level of
injury, reported symptoms including upper extremity rad-
iculopathy, and surgical treatment corroborated by at least
two different independent sources. Players with unclear
level of pathology, a diagnosis of ‘‘bulging disc,’’ ‘‘protrud-
ing disc,’’ ‘‘neck strain,’’ ‘‘cervical strain,’’ ‘‘spinal cord
injury,’’ or ‘‘fracture’’, or those that had conflicting medical
reports were excluded from this study.
Operative treatment was classified either as an anterior
cervical discectomy and fusion or posterior foraminotomy.
Additional revisions, multilevel fusions, and/or treatment
for adjacent segment disease were also recorded. Data
including player position, date of injury, date of operation,
date of first game played postoperatively, NFL experience
before injury, and retirement date from the NFL were
collected for each player.
Regular season game statistics for NFL athletes who met
the inclusion criteria were compiled both before and after
the diagnosis of a CDH. Games played, games started,
seasons played, sacks, interceptions, yards gained, and
touchdowns were recorded on a pre-and a post-treatment
basis. Successful return to play was defined as being on the
active roster for at least one NFL regular season game after
treatment. Player performance was measured using a stand-
ardized, previously published scoring system based on per-
tinent achievements important to an individual player’s
position (Table 1).15
In dividing a player’s accumulated score by the number of
games played, the performance score for each player was
normalized. Using this scoring system we tracked the per-
formance score (PS) both before and after the diagnosis of
CDH. PS was tabulated for those players who successfully
returned to play in an NFL game excluding offensive line-
man, whose performance is not commonly assessed with
publicly available in-game statistics. As an additional
measure of on-field performance, the ratio of the number
of games started versus games played was calculated. Each
player served as his own control both before and after
surgical treatment of CDH.
All statistics were calculated using SPSS software version
22 (IBM corporation, Chicago, IL). A Fisher exact test was
used to analyze categorical data. The continuous variables
of each cohort were compared using a 2-tailed Student t test.
Statistical significance was accepted at P < 0.05.
RESULTS
A total of 53 NFL players who were treated operatively for a
CDH between 1979 and 2013 were identified. Forty of these
athletes met the inclusion criteria with an injury at a con-
firmed cervical intervertebral level. Reported levels of CDH
injury ranged from C2-C3 to C7-T1. A CDH injury at

C2-C3 and C3-C4 were classified as ‘‘upper-level’’ (n ¼ 15)
and a CDH injury at C4-C5, C5-C6, C6-C7, and C7-T1 was
considered ‘‘lower-level’’ (n ¼ 25). Thirty-four of these ath-
letes were initially treated with an anterior cervical discec-
tomy and fusion, whereas six underwent a posterior
foraminotomy. Injury frequency varied by position, but
of note, defensive backs (11) and linebackers (7) accounted
for 45% of the athletes with surgically treated cervical disc
herniations in this study (Table 2).
A relatively high rate of upper-level CDH (37.5%) was
observed in these high-collision NFL athletes in comparison to
their rare occurrences in the general populace. Nevertheless,
upper-levelCDHinjuriesproducedreturn-to-playratessimilar
to those of their lower-level counterparts (66.7% vs. 72.0%,
respectively, P¼ 0.73). Moreover, athletes had similar recov-
ery times (10.0 vs. 8.6 months, respectively, P¼ 0.52). Career
lengths after injury (2.6 vs. 3.1 years, respectively, P¼ 0.61),
average games played after injury (44.6 vs. 44.1, respectively,
P¼ 0.97), games started (33.5vs.26.3, respectively, P¼ 0.54),
and performance scores (1.47 vs. 0.69, respectively, P¼ 0.06)
all did not significantly differ between the upper and lower-
level CDH cohorts (Table 3).
In our patient cohort, the posterior foraminotomy tech-
nique was only employed in the lower-level CDH injuries,
whereas ACDFs were seen in both groups. Of those NFL
athletes who underwent posterior foraminotomy, five of six
(83.3%) of these players were able to return to play for an
average of 4.3 years (57.4 games). In the ACDF cohort, 23 of
34 (67.6%) players were able to return to play for an
average of 2.6 years (41.4 games).
Adjacent segment disease requiring a fusion procedure
after ACDF was diagnosed in four (10%) of the players in
this study: two defensive backs, one linebacker, and one
offensive lineman. Two cases occurred in the upper levels
and two cases in the lower cervical levels. All players retired
after the second procedure. There were no players who
developed adjacent-level problems after a foraminotomy.
However, three of the six players who underwent posterior
foraminotomy ultimately required an ACDF revision pro-
cedure after recurrence of symptoms at the level of the index
surgery. This occurred at an average of 14.3 months after
the initial foraminotomy. Following the surgical revision
and additional rehabilitation, two of the three players were
able to return to play.
DISCUSSION
Frequent exposures to high-velocity trauma and extreme
stresses on the cervical spine put NFL athletes at unique risks

compared to the general population.7,16 The lack of infor-
mation regarding this magnitude of repetitive head and neck
trauma has led to conflicting opinions regarding return-to-
play prognosis as well as the type of surgical treatment to
offer. One unique risk in these collision athletes is upper-
level (C2-C3 and C3-C4) disc herniations. Although
typically rare in age-matched individuals of the general
population, the current body of literature suggests that this
level of pathology is much more prevalent in elite contact
athletes.5,8–10
Although physicians continue to treat upper-level CDH
injuries with higher restraint, data in this study show that
both upper and lower-level injuries have comparable post-
operative return to play rates, career lengths, and per-
formance. The success of these NFL players to return to
play after a surgery without subsequent neurologic injury
in this cohort supports those practitioners who clear their
patients back to full contact after successful surgery
and rehabilitation.
In this patient cohort, the well-known complication of
adjacent segment disease after ACDF has precluded some
surgeons from clearing NFL athletes after a successful
surgery. However, in our study, post-ACDF adjacent seg-
ment disease occurred in only 10% of players, and although
this ultimately resulted in these player’s retirement from
sport, its incidence was comparable to that of the general
population as reported by Hilibrand et al.12
Although foraminotomy patients did not develop adja-
cent segment disease, three of six players eventually required
a fusion after failing to achieve clinical success from the
index procedure. Although the sample size prevented us
from making definitive conclusions, it is possible that the
rigors and activity required by a professional athlete make
them poor candidates for a nonfusion procedure. Addition-
ally, the anterior implant spacer utilized in an ACDF pro-
cedure may also provide decompression of the nerves in a
more long-term capacity.
The methodologyemployedin this study, like other similar
publications of this type, has inherent limitations such as
possible reporting errors by our sources, misdiagnoses, selec-
tion bias toward more prominent athletes, and lack of access
to radiographic data.1,14,15 Given that our strict inclusion
criteria required the confirmation of the level of surgery from
2 different sources, the argument could be made that the
players in our study were more ‘‘high profile’’ than the
journeyman NFL athlete. However, compared to a recent
study that utilized the official NFL Injury Surveillance System
(NFL ISS), our study sample proved to be representative.10 Of
the 61 players identified in the NFL ISS as having cervical disc
herniations, our database was able to account for 53 players
(87%) during this time period. Unfortunately, only 40 of
these players had a reported level of injury and met inclusion
criteria. Although use of a league-wide medical database is
useful in reporting characteristics of injury including draft
status, recovery time, and position-specific considerations,
because this is an anonymized compilation, it cannot be used
to track outcomes after surgery. Our methods, although
limited by the sources of injury reports, remain the best
way to follow performance-based outcomes after treatment.
As our understanding of how the general population
differs from elite athletes in the natural history of cervical
spine pathology increases, treatment algorithms can be
tailored to better fit the needs of our patients. This study
builds on the body of evidence that elite athletes of collision
sports may have a different pathologic mechanism that
causes cervical disc herniations. Further study is required
to help surgeons definitively determine the individualized
course of treatment for an NFL player dependent on path-
ology, position, and patient wishes.
Key Points
The incidence of CDH injuries in NFL athletes is
different in demographics, mechanism, and
anatomic distribution to that of the general populace.
Athletes who are subject to collision forces are
uniquely prone to developing cervical disc
herniations at upper levels such as C2-C3 and
C3-C4.
NFL players who require surgical treatment for
upper-level CDH have postsurgical outcomes
similar to lower-level injuries.
Adjacent segment degeneration occurred in 10%
of the identified players in the ACDF cohort, a
rate comparable to the general populace.
Although further study with larger sample sizes is
needed, the 50% reoperation rate in the
foraminotomy sample was unexpectedly high.
