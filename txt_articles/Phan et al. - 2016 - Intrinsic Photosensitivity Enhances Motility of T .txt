Motility of T Lymphocytes

Sunlight has important biological effects in human skin. Ultraviolet (UV) light striking the epidermis 
catalyzes the synthesis of Vitamin D and triggers melanin production. Although a causative element in 
skin cancers, sunlight is also associated with positive health outcomes including reduced incidences of 
autoimmune diseases and cancers. The mechanisms, however, by which light affects immune function 
remain unclear. Here we describe direct photon sensing in human and mouse T lymphocytes, a cell-
type highly abundant in skin. Blue light irradiation at low doses (<300 mJ cm−2) triggers synthesis of 
hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in T cells revealed by the genetically encoded reporter HyPerRed. In turn, 
H2O2 activates a Src kinase/phospholipase C-γ1 (PLC-γ1) signaling pathway and Ca2+ mobilization. 
Pharmacologic inhibition or genetic disruption of Lck kinase, PLC-γ1 or the T cell receptor complex 
inhibits light-evoked Ca2+ transients. Notably, both light and H2O2 enhance T-cell motility in a Lck-
dependent manner. Thus, T lymphocytes possess intrinsic photosensitivity and this property may 
enhance their motility in skin.
Organisms have evolved a multitude of photoreceptors tuned to different light frequencies and coupled to diverse 
cellular responses. Plants, algae, bacteria and protozoa express red, blue/green and UV-light receptors that medi-
ate photosynthesis, phototropism and phototaxis1. In addition to specialized eyes, fish, amphibians and reptiles 
use photoreceptors in the pineal organ and skin to regulate melatonin synthesis and pigmentation respectively2,3. 
Until recently, photoreception in mammals was believed to be restricted to the eye. Only rods and cone cells in 
the retina (mediating the visual pathway) and a sub-population of retinal ganglion neurons (mediating circadian 
sensory input and pupillary constriction) were thought to contain true photoreceptors2,3. Human skin is nonethe-
less a major target for sunlight. UV light striking the superficial, epidermal layer triggers several well-described 
phototoxic and photochemical reactions, including the synthesis of Vitamin D and melanin2. Interestingly, func-
tional rhodopsin-containing photoreceptors have been identified in human melanocytes4 and keratinocytes5 and 
may contribute to UV phototransduction. Less energetic, visible radiation (400–750 nm) penetrates much deeper 
into the dermis than UV light with an e-fold reduction in intensity only every ~1 mm6. Some of this visible irra-
diation is reflected off blood vessels back through the skin, such that the total radiant flux near the skin surface 
is greater than the incident light6. Thus, compared with UV light, visible light can affect a much greater range of 
cells. Indeed, recent studies showed that red light stimulates the proliferation of keratinocytes7 and fibroblasts8 
while blue light alters skin cell differentiation9.
Sunlight also has a prominent effect on immune cells and immune function leading to beneficial effects on 
human health, including reduced incidence of autoimmune diseases10–12 and cancers13. The precise mechanisms 
by which sunlight affects immune function are unclear. Although, enhanced synthesis of Vitamin D is one pos-
sibility14,15, there is emerging evidence for Vitamin D-independent effects of sunlight16–18. Notably, normal skin 
contains a high density of T lymphocytes (~1 × 
 106 cells cm−2) performing immune surveillance, and the total 
number of T cells resident in skin is estimated to be double of that in circulation19. The effects of light on T cells, 
however, remain unexplored. In this study we report that T cells possess intrinsic sensitivity to blue and UV 
light. The detection of light is coupled to generation of H2O2 and activation of Src kinase and PLC-γ 
1 leading to 
elevated intracellular [Ca2+]. Photosensitivity is greater in activated T cells and enhances T-cell motility. Thus, T 
cells are a new type of photoreceptive cell and their photosensitivity may contribute to the effects of sunlight on 
immune function.

Results
Blue light increases [Ca2+] in T cells. 
We observed that blue-light irradiation of Jurkat T cells triggers an 
increase in intracellular [Ca2+] as measured by Fluo4 fluorescence (Fig. 1a and b, Supplementary Movies 1 and 2). 
 
The Ca2+ responses decreased after recovery in dark (20 min), after which cells could be re-stimulated by light 
(Fig. 1b and c). The responses were not due to photosensitization of Fluo4 since a blue-light pulse produced a 
similar effect when Ca2+ was measured using Rhodamine-2 with green light excitation (Fig. 1d). A cumulative 
activation plot shows that blue light (17 mW cm−2) increased [Ca2+] in ~90% of Jurkat T cells with a time for 
half-maximal activation (T1/2) of 38 seconds (Fig. 1e). We observed a similar response in human and murine 
CD3+ 
 T cells that had been previously activated by plate-bound anti-CD3 antibody or Concavalin A treatment 
(Fig. 1e). In contrast, un-stimulated T cells exhibited a greatly diminished light sensitivity. Further, light had no 
effect on murine, bone-marrow derived dendritic cells nor cultured sensory DRG neurons (Fig. 1e).

Irradiance and spectral dependence of T-cell photosignaling. 
Figure 2a–c show that the latency 
for light evoked responses depended on the irradiance. At low intensities (< 
6.5 mW cm−2 or 1.5 × 
 1016 pho-
tons s−1 cm−2) the T1/2 was directly proportional to the photon fluence rate (Fig. 2c). At higher irradiances the 
 
T1/2 approached saturation that may reflect a dead time in the signaling pathway. In contrast, Fig. 2d shows that the 
peak [Ca2+] of ~70% of a maximal ionomycin stimulus, was independent of the irradiance (1.2 to 18.8 mW cm−2). 
This peak response was comparable to, if not greater than, the Ca2+ rise evoked during TCR-mediated signaling 
(Supplementary Fig. 1). These data show that the light response depends on the total number of photons rather 
than irradiance flux or time and this observation supports the existence of a photon-counting mechanism.
Dose-response analysis for light-induced Ca2+ revealed half-maximal blue-light activation with 232 mJ cm−2 or 
5.6 ± 
 1.2 × 
 1017 photons cm−2 (Fig. 2e). To measure the spectral sensitivity for light signaling we irradiated T cells 
with light of varying wavelengths between 355 and 535 nm and constructed dose-response relationships for each 
wavelength as in Fig. 2e. Figure 2f shows a plot of EC50 versus wavelength (an action spectrum), and reveals peaks 
at ~355 nm and ~480 nm, with a sharp falloff at wavelengths greater than 510 nm. Thus, T cells exhibit discrete 
sensitivity to UV and visible-blue light, and their photosensitivity does not correlate with photon energy or heating. 
We also measured the T cell sensitivity to full-spectrum white light (400–700 nm). Figure 2g shows that visible radi-
ation activated Ca2+ levels with a half-maximal response at 6.7 ± 
 0.6 J cm−2. Importantly, these low doses of blue or 
full spectrum light were not toxic to T cells; we observed no changes in cell viability and murine splenocytes irradi-
ated (up to 5 J cm−2 white light) exhibited normal proliferation to plate bound anti-CD3ε (Supplementary Fig. 2).

Light generates Ca2+ signals via a Src kinase/PLC-γ1 pathway. 
Next, we tested a range of phar-
macologic inhibitors to explore how light sensing generated Ca2+ transients in T cells. Figure 3a shows that 
the broad-spectrum tyrosine kinase inhibitor, genestein, the Src tyrosine kinase inhibitor, PP2, a protein phos-
phatase CD45 inhibitor and the PLC inhibitor, U73122, all blocked light-evoked Ca2+-responses in Jurkat cells. 
During T cell receptor (TCR) signaling the Src kinases Lck and Fyn, phosphorylate several tyrosines in the CD3 
zeta chain leading to the recruitment and activation of the protein kinase, ZAP-7020. We found that blue-light 
dose-dependently stimulated phosphorylation of Lck, the dominant Src kinase in Jurkat cells21 (Fig. 3b and c, 
Supplementary Fig. 3). Levels of phospho-Lck increased beginning at 50 mJ cm−2 and peaked at 260 mJ cm−2 and 
this paralleled the light-dependent increase in [Ca2+] (see Fig. 2e). Induction of phospho-Lck was completely 
inhibited by PP2 indicating that light causes transphosphorylation of Lck (Fig. 3b). Similarly, blue light activated 
phospho-Src in primary CD3+ 
 T cells (Fig. 3d). Additionally, blue (Fig. 3e) or visible light (Supplementary Fig. 4) 
treatment of Jurkat cells stimulated phosphorylation of ZAP-70 in a Lck-dependent manner. PLC-γ 
1 associ-
ates with the TCR/CD3 complex and is phosphorylated downstream of activation of the Src20,22,23. Indeed, we 
found that light induced phosphorylation of PLC-γ 
1 at tyrosine 783 (Fig. 3f). To confirm a functional require-
ment for Lck and PLC-γ 
1 we measured light-evoked Ca2+ responses in Lck- and PLC-γ 
1-deficient Jurkat T cells 
(Fig. 3g and h). Light-induced Ca2+ increases were abolished in Lck-null cells and largely suppressed in PLC-γ 
1-deficient cells, a residual component may reflect expression of PLC-γ 
2 that can partly compensate for PLC-γ

124. In contrast, responses were fully restored in cells stably expressing PLC-γ 
1 (Fig. 3g and h). Further, genetic 
disruption of TCR expression attenuated the speed and magnitude of light-evoked Ca2+ signaling (Fig. 3g and i). 
These data indicate that light evoked Ca2+ responses in T cells require activation of Lck tyrosine kinase coupled to 
PLC-γ 
1 and an intact TCR complex facilitates this process. Finally, we examined the transport pathway underly-
ing the light-evoked Ca2+ response. Figure 3j shows that the Ca2+ rise persisted in a Ca2+-free medium indicating 
the mobilization of Ca2+ from internal stores. In addition, the duration of the Ca2+ rise was significantly greater 
in Ca2+-containing medium, suggesting a delayed component due to entry of extracellular Ca2+. Taken together, 
these data support the hypothesis that light stimulates a Src kinase/PLC-dependent pathway in T cells to mobilize 
Ca2+ and activate Ca2+ entry.
Light generates H2O2 in T cells. 
Mammals express two major classes of photoreceptors, opsins3 and cryp-
tochrome flavoproteins (CRY1 & CRY2)25,26. These proteins utilize retinal or flavin/pterin-based chromophores 
respectively, to capture photons at discrete wavelengths. We screened Jurkat T cells for expression of the identified 
mammalian opsin genes3 and detected transcripts for Opsin 3 (OPN3, Supplementary Fig. 5). Further, we detected 
expression of both CRY1 & 2 in Jurkat cells (Supplementary Fig. 6). However, disrupting expression of OPN3 or 
CRY1 & 2 did not affect light-evoked Ca2+ changes (Supplementary Figs 5 and 6). The action spectrum for T cells 
(Fig. 2f), containing peaks in the near-UV and blue wavelengths, is characteristic of riboflavin or a flavin-binding 
protein27. UV and very high-irradiance blue light (1–5 W; 22–40 J cm−2) can activate cellular flavin-binding oxi-
dases, leading to the formation of H2O2
28 and therefore we explored for a similar mechanism in T cells. We found 
that the antioxidants, ascorbic acid and docosahexaenoic acid, blocked light-evoked Ca2+ responses (Fig. 3a) sup-
porting a role for reactive oxygen species (ROS). However, light signaling persisted in the presence of the flavin 
oxidase inhibitor, diphenyliodonium, or mitochondrial electron transport chain inhibitors, antimycin and rote-
none (Fig. 3a), arguing against a role for flavoprotein enzymatic activity or mitochondrial respiration. To directly 
and selectively monitor H2O2 levels we transfected Jurkat cells with the genetically-encoded H2O2 reporter, 
HyPerRed29. We found that a low dose of blue light (300 mJ cm−2, 30 mW) was sufficient to trigger H2O2 produc-
tion in Jurkat cells (Fig. 4a). Subsequent stimulation of these light-sensitive cells with exogenous H202 (0.1–1 mM) 
produced little further increase in fluorescence, indicating that HyPerRed was almost completely oxidized by 
light-evoked signaling (Fig. 4a and b). Pretreating Jurkat cells with the anti-oxidants DHA and β 
-carotene 
(Fig. 4c) blocked the light-evoked increase in HyPerRed fluorescence. Flavins are well known to undergo pho-
toreduction accompanied by production of several forms of reactive oxygen species30. Notably reduced flavins 
can react with O2 to generate H2O2
31. To confirm this we measured production of H202 from irradiation of 
solutions containing riboflavin or flavin adenine dinucleotide (5 μ 
M). In both cases, blue-light (600 mJ cm−2) 
produced H202 that was inhibited by DHA and β 
-carotene (Supplementary Fig. 7). Taken together, our data sup-
port a mechanism by which irradiation of flavin/flavoproteins in T cells generates H202.
H2O2 can activate Src kinases directly by covalent modification of cysteines32,33 or indirectly by inhibiting 
CD45, and thereby promoting phosphorylation of Src at the positive regulatory site (Lck Y394)34,35. To confirm 
a direct action we transfected CHO and Hek-293 cells with Lck and measured phospho-Lck levels in response 
to blue light (500 mJ cm−2) or exogenous H2O2 (2 mM, 2 min). In both cell lines light failed to activate Lck, 
whereas H2O2 produced a robust increase in levels of phospho-Lck (Fig. 4d). In contrast, in Jurkat cells, both 
blue light and H2O2 strongly activated Lck and Zap-70 (Fig. 4e). Further, exogenous H2O2 (30–1000 μ 
M, 2 min) 
increased intracellular [Ca2+] in Jurkat cells, predominantly by increasing the number of responsive cells (Fig. 4f, 
Supplementary Fig. 8), and this effect was inhibited by PP2. These data show that H2O2 is sufficient to activate 
Lck and provide a causal nexus between blue light and activation of Ca2+ signaling. Figure 4g illustrates a putative 
signaling pathway with key pharmacologic and genetic interventions. In this model H2O2, generated by flavin 
photo-irradiation, activates Lck either directly and/or indirectly via CD45 to trigger signaling via Zap-70 and 
PLC-γ 
1. The precise role of CD45 is unclear since pharmacologic block of CD45 per se would also affect down-
stream Lck function by affecting the positive and/or negative regulatory sites Y394 and Y505 respectively34,35.
Light enhances T-cell motility. 
Next, we considered how photosensitivity might affect T-cell function. 
We observed that blue-light irradiation altered the morphology of T cells, inducing the extension of lamellipo-
dia (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Movies 2 and 3). Since motile lamellipodia are associated with cell migration36 
we measured effects of light on T-cell motility by tracking the movement of activated CD8+ 
 T cells across a 
fibronectin-coated surface. Figure 5a–c shows that low levels of blue light (120 mJ cm−2) increased random T-cell 
motility and the peak surface area (reflecting spreading lamellipodia), an effect that persisted following irradi-
ation. Thus, T cells exhibit photokinetic behavior. Next, we measured effects of light on chemotaxis. Figure 5d 
shows that irradiation with white light (1–5 J cm−2) enhanced migration of Jurkat T cells towards the T-cell 
chemokine, stromal-derived factor. Light increased chemotaxis in a dose-dependent manner with a peak 100% 
increase observed at irradiances greater than 2 J cm−2. In contrast, the same doses of light failed to stimulate 
chemotaxis in Lck-null Jurkat cells (Fig. 5d) confirming a requirement for Src kinase signaling. Next, we asked 
whether exogenous H202 could mimic the effects of light. Figure 5e shows that H202 dose-dependently increased 
chemotaxis in Jurkat cells with 100 μ 
M producing an effect equivalent to that of blue-light irradiation. Again, 
Lck-null cells were resistant to the actions of H202 and light (Fig. 5e). Finally, we found that treating wild-type 
Jurkat cells with abscorbic acid or PP2 blocked the stimulatory effects of blue light (600 mJ cm−2, Fig. 5f). Taken 
together, these data show that H202, acting via Lck, is both necessary and sufficient for light-evoked stimulation 
of T cell motility.

Discussion
Our data show that T cells possess the intrinsic capacity to sense and respond to light. We show that blue light 
triggers the production of H2O2 in T cells in vitro. In turn, light-evoked H2O2 leads to activation of Src, Zap-70, 
PLC-γ 
1 and intracellular [Ca2+] (see Fig. 4g) and these effects are accompanied by alterations in T cell motility. 
Importantly, these effects of light were reproduced by exogenous H2O2 and occurred in a Lck-dependent manner. 
Our experiments exclude photosensitization of dyes employed in some measurements. First, activation of Src and 
Zap-70 measured biochemically, as well as T cell migration occurred at similar light doses that produced Ca2+ 
responses. Second, the spectral sensitivity of T cells with peaks at both ~350 nm (UV) and ~470 nm (blue) does 
not match the absorption profile for Fluo4. Rather, this spectrum is consistent with involvement of flavin/flavo-
proteins. Flavins are abundant in mammalian cells with concentrations approaching 50 μ 
M measured in cardiac 
myocytes37, albeit much of this flavin is protein bound. Flavins are readily photoreduced leading to the generation 
of ROS including H2O2
30,31. Accordingly, we confirmed that blue light irradiation of flavin-containing solutions, 
at similar doses (600 mJ cm−2) used on T cells, produced H2O2 in vitro. There is also evidence in mammalian 
cells for high energy UV and blue light activating flavin oxidases and generating ROS28. Further, high frequency 
UV light (< 
280 nm) activates a mammalian “UV response” involving Src kinase and the c-jun and c-fos genes38, 
and this effect is blocked by the antioxidant N-acetyl cysteine. These light-evoked ROS signals are reported to 
emanate from peroxisomal28 or mitochondrial compartments39. It should be pointed out that sensitivity of T cells 
to light that we report here using low light (4–30 mW cm−2, 50–600 mJ cm−2) is much greater than these earlier 
reports employing very high irradiances and doses (1–3 W cm−2, 20–40 J cm−2). Further, light signaling in T

cells persisted in the presence of flavin oxidase or mitochondrial electron transport chain inhibitors ruling out 
enhanced flavin enzymatic activity or mitochondrial respiration as a source of H2O2.
Interestingly, we found that photosensitivity was greater in activated compared to naïve T cells. This might 
reflect clustering of TCR complexes in lipid micro domains that occurs in activated cells40. The TCR provides a 
scaffold for kinases and adaptor proteins including Src, Zap-70 and PLC-γ 
120,41, all of which we found are acti-
vated by blue light. Indeed, inhibiting TCR expression greatly attenuated light-evoked Ca2+ responses. Further, 
upon T cell activation flavoprotein rich mitochondria translocate toward the immune synapse42, potentially pro-
viding a greater source for light-evoked ROS. Finally, activation of T cells alters their antioxidant capacity; the 
membrane bound ROS scavenger, peroxiredoxin 1, is inhibited following TCR stimulation to permit microdo-
mains of elevated ROS43, and this may augment light-induced H2O2. This H2O2 can activate Src kinases either 
directly32,33 as we confirmed in cell lines, and/or indirectly, by inhibiting activity of the protein phosphatase 
CD4534, leading to enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation at the Src positive regulatory site, Y394. Interestingly, 
higher light doses attenuated the activation of Src and Zap-70 kinases and this may partly reflect ROS-mediated 
inactivation of Src44.
Importantly, we show that light potently affects T cell motility, stimulating random cell movement and chemo-
taxis. The effects on light on motility were maintained after irradiation and, since phototaxis requires a specialized 
apparatus to detect the directionality of light45, can be most parsimoniously explained as a photokinetic effect. 
Photokinesis is common in many eukaryotic microorganisms45, but to the best of our knowledge this constitutes 
the first report of photokinesis in a mammalian cell. We found that light-evoked chemotaxis required Lck (inter-
rogated both pharmacologically and genetically) and was replicated by exogenous H2O2. ROS signaling is known 
to affect motility in various cells46 although a role for ROS in T cell motility has not been previously established. 
Src kinases are also recognized regulators of leukocyte motility47, activating phosphoinositide 3 (PI3)-kinase γ 
and Rho GTPases, that in turn affect cell polarization, membrane protrusions, and motility. Thus, a light evoked 
H2O2/Src signaling pathway appears to underlie T cell photokinesis.

The identification of T cell photosensitivity has implications for both immunological research and immu-
nobiology. In the experimental setting, researchers exploiting light-based approaches, optogenetics for example, 
should consider the intrinsic actions of light on T cells. In the biological setting sunlight, particularly in the 
visible range, may impact the function of skin T cells. Although it needs to be confirmed in vivo, we propose 
that light may enhance the motility and migration of T cells through skin. Skin T cells comprise a population 
of memory cells performing immune surveillance (that can be activated in the skin by antigen-presenting cells) 
and others cell actively recruited by inflammation19. These cells may be exposed to considerable solar radiation. 
Bright sunlight has a peak irradiance of 120 mW cm−2 and approximately 40% of the energy is contained in the 
visible spectrum with a peak flux in the blue-green region (450–500 nm)6. Blue light can penetrate several millim-
eters through skin. Indeed, blue-light irradiation of mouse skin has been used to drive subcutaneous optogenetic 
implants48. Further, our observation that T cell photosensing involves an integration of the light signal (photon 
counting) indicates that photosignaling can proceed even with weak light levels given sufficient time.
In summary, our data show that T cells possess intrinsic sensitivity to blue light and that light operating via a 
H2O2 signaling pathway enhances T-cell motility.
Materials and Methods
All experimental procedures involving mice were approved by the Georgetown University Animal Care and Use 
Committee and conformed to National Institutes of Health guidelines.
Cell Culture. 
Jurkat, J.RT3-T3.5 (T cell receptor β 
 chain-deficient), J. Cam1.6 (Lck kinase deficient), 
J. gamma1 (PLC-γ 
1-null), J. gamma1WT (PLC-γ 
1 rescue) and D1.1 cell line cells (American Tissue Culture 
Collection), were cultured in RPMI medium 1640 (HyClone) supplemented with 2 mM L-glutamine, 50 μ 
M 
2-ME, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 10 mM HEPES, 1% penicillin and streptomycin, and 10% FBS (HyClone). Cells 
were maintained at density 0.5–1 × 
 106/ml. Mouse (C57/Bl6, Jackson Labs) T cells were purified from spleno-
cytes or lymph nodes using MagCellect Mouse CD3 T Cell Isolation kit (R&D Systems). Human lymphocytes 
were separated from whole blood (obtained from Research Blood Components, Brighton, MA, USA) with 
Lymphoprep (Axis-Shield) density gradient centrifugation and purified using Dynabeads Untouched Human 
T cell Kit (Invitrogen). Cells were cultured for 48 h in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with Il-2 10 ng/ml 
(Miltenyi Biotec) and ConA 5 μ 
g/ml (Sigma Aldrich). Il-2 and Con A were then removed for 18 h–48 h prior to 
experiments. In some experiments mouse cells were activated with plate bound anti-CD3 antibody (10 μ 
g/ml, 
 
145-2C11; Biolegend) and anti-CD28 (0.5 μ 
g/ml, 37.51; Biolegend) for 48 h, and rested overnight prior to exper-
iments. Naive CD3+ 
 T cells were isolated from mouse lymph nodes cultured for 12–48 hrs with a low concentra-
tion of IL-2 (2 ng/ml).
Irradiation and Ca2+ imaging. 
Cells were plated on glass coverslips in serum depleted (0.5% FBS) buffer 
in the dark for 90–120 minutes prior to imaging. The buffer contained in mM: 140 NaCl, 4 KCl, 10 HEPES, 10 
glucose, 1.2 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2 pH 7.3. Under these conditions cells loosely adhered to the coverslip. Cells were 
irradiated with an Argon laser (488 nm) on a Zeiss confocal microscope or via the epifluorescent port of a Nikon 
TE2000 microscope using the following excitation filters (nm): 355 ± 
 25, 370 ± 
 5, 400 ± 
 20, 440 ± 
 5, 480 ± 
 15, 
510 ± 5 and 535 ± 25. DIC/brightfield images were obtained at 561 nm (Zeiss microscope) or using low intensity 
white light irradiance (tungsten-halogen lamp) that evoked minimal activation of Ca2+. For white-light treat-
ment we used a full spectrum irradiance lamp (400–700 nm, Full Spectrum Solutions, Jackson, MI). Visible sun-
light energy was calculated assuming ~40% energy (of total 120 mW cm−2) in the 400–700 nm range. Irradiance 
was measured with a X-Cite Optical Power Meter calibrated for each wavelength, coupled to an objective plane 
power sensor (Lumen Dynamics Group Inc. Mississauga, Ontario). Temperature, unless otherwise indicated, was 
22–23 °C.
For Ca2+ imaging, cells were loaded with 5 μ 
M Fluo4-AM or Rhod-2-AM for 40 min and were washed in 
serum-depleted (< 
0.5% FBS) buffer. Fluo4 was excited at 480 ± 
 15 nm (0.5–30 mW cm−2) and emitted flu-
orescence was passed through a 535 ± 
 25 bandpass filter, Rhod-2 was excited at 540.5 ± 
 12.5 nm and emitted 
fluorescence measured at 630 ± 
 30 nm. Fluorescence was captured by a SPOT RT digital camera (Diagnostic 
Instruments, Sterling Heights, MI) and read into a computer. Analysis was performed offline using Simple PCI 
software (Compix Inc, Sewickley, PA). Maximal Fluo4 fluorescence (Fmax) was obtained by application of 10 μ 
M 
ionomycin at the end of the experiment as described previously49. For analysis of cumulative cell activation (% 
activation) the half-maximal Ca2+ increase for each cell was measured and scored in 2–4 s bins. A Ca2+ response 
was defined as greater than 20% change in fluorescence from the baseline.
HyPerRed imaging. 
For imaging H2O2, Jurkat cells were transfected by electroporation with 2 μ 
g HyperRed 
cDNA (Addgene). Cells were returned to culture for 48 h prior to measurements. HyperRed was excited with a 
540.5 ± 12.5 nm bandpass filter and emitted fluorescence measured at 620 ± 30 nm.
Pharmacology. 
Jurkat cells were pretreated with the following compounds: U73122 (500 nM, 5 min) 
U733433 (5 μ 
M, 5 min), wortmanin (1 μ 
M, 40 min), genestein (100 μ 
M, 40 min), PP2 (3 μ 
M, 40 min), PP3 (3 μ 
M, 
 40 min), CD45 inhibitor (N-(9,10-Dioxo-9,10-dihydro-phenanthren-2-yl)-2,2-dimethyl-propionamide; 1 μ 
M, 
120 min), ascorbic acid (10 mM, 40 min), docosahexaenoic acid, DHA (5–20 μ 
M, 20 min), β 
β 
 carotene (100 μ 
M, 
20 min), apocynin (100 μ 
M, 40 min), antimycin/rotenone/oligomcyin (20:20:5 μ 
M, 20 mins) and diphenyliodo-
nium (50 μ 
M, 40 mins). All treatment groups were compared to control cells incubated for the same period in 
normal buffer.
Chemotaxis and cell motility assays. 
Chemotaxis was assayed using the CytoSelect 96-well Cell 
Migration Assay Kit (3 μ 
m pore, Cell Biolabs, INC.) 5 × 
 105 Jurkat cells were suspended in serum free RPMI

media and loaded into the upper chamber of the transwell. The bottom chamber contained media and 40 ng/ml 
SDF-1α 
 (Peprotech Inc., Rocky Hill, NJ). Cells were irradiated with visible light (5–10 mW cm−2) or a blue light 
photodiode array (470 nm, 10 mW cm−2) and then incubated for 120 min at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator. Migrated 
cells were counted manually using a hemocytometer. Cell motility assays were performed on fibronectin (2 μ 
g/ml) 
 
coated coverslips at 30–32 °C. Individual cells were tracked using CellTrack software50. We analyzed cells for 4 min 
before and after blue-light irradiation.
Proliferation assays. 
Splenocytes were seeded in 96-well plates (2 × 
 105 cells per well) pre-coated with 
1–10 μ 
g/ml anti-CD3e (clone 145-2C11, BD Pharmingen). After 72 hours, cells were counted using MTT assay.
Immunoblotting. 
Jurkat cells were serum starved for 18 h in RPMI-1640 medium containing 0.5% BSA. 
2 × 
 106 cells were suspended in HANKS buffer containing 0.5% BSA and irradiated. Cells were lysed in RIPA 
buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% NP-40, 0.25% Na-deoxycholate, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 
1 mM PMSF, 1 mM Na3VO4, 1 mM NaF, and complete protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma Aldrich), followed by 
centrifugation at 14,000 rpm at 4 °C for 10 min. After protein concentrations were quantified, cell extract was 
mixed with NuPAGE® 
 LDS Sample Buffer and samples were loaded onto 4–12% polyacrylamide gels and pro-
teins were resolved by SDS-PAGE in a NuPAGE electrophoresis system (Invitrogen). Proteins were transferred 
to Polyvinylidene Difluoride (PVDF) membrane. Membranes were blocked for 1 h at room temperature with 5% 
skim milk and probed once with specific antibodies overnight at 4 °C. Immunoblots were then incubated with 
horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies diluted 1:5,000 for 1 h at RT. Protein bands were visual-
ized by the enhanced chemiluminescence reaction method (SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate 
Pierce). Band densities were quantified using ImageJ. We used the following antibodies: Rabbit Phospho-Zap-70 
(Tyr319) (Cell Signaling Technology), Rabbit Phospho-Src Family (Tyr416) (Cell Signaling Technology), Mouse 
β 
-Actin, OPN3, CRY1, CRY2, PLCγ 
-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc), PLCγ 
-1-phospho (Y783) (BioSource).
RT-PCR. 
We measured mRNA expression of the following opsins by RT-PCR: OPN1 (long and short-wave), 
OPN2, OPN3, OPN4, OPN5, peropsin and RGR using published primers.
RNA interference. 
Jurkat cells were transfected using the Amaxa nucleofection technology. Cells were 
resuspended in Amaxa Cell Line V nucleofector solution (2 × 
 106 per reaction) according to the manufacturer’s 
instructions. 5 μ 
M of siRNA (Ambion) were added and nucleofected using manufacturer program C16. Cells 
were then transferred to supplemented RPMI-1640 medium and the gene knockdown was analyzed after 24, 48 
and 72 hours at mRNA and protein level.
Chemicals. 
U73122, U733433 and CD45 inhibitor (CAS 345630-40-2) were purchased from Calbiochem. 
PP2 and PP3 were from Tocris. All other chemicals were from Sigma-Aldrich.
Statistical analysis. 
Data are presented as means ± 
 SE. Significance was assessed with the Student’s t test 
(P < 0.05 for significance).
