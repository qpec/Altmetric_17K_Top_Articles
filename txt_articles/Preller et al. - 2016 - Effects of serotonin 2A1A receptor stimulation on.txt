Social ties are crucial for physical and mental health. However,
psychiatric patients frequently encounter social rejection. More-
over, an increased reactivity to social exclusion influences the
development, progression, and treatment of various psychiatric
disorders. Nevertheless, the neuromodulatory substrates of re-
jection experiences are largely unknown. The preferential seroto-
nin (5-HT) 2A/1A receptor agonist, psilocybin (Psi), reduces the
processing of negative stimuli, but whether 5-HT2A/1A receptor
stimulation modulates the processing of negative social interac-
tions remains unclear. Therefore, this double-blind, randomized,
counterbalanced, cross-over study assessed the neural response to
social exclusion after the acute administration of Psi (0.215 mg/kg)
or placebo (Pla) in 21 healthy volunteers by using functional magnetic
resonance imaging (fMRI) and resting-state magnetic resonance
spectroscopy (MRS). Participants reported a reduced feeling of
social exclusion after Psi vs. Pla administration, and the neural
response to social exclusion was decreased in the dorsal anterior
cingulate cortex (dACC) and the middle frontal gyrus, key regions
for social pain processing. The reduced neural response in the
dACC was significantly correlated with Psi-induced changes in self-
processing and decreased aspartate (Asp) content. In conclusion,
5-HT2A/1A receptor stimulation with psilocybin seems to reduce
social pain processing in association with changes in self-experience.
These findings may be relevant to the normalization of negative
social interaction processing in psychiatric disorders characterized by
increased rejection sensitivity. The current results also emphasize the
importance of 5-HT2A/1A receptor subtypes and the Asp system in
the control of social functioning, and as prospective targets in the
treatment of sociocognitive impairments in psychiatric illnesses.

ysfunctional social cognition represents a central charac-
teristic of various psychiatric disorders and critically impacts
the development, progression, and treatment of psychiatric ill-
nesses (1–3). Impairments in social cognition are leading causes
of disability and compromise real-world functioning, including
independent living and productivity at work (2, 4, 5). However,
the neuronal and pharmacological bases of both normal and
dysfunctional social cognition lack sufficient investigation, se-
verely limiting current treatment approaches (1, 2). Given the
broad clinical relevance of dysfunctional social cognition in di-
verse psychiatric disorders, a better understanding of the neu-
robiological foundations of social cognition is urgently required
for the development of novel and targeted therapies (6).
Pharmacological neuroimaging offers the opportunity to in-
vestigate the roles of specific neurotransmitter and receptor
systems in a constrained hypothesis-driven manner (7, 8). Recent
evidence suggests that the serotonin [5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)]
system encompassing 14 subtypes of 5-HT receptors not only
plays a key role in the regulation of mood, affect, learning, and
memory (2, 9, 10), but is also implicated in social cognition (11,
12). Psilocybin [4-phosphoryloxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine (Psi)]
is a serotonergic hallucinogen that induces an altered state
of consciousness characterized by changes in sensory per-
ception, emotion, thought, and the sense of self in a dose-de-
pendent manner (13). Psi binds with high affinity to 5-HT1A,
5-HT2A/C, 5-HT6, and 5-HT7 receptors (Psychoactive Drug
Screening Program database at kidbdev.med.unc.edu/databases/
kidb.php). In humans, Psi is rapidly dephosphorylated to psilocin
(4-N,N-dimethyltryptamine), which acts as a partial agonist at
5-HT2A and 5-HT1A receptors (14, 15). Therefore, the use of Psi
provides a distinctive opportunity to explore the relative contribu-
tion of 5-HT receptors to social cognition.
Notably, Psi modulates neural activity in prefrontal brain areas
involved in social cognition (16–18). In addition, recent evidence
suggests that Psi at moderate doses can enhance mood and at-
tenuate the processing of negative emotional stimuli (e.g., neg-
ative facial expressions or threat-related scenes) (10, 19–21) via
5-HT2A receptor activation (20). Thus, Psi may have antide-
pressant properties (10, 19–22). Nevertheless, it is unclear
whether this shift in emotional processing translates into the
social domain, particularly regarding negative social interaction
processing, and is therefore of relevance to real-life functioning
in patients suffering from psychiatric disorders. To date, research
Significance
Social cognition critically impacts the development, progres-
sion, and treatment of psychiatric disorders. However, social
cognition skills are insufficiently targeted by current treatment
approaches. By applying a multimodal brain imaging strategy,
the present study demonstrated the importance of the sero-
tonin 2A/1A receptor system in the modulation of social ex-
clusion processing. Understanding the biochemical underpinnings
of the social rejection experience is important for increasing
our knowledge about social/emotional processing and the re-
lated neural responses. The identification of relevant neural
responses is in turn crucial for the efficacious management of
disorders influenced by social factors. Our findings may help to
diminish a knowledge gap that currently restrains the devel-
opment of pharmacotherapies for sociocognitive deficits in
psychiatric disorders.

 efforts into the effects of Psi on emotional processing and cognition
have solely focused on the individual’s response to external stimulus
manipulations (10, 20), as opposed to truly interactive, real-time
social encounters. Indeed, studies investigating the neurophar-
macological and neurochemical substrates of social interaction
processing are rare.
The present study set out to assess the effect of 5-HT2A/1A
receptor stimulation by Psi (0.215 mg/kg orally) vs. placebo (Pla)
on social interaction processing via a multimodal brain imaging
approach. Specifically, we used functional magnetic resonance
imaging (fMRI) and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy
(1H-MRS) to investigate the processing of ostracism generated
by an interactive paradigm termed “Cyberball” (23). Notably, an
increased reactivity to social exclusion is clinically relevant in
depression, borderline personality disorder, social anxiety disorder,
and other psychiatric disorders (24–26). Given previous reports
of the capacity of Psi to attenuate negative stimulus processing
(10, 20), we predicted a reduced response to social exclusion
after Psi administration.
“Social pain,” the painful feelings resulting from social ex-
clusion, rejection, or loss (27), is consistently associated with
increased brain activity. The increased activity is primarily ob-
served in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) (17), but is also
seen in the insula, the inferior orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), and
the middle frontal gyrus (MFG) (28, 29). Therefore, we hy-
pothesized that these social pain-related brain regions would
show less pronounced activation after Psi treatment. Further-
more, given that 5-HT1A receptor stimulation has been associ-
ated with decreased, and 5-HT2A receptor stimulation has been
associated with both decreased and increased, neuronal excita-
tion of medial prefrontal neurons at rest (30–32), we also used
1H-MRS to determine whether Psi modulates the concentration
of excitatory neurotransmitters and/or neurometabolic markers
in the ACC. Our findings, presented below, assist in under-
standing the neurobiology of social processes relevant to the
psychopathology of psychiatric disorders and contribute to a
better mechanistic view of social cognition.
Results
Subjective Effects and Physical Effects. An ANOVA (treatment ×
scale) was conducted for the Altered States of Consciousness
(5D-ASC) questionnaire, and revealed significant main effects
for treatment [F(1, 20) = 93.54, P < 0.001] and scale [F(10, 200) =
18.98, P < 0.001] and a significant interaction of treatment × scale
[F(10, 200) = 19.67, P < 0.001]. Simple main effect analyses showed
increased ratings on all 5D-ASC scales after Psi vs. Pla treatment
(all P < 0.05; Fig. S1). No order effects with regard to the sequence
of substance administration were observed (SI Results). For Positive
and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) ratings, see SI Results and
Fig. S2. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure as well as pulse
were slightly but significantly increased after Psi administration
compared with Pla (all P < 0.05; Table S1).
Cyberball Task.
Posttask questionnaire. Participants reported a reduced feeling of
exclusion after Psi vs. Pla treatment [t(20) = 2.71, P < 0.01; Fig. 1A].
Additional posttask questionnaire (PTQ) items revealed no signif-
icant differences between Psi and Pla conditions (all P > 0.1). In
particular, participants accurately gauged the number of throws
received in each run, indicating equal awareness of exclusion under
both treatment conditions (Table S2).
fMRI data. The “not receiving explicit social exclusion (ESE) >
receiving inclusion (INCL)” contrast in the Pla condition revealed
significant activation in brain regions of interest (ROIs) commonly
associated with social exclusion processing: the bilateral anterior
midcingulate cortex (aMCC), bilateral posterior MCC (pMCC),
left inferior OFC, and bilateral MFG (see Table S3 for whole-
brain results). To assess whether social exclusion was processed
differently after Psi vs. Pla administration, we compared the “not
receiving ESE > receiving INCL” contrast between Pla and Psi
conditions. Brain activation was significantly less pronounced in
the right aMCC and left MFG for Psi vs. Pla (Fig. 1B; see Table
S4 for whole-brain results). Because these areas have been
shown to represent key regions for social exclusion processing,
these results suggest that Psi administration reduced the pro-
cessing of social pain. No significant differences in activation
were found for the inverse comparison (Psi > Pla) for the “not
receiving ESE > receiving INCL” contrast.
The “not receiving implicit social exclusion (ISE) > receiving
INCL” contrast in the Pla condition revealed significant activa-
tion in the left anterior and posterior MCC and the right pre-
genual ACC (Table S3). Comparison of the “not receiving ISE >
receiving INCL” contrast revealed significantly reduced activa-
tion in the bilateral anterior and posterior MCC and the left
pregenual ACC in the Psi vs. Pla condition (Table S4). No signifi-
cant differences in activation were found for the Psi > Pla com-
parison for the “not receiving ISE > receiving INCL” contrast.
Context-specific effects (33) were investigated by computing
the “not receiving INCL > receiving INCL” contrast. This con-
trast revealed significant activation in the left subgenual ACC for
Pla (Table S3). The same contrast showed no significant differences
in activation for Psi vs. Pla administration (Table S4), indicating
that Psi did not significantly modulate the processing of “not re-
ceiving the ball” without an exclusion context. Again, no significant
differences in activation were found for the Psi > Pla comparison
for the “not receiving INCL > receiving INCL” contrast.
Relationship Between Social Exclusion Processing and Subjective
Effects. A correlation analysis was conducted to evaluate the
association between the difference between Pla > Psi conditions
in (i) BOLD responses to the “not receiving ESE > receiving
INCL” contrast in the right MCC and left MFG, and (ii)

 subjective drug effects (5D-ASC, PANAS) and PTQ items. A
significant positive correlation was found between the difference
in activation in the right MCC and the 5D-ASC scale “experience
of unity“ in the Psi condition (r = 0.53, P < 0.02; Fig. 1C). No
other significant correlations between BOLD responses and sub-
jective drug effects were observed (all P > 0.08), and no significant
correlations were found between differences in BOLD responses
and differences in PANAS scores or PTQ items (all P > 0.1).
Relationship Between Social Exclusion Processing and Metabolite
Concentrations. Brain region activation after Psi treatment was
significantly reduced in response to the “not receiving ESE >
receiving INCL” contrast in the aMCC, and overlapped with the
dorsal ACC (dACC) voxel established for MRS acquisition (Fig.
2A). To explore the relationship between Psi-induced differences
in social exclusion processing and metabolite concentrations,
correlational analyses were computed for the difference in ac-
tivity between the Pla and Psi conditions in the dACC voxel used
for MRS measurement and the baseline-corrected metabolite
concentration in the Psi condition as well as the metabolite
concentrations in the Psi follow-up measurement. A significant
correlation was obtained between activity in the dACC voxel
computed for the “not receiving ESE > receiving INCL” contrast
and baseline-corrected aspartate (Asp) concentration (r = 0.80,
P < 0.001, n = 19; Fig. 2B). Congruently, a significant correlation
was observed between Asp concentration in the Psi follow-up mea-
surement and activity in the dACC voxel (r = −0.56, P < 0.02, n =
19). No significant correlations were found for other baseline-cor-
rected or follow-up metabolite concentrations (all P > 0.17). For data
and fit quality measures, see SI Results, MRS Data Quality and Fig. S3.
Discussion
The present study used a multimodal brain imaging approach to
show that the processing of social pain is reduced after 5-HT2A/1A
receptor stimulation by Psi; furthermore, this reduced response
to social exclusion involved changes in cingulate Asp concen-
trations and changes in the experience of self. In agreement with
previous studies of social exclusion and rejection (28, 29, 33–35;
for reviews see refs. 27 and 36), we demonstrated that experi-
ences of social exclusion vs. inclusion in the Pla condition in-
volved the aMCC, pMCC, MFG, and inferior OFC. These brain
areas are commonly associated with feelings of exclusion. Im-
portantly, 5-HT2A/1A receptor stimulation by Psi significantly
reduced activation of the aMCC and MFG in response to social
exclusion. The aMCC, also termed the dACC (17, 37), represents a
key region in social exclusion processing (17, 36). In particular,
dACC activation is related to experiences of fear and anxiety,
emotional distress, and social pain (17, 29, 37). Consistent with
these observations, the current findings strongly suggest that Psi
decreases the experience of social pain. Moreover, the frontal
cortex also plays a regulatory role in social exclusion processing
(29, 38). More specifically, activation in the MFG can lead to
inhibition of affective distress and social pain (29, 39). Because
Psi seems to reduce affective distress following social rejection,
the decreased BOLD signal in the MFG observed herein after
Psi administration possibly stemmed from a diminished need to
block stressful experiences.
Here, implicit social exclusion relative to inclusion signifi-
cantly recruited the aMCC, pMCC, and ventral ACC in the Pla
condition. Activation in the MFG was not significant for ISE,
contrary to ESE. This result supports previous findings showing
increased ACC activity, but not self-regulatory responses, in
frontal areas for ISE (29). Psi treatment reduced the response to
ISE in the aMCC, pMCC, and ventral ACC, suggesting that Psi
diminishes reactions to social exclusion even in an implicit, and
therefore possibly more subtle, context. To investigate whether
Psi-induced alterations in neural responses to the event of “not
receiving the ball” are attributable to this specific event or are
instead sensitive to the game context, we also analyzed the “not
receiving > receiving the ball” contrast while participants were
included in the game (33). In line with a previous study applying
an event-related analysis to the Cyberball paradigm (33), this
contrast recruited the subgenual ACC in the Pla condition.
However, no significant differences were found between Pla and
Psi for this contrast, indicating that Psi modulates the response
to “not receiving the ball” only in conditions where the participant is
actually excluded from the game, corroborating the interpretation
that 5-HT2A/1A receptor stimulation by Psi apparently weakens the
distressing affective response to social rejection.
In agreement with a decreased neural response to social ex-
clusion, participants reported that they felt less excluded in the
Psi vs. Pla condition on the PTQ. However, other ratings (e.g.,
self-esteem, meaningful existence, control, inclusion, belonging-
ness, and liking) were not significantly altered by Psi; this sug-
gests that Psi-mediated stimulation of the 5-HT2A/1A receptor
may specifically reduce the feeling of being excluded, which is
apparently not influenced by other social parameters. Addi-
tionally, no significant differences were found between Pla and
Psi conditions for estimates of received throws, indicating that
participants were equally aware of exclusion in both treatment
conditions. Therefore, the reduced response to social exclusion is
unlikely due to decreased attentiveness to the exclusion.
In the present study, the Psi-induced alterations on the 5D-
ASC and increased scores for basic positive mood were generally
similar to those observed in previous studies using comparable
drug doses (10, 22). The low ratings on the 5D-ASC scale
“anxiety” (mean score: 7.5%, maximum score: 46%) are in ac-
cordance with previous studies suggesting that even during peak
effects Psi is well tolerated and rarely produces profound or
psychotic anxiety in a controlled clinical setting in healthy human
subjects (13). Moreover, the Psi-induced reduction in dACC
activity in response to social exclusion showed significant cor-
relations with scores for the feeling of unity. The 5D-ASC feeling
of unity scale incorporates items assessing alterations in the
sense of self/self-boundaries, such as feelings of being connected
and/or one with the environment (40). The correlation between
experience of unity and social pain processing may indicate that
alterations in the sense of self after Psi administration are im-
portant for changes in social interaction processing, adding em-
pirical evidence to the notion that concepts of self and others are
closely intertwined (41), which suggests that the sense of self can
profoundly impact the experience of interpersonal relationships.
The Psi-induced feeling of being connected with and embedded
in the environment may also lead to an intensified connection

 between oneself and other human beings, as well as stronger
identification and empathic encounters with others. This feeling
may assist in reducing egocentric bias and consequently render
negative experiences more bearable. This interpretation is also
supported by previous studies reporting that the ACC is partic-
ularly involved in self/other representations and theory of mind
(42). Moreover, the Psi-mediated feeling of being embedded in
the environment may even be beneficial in therapeutic settings,
supporting the relationship between patient and therapist, and
facilitating the discussion of painful experiences in a protective
and secure environment. In contrast to earlier work investigating
the effect of Psi on nonsocial negative stimuli (10), the current
data did not reveal any significant associations between BOLD
responses and social exclusion or mood. Therefore, modulations
of social interaction processing may be mostly independent of
Psi-induced increases in positive mood.
To further examine the neurochemical substrates of altered social
exclusion processing, changes in metabolite concentrations obtained
by 1H-MRS measurements were correlated with changes in the
BOLD signal responses to social exclusion. These analyses showed
that a reduction in Asp content between baseline (before drug
administration) and follow-up (Psi condition, measured after sub-
jects had completed the Cyberball task) was significantly correlated
with a reduced BOLD signal in the dACC in response to social
exclusion (Psi vs. Pla condition). Even though the complex reso-
nance pattern of Asp showing overlaps with various other metab-
olites is difficult to quantify with in vivo MRS, the used JPRESS
acquisition together with Profit2 fitting allowed an Asp quantifica-
tion with CRLBs around 6% and low SD, indicating good and
homogeneous data quality. Together, these findings may indicate
that changes in Asp levels are related to social pain processing.
Glutamate (Glu) and Asp are present in high concentrations
in the central nervous system; both have excitatory effects on
neurons, with Asp preferentially activating NMDA receptors
(43). Moreover, functionally or pharmacologically induced
changes in neurotransmission and brain energy metabolism un-
derlying the origin of the BOLD signal are linked to changes in
Glu and Asp concentrations as a consequence of an increased
rate of the malate–aspartate shuttle, which is associated with the
increased flux into the tricarboxylic acid cycle (44, 45). In-
terestingly, the structurally related psychotropic 5-HT2A/1A
agonist lysergic acid diethylamide increases extracellular medial
prefrontal Glu release and prefrontal pyramidal cell activity in
rodents (46, 47). However, in our study, BOLD reductions to
social exclusion in the dACC were related to changes in Asp
content exclusively, and no correlations with changes in Glu
concentrations were found. Hence, the interpretation of our
findings remains somewhat speculative because the effects of Psi
on Asp release are currently novel and have not yet been
reported in animal and human studies and therefore require
further investigation. Because extrasynaptic and intrasynaptic
pools of Asp and Glu cannot be distinguished by spectroscopic
imaging, no general conclusions can be drawn from metabolite
concentrations to the process of neurotransmission. However,
recent studies have consistently reported small concentration
changes in lactate, Glu, Asp, and glucose in the human cortex
during prolonged stimulation (48, 49). Positive linear relation-
ships between metabolic and BOLD responses in the presence of
excitatory sensory inputs could be found for Glu and lactate
concentrations (48). In contrast, inverse correlations between
BOLD responses and MRS measures were found for GABA
concentrations (48, 50, 51). In line with these findings, we argue
in favor of an emerging conceptual framework to interpret
multimodal imaging findings including changes in metabolite
concentrations and BOLD signals in terms of brain energetics
and neurotransmission. In addition, a recent study proposed the
existence of a neuron-to-astrocyte Asp transcellular pathway
required for astrocyte Glu synthesis and subsequent glutamine
formation (52). Accordingly, the relationship among decreased
Asp levels, reduced BOLD responses, and social pain might in-
dicate a possible role of glial Glu metabolism in the processing of
social pain signals in the dACC. In conclusion, further studies would
be needed to corroborate the hypothetical functional links between
Asp levels and BOLD responses that we observed in our study.
To our knowledge, the current study represents the first
multimodal brain imaging approach to investigate the neuro-
pharmacological grounds of social exclusion processing, and
particularly the influence of 5-HT receptor stimulation on neg-
ative social interactions. Evidence from animal studies suggests
that the opioid system may similarly participate in the experience
of pain and distress in response to maternal–infant separation
(53). Furthermore, another study showed that chronic adminis-
tration of the analgesic acetaminophen reduced neural responses
to social rejection in the dACC and anterior insula, but not self-
reported social distress after exclusion (54). However, the exact
action mechanism of acetaminophen is still unclear. Additional
behavioral analyses suggested that oxytocin does not buffer
against the experience of social pain after social rejection (55).
Moreover, recent work (56) found that administration of
3,4-methylenedioxy-methamphetamine (MDMA), a 5-HT, dopa-
mine, and norepinephrine releasing agent/reuptake inhibitor
(57), decreased the effect of social exclusion on mood and self-
esteem, but not on physiological measures. The authors pro-
posed that MDMA selectively decreased the perceived intensity
of rejection, as indicated by increased estimates of received
throws in the exclusion condition. Therefore, whereas MDMA
seems to affect the perception of social exclusion, Psi may ac-
tually reduce the experience of social pain itself without signifi-
cantly influencing the awareness of being excluded. The current
study therefore represents to our knowledge the first indication
that stimulation of the 5-HT2A/1A receptor system can regulate
social pain processing and experience. The results are consistent
with previous reports suggesting that the 5-HT system plays a
role in emotional regulation (10, 20, 21), and may also be rele-
vant for social cognition and behavior (11, 12); they likewise
support earlier studies showing that 5-HT2A receptors are highly
expressed in prefrontal brain areas and emphasize the impor-
tance of these receptors for prefrontal brain function (58).
Considering that most previous studies investigating the role of
5-HT in social processes were conducted by using selective se-
rotonin reuptake inhibitors to increase 5-HT levels, the current
study extends these findings by showing that direct receptor
simulation contributes to modulations of social cognition. Fur-
thermore, our work highlights the importance of the 5-HT2A/1A
receptor system not only in perception but also in the actual
experience of social encounters, as indicated by the interactive
nature of the Cyberball paradigm (27).
The multimodal brain imaging approach applied in this study
offers the possibility of exploring neurobiological processes un-
derlying the experience of social pain. Our findings indicate that Psi
acts on brain areas associated with the experience of social pain via
alterations in Glu/Asp metabolism. The current results must be
interpreted with the following limitation in mind—namely, that the
results of pharmacological MRI studies may be susceptible to drug
effects on cerebral vasoactivity (8). However, two previous fMRI
investigations of Psi actions found no effect of nonneural physio-
logical changes or Psi itself on the vascular system of the brain (10,
16). Furthermore, psilocybin has been shown to reduce the BOLD
signal in the dACC during resting state (16). It is therefore possible
that the reduction of BOLD signal in the dACC reported in the
current study might relate to a general reduction of neuronal ac-
tivity within this area; however, this is unlikely considering that no
decrease in BOLD signal was found for the “not receiving INCL >
receiving INCL” contrast after Psi administration compared with
Pla, indicating that the decreased BOLD response is related to
the exclusion context. Furthermore, conflicting results have been

 obtained between PET and fMRI regarding resting state activity
in the ACC after Psi administration, with a previous study
showing increases in glucose metabolism in the dACC PET (18).
However, the current study reports alterations in regional brain
activity that are task specific and rely on contrasts between two
conditions of this task. Therefore, we cannot make any conclu-
sions about a general increase or decrease in neuronal activity in
the ACC after Psi administration.
In summary, the present results suggest that 5-HT2A/1A receptor
stimulation by Psi attenuates social pain processing, possibly in
parallel with alterations in Glu/Asp metabolism and release.
Furthermore,
receptor
stimulation
is
also
associated
with
changes in self-processing, particularly the feeling of being con-
nected with the environment. Social ties have repeatedly been
shown to be crucial for physical and mental health (59, 60), and
psychiatric patients often encounter social rejection (61). Addi-
tionally, perceived social isolation has a negative impact on social
and general cognition, often leading to negative social interactions
and a vicious cycle of social rejection (62). Patients suffering from
major depressive disorder exhibit information acquisition and pro-
cessing that is biased toward negative stimuli, which features pre-
dominantly in the development and maintenance of depression
(63). This negative emotional bias is related inter alia to functional
alterations in the ACC and frontal brain areas (63). Therefore,
the current study validates reports suggesting that Psi may have
antidepressant characteristics (10, 16), possibly by mitigating
negative emotional bias (10, 20, 21). Last, the present results
show that Psi may normalize the processing of negative social
interaction in disorders characterized by increased rejection
sensitivity through the adjustment of dACC and frontal brain
activity, and by changes in self-processing. However, because this
study was conducted in healthy volunteers, it has to be inter-
preted with the limitation in mind that the results may not di-
rectly translate to psychiatric patients with severe social exclusion
experiences, such as schizophrenia patients (3).
Understanding the neural and biochemical foundations of
rejection experiences is important for increasing our knowledge
about social and emotional processes, and is crucial for the
treatment of conditions influenced by social factors (3, 35, 54).
Therefore, our findings may assist in diminishing a knowledge
gap that restrains the development of pharmacotherapies for
sociocognitive deficits in psychiatric disorders. The current re-
sults also emphasize the contribution of 5-HT2A/1A receptor
subtypes and the Glu/Asp system in the regulation of social
functioning, and their utility as prospective targets in the man-
agement of sociocognitive impairments.
Methods
Study Participants. The data of 21 healthy participants were included in the
statistical analyses (n = 12 males and 9 females; mean age = 26.48 y; SD =
4.76 y; range = 20–37 y). For further details, see SI Methods. The MRS data of
two subjects were excluded in the corresponding analyses due to premature
termination of MRS acquisition. Subjects received written and oral descrip-
tions of the study procedures, as well as details regarding the effects and
possible risks of Psi treatment. All participants provided written informed
consent statements in accordance with the declaration of Helsinki before
participation in the study. The Swiss Federal Office of Public Health, Bern,
Switzerland, authorized the use of Psi in humans, and the study was ap-
proved by the Cantonal Ethics Committee of Zurich.
Study Design. This study was designed as a randomized, double-blind, pla-
cebo-controlled, within-subject investigation. Subjects received either Pla
(maltose) or oral Psi (0.215 mg/kg) in two separate sessions spaced at least 10 d
apart. The dose of 0.215 mg/kg was chosen based on previous studies showing
that it is well tolerated in healthy subjects (13) and attenuates the processing
of negative emotional stimuli (20). For details, see SI Methods.
Cyberball Task. While undergoing fMRI, participants completed an interactive
virtual ball-tossing game called Cyberball that simulates a real-life interactive
experience of social exclusion (23). For details, see SI Methods and Fig. S4.
Briefly, participants played three rounds of Cyberball during separate fMRI
scans, each representing one of the following conditions: (i) ISE, where
participants were informed that due to technical difficulties the internet
connection could not be established, but that they could watch the other
participants playing; (ii) INCL, where participants were told that they were
connected and could join in with the other players; and (iii) ESE, where
participants received five throws and were then excluded from the game
(i.e., the other players stopped throwing the ball to the participant for the
remainder of the scan). Immediately after the scanning session, partici-
pants completed the PTQ. For details, see SI Methods.
MRI Data Acquisition and Preprocessing. MRI data were acquired by using a
Philips Achieva 3.0T whole-body scanner (Philips Healthcare). Care was taken
to ensure the comfort of the study participants on the scanner bed. To this
end, the study protocol used inflatable Multipad pillows (Pearltec). A 32-
channel receive-only phased-array head coil and MultiTransmit parallel radio
frequency transmission technology were used to collect the fMRI data. For
further details, see SI Methods. A birdcage transmit–receive passed-array
head coil with a maximum B1 = 20 μT was used for collection of MRS data.
Therefore, subjects were repositioned in different coils between MRS and
fMRI scans to gain optimal data quality for the different modalities. During
the 1H-MRS measurements, participants were not engaged in a task, but
were instead instructed to lie as still as possible in the scanner. A 1-mm3
isotropic high-resolution T1-weighted image was used for voxel planning. A
maximum echo J-resolved 1H-MRS protocol (64) was established to acquire
spectra from an anatomical ROI of 32 (AP) × 21 (RL) × 24 (FH) mm3 in the
dACC. The ROI was selected based on previous work highlighting the role of
the ACC in social cognition (17), as well as changes in brain perfusion and
glucose metabolism after Psi administration detected by PET (18). Measured
data were quantified by using Profit2 software (65) to enable the detection
of up to 18 different metabolites (N-acetylaspartate, creatine, choline, myo-
inositol, Glu, glutamine, N-acetylaspartylglutamate, gamma-aminobutyric
acid, glucose, lactate, scyllo-inositol, taurine, glycine, glutathione, phos-
phoethanolamine, Asp, ascorbate, and acetate). For details, see SI Methods.
Statistical Analysis.
Questionnaires and physical effects. Repeated-measures ANOVAs with treat-
ment (Pla vs. Psi) and scale as within-subject factors were conducted to an-
alyze 5D-ASC ratings. For analysis of PANAS ratings, time (pre-drug
administration vs. post-drug administration) was introduced as an additional
within-subjects factor. Paired t tests were applied to analyze PTQ items as
well as pulse and systolic/diastolic blood pressure. Significant main effects or
interactions were followed by Bonferroni-corrected pairwise comparisons
and simple main effects analyses, respectively. The confirmatory statistical
comparisons of all data were carried out with a significance level of P < 0.05
(two-tailed test). Analyses were conducted by using IBM SPSS Statistics 21
software (IBM). For details, see SI Methods.
fMRI data. The fMRI images were analyzed by using a general linear model
implemented in the SPM8 software package and an event-related design (33).
For details, see SI Methods.
Correlation analyses. Correlation analyses were conducted to further in-
vestigate the relationship between Psi-induced differences in social exclusion
processing and subjective effects. Furthermore, the relationship between Pla–
Psi differences in social exclusion processing and changes in metabolite
concentrations was explored. For details, see SI Methods.
