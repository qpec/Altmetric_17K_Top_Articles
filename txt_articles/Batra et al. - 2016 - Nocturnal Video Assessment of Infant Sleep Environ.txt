abstract
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Reports describing factors associated with sleep-related infant 
death rely on caregiver report or postmortem findings. We sought to determine the 
frequency of environmental risk factors by using nocturnal sleep videos of infants.
METHODS: Healthy, term newborns were recruited for a parent study examining the role of 
parenting in the development of nighttime infant sleep patterns. For 1 night at ages 1, 3, and 
6 months, video recordings were conducted within family homes. Videos were coded for 
sudden infant death syndrome risk factors in post hoc secondary analyses after the parent 
study was completed.
RESULTS: Among 160 one-month-olds, initially 21% were placed to sleep on nonrecommended 
sleep surfaces and 14% were placed nonsupine; 91% had loose/nonapproved items 
on their sleep surface, including bedding, bumper pads, pillows, stuffed animals, 
and sleep positioners. Among 151 three-month-olds, 10% were initially placed on a 
nonrecommended sleep surface, 18% were placed nonsupine, and 87% had potentially 
hazardous items on their sleep surface. By 6 months, 12% of the 147 infants initially slept 
on a nonrecommended surface, 33% were placed to bed nonsupine, and 93% had loose/
nonrecommended items on their surface. At 1, 3, and 6 months, 28%, 18%, and 12% 
changed sleep locations overnight, respectively, with an increased likelihood of bed-sharing 
and nonsupine position at the second location at each time point.
CONCLUSIONS: Most parents, even when aware of being recorded, placed their infants in sleep 
environments with established risk factors. If infants were moved overnight, the second 
sleep environment generally had more hazards.

WHAT’S KNOWN ON THIS SUBJECT: Risk and 
protective factors for sleep-related infant death, 
including sudden infant death syndrome, have been 
established by epidemiologic studies. These reports 
are typically limited by subjective reporting by 
parents/caregivers or postmortem fi
 ndings and may 
underestimate the prevalence of these factors.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: Most parents placed their 
infants in sleep environments with established risk 
factors. When infants were moved to a different 
sleep environment in the middle of the night, the 
new sleep environment often included more unsafe 
elements.

BATRA et al 
Sleep-related infant deaths, the 
most common cause of postneonatal 
infant mortality, 
 
1 are defined as 
deaths occurring during sleep or in 
a sleep environment, and include 
sudden infant death syndrome 
(SIDS), accidental suffocation and 
strangulation in bed, and ill-defined 
deaths. Risk factors that have been 
associated with sleep-related deaths 
include, but are not limited to, 
side and prone sleeping, soft sleep 
surface, loose bedding, bed-sharing, 
tobacco use, and not breastfeeding. 
2 
Efforts to eliminate risk factors began 
in 1992 in the United States, when 
the American Academy of Pediatrics 
(AAP) recommended against 
prone positioning. 
3 Subsequent 
AAP guidelines, 
 
4, 
5 the most recent 
published in 2011, 
 
2 have also 
recommended avoidance of “soft 
materials in the infant’s sleeping 
environment” and room-sharing 
without bed-sharing.
Despite substantial publicity for 
these recommendations and public 
education campaigns, many of 
these recommendations are not 
fully followed by parents. Data from 
the National Infant Sleep Position 
Study (NISP) report that 73% of 
parents placed their infants in a 
nonsupine position for sleep in 
2010, 
 
6 that rates of bed-sharing 
doubled from 6.5% in 1993 to 13.5% 
in 2010, 
 
7 and that 55% of parents 
continue to use loose bedding 
in the infant sleep environment, 
despite recommendations to the 
contrary by the AAP. 
8 Data also 
show that soft bedding and bumpers 
continue to be found in the cribs of 
infants who died in sleep-related 
deaths. 
9 However, publications 
describing parental practice have 
been limited by their methods. They 
have typically been based on either 
parental self-report or death scene 
investigations. Some studies have 
used video recording to analyze the 
safety of sleep environments, 
10, 
 
11 
but none used direct observation 
to quantify modifiable risk factors 
in infant sleep environments. To 
overcome previous limitations, the 
present study analyzed nocturnal 
sleep videos collected from a 
parent, longitudinal study of infant 
sleep arrangements, maternal 
endorsement of these arrangements, 
and their association with emotional 
and marital difficulties. 
12 The aim 
of this secondary analysis was to 
determine the frequency of known 
risk factors for sleep-related infant 
deaths by using these objective data 
in the 6 months after birth.
METHODS
Participants
The parent study was an 
observational evaluation of families 
whose newborns were delivered at 
2 hospitals in central Pennsylvania. 
Mothers were approached within 48 
hours of delivery by project staff, who 
described the study and provided 
contact information on a handout. 
Those participating were healthy, 
term newborns. All mothers were 
aged ≥18 years, of any ethnicity, 
fluent in English, and living with their 
infants as an independent family unit. 
Interested mothers were called at 
home within 3 weeks of discharge, 
and a home visit was scheduled 4 to 6 
weeks after delivery. All participating 
mothers provided informed consent 
before enrollment, and they 
completed a baseline demographic 
questionnaire. 
This study was approved by the Penn 
State University’s Office of Research 
Protections and the secondary 
analysis was approved by Penn State 
College of Medicine’s Human Subjects 
Protection Office.
Study Procedures
At infant ages 1, 3, and 6 months, 
research staff visited each family 
to set up video equipment in the 
area(s) of the home where the infant 
commonly slept. The equipment 
consisted of a Bosch Divar XF 8 
channel digital video recorder 
(Bosch, Fairpoint, NY), Infrared 
Color Couple Charged Device (ML) 
Cameras (Spectral Instruments 
Inc, Tuscan, AZ), Channel Vision 
5014 Microphones (Channel Vision 
Technology, Costa Mesa, CA), and 
an Audiovox D9000 Portable DVD/
CD Player (Voxx Electronics Corp, 
Hauppauge, NY). All cameras were 
wired directly to the digital video 
recorder by using Mini coaxial cable 
television cables with an option of 
a wireless setup by using a Video 
Transmitter Kit from Videocomm 
Technologies (Burlington, ON, 
Canada). Up to 3 more cameras were 
placed for each family depending 
on parental reports of bedtime or 
sleep locations. For all families, 1 
camera and microphone setup were 
suspended on a boom stand above 
the infant’s primary sleep location to 
provide a clear view of the infant’s 
head, body, and primary sleep 
surface. Other cameras were set 
up to provide alternate views or in 
alternative sleep locations. Infrared 
illuminators were set up to provide 
bounce lighting to illuminate the 
infants’ room if needed. At each study 
time point, video recordings were 
initiated by parents 1 hour before 
the start of bedtime. Recordings 
continued throughout the night until 
the infant was fully awake in the 
morning.
Video Analysis
After downloading the recordings 
to an external hard drive, the videos 
were viewed by using Bosch Divar 
XF/700 Software 3.33. Videos 
were reviewed and coded by 1 of 
2 research assistants with data 
entered, including sleep location(s), 
surface(s), position(s), and other 
objects on or around the sleep 
surface. For purposes of assessing 
inter-rater reliability, a total of 
56 videos (25 at 1 month, 16 at 3 
months, and 15 at 6 months) were 
coded by both research assistants, 
and Cohen’s κ statistic was 
calculated.

perfect or near perfect agreement, 
with values of 1.00 for sleep surface 
and position, 0.94 for sleep location, 
and 0.87 to 0.95 for each individual 
object on or around the sleep 
surface. For statistical analysis, 
data coded from video recordings 
were summarized and/or described 
by using frequency counts and 
percentages for categorical variables 
and means, SDs, medians, and ranges 
for continuous variables.
RESULTS
Demographic Characteristics
Of the 167 infants enrolled in the 
study, 162 (97%) had at least 1 video 
and comprised our analysis sample. 
Of these, 142 (88%) had videos from 
all 3 time points. One hundred sixty 
of the infants were observed at 1 
month of age (median, 1.2 months; 
range, 0.9–1.9 months), 151 at 3 
months (median, 3.1 months; range, 
2.3–4 months), and 147 at 6 months 
(median, 6.1 months; range, 4.8–7.3 
months). Forty-eight percent of the 
infants were male ( 
Table 1). The 
median age of mothers and fathers 
was 29 and 32 years, respectively. 
Eighty-four percent of the mothers 
and 85% of the fathers were white, 
and most parents attended at least 
some college. More than 80% of 
mothers were married and living 
with their partner. Exclusive 
breastfeeding was reported for 59%, 
52%, and 18% of infants at 1, 3, and 
6 months, respectively. Regarding 
attrition, there were no demographic 
differences between those who did 
and did not complete the 6-month 
observation period. Those who 
dropped out were less likely to 
breastfeed at 1 and 3 months, 
compared with those who remained 
in the study for 6 months.
Sleep Position and Environment
1-Month Videos
Fifty-eight percent of 1-month-old 
infants began the night in their 
parents’ room, and the majority 
(79%) were on an AAP-approved 
sleep surface (eg, crib, cradle, 
bassinet, playpen) ( 
Table 2). A 
playpen is defined as a portable play 
yard that conforms to standards set 
by the US Consumer Product Safety 
Commission. 
14 Although 86% were 
initially placed supine, 12 (8%) and 
7 (4%) were placed in the side and 
prone positions, respectively. Nearly 
all (91%) participants had a loose/
nonapproved item on their sleep 
surface. The most common items 
were loose bedding, bumper pads, 
pillows, stuffed animals, and sleep 
positioners.
Forty-five (28%) infants slept in 
at least 2 locations at the 1-month 
observation; 91% of infants ended up 
on a nonapproved sleep surface (eg, 
adult bed, sofa, car seat, co-sleeper, or 
swing) for the second sleep location. 
Only 64% were placed in a supine 
position at this second location, and 
67% shared their sleep surface with 
another person ( 
Table 3). When the 
entire night was considered, 36% of 
the cohort of 160 infants were placed 
nonsupine, and 28% shared a sleep 
surface at some point in the night.
3-Month Videos
About one-half (52%) of 3-month-old 
infants began the night in their own 
room, and 90% were on an AAP-
approved sleep surface. Eighty-two 
percent began the night supine, with 
10% and 8% being placed on their 
side and prone, respectively, and 
87% had loose/nonapproved items 
in their sleep environment.
Twenty-seven (18%) infants slept in 
at least 2 locations, with an increase 
in unsafe sleep risk factors in the

second location; the proportion of 
infants sleeping in a crib, bassinet, or 
playpen decreased from 93% to 11%, 
only one-third were placed supine, 
and 81% shared their sleep surface 
with another person. When the entire 
night was considered, 35% of the 
cohort of 151 infants were placed 
nonsupine, 22% shared a sleep 
surface, and 89% slept with loose and 
nonapproved items at some point 
during the night.
6-Month Videos
Two-thirds (69%) of 6-month-old 
infants began the night in their own 
room, and 88% were on an AAP-
approved sleep surface. Sixty-seven 
percent were placed supine in their 
initial sleep location, with 15% and 
17% being placed on their side and 
prone, respectively, and 93% had 
loose/nonapproved items in their 
sleep environment.
Eighteen infants (12%) slept in at 
least 2 locations, with an increase in 
unsafe sleep risk factors in the second 
location; there was a decrease in the 
proportion of infants sleeping in a crib, 
bassinet, cradle, or playpen from 78% 
to 17%, a decrease in supine sleep 
position (50% to 22%), and an increase 
in the sleep surface being shared with 
another person (17% to 67%). When 
the entire night was considered, 44% 
of the 147 infants with 6-month videos 
were placed nonsupine, 16% shared 
a sleep surface, and 93% had a loose 
or nonapproved item in their sleep 
environment at some point during the 
night.
DISCUSSION
Our data show that most parents, 
even when they were aware of being 
recorded, placed their infants in sleep 
environments with established risk 
factors for sleep-related infant deaths. 
In addition, infants being moved in the 
middle of the night were often moved 
to more unsafe sleep environments 
than where they began the night. 
These objective findings overcome the 
common limitations for research on 
sleep-related infant deaths and risk 
factors, as they are not self-reported, 
and suggest that current public 
education and health care provider 
guidance related to safe infant sleep 
are not being carefully adhered 
to, even in a relatively educated, 
affluent patient population. Although 
the parent study that supported 
this analysis was not designed or 
originally intended to serve as an 
evaluation of SIDS risk factors, 
these findings are a reminder that 
efforts to improve parent education 
and understand real-world parent 
practices must continue.
These objective data may help to 
explain some of the discordance 
in reporting of risk factors in the 
sleep environment for healthy living 
infants and for infants who have 
died suddenly and unexpectedly. 
The NISP, an annual cross-sectional 
telephone survey conducted from 
1992 to 2010, provided parent-
reported data about infant sleep 
practices and reported that 
approximately three-quarters of 
infants were both placed supine 
6 and 
in a crib or bassinet. 
7 This finding is 
consistent with our data for initial 
position and placement. However, 
when we included subsequent 
position and placement in the middle 
of the night, 38% of infants were ever 
placed nonsupine during the night, 
and 91% of 1-month-old infants who 
were moved during the night ended 
up in an unsafe environment. These 
findings are more consistent with

data from Child Death Review teams, 
which reported that in sleep-related 
deaths, 38% of infants were found 
on their stomach, and only 28% of 
infants were found in a crib, bassinet, 
or playpen. 
15
We also found higher rates of 
bed-sharing and loose bedding 
in the environment than studies 
relying on parental report have 
noted. The most recent report from 
NISP demonstrated that 13.5% of 
families usually shared a bed. 
7 Our 
observations found that a sleep 
surface was shared by 28%, 23%, and 
16% of infants during a single night’s 
observation at 1, 3, and 6 months, 
respectively. Importantly, <10% 
at each time point were observed 
sharing a surface at the beginning of 
the night, but this scenario increased 
overnight. Interestingly, Colvin et al 
15 
reported that 69% of infant deaths 
reviewed by Child Death Review 
teams occurred while the infant was 
sharing a sleep surface. Similarly, 
NISP reported a lower rate (55%) of 
soft or loose bedding use, 
 
8 compared 
with ∼75% in our observations. 
However, this difference may be 
partially explained by how bedding 
was defined in the 2 studies. NISP did 
not include thin blankets (as thin as 
or thinner than a receiving blanket) 
or sheets, whereas these items were 
included in our count.
Approximately 90% of infants had 
loose or soft bedding, including loose 
blankets, stuffed animals, pillows, 
bumper pads, and sleep positioners, 
in their sleep areas. Some of these 
items were found on shared sleep 
surfaces, which is not surprising. 
Adult beds frequently have parental 
bedding (eg, blankets, pillows); in 
addition, many parents who sleep 
with their infant use bedding to 
build a barrier in the belief that the 
bedding will protect the infant from 
falling off the bed or from rollover 
accidents. 
16 We also found that the 
majority of cribs contained soft or 
loose bedding. Many parents use 
soft bedding because of concerns 
about infant warmth and comfort, 
and to prevent infants from hurting 
themselves, and they may not be 
aware that soft bedding in the infant 
sleep environment creates a hazard. 
However, soft bedding in the sleep 
environment is the most common 
risk factor seen in sudden and 
unexpected infant deaths that occur 
in infants aged ≥4 months. 
15
There are 2 likely reasons that 
utilization of nocturnal videos 
resulted in the finding of higher 
rates of unsafe sleep environments 
than have been previously reported. 
First, objective video observations 
eliminate the bias inherent in 
self-reporting. Participants 
may be reluctant to admit to 
behaviors, particularly when they 
are inconsistent with infant care 
recommendations. In addition, videos 
allowed us to view the infant sleep 
environment throughout the entire 
night. This approach is in contrast 
to surveys, in which questions about 
sleep position, sleep location, and 
bedding are often asked in isolation, 
and the entire sleep environment 
may not be considered holistically. 
Furthermore, many parents may 
assume that the question refers only 
to initial placement at the beginning 
of the sleep period and not to 
changes occurring during the night. 
Indeed, we found that 28%, 18%, and 
12% of participating infants slept in 
>1 location during the night at 1, 3, 
and 6 months, respectively. When the 
infant was moved in the middle of the 
night, there was a higher likelihood 
that the infant was placed in an

unsafe sleep environment. We found 
that for all 3 observation times, the 
second sleep environment was more 
hazardous than the initial setting 
in terms of sleep location, sleep 
position, and sharing the surface with 
another person.
These findings have important 
implications for public health 
messaging regarding both initial 
placement and handling of the 
infant in the middle of the night. 
Although safe sleep messages have 
been emphasized for years, our 
data suggest that parents are not 
strictly adhering to the guidance on 
safe sleep environments. This lack 
of adherence may be at least partly 
because of persistent cultural norms 
and beliefs. For instance, decorative 
bedding products displayed at and 
sold in retail establishments (and 
shown in parenting magazines) 
have influenced what is seen as 
appropriate by parents. 
17 In addition, 
infant comfort, which includes longer 
sleep duration, is a priority for many 
parents, and this goal often results in 
prone and side positioning 
18 
 
 
 
 
 
–26 and 
sharing of sleep surfaces. 
27, 
 
28 Health 
care providers should be aware of 
these influences on parental decision-
making so that appropriate guidance 
can be given.
It is also important for health 
care providers to realize that the 
nighttime sleep environment is not 
static, but fluid, with potentially 
several changes during the course 
of the night. Kendall-Tackett et al 
29 
found that when parents were asked 
about infant sleep location at the 
beginning of the night, 31% reported 
bed-sharing, compared with 59% 
when parents were asked about 
sleep location at the end of the night. 
It is possible that well-intentioned 
parents consider safe sleep guidelines 
to be those that are applicable for 
the onset of sleep but less so in the 
middle of the night. It is therefore 
prudent for health care providers to 
ask about sleep environment for the 
entire night and provide anticipatory 
guidance accordingly. In addition, 
future epidemiologic studies should 
consider the fluid nature of the sleep 
environment.
We acknowledge that this study 
has limitations. Our cohort was 
largely white, with socioeconomic 
and educational levels higher 
than the norm. These results may 
therefore not be generalizable 
to other demographic groups. In 
addition, parents were aware that 
they were being videotaped. It is thus 
possible that we underestimated 
the proportion of families who did 
not adhere to safe sleep guidelines. 
Nonetheless, our direct observations 
revealed high rates of nonadherence 
with safe sleep guidelines. Future 
studies in other populations will be 
needed to confirm this.
CONCLUSIONS
This longitudinal study of infant 
sleep environments using videotaped 
observations found that among a 
predominantly highly educated, 
white population, infants were 
frequently placed in unsafe sleep 
environments, both with initial 
placement and during the course 
of the night. Our study found 
a higher proportion of sleep 
environment risk factors than 
have been reported in previous 
studies. Additional research on 
parental beliefs and understanding 
of when safe sleep guidelines 
are applicable and on barriers 
to safe sleep will be important, 
with the goal of developing more 
effective educational materials and 
interventions.
