Abstract
Background: Indications for intra-osseous (IO) infusion are increasing in adults requiring administration of fluids
and medications during initial resuscitation. However, this route is rarely used nowadays due to a lack of
knowlegde and training. We reviewed the current evidence for its use in adults requiring resuscitative procedures,
the contraindications of the technique, and modalities for catheter implementation and skill acquisition.
Methods: A PubMed search for all articles published up to December 2015 was performed by using the terms
“Intra-osseous” AND “Adult”. Additional articles were included by using the “related citations” feature of PubMed or
checking references of selected articles. Editorials, comments and case reports were excluded. Abstracts of all the
articles that the search yielded were independently screened for eligibility by two authors and included in the
analysis after mutual consensus. In total, 84 full-text articles were reviewed and 49 of these were useful for
answering the following question “when, how, and for which population should an IO infusion be used in adults”
were selected to prepare independent drafts. Once this step had been completed, all authors met, reviewed the
drafts together, resolved disagreements by consensus with all the authors, and decided on the final version.
Results: IO infusion should be implemented in all critical situations when peripheral venous access is not easily
obtainable. Contraindications are few and complications are uncommon, most of the time bound to prolonged
use. The IO infusion allows for blood sampling and administration of virtually all types of fluids and medications
including vasopressors, with a bioavailability close to the intravenous route. Unfortunately, IO infusion remains
underused in adults even though learning the technique is rapid and easy.
Conclusions: Indications for IO infusion use in adults requiring urgent parenteral access and having difficult
intravenous access are increasing. Physicians working in emergency departments or intensive care units should
learn the procedures for catheter insertion and maintenance, the contraindications of the technique, and the
possibilities this access offers.

Background
In patients experiencing shock, severe dehydration, car-
diac arrest, major trauma or airway compromise, and hav-
ing difficult peripheral intravenous (IV) access because of
edema, obesity, burns, medical history of IV drug abuse or
others, physicians have three choices to administer fluids
and medication during initial resuscitation: insertion of a
central venous catheter, insertion of an ultrasound-guided
peripheral venous catheter [1], or placement of an intra-
osseous (IO) device. In this setting, procedure for IO
infusion is shorter and has a higher success rate on
first attempt than other routes [2, 3]. Moreover, in
patients experiencing cardiac arrest, the procedure
does not require stopping cardiopulmonary resuscita-
tion and therefore may improve patient survival.
IO infusion is a rapid and safe method for obtaining
parenteral access in patients with difficult venous access.
Pioneered in 1922 by Drinker and colleagues [4], this ac-
cess was not used to benefit peripheral IV until the
1980s. Pediatricians have used this route for three de-
cades in frequent emergency situations like hypovolemic
shock in dehydrated infants. In adults, IO access is less
frequently used. However, it has been recommended for

 about 10 years in the case of failure of peripheral IV line
placement during resuscitation [5]. Unfortunately, physi-
cians do not frequently perform this procedure despite
the availability of new mechanical devices with high
success rate after brief training [6]. Yet, IO access is the
quickest way to establish access for rapid infusion of
fluids, drugs, and blood products in emergency situa-
tions as well as for cardiac resuscitation [7].
The aim of this systematic review is to summarize the
most relevant information on IO infusion in adults to
promote its use by physicians working in intensive care
units and emergency departments.
Methods
A PubMed search for all articles published up to December
2015 was performed by using the terms “Intra-osseous”
AND “Adult” (Title/Abstract), which returned 194 records
(Fig. 1). Retrieval was not limited in time, but only
manuscripts in English or French were selected. Edi-
torials, comments, and case reports were excluded.
Additional articles were included by using the “related
citations” feature of PubMed. The references of the
included articles were reviewed to ensure no relevant
articles had been missed. Finally, the most recent re-
views or guidelines on IO or peripheral IV infusion
were searched. In total, 25 more records were added.
Abstracts of the 219 articles that the search yielded
were reviewed independently by two authors (FP and
JG) and 135 of them out of scope of this review or
concerning only children were excluded. The same two
authors independently reviewed the full text of the
remaining 84 records to select those useful for answer-
ing the following question: when, how, and for which
population should an IO infusion be used in adults. Fi-
nally, a total of 49 records were retained by mutual con-
sensus, and pertinent data were extracted to prepare
independent drafts. Once this step had been completed,
all authors met, reviewed the drafts together, resolved
disagreements by consensus with all the authors, and de-
cided on the final version.
Results and Discussion
Historical background and recommendations for IO
access use
In 1922, Drinker described the marrow of a mammalian
bone as a “non-collapsible vein” [4]. In 1934, Josefson
used for the first time an IO access in humans via ster-
nal location to administer liver concentrate in patients
with pernicious anemia [8]. Then, in 1940, Tocantins
and O’Neill described successful administration of blood,
saline solutions and glucose using an IO access in
pediatric patients [9]. IO access was then forgotten by
physicians and reappeared in the 1980s for children only.
It took another two decades before recommendations
for IO access were included in the 2005 American Heart
Association guidelines for cardiopulmonary resuscitation
and emergency cardiovascular care for adults [10]. Their
last guidelines published in 2015 highlighted the place of
IO access when IV access is not readily available in
adults [5]. Moreover, it is pointed out that IO or IV drug

 administration should be preferred to endotracheal admin-
istration. Indeed, IO access allows for fluid resuscitation as
well as high-volume drugs with efficacy similar to an IV ac-
cess. By contrast, endotracheal administration allows only
specific drugs that have low toxicity to lung tissue, and
their bioavailability is more variable [5]. In trauma patients,
resuscitation often needs the administration of large vol-
ume of fluids. A large-caliber peripheral IV catheter may
be preferred, although its insertion may be more difficult.
Similarly, the tactical combat casualty care guidelines rec-
ommend the use of IO access when resuscitation is re-
quired and IV access is not easily obtainable [11]. In
extension, there is evidence that IO access should be used
in all adult trauma patients when an IV catheter is not
readily available, despite lack of randomized studies.
Despite these guidelines, IO access remains largely un-
derused. In the UK, only 7 % of 157 physicians working
in accident and emergency departments and seeing more
than 30,000 new patients per year used IO access in
2000, while 74 % were aware that it could be used in
adult patients [12]. More recently, in Denmark, 23.5 %
of 759 physicians responding to a questionnaire were
aware that they could use IO access in their practice, but
none of them did because of the lack of training and
equipment [13]. In 2009, in the United States, 72 % of na-
tional emergency medicine programs strongly recom-
mended the use of IO access in adult patients [14]. Despite
this recommendation, only 73 IO accesses were placed in
3847 unstable patients with unobtainable peripheral IV ac-
cess in the year prior to the survey. Sixty-two percent of
physicians who had failed in peripheral vascular access
chose central line access for the second attempt. If a third
attempt was required, central venous access remained the
predominant choice. IO access became the technique of
choice only if a fourth attempt was required.
Anatomy
When direct vascular access is difficult, the anatomical
characteristics of bone make IO access the most inter-
esting way for vascular access to start treatment of
shock. Indeed, the highly vascularized bone marrow is
connected to the central vascular system via the medul-
lary venous channel to nutrient and emissary veins. The
hardness of compact bone and the presence of bone
spicules where the marrow is contained make this cavity
a non-collapsible system even in the presence of shock or
profound hypovolemia [1]. Despite the fact the cavity is
empty after saline flush, bone spicules increase flow resist-
ance between bone cavity and vascular system. Therefore,
use of pressure bags is absolutely required to enhance flow
rates [15] and enable medications to reach the vascular
system. When this recommendation is implemented,
the IO access allows rapid delivery of large amounts
of fluids and medications in emergency situations.
Indications
In adults, IO access is required in emergency situations
as soon as peripheral access is not easily obtainable.
It can be used for drug administration, fluid perfusion
infusion, and to draw blood samples. The most fre-
quent clinical situations needing IO access in adult
patients remain cardiopulmonary resuscitation for epi-
nephrine administration [5], and trauma for the easi-
ness of access [16].
Contraindications
The main contraindications for IO access are summa-
rized in Table 1. As regards all vascular accesses, infec-
tion at insertion site should lead to the choice of an
alternative site to avoid spreading sepsis or osteitis. A
fractured bone leads directly to extravasation of fluids
and infused medications and thus to complete inefficacy
of IO access. In a general manner, IO access should not
be used in severe genetic or acquired bone diseases, im-
perfect osteogenesis, osteoporosis and osteomyelitis [17].
IO infusion devices
Manual and semi-automatic devices are available for IO
access. Manual devices require a specific needle with a
central removal stylet. The most commonly used devices
are the Dieckmann modified needle (Fig. 2) with two
opposing side ports at the tip to promote unobstructed
flow (Cook Medical Incorporation, Bloomington, IN,
USA) and the Jamshidi needle (Fig. 3) for bone marrow
biopsy (Cardinal Health, Dublin, OH, USA). These de-
vices are easier to use in young children than in adults.
Semi-automatic devices are preferred in adults despite
the lack of data proving their superiority. Three types of
devices are available. Two are disposable – the FAST1®
(Fig. 4) and since 2010 the FASTx® (Fig. 5) (Pyng
Medical
Corporation, Vancouver,
BC,
Canada)
for
sternal insertion only, and the Bone Injection Gun
(BIG®) (Fig. 6) (Waismed Limited, New York, NY,

 USA) – and one is re-disposable – the EZ-IO® (Fig. 7).
The latter is a power driver with sealed lithium bat-
teries enabling approximately 1000 insertions (EZ-IO®
Power Driver 9050) (Teleflex, Limerick, PA, USA) or
500 insertions for the newest and smaller version
(EZ-IO® G3 Power Driver 9058) without needing to
charge the batteries.
When a physician practices the manual IO access pro-
cedure, he/she has to ensure a safety guard on the nee-
dle of 1 cm with thumb-index and realize an axial
twisting motion to insert the needle in the bone. If the
needle is inserted with the FAST®, the insertion site is
located just below the sternal notch. The operator holds
the introducer perpendicular to the manubrium and
presses down until the needle is released. When BIG® is
used, the operator holds it firmly to avoid the projection
up of the needle perpendicular to the insertion site,
squeezes the safety latch and pushes to eject the needle

 in the bone. When the needle is inserted with EZ-IO®,
the operator drills the needle with the power driver into
the bone perpendicular to the insertion site.
Despite a large amount of literature on the subject,
there is no clear recommendation for one device over
another in a given situation. In fact, comparative studies
were conducted on cadaver models [18], very far from a
real emergency scene, where stress is a confounding
variable of performance. Furthermore, studies on pa-
tients are rarely prospective and include only a small
number of patients. In one recent randomized controlled
trial study comparing different devices in 107 adults, the
success rate on first attempt was higher (92 % vs 83 %,
p = 0.02) with BIG® than with EZIO® [19]. In a retro-
spective study of 47 IO insertions in adults between
2003 and 2010 [20], use of EZIO® was associated with
higher success rate on first attempt (96 % vs 56 % or
40 %, respectively; p < 0.01) and higher overall success
rate (96 % vs 55 % or 50 %, respectively; p < 0.01) com-
pared with BIG® or manual needle. Several studies
highlighted that the stylet could stick within the cannula
when BIG® was used [21, 22].
Insertion of IO devices
The procedure of IO access must be performed under
sterile conditions using sterile gloves, a large sterile
drape and a disposable sterile needle, after cleaning
the skin to avoid causing osteomyelitis or cellulitis.
There is no study comparing one antiseptic with an-
other. In analogy with recommendations for vascular
access [23, 24] or preoperative skin preparation [25],
2 % alcoholic chlorhexidine should be used in the
absence of contraindications.
Different insertion sites have been evaluated, and to be
safe, the following characteristics are required: a rela-
tively thin cortical bone, a large medullary cavity, a flat
surface, easy anatomical landmarks to avoid misplace-
ment, and an easy access whatever the care provided to
the patient. Three insertion sites meet these criteria in
adults [26]: the proximal tibia, the distal tibia, and the
proximal humerus. The sternal location has also been
proposed, but the relatively thin medullary cavity leads
to the risk of passing through the bone to the aorta and
the heart [27]. Moreover, in the setting of anesthesia, in-
tensive care, or emergency medicine, IO accesses are
mainly used during CPR, excluding this route [26] until
now. New devices for sternal use are being commercial-
ized and will be tested [18].
The proximal tibial insertion site is located 2 cm below
the tibial tuberosity, and 1 to 2 cm medial in the middle
of the flat surface of the bone (Additional file 1). The
distal tibial insertion site is located 2 cm superior to the
medial malleolus in the middle of the flat surface of the
bone (Additional file 2). The proximal humerus insertion
site is located in the greater tubercle toward the coracoid
process (Additional file 3). For this latter route, the arm
should be flexed and internally rotated. The needle
should not be inserted internally to the greater tubercle
(in the sulcus intertubercularis) to avoid lesion to the
tendon of biceps brachii.
Both the proximal tibia and the proximal humerus
have high insertion success rates. The tibial location has
the additional benefit of being easily affordable, even in
obese patients, and of being far from the head and chest,
reducing the risk of needle dislodgment during resusci-
tation and management of airway [28]. In a randomized
controlled trial of 182 adult patients experiencing a

 nontraumatic out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, in which re-
suscitation efforts were initiated by trained paramedics,
the first-attempt success rate was higher (p < 0.001) with
tibial access (91 %, 95 % confidence interval [95 % CI]:
83–98 %) compared with either humeral access (51 %,
95 % CI: 37–65 %) or peripheral IV access (43 %, 95 %
CI: 31–55 %) [6]. Median time for vascular access was
shorter (p < 0.001) for individuals assigned to the tib-
ial access group (4.6 min, interquartile range [IQR]:
3.6–6.2 min) compared with those assigned to the hu-
meral access group (7.0 min, IQR: 3.9–10.0 min), and
neither time was significantly different from that of
the peripheral IV group (5.8 min, IQR: 4.1–8.0 min).
Subsequent dislodgment was observed in 5 % (95 %
CI: 0–10 %) of participants in the tibial access group
compared with 20 % (95 % CI: 8–31 %) in the hu-
meral access group and 6 % (95 % CI: 0–12 %) in the
peripheral IV access group (p = ns). When humeral ac-
cess is chosen, use of a 45-mm-long catheter increases the
first-attempt success rate and immobilization of the af-
fected arm by a strap decreases the occurrence of subse-
quent dislodgement [29].
Despite a lack of evidence-based medicine, adminis-
tration of lidocaine in the medullary cavity has been
proposed in conscious patients before injecting other
drugs or fluids. Indeed, if the needle insertion is not
painful, some authors describe worthier pain related
to fluid administration than from traumatic injuries
[30]. Yet, half of the patients receiving 20–40 mg
lidocaine complain of pain during subsequent drug or
fluid administration [31].
Confirmation of correct IO device placement
Correct placement of the IO needle is confirmed by the
presence of the five following signs (Table 2): sudden
loss of resistance on entering the marrow cavity, ability
of the needle to remain upright without support,
bone marrow or blood easily sampled using a syringe,
administration of 2 mL of saline without subcutane-
ous tissue swelling, and easy administration of fluids
without resistance [6].
Utility of IO access
The IO access can be used to draw blood samples. In
hemodynamically stable patients, just after the IO needle
is placed sodium, magnesium, calcium, lactate, glucose,
blood gases (pH and PCO2), and hemoglobin values are
similar between IO and IV accesses. Accuracy for po-
tassium
is
lower
but
differences
remained
within
25 % [32, 33]. In patients with cardiac arrest, drawing
blood samples is more difficult and may lead to
wrong values due to low flow state and stasis in the
bone. Above all, when IO access is used to infuse
drugs or fluids, IO blood samples cannot be inter-
preted due to the dilutional effect of infused drugs
and fluids. To summarize, blood samples may be ob-
tained only in patients with spontaneous cardiac ac-
tivity or during initial cardiopulmonary resuscitation
before IO drug and fluid infusion [34, 35].
The IO access allows rapid fluid administration to pro-
vide the required volume resuscitation in patients in
shock. The IO flow rate may reach up to 150 mL/min in
either the tibial or humeral route when the pressure bag
is inflated up to 300 mm Hg [36]. However, flow rates
20-fold lower have been reported with the tibial access
in patients with cardiac arrest and receiving IV infusion
in the homolateral femoral vein [37]. A competitive flow
rate and cardiac arrest may explain these observations.
Different flow rates reached with IO access according to
insertion site are summarized in Table 3.
Pharmacokinetics of drugs after IO administration
A variety of drugs have been delivered safely through IO
access (Table 4). Theoretically, any medication that can
be introduced intravenously can be introduced via an IO
access. The most interesting medications during shock
resuscitation are vasoactive drugs. Each drug administra-
tion should be flushed with 10 mL of fluid to rule out
drug persistence in the medullar cavity [38].
In a swine model of cardiac arrest, peak arterial blood
concentrations of two different dye tracers were achieved
faster (p < 0.05) for sternal IO access (53 sec) than tibial

 IO access (107 sec) administration during cardiopulmo-
nary resuscitation. Moreover, delivered tibial IO dose was
65 % of sternal dose. Time to peak blood concentration
and total delivered dose were similar for sternal IO and
central venous administration [39]. In a recent study with
a porcine septic shock model, the concentration of antibi-
otics was similar between IO access and peripheral IV ac-
cess [40]. In the sole study in adults, pharmacokinetic
parameters were similar after IO or IV administration of a
single 5 mg bolus of morphine sulfate using IO access im-
planted in iliac crest [41].
Securing the IO access
To avoid misplacement due to resuscitation or inadvert-
ent movements, the IO needle and its tubing need to be
secured even if the needle stands on its own in the cor-
tical layer. Specific adhesive tape commercialized by the
devices’ manufacturers can be used (Fig. 8). Some clini-
cians prefer not to occlude the puncture site by an adhe-
sive tape, because if dislodgment of the needle occurs, it
will be the first place to see the subcutaneous swelling.
At any rate, in both cases, the tubing must be secured
with at least two omental tapes on the limb where the
needle is inserted. Physicians have to make sure there is
no extravasation of fluid before setting up the tape.
Complications
Besides the inability to insert the needle or a subsequent
displacement, complications of IO insertion are uncom-
mon, lower than 1 % of insertions. Compartment syn-
drome due to extravasation of fluid is the most common
complication. If the needle has been inserted without
complications, there are no significant differences in ex-
travasation rates between gravity and 300 mmHg pres-
sure infusions [42]. Other serious complications include
osteomyelitis, cellulitis, and skin abscesses, and all linked
to prolonged IO access use [43]. Thus, the use of IO ac-
cess should be limited to a few hours until IV access is
achieved without exceeding 24 hours. The most serious
complication leading to death was seen with sternal ac-
cess. It was due to lesions to the heart or aorta and med-
iastinitis before specific devices for sternal puncture
were available [44]. Even though microscopic pulmonary
fat and marrow emboli were found in the autopsy of ani-
mals after use of IO needle insertion, fat emboli were
also found in the lungs of animals with cardiopulmonary
resuscitation without IO access [45]. Probably, because
of the confounding factors due to the clinical situation
requiring IO use, no article reports a direct involvement
of IO perfusion in fat emboli syndrome in humans.
Removing the IO device
A sterile luer lock syringe can be connected to the hub
of the needle to make the hold easier. Then, with a
clockwise pulling rotation, the needle can be removed
and a sterile dressing applied on the puncture site, in
analogy with recommendations for vascular access.
Skill acquisition
IO access is an emergency procedure relatively easy to
learn. If success rate is low for novices who have previ-
ously attended a lecture (37.5 %) without practical train-
ing, when a manual needle is used [46], it increases from
65 to 97 % when physicians use semiautomatic devices
[31, 47]. After training, including a 60-min lecture

when a manual device was used, physicians could

procedure assessment scale, previously validated [46],
as a learning assessment tool.
In a recent study with 759 responders to a question-
naire about the nonuse of IO access when it was neces-
sary, the main reasons for not using were lack of
equipment and lack of training [13].
Conclusions
The use of IO infusion, which was initially reserved for
children, is increasing in adults, and is an alternative
choice for vascular access in emergency situations today.
Besides the patient in cardiac arrest, IO access is usable
for patients with trauma, shock and, more globally, for
every patient requiring emergency parenteral access and
having difficult IV access. The contraindications are
limited in number and offset by the different insertion
sites available. The technique of insertion can be easily
learned with high success rates after a brief training
course. The IO access is therefore an indispensable tool
for physicians caring for patients in life-threatening
situations.
