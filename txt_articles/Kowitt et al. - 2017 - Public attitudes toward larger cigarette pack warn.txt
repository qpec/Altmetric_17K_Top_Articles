Abstract
A large body of evidence supports the effectiveness of larger health warnings on cigarette
packages. However, there is limited research examining attitudes toward such warning
labels, which has potential implications for implementation of larger warning labels. The pur-
pose of the current study was to examine attitudes toward larger warning sizes on cigarette
packages and examine variables associated with more favorable attitudes. In a nationally
representative survey of U.S. adults (N = 5,014), participants were randomized to different
warning size conditions, assessing attitude toward “a health warning that covered (25, 50,
75) % of a cigarette pack.” SAS logistic regression survey procedures were used to account
for the complex survey design and sampling weights. Across experimental groups, nearly
three-quarters (72%) of adults had attitudes supportive of larger warning labels on cigarette
packs. Among the full sample and smokers only (N = 1,511), most adults had favorable atti-
tudes toward labels that covered 25% (78.2% and 75.2%, respectively), 50% (70% and
58.4%, respectively), and 75% (67.9% and 61%, respectively) of a cigarette pack. Young
adults, females, racial/ethnic minorities, and non-smokers were more likely to have favor-
able attitudes toward larger warning sizes. Among smokers only, females and those with
higher quit intentions held more favorable attitudes toward larger warning sizes. Widespread
support exists for larger warning labels on cigarette packages among U.S. adults, including
among smokers. Our findings support the implementation of larger health warnings on ciga-
rette packs in the U.S. as required by the 2009 Tobacco Control Act.
Introduction
While tobacco use is the leading cause of preventable death and disease in the United States
[1], of the 40 million adults that currently smoke cigarettes [2], the vast majority want to quit

Funding: Research reported in this publication was
supported by grant number P50 CA180907 from
the National Cancer Institute and the FDA Center
for Tobacco Products (CTP). The content is solely
the responsibility of the authors and does not
 [3]. One way to increase quit attempts and stimulate smoking cessation may be through health
warnings on tobacco products. Because of the frequency with which warning labels are seen by
current smokers and their extensive reach to diverse populations, the Institute of Medicine has
concluded that prominent health warnings on cigarette packages are “among the most cost-
effective forms of public health education available” [4]. In fact, a pack-a-day smoker could
potentially be exposed to warning labels over 7,000 times in one year [5], and that exposure
may coincide precisely with when a smoker is reaching for a cigarette.
While health warning labels have been required for cigarette packs in the U.S. since 1965,
the current health warning labels on packs in the U.S. are largely ineffective, given that they
have not been changed for over 30 years (since 1985) [6]. Moreover, the four text-only
required warnings are small (around 10% of the package), only appear on the side of packs,
and often go unnoticed by current smokers [6]. The 2009 Family Smoking Prevention and
Tobacco Control Act required the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to implement
graphic (pictorial) warning labels covering 50% of the front and rear panels of the cigarette
package, and similar warnings are required for cigarette advertising at 20% of the advertise-
ment’s area [6, 7]. These larger warning labels have not yet been implemented due to industry
litigation that has temporarily halted their implementation [7]. In fact, the final rule was chal-
lenged in court and on August 24th, 2012, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Colum-
bia Circuit struck down the specific graphic warnings proposed by the FDA, although the size
of the required warnings was not challenged [6, 7]. Currently, the FDA is conducting research
on new graphic warnings that “aims to support a new rulemaking consistent with the Tobacco
Control Act” [7]. Given the delay, eight public health and medical groups filed a lawsuit on
October 4, 2016 to force the FDA to issue a final ruling regarding health warnings on cigarette
packages [8].
The effectiveness of health warnings on cigarette packs depends on many variables (e.g.,
content, placement on pack, presence or absence of pictorial, static vs. rotating messages)—
one of which is size. Article 11 of the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC), a
treaty adopted by the World Health Organization to develop universal standards for tobacco
control, emphasized the importance of warnings that cover at least 30% of the area of the two
principal display panels [9]. The FCTC also noted the effectiveness of larger health warnings,
covering more than 50% of the principal display areas, and urged parties to consider larger
warnings [9]. These recommendations for larger health warnings have been supported with
evidence from a recent review noting the effectiveness of larger health warnings [10] and eval-
uations of countries that have implemented larger health warnings [5, 11, 12]. Moreover,
recent meta-analyses of warning experiments [13] and observational studies [14, 15] have
demonstrated a greater impact of pictorial as compared to text-only warnings on a series of
cessation-related outcomes; such warnings are virtually always larger and more visible on the
cigarette pack.
In Canada, researchers estimated that new warning labels introduced in 2001 (which
included implementation of pictorial warnings and increased size from 35 to 50%) decreased
adult smoking prevalence between 12 and 20% by 2009 [11]. The authors estimated that if sim-
ilar warning labels had been implemented in the U.S. in 2012, the number of adult smokers
would have been reduced by 5.3 to 8.6 million adults in 2013 [11]. Similarly, a recent analysis
estimated that larger pictorial warning labels (covering 50% of the front and back of cigarette
packs) in the U.S. could reduce smoking prevalence by 5% over the short term and 10% over
the long term. This change would help avert over 650,000 smoking-attributable deaths in the
next 50 years, in addition to fewer low-birth weight cases, preterm births, and cases of sudden
infant death syndrome [16].

Competing interests: The authors have declared
that no competing interests exist.
 Evidence from other countries also suggests the importance of warning label size in reduc-
ing smoking prevalence and increasing quit intentions. When Uruguay increased the size of
their graphic warning labels from 50% to 80%, all warning label effectiveness metrics signifi-
cantly increased (i.e., salience of the warning labels, frequency of thinking about smoking-
related harms and quitting, and foregoing cigarettes) [12]. Similarly, in Australia, evaluations
of their 2012 implementation of larger, graphic warning labels and plain packs found that the
new warnings decreased the appeal of tobacco and cigarette packs among adults [17] and ado-
lescents [18], and increased quit attempts among smokers [19]. It is therefore likely that
increasing the size of pack warnings may be an independent factor in warning label effective-
ness [10].
Previous research has examined the effectiveness of warning label size on smoking-related
outcomes, concluding that larger warning sizes are associated with increased knowledge of
smoking risks and harms, increased quit intentions and attempts, and potentially decreased
smoking prevalence [4–6, 10, 11, 14, 20]. Little research, however, has examined public atti-
tudes toward different sizes of warning labels on cigarette packages. Favorable attitudes toward
larger pack warning sizes may facilitate policy adoption, which is critical given that larger
warnings will only be impactful if they can actually be adopted and implemented. Data on atti-
tudes may also influence what warning size policy-makers will ultimately support, influence
policy effectiveness, and identify hard-to-change sub-populations for whom targeted messages
or public service announcements may be necessary [21–24]. As one example of the importance
of policy support (or lack thereof), part of the failure of the 1998 U.S. Senate tobacco legislation
(the “National Tobacco Policy and Youth Smoking Reduction Act”) can be attributed to a lack
of broad public support [25]. If research had been conducted examining public attitudes
toward the legislation, the findings would have suggested that the public preferred some mea-
sures (i.e., youth access restrictions), but not others, and that incremental changes would have
been more successful [26]. More recently, when seeking to raise the minimum age to purchase
tobacco and “Sensible Tobacco Enforcement”, New York City relied on several strategies to
build a broad spectrum of public support (particularly among constituents who were previ-
ously unsupportive) [27].
Given the importance of efforts to increase the size of cigarette warnings in the U.S., com-
bined with the lack of research about attitudes towards increased sizes, the purpose of our
study was to investigate attitudes of U.S. adults toward larger warning sizes on cigarette
packages.
Methods
Data source
Data utilized in this research come from a nationally representative telephone survey adminis-
tered by the Center for Regulatory Research on Tobacco Communication (CRRTC) between
September 15, 2014 and May 31, 2015 [28]. The CRRTC phone survey included questions on
tobacco regulatory constructs, including tobacco product use and public support for tobacco
regulations. Two independent and non-overlapping random digit-dialing frames (landline
and cell) were used for sampling, ensuring coverage to approximately 98% of U.S. households.
In order to ensure adequate representation among smokers, high-smoking/low-income areas
were oversampled. Additionally, cell phone numbers were oversampled to maximize counts of
young adults. To be eligible for participation, a telephone number needed to reach a household
with an English- or Spanish-speaking resident 18 years of age or older. The sample resulted in
5,014 interviews and a weighted response rate of 42%, which is comparable to other national
tobacco surveys [29, 30]. Participation was voluntary and anonymous; informed oral consent

 was obtained by all participants prior to enrollment in the study. The UNC Chapel Hill Institu-
tional Review Board approved all study procedures including consent procedures. More details
on the sampling and data collection procedures can be found elsewhere [28].
Experimental data
Participants were asked for their attitude toward health warnings of a particular size on ciga-
rette packs. The exact item was: “do you think that the FDA should have a health warning that
covers (randomized) % of a cigarette pack?”. One-third of participants were randomized to
receive a message that the health warning covers 25% of a cigarette pack, one-third to 50%,
and one-third to 75%. Participants were not exposed to actual warnings on cigarette packs but
rather were asked their attitude towards warnings of different sizes over the phone. Responses
included yes (coded as 1) or no (coded as 0). Participants who refused to answer, reported “do
not know”, or reported “no opinion” were characterized as missing and excluded from analysis
(n = 238, 4.4% of the sample).
Measures
Demographic characteristics.
Demographic characteristics measured included age, sex,
race, ethnicity, education, and household poverty status. Age was dichotomized for analyses
with categories for young adults (18–24 years old) and adults (25+ years old). We used census
categories to define race, which included: White; Black or African American; or other race
(including American Indian or Alaska Native; Asian; Pacific Islander; and other). Education
was measured with categories for high school or less; and greater than a high school. House-
hold poverty status was classified as above or below the 2014 poverty line based on household
size and income reported by participants.
Additional tobacco covariates.
Additional tobacco covariates used in our study included
current smoking status and quit intentions. Current smoking status was measured with two
items, asking participants “have you smoked at least 100 cigarettes in your entire life?” and “do
you now smoke cigarettes every day, some days, or not at all?” [31]. Participants who reported
smoking at least 100 lifetime cigarettes and reported now smoking cigarettes every day or
some days were classified as current smokers. Otherwise, participants were classified as not
current smokers. Quit intentions were measured with the item “are you planning to quit
smoking. . .” with response options for “within the next month” (coded as 1), “within the next
6 months” (coded as 2), “sometime in the future beyond 6 months” (coded as 3), or “are you
not planning to quit” (coded as 4) [32]. This item was only asked of current smokers. For anal-
ysis, we reverse coded this item so that the scale of quit intentions ranged from 1–4, where 4
indicates higher quit intentions.
Data analysis
We used SAS version 9.3 survey procedures to account for the complex survey design and
sampling weights [33]. We entered all covariates (i.e., race, ethnicity, age, sex, education,
household poverty status, smoking status, quit intentions) and the warning size manipulation
simultaneously in a multivariable logistic regression model to estimate odds ratios (ORs) for
adults with attitudes supportive of larger health warnings. Additionally, we stratified results by
experimental condition to determine variables related to favorable attitudes of different warn-
ing sizes, i.e., 25%, 50%, and 75%, and by smoking status to determine variables related to
favorable attitudes among current smokers. Only individuals with complete data across all rel-
evant variables were included in the analyses. In our final model for the entire sample, 287
observations (approximately 5.7% of the sample) were deleted because they were missing on

 some of the explanatory variables. Results include weighted percentages (which adjust for the
sampling design, nonresponse rates, and population counts with regards to census region, age,
education, gender, ethnicity, phone type, and regional smoking rates) [28], adjusted odds
ratios (AOR), and confidence intervals (CI) and may be generalized to all adults in the United
States. For all analyses, significance was set at p < 0.05.
Results
Participant characteristics
Table 1 provides weighted percentages for our sample (N = 5,014). The sample was approxi-
mately half female (51.5%); majority over the age of 25 (85.1%); and majority White (68%),
non-Latino (85.8%). Participants were educated (57.4% with some college or higher) and
mostly above the poverty line (75.3%). Approximately one sixth of participants reported being
a current smoker (17.8%) and among current smokers, mean quit intentions were 2.52 (stan-
dard error: 0.05) on a scale of 1–4, where 4 indicates higher intentions.
Table 2 shows the weighted logistic regression results. Overall, across experimental groups,
nearly three-quarters (72%) of adults held favorable attitudes toward all larger cigarette health
warnings, including favorable attitudes toward the 25% warning condition (78.2%), the 50%
condition (70%) and the 75% condition (67.9%). There were no significant differences in pro-
portion of adults who were in favor of the 75% health warning size vs. the 50% health warning
size (AOR: 0.90; 95% CI: 0.66, 1.22; data not shown). Individuals randomized to receive the
50% and 75% health warning label conditions had lower odds of favorable attitudes than indi-
viduals randomized to receive the 25% warning label condition (AOR: 0.62; 95% CI: 0.45, 0.84
and AOR: 0.55; 95% CI: 0.42, 0.74, respectively). Males (AOR: 0.65; 95% CI: 0.50, 0.84) and
current smokers (AOR: 0.60; 95% CI: 0.45, 0.80) had lower odds of having favorable to larger
warnings, regardless of size, than females and non-smokers. Young adults (AOR: 2.25; 95% CI:
1.57, 3.21), African Americans (AOR: 3.13; 95% CI: 2.02, 4.85), individuals of “other” race
(AOR: 1.87, 95% CI: 1.27, 2.75), and Latinos (AOR: 2.17, 99% CI: 1.42, 3.34) had higher odds
of having favorable attitudes supportive of larger health warning labels, regardless of size, com-
pared to adults over the age of 25 and White, non-Latino respondents.
Among current smokers, the majority of adult smokers reported having a favorable attitude
to larger warning label sizes, including favorable attitudes toward the 25% (75.2%), 50%
(58.4%) and 75% sizes (61%). Smokers who were African American (AOR: 4.31; 95% CI: 2.28,
8.16), were Latino (AOR: 3.03, 95% CI: 1.17, 7.84), had a high school degree or less (AOR:
1.74, 95% CI: 1.05, 2.89), and had increasing quit intentions (AOR: 1.65, 95% CI: 1.27, 2.14)
had higher odds of favorable attitudes to larger health warning labels, regardless of size, com-
pared to White non-Latino smokers, and smokers with greater than a high school degree.
After adjusting for covariates, adult smokers randomized to receive the 50% and 75% health
warning label conditions had lower odds of having favorable attitudes to larger warnings than
smokers randomized to receive the 25% health warning label condition (AOR: 0.34; 95% CI:
0.19, 0.60 and AOR: 0.46; 95% CI: 0.26, 0.82, respectively).
Stratified by experimental condition
We stratified results by experimental condition to determine variables related to favorable atti-
tudes of each of the warning sizes (Table 3 for the entire sample and Table 4 for smokers only).
Among the entire sample, males in the 25% and 50% health warning size conditions had lower
odds of having favorable attitudes to larger warning labels than females (AOR: 0.56; 95% CI:
0.36, 0.88 and AOR: AOR: 0.61; 95% CI: 0.38, 0.97, respectively). Young adults in the 25% and
75% health warning size conditions had higher odds of favorable attitudes to larger warning

 labels than adults over the age of 25 (AOR: 4.59; 95% CI: 2.18, 9.65 and AOR: 1.76; 95% CI:
1.03, 3.00, respectively). Across all three warning label conditions, African Americans had
higher odds of favorable attitudes to larger warning labels than White adults (AOR: 5.00; 95%
CI: 2.78, 8.97, AOR: 2.88; 95% CI: 1.19, 6.98, and AOR: 2.65; 95% CI: 1.57, 4.48, respectively).
Finally, Latinos in the 25% and 50% health warning size conditions had higher odds of having
favorable attitudes to larger warning labels than non-Latino adults (AOR: 3.20; 95% CI: 1.50,
6.85 and AOR: 2.44; 95% CI: 1.05, 5.68, respectively).
Among smokers only (Table 4), individuals with increasing quit intentions in the 25% and
50% cigarette health warning size conditions had higher odds of having favorable attitudes to
larger warning labels (AOR: 1.69; 95% CI: 1.12, 2.54 and AOR: 1.60; 95% CI: 1.13, 2.26, respec-
tively). Smokers whose household income fell below the poverty line in the 25% had lower
odds of having favorable attitudes to larger warning labels than smokers whose income fell
above the poverty line (AOR: 0.34, 95% CI: 0.15, 0.78); whereas smokers whose household
income fell below the poverty line in the 75% condition had higher odds of having favorable
attitudes supportive of larger cigarette warning labels (AOR: 6.74, 95% CI: 2.48, 18.28). Finally,
young adults, African Americans, and Latinos in the 50% cigarette warning size conditions
had higher odds of having favorable attitudes to larger warning labels than adults over the age
of 25 and White, non-Latino adults (AOR: 2.69, 95% CI: 1.07, 6.73, AOR: 14.05; 95% CI: 5.97,
33.06 and AOR: 6.20; 95% CI: 1.76, 21.83, respectively).

 Discussion
Results from our study indicate that the majority of U.S. adults—including smokers—have
favorable attitudes toward larger health warning labels on cigarette packs. Indeed, it is notable
that nearly three-quarters (72%) of adults had favorable attitudes toward warning labels as
large as 75% of a cigarette pack, and even larger percentages of adults had favorable attitudes
toward warning labels covering at least 50% of a cigarette pack. Additionally, we found that
young adults, racial / ethnic minorities, and non-smokers were more likely to have attitudes in

 favor of larger warning sizes, whereas among smokers only, males and those with lower quit
intentions were less likely to have attitudes in favor of larger sizes. These results are consistent
with a recent study that examined attitudes about graphic warnings among US adults [34].
As of 2014, more than 134 countries or jurisdictions have required cigarette health warning
labels to cover at least 30% of the package, and over 60 countries or jurisdictions have required
cigarette health warning labels to cover at least 50% of the cigarette package. Moreover, 6
countries (Thailand, Australia, Uruguay, Brunei, Canada, and Nepal) have required cigarette
health warning labels to cover 75% or more of the cigarette package [35]. The Tobacco Control
Act of 2009 required pictorial warning labels to cover 50% of the front and rear panels of

 cigarette packages in the U.S. [7]. In the 2010 and 2011 proposed and final rulings regarding
this 50% requirement, the FDA cited extensive evidence in support of this size requirement,
including FCTC recommendations, evaluations of countries that have implemented larger
health warnings (e.g., Canada, New Zealand, Australia), and experiments manipulating the
size of warning labels [36, 37]. However, as of 2014, the U.S. was one of 50 countries that had
not implemented pictorial warnings and larger warnings on the front or back of cigarette
packages [35], and that remains the case today in 2017.
Our study suggests that if the provision for larger warning labels on cigarette packages is
implemented as required by federal law, there would be widespread support among the Ameri-
can public, including among smokers who would be most affected by the new warnings [38].
The extent of favorable attitudes toward warnings that we observed are consistent with, if not
higher than, attitudes for other tobacco control policies. For instance, Rose et al. examined
national attitudes for enacted and potential point-of-sale tobacco control policies and found

 moderate to poor levels of support (less than 50%) for a variety of point-of-sale policies, such
as advertising restrictions, product bans, and promotion restrictions [39]. Thus, compared to
other tobacco control policies that have been proposed or implemented, our study demon-
strates strong support. The findings about smokers (i.e., 61% of smokers showing favorable
attitudes toward a warning label of 75% size) is particularly important given that it is substan-
tially higher than levels of favorable attitudes found among smokers for a variety of other
tobacco control policies [39], and smokers are usually more opposed to tobacco control poli-
cies than non-smokers [39–41].
Research from public policy and agenda setting theory suggests that public attitudes are an
important factor in policy adoption, implementation, and effectiveness [23, 24]. Indeed, there
are several examples from tobacco regulatory science in which public attitudes were influential
in enacting tobacco control policies at the state [42] and federal level [25]. For instance, policy-
makers may be more likely to vote for tobacco control legislation if they perceive constituent
support for the proposed legislation [22]. Research also suggests that public attitudes may play
a role in policy effectiveness. For instance, in a study of attitudes toward anti-tobacco policy
among California youth, favorable attitudes were associated with advocacy behaviors, such as
asking someone not to smoke [21]. Furthermore, reactance theory suggests that if individuals
perceive certain policies to be too restrictive or limiting of personal autonomy, they may
respond by (at best) ignoring such policies or (at worst) adopting an opposing attitude, and
research finds that reactance may indeed reduce the effectiveness of pictorial warnings [43].
While our study provides evidence that the majority of Americans have favorable attitudes
toward larger cigarette health warnings, future research (both qualitative and quantitative)
could be particularly useful in examining reasons why individuals may or may not favor larger
warning sizes and the effects of implementing larger warning sizes among smokers who are
and are not in favor of such changes.
No significant differences existed between levels of support for warning labels that cover
50% of the cigarette pack and those that cover 75% of the cigarette pack. This finding is impor-
tant given that a growing body of research has established that warning label effectiveness may
increase with size and that warning labels that cover 75% of a cigarette pack or greater may be
more impactful than those that only cover 50%. For instance, in Canada, researchers found
that increasing the size of pictorial warnings on cigarette packages from 50% to 75%, 90%, and
100% enhanced their effectiveness among adult smokers, youth smokers, and vulnerable
youth non-smokers [44, 45]. Although the 2009 Tobacco Control Act required warning labels
to cover at least 50% of a cigarette package, the FDA has regulatory authority to increase the
size of warning labels to higher levels. Since public health benefits may increase with warning
label size and U.S. adults may equally support larger warning labels, future tobacco control
policy in the U.S. may consider implementation of warning labels of 75% size. As research sug-
gests that each major strengthening of warning labels increases their effectiveness, after imple-
menting warnings that are 50% for a period of time, further increasing the size to 75% should
have additional impact [14, 15].
Lastly, we found favorable attitudes for larger warning sizes to mirror some demographic
findings for other tobacco control policies. Specifically, we found women, young adults, racial
/ ethnic minorities (i.e., African Americans and Latinos), and non-smokers to be more in
favor of larger warning labels, as has been documented for other policies [39–41]. Given that
the prevalence of current smoking is higher among young adults and racial / ethnic minorities,
the fact that our study observed more favorable attitudes among these demographics is notable
[46]. It is possible that since young adults and racial / ethnic minorities have lower quit rates
(i.e., they are less successful in quitting smoking) [46], they would be more likely to favor
tobacco control efforts, such as larger warning sizes, that would benefit future quit attempts.

 While smokers were overall less likely to view larger health warnings favorably, we found
that several sub-groups of smokers (racial / ethnic minorities, individuals with higher quit
intentions, individuals with a high school degree or less) were more supportive of larger health
warnings, a finding consistent with previous research on public opinion of tobacco control
policies [39] and one study of graphic warnings in the U.S. [34]. Contrary to some research
that suggests that older adults may be more supportive of tobacco control policies and conflict-
ing evidence regarding the role of education and SES [39], we found young adults to be more
in favor of larger warning sizes and little consistent relationship between education and sup-
port for larger warning labels.
Limitations
Our study had several limitations. First, participants heard about potentially larger cigarette
pack warnings, rather than actually seeing the warnings, which could have influenced attitudes
toward the cigarette warnings. Second, our experiment did not inform participants whether
the pack warnings would be text-only or pictorial/graphic and where they would appear on the
pack. Third, we did not inform participants about the size or placement requirements for cur-
rent cigarette pack warnings. Fourth, our study only assessed one aspect (i.e., size) of the
Tobacco Control Act warning label requirements. Future research may also examine size in
addition to the requirement for pictorial warning labels. Last, some of the estimates in the
models stratified by warning size condition and/or smoking status were unstable due to small
cell counts. Despite these limitations, our study provides nationally representative data largely
illustrating positive public attitudes toward larger health warning labels on cigarette packages.
Conclusions
Our study demonstrated that the majority of U.S. adults view large warning labels on cigarette
packages favorably, with over two-thirds favoring warning labels that cover 75% of a cigarette
pack and increasing support for warning labels that cover 50%. Additionally, we found that
young adults, African Americans, individuals classified as low poverty status, and smokers
intending to quit were more likely to hold favorable attitudes toward larger warning sizes,
whereas males and current smokers (including those not intending to quit) were less likely to
hold favorable attitudes toward larger warning sizes. Tobacco control policies in support of
larger warning labels are likely to be strongly supported by the American public. Future
research may be particularly useful in explaining why individuals may be in favor of these
larger warning sizes and the influence of such attitudes on responses to warnings and cessa-
tion-related behavioral changes.
