Abstract
Background: Heat therapy has been suggested to improve cardiovascular function. However, the effects of hot sauna
exposure on arterial compliance and the dynamics of blood flow and pressure have not been well documented. Thus, we
investigated the short-term effects of sauna bathing on arterial stiffness and haemodynamics.
Design: The design was an experimental non-randomised study.
Methods: There were 102 asymptomatic participants (mean age, 51.9 years) who had at least one cardiovascular risk
factor. Participants were exposed to a single sauna session (duration: 30 min; temperature: 73�C; humidity: 10–20%).
Pulse wave velocity, augmentation index, heart rate, blood pressure, mean arterial pressure, pulse pressure, augmented
pressure and left ventricular ejection time were assessed before, immediately after, and 30 min after a single sauna
session.
Results: Sauna bathing led to reductions in pulse wave velocity, blood pressure, mean arterial pressure and left ven-
tricular ejection time. Mean pulse wave velocity value before sauna was 9.8 m/s and decreased to 8.6 m/s immediately
after sauna bathing (p < 0.001 for difference), and was 9.0 m/s after the 30-minute recovery period (p < 0.001 for analysis
of variance). Systolic blood pressure was 137 mm Hg before sauna bathing, decreasing to 130 mm Hg after sauna
(p < 0.001), which remained sustained during the 30-minute recovery phase (p < 0.001 for analysis of variance). After
a single sauna session, diastolic blood pressure decreased from 82 to 75 mm Hg, mean arterial pressure from 99.4 to
93.6 mm Hg and left ventricular ejection time from 307 to 278 m/s (p < 0.001 for all differences). Pulse pressure was
42.7 mm Hg before the sauna, 44.9 mm Hg immediately after the sauna, and reduced to 39.3 mm Hg after 30-minutes
recovery (p < 0.001 for analysis of variance). Heart rate increased from 65 to 81 beats/min post-sauna (p < 0.001); there
were no significant changes for augmented pressure and pulse pressure amplification.
Conclusion: This study shows that pulse wave velocity, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, mean arterial
pressure, left ventricular ejection time and diastolic time decreased immediately after a 30-minute sauna session.
Decreases in systolic blood pressure and left ventricular ejection time were sustained during the 30-minute recovery
phase.

 Introduction
Heat therapy has many benefits for human physiology.
The heat stimulates the sensory receptors in the skin,
decreasing transmission of pain signals to the brain to
relieve discomfort, increases the flow of oxygen and
nutrients to the muscles, helping to heal damaged
tissue,
through
thermoregulatory
mechanisms
and
pathways.1,2 Previous studies have also shown an asso-
ciation between controlled heat stress and augmented
cardiovascular function.3–5
In line with these findings, it has also been suggested
that heat therapy may improve microvascular func-
tion.6 There are different ways to apply heat therapy,
such as using dry heat or warm water immersion.1
However, the use of dry heat via hot sauna exposure
has been gaining popularity, especially after it has been
shown to alleviate acute and chronic conditions such as
asthma, headaches, hypertension, incidence of colds
and other related broncho-constructive disorders.7–9 A
prospective study has also demonstrated that there is a
strong association between sauna exposure and a low-
ered risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) outcomes.10
In addition, it has been suggested that sauna therapy
may improve vascular compliance, which has been pre-
viously documented in subjects with coronary heart dis-
ease (CHD) risk factors,11 although the effects of sauna
bathing on arterial compliance have not been reported.
Arterial stiffness (AS) has been recognised as a risk
factor for atherosclerotic CVD and mortality.12–15
Although resting blood pressure (BP) level is con-
sidered a close surrogate measure to AS, studies have
shown that AS is a more accurate indicator of vessel
function.16 Consistently, some studies have shown that
AS is considered to be a stronger risk factor for cardio-
vascular mortality than brachial BP alone16,17 and,
therefore, increased AS is independently associated
with adverse cardiovascular events.18 However, to our
best knowledge, no experimental studies on the acute
effects of sauna bathing on AS and haemodynamic par-
ameters have been conducted.
Pulse pressure (PP) and mean arterial pressure
(MAP) have been well documented as markers of car-
diovascular risk in different clinical settings19,20 Pulse
pressure is a pulsatile component of the BP curve as
opposed to MAP, defined as the difference between sys-
tolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure
(DBP), and has been demonstrated to predict cardio-
vascular mortality in the general population.21,22
The current gold standard for assessing AS is through
the
measurement
of
pulse
wave
velocity
(PWV).
However, a change in PWV could be supplemented via
alterations in vascular pressure and/or left ventricular
ejection time (LVET). This reflects a natural change in
arterial wall properties without haemodynamic shifts, as
the pulsatile nature of blood flow in large arteries is
mainly regulated by arterial distensibility, ventricular
function and arterial pressure. Better understanding of
these underlying mechanisms may help in explaining the
acute physiological responses of the vascular system in
maintaining homeostasis against heat exposure.
Therefore, using a non-randomised experimental
study, we aimed to investigate the acute haemodynamic
and vascular responses among asymptomatic partici-
pants with cardiovascular risk factors and their recov-
ery profiles after 30 min of sauna bathing. This study
will further clarify if sauna bathing leads to significant
alterations in vascular and haemodynamic function,
including changes in PWV, MAP, PP and LVET
among this population.
Methods
Participants
A total of 102 participants were recruited from the city
of Jyva
¨ skyla
¨ , Central Finland region, through the local
out-of-hospital health care centre. The study group
consisted of asymptomatic participants (no cardio-
vascular symptoms) with at least one cardiovascular
risk factor, such as a history of smoking, dyslipidaemia,
hypertension, obesity, diabetes or family history of
CHD. All participants with acute or diagnosed CVD
were excluded. Prior to participation in the study, all
participants were informed about the research pur-
poses and measurement procedures, and were screened
by a cardiac specialist. The research protocol and
study
design
were
approved
by
the
institutional
review board of the Central Finland Hospital District
ethical committee, Jyva
¨ skyla
¨ , Finland (Dnro 5U/2016).
All
study
participants
provided
written
informed
consent prior to the inclusion in the study. The
study was performed as stated by the Declaration of
Helsinki.
Clinical examination
A clinical evaluation with baseline data collection was
conducted on a separate day prior to the experiment.
All baseline and sauna measurements were conducted
during June and November 2016. During the screening
visit, medical history, physical examination, blood lipid
levels
and
resting
electrocardiogram
(ECG)
were
assessed. A maximal exercise test was conducted on a
separate day to determine the level of fitness. Resting
BP was estimated as the mean of two measurements
obtained while the participant was in a supine position
based on a standardised measurement protocol. Body
mass index (BMI) was calculated by dividing weight in
kg by the square of height in meters.

 Sauna exposure
Sauna exposure in this experiment was based on a trad-
itional Finnish sauna, which is characterised by air with
a relative humidity of 10–20% and high temperature.10
In our study, relative humidity of the air was 10–20%
and the temperature over the entire course of the
experiment was 73 � 2�C. The sauna temperature in
each room was recorded continuously as 10-second
averages using a two-channel internal temperature
sensor
designed
by
Harvia
Oy,
Finland.
Sauna
exposure was based on typical Finnish sauna bathing
sessions; the total duration was 30 min, and it was inter-
spersed with a short, two-minute shower at 15-minute
intervals. Participants wore their own swimsuits during
the sauna session and there were separate sauna rooms
for women and men; the sauna rooms were similar in
the terms of space, humidity, temperature and air
conditioning.
Before
the
sauna
experiments,
all
participants
received written and verbal instructions informing
them to avoid meal, caffeine and smoking within
three hours of the measurement, and that speaking
and sleeping during the measurement was prohibited.
All measurements were taken in a quiet room with a
stable temperature (21�C) on the right side of the body
in the supine position. Participants were supervised by a
physician and were allowed to leave the sauna at any
time they felt uncomfortable. All participants under-
went the recommended sauna protocol successfully.
They were instructed to rest in a designated waiting
lounge at room temperature (temperature 21�C) for
the whole recovery period after the immediate post
sauna measurement. Water intake was ad libitum.
Study participants were allowed to drink 500 ml still
water during sauna and recovery period, according to
the guidance of the local ethical committee
Outcome definitions
Assessment of AS parameters. The measurement of AS
during this experiment followed closely established
guidelines.23 Measurements of AS were performed by
using the PulsePen device (DiaTecne s.r.l., Milan, Italy;
www.pulsepen.com) which is composed of one tonom-
eter and an integrated ECG unit. The PulsePen is made
of a pressure probe the size and shape of a ballpoint pen
with a built-in acquisition device that serves to non-
invasively detect the pressure waveform by means of
applanation tonometry. The unit is connected to the
computer by means of an optical fibre that ensures elec-
tromagnetic isolation for the patient undergoing the
test. Data analysis is performed by specially designed
software at a sample rate of 500 Hz.24 The device soft-
ware does not validate measurements if the difference
between BP or heart rate (HR) values taken at the time
of carotid and peri-pheral artery recordings was >10%.
All measurements before and after the sauna were
taken by a single trained operator of the tonometer.
The same transit distances measured during baseline
clinical evaluation were used throughout the experi-
ment for consistency and reliability.
PWV was measured by recording carotid and per-
ipheral (femoral) waveforms in rapid succession at a
sample rate of 1 kHz, and defined as the transit distance
between the measuring sites divided by the time delay
between the distal pulse and proximal pulse wave, using
the ECG trace as reference. Transit distances were
assessed by body surface measurements using a tape
measure from the suprasternal notch to each pulse
recording site (carotid and femoral). Direct carotid to
femoral measurement was adjusted to 80% (common
carotid artery–common femoral artery�0.8) for the cal-
culation of PWV as recommended by current guide-
lines.25 Transit time was defined as the difference
between the delay of the distal pulse wave to the R
wave belonging to the ECG qRs complex and the
delay of the proximal pulse wave to the R wave belong-
ing to the ECG qRs complex. The pulse wave delay was
determined by calculating the time elapsed from the
peak of the R wave and the ‘foot’ of the pressure
pulse wave.
The pressure values recorded by tonometry were
calibrated to the BP values obtained at the brachial
artery; where they were assigned to the appropriate
pixels and the values for MAP and all other pressure-
related parameters were re-established. The values
deduced by the software apply the established concept
that the MAP remains unchanged in the tract from the
aorta to the peripheral arteries. MAP was calculated by
the software as DBPþ1/3(SBP–DBP).24 LVET was
determined as the difference between heart period and
diastolic time (DT). Assessments of various AS param-
eters are shown in Figure 1.
LVET, DT and augmentation index (AIx) were
obtained from the carotid pressure waveform analysis.
The point corresponding to the end of LVET and the
beginning of DT is identified by the dicrotic notch in
the carotid pulse waveform. This point is automatically
estimated by the PulsePen software.26 AIx is a param-
eter which provides an indication of the contribution of
reflected waves to the total PP and was defined as the
difference between the second and first systolic peak on
arterial pulse waveform and was expressed as a percent-
age of central PP ((AIx)¼AP/PP � 100).27
Assessment of BP. Supine brachial SBP and DBP were
obtained using Microlife BP A200 (Microlife Corp.,
Taipei, Taiwan) for better sensitivity and accuracy.28
Two sequential readings were measured and the mean
values were used. Participants rested in the supine

 position for 10 min before PWV was measured at base-
line. However, due to the nature of the study, AS was
measured immediately and 30 min after the sauna
exposure without having laid supine for 10 min.
Statistical analyses
Data are presented as means � standard deviations
(SDs) and frequencies as appropriate. Normally distrib-
uted
data
were
analysed for
within-group
(time)
changes with a repeated measure analysis of variance
(ANOVA). Normality was checked using the Shapiro-
Wilk test as well as through observing the Q-Q-plots.
Non-normally distributed data was log-transformed to
achieve normality and thereafter analysed. The level for
significance
was
set
at
p � 0.05.
Within-group
differences
between
before
vs
immediately
after,
before vs 30 min recovery and immediately after vs
30 min recovery from sauna were analysed using pair-
wise t-tests, and p-values were corrected for Bonferroni
by multiplying all pairwise p-values with the number of
comparisons conducted for each variable.
All statistical analyses were carried out with Stata
version 14.1 (Stata Corp, College Station, Texas,
USA) and IBM SPSS Statistics v.22 software (IBM
Corporation, Armonk, New York, USA).
Results
Characteristics of participants
In this study population, there were 56 male and
46 female participants. The characteristics of the par-
ticipants are shown in Table 1. The mean age and BMI
of participants was 51.9 years (SD 9.2) and 27.9 kg/m2
(SD 4.7) respectively and the most common underlying
clinical
conditions
were
dyslipidaemia
(63%)
and
hypertension (14%). Body weight of the participants
did not change statistically significantly during the
sauna session (pre-sauna: 82.7 (16.0) kg vs post-
sauna: 83.0 (15.7) kg).
Changes in arterial stiffness
Table 2 shows changes in measures of AS after
30 min of sauna exposure. Mean PWV value before
sauna was 9.8 m/s, decreased significantly to 8.6 m/s
immediately after sauna, and was 9.0 m/s after a
30-minute recovery period (p < 0.001 for ANOVA).
Values of AIx and LVET decreased statistically sig-
nificantly immediately after the sauna session; for
LVET, the decrease was still significant after 30 min
of recovery. However, AIx recovered to its initial
levels after 30 min of recovery (Table 2). Diastolic

 time decreased significantly due to sauna exposure
from 635.1 (�115.1) to 494.6 (�113.0) m/s, and
increased back to the pre-sauna level after 30 min of
recovery.
Changes in arterial pressure, augmented pressure,
PP and pulse pressure amplification (PPa)
Changes in measures of central haemodynamics are
shown in Table 3. MAP decreased significantly from
99.4 (�15.0) mm Hg before sauna to 93.6 (�10.3)
mm Hg immediately after sauna, but MAP recovered
at 30 min after sauna to 95.9 (�14.2). However, changes
from immediately after sauna to 30 min of recovery in
MAP were not statistically significant. PP decreased
significantly from after the sauna exposure to the recov-
ery period, being 44.9 (�9.8) mm Hg immediately after
sauna, and reducing to 39.3 (�8.3) mm Hg at 30 min of
recovery (Table 3). There were no statistically signifi-
cant changes for AP and PPa at all time-points during
the sauna bathing.
Changes in brachial BP and HR
Sauna bathing had significant effects on BP (Table 4).
SBP was 137 mm Hg before the sauna session, which
decreased significantly to 130 mm Hg immediately after
the

session
(p < 0.001

82 mm Hg, 75 mm Hg, and 81 mm Hg, respectively
(Table 4). HR increased from 65 to 80 beats/min as a
result of the 30-minute sauna exposure but returned to
66 beats/min after the 30-minute recovery period
(Table 4).
Discussion
This study showed that heat exposure of sauna bathing
has acute effects on AS among participants who have at
least one cardiovascular risk factor. The main finding
from this study was that sauna bathing has several
important effects on vascular and haemodynamic func-
tion. We found that sauna bathing leads to lower levels
of PWV, AIx and DT, with short-term decreases in
both MAP and DBP, which were observed immediately
after sauna bathing. On the other hand, decreased
levels of SBP and LVET were sustained until the end
of the 30-minute recovery phase. The indices of AS
including PWV, AIx, MAP and LVET changed in the
same direction during the sauna bathing. HR and PP
yielded a short-term response in the opposite direction;
showing an increase immediately after the sauna expos-
ure before returning to resting levels or even below the
baseline level, while no notable changes were found for
AP and PPa.
PWV was modulated positively after 30 min of heat
exposure while the reduction in SBP levels remained
significant
when
comparing
baseline
values
to
30-minute
recovery
data.
It
has
been
previously
shown that PWV is more closely related to left ventricu-
lar systolic function than to heart period.26 The associ-
ation between PWV and LVET can be attributed to
myocardial function, where the two share an inverse
relationship. The decrease in LVET in parallel with
PWV was therefore an interesting finding.
As postulated by Salvi and coworkers,26 when there
is a decrease in systolic ejection time, the time taken by
the left ventricle to do mechanical work is shortened,
thus resulting in an increase in BP and velocity of
travelling waves, which in turn leads to an increase in
PWV. However, the opposite was found as a result of
sauna exposure. Nonetheless, the authors concluded
that PWV may be a determinant of LVET; this is sup-
ported by the results from our study in that the changes
in PWV and LVET were consistent immediately after
sauna bathing and the 30-minute recovery period.
These findings are further supported by the observa-
tion that changes in cardiac afterload did not affect the
duration of left ventricular ejection.29 Secondly, LVET
could be the time interval of the cardiac cycle respon-
sible for the relationship between PWV and HR.30 In
this study, LVET decreased from 307 to 278 m/s after
sauna exposure and recovered towards initial levels
after a 30-minute period, which may at least partly indi-
cate a higher HR after sauna bathing. Indeed, results
from this experiment showed an increase in HR after
the sauna exposure. This is consistent with the changes
in DT due to sauna bathing, where DT was decreased
immediately after the sauna session and returned to
initial levels during the recovery.
The increase in HR seen in our study did not make a
significant contribution to PPa, although it has been
supposed that changes in HR and LVET would medi-
ate changes in AP and AIx, thus modifying the PPa
level.31 Our results showed that acute sauna exposure
increased HR and decreased LVET, which in turn
resulted in a significant decrease in AIx, even though
AP showed no change. This may be indicative of the
contribution of HR to wave reflection and AIx.32 AIx is
commonly accepted as a measure of enhancement of
central aortic pressure by a reflected pulse wave and
is considered to measure a different aspect of AS.27
This study showed that AIx decreased significantly
after the sauna session, which may be associated with
peripheral vascular changes (vasodilation) after sauna
bathing, although it is likely that the increase in PP
mediated the decrease in AIx.
Interestingly, the results from our study showed a
transient increase in PP with no significant concomitant
decrease in PPa. High PP has been shown to be an

 independent predictor of mortality in patients with
heart failure33 and has been postulated to be a signifi-
cant predictor of CHD risk.34,35 In addition, a reduc-
tion
in
PPa
has
been
proposed
as
a
potential
mechanical biomarker of global arterial function and
cardiovascular risk.31 The increase in PP and HR
through sauna exposure also did not coincide with an
increase in PPa as suggested by other studies.32
However, in this study, the decreases in PP were
found after a 30-minute recovery period, suggesting
beneficial cardiovascular effects of a 30-minute sauna
exposure.
In our current study setting, sauna bathing was able
to acutely reduce BP and MAP. Decreases in BP and
MAP are clinically important findings from this study,
showing the effect of sauna bathing on BP parameters.
Since hot sauna bathing can produce acute vasodilation
which leads to a significant drop in BP,36 longer term
sauna bathing could potentially lead to a reduction in
systemic BP, which is supported by our recent findings
on regular sauna bathing and a lowered risk of hyper-
tension.37 In patients with slightly elevated BP, a single
sauna session produces positive lowering effects on sys-
temic BP.38 These findings are comparable with exercise
training and BP-related studies39,40 investigating the
acute effects of BP changes. Decreases in systemic BP
with a concomitant increase in HR seen in the current
study are likely due to sympathetic and parasympa-
thetic regulation of the heart. Furthermore, passive
heating has been shown to reduce PWV.41 In addition
to increased body temperature and its positive effects,
sauna bathing may have decreased plasma volume
which is further related to changes in haemodynamic
parameters such as decreased AS and systemic BP.
Therefore, it is possible that heat therapy such as
sauna
may
reduce
AS
via
body
dehydration.42
Consequently, in assessment of PWV during sauna ses-
sions, body fluid balance should be taken into account
which includes ensuring adequate hydration status.
Strengths
Our study was based on a large number of participants,
which provided adequate pre-defined power to assess
changes in haemodynamic and vascular responses
after sauna bathing. The assessment of cardiovascular
parameters including BP and AS were performed using
standard measurement protocols.24,43 Arterial tonome-
try with simultaneous ECG was obtained with the use
of a commercially available tonometer that has been
well validated previously.24,25,44 This allowed us to col-
lect data that represented the respective time-points
more accurately. The measurement of the PWV is a
simple, non-invasive and rapid way to assess the com-
pliance of great arteries. An expert operator may assess
PWV data quickly, including the insertion of patient’s
data into the computer, and the measurement protocol
is convenient for the subjects. In addition, although the
assessment of AS has been documented to have reason-
able levels of reproducibility, with an intra-observer
coefEcient of variation (CV) of 4.8% and interobserver
CV of 7.3%, our utilisation of a single trained operator
throughout the whole study adds more reliability to the
results. Sauna bathing is a safe activity in populations
with cardiovascular risk factors and it has been shown
that acute exposure to Finnish sauna and cold-water
immersion causes haemodynamic alterations in chronic
heart failure patients without serious adverse events.5
Limitations
The
sauna
intervention
was
short-term
and
we
employed a before and after design without the use of
a control group as this study was designed to explore
the effects of a single sauna session. Based on data from
the non-randomised study focusing on changes in AS,
many vascular system alterations appear to be func-
tional and transient due to a single sauna session.
However, structural changes such as alterations in the
elastin-collagen
fibres
and
re-organization
of
the
extracellular matrix of the arterial wall cannot be dis-
counted, and may still occur with long-term regular
sauna exposure. This is an area that warrants further
research as sauna bathing remains as one of the most
accessible, convenient and safe modes of heat exposure
that
can provide
possible
cardiovascular
benefits.
Further studies utilising a similar intervention method
and
longer-term
randomised
controlled
trials
are
needed in order to gain a better perspective of the
effects of sauna bathing (heat stress) on the cardiovas-
cular system and its overall health effects. Although the
duration and method used for the sauna exposure
mimicked a typical Finnish sauna, we did not measure
PWV over the entire duration of recovery to track its
time course profile in this population. As a result, we do
not have complete information of when PWV and other
related AS indices recovered to the baseline level. The
diversity of the participants included in the study may
have influenced the results, in that the youngest partici-
pant was 32 years of age, while the oldest was 75 years.
In addition, the body composition of the participants
also varied greatly within genders, ranging from 23.8–
31.0 kg/m2 for women, and between 25.1–30.6 kg/m2
for men. However, the size of the study population
was large enough to show significant haemodynamic
and vascular effects of sauna bathing in a representative
population with risk factors for CVD, and therefore,
the results may be generalised to a similar patient popu-
lation. Finally, though the target temperature for sauna
exposure in our experiment as set by the sauna meter
Lee et al.
7
 was 84�C, the mean temperature recorded by the inter-
nal temperature sensor was 73 � 2�C, which may seem
lower than a typical Finnish sauna session. However,
this is usually the case for typical sauna sessions; when
sauna temperatures are set between 80–90�C, the true
temperature within the sauna room is usually lower.
This was evident because we employed a reliable two-
channel internal temperature sensor which recorded the
room temperature continuously as 10-second averages.
Conclusions
This novel study indicated that sauna bathing leads to
improvements in cardiovascular function, including
improved arterial compliance and decreased systemic
BP. The study shows that 30 min of heat exposure in
the sauna leads to positive changes in PWV and other
arterial-related indexes. Further research is needed to
show whether sauna bathing combined with physical
exercise may produce similar or pronounced effect on
AS parameters.
