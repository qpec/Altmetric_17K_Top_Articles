Dear Professor York, 
Thank you for the opportunity to submit a revised version of the MS entitled 
“Childhood predictors of cardiovascular disease in adulthood. A systematic review 
and meta-analysis”. 
 
The comments from referee 1 have been very helpful in improving the clarity of the 
MS, and our response is attached.  
 
We confirm that this work is original and has not been published elsewhere. 
We report the results of a systematic review and meta-analysis examining the ability 
of anthropometric measures of obesity in childhood to predict dysglycemia and adult 
atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ACVD).  
 
To our knowledge, this is the first analysis of longitudinal studies, investigating the 
ability of Body Mass Index, weight gain, skinfold thickness, and waist circumference 
to predict the risk of ACVD, 
 
The paper should be of interest to readers in the areas of obesity, cardiovascular 
disease risk, cardiac and vascular function.

Abstract  
42 
Childhood obesity predicts the risk of adult adiposity, which is associated with the 
43 
earlier onset of cardiovascular disease [adult atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, 
44 
ACVD: hypertension, increased carotid intima media thickness (CIMT) stroke, 
45 
ischemic heart disease (IHD)] and dysglycemia. Because it is not known whether 
46 
childhood obesity contributes to these diseases, we conducted a systematic review of 
47 
studies that examine the ability of measures of obesity in childhood to predict 
48 
dysglycemia and ACVD. 
49 
Data sources were: Web of Science, MEDLINE, PubMed, CINAHL, Cochrane, 
50 
SCOPUS, ProQuest, and reference lists. Studies measuring BMI, SF, and WC were 
51 
selected; of 1954 studies, 18 met study criteria. 
52 
Results: Childhood BMI predicted CIMT: OR, 3.39 (95% CI, 2.02 to 5.67, P <0.001) 
53 
and risk of impaired glucose tolerance in adulthood, but its ability to predict ACVD 
54 
events (stroke, IHD; OR, 1.04; 95% CI, 1.02 to 1.07; P<0.001) and hypertension (OR, 
55 
1.17, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.27, P = 0.003), was weak-moderate. BMI was not predictive 
56 
of systolic BP (r -0.57, P =0.08) and weakly predicted diastolic BP (r 0.21, P =0.002). 
57 
SF in childhood weakly predicted CIMT in female adults only (rs0.09, P <0.05).  
58 
Conclusion: Childhood BMI predicts the risk of dysglycemia and abnormal CIMT in 
59 
adulthood but its ability to predict hypertension and ACVD events was weak and 
60 
moderate respectively. SF was a weak predictor of CIMT in female adults.

INTRODUCTION 
70 
Obesity has become increasingly prevalent worldwide in both children and adults 1,2.  
71 
It is detected by specific cut-offs in anthropometric measures - the most popular of 
72 
which is the body mass index (BMI) 3,4. Although used less often in clinical practice, 
73 
measures of adiposity such as waist circumference (WC) and skin fold thickness (SF) 
74 
are thought to be more predictive of adiposity-related comorbid conditions - perhaps 
75 
because they more closely correlate with the presence of excess body fat 5,6 
76 
Irrespective of how it is measured, adult obesity is associated with dysglycemia and 
77 
an increased incidence of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ACVD) and type 2 
78 
diabetes (T2D) 1, 7, which together are responsible for over half of all deaths from 
79 
non-communicable diseases worldwide 8. Although the relationship between adult 
80 
obesity and ACVD risk factors is convincing 9, the association of anthropometric 
81 
measures of obesity in childhood with disease in adulthood remains uncertain10. This 
82 
is despite the fact that increased adiposity in childhood is predictive of overweight 
83 
adults11, and that ACVD risk factors are more prevalent in obese children than those 
84 
of normal weight 12, 13. The predictive ability of anthropometry in childhood 19, 20 may 
85 
relate to the method used to determine obesity. For instance, in children, BMI 
86 
explains just 40% of the variance in insulin resistance 14,15, whereas WC appears more 
87 
predictive of insulin resistance and dyslipidaemia 16,17. SF has been reported to 
88 
increase the sensitivity of WC to detect dysglycemia by up to 15% 18.  To investigate 
89 
this, we systematically reviewed and pooled data from longitudinal studies that 
90 
examined the association between anthropometric measures of childhood adiposity 
91 
and adult ACVD, prediabetes and type 2 diabetes.

METHODS 
95 
 
96 
We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of longitudinal cohort studies of 
97 
anthropometric measures of obesity (Body Mass Index-BMI, skinfold thickness-SF, 
98 
and waist circumference-WC) in childhood and the relationship to the risk of ACVD 
99 
and dysglycemia in adulthood. We followed the Meta-analysis of Observational 
100 
Studies in Epidemiology guidelines for meta-analyses and systematic reviews of 
101 
observational studies (MOOSE)21.  
102 
Search Strategy  
103 
We used a systematic approach for searching the literature with specific eligibility 
104 
criteria. We searched 7 electronic databases: Web of Science, MEDLINE, PubMed, 
105 
CINAHL, Cochrane, SCOPUS and ProQuest from inception through September 2014 
106 
to identify appropriate literature. We also searched the bibliographies of the included 
107 
studies to identify any other relevant articles. Our search strategy utilized medical 
108 
subject headings (MeSH)/ index terms across databases including the terms: BMI, 
109 
change in BMI, skinfold, waist circumference, cerebrovascular disease, stroke, 
110 
hypertension, ischemic heart disease, coronary artery disease, vascular dysfunction, 
111 
carotid intima media thickness, dysglycemia, impaired fasting glucose, impaired 
112 
glucose tolerance, type 2 diabetes, adult, and child. The full search strategy is 
113 
provided in the supplemental data and on the international prospective register of 
114 
systematic reviews (PROSPERO, registration number CRD42014014392).  
115 
Study selection (figure 1) 
116 
All relevant abstracts were downloaded into an online reference management system 
117 
(RefWorks; ProQuest LLC). Using a screening tool, two reviewers (O.A, C.B.) 
118 
independently evaluated and screened all citations and abstracts for eligibility. Studies 
119 
Page 5 of 33
Obesity Reviews
  
 
included were longitudinal studies of healthy children recruited between 2 and 18 
120 
years of age, where BMI, change in BMI, SF or WC were used as predictors of blood 
121 
pressure, ACVD (carotid intima media thickness, hypertension or events including 
122 
cerebrovascular disease/stroke ischemic heart disease or vascular dysfunction) or 
123 
dysglycemia (impaired fasting glucose, impaired glucose tolerance or T2D) in 
124 
adulthood (defined as ≥ 18 years). Although not considered direct measures of 
125 
adiposity, because of the link between pubertal timing and obesity 22, studies of peak 
126 
height and weight velocity were included. No limits were placed on the searches in 
127 
terms of sample size, duration of follow-up, region/country/language of publication. 
128 
Studies were excluded if the participants were part of an intervention program, if 
129 
outcomes were self-reported, if anthropometric measures were classified using 
130 
arbitrary cut-off points, or if children with a diagnosis of malignancy, diabetes, 
131 
hypertension, preterm birth or low birth weight were included. A third reviewer 
132 
compared the entered data and resolved inconsistencies by referring to the full text 
133 
article (M.W.). 
134 
Data extraction 
135 
For each study we extracted baseline characteristics of the participants (age, gender 
136 
and birth cohort) and study characteristics (location, length of follow-up, 
137 
anthropometric measure [BMI, SF, PHV, PWV, and WC] and outcome measure). 
138 
Data were directly extracted from the article or from figures. Multiple attempts were 
139 
made to contact authors in order to obtain for data missing from published results.  
140 
Study Quality Assessment 
141 
Study quality was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) 23 for cohort 
142 
studies.  This scale assigns ‘star ratings’ based on several criteria including:  
143 
Page 6 of 33
Obesity Reviews
  
 
• The representativeness of the study population compared to the community 
144 
average 
145 
• Demonstration that the outcome of interest was not present at the start of the 
146 
study,  
147 
• How the outcome was assessed, and  
148 
• Whether follow-up was of sufficient duration for outcomes to occur. 
149 
Statistical Analysis 
150 
The data analysis was performed using the Mantel-Haenszel method by meta-analysis 
151 
software ‘Comprehensive Meta-Analysis 2.0’ (Biostat, Englewood, NJ, United 
152 
States). For each study, we calculated the odds ratio (OR) or means for the primary 
153 
outcome measure of adiposity. The ORs and means were presented with 95% 
154 
confidence intervals (CIs), with a P-value < 0.05 considered significant. We estimated 
155 
the degree of heterogeneity among the trial results using the χ2 statistic (with a P-
156 
value < 0.10 considered significant) and the I2 test (25%, 50%, and 75% represent 
157 
low, moderate and high heterogeneity, respectively). Whenever significant 
158 
heterogeneity (P < 0.1 or I2 > 50%) was detected, we used the random effects model 
159 
to combine the effect sizes of included studies; otherwise, the fixed effects model was 
160 
utilized. Subgroup analyses were performed for systolic and diastolic blood pressure, 
161 
but not for those investigating peak height and weight velocity to avoid data dredging; 
162 
more so there were no other studies found with similar outcomes making it impossible 
163 
to conduct further quantitative analysis of these studies. We assessed the presence of 
164 
publication bias with a funnel plot of standard error by log odds ratio (see Figure 1). 
165 
Large studies appear at the top of the graph and cluster near the mean effect size. The 
166 
absence of significant publication bias is indicated by a symmetrical distribution 
167 
around the combined effect size.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
169 
The search identified 1954 citations (1934 from database searches and 20 from 
170 
reference lists) from which 18 studies were found relevant to this review. The 
171 
selection process has been represented using a PRISMA flow diagram (Figure 2) 
172 
Most of the studies were conducted in industrialized countries: six in North America 
173 
24-29, five in Finland 30-34, four in the United Kingdom 35-38, one each in India 39, 
174 
Denmark 40, and The Netherlands 41. Of the total of 317,133 adults studied, the 
175 
majority were white Caucasian. The mean age at which baseline childhood data was 
176 
collected was 10y, and mean follow-up was 25 years. Table 1 shows the 
177 
characteristics of each study; Five studies were excluded from the meta-analysis 
178 
because the method of statistical analysis (rank correlation coefficients which cannot 
179 
be converted to odds ratio) precluded inclusion 26, the study subjects were classified 
180 
based on BMI category/glycemic function in childhood 24, 30, 33, or because there were 
181 
insufficient studies within a subgroup for adequate comparison 33. As further analysis 
182 
of these studies could not be undertaken, a qualitative summary of the results was 
183 
prepared; these studies were not included in any statistical analyses.  
184 
 
185 
Childhood predictors for adult atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and/or 
186

187 
Studies used one or more of the following: BMI, standardized BMI scores, change in 
188 
BMI, SF, or combination of BMI and skin folds (SF) 28 as childhood predictors, with 
189 
the exception of Tzoulaki et al 33 in which peak height velocity (PHV) and peak 
190 
weight velocity (PWV) were used as childhood predictors.

Outcome measures 
194 
Seven studies assessed the presence of ACVD by carotid intima media thickness 
195 
(CIMT) 26,28,29 31,32, 38, 41 , three studied the incidence of ACVD events 34, 36, 40, while 
196 
five examined blood pressure (BP) or the presence of hypertension 25, 27, 33, 35, 37. 
197 
Hypertension was defined as at least one of the following: prescription for blood 
198 
pressure lowering medication, systolic BP (SBP) ≥140 mmHg, and diastolic BP 
199 
(DBP) ≥90 mmHg. Of the three studies that investigated the incidence of dysglycemia 
200 
24, 33, 39, two used both impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and T2D 24, 39 and one 
201 
studied the association with T2D alone 33. IGT and T2D were defined by either the 
202 
American Diabetes Association (ADA; 1997) 24, 33 or the WHO (1998) 39 criteria. 
203 
Study Quality and Publication Bias 
204 
Study quality was assessed using appropriate elements of the Newcastle-Ottawa scale 
205 
23 (Table 2). All the studies scored at least four ‘stars’ out of a possible six indicating 
206 
good methodological quality. We assessed the presence of publication bias with a 
207 
funnel plot of standard error by log odds ratio (Figure 1). The absence of significant 
208 
publication bias is indicated by a symmetrical distribution around the combined effect 
209 
size. 
210 
Meta-analysis 
211 
Figure 3 provides the forest plot with pooled estimates and 95% CI values for the 
212 
ability of childhood BMI to predict outcomes (detailed below). Table 3 provides the 
213 
relative weight of each study.  
214 
 
215 
BMI/SF and CIMT 
216 
Childhood BMI was predictive of CIMT in adulthood (OR, 3.5; 95% CI, 1.1 – 11.1, P 
217 
= 0.034) even after adjusting for adult BMI. With the variability across the studies 
218 
Page 9 of 33
Obesity Reviews
  
 
exceeding what would be expected based purely on sampling error (I2 98.9%, n=6 
219 
studies), random effects analysis was conducted. Two studies were not included in the 
220 
quantitative analysis because the statistical method of analysis used was not 
221 
compatible for meta-analysis 26 27. Field et al 27 found that a 1- standard deviation 
222 
increase in SF in childhood was associated with 16 µm increase in CIMT in adulthood 
223 
while Davis et al 26 found very weak correlations between BMI/SF in childhood and 
224 
adult CIMT in females (BMI: spearman rank correlation 
 0.18, P <0.001, SF 
 
225 
0.09, P <0.05).   
226 
BMI and AVCD events 
227 
Childhood BMI had a negligible ability to predict the development of ACVD events 
228 
in adulthood, (OR, 1.04; 95% CI, 1.02 to 1.07; P<0.001). None of the studies 
229 
however, made statistical adjustment for the effect of BMI in adulthood. The 
230 
variability across the studies did not exceed what would be expected based on 
231 
sampling error (I2 11.2%, n=3 studies). 
232 
BMI, blood pressure and hypertension 
233 
After statistical adjustments were made for the impact of adult BMI, childhood BMI 
234 
was weakly predictive of adult diastolic blood pressure (mean, 0.25; 95% CI, 0.003 to 
235 
0.386; P=0.046) but not systolic blood pressure (mean, -0.57, 95% CI, -1.22 to 0.07; 
236 
P=0.082). Due to the presence of moderate variability across the studies for diastolic 
237 
pressure (I2 53%), random effects analysis was conducted. BMI in childhood 
238 
predicted the risk of adult hypertension (OR, 1.17, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.27, P = 0.003) 35, 
239 
40, while Tzoulaki et al 33 found no relationship between peak weight velocity in 
240 
childhood and adult hypertension. 
241 
BMI and dysglycemia  
242 
Page 10 of 33
Obesity Reviews
  
 
Nguyen et al 24 found that neither BMI nor childhood weight gain predicted the risk 
243 
of adult diabetes. However the odds ratios of developing prediabetes in adulthood 
244 
using baseline BMI and change in BMI in childhood were 1.44 and 1.85 respectively. 
245 
By contrast, the odds ratios of adult prediabetes for those at the top decile for fasting 
246 
insulin and HOMA-IR (insulin resistance) in childhood were 2.85 and 2.55 
247 
respectively. Conversely, Fall et al 39 found that those who gained weight in 
248 
childhood were more likely to develop IGT/T2D in adulthood (regression coefficient 
249 
1.25, P=0.01) as did Koskinen et al30, who found that overweight youths without the 
250 
metabolic syndrome were 3.9 times more likely to develop T2D in adulthood, 
251 
compared to those of with the metabolic syndrome but of normal weight. None of 
252 
these studies made statistical adjustments for the effect of adult BMI. 
253 
Discussion 
254 
This systematic review and meta-analysis indicates that childhood BMI predicts the 
255 
risk of prediabetes and CIMT in adulthood. There was a modest predictive effect of 
256 
childhood BMI and adult hypertension 
257 
The ability of childhood BMI to predict adult ACVD events was weak. This could be 
258 
explained by the relatively slow progression of atherosclerosis in healthy young adults 
259 
or to a later change in environment or habits – for instance the uptake of cigarette 
260 
smoking, a significant risk factor, tends to occur no earlier than adolescence 42; the 
261 
smoking-related formation of focal plaques in coronary vessels is more predictive of 
262 
ischemic cardiovascular events than CIMT 43. BMI cannot discriminate fat from lean 
263 
mass, and the latter has a significant influence CIMT 44; this might explain why some 
264 
individuals with an abnormal CIMT and high BMI do not develop AVCD 45.  
265 
Although weight gain in childhood predicted T2D in adulthood, BMI predicted 
266 
prediabetes only. BMI is a weaker discriminator of visceral fat than measures such as 
267 
Page 11 of 33
Obesity Reviews
  
 
WC and this may impact on the ability of BMI to predict metabolic risk 46. Visceral 
268 
fat is associated with increased release of free fatty acids (delivered to the liver) and 
269 
pro-inflammatory cytokines, which lead to worsening insulin resistance 47. T2D 
270 
occurs once beta-cell function is no longer able to compensate for this insulin 
271 
resistance. Inter-individual differences in beta-cell function and/or mass may 
272 
therefore account for the ability of childhood BMI to predict adult prediabetes rather 
273 
than T2D. A longer duration of follow-up than that reported in the included studies, 
274 
may be required for T2D to develop. 
275 
Childhood BMI weakly predicted adult hypertension but did not predict adult systolic 
276 
blood pressure.  This may relate to the relatively low tracking of systolic blood 
277 
pressure measurements during childhood 46.  
278 
In most of the included studies, statistical adjustments were not made for the 
279 
confounding effect of adult BMI on the risk of ACVD events or dysglycemia 10.  In 
280 
the studies that did 32, 35, 40, there was a partial attenuation in the effect sizes seen, 
281 
indicating that adult BMI may have a confounding effect on the outcomes studied. 
282 
Also, other potential confounders like ethnicity, socioeconomic status, birth order, 
283 
and so forth that were not measured, introduce further bias in the estimated effect 
284 
sizes described; less prominent if there is significant correlation between them, more 
285 
so otherwise (unmeasured confounders) The weak/modest effect sizes seen in all the 
286 
outcomes might also be related to the short length of follow up between childhood 
287 
and adulthood (25 years). For instance, the average age at which a man in a 
288 
westernized country is diagnosed with an acute coronary event is 65y and just 4-10% 
289 
of cases of myocardial infarction occur before the age of 45y 48. A longer duration of 
290 
follow-up would mean the accrual of more ACVD and diabetes events.  More events 
291 
Page 12 of 33
Obesity Reviews
  
 
may increase the power to determine the effect of childhood anthropometric measures 
292 
in predicting adult disease.  
293 
The strengths of this systematic review and meta-analysis relate to the wide variety of 
294 
anthropometric measures of adiposity studied, and the use of a wide range of outcome 
295 
measures. We performed comprehensive searches of multiple databases and ensured 
296 
independent study selection and dual data extraction. Although performing a meta-
297 
analysis of observational epidemiological studies is often difficult due to incomplete 
298 
and unstandardized reporting of studies, the quality of the included studies was good, 
299 
and random effect analysis was conducted where significant inter-study variations 
300 
was present. Limitations of this review may be that searches were limited to studies 
301 
published in English; few studies examined SF and WC and so more studies are 
302 
required to confirm the applicability of these measures of adiposity in predicting the 
303 
risk of adult ACVD and dysglycemia. Finally, statistical methods like meta-regression 
304 
which may be helpful in explaining the cause of heterogeneity, was limited by the 
305 
number of studies in each subgroup. 
306 
This systematic review found that anthropometric measures of obesity in childhood 
307 
predicted CIMT and prediabetes in adulthood. Childhood obesity did not predict 
308 
ACVD event rates in adults.  Whether this relates to inherent inaccuracies of the 
309 
methods used to measure childhood obesity or to a lack of pathophysiologic effect of 
310 
childhood obesity requires further study.  The prevention and reduction of childhood 
311 
obesity should remain a priority for public health promotion programs.
