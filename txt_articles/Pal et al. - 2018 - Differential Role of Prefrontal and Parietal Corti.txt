In Brief
Pal et al. show that cholinergic, but not
noradrenergic, stimulation of prefrontal
cortex can restore level of consciousness
despite continuous anesthetic
administration. Cholinergic or
noradrenergic stimulation in the parietal
region did not alter the behavioral state.
Prefrontal cortex is a potential target for
modulating level of consciousness.

SUMMARY
Consciousness is determined both by level (e.g.,
being awake versus being anesthetized) and con-
tent (i.e., the qualitative aspects of experience).
Subcortical areas are known to play a causal role
in regulating the level of consciousness [1–9], but
the role of the cortex is less well understood. Clin-
ical and correlative data have been used both to
support and refute a role for prefrontal and poste-
rior cortices in the level of consciousness [10–22].
The prefrontal cortex has extensive reciprocal con-
nections to wake-promoting centers in the brain-
stem and diencephalon [23, 24], and hence is in a
unique position to modulate level of consciousness.
Furthermore, a recent study suggested that the
prefrontal cortex might be important in regulating
level of consciousness [25] but causal evidence,
and a comparison with more posterior cortical
sites, is lacking. Therefore, to test the hypothesis
that prefrontal cortex plays a role in regulating level
of consciousness, we attempted to reverse sevo-
flurane anesthesia by cholinergic or noradrenergic
stimulation of the prefrontal prelimbic cortex and
two areas of parietal cortex in rat. General anes-
thesia was defined by loss of the righting reflex, a
widely used surrogate measure in rodents. We
demonstrate that cholinergic stimulation of prefron-
tal cortex, but not parietal cortex, restored wake-
like
behavior,
despite
continuous
exposure
to
clinically relevant concentrations of sevoflurane
anesthesia. Noradrenergic stimulation of the pre-
frontal and parietal areas resulted in electroenceph-
alographic activation but failed to produce any
signs of wake-like behavior. We conclude that
cholinergic mechanisms in prefrontal cortex can
regulate the level of consciousness.
RESULTS
Cholinergic Stimulation of Prefrontal Prelimbic Cortex
in Anesthetized Rat Is Sufficient to Restore Level of
Consciousness and Wake-like Behavior
Reverse dialysis delivery of 5 mM carbachol (a mixed cholinergic
agonist) into prefrontal prelimbic cortex (n = 11) during sevoflur-
ane anesthesia induced signs consistent with wakefulness in all
11 rats, and 4 out of the 11 rats regained complete mobility while
continuously breathing clinically relevant concentrations of sev-
oflurane anesthesia (1.9%–2.4%) (Figure 1A; see Video S1). The
change in behavior was preceded by low-voltage fast activity in
the electroencephalogram (Figure 1C), a feature of wakefulness.
Additionally, power spectral density analysis demonstrated that
the theta/delta frequency ratio, a standard metric for electroen-
cephalographic activation, increased significantly during carba-
chol delivery (p = 0.002, t(9) = �4.35, as compared to sevoflurane
anesthesia) (Figures 1E and 1F). The electroencephalographic
activation was also accompanied by an increase in respiration
rate (p = 0.002, t(5) = �6.27) (Figure 1I) and a small but significant
elevation of heart rate (p = 0.04, t(5) = �2.82) (Figure 1J). Of note,
carbachol-induced wake-like behavior was not a discrete event
but persisted despite continuous anesthetic exposure. As
opposed to cholinergic stimulation, reverse dialysis delivery of
20 mM noradrenaline (n = 11) into the prefrontal cortex of sevo-
flurane-anesthetized rats did not produce any change in level
of consciousness (Figure 1B; see Video S2) but did change
the electroencephalographic pattern from high-voltage slow
waves to low-voltage fast activity (Figure 1D). The low-voltage
fast electroencephalogram showed an increased theta/delta
ratio (p = 0.02, t(7) = �3.06, as compared to sevoflurane anes-
thesia), thereby confirming activation (Figures 1G and 1H).
Noradrenaline also produced an increase in respiration rate
(p = 0.001, t(7) = �5.30) (Figure 1K), but there was no significant
change in heart rate (p = 0.2, t(7) = 1.57) (Figure 1L). These data
demonstrate that cholinergic stimulation of prefrontal prelimbic
cortex in the anesthetized rat is sufficient to restore level of con-
sciousness and wake-like behavior.
Consistent with our previous work [26], sevoflurane anesthesia
produced a significant decrease in acetylcholine levels in

 prefrontal cortex in both the carbachol (p < 0.0001, t(9) = 13.86)
and noradrenaline (p < 0.0001, t(10) = 12.96) groups, which was
reversed by local delivery of carbachol or noradrenaline
(Figures 1M and 1N). Carbachol in prefrontal cortex produced
a substantial increase (�600%) in local acetylcholine levels as
compared to both waking (p < 0.0001, t(9) = �9.09) and sevoflur-
ane anesthesia (p < 0.0001, t(9) = �10.74) (Figure 1M). Following
noradrenaline delivery, the acetylcholine levels showed a
modest
(�50%)
but
statistically
significant
increase
as
compared to sevoflurane anesthesia (p = 0.001, t(10) = �5.70)
that was not significantly different from the baseline waking state
(p = 0.2, t(10) = 2.54) (Figure 1N). The acetylcholine levels in the
carbachol group stayed significantly high during the post-sevo-
flurane recovery epoch as compared to both waking (p = 0.003,
t(9)
=
�5.41)
and
sevoflurane
anesthesia
(p
=
0.0008,
t(9) = �6.34) epochs (Figure 1M); there was no significant differ-
ence in acetylcholine levels between carbachol and recovery
wake epochs (p = 1, t(9) = 0.43). In contrast, the acetylcholine
levels during the post-sevoflurane recovery wake epoch in the
noradrenaline group were significantly lower as compared
to both waking (p < 0.0001, t(10) = 11.76) and noradrenaline
(p = 0.005, t(10) = 4.67) epochs (Figure 1N).
Cholinergic Stimulation of the Parietal Region (Posterior
Parietal Cortex and Medial Parietal Association Cortex)
in Anesthetized Rat Does Not Affect the Level of
Consciousness
In order to confirm the site specificity of the effects observed in
prefrontal cortex—and to test the alternate hypothesis [11, 16,
17, 20] that posterior cortical areas, including parietal cortex,
play a critical role in consciousness—we conducted similar
cholinergic stimulation (5 mM carbachol) in two distinct regions
within parietal cortex of two separate groups of rats: (1) posterior
parietal cortex (n = 11), which is primarily a somatosensory area
[27], and (2) medial parietal association cortex (n = 8), which is
linked to cognition and attention [28]. Medial parietal association
cortex receives afferents from dorsal retrosplenial cortex, ho-
mologous to the human posterior cingulate cortex [29], and
anterior thalamus rather than from sensorimotor areas [30]. An
additional group of rats was similarly prepared for dialysis deliv-
ery of noradrenaline into posterior parietal cortex (n = 11). Carba-
chol delivery into posterior parietal cortex during sevoflurane
anesthesia did not induce wake-like behavior and none of the
rats made any attempts at righting; some of the rats did display
uncoordinated
spastic
muscle
twitches
and
occasional
movements
in
whiskers,
limb,
and
tail
(Figure
2A;
see
Video S1). Noradrenaline delivery into posterior parietal cortex
during sevoflurane anesthesia also failed to produce any change
in the level of consciousness such as wake-like behavior (Fig-
ure 2B; see Video S2). Similar to cholinergic and noradrenergic
stimulation of prefrontal cortex, carbachol and noradrenaline
delivery into posterior parietal cortex produced an electroen-
cephalographic pattern consistent with activation, i.e., the
appearance of low-voltage fast electroencephalogram (Figures
2C and 2D) and increase in the theta/delta ratio (for carbachol
group: p < 0.001, t(10) = �8.72; for noradrenaline group:
p = 0.008, t(10) = �3.32; compared to sevoflurane anesthesia)
(Figures 2E–2H). Both carbachol (p = 0.0008, t(8) = �5.24) and
noradrenaline (p = 0.03, t(8) = �2.6) increased the respiration
rate (Figures 2I and 2K) but there was no significant change in
heart rate (p = 0.06, t(8) = �2.24 for carbachol group; p = 0.7,
t(8) = 0.48 for noradrenaline group) (Figures 2J and 2L). Sevoflur-
ane anesthesia produced a decrease in acetylcholine levels in
posterior parietal cortex in both the carbachol (p < 0.0001,
t(10) = 39.41) (Figure 2M) and noradrenaline (p < 0.0001,
t(10) = 30.33) (Figure 2N) groups. As compared to sevoflurane
epoch, dialysis delivery of carbachol and noradrenaline pro-
duced a modest but significant increase in local acetylcholine
levels (p = 0.002, t(10) = �5.27 for carbachol group; p = 0.008,
(10) = �4.43 for noradrenaline group), which reached wake levels
(p = 1, t(10) = 0.66 for carbachol group; p = 1, t(10) = 0.64 for
noradrenaline group) (Figures 2M and 2N). In a separate group
of 3 rats, we delivered a higher concentration of carbachol
(15 mM) into posterior parietal cortex to ensure that the concen-
tration of carbachol was not a limiting factor for the lack of
behavioral effects. The higher concentration of carbachol did
not produce any significantly different behavior from that
observed after 5 mM carbachol (data not included in this study).
Dialysis delivery of 5 mM carbachol into medial parietal asso-
ciation cortex did not produce any signs of wake-like behavior
(Figure 3A) but, similar to the effects observed in prefrontal and
posterior parietal cortices, produced electroencephalographic
activation, as evidenced by the transition to low-voltage fast
electroencephalogram (Figure 3B) and increase in the theta/
delta ratio (p < 0.001, t(6) = �6.36, compared to sevoflurane
anesthesia) (Figures 3C and 3D). Electroencephalographic
activation was accompanied by an increase in respiration rate
(p = 0.004, t(5) = �4.94) (Figure 3E); there was no statistical
change in heart rate (p = 0.05, t(5) = �2.57) (Figure 3F). Sevo-
flurane produced a significant decrease in acetylcholine levels
(p < 0.0001, t(7) = 12.25) in medial parietal association cortex,
which was not significantly changed or reversed by the local
carbachol delivery (Figure 3G). There was no difference in acetyl-
choline levels between wake and carbachol (p = 0.2, t(7) = 2.73)
or carbachol and recovery (p = 0.3, t(7) = �2.27) epochs.

DISCUSSION
These data demonstrate that, whereas cholinergic and norad-
renergic stimulation of prefrontal and parietal cortices can
activate the cortex, only cholinergic stimulation of the prefrontal
cortex restored level of consciousness and reversed the anes-
thetized state. These findings are consistent with recent work
in humans demonstrating a positive effect of prefrontal stimula-
tion on arousal in patients with pathologic disorders of con-
sciousness [10, 21, 22], and a long-standing hypothesis that
acetylcholine is a neurochemical correlate of the capacity for
consciousness [31, 32]. Furthermore, a recent electrophysiolog-
ical study postulated that the prefrontal prelimbic cortex in rat, as
was targeted in the current study, is a neural node in thalamo-
cortical (and possibly corticocortical) interactions that modulate
both the induction and emergence from propofol anesthesia [25].
Sevoflurane was selected for this study because it is commonly
used during human surgical procedures. Given the wide molec-
ular and pharmacological diversity of general anesthetics, it is
difficult to predict the outcome of similar experiments with
another anesthetic agent from a different class. However, previ-
ously conducted studies have been successful in reversing
propofol and isoflurane anesthesia by activating the ventral
tegmental area [7, 8], which suggests that targeting wake-pro-
moting nodes is a generalized strategy for reversing general
anesthesia that is independent of the anesthetic drug used.
It was unexpected that noradrenaline failed to induce any
behavioral change despite its known role in wakefulness [2, 3,
6, 9]. There can be several reasons for this unlikely finding. First,
this could simply relate to the pharmacokinetics of noradrenaline
and carbachol. Second, a recent study in rat barrel cortex
showed that cholinergic stimulation through carbachol infusion
during urethane anesthesia produced a tonic increase in firing
rates, whereas infusion of noradrenaline suppressed the overall
firing rate [33]. Third, a more fundamental reason could be that
noradrenaline activates the electroencephalogram and supports
wakefulness but is neither necessary nor sufficient for wakeful-
ness. This assertion is supported by a previous study showing
that the ablation of noradrenergic neurons did not have a signif-
icant effect on the time spent in the wake state [34].
Our study also demonstrated that cortical dynamics can be
dissociated from behavior, i.e., there can be an activated
electroencephalogram in the absence of wakefulness. Such
dissociation between electroencephalogram and behavior is
also known to occur after systemic administration of atropine
in rats, which show a slow-wave electroencephalogram in the
freely moving and apparently awake condition [35, 36], as well
as during rapid eye movement sleep, which is characterized by
wake-like activations of the electroencephalogram. Similar dis-
sociations between delta power—an electroencephalographic
feature of quiescence—and behavior have also been reported
during sleep restriction, immune challenges, dietary changes,
aging, and anesthesia [36, 37].
Sevoflurane is known to inhibit both nicotinic and muscarinic
receptors [38, 39], but based on our study we cannot distinguish
between the relative contributions of muscarinic and nicotinic
receptors in mediating carbachol-induced reversal of sevoflur-
ane anesthesia. In addition, even though dramatic carbachol-
induced increases in prefrontal acetylcholine and the simulta-
neous induction of wake-like behavior suggest a link between
the levels of cortical acetylcholine and wakefulness, our study
cannot rule out the possibility that the increase in prefrontal
acetylcholine levels was an epiphenomenon of the wake state.
Finally, we can only interpret these data in terms of the objec-
tively observable level of consciousness (e.g., signs of wakeful-
ness or anesthesia) and cannot comment on how prefrontal
versus posterior cortical areas contribute to the phenomenal
contents of consciousness.
Our study establishes the sufficiency of cholinergic stimula-
tion in prefrontal cortex for restoring the level of consciousness
in anesthetized rats. However, it does not exclude the possibil-
ity that the recruitment of additional brain areas, such as the
posterior cortical ‘‘hot zone’’ proposed to be important for
conscious contents [11, 16, 17, 20], could be required to
restore the complete spectrum of consciousness. Although
posterior cortical areas primarily represent sensory modalities
and are most likely candidates for the phenomenological
component of conscious experience, previous reports have
demonstrated a correlation between activity in these posterior
areas and improvement in the signs of consciousness in pa-
tients with disorders of consciousness [12, 15]. Nevertheless,
it is becoming more widely appreciated that levels and con-
tents of consciousness cannot be completely dissociated
[40], so these findings might ultimately be relevant to the
ongoing debate regarding the cortical sites that are critical for
conscious experience. Furthermore, the prefrontal cortex could
be a hub that regulates both level and content of conscious-
ness, because activity in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of
the nonhuman primate brain has recently been shown to be
critical for reportable contents of visual consciousness [41, 42].
In conclusion, these findings suggest that the prefrontal cortex
is capable of regulating the level of consciousness and reversing
the anesthetized state. The homology between rodent and hu-
man prefrontal cortex, and the well-characterized tripartite cir-
cuitry between cholinergic basal forebrain and the prefrontal
and parietal cortices [23, 24, 27], encourages further work to
develop a more precise understanding of the mechanism by
which the prefrontal cortex modulates level of consciousness.

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS
Rats
The study was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA), and
was performed in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (8th Edition, The National Academies Press,
Washington D.C.) and the ARRIVE guidelines [43]. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 60, 300-350 g, Charles River Laboratories, MA)
were used in the study. The rats were housed in a temperature and light (12 hr light: 12 hr dark cycle, lights on at 6:00 am) controlled
facility with ad libitum food and water.
METHOD DETAILS
Surgical Procedures
After anesthetic induction with 4%–5% isoflurane in 100% oxygen, the rats were positioned to breathe through a rat anesthesia mask
(Kopf Model 906) and immobilized in a stereotaxic frame using blunt ear bars (Model 963, David Kopf Instruments, Tujunga, CA).
Inhaled isoflurane concentration was titrated to effect - absence of pedal and palpebral reflex - during the surgical procedure and
was monitored using an anesthetic agent analyzer (Datex Medical Instrumentation, Tewksbury, MA). A rectal probe (Model
7001H, Physitemp Instruments, Clifton, New Jersey) was positioned to monitor the core body temperature and a small animal
far-infrared heating pad (Kent Scientific, Torrington, Connecticut) was used to maintain the body temperature at 37.0 ± 1�C. Subcu-
taneous buprenorphine (Buprenex, Reckitt Benckiser Pharmaceuticals, Richmond, VA) was used for pre- (0.01 mg kg-1) and
post-surgical (0.03 mg kg-1, every 8-12 hr for 48 hr) analgesia. In addition, a pre-surgical subcutaneous dose of carprofen
(5 mg kg-1) was administered to potentiate the surgical analgesia. A single pre-surgical dose (20 mg kg-1, s.c.) of cefazolin (West-
Ward-Pharmaceutical, Eatontown, NJ) was used as a prophylactic antibiotic. Stainless steel screw electrodes were implanted
through burr holes to record electroencephalogram from frontal (anterior-posterior: + 3.0 mm, medial-lateral: ± 2.5 mm), parietal
(anterior-posterior: - 4.0 mm, medial-lateral: ± 2.5 mm), and occipital (anterior-posterior: - 8.0 mm, medial-lateral: ± 2.5 mm)
cortices. A screw electrode was implanted over the nasal sinus to serve as the reference electrode. In addition, a CMA 11
microdialysis guide cannula (Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA) was implanted 1.0 mm above the prefrontal prelimbic cortex
(anterior-posterior: + 3.0 mm, medial-lateral: 0.5 mm, ventral: 4.0 mm) or 2.0 mm above posterior parietal cortex

 (anterior-posterior: - 3.60 mm, medial-lateral: 2.6 mm, ventral: 2.0 mm, angle of 40 degrees) or 1.0 mm above medial parietal asso-
ciation cortex (anterior-posterior: - 3.72 mm, medial-lateral: 2.2 mm, ventral: 1.5 mm). The rat brain atlas by Paxinos and Watson [44]
was used for the determination of stereotaxic coordinates and bregma was used as the stereotactic reference point. The free ends of
the screw electrodes were mated with a six-pin pedestal (MS363, Plastics One, Roanoke, VA), which along with the microdialysis
guide cannula was secured to the cranium using dental cement (Cat No. 51459, Stoelting Co, Woodlake, IL). At the completion of
the surgery, the rats were returned to their home cages and kept under a heating lamp until they recovered from anesthesia and
were ambulatory.
Electroencephalographic Recordings
Electroencephalographic signals from frontal, parietal, and occipital cortices were referenced to a stainless-steel screw electrode
over the nasal sinus, amplified 5000x, and bandpass filtered between 0.1-300 Hz using a Grass Model 15 LT bipolar physiodata
amplifier system (15A54 Quad Amplifier, Natus Neurology, Warwick, RI). A MP150 data acquisition unit (Acqknowledge software
version 4.1.1, Biopac Systems, Inc, Goleta, CA) was used for digitization (1 kHz) and storage of the electroencephalographic
data. Electroencephalographic signals from the ipsilateral frontal and parietal areas were digitally subtracted to generate a single
bipolar signal and divided into non-overlapped 10 s epochs. For each epoch, the power spectrum was estimated via Welch’s method
(pwelch.m function in MATLAB signal processing toolbox) and the theta/delta ratio was calculated as the mean power in the theta
(3.5-10 Hz) band divided by the mean power in the delta (1-3 Hz) band, which was averaged across the available epochs at each
studied state in each rat.
Reverse Dialysis Delivery of Carbachol and Noradrenaline
CMA 11 microdialysis probes (Cuprophane membrane, 0.24 mm diameter, 6 kD cut-off, 1 mm length for prefrontal and medial pa-
rietal association cortex, 2 mm for posterior parietal cortex; Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA) were continuously perfused with
Ringer’s solution (147 mM NaCl, 2.4 mM CaCl2, 4.0 mM KCl, 10 mM neostigmine; pH 6.0 ± 0.2) at a flow rate of 2.0 mL min-1. A liquid
switch (CMA 110, Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA) was used to switch between Ringer’s only and Ringer’s with either carbachol or
noradrenaline solutions. To prevent auto-oxidation of noradrenaline, the Ringer’s solution for noradrenaline also contained 10 mM
ascorbic acid and the solution was protected from light.
Acetylcholine Quantification
The changes in local acetylcholine levels after carbachol delivery were quantified using a high-performance liquid chromatography
(HPLC) coupled with an electrochemical detector. From each microdialysis sample, 22 mL was injected into a HPLC paired with an
electrochemical detector (Bioanalytical Systems, West Lafayette, IN). An ion-exchange (mobile phase: 50 mM Na2HPO4, pH 8.5)
analytical column (MF-6150, Bioanalytical Systems, West Lafayette, IN) separated acetylcholine and choline in the dialysis samples,
which were proportionately catalyzed into hydrogen peroxide by an immobilized enzyme reactor column (Shodex AFpak ACH-494,
Showa Denko America, NY). Hydrogen peroxide was detected by reduction (applied potential: 100 mV, Ag+/AgCl reference
electrode) at a dual glassy carbon (3 mm) working electrode coated (MF-1000, Bioanalytical Systems, West Lafayette, IN) with a
surfactant (CF-1075, Bioanalytical Systems, West Lafayette, IN) and peroxidase polymer (CF-1070, Bioanalytical Systems, West
Lafayette, IN). A seven-level acetylcholine-choline standard curve (0.05-1.0 pmol) was generated prior to each experiment and
was used as a reference for the quantification of acetylcholine levels using LC Solutions software (Shimadzu, USA). The microdialysis
samples from the noradrenaline experiments were analyzed using a Thermo Finnigan TSQ Quantum Ultra AM triple quadrupole mass
spectrometer equipped with an ion-max electrospray ionization source and coupled with a HPLC system (Waters Corporation). The
HPLC system contained a quaternary low-pressure mixing pump with vacuum degassing, an autosampler with temperature-
controlled tray, a column oven, and was equipped with a small-bore reverse phase HPLC column (Phenomenex Synergi 4 mm
Hydro-RP 2x54mm). The mobile phase ‘A’ was 10 mM ammonium formate with 0.15% formic acid and mobile phase ‘B’ was
100% acetonitrile. A six-level calibration curve for acetylcholine was generated based on analyte to internal standard area ratios
versus nanomolar concentration. The microdialysis samples were derivatized—prior to loading onto autosampler—using calcium
carbonate buffer solution (pH 9.2) followed by 2% benzoyl chloride with the final addition of 1% sulfuric acid solution containing
13C-labeled internal standard. Xcalibur software was used to control the HPLC and mass spectrometer as well as to generate quan-
titation reports.
Histological Confirmation of the Microdialysis Sites
After 3-7 days of completion of the recording session, the rats were deeply anesthetized with a combination of ketamine and xylazine
(80 mg kg-1 and 10 mg kg-1 body wt, i.p.). The rats were transcardially perfused with 100 mL of wash solution (phosphate buffered
saline: 0.1 M, pH 7.2; 1219SK, EM Sciences, Hatfield, PA) and 250 mL of a fixative solution (4% paraformaldehyde and 4% sucrose in
0.1 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.2; 1224SK, EM Sciences, Hatfield, PA). The brains were removed and stored in fixative solution for at
least 24 hr at 4�C, and then equilibrated in 30% sucrose in phosphate buffer at the room temperature. Coronal sections (30 mm) were
cut through the target brain regions - prefrontal prelimbic cortex, posterior parietal cortex, and medial parietal association cortex - on
a cryostat (Leica Microsystems Nussloch, Nussloch, Germany). The sections were mounted on slides and stained with cresyl violet to
confirm the location of microdialysis probe. Figures S1A–S1C shows the site of microdialysis in representative rat brain sections for
all three anatomical sites.

 Experimental Design
After 7-10 days of post-surgical recovery period and habituation to the experimental set-up, the rats were connected to the electro-
encephalogram recording system at least 30 min prior to the start of experimental session (9:30 am-10:00 am). A microdialysis probe
being continuously infused with Ringer’s solution at 2.0 mL min-1 was lowered into the target areas for reverse dialysis delivery of
carbachol or noradrenaline while simultaneously collecting local microdialysis samples for acetylcholine estimation: 1) prefrontal pre-
limbic cortex - 11 rats each for carbachol and noradrenaline groups, 2) posterior parietal cortex - 11 rats each for carbachol and
noradrenaline groups, or 3) medial parietal association cortex - 8 rats for carbachol delivery. The concentration of carbachol
(5 mM) was based on a previous study [27] and dose response experiments (n = 5 rats) in which we titrated carbachol (2.5-5 mM)
delivery into prefrontal prelimbic cortex to obtain the minimum concentration that produced electroencephalographic activation
and wake behavior; the data from these experiments were not included in the analyses. The same carbachol concentration was
used for posterior parietal cortex group. In addition, in a separate group of 3 rats, we delivered a higher concentration of carbachol
(15 mM) into posterior parietal cortex to ensure that the concentration of carbachol was not a limiting factor for the lack of behavioral
effects. The concentration of noradrenaline used in this study (20 mM) was informed by a previous report in which infusion of similar
concentration of noradrenaline into basal forebrain produced microarousals in rats under desflurane anesthesia [6]. Electroenceph-
alographic and microdialysis data were collected simultaneously and continuously but the microdialysis samples were obtained in
bins of 12.5 min as has been done in our recent publications [26, 45]. The first three data samples were excluded from the analysis to
avoid any possible confound associated with the insertion of the probe [26, 45] after which the baseline data under pre-anesthesia
wake condition were collected for 75 min. To keep the behavioral state constant during the pre-anesthesia baseline period, the rats
were kept awake by the introduction of novel objects and gentle tapping on the outside of the recording chamber. After the comple-
tion of 75 min of baseline wake condition, sevoflurane exposure (1.9%–2.4%) started and was titrated to produce unconsciousness
as assessed through the loss of righting reflex along with complete behavioral immobility. Sevoflurane concentrations were contin-
uously monitored using anesthesia monitors (Datex Medical Instrumentation, Tewksbury, MA) connected to the gas inlet and outlet
ports on the recording chamber. At the onset of loss of righting reflex, a rectal probe connected to a far-infrared heating pad (Kent
Scientific, Torrington, Connecticut) through a feedback temperature controller (Physitemp, Model RET-3) was positioned to monitor
and maintain the body temperature at 37.0 ± 1�C. In addition, a pulse oximetry sensor (MouseOx, Starr Life Science, Oakmont, PA)
was positioned on the foot or around the neck to record the changes in respiration rate, heart rate, and oxygen saturation levels. After
75 min of sevoflurane exposure, we reverse dialyzed either carbachol or noradrenaline for 12.5 min while the rats continued to
breathe the same levels of sevoflurane anesthesia (1.9%–2.4%). The sevoflurane exposure continued for an additional 50 min, after
which the anesthetic exposure was stopped. Thereafter, the recovery wake data during the post-sevoflurane period was collected for
37.5 min. The pulse oximetry data were excluded in some of the rats because of the lack of consistently reliable signals and were
analyzed in 1) 6/11 rats in carbachol-prefrontal cortex group, 2) 8/11 rats in the noradrenaline-prefrontal cortex group, 3) 9/11 rats
in both the carbachol- and noradrenaline-posterior parietal cortex group, and 4) 6/8 rats in the carbachol-medial parietal association
cortex group. We did not randomize carbachol and noradrenaline treatment because comparable behavioral response and cortical
activation was expected. The investigators could not be blinded to the experimental groups because of the clear differences in the
microdialysis guide cannula locations and the methodology for acetylcholine quantification: HPLC coupled with electrochemical
detection was used for the acetylcholine quantification in the carbachol groups while mass spectrometry was used for the noradren-
aline groups. Several of the experimental sessions across all experimental groups were videotaped and can be made available on
request to the corresponding author. The experimental design is illustrated in Figure S1D.
QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Statistical analyses were conducted in consultation with the Consulting for Statistics, Computing and Analytics Research unit at the
University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. We designed the study to have 80% power (at alpha = 0.05/6; Bonferroni correction for 6 pairwise
tests) to detect an effect size (difference in means divided by standard deviation of difference) of 1.2 or larger. The effect size of 1.2 or
larger was predicted based on a recently published, similar study from our laboratory [26]. Student’s two-tailed paired t tests were
used for all statistical comparisons using the programming and statistical language R v 3.3.1 (Studio Version 0.99.903 for Macintosh)
[46]. A p value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Multiple comparisons between acetylcholine measurements were
Bonferroni corrected. The respiration and heart rates were statistically compared 300 s before and 300 s after the visible change
in electroencephalogram following carbachol or noradrenaline delivery into target brain areas. For theta/delta ratio, electroenceph-
alogram segments (300 s) from the last epoch during sevoflurane exposure immediately before carbachol or noradrenaline delivery
was compared with the activated electroencephalogram segments (%300 s) immediately following carbachol/noradrenaline
delivery. The effect of carbachol or noradrenaline on acetylcholine release was assessed by statistical comparison of the following
epochs: 1) Wakefulness - last epoch from the baseline wake condition, 2) Sevoflurane anesthesia - last epoch during sevoflurane
exposure and before carbachol or noradrenaline delivery, 3) Carbachol - epoch representing the perfusion of target regions with
carbachol during sevoflurane anesthesia, 4) Noradrenaline - the presence of noradrenaline in the reverse dialysate interfered
with the simultaneous estimation of acetylcholine because of which the first post-noradrenaline epoch (devoid of noradrenaline)
during sevoflurane anesthesia was selected for acetylcholine estimation, 5) Recovery wake state - the emergence time from

 sevoflurane anesthesia was variable between rats but all rats recovered within 12 min of the cessation of sevoflurane exposure.
Therefore, the second post-sevoflurane epoch was selected for analysis. Acetylcholine quantification was conducted using two
different techniques: HPLC combined with electrochemical detection for carbachol groups and mass spectrometry for noradrenaline
groups. Therefore, to make the changes in acetylcholine levels in the carbachol and noradrenaline groups comparable, we have re-
ported the data as percent change from baseline in the main manuscript. Raw data for respiration rate, heart rate, and acetylcholine
levels, as well as the associated descriptive and inferential statistics are provided in the Tables S1–S3.
