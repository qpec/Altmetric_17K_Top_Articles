Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is the most frequent genetic cause
of renal failure. Here we identify miR-17 as a target for the treatment of ADPKD. We report
that miR-17 is induced in kidney cysts of mouse and human ADPKD. Genetic deletion of the
miR-17B92 cluster inhibits cyst proliferation and PKD progression in four orthologous,
including two long-lived, mouse models of ADPKD. Anti-miR-17 treatment attenuates cyst
growth
in
short-term
and
long-term
PKD
mouse
models.
miR-17
inhibition
also
suppresses proliferation and cyst growth of primary ADPKD cysts cultures derived from
multiple human donors. Mechanistically, c-Myc upregulates miR-17B92 in cystic kidneys,
which in turn aggravates cyst growth by inhibiting oxidative phosphorylation and stimulating
proliferation through direct repression of Ppara. Thus, miR-17 family is a promising drug target
for ADPKD, and miR-17-mediated inhibition of mitochondrial metabolism represents a
potential new mechanism for ADPKD progression.

 A
DPKD, caused by mutations of PKD1 or PKD2, is among
the most common monogenetic disorders and a leading
genetic cause of end-stage renal disease1–3. The clinical
hallmark of this disease is the presence of numerous renal tubule-
derived cysts. Excessive proliferation, a central pathological
feature, fuels the relentless expansion of cysts ultimately causing
end-stage renal disease.
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are non-coding RNAs that bind to
complementary sequences located in target mRNAs and inhibit
their expression4. Aberrant activation of miRNAs promotes
the progression of many common diseases5–8. Accordingly,
synthetic inhibitors of miRNAs (anti-miRs) have emerged as
novel therapeutic agents. Anti-miRs appear to be well tolerated
in human clinical trials9, have a long duration of action and
are efficiently delivered to the liver and kidney10,11. These
attributes make them an extremely attractive drug class for
diseases that primarily affect the kidney and liver and require
long-term
therapy,
such
as
ADPKD.
However,
whether
a miRNA-based therapeutics approach can be applied to
ADPKD is not known.
We
have
previously
shown
that
miR-17B92
inhibits
PKD1
and
PKD2
and
aggravates
disease
progression
in
a
non-orthologous
ciliopathy
(Kif3a-KO)
model
of
cystic
kidney disease12. However, the relevance of this finding to
ADPKD is unclear because whether miR-17 can modulate cyst
growth when Pkd1 or Pkd2 are already mutated has not
been studied. In fact, with the exception of miR-21 (ref. 13),
the role of miRNAs in ADPKD still remains unexplored.
Our primary objective was to identify miRNAs that play
a pathogenic role in ADPKD. We began by systematically
examining miRNA expression profiles in Pkd1-KO and Pkd2-KO
mice. Intriguingly, we found that among upregulated miRNAs,
the miR-17 miRNA family contributed most substantially to
the total dysregulated miRNA pool in both ADPKD models.
These unbiased microarray results and the previous observations
in the Kif3a-KO mice prompted us to study the role of miR-17 in
ADPKD. Using complementary genetic and pharmaceutical
approaches, we now show that miR-17B92 promotes cyst
proliferation and ADPKD progression. miR-17 mediates these
effects by reprogramming mitochondrial metabolism through
direct repression of Ppara.
Results
miR-17 miRNA family is upregulated in ADPKD. We used
Nanostring nCounter microarrays to compare miRNA expression
patterns between 10-day-old wild type and Ksp/Cre;Pkd1F/F
(Pkd1-KO)
kidneys,
and
21-day-old
wild
type
and
Pkhd1/Cre;Pkd2F/F (Pkd2-KO) kidneys (n ¼ 3 biological repli-
cates for all groups). Forty-five miRNAs were differentially
expressed in Pkd1-KO kidney, whereas 70 miRNAs were differ-
entially expressed in Pkd2-KO kidneys (Supplementary Table 1).
Twenty-nine miRNAs were dysregulated in both ADPKD models
(Supplementary Table 2). These dysregulated miRNAs exhibited
a correlated expression pattern (R2 ¼ 0.87) between Pkd1-KO
and Pkd2-KO kidneys suggesting that a common set of
aberrantly expressed miRNAs may underlie ADPKD pathogen-
esis (Fig. 1a–c).
To identify groups of upregulated miRNAs with the highest
pathogenic potential, individual differentially expressed miRNAs
belonging to the same seed family were categorized together,
and a cumulative fold change for each family was calculated.
Among the upregulated miRNAs, we focused on the miR-17
family because it contributed most substantially (42.7%) to
the total miRNA pool in both ADPKD models (Fig. 1a,b).
Quantitative real-time PCR (Q-PCR) validated the microarray
data and additionally demonstrated that miR-17 upregulation
correlates with disease progression in both models (Fig. 1d,e).
To
identify
the
precise
location
of
dysregulated
miR-17
expression, we performed in situ hybridization using a locked
nucleic acid (LNA)-modified probe against the mature miR-17
transcript. miR-17 expression was increased in cyst epithelia
of
both
Pkd1-mutant
and
Pkd2-KO
kidneys
(Fig.
1f).
miR-17 expression was significantly reduced in cyst epithelia of
Pkd2-miR-17B92KO
mice
(negative
control),
whereas
its expression was induced in renal tubules of kidney-specific
miR-17B92-overexpressing transgenic mice (positive control),
indicating that the in situ probe specifically detects miR-17.
The human mature miR-17 sequence is identical to the mouse
miR-17. Therefore, we used this in situ probe to examine miR-17
expression in kidney samples from normal humans (NHK)
and patients with ADPKD. Compared with renal tubules in
NHK, miR-17 expression was increased in kidney cysts from
patients with ADPKD (Fig. 1g). No signal was observed
when in situ hybridization was performed using a probe with
a scrambled sequence.
miR-17B92 promotes cyst growth in early-onset ADPKD models.
The miR-17 miRNA family aggravates cyst growth in the
Kif3a-KO ciliopathy model of PKD12. To examine whether
miR-17 plays a similar pathogenic role in ADPKD, miR-17B92
was genetically deleted in various orthologous ADPKD mouse
models. First, we deleted miR-17B92 in Pkd1-KO mice,
which develop an early-onset and rapidly fatal form of PKD.
miR-17B92F/F mice were bred with Ksp/Cre;Pkd1F/ þ transgenic
mice. The first and second generation progeny were intercrossed
to generate Ksp/Cre;Pkd1F/F (Pkd1-KO) and Ksp/Cre;Pkd1F/F;
miR-17B92F/F (Pkd1-miR-17B92KO) mice. Q-PCR analysis
showed that compared with control kidneys, Pkd1 expression was
equally reduced in both Pkd1-KO and Pkd1-miR-17B92KO
kidneys indicating a similar level of Cre/loxP recombination
(Supplementary Fig. 1A). In contrast, compared with control
kidneys, miR-17 expression was increased by 50.3% in Pkd1-KO
kidneys, whereas its expression was reduced by 51.9% in
Pkd1-miR-17B92KO kidneys (Supplementary Fig. 1B). We
observed a 50% improvement in median survival, 22% redu-
ction in serum creatinine levels, 26.8% reduction in kidney-
weight-to-body-weight ratio and decreased expression of kidney
injury markers Kim1 (down by 38.7%) and Ngal (down by 43.9%)
in
Pkd1-miR-17B92KO
compared
with
Pkd1-KO
mice
(Fig.
2a,b,d
and
Supplementary
Fig.
1D,E).
Moreover,
the number of cyst epithelial cells expressing phospho-histone
H3,
a
marker
of
proliferating
cells,
was
reduced
by
78.7% (Fig. 2c).
Next, we studied the role of miR-17B92 in Pkhd1/Cre;Pkd2F/F
(Pkd2-KO) mice, which with a median survival of B70-days
exhibit
a
relatively
less
aggressive
PKD.
Pkd2-KO
and
Pkhd1/Cre;Pkd2F/F; miR-17B92F/F (Pkd2-miR-17B92KO) mice
were generated using the strategy described earlier. Q-PCR and
western blot analysis showed that compared with control kidneys,
Pkd2 expression was equally reduced in both Pkd2-KO and
Pkd1-miR-17B92KO kidneys indicating a similar level of
Cre/loxP recombination (Supplementary Fig. 2A,B). In contrast,
compared with control kidneys, miR-17 expression was increased
by 45.4% in Pkd2-KO kidneys, whereas its expression was
reduced by 46.5% in Pkd2-miR-17B92KO kidneys (Suppleme-
ntary Fig. 2C). Compared with Pkd2-KO mice, we observed
a 149% increase in median survival, 31.8% improvement in
serum creatinine levels, 15.8% reduction in cyst index, reduced
Kim1 (down by 37.9%) and Ngal (down by 39.6%) expression,
and a 58.9% decrease in the number of proliferating cyst epithelial

 cells in Pkd2-miR-17B92KO mice (Fig. 2e–h and Suppleme-
ntary Fig. 2). Thus, deletion of miR-17B92 inhibited cyst
proliferation and disease progression in both Pkd1-KO and Pkd2-
KO models.
miR-17B92 promotes cyst growth in long-lived ADPKD models.
The majority of ADPKD patients do not experience a significant
decline in renal function until the fourth or fifth decade of
their life. However, Pkd1-KO mice develop a rapidly fatal
form of PKD; thus, this model does not fully recapitulate
the dynamics of human ADPKD progression. Therefore, we
evaluated whether miR-17B92 also influences disease progres-
sion in long-lived and slow cyst growth models of ADPKD.
We generated Pkd1F/RC mice that harbour a hypomorphic
mutation14 (mouse equivalent of the human PKD1-R3277C (RC)
mutation) on one allele and loxP sites flanking Pkd1-exons
two and four on the other allele15. We used Ksp/Cre-mediated

Figure 1 | miR-17 is upregulated in kidney cysts of mouse and human ADPKD. Nanostring nCounter microarray analysis was performed to compare
miRNA expression patterns between 10-day-old wild type (n ¼ 3) and Pkd1-KO kidneys (n ¼ 3), and 21-day-old wild type (n ¼ 3) and Pkd2-KO kidneys
(n ¼ 3). (a,b) The differentially expressed miRNA families in Pkd1-KO and Pkd2-KO are shown. The red circles mark Log2 fold change when only
differentially expressed family members are included. The stacked bars mark Log2 fold change when all expressed family members irrespective of statistical
significance are included. The values in parenthesis indicate the percentage contribution of each miRNA family to the total miRNA pool in cystic kidneys.
The miR-17 family is highlighted in red. (c) Dysregulated miRNAs exhibited correlated expression pattern (R2 ¼ 0.87) between Pkd1-KO and Pkd2-KO
kidneys suggesting that a common set of aberrantly expressed miRNAs may underlie ADPKD pathogenesis. (d,e) Q-PCR analysis demonstrated that
miR-17 is upregulated at cystic stages (P7 & P10 for Pkd1-KO and P21 & P28 for Pkd2-KO) but not at pre-cystic stages (P1 for Pkd1-KO and P14 for Pkd2-KO).
In situ hybridization (ISH) was performed using an LNA-modified anti-miR-17 probe. The kidney sections were counterstained with nuclear fast red to
mark nuclei. (f) Representative ISH images of kidney sections from wild type, Pkd1F/RCSKO, Pkd2-KO, Pkd2-miR-17B92KO mice (negative control) and
miR-17B92Tg (positive control) are shown. Expression of miR-17 (blue) was increased in cysts (cy) of Pkd1F/RCSKO and Pkd2-KO compared with renal
tubules of wild-type mice. miR-17 expression was abolished in cysts of Pkd2-miR-17B92KO mice, whereas its expression was induced in renal tubules
of miR-17B92Tg mice, indicating that the in situ probe specifically detects miR-17. (g) ISH was performed on kidney sections from four NHK and ADPKD
samples. Representative ISH images from one NHK and ADPKD sample are shown. miR-17 expression was not detected by ISH in NHK kidney sections.

Pkd1-exons
and
thereby
produced
a
compound
Pkd1-mutant
mouse
with a germline hypomorphic mutation and a renal tubule-
specific, somatic null mutation. To test the role of miR-17B92 in
this
mouse
model,
we
generated
and
characterized
Ksp/Cre;Pkd1F/RC (Pkd1F/RCSKO) and Ksp/Cre;Pkd1F/RC;miR-
17B92F/F (Pkd1F/RCDKO) mice. Pkd1 expression was unchanged
whereas miR-17B92 expression was reduced by 85.4% in
Pkd1F/RCDKO compared with Pkd1F/RCSKO kidneys (Supple-
mentary Fig. 3A,B). We prospectively monitored these mice
for 5 months by performing kidney MRI and measuring serum
creatinine levels at periodic intervals. MRI-assessed total kidney
volume (TKV) was reduced, and the renal function was markedly
improved in Pkd1F/RCDKO compared with Pkd1F/RCSKO mice
throughout the observation period, indicating that deletion of
miR-17B92 provided a sustained clinical benefit (Fig. 3a,c).
All Pkd1F/RCDKO mice lived well past 1 year, whereas the
median survival of Pkd1F/RCSKO mice was only 206 days
(Fig. 3b). We euthanize a separate group of 3-week-old and
5-month-old mice for molecular and histological analysis.
Kidney-weights, cyst size, Kim1 and Ngal expression, and the
number of proliferating cyst epithelial cells were markedly
reduced in Pkd1F/RCDKO compared with Pkd1F/RCSKO mice
(Supplementary Fig. 3C–H).
Finally, we examined the role of miR-17B92 in a slow cyst
growth model of ADPKD (Pkd1RC/RC) that harbours homo-
zygous germline Pkd1 RC mutations. Unlike the preceding three
ADPKD models, Cre/loxP recombination is not required to
induce Pkd1 mutation, and these mice develop significant renal
fibrosis. We generated and characterized 6-month-old Pkd1RC/RC;
Ksp/Cre and Pkd1RC/RC; Ksp/Cre;miR-17B92F/F mice. We
observed attenuated cyst growth, lower blood urea nitrogen
(BUN) levels, downregulation of Kim1 and Ngal expression,
reduced renal fibrosis and lower cyst epithelial proliferation in
Pkd1RC/RC; Ksp/Cre;miR-17B92F/F compared with Pkd1RC/RC;
Ksp/Cre mice (Fig. 3e–h and Supplementary Fig. 4).
Anti-miR-17 attenuates cyst growth in two PKD models.
Next, we studied whether miRNAs are viable drug targets
for ADPKD. Within the miR-17B92 cluster, we decided to target
the miR-17 family based on our observation that multiple
members of this family were upregulated in ADPKD models.
We have recently developed a chemically modified anti-miR
oligonucleotide
(anti-miR-17)
that
sterically
inhibits
the
activity of all miR-17 family members in cultured cells via
complementary base pairing16. We used the miRNA polysome
shift
assay
(miPSA)
to
assess
whether
this
compound
inhibits endogenous miR-17 in kidneys following systemic
administration. miPSA relies on the principle that an active
miRNA binds to its mRNA targets in translationally active
high molecular weight polysomes. Compared with vehicle,
a
single
subcutaneous
injection
of
anti-miR-17
displaced
miR-17 from high molecular weight polysomes in the kidney in
a dose-dependent manner. Similar miR-17 displacement was
not observed in mice treated with a control oligonucleotide
(Supplementary Fig. 5B and Supplementary Table 3). Moreover,
a 300 mg kg � 1 dose of anti-miR-17 did not produce acute liver
or kidney toxicity in mice (Supplementary Fig. 5C).
To evaluate the delivery and therapeutic efficacy of anti-miR-
17, we conducted randomized, blinded and statistically powered
pre-clinical studies in Pkd2-KO mice (Supplementary Fig. 5D,E).
We developed an antibody (anti-PS) that specifically binds to the
chemically modified phosphate backbone of anti-miR-17 to
determine its cellular distribution. Staining with the anti-PS
antibody revealed that anti-miR-17 was delivered to collecting
duct cysts even when administered
after numerous
cysts
had already formed (Fig. 4a). No anti-PS signal was noted in
kidneys of Pkd2-KO mice treated with PBS. To assess therapeutic
efficacy, we injected Pkd2-KO mice with 20 mg kg � 1 of anti-miR-
17 or vehicle at postnatal days (P) 10, 11, 12 and 19 and killed
them at P28. Kidney-weight-to-body-weight ratios, BUN levels
and Kim1 and Ngal expression were reduced in anti-miR-17-
treated compared with vehicle-treated Pkd2-KO mice (Fig. 4b–e).

 Moreover, similar to genetic deletion, treatment with anti-miR-17
also slowed the proliferation of cyst epithelial cells (Fig. 4f).
Next, we evaluated whether anti-miR-17 treatment demonstrates
therapeutic efficacy in a second, more long-term model of
cystic kidney disease. One-month-old Nphp3pcy/pcy mice, a well
characterized orthologous slow cyst growth model, were injected
with 50 mg kg � 1 of anti-miR-17 or vehicle once a week
for
6
months
(Supplementary
Fig.
5F).
We
found
that
kidney-weight-to-body-weight ratio and cyst index were signifi-
cantly reduced in anti-miR-17-treated compared with vehicle-
treated Nphp3pcy/pcy mice (Fig. 4g–i). Moreover, we did not
observe any major adverse effects of long-term anti-miR-17
therapy such as weight loss, failure to thrive or death.
Anti-miR-17 inhibits cysts in in vitro human models of PKD.
To assess the translational potential of our findings, we studied
the
effects
of
miR-17
family
inhibition
in
primary
cell cultures derived from human ADPKD cysts. These cells
were
cultured
to
measure
proliferation
or
in
vitro
cyst
formation in 3D Matrigel. Treatment with anti-miR-17 produced
a
dose-dependent
reduction
in
the
proliferation
of
cyst
epithelia from five human donors (Fig. 5a and Supplementary
Fig. 6A). In contrast, mock transfection or transfection with
three
different
control
oligonucleotides
had
no
effect.
Similarly, compared with mock or control oligonucleotide
transfection, anti-miR-17 inhibited in vitro cyst growth of
primary ADPKD cells in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5b,c and
Supplementary Fig. 6B).
c-Myc
promotes
miR-17B92
expression
in
PKD.
To
gain insights into the signalling events linked to dysregulated
miR-17B92 expression, we began by identifying PKD-relevant
upstream regulators of miR-17B92. We focused on c-Myc
because of its connection to both PKD pathogenesis and
miR-17B92 expression17–19. Chromatin immunoprecipitation
analysis showed that c-Myc binds to the miR-17B92 promoter in
cultured renal epithelial cells and mouse kidneys (Fig. 6a).
To study whether this interaction is functional in the context
of PKD, we first analysed mice with a gain-of-function allele
of c-Myc (SBM mice). Consistent with the previous report19,

Figure 3 | miR-17B92 deletion attenuates disease progression in long-lived and slow cyst growth models of ADPKD. (a–d) The role of miR-17B92 was
studied in Pkd1F/RCSKO mice, a long-lived model of ADPKD. (a) Representative MRI images and mean MRI-estimated TKV of 1-,2.5-, and 5-month-old
Pkd1F/RCSKO and Pkd1F/RCDKO mice are shown. TKV normalized to body weight was reduced in Pkd1F/RCDKO compared with Pkd1F/RCSKO mice at all time
points (n ¼ 8–10 each group, Po0.01). (b) Kaplan-Meier survival curves of Pkd1F/RCSKO (red line) and Pkd1F/RCDKO mice (green line) are shown. The

 c-Myc was upregulated, and SBM mice exhibited numerous
kidney cysts (Fig. 6b,c). Q-PCR analysis revealed that primary
miR-17 transcript (pri-miR-17) was upregulated by 9.3-fold
in SBM kidneys compared with control kidneys, suggesting
that c-Myc drives miR-17B92 transcription (Fig. 6d). To study
whether this regulation is also observed in ADPKD models, we
generated Pkd1-KO mice in which c-Myc was deleted (Fig. 6e).
Deletion of c-Myc resulted in a 53.7% downregulation of pri-miR-
17 expression, suggesting that c-Myc also promotes miR-17B92
transcription in the context of ADPKD (Fig. 6f). In contrast,
deletion of miR-17B92 did not affect c-Myc expression in
Pkd1-KO or Pkd2-KO kidneys, indicating that c-Myc functions
upstream of miR-17B92 in ADPKD (Fig. 6g,h).
miR-17 modulates mitochondrial function by inhibiting Ppara.
To explore the downstream mechanisms, we performed RNA
sequencing (RNA-Seq) analysis to compare mRNA expression
profiles between kidneys of 21-day-old Pkd1F/RCSKO and Pkd1F/
RCDKO mice (n ¼ 3 biological samples), and 21-day-old Pkd2-
KO and Pkd2-miR-17B92KO mice (n ¼ 5 biological samples).
Pathway analysis suggested that the primary cellular consequence
of miR-17B92 deletion in both ADPKD models was improved
mitochondrial metabolism (Fig. 7a and Supplementary Figs 7 and
8). Furthermore, upstream regulatory analysis revealed that gene
networks controlled by key metabolism-related transcription
factors
Ppara,
Pparg
and
Ppargc1a
were
activated
upon
miR-17B92 deletion (Fig. 7b). Next, we intersected the RNA-Seq

Figure 4 | Anti-miR-17 demonstrates therapeutic efficacy in short-term and long-term PKD mouse models. (a) Pkd2-KO mice were injected with
20 mg kg � 1 of anti-miR-17 compound or PBS on postnatal day (P) 21, 22 and 23, and kidneys were harvested on P26. Kidney sections were co-stained with
DBA (green, a marker of collecting ducts) and anti-PS antibody (red, antibody labels anti-miR-17 compound). Anti-PS staining was observed in collecting
duct-derived cysts (arrowheads) of Pkd2-KO mice injected with anti-miR-17 indicating that the compound was delivered to collecting duct cysts. No anti-PS
antibody staining was noted in Pkd2-KO mice injected with PBS. To assess the therapeutic efficacy of this compound, Pkd2-KO mice were injected with
anti-miR-17 or PBS at P10, 11, 12 and 19, and kidneys were harvested on P28. (b) H&E staining of kidney sections from 28-day-old Pkd2-KO mice injected

Figure 6 | c-Myc promotes miR-17B92 expression in cystic kidneys. (a) Chromatin immunoprecipitation was performed using an antibody against
c-Myc and control IgG. Semi-qPCR analysis of the immunoprecipitated DNA revealed that c-Myc specifically binds to the miR-17B92 promoter in
mIMCD3 cells and mouse kidney tissue. No PCR product was observed in IgG control. To assess in vivo functional interaction, c-Myc transgenic (SBM)
mice were analysed. (b) Q-PCR analysis showed c-Myc was upregulated and (c) H&E staining showed numerous kidney cysts in 6-month-old SBM
compared with control mice. (d) Q-PCR analysis revealed that pri-miR-17 was increased by 12-fold in SBM compared with control kidneys (n ¼ 3),
suggesting that c-Myc promotes miR-17 transcription in the context of PKD. To study whether c-Myc regulates miR-17B92 expression in ADPKD models,
Ksp/Cre; Pkd1F/F; c-MycF/F (Pkd1/c-Myc-KO) mice were generated. (e,f) Q-PCR analysis showing c-Myc and pri-miR-17 expression in 10-day-old control

also

compared

Western
blot
analysis
and immunostaining revealed that PPARa expression was
markedly increased in cysts of Pkd1F/RCDKO kidneys compared
with Pkd1F/RCSKO kidneys (Fig. 7e,f). Conversely, Ppara mRNA
and protein expression was decreased in miR-17 mimic-treated
compared with scramble mimic-treated mIMCD3 as well as
Pkd2 � / � kidney epithelial cells (Fig. 7d,f).
Ppara 30-UTR harbours an evolutionarily conserved binding
site for miR-17 and miR-19 families (Fig. 8a). To test whether the
binding
sites
are
functional,
we
co-transfected
mIMCD3
cells with a luciferase reporter plasmid containing Ppara
30-UTR and miR-17, miR-19, or scramble mimics (Fig. 8b).
Both miR-17 and miR-19 repressed Ppara 30-UTR. Deleting
the miR-17 binding site prevented miR-17-mediated, but not
miR-19-mediated, repression. Similarly, deleting the miR-19
binding site abolished miR-19-mediated, but not miR-17-
mediated, repression. Combined deletion of both binding sites
abrogated repression by both miRNAs.
Our results have shown that miR-17 and miR-19 directly
inhibit Ppara expression in cystic kidneys, but whether reducing

deleted
in
the

model.
We characterized 6-week-old Ppara � / �

(n ¼ 9)
and
Pkd1RC/RC;
Pparamut
mice
(n ¼ 6
Pkd1RC/RC;
Ppara þ / � and n ¼ 3 Pkd1RC/RC; Ppara � / �). Ppara � / � mice22
displayed

and
Pkd1RC/RC
mice
exhibited few (n ¼ 4 of 9) or no kidney cysts (n ¼ 5 of 9). In
contrast, all Pkd1RC/RC; Pparamut mice displayed numerous
cysts (n ¼ 9 of 9). Accordingly, kidney-weight-to-body-weight
ratio, the expression of Kim1 and Ngal, and proliferation
were
increased
in
Pkd1RC/RC;
Pparamut
mice
compared
with Ppara � / � and Pkd1RC/RC mice (Fig. 8c–e and Suppleme-
ntary
Fig.

Conversely,
we
tested
whether
increasing
Ppara expression attenuates proliferation and cyst growth.
First, using the in vitro MTT assay, we found that treatment
with
miR-17
mimic
increased
proliferation
of
cultured
mIMCD3 and Pkd2 � / � cells, whereas genetic (Ppara plasmid)
or pharmaceutical (WY14643) activation of PPARa abrogated
miR-17-stimulated proliferation of mIMCD3 and Pkd2 � / � cells
(Supplementary Fig. 12H). Next, to test the role of PPARa
in vivo, Pkd2-KO mice were treated with fenofibrate, a PPARa
agonist. Six littermate pairs of 18-day-old Pkd2-KO mice
were placed on a diet of standard chow or standard chow
supplemented with fenofibrate for 10 days. Fenofibrate treatment
increased Ppara expression in Pkd2-KO kidneys (Fig. 8g),
whereas
it
reduced
kidney-weight-to-body-weight
ratio,
cyst
index,
and
proliferation
suggesting
that
increasing
Ppara expression attenuates cyst growth (Fig. 8h–k).
PPARa regulates several aspects of metabolism including
oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS),
fatty acid oxidation
(FAO)23 and peroxisome
function10. Therefore, we tested
whether miR-17 affected these functions of PPARa. RNA-Seq
(Supplementary Fig. 9,10) and subsequent Q-PCR analyses
(Fig. 9a,b) showed that a large network of OXPHOS/FAO-
related PPARa target genes were upregulated after miR-17B92
deletion in both ADPKD models. To quantitatively measure
OXPHOS, we determined the real-time oxygen consumption
rate (OCR) of mIMCD3 and Pkd2 � / � cells. Treatment with
miR-17 mimics reduced basal and ATP-dependent OCR in
mIMCD3 and Pkd2 � / � cells. Moreover, re-expression of Ppara
normalized ATP-dependent OCR of miR-17 mimic-treated
mIMCD3 and Pkd2 � / � cells (Fig. 9g–i and Supplementary
Fig. 12). To assess mitochondrial metabolism in vivo, we injected
Pkd1F/RCSKO and Pkd1F/RC-DKO mice with a 3H-triolein tracer
and measured FAO24. Mirroring PPARa expression, FAO was
increased in Pkd1F/RCDKO kidneys compared with Pkd1F/RCSKO
kidneys (Fig. 9f). Reactive oxidative species level determined
by dihydroethidium staining was reduced, whereas the number
of peroxisomes assessed by the expression of PMP-70, an
abundant and integral membrane protein of peroxisomes,
was increased in Pkd1F/RCDKO compared with Pkd1F/RCSKO
kidneys (Fig. 9c–e). Finally, since miR-17 is upregulated, we
determined whether PPARa is downregulated in human ADPKD
cysts. Q-PCR analysis revealed that PPARa expression was
decreased in primary cells obtained from human ADPKD cysts
compared with NHK (Fig. 9j). Consistent with these results,
analysis of publicly available microarray data25 also showed that
PPARa and its target genes are downregulated in human ADPKD
cysts compared with normal renal cortical tissue (Supplementary
Fig. 13). Collectively, these observations suggest that miR-17
promotes proliferation in cystic kidneys, at least in part,
by
reprogramming
metabolism
through
direct
repression
of Ppara.
Discussion
The pre-clinical studies presented here indicate that miR-17B92
is a novel drug target for ADPKD. In support of this conclusion,
we
show
that
genetic
deletion
of
miR-17B92
attenuates
disease progression in ADPKD mouse models irrespective
of the mutated gene (Pkd1 or Pkd2), the type of mutation
(null
or
hypomorphic)
or
the
dynamics
of
cyst
growth
(rapidly fatal, aggressive but long-lived or slowly progressing).
In a complementary pharmaceutical approach, we demonstrate
that anti-miR-17 also slowed cyst growth in two orthologous
mouse
models,
including
a
long-lived,
slow
cyst
growth
model. Importantly, we show that anti-miRs can be delivered
to collecting ducts following systemic administration, perhaps
owing to the altered vasculature of cystic kidneys. This suggests
that anti-miRs are a viable new drug class for ADPKD.
These findings are likely to be relevant to human ADPKD
pathogenesis because inhibiting miR-17 also attenuated prolifera-
tion and cyst growth of primary human ADPKD cultures.
Since miR-17 inhibition slows cyst growth in ciliopathy models
(Kif3a-KO and Nphp3pcy/pcy), the beneficial effects of anti-miR-
17 treatment may also be observed in other forms of cystic kidney
disease
besides
ADPKD.
While
our
data
demonstrated
that administration of anti-miRs up to 6 months is feasible,
additional pre-clinical studies are needed to fully address the
long-term safety profile of anti-miR-17 therapy and to further
explore miR-17 as a drug target for PKD.
Figure 7 | miR-17B92 deletion results in improved expression of mitochondrial and metabolism-related gene networks. RNA-Seq analysis was
performed to compare mRNA expression profiles. (a) Top differentially regulated pathways in 21-day-old Pkd1F/RCDKO compared with Pkd1F/RCSKO kidneys,
and 21-day-old Pkd2-miR-17B92KO compared with Pkd2-KO kidneys are shown. (b) Ingenuity pathway analysis software was used to identify the upstream
regulators (URs) that may be responsible for the gene expression changes observed after miR-17B92 deletion in ADPKD models. Top 10 (based on z scores)
differentially expressed gene networks and their associated URs in Pkd1F/RCDKO compared with Pkd1F/RCSKO kidneys are shown. These networks were also
differentially regulated in Pkd2-miR-17B92KO compared with Pkd2-KO kidneys. Positive z scores (shades of orange) indicate activation whereas negative z
scores (shades of blue) indicate inhibition of the gene networks. The P values (shades of purple) represent the level of statistical confidence for the prediction
that the differentially expressed gene network is indeed regulated by the indicated UR. Large interconnected gene networks controlled by URs PPARa, PPARg
and PPARGC1a were predicted to be activated after miR-17B92 deletion in both ADPKD models. (c) RNA-Seq data were intersected with high-probability
miR-17B92 targets predicted by TargetScan. This analysis identified Ppara and 24 other common putative miR-17B92 targets in the context of ADPKD.
Expression of these genes was decreased (shades of green) in single knockout (SKO) compared with their respective control (Ctl) kidneys. In contrast, the
expression of these genes was increased (shades of red) in double knockout (DKO) compared with their respective SKO kidneys. SKO indicates either
Pkd1F/RCSKO or Pkd2-KO, whereas DKO indicates either Pkd1F/RCDKO or Pkd2-miR-17B92KO kidneys. The circles indicate predicted binding sites for the
various miRNA families derived from the miR-17B92 cluster. (d) Q-PCR analysis showing Ppara expression in the indicated mouse models or cell lines.

expression was increased in cyst epithelia of Pkd1F/RCDKO mice compared with Pkd1F/RCSKO mice. PPARa expression was decreased in mIMCD3 cells treated
with miR-17 mimic compared with scramble mimic. Error bars indicate s.e.m. *indicates Po0.05, ns indicates P40.05. One-way ANOVA, Tukey’s multiple

 Our studies point to pro-proliferative metabolic reprogram-
ming induced by the c-Myc-miR-17-Ppara signalling axis
as
a
potential
new
mechanism
for
PKD
pathogenesis
(Fig. 10). Quiescent kidney epithelial cells rely on FAO and the
highly
efficient
OXPHOS
pathway
for
ATP
to
maintain
homoeostasis23. However, rather than ATP, a more critical
limiting factor for proliferating cells is the amount of biosynthetic
intermediates available for DNA replication and synthesis of
new cell membranes and organelles26–28. Consistent with this
notion and similar to cancer cells, cyst epithelia appear to depend
on two alternative c-Myc-activated metabolic pathways of
glycolysis and glutaminolysis to fuel their proliferation20,21,29.
Our work suggests that an important additional component
of this metabolic re-wiring is the inhibition of FAO and
OXPHOS mediated, at least in part, by the miR-17-Ppara axis
(Fig. 10). By reducing OXPHOS, carbon can be shuttled to
alternate metabolic pathways to produce building blocks for the
formation of new cells30. Indeed Pkd1-mutant renal epithelial
cells exhibit reduced OXPHOS31. Moreover, PPARA and its
target genes are among the top downregulated networks in
murine and human ADPKD cysts25, further suggesting that
reduced FAO and OXPHOS contributes to cyst pathogenesis.
Importantly, mutations in FAO/OXPHOS and PPARA target
genes cause clinical disorders that are often characterized by
PPARA

Figure 8 | miR-17 aggravates cyst growth through direct repression of Ppara. (a) Human PPARA 3’-UTR PPARA 30-UTR harbours evolutionarily
conserved miR-17 (red box) and miR-19 (blue box) binding sites. Watson-Crick base-pairing between miR-17/PPARA 30-UTR and miR-19/PPARA 30-UTR is
shown. (b) To test whether these binding sites are functional, mouse Ppara 30-UTR was cloned into a luciferase reporter plasmid. mIMCD3 cells were
co-transfected with this plasmid and scramble (scr, black), miR-17 mimic (red) or miR-19 mimic (blue) (n ¼ 3). Luciferase reporter assays revealed that
compared with scramble, both miR-17 and miR-19 mimics suppressed wild-type Ppara 30-UTR. Deleting the miR-17 binding site prevented miR-17-mediated,
but not miR-19-mediated, repression. Similarly, deleting the miR-19 binding site abolished miR-19-mediated, but not miR-17-mediated, repression.
Combined deletion of both binding sites abrogated repression by both miRNAs. (c–f) To test whether reduced Ppara gene dosage is sufficient to enhance
proliferation and promote cyst formation, 6-week-old Ppara �/ � (n ¼ 5), Pkd1RC/RC (n ¼ 9) and Pkd1RC/RC; Ppara-KO (n ¼ 9) mice were generated and
characterized. (c) Q-PCR analysis showing Ppara expression in the indicated mouse models. (d) H&E staining, (e) kidney-weight-to-body-weight ratios and

whether increasing PPARa activity attenuates proliferation and cyst growth, 18-day-old Pkd2-KO littermates were fed a standard moist chow (Ctl) or a
standard moist chow containing fenofibrate (Feno), a Ppara agonist, for 10 days. (g) Q-PCR analysis showed that Ppara expression was increased in
Pkd2-KO mice fed Feno compared with Ctl. (h) H&E staining, (i) kidney-weight-to-body-weight ratios, (j) cyst index, and (k) quantification of proliferating

 cystic
kidneys32–36.
For
example,
patients
with
mutations
in CPT2, an enzyme that transports FA into mitochondria,
or patients with Zellweger syndrome, a disorder caused due
to
defective
peroxisomes,
develop
cystic
kidneys.
Glutaric
acidemia type-II, caused by mutations of either ETFA, ETFB
or ETFDH that collectively encode the OXPHOS enzyme electron
transfer flavoprotein, is also characterized by PKD. Interestingly,
Etfa, Etfb, Etfdh, Cpt2 and the various peroxisome genes were all
downregulated in both Pkd1 and Pkd2 mutant kidneys, whereas
their expression was increased after miR-17B92 deletion.
Another implication of our work is that agonists of the PPAR
pathway may also have therapeutic value in PKD. Several
previous studies have shown that treatment with PPARg
agonists (pioglitazone or rosiglitazone) reduces proliferation
and retards cyst growth in rodent PKD models37–40. We
observed
a
similar
beneficial
effect
of
PPARa
agonist
(fenofibrate) treatment in Pkd2-KO mice. However, a potential
limitation of these widely used PPAR pathway drugs is that
they cause kidney-related side effects. Pioglitazone can cause
fluid
retention
and
exacerbate
cardiovascular
symptoms.
Accordingly, whether lower-dose pioglitazone treatment can be
safely tolerated by ADPKD patients is currently being evaluated
in a clinical trial. Fenofibrate use is associated with an elevation
in serum creatinine and BUN levels41; therefore, whether
this drug can be used over the long term in kidney disease
patients is unclear.
In conclusion, miR-17B92 promotes ADPKD progression
through a new mechanism involving the inhibition of mitochon-
drial function. Importantly, miR-17 is a feasible and novel drug
target for ADPKD. Our pre-clinical work provides a strong
rationale for the development of a miRNA-based therapeutic
approach for ADPKD.

 Methods
Mice. Ksp/Cre42, Pkhd1/Cre43, Pkd1F/F15, Pkd2F/F15, miR-17B92F/F (ref. 44),
miR-17 transgenic mice45, Pkd1RC/RC (ref. 14) and c-Myc transgenic (SBM)46 and
Ppara � / � 22 mice were used in this study. The generation of the following mouse
lines is discussed in the results section: Pkd1-miR-17B92KO, Pkd2-miR-
17B92KO, Ksp/Cre;Pkd1F/RC (Pkd1F/RCSKO), Ksp/Cre;Pkd1F/RC; miR-17B92 F/F
(Pkd1F/RCDKO), Pkd1RC/RC; Ksp/Cre, Pkd1RC/RC;Ksp/Cre;miR-17B92F/F and
Pkd1/c-Myc-KO. For all studies, including the anti-miR studies, an equal number
of male and female mice were used. The mice listed above were maintained in the
B6 genetic background and their age(s) are indicated in the results section or the
figure legends. We have previously used Pkd2-KO mice to analyse miR-17
expression by Q-PCR12. However, all analyses reported in the current paper was
performed using new mice specifically generated for this project. All experiments
involving animals were conducted under the approval of the UT Southwestern
and Institut de Recherches Cliniques de Montre
´al Institutional Animal Care and
Use Committee.
Anti-miR-17 studies. Anti-miR-17 studies involving Pkhd1/Cre;Pkd2F/F (Pkd2-KO)
mice were utilized to determine the delivery and efficacy of the anti-miR-17
compound. Mice were randomly assigned to the treatment groups. All investigators
were blinded to the treatment groups until predetermined analysis was complete.
Based on our previous experience, power analysis (alpha o5% and power 480%)
was performed a priori to determine the sample size (N of at least 8). Nphp3pcy/pcy
mice (CD-1 background) were obtained from PreClinOmics (Indianapolis, IN).
Mutant mice were randomly assigned to the treatment groups. The investigators were
not blinded to the treatment groups. Animal experiments were conducted in
accordance with Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee guidelines via
Explora BioLab services. The experimental approach for anti-miR-17 studies is
shown in Supplementary Fig. 5.
Fenofibrate studies. Littermate pairs of Pkhd1/Cre;Pkd2F/F (Pkd2-KO) mice were
administered either standard moist chow or standard moist chow supplemented
with fenofibrate at a dose of 800 mg per day per kg body-weight for 10 days starting
at postnatal day 18. The calculated dose is based on a food consumption rate of
160 mg diet per day per kg body-weight.
Tissue harvesting and analysis. Mice were anesthetized under approved proto-
cols, blood was obtained by cardiac puncture, and the right kidney was flash frozen
for molecular analysis. The left kidney was perfused with cold PBS and 4% (wt/vol)
paraformaldehyde and then collected. Kidneys were fixed with 4% paraformalde-
hyde for 2 h and then embedded in paraffin for sectioning. Sagittal sections of
kidneys were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) or Pico Sirius red for
additional analysis. Cyst index (cystic area/total kidney section surface area) and
fibrosis area calculations (Pico Sirius red positive/total kidney section surface area)
were performed using ImageJ analysis software.
Renal and liver function tests. Serum creatinine was measured using capillary
electrophoresis and BUN, aspartate aminotransferase, and alanine aminotransfer-
ase were measured using the Vitros 250 Analyzer.
Human specimens. Frozen ADPKD and NHK specimens were provided by the
PKD Research Biomaterials and Cellular Models Core at the Kansas University
Medical Center (KUMC). ADPKD kidneys were obtained with the assistance of the
KUMC Bio-Specimen Repository Core. Kidneys were immediately sealed in sterile
bags, submerged in ice and delivered to the laboratory. Normal kidneys unsuitable
for transplantation were obtained from the Midwest Transplant Network
(Kansas City, KS). Informed consent was obtained. The protocol for the use of
surgically discarded kidney tissues complied with federal regulations and was
approved by the Institutional Review Board at the KUMC.
MRI imaging. MRI scans were performed using a 7T small animal MRI scanner
(Agilent (Varian), Inc, Palo Alto, CA) equipped with a 40 mm Millipede RF coil
(ExtendMR LLC, Milpitas, CA). Under anaesthesia by inhalation of 1–3%
isoflurane mixed in with medical-grade oxygen via nose-cone, the animals were
placed supine with the respiratory sensor, head first with the kidneys centred with
respect to the centre of a RF coil. MRI acquisitions were gated using the respiratory
triggering. The bore temperature was kept at 28±1 �C. Two-dimensional (2D)
scout images on three orthogonal planes (axial, coronal and sagittal) were acquired
to ensure the positioning. For kidney volume measurements, the high-resolution
T2-weighted fast spin-echo images were acquired on the coronal sections by
applying a 6 ms sinc pre-saturation pulse to remove the fat signal. Some of the
major imaging parameters were TR/TE ¼ 2,500/60 ms, FOV ¼ 32 � 32 mm, matrix
size ¼ 256 � 256 (affording 125 mm in-plane resolution), slice thickness ¼ 1 mm,
slice number ¼ 9–15 (dependent on the kidney size), no gap and number of
average ¼ 6.
RNA isolation and quantitative RT-PCR (Q-PCR). Total RNA was isolated from
cultured cells or mouse kidneys using miRNeasy Mini kits (Qiagen). First-strand
cDNA was synthesized from mRNA using the iScript cDNA synthesis kit
(Bio-Rad), and Q-PCR was performed using the iQ SYBR Green Supermix
(Bio-Rad). The Universal cDNA Synthesis kit from Exiqon was used for first-
strand synthesis from miRNA. Q-PCR was performed by using miRNA-specific
forward and reverse LNA-enhanced PCR primers from Exiqon. To measure
primary miRNA (pri-miRNA) expression, first-strand cDNA was synthesized by
using the iScript cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad). Q-PCR was performed by using the
TaqMan Gene Expression Master Mix (Life Technologies) and pre-designed
pri-miR-17B92 primers from Life Technologies. The samples were loaded in
triplicate on a CFX ConnectTM Real-time PCR detection system. 18S and 5S RNA
were used to normalize expression of mRNA and miRNA, respectively. Data were
analysed using the Bio-Rad CFX software. The sequences of the PCR primers
are shown in Supplementary Table 6.
miRNA microarray analysis. A nCounter Gene Expression CodeSet was
purchased from Nanostring Technologies. nCounter miRNA expression assays
were performed using total kidney RNA from Pkd1-KO and Pkd2-KO and their
respective age-matched littermate controls (n ¼ 3 biological replicates for all
groups) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
RNA-Seq analysis. Strand-specific RNA-Seq libraries were prepared using the
TruSeq Stranded Total RNA LT Sample Prep Kit from Illumina (n ¼ 3–5 biological
replicates for all groups). After quality check and quantification, libraries were
sequenced at the University of Texas Southwestern McDermott Center using
a Hiseq2500 Sequencer to generate 51 bp single-end reads. Before mapping, reads
were trimmed to remove low-quality regions in the ends. Trimmed reads were
mapped to the mouse genome (mm10) using TopHat version 2.0.12 with the
UCSC iGenomes GTF file from Illumina47. Alignments with mapping quality
o10 were discarded. Expression abundance estimation and differential expression
gene identification were done using edgeR48 or Cuffdiff version 2.2.1 (ref. 49).
Genes with a P value o0.05 were deemed significantly differentially expressed
between the two conditions. The identified genes were further subjected to
ingenuity pathway analysis to identify cellular pathways and regulatory networks.
In situ hybridization. 10 mm thick frozen kidney sections were immersed over-
night in 10% neutral buffered formalin. The next day, sections were washed with
PBS three times and then, treated with proteinase K for 10 min at 37 �C. Subse-
quently, miRCURY LNA-ISH FFPE protocol was followed. The tissues were

Figure 10 | The proposed mechanism by which miR-17B92 promotes
ADPKD progression. Mutations of Pkd1 or Pkd2 is associated with
increased expression of c-Myc. c-Myc binds to miR-17B92 promoter and
enhances its transcription in cystic kidneys. The miR-17B92 primary
transcript is processed to yield the individual mature miRNAs. In the
cytoplasm, the mature miRNAs (miR-17 and miR-19) bind to Ppara 30-UTR.
PPARa is known to regulate the expression of key metabolic genes involved
in mitochondrial OXPHOS pathway. miR-17 and miR-19 binding to Ppara
30-UTR lead to reduced Ppara expression, which in turn affects
mitochondrial metabolism in kidney epithelial cells.

 at 1:400 dilution (cat # 11093274910, Roche), and AP substrate was reapplied after
1 h. Slides were counterstained with nuclear fast red and then, mounted with Eukitt
mounting medium. Samples were allowed to settle overnight and then, examined
using light microscopy.
Immunofluorescence staining. The following antibodies and dilutions were used
on paraffin-embedded sections for immunofluorescence staining: anti-PS (Regulus
Therapeutics Inc, 1:1,000), anti-Ppara (Abcam ab8934, 1:200), anti-Pmp-70
(EMD Millipore ABT12, 1:200), anti-phosphohistone H3 (1:400, Sigma-Aldrich
H0412). Secondary antibodies were conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 or Alexa Fluor
594 (Molecular Probes, 1:400). Lectins used were Dolichos biflorus agglutinin
(DBA; Vector Laboratories, 1:400) and Lotus tetragonolobus agglutinin
(LTA; Vector Laboratories, 1:400). Tissue sections were stained as described43.
TUNEL assay was performed using the Promega Dead End Tunel Fluorometric
System Kit per the manufacturer’s directions with the following modification: the
proteinase K treatment time was extended to 15 min. Quantification of apoptosis
and proliferation was performed by randomly selecting 10 � 20 magnification
fields per sample and subsequently determining the percentage of positively stained
cyst epithelial cells. The person performing the quantification was blinded to the
genotype of kidney sections.
Western blot analysis. Total protein was extracted from kidneys or mIMCD3
cells. A total of 20 mg of protein was loaded on a 4–15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel
and the proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane
was blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin and probed overnight at 4 �C with
anti-Polycystin-2 (YCC2, gift from Stefan Somlo, 1:6,000), anti-PPARa (1:1,000) or
anti-PMP-70 (1:1,000) antibodies. Goat-anti-rabbit HRP-conjugated IgG was used
as a secondary antibody, and the blot was developed using the SuperSignal West
Dura Extended Duration substrate from Pierce. The protein bands were quantified
using Quantity One imaging software from Bio-Rad. Uncropped western blot
images are shown in Supplementary Fig. 14.
ChIP experiments. ChIP assays were performed using the ChIP-IT High
Sensitivity Kit (catalogue # 53040, Active Motif) or the EZ ChIP Kit
(catalogue # 17–371,EMD Millipore) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
Briefly, mIMCD3 cells or mouse kidney tissue were crosslinked with 1%
formaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature, homogenized into a single-cell
suspension and chromatin samples were extracted from the nuclei and sonicated.
Immunoprecipitation was performed with 5 mg of rabbit anti-Myc (sc-764; Santa
Cruz Biotechnology) and rabbit IgG (sc-2027; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibody
as a negative control. Genomic DNA was purified and amplified using the
following primer set: forward 50-AGGGCTCGTGGTTCTTAGGT-30 and reverse
50-GAAAAAGGGCAACCAGGACT-30. This primer set amplifies a c-Myc binding
site, which is B483 bp upstream of the transcription start site of the mouse
miR-17B92 cluster. Enrichment of c-Myc binding to the mir-17 site was compared
with the Input DNA (10%). The PCR product (145 bp) was visualized on
a 2% agarose gel.
Reagents. Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (catalogue#1960) and CellTiter
96 AQueous Non-Radioactive Cell Proliferation Assay (catalogue#G5421) was
purchased from Promega. DMEM low glucose medium (catalogue # 11885-084),
DNase I (catalogue # 18068-015), and Lipofectamine 2000 (catalogue # 11668-019)
were purchased from Life Technologies. miRNeasy Mini kits (catalogue # 217004)
were purchased from Qiagen. QuikChange II Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit
(catalogue # 200523) was purchased from Agilent Technologies. The following
miRNA mimics were purchased from Dharmacon, Inc (Thermo Fischer Scientific
Inc) - miR-17 (catalogue # C-310561-07-0005), miR-19a (catalogue # C-310563-05-
0005) and negative control or Scrambled (catalogue # CN-001000-01-05).
Cell culture. Mouse inner medullary collecting duct (mIMCD3) cells were
obtained from ATCC and grown in DMEM low glucose medium supplemented
with 10% FBS and maintained in 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 �C. Pkd2 � / � cells
were obtained from Steve Somlo and grown in DMEM:F-12 medium (catalogue #
10565-018,Gibco) supplemented with 2% foetal bovine serum, insulin (8.3 � 10 � 7
M), prostaglandin E1 (7.1 � 10 � 8 M), selenium (6.8 � 10 � 9 M), transferrin
(6.2 � 10 � 8 M), triiodothyronine (2 � 10 � 9 m), dexamethasone (5.09 � 10 � 8 m)
and recombinant g-interferon (10 units/ ml � 1, Sigma) at 33 �C50 Human primary
ADPKD cells were grown in DMEM:F-12 medium (catalogue # 10565-018,Gibco)
supplemented with 5% FBS, 5 mg ml � 1 insulin, 5 mg ml � 1 transferrin and
5 ng ml � 1 sodium selenite (ITS)(catalogue # 17-838Z, Lonza)50.
Proliferation assays. The following experimental protocol was used for the
proliferation assays that were performed in Supplementary Fig. 12G,H. For
PPPARa expression plasmid studies, mIMCD3 cells were grown in six-well dishes
(2 � 105 cells per well), and transfected with 0.6 mg of a Ppara expression plasmid
(pPpara) or Control (pCMX), along with 5 nM of miR-17 or scrambled mimic
(Scr). Two days after transfection, the cells were transferred to a 96-well plate and
incubated with 100 ml of the medium. For WY14643 studies, mIMCD3 or
Pkd2 � / � cells were grown at 37 �C, plated in six-well dishes (2 � 105 cells per
well), and transfected with 5 nM of miR-17 or scrambled mimic. The medium was
supplemented with 10 mM of WY14643 (dissolved in 70% DMSO/30% saline) or
vehicle (DMSO). Two days after transfection, the cells were transferred to a 96-well
plate and incubated with 100 ml of medium supplemented with 10 mM of WY14643
or vehicle. The MTT assay (Promega Corp) was performed after 24 h on mIMCD3
and Pkd2 � / �cells, according to the manufacturer’s directions. The quantity of
formazan product was measured by the amount of absorbance at 490 nm, which
is directly proportional to the number of living cells in culture.
The following protocol was used for the proliferation assays that were
performed in Fig. 5a,c and Supplementary Fig. 6. At 80% confluency,
human ADPKD cells were trypsinized using 1:10 dilution of Trypsin
(catalogue # 25-053-CI, Corning) in Ca þ 2 and Mg þ 2 free PBS. These
cells were transfected with anti-miR-17 and control oligos using RNAiMAX
(catalogue # 13778-150, Life Technologies) following the manufacturer’s protocol
at 2,500 cells per well density in a 96-well plate. Cell viability was measured using
MTT assay (catalogue# G4000, Promega) on day 3 following the manufacturers’
protocol.
Cyst formation assay. Human primary ADPKD cells were grown to 80%
confluency and trypsinized as described earlier. At day 1, cells were transfected
with the oligo of interest using RNAiMAX in a six-well plate format. Twenty-four
hour after transfection, cells were trypsinized to single-cell suspension, counted
and plated in a 96-well plate (cat # 353072, Corning) at 4,000 cells per well density
in 130 ml of media plus Matrigel (cat # 354234, Corning) in a 4:5 ratio. Upon
matrigel solidification, complete growth media was added to the well. Media
was replenished every 72 h until 8 days post plating when the cyst size and number
was measured. Each well was inspected for cyst proliferation using an Olympus
D8 light microscope. Images were recorded with an Olympus DP26 camera
(Olympus Corporation) from 28 focal planes, 150 mm apart, down into the well
(on the z axis) as twenty-eight 24-bit colour TIFF images at 2,448-by-1,920 pixels at
72 dpi. Each focal plane’s image from each well was processed using a custom
R script (R Core Team 2015 R: A language and environment for statistical
computing. R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria.
(URL https://www.R-project.org/) that used the EBImage Bioconductor package51.
This script detected cysts in an automated and reproducible manner and was
applied to all matrigel assays in all donors. Briefly, each image was masked for
artifacts, filtered through a high-pass Laplacian filter and segmented with an
adaptive threshold. Detected objects in the segmented images were further
processed by pixel dilation, hole filling and by pixel erosion. Size, radius and
eccentricity statistics on each segmented object were collected. Objects were filtered
out if they had a mean radius less than or equal to 15 pixels, or were of a mean
object radius greater than 200 pixels, or a coefficient of variation of the radius
of greater than 0.2, or if the eccentricity of the detected object was greater than
0.75. Because cysts were often larger than the distance between focal planes, it was
important to avoid counting such cysts more than once. If a cyst object in
one image fell within the same x and y coordinates of a neighbouring image
(for example, one focal plane above on the z axis), then this was counted as
the same cyst. All images in each well were processed sequentially in this manner
on the z axis. Finally, each cyst’s volume was estimated by multiplying the mean
radius of the largest object by 4/3pr3, assuming each cyst is a sphere.
miRNA polysome shift assay (miPSA). C57BL/6 mice (Jackson Laboratories)
were injected with a single subcutaneous dose of 0.3, 3 or 30 mg kg � 1 of anti-miR-
17, a control oligonucleotide or PBS. The kidneys were collected after 7 days, and
the tissues were processed16. The relative level of miR-17 in the polysome
containing fractions was quantified using the miRNA TaqMan assays
(Life Technologies). Let-7d was used as the reference gene. The relative
displacement of miR-17 normalized to let-7d was calculated between the treated
(anti-miR-17) and the control (PBS or control oligonucleotide) samples using
double delta Ct (DDCt) method. The displacement values are reported in log2 scale
where the positive values reflect the loss of miR-17 from the high molecular weight
polysome fractions.
30-UTR plasmids. 1456 bp of the mouse Ppara 30-UTR that includes the miR-17
and miR-19a conserved sites was PCR amplified using forward and reverse primers
that introduced NheI and XhoI restriction sites at the 50- and 30- ends, respectively.
The sequence of the forward primer was 50-TAGAATGCTAGCGCCACTGT
TCAGGGACCTC-30, whereas that of the reverse primer was 50-TAGAATCT
CGAGAGGCATCTACCACCATGTCC-30, where the underlined sequences are
the NheI and XhoI sites, respectively. The 1456 bp PCR product was ligated in the
pLightSwitch Empty (pLS) 30-UTR plasmid, that was previously digested with NheI
and XhoI restriction enzymes to generate the WT Ppara 30-UTR construct. The
seed sequences for the miR-17 and the miR-19 binding sites were mutated in the
WT-Ppara 30-UTR construct to produce the Ppara 30-UTR (D17) and Ppara
30-UTR (D19) constructs. The sequences of the primers used in site-directed
mutagenesis reactions are as follows-

The underlined sequences denote the respective mutated miRNA binding sites.
Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange II kit according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. The PCR protocol was as follows—1cycle at 95 �C
for 1 min, followed by 18 cycles of 95 �C for 50 s, 60 �C for 50 s, 68 �C for 6 min and
1 cycle of 68 �C as a final extension cycle. The presence of the desired mutations
was verified by DNA sequencing.
Luciferase assays. mIMCD3 cells were plated in six-well dishes (2 � 105 cells per
well) and transfected with 0.4 mg of pLS-Renilla-30-UTR plasmids, and 10 nM of
miR-17 or miR-19a mimic. Cells were transfected with 0.04 mg of the
pGL3-Control plasmid (Promega Corp) encoding Photinus luciferase to control for
differences in transfection efficiency. Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) was used as
a transfection reagent. Forty-eight hours later, the cells were lysed in 250 ml of
passive lysis buffer (Promega Corp), and 40 ml of the cell lysate was added to
96-well plates. Photinus and Renilla luciferase activities were measured by using
the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega Corp) according to the
manufacturer’s directions.
3H-triolein uptake and b-oxidation. Endogenous triolein clearance rates and
b-oxidation rates in kidneys were performed24. Briefly, 21-day-old Pkd1F/RCSKO
and Pkd1F/RCDKO were injected with 3H-triolein (2 mCi per mouse in 100 ml of
5% intralipid) after an 8-h fast. Twenty minutes later, mice were killed, blood
samples were taken and kidneys were collected, weighed and frozen at � 80 �C
until processing. Lipids were extracted, and radioactivity content was quantified.
Mitochondrial OCR experiments. Mitochondrial OCRs were determined
using an XF24 Extracellular Flux Analyzer (Seahorse Bioscience, MA) following
the manufacturers’ protocols. A basal-oligomycin-carbonyl cyanide
4-(trifluoromethoxy) phenylhydrazone (FCCP)-antimycin-A/rotenone ‘BOFA’
experiment was utilized for the assessment of mitochondrial function and
respiration rates in mIMCD3 cells. Pkd2 � / � or mIMCD3 cells were grown in
six-well dishes (2 � 105 cells per well). Pkd2 � / � cells were transfected with 0.4 mg
of a PPARa expression plasmid (pPpara) or Control (pCMX), along with 1 nM of
miR-17 or scrambled mimic (Scr). mIMCD3 cells were transfected with 0.6 mg of
pPpara or pCMX, along with 5 nM of miR-17 or Scr mimic. Forty-eight hour post-
transfection, Pkd2 � / � or mIMCD3 cells (60,000 per well) were seeded into an
XF24 cell culture microplate (Seahorse Bioscience). Cells were then equilibrated for
1 h at 37 �C (non-CO2) in XF Assay Medium (Modified DMEM, 0 mM Glucose;
Seahorse Bioscience) (pH 7.4), supplemented with 1 mM sodium pyruvate,
1 mM L-glutamine, and 7 mM glucose. The XF24 plate was then transferred to
a temperature-controlled (37 �C) Seahorse analyzer and subjected to a 10-min
equilibration period and three assay cycles to measure the basal rate, comprising a
3-min mix, a 2-min wait and a 3-min measure period each. Compounds were
then added by automatic pneumatic injection followed by assay cycles after
each, comprising of 3-min mix, 2-min wait and a 3-min measure period.
OCR measurements were obtained following sequential additions of oligomycin
(1 mM final concentration), FCCP (1 mM) and antimycin-A/rotenone
(10 mM/100 nM). OCR measurements were recorded at set interval time points.
The ATP-dependent OCR was calculated by subtracting the OCR reading recorded
after oligomycin treatment from OCR reading recorded at basal levels
((ATP-linked OCR) ¼ (basal OCR) - (post-Oligomycin OCR)). All compounds and
materials above were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich.
Statistical analysis. Data are shown as the mean±s.e.m. Statistical analysis was
performed using Student’s t-test for pairwise comparisons or Analysis of variance
(ANOVA) followed by Tukey’s post hoc test for multiple comparisons. Mantel-Cox
test was used to analyse differences in mice survival. Po0.05 was considered
significant. Primary outcomes (survival or renal function) in all mouse studies are
statistically powered to achieve an alpha error o5% and power of 480%.
Data availability. The RNA-Seq has been deposited in the NCBI Gene Expression
Omnibus repository under accession number GSE89764. Other data are available
