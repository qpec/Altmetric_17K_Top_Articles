Abstract
The effects of light on cognitive function have been well-documented in human studies, with 
brighter illumination improving cognitive performance in school children, healthy adults and 
patients in early stages of dementia. However, the underlying neural mechanisms are not well 
understood. The present study examined how ambient light affects hippocampal function using the 
diurnal Nile grass rats (Arvicanthis niloticus) as the animal model. Grass rats were housed in 
either a 12:12hr bright light-dark (brLD, 1000 lux) or dim light-dark (dimLD, 50 lux) cycle. After 
4 weeks, the dimLD group showed impaired spatial memory in the Morris Water Maze (MWM) 
task. The impairment in their MWM performance were reversed when the dimLD group were 
transferred to the brLD condition for another 4 weeks. The results suggest that lighting conditions 
influence cognitive function of grass rats in a way similar to that observed in humans, such that 
bright light is beneficial over dim light for cognitive performance. In addition to the behavioral 
changes, grass rats in the dimLD condition exhibited reduced expression of brain-derived 
neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the hippocampus, most notably in the CA1 subregion. There was 
also a reduction in dendritic spine density in CA1 apical dendrites in dimLD compared to the 
brLD group, and the reduction was mostly in the number of mushroom and stubby spines. When 
dimLD animals were transferred to the brLD condition for 4 weeks, the hippocampal BDNF and 
dendritic spine density significantly increased. The results illustrate that not only does light 
intensity affect cognitive performance, but that it also impacts hippocampal structural plasticity. 
These studies serve as a starting point to further understand how ambient light modulates neuronal 
and cognitive functions in diurnal species. A mechanistic understanding of the effects of light on 
cognition can help to identify risk factors for cognitive decline and contribute to the development 
of more effective prevention and treatment of cognitive impairment in clinical populations.

 Introduction
Environmental lighting conditions influence a vast array of physiological and behavioral 
processes in humans, i.e. circadian rhythms, alertness/arousal, as well as mood and cognition 
(Chellappa et al., 2011; LeGates et al., 2014; Vandewalle et al., 2009). The effects of light in 
regulating cognitive processes have been documented across diverse populations, with 
brighter illumination yielding improved cognitive performance. For example, brighter 
illumination in the classroom enhances the performance of elementary school students in 
math and reading (Barkmann et al., 2012; Heschong, 2002; Heschong et al., 2002; Mott et 
al., 2012); bright office lighting improves the performance of adults in the work environment 
(Baron et al., 1992; Mills et al., 2007; Viola et al., 2008) and bright light therapy has been 
shown to attenuate cognitive deterioration in mild/early-stage dementia (Forbes et al., 2009; 
Riemersmavan der Lek et al., 2008; Yamadera et al., 2000). However, the neural 
mechanisms through which light modulates cognitive functions are not well understood.
For diurnal species, including humans, light promotes alertness, which is essential for 
optimal cognitive function (Brainard, 2005). Humans receiving bright light exposure during 
the day have lower sleepiness and fatigue scores compared to those in a dim light condition 
(Ruger et al., 2006). Neuroimaging studies have shown that daytime bright light exposure 
instantly increases activity in the subcortical regions that support alertness/arousal even 
before affecting cortical areas involved in cognitive processes and performance (Vandewalle 
et al., 2006). Similar results are obtained when using blue-enriched light at a ~ 460nm 
wavelength (Vandewalle et al., 2007a; Vandewalle et al., 2007b), which is the preferred 
wavelength for the retinal ganglion cells that are responsible for non-image-forming 
photoreception (Do and Yau, 2010; Lucas et al., 2014).
Light also modulates human attention and executive functions involved in cognitive 
processing. Measuring brain activities using electroencephalogram (EEG), shows that 
daytime exposure to blue light increases the amount of attentional resource allocated to 
cognitive tasks (An et al., 2009; Okamoto and Nakagawa, 2015). Furthermore, bright light 
therapy has been used in patients with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, who show 
improvement in measures of both attention and executive function (Rybak et al., 2006).
In addition to the acute effects of bright-light exposure on arousal and attention, chronic 
changes in ambient lighting conditions can also produce long-lasting effects on brain and 
behavior. For example, laboratory rats housed in constant light during early development are 
resistant to the disruptive effects of constant light on circadian rhythms throughout their 
adulthood, suggesting that alterations in ambient illumination can lead to long-term changes 
in the brain (Cambras et al., 1998). Mice housed under different photoperiods or day-length 
over early development also show enduring difference in their dorsal raphe serotonin 
neurons, including their electrical properties and neurotransmitter content (Green et al., 
2015). In postmortem human brain tissue, the number of midbrain dopaminergic neurons is 
higher in those who died in summer compared to those in winter (Aumann et al., 2016). Our 
own work using Nile grass rats (Arvicanthis niloticus), a diurnal rodent species, shows an 
increased number of dopaminergic and serotoninergic neurons in animals that had been 
housed over 4 weeks under daytime bright light (~ 1000 lux) compared to those kept under

 daytime dim light (~ 50 lux) (Deats et al., 2015; Leach et al., 2013a). Based on these 
findings, we hypothesized that long-lasting changes in the brain, beyond temporary 
enhancement of arousal or attention, are likely to contribute to the superior cognitive 
performance associated with brighter illumination.
To test this hypothesis, the present study utilized the diurnal Nile grass rat and hippocampal-
dependent spatial learning/memory as model systems to explore the neural mechanisms 
through which ambient lighting conditions impact cognitive functions. Spatial learning and 
memory was assessed using the Morris Water Maze (MWM) task, which has been has been 
widely used in rodent species (Morris, 1981; Vorhees and Williams, 2006). Successful 
performance in MWM task has been shown to rely upon an intact hippocampus (Aggleton et 
al., 1986; Morris et al., 1982; Scoville and Milner, 2000) and is strongly correlated with 
hippocampal expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and dendritic 
plasticity (Conrad et al., 2012; Kesslak et al., 1998). Therefore, we focused our investigation 
on the hippocampus by examining its expression of BDNF and its dendritic spine 
morphology. The present study provides novel insights into the mechanisms responsible for 
the effects of ambient light on cognitive function, and has identified the grass rat as a useful 
diurnal animal model to further elucidate the underlying neural substrates for the behavioral 
effects of differential light exposure.
Experimental Procedures
Subjects
Male unstriped Nile grass rats (Arvicanthis niloticus) from our breeding colony at Michigan 
State University were used for all experiments. All animals were entrained to a 12:12 hr 
light-dark (LD, ~300 lux during the day) cycle and were given food (PMI Nutrition Prolab 
RMH 2000, Brentwood, MO, USA) and water ad libitum. All grass rats were group-housed 
prior to the start of the behavioral testing and then single-housed for the duration of the 
study in Plexiglas cages (34×28×17 cm), under either a 12:12hr bright light-dark (brLD, 
~1000 lux during the day) or dim light-dark (dimLD, ~ 50 Lux) cycle as described in our 
previous studies (Deats et al., 2014; Leach et al., 2013a). A PVC tube was provided in the 
cage as a form of enrichment and as a hut for the animals. All experiments were performed 
in compliance with guidelines established by the Michigan State University Institutional 
Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC), and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) 
guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.
Morris Water Maze
Three cohorts of animals (n=8/lighting condition) were used in this experiment. In the first 
cohorts, animals were housed in either brLD or dimLD for 1 week prior to being trained on 
the Morris Water Maze (MWM); while in the 2nd cohort, animals were housed in each 
condition for 4 weeks prior to MWM training. For the 3rd cohort, animals either remained in 
the colony condition (~300 lux) and then transferred to dimLD for 4 weeks prior to training 
on the MWM, or housed in dimLD for 4 weeks before being transferred to brLD for an 
additional 4 weeks prior to training. For all cohorts and conditions, during the last week 
before training, the animals were handled daily for 10 minutes to reduce novelty-induced

 stress that may stem from the experimenter’s handling of the animals (Leger et al., 2013). 
Handling was performed in the animals’ home cage in the behavioral testing room. Animals 
were trained and tested during zeitgeber time (ZT) 5–7, lights on was defined as ZT0; the 
light intensity in the testing room was ~ 300 lux. Training on the MWM was performed as 
previously described using a circular pool (60 cm depth × 122 cm diameter) with a platform 
(15-cm diameter) located 2cm under the water level and approximately 30cm away from the 
perimeter of the pool (Martin-Fairey and Nunez, 2014). The water was made opaque with 
non-toxic white tempera paint and kept at 26±2°C; different geometrical cues were posted 
up on each wall of the room for spatial orientation. Prior to the hidden-platform training, 
animals underwent a one-day cued-platform training, during which the water was clear and 
the platform was kept above water. This was done to ensure that any deficits seen during the 
hidden platform training were not due to impaired motor functions (Vorhees and Williams, 
2006). As a prerequisite, all animals included in the following experiments located the 
platform in less than two minutes when it was visible. For the hidden platform procedure, 
each animal completed two training trials per day over 5 days with each trial being a 
maximum of two minutes in length with an inter-trial interval of 30 seconds. If the animal 
failed to locate the platform at the end of the two-minute period, it was guided towards the 
platform, and given a latency score of 120 seconds. On the sixth day, reference memory was 
tested 24 hr after the last training session by removing the platform from the MWM and 
allowing each grass rat to swim for one minute to measure the following parameters: time 
spent in the goal quadrant where the platform had been located, swim speed, and 
thigmotaxis, i.e. time spent swimming next to the wall (Morris, 1984). All behavior videos 
were loaded into Noldus Ethovision (XT 8.5, Noldus Information Technology, Netherlands) 
and scored by a experimenter who was blind to the experimental conditions.
Immunohistochemistry (IHC)
Animals tested in the MWM were left undisturbed for two days before being used for the 
IHC analysis. Another group of animals that was housed under the same lighting conditions, 
i.e. 4 weeks of either brLD or dim LD, but without behavioral training/testing, was also used 
for the IHC analysis. All animals were transcardially perfused at ZT 5–7 with saline 
followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA). Brains were post-fixed and cryo-protected, then 3 
alternate sets of 40μm sections were collected using a cryostat. 10 sequential sections 
containing the dorsal HPC from one alternate set were processed for IHC using anti-BDNF 
primary antibody (1:5000, raised in rabbit, ab101747, Abcam, Cambridge, UK). The 
specificity of the antibody in grass rats has been verified in a previous study (Martin-Fairey 
and Nunez, 2014). The IHC procedures were carried out as described in our previous studies 
using 3,3′-Diaminobenzidine (DAB) and 4% Nickel Sulfate for colorimetric reaction 
(Adidharma et al., 2012; Deats et al., 2014; Leach et al., 2013a; Leach et al., 2013b). After 
the IHC reaction, sections were mounted, dehydrated/clarified and then coverslipped using 
Permount (Fisher Scientific, NH, USA). Photomicrographs of the dorsal hippocampus were 
taken using a CCD camera attached to a Nikon light microscope and analyzed using Image J 
(NIH) as described in previous studies (Adidharma et al., 2012; Deats et al., 2014; Leach et 
al., 2013a; Leach et al., 2013b). The number of BDNF-ir cells was determined for the CA1, 
CA3 and Dentate Gyrus (DG) subregions of the hippocampus with a 200×400μm counting 
box (Suppl. Fig. 1).

 Golgi staining
Behaviorally naïve animals were used in this study. Grass rats were housed in either brLD or 
dimLD (n=7/condition) for 4 weeks prior to transcardial perfusion (at ZT 5–7) with a 
phosphate buffer followed with a Rapid-Golgi fixative solution (modified from (Patro et al., 
2013)). Brains were post-fixed in the same solution for 24 hours, then transferred to 3% 
potassium dichromate for three days before immersion in 1% AgNO3 for eight days. Brains 
were placed in 20% sucrose for 48 hours prior to sectioning at 100 μm using a cryostat. 
Sections were processed through an ethanol dehydration series and were clarified with 
xylene. Sections were mounted onto gelatin-coated slides and coverslipped with Permount 
(Fisher Scientific, NJ, USA). For quantification, images of dendritic spines were captured 
using a CCD video camera (CX9000, MBF bioscience, VM, USA) attached to a light 
microscope using an oil immersion lens (Nikon Instruments Inc., NY, USA) and spines were 
quantified using ImageJ with the AnalyzeSkeleton plug-in (Ignacio Arganda-Carreras, http://
fiji.sc/wiki/index.php/). CA1 apical dendritic spines were analyzed from 20μm segments of 
four distinct dendritic branches per neuron, a total of six neurons were analyzed per brain 
(Pyter et al., 2005).
Spine morphology—Animals were housed in either brLD or dimLD for 4 weeks (n = 6/
condition) without behavioral training or testing (behaviorally naïve). They then received 
bilateral injection into dorsal hippocampus of herpes simplex virus expressing green 
fluorescent protein (HSV-GFP, Massachusetts Institute of Technology Viral Core Facility) 
(Rodriguez et al., 2008). 26-gauge needles (Hamilton Company, Reno, NV) were placed 
bilaterally at the following coordinates from bregma: −0.1mm A–P (anteroposterior); ± 2.0 
mm L–M (mediolateral); −2.7mm D–V (dorsoventral) from brain surface. Purified high-titer 
HSV-GFP (0.5μl) was infused at a rate of 0.1μl/minute, after infusions the needle rested at 
the site for five minutes prior to extraction.
After 48h post-surgery to allow for maximal GFP expression, animals were perfused 
transcardially with PBS followed by 4% paraformaldehyde. Sections were obtained at 100 
μm thickness and mounted onto subbed glass slides with ProLong® Diamond Antifade 
Mountant (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). For detailed morphological analyses of 
dendritic spines, samples were imaged on a Nikon A1Rsi laser scanning confocal 
microscope utilizing a 100× Plan Apo TIRF DIC-oil immersion objective (total 
magnification of 1,000x). To visualize GFP, the samples were excited with a 488nm laser 
and the fluorophore emission was captured by a 525/50 band-pass (BP) filter. A z-stack was 
obtained for each sample for dendritic spine analysis.
For each animal, five neurons (two dendritic segments/neuron) were analyzed. Z-stacks were 
were used to achieve three-dimensional reconstruction utilizing the NeuronStudio freeware 
morphometric program, which allows for accurate visualization and aids in reducing 
experimenter bias (Rodriguez et al., 2008). Dendritic spine density for the dendritic 
segments was quantified and grouped by subtypes (e.g. thin, stubby, and mushroom) based 
on neck length and head diameter. Thin and mushroom spine subtypes are classified as 
having visible necks with the major difference being that the head diameter of thin spines is 
not notably different from the neck diameter, while mushroom spines’ head diameters are

 clearly larger than their neck diameter. Stubby spines are characterized as having a large 
head diameter along with no neck presence (Bourne and Harris, 2008; Hering and Sheng, 
2001).
Data analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS (version 24, IBM, Armonk, North Castle, 
NY). For MWM behavioral data, the latency to reach the platform was analyzed using 2 × 5 
Mixed ANOVAs with lighting condition as the between–subjects factor and training days as 
the repeated measures factor for trials 1 and 2 separately. In the case that there was a 
significant interaction, Holm-method comparisons were used to evaluate group differences 
across all five training days; when there was no interaction, only main effects were 
interpreted. Two-tailed independent samples student’s t-tests were used to assess group 
differences on the amount of time spent in the goal quadrant, swim speed, and thigmotaxis 
(i.e. time spent swimming in the periphery not representative of a search pattern) during the 
probe tests. The number of BDNF-ir cells in each subregion (Suppl. Fig. 1) and dendritic 
spine density in CA1 were compared between lighting conditions using two-tailed 
independent samples student’s t-tests. The threshold for statistical significance for all 
analyses was established at p<0.05.
Results
Chronic daylight deficiency impairs MWM performance
For the first trial of each day, both groups kept under either dim- or br-LD for 4 weeks 
showed significant improvement in their performance (i.e., latency to find the platform) over 
the 5 training days, but the performance of the brLD group was superior to that of the 
dimLD animals (Fig. 1A; main effect of training days: F(4,56)= 16.493, p<0.001; main 
effect of lighting condition: F(1,14)=4.652, p< 0.05). There was no significant interaction 
between training days and lighting condition (F(4,56)= 0.953, p>0.05). That group 
difference was absent for trial 2 (F(1,14)= 1.377, p > 0.05), which was conducted 30 seconds 
after trial 1 (Figure 1B). By the last two training days, the majority of the animals 
successfully located the platform during training trails (Suppl. Fig. 2). During the probe trial 
when the platform was removed, the brLD animals concentrated the search within the goal 
quadrant, in contrast to the dimLD animals (Fig. 1C). Comparison of the time spent on the 
goal quadrant by each group showed a significant difference with the brLD spending more 
time on the quadrant than the dimLD group (Fig. 1D; t(14)= 2.98, p= 0.01). The 
performance of the dimLD group was not significantly different from chance (15 sec; t(7)= 
−.057, p= .956). The groups did not differ significantly with respect to swim speed (t(14)= 
0.002, p>0.05) and thigmotaxic behavior (t(14)= −0.76, p>0.05). In contrast to the animals 
housed in each condition for 4 weeks, identical testing of animals kept in brLD or dimLD 
for just one week did not result in group differences on any of the dependent variables 
(Suppl. Fig. 3).

 Impaired MWM performance resulting from daytime light deficiency can be restored by 
transferring to brLD condition
To determine if the impairments in spatial learning/memory due to light restriction are 
reversible, the animals initially housed for 4 weeks in dimLD were transferred to brLD and 
kept there for 4 weeks before testing. The transferred animals showed superior performance 
compared to those kept in dimLD. For trial 1 there was a significant main effect of training 
days (F(4,56)= 15.05, p<0.001) and housing condition on the latency to reach the platform 
(F(1,14)= 12.942, p= 0.003), with no significant interaction (Fig. 2A; F(4,56)= 2.38, p= 
0.062). Individual group comparisons showed superior performance for the animals in the 
reversal condition (i.e., dimLD-brLD) over those in the dimLD group for days 2, 4 and 5 of 
training. No group differences were detected for the latency data for trial 2 (Fig. 2B). During 
the probe trial, animals transferred from dimLD to brLD concentrated the search for the 
platform within the goal quadrant in contrast to the dimLD animals (Fig. 2C). The 
transferred animals also spent more time in the goal quadrant than the dimLD group (Fig. 
2D, t(14)= 4.387, p= 0.001). There were no significant differences in swim speed (t(14)= 
0.488, p>0.05) or thigmotaxis (t(14)=0.116, p>0.05) between groups.
Ambient lighting condition modulates hippocampal BDNF expression
BDNF-ir in the hippocampus was reduced in the dimLD group compared to the brLD group 
(Fig. 3A). The average number of BDNF-ir cells was analyzed in CA1, CA3 and DG. The 
number of BDNF-ir cells were consistently lower across the three areas for the dimLD 
group, although statistical significance was reached only for CA1 (t(10)= 3.05, p=0.012, Fig. 
3B). The data reported here are from animals that had been through MWM training. A 
separate cohort of animals without any behavioral testing was also compared for BDNF-ir 
(Suppl. Fig. 4). Similar results were obtained, with lower number of BDNF-ir cells in the 
CA1 of dimLD compared to brLD condition in these naïve animals (t(10)= 6.798, p<0.001). 
Similar to the behavioral reversal in MWM performance seen when the dimLD animals were 
transferred to brLD for 4 weeks, there was an increase in hippocampal BDNF-ir in the 
transferred animals compared to those kept in dimLD (Fig. 3C). A significant increase was 
observed in both CA1 (t(10)= 7.307, p<0.001) and CA3(t(10)= 4.183, p= 0.002).
Ambient light modulates CA1 apical dendritic morphology
In addition to BDNF expression, ambient light also modulates structural plasticity in the 
hippocampus. The morphology of Golgi-stained apical dendrites was analyzed in CA1 of 
animals from different lighting condition (Fig. 4). When the brLD and dimLD groups were 
compared (Fig. 4A, B), there was a significant reduction of apical dendritic spine density in 
the dimLD (t(8)= 5.103, p=0.001). Following transferring to the brLD condition (Fig. 4C, 
D), the dimLD-brLD group showed a significant increase in apical dendritic spine density 
compared to those kept in dimLD (t(10)= 10.062, p<0.001).
The morphology of apical dendritic spines was further analyzed using HSV-GFP expression 
in hippocampal neurons (Fig. 5). Examples of labelled apical dendrites from animals kept 
four weeks in brLD or dimLD are shown in Fig. 5A. Group comparisons of the abundance 
of different types of spines in CA1 found significant higher density of mushroom (t(9)=

 2.680, p< 0.05) and stubby spines (t(9)= 4.605, p=0.001) in the BLD group compared to the 
DLD animals, with no significant group differences for density of thin spines (Fig. 5B).
Discussion
We show here that in diurnal Nile grass rats, chronic conditions of ambient lighting can 
influence cognition in a way similar to that observed in humans, such that bright light is 
beneficial over dim light for cognitive performance. In addition, we found that lighting 
condition can modulate the level of hippocampal BDNF expression as well as structural 
plasticity within the hippocampus.
The Nile grass rat is a well-established diurnal rodent model that has been used in various 
research areas including circadian rhythms and sleep/arousal systems to show how the 
control of those functions differs from that of nocturnal rodents (Castillo-Ruiz et al., 2010; 
Gall et al., 2013; Gall et al., 2014; Nixon and Smale, 2007; Novak et al., 2000; Ramanathan 
et al., 2008; Schwartz and Smale, 2005). Because of the different, and often opposite, effects 
of light on diurnal and nocturnal species (e.g. light promotes wakefulness/arousal in diurnal 
animals including humans, but induces sleep in nocturnal ones), a diurnal model is of crucial 
importance for a mechanistic understanding how light modulates cognition in humans 
(Challet, 2007; Smale et al., 2003). Diurnal rodent models i.e. Mongolian gerbils, fat sand 
rats and Nile grass rats have been used for investigating the impact of lighting condition on 
brain and behavior in various lighting paradigms including total darkness, short-photoperiod 
or dim light exposure at night (Ashkenazy-Frolinger et al., 2010; Einat et al., 2006; Lau et 
al., 2011) (Fonken et al., 2012). The lighting paradigm used in the present study was 
designed to manipulate daytime light intensity while keeping the day-length or photoperiods 
constant. By having photoperiods remain constant, our findings aim to be more ecologically 
relevant to humans because, unlike animals in nature under sunlight, much of our living 
environment is comprised of artificial light. Therefore, we do not experience drastic changes 
in day-length, but rather variations in the quality of light i.e. spectrum or intensity (Hubert, 
1998).
After being kept in dim light during the day (dimLD) for 4 weeks, grass rats showed a 
deficit in the MWM task compared to the performance of animals kept under brLD for the 
same duration. The deficit was evident for both the first trial of each training day and for the 
probe test, in which the amount of time the dimLD animals spent in the goal quadrant was at 
chance level (Fig. 1). There were no group differences for animals kept in the two lighting 
conditions for just one week, thus suggesting that the detrimental effects of dim light 
develop over time (Suppl. Fig. 3). Further, since both groups were tested under identical 
intermediate lighting conditions, the superior performance of the animals in brLD for 4 
weeks is not due to the acute effects of bright light on performance, as has been reported in 
human studies (Knez, 1995; Riemersma-van der Lek et al., 2008; Royer et al., 2012; 
Yamadera et al., 2000). Swimming speed did not differ across groups; therefore, group 
differences are not likely to reflect deficits in motivation (Lubbers et al., 2007) or sensory-
motor functions (Vorhees and Williams, 2006). Even though dimLD housing has been 
shown to be anxiogenic for grass rats in the open field test (Ikeno et al., 2016), the lack of 
group differences in the display of thigmotaxis in the MWM suggests that the memory

 deficit of the dimLD animals is unlikely the result of enhanced anxiety during training/
testing. When the dimLD grass rats were rehoused under the brLD condition for another 4 
weeks, the animals performed significantly better than those in dimLD, suggesting that 
subsequent exposure to bright light can restore impaired spatial memory due to previous 
light restriction (Fig. 2).
Interestingly, the effect of long-term light restriction on latency to find the platform during 
training, was only significant for trial 1 of each day (Fig. 1A, 2A), suggesting that the 
retention of the memory for the platform location was impaired in the dimLD animals after a 
24 hr interval but not for the 30 second between-trial interval; a similar conclusion is 
supported by the results of the probe trial, which occurs a day after the last training trial. 
However, the effect of lighting condition on latency to find the platform was not significant 
for trial 2 of each day (Fig. 1B, 2B), indicating that exposure to the water maze on trial 1 of 
each day was sufficient to bring the performance of the dimLD animals to the level of the 
brLD group in the second trial 30 seconds later. In the MWM, working memory, which 
involves the prefrontal cortex (Jones, 2002), is engaged as the animal searches for the escape 
platform on subsequent trials of the same training day, whereas hippocampal-dependent 
reference memory is necessary for remembering the location of the platform from one 
training day to the next. Thus, the normal performance of dimLD animals on trial 2 may 
reflect an intact working memory and lack of dysfunction in the prefrontal cortex. 
Alternatively, the experience of trial 1 each day may reactivate a relatively weak reference 
memory (de Hoz et al., 2004), which then supports the normal performance of the dimLD 
animals on trial 2. Regardless of the possible explanations for the improved performance of 
the dimLD animals on trial 2, our results point to an inability to consolidate a robust 
hippocampal-dependent memory over a 24-hr interval. The results collectively suggest that 
long-term (4 weeks) light deficiency impairs consolidation of spatial memories, which is 
indicated by the rapid forgetting over a 24-hour interval displayed by the dimLD animals. 
This rapid forgetting of reference memory in the MWM has been seen in studies with other 
animal models of hippocampal deficits e.g., epilepsy (Barkas et al., 2012), and hippocampal 
insulin resistance (Grillo et al., 2015).
MWM performance has been linked to hippocampal expression of BDNF (Kesslak et al., 
1998), a member of the neurotrophin family of growth factors, which has been shown to be 
involved in learning and is crucial for long-term memory (Bekinschtein et al., 2007; 
Bekinschtein et al., 2008; Lu et al., 2008). Analyses of hippocampal BDNF expression and 
apical dendritic spines revealed a significant effect of ambient light on the structural 
plasticity of the hippocampus. Following 4 weeks of dimLD housing, there was a significant 
reduction in the number of BDNF-ir cells in the CA1 sub-region, compared to the animals in 
brLD and to those initially housed in dimLD then switched to brLD for another 4 weeks 
(Fig. 3). It is noteworthy that the brain samples from the two cohorts of animals i.e. 4 weeks 
in brLD vs dimLD (Fig. 3B) and 4 weeks in colony lighting (~300 lux) followed by 4 weeks 
dimLD vs. 4 weeks dimLD followed by 4 weeks brLD (dim-brLD, Fig. 3C) were processed 
for ICC separately, therefore, the results cannot be directly compared. Nonetheless, the 
differences between the dimLD and dim-brLD in the last cohort (Fig. 3C) appear to be 
greater than that in Fig. 3B when dimLD and brLD were compared. The greater differences 
in the last cohort (Fig. 3C) may due to the interaction between the lighting condition and

 prolonged (8 weeks) singly housing of the animals. Since these animals had been through 
MWM training/testing, the differences observed in BDNF-ir could have resulted from their 
housing condition, or alternatively, from their experience with the MWM, or the interaction 
of the two factors. Thus, we repeated the analysis in naïve animals. The results revealed a 
similar pattern with higher BDNF-ir in brLD as seen in the animals exposed to MWM 
training, thus suggesting that the difference in BDNF-ir was indeed due to the effects of the 
lighting condition and not the result of differential performance of the two groups on the 
MWM (Suppl. Fig. 4).
BDNF signaling modulates dendritic spine growth in the CA1 (Tyler and Pozzo-Miller, 
2003). The growth of dendritic spines in the hippocampus, particularly within the CA1 
region, has been linked to the formation of new synapses and improved learning and 
memory (Matsuzaki et al., 2004; Moser et al., 1994; Tsien et al., 1996). We found reduced 
CA1 apical dendritic spine density in dimLD animals compared to brLD and dimLD-to-
brLD groups (Fig. 4), suggesting a possible change in CA3-CA1 connectivity, a crucial 
circuit for spatial memory (Kodama et al., 2005; Marston et al., 2008). Following 4 weeks of 
rehousing the dimLD group in the brLD condition, we found a significant increase in both 
BDNF-ir and dendritic spine density in the hippocampus. These findings indicate restored 
hippocampal function underlies the improvement of MWM performance of animals under 
the same lighting regimen (Fig. 2). It should be noted that the animals in the present study 
were all young adults (4–6 months old). Whether this level of plasticity is retained in older 
animals and how aging may impact the modulatory effects of light on hippocampal function 
requires further investigation.
It has been proposed that most excitatory synapses are located at dendritic spines (Harris, 
1999; Matus, 2000), and their retraction or generation may underlie the neural mechanisms 
for learning and memory (Segal, 2017). A more detailed morphometric analysis on CA1 
apical dendritic segments revealed a significant reduction of stubby and mushroom spines in 
dimLD compared to the brLD group (Fig. 5). Various studies demonstrate that after tetanic 
stimulation or behavioral training engaging the hippocampus, the spine apparatus prevalent 
in mushroom spines (Spacek and Harris, 1997) recruits a wide array of molecules that 
enhance synaptic plasticity (Engert and Bonhoeffer, 1999; Matsuo et al., 2008; Ostroff et al., 
2002). Therefore, the observed lower number of CA1 mushroom spines may reflect a 
degradation of synaptic plasticity that is correlated with impaired performance in the MWM. 
The changes in BDNF expression, dendritic spine density, as well as spine morphology 
within the CA1, collectively suggest that ambient light modulates structural plasticity in the 
hippocampus.
The functional and structural changes in the hippocampus support the hypothesis that long-
lasting changes in the brain, beyond temporary enhancement of arousal or attention, 
contribute to the superior cognitive performance associated with brighter illumination. 
Consistent with this hypothesis, seasonal variation has been reported in human cognitive 
brain responses, measured by P300 event-related brain potentials (Kosmidis et al., 1998; 
Polich and Geisler, 1991) and fMRI (Meyer et al., 2016). And the P300 amplitude has been 
shown to be influenced by seasonal variation in the available amount of sunshine (Polich and 
Geisler, 1991). Enhanced cognitive function by light has traditionally been explained in

 reference to sleep and circadian rhythms (Chellappa et al., 2011), and sleep and circadian 
regulation certainly play a role in memory and hippocampal functions (Smarr et al., 2014; 
Walker and Stickgold, 2006). However, lighting conditions can also influence learning/
memory through circadian-independent mechanisms likely to involve melanopsin-based 
photoreception (LeGates et al., 2014). Our results provide evidence that lighting condition 
modulates the functional connectivity of the neural circuit within the hippocampus. More 
work is required to further elucidate the neural pathways mediating the effects of ambient 
light on the hippocampus. A possible candidate would be the hypothalamic orexin/
hypocretin neurons, which have been implicated in many important functions including 
wakefulness, energy homeostasis, emotion and cognition (Gerashchenko and Shiromani, 
2004; Tsujino and Sakurai, 2009). Our previous work in grass rats has shown that the 
number of orexin-ir neurons and the density of orexin-ir fibers are affected by lighting 
conditions, with higher levels of orexin-ir in brLD than in dimLD groups (Deats et al., 
2014); and orexin pathways mediate the effects of light on other brain regions, i.e. the dorsal 
raphe (Adidharma et al., 2012) and hypothalamic dopaminergic neurons (Deats et al., 2015). 
Orexinergic cells project directly to the hippocampus in both nocturnal laboratory rats and 
diurnal grass rats (Nixon and Smale, 2007; Peyron et al., 1998). Thus, the orexin system is 
well positioned to mediate the effects of light on hippocampal-dependent learning and 
memory, an idea that will be further explored in future studies.
The present study is a first step towards a better understanding of how ambient light 
modulates cognitive functions in diurnal species. Such knowledge is significant for the 
design of lighting environments that promote optimal cognitive function. In the United 
States, a majority of the population spends ~90% of their time indoors, where the lighting is 
less bright than outdoors (Klepeis et al., 2001). Even in optimal environments, light 
deficiency can occur as a result of reduced ocular transmission related to retinal disease or 
aging (Chen et al., 2013; Coleman et al., 2008; de Zavalia et al., 2011; Fernandez et al., 
2013; Higuchi et al., 2013). Although light pollution or light exposure at night has recently 
been recognized as a negative factor for ecology and human health (Chepesiuk, 2009; Falchi 
et al., 2011), the consequence of insufficient light during the day has received less attention. 
Our finding that 4 weeks of daytime light deficiency leads to a reduction in the functional 
connectivity within the hippocampus and to impairments in spatial learning and memory 
underscore the salient effects of light on our brain and behavior. A mechanistic 
understanding of the effects of light on cognition can help to identify risk factors for 
cognitive decline and contribute to the development of more effective prevention and 
treatment of cognitive impairment in clinical populations.

Impaired MWM performance of grass rats housed in dimLD compared to those in brLD 
condition over 4 weeks. (A) Latency of animals to locate the platform during trial 1 (24-hour 
delay) over the 5 training days. Grass rats housed in brLD were able to locate the platform 
significantly faster in the than those housed in dimLD (main effect of training days: F(4,56)= 
16.493, p<0.001; main effect of lighting condition: F(1,14)=4.652, p< 0.05); interaction 
between training days and lighting condition (F(4,56)= 0.953, p>0.05). (B) Latency of 
animals to locate the platform during trial 2 (30-second delay), there were no significant 
differences between the two groups. (C) Representative track plots of a grass rat in each 
lighting condition during the probe trial (with goal quadrant highlighted). (D). Grass rats 
housed in brLD nearly spent twice as much amount of time searching for the platform in the 
goal quadrant in the probe test when compared to grass rats in the dimLD group. *, p < 0.05.
