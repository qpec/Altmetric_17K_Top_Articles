OBJECTIVES: To investigate the associations between
objective and subjective measures of oral health and inci-
dent physical frailty.
DESIGN: Cross-sectional
and
longitudinal
study
with
3 years of follow-up using data from the British Regional
Heart Study.
SETTING: General practices in 24 British towns.
PARTICIPANTS: Community-dwelling men aged 71 to
92 (N = 1,622).
MEASUREMENTS: Objective assessments of oral health
included tooth count and periodontal disease. Self-reported
oral health measures included overall self-rated oral health; dry
mouth symptoms; sensitivity to hot, cold, and sweet; and
perceived difficulty eating. Frailty was defined using the Fried
phenotype as having 3 or more of weight loss, grip strength,
exhaustion, slow walking speed, and low physical activity. Inci-
dent frailty was assessed after 3 years of follow-up in 2014.
RESULTS: Three hundred three (19%) men were frail at
baseline (aged 71–92). Having fewer than 21 teeth, com-
plete tooth loss, fair to poor self-rated oral health, difficulty
eating, dry mouth, and more oral health problems were
associated with greater likelihood of being frail. Of 1,284
men followed for 3 years, 107 (10%) became frail. The risk
of incident frailty was higher in participants who were
edentulous (odds ratio (OR) = 1.90, 95% confidence inter-
val (CI) = 1.03–3.52); had 3 or more dry mouth symptoms
(OR = 2.03, 95% CI = 1.18–3.48); and had 1 (OR = 2.34,
95% CI = 1.18–4.64), 2 (OR = 2.30, 95% CI = 1.09–
4.84), or 3 or more (OR = 2.72, 95% CI = 1.11–6.64) oral
health problems after adjustment for age, smoking, social
class, history of cardiovascular disease or diabetes mellitus,
and medications related to dry mouth.
CONCLUSION: The presence of oral health problems
was associated with greater risks of being frail and develop-
ing frailty in older age. The identification and management
of poor oral health in older people could be important in
preventing frailty. J Am Geriatr Soc 0:1–7, 2017.

T
he United Kingdom, in common with many other
developed countries, is undergoing rapid demographic
changes, with dramatic increases in the number of older
adults. The numbers of people aged 65 and older and 85
and older in England and Wales are projected to increase
by 25% and 50%, respectively, by 2033.1 The health and
well-being of older adults is therefore a public health pri-
ority. Oral health problems are widely prevalent health
conditions in older adults, and with population aging, the
global burden of oral health problems has increased over
the last 20 years.2 Oral health problems in older people
include excessive tooth loss, periodontal (gum) disease,
dental caries (decay), and perceived dry mouth. In the Uni-
ted Kingdom, more than 60% of older adults have peri-
odontal disease, only approximately 40% have functional
dentition (defined as ≥21 teeth), and more than one-third
have dry mouth.3,4 These oral health problems have signif-
icant effects on eating and swallowing, nutritional intake,
speaking, and smiling and thus affect several aspects of
health and well-being.5 Tooth loss and periodontal disease
are also found to be associated with greater risks of mor-
bidity, physical and cognitive decline, and mortality.6–8

 Studies suggest that poor oral health is also associated
with greater risk of frailty, which is a major healthcare
challenge in aging populations.9,10 Frailty is a state of vul-
nerability in older age to adverse outcomes including func-
tional decline, hospitalization, disability, long-term care,
and death.10,11 Although an association has been found
between poor oral health (e.g., tooth loss) and frailty, stud-
ies so far mostly have few oral health measures (typically,
presence or absence of teeth) in relation to individual
aspects of frailty, and have mostly been cross-sectional.9
Three previous studies with a composite measure of frailty
investigating associations with oral health were cross-
sectional.12–14 One recent study of 237 older Mexican
adults investigated the prospective association between oral
health and frailty and found tooth loss and periodontal dis-
ease to be associated with greater risk of incident frailty.15
Further studies in different and larger study populations
are needed to corroborate and establish the influence of
oral health longitudinally on the development of frailty.
Such investigations are needed to identify the role of oral
health in reducing the burden of frailty in older age. In a
unique national study comprising a sample of community-
dwelling British men aged 71 to 92, we prospectively inves-
tigated whether objective and subjective oral health mea-
sures are associated with frailty over 3 years of follow-up.
We also examined whether these associations were inde-
pendent of smoking, socioeconomic position, and history
of cardiovascular disease and diabetes.
METHODS
The British Regional Heart Study (BRHS) is a prospective
cohort comprising a socially and geographically representa-
tive sample of 7,735 British men recruited from general prac-
tices in 24 towns across Britain initially examined in 1978 to
1980 at age 40 to 59.16 From 2010 to 2012, all surviving men
then aged 71 to 92 were invited to attend a reexamination.
All relevant local research ethics committees provided ethical
approval. All men provided written informed consent to
participate in the investigations, which were conducted in
accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Participants
(N = 1,722) underwent a physical examination including
anthropometric measurements (height, weight, waist circum-
ference) and physical performance assessments including a
walking test (time taken, in seconds, to walk 3 m at normal
walking pace), and grip strength hydraulic hand dynamome-
ter (Jamar Hydraulic Hand Dynamometer Model J00105).16
Grip strength was measured 3 times for each hand, and the
best of 6 readings was used for the analysis. Participants also
completed a questionnaire at the time of examination or by
mail if they did not attend (n = 2,147) that included informa-
tion such as their medical history and lifestyle factors. In
2014, a postal questionnaire with medical, social, and health-
related questions was sent to participants as part of the on-
going follow-up of the study. The investigations in the present
study are based on the assessments made at age 71 to 92 in
2010–12, with follow-up until 2014.
Oral Health Markers
The physical examination at age 71 to 92 in 2010–12
included an oral health assessment comprising a count of
natural teeth and two measures of periodontal conditions
on 6 index teeth (three in the upper and three in the lower
jaw)—periodontal pocket depth (the gap between gums
and tooth) and loss of attachment (the distance between
the point at which the gum is attached and the “neck” of
the tooth where the gum is attached in a healthy tooth).17
Questionnaires included questions on self-reported oral
health measures, including overall self-rated oral health
(excellent, good, or fair to poor);18 dry mouth (based on
the validated Xerostomia Inventory Scale);19 sensitivity to
hot, cold, and sweet; and difficulty eating food.
Frailty
Frailty status at age 71 to 92 in 2010–12 was based on the
Fried frailty phenotype using data from both question-
naires and the physical assessment.11,20 This included unin-
tentional weight loss (assessed as ≥5% decrease in self-
reported weight that was reported to be unintentional);
exhaustion (response of “no” to question “Do you feel full
of energy?”); weakness (assessed as lowest fifth of grip
strength distribution); and slow walking speed (lowest fifth
of walking speed) according to the frailty phenotype crite-
ria.11,20 If walking speed was unavailable, we used infor-
mation on self-reported slow walking pace (being unable
to walk more than few steps or <200 yards or difficulty
walking across a room) or low physical activity (self-report
of being less or much less active than an average man).
Presence of 3 or more of these components was defined as
frailty.
Frailty status at the 3-year follow-up in 2014 was
based on information from postal questionnaires (response
rate 64%). Frailty phenotype was based on subjective mea-
sures of the frailty components. This measure of frailty has
been found to be as predictive of established adverse out-
comes (disability, falls, death) as the frailty measure using
objective measures in our study.21 Exhaustion and low
physical activity were assessed in the same way as at base-
line (aged 71–92), with questions on exhaustion (Do you
feel full of energy?) and physical activity (less or much less
active than an average man). Grip strength was based on
participants’ rating of their grip strength compared with
that of other people their age; response of fair or poor was
classified as low grip strength. Slow walking speed was
based on self-report of usual walking pace. Participants
who rated their walking pace as slow were classified as
having slow walking speed. Weight loss was based on self-
report of a decrease in weight in the last 4 years.
Covariates
Socioeconomic status was based on the longest-held occu-
pation recorded at study entry (aged 40–59) and included
six social class groups (I, II, III nonmanual, III manual, IV,
V).22 For the purposes of this study, social classes I, II,
and III nonmanual were grouped as nonmanual, and III
manual, IV, and V were grouped as manual social class.
Detailed questions on smoking and medical history were
included in the questionnaire in 2010–12. Smoking status
was categorized as current smoker, long-term exsmoker
(gave up smoking before 1983), recent exsmoker, and
never smoker. History of coronary heart disease (CHD)

 was based on report of a doctor’s diagnosis of angina pec-
toris,
heart
attack
(coronary
thrombosis,
myocardial
infarction), or heart failure. History of diabetes was based
on a doctor’s diagnosis of diabetes or a fasting glucose
level greater than 7 mmol/L. Regular use of prescribed
medications with xerostomia (dry mouth) as a side effect
was identified from questionnaires and included antimus-
carinics (anticholinergics), antidepressants (tricyclics, selec-
tive
serotonin
reuptake
inhibitors),
alpha-blockers,
antihistamines, antipsychotics, baclofen, bupropion, cloni-
dine, 5HT1 agonists, opioids, tizanidine, and diuretics.23
Participants were categorized in 1 of 3 groups as taking 0,
1, or 2 or more of these medications. The use of medica-
tions with xerostomia as a side effect was closely related
to report of dry mouth symptoms (67% of those taking ≥1
of these reported having at least one dry mouth symptom,
P = .001).
Statistical Analysis
Associations between oral health measures and frailty were
examined cross-sectionally (at age 71–92 in 2010–12) and
prospectively (incident frailty at 3-year follow-up in 2014)
using logistic regression models with nonfrail as the refer-
ence group. Two measures of tooth loss were used (3-cate-
gory
variable
of
≥21
(the
minimum
considered
for
functional dentition), 1–20, and 0 (edentulism); 0 (eden-
tulism). Two measures of periodontal conditions were
examined (>20% sites with periodontal pockets >3.5 mm
as a proportion of number of sites examined; >20% sites
with loss of attachment >5.5 mm as a proportion of num-
ber of sites examined). Self-rated oral health was grouped
into excellent or good versus fair or poor; dry mouth
symptoms were categorized as 0, 1 to 2, and 3 or more
symptoms; and sensitivity to hot, cold, and sweet and diffi-
culty eating were binary (yes or no). A cumulative measure
of poor oral health was created combining complete tooth
loss; fair or poor self-rated oral health; dry mouth; sensi-
tivity to hot, cold, or sweet; and difficulty eating and cate-
gorized as 0, 1, 2, or 3 or more oral health problems.
Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals
(CIs) were computed after adjustment for age, social class,
smoking status, history of diabetes, history of cardiovascu-
lar disease (CVD), and use of medications with dry mouth
as a side effect. For the adjustments, age was fitted as a
continuous variable. Social class (2 levels); smoking status
(4 levels), history of CVD or diabetes (2 levels), and use of
medications (3 levels) were fitted as categorical variables
in the regression models. In the models for incident frailty,
prevalent cases of frailty at baseline (2010–12) were
excluded (n = 168, 14%). All analyses were performed
using Stata/SE version 14 (Stata Corp., College Station,
TX).
RESULTS
In 2010–12, 1,722 participants aged 71 to 92 attended a
reexamination (55% response rate), of whom 1,622 had
complete data on frailty status; 2147 men completed ques-
tionnaires (68% response rate). The prevalence of eden-
tulism was 20%, and 64% had fewer than 21 teeth. In
terms
of
periodontal
conditions,
25%
had
loss
of
attachment greater than 5.5 mm and 29% periodontal
pocket depth greater than 3.5 mm. For self-reported oral
health measures, 11% reported sensitivity to hot, cold, or
sweet; 33% had 1 dry mouth symptom, and 29% had 2
or more; 34% rated their oral health as fair or poor; and
11% reported difficulty eating. The prevalence of frailty
was 19% (n = 303). After an average of 3 years of follow-
up, 1,284 men completed a postal questionnaire in 2014
(64% response rate). Based on these follow-up data, there
were 107 (10%) cases of incident frailty over the follow-
up period.
Table 1 summarizes the baseline characteristics of par-
ticipants aged 71 to 92 according to their frailty status.
Participants identified as frail were older (on average)
(P < .001) and more likely to be in the manual social class
(P = .03), have a history of diabetes or CVD (P < .001),
and be currently prescribed 2 or more medications with
dry mouth as a side effect (P < .001) than those identified
as nonfrail. Participants who were frail had higher levels
of each of the frailty components (weakness, exhaustion,
weight loss, low physical activity, slow walking speed)
than nonfrail participants (all P < .001; results presented
in Supplementary Tables S1 and S2).
Table 2 shows the cross-sectional associations between
oral health measures and frailty at baseline (aged 71–92).
In age-adjusted models, men who were edentulous and
had fair or poor self-rated oral health, difficulty eating,
and dryness of mouth were more likely to be frail. Associ-
ations between frailty and edentulism (OR = 1.63, 95%

remained significant after further adjustment for smoking,
social class, history of CVD or diabetes, and medication
use. Having more oral health problems was also signifi-
cantly associated with being frail in the fully adjusted

In age-adjusted models, the risk of becoming frail over
the 3-year follow-up period was greater in participants
who were edentulous (OR = 1.78, 95% CI = 1.10–2.88)
and those reporting fair or poor oral health (OR = 1.65,
95% CI = 1.08–2.52) (Table 3). Periodontal measures of
loss of attachment and periodontal pocket depth were not
significantly associated with incident frailty. Problems of

and

(OR = 1.69, 95% CI = 0.96–2.95) were also not signifi-
cantly associated with incident frailty. Participants with 1
or 2 (OR = 1.83, 95% CI = 1.09–3.07) or 3 or more dry
mouth symptoms (OR = 2.20, 95% CI = 1.30–3.73) were
at a higher risk of incident frailty than those without. The
risk of incident frailty was slightly greater for every addi-
tional dry mouth symptom (OR = 1.18, 95% CI = 1.07–
1.29; P for trend = .001). Finally, the risk of incident
frailty was higher in participants with more oral health
problems (1-item increase in number of oral health prob-
lems:
OR = 1.36,
95%
CI = 1.10–1.67;
P
for
trend = .005). After further adjustments for covariates, the
risk of developing frailty remained higher in participants
who were edentulous (OR = 1.90, 95% CI = 1.03–3.52);
had 3 or more dry mouth symptoms (OR = 2.05, 95% CI
1.19–3.51); and had 1 (OR = 2.31, 95% CI = 1.17–4.58),

DISCUSSION
Our study in a population-based sample of British men
aged 71 to 92 showed that various aspects of poor oral
health were associated with being frail and with incident
frailty in older age. In our longitudinal investigations in
1,054 older adults, we found that complete tooth loss, dry
mouth, and cumulative oral health problems were, in

 particular, associated with incidence of frailty independent
of socioeconomic factors and comorbidities. These findings
highlight the importance of oral health in older popula-
tions and the potential contribution of poor oral health to
developing frailty.
The influence of poor oral health in older age on
frailty is not well established. To our knowledge, the only
previous prospective study recently published on oral
health and frailty was in Mexican older adults.15 Similar
to our findings, that study found an association between
tooth loss and frailty, but unlike the previous study, we
did not find periodontal disease markers to be associated
with incident frailty, which could be because the measures
of periodontal disease in our study were limited to 6 index
teeth and possible differences in the study populations.
In our prospective analyses, we found that complete
tooth loss, poor self-rated oral health, and dry mouth were
associated with incident frailty over 3 years of follow-up,
although the associations with poor self-rated oral health
were attenuated after adjustment for socioeconomic factors
and comorbidities. The influence of dry mouth remained
significantly associated with incident frailty even after
adjustments for covariates. Dry mouth in older age is often
a consequence of polypharmacy, particularly as a side
effect
of
the
use
of
antidepressants,
antihypertensive
medications (alpha- and beta-blockers, diuretics, calcium
channel blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibi-
tors).24,25 Dry mouth affects oral health–related quality of
life and denture-related problems (sores and ulcers) and
has important influences on eating and swallowing func-
tions. It is possible that the influence of tooth loss and dry
mouth on frailty is because of their effect on nutritional
status.26 Although self-reported difficulty eating itself was
not associated with frailty, it is not a robust marker of
nutritional status, which needs to be further explored as a
possible mediator using robust validated methods. It is also

 possible that underlying comorbidities mediate the rela-
tionship between dry mouth and frailty. Although we
adjusted for diabetes, CVD, and medication use, the possi-
bility of residual confounding remains. Another important
finding of our study that has not been previously reported
is the association between a composite or cumulative mea-
sure of oral health problems and frailty; we found that
having more oral health problems was associated with
greater risk of incident frailty, which remained significant
on full adjustment.
Strengths and Limitations
A particular strength of our study is that we prospectively
investigated associations between a range of oral health
measures and incidence of frailty in a representative sam-
ple of older British men. The oral health measures used in
our study included objective assessments of tooth count
and periodontal disease and self-reported measures of self-
rated oral health and dry mouth. Self-rated oral health is
known to be a strong marker of oral disease,18,27,28 and
dry mouth is prevalent, affecting more than one-third of
older adults.17,25 We also created a composite score to
capture the combined effect of oral health problems in
older adults. Limitations of our study are that our sample
comprised older men who were mostly white Europeans.
Therefore, our results have limited generalizability to older
women and other ethnic groups. The moderate response
rate of 55% for the physical examination at baseline is
likely to have excluded individuals with worse health. As
in previous examinations, nonresponders tend to be older
and more likely to be in a manual social class groups and
have poor or fair self-rated oral health. It is therefore pos-
sible that the role of socioeconomic position and comor-
bidities was not fully accounted for in our adjustments for
the associations between oral health measures and frailty.
Our outcome measure of frailty was based on self-reported
measures of frailty components, as opposed to the baseline
measure of frailty, which included objective measures of
grip strength and walking speed. It is possible that our
outcome measures underestimated the incidence of frailty.
Nevertheless, we have shown that this frailty measure is
robust and is just as predictive of known adverse outcomes
of frailty (disability, falls, death) as frailty measures com-
prising objective components.21
CONCLUSIONS
Our findings highlight the importance of oral health prob-
lems that are not only associated with the presence of
physical frailty, but may also influence the development of
frailty in older age. Our findings particularly highlight the
importance of tooth loss, dry mouth, and cumulative oral
health problems, all of which were independently associ-
ated with incident frailty. Further research is needed to
understand mechanisms underlying associations between
oral health and frailty, for example to explore whether the
association is mediated through nutrition and inflamma-
tion. Although causal associations cannot be fully estab-
lished from our study, our findings suggest that dry mouth
or accumulation of oral health problems could be powerful
markers
and
predictors
of
frailty
in
older
people.
Increasing interest in identifying frail older people has led
to tools such as the Frailty Index, which includes deficits
such as comorbidities, poor physical function, and sensory
impairments,10 but oral health is underrecognized in the
assessment and care of older people. Markers of poor oral
health could be useful indicators of frailty and valuable
additions to health screening assessments used in older
people. Further research is needed to develop simple mark-
ers of oral health that could be used widely in assessments
of older people. Poor oral health could also be important
as a modifiable risk factor for frailty through its effect on
oral intake and nutritional status. This needs to be investi-
gated in intervention studies.
