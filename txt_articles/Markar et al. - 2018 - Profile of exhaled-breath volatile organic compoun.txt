Background: Pancreatic cancer has a very poor prognosis as most patients are diagnosed at an advanced
stage when curative treatments are not possible. Breath volatile organic compounds (VOCs) have shown
potential as novel biomarkers to detect cancer. The aim of the study was to quantify differences in exhaled
breath VOCs of patients with pancreatic cancers compared with cohorts without cancer.
Methods: Patients were recruited to an initial development cohort and a second validation cohort. The
cancer group included patients with localized and metastatic cancers, whereas the control group included
patients with benign pancreatic disease or normal pancreas. The reference test for comparison was
radiological imaging using abdominal CT, ultrasound imaging or endoscopic ultrasonography, confirmed
by histopathological examination as appropriate. Breath was collected from the development cohort with
steel bags, and from the validation cohort using the ReCIVA™ system. Analysis was performed using gas
chromatography–mass spectrometry.
Results: A total of 68 patients were recruited to the development cohort (25 with cancer, 43 no
cancer) and 64 to the validation cohort (32 with cancer, 32 no cancer). Of 66 VOCs identified, 12
were significantly different between groups in the development cohort on univariable analysis. Receiver
operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis using significant volatile compounds and the validation
cohort produced an area under the curve of 0⋅736 (sensitivity 81 per cent, specificity 58 per cent) for
differentiating cancer from no cancer, and 0⋅744 (sensitivity 70 per cent, specificity 74 per cent) for
differentiating adenocarcinoma from no cancer.
Conclusion: Breath VOCs may distinguish patients with pancreatic cancer from those without cancer.

Introduction
Pancreatic cancers are estimated to cause over 40 000
deaths annually in the USA and were estimated to be
the fourth largest contributor to overall cancer deaths in
20171. Only 15–20 per cent of patients have potentially
curable disease at the time of diagnosis2,
3. Referrals for
investigation of suspected pancreatic cancer from primary
care depend on symptom recognition. Large primary care
database studies and patient surveys indicate that patients
with pancreatic cancer visit their primary care physician
frequently in the months and years before diagnosis4. How-
ever, almost half of patients are still diagnosed as a result
of an emergency presentation to hospital5. Currently the
majority of European referral guidelines for the assess-
ment of pancreatic cancer are focused on patient demo-
graphics and clinical presentation, and commonly include
people aged 60 years and over with weight loss and other
symptoms6. Early symptoms are intermittent and over-
lap with those of other common benign conditions. The
difficulty in symptom recognition is compounded by a
lack of effective objective diagnostic methods that could
be employed in general practice. The vast majority of
biomarker studies have targeted high-risk groups, such as
those with hereditary pancreatitis, familial pancreatic can-
cer and intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms. T
o date,
translation of biomarkers into clinical use has failed for a
variety of reasons, including failure to include appropri-
ate controls, such as patients with chronic pancreatitis, and
failure to account for confounding factors such as biliary
obstruction and diabetes7,
8.

and lung9–14. The authors15,
16 have previously developed
and validated a breath test for the diagnosis of oesoph-
agogastric and colorectal adenocarcinomas. The primary
objective of the present study was to investigate changes in
exhaled-breath VOCs from patients with primary pancre-
atic cancers compared with people who have benign pan-
creatic disease or normal pancreas.
Methods
All enrolled patients were recruited from the Imperial
College NHS Trust from March 2016 to December 2016.
Regional ethical approval was granted (14/LO/1136).
Details of the study were explained to all eligible patients,
and fully informed and written consent was obtained
before enrolment. Demographic and clinical information
was collected.
Study design and patient recruitment
A development cohort and a validation cohort were
studied. In the development cohort, exhaled breath was
collected and analysed to identify VOCs that differed in
concentration between patients with cancer and controls
without cancer. The compounds were used to develop the
diagnostic model for pancreatic cancer and validated using
a second independent cohort.
In both the development and validation cohorts, patients
with pancreatic cancer were compared with a control (no
cancer) group that included patients with benign pancre-
atic diseases. For the pancreatic cancer group, patients
with localized pancreatic cancers provided breath samples
before operation on surgical wards or in the endoscopy unit
before undergoing endoscopic ultrasonography. Patients
with non-resected metastatic pancreatic cancers were
recruited from oncology clinics. For the control group,
patients were recruited with a diagnosis of other pancreatic
conditions, including intraductal papillary mucinous neo-
plasm, cysts, pseudocysts and chronic pancreatitis. Patients
scheduled for abdominal ultrasound examination with a
normal-appearing pancreas on imaging were also recruited
to the control group.
Reference test
All diagnoses were confirmed with a standard reference
test. Pancreatic cancer was confirmed by abdominal CT
or endoscopic ultrasonography and histologically by
fine-needle aspiration biopsy. Abdominal CT or ultra-
sonography was used to examine the pancreas of patients
in the control group.
Exhaled breath collection
Exhaled breath was collected using previously validated
methodology11 that was informed by investigations regard-
ing the influence of breath manoeuvres and hospital envi-
ronment on VOC measurements17,
18. All patients were
fasted and ceased smoking for a minimum of 4 h before
breath sampling to minimize the risk of oral contamination
or dietary intake acting as a confounder. Atmospheric air
from sample collection rooms and the laboratory was also
analysed to investigate the effects of background VOCs on
collected breath samples.
The method of breath sampling was changed from use
of inert steel bags (GastroCH4ECK®; Bedfont Scientific,
Maidstone, UK) in the initial profiling study to use of
the ReCIVA™ breath sample system (Owlstone Medical,
Cambridge, UK) in the validation study. The ReCIVA™ is
a reproducible system that allows direct collection of breath
on to thermal desorption (TD) tubes. The system will be
used in a planned multicentre study and so was tested in the
present validation cohort.
Breath was collected using secure 500-ml steel breath
bags (GastroCH4ECK®), which were washed through
with synthetic air before sampling. Patients were asked to
perform deep nasal inhalation followed by complete exha-
lation through the mouth. Alveolar air was collected pref-
erentially over dead-space air by capturing end-expiratory
breath. VOCs from breath bags were then preconcen-
trated on to TD tubes by transferring 250 ml of breath
at 50 ml/min across the tubes by use of 10-mm diameter
tubing and hand-held air pumps (210-1002MTX; SKC,
Blandford Forum, UK) (Fig. 1).
With the ReCIVA™ system, breath sampling remains
completely non-invasive and involves placing a disposable
face mask around the nose and mouth, and instructing the
patient to perform normal tidal breathing. A constant sup-
ply of clean air is supplied to the patient’
s mask by means of
a pump connected to an active charcoal scrubber (CASPER
system; Owlstone Medical). The ReCIVA™ system uses an
internal carbon dioxide monitor and pressure sensors to cap-
ture alveolar breath preferentially and transfer it directly
on to TD tubes. As with bag collection, a total of 250 ml
of alveolar breath was transferred on to the TD tubes.
Mass spectrometric analysis
All samples were analysed within 48 h of collection.
Data from degradation studies have shown that volatiles
remain stable within breath bags or when stored on TD
tubes for 48 h19. TD–gas chromatography (GC)–mass
spectrometry (MS) is an analytical method used for the
identification and quantification of volatile and semivolatile

Fig. 1 Process of concentrating volatile organic compounds from steel breath bags on to thermal desorption tubes. The arrow indicates
the direction of flow of the breath sample
compounds. VOCs entering the GC inlet travel through a
chromatography column (Zebron ZB-624; Phenomenex,
Macclesfield, UK), are separated according to their affin-
ity with the stationary phase, and exit the column at a
specific retention time. The VOCs then enter a mass
spectrometer (5977A MSD; Agilent T
echnologies, Stock-
port, UK), where they are ionized, separated based on
their mass-to-charge (m/z) ratios and eventually detected.
The combination of both GC and MS allows improved
compound identification compared with use of either
component individually.
VOCs were concentrated before GC–MS analysis by fix-
ing them to adsorbent materials that line the inside of
the TD tube. All TD tubes (T
enax® TA/Carbograph™
5TD; Markes International, Llantrisant, UK) were condi-
tioned (TC-20™ tube conditioning station; Markes Inter-
national) at 300∘C for 80 min. The tubes were loaded on to
carousels, checked for leakage, and dry purged for 3 min to
remove excess moisture in order to ensure that VOCs were
not oxidized upon heating. Using an automated TD sys-
tem (TD-100™; Markes International), the tube was then
heated at 280∘C, with the breath sample transferred on to
a 10∘C cold trap for 10 min of desorption (nitrogen flow
50 ml/min). Subsequently, the cold trap was heated rapidly
to 290∘C, transferring the VOCs to the chromatography
column. In an attempt to minimize fixation of background
VOCs to the tubes, the time from tube conditioning to
preconcentration never exceeded 1 h. Further details of
the GC–MS methodology can be found in Appendix S1
(supporting information).
Data extraction
Chromatograms and mass spectral data were extracted
using MassHunter Qualitative software (Agilent T
echnolo-
gies, Santa Clara, California, USA). The chemical iden-
tity of every peak, with retention times between 3 and
47 min, was confirmed by reference to the National Insti-
tute of Standards and T
echnology (NIST) MS library
version 2.0. Each identified compound was then semiquan-
tified through a representative mass ion. In a first step,
peaks were extracted in automated fashion using Agilent
MassHunter Quantitative software, which ran the analy-
sis across all chromatograms. In a further step, data were
revised manually with the aim of correcting errors due to
misidentifications, random variation in retention times and
possible co-eluting chromatographic peaks. A researcher
blinded to the clinical disease state of the patient undertook
the data extraction.
Statistical analysis
Tumour disease status and confounding factors were con-
sidered independent variables and VOC abundance was
considered the dependent variable. A Shapiro–Wilk sta-
tistical test was performed to check the data distribution.
Significant differences in the abundance of VOCs between
cancer and no-cancer groups in the development cohort
were assessed using univariable Mann–Whitney U tests,
as the data were not normally distributed. VOCs found
to be significant on univariable analysis were included
in a logistic regression analysis to form the basis of a
diagnostic model for use in the validation cohort. Receiver
operating characteristic (ROC) curves were produced
by plotting the true-positive rate (sensitivity) against the
false-positive rate (1 – specificity). ROC plots were con-
structed for comparison of cancer versus no cancer and
adenocarcinoma versus no cancer. An additional subset
ROC analysis was undertaken for localized pancreatic
adenocarcinoma versus no cancer. The area under the
curve (AUC) was used to assess the predictive power of
the model and its ability to distinguish between cancer
and no cancer. Sensitivity and specificity values were
extracted from the coordinates of the ROC plots. The
cancer group included all subgroups of pancreatic can-
cer, whereas the no-cancer group included both positive
control (other pancreatic non-cancer disease) and normal
pancreas groups.
Statistical analysis was also performed to identify sig-
nificant differences between the groups in age, ethnicity,
sex, gastro-oesophageal reflux disease, pancreatitis, gas-
tric ulcers, hepatitis, diabetes mellitus, smoking status and

against VOC abundance by means of linear regression.

were two-sided. All statistical analysis was carried out using
SPSS® version 24 (IBM, Armonk, New York, USA).
Results
A total of 68 patients were recruited to the model develop-
ment cohort (Table 1). T
wenty-five patients were assigned
to the cancer group and 43 to the no-cancer group. Can-
cers included localized adenocarcinoma (7; pancreatic duc-
tal adenocarcinoma in 6), localized neuroendocrine tumour
(NET) (4), metastatic adenocarcinoma (10) and metastatic
NET (4). The no-cancer group included 20 positive con-
trols and 23 patients with normal pancreas.
A further 64 patients were recruited to the valida-
tion cohort, 32 with and 32 without cancer. Cancers
included local adenocarcinoma (14; pancreatic ductal
adenocarcinoma in 12), local NET (2), metastatic adeno-
carcinoma (14) and metastatic NET (2). The no-cancer
group comprised 24 positive controls and eight patients
with normal pancreas. There were no significant differ-
ences in patient demographics or co-morbidities between
the cancer and no-cancer groups (Table 1).

a sensitivity and specificity of 100 per cent, as all cases
of localized adenocarcinoma were correctly distinguished
from non-cancer cases.
For the model validation study, the AUC for distin-
guishing cancer from no cancer was 0⋅736 (0⋅614 to

ficity of 58 per cent (Fig. 3a). The AUC for distinguish-
ing adenocarcinoma from no cancer was 0⋅744 (0⋅615 to

for localized adenocarcinoma versus no cancer was 0⋅855
(0⋅732 to 0⋅914), with a sensitivity of 79 per cent and
specificity of 81 per cent.
Discussion
Analysis of VOCs in exhaled breath identified a total of 12
compounds that were significantly dysregulated in patients
with pancreatic cancer. The significant VOCs were from
three main chemical groups, namely aldehydes, alkanes
and alcohols. All ROC models showed good discrimina-
tion, with AUC values over 0⋅700. Discrimination was
stronger in the models distinguishing adenocarcinoma
from no cancer.
The chemical group with the largest number of signif-
icantly dysregulated breath VOCs in pancreatic cancer
was the aldehyde group. Other studies9,
13,
20 have also
demonstrated changes in breath aldehyde in patients with
cancer, including oesophagogastric, colorectal and lung
tumours. The specific aldehydes of interest were different
depending on the cancer site. There are few data available
on the mechanisms underlying breath aldehyde changes
in pancreatic cancer. One possible explanation is altered
activity of enzymes, such as aldehyde dehydrogenase iso-
form 1 (ALDH1), as demonstrated in an in vitro study21.
ALDH1 causes the irreversible breakdown of aldehydes
to their corresponding carboxylic acid or alcohols, and
for this reason is thought to be crucial for the survival of
cancer stem cells22. By comparing a range of normal and
cancerous epithelial tissues, Deng and colleagues23 were
able to demonstrate that pancreatic cancers showed the
most extensive expression and activity of ALDH1. This
increased activity and expression of ALDH1 in pancreatic
cancers may explain the decreased levels of benzaldehyde
and the altered levels of alcohols observed in the present
study.

 Breath volatile organic compounds in pancreatic cancer
1499
Currently, carbohydrate antigen (CA) 19-9 is the most
commonly used tumour marker for pancreatic cancer.
However, it shows a non-specific increase in a number of
benign and malignant conditions, including pancreatitis,
cirrhosis, acute cholangitis and colorectal cancer3. Further-
more, is not expressed in 5–10 per cent of the Caucasian
population due to a Lewis a–/b– genotype24. Overall,
only 65 per cent of patients with surgically resectable
pancreatic cancer have a raised level of CA19-93. As breath
testing in pancreatic cancer was still in the early validation
phase in the present study, it was considered inadvisable to
make firm comparisons between breath VOC and CA19-9
testing.
The strength of the study lies in its design, with the inclu-
sion of a positive control group, a reference test for each
patient, and an independent cohort of patients to validate
volatile biomarkers employing a different breath collection
method. The method used in the validation study lends
itself to multicentre clinical investigations, as ReCIVA™
provides a reproducible breath collection method and TD
tubes offer a robust transport system that keeps volatile
compounds stable for approximately 4 weeks. The results
provide the foundation for a planned, large multicentre
study that could further establish the potential of breath
VOC testing as a diagnostic tool for pancreatic cancers.
The identification of VOC cancer biomarkers permitted
cross-platform mass spectrometric validation and mech-
anistic studies of VOC production in cancer states, thus
increasing the scientific rigour of the breath VOC diag-
nostic field. Other research groups have used sensor-based
technology such as an electronic nose to identify the pres-
ence or absence of a disease state25. A recent study26 used
ion-mobility MS to diagnose pancreatic cancer from uri-
nary VOCs, with an impressive diagnostic accuracy (91 per
cent sensitivity and 83 per cent specificity). Nevertheless,
this study requires external validation.
The study has several limitations. The results of this
single-centre investigation must be externally validated.
Importantly, confounders not included in the present anal-
ysis such as weight or BMI may influence the concentration
of VOCs. The method of breath sampling was changed
between the development and validation cohorts, which
may have influenced the VOC concentration and recov-
ery of certain VOCs. However, in the validation study, the
identity of compounds dysregulated in pancreatic cancer
was confirmed and not the specific levels of each com-
pound. The performance of the test should be examined
in early pancreatic cancer as an ultimate goal for the breath
test that could influence disease survival. The present study
included patients with locally advanced and metastatic dis-
ease as this group represents the majority of patients with
pancreatic cancer in clinical practice and should not be
missed by the diagnostic model. However, the diagnostic
accuracies for localized pancreatic adenocarcinoma in the
development and validation cohorts were 100 and 86 per
cent respectively, suggesting the potential for early diag-
nosis that requires more robust specific investigation in a
large-scale multicentre study.
Breath VOC sampling is a completely non-invasive
test
with
high
acceptability
among
patients
and
clinicians11,
17–19. The authors envisage using exhaled
breath testing as a triage investigation to establish the
risk of pancreatic cancer in patients presenting with
non-specific symptoms to guide referral for CT. Another
application is screening for high-risk groups such as those
with hereditary pancreatitis, familial pancreatic cancer,
resent-onset diabetes and intraductal papillary mucinous
neoplasms. The final application of breath testing in the
patient care pathway will depend on test sensitivity and
specificity in large multicentre clinical trials, and its per-
formance in early pancreatic cancer and high-risk groups.
