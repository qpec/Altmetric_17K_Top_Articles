 Pharmacologic Treatment of Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis: Synopsis
of Guidance From the 2017 Joint Task Force on Practice
Parameters
Dana V. Wallace, MD; Mark S. Dykewicz, MD; John Oppenheimer, MD; Jay M. Portnoy, MD; and David M. Lang, MD
Description: The Joint Task Force on Practice Parameters,
which comprises representatives of the American Academy of
Allergy, Asthma and Immunology (AAAAI) and the American
College
of
Allergy,
Asthma
and
Immunology
(ACAAI),
formed a workgroup to review evidence and provide guidance
to health care providers on the initial pharmacologic treatment
of seasonal allergic rhinitis in patients aged 12 years or
older.
Methods: To update a prior systematic review, the workgroup
searched
MEDLINE,
EMBASE,
and
the
Cochrane
Central
Register of Controlled Trials from 18 July 2012 to 29 July 2016 to
identify studies that addressed efficacy and adverse effects of
single or combination pharmacotherapy for seasonal allergic
rhinitis. In conjunction with the Joint Task Force, the workgroup
reviewed
the
evidence
and
developed
recommendations
about initial treatment approaches by using the Grading
of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation
approach. Members of the AAAAI, the ACAAI, and the
general public provided feedback on the draft document,
which the Joint Task Force reviewed before finalizing the
guideline.
Recommendation 1: For initial treatment of seasonal allergic
rhinitis in persons aged 12 years or older, routinely prescribe
monotherapy with an intranasal corticosteroid rather than an in-
tranasal corticosteroid in combination with an oral antihistamine.
(Strong recommendation)
Recommendation 2: For initial treatment of seasonal allergic
rhinitis in persons aged 15 years or older, recommend an
intranasal corticosteroid over a leukotriene receptor antagonist.
(Strong recommendation)
Recommendation 3: For treatment of moderate to severe sea-
sonal allergic rhinitis in persons aged 12 years or older, the clini-
cian may recommend the combination of an intranasal corticoste-
roid and an intranasal antihistamine for initial treatment. (Weak
recommendation)

S
easonal allergic rhinitis, which affects up to 14% of
the U.S. adult population, is managed by clinicians
and patients using a combination of prescription and
over-the-counter medications. Most patients who con-
sult an allergy and immunology specialist have already
tried many over-the-counter monotherapies without
success and are seeking more effective treatment. No
consensus exists about whether a particular medication
should be used for initial treatment or about the benefit
of using 2 or more medications concurrently for initial
treatment. This synopsis of a 2017 guideline from the
Joint Task Force on Practice Parameters addresses spe-
cific recommendations regarding initial pharmacother-
apy approaches for patients aged 12 years or older
with seasonal allergic rhinitis. Three key questions were
addressed in this evidence-based guideline, which was
developed using the GRADE (Grading of Recommen-
dations
Assessment,
Development
and
Evaluation)
method. Allergen avoidance, which can be effective for
indoor allergens, is usually inadequate for the outdoor
allergens that cause and perpetuate symptoms in pa-
tients with seasonal allergic rhinitis. Many patients with
moderate-to-severe seasonal allergic rhinitis may ben-
efit from specific allergen immunotherapy (subcutane-
ous or sublingual), which is the only disease-modifying
therapeutic method (1, 2). These management inter-
ventions and pharmacotherapy for perennial allergic
rhinitis were not addressed in this guideline.
GUIDELINE DEVELOPMENT AND REVIEW
PROCESS
The Joint Task Force on Practice Parameters
formed a workgroup, comprising volunteers from the
American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunol-
ogy (AAAAI) and the American College of Allergy,
Asthma and Immunology (ACAAI), to find and critique
evidence relevant to pharmacotherapy for seasonal al-
lergic rhinitis. Three patient advocates were invited to
participate in the development of the final recommen-
dations. All workgroup members disclosed potential
conflicts of interest in accordance with the standards of
the National Academy of Sciences (3). The workgroup
developed a list of clinical questions about the use of
single or combination medications for seasonal allergic
rhinitis. From these, 3 key questions were chosen as the
focus of a systematic review. Of note, the 3 questions
were also part of a large systematic review on allergic
rhinitis that was funded by the Agency for Healthcare
Research and Quality (AHRQ) and published in 2013
(4). The AHRQ review was limited to randomized con-
trolled trials of persons aged 12 years or older with
seasonal allergic rhinitis of at least 2 weeks' duration
during an active pollen season. The workgroup up-
dated
the
searches
used
in
the
AHRQ
review
(MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Regis-
ter of Controlled Trials) from 18 July 2012 to 29 July
2016 and found no additional randomized trials of
medication therapy for seasonal allergic rhinitis.

 The workgroup and the Joint Task Force reviewed
the quality of the published trials; contacted authors,
when possible, for any missing information; evaluated
the clinical significance of reported patient-important
outcomes; and determined the overall quality of evi-
dence across outcomes. The certainty of the body of
evidence, using GRADE quality analysis and evaluating
for inconsistency, indirectness, and imprecision, was
defined as high, moderate, low, or very low (5). Before
determining the final recommendation or suggestion
for an intervention, the Joint Task Force considered
safety, cost, and patient preference. These consider-
ations were based on experience and were informed
by an informal review of the literature. The guideline
was externally reviewed by the AAAAI and the ACAAI,
by both appointed official reviewers and members at
large. The document was posted on the Joint Task
Force Web site (www.allergyparameters.org) for gen-
eral public review. All comments that were received
were reviewed by the Joint Task Force, revisions were
incorporated, and general feedback was provided to
reviewers. The final guideline and appendices are pub-
lished in the Annals of Allergy, Asthma, & Immunology
and are posted at www.allergyparameters.org (6).
RECOMMENDATIONS
1. For initial treatment of seasonal allergic rhinitis in
persons aged 12 years or older, routinely prescribe
monotherapy with an intranasal corticosteroid rather
than an intranasal corticosteroid in combination with an
oral antihistamine. (Strong recommendation)
Eight trials addressed whether using a combination
of an oral antihistamine and an intranasal corticosteroid
has greater clinical benefit than using an intranasal cor-
ticosteroid alone (7–14), but only 5 trials reported data
that could be analyzed (7–11). All 5 evaluated nasal
symptoms as the main outcome, 3 reported ocular
symptoms (8, 9, 11), and 1 reported quality of life as a
primary end point (10). For measurement of nasal
symptoms, 3 studies (8, 10, 11) used the Total Nasal
Symptom Score (TNSS), which measures nasal conges-
tion, sneezing, rhinorrhea, and nasal itching, each rated
on a 4-point Likert scale of 0 to 3 (0 indicates no symp-
toms, 1 indicates mild symptoms, 2 indicates moderate
symptoms, and 3 indicates severe symptoms) and
summed for a total score of 0 to 12. A study that re-
ported on the same 4 nasal symptoms (7) used a visual
analogue scale of 0 to 100 for each symptom, for a
maximum score of 400, and the remaining study (9)
used a scale of 0 to 9 for combined nasal symptom
severity. Inclusion criteria included a TNSS of 6 or
higher and a congestion score of 2 or higher (11), a
score of 200 or higher on a visual analogue scale of 0 to
400 (7), and the presence of at least 1 of 4 nasal symp-
toms plus headache or 1 additional symptom involving
the nose or eyes (9). One study did not require a spe-
cific nasal symptom severity score, but the mean TNSS
reported at baseline was 4.56 (95% CI, 3.61 to 5.50)
(10). Two trials included a placebo group receiving no
treatment (7, 11), 2 used a parallel-treatment design (8,
9), and 1 used a crossover design (10).
Overall, we judged the evidence as not proving a
benefit of adding an oral antihistamine to an intranasal
corticosteroid and recognized that oral antihistamines,
mainly first-generation, may cause sedation and other
adverse effects. Five trials (11, 15–17) disclosed and
met the sample size needed to determine statistically
significant findings, whereas the remaining studies ei-
ther did not report this value or did not obtain the
needed study participants; none of the trials used the
concept of minimal clinically important difference to
power the study. Although participants in these trials
were recruited on the basis of meeting criteria for sea-
sonal allergic rhinitis and reaching a threshold of nasal
symptoms, they were not randomly assigned on the ba-
sis of treatment failure despite regular use of an intra-
nasal corticosteroid. Because there may be a subgroup
of patients who experience treatment failure with an
intranasal corticosteroid alone and could benefit from
the addition of an oral antihistamine, these data do not
permit determination of whether adding an oral antihis-
tamine would benefit patients with residual symptoms
despite appropriately dosed intranasal corticosteroids.
2. For initial treatment of seasonal allergic rhinitis in
persons aged 15 years or older, recommend an intranasal
corticosteroid over a leukotriene receptor antagonist.
(Strong recommendation)
Five trials addressed the relative efficacy of a leu-
kotriene receptor antagonist (such as oral montelukast)
compared with an intranasal corticosteroid (15, 16, 18–
20). Overall, we judged the evidence as clearly showing
that an intranasal corticosteroid was more effective
than montelukast for nasal symptom reduction, al-
though in 1 study (19), the numerically greater im-
provement in symptom-free days did not reach statisti-
cal significance. The primary end points were the
participant-rated TNSS incorporating nasal congestion,
rhinorrhea, sneezing, and nasal itching (discussed ear-
lier) (18); a score of 0 to 400 on a visual analogue scale
(discussed earlier) (15, 16, 19); or a Composite Symp-
tom Score of 0 to 4 (20). Three of these studies in-
cluded a placebo group (18–20), and 2 used a parallel-
treatment design (15, 16). For inclusion, 3 studies
required a visual analogue scale score of 200 out of
400 for nasal symptom severity (15, 16, 19), and 2 trials
(18, 20) did not require any degree of nasal symptom
severity.
Although there is no consensus in the literature
about thresholds for a minimal clinically important dif-
ference between treatments, the workgroup and the
Joint Task Force determined that the reductions in na-
sal symptoms reported in the trials comparing an intra-
nasal corticosteroid versus montelukast were clinically
meaningful according to recently published criteria
(21). Some patients do not tolerate or accept the use of
an intranasal corticosteroid and prefer an oral agent,
such as montelukast, despite its lesser efficacy (22, 23).
In patients with a concurrent diagnosis of mild persis-
tent asthma, a leukotriene receptor antagonist may be
prescribed and may also provide benefit for seasonal

 allergic rhinitis; however, this would not be the pre-
ferred agent for a patient with either condition (24).
Finally, there may be subgroups of patients with sea-
sonal allergic rhinitis who are more responsive to a leu-
kotriene receptor antagonist, as in the case of asthma
(25).
3. For treatment of moderate to severe seasonal al-
lergic rhinitis in persons aged 12 years or older, the
clinician may recommend the combination of an intra-
nasal corticosteroid and an intranasal antihistamine for
initial treatment. (Weak recommendation)
The 2008 update of the Joint Task Force's rhinitis
practice parameter (26) recommended intranasal corti-
costeroids as the most effective medication class for
controlling symptoms, as did the original practice pa-
rameter from 1998 (27). Intranasal antihistamines,
which are generally less effective than intranasal corti-
costeroids, were suggested as an alternative for first-
line treatment of allergic and nonallergic rhinitis. The
2008 document also stated that, on the basis of limited
data reporting an additive benefit, concomitant admin-
istration of an intranasal antihistamine and an intranasal
corticosteroid in separate devices could be considered.
Five trials published since 2008 have addressed
the relative efficacy of combination therapy with an in-
tranasal antihistamine and an intranasal corticosteroid
compared with monotherapy with either agent for ini-
tial treatment of nasal symptoms in persons aged 12
years or older with seasonal allergic rhinitis (17, 28–30).
Four studies compared fluticasone propionate alone
versus fluticasone propionate (200 mcg) plus azelastine
(548 mcg) as a single combination spray (17, 28, 30).
The fifth study compared fluticasone propionate alone
versus fluticasone propionate plus azelastine, 1100
mcg daily, administered using 2 separate commercially
available sprays (29). Three trials included a placebo
group (17, 28, 30), and 1 used a parallel-treatment de-
sign (29). All studies required a reflective 12-hour TNSS
of 8 out of 12, and 3 studies (17, 29, 30) required a
congestion score of 2 or 3 for inclusion. All studies
used a reflective 12-hour morning and evening TNSS (0
to 12 for each, for a total score of 0 to 24 per day). A
review of the absolute nasal symptom reduction in 3
studies (17, 28, 30) showed that all participants had a
TNSS of 18.1 to 19.0 out of 24 at baseline; after treat-
ment, the reductions in symptom scores were �2.2
to �3.03 for placebo, �3.25 to �4.54 for azelastine,
�3.84 to �5.1 for fluticasone propionate, and �5.31 to
�5.7 for fluticasone propionate plus azelastine. The
fourth study (29) used the method of least squares and
found symptom reductions of 24.8% for azelastine,
29.1% for fluticasone propionate, and 37.9% for flutica-
sone propionate plus azelastine. The authors calculated
that the absolute improvements represented greater
than 40% relative improvement for the use of flutica-
sone propionate plus azelastine than with either agent
alone (29). In all 4 studies, fluticasone propionate plus
azelastine showed the greatest symptom reduction,
followed by fluticasone propionate, azelastine, and
placebo.
The workgroup and the Joint Task Force con-
cluded that for the primary end point of TNSS, the
observed differences were clinically meaningful (21).
However, for quality of life, assessed with the Rhinitis
Quality of Life Questionnaire and with a threshold of
0.5 for the minimal clinically important difference, we
found that combination therapy did not consistently ex-
ceed the minimal clinically important difference com-
pared with monotherapies. Combination therapy im-
proved overall ocular symptoms compared with either
monotherapy but reached a statistically significant dif-
ference only when compared with fluticasone propi-
onate (17, 28, 30). The rate of adverse events in the 5
studies was low. Dysgeusia, the most common adverse
event, was reported in all studies, and incidence varied
from 2.1% to 13.5% of participants and was higher in
the azelastine group in 2 studies (17, 28) and in the
group receiving fluticasone propionate plus azelastine
in 2 studies (29, 30). Occurrence of epistaxis in all treat-
ment groups was similar to or lower than in the placebo
groups in all studies. Somnolence, which was reported
in 2 of 6 studies, varied from 0.4% to 1.1% in the treat-
ment groups that included azelastine, similar to what
has been reported in other clinical trials (31).
Finally, the evidence analyzed for key question 3
showed that the addition of an intranasal antihistamine
to
an
intranasal
corticosteroid
in
patients
with
moderate-to-severe seasonal allergic rhinitis provides
additional benefit, in contrast to combination therapy
with an intranasal corticosteroid and an oral antihista-
mine (key question 1). Unlike recommendations 1 and
2, which were graded as strong, the Joint Task Force
graded recommendation 3 as weak. This was based
on several factors, including concerns about potential
bias in the available studies, a lack of studies that ad-
dressed add-on therapy rather than starting with 1 or 2
drugs, and consideration of the greater potential for
untoward effects and the added cost of using a second
medicine.
COMPARISON OF EVIDENCE-BASED GUIDELINES
ON ALLERGIC RHINITIS
The current guideline is 1 of 4 major allergic rhinitis
documents
published
since
2013
that
used
an
evidence-based approach. The other 2 guidelines were
the 2015 clinical practice guideline on allergic rhinitis
from the American Academy of Otolaryngology – Head
and Neck Surgery (AAO-HNS) (32) and the 2016 revi-
sion of the Allergic Rhinitis and its Impact on Asthma
(ARIA) guidelines (33). A comparative effectiveness re-
view was also completed by the AHRQ in 2013 (4).
The first question, which explored adding an oral
antihistamine to an intranasal corticosteroid for the ini-
tial treatment of seasonal allergic rhinitis, was ad-
dressed in all 4 documents. The reference articles eval-
uated by these 4 groups were almost identical. Both
the Joint Task Force and the AAO-HNS concluded that
there was no benefit of adding an oral antihistamine to
an intranasal corticosteroid, whereas ARIA found the
combination to be equivalent but an option for initial

 treatment. The quality of the evidence was judged to
be moderate by the Joint Task Force, weak by ARIA,
and insufficient to make a determination by the AHRQ
and was not addressed by the AAO-HNS. The recom-
mendation was rated as strong by the Joint Task Force
and weak by ARIA and was not rated by the AHRQ or
the AAO-HNS.
The second question, which involved comparison
of an intranasal corticosteroid versus a leukotriene re-
ceptor antagonist for the initial treatment of seasonal
allergic rhinitis, was addressed in only 3 of the 4 docu-
ments. The Joint Task Force found high-quality evi-
dence that intranasal corticosteroids were more effec-
tive than leukotriene receptor antagonists and issued a
strong recommendation, whereas the AHRQ, using the
same references, concluded that the agents were
equivalent, with good- to poor-quality evidence and a
strong recommendation. The AAO-HNS determined
that intranasal corticosteroids were more effective but
did not rate the quality of the evidence or the strength
of the recommendation. The 2010 ARIA guideline ad-
dressed this question and found low-quality evidence
that intranasal corticosteroids were more effective but
issued a strong recommendation (33).
The third question, which compared the effective-
ness of monotherapy with an intranasal corticosteroid
or an intranasal antihistamine versus the combination of
these agents for initial treatment of seasonal allergic
rhinitis, was addressed in all 4 documents. The Joint
Task Force (strong quality of evidence and weak rec-
ommendation) and the AAO-HNS (no grading of evi-
dence or strength of recommendation) concluded that
the combination was more effective than either mono-
therapy. The AHRQ (low-quality evidence and strong
recommendation) determined that monotherapy with
either agent was as effective as combination therapy.
ARIA stated that adding an intranasal antihistamine to
an intranasal corticosteroid did not improve efficacy
to a meaningful degree compared with monotherapy
with an intranasal corticosteroid (moderate-quality evi-
dence and weak recommendation); however, the com-
bination was judged to be more effective than mono-
therapy with an intranasal antihistamine (low-quality
evidence and weak recommendation). These inconsis-
tent recommendations may have resulted from guide-
line groups prioritizing various factors (such as efficacy
measures, relative benefits, adverse effects, patient ac-
ceptance, and cost) differently when comparing thera-
peutic interventions. Our weak recommendation for
combination therapy was based on concerns about po-
tential bias in the critically appraised studies and the
greater potential for adverse effects associated with
combination therapy, including dysgeusia and somno-
lence. The weak recommendation implies that most pa-
tients would wish to receive the combination, but many
would not want to receive it.
Although objective measures are ideal for assess-
ing outcomes in many diseases, for rhinitis the subjec-
tive, patient-reported TNSS is the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration's preferred measure for determining
drug efficacy. Although the TNSS is currently the best
tool available, it may not take into consideration all of
the elements that would constitute an improved quality
of life for patients with rhinitis. One major obstacle in
comparing the efficacy of treatment approaches in sea-
sonal allergic rhinitis is the lack of rigorous clinical trials
that have adequately defined a benchmark threshold
for a minimal clinically important difference for mean-
ingful improvement in TNSS. There currently is no uni-
versal agreement on the minimum reduction in TNSS
that should be considered clinically meaningful, given
that this value varies on the basis of whether one is
using the “distribution-based” approach (a statistically
derived method) or the “anchor-based” approach (a
method that relates symptom reduction to a patient-
related score of well-being) (21, 34, 35). Although not
all guideline writing groups apply a minimal clinically
important difference when evaluating outcomes of
treatment trials, those that do often use different
methods.
Consequently, guideline groups can review the
same data but reach different conclusions about the
comparative effectiveness of treatments for seasonal al-
lergic rhinitis that, in turn, can result in divergent rec-
ommendations (21). When treating patients with sea-
sonal allergic rhinitis, clinicians need to use their
expertise to assist patients in evaluating the best treat-
ment choice through shared decision making; consider
the potential for benefit as well as the potential for
harm, the burden, and the cost of combination therapy;
and
allow
patients
to
express
their
values
and
preferences and participate in the decision-making
process.
