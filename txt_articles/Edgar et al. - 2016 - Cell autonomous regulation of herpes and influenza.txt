Viruses are intracellular pathogens that hijack host cell machinery
and resources to replicate. Rather than being constant, host
physiology is rhythmic, undergoing circadian (∼24 h) oscillations
in many virus-relevant pathways, but whether daily rhythms impact
on viral replication is unknown. We find that the time of day of host
infection regulates virus progression in live mice and individual
cells. Furthermore, we demonstrate that herpes and influenza A
virus infections are enhanced when host circadian rhythms are abol-
ished by disrupting the key clock gene transcription factor Bmal1.
Intracellular trafficking, biosynthetic processes, protein synthesis,
and chromatin assembly all contribute to circadian regulation of
virus infection. Moreover, herpesviruses differentially target com-
ponents of the molecular circadian clockwork. Our work demon-
strates that viruses exploit the clockwork for their own gain and
that the clock represents a novel target for modulating viral repli-
cation that extends beyond any single family of these ubiquitous
pathogens.

iverse behavioral, physiological, and cellular processes ex-
hibit daily (circadian) rhythms, which persist without external
timing cues. Cell autonomous biological clocks drive circadian
rhythms observed at the whole organism level, enabling adapta-
tion to the 24-h cycle produced by the Earth’s rotation (1). At the
molecular level, circadian oscillations are thought to be generated
by genetic feedback loops involving the activating transcription
factors BMAL1 (ARNTL/Mop3), NPAS, and CLOCK. These
drive transcription of repressor proteins CRYPTOCHROME1/2
(CRY1/2) and PERIOD1/2 (PER1/2) that feedback to repress
their own transcription, additionally regulated by myriad post-
translational processes (2–4).
Circadian clocks confer competitive advantages to organisms.
Their disruption incurs fitness costs, and they influence many
aspects of human health and disease including sleep/wake cycles
and immune function (5, 6). Indeed, many innate and adaptive
immune responses are clock regulated. The immune response
undergoes regeneration and repair as the host transitions to the
resting phase of the daily cycle, but is primed for pathogen attack
at the onset of the active phase (5, 6). Although changes in host
responses to bacterial endotoxin or infection at different times of
day have been reported (7, 8), the influence of host circadian clocks
on progression of viral diseases is unknown. Here, we demonstrate
dynamic host–virus interactions over the 24-h day and also show
that genetic clock disruption augments virus replication in mice
and cells.
Results
Viruses are obligate intracellular pathogens and require host
organisms to proliferate. Over the course of a day, viruses may
encounter host environments that are more or less conducive to
replication and dissemination (5, 9, 10). We hypothesized that
the time of day of infection would influence viral replication. To
test this, we infected WT mice intranasally with a recombinant
luciferase-expressing virus, Murid Herpesvirus 4 (M3:luc MuHV-4),
at two times of day (Fig. 1A and Fig. S1A). As a rodent pathogen,
this virus elicits natural host immune responses and implements
evasion strategies in laboratory mice (11, 12), which allow it to
establish latent (or quiescent) infection after primary infection.
WT mice infected intranasally at the onset of resting phase
[Zeitgeber Time 0 (ZT0); lights on], exhibited 10-fold higher
viral replication than mice infected just before their active phase
(ZT10) (Fig. 1A). This time-of-day effect required a functional
clock because Bmal1–/– mice, which have no overt circadian
rhythms (2), showed no difference when infected at different times
(Fig. 1B and Fig. S1B). Furthermore, Bmal1–/– mice exhibited high
levels of MuHV-4 infection when inoculated at either time of day
(Fig. S1 C–F). Together, these results indicate that the timing of
infection in relation the circadian cycle has major effects on
herpesvirus pathogenesis.
Because infection of Bmal1–/– mice resulted in high levels of
virus replication in vivo (Fig. S1 D and F), we hypothesized that
its role in clock function was important in regulating virus
propagation. We therefore tracked M3:luc MuHV-4 infection
longitudinally in WT and Bmal1–/– mice, infecting intranasally at
ZT7: the time when BMAL1 is maximally active at genomic sites
in peripheral tissues (9). Strikingly, virus replication increased
Significance
The circadian clock coordinates our physiology. Circadian dis-
ruption, as occurs during shift work, increases the risk of chronic
diseases. For infectious diseases, circadian regulation of systemic
immunity seems to underpin “time-of-day” differences in re-
sponses to extracellular pathogens. However, circadian rhythms
are cell autonomous, and their interaction with intracellular
pathogens, such as viruses, is poorly understood. We demon-
strate that time of day of virus infection has a major impact on
disease progression, in cellular models as well as in animals,
highlighting the key role that cellular clocks play in this phe-
nomenon. Clock disruption leads to increased virus replication
and dissemination, indicating that severity of acute infections is
influenced by circadian timekeeping.

 greater than threefold at days 5–7 in Bmal1–/– mice compared
with WT mice (Fig. 2 A and B and Fig. S2A). We saw a similar
pattern when the acute infection spread to the superficial cer-
vical lymph nodes (SCLNs) (Fig. 2 A and B). By contrast, latent
infection was established to a similar extent in WT and Bmal1–/–
mice (Fig. S2 B and C).
To exclude that elevated infection levels were specific to
MuHV-4, we infected mice with a different herpesvirus, herpes
simplex virus 1 (HSV-1), by scarification of the left ear. We
tracked the progression and extent of HSV-1 infection using a
recombinant virus encoding luciferase under the control of the
cytomegalovirus immediate early gene promoter (CMV:luc HSV-1)
(13). Acute HSV-1 infection was significantly enhanced in ar-
rhythmic Bmal1–/– mice (Fig. 2 C and D and Fig. S2 D and E), as
with MuHV-4. As infection progressed, Bmal1–/– mice failed to
contain HSV-1 spread, which disseminated across the head to
the right ear (Fig. 2 C and D). As with MuHV-4, although acute
infection was more severe when circadian rhythms were dis-
rupted, latent infection was established to a similar extent in both
genotypes. Although apparent trends toward higher numbers of
latent viral genomes in Bmal1–/– mice was noted, this did not
reach statistical significance (Fig. S2F), suggesting that circadian
rhythms principally modulate primary infection in vivo.
A more vigorous immune response to incoming virus at the
onset of the active phase might oppose MuHV-4 infection at
ZT10 in vivo. We therefore investigated virus replication at dif-
ferent circadian times in synchronized cell models, which display
robust ∼24-h rhythms but are not subject to systemic immune
regulation (Fig. 3A). For our in vitro cellular clock model, we used
confluent monolayers in which there were limited numbers of
dividing cells, and no detectable circadian rhythm in cell cycle
activity after synchronization (Fig. S3 and Movie S1). We used
high resolution real-time bioluminescence recording to monitor
both M3:luc MuHV-4 replication kinetics and the amount of virus
replication (measured by total bioluminescence) correlated with
infectious particle production (Fig. 3B and Fig. S4 A–C). Strik-
ingly, when cell populations were infected with MuHV4 at dif-
ferent times in vitro, the time-of-day effect on infection observed
in mice was recapitulated (Fig. 3 C and D). Total bioluminescence
was significantly increased in cells infected during the rising phase
of Bmal1 expression (CT18–24, indicated by open arrowheads)
compared with cells infected during decline of Bmal1 expression
(CT30–36, indicated by solid arrowheads) (Fig. 3C). Moreover,
MuHV-4 infection at different times significantly altered the rate
of virus replication (Fig. 3D). Indeed, the entire kinetic profile of
infection depended on the circadian phase the virus encountered,
such that slower initial replication rates were associated with
prolonged viral gene expression [Fig. 3D and Fig. S4D; Pearson’s
r = 0.999 (first cycle) or r = 0.982 (second cycle), P < 0.01].
Moreover, in agreement with our in vivo observations, MuHV-
4 infection was significantly increased in primary Bmal1–/– fi-
broblasts compared with WT cells (Fig. 4 A and B and Movie S2).
When synchronized WT and Bmal1–/– fibroblasts were infected at
different circadian times (Fig. S5A; CT of infection indicated by
open and solid arrowheads), the time-of-day effect on MuHV-4
infection in WT cells was abolished in those from Bmal1–/– mice
(Fig. 4C and Fig. S5B). Additionally, HSV-1 replication was sig-
nificantly enhanced in Bmal1–/– cells compared with WT cells (Fig.
4 D and E and Movie S3). Thus, the cellular circadian clock exerts
a major effect on herpesvirus infection, indicating that our ob-
servations in live mice do not simply result from circadian mod-
ulation of immune cell function.
Given that cellular circadian rhythms impact on virus replica-
tion, we speculated that herpesviruses may manipulate the mo-
lecular clockwork during infection. To assess this, we infected
mouse NIH 3T3 cells, expressing luciferase under the control of
the Bmal1 promoter (Bmal:luc), with MuHV-4 at different circa-
dian times (Fig. 5A and Fig. S6A). Interestingly, MuHV-4 acutely
induced Bmal1 expression from ∼6 h after infection, irrespective
of the circadian phase at which the cells were infected (one-way
ANOVA: peak Bmal1:luc, P < 0.0001). The subsequent cellular
circadian rhythms during viral infection depended on the time at
which cells were infected. Virus-mediated Bmal1 induction during
the endogenous fall in Bmal1 transcription generated a Bmal1
peak and disrupted circadian reporter expression (infection at
CT18-24, indicated by open arrowhead in Fig. 5A and Fig. S5). In
contrast, viral induction at other times (infection at CT30–36;
indicated by solid arrowhead in Fig. 5A) enhanced the usual rise in
Bmal1 transcription, and cellular rhythms remained robust for
three cycles afterward (Fig. S6A). These findings strongly suggest
that induction of Bmal1 expression by herpesviruses has different
consequences for clock function depending on when in the circa-
dian cycle infection occurs.
Analogous to arrhythmic Bmal1–/– in vivo and cellular models,
enhanced viral replication was observed in cells infected at cir-
cadian times when endogenous circadian rhythms were sub-
sequently disrupted (Figs. 3 D and E and 5 A and B; indicated by
open arrowheads). In mouse peripheral tissues that support
herpesvirus replication, cellular CT24 corresponds to onset of
the rest (light) period (14), where rapid, higher levels of initial
replication would maximize the chance of transmission during
the subsequent active (dark) phase 12–24 h later. Cellular CT36
corresponds to the onset of the active period, when slower, lower
levels of replication would permit efficient transmission in the
following active phase 24–36 h later and perhaps reduce detection
at a time when the immune system is primed for pathogen attack.

Herpesvirus infection in mice is regulated by the circadian clock.
(A) WT female mice were intranasally infected with M3:luciferase Murid
Herpesvirus 4 (M3:luc MuHV-4) at Zeitgeber Time 0 (ZT0) (lights on; n = 6) or
at ZT10 (n = 6). Schematic illustrates Bmal1 mRNA levels and active (genome-

oculated at the onset of the resting phase (ZT0) compared with infection be-
fore the active phase (ZT10) [mean ± SEM; two-way ANOVA (ZT of infection ×

 Critically, expression of repressive clock genes, such as
mCryptochrome1 (mCry1) and mPeriod2 (mPer2), was not in-
duced during viral infection (Fig. 5C and Fig. S6B), but a
significant, rapid reduction was seen when cells were infected
at CT18 (Fig. 5C). These findings are consistent with MuHV-4
infection ushering cells from a repressive circadian phase to
one where BMAL1 is active, via sustaining Bmal1 expression
and relieving CRYPTOCHROME-mediated repression. Fur-
thermore, HSV-1 infection also acutely up-regulated Bmal1
(Fig. 5D), even more so than MuHV-4, suggesting that Bmal1
is specifically targeted by both α- and γ-herpesvirus families. In
support of this, Bmal1 expression is induced in cells overexpressing
viral transcriptional activators from either herpesviruses (Fig. S7),
and interactions between BMAL1/CLOCK and several HSV-1
transcriptional activators in vitro have been reported previ-
ously (15, 16).
Herpesviruses co-opt cellular transcriptional mechanisms to
replicate and target clock transcription factors (Fig. 5). We next
asked if the impact of BMAL1 ablation on viral infection ex-
tended beyond direct transcriptional regulation, to the global
changes in cellular physiology that occur when circadian rhythms
are disrupted. To investigate this, we infected WT and Bmal1−/−
cells with the orthomyxovirus, influenza A (IAV) (Fig. 6 A and
B). IAV replicates within the nucleus but encodes its own RNA-
dependent RNA polymerase and therefore does not directly use
the host cell’s transcriptional machinery for viral gene expres-
sion, in contrast to herpesviruses. Remarkably, loss of BMAL1
also significantly augmented IAV protein expression and replica-
tion (PB2::GLUC bioluminescence two-way ANOVA: genotype
effect, P = 0.0004; single-cycle growth two-way ANOVA: genotype
effect, P = 0.0102). The similar impact of cellular arrhythmicity on
two disparate, clinically relevant virus families implies a broader
influence of circadian clocks, and specific components such as
BMAL1, on viral infection.
To determine which cellular systems underpin the time-of-day
effect on viral replication, we first identified proteins that exhibit
changes in abundance between opposite circadian phases (CT18
vs. CT30) in WT cells, when viral replication in WT, but not in
Bmal1−/− cells, was significantly different (Fig. 4C). Given that
virus infection is augmented in Bmal1−/− cells at both time points
(Fig. 4C), we then focused on the subset of proteins within this
group whose abundance was either increased or decreased at both
of these times in Bmal1−/− cells compared with WT cells (Fig. 6 C
and D and Fig. S8). Circadian-regulated proteins expressed at
higher levels in Bmal1−/− cells were enriched for those involved in
protein biosynthesis (Fig. 6C, Fig. S8A, and Table S1), including
amino acid biosynthesis, ribosome structure, translation, and
protein folding clusters. Additionally, proteins involved in endo-
plasmic reticulum function, protein localization, and intracellular
vesicle trafficking were significantly enriched. These results in-
dicate that enhanced capability for viral protein biosynthesis, as-
sembly, and egress contribute to clock control of virus replication.
Conversely, circadian-regulated proteins expressed at lower levels
in Bmal1−/− cells were enriched for those involved in organiza-
tion of the cortical actin cytoskeleton and chromatin assembly
(Fig. 6D, Fig. S8B, and Table S2), suggesting that virus particle
uncoating, genome trafficking, and histone association con-
tribute to clock control of virus replication. Thus, clock-mediated
effects on viral infection in cells can be ascribed to discrete func-
tional categories of protein effectors targeting specific aspects of
the virus replication cycle.
Discussion
Our results show that altering only the time when hosts are in-
fected significantly affects the extent of virus infection and dis-
semination in vivo, reflecting the profound change in physiology
that naturally occurs over a day. Host circadian rhythms underpin
this phenomenon, because behaviorally arrhythmic mice show no

 such time-dependent differences. Indeed, the degree to which these
intracellular pathogens replicate is a function of circadian time in
isolated cells, without systemic circadian cues or host defenses.
For pathogens such as Plasmodia, which cause malaria, syn-
chronizing their replication cycle with host circadian rhythms
contributes to their success (17). Likewise, we speculate that
coevolution of viruses with their host clocks enables them to
capitalize on the predictability of daily rhythms driven by cell
autonomous molecular clocks. Comparable to our findings with
herpesviruses, rhythmic gene expression can persist during hep-
atitis C virus and influenza A virus infection, albeit with altered
circadian phase and amplitude (18, 19). Whether such changes to
host circadian rhythms enhance virus propagation between cells
or transmission between hosts are open questions.
A key feature of cellular clocks is their ability to synchronize to
external stimuli: initial time-of-day effects would be amplified if
dysregulated timekeeping cues perpetuate from infected to
neighboring uninfected cells. Our results strongly suggest that
herpesvirus and IAV replication increases in arrhythmic cells, as
demonstrated by virus-induced disruption at certain circadian
times or via loss of BMAL1. However, does this help or hinder
persistence at the level of the host or population? HSV-1 dis-
seminates more extensively in Bmal1−/− mice, for example, but
augmented primary productive replication may generate more
robust adaptive immune responses.
How do viruses engage with the molecular clockwork and
modulate timekeeping? At the simplest level, the circadian activity
of host metabolic and trafficking pathways places constraints on
replication. In turn, many viruses reprogram cellular metabolism,
which can feedback directly to the core clock mechanism. A more
intriguing possibility is that viruses actively gauge the cellular cir-
cadian phase via interaction with core clock components and ex-
ploit subsequent circadian variation in replication kinetics. The
HSV-1 viral transactivator infected cell polypeptide 0 (ICP0) is
thought to associate directly with BMAL1, whereas viral tran-
scription is driven by a complex containing CLOCK (15, 16, 20).
However, why not associate with CLOCK directly and why use
BMAL/CLOCK at all? The abundance of CLOCK does not os-
cillate, and its circadian function is bestowed via interaction with
BMAL1. We propose that herpesviruses recruit BMAL/CLOCK
to lock viral transcription to cellular circadian time.

 We found that ICP0 induces Bmal1 expression outside the con-
text of infection, implying that Bmal1 is specifically targeted, rather
than a cell-intrinsic innate immune response to infection. However,
this presents an apparent paradox, given that replication is enhanced
in the absence of BMAL1. Why induce a protein that appears to
exert an antiviral effect? Shifting cells from a repressive circadian
phase via concomitant acute induction of Bmal1 and mCry1 re-
pression likely stimulates replication. One straightforward expla-
nation is that chronic arrhythmicity in Bmal1−/− cells generates a
cellular environment less equipped to deal with viral challenge or
that baseline levels of BMAL1 contribute to cell intrinsic antiviral
immune responses (e.g., via IFN signaling). Examining viral
pathogenicity in alternate “clock knockout” genetic models and
in hosts subject to chronic circadian desynchrony will help disen-
tangle such possibilities. This apparent paradox additionally high-
lights the complex nature of circadian investigations, in that clock
proteins may be co-opted during virus replication in ways unrelated
to their timekeeping function (non-circadian effects). Therefore,
the global impact of circadian rhythmicity must be considered,
rather than the effect of individual clock components.
Our work does imply that constitutively low levels of BMAL1
lead to increased herpes and influenza A viral infection.
Remarkably, as well as its daily oscillation, Bmal1 expression
undergoes seasonal variation in human blood samples, with
lowest levels during the winter months (21). We speculate that
this may contribute to viral dissemination at the population level
because many viruses, including influenza, cause infection more
commonly in the winter (22). Given that global Bmal1 expression
is substantially lower in mouse models of circadian desynchro-
nization (23), our work also suggests that shift workers might be
more susceptible to viral disease and therefore prime candidates
for vaccination against viruses such as influenza. Indeed, timing
of influenza vaccine administration in the morning vs. afternoon

Virus infection differentially affects clock gene expression. (A) Bio-
luminescence recordings from synchronized Bmal1:luciferase (Bmal1:luc)
circadian reporter NIH 3T3 cells either mock infected or infected with MuHV-
4 at CT18 (open arrowhead) and CT30 (solid arrowhead). Mean baseline-
subtracted (detrended) bioluminescence (n = 3 per group) shown. Infection
at CT18 induced an additional peak in Bmal1:luc expression, disrupting
the circadian rhythm. Infection at CT30 induced Bmal1:luc that synergizes
with circadian Bmal1:luc expression and preserves rhythms. (B) Peak bio-
luminescence from synchronized Bmal1:luc cells either mock infected or in-
fected with MuHV-4 at 3-h intervals from CT18 to CT39 (mean ± SEM; n = 3).
Bmal1:luc expression is significantly increased, irrespective of the circadian
time of infection (one-way ANOVA P < 0.0001; post hoc multiple comparisons:
*P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001). For raw bioluminescence recordings
and error boundaries, see Fig. S6A. (C) Baseline-subtracted (detrended) bio-

Global proteomic comparison of WT and Bmal1−/− cells reveals clock-
regulated pathways that impact on viral replication. (A) Influenza A viral
protein expression was enhanced in Bmal1−/− cells. WT and Bmal1−/− cells
were infected with PB2::GLUC (Gaussia luciferase) influenza A virus (IAV) and
luciferase activity quantified at stated intervals. Rate of PB2 expression was
increased in Bmal1−/− compared with WT cells [mean ± SEM; n = 3; two-way
ANOVA (genotype × time postinfection): genotype effect, P = 0.0004; in-
teraction, P < 0.0001; post hoc multiple comparisons: *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01,
***P < 0.001), as was total PB2 expression (sigmoidal nonlinear regression:
WT R2 = 0.9902, Bmal−/− R2 = 0.9836; total PB2::GLUC bioluminescence (AUC)

enhanced in Bmal1−/− cells. IAV-infected cells were harvested and amount of
infectious IAV particles determined by plaque assay [two-way ANOVA (ge-
notype × time postinfection): genotype effect, *P = 0.0102]. (C) Synchro-

 has recently been shown to be a determinant in the systemic
immunization response in people aged >65 y (24). Beyond
this, acute manipulation of the molecular circadian clockwork
may provide a strategy for the development of novel antiviral
therapies.
Methods
Viruses. WT MuHV-4, M50 MuHV-4 (25), M3:luciferase (M3:luc) MuHV-4
(12), WT HSV-1, and CMV:luciferase (CMV:luc) HSV-1 (13) stocks were
grown in BHK21 cells and virus titer determined by plaque assay. PB2::
Gaussia luciferase (PB2::GLUC) influenza A virus (A/Puerto Rico/8/34 H1N1
IAV) was a kind gift from Nicholas Heaton and Peter Palese, Icahn School
of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York (26). SI Methods provides fur-
ther details.
Mice. Animal experimentation was licensed by the Home Office under the
Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986, with University of Cambridge Local
Ethical Review. Animals had ad libitum access to chow and water and were
maintained on 12-h light:12-h dark cycles, with lights on and lights off
designated ZT0 and ZT12, respectively. At stated ZTs, age-matched C57BL/6J
WT (Bmal1+/+) and Bmal1−/− mice were intranasally infected with 1 × 104
plaque-forming units (pfu) M3:luc MuHV-4 or 5 × 106 pfu CMV:luc HSV-1 by
left ear scarification. Bioluminescence imaging was performed with an IVIS
Lumina and analyzed using Living Image software (Caliper Life Sciences). See
SI Methods for further details.
Cell Culture and Bioluminescence Assays. Primary fibroblasts were generated
as described previously (27). Circadian transcriptional rhythms were
monitored using confluent NIH 3T3 fibroblasts (ATCC) transfected with
mPeriod2:luciferase, mCryptochrome1:luciferase, or Bmal1:luciferase
reporters and temporally synchronized by temperature cycles (32 °C:37 °C;
12 h:12 h) or 100 nM dexamethasone treatment (28). For comparison be-
tween in vivo and in vitro experiments, peak Bmal1:luc bioluminescence
was operationally designated as CT = 0/24 h. M3:luc MuHV-4 and CMV:luc
HSV-1 infections were performed at high multiplicity of infection (MOI =
1–3 pfu/cell). Bioluminescence was monitored using a LumiCycle-32 sys-
tem (Actimetrics) or Alligator Bioluminescence Incubator System (Cairn
Research). PB2::GLUC IAV (MOI = 2 pfu/cell) replication was assessed by
sampling medium at intervals postinfection and determining Gaussia
luciferase activity using a BioLux Kit (NEB E3300L). See SI Methods for
further details.
Proteomics. Synchronized, confluent primary WT and Bmal1−/− cells were
harvested at either CT = 18 h or CT = 30 h. Lysates were digested and labeled
with tandem mass tags (TMTs) according to the manufacturer’s instructions
(Thermo). Peptide mixtures were separated on a 50-cm, 75-μm-ID Pepmap
column over a 3-h gradient at 40 °C and eluted directly into the mass
spectrometer (Thermo Q Exactive Orbitrap). Xcalibur software was used to
control the data acquisition. MaxQuant v1.5.2.8 was used to process the raw
data acquired with a reporter ion quantification method (29). The Uniprot
KB database of mouse sequences was used for peptide identification [false
discovery rate (FDR) = 0.1%]. Two-tailed t tests were performed in Perseus
(FDR cutoff = 0.05; within-groups variance S0 factor = 0.1) to identify pro-
teins significantly different between CT18 and CT30 in WT cells, but not
Bmal1−/− cells. This group was then tested via two-tailed t test for significant
differences between WT and Bmal1−/− cells at both CT18 and CT30 (FDR
cutoff = 0.05), presented graphically in R using the HeatMap package and
subject to Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery
(DAVID) functional annotation clustering analysis. Outputs were graphically
presented using Cytoscape EnrichmentMap and annotated using Cluster-
maker Markov Cluster Algorithm and WordCloud (30, 31). See SI Methods
for further details.
Statistical Analysis. Unless otherwise stated, statistical analysis was performed
using Prism (GraphPad Software). Bioluminescence data were analyzed using
LumiCycle Data Analysis software (Actimetrics). See SI Methods for further
details.
