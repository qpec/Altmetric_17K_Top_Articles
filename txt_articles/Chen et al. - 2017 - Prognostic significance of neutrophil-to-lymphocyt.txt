ABSTRACT
Systemic inflammation responses can be reflected by peripheral blood count and 
combine index like the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte (NLR). The NLR has been reported 
to be a poor prognostic indicator in cancer recently. However, the prognostic effect 
of the NLR in patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) still unclear 
yet. We conducted this meta-analysis aiming to evaluate the pooled value of NLR 
in prognosis as well as clinical characteristics in malignant pleural mesothelioma. A 
total of 11 studies with 1533 patients were included in this meta-analysis, in which 
10 studies investigated the prognosis role of NLR using hazard ratio (HR) and 95% 
confidence intervals (95% CI). The elevated NLR was detected to be associated with 
a poor overall survival (OS)(HR=1.48, 95%CI=1.16-1.89, P < 0.001). The significant 
prognostic roles of NLR were also indicated in subgroup analyses. NLR level was also 
associated with histology instead of gender, stage or performance status (PS) score. 
These findings suggested that the elevated NLR could be a potential prognostic factor 
for malignant pleural mesothelioma patients and might be associated with histology 
as an efficient clinical index to stratify patients.
INTRODUCTION
Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is a high 
aggressive tumor originates from mesothelial surfaces 
with a poor prognosis and a median survival of 9 to 13 
months [1], and there were still no reliable prognostic 
indicators. Several prognostic biomarkers have been 
reported in the literature which including hemoglobin and 
white blood cell counts, performance status according to 
the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) scale, 
age, weight loss, disease stage and imaging results (tumor 
volume, metabolic activity) to distinguish patients with 
good prognosis from those with inferior outcomes [2, 3]. 
Although these results for the prognosis helpful, but they 
were far from enough to predict the survival outcomes. 
Therefore, studies to further identify novel prognostic 
factors associated with accuracy and efficiency calls for 
the exertion of clinicians.
Inflammatatory responses have been found 
associated with tumor progression, evidence also shown 
that increased systemic inflammation was associated 
with poor overall survival (OS) in numerous types of 
cancer [4-9]. Inflammation is a crucial component of 
tumor microenvironment [8]. Inflammatory cells in the 
tumor microenvironment have important effects on tumor 
development, and markers of systemic inflammation 
may provide significant information for prognostication. 
Accumulating evidence suggested inflammation-related 
cells correlated closely with cancer are including 
neutrophils [10, 11], platelets [12], and lymphocytes [13]. 
Neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), calculated as a 
simple ratio between neutrophil and lymphocyte counts, an 
index of systemic inflammation, has been related to poor 
survival for a variety of malignant tumors as renal cell 
carcinoma, colorectal cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, 
prostate cancer and gastric cancer [14-18].

Therefore, it is a reasonable assumption that these 
two factors together might be applied as a prognostic 
factor. Here, we conducted a meta-analysis aiming to 
further verify the pooled prognostic value of NLR in 
malignant pleural mesothelioma.
RESULTS
Study characteristics and qualities
The flow chart of selection process was shown in 
Figure 1. We initially retrieved 380 studies in total without 
duplicates. After further screening, 365 studies were 
excluded for conference abstracts, case reports, reviews, 
or studies unrelated to this meta-analysis. Then, 15 studies 
were identified for the next step of evaluation with full 
text. During the further analysis, 4 studies [19, 20, 21, 22] 
were ruled out because they were failed to present specific 
NLR data for OS, not available in neither univariate 
nor multivariate analysis, or failed to estimate via 
sufficient information for HR and 95%CI, or studies with 
overlapping patients. Thus, finally 11 studies with 1533 
patients were included in our meta-analysis, in which 10 
studies [23-32] valuated the association between NLR and 
survival of malignant pleural mesothelioma patients, four 
study [23, 27, 29, 31] were included for investigation of 
NLR and patients’ clinical characteristics. The publication 
time ranged from 2010 to 2016. The ethnicities of the 
studies contained Asian and Caucasian. We extracted HR 
and 95%CI from multivariate analysis in seven studies and 
univariate analysis in three studies. All included studies 
reported data for OS. The study quality was evaluated via 
Newcastle-Ottawa scale, and the scores of the 11 studies 
ranged from 6 to 8. The main characteristics were shown 
in Table 1.

NLR and survival
There were 7 studies with multivariate analysis and 
3 studies with univariate analysis providing information 
regarding OS. Overall, an elevated NLR was significantly 
associated with a poor OS (HR=1.48, 95%CI=1.16-
1.89, P=0.001)(Figure 2). The significance was detected 
in studies with multivariate analysis (HR=1.50, 
95%CI=1.15-1.95, P=0.003). We further detected a 
significant association between NLR and OS in studies 
with Caucasian population (HR=1.44, 95%CI=1.11-1.86, 
P=0.006), larger sample size (HR=1.58, 95%CI=1.07-
2.35, P=0.022), higher study quality (HR = 1.579, 
95%CI=1.12-2.22, P=0.009) and cut-off value of five 
(HR=1.68, 95%CI=1.10-2.56, P=0.015). The detailed 
results were shown in Table 2 and the extracted data were 
presented in Supplementary table S1.
NLR and clinical characteristics
As for clinical characteristics, we detected NLR 
level was associated with histology (odds ratio (OR)=0.59, 
95%CI=0.40-0.86, P=0.005), patients with non-epithelioid 
histological subtype are more likely in an elevated NLR. 
However, we failed to observe the association between 
NLR level with gender, tumor stage and performance 
status (PS) score. These results were presented in Table 3 
and detailed extracted data were shown in Supplementary 
table S2.
Sensitivity analysis and publication bias
Sensitivity analysis was performed and we did not 
observe any variations of the results, which proved the 
stability of results of our meta-analysis (Figure 3). In 
addition, The Begg’s funnel plot (Pr>|z|=0.474) (Figure 
4a) and the Egger’s test (P>|t|=0.237) (Figure 4b) did not 
detected any evidence of publication bias for OS, as well 
as for clinical characteristics.
DISCUSSION
Systemic inflammatory response is important in 
cancer progresssion [33]. Inflammation-relatated cells 
involved in the constitution and regulation of tumer cell 
microenvironment. It may act as an intermediary between

tumor cell and inflammatory. Different peripheral blood 
count may reflect the body’s inflammatory response, 
and NLR as an combined index may reflect the balance 
between neutrophils and immunocytes, making it a 
prognostic factor. Several studies have demonstrated that 
elevated NLR is related with a poor prognosis in MPM, 
but the result still controversial. Thus we conducted this 
meta-analysis and it was the first to indicate that a high 
NLR was associated with poor survival of patients with 
MPM.

Similar to our study, a recent clinical research 
published in 2016 investigated the relation between 
NLR and malignant pleural mesothelioma [22]. In their 
research they collected and analysised 36 patients’ clinical 
information, and didn’t detect any significant correlation 
bettwen NLR and MPM prognosis. Thus we could find 
that NLR on prognosis of patients with malignant pleural 
mesothelioma was still a question worth exploring. These 
studies just as we mentioned above, might not be able to 
draw reliable conclusions with the limitation of sample 
size. Our research using the method of meta-analysis 
contained a larger sample size, and might be more credible 
and provide more reliable information compared to other 
single clinical research.
Base on the result of our meta-analysis, we found 
that an elevated NLR was significantly associated 
with a poor OS. Furthermore, results were proved 
in subgroup analysis stratified by ethnicity, study 
design, suvival analysis, cut-off value and NOS score. 
In addition, relationship between NLR and clinical 
characters including histology, gender, tomur stageand 
performance status (PS) score were also accessed. NLR 
level was associated with histology of malignant pleural 
mesothelioma that it was higher in patients with a 
nonepithelioid histological subtype. However, we failed to 
detected any association between NLR level with gender, 
tumor stage and performance status (PS) score.
Our study were in correspondence with previous 
studies which investigated the prognosis value of NLR in 
other kind of tumors such as liver cancer [34], colorectal 
cancer [35], pancreatic cancer [36], etc. These study 
also demonstrated that an elevated NLR was important 
in predicting prognosis before treatment. Thus it was 
believed to be a promising marker playing role in cancer 
diagnosis, prognosis prediction and individual treatment 
in future. However, the optimal cut-off value for NLR in 
predicting the prognosis of gastric cancer remains unclear 
[37]. The cut-off values in our analysis ranged from 3 to 
5, and they were determined by the median value of all 
patients, or on the basis of previous studies. To establish 
a suitable cut-off value, we performed subgroup analyses 
with the cut-off values. Most included studies applied five 
as cut-off value and significant survival outcomes were 
detected in subgroup stratified patients by five.
Our results were not consistent with some published 
studies, we didn’t find the association between NLR 
level and tumor stage. A possible explanation for this 
might be that the degree of inflamation is different 
from patients in different tumor stage. Several studies 
had shown that malignant pleural tumors were always 
secondary to asbestosis exposion, and early pleural tumors 
were more easily associated with acute infection and 
inflammation effusion. By contrast, the chance of acute 
inflammatory response in advanced pleural tumor patients 
is less. Unfortunately, patients with the presence of active 
infection were more likely to be excluded from the study 
in patients selection process, which may lead to a negative 
result. More studies were warranted on this filed in future.
Our study has some limitations. First, although 
we made comprehensive search, there were only 11 
studies included and the limited patients numbers may 
have influence on the outcomes, thus futher studies at 
a large scale might be needed to confirm the prognosis 
value of NLR in MPM. In addiation, heterogeneity was 
a potential problem that may reduce the accurary of the 
results. Difference in baseline features of included studies 
such as histology, treatment, cut-off value of NLR and 
follow-up period, etc might potentially have influence in 
pooled results. Finally, some original articles evaluated the 
prognostic effect of NLR in univariate analysis, whereas 
others had data of multivariate analysis, which may 
contribute to some bias of the pooled data.
In conclusion, our study demonstrated that the 
elevated NLR predicted poor survival of MPM. And NLR 
also might be associated with histology of MPM. The 
NLR could be useful for predicting survival of patients 
with MPM. Further studies were warranted to conform the 
exact value of NLR in the prognosis of MPM.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Search strategy
A systemic search was conducted in PubMed, 
Embase and web of Science databases update to Jun 26, 
2016. The following words were applied as search terms: 
“neutrophil-to-lymphocyte”, 
“neutrophil-lymphocyte 
ratio”, “neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio”, “NLR”, “malignant 
pleural mesothelioma”, “malignant mesothelioma”, 
“pleural mesothelioma”, “MPM”, “MM”. There was no 
language restriction of our literature search. The references 
of identified articles were retrieved manually for potential 
eligible studies.
Inclusion and exclusion criteria
Studies met the following criteria were considered 
eligible: (1) the studies investigated the association 
between NLR and prognosis or clinical characteristics of 
MPM patients; (2) for prognosis, hazard ratio (HR) and 
95% CI were reported, or Kaplan-Meier curve and relevant 
information were available to estimate HR and 95% CI. 
(3) for clinical characteristics, odds ratio (OR) and 95% 
CI were used to measure the association. We excluded 
studies if they: (1) were conference abstracts, letters, case 
reports; (2) failed to report failed to present specific NLR 
data for OS in neither univariate nor multivariate analysis, 
or failed to estimate via sufficient information for HR and 
95%CI, or NLR as a continue variable; (3) presented to 
be duplicate publications. When studies with overlapping 
 Oncotarget

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget
patients were met, only the study with the most patients 
was included. Two investigators (Nan Chen and Shuai 
Liu) reviewed the identified studies independently and a 
final discussion was launched to reach a consistency.
Data extraction and quality assessment
Two investigators(Nan Chen and Lin Huang) 
extracted information independently using a standard 
data extraction table. The following information were 
recorded for each included study: name of first author, 
year of publication, ethnicity, number of recruited patients, 
treatment of patient, follow-up time, analysis method, type 
of survival, cut-off value for NLR, clinical characteristics 
information, HR and 95% CI for survival. The Newcastle-
Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale (NOS) was used to 
assess the quality of each included study independently 
by these two investigators. NOS score more than 6 were 
considered as high-quality studies. The two investigators 
discussed to reach a consensus when there was any 
disagreement. The Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment 
Scale (NOS) we used was shown in Supplementary table 
S3 and the detailed scores of each included study was 
presented in Supplementary table S4.
Statistics analysis
In this meta-analysis, OR with 95%CI was used 
to evaluate the association between NLR and clinical 
characteristics. As for prognosis, HR and 95%CI were 
extracted from each study to calculate the pooled HR 
(high level vs. low level). When the study reported both 
univariate and multivariate results, we chose multivariate 
analysis for final calculation. While the HR and 95%CI 
were not reported directly, Kaplan-Meier curve and 
relevant data were collected to estimate related HR 
with 95%CI. Test of heterogeneity was conducted by 
Cochran’s Q test and Higgins I-squared statistic. P>0.10 
and I2<50% were regarded as no significant heterogeneity 
and the fixed-effects model was used. Otherwise, the 
random-effects model was applied. In addition, further 
subgroup analyses to explore potential heterogeneity 
were performed stratified by ethnicity, sample size, study 
design, survival analysis, NOS score and cut-off value. We 
further conducted sensitivity to evaluate the stability of the 
results. Additionally, Begg’s funnel plot and Egger’s linear 
regression tests were performed to access publication bias. 
All the analyses were carried out by STATA 12.0 (STATA 
Corporation, College Station, TX, USA).
