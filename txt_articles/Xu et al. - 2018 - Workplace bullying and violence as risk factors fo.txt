Abstract
Aims/hypothesis The aim of this multicohort study was to
examine whether employees exposed to social stressors at
work, such as workplace bullying and violence, have an in-
creased risk of type 2 diabetes.
Methods The study included 45,905 men and women (40–
65 years of age and free of diabetes at baseline) from four
studies in Sweden, Denmark and Finland. Workplace bullying
and violence were self-reported at baseline. Incident diabetes
was ascertained through national health and medication re-
cords and death registers. Marginal structural Cox models
adjusted for age, sex, country of birth, marital status and edu-
cational level were used for the analyses.
Results Nine per cent of the population reported being bullied
at work and 12% were exposed to workplace violence or
threats of violence. Bullied participants had a 1.46 (95% CI
1.23, 1.74) times higher risk of developing diabetes compared
with non-bullied participants. Exposure to violence or threats
of violence was also associated with a higher risk of diabetes
(HR 1.26 [95% CI 1.02, 1.56]). The risk estimates attenuated
slightly when taking BMI into account, especially for bully-
ing. The results were similar for men and women, and were
consistent across cohorts.
Conclusions/interpretation We found a higher risk of incident
type 2 diabetes among employees exposed to bullying or vi-
olence in the workplace. Further research is needed to deter-
mine whether policies to reduce bullying and violence at work
may reduce the incidence of type 2 diabetes in working pop-
ulations. Research on the mechanisms is also highly
warranted.

Introduction
Recent meta-analyses have suggested that psychosocial work
characteristics, such as job insecurity [1] and long working
hours [2], are associated with a moderately higher risk of
diabetes, while the health effects of highly adverse social work
stressors, such as bullying and violence at work, are far less
well documented. The prevalence of workplace bullying, de-
fined as persistent, repeated harassing, offending and socially
excluding behaviours of psychological nature over a long pe-
riod [3], ranges from 5% to 24% depending on the country [4].
The prevalence of violence and threats of violence also vary
between countries, but are generally more common in occu-
pations with client contact; for example, 19.9% of nurses in
the USA have reported exposure to violence and threats of
violence at work [5].
Bullying and violence can adversely affect personal re-
sources, such as self-esteem and coping capacity [3]. They
have also been linked with an increased risk of chronic con-
ditions, including type 2 diabetes [6], which is characterised
by insulin resistance in liver and muscle and progressive beta
cell failure [7]. Induced negative emotions, such as depression
and anxiety [8, 9], may contribute to diabetes risk [10] through
prolonged activation of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal
axis and sympathetic nervous system, or indirectly through
impaired sleep, for example [11]. Furthermore, stress-related
coping strategies, such as comfort eating behaviour with an
increased preference for energy and nutrient dense foods [12],
may result in weight gain or an increase in waist circumfer-
ence [13], which are both pivotal risk factors for diabetes [14].
However, it is unknown whether bullying or violence at
work affects diabetes risk in the general population. To the
best of our knowledge, the only existing study on negative
interpersonal relations and diabetes was a cross-sectional
study of 8499 male and 9025 female employees in the USA
in 2015. It postulated a higher prevalence of type 2 diabetes
among employees exposed to workplace bullying, threats or
other kinds of harassment compared with those who were not
exposed to these social stressors [15]. However, due to the
cross-sectional study design, the temporality of the association
is unclear. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to
assess the prospective relationship between bullying and vio-
lence at work and the risk of incident type 2 diabetes using
longitudinal individual-level data from four large Nordic co-
hort studies involving more than 40,000 participants.
Methods
Study baseline The study population was derived from four
prospective cohort studies including the Swedish Work
Environment Survey (SWES) [16], the Swedish
Longitudinal Occupational Survey of Health (SLOSH) [17],
the Finnish Public Sector Study (FPS) [18] and the Danish
Work Environment Cohort Study (DWECS) [19]. For more
details on the individual cohorts, please see the electronic
supplementary material (ESM Study populations). Ethical ap-
proval was obtained from the Regional Ethical Review Board
in Stockholm for SWES and SLOSH, and the Ethics
Committee of the Hospital District of Helsinki and Uusimaa
for FPS. In Denmark, questionnaire- and register-based stud-
ies do not require ethics committee approval. DWECS was
approved by and registered with the Danish Data Protection
Agency.
Our baseline sample was restricted to participants with in-
formation on either workplace bullying or violence at baseline
(Fig. 1). We only included those who were employed and aged
between 40 and 65 years. Participants younger than 40 years
of age were excluded in order to minimise outcome misclas-
sification of type 1 diabetes and polycystic ovary syndrome
[20]. Those who were previously diagnosed with diabetes or
had previously used glucose-lowering medications or insulin
were excluded. Our final sample included 19,280 men and
26,625 women.
Workplace bullying and violence Being bullied or targeted
by violent actions or threats of violence was measured using
questionnaires with similar wording in all cohorts. We defined
workplace bullying as reporting having been bullied at the
workplace at least once during the past 12 months (in
SWES, SLOSH and DWECS). In FPS, the time frame was
slightly different as participants were asked whether they were
currently being bullied. Workplace violence was measured as
the experience of having been the target of violent actions or
threats of violence in the past 12 months at the workplace (in
SWES, SLOSH and DWECS). Violence was not measured in
FPS; therefore, this cohort was not included in the analysis of
violence. Participants were further identified as ‘frequently
exposed’ if the bullying/violence occurred at least once a
week. Detailed information on measurements and definitions
of workplace bullying and violence can be found in ESM
Table 1.
Type 2 diabetes Using unique personal identification num-
bers in Sweden, Finland and Denmark, all participants were
linked to nationwide health registers. We used available
76
Diabetologia (2018) 61:75–83
 information for each country and at different historical time
points to capture all incidences of diabetes. Type 2 diabetes
was identified with codes ICD-8/9 250 and ICD-10 E11
(www.who.int/classifications/icd/en/) from inpatient registers
only (in SWES95-01 and FPS) or both inpatient and outpa-
tient registers (in SWES07, SLOSH and DWECS) and com-
bined with information from death registers (in all cohorts).
This was supplemented with information on prescription med-
ication using Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical codes A10A,
A10B and A10X (in SWES07, SLOSH and FPS). In
DWECS, individuals were identified in the Danish Diabetes
Register, which combines information from the national pa-
tient register on the use of insulin or oral glucose-lowering
drugs, registration for chiropody for treatment of diabetes-
related complications and individuals with more than five
blood glucose measurements within the period of a year
[21]. For the individuals receiving insulin treatment, this reg-
ister includes both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. However, as all
participants were free from diabetes at baseline at an age of at
least 40 years, type 2 diabetes probably represents the majority
of these individuals.
Other variables Potential confounders were identified based
on prior knowledge and using directed acyclic graphs [22]. In
addition to age and sex, potential confounders included country
of birth, educational level and marital status. Information on
educational level was obtained from the social registers in each
country and was categorised as ≤9 years, 10–12 years and
≥13 years. Marital status, as a proxy for social support outside
work, was also obtained from the population registers (in
SWES, SLOSH and DWECS) or self-reported questionnaires
(in FPS). It was categorised as unmarried, married/cohabiting,
divorced/separated or widowed. Country of birth was self-
reported and classified as ‘Nordic countries’, ‘other European
countries’ and ‘other continents’ (in SWES, SLOSH and
DWECS). Country of birth was not measured in FPS, but the
vast majority of hospital employees in the cohort are from
Nordic countries. We assumed that mental illness, excessive
alcohol consumption and obesity would be on the causal path-
way from bullying or violence to type 2 diabetes (and thus
should not be controlled for). However, mental illness, excessive
alcohol consumption and obesity may also be causes of work-
place bullying and violence, and thus confounders. Therefore,
we chose to include adjustment for BMI, alcohol consumption
and mental illness in sensitivity analyses. BMI (in SLOSH,
DWECS and FPS) was calculated using self-reported height
and weight, grouping according to the WHO categories: under-
weight (<18.5 kg/m2), normal (18.5–24.9 kg/m2), overweight
(25–29.9 kg/m2) and obese (≥30 kg/m2). Information for alcohol
consumption was available in FPS, DWECS and SLOSH.
Alcohol consumption was divided into ‘risky’ or ‘non-risky’
based on exceeding or not exceeding 16/24 (in FPS) or 14/21
(in DWECS and SLOSH) alcohol units (12 g of alcohol per unit)
per week for women/men, or weekly consumption of six or
more units per occasion (in SLOSH). Mental illness was identi-
fied using only inpatient registers (in SWES95-01 and FPS) or
both inpatient and outpatient registers (in SWES07, SLOSH and
DWECS), and dichotomised into having at least one mental
illness problem and having no mental illness. Furthermore,
workplace violence is very likely to be clustered in occupations
with frequent client contact. Thus, we separated personal and
protective service workers, healthcare professionals, social work
professionals and teaching professionals from other occupations
using the current Swedish and Danish adapted version of the
International Standard Classification of Occupations (ISCO-
88) following suggestions from Madsen et al [23].
Statistical analysis Data from the individual cohorts were
analysed separately. The cohort-specific results were later
combined using meta-analyses. Two datasets with slightly dif-
ferent numbers of participants were created for each cohort for
the analyses of bullying and violence, excluding participants
with information missing for any of the covariates (Fig. 1). For
the sensitivity analyses including SLOSH, FPS and DWECS,
participants with missing information for BMI (in the BMI-
adjusted analyses) or both BMI and alcohol consumption (in
the BMI- and alcohol-adjusted analyses) were excluded.
For the main analyses we applied a marginal structural Cox
model estimated by using inverse probability (IP) weights [24].
This approach is based on a counterfactual framework. Given the
properly identified confounders, the method provides an estimate
of the marginal HR. This corresponds to comparing the risk of
diabetes in a pseudo population where everyone is bullied with
the same population where everyone is not bullied. Our main
analyses were conducted in three steps. In step one, the stabilised
IP weight was obtained for each individual included by fitting a
logistic model for the conditional probability of being exposed
based on relevant confounders in each analysis [24]. In this step,
the positivity assumption was verified in all of the analyses. Step
two was to fit weighted Cox proportional hazard models using
age as the underlying timescale. The IP weights varied depend-
ing on whether the Cox proportional hazard models were age-
and sex-adjusted or fully adjusted. The proportional hazards
assumption was tested using log (-log(survival)) curves. If a
result was doubtable, a stratified Cox model was performed to
confirm the violation. In our study, none of the violations were of
major concern. In step three, the robust confidence interval was
calculated using standard errors generated from bootstrapping
steps one and two a total of 500 times.
Sensitivity analyses based on specific IP weights suitable
for each analysis were conducted on: (1) sex-stratified analy-
ses; (2) analyses adjusting for BMI; (3) analyses adjusting for
both BMI and alcohol consumption; (4) analyses adjusting for
mental illness, in addition to the main adjustments; (5) analy-
ses only including the first 4 years of follow-up in order to test
whether the effect was dependent on length of follow-up; (6)
Diabetologia (2018) 61:75–83
77
 analyses considering a one year washout period to address the
possibility of reversed causality; (7) analyses based on differ-
ent definitions of diabetes (inpatient plus death vs inpatient
plus medication plus death vs inpatient plus outpatient plus
death); (8) analyses to test a potential dose–response relation-
ship between frequency of exposure to bullying/violence and
risk of type 2 diabetes in cohorts with available information on
frequency of exposure (in SLOSH and SWES); and (9) further
stratified analysis for violence towards individuals in occupa-
tions with frequent client contact (in SLOSH, SWES and
DWECS).
To adjust for the small number of studies included, the risk
estimates from each cohort were combined in the fixed-effect
meta-analyses [25]. The I2 statistic was used to test for hetero-
geneity between the study-specific estimates. All tests of sta-
tistical significance were two-sided and the significance level
was set at 0.05 using SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary,
NC, USA) and R package ‘meta’ version 4.8-2.
Results
Baseline characteristics Nine per cent of the participants re-
ported exposure to bullying at work (Table 1). The prevalence
of bullying varied between studies, with the highest preva-
lence observed in SLOSH (13%). The combined analysis on
workplace bullying included 45,647 participants (26,396
women and 19,251 men).
Twelve per cent of the participants had experienced vio-
lence or threats of violence at work within the past 12 months
(Table 1). This proportion varied between the cohorts, with the
highest prevalence reported in SLOSH (17%) and the lowest
in DWECS (7%). There was no information on workplace
violence reported for FPS. Therefore, the analyses on work-
place violence were based on the 39,574 participants from the
remaining three cohorts, including 21,023 women and 18,551
men. The prevalence of violence varied greatly between dif-
ferent occupations. The highest prevalence of violence or
threats of violence were found among occupations with fre-
quent client contact, including social work professionals
(>46%), personal and protective service workers (>29%),
healthcare professionals (>25%) and teaching professionals
(>16%).
Only 2–4% of participants reported exposure to both work-
place bullying and violence, and there was very little statistical
agreement between the two measures across all the included
cohorts (Cohen’s κ < 0.20).
Workplace bullying and type 2 diabetes During a mean
follow-up of 11.7 years, we identified 1223 incident cases of
type 2 diabetes. After adjustment, being bullied at work was
associated with a higher risk of type 2 diabetes (HR 1.46 [95%
CI 1.23, 1.74]; Fig. 2). The risk estimates varied across the stud-
ies but, apart from a very unstable estimate from SWES07 (based
on only 131 incident type 2 diabetes events), they were all in the
same direction and there was no indication of heterogeneity

 also did not change the risk estimate (ESM Fig. 2). Further, when
limiting our analysis to the first 4 years of follow-up the risk
estimate remained similar to that of the main analysis (HR 1.37
[95% CI 0.99, 1.88]). In addition, a one year washout period or
differences in case ascertainment across the studies did not
change the risk estimate (Fig. 2).
The two Swedish cohorts (SWES and SLOSH) provided
information on the frequency of bullying. Of those who were
bullied, 10% reported being bullied frequently (i.e. at least
once a week) and 90% reported being bullied occasionally.
Compared with those who had not experienced bullying in
the past 12 months, those who had experienced bullying oc-
casionally had a higher risk of type 2 diabetes (HR 1.57 [95%
CI 1.23, 1.99]), whereas those who experienced bullying fre-
quently did not have a clear excess risk of type 2 diabetes (HR
1.24 [95% CI 0.58, 2.64]) (based on only seven incident cases
of type 2 diabetes in the frequently bullied group).
Workplace violence and type 2 diabetes During a mean
follow-up of 11.4 years, we identified 930 incident cases of type
2 diabetes in the three cohorts used for the analyses on violence.
After adjusting for age, sex, educational level, marital status and
country of birth, workplace violence or threats of violence were
associated with a higher risk of type 2 diabetes (HR 1.26 [95%
CI 1.02, 1.56]) (Fig. 3). The risk estimates varied slightly be-
tween the different studies but there was no indication of het-
erogeneity across the studies (I2 < 0.1%) (Fig. 3). In addition, no
obvious differences between men and women were revealed.
Additional adjustment for BMI slightly changed the risk esti-
mate from 1.33 (95% CI 1.00, 1.78) to 1.27 (95% CI 0.96, 1.70).
Further adjustments for alcohol consumption and mental illness
did not affect the risk estimate (ESM Figs 1, 2). Moreover, the
risk estimate was not influenced by the follow-up length (Fig. 3).
The test for different outcome ascertainment showed no differ-
ence using various case ascertainment methods (Fig. 3).
In the analysis of the dose–response relationship (based on
SLOSH and SWES), among those experiencing violence at
work, 17% were targeted by workplace violence frequently (at
least once a week; 12 incident cases of type 2 diabetes in this
group) and 83% were occasionally exposed (68 incident cases
of type 2 diabetes in this group). Neither occasional (HR 1.18
[95% CI 0.94, 1.50]) nor frequent exposure to violence (HR
0.95 [95% CI 0.52, 1.76]) was clearly associated with an in-
creased risk of type 2 diabetes.
In addition, we observed a similar excess risk for occupa-
tions with (HR 1.20 [95% CI 0.90, 1.60]) and without frequent
client contact (HR 1.36 [95% CI 1.03, 1.81]).
Discussion
In this large multinational, multicohort study, approximately
one in ten employees reported being exposed to bullying or
violence/threats of violence at work. Both men and women
who were exposed to these severe social stressors were at a
higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes. The higher risk was
consistent across cohorts and independent of follow-up length
or the method of case ascertainment. When we adjusted for
BMI, the associations were attenuated but remained statisti-
cally significant in the case of bullying and suggestive in the
case of violence. These findings add to the previous cross-
sectional study by Khubchandani et al that reported a risk
estimate (OR 1.48 [95% CI 1.03, 2.15]) that is similar to our
findings but is based on a less specific definition of bullying
that included being harassed, threatened or bullied any time in
the past 12 months [15].
We did not find a dose–response relationship trend for work-
place bullying. The point estimate for those being frequently
bullied was lower than those being occasionally bullied. This
may be due to a very limited number of incident diabetes events
in the frequently bullied group generating a very wide confidence
interval. However, we did not find a dose–response relationship
for workplace violence either. Occupations with frequent client
contact can be a proxy of frequent workplace violence [23];
however, the point estimate was similar between occupations
with frequent client contact and those without. A possible expla-
nation for the lack of a dose–response relationship here could be
a protective effect from general expectations and/or training prior
to workplace violence among employees in occupations with
frequent client contact [26]. It may also be attributable to cogni-
tive adaption including finding meaning, enhancing self and
gaining mastery [27] following frequent exposure.
Bullying vs violence Our results suggest that while both bul-
lying and violence represent negative interpersonal relation-
ships they most probably constitute different concepts, with
only 2–4% of participants reporting being exposed to both,
and very poor statistical agreement indicating that bullying
and violence are two distinct social stressors. Harassment
and bullying refer to psychological aggression, including be-
haviours such as unfair criticisms, humiliating work tasks,
isolation, ignorance and spreading rumours [3]. Violence or
threats of violence on the other hand are more likely to be
understood as physical violence or verbal threats relating to
physical violence [28], and the actions included can be exem-
plified as pushing, kicking and screaming [29]. There can be
situations where behaviours displaying bullying and violent
characteristics overlap, especially when the negative behav-
iour of concern has been observed to persist and be repeated
over a long period [3]. However, in most situations, bullying
at work is often characterised by negative behaviours from
colleagues and supervisors, sometimes also from clients
[30], whereas the overwhelming proportion of violence at
work is derived from clients, students, customers, patients,
etc [29]. Hence, workplace bullying and workplace violence
seem to be distinct behaviours and, consequently, their
80

 induced emotions can be different. However, the associated
behavioural appraisals and physiological reactions may be
similar and may explain the comparable associations with risk
of diabetes observed in the present study.
Plausible pathways Being bullied is regarded as a severe
social stressor that may activate the stress response system
and lead to a range of downstream biological processes that
may contribute towards the risk of diabetes [31]. In agreement
with this, bullying at work has, for example, been found to be
related to a higher level of saliva dehydroepiandrosterone sul-
phate [32], although no increase in saliva cortisol has been
documented [33] and there is no clear finding from longitudi-
nal studies on stress biomarkers [34]. Nevertheless, these hor-
mones may work together in affecting cellular activities and
metabolic, cardiovascular and immune variables [15, 35].
Metabolic changes and obesity are also possible mechanisms
underlying the observed higher risk of type 2 diabetes associ-
ated with both bullying and violence, as stress responses may
be related to the endocrine regulation of appetite [36]. In the
present study, the relationships between bullying and violence
and type 2 diabetes attenuated after adjustment for baseline
BMI, which can either be due to the fact that obese employees
are more likely to be targets for workplace bullying or vio-
lence or that exposed employees are more likely to gain
weight and become obese. The first explanation (i.e. that obe-
sity leads to bullying) was, however, not supported in a sen-
sitivity analysis presented in a previous paper on bullying and
cardiovascular disease based on data from the FPS study,
where the authors did not find an association between baseline
BMI and incident workplace bullying [37]. On the other hand,
it is likely that both workplace bullying and violence can in-
duce comfort eating behaviour [12] or increase the risk of
experiencing negative emotions [8, 26, 38], and further con-
tribute to weight gain and subsequent development of type 2
diabetes, making the causal pathway very plausible.
Methodological considerations The exposure measurements
differed slightly between the studies, especially the measure-
ments from FPS, as in this study bullying is defined as

 ‘currently being bullied’ rather than bullying experienced in
the past 12 months. Furthermore, workplace bullying was
self-reported without providing a definition, which did not
reflect the formal definition of persistent or repeated events
[3]. According to a meta-analysis on measurement of work-
place bullying in Nordic countries [4], the provision of a def-
inition did not impact prevalence, presumably because the
concept of bullying at schools and workplaces is well
established. However, in this study, given the subjectivity of
solely using a self-reporting method, it is possible that our
results are, to some extent, affected by exposure misclassifi-
cation. Furthermore, workplace bullying and violence were
only measured at baseline, ignoring the possibility of changes
in exposure status over time [39], which may have diluted our
results.
The incidence of type 2 diabetes was smaller in SWES95-
01 compared with the other cohorts. This difference may be
mainly ascribed to the fact that SWES95-01 could not be
linked to the medication register. However, a meta-analysis
is a robust tool with which to incorporate such variations. It
is reassuring that although the association in FPS is possibly
diluted by using a narrower exposure window it showed a
similar risk estimate and direction as the other cohorts.
Type 2 diabetes was ascertained differently across coun-
tries and at different historical time points, leading to some
degree of misclassification. We chose to use the most compre-
hensive definition in each study to reduce outcome misclassi-
fication, which came at the cost of direct comparability in
incidence rates across studies. However, when standardising
case ascertainment across the studies in the sensitivity analy-
ses, we found no obvious heterogeneity for the risk estimates
dependent on case ascertainment method, suggesting that such
misclassification is not a major source of bias. In addition, we
have considered several important confounders. However, in
observational settings, unmeasured confounders are unavoid-
able, e.g. personality and genetic factors. Thus, our results
should be interpreted with caution.
To the best of our knowledge, no previous longitudinal
studies have addressed the relationships between workplace
bullying and workplace violence and type 2 diabetes. All the
analyses were done under the counterfactual framework, en-
suring a more straightforward interpretation of the results.
Further, we applied the best available outcome measurement,
linking to nationwide registries to allow for a nearly complete
follow-up and to minimise misclassification of other diseases.
Our large sample size and long follow-up period provided
sufficient statistical power to assess total and sex-specific ef-
fects, and to conduct relevant sensitivity analyses adjusted for
different variables and case ascertainment.
In conclusion, we have shown a moderate and robust asso-
ciation between workplace bullying and violence and the de-
velopment of type 2 diabetes. Both bullying and violence or
threats of violence are common in the workplace. Research on
bullying and violence prevention policies with workplaces as
the target are warranted to determine whether these policies
could be effective means of reducing the incidence of type 2
diabetes. Further study of possible pathways, for example
through weight gain, negative emotions and the physiological
stress response, will be crucial in providing an understanding
of the causal mechanisms, as well as developing more cost-
effective interventions with surrogate outcomes.
