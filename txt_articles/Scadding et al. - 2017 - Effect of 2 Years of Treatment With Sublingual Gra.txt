IMPORTANCE Sublingual immunotherapy and subcutaneous immunotherapy are effective in
seasonal allergic rhinitis. Three years of continuous treatment with subcutaneous
immunotherapy and sublingual immunotherapy has been shown to improve symptoms for at
least 2 years following discontinuation of treatment.
OBJECTIVE To assess whether 2 years of treatment with grass pollen sublingual immunotherapy,
comparedwithplacebo,providesimprovednasalresponsetoallergenchallengeat3-yearfollow-up.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled,
3–parallel-group study performed in a single academic center, Imperial College London, of
adult patients with moderate to severe seasonal allergic rhinitis (interfering with usual daily
activities or sleep). First enrollment was March 2011, last follow-up was February 2015.
INTERVENTIONS Thirty-six participants received 2 years of sublingual immunotherapy (daily
tablets containing 15 μg of major allergen Phleum p 5 and monthly placebo injections), 36
received subcutaneous immunotherapy (monthly injections containing 20 μg of Phleum p 5
and daily placebo tablets) and 34 received matched double-placebo. Nasal allergen challenge
was performed before treatment, at 1 and 2 years of treatment, and at 3 years (1 year after
treatment discontinuation).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Total nasal symptom scores (TNSS; range; 0 [best] to 12
[worst]) were recorded between 0 and 10 hours after challenge. The minimum clinically
important difference for change in TNSS within an individual is 1.08. The primary outcome
was TNSS comparing sublingual immunotherapy vs placebo at year 3. Subcutaneous
immunotherapy was included as a positive control. The study was not powered to compare
sublingual immunotherapy with subcutaneous immunotherapy.
RESULTS Among 106 randomized participants (mean age, 33.5 years; 34 women [32.1%]), 92
completed the study at 3 years. In the intent-to-treat population, mean TNSS score for the
sublingual immunotherapy group was 6.36 (95% CI, 5.76 to 6.96) at pretreatment and 4.73
(95% CI, 3.97 to 5.48) at 3 years, and for the placebo group, the score was 6.06 (95% CI, 5.23
to 6.88) at pretreatment and 4.81 (95% CI, 3.97 to 5.65) at 3 years. The between-group
difference (adjusted for baseline) was −0.18 (95% CI, −1.25 to 0.90; [P = .75]).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among patients with moderate to severe seasonal allergic
rhinitis, 2 years of sublingual grass pollen immunotherapy was not significantly different from
placebo in improving the nasal response to allergen challenge at 3-year follow-up.

T
he prevalence of allergic rhinitis in the United States has
been estimated at 15% based on physician diagnosis and
at 30% based on self-reported nasal symptoms.1,2
Rhinitis has major effects on quality of life, sleep, and work
and school performance.3 Whereas antihistamines and topi-
calnasalcorticosteroidsareeffective,4communitysurveyssug-
gest that approximately 60% of patients with allergic rhinitis
do not respond adequately to these measures.1 When avoid-
ance of allergens is not feasible and patients have inadequate
response to antiallergic medications or have bothersome ad-
verse effects, allergen immunotherapy is a reasonable choice
for treatment.5 Subcutaneous immunotherapy is highly
effective.5,6 The sublingual route has emerged as an alterna-
tive treatment for seasonal allergic rhinitis.7,8 Three years of
continuous treatment with immunotherapy via either deliv-
ery method modifies the underlying course of the disease with
long-term remission of symptoms for several years after stop-
ping treatment.9-11 It is unknown whether a shorter course of
immunotherapy provides long-term benefits, while reducing
overall costs, patient inconvenience, and adverse events.
The purpose of this study was to explore whether 2 years
of immunotherapy with a grass pollen allergen sublingual tab-
let of proven efficacy induced persistent benefit 1 year after
discontinuation (clinical tolerance).
Methods
Study Design
This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled
single-center trial conducted over 4 years, March 2011-March
2015. The study was approved by the National Research
Ethics Committee. All participants provided written in-
formedconsent.Inclusioncriteriaincludedageof18to65years,
a minimum 2-year clinical history of moderate to severe
grass-pollen–inducedallergicrhinitis(causinginterferencewith
usualdailyactivitiesorsleep3),apositiveskinpricktesttograss
pollen extract (wheal diameter ≥3 mm), elevated serum-
specific immunoglobulin E (IgE ≥0.7 kU/L), and a positive na-
sal grass allergen challenge (total nasal symptom score [TNSS]
≥7 on a 12-point scale). Exclusion criteria included a history of
moderate to severe symptoms on exposure to other overlap-
ping seasonal or perennial allergens, a history of moderate to
severe or uncontrolled asthma, severe anaphylaxis due to any
cause, chronic sinusitis, other diseases of the immune sys-
tem, and current smoking (see eMethod 1.1 in Supplement 1).
At screening, we collected demographic data that
included self-reported race (according to fixed categories) as
per National Institutes of Health requirements. Eligible par-
ticipants (Figure 1) were randomized 1:1:1 to receive either
sublingual allergen tablet immunotherapy with placebo
injections, subcutaneous injection immunotherapy with pla-
cebo tablets or double-placebo tablets and injections. Subcu-
taneous immunotherapy was included as a positive control.
Treatment assignment was by use of a central automated
web-based randomization system (RhoRAND) that helped
provide remote network backup and 24-hour support
(eMethod 1.2.1 in Supplement 1). Clinical surrogate end
points were collected at baseline, 1 and 2 years on treatment,
and 3 years at 1 year after treatment discontinuation. Double-
blinding was maintained for all participants and clinical and
laboratory staff throughout the entire duration of the study
(eMethod 1.2.2 in Supplement 1). The study protocol is pro-
vided in Supplement 2.
End Points
The primary end point was the nasal response to allergen
challenge between sublingual immunotherapy and placebo
at 3-year follow-up, 1 year after discontinuation of treat-
ment.12 This was defined as the equally weighted average of
the TNSS per hour measured as the area under the curve
(AUC) during the early response (0-1 hour) and late response
(1-10 hours) after challenge (eMethod 1.3 and eMethod 1.4 in
Supplement 1).12,13 Secondary exploratory end points
included change in peak nasal inspiratory flow (PNIF) after
challenge (eMethod 1.4.1 and eMethod 1.4.2 in Supple-
ment 1), seasonal weekly visual analog scale (VAS),14 seasonal
weekly Mini Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Question-
naire (MiniRQLQ),15 end-of-season global rhinitis severity
scores (eMethod 1.6 in Supplement 1), seasonal medication
use (eMethod 1.7 in Supplement 1), and early and late skin
responses to intradermal allergen (eMethod 1.5 in Supple-
ment 1).16 Before the pollen season began, participants
received a prespecified package containing tablets (deslorata-
dine), nasal sprays (fluticasone propionate), and eyedrops
(olopatadine). Both used and unused medication was
returned to the investigators who measured the quantity of
these medications used according to the amount that was
returned. A composite rescue medication score was derived
using an algorithm for each prescribed medication and the
mean composite score in each treatment group was com-
puted and compared (eMethod 1.7 in Supplement 1). For clini-
cal outcomes in which anchor-based methods for determin-
ing the minimum clinically important difference (MCID) were
not available, a distribution-based method was used17 based
on 50% of the standard deviation of baseline values from all
randomized participants. For TNSS, the range was 0 (best) to
12 (worst) and the MCID was 1.0817 (eMethod 1.3 in Supple-
ment 1). For the change in PNIF after challenge, the observed
range was −388 to 26.7 L/min and the MCID was 33.9 L/min17
(eMethod 1.4.1 in Supplement 1). For the global evaluation of
Key Points
Question Does 2 years of grass pollen sublingual immunotherapy
reduce symptoms after nasal allergen challenge at 3-year
follow-up (1 year after discontinuation of treatment)?
Findings In this randomized clinical trial of 106 adults, 2 years of
treatment with sublingual immunotherapy, compared with
placebo, did not significantly reduce total nasal symptom scores
after challenge at 3 years.
Meaning Among patients with moderate to severe seasonal
allergic rhinitis, 2 years of sublingual grass pollen immunotherapy
was not significantly different than placebo in improving the nasal
response to allergen challenge at 3-year follow-up.

seasonal symptoms, the range was 0 to 18, and the MCID was
1.4.17 For those clinical end points for which an MCID was avail-
able from published anchor-based methods, the range values
for the Mini-RQLQ were 0 to 6 (MCID, 0.7)15 and for the sea-
sonal weekly VAS, the range was 0 to 10 cm (MCID, 1.0).14
Intervention
Freeze-dried grass pollen (Phleum pratense) sublingual tab-
lets (Grazax [ALK])10 or matched placebo sublingual tablets
were self-administered daily for 2 years. Subcutaneous alum-
adsorbed grass pollen immunotherapy (Alutard SQ grass pol-
len [ALK])18 or matched placebo subcutaneous injections were
given weekly for 15 weeks followed by monthly maintenance
injections until 2 years. For immunotherapy protocols, see
eMethod 1.8 (in Supplement 1).
Nasal and Intradermal Allergen Challenge
Nasal allergen challenge was performed before treatment, at
1-year follow-up, 2-year follow-up, and at 3-year follow-up
(1 year after treatment discontinuation). Nasal challenge was
performed12 at 9 AM using Aquagen (ALK) P pratense (Timothy
grass) extract and participants were observed for 10 hours
(eMethod1.4inSupplement1).Intradermalallergenchallenge16
was performed 1 hour after nasal challenge. The early skin re-
sponse was recorded at 15 minutes and the late response at 8
hours (eMethod 1.5 in Supplement 1).

completion for the last participant
was February 2015).
The intent-to-treat (ITT) sample was
defined as all randomized
participants. If participants dropped
out after randomization, they were
invited to complete study
assessments throughout the duration
of the trial. The modified ITT
population (those included in the
primary efficacy analysis) included all
randomized participants with an
evaluable outcome. The per-protocol
sample was defined as the ITT sample
participants who remained in the
study for at least 3 years and in whom
the primary end point was assessed.
Participants in the per-protocol
sample had to be adherent with study
medication (taking �50% of study
medication for the study duration).

Adverse Event Recording
Adverse events were classified according to the Medical Dic-
tionary for Regulatory Activities version 14.0 (MedDRA).20 In
view of the known frequent local symptoms that occur after
both subcutaneous immunotherapy and sublingual immuno-
therapy, these symptoms were recorded as adverse events
only if they were considered bothersome by participants (in-
terfering with usual daily activities or sleep) or as described
in eMethod 1.9 (in Supplement 1). Observed immediate sys-
temic allergic reactions to immunotherapy injections (active
or placebo) were recorded by study clinicians according to
the World Allergy Organization (WAO) grading system for
subcutaneous immunotherapy (eMethod 1.9.2 in Supple-
ment 1).21 The same system was applied to adverse reactions
in response to sublingual immunotherapy (active or placebo)
reported by participants at routine clinic visits. Observed
responses to the first sublingual tablet taken were recorded
by study clinicians.22
Statistical Analysis
The intent-to-treat (ITT) population included all randomized
participants. The modified ITT population included all ran-
domized participants with an evaluable end point. The per-
protocol population included participants who were adher-
ent with study medications (defined as taking ≥50% of study
medication for the duration of the study), and who had an
evaluable primary end point (eMethod 1.10 in Supplement 1).
The primary analysis compared nasal challenge–induced
TNSS AUC in sublingual immunotherapy to placebo at 3
years using an analysis of covariance model adjusted for
baseline values. Participants in the ITT population with a
missing primary end point had their data imputed using
a regression model based on those participants within their
randomized treatment group who had available TNSS
AUC values (eMethod 1.3 in Supplement 1). Subcutaneous
immunotherapy vs placebo was analyzed as a positive con-
trol. Subcutaneous immunotherapy vs sublingual immuno-
therapy was a secondary exploratory analysis, but the study
was not powered on this comparison. Secondary outcomes
were assessed using analysis of covariance or nonparametric
methods where appropriate. Allergen-specific immunoglobu-
lin data were assessed in the per-protocol population using
linear mixed models adjusted for baseline. The study was
powered at 90% to detect a standardized mean difference
between sublingual immunotherapy and placebo groups of
approximately 40% with a 15% dropout rate (eMethod 1.11 in
Supplement 1). The threshold for significance was a P value
of less than .05 (2-sided). Secondary outcomes were consid-
ered exploratory and not adjusted for multiple comparisons.
Analyses were performed using JMP V11, SAS version 9.3
(SAS Institute Inc), and R version 3.2.4 (R Foundation for
Statistical Computing). Analysis of data was performed at the
end of the study with no interim analyses. The statistical
analysis plan is provided in Supplement 3. Analysis data
sets are available through the public website of the Immune
Tolerance Network.23
Results
Participant Characteristics, Progression, and Adherence
With Trial Medication
One hundred and six participants (mean age, 33.5 years; 34
women [32.1%]; 78 white [73.6%]) were enrolled and 92
(87%) completed the primary end point evaluation at 3 years
(Figure 1 and Table 1). The 3 groups were similar in age, sex,
and race. Adherence to injections was recorded by study
staff: 100% of completed participants received more than
50% of their injections, 95% received more than 75%, and
82% received more than 90% throughout the 2-year treat-
ment period. Adherence to sublingual medication was
assessed by counting returned tablets: 91.3% of completed
participants took more than 50% of study tablets (protocol
adherent), 75.0% took more than 75%, and 46.7% took more
than 90%.

Primary Outcome
At 3-year follow-up, 1 year after completing treatment, nasal
allergen–inducedTNSSinthesublingualimmunotherapygroup
did not differ from placebo. In the ITT population, the TNSS
AUC at year 3 was as follows: for sublingual immunotherapy,
4.73 (95% CI, 3.97 to 5.48); for placebo, 4.81 (95% CI, 3.97 to
5.65). The adjusted mean difference was −0.18 (95% CI, −1.25
to 0.90), equivalent to −1.7% compared with placebo (P = .75)
(Table 2). In the modified ITT population, the mean TNSS AUC
for sublingual immunotherapy was 4.55 (95% CI, 3.67 to 5.43)
andforplacebo,itwas4.82(95%CI,3.90to5.74).Thebetween-
groupdifferenceadjustedforbaselinewas−0.30(95%CI,−1.52
to 0.92), equivalent to −5.6% for sublingual immunotherapy
compared with placebo (P = .62) (Figure 2 and Table 2). Sub-
cutaneous immunotherapy (positive control for the study) had
a mean TNSS AUC of 3.96 (95% CI, 3.21 to 4.71), a difference
from placebo of −0.90 (95% CI, −1.96 to 0.16), equivalent to
−17.8% compared with placebo (P = .10). Baseline (pretreat-
ment) TNSS AUC values for all 3 groups were as follows: sub-
lingual immunotherapy, 6.36 (95% CI, 5.76 to 6.96); placebo,
6.06 (95% CI, 5.23 to 6.88); and for subcutaneous immuno-
therapy, 6.10 (95% CI, 5.32 to 6.89).
Secondary Exploratory Outcomes
At year 3 (1 year after discontinuation of treatment), allergen-
inducedreductionfromprechallengebaselineinPNIF(Figure2
and eTable 1 in Supplement 1), expressed as the 0- to 10-hour
AUC, did not differ from placebo with either form of immu-
notherapy. Similarly at year 3, no benefit from either form of
immunotherapy was observed in the weekly seasonal mini-
RQLQ and VAS symptom scores (Figure 3; eTable 2a and eTable
2b in Supplement 1) or in global evaluations of rhinitis sever-
ity compared with placebo. (eFigure and eTable 2c in
Supplement 1). Pollen season medication use was assessed by
count of returned packages (both used and unused). Approxi-
mately90%ofparticipantsreturnedsomemedication,whereas
complete returns were obtained from 47% to 70% of partici-
pants throughout the 3 years (eTable 3a in Supplement 1). No
significant differences in total rescue medication scores be-
tween the 3 groups were observed at year 3 after 1 year off

P values, 95% CIs, and mean differences were calculated using an analysis of
covariance model adjusted for pretreatment baseline TNSS (scale 0 [best]
to 12 [worst]) AUC at the 0.05 level of significance. The weighted 10-hour AUC
was calculated as the (early-phase response [0-1 h] /1 + late-phase response
[1-10 h] /9). Values were imputed for participants in the ITT population with
missing primary end point data (performed within treatment group using
participants who had available TNSS AUC values). Specifically, a linear
regression line and 95% CIs were fit where year 3 values were regressed on
TNSS AUC values at time t (t = baseline, year 1, or year 2). Within each
treatment group, a missing year 3 TNSS AUC value was imputed as the value
predicted from the linear regression line. The primary end point was also
calculated in the modified ITT population.

therapy (eTable 3b in Supplement 1). In contrast, both sublin-
gualandsubcutaneousimmunotherapygroupshadlowerearly
skin response and lower late skin response to allergen than pla-
cebo at year 3 after 1 year off therapy (Figure 4; eTable 4a and
eTable 4b in Supplement 1). Serum allergen–specific IgE did
not differ between sublingual immunotherapy and placebo at
year 3 but was significantly lower in the subcutaneous immu-
notherapy group than the other 2 groups (Figure 4 and eTable
5a in Supplement 1). Allergen-specific IgG4 in serum was sig-
nificantly higher with both forms of immunotherapy com-
pared with placebo at year 3 (Figure 4 and eTable 5b in
Supplement 1).
At the end of the first year of treatment, subcutaneous
immunotherapy, but not sublingual immunotherapy,
improved TNSS AUC when compared with placebo. At the
end of the second year, both forms of immunotherapy per-
formed better than placebo (Figure 2 and Table 2). For the
seasonal mini RQLQ and global severity evaluations, both
forms of immunotherapy showed improvement over placebo
after the first and second years of treatment (Figure 3; eFig-
ure, eTable 2a, and eTable 2c in Supplement 1). Results for
other secondary exploratory outcomes at years 1 and 2 of
treatment can be summarized as follows: sublingual immu-
notherapy but not subcutaneous immunotherapy was associ-
ated with decreased use of seasonal rescue medications
(eTable 3b in Supplement 1); both sublingual immunotherapy
and subcutaneous immunotherapy resulted in decreased
early (15-minute) and late (8-hour) skin responses to intrader-
mal allergen challenge at 1 and 2 years (Figure 4; eTable 4a
and eTable 4b in Supplement 1); for allergen-specific IgE,
sublingual immunotherapy resulted in increased values over
placebo whereas subcutaneous immunotherapy had the
opposite effect (Figure 4 and eTable 5a in Supplement 1); and
for IgG4, both forms of treatment resulted in increases over
placebo (Figure 4 and eTable 5b in Supplement 1).
Adverse Events
A total of 553 adverse events were recorded, of which 116 were
related to study participation. All adverse events are shown in
eTable 8 in Supplement 1. No serious treatment-related ad-
verse events were recorded. Adverse events were higher in the
subcutaneousimmunotherapygroup.Adverseeventswithsig-
nificant differences between groups are shown in Table 3.

Data are reported as mean values for all participants. Total Nasal Symptom
Scores (TNSS) and peak nasal inspiratory flow (PNIF) were analyzed in the
modified intent-to-treat population of 34 sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT)
participants, 33 placebo participants, and 33 subcutaneous immunotherapy
(SCIT) participants at year 1; 31 SLIT participants, 32 placebo participants, and 32
SCIT participants at year 2; and 30 SLIT participants, 31 placebo participants,
and 31 SCIT participants at year 3. A, A higher TNSS indicates a higher burden of
symptoms during the nasal challenge (range, 0 [best] to 12 [worst]). Mean
scores for the TNSS are reported in Table 2. The P values compare the TNSS area
under the curve (AUC) between treatment groups (calculated using an analysis
of covariance [ANCOVA] model at at the 0.05 level of significance adjusted for
pretreatment baseline AUC measures [minimal clinically important difference
for this measure within a participant was 1.08]).17 B, A larger change in PNIF
indicates a higher burden of symptoms during the nasal challenge. Change
(liters/min) was defined relative to the 0 time point in the challenge. Mean
values for the change in PNIF are reported in eTable 1 (in Supplement 1).
The P values compare the delta PNIF AUC between treatment groups
(calculated using an ANCOVA model at the 0.05 level of significance adjusted
for pretreatment baseline AUC measures [minimal clinically important
difference for this measure within a participant was 33.9]).17

Data are mean weekly values for all participants. The curves were smoothed
using a cubic spline smoothing function (using a set of third-degree polynomials
spliced together such that the resulting curve is continuous and smooth at the
splices [knot points]). The estimation was calculated by minimizing an objective
function (a combination of the sum of squares error and a penalty for curvature
integrated over the curve extent).24 The P values compare the mean values
between treatment groups and were calculated using an analysis of covariance
model at the 0.05 level of significance adjusted for pretreatment baseline
measures. The Mini-Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire
(Mini-RQLQ) and a visual analog scale (VAS) were analyzed in the modified
intent-to-treat population of 33 sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) participants,
33 placebo participants, and 34 subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT)
participants at year 1; 28 SLIT participants, 31 placebo participants, and 30 SCIT
participants at year 2; 27 SLIT participants, 30 placebo participants, and 29 SCIT
participants at year 3. A, Mini-RQLQ values range from 0 to 6 (higher values
indicate participants with more troublesome nose, eye, and other symptoms
affecting regular activities resulting in a lower quality of life). The minimal
clinically important difference for this measure within a participant is 0.7
(eTable 2a in Supplement 1).15 B, VAS values range from 0 to 10 cm (higher
values indicate participants with worse hay fever symptoms). The minimal
clinically important difference for this measure within a participant is 1.0 cm
(eTable 2b in Supplement 1).14 C, Mean weekly grass pollen counts per cubic
meter from a single site in Islington, London were provided by the Met Office
(UK national weather service).

indigestion), were short lived and were either not treated
or self-treated with antacids or antihistamines. No partici-
pant in the sublingual immunotherapy group withdrew due
to adverse events.
Events occurring in the first hour following administra-
tion of the first sublingual tablet (active or placebo) under
supervision were also recorded (eTable 6 in Supplement 1);
none of the 106 participants had a systemic allergic reaction
and 11 of the 106 (10 in the active sublingual group and 1 in
the subcutaneous immunotherapy group) reported a mild

Systemic allergic reactions after subcutaneous immuno-
therapy were graded according to the World Allergy Organi-
zation classification (eTable 7a in Supplement 1).21 A total of
41 systemic reactions after active injections occurred in 19 par-
ticipants. The majority were mild: 31 grade 1 of which 8 were
early (0-60 minutes), 19 were delayed (after 1 hour), and in 4,
the timing was undefined; 8 were grade 2 (2 early, 6 delayed);
and 2 were grade 3 (1 early, 1 delayed [at 2 hours]). In partici-
pants with grades 1 and 2 reactions, symptoms resolved with
no treatment or with oral antihistamines. In grade 3 reac-
tions, adrenaline was used with prompt response. The same
classification was used for participant-reported systemic

Data are once-yearly mean values for all participants. Early skin response was
recorded at 15 minutes and late skin response was recorded at 8 hours. Skin
responses were analyzed using analysis of covariance with adjustment for
baseline values in the modified intent-to-treat population of 33 sublingual
immunotherapy (SLIT) participants, 33 placebo participants, and 34
subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT) participants at year 1; 31 SLIT participants,
32 placebo participants, and 32 SCIT participants at year 2; 30 SLIT participants,
31 placebo participants, and 31 SCIT participants at year 3 (eTable 4a and eTable
4b in Supplement 1). Serum allergen–specific immunoglobulin parameters were
analyzed in the per-protocol population of 27 SLIT, 30 placebo, and 27 SCIT
participants at all time points using a linear mixed model with adjustment for
baseline values. Serum allergen–specific immunoglobulin responses were
plotted after log transformation for normalization of these variables. The
per-protocol sample included participants who were adherent with study
medications (taking �50% of study medication for study duration) and who
had an assessment of the primary end point. All comparisons for skin and serum
allergen–specific immunoglobulin responses between treatment groups at
years 1, 2, and 3 have P values less than .01, with the following exceptions: early
skin responses between SLIT and SCIT at year 2 (P = .02) and year 3 (P = .94),
specific immunoglobulin E between SLIT and placebo at year 2 (P = .04) and
year 3 (P = .32), and between SCIT and placebo at year 1 (P = .10) (eTable 5a and

reactions after administration of sublingual immunotherapy
tablets (eTable 7b in Supplement 1). Of 18 reported reactions,
16 were grade 1, and 2 were grade 2. Although these events
strictly fulfilled criteria for World Allergy Organization sys-
temic reactions, they all consisted of local or upper gastroin-
testinal symptoms. All were transient and mild and none re-
quired adrenaline or resulted in participant withdrawals.
Discussion
This study, by use of nasal allergen challenge, demonstrated
that in patients with moderate to severe seasonal allergic rhi-
nitis, treatment for 2 years with grass pollen sublingual
immunotherapy was not sufficient to achieve an allergic
response improvement at 3-year follow-up. Previous ran-
domized placebo-controlled trials demonstrated that 3 years
of continuous therapy with either sublingual immuno-
therapy or subcutaneous immunotherapy resulted in long-
term clinical efficacy with decreases in seasonal symptoms
and use of antiallergic medications that persisted for at least
2 years after discontinuation9-11 (3 years for subcutaneous
immunotherapy11). Subcutaneous immunotherapy has been
used for more than 100 years,6,25 but in recent years, the
sublingual route has been shown to be an effective and safer
alternative.7 International guidelines regarding immuno-
therapy recommend a minimum of 3 years of treatment7,26
with both delivery methods. If a 2-year regimen had demon-
strated long-term benefits in addition to efficacy, this could
have represented cost savings in terms of clinical resources
and improved convenience for the patient. Because this was
not observed, clinicians should be advised to follow estab-
lished guidelines that recommend at least 3 years treatment.
The World Allergy Organization has recommended (em-
pirically) a 20% difference from placebo as the minimum
clinically meaningful difference for seasonal outcomes in
immunotherapy trials.27 Previous randomized clinical trials
of both the sublingual and subcutaneous allergen immuno-
therapies used in the current trial demonstrated a 30% differ-
ence from placebo in seasonal symptoms.6,18 In a previous
cross-sectional study, a 45% reduction in TNSS and 54%
improvement in PNIF following allergen challenge was
shown in grass pollen immunotherapy–treated patients com-
pared with untreated patients with seasonal rhinitis.13 There-
fore, this trial was powered to detect a difference of 40%
between either form of immunotherapy and placebo. There
was no significant decrease in the primary outcome of TNSS
at 1 year following withdrawal of treatment (5.6% for sublin-
gual immunotherapy compared with placebo and 17.8% for
subcutaneous immunotherapy). Nonetheless, in secondary
exploratory outcomes, both treatments were superior to pla-
cebo as shown by significant reductions for sublingual immu-
notherapy (27.0%) and subcutaneous immunotherapy
(41.6%) at 2 years (Table 2).
There are limitations to this study. First, daily symptom
diary records were not used during the grass pollen season.
However, nasal allergen challenge was used as a surrogate12
for seasonal outcomes, thereby allowing reproducible expo-
sure to grass pollen allergen in a controlled environment while
avoiding the high season-to-season variability to natural pol-
len exposure. A previous study showed a significant correla-
tion between TNSS and reductions in PNIF after challenge and
seasonal symptoms.13 Second, the study was not designed to
compare 2 vs 3 years sublingual immunotherapy, and there-
fore, this study cannot determine whether 3 years of therapy
would have been sufficient to produce long-term benefits.
Given that previous studies have consistently shown long-
term benefits when therapy is discontinued after 3 years,9-11,28
this trial was designed to address the question whether 2 years
of treatment were adequate. For sublingual immunotherapy,

a AEs were reported by observing the participant, questioning the participant in
an objective manner, or receiving an unsolicited complaint from the
participant. Any reactions occurring in the clinic due to procedures,
administration of subcutaneous immunotherapy, or the first administration of
sublingual immunotherapy were recorded on related CRFs and entered into
the electronic database. Reactions occurring outside the clinic to either
subcutaneous or sublingual immunotherapy or other AEs were assessed by
study staff at clinic visits and recorded on related CRFs and entered into the
electronic database. Adverse events for this trial have been coded according
to international Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities classification. Only
system organ classes and preferred terms with a significant P value are
reported. P values for participant-level analyses (percentages) were computed
using Fisher Exact Tests. P values for event-level analyses (total number of
events) were computed using a Poisson regression model comparing the
person-year adjusted event rates between each treatment group.
Hypersensitivity indicates systemic reactions after subcutaneous
immunotherapy, which included mostly mild reactions such as itchy eyes or
nose, blocked nose, runny nose, sneezing, itchiness or rash; 2 events with
shortness of breath, and sensation of throat closure resulted in administration
of epinephrine. There were no serious treatment-related AEs.

47% of participants took more than 90% of doses over the
2-year period compared with 82% for subcutaneous immu-
notherapy. In addition, although both treatments were ad-
ministered using double-blind methods with both sublingual
and subcutaneous placebos, it is possible that the occurrence
oflocalreactionsinaproportionofparticipantsafterbothforms
of immunotherapy may have compromised blinding. For this
reason, all nasal challenges and skin tests were performed by
1 individual (G.W.S.) who was not involved in the clinical im-
munotherapy protocol or in seasonal assessments.
Secondary exploratory seasonal outcomes were in ac-
cord with the observed lack of effect of both treatment mo-
dalities on nasal challenge at 3 years. Seasonal outcomes and
response to nasal challenge were also consistent in showing
improvement while on treatment at years 1 and 2 (Figure 2 and
Figure 3; eTable 1, eTable 2a, eTable 2b, and eTable 2c in
Supplement 1). The comparative efficacy of the 2 routes of im-
munotherapy is unknown. Previous systematic reviews have
relied on indirect comparisons29-31 with few head-to-head ran-
domized trials of natural allergen exposure.32
This study was not powered to detect differences
between active treatments. However, at year 1, subcutaneous
immunotherapy was more effective than sublingual immu-
notherapy in reducing TNSS after challenge; conversely, the
use of seasonal rescue medication was lower for sublingual
immunotherapy compared with subcutaneous immuno-
therapy. These data highlight the need for a head-to-head
clinical trial of sublingual and subcutaneous immunotherapy
during natural pollen exposure using seasonal outcomes.
Sublingual immunotherapy was associated with a transient
increase in allergen-specific IgE at year 1, whereas after sub-
cutaneous immunotherapy, specific IgE levels were un-
changed at year 1 and decreased during years 2 and 3 when
compared with placebo. These findings are in agreement
with previous studies although the mechanisms are
unknown.10,33 Changes in serum allergen–specific IgG416,34
paralleled suppression of allergen-induced early and late skin
responses. These immunologic changes, although reduced,
persisted at year 3 (Figure 4). Together with the accompany-
ing suppression of early and late skin responses, these effects
could be regarded as early indicators of effective clinical tol-
erance, which has previously been convincingly documented
following 3 years immunotherapy via both routes.9-11
Almost all adverse reactions to sublingual immuno-
therapy were isolated, mild, transient, local oral or upper gas-
trointestinal symptoms (eTable 7b in Supplement 1). None of
these reactions required acute medical intervention or
resulted in withdrawal from the trial. Although these adverse
reactions were recorded as systemic according to the World
Allergy Organization grading for subcutaneous immuno-
therapy (eMethods 1.9.2. in Supplement 1),21 this may not be
appropriate given the proximity of the symptoms to the site
of sublingual immunotherapy administration. These results
are consistent with the safe self-administration of sublingual
immunotherapy as reported in systematic reviews8,30 and
large controlled trials.35,36 Subcutaneous immunotherapy
was associated with expected systemic reactions21 including
2 grade 3 reactions requiring adrenaline. This emphasizes the
need for close observation in a specialist setting for subcuta-
neous immunotherapy (eTable 7a in Supplement 1).
Conclusions
Among patients with moderate to severe seasonal allergic

Funding/Support: The trial was conducted by the
ITN with financial support from the DAIT-NIAID,
National Institutes of Health (NIH) under award
numbers NO1-AI-15416, UM1AI109565, and
UM2AI117870; the following DAIT-NIAID–funded
groups: Statistical and Clinical Coordinating
Centers (contract HHSN272200800029C and
grant UM2AI117870), Clinical Site Monitoring
Center (contract HHSN272201200004C),
and Regulatory Management Center (contract
HHSN272201200002C); ALK-Abello A/S Horsholm,
Denmark supplied Alutard SQ Grass Pollen, and
Grazax, and matching placebos used for the GRASS
clinical trial to DAIT-NIAID without charge.
Dr Durham served as the sponsor of the Medicines
and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency Clinical
Trial Application.
Role of the Funder/Sponsor: The sponsor for the
study was the ITN under a contract from the NIAID.
The ITN clinical trial physician and administrative
team and ITN scientists liaised closely concerning all
aspects of the trial with the principal investigator
(protocol chair) and the site team at Imperial
College London. Similarly, the medical monitor from
NIAID and the regulatory team at NIAID worked
closely with ITN and the protocol chair and study
team concerning all aspects of the study. ALK
Denmark supplied the allergy vaccines, matched
placebos, and allergen extracts for skin testing and
nasal allergen provocation for the study free of
charge. ALK had no input to the design and conduct
of the study; collection, management, analysis, and
interpretation of the data; preparation, review, or
approval of the manuscript or decision to submit
the manuscript for publication.
