Abstract 
Telomerase activation protects cells from telomere 
damage by delaying senescence and inducing cell 
immortalization, whereas telomerase inhibition 
mediates rapid senescence or apoptosis. However, 
the cellular mechanisms that determine telomere 
damage–dependent senescence versus apoptosis 
induction 
are 
largely 
unknown. 
Here, 
we 
demonstrate that telomerase instability mediated 
by silencing of sphingosine kinase 2 (SPHK2) and 
sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), which binds and 
stabilizes telomerase, induces telomere damage– 
dependent caspase-3 activation and apoptosis, but 
not senescence, in p16-deficient lung cancer cells 
or tumors. These outcomes were prevented by 
knockdown 
of 
a 
tumor-suppressor 
protein, 
transcription factor 21 (TCF21), or by ectopic 
expression of WT human telomerase reverse 
transcriptase (hTERT), but not mutant hTERT 
with altered S1P binding. Interestingly, SphK2- 
deficient mice exhibited accelerated aging and 
telomerase instability that increased telomere 
damage and senescence via p16 activation 
especially in testes tissues, but not in apoptosis. 
Moreover, p16 silencing in SphK2-/- mouse 
embryonic fibroblasts activated caspase-3 and 
apoptosis without inducing senescence. Further, 
ectopic WT p16 expression in p16-deficient A549 
lung cancer cells prevented TCF21 and caspase-3 
activation, and resulted in senescence in response 
to SphK2/S1P inhibition and telomere damage. 
Mechanistically, a p16 mutant with impaired 
caspase-3 association did not prevent telomere 
damage–induced apoptosis, indicating that an 
association 
between 
p16 
and 
caspase-3 
proteinsforces senescence induction by inhibiting 
caspase- 3 activation and apoptosis. These results 
suggest that p16 plays a direct role in telomere 
damage–dependent 
senescence 
by 
limiting 
apoptosis via binding to caspase-3, revealing a 
direct link between telomere damage–dependent 
senescence and apoptosis with regards to aging 
and cancer. 
 
Introduction 
Telomerase is composed of a catalytic reverse 
transcriptase (TERT) and telomeric template RNA 
(TR), which plays a key role in the elongation and 
maintenance of telomeres at chromosome ends (1-
4). Shelterin complex proteins associate with 
telomere repeats for protection from inducing 
DNA damage response to overcome replicative 
end protection problem (5-8). Telomerase is highy 
expressed in stem cells, while it is inactivated due 
to 
epigenetic 
silencing 
of 
TERT 
upon 
differentiation in most somatic cell types (9,10). 
However, telomerase is reactivated in majority of 
cancer cells, inducing cell immortalization and 
tumorigenesis (11-14). Recent studies revealed a 
clinical relevance of TERT activation in cancer, as 
mutations within the core promoter region of the 
TERT gene provide binding sites for E-twenty-six 
(ETS) transcription factors, leading to cancer-
specific telomerase reactivation (15-17).

aging 
process 
(18,19), 
whereas 
targeting 
telomerase induces tumor suppressor responses 
such as senescence or apoptosis (20,21). However, 
signaling mechanisms that distinctly induce 
senescence versus apoptosis in non-cancerous 
versus cancerous cells in response to telomerase 
inactivation and telomere damage induction are 
largely unknown.  
 
Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) is a 
bioactive sphingolipid, generated by sphingosine 
kinase 1 or 2 (SPHK1 or SPHK2), that exerts pro-
oncogenic signaling via engaging with its G-
protein coupled receptors (S1PR1-5) in an 
autocrine or paracrine manner, and/or via directly 
binding to regulate its intracellular target proteins 
without receptor signaling (22-25). Intracellular 
targets of SPHK2-generated nuclear S1P include 
HDAC1/2 (26) and TERT (27). Our previous 
study described a role for SPHK2-generated S1P 
in the stabilization of telomerase via directly 
binding to hTERT involving its D684 residue (27). 
These studies also suggested that S1P binding 
mimicked the phosphorylation of hTERT at Ser921, 
which protected hTERT from ubiquitination and 
proteasomal degradation (27). However, roles and 
mechanisms by which targeting SPHK2/S1P and 
TERT induces senescence versus apoptosis with 
respect to telomere damage signaling and tumor 
suppression are largely unknown. Thus, in this 
study, we have outlined experiments to uncover 
signaling mechanisms that determine responses for 
the induction of senescence versus apoptosis via 
telomere damage-mediated cellular stress.  
 
Results 
Inhibition of SPHK2/S1P attenuates hTERT 
abundance and tumor growth  
To determine the roles of SPHK2/S1P in 
the regulation of tumor suppression via controlling 
telomerase and telomere damage, we measured the 
effects 
of 
silencing 
and/or 
pharmacologic 
inhibition of SPHK2/S1P signaling using shRNA-
dependent knockdown or small molecule inhibitor 
of SPHK2, ABC294640 (28-30) (Supplemental 
Fig. S1A) on the growth of A549 xenograft-
derived tumors in SCID mice. ShRNA-mediated 
knockdown of SPHK2 (~75% mRNA reduction 
compared 
to 
Scr-shRNA-expressing 
tumors, 
measured by qPCR) almost completely prevented 
A549-xenograft-tumor growth compared to Scr-
shRNA/A549-xenograft controls after 21 days 
(Fig. 1A-B). Similarly, inhibition of SPHK2 using 
ABC294640 (100 mg/kg, 7 days/week treatment 
for 21 days) suppressed A549-xenograft-tumor 
growth compared to vehicle-treated controls (Fig. 
1A). Interestingly, ABC294640 treatment had no 
additional effect on A549-xenograft-tumor growth 
suppression in response to shRNA-mediated 
SPHK2 knockdown, supporting its role in SPHK2 
inhibition for tumor suppression (Fig. 1A). 
Suppression of A549-xenograft-tumor growth in 
response to SPHK2 knockdown or inhibition was 
consistent 
with 
decreased 
hTERT 
protein 
abundance and apoptosis measured by IHC using 
anti-hTERT 
antibody 
and 
TUNEL 
assay, 
respectively, compared to control tumor tissues 
(Fig. 1C-D). In addition, SPHK2 inhibition or 
knockdown resulted in increased telomere damage 
in A549-xenograft-tumors compared to controls, 
measured ex vivo by immunofluorescence using 
anti-TRF2 and anti-g-H2AX antibodies in TIF 
(telomere damage-induced foci) assay (31) (Fig. 
1E). Moreover, there was no significant difference 
in the staining of senescence associated-beta 
galactosidase in shSPHK2 tumors compared to 
shScr controls (Fig. 1F). Similar data were also 
obtained when A549-luciferase derived tumors 
were grown orthotopically in the lungs of SCID 
mice after tail vein injection, and inhibition of 
SPHK2 using ABC294640 decreased lung tumor 
growth (~95%) and hTERT abundance compared 
to vehicle-treated controls (Supplemental Fig. 
S1B-D).  
To assess the clinical relevance of hTERT 
regulation by SPHK2/S1P signaling, we then 
determined SPHK2 abundance with regard to 
hTERT expression by IHC using commercially 
available tumor microarrays (TMAs) containing 
lung tumor tissues obtained from patients with 
NSCLC (n=48) and their adjacent pathologically 
non-cancerous lung tissues (n=48). The data 
showed that SPHK2 is significantly over-
expressed (~2.5-fold) in the majority of NSCLC 
tumors compared to their controls (46/48 tumors, 
p<0.05) (Supplemental Fig. S2A-B). The data also 
showed that hTERT was up-regulated (~2.8-fold) 
in the majority of NSCLC tumors (47/48, p<0.05) 
(Supplemental 
Fig. 
S2B). 
Importantly, 
the 
Spearman correlation analysis showed that there is 
a significant (n=48, p<0.001) association between 
SPHK2 and hTERT expression in these tissues 
(Supplemental Fig. S2C). Similar correlation

between SPHK2 and hTERT was detected in the 
majority of tumor tissues obtained from patients 
with small cell lung cancer (SCLC) (Supplemental 
Fig. S2D). Thus, these data suggest that targeting 
clinically relevant and upregulated SPHK2/S1P in 
tumors inhibits hTERT abundance, which is 
associated with increased telomere damage and 
apoptosis, leading to tumor growth suppression in 
vivo.  
 
Targeting 
SPHK2/S1P 
signaling 
mediates 
telomere damage and subsequent caspase 3 
activation in lung cancer and/or immortalized 
MEFs 
Because SPHK2 silencing or inhibition 
induced apoptosis (increased TUNEL staining) in 
ABC294640-derived lung tumor xenografts in 
SCID mice (Fig. 1D), we then measured the 
effects of ABC294640 on caspase activation using 
MEFs obtained from  caspase3/caspase7 knockout 
mice (32), containing their various combinations 
of homozygous or heterozygous  deletions. 
Treatment of caspase3+/-/caspase7+/- MEFs with 
ABC294640 (80 µM, 8 h) increased caspase 3/7 
activity ~2-fold compared to vehicle treated 
controls (Fig. 2A). Deletion of caspase 3 alone or 
in combination with caspase 7 completely 
abolished caspase activation in response to 
ABC294640 in caspase3-/-/caspase7+/- or caspase3-
/-/caspase7-/- MEFs compared to controls (Fig. 2A). 
Interestingly, deletion of caspase 7 in caspase3+/-
/caspase7-/- MEFs increased basal levels of caspase 
3 activity compared to vehicle-treated caspase3+/-
/caspase7+/- control MEFs, and ABC294640 was 
able to further induce caspase activity in 
caspase3+/-/caspase7-/- MEFs compared to their 
vehicle-treated controls. Moreover, ABC294640 
increased telomere damage in a similar manner in 
caspase3+/-/caspase7+/- and caspase3-/-/caspase7+/- 
MEFs (Fig. 2B), suggesting that caspase 3 
activation is regulated downstream of telomere 
damage in response to SPHK2 inhibition. These 
data were also consistent in A549 cells, in which 
ABC294640 induced caspase 3 activity ~1.8-fold 
compared 
to 
vehicle-treated 
controls, 
and 
inhibition of caspase 3 using Z-DEVD (33) 
pretreatment completely abrogated ABC294640-
mediated caspase 3 activation (Fig. 2C). In 
reconstitution experiments in A549 cells stably 
expressing Scr or SPHK2 shRNAs, while ectopic 
expression of WT-SPHK2 protected caspase 3 
activation in response to ABC294640, catalytically 
inactive mutant SPHK2G212E  expression (34) was 
not protective compared to controls (Fig. 2D-E). 
Exogenous addition of S1P (5µM, 1h) also 
prevented 
ABC294640-mediated 
caspase 
3 
activation in A549 cells compared to vehicle-
treated controls (Fig. 2F).  
Increased telomere damage in response to 
genetic loss of SphK2 was also detected in SphK2-
/- compared to WT-MEFs (Fig. 3A). Moreover, 
shRNA-mediated SPHK2 knockdown resulted in 
telomere damage in A549 cells compared to Scr-
shRNA-transfected controls (Fig. 3B). As a 
control, we also detected the effects of hTERT 
knockdown on telomere damage in A549 cells in 
the absence/presence of ABC294640. ShRNA-
mediated 
hTERT 
knockdown 
and 
SPHK2 
inhibition using ABC294640 induced telomere 
damage at a similar level (~2.5-fold) compared to 
controls (Fig. 3C). However, inhibition of SPHK2 
had no additional effect on telomere damage in 
response to hTERT knockdown (Fig. 3C). 
Moreover, 
shRNA-mediated 
knockdown 
of 
SphK2 or its pharmacologic inhibition using 
ABC294640 resulted in telomere damage and 
subsequent caspase 3 activation in A549 cells in 
response to G0/G1 arrest during serum starvation 
(Supplemental Fig. S3A-B and S3C-D). In 
addition, shRNA-mediated knockdown of SphK2 
(Supplemental Fig. S4A) decreased S1P and 
dihydro-S1P without causing large changes in 
C16-ceramide or dihydro-C16-ceramide compared 
to Scr-shRNA-transfected cells (Supplemental Fig. 
S4B). These data suggest that telomere damage 
and/or caspase 3 activation in response to 
SphK2/S1P knockdown is regulated independently 
of cell cycle status and/or changes in ceramide and 
dihydro-ceramide accumulation in A549 cells.  
However, 
SphK2 
inhibition 
using 
ABC294640 mediated telomere damage without 
detectable caspase 3 activation in primary non 
cancereous human lung fibroblasts (generation 2, 
Supplemental Fig. S5), suggesting that caspase 3 
activation downstream of telomere damage might 
be regulated differentially in A549 lung cancer 
versus 
non-cancereous 
lung 
fibroblasts. 
Interestingly, inhibition of SPHK2/S1P signaling 
using ABC294640 had no effect on p53-induced 
DNA damage as measured by co-localization of 
p53 and g-H2AX using immunofluorescence in 
A549 cells (Fig. 3D). Cisplatin exposure was used

as a positive control for p53-mediated DNA 
damage, which increased the co-localization of 
p53 and g-H2AX in A549 cells compared to 
vehicle-treated controls (Fig. 3D). These data 
suggest that targeting SphK2/S1P signaling results 
in caspase 3 activation due to selective telomere 
damage, and not due to the activation of general 
DNA damage response.   
 
SphK2/S1P inhibition leads to telomere damage 
through attenuation of S1P-hTERT association 
and phosphomimicking of telomerase 
To determine the involvement of hTERT in the 
regulation of telomere damage and subsequent 
caspase 3 activation, we performed studies in 
GM847 cells, which do not express endogenous 
TERT, but contain telomeric template RNA (27). 
In GM847 cells, ABC294640 increased caspase 3 
activity ~3-fold compared to controls, and ectopic 
expression 
of 
WT-hTERT 
abrogated 
this 
ABC294640-mediated caspase activation (Fig. 
4A-B). However, ectopic expression of a mutant 
hTERT with D684A conversion, with decreased 
S1P binding, was not protective for caspase 3 
activation in response to ABC294640 (Fig. 4A-B). 
Moreover, expression of the phospho-mimic 
mutant 
of 
hTERT 
(S921D) 
with 
D684A 
conversion, 
which 
does 
not 
bind 
S1P 
(Supplemental Fig. S3C), was able to protect 
ABC294640-mediated caspase activation (Fig. 
4A-B). Expression of WT- and mutant hTERT 
proteins was confirmed using Western blotting 
(Fig. 4D).   
These data were also consistent with the 
effects of ectopic expression of WT-hTERT, but 
not D684A-hTERT with altered S1P binding, on 
the protection of telomere damage in response to 
SPHK2/S1P 
targeting 
using 
ABC294640 
compared to vector-transfected controls (Fig. 5A-
B). However, phospho-mimic mutant of hTERT 
restored 
telomere 
damage 
in 
response 
to 
ABC294640 even in the absence of S1P binding 
due to D684A conversion in cells that express 
D684A/S921D double mutation compared to 
controls, expressing S921A or S921D single 
mutations, which still bind S1P and protected 
telomere damage (Fig. 5A-B).  Similarly, while 
ectopic expression of WT-hTERT prevented 
ABC294640-mediated cell death, measured by 
trypan blue exclusion assay, inhibition of S1P-
hTERT binding by D684A mutation restored cell 
death in response to ABC294640 compared to 
controls (Fig. 5C). However, phosphomimic 
S921D/D684A-hTERT mutant expression also 
prevented ABC294640-mediated cell death (Fig. 
5C). Thus, these data suggest that S1P-binding to 
hTERT involving D684 protects telomere damage 
and 
caspase 
activation 
by 
mimicking 
phosphorylation of hTERT at Ser921. These data 
also suggest that targeting SPHK2/S1P signaling 
by ABC29640 induces telomere damage due to 
attenuation of S1P-hTERT association, leading to 
inhibition of phosphomimicking of hTERT, 
hTERT instability, and subsequent caspase 3 
activation.  
 
Activation 
of 
tumor 
suppressor 
TCF21 
mediates telomere damage and caspase 3 
activation in response to SphK2/S1P targeting 
To 
determine 
the 
signaling 
between 
SPHK2/S1P/hTERT targeting and caspase 3 
activation, we measured the effects of SPHK2 
knockdown on the expression of genes involved in 
lung tumor growth/suppression by q-PCR-based 
lung cancer specific RT2 profiler PCR array (35) 
using total mRNA isolated from A549-xenograft-
derived 
tumors 
expressing 
SPHK2 
shRNA 
compared 
to 
Scr-shRNA 
expressing 
tumor 
controls (shown in Fig. 1A). The data showed that 
down-regulation of SPHK2 induced the expression 
of 
GPM6A, 
CA4, 
CDH13, 
TCF21, 
CDKN2A/OPCML and ERBB2 (~21-3-fold), 
while decreasing the expression of CXCL13, 
MMP9 and CLCA2 (~4-8-fold) compared to 
controls (Supplemental Fig. S6A). Among these, 
we were able to validate increased expression of 
tumor suppressor TCF21 (36) (~5-fold) in 
response to SPHK2 knockdown in A549 cells 
(Supplemental Fig. S6B). Moreover, shRNA-
mediated knockdown of hTERT also induced 
TCF21 mRNA expression (~3.5-fold) compared to 
Scr-shRNA-expressing 
controls 
(Supplemental 
Fig. S6C). Ectopic expression of WT-hTERT, but 
not D684A-hTERT, prevented TCF21 mRNA 
induction in response to SPHK2 knockdown 
(Supplemental Fig. S6D). In addition, targeting 
SPHK2/S1P using ABC294640 induced TCF21 
mRNA (~10-fold) and resulted in caspase 3 
activation (~8-fold) compared to vehicle treated 
controls (Supplemental Fig. S4E-F). ShRNA-
mediated knockdown of TCF21 (Supplemental 
Fig. S6E) prevented caspase 3 activation in

response 
to 
ABC294640 
in 
A549 
cells 
(Supplemental Fig. S6F).  
 
To determine the effects of TCF21 
activation in the regulation of lung tumor 
suppression in response to SPHK2/S1P/hTERT 
targeting in vivo, we measured the growth of 
A549-derived xenografts expressing Scr- or 
TCF21-shRNAs in the absence/presence of 
ABC294640. Treatment with ABC294640 (100 
mg/kg at every 7 days for 21 days) inhibited the 
growth 
of 
Scr-shRNA 
expressing 
tumors 
compared to vehicle treated controls (Fig. 6A). 
ShRNA-mediated knockdown of TCF21 prevented 
ABC29464-mediated tumor suppression compared 
to controls (Fig. 6A). After growth measurements, 
remaining tumors were extracted from these mice, 
and effects of ABC294640 in the presence/absence 
of TCF21 knockdown on hTERT mRNA, caspase 
3 activation and apoptosis were measured. 
ABC294640 reduced hTERT mRNA abundance in 
the presence/absence of TCF21 knockdown (Fig. 
6B), suggesting that TCF21 induction is regulated 
downstream 
of 
hTERT 
down-regulation 
in 
response to targeting SPHK2/S1P signaling. 
Moreover, ABC294640 resulted in caspase 3 
activation (measured by IHC) and apoptosis 
(measured by TEM), which were prevented in 
response to shRNA-mediated knockdown of 
TCF21 (Fig. 6C-D). ShRNA-mediated knockdown 
of TCF21 was confirmed in A549 xenograft-
derived tumors ex vivo by qPCR (Fig. 6E). Sh-
RNA-mediated knockdown of TCF21 had no 
detectable effects on telomere damage in response 
to 
ABC294640-mediated 
SPHK2 
inhibition 
compared to control tumors (Fig. 6F-G). Thus, 
these data suggest a role for TCF21 induction in 
caspase 3 activation and apoptosis in response to 
the inhibition of SPHK2/S1P/hTERT axis and 
telomere damage by ABC294640, leading to 
tumor suppression.  
 
Genetic loss of SphK2 results in accelerated 
senescence and aging via telomere damage and 
p16 induction without apoptosis in mice 
To determine the physiological impact of loss of 
SphK2/S1P signaling on senescence and aging due 
to TERT alterations in a non-cancerous model, we 
have generated subsequent generations of WT and 
SphK2-/- mice (for 6 generations). SphK2-/- mice 
exhibited accelerated senescence and aging 
phenotype 
measured 
by 
increased 
beta-
galactosidase expression in their paws (37)  at 
generation 6, and decreased weight of testes at 
generation 4 or 5 compared to WT and SphK1-/- 
mice (generation matched controls) (Fig. 7A-B). 
Examining of spleen, skin and testes tissues at 
generation 6 using H&E staining also confirmed 
increased senescence and aging phenotype in 
SphK2-/- compared to WT mice.  
SphK2-/- animals at generation 6 exhibited 
splenic atrophy with decreased white blood cells 
with no germinal centers present. It should be 
noted that the splenic atrophy is common in aged 
mice and can be accompanied with cachexia. 
There was decreased erythrocyte (red blood cell) 
turn over in the SphK2-/- mice, which might be due 
to 
decreased 
numbers 
of 
erythrocytes 
in 
circulation. Moreover, we observed decreased 
thickness of the hypodermal adipose layer in the 
SphK2-/- 
mice 
with 
multiple 
areas 
of 
inflammation, increased fibrosis and abnormal 
follicle development. Also, there were fewer 
seminerferous tubules (hypoplasia) in SphK2-/- 
mice compared to wild type control testes tissues 
(Fig. 7C).  
In testes tissues, there was decreased 
mTERT abundance (measured by IHC) in SphK2-/- 
compared to WT and SphK1-/- mice (generation 6), 
whereas there was no apoptosis (measured  by 
TUNEL staining) or TCF21 induction (measured 
by IHC) in these mice (Fig. 7D). In addition, 
telomere damage induction was detected in the 
testes of SphK2-/-, but not in WT or SphK1-/- mice 
(Fig. 7E). Thus, these data indicate that loss of 
SphK2 results in accelerated senescence and aging 
starting at generation 4, which is consistent with 
decreased mTERT and induction of telomere 
damage (especially in testes tissues). However, 
accelerated senescence/aging in mice appeared to 
be independent of TCF21 and/or apoptosis 
induction.  
To further examine the effects of SphK2 
loss, confirmed by Western blotting using anti-
SphK2 antibody (38), in the induction of 
senescence, we have isolated MEFs at generations 
4-6 from WT, SphK1-/- and SphK2-/- mice, and 
measured senescence by measuring b-gal and p16 
expression. Induction of senescence was detected 
in the generation 4, 5 and 6 (G4-G6) of SphK2-/- 
compared to WT and SphK1-/- MEFs Fig. 8A-B). 
In addition, increased telomere damage was 
detected in SphK2-/- compared to WT and SphK1-/-

MEFs (Fig. 8C). Interestingly, while shRNA-
mediated knockdown of p16 had no effect on 
telomere damage induction in SphK2-/- MEFs, it 
induced caspase 3 activation compared to controls 
(Fig. 8D). Collectively, these data suggest that loss 
of SphK2/S1P results in accelerated aging and 
senescence with p16 induction in SphK2-/- 
compared to WT and SphK1-/- mice at subsequent 
generations 4-6.  
 
  
Induction of p16 distinctly mediates telomere-
damage-mediated senescence and prevents 
apoptosis in response to SPHK2/S1P/telomerase 
targeting 
To 
determine 
whether 
alterations 
of 
SPHK2/S1P/hTERT signaling induces senescence 
in A549 lung cancer cells, which lack p16 
expression (39), we measured the effects of down-
regulation or inhibition of SPHK2 on caspase 3 
activation 
and 
b-gal 
induction 
in 
the 
absence/presence of ectopic expression of p16. 
ShRNA-mediated knockdown of SPHK2 induced 
caspase 3 and ectopic expression of p16 attenuated 
this process compared to Scr-shRNA expressing 
A549 
cells 
(Fig. 
9A). 
ShRNA-dependent 
knockdown or  ABC294640-mediated inhibition 
of SPHK2 had no detectable effect on the 
induction of senescence in A549 cells, whereas 
ectopic expression of p16 with/without SPHK2 
targeting increased senescence in A549 cells 
compared to Scr-shRNA-expressing or vehicle-
treated controls (Fig. 9B). Interestingly, while 
ectopic expression of p16 had no effect on the 
induction 
telomere 
damage 
(Fig. 
9C), 
it 
completely prevented caspase 3 induction in 
response 
to 
SPHK2/S1P 
inhibition 
using 
ABC294640 compared to vehicle-treated controls 
(Fig. 9D-E). In reciprocal studies, shRNA-
dependent knockdown of p16 in H1341 human lug 
cancer cells (confirmed by qPCR, Fig. 9F) resulted 
in enhanced caspase 3 activation in response to 
SPHK2 inhibition by ABC294640 compared to 
Scr-shRNA transfected controls (Fig. 9G). Lack of 
protein abundance of p16 in A549 and H157 
human lung cancer cells compared to HeLa and 
H1341 cells, which express p16 is also confirmed 
by Western blotting (Fig. 9H). Thus, these data 
suggest that p16 expression determines the 
induction of senescence while inhibiting TCF21-
dependent caspase 3 induction in response to 
SPHK2/S1P/TERT targeting and telomere damage 
in lung cancer cells.  
 
Interaction between p16 and caspase 3 prevents 
caspase 3 activation and apoptosis in response 
to telomere damage 
To define the mechanism by which p16 activation 
forces cell to undergo senescence but not 
apoptosis, we set out studies to test a novel 
hypothesis that interaction between p16 and 
caspase 3 might limit caspase 3 activation and 
prevent apoptosis. This hypothesis was first tested 
in H1341 human lung cancer cells, which express 
p16. SPHK2 inhibition by ABC294640 mediated 
the associaton between endogenous p16 and 
caspase 3 in H1341 cells, and this interaction was 
attenuated 
in 
response 
to 
shRNA-mediated 
silencing of p16 compatred to controls (Fig. 10A). 
Similar data were also observed when SPHK2 
expression was knocked down using shRNA, 
which resulted in increased association between 
ectopically expressed WT-p16 and caspase 3 in 
A549 cells with/without ABC294640 exposure 
compared to Scr-shRNA/vector-transfected and 
vehicle-treated 
controls 
using 
PLA 
and 
immunofluorescence (Fig. 10B-C). These data 
were also consistent when we measured the 
binding between recombinant and purified human 
p16 and caspase 3 proteins (40) using OpenSPR 
localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) 
biosensor at various protein concentrations. The 
data showed that purified p16 interacted with 
caspase 3 (KD, equilibrium dissociation constant= 
1.82 x 10-8 +/- 6.5 x 10-9 M) (Supplemental Fig. 
S7A-B). Thus, these data suggest that p16 binding 
might prevent the activation of pro-caspase 3. 
Next, using a molecular simulation and 
docking, we  generated a model in silico for 
protein-protein interaction between p16 and 
capsase 
3 
using 
their 
exisiting 
structures 
determined by x-ray crystallography (Fig. 10D). 
The model suggested that the interaction between 
p16 and caspase 3 might involve Ser152 of p16 
(turquoise) and Gly251 of caspase 3 (grey), which 
is within the activation domain of caspase 3 
(His237-Cys285). To validate this model, we 
ectopically expressed WT-p16 and mutant-p16 
with Ser152 to Ala conversion, and measured their 
association in p16-null A549 cells using anti-p16 
and anti-caspase 3 antibodies by PLA compared to 
vector-transfected controls. The data showed that

WT-p16 and caspase 3 association was induced in 
response to SPHK2 inhibition using ABC294640, 
whereas there was no detectable association 
between Ser152Ala-p16 in A549 cells (Fig. 10E). 
Moreover, ectopic expression of WT-p16 and not 
Ser152Ala-p16, largely protected cells from caspase 
3 activation in response to ABC294640 exposure 
compared to vector-transfected controls (Fig 10F). 
Ectopic expression of WT-p16 and Ser152Ala-p16 
in A549 cells was confirmed using Western 
blotting compared to vector-transfected controls 
using anti-p16 and anti-actin antibodies (Fig. 
10G). Importantly, interaction between p16 and 
caspase 3 was also detected in testes tissues 
isolated from Sphk2-deficient mice at generation 
5, which expressed SA-ß-Gal, but not in testes 
isolated from matched WT or SphK1-/- mice, 
which were also negative for SA-ß-Gal expression 
(Fig. 10H). Thus, these data suggest that 
interaction between p16 and caspase 3 involves 
the S152 residue of p16, and that this interaction is 
key to prevent caspase 3 activation, which forces 
senescence while limiting apoptotic cell death in 
response 
to 
SPHK2/S1P 
inhibition, 
and 
subsequent telomere damage.       
 
Discussion 
Here, our data revealed that SPHK2-generated 
S1P binds and stabilizes TERT involving its D684 
residue via mimicking TERT phosphorylation at 
S921, which protects telomere damage, and results 
in delayed senescence and protection from 
apoptosis. 
These 
data 
also 
suggested that 
targeting/inhibition of the SPHK2/S1P/telomerase 
axis results in telomere damage, which signals 
TCF21-dependent caspase 3 activation in cancer 
cells or immortalized MEFs, or p16-dependent 
senescence and accelerated aging phenotype in 
non-cancerous lung fibroblasts, primary MEFs 
(non-immortalized), and non-cancerous testes 
tissues in subsequent generations of SphK2-/- mice 
(Fig. 11). Mechanistically, this study demonstrated 
that interaction between p16 and caspase 3, 
involving Ser152 of p16, prevents caspase 3 
activation in response to telomere damage, forcing 
cells to selectively induce senescence but not 
apoptosis. Our previous study revealed that S1P-
TERT binding, involving the D684 residue, 
stabilizes TERT via phosphomimic function of 
S1P at Ser921 to regulate hTERT stability (27). 
Here, the data further suggested that while 
targeting 
SPHK2/S1P 
induces 
hTERT 
degradation, resulting in telomere damage and 
apoptosis, expression of phosphomimic mutant of 
hTERT with S921D conversion even in the 
absence of S1P binding due to D684A mutation 
prevented telomere damage in response to SPHK2 
inhibition. It will be interesting to define whether 
phosphomimic function of S1P upon binding to 
other proteins, such as HDAC1/2(26) and 
prohibitin 2 (41), or TRAF2 (22) and PPAR-
gamma (42), play any roles in the regulation of 
their biological functions. 
Interestingly, 
our 
current 
data 
also 
suggested that TCF21-dependent caspase 3 
activation plays a key role in  tumor suppression 
downstream of telomere damage in response to 
SPHK2/S1P targeting. TCF21 was reported as a 
tumor suppressor, whose expression is suppressed 
by epigenetic methylation in lung tumor tissues 
and cells (43,44). It was shown recently that 
TCF21 is reactivated by the expression of long 
noncoding RNA TARID, which enhanced its 
demethylation via GADD45A (45). It is, however, 
remains unknown whether SPHK2/S1P/TERT 
inhibition results in TCF21 activation through 
TARID/GADD45A.  
In these studies, targeting SPHK2/S1P 
signaling 
using 
molecular 
(shRNA) 
or 
pharmacologic (ABC294640) tools resulted in 
consistent telomere damage in various cell types. 
Although ABC294640 is known to have off target 
effects, especially inducing the accumulation of 
dihydro-ceramides due to inhibition of DES 
(46,47), knocking down of SphK2 using shRNA 
had no effect on dihydro-ceramide accumulation 
(Supplemental Fig S4B). Thus, these data suggest 
that telomere damage evoked by SphK2 silencing 
or inhibition appears to be independent of 
ceramide/dihydro-ceramide alterations. However, 
effects of shRNA-mediated knockdown of SphK2 
or its inhibition using ABC294640 on S1P versus 
ceramide and/or dihydroceramide accumulation in 
nuclear membranes need to be determined. 
 
It was interesting that SphK2-/- mice 
showed accelerated telomere damage/senescence 
and aging phenotype after four generations. This 
was somewhat expected as mTERT-/- showed 
signs of telomere damage and aging phenotype 
after generation 4 also (48). Interestingly, while 
genetic loss of SphK2 induced senescence and 
aging due to telomerase instability and increased

telomere damage without induction of apoptosis in 
SphK2-/- compared to WT and SphK1-/- knockout 
mice, 
downregulation 
and/or 
inhibition 
of 
SPHK2/S1P/TERT signaling resulted in TCF21-
dependent caspase 3 activation down stream of 
telomere damage in lung cancer cells. Our data 
further suggested that activation of p16 was the 
key to decide the fate of cells to succumb in 
senescence rather than apoptosis, as ectopic 
expression of p16 in p16-deficient cancer cells 
induced senescence by preventing caspase 3 
activation. These data are consistent with a role of 
p16 in the protection of ATR4-mediated DNA 
damage in response to dysfunctional telomeres 
(49). Our data are also in agreement that in 
addition to p53 signaling, p16 is another effector 
protein for the telomere damage signaling (50). 
Moreover, recent studies suggest that p16-
expressing cells shorten healthy life span (51), and 
that targeting p16 to clear senescent cells delays 
aging-related disorders detected in adipose tissue, 
skeletal muscle and eye (52), or rejuvenates aged 
hematopoietic stem cells in mice (53). These 
studies are consistent with our data, which provide 
a mechanistic link between p16 and inhibition of 
caspase 3 and apoptosis, supporting that targeting 
p16 induces clearance of senescent cells possibly 
by releaving caspase 3 from p16 for activation of 
caspase 3 and apoptosis. To this end, our data 
might have important clinical implications such 
that inhibition of p16 would switch senescent 
phenotype to apoptosis in tumors, improving 
tumor elimination and suppression, at least in part, 
in response to SPHK2/telomerase targeting.  
Nevertheless, these data provide a novel 
link between the regulation of senescence versus 
caspase 3-dependent apoptosis, which is controlled 
by p16 signaling at least in response to telomere 
DNA damage evoked by SPHK2/S1P/TERT 
inhibition.

tumors were palpable the mice were either treated 
with vehicle control of with ABC294640 at 100 
mg/kg body weight for 21 days. Tumor volume 
was measured every alternative day using digital 
calipers and treatments were performed using oral 
gavage method every day. At the end of the 
experiment the mice were euthanized and tumor 
tissues were collected (27, 54-56). 
 
Xenograft-derived

SCID 
mice 
expressing stable shTCF21 
A549 cells stably expressing control shRNA or 
shRNA against TCF21 (TRCN0000015564, Open 
biosystems) were used for the experiment. Two 
million cells (100 µl) were implanted into both 
flanks of female SCID mice (n=4 mice per group/ 
one tumor on each side of the flank) and when the 
tumors were palpable the mice were either treated 
with vehicle control of with ABC294640 at 100 
mg/kg body weight for 21 days. Tumor volume 
was measured every alternative day using digital 
calipers and treatments were performed using oral

Expression and purification of caspase 3. Wild-
type human caspase-3 was expressed in E. coli and 
purified using Ni-NTA agarose affinity resin, as 
desccribed (58,59). Briefly, C-terminal His6-
tagged 
plasmids 
pET23b-Casp3-His 
was 
purchased from Addgene (plasmid #’s 11821 and 
90090, respectively) and transformed into E. coli 
strain C41(DE3). A single colony was used to 
inoculate 50 mL of LB containing 50 µg/mL 
ampicillin and grown overnight at 37 °C.  This 
culture was diluted 1:2000 into 4x250 mL of LB 
media and incubated at 37 °C until the OD600 
reached 3-5.  Rich media was exchanged to a 
minimal formulation suitable for high-density

IPTG induction by spinning the cells gently at 
5,000 x g for 10 min at 20-25 oC, and then 
resuspending in an equal volume of minimal 
media.  Cultures were incubated at 37 °C until the 
OD600 increased by at least 1 unit, the incubator 
was lowered to 18 °C, and protein expression was 
induced with 1 mM IPTG for 16 h at 170 rpm.  
The cells were pelleted at 10,000 x g for 20 min 
and were resuspended in lysis/binding buffer A 
(20mM HEPES pH 7.5, 1M NaCl, 20 mM 
imidazole 
and 
10 
mM 
β-mercaptoethanol). 
Following sonication and centrifugation at 18,000 
x g for 30 min, the cleared lysate was applied to an 
equilibrated 1 ml HisTrap FF column (GE 
Healthcare, catalog No. 17-5255-01), washed with 
10 column volumes of wash buffer (10% Buffer B; 
20mM  HEPES pH 7.5, 1M NaCl, 250 mM 
imidazole and 10 mM β-mercaptoethanol) and 
eluted by a linear gradient of imidazole from 10-
70% over 40 column volumes using an ÄKTA 
start FPLC (GE Healthcare Life Sciences). The 
eluted fractions were analyzed by SDS–PAGE and 
fractions containing caspase-3 were supplemented 
with 5 mM TCEP, concentrated to 2 mL and 
applied to a HiPrep™ 16/60 Sephacryl™ S-200 
HR size exclusion column in SEC Buffer C (50 
mM HEPES pH 7.5, 300 mM NaCl, 10 mM β-
mercaptoethanol 1 mM EDTA, and 10% glycerol).  
Fractions containing pure caspase-3 as determined 
by 4-20% SDS-PAGE were pooled, quantified, 
and stored at -80 °C as 1 mL aliquots.   
 
Molecular 
modeling 
and 
OpenSPR 
for 
measurements of protein-protein interactions 
The exisiting PDB files containing NMR structure 
of p16 (2A5E) and X-ray crystallography structure 
of caspase 3 (5IBP) from RSCB (www.rscb.org) 
were 
transferred 
into 
ZDOCK 
Server 
(http://zdock.umassmed.edu/). The top model was 
then used to predict the sites of association 
between p16 and caspase 3, as we described (57). 
 
The protein-protein  association between 
recombinant 
purified 
human 
p16 
(Novus 
Biologicals, NBP2-35199) and caspase 3 was 
measured  using an OpenSPR localized surface 
plasmon resonance (LSPR) biosensor (Nicoya Life 
Science, Inc., Kitchener, Canada), as described 
previously (60). In short, 100 µL (50 µg/ml) of 
p16Ink4a, purchased 
from 
Novus 
Biologicals 
(#NBP2-35199), was immobilized on a COOH 
sensor chip (Nicoya # SEN-AU-100-12-COOH) at 
a flow rate of 20 µL/min in 1X PBS buffer (pH 
7.4) and 0.1% v/v Tween 20.  Free activated 
carboxyl groups were deactivated with the 
addition of 100 µL blocking buffer (Nicoya).  The 
immobilized ligand was washed with analyte 
running buffer (1X PBS, pH 7.4; 0.1% v/v Tween 
20; 0.1% w/v BSA) until a stable baseline was 
achieved. Buffer-matched recombinant caspase 3 
(80 µL; 50-1000 nM) analytes were injected into 
the flow cell at a rate of 20 µL/min.  Following a 
4-minute interaction time, the dissociation was 
recorded for an additional 16 minutes.  The ligand-
immobilized sensor chip was regenerated between 
each analyte injection using 20 mM HCl at a 150 
µL/min flow rate.  Kinetic binding analysis was 
performed with the TraceDrawer software package 
(Ridgeview 
Instruments, 
Uppsala, 
Sweden). 
Sensorgram traces were fit to a 1:1 Langmuir 
model to derive association (Ka), dissociation 
(Kd), and affinity (KD) constants. 
   
Statistical Analyses 
All data are presented as mean ± SD, and group 
comparisons were performed with a two-tailed 
Student’s t test. Wilcoxon rank sum test and paired 
t-test were used to analyze small-cell and non-
small cell tumor microarray data. Tumor xenograft 
experiments 
were 
analyzed 
using 
two-way 
ANOVA with Tukey’s posthoc test and testes 
weights from G4 and G5 mice were analyzed 
using one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s posthoc 
test. The results were analysed using GraphPad 
Prism 7 software and P<0.05 was considered 
statistically significant (27, 54-56). For the 
comparison of several groups, a variance analysis 
(ANOVA) 
was 
carried 
out 
under 
normal 
distribution assumption.

panels) and Western blotting respectively (lower 
panels). Data are means ± SD from three 
independent experiments, analysed by student’s t-
test (n=3, *P=0.049).  (D) Molecular modeling for 
the predicted interaction between p16 and caspase 
3 was generated using already exisiting NMR 
structure of p16 and crystal structure caspase 3 as 
described in Materials and Methods. Ser152 of p16 
(turquoise) and Gly251 of caspase 3 (grey) were 
among key residues for the interaction between 
these two proteins. (E) Association between p16 
and caspase 3 was measured by PLA in A549 cells 
expressing 
WT-p16 
or 
p16S152A 
in 
the 
absence/presence of ABC294640. Vector-only-
transfected and vehicle-treated cells were used as 
controls. Data are means ± SD from three 
independent experiments, analysed by student’s t-
test (n=3, *P=0.010, **P=0.009, ***P=0.009). 
Quantification of PLA images were performed 
using the PLA software as described by the 
manufacturer. (F-G) Effects of ABC294640

by confocal microscopy and immunofluorescence 
using anti-caspase 3 antibody that detects activated 
caspase 3 in A549 cells expressing WT-p16 or

test (n=3, *P=0.0001, **P=0.643, ***P=0.0006). 
Vector-only-transfected and vehicle-treated cells 
were used as controls. Quantification of co-

Expression 
of 
WT-p16 
and 
p16S152A 
was 
confirmed by Western blotting (G). Vector-
transfected cell extracts were used as controls. (H) 
Association between p16 and caspase 3 was 
measured by PLA in testes tissues obtained from 
WT 
(SphK1+/+/SphK2+/+), 
SphK1-deficient 
(SphK1-/-) or SphK2-deficient (SphK2-/-) mice at 
generation 6. Data are means ± SD from three 
independent experiments, analysed by student’s t-
test (n=3, *P=0.002, **P=0.001). Quantification 
of PLA images were performed using the PLA 
software as described by the manufacturer. Scale

Fig. 11. Graphical summary. Our data suggest 
that SPHK2-generated S1P binds and stabilizes 
TERT involving its D684 residue via mimicking 
TERT phosphorylation at S921, which protects 
telomere 
damage, 
and 
results 
in 
delayed 
senescence and protection from apoptosis. Our 
data also suggest that targeting/inhibition of the 
SPHK2/S1P/telomerase axis results in telomere 
damage, which signals TCF21-dependent caspase 
3 activation in cancer cells or immortalized MEFs, 
or p16-dependent senescence and accelerated 
aging phenotype in non-cancerous primary lung 
fibroblasts, primary MEFs, or non-cancerous 
tissues, such as testes, of subsequent generations 
of SphK2-/- mice. Thus, these data reveal that p16 
abundance induces senescence and prevents 
caspase-3-dependent apoptosis in response to 
telomere damage via p16-caspase 3 interaction in 
response to targeting the SPHK2/S1P/telomerase 
axis.
