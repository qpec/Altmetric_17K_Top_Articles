Cocaine exposure alters brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression in the brain. BDNF signaling through TrkB receptors
differentially modulates cocaine self-administration, depending on the brain regions involved. In the present study, we determined how

Introduction
Numerous studies have shown that brain-derived neurotrophic
factor (BDNF) signaling through TrkB receptors plays a key role
in cocaine dependence (for review, see Corominas et al., 2007;
McGinty et al., 2010; McCarthy et al., 2012). An interaction be-
tween BDNF and the mesocorticolimbic dopamine system is be-
lieved to modulate the behavioral effects of cocaine (Altar et al.,
1992; Martin-Iverson et al., 1994; Guillin et al., 2001; Goggi et al.,
2003; Corominas et al., 2007; Lobo et al., 2010; McGinty
et al., 2010; McCarthy et al., 2012). Accordingly, forced exposure
to cocaine increases BDNF expression in the prefrontal cortex (Le
Foll et al., 2005; Fumagalli et al., 2007, 2009; Lu et al., 2010) and
Significance Statement
Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) signaling through TrkB receptors plays a well established role in cocaine reinforce-
ment.However,localmanipulationofBDNFsignalingyieldsdivergenteffects,dependingonthebrainregion,therebyquestioning
the viability of systemic TrkB targeting for the treatment of cocaine use disorders. Our study provides first-time evidence that
systemic administration of a brain-penetrant TrkB antagonist (tat-cyclotraxin-B) reduces several behavioral measures of cocaine
dependence, without altering motor performance or reinforcement by a sweet palatable solution. In addition, although cocaine
self-administration produced opposite effects on TrkB signaling in the nucleus accumbens and prefrontal cortex, tat-
cyclotraxin-B administration normalized these cocaine-induced changes in both brain regions.

 the nucleus accumbens (Filip et al., 2006; Graham et al., 2007;
Huang et al., 2011). Cocaine self-administration increases BDNF
expression not only in these cortical (McGinty et al., 2010; Sadri-
Vakili et al., 2010; Fumagalli et al., 2013) and ventral striatal
(Grimm et al., 2003; Graham et al., 2007; Fumagalli et al., 2013; Li
et al., 2013) regions innervated by dopamine neurons, but also in
the ventral tegmental area (Grimm et al., 2003; Pu et al., 2006;
Graham et al., 2009; Schmidt et al., 2012) where these dopami-
nergic neurons originate.
Cocaine intake is modulated by BDNF signaling in a brain
region-dependent manner. Local injections of BDNF into the
nucleus accumbens or the ventral tegmental area enhance co-
caine reward, cocaine self-administration, and reinstatement
of cocaine seeking (Horger et al., 1999; Lu et al., 2004, 2009;
Graham et al., 2007; Bahi et al., 2008), and intra-accumbens
infusion of BDNF antiserum and virally mediated TrkB silenc-
ing reduce various measures of cocaine dependence (Graham
et al., 2007, 2009; Bahi et al., 2008; Li et al., 2013). In contrast,
the local injection of BDNF into the medial prefrontal cortex
reduces cocaine seeking (Berglind et al., 2007, 2009; Whitfield
et al., 2011) and virally mediated BDNF silencing in this brain
region increases the motivation to take cocaine (Sadri-Vakili
et al., 2010).
The divergent effects of local TrkB signaling manipulation
prompted us to investigate the net effect of brain-wide TrkB
antagonism on measures of cocaine self-administration that
reflect the motivation to work for the drug and on relapse-like
behavior associated with compulsive cocaine seeking. How-
ever, BDNF and TrkB ligands do not undergo significant
transport across the blood–brain barrier. To allow direct de-
livery to the brain, the nontoxic transduction domain of the
tat protein from human immunodeficiency virus type 1
(HIV-1) was fused to the TrkB antagonist cyclotraxin-B (for
details, see Cazorla et al., 2010), resulting in tat-cyclotraxin-B
(TC). Intravenous administration of TC following a double-
injection procedure was previously shown to inhibit the phos-
phorylation of forebrain TrkB receptors by �50% and to
reduce anxiety-related behavior without affecting depression-
like behavior or motor performance (Cazorla et al., 2010). In
the present study, the behavioral effects of TC were tested in
rats given limited (1 h/d) or extended (6 h/d) access to cocaine
self-administration (for details, see Ahmed and Koob, 1998;
Orio et al., 2009; Wee et al., 2012). The stable short access
(ShA) cocaine intake is believed to reflect nondependent
drug intake, whereas the long access (LgA)-induced escalation
of cocaine intake is thought to reflect the transition to
compulsive-like drug taking that is observed in drug depen-
dence (for review, see Koob, 2009; Koob and Volkow, 2010).
In addition, we analyzed TrkB signaling in the nucleus ac-
cumbens and prefrontal cortex to determine the role of these
two dopamine-innervated brain regions in the modulation of
cocaine self-administration by TC. Specifically, we measured
the effect of cocaine self-administration and TC pretreatment
on the total and phosphorylated levels of TrkB, as well as Akt
and ERK, two major downstream effectors of TrkB (for re-
view, see Duman and Voleti, 2012). Finally, we examined the
effect of cocaine self-administration and TC pretreatment on
TrkB levels in the ventral tegmental area.
Materials and Methods
Animals. Twenty-two male Wistar rats (Charles River Laboratories),
weighing 350 � 5 g at the beginning of the experiment, were housed in
groups of two or three in Macrolon type III cages under a 12 h re-
versed day/night cycle (lights off at 8:00 A.M.). Food and water were
available ad libitum except during behavioral testing. All procedures
described below were approved by The Scripps Research Institute
Animal Care and Use Committee, and were performed in accordance
with national and international laws and guidelines for the care and
use of laboratory animals.
Surgery. Rats were implanted with a Micro-Renathane catheter (in-
ner diameter, 0.3 mm; outer diameter, 0.64 mm; catalog #MRE037,
Braintree Scientific, Inc.) into the right external jugular vein accord-
ing to previously reported procedures (Wee et al., 2007). This aseptic
surgery procedure was performed under isoflurane anesthesia (2–
3%). After surgery, rats were given an analgesic (2.5 mg/kg, s.c.; Flu-
nixin, Sigma-Aldrich) and an antibiotic (0.033 mg, i.v.; Cefazolin,
Sagent Pharmaceuticals) treatment for at least 1 week. The catheter
was flushed twice daily with heparinized saline (30 USP/ml, Hospira)
during the entire experiment.
Self-administration chambers. Cocaine self-administration was
performed in standard operant chambers (28 � 26 � 20 cm; Med
Associates Inc.) that were placed in ventilated, light- and sound-
attenuating cubicles. The cocaine self-administration chambers were
equipped with a swivel system allowing rats to move freely during
self-administration sessions, whereas self-administration chambers
for the glucose/saccharin solution were equipped with an acrylic
drinking cup in the center of the wall between two levers. In both
cages, drugs were delivered by a 15 rpm syringe pump (Razel Scien-
tific Instruments). The start of a session was signaled by the presen-
tation of two retractable levers in the self-administration chamber.
Pressing the right lever was programmed to deliver cocaine (volume,
0.1 ml in 4 s) or the glucose/saccharin solution (volume, 0.1 ml in
0.5 s), whereas pressing the left lever had no programmed conse-
quences. During drug administration, a stimulus light above the ac-
tive lever was illuminated for 20 s for the cocaine solution and for 30 s
for the glucose/saccharin solution, both indicating a timeout period
when additional lever presses did not result in fluid delivery.
Cocaine training. One week after surgery, rats were trained to self-
administer cocaine (0.5 mg/kg/infusion) for 12 d under a fixed ratio 1
(FR1) schedule of reinforcement (one lever press resulted in one drug
injection) for 1 h/d. The first day of cocaine training was labeled
experimental day 1 (Fig. 1).
Escalation of cocaine intake. After training, rats were divided into
two groups matched by the number of infusions during the final
training session. One group of rats continued to self-administer co-
caine (0.5 mg/kg/infusion) in daily 1 h sessions (ShA), whereas the
other group of rats self-administered the same cocaine dose in daily
6 h sessions (LgA) for 22 d (Fig. 1). Twenty-two rats were initially
exposed to cocaine self-administration (ShA, n � 11; LgA, n � 11).
Over time, three rats had to be excluded because of occlusion of the
intravenous catheter (ShA, n � 2; LgA, n � 1). The number of rats
included in each experiment is indicated in the figure legends.

Verheij et al. • Systemic TrkB Antagonist Reduces Cocaine Reward
 intravenous injection of various doses (2.5, 5.0, 7.5, and 10.0 mg/kg/
0.5 ml) of the TrkB inhibitor cyclotraxin-B was tested on cocaine
self-administration under both ShA and LgA conditions. To allow
penetration into the brain, the nontoxic transduction domain of the
tat protein from HIV-1 (Gump and Dowdy, 2007) was fused to
cyclotraxin-B (for details, see Cazorla et al., 2010), resulting in TC
(custom made by NeoPeptide). The ineffective tat peptide lacking the
cyclotraxin-B sequence [tat empty (TE)] served as a control (Cazorla
et al., 2010). TC and TE were given in a within-subjects Latin-square
design, in which 8 test days were separated by drug-free [no tat (NT)]
days (Fig. 1). As previously reported, rats received two intravenous
injections of TC or TE 60 min apart (Cazorla et al., 2010) and were
placed in the self-administration chambers immediately after the sec-
ond administration.
Effects of TC on progressive ratio responding. To test the effects of TC
on the motivation to work for cocaine, rats were allowed to self-
administer cocaine under a progressive ratio (PR) schedule of rein-
forcement (Hodos, 1961). The number of lever presses required to
obtain the next infusion of cocaine exponentially increased according
to the following equation: number of responses per infusion � (5 �
e (injection number � 0.2)) � 5 (Richardson and Roberts, 1996). When a
rat failed to achieve the response requirement within a period of 30
min, the PR session ended and breakpoints were recorded. We chose
to test the effect of 7.5 mg/kg TC on PR responding, based on the
effect of this dose on FR1 responding in ShA and LgA rats.
Effects of TC on glucose/saccharin self-administration. To analyze
whether TC also altered the self-administration of a nondrug rein-
forcer, rats were briefly trained (four sessions) to press for the highly
palatable reinforcer “supersac” (3% w/v glucose and 0.125% w/v sac-
charin; Martin-Fardon and Weiss, 2014). Given that the above-
mentioned experiments revealed that 7.5 mg/kg TC reduced cocaine
self-administration for a period of 90 min (Table 1), the 30 min
lasting glucose/saccharin test was performed between 30 and 60 min
after the second 7.5 mg/kg TC injection to ensure the best match
between behavioral testing and the pharmacokinetic profile of TC.
Re-escalation and extinction. Following self-administration of the
glucose/saccharin solution, cocaine intake was reduced by �20% (see
Results). Rats were re-exposed to cocaine with ShA and LgA until
cocaine intake during these re-escalation sessions no longer differed
from the cocaine intake observed on experimental day 35 (8 d; Fig. 1).
Cocaine was then replaced with saline solution, and extinction ses-
sions of 4 h were performed daily until the rats received no more than
three saline infusions per hour.
Effects of TC on reinstatement of cocaine intake. Following extinc-
tion, rats were again given access to cocaine (0.5 mg/kg/infusion)
self-administration for four sessions of 1 h duration, during which the
reinstatement of cocaine intake was triggered by a single manual
intravenous infusion of cocaine. The effect of TC or TE (7.5 mg/kg)
pretreatment was tested.
Effects of TC on BDNF system-associated proteins. A separate cohort
of 25 rats was subjected to twelve 1 h sessions of cocaine self-
administration followed by twenty-two 6 h sessions, as described
above. An additional cocaine self-administration session was con-
ducted, before which rats were pretreated with TC (n � 13) or TE
(n � 12), as described above. Another control group of rats (n � 10)
underwent surgery, but had no access to cocaine and was pretreated
with TE before being killed. These animals were not exposed to saline
self-administration because rats do not lever press for this nonre-
warding solution. However, rats were handled and their catheters
were flushed on a daily basis. All rats were killed by decapitation 60

 min after the start of the final self-administration session (i.e., 60 min
after the second TC/TE injection). Bilateral punches of nucleus ac-
cumbens and ventral tegmental area, and a medial punch of prefron-
tal cortex were collected from freshly dissected brain sections of 2 mm
using a 1.2-mm-diameter needle (Verheij et al., 2008). Western blot
analysis was conducted to measure the levels of total and phosphor-
ylated TrkB, Akt, and ERK, as previously described by Giannotti et al.
(2014). Briefly, punched brain regions were homogenized by sonica-
tion using a cold buffer containing 0.32 M sucrose, 1 mM HEPES
solution, 0.1 mM EGTA, and 0.1 mM PMSF, pH 7.4, in the presence of
a complete set of protease inhibitors and a phosphatase inhibitor
cocktail. Equal amounts of protein were measured under reducing
conditions on the criterion TGX precast gels (Bio-Rad Laboratories)
and then were electrophoretically transferred onto polyvinylidene
difluoride membranes (GE Healthcare). Blots were blocked for 1 h at
room temperature with 10% nonfat dry milk in TBS plus 0.1%
Tween-20 buffer, incubated with antibodies against the phosphory-
lated forms of the proteins, and then stripped and reprobed with the
antibodies against the corresponding total proteins. The following
primary antibodies were used: anti-phospho-TrkB Y706 (1:1000;
Santa Cruz Biotechnology); anti-TrkB (1:750; Santa Cruz Biotechnol-
ogy); anti-phospho-ERK1 T202/Y204 (1:1000; Cell Signaling Tech-
nology); anti-total ERK1 (1:5000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology);
anti-phospho-Akt S473 (1:1000; Cell Signaling Technology); anti-
total Akt (1:1000; Cell Signaling Technology); and anti �-actin (1:
10,000; Sigma-Aldrich). Results were standardized using �-actin as
the control protein, which was detected by evaluating the band
density at 43 kDa. Immunocomplexes were visualized by chemilumi-
nescence using the Chemidoc MP Imaging System (Bio-Rad Labora-
tories).
Data analysis. Data are expressed as the mean � SEM. The effects of
TC on cocaine or glucose/saccharin self-administration were ana-
lyzed using a two-way or one-way ANOVA with a correction for
repeated measures when required. The effects of TC on cocaine-
induced protein regulation were analyzed using a one-way ANOVA.
Post hoc comparisons were performed by means of a Student’s t test or
least significant difference test, depending on the number of experi-
mental groups to be compared. Prism 6.0 (GraphPad) was used to
analyze all the data.
Results
Systemic injection of a brain-penetrant TrkB antagonist
reduces responding and motivation for cocaine
self-administration
After training, rats responded 12.3 � 1.6 times/h for cocaine
(Fig. 2A, session 12). LgA, but not ShA, cocaine self-
administration resulted in an escalation of the drug intake
over sessions [Fig. 2A; access � session interaction (two-way
ANOVA for repeated measures): F(22,440) � 25.4, p � 0.001;
session effect LgA (one-way ANOVA for repeated measures):
F(22,220) � 10.74, p � 0.001, session effect ShA (one-way
ANOVA for repeated measures): p � n.s.]. In contrast to ShA
cocaine self-administration, LgA cocaine self-administration
resulted in an escalation of the drug intake during the
first hour [Fig. 2B; access � session interaction (two-way
ANOVA): F(1,40) � 10.5, p � 0.002; session effect LgA (one-
way ANOVA): F(1,20) � 19.91, p � 0.001; session effect ShA
(one-way ANOVA): p � n.s.]. In addition to the differences in
cocaine intake under an FR1 schedule of reinforcement (Fig.
2A,B), cocaine intake under a PR schedule of reinforcement
was also found to be larger in LgA than ShA rats [Fig. 2C;
access effect (one-way ANOVA): F(1,20) � 4.75, p � 0.042].
The control peptide of TC, labeled TE, did not alter cocaine
self-administration under both ShA [Fig. 3A; treatment effect
and treatment � session interaction (two-way ANOVA for
repeated measures): p � n.s.] and LgA [Fig. 3B; treatment
effect and treatment � session interaction (two-way ANOVA
for repeated measures): p � n.s.] conditions. The TrkB inhib-
itor TC dose-dependently reduced cocaine intake under both
ShA [Fig. 3C; dose effect (one-way ANOVA for repeated mea-
sures): F(4,40) � 23.5, p � 0.001] and LgA [Fig. 3D; dose effect:

ANOVA for repeated measures): F(20,200) � 2.88, p � 0.001]
conditions. The intermediate dose of 7.5 mg/kg TC decreased
PR responding in both ShA [Fig. 3E; treatment effect (one-way

Systemic injection of a brain-penetrant TrkB antagonist
reduces cocaine-induced reinstatement of drug-taking
behavior
To analyze the effects of TC on drug-induced reinstatement of
cocaine intake, rats were first re-escalated to previous cocaine
intake levels [Fig. 5A; session effect: F(7,119) � 5.56, p � 0.001;
access � session interaction (two-way ANOVA for repeated mea-
sures): F(7,119) � 6.50, p � 0.001], followed by an extinction
period. LgA rats returned to less than 3 infusions per h later than
ShA rats [Fig. 5B; session effect: F(12,204) � 12.2, p � 0.001; ac-
cess � session interaction (two-way ANOVA for repeated mea-
sures): F(12,204) � 4.19, p � 0.001].
As expected, cocaine-induced reinstatement of drug taking
was larger in LgA than in ShA rats [Fig. 6A; reinstatement �
access interaction (two-way ANOVA): F(1,34) � 4.31, p �
0.046; reinstatement effect of ShA (one-way ANOVA):
F(1,16) � 6.71, p � 0.020; reinstatement effect of LgA (one-way
ANOVA): F(1,18) � 17.82, p � 0.002]. The intermediate dose
of 7.5 mg/kg TC reduced the reinstatement of cocaine intake
in both ShA rats [Fig. 6B; treatment effect (one-way ANOVA):
F(1,16) � 7.01, p � 0.018] and LgA rats [Fig. 6C; treatment
effect (one-way ANOVA): F(1,18) � 5.39, p � 0.032]. The la-
tency to the first cocaine self-infusion was shorter in rats
primed with cocaine compared with rats primed with saline
[Fig. 6D; reinstatement effect (two-way ANOVA): F(1,34) �
58.60, p � 0.001; reinstatement � access interaction (two-way
ANOVA): p � n.s.] and the latency of the first self-infusion
postcocaine prime was shorter in LgA than in ShA rats [Fig.
6D; access effect (one-way ANOVA): F(1,17) � 6.29, p �
0.023]. Interestingly, TC increased this latency [Fig. 6E (ShA);
treatment effect (one-way ANOVA): F(1,16) � 47.86, p �
0.001; Fig. 6F (LgA); treatment effect (one-way ANOVA):
F(1,18) � 5.20, p � 0.035], and did so to a greater extent in LgA
rats than in ShA rats [Fig. 6, compare E, F; treatment � access
interaction (two-way ANOVA): F(1,34) � 3.90, p � 0.054].
Effects of a brain-penetrant TrkB antagonist on active and
inactive lever presses and timeout responses
The above-mentioned effect of TC on cocaine self-administration
underFR1andPRschedulesinbothShAandLgAratswasdrivenby
a selective decrease in active lever presses (Table 1, group A, left
column), which was not accompanied by changes in timeout re-
sponding (Table 1, group A, middle column) or inactive lever
presses (Table 1, group A, right column). TC did not change active
(Table 1, group B, left column), timeout (Table 1, group B, middle
column), or inactive (Table 1, group B, right column) responses for
glucose/saccharinineithergroupofanimals.Finally,TCreducedthe
number of active presses (Table 1, group C, left column) and time-

ment, which was not accompanied by a change in inactive lever
presses (Table 1, group C, right column).
Systemic injection of a brain-penetrant TrkB antagonist
reverses cocaine self-administration-induced changes in TrkB
signaling in the nucleus accumbens and prefrontal cortex
A separate cohort of LgA rats pretreated with TC was used to
analyze TrkB signaling in the nucleus accumbens, medial pre-
frontal cortex, and ventral tegmental area. Cocaine intake in this
second cohort was comparable to the intake of the first cohort
used for behavioral characterization [first hour intake: 28 � 5.5
infusions (second cohort) vs 29 � 1.5 infusions (first cohort);

Discussion
Cocaine self-administration
Consistent with previous studies, cocaine
self-administration under LgA, but not
ShA, conditions resulted in an escalation
of drug intake over time (Ahmed and
Koob, 1998; Orio et al., 2009; Wee et al.,
2012). Compared with ShA animals, LgA
animals showed increased motivation for
cocaine intake, as indicated by increased
breakpoints during a PR schedule of rein-
forcement. After 10 d of abstinence, the
intake of cocaine re-escalated only in ani-
mals that had LgA to cocaine. During ex-
tinction, responding diminished more
slowly in LgA than in ShA rats. During
reinstatement, the latency to first self-
infusion was shorter and subsequent co-
caine intake was larger in rats that had LgA
to the drug. The finding that ShA and
LgA rats did not differ in their glucose/
saccharin intake corroborates the no-
tion that the mechanisms mediating
self-administration of palatable solu-
tions and cocaine are not identical
(Vendruscolo et al., 2010).
Tat-cyclotraxin-B reduces
cocaine self-administration
Systemic administration of the brain-penetrant TrkB antagonist TC
dose-dependently decreased cocaine self-administration in both
ShAandLgArats.TCalsoeffectivelyreducedthemotivationtowork
for cocaine as well as the drug-induced reinstatement of cocaine
takinginbothgroupsofanimals.Incontrasttorepeatedpostsession
intra-accumbal infusions of BDNF antiserum that produced a long-
lasting reduction in various measures of cocaine dependence (Gra-
ham et al., 2007), the acute presession systemic injections of TC
decreased cocaine self-administration for �2 h. Differential half-
lives of systemically administered TC and locally infused BDNF an-
tiserum may explain this discrepancy. In addition, an action of TC
outside of the nucleus accumbens may also shorten the duration of
itsinhibitoryeffectoncocaineself-administration.Long-termtreat-
ment with TC, before or after the cocaine self-administration ses-
sions, may lead to longer-lasting behavioral effects. The finding that
rats repeatedly treated with the control peptide TE showed cocaine
self-administrationlevelssimilartothoseinNT-treatedratssuggests
that the fusion peptide does not produce major side effects on oper-
ant behavior. In addition, TC did not alter the intake of a highly
rewarding sweet solution, demonstrating that the effect of TC on
self-administration is specific for cocaine reward. These results sup-
port the hypothesis that BDNF signaling in the mesolimbic dopa-
mine pathway is not recruited by sweet reinforcers (Grimm et al.,
2003; Graham et al., 2009), and further indicate that TC-induced
inhibition of cocaine self-administration cannot be attributed to a
reduction of motor performance. Altogether, the data suggest that
BDNF–TrkB signaling is not engaged upon moderate activation of

 upon excessive activity of this system by cocaine. In addition, our
data suggest that BDNF–TrkB signaling is activated by cocaine be-
fore the transition into dependence because we observed similar
effects of TC in both ShA and LgA rats.
Brain region-specific changes in TrkB signaling after
cocaine self-administration
At the molecular level, the increases in TrkB signaling that we
observed in the nucleus accumbens and ventral tegmental area of
cocaine self-administering rats are consistent with the increases
in BDNF protein levels previously reported in these brain regions
following cocaine self-administration (Grimm et al., 2003; Pu et
al., 2006; Graham et al., 2007, 2009;
Schmidt et al., 2012; Fumagalli et al., 2013;
Li et al., 2013). The decrease in TrkB sig-
naling that we observed in the prefrontal
cortex is more surprising given that the
BDNF protein level in this brain region
was previously reported to be increased by
cocaine (Fumagalli et al., 2007, 2013; Lu et
al., 2010; McGinty et al., 2010; Sadri-
Vakili et al., 2010). However, in these pre-
vious studies, BDNF upregulation in the
prefrontal cortex was detected several
hours to days after the last cocaine expo-
sure, while we collected brain samples
immediately after the last cocaine self-
administration session. In addition, the
decrease in TrkB signaling we observed
could represent a postsynaptic adapta-
tion independent of BDNF synthesis and
release.
Tat-cyclotraxin-B normalizes cocaine
self-administration-induced changes in
TrkB signaling
We found that pretreatment with TC
reverses the effects of cocaine self-
administration on TrkB signaling in the
nucleus
accumbens
and
prefrontal
cortex. Cyclotraxin-B is a potent and
specific inhibitor of TrkB, and the TC
administration procedure used in the
present study was previously shown to
reduce the phosphorylation of central
TrkB receptors by �50% (Cazorla et al.,
2010). Combining our results with
the existing literature on the effects of
BDNF system modulation in the meso-
corticolimbic
dopaminergic
pathway
(Horger et al., 1999; Lu et al., 2004,
2009; Graham et al., 2007, 2009; Bahi et
al., 2008; Li et al., 2013), we propose that
the reduction in TrkB signaling induced
by TC in the nucleus accumbens drives
the reduction in cocaine self-admin-
istration. We further hypothesize that
the reversal of the cocaine-induced de-
crease in cortical TrkB signaling by TC
indirectly results from the blunting of
the cocaine-induced TrkB activation in
the nucleus accumbens. According to
this framework, the inhibitory effect of
LgA cocaine self-administration on TrkB signaling in the pre-
frontal cortex would occur secondary to the increased signal-
ing observed in the nucleus accumbens. Such antagonistic
feedback from the nucleus accumbens to the prefrontal cortex
could be relayed via the ventral tegmental area, which receives
inhibitory GABAergic inputs from the nucleus accumbens and
sends dopaminergic projections to the prefrontal cortex
(Russo and Nestler, 2013), or via cortico–striatal–pallidal–
thalamic loops that provide a basal ganglia–cortical feedback
(Haber et al., 2000). Reduction of cocaine self-administration
by TC may ultimately result from the combined reversal of
cocaine effects on TrkB signaling in the nucleus accumbens
Figure 8.

 and prefrontal cortex, as both reduced TrkB signaling in the
nucleus accumbens and increased TrkB signaling in the pre-
frontal cortex have previously been found to reduce cocaine
seeking (Horger et al., 1999; Lu et al., 2004, 2009; Berglind et
al., 2007, 2009; Graham et al., 2007, 2009; Bahi et al., 2008;
Sadri-Vakili et al., 2010; Whitfield et al., 2011; Li et al., 2013).
In both brain regions, changes in TrkB signaling were accom-
panied by similar changes in Akt, but not in ERK, indicating
that the behavioral effects of cocaine and TC are intracellular
pathway specific.
An alternative interpretation of our molecular data would
be that TC-induced changes in TrkB/Akt signaling result
from, rather than drive, the reduced cocaine intake. However,
the fact that TC did not affect TrkB and pTrkB levels in the
ventral tegmental area of cocaine self-administering rats does
not support this interpretation. The latter finding suggests
that the effects of TC on TrkB signaling result from a brain
region-specific action of TC, rather than being an indirect
consequence of lower levels of cocaine exposure throughout
the brain. Although the mechanism underlying this regional
specificity of TC activity remains to be determined, it is worth
noting that ANA-12, another brain-penetrant TrkB antagonist
that, similar to TC, displays anxiolytic-like properties, exerts
more potent TrkB inhibition in striatal areas than in cortical
areas (Cazorla et al., 2011).
Perspectives
Given that dopaminergic signaling in the nucleus accumbens and
prefrontal cortex plays a key role in the positive reinforcing proper-
ties of cocaine (Everitt and Robbins, 2005; Koob and Volkow, 2010;
George et al., 2012), the inhibitory effect of TC on the cocaine intake
of ShA rats probably results from a disruption of the complex inter-
play between BDNF and dopamine signaling in these dopamine-
innervatedregions.Inaddition,anactionofTContheglutamatergic
neurons regulating accumbal dopamine release may also contribute
(Berglind et al., 2009). The inhibitory effect of TC on the cocaine
intake of LgA rats raises the possibility that incentive salience driven
by negative reinforcement also involves BDNF signaling. Accord-
ingly, genetic deletion of BDNF in ventral tegmental area dop-
aminergic neurons reduces social aversion elicited by repeated
aggression (Berton et al., 2006) and systemic administration of the
brain-penetrant TrkB inhibitors TC and ANA-12 exerts anxiolytic-
like and antidepressant-like properties in
naive mice (Cazorla et al., 2010, 2011).
Therefore,thesefindingssuggestthattheef-
fects of TC on relieving the negative emo-
tional state associated with withdrawal may
also contribute to the reduction in cocaine
intake in LgA rats. Altogether, our study
validates systemic TrkB antagonism as a
potential new strategy to curb cocaine use
disorders.
