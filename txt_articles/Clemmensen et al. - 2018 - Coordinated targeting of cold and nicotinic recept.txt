Coordinated targeting of cold and nicotinic
receptors synergistically improves obesity and type
2 diabetes
Christoffer Clemmensen
et al.#
Pharmacological stimulation of brown adipose tissue (BAT) thermogenesis to increase
energy expenditure is progressively being pursued as a viable anti-obesity strategy. Here, we
report that pharmacological activation of the cold receptor transient receptor potential cation
channel subfamily M member 8 (TRPM8) with agonist icilin mimics the metabolic benefits of
cold exposure. In diet-induced obese (DIO) mice, treatment with icilin enhances energy
expenditure, and decreases body weight, without affecting food intake. To further potentiate
the thermogenic action profile of icilin and add complementary anorexigenic mechanisms, we
set out to identify pharmacological partners next to icilin. To that end, we specifically targeted
nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) subtype alpha3beta4 (α3β4), which we had
recognized as a potential regulator of energy homeostasis and glucose metabolism. Com-
binatorial targeting of TRPM8 and nAChR α3β4 by icilin and dimethylphenylpiperazinium
(DMPP) orchestrates synergistic anorexic and thermogenic pathways to reverse diet-induced
obesity, dyslipidemia, and glucose intolerance in DIO mice.

uccessful management of the global obesity epidemic is
required to halt the increasing prevalence of cardiometa-
bolic diseases1. Pharmacological stimulation of metabolic
rate was explored as a weight-lowering strategy in the first half of
the 20th century. However, harmful side effects, such as excessive
heat production and microvascular disease, following chronic
administration of drugs such as 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP) may
have contributed to direct the anti-obesity field towards appetite-
suppressants2. The now decade-old observation that humans
possess recruitable brown adipose tissue (BAT) that generates
heat in response to cold stress3–5 reinvigorated substantial
research on BAT thermogenesis and anti-obesity therapeutic
strategies aimed to increase energy expenditure.
A family of thermoreceptors, the transient receptor potential
(TRP) channels, are expressed in afferent dorsal root ganglion
(DRG) sensory neurons, and primarily function to convey
information of environmental temperature to the central nervous
system (CNS)6. The transient receptor potential cation channel
subfamily M member 8 (TRPM8) is a proximate regulator of the
cold-sensing cascade that culminates in the induction of BAT
thermogenesis to defend body temperature in response to
environmental cold7. TRPM8 can also be activated by chemical
ligands such as menthol and the high-potency small molecule
icilin7,8. Menthol-induced TRPM8 activation increases body
temperature9, BAT uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) expression, and
protects mice from diet-induced obesity10, underlining the
potential of developing TRPM8-based pharmacotherapies to treat
obesity.
Because
interventions
that
increase
energy
expenditure,
including cold exposure, frequently elicit counter-regulatory
induction of orexigenic feeding circuits11,12, complementary
anorexigenic actions are likely required to chronically reverse
metabolic imbalances. Here, we hypothesized that the nicotinic
acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) subtype α3β4 would be an ideal
pharmacological partner to TRPM8 agonism by capitalizing on
the well-described effects of smoking to suppress hunger. Phar-
macological stimulation of hypothalamic α3β4 nAChRs sup-
presses appetite via the hypothalamic-melanocortin system13.
Additionally, the nAChR α3β4 is the primary ganglionic nAChR
that upon pharmacological stimulation depolarizes BAT and
increases lipolysis14–16, and somewhat paradoxically, nAChR
activation also acts centrally to lower body temperature17,18.
Therefore, we hypothesized that pharmacological stimulation of
α3β4 will complement the thermogenic virtues of TRPM8
agonism while appropriately counter-balancing systemic hyper-
thermia and potential counter-regulatory hyperphagia. Thus, we
demonstrate that dual nAChR α3β4 and TRPM8 agonism, which
in essence biochemically mimics the two environmental stimuli
known to improve systemic metabolism—cold exposure and
cigarette smoking, evokes a cascade of physiological nodes that
harmonize to reverse obesity and type 2 diabetes
We report that a potent TRPM8 agonist, icilin, enhances
energy expenditure to lower body weight in diet-induced obese
(DIO) mice. We discovered that combining icilin with a α3β4
nAChR agonist dimethylphenylpiperazinium (DMPP) elicits
coordinated metabolic actions that synergize to lower body
weight, correct glucose intolerance, and reduce hepatic steatosis.
Mechanistically, we reveal that central melanocortin signaling as
well as sympathetic nervous system-linked thermogenesis are
indispensable for the orchestration of the complete metabolic
benefits of this novel combination strategy.
Result
Icilin increases energy expenditure and lowers body weight. To
test if the TRPM8 agonist icilin mimics the metabolic benefits of
cold exposure, we administered icilin to mice maintained on a
high-fat, high sucrose diet (HFD). Chronic treatment with icilin
for 14 days dose-dependently lowered body weight (Fig. 1a),
reflected in a reduction in body fat (Supplementary Fig. 1a). This
effect on body weight and fat mass was due to an increase in
energy expenditure (Fig. 1b), while food intake (Fig. 1c) and
locomotor activity were unaffected by icilin (Fig. 1d). In TRPM8
null mice, icilin had no effect on oxygen consumption rate
(Fig. 1e, f) or weight loss (Supplementary Fig. 3d, f), underscoring
that the ability of icilin to lower body weight by increasing energy
expenditure requires functional TRPM8. In contrast to previous
work10,19, we did not detect meaningful expression of Trpm8 in
BAT of mice housed at 30 °C or at 5 °C suggesting that the icilin
effect on BAT energy expenditure is not explained by direct
effects of icilin on adipocytes (Supplementary Fig. 1b). In agree-
ment, icilin did not increase Ucp1 transcription or oxygen con-
sumption in mouse (Supplementary Fig. 1c–d) or human
(Supplementary Fig. 1e–f) primary brown adipocytes, suggesting
indirect actions to increase thermogenesis, likely through induc-
tion of sympathetic tone.
DMPP improves diet-induced obesity and glucose intolerance.
Although the ability of icilin to increase energy expenditure seems
to be appropriately uncoupled from compensatory hyperphagia,
we hypothesized that additional pharmacology concurrently tar-
geting central satiety circuits would complement TRPM8-based
pharmacology to achieve greater weight loss. We discovered that
the nicotinic receptor α3β4 agonist DMPP dose-dependently
lowered body weight in DIO mice (Fig. 2a). Similar to nicotine
(Supplementary Fig. 2a, b), DMPP reduced body weight by
suppressing food intake (Fig. 2b). However, in contrast to nico-
tine (Supplementary Fig. 2c, d), DMPP markedly improved diet-
induced glucose intolerance, even at doses with negligible effect
on body weight change (Fig. 2c, d).
Icilin and DMPP synergistically lower body weight. Following
the results with icilin and DMPP monotherapy on energy
expenditure and appetite, respectively, we tested icilin and DMPP
in combination as a single formulation. Cotreatment with icilin
(5 mg/kg) and DMPP (10 mg/kg) synergistically lowered body
weight in DIO mice (Fig. 3a) coinciding with a robust reduction
in food intake (Fig. 3b) and increased energy expenditure (Sup-
plementary Fig. 3a). The synergistic weight-lowering effects of
DMPP and icilin cotreatment were corroborated by chronic
treatment studies (Fig. 5a, Supplementary Fig. 3b). To explore the
central hypothalamic actions of the combination therapy, we
assessed c-FOS immune reactivity as an indirect measure of
neuronal activity. c-FOS staining in the paraventricular nucleus
(PVN) was increased in mice treated with the combination of
icilin and DMPP, but not in response to either monotherapy
(Fig. 3c). The induction of c-FOS in the PVN following the
combination therapy was absent in nAChR β4 KO mice (Fig. 3d),
suggesting that α3β4 nAChRs are necessary for the anorexigenic
effects of the treatment. In support, DIO nAChR β4 KO mice did
not lose body weight in response to DMPP and icilin cotreatment
(Supplementary Fig. 3h).
The notion that the satiety benefits of the combination
treatment specifically implicate the PVN prompted us to
investigate the role of the leptin–melanocortin system to the
anorexigenic phenotype. We observed a complete loss-of-effect in
DIO melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R) KO mice following
treatment with both the monotherapies and the combination of
icilin and DMPP (Fig. 3e, f), underlining that the melanocortin
pathway is indispensable for the weight-lowering benefits of the
cotreatment.

 Icilin and DMPP stimulate thermogenic pathways. To gain
insight into the mechanisms responsible for the energy expen-
diture induction downstream of the MC4R, we tested the ability
of DMPP and icilin to reverse obesity in mice lacking β-
adrenergic receptors (betaless mice). The weight loss following
icilin and DMPP treatment was significantly blunted in the
betaless mice (Fig. 4a), while food intake was suppressed (Fig. 4b),
indicating the contribution of the adrenergic system to selectively
mediate the effects on energy expenditure. Except for a subtle
increase in brown fat Pgc1a mRNA in response to icilin and the
cotreatment (Supplementary Fig. 5a), brown fat and inguinal
white adipose tissue gene programs of thermogenesis, mito-
chondrial
transport,
creatine
metabolism,
and
proteasomal
activity were unaffected in treated betaless mice (Supplementary
Fig. 5a–h). To assess the role of UCP1-mediated thermogenesis,
we tested the combination of icilin and DMPP in UCP1 KO and
WT mice. The body weight-lowering effect was blunted in UCP1
KO mice (Fig. 4c), while as observed in the betaless mice, food
intake was still suppressed (Fig. 4d). We also confirmed the
necessity of functional TRPM8 for DMPP and icilin-mediated
reductions in body fat and weight (Supplementary Fig. 3b–g).
Using Multi-Spectral Optoacoustic Tomography (MSOT) ima-
ging of the BAT in vivo20, we detected an increase in the
optoacoustic signal intensity over the BAT region following both
icilin and DMPP monotherapy. Coadministration of both mole-
cules resulted in the largest increase (Fig. 4e). Only the combi-
nation of icilin and DMPP increased oxygen saturation of the
delivered blood to the BAT (Fig. 4f–g), emphasizing that the
combination of icilin and DMPP is superior to the monotherapies
in delivering oxygen for metabolic processes in the brown fat.
Collectively, these data underscore that thermogenic pathways
utilizing SNS-driven activation of β-ARs and UCP1 contribute
substantially to the weight-lowering benefits of DMPP and icilin
pharmacology.
Synergistic pharmacology is independent of temperature.
Because mice housed at thermoneutral conditions may more
accurately model drug-induced thermogenesis in humans21,22, we
tested DMPP and icilin cotreatment in DIO mice housed at 30 °C.
Analogous to the effect at room temperature, we found that
treatment of mice acclimated at 30 °C with the combination of
DMPP and icilin synergistically lowered their body weight and fat
mass in comparison with the monotherapies (Fig. 5a, c, d). Unlike
the effect at room temperature, the weight loss of the mice housed
at thermoneutrality was independent of a substantial reduction in
food intake (Fig. 5b). DMPP and icilin monotherapies increased
BAT multilocularity (Fig. 5e) and UCP1 protein (Fig. 5f, g), but
not thermogenic gene programs in BAT (Fig. 5h) or inguinal
white adipose tissue (iWAT) (Supplementary Fig. 6d). The
combination of DMPP and icilin was superior in increasing BAT
multilocularity (Fig. 5e), UCP1 protein levels (Fig. 5f, g), Ucp1
mRNA, and genes involved in mitochondrial transport (Fig. 5h,
i). DMPP monotherapy and its combination with icilin sup-
pressed the expression of Gamt, an enzyme involved in creatine

 synthesis (Fig. 5j). No effects were observed on iWAT beiging
(Supplementary Fig. 6b–c) or thermogenic gene programs in the
iWAT of treated mice (Supplementary Fig. 6d–g). These findings
underscore that the thermogenic complementary effects of dual
TRPM8 and nAChR activation are preserved in DIO mice housed
at thermoneutral conditions.
Icilin and DMPP improve glucose control and fatty liver dis-
ease. Whereas icilin monotherapy has negligible effects on glu-
cose metabolism (Fig. 6a, b, Fig. 7a, Supplementary Fig. 8c),
DMPP alone and in combination with icilin corrected diet-
induced glucose intolerance following 1-weak of treatment
(Fig. 6a, b). The insulin response during the glucose tolerance
test (GTT) was lower following combination treatment relative to
the monotherapies and vehicle control (Fig. 6c, d), implying
enhanced insulin sensitivity. This notion was corroborated by
HOMA-IR assessment (Fig. 6f) and by insulin tolerance tests
(ITT) executed at both ambient room temperature (Fig. 6g) and
at thermoneutral conditions (Fig. 6h) demonstrating superior
effects of DMPP and icilin cotreatment relative to the mono-
therapies on insulin sensitivity. Notably, we observed opposing
effects of icilin monotherapy on insulin sensitivity depending on
the housing temperature. Hepatic glucose output was indirectly
assessed by a pyruvate tolerance test (PTT). The glucose excur-
sion during the PTT was substantially dampened by both icilin
and DMPP treatment relative to vehicle treated HFD mice
(Fig. 6i, j). These long-term glycemic benefits were further
improved when DMPP and icilin were coadministered (Fig. 6i, j).
None of the treatments affected circulating lipoprotein fractions
(Fig. 6k), but both DMPP and icilin monotherapies improved
diet-induced hepatic steatosis (Fig. 6l) and diet-induced NAFLD-
induced NASH at thermoneutral conditions (Fig. 6m, n). The
combination of DMPP and icilin was superior to the mono-
therapies with respect to improving NAFLD and NASH. Several
genes associated with cholesterol and triglyceride uptake, as well
as bile acid metabolism, were altered by the treatments (Supple-
mentary Fig. 7a, b). Notably, Cyp7b1 was highly induced by the
combination of DMPP and icilin (Supplementary Fig. 7a). Plasma
levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate amino-
transferase (AST) were unchanged (Supplementary Fig. 7c, d).
Together, these data underscore that the combination of DMPP
and icilin corrects multiple aspects of the metabolic syndrome
inflicted by excess consumption of dietary fat and sugar.

The
leptin–melanocortin system plays a key role in the central

the central leptin–melanocortin system to improve glycemia,
we used MC4R KO mice. In the DIO MC4R KO mice, neither

 ameliorated glucose intolerance (Fig. 7c, d). UCP1 is required
for sympathetic-induced BAT glucose utilization24. Here, we
found that combination of DMPP and icilin improved diet-
induced glucose intolerance equally in DIO WT and DIO UCP1
KO mice (Fig. 7e–h). The benefits of DMPP and icilin
cotreatment on glucose tolerance were also preserved in
betaless mice (Supplementary Fig. 8a, b) and in TRPM8 KO
mice (Supplementary Fig. 8d, e). Together, these data underline
that both the glycemic and weight-lowering benefits linked to
dual TRPM8 and nAChR α3β4 agonism are centrally mediated
and require key signaling nodes in the leptin–melanocortin
pathway.

 Discussion
Inspired by the efficiency of two canonical environmental mod-
ulators of human energy metabolism—tobacco smoking and cold
exposure—to suppress appetite and increase energy expenditure,
respectively, we here explored a novel pharmacological strategy in
which we aimed to simultaneously mimic the metabolic benefits
of both phenomena through a “biochemical cigarette”. We report
that the small molecule icilin stimulates the cold receptor TRPM8
to elicit thermogenesis and lower body weight without influen-
cing appetite. In parallel, we discovered that the nAChR α3β4
agonist DMPP suppresses appetite and reverses diet-induced
glucose intolerance. Finally, we show that concerted treatment
with icilin and DMPP elicits complementary metabolic benefits to
reverse obesity, glucose intolerance, and hepatic steatosis in
mouse models of obesity and glucose intolerance.
Targeting TRPM8 to increase energy expenditure as a means to
combat obesity has previously been suggested10,19,25–27. Now, by
revealing a potent anti-obesity potential of the TRPM8 agonist
icilin, we add substantial support to this idea. In contrast to
previous studies that report a cell autonomous effect of TRPM8
on adipocyte thermogenesis, we did not detect TRPM8 expression
in adipocytes, nor did we observe any functional effect of icilin on
BAT respiration or UCP1 induction. Conversely, our data pro-
pose that the ability of TRPM8 activity to increase energy
expenditure is indirect—likely implicating sensory neurons and
SNS-induced thermogenesis28. This is supported by the MSOT
data showing a clear physiological phenomenon induced in BAT
by the cotreatment, as well as by the data showing the blunted
weight-lowering efficacy following cotreatment in the betaless
mice. Importantly, the metabolic benefits of DMPP and icilin
cotreatment were preserved under thermoneutral conditions. In
contrast to previous work on pharmacological β-adrenergic sti-
mulation22, we observed that food intake was no longer sup-
pressed following combination therapy at thermoneutrality.
Instead, the synergistic weight loss induced by DMPP and icilin
cotreatment at thermoneutrality was accompanied by a profound
induction of brown fat UCP1 levels. Although it is still debated
what rodent housing temperature most accurately mimics the
human condition29–31, the effectiveness of DMPP and icilin
cotreatment to reverse the metabolic syndrome in DIO mice
housed at both ambient room temperature and at thermo-
neutrality strengthens the translational value of this pharmaco-
logical approach.
The implication of hypothalamic α3β4 nAChR activation to
elicit POMC activity and food intake suppression via the
leptin–melanocortin
system13
encouraged
us
to
investigate
selective agonists for this receptor subtype in a potential combi-
nation therapy with TRPM8 agonists. DMPP is an agonist at the
human α3β432 and is reported to act as a catecholamine and
glucagon secretagogue through ganglionic nAChRs33. We iden-
tified a robust reduction in food intake following DMPP treat-
ment, which was amplified by adjunctive icilin treatment. In
agreement with previous findings showing that weight loss fol-
lowing activation of POMC expressed nAChRs is mediated
through MC4R signaling in the PVN13, we discovered that the
ability of DMPP and icilin cotreatment to lower body weight
requires both functional α3β4 nAChRs and MC4Rs. Whereas the
combination of DMPP and icilin likely converge to drive feeding
via MC4R on PVN neurons, the MC4R-dependent increase in
energy
expenditure
possibly
implicates
MC4Rs
located
elsewhere34,35. Our findings are thus in agreement with a
reported divergence of melanocortin signaling in the control of
food intake and energy expenditure36. The mechanism of how
TRPM8 activation potentiates the anorexigenic mechanisms of
α3β4 nAChR activation requires further study.
The ability of DMPP to lower HFD-linked hyperphagia and
reverse obesity is comparable to that of other nAChR-agonists,
including nicotine as shown here. However, the robust and
weight-independent improvement in glycemic control following
DMPP treatment might be a unique feature relative to other
nAChR agonists. In fact, there is evidence that nicotine worsens
glycemic control37. Recently, it was reported that UCP1 expres-
sion is required for β3-adrenergic receptor (AR)-mediated
improvements in glucose metabolism38. Here, we find that the
ability of DMPP and the combination of DMPP and icilin to
reverse diet-induced glucose intolerance is independent of BAT
UCP1 induction. Notably, while the effects on glucose tolerance
appear to be predominantly driven by DMPP, the addition of
icilin is required to maximize the benefits on insulin sensitivity.
Supporting that mechanisms proximate to brown fat are driving
the improvements in glucose metabolism, the potent glycemic
benefits governed by DMPP pharmacology were completely lost
in MC4R KO mice. However, mouse models of monogenetic
obesity and diabetes exhibit a severe background phenotype, so
the lack of pharmacological efficacy must be interpreted with
caution. Thus, future studies are required to illuminate the
molecular interplay between MC4R and α3β4 nAChR signaling in
glucose control and for example if MC4Rs on cholinergic sym-
pathetic preganglionic neurons are implicated in the glycemic
benefits of α3β4 nAChR agonists39.
It is well established that nicotine affects energy metabolism in
humans40. However, behavioral and cardiovascular off-target
effects compromise the utilization of nAChR-based anti-obesity
pharmacotherapies. Insights into the tissue-specific and func-
tional differences of distinct nicotinic receptor subtypes might
provide important clues for future optimization of nAChR-
targeting compounds. As of today, the study of TRP-channel
pharmacology in relation to human energy expenditure has
mostly focused on TRPV141–44 whereas the effects of potent
TRPM8 targeting pharmacology on human energy expenditure
are largely unexplored. One study suggested that a combined
targeting of TRPM8 and TRPA1 might be required to relevantly
increase human energy expenditure45. In parallel with assessing
the translational value of co-targeting nAChRs and TRPM8,
understanding the underlying mechanisms of actions are vital for

 BAT-liver axis46. Notably, the combination of DMPP and icilin
potently increases hepatic Cyp7b1 expression, leaving the exciting
opportunity that cold-mimicking effects on hepatic bile acid
alterations contribute to the metabolic benefits of the combina-
tion therapy.
In summary, we report that stimulation of TRPM8 represents a
novel strategy to pharmacologically mimic the benefits of cold
exposure on energy metabolism. The ability of the potent TRPM8
agonist icilin to induce a negative energy state is substantially
potentiated by coordinated activation of nAChRs by DMPP. The
combination of DMPP and icilin engages central satiety circuits
and increases BAT thermogenesis, which ultimately improves
diet-induced obesity, glucose intolerance, and hepatic steatosis in
mice. Conclusively, these data support the compelling potential in
coordinated targeting of TRPM8 and α3β4-nAChRs for the
treatment of the related epidemics of obesity, type 2 diabetes, and
fatty liver disease.

 Methods
Animals. For pharmacology studies, six- to eight-week-old male C57Bl6j mice
were provided ad libitum access to a high-fat, high sucrose diet (D12331; Research
Diets, New Brunswick, NJ, USA). The mice had free access to water and were
maintained at 23 °C, with constant humidity and on a 12-h light–dark cycle. All
mice were housed under specific-pathogen-free (SPF) conditions. Mice were
maintained under these conditions for a minimum of 11 weeks before treatment
initiation. For the thermoneutral study, mice were maintained at constant 30 °C
ambient temperature for four to 7 weeks prior to study initiation. CHRNB4 KO
mice were generated as described previously47. Homozygous mice were used to
generate a colony of mice for pharmacological studies. UCP1 KO and MC4R KO
were originally provided from Jackson Laboratory (strain names: B6.129-
Ucp1tm1Kz/J; B6;129S4-Mc4rtm1Lowl/J, ME, USA). TRPM8 KO mice were gen-
erated as described48 and provided from Jackson Laboratory (strain name:
B6.129P2-Trpm8tm1Jul/J). For pharmacological studies, homozygous mice were
used to generate the colony of homozygous WT and TRPM8 KO mice. Betaless
mice were generated as described previously49. Homozygous mice were used to
generate a colony of mice for pharmacological studies. Mice were randomly
assigned to pharmacological treatment groups based on body weight and body fat.
The Animal studies were approved and conducted in accordance to the Danish
Animal Experimentation Inspectorate and Animal Ethics Committee of the gov-
ernment of Upper Bavaria, Germany.
In vivo pharmacology and energy metabolism studies. Compounds were
administered in a vehicle of 0.01 N NaOH and 1% Tween-80 and injected sub-
cutaneously (s.c.) 0–2 h before the onset of the dark cycle at the indicated doses at a
volume of 5 μl per g body weight. Coadministration of compounds was performed
by single formulated injections. Researchers were not blinded to the treatment
groups. Body composition (fat and lean mass) was analyzed using a magnetic
resonance whole-body composition analyzer (Echo-MRI, Houston, TX, USA).
Energy expenditure and home-cage locomotor activity were registered with a
combined indirect calorimetry system (TSE PhenoMaster, TSE Systems, Bad
Homburg, Germany). After 24 h of acclimatization, O2 consumption and CO2

 production were registered every 10 min for a total of 72 h to assess energy
expenditure after daily s.c. administration of the indicated treatments. The mul-
tidimensional infrared light beam system determines home-cage locomotor activity
with beams scanning the bottom and top levels of the cage resulting in activity
expressed as beam breaks.
Glucose metabolism studies. Glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity, and pyruvate
tolerance were analyzed approximately 20 h after the last compound injections. For
glucose and insulin tolerance tests, mice were fasted for 6 h and then challenged by
an intraperitoneal injection of 1.5 g or 1.75 g glucose per kg body weight or 0.75 U
insulin per kg body weight. Pyruvate tolerance was tested in overnight fasted mice
at a dose of 1 g pyruvate per kg body weight. Glucose levels in all tolerance tests
were measured in the blood sampled from the tail veins before (0 min) and at 15,
30, 60, and 120 min post injection using a handheld glucometer (Abbott, Wies-
baden, Germany). To measure glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, blood was
collected from tail veins into EDTA-coated microvette tubes (Sarstedt, Nümbrecht,
Germany) at time points 0, 15 and 60 min post glucose injection.
Blood parameters. Blood was immediately kept on ice, centrifuged at 3000 g and
4 °C, and plasma was stored at −80 °C. Commercially available kits were used to
measure plasma levels of insulin (ALPCO Diagnostics, Salem, NH, USA), ALT, and
AST (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Erlangen, Germany) according to the manu-
facturers’ instructions. For fast performance liquid chromatography of cholesterol
distribution in different lipoprotein fractions, plasma of the different treatment
groups was pooled (n = 7) and measured on two Superose 6 columns connected in
series50.
Biochemical analysis. Mice were euthanized using CO2 after a timed adminis-
tration of compound and removal of food 2 h prior to the sacrifice. Tissue samples
were collected and immediately snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen or kept on dry ice.
For gene expression analysis, RNA was isolated using RNeasy Kit (Qiagen, Hilden,
Germany) according to the manufacturers’ instructions. Total RNA was reverse
transcribed into cDNA using QuantiTect Reverse Transcription Kit (Qiagen,
Hilden, Germany), which includes a gDNA elimination step. Gene expression in
BAT, iWAT, and liver was profiled with quantitative real-time PCR using either
TaqMan single probes or SYBR green (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Erlangen, Ger-
many). The relative expression of the selected genes was normalized to the refer-
ence genes peptidylprolyl isomerase B (Ppib) or hypoxanthine-guanine
phosphoribosyltransferase (Hprt). Data on gene expression were screened for
singular statistically significant outliers using the maximum normed residual
(Grubb’s) test. Sequences of primers and TaqMan probes used are listed in
alphabetical order in Supplementary tables 1, 2.
cFOS immunohistochemistry. For cFOS immunohistochemistry, DIO WT mice
or DIO CHRNB4 KO mice were treated with compounds for 3 days. 2 h prior to
perfusion, food was removed and mice received a final compound treatment. Mice
were sacrificed with CO2 and transcardially perfused with saline (0.9% NaCl)
followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in phosphate buffered saline (pH = 7.4).
Brains were isolated and post-fixed in 4% PFA at 4 °C before being equilibrated for
48 h with 30% sucrose in Tris-buffered saline (TBS; pH 7.2). After sectioning into
30 μm coronal sections using a cryostat, brain slices were washed in TBS and
incubated overnight at 4 °C with a primary antibody anti-cFOS (rabbit polyclonal
SC-52, 1:1000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc, TX, USA) in a solution containing
0.25% gelatin and 0.5% TritonX-100 in TBS. After serial washes in TBS, sections
were incubated with Alexa Fluor 568 donkey-anti-rabbit (1:1000, Molecular
Probes, Life Technologies GmbH, Darmstadt, Germany) secondary antibody.
Sections were serially washed with TBS, mounted on gelatin-pre-coated glass slides,
and cover-slipped for image quantification. Quantification of cFOS immunor-
eactive (cFos+) cells was performed using ImageJ software. Images of single focal
planes were captured at 20X magnification by a BZ-9000 fluorescence microscope
(Keyence Corporation Itasca, IL, USA). The number of cFos+ nuclei within the
PVN was determined according to the Allen mouse brain atlas. All morphometric
analyses were performed without previous knowledge of the experimental group.
Histopathology. After chronic treatment mice were sacrificed with CO2. Formalin
fixed BAT, iWAT, and liver samples were embedded in paraffin using a vacuum
infiltration processor TissueTEK VIP (Sakura, AV Alphen aan den Rijn, Nether-
lands). 3 µm thick slides were cut using a HMS35 (Zeiss, Jena, Germany) or
HM340E (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Erlangen, Germany) rotatory microtome and
H & E staining was performed. For H&E staining, rehydration was done in a
decreasing ethanol series, rinsing with tapwater, 2 min Mayers acid Hemalum,
bluing in tapwater followed by 1 min EosinY (both Sigma-Aldrich, MO, USA).
Dehydration was performed in increasing ethanol series, mounting with Pertex®
(Medite GmbH, Burgdorf, Germany) and coverslips (Carl Roth Chemicals,
Karlsruhe, Germany). The slides were evaluated independently using a brightfield
microscope (Axioplan; Zeiss, Jena, Germany). The hepatic steatosis score is defined
as the unweighted sum of the three individual scores for steatosis, lobular
inflammation, and ballooning degeneration. Steatosis is graded by the presence of
fat vacuoles in liver cells according to the percentage of affected tissue (0: < 5%; 1:
5–33%; 2: 33–66%; 3: > 66%). Lobular inflammation is scored by overall assessment
of inflammatory foci per 200x field (0: no foci; 1: < 2 foci; 2: 2–4 foci; 3: > 4 foci).
The individual score for ballooning degeneration ranges from 0 (none), 1 (few
cells) to 2 (many cells). Total scores range from 0 to 8 with scores < 2 considered
non-steatosis, 3 considered as borderline steatosis, 4–5 considered onset of stea-
tosis, and > 6 considered steatosis.
For UCP1 immunoreactivity, 3 µm sections of iWAT and BAT samples were
stained on a Discovery XT automated stainer (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim,
Germany) employing rabbit anti-UCP1 antibody (1:1500; ab 10983, Abcam,
Cambridge, UK). Signal detection was performed using biotinylated goat anti-
rabbit (1:750, BA-1000, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA) as a secondary
antibody and Dako detection kit (K5001; Agilent, Waldbronn, Germany). The
stained tissue sections were scanned with an AxioScan.Z1 digital slide scanner
(Zeiss, Jena, Germany) equipped with a 20x magnification objective.
Images were evaluated using the commercially available image analysis software
Definiens Developer XD 2 (Definiens AG, Munich, Germany). A specific ruleset
was developed in order to detect and quantify UCP1 stained tissue. The calculated
parameter was the ratio of UCP1 stained tissue.
Isolation of primary brown adipocytes. Primary brown adipocytes were isolated
from six- to eight-week-old male C57Bl6j mice. The brown adipose tissue was
minced and digested at 37 °C for 40 min (1 mg/ml Collagenase II (Thermo Fisher
Scientific, Erlangen, Germany), 3 U/ml Dispase II (Sigma-Aldrich, Munich, Ger-
many), 0.01 mM CaCl2 in PBS). The cell suspension was filtered using a 100 µm
cell strainer, centrifuged and resuspended in growth medium (DMEM/F12 1:1 plus
Glutamax (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Erlangen, Germany) containing 1% penicillin/
streptomycin (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Erlangen, Germany) and 10% heat-
inactivated FBS). After a second filtration step (40 µm cell strainer), pre-adipocytes
were cultured to confluency in collagen-coated 12-well plates (VWR International
GmbH, Darmstadt, Germany) (37 °C, 5% CO2). Differentiation was induced with
dexamethasone (5 µM), isobutyl-methylxanthine (0.5 mM), rosiglitazone (1 µM),
indomethacin (125 µM), T3 (1 nM), and insulin (0.5 µg/ml) in growth medium.
After 2 days of induction, adipocytes were cultured in growth medium containing
rosiglitazone, T3, and insulin and at day 4 of differentiation, cells were grown in
growth medium with T3 and insulin.
The study involving adipocytes derived from human BAT biopsies was
reviewed and approved by the ethics committee of Maastricht University Medical
Center (METC 10-3-012, NL31367.068.10, NCT03111719). Informed participant
consent was obtained prior to surgery and all ethical regulations were followed.
Human BAT cultures were generated similarly to previous work51. In short, the
stromal vascular fraction was obtained from BAT from an individual undergoing
deep neck surgery. Differentiation was initiated for 7 days via differentiation
medium made up out of biotin (33 mM), pantothenate (17 mM), insulin (100 nM),
dexamethasone (100 nM), IBMX (250 mM), rosiglitazone (5 mM), T3 (2 nM), and
transferrin (10 mg/ml). Cells were transferred maintenance medium consisting of
biotin (33 mM), pantothenate (17 mM), insulin (100 nM), dexamethasone (10 nM),
T3 (2 nM), and transferrin (10 mg/ml) for another 5 days.
Primary brown adipocytes, gene expression. For gene expression analysis in
differentiated primary brown adipocytes, cells were treated with isoproterenol
(Sigma-Aldrich, Munich, Germany, 1 µM), icilin (1 and 10 µM) or control (0.1%
DMSO) at day 6 of differentiation for 6 h in serum-free growth medium. Medium
was removed and the cell plates were snap-frozen at −80 °C until RNA isolation.
Bioenergetics analysis. Primary brown adipocytes were cultured and differ-
entiated on a XF96e-well plate. At day 5 of differentiation, cells were washed and
incubated in DMEM XF Assay medium (Seahorse Bioscience, Santa Clara, CA,
USA), supplemented with 25 mM glucose (Carl Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany) and
1.5% fatty acid free-BSA (Sigma-Aldrich, Munich, Germany) at 37 °C in a non-CO2
incubator for 10 min. Tenfold higher concentrated compounds, dissolved in
DMEM XF Assay medium without supplements, were loaded into the ports of a XF
Assay Cartridge. Oxygen consumption rate (OCR) was measured using an extra-
cellular flux analyzer (XF96, Seahorse Bioscience, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Basal
OCR was recorded for 9 min, followed by measurement of OCR after injection of
oligomycin (2 µg/ml, 23 min), norepinephrine (1 µM, 27 min), icilin (1 µM, 27 min)
or control (0.1% DMSO, 27 min), carbonyl cyanide-p-
trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP) (1 µM, 14 min), rotenone (2.5 µM)/
antimycin A (2.5 µM)/2-deoxyglucose (10 mM) (9 min). For normalization, the cell
plate was fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and subsequently co-stained with 4′,6-
diamidino-2-phenylindole (Dapi) and Nile red. Using a PheraStar plate reader, the
fluorescence signal was detected and the bioenergetics measurements were cor-
rected for cell number and differentiation.
Multi-spectral Optoacoustic Tomography. Multi-spectral Optoacoustic Tomo-
graphy (MSOT) measurements were conducted with a 256-channel real-time
imaging MSOT scanner52 (inVision 256-TF, iThera Medical GmbH, Munich,
Germany) equipped with a tunable (wavelength range: 680–960 nm) pulsed (pulse
duration: < 10 ns) optical parametric oscillator laser with a 10 Hz repetition rate. A
fiber bundle was used for delivering homogeneous light along a line of illumination

 surrounding the animal body. Optoacoustic signals were acquired by a 256-ele-
ment, cylindrically focused transducer array covering a solid angle of 270° around
the imaged animal. The individual detector elements had a central frequency of 5
MHz. The system can acquire cross-sectional (transverse) images of oxygenated
and deoxygenated hemoglobin over time. Processing of these images can yield
maps of total blood volume, tissue oxygen saturation, and of their transients. A
moving stage enables the imaging of different transverse planes, while the illumi-
nation and ultrasound detection components remain static.
Mouse MSOT measurements in vivo. C57Bl6j mice (Charles River Laboratories
Inc, Charleston, USA) were anesthetized by i.p. injection of 139 mg/kg ketamine
and 6.8 mg/kg xylazine and placed in the MSOT sample holder as described ear-
lier53. In brief, each animal was placed onto a thin, polyethylene membrane and
positioned in the water bath maintained at 34 °C. Temperature controlled water
provided acoustic coupling and maintained animal temperature while imaging. For
imaging brown adipose tissue, vehicle, DMPP, icilin or the combination of DMPP
and icilin were injected i.p. 40 min before imaging. A total of six animals were used
for the activation experiments. For each measurement, multiple images at 10 dif-
ferent wavelengths spanning 700 nm to 900 nm with 20-nm steps were recorded.
Preliminary data processing was performed using the commercial suite provided by
the manufacturing company (ViewMSOT, Xvue Ltd, Greece). Finally, a model-
based image reconstruction method was applied on the raw optoacoustic signals,
followed by a spectral unmixing step to calculate the saturation maps over selected
regions of interest. Eigenspectra optoacoustic tomography achieves quantitative
blood oxygenation imaging deep in tissues54.
Statistics. Statistical analyses were performed on data distributed in a normal
pattern using one- or two-way ANOVA followed by Tukey post-hoc analysis as
appropriate or an unpaired two-tailed Student’s t test. No statistical methods were
used to predetermine sample size for in vivo pharmacology studies. Mean energy
expenditure was analyzed using ANCOVA with body weight as covariate as pre-
viously suggested55. All results are presented as mean ± SEM, and P < 0.05 was
considered significant.
