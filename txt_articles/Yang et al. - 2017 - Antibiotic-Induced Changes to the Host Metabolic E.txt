SUMMARY
Bactericidal antibiotics alter microbial metabolism as part of their lethality and can damage 
mitochondria in mammalian cells. In addition, antibiotic susceptibility is sensitive to extracellular 
metabolites, but it remains unknown if metabolites present at an infection site can affect either 
treatment efficacy or immune function. Here, we quantify local metabolic changes in the host 
microenvironment following antibiotic treatment for a peritoneal Escherichia coli infection. 
Antibiotic treatment elicits microbiome-independent changes in local metabolites but not those 
distal to the infection site by acting directly on host cells. The metabolites induced during 
treatment, such as AMP, reduce antibiotic efficacy and enhance phagocytic killing. Moreover, 
antibiotic treatment impairs immune function by inhibiting respiratory activity in immune cells. 
Collectively, these results highlight the immunomodulatory potential of antibiotics and reveal the 
local metabolic microenvironment to be an important determinant of infection resolution.

 Antibiotic susceptibility is sensitive to metabolites but how this impacts in vivo treatment efficacy 
remains unexplored. Yang and Bhargava et al. characterize antibiotic-induced changes to the

induce metabolites that alter drug efficacy and impair phagocytic activity.

INTRODUCTION
Although the mechanisms of action for most conventional antibiotics have been well studied 
(Kohanski et al., 2010), the effects of antibiotic treatment on human physiology and host-
microbe interactions are only beginning to become understood (Willing et al., 2011). 
Antibiotics have been observed to alter immune responses (Anuforom et al., 2015) and there 
is growing appreciation that non-specific actions by antibiotics may promote disease by 
creating favorable niches for opportunistic pathogens (Theriot et al., 2014). In light of the 
pressing challenges of antibiotic resistance and the diminishing drug discovery pipeline 
(Brown and Wright, 2016), there is an urgent need to better understand the complex 
consequences of antibiotic treatment during infection.
We have previously shown that bacterial metabolism participates in the efficacy of 
bactericidal antibiotics (Belenky et al., 2015; Dwyer et al., 2014; Lobritz et al., 2015) and 
that antibiotic susceptibility is sensitive to extracellular metabolites (Allison et al., 2011; 
Meylan et al., 2017). During infection, bacterial pathogens dynamically remodel their 
metabolic environment by inducing host catabolism, disrupting metabolic balance and 
altering the abundance of energy metabolites, amino acids and lipids (Beisel, 1975; Dong et 
al., 2012). However, it remains unknown how local changes to the metabolic 
microenvironment might also alter antibiotic efficacy during treatment.

 Here, we sought to determine if antibiotic treatment alters the host metabolic 
microenvironment and if such changes alter antibiotic susceptibility or immune function. We 
performed targeted metabolomics on samples from mice receiving oral antibiotics for a 
peritoneal infection and found that antibiotics treatment systemically alters metabolites in 
the host, depleting central metabolism intermediates in the peritoneum. We show that these 
changes are microbiome-independent as they also occur in germ-free mice. Additionally, we 
demonstrate that metabolites altered by antibiotic treatment during infection may inhibit 
antibiotic efficacy and potentiate the phagocytic activity of immune cells. Moreover, we 
show that antibiotics directly inhibit respiratory activity in immune cells and can 
consequently impair their phagocytic activity. Together, these results indicate that antibiotic-
induced changes to host metabolites and metabolic processes can significantly impact both 
treatment efficacy and immune function.
RESULTS
Antibiotic treatment depletes central metabolism intermediates in the peritoneum
In order to determine if antibiotics alter metabolites in the host environment, we quantified 
metabolites in samples from mice receiving antibiotic treatment, bacterial infection or their 
combination. We subjected a cohort of 8-week old C57BL/6J mice to a set of perturbations 
including antibiotic treatment with 100 μg/mL ciprofloxacin (cipro) delivered in the drinking 
water (ABX), intraperitoneal infection by Escherichia coli ATCC25922 (INF), or their 
combination (COMB) (Figure 1A). After 24 h, mice were sacrificed and samples from three 
tissues were collected for metabolomic profiling: (a) the peritoneum, to characterize changes 
in metabolites local to infection; (b) plasma, to characterize global changes in circulating 
metabolites; and (c) the lung, to characterize changes in metabolites distal to infection. We 
performed targeted LC-MS/MS on these samples (McCloskey et al., 2015), enabling 
absolute quantification for nearly 80 metabolites supporting bacterial growth, including 
amino acids, nucleotides and central metabolism intermediates (Table S1).
Hierarchical clustering of these measurements revealed that the metabolomic profiles 
clustered first by tissue, then by perturbation (Figure 1B), indicating that the metabolic 
changes elicited by antibiotic treatment or infection were local and tissue specific. 
Unsupervised principal component analysis (PCA) revealed that antibiotic treatment 
systemically altered metabolites in the host environment as samples from ABX mice 
clustered away from control (CTL) samples in all three tissues (Figure 1C, S1A, S1B). In 
contrast, infection only exerted local changes, eliciting significant changes in metabolites in 
the peritoneum (Figure 1C), but not in the plasma (Figure S1A) or lung (Figure S1B).
In order to better understand the antibiotic-induced changes in the infection 
microenvironment, we performed multivariate analysis on the peritoneal samples to identify 
a metabolite signature corresponding to antibiotic treatment. We applied elastic net 
regularization and partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) and identified a 
feature set of metabolites that could discriminate the ABX samples from the union of CTL 
and INF samples (Ballabio and Consonni, 2013). This yielded 14 metabolites sufficient for 
explaining 71% of the variance in metabolites and 40% of the variance in treatments with 
100% calibration accuracy and 100% cross-validation accuracy (Figure 1D). PLS-DA

 predicted that antibiotic-associated metabolic changes were most strongly characterized by 
depletion in uridine diphosphate (udp), glucose-6-phosphate (g6p) and ribulose-5-phosphate 
(ru5p) (Figure 1E). By inspection, many of these metabolites are intermediates in the 
pentose phosphate pathway, glycolysis and fatty acid biosynthesis. We performed metabolite 
set enrichment analysis (MSEA) on these metabolites and found enrichment for 
“carbohydrate biosynthesis” (p = 6.47e–4) (Table S2).
Performing a similar analysis on the plasma and lung samples, we found different metabolite 
signatures associated with each tissue (Figure S1C, S1D). While MSEA identified lung 
metabolites as enriched for “generation of precursor metabolites and energy” (p = 3.46e–3) 
(Table S3), plasma metabolites were not specifically enriched for any metabolic pathways 
with FDR-corrected p-values below significance (p = 0.05). We metabolomically profiled 
additional mice treated with a higher concentration of cipro (Figure S2A) and found that 400 
μg/mL cipro mostly amplified the antibiotic-induced changes to host metabolites that we had 
observed at 100 μg/mL cipro in the peritoneum (Figure S2B, S2C) and plasma (Figure S2B, 
S2D), indicated by a further projection along the first principal component. Together, these 
data indicate that antibiotic treatment exerts tissue-specific changes in metabolites in the 
host environment.
Antibiotic treatment elicits microbiome-independent changes in host metabolites
Antibiotics are thought to systemically alter metabolites in the host environment by acting 
on the gut microbiome (Reijnders et al., 2016), but the tissue-specific changes we observed 
suggested that antibiotics may instead act locally and directly on host cells. To test this 
hypothesis, we profiled metabolites from germ-free mice treated with 100 μg/mL cipro 
delivered in the drinking water (Figure 2A). Surprisingly, we found that many of the tissue-
specific changes in metabolites from the conventional (CONV) mice also occurred in the 
germ-free (GF) mice lacking a microbiome (Figure 2B).
In order to better understand if the antibiotic-induced changes to local metabolites in the 
CONV mice were due to direct effects on host cells versus effects on the microbiome, we 
performed PCA on CTL and ABX samples from both the CONV and GF mice for each 
tissue. PCA orthogonally clustered the peritoneal samples into four distinct quadrants along 
two principal components that captured 74% of the variance and appeared to directly 
correspond to either presence of a microbiome (PC 1) or of antibiotic treatment (PC 2) 
(Figure 2C). Moreover, inspection of metabolites with the greatest PLS-DA loadings in the 
peritoneal ABX signature revealed similar fold-changes in both CONV and GF mice, 
despite differences in the untreated CTL concentrations. PCA on the plasma samples 
similarly revealed that 83% of the variance in plasma metabolites could be explained by 
direct effects on host cells instead of effects on the microbiome (Figure 2D). In contrast, the 
lung samples did not separate as cleanly along principal components corresponding to a 
microbiome and antibiotic treatment (Figure S3). Together, these data indicate that most of 
the antibiotic-induced changes in metabolites are microbiome-independent and likely due to 
direct actions of antibiotics on local host cells.

 Antibiotic treatment elicits unique metabolic changes in the presence of infection
Because antibiotics are administered to treat infection, we sought to characterize metabolic 
changes that occur in the presence of infection. We first identified an infection-specific 
metabolic signature by multivariate analysis and then tested if the complex changes observed 
under combination treatment could be explained by the ABX and INF signatures. We 
performed elastic net regularization and used PLS-DA to discriminate the INF samples from 
the union of CTL and ABX samples, identifying a feature set of nine metabolites sufficient 
for explaining 90% of the variance in metabolites and 44% of the variance in treatments with 
100% calibration accuracy and 100% cross-validation accuracy (Figure 3A). These were 
most strongly characterized by enrichment in guanosine monophosphate (gmp) and 
depletion in adenosine (adn) and adenosine monophosphate (amp) (Figure 3B). MSEA 
revealed that these were specifically enriched for purine metabolic pathways, including 
terms such as “purine nucleotide degradation” (p=1.42e–6) and “purine nucleotide 
biosynthesis” (p=1.96e–6) (Table S4). Because purine metabolites can function as important 
immune signaling molecules (Cekic and Linden, 2016), these data suggest that the INF 
metabolite signature indicated a local induction of host immunity.
PLS-DA of the peritoneal samples from all four treatment groups onto the union of 
metabolites from the ABX and INF signatures revealed that antibiotic treatment and 
infection formed two orthogonal dimensions describing the infection microenvironment with 
88% calibration accuracy and 83% cross-validation accuracy (Figure 3C), in close 
agreement to the unsupervised PCA of these samples (Figure 1C). This was supported by the 
observation that udp, g6p and ru5p under combination treatment trended similarly to 
antibiotic treatment and gmp and adn trended similarly to infection (Figure 3B). 
Collectively, these results suggest that most of the local changes in host metabolites 
associated with antibiotic treatment of infection could be explained by the independent 
actions of either antibiotic treatment or infection.
Interestingly, not all of the metabolite changes in the COMB samples could be explained by 
the independent actions of antibiotics or infection. For instance, amp was significantly 
enriched in the COMB samples despite being depleted in the INF samples and unchanged in 
the ABX samples (Figure 3B). We subjected additional mice to both infection and antibiotic 
treatment and sampled the peritoneum at earlier time points. We found that amp 
concentrations peaked at ~3-fold six hours after infection (Figure S4). COMB samples also 
scored higher on the antibiotic axis (LV 2) than the ABX samples, suggesting infection may 
potentiate the metabolic changes elicited by antibiotic treatment (Figure 3C). To test this, we 
performed elastic net regularization and used PLS-DA to identify a COMB-specific 
metabolite signature discriminating the COMB samples from the union of CTL, ABX and 
INF samples. This was comprised of 20 metabolites sufficient for explaining 55% of the 
variance in metabolites and 35% of the variance in treatments with 100% calibration 
accuracy and 96% cross-validation accuracy (Figure 3D). PLS-DA predicted that this 
signature was enriched for thymine (thym) and amp and depleted in 3-phospho-D-glyceroyl 
phosphate (23dpg) and guanosine (gsn) (Figure 3E, 3B). MSEA revealed these to be 
enriched in diverse metabolic processes, including various nucleotide, energy and amino 
acid metabolism pathways (Table S5).

 Metabolites altered by antibiotic treatment during infection inhibit drug efficacy
Antibiotic efficacy is sensitive to the abundance of extracellular metabolites (Allison et al., 
2011; Meylan et al., 2017). We hypothesized that host metabolites induced by antibiotic 
treatment of infection might feedback on drug susceptibility in the pathogen. To test this 
hypothesis, we quantified the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of cipro in E. coli 
cells following 10 mM supplementation with thym or amp, which was ~13 ng/mL without 
supplementation. While thym supplementation did not appear to alter the MIC (~13.5 ng/
mL), amp supplementation significantly decreased cipro susceptibility, increasing the MIC 
to ~100 ng/mL (Figure 4A). Time-kill experiments with 25 ng/mL cipro revealed that amp 
supplementation elicited dose-dependent protection (Figure 4B).
We further characterized changes in MIC promoted by supplementation with metabolites 
from the COMB, ABX or INF signatures and found that many of these metabolites also 
inhibited drug susceptibility (Figure 4A, 4C, 4D). MSEA on these metabolites identified 
“amines and polyamines biosynthesis” as the metabolic pathway most enriched by these 
metabolites (p=3.99e–4) (Table S6). Together, these results demonstrate that host 
metabolites induced by antibiotics during treatment of infection can feedback and impact 
antibiotic efficacy.
Direct actions of antibiotic treatment on immune cells inhibit phagocytic killing
Bactericidal antibiotics can impair mitochondrial function in epithelial cells and inhibit their 
respiratory activity (Kalghatgi et al., 2013). In addition, metabolites present in the host 
microenvironment may initiate signaling cascades in immune cells that lead to metabolic 
reprogramming and functional changes (O’Neill and Hardie, 2013). Because efficient 
phagocytosis involves induction of a highly energy-dependent respiratory burst (Murphy and 
Weaver, 2016), we sought to determine if antibiotic treatment might also interfere with the 
respiratory activity of immune cells. We pre-treated mouse macrophages with cipro and 
measured changes in oxygen consumption following electron transport chain uncoupling 
(Figure 5A). These data revealed a dose-dependent inhibition of respiratory capacity (Figure 
5B).
We hypothesized that antibiotic-induced impairments in respiration and/or the induction of 
local metabolites might physiologically alter the phagocytic activity of immune cells 
recruited to a site of infection. To test this hypothesis, we enumerated E. coli cells attached 
or killed by macrophages following treatment with cipro and/or amp. Compared with 
untreated cells, macrophages pretreated with 20 μg/mL cipro for 3 h (ABX) engulfed fewer 
E. coli cells (Figure 5C, S5A) and possessed more surviving cells following lysis of the 
macrophages (Figure 5D, S5B), indicating a significant decrease in the killing of engulfed 
cells (Figure 5E). In contrast, we found that 10 mM amp significantly increased pathogen 
engulfment (Figure 5C, S5C) and decreased pathogen survival (Figure 5D, S5D), indicating 
that metabolites induced at the site of infection by antibiotics may feed-forward and 
potentiate immune function. Interestingly, antibiotic treatment exerted a dominant negative 
effect over the metabolic potentiation in macrophages subjected to both cipro and amp 
(ABX+amp), most prominently in the ability to engulf pathogens. Collectively, these results

 indicate that antibiotic treatment can directly act on immune cells and metabolically impair 
their function.
DISCUSSION
Infections are complex host-microbe interfaces comprised of multiple species, cell types and 
biochemical species. While local metabolism is understood to be important for pathogens to 
establish their niche, the contribution of antibiotics to this environment is poorly understood. 
Here, we investigated the effects of antibiotic treatment on host metabolism in a commonly 
used and well-defined model of in vivo infection. While antibiotics normally act in concert 
with host immune cells to remove pathogens at a site of infection, we report that antibiotics 
also act synergistically with pathogen cells to remodel the local metabolic environment 
(Figure 6). We demonstrate that metabolites induced in this environment have the capacity to 
affect both antibiotic efficacy and immune function and that the direct consequences of 
antibiotics on the metabolism of immune cells can inhibit their phagocytic activity. These 
data highlight the complex interactions elicited by antibiotics at the site of infection and 
support prior in vitro studies demonstrating that the host metabolic environment is critical 
for the function of both antibiotics (Yang et al., 2017) and immune cells (Buck et al., 2017).
Antibiotics are thought to systemically alter metabolites in the host by manipulating gut 
microbiome taxonomy (Reijnders et al., 2016). We report that orally administered antibiotics 
also induce dose-dependent and microbiome-independent changes in metabolites in the host 
environment. Of significance, we find that most of the metabolic variation observed in 
conventionally raised mice also appeared in germ-free mice in both the plasma and 
peritoneum. These results are consistent with our previous observations that bactericidal 
antibiotics directly induce mitochondrial dysfunction in mammalian cells (Kalghatgi et al., 
2013) and our present observations that antibiotics can inhibit the phagocytic activity of 
immune cells, which require a functioning respiratory chain for their bactericidal oxidative 
burst. In our in vitro experiments, these effects appeared to occur at concentrations ≥ 1 
μg/mL, well within the pharmacokinetic range of 1–5 μg/mL achieved in human serum 
following oral delivery and ≥ 10 μg/mL in other tissues following intravenous delivery 
(Vance-Bryan et al., 1990).
Nutrient availability at a site of infection is an important regulator of antibiotic susceptibility 
(Amato et al., 2014) and previous studies have demonstrated that antibiotic tolerance may be 
overcome metabolically by stimulating bacterial central metabolism (Allison et al., 2011; 
Meylan et al., 2017). We report that diverse metabolites induced by antibiotics at the site of 
infection also have potential to alter both antibiotic efficacy and immune function. An 
example of this is in the synergistic and local induction of amp, an energy currency 
precursor and a participant in purine metabolism that exerts immunomodulation through 
AMP-activated protein kinase (O’Neill and Hardie, 2013). We find that amp alters E. coli 
sensitivity to cipro and enhances phagocytic killing by macrophages. Although the amp 
concentrations that we measured from our bulk lavage of the peritoneum (~10–50 μM) did 
not exceed the ≥ 100 μM required to elicit an effect on either antibiotic efficacy or immune 
function, it is possible that amp concentrations were higher in regional peritoneal 
microdomains due to the large surface area and complex geometry of the peritoneum.

 Moreover, amp concentrations are generally ~200 μM in mammalian tissues (Traut, 1994) 
and can increase > 100-fold in human tissues following metabolically demanding activities 
such as exercise (Harkness et al., 1983). Amp therefore may have more significant effects in 
other tissues or other in vivo infection models.
While here we use amp to exemplify a single form of complex metabolic cross-talk between 
host and microbe physiology in the context of infection, other metabolites altered at a site of 
infection likely also significantly impact antibiotic efficacy or immune function through 
undiscovered mechanisms. MSEA identified polyamine biosynthesis as a metabolic process 
enriched by the protective metabolites from our metabolite screens. Interestingly, several 
studies demonstrate that polyamines can protect pathogens against antibiotic treatment 
(Kwon and Lu, 2006), by inhibiting drug uptake (Sarathy et al., 2013), inducing protective 
stress responses (Tkachenko et al., 2006), and reducing antibiotic-induced reactive oxygen 
species (Tkachenko et al., 2012). Future studies will need to clarify the mechanisms by 
which diverse metabolites may alter antibiotic efficacy (Yang et al., 2017).
Finally, our work identifies the local metabolic microenvironment as an important 
determinant in the resolution of infection, due to its actions on antibiotic susceptibility and 
immune function. It is likely that interpersonal differences in the combination of such 
metabolites may contribute to variable treatment outcomes across patients suffering from 
similar infections (Lee and Collins, 2011). Additionally, dynamic changes to these 
environments, for instance by prophylactics, may be useful for maximizing both antibiotic 
efficacy and immune function. As recognition of metabolic context-dependence for 
antibiotic efficacy is growing for important human pathogens (Black et al., 2014), our 
findings support the use of metabolic adjuvants to enhance our existing antibiotic arsenal 
(Wright, 2016).

Experimental Model and Subject Details
Bacterial Strains, Media, Growth Conditions—Escherichia coli strain ATCC25922 
was purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and used for all 
experiments in this study. Cells were cultured in tryptic soy broth (TSB) and grown at 37°C 
on a rotating shaker at 300 rpm in flasks or 14 mL test tubes or at 900 rpm in 96-well plates.
Vertebrate Animals—Conventional and germ-free 8-week old male C57BL/6J mice were 
acquired from Jackson Labs (Bar Harbor, ME) and used for all experiments in this study. 
Once received, conventional mice were housed at the Harvard Institute of Medicine 
Vivarium and germ-free mice housed at the Gnotobiotic and Microbiology Core Facility at 
Brigham and Women’s Hospital. All mice were socially housed and monitored daily for ~7 
days before experiments to permit acclimatization. Following intra-peritoneal infection 
and/or antibiotic treatment, mice were monitored twice for signs of dehydration and water

 intake and observed for signs of potential pain or distress associated with any intestinal 
discomfort. Animal protocols for the experiments performed in this study were approved by 
the Harvard Medical School Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and all 
experiments conform to relevant regulatory standards.
Cell Lines—Immortalized mouse SV129 macrophages were derived from a bone marrow 
cell line from male SV129 mice and authenticated by qPCR (Lee et al., 2006). Macrophages 
were maintained in 1 g/L glucose DMEM (Cell-Gro; Manassas, VA) supplemented with 
10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. SV129 macrophages were loaded onto 24-well 
tissue culture treated plates at 5·105 macrophages/well the day before experiment.
Method Details
Materials and Reagents—Ciprofloxacin (cipro) and all metabolites used as metabolic 
perturbations or metabolomic profiling standards were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. 
Louis, MO). BD Difco TSB and tryptic soy agar were purchased from Fisher Scientific 
(Hampton, NH). Uniformly labeled 13C glucose was purchased from Cambridge Isotope 
Laboratories, Inc. (Tewksbury, MA). LC-MS reagents were purchased from Honeywell 
Burdick & Jackson® (Muskegon, MI) and Sigma-Aldrich.
Animal Experiments—8-week old male C57BL/6J mice were intraperitoneally injected 
with 107 CFU E. coli cells in sterile saline. Control water or drinking water containing 100 
or 400 μg/mL cipro was introduced 4 h post infection. These concentrations were selected 
based on an estimate that a typical 25 g mouse drinks 4 mL of water each day, yielding a 
daily dose of 16 or 64 mg/kg/day cipro, which is in the 10–250 mg/kg/day range typically 
used to treat humans. Mice were sacrificed 20 h later; blood was harvested by cardiac 
puncture and plasma was isolated using lithium heparin tubes (Greiner Bio-One; 
Kremsmünster, Austria), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The peritoneum was 
lavaged with 5 mL sterile PBS in 2.5 mL increments. The lung was lavaged through the 
trachea with 5 mL sterile PBS in 0.7 mL increments. All samples were kept on ice following 
collection.
Metabolomic Profiling—Metabolites were acquired and quantified on an AB SCIEX 
Qtrap® 5500 mass spectrometer (AB SCIEX; Framingham, MA) and processed using 
MultiQuant® 3.0.1, as described previously (McCloskey et al., 2015). Metabolite extractions 
were performed using a 40:40:20 mixture of acetonitrile, methanol and LC-MS grade water 
in Phree Phospholipid Removal tubes (Phenomenex; Torrance, CA). Uniformly labeled 13C-
standards were generated by growing E. coli in uniformly labeled Glucose M9 minimal 
media in aerated shake flasks, as previously described (McCloskey et al., 2014). Calibration 
mixes of standards were split across several mixes, aliquoted, and lyophilized to dryness. All 
samples and calibrators were equally spiked with the same internal standards. Samples were 
quantified using isotope-dependent mass spectrometry. Calibration curves were run before 
and after all biological and analytical replicates. Consistency of quantification between 
calibration curves was checked by running a Quality Control sample composed of all 
biological replicates. Values reported are derived from the average of the biological 
triplicates, analyzed in duplicate (n = 6).

 Minimum Inhibitory Concentrations—Minimum Inhibitory Concentrations (MICs) 
were determined by microbroth dilution in 96-well microtiter plates with 1.5-fold step sizes 
of cipro dissolved in TSB, as previously described (Andrews, 2001). Approximately 104 
CFU E. coli suspended in TSB supplemented with 2–20 mM of each metabolite were added 
to each well of the 96-well plates to achieve a total volume of 200 μL. Plates were sealed 
with a breathable membrane and then incubated at 37°C with 900 rpm shaking for 20 h. 
Following incubation, OD600 was quantified on a SpectraMax M3 plate reader. MIC 
experiments were performed in at least triplicate from independent overnight cultures with 
values reported as the mean ± SEM.
Time-Kill Experiments—Time-kill experiments were performed as previously described 
(Dwyer et al., 2014). Briefly, an overnight culture of E. coli cells in TSB was diluted 1:1,000 
and grown to OD600 ~0.1 at 37°C with 300 rpm shaking prior to experiment. 1 mL cultures 
were then dispensed to 14 mL test tubes and treated with cipro and/or amp. Hourly samples 
were collected and serially diluted in PBS for colony enumeration 24 h later.
Macrophage Assays—In vitro phagocytosis assays were adapted from previously 
published protocols (Sokolovska et al., 2012) and performed using SV129 macrophages. On 
the day of experiment, culture media was replaced with 1 g/L DMEM supplemented with 
1% FBS. E. coli cells grown to OD600 ~0.3 in TSB and antibiotics were added to 
macrophages on ice for 30 min to synchronize phagocytosis. Plates were then incubated at 
37°C for 30 min with a control plate maintained on ice to quantify E. coli cells engulfed, but 
not killed. Cells were washed thrice with PBS + 0.5 mM EDTA. Cells were lysed with pH 
11.5 H2O for 4 min and serially diluted for colony enumeration 24 h later.
Oxygen Consumption Rate Quantification—Macrophage respiratory activity was 
quantified using the Seahorse XF Cell Mito Stress Test Kit and XFe96 Extracellular Flux 
Analyzer (Seahorse Bioscience; North Billerica, MA), according to the manufacturer’s 
instructions. Briefly, SV129 macrophages were plated at a density of 125,000 cells per well 
and cultured overnight before the start of the experiment. Cells were PBS washed and then 
pre-treated with cipro for 3 h in the XF Base Medium (Seahorse Bioscience; North Billerica, 
MA). The Mito Stress Test Kit assay was then performed using 2 μM oligomycin, 1 μM 
FCCP and 0.5 μM rotenone/antimycin A. Respiratory capacity was computed as the 
difference in oxygen consumption rate following FCCP treatment and following rotenone/
antimycin A.
Quantification and Statistical Analysis
Experimental Replicates—All in vivo metabolomic quantification experiments were 
performed using n = 3 mice in each treatment condition, with samples prepared in technical 
duplicate, yielding n = 6 samples for each condition. In vitro MIC estimations following 
metabolite supplementations were performed using n = 3–6 biological replicates of E. coli 
cells on different days. Time-kill experiments involving E. coli cells were performed in 
biological triplicate on different days. Oxygen consumption experiments were performed in 
biological triplicate with n = 5 technical replicates in different wells of the 96-well Seahorse 
cartridges on different days. In vitro measurements of immune function using SV129 mouse

 macrophages were performed with n = 3–4 biological replicates on different days, with n = 4 
technical replicates on 24-well tissue-culture treated plates.
Metabolite Quantification—Metabolite concentrations were estimated from LC-MS/MS 
peak heights using previously generated calibration curves. Metabolites found to have a 
quantifiable variability (RSD ≥ 50%) in the Quality Control samples or possessing 
individual components with a RSD ≥ 80% were excluded from analysis. Metabolites in 
blanks with a concentration greater than 80% of that found in the biological samples were 
similarly excluded. Missing values were imputed by bootstrapping using the R package 
Amelia II (v. 1.7.4, 1,000 imputations) (Honaker et al., 2011). Remaining missing values 
were approximated as ½ the lower limit of quantification for the metabolite normalized to 
the biomass of the sample. Metabolite concentrations from the peritoneum and lung were 
scaled 300- and 125-fold, respectively, to account for the dilution effect by a 5 mL lavage 
based on estimated peritoneal fluid volume of ~16 μL (Hartveit and Thunold, 1966) and 
estimated lung alveolar fluid volume of ~40 μL (Korfhagen et al., 1996).
Multivariate Analysis—Metabolite concentrations were first pre-processed with the 
generalized log transformation using the R package LMGene (v. 3.3) (Lu et al., 2008) and 
then centered to achieve an approximately normal distribution. Hierarchical clustering, 
principal components analysis and elastic net regularization were performed in MATLAB 
2016b (Mathworks; Natick, MA). Partial least squares discriminant analysis was performed 
using the MATLAB package Classification Toolbox (v. 4.0) (Ballabio and Consonni, 2013).
Metabolite Set Enrichment Analysis—Metabolite Set Enrichment Analysis (MSEA) 
was performed in Ecocyc (v. 20.1) (Keseler et al., 2017). SmartTables were created 
comprised of metabolites from each metabolite signature and pathways were identified using 
the “Enrichment and Depletion” analysis type. The Fisher Exact test was performed for each 
enrichment analysis with FDR correction by the Benjamini-Hochberg method.
Statistical Analysis—Statistical significance testing was performed in Prism v7.0b 
(Graphpad; San Diego, CA). One-way ANOVA was performed on data from all 
experiments. Reported p-values reflect false-discovery correction by the Holm-Šídák 
multiple comparisons test, with comparisons against either only the relevant control 
condition, or only against specific other conditions as indicated. Although ANOVA is 
generally robust against lack of normality in the data, statistical tests were not specifically 
performed to determine if all of the assumptions of ANOVA had been met.

 Figure 6. Metabolic effects of antibiotic treatment on host cells inhibit drug efficacy and impair 
immune function
During infection, antibiotics work in concert with immune cells to clear microbial pathogens 
(black). Meanwhile, antibiotics and pathogen cells metabolically remodel the local 
infectious microenvironment by acting on local host cells (dashed). Induced metabolites can 
inhibit drug efficacy and potentiate immune function (purple). Direct actions by antibiotics 
on immune cell metabolism can also impair immune cell phagocytic activity (red).
