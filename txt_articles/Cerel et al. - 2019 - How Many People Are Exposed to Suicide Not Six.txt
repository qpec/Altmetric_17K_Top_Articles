It has long been stated that six people are left behind following every sui-
cide. Despite a lack of empirical evidence, this has been extensively cited for
over 30 years. Using data from a random-digit dial survey, a more accurate
number of people exposed to each suicide is calculated. A sample of 1,736
adults included 812 lifetime suicide-exposed respondents who reported age and
number of exposures. Each suicide resulted in 135 people exposed (knew the
person). Each suicide affects a large circle of people, who may be in need of
clinician services or support following exposure.
In the wake of the over 44,000 suicides each
year
in
the
United
States,
it
is
often
repeated that six survivors are left behind
for
each
suicide
death
(Drapeau
&
McIntosh, 2017). This estimate, created by
Shneidman (1972), has been widely promul-
gated since the early 1970s, but was never
based on empirical evidence. Even if this
very conservative estimate were to be cor-
rect, 1 in 64 Americans (1.5% of the popu-
lation) would be considered significantly
impacted by a suicide (McIntosh, 2015).
Recent evidence shows that over and
above the impact of bereavement by other
causes, exposure to the suicide of a relative
increases risk for depression, admission to
psychiatric care, and suicide death (Pitman,
Osborn, King, & Erlangsen, 2014). Further,
clear risks have been shown in nonkin who
have been exposed to a suicide attempt and/or
death (Maple, Cerel, Sanford, Pearce, & Jor-
dan, 2017). There has been a call to change
the nomenclature of suicide bereavement to
recognize that exposure to suicide is on a con-
tinuum with some people exposed, some
affected, and some bereaved (Cerel, McIn-
tosh, Neimeyer, Maple, & Marshall, 2014).

 suicide as “anyone who knows or identifies
with someone who dies by suicide,” and stres-
ses no longer merely just focus on kin or those
who were exposed to the trauma of the death
itself (Cerel et al., 2014, p. 4).
Various studies have estimated differ-
ent percentages of the population exposed to
suicide. In 2002, Crosby and Sacks reported
that 7% of U.S. adults in 1994 knew someone
who died by suicide in the past year, including
1.1% who reported losing a relative and 5.4%
who reported exposure to the suicide death of
a friend or acquaintance. Based on the 7%
estimate plus vital statistics data on the num-
ber of suicide deaths in the United States in
1993, they further estimated that, on average,
there were 425 U.S. adults exposed per sui-
cide. In a more recent small survey, Cerel,
Maple, Aldrich, and van de Venne (2013)
reported that 40% of their random-digit dial
study of residents of one U.S. state reported
lifetime exposure to suicide, with almost 20%
reporting that the suicide had a significant
impact on their life. In a recent meta-analysis,
Andriessen, Rahman, Draper, Dudley, and
Mitchell
(2017)
determined
that
lifetime
prevalence of exposure in the community was
21.83% (CI: 16.32–27.90). Another recent
examination of participants in the military sui-
cide research consortium studies revealed that
more than half (57.3%) reported lifetime sui-
cide exposure (SE), mostly to the deaths of
friends (Hom, Stanley, Gutierrez, & Joiner,
2017). Despite these findings, the historical
assumption of six survivors for every suicide
has remained entrenched, hampering efforts
to illuminate the public health importance of
identifying, supporting, and developing treat-
ments for those exposed to suicide who are in
need of support.
Utilizing random-digit dial data from
a single U.S. state sample of 1,736 adults, we
reported that almost half of participants
(48.3%) reported lifetime exposure to suicide
(Cerel et al., 2016). Suicide-exposed individu-
als were more likely than nonsuicide exposed
to report suicide ideation (9.0% vs. 5.3%). A
close or very close relationship was reported
by 36.2% of the sample. When a measure of
perceptions of closeness to the decedent was
added to models, the magnitude of the associ-
ations with poor psychiatric outcomes was
increased. Perceptions of closeness to the
decedent almost doubled the odds of depres-
sion and anxiety and almost quadrupled the
odds of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)
in those exposed to suicide.
Thus, the current re-examination of
our data sought to calculate how many peo-
ple are likely exposed to each suicide death
in the United States, extrapolated from a
single-state random-digit dial survey asking
about lifetime exposure to suicide.
METHODS
Survey Design
A random-digit dial survey of adults
in the Commonwealth of Kentucky was
conducted
during
July
2012–June
2013.
This study was approved by the University
of
Kentucky
internal
review
board
and
determined in compliance with Department
of Defense (DoD) human protections poli-
cies by the DoD Human Research Protec-
tion Office. A dual-frame sample of landline
and cell phone numbers, weighted to reflect
the true distribution of landline only, cell
only, and dual-use households in Kentucky,
were called to achieve a final sample of
1,736 participants.
Due to funding sources and the desire
to answer study questions about veterans’
exposure to suicide (see Cerel et al., 2015),
veterans were deliberately oversampled. As
described elsewhere, the Council of American
Survey Research Organizations response rate
for the study was 35.9% (Cerel, Maple, van
de Venne, Moore, Flaherty & Brown, 2016).
Overall, calls averaged 12.7 � 5.9 minutes.
Following oral consent, the respondent was
interviewed utilizing the following measures
(see Cerel et al., 2015).
Measures
Exposure to Suicide.
Participants were
queried as to whether they knew anyone
530
NOT SIX
 who died by suicide (“Do you know anyone
who has died by suicide?”). Those who
reported exposure to a suicide death were
then asked the number of exposures they
had experienced in their lifetime, facilitating
identification of total number of SEs among
participants. For multiple suicides, the clos-
est relationship was used to describe the
impact and closeness. Therefore, those vari-
ables were not available for each exposure
an individual reported and could not be uti-
lized in calculations in this study.
Demographics.
Self-reported
demo-
graphic data included age, race, sex, marital
status, and rural/urban residence status based
on county of residence, status as a parent, and
veteran status.
Population and Sample.
The popula-
tion of interest included all adults (18 years
of age and older) living in the Common-
wealth of Kentucky at the time of the tele-
phone survey. Of the 1,736 participants, 34
were excluded from analysis for missing
responses to the exposure to suicide ques-
tion or the age question, leaving 1,702 par-
ticipants contributing to the final analysis.
Statistical Methods
Similarly to Crosby and Sacks (2002),
we recognized that our sampling strategy to
sample veterans oversampled men. Thus, the
data required weighting to be representative
of the state population. Weights included
both phone-specific weights as described ear-
lier and a poststratification weight to ensure
that military veteran, age, race, and sex were
scaled up to fully represent similar individu-
als in the sample compared to the population
of adults in the Commonwealth. Thus, this
sample contained the same percentage of vet-
erans as the Commonwealth and did not uti-
lize the oversample of veteran status. SPSS
Statistics 23.0 for Windows (IBM Corp.,
Armonk, NY, USA) and SAS 9.4 for Win-
dows (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA)
software were utilized for the specialized sur-
vey data analysis.
We produced a weighted estimate of
the total number of lifetime SE for Kentucky
adults in 2012 from the survey sample, and a
weighted estimate of total person-years at
risk of SE for Kentucky adults in 2012 based
on the sum of respondent ages at the time of
the survey. We estimated the mean cumula-
tive incidence rate of SE among Kentucky
adults in 2012 by dividing weighted total
lifetime SE by weighted total person-years at
risk of exposure. We multiplied this inci-
dence rate by the number of U.S. resident
adults in 2012 (obtained from U.S. Census
Bureau, 2015) to estimate the total number
of SE in 2012 among U.S. adults, which we
denote by SEUS. We also obtained the num-
ber of suicide deaths among U.S. residents in
2012, which we denote by SUUS, from the
CDC WISQARS database (Centers for Dis-
ease Control and Prevention, 2015). Finally,
we
estimated
the
number
of
exposures
per suicide among U.S. adults in 2012 as
EPSUS = SEUS/SUUS.
RESULTS
Final analysis consisted of 1,702 par-
ticipants, of whom 46.7% (795 individuals)
reported exposure to suicide during their
lifetime and had nonmissing age and age at
exposure
variables.
Participants
reported
2,286 lifetime exposures over 98,399 per-
son-years. The mean lifetime SE incidence
rate for Kentucky adults in 2012 therefore
was calculated to be 0.0232 exposures per
person-year. Using the exposure rate 0.0232
to multiply exposure incidence to the U.S.
adult (over 18) population of 235,185,953
(U.S. Census Bureau, 2015) yielded an esti-
mated 5,463,841 SE for U.S. adults in
2012. Dividing by the 40,600 suicide deaths
reported in 2012 in the United States (Cen-
ters for Disease Control and Prevention,
2015) results in an estimate of 135 U.S.
adults
exposed
per
suicide
death
that
occurred in 2012 in the United States.
Extrapolating these state-based findings to
the total 2012 U.S. population of 235 mil-
lion adults by 40,600 suicides (Centers for
Disease
Control
and
Prevention,
2015)
leads to approximately 5.5 million people in
CEREL ET AL.
531
 the United States exposed to suicides in
their social networks annually.
DISCUSSION
Based on our findings, it is clear that
for each death by suicide many more are
exposed than the previously repeated six indi-
viduals. For each suicide, our data estimate
that 135 people are exposed to the death,
resulting in 5.5 million U.S. residents exposed
to suicide in a given 12-month period.
The current study was drawn from a
single U.S. state with the fifteenth highest
suicide rate in the United States. Thus, the
generalizability
to
the
U.S.
population
might be overstated. The suicide deaths
which
resulted
in
exposure
to
suicide
reported by our respondents could have
occurred outside of the state and the abso-
lute number of deaths in the nation (40,000)
is substantially more than the absolute num-
ber in the state (724). Calculating the esti-
mated number of exposures per suicide
using only Kentucky data would ignore this
fact. Therefore, the calculation was based on
national data, as the national suicide rate
(12.9) is lower than the rate in Kentucky
(16.5). In addition, suicides that took place
outside the United States would not be
accounted for in the population estimates of
potential exposures. There are a number of
conceivable reasons why our estimate is
lower than the one reported in 2002 by
Crosby and Sacks. First, the question in this
study asked about lifetime exposure to sui-
cide death, while Crosby and Sacks asked
about exposure over the past 12 months
only. Therefore, recall bias might have elim-
inated reporting of more distal exposures in
our sample. Also, relatively little is known
about geographic and cultural differences,
or temporal changes, in the stigma sur-
rounding suicide. In areas where such stigma
is greater one might expect SE to be lower
due to the cause of death not being disclosed
as a suicide or a lack of willingness to
describe it this way to researchers. Similarly,
if there had been some reduction in suicide
stigma over time, a study assessing lifetime
exposure would be expected to produce a
lower estimate than one asking only about
past-year exposure as people would be una-
ware of hidden suicides in their extended
social networks. This is best exemplified by a
family in which eight people had died by sui-
cide in the last three generations, but it was
never spoken of until a recent death caused
some family members to start asking ques-
tions and uncover the genuine cause of death
of their relatives.
Some additional limitations of this
study include assumptions that the risk of
exposure to suicide is constant from year to
year,
individuals
who
responded
to
the
phone survey are representative of the gen-
eral U.S. population, and that network sizes
are normally distributed. It is clear that sui-
cides often occur in clusters or at specific
developmental periods rather than being
evenly distributed throughout the lifespan.
In addition, many people who die by sui-
cide have experienced a long trajectory of
severe mental illness and a history of social
isolation, and might have a smaller social
network than individuals who end their lives
under
different
circumstances.
We
were
unable to prove any of the assumptions
based on the current study methodology,
yet chose to make the calculations with an
understanding that those assumptions were
made.
Our results are restricted by these
limitations, yet for the first time we are able
to calculate a statistically sound estimate of
lifetime exposure to suicide in the United
States. There is still a need to replicate this
study nationally and internationally so that
the effects of each suicide can be better
appreciated.
It would have been most helpful for
the field to stratify these findings by close-
ness to the decedent as this has been shown
to be associated with risk for psychopathol-
ogy
(Cerel
et al.,
2016).
The
suicides
reported by participants range from those
closest to them to only very distant social
contacts. However, due to the analytic strat-
egy of utilizing all suicide exposures reported
532
NOT SIX
 by respondents but only asking about the
closeness to the individual closest to the
respondent, we were unable to calculate the
number of people exposed at each level of
closeness. This is an area that requires future
research
to
more
deeply
explore
those
among the exposed group who are most dee-
ply affected, and who will require interven-
tion to support them postexposure.
This study successfully identifies the
difference in the long-standing proposition of
six people exposed per suicide versus the
empirically assessed value of 135 people
exposed to suicide. Some might argue that the
six people per suicide was meant to include
only those whose lives were forever changed
by the suicide and this new calculation is a dif-
ferent type of number than the six. We agree
that 135 is not the number of people who are
definitely bereaved by each suicide. Exposure
is important because we simply do not know
the scale and magnitude of those affected by
suicide, and the prevalence of those in society
who may be in need of both suicide preven-
tion and postsuicide support and services,
postvention. Given the identified magnitude
of difference, the old speculations must be
cast aside to allow increases in services and
resources for the bereaved to mitigate the
long-term effects from suicide. These data
confirm suicide postvention as a necessary
public health priority.
CONCLUSION
Although
previous
clinical
wisdom
prompted discussion of the impact of suicide
on multiple individuals on the spectrum of
suicide exposure, it seems that estimates of
the scope of this impact have been grossly
understated or underappreciated. As we are
able to present data-based analyses of the
number of people exposed to each suicide, it
is now time to begin to use these empirically
supported calculations rather than repeating
the misleading number “six individuals left
behind” that has historically been reported
after a suicide death. In so doing, we can
now focus our postvention efforts on a
broader group of people who may require
support to reduce harm from exposure to
suicide. Identifying these individuals may
constitute
an
interdisciplinary
approach,
including public health surveillance, as well
as routine screening in school systems, uni-
versities, primary care offices, emergency
departments,
and
hospitals.
Developing
competencies
around
assessment
of
the
impact of suicide exposure and its treatment
will be forthcoming, but, given the burden
of suicide and the potential for intervention
through thoughtful postvention, perhaps sui-
cide may be elevated in the public health
conversation to reduce the impact of suicide
death on those exposed.
