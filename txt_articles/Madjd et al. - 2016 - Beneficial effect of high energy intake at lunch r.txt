ABSTRACT
Background: The association between the time of nutrient intake
and health has been described in a few studies. To our knowledge,
no study has evaluated the relation between high energy intakes at
lunch compared with at dinner on weight loss in overweight and
obese subjects.
Objective: We compared the effect of high energy intake at lunch
with that at dinner on weight loss and cardiometabolic risk factors
in women during a weight-loss program.
Design: Overweight and obese women [n = 80; body mass index
(BMI; in kg/m2): 27–35; age: 18–45 y] were asked to eat either
a main meal at lunch (LM) or a main meal at dinner (DM) for 12 wk
while in a weight-loss program.
Results: A total of 80 participants were randomly assigned to one of
2 intervention groups. Sixty-nine subjects (86%) completed the trial
(34 subjects in the DM group, and 35 subjects in the LM group).
Baseline variables were not significantly different between groups.
A significant reduction in anthropometric measurements and significant
improvements in cardiometabolic risk characteristics were observed
over 12 wk in both groups. Compared with the DM group, the LM
group had greater mean 6 SD reductions in weight (LM: 25.85 6
1.96 kg; DM: 24.35 6 1.98 kg; P = 0.003), BMI (LM: 2.276 0.76;
DM: 1.68 6 0.76; P = 0.003), homeostasis model assessment of insulin
resistance (LM: 20.66 6 0.33; DM: 20.46 6 0.24; P = 0.001),
and fasting insulin (LM: 22.01 6 1.10 mIU/mL; DM: 21.16 6
0.72 mIU/mL; P , 0.001) after 12 wk. However, there were no
significant differences for fasting plasma glucose and lipid pro-
files within both groups after 12 wk.
Conclusions: The consumption of higher energy intake at lunch
compared with at dinner may result in favorable changes in weight
loss in overweight and obese women after a weight-loss program of
12 wk. The consumption may also offer clinical benefits to improve
insulin resistance. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as
NCT02399280.

INTRODUCTION
There is an interest in discovering the effects of eating patterns
on body weight and energy metabolism (e.g., the frequency of
eating and timing of consumption throughout the day) (1). In-
deed, previous studies have investigated different aspects of the
meal pattern including the daily meal frequency and circadian
distribution of intake (2), irregular meal frequency (3–5), and
omission of breakfast (6) on weight control and cardiometabolic
risk factors.
There is an association between breakfast skipping, late-night
eating, and obesity as has been defined in cross-sectional (7, 8)
and longitudinal (9–13) studies. Previous studies have indicated
that obese people tend to eat less in the morning and more in the
evening than do lean controls (10, 11, 14, 15). However, these
results were not confirmed by other authors (16).
Until now, few recommendations have existed for the ap-
propriate distribution of intake of energy across the day (17).
There has also been limited research describing the distribution of
energy and macronutrients at a population level (18, 19). Nev-
ertheless, there has been evidence that the timing of energy and
nutrient intake has shifted slightly over time with a greater
proportion of intake later in the day (20). Data from a recent
observational study (21) also indicated that eating more of daily
total energy intake at midday was associated with lower risk of
being overweight or obese, whereas consuming more in the
evening was associated with higher risk. Health professionals and
nutritionists generally recommend that obese people who desire
to lose weight should eat their main meal at lunch rather than at
dinner. However, this recommendation seems to have been on
only a few studies. A clinical study showed that eating late in the
day was associated with reductions in resting energy expenditure,
fasting carbohydrate oxidation, and glucose tolerance (22).
Additional evidence indicated that late-lunch eating may have
deleterious effects on the success of weight-loss therapy (23). In
addition, a recent study on the effects of a high-energy breakfast

 with reduced intake at dinner showed beneficial results on the
management of obesity and metabolic syndrome (24).
To our knowledge, there are few studies that have evaluated
whether higher energy intake at lunch than at dinner results in
greater weight loss in overweight and obese subjects when
they are consuming an energy-restricted diet. In addition, this
comparison has not been made with respect to lipid and
glucose metabolism in this group. Thus, the purpose of this
study was to compare the effects of a high energy intake at
lunch with those at dinner with respect to body weight [and
waist circumference (WC)5] as a primary outcome and car-
bohydrate and lipid metabolism as a secondary outcome in
overweight and obese women after a comprehensive 12-wk
weight-loss program.
METHODS
Subjects
Healthy overweight and obese women were selected between
March 2015 and October 2015 from participants who were
attending the NovinDiet Clinic to lose weight. Inclusion criteria
were as follows: women who were aged 18–45 y with BMI (in
kg/m2) from 27 to 35 who were willing to introduce a dietary
change to lose weight and had the ability to have moderate
exercise. All subjects were required to be nonsmokers and free
of an established self-reported history of cardiovascular dis-
eases, stroke, diabetes, liver diseases, kidney diseases, de-
pression, cancer, or autoimmune disease. Subjects included
women who were able to demonstrate that they were able to
keep an adequate 4-d food record and showed a readiness to
safely participate in daily physical activity (PA).
Exclusion criteria were as follows: pregnancy or lactation
during the previous 6 mo or planned pregnancy in the next 6 mo;
weight loss $10% of body weight #6 mo before enrollment in
the study; participation in a research project involving weight
loss or PA in the previous 6 mo; and taking a medication to lower
lipids or cholesterol or that could affect metabolism or a change
body weight. Subjects who report heart disorders, frequent chest
pains, or faintness or dizziness on the Physical Activity Readiness
Questionnaire were excluded.
The study was approved by the Ethical Committee of the
Digestive Research Institute, Tehran University of Medical
Science. All subjects provided signed consent before study
enrollment. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as
NCT02399280.
Study design and interventions
The study was a 2-arm randomized clinical trial. Appropriate
subjects were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio after baseline
measures with the use of a computer-generated random-
numbers method by the project coordinator with allocation
concealed from the subjects and dietitians until the random
assignment was revealed to the study subjects at the initial
intervention clinic appointment. Groups were separated into
subjects who had their main meal at dinner (DM) and subjects
who had their main meal at lunch (LM). Subjects were assigned
to consume 15% of their energy intakes at breakfast and 15% of
their energy intakes with their snacks, with either 50% of daily
energy intake at lunch and 20% of daily energy intake at dinner
(LM group) or vice versa (DM group). Both groups started
a hypoenergetic diet according to the NovinDiet protocol,
which included advice to gradually increase activity levels to
achieve 60 min of moderate activity 5 d/wk. Biweekly visits to
the dietitian were required to promote adherence to the
hypoenergetic diet and meal pattern. In addition, a registered
dietitian had a telephone conversation with each subject every
weekday during the study to check adherence to the meal
pattern and diet.
Screening visit
At screening visits, a general medicine doctor examined
subjects. All subjects completed the Beck Depression Inventory
(25) and the Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire (26).
Potential subjects were instructed in how to keep a 4-d food
record by a research nutritionist. In the 30-min lesson, emphasis
was placed on the necessity of the time recording and of keeping
an accurate food and drink record for 4 consecutive days, which
included 3 weekdays and 1 weekend day. The food record was
evaluated for completeness at the next visit, and subjects were
excluded if it was not sufficiently detailed.
Dietary and activity intervention sessions
The NovinDiet Clinic is a private weight-loss clinic that uses
an integrated approach (dietary, behavioral, exercise, and
medical treatments). The clinic staff engages in research as
well as providing clinical services. Participants in the study did
not pay Clinic fees. The NovinDiet protocol is based on de-
veloping a problem solving approach for each member in-
dividually and addresses both diet and exercise. In this study,
the program was designed to enable a weight loss of 7–10%
of the starting body weight at a rate of 0.5–1 kg/wk over
12 wk. The individual diet programs were based on the par-
ticipants’ food diary records and their food preferences with
gradual modification to bring their diets in line with the
NovinDiet protocol. Participants were assigned to receive
a hypoenergetic diet with a mainly high-carbohydrate, low–
saturated fat dietary pattern [17% of energy from protein, 23%
from fat (,10% from saturated fat), and 60% from carbohy-
drate, with $400 g fruit and vegetables to achieve a fiber
intake recommendation of 25g/d]. Subjects were encouraged
to gradually increase activity levels to achieve 60 min of
moderate activity (mostly brisk walking) 5 d/wk. They were
asked to report their daily PA levels at biweekly sessions in
which subjects were encouraged to follow the PA instruction
by the dietitians. Predominant behavior-change strategies ap-
plied included stages of change, goal setting, self-monitoring
with food diaries, waist measurements, and PA (27, 28).
At biweekly sessions, each participant’s reported behavior
problems regarding the weight-loss program were discussed.
Resources were provided as home booklets for each subject
to record adherence to the diet protocol. During the in-
tervention period, participants completed the feedback form
regarding their adherence to the diets and their PA levels
and had access to a website, weekly Internet magazines, and

 one-to-one telephone and online support from a consultant
physician if needed.
Measurements
Anthropometric measurements were taken at baseline and after
12 wk (except for height, which was taken only at the screening
visit) by the dietitian.
Energy and macronutrient intakes at baseline and at the last
week of the intervention (week 12) were analyzed with the use of
Nutritionist IV software (version 4.1; Hearst). Blood samples of all
subjects were taken after overnight (8–10-h) fasting between 0700
and 0900 at baseline and 12 wk for biochemical, cellular, and
hormonal measurements. Fasting blood samples were collected by
venipuncture according to a standard protocol.
Anthropometric measurements
Body weight was taken to the nearest 0.1 kg with the use of
a digital calibrated scale (Omron Healthcare with participants

 wearing light clothing and no shoes. Body height was measured to
the nearest 0.1 cm with the use of a wall-mounted stadiometer
(SECA) with participants barefoot and in a free-standing position.
WC was measured with a flexible, nonstretching measuring tape
and recorded to the nearest 0.5 cm. WC was measured at the
smallest horizontal circumference between the ribs and iliac crest
(the natural waist) or, in case of an indeterminable waist narrowing,
halfway between the lower rib and the iliac crest (29). BMI was
calculated from measured weight divided by the square of height.
Blood sample measurements
Blood samples from an antecubital vein via a venipuncture
were taken while subjects were in a sitting position according to
the standard protocol (30) and were centrifuged at 2000 3 at
room temperature within 30–45 min. Blood samples for 2-h
postprandial (2hpp) glucose were taken 2 h after subjects in-
gested 75 g glucose according to the standard method, and the
criteria of the American Diabetes Association were used for
excluding diabetes (31, 32). Fasting plasma glucose and 2hpp
concentrations were measured with the use of the enzymatic
colorimetric method. Insulin was measured with the use of
a radioimmunoassay with 125I-labeled human insulin and a human
insulin antiserum in an immunoradiometric assay (Biosource)
with a g-counter system (Gamma I; Genesys). Insulin resistance
was evaluated with the use of the HOMA-IR, which was cal-
culated as follows (33):
HOMA - IR ¼ ½ fasting insulin ðmU=LÞ
3 FPG ðmmol=LÞ� O 22:5
ð1Þ
Glycated hemoglobin was measured with the use of a colorimetric
method after an initial separation by ion-exchange chromatogra-
phy (Biosystem).
Biochemical analyses of the serum total cholesterol, tri-
glyceride, and HDL cholesterol were carried out with the use
of a Selectra E autoanalyzer (Vita Laboratory) according to
standard procedures of diagnostic kits (Pars Azmoon) (34).
LDL cholesterol was calculated with the use of Friedewald’s
formula (35) as
LDL cholesterol ¼ total cholesterol 2 HDL cholesterol
þ ðTGO2:2Þ
ð2Þ
Statistical analyses
Baseline values of cardiovascular disease risk factors (including
weight, WC, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, total cholesterol,
fasting plasma glucose, triglyceride, fasting insulin, HOMA-IR,
glycated hemoglobin, and 2hpp glucose were compared between
DM and LM groups with the use of unpaired t tests.
At baseline, the distribution was normal for all variables. All
participants who were randomly assigned and completed an initial
assessment were included in the final results in an intention-to-treat
analysis. Multiple imputations with the use of linear regression
were used to impute missing values from 12 wk and were based on
the assumption that data were missing at random. We used an
ANCOVA to compare outcomes between the 2 groups by ad-
justment of baseline values as covariates. In addition, an ANOVA
with repeated measures was used for within-group comparisons.
The primary outcome of this study was the difference in body-
weight loss after a 12-wk weight-loss program. The power
calculation was based on the results described by Jakubowicz
et al. (24) (a = 0.05, power = 0.9), which were performed on the
basis of expected mean 6 SD differences in weight loss between
diet groups of 5 6 10 kg to determine the targeted final sample
size (n = 43). With consideration of a dropout rate of 40%, the
sample size required was 74. Therefore, 80 subjects were ran-
domly assigned to the 2 groups of the intervention.
Statistical significance was set at P # 0.05. All data are
presented as means 6 SDs unless otherwise stated. All statistical
analyses were performed with the use of SPSS 22.0 for Win-
dows software (IBM SPSS).
RESULTS
Baseline characteristics
From 94 individuals who were interested in participating in the
study, 2 subjects were excluded from the study because of the
results of the Beck depression questionnaire (Beck Depression
Inventory Score .9). Three potential subjects were excluded
because they stopped keeping a dietary record or filled it in in-
sufficiently. Blood test and questionnaire results at baseline re-
vealed that 8 patients were ineligible because of having one or
more of the following exclusion criteria: 3 subjects had type 2
diabetes (fasting plasma glucose concentrations $7 mmol/L), 3
subjects had a history of cardiovascular disease, and 2 subjects
had liver diseases (aspartate aminotransferase concentrations
.34 IU/L; alanine aminotransferase concentrations .38 IU/L).
One subject was excluded as a result of the PA questionnaire. The
remaining 80 subjects gave written consent, and 40 subjects were
randomly allocated to each group. At total of 69 subjects com-
pleted the 12-wk intervention (86% of the randomly assigned
population) (Figure 1). After the start of the intervention, a total of

 11 subjects dropped out because they did not wish to continue or
because of unexpected situations. At week 12, retention rates
were 87% in the LM group and 85% in the DM group. At
baseline, there were no significant differences in physical char-
acteristics or biochemical measurements between intervention
groups (Table 1).
Body weight, BMI, and WC
As shown in Table 2, there was a significant weight reduction
in each group after 12 wk (P , 0.001). There was also a sig-
nificant difference in weight reduction between the 2 groups
after 12 wk (P = 0.002) (Table 2).
BMI reduction in each group was in the expected direction
with significant effects over 12 wk for both groups (P , 0.001).
However, the decline in BMI was greater in the LM group than
in the DM group after 12 wk (Table 2) with a significant dif-
ference in BMI effects between the 2 groups (P = 0.003). In
both groups, WC had decreased after 12 wk of intervention
(P , 0.001) with no significant difference in WC effects be-
tween the 2 groups after the intervention. (P = 0.118).
Lipid profiles
Reductions in total-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, and tri-
glyceride concentrations and an increase in HDL cholesterol
were detected over 12 wk of the study in each group (P ,
0.001), but there were no significant differences between
groups after 12 wk (Table2).
Glucose metabolism measurement
Fasting plasma glucose, fasting serum insulin, 2hpp glucose,
glycated hemoglobin, and HOMA-IR all decreased over time in
both groups (P , 0.001). However, between-group differences
were only significant for insulin and HOMA-IR after 12 wk of
intervention (Table 2).
There was a significant difference in changes in fasting
serum insulin concentrations between the 2 groups after 12 wk
(P , 0.001) (Table 2) and a significant improvement in insulin
resistance in the LM group compared with in the DM group
after 12 wk (P , 0.001).
Food intake measurement
At baseline, there was no significant difference in energy and
macronutrient intakes. Estimated energy intake measurements
showed a significant reduction over time in both groups (P-time
effect , 0.001). As shown in Table 3, there were no signifi-
cant differences between groups for total energy and macro-
nutrient intakes from baseline to 12 wk.
DISCUSSION
The aim of the current study was to evaluate the effects of
higher energy intake at lunch compared with at dinner on
weight loss and also on indexes of carbohydrate and lipid
metabolism in overweight and obese women who were at-
tending a weight-loss program for 12 wk. We showed that
consumption of the main meal at lunch led to more weight loss
and a greater improvement in insulin sensitivity as measured by

knowledge, this is the first randomized controlled trial of the
effect on weight loss of the timing of the main meal.
A recent cross-sectional analysis indicated that eating more of
the day’s total energy intake at midday than in the evening is
associated with lower risk of obesity (21).
The results of the current study on the effect of high energy intake
at dinner on weight are in agreement with those of 2 recent inter-
ventional studies (24, 36) that indicated the favorable effects of early
eating throughout the day on weight loss. However, the 2 studies
compared a high-energy breakfast with a high-energy dinner (24) or
eating breakfast and lunch compared with eating 6 meals/d (36),
whereas the current study compared a high-energy lunch with a high-
energy dinner. In addition, the previous studies involved obese and
overweight participants with metabolic syndrome and type 2 di-
abetes, whereas we recruited healthy obese and overweight women.
All of the participants in our weight-loss program lost weight
in a way that was consistent with their energy prescription. In
intensive, clinic-based behavioral lifestyle–modification pro-
grams, weight losses of 5–10% have been detected at 6 mo (37–
39), which were approximately similar to the weight losses that
we observed during 12 wk in the current study. This finding was
not unexpected because our weight-loss program included en-
ergy restriction, activity monitoring, and frequent patient visits
and consultations in the clinic. It has been shown that these
approaches are more consistently effective than other methods
that recommend small but theoretically sustainable lifestyle
modifications that can be made to improve health (40).
Our results are consistent with the study of Garaulet et al. (23),
which showed late eaters lost less weight than was lost by early
eaters (23). These findings confirm that the timing of the main
meal independently seems to be an important factor in weight-
loss success. Thus, the timing of eating may be an appropriate
factor to consider in weight-loss treatments.
In our study, the positive effect on weight loss of high energy
intake at lunch compared with at dinner may reflect better ad-
herence to the diet in the LM group. The explanation for greater
weight loss in the LM group might have been that, when subjects
eat a larger energy intake early in the day, they eat significantly
less over the entire day. Conversely, when subjects eat a higher
proportion of their total intake during the evening, they eat
significantly more over the entire day (41). However, our data on
estimated energy intakes and macronutrient compositions did not
confirm this assumption and showed no differences between the
2 groups. Thus, additional long-term studies with more accurate
energy intakes and PA measurements are needed to find the
underlying mechanisms that resulted in better weight loss in the
LM group than in the DM group.
In the current study, reductions in WC and significant im-
provements in cardiometabolic risk characteristics were observed
in both groups as was expected because of the weight loss ob-
served. Despite similar changes in fasting glucose concentrations
in both groups, insulin sensitivity appeared to be improved more
in the LM group than in the DM group over 12 wk because of
larger changes in fasting insulin.
The current study also showed a strong change in circulating
insulin concentrations after the weight-loss intervention over
12 wk as expected. However, fasting insulin after the intervention
was higher when the large energy load was given in the evening as
dinner than at midday as lunch. This result might indicate that
higher energy intake at dinner may cause a significantly greater
insulin response than would the same meal consumed at lunch.
This outcome was consistent with a previous short-term study
(42) that was conducted in healthy volunteers with a different
design and evaluated the short-term effects of high energy intake
at breakfast compared with at dinner in combination with the
effect of the glycemic index.
A previous study by Morgan et al. (43) also showed an im-
paired postprandial lipid tolerance when meals were consumed
at night compared with during the daytime. However, our results
failed to show any significant difference in lipid profiles between
LM and DM groups. Note that our recommended diet for weight
loss contained a low percentage of fat, whereas the study by
Morgan et al. (43) had a different design in terms of not including
any weight-loss plan.
Nutritionists and popular weight-loss programs usually advise
individuals who are keen to lose weight to have their main meal at
lunch. In contrast, many obese people who are trying to lose
weight are used to eating a higher-energy meal at dinner because
of work commitments during the day and believe that they can
have their main meal at dinner in a low-energy diet without any
deleterious effects on their weight management. The findings of
our current study may have practical implications indicating that

 the consumption of a main meal at lunch and not at dinner could
improve weight loss when people use a weight-loss program.
The principal strengths of this study are, first, that it was
a randomized, outpatient, clinical trial, in which subjects were
following a comprehensive diet plan for weight control. Second,
subjects wished to lose weight, and the study included middle-
aged overweight and obese women who were able to comply with
a weight-loss plan; thus, the women showed that they were
motivated to adhere to the protocol of the weight-loss diet (44).
Third, the provision of a free diet plan and a daily telephone call
from a dietitian to each subject was an encouragement for regular
biweekly visits with the dietitian when compliance could be
encouraged in both groups. Also, because this study was con-
ducted in a free-living population, the results can be directly
related to obese and overweight women who seek to lose weight.
In contrast, the limitation of the current study is the short-term
intervention period. Future research is required to examine the
long-term health effect of a high-energy lunch relative to a high-
energy dinner to establish whether the benefits that we showed are
sustained and result in an accumulative, clinically relevant dif-
ference in weight. In addition, this study was performed only in
overweight and obese women who were attending a formal weight-
loss program. Longer-term studies are required in a broader range
of participants both in subjects in a formal weight-loss program and
in individuals who are attempting to lose weight with less formal,
intensive support.
In conclusion, the consumption of the main meal at lunch
appears to provide beneficial effects on weight loss and insulin
sensitivity in overweight and obese women who are adhering to
a weight-loss program over the shorter term. Longer-term studies
are required in both healthy overweight and obese patients and in
individuals whose insulin sensitivity is compromised (e.g.,
prediabetic and diabetic patients).
