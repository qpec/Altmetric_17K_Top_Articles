ABSTRACT 
26 
Objective: To systematically review studies examining the role of psychological 
27 
interventions in injury prevention. The primary research question was: (1) What is the real-
28 
world effectiveness of psychological intervention in preventing sports injuries?  
29 
Design: Mixed method systematic review with best evidence synthesis 
30 
Data sources: CINAHL, MEDLINE, PsycARTICLES, PsycINFO, SPORTDiscus, Science 
31 
Direct and PubMed 
32 
Eligibility criteria for selecting studies: Randomised control trials (RCTs), non-RCTs that 
33 
included a comparison group, before and after study designs and qualitative methods. Studies 
34 
were required to outline specific unimodal or multimodal psychological interventions used in 
35 
relation to injury prevention in the real-world setting.  
36 
Outcome measure: Studies were independently appraised with the Mixed-Methods 
37 
Appraisal Tool (MMAT).  
38 
• Results: Thirteen papers (incorporating 14 studies) met the eligibility criteria, of which 
39 
93% (13/14) reported a decrease in injury rates (effect size range = 0.2 – 1.21). There was 
40 
an overall moderate risk of bias in reporting (52%). There is a dominance of stress 
41 
management-based interventions in literature due to the prominence of the Model of 
42 
Stress and Athletic Injury within the area. 
43 
Summary/conclusions: Psychological interventions demonstrate small (0.2) to large 
44 
(1.21) effects on sports injury rates. The research area demonstrates a cumulative 
45 
moderate risk in reporting bias (52%).

What is already known and why this review is needed 
51 
• Psychosocial interventions, such as stress management interventions, may reduce injury 
52 
rates 
53 
• Sport injury risk is multifactorial; structured injury prevention programmes must account 
54 
for this multifactorial nature 
55 
• Existing systematic reviews and meta-analyses have excluded potentially relevant studies 
56 
and have centred attention on the efficacy of interventions (laboratory setting) as opposed 
57 
to their effectiveness (real world setting). 
58 
What are the new findings? 
59 
• 93% of studies in this review were associated with a lower sports injury rates and/or 
60 
injury time-loss 
61 
• Psychological interventions demonstrate a range of effect sizes (0.2 – 1.21) which suggest 
62 
they can contribute to injury prevention.  
63 
• Even low frequency and short duration interventions, with a low risk of bias, reduced 
64 
injury rates (ES = 0.2 – 0.99).  
65 
• Future studies should consider sample size estimations, completeness of outcome data, 
66 
reporting of attrition rates, and monitoring and reporting of compliance and adherence 
67 
rates more closely.

INTRODUCTION 
76 
The incidence of injury in sports range from 0.5-34 injuries/1000 hours,1 with injury being 
77 
one of the leading causes of early retirement from sport.2 Sports injuries have significant 
78 
psychosocial impacts on athletes that can influence the quality of return to sport (RTS), 
79 
decrease the chance of RTS3,4 or increase the time taken to RTS.5 Injuries have financial6 and 
80 
performance-related7 costs to teams. Injury prevention is a priority for sports injury 
81 
practitioners and policymakers.8  
82 
Psychological factors are an intrinsic risk factor predisposing the athlete to injury, and 
83 
should be considered for injury prevention programmes.8,9 As injury causation is 
84 
multifactorial, it follows that injury prevention programmes should target each of the multiple 
85 
causes. Psychological interventions have often been overlooked.10-12 Consequently, a 
86 
comprehensive systematic review would help form a knowledge base, providing sports injury 
87 
practitioners with information regarding the effectiveness of psychosocial interventions for 
88 
injury prevention and the quality of the evidence.  
89 
 
Psychosocial factors including attention disturbance, arousal levels, anxiety, stress, 
90 
daily hassles and negative life events are predictive for sports injuries, and psychological 
91 
intervention can help to lessen the impact of these on individuals.13-23 Psychosocial injury 
92 
prevention strategies have been little used in sport.1 
93 
Two recent systematic reviews concluded that psychological intervention strategies 
94 
have the potential to reduce injury risk in broad populations of athletes.24,25 However, both 
95 
reviews excluded studies that did not provide information that would allow them to complete 
96 
the targeted statistical analyses.24,25 However, in the two previous systematic reviews, studies 
97 
were excluded if they were not underpinned by the Model of Stress and Athletic Injury.25 
98 
Consequently, these reviews may have excluded relevant evidence,3 and this could have 
99 
implications for clinical decision making.26  
100 
 5 
 
In addition, the focus of both the most recent reviews has been evaluating the efficacy 
101 
of psychological interventions, rather than their effectiveness. This is important as the 
102 
effectiveness of systematic injury prevention involves examining efficacy, efficiency and 
103 
compliance27,28 (see Box 1 for key terms). Knowledge of intervention effectiveness will 
104 
enhance understanding of sport psychology interventions in real-world environments.29 
105 
Consequently, the research question for this systematic review was: What is the effectiveness 
106 
of psychological intervention for preventing sports injuries? 
107 
 
108 
METHOD 
109 
Reporting for the current systematic review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for 
110 
Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines.30 The protocol was registered 
111 
in the PROSPERO database in February 2016 (registration number: CRD42016035879), and 
112 
was granted ethical approval by the Leeds Beckett University ethics committee (Application 
113 
Ref: 18124). 
114 
Search Strategy 
115 
Relevant articles were identified through a search of the following electronic 
116 
databases: CINAHL, MEDLINE, PsycARTICLES, PsycINFO, SPORTDiscus, Science 
117 
Box 1: Key terms 
Adherence: The voluntary, collaborative and active involvement of an athlete in an injury 
prevention programme that is mutually acceptable to the athlete and clinician. 
Compliance: The degree to which a participant conforms to the recommended dosage, timing and 
frequency of an intervention. The athlete is often passive in the process.  
Efficacy: The performance of an intervention under controlled conditions (e.g. a purposefully 
selected sample in artificially controlled game conditions), with greater potential to claim a high 
degree of internal validity. 
Efficiency: The pragmatic considerations (e.g. time requirements, financial implications or 
administrative requirements) of using an intervention 
Effectiveness: A more ‘real-world’ consideration, jointly determined by efficacy, efficiency and 
compliance/adherence, with greater potential to claim a high degree of external validity 
 
 6 
 
Direct and PubMed. Updated searches were completed for dates between the earliest 
118 
publications available on each database and 5th February 2017 
119 
The specific search strategy that was used for this review was: (sport injur* OR 
120 
athletic injur* ) AND ( intervention* OR strateg* OR prevention ) AND ( psychology OR 
121 
psychosocial factor OR psychosocial ) AND ( risk factors OR determinants OR predictor). 
122 
Relevant MeSH terms were added to these keywords to improve the accuracy of the literature 
123 
discovered. Peer-reviewed journals in sport psychology (Journal of Applied Sport 
124 
Psychology, The Sport Psychologist, Psychology of Sport and Exercise, the Journal of Sport 
125 
and Exercise Psychology, the International Journal of Sport and Exercise Psychology and the 
126 
International Journal of Sport Psychology) were also hand-searched. 
127 
The use and reporting of citation searching and bibliographic screening has gained 
128 
support as a powerful complementary method to keyword searching.31,32 Consequently, to 
129 
identify additional studies for the review, backward citation searching of bibliographies of all 
130 
included studies and forward citation searching via Google Scholar and Web of Science were 
131 
conducted to determine any additional studies. 
132 
Selection Criteria 
133 
The specific eligibility criteria for this review can be found in Table 1. The studies 
134 
included: randomised controlled trials (RCTs), non-randomised intervention studies that 
135 
included a comparison group, before and after study designs, and qualitative methods.3,33 
136 
Studies were required to outline specific psychosocial interventions used in relation to 
137 
reducing injury risk. 
138 
When applying the selection criteria, the title and abstract of each study were 
139 
reviewed first. If it was unclear from this whether the article should be included, the full text 
140 
was obtained and read for review. Three reviewers applied the selection criteria at each step 
141 
independently; any disagreements were resolved by consensus.3  
142 
 7 
 
Assessing risk of bias 
143 
The Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool (MMAT)26 was used to appraise the included 
144 
studies. This tool has high inter-rater reliability (0.72 – 0.94) 26 and contains five sets of 
145 
criteria: (1) qualitative; (2) randomised controlled studies – quantitative; (3) non-randomised 
146 
controlled studies – quantitative; (4) observational descriptive studies – quantitative; (5) 
147 
mixed-method studies. Each study type is judged in its methodological domain apart from 
148 
mixed-method studies, which are appraised using three sets: the qualitative set, the relevant 
149 
quantitative set and mixed-method set.26 The overall quality of a mixed-method study cannot 
150 
exceed its weakest component.  
151 
Establishing rigour 
152 
The MMAT appraisal criteria were applied independently by three reviewers to 
153 
rigorously appraise included studies. Inter-researcher reliability of appraisals was assessed 
154 
using a two-way mixed, absolute agreement intra-class correlation coefficient34 and 
155 
demonstrated high inter researcher reliability in independent study appraisal (0.98). Any 
156 
disagreements were resolved via consensus discussion. Consistent with recent reviews,3, 33,35 
157 
risk of bias was viewed on the continuum: 0-25% = high risk of bias, 25 – 50% = high to 
158 
moderate risk of bias, 50 – 75% = moderate to low risk of bias, and 75% - 100% = low risk of 
159 
bias. The theory behind this is that achieving the fewest MMAT criteria demonstrates the 
160 
highest risk of bias and achieving more MMAT criteria reduces the risk of bias.3,26 
161 
Data extraction and synthesis 
162 
AG, EM and DF independently extracted the following: operational definition of 
163 
injury, population, sample size, sex, ethnicity, nationality, intervention used, duration of 
164 
intervention, compliance rates, results of the study. Given heterogeneity of research designs, 
165 
populations, interventions and comparator groups, we used best evidence synthesis to 
166 
summarise the evidence by intervention type (e.g. stress inoculation training) or purpose (e.g. 
167 
 8 
 
relaxation) where possible. Risk of bias was assessed for each intervention type/purpose. 
168 
Evaluation of the overall effectiveness of interventions was based on three areas: (a) efficacy; 
169 
(b) efficiency; and (c) compliance28.   
170 
RESULTS 
171 
The electronic database search yielded 6160 records. An additional 193 records were 
172 
identified through table of contents searches, 9 through bibliographic searching and 4 through 
173 
forward citation searching (Figure 1). Titles of 6308 records were screened after duplicates 
174 
(n=58) were removed, and 6284 were excluded through title and abstract screening. Twenty-
175 
four articles were screened in full-text, and 11 were excluded (Figure 1), leaving 13 articles, 
176 
incorporating 14 studies. Supplementary table 1 presents a descriptive overview of data 
177 
extracted from final included articles. 
178 
Demographic characteristics 
179 
The 14 included studies reported on 1380 athletes, aged 10-33 years (mean = 18.6 
180 
years, SD = 2.8). Twelve articles (n=1355 participants) reported the number of male (n=868; 
181 
64.2%) and female (n=484; 35.8%) participants. One article,36 reporting two separate studies, 
182 
did not provide sufficient demographic information about their participants to include them in 
183 
this initial descriptive analysis. Participants’ level of competition ranged from international to 
184 
regional levels in floorball (54.1%); football (32.4%); rugby union and rugby league (3.5%); 
185 
gymnastics (3.2%); rowing (2.5%); ballet (2.5%); and swimming (1.8%).  
186 
Study characteristics 
187 
There were nine quantitative randomised, three quantitative non-randomised and one 
188 
quantitative descriptive studies (Table 2). There was a broad range of definitions of sports 
189 
injury across the studies. These included a time-loss definition of sports injury ranging from 
190 
one day37,38 to four days39 of restricted or no practice before being recorded as an injury, 
191 
whereas others did not overtly define an injury beyond anything requiring treatment.18,36  
192 
 9 
 
Risk of bias assessment 
193 
The MMAT rating of included studies (Table 2) ranged from 0% - 100% (mean = 
194 
51.9%, SE=7.73; 95% CI= 35.1 – 68.8), denoting an overall moderate risk of bias. The risk of 
195 
bias was mainly increased by studies not adequately reporting processes of randomisation 
196 
and/or allocation concealment and/or blinding (n=8), or not providing sufficient information 
197 
to be able to determine whether participant selection had minimised selection bias (n=3).  
198 
Effectiveness of psychosocial interventions for injury prevention 
199 
Stress management and relaxation were the most common interventions.18,36,41-45 
200 
Intervention techniques were imagery,36 goal setting,36,37,40, mindfulness, Acceptance and 
201 
Commitment (MAC) training,39 attribution training,37 self-confidence training,37,40 autogenic 
202 
training,38 self-talk,38 thought stopping,43,44 abdominal breathing,43 control of emotions,36,40 
203 
concentration skills,40 and video clips.44 Video-based training was also used as a standalone 
204 
awareness training programme.46 
205 
Efficacy  
206 
Thirteen out of the 14 studies reviewed reported fewer injuries and/or shorter time-
207 
loss in the intervention group than the control group. Twelve out of 14 studies had a control 
208 
group to compare the effectiveness of their intervention. Interventions in these studies 
209 
demonstrated a range of effect sizes on reduction in injuries, from small (d = 0.2) to large (d 
210 
= 1.21). Supplementary table 1 provides a study-by-study breakdown of intervention 
211 
efficacy. 
212 
Efficiency  
213 
The duration of interventions ranged from 4 weeks to 8 months (mean =15.6 weeks, 
214 
SD =10.75). The number of intervention sessions varied from 6 to 160 (mean = 10.9, SD = 
215 
9.4). The duration of the individual intervention sessions ranged from 10 to 120 minutes 
216 
(mean =50 minutes, SD =28.4). The most frequent duration of an intervention session was 
217 
 10 
 
one hour.40-46 There was evidence from studies at low risk of bias that up to 2 sessions per 
218 
week, for 3-6 weeks on interventions based on principles of stress inoculation training was 
219 
effective (d=0.2-0.99) for reducing sports injuries.40,41,47 
220 
Compliance 
221 
Compliance rates were largely unreported. In 1 study, there was compliance of 82% 
222 
for a coping intervention and 83% for an autogenic training intervention.38 
223 
Best evidence synthesis 
224 
There was evidence with a moderate risk of bias (M=50%) from five studies that 
225 
stress inoculation training was effective at reducing injuries. There was evidence with a high 
226 
risk of bias (M=8.3%) from three studies that relaxation training was effective at reducing 
227 
injuries. There was evidence with a low risk of bias (M=75%) from three studies that 
228 
multipurpose interventions (e.g. combination of stress management, concentration, 
229 
confidence and emotional control training) were effective at reducing injuries.  
230 
DISCUSSION 
231 
The research question addressed through this systematic review was: What is the 
232 
effectiveness of psychological intervention for preventing sports injuries? The purposes of 
233 
the following discussion are to (1) discuss findings relating to efficacy, efficiency and 
234 
compliance and the associated practical recommendations that can be drawn; (2) discuss the 
235 
methodological quality of studies; and (3) present future research directions.   
236 
Psychological interventions are associated with reductions in injury rates 
 
237 
Thirteen out of the 14 studies reviewed reported fewer injuries and/or shorter time-
238 
loss, with small to large effects (d 0.2 to 1.21) of psychological interventions for reducing 
239 
injury rates and/or time loss. Psychological interventions are efficient, given the low weekly 
240 
time requirement and the low number of weeks taken to complete interventions. Therefore, 
241 
 11 
 
practitioners may wish to consider psychosocial interventions as part of their interdisciplinary 
242 
injury prevention programmes.24,25  
243 
 
There are different plausible explanations for the efficacy of psychological 
244 
interventions. Most contained a stress management component, and stress is associated with 
245 
injury risk.22,25 Periods of high stress influence cortisol and oxytocin release, which may have 
246 
a relationship to injury risk48, 49 via immune50,51 and pain49 responses. Stress management 
247 
interventions can have a beneficial effect on these immune and pain responses.18,36,40-43,47 
248 
Reduced stress levels are also associated with reduced amydgala activation.25 This may 
249 
reduce injury risk as it is associated with improved attention and decision-making 
250 
capacity.25,39 This is important as decreased attention and decision-making ability is linked 
251 
with increased injury risk.52 Moreover, elevated stress can impact on neurocognitive 
252 
functioning and decrease neuromuscular control, which is linked with non-contact ACL 
253 
injuries.53 Stress Inoculation Training54 is a progressive multi-modal stress reduction 
254 
technique prominent in this review. It aims to reduce tension and increase attention, which 
255 
have both been linked with increased injury risk.25,39  
256 
Methodological quality of included studies 
257 
Overall, the body of evidence shows a moderate risk of bias (52%). The lack of clarity 
258 
over processes for concealment or blinding, difficulties over assessing dropout rates, and 
259 
difficulties in assessing a lack of bias in sampling procedures, all contributed to this (see table 
260 
2). Most studies had a small sample size and few provided evidence of sample size 
261 
estimation. This calls into question the statistical power of the studies,55,56 and draws potential 
262 
concerns over the reproducibility of the findings.57 There is also a lack of replication research 
263 
within this field. 57 The definition of injuries varied across studies, ranging from no 
264 
definition36 to varying time-loss definitions.40 This makes it difficult to accurately assess the 
265 
effectiveness of different interventions.   
266 
 12 
 
There was a substantial under-representation of female athletes within included 
267 
studies. Injury is a major contributor to retirement in female athletes.2 Therefore, more 
268 
research is required to determine whether psychological interventions may be beneficial to 
269 
female athletes. The under-representation of female athletes also calls into question the 
270 
application of research findings to female athletes.2,3,33  
271 
Practical implications 
272 
Wampold58 noted that the factors of goal collaboration, empathy, alliance and 
273 
therapist effects all had greater effect sizes on treatment intervention than treatment 
274 
differences.  Therefore, sports injury practitioners (SIPs) contemplating psychologically-
275 
based interventions for injury prevention should consider creating a strong alliance with their 
276 
athletes founded on a strong bond, reaching agreement about the goals of the therapy, and 
277 
reaching agreement about the type of intervention, as these ‘alliance’ factors are likely to 
278 
increase the effectiveness of the selected intervention.59 Many SIPs will recognise issue with 
279 
limitations of practice when considering including psychological interventions for injury 
280 
prevention. Box 260 provides details of professional organisations that SIPs may contact, to 
281 
access appropriate sport psychology professionals. 
282 
 
283 
Future research directions 
284 
 Replication research is needed to confirm and extend existing clinical 
285 
recommendations.57 Using established protocols such as Gardner and Moore’s61 MAC 
286 
programme, which has demonstrated clinically meaningful effect size (d=0.59) in reducing 
287

injury risk39 makes the potential for wider replication research greater. Given the 
288 
multifactorial nature of injury mechanisms,8 we would encourage multidisciplinary working 
289 
between SIPs and sport psychology practitioners in future injury prevention research.  
290 
 Examining the effectiveness of less represented psychological intervention strategies 
291 
(e.g. imagery training) would advance the research area. Imagery may reduce injury risk for a 
292 
number of reasons. It can result in neuromuscular patterning which innervates targeted 
293 
muscles in similar ways to physically performing movements. 62,63 Well-trained imagers have 
294 
MRI-confirmed neurological activation that reflects actual movements.64,65 There is also an 
295 
increase in muscle activity following sports imagery training.66 Finally, imagery may act as a 
296 
coding mechanism by which athletes process and learn optimal movement patterns.67  
297 
Scant research in this review has delineated between traumatic and overuse injuries. 
298 
This is important as the relationship between psychosocial stress and overuse injury is 
299 
potentially stronger than for traumatic injuries, because of the associated physiological and 
300 
behavioural outcomes of psychosocial stress. For example, a behaviour such as altered sleep 
301 
that can accompany psychosocial stress is associated with elevated evening cortisol levels 
302 
and supressed human growth hormone release, both of which may inhibit muscle repair post-
303 
exercise.23 In addition, behavioural considerations such as compliance or adherence with 
304 
injury prevention programmes28 and neglecting recovery strategies68 are also likely to 
305 
increase the risk of overuse injuries. Consequently, future injury prevention studies would 
306 
benefit from examining the role of behaviour change strategies in reducing overuse injuries.  
307 
Strengths and limitations of this review 
308 
 
The inclusive nature of the review to evaluate the overall published evidence base has 
309 
likely provided a fuller picture of the existing evidence.3 Considering each facet of 
310 
effectiveness (efficacy, efficiency and compliance) as opposed to efficacy alone has also 
311 
provided new insight into the body of research which has the potential for real-world 
312 
 14 
 
application of findings29 and is a shift in thinking from previous reviews conducted in this 
313

The inclusion criteria for this review stipulated peer-reviewed articles only, meaning 
315 
that grey literature was not included. There is debate over the appropriateness of including 
316 
grey literature in systematic reviews, with some suggestions that unpublished studies may 
317 
enhance the findings of systematic reviews.69 However, this recommendation is often due to 
318 
publication bias whereby studies which demonstrate statistical significance and/or large 
319 
effects are more likely to be published.  
320 
 
The search combinations used may also be considered limiting, given their strict 
321 
nature, and may have increased the risk of relevant literature being missed. For example, not 
322 
including specific intervention types (e.g. stress inoculation training) with ‘injur*’ may have 
323 
increased the chances of relevant studies being missed. Equally, by using the terms ‘sport 
324 
injur* OR athletic injur*’, this may have increased the risk of unintentionally excluding any 
325 
studies which named specific injuries within the abstract (e.g. ACL rupture, hamstring 
326 
strains). To address this, we used table of contents searches, forward citation searching and 
327 
backward citation searching to supplement the electronic database search.  
328 
Conclusions 
329 
Psychological interventions, particularly those with a stress reduction focus such as 
330 
Stress Inoculation Training, are efficient and efficacious methods of reducing sports injury 
331 
rates and injury time-loss.   Future investigators should be mindful of ensuring that sample 
332 
sizes, statistical power and reproducibility of findings are planned for, and that appropriate 
333 
reporting of processes of randomisation and reporting mechanisms for minimising selection 
334 
bias takes place.
