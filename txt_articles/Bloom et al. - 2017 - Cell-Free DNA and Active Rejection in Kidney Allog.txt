possibility, we prospectively collected blood specimens at scheduled intervals and at the time of clinically indicated

rejection status ascertained by histology in 107 biopsy specimens. The dd-cfDNA level discriminated between
biopsy specimens showing any rejection (T cell–mediated rejection or antibody-mediated rejection [ABMR]) and
controls (no rejection histologically), P,0.001 (receiver operating characteristic area under the curve [AUC], 0.74;

cfDNA may be used to assess allograft rejection and injury; dd-cfDNA levels ,1% reflect the absence of active
rejection (T cell–mediated type $IB or ABMR) and levels .1% indicate a probability of active rejection.

 Accurate and timely detection of allograft rejection and effec-
tive treatment are essential for long-term survival of renal
transplants. Although histology obtained via needle biopsy
remains the standard for diagnosis of rejection, this technique
is infrequently used for surveillance because of the cost, logis-
tics, potential complications, and patient discomfort and
inconvenience. Donor-derived cell-free DNA (dd-cfDNA) de-
tected in the blood of transplant recipients has been proposed
as a noninvasive marker for diagnosis of graft rejection.1–3 The
premise for quantitative interpretation of this biomarker is
that rejection entails injury, including increased cell death in
the allograft, leading to increased dd-cfDNA released into the
bloodstream.
Data from several single-center studies suggest that
dd-cfDNA levels in blood, measured as a fraction of the total
cell-free DNA (cfDNA), can discriminate rejection from non-
rejection in heart, lung, liver, and kidney allografts. In stable
heart transplant recipients, the fraction of cfDNA originating
from the graft is nearly always ,1%,4–6 whereas during re-
jection the levels of dd-cfDNA are significantly higher.5,7 In
stable lung and liver transplant recipients, the level of dd-
cfDNA is higher than in stable heart transplant recipients,
and it further increases in moderate-to-severe rejection.8,9
Up to now, dd-cfDNA has been least studied in renal trans-
plants; levels in stable kidney recipients are similar to those in
heart transplant recipients,4,10 and analyses of individual pa-
tients and a small single-center study identified higher levels
during biopsy-proven acute rejection.11
In kidney transplantation, there are no existing biomarkers
that adequately measure the status of active injury to the allo-
graft. Serum creatinine allows estimation of the GFR, but it is
not specific or sensitive for allograft injury, and may not dis-
tinguish acute from chronic loss of function.12,13
This report from the Circulating Donor-Derived Cell-Free
DNAinBloodforDiagnosingAcuteRejectioninKidneyTrans-
plant Recipients (DART) study (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier:
NCT02424227) validates that plasma levels of dd-cfDNA can
discriminate active rejection status. The DARTstudy is the first
multicenter study of renal allograft recipients using an analyt-
ically validated dd-cfDNA test7 that employs targeted ampli-
fication and sequencing of single-nucleotide polymorphisms
to quantify donor and recipient DNA contributions, with-
out the need for prior genotyping of donor or recipient
DNA (AlloSure).
RESULTS
Patients, Biopsies, and Blood Samples
From April of 2015 until May of 2016, 384 renal transplant
patients were enrolled (245 within 1–3 months of their kidney
transplantation and 139 at the time of a clinically indicated
renal biopsy) from 14 clinical sites. Figures 1 and 2 show the
pathologists’ diagnostic findings for the 107 clinically indi-
cated biopsies that had matched plasma dd-cfDNA results.
This subset provides the core dataset used for the analyses of
dd-cfDNA to discriminate rejection from no rejection status
(using the biopsy-based pathologists’ reports as the diagnostic
standard).
The patient characteristics of the study cohort are shown in
Table 1. The DARTstudy population was representative of the
United States renal transplant registry population (Supple-
mental Table 1). The active rejection subgroup contained a
higher proportion of black and deceased donor organ recipi-
ents than the group without active rejection and the overall
DART population. Patients with active rejection were also sig-
nificantly younger than patients with no rejection.
At the time of data lock, 219 patients had at least one renal
biopsy; 242 biopsies had sufficient specimens and associated
pathologists’ reported results (Figure 2). The majority of bi-
opsies (204 of 242) were performed for clinical suspicion of
rejection, 34 for surveillance, and four for follow-up of treated
rejection. Only one of 34 (3%) surveillance biopsies revealed
rejection (Supplemental Table 2). Therefore, we did not
calculate the performance characteristics for dd-cfDNA to dis-
criminate active rejection in the scenario of no clinical indi-
cation for biopsy.
Our primary analyses in this study combined three sub-
classes of rejection (T cell–mediated rejection [TCMR],
“acute/active” antibody-mediated rejection [ABMR], and
“chronic, active” ABMR) defined by the Banff working
groups14,15 because they share some common histologic cri-
teria and the related cell injury manifestations have potential
to involve active cell injury and death,16 and therefore result in
increased levels of dd-cfDNA (Supplemental Figure 1). We use
the term active rejection to describe these rejection subclasses
and distinguish them from all other biopsy-based diagnoses
not phenotypically associated with active rejection (details in
Concise Methods).
Adiagnosis of active rejectionwas confirmed in review of 59
pathologists’ biopsy reports: 58 cases of active rejection in 204
biopsies, performed for clinical suspicion, most commonly an
elevation in serum creatinine, and one case of active rejection
in 34 surveillance biopsies. The types of active rejection are
summarized in Supplemental Table 2.
dd-cfDNA Levels in Blood Plasma
To define the area under the curve–receiver operating charac-
teristic (AUC-ROC) performance of dd-cfDNA, we included
all dd-cfDNA results that were collected at the same time that a
clinically indicated biopsy was performed. There were 27 bi-
opsy specimens from 27 patients with, and 80 biopsy speci-
mens from 75 patients without, active rejection. A correlation
matrix of Banff elementary lesions and clinical features for the
107 samples are rank-ordered and color-coded by dd-cfDNA
level in Figure 1. Samples with .1% dd-cfDNA occurred sig-
nificantly more often (P,0.01) in the following types of re-
jection and subelements: acute/active ABMR; chronic, active
ABMR; any or moderate microvascular inflammation;
linear C4d staining in peritubular capillaries; and presence

 of donor-specific antibody. The dd-cfDNA threshold of 1%
also discriminated type IB TCMR (P=0.01) and transplant
glomerulopathy (P=0.03). We computed the AUC-ROC per-
formance of serum creatinine on this set. For estimating the
positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value
(NPV) of dd-cfDNAto predict active rejection versus no active
rejection, we used the prevalence of 58 active rejections in the
170 patients with 204 biopsy reports available from clinically
indicated biopsies (Figure 2).
The fraction of dd-cfDNA in blood plasma differed signif-
icantly between the groups (Figure 3A). The median level of
dd-cfDNA in patients with active rejection was significantly
higher (1.6%) than in the comparator group (0.3%) of biopsy
specimens without active rejection (P,0.001). Median dd-
cfDNA levels varied by type of active rejection: 2.9%
(ABMR), 1.2% (TCMR only, types IB and IIA), 0.2%
(TCMR only type IA). Because of small numbers, comparison
of TCMR types included the cases of mixed TCMR and
ABMR. Figure 4B shows the data for TCMR $types IB
(P=0.05 versus no active rejection) and TCMR type IA.
The fractions of true and false positive results for dd-cfDNA
to discriminate active rejection are shown in Figure 3C. The
area under the curve (AUC) was 0.74 (95% confidence interval
[95% CI], 0.61 to 0.86). With a cutoff of 1.0%, dd-cfDNA had
an 85% specificity (95% CI, 79% to 91%) and 59% sensitivity
(95% CI, 44% to 74%) to discriminate active rejection from
no rejection. This is graphed as the sensitivity and specificity
over the range of dd-cfDNA (Figure 3E). The range of PPVand
NPV for dd-cfDNA for discriminating active rejection is
shown in Figure 3F; the PPV was 61% and NPV was 84%,
with the 1.0% dd-cfDNA cutoff.
Serum creatinine at time of biopsy did not discriminate
active rejection from no active rejection (Figure 3B). The
ROC curve for creatinine to discriminate active rejection
had an AUC of 0.54 (95% CI, 0.43 to 0.66); i.e., at any cut-
off level for creatinine, there were as many false as true positive
results (Figure 3D).
When the cohort of ABMR (including mixed ABMR and
TCMR) was compared with the cohort of all non-ABMR (in-
cluding TCMR-only), the fraction of dd-cfDNA differed
significantly (P,0.001, Figure 5A), whereas there was no dis-
crimination by serum creatinine (Figure 5B). The fraction of
true positive results and the fraction of false positive results for
dd-cfDNA to discriminate ABMR status are shown in Figure
5C. The AUC was 0.87 (95% CI, 0.75 to 0.97). With a cutoff of
1.0%, dd-cfDNA has an 83% specificity (95% CI, 78% to 89%)
and 81% sensitivity (95% CI, 67% to 100%) to discriminate
ABMR from no ABMR. The sensitivity and specificity to
Figure 1. Banff elementary lesions and clinical features correlate with dd-cfDNA level. The 107 samples (27 patients with 27 samples

 discriminate ABMR over the range of potential cutoffs is
shown in Figure 5E. The range of PPV and NPV for discrim-
inating ABMR is shown in Figure 5F; the PPV was 44% and
NPV was 96% with the 1.0% dd-cfDNA cutoff. The ROC
curve for creatinine to discriminate ABMR had an AUC of
0.57 (95% CI, 0.42 to 0.71) (Figure 5D).
Among the 58 active rejections found in the clinically in-
dicated biopsies, the available 27 paired dd-cfDNA results are
shown in Figure 4A, broken out by rejection subclass: ten were
chronic, active ABMR; six acute/active ABMR; and 11 TCMR
only (types IA [5], IB [5], and IIA [1]). As shown, the lowest
types of TCMR (type IA) had lower dd-cfDNA than type IB or
type IIA (Figure 4B), although the number of cases was very
limited. The similarity in the pattern of dd-cfDNA values in
the nominal two classes of ABMR was not surprising, because
the histologic criteria overlap for these forms of ABMR. Figure
6 shows the dd-cfDNA results in the same 27 cases of active
rejection, categorized by other findings in addition to histo-
logic evidence of active rejection. For comparison, Figure 7
shows the results in the 80 biopsy specimens with no rejection,
categorized by other histologic findings. In both the active
rejection and no active rejection groups, interstitial fibrosis/
tubular atrophy (IF/TA) and acute tubular necrosis were rel-
atively common coincidental findings, and no obvious trend
in the dd-cfDNA was associated with these. Because of the
small number of cases of these other diagnoses, including cal-
cineurin inhibitor (CNI) toxicity and BK virus (BKV), statis-
tical analyses of these patterns were not performed.
Of 80 clinically indicated biopsies with no active rejection
findings, only nine biopsy specimens were reported to show
essentially normal histology (i.e., no other coincidental find-
ings, such as IF/TA, acute tubular necrosis, BKV, GN, CNI
toxicity). We performed a comparison of dd-cfDNA in the
group of the normal biopsy specimens to the biopsy specimens
showing no active rejection but one or more coincidental find-
ings: in the normal group (n=9) the median dd-cfDNA was
0.53% (interquartile range, 0.22%–0.67%); in the coinciden-
tal finding group (n=71), the median dd-cfDNA was
0.30% (interquartile range, 0.14%–0.77%) (Wilcoxon rank
sum test P=0.9).
Among the 107 biopsy specimens in either the active re-
jection or no active rejection groups, there were two reports in
Figure 2. Patients, blood samples, and biopsies used in this study.

 whichthepathologists noted findingsofpapillomaBKvirus.In
case one, there was a viral load of .2 million copies of BKV/ml
blood, and inflammation equivalent to Banff 1B intensity (i2–
3, t3). In case two, there was moderate IF/TA and 9.99 million
copies of BKV/ml blood. The dd-cfDNA level was 4.6% and
2.3%, respectively, in these cases.
DISCUSSION
In thisstudy,most(204 of 242) kidney transplant biopsieswere
triggered byanelevation in serum creatinine over baseline with
concerns for alloimmune injury, yet only 27% of these clini-
cally indicated biopsies revealed active rejection. The results in
the 107 biopsy specimens paired with plasma cfDNA showed
that dd-cfDNA levels discriminated an active rejection status
with an ROC-AUC of 0.74 and provided an estimated NPV
84% and PPV 61% at a cutoff of 1.0% dd-cfDNA. These results
validated and extended prior reports of the performance char-
acteristics of this assay.7 There was stronger performance of
dd-cfDNA in discriminating ABMR from no ABMR allograft
status (ROC-AUC 0.87, NPV 96%, PPV 44%, cutoff of 1.0%
dd-cfDNA). dd-cfDNA in 16 cases of ABMR was significantly
higher (2.9%) than in 11 cases of TCMR rejection (0.2% in
type IA [five patients], 1.2% in combined type IB [five pa-
tients] and type IIA [one patient]), and 0.3% in the no active
rejection cohort (n=80). Because there is a clear trend that dd-
cfDNA was higher in type IB TCMR than in type IA, we spec-
ulate that dd-cfDNA is likely to be higher in the more severe
types of TCMR, but this cohort did not have enough cases to
test this hypothesis.
The elevation of dd-cfDNA (.1%) was significantly asso-
ciated with acute/active and chronic, active ABMR (Figure 1).
The dd-cfDNA levels across the threshold of 1% also

 associated with type IB TCMR and transplant glomerulop-
athy. With the limited number of rejection events and intrinsic
coupling to Banff histopathology subelements, we are unable
to discern any obvious subelement (e.g., microvascular in-
flammation) that may be more strongly associated with ele-
vation of dd-cfDNA. This dd-cfDNA assay, which does not
involve a biopsy and can be easily measured in a sequential
manner, has potential to provide additional information along
with de novo DSA in the diagnosis, management, and treat-
ment of ABMR.
In contrast to dd-cfDNA, the serum creatinine level did not
provide any discrimination of active rejection or ABMR from
absence of active rejection or ABMR in the context of clinical
indication for biopsy, because the creatinine ROC-AUC was
near 0.50 (and the lower boundary of the 95th percentile
confidence interval was well under 0.50 [Figure 3D and
Figure 5D]).
Two cases of BKV were examples that demonstrate dd-
cfDNA, by itself, may not be able to distinguish injury associ-
ated with the interstitial inflammation and tubulitis caused by
BKVfromsimilardegreesofinflammationandtubulitiscaused
by TCMR, but support the tenet that an elevation in dd-cfDNA
may be used to reveal the degree of active allograft injury. A
secondary method, most likely including a renal biopsy, will be
needed to confirm the type of rejection or other injury. The
observation that BKV is associated with the development of
de novo DSA17 raises the possibility that an elevation in
dd-cfDNA in the setting of this infection could represent
alloantibody-mediated microcirculation injury. Future stud-
ies will be required to illuminate the relationship among
DSA, BKV, and dd-cfDNA elevation.
Scheduled surveillance needle biopsy evaluation for renal
allograftrejectionorothercausesofinjuryislimitedbecauseits
risks and costs versus benefits remain controversial.18 In our
study, only three of the 14 DART centers had surveillance bi-
opsy protocols, accounting for 34 of 260 biopsies, and only
one low-type TCMR was observed. This confirms other mul-
ticenter findings that protocol biopsies may not be useful be-
cause not enough reversible pathology is found.18 Because we
observed that, at the time of diagnosis of active rejection, me-
dian dd-cfDNA was 2.9% and 1.2% for ABMR and TCMR
type $IB, respectively, it is reasonable to infer that serial mea-
surements showing increases in dd-cfDNA may be useful to
detect onset of a new rejection or other injury. Because the dd-
cfDNA assay may be practical to repeat monthly (or more
often), the stability of the biomarker below threshold levels
could also be useful to guide the short- and long-term tapering
or maintenance of immunosuppression medications. The
half-life of cfDNA in the blood is ,1 hour,19 so changes in
dd-cfDNA are expected to be a dynamic indicator of graft
damage. The dd-cfDNA biomarker, in contrast to creatinine,
may be a measure of cell injury in the allograft. The magnitude
of increase in dd-cfDNA may be proportional to the acuity and
severity of injury, akin to cardiac enzyme creatine phospho-
kinase or cardiac myocyte–specific protein troponin, which
have been established as biomarkers of acute heart injury.20
Strengths of this dd-cfDNA study, which establishes the
performance characteristics, include (1) an analytically vali-
dated assay in a College of American Pathologists-accredited,
Clinical Laboratories Improvements Act (CLIA)–certified ref-
erence laboratory7; (2) the largest prospective, multicenter
observational study of this test in renal transplant recipients;
(3) a study population representative of United States renal
transplant recipients; and (4) histopathology reports used as
the reference to categorize rejection status.
There are several limitations to the study. First, we were not
able to estimate the performance of dd-cfDNA to discriminate
active rejection or ABMR in patients who may have had sub-
clinical rejection because there were only 34 surveillance bi-
opsies and only one finding of active rejection. However, this
low rejection frequency is consistent with reports by others in
an era of tacrolimus–mycophenolic acid–prednisone–based
maintenance immunosuppression that question the utility
of protocol biopsy for this purpose.18 Second, the number of
active rejections (27) and subclasses of rejection observed
among these biopsy specimens was limited. However, these
met the target total number of rejections prospectively stated
in the statistical analysis, and indeed, the results proved this
number to be sufficient to demonstrate statistically significant
performance characteristics. Third, biopsy-matched blood
samples were not collected for all biopsy specimens, and
some of the matched blood samples were excluded due to
issues such as inadequate amount of total DNA or timing of
the blood draw relative to the biopsy. Of all collected blood
samples, 4.5% did not render results due to some aspect of
sample collection or testing. Most patients completed surveil-
lance visits in compliance (77%) with the center schedule.

 The optimal time interval for serial monitoring of dd-
cfDNA for surveillance remains to be defined, but monthly
would be feasible, because established clinical laboratory tests
such as creatinine are measured on a monthlyor more frequent
schedule. Additionally, this test may be ordered if there is a
clinical suspicion of rejection or injury, before deciding on the
need for a renal biopsy. This would be especially useful in
patients who are on anticoagulation therapy or have other
reasons to avoid biopsy. As with all laboratory tests, clinical
assessment of the patient’s context is important when inter-
preting results. Although the dd-cfDNA test may not eliminate
the need for biopsy, results with high PPV could increase the
prebiopsy probability of detecting treatable injury, so that bi-
opsy could be made an even more effective diagnostic tool. In
association with a high NPV, dd-cfDNA results may reduce the
need for biopsy in some cases of elevated creatinine.

CONCISE METHODS
Study Design
The DART study was a prospective observational study. Renal trans-
plant patients were enrolled within 1–3 months of their kidney trans-
plantation and/or at the time of a clinically indicated renal biopsy
from 14 clinical sites (Supplemental Table 3, Participating Sites).
The institutional review board at each site approved the study, and
all of the patients provided written informed consent. The statistical
analysis, data management, and clinical operations coordinationwere
provided by staff employed by the study sponsor.
Blood Samples and dd-cfDNA Measurement
After transplantation, blood was collected at the time of scheduled
surveillancevisitsatmonths1,2,3,4,6,9,and12;oratthetimeofeach
kidney allograft biopsy and up to two follow-up samples within 8
weeks of the kidney allograft biopsy. Duplicate samples of venous
blood were collected at the same venipuncture in Streck Cell-Free
DNA BCT tubes, stored at room temperature, and shipped to the
CLIA-certified laboratory at CareDx, Inc. (Brisbane, CA). Upon
arrival, and within 7 days postdraw,21 plasma was separated by cen-
trifugation at 1600 3 g for 20 minutes followed by a second centri-
fugation at 16,000 3 g for 10 minutes and was either stored at 280°C
or cfDNA was extracted immediately using the Circulating Nucleic
Acid kit (Qiagen, Redwood City, CA).
We measured dd-cfDNA using a targeted next-generation se-
quencing assay that employs 266 single-nucleotide polymor-
phisms to accurately quantify dd-cfDNA in transplant recipients
withoutneed forseparategenotypingof therecipientor thedonor.7
The assay quantifies the fraction of dd-cfDNA in both unrelated
and related donor-recipient pairs. The dd-cfDNA assay is precise
across the linear quantifiable range (0.2%–16% dd-cfDNA) with a
mean across-run coefficient of variation of 6.8%.7 Assay results of
the clinical samples in this study were evaluated against estab-
lished quality control criteria described previously,7 and only
passing results used for analysis. Samples that failed quality con-
trol were repeated at the step where they failed or were repeated
using plasma from the duplicate Streck Cell-Free DNA BCT tube
collected at the same venipuncture as the first sample. All mea-
surements were performed by staff unaware of the identity of the
samples. The final results (percentage dd-cfDNA) were reported to
the database manager, who combined them with the clinical in-
formation and transferred the combined data set to the statistical
team for analysis.
Renal Allograft Biopsies
We collected information on the number of, and clinical indication
for,renaltransplantbiopsiesforeachpatient.Theon-sitepathologist’s
official renal transplant biopsy diagnostic report was used by the site
investigator to guide completion of the study case report form sec-
tions which captured the diagnosis of rejection in accordance with
criteria designated by the Banff Working Groups.14,15 The study clin-
ical monitor independently reviewed the pathologists’reports to con-
firm that the findings met the criteria defined in the Banff Working
Group classification system to support the recorded diagnostic clas-
sification, and final reconciled results were communicated with each
study center and used in the final analysis dataset supplied to the
study data manager.

 Classification of Rejection
Renal Allograft Rejection Histologic Diagnostic Nomenclature
and Rationale for Active Rejection Definition Used in the
Study Analyses of dd-cfDNA
The international classification schema includes two acute rejection
phenotypes: TCMR14 and acute/active ABMR.15 In the Banff 2013
report,15 there was recognition that intimal arteritis, which had been
solely a criteria for TCMR (types IIA, IIB, and III) in the Banff 2007
classification,14 can also be observed and is clinically impactful in
ABMR. This led these TCMR microvascular injury phenotypes to
be added to the histologic evidence criteria for acute/active ABMR:
“acute tissue injury, including one or more of the following: micro-
vascular inflammation, intimal or transmural arteritis, acute throm-
botic microangiopathy, or acute tubular injury.”22
In addition to “acute/active” ABMR, the international classification
system designates “chronic, active” ABMR. These two ABMR subclasses
have overlapping phenotypic criteria22: (1) evidence of current/recent
antibody interaction with vascular endothelium (linear C4d staining in
the peritubular capillaries, at least moderate microvascular inflamma-
tion, increased expression of endothelial activation, and injury tran-
scripts or other gene expression markers of endothelial injury), and
(2) serologic evidence of DSA. In practice, histologic findings observed
in a single renal biopsy specimen may qualify for diagnosis of both
acute/active and chronic, active ABMR and/or TCMR.16
Our primaryanalysesinthisstudycombinedthesethreesubclasses
of rejection defined by the Banff working groups14,15 because they
share common histologic criteria and the related cell injury manifes-
tations have potential to involve active cell injury and death16 and
therefore increased levels of dd-cfDNA (Supplemental Figure 1). We
use the term active rejection to describe these pooled classes of re-
jection. We combined these active rejection subclasses and distin-
guish them from all other biopsy-based diagnoses not phenotypically
associated with active rejection (e.g., IF/TA).
BANFF Working Group–Based Diagnostic Subcategories
Derived from Pathologists’ Reports of Renal Biopsy Findings
TCMR: Includes those biopsy reports which meet the Banff 2007
criteria14 for TCMR types IA, IIA, IB, IIB, or III.
Acute/active ABMR: Includes those biopsy reports which meet all
three requisite Banff 2013 acute/active ABMR criteria15 (i.e., histologic
evidence of acute tissue injury, evidence of current/recent antibody in-
teraction with vascular endothelium, and serologic evidence of DSA).
Chronic, active ABMR: Includes those biopsy reports which
meet all three requisite Banff 2013 criteria for chronic, active
ABMR (i.e., histologic morphologic evidence of chronic tissue injury,
evidence of current/recent antibody interaction with vascular endo-
thelium, and “at least moderate microvasculature inflammation
[(glomerulitis [g]+peritubular capillary inflammation [ptc]
scores)$2], and serologic evidence of DSA”).
The biopsy reports which diagnosed mixed ABMR and TCMR
were grouped together with the ABMR subgroup for purposes of
the analyses.
All other biopsy specimens not qualifying for any of the “active re-
jection” subclasses listed above were defined as the “no active rejection”
comparator group. These “no active rejection” biopsy specimens had
one or more of the following findings: no major findings, nonspecific
acute tubular necrosis (or “injury”), polyoma virus, CNI toxicity, GN,
IF/TA (grades I, II, or III); and TCMR “suspicious” or “borderline.”
The patients who did not undergo a renal biopsy due to clinical
suspicion have been analyzed in a separate report that characterized
the range of values of dd-cfDNA in the subset of DARTrenal allograft
patients who had stable graft function.
Statistical Analyses
The objective of the primary statistical analysis was to determine
whether the dd-cfDNA in a patient’s plasma can discriminate active
rejection from no active rejection allograft status in patients clinically
indicated for biopsy, as determined by pathologists’ renal biopsy
readings, as described above. The execution of these analyses was
triggered according to a prospective written plan which stated that
the analysis should begin when a nominal quota of 30 biopsy-proven
active rejection events had been accumulated in the database.
Secondary analyses included comparisons of dd-cfDNA perfor-
mance in discriminating biopsy-based diagnosis of ABMR from all
other samples that did not have biopsy evidence of ABMR.
We used the AUC, sensitivity, and specificity to evaluate the perfor-
mance of dd-cfDNA in discriminating the active rejection from the
comparator (no active rejection) status, using the biopsy-based, Banff
Working Group classification as the standard for true allograft rejection
status. The Emir method23 was used to account for multiple samples
from the same patient. We estimate PPV and NPV of dd-cfDNA in
predicting biopsy-based allograft active rejection in the patient. For
comparative purposes, we performed similar analyses to assess the per-
formance of serum creatinine in discriminating active rejection.
