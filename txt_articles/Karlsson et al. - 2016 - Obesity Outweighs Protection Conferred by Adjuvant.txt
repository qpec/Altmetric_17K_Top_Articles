ABSTRACT
Obesity is a risk factor for developing severe influenza virus infection, making vaccination of utmost importance for
this high-risk population. However, vaccinated obese animals and adults have decreased neutralizing antibody responses. In
these studies, we tested the hypothesis that the addition of either alum or a squalene-based adjuvant (AS03) to an influenza vac-
cine would improve neutralizing antibody responses and protect obese mice from challenge. Our studies demonstrate that adju-
vanted vaccine does increase both neutralizing and nonneutralizing antibody levels compared to vaccine alone. Although obese
mice mount significantly decreased virus-specific antibody responses, both the breadth and the magnitude of the responses
against hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) are decreased compared to the responses in lean mice. Importantly, even
with a greater than fourfold increase in neutralizing antibody levels, obese mice are not protected against influenza virus chal-
lenge and viral loads remain elevated in the respiratory tract. Increasing the antigen dose affords no added protection, and a de-
creasing viral dose did not fully mitigate the increased mortality seen in obese mice. Overall, these studies highlight that, while
the use of an adjuvant does improve seroconversion, vaccination does not fully protect obese mice from influenza virus chal-
lenge, possibly due to the increased sensitivity of obese animals to infection. Given the continued increase in the global obesity
epidemic, our findings have important implications for public health.
IMPORTANCE
Vaccination is the most effective strategy for preventing influenza virus infection and is a key component for pan-
demic preparedness. However, vaccines may fail to provide optimal protection in high-risk groups, including overweight and
obese individuals. Given the worldwide obesity epidemic, it is imperative that we understand and improve vaccine efficacy. No
work to date has investigated whether adjuvants increase the protective capacity of influenza vaccines in the obese host. In these
studies, we show that adjuvants increased the neutralizing and nonneutralizing antibody responses during vaccination of lean
and obese mice to levels considered “protective,” and yet, obese mice still succumbed to infection. This vulnerability is likely due
to a combination of factors, including the increased susceptibility of obese animals to develop severe and even lethal disease
when infected with very low viral titers. Our studies highlight the critical public health need to translate these findings and better
understand vaccination in this increasing population.

T
he 2009 H1N1 pandemic provided the first evidence that obe-
sity was a risk factor for developing influenza-related compli-
cations, including hospitalization and even increased mortality
(1). This increased severity is not limited to the 2009 pandemic
virus [A(pdmH1N1)]. Obesity is also linked to more severe dis-
ease with the avian A(H7N9) viruses, which first caused human
infections in March 2013 (1–3). Given that we are currently facing
our fourth wave of A(H7N9) human infections and that nearly
10% of the world’s adult population, as well as 42 million children
under the age of 5 (4), are obese (body mass index [BMI] of
�30 kg/m2), it is imperative that we understand the effectiveness
of current influenza control and prevention strategies in this pop-
ulation.
Arguably, vaccination is the best prevention against influenza
virus (5), and it is a key component for the preparedness and
response to emerging influenza virus strains, including A(H7N9)
viruses (6). Unfortunately, vaccines against avian influenza vi-
ruses have been poorly immunogenic in mammals, including hu-
mans, in spite of increased antigenic dose (7–9). Adjuvants are an
effective means to increase humoral responses to influenza vac-
cines (10–15). Recent studies in ferrets (14) and humans (13, 15)
demonstrated that administering vaccines with squalene oil-in-
water adjuvants (MF59 and AS03) resulted in increased serologi-
cal responses against a monovalent A(H7N9) influenza vaccine.
However, no studies to date have examined the effectiveness of
vaccines against emerging influenza viruses in the obese host, nor
have they explored the effectiveness of adjuvants in this high-risk
population. This is crucial, given that obesity has been associated

 with decreased response to seasonal influenza vaccines in animal
models and human studies (16–18).
In these studies, we tested the efficacy of alum-adjuvanted, AS03-
adjuvanted, or nonadjuvanted A(pdmH1N1) and A(H7N9) vac-
cines in lean and obese mice. Given the poor immunogenicity of
seasonal vaccines in obese populations, we hypothesized that ad-
juvanted vaccine would improve humoral responses and protect
obese mice from influenza virus challenge. While both types of
adjuvanted vaccine did result in seroconversion and the genera-
tion of neutralizing and nonneutralizing antibodies, obese mice
were not protected from challenge and had delayed viral clearance
compared to lean mice. Increasing the antigenic dose had no im-
pact on protection. Using several distinct methodologies, we
found that the overall breadth and magnitude of the humoral
response to both the viral hemagglutinin (HA) and neuramini-
dase (NA) were significantly decreased in the obese mice even with
the addition of AS03. This result, combined with the increased
disease severity in the face of low levels of virus, likely results in
reduced protection from viral challenge, even when neutralizing
antibodies levels reach reportedly protective titers (i.e., �1:40)
(19). Given that in the United States alone, severe obesity has been
forecasted to increase by 130% in the next two decades (20) and
�70% of the European population is predicted to be overweight
by 2030 (21), understanding why overweight/obesity results in
impaired vaccine responses and increased susceptibility to severe
infection are paramount for public health.
RESULTS
Adjuvanted vaccines increase seroconversion in obese mice.
Previous studies have shown that obese mice mount poor serolog-
ical responses to seasonal influenza vaccination (17, 18). To de-
termine whether adjuvants improved these responses, C57BL/6
(wild type [WT] lean) and B6.Cg-Lepob/J (obese) mice were vac-
cinated with the A(H7N9) vaccine manufactured by Sanofi-
Pasteur or with seasonal vaccine against A/California/04/2009
(pdmH1N1) in the presence or absence of alum or AS03 adjuvant
following the scheme in Fig. S1. Both alum and AS03 adjuvant
increased neutralizing antibody titers as measured by hemagglu-
tination inhibition (HAI) and microneutralization (MN) in both
lean and obese mice compared to the titers with vaccine alone,
although the titers were significantly lower when using alum than
with AS03. In addition, the titers in the obese animals were signif-
icantly decreased compared to those in lean controls (Fig. 1 and
2A and B, respectively). With the A(H7N9) vaccine, the HAI titers
ranged from 1:20 to 1:240 in obese mice receiving adjuvanted
vaccine, while in lean mice, the HAI titers ranged from 1:80 to
1:620 (Fig. 1A). A similar trend was observed by measuring MN,
where 100% of the lean mice receiving adjuvanted vaccine had
MN titers ranging from 1:1,600 to 1:9,600, while the MN titers in
obese mice were significantly decreased, ranging from 1:800 to
1:3,200 (Fig. 1B). In contrast to the obese mice, 80% of the lean
mice receiving unadjuvanted vaccine also had increased MN ti-
ters, ranging from 1:100 to 1:200 (Fig. 1B). Similarly, the addition
of adjuvant to seasonal A(pdmH1N1) vaccine also increased the
HAI and MN titers in both lean and obese animals, with slightly
decreased responses overall in obese mice compared to those in
lean controls (Fig. 2A and B).
In addition to stimulating neutralizing antibodies toward the
HA globular head domain, the generation of antibodies toward
other domains of the virus, including the highly conserved stalk
region or the NA protein, can also contribute to protective re-
sponses following vaccination (22, 23). To date, no studies have
determined the impact of obesity on the generation of broadly
neutralizing stalk antibodies or neuraminidase-inhibiting (NI)
antibodies. Therefore, we measured H7 and H1 stalk and NI an-
tibody levels in vaccinated mice by enzyme-linked immunosor-
bent assay (ELISA) and enzyme-linked lectin assay (ELLA), re-
spectively. Virus-specific stalk antibody levels increased in both
lean and obese mice even with vaccine alone (Fig. S2), and adju-
vanted vaccination increased the stalk responses compared to
those with vaccine alone; however, obese mice had significantly
decreased responses with both adjuvants compared to their lean
counterparts (Fig. 1C and 2C). Similarly, the addition of both
adjuvants to the vaccine greatly increased NI antibodies in both
the lean (NI range, 1:40 to 1:240) and obese (NI range, 1:20 to
1:160) mice, although the levels in obese mice were again signifi-
cantly lower (Fig. 1D). Again, a very similar trend was observed
with responses to the seasonal pdmH1N1 vaccine (Fig. 2D). Over-
all, these data indicate that, despite being slightly decreased com-
pared to lean controls, serological responses to both mammalian
and avian influenza vaccines are increased by adjuvanted vaccines
in the obese host.
Obesity affects the breadth and magnitude of the antibody
response. Neutralizing and nonneutralizing antibody titers were
reduced in the obese mice. However, the ELISA does not tell us
whether obesity modulates the antibody repertoire by modifying
the frequency of antibodies specific for particular HA or NA
epitopes or whether there is a generalized decrease in response to
all epitopes. To examine this and have a snapshot of the impact of
obesity on the overall IgG response to vaccination, we evaluated
the prevalence of antibodies specific for the A(H7N9) HA (Fig. 3A
and B) or NA (Fig. 3C and D) proteins as described previously
(24). Briefly, we generated antigen microarrays (AM), using 20-
amino-acid peptides with an overlap of 15 amino acids, to provide
dense coverage of potential A(H7N9) HA and NA epitopes. The
sera from the different groups were incubated on the microarrays,
and the amount of IgG bound to each epitope quantified by mea-
suring the fluorescence intensity of antibodies bound to mouse
IgG. To quantify these effects, we summarized the AM data using
two commonly used summary statistics: overall response breadth
(the number of epitopes targeted) and magnitude (amount of
antibody). We then compared the magnitude and breadth of each
of the six experimental groups in the study. In concurrence with
the inhibition assays and ELISA/ELLA data, we found that vacci-
nated lean mice generated stronger and more broad antibody re-
sponses to the H7 HA (Fig. 3A and B) and N9 (Fig. 3C and D)
peptide antigens than did obese mice. These differences in mag-
nitude and breadth directly correlated with MN and HAI titers on
an individual mouse basis (Fig. 4). Overall, these studies show that
an adjuvanted vaccine increases the levels of both neutralizing and
nonneutralizing antibodies in obese mice, although the breadth
and the magnitude of the response are significantly lower than in
lean mice.
Despite seroconversion, obese mice are not protected during
influenza virus challenge. Although the titers were lower than in
lean mice, obese mice receiving both adjuvanted vaccines did gen-
erate neutralizing and nonneutralizing antibody titers that we hy-
pothesized would be protective against influenza virus challenge.
To test this, vaccinated lean and obese mice were challenged with
105.5 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID50) A/Anhui/1/

 2013 A(H7N9) or 104.5 TCID50 pdmH1N1 influenza virus 3 weeks
postboost and monitored for morbidity. All lean mice receiving
adjuvanted vaccines were protected from influenza virus chal-
lenge and had only minimal (5 to 10%) weight loss (Fig. 5A and
6A). In addition, 80% of lean mice receiving unadjuvanted
A(H7N9) vaccine were also protected from challenge, although
their weight loss was significantly higher (~20%). This could be
due to the increased neutralizing (Fig. 1B) and nonneutralizing
stalk antibodies (see Fig. S2 in the supplemental material) in vac-
cinated lean mice. In comparison, all lean mice receiving seasonal
A(pdmH1N1) vaccine, regardless of adjuvants, were fully pro-
tected from challenge, with good generation of both neutralizing
(Fig. 2A and B) and nonneutralizing (see Fig. S2) antibodies.
In contrast, vaccinated obese mice were not protected from
challenge irrespective of adjuvant use. For A(H7N9) challenge, all
obese mice lost weight and rapidly succumbed to infection in spite
of a slight increase in weight at 5 days postinfection (dpi) in the
adjuvanted-vaccine group (Fig. 5B). As with previous studies, the
failure to protect obese mice is not unique to the A(H7N9) vac-
cine. As shown by the results in Fig. 6B, we and others (17, 18)
demonstrated that seasonal influenza vaccines also fail to protect
obese mice.
The reduced protection in vaccinated obese mice was associ-
ated with increased viral loads compared to the viral loads in vac-
cinated lean mice. For both vaccines, at 3 dpi, lean mice receiving
the unadjuvanted vaccine had significantly reduced viral loads in
the lungs compared to those of unvaccinated controls, with the
levels reduced to the limit of detection by 5 dpi (Fig. 5C and 6C).
Lean mice receiving adjuvanted vaccine had nearly undetectable
viral loads in lung samples at 3 and 5 dpi. In contrast, titers were
increased in the obese mice and remained above the limit of de-
tection until the time of death even in mice receiving adjuvanted
vaccine (Fig. 5C and 6C), although the adjuvanted vaccine did
reduce the viral loads compared to those in the unadjuvanted or
unvaccinated mice (Fig. 5C and 6C).
Increasing the vaccine dose has no impact on survival in
obese mice. A recent phase 4 clinical trial in the elderly showed
that increasing the dose of vaccine antigen significantly increased
vaccine effectiveness in this high-risk population (25). Given that
obesity induces an immunocompromised state similar to age (16)

 and that the standard vaccination regimen did not confer protec-
tion, we tested whether an increased antigenic dose would protect
obese mice from A(H7N9) challenge. Thus, mice were vaccinated
with a 4� increased dose of unadjuvanted or adjuvanted vaccine
and challenged with influenza virus A/Anhui/1/2013. As expected,
all of the vaccinated lean mice were protected from challenge. In
contrast, while the increased vaccine dose in conjunction with
adjuvant did significantly increase the antibody response com-
pared to the response to the basal dose in the obese mice (Fig. 7A),
none of the high-dose-vaccinated obese mice were protected, in-
dicating that an increased vaccine dosage may not increase overall
vaccine efficacy in an obese population (Fig. 7B), although it did
significantly increase the average number of days of survival com-
pared to the survival of mice receiving the standard vaccine regi-
men for both the unadjuvanted and adjuvanted groups, with av-
erage increases of 1.2 days and 3.6 days, respectively (Fig. 7C).
Overall, these studies demonstrate that adjuvanted vaccine failed
to protect obese mice from influenza challenge, even when the
vaccine antigen dose is increased, and the viral titers remained
elevated in spite of the generation of robust antibody responses.
Passive immunization fails to protect obese mice. Although
the adjuvanted vaccine did induce antibodies in obese mice, they
were not protected from infection. To determine whether this was
a problem with the antibodies themselves or the microenviron-
ment, we passively immunized obese mice with postvaccination
lean sera. Briefly, naive obese mice were intraperitoneally ad-
ministered sera containing equivalent IgG amounts from lean
and obese mice that were either unvaccinated or had received
the AS03-adjuvanted A(H7N9) vaccine and were then chal-
lenged with 100� 50% mean lethal dose (MLD50) of influenza
virus A/Anhui/1/2013 at 24 h posttransfer. The antibody levels
pre- and posttransfer were confirmed by both IgG ELISA and
HAI (see Fig. S3 in the supplemental material). In contrast to
lean mice receiving lean sera, obese mice were not protected
from infection regardless of the serum source (Fig. 8). These
data demonstrate that the administration of known protective
antibodies failed to protect obese mice from influenza virus
challenge, which may indicate that the problem lies with the
obese host response rather than the protective capacity of an-
tibody responses.
Obese mice have partial protection at lower viral doses. Obe-
sity is associated with increased risk of developing severe and even
fatal influenza virus infection (1–3, 26). Indeed, we have previ-
ously shown that significantly less pandemic H1N1 virus is re-

 quired to induce disease in obese mice than in lean mice (27, 28).
Thus, we questioned whether the extreme susceptibility of obese
mice to severe influenza virus infection overrode the protection
conferred by vaccination. First we determined the MLD50s of the
A(H7N9) virus in lean and obese mice. The MLD50 in obese mice
is 102, compared to 103.5 in lean animals, a 30� decrease (Fig. 9A),
suggesting that our 100� LD50 challenge dose, which was deter-
mined using lean animals, was actually a 3,000� dose in the obese
mice. Therefore, mice were administered vaccine plus adjuvant
and challenged with 1� and 10� MLD50 based on lean mice (31.6
and 316 MLD50 for obese mice) 3 weeks postboost (Fig. 9B). As
expected, lean mice were completely protected. In contrast, vacci-
nation failed to protect 100% of the obese mice even at the lowest
dose, indicating that the hypersusceptibility of the obese host to
severe disease could be contributing to the decreased vaccine effi-
cacy. Whether this finding holds true in humans requires further
study.
DISCUSSION
In this study, we demonstrate that the addition of both alum and
the squalene oil-in-water adjuvant, ASO3, to an influenza vaccine
increased seroconversion in obese mice with two different influ-
enza vaccines. Although lower than the responses in lean mice,
obese mice mounted significant neutralizing and nonneutralizing
antibody responses toward both vaccines with the addition of ei-
ther adjuvant. And yet, despite the increased seroconversion,
obese mice were not protected from either influenza virus chal-
lenge and had significantly increased morbidity and mortality
compared to those in the lean controls. These findings highlights
that more work may be needed, especially in high-risk popula-
tions, to determine the immune correlates of protection, particu-
larly the long-held paradigm that an HAI titer of �40 or a fourfold
increase in titer from baseline levels is sufficient for protection
against infection (19). Our study suggests that the currently used
influenza immune correlate is not suited for the obese population.
Coupled with the increasing incidence of obesity in the United
States, this highlights the need for identifying novel correlates of
protection for influenza vaccination.
In spite of generating neutralizing and nonneutralizing anti-
bodies, obese mice were not protected from influenza virus chal-
lenge and had delayed viral clearance compared to that in lean
controls. Therefore, the increased morbidity and mortality seen in
these mice is likely due to the inability to mitigate viral infection.
Increasing the vaccine dose had no impact on morbidity. In addi-
tion to the observed differences in the ability to mount a protective
antibody response following vaccination, obese mice have addi-
tional deficiencies that make them more susceptible to severe in-
FIG 3 Obesity impacts the magnitude and breadth of antibody response to influenza vaccination. Antigen microarrays were used to examine the differences in

 fluenza virus infections. Previous studies in our laboratory and
others (27, 29) have shown that obesity increases the severity of
disease from both mouse-adapted and human influenza virus
strains. While the exact mechanisms for this increased severity
of influenza virus infection in the obese host are unknown,
obesity-associated decreases in key immunologic and wound
repair functions critical for appropriate response to respiratory
infection are implicated (27, 30). Indeed, while obese mice did
have a significantly lower MLD50 than lean controls, lowering
the viral challenge dose below 100� MLD50 in the obese ani-
mals did not result in complete protection, suggesting that
both vaccine response and susceptibility to infection can play a
factor in the obese host.
The results from this study raise major concerns over vaccina-
tion effectiveness in the obese host. Studies of influenza vaccine
responses in obese adults and children have had various results,
with some studies showing no differences between lean and obese
groups based on serological responses (16, 31–34); however, our
studies may indicate that even if the obese population appears
serologically protected, effectiveness may be decreased and in-
creased incidence of influenza may occur in an increasingly obese
population. Future studies will focus on these questions and try to
elucidate why obesity increases the susceptibility to and severity of
influenza virus infection, as well as the underlying immunological
mechanisms that lead to lack of protection even following adju-
vanted vaccination.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Ethics statement. All procedures were approved by the St. Jude Children’s
Research Hospital Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC) and Animal
Care and Use Committee (IACUC) and were in compliance with the
Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. These guidelines were
established by the Institute of Laboratory Animal Resources and approved
by the Governing Board of the U.S. National Research Council.
Laboratory facilities. All infection experiments were conducted in a
biosafety level 3 enhanced containment laboratory (35). Investigators
were required to wear appropriate respirator equipment (Racal Health
and Safety, Inc., Frederick, MD). Mice were housed in HEPA-filtered,
negative-pressure, vented isolation containers.
Vaccines and adjuvants. The H7N9 vaccine and AS03 adjuvant were
provided by the Office of Biomedical Development Advanced Research
and Development Authority. The H7N9 vaccine is a split-virion vaccine
derived from A/Shanghai/2/2013 (H7N9), manufactured by Sanofi-
Pasteur. AS03 (GlaxoSmithKline) is a squalene-based oil-in-water emul-
sion containing the immunostimulant �-tocopherol (vitamin E) (36). For
vaccination against pdmH1N1, mice were vaccinated with an influenza
virus A (pdmH1N1) 2009 monovalent vaccine containing BPL-

Viruses. For the pdmH1N1 studies, mice were challenged with A/Cal-

hui/1/2013 H7N9 virus, which is antigenically similar to the vaccine strain
and causes relatively severe disease in mice (14, 28). All viral stocks were
propagated in the allantoic cavity of 10-day-old specific-pathogen-free
embryonated chicken eggs at 37°C. Allantoic fluid was harvested, cleared
by centrifugation, and stored at �80°C as described previously (37, 38).
Viral titers were determined by 50% tissue culture infectious dose
(TCID50) analysis as previously described (37).
Cells and culture medium. MDCK cells were cultured in Eagle’s
minimum essential medium (MEM; Mediatech, Manassas, VA) sup-
plemented with 2 mM glutamine and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS;
Gemini Bioproducts, West Sacramento, CA) and grown at 37°C under

or 11/group) with PBS or 0.375 �g (standard dose) or 1.4 �g (high dose)
H7N9 vaccine with or without adjuvant. Three weeks after the initial
vaccination, mice were bled and then boosted. Three weeks postboost,
animals were lightly anesthetized with isoflurane, bled, and then inocu-
lated intranasally with PBS or 100�, 10�, or 1� (105.5, 104.5, and 103.5
TCID50, respectively) MLD50 (based on lean animals) of virus in 30 �l
PBS. Mice were monitored daily for clinical signs of infection and weighed
every 24 h postinfection (39). At days 3 and 5 after 100� MLD50 infection,
mice (n � 3/group) were euthanized, and tissues were harvested and
processed immediately or stored at �80°C for future analysis. Moribund
mice losing more than 30% body weight and reaching a specified body
condition index score were humanely euthanized. For passive transfer
experiments,
serum
was
prepared
from
vaccine-plus-adjuvant-
vaccinated mice to equivalent IgG levels, and then 100 �l was injected into
lean or obese mice intraperitoneally. Twenty-four hours posttransfer,
mice were bled and infected with 100� MLD50 of virus as described
above.

 Influenza virus-specific antibody determination. Mouse sera were
treated with receptor-destroying enzyme (RDE; Seiken), and hemagglu-
tination inhibition (HAI) assays were performed according to WHO
guidelines (40). Luminescent microneutralization (MN) assays were per-
formed as previously described, using a reverse genetics-generated
A/Anhui/1/2013 virus or A/California/04/2009 virus containing an NLuc
(NanoLuc luciferase) on its polymerase segment (41). Neuraminidase in-
hibition assays were conducted by enzyme-linked lectin assay for N1- and
N9-specific antibodies as previously described (14), using a recombinant
reverse genetics (rg)-H6N9 virus with the NA from A/Anhui/1/H7N9
(H7N9) and a mismatched HA from A/Teal/Hong Kong/W312/1997
(H6N1) or an A/California/04/2009 virus.
Influenza-specific ELISA. H7N9-specific IgG ELISAs were performed
as described previously (42), utilizing horseradish peroxidase-conjugated
goat anti-mouse antibodies (Southern Biotech, Birmingham, AL).
Stalk antibody ELISA. Recombinant stalk proteins against H1 and H7
were produced (43, 44), and ELISAs were performed as previously de-
scribed (45).
Antigen microarrays. Peptides 20 amino acids in length spanning the
HA and NA proteins of the A/Anhui/1/2013 (H7N9) virus were generated
with 15-amino-acid overlaps, resulting in the synthesis of 110 HA pep-
tides and 90 NA peptides synthesized at �90% purity (CPC Scientific). A
small number of peptides were synthesized at �70% purity, following
multiple synthesis and purification attempts. A poly(K) linker was added
to each peptide to increase solubility and to improve the binding orienta-
tion of peptides to the Hydrogel slides. The peptides were lyophilized in

serological analyses. (b) Mice were then challenged with influenza virus A/Anhui/1/2013 and monitored for survival daily for 14 days postinfection. Statistical
significance was determined by log rank (Mantel-Cox) test, with a P value of �0.05 deemed significant compared to the PBS control group. *, P � 0.05. (c) Days
of survival are presented as the number of days mice survived after influenza virus challenge � standard error. Statistical significance was determined using
ANOVA, with vaccine strategy and mouse type as the main effects. A P value of �0.05 compared to the PBS control group was deemed significant. *, P � 0.05;
**, P � 0.005; ***, P � 0.0005; ****, P � 0.00005. Asterisks alone indicate significance compared to the PBS control group, and dashed lines indicate significance

FIG 8 Survival in obese mice following passive serum transfer and H7N9
virus challenge. Sera containing equivalent antibody titers from either naive
(solid symbols) or vaccine-plus-adjuvant-vaccinated (open symbols) lean
(circles) or obese (squares) mice were passively transferred to 8-week-old
obese mice (n � 3/group) intraperitoneally, and then the passively immunized
mice were challenged with influenza virus A/Anhui/1/2013. Mice were moni-
tored for survival daily for 14 days postinfection. Survival data are presented as
the percentages of animals surviving among the total number monitored. Sta-
tistical significance was determined by the log rank (Mantel-Cox) test, with a P
value of �0.05 deemed significant compared to the unvaccinated serum con-
trol group. The data shown are representative of two separate experiments.

 5-ml tubes and were stored at 20°C. The peptides were resuspended in
100 �l dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and 400 �l ultrapure water to create a
working solution of approximately 2 mg/ml. Peptide stocks were diluted
1:2 in protein-printing buffer (phosphate-buffered saline [PBS] with
0.005% Triton X-100) and printed in triplicate on N-hydroxysuccinimide
ester-derivatized glass slides (H slides; Schott/Nexterion AG) using a
QArray2 microarray instrument (Genetix) with contact microarray pins
(SMP2.5B; TeleChem). During printing, the relative humidity was main-
tained at 50 to 60%. Following printing, the slides were left to dry over-
night. The arrays were stored at 20°C. The printed grids were outlined
with a PAP hydrophobic pen (Research Products International). The
slides were chemically blocked using 4 ml of 50 mM borate, 50 mM eth-
anolamine for 1 h. The slides were then washed twice with PBS containing
0.05% Tween 20, twice with PBS, and once in deionized water and then
spun to dry at 1,000 � g for 5 min at room temperature. Serum samples
were diluted 1:25 in 1% bovine serum albumin and 0.025% Tween 20,
incubated on slides for 2 h in a humidified chamber at 25°C, and then
washed twice with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 and twice with PBS.
Bound immunoglobulins were detected for 45 min with Alexa Fluor 647
goat anti-mouse IgG (115-605-008; Jackson ImmunoResearch). The ar-
rays were washed as noted above and were spun dry as described above.
The slides were scanned on a two-laser GenePix 4400SL scanner (Molec-
ular Devices) probing for IgG responses. Images were analyzed using
GenePix version 7.2 to obtain the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) for
each probe. All samples were run the same day and processed together.
Negative controls were run in triplicate for subtraction of background.
Responses below 1,000 MFI after subtraction of background were consid-
ered negative (MFI range, 0 to 65,000). Subsequently, all data were ana-
lyzed with MatLab (MathWorks) and Python. For each probe, we used the
median response and subtracted the average background of multiple neg-
ative controls.
Data representation. We denote the normalized array measurements
by xi,p,ap, where i is subject, i � 1, . . ., N; p is pathogen, p � 1, . . ., P; ap is
antigen a from pathogen p, ap � 1, . . ., Np. zi denotes the treatment
assignment (vaccine/placebo) of subject i and yi denotes the outcome of
subject i (vaccine-induced antibody titer/infection status/disease status);
the observed data for each subject are �zi,yi,xi,p,ap� for i � 1, . . ., N, p � 1,
. . ., P, and ap � 1, . . ., Np.
The antibody profile generated by the AMs is a multidimensional
measurement of the antibody responses to a large set of overlapping
peptides from HA and NA. To compare the peptide responses to the
HAI and MN assays as measured by the AM for a given subject, we
define the breadth b and magnitude m of responses to each protein as
follows:
mi,p ��ap�1
NP
xi,p,ap
denotes the magnitude of responses to all antigens of pathogen p and
bi,p ��ap�1
NP
I�xi,p,ap � 0�
denotes the breadth of response to antigens from pathogen p, where I
denotes the indicator function, and where positivity (xi,p,ap�0) is deter-
mined using the responses of negative controls.
Statistical analysis. For the survival data, statistical significance was
determined by log rank (Mantel-Cox) test, with a P value of �0.05
deemed significant compared to the data for the PBS control group. For
comparisons between groups for the serological and viral studies, statis-
tical significance was determined using analysis of variance (ANOVA),
with vaccine strategy, mouse type, and day postinfection as the main ef-
fects. Tukey’s test was used for post hoc comparison between days postin-
fection, mouse types, and vaccine strategies. Differences were considered
significant at a P value of �0.05. For antibody arrays, the responses of
groups were compared using the Wilcoxon rank sum test. The responses
of each group were summarized by median values. All P values for asso-
ciations between the AM data and HAI and MN assays were computed
using Spearman’s rank-order correlation. Adjustments for multiplicity
were computed using the Bonferroni correction and were adjusted sepa-
rately for comparing different vaccine treatments (PBS, vaccine, and vac-
cine plus adjuvant) within each mouse group and for comparing the same
vaccine across the two mouse groups.’s

not fully protected from decreased viral dose. (a) Obese mice were challenged
with decreasing amounts of influenza virus A/Anhui/1/2013 (H7N9) to calcu-
late the MLD50. (b) Three weeks after being boosted with a standard vaccine,
lean (solid symbols) and obese (open symbols) mice (n � 5/type/group) were
challenged with influenza virus A/Anhui/1/2013 (H7N9) at 10� MLD50 for
lean mice/316� MLD50 for obese mice or 1� MLD50/31.6� MLD50 for obese
mice. Survival was monitored for 14 days postinfection.
