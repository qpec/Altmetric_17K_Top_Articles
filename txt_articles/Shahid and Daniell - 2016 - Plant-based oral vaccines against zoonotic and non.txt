Summary
The shared diseases between animals and humans are known as zoonotic diseases and spread
infectious diseases among humans. Zoonotic diseases are not only a major burden to livestock
industry but also threaten humans accounting for >60% cases of human illness. About 75% of
emerging infectious diseases in humans have been reported to originate from zoonotic
pathogens. Because antibiotics are frequently used to protect livestock from bacterial diseases,
the development of antibiotic-resistant strains of epidemic and zoonotic pathogens is now a
major concern. Live attenuated and killed vaccines are the only option to control these infectious
diseases and this approach has been used since 1890. However, major problems with this
approach include high cost and injectable vaccines is impractical for >20 billion poultry animals or
fish in aquaculture. Plants offer an attractive and affordable platform for vaccines against animal
diseases because of their low cost, and they are free of attenuated pathogens and cold chain
requirement. Therefore, several plant-based vaccines against human and animals diseases have
been developed recently that undergo clinical and regulatory approval. Plant-based vaccines
serve as ideal booster vaccines that could eliminate multiple boosters of attenuated bacteria or
viruses, but requirement of injectable priming with adjuvant is a current limitation. So, new
approaches like oral vaccines are needed to overcome this challenge. In this review, we discuss
the progress made in plant-based vaccines against zoonotic or other animal diseases and future
challenges in advancing this field.
Introduction
Zoonosis can be defined as transmission of disease between
human and animals that happens due to interaction between
these two populations. Zoonosis not only interrupts human health
but it also affects wild life and livestock industry. Recently, more
than 65% of emerging infectious diseases in humans have been
reported to originate from zoonotic pathogens (Narrod et al.,
2012). Zoonotic diseases can be divided into two categories
depending on their mode of transmission. Vector-borne zoonotic
infection is transmitted to humans via arthropods carrier and
nonvector-borne diseases are transferred by contaminated food
or direct contact (Buza et al., 2015). Zoonotic infections in
humans started 14 000 years ago when dogs were domesticated
for hunting. Other animals like goat, sheep, cattle and pigs were
domesticated later for meat or dairy products. This domestication
increased not only the interaction between these two populations
but also the risk of their cross-contaminating diseases (Thrusfield,
2013).
The plague outbreak that killed a large proportion of the
European population was spread through rats and is an example
of the profound impact of zoonotic diseases. After smallpox,
plague is historically the second most deadly disease in human
populations and has caused millions of deaths; the Black Death
pandemic in Europe during the 14th–17th centuries caused 200
million deaths and killed one-third of European population
(Alvarez and Cardineau, 2010; Perry and Fetherston, 1997).
According to an estimate, 31 food-borne pathogens of animal
origin in United States cause 9.4 million cases of illness each year.
Salmonella spp., norovirus, Campylobacter spp, Toxoplasma
gonidii, avian influenza virus, swine flu virus, Listeria monocyto-
genes and norovirus are major pathogens, producing zoonotic
infections in humans. Salmonella is a major human health
concern in the United States, causing one million cases of illness
and 400 deaths annually. Salmonella is the most common
pathogen in turkey and poultry and causes multiple human
salmonellosis in the United States through contaminated food
(Routh et al., 2015). Norovirus is another important zoonotic
pathogen in the United States. It is responsible for 50% of food-
borne gastroenteritis outbreaks in the United States, leading to
19–21 million cases of illness and 570–800 deaths annually. It is a
major cause of viral gastrointestinal outbreaks in cruise ships in
the USA and spreads by direct contact. Contaminated food is an
another important source for the spread of norovirus infection in
the United States (Stock et al., 2015). Similarly in Australia 30%
illness is caused by food-borne pathogens and in England and
Wales 8% illness is due to contaminated food of animal origin by
Norovirus. Moreover, people working in production and farm
areas are at high risk of acquiring infection from various animals.
Farm workers act as channel to spread zoonotic pathogens to the
public (Gray and Kayali, 2009). Although zoonotic diseases kill a
much larger population in developing countries, accurate docu-
mentation or statistics is not available.
Growing populations and increased demand for food have led
to increased production of food of animal origin. In most
developing countries, almost 66% of the population is protein
deficient; the total protein requirement per person is 103 g per
day, but protein-deficient individuals consume only 69% of this

 amount, most of it in the form of red and white meat. Livestock
production has played a major role in meeting this demand.
Among livestock, ruminants and poultry are the cheapest and
most efficient source of high-quality protein; they can easily
compensate for protein deficiencies among the population
(Ashraf and Shah, 2014). Livestock production is playing very
important role in accomplishing food security, influenced strongly
by cultural preferences (Godber and Wall, 2014). According to
the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), current
global beef and veal production is almost 59.2 million tons and is
expected to increase by 1% in 2016. Pork production is now at
112.0 million tons and is expected to remain stable in 2016, and
89.3 million tons of broiler meat is produced and is expected to
rise 2% in 2016. The United States and India are largest
producers of beef, whereas Australia is the largest beef supplier.
Similarly, the United States, Brazil and China are largest producers
of
broiler
meat
(http://www.usda.gov/wps/portal/usda/usda-
home). Animals support life on earth by providing high-quality
protein through dairy products and meat, but this industry is
severely hampered by parasitic and infectious diseases of both
endemic and epidemic in nature, negatively impacting global
economy (Rich and Perry, 2011). For example, the epidemic
outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in the United Kingdom in
2001 resulted in direct economic loss of $11.9–$18.4 billion
including loss of agriculture and food industry (Carpenter et al.,
2011). Animal health is an important element in providing safe
products to humans. Animal disease management is a major
concern for livestock, poultry and fish industries to provide
pathogen-free products to the consumer (Kolotilin et al., 2014).
The complex global system and human interaction with pet
animal, livestock and poultry has made it essential to consider
human and animal health as a common and not two isolated
problems. However, development of medicines to control animal
diseases is a big challenge in field of veterinary medicine. The
major challenges are the cost and volume. Most human vaccines
are given as injections and it is impossible to inject large numbers
of animals. Lives of farmed animals are very different from their
natural lives, as most animals in the United States are reared in
factory farms. This favours increased production and maximizes
profit margins but also increases the risk of the spread of
infectious diseases. Live attenuated and killed vaccines are the
only available option to control these infectious diseases. How-
ever, the main problem with them is their high cost versus profit,
and the use of injectable vaccines is impractical, if not impossible,
to control disease in large farms.
Plants offer an attractive and affordable platform for vaccines
against animal diseases, especially in industries with low profit
margins. So, edible orally delivered, low-cost vaccines are an
urgent need in the production of disease-free animals. Topp et al.
(2016) recently provided a general overview of efficacy, compet-
itiveness and regulatory approval of plant-made veterinary
immunotherapeutics. This manuscript is a highly comprehensive
in-depth review of plant-made veterinary vaccines to control
zoonotic diseases, which has not been addressed in any previous
review. In addition, mechanisms of different vaccine delivery
methods and vaccines to control nonzoonotic diseases are also
reviewed.
Current strategies to control zoonotic and animal
diseases
The first discovery of small pox vaccine by Edward Jenner opened
a new world for the prevention of infectious diseases. Since that
time, many approaches have been adopted to control humans
and animal diseases using essentially the same concept (Joensuu
et al., 2008). Behring and Kitasato first introduced the concept of
serum therapy when they induced immunity in animals by serum
treated with nonlethal toxin dose (Behring et al., 1890). Later on,
advancement in proteomics resulted in the use of mouse
hybridoma cells from immunized mice to produce specific
monoclonal therapeutic antibodies (K€
ohler and Milstein, 1975)
that conferred protection against human diseases. But use of
antibody therapy is severely limited by their high production cost.
The estimated high production cost for protein drug ($140 billion
in 2013) has made them unaffordable in most developing
countries, as most people earn less than $2 per day (Kwon and
Daniell, 2015). Infectious diseases of animals are a large concern
throughout the world, especially in developing countries. It is
estimated that 58% human pathogens are zoonotic, that is
transmitted from animals, major cause for emerging infectious
diseases. Vaccination is the only possible tool to control these
infectious diseases especially in animals with short life span (Loza-
Rubio and Rojas-Anaya, 2010).
Since 1940, a number of vaccines have been developed using
inactivated, attenuated and live viruses. The most common and
licensed vaccines against infectious diseases of animals are live
attenuated or killed live attenuated pathogens or recombinant
proteins. Porcilis-PCV2 and Suvaxyn PCV2 for pigs, Periovac for
dogs, AquaVac ERM, AquaVac Furuvac, AquaVac Vibrio for fish are
commercialized and licensed vaccines against veterinary diseases
(Meeusen et al., 2007). In inactivated virus-based vaccines, the
disease-causing virus has been killed by heat, radiation or other
methods. The drawback of this type of vaccine is that it causes a
weaker immune response than live vaccines and several booster
doses are needed to acquire an adequate level of immunity. Live
vaccines contain live virus that is weak but still infectious. Live virus-
based vaccines are usually prepared in lyophilized form and can be
stored for up to 1 year at 4 °C. PreveNile against horses, Vaxxitek
HVT+IBD against poultry, Bovilis IBR Marker against cattle,
RECOMBITEK Canine Parvo against dogs, RECOMBITEK Corona
MLV against dogs, Enterisol Ileitis against pigs are commercially
available live virus vaccines (Meeusen et al., 2007). Live virus
vaccines have some disadvantages, as there is always a risk of their
regaining virulence. Although these are not well documented in
veterinary vaccines because of their short life, they are well
documented in human vaccines. Sabin strains used in oral polio
vaccine (OPV) revert to virulence by recombination with other
enteroviruses or by point mutations (Burns et al., 2014; Runckel
et al., 2013). Several decades ago, genetic instability and vaccine-
associated paralytic poliomyelitis (VAPP) was reported among
recipients of OPV in the United States and their close contacts
(Alexander et al., 2004; Schonberger et al., 1976). Outbreaks in
the Dominican Republic and Haiti a decade ago (Kew et al., 2002)
led to the discovery of circulating vaccine-derived polioviruses
(VDPV) (Diop et al., 2015; Lakhani and Bumb, 2014). Therefore,
the World Health Organization has recommended complete
withdrawal of OPV Type 2 by April 2016 globally (Chan et al.,
2016). Such an outbreak of attenuated live vaccines against
zoonotic diseases is a major concern. In addition, the mode of
delivery of live vaccines via sprays or aerosols pose additional
challenges. The aerosol mode of administration can unintentionally
inoculate younger or more susceptible animals, which can ulti-
mately cause death (Alexander, 2012).
Advances in biotechnology have resulted in the development
of recombinant therapeutics. E. coli was used as first expression

 system for the production of recombinant therapeutics. After a
number of efforts in the field of recombinant therapeutics and
approval of Escherichia coli-expressed recombinant human insulin
established the importance of recombinant therapeutics. Recom-
binant therapeutics production involves the expression and
purification of immunogenic antigens instead of the whole virus
or pathogens. These recombinant vaccines are useful to control
infectious diseases of animals due to reduced risk associated with
live and killed viral vaccines. Recombinant therapeutics are
expensive to produce but they are found to be effective in
humans. There are different systems to produce recombinant
therapeutics, including bacteria, insect cells, yeast, mammalian
cell culture and transgenic animals. Bacteria and yeast-based
production systems are more efficient because of their rapid
replication rate. However, recombinant proteins need to be
purified to remove host-derived proteins, and this is a major
contributing factor to the cost of recombinant therapeutics
(Joensuu et al., 2008). The global market of animal vaccine is
almost $5507.3 million and it is likely to increase $7197.9 million
in 2020. The animal vaccine market is based on poultry diseases,
livestock diseases, porcine diseases, aquaculture and equine
diseases. The expansion of vaccine market is boosted by many
factors, but the main factor is increasing incidence of zoonotic
infections in humans, which spreads by direct contact with
animals or food-borne pathogens (Kolotilin et al., 2014). Expres-
sion of protective antigens in plants is a new vaccination
technology that is more economical than any other available
system of vaccines production (Joensuu et al., 2008).
Plant-made vaccines against zoonotic and animal
diseases
Edible vaccine production for veterinary use has received wide-
spread attention because of health initiatives aimed at decreasing
antibiotic use in livestock and other animals to avoid the
development of antibiotic-resistant strains, especially of epidemic
and zoonotic pathogens. These issues have promoted the
development of plant-based vaccines, which can easily fulfil
these requirements (Sack et al., 2015). Various vaccines against
infectious animal diseases are available in the market and show
good results, but they have several disadvantages (Meeusen
et al., 2007). The major drawbacks of these vaccines are their
complex and expensive production and purification, their require-
ment for low-temperature storage, safety issues and the need for
a skilled person for administration. Subunit vaccines are expensive
and difficult to produce and always requires low-temperature
storage. Apex-IHN against Salmon and West Nile-Innovator DNA
against horses are commercially available DNA vaccines, but
major drawbacks of DNA vaccines are monotonic responses and
require extensive safety protocols (Meeusen et al., 2007). Whole-
cell vaccines also have problems associated with administration
and low-temperature storage. Another main reason to avoid
conventional vaccine for most of viral infection is that their use
can affect disease-free status of country by enhancing disease
scrutiny. For example, inactivated vaccine for FMD is quite
effective but it is still banned in disease-free countries because of
its consequence on international trade (Ruiz et al., 2015).
The field of plant genetic engineering started in 1970, when
extensive research was carried out to discover ways to utilize
plant genetics for reasons other than nutrition. After early studies
on expression of a few biopharmaceuticals, antigens against
different human and animal diseases were expressed in plants
(Liew and Hair-Bejo, 2015). The United States Department of
Agriculture (USDA) approved the world’s first plant-based vaccine
in 2006. Dow AgroSciences received approval for the first plant-
based vaccine against Newcastle disease virus (NDV) from the
USDA. Dow Agro Sciences used tobacco suspension cell lines to
develop a plant-based vaccine (injectable) against NDV. This
vaccine was approved by the USDA in 2006 after showing 90%
protection against a challenge with NDV virus. This system can be
used to produce a large quantity of antigen in a very short period
of a few weeks, but the company did not commercialize the
product. Although this is a plant-based vaccine, injectable mode
of administration did not offer significant cost advantages.
However, the success of the first commercial plant-made vaccine
against NDV by Dow Agro Sciences opened the door for the
commercialization of plant-made vaccines (Yusibov et al., 2011).
Edible vaccines are actually recombinant vaccines in which
selected antigens against a particular pathogen are introduced
into a plant. Oral delivery of this plant induces a protective
immune response against that particular pathogen in the form of
an edible vaccine (Aswathi et al., 2014). Almost 200 proteins
have been produced in plants, and their promising results make
them new competitors in the field of recombinant proteins.
Vaccine production through plants has several advantages over
other eukaryotic production systems. They are cost-effective and
safe and can be produced in large quantities. With plant-based
production systems, a glasshouse or a plot of land can easily
replace the expensive use of fermenters (Daniell et al., 2016b,
2009). The estimated cost for plant-based production is much
lower as compared to mammalian and E. coli system with basic
need of light, water and simple large-scale production method.
Vaccine antigen can be delivered easily just in the form of plant
material instead of needle-based delivery (Liew and Hair-Bejo,
2015). Plant-based medicines are usually free from the toxins and
pathogens that are commonly produced in bacteria and yeast
(Kwon et al., 2013). Plant cells expressing vaccine antigens or
biopharmaceuticals can be lyophilized and stored at ambient
temperature for many years maintaining efficacy of expressed
protein drugs (Kwon et al., 2013; Lakshmi et al., 2013; Su et al.,
2015; Kwon et al., 2013; Lakshmi et al., 2013; Su et al., 2015).
Except for their lower cost, plant-produced proteins and thera-
peutics are very similar to recombinant proteins that have been
produced in eukaryotes (Daniell et al., 2009). Plant-based vacci-
nes or therapeutic proteins can be post-translationally modified.
Moreover, glycans are different in plants and animals and this has
a strong effect on immunogenicity (Chan and Daniell, 2015;
Kwon and Daniell, 2015; Tremblay et al., 2010). They also negate
the issue of restored virulence that is associated with live vaccines
(Clarke et al., 2013). Plant-based vaccines have the potential to
induce a mucosal immune response and a systemic immune
response without the pain and risk associated with needles and
injections. Another advantage of plant-based vaccines is that they
can be given directly to animals after oral priming with adjuvants
(Chan and Daniell, 2015). The plant cell wall protects the foreign
antigen until it is digested by gut microbes, releasing the antigen
and promoting the immune response (Kwon et al., 2013). Animal
studies show that these vaccines are protected from degradation
by the digestive enzymes of the stomach through bioencapsula-
tion, and they can produce a protective immune response after
encountering a pathogen (Figure 1) (Lakshmi et al., 2013). The
best plants for edible vaccines are vegetables and fruits like
potato, tomato, carrot, maize, banana, lettuce, tobacco, and rice
and soya bean. However, it is difficult to control antigen dose in
fresh fruits and vegetables. Therefore, plant material should be

 freeze-dried to control dose (Chan and Daniell, 2015; Daniell
et al., 2016a). When animals eat transgenic seeds, fruit or plants
in the form of edible vaccines, mucosal-specific antibodies
(Okamura et al., 2014) and serum-specific antibodies (IgG) are
produced (Sack et al., 2015). In most animals and birds, the gut-
associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) is responsible for inducing an
immune response (Aswathi et al., 2014). Antigens from the
lumen or intestine are recognized by M cells in the Peyer’s
patches, and M cells activate B lymphocytes with assistance of Th
cells. B lymphocytes produce the mucosal immune response and
IgA, which kills pathogens by binding to surface proteins.
Another method of antigen uptake is mediated by dendritic
intestinal cells, which induce a systemic immune response in the
form of IgG antibodies. Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) are
activated by Th cells and induce a strong cellular immune
response. Thus, edible vaccines have the potential to induce
mucosal, systemic and cellular immune responses (Chan and
Daniell, 2015; Guan et al., 2013).
Plant expression systems to produce vaccine antigens
Nuclear transformation
Nuclear transformation is the simplest and most extensively used
system for the production of genetically modified crops. In this
system, a foreign antigen is expressed from the nuclear genome
via Agrobacterium tumefaciens or biolistic gene gun-mediated
transformation (Figure 1a) Agrobacterium tumefaciens is a soil-
borne, Gram-negative bacterium that can transform a foreign
gene into a host by making a crown gall. Agrobacterium infects
plant tissues by sensing the phenolic secretions of wounded
plants. These specific signals activate bacterial virulence (Vir)
genes that produce Vir proteins. Ti plasmids induce the formation
of T-DNA molecules. T-DNA associates with Vir proteins to make
a T-DNA complex. A complex network between bacterial Vir
proteins and T-DNA ultimately transfers the T-DNA into the
nuclear genome of the host plant. The T-DNA principle of gene
transfer has made it an important tool in plant genetic engineer-
ing to transform foreign genes into plants (Kim and Yang, 2010;
Pitzschke, 2013). Foreign genes integrate into the nuclear
genome, allowing the continuous production of recombinant
protein (Chan and Daniell, 2015; Guan et al., 2013; Tremblay
et al., 2010). Another advantage of nuclear transformation is the
post-translational modification of recombinant proteins that
occurs in this eukaryotic production system. After post-transla-
tional modification, depending on signal peptides, proteins can
be stored in various organelles or secreted (Tremblay et al.,
2010). But there are several disadvantages linked with this system
including gene silencing, position effect, low expression level and
risk of transgene contamination via pollen or seeds, limiting
commercial development of plant-based recombinant vaccines
(Fahad et al., 2015). A few transgenic plant-based vaccines have
moved forward to clinical trials, but none of them reached
beyond phase I clinical trials, mainly due to low expression level
that limited their regular approval from FDA. Expressed norovirus
capsid protein VP1 in potato tubers against norovirus has been
advanced to phase I clinical trials where 20% vaccinated
volunteers produced IgG in titre range 1 : 757. It was prepared
by Arizona State University in collaboration with GMP facility
(Takeyama et al., 2015). Similarly edible vaccines against enter-
toxigenic E. coli in potato and maize have advanced to phase I
clinical trials where vaccinated volunteers produced LTB-specific
IgG and IgA. Another, rice-based cholera vaccine that was
developed in Japan is now under phase I clinical trials (Takeyama
et al., 2015).
Chloroplast transformation
Chloroplast transformation addresses some of the problems of
nuclear transformation for commercialization of plant-based
recombinant vaccines. In this method, a transgene is introduced
into the circular plant chloroplast genome through a particle gun,
resulting in site-specific integration by homologous recombina-
tion (Figure 1b) (Daniell et al., 2002). In this method, when leaves
are bombarded with gold particles coated with chloroplast
vectors,
transgene
cassette
integrates
into
the
chloroplast
genome. The expression of foreign genes is generally high, as
there are 10 000 copies of the chloroplast genome in each leaf
cell. As chloroplast genome is maternally inherited, this reduces
the risk of transgene escape via pollen. In addition, harvesting of
vegetative tissues (leaves) before flowering eliminates escape via
pollen or seeds. Therefore, transplastomic plants expressing
vaccine antigens and biopharmaceuticals have been grown in
the field (Arlen et al. 2007). USDA-APHIS has certified that
transplastomic lines do not fit the definition of a regulated article
7 CFR (part 340) because there are no pest components (Kwon
and Daniell, 2015). Moreover, expression of multiple gene is
possible under a single promoter due to polycistronic expression
(De Cosa et al. 2001; Quesada-Vargas et al. 2005). The major
regulatory element used in chloroplast transformation is the psbA
promoter, 50 untranslated region (UTR), psbA 30 untranslated
region and the most commonly used spacer region is the trn1 and
trnA (Daniell et al., 2016a,b). Such combination facilitates very
high levels of transgene expression, even up to 72% of TSP (Chan
and Daniell, 2015). Many antigens from viral and bacterial origin
has been expressed in chloroplast against different animals
diseases including polio, plague, cholera, malaria, canine par-
vovirus, tuberculosis, anthrax, FMD, rotavirus, classical swine flu
virus (Arlen et al., 2008; Gorantala et al., 2014; Lakshmi et al.,
2013; Lentz et al., 2010; Ortigosa et al., 2010; Shao et al., 2008;
Zhou et al., 2010).
Viral vectors
Another transformation system uses plant viral vectors like
cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV), tobacco mosaic virus, cowpea
mosaic virus, bamboo mosaic virus or alfalfa mosaic virus
(Figure 1c).
In
this
method,
the
plant
virus
is
genetically
engineered to be under the control of the coat protein subge-
nomic mRNA promoter. The coat protein is highly expressed in an
infected host, making it the best promoter to express foreign
genes. Copies of the infectious nucleic acid deliver the target
gene to the plant cell. They produce virus-like particles that deliver
the peptide epitope. This process of infecting most plant tissues
takes almost 3 weeks (Gleba et al., 2007). The plant virus system
has resulted in the production of vaccines against rabies in which
modified alfalfa mosaic virus CP glycoprotein G and the nucle-
oprotein were expressed by the viral vector system and conferred
protection in mice after viral challenge. Plant-based rabies
vaccines is in phase I clinical trials; five of nine volunteers
produced neutralizing antibodies against rabies virus (Rybicki,
2014; Takeyama et al., 2015). Plant viruses are independently
transcribed and translated to produce abundant proteins in a
short time (Guan et al., 2013).

 through Agrobacterium by one of two methods: injecting the
stomata of leaves or vacuum infiltration. In vacuum infiltration,
upper parts of a plant are flooded with a culture of Agrobac-
terium and a vacuum is applied to remove air from intracellular
spaces. Upon release, the vacuum delivers the target gene to
plant cells via Agrobacterium (Ling et al., 2010). Transcripts of the
recombinant viral genome enter the nucleus and cytoplasm of
plant cells. As a result, plants start producing large quantities of
the target protein within a few days (Yusibov and Rabindran,
2008). This transient expression system has produced target
proteins against Bacillus anthracis, Yersinia pestis and influenza
virus (Chichester et al., 2007; Shoji et al., 2008). Transient
expression system also resulted in the production of different
veterinary vaccines against bluetongue virus, Crimean-Congo
haemorrhagic fever virus, Ebola virus, Rift Valley fever virus with
promising results (Rybicki, 2014).
Transient expression system with both viral vector- and
agrobacterium-mediated delivery of virus replicon is the most
preferred method to achieve high level expression of foreign
genes. Transient expression system has produced a number of
medically important antigens against different diseases. The

a
modification
in
transient
expression to enhance gene expression. Ma et al. (2012) used

tobacco

virus-based
transient
expression system to produce plant-made PyMSP119 against
malaria. The highest expression level reached up to 23% of TSP
(Fahad et al., 2015; Ma et al., 2012). Larsen and Curtis (2012)
used replicating PVX vectors and a nonreplicating CPMV-HT
vector and achieved the highest expression of heterologous
protein in tobacco hairy roots almost 27.6% of TSP (Larsen and
Curtis, 2012).
Cell suspension cultures
Cell suspensions are individual cells or cell aggregates that are
derivatives of callus tissues; separated callus cells propagate to
produce a stable cell suspension (Figure 1d). Transgenic explants
or a single callus cell can produce recombinant antigens via
transformation with Agrobacterium and can then be easily scaled
up in a fermenter. In 2006, the USDA approved the world’s first
edible vaccine against poultry diseases, which was prepared in
tobacco cell suspension (Yusibov and Rabindran, 2008). In 2012,
FDA approved the first biopharmaceutical for protein made in
carrot cells—glucocerebrosidase to treat Gaucher’s disease. This
protein was developed by an Israeli company Protalix Biothera-
peutics, and FDA-approved product is now marketed by Pfizer
(Wolfson, 2013).
Strategies to enhance expression of vaccine antigens
In early work on edible vaccines, the expression level of
expressed antigen was not high, for example rotavirus VP6
protein in potatoes produced low expression 0.02% of TSP
(Matsumura et al., 2002) and infectious bronchitis S1 protein in
potatoes resulted in low expression 0.07%–0.22% of TSP (Zhou
et al., 2003). Therefore, low expression level was a major
limiting factor in the field of plant vaccines. Different strategies
have been adopted to increase expression of transformed
genes. In particular, extensive effort has been made to improve
expression
of
transgenes
to
make
edible
vaccines
more
immunogenic. One of the most common approaches is the
use of suitable promoters. The CaMV 35S promoter is consti-
tutive and is used in dicotyledonous plants. It is the promoter of
choice for expressing foreign antigens in all parts of most
dicotyledonous plants. The ubiquitin promoter is commonly
used in monocotyledonous plants, and the actin promoter is
used for rice. However, several studies have shown that foreign
gene expression may be enhanced by tissue- or organ-specific
promoters. For example, tomatoes transformed via Agrobac-
terium with the cholera toxin-B subunit (CTB) gene regulated by
the CaMV 35S promoter expressed CTB at 0.2%–0.4% of total
soluble protein (TSP). By contrast, tomato plants transformed
with the same CTB gene but under the control of the E8
tomato fruit-specific promoter expressed CTB at almost 0.8% of
TSP (Guan et al., 2013). Low expression level may be due to
prokaryotic nature of CTB but expressed via the eukaryotic
nuclear genome. So, codon optimization is another approach to
maximize the expression of foreign genes. In this approach,
codons of the foreign gene are replaced by preferred codons of
the host plant. Mason et al. (1998) studied the expression of
the native and codon-optimized heat-labile enterotoxin-B sub-
unit (LTB) gene from E. coli. Expression of the codon-optimized
LTB gene was quite high almost 0.9–12.8 lg/g of tuber and
0.17–1.85 lg/mg of total protein as compared with the native
bacterial gene (Mason et al., 1998). The use of signal peptides
also enhances expression of foreign genes. In plant cells, the
endoplasmic reticulum stabilizes foreign proteins and promotes
their maturation/processing. It has been suggested that an
endoplasmic signal peptide at the C-terminus of recombinant
proteins could enhance expression (Guan et al., 2013).
Chloroplast expression system has helped address challenges in
low expression level and a number of vaccines antigens against
cholera, tetanus, anthrax, plague, polio or canine parvovirus
achieving up to 13.17% and 10.11% of TSP in dual cholera and
malaria vaccine expressing CTB-fused apical membrane antigen 1
(AMA1) and merozoite surface protein 1 (MSP1) (Davoodi-
Semiromi et al., 2010) and >70% of TSP for CTB–proinsulin
(Ruhlman et al., 2010). These are a few illustrative examples, but
readers referred recent reviews where a more comprehensive list
of vaccine antigens or biopharmaceuticals expressed in chloro-
plasts are provided (Daniell et al., 2016a,b; Davoodi-Semiromi
et al., 2010; Jin and Daniell, 2015). When eukaryotic human or
viral genes are expressed in prokaryotic chloroplasts, expression
levels could be very low. However, codon optimization by
elimination of rare codons and use of codon usage hierarchy
from 130 sequenced chloroplast genomes has resulted in >50-
fold high level expression (Chan et al., 2016; Daniell et al.,
2016a).
Vaccine delivery systems
Parenteral delivery
Syringe and needle-based injections is the most common method
for the administration of vaccines in which vaccines can be
delivered through intradermal, intramuscular and subcutaneous
route. Vaccines are delivered in the dermis layer in intradermal
route, muscular layer below dermis in intramuscular route and
fatty tissue between dermis and muscular layer in case of
subcutaneous mode of delivery. Immune response in parenteral
delivery depends on adopted method for delivery of vaccine
antigen. The administration of inactive vaccines in most of
animals is very laborious because of intramuscular or subcuta-
neous injections. Inactive vaccines can produce very low system-
atic immunity. In humans, needle-based delivery is associated
with infections and inadequate maintenance of cold chain during
transportation (Kwon et al., 2013).

 Mucosal delivery
Our digestive tract is covered by mucosal layer, richly supplied
with blood vessels that directly enter into jugular vein. Mucosal
delivery system directly transports vaccine antigens to immune
cells in the mucosal layer and to the blood circulation system.
Oral and nasal routes are most common routes for delivery and
much more convenient for both humans and animals as
compared to injectable mode of delivery (Kwon et al., 2013).
Amani et al. (2011) reported that subcutaneous and orally
immunized mice with plant-derived
EspA, Intimin and Tir
proteins (EITs) produced significant anti-EIT IgG and faecal
IgA, but no IgA was observed in case of parenteral delivery
(Amani et al., 2011). In another study, orally immunized mice
with CTB (cholera toxin-B subunit)-fused malarial antigens
(AMA1) and (MSP1) produced antigen-specific antibodies and
showed protection against malarial parasite and cholera toxin
challenge (Davoodi-Semiromi
et al., 2010), conferring both
mucosal immunity and systemic immunity. In a recent study,
injected polio vaccine did not generate any IgA, but oral polio
vaccine made in plant cells generated both IgA and IgG1 and
neutralized all three polio serotypes (Chan et al., 2016).
Intranasal delivery is also effective as it is richly supplied by
dendritic cells (DCs). Most of live vaccines in animals are delivered
as sprays or aerosols. The major drawback of live virus vaccines is
that although they are given to animals of a specific age, the
aerosol mode of administration can unintentionally inoculate
younger or more susceptible animals, which can ultimately cause
death (Alexander, 2012; Kwon et al., 2013).
Oral delivery
Promising results of orally delivered plant-based vaccines offer a
new opportunity to address current challenges in their delivery
because gut is the largest surface area for absorption in the body.
Moreover, gut immune system is very important to control
infections because it acts as the first line of defence against
infecting pathogens (Azizi et al., 2010). Plant cell wall protects
vaccine antigens from degradation by acidic environment in
digestive system before it reaches the gut where commensal
microbes digest cell wall and release vaccine antigens in the gut
lumen (Kwon et al., 2013). Antigen uptake across the gut
epithelium is facilitated by tags fused to antigens for specific
delivery to immune cells (Xiao et al., 2016) CTB, LTB or DCs
peptides act as carriers for antigen delivery to immune cells. CTB
assembles as pentameric structures and binds to GM1 receptors
in intestinal epithelial cells. Oral delivery of plant-based vaccine
against different animal diseases has showed promising results.
Orally immunized mice with F1V antigen against plague produced
high titres of IgG1, IgA and 88% mice were protected after lethal
aerosol challenge of Yersinia pestis (Arlen et al., 2008). In another
study, orally immunized mice with plant cells produced CTB-
specific intestinal IgA and serum IgG and showed 100%
protection against cholera toxin challenge (Davoodi-Semiromi
et al., 2010). Similarly when mice and pigs were orally immunized
with E2 glycoprotein against swine flu virus, they produced the
E2-specific systematic, mucosal and cellular immune responses
(Jung et al., 2014). Similarly, orally immunized mice with H5 of
(HPAI) A against bird flu elicited high level of HA-specific
systematic IgG and mucosal IgA, strong Th1 responses together
with IgG2b production and 72% mice were protected after viral
challenge (Lee et al., 2015). Another proof for oral delivery of
plant-based vaccines was observed in orally immunized pigs
against porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome, pigs fed
with transgenic plant cells produced antigen-specific IgA and IgG
and neutralizing antibodies (Chia et al., 2010). Chan et al. (2016)
produced oral booster vaccines against poliovirus as WHO
approves complete replacement of oral polio vaccine (OPV) with
one dose of inactivated poliovirus vaccines. Oral boosting of
highly expressed VP1 gene in plant chloroplasts using plant-based
adjuvants, after single priming with IPV, produced high-titre IgG1
and IgA against VP1 protein, but IPV alone did not produce any
IgA. Two doses of IPV or single IPV priming followed by oral
boosters resulted in the production of high levels of neutralizing
antibodies against all three poliovirus Sabin serotypes. However,
single dose of IPV produced low levels of IgG1, neutralizing
antibodies but no IgA (Chan et al., 2016).
Oral vaccines against major zoonotic diseases
Viral diseases
Rabies is the most common zoonotic infection that circulates
among dogs and wild bats. It is a major cause of economic loss in
livestock industry and animals get infected by bitting of vampire
bats. A number of rabies cases in humans in Latin America have
been reported due to bat bitting. Rabies is a major public health
concern in developing countries as it caused 55 000 deaths
annually according to WHO report and millions of death in
animals (Loza-Rubio et al., 2012). Rabies infection spreads
through a virus that belongs to the family Rhabdoviridae.
Currently available vaccines are satisfactory but requirement for
refrigeration at 4 °C and high cost are serious limitations in
developing countries. Plant-based vaccines offer potential solu-
tions to these problems (Loza-Rubio et al., 2012). Transiently
expressed nucleoprotein of rabies virus produced high level
expression and was immunogenic in mice and conferred protec-
tion against rabies viral challenge (Arango et al., 2008). Singh
et al. (2015) fused ricin toxin-B chain (rgp–rtxB) with this
glycoprotein in tomato hairy roots, which produced immune
response after intramucosal immunization. The high affinity of
CTB to GM1 receptors confirmed its anticholera toxin and
antirabies antibodies (Roy et al., 2010). Plant-based rabies vac-
cines, expressed transiently in spinach, is in phase I clinical trials;
five of nine volunteers produced neutralizing antibodies against
rabies virus (Takeyama et al., 2015).
The swine flu virus belongs to the family Flaviviridae, which
causes contagious swine flu disease in pigs and is a major burden
in the livestock industry. Influenza is also a major challenge in
humans as it has been estimated that millions of people each year
are vaccinated against flu. Influenza virus infects farm animals
and transmits to humans either by direct contact or through
contaminated food. Many cases were reported where pig farmers
showed symptoms similar to swine influenza after interaction
with infected pigs. In 2009, outbreak of swine influenza caused
17 000 deaths around the world (WHO Situation updates—
Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 http://www.who.int/csr/disease/swineflu/
updates/en). Many vaccination strategies are in practice to control
swine flu fever including live attenuated vaccines but there are
some drawbacks of live vaccine including high cost of production,
virus inversion and low-temperature storage requirement. Oral
and plant-based vaccines offer alternative solutions (Jung et al.,
2014). E2 structural protein expressed in tobacco chloroplasts
conferred protective immune response in mice upon oral delivery
(Shao et al., 2008). Jung et al. (2014) also produced transgenic
rice calli expressing E2 structural protein and observed protective

 immune response in orally immunized mice; pigs generated
E2-specific systemic, mucosal and cellular immune responses.
Avian influenza is highly infectious and contagious disease that
can cause 100% mortality in livestock. As this disease is usually
spread in large farms, massive vaccinations are needed to control
disease in birds and animals. Plant-based vaccines offer the best
solution to control this disease in large animal farms (Firsov et al.,
2015). Expressed HA in endoplasmic reticulum from avian
influenza HPA1 resulted in high level expression; immunogenicity
of transgenic Arabidopsis was confirmed from orally immunized
mice with high-level HA-specific systematic IgG and mucosal IgA,
strong Th1 responses together with IgG2b production and 72%
of immunized mice were protected after viral challenge (Lee
et al., 2015). In 2009, in response to pandemic swine flu, USDA
sponsored US$100 million by funding four companies: Fraun-
hofer USA Center in Delaware, Kentucky Bioprocessing in
Owensboro, Medicago USA in North Carolina, Texas A&M
University system and G-Con from Texas, to produce 100 million
doses of influenza vaccines. Medicago Inc. developed more than
100 million doses of virus-like particles (VLP)-based influenza
vaccines against H5 strain that is now undergoing phase II clinical
trials and H5N1 transient expression-based vaccine has completed
its phase I and II clinical trials (Rybicki, 2014).
Bacterial diseases
Anthrax is the most common emerging zoonotic infection that is
spread by the bacterium Bacillus anthracis. Anthrax was used as a
biological weapon in 2001 and killed five people in the United
States. Anthrax outbreaks have been continuously recorded in
Asia, Africa and South America. Anthrax is an animal disease, but
humans get infected during hunting, through contaminated food
or direct contact with animals. Current vaccines against human
and animal anthrax are injectable protective antigen obtained
from culture filtrate on Bacillus anthracis. There are several
limitations to this vaccine, including requirement of several
boosters (up to eight) and withdrawal of certain batches due to
toxin contamination in the culture filtrate. Koya et al. (2005)
produced transplastomic tobacco by expressing the anthrax
protective antigen (PA) and observed protective immune response
in immunized mice producing high-titre IgG antibodies against
anthrax (1 : 320 000) and conferred 100% protection after
challenge with lethal dose of Bacillus anthracis. Protective
immune response was confirmed by oral feeding with transgenic
plants and challenge with lethal dose of Bacillus anthracis. Orally
immunized mice produced IgA, IgG1, IgG2a titres and showed
60%–80% protection after challenge (Gorantala et al., 2011).
Yersinia pestis, a bacterial and zoonotic pathogen, is the
causative agent of infectious plague in humans. Plague infection
can be bubonic (infection in lymph nodes), septicaemic (infection
in blood vessels) or pneumonic (infection in lungs). Plague causes
severe infection in humans with 90% mortality if remained
untreated. Animals particularly rodents are the main reservoir of
Yersinia pestis. Humans get infected by rats through fleas. Few
recent plague outbreaks have been reported, including those in
Asia. Currently available vaccines use live attenuated or killed
Y. pestis with certain risks; so there is no approved plague
vaccines in the United States, even though CDC lists this among
biological weapons (category A) (Sinclair et al., 2008). Arlen et al.
(2008) expressed high levels of F1-V in tobacco chloroplasts and
orally fed mice were highly immunogenic and showed 88%
protection after Y-pestis lethal challenge. F1-V expressed in
lettuce chloroplasts produced much lower level of antigens but
showed immunogenicity (Arlen et al., 2008; Rosales-Mendoza
et al., 2010).
Tuberculosis (TB) is zoonotic and infectious disease of bacterial
origin in both animals and humans. In 2010, TB affected 8.8 million
people and resulted in 1.5 million deaths. TB has a high mortality
rate as every minute it causes the death of four of twenty infected
people. In developed countries, TB has been mostly eliminated but
it is still a problem in most of the developing countries. M. tuber-
culosis is causative agent of TB in humans, while bovine acquires TB
infection with M. bovis. Both species are closely related. M. bovis is
risky in humans as 10% TB infection in humans is zoonotic due to
M. bovis (M€
uller et al., 2013). BCG is only available vaccine for
tuberculosis but this has several limitations; drug-resistant TB is yet
another emerging challenge. Plant-based vaccine could offer
potential solutions. Transgenic modified carrot with Mycobac-
terium tuberculosis genes cfp10, esat6 and dIFN produced very low
levels of antigen (0.035% TSP), and orally immunized mice with
transgenic carrot produced both cell-mediated and humoral
immune responses (Permyakova et al., 2015). Chloroplast trans-
formation of CTB-fused ESAT6 and Mtb72F in tobacco and lettuce
leaves produced much higher level of expression (up to 7.5% TSP)
and lyophilized plant cells could be stored at ambient temperature
for several months, thereby eliminating the cold chain and this
could facilitate development of an affordable vaccine (Lakshmi
et al., 2013).
Listeriosis is an infectious zoonotic disease in humans and
animals that is caused by the bacterium Listeria monocytogenes.
This disease is transmitted to humans through contaminated or
uncooked food. Infection can be severe in newborn, pregnant
women and individuals with weak immune system. Severe
complications lead to encephalitis. Listeriosis is a neglected
zoonotic pathogen and plant-based vaccines could offer the best
solution for Listeriosis. An attempt was made to produce plant-
based vaccine against Listeriosis in which orally immunized mice
with transgenic potato showed very promising results by signif-
icantly reducing the bacterial burden in spleen and liver after
challenge with Listeria monocytogenes (Ohya et al., 2005).
Pasteurellosis is also a common infection found in humans and
animals that is caused by the bacterium Pasteurella. It is
responsible for a huge loss in cattle and pig industry, and
infection is transmitted to humans by animals bite and contam-
inated food. An attempt to produce low-cost edible vaccines
against Pasteurellosis resulted in a significant immune response in
rabbits fed with plant-based GS60 (Lee et al., 2008).
Parasitic diseases
Toxoplasma gonidii causes congenital, neurological and ocular
Toxoplasmosis in birds, humans and mammals. It is also a
zoonotic parasitic pathogen that is transmitted to humans
through contaminated food or direct exposure to contaminated
soil; infection can be severe among pregnant women and
immunocompromised individuals (Chan and Daniell, 2015; Jones
et al., 2007). GRA4 antigen from T. gonidii was expressed in
chloroplasts; orally immunized mice with transgenic leaves
produced cellular and mucosal immune responses and reduced
cyst burden by 60% in mice brain after challenge with T. gondii
(Y�
acono et al., 2012). In another study, fusion of heat-shock
protein of LiHsp83 to SAG1 enhanced expression of SAG1 in
tobacco chloroplasts and reduced cyst load in mice upon oral
delivery (Albarrac�
ın et al., 2015).

falciparum, causing 500 million illness cases, 1 million deaths

 annually. Currently, there is no licensed vaccine and promising
results of plant-based vaccines against malaria are under devel-
opment. Davoodi-Semiromi et al. (2010) fused (CTB) Vibrio
cholerae with malarial vaccine antigens apical membrane anti-
gen-1 (AMA1) and merozoite surface protein-1 (MSP1). They
observed high level expression (up to 14% TSP) of CTB-AMA1
and CTB-MSP1 in lettuce and tobacco chloroplasts. Orally
immunized mice with CTB (cholera toxin-B subunit)-fused malar-
ial antigens (AMA1) and (MSP1) produced antigen-specific
antibodies and showed protection against malarial parasite and
cholera toxin challenge (Davoodi-Semiromi et al., 2010). Jones
et al. (2013) expressed engineered VLPs fused with Pfs25 and
alfalfa mosaic virus coat protein (Pfs25-CP VLP) in tobacco plants
using a tobacco mosaic virus-based ‘launch’ vector system.
Immunization of mice with one or two doses of purified Pfs25-
CP VLPs induced antibodies with transmission blocking activity
that was persistent for 6 months postimmunization. Similarly, in
another study, Pfs25 gene fused with lichenase (LicKM) carrier
was transiently expressed in tobacco plants; immunized mice and
rabbits with transgenic tobacco produced transmission blocking
antibodies that have been persisted up to 6 months (Jones et al.,
2015). Table 1 summarizes the plant-based oral vaccines against
zoonotic diseases.
Oral vaccines against nonzoonotic animal diseases
Health of animals is very important for security of humans as 71%
of emerging diseases in humans are due to zoonotic pathogens.
A number of successful efforts have been made to produce plant-
made veterinary vaccines against nonzoonotic pathogens that are
quite severe in animals, leading to major losses in livestock
industry. Foot-and-mouth disease is common in bovine, horse,
sheep, pig and goat that cause high fever, weight loss and
erosions in feet and mouth. This is a major challenge in livestock
economy by reducing milk and meat production (Ruiz et al.,
2015). Rao et al. (2012) produced a bivalent vaccine against foot-
and-mouth diseases expressing VP1 structural protein from two
serotypes A and O. Oral feeding of pig with transgenic plants
produced specific humoral immune response. Sera from immu-
nized pigs when challenged with FMDV neutralized the virus with
no cytopathic effect on BHK-21 cells (Rao et al., 2012). In another
approach, VP1 protein was expressed in tobacco chloroplasts
(Lentz et al., 2010). Several attempts have been made to express
BVDV in tobacco (Nelson et al., 2012), alfalfa (Aguirreburualde
et al., 2013) and Panax ginseng (Gao et al., 2015) and their
immune studies in different animal models showed promising
results.
A number of plant-based vaccines have also been made against
different animal diseases. Pig oedema causes heavy economic loss
and mortality. It mostly happens in piglets after weaning and its
neurological disorder cause sudden death of piglets. Currently, no
vaccine is available to protect pigs from oedema diseases.
Expressed antigens in plants against pig oedema disease offer
potential solutions. Orally Immunized mice and pigs with tobacco
seeds expressing Vt2e-B and FedA conferred protective immune
response against O138 E. coli, and immunized pigs showed
protection against O138 E. coli infection (Rossi et al., 2014).
Antigen expressed in tobacco (Chia et al., 2010) and banana
(Chan et al., 2013) against porcine reproductive and respiratory
syndrome (PRRSV) showed promising results.
Poultry is a major industry but unfortunately its growth is
severely threatened by a number of pathogens of both zoonotic
and nonzoonotic origin. Currently worldwide poultry production

 is almost 86 million tons and it is likely to increase to 94 million
tons in the near future. Currently emerging diseases in field of
poultry also lead to development of plant-based vaccines against
different poultry diseases. NDV, infectious bursal diseases, avian
influenza, coccidiosis are most severe diseases in poultry. Infec-
tious bursal disease is the most important disease in young
chickens that causes high mortality. Currently available vaccines
are live and killed virus, which are protective but associated with
some disadvantages. VP2 is most selected antigen in plant-based
vaccine against infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) due to its
immunogenic and virus neutralizing ability. Edible vaccines
against IBDV have been developed in tobacco (Chen et al.,
2012; G�
omez et al., 2013) and rice (Wu et al., 2007). Immunized
chickens not only produced antibodies against IBDV but also
showed protection against IBDV challenge.
Canine parvovirus causes infection in dogs and particularly in
puppies. The importance of dog cannot be denied among
domesticated animals. Currently live and killed virus-based
vaccines offer the only solution to treat dogs with CPV infection.
Live vaccines are always associated with pathogen of low
virulence that can be hazardous for dogs with weak immune
systems. Many efforts in the field of plant-based vaccines have
been made to find alternate solution to treat or prevent CPV in
dogs. Immunization of mice with CTB-2L21 and GFP-2L21
peptide from (CPV) VP2 protein (Molina et al., 2004) and 2L21-
TD (Ortigosa et al., 2010) expressed in chloroplasts generated
high titres of IgA, IgG1 antibodies against viral VP2 protein. In
another approach, antigens expressed in Arabidopsis against
rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV) (Gil et al., 2006) and in
tobacco against cottontail rabbit papillomavirus (CRPV) (Kohl
et al., 2006) showed immunogenicity and promising results.
Table 2 summarizes the plant-based vaccines against non-
zoonotic infections.
Current facilities for the production of plant-based
vaccines
The recent advancement and successful approaches to develop
plant-derived vaccines have attracted attention for creating large
commercial facilities to produce large quantities of vaccine antigens
under good manufacturing practice (cGMP) standards. The first set-
up for commercial- and large-scale production of plant-derived
vaccines was developed in 1999 and was based on transient
expression systems. After that, extensive progress was made in the
field of plant vaccines: high-level expression was achieved and the
concepts of plant virus vectors and the vacuum infiltration process
were introduced. In 2007, the Defense Advanced Research Project
Agency (DARPA) funded a project for the development of cGMP
manufacturing units for large-scale, rapid production of plant-
derivedvaccines.Afterrealizingthatlow-cost,plant-derivedvaccines
are a better tool to control many infectious diseases in humans,
DARPA financed projects at Kentucky BioProcessing (Owensboro,
KY), Medicago (Durham, NC) and Caliber Bio Therapeutics (Bryan,
TX) for the development of cGMP facilities for plant-made vaccines.
Caliber Biotherapeutics is currently the largest manufacturing facility
and can produce 3500 kg of plant material at one time under LED
illumination system, automatic hydroponic facility and high-
throughput infiltration system. LED illumination system has reduced
growth time and energy cost. Plants after 5 weeks of seeding in
automated hydroponic system under constant LED light are moved
to the infiltration area, which is 18.3-metre-long vessel with ability to
hold 7000 L infiltrate. After infiltration, plants are placed on
postinfiltration growth racks for 6-10 days, then transported to

 harvest area and finally driven to downstream area for final
purification. As a world’s largest plant-based manufacturing facil-
ity, it produced more than 100 million doses of H1N1 influenza
subunit vaccines for phase I clinical trials. This investment in cGMP
manufacturing units is a major advance in the field of plant-based
vaccines and will permit the production of large quantities of
vaccines at the time of an outbreak (Holtz et al., 2015).
Conclusions
Major efforts have been made during last decade to use plants to
express foreign antigens against various animal and human
diseases. The success of the first commercial plant-made vaccine
against NDV by Dow Agro Sciences and FDA approval of
biopharmaceutical to treat Gaucher’s disease produced in carrot
cells offer hope for rapid commercialization of plant-made
vaccines. Moreover, successful human trials of plant-based
vaccines against norovirus, influenza, rotavirus, rabies, E. coli
and HBV infections also contribute to this growing industry. Plant-
made vaccines possess all the desirable attributes of vaccines
including long-term storage and stability at room temperature.
But the main challenge in plant-based vaccines is the need for oral
priming with adjuvants. So, new techniques/concepts are needed
to overcome this challenge.
