Introduction
Honey
 is
 a
 natural
 sweetener
 that
 is
 widely
 available
 across
the
 world.
 Among
 natural
 products,
 it
 is
 extensively
 used
 for
various
 applications,
 some
 clinical
 (Ahmed
 and
 Othman,
 2013),
and
 contains
 approximately
 200
 distinct
 chemical
 compounds
(Ramanauskiene
 et
 al.,
 2012).
 Honey
 bee
 honey
 is
 a
 viscous
 solu-
tion
 containing
 various
 molecules,
 including
 fructose
 and
 glucose
(80–85%);
 water
 (15–17%);
 ash
 (0.2%);
 proteins
 and
 amino
 acids
(0.1–0.4%)
 and
 trace
 amounts
 of
 enzymes,
 vitamins
 and
 other
 sub-
stances,
 such
 as
 phenolic
 compounds.
 However,
 honey
 composition
varies
 depending
 on
 the
 types
 of
 plants
 from
 which
 the
 bee
 con-
sumes
 nectar.
 Nevertheless,
 nearly
 all
 honey
 worldwide
 contains
similar
 types
 of
 phenolic
 acids,
 including
 caffeic,
 ellagic,
 ferulic
 and
p-coumaric
 acids;
 flavonoids,
 such
 as
 apigenin,
 chrysin,
 galangin,
hesperetin,
 kaempferol,
 pinocembrin
 and
 quercetin;
 and
 antiox-
idants,
 such
 as
 tocopherols,
 ascorbic
 acid,
 superoxide
 dismutase
(SOD),
 catalase
 (CAT),
 and
 reduced
 glutathione
 (GSH).
 Each
 con-
stituent
 has
 unique
 nutritional
 and
 medicinal
 properties,
 and
 the
components
 act
 synergistically,
 lending
 honey
 utility
 in
 a
 variety
of
 applications
 (Vit
 et
 al.,
 2015a).
 Nevertheless,
 the
 physical
 prop-
erties
 and
 chemical
 composition
 of
 honeys
 fluctuate

plants
 from
 which
 the
 bees
 collect
 raw
 material.
 In
 addition,
 dif-
ferences
 in
 the
 type
 of
 flora,
 climatic
 conditions
 and
 geographical
region
 also
 influence
 honey’s
 physical
 and
 chemical
 properties.
In
 a
 recent
 study,
 different
 methods
 were
 used
 for
 discrimina-
tion
 of
 the
 entomological
 origins
 of
 sting
 bee
 and
 stingless
 bee
honeys
 (Vit
 et
 al.,
 2011,
 2015b)
 as
 well
 as
 authentication
 of
 com-
mercial
 honeys
 by
 nuclear
 magnetic
 resonance
 (Schievano
 et
 al.,
2015).
Several
 research
 studies
 of
 honey
 have
 confirmed
 its
 biological
properties,
 such
 as
 antioxidant,
 anti-inflammatory,
 anti-bacterial,
antiviral,
 anti-ulcer
 activities;
 and
 antihyperlipidemic,
 antidia-
betic
 and
 anticancer
 properties
 (Erejuwa
 et
 al.,
 2010;
 Kishore
et
 al.,
 2011;
 Viuda-Martos
 et
 al.,
 2008).
 It
 has
 been
 reported
 that
honey
 lowers
 cardiovascular
 risk
 in
 both
 healthy
 patients
 and
in
 those
 with
 increased
 risk
 factors.
 Various
 parameters,
 such
 as
plasma
 glucose,
 plasma
 insulin,
 cholesterol,
 triacylglycerides
 (TG),
blood
 lipids,
 C-reactive
 proteins
 and
 homocysteine,
 were
 inves-
tigated
 following
 in
 vivo
 administration
 of
 natural
 and
 artificial
honeys;
 natural
 honey
 was
 found
 to
 have
 significant
 ameliora-
tive
 effects
 on
 the
 aforementioned
 parameters
 (Al-Waili,
 2004).
 In
particular,
 Tualang
 (Koompassia
 excelsa)  honey
 has
 been
 reported
to
 have
 protective
 effects
 in
 learning
 and
 memory,
 including
enhanced
 morphology
 of
 memory-related
 brain
 areas,
 increased
levels
 of
 brain-derived
 neurotrophic
 factor,
 reduced
 brain
 oxidative
stress,
 increased
 acetylcholine
 concentration,
 and
 reduced

Stingless
 bee
 honey
 is
 a
 precious
 bee
 product
 of
 the
 stingless
 bee.
Stingless
 bee
 honey
 is
 different
 from
 that
 produced
 by
 the
 bees
 of
the
 genus
 Apis
 (i.e.,
 the
 honey
 bee)
 in
 terms
 of
 its
 color,
 taste
 and
viscosity
 (Almeida-Muradian
 et
 al.,
 2014;
 Guerrini
 et
 al.,
 2009).
 This
valuable
 bee
 product
 has
 traditionally
 been
 consumed
 directly
 and
used
 in
 numerous
 medical
 practices:
 both
 traditional
 methods,
 in
which
 honey
 is
 harvested
 directly
 from
 the
 forest,
 and
 in
 the
 more
well-established
 meliponary
 (Souza
 et
 al.,
 2006).

 The
 aim
 of
 this
 review
 is
 to
 summarize
 information
on
 the
 traditional
 and
 clinical
 uses
 of
 honey
 bee
 and
 stingless
bee
 honey
 to
 augment
 various
 biological
 activities
 and
 to
 treat
diseases.
Chemical
 constituents
 of
 honey
 bee
 and
 stingless
 bee
 honey
Honey
 contains
 approximately
 200
 compounds,
 such
 as
 vita-
mins,
 enzymes,
 amino
 acids
 and
 minerals,
 with
 the
 major
 content
being
 water
 and
 sugars.
 Sugars
 comprise
 approximately
 95–99%
 of
honey’s
 dry
 matter.
 Of
 the
 sugars
 in
 honey,
 fructose
 is
 the
 most
prevalent,
 comprising
 approximately
 32–38%
 of
 its
 total
 sugar.
In
 addition
 to
 fructose
 and
 glucose,
 several
 other
 disaccharides
and
 oligosaccharides,
 including
 sucrose,
 maltose,
 maltotriose
 and
panose,
 can
 be
 found.
 Organic
 acids,
 minerals
 and
 trace
 elements
such
 as
 calcium,
 potassium,
 sodium,
 magnesium,
 phosphorus,
sulphur,
 iron,
 zinc,
 copper
 and
 manganese
 are
 other
 components
present.
In
 addition,
 various
 vitamins,
 including
 ascorbic
 acid
 (Vita-
min
 C),
 thiamine
 (Vitamin
 B1),
 pantothenic
 acid
 (Vitamin
 B5),
riboflavin
 (Vitamin
 B2),
 nicotinic
 acid
 (Vitamin
 B3),
 pyridoxine
(Vitamin
 B6),
 biotin
 (Vitamin
 B8),
 folic
 acid
 (Vitamin
 B9)
 and
cyanocobalamin
 (Vitamin
 B12),
 are
 present
 (Ciulu
 et
 al.,
 2011).
Enzymes
 and
 proteins
 are
 minor
 constituents,
 with
 the
 enzymes
playing
 a
 vital
 role
 in
 various
 activities,
 including
 antimicrobial
activity
 and
 facilitating
 calcium
 absorption
 (Ariefdjohan
 et
 al.,
2008).
 Many
 studies
 have
 reported
 (Can
 et
 al.,
 2015;
 Escriche
 et
 al.,
2014;
 Flores
 et
 al.,
 2015;
 Habib
 et
 al.,
 2014)
 that
 the
 antioxidant
capacity
 of
 honey
 is
 dependent
 not
 only
 on
 the
 presence
 of
 total
phenolic
 compounds
 but
 also
 on
 the
 presence
 of
 flavonoids,
which
 play
 an
 important
 role
 in
 ameliorating
 oxidative
 stress.
Interglycosidic
 linkages
 in
 O-glycosil
 flavones
 from
 Tetragonula
carbonaria
 have
 previously
 been
 detected
 by
 high-performance
liquid
 
chromatography/photodiode-array
 
(Truchado
 
et
 
al.,
2015).
A
 variety
 of
 flavonoids
 and
 terpenoids
 have
 been
 reported
 in
various
 honeys.
 In
 manuka
 honey,
 pinocembrin
 (1),
 chrysin
 (2),
pinobanksin
 (3),
 8-methoxykaempferol
 (4),
 luteolin
 (5),
 isorham-
netin
 (6),
 galangin
 (7),
 kaempferol,
 sakuranetin
 (8),
 quercetin
 and
magniferolic
 acid
 (9)
 and
 3�-hydroxy-24-methylenecycloartan-
26-oic
 acid
 (10)
 have
 been
 identified
 (Ahmed
 and
 Othman,
 2013).
The
 various
 physicochemical
 properties
 of
 honey
 bee
 and
 sting-
less

 honey
 are
 summarized
 in

Traditional
 uses
 of
 honey
Honey
 has
 held
 a
 place
 of
 importance
 in
 traditional
 medicine
for
 ages
 (Jeffrey
 and
 Echazarreta,
 1996;
 Vit
 et
 al.,
 2004,
 2013).
 For
many
 years,
 honey
 has
 been
 a
 pivotal
 player
 as
 an
 antioxidant,
 and
it
 has
 been
 reported
 that
 honey
 can
 be
 used
 as
 a
 hepatoprotec-
tive
 and
 cardioprotective
 agent
 (EL-Kholy
 et
 al.,
 2009;
 El
 Denshary
et
 al.,
 2012;
 Erejuwa
 et
 al.,
 2012a).
 In
 addition,
 honey
 has
 protec-
tive
 effects
 against
 gastrointestinal
 ailments
 (El-Arab
 et
 al.,
 2006;
Salem,
 1981).
Honey
 is
 among
 the
 best
 wound
 healers
 available
 in
 the
 nature.
The
 ancient
 Chinese,
 Egyptians,
 Greeks,
 Assyrian
 and
 Romans
 uti-
lized
 different
 types
 of
 honey
 to
 treat
 wounds
 and
 diseases
 of
 the
intestine.
 Honey
 exerts
 known
 antibacterial
 effects
 against
 several
microorganisms,
 including
 Escherichia
 coli,
 Shigella
 spp.,
 Helicobac-
ter
 pylori
 and
 Salmonella
 spp.
 (Al
 Somal
 et
 al.,
 1994;
 McGovern
 et
 al.,
1999).
 In
 addition,
 honey
 is
 reported
 to
 have
 anti-inflammatory
(Kassim
 et
 al.,
 2010;
 Nasuti
 et
 al.,
 2006)
 and
 anti-cancer
 activities
against
 breast,
 cervical
 (Fauzi
 et
 al.,
 2011)
 and
 prostate
 cancers
(Samarghandian
 et
 al.,
 2011)
 as
 well
 as
 osteosarcoma
 (Ghashm
et
 al.,
 2010).
 Furthermore,
 honey
 is
 traditionally
 used
 as
 an
anti-diabetic
 (Erejuwa
 et
 al.,
 2012b)
 and
 hypolipidemic
 agent
(Adnan
 et
 al.,
 2011)
 and
 to
 ameliorate
 thyroid
 disturbances
(Adewoye
 and
 Omolekulo,
 2014).
Antimicrobial

study
 revealed
 that
 T.
 angustula
 honey
 has
 significant
 antimicrobial
activity
 against
 several
 different
 bacterial
 strains,
 including
 Bacil-
lus
 cereus
 (Gram
 positive
 bacteria)
 and
 Pseudomonas
 aeruginosa
(Gram
 negative
 bacteria),
 as
 well
 as
 against
 yeasts
 such
 as
 Candida
albicans
 and
 Saccharomyces
 cerevisiae
 (DeMera
 and
 Angert,
 2004).
A
 recent
 study
 has
 confirmed
 the
 antibacterial
 activity
 of
 T.
 angus-
tula
 honey
 on
 Gram
 positive
 bacteria
 such
 as
 Staphylococcus
 aureus
and
 Enterococcus
 faecali,
 as
 well
 as
 coagulase-negative
 methicillin-
sensitive
 and
 Gram
 negative
 bacteria
 such
 as
 P.
 aeruginosa
 and
 E.
 coli
(Sgariglia
 et
 al.,
 2010).
A
 recent
 study
 reported
 that
 the
 eleven
 types
 of
 stingless
 bee
honey,
 including
 that
 of
 Trigona
 carbonaria,  have
 potential
 antimi-
crobial
 activity
 against
 several
 types
 of
 microorganisms
 collected
from
 thirteen
 clinical
 samples
 in
 addition
 to
 standard
 reference
strains
 (Boorn
 et
 al.,
 2010).
 Furthermore,
 Trigona
 laeviceps,
 a
 stin-
gless
 bee
 found
 in
 Thailand,
 produces
 honey
 with
 antimicrobial
activity
 against
 several
 types
 of
 bacteria
 (E.
 coli
 and
 S.
 aureus)  and
the
 fungal
 strain
 Aspergillus
 niger,
 as
 well
 as
 two
 types
 of
 yeasts
(Auriobasidium
 pullulans
 and
 C.
 albicans)
 (Chanchao,
 2009).
Honey
 bee
 honey
 also
 displays
 a
 wide
 range
 of
 antimicro-
bial
 activities
 against
 various
 types
 of
 bacteria,
 fungi
 and
 viruses
(Aggad
 and
 Guemour,
 2014;
 Cooper
 et
 al.,
 1999;
 Nasir
 et
 al.,
 2010).
Manuka
 honey
 is
 one
 of
 the
 most
 potent
 and
 well-investigated
honeys
 for
 its
 antimicrobial
 and
 wound
 healing
 activities
 (Al
 Somal
et
 al.,
 1994;
 Willix
 et
 al.,
 1992).
 Tualang
 honey
 from
 Malaysia
 was
also
 reported
 to
 have
 significant
 antimicrobial
 and
 wound
 heal-
ing
 activities
 (Bergman
 et
 al.,
 1983;
 Efem,
 1988).
 In
 our
 previous
study
 (Tan
 et
 al.,
 2009),
 both
 Tualang
 and
 Manuka
 honey
 were
Q2
effective
 against
 Stenotrophomonas
 maltophilia. However,
 Tualang
honey
 had
 a
 lower
 MIC
 (11.25%)
 against
 Acinetobacter
 baumannii
compared
 with
 manuka
 honey
 (12.5%).
Antioxidant
 activities
Two
 types
 of
 stingless
 bee
 honeys
 (T.
 angustula
 and
 Plebeia
wittmanni)  have
 been
 reported
 to
 have
 good
 antioxidant
 activ-
ity
 (Vattuone
 et
 al.,
 2007).
 A
 study
 conducted
 in
 the
 Northeastern
regions
 of
 Brazil
 revealed
 that
 stingless
 bee
 honey
 from
 Melipona
(Michmelia)
 seminigra
 merrillae
 possesses
 antioxidant
 potential
 (da
Silva
 et
 al.,
 2013).
 Furthermore,
 T.
 carbonaria,  Melipona
 fasciculate,
Melipona
 subnitida
 and
 Melipona
 aff.
 Fuscopilosa
 honeys
 showed
 sig-
nificant
 antioxidant
 activity
 in
 vitro.
 Among
 all
 stingless
 bee
 honey
samples,
 T.
 carbonaria
 had
 the
 best
 antioxidant
 activities,
 indicating
that
 the
 antioxidant
 potential
 of
 honey
 varies
 based
 on
 type.
Several
 studies
 have
 indicated
 that
 honey
 bees
 from
 differ-
ent
 geographical
 regions
 have
 sufficient
 but
 variable
 antioxidant
activity.
 In
 a
 study
 by
 Kishore
 et
 al.
 (2011),
 it
 was
 reported
 that
the
 radical
 scavenging
 activity
 of
 Tualang
 honey
 bees
 is
 high,
and
 their
 honey
 had
 the
 highest
 antioxidant
 activity
 among
 the
honey
 types
 compared.
 Tualang
 honey
 collected
 from
 forests
in
 Malaysia
 showed
 substantial
 antioxidant
 activity,
 as
 indi-
cated
 by
 several
 tests
 including
 the
 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazil
(DPPH)
 and
 FRAP
 assay
 (Henderson
 et
 al.,
 2015),
 ORAC
 assay
(The
 Oxygen
 Radical
 Absorbance
 Capacity),
 ABTS
 [2,2-azinobis
(3-ehtylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic
 acid)
 diammonium
 salt
 assay,
TEAC
 (Trolox-equivalent
 antioxidant
 capacity)
 assay
 and
 ascorbic
acid
 content
 assay
 (Bashkaran
 et
 al.,
 2011;
 Erejuwa
 et
 al.,
 2012a;
Ferreira
 et
 al.,
 2009;
 Khalil
 et
 al.,
 2012,
 2015;
 Mariana
 and
 Patricia;
Q3
Moniruzzaman
 et
 al.,
 2012,
 2013,
 2014).
 Algerian
 and
 Bangladesh
honeys
 have
 also
 been
 reported
 to
 have
 good
 antioxidant
 activ-
ity
 (Khalil
 et
 al.,
 2012;
 Moniruzzaman
 et
 al.,
 2014).
 Flavonoids
 and
polyphenols
 found
 in
 honey
 also
 have
 been
 reported
 to
 have
 antiox-
idant
 activity
 (Pérez-Pérez
 et
 al.,
 2013).
Anti-inflammatory
 activity
Melipona
 marginata
 is
 an
 endangered
 stingless
 bee
 species
 from
Brazil.
 It
 produces
 honey
 with
 unique
 physicochemical
 properties
and
 a
 distinctive
 flavor.
 In
 one
 study,
 the
 honey
 extracted
 from
 M.
marginata
 showed
 anti-inflammatory
 effects
 when
 applied
 to
 the
skin
 (Borsato
 et
 al.,
 2014).
The
 efficacy
 of
 Manuka
 honey
 and
 its
 components
 as
 anti-
inflammatory
 agents
 have
 also
 been
 reported.
 The
 production
 of
various
 inflammatory
 cytokines
 has
 been
 assessed
 by
 exposing
human
 monocytes
 to
 Manuka
 honey
 (Tonks
 et
 al.,
 2003).
 The
 results
of
 this
 study
 revealed
 that
 the
 honey
 stimulated
 the
 production
of
 inflammatory
 cytokines
 interleukin-1�  (IL-1�)
 and
 IL-6
 as
 well
as
 tumor
 necrosis
 factor-�
 (TNF-�)
 through
 a
 toll-like
 receptor
 4
(TLR4)-dependent
 pathway.
 In
 particular,
 one
 of
 the
 main
 com-
ponents
 of
 Manuka
 honey,
 a
 protein
 with
 a
 molecular
 weight
 of
5.8
 kDa,
 is
 reported
 to
 be
 responsible
 for
 the
 stimulation
 of
 different
types
 of
 cytokines
 in
 human
 monocytes
 through
 the
 TLR4
 pathway
(Tonks
 et
 al.,
 2007).
Tualang
 honey
 has
 been
 shown
 to
 possess
 anti-inflammatory
activities
 in
 animals.
 The
 administration
 of
 Tualang
 honey
 to
 a
chemically
 induced
 injury
 on
 rabbit
 cornea
 yielded
 effects
 sim-
ilar
 to
 those
 of
 conventional
 treatment
 (Bashkaran
 et
 al.,
 2011)
indicating
 its
 potential
 to
 treat
 ailments
 of
 the
 eye.
 Another
 study
reported
 the
 effects
 of
 Tualang
 honey
 on
 early
 biomarkers
 of
photocarcinogenesis
 in
 the
 PAM212
 mouse
 keratinocyte
 cell
 line.
Keratinocytes
 treated
 with
 Tualang
 honey
 were
 protected
 against
exposure
 to
 ultraviolet-B
 radiation.
 The
 same
 study
 also
 noted
the
 anti-inflammatory
 capacity
 of
 Tualang
 honey
 (Ahmad
 et
 al.,
2012).
Eye
 diseases
Stingless
 bee
 honey
 also
 plays
 an
 important
 role
 in
 treat-
ing
 chemically
 induced
 cataracts.
 Honey
 from
 the
 stingless
 bee
Melipona
 favosa
 favosa
 exhibited
 activity
 against
 sodium
 selenite-
induced
 cataracts
 in
 Wistar
 rats.
 Furthermore,
 the
 application
 of
stingless
 bee
 honey
 as
 an
 eye
 wash
 agent
 has
 led
 to
 the
 retardation
of
 selenite-induced
 cataracts
 in
 rats
 (Patricia,
 2002).
 In
 addition,
Meliponini
 honey
 has
 been
 used
 as
 an
 eyedropper
 to
 treat
 eyesight
 Q4
problems.
 Honey
 from
 the
 stingless
 bee
 species
 Tetragonisca
 is
 also
used
 in
 the
 treatment
 of
 glaucoma
 and
 cataracts
 (Costa-Neto
 and
Oliveira,
 2000).
Gastrointestinal
 tract
 diseases
Another
 important
 medicinal
 use
 of
 honey
 is
 in
 the
 treatment
of
 gastrointestinal
 tract
 diseases.
 Some
 honey
 preparations
 have
shown
 beneficial
 effects
 in
 dyspepsia
 and
 in
 the
 treatment
 of
 peri-
odontal
 diseases.
 Honey
 also
 has
 beneficial
 effects
 in
 children
 with
gastroenteritis.
 The
 continuous
 treatment
 with
 honey
 of
 a
 group
 of
children
 resulted
 in
 a
 reduction
 in
 the
 duration
 of
 diarrhea
 (Haffejee
and
 Moosa,
 1985).
 One
 study
 reported
 the
 potential
 of
 honey
 to
treat
 ethanol-induced
 increased
 vascular
 permeability
 and
 gas-
trointestinal
 disturbances
 (Ali
 and
 Al-Swayeh,
 1997).
 Nevertheless,
to
 our
 knowledge,
 no
 scientific
 report
 is
 available
 on
 the
 utility
 of
stingless
 bee
 honey
 for
 treating
 gastrointestinal
 disorders.
Neurological
 disorders
Oxidative
 stress
 is
 one
 of
 the
 major
 causes
 of
 neuroinflamma-
tion,
 which
 leads
 to
 neuronal
 apoptosis
 and
 death.
 A
 recent
 study
on
 Tualang
 honey
 from
 Malaysia
 in
 the
 context
 of
 neurodegener-
ative
 disorders
 reported
 that
 honey
 may
 have
 significant
 activity
against
 chronic
 cerebral
 hypoperfusion,
 which
 is
 one
 of
 several
factors
 contributing
 to
 Alzheimer’s
 disease
 (Saxena
 et
 al.,
 2014).

Several
 studies
 have
 confirmed
 the
 beneficial
 effects
 of
 honey
 on
memory
 and
 learning
 processes.
 A
 long-term
 study
 on
 the
 effi-
cacy
 of
 honey
 in
 treating
 dementia
 in
 humans
 found
 that
 honey
and
 the
 components
 present
 in
 honey
 may
 prevent
 dementia
and
 other
 cognitive
 diseases
 (Al-Himyari,
 2009).
 Another
 study
 in
which
 honey
 was
 continuously
 administered
 to
 animals
 revealed
that
 memory
 is
 enhanced
 and
 there
 is
 increased
 proliferation
 of
neurons
 in
 hippocampal
 regions
 (Al-Rahbi
 et
 al.,
 2014).
 However,
to
 our
 knowledge,
 there
 is
 lack
 of
 investigation
 of
 the
 neurolog-
ical
 effects
 of
 stingless
 bee
 honey;
 thus,
 more
 studies
 should
 be
conducted.
Effect
 on
 fertility
Honey
 has
 beneficial
 effects
 on
 fertility
 as
 well
 as
 in
 ameliorat-
ing
 the
 hormones
 related
 to
 fertility.
 A
 recent
 study
 on
 rats
 exposed
to
 auditory
 stress
 reported
 that
 a
 decrease
 in
 fertility
 could
 be
ameliorated
 with
 0.2
 ml
 of
 5%
 honey
 dissolved
 in
 water.
 Noise
 is
a
 natural
 teratogenic
 factor
 that
 severely
 impacts
 human
 health,
reproductive
 fitness,
 and
 the
 function
 of
 reproductive
 organs.
 This
study
 indicated
 that
 honey
 consumption
 ameliorated
 altered
 lev-
els
 of
 follicle
 stimulating
 hormone
 (FSH),
 luteinizing
 hormone
(LH),
 and
 testosterone.
 In
 addition,
 positive
 effects
 of
 vitamin
 E
 on
these
 parameters
 have
 been
 reported
 (Rajabzadeh
 et
 al.,
 2015a;
Q5
Rajabzadeh
 et
 al.,
 2015b).
Stress
 plays
 a
 vital
 role
 in
 many
 diseases,
 disorders
 and
 dysfunc-
tions.
 Alterations
 in
 reproductive
 function
 are
 a
 common
 feature
of
 increased
 levels
 of
 stress.
 In
 one
 study,
 the
 administration
of
 Tualang
 honey
 to
 restraint-stressed
 pregnant
 rats
 at
 1.2
 g/kg
daily
 conferred
 beneficial
 effects
 on
 various
 parameters,
 such
 as
corticosterone
 level,
 pregnancy
 outcome
 and
 adrenal
 histomor-
phometry
 (Haron
 et
 al.,
 2014).
 Mosavat
 et
 al.
 (2014)
 reported
 that
honey
 supplementation
 at
 1
 g/kg
 resulted
 in
 a
 significant
 restor-
ative
 effect
 on
 altered
 gonadotropin
 levels
 in
 female
 rats
 (Mosavat
et
 al.,
 2014).
 Another
 study
 reported
 that
 smoke-induced
 repro-
ductive
 toxicity
 was
 ameliorated
 by
 the
 oral
 administration
 of
honey
 at
 1.2
 g/kg/day,
 which
 improved
 the
 percentage
 of
 success-
ful
 intromission
 and
 ejaculation
 in
 rats.
 By
 extension,
 this
 results
 in
increased
 fertility
 and
 mating
 rates
 (Mohamed
 et
 al.,
 2013).
 How-
ever,
 to
 our
 knowledge,
 reports
 on
 the
 effects
 of
 stingless
 bee
 honey
on
 fertility
 are
 lacking,
 and
 the
 possible
 effects
 require
 further
investigation.
Antidiabetic
 activity
The
 antihyperglycemic
 effects
 of
 honey
 in
 rabbits
 with
 chemi-
cally
 induced
 diabetes
 have
 been
 confirmed.
 One
 study
 found
 that
different
 doses
 of
 honey
 (as
 low
 as
 5
 ml/kg)
 produced
 a
 significant
reduction
 in
 blood
 glucose
 levels
 and
 other
 related
 parameters.
The
 study
 indicated
 that
 even
 at
 low
 doses
 (5
 ml/kg),
 honey
 may
be
 a
 good
 alternative
 to
 sucrose
 as
 a
 natural
 sweetener
 for
 dia-
betic
 patients
 (Akhtar
 and
 Khan,
 1989).
 Honey
 and
 its
 components
were
 found
 to
 have
 several
 health
 benefits
 with
 long-term
 usage.
Honey
 showed
 beneficial
 effects
 in
 one
 report,
 including
 weight
improvement
 and
 reduction
 in
 blood
 glucose
 levels.
Honey
 contains
 a
 high
 concentration
 of
 fructose,
 a
 monosac-
charide
 capable
 of
 elevating
 blood
 glucose
 levels
 through
 oral
absorption.
 It
 is
 therefore
 a
 paradox
 that
 researchers
 and
 nutrition-
ists
 have
 encouraged
 the
 use
 of
 honey
 as
 a
 nutrition
 supplement
in
 diabetic
 individuals
 (Adesoji
 and
 Oluwakemi,
 2008).
 A
 recent
review
 has
 been
 published
 with
 a
 detailed
 information
 on
 the
antidiabetic
 action
 of
 honey
 (Erejuwa
 et
 al.,
 2012b).
 To
 our
 knowl-
edge,
 no
 data
 have
 been
 reported
 on
 the
 antidiabetic
 activities
 of
stingless
 bee
 honey.
Anticancer
 activity
Cancer
 is
 one
 of
 the
 most
 important
 and
 dreadful
 diseases.
Numerous
 studies
 (Fauzi
 et
 al.,
 2011;
 Hawley
 et
 al.,
 2014;
Kustiawan
 et
 al.,
 2014;
 Othman,
 2012)
 on
 the
 efficacy
 of
 honey
on
 various
 types
 of
 cancers
 have
 shown
 that
 honey
 has
 debrid-
ing
 potential
 and
 stimulates
 angiogenic
 action.
 A
 study
 on
 the
efficacy
 of
 honey
 against
 cancerous
 cells
 regarding
 their
 stability,
viability
 and
 even
 metastasis
 showed
 significant
 anti-angiogenic
effects
 (Fauzi
 et
 al.,
 2011).
 Several
 studies
 on
 honeys
 from
 Malaysia
reported
 good
 activities
 against
 various
 cancers,
 including
 oral,
bladder
 (Swellam
 et
 al.,
 2003),
 cervical
 (Fauzi
 et
 al.,
 2011),
 liver
(Baig
 and
 Attique,
 2014),
 bone
 and
 breast
 (Fauzi
 et
 al.,
 2011)
 can-
cers.
Experimental
 evidence
 also
 shows
 that
 Tualang
 honey
 protects
non-cancerous
 cells
 from
 the
 adverse
 effects
 of
 tamoxifen
 through
a
 DNA
 repair
 mechanism
 in
 Michigan
 Cancer
 Foundation
 10
 A
(MCF-10A)
 cells
 compared
 with
 MCF-7
 cells
 (Yaacob
 and
 Ismail,
2014).
 In
 addition,
 Manuka
 honey
 has
 been
 reported
 to
 possess
anticancer
 activities
 (Fernandez-Cabezudo
 et
 al.,
 2013).
 A
 study
on
 the
 effect
 of
 Manuka
 honey
 on
 improving
 post-radiation
 symp-
toms
 of
 esophagitis
 indicated
 its
 preventive
 effect
 on
 lung
 cancer
(Berk
 et
 al.,
 2014).
 In
 a
 study
 related
 to
 squamous
 cell
 carcinoma,
Manuka
 honey
 exhibited
 significant
 preventive
 effects,
 including
 a
reduction
 in
 inflammation
 and
 odor
 from
 wounds
 in
 the
 oral
 cav-
ity
 (Drain
 and
 Fleming,
 2015).
 To
 our
 knowledge,
 although
 reports
on
 the
 anticancer
 effects
 of
 stingless
 bee
 propolis
 are
 available
(Choudhari
 et
 al.,
 2013;
 Kustiawan
 et
 al.,
 2014),
 the
 information
 on
the
 anticancer
 effects
 of
 stingless
 bee
 honey
 is
 lacking
 and
 further
investigation
 is
 required.
Cholesterol
 and
 lipid-lowering
 effects
 in
 cardiovascular
 diseases
One
 of
 the
 most
 noticeable
 applications
 of
 honey
 is
 in
 reduc-
ing
 cholesterol
 levels
 in
 hyperlipidemic
 patients.
 For
 example,
 the
continuous
 administration
 of
 75
 g
 of
 honey
 dissolved
 in
 250
 ml
water
 for
 15
 days
 significantly
 reduced
 lipid
 levels
 (Al-Waili,
 2004).
Another
 study
 by
 Yaghoobi
 et
 al.
 (2008)
 reported
 the
 effects
 of
honey
 on
 fasting
 blood
 glucose
 (FBG),
 body
 weights,
 low-density
lipoprotein
 cholesterol
 (LDL-C),
 total
 cholesterol,
 high-density
lipoprotein
 cholesterol
 (HDL-C),
 triacylglycerol,
 and
 C-reactive
 pro-
tein
 (CRP)
 in
 55
 patients
 and
 showed
 that
 oral
 administration
of
 70
 g
 of
 honey
 for
 30
 days
 leads
 to
 a
 reduction
 in
 LDL,
 tri-
acylglycerols,
 and
 cholesterol
 in
 overweight
 patients
 (Yaghoobi
et
 al.,
 2008).
 In
 addition,
 HDL-C
 levels
 were
 elevated
 following
the
 consumption
 of
 10%
 honey
 over
 a
 prolonged
 period
 of
 time,
suggesting
 that
 regular
 honey
 consumption
 has
 the
 health
 bene-
fits
 of
 glycemic
 control
 and
 an
 improvement
 in
 the
 lipid
 profile,
which
 directly
 or
 indirectly
 leads
 to
 a
 reduction
 in
 the
 occurrence
of
 cardiovascular
 disease
 (Chepulis
 and
 Starkey,
 2008).
 Tualang
honey
 administration
 (3
 g/kg/day)
 for
 45
 days
 showed
 an
 effect
on
 myocardial
 ischemia
 in
 rats.

Wound
 healing
 activity
Many
 studies
 have
 examined
 the
 wound
 healing
 effects
 of
honey.
 The
 wound
 healing
 activity
 of
 honey
 on
 experimental
 mice,
which
 received
 topical
 application
 of
 honey,
 has
 been
 positive.
Histopathology
 findings
 showed
 significant
 improvement
 in
 gran-
ulation
 tissue
 thickness
 and
 open
 wound
 size.
 This
 study
 also
suggested
 that
 the
 topical
 application
 of
 honey
 to
 wounds
 may
exhibit
 a
 wound
 healing
 capacity
 (Bergman
 et
 al.,
 1983).
 In
 a
human
 study
 of
 59
 patients,
 honey
 was
 found
 to

healing.
 Honey
 also
 acts
 as
 debriding
 agent
 when
 applied
 directly
to
 a
 wound.
 One
 study
 reported
 that
 honey
 ameliorates
 granula-
tion
 tissue
 thickness,
 epithelialization,
 and
 edema
 around
 wounds
(Efem,
 1988).
A
 randomized
 clinical
 study
 of
 25
 patients
 with
 wounds
 was
conducted
 to
 investigate
 the
 efficacy
 of
 honey
 for
 wound
 healing.
This
 study
 indicated
 that
 honey
 heals
 wounds
 rapidly
 and
 acts
 as
an
 antiseptic
 agent
 (Subrahmanyam,
 1998).
 A
 study
 by
 Cooper
 et
 al.
(1999)
 demonstrated
 the
 antibacterial
 effects
 of
 Manuka
 honey
 on
wounds
 (Alvarez-Suarez
 et
 al.,
 2014;
 Cooper
 et
 al.,
 1999).
 Another
study
 revealed
 the
 substantial
 antimicrobial
 activity
 of
 Australian
stingless
 bee
 honey
 and
 suggested
 that
 stingless
 bee
 honey
 would
also
 possess
 wound
 healing
 activity
 (Boorn
 et
 al.,
 2010).
Conclusions
 and
 future
 prospects
Honey
 possesses
 numerous
 biological,
 biochemical
 and
 phys-
iological
 activities
 in
 animals
 as
 well
 as
 in
 humans.
 The
 efficacy
of
 these
 properties
 depends
 on
 the
 types
 of
 phenolic
 com-
pounds
 present
 in
 the
 honey.
 Different
 types
 of
 honey
 have
 been
investigated
 for
 their
 antimicrobial,
 anticancer,
 antidiabetic,
 anti-
hypercholesterolemic,
 anti-inflammatory,
 antioxidant,
 and
 wound
healing
 properties.
 Unfortunately,
 research
 on
 stingless
 bee
 honey
has
 not
 been
 conducted
 systematically,
 so
 little
 information
 is
 avail-
able.
 A
 small
 number
 of
 reports
 have
 documented
 the
 beneficial
effects
 of
 stingless
 bee
 honey
 in
 different
 contexts,
 such
 as
 antimi-
crobial,
 antioxidant,
 and
 cataract
 studies
 and
 anti-inflammatory
activity.
 The
 information
 provided
 in
 this
 review
 makes
 clear
the
 need
 for
 evaluation
 of
 the
 many
 potential
 biological
 and
pharmacological
 activities
 of
 stingless
 bee
 honey,
 including
 in
the
 treatment
 of
 diabetes,
 metabolic
 and
 neurological
 disorders,
cancer,
 cardiovascular-disease-related
 complications
 and
 hyper-
cholesterolemia
 and
 in
 wound
 healing.
