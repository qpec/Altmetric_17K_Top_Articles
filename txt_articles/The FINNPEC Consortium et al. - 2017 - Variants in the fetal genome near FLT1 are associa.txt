 Preeclampsia, which affects approximately 5% of pregnancies, is a leading cause of maternal and 
43 
perinatal death1.  The causes of preeclampsia remain unclear, but there is evidence for inherited 
44 
susceptibility2.  Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have not identified maternal sequence 
45 
variants of genome-wide significance which replicate in independent datasets3,4.  We report the 
46 
first GWAS of offspring of preeclamptic pregnancies and discovery of the first genome-wide 
47 
significant susceptibility locus (rs4769613; P = 5.4x10-11) in 4380 cases and 310,238 controls. The 
48 
locus is near the gene encoding Fms-like tyrosine kinase 1 (FLT1), providing biological support 
49 
since an isoform (sFlt-1) of placental origin is implicated in the pathology of preeclampsia5. The 
50 
strongest association is in pregnancies where preeclampsia developed in late gestation and 
51 
offspring birthweights exceeded the 10th centile. An additional nearby variant, rs12050029, 
52 
associates with preeclampsia independent of rs4769613. The newly discovered locus may enhance 
53 
understanding of the pathophysiology of preeclampsia and its subtypes. 
54 
 
55 
Our initial GWAS meta-analysis tested 7,476,169 sequence variants in 2,658 offspring of 
56 
preeclamptic pregnancies and 308,292 controls of European descent from Iceland (deCODE cohort) 
57 
and the UK (GOPEC and ALSPAC cohorts). We observed a single genome-wide significant association  
58 
(P=3.2×10-8, rs4769613) located on chromosome 13 near the FLT1 gene (Fig. 1a). We genotyped 
59 
rs4769613 and a correlated surrogate in 1722 independent cases and 1946 controls from Norway 
60 
and Finland along with 26 variants marking GWAS meta-analysis signals elsewhere in the genome 
61 
whose P values showed suggestive evidence of association (Supplementary Table 1).  rs4769613 was 
62 
significantly associated with preeclampsia in the replication datasets (P=3.6×10-4) and joint analysis 
63 
of GWAS and replication data yielded robust genome-wide association (P=5.4×10-11) with an allelic 
64 
odds ratio (OR) of 1.21 for allele C (Table 1).  Forest plots show the frequency of allele C is 
65 
consistently elevated in cases in all GWAS and replication datasets with no evidence of 
66 
heterogeneity (Phet=0.678; Supplementary Fig. 1). None of the other genotyped loci achieved 
67 
genome-wide significance (P<5x10-8) in joint analysis of GWAS and replication data.    
68 
 
69 
We then examined genomic features of the FLT1 locus in detail (Fig. 1b) and found that some of the 
70 
association signal remained after conditioning out the effect of rs4769613 (Fig 1b, bottom panel). 
71 
This suggested that other variants near FLT1 might associate with preeclampsia independent of 
72 
rs4769613. We therefore genotyped the replication datasets for 21 additional variants at the FLT1 
73 
locus, representing 9 linkage disequilibrium (LD) blocks (Supplementary Table 2; Supplementary Fig. 
74 
2). rs12050029 and surrogates in the same LD block were significant in combined analysis of GWAS 
75 
and replication data after FLT1 region-wide correction for testing all common variants within 1 Mb of 
76 
rs4769613 (P=3.9×10-6, Table 1). Table 1 shows that rs149427560 also achieved FLT1 region-wide 
77 
significance but with an association signal weaker than rs12050029. In summary, our results imply 
78 
that in addition to rs4769613, other independent variants near FLT1 may modulate preeclampsia 
79 
susceptibility.  
80 
As expected if risk allele rs4769613[C] increases susceptibility by acting through the fetal genome, 
81 
Supplementary Table 3 shows that allele C frequency  in preeclampsia mothers  is midway between 
82 
control frequency and the significantly elevated frequency in preeclampsia offspring. Preeclampsia 
83 
offspring also preferentially inherited rs4769613[C] from heterozygous parents in the only dataset 
84 
with DNA available for both parents, again implying that rs4769613[C] increases susceptibility by 
85 
acting on the fetal genome (Supplementary Table 4). To examine if rs4769613 exerts effects on both 
86 
 the fetal and maternal genomes, we applied the EMIM algorithm which simultaneously evaluates 
87 
maternal cases, offspring and controls to calculate ORs for preeclampsia risk corresponding to one or 
88 
two risk alleles carried in the fetus (R1, R2) or in the mother (S1, S2) 6. Fig. 2a shows that fetal ORs are 
89 
above 1.0 and that each fetal copy of rs4769613[C] increases these ORs. By contrast, maternal ORs 
90 
are near 1.0 and are not significant. We conclude that rs4769613 exerts influence primarily through 
91 
the fetal genome. 
92 
 
93 
As there is evidence that genetic imprinting may operate in placental development7 we examined 
94 
rs4769613 allele transmissions from heterozygous parents, but found no parental gender difference 
95 
in allele transmission in preeclampsia and hence no evidence for imprinting (χ2=0.046, P=0.83; 
96 
Supplementary Table 5).   We also applied EMIM6  to meta-analyse cohorts with available DNA from 
97 
one or both parents, but again found no evidence that maternal and paternal alleles at rs4769613 
98 
confer differential preeclampsia risk (P=0.90). 
99 
 
100 
Sub-classifications of preeclampsia are based on clinical features, in particular gestation at diagnosis 
101 
and evidence of fetal growth restriction (FGR)8. Early-onset preeclampsia (EO-preeclampsia), 
102 
affecting 12-15% of all preeclamptic pregnancies and defined as onset before 34 weeks gestation, is 
103 
associated with higher maternal and perinatal mortality than later onset preeclampsia (LO-
104 
preeclampsia). It has been proposed that LO-preeclampsia results predominantly from maternal 
105 
maladaptation to the physiological stresses of pregnancy, whilst EO-preeclampsia is primarily the 
106 
result of sub-optimal placental implantation into the uterine wall, leading to inadequate placental 
107 
perfusion and the release of damaging placental factors into the maternal circulation8.  In keeping 
108 
with this, EO-preeclampsia is frequently associated with FGR, resulting in babies who are small for 
109 
gestational age (SGA) at birth. SGA defined as birthweight <10th centile is widely used as a surrogate 
110 
for FGR. 
111 
To assess the impact of rs4769613 on gestation at onset and fetal growth subtypes we noted that 
112 
rs4769613 risk allele C had higher frequency in LO-preeclampsia than EO-preeclampsia cases (case-
113 
control OR 1.23 vs. 1.06) and found the difference was significant in case-case meta-analysis 
114 
(P=0.017, Fig. 2b). Similarly, allele C had higher frequency in nonSGA-preeclampsia than SGA-
115 
preeclampsia cases (case-control OR 1.25 vs 1.10) and the difference was significant in case-case 
116 
comparison (P=0.019, Fig. 2b).  Further division of cases in Fig 2b into the four possible subcategories 
117 
found that rs4769613 [C] confers greatest risk to LO+nonSGA cases (case-control OR=1.26, P=1.2×10-
118 
7) and least risk to EO+SGA cases (case-control OR=1.03, P=0.72) with case-case comparison of the 
119 
two subcategories being significant (P=5.8×10-3). In summary, the results indicate that rs4769613 
120 
exerts its greatest influence in pregnancies where preeclampsia develops in late gestation and 
121 
birthweights exceed the 10th centile. rs12050029 was also associated with LO-preeclampsia, but the 
122 
strength of the association did not differ between SGA- and nonSGA-preeclampsia (Supplementary 
123 
Fig. 3). 
124 
 
125 
FLT1 encodes a trans-membrane tyrosine kinase receptor Flt-1 that mediates angiogenesis 
126 
promoted by binding vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGFA) and placental growth factor (PlGF)9. 
127 
The alternatively spliced soluble isoform sFlt-1 antagonizes angiogenesis by also binding VEGFA and 
128 
PlGF. During pregnancy, FLT1 is mainly expressed in fetal trophoblasts which release sFlt-1 as the 
129 
most abundant isoform into the maternal circulation.   The excessive release of sFlt-1 in 
130 
 preeclampsia appears to mediate widespread maternal endothelial dysfunction, manifesting as 
131 
hypertension, proteinuria, and vascular compromise to major organs. High sFlt-1 and low PlGF 
132 
concentrations are established markers of EO-preeclampsia8, but our evidence that FLT1 
133 
polymorphisms are strongly associated with LO-preeclampsia suggests trophoblast function is also 
134 
important in this preeclampsia subgroup. 
135 
 
136 
The signals around rs4769613 and rs12050029 are both located in placental enhancer regions (Fig. 
137 
1b) suggesting a mechanism by which variants could affect FLT1 expression. We explored possible 
138 
association between fetal FLT1 genotype and protein expression by placental immunohistochemistry 
139 
and intensity scanning in 37 preeclamptic and 44 control pregnancies. There was no detectable 
140 
association between fetal rs4769613 genotype and trophoblast Flt-1 and sFlt-1 expression in cases 
141 
(P=0.47) or controls (P=0.26). We also compared maternal serum sFlt-1 from the first or third 
142 
trimester  with fetal rs4769613 genotype in mother-baby pairs from 242 control and 276 
143 
preeclamptic pregnancies. Control pregnancies exhibited a trend towards increasing maternal serum 
144 
sFlt-1 levels with each fetal copy of rs4769613[C] in the third trimester, which reached nominal 
145 
significance (P = 0.04), while in case pregnancies the levels were higher (P<0.001) but with no 
146 
detectable difference between genotype groups (P=0.47) (Fig. 2c). We did not have suitable 
147 
placental tissue for mRNA studies, but the Genotype-Tissue expression (GTEx) database 
148 
(www.gtexportal.org) does not provide evidence for rs4769613 or rs12050029 allele-specific 
149 
differences in FLT1 expression in 42 tissues, although data for placental tissue are not recorded. The 
150 
evidence that fetal rs4769613 genotype affects maternal serum levels of sFlt-1 is therefore modest. 
151 
Subtle changes in sFlt-1 concentration driven by fetal FLT1 genotype, as suggested by the data from 
152 
control pregnancies, may be masked in preeclampsia, where the overall levels are already high. Also, 
153 
this effect is minimal compared to the increase in serum sFlt-1 seen in preeclamptic pregnancies so 
154 
it may not reflect the role of the preeclampsia associated variants in the pathophysiology of 
155 
preeclampsia.  
156 
 
157 
We explored whether the preeclampsia associated variants affected other diseases or traits by using 
158 
the deCODE database of common diseases and traits routinely measured at hospitals and clinical 
159 
laboratories (see Methods).  Given that rs4769613 and rs12050029 are not in LD (Supplementary Fig. 
160 
2), it is noteworthy that the only significant database association for both variants was red blood cell 
161 
(RBC) count (P=5.0 x 10-4 and P=1.5 x 10-7 for rs4769613 and rs12050029 respectively), where the 
162 
preeclampsia risk allele  consistently associated with  reduced RBC count (Supplementary Table 6). 
163 
The RBC association with FLT1 is intriguing since its VEGF ligand has previously been implicated in 
164 
regulation of erythropoiesis, but the mode and sites of action are complex10,11. Our preeclampsia 
165 
results suggest that in the fetus the two variants lead to an increase in sFlt-1, while the same alleles 
166 
are associated with reduced RBC count in the general (non-pregnant) population. The effect on both 
167 
preeclampsia and RBC is consistent with the variants acting through the neighbouring FLT1.  
168 
We note that SNP rs4769613 is located between FLT1 and POMP, which encodes proteasome 
169 
maturation protein, a ubiquitously expressed protein involved in proteasome assembly and MHC 
170 
class I antigen presentation12. We cannot exclude the possibility that sequence variants at this locus 
171 
affect expression of POMP or more distant genes, but the GTEx database does not provide any 
172 
evidence to support this contention. 
173 
 
174 
 Evidence presented here implies that altered trophoblastic FLT1 expression is not merely a 
175 
secondary consequence of placental pathology in preeclampsia, but is central to its aetiology. A role 
176 
for fetal sequence variants in susceptibility to preeclampsia is consistent with patterns of inheritance 
177 
implicating both maternal and paternal factors2.  The fetal FLT1 gene has been indirectly implicated 
178 
previously in pregnancies with fetal trisomy 13, which are associated with increased placental 
179 
expression of sFlt-1, and an increased incidence of preeclampsia13. sFlt-1 is a marker of placental 
180 
malfunction, a hallmark of EO-preeclampsia8; our observation that FLT1 genotype is associated even 
181 
more strongly with LO-preeclampsia implies that placental pathology is also a feature of late-onset 
182 
disease. The variants we describe provide tools for experimental testing of whether, how, when and 
183 
where they affect FLT1 expression, and how this relates to the pathophysiology of preeclampsia and 
184 
its subtypes. The discovery of sequence variants in the genome of the fetus that increase the risk of 
185 
disease in the mother is an ultimate demonstration of the closeness of the remarkable symbiosis we 
186 
call pregnancy.

a) Forest plot showing Odds Ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) calculated by the 
317 
EMIM algorithm6  for preeclampsia risk conferred by one or two copies of rs4769613 risk allele C 
318 
carried in the fetus (R1, R2) or carried in the mother (S1, S2).  Individual datasets (GOPEC, MoBa, 
319 
FINNPEC) and meta-analysis across the datasets ([Meta]) show the OR is increased by each fetal 
320 
copy of risk allele C where for R1 P=3.7x10-4 and for R2 P=3.7x10-9.  By contrast, the OR for maternal 
321 
copies (S1, S2) are not significantly different from 1 implying that, after accounting for fetal copies, 
322 
maternal copies of allele C confer no additional increased risk of preeclampsia.    
323 
b) Forest Plot for preeclampsia subtypes defined by early and late onset (EO-PE, LO-PE) and by 
324 
birthweight that is small-for-gestational age (SGA-PE) or not (nonSGA-PE).  Case-case comparisons in 
325 
blue font show risk allele C is more significantly associated with LO-PE and nonSGA-PE than with EO-
326 
PE and SGA-PE. Dividing cases into the four possible subcategories found that allele C confers 
327 
greatest risk to LO+nonSGA cases and least risk to EO+SGA cases.   
328 
c) Box-and-whisker plots of first and third trimester maternal serum sFlt-1 concentration in 
329 
preeclampsia cases and controls, showing the effect of fetal rs4769613 genotype. Boxes span the 
330 
first to the third quartile of sFlt-1 concentration, with horizontal bars within the box denoting the 
331 
median; whiskers extend to the 10th and 90th centiles. Maternal sFlt-1 is higher in cases than controls 
332 
in the third trimester across all fetal genotypes (t-test ln(sFlt-1): t=7.79; 200 d.f.; 2-tailed P< 0.001). 
333 
In third trimester controls, each copy of the rs4769613[C] allele carried by the fetus is associated 
334 
with an increase in maternal sFlt-1 (linear regression of ln(sFlt) with SNP genotype (coded 0, 1 and 2) 
335 
and gestational age as covariates: P=0.04).

Results are ordered by strength of association with preeclampsia in GWAS+Replication meta-analysis at three 
345 
variants near FLT1 not in linkage disequilibrium. Row for rs4769613 is bold because its GWAS+Replication P value is 
346 
genome-wide significant (p<5×10
-8).  rs12050029 and rs149427560 are included in the table because their 
347 
GWAS+Replication P values are below FLT1 region-wide significance threshold (6.01×10

 Methods 
357 
Cohorts 
358 
Three European cohorts of offspring from pregnancies affected by preeclampsia provided cases for 
359 
GWAS meta-analysis: the GOPEC and ALSPAC cohorts from the UK, and the Icelandic deCODE cohort. 
360 
Two independent cohorts were used for replication genotyping: the Finnish FINNPEC collection, and 
361 
the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study (MoBa).  Recruitment criteria were not identical in all 
362 
cohorts, so subsets were selected for this study based on an internationally recognised definition of 
363 
preeclampsia14: new-onset hypertension after the 20th week of gestation, with systolic blood 
364 
pressure ≥140mmHg or diastolic blood pressure ≥90mmHg on at least two occasions; and new-onset 
365 
proteinuria of 0.3g/24 hours or more, or ≥1+ on dipstick analysis of urine. All were singleton 
366 
pregnancies in a white Western European woman; preeclamptic pregnancies in women with a 
367 
previous history of essential hypertension, type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus, ischaemic heart 
368 
disease, cerebrovascular accident or chronic renal disease were excluded. Phenotypic details are 
369 
summarised in Supplementary Tables 7 and 8. 
370 
 
371 
Written informed consent was obtained from participants, or from parents on behalf of minors, and 
372 
all studies were approved by local Research Ethics Committees. 
373 
GOPEC (Genetics of Pre-eclampsia) 
374 
The UK GOPEC collection includes 1157 DNA samples from mother-baby pairs with preeclampsia 
375 
recruited at diagnosis between 1992 and 2009 for genetic studies of preeclampsia15. Control data 
376 
were derived from the WTCCC2 genome-wide analysis of 2930 samples from the 1958 Birth 
377 
Cohort and 2737 samples from the National Blood Services, providing control data for 5297 
378 
individuals after QC16.  
379 
 
380 
ALSPAC (Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children) 
381 
The ALSPAC prospective birth cohort study recruited pregnant women living in the South West of 
382 
England between 1991 and 1992, and has been described elsewhere17. They included 13,678 
383 
singleton pregnancies resulting in a live birth. After exclusion of women with existing hypertension, 
384 
diabetes and gestational diabetes, there were 7382 pregnancies for which blood pressure and 
385 
proteinuria measurements and fetal GWAS data were available. Of these, 146 met the definition of 
386 
preeclampsia and were included. The control group of 6130 subjects was derived from all other 
387 
included pregnancies with fetal GWAS data in women not affected by essential hypertension or 
388 
gestational hypertension.  
389 
  
390 
deCODE Pre-eclampsia cohort 
391 
The deCODE preeclampsia cohort is part of an ongoing sample collection including a large part of the 
392 
Icelandic population. Preeclamptic pregnancies occurring between 1970 and 2009 were identified 
393 
through scrutiny of hospital records at the Landspitali University Hospital, which provides secondary 
394 
and tertiary services for the whole of Iceland. Initially, a group of women with hypertensive disease 
395 
in pregnancy (ICD-9:642.0–9 and ICD-10: O10–16) in the years 1984-1999 were selected for further 
396 
study based on familial relationships. All maternity records for these women were scrutinised and 
397 
each affected pregnancy reclassified18. This identified 491 singleton preeclamptic pregnancies. 
398 
Preeclamptic pregnancies from 2000-2009 were identified based on ICD-10 codes (O14-15), yielding 
399 
1,311 additional singleton preeclamptic pregnancies. Overall information on 1,802 singleton 
400 
 preeclamptic pregnancies of 1,662 mothers is available.  GWAS data was available from 1507 
401 
offspring of these pregnancies, identified retrospectively based on the national register. The control 
402 
group comprises 296,865 individuals from the deCODE sample collection.  
403 
  
404 
MoBa (Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study) 
405 
The Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study is a longitudinal study of over 110,000 pregnant 
406 
women, their children and partners, recruited between 1999 and 2008 from maternity units 
407 
throughout Norway19. 1200 pregnancies affected by preeclampsia were identified from Medical 
408 
Birth Register of Norway records; the validity of the diagnosis has been assessed by retrieval and 
409 
examination of antenatal records. 1200 non-hypertensive pregnancies provided the control group.  
410 
Pregnancies were excluded from case and control groups if a maternal history of essential 
411 
hypertension, chronic renal disease or diabetes mellitus was recorded in the Medical Birth Registry 
412 
of Norway.  
413 
   
414 
FINNPEC (Finnish Genetic of Pre-eclampsia Consortium)  
415 
The FINNPEC collection was assembled in Finland between 2008 and 2011 from two recruitment 
416 
arms20. Samples were collected at the time of diagnosis of preeclampsia from 879 mothers, and 
417 
during pregnancy from 922 non-pre-eclamptic mothers from antenatal and labour wards. Their 
418 
children and partners were also enrolled. A further 525 pregnancies affected by preeclampsia were 
419 
identified by examination of hospital records, and women and offspring were invited to participate 
420 
by letter.  After exclusion of pregnancies which did not meet the entry criteria for this study, 
421 
offspring of 605 preeclamptic pregnancies were included as cases, and offspring of 800 non-
422 
hypertensive pregnancies provided the control group. 
423 
 
424 
Genotyping, quality control, genotype imputation and association analysis in GWAS datasets 
425 
GOPEC  
426 
1157 offspring of preeclamptic pregnancies were assayed on the Illumina OmniExpress chip; 
427 
maternal samples where available were similarly genotyped.  A total of 730,525 variants were called 
428 
with the GenCall algorithm. We carried out QC using PLINK 
429 
(http://pngu.mgh.harvard.edu/~purcell/anal.shtml) and SMARTPCA21. A subset of the samples (186) 
430 
were whole genome amplified (WGA). WGA genotype calls can be prone to calling artefacts.  To 
431 
address this we removed variants with either low call rate (95%) or Mendelian errors in the WGA 
432 
samples and we then performed a pseudo-case control analysis of WGA vs. non-WGA and removed 
433 
variants with significant genotypic association (P<0.001). We then applied standard QC to the 
434 
combined WGA and non-WGA dataset on this reduced set of variants (670,435).  Briefly, standard 
435 
QC comprises the following subject level exclusion criteria: individual call-rate < 95%; heterozygosity 
436 
>3 s.d. from the mean; any of the first 3 HapMap (based on CEU, YRI, CHB, JPT and GIH) principal 
437 
axes of variation >4 s.d. from the mean and gender mismatch.  Related individuals (IBD>0.1) with 
438 
lowest call-rate were preferentially removed. The variant level exclusion criteria are: call-rate <95%, 
439 
exact Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium P<1 x 10-6, minor allele frequency (MAF) <1% and non-random 
440 
missingness of uncalled genotypes ("plink --test-mishap”) with Bonferroni corrected P<0.05.  These 
441 
filters left 1005 samples (89 WGA) and 574,919 variants.  
442 
 
443 
 We used WTCCC2 population controls from the National Blood Donors Cohort and UK 1958 Birth 
444 
Cohort16. These samples were genotyped on the Illumina 1.2M chip and called using GenCall.   
445 
Strand ambiguous markers were removed and the standard QC described above was then applied to 
446 
the two control datasets. The merged control datasets consisted of 5,297 samples and 438,912 
447 
variants. This control dataset was merged with the case dataset resulting in 429,754 post QC variants 
448 
that were genotyped in both cases and controls. 
449 
 
450 
Cases and controls were imputed together with IMPUTE2 (impute_v2.3.0)22 and SHAPEIT23 using the 
451 
pre-phasing workflow against the 1000 Genomes Phase 1 reference panel (Dec. 2013) downloaded 
452 
from the IMPUTE2 website. Imputation resulted in 10,404,388 bi-allelic variants with MAF > 0.25% 
453 
that were either directly genotyped or imputed with IMPUTE2 INFO score >0.6.  
454 
 
455 
Post imputation association analysis was carried out using SNPTEST (v2.4.1)22 with the "expected" 
456 
method with no ancestry principal components.  We calculated the genomic control on variants with 
457 
MAF>0.5% as λGC =1.005. 
458 
 
459 
deCODE  
460 
Details of GWAS genotyping, QC and imputation of the Icelandic dataset including the preeclampsia 
461 
cases and controls used in this study have been described24. Briefly, samples were assayed with the 
462 
Illumina HumanHap300, HumanCNV370, HumanHap610, HumanHap1M, HumanHap660, Omni-1, 
463 
Omni 2.5 or Omni Express bead chips at deCODE genetics. Following QC a final set of 676,913 
464 
autosomal SNPs were used for long range phasing of all chip-genotyped samples. Making use of the 
465 
Icelandic genealogy untyped first and second degree relatives of chip-typed individuals were also 
466 
included in the analysis to increase power24. In total 104,220 chip-typed individuals and 294,212 of 
467 
their untyped relatives were imputed based on a panel of sequence variants identified through 
468 
whole genome sequencing of 2,636 Icelanders to a mean depth of 20x. 
469 
 
470 
GWAS analysis of Icelandic preeclampsia offspring included a total of 1,507 cases (380 chip typed) 
471 
and 296,865 controls (91,326 chip-typed). The controls used in this study were Icelandic individuals 
472 
from other ongoing GWAS studies at deCODE and their relatives. Logistic regression was used to test 
473 
for association between sequence variants and disease, treating disease status as the response and 
474 
genotype counts as covariates. Other characteristics also included in the model as nuisance variables 
475 
were: sex, county of birth, current age or age at death (first and second order terms included), 
476 
genotyping status and an indicator function for the overlap of the lifetime of the individual with the 
477 
timespan of phenotype collection25. In order to account for relatedness and stratification within the 
478 
case and control sample sets we applied the method of genomic control25. Based on a set of about 
479 
300,000 common variants distributed across the genome the inflation in the chi-squared statistic for 
480 
preeclampsia offspring was estimated to be 1.115. 
481 
 
482 
ALSPAC 
483 
A total of 9,912 ALSPAC children were genotyped using the Illumina HumanHap550 quad genome-
484 
wide SNP genotyping platform (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) by Logistics and Genotyping 
485 
Facilities at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute and Laboratory Corporation of America (LabCorp 
486 
Holdings., Burlington, NC, USA). PLINK software (v1.07) was used to carry out quality control 
487 
measures. Individuals were excluded from further analysis on the basis of having incorrect gender 
488 
 assignments, minimal or excessive heterozygosity (< 0.320 and > 0.345 for the Sanger data and < 
489 
0.310 and > 0.330 for the LabCorp data), disproportionate levels of individual missingness (> 3%) and 
490 
being of non-European ancestry (as detected by a multidimensional scaling analysis seeded with 
491 
HapMap 2 individuals). EIGENSTRAT analysis revealed no additional obvious population stratification 
492 
and genome-wide analyses with other phenotypes in the same cohort indicate a low lambda. SNPs 
493 
with a minor allele frequency of < 1% and call rate of < 95% were removed. Furthermore, only SNPs 
494 
that passed an exact test of Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (P > 5×10-7) were considered for analysis. 
495 
Related subjects (> 10% IBD) that passed all other quality control thresholds were retained during 
496 
subsequent phasing and imputation. 9,115 subjects and 500,527 SNPs passed these quality control 
497 
filters.  
498 
We combined 477,482 SNP genotypes in common between the sample of children and mothers. 
499 
Genotyping and QC of the ALSPAC mothers can be found elsewhere26. SNPs with genotype 
500 
missingness > 1% and those that failed the exact test of HWE were removed. A further 321 
501 
participants were removed due to potential ID mismatches (IBD < 1). The resultant dataset 
502 
comprised 17,842 subjects of which 6,305 were mother-offspring pairs. An additional 112 SNPs were 
503 
removed after a liftover of the merged genotyped data from Hg 18 to Hg19. Haplotype phasing was 
504 
performed using SHAPEIT (v2.r644)23 and known autosomal variants were imputed with IMPUTE 
505 
V2.2.222 using the 1000 genomes reference panel (Phase 1, Version 3) consisting of 2186 reference 
506 
haplotypes (including non-Europeans).  
507 
 
508 
Logistic regression, as implemented in SNPTEST v2.5-beta422, was used to test for association 
509 
between imputed genotype probabilities and disease status. Based on a set of ~9 million SNPs 
510 
(MAF>0.5% and IMPUTE2 INFO>0.6), no evidence of genomic inflation was observed (λGC =1.008).  
511 
 
512 
Follow-up genotyping  
513 
Follow-up variants in the FLT1 locus were chosen to test association with the rs4769613 peak and to 
514 
test possible association in the other 8 FLT1 LD blocks shown in Supplementary Fig. 2.  Some 
515 
genotyped variants were highly correlated surrogates of rs4769613 or of other follow-up SNPs in 
516 
case the assay for the primary variant failed, and to ensure that assertion of a true-positive 
517 
association did not rely on genotyping of a single variant.  Follow-up variants in non-FLT1 regions of 
518 
the genome were chosen based on GWAS meta-analysis P value and were selected to further test 
519 
suggestive evidence of association exhibited by the top GWAS discovery meta-analysis signals.  
520 
Replication genotyping was performed at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute using Sequenom iPLEX 
521 
assays, and at the British Heart Foundation Glasgow Cardiovascular Research Centre using TaqMan 
522 
Open Array genotyping. Variants were excluded from analysis if they had call rates < 95%; subjects 
523 
with call rates < 80%, and families in the MoBa cohort that exhibited more than 1 Mendelian error 
524 
were also excluded. For four variants (rs7305125, rs149427560, rs12050029 and rs4769628) follow-
525 
up data for the MoBa samples was in silico data based on 1046 cases and 961 controls assayed on 
526 
the Illumina HumanCoreExome-12 v1.1 chip and imputed based on the 1000 Genomes Phase 3 
527 
reference panel. Of those, 908 cases and 909 controls were also included in the directly genotyped 
528 
MoBa replication set. 
529 
 
530 
Meta-analysis   
531 
 Prior to meta-analysis GWAS results were adjusted by a genomic control λGC factor where 
532 
appropriate as described above for each GWAS cohort. Study level variants with a MAF<0.5% or an 
533 
imputation quality score <0.6 were excluded from the analysis. This left 7,476,169 autosomal 
534 
variants for analysis. The GWAS and the GWAS+Replication meta-analyses were conducted using the 
535 
fixed effect inverse variance weighting method implemented in MetaSoft27. No genomic control 
536 
adjustment was applied to the GWAS meta-analysis results since the inflation factor was negligible 
537 
(λGC =1.0075).  
538 
Conditional and FLT1 region-wide analyses 
539 
The association between disease status on a variant conditional on rs4769613 was assessed by 
540 
inverse variance weighted meta-analysis of the per cohort conditional analyses. Individual cohorts 
541 
were analysed by logistic regression of the disease status against expected genotype dose with the 
542 
expected doses of conditioning variants included as covariates. This approach was implemented for 
543 
each cohort as follows: MoBa and FINNPEC replication cohorts were analysed using “plink --
544 
condition”; GOPEC and MoBa GWAS were analysed using “snptest  -condition_on”; the deCODE 
545 
association analysis is described above; ALSPAC conditional associations were inferred from the 
546 
summary association statistics with the use of the 1000 Genomes Phase 3 EUR samples  to estimate 
547 
the LD structure using the joint analysis method28.  We assessed the region-wide effective number of 
548 
tests using the method of Gao29 on the imputed WTCCC2 UK control dataset for the 5405 common 
549 
variants (MAF>5%) within 1Mb of rs4769613, yielding a total of 832 independent tests and hence a 
550 
FLT1 region-wide significance threshold of 0.05/832=6.01×10-5. 
551 
Maternal, fetal and parent-of-origin effect analysis 
552 
The family genotype data was jointly analysed using the EMIM method6.The subjects were first 
553 
partitioned into maximal family groups within each cohort (Supplementary Table 9). We then fitted 
554 
EMIM models assuming Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and Exchangeable Parental Genotypes. We 
555 
considered two parameter sets: maternal and fetal effects (R1, R2, S1 and S2) and maternal, fetal and 
556 
parent of origin effect (R1, R2, S1, S2 and Im) where Im is the odds-ratio associated with the maternal 
557 
transmission of the risk allele. The per cohort results were combined using inverse variance 
558 
weighted meta-analysis. 
559 
Preeclampsia subtype analysis 
560 
To analyse the relation between rs4769613 and preeclampsia subtypes we pooled genotype and 
561 
clinical data of the GOPEC, FINNPEC and MoBa cohorts (Supplementary Table 8). The phenotype 
562 
associations were calculated using logistic regression with cohort and FINNPEC recruitment region 
563 
included as indicator variables.  
564 
deCODE phenotype database 
565 
The deCODE Genetics phenotype database contains medical information on diseases and traits 
566 
obtained through collaboration with specialists in each field. This includes information on 
567 
cardiovascular diseases (myocardial infarction, coronary arterial disease, peripheral arterial disease, 
568 
atrial fibrillation, sick sinus syndrome and stroke), metabolic disorders (obesity, diabetes, and 
569 
metabolic syndrome), psychiatric disorders (schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, anxiety and depression), 
570 
addictions (nicotine, alcohol), inflammatory diseases (rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, and asthma), 
571 
musculoskeletal disorders (osteoarthritis, osteoporosis), eye diseases (glaucoma), kidney diseases 
572 
(kidney stones, kidney failure) and 29 types of cancer. Anthropometric measures have also been 
573 
 collected through several of these projects. Routinely measured traits from patient workups 
574 
(sodium, potassium, bicarbonate, calcium, phosphate, creatinine, blood cell counts, haemoglobin, 
575 
haematocrit, 15 immunoglobulins, iron, vitamins, lipids, liver function tests and more) were obtained 
576 
from the Landspitali University Hospital, Reykjavík, and the Icelandic Medical Center Laboratory in 
577 
Mjodd (Laeknasetrid), Reykjavik. The number of independent and uncorrelated secondary traits 
578 
tested for association amounts to 400. 
579 
 
580 
Placental expression of Flt1 and sFlt1 
581 
Women with singleton pregnancies delivering by caesarean section were recruited to the Pre-
582 
eclampsia Study between 2002 and 2012 at St. Olavs Hospital, Trondheim University Hospital and 
583 
Haukeland University Hospital, Bergen. Healthy and pre-eclamptic pregnancies were included as 
584 
described previously30. A tangential section (100 mg) from the maternal central side of the placenta 
585 
was collected directly after delivery, fixed in 10% neutral-buffered formalin and paraffin embedded. 
586 
Tissue sections of 3 μm were pre-treated in Target Retrieval Solution (#K8004, Dako) and stained by 
587 
Flt-1 antibody (1:175, # ab32152, Abcam) using EnVision (#K4011, Dako) according to the 
588 
manufacturer’s protocol. This Flt-1 antibody recognises membrane-bound Flt-1 and splice isoforms 
589 
sFlt-1, sFlt1-14, and isoform 4 (61 kDa). Staining was performed using Autostainer Plus (#S3800, 
590 
Dako) and images taken at two sites per placenta with an Eclipse E400 microscope and DS-Fi1 
591 
camera. Staining intensity in syncytiotrophoblast was analysed by NIS-Elements BR 4.0 software 
592 
(Nikon), excluding immature villi, and blinded for pregnancy outcomes. Staining intensity data were 
593 
analysed separately in a general linear model incorporating SNP genotype, gestational age and 
594 
hospital of origin as cofactors.  
595 
 
596 
Maternal serum sFlt1 and fetal genotype 
597 
We identified mother-baby pairs from the FINNPEC collection for whom offspring DNA and maternal 
598 
serum samples from the first and/or third trimester of pregnancy were available for analysis. 
599 
Maternal serum sFlt-1 concentration was measured using electrochemiluminescence immunoassays 
600 
(ECLIA; Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany) on a Cobas e 601 analyzer (Hitachi High 
601 
Technology Co, Tokyo, Japan). Offspring genotype at rs4769613 was determined by Sequenom 
602 
MassArray iPLEX genotyping in the FiMM Technology Centre (University of Helsinki, Finland). 
603 
Investigators were blinded for pregnancy outcome during sample analysis. Serum sFlt-1 data were 
604 
normalized by logarithmic transformation. Case and control data were compared by unpaired t-
605 
testing; genotypic associations with serum sFlt-1 were examined separately in cases and controls in a 
606 
linear model, with SNP genotype and gestational age as covariates.  
607 
 
608

All results are from unconditional logistic regression and are listed by NCBI Build 37 variant position on chromosome 13 (“Chr13 
Position”).  “N”, total cases / controls in meta-analysis;  “Risk/Alt Allele”, allele with higher frequency in GWAS cases than controls and 
alternate allele; “RAF”, risk allele frequency in UK GWAS controls;  “OR” and “95% CI”, allelic odds ratio and 95% confidence interval.  
Rows for rs4769613 and its near-perfect surrogate rs7328374 are in bold to highlight genome-wide significance (P<5×10-8) of their 
GWAS+Replication P values. Genotypes of rs149427560 for the FINNPEC replication cohort were proxied from rs11619261 (pairwise 
r2=0.88 in Finland 1000Genomes phase 3); results for several variants do not include FINNPEC data (rs17555115, rs3829387, 
rs2096035, rs2296284 and rs9319429) because they were not genotyped in FINNPEC.  Most of these variants were not genotyped since 
they are in strong LD and redundant with other variants genotyped in FINNPEC.

All MoBa trios with genotyped DNA from both parents and child are included. 
“C” and “T” show total counts of risk allele C and alternate allele T transmitted from each heterozygous 
(C/T) parent to an offspring.  “%C” is percentage of risk allele C among total transmitted alleles and 
shows preferential inheritance of allele C (53.6%) by preeclampsia offspring but nearly equal inheritance 
(50.7%) by offspring in control families; TDT 2=(C-T)2/(C+T)  derived in Spielman et al (American 
Journal of Human Genetics 52:506-516, 1993) shows statistical significance (p<0.045) of preferential 
allele C inheritance by preeclampsia cases but non-significance (p=0.704) in control trios.

“C” and “T” show total counts of risk allele C and alternate allele T transmitted from each heterozygous 
(C/T) parent to an offspring.  “%C” is percentage of allele C among total transmitted alleles. 
Preeclampsia trios are included only if maternal and paternal allele transmissions are unambiguous (i.e. 
preeclampsia trios were excluded if both parents and offspring were heterozygous).  “2” is 2x2 Pearson 
χ2 Test on counts of allele C and T transmitted from heterozygous mothers versus fathers in 
unambiguous preeclampsia trios.

 Supplementary Table 8 | Early and late onset cases of pre-eclampsia 
 
 
 
 
Number of cases of early onset and late onset preeclampsia used in data analysis. Only cases where gestational age at diagnosis of 
pre-eclampsia was unequivocally recorded were included in sub-group analysis.  
“EO-preeclampsia” is early onset pre-eclampsia, diagnosed at <34 weeks gestation. “LO-preeclampsia” is late onset pre-eclampsia, 
diagnosed at ≥34 weeks gestation.

Supplementary Figure 1 
  
 
Forest plots for GWAS and replication cohorts at independent variants near FLT1 giving evidence for 
association with preeclampsia. 
Forests plots are presented in order of strength of association with preeclampsia (PE) (see Table 1).  The top 
line of each plot gives variant rs number, position on chromosome 13 (human genome build 19), risk allele (i.e.
allele with higher frequency in cases than controls in the GWAS meta-analysis)and its population frequency in 
parenthesis, other allele, and Phet giving the P value for heterogeneity of odd ratios (OR) in the five cohorts.
Subsequent lines provide a breakdown of results for each GWAS and replication cohort including number of
cases and controls, the allelic case-control OR and its 95% confidence interval (95% CI) and case-control 
association P value.   [META] indicates corresponding meta-analysis results for GWAS cohorts, replication 
cohorts, or GWAS and replication cohorts combined; each meta-analysis allelic OR is represented by a 
“diamond” whose width corresponds to the 95% CI. The first three Forest plots give unconditional logistic
regression results and the last three plots give logistic regression results that condition out the effect of
rs4769613.  The SNP rs11619261 is included here because it is used as a proxy for rs149427560 in the
FINNPEC cohort (see Table 1). 
  
 
Supplementary Figure 2 
Linkage disequilibrium (LD) matrix showing pairwise LD r2 values among all variants near FLT1
selected for follow-up in Replication cohorts. 
LD r2 values were generated by LDlink software (http://analysistools.nci.nih.gov/LDlink) from 1000Genomes 
Phase 3 genotypes for all European populations.  Variants are ordered by chromosomal position and shown in
  
 
relation to FLT1 and POMP.  Intensity of red shading (see colour legend) shows approximate r2 value for each 
variant pair and implies that the 21 follow-up variants define 9 LD “blocks” with high pairwise r2 within each 
block but low pairwise r2 for members of different blocks.   
  
 
Supplementary Figure 3 
rs12050029: Preeclampsia subtype meta-analysis overview. 
Forest plot for preeclampsia (PE) subtypes defined by early and late onset (EO-PE, LO-PE) and by birthweight 
that is small-for-gestational age (SGA-PE) or not (nonSGA-PE).  Case-control comparison shows risk allele G 
is significantly associated with LO-PE (P=1.4x10-5), nonSGA-PE (P=4.5x10-4) and SGA-PE (P=6.6x10-3). The 
strength of association does not differ between SGA-PE and nonSGA-PE.
