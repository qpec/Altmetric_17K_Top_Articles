Abstract
Background
There is uncertainty about the influence of diet during pregnancy and infancy on a child’s
immune development. We assessed whether variations in maternal or infant diet can influ-
ence risk of allergic or autoimmune disease.
Methods and findings
Two authors selected studies, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. Grading of Recom-
mendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) was used to assess cer-
tainty of findings. We searched Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online
(MEDLINE), Excerpta Medica dataBASE (EMBASE), Web of Science, Central Register of
Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and Literatura Latino Americana em Ciências da Sau
´de
(LILACS) between January 1946 and July 2013 for observational studies and until Decem-
ber 2017 for intervention studies that evaluated the relationship between diet during preg-
nancy, lactation, or the first year of life and future risk of allergic or autoimmune disease. We
identified 260 original studies (964,143 participants) of milk feeding, including 1 intervention
trial of breastfeeding promotion, and 173 original studies (542,672 participants) of other
maternal or infant dietary exposures, including 80 trials of maternal (n = 26), infant (n = 32),
or combined (n = 22) interventions. Risk of bias was high in 125 (48%) milk feeding studies
and 44 (25%) studies of other dietary exposures. Evidence from 19 intervention trials sug-
gests that oral supplementation with nonpathogenic micro-organisms (probiotics) during
late pregnancy and lactation may reduce risk of eczema (Risk Ratio [RR] 0.78; 95% CI
0.68–0.90; I2 = 61%; Absolute Risk Reduction 44 cases per 1,000; 95% CI 20–64), and 6

Funding: This work was funded by the Food
Standards Agency grant FS305005 to RJB, VGL
and JLB https://www.food.gov.uk/science/
research/allergy-research/fs305005. The Food
Standards Agency commissioned this work,
commissioned external peer review of the study
protocol, statistical methods and study report, and
 trials suggest that fish oil supplementation during pregnancy and lactation may reduce risk
of allergic sensitisation to egg (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.53–0.90; I2 = 15%; Absolute Risk Reduc-
tion 31 cases per 1,000; 95% CI 10–47). GRADE certainty of these findings was moderate.
We found weaker support for the hypotheses that breastfeeding promotion reduces risk of
eczema during infancy (1 intervention trial), that longer exclusive breastfeeding is associ-
ated with reduced type 1 diabetes mellitus (28 observational studies), and that probiotics
reduce risk of allergic sensitisation to cow’s milk (9 intervention trials), where GRADE cer-
tainty of findings was low. We did not find that other dietary exposures—including prebiotic
supplements, maternal allergenic food avoidance, and vitamin, mineral, fruit, and vegetable
intake—influence risk of allergic or autoimmune disease. For many dietary exposures, data
were inconclusive or inconsistent, such that we were unable to exclude the possibility of
important beneficial or harmful effects. In this comprehensive systematic review, we were
not able to include more recent observational studies or verify data via direct contact with
authors, and we did not evaluate measures of food diversity during infancy.
Conclusions
Our findings support a relationship between maternal diet and risk of immune-mediated dis-
eases in the child. Maternal probiotic and fish oil supplementation may reduce risk of
eczema and allergic sensitisation to food, respectively.
Author summary
Why was this study done?
• There is uncertainty about the effects of specific dietary variations in early life on risk of
immune-mediated disease.
What did the researchers do and find?
• We undertook a systematic review of observational and intervention studies of maternal
diet during pregnancy and lactation and infant diet during the first year of life to evaluate
whether dietary exposures in early life influence risk of allergic or autoimmune disease.
• We found that supplementation with micro-organisms (probiotics) during late preg-
nancy and breastfeeding may reduce risk of eczema, and fish oil supplementation during
pregnancy and breastfeeding may reduce risk of sensitisation to food allergens.
• We found more limited data that longer duration of breastfeeding may reduce risk of
eczema and type 1 diabetes mellitus.
What do these findings mean?
• A mother’s diet during pregnancy and lactation may influence her child’s risk of devel-
oping allergic disease.

 Introduction
Immune-mediated health conditions such as allergic and autoimmune diseases appear to
have increased in prevalence in many countries and are leading causes of chronic illness in
young people [1]. There is evidence that early dietary exposures may influence the develop-
ment of these diseases, but a comprehensive analysis of the relationship between all dietary
exposures during pregnancy, lactation, or the first year of life and risk of allergic or autoim-
mune disease has not been undertaken [1]. Relevant dietary exposures may include intake
of individual foods or food groups, nutrients or nutrient groups, dietary supplements,
avoidance of specific allergenic foods, timing of introduction of specific foods or food
groups to the infant diet, overall dietary pattern, and duration of breastfeeding. A recent
World Allergy Organization guideline recommended probiotic and prebiotic supplements
for eczema prevention [2,3], but European, North American, and Australasian guidelines
do not support this [4–6]. Several guidelines recommend exclusive breastfeeding for at least
4 to 6 months to reduce risk of eczema, food allergy, and wheezing [4,5,7], and a recent Aus-
tralasian guideline recommends oily fish or omega-3 fatty acid supplements during preg-
nancy to reduce eczema [6]. Recent focused systematic reviews support a relationship
between breastfeeding and reduced asthma risk [8,9] and between probiotics and prebiotics
and reduced eczema risk [2,10,11]. In order to inform United Kingdom dietary recommen-
dations for infants and their pregnant or lactating mothers, we undertook an updated and
comprehensive systematic review of diet during pregnancy and infancy and risk of allergic
sensitisation, allergic disease, or autoimmune disease.
Methods
This review is reported in accordance with PRISMA guidance. The review is part of a series of
systematic reviews commissioned by the UK Food Standards Agency in order to inform UK
dietary recommendations for infants and their pregnant or lactating mothers, under the title
‘Review of scientific published literature on infant feeding and development of atopic and
autoimmune disease’. The protocols for the systematic reviews were registered with the Inter-
national Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO CRD42013003802 ‘Review
A:milk feeding’; CRD42013004239 ‘Review B:timing of allergenic food introduction’;
CRD42013004252 ‘Review C:maternal and infant diet’) on 5 August 2013, prior to title screen-
ing or selecting any studies from the search results. This manuscript reports findings from the
majority of the project, comprising Reviews A and C, ‘milk feeding’ and ‘maternal and infant
diet’. Review B, regarding timing of introduction of allergenic foods, and one part of Review C,
regarding use of hydrolysed infant formula, have been published separately [12,13]. Thus, this
manuscript describes outcomes for maternal or infant intake of individual foods or food
groups, nutrients or nutrient groups, dietary supplements, maternal allergenic food avoidance,
timing of introduction of solid foods or nonallergenic foods to the infant diet, overall dietary
pattern and duration of breastfeeding. This manuscript does not include timing of introduc-
tion of allergenic foods (milk, soya, egg, peanuts, tree nuts, fish, seafood, wheat) to the infant
diet or use of hydrolysed formula in infants. Measures of dietary diversity and objective mea-
sures of nutritional status (with the exception of blood vitamin D level) were not included in
these systematic reviews. These measures were considered to be too indirect as indicators of
dietary intake to be used to inform public health guidance in the UK. As part of this project,
we also searched for other systematic reviews covering the same topic published since 1 Janu-
ary 2011.

 Study interventions and comparators
Studies of total breastfeeding duration, exclusive breastfeeding duration [14], and timing of
solid food introduction were included in Review A ‘milk feeding’. Studies of any other nutri-
tional exposure, ranging from dietary pattern to specific micronutrient supplementation and
from single to multifaceted interventions, were included in Review C ‘maternal and infant
diet’. For observational studies, data on dietary exposures were acquired from interviews,
health records, diaries, and questionnaires. With the exception of blood vitamin D level, we
did not include assessments of nutrient status as an exposure, and we did not include measures
of dietary diversity as an exposure.
Study designs and populations
We included all intervention trials, and observational studies described as cohort, case control
or cross-sectional analytic studies. Intervention trials were classified as randomised controlled
trials (RCTs), where the method of treatment allocation was random, and as controlled clinical
trials (CCTs), where treatment allocation was nonrandom and likely to lead to significant
imbalance between treatment groups. CCTs were analysed separately from RCTs. Prospective
and retrospective observational studies were analysed separately. We included studies of diet
during pregnancy or lactation and of infant feeding between birth and 12 months of age. We
excluded studies in which participants or their mothers were defined by the presence of a pre-
existing disease state, including very low birth weight or very premature infants.
Study outcomes
Allergic and autoimmune outcomes were selected on the basis of their population prevalence in
children and young adults [15]. We included diseases with a prevalence of at least 1 in 1,000 in
children/adolescents or young adults (aged <40 years) but did not include rarer diseases. We did
not include pernicious anaemia or adult-onset rheumatoid arthritis despite a high prevalence in
middle-aged and elderly people because their prevalence in young people is lower than 1 in
1,000, and prospective studies of infant feeding in relation to diseases of older adults were thought
unlikely to have been reported. Allergic outcomes that met our inclusion criteria were asthma or
wheeze, eczema, allergic rhinitis and/or conjunctivitis, food allergy (defined by food challenge,
medical diagnosis, or self/parent report), allergic sensitisation, i.e., skin prick or specific immuno-
globulin E (sIgE) assessment, and total immunoglobin E (IgE) level. We categorised asthma as
wheeze, recurrent wheeze, or atopic wheeze depending on the definition used in the original pub-
lication, and we included measures of lung function, specifically bronchial hyper-reactivity,
forced vital capacity, peak expiratory flow rate, and forced expiratory volume in 1 second. Physi-
cian-diagnosed asthma was included within the category ‘recurrent wheeze’, unless defined as a
single episode of wheeze. Autoimmune diseases that met our inclusion criteria were type 1 diabe-
tes mellitus (TIDM) (doctor diagnosed or serological diagnosis), coeliac disease defined serologi-
cally or clinically (positive Immunoglobulin A tissue Transglutaminase antibodies on one or
more visits or a positive small bowel biopsy), inflammatory bowel disease, autoimmune thyroid
disease, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, vitiligo, and psoriasis, all as doctor diagnosis. For clinical
allergic outcomes, we grouped age at assessment as 0–4 years, 5–14 years, and �15 years. Allergic
sensitisation and autoimmune diseases were not stratified by age at outcome assessment.

 July 2013), Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online (MEDLINE) (1946 to July
2013), and Web of Science (1970 to July 2013) on 25 July 2013. We reran the searches for inter-
vention trials and systematic reviews on 26 February 2017 and for intervention trials again on
15 December 2017. We included all studies published up to that date and studies in progress
or completed but unpublished studies identified through http://apps.who.int/trialsearch/. Both
peer-reviewed publications and abstract publications were included. We reviewed the bibliog-
raphy of eligible studies for possible additional publications and included all eligible publica-
tions, regardless of the language. Study authors were not contacted for original data. The
search strategies were extensively piloted and refined to optimise sensitivity, comparing search
results with those of other systematic reviews. The search strategies are shown in S1 Text.
Study selection
Title and abstract screening was undertaken by a team of 9 trained researchers (RJB, VGL, DI,
NG, KJ, JC, ZR, AR, PD). Two researchers undertook title screening independently and met to
agree upon included and excluded titles. Their screening was checked by a third person, and
uncertainties were resolved at a weekly team meeting between February and April 2014, 2015,
and 2017 (RB, SC, VGL). The full texts of all potentially eligible studies were reviewed.
Risk of bias assessment
Risk of bias assessment was undertaken in duplicate, using modified versions of the Cochrane
Collaboration Risk of Bias tool for intervention trials and the National Institute for Clinical
Excellence methodological checklist for cohort and case–control studies [16]. Risk of bias
domains for intervention trials were Selection bias (sequence generation and allocation con-
cealment), Assessment bias (blinding of outcome assessors and validity of the outcome assess-
ment tool), and Attrition bias (considered high when <70% of randomised participants had
outcome data). Risk of bias domains for observational studies were Selection bias (low if cases
and controls came from similar populations and participation rate �80%), Assessment bias
(the validity of exposure and outcome assessment tools), and Confounding bias (whether
study design and analysis accounted for most potential confounders). We separately included
an assessment of Conflict of Interest for each study, judged as low where there was no evidence
of industry involvement in study design, analysis, interpretation, or publication and no evi-
dence that study authors received remuneration from relevant industry partners for other
activities.
Data extraction
Data extraction was undertaken in duplicate. Disagreements and uncertainties about data cod-
ing and risk of bias were discussed within the team. For foreign language studies, data were
extracted by VGL together with a native speaker of the relevant language (see Acknowl-
edgemnts section). We extracted all relevant data from included studies, including data not
able to be meta-analysed. Data were extracted using either raw frequencies or crude or
adjusted effect estimates. Random effects meta-analysis was undertaken, and where this was
not possible, study results were summarised in a narrative table.
Data selection for analysis
For intervention trials, we extracted outcome data that adhered to the intention-to-treat prin-
ciple in preference to data based on per protocol analyses. Where studies included multiple
intervention groups, we performed pairwise comparisons where we split the number of events

 and no events in the unexposed/control group to prevent double counting. Where studies
reported data at multiple timepoints, we extracted the most complete dataset available beyond
the intervention period (i.e., from 1 year of age onwards); this is the dataset with the largest
denominator or, where the denominator is identical for multiple time points, the largest
numerator (number of events). Where studies reported multiple assessments of the same out-
come at the same timepoint, clinical assessments were selected in preference to serological
assessments, and skin prick in preference to sIgE assessment of allergic sensitisation. For
observational studies of breastfeeding or timing of solid or other food introduction to the
infant diet, data were only included in meta-analysis where the reference group was complete,
i.e., ‘less than’ a certain duration or, in some cases, ‘never’. Where more than one exposure
group was compared with the reference group, we analysed data for the latest exposure group.
For all observational studies, adjusted effect estimates were used in preference to unadjusted
estimates for meta-analysis if both were reported.
Data synthesis
Pooled results for binary outcomes were presented as Risk Ratio (RR) calculated using the
Mantel–Haenszel method, with continuity correction of 0.5 for zero cell frequencies, and odds
ratios (ORs) were pooled using the generic inverse variance method using R (version 3.1.0
2014-04-10, www.r-project.org). For continuous outcomes measured using similar scales, data
were summarised as mean differences with 95% CI. Key findings are presented in a Summary
of Findings table with Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evalua-
tion (GRADE) assessment of certainty of findings [17]. Heterogeneity was quantified using I2
and classified as low (I2 < 25%), moderate (I2 25%–50%), high (I2 50%–75%) or extreme (I2 >
75%). Data were not pooled where I2 � 80%. We assessed for publication bias using Funnel
plots and Egger asymmetry tests where there were � 10 studies in a meta-analysis. We under-
took a priori defined subgroup analyses for meta-analyses with > 5 studies according to overall
risk of bias; disease risk; study design; conflict of interest; for some analyses, by features of the
intervention or exposure assessment; and method of outcome assessment. Data that could not
be included in meta-analysis were reported narratively, and the outcomes of both meta-analy-
ses and narrative reports were considered when interpreting data and making conclusions.
Trial sequential analysis (TSA) was used to quantify the statistical reliability of moderate or
high certainty findings using 2-sided 5% significance and 80% power to estimate optimum het-
erogeneity-adjusted information sizes needed to identify relative risk reductions of 20% and
30%. Control event rates were estimated using random effects meta-analyses of the pooled pro-
portions from the largest studies included in the meta-analysis and compared with event rates
from large population-based studies. TSA quantifies the statistical reliability of data in a cumu-
lative meta-analysis in a similar way to an interim analysis in a single randomised clinical trial.
Results
Our original search identified 16,289 original titles. Title, abstract, and full text screening
yielded a total of 343 titles (260 original studies; 964,143 participants) of milk feeding and 281
titles (173 original studies; 542,672 participants) of maternal and infant diet, including 80 trials
of maternal (n = 26), infant (n = 32), or combined (n = 22) interventions. Full details of the
search results are shown in Fig 1 (PRISMA flow chart), and characteristics of included studies
and risk of bias are summarised in S1 Appendix. Risk of bias was high in 125 (48%) studies of
milk feeding and 44 (25%) studies of maternal and infant diet (most commonly due to attrition
bias in intervention studies and confounding bias in observational studies). Key findings are
shown in Table 1, which includes a GRADE assessment of certainty for each finding [18], and

Breastfeeding duration and timing of solid food introduction
One intervention trial (17,046 participants) and 259 observational studies (947,097 partici-
pants) reported the association between total breastfeeding, exclusive breastfeeding or timing
of solid food introduction, and allergic or autoimmune diseases. The intervention trial found
reduced eczema in the first year of life in centres allocated to deliver a breastfeeding promotion
intervention. Meta-analyses of 24 observational studies showed an association between total
breastfeeding duration and reduced recurrent wheeze at 5 to 14 years (e.g., Fig 2), but we also
found evidence of publication bias. Meta-analyses of 31 observational studies showed an asso-
ciation between total and exclusive breastfeeding duration and reduced TIDM (e.g. Fig 3).
Associations were statistically significant for retrospective studies but not for prospective stud-
ies. The GRADE certainty of these breastfeeding findings was low to very low. There was no
association found for other allergic outcomes or for the other autoimmune diseases studied
(coeliac disease, 12 studies; inflammatory bowel disease, 13 studies; juvenile rheumatoid
arthritis, 3 studies; autoimmune thyroid disease, 1 study).
Intervention trials of other maternal or infant dietary exposures
Probiotic and prebiotic supplementation.
Twenty-eight intervention trials (6,705 partic-
ipants) evaluated probiotic supplements. These were either single or multiple organisms, given
as capsules, powder, or part of a drink or infant formula milk, at a dose of 1 to 10 billion

 colony-forming units per day. Meta-analysis showed an association between probiotic supple-
mentation and reduced eczema (Fig 4; 19 studies; RR 0.78; 95% CI 0.68–0.90; I2 = 61%) or
‘atopic’ eczema (Fig 4; 11 studies; RR 0.78; 95% CI 0.65–0.92; I2 = 0%) at age � 4 years and
reduced allergic sensitisation to cow’s milk at age 1 to 2 years (Fig 5; 97 studies). No significant
association was seen with eczema at age 5 to 14 years, nor with allergic sensitisation to other
allergens. The GRADE certainty of these findings was moderate for eczema and low for cow’s
milk sensitisation. Subgroup analysis for eczema showed a significant difference between sup-
plementing mothers during the postnatal period (9 interventions, RR 0.64; 95% CI 0.51–0.80;
I2 = 59%) and studies that just supplemented infants during the postnatal period (11 inter-
ventions, RR 0.93; 95% CI 0.81–1.06; I2 = 31%; test for subgroup difference P = 0.016). Ten
intervention trials (4,242 participants) evaluated prebiotic supplements (always a galacto-oli-
gosaccharide) either alone or combined with other prebiotics or with probiotics. Nine studies
involved comparison of an infant formula milk with versus without prebiotic. Meta-analysis
showed no clear evidence that prebiotic supplementation reduces eczema at age � 4 years
(Fig 6; 7 studies; RR 0.75; 95% CI 0.56–1.01; I2 = 57%) and no association at age 5 to 14 years.
There was no association between probiotics or prebiotics and other allergic outcomes. In our
updated search on 15 December 2017, we identified one publication reporting no effect of a
perinatal probiotic supplement on risk of coeliac disease at age 13 years from the trial of Kuk-
konen [20]. No other studies reported autoimmune outcomes.
Polyunsaturated fatty acid supplementation.
Nineteen intervention trials (14,479 partic-
ipants) evaluated fatty acid supplements. These were given as fish oil supplements in 12 trials,
advice to eat oily fish in 1 trial, supplementation of infant formula milk with omega-3 fatty
acids in 3 trials, and other oils in 3 trials. Comparators were corn, soya, canola, olive, sun-
flower, or vegetable oil, or no supplement. Meta-analysis showed an association between
omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid supplementation using fish oil during pregnancy and lac-
tation and reduced allergic sensitisation to egg at 1 year (Fig 7; 6 studies; RR 0.69 95% CI 0.53–
0.90; I2 = 15%). No significant association was seen with allergic sensitisation to other aller-
gens. The GRADE certainty of this finding was moderate. Subgroup analysis showed a signifi-
cant difference between studies which supplemented mothers during pregnancy (4 studies; RR
0.55 95% CI 0.40–0.76; I2 = 0%) and studies which supplemented during lactation only (2

 studies; RR 0.92 95% CI 0.65–1.28; I2 = 0%; test for subgroup difference P = 0.032). Similarly,
for allergic sensitisation to peanut, there was reduced risk in the subgroup of studies which
supplemented mothers during pregnancy (2 studies; RR 0.62 95% CI 0.40–0.96 I2 = 0%). There
was no association between omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid supplementation and other
allergic outcomes. Data were sparse and inconclusive for food allergy and for omega-6 supple-
mentation and allergic outcomes. No autoimmune outcomes were reported, and no new trials
were identified in our update search on 15 December 2017.
Maternal allergenic food avoidance and multifaceted interventions.
Twelve interven-
tion trials (1,945 participants) evaluated maternal allergenic food avoidance during pregnancy
(2 trials), lactation (6 trials), or both (4 trials). The foods excluded were milk alone (2 trials),
egg alone (1 trial), milk and egg (3 trials), or multiple foods (6 trials). We did not find that
maternal allergenic food avoidance during pregnancy or lactation reduces risk of allergic dis-
ease or TIDM development. Nine trials (2,317 participants) evaluated multifaceted interven-
tions—defined as an intervention with more than one category of dietary intervention. Six
trials included promotion of prolonged breastfeeding, avoidance of allergenic foods for mother
or infant, and delayed solid food introduction; 6 included environmental control measures to
reduce dust mite, pet, or tobacco smoke exposure; 7 used an alternative formula milk as part of
the intervention. Meta-analysis shown in Fig 8 found an association between multifaceted
interventions and reduced allergic rhinitis at age � 4 years (2 studies; RR 0.61 95% CI 0.44–
0.84; I2 = 0%), but not at age 5 to 14 years (4 studies). We also found an association between

 multifaceted interventions and reduced wheeze (2 studies; RR 0.57 95% CI 0.41–0.81; I2 = 0%)
and recurrent wheeze (4 studies; RR 0.77 95% CI 0.61–0.97; I2 = 0%) at age 5–14 years. There
was no association at age � 4 years (4 studies), nor with measures of lung function. The
GRADE certainty of findings for multifaceted interventions and wheeze or rhinitis was low,
there were no autoimmune outcomes reported, and no new trials were identified in our update
search on 15 December 2017.
Vitamin and mineral supplementation.
Eleven intervention trials (15,753 participants)
evaluated vitamin and mineral supplements. Two trials used vitamin A in infants; 1 used vita-
min A or beta carotene in pregnancy; 2 used vitamin C or E during pregnancy; 3 used vitamin
D during pregnancy; 1 used vitamin D during pregnancy and infancy; and 2 used multivita-
mins during pregnancy. Meta-analysis shown in Fig 9 found no association between vitamin
supplementation and risk of wheeze (5 studies), recurrent wheeze (6 studies), or eczema (5
studies) at age 0 to 4 years, nor for these outcomes at other ages or other allergic outcomes.
One trial reported an association between vitamin A (but not beta carotene) supplementation
during pregnancy and increased lung function in childhood [21]. This was not consistent with
findings from another similar trial [22]. No autoimmune outcomes were reported, and no new
trials were identified in our update search on 15 December 2017.

 Observational studies of other maternal or infant dietary exposures
Ninety-two observational studies (485,733 participants) evaluated other maternal or infant die-
tary exposures, including fruit and vegetable intake (35 studies), classified as fruits, vegetables,
citrus fruits, nuts, or sometimes as individual foods or food groups; fat and fatty acid intake
(26 studies), classified as total fat intake, omega 3 or omega 6 poly-unsaturated fatty acids or
other types of fatty acids, and specific fatty acids (we also included fish intake and fish oil sup-
plementation in this group); vitamin and mineral intake (50 studies), including antioxidant
vitamins A, C, E, and their precursors, vitamin D and folic acid, mineral intake, and blood
vitamin D levels; and a wide range of ‘other dietary exposures’ (47 studies), including dietary
pattern, maternal allergenic food avoidance, alcohol, tea or coffee intake, and maternal or
infant meat, cereal, milk, or egg intake. Opportunities for meta-analysis of these observational
studies were very limited due to heterogeneity of exposure assessment methods and reporting
—all analyses are described in the full Food Standards Agency report (https://www.food.gov.
uk/science/research/allergy-research/fs305005ac). Overall, there was no consistent association
between these dietary exposures and risk of allergic outcomes or those autoimmune diseases
studied (TIDM, 23 studies; coeliac disease, 2 studies; inflammatory bowel disease, 2 studies;
juvenile idiopathic arthritis, 1 study). There was insufficient evidence to either support or
refute the intervention trial findings for fish oil supplementation and allergic sensitization to
foods, in the observational studies of fatty acid intake during pregnancy.
Trial sequential analysis of moderate or high certainty findings
We used TSA to evaluate whether probiotics reduce risk of eczema by �20% or �30%. The
heterogeneity-adjusted optimal information size for detection of a 20% relative risk reduction
for eczema was 3,780 study participants, and TSA for this outcome is shown in Fig 10. The
optimal information size has not been reached, but the monitoring boundary has been crossed,

 suggesting that this treatment reduces eczema risk by �20%. Findings were similar for �30%
risk reduction, for atopic eczema, and for the subgroup of studies that supplemented lactating
mothers during the postnatal period (Fig 10). TSA for studies that didn’t supplement lactating
mothers showed evidence of futility (Fig 10). We also used TSA to evaluate whether maternal
fish oil supplementation reduces risk of allergic sensitisation to egg by �20% or �30% (Fig
11). The optimal information size for detection of a 20% relative risk reduction was 6,786 par-
ticipants, which has not been reached, and the monitoring boundary has not been crossed,
suggesting that further studies are required to confirm the effect.
Discussion
Principal findings
In this systematic review of diet during pregnancy and infancy and risk of allergic or autoim-
mune disease, we found a relationship between maternal diet during pregnancy and lactation
and eczema or allergic sensitisation to food during childhood. Positive health effects were
found for probiotic and fish oil supplements. We found weaker support for the hypotheses
that multifaceted interventions reduce risk of allergic rhinitis and wheeze; that longer duration
of breastfeeding is associated with reduced eczema, TIDM, and wheezing; and that longer
exclusive breastfeeding is associated with reduced TIDM. There was no association between
other dietary exposures and risk of allergic or autoimmune diseases, including timing of solid
food introduction, prebiotic supplementation, maternal allergenic food avoidance, and vita-
min, mineral, fruit, or vegetable intake. Previously, we reported that hydrolysed formula does
not appear to influence risk of allergic or autoimmune diseases and that early peanut or egg
introduction to the infant diet reduces risk of peanut or egg allergy [12,13]. Taken together,
our findings suggest that while infant diet may influence immune development through aller-
gen-specific mechanisms, maternal diet during prenatal life and lactation may have broader
effects on the developing immune system. Future efforts to promote immune health through
the life course should consider maternal dietary interventions during pregnancy and lactation
as an important area of investigation. Our finding that probiotic supplements such as Lactoba-
cillus rhamnosus at a dose of 1 to 10 billion colony-forming units per day may reduce risk of
eczema is consistent with a recent World Allergy Organization (WAO) systematic review and
guideline, although we rated the certainty of findings as stronger than the WAO group, who
downgraded the certainty to very low due to risk of selection and attrition bias in the trials,
variation in probiotic(s) used, and variation in the timing of the probiotic supplement inter-
vention [3,10]. Our subgroup analysis and TSA findings provide new evidence that maternal
(rather than infant) supplementation may be important for this intervention. In contrast, we
did not find support for the WAO group’s recommendation to use prebiotic supplements such
as galacto-oligosaccharides for preventing eczema due to our serious concerns about risk of
bias, inconsistency, imprecision, and indirectness, some of which were shared by the WAO
group [2,23]. Although microbial exposures have long been postulated as influencing risk of
allergic disease, a clear mechanism through which probiotics might reduce risk of eczema is
currently lacking. Our finding that fish oil supplementation during pregnancy may reduce
allergic sensitisation to the most common food allergens affecting young children, hen’s egg
and peanut, is new. In contrast to our findings for probiotics, those for fish oil have a plausible
mechanistic basis, since fish oil has known anti-inflammatory effects [24].Further work is

 required to clarify whether the effect of fish oil on allergic sensitisation leads to reduced risk of
clinical food allergy. We did not find support for recent Australasian guidelines or other sys-
tematic reviews suggesting that fish or fish oil supplementation may reduce eczema risk
[6,25,26]. Other findings were of low or very low GRADE certainty and are not likely to impact
infant feeding guidance at present. The findings for multifaceted interventions and reduced
risk of rhinitis or wheezing are unlikely to be related to dietary components of the interven-
tions, and the findings that longer breastfeeding or exclusive breastfeeding duration may
reduce risk of TIDM, eczema, and wheezing are not likely to change current breastfeeding rec-
ommendations [14]. Others have reported stronger support for an association between breast-
feeding duration and reduced risk of wheezing or other allergic outcomes, but only by pooling
quite heterogeneous data [8,9]. Our meta-analyses of observational studies of breastfeeding
duration and wheezing found new evidence of publication bias, which also suggests that previ-
ous reports of links between breastfeeding and wheezing may be misleading. We did not find
evidence to support a role for vitamin D supplementation in preventing wheezing or other
outcomes. This is consistent with a WAO systematic review [27] that was undertaken prior to
the publication of two key vitamin D trials. Two other recent analyses concluded that prenatal
vitamin D supplementation may reduce risk of recurrent wheeze. A systematic review of pre-
natal vitamins and allergic outcomes did not identify one of our included trials and made a
data entry error in another trial (Goldring et al. control and active data switched) [28]. A
meta-analysis of the two largest trials, undertaken by their authors, also had positive findings
but did not include the other two published studies which we identified [29]. Overall, we
found relatively few opportunities for meaningful meta-analysis in the observational studies,
due mainly to variations in exposure definition and assessment. Even when observational

 study meta-analysis is possible, differences between populations studied or methods of expo-
sure assessment can lead to increased variability of findings and thereby reduce statistical
power compared with a single large, well-conducted study. This may partly explain the stron-
ger findings in relation to intervention trials of dietary supplements than for observational
studies of dietary pattern or specific nutritional intake.
Interpretation
Our key findings suggest that a mother’s diet during pregnancy and lactation may influence
the risk that her child develops allergic disease, and this has implications for future research in
this field. There are two specific implications for pregnant women. First, a daily probiotic sup-
plement such as L. rhamnosus, taken from around 36 to 38 weeks gestation through the first 3
to 6 months of lactation, may reduce risk of eczema in the child. Although probiotics are gen-
erally considered safe, their pro-inflammatory effects may have potential adverse consequences
when used earlier in pregnancy, and serious adverse effects in people with intestinal disorders
or immune deficiency have been documented [30][31]. Second, a fish oil supplement, taken
from around 20 weeks gestation through the first 3 to 4 months of lactation, may reduce risk
of allergic sensitisation to egg or peanut in the child. In one included trial, the fish oil interven-
tion was administered via advice to consume at least 2 servings per week of low mercury oily
fish (farmed salmon), which is consistent with current United States Food and Drug Adminis-
tration guidance [32]. It was not possible to reliably assess whether the findings in this small
trial differed significantly from the findings in higher dose fish oil supplementation trials.
Strengths and limitations of the study
This comprehensive and wide-ranging systematic review has highlighted key dietary interven-
tions that may reduce risk of allergic outcomes, information which will be useful for pregnant
women and their healthcare providers. However, for many dietary exposures, data were incon-
clusive or inconsistent, such that we are unable to exclude the possibility of beneficial or harm-
ful effects. One limitation of this study is the 2013 search date for observational studies, such
that review findings that are derived from these studies may benefit from an update in due
course. We included abstract publications, since their exclusion can lead to publication bias;
however, their inclusion carries a risk of methodological bias due to the lack of peer review.
While the list of dietary exposures included was comprehensive, we did not evaluate food
diversity during infancy, which has been suggested as an important factor in relation to allergic
outcomes, and we did not evaluate objective markers of nutritional status, with the exception
of blood vitamin D level [33]. This means that we may have missed important relationships for
food diversity or nutritional markers. Given the volume of titles included in this systematic
review, we were unable to contact the corresponding authors of included studies for data veri-
fication, as has been recommended by some authors [34]. Finally, some outcome measures
were reported using a wide variety of assessment tools—for example, wheeze and recurrent
wheeze were defined in several different ways—and this may have contributed to some of the
statistical heterogeneity seen in meta-analyses. There is a need for more well-powered inter-
vention trials of dietary interventions, given the positive findings with some specific dietary
supplements identified here.
Conclusions and policy implications
These findings, together with our previous findings regarding hydrolysed formula and aller-
genic food introduction to the infant diet, suggest that current infant feeding guidance needs
revision. Guideline committees will need to carefully consider the key findings together with
