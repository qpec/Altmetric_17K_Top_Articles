The effect of fasting prior to morning exercise on 24-hour energy intake was examined using a randomized, counterbalanced design.
Participants (12 active, white males, 20.8 ± 3.0 years old, VO2max: 59.1 ± 5.7 mL/kg/min) fasted (NoBK) or received breakfast
(BK) and then ran for 60 minutes at 60% VO2max. All food was weighed and measured for 24 hours. Measures of blood glucose
and hunger were collected at 5 time points. Respiratory quotient (RQ) was measured during exercise. Generalized linear mixed
models and paired sample 𝑡-tests examined differences between the conditions. Total 24-hour (BK: 19172 ± 4542 kJ versus NoBK:
15312 ± 4513 kJ; 𝑝 < 0.001) and evening (BK: 12265 ± 4278 kJ versus NoBK: 10833 ± 4065; 𝑝 = 0.039) energy intake and RQ
(BK: 0.90 ± 0.03 versus NoBK: 0.86 ± 0.03; 𝑝 < 0.001) were significantly higher in BK than NoBK. Blood glucose was significantly
higher in BK than NoBK before exercise (5.2 ± 0.7 versus 4.5 ± 0.6 mmol/L; 𝑝 = 0.025). Hunger was significantly lower for BK than
NoBK before exercise, after exercise, and before lunch. Blood glucose and hunger were not associated with energy intake. Fasting
before morning exercise decreased 24-hour energy intake and increased fat oxidation during exercise. Completing exercise in the
morning in the fasted state may have implications for weight management.
1. Introduction
Manipulating dietary intake can be beneficial for athletes and
active individuals striving towards improvements in fitness
and body composition [1]. Improvements in weight manage-
ment are a common motivator for individuals to begin and
adhere to regular exercise [2]. Competitive athletes also focus
on weight as body composition may have an impact on an
athlete’s cardiorespiratory fitness, strength, agility, overall
performance, and appearance [1]. Energy balance, the rela-
tionship between energy consumed and energy expended, is
a simple equation on paper but is a complicated concept in
practice that ultimately determines whether an individual’s
weight increases, decreases, or stays the same [3]. Exercise
has been found to alter energy balance by increasing energy
expended as well as by modifying energy intake [4, 5].
Research has shown that, following a single bout of exercise,
individuals will typically either reduce energy intake acutely
or wait an extended time before initiating food consumption,
leading to a short-term energy deficit [5–7]. While some
researches suggest that this acute energy shortage may help
produce a negative energy balance conducive for weight loss
[8], others suggest that individuals compensate for energy
expended by eating more later in the day, thus negating any
potential benefits for weight loss [9].
A variable that may modify the effects exercise has on
energy intake is whether the exercise is completed in a fed or
fasted state. Within the past decade training in a state of low
carbohydrate availability, often referred to as “training low,”
has become a popular technique for athletes and in sports
nutrition research [10]. There are a variety of ways by which
reducing carbohydrate availability can be achieved. One
common protocol is exercising after an overnight fast [11].
While training low has shown some potential physiological
benefits in exercise performance [12], the effect of exercise in
a fasted state on energy balance is not well understood. Only
one study has examined the effect of fasting prior to morning
exercise on energy intake[13]. The authors found that there

was no difference in energy intake at the meal immediately
after exercise but a higher overall energy intake on the days
when breakfast was consumed [13]. These results suggest that
skipping breakfast prior to morning exercise may aid with
reducing overall energy intake. However, this effect has only
been examined in one study and the results are limited to only
one meal consumed in the laboratory setting immediately
after exercise.
Another potential role for fasting in weight and body
composition management is that exercising in the fasted state
has been shown to alter macronutrient catabolism during
exercise. The body relies more on fat as a substrate when
exercising in the fasted state [14, 15]. An increase in fat
oxidation during exercise could encourage body fat reduc-
tions and athletes have reported attempting to reduce body
fat by exercising after fasting [16, 17]. Thus, skipping breakfast
prior to exercise may potentially help decrease weight and
body fat by reducing energy intake and increasing fat oxi-
dation. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect
of fasting prior to exercise on the 24-hour energy intake and
substrate oxidation during exercise in active males. It was
hypothesized that participants would consume less energy
and oxidize more fat during exercise on the days they fasted.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Participants. A convenience sample of active men was
recruited for this randomized, counterbalanced experimental
study through flyers on a university campus in Pennsylva-
nia, United States of America. Inclusion criteria included
being male, active [as measured by a minimum VO2max of
43.9 mg/kg/min (50th percentile, American College of Sports
Medicine Guidelines, 9th Ed.)] [18], recreational runners
(self-reported running at least 30 minutes, 3 times per week
for the past month), between 18 and 30 years of age, and usual
breakfast consumers (defined as regularly eating breakfast at
least 5 times per week). Participants were excluded if they
reported a known or suspected wheat or gluten allergy, if they
reported having any blood-transmittable diseases, or if they
had diabetes mellitus. Twelve participants were recruited for
the study to be adequately powered (0.8) to detect an effect
size of 0.8 (for differences in total 24-hour energy intake)
with the significance level set at 0.05 [19]. Institutional review
board approval was obtained prior to initiating any study
procedures.
2.2. Baseline Measurements. After completing a phone
screen, participants completed a demographics question-
naire, written informed consent, and Physical Activity Readi-
ness Questionnaire (PAR-Q) [20]. Baseline measurements
included height and weight without shoes and outer layers
of clothing. Body density was measured using air displace-
ment plethysmography (BodPod, Life Measurement, Inc.,
Concord, California, USA) with relative body fat determined
using the Siri equation [21]. A treadmill VO2max test was used
to confirm aerobic fitness criteria and to determine running
speed during the trials.
The VO2max test consisted of a graded treadmill exercise
test beginning at 6 miles per hour (mph) and 0% grade,
with speed increasing by 1 mph per minute until 9 mph was
reached; then grade increased by 1% per min, continuing
until the participant reached volitional fatigue. VO2max was
confirmed with a plateau in oxygen consumption (not greater
than 2 mL/kg/min after an increase in workload), a Rating
of Perceived Exertion (RPE) ≥ 18, a Respiratory Exchange
Ratio greater than 1.10, or a heart rate at 90% or greater of
estimated maximal heart rate (calculated as 220−age) [22]. If
a plateau in VO2 was not elicited, a majority of the criteria
for determining VO2max must have been met. Participants
were randomized to trials (Order 1: breakfast trial followed
by fasting trial or Order 2: fasting trial followed by breakfast
trial) by the researchers picking a number 1 or 2 out of an
envelope.
2.3. Experimental Design. Each participant completed two
trials, one week apart, in this crossover study design. In
this study, participants were asked to consume the same
foods (using their 24-hour food diary from the day prior
to both trials) and avoid strenuous exercise during the 24
hours prior to each trial. Participants were also asked to
consume at least 500 mL of water at 8 pm and fast and avoid
alcohol and caffeine [23] starting at 10 pm in the evening
prior to the trials. When asked as to their compliance with
these directives, all participants answered in the affirmative.
Participants were blinded to the purpose of the study and
did not know which condition they would receive until they
arrived at the laboratory.
Participants arrived at the laboratory and received either
breakfast (BK) or no breakfast (NoBK) at 8 am (see Figure 1
for a diagram of the study protocol). Participants in the
breakfast trial received a combination of oatmeal and orange
juice for breakfast that provided 2 grams of carbohydrate per
kilogram of body weight and water ad libitum. The breakfast
was high in carbohydrates and low in protein and fat (2298 ±
371 kJ, 82.8 ± 1.5% carbohydrates, 10.2 ± 0.4% protein, and
10.6 ± 1.2% fat) as recommended for a meal 2 hours prior to
exercise [1]. Participants were required to consume all of the
provided food and at least 500 mL of water. Participants in
the fasting trial received water ad libitum, being required to
consume at least 500 mL.
At 10 am, participants completed a 1-hour treadmill run
at a speed that approximated 60% of their VO2max using
the ACSM running equation [18]. After the run, participants
received water ad libitum and rested until lunch.
One hour after the completion of the treadmill run,
participants were offered lunch at which they were told to
eat until they were comfortably full. Lunch consisted of 3
turkey sandwiches (each sandwich was 2 slices of whole
wheat bread (86 grams (g)) and turkey (90 g) for all, and
participants could choose iceberg lettuce (15 g), tomato (21 g),
mustard (2 teaspoons) or mayonnaise (1 tablespoon) which
was held consistent between trials), 0.5 bag of Lay’s potato
chips (170 g), 10 Chips Ahoy chocolate chip cookies (110 g),
and apples (450 g) cut into slices with the core removed. The

lunch each participant was offered provided 9665 kJ and was
53% carbohydrate, 14% protein, and 33% fat.
After lunch, participants were provided with a bag of food
to take home. Participants were asked to eat only foods that
were contained in the bag for the remainder of the day and
to consume as much or as little of the food as they would
like. In the take home bag, participants received 1 box of
cooked pasta (454 g) mixed with 1 jar of tomato sauce (680 g),
4 slices of whole wheat bread (172 g), grapes (400 g), 10 Oreo
cookies (120 g), and a half gallon of 1% milk (1920 g). The
foods in the take home bag provided 19800 kJ and were 65%
carbohydrate, 15% protein, and 20% fat. Participants were
asked to record their food and beverage intake. All food that
was not consumed by the participant was returned to the
laboratory on the following morning.
2.4. Energy and Macronutrient Intake Assessment. All food
provided to participants for 24 hours was weighed (Edlund,
E-Series E-160, Burlington, VT, USA) by research staff. The
amount consumed was calculated by subtracting the amount
remaining from the amount provided and then entered into
Nutrition Data Systems for Research version 2014 (University
of Minnesota Nutrition Coordinating Center, Minneapolis,
MN, USA). Total energy intake was calculated by summing
the energy consumed at breakfast (if consumed), buffet lunch,
and all food eaten from the take home bag in the evening.
“After lunch” energy intake was calculated as the total energy
consumed from the foods in the take home bag.
2.5. Respiratory Quotient (RQ) and Energy Expenditure Assess-
ment. During the run, expired air was collected (CareFusion,
Vmax Encore, Yorba Linda, CA, USA) and the volume of oxy-
gen consumed (VO2) and carbon dioxide produced (VCO2)
were recorded for 5-minute periods from 0–5, 15–20, 35–40,
and 55–60 minutes. Nonprotein RQ was calculated as the
ratio of carbon dioxide produced to oxygen consumed. Total
energy expended during the exercise was calculated from
VO2 using the Weir equation (1949):
kcal = ((1.1 × RQ) + 3.9) × VO2 (L/min) ,
(1)
where VO2 (L/min) is the absolute O2 consumption and
protein metabolism was considered to be negligible. This
was multiplied by 60 minutes and converted into kJ by
multiplying kcal by 4.186.
2.6. Blood Glucose and Hunger Assessment. Blood glucose
and hunger measurements were taken at five time points:
immediately on arrival to the laboratory (arrival), right
before exercise (preexercise), within five minutes after exer-
cise (postexercise), right before lunch (prelunch), and right
after lunch (postlunch). Glucometers (Bayer Contour 9545C,
Bayer HealthCare LLC, Mishawaka, IN, USA) and test strips
(Bayer Healthcare LLC, Mishawaka, IN, USA) were used to
determine blood glucose. Hunger was measured on a 100 mm
Visual Analog Scale anchored with “0, Not hungry at all”
and “100, Extremely hungry.” Blood glucose and hunger were
measured throughout the trial to potentially help explain any
differences in energy intake between trials. Participants were
also asked to complete a hunger scale prior to eating each
time they ate a meal or snack after they left the laboratory. An
average hunger score was calculated for the postlunch eating
occasions.
2.7. Statistical Analysis. Participant characteristics were
examined using means and standard deviations for contin-
uous variables and frequency distributions for categorical
variables. The normality of the distribution of data from
each variable was assessed using a Shapiro-Wilk test. Data
were found to be normally distributed with the exception
of the subjective ratings of hunger. Paired sample 𝑡-tests
were used to examine differences in 24-hour, breakfast,
lunch, and postlunch energy intake, RQ, energy expenditure,
and average postlunch hunger rating between the con-
ditions. Results were considered significant at a minimum
of 𝑝 < 0.05. Statistical analyses of blood glucose and hunger
were completed using a generalized linear mixed model.
Different covariance structures were assumed and the one
that minimized the Hurvich and Tsai’s criterion was chosen
for the final model. Where a significant 𝐹 ratio was observed,
post hoc comparisons with Sidak-adjusted 𝑝 values were
used to identify which pairs of means were significantly
different. Two-tailed statistical significance was accepted at a
minimum of 𝑝 < 0.05. Data were analyzed using IBM-SPSS,
version 23.

There were no significant differences in participant baseline
demographic characteristics, body composition, or fitness
levels between orders (Table 1). There were no significant

for one participant was incomplete and thus RQ and energy
expenditure analyses include eleven participants rather than
twelve.
3.1. Energy and Macronutrient Intake. Total 24-hour energy
intake was significantly (𝑝 < 0.001) higher during the BK trial
than the NoBK trial (Table 2). During the BK trial, eleven of
the twelve participants consumed more energy over 24 hours
(Figure 2). As planned, participants in the BK trial consumed
significantly more for breakfast than the NoBK trial. There
were no significant differences in energy intake at lunch. After
lunch energy intake was significantly (𝑝 = 0.039) higher
during BK than NoBK. There were no significant differences
in macronutrient distribution of the foods consumed for the
total 24 hours (BK: 67.4 ± 3.5% carbohydrate, 12.9 ± 1.8%
protein, and 22.1±4.0% fat; NoBK: 64.8±5.8% carbohydrate,

differences in the average hunger for the postlunch eating

4. Discussion
This study examined the effect of fasting prior to exercise
on 24-hour energy intake and substrate oxidation in active
males. We confirmed our hypothesis that when participants
fasted, they consumed less energy over a 24-hour period and
relied more on fat as an energy source during exercise. In fact,
11 of the 12 participants consumed less energy on the days
they fasted and oxidized more fat during the run. What we
did not expect to find was that when participants fasted they
also consumed less energy during their evening meals and
snacks compared to the days when they ate breakfast. The
reduced 24-hour energy intake on fasting days was not only
due to the fact that breakfast was skipped but also due to a
decreased energy intake at night. This finding suggests that
fasting prior to exercise may suppress energy intake over an
extended period of time.
With a growing interest in exercising in a state of reduced
carbohydrate availability (“training low”), it is important to
discover the effects these protocols may have on a variety of
physiologic markers. Previous research on training low has
found some beneficial improvements in markers that could
potentially lead to improvements in athletic performance
[10, 11]. Training low can be achieved through a variety
of techniques, one of which is exercising in a fasted state.
Only one study has examined the effect of fasting prior to
exercise on energy intake [13]. This study found that fasting
had no effect on energy intake immediately after exercise.
The current study also found no effect of fasting on energy
intake immediately after exercise but did find suppression in
energy intake at the meals and snacks later on in the day. The
combination of skipping breakfast and exercising in the fasted
state may have an additive effect on suppressing energy intake
hours after exercise is completed. It is currently unknown if
following this type of protocol over a prolonged period of
time could have implications for weight management.
As a means to explain the mechanism behind why fasting
may affect daily energy intake, we collected measurements
of blood glucose and hunger while the participants were in
the laboratory. The glucostatic theory for energy regulation
suggests that declines in blood glucose levels will trigger
meal initiation and that a meal will continue to be consumed
until blood glucose levels reach a preferred range [24–26].
According to this theory, beginning a meal with a lower
 6
Journal of Nutrition and Metabolism
blood glucose level would promote consumption of a larger
volume of food. Our finding of no differences in blood
glucose immediately prior to eating lunch may partially
explain why there were no differences in energy intake at
lunch between the conditions. Our participants were healthy
and active young males and that may explain why even with
the breakfast manipulation blood glucose remained within
normal levels and did not differ between conditions other
than right before exercise. An interesting finding of our study
was that participants consumed more energy in the evening
on the days when they consumed breakfast. Blood glucose
was only collected while participants were in the laboratory
and, consequently, we are not able to conclude if blood
glucose had an effect on energy intake at night.
Hunger may be another factor that can explain differences
in energy intake at a meal. It is commonly assumed that
the hungrier an individual feels prior to meal consumption,
the more energy they will consume at that meal. While this
can sometimes be the case, there are many variables that
determine energy consumption behaviors such as availability
of palatable food, the macronutrient content of the food,
and the social and emotional state of the individual that
may limit the role of hunger as a predictor of energy intake
[27]. Participants in this study reported higher levels of
hunger before lunch during the fasting trial but we found no
differences in energy intake at lunch, suggesting that hunger
did not regulate participant energy intake after exercise.
Hunger and energy intake were also not related to the evening
meals and snacks as participants reported no differences in
the average level of hunger prior to eating even though they
consumed significantly more energy in the evenings on the
days when breakfast was consumed. Therefore, hunger was
not a reliable predictor of energy intake in our study.
In agreement with previous research, [13–15] we indi-
rectly showed that participants used more fat for fuel during
exercise after fasting. While some research suggests that the
effect of exercise on fat oxidation beyond fuel utilization dur-
ing exercise is minimal and may have a negligible effect on fat
loss over time [14], a recently published study found that the
timing of the exercise and the prandial state of participants
(fasted versus fed) modulates the effect of exercise on fat
oxidation in the postexercise period [28]. This research found
that when 60 minutes of continuous exercise was performed
in the morning before eating, there was a greater increase
in 24-hour fat oxidation than when participants ate prior to
exercise or when they exercised later in the day. The increase
in fat oxidation was also associated with a greater negative
energy balance, suggesting that exercising in the fasted state
in the morning may potentially help decrease fat mass and aid
weight loss, although longer term studies are needed prior to
coming to this conclusion.
Observational studies suggest an association between
breakfast consumption and weight such that habitually skip-
ping breakfast is associated with a higher weight and greater
weight gain over time [29–31]. However, as summarized in
a review by Brown et al., 2013, these findings have not been
confirmed by the few randomized controlled trials that have
examined this relationship and articles have often misrepre-
sented the causality or the strength of the association [32].
In fact, our findings add to a growing area of research that
suggests skipping breakfast may result in a reduced energy
intake.
The limitations of this study include the small sample of
active males which reduces the generalizability of our results
to other populations as well as the application beyond the
effects on energy intake for one day. An additional limitation
of our study is that substrate oxidation and fuel utilization
were only measured during exercise and blood glucose was
only measured while participants were in the laboratory and
thus we do not know the role these factors may have had on
energy intake outside of these times. A strength of this study
includes that dietary intake was weighed and measured and
did not rely on participant self-report.
Future research examining the effect of skipping breakfast
prior to exercise on energy intake in a variety of populations
over a longer period of time is needed. Particularly, the
potential role of exercising in the fasted state in weight
management would be of interest to a broad population.
Investigating the mechanism behind the role of breakfast
skipping prior to exercise on appetite and energy intake with
a particular focus on appetite regulating hormones such as
insulin, leptin, and ghrelin could help to explain our findings.
Additionally, directly examining a measure of fat utilization
as well as examining fuel utilization over an extended period
of time could help explain the role fasting before exercise may
have on manipulating body composition.
5. Conclusions
With the increasing popularity of “training low” protocols
that encourage exercising after an overnight fast, it is impor-
tant that the effects these protocols have on a variety of
physiologic components be examined. Particularly, as many
athletes and active individuals are interested in improv-
ing both physical fitness and body composition, the effect
exercising in the fasted state has on energy balance is of
interest. Our results add to a growing area of research that
suggests that fasting prior to exercise may be advantageous
for reducing energy intake and increasing fat oxidation which
have potential implications for weight and body composition
management.
