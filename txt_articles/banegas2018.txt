BACKGROUND
Evidence for the influence of ambulatory blood pressure on prognosis derives mainly 
from population-based studies and a few relatively small clinical investigations. This 
study examined the associations of blood pressure measured in the clinic (clinic blood 
pressure) and 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure with all-cause and cardiovascular 
mortality in a large cohort of patients in primary care.
METHODS
We analyzed data from a registry-based, multicenter, national cohort that included 
63,910 adults recruited from 2004 through 2014 in Spain. Clinic and 24-hour ambula-
tory blood-pressure data were examined in the following categories: sustained hyper-
tension (elevated clinic and elevated 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure), “white-coat” 
hypertension (elevated clinic and normal 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure), masked 
hypertension (normal clinic and elevated 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure), and 
normotension (normal clinic and normal 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure). Analy-
ses were conducted with Cox regression models, adjusted for clinic and 24-hour am-
bulatory blood pressures and for confounders.
RESULTS
During a median follow-up of 4.7 years, 3808 patients died from any cause, and 1295 
of these patients died from cardiovascular causes. In a model that included both 24-
hour and clinic measurements, 24-hour systolic pressure was more strongly associated 
with all-cause mortality (hazard ratio, 1.58 per 1-SD increase in pressure; 95% confi-
dence interval [CI], 1.56 to 1.60, after adjustment for clinic blood pressure) than the 
clinic systolic pressure (hazard ratio, 1.02; 95% CI, 1.00 to 1.04, after adjustment for 
24-hour blood pressure). Corresponding hazard ratios per 1-SD increase in pressure 
were 1.55 (95% CI, 1.53 to 1.57, after adjustment for clinic and daytime blood pressures) 
for nighttime ambulatory systolic pressure and 1.54 (95% CI, 1.52 to 1.56, after adjust-
ment for clinic and nighttime blood pressures) for daytime ambulatory systolic pres-
sure. These relationships were consistent across subgroups of age, sex, and status with 
respect to obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and antihypertensive treatment. 
Masked hypertension was more strongly associated with all-cause mortality (hazard 
ratio, 2.83; 95% CI, 2.12 to 3.79) than sustained hypertension (hazard ratio, 1.80; 95% 
CI, 1.41 to 2.31) or white-coat hypertension (hazard ratio, 1.79; 95% CI, 1.38 to 2.32). 
Results for cardiovascular mortality were similar to those for all-cause mortality.
CONCLUSIONS
Ambulatory blood-pressure measurements were a stronger predictor of all-cause and 
cardiovascular mortality than clinic blood-pressure measurements. White-coat hyperten-
sion was not benign, and masked hypertension was associated with a greater risk of death 
than sustained hypertension. (Funded by the Spanish Society of Hypertension and others.)

The new engl and jour nal of medicine
A
mbulatory blood-pressure data 
provide a more comprehensive assess-
ment of blood pressure over the course of 
a day and have been reported to better predict 
health outcomes than blood pressure measured 
in the clinic (clinic blood pressure) or at home.1-3 
Evidence for the influence of ambulatory blood 
pressure on prognosis is derived mainly from 
population-based studies4-7 and a few relatively 
small clinical investigations.8-11 However, in these 
studies, the number of clinical outcomes was 
limited, which reduced the ability to assess the 
predictive value of clinic blood-pressure data as 
compared with ambulatory data. In addition, 
whether the average ambulatory blood pressure 
over the nighttime, the daytime, or the full 24 
hours is the strongest predictor of mortality re-
mains uncertain.3-8,10,12,13 Moreover, the implica-
tions of hypertension phenotypes, such as “white-
coat” hypertension and masked hypertension, with 
regard to mortality have remained ill-defined, 
mainly because of the small number of events 
reported in previous studies.14-23
We report the prognostic value of clinic and 
ambulatory blood pressures, as well as of hyper-
tension phenotypes, on total and cardiovascular 
mortality. We used data from the Spanish Ambu-
latory Blood Pressure Registry, which includes a 
large cohort of patients in primary care practice.
Methods
Study Oversight
This study was supported by the Spanish Society 
of Hypertension, Lacer Laboratories, and Euro-
pean government agencies. The funding sources 
had no role in the design of the study, the col-
lection and analysis of the data, the interpreta-
tion of results, the writing of the report, or the 
decision to submit the report for publication.
The study protocol and analyses were ap-
proved by the institutional review board for all 
participating centers. The authors vouch for the 
accuracy and completeness of the data. The full 
list of investigators is provided in the Supple-
mentary Appendix, available with the full text of 
this article at NEJM.org.
Patient Population
Data for this study were obtained from the on-
going Spanish Ambulatory Blood Pressure Reg-
istry, a national study of patients selected by 
their physicians at 223 primary care centers 
within the Spanish National Health System in all 
the 17 regions of Spain.24,25 Patients were required 
to be 18 years of age or older and to meet 
guideline-recommended indications for ambula-
tory blood-pressure monitoring,24-28 which includ-
ed suspected white-coat hypertension, refractory 
or resistant hypertension, high-risk hypertension, 
and labile or borderline hypertension, as well as 
assessment of drug-treatment efficacy and study 
of the circadian blood-pressure pattern (details 
are provided in the Supplementary Appendix). 
All patients included in the registry provided 
written informed consent.
The current study is an analysis of mortality 
among 66,636 persons 18 years of age or older 
who were enrolled in the registry between 
March 1, 2004, and December 31, 2014. Of these, 
2726 were excluded because of incomplete infor-
mation on demographic or clinical characteris-
tics; thus, 63,910 patients were included in the 
analysis.
Blood Pressure and Other Study Variables
Blood pressure was measured in the clinic ac-
cording to standardized procedures, with the use 
of validated oscillometric devices (in 85% of pa-
tients) or calibrated mercury sphygmomanometers 
(in 15%), after the patient had been resting in a 
seated position for 5 minutes.26-28 We used the 
mean of two clinic blood-pressure readings. 
Thereafter, ambulatory blood-pressure monitor-
ing was performed with validated, automated, 
oscillometric devices (Spacelabs model 90207, 
Spacelabs Healthcare) that were programmed to 
record blood pressure at 20-minute intervals 
during the day and at 30-minute intervals during 
the night. An appropriate cuff size (one of two 
sizes) was used for each patient. We used the 
mean of all valid readings for the analysis. Valid 
measurements had to fulfill prespecified quality 
criteria, including the successful recording of at 
least 70% of systolic and diastolic blood-pressure 
readings during the 24-hour recording period. 
Day and night periods were defined according to 
sleeping and waking times reported by the patient.
Patient data were obtained from interviews 
and physical examinations during the visits and 
from clinical records. The clinical characteristics 
of the patients were assessed in accordance with 
international guidelines.26-28 Additional details are 
provided in the Supplementary Appendix.

Clinic and Ambulatory Blood Pressure and Mortality
Mortality Data
The date and cause of death were ascertained 
from a computerized search of the vital registry 
of the Spanish National Institute of Statistics; 
evidence of the completeness, accuracy, and reli-
ability of this vital-status information has been 
made available by the Institute.29 Persons were 
designated as having died if the deaths were 
recorded in the vital registry. The cause of death 
was determined from the death certificate by a 
nosologist and was coded according to the Inter-
national Statistical Classification of Diseases, 10th Revi-
sion. We included all deaths that were classified 
as being of cardiovascular origin (codes I00 to 
I99) and further subcategorized cardiovascular-
related deaths as having been caused by ische-
mic heart disease (codes I21–I25), stroke (codes 
I60–I69), or heart failure (code I50). For each 
study participant, follow-up was from the date 
of the recruitment visit for the blood-pressure 
registry to the date of death or December 31, 
2014, whichever occurred first.
Statistical Analysis
Hypertension phenotypes in untreated patients 
were defined as white-coat hypertension (clinic 
systolic blood pressure ≥140 mm Hg or dia-
stolic ≥90 mm Hg and 24-hour systolic pres-
sure <130 mm Hg and diastolic <80 mm Hg), 
masked hypertension (clinic systolic pressure 
<140 mm Hg and diastolic <90 mm Hg and 24-
hour systolic pressure ≥130 mm Hg or diastolic 
≥80 mm Hg), sustained hypertension (clinic sys-
tolic pressure ≥140 mm Hg or diastolic ≥90 mm Hg 
and ambulatory 24-hour systolic pressure ≥130 
mm Hg or diastolic ≥80 mm Hg), or normoten-
sion (clinic systolic pressure <140 mm Hg and 
diastolic <90 mm Hg and 24-hour systolic pres-
sure <130 mm Hg and diastolic <80 mm Hg).26-28 
An explanation of the blood-pressure thresholds 
we used is provided in the Supplementary Appen-
dix. In treated patients, the corresponding terms 
were white-coat uncontrolled hypertension, 
masked uncontrolled hypertension, sustained un-
controlled hypertension, and controlled hyper-
tension, respectively.
Associations between blood pressure and mor-
tality were summarized with hazard ratios and 
95% confidence intervals, estimated with Cox 
models. Hazard ratios were calculated per 1-SD 
increment in blood pressure, and for hyperten-
sion phenotypes the reference group was untreated 
normotension. Two Cox models were construct-
ed. Model 1 was adjusted for age, sex, smoking 
status, body-mass index (the weight in kilograms 
divided by the square of the height in meters), and 
status with respect to diabetes, dyslipidemia, 
previous cardiovascular disease, and number of 
antihypertensive medications used. To assess 
whether the associations were independent of 
other blood-pressure measurements, additional 
adjustments were performed (model 2): the haz-
ard ratio for clinic blood pressure was adjusted 
for 24-hour blood pressure; 24-hour pressure was 
adjusted for clinic pressure; daytime pressure 
was adjusted for clinic and nighttime pressure; 
nighttime pressure was adjusted for clinic and 
daytime pressure; and the hazard ratios for each 
hypertension phenotype were adjusted for clinic 
pressure.
We assessed consistency in the results accord-
ing to age (<60 vs. ≥60 years), sex, body-mass 
index (<30 vs. ≥30), presence of diabetes (yes vs. 
no), previous cardiovascular disease (yes vs. no), 
and antihypertensive medication use (yes vs. no). 
We also calculated the discriminative perfor-
mance (expressed as the C statistic [area under 
the receiver-operating-characteristic curve]) and 
predictive performance (Akaike and Bayesian in-
formation criteria) of models containing blood-
pressure components.30
In addition, we calculated rate advancement 
periods31 to estimate the number of additional 
years of chronologic age that would be required 
to yield the equivalent mortality rate per 1-SD 
increase in blood pressure or for each hyperten-
sion phenotype as compared with normotension. 
Population attributable fractions32 were calcu-
lated to estimate the fraction of mortality in the 
population that could be attributed to each hyper-
tension phenotype (formulas are provided in the 
Supplementary Appendix).
Sensitivity analyses were performed in which 
persons who died in the first 2 years of follow-
up were excluded, to minimize the influence of 
reverse causation. We also checked the robust-
ness of results by defining hypertension pheno-
types on the basis of all ambulatory periods 
(24-hour, daytime, and nighttime) (see the Sup-
plementary Appendix).26-28,33,34 Finally, we tested 
the reproducibility of the main results among 
the 2811 participants who had two ambulatory 
blood-pressure measurement sessions, separated 
by a median time of 6.5 months.

as elevated clinic blood pressure (systolic ≥140 mm Hg or diastolic ≥90 mm Hg) and normal 24‑hour pressure; masked hypertension was de‑
fined as normal clinic blood pressure and elevated 24‑hour pressure (systolic ≥130 mm Hg or diastolic ≥80 mm Hg); and sustained hyperten‑
sion was defined as elevated clinic and 24‑hour blood pressures. In treated patients, the corresponding terms were controlled hypertension, 
white‑coat uncontrolled hypertension, masked uncontrolled hypertension, and sustained uncontrolled hypertension, respectively, and were 
defined with the same blood‑pressure cutoff points as those used for untreated patients.

Clinic and Ambulatory Blood Pressure and Mortality
We used SPSS software, version 19.0 (IBM), 
and R software, version 3.0.2 (R Foundation for 
Statistical Computing), for statistical analysis. 
Two-tailed P values of less than 0.05 were con-
sidered to indicate statistical significance; no 
correction for multiple testing was performed.
Results
Cohort Characteristics
The mean (±SD) age of the study participants 
was 58.4±14.2 years, 58% were men, the mean 
clinic blood pressure was 147.9/86.7 mm Hg, and 
the mean 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure was 
129.2/76.5 mm Hg (Table 1, and Fig. S1 in the 
Supplementary Appendix, which shows the full 
distribution of all blood-pressure components). 
During follow-up (median, 4.7 years), 3808 deaths 
occurred, of which 1295 were from cardiovascu-
lar causes, including 440 from ischemic heart 
disease, 291 from stroke, and 123 from heart 
failure.
Relationship of Continuous Blood-Pressure 
Variables with Mortality
Clinic and ambulatory blood-pressure measure-
ments were moderately concordant, with an intra-
class correlation coefficient of 0.57 for systolic 
pressure (P<0.001) and 0.70 for diastolic pres-
sure (P<0.001) (Fig. S2 in the Supplementary Ap-
pendix). Clinic and ambulatory blood-pressure 
measurements adjusted for cardiovascular risk 
factors were significantly associated with both 
all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, and the 
magnitude of the associations, in the case of 
both clinic and ambulatory blood pressure (es-
pecially for the systolic components), was gener-
ally similar (model 1 in Table 2). However, after

Of the 63,910 patients included in the analysis, 3808 died from any cause, and 1295 of those died from cardiovascular causes. Hazard ratios 
were estimated per 1‑SD increase of each systolic and diastolic blood‑pressure component, equivalent to approximately 19/12 mm Hg for 
clinic blood pressure or 14/10 mm Hg for ambulatory blood pressure. Rounding may have obscured small differences in hazard ratios. CI 
denotes confidence interval.
†  
Model 1 was adjusted for age, sex, smoking status, body‑mass index, and status with respect to diabetes, dyslipidemia, previous cardiovas‑
cular disease, and number of antihypertensive drugs used.
‡  
Model 2 was additionally adjusted as follows: clinic blood pressure was adjusted for 24‑hour pressure, 24‑hour blood pressure was adjusted 
for clinic pressure, daytime blood pressure was adjusted for clinic and nighttime pressures, and nighttime blood pressure was adjusted for 
clinic and daytime pressures.

tality, 1.54 before adjustment and 1.02 after ad-
justment); conversely, the hazard ratio for 24-hour 
ambulatory systolic pressure did not change 
markedly after adjustment for clinic blood pres-
sure (hazard ratio for all-cause mortality, 1.58 
before adjustment and 1.58 after adjustment) 
(model 2 in Table 2).
Most results were similar in analyses strati-
fied according to age, sex, and status with re-
spect to obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, 
antihypertensive medication use, the number of 
antihypertensive drugs used, and the use of spe-
cific antihypertensive drug classes (Fig. S3 and 
Tables S1 and S2 in the Supplementary Appen-
dix). Figure 1 shows that the risk of death in-
creased as all clinic and ambulatory blood-
pressure components increased. With regard to 
cause-specific cardiovascular mortality, 24-hour 
systolic pressure showed a stronger association 
with ischemic heart disease, stroke, and heart 
failure than clinic systolic pressure (Table S3 in 
the Supplementary Appendix).
Mortality Discrimination and Predictive 
Performance
In a model that included age, sex, and status with 
respect to cardiovascular risk factors (model 1), 
the addition of ambulatory systolic pressure re-
sulted in a model with better mortality discrim-
ination (C statistic for model, 0.94) than the 
addition of clinic systolic pressure (C statistic for 
model, 0.79). Predictive performance was also 
better for the model that included ambulatory 
pressure (lower values for the Akaike and Bayesian 
information criteria) (model 1 in Table S4 in the 
Supplementary Appendix). Also, when 24-hour 
blood pressure was added to the clinic blood-
pressure models (model 2), the discriminative 
and predictive performance improved for the 
relationship between systolic pressure and all-
cause mortality (C statistic for model 1, 0.79; 
C statistic for model 2, 0.94; P 
= 
0.002). However, 
with the converse adjustment (clinic blood pres-
sure added to the 24-hour ambulatory blood-
pressure model), there was only a minor change 
in discrimination (C statistic for model 1, 0.94; 
C statistic for model 2, 0.94; P 
= 
0.93). For dia-
stolic blood pressure, and for overall cardiovas-
cular mortality, there was less evidence of an 
incremental improvement in discrimination with 
the addition of 24-hour ambulatory blood pres-
sure to the clinic blood-pressure models.
Relationship of Hypertension Phenotypes 
with Mortality
Of all the hypertension phenotypes evaluated, 
masked hypertension was associated with the 
highest risk and showed a stronger association 
with all-cause mortality (hazard ratio, 2.83) than 
sustained hypertension (hazard ratio, 1.80) or 
white-coat hypertension (hazard ratio, 1.79) when 
adjusted for clinic blood pressure (Table 3). 
Similar findings were noted for cardiovascular 
mortality. Results for treated patients were sim-
ilar to those for untreated patients, except that 
the results for white-coat uncontrolled hyperten-
sion did not reach statistical significance (model 2 
in Table 3). Cumulative mortality curves illus-
trate that, after full adjustment, masked hyper-
tension was the strongest predictor of risk, fol-
lowed by masked uncontrolled hypertension 
(Fig. S4 in the Supplementary Appendix). Most 
results were similar in analyses stratified accord-
ing to age, sex, and status with respect to obe-
sity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease (Fig. S5 
in the Supplementary Appendix). Finally, when 
the group with masked uncontrolled hyperten-
sion was compared with the group with con-
trolled hypertension, fully adjusted hazard ratios 
were 2.61 (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.14 to 
3.17) for all-cause mortality and 2.48 (95% CI, 
1.83 to 3.37) for cardiovascular mortality.
Additional Analyses
The rate advancement period for all-cause mor-
tality was 1.4 years per 1-SD increase in clinic 
systolic blood pressure and increased to 8.5 to 
10.2 years per 1-SD increase in ambulatory sys-
tolic blood pressures (Table 4). Of all the hyper-
tension phenotypes, masked hypertension had the 
greatest rate advancement periods as compared 
with normotension. Rate advancement periods 
for treated patients were somewhat smaller. The 
values were generally similar for cardiovascular 
mortality.
Regarding population attributable fractions, 
sustained hypertension (observed in 15.6% of 
the patients who died) and masked hypertension 
(in 3.0% of the patients who died) accounted for 
7.0% and 1.9%, respectively, of deaths from any 
cause that occurred in the whole cohort. Among

Clinic and Ambulatory Blood Pressure and Mortality
Figure 1. Five-Year Risk of Death Associated with Systolic and Diastolic Blood Pressures, across Blood-Pressure Values.
The risk of death was calculated per 10 mm Hg increments in clinic systolic blood pressure (systolic blood pressure measured in the clinic) and ambulatory systolic blood pressure and 5 mm 
Hg increments in clinic and ambulatory diastolic blood pressure. Data were adjusted for age, sex, smoking status, body‑mass index, and status with respect to diabetes, dyslipidemia, previ‑
ous cardiovascular disease, and the number of antihypertensive drugs used. In addition, clinic blood pressure was adjusted for 24‑hour blood pressure, 24‑hour blood pressure was adjusted 
for clinic blood pressure, daytime blood pressure was adjusted for clinic and nighttime blood pressures, and nighttime blood pressure was adjusted for clinic and daytime blood pressures.

The new engl and jour nal of medicine
treated patients (those with uncontrolled sus-
tained or masked hypertension), the population 
attributable fractions nearly doubled. Population 
attributable fractions were similar for cardio-
vascular mortality. Among all treated patients 
with controlled clinic blood pressure (patients with 
controlled hypertension plus those with masked 
uncontrolled hypertension), those with masked 
uncontrolled hypertension (i.e., normal clinic 
blood pressure but elevated 24-hour blood pres-
sure, observed in 54.0% of the patients in this 
subgroup who died) accounted for a population 
attributable fraction of 33.3% (Table 4).
Sensitivity and reproducibility analyses were 
consistent with the primary findings. These 
analyses are described in the Supplementary 
Appendix.
Discussion
In this large cohort study, ambulatory systolic 
blood pressure was a stronger predictor of all-
cause and cardiovascular mortality than clinic 
systolic pressure. We also found that masked 
hypertension had strong associations with all-
cause and cardiovascular mortality, although the

Hazard ratios were estimated for each blood‑pressure phenotype, with normotension as reference. Hypertension phenotypes were defined in 
untreated patients as follows: normotension was normal clinic blood pressure (systolic <140 mm Hg and diastolic <90 mm Hg) and normal 
24‑hour pressure (systolic <130 mm Hg and diastolic <80 mm Hg); white‑coat hypertension was defined as elevated clinic blood pressure 
(systolic ≥140 mm Hg or diastolic ≥90 mm Hg) and normal 24‑hour pressure; masked hypertension was defined as normal clinic blood 
pressure and elevated 24‑hour pressure (systolic ≥130 mm Hg or diastolic ≥80 mm Hg); and sustained hypertension was defined as elevat‑
ed clinic and 24‑hour blood pressures. In treated patients, the corresponding terms were controlled hypertension, white‑coat uncontrolled 
hypertension, masked uncontrolled hypertension, and sustained uncontrolled hypertension, respectively, and were defined with the same 
blood‑pressure cutoff points as those used for untreated patients.

Model 1 was adjusted for age, sex, smoking status, body‑mass index, and status with respect to diabetes, dyslipidemia, previous cardiovas‑

Clinic and Ambulatory Blood Pressure and Mortality
population attributable fraction was greater for 
sustained hypertension, which is more common 
than masked hypertension.
Previous population and clinical studies have 
shown that ambulatory blood pressure predicts 
cardiovascular events better than clinic blood 
pressure.4,5,7-10 Our large study corroborated these 
findings. A model that included clinic blood 
pressure as well as age, sex, and status with 
respect to cardiovascular risk factors (model 1) 
was a reasonably good discriminator of cardio-
vascular mortality (C statistic for model, 0.91)

The new engl and jour nal of medicine
but was not as good a discriminator of all-cause 
mortality (C statistic for model, 0.79), probably 
because the C statistic measures the discrimina-
tion ability of all the variables in model 1, includ-
ing the cardiovascular risk factors, which have 
greater influence on cardiovascular mortality 
than on all-cause mortality. Indeed, the improve-
ment in discrimination with the addition of 24-
hour systolic pressure (model 2) for all-cause but 
not for cardiovascular mortality is probably be-
cause the C statistic for model 1 was already 
quite high for cardiovascular mortality. The as-
sociation of 24-hour systolic blood pressure with 
all-cause and cardiovascular mortality was simi-
lar to that seen for daytime systolic pressure and 
nighttime systolic pressure and remained sig-
nificant in multivariate adjustment that included 
clinic blood pressure. These findings were con-
sistent in subgroups defined according to age, sex, 
the presence or absence of obesity, and status 
with respect to diabetes, previous cardiovascular 
disease, and antihypertensive drug treatment.
In our study, unlike most previous stud-
ies,2,14-18,35 we observed consistently greater mor-
tality associated with masked hypertension than 
with sustained hypertension, which might be due 
to the delayed detection of masked hypertension 
in patients, who consequently could have more 
organ damage and cardiovascular disease than 
patients with sustained hypertension. In previous 
research, white-coat hypertension showed a risk 
similar to that of normotension,14,16,18-22 or an 
intermediate risk between normotension and 
hypertension.15,36-39 In our study, white-coat hyper-
tension was not benign, which may be due in 
part to the higher mean blood pressure over 24 
hours in these patients (119.9/71.9 mm Hg, vs. 
116.6/70.6 mm Hg in normotensive patients; 
P<0.001) or to their metabolic phenotype.2,39 The 
somewhat weaker association with mortality of 
treated phenotypes than of untreated phenotypes 
is probably because treated patients were more 
likely to have frequent follow-up visits, repeated 
blood-pressure checks, medication adjustments, 
and treatment of concomitant conditions con-
tributing to risk.
Masked uncontrolled hypertension was associ-
ated with high mortality in the subpopulation of 
patients with treated hypertension and controlled 
clinic blood pressure who died (population attrib-
utable fraction, 33.3%) but much lower mortality 
in the whole cohort who died (population attrib-
utable fraction, 3.0%), mainly because the per-
centage of persons with masked uncontrolled 
hypertension was much higher in the first than 
in the second population (54.0% vs. 6.2%). Rate 
advancement periods can highlight the clinical 
implications of the data by showing, for exam-
ple, that on average, a 50-year-old patient with 
masked uncontrolled hypertension, as compared 
with a normotensive person, had an all-cause 
mortality rate equivalent to being 14 years older.
This study has some limitations. First, clinic 
blood pressure represented the average of only 
two readings at each clinic visit; thus, the mean 
clinic pressure could be overestimated because it 
tends to become lower with repeated measure-
ments. Nevertheless, this is a pragmatic study of 
real-world clinical practice where this approach 
to clinic blood-pressure measurement is more 
typical than that adopted in clinical trials. Like-
wise, in most patients, ambulatory blood-pres-
sure monitoring was performed at a single time 
point, thus limiting its prognostic power. Never-
theless, hazard ratios in the reproducibility 
analyses (among participants who had two am-
bulatory blood-pressure measurement sessions) 
were generally similar for each blood-pressure 
component in the two ambulatory monitoring 
sessions in all participants. Second, we have no 
data on medication during the follow-up period 
except in patients who had two ambulatory 
blood-pressure monitoring sessions; in these 
patients, the main study associations did not 
vary according to the number of medications 
received (Table S8 in the Supplementary Appen-
dix). Third, there may be some selection bias 
from inclusion criteria for ambulatory blood-
pressure monitoring. However, the participants 
with hypertension in our registry have a cardio-
vascular risk profile similar to that of patients 
with hypertension in other studies that are rep-
resentative of primary care.40 Fourth, this is an 
observational study on the prognostic value of 
blood-pressure monitoring and, thus, no direct 
inference can be made regarding the benefit of 
basing treatment on ambulatory blood-pressure 
measurements. Finally, we studied a white popu-
lation, and the results may not apply to people 
of other races.
In conclusion, in this large study, 24-hour, 
daytime, and nighttime ambulatory systolic blood

pressures were all better predictors of all-cause 
and cardiovascular mortality than clinic blood 
pressure. Sustained hypertension, white-coat 
hypertension, and masked hypertension were all 
associated with an increased risk of death; the 
strongest association was found with masked 
hypertension.
