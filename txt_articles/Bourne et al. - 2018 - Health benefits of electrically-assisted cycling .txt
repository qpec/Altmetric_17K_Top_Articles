Abstract
Background: Electrically assisted bicycles (e-bikes) have been highlighted as a method of active travel that could
overcome some of the commonly reported barriers to cycle commuting. The objective of this systematic review
was to assess the health benefits associated with e-cycling.
Method: A systematic literature review of studies examining physical activity, cardiorespiratory, metabolic and
psychological outcomes associated with e-cycling. Where possible these outcomes were compared to those from
conventional cycling and walking. Seven electronic databases, clinical trial registers, grey literature and reference
lists were searched up to November 2017. Hand searching occurred until June 2018. Experimental or observational
studies examining the impact of e-cycling on physical activity and/or health outcomes of interest were included. E-
bikes used must have pedals and require pedalling for electric assistance to be provided.
Results: Seventeen studies (11 acute experiments, 6 longitudinal interventions) were identified involving a total of
300 participants. There was moderate evidence that e-cycling provided physical activity of at least moderate
intensity, which was lower than the intensity elicited during conventional cycling, but higher than that during
walking. There was also moderate evidence that e-cycling can improve cardiorespiratory fitness in physically
inactive individuals. Evidence of the impact of e-cycling on metabolic and psychological health outcomes was
inconclusive. Longitudinal evidence was compromised by weak study design and quality.
Conclusion: E-cycling can contribute to meeting physical activity recommendations and increasing physical fitness.
As such, e-bikes offer a potential alternative to conventional cycling. Future research should examine the long-term
health impacts of e-cycling using rigorous research designs.

Background
Given the high rates of global physical inactivity [1] a grow-
ing body of research has focused on the potential of active
travel to increase physical activity behaviour and potentially
lead to population health benefits. Engagement in active
travel, specifically commuting, has been shown to be pre-
dictive of a lower BMI [2] and reduced risk of diabetes diag-
nosis [3]. A recent prospective study reported that active
commuting, involving cycling, was associated with a lower
risk of all-cause mortality and cancer incidence and mortal-
ity [4]. In addition, commuting by bicycle or on foot was
associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular disease inci-
dence and mortality [4]. The greatest gains in health out-
comes from active commuting are reported in the least
active individuals [5, 6].
Travel is an essential part of everyday life for most
people, and the adoption of active travel represents an effi-
cient way to increase daily physical activity. For example,
Falconer and colleagues [2] found that active commuting
was associated with an additional 73 weekly minutes of
moderate to vigorous physical activity in men and 105
weekly minutes in women with type 2 diabetes, compared
to those commuting using motorised transport. With half
of all car journeys in the UK being between 1 and 5 miles
in length [7], the substitution of many car journeys by
walking and/or cycling may be an achievable aim.

 Due to a growing body of evidence, the UK National In-
stitute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) now endorse
active travel, with a particular focus on commuting, as a
feasible method to incorporate physical activity into daily
life [8]. However, rates of active commuting are low
[9].Common barriers to cycle commuting include the phys-
ical constraints associated with hilly terrain, poor physical
fitness, lack of time and the distance to work [10].
Electrically assisted bicycles (e-bikes) have been highlighted
as an alternative method of active travel that could overcome
some of the commonly reported barriers to cycle commuting
[11]. The term e-bike includes a range of designs including
throttle-controlled bikes which do not require the rider to
pedal and electrically assisted bikes which provide electrical
assistance only when the rider is pedalling, through sensors
which detect pedalling speed and force [11]. It is through
pedalling that electrically-assisted cycling may serve to in-
crease physical activity. With lower motor power and max-
imum speeds compared to throttle-controlled e-bikes,
electrically-assisted bikes are legally classified as bicycles.
[11]. For this review the term e-bike will be used exclusively
to refer to electrically-assisted bicycles which require the
rider to pedal.
In recent years e-bikes have become commonplace in Euro-
pean countries [11] with projected global sales of 47.6 million
by the end of 2018 [12]. E-bikes are increasingly used for both
leisure and commuting purposes [13]. The assistance provided
has been reported to motivate novice cyclists and increase the
likelihood that these individuals will continue to cycle in the fu-
ture [10]. Given the increasing interest in e-bikes, and their use
for active travel, there is a need to understand their potential to
promote physical activity of a sufficient intensity to gain clinical
benefit (i.e., moderate-to-vigorous intensity [14]) and to exam-
ine their impact on broader health outcomes. Such research is
required to inform relevant health economic assessments and
public health policy. To date, there has been no systematic re-
view on the physical activity intensity and health outcomes as-
sociated with e-cycling. As such the aims of this systematic
review are to answer the following research questions:
1. What is the intensity of physical activity associated
with riding an e-bike?
2. Does use of an e-bike lead to changes in health out-
comes including cardiorespiratory, metabolic or
psychological outcomes?
3. Do physiological responses to riding an e-bike differ
to those generated by other modes of active trans-
portation (i.e. walking and conventional cycling)?
Methods
A review protocol was registered at the PROSPERO database:
Registration number CRD42018086544 (http://www.crd.york.a-
c.uk/prospero). This review was conducted according to the
guidelines outlined by the Preferred Reporting Items for Sys-
tematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines [15].
Search strategy
The following databases were searched from their inception
to November 2017: PsychINFO, MEDLINE and Embase (via
Ovid), ISI Web of Science, CINAHL complete, SPORTDiscus
and Scopus. Search terms were ‘pedelec’
, ‘e-bike’
, ‘electrically
assisted bicycle’
, ‘electrically assisted cycle’
, ‘electrically assisted
bike’
,‘pedal-assist’
,‘electric bicycle’
,‘electric bike’
,‘electric cycle’
,‘elec-
tric mobility’ (see Additional file 1 for example). Reference lists
from all selected articles were hand-searched for relevant stud-
ies. OpenGrey and Google Scholar (first 20-pages) were
searched
using
the
term
‘electrically-assisted
bicycle’.
Hand-searching occurred until June 2018.
Inclusion criteria and selection process
Studies were eligible for inclusion if they met the follow-
ing criteria:
1) participants: adults ≥18 years of age,
2) electrically-assisted bicycle must have pedals and be
operated by the individual, with assistance available
from an electric motor
3) at least one of the following outcomes; objective
measure of physical activity intensity whilst e-
cycling (e.g., metabolic equivalents, energy expend-
iture), cardiorespiratory, metabolic or quality of life
(as a measure of psychological health),
4) type of study: experimental or observational studies.
Studies could be published or unpublished in any lan-
guage. For articles in a language other than English the title
and abstract were translated using Google Translate. If full
text screening was required, the article was translated by an
individual fluent in the language. Studies were excluded if
they reported using bicycles that did not require the individ-
ual to pedal to provide power, were review articles or com-
mentary pieces, and/or used self-reported measures of
physical activity. Title and abstract screening was conducted
by two reviewers independently (J.E.B. and S.S.). There was a
93% agreement between reviewers on title and abstract
screening. Full texts were screened by the two reviewers in-
dependently and any discrepancies were discussed.
Quality assessment and strength of the evidence
The quality of included studies was assessed using the
Quality Assessment Tool for Quantitative Studies (EPHPP;
[16]). The tool appraises studies on six components; 1) se-
lection bias, 2) study design, 3) control of confounders, 4)
blinding, 5) reliability and validity of data collection
methods and 6) withdrawals and dropouts. Each compo-
nent was rated as; strong, moderate or weak for each study
based on outcomes of interest.
Bourne et al. International Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity          (2018) 15:116 
Page 2 of 15
 A global rating for each study was then determined
based on the criteria; 1) strong when no weak ratings were
reported, 2) moderate when one weak rating was reported,
and 3) weak when two or more components were rated as
weak. This tool has been used in a previous review exam-
ining the impact of cycling on health [6]. The blinding
component was not included in the overall study rating as
participants are unable to be blinded to condition alloca-
tion following randomisation in physical activity interven-
tions. The overall strength of the evidence was assessed
based on previously specified best evidence synthesis cri-
teria [17] (Additional file 2).
Data extraction and synthesis
Members of the review team (J.E.B and either S.S. or
A.R.C) independently extracted data for each study.
Quality assessment was confirmed by a fourth reviewer
(R.P.). Data were extracted using an adapted version of a
Cochrane Data Extraction Form, which was piloted prior to
use. Discrepancies regarding data extraction were resolved
through discussion between reviewers. Data extracted
included
study
design,
characteristics
of
participants,
outcomes measured, and results. Due to the heterogeneity
of study design and outcomes reported, a meta-analysis
was not deemed appropriate. Data were synthesized and
presented narratively. The effect of the intervention on
physical activity and health outcomes for each study was
summarized based on reported statistical significance and
effect size, both within group (pre-post) and between group
where possible, or by examining means or medians when
no hypothesis testing was conducted.
Results
A total of 4399 articles were identified through initial
searches (Fig. 1). After removing duplicates 2894 titles
and abstracts were screened, resulting in 119 studies
which
underwent full
text
screening
for inclusion.
Sixteen articles met the criteria for inclusion plus one
included after author contact. Eleven studies assessed the
acute response to e-cycling (i.e., one bout of e-cycling),
and six examined the longitudinal effect of e-cycling (i.e.,
more than one bout of e-cycling, including pre-post mea-
surements). Reasons for exclusion included no measure of
specified outcomes, study not related to e-bikes, studies
focused on the engineering of e-bikes, qualitative studies
or not presenting original research. Three studies were
identified through clinicaltrials.gov but were excluded for
the following reasons: 1) data not published, 2) currently
recruiting, 3) authors were not reachable.
Study characteristics
Acute studies
Eleven studies examined the acute physiological impact
of e-cycling using cross over designs, five of which were
randomized (Table 1). Nine studies were conducted in
Europe and two in the USA. Sample sizes ranged from 3
to 22 with a total of 147 participants. Participants were
aged between 20 and 70. Three studies recruited physic-
ally inactive individuals [18–20] and one study included in-
dividuals with coronary artery disease [21]. Six studies
compared e-cycling to conventional cycling [18, 21–25]
and five compared e-cycling with assist to riding an e-bike
without assistance [19, 20, 26–28]. Two studies included
walking as a comparator [18, 23].
Rest periods between conditions ranged from 2-min to 1
month and distance ridden from 3.54 to 27 km. Nine stud-
ies were conducted in a natural setting with topography
ranging from flat to elevations between 33.5 and 260 m.
Four studies specifically examined the impact of topog-
raphy on physiological outcomes by separating rides into
different topographical sections (Additional file 3). Four
studies required participants to stop and go during rides to
simulate typical riding conditions [20, 26] or delivering mail
[24, 25]. In seven studies participants were instructed to
ride at a self-selected pace.
Longitudinal studies
Six
studies
examined
the
longitudinal
impact
of
e-cycling, using a variety of study designs (Table 1).
All studies were conducted in high income countries
including Belgium, Switzerland, Norway, UK (n = 2)
and the USA. Sample sizes ranged from 20 to 32,
with a total of 153 participants. Most participants
were between 30 and 50 years of age. Four studies
recruited physically inactive individuals [13, 29–31].
One study included individuals with type 2 diabetes
[32] and for one study the health status of individ-
uals was unclear [33]. Interventions ranged from
4-weeks to 8-months in length. One study included
published data from mid-point of the intervention,
but not post intervention [33]. Three studies pro-
vided participants with guidelines on minimum rid-
ing requirements, all of which specified riding the
e-bike for commuting purposes at least three times
per week [13, 29, 30].
Physical activity intensity
Studies reported a range of outcomes related to
physical activity intensity. Given the heterogeneity
between studies regarding route length and topog-
raphy, mean values and/or percent of maximum
values
during
conditions
are
reported
to
enable
comparison between studies. Physiological outcomes
reported within the manuscript include oxygen up-
take, metabolic equivalents,1 energy expenditure per
minute, heart rate and power output (Table 2).
Additional outcomes are reported in Additional file
4 and Additional file 5.

 Oxygen uptake
Eight studies reported oxygen uptake [18, 19, 21–23,
25–27]. Riding an e-bike led to a relative mean oxy-
gen uptake of 14.7 to 29 ml/min/kg or 51 to 74% of
maximum oxygen uptake. E-cycling required lower
oxygen uptake than conventional cycling (19.3 to 37
ml/min/kg) or e-cycling with no assistance (22.9 to
23.4 ml/min/kg), with statistically significant differ-
ences reported in four studies, one of which re-
ported an effect size of 1.73 [19]. Walking elicited
lower
oxygen
uptake
compared
to
self-selected
e-cycling [23] and e-cycling on low assist [18].
Metabolic equivalents (METs)
Nine studies reported mean estimated METs while
riding an e-bike at a self-selected intensity [13, 18–
23, 26, 27], which ranged from 4.9 to 8.3 METs.
Overall, e-cycling led to a lower mean MET score
than conventional cycling or e-cycling without assist-
ance. However, the significance of the difference is
inconclusive.
One
study
reported
a
difference
in
mean METs between walking and e-cycling only dur-
ing uphill sections [23], while another study reported
no difference between walking and e-cycling over
varied terrain [18].

 Energy expenditure per minute
Four studies assessed energy expenditure per minute
[13, 23, 24, 27]. On an indoor trainer, energy ex-
penditure per minute was lower on an e-bike with
assistance (high or low) compared to an e-bike with-
out assistance in physically active adults [27]. In out-
door trials two studies reported no difference in
energy expenditure per minute between e-cycling
and conventional cycling, though mean values were
consistently lower for e-cycling [23, 24]. Absolute
energy
expenditure
per
minute
while
riding
an
e-bike ranged from 4.9 to 6.5 kcal/min.
Heart rate
Twelve studies reported heart rate while e-cycling [13,
18–20, 23–28, 30, 32]. During e-cycling the percentage
of maximum heart rate ranged from 67.1 to 79.1. Over-
all, mean heart rate while riding an e-bike was lower
than riding a conventional bike or an e-bike with no

 assistance. Heart rate showed a trend towards being
lower while walking compared to e-cycling [18, 23, 32].
Power output
Five studies assessed power output during conditions
[19, 20, 23, 26, 27]. Mean power output was lower while
riding an e-bike compared to a conventional bike or
e-cycling with no assistance. Riding an e-bike on high
assistance compared to low assistance led to significantly
lower power outputs.
Overall, e-cycling was performed at a moderate intensity,
but the intensity was lower than during conventional cycling.
Most studies reported significant differences in the associ-
ated outcomes between e-cycling and conventional cycling.
However, one study found no differences in physiological
markers of intensity between e-cycling and conventional cyc-
ling [26]. While the evidence is limited, e-cycling appears to
be performed at a greater intensity than walking.
Impact of topography
Five studies directly compared the impact of e-cycling in
varying topographies (Additional file 3). The energy cost
during e-cycling and conventional cycling uphill ranged
from 5.2 to 6.8 and 7.2 to 8.5 METs respectively. This dif-
ference was statistically significant in the three studies that
conducted hypothesis testing. Examination of means and
medians suggested that energy expenditure (METs) during
downhill and flat sections were lower while e-cycling com-
pared to conventional cycling, but that this difference in en-
ergy cost was less distinct than during uphill sections.
Across all studies, greater elevation gains in routes led to
higher energy cost for both e-cycling and conventional cyc-
ling compared to flat routes or those conducted indoors.
Differences in heart rate between e-cycling and conven-
tional cycling appear to be greater during uphill sections,
except for one study [19] that reported similar differences
in
heart
rate
between
cycling
conditions
across
all
topographies.
Physical fitness
A pilot randomized control trial of physically inactive individ-
uals reported an increase in peak oxygen uptake (VO2peak) of
10% following 4-weeks of e-cycling compared to a 6% increase
following 4-weeks of conventional cycling [30] (Table 3). In a
similar population, using a single-group quasi-experimental
design, one study reported an 8% increase in VO2peak follow-
ing 4-weeks of e-cyling [13] and another reported a 7.7% in-
crease in VO2peak following 3-months of e-cycling [31]. When
separated into low and high fitness groups a significant in-
crease in VO2peak was reported only in individuals with low
levels of fitness, with a 9.6% increase compared to a 1.5% in-
crease in high fitness individuals [31]. Gender differences were
reported in one study following 6-weeks of e-cycling with a 2
and 7% increase in VO2peak in physically inactive men and
women respectively [29]. Gender differences were also re-
ported in maximum power output with women reporting
lower increases in maximum power than men following a
6-week and 5-month intervention [29, 32].
Health outcomes
Three studies examined the impact of e-cycling on health out-
comes beyond fitness (Table 3), for which the outcomes
assessed were heterogeneous. After 4-weeks of e-cycling there
were no changes in systolic or diastolic blood pressure at rest
[13, 30]. There was no evidence of a difference in blood pres-
sure whilst cycling between conventional cycling and e-cycling
[30]. Peterman and colleagues [13] reported no changes in in-
sulin resistance or lipid profiles following 4-weeks of e-cycling.
However, a significant reduction in 2-h post plasma glucose
concentration was reported. No changes were reported in the
one study examining quality of life following 8 weeks of
e-cycling [33].
Quality assessment and quality of the evidence
The global rating of acute studies yielded six moderate and
five weak ratings according to the EPHPP tool (Table 4). Ten
studies were rated as weak for representativeness of the target
population, often due to a failure to report how participants
were recruited. Methods of assessment were rated as strong.
The repeated nature of conditions ensured the control of con-
founders, therefore yielding a strong rating. Overall there was
moderate evidence that e-cycling could lead to physical activ-
ity at an intensity associated with beneficial health outcomes
[14]. A global rating of strong was given to one longitudinal
study, moderate was given to four studies and weak to one
study. There was moderate evidence that e-cycling could lead
to increased fitness. The evidence related to the impact of
e-cycling on additional health outcomes was inconclusive.
Discussion
The aim of the current review was to assess the intensity
of physical activity when riding an e-bike, and to exam-
ine the physiological and psychological outcomes associ-
ated with e-cycling. Where possible these outcomes
were compared to traditional methods of active travel
(i.e., walking and cycling). Eleven acute and six longitu-
dinal studies were identified. There was moderate evi-
dence
that
e-cycling
provides
moderate
intensity
physical activity in both physically active and inactive in-
dividuals. Furthermore, there was moderate evidence
that e-cycling positively impacted cardiorespiratory fit-
ness in physically inactive individuals. The impact of
e-cycling on health outcomes beyond physical fitness
was inconclusive given the sparsity of current research.
Quality of the evidence
The quality of all studies, bar one [30], was weak to
moderate. These ratings should be viewed with caution

 as the purpose of physiological studies, such as the acute
experiments reported here, is to explore a specific event
in a controlled environment with less focus on obtaining
representative samples. As such, many studies did not re-
port how participants were recruited, leading to a weak rating
for the selection bias component of the assessment. Study de-
sign, control of confounders and methods of assessment are
often considered more crucial in these designs, all of which
were strong in the acute studies reported here. Furthermore,
while blinding is often unachievable in physical activity inter-
ventions, the use of objective methodology limits the impact
of research bias on the outcomes.
Regarding longitudinal studies, methods of data collection
were consistently strong, but with large variation in representa-
tiveness, design and reporting of withdrawals and dropouts.
Confounders were considered in the context of differences be-
tween groups and were therefore rated as strong if studies used
a single-group design. One pilot randomized control trial was
conducted and was rated as strong [30]. Overall, there was a
lack of high-quality longitudinal intervention-based research in-
cluding pre-post measures examining the impact of e-cycling
on physiological and psychological health outcomes.
The impact of e-cycling on physical activity intensity
To accrue health benefits, The American College of Sports
Medicine
recommend
healthy
adults
engage
in
moderate-to-vigorous physical activity for 150-min per
week [14]. Moderate intensity activity is classified as three
to six metabolic equivalents (METs) and vigorous intensity
activity at six METs or above. The current review suggests
that e-cycling, even while using a high assistance mode,
provides physical activity of at least moderate intensity on a
variety
of
terrain,
including
downhill.
Furthermore,
e-cycling can elicit vigorous activity during uphill riding
[18] and during rides with highly varied terrain [18, 26].
Interestingly, Bernsten and colleagues [22] reported that
mean estimated METs were lower than mean measured
METs during e-cycling. Estimated METs have been sug-
gested to overestimate resting energy expenditure, thereby
underestimating activity energy expenditure [34]. As such,
the mean estimated METs reported in this review provide a
conservative estimate of exercise intensity.
Relative physiological outcomes further suggest that
e-cycling is performed at a moderate intensity with the
percent of maximum heart rate ranging from 67.1 to
79.1 and the percent of VO2peak/max ranging from 51 to
75. These values exceed the hypothesised minimum in-
tensity thresholds required for improvements in cardio-
respiratory fitness in healthy adults [14, 35, 36].
E-cycling vs. traditional active transportation
Three studies compared e-cycling to walking [18, 23, 32]
of which one compared the two modes on the same
route [23]. In this study walking led to lower oxygen
uptake than e-cycling across all topographies, though
significant MET differences were only reported during
uphill sections, with e-cycling expending more energy
than walking. The few studies conducted suggest e-cycling
is performed at a higher intensity than walking, however,
more studies are needed to confirm these trends.
In relation to conventional cycling, this review suggests
that e-cycling elicits lower physiological markers of inten-
sity than conventional cycling, however the strength of this
finding depends on the physiological assessment measure
and route topography. Overall, mean percent of VO2max/
peak is similar between conventional cycling and e-cycling
ranging from 58 to 74% and 51 to 73% respectively. Studies
examining active commuting on conventional bikes have
reported similar mean percent of VO2max in healthy adults
ranging from 57 to 79% [6, 37]. However, mean relative
oxygen uptake is lower during e-cycling compared to con-
ventional cycling or e-cycling without assistance. Similarly,
means and medians of estimated METs are consistently
higher during conventional cycling or e-cycling without as-
sistance compared to assisted e-cycling, with values ranging
from 6.1 to 8.5 and 4.9 to 8.3 respectively, though the sig-
nificance of the differences varied across studies.
La Salle and colleagues [26] reported similar MET
values between e-cycling and conventional cycling. How-
ever, the values reported were substantially higher than
those reported in other studies, with mean estimated
METs of 8.3 and 8.5 for e-cycling and conventional cyc-
ling respectively. Participant demographics may have
accounted for these differences, since participants were
younger and had previous cycling experience. These par-
ticipants may have had higher aerobic capacity and
therefore self-selected a higher intensity activity level at
which to complete the conditions. This is likely given
that the relative intensity of activity is similar in studies
of e-cycling in physically inactive individuals [13, 18–20,
30, 32]. When given the choice to self-select pace and
intensity individuals may select a similar physiological
intensity across activities regardless of the mechanical
assistance, thereby resulting in similar physiological out-
comes. In support of this, when individuals were re-
quired to maintain a cycling cadence of 60 revolutions
per minute throughout a condition, there were signifi-
cant differences in oxygen uptake and heart rate between
e-bikes and conventional bikes [18] compared to studies
in which individuals were able to self-selected their inten-
sity [21, 22, 26]. Similarly, when instructed to complete
60-meters of riding in 10-sec for a total of 30-min the
reported relative VO2max was 29 ml/min/kg for e-cycling
and 37 ml/min/kg for conventional cycling [25]. This
suggests that performing the same amount of work
requires more effort on a conventional bike than an
e-bike, but that human beings reduce the amount of work
conducted on a conventional bike, through choosing a
Bourne et al. International Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity          (2018) 15:116 
Page 12 of 15
 slower speed, to account for the increase in expended
effort.
In hilly terrain, where there is less opportunity to adjust ef-
fort levels to produce comparable intensity levels, the differ-
ences between conventional cycling and e-cycling may
become more pronounced, with e-cycling requiring lower in-
tensity activity, as found in studies comprised of routes with
hilly features [18, 23]. This suggests that e-bikes are less sen-
sitive to environmental factors such as topography. There-
fore, physiological measures of intensity are lower on the
e-bike than those reported on a conventional bike during up-
hill riding. The reduced intensity required during uphill rid-
ing when using an e-bike is one of the leading arguments for
the promotion of e-bikes as an alternative mode of active
transportation.
E-cycling and health
In the current review three studies provided weekly
e-cycling goals for physically inactive individuals in the
context of active commuting [13, 29, 30]. Two of these
studies reported increases in VO2peak and maximum
power output following 4-weeks of e-cycling [13, 30]. In
contrast de Geus and colleagues [10] reported no changes
in VO2peak following a 6-week intervention, though differ-
ences in maximum power output were seen. Differences
between studies could be due to distance cycled. Specific-
ally, both Hochsmann [30] and Peterman and colleagues
[13] reported cycling distances of 70 km and 69.4 km per
week respectively, compared to 54.3 km per week reported
by de Geus [10]. The two studies reporting significant in-
creases in fitness also described self-selected riding inten-
sities of between 72.1 and 74.9% of maximum heart rate
(within the moderate intensity zone [13, 30] with an aver-
age of 205 min (±43.3) of e-cycling per week [13]. This
suggests that e-cycling can contribute to meeting weekly
physical activity guidelines.
Without the provision of e-cycling goals, single group
studies with physically inactive individuals reported in-
creases in maximal power output of 7 to 10% over 3–8
months, despite lower average distance travelled than
other studies [31, 32]. Fitness benefits were greatest in in-
dividuals classified as having low fitness [31], similar to
findings with conventional cycling [6]. These results sug-
gest that in the absence of specific goals (i.e., under free
living conditions), participants engage in e-cycling and this
e-cycling can contribute to improvements in fitness.
Beyond cardiorespiratory fitness, there is a lack of research
examining the impact of e-cycling on physiological or psycho-
logical health outcomes, limiting our ability to draw conclu-
sions. Peterman and colleagues [13] reported a decrease in
2-h plasma glucose during an oral glucose tolerance test after
4-weeks of e-cycling. This finding is in line with studies that
have examined the impact of exercise on 2-h post exercise
glucose concentrations in obese individuals [38, 39] but is
novel in the context of e-cycling and conventional cycling. In
the same study, no other metabolic changes were reported.
Similar null effects on metabolic outcomes were reported in
two systematic reviews on conventional cycling [37, 40].
E-cycling for public health?
Overall e-cycling can elicit at least moderate intensity phys-
ical activity. However, total energy expenditure when riding
an e-bike is lower than when riding a conventional bike or
walking over the same distance, given the reduced amount
of time taken to complete a ride on an e-bike. Consequently,
if e-cycling were to replace journeys made by walking or
conventional cycling, individuals would have to ride for lon-
ger for comparable weekly energy expenditure. However,
e-cycling is associated with lower ratings of perceived exer-
tion than conventional cycling [23, 26], potentially enabling
people to ride more frequently or for a longer duration. This
possibility is supported by Hendriksen and colleagues [41],
who reported that individuals in the Netherlands commuted
50% further with an e-bike than on a conventional bike.
Findings reported here suggest that e-cycling may be
suitable for individuals with compromised health. Han-
sen and colleagues [21] showed that e-cycling elicited
moderate intensity activity in older, obese individuals re-
covering from surgery due to coronary artery disease,
while Cooper and colleagues [32] reported that e-cycling
was feasible for middle-aged, overweight individuals with
type 2 diabetes mellitus.
Overall, while there is a trend towards increased fitness fol-
lowing engagement in e-cycling interventions, more interven-
tion research of a longer duration is required before the
long-term impact of e-cycling on health can be determined.
Fifty percent of the longitudinal studies in this review were ap-
proximately 1-month in length. This may not be enough time
to see changes in body composition and some metabolic out-
comes. Longer trials with larger samples sizes should be con-
ducted with a focus on including a range of health outcomes
in addition to cardiorespiratory fitness. These trials should
utilize randomized controlled designs and clearly report their
target population, recruitment process and dropouts and/or
withdrawals. Interventions should also be conducted in clinical
populations where physical activity is compromised. In
addition, more research is needed to understand the impact of
e-cycling on health based on sex or fitness level.
It is also important to consider the negative outcomes asso-
ciated with e-cycling when assessing their potential utilization
for health promotion. In the USA, e-bike users reported feel-
ing safer riding their e-bike than a conventional bike, stating
that the e-bike helped them to avoid crashes due to their sta-
bility, powerful brakes and the acceleration to avoid incidents
and keep up with traffic. However, riders reported cycling fas-
ter on an e-bike than a conventional bike and felt that other
road users misjudged their speed leading to potentially dan-
gerous situations [42]. In the Netherlands data suggest that,
Bourne et al. International Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity          (2018) 15:116 
Page 13 of 15
 after controlling for age, gender and amount of cycling, use of
an e-bike was associated with an increased risk of being in-
volved in a crash compared to conventional cycling [43]. The
severity of these crashes was not significantly different from
conventional cycling [43]. More context specific research is
required to enable a risk-benefit assessment of engaging spe-
cifically in e-cycling. Nevertheless, e-cyclists would be well
advised to be appropriately trained and use safety equipment
to minimize risk.
Strengths and limitations
This is the first review to examine the physical activity inten-
sity, cardiorespiratory, metabolic and psychological outcomes
associated with e-cycling. This review used two pragmatic
tools to assess the quality of studies and to provide an overall
rating of the evidence. These tools provided an overall repre-
sentation of the strength of research evidence related to
e-cycling and health. Limitations of this review include the
fact that some published studies may not have been identi-
fied. However, our systematic and broad search strategy
makes this unlikely. It is more likely that we did not identify
eligible unpublished studies or those published in an alterna-
tive language to English. Sample sizes used in studies were
small and sample size calculations were rarely reported.
Therefore, caution should be taken when interpreting the
statistical significance of evidence. Given the heterogeneity
in outcome measurement we were unable to quantify the
effects
of
e-cycling
on
outcomes
of
interest
using
meta-analyses. In addition, focus on quality of life as a psy-
chological outcome may have meant studies examining
psychological outcomes such as depression or anxiety were
excluded.
Conclusion
The composite results of the 17 studies included in this
novel systematic review provide moderate evidence that
e-cycling elicits activity at an intensity high enough to pro-
mote some positive health outcomes. E-cycling leads to re-
duced activity volume and intensity over the same distance
compared to conventional cycling. Therefore, e-cycling re-
quires more frequent and longer rides to accrue compar-
able health benefits. However, given that most individuals
travel by car to work [44] e-cycling offers a physically active
alternative to the largely sedentary behaviour associated
with motorized commuting. Furthermore, longitudinal
studies suggest, with moderate confidence, that e-cycling
can lead to increases in cardiorespiratory fitness. Longer
and higher-quality intervention studies, with transparent
reporting, are needed to develop a strong evidence-based
understanding of the impact of e-cycling on cardiorespira-
tory health and to explore the impact of e-cycling on meta-
bolic and psychological outcomes. This will extend the
current body of knowledge and provide guidance on public
health initiatives to promote e-cycling to improve popula-
tion health.
