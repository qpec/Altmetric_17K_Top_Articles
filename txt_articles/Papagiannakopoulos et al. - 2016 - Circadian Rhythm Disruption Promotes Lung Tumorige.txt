SUMMARY
Circadian rhythms are 24-hr oscillations that control a
variety of biological processes in living systems,
including two hallmarks of cancer, cell division and
metabolism. Circadian rhythm disruption by shift
work is associated with greater risk for cancer devel-
opment and poor prognosis, suggesting a putative
tumor-suppressive role for circadian rhythm homeo-
stasis. Using a genetically engineered mouse model
of lung adenocarcinoma, we have characterized the
effects of circadian rhythm disruption on lung tumor-
igenesis. We demonstrate that both physiologic
perturbation (jet lag) and genetic mutation of the cen-
tral circadian clock components decreased survival
and promoted lung tumor growth and progression.
The core circadian genes Per2 and Bmal1 were
shown to have cell-autonomous tumor-suppressive
roles in transformation and lung tumor progression.
Loss of the central clock components led to in-
creased c-Myc expression, enhanced proliferation,
and metabolic dysregulation. Our findings demon-
strate that both systemic and somatic disruption of
circadian rhythms contribute to cancer progression.
INTRODUCTION
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide
(Siegel et al., 2016). Despite the extensive characterization of
the somatic events that contribute to tumor initiation and pro-
gression, little is known about the role of physiologic risk fac-
tors, such as circadian rhythm disruption by shift work, in lung
tumorigenesis. Epidemiological studies have revealed that in-
dividuals who work night shifts are at higher risk for devel-
oping cancer (Hansen, 2001; Kloog et al., 2009; Megdal
et al., 2005; Schernhammer et al., 2001, 2006; Viswanathan
et al., 2007) or display poorer cancer prognosis (Lis et al.,
2003). The mammalian circadian machinery consists of a tran-
scription-translation autoregulatory feedback loop composed
of the transcriptional activators circadian locomotor output cy-
cles kaput (Clock) and aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear
translocator-like (Arntl, also known as Bmal1) and their target
genes Period (Per) and Cryptochrome (Cry), which rhythmi-
cally accumulate and form a repressor complex that interacts
with Clock/Bmal1 to inhibit their own transcription (Bass and
Takahashi, 2010; Sahar and Sassone-Corsi, 2009). Systemic
and tissue-specific disruption of the circadian machinery leads
to changes in cellular functions such as cell division and meta-
bolism, both highly relevant to cancer (Bass and Takahashi,
2010; Hanahan and Weinberg, 2011; Masri et al., 2016; Sahar
and Sassone-Corsi, 2009). Emerging evidence in several
different cellular and in vivo models points to an important
role of the core circadian genes in carcinogenesis (Filipski
et al., 2005; Fu et al., 2002; Gery et al., 2006; Janich et al.,
2011; Kettner et al., 2014; Lee et al., 2010; Puram et al.,
2016; Sahar and Sassone-Corsi, 2009; Van Dycke et al.,
2015; Wood et al., 2008).
Despite several lines of evidence implicating circadian
rhythm disruption in cancer, the underlying mechanism that
contributes to disease development remains elusive. It is un-
clear how oncogenic events may cooperate with circadian
clock disruption during cancer initiation and progression.
Our laboratory has established an autochthonous mouse
model
of
human
lung
adenoma
and
adenocarcinoma.
In these genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs),
lung tumors are induced in K-rasLSL-G12D/+;p53flox/flox (KP) or
K-rasLSL-G12D/+ (K) mice after intratracheal administration of
viral vectors expressing Cre-recombinase, which activate a
K-rasG12D allele alone or concomitantly delete the tumor sup-
pressor p53 in lung epithelial cells (Jackson et al., 2005).
KRAS and P53 are mutated in 30% and 50% of human lung
adenocarcinoma patients, respectively, making these GEMMs
highly relevant to a large subset of human lung cancers (Can-
cer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2014). In this study, we
used these GEMMs to model circadian rhythm disruption, and
we determined that both genetic and physiologic disruption of
circadian rhythms promoted lung tumorigenesis.
RESULTS
Physiologic Disruption of Circadian Rhythms by Jet Lag
Accelerates Lung Tumorigenesis
To investigate the role of circadian rhythm disruption in tumori-
genesis, we used pre-clinical GEMMs of human lung adenoma
and adenocarcinoma. Physiologic disruption of circadian rhythm

 was examined by placing KP animals in a normal 12-hr light/12-
hr dark schedule (LD12:12) or a previously described jet lag
schedule of 8-hr light advance every 2–3 days, which mimics
the circadian disturbance that humans undergo during shift
work (Lee et al., 2010; Thaiss et al., 2014). By measuring physical
activity, we confirmed that jet lag disrupted the circadian
behavior of animals (Figures 1A and 1B); this protocol has
been shown to disrupt the oscillations of the core circadian

 genes in multiple tissues (Filipski et al., 2005; Lee et al., 2010;
Thaiss et al., 2014).
Animals were placed in jet lag either a week prior to tumor initi-
ation (jet lag initiation) or 5 weeks after lung tumor initiation (jet
lag progression), and they remained under jet lag conditions until
the end of the study 13 weeks post-tumor initiation (Figure 1C).
Animals placed in jet lag during tumor progression for 8 weeks
post-infection had a significant increase in the lung tumor burden
(p < 0.05; Figure 1D) and a shift in the tumor grades, with fewer
grade 2 and more grade 3 and 4 tumors (grade 2, p < 0.05; grade
3, p < 0.01; Figure 1E) when compared to LD12:12 animals.
Furthermore, animals placed in jet lag post-tumor initiation (jet
lag progression) conditions showed decreased survival (9 days
median survival) (p < 0.01; Figure 1F). Jet lag starting a week
prior to tumor initiation (jet lag initiation) led to a modest but
non-significant increase in tumor burden (Figure 1D); however,
we did observe a significant increase in the percentage of
high-grade tumors in this cohort compared to LD12:12 animals
(grades 3 and 4, p < 0.05; Figure 1E). Overall, our data demon-
strate that physiologic disruption of circadian rhythms by simply
altering the light cycle accelerates lung tumorigenesis in the
context of Kras and p53 mutations.
Whole-Animal Loss of Per2 and Bmal1 Accelerates Lung
Tumorigenesis
Physiologic disruption of circadian rhythms by jet lag may
contribute to enhanced tumorigenesis in multiple ways, in-
cluding the effects of other hormones, feeding behavior, meta-
bolic alterations, inflammation, as well as desynchronization of
the circadian machinery. To further dissect the role of circadian
rhythm disruption in lung tumorigenesis, we performed genetic
disruption of the circadian machinery by whole-animal clock
disruption under normal LD12:12 conditions. We used a germ-
line mutant allele of Per2 (Per2m/m) (Zheng et al., 1999) and
generated K; Per2m/m and KP; Per2m/m animals. Upon tumor
initiation by intratracheal infection with viral Cre, both K (Figures
S1A and S1B) and KP (Figures 1G and 1H) animals that had sys-
temic Per2 loss of function exhibited increased tumor burden
and grade. Consistent with these findings, both K; Per2m/m
(p < 0.01; Figure S1C) and KP; Per2m/m (p < 0.001; Figure 1I) an-
imals also had decreased survival compared to wild-type
(Per2+/+) controls.
To further validate our finding from the Cre/LoxP-based
mouse model, we utilized an alternative autochthonous Kras-
driven GEMM (KrasLA2/+) that gives rise to sporadic non-viral-
induced tumors in various tissues (e.g., lymphoma, papilloma,
and lung) and 100% tumor penetrance in the lung (Johnson
et al., 2001). We assessed the effects of systemic circadian
rhythm disruption by both germline Per2 (Per2m/m) and Bmal1
mutation (Bmal1�/�) (Bunger et al., 2000). We observed that
both KrasLA2/+; Per2m/m and KrasLA2/+; Bmal1�/� animals had
an increased lung tumor number (p < 0.05 and p < 0.01; Figure 1J)
and exhibited decreased survival (p < 0.05 and p < 0.01; Fig-
ure 1K). We did not observe increased tumorigenesis in other
sporadic Kras-driven tumors in this model (data not shown).
Interestingly, KrasLA2/+; Bmal1�/� animals displayed a trend of
developing more lung tumors and poorer survival than KrasLA2/+;
Per2m/m animals, which may be explained by Bmal1 loss having
a greater impact on circadian rhythm disruption (Bunger et al.,
2000; Xu et al., 2007; Zheng et al., 1999). These data further sup-
port the conclusion that systemic circadian rhythm disruption by
genetic loss of function enhances lung tumorigenesis in two in-
dependent Kras-driven GEMMs.
Tumor Cell-Autonomous Role of Circadian Machinery in
Lung Cancer
To assess whether the increase in tumorigenesis upon circa-
dian rhythm disruption could be attributed to cancer cell-autono-
mous mechanisms, we utilized a conditional allele of Bmal1
(Bmal1flox/flox) (Storch et al., 2007) to delete Bmal1 specifically in
cancer cells in the K and KP models. Loss of Bmal1 (Bmal1D/D)
in tumors accelerated lung tumor progression in the K model (Fig-
ures 2A–2C). Interestingly, however, there was no increase in tu-
mor burden in KP tumors with conditional Bmal1 (Bmal1D/D) loss
(Figure S2A), suggesting a possible p53-dependent role for
Bmal1 as was suggested by a prior study (Mullenders et al., 2009).
To investigate the effects of Per2 loss in KP lung cancer cell
growth, we generated multiple cell lines from WT and Per2m/m
KP tumors of the same histological grade (Figure S2B). KP
Per2m/m cells proliferated faster and had a greater clonogenic
potential compared to WT KP cells (Figures S2C and S2D). To
ensure that the increased growth of KP Per2m/m tumor-derived
cells lines was not due to strain background, we confirmed the
tumor-suppressive role of Per2 by engineering loss-of-function
mutations in Per2 in isogenic C57BL/6 KP murine lung cancer
cells using CRISPR/Cas9-based editing (Figure S2E). We vali-
dated Cas9-based cutting and editing at the Per2 locus by
immunoblotting and Surveyor assay a week after introduction
of the CRISPR/Cas9 system using three independent short-
guide RNAs (sgRNAs) against Per2 (sgPer2.1, sgPer2.2, and
sgPer2.3) or a control non-targeting sgRNA (ctrl) (Figure 2D), ac-
cording to standard procedures (Ran et al., 2013; Sa
´ nchez-Riv-
era and Jacks, 2015; Sayin and Papagiannakopoulos, 2016).
Cells with CRISPR/Cas9-based knockout of Per2 (sgPer2.1
and sgPer2.3) displayed greater proliferation in low-density cul-
ture conditions (Figures 2E–2G) and tumor formation following
subcutaneous transplantation in congenic immunocompetent
C57BL/6 animals (Figure 2H).
The Tumor-Suppressive Role of Circadian Machinery
during Cellular Transformation
To assess whether Per2 loss promotes Kras-driven transforma-
tion, we derived mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) from K and
KP animals that also harbor mutant (Per2m/m) or WT Per2
(Per2+/+). MEFs were infected with adenoviral-Cre to induce
the KrasG12D/+ and KrasG12D/+; p53�/� mutations. We observed
that K and KP Per2m/m MEFs proliferated faster than the
Per2+/+ controls based on population doublings (Figures S3A
and S3B) and EdU incorporation (Figure 2I). KP; Per2m/m cells
also produced more colonies in low density (Figure 2J) and 3D
agar (Figure 2K) assays, which assess the ability of cells to pro-
liferate in limited paracrine signaling and anchorage-indepen-
dent conditions, respectively. Furthermore, Kras mutant MEFs
lacking Per2 function showed increased sensitivity to cellular
transformation upon overexpression of c-Myc or adenovirus
early region 1A (E1A) oncogenes compared to Per2+/+, based
on low- (Figures S3C and S3D) and high-density (Figure S3F)
growth assays as well as 3D agar growth assays (Figure S3E).

proliferation. BrdU incorporation analysis revealed increased

 rhythm regulation (Altman et al., 2015; Fu et al., 2002; Lee et al.,
2010). It also has been demonstrated that the core clock compo-
nents can negatively regulate c-Myc expression (Fu et al., 2002).
Therefore, we assayed the levels of c-Myc in autochthonous tu-
mors by immunohistochemistry (IHC). As shown in Figure 3, K;
Per2m/m (p < 0.05; Figures 3C and 3F), K; Bmal1D/D (p < 0.01; Fig-
ures 3C and 3G), and KP; Per2m/m (p < 0.0001; Figures 3D and 3I)
tumors showed a significant increase in the protein levels of
c-Myc as compared to control sample K and KP tumors (Figures
3C, 3E, and 3H).
Metabolic Reprogramming of Circadian Mutant Lung
Cancer Cells
Circadian rhythms are known to control a number of metabolic
processes, including oxidative phosphorylation (Peek et al.,
2013), redox homeostasis (Pekovic-Vaughan et al., 2014), and
lipid metabolism (Grimaldi et al., 2010). Recent work has demon-
strated that c-Myc dampens circadian oscillations by opposing
BMAL1 transcriptional oscillations and disrupting homeostatic
glucose and glutamine oscillations (Altman et al., 2015). We hy-
pothesized that the increased proliferation of circadian mutant
tumor cells may be due to upregulated c-Myc driving glycolysis
or glutaminolysis. Indeed, KP Per2 mutant cells had increased
rates of glucose consumption and increased levels of lactate
excretion compared to Per2+/+ cells (Figure 4A). Furthermore,
we observed a significant increase in the levels of glutamine con-
sumption in Per2 mutant cells, indicative of increased glutamine
usage (Figure 4B).
To determine whether the overall flux of glucose was differen-
tially regulated in Per2 mutant cells with high levels of c-Myc, we

 performed tracing of isotope-labeled glucose (U-13Cglucose).
Increased use of glucose for the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle
was detected as determined by carbon 4 labeling (M4) of TCA
cycle intermediates (Figure 4C). These data indicate that, in addi-
tion to increased glycolysis by lactate production, there is
increased utilization of glucose for the TCA cycle in the mito-
chondria. These data are in agreement with our recent findings
demonstrating that lung tumors have increased glucose contri-
bution to the TCA cycle relative to normal lung tissue (Davidson
et al., 2016).
Altered Expression of Circadian Machinery in Human
Lung Adenocarcinoma
Our data demonstrate a cell-autonomous oncogenic role for
circadian rhythm disruption in lung tumorigenesis in mouse
models of the disease as well as in tissue culture models of
cellular transformation. We next investigated whether the
expression of the core circadian pathway genes (PER1,
PER2, PER3, CRY1, CRY2, ARNTL, and CLOCK) is altered in
human lung adenocarcinomas. We examined the expression
levels of these core circadian genes in normal lung samples
(n = 58) compared to either matched tumors (n = 57) or all
lung adenocarcinomas (n = 431) in the The Cancer Genome
Atlas (TCGA) RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) expression dataset
(Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2014). With the
exception of CLOCK, whose expression was significantly
increased in tumors, the transcripts of all the circadian genes

Increased MYC Pathway Activity in

with Decreased PER2
Finally, we ranked KP lung tumors based
on their expression of PER2, and we used
the top and bottom 25% of tumors
(n = 12) and derived a signature of differ-
ential gene expression between these
sets. Subsequent gene set enrichment
analysis (GSEA) of this signature revealed
that tumors with low levels of PER2 were enriched in MYC signa-
tures (MYC_UP.V1_UP and DANG_MYC_TARGETS_UP), sug-
gesting that tumors with low PER2 may have increased MYC
activity (Figure S4B). These results are consistent with our
finding in the GEMM that loss of Per2 leads to an increase in
c-Myc activity.
DISCUSSION
Circadian rhythm disruption through shift work has been linked
to increased cancer risk in multiple types of cancer (Hansen,
2001; Kloog et al., 2009; Schernhammer et al., 2001, 2006).
The study of physiologic risk factors, such as circadian rhythm
disruption, has been largely hindered by the lack of rigorous
in vivo experimental systems. The data presented here demon-
strate that circadian rhythm disruption can promote lung tumor-
igenesis and support an important tumor-suppressive role for
circadian homeostasis. Our study illustrates that physiologic or
genetic (Bmal1/Per2) circadian disruption can cooperate with
Kras and p53 to promote lung tumorigenesis. Systemic loss of
Per2 and Bmal1 has differential effects on circadian behavior
of animals (Bunger et al., 2000; Zheng et al., 1999). Despite these
differences on whole-animal behavior, loss of Per2 or Bmal1
accelerated lung cancer.
Earlier reports using germline mutations in circadian compo-
nents have highlighted a role for circadian rhythm disruption in tu-
mor predisposition (Filipski et al., 2005; Fu et al., 2002; Gery et al.,
2006; Janich et al., 2011; Kettner et al., 2014; Lee et al., 2010; Sa-
har and Sassone-Corsi, 2009; Van Dycke et al., 2015; Wood et al.,
2008). We demonstrate through several in vitro and in vivo sys-
tems that tumor cell-specific deletion of core clock components

 leads to increased proliferation, c-Myc levels/activation, and
metabolic activity. Our results highlight the importance of cell-
autonomous circadian control of fundamental cellular processes
that are known hallmarks of cancer and promote cellular trans-
formation and tumor progression. Our results suggest that
increased tumor incidence in circadian mutant animals may be
a result of tumor cell-autonomous loss of circadian regulation,
which eliminates an additional barrier to transformation and
tumor progression.
Cell-autonomous loss of circadian rhythms in human malig-
nancies may occur through both genetic and epigenetic mecha-
nisms (Alhopuro et al., 2010; Chen et al., 2005; Kettner et al.,
2014; Taniguchi et al., 2009). We present evidence for decreased
expression of most circadian genes in human lung adenocarci-
noma patient tumors as compared to matched lung tissue.
Furthermore, tumors with decreased PER2 gene expression
show asignificantenrichmentinc-MYCtargetexpression,further
supporting our finding in the GEMMs, where both Per2 and
Bmal1 mutant lung tumors have increased levels of c-Myc. We
postulate that, as part of a homeostatic circadian clock, Per2
and Bmal1 converge in suppressing c-Myc during lung tumori-
genesis. Therefore, loss of Per2 or Bmal1 can independently
lead to increased c-Myc transcriptional output. Our results are
in line with prior studies revealing the competition between both
Per2 and Bmal1 with oncogenic c-MYC (Altman et al., 2015;
Fu et al., 2002; Lee et al., 2010). Puram et al. (2016) recently
demonstrated that loss of Bmal1 and Clock suppressed leuke-
mogenesis, suggesting that circadian disruption can have
context-specific effects in different types of cancers.
There are likely many cell-autonomous and non-autonomous
mechanisms that are altered in response to circadian disruption
that can influence tumorigenesis. In this study, we developed
new animal models that enabled us to comprehensively charac-
terize the tumorigenic role of systemic and cell-autonomous
circadian rhythm disruption. We anticipate our findings will pro-
vide the critical framework for future research that will further
elucidate the mechanisms of organismal and cellular control of
circadian oscillations on cancer initiation and progression.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Animal Experiments
All animal studies were approved by the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology (MIT) Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
KrasLSL-G12D/+;p53flox/flox (KP), KrasLSL-G12D/+ (K), and KrasLA2/+ mice already
have been described (DuPage et al., 2009; Jackson et al., 2001, 2005). All an-
imals with circadian mutant alleles were maintained on a mixed C57BL/6J 3
129SvJ genetic background. For jet lag experiments, we used pure 129SvJ
background. We used several existing circadian mutant alleles, which are
available from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories for germline mutant
Per2 (Per2tm1Brd/J) (Zheng et al., 1999), germline mutant Bmal1 (Arntltm1Bra/
J) (Bunger et al., 2000), and conditional Bmal1 (Arntltm1Weit/J) (Storch et al.,
2007). These mutants were crossed to K, KP, or KLA2 animals. Both male
and female mice were infected intratracheally with adenoviruses as described
(DuPage et al., 2009). Animals were injected intraperitoneally with 30 mg BrdU
per gram of body weight 4 hr prior to sacrificing animals.
Jet Lag Conditions and Activity Monitoring
Randomization was used for mice placed into LD12:12 or jet lag. For jet lag,
animals were placed in altered light-cycle conditions with 8-hr light advance
every 2–3 days (Filipski et al., 2005; Lee et al., 2010). Jet lag at initiation was
performed by placing animals in altered light conditions a week before tumor
initiation and keeping them under those conditions for 13 weeks. For jet lag at
progression, animals were placed in altered light conditions at 5 weeks post-
tumor initiation and kept in jet lag conditions for 8 weeks. Activity monitoring of
animals was recorded using wireless running wheels, and actogram data anal-
ysis was performed using wheel analysis software (MED Associates).
Statistics
The p values were determined by Student’s t test for all measurements of
tumor burden and IHC quantifications. Statistics (p values) for Kaplan-Meier
survival curves were determined using log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test. All statistics
were performed using GraphPad Prism 6. All error bars denote SEM.
