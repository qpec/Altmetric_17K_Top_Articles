Objectives: We compared incidence of dementia diagnosis by white, black, and Asian ethnic 
groups and estimated the proportion of UK white and black people developing dementia in 2015 
who had a diagnosis for the first time in a UK-wide study.
Methods: We analyzed primary care electronic health records from The Health Improvement 
Network database between 2007 and 2015 and compared incidence of dementia diagnosis to 
dementia incidence from community cohort studies. The study sample comprised of 2,511,681 
individuals aged 50–105 years who did not have a dementia diagnosis prior to the start of follow-up.
Results: A total of 66,083 individuals had a dementia diagnosis (4.87/1,000 person-years at 
risk, 95% CI 4.83–4.90); this incidence increased from 3.75 to 5.65/1,000 person-years at risk 
between 2007 and 2015. Compared with white women, the incidence of dementia diagnosis was 
18% lower among Asian women (adjusted incidence rate ratio (IRR) 0.82, 95% CI 0.72–0.95) 
and 25% higher among black women (IRR 1.25, 95% CI 1.07–1.46). For men, incidence of 
dementia diagnosis was 28% higher in the black ethnic group (IRR 1.28, 95% CI 1.08–1.50) and 
12% lower in the Asian ethnic group (IRR 0.88, 95% CI 0.76–1.01) relative to the white ethnic 
group. Based on diagnosis incidence in The Health Improvement Network data and projections 
of incidence from community cohort studies, we estimated that 42% of black men developing 
dementia in 2015 were diagnosed compared with 53% of white men.
Conclusion: People from the black ethnic group had a higher incidence of dementia diagnosis 
and those from the Asian ethnic group had lower incidence compared with the white ethnic 
group. We estimated that black men developing dementia were less likely than white men to 
have a diagnosis of dementia, indicating that the increased risk of dementia diagnosis reported 
in the black ethnic group might underestimate the higher risk of dementia in this group. It is 
unclear whether the lower incidence of dementia diagnosis in the Asian ethnic group reflects 
lower community incidence or underdiagnosis. A cohort study to determine this is needed.

Introduction
Around 46.8 million people worldwide have dementia. Based on projected demographic 
changes, this is expected to increase to 131.5 million by 2050.1 The majority of recent 
population-based studies have reported stable or declining age-adjusted dementia inci-
dence over time. These included a large UK community-based cohort study of people 
aged ≥65 years, which reported a 20% drop in age-stratified dementia incidence over 
20 years, with an overall incidence of 17.7/1,000 patient-years at risk (PYAR) between 
2008 and 2011.2 Reflecting the likelihood of people who have dementia receiving

a diagnosis, a previous study from The Health Improve-
ment Network (THIN) database found a stable incidence of 
dementia diagnosis in primary care between 1990 and 2007 
(3–4/1,000 PYAR).3 There is currently no evidence regard-
ing how the likelihood of receiving a diagnosis may differ 
between people living with dementia from different ethnic 
groups, although some evidence suggests that people from 
black and minority ethnic (BME) groups present later in their 
illness.4 This suggests that access to timely diagnosis may 
be inequitable, preventing some BME people from benefit-
ing from intervention and treatment as early as their white 
British counterparts.
In 2014, the Alzheimer’s Society (England and Wales) 
concluded that more epidemiological research is urgently 
required to clarify dementia risk among BME groups.5 
Incidence of dementia in BME people might differ from the 
majority population for several reasons. For instance, socially 
and culturally determined dietary and exercise patterns may 
affect dementia risk.6 Varying immigration histories will 
involve different exposures to host culture and risks, eg, 
social integration. Socioeconomic predictors of dementia, 
such as less formal education, lower income, and worse 
occupational conditions, are overrepresented in BME groups. 
Prevalence of genetic variants linked to dementia, such as 
ApoE-e4 genotype, differ across ethnic subgroups, with lower 
prevalence reported in Asian-American subgroups compared 
with the majority US population.7 Black and Asian ethnic 
groups experience more cardiometabolic risk factors, such 
as diabetes and obesity, which are dementia risk factors.8 Few 
community-based cohort studies have evaluated dementia 
incidence or prevalence in BME groups. In a London (UK) 
study, dementia prevalence was higher in African-Caribbean 
compared with older white people after adjusting for age and 
socioeconomic status (OR 3.1, 95% CI 1.3–7.3).9 In the only 
epidemiological studies to report dementia incidence in the 
Asian ethnic group, US-based studies have found that demen-
tia incidence is similar or lower among Japanese-Americans 
compared with Americans from white ethnic groups.7,10
Dementia diagnosis rates may also differ among ethnic 
groups because of differences in the likelihood of people 
living with dementia receiving a diagnosis. The best current 
evidence for ethnic differences in dementia diagnosis come 
from a large Californian (US) study. In data from patients 
aged ≥60 years recorded in a large insurance database from 
2000 to 2013, which included 3% of the state population and 
was broadly representative of the local area, age-standardized 
dementia incidence was 19.4/1,000 PYAR for white non-
Latino ethnic groups and 17.2/1,000 PYAR for the Asian 
ethnic group,7 with the highest dementia incidence reported 
for African-Americans (26.6/1,000 PYAR).11 Among the 
Asian ethnic group, rates for South Asian people were lower 
than for other Asian backgrounds (12.1/1,000 PYAR).7
In this study, we reported the incidence of dementia diag-
nosis in UK primary care between 2007 and 2015 and inci-
dence by ethnic group for the first time in a sample broadly 
representative of the UK population. Using UK census data 
and current best evidence of community dementia incidence, 
we estimated the incidence of dementia in people of white 
and black ethnicities, and based on this, the proportion of 
white and black people developing dementia who received 
a diagnosis. We examined the hypothesis that black people 
developing dementia would be less likely to receive a diag-
nosis than people from the white ethnic group. There is 
currently no data available on the incidence of dementia in 
Asian people living with dementia in the UK.
Aims
Our aims were to report the incidence of dementia diagnosis 
over time (2007–2015) in UK primary care; to report the 
incidence of dementia diagnosis by white, black, and Asian 
ethnic groups in UK primary care for the first time; and to 
compare the community incidence of dementia with incidence 
of dementia diagnosis in 2015, in order to examine our hypoth-
esis that black people with dementia would be less likely to 
receive a diagnosis than people from the white ethnic group.5,9
Methods
Data source
We used THIN database,12 one of the UK’s largest databases 
of primary care electronic health records, which has been 
shown to be broadly representative of the UK population.13 
At the time of data collection, the database contained 645 
participating general practices contributing data from >14 
million patients. THIN holds longitudinal records of patients’ 
medical conditions, symptoms, diagnoses, and prescriptions 
which are recorded during routine primary care consultations 
from the time of registration with the practices. The Read 
code hierarchical system is used to record clinical informa-
tion, including symptoms and diagnoses.14 In addition, THIN 
also captures basic demographic information, including 
sex and year of birth. Social deprivation is measured by the 
Townsend deprivation score (available in quintiles),15 which is 
a composite index of owner occupation, car ownership, over-
crowding, and unemployment, based on the patient’
s postcode 
and information from the 2001 census data. Diagnoses and

Trends in dementia-diagnosis rates in UK ethnic groups
prescriptions are generally well recorded in THIN16 and have 
been used successfully in previous dementia studies.3,17–19
Ethics approval
Use of THIN for scientific research was approved by the 
National Health Service (NHS) South-East Multi-Centre 
Research Ethics Committee in 2003. Scientific approval 
to undertake this study was obtained from IQVIA World 
Publications Scientific Review Committee in March 2017 
(reference 17THIN019).
Study population
We included individuals aged 50–105 years contributing data 
to THIN between January 1, 2007 and December 31, 2015. 
This was a dynamic cohort, with people entering and exiting 
the study at different times. Individuals were followed up 
from the latest of: January 1, 2007; their 50th birthday; 6 
months after registration with the general practice (to exclude 
prevalent cases being newly recorded upon registration with 
the practice);3 or when the practice met standard criteria for 
acceptable mortality reporting (AMR) and acceptable com-
puter usage (ACU).20,21 The end date was defined as the earliest 
of: the first record indicative of dementia or an antidementia 
drug prescription; patient’s death; patient leaving the practice; 
practice leaving THIN database; or December 31, 2015.
Main outcome and risk-factor 
measurements
To identify incident diagnoses of dementia in THIN, we 
developed lists of Read codes and antidementia drugs 
(prescribed only for dementia) and searched medical and 
prescription records for codes indicative of dementia. We 
excluded individuals with a diagnosis of dementia before the 
start of follow-up, as well as those with a diagnosis within 
the first 6 months after registration, to ensure only incident 
cases were captured.
Age was analyzed in 10-year age groups (the last age group 
was 100–105 years, as this was the maximum age included). We 
examined social deprivation using quintiles of the Townsend 
deprivation score.15 As a proxy measure for comorbidity, we 
included the prescribing index, which indicates the number of 
the British National Formulary chapters from which patients 
received prescriptions (excluding antidementia drugs, vac-
cines, and anesthetics) and predicts adverse outcomes, as 
well as more complex comorbidity indices.22 We developed 
code lists to search for ethnicity information in medical and 
additional health records. Information extracted on ethnicity 
was grouped into white (British or other white background), 
Asian (Indian, Pakistani, Bangladeshi, Chinese, or other Asian 
background), black (African, Caribbean, or other black back-
ground), and mixed/other ethnic groups, based on the Office 
for National Statistics (ONS) classification.23
Statistical analyses
We estimated the overall crude incidence of dementia diagno-
sis per 1,000 PYAR by summing the number of patients with 
a first record indicative of dementia diagnosis between 2007 
and 2015 and dividing this by the total number of person-
years of follow-up for this period. We also determined crude 
incidence by calendar year and ethnicity by restricting the 
number of cases and person-years of follow-up to the respec-
tive categories. We estimated incidence rate ratios (IRR) 
for Asian, black, and mixed/other ethnic groups (compared 
to the white ethnic group) by fitting multivariable Poisson 
regression models with log person-time as an offset separately 
for men and women. We examined relative changes in IRRs 
for ethnicity after adjusting for age (in 10-year age groups) 
and calendar year (2007–2015, M0), social deprivation (in 
quintiles of the Townsend score, M1), the prescribing index 
(M2), and a binary indicator of diabetes (M3). Models M1–
M3 incrementally added a given variable to all the variables 
previously included in M0. All analyses were conducted in 
Stata version 14.2.24 We reported but did not interpret results 
for the mixed/other ethnic group, as we considered this group 
to be too heterogeneous to do so.
Multiple imputation of missing data
Under the assumption of data being missing at random,25 mul-
tiple imputation can provide unbiased and statistically more 
powerful results compared with a complete case analysis by 
using information from individuals with incomplete data.26 
However, it was not possible to ascertain whether data were 
truly missing at random from the observed data alone. To 
increase the plausibility of the missing at random assumption, 
we included in our imputation model a wide range of variables 
that were thought to be predictive of the missing values in 
ethnicity, as well as the chance of ethnicity being recorded.27
We used the multivariate imputation by chained equations 
algorithm28–30 for multiple imputation of missing data in eth-
nicity and Townsend deprivation score. For each incomplete 
variable, an imputation model was constructed conditional 
on variables in the main analysis (indicator of dementia, 
follow-up time, age group, prescribing index, indicator of 
diabetes), other disease indicators recorded at any time in the 
patient records (myocardial infarction, stroke, chronic kidney 
disease, thalassemia, and schizophrenia), lifestyle factors

recorded during 1 year before or after the start of follow-up 
(height, weight, smoking status, alcohol consumption), and 
the other incomplete variables. Since the lifestyle factors 
also contained missing values, they were imputed along-
side ethnicity and Townsend score in the algorithm. Using 
appropriate regression models, we examined the association 
between complete variables (indicator of dementia, follow-up 
time, age group, prescribing index, indicator of diabetes, and 
other disease indicators) and incomplete variables (ethnicity, 
Townsend score, height, weight, smoking status, and alcohol 
consumption), as well as their binary response indicators, 
and concluded that data were not likely to be missing com-
pletely at random for these incomplete variables. Multiple 
imputation was performed in Stata version 14.224 using the 
“mi impute chained”31 command based on the missing at 
random assumption. After 10 cycles of the chained equations, 
20 imputed data sets were created for men and women sepa-
rately to reflect potential interactions in the main analysis. 
Each imputed data set was analyzed identically, and results 
combined using Rubin’s rules.32,33
Comparison with community studies
We compared incidence of dementia diagnosis in black and 
white people with community incidence of dementia based 
on bespoke cohort studies and the age–sex structure of the 
UK population. We did not perform these estimations for 
people in the Asian ethnic group due to a lack of evidence 
regarding incidence of dementia in this group. This was per-
formed after missing values in ethnicity had been handled by 
a complete case analysis or multiple imputation, as described 
in the previous section.
We used the sex- and age-specific incidences reported by 
Matthews et al2 from the second phase of the Medical Research 
Council Cognitive Function & Ageing Study (CFAS II) as 
incidences among the white ethnic group. We took the ratios 
of the incidences of African-American and white non-Latino 
American reported in a systematic review by Mehta and Y
eo34 
to estimate the proportions in the black ethnic group (incidence 
ratio 1.63). This was done based on the assumptions that inci-
dences are relatively similar between US and UK populations; 
the ethnicity-specific dementia incidence association is broadly 
similar for females and males across age groups; and THIN is 
broadly representative of the UK population. The overall UK 
population by sex and age group in 2015 was obtained from 
the ONS data, and the UK population by sex and age group for 
white and black ethnicities was estimated using the UK 2011 
census figures for the distribution of ethnicity.35,36
For complete case analysis, we first restricted our THIN 
cohort to individuals with a record of ethnicity. To estimate 
the number of new dementia diagnoses in THIN, we counted 
the number of individuals who were actively registered with 
THIN practices in 2015 by sex, age group, and white and black 
ethnicities. For the white ethnic group, these counts were then 
multiplied by the incidence of dementia taken from Matthews 
et al.2 For the black ethnic group, the corresponding counts were 
multiplied by 1.63 times Matthews et al’
s estimated incidence of 
dementia.2 We then counted the observed number of individuals 
who were actively registered with THIN practices in 2015 and 
received a diagnosis of dementia in 2015 by sex, age group, 
and white and black ethnicities. This was divided by the cor-
responding estimated number of dementia diagnoses calculated 
earlier to obtain the estimated percentage of diagnoses in 2015.
For multiple imputation, after performing multiple imputa-
tion of missing values in ethnicity in our cohort, we counted 
the total number of individuals who were actively registered 
with THIN practices in 2015 by sex and age group. We then 
estimated white and black ethnic proportions by sex and 
age group among these individuals in each imputed data set 
and combined the results to obtain an overall set of ethnic 
proportions using Rubin’s rules.32,33 These proportions were 
multiplied by the total counts in the previous step to obtain 
the estimated number of individuals actively registered with 
THIN practices in 2015 by sex, age group, and white and black 
ethnicities. To estimate the number of new dementia diagnoses 
in THIN for the white ethnic group, these were multiplied by 
the incidence of dementia taken from Matthews et al.2 We 
followed the same procedure as before to obtain the estimated 
number of dementia diagnoses in THIN for the black ethnic 
group. To estimate the number of white and black individuals 
who were diagnosed with dementia in 2015, we counted the 
total number of individuals who were diagnosed with dementia 
in 2015, obtained estimated proportions of white and black 
individuals with a diagnosis in 2015 from the imputed data sets 
as before, and multiplied the two together. These numbers were 
then divided by the estimated number of dementia diagnoses 
to obtain the estimated percentage of diagnoses in 2015.
To obtain overall percentages of dementia diagnoses for 
white and black men and women, the estimated percentages 
obtained from complete case analysis and multiple imputation 
were age-standardized based on the age distribution by sex and 
white and black ethnicities in the UK population and our sample.
Results
We reported the results of our complete case and multiple-
imputation analyses throughout, but considered the multiple 
imputation results our primary findings. This was because we 
identified variables associated with ethnicity and the record-
ing of ethnicity, and made an assumption that missing values

were missing at random. Under this missingness assumption, 
multiple imputation analysis can be unbiased and statistically 
more powerful compared with a complete case analysis.
Complete case analysis
Of the 2,511,681 older individuals (Table 1), we identified 
66,083 (3%) individuals with a record indicating that they had 
a first diagnosis of dementia between 2007 and 2015. This 
was equivalent to an incidence of 4.87/1,000 PYAR (95% 
CI 4.83–4.90). The overall incidence of dementia increased 
over time from 3.75 to 5.65 cases per 1,000 PYAR between 
2007 and 2015 (Figure 1A). Among those diagnosed with 
dementia, 36,439 (55%) individuals had missing ethnicity; for 
those whom ethnicity was known, 28,672 (97%) were in the 
white ethnic group, 480 (2%) in the Asian ethnic group, 315 
(1%) in the black ethnic group, and 177 (<1%) in the mixed/
other group. Overall, for individuals with a record of ethnicity 
(1,178,111, 47%), the annual incidence of dementia diagno-
sis also followed an upward trend and appeared comparable 
between the white, Asian, and black ethnic groups (Figure 
1B). Townsend deprivation score was available for 2,452,173 
(98%) individuals. Restricting the analysis to the complete 
cases (those without missing values in ethnicity and Townsend 
score) reduced the sample size to 1,144,195 individuals with 
28,795 cases of dementia, corresponding to an incidence of 
4.64/1,000 PYAR (95% CI 4.59–4.70).
Table 2 show adjusted IRRs of dementia for Asian, 
black, and mixed/other ethnic groups (compared with the 
white ethnic group) from multivariable Poisson regression 
models, and results are presented separately for men and 
women. In the first model adjusted for age and calendar 
year (M0), incidence of dementia diagnosis appeared to be 
similar between white and Asian ethnic groups (IRR 1.01, 
95% CI 0.88–1.15 for men; IRR 0.96, 95% CI 0.84–1.09 for 
women). Incidence of dementia diagnosis among black men 
was 1.31 times higher than that among white men (95% CI 
1.10–1.56), and similarly a higher incidence was seen among 
black women compared with white women (IRR 1.38, 95% 
CI 1.19–1.60). Adjusting for the Townsend deprivation score 
(M1), prescribing index (M2), and indicator of diabetes (M3)

reduced the estimated IRRs for the Asian and black ethnic 
groups in both men and women.
In the fully adjusted model (M3), incidence was found to 
be slightly lower for the Asian ethnic group compared with 
the white ethnic group in both men and women (IRR 0.87, 
95% CI 0.76–0.99 for men; IRR 0.88, 95% CI 0.77–0.99 for 
women). The black ethnic group was associated with a higher 
incidence of dementia diagnosis compared with the white 
ethnic group, and this association was stronger for women 
compared with men (IRR 1.15, 95% CI 0.97–1.37 for men; 
IRR 1.24, 95% CI 1.07–1.44 for women).
Multiple imputation analysis
There were 471,433 (19%) individuals who had complete 
data in ethnicity, Townsend deprivation score, height, weight, 
smoking status, and alcohol consumption. In total, 1,333,570 
(53%) missing values in ethnicity, 59,508 (2%) missing values 
in Townsend deprivation score, 241,614 (10%) missing values 
in height, 1,142,332 (46%) missing values in weight, 702,647 
(28%) missing values in smoking status, and 1,565,757 (62%) 
missing values in alcohol consumption were imputed.
Results of the multiple imputation analysis were com-
parable with that of the complete case analysis and are pre-
sented in Table 3 for men and women separately, including 
the ethnicity-specific IRRs of dementia diagnosis adjusted 
for age group, calendar year, Townsend deprivation score,

Pham et al
registered in 2015, after multiple imputation of missing val-
ues. The percentages of dementia diagnoses were 49% and 
51% for women of black and white ethnicities, respectively. 
For black and white men, these were estimated to be 42% 
and 53%, respectively. Percentages of dementia diagnoses 
in the complete case analysis were comparable but slightly 
lower, since individuals diagnosed with dementia who did 
not have a record of ethnicity were not included in the cal-
culations (Table S1).
Discussion
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to compare 
incidence of dementia diagnosis among ethnic groups in a 
nationally representative sample and to evaluate whether 
ethnicity is associated with the likelihood of people with 
dementia receiving a diagnosis. We found that compared 
with the white ethnic group, Asian women were 18% less 
likely and Asian men 12% less likely to have a new dementia 
diagnosis. By contrast, black women were 25% more likely 
and black men 28% more likely to receive a new dementia 
diagnosis compared with the white ethnic group. Through 
comparison with community cohort studies, we estimated that 
the increased incidence of dementia in black men was only 
partly reflected in these diagnoses, and that black men with 
dementia were less likely to receive a diagnosis compared 
with white men. In black and white women with dementia, 
we estimated that the likelihood of receiving a diagnosis of 
dementia was broadly comparable.
The only community cohort studies in Asian populations 
have been in Japanese-American people.7 These indicated 
that dementia incidence is lower than or comparable with 
the white majority ethnic groups. It is thus possible that the 
lower incidence of dementia diagnosis we found in Asian 
people after controlling for morbidity and area deprivation 
reflected lower dementia incidence. Several known lifestyle 
and environmental risk factors for dementia are more com-
mon in Asian compared with white majority groups in the 
UK.7 These include lower levels of formal education, which 
we were not able to measure, as well as cardiovascular risk 
factors. Differing levels of genetic susceptibility among 
ethnic groups are one possible explanation for the apparent 
paradox of lower dementia diagnosis incidence in a popula-
tion with more prevalent environmental and lifestyle risk 
factors.7 Lower incidence of dementia diagnosis in Asian 
people is another explanation.
Our finding that black men with dementia appeared 
relatively less likely to receive a diagnosis of dementia than 
men from the white majority population is concerning. A 
previous qualitative study of attitudes to dementia reported 
a perception among people from black ethnic groups in the 
UK that dementia was “a white person’s illness”, that seeking 
medical help was pointless or only for severe problems, and 
that dementia was a private and stigmatizing problem.37 Our 
results could indicate that black men experience barriers to 
accessing health services or receiving a diagnosis. Family 
concerns about previous negative experiences of psychiatric 
services may be particularly significant in BME groups. 
Clinicians may be more reluctant to diagnose dementia in 
BME groups, due to awareness of cultural bias in standard 
cognitive tests, especially if appropriate culturally competent 
tests are unavailable.38 In UK South Asian people, it has been 
suggested that delayed help-seeking for dementia might be 
explained by stigma linked with ideas of “madness”, lack 
of physical etiology and lack of treatment, as well as fear of 
moves to long-term care.39
Our findings suggested a small rise in age-adjusted inci-
dence of dementia diagnosis since 2011. The most recent 
population-based studies have reported stable or declining 
age-standardized dementia prevalence over time. The rise 
in likelihood of people with dementia receiving a diagnosis 
over this time probably explains our findings. The propor-
tion of people with dementia who were diagnosed has risen 
significantly over this time, in response to a major national 
program to improve diagnosis rates: from an estimated 42% 
in 2010–2011 to 67% by 2015.40
Strengths of this study included the large, representative 
sample: THIN database comprises around 6% of the UK 
population and has been found to be broadly representative in 
terms of demographic and health variables, although slightly 
more THIN patients live in affluent areas compared with the 
general population.13 We reported findings from our multiple 
imputation analysis as our primary results, because they were 
inclusive of a greater proportion of the cohort (sample size 
was increased from 1,144,195 in a complete case analysis 
to 2,511,681 in the multiple imputation analysis). We also 
reported findings from a complete case analysis that were 
comparable with those in multiple imputation. Complete case 
analysis generally showed smaller differences in incidence of 
dementia diagnosis among ethnic groups. Most noticeably, 
the difference in incidence of dementia diagnosis between 
black and white men was smaller among the complete cases 
compared with the multiple imputation analysis.
Our primary exposure was self-reported ethnic group. We 
reported ethnicity as black, Asian, white, or mixed/other, as 
data at more detailed levels were less well recorded. Ethnic-
ity is a complex construct that varies in definition over time.

Trends in dementia-diagnosis rates in UK ethnic groups
Ethnic groups are considered those sharing a common ances-
try, culture, historical memories, attachment to a homeland, 
and feeling of solidarity with one another. There is wide 
variation within minority ethnic groups in country of origin, 
language, religion, socioeconomic power, and experiences, 
but there is also enough shared culture with regard to family 
structures, identity, and health beliefs to make ethnicity a 
relevant factor with respect to health behaviors.41 Although 
we attempted to account for the uncertainty associated with 
incomplete information on ethnicity by using an increased 
number of imputations (20 imputed data sets) and includ-
ing many variables in the imputation model for ethnicity to 
enhance the plausibility of the missing at random assump-
tion, results still need to be interpreted with caution, due the 
relatively high level of missing data on ethnicity.
Our estimates of the proportion of people with dementia 
receiving diagnoses assumed that the ratios of incidence of 
dementia between UK black and white ethnic groups were 
comparable with  those reported between African-American 
and white non-Latino American people in a large meta-
analysis.34 This was a conservative estimate of the ratio: it 
excluded Hispanic-Caribbean populations, who have a higher 
incidence of dementia than African-American groups.34 Over 
two-thirds of African-Americans in the USA are of West 
African heritage,42 whereas in the UK 2011 census, just over 
half the people who identified as being from a black ethnic 
group identified as black African, with black Caribbean the 
second-most common group. It is possible that if dementia 
risk is similarly increased in UK black Caribbean relative to 
black African groups, our incidence estimates for the black 
ethnicity may have been an underestimate. Our assumption 
that ethnicity-specific dementia-incidence association is 
broadly similar for females and males across age groups is 
based on the absence of evidence of any sex effect; however, 
lack of evidence of effect is not evidence of lack of effect.
The estimated proportions of dementia cases that were 
diagnosed in general practitioner (GP) records among black 
and white ethnic groups were lower than have been ascer-
tained from other methods. Although it was estimated from 
national data that 67% of people living with dementia in 2015 
received a diagnosis,40 we estimated that only around half the 
people with dementia received a diagnosis. Our estimates 
were based on an assumption that THIN sample was nation-
ally representative, but there is evidence that people living 
in more deprived areas may be underrepresented in THIN.13 
As dementia is more common in more deprived areas,18 this 
could explain why our diagnosis incidence estimates were 
lower than those reported in national data. As BME people 
may be more likely to live in deprived areas, incidence of 
dementia diagnosis reported in BME groups may have been 
an underestimate. There is also some evidence that dementia 
is underrecorded in GP records across ethnic groups.3 The 
use of an area-level deprivation measure is a limitation, as 
individual deprivation level can sometimes be at odds with 
the deprivation level of the area in which a person lives.
In our previous dementia studies using THIN data,18,19 we 
found that accounting for practice-level variation had little 
effect on the results. Because of this, and the complexities 
of performing a multiple imputation analysis that reflects 
the clustering structure of the analysis model, we did not 
examine variation across general practices in this paper. We 
could not identify people with undiagnosed dementia or 
control for dementia severity. Although we reported under-
diagnosis in nonwhite ethnic groups, there is some evidence 
that false-positive dementia diagnoses may be more common 
in UK minority ethnic groups because standard cognitive 
assessments underestimate abilities.43 Although diagnoses 
of dementia are often made in memory services in the UK, 
there may be variation between primary care practices in how 
dementia diagnoses are made and recorded in BME groups, 
eg, in interpreter availability.
Conclusion
In this first study to report dementia diagnosis rates among 
ethnic groups in a large nationally representative sample, we 
found that people from Asian UK ethnic groups were less 
likely and those from black ethnic groups more likely to 
receive a dementia diagnosis compared with the white major-
ity population. By comparing these incidence estimates to 
those from community cohort studies, we concluded that the 
increased incidence of dementia diagnosis in black men only 
partly reflects their higher dementia incidence. We estimated 
that black men with dementia were around 10% less likely to 
be diagnosed than white men. The lower incidence of demen-
tia diagnosis in Asian populations may reflect underdiagnosis 
or lower incidence of dementia. A community cohort study 
is needed to determine how dementia incidence may differ 
among ethnic groups, especially between Asian and white 
majority ethnic groups.

Clinical Epidemiology is an international, peer-reviewed, open access, 
online journal focusing on disease and drug epidemiology, identifica-
tion of risk factors and screening procedures to develop optimal pre-
ventative initiatives and programs. Specific topics include: diagnosis, 
prognosis, treatment, screening, prevention, risk factor modification, 
 
systematic reviews, risk and safety of medical interventions, epidemiol-
ogy and biostatistical methods, and evaluation of guidelines, translational 
 
medicine, health policies and economic evaluations. The manuscript 
management system is completely online and includes a very quick 
and fair peer-review system, which is all easy to use.

Notes: Incidence in the white ethnic group obtained from Matthews et al;1 incidence in black ethnic group obtained by multiplying that in the white ethnic group by 1.63;2 
results obtained following complete case analysis excluding individuals with missing data in The Health Improvement Network (THIN) sample. Cell values displayed as 
frequency in columns a,c–f; proportion in column b;  and percentage in column g. Cell calculations: c=a×b, e=d×b, g=(f/e)×(a/∑a)/(d/∑d)×100.
