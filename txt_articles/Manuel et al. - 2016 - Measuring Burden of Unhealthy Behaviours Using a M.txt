Abstract
Background
Behaviours such as smoking, poor diet, physical inactivity, and unhealthy alcohol consump-
tion are leading risk factors for death. We assessed the Canadian burden attributable to
these behaviours by developing, validating, and applying a multivariable predictive model
for risk of all-cause death.
Methods
A predictive algorithm for 5 y risk of death—the Mortality Population Risk Tool (MPoRT)—
was developed and validated using the 2001 to 2008 Canadian Community Health Surveys.
There were approximately 1 million person-years of follow-up and 9,900 deaths in the devel-
opment and validation datasets. After validation, MPoRT was used to predict future mortal-
ity and estimate the burden of smoking, alcohol, physical inactivity, and poor diet in the
presence of sociodemographic and other risk factors using the 2010 national survey
(approximately 90,000 respondents). Canadian period life tables were generated using pre-
dicted risk of death from MPoRT. The burden of behavioural risk factors attributable to life
expectancy was estimated using hazard ratios from the MPoRT risk model.
Findings
The MPoRT 5 y mortality risk algorithms were discriminating (C-statistic: males 0.874 [95%
CI: 0.867–0.881]; females 0.875 [0.868–0.882]) and well calibrated in all 58 predefined

 subgroups. Discrimination was maintained or improved in the validation cohorts. For the
2010 Canadian population, unhealthy behaviour attributable life expectancy lost was 6.0
years for both men and women (for men 95% CI: 5.8 to 6.3 for women 5.8 to 6.2). The Cana-
dian life expectancy associated with health behaviour recommendations was 17.9 years
(95% CI: 17.7 to 18.1) greater for people with the most favourable risk profile compared to
those with the least favourable risk profile (88.2 years versus 70.3 years). Smoking, by itself,
was associated with 32% to 39% of the difference in life expectancy across social groups
(by education achieved or neighbourhood deprivation).
Conclusions
Multivariable predictive algorithms such as MPoRT can be used to assess health burdens
for sociodemographic groups or for small changes in population exposure to risks, thereby
addressing some limitations of more commonly used measurement approaches. Unhealthy
behaviours have a substantial collective burden on the life expectancy of the Canadian
population.
Author Summary
Why Was This Study Done?
• The burden of unhealthy behaviours and other risk factors is commonly calculated
using aggregate, indirectly linked data. Amongst other limitations, there are concerns
that these data are poorly suited for assessing equity.
• Increasingly, population health surveys are being linked, at the individual level, to health
outcomes. We examined the role of assessing the burden of unhealthy behaviours using
individual, as opposed to aggregate, data.
What Did the Researchers Do and Find?
• We generated a multivariable predictive algorithm of health behaviours and mortality
(MPoRT) using the Ontario sample of the linked Canadian Community Health Survey
(CCHS). There were approximately 1 million person-years of follow-up and 9,900
deaths in the development and validation datasets.
• Next, the burden of unhealthy behaviours was estimated by applying the MPoRT risk
tool to the most current version of the CCHS.
• For the 2010 Canadian population, 6.0 y of life expectancy lost were attributable to
unhealthy behaviours
• Smoking, by itself, contributed 32% to 39% of the difference in life expectancy across
social groups.
• The Canadian life expectancy for people adhering to health behaviour recommendations
was 17.9 y greater than for people with the least favourable risk profile.

 What Do These Findings Mean?
• Unhealthy behaviours contribute to a large burden of reduced life expectancy.
• Linked population health surveys create an opportunity to estimate burden of disease
using individual-based data, as in our multivariable predictive approach, and to supple-
ment existing aggregate approaches.
• Multivariable risk algorithms can be validated and calibrated for potential application in
over 100 countries, potentially allowing widespread use of multivariable approaches.
• Multivariable risk algorithms are more complex than alternative approaches to measure
burden from health behaviours, but their use can be facilitated by reporting the algo-
rithm in machine-readable format (https://github.com/Ottawa-mHealth/predictive-
algorithms) and/or by providing online calculators (https://www.projectbiglife.ca).
Introduction
Unhealthy behaviours, including smoking, poor diet, physical inactivity, and unhealthy alcohol
consumption, are leading risk factors for premature mortality worldwide [1–3]. Measuring the
burden of health-behaviour–related deaths in populations is challenging because standard
death certificates do not provide information about underlying risks factors for disease. Previ-
ous population burden studies have addressed this challenge using two methods. The most
commonly used method—aggregated data approach, used in the Global Burden of Disease
study and first described by Levin—starts with disease-specific mortality and indirectly attri-
butes underlying risks to a fraction of deaths according to separately measured estimates of the
association between the exposures and disease [2,4,5]. The second method, the population
cohort approach, starts with population-based health surveys that individually ascertain expo-
sures to different health behaviours [6,7]. Respondents are followed until death, with attribu-
tion of unhealthy behaviours estimated directly from a multivariable regression model.
We propose a method to estimate mortality attributable to unhealthy behaviour using risk
algorithms that directly incorporate a variety of baseline characteristics and risk factors. We
call this a baseline risk or multivariable predictive approach [8,9]. This approach combines
aspects of aggregated data and population cohort approaches but has advantages that we
describe briefly here and further in the Discussion. All three approaches use population-based
health surveys to estimate population exposure to various behaviours. Such surveys are now
being performed in over 100 countries, but only a few countries link respondents to death cer-
tificates; without this linkage, the cohort method—which requires respondent follow-up—can-
not be used. In the multivariable predictive approach, validated risk algorithms can be applied
to unlinked exposure data from population health surveys. This has the potential to provide
mortality risk estimates for survey respondents in many different countries.
The multivariable predictive approach uses individual-level data to address several chal-
lenges with the current Global Burden of Disease study. Most importantly, the Global Burden
of Disease study has acknowledged challenges in examining burden from an equity perspective,
such as by socioeconomic position, and the authors have suggested that “capacity and methods

 to undertake this type of analysis need to be created or strengthened” [10]. Other challenges
include estimating the burden from incremental changes in risk factors and adjusting for the
joint distribution of risk factors and their interactions [10]. Furthermore, multivariable risk
algorithms are characterized as the most discriminating and accurate approach to estimating
baseline risk [11–13]. Baseline risk assessment has been a cornerstone of health planning in
both population and clinical settings for over 30 y. In the words of Geoffrey Rose, “all policy
decisions should be based on absolute (baseline) measures of risk.”
The example of burden attributable to smoking in Canada is illustrative of how the multi-
variable predictive approach can improve policy development and evaluation. Twenty years
ago, policy action for smoking prevention was galvanized when smoking-attributable burden
was estimated at 40,000 to 45,000 deaths annually [14]. Unfortunately, an equity assessment of
smoking burden was not performed; the resulting inequitable uptake of smoking prevention
and cessation strategies widened the socioeconomic gap in avoidable deaths [15]. Furthermore,
smoking is more heavily concentrated in specific groups, including people with low socioeco-
nomic position, who have additional health behaviour risks and/or comorbid conditions.
Assuming all smokers of a particular age have the same risk of death and distribution of risk
factors—an assumption of the aggregated data approach—results in poor risk discrimination
and underestimation of the burden of smoking, particularly for people with low socioeconomic
position [14]. Lastly, smoking consumption has been changing: in Canada there are fewer
heavy smokers and more former smokers who have an earlier age of smoking cessation (longer
time since quitting). Measuring the reduced burden of smoking from these incremental
changes in smoking consumption is best calculated when the measurement of smoking expo-
sure and hazards reflects changing smoking consumption. Typically, the aggregated data
approach categorizes smoking burden into current, former, or never smoker, whereas the mul-
tivariable predictive approach is well suited to assess individual-level exposure using a wider
range of measures, such as heavy and light smokers and recent and remote time since
cessation.
We sought to estimate the mortality burden attributable to four behavioural risk factors in
Canada (smoking, unhealthy alcohol consumption, physical inactivity, and poor diet) using a
multivariable predictive approach. The study had two objectives: (1) to develop and validate a
5 y all-cause mortality risk prediction algorithm for a general population (Mortality Population
Risk Tool, or MPoRT) using a population health survey, and (2) to apply MPoRT to a recent
Canadian population health survey to estimate the life expectancy lost due to unhealthy behav-
iours. We also calculate life expectancy for people who smoke and smoking-attributable mor-
tality by socioeconomic position to illustrate the model’s ability to examine health burden from
an equity perspective.
Methods
This study was approved by the Ottawa Health Science Network Research Ethics Board (for-
merly the Ottawa Hospital Research Ethics Board). Data were accessed at the Institute for Clin-
ical Evaluative Sciences (Ontario data) and at Statistics Canada (national data).
The statistical plan was generated based on a previous study [16]. All exposures and out-
comes were prespecified based on consultation taking into consideration both science and pol-
icy perspectives. In addition, policy actors requested that the model be assessed for predictive
accuracy for a range of predetermined sociodemographic groups (see following sections). Anal-
yses that were added based on reviewers’ comments were the calculation of smoking-attribut-
able outcomes across sociodemographic groups. As well, we revised statistical confidence

 intervals to consider the combined error from health behaviour exposure ascertainment,
MPoRT risk estimation, and estimation of life expectancy using period life tables.
Study Data
Exposure data for this study were from the Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS)
cycles 1.1 (conducted in 2000–2001), 2.1 (2003–2004), 3.1 (2005–2006), 4.1 (2007–2008), and
5.1 (2009–2010) [17]. These surveys were used for three different purposes:
1. Derivation of the MPoRT algorithm—development of the algorithm with a focus on the
hazard of death from unhealthy behaviours, adjusted for sociodemographic risk factors.
2. Validation of the MPoRT algorithm—external validation of the algorithm using data that
are separate or distinct from the derivation data. Validation included assessment of the algo-
rithm in a wide range of predefined subgroups based on sociodemographic and health
behaviour characteristics.
3. Application of the MPoRT algorithm—a recent CCHS national data (2009–2010) was used
to estimate life expectancy lost due to unhealthy behaviours. Risk of death for each survey
respondent (whose data have not been linked to death certificates) was estimated using
MPoRT.
The CCHS surveys represented 98% of the Canadian population over 12 y of age and attained
an average response rate of 79.2%. The surveys were conducted through interviews by telephone
and in person, and all responses were self-reported. Each Health Region had approximately
2,000–3,000 respondents per survey (regardless of the size of the underlying population of the
region) to ensure sufficient power to provide Region-specific estimates. Excluded from the sam-
pling frame were people living on First Nation Reserves and Crown Lands, institutional residents,
and full-time members of the Canadian Forces. Households were selected through stratified mul-
tilevel cluster sampling of residences using local planning regions as the primary sampling unit.
Selection of respondents from households depended on the household composition and was
intended to increase the representation of the two age groups of special interest: youths and
seniors. The details of the survey methodology have been previously published [17].
The study (derivation, validation, and application data) was limited to respondents between
the ages of 20 and 99 y at the time of survey. The derivation and Ontario validation cohorts
only included those respondents who had agreed to have their survey linked to health adminis-
trative databases (derivation cohort = 80.2%). Respondents were included once; if respondents
participated in more than one survey cycle, the earliest record was retained. Respondents were
also excluded from the cohort if, at the time of the survey, they were not eligible for the provin-
cial health insurance program or they were pregnant (see also S1 Fig for study flow).
Derivation Cohort
Three cycles of the linked CCHS Ontario subsample (2003–2004, 2005–2006, and 2007–2008)
were combined to create a derivation cohort of respondents who were followed until death,
loss to follow-up, or March 31, 2013, whichever was earlier. All consenting respondents were
linked to the Registered Persons Database to ascertain deaths (>99.5% linkage rate to death
certificates)—see https://datadictionary.ices.on.ca for details.
Validation Cohorts
There were two validation cohorts, each with 5 y of follow-up. The first validation cohort was
composed of Ontario respondents of the earliest linked CCHS survey (2000–2001). The second

 validation cohort, which became available late in the study (after MPoRT model development),
was a preliminary linked national sample of 2003–2004 CCHS respondents, excluding Ontario
respondents as they formed part of the derivation cohort. All national CCHS respondents were
linked to death certificates using the Canadian Mortality Database (preliminary linkage: 0.04%
false positives and 3.46% false negatives).
Risk Factors for Death
We included the following pre-specified risk factors in the MPoRT algorithm: age, sex, four
health behaviours (smoking, alcohol consumption, physical activity, and diet; see Table 1),
sociodemographic factors (ethnicity, immigration status, and education), chronic conditions
(self-report of physician-diagnosed diabetes, coronary heart disease, stroke, and cancer), and
body mass index. We also included area-based measures: neighbourhood deprivation, local
planning region, and rurality.
We examined health behaviours as both categorical and continuous measures of exposure.
Continuous measures were assessed and preferentially included for two reasons: for improved
predictive performance (see below) [13,18,19], and to allow counterfactual examination of
small changes in population exposure [12,13].

 Smoking behaviour was described by combining separate questions about smoking status,
daily cigarette consumption, and past smoking behaviour. We categorized current smokers as
heavy or light smokers (see Table 1). Former smokers were also dichotomized as heavy or light
with a continuous measure of time since quitting (see S2 Fig). Alcohol drinking behaviour was
specified as heavy, moderate, and light/non using cut-points for daily alcohol consumption
and the presence of bingeing behaviour (see Table 1). Physical activity was included as a con-
tinuous measure (see S3 Fig) using average metabolic equivalent of task (MET) per day derived
from an aggregate list of leisure-time physical activities (frequency and duration) that were
examined in each survey.
Diet was included using an a priori approach that considered the possibility that different
dietary components could be either protective (fruit and vegetable and carrot consumption) or
harmful (high potato or fruit juice consumption) following dietary recommendations and
prior epidemiology studies [20–23]. The four CCHS dietary variables for weekly food intake
were combined into an index (the Perez Diet Score) based on the individual relationship with
mortality observed in previous studies using the CCHS linked data [8,24]. The index score var-
ied between 0 and 10, with points added for each frequency and serving of fruit or vegetables,
and points deducted for high potato consumption, no carrot consumption, or excessive juice
consumption (see Table 1).
Neighbourhood deprivation was developed using the Deprivation Index originally published
by Pampalon and Raymond [25]. The index, intended to serve as a proxy for individual-level
measures, categorizes the smallest geo-statistical units of the Canadian census (dissemination
areas) into two sets of quintile groups: one for the material components of deprivation (based
on average income, percent without high school graduation, and the employment ratio) and
the other for the social components (percent of single-parent families; percent of people living
alone; and percent of people divorced, widowed, or separated) [26]. In each quintile group, Q1
represents the 20% least deprived and Q5 represents the 20% most deprived. These quintiles
are cross-tabulated to create 25 distinct cells. Dissemination areas with material and social
combinations in the first and second quintiles (4 cells) were categorized as having low neigh-
bourhood deprivation. Dissemination areas with material and social combinations in the
fourth and fifth quintiles (4 cells) were categorized as having high neighbourhood deprivation.
All other dissemination areas were categorized as having moderate neighbourhood
deprivation.
Development of the MPoRT Algorithm
We used a Cox proportional hazards model to analyze time to death with 5 y risk of death as
the outcome of interest. We then converted the proportional hazards model to generate the
MPoRT risk algorithm, using the baseline risk and beta coefficients directly from the model.
We sought to develop a predictive algorithm that was both well calibrated and discriminating,
with an emphasis on calibration for behavioural risk factors and use in the community setting
[27]. Calibration reflects an algorithm’s ability to produce predictive estimates that closely
approximate observed risk [28].
We included age as a continuous time-dependent variable to account for potential violations
of the proportional hazards assumption and for the non-linear increase of death hazard in
older ages. Multicollinearity was assessed using the approach described by Sarle and Hoeffding
[29,30]. We derived separate models for males and females.
Age and health behaviours were the primary predictors of interest and formed the base
model. We modeled mortality as a function of age using spline functions. Additional sociode-
mographic, intermediate (body mass index), and proximal (chronic diseases) risk factors were

 added to improve calibration [31]. We predefined explicit criteria for choosing these risk fac-
tors and added them only if they met the criteria. First, we identified important subgroups and
target populations through a structured consultation process with policy actors. This process
considered all behavioural risk exposures, age groups, health planning regions, sociodemo-
graphic groups, body mass index, and chronic disease status. Next, the policy actors identified
a 20% difference between the predicted and observed risk as “clinically important” for policy
and planning. We therefore added a risk factor if, in the absence of that factor, the model had a
greater than 20% difference between the predicted and observed risk. We only assessed sub-
groups that represented more than 5% of total deaths. To determine the model’s discrimina-
tion—its ability to differentiate individuals at high risk from those at low risk [28]—we used
the C-statistic and 90:10 risk percentile ratios for survival data with time-dependent covariates
[32].
We examined interactions between age and behavioural risk factors. Only respondents with
complete records were included in analyses because missing values were infrequent (less than
5% for each of the variables under consideration) and we intended to apply the algorithm to
similar population health data with infrequent missing data [33]. Further details of the expo-
sure variables are provided in S1 Table.
Validation of Predictive Accuracy and Assessment of Risk Hazards
This study applied MPoRT in two ways: to estimate the baseline risk of mortality and to esti-
mate the attribution of health behaviours to mortality (life expectancy lost). To assess the pre-
dictive accuracy of baseline risk we examined the C-statistic and measures of calibration
(observed versus predicted risk estimates in the two validation cohorts). Attribution of health
behaviours was calculated by combining baseline risk with hazard ratios of the behavioural risk
factors. We assessed the health behaviour hazard ratios within the development data as well as
the national sample of CCHS (which included all provinces) by comparing the full model (age,
health behaviours, sociodemographic indicators, and chronic conditions) to two alternative
models: (1) age and health behaviours only, and (2) full model without the first 2 y of follow-
up to allow for potential healthy respondent effect.
Calculating Mortality Burden of Health Behaviour Risk in Canada 2009–
2010
Mortality burden from unhealthy behaviours was defined as the difference between the baseline
mortality risk (i.e., the mortality risk of the population based on current exposure patterns)
and the healthy reference mortality risk. Baseline mortality risk was defined as mortality risk
calculated using MPoRT for each CCHS respondent based on their reported health behaviours
and other predictive risks. Healthy reference mortality risk was defined as the MPoRT-calcu-
lated mortality risk assuming respondents had an exposure that was at the reference or healthy
level. For example, to calculate smoking-deleted mortality, we assumed all respondents, includ-
ing current and former smokers, were non-smokers. The mortality burden of smoking was the
difference between the baseline (actual) risk and the new healthy reference exposure. The pro-
cedure was repeated for physical activity (all respondents with less than 3 METs/day of leisure-
time physical activity were recoded to have 3 METs/day, corresponding to recommendations
in the Canadian physical activity guidelines [34]), diet (all respondents with a diet score of less
than 8 were recoded to have a diet score of 8, corresponding to recommendations in Canada’s
Food Guide [35]), and alcohol (heavy drinkers were recoded to light/non-drinker). The com-
bined burden of the four unhealthy behaviours was estimated by assuming all respondents
were in the healthy reference category for all four behaviours.

 Prior to performing burden estimates, we calibrated the MPoRT algorithm by comparing
the predicted 1 y risk of death for the Canadian CCHS 2009–2010 respondents to Canadian
observed mortality rates (average 2010 and 2011), by sex and age [36]. The difference in the
observed and predicted risk was used as an external unlinked calibration coefficient αeuc
(age, sex)
that was applied to the risk α from the MPoRT algorithm where αeuc
(age, sex) is α x O(age, sex)/
P(age, sex). We used survey weights provided by Statistics Canada to account for survey design.
Confidence intervals and standard error for predicted mortality were calculated using the
bootstrap approach of Kovacevic et al. for out-of-sample prediction with population health
surveys [37]. These confidence intervals combined two sources of uncertainty: MPoRT model
parameters and exposure variability (CCHS 2012). Confidence intervals for life expectancy
were calculated using the approach of Chiang and the variances estimates for mortality, as
described above [38]. See S1 Text for more details.
Calculating Life Expectancy Lost from Unhealthy Behaviours in Canada
2009–2010
We calculated life expectancy lost from unhealthy behaviours using a cause-deleted period life
table approach [39,40]. Similar to the approach for mortality burden, life expectancy lost was
the difference between baseline life expectancy and healthy reference life expectancy.
National statistical agencies and the World Health Organization calculate life expectancy by
generating period life tables using age- and sex-specific mortality rates for a specific period
(e.g., 2009–2010), which are converted to age- and sex-specific mortality risk. This approach
assumes a stationary population, meaning mortality rates for a specific period are applied over
the entire life time (the stationary population). Burden of disease studies typically use these
same age- and sex-specific life tables but delete risk-factor–attributable deaths. Life expectancy
is then re-estimated with these cause-deleted mortality rates to generate a cause-deleted life
expectancy.
We used the same approach as a typical period life table, but we used MPoRT-predicted
mortality risk (i.e., multivariable predicted risk) for each CCHS respondent, instead of starting
with observed age- and sex-specific mortality rates. Following, we generated weighted sex-spe-
cific 5 y abridged period life tables (20 to 99 y of age) [38]. These life tables were used to gener-
ate baseline life expectancy, which corresponds to baseline mortality risk (described above).
Similarly, healthy reference life expectancy was generated using life tables with healthy refer-
ence mortality risk, as described in the previous section.
After calculating mortality risk for each CCHS respondent, it was straightforward to gener-
ate life tables for a wide range of health profiles (e.g., by smoking status or socioeconomic posi-
tion) by aggregating MPoRT mortality risk and the corresponding profile.
Calculating Life Expectancy for Different Health Behaviour Profiles in
Canada 2009–2010
Canadian life expectancies were calculated for healthy and unhealthy risk profiles using the
2009–2010 CCHS. The healthy profile was defined as non-smoking; moderate, light, or non-
drinking (men: 0 to 21 drinks/week; women: 0 to 14 drinks/week); active (�3 METs/day); and
consuming a high-quality diet (diet score �8). The unhealthy profile was defined as heavy
smoking; heavy drinking (men: >21 drinks/week or weekly binge drinking; women: >14
drinks/week or weekly binge drinking); inactive (<1.5 METs/day); and with poor diet quality
(diet score <2).

 Results
The final derivation cohort had 77,399 respondents (0.2% were lost to follow-up). Within the
598,913 person-years of follow-up (median time: 7.6 y), 6,142 deaths were observed, of which
2,953 occurred in males and 3,189 in females. The Ontario validation cohort had 24,729 respon-
dents (127,403 person-years of follow-up; 1,383 deaths) and the Canadian validation cohort had
56,215 respondents (275,468 person-years of follow-up; 2,375 deaths). The application cohort of
89,984 respondents represented 25.3 million Canadians after applying survey weights.
Details of the characteristics of the derivation, validation, and application cohorts are pre-
sented in Table 2 and Table 3. Generally, health behaviours improved slowly over time. For
example, there is a reduction in the prevalence of heavy smokers and of high potato and fruit
juice consumption. Similarly, there was an improvement in socioeconomic status with an
increase in post-secondary education. Table 4 shows the crude and age-standardized mortality
rates for health behaviour risks (see S2 Table to S4 Table for crude and age-standardized mor-
tality rates by other exposure variables). Heavy smokers had the highest age-standardized mor-
tality rate per 10,000 person-years: 196.8 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 161.8, 237.1) for males
and 193.8 (95% CI: 162.8, 229.0) for females. The most favourable health behaviour exposures
had the lowest mortality rates for all exposures (range per 10,000 person-years: for men, 67.4 to
73.9 and for women, 60.3 to 69.9).
S5 Table and S6 Table describe the characteristics of the multivariable risk model for males
and females respectively. Discrimination of all models was high for both males and females (C-
statistic in the final model: 0.874 [95% CI: 0.867–0.881] and 0.875 [0.868–0.882], respectively).
Using age and behaviours as the only predictors, 6 of 58 predefined subgroups for each of male
and female cohorts showed greater than 20% difference between the predicted and observed
deaths. Calibration improved with the addition of sociodemographic and disease indicators,
with observed and predicted deaths in none of the 58 subgroups showing greater than 20% dif-
ference for each sex. Fig 1 illustrates the close approximation between predicted and observed
deaths by risk decile.
Generally, there was a small attenuation of health behaviour hazards when sociodemo-
graphic and disease exposures were added to the model. For example, the male hazard ratio for
heavy smoking decreased from 3.01 in the initial model (age and health behaviours only) to
2.83 in the full model (fully specified). Removing the first 2 y of study observation (sensitivity
analysis) resulted in slight increases in health behaviour hazards except for physical activity, in
which the hazard ratios were slightly attenuated.
Evaluation of MPoRT Using Validation Data
The C-statistic in the Ontario validation cohort was 0.877 for males (95% CI: 0.864–0.889) and
0.882 for females (0.871–0.893). In the Canadian validation cohort, the C-statistic was 0.872 for
males (95% CI: 0.865–0.879) and 0.883 for females (0.876–0.889). Fig 1 shows close approxima-
tion between observed and predicted risks for both validation cohorts. S5 Table and S6 Table
show that risk factor hazard ratios were similar for most behavioural factors and other exposures
when examined using the national validation cohort. In general, there was slight attenuation of
smoking hazard ratios (for heavy smoking, the hazard ratio decreased from 2.83 to 2.81 for males
and 3.26 to 3.00 for females); however, the other behavioural factors showed slight increases. S4
Fig and S5 Fig show good calibration of the behaviour subgroups in the Ontario validation
cohorts. For the national validation cohorts, there was modest over-prediction in females for
most behaviour subgroups; however, calibration remained robust for males (S4 Fig and S5 Fig).

 MPoRT was 79.0 y for males and 83.6 y for females; after re-calibration the predicted and
observed life expectancy was 79.3 [males] and 83.4 [females] years). For the 2010 Canadian
population, unhealthy-behaviour–attributable life expectancy lost was 6.0 y for both men and
women (for men 95% CI: 5.8 to 6.3 for women 5.8 to 6.2). This estimate represents the estimate
period life expectancy if there were no exposure to smoking, physical inactivity, poor diet, or
unhealthy alcohol consumption. Canadian female unhealthy-behaviour–attributable life expec-
tancy lost was also 6.0 y higher (95% CI: 5.8–6.2) (89.3 y, up from 83.4 y). In 2010, there were
189,000 deaths (males and females combined), of which the four unhealthy behaviours

 attributed 94,400 deaths (49.8% [95% CI: 48.5–50.4]). Smoking was the leading risk factor for
males (smoking-attributable life expectancy loss of 3.1 y), and physical inactivity was the lead-
ing risk factor for females (physical inactivity attributable life expectancy loss of 3.0 y). Due to
its lower risk hazard, diet had a smaller burden on life expectancy compared to smoking and
physical inactivity. Excess alcohol had a small attribution to mortality and life expectancy lost.
Fig 3 shows the life expectancy of people associated with a healthy reference exposure and
exposure to all four unhealthy behaviours. For males, there was a 16.8 y life expectancy differ-
ence (86.1 versus 69.3 y). For females, there was an 18.9 y life expectancy difference (90.2 versus
71.3 y).

 neighbourhood deprivation, but these estimates could be calculated for other socioeconomic
exposures measured in the CCHS and for any combination of behavioural risk factors. Life
expectancy for different social groups varied more for men than women (e.g., a 5.4 y difference
in life expectancy between men with post-secondary education compared to less than high
school education; for women this difference was 3.3 y). Smoking was associated with approxi-
mately 41% of the difference in life expectancy across education levels for men and 36% for
women. After deleting smoking as a cause of death, life expectancy remained lowest for men
and women with less than high school education, a reflection of unhealthy exposure to other
risk factors.
Discussion
Our study estimated the burden of unhealthy behaviours in Canada using a multivariable pre-
dictive approach and the newly developed MPoRT algorithm. We developed the MPoRT algo-
rithm using community health survey data individually linked to death records. We then
applied the algorithm to Canada’s a recent population health survey and calculated mortality
risk for each respondent.
Four unhealthy behaviours: smoking, physical inactivity, poor diet, and unhealthy alcohol
consumption attributed 50% of deaths in Canada, equivalent to approximately 6 y of life expec-
tancy lost. Smoking was the leading unhealthy behaviour contributing to deaths for men,
despite a prevalence that continues to decrease in Canada (22% of Canadians were current

 smokers in 2010). The burdens from poor diet and physical inactivity closely follow, reflecting
the high prevalence of Canadians who report unfavourable exposure to these risk factors. The
burden of excess alcohol was small, which was a reflection of a low prevalence of heavy drink-
ing except at younger ages, where baseline mortality risk is low.
Our study offers two main contributions to measuring the burden from unhealthy behav-
iours. First is the development of a population-based all-cause mortality risk algorithm focus-
ing on health behaviours. Mortality risk algorithms are uncommonly developed and, to our
knowledge, MPoRT is the only mortality risk algorithm based on a population health survey
and/or behavioural risk factors [43]. MPoRT had very good predictive accuracy with high dis-
crimination (the ability to distinguish between people at high and low risk). Second, this study
showed that it is feasible to estimate the burden of unhealthy behaviours using a multivariable
risk algorithm that offers flexibility for novel uses. In the process, we demonstrated that mortal-
ity risk can be used to calculate a range of intuitive measures such as overall life expectancy and
life expectancy for people with different health and sociodemographic profiles. Attribution
measures include attributable life expectancy lost and total mortality.
Use in Different Population Settings
Population health surveys are available in many countries, and an increasing number of coun-
tries are able to link these surveys to death certificates. These linked surveys provide the oppor-
tunity for a more comprehensive assessment of MPoRT’s predictive accuracy in those

 countries [44,45]. However, MPoRT can also be used in settings without linked population
health surveys.
When used in a new setting, a predictive algorithm such as MPoRT should meet two crite-
ria: discrimination and calibration (accuracy). We expect that MPoRT will have high discrimi-
nation in other populations. Typically, discrimination erodes when an algorithm is validated in
new populations, but we found that MPoRT’s discrimination remained high (and was slightly
higher for women) in the national Canadian validation cohort compared to the provincial
Ontario derivation cohort. This likely reflects a more heterogeneous distribution of mortality
risk in the national population, as well as the strong influence of health behaviours and other
included risk factors on all-cause mortality.
While discrimination often translates from development to application, the same cannot be
said of calibration; this can be seen in the clinical setting, where risk algorithms have been
largely developed and used [46,47]. An algorithm is considered to be well calibrated if predicted

 risk closely approximates observed risk, and good calibration of baseline risk is especially
important for population health research [48]. Fortunately, unlike in the clinical setting,
straightforward opportunities are available to re-calibrate population risk algorithms, as dem-
onstrated in our study [36].
Prior to use in other settings, MPoRT will require an assessment of calibration; our recom-
mendation is to re-calibrate it for most settings. In our study, MPoRT maintained very good
calibration when we applied it to a recent national survey data (predicted risk and observed
mortality were almost equal). As an illustration of the process that would be required in other
settings, we re-calibrated the age- and sex-specific predicted risk to the observed deaths in the
new population (Canada) [36]. Additional re-calibration for risk factor exposure can be per-
formed by centering risks on the distribution of risk exposure in the target population. The
need for re-calibration would not indicate that MPoRT has poor predictive accuracy; rather, it
would signal that factors beyond those included in MPoRT are influencing baseline risk in the
new population. Re-calibration adjusts for these factors—conserving the purpose of MPoRT to
discriminate risk based on health behaviours (smoking, alcohol, diet, and exercise).
Comparison with Existing Approaches
The multivariable predictive approach combines characteristics of the two leading methods of
estimating burden of health behaviours—aggregated data and population cohort approaches—
and builds on them to provide the potential for a range of uses. The aggregated data approach
is useful because it combines three data elements that are commonly available in many settings:
incidence of outcomes, prevalence of risk factor exposure, and hazard ratios summarizing the
association between risk factors and outcomes. Similarly, the multivariable predictive approach
disaggregates the task of estimating burden into three data elements that are then combined
(Fig 4 and S9 Table provide additional comparison of the three approaches).
Outcomes
Rather than using aggregated outcome data (deaths), we calculated the baseline risk of death by
applying MPoRT to individual respondents of a population health survey. Unlike the cohort
approach, which attributes health behaviour to death within a closed historic population, the
aggregated data approach can be applied to observed deaths in external populations, making it
widely amenable for the multicountry burden of disease studies and similar research [2,5]. The
multivariable predictive approach also uses observed mortality rates, to ensure predicted mor-
tality equals observed mortality.
We examined all-cause mortality, whereas the Global Burden of Disease study assessed dis-
ease-specific mortality and then aggregated that information across health behaviours to calcu-
late total burden of health behaviour risks. Examining all-cause mortality typically results in
higher burden estimates compared to burden estimated using specific causes when the expo-
sures (in this case, unhealthy behaviours) affect health in many ways. This is the main reason
why smoking-attributable deaths are higher in our study (26% of all deaths) than in the World
Health Organization’s report (23% of all deaths), which examined only 15 causes of death [49].
There are increasing recommendations to consider all-cause mortality for smoking because, as
the United States Surgeon General has stated, “Smoking impacts nearly every organ of the
body” [50]. That said, it is feasible to use disease-specific risk predictive algorithms developed
for population data [51,52]. As well, risk algorithms can be used for other outcomes, such as
health care cost [24,53].

 Exposures
As noted in our Introduction, all three approaches use population-based health surveys to esti-
mate population exposure to different health behaviours. The aggregated data approach uses
aggregate estimates of exposure, whereas the cohort and multivariable predictive approach esti-
mate exposure at the individual level—allowing for a range of methods to examine and adjust for
how health behaviours are correlated. In addition, we use the same individual-level data to both
predict outcomes and consider interactions between health behaviours and other factors, such as
social determinants of health. Population-based surveys are a well-suited starting point for mea-
suring health behaviours from an equity perspective because these surveys typically include
sociodemographic questions such as education, work history, income, ethnicity, and immigrant
status. Furthermore, the burden of low socioeconomic position can be estimated using the same
approach that we used to estimate the burden from behavioural risks. Using individual-level data

 to examine the combined effect of socioeconomic position and health behaviours allows consid-
eration of clustering or collinearity with fewer assumptions than use of aggregate data.
Hazard Ratios
It is in the final of the three data components, namely risk factor hazard ratios, where the mul-
tivariable predictive approach straddles the other two approaches and further demonstrates its
flexibility. An underlying assumption for all approaches is that burden estimates for beha-
vioural risks reflect a causal understanding of those risks. The multivariable predictive
approach can use estimated hazard ratios from any source, whether “within study” (i.e., from
the same study data) or from other studies. Ascertaining relative risks or hazards separately (as
in the aggregated data approach) has the potential advantage of being more generalizable
across settings, especially when risk estimates are derived from meta-analyses or pooled cohort
studies that focus specifically on assessing causal relationships.
We performed burden estimates using a single model, meaning we used MPoRT for both
predictive and associative purposes (i.e., to estimate both baseline mortality risk and attribut-
able burden from behavioural risks). However, it is also entirely reasonable to use MPoRT
solely for the purpose of estimating the baseline risk of mortality and then to use behavioural
risk hazards calculated from the same population health surveys, but specified for causal pur-
poses. For transparency, we present hazard ratios from four alternative models with varying
degrees of adjustment for confounding and inclusion of mediating risks (exposures that are on
the pathway between health behaviours and mortality, such as body mass index and diabetes).
We found that the hazard ratios for health behaviours were attenuated only slightly by the
addition of potential confounders and mediators. This suggests that the model has appropriate
specification and the burden estimates are robust. That said, it could be argued that using haz-
ard ratios from a model with mediators resulted in over-adjustment and subsequent under-
estimation of burden, and that we should have calculated burden using hazard ratios from our
model, which did not include mediators (see S5 Table and S6 Table). Similarly, it was possible
to generate burden estimates without adjusting for sociodemographic factors (our first model)
or to estimate the burden of sociodemographic factors using hazards for sociodemographic fac-
tors. New mediation analyses are being developed that will allow further flexibility when esti-
mating burden from health behaviours [54].
Nonetheless, the “within study” hazard ratio estimates we used had the same magnitude,
dose-response, and rank order as hazard ratios from other studies and reviews that examined
unhealthy behaviours from a causal perspective. Furthermore, as opposed to hazard ratios from
external sources, the use of unhealthy behaviour hazards had the advantage of consistent ascer-
tainment throughout the burden calculation, which has been shown to have an important influ-
ence on burden estimates [14,55]. Additionally, we were able to include age interaction and
ascertain risk with greater specificity (e.g., physical activity as a continuous measure [METs]
instead of the more common approach of measuring using three or four activity levels). Greater
specificity of risk exposures allowed us to examine specific population targets, recommendations,
or counterfactual burden estimates that considered small changes in risk exposure.
Time
The three approaches to measure burden of unhealthy living have different time perspectives:
the cohort approach has a historic perspective, the aggregated data approach has a recent or
current perspective, and the multivariable predictive risk approach has a current or future per-
spective (see Fig 4). The historic cohort perspective reflects singular use of historical cohort
data. The aggregated data approach answers the question: “What is the health behaviour
Measuring Burden of Unhealthy Behaviours Using a Multivariable Predictive Approach

 attribution of current deaths, based on past health behaviours?” That said, the calculations usu-
ally combine current health behaviours with current health outcomes—disregarding the lag
time between health behaviour exposure and many chronic disease outcomes [14]. The unique
future perspective of the multivariable predictive approach answers the question: “Based on
current health behaviours, what is the future risk of death?”
Life expectancy, a summary measure of mortality, is a related time concept. All three
approaches are used to estimate period life expectancy—the main measure used in this study.
Period life expectancy (also known as actuarial life expectancy), is calculated using “period,” or
cross-sectional, mortality and holds an assumption of a stationary population, meaning mor-
tality patterns do not change over time [38]. Period life expectancy should not be confused
with cohort life expectancy. For population purposes, cohort life expectancy is typically calcu-
lated after everyone in the cohort dies and, therefore, is calculated for historic birth cohorts
(for examples, see The Human Mortality Database) [56].
The population cohort and multivariable predictive approaches can estimate closed-cohort
mortality risk; for example, MPoRT can be used to estimate 5 y age-specific mortality risk. An
advantage of the multivariable predictive approach is the ability to estimate the future risk of
mortality based on current health behaviours. The future health perspective is helpful for
examining the potential effectiveness of preventive scenarios [8].
Advantages of Using Individual Exposure Data
We argue that the multivariable predictive approach offers flexibility and transparency when
calculating population burden. In addition to its limited ability to incorporate differences in
risk by sociodemographic status, the aggregated data approach also has challenges addressing
the joint distribution of risks, risk interactions, future perspective, and lag-time between expo-
sures and outcomes. For the most part, these challenges arise because the aggregated data
approach is macro- or cell-based as opposed to micro-based (using individual exposure data).
For example, aggregated outcome data from vital statistics typically lack information about
socioeconomic position or individual health behaviours. Deaths can be grouped by socioeco-
nomic neighbourhood and then ecologic burden estimates can be replicated for each aggre-
gated subpopulation [57]. However, this approach is not feasible in many jurisdictions.
Furthermore, the multivariable predictive approach allows for examination and estimation of
interactions between socioeconomic status, health behaviours, and mortality in ways that are
not possible using ecologic, aggregated data [58]. In an era of more readily available micro-data
(including so-called “big data”), we should move beyond an approach to burden estimates that
has remained largely unchanged for the past 60 y [8].
Limitations
There are several limitations in both the multivariable predictive approach and the develop-
ment and application of MPoRT. Measuring risk using population health surveys has inherent
limitations because these surveys are usually cross-sectional, telephone-based, self-reported
and cover a wide range of topics that allow only brief ascertainment of any particular risk expo-
sure. That stated, the ascertainment of prevalence of behavioural risk factors in population
health surveys has become more consistent across countries and there is an increasing number
of validation studies that indicate acceptable ascertainment bias [59]. Diet and alcohol are
exceptions. For diet, there is considerable variation in ascertainment across population health
surveys and few validation studies on brief ascertainment of diet. In the Canadian Community
Health Survey (used to develop and apply MPoRT), diet was ascertained using fewer questions
(five brief questions on fruit and vegetable intake) than is typical in population health surveys.

 The questions were converted to a scale of dietary quality shown in previous studies to be
related to both mortality and hospital use [16,24]. It is likely that this brief dietary score under-
estimated burden from diet compared to other, more detailed diet exposure measures [60]. For
alcohol, there is consistent under-ascertainment of consumption in most population health
surveys. In Ontario the sum of self-reported alcohol consumption is about half the volume of
alcohol sold [61]. It is possible to revise alcohol and other health behaviour exposures to adjust
for misascertainment bias. Adjustment can be made through various multivariable imputation
techniques that consider differential bias across socioeconomic position and other risk factors,
whereas the aggregate method adjusts at the aggregate level [62–64]. Calibration of the burden
outcome should be performed after adjusting exposure for misascertainment bias to ensure an
unbiased overall burden estimate (as described above).
Calculating confidence or uncertainty intervals for burden studies is challenging because
there are several sources of error. We calculated confidence intervals for burden estimates that
considered stochastic error. We found the confidence intervals were small, reflecting the large
sample size of the study data. The confidence intervals would be much larger had we adjusted
for more sources of measurement error, including from survey sampling, exposure measure-
ment, or model specification. In general, adjusting for bias from each of these errors will result
in larger estimates of burden from unhealthy behaviours: survey sampling usually biases
towards selecting healthy people; misclassification of health behaviours and behavioural haz-
ards from an over-fitted survival model will result in conservative burden estimates. New
methods are increasingly available to estimate uncertainty and adjust for bias, particularly for a
multivariable predictive approach that uses individual-level data [65].
This study does not consider time-varying exposure or exposure mediation (other than sen-
sitivity analyses of potential mediators). Murray et al. consider these issues in their conceptual
framework for assessing risk factors, and recent advances have included marginal structural
models and g-estimation when time-varying exposure is measured in longitudinal cohorts
[66–68]. Unfortunately, population health surveys rarely incorporate longitudinal follow-up of
exposures and, therefore, time-varying exposure is not considered in commonly used
approaches to measuring burden, including the Global Burden of Disease study.
Conclusions
Population health surveys are commonly conducted in many countries and can provide the
basis of determining health behaviour exposure for burden of disease reporting. Increasingly,
these surveys are linked to death and disease outcomes data. These linked health surveys create
an opportunity to model burden of disease using individual-based approaches, such as the mul-
tivariable predictive approach, or to supplement existing attributable burden approaches. We
show that a multivariable predictive approach to estimating burden from unhealthy behaviours
is feasible and demonstrates a large burden of life expectancy lost in Canada. Lastly, we show
that differential exposure to unhealthy behaviours contributes to large differences in the bur-
den of mortality across socioeconomic groups.
