repens): an infection spreading throughout
the old world

Abstract
Background: Two main Dirofilaria species infect dogs: D. immitis and D. repens. While D. immitis has a worldwide
distribution, D. repens is currently found only in Europe, Asia, and Africa. Adult D. repens are located in subcutaneous
tissues of natural hosts where they survive for long periods of time. First-stage larvae, microfilariae, circulate in the
peripheral bloodstream, where they are taken up by the mosquito intermediate hosts. Infected mosquitoes then
transmit infective third-stage (L3) larvae to new hosts through the blood meal. In dogs, most infections are
asymptomatic, although cutaneous disorders such as pruritus, dermal swelling, subcutaneous nodules, and ocular
conjunctivitis can be observed. Currently, two factors have increased the concerns about this parasitic infection 1) its
spread throughout the European countries and to other continents and its prevalence in dog populations, where in
some cases it has overcome D. immitis; and 2) its zoonotic potential, which is much greater than that of D. immitis.
Results: Different hypotheses can be put forward to explain these concerns. First, climate change has allowed more
favorable conditions for survival of culicid vectors. Second, accidental hosts such as humans may have a less efficient
immune reaction against a parasite that is located in subcutaneous tissues, and thus less exposed to the host’s immune
response than, for instance, D. immitis. Furthermore, the absence of clinical signs in the majority of canine infections and
the difficulty in diagnosing the infection, due to the lack of serologic tests and thus the reliance on the identification of
microfilariae and differentiation from D. immitis to confirm the presence of the parasite, favor the further spread of this
species. Finally, among the macrocyclic lactones currently used to prevent heartworm infection, only moxidectin has
been found to be fully effective against the infective larvae transmitted by mosquitoes and partially effective (efficacy
96%) against adult D. repens in experimental studies.
Conclusions: Dirofilaria repens infection is much more difficult than D. immitis to diagnose and control in the reservoir
population (microfilaremic dogs). In addition, lack of familiarity with D. repens infection could lead to lack of vigilance
underestimation for this parasite. The number of human cases in Europe and Asia is currently a serious public health
concern. Medical doctors and veterinarians must collaborate closely for better control and surveillance of D. repens
infection.

 Background
Dirofilarial infections are vector-borne parasitic diseases
mainly of dogs, cats, and wild carnivores caused by Dirofi-
laria (Noctiella) repens and D. immitis. D. repens is
endemic in many countries of the Old World but has not
yet been found in the Americas (reports from Brazil and
Peru [1, 2] are doubtful and need confirmation), while D.
immitis infections have a worldwide distribution [3]. The
two parasites were confused for many years and it was
assumed that D. immitis worms could be found both in
the pulmonary artery and in subcutaneous tissues. In
1910, Bonvicini [4], an Italian scientist, while studying the
effect of essential turpentine oil against what he supposed
were heartworms, recovered some adult worms from
subcutaneous tissues of a necropsied dog and sent them
to Raillet and Henry in Lyon (France), who subsequently
described and named the species D. repens [5]. Nonethe-
less, the first observation of D. repens was probably from a
human being. In 1566, a Portuguese medical doctor,
Amato Lusitano, reported in his Curationum Medicina-
lium Centuriae: “puella trima … per oculi internam par-
tem, quam angulum magnum appellamus, a jumbrici
cuiusdamcaput appere coepis…” (in a three-year-old girl,
suddenly it started to appear in the area we call big angle
of the eye the tip of one worm which sometimes are sited
in the eye making its opacity) [6].
D. repens has a long pre-patent period (170–238 days)
[7], although in a recent experimental study the first
microfilariae were found in the bloodstream on day 164
post infection [8]. Infective larvae migrate throughout
the subcutaneous tissue and muscular connective fa-
sciae, where they develop to the adult stage and reside
permanently. Adult worms and microfilariae are long-
living parasites in their natural hosts (about 4 years).
The parasite, like other filarioids, harbors an endosymbi-
ont bacterium (Wolbachia) that plays a significant role
in desensitization of host innate immunity, assuring the
worms’ long-term survival [9]. Interestingly, no inflam-
matory reaction or connective tissue capsule surrounds
the living parasite, which can be seen moving actively
under the connective serous layers [8, 10]. In most cases,
including experimental infections, the infection goes
unnoticed (no clinical signs) [8, 10]. Occasionally, cuta-
neous disorders such as pruritus, dermal swelling, sub-
cutaneous nodules containing the parasite, and ocular
conjunctivitis can be observed [11]. Allergic reactions
likely due to microfilaria sensitization and Wolbachia-
mediated inflammatory reactions in severe infections
have been reported [12]. In these cases, circulating
microfilariae often are absent.
Canine infections
Infected dogs are the main reservoir of D. repens infection
as they frequently have microfilariae in the peripheral
blood. Since the early 1900s, canine D. repens infection
has been reported as endemic in central and southern
Italy and in other southern European countries, such as
France, Greece, and the former Yugoslavia [13]. Several
factors have contributed to the spread of canine D. repens
infection. The introduction of the Pet Travel Scheme in
2000 allowed easier movement of companion animals
throughout the European Union [14]. Rising temperatures
have resulted in the spread throughout Europe of the
Asian tiger mosquito (Aedes albopictus) and other compe-
tent vector species such as Ae. koreicus [15]. Currently
new endemic areas have been identified and confirmed in
Austria, Czech Republic, Germany, Hungary, Poland,
Russia,
Ukraine,
Slovakia,
Turkey,
and
the
Balkan
Peninsula (Albania, Bosnia, Bulgaria, Croatia, Greece,
Macedonia,
Romania,
Serbia)
[16–19].
It
is
note-
worthy that in several eastern European countries D.
repens
prevalence
is
higher
than
D.
immitis:
for
example, in Romania, where the heartworm preva-
lence ranges 02% to 2% and the D. repens prevalence
range is from 7% to 20% [20–22].
Human infections
Humans can be accidental hosts for both D. immitis and
D. repens. Comparing the data of zoonotic infections
caused by D. immitis in the United States and Japan with
that observed in Europe in recent years, however, the
figures are surprisingly different. Approximately 110
human cases of D. immitis have been reported in the US
in the last 50 years [23, 24] and 277 cases in the last
39 years in Japan [25], while in Europe about 25 cases
have been reported in the last 37 years [26–28]. It is
noteworthy that the prevalence of canine heartworm
infection in endemic areas of the US, Japan, and
Europe is essentially the same (12% to 60% in dogs
not given preventives). For D. repens, more than 3500
human cases were reported in Europe from 1977 to
2016 [13, 16, 29–32]. Furthermore, three cases have
been described in the US in individuals who acquired the
infection during travel to Italy, Greece, and Africa [33–35].
The question is why does D. repens have such a high
zoonotic potential in comparison with D. immitis?
Dirofilaria immitis vs Dirofilaria repens: Why such a
difference in the prevalence of human infections?
Currently, there is no evidence indicating the existence
of a more virulent D. immitis strain in the Americas
than in Europe, although recently genetic differences
have been observed in worms from human ocular infec-
tions both in the Americas and Europe [36, 37], suggest-
ing
the
existence
of
a
closely
related
species
of
Dirofilaria [38]. Concerning D. repens, while a clear
genetic difference has been found among D. repens–like
worms from Asia (India and Thailand) and between the
The Author(s) Parasites & Vectors 2017, 10(Suppl 2):517
Page 2 of 235
 Asian and the European samples, the genetic variability
within the European samples is rather low [39].
One hypothesis to justify such a difference in the
zoonotic potential between the two species could be a
consequence of an unidentified factor related to the
vector. Both D. immitis and D. repens, however, are
able to grow in the same mosquito species and at the
same
temperature
and
humidity
under
laboratory
conditions. In addition, both species have the same
developmental time from the microfilarial stage to the
infective larva [7, 17]. Recently, D. repens larvae have
been identified in Anopheles maculipennis and Aedes
vexans from Slovakia and Austria [40, 41] and both
D. immitis and D. repens in Culex pipiens from
Germany and Italy [42, 43]. These mosquito species
are well known as competent vectors for D. immitis
[42]. Therefore, other factors must play a role in the
difference in the risk of zoonotic infections between
the two species.
In humans, once D. repens infective larvae are trans-
mitted by an infected mosquito, in most cases the para-
site is found in subcutaneous nodules or in the ocular
conjunctiva, apparently near the points of infected
mosquito bites [13], although some lung and tumor-like
infections have been reported [44–46]. In most cases,
the parasite is not able to develop to the sexually mature
adult stage and infection is characterized by the presence
of pre-adult worms, although at least four cases of
microfilaremic zoonotic infections have been reported in
Europe and Asia [16, 47]. We can hypothesize that it is
much easier for a parasite located in subcutaneous tis-
sues to escape the natural resistance (immune response)
of unusual hosts, such as humans, than for D. immitis
larvae that migrate within deep tissues where they could
be killed by the immune system of the host [48].
Most canine D. repens infections are subclinical or the
clinical signs are nonspecific, and most infections go un-
diagnosed. Furthermore, while several antigen test kits
with high sensitivity and specificity are available for the
serologic diagnosis of heartworm infection, no serologic
test is available for D. repens. This also makes the diag-
nosis of occult infections, despite clinical suspicion,
nearly impossible [49]. It is noteworthy that the lack of
cross-reaction between D. repens and D. immitis [50] is
due to the localization of the two parasites (subcutis and
bloodstream, respectively) rather than to the specificity
of the tests. The heat treatment of serum recently sug-
gested to increase the test sensitivity [51] may increase
the risk of cross-reactions between the two Dirofilaria
species [52]. Examination of the blood for circulating
microfilariae is strongly suggested for both Dirofilaria
infections, but this is the only method of D. repens diag-
nosis. Many veterinarians, however, are not familiar with
the Knott test, which allows for
visualization and
identification of microfilariae, particularly those in areas
where the parasite has only been recently introduced.
Prevention and adulticide treatment
The efficacy of the macrocyclic lactones (ML) currently
used to prevent D. immitis patent infections (ivermectin,
milbemycin oxime, moxidectin, and selamectin) was
assessed in several experimental laboratory studies and
in field studies [3] and all were considered fully effective
until the emergence of ML resistance in the United
States [53]. No report of resistance has yet been
published in Europe. Preventive efficacy against D.
repens has been evaluated only for the oral ivermectin
formulation at 6 μg/kg and 12 μg/kg [54] and both the
injectable moxidectin formulation at 0.17 mg/kg and the
topical moxidectin formulation at 2.5 mg/kg (in combin-
ation with imidacloprid) in experimental studies [10, 55].
Both
moxidectin
formulations
showed
full
efficacy
(100%) while ivermectin showed an efficacy of 87% to
93% [53]. Furthermore, most ML currently used to
prevent dirofilarial infections are not fully efficacious
against D. repens microfilariae; only moxidectin has been
approved as a microfilaricidal agent and it must be
administered in four monthly doses [56].
Against the adult stages of D. repens, the efficacy of
melarsomine dihydrochloride currently used against D.
immitis patent infections is doubtful. There is only one
report of an effective treatment obtained with melarso-
mine plus doramectin in a dog naturally infected with D.
repens [57], but the data was never confirmed and no
efficacy was found in previous clinical studies (Genchi
et al., 1996, unpublished). Recently, good adulticidal
efficacy (96%) was found in experimentally infected
dogs treated monthly for 6 months with moxidectin
2.5 mg/kg body weight (plus imidacloprid 10 mg/kg
body weight) [8].
There are several reasons that might explain the differ-
ence in efficacy between avermectins and milbemycins.
Moxidectin is more lipophilic in nature than ivermectin
and it is stored in the fat, which may act as a drug reser-
voir. Compared with ivermectin, moxidectin has a
higher distribution volume and a longer half-life elimin-
ation. This may facilitate its distribution from the blood-
stream to different tissues and longer residence time for
the drug in the body [58, 59]. Furthermore, the recom-
mended dose rate of moxidectin against D. immitis
infective larvae is 3 μg/kg vs 6 μg/kg of ivermectin [3].
Finally, D. repens larval stages and adult worms reside in
the subcutaneous tissues, which are rich in fat and con-
nective tissue.
Therefore, the higher lipophilic nature of moxidectin
is probably the reason for the full efficacy observed in
the studies. Furthermore, P-glycoprotein (P-gp) is a
membrane protein belonging to the superfamily of the
The Author(s) Parasites & Vectors 2017, 10(Suppl 2):517
Page 3 of 235
 ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters and exerts a
potent action vs drug disposition. Moxidectin toxicity
depends to a lesser extent on P-gp activity compared
with ivermectin (moxidectin seems to be a weaker
substrate inhibitor of P-gp than ivermectin [60]). This
may explain the higher recommended dose rate of
moxidectin vs ivermectin in dogs (eg, 2.5 mg/kg for
moxidectin and 6 μg/kg for ivermectin), which therefore
makes the spectrum of efficacy of this ML broader.
Conclusions
For all the reasons discussed in this article, D. repens in-
fection is much more difficult than D. immitis to
diagnose and control in the reservoir population (micro-
filaremic dogs). If the spread of D. repens continues, it is
certainly possible that it could be introduced in the
United States by translocation of infected dogs. In
addition, while veterinarians and pet owners are aware
of D. immitis infection [61], lack of familiarity with D.
repens infection could lead to lack of vigilance underesti-
mation for this parasite.
The number of human cases in Europe and Asia is
currently a serious public health concern. On the other
hand, we cannot exclude the possibility that the high
zoonotic impact of D. repens is not merely a reflection
of the more “visible” clinical signs in humans, eg, sub-
cutaneous nodules and conjunctival and subconjunctival
infections, which are easier to diagnose than D. immitis
lung infections. Nonetheless, medical doctors and veteri-
narians must collaborate closely for better control and
surveillance of D. repens infection. In the Ukraine,
reporting cases of dirofilariosis has been mandatory
since 1975, and the disease was included in the national
surveillance system for notifiable diseases [31]. Guide-
lines for the control and treatment of D. repens infec-
tions can be found in the ESCCAP Guideline 5 [62].
