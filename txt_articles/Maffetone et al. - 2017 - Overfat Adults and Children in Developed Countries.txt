The global overfat pandemic is a serious public health crisis that places a substantial 
burden on economic resources in developed countries. The term overfat refers to the 
presence of excess body fat that can impair health, even for normal weight non-obese 
individuals. Excess body fat is associated with cardiometabolic dysfunction, a clinical 
situation that can progressively worsen, potentially leading to various common disease 
risk factors, chronic diseases, increased morbidity and mortality, and reduced quality of 
life. The prevalence of overfat populations in 30 of the world’s most developed countries 
is substantially higher than recent global estimations, with the largest growth due to 
a relatively recent increased number of people with excess abdominal fat. Abdominal 
overfat is the most unhealthful form of this condition, so it is concerning that average 
waist circumference measures, generally indicative of abdominal overfat, have increased. 
Despite a leveling off appearance of being overweight and/or obese in some developed 
countries, the overfat pandemic continues to grow.

Key FindinGs
On average, the prevalence of overfat adults and children in developed countries is extremely high, 
and substantially greater than that of overweight and obese individuals.
In the US, New Zealand, Greece, and Iceland, prevalence of the overfat condition is at an alarmingly 
high rate of over 90% in adult males and up to 50% in children.
Despite a leveling off appearance of the overweight and/or obese condition in some developed 
countries, the overfat pandemic continues to grow.
In tandem with an increased average waist circumference, a recent rise in the incidence of abdominal 
adiposity, the unhealthiest form of excess body fat, has been observed in both adults and children.
introdUCtion
It was recently estimated that between 62 and 76% of the world’s population have reached body fat 
levels that can impair health (1). This condition, which can now be labeled a pandemic, was described 
by the catch-all term overfat (Table 1). It is well-recognized that the overweight and obese conditions 
represent a continuing threat to world health, replacing more traditional problems of undernutrition

and infectious diseases. Indeed, being overfat shares direct links 
to insulin resistance and chronic inflammation, and to hyperten-
sion, dyslipidemia, coronary heart disease, stroke, cancer, Type 
2 diabetes, gallbladder disease, osteoarthritis and gout, pulmo-
nary diseases, sleep apnea, and others (2). Global rates of these 
conditions in adults and children (including adolescents) have 
risen significantly over the past ~40 years, paralleling significant 
increases in the numbers classified as being overweight and obese, 
and considerably affecting people of all ages and incomes in both 
developed and developing countries (3).
While the prevalence of being overweight and obese is well 
known (4), many normal-weight and non-obese individuals 
exhibit excess levels of body fat that can adversely affect their 
health (5–7). Indeed, reliance of body mass index (BMI) for 
determination of being overweight and obese may misclassify up 
to 50% or more of patients with excess body fat who may have 
increased health risks (8, 9). The notion of a metabolically obese 
normal weight (MONW) individual is based on the finding that 
obesity-associated disorders such as high circulating insulin levels 
in people with cardiovascular disease or Type 2 diabetes can occur 
in those with normal BMI (10–14). Many at-risk individuals have 
been identified in a BMI range of 23–25 or lower (11). Overfat 
individuals who are not overweight and obese include MONW 
individuals (10, 15, 16), those with sarcopenic obesity (17), and 
many who have increased abdominal fat stores. Abdominal and 
visceral fat accumulation, regardless of weight status, has been 
found to increase risk of cardiovascular and metabolic (cardio-
metabolic) disease to the greatest degree (10, 18–20).
In addition, the similar concept of normal weight obesity 
(NWO) expands on the notion of MONW by describing the 
association between normal weight and high body fat percent-
age (BFP) with cardiometabolic abnormalities (21). Oliveros 
et al. (22) refer to MONW individuals as a likely subset of NWO 
people. Thus, we include both categories in our estimations of 
overfat populations herein.
Body mass index is calculated as body weight (in kilo-
grams) divided by height (in meters) squared, with the World 
Health Organization (WHO) defining overweight as having a 
BMI ≥ 25–29.9 and obesity as having a BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2 (2, 4). 
While it is well-known that central to the pathophysiology of 
obesity is an excess amount of adiposity, clinicians and research-
ers usually rely on BMI (which does not directly estimate body 
fat) to define the presence of adiposity or obesity—a practice 
strengthened by the discovery of an association between BMI and 
increased mortality (23).
However, large multiethnic samples from the US general 
population have demonstrated that BMI has limited diagnostic 
performance in correctly identifying individuals with excess 
body fat, particularly in those with BMI < 30 kg/m2, with BMI 
missing more than half of people with BFP-defined obesity (8, 9). 
For example, Hung has shown that up to 70% of young women 
with high BFP would be missed by BMI category alone (24). The 
main limitation of BMI is that it cannot differentiate fat mass from 
lean mass, or central from peripheral fat (5, 22). Furthermore, the 
relationship between BMI and BFP varies considerably among 
different ethnic groups, further lowering the utility of BMI as a 
predictive measure of adiposity and health risk for many groups 
of people (25, 26).
Regardless of body weight or BMI, excess BFP in adults is 
associated with a wide range of cardiometabolic dysregulation, 
as indicated by various risk factors associated with downstream 
disease and mortality (5–7). In particular, excess BFP is associ-
ated with elevated fasting triglycerides and glucose, low HDL and 
high LDL cholesterol, increased blood pressure, a higher odds 
ratio of developing the metabolic syndrome, along with Type 2 
diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and other chronic illness, with 
increased mortality as a consequence. The earliest dysregulation 
is often observed now in children (10, 27).
Perhaps the earliest onset of cardiometabolic dysregulation 
begins as a vicious cycle of excess body fat, insulin resistance, 
and chronic, low-grade systemic inflammation (28, 29). Excess 
adiposity is a source of inflammatory molecules that can disrupt 
glucose homeostasis and contribute to the pathogenesis of insulin 
resistance (30, 31). In turn, insulin resistance further exacerbates 
adiposity by influencing glucose disposal and fat storage. As 
such, the overfat condition potentially contributes to two adverse 
metabolic conditions (chronic inflammation and insulin resist-
ance), which then contribute to further adiposity. This is in 
effect a vicious cycle wherein the appearance of adiposity and its 
initial consequences feed back into themselves, accelerating and 
entrenching the dysregulation (See Figure 1).
An updated definition of obesity based on adiposity, not on 
body weight, is urgently needed (22). As we have argued, the term 
overfat fills this void. As such, the term may be better suited to 
help public health efforts in reducing cardiometabolic risk factors 
and preventing disease, improving quality of life, and mitigating 
the economic burden of this global problem.
Calculation of Fat Mass
The methods used to quantify BFP include bioelectrical impedance, 
hydrostatic plethysmography, isotope dilution techniques, dual 
x-ray absorptiometry (DXA), skinfold method, body impedance 
measures, and others, with DXA one of the most accurate and pre-
cise methods available to measure total body fat and lean soft tissue 
mass directly (32). Epidemiologic studies have also demonstrated 
that central fat distribution assessed through waist circumference

(WC), waist-to-hip ratio, and waist-to-height ratio (WHtR) 
measures can be very useful in assessing adiposity-related risk (22); 
although, like BMI, these measurements cannot estimate BFP
.
While there is still no consensus on normal BFP cutoffs, 
Gallagher et al. (33) suggest they should vary with age such as 
20–39 years, >19 and >32%; 40–59 years, >21 and 33%; and 
60–79 years, >24 and 35% for men and women, respectively (33). 
Body fat distribution, genetics, and fitness also can contribute to 
the development of health risk factors.
Recent large-scale epidemiological analyses, such as the 2013 
Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study reported in Ng et al. (4), 
have attempted to provide a picture of obesity-related health risk 
on a worldwide scale, defining the prevalence of overweight and 
obese conditions using common BMI conventions for adults 
(overweight as ≥25 to <30 kg/m2 and obesity as ≥30 kg/m2). 
Childhood obesity is often based on the International Obesity 
Task Force definition, which established definitions for global 
classification of children as overweight and obese (34).
The implications of relying on BMI as a principal measure 
of obesity are not limited to the context of clinical diagnosis 
of individuals. Indeed, doctors often have access to other tools 
that allow them to correct for the drawbacks of BMI. The larger 
problem is that most large-scale epidemiological studies that use 
BMI have no way of correcting for the metric’s disadvantages. 
As a result, these studies may have substantially underreported 
the population of individuals who are at risk of obesity-related 
cardiometabolic disease. Effectively, overreliance on BMI may 
have serious implications on our ability to size the problem, and 
therefore on our ability to properly address its consequences.
A central purpose of this paper is to take recent theory and 
data on normal weight non-obese populations at cardiometabolic 
risk due to excess body fat, combine them with those who are 
overweight and obese, and provide preliminary estimates of over-
fat people in 30 of the most developed countries according to the 
Human Development Index (HDI), as described in the Human 
Development Report for 2014, authored by the United Nations 
Development Program (35). Our expectation was that developed 
countries would show a higher proportion of overfat individuals, 
in part due to lower levels of underfat, with developing nations 
outnumbering developed ones by more than 6:1 (36).
oVerFat as a risK FaCtor
Overfat individuals may be at increased risk for developing a wide 
range of health problems, including cardiometabolic abnormali-
ties, downstream diseases, and increased morbidity and mortality 
(5, 37). Overweight and obesity alone represents the fifth leading 
risk for global deaths (38) and is projected to become the most 
common modifiable factor among preventable causes of global 
death (39). Estimating the extensive prevalence of overfat can 
add to our public health knowledge in addressing the pandemic, 
including preventing the earliest forms of chronic illness.
Clustering of subclinical risk Factors
The potential for a single risk factor to have clinical value should 
not be underestimated and could very well be the earliest sign of 
future disease (40). The overfat condition can be understood as 
a subclinical risk factor, which can precede the more significant 
cardiometabolic dysregulations noted above. Increased WC 
alone, such as in normal-weight individuals, is associated with 
the metabolic syndrome, as are other subclinical conditions such 
as prediabetes (41) and prehypertension (42).
The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 
(NHANES) III attempted to establish the relationship between 
health and nutrition in the United States population. In this study, 
within the group of normal-weight adults with higher BFP, the 
prevalence of metabolic syndrome and its individual components 
was shown to increase linearly with increases in BFP (5). In a 
study of Brazilian adults (20–23 years), higher BFP in normal 
weight was also associated with metabolic syndrome and insulin 
resistance (43).
The clustering of risk factors, such as those observed in meta-
bolic syndrome, MONW, and NWO, suggests that more than one 
primary abnormality typically exists in certain individuals. For 
example, a predisposition to glucose intolerance, associated with 
insulin resistance, may be a common factor in the case of those 
who are overfat (44). A significant number of other cardiometa-
bolic risk factors were also shown in up to 30% of normal weight, 
non-obese male individuals who demonstrated impaired fasting 
glucose (45). Adiposity and weight gain were key determinants 
of the degree of clustering of cardiometabolic risk factors in 
Framingham study participants, with increased WC being a pri-
mary factor (40). Within this larger clustering occurs the chronic, 
smaller category of metabolic syndrome. Wilson and Meigs (40) 
state that, “Excess adiposity, especially abdominal adiposity, and 
insulin resistance are probably key ingredients that lead to the 
 FiGUre 2 | General schematic of relationships between diet, overfat, some risk factors, and chronic illness.

development of the risk factor abnormalities that then translate 
into the clinical outcomes.”
Unfortunately, most of the studies demonstrating cluster-
ing of common conditions do not include well-described 
subclinical disorders that can pre-date disease states, such as 
prehypertension and prediabetes. Future studies should address 
relationships between these very early risk factors with that of 
glucose intolerance and insulin resistance, and its impact on 
cardiometabolic health (46, 47). This might also include evaluat-
ing overfat children, whose conditions can play a key role in the 
advent of downstream diseases typically exhibited in adulthood. 
Unfortunately, adiposity in children is likely to feed the overfat 
pandemic because research shows that obese children are at 
increased risk for becoming obese adults with chronic disease 
(48–53).
Clustering of Clinical risk Factors
Since the early observations of Ruderman et al. in 1981, the list of 
associated disorders clustered in normal-weight overfat popula-
tions has grown (11). Rather than thinking of these disorders 
as separate, individual clinical problems, it might be best to 
consider the relationships between overfat, its various risks, and 
its associated downstream diseases as a spectrum or progression 
where the vicious cycle of overfat, insulin resistance and chronic 
inflammation lies at one end, (constituting the population with 
early measurable abnormality), while the presence of chronic 
conditions resides at the other end (see Figure 2).
Prevalence of the conditions listed in Figure 2 is also increased 
in individuals with a history of low birth weight, as well as in 
normal-weight (<25 BMI) offspring and other first-degree 
relatives of patients with these conditions (10). A preliminary 
evaluation of the offspring (mean age 54 years) of the original 
Framingham study cohort found that 44% of the population had 
one or more abnormal findings associated with insulin resistance 
(54). Other associated disorders include (1) neuroinflammation, 
which can affect the function of the hippocampus, cortex, brain-
stem, or amygdala, with clinical conditions such as depression 
and impaired cognitive function (55), as well as (2) reduced 
quality of life, which includes a twofold risk of physical activity 
difficulties such as walking and climbing stairs, increased pain, 
and hindrance to daily activities (56).
Another cardiometabolic risk is cancer-related clustering of 
prediabetes, diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and chronic inflam-
mation (57). The cancer-obesity connection in the past was 
limited to a small number of cancers. However, Lauby-Secretan 
et al. (58) recently emphasized that the absence of excess body fat 
lowers the risk of most cancers and discussed the possibility that 
the association between higher body fat and cancer risk is causal. 
In addition, survival rates among persons with chronic diseases 
such as cancer may decrease, as increased body fat is associated 
with worse treatment outcomes (59).
To summarize, whether an individual presently meets the 
criteria for NWO but not MONW (or for MONW but not for 
metabolic syndrome) is inconsequential to whether they are 
overfat, and therefore at increased risk of downstream cardio-
metabolic impairment.
is obesity Leveling? overfat is not
Based on BMI evaluations, there appears to be a leveling off of the 
trend in rising obesity rates in some developed nations (60, 61).

Overfat Adults and Children in Developed Countries

However, the incidence of central adiposity—the excess accumu-
lation of visceral fat in the abdominal region, sometimes called 
abdominal obesity (62)—is increasing (61). This form of overfat is 
concerning because the potential health risks of central adiposity 
are more pronounced than those for increased subcutaneous 
fat in other regions of the body (63). The continued increase in 
abdominal obesity includes those who are normal weight and 
non-obese, with US population averages of 54.2% (51.3–57%), 
and an increased prevalence in women (up to 68.3%) (61).
It may be too early to make the claim on a leveling of obesity 
rates for various reasons. Previous stable phases of the obesity 
epidemic have been followed by further increases (64). There 
are also increased rates of abdominal obesity as indicated by 
increases in WC (61, 65). While obesity has recently plateaued at 
35% for US men, it continues to increase to 40% for women, with 
a similar trend in the 60 years and older group (66), with morbid 
obesity rates continuing to rise in developed countries (67, 68). 
One billion adults are projected to have obesity by 2025, far more 
than the current levels (69). In addition, younger generations are 
becoming obese at an earlier age and are staying obese for a longer 
duration than older generations (70).
The notion that obesity in some countries has slowed or 
leveled may constitute an inconsistent public health message 
that erroneously implies we are solving a serious problem while 
the overfat pandemic continues to grow. Despite the trends in 
overfat, weight counseling and clinical diagnosis of overweight 
and obesity in US primary care significantly declined between 
1995–1996 and 2007–2008 (71, 72). In addition, fewer overweight 
and obese adults report trying to lose weight between 1988–1994 
and 2009–2014, with percentages declining from 56 to 49%, 
respectively (73).
Metabolically Healthy obese (MHo)
Researchers have described MHO individuals, a prevalence 
estimated at 7.27% (74), who, despite having BMI > 30, appear 
relatively insulin sensitive and lack some or most of the metabolic 
abnormalities typical of obese individuals (75–78). Even though 
conditions such as metabolic syndrome may not be prevalent in 
MHO individuals, the presence of fewer (or other) cardiometa-
bolic risk factors typically associated with obesity can still exist. 
Within these, being overfat is the critical factor that confers risk 
for Type 2 diabetes and CVD associated with adiposity (37). In 
a large, community-based sample of men and women across a 
broad age spectrum, Meigs et al. (37) stated that MHO subjects 
were younger than obese subjects with metabolic syndrome, but as 
they age, they may transition from obese and apparently healthy to 
obese with risk factor clustering. This implies that MHO individu-
als may be in the process of becoming metabolically unhealthy. 
Wang et al. (74) showed that the prevalence of MHO was lower 
for adults > 40 years than the general population, and that these 
individuals were at increased risk for all-cause mortality and/
or cardiovascular events over the long-term (≥10 years). Other 
studies have noted that these seemingly healthy obese subjects 
may have subclinical disease, concluding that longer follow-ups 
or more careful evaluation may be required before referring to 
them as healthy (79, 80). As such, we consider so-called MHO 
individuals to also be overfat (22).
economics of overfat
The economic fallout from the overfat pandemic has raised a 
serious global challenge. In 2011, the WHO estimated that the 
economic burden of preventable, non-communicable disease 
(in particular cardiovascular disease, cancer, and diabetes) is 
expected to create a cumulative output loss of US$47 trillion over 
the next two decades (81). In 2010, this represented 75% of global 
GDP (US$ 63 trillion)—enough capital to lift the 2.5 billion 
people currently below the poverty line, out of poverty for more 
than half a century. While it is difficult to determine the absolute 
burden of the overfat pandemic, it is clearly a strong causal factor 
in the development of a significant portion of chronic disease and 
reduced quality of life.
WHo is oVerFat
It is important to recognize high-risk populations for better 
adiposity-based risk stratification, along with a need for an 
updated definition of obesity based on adiposity, not on body 
weight (22). We previously estimated the global prevalence of the 
overfat population using several subpopulations that included 
those who are overweight, obese, MONW individuals, those 
with sarcopenic obesity and others (1). Additionally, the overfat 
pandemic has not spared physically active people, including pro-
fessional athletes in various sports (82, 83) and active US military 
personnel (84, 85).
Unique to developed countries are the recently increased num-
bers of older persons more likely to develop sarcopenic obesity, 
and the increase in abdominal obesity that outpaces increases in 
BMI. We introduce two new additional terms to more accurately 
describe excess fat accumulation in those who are sarcopenic and 
those with increased abdominal adiposity. Specifically, because 
the term “obesity” has historically been explicitly based on BMI, 
its use to describe these two body compositions is arguably 
incorrect and may even be confusing to the public and media. We 
therefore aim to better define and draw attention to two growing 
components of the overfat pandemic, sarcopenic overfat, and 
abdominal overfat.
sarcopenic overfat
Sarcopenia is defined as the progressive loss of type II fast-twitch 
muscle fibers and strength with aging and is an important 
public health problem with a prevalence as high as 50% in those 
>80 years (86). Muscle atrophy can coexist with an accumulation 
of fat within existing muscle, and the combination of higher body 
fat and sarcopenia has been termed sarcopenic obesity (87, 88), 
which we refer to henceforth in this paper as sarcopenic overfat. 
This condition is associated with low-grade chronic inflamma-
tion, insulin resistance, elevated C-reactive protein, and excessive 
oxidative stress (17). Sarcopenia increases the risk of disability 
and poor quality of life, and death, and may have an important 
association with chronic illness and aging. In the elderly, who 
naturally exhibit the highest rates of mortality in survival studies, 
the diagnostic performance of BMI is at its worst, likely to be 
highly under-estimating the extent of overfat people with sarco-
penic overfat (8).

abdominal overfat
The increasing rates of overfat people are due in great part to 
increased incidence of abdominal obesity in adults and children 
(61, 89). Other terminologies used for this condition include vis-
ceral obesity, visceral adiposity, android obesity, central obesity, 
the hypertriglyceridemic waist, and others. Since the problem can 
occur in people who are not obese, we suggest the term abdominal 
overfat as a simplified one that broadly defines the specific prob-
lem of excess abdominal fat.
Two separate components of abdominal fat include visceral 
adipose tissue and subcutaneous adipose tissue, the former being 
associated with more adverse risk factor profiles than the latter 
(45, 90). Although total adiposity is strongly associated with car-
diometabolic risk, it is becoming increasingly clear that visceral 
adipose tissue is a stronger correlate of risk than BMI, WC, or 
abdominal subcutaneous fat (91), and more strongly associated 
with insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and atherosclerosis than 
peripheral obesity (92).
The recognition that abdominal overfat has separate and 
more severe health effects is not new (93–106). Prospective epi-
demiological studies have demonstrated the power of abdominal 
overfat to predict premature death in conjunction with various 
cardiometabolic-related chronic diseases in both men and women 
(107). Numerous studies more recently reported secular increases 
in WC in men and women in the US, England, Australia, Finland, 
and the Netherlands (108–115).
In our estimation of overfat children, we considered studies 
that measured BFP and WHtR. BFP measures may represent a 
reasonable method of estimating the population of normal-weight 
non-obese children, as excess body fat can exist in those with 
a BMI < 25 (116). Based on the WHtR (<0.5 vs. ≥0.5), 37% of 
normal-weight non-obese children had at least one cardiometa-
bolic health risk factor (associated with WC, triglycerides, and high 
blood pressure), 13.5% had at least two risk factors, and 0.3% had 
three risk factors (117). Moreover, as with adults, abdominal 
overfat is associated with greater health risks in children (118, 119).
In recent decades, the prevalence of childhood abdominal 
overfat has increased more quickly than the prevalence of obesity 
as defined by BMI (120, 121). While, as in adults, research shows 
an unexpected plateauing of childhood obesity rates in some 
developed countries (122), increased rates of abdominal overfat 
appear to have maintained the overall growth rate of the overfat 
pandemic. In addition, extreme obesity in children continues to 
increase despite the fact that rates for lower obesity categories are 
leveling or even declining (123). In light of the clear limitations 
of the BMI described herein, the WHtR may be the single best 
clinical indicator of health risk as it can be used throughout child-
hood, into adult life, as well as throughout the world (in all ethnic 
groups). (See Figures 3 and 4) (124, 125).
Additionally, as an important part of clinical practice, the 
routine measurement of WC is consistent with current recom-
mendations for the prevention, control, and management of 
overfat in patients (126).

We estimated the incidence of overfat in 30 developed nations 
listed in Table 2 using the HDI described by the United Nations 
Development Programme’s Human Development Report for 2014 
(see Figure 5). Accurate estimations of the prevalence of overfat 
populations is challenging, especially considering that appropriate 
BFP analyses (e.g., X-ray absorptiometry, DXA) are not common. 
However, a number of studies have been helpful in differentiating 
normal-weight and non-obese but overfat individuals from those 
who are overweight or obese (8, 9, 127) As such, in addition to 
the estimations of overweight and obese populations (4), we also 
considered individuals with increased BFP and or WC/WHtR in 
normal-weight non-obese adults with signs of cardiometabolic 
impairments as discussed above, including two national studies in 
the UK and US, which provided useful data on children who were 
normal weight and not obese. Griffiths et al. (128) showed that 17.6% 
of normal-weight non-obese boys and 17.3% of normal-weight 
non-obese girls who exceeded a WHtR of 0.5 were considered “at 
risk,” as compared with children who were overweight or obese and 
above the 85th percentile (128). Flegal et al. (116) estimated the 
prevalence of high adiposity for children below the 85th percentile 
using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry to estimate BFP and 
found that a high number of children with normal BMI had high 
adiposity—35% of children within the 65th percentile cutoff and 
24% of children within the 70th percentile cutoff.
Our estimates did not include normal-weight non-obese peo-
ple who had high fat mass but only early signs of cardiometabolic

dysfunction (such as prediabetes or prehypertension), because 
insufficient data were available. However, the numbers of indi-
viduals in this category could be significant. For example, predia-
betes in the US has risen to ~34% in the population even among 
those who are normal weight (129). Prehypertension is also not 
uncommon and increases the risk for incident hypertension and 
cardiovascular mortality (130).
Since data for overfat subpopulations was not uniformly avail-
able for the same year, we used the most recent data available in 
order to produce our estimates. Ng et al. (4) used a similar strategy 
to provide estimates of various populations at risk of metabolic 
disease, as do other large-scale epidemiological studies cited 
throughout our paper. The most recent data, obtained from the 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) website shows 
that 71% of US adults were overweight or obese (131). However, 
for continuity, our analysis for all countries used data from Ng 
et al. (4), which shows overweight and obesity in US adults at 66%. 
Had we used the more recent CDC data, our estimate for the US 
would likely have yielded much higher percentages of overfat.
In our estimation of overfat adults and children, it was not 
possible to precisely quantify all categories of overfat individuals. 
One limitation of our estimates is that we may have underrated 
those 70–80 years and older with sarcopenic overfat, and those 
who were institutionalized or otherwise in poor health, as these 
individuals are usually not part of community and other popula-
tion studies. In addition, younger children up to 5 years are often 
not counted in population studies. Children between the ages of 5 
and 14 years may have already been overfat when entering kinder-
garten (132). The use of WC and WHtR often use relatively high 
cutoff points and may miss early conditions of overfat potentially 
making our estimates conservative. Likewise, BFP in most adult 
studies typically use relatively high cutoff points recommended 
by the WHO of 30 for men and 35 for women, furthering the risk 
of underreporting overfat individuals.
The importance of our review includes increasing awareness 
of the overfat pandemic in developed countries, whose rates are 
relatively higher than worldwide percentages. In addition, we have 
emphasized the continued increase of overfat populations despite 
the appearance of a leveling of both overweight and obesity in 
some developed countries. Of greater awareness is the concern 
that the largest increase in overfat is due to both increases in the 
prevalence of abdominal overfat and the increasing average size 
of WCs, as abdominal overfat is the most serious form of the 
overfat pandemic. Bringing these factors into evidence could help 
lead to action in reducing the overfat pandemic.
Continued debate on how best to measure obesity and body 
fat may miss an important clinical point. That being, that most 
clinicians in the course of their normal in-office assessments 
usually know if the patient in front of them has too much body 
fat. Clinicians should not have to wait for the latest consensus or 
for a patients’ fat mass to reach a pre-established cutoff in order 
for them to implement appropriate lifestyle strategies to reduce 
excess body fat in their patients.
In the future, an accurate evaluation of the prevalence of overfat 
will need to include a consistent and accurate measurement of BFP 
across populations, as well as a general consensus on cutoffs along 
with factors associated with fat distribution, and the relationships 
with health risks. These evaluations of overfat should be based on 
epidemiologic studies with long-term follow-up and information on 
overfat-related comorbidities and mortality. However, this should 
not be done at the expense of population-wide effective remedies 
to reduce the incidence of the overfat pandemic and to prevent its 
growth by addressing the problem as it emerges in children.
ConCLUsion
The estimate of overfat in the world’s 30 top developed nations is 
substantially higher than the prevalence of overweight and obese 
adults and children worldwide and stresses the seriousness of the 
overfat pandemic. Regardless of BMI values, overfat individuals 
have excess body fat, a high degree of cardiometabolic dysregula-
tion that can promote disease risk factors and chronic disease, 
increased morbidity and mortality, reduced quality of life, and pose 
a rising economic burden. As an unfulfilled public health action, it 
is crucial to clinically identify individuals who are overfat in order 
to implement successful treatment and prevention strategies.
