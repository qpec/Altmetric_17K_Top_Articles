abstract
OBJECTIVE: To identify predictors of eating in the absence of hunger (EAH) in low-income 
toddlers, describe affect during EAH, test EAH as a predictor of body mass index (BMI), and 
examine the type of food eaten as a predictor of BMI.
METHODS: EAH, indexed as kilocalories (sweet, salty, and total) of palatable foods consumed 
after a satiating meal, was measured (n = 209) at ages 21, 27, and 33 months. Child 
gender, age, race/ethnicity, and previous exposure to the foods; maternal education and 
depressive symptoms; and family chaos, food insecurity, and structure were obtained 
via questionnaire. Child and mother BMI were measured. Child affect was coded from 
videotape. Linear regression was used to examine predictors of EAH and the association of 
kilocalories consumed and affect with 33 month BMI z-score (BMIz).
RESULTS: Predictors of greater total kilocalories included the child being a boy (P < .01), being 
older (P < .001), and greater maternal education (P < .01). Being in the the top quartile of 
sweet kilocalories consumed at 27 months and showing negative affect at food removal had 
higher BMIz (β = 0.29 [95% confidence interval 0.10 to 0.48] and β = 0.34 [95% confidence 
interval, 0.12 to 0.56], respectively).There was no association of salty kilocalories 
consumed or positive affect with BMIz.
CONCLUSIONS: There was little evidence that maternal or family characteristics contribute to 
EAH. EAH for sweet food predicts higher BMIz in toddlerhood. Studies investigating the 
etiology of EAH and interventions to reduce EAH in early childhood are needed.

WHAT’S KNOWN ON THIS SUBJECT: Eating in the 
absence of hunger (EAH) is a measurable, genetically 
linked behavior that is associated with overweight 
in children ages 3 to 13 years. Previous work has 
shown the potential for behavioral intervention.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: EAH occurs in toddlers. 
Consumption of sweet, but not salty, foods increases 
across toddlerhood during EAH, and greater EAH 
predicts greater adiposity at age 33 months.

Eating behaviors, including greater 
food responsiveness, greater 
food enjoyment, less satiety 
responsiveness, lesser capacity to 
voluntarily inhibit eating, greater 
impulsivity, and lesser self-control 
have been linked with greater 
obesity risk and have been the topic 
of substantial investigation.1 The 
continued consumption of foods 
past satiety, referred to as eating in 
the absence of hunger (EAH), 
2 
is correlated with greater food 
responsiveness and enjoyment, 
and less satiety responsiveness, 
3 
as well as greater adiposity.4–15 
Interventions that reduce 
responsiveness to food cues16–18 
have been shown to reduce EAH, but 
interventions that increase children’s 
awareness of hunger and satiety 
cues had no effect.16 Thus, EAH may 
primarily reflect food enjoyment 
and responsiveness as opposed to 
sensitivity to hunger and satiety cues.
There are a number of gaps in the 
existing literature. First, we have 
been unable to identify any studies of 
EAH that have focused on low-income 
children, who are at particularly high 
risk for childhood obesity19 or chil 
dren 
younger than age 3 years. Second, 
though some studies have examined 
the stability or change in EAH with 
age, 
5, 
6, 
9–11, 
15 none have done so in 
children younger than 4 years. Third, 
studies examining maternal and 
family characteristics as predictors 
of child EAH2, 
4, 
5, 
7–11, 
 14, 
20–23 have 
been in predominantly white cohorts 
with the exception of 1 study that 
examined only Hispanic children.8 
Fourth, children exhibit a liking for 
sweet taste even in the newborn 
period, 
24, 
25 but whether the association 
between EAH and adiposity differs 
based on the type of food eaten in 
the absence of hunger has not been 
described. In addition, most studies 
on early childhood2, 
4–15, 
20–22, 
 26, 
27 
examine only the amount consumed 
as an outcome; we have been 
unable to find any studies that have 
also examined children’s affect 
during the EAH protocol and how 
this affect may be associated with 
child adiposity. We posit that affect 
during the EAH protocol reflects 
food enjoyment and responsiveness, 
each of which have been correlated 
with kilocalories consumed during 
EAH3 and greater adiposity in older 
children.28
Therefore, within a diverse cohort 
of low-income children followed 
longitudinally at ages 21, 27, and 
33 months, we sought to address 
4 objectives: (1) to examine child, 
maternal, and family characteristics 
predictive of EAH across 
toddlerhood; (2) to describe child 
affect during EAH; (3) to test the 
prospective association of EAH with 
BMI z-score (BMIz) at age 33 months; 
and (4) to examine the type of food 
eaten and the association with BMIz.
METHODS
Participants and Recruitment
Participants were recruited via 
flyers posted in community agencies 
serving low-income families between 
2011 and 2014. The study was 
described as examining whether 
children with different levels of stress 
eat differently. Inclusion criteria were 
that the biological mother was the 
legal guardian, had an education level 
less than a 4-year college degree, 
and was at least 18 years old; the 
family was eligible for Head Start, the 
Women Infant and Children Program, 
or Medicaid and was English-
speaking; and the child was between 
21 and 27 months old, was born at a 
gestational age ≥36 weeks, and had 
no food allergies or significant health 
problems, perinatal or neonatal 
complications, or developmental 
delays. Mothers provided written 
informed consent. The University of 
Michigan institutional review board 
approved the study.
Mother–child dyads were invited 
to participate in 3 data collections 
at ages 21, 27, and 33 months; 
the data collection procedures at 
each age spanned across 5 days 
and included measures regarding 
eating behavior and biobehavioral 
self-regulation. A total of 244 dyads 
participated. Most (n = 186) dyads 
entered the study when the child 
was age 21 months, but 58 entered 
the study when the child was age 27 
months to maximize recruitment; 
measures obtained at study entry are 
henceforth referred to as “baseline” 
measures. This report is limited 
to children who participated in at 
least 1 EAH protocol (scheduled 
to be obtained on the fifth day of 
data collection at each age) and 
one anthropometric measurement 
(scheduled to be obtained on the first 
day of data collection at each age). A 
total of 209 of the 244 participants 
participated in the EAH protocol at 
a minimum of 1 age point at which 
they also provided anthropometry. 
The 209 participants included in 
this analysis did not differ from 
the excluded participants with 
regard to child gender, child age, 
maternal BMI, maternal education, 
maternal depression, family chaos, 
food security, or family structure. 
Of the children with complete data 
included in this report, 47.4% were 
non-Hispanic white compared with 
25.7% of those not included (P = 
.02). A total of 52 children (24.9%) 
participated at only 1 age point, 85 
(40.7%) participated at only 2 age 
points, and 72 (34.4%) participated 
at all 3 age points. Mother–child 
dyads who participated at 2 or 3 age 
points did not differ at baseline from 
those who participated at only 1 age 
point with regard to child gender, 
child age, child race/ethnicity, 
maternal BMI, maternal education, 
maternal depressive symptoms, food 
security, or family structure. Those in 
the sample who participated at 2 or 3 
age points, compared with those who 
participated at only 1, were more 
likely to report higher family chaos 
(Confusion, Hubbub, and Order Scale 
[CHAOS] score, 4.3 [SD, 3.3] vs 3.1 
[SD, 3.0] [P = .03]).

EAH Protocol
Mother–child dyads were invited to 
participate in a standardized protocol2 
to assess the child’s EAH at ages 21, 
27, and 33 months in the child’s home. 
The mother was asked to have the 
child fast for 1 hour and then serve the 
child a typical lunch that included at 
least 2 different foods and 1 drink.
After the lunch ended, a research 
assistant presented a standardized 
plate of foods (Table 1) and told the 
child, “Here are some special treats 
you can eat.” Mothers reported how 
often the child had eaten the food in 
the past 4 weeks (Table 1). To reduce 
food neophobia, 
29 the experimenter 
ate 1 Oreo cookie off of the plate and 
said, “I'm going to have one, too. Mmm, 
this is really good. You can eat as much 
as you want.” The child was given free 
access to the food. The mother was 
asked not to interact with the child 
during the protocol. After 10 minutes, 
the plate of food was removed. The 
remaining food was weighed and the 
amount consumed was calculated.
Affect was coded from video on a scale 
from 0 (none) to 2 (high intensity). 
Positive affect was coded for the 10 
seconds during which the research 
assistant was delivering the plate to 
the child and the 40 seconds after 
plate presentation. Negative affect was 
coded for the 10 seconds during which 
the research assistant was moving to 
remove the plate from the child and the 
10 seconds after plate removal. Inter-
rater reliability was high (Cohen’s 
κ > 0.80). A child whose positive affect 
was >0 after plate presentation was 
categorized as having “positive affect 
at food presentation.” A child whose 
negative affect was >0 after plate 
removal was categorized as having 
“negative affect at food removal.”
Anthropometry
Weight, length, and height of the child 
were measured by trained research 
staff. Weight-for-length z-score 
(WLZ) and BMIz were calculated 
based on the US Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention growth 
charts.30 Mothers’ weight and height 
were measured and BMI calculated.
Questionnaires
Mothers reported child gender, 
birth date, and race and ethnicity; 
for this analysis, child race/ethnicity 
was categorized as non-Hispanic 
white versus not. Mothers reported 
maternal education (more than a 
high school diploma versus not), and 
family structure (single mother versus 
not). The Center for Epidemiologic 
Studies-Depression scale is a valid, 
reliable 20-item questionnaire31 
designed to measure depressive 
symptoms. Mothers respond to a 
scale ranging from 0 (rarely or none 
of the time) to 3 (most or all of the 
time), and responses are summed so 
that a higher score indicates more 
symptoms (range, 0–60). CHAOS32 
consists of 15 statements (true = 1, 
false = 0) that are designed to assess 
chaos in the home environment; 
scores range from 0 to 15, with higher 
scores reflecting more chaos. The US 
Department of Agriculture 18-item 
Household Food Security Survey33 
categorizes households as food secure 
versus not.
Statistical Analysis
Analyses were conducted by using 
SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute, Inc, Cary, 
NC). Univariate statistics were used 
to describe the sample. Bivariate 
analyses were conducted by using t 
tests and χ2 tests. One-way repeated 
measure ANOVAs were used to test 
whether total, sweet, and salty calorie 
consumption differed across 21, 27, 
and 33 months. Cochran Q tests were 
used to test whether positive affect 
at food presentation and negative 
affect at food removal differed across 
21, 27, and 33 months. If ANOVA 
or Cochran Q test results were 
significant (P < .05), then post hoc 
comparisons were conducted using 
paired t tests or McNemar tests.
Generalized estimating equations, 
using all available cases, were 
used to predict calories consumed, 
positive affect at food presentation, 
and negative affect at food removal, 
accounting for repeated measures 
within subjects. Predictor variables 
were added in 3 steps: child

characteristics (gender, age, race/
ethnicity, and previous exposure to the 
EAH foods), maternal characteristics 
(BMI, education, and depressive 
symptoms); and family characteristics 
(household chaos, food security, and 
family structure). Child age, maternal 
BMI, depressive symptoms, and 
family structure were time varying 
covariates. At each step, variables that 
were statistically significant (P < .05) 
were retained and 95% confidence 
intervals were calculated. For binary 
variables, parameter estimates were 
converted to odds ratios.
Five multivariate linear regression 
models were used to predict child 
BMIz at 33 months from kilocalories 
consumed (total, sweet, and salty), 
positive affect at food presentation, and 
negative affect at food removal. To ease 
interpretation and given preliminary 
models suggesting that the relationship 
was nonlinear, we categorized 
kilocalories consumed into quartiles 
and compared the top quartile to the 
bottom 3 quartiles. The top quartiles 
at age 21 months were ≥114.3 kcal 
total, ≥84.1 kcal sweet, and ≥40.8 
kcal salty. The top quartiles at age 
27 months were ≥147.7 kcal total, 
≥122.5 kcal sweet, and ≥46.2 kcal 
salty. These 5 models were fitted for 
predictors measured at age 21 months 
and again for predictors measured 
at age 27 months. Each model was 
adjusted for child gender, child race/
ethnicity, maternal education, maternal 
BMI, food insecurity, and baseline 
child WLZ. These models followed the 
maximum likelihood (ML) approach, 
which produces valid estimates when 
missing data are missing at random.
RESULTS
Characteristics of the sample are 
shown in Table 2. The sample was 
51.2% boys, 51.2% white, 25.8% 
black, and 11.0% Hispanic. The mean 
WLZ at study entry was 0.51 (SD 
1.06). Among the mothers, 38.3% 
had an education level of a high 
school diploma or less. The sample 
size of participants contributing 
to analyses at each age is shown in 
Table 3. Amount of food consumed 
and affect during EAH are shown in 
Table 4 across ages. Total kilocalories 
consumed increased with age (P < 
.001). When examined separately 
by food type (sweet vs salty), there 
were only significant increases in the 
amount of sweet food, but not salty 
food, consumed. Positive affect at 
food presentation also increased with 
age (P = .004). Negative affect at food 
removal did not change with age.
Table 5 shows results of the 
multivariate models testing 
predictors of EAH. Being a boy, 
older child age, and more maternal 
education each predicted more 
kilocalories consumed. Being a boy 
and older child age each predicted 
more kilocalories of sweet food 
consumed. Older child age and 
food insecurity predicted display of 
positive affect at plate presentation. 
None of the child, maternal, or family 
characteristics predicted kilocalories 
of salty food consumed or the display 
of negative affect at food removal.
Results of the multivariate models 
predicting BMIz at 33 months are 
shown in Table 6. Neither kilocalories 
consumed nor affect at 21 months 
predicted 33-month BMIz. Both 
kilocalories of total and sweet food 
consumed at 27 months predicted 
greater 33 month BMIz. Kilocalories of 
salty food consumed at 27 months was 
not associated with 33 month BMIz. 
Showing negative affect at food removal 
at 27 months was associated with 
higher 33 month BMIz. Positive affect 
at plate presentation at 27 months was 
not associated with 33 month BMIz.
DISCUSSION
The main findings of this study 
were that EAH increased during

toddlerhood, particularly for sweet 
foods. Greater intake of sweet food 
and the display of negative affect 
when the food was taken from the 
child predicted greater adiposity. To 
our knowledge, no other published 
reports have described EAH in 
children this young. The results 
of this study align with previous 
work in older children reporting that 
EAH increases with age5, 
6, 
9–11, 
15 
and is associated with increased 
adiposity.4–15 The results also 
align with work in infants showing 
that parent-reported greater food 
responsiveness predicts greater 
prospective weight gain from ages 3 
to 15 months.34
Although older children showed 
positive affect at food presentation, 
this positive affect was not 
associated with greater BMIz at 
33 months. Rather, negative affect 
at food removal predicted greater 
subsequent BMIz. To our knowledge, 
no other studies have observed the 
behavior of children in response to 
the EAH protocol, and this is the first 
report describing a link between 
affect during key points in the EAH 
protocol and weight gain.
Boys were more likely to display 
EAH, especially for sweet food, 
which differs from previous 
literature that did not detect gender 
differences in EAH among older 
children.2, 
6–8, 
12–14, 
22, 
 26, 
 27, 
35, 
36 The 
only maternal characteristic related to 
EAH was maternal education. Maternal 
BMI was not associated with EAH, 
which aligns with findings of some 
studies, 
22 but not others.8, 
10, 
11 It was 
hypothesized that the characteristics 
related to household stressors in 
these low-income families (CHAOS, 
food insecurity, single mother family 
structure) would predict EAH. 
However, no association was found. 
EAH has previously been shown to 
be heritable via the fat mass and 
obesity-associated (FTO) gene.26, 
27 
This behavior may be related to other 
biological factors that have yet to be 
identified.
The association between EAH and 
future weight status did not emerge 
until age 27 months. EAH is believed 
to reflect a biological predisposition 
to increased food cue reactivity. The 
food cue reactivity is believed to be 
a type of Pavlovian conditioning.16 
As such, it exemplifies a likely gene–
environment interaction. For EAH 
and its effects on weight status to 
manifest, a child with a biological 
predisposition to increased food 
cue reactivity may need to have had 
sufficient exposure to food cues 
to elicit EAH. The findings suggest 
that the food cue reactivity is 
conditioned with repeated exposure 
to palatable foods before age 2 years, 
but the conditioned response is not 
detectable until age 27 months.
Interpretation of these findings 
should note the study limitations. 
The home-based protocol reduced 
experimental control, but increased 
ecological validity. The presence of

the researcher during the protocol 
may have influenced the child’s 
behavior. The fact that the researcher 
modeled eating a sweet food and 
not a salty food may have increased 
the likelihood that the toddlers ate 
sweet, as opposed to salty, foods. The 
longitudinal design is a strength, but 
because of the high-risk nature of the 
study cohort, attrition was high and 
there were missing data. Results may 
not be generalizable to other study 
populations outside low-income 
toddlers in the United States. Despite 
these limitations, the study was 
able to describe eating behavior in a 
very young age group longitudinally 
in a diverse population at a lower 
socioeconomic level than previous 
work.
CONCLUSIONS
Hedonic intake of sweet food is 
visible, starts to increase, and 
predicts weight gain in children 
younger than age 3 years. Given that 
EAH increases with age5, 
6, 
9–11, 
15 
and behavioral intervention has 
been shown to reduce EAH, 
16 this 
study suggests that the timing of 
interventions targeting this behavior 
may need to occur before age 3 
years. Developing interventions to 
reduce EAH that are developmentally 
appropriate for toddlers may be 
an important, novel intervention 
strategy. The lack of association with 
maternal and family characteristics 
suggests that further understanding 
of the etiology of EAH may require 
more studies about the underlying 
biology of this behavior.

Predictor variables were added in 3 steps: child characteristics, maternal characteristics; and family characteristics. At each step, only variables that were statistically signifi
 cant (P < 
.05) were retained in the model. The dashes indicate that the variable was not statistically signifi
 cant and was therefore not retained in the model. CI, confi
 dence interval; OR, odds ratio.
