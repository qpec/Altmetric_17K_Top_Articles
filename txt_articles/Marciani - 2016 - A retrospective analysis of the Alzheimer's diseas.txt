Abstract
The
promising
results
obtained
with
aducanumab
and
solanezumab against Alzheimer’s disease (AD) strengthen
the vaccine approach to prevent AD, despite of the many
clinical setbacks. It has been problematic to use conjugated
peptides with Th1/Th2 adjuvants to induce immune responses
against conformational epitopes formed by Ab oligomers,
which is critical to induce protective antibodies. Hence,
vaccination should mimic natural immunity by using whole or
if possible conjugated antigens, but biasing the response to
Th2 with anti-inflammatory adjuvants. Also, selection of the
carrier and cross-linking agents is important to prevent
suppression of the immune response against the antigen.
That certain compounds having phosphorylcholine or fucose
induce a sole Th2 immunity would allow antigens with T-cell
epitopes without inflammatory autoimmune reactions to be
used. Another immunization method is DNA vaccines com-
bined with antigenic ones, which favors the clonal selection
and expansion of high affinity antibodies needed for immune
protection, but this also requires Th2 immunity. Since AD
transgenic mouse models have limited value for immunogen
selection as shown by the clinical studies, screening may
require the use of validated antibodies and biophysical
methods to identify the antigens that would be most likely
recognized by the human immune system and thus capable to
stimulate a protective antibody response.

There are strong pre-clinical indications of a natural
protective immunity against Alzheimer’s disease (AD) that
decreases with age (Britschgi et al. 2009; Dodel et al.
2011). These indications have been strengthened by the
promising clinical results from the aducanumab study on a
monoclonal antibody (mAb) that is a replica of an anti-
amyloid-b (Ab) IgG1 isolated from healthy, aged donors
who were cognitively normal (Jeffrey 2015; Keller 2015).
Indeed, these results support previous pre-clinical ones that
used intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) from young
healthy donors, showing the presence of anti-oligomeric
Ab antibodies that dropped with age as well as anti-tau
antibodies (O’Nuallain et al. 2010; Dodel et al. 2011);
antibodies that may explain the IVIG’s efficacy in averting
AD (Fillit et al. 2009). Yet, clinical studies using IVIG as a
therapeutic agent in mild to moderate AD cases, have failed
to demonstrate any therapeutic benefits (Schindowski et al.
2014; Karran and Hardy 2014). However, a significant
difference between the retrospective study (Fillit et al.
2009) and the various IVIG clinical studies is the popula-
tion tested. While in the retrospective study the patients
were required to have an absence of Alzheimer’s disease
and related disorders diagnosis for at least 1 year before the
first IVIG treatment, in the IVIG clinical trials the patient
population had already been diagnosed with mild to
moderate AD (Schindowski et al. 2014; Karran and Hardy
2014). Hence, as with many other diseases prevented by

 vaccination or active immunization, these findings support
immunization using vaccines which contain immunogens as
a way to induce, enhance, and maintain the protective
immunity that decreases with age as a result of immunose-
nescence. Still, it is evident that while naturally occurring
autoantibodies (nAbs) are effective in a preventive mode,
they are significantly less effective when used as therapeutic
agents; a situation observed with many vaccines against
pathogens. Evidently, vaccination would be a cost-effective
practical medical solution to control the mounting AD
global epidemic (Rizzi et al. 2014), particularly considering
the economic condition of some less-developed countries.
However, while all of the clinically tested AD vaccines
have shown beneficial effects in transgenic mouse models
of AD, none of them have shown tangible improvements of
the AD symptoms in humans (Agadjanyan et al. 2015).
Hence, it is evident that there are some issues with the
animal models and vaccine formulations. Although the
options available for animal models are limited because of
the intrinsic differences between the transgenic animal
models and humans, this is not the case with vaccines.
Indeed, there is significant information concerning both the
immunogen and adjuvant components of AD vaccines
(Wisniewski and Goni 2014; Agadjanyan et al. 2015;
Marciani 2015a), which could be useful to develop effective
vaccine formulations.
AD vaccines have been developed following a methodol-
ogy derived from infectious disease and cancer vaccines.
There are, however, significant differences between the
immune responses elicited against pathogens or tumor cells
and against self-antigens like Ab (Marciani 2014). Indeed, as
pathogens and tumor cells express neo-antigens foreign to
the immune system, the likely response will be an inflam-
matory Th1/Th2 immunity – an immune response designed
to destroy the pathogen, infected cells or tumor cells having
those foreign or non-self-antigens (Li et al. 2014; Parmiani
et al. 2014). However, in proteinopathies like AD, the
immunogens are self-antigens where the differences between
normal and aberrant forms are largely structural rather than
compositional, that is a result of protein misfolding, which
triggers alterations of some of the conformational and
oligomerizational properties (Merlini and Belloti 2003; De
Genst et al. 2014). In fact, these changes turn the aberrant
proteins into cytotoxic agents that in the case of Ab are
neurotoxic (Larson and Lesn�
e 2012; De Genst et al. 2014;
Burnouf et al. 2015). Therefore, depending on the type of
immunity induced by a vaccine, that is, anti-inflammatory or
pro-inflammatory,
the
immune
response
may
prevent,
improve, or aggravate proteinopathies. Of interest is that in
AD vaccine’s development, most of its problems are a result
of the plights of the first AD vaccine, AN1792, which had as
an immunogen Ab1–42 and the potent pro-inflammatory QS-
21 as an adjuvant (Wisniewski and Konietzko 2008;
Marciani 2015a).
Basically, the AN1792 vaccine’s serious side-effects were
caused by QS-21, which elicited a systemic Th1-biased anti-
Ab immunity, triggering the meningoencephalitis that led to
the end of the clinical study (Wisniewski and Konietzko
2008). While the inflammatory response of the AN1792
Phase 2 study can be explained by the amplifying effect of
polysorbate 80 on QS-21 activity (Marciani 2014, 2015a),
that is, the modified AN1792 delivered an ‘immunological
overdose’ of QS-21 (Marciani 2014), the absence of side-
effects during Phase 1 is puzzling. In effect, it raises
questions about the vaccine’s QS-21 structural integrity, as
de-acylation of QS-21 results in a shift from Th1/Th2 to Th2
immunity and a decrease in adjuvanticity (Marciani et al.
2001; Marciani 2014). It should be pertinent to indicate that
there are no sole Th1 adjuvants, as Th2 immunity always
follows a Th1 immune response; but, adjuvants can bias the
response toward one type of immunity, which in the case of
QS-21 is strongly toward Th1 (Marciani 2003; Kensil 2006).
Yet, as opposed to the numerous Th1/Th2 adjuvants
available, there are very few adjuvants that induce a sole
Th2 anti-inflammatory immunity, these latter adjuvants being
the best suited for vaccines to treat and/or prevent pro-
teinopathies like AD (Marciani 2014).
As AD usually begins after 65 years of age, when the
immune system starts to show an age-linked decline, the
immune responses after vaccination would be weaker than
that of the young adult population. This immune decline or
immunosenescence is the reason for the higher susceptibility
to infections and cancer among the elderly, and lower
vaccine efficacy (Mazzola et al. 2012; Goronzy and Weyand
2013). A trait of immunosenescence is the loss of protein
receptors and/or ligands by antigen-presenting cells and T
cells, which are crucial for their immunological performance,
a loss that leads to immune tolerance (Vallejos et al. 2002;
Marciani 2003, 2015a). That the loss of these proteins varies
across the aging population would explain the spread in
antibody titers for the Phase 2 clinical study of the AN1792
vaccine as well as the other AD vaccine studies. Hence, the
preventive value of AD vaccination would depend on the
recipients’ immune competence; yet, a delay of just a few
years in the onset of AD would be of significance in dealing
with this epidemic. Aside from being a cost-effective
preventive approach, AD vaccination would also allow the
passive immunotherapy using mAbs to be reserved for those
who need it the most: the immune compromised elderly
population.
Ab peptides as immunogens
An outcome of the AN17920s damaging results was to
modify the Ab antigens by deleting the T-cell epitopes to
avoid pro-inflammatory responses; but, continue using Th1/
Th2 adjuvants, like QS-21 and ISCOMS (Agadjanyan et al.
2015; Marciani 2015b). A modification that apparently did

 not take into consideration the fact that these adjuvants,
regardless of the immunogen used, would induce a powerful
systemic inflammatory immunity; which spreads through the
body via cytokines and other factors and that is effective
against infections, which seldom are localized. Hence, it is
possible that the systemic immunity induced by these
adjuvants may amplify and aggravate the pre-existing
inflammatory immunity of the elderly population (Martorana
et al. 2012; Heneka et al. 2015). While it is uncertain why
encephalomyelitis is observed in some non-transgenic and
transgenic mouse models immunized with Ab plus Th1/Th2
adjuvants (Furlan et al. 2003; Vollmar et al. 2010), it is
apparent that CD4+ cells with a Th1 cytokine profile support
a systemic inflammatory immunity by providing helper
activity to develop other effector functions needed for Th1
immunity. Indeed, although CD8+ T cells or cytotoxic T
lymphocytes
are
found
in
the
brains
of
mice
with
encephalomyelitis, apparently these cells do not play a role
in the inflammatory process (Rosset et al. 2015). A situation
similar to that reported for the postmortem results of some of
the individuals immunized with the AN1792 vaccine, where
CD8+ T cells were present, but apparently did not play a role
in the brain damage (Ferrer et al. 2004; Zotova et al. 2013).
A common difference between the various vaccines used
in the mouse models and AN1792 studies is the adjuvant or
immune modulator component; while most vaccines tested in
AD mouse models have complete Freund’s adjuvant (CFA)
(Schenk et al. 1999), the AN1792 and other human vaccine
had QS-21 or a similar quillaja saponin. Still, very often the
results obtained with CFA have been compared directly to
those obtained with QS-21 or Quil A, both q saponins, as
well as other Th1/Th2 adjuvants. But, while CFA and QS-21/
Quil A are pro-inflammatory Th1/Th2 adjuvants, they can
induce different functional immune responses; a situation
that have been shown with a rec. subunit vaccine against
feline leukemia virus (FeLV) (Marciani et al. 1991). In fact,
while challenge with FeLV of kittens vaccinated with a rec.
FeLV glycoprotein plus CFA yielded nearly 100% infec-
tions, non-vaccinated animals had the expected infection rate
of 30% (Marciani D. J., unpublished observations). Indeed,
CFA induced an immune-enhancement of disease (Pedersen
et al. 1986). In contrast, when the same rec. antigen was
administered following the same vaccination schedule but
with QS-21 instead of CFA, it induced over 90% protection
against the FeLV challenge (Marciani et al. 1991). These
results underscore the fact that Th1/Th2 adjuvants have
different immune modulatory mechanisms, and that infor-
mation from one adjuvant cannot be applied without
reservations to other Th1/Th2 adjuvants.
As mentioned before, deleting the T-cell epitopes from Ab
is a strategy used to avoid an inflammatory response (Fu
et al. 2010), and this is a change that results in the loss of
two-thirds of the Ab’s amino acid sequence and hence its
structural characteristics. In fact, shorted antigens cannot fold
and oligomerize to form the discontinuous conformational
epitopes characteristic of Ab oligomers and other amyloid
proteins, which were shown by the IVIG studies (O’Nuallain
et al. 2010; Dodel et al. 2011) and confirmed with anti-Ab
mAbs (Jeffrey 2015). Paradoxically, while these shorted
antigens conjugated to a carrier were ineffective in the
clinical studies, they were apparently effective in transgenic
mouse models, that is, effective enough to be allowed into
the clinical phase. An unsettling new report is that antibodies
against the Ab N-terminal region, which is composed only of
B-cell epitopes (Fig. 1), may be damaging since they
promote a change from non-toxic Ab fibrils to soluble
oligomers with enhanced neurotoxicity (Liu et al. 2015a),
which could induce or exacerbate the disease. In fact, studies
with dogs vaccinated with Ab and the Th2 adjuvant alum,
showed that once initial antibodies against the N-terminal
region had been produced and multiple subsequent immu-
nizations had been carried out the dogs switched to produce
the ‘protective’ conformation-sensitive antibodies (Vasilevko
et al. 2010). This situation is somewhat similar to the
AN1792 vaccine, where vaccinated humans developed
antibodies against the N-terminal region (Lee et al. 2005);
yet, they did not develop antibodies against the Ab
conformational epitopes, apparently a result of the limited
number of vaccinations. That IVIG from healthy young
donors do not have antibodies against the N-terminal region,
which recognize the monomeric Ab (Dodel et al. 2011), but
have antibodies against the soluble pathologic oligomeric
Ab, implies that the antibodies against the soluble Ab
oligomers are the relevant ones for the natural protection
against AD. Indeed, available data supports the notion that
binding of soluble Ab oligomers to cellular membranes
initiates various neurotoxic effects via complex pathways;
yet, it is apparent that these soluble oligomers are in a
dynamic equilibrium with insoluble amyloid plaques, which
apparently act as reservoirs of these neurotoxic oligomers
(Mucke and Selkoe 2012). Thus, ‘neutralization’ of these
toxic oligomers by specific antibodies must play a pivotal
role in the immune protection against AD.
A problem in the AD drug development has been the
validity of the transgenic mouse models, which have one or
more of the Ab mutations representing 5% of the total AD
cases to evaluate the potential of AD vaccines for humans,
hence the results should be considered cautiously (Cava-
naugh et al. 2014; Burns et al. 2015). In fact, one of the
problems with transgenic models is that low-molecular-
weight Ab oligomers, protofibrils, and fibrillar Ab, as well as
senile plaques are frequently present simultaneously in the
brain, which makes it very difficult to study the effects of
soluble Ab oligomers. However, a new approach using
repeated hippocampal injections of soluble Ab oligomers in
freely moving mice resulted in the production of the key
events leading to AD; thus, this model appears to avoid the
interference by other Ab forms (Brouillette 2014). While

 there are more reliable non-transgenic AD animal models,
like the canine model, a problem would be the length of the
studies, which could be extended to years instead of a few
months (Head 2013). Yet, its use in combination with new
mouse models could minimize the strategic and financial
risks associated with extensive clinical trials, while increas-
ing the chances of developing effective immune therapeutic
products.
Carrier-induced epitope-specific suppression
(CIESS)
Assuming that shortened Ab antigens could be effective
protective immunogens in peptide vaccines, another compli-
cation would be the need for a carrier protein to induce an
effective immunity and anamnestic response. While carriers
are used for short linear peptides, it is hard to conceive how
discontinuous conformational epitopes formed by oligomer-
ization of Ab monomers can be mimicked by short linear
peptides linked to a protein. Yet, it is possible to mimic
conformational epitopes by assembling short peptides to
resemble the 3D structures of the desired region (Hoogerhout
et al. 2011; Rasool et al. 2012). Such constructs would
frequently need to be linked to a carrier protein to become
immunogenic. While proteins, such as keyhole limpet
hemocyanin (KLH), tetanus toxoid and non-toxic bacterial
toxin mutants, are used as carriers to make peptides
immunogenic, there is the problem of CIESS associated
with their use (Schutze et al. 1985). In this phenomenon, the
anti-peptide antibody response is suppressed, as the carrier
protein induces an antibody response that competes with the
anti-peptide response (Sad et al. 1991; Kaliyaperumal et al.
1995). Indeed, a vaccine based on a recombinant influenza
virus expressing the N-terminal Ab1–10 epitope, failed to
induce an anti-Ab immune response in animals that have
been primed with the virus alone (Davtyan et al. 2014).
These results underline the problems concerning the use of
carrier proteins in conjugate vaccines; particularly if the
vaccinees have been exposed to that protein before. A lesser
known fact is that cross-linking agents having aromatic
groups and/or maleimide, which is commonly used to link
peptides to carriers via a thioether, can be very immunogenic;
consequently, the immune response may be focused on the
linker rather than the peptide, potentially contributing to
CIESS (Boeckler et al. 1996). Yet, showing the complexities
of the immune response to conjugated vaccines, it has also
been reported that maleimide conjugation significantly
enhances both the antibody and T-cell responses of idio-
type-KLH vaccines (Kafi et al. 2009). However, in the case
of Id-KLH cancer vaccines, the conjugated antigen is a
whole IgG with B and T-cell epitopes, rather than a small
peptide. While it is possible to lessen the carrier-induced
suppression, another complication is that this suppression is
strain-dependent, that is, it varies according to the vaccinees’
genotype (Kaliyaperumal et al. 1995). An intricate situation,
as humans are genetically vastly diverse; which may partially
explain the broad distribution of antibody titers among the
recipients of the conjugated AD vaccines. Yet, those results
may also have been influenced by the immunosenescence
affecting the elderly population (Weinberger et al. 2008;
Goronzy and Weyand 2013). Hence, the evaluation of
conjugated vaccines may require extensive clinical trials to
make sure that they will be equally effective in different
populations over extended periods of time.
To prevent CIESS, a strategy effectively used with some
peptide vaccines has been to replace the carrier protein with a
well-defined T-cell epitope (Th epitope), linked to the
immunogenic peptide made only of B-cell epitopes (Sad
et al. 1992; del Guercio et al. 1997). Yet, the success of this
approach may be restricted to peptides having only B-cell
epitopes, very unlikely with conformational epitopes that
owing to the requirements for their formation will doubtless
have both T- and B-cell epitopes. Moreover, assuming that
these peptides have both B- and T-cell epitopes, they still
would require assembling to mimic those conformational
epitopes; an objective that may be distorted by the presence
of Th epitope, which would impact the conformation of the
construct. Hence, while some peptides may be effective as
immunogens for AD vaccines, the requirement for a 3D
configuration may limit their use. In addition, it should be
also consider that those conformational peptides, as in the
case with linear peptides, may not be effective in humans
even though they are quite effective in transgenic mouse
models.

oligomers from plaques increasing brain damage. The Ab14–34 region
contains different amino acid sequences that can activate T cells to
induce a damaging inflammatory autoimmune response in the pres-
ence of Th1/Th2 adjuvants. In contrast, nAbs target the mid-/C-
terminal region of Ab, Ab28–40, which is characteristic of Ab soluble
oligomers; yet, these protective antibodies do not recognize Ab
monomers. (Adapted from Dodel et al. 2011).

 evaluation are made of short peptides. These are largely from
the Ab N-terminal with one vaccine using the C-terminal
region (Fig. 1), but in all cases without T-cell epitopes and
linked to a carrier. Here, we would focus on those vaccines
that have completed Phase 1 clinical studies (Table 1); the
exception being the vaccine using the C-terminal region,
which because of its unique target will be discussed here.
A vaccine developed by Pfizer/J&J as a safer AN1792
alternative, vanutide cridificar (http://www.ama-assn.org/
resources/doc/usan/vanutide-cridificar.pdf) also known as
ACC-001 (Table 1), has an Ab N-terminal peptide linked
to the carrier protein CRM197, which is a non-toxic mutant
of diphtheria toxin (Winblad et al. 2014). A problem with
CRM197 is its use as a carrier in various approved
polysaccharide conjugate vaccines; a situation that would
result in pre-exposure to the carrier in a large sector of the
population and the potential enhancement of CIESS (Schutze
et al. 1985; Davtyan et al. 2014). A recently completed
Phase 2 study with this vaccine in Japan, showed mild to
moderate adverse effects in most subjects (Arai et al. 2015).
This was evidently a reaction to the inflammatory QS-21
adjuvant, which was needed to induce a high anti-Ab
antibody response (Arai et al. 2015). While there are no
reports about benefits to the patients, it is unlikely that there
were any since the immune response was directed against the
Ab N-terminal region, rather than at the most likely
therapeutic target: the soluble oligomeric Ab.
Another AD vaccine conjugate, Affitope AD02 (AFFiRiS/
GSK), has a non-self-antigen peptide mimicking the Ab
N-terminus region (Table 1) (Mandler et al. 2015). Although
the reported results for the Phase 2 clinical study are not
obvious, it is evident that Affitope AD02 did not meet
the primary or secondary endpoints, and therefore it has
been
discontinued
(http://adisinsight.springer.com/drugs/
800029150). A different type of AD peptide vaccine is
CAD106 (Novartis), which has a virus like particle as a
carrier for the Ab peptides (Chackerian et al. 2006; Jennings
and Bachmann 2008) (Table 1). Like the previous vaccines,
the antibody response is targeted to the problematic Ab N-
terminal region (Fig. 1); this vaccine is in Phase 2 clinical
studies (Farlow et al. 2015). Different from the previous
vaccines, the vaccine V950 (Merck & Co, Kenilworth, NJ,
USA) did not have a carrier protein (Table 1). Instead, the
Ab N-terminal peptide(s) was chemically linked directly to
ISCOMATRIX, probably using a lipid anchor. ISCOMA-
TRIX is
a delivery
system made up of cholesterol,
phospholipids and Q. saponins as an adjuvant (Sun et al.
2009). While V950 has a different carrier/delivery system,
like with the other vaccines, its response was directed at the
Ab N-terminal region. Although there is no information
about the results with V950, the clinical studies were ended
by its sponsor. One more AD vaccine using an Ab N-
terminal peptide conjugated to some T-cell epitopes is UB-
311 (United Biomedical, Inc. Hauppauge, NY, USA)
(Table 1). While there is no information about the type of
immunoresponse, owing to the CpG/Alum adjuvant mixture
it is expected to be Th1/Th2 and, indeed, inflammatory
(Bode et al. 2011). A different approach has been used in the

 vaccine ABvac40 (Grifols SA, Barcelona, Spain) (Table 1),
currently in Phase 1 clinical studies. This vaccine was
developed based on the observation that antibodies against
the C-terminal region of Ab (Fig. 1) affect the aggregation of
Ab (Monta~
n�
es et al. 2013). Thus, it probably has a short C-
terminal Ab peptide(s) conjugated to KLH; but, there is no
information about the peptides’ size or the cross-linking
agent used to prepare these conjugates. Nonetheless, different
from the Ab N-terminal region, the C-terminal region is
lipophilic, internalized rather than exposed and plays an
important role in Ab oligomerization (Wu et al. 2009). Its
lipophilic character explains its fusogenic properties, which
may contribute to Ab’s cytotoxicity by destabilizing the cell
membrane (Pillot et al. 1996). Therefore, the C-terminal
region seems to be a good candidate as a therapeutic target
for the prevention and treatment of AD; a proposition that
may be answered by the ongoing clinical studies.
As anticipated from the current knowledge of AD’s
pathology and immunology, all the epitope vaccines carrying
peptides representing the Ab N-terminal region have failed to
show any clinical benefits (Wisniewski and Goni 2014;
Agadjanyan et al. 2015). Indeed, the use of the Ab N-terminal
region asan immunological target, isnotsupported by the mAb
or IVIG studies (O’Nuallain et al. 2010; Dodel et al. 2011),
which have shown that the natural protective immunological
target is a discontinuous conformational epitope formed by
soluble Ab oligomers rather than the readily available Ab N-
terminal region (Jeffrey 2015; Keller 2015) (Fig. 1). The poor
immunogenicity of these vaccines and wide distribution of
anti-Ab antibody titers in the elderly may be a result of
immunosenescence plus CIESS (Loukov et al. 2015). Yet, a
more damaging situation would be the induction of antibodies
against the Ab N-terminal region, which could dissociate the
fibrils and increase in the brain the levels of neurotoxic Ab
soluble oligomers. In fact, it has been shown that a mAb
directed against the N-terminal region can cause this effect,
which is called the ‘dust-raising effect’ (Liu et al. 2015a). This
increase in neurotoxic oligomers triggered by the binding of
antibodies to the Ab N-terminal region and the releasing free
oligomers would explain some of the results of the AN1792
vaccine clinical study (Patton et al. 2006; Kokjohn and Roher
2009). Indeed, it has been shown using alternative methods
that insoluble amyloid plaques are not neurotoxic, unless they
are first solubilized to release toxic Ab dimers (Ono and
Yamada 2011). Still, an earlier publication has reported that in
addition to not disaggregating the fibrils antibodies against the
Ab1–11 N-terminal region also protect the neuronal cells from
the oligomers’ toxic effects; hence, based on those results that
region was proposed to be a strong immunogen candidate for
vaccines against AD (Mamikonyan et al. 2007).
A plausible explanation for these conflicting results may
be found in the antibody preparations used in those studies.
While the study reporting the damaging effects of antibodies
against the Ab N-terminal region was carried out with mAbs
(Liu et al. 2015a), the study reporting beneficial effects with
antibodies against the Ab1–11 N-terminal region used a
polyclonal antibody preparation (Mamikonyan et al. 2007).
It is well-established that in polyclonal antibodies, the initial
binding of one antibody facilitates the subsequent binding of
other antibodies against nearby epitopes, that is, a classic
example of cooperative effect. An outcome of this cooper-
ative binding is that the resulting overall strength of binding
or avidity, is much higher than the sum of the binding
strength for the individual antibodies or affinity (Perlmann
and Hammarstr€
om 1985); which would explain the higher
avidity reported for the polyclonal antibody preparation and
its effects on the aggregative and neurotoxic properties of Ab
oligomers as compared to mAbs (Mamikonyan et al. 2007).
Indeed, the polyclonal antibodies were induced by immu-
nizing the animals with Quil A, a potent Th1/Th2 adjuvant
that favors a high affinity maturation of antibodies, and were
purified by affinity chromatography using low pH elution
conditions. Purification of antibodies using low pH usually
results in some irreversible conformational damage (Ejima
et al. 2007), which most likely would inactivate the low
affinity antibodies leaving largely those antibodies with high
affinity; a selection that may explain the unique effects of
that polyclonal antibody preparation. Yet, the IVIG studies
did not show antibodies recognizing monomeric Ab, but
instead showed antibodies against the toxic oligomeric forms
(Dodel et al. 2011; Welzel et al. 2012), results supported by
the clinical results with aducanumab (Jeffrey 2015; Keller
2015). This makes it very unlikely that vaccines with the Ab
N-terminal region as an immunogen would induce a
protective immunity against AD in humans.
In effect, such a conclusion is supported by the disap-
pointing clinical results obtained with AD vaccines carrying
the Ab N-terminal region epitope. Moreover, it is possible
that those vaccines under conditions like immunosenescence
would induce a high production of low-avidity antibodies
against the N-terminal peptide, which analogous to the
mAb’s dust-raising effect will increase the load of neurotoxic
Ab oligomers, precipitating or aggravating the disease (Liu
et al. 2015a). Indeed, it has been reported that treatment of
an AD mouse transgenic model using a mouse mAb 3D6,
which is the mouse version of bapineuzumab that targets the
extreme N-terminal five residues of Ab, resulted in an
increased neuronal hyperactivity as compared with wild-type
mice expressing normal levels of Ab (Busche et al. 2015).
That this damaging effect linked to AD was observed in
animals with plaque as well as with animals too young to
have developed plaques seems to indicate that the mAb 3D6
favors the release of the soluble neurotoxic Ab oligomers
rather than their sequestration as plaques, aggravating the
disease. In fact, similar results were obtained with a different
mAb, b1 antibody, which is also directed against the N-
terminus of Ab and is capable of preventing Ab deposition in
an AD transgenic mouse model (Balakrishnan et al. 2015).

 Another significant finding is that antibodies against Ab N-
terminal region, Ab1–17, promote in a dose-dependent
manner the amyloidogenic processing of the parent amyloid
precursor protein; a process that drives up the production of
Ab and that may contribute to the development of sporadic
AD (Deng et al. 2012). These results corroborate the
damaging effects caused by antibodies against the N-terminal
region of Ab; a situation that may explain the clinical failure
of mAbs against that region to ameliorate AD regardless of
the disease’s stage. The antibodies against the wrong Ab
epitopes appear not to be neutral, but rather able to induce a
specific immunopotentiation of the disease.
Although the peptide vaccines approach is appealing, it is
more fitting for viral and cancer vaccines than proteinopathy
vaccines. Since the objective of cancer and viral vaccines is
to elicit a strong inflammatory immune response to destroy
abnormal cells, their antigens have T-cell epitopes that are
non-self peptides and that would be cytotoxic T lymphocyte
targets (Li et al. 2014). Also, the antigen’s construction will
be simplified by these antigens being mostly short linear
peptides (Elsawa et al. 2004). In effect, viral and cancer
vaccines do not have the restrictions on their antigen
composition and immune response that proteinopathy vac-
cines, like AD, have to avert damaging pro-inflammatory
autoimmune responses. Furthermore, cancer and viral vac-
cines inducing Th1/Th2 immunity have numerous pro-
inflammatory adjuvants with different mechanisms of action
that are frequently synergistic, which is not the case with AD
vaccines because of their Th2 immunity restriction (Marciani
2014). This situation illustrates the risks associated with
directly transferring methods from inflammatory vaccines to
those against proteinopathies, which are supposed to be anti-
inflammatory.
Therefore, the use of Ab1–42 as a vaccines’ immunogen
should be considered an effective option. Its relatively small
size makes this protein suitable for production by expression
vectors or peptide synthesis. While, Ab oligomerizes in
solution (Roychaudhuri et al. 2009; Ryan et al. 2010), the
oligomers and their conformational epitope(s) needed to
induce the production by the immune system of protective
antibodies, can be stabilized either by cross-linking or protein
engineering (Sandberg et al. 2010). It would also be
advisable, in view of the transgenic mouse models’ apparent
inability to detect Ab constructs suitable for human vaccines,
if the antigens are qualified initially using mAbs and highly
characterized IVIG preparations, such as those recently
described (Phay et al. 2015), in combination with biophys-
ical methods (Toyama and Weissman 2011). This approach
should narrow the antigen selection to be tested in animal
models to those likely to be recognized by the human
immune system, and hence formulated with the appropriate
adjuvants to be capable of inducing the production of
protective antibodies.
Ab and tau post-translational epitope-based
vaccines
Although the use of Ab1–42 would be safer than the short
peptides, there is a potential exception in the case of Ab
which has pyroglutamate as an amino terminal group at
positions
3
or
11
(Schneeberger
et al.
2009;
Perez-
Garmendia and Gevorkian 2013). Because this post-transla-
tional modification results in higher neurotoxicity, short
peptides carrying pyroglutamate and conjugated to a carrier
protein
are
potentially
effective
immunogens
for
AD
vaccines. Also, while the use of whole immunogens may
be convenient for small antigens like Ab, it may be difficult
to apply it to the much larger tau protein, another relevant
antigen for AD vaccines (Avila et al. 2004). In a way similar
to Ab, it has been shown that the pathological forms of tau
are oligomeric rather than monomeric (Lasagna-Reeves
et al. 2012). However, as the tau isoforms with 350–440
amino acids are random coil-type proteins about ten times
larger than Ab (Avila et al. 2004), it may be difficult to
retain its oligomeric forms in a reproducible manner and
without modifications in vaccine formulations. This is a
situation that may restrict the use of whole tau as an
immunogen. Hence, tau is a strong candidate for the peptide
approach. In fact, a conjugated vaccine with a tau peptide
crucial for tau-tau pathological interactions and tested in a
transgenic rat model (Table 1), have shown reduction in
both tau toxic oligomers and hyperphosphorylation (Kont-
sekova et al. 2014). This vaccine tested in Phase 1 clinical
studies showed a good safety profile and antibody produc-
tion, proving that in some cases the peptide approach may be
used effectively. That tau has various post-translational
modifications like phosphorylation, which presumably is
linked to its pathological effects, has prompted the use of
phosphorylated peptides conjugated to a carrier protein,
liposome or Th epitope as immunogens for vaccines
(Pedersen and Sigurdsson 2015). Yet, it has been reported
that the use of phosphorylated tau antigens with CFA, a Th1/
Th2 adjuvant, can induce damaging neuroinflammatory
responses in animal models, which are dependent on the
animal’s genotype (Rozenstein-Tsalkovich et al. 2013); this
situation again stresses the need for a sole Th2 immunity in
vaccines against proteinopathies. Of relevance for the
phosphorylated tau vaccines are the reports from the Kayed
and Novak groups. Questions are raised about the use of tau
hyperphosphorylation as a preventive or therapeutic target
by the observation that passive immunotherapy against tau
soluble oligomers reverses tauopathy phenotypes without
affecting the hyperphosphorylated neurofibrillary tangles
(Castillo-Carranza et al. 2014), and that vaccination with a
tau peptide essential for pathological tau–tau interactions
improves the AD phenotype and reduces tau hyperphospho-
rylation by 95% (Kontsekova et al. 2014).

 DNA vaccines – a promising strategy
A class of promising AD vaccines is based on DNA
immunization, with DNA encoding for a specific antigen
injected into the body so that its cells express the protein
(Coban et al. 2013). Significantly, Ab DNA vaccination
does not appear to induce a Th1/Th2 pro-inflammatory
response (Lambracht-Washington and Rosenberg 2012;
Matsumoto et al. 2013), which is the opposite of what
happens with DNA vaccines against pathogens (Asakura
et al. 2000). Perhaps this is the result of Ab being a self-
antigen in transgenic animal models. Observations that DNA
vaccination induces the production of antibodies against the
Ab conformational epitope(s) formed by its oligomerization
show that the expressed protein undergoes a refolding and
oligomerization processing similar to the native one. While
DNA vaccination has obvious advantages, its antibody
production is much lower than that induced by subunit
vaccines and like them it is affected by immunosenescence;
disadvantages that can be ameliorated by using adjuvants
(Saade and Petrovsky 2012). Also, it has been shown that as
with DNA vaccines against pathogens, a concurrent or
subsequent immunization with antigenic vaccines after DNA
priming yields higher immune responses than are elicited by
DNA vaccination alone (Davtyan et al. 2010; Lambracht-
Washington and Rosenberg 2015; Liu et al. 2015b). But, the
reported results for AD vaccines in two studies differ in the
nature of the immune response, that is, Th1/Th2 versus Th2 –
a difference that apparently is a result of the adjuvants used
in those studies, as discussed later.
An effect relevant for AD vaccines in particular, is that
although the antibody levels induced by DNA vaccines are
lower than those for antigenic vaccines, their affinity for the
antigen is significantly higher (Davtyan et al. 2010). This is
likely a result of the very low amounts of expressed antigen
after DNA priming, which would favor the clonal selection
of B cells having high affinity for Ab (Eisen 2014). Yet,
following vaccinations with Ab itself will favor the expan-
sion of those high affinity clones and thus antibody
production. A high affinity is crucial for AD vaccines, when
one takes into consideration the low levels of IgGs that pass
across the blood–brain barrier and enter the CNS. This high
affinity would offset the low antibody levels. Thus, it should
be valuable for vaccines that antigenic immunization with
DNA vaccination yields an elevated production of high
affinity antibodies. While some studies with aged mice have
shown no major differences from the response in younger
mice (Lambracht-Washington and Rosenberg 2015), other
studies have shown that adjuvants enhance the immunity
induced by DNA vaccines (Saade and Petrovsky 2012). Yet,
like with antigenic vaccines, the induced immunity should be
Th2 to prevent inflammation that will aggravate the disease.
While intramuscular (i.m.) and subcutaneous (s.c.) DNA
vaccination can favor cell-mediated and humoral immunity,
respectively, it is doubtful that such a differential immuniza-
tion will hold in the elderly. Most likely, the loss of muscle
mass and changes to the skin because of aging (loss of
elasticity and thinning) would reduce the difference in
induced immunity obtained with both types of vaccinations
in the younger population. Therefore, the use of Th2
adjuvants with both DNA and antigenic vaccination will
bias the immune response toward a safe anti-inflammatory
response, despite the vaccination mode.
Adjuvants or immune modulators for AD vaccines
As previously indicated, the immune modulatory activity of
Th1/Th2 adjuvants is not just local but also systemic
inducing
peripheral
inflammation
(Raghavendra
et al.
2004). Thus, removing the T-cell epitopes from an antigen,
as have been the case with all of the AD clinically tested
vaccines except for AN1792, would not prevent the inflam-
matory response elicited by Th1/Th2 adjuvants, as has been
shown in a mouse model (Vollmar et al. 2010). Actually, the
induction of Th1/Th2 or Th2-only immunity is not affected
by the protein antigen’s composition, depending solely on
the adjuvant or immune modulator (Marciani 2003; Berg-
mann-Leitner and Leitner 2014). As shown in Fig. 2, while
Ab has both B- and T-cell epitopes, the induced immune
response would depend on the adjuvant, with a Th1/Th2
inflammatory response most likely leading to cell death. Th2
immunity, on the other hand, would lead to production of
protective antibodies. Although the Th2 adjuvant alum has
been used to prevent Th1/Th2 immunity, its poor adjuvan-
ticity would not improve the vaccines’ performance in
elderly humans and animals (Reviewed in Marciani 2015a).
Another concern with alum is its neurotoxicity, amplified by
its biopersistence and brain translocation (Gherardi et al.
2015).
This
is
a
possibility
in
AD
vaccines,
where
immunosenescence would create the need for long-term
frequent vaccinations to maintain an acceptable level of
immunity. While it is doubtful that alum would be an
effective adjuvant for vaccines against proteinopathies,
vaccines like the one for AD would still require adjuvants
that not only induce Th2 immunity but also inhibit without
abrogating Th1/Th17 immunities that are needed as protec-
tion against pathogens and incipient tumors (Marciani 2014,
2015a).
For evolutionary reasons, most known adjuvants are
ligands of innate immunity receptors, such as toll-like
receptors (Akira 2011), which after eliciting an immediate
innate immune response evoke a more lasting adaptive one,
consisting of cell-mediated and humoral immunities or Th1
and Th2 immunities, respectively. Yet, while toll-like
receptor ligands induce Th1/Th2 immunity, they use differ-
ent receptors and pathways, which explains why some
ligands act synergistically, whereas others act antagonisti-
cally (Trinchieri and Sher 2007; Akira 2011). A different

 class of adjuvants are plant-derived glycosides like QS-21
and Quil A, which induce a strong anamnestic pro-
inflammatory response that results in a persistent Th1
phenotype after subsequent immunizations with the antigen
alone or with a weak Th2 adjuvant-like alum. A consequence
of the complexities regarding adjuvants’ mechanisms of
action has been some conflicting results reported in otherwise
sound scientific data. For instance, DNA vaccination used
together with antigenic immunization offers an effective way
to elicit a strong immune response with high affinity
antibodies. But two publications using this approach reached
different conclusions (Table 1). While in one case, co-
immunization with Ab1–42 (an expression plasmid and
protein) resulted in an enhanced antibody production without
an inflammatory response (Wang et al. 2014), in the other
publication the conclusion was fairly similar, but the higher
antibody production induced after vaccination with Ab was
concurrent with an inflammatory response (Lambracht-
Washington and Rosenberg 2015). Examination of the
protocols, showed that the inflammatory response coincided
with the use of the Quil A adjuvant in the follow-up antigen
vaccine, a situation that will result in a strong Th1-biased
anamnestic immune response. Indeed, the other study
without Quil A did not show any inflammatory responses
despite using Ab together with a DNA vaccine (Wang et al.
2014).
Because of immunosenescence and the fact that a protec-
tive antibody response may not be evoked by antigens that
have only B-cell epitopes, there would be a need for new
vaccine development strategies using new methods for
antigen design, for which adjuvants would be crucial to
safely mimic the natural protective immunity against AD.
Indeed, the adjuvants that would be useful are limited to
those that are Th2-only by the fact that the use of Th1/Th2
adjuvants with any type of antigen would induce a damaging
systemic inflammatory immune response. As mentioned
before, the availability of Th2-only adjuvants is very limited,
that is, the existing candidates for sole Th2 adjuvants are
products made by parasitic helminths, which have managed
to evolve so that they mimic compounds produced by the
body to induce immune tolerance (Marciani 2015a). These
new Th2 adjuvants are based on two pharmacophores,
phosphorylcholine and fucose (Fucp), both found in some
helminths’ derived products (Marciani 2014). In fact, a new
liposomal vaccine having Ab1–42 and sphingosine-1-phos-
phate has been tested in a transgenic AD mouse model and is

immunization with Th1/Th2 adjuvants, for
example, complete Freund’s adjuvant and
QS-21, would induce secretion by dendritic
cells (DCs) of Th1 ( ) and Th2 ( ) cytokines,
production of cell-mediated immunity or CMI
(Th1) and humoral immunity (Th2), causing a
systemic inflammatory Th1-biased immune
response. These pro-inflammatory cytokines
after being transported across the blood–
brain barrier would trigger a damaging
inflammation of the CNS. In contrast, sole-
Th2 adjuvants would induce DCs to secrete
Th2 while inhibiting the production of Th1
cytokines, evoking a beneficial systemic
humoral Th2 anti-inflammatory immunity as
well as protective antibodies against AD. Yet,
use of Th2 adjuvants with Ab N-terminal
peptides would not avert the damaging
effects caused by antibodies against this

 found to be safer and more effective than that with CFA
(Carrera et al. 2015). The Fucp-based adjuvants are glycans
that bind to the C-type lectin, (DC)-SIGN, present on DC,
biasing these cells to Th2 immunity (Thomas and Harn 2004;
Marciani 2014). In contrast to Th1 adjuvants that are foreign
to the body, these compounds are normal or mimic normal
body’s components and thus their side effects should be
minimal, as animal studies appear to indicate (Tundup et al.
2012). Of relevance is that a derivative from the inflamma-
tory glycoside QS-21 has been found to be an effective Th2-
only adjuvant (Marciani 2014). In effect, the available
information indicates that the single Fucp residue of this new
glycoside, QT-0101, is the group responsible for its anti-
inflammatory properties, presumably acting at the DC-SIGN
level (Marciani 2015c).
Summary and conclusions
While some positive results from AD immunotherapy made
this area one of the most promising to fight this disease, the
disappointing clinical outcome with AD vaccines raises
questions about feasibility. Yet, the promising clinical results
obtained with aducanumab (Jeffrey 2015; Keller 2015),
confirm the natural protective immunity against AD and
support preventive vaccination, which as usual would depend
on the immune competence of the vaccinees. From the
available information, it is possible to conclude that different
from past AD vaccines, an effective vaccine should replicate,
rather than replace the natural protective immunity, a strategy
that has been the cornerstone of the successful infectious
disease vaccines’ development for 200 years. Since passive
immunotherapy with mAbs does not rely on the individual’s
immune competence, it may be more effective than vacci-
nation; but because of both logistical and financial realities
associated with the use of mAbs, their use is likely to be
largely therapeutic. Still, a report from the Alzheimer’s
Association estimates that a treatment in 2025 that delays the
onset of AD by 5 years would decrease the number of cases
in the US from 8.2 to 5.8 million. In 2030 such a change
would result in a savings in the cost care of over $83 billion,
and these benefits would continue to increase with time
(Changing the trajectory of Alzheimer’s disease Report 2015.
http://www.alz.org/documents_custom/trajectory.pdf).
Hence, the development of vaccines to prevent and/or delay
the onset of AD makes sense, both medically and financially.
That nAbs against Ab are non-toxic to microglia and safe
when applied in vivo (Gold et al. 2013; Mengel et al. 2013)
supports the strategy of closely mimicking the natural
immune protection. Hence, different from most AD vaccine
prototypes, effective AD vaccines will need antigens like Ab
that have both B- and T-cell epitopes to reproduce the
conformational epitopes found in the natural immunogens
that induce an anti-AD protective humoral immunity.
Therefore, because of the antigen’s T-cell epitopes and
damaging effects of the systemic inflammatory immunity on
the CNS (Raghavendra et al. 2004; Rozenstein-Tsalkovich
et al. 2013), the only safe option in AD vaccines would be
the use of sole Th2 adjuvants. Yet, as these vaccines would
also be given to the elderly, it would be beneficial if they
could ameliorate immunosenescence while inducing a strong
Th2 immunity. These objectives cannot be attained by using
alum as an adjuvant. Actually, the effective use of vaccines
to prevent or delay the onset of AD may require starting the
immunizations while the individuals are still immune
competent, that is, years before the age of 65.
While it is feasible to ameliorate immunosenescence by
using combinations of Th1/Th2 adjuvants or inflammatory
cytokines (Haynes et al. 2004; Trinchieri and Sher 2007),
this option is not available for vaccines against pro-
teinopathies because of the damaging inflammatory response.
Hence, there is a need for sole Th2 adjuvants, which bias the
response toward a systemic Th2 immunity, while ameliorat-
ing the age-linked immune decline. Indeed, compounds like
QT-0101 may improve the immunosenescence associated
with the loss of CD28 in T cells, by delivering to them an
alternative co-stimulatory signal needed for T-cell activation
(Marciani 2003, 2015a). While the above conclusions have
been reached by examining the past Ab vaccines’ pre-clinical
and clinical results, it is evident that they would also apply to
vaccines with immunogens, like tau and a-synuclein, which
play roles in AD and other proteinopathies.
Although peptide-carrier conjugated immunogens may be
useful for epitopes having post-translational modifications,
their design should take into account the carrier’s nature and
the chemical structure of the cross-linking agents to curb
CIESS, which may interfere with the vaccine’s efficacy. This
challenging situation may be resolved by using when
possible large peptides or proteins carrying both T- and B-
cell epitopes formulated with Th2 adjuvants, thus eliminating
the need for a carrier and linkers.
A final conclusion is that the selection of potentially
effective immunogens must not depend solely on transgenic
animal models, but should include immunochemical and
biophysical methods as well. This way there would be an
early indication if these antigens would be recognized by the
human immune system and thus capable of inducing the
production of protective antibodies. Hence, the initial
selection may be confirmed after in vivo using various
animal models. Actually, the objective of vaccines for
proteinopathies like AD should be to stimulate an immune
response that mimics the natural protective immunity, rather
than trying to replace it with unproven alternatives.
