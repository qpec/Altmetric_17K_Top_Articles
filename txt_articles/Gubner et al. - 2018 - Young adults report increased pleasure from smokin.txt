Abstract
Background—Among young adults, cigarette smoking is strongly associated with alcohol and 
marijuana use. The present study compared self-reported co-use of cigarettes and alcohol versus 
cigarettes and marijuana among young adults using cross-sectional survey data.
Methods—Participants were young adult cigarette smokers (age 18 to 25) who also reported past 
month alcohol or marijuana use enrolled in a randomized trial testing a smoking cessation 
intervention on Facebook. Participants self-reported extent of cigarette smoking under the 
influence of alcohol or marijuana and differences in perceived pleasure from cigarette smoking 
when drinking alcohol compared to using marijuana.
Results—Among cigarette smokers who drank alcohol and used marijuana in the past month 
(n=200), a similar percentage of cigarettes were smoked under the influence of alcohol (42.4%
±31.2%) and marijuana (43.1% ±30.0%). Among alcohol + marijuana users, perceived pleasure 
from smoking cigarettes was significantly greater when drinking alcohol versus when using 
marijuana (t(199)=7.05, p<0.001). There was, on average, an increase in perceived pleasure from 
smoking cigarettes when drinking alcohol, though perceived pleasure did not differ by binge 
drinking frequency. In contrast, there was on average no change in perceived pleasure from 
smoking cigarettes when using marijuana. Results from the cigarette smokers who used alcohol + 
marijuana were similar to cigarette smokers who only used alcohol (n=158) or only used 
marijuana (n=54).
Conclusion—Findings highlight greater perceived reward from smoking cigarettes when 
drinking alcohol compared to when using marijuana, informing smoking cessation interventions 
that target users of multiple substances.

Introduction
Cigarette smoking is strongly associated with alcohol use (SAMHSA 2014, 6.30B), and 
smoking is especially common among heavy drinkers and binge drinkers (Bobo & Husten 
2000; Falk et al. 2006; Harrison & McKee 2011; SAMHSA 2014, 6.30B; Weitzman & Chen 
2005). Cigarettes and alcohol can have combined pharmacological effects that can result in a 
heightened reward (Glautier et al. 1996; Perkins et al. 1995; Rose et al. 2004), and may 
contribute to their co-use. Previous research found that young adults reported increased 
pleasure from smoking cigarettes under the influence of alcohol (McKee et al. 2004; Nichter 
et al. 2006; Stromberg et al. 2007), which could be an important factor underlying their co-
use.
The relationship between frequency of binge drinking and pleasure from smoking remains 
unclear. We previously reported differences in tobacco use characteristics among young 
adults who all drank alcohol but differed in binge drinking frequency (Gubner et al. 2016). 
Compared to alcohol use with no binge drinking, frequent binge drinking was associated 
with smoking more cigarettes per day, and greater temptations to smoke in positive affective/
social situations. Other smoking characteristics, such as being a social smoker, were 
associated with any past month binge drinking. We also reported a high rate of cigarette 
smoking on days participants binge drank alcohol (similar to McKee et al., 2004), 
suggesting that cigarettes could have greater rewarding effects when larger amounts of 
alcohol are consumed. For the current study, we examined the hypothesis that greater 
pleasure from smoking cigarettes would be found among individuals who binge drink 
alcohol more frequently, e.g. engage in cigarette smoking when larger amounts of alcohol 
are consumed.
Cigarette smoking and marijuana use are also strongly associated (Agrawal et al. 2012; 
Peters et al. 2012; Ramo et al. 2012; Ramo & Prochaska 2012a). Similar to alcohol, 
marijuana use and dependence are more common among cigarette smokers compared to 
nonsmokers (SAMHSA 2014, 6.9B), and marijuana use is associated with greater nicotine 
dependence and heavier patterns of cigarette smoking among young adults (Agrawal & 
Lynskey 2009; Patton et al. 2006; SAMHSA 2014, 6.9B). The literature on combined effects 
of tobacco and marijuana suggest that shared genetic risk factors and neurobiological 
pathways may explain some overlap in addictive processes for the two substances (Agrawal 
et al. 2010; Balfour & Ridley 2000; Huizink et al. 2010; Lingford-Hughes & Nutt 2003; 
Nestler 2005; Oleson & Cheer 2012; Young et al. 2006). There is evidence that cannabinoid 
receptors may be involved in the rewarding effects of nicotine and that cannabinoid receptor 
agonists may increase the rewarding and reinforcing effects of nicotine (Gamaleddin, et al., 
2012; Ignatowska-Jankowska, et al., 2013; Navarrete et al., 2013; Panlilio et al., 2013). 
Subthreshold doses of Delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and nicotine in combination (but 
not alone) were found to induce a conditioned place preference in mice (Valjent et al., 2002),

 suggesting possible synergistic enhancement on reward processes. Differences between 
cigarette smokers and non-smokers in response to endocannabinoid modulation of reward 
processing in the nucleus accumbens have also been reported (Jansma et a., 2013). 
Behavioral studies have pointed to additional reasons for co-using tobacco and marijuana, 
including to enhance the high from marijuana or to counteract certain effects of marijuana 
(Schauer et al., 2016). However, to date, limited research has examined rewarding effects of 
marijuana and tobacco co-use.
Using cross-sectional survey data, we examined extent of cigarette smoking under the 
influence of alcohol or marijuana and differences in perceived pleasure from cigarette 
smoking when drinking alcohol compared to using marijuana among cigarette smokers who 
used marijuana and alcohol. Hypotheses were: (1) a similar proportion of smoking episodes 
would occur under the influence of alcohol and marijuana; (2) perceived pleasure would 
increase from smoking when drinking alcohol and using marijuana, and not differ across 
substance; and (3) perceived pleasure from alcohol would be greater with more frequent 
binge drinking. Perceived pleasure from smoking when drinking alcohol or when using 
marijuana was also compared between the cigarette smokers who used both marijuana and 
alcohol in the past month and cigarette smokers who only drank alcohol or only used 
marijuana.
Perceived pleasure experienced from smoking cigarettes when drinking alcohol or using 
marijuana could underlie the persistence of use over time and problems with cutting down or 
quitting (Amos et al. 2004; Cook et al. 2012; Leeman et al. 2008). Given the high prevalence 
of co-use of cigarettes with either alcohol or marijuana (SAMHSA 2014, 6.30B, 6.9B) and 
previous research suggesting that co-use is associated with greater nicotine dependence 
potentially undermining smoking cessation (Agrawal & Lynskey 2009; Dani & Harris, 
2005), results of this study could inform the design of specific intervention components 
addressing substance co-use in smoking cessation interventions for young adults.
Methods
Participants and recruitment procedure
The study analyzed baseline survey data from a randomized controlled trial of English 
literate young adults, age 18–25, residing in the United States, who reported smoking at least 
100 cigarettes in their lifetime and currently smoked at least 3 days per week. A full 
description of the study design and protocol is described in Ramo et al., 2015. Because the 
study was designed to examine the efficacy of a Facebook smoking cessation intervention, 
participants also had to use Facebook at least 4 days per week. Recruitment occurred 
between October 2014 and August 2015 through a paid advertising campaign on Facebook. 
Participants were screened for eligibility online, and, if eligible, signed an online University 
of California Institutional Review Board-approved informed consent, and sent proof of 
identity. Verified participants were sent the baseline survey online, assessing demographics, 
smoking, and other health risk behaviors, including alcohol and marijuana use.
Of the 7540 respondents who passed online eligibility screening, 1039 signed online 
consent; 739 (90.3%) sent verification of identity online; and 500 (67.8%) completed a

 baseline assessment. Enrollment rates were consistent with those reported in online smoking 
studies (Cobb et al. 2005; McKay et al. 2008; Swartz et al. 2006).
The primary analyses for the present study used baseline data from a subsample of 
participants (N=200) who reported past 30-day use of both alcohol and marijuana in addition 
to tobacco. Results were also compared to cigarette smokers who only used marijuana 
(n=54) or only drank alcohol (n=158) in the past month.
Measures
Demographic and substance use measures used here have previously demonstrated good 
reliability and validity with young adults (Ramo et al. 2011; 2012b).
Sociodemographics assessed were gender, age, ethnicity, years of education, and annual 
household income.
Participants were asked “Have you smoked at least 100 cigarettes in your life” (yes/no), 
followed by “What is the usual number of cigarettes you smoke in a day,” and “On average, 
how many days in a week do you smoke cigarettes” (Hall et al. 2006).
Participants were asked if they had consumed alcohol in the past 30 days, if “yes,” they were 
also asked to report how often they drank alcohol, how many standard drinks they consumed 
on a typical day, and on how many of the past 30 days they binge drank alcohol. Binge 
drinking was defined as having 4 or more alcoholic drinks for women, 5 or more alcoholic 
drinks for men (NIAAA, 2004).
Marijuana use was assessed as any use in the past 30-day (yes/no).
Participants were asked to report “what percentage of your cigarette smoking episodes 
occurred under the influence of alcohol” and “does your pleasure from smoking cigarettes 
change when you are drinking alcohol” (range =1 [“strong decrease”] to 9 [“strong 
increase”]) based on McKee et al. (2004). These questions were adapted for marijuana.
Data Analysis
Among cigarette smokers who used marijuana and alcohol, extent of co-use (smoking 
cigarettes under the influence of alcohol or marijuana) and perceived pleasure from smoking 
cigarettes when drinking alcohol or using marijuana were compared using paired samples t-
tests. Perceived pleasure from smoking cigarettes when drinking alcohol or using marijuana 
were each tested against the null hypothesis (5 = “no increase or decrease in pleasure”). 
Participants were also grouped based on frequency of binge drinking in the past month (non-
binge, 1–3 days, 4–8 days, or 9+ days) based on Gubner et al. (2016). Perceived pleasure 
from smoking cigarettes when drinking alcohol was compared across the binge drinking 
groups using ANOVAs.
To validate findings in the current study among cigarette smokers who used both marijuana 
and alcohol, results from these individuals were compared to cigarette smokers in the parent 
study who used only marijuana (n=54) or only alcohol (n=158). Statistical analyses were 
performed using SPSS22 (IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY, USA).

 Results
Sample characteristics
The sample of cigarette smokers who used alcohol + marijuana (n=200) was 52.0% male, 
68.0% White, with a mean age of 20.9 ±2.0 (Table 1). Racial/ethnic groups were 
dichotomized (White versus non-White) due to lack of power to examine more detailed 
group differences given the relative small sample size of non-White ethnic groups (3.5% 
African American, 16.0% multiracial). Participants smoked an average of 9.9 ±5.9 cigarettes 
per day on 6.6 ±0.9 days per week, and reported binge drinking on 4.3 ±5.5 days per month.
Cigarette smokers who used alcohol + marijuana were compared to cigarette smokers who 
only used alcohol or only used marijuana on baseline characteristics (Table 1). Cigarette 
smokers who only used alcohol were significantly more likely to be female compared to 
cigarette smokers who used alcohol + marijuana (χ2(1) =7.0; p=0.008). There were no other 
differences for tobacco use or alcohol use characteristics between groups. Cigarette smokers 
who only used marijuana smoked more cigarettes per day (t(356) =2.61, p=0.01) and smoked 
cigarettes on more days per week (t(356) =3.37, p=0.001) than smokers who used alcohol + 
marijuana.
Extent of and pleasure from cigarette smoking with alcohol versus marijuana
Among smokers who used alcohol + marijuana, a similar percentage of overall cigarettes 
smoked was reported under the influence of alcohol (42.4% ±31.2%) compared to marijuana 
(43.1% ±30.0%; t(199)= −0.26, p=0.79). Perceived pleasure from smoking cigarettes was 
greater when drinking alcohol compared to using marijuana (t(199) =7.05, p<0.001; Figure 
1). Individuals reported an increase in perceived pleasure from smoking cigarettes when 
drinking alcohol (7.0 ±2.2 versus null hypothesis 5=“no increase or decrease in pleasure”; 
t(199) =13.0, p<0.001). In contrast, there was on average no change in perceived pleasure 
from smoking cigarettes when using marijuana (5.3 ±2.7, t(199)=1.7, p=0.09). Perceived 
pleasure from smoking cigarettes did not differ by frequency of binge drinking 
(F(3,200)=0.84, p=0.47): non-binge (7.1 ±2.1), 1–3 binge days (6.8 ±2.3), 4–8 binge days (7.0 
±2.1), 9+ binge days (7.6 ±2.2).
Comparison of the alcohol + marijuana smokers to alcohol only or marijuana only smokers
There were no differences between smokers who used both alcohol + marijuana (n=200) and 
smokers who used only alcohol (n=154) on the percentage of cigarettes reported under the 
influence of alcohol (t(357)=0.94, p=0.35) or perceived pleasure from smoking cigarettes 
when drinking alcohol (t(357)=0.15, p=0.88). There were similarly no differences between 
smokers who used alcohol + marijuana compared to smokers who used only marijuana 
(n=54) on percentage of cigarettes under the influence of marijuana (t(252)= 0.29, p=0.77) or 
perceived pleasure from smoking cigarettes when using marijuana (t(252)=1.0, p=0.32 ).
Discussion
Among a sample of young adult cigarette smokers who used both alcohol and marijuana in 
the past month, a similar proportion of cigarette smoking episodes were reported under the

 influence of alcohol and marijuana. In contrast, perceived pleasure from smoking cigarettes 
was only reported to increase when drinking alcohol but not when using marijuana. There 
were no differences between smokers who used alcohol + marijuana compared to smokers 
who used only marijuana or only alcohol on these measures, increasing the validity of the 
findings.
Tobacco and alcohol have been found to have combined pharmacological effects that result 
in greater reward (Glautier et al. 1996; McKee et al. 2004; Perkins et al. 1995; Rose et al. 
2004). In contrast, marijuana and cigarettes may be co-used primarily for reasons other than 
increased pleasure. For example, nicotine may attenuate some of the cognitive impairments 
induced by acute or chronic marijuana use (Viveros et al. 2006) and it has been suggested 
that nicotine may attenuate the sedative effects of marijuana (Ream et al. 2008). A recent 
qualitative study examining the effects of cigarette smoking on the perceived effects of 
marijuana use found certain individuals reported smoking cigarettes to intensify the 
marijuana high, while others reported not liking the combined effects as it made them feel 
dizzy or nauseous (Schauer et al., 2016). Combined effects of marijuana use and cigarette 
smoking seem to vary by user, and may not be as uniform as the combined effects of alcohol 
and cigarettes.
Since the main route of administration for marijuana is smoking, some aspects of marijuana 
use (e.g., smoke, lighting of a joint, throat feeling when inhaling smoke) may serve as cues 
that increase urges to smoke cigarettes (Agrawal et al. 2012; Shadel et al. 2004; Veilleux & 
Skinner 2015). In addition certain individuals may enjoy aspects of smoking in general, 
regardless of substance (Schauer et al., 2016). Previous studies have found that urges to use 
marijuana and tobacco were correlated among young adults (Ramo et al. 2014) and that 
using tobacco subsequent to marijuana (called “chasing”) is a common pattern of use (Ream 
et al. 2008). The primary route of marijuana administration is smoking, often mixed with 
tobacco (Baggio et al., 2014). Route of marijuana administration could play a role in 
differences in perceived pleasurable effects of smoking cigarettes when using marijuana. 
Research is needed to compare reasons for use and effects of cigarette smoking between 
different routes of marijuana administration (e.g. smoking, vaping, or eating).
Both the non-binge drinkers and all binge drinking frequency groups reported an increase in 
perceived pleasure from smoking cigarettes when drinking alcohol, suggesting that 
frequency of binge drinking and binge drinking itself may not be essential to the relationship 
between enhanced pleasure from smoking during alcohol consumption. Greater pleasurable 
effects of smoking cigarettes when drinking alcohol may occur with lower levels of alcohol 
consumption. Alcohol has biphasic stimulant and sedative effects, and nicotine has been 
found to attenuate the sedative/hypnotic effects of heavy alcohol consumption (Perkins et al. 
2000, Ralevski et al. 2012). Attenuation of sedative effects may be a motivation for the co-
use of tobacco and alcohol most relevant to binge drinking.
Limitations
There are several limitations of this work. We used retrospective self-reported data which 
may be biased and cannot establish a causal inference between alcohol and marijuana use 
and perceived pleasure from smoking cigarettes. Laboratory-based human pharmacology

 studies or intensive longitudinal event-level designs (e.g., Ecological Momentary 
Assessment), are needed to replicate our findings and advance this area of research. We did 
not assess the overlap between cigarettes smoked when both drinking alcohol and using 
marijuana, mode of marijuana use (e.g., smoked, vaporized, digested), or marijuana use 
frequency. This last limitation is especially important, since the relationships between 
marijuana and tobacco use and reasons for co-use may vary as a function of frequency of use 
(Schauer et al., 2016). We also focused exclusively on the enhancement of perceived 
pleasure of smoking cigarettes by alcohol or marijuana rather than the ability of cigarettes to 
enhance the pleasurable effects of other substances. Previous work by McKee et al. (2004) 
suggests the direction we assessed was likely to be more affected, with individuals deriving 
more pleasure from smoking cigarettes while drinking compared to pleasure from drinking 
alcohol when smoking cigarettes (McKee et al., 2004). It should be noted that we asked 
participants to distinguish pleasurable effects of smoking cigarettes from effects of other 
psychoactive substances (alcohol and marijuana) they co-used and we do not know how well 
participants were able to reliably do this. However differences in the reported pleasurable 
effects of alcohol on cigarettes compared to cigarettes on alcohol suggest that individuals are 
able to differentiate the effects of one substance on another (McKee et al., 2004). Future 
studies might also investigate reasons for and expectancies of substance co-use in addition to 
perceived pleasure (Montgomery & Ramo, 2017; Ramo et al., 2013; Rohsenow et al., 2005; 
Schauer et al., 2016). Lastly, our sample comprised young adult smokers participating in a 
Facebook smoking cessation intervention, which may limit the generalizability of the 
results; however given that 90% of all US young adults use social media (Perrin et al. 2015), 
this concern is limited.
Conclusions
Retrospective self-reported perceived pleasure from smoking cigarettes was greater when 
drinking alcohol versus when using marijuana. There may be important differences in why 
cigarettes are co-used with alcohol compared to marijuana and how pleasure from co-use is 
perceived. Targeting the increased pleasure from smoking cigarettes when drinking alcohol 
could enhance effectiveness of smoking cessation interventions among young adults who 
drink alcohol, regardless of binge drinking frequency or marijuana use. In contrast, it may be 
more important to target other reasons for co-use of tobacco and marijuana.
