Key points
r Women born small are at an increased risk of developing pregnancy complications. Stress may
further increase a woman’s likelihood for an adverse pregnancy.
r Adverse pregnancy adaptations can lead to long-term diseases even after her pregnancy.
r The current study investigated the effects of stress during pregnancy on the long-term adrenal,
metabolic and cardio-renal health of female rats that were born small.
r Stress programmed increased adrenal Mc2r gene expression, a higher insulin secretory response
to glucose during intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test (+36%) and elevated renal creatinine
clearance after pregnancy.
r Females that were born small had increased homeostatic model assessment-insulin resistance
and elevated systolic blood pressure after pregnancy, regardless of stress exposure.
r These findings suggest that being born small or being stressed during pregnancy programs
long-term adverse health outcomes after pregnancy. However, stress in pregnancy does not
exacerbate the long-term adverse health outcomes for females that were born small.
Abstract Females born small are more likely to experience complications during their pregnancy,
including pregnancy-induced hypertension, pre-eclampsia and gestational diabetes. The risk of
developingcomplicationsisincreasedbystressexposureduringpregnancy.Inaddition,pregnancy
complications may predispose the mother to diseases after pregnancy. We determined whether
stress during pregnancy would exacerbate the adrenal, metabolic and cardio-renal dysfunction of
growth-restricted females in later life.Lategestation bilateraluterinevesselligation was performed
in Wistar Kyoto rats to induce growth restriction. At 4 months, growth-restricted and control
female offspring were mated with normal males. Those allocated to the stressed group had physio-
logical measurements [metabolic cage, tail cuff blood pressure, intraperitoneal glucose tolerance
test (IPGTT)] conducted during pregnancy whilst the unstressed groups were unhandled. After
the completion of pregnancy, dams were aged to 12 months and blood pressure, and metabolic
and renal function were assessed. At 13 months, adrenal glands, pancreases and plasma were
collected at post-mortem. Females stressed during pregnancy had increased adrenal Mc2r gene
expression (+22%), higher insulin secretory response to glucose during IPGTT (+36%) and
higher creatinine clearance (+29%, indicating increased estimated glomerular filtration rate).
In contrast, females that were born small had increased homeostatic model assessment-insulin
resistance (+54%), increased water intake (+23%), urine output (+44%) and elevated systolic
blood pressure (+7%) regardless of exposure to stress. Our findings suggest that low maternal
birth weight and maternal stress exposure during pregnancy are both independently detrimental
for long-term adrenal, metabolic and cardio-renal health of the mother, although their effects
were not exacerbated.

Introduction
Pregnancy is one of the greatest physiological challenges
that
a
woman
can
experience
in
her
life,
as
it
involves significant metabolic, renal and cardiovascular
adaptations to support the growth of the developing
fetus (Torgersen & Curran, 2006; Weissgerber & Wolfe,
2006). This challenge often unmasks a myriad of under-
lying health conditions which may impact not only
on the health of the developing fetus, but also on
the health of the mother during and after pregnancy.
Stress often acts as a catalyst in the development of
complications during pregnancy (L´
aszl´
o et al. 2015;
Oni et al. 2015), with these health problems potentially
persisting well after pregnancy concludes (Damm, 2009;
Hermes et al. 2013). Although the impact of maternal
stress leading to hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA)
axis dysregulation (Entringer et al. 2009; Jellyman et al.
2015; O’Sullivan et al. 2015) and altered in utero
development (Fowden et al. 2015) of the offspring has
been well characterised, its effects on long-term maternal
health outcomes remain largely unknown. Interestingly,
both the risk of developing pregnancy complications
and the permanent disease outcomes in females can be
programmed whilst in utero.
A reduced birth weight is often used as a surrogate
marker of impaired fetal development. Low birth weight,
which is often caused by intrauterine growth restriction
(IUGR), affects �10% of all pregnancies (Martin
et al. 2011, 2013). In the Western world, IUGR is
most commonly caused by uteroplacental insufficiency,
which impairs blood flow through the uterine vessels
and disrupts oxygen and nutrient supply to the fetus
(Henriksen & Clausen, 2002). Low birth weight increases
the risk of developing metabolic, renal and cardiovascular
diseases (Gluckman et al. 2007). There is evidence to
suggest that females who are small at birth are at a
greater risk of adverse pregnancy adaptations including
gestational diabetes and pre-eclampsia (Innes et al. 2002;
Zetterstr¨
om et al. 2007; ´
a Rogvi et al. 2012).
We have previously investigated the impact of being
born small on maternal physiology in a rat model
of uteroplacental insufficiency. Our findings revealed
that females that were born small had compensatory
glomerular hypertrophy but normal renal physiology
during pregnancy (Gallo et al. 2012b). However, female
growth-restricted rats developed glucose intolerance for
the first time during pregnancy, despite compensatory
increases in pancreatic β-cell mass and normal first and
second phase insulin responses (Gallo et al. 2012b).
Previous research has demonstrated that women who
develop gestational diabetes have faster deterioration in
insulin sensitivity and compensatory pancreatic β-cell
function after pregnancy compared to women who did
not develop gestational diabetes (Xiang et al. 2013). Other
studies have reported that women who develop gestational
diabetes have an increased lifetime risk of developing
overt diabetes (Kim et al. 2002; Damm, 2009) and their
health can be further compromised by second-hits such
as obesity (Lauenborg et al. 2005). As our model of
uteroplacental insufficiency programs glucose intolerance
in pregnancy, we investigated the long-term consequences
of maternal glucose intolerance on maternal health after
pregnancy. However, our studies in the rat have not
established any association between maternal low birth
weight and long-term impairment of maternal metabolic
health following pregnancy (Tran et al. 2012), suggesting
that additional risk factors such as stress exposure during
pregnancy may be necessary to unmask long-term disease
after pregnancy.
Intriguingly, by performing physiological measures to
characterise physiological adaptations during pregnancy,
we observed detrimental effects on fetal growth whereby
fetuses whose mothers were born small and had
physiological measurements performed throughout her
pregnancy were lighter than their counterparts during
late gestation (Gallo et al. 2012b). We concluded that this
series of measurements caused a ‘second-hit’ of stress in
the pregnant dams that were small at birth, ultimately
compromising growth of the developing fetuses. However,

long-term effects on the mothers’ health have not been
investigated. As stress often acts as a catalyst for pregnancy
complications, we aimed to investigate if stress during
pregnancy could contribute to maternal disease after
pregnancy in both normally grown and growth-restricted
females. We hypothesised that stress during pregnancy
would lead to sustained and long-term impairments
in maternal health after pregnancy which would be
exacerbated in females that were born small.
Methods
Animal procedures
All experiments were approved by The University
of Melbourne Animal Ethics Committee (Ethics no.
1011865) and were conducted in accordance with
the Australian Code of Practice for the Care and
Use of Animals for Scientific Purposes. The following
experiments comply with the policies and regulations
of The Journal of Physiology described by Grundy
(2015). Female Wistar Kyoto rats were housed in an
environmentally controlled room and allocated into a
Control (sham surgery) or Restricted (uteroplacental
insufficiency) group. Pregnant dams were anaesthetised
with 4% isoflurane and 650 ml min−1 oxygen flow
(reduced to 3.2% isoflurane and 250 ml min−1 oxygen
flow when suturing). Uteroplacental insufficiency surgery
was performed to induce growth restriction by bilateral
uterine artery and vein ligation on embryonic day 18
(E18) of pregnancy (term E22) as previously described
(O’Dowd et al. 2008). Following surgical procedures,
animals were monitored until fully awake and alert and
then checked hourly for 6–8 h. Visual checks (eyes
clear, no secretions, smooth hair, normal behaviour) were
made to ensure full recovery. Pregnant rats were allowed
to deliver naturally at term and birth weights of F1
female offspring were recorded. Two female offspring per
litter from both the Control and the Restricted groups
(n = 12 litters per group) were used for subsequent
studies. One of each of these two females was allocated
to an Unstressed pregnancy or a Stressed pregnancy
and mated with a normal male at 17–23 weeks. Those
allocated to the Stressed group were subjected to a series
of physiological measurements as previously described
(Gallo et al. 2012b) while their Unstressed counter-
parts were left unhandled except for husbandry purposes
throughout pregnancy. Briefly, this comprised a tail cuff
blood pressure measurement (E18), non-fasted intra-
peritoneal glucose tolerance test (IPGTT) (E18) and 24 h
metabolic cage experiment (E19). A subset of animals
were anaesthetised at E20 with an intraperitoneal injection
of ketamine (100 mg kg body weight−1) and Illium
Xylazil-20 (30 mg kg body weight−1) and a cardiac
puncture performed for the rapid collection of plasma
for corticosterone analysis (no other parameters were
measured at this age) while all remaining females from
all groups delivered naturally at term.
Post-pregnancy physiological measurements
Body weights of F1 Control and Restricted females were
measured at postnatal days 1, 7, 14 and 35 and 4 months
and after Unstressed and Stressed pregnancies at 7, 9 and
12 months and at post-mortem (13 months). Tail cuff
blood pressure was measured at 6, 9 and 12 months using
the protocol previously described (Gallo et al. 2012b).
At 12 months of age, F1 females were fasted overnight
before insulin challenge (IC). A tail vein blood sample
(300 μl) was taken before and 20, 40, 60 and 90 min after
a subcutaneous bolus injection of insulin (Actrapid, Novo
Nordisk Pharmaceuticals, North Rocks, NSW, Australia;
1 U kg body weight−1). A week later, a fasted IPGTT
was performed. Blood samples were collected via tail slice
5 min prior to and at 5, 10, 20, 30, 45, 60, 90 and 120 min
following an intraperitoneal bolus injection of 50% (w/v)
glucose (Pharmalab, Lane Cove, NSW, Australia; 1 g kg
body weight−1) as previously described (Siebel et al. 2008;
Laker et al. 2011). Plasma was stored at –20°C until further
analysis.
Plasma glucose and insulin concentrations were mea-
sured in duplicate using enzymatic fluorometric analysis
and a rat insulin radioimmunoassay kit (Millipore,
Abacus ALS, Brisbane, QLD, Australia), respectively, as
describedpreviously(Siebeletal.2008;Wadleyetal.2008).
Fastingplasmaglucoseandinsulinwastakenastheaverage
oftwotimepoints(10and5minbeforeinjection).Glucose
and insulin area under the curve (AUC) were calculated
as the total area under curve from basal to 120 min for an
IPGTT and glucose AUC from basal to 90 min for an IC
(Matthews et al. 1990). The insulin-to-glucose ratio was
calculated by dividing the total insulin AUC by the total
glucose AUC. First phase insulin secretion during IPGTT
was calculated as the incremental area under the insulin
curve from basal to 5 min whilst second phase insulin
secretion was calculated as the incremental area under the
insulin curve from 5 to 120 min (Siebel et al. 2008; Laker
et al. 2011). Homeostasis model assessment for insulin
resistance (HOMA-IR) was calculated using the following
formula: fasting plasma insulin (μU ml−1) × fasting
plasma glucose (mmol l−1) ÷ 22.5 (Matthews et al.
1985).
One week after IPGTT, female rats were weighed
and individually placed in metabolic cages for 24 h
measurements of food and water intake and urine
production. Measurements of urinary albumin, total
protein, sodium, potassium, creatinine and plasma
creatinine were performed using a COBAS Integra 400
(Roche Diagnostics, Castle Hill, NSW, Australia). Plasma
samples were collected from tail vein blood samples

collected immediately upon the conclusion of 24 h
metcage sampling and analysed for creatinine to be used
in creatinine clearance calculations [urinary creatinine
(μmol l−1) × 24 h urine production (ml)]÷[plasma
creatinine–1 (μmol l−1) × 1440 (min)].
Post-mortem tissue collection
Two weeks after IPGTT, rats were anaesthetized with
an intraperitoneal injection of ketamine (100 mg kg
body weight−1) and Illium Xylazil-20 (30 mg kg body
weight−1) and a cardiac puncture was performed for
the rapid collection of plasma for corticosterone analysis.
Adrenal glands, pancreas, kidneys, heart, liver and dorsal
white adipose tissue were excised and weighed, then snap
frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80°C. A piece of
pancreatic tissue (�1 cm) from the head of the pancreas
was fixed in 10% neutral buffer formalin for histological
analysis.
Plasma corticosterone concentrations were measured
both at E20 and at 13 months using 10 μl of plasma
using a radioimmunoassay as described (Cuffe et al.
2014).
Pancreatic islet, β-cell morphology
and immunohistochemistry
Pancreatic tissue was exhaustively sectioned at 5 μm.
Three sections of equal distance apart were selected and
immunostained and random systematic point counting
used to determine relative islet and β-cell volume density
to determine the absolute islet and β-cell mass as
previously described (Bonner-Weir, 2001; Laker et al.
2011).
RT2 profiler PCR array analysis and Western blotting
Total RNA and protein were extracted from whole adrenal
glands as described previously (Cuffe et al. 2012). In
total, 200 ng of RNA was reverse transcribed using the
RT2 First Strand cDNA synthesis kit (Qiagen, Melbourne,
Australia).mRNAlevelsofmelanocortin2receptor(Mc2r,

(qPCR) on RT2 Profiler Arrays (Qiagen, Cat. No. 330131).
mRNA levels were normalised to the average of the
Unstressed Control group and determined using the
comparative CT (2−��CT) method.
In total, 20 μg of denatured protein was loaded per
sample for analysis of relative protein expression using
SDS-PAGE and Western blotting as described previously
(Cuffe et al. 2011). Membranes were incubated over-
night with either a rabbit anti-MC2R (1: 500, Santa
Cruz Biotechnology, Cat. No. sc-13107, Santa Cruz, CA,
USA) or rabbit anti-STAR (1:1000, Abcam, Cat. No.
ab96637, Melbourne, VIC., Australia) antibody. A mouse
anti-β-actin (1:10,000, Sigma-Aldrich, Cat. No. A5441,
Castle Hill, NSW, Australia) antibody was used as loading
control. Blots were incubated for 1 h with LI-COR
(LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE, USA) IRDye 680 goat
anti-rabbit and IRDye 800CW goat anti-mouse secondary
antibodies. Protein expression was quantified using a
LI-COR Odyssey infrared imaging system.
Statistical analysis
All data were analysed using a two-way ANOVA to assess
the main effects of uteroplacental insufficiency (Group)
and maternal stress (Stress) or Student’s unpaired t test. If
significant interactions were observed, Student’s unpaired
t test was performed to compare individual group means.
All data are presented as means ± SEM and P < 0.05 was
considered statistically significant.
Results
Body and organ weights
Uteroplacental insufficiency in F0 females reduced F1
female weights (–16%) at postnatal day 1 (P < 0.01;
Table 1). Restricted females remained lighter at postnatal
days 7, 14 and 35 (P < 0.01; Table 1) and at mating
(4 months; P = 0.023; Table 1). Following pregnancy,
F1 females that were born small remained lighter at 7
and 9 months (PGroup < 0.01; Table 1) and post-mortem
at 13 months (PGroup = 0.03; Table 1), regardless of
stress exposure during pregnancy. At 12 months, only
Restricted females that were Unstressed during pregnancy
were lighter than control counterparts (P = 0.02; Table 1).
Relative pancreas, liver, dorsal white adipose tissue, heart,
kidney and adrenal weights were not affected by F1 growth
restriction or maternal stress (Table 1).
Corticosterone, adrenal steroidogenic gene
and protein expression
Corticosterone concentrations at E20 were increased in
Stressed pregnant females (PStress = 0.008; Fig. 1A). Plasma
collected at post-mortem at 13 months revealed that
while corticosterone concentrations were reduced by 45%,
this did not reach statistical significance (PStress = 0.054;

Fig. 1B). Females that were exposed to stress during their
pregnancy had increased adrenal mRNA expression of
Mc2r (+22%; PStress = 0.026; Fig. 1C). Although MC2R
protein levels were also increased by 22% in those females
exposed to stress during pregnancy (Fig. 1E), this did
not reach statistical significance (PStress = 0.12). Neither
maternal stress during pregnancy nor uteroplacental
insufficiency had any effect on adrenal Star (Fig. 1D),
Cyp21a1, Cyp11b1, Cyp11b2, Hsd11b2, Agtr1b, Pnmt, Igf1r
and Th gene expression (Table 2).
Metabolic function
Plasma glucose concentrations were not different between
Control and Restricted groups or Unstressed and Stressed
groups (Fig. 2A and B) during IPGTT at 12 months.
Similarly, insulin secretion in response to IPGTT was
not affected by uteroplacental insufficiency or stress
(Fig. 2C and D). However, the insulin secretory response
to glucose, expressed as the ratio of area under the
insulin curve (AUIC) to area under the glucose curve
(AUGC), was increased in females that experienced
stress during pregnancy compared to Unstressed females
(+36%; PStress = 0.037), but was not different between
Control and Restricted groups (Fig. 2E). HOMA-IR
was increased in females that were born small (+54%;
PGroup = 0.012) independent of stress exposure (Fig. 2F),
indicating impaired basal hepatic insulin sensitivity. First
and second phase insulin secretory responses to IPGTT
were not different across groups (Table 3).
Post-pregnancy fasting plasma glucose, insulin and the
ratio of fasting insulin to glucose were not affected by
stress during pregnancy or being born small (Table 3).
Whole-body insulin sensitivity determined through the
glucose AUC response to an insulin challenge was not
influenced by low birth weight or stress during pregnancy
(Table 3). Absolute and relative pancreatic β-cell and islet
mass were not different across groups (Table 3). Similarly,
islet proportion per pancreas was unchanged between
groups (Table 3).
Cardio-renal function
At 12 months of age, Restricted females consumed more
water (+23%; PGroup = 0.018; Fig. 3A) that was associated
with higher 24 h urine output compared to Control
counterparts (+12%; PGroup = 0.013; Fig. 3B). Subsequent
posthocanalysesrevealedthaturineflowratewasincreased
in Unstressed Restricted (+44%; P = 0.005) and Stressed
Control (+34%; P = 0.005) animals when compared to
Unstressed Control (Fig. 3B). Food intake was similar
across all groups over a 24 h period (Table 4). Urinary
excretion of total protein, albumin, sodium and potassium
were not different regardless of growth restriction or
maternal stress (Fig. 3E, F and Table 4). However, urinary
creatinineexcretionwasincreasedinUnstressedRestricted
(+32%; P = 0.017) and Stressed Control females (+35%;
P = 0.026) when compared to Unstressed Control females
(Fig. 3C). Creatinine clearance, which is indicative of
estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), was increased

regardless of their birth weight (+29%; PStress = 0.031;
Fig. 3D).
Systolic blood pressure was not different between
Control and Restricted females in Unstressed and Stressed
groups at 6 and 9 months (Table 4). At 12 months,
Restricted females had increased systolic blood pressure
compared to Control females (+7%; PGroup = 0.01;
Table 4). Subsequent post hoc analysis revealed that
Restricted females that were Unstressed had higher blood
pressure compared to Controls (+10%; +12 mmHg;
P < 0.012), but this was not observed between Control
and Restricted females that were exposed to stress.
Discussion
We have previously demonstrated that growth-restricted
female rats develop glucose intolerance for the first time
during pregnancy without any impact on cardiovascular
or renal function (Gallo et al. 2012b). Interestingly,
the glucose intolerance observed did not persist after
pregnancy (Tran et al. 2012), but cardiovascular and renal
function was impaired (Gallo et al. 2012a). As stress is
known to unmask various pregnancy complications, this
led us to hypothesise that stress during pregnancy could
act as a ‘second-hit’ in addition to growth restriction,
and may unmask long-term adrenal, metabolic and
cardio-renal outcomes in the mothers. Here, we report
that stress in pregnancy resulted in impaired adrenal
steroidogenesis and insulin secretory response to glucose
during IPGTT in mothers after pregnancy. Furthermore,
creatinine clearance was increased suggesting renal hyper-
filtration in females that were stressed during pregnancy,
regardless of their birth weight. In contrast, females born
small at birth had different metabolic and cardio-renal
dysfunction after pregnancy regardless of whether they
experienced stress during pregnancy. Hepatic insulin
sensitivity was reduced if mothers were born small.
In addition, blood pressure, water intake and urine
output were elevated at 12 months in Restricted mothers
independent of stress. These specific phenotypes observed
following pregnancy were not present during pregnancy,
but it is likely that the other pregnancy complications
we have previously demonstrated in females born small
contributed to the long-term development of these
outcomes. Our study demonstrated for the first time that
stress during pregnancy induced through routine physio-
logical measurements can independently lead to health
complications in rats. It is thus important for investigators
studying physiological outcomes using these techniques
to consider it as an additional stressor in their studies.
Importantly, the effects of maternal stress exposure during
pregnancy were not additive to the effects of being born
small and appeared to act independently, which was
contrary to our initial hypothesis.
Corticosterone and adrenal steroidogenesis
The elevated corticosterone concentrations observed at
day 20 of pregnancy confirmed that conducting physio-
logical measurements (tail cuff blood pressure, glucose
tolerance test, metabolic cage experiment) resulted in
moderate maternal stress as expected. The 48% increase in
corticosterone concentrations observed was slightly lower
than concentrations demonstrated following maternal
corticosterone administration (Cuffe et al. 2012; Vaughan
et al. 2012) but similar to exposure to a hypoxic stress
(Cuffe et al. 2014) in the mouse. Intriguingly, 8 months
after pregnancy, plasma corticosterone concentrations
tended to decrease (–45%) in mothers that were exposed
to stress during pregnancy. This suggests impaired adrenal
glucocorticoid output (Moisiadis & Matthews, 2014). To
investigate this further, the expression of several key genes
involved in steroidogenesis were examined. While factors
other than that examined may have been affected by
stress in pregnancy, the only gene found to be affected
by stress was Mc2r, which was elevated in mothers
that experienced stress during their pregnancy 9 months

earlier. This highlights the long-term impact of stress
on HPA axis function, as Mc2r encodes the adreno-
corticotropic hormone (ACTH) receptor, which regulates
overall adrenal corticosterone synthesis (Moisiadis &
Matthews, 2014). This compensatory change in gene
expression was mirrored by similar increases in protein

studied, exposure to glucocorticoids in utero has been
known to program increased corticosterone production
in association with elevated Mc2R mRNA expression in
the offspring (Waddell et al. 2010). Additionally, it would
be beneficial for future studies to subject these females to
a stressful challenge to determine if the HPA axis response
to acute stress may be impaired.
Metabolic function
Interestingly, both growth restriction and stress during
pregnancy independently led to metabolic dysfunction
after pregnancy although there were distinct differences in
metabolicprofilesdependingontheparametersmeasured.
We have previously demonstrated that females born small
develop glucose intolerance for the first time during
pregnancy (Gallo et al. 2012b), which was not sustained
following pregnancy (Tran et al. 2012). Here, we hypo-
thesised that an additional hit of stress during pregnancy
may lead to long-term metabolic disturbances. However,
we observed that hepatic insulin resistance, reflected
by HOMA-IR, increased in mothers that were born
small but was not affected by stress during pregnancy.
Often used in epidemiological studies as an index of
insulin resistance, HOMA-IR in rats has been shown to
correlate well with insulin sensitivity as assessed by the
gold standard euglycaemic–hyperinsulinaemic clamp for
assessing in vivo insulin sensitivity (Cacho et al. 2008).
Furthermore, the close to significant increase in basal
fasting insulin concentrations supports the fact that these
growth-restricted females have developed some degree of
insulin resistance. In contrast, mothers that were exposed
to stress during pregnancy had an increased ratio of
AUIC to AUGC in response to an IPGTT regardless of
birth weight, indicating that they had increased insulin
secretory response to glucose. However, this was not
attributed to changes in pancreatic β-cell or islet mass,
as they were similar across groups. This may be due to
either impaired insulin secretory capacity of individual
pancreatic islets or reduced insulin-stimulated glucose
uptake in metabolic tissues. Corticosterone is known to
stimulate glucose release and suppress glucose utilisation,
which together result in increased plasma glucose (Kuo
et al. 2013). As such, the 45% reduction in plasma cortico-
sterone concentrations in dams exposed to stress during
pregnancy may have maintained glucose concentrations
within the normal physiological range.
Wehavepreviouslyreportedasustainedandheightened
plasma glucose concentration up to 120 min during
IPGTT in females after pregnancy (Tran et al. 2012), and
we again observe that plasma glucose concentrations did
not return to basal after 120 min in the current study. The
delay in glucose returning to basal concentrations could
be attributed to advanced age, as ageing is often associated
with insulin resistance and glucose intolerance (DeFronzo,
1979; Qiang et al. 2007). It is possible that studying these
females at this later age of 12 months may have masked
any effects of growth restriction or maternal stress on these
parameters as even the females from the control groups
may have developed disease outcomes.
Furthermore, the fact that our growth-restricted
females did not become overweight or obese may
have protected them against developing overt metabolic
phenotypes. Uteroplacental insufficiency resulted in
female offspring that were born small and remained
slightly small throughout life although by 12 months of
age this deficit was less than 5%. This suggests catch-up
growth during the postnatal period, but it is important to

note that these rats did not become obese. Inappropriate
catch-up growth after birth is known to increase risk of
developingmetabolicandcardiovascularoutcomeslaterin
life in both the human population and in rodents (Fors´
en
et al. 2000; Hales & Ozanne, 2002; Barker et al. 2005; Gallo
et al. 2013). If these females became obese, it may well
unmask more severe disease phenotypes, and those pre-
viously programmed either through growth restriction or
the experience of a stressful pregnancy may respond to this
additional stressor in a different manner.

hyperfiltration
to
compensate for the increased renal demands during
pregnancy regardless of their birth weight (Gallo et al.
2012b). Following the conclusion of pregnancy, eGFR
returned to normal (Gallo et al. 2012a). In the current
study, we again observed no effect of growth restriction
on eGFR following pregnancy. However, we demonstrated
that exposure to stress during pregnancy resulted in higher
creatinine clearance and thus eGFR 8 months after the
conclusion of pregnancy. Although a low GFR is usually
the hallmark of chronic kidney disease (Levey et al. 2010;
Johnson et al. 2012), an increased GFR suggests hyper-
filtration and is an early indication of renal insufficiency
(Palatini et al. 2012). If these females continue to progress
towards more severe renal phenotypes, chronic kidney
disease may eventually emerge. Mothers born small also
had increased urinary albumin excretion, although this
did not reach significance, supporting our suggestions of
early renal damage. In humans, albuminuria is associated
with cardiovascular risk and increased mortality (Hillege,
2002). Importantly, even a slight increase in albuminuria
is sufficient to increase a person’s risk of cardiovascular
complications (Klausen, 2004). Our findings suggest that
stress during pregnancy reveals renal phenotypes that
persist after pregnancy, with the potential to lead to
long-term and significant renal damage.
We
have
previously
demonstrated
that
growth-
restricted females do not develop elevated systolic blood
pressure even at 18 months of age (Moritz et al. 2009).
Follow-up studies demonstrated these females did not
develop increased blood pressure either when pregnant
(Gallo et al. 2012b) or after pregnancy (Gallo et al. 2012a)
when measured by tail cuff plethysmography, and nor
was it different between virgin and pregnant females
(Gallo et al. 2012a). However, when mean arterial pressure
was assessed through indwelling tail-artery catheter, both
control and growth-restricted females that previously
experience pregnancy had elevated mean arterial pressure
(Gallo et al. 2012a). Our current study supports this, and
at 12 months of age, systolic blood pressure by tail cuff
was elevated in mothers that were born small. Although
statistical analysis suggests that this is an effect of growth
restriction, we believe that the elevated blood pressure
observed in the Restricted group was mainly driven by the
12 mmHg increase in blood pressure only in the Restricted
group that remained unstressed during pregnancy. While
it was hypothesised that stress during pregnancy would
further exacerbate and increase post-pregnancy blood
pressure, this was not observed when measured by tail
cuff. It is important to note that blood pressure can be
regulated by multiple physiological systems, and studies
have demonstrated that offspring of female rodents
exposed to glucocorticoids develop alterations in adrenal
outcomes (Quinn et al. 2014), renal function (Singh
et al. 2007) and blood pressure regulation (O’Sullivan
et al. 2013). It is therefore likely that the impairments in
adrenal and renal function may contribute to the elevated
blood pressure observed in growth-restricted females after
pregnancy. Future studies should include gold standard
blood pressure and GFR measurements through radio-
telemetry and insulin clearance, respectively, which may
reveal changes we were unable to identify. Given the
invasive nature of these techniques and hence the stress it
may cause, separate additional cohorts would be required
to achieve this.
Conclusion
The current study investigated if stress during pregnancy
could lead to long-term health dysfunction in female
rats that were born small. While previous studies
have focused on offspring outcomes following stress in
pregnancy, this is the first time that maternal health has
been investigated. We report that being born small or
being stressed while pregnant independently programmed
impaired the adrenal, metabolic and cardio-renal health
of mothers up to 9 months after pregnancy. Mothers
who experienced stress during pregnancy had higher
insulin secretory response to glucose during IPGTT,
increased eGFR and also increased mRNA expression of
the ACTH receptor Mc2r, while those that were born small

had increased HOMA-IR and elevated blood pressure.
Although multiple physiological systems were impaired,
overt disease was not present in any one system. However,
collectively this may have major implications for the future
health of the mother. This study highlights that mothers
who were small at birth or have experienced stress during
pregnancy may be at a greater risk of developing a broad
range of long-term pathologies, although being affected
by both low birth weight and stress during pregnancy
do not appear to place her at greater risk than those
with only one risk factor. The different mechanisms in
which the two insults act to program future diseases may
explain the different phenotypes we observed, as growth
restriction can result in disease risk being programmed
even prior to these females being born, in contrast to
the acute impact of stress during pregnancy, although
this remains to be elucidated. Given our findings, it is
important that women who experience adverse pregnancy
events be monitored after pregnancy and appropriate
intervention considered, ensuring the best outcomes for
her health during pregnancy and in later life. Follow-up
studies in offspring of these mothers is also warranted
to fully understand the long-term impact of an adverse
pregnancy.
