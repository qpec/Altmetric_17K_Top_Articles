Aims
The aim of this study was to present data on 11 459 patients who underwent total hip 
(THA), total knee (TKA) or unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) between November 
2002 and April 2014 with aspirin as the primary agent for pharmacological 
thromboprophylaxis. 
Patients and Methods
We analysed the incidence of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) 
then compared the 90-day all-cause mortality with the corresponding data in the National 
Joint Registry for England and Wales (NJR). 
Results
The incidence of PE was 0.6% after THA, 1.47% after TKA and 1.2% after UKA. The 90-day 
mortality was 0.39% after THA and 0.44% after TKA. No deaths occurred after UKA. The 
main causes of death were ischaemic heart disease and respiratory failure. PE was 
responsible for only 18% of deaths. There was a decline in 90-day mortality, from 0.64% 
between 2002 and 2007
, to 0.21% between 2008 and 2013 after THA, and from 0.47% to 
0.39% after TKA for the corresponding period. The standardised mortality ratio (SMR) 
declined from 86.5 (confidence interval (CI) 63.0 to 137
.7) to 39.7 (CI 31.2 to 54.3) p = 0.024. 
The incidence of proximal DVT was 0.3%. 
T
ake home message: With individualised risk assessment and as part of a multimodal 
approach, Aspirin is safe to use as the main thromboprophylactic agent in primary 
arthroplasty. It is not associated with an increased incidence of symptomatic DVT
, PE or 
death.

Thromboprophylaxis after lower limb arthro-
plasty remains a topic of considerable debate
among orthopaedic surgeons, and is viewed in
the wider context of public health as a prevent-
able cause of morbidity and mortality. There
remains, however, an underlying tension
between the benefits of pharmacological throm-
boprophylaxis and the risk of clinically impor-
tant post-operative haemorrhage. This has been
further heightened by the recent and widespread
adoption of new oral anticoagulant agents for
which there still is no available antidote.1
It is accepted that individualised risk assess-
ment, spinal anaesthesia, modern surgical
techniques, early mobilisation and a combina-
tion of mechanical and pharmacological
modalities for thromboprophylaxis reduce the
risk of DVT. There remains, however, a lack of
consensus about the ideal pharmacological
agent, that is, one that offers effective throm-
boprophylaxis while minimising the risk of
clinically important bleeding. This is reflected
by significant differences in the guidelines
issued by responsible organisations in different
parts of the developed world.1-4 In the United
Kingdom, the National Institute for Health
and Care Excellence (NICE) has published
guidelines which recommend the use of both
mechanical and pharmacological methods.
They do not recommend the use of aspirin.1
In an editorial piece in this journal, Barrack5
gave an overview of the evolution of thrombo-
prophylaxis in lower limb arthroplasty over
the past 40 years. In 2008 the American Col-
lege of Chest Physicians (ACCP) proposed
guidelines, recommending low molecular
weight heparin (LMWH), fondaparinux or
adjusted-dose warfarin. The use of aspirin as a
sole method of pharmacological thrombo-
prophylaxis was not recommended.6
 In response to concerns about these guide-
lines, the American Academy of Orthopaedic

THE BONE & JOINT JOURNAL
Surgeons (AAOS) established a working group on venous
thromboembolism (VTE), which evaluated the available
data using the endpoints of symptomatic events, specifi-
cally PE and death. A second AAOS working group in 2011
considered symptomatic DVT as well and concluded that
the data available were not adequate to support any of the
commonly used prophylactic measures over the others:
these included LMWH, factor Xa inhibitors, direct-throm-
bin inhibitors, aspirin or pneumatic compression devices.6
A risk stratification approach was recommended with more
aggressive prophylaxis for patients at risk (the major risk
factor being a past history of VTE) and less aggressive
prophylaxis in patients with a known bleeding disorder.3,5
 In response to the AAOS recommendations, the ACCP
reviewed their guidelines in 2012, focusing, as had the
AAOS, on symptomatic VTE and minimising bleeding
complications. The resulting guidelines no longer contained
any high evidence-based recommendations (at the 1A
level7), as there was inadequate evidence from multi-centre
randomised controlled trials with symptomatic events as an
endpoint to justify this.2 All commonly used anticoagu-
lants, including aspirin, were given a 1B recommendation.
Pneumatic compression devices were included at the 1C
level: the use of a mobile device with a monitoring chip
allowing at least ten days of continuous wear was recom-
mended. 
We present the outcomes of a single surgeon series of
patients who underwent primary lower limb arthroplasty
with aspirin as the primary agent for post-operative throm-
boprophylaxis. This is an update of a previously published
series on the incidence of fatal PE in 4253 patients.8
Patients and Methods
We analysed prospectively collected data on 11 459
patients who underwent THA, TKA or UKA between 1
November 2002 and 30 April 2014. All patients were oper-
ated on by, or under the supervision of, a single surgeon
(DB). The data were collected for continuous audit by a
dedicated team of nurses in the Orthopaedic Unit. Data
were complete and accurate for peri-operative and 90-day
morbidity and mortality. All cause 90-day mortality was
cross-referenced with the Northern Ireland Death Register
up to 31 July 2014 to ensure completeness and accuracy.
Data were also collected for the incidence of DVT, PE, early
post-operative wound complications, specifically haema-
toma, dehiscence and infection which necessitated a return
to theatre within 90 days, all of which were treated as pre-
sumed early infection.
The standard protocol from 1 November 2002 was to
use aspirin 150 mg once daily for six weeks from the first
post-operative day. Patients with a previous history of
proximal DVT or PE were given warfarin: LMWH was
used initially until the INR reached the therapeutic range (2
to 2.5). After 2010, our protocol for this group changed to
reflect the NICE guidelines. However, patients who under-
went both TKA and THA received LMWH for 28 days
whereas NICE recommends it for 10 to 14 days after TKA.
An audit of 1001 patients operated on between 29 Febru-
ary 2012 and 25 June 2013 showed that 32 patients (3.2%)
were on warfarin post-operatively and were given LMWH
until the INR reached the therapeutic range. Of the remain-
ing 969 patients, 905 (90.4%) were treated with aspirin, 50
(5.0%) with LMWH and 13 (1.3%) mobilised early with-
out thromboprophylaxisP. Only one patient (0.1%) had
mechanical prophylaxis alone. 
Where possible, all patients had a spinal anaesthetic. Sur-
gery was undertaken using a standard posterior approach for
THA, a midline incision and a modified medial parapatellar
(Insall) arthrotomy9 for TKA and a standard medial
approach for UKA. Unless medically unwell, all patients
were mobilised on the first post-operative day. After Novem-
ber 2012, all patients also used an Intermittent Calf Com-
pression Device (ICCD) unless it was contraindicated. Before
this, mechanical devices were not used. Since their introduc-
tion there have been no pressure-related skin problems. 
All patients were reviewed at six weeks after THA and
UKA and three months after TKA. They were all contacted
within a week of discharge by a member of the nursing
team. The unit also operates an open-door policy with a
dedicated phone line for easy access to advice and early
review in case of post-operative problems. All adverse
events are recorded at each review.
DVT was classified as either proximal or distal. Any
thrombus in the popliteal, femoral or iliac veins was consid-
ered proximal. A clinical diagnosis of DVT was confirmed
by duplex ultrasonography. Following the installation of a
multi-channel CT scanner in our unit in January 2005, PE
was confirmed by CT Pulmonary Angiography (CTPA).
Before this, it was confirmed by ventilation/perfusion (VQ)
scanning. For patients investigated after discharge, there is
a regional picture archiving and communication system
(NIPACS) which allows access to all radiological investiga-
tions undertaken in Northern Ireland since 2006. Before
this, information about post-discharge investigations was
collated by the outcome nurses through telephone contact
with the patients. Treatment with warfarin continued for
three months after a proximal DVT and for six months
after a PE. Distal DVT was not actively treated but the
patients remained on aspirin for six weeks. Fatal PE was
confirmed at post-mortem examination or from death reg-
istry records. Any death from an unknown cause was con-
sidered to be from PE. The 90 day all-cause mortality was
compared with the corresponding data in the National
Joint Register for England and Wales (NJR).10
Statistical analysis. This was undertaken using IBM SPSS
version 22 software (IBM, Armonk, New York). Para-
metric tests were used for continuous variables (Student’s
t-test). Logistic regression was used to determine patient
variables that were significantly associated with mortality
up to 90 days from surgery. The standardised mortality
ratio (SMR) was calculated using asymptotic z-tests with
wide degrees of freedom assumed. In order to reduce poten-

tial errors from multiple testing, the mortality data were
aggregated by year of operation into five groups: 2002 to
2004; 2005 to 2006; 2007 to 2008; 2009 to 2010 and 2011
to 13, the latest calendar year for which there is a published
report on all-cause mortality from the Northern Ireland
Statistics and Research Agency. Mortality was classified
into two groups: one, death within 90 days of surgery and
two, death between 91 and 365 days. The death rates in the
two categories are expressed as SMR relative to the general
population in Northern Ireland. 
A further analysis was done with the cohorts combined
into two approximately equal groups; those who had sur-
gery up to 31 December 2006 and between 1 January 2007
and 31 December 2013. Asymptotic z–tests with wide
degrees of freedom assumed, were once again applied to
these two cohorts. The figures for 2014 are for operations
up to 30 April 2014, less than half of expected procedures
for the whole year. The data for 2014 are therefore
excluded from the analysis.
Results
The operation, gender and mean age of the patients are given
in Figure 1. A total of 1047 patients (9.1%) were ASA 1,
8499 (74.2%) ASA 2 and 1642 (14.3%) ASA 3. ASA data
was not recorded for 257 patients (2.2%). 
Mortality. There were 23 deaths within 90 days of THA
(0.39%), 22 after TKA (0.44%) and none after UKA
(Table I). The 45 day mortality after TKA is included to
allow comparison with the recently published analysis of
NJR data by Hunt et al11 who chose 45 rather than 90 days
because most of the short term deaths seem to have
occurred within this time. Of the 22 deaths in our patients
following TKA, 14 (64%) occurred within 45 days of sur-
gery reflecting a similar trend. 
The cause of death within 90 days as recorded in the
Northern Ireland Death Register is given in Table II. Car-
diac and respiratory complications accounted for > 50% of
deaths. Assuming that death for which no cause was
recorded was due to PE, this condition accounted for less
than one in five deaths (18%). The two factors most
strongly associated with mortality were the age and ASA
grade of the patients. ASA grade may be considered a sur-
rogate marker of comorbidity. 
The SMR and change in mortality over time are shown in
Tables III and IV, respectively. This shows a statistically sig-
nificant reduction in 90-day mortality between 2007 and

2013 compared with that between 2002 and 2006
(p = 0.024). There is a statistically significant increase in
the rate of deaths after 90 days for the 2007 to 2013 cohort
compared with the 2002 to 2006 cohort (p = 0.027). This,
however, remains well below the expected death rate for the
general population. The death rates in the < 90 days and the
91- to 365-day cohorts differ significantly in the 2002 to
2006 period (p = 0.003) but not in the 2007 to 2013 period
(p = 0.84). Using the 91- to 365-day death rates as the
expected mortality after primary lower limb arthroplasty
and assuming 90-day mortality would coalesce towards
that ‘steady state’ over time, it is possible to estimate the
number of ‘excess deaths’ in the early post-operative
period. This is estimated at 16 in the 2002 to 2006 period
but less than one in the post-2006 period, indicating a
reduction in post-operative mortality since 2007, which

cannot be attributed to any specific change in peri-operative
practice and is therefore likely to be multifactorial.
Pulmonary embolism. The incidence of PE was 0.57% after
THA, 1.47%, after TKA and 1.22% after UKA (Table V).
Of the 34 PEs after THA, 29 were diagnosed after installa-
tion of the CT scanner in 2005: 17 (50%) were diagnosed
after discharge from hospital. Of the 80 PEs after TKA and
UKA, 63 (79%) were diagnosed before discharge. 
A total of 17 in-patient CTPAs were done between 2005
and 2007. With the publication of NICE guideline 46,12
there was a dramatic increase in the number of CTPAs, 30
being done in 2008 and 48 in 2009 (Fig. 2). The relative
risk of having an in-hospital CTPA was significantly greater
after TKA than after THA (RR = 5.8, 95% confidence
interval 3.1 to 10.8 p < 0.001) with twice the likelihood of
a positive result.

Proximal DVT. The incidence and annual distribution of
imaging-confirmed symptomatic proximal DVT shows an
overall mean incidence of < 0.5% per year for each of the
three procedures over the 12-year period (Table VI).
Complications. Early complications necessitating a return
to theatre are listed in Table VII. All were treated as pre-
sumed infection. A total of 23 patients (0.39%) who had
undergone THA had a washout, debridement and primary
closure; one had a first-stage revision. Two patients devel-
oped recurrent infection and had a two-stage revision. 
A total of 29 patients (0.53%) who underwent TKA or
UKA had a washout, debridement and primary closure. Six
developed recurrent infection, three had a further washout,
two had a two-stage revision and one had an above-knee
amputation.
Discussion
This study shows that the 90-day mortality after primary
lower limb arthroplasty is low (0.39%) and compares
favourably with the most recent published mortality data
from the NJR of 0.43%.10 An analysis of NJR data by Hunt
et al also showed a decline in 90-day mortality after THA
from 0.56% in 2003 to 0.29% in 2011.13 This decline was
independent of any specific causal factor but was favourably
influenced by the use of spinal anaesthesia, a posterior surgi-
cal approach, mechanical and pharmacological thrombo-
prophylaxis and, to a lesser degree, being overweight.13 
This decrease in mortality is mirrored in our patients
who underwent THA: their mean 90-day mortality
declined from 0.64% between 2002 and 2007 to 0.16%
between 2008 and 2013. We use a spinal anaesthetic as our
primary choice. All THAs are carried out through a poste-
rior approach and, from November 2012, in addition to a
six-week course of 150 mg Aspirin, we have routinely used
in-patient ICCD post-operatively. In a separate analysis of
NJR data on 45-day mortality after 467 779 knee arthro-
plasties, Hunt et al11 once again found a substantial decline
in mortality from 0·37% in 2003 to 0·20% in 2011, even
after adjustment for age, gender and comorbidity, a trend
similarly seen in our patients with respect to 90-day mortal-
ity, which declined from a mean of 0.51% between 2002
and 2007 to 0.42% between 2008 and 2013. Our 45-day
mortality was, however, stable at 0.25% and 0.26%,
respectively. While several comorbid conditions adversely
influenced mortality, modifiable peri-operative risk factors
such as surgical approach and thromboprophylaxis had no
effect. They found that UKA was associated with substan-
tially lower mortality than TKA. In our study, there were no
deaths within 90 days of UKA, although this represents a
relatively small group compared with those of THA and
TKA. 
VTE is viewed as a preventable cause of death and has
been highlighted as a public health problem since the
release of the Parliamentary Health Committee report on
the subject in 2005.14 It is to address the public health con-
cerns and reduce VTE-related mortality and morbidity, that
NICE issued its initial guidelines.12 The implementation of
these guidelines has resulted in the widespread use of
LMWH, pentasaccharide and the newer oral anticoagu-
lants as part of a multimodal approach to thromboprophy-
laxis. Correspondingly there has been a decline in the use of
aspirin and warfarin.10 Our study, in which aspirin was the
primary pharmacological thromboprophylactic agent,
shows no difference in 90-day mortality compared with
NJR data with a corresponding downward trend in overall
mortality over time. 
The Northern Ireland death register shows that the main
causes of death are medical complications with PE identi-
fied as the cause in only 18%. Hunt et al11,12 in their review
of NJR data also found that medical comorbidity, espe-
cially ischaemic heart disease, congestive cardiac failure,
cancer, cerebrovascular disease, renal disease and moder-
ate/severe liver disease had an adverse effect on post-
operative mortality. The decline in overall mortality that we
have seen during the past ten years may, therefore, be the
result of factors such as better pre-operative medical opti-
misation, better anaesthetic and surgical techniques and
improved post-operative care rather than the widespread
adoption of more potent thromboprophylactic agents.
While the objective of preventing VTE to reduce morbid-
ity and mortality is laudable, there is growing concern that
the focus on the prevention of VTE often obscures the fact
that there are other more frequent and clinically important
post-operative complications, some related to the choice of
prophylactic agent. These complications cause significant
morbidity and are often more expensive to treat.15,16

 ASPIRIN FOR THROMBOPROPHYLAXIS AFTER PRIMARY LOWER LIMB ARTHROPLASTY

VOL. 98-B, No. 3, MARCH 2016
With advances in technology, CTPA has become the first
line test for PE. In the United States there was a 14-fold
increase in the use of CTPA with a corresponding 52%
decline in VQ scanning between 2001 and 2008.17 CTPA
has the advantage of being able to detect filling defects as
small as 2 mm to 3 mm in diameter.18 This is reassuring to
clinicians as they are able to avoid missing a PE with some
confidence. There is, however, emerging evidence that the
widespread adoption of CTPA has led to the over-diagnosis
of small sub-segmental PEs that have limited clinical effect
in terms of morbidity and mortality.19-22 Using United
States national administrative data, Wiener et al22 showed
that the age adjusted incidence of PE, which was stable in
the five years before the introduction of multidetector
CTPA, increased by 80% between 1998 and 2006 after it
was introduced. Despite this near doubling of diagnoses,
age-adjusted mortality from PE in the population of the
United States changed minimally from 12.3 to 11.9 per 100
000. The age adjusted fatality of PE (in-hospital deaths),
however, decreased by one-third from 12.1% to 7.8%, sug-
gesting that the extra PEs being detected are less lethal,
given that treatment has not changed significantly.22,23 Our
study reflects a similar trend in both the number of CTPAs
performed and the declining overall mortality. In a meta-
nalysis of symptomatic in-hospital DVT and PE in 44 844
patients, on appropriate but differing agents for thrombo-
prophylaxis, Januel et al24 found an incidence of 1% after
TKA and 0.5% after THA. The higher incidence of in-
hospital DVT and PE after TKA has also been observed by
Douketis et al.25 Our data show that there are four times as
many in-hospital PEs after TKA than after THA. In a study
to determine the incidence of pulmonary artery filling
defects in asymptomatic patients, Gandhi et al26 found a
positive rate of 41% after TKA and 5% after THA. They
concluded that with the newer generation CT scanners, the
frequency of abnormalities that are diagnosed as PE is
increasing and that further studies are required to deter-
mine which filling defects found on CTPA warrant
treatment. 
This study shows that the use of aspirin for thrombo-
prophylaxis does not increase 90-day mortality or throm-
boembolic complications. Indeed there has been a decline in
overall post-operative mortality over the past 11 years in
keeping with similar trends observed in the NJR where
thromboprophylaxis largely reflects current NICE guide-
lines. Aspirin is cheap, historically has a good safety profile
and is taken orally, which probably enhances patient com-
pliance. Our results reflect the ‘real life’ outcomes in a high-
volume arthroplasty unit and, given the low incidence of
symptomatic VTE and mortality, it would be difficult to
recruit sufficient numbers of patients to show any advan-
tage of other thromboprophylactic agents in a prospective
randomised controlled trial. Although this may be viewed
as a weakness of our study, the practical and logistical chal-
lenges of achieving this is evidenced by the dearth of level
1A data in the literature. Evidence from observational
studies in different areas of medicine, although not the gold
standard, has contributed significantly to the enhancement
of public health and strongly influenced the formulation of
public health policy.27 More recently, within orthopaedics,
observational studies of joint registry data helped identify
the early failure of certain metal-on-metal implants leading
to their withdrawal from the market, thereby protecting
many patients from potential harm.10,28
The strengths of our study are that it involves a large
number of patients within a relatively captive population,
all deaths were cross referenced with the regional death reg-
ister to ensure accuracy, the data are prospectively collected
and no patients were lost to follow-up. 
In conclusion, the use of aspirin for pharmacological
thromboprophylaxis in primary lower limb arthroplasty is
safe. Its use is not associated with an increased incidence of
symptomatic DVT, PE or post-operative mortality. It
should therefore be considered, in the setting of individual-
ised risk assessment and use of a multimodal approach, as
an option for VTE thromboprophylaxis.
