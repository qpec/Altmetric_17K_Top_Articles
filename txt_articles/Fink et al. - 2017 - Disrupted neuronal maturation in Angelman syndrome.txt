Angelman syndrome (AS) is a neurogenetic disorder caused by deletion of the maternally
inherited UBE3A allele and is characterized by developmental delay, intellectual disability,
ataxia, seizures and a happy affect. Here, we explored the underlying pathophysiology using
induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons from AS patients and unaffected controls.
AS-derived neurons showed impaired maturation of resting membrane potential and action
potential firing, decreased synaptic activity and reduced synaptic plasticity. These patient-
specific differences were mimicked by knocking out UBE3A using CRISPR/Cas9 or by
knocking down UBE3A using antisense oligonucleotides. Importantly, these phenotypes could
be rescued by pharmacologically unsilencing paternal UBE3A expression. Moreover, selective
effects of UBE3A disruption at late stages of in vitro development suggest that changes in
action potential firing and synaptic activity may be secondary to altered resting membrane
potential. Our findings provide a cellular phenotype for investigating pathogenic mechanisms
underlying AS and identifying novel therapeutic strategies.

 A
ngelman syndrome (AS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder
first described in 1965 by Harry Angelman and is
characterized by developmental delay, language impairment,
intellectual deficits and oftentimes, seizures1,2. In addition, AS
patients have been referred to as ‘Puppet children’ because these
patients present with ataxia, happy affect and frequent bouts of
laughter1,3. The prevalence of AS is estimated at 1/15,000 and is
caused by the loss of the maternal 15q11–q13 chromosomal region4.
The 15q11–13 chromosomal region is regulated by genomic
imprinting, an epigenetic phenomenon in which the expression of
an allele is determined by the parent of origin. AS results from the
loss of function of the UBE3A gene, a gene housed within this
region. Due to genomic imprinting, UBE3A is solely expressed
from the maternal allele in neurons. The paternal allele is silenced
in these cells by the reciprocal expression of a long, non-coding
antisense RNA3. Therefore, the loss of the maternal allele of
UBE3A results in the loss of UBE3A mRNA and protein in
neurons5. The UBE3A gene encodes an E3 ubiquitin ligase
protein, also known as E6-associated protein, a molecule
responsible for tagging target proteins for degradation by the
proteasome. The loss of ubiquitin ligase function in the neurons
of patients with AS could cause the build-up of UBE3A target
proteins that may contribute to disease pathogenesis6.
Potential targets of UBE3A identified in mice include synaptic
proteins such as EPHEXIN-5 and Arc7,8, suggesting that deficits in
synaptic signalling may be involved in AS pathophysiology.
Moreover, the frequent seizure phenotype associated with AS
could result from changes in neuronal excitability or disturbances to
the balance of excitation and inhibition9. Additionally, changes in
intrinsic membrane properties and axon initial segment have also
been reported in AS mouse models10,11. These data, in combination
with findings of impaired synaptic plasticity, altered dendritic
spines, and the cognitive and seizure phenotypes associated with
these models12–16, suggest that neurons from AS patients could
have impairments in neuronal excitability and synaptic activity.
The advent of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology
allows for the generation of patient-specific nervous tissue, which
can be used to model a variety of neurological disorders17. In this
study, we generated iPSC-derived neurons from AS patients and
unaffected control subjects to compare the development of intrinsic
excitability, action potential (AP) firing and excitatory synaptic
activity and synaptic plasticity in these cells. We found that neurons
derived from control subjects show an in vitro maturation of resting
membrane potential (RMP), AP firing and spontaneous synaptic
activity. Neurons derived from AS patients were similar to controls
at early time points, but showed deficits that were generally apparent
by 6–8 weeks in vitro. Specifically, AS-derived neurons showed a
more depolarized RMP, immature AP firing, decreased spontaneous
excitatory synaptic activity and reduced capacity for activity-
dependent synaptic plasticity. Importantly, these differences were
maintained as late as 20 weeks in vitro. These phenotypic differences
can be directly attributed to loss of UBE3A because these differences
were mimicked in control neurons by knocking out UBE3A in an
isogenic CRISPR-Cas9 gene-edited cell line or knocking down
UBE3A with antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) against UBE3A, and
the phenotype could be rescued in AS neurons by pharmacologically
increasing
paternal
UBE3A
expression
with
topoisomerase
inhibition. Furthermore, the selective effects of either disrupting
UBE3A at late stages of in vitro development or mimicking the
altered RMP during in vitro development suggest that changes in AP
firing and synaptic activity may be secondary to altered RMP.
Results
Characterization of AS and control cultures. Cells were plated
via manual dissociation of neurosphere structures following the
generation of embryoid body-like aggregates (Supplementary
Fig. 1d). We used a differentiation protocol that, in the absence of
specific morphogens, leads to a default generation of forebrain
neurons18–20. Similar protocols have been used to generate
cortical neurons and functional synaptic networks21,22. To
determine whether the cellular composition of iPSC-derived
cultures was affected by the AS genotype, we characterized
neuronal
cultures
using
immunocytochemistry
and
flow
cytometry.
For
immunocytochemical
experiments,
cultures
derived from AS and control subjects were fixed at Z5 weeks
in vitro and stained for TUJ1 (b-tubulin), a neuron-specific
microtubule protein, TBR1, a transcription factor specific for
glutamatergic neurons and GAD65/67 or GAD67, markers for
GABAergic neurons. There were no significant differences
between
control
and
AS
cultures
in
the
proportion
of
glutamatergic
neurons
(Fig.
1a;
control:
66.9±6.4%;
AS:
66.1±9.1%)
or
GABAergic
neurons
(Fig.
1a;
control:
24.8±0.7%;
AS:
19.7±1.6%).
We
also
determined
the
percentage of astrocytes present in these cultures by staining for
the nuclear marker 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) and
the mature astrocyte marker S100b. At 17 weeks in vitro, the
proportion of DAPI-positive cells that stained positive for S100b
was not significantly different for AS and control cultures (Fig. 1a;
control: 12.6±2.7%; AS: 11.9±2.8%).
The similarity in cell composition between AS and controls was
confirmed using flow cytometry for these same markers.
As shown in Fig. 1b, the proportions of TBR1, GAD67 and
S100b/GFAP cells were similar to that seen by immunocyto-
chemistry, and again was not different based on genotype. We
also found that cells in both AS and control cultures expressed
markers for upper cortical layers (CUX1 and SATB2) and deep
layers (CTIP2), as well as a population of tyrosine hydroxylase-
positive cells (Fig. 1c). These markers were expressed at similar
levels in control and AS cultures, and this was confirmed by flow
cytometry (Supplementary Fig. 2).
Depolarized resting membrane potential in AS neurons.
Patch-clamp recordings were conducted on nine iPSC lines
derived from three AS patients and four control subjects: two
clones each from one AS patient and one control, and single
clones from the remaining subjects. In addition, a UBE3A
knockout (KO) line was generated from one of the control lines
using
CRISPR/Cas9-mediated
gene
editing
(see
Methods).
All recorded cells underwent current clamp protocols, for
determining RMP and AP firing, as well as voltage clamp
protocols, for monitoring inward and outward currents and
synaptic currents. A developmental time course was generated by
recording weekly from the time of plating (3 weeks post initiation
of differentiation) through week 20 of in vitro development.
Recordings were obtained from at least 15 cells per coverslip and
1–5 coverslips were used per week per genotype.
As shown in Fig. 2a, the mean RMP of control neurons
(from four subjects) and AS-derived neurons (from three
patients) was similar at 3–5 weeks in vitro. However, the RMP
of control neurons showed a subsequent hyperpolarizing shift
during development that was not seen in AS-derived neurons.
RMP in AS neurons was significantly more depolarized than
control neurons over 20 weeks in culture (Fig. 2a). Results from
the individual subjects are shown in the upper right panel of
Fig. 2a. Similar developmental trends in RMP were observed
when comparing neurons derived from two clonal cell lines
derived from a single control patient, and two clones from a
single AS patient (Fig. 2a, lower right). Specifically, the two clonal
lines derived from the control patient showed a developmental
shift in RMP towards more hyperpolarized potentials, which was

 absent in the two clonal lines derived from the AS patient,
suggesting that genotypic differences are not likely due to clonal
variability. Detailed week-by-week analysis for individual patients
and genotype groups is shown in Supplementary Fig. 3a,b.
Due to the heterogeneity of iPSC-derived neurons in culture,
we noted the shape and location of each recorded cell by visual
inspection to investigate whether phenotypic differences were
specific to a particular cell morphology. Cells were categorized
according to three basic shapes—pyramidal, bipolar or multipolar
(Fig. 2b). In addition, cells were classified according to location
within the culture: mound, near mound and sparse (Fig. 2b).
Mound cells were those located on the initial clusters of cells
generated by neurosphere dissociation, near mound represents
cells that migrated away from the mound but still extended
processes into the dense mound structures and sparse represents
groups of cells that were in areas devoid of mounds. As shown
in the right panel of Fig. 2b, the hyperpolarizing shift in RMP
of control cells during development, and the lack of this
developmental change in AS neurons, was seen uniformly across
all cell morphologies and locations.
We next examined the specific role of UBE3A loss in the RMP
phenotype. Two of the AS patient lines have a large deletion of
chromosome 15q11–q13 encompassing many genes, as is seen in
the majority of patients with AS. The third line was derived from a
patient with AS caused by a 2 bp deletion in UBE3A that results in
loss of the protein. This patient line shows a similar RMP
phenotype to the large deletion lines (Fig. 2a), suggesting that loss
of UBE3A alone is the cause of the genotypic difference in RMP
observed in our AS lines. To further explore the causative role of
UBE3A loss, CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing was used to target both
maternal and paternal UBE3A alleles in a control line to generate
an isogenic UBE3A KO line, which resulted in almost total loss of
UBE3A protein (Supplementary Fig. 3c). Similar to the AS patient
lines, neurons derived from the UBE3A KO line also showed a
more depolarized RMP throughout development compared to both
the grouped control data and the isogenic control line (Fig. 2a),
further indicating that loss of UBE3A alone is responsible for the
RMP phenotype observed in the AS patient lines.
Since KO of UBE3A results in loss of UBE3A protein
throughout the entire time course of iPSC-derived neuronal

 development, we next wanted to know whether acute loss
of UBE3A could also induce the AS phenotype. Treatment of
control neurons at 6 weeks in culture (early) for 72 h with ASOs
specific for UBE3A resulted in B60% reduction UBE3A mRNA
expression (Supplementary Fig. 3e) and UBE3A protein (Fig. 2d),
with no change in GABARB3, a gene also located in the

 observed a significant depolarization in RMP in the ASO-treated
neurons (Fig. 2c), suggesting that acute knockdown of UBE3A at
early stages of in vitro development is sufficient to produce the AS
phenotype. Similarly, knockdown of UBE3A by ASO treatment at
18 weeks in culture (late) also produced a significant depolariza-
tion in RMP in the ASO-treated neurons (Fig. 2c). There was no
difference in the knockdown of UBE3A by ASO between early
and late treated cells (Supplementary Fig. 3e). As ASOs may have
off-target effects, experiments were conducted using two different
ASOs against UBE3A, which showed similar knockdown of
UBE3A (Supplementary Fig. 3e). There was also no significant
difference between high and low dose (Supplementary Fig. 3e),
thus all ASO data were combined. ASO treatment of AS-derived
neurons, which also acts as a control for off-target effects, showed
no change in RMP (Supplementary Fig. 3d), consistent with the
lack of UBE3A in AS neurons. These data suggest that knock-
down of UBE3A alone can cause a depolarization of RMP
independent of neuron maturity.
Finally, due to neuron-specific genomic imprinting, the
paternal copy of UBE3A, though silenced, is still present in
AS-derived neurons, and therefore is an attractive therapeutic
target for restoring endogenous UBE3A to normal levels. It has
been shown that treatment of an AS model mouse with the
topoisomerase inhibitor topotecan can restore some UBE3A
expression from the paternal allele, most likely by reducing the
expression of the antisense that normally silences paternal
UBE3A23.
Treatment
of
AS-derived
neurons
with
1 mM
topotecan for 3–6 weeks resulted in B50% increase in UBE3A
mRNA expression (Supplementary Fig. 3e) and a significant shift
to a more hyperpolarized RMP (Fig. 2c). Together, these data
suggest that restoring UBE3A protein levels by unsilencing
paternal UBE3A can rescue the AS RMP phenotype.
Impaired AP firing in AS neurons. AP firing in response to
intracellular current injection was categorized as either No AP,
Immature, Single Mature or Mature Train (see example traces in
Fig. 3a). APs were characterized as mature if AP amplitude was
435 mV and full-width at half-maximal amplitude (FWHM) was
o5.5 ms. An immature AP was one that failed to meet these
criteria. A mature train was defined as having three or more
mature APs during the 500 ms depolarizing step. At 3–8 weeks in
culture, neurons from controls and AS patients showed similar
distributions (Fig. 3b). Week-by-week data for each group are
shown in Supplementary Fig. 4g. It is interesting to note that even
immediately after plating (3 weeks), 50–60% of cells from both
control and AS-derived cultures had mature firing. At later time
points, however, there were significant genotype differences.
Control neurons showed a significant developmental shift to
a larger proportion of cells expressing mature AP firing, reaching
90% of cells at 20 weeks in culture. AS-derived neurons failed to
show similar developmental maturation, resulting in a lower
proportion of cells that fired AP trains and a higher proportion of
immature APs in AS neurons (Fig. 3b). A similar lack of
maturation of AP firing was observed in the isogenic UBE3A KO
line compared to control neurons (Fig. 3b).
Similar to the RMP results, treatment of control neurons with
UBE3A ASO at early stages of in vitro development resulted in a
significantly more immature distribution of AP firing compared
to scramble-treated neurons (Fig. 3c). However, unlike our
observations with RMP, treatment of control neurons with
UBE3A ASO at late stages of in vitro development failed to cause
a shift in the AP firing distribution (Fig. 3c). AS neurons treated
with ASO showed no changes in the percent of neurons showing
mature firing (Supplementary Fig. 4h). It has previously been
shown that depolarization of iPSC-derived neurons with KCl can
result in a shift to more immature AP firing24. This led us to
wonder if the immature firing observed in AS patient neurons
and UBE3A KO neurons are secondary to the depolarized RMP
observed in these cells. To answer this question, control neurons
were grown in media supplemented with a higher concentration
of KCl (10 mM) for 20 weeks of in vitro development. Similar to
AS patient neurons and UBE3A KO neurons, KCl treatment of
control neurons (without loss of UBE3A) caused a shift to
more immature firing at late stages of in vitro development
(Fig. 3c). Interestingly, depolarization with KCl also resulted
in an intrinsic depolarization of control neurons (Fig. 2c).
Treatment of AS neurons with topotecan to restore UBE3A levels
resulted in a complete rescue of AP firing to control levels
(Fig. 3c).
To examine spontaneous AP firing in unperturbed cells, we
used calcium imaging to indirectly monitor activity. Cells were
incubated in 10 mM Fluo-4AM for 1 h at 37 �C and then imaged
at 100 Hz. three coverslips/condition/time point were used at 10,
15 and 20 weeks in vitro as an early, middle and late
developmental period. Example traces for control, AS and UBE3A
KO experiments are shown in Fig. 3d. Calcium transients were
blocked by tetrodotoxin (1 mM; data not shown). Across all three
time points, AS neurons showed significantly fewer calcium
transients during the imaging period compared with control
neurons (Fig. 3e). UBE3A KO neurons also showed significantly
fewer calcium transients than controls at the most mature time
point (Fig. 3e) but were not significantly different at the middle
time
point.
Interestingly,
UBE3A
KO
neurons
displayed
significantly more calcium transients than both AS and control
cultures at the earliest time point.
We next examined properties of individual APs. Significant
differences were observed in AP amplitude, FWHM and spike
threshold
between
AS
and
control
neurons
(Fig.
3f).
AP amplitude, threshold and FWHM all showed significant
developmental shifts for control neurons which is expected given
the maturation of AP firing observed in Fig. 3b. However, AS
neurons did not show a significant change across development for
either AP amplitude or FWHM, which might explain their more
immature AP firing observed throughout in vitro development
(Fig.
3b).
Similar
results were
obtained
when
comparing
individual patient lines and grouped lines for the full week-by-
week analysis of these features (Supplementary Fig. 4a,b). These
trends were also uniform across cell morphology (Supplementary
Fig. 4c,d) and location (Supplementary Fig. 4e,f).
Comparison

intrinsic
membrane
currents.
Whole-cell
voltage clamp recordings were used to examine intrinsic voltage-
gated conductances. Supplementary Figure 5a depicts example
inward and outward current traces from a control neuron at week
12 in vitro. Inward currents were completely blocked by the
sodium channel blocker tetrodotoxin (500 nM). Group data for
the current–voltage relationship
for inward
and sustained
outward currents is shown in Supplementary Fig. 5b. Comparison
of maximum inward and outward current densities, normalized
to cell capacitance (Supplementary Fig. 5c), revealed significant
genotype differences in inward current density as well as
sustained and transient outward current densities (Suppleme-
ntary Fig. 5d–f). Interestingly, transient outward current showed
a significant increase throughout in vitro development in
both control and AS-derived neurons (Supplementary Fig. 5f),
consistent with the developmental decrease in AP width, but
remained significantly less in AS neurons compared to controls
throughout development, which may account for the increased
FWHM and more immature firing observed in AS neurons.

 for individual patients and genotype groups is shown in
Supplementary Fig. 6a,b. These trends were also uniform when
analysed by neuronal morphology (Supplementary Fig. 6c,d) or
location (Supplementary Fig. 6e,f). Finally, we compared input
resistance of neurons from both genotypes during weeks 6 to 12
of in vitro development. No significant difference in input
resistance was observed between AS and control neurons
(control: 2.82±0.12 GO, n ¼ 166; AS: 2.52±0.11 GO, n ¼ 174).

 Capacitance of AS neurons compared to control neurons was not
significantly different (Supplementary Fig. 5c).
Spontaneous synaptic activity and synaptic plasticity. The
ability to form functional synaptic networks and express activity-
dependent synaptic plasticity is a hallmark of neuronal matura-
tion. Deficits in synaptic signalling and plasticity are seen in
animal models of AS (reviewed in ref. 2) and are thought
to underlie aspects of the AS phenotype in patients. We therefore
examined
spontaneous
excitatory
synaptic
transmission
in
neurons
derived
from
AS
patients
and
control
subjects
(see example traces in Fig. 4a). Excitatory synaptic currents
were blocked by the AMPA (a-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-
isoxazole propionic acid) receptor antagonist DNQX (10 mM;
data not shown). Control neurons showed markedly greater
developmental increases in the frequency of synaptic events
compared to neurons derived from AS patients (Fig. 4b). In
addition, as shown in Fig. 4c, the percentage of synaptically active
cells (event frequency 40.2 Hz), although not different across
genotype at early time points, was significantly higher in control
compared to AS neurons later in development, a difference that
was maintained up to 20 weeks in culture. Neurons derived from
the isogenic UBE3A KO line also showed a significantly lower
proportion of synaptically active neurons throughout develop-
ment. These differences were uniform across all cell morphologies
and locations (Supplementary Fig. 7a–d). In addition, as shown in
Fig. 4d, the event frequency in synaptically active cells was
significantly lower in AS-derived neurons compared to control
neurons throughout development. There were no significant
differences in amplitude of spontaneous synaptic events in
AS neurons compared to control neurons (Fig. 4e), but there was
a trend towards larger amplitudes in AS neurons. Overall,
the impairments in RMP, AP and synaptic development in
AS neurons could be related to cell death after prolonged time in
culture. To test this, we performed a lactase dehydrogenase
(LDH) assay on control, AS and UBE3A KO cultures at 15–20
weeks in vitro, which showed no significant differences in LDH
activity (Supplementary Fig. 7f).
Treating control neurons with UBE3A ASO at early stages of
in vitro development resulted in a significant decrease in the
frequency of synaptic events recorded 3–6 weeks later (Fig. 4f).
Acute knockdown of UBE3A at a later stage of development did
not significantly affect the frequency of synaptic activity (Fig. 4f).
Similar to AP firing, the lack of effect of late ASO treatment
suggests that the changes in synaptic activity in AS neurons and
UBE3A KO neurons may be secondary to the depolarized RMP.
In support of this, treatment of control neurons throughout
development with KCl resulted in a significant decrease in
synaptic frequency compared to vehicle-treated control neurons
(Fig. 4f). Treatment of AS neurons with UBE3A ASO had no
effect on synaptic frequency or amplitude (Supplementary
Fig. 7e). Finally, AS neurons treated for 3–6 weeks with
topotecan, which has been shown to increase UBE3A by
activating the paternal allele, resulted in a significant increase in
synaptic frequency (Fig. 4f). In all cases (early or late ASO,
topotecan, KCl) there were no observed changes in synaptic event
amplitude (Fig. 4g). We also performed an LDH assay on vehicle-
and KCl-treated cultures at 20 þ weeks in vitro to confirm that
the observed differences with KCl treatment were not due to
increases in cell death. No significant difference in LDH activity
was
observed
between
vehicle-
and
KCl-treated
cultures
(Supplementary Fig. 7f).
To test the ability of iPSC-derived neurons to undergo
activity-dependent synaptic plasticity, we used a chemically
induced long-term potentiation (LTP) protocol that stably
increases
intracellular
cAMP
levels
and
enhances
NMDA
receptor activation25. Following baseline measurements, cells
were exposed to the induction cocktail for 15 min, followed by
washout to normal bath solution. Example traces from control,
AS and UBE3A KO neurons are shown in Fig. 5a. Time courses
for the synaptic event frequency and amplitude for a control
and an AS-derived neuron are shown in Fig. 5b. Overall, there
was a significant increase in frequency of spontaneous currents
during the induction period for both control and AS-derived
neurons (Fig. 5c). A significant increase in event frequency
was still present at both 20–30 min and 50–60 min post induction
for control neurons. AS neurons, however, failed to show
significant increases in frequency at either 20–30 or 50–60 min
post induction. Neurons from the UBE3A KO line also showed
a significant increase in frequency during the induction, but failed
to maintain this increase at 50–60 min post induction, although
they did show a significant increase at 20–30 min. There was no
difference in event amplitude by time or genotype (Fig. 5d).
Plasticity was dependent on NMDA receptor activation as it was
completely blocked in the presence of the NMDA receptor
antagonist CPP (3 mM; Fig. 5c,d).
To examine whether this plasticity was also observed at the
level of AP firing, we used population calcium imaging. Example
traces from control, AS and UBE3A KO neurons at baseline,
during induction and 20–30 min and 45 þ min post induction
are shown in Fig. 5f. Interestingly, synchronous activity across
cells was sometimes observed. Control neurons showed a large
increase in the number of calcium transients during induction
that was maintained for up to 45 þ min post induction (Fig. 5e).
Although AS and UBE3A KO neurons showed significant
increases in the number of transients during induction and
20–30 min post induction, they failed to maintain this increase at
45 þ min post induction.
Discussion
AS is a genomic imprinting disorder caused by loss of function of
the maternally inherited allele of the E3 ubiquitin ligase, UBE3A.
We have previously shown that normal imprinting of UBE3A is
established during neuronal differentiation of iPSCs derived from

 AS and control subjects, and UBE3A protein expression is largely
absent in neurons derived from AS iPSCs26. In the present study,
we examined genotypic differences in in vitro development and
maturation in iPSC-derived neurons from AS patients and
unaffected controls, from the time of initial plating up to
week 20 post differentiation, considerably longer than previous
examinations of iPSC-derived neurons. Cells were also classified
by shape and by location with respect to their proximity to
cell mounds. For both genotypes, the majority of neurons were
TBR1-expressing,
presumably
glutamatergic,
neurons,
while
GAD65/67-expressing GABAergic neurons constituted the other
major cell population, and there were no differences between
AS and control cultures in the proportion of glutamatergic
neurons, GABAergic neurons or astrocytes.
Neurons from AS patients had several significant differences
compared
to
neurons
derived
from
unaffected
controls.
Specifically, AS-derived neurons displayed a more depolarized
RMP, a reduction in the proportion of cells that fired mature APs,
a reduction in excitatory synaptic activity and a deficit in activity-
dependent synaptic plasticity. These differences were seen in cells
from two AS patients with a large deletion, as well as a patient
with a mutation in UBE3A alone. Interestingly, these differences
were generally not present at the earliest stages of development,
but reflected a failure of AS-derived neurons to undergo
the developmental maturation observed in control neurons.
Notably, some aspects of maturation, for example, synaptic
activity, showed continued development up to 20 weeks in culture
reaching levels of activity greater than typically reported in other
studies of iPSC-derived neurons. This highlights the importance
of
allowing
for
prolonged
maturation
in
these
cultures.
Additionally, these genotypic differences were consistent across
different neuronal morphologies and locations, suggesting that
the phenotype is shared by multiple cell types.
Several lines of evidence support the idea that these genotypic
changes are attributed directly to loss of UBE3A. First, cells derived
from the patient with a UBE3A mutation had the same cellular
phenotype as cells derived from the large deletion patients. Second,
knocking out UBE3A in an isogenic CRISPR-Cas9 gene-edited cell
line replicated the phenotype. Third, knocking down UBE3A with
an ASO produced the same cellular phenotype. Moreover, we were
able to rescue this phenotype by unsilencing UBE3A expression
from the paternal allele with the topoisomerase inhibitor topotecan.
Interestingly, early ASO knockdown of UBE3A affected RMP, AP
firing and synaptic activity, whereas late knockdown only affected
RMP, suggesting that changes in RMP may be directly related to
UBE3A loss and AP and synaptic changes may be secondary effects.
In support of this idea, we found that control neurons, grown
under slightly depolarizing conditions to mimic AS neurons,
showed similar disruptions in AP firing and synaptic activity.
Findings from a recently published study of iPSC-derived neurons
further support this argument27. This study, which classified
iPSC-derived neurons into five categories based on electrophysiolo-
gical maturity, showed that cells with immature firing tended to
have the lowest levels of synaptic activity, although whether RMP
was also predictive was not addressed.
Several aspects of neuronal physiology showed significant
developmental maturation in culture as well as genotypic
differences between AS patients and control subjects. Resting
membrane potential, which plays an important role in regulating
neuronal excitability and the ability to fire APs, showed a
developmental shift to a more hyperpolarizing potential that
was not seen in AS-derived neurons. Although neurons from
both AS and control subjects showed similar RMP values at the
earliest time points, AS neurons remained significantly depolar-
ized compared to controls at later times. AS-derived neurons
were also different from controls with regard to the development
of mature AP firing. Similar to RMP, no significant difference in
AP firing between AS and control neurons was observed at the
earliest time points. However, the proportion of neurons that
fired mature APs or AP trains increased in control neurons at
later times and was significantly greater than AS-derived neurons.
As observed with RMP and AP firing, AS neurons and control
neurons showed similar levels of excitatory synaptic activity early
in development, as measured by the percent of synaptically active
neurons
and
frequency
of
spontaneous
synaptic
events.
As development progressed, however, AS neurons reached a
plateau in the percentage of cells that displayed spontaneous
synaptic currents. Control neurons, on the other hand, continued
to mature, reaching a significantly higher proportion of active
neurons. Similarly, the frequency of synaptic events and the
proportion of synaptically active neurons in AS and control
cultures was not different early in their development, but by
weeks 9–14, the proportion of active cells was significantly higher
in control cultures compared to AS-derived cultures. Interest-
ingly, there was also a small increase in synaptic event amplitude
in AS neurons, possibly reflecting a compensatory response.
The observed synaptic differences could be due to a number of
factors including decreased release probability, fewer synaptic
contacts or a larger proportion of silent synapses, that is, synapses
that lack AMPA receptors. Further studies will be necessary to
determine the contributions of these factors.
The connections between neurons are highly plastic, changing
their size, strength and structure in response to a variety of
stimuli28,29. Activity-dependent synaptic plasticity is known to be
important for the proper development of neural circuits and may
play a role in the pathophysiology of neurological disorders14,30,31.
In fact, disrupted synaptic plasticity is a hallmark of AS mouse
models14,32–36 and may underlie some of the cognitive impairments
in
AS
patients.
These
plasticity
deficits
include
disrupted
hippocampal LTP, impairments in experience-dependent synaptic
plasticity and impaired long-term depression (LTD). Impaired
hippocampal LTP may underlie learning deficits in AS mice35 and
other work has shown that this AS LTP phenotype may be due to
changes in calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II37 and
has been rescued with inhibition of the receptor tyrosine kinase
ErbB4 (ref. 38). Interestingly, it seems that plasticity deficits may
become
more
important
with
sensory
experience
during
development, as dark rearing AS mice prevents LTP deficits14.
Furthermore, type 5 metabotropic glutamate receptor-dependent
LTD was shown to be enhanced in an AS mouse model33 and
changes in cerebellar LTD have been associated with both loss of
maternal UBE3A and duplication of UBE3A in mouse models39,40.
Because of the relevance of these forms of plasticity to behavioural
phenotypes in AS and other neurodevelopmental disorders, one of
the critical challenges to the use of human stem cell models is
generating neurons with the capacity to undergo activity-dependent
plasticity41.
In the current study, we report the novel finding that iPSC-
derived neurons exhibit NMDA receptor-dependent synaptic
plasticity in culture. Both control and AS-derived neurons
responded to the pharmacological induction protocol with large
increases in activity, and though control neurons showed
short-term (20–30 min) and long-term (50–60 min) synaptic
plasticity expressed as an increase in the frequency of sponta-
neous
synaptic
events,
long-term
synaptic
plasticity
was
significantly impaired in neurons from AS patients and UBE3A
KO neurons compared to controls. The increase in synaptic
current frequency with no change in amplitude suggests increases
in presynaptic release probability and/or changes in synapse
number due to formation of new synapses or insertion of AMPA
receptors at silent synapses. This pharmacological LTP induction
also caused long-term increases in AP firing in control neurons,

 as monitored by intracellular calcium imaging, but did not
increase firing in AS neurons. Plasticity of AP firing has also been
shown in human stem cell-derived neurons using multielectrode
arrays42. Thus, this protocol provides a valuable model for more
detailed investigations exploring differences in synaptic plasticity
between AS and control neurons, including underlying molecular
signalling pathways. Additionally, iPSC-derived neurons may
provide insights into alterations in synaptic plasticity implicated
in the pathophysiology of other neurogenetic disorders.
Stem cell-derived neurons have been increasingly used to
identify pathophysiology in neurological disorders43–47. Previous
studies of iPSC-derived neurons found that these cells can display
repetitive AP firing, inward sodium currents 41nA and input
resistances consistent with the findings reported in this study48–51.
Reported values for resting membrane potential and frequency of
spontaneous
synaptic
currents
are
also
similar43,52–54.
The
development of active and passive membrane properties as well
as spontaneous synaptic activity has also been studied, although
typically only up to 10–13 weeks in vitro55,56. Both of these
previous studies report RMP, AP firing and levels of spontaneous
synaptic activity that are similar to those observed in our cultures at
the
corresponding
developmental
time
points.
Interestingly,
Devlin et al.56 shows no maturation of these properties over
time, as the mean RMP, distribution of AP firing and proportion of
neurons
with
spontaneous
synaptic
activity
remains
static
throughout in vitro development. The Tang et al.55 study does
show maturation of these properties from plating to 60 days post
plating, and the findings in our study best match the maturation
observed
when
astrocytes
were
included
in
their
cultures,
suggesting that our culture conditions provide an environment
that supports continued maturation of these neuronal properties
without requiring exogenous astrocytes or astrocyte-conditioned
media. In support of this, we continue to see maturation of
AP firing and half-width, transient outward currents, proportion of
synaptically active neurons and frequency of spontaneous synaptic
currents up to 20 weeks in vitro, which has not been reported in
other studies. At our latest time points, most of our control neurons
best match what Bardy et al.27 defines as Type 5 cells, in both level
of synaptic activity and type of firing. Our AS-derived cultures
seem to correspond to the more immature Type 1, Type 2 and
Type 3 cells. Similar ranges of firing maturity as well as intrinsic
currents and RMP have been observed in human embryonic stem
cell-derived cultures57. Functional maturation in the present studies
may be strongly enhanced by the presence of astrocytes intrinsic to
the culture, as well as the addition of exogenous growth and
survival factors, namely brain-derived neurotrophic factor and glial
cell line-derived neurotrophic factor.
Because AS patients as well as mice with a maternally inherited
UBE3A deletion show a seizure phenotype, changes in neuronal
and/or synaptic properties that alter excitability are of great
interest. It has been reported that neurons from AS model mice
have abnormal spine morphology13 and decreases in the
frequency
of
both
spontaneous
excitatory
and
inhibitory
postsynaptic currents9. Supporting this finding, reduction of
UBE3A expression via transfection with short hairpin RNAs that
target UBE3A reduced AMPA receptor surface expression and
decreased AMPA-mediated excitatory synaptic transmission in
transfected neurons7. Interestingly, a study using mice with
a maternally inherited deletion of UBE3A found that the RMP in
hippocampal neurons from 8-week old animals was slightly
hyperpolarized compared to controls11. Also, loss of Dube3a in
Drosophila melanogaster leads to hyperpolarization in muscle
cells58. The absence of a depolarized RMP in these models
may be due to the difference in species or age at the time of
recording. Overall, the similarities between findings in AS mouse
models and the present results in human neurons suggest that
patient-specific iPSC-derived neurons are capable of modelling
deficits specific to the AS phenotype. In support of this, similar
findings of altered excitatory synaptic transmission in a mouse
model of Rett syndrome have also been observed in iPSC-derived
neurons from Rett syndrome patients45,59.
In summary, the present study used iPSC-derived neurons
from AS patients and unaffected control subjects to examine the
maturation of neuronal and synaptic activity. In particular, our
results reveal marked differences between AS-derived and control
neurons in RMP and the development of intrinsic excitability,
maturation of AP firing and excitatory synaptic activity and
plasticity. These genotypic differences may provide a cellular
phenotype for further investigations of the specific role of UBE3A
and its downstream signalling mechanisms, and for identifying
and evaluating therapeutic strategies to ameliorate the symptoms
of AS and related neurodevelopmental pathologies.
Methods
Cell lines. iPSC lines from three AS patients (two males, one female) and four
unrelated unaffected controls (three males, one female) were generated using either
retroviral or lentiviral vectors expressing OCT4, SOX2, KLF4, MYC and LIN28
(refs 60,61). iPSC lines from two AS patients (one male and one female) harboured
a large deletion of 15q11–q13. These iPSC lines and the female unaffected control
were previously described and characterized26. The third AS line was generated
from a male patient with a 2 bp deletion in UBE3A62 by the UConn-Wesleyan Stem
Cell Core. Characterization of this iPSC line is shown in Supplementary Fig. 1a,b.
Three control lines were generated from male donor subjects and have also been
previously characterized63,64. For all cell lines, patient samples were obtained under
appropriate Institutional Review Board protocols with consent. To disrupt UBE3A
in a control iPSC line, CRISPR/Cas9 was used to KO UBE3A on both the maternal
and paternal alleles. Small guide RNAs were designed to cut the UBE3A gene at the
translational start site of protein isoform 1. As no template was provided for
homology-directed repair, the error-prone non-homologous end-joining caused
a 1 bp (G) insertion. Clones were screened by Sanger sequencing. This insertion
disrupted splicing and/or translation resulting in the loss of UBE3A mRNA and
protein. Characterization of this iPSC line is shown in Supplementary Fig. 1c.
Cell culture. iPSCs were cultured on mitomycin C-treated mouse embryonic
fibroblasts (Millipore) in conventional human embryonic stem cell medium
consisting of DMEM-F12 (Life Technologies), 20% KO serum replacer, 0.1 mM
non-essential amino acid (NEAA), 1 mM L-glutamine, 0.1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol
and 10 ng ml � 1 basic fibroblast growth factor. Cells were maintained in a humi-
dified incubator at 37 �C with 5% CO2 and manually passaged once per week with
the aid of a 28-gauge needle. Media were replaced daily. The protocol for neuronal
differentiation was identical for control and AS iPSC lines and was adapted from
Chamberlain et al.26. Briefly, iPSCs were manually detached and grown in
suspension to form embryoid-like aggregates. The following day, cell aggregates
were cultured in neural induction media (DMEM-F12, 1 � N2 Supplement,
0.1 mM NEAA, 2 mg ml � 1 heparin and 10 ng ml � 1 basic fibroblast growth factor).
DMH1 (Millipore) and SB431542 (Stemgent) were added to the media at a final
concentration of 2 mM on day 1 and day 4 of neural induction to enhance
the formation of columnar cells65. The cell aggregates were then plated onto
laminin-coated plates. Within a week, neural precursor cells were manually
dissected and grown in suspension, forming neurospheres. After 6 days, the
neurospheres were manually dissociated and plated in neural differentiation
medium (Neurobasal, 1 � B-27 Supplement, 0.1 mM NEAA, 2 mM L-glutamine
and 1 mg ml � 1 laminin) onto polyornithine/laminin-coated glass coverslips. ROCK
inhibitor Y-27,632 (10 mM; Wako) was added to the neural differentiation media
during initial plating to promote cell attachment. After 2 days, 1 mM cAMP
(Sigma), 0.2 mM L-ascorbic acid (Sigma), 20 ng ml � 1 glial cell line-derived
neurotrophic factor (Peprotech) and 20 ng ml � 1 brain-derived neurotrophic factor
(Peprotech) were added to the media. Media were replaced 2–3 times per week.
Cells were grown in the absence of antibiotics.
ASOs against UBE3A and scrambled control ASOs were provided by Ionis
Pharmaceuticals (Carlsbad, CA, USA). ASOs were synthesized as previously
described66 and were 20 bp in length, with five 20-O-methoxyethyl-modified
nucleotides at each end of the oligonucleotide, ten DNA nucleotides in the centre
and a phosphorothioate backbone. CNTL ASO, 50-CCTTCCCTGAAGGTTC
CTCC-30; ASO-1, 50-TGAGCTATCACCTATCCTTG-30; ASO-2, 50-CATTGT
GATTTGTGTCCACT-30. For treatment, coverslips of neurons were fed with fresh
media and either ASO or scrambled control was immediately added to media at a
concentration of 2.5 mM (low dose) or 10 mM (high dose) for ASO-1 or 8 mM for
ASO-2 for 72 h, after which neurons were re-fed with fresh media.
Electrophysiology experiments were carried out 3–6 weeks after the 72-h treatment.
Cell death was measured via an LDH Assay Kit (Takara) on control, AS, UBE3A
KO and vehicle- and KCl-treated control cultures. Briefly, 600 ml of culture media

 was collected 72 h after feeding and then frozen at � 20 �C. For control, AS and
UBE3A KO cultures, media were collected twice from three coverslips during week
15 in vitro and then twice again at week 20 in vitro. For vehicle- and KCl-treated
cultures, media were removed from eight vehicle-treated and eight KCl-treated
coverslips once at 20 þ weeks in vitro. Once all samples were collected, 50 ml of
each sample was transferred to a 96-well plate where 50 ml of LDH reaction
solution was added. LDH activity was measured by the intensity of red colour via a
BMG Labtech (Ortenberg, Germany) CLARIOSTAR microplate reader at 490 nm.
Plain feeding media and Triton-X-treated cultures were used as negative and
positive controls, respectively.
Electrophysiology. Whole-cell voltage and current clamp recordings were
obtained from iPSC-derived neurons from AS patients and control subjects starting
at 3 weeks post initiation of differentiation (3 days post plating). Neurons were
identified based on morphology using infrared differential interference contrast
video microscopy on an Olympus BX51W microscope. Individual coverslips were
transferred to a recording chamber fixed to the stage of the microscope fitted with
a � 40 water-immersion lens. The recording chamber was continuously
perfused at B2 ml min � 1 with oxygenated artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF)
(room temperature) containing (in mM) 125 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 1.25 NaH2PO4,
2.0 MgCl2-6H2O, 25.0 NaHCO3, 15.0 dextrose and 2.0 CaCl2. Patch pipettes with
resistances ranging from 3 to 5 MO were pulled from borosilicate glass capillaries
with a Flaming/Brown P-97 micropipette puller (Sutter Instruments, Novato,
CA, USA). Electrical recordings were made with an HEKA EPC10 amplifier
(Heka Electronic, Darmstadt, Germany) and signals were filtered at 2.9 kHz and
digitized at 46 kHz.
For current and voltage clamp recordings, pipettes were filled with an internal
solution containing (in mM) 4.0 KCl, 125.0 K-gluconate, 10.0 HEPES, 10.0
phosphocreatine, 1.0 EGTA, 0.20 CaCl2, 4.0 Na2-ATP and 0.3 Na-GTP. Input
resistance (Ri) was monitored at the beginning and the end of each experiment by
applying a 10 or 15 mV hyperpolarizing step. Neurons were rejected from analyses
if (1) series resistance (Rs) was 450 MO at the time of break-in, (2) Ri changed by
415% during the course of an experiment, or (3) Ri fell below 100 MO. On break-
in, neurons were noted for their RMP by injection with 0 current. RMP values were
corrected for the liquid junction potential calculated offline (JPcalc). AP firing was
elicited in current-clamp mode by injecting current to hold the cells at B � 70 mV,
and applying 500 ms duration current steps from � 20 to þ 40 pA in 5 pA
intervals. Inward and outward currents were elicited by voltage-clamping cells at
� 70 mV and applying 300 ms steps from � 100 to þ 40 mV in 10 mV increments.
Spontaneous excitatory synaptic activity was monitored while holding the cell at
� 70 mV in voltage-clamp mode. For synaptic plasticity experiments, neurons
were also held at � 70 mV. Following a 10 min baseline recording in the presence
of normal aCSF, aCSF supplemented with forskolin (50 mM; Tocris Bioscience),
rolipram (0.1 mM; Tocris Bioscience) and 0 Mg2 þ was perfused onto cells for
15 min, constituting the plasticity induction period25. Cells were then perfused with
normal aCSF and held for up to 60 min post induction. Offline analysis was
performed using Clampfit (Axon Instruments). Tests of statistical significance were
conducted using analysis of variance, Student’s t-test or the w2 test as noted. Data
are presented as mean±s.e.m.
Calcium imaging. For all calcium imaging experiments, Fluo-4AM (Invitrogen)
was mixed with 10 ml Powerload (Invitrogen) and vortexed for 15 s. Fluo-4AM/
Powerload mix was subsequently mixed with aCSF for a final concentration of
10 mM Fluo-4AM. Individual coverslips were removed from culture media and
incubated in 600 ml of Fluo-4AM mixture for 1 h at 37 �C. Following incubation,
coverslips were placed in a recording chamber on an Olympus BX51W microscope
and rinsed for 15 min with continuous flow of aCSF before imaging. Cells were
imaged at 470 nM (Cairn OptoLED). Areas of the coverslip with 410 healthy
looking cells with neuronal morphology were chosen for imaging. Calcium
signals were acquired using Turbo-SM software and an SM-CCD67 camera
(RedShirtImaging, Decatur, GA, USA). For spontaneous activity, images were
acquired for 6 min at 100 Hz. For plasticity experiments, images were acquired
for 90 min (see plasticity protocol above) at 10 Hz. Following data acquisition,
all experiments were randomized and coded and then analysed by a blinded
experimenter. Cells with neuronal morphologies were chosen as regions of interest
across all experiments. Traces were then blindly analysed offline in Clampfit
(Axon Instruments). For 100 Hz experiments, transients were counted if they had
rise times r15 s. For 10 Hz experiments, transients were counted if they had rise
times r120 s.
Immunocytochemistry. iPSC-derived neurons were fixed in 4% paraformalde-
hyde in PBS for 15 min. Cells were permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100, 10% goat
serum and PBS for 10 min. Cells were then blocked in 10% goat serum in PBS for
30 min, and incubated overnight at 4 �C in primary antibodies against TUJ1
(mouse monoclonal, 1:200; Covance or chicken polyclonal, 1:500; Abcam), and
either TBR1 (rabbit polyclonal, 1:1,000; Proteintech), GAD67 (mouse monoclonal,
1:1,000; Abcam), S100b (rabbit monoclonal, 1:200; Abcam), CTIP2 (rat mono-
clonal, 1:500; Abcam), SATB2 (mouse monoclonal, 1:50; Abcam), CUX1
(CDP, rabbit polyclonal, 1:50; Santa Cruz) or tyrosine hydroxylase (mouse
monoclonal, 1:200; Millipore). Cells were then incubated in darkness with
respective secondary antibodies Alexa Fluor 488 (goat anti-mouse, 1:200; Life
Technologies), and either Alexa Fluor 594 (goat anti-rabbit or goat ant-rat, 1:200;
Life Technologies) and/or Alexa Fluor 647 (goat anti-chicken; Life Technologies)
for 1 h. Nuclei were counterstained with DAPI (H-1,500; Vector Labs). Images
were captured with a Zeiss Axiovision fluorescence microscope. For quantification,
at least four fields per coverslip were randomly selected and the number of cells
that immunostained positive for specific markers were counted by individuals blind
to the experimental conditions. iPSCs from AS patient 3 and from the isogenic
UBE3A KO line were validated for pluripotency using immunocytochemistry
(Supplementary Fig. 1). The following antibodies and concentrations were used:
OCT3/4 (mouse monoclonal, 1:200; Santa Cruz), TRA-1–60 (mouse monoclonal,
1:200; Santa Cruz) and SSEA-4 (mouse monoclonal, 1:20; Developmental Studies
Hybridoma Bank). Nuclei were counterstained with DAPI.
Flow cytometry. Cells were collected, fixed in 0.1% paraformaldehyde or ice-cold
methanol, and then permeabilized. The cells were incubated overnight with
primary antibodies, followed by fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibodies for
1 h. Cell nuclei were counterstained with DAPI. Cells were analysed on BD LSR II,
using the BD FACS DIVA analysis software. A minimum of 10,000 DAPI þ cells
were collected. Cells were gated on single nucleated cells and quadrant gates were
created based on unstained cells (no antibodies added). Images of the plots used to
set the gates are shown in Supplementary Fig. 2.
Western blots and quantitative PCR. Neurons were lysed in Cell Lysis Buffer
(Cell Signaling Technology) supplemented with Protease Inhibitor Cocktail II
(Calbiochem) and total protein concentration was quantified using the BCA
Protein Assay Kit (ThermoFisher). Twenty-five micrograms of each total neuron
lysate was separated by SDS–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on a 4–20% TGX
mini-gel (Bio-Rad). Protein was transferred to PVDF membranes using the
TransBlot Turbo system (Bio-Rad). Membranes were blocked for 1 h at room
temperature in 5% non-fat milk in TBS-T (Tris-buffered saline with 0.1%
Tween-20) before incubation in primary antibody diluted in blocking buffer
overnight at 4 �C. Washes were performed in TBS-T at room temperature for
10 min each. Membranes were then incubated in secondary antibody at room
temperature for 1 h. The following antibodies were used: mouse anti-GAPDH
(Millipore, 1:2,000), mouse anti-PSD-95 (NeuroMabs, 1:1,000), mouse anti-UBE3A
(Bethyl Laboratories Inc., 1:1,000 or Becton Dickinson, 1:250), horseradish per-
oxidase -conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (ThermoFisher, 1:3,000).
Western blots were detected using Clarity Western ECL substrate (Bio-Rad) and
imaged with the ChemiDoc Touch Imaging System (Bio-Rad). Images of cropped
and uncropped Western blots with molecular weight markers are shown in
Supplementary Fig. 3f,g. Quantitative PCR for pluripotency markers and for
changes in UBE3A via ASOs or topotecan was performed as previously described47.
Briefly, total RNA was isolated using RNA-Bee (AMS Biotechnology) according to
the manufacturer’s protocol. cDNA was produced using the High Capacity cDNA
Reverse Transcription Kit (Life Technologies). Assays used were TaqMan Gene
Expression Assays (Life Technologies). Expression levels for pluripotency genes
were normalized to the housekeeping gene GAPDH. Expression levels for UBE3A
via ASOs or topotecan were normalized to scramble or vehicle levels, respectively.
