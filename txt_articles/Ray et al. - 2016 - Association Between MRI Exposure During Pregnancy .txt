IMPORTANCE Fetal safety of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) during the first trimester
of pregnancy or with gadolinium enhancement at any time of pregnancy is unknown.
OBJECTIVE To evaluate the long-term safety after exposure to MRI in the first trimester
of pregnancy or to gadolinium at any time during pregnancy.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Universal health care databases in the province
of Ontario, Canada, were used to identify all births of more than 20 weeks, from 2003-2015.
EXPOSURES Magnetic resonance imaging exposure in the first trimester of pregnancy,
or gadolinium MRI exposure at any time in pregnancy.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES For first-trimester MRI exposure, the risk of stillbirth
or neonatal death within 28 days of birth and any congenital anomaly, neoplasm, and hearing
or vision loss was evaluated from birth to age 4 years. For gadolinium-enhanced MRI in
pregnancy, connective tissue or skin disease resembling nephrogenic systemic fibrosis
(NSF-like) and a broader set of rheumatological, inflammatory, or infiltrative skin conditions
from birth were identified.
RESULTS Of 1 424 105 deliveries (48% girls; mean gestational age, 39 weeks), the overall rate
of MRI was 3.97 per 1000 pregnancies. Comparing first-trimester MRI (n = 1737) to no MRI
(n = 1 418 451), there were 19 stillbirths or deaths vs 9844 in the unexposed cohort (adjusted
relative risk [RR], 1.68; 95% CI, 0.97 to 2.90) for an adjusted risk difference of 4.7 per 1000
person-years (95% CI, −1.6 to 11.0). The risk was also not significantly higher for congenital
anomalies, neoplasm, or vision or hearing loss. Comparing gadolinium MRI (n = 397) with no
MRI (n = 1 418 451), the hazard ratio for NSF-like outcomes was not statistically significant.
The broader outcome of any rheumatological, inflammatory, or infiltrative skin condition
occurred in 123 vs 384 180 births (adjusted HR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.09 to 1.69) for an adjusted risk
difference of 45.3 per 1000 person-years (95% CI, 11.3 to 86.8). Stillbirths and neonatal
deaths occurred among 7 MRI-exposed vs 9844 unexposed pregnancies (adjusted RR, 3.70;
95% CI, 1.55 to 8.85) for an adjusted risk difference of 47.5 per 1000 pregnancies (95% CI, 9.7
to 138.2).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Exposure to MRI during the first trimester of pregnancy
compared with nonexposure was not associated with increased risk of harm to the fetus
or in early childhood. Gadolinium MRI at any time during pregnancy was associated with
an increased risk of a broad set of rheumatological, inflammatory, or infiltrative skin
conditions and for stillbirth or neonatal death. The study may not have been able to detect
rare adverse outcomes.

concern has been raised about the effects of ioniz-
ing radiation to a fetus during pregnancy.2,3 There
is general acceptance that whenever possible clinicians should
choose an imaging modality during pregnancy that has little
or no ionizing radiation, such as ultrasonography and mag-
netic resonance imaging (MRI).4
Magnetic resonance imaging during pregnancy is gener-
ally thought to be safe for the fetus, especially in the second or
thirdtrimester.5,6 Concernhasbeenexpressedaboutthesafety
ofMRIexposureinthefirsttrimester,duetotheheatingofsen-
sitive tissues by radiofrequency fields and exposure to the loud
acousticenvironment.7-10Whenindicated,MRI’sdiagnosticac-
curacy is improved with gadolinium, an intravenous contrast
medium11; however, administration of gadolinium in preg-
nancy is discouraged because of possible teratogenicity in the
first trimester during organogenesis. Additionally, gadolinium
maycrosstheplacentainthesecondorthirdtrimester,12 where
it may be excreted by the fetal kidneys into the amniotic fluid
andthenrecirculatedbythefetus.Theoretically,persistenceof
dissociated-free gadolinium could cause nephrogenic sys-
temic fibrosis (NSF) in the child.7,8,11 Although no cases of NSF
have been reported, only one case series of gadolinium-
enhanced MRI in pregnancy has been published.13
Current recommendations are to forgo use of gadolinium-
enhancedMRIatanypointduringpregnancy,unlessabsolutely
essential, and to carefully consider use of nonenhanced MRI in
thefirsttrimester.3,5,7,8Cliniciansneedmoredataaboutthelong-
term safety for the child exposed to MRI in the first trimester of
pregnancy or to gadolinium at any time during pregnancy.
Methods
Study Design
This retrospective cohort study used data sets of all Ontario
births linked to their mothers, conducted at the Institute for
Clinical Evaluative Sciences (ICES). Universal health care cov-
erage is available to all Ontario residents through the Ontario
Health Insurance Plan (OHIP). The Research Ethics Board of
the Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre granted ethics ap-
proval and waived informed consent.
Participants
Includedwereallmaternal-childpairsintheprovinceofOntario,
with delivery of a liveborn or stillborn child occurring between
April27,2003,andMarch4,2015.Formultifetalpregnancies,the
first-born child was selected. Excluded were non-Ontario resi-
dents,womenyoungerthan16yearsorolderthan50years,and
women who delivered at 20 weeks’ gestation or earlier (eTable
1intheSupplement).Morethan90%ofbirthsinOntariohavepre-
natalultrasonographybefore24weeks’gestation,14enablingac-
curate dating of most pregnancies.15 Gestational age at birth, in
completed weeks, was provided within the newborn record.
Exposures and Outcomes
Two separate study exposures were evaluated, each assigned
its own cohort. Cohort 1 comprised all women who had an MRI
in the first trimester of pregnancy, between completed gesta-
tional weeks 2 to 14, for which gestational week 2 starts 14 days
after the first day of the last menstrual period. Cohort 2 com-
prised all women who had a gadolinium-enhanced MRI be-
tween the second gestational week and up to 2 days before the
indexbirthdate,toensurethattheexposureoccurredwhilethe
fetus was in utero. Magnetic resonance imaging, with or with-
outgadoliniumcontrast,wasidentifiedusingOHIPbillingcodes,
which are assigned for every inpatient or outpatient MRI per-
formed in the province (eTable 1 in the Supplement).
For first-trimester MRI (cohort 1), 5 study outcomes diag-
nosed before age 4 years were assessed: (1) stillbirth after 20
weeks’ gestation or neonatal death before 28 days after birth
(eTable 1 in the Supplement); (2) any congenital anomaly, ex-
cluding children with a concomitant chromosomal disorder;
(3) neoplasm; (4) vision loss; and (5) hearing loss. The final date
of follow-up was March 31, 2015. To ensure that the first-
trimester MRI exposure preceded a recognized congenital
anomaly, pregnancies in which there was a diagnosis of an
anomalyplusafeecodeforanultrasound,amniocentesis,cho-
rionicvilloussampling,orgeneticsconsultationprecedingthat
MRI by at least 1 day were excluded (eTable 1 in the Supple-
ment). The Ontario Infant Hearing Program provided univer-
sal newborn hearing screening during the period of study.16
For gadolinium-enhanced MRI during pregnancy (cohort
2), a specific NSF-like outcome of a connective tissue or skin
disease was evaluated, diagnosed from birth to age 4 years
(eTable 1 in the Supplement). Given that NSF is rare, largely
found in adults with advanced kidney disease, and that it of-
ten necessitates invasive skin biopsy,17 it could be misdiag-
nosed in a very young child. Accordingly, a broader outcome
of any diagnosed rheumatological, inflammatory, or infiltra-
tive skin condition was assessed. Examples include arthritis,
vasculitis, bone disorder, dermatitis, or connective tissue cal-
cification. Any congenital anomaly, as well as stillbirth or neo-
natal death, was also evaluated, as described above.
Database Sources
All data were linked using unique encoded identifiers and ana-
lyzedatICES(seehttps://datadictionary.ices.on.ca/Applications
/DataDictionary/Default.aspx). All maternal, fetal, and new-
born infant hospitalizations and procedures were identified
Key Points
Question What is the safety of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
in the first trimester of pregnancy or that of gadolinium contrast
any time during pregnancy?
Findings In a population-based cohort study involving more than 1.4
million pregnancies, first-trimester MRI was not significantly
associated with stillbirth or neonatal death, congenital anomaly,
neoplasm, or hearing loss. Gadolinium-enhanced MRI was associated
with a higher risk of stillbirth or neonatal death and a broad set of
rheumatological, inflammatory, or infiltrative skin conditions.

using the Canadian Institute for Health Information Dis-
charge Abstract Database, including up to 25 diagnoses ac-
cording to the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Re-
vision, Canada (ICD-10-CA), coding system. The MOMBABY
Data set at ICES links the Discharge Abstract Database inpa-
tient admission records of delivering mothers and their new-
borns from 2002 onward. Mothers and their newborns are de-
terministically linked using the maternal-newborn chart
numbers recorded.
Because some conditions (eg, maternal prepregnancy hy-
pertension and diabetes mellitus) may be diagnosed in out-
patient settings, the OHIP Database was also used to identify
diagnoses starting from 90 days before the estimated date of
conception to the index birth date.14 This database contains
records of all physician billing information for outpatient and
inpatient services, including the service date and a single di-
agnosis. The specialties of the physician requesting the MRI
was obtained from the OHIP Database, as was the single diag-
nosismadeonthedatenearesttheMRI,prioritizedasthesame
day as the MRI, from 1 to 30 days after the MRI, and from 1 to
120 days before the MRI. Each diagnosis was broadly grouped
according to the ICD-9 coding system.
Child mortality was retrieved from the Registered Per-
sons Database, which contains demographic information for
all individuals eligible for OHIP.14
Statistical Analysis
Women who underwent an MRI during pregnancy were
anticipated to systematically differ from those who did not,
leading to potential confounding by indication and biased
estimates. Therefore, separate propensity scores were
derived for the probability of exposure to an MRI in the first
trimester and a gadolinium-enhanced MRI at any time during
pregnancy. Separate propensity scores were created in logis-
tic regression models containing known maternal baseline
characteristics, including maternal age (modeled continu-
ously as a linear trend); parity; year of delivery; urban resi-
dence; neighborhood income quintile; conditions diagnosed
within 90 days before the estimated conception date to the
delivery date (chronic hypertension, diabetes mellitus, obe-
sity, tobacco or substance abuse, cancer, kidney disease,
stroke, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis,
Crohn disease, ulcerative colitis, seizure disorder); undergo-
ing prenatal ultrasonography before 24 weeks’ gestation; and
the number of prenatal visits, modeled as a continuous vari-
able using a log10 transformation. Variables deemed prognos-
tically important or likely confounders were selected a priori
for the propensity score models (eTable 1 in the Supplement).
Inverse probability weighting based on the propensity score
was used to adjust for exposure group differences within
regression models.18 Standardized differences in the means
and proportions of covariates between groups were sepa-
rately calculated for the weighted and unweighted samples,
with a standardized difference of less than 0.10 indicative of
a balanced covariate.
For both cohorts, the relative risk (RR) of stillbirth or neo-
natal death before 28 days was estimated using modified
Poisson regression with a robust error variance. Generalized
estimating equations with an exchangeable correlation struc-
ture were used to account for the possibility of more than 1 de-
livery per woman. The adjusted risk difference between ex-
posure groups per 1000 pregnancies was calculated directly
within the model.
Risks of all other outcomes were evaluated from the live
birth date to a maximum age of 4 years, using marginal Cox
proportional hazard models, and were expressed as hazard ra-
tios (HRs). Censoring occurred if the child died, had an out-
come, or was alive and outcome-free at the end of 4 years. The
rate of emigration out of Ontario is less than 1%19; these per-
sons were classified as being event-free up to March 31, 2015.
Risk estimates were adjusted using inverse probability weight-
ing based on the propensity score, and gestational age at de-
livery was included as a covariate. Robust sandwich variance
estimates were used to account for correlation among preg-
nancies within the same woman. Testing of the proportional
hazards assumption was done by a Wald test for interaction
between exposure status and a function of survival time. The
adjusted risk difference between exposure groups per 1000
person-years of follow-up was calculated as the adjusted HR
minus 1, multiplied by the crude incidence rate for pregnan-
cies not exposed to MRI.
Two additional analyses were performed related to first-
trimester MRI (cohort 1). The first was limited to MRI of the
abdomen, pelvis, or spine, which are in closer proximity to the
embryo. The second was restricted to exposure at gestational
weeks 5 to 10, the main period of organogenesis. An addi-
tional analysis related to gadolinium-enhanced MRI (cohort 2)
was performed, stratified by period of exposure: the first tri-
mester (to consider the risk of congenital anomalies), and sec-
ondandthirdtrimester(toevaluatetheriskoftheNSF-likeout-
come, once amniotic fluid production occurs).
All P values were 2-sided, at a significance level of .05. All
statistical analyses were performed using SAS version 9.4 for
UNIX (SAS Institute Inc). No adjustment was made for mul-
tiple comparisons.
The minimum required sample size was 550 000 preg-
nancies, assuming a first-trimester MRI exposure rate of 1 in
1000 pregnancies, a 3% rate of congenital anomalies in the
population, and an expected HR of 2.0 comparing MRI-
exposedandMRI-unexposedpregnancies,atastatisticalpower
of 80%.
Results
Of 1 576 631 maternal-child pairs that were initially eligible,
152 526 (9.7%) were excluded (Figure 1). Among those ex-
cluded, the rate of stillbirth was higher for mothers exposed
to first-trimester MRI (2.8%) or gadolinium-enhanced MRI
(1.7%) than those not exposed (1.1%).
Of 1 424 105 delivered pregnancies included, 48% of off-
spring were girls, with a mean gestation of 39 weeks. There
were 5654 pregnancies with an MRI (3.97 per 1000 pregnan-
cies)—1737 in the first trimester (cohort 1), 397 with a
gadolinium-enhanced MRI in any trimester (cohort 2)—and

inverse probability weighting, MRI-exposed women had more
cancer, stroke, seizure disorder, prenatal visits, and deliver-
ies after 2008 compared with those with no MRI exposure in
pregnancy, with generally more pronounced differences for
gadolinium-enhanced MRI exposure (eTable 2 in the Supple-
ment). The C statistic for the propensity score model was 0.60
for cohort 1 and 0.59 for cohort 2. After inverse probability
weighting, baseline covariates were well balanced with stan-
dardized differences of less than 10% (Table 1). The rate of pre-
term birth earlier than 37 weeks was 9% among women who
had first-trimester MRI and 14% for those with a gadolinium
MRI compared with 7% in the non-MRI cohort.
The specialties of the physician requesting a first-
trimester MRI were family medicine (44%), brain sciences
(14%), and other specialties (27%), including general surgery
(5%), orthopedic surgery (6.5%), and internal medicine (5%)
(Table 1). For gadolinium-enhanced MRI, the requesting spe-
cialties were mostly family medicine or other specialties.
MRI Exposure
The rate of exposure to first-trimester MRI was 1.2 per 1000
pregnancies, and 0.3 per 1000 for gadolinium-enhanced MRI,
performed at a mean of 5.8 and 10.1 weeks, respectively. The
largest proportion of first-trimester MRIs occurred at com-
pleted gestational weeks 2 to 5 (Figure 2). Of women who had
a gadolinium MRI, 13% had at least one other nongadolinium
MRI during pregnancy. A large percentage of all MRIs were of
the head and spine (Table 1). The diagnostic categories near-
est the time at which each first-trimester MRI was performed
are shown in eTable 3 in the Supplement.
Outcomes: First-Trimester MRI
There were 19 stillbirths or neonatal deaths (10.9 per 1000) fol-
lowing first-trimester MRI (cohort 1), compared with 9844
events (6.9 per 1000) in the unexposed cohort, with a crude
RR of 1.57 (95% CI, 1.00-2.47). After adjustment using inverse
probability weighting, the adjusted RR was 1.68 (95% CI, 0.97

to 2.90) and the adjusted risk difference was 4.7 per 1000 per-
son-years (95% CI, −1.6 to 11.0). Live-born children were fol-
lowed up for a median of 3.6 years (interquartile range [IQR],
1.5-4.0 years) in the first-trimester MRI cohort (n = 1720 chil-
dren) and 4.0 years (IQR, 2.5-4.0 years) in their unexposed
counterparts(n = 1 410 913children);863 320of1 412 633(61%)
of all these children were followed up to age 4 years.
The incidence rate of a congenital anomaly was not sig-
nificantly higher in the offspring of women with a first-
trimester MRI (33.8 per 1000 person-years [165 events]) than
among unexposed women (24.0 per 1000 person-years
[109 053 events]), with an adjusted HR of 1.16 (95% CI, 0.96
to 1.40) and an adjusted risk difference of 3.8 per 1000 person-
years (95% CI, −1.0 to 9.6) (Table 2). Among women who had
a first-trimester MRI, the incidence rate of anomalies did not
significantly differ by timing of MRI exposure (Figure 3).
Anomalies of the circulatory, digestive, and musculoskeletal
system were most common (eTable 4 in the Supplement). The
risk of a neoplasm up to age 4 years did not significantly dif-
fer between groups nor did the risk of hearing or vision loss
(Table 2). The proportional hazard assumption was not met for
the analyses of vision loss or any neoplasm.
In the additional analysis restricted to first-trimester MRI
of the abdomen, pelvis, or spine, the main findings did not
change (eTable 5 in the Supplement). Upon restricting to MRI
exposure between 5 and 10 weeks’ gestation, the risk of con-
genital anomalies and hearing loss was unchanged; however,
the risk of vision loss was higher, with an adjusted HR of 2.28
(95% CI, 1.09-4.77) or adjusted risk difference of 2.7 per 1000
person-years (95% CI, 0.2-7.9) (eTable 6 in the Supplement).

of 3.70 (95% CI, 1.55-8.85) and an adjusted risk difference of
47.5 per 1000 (95% CI, 9.7-138.2) (Table 3). Live-born chil-
dren were followed up for a median of 2.4 years (IQR, 0.9-4.0
years) in the gadolinium-enhanced MRI cohort (n = 393 chil-
dren) and 3.6 years (IQR, 1.4-4.0 years) in the unexposed co-
hort (n = 1 410 913 children); 643 128 of 1 411 306 (46%) of all
these children were followed up to age 4 years.
For the rare NSF-like outcome, the incidence rate was
higher in the gadolinium MRI group (3.3 per 1000 person-
years [≤5 events]) than in the non-MRI group (1.8 per 1000 per-
son-years [8705 events]), but the CIs for the adjusted HR (1.00,
95% CI, 0.33 to 3.02) and the adjusted risk difference (0.0, 95%
CI, −2.2 to 6.7) were wide (Table 3). The broad outcome of any
rheumatological, inflammatory, or infiltrative skin condition
was higher following gadolinium MRI (125.8 per 1000 person-
years [123 events]) than no MRI (93.7 per 1000 person-years
[384 180 events]), with an adjusted HR of 1.36 (95% CI, 1.09
to 1.69) and an adjusted risk difference of 45.3 (95% CI, 11.3 to
86.8). The risk of a congenital anomaly following gadolinium-
enhanced MRI did not significantly differ from unexposed
women (Table 3).
In the additional analyses of gadolinium MRI, only first-
trimester exposure was associated with a higher risk of any
rheumatological, inflammatory, or infiltrative skin condi-
tion (adjusted HR, 1.41; 95% CI, 1.11-1.79) (eTable 7 in the
Supplement).
Discussion
Within a large population of pregnant women who received
universal health care and whose pregnancies lasted a mini-
mum of 21 gestational weeks, 1 in 250 had an MRI in preg-
nancy, including 1 in 1200 in the first trimester and 1 in 3000
with gadolinium contrast. Maternal MRI in the first trimester
was not associated with a higher risk of stillbirth or neonatal

death, congenital anomalies, neoplasm, or hearing loss. The
risk of vision loss was only seen in a subgroup analysis of MRI
exposure at 5 to 10 weeks’ gestation. Exposure to gadolinium-
enhanced MRI at any gestation was not associated with a
greaterriskofcongenitalanomalies.AlthoughtheNSF-likeout-
come was extremely rare, gadolinium-enhanced MRI was as-
sociated with an adjusted HR of 1.36 for any rheumatological,
inflammatory or infiltrative skin condition up to age 4 years,
and an adjusted RR of 3.70 for stillbirth or neonatal death, al-
beit with just 7 events in the gadolinium MRI group.
Study Strengths and Limitations
The strengths of the study include the large size and popula-
tion-based sample. The method for ascertaining MRI expo-
sure and timing in pregnancy was robust. All MRI testing in
Ontario is billed under a universal system. Among women with
a first-trimester MRI, the rate of prenatal sonography was 95%,
enabling accurate pregnancy dating in most cases. The addi-
tional analysis restricted to exposure between 5 and 10 weeks’
gestation increased the likelihood that a woman was preg-
nant at the time of the MRI and within the period of embry-
onic organogenesis.
The study also has limitations. Among those exposed to
first-trimester MRI, analyses were underpowered to assess un-
common outcomes. Combining congenital anomalies as a
single outcome has limitations, in that malformations are
highly heterogeneous with diverse causes. Although birth de-
fects were grouped largely by anatomical region, specific
anomalies might not be detected. The proportional hazard as-
sumption was not met for the outcomes of vision loss or any
neoplasm; however, the small number of outcome events
among exposed women precluded stratification of the analy-
ses for these 2 outcomes. Among the fetuses exposed to gado-
linium at any time in pregnancy, the detection of NSF was chal-
lenging because of its rarity and the possibility that it could be
missed in a very young child. For the broader outcome of any
rheumatological, inflammatory, or infiltrative skin condi-
tion, power was about 93% to detect an RR of 1.5 or higher fol-
lowing gadolinium exposure. Several models with different
outcomes were created, heightening the probability of a type
1 statistical error due to multiple comparisons. Because the lat-
ter was not accounted for and some analyses were underpow-
ered, the current findings should be considered exploratory.
Information was not available about whether a woman's
pregnancy was known at the time of MRI exposure. Because
all pregnancies ending before 21 weeks' gestation were ex-
cluded, the risk of MRI and spontaneous or induced abortion
prior to 21 weeks is unknown. Accordingly, the risk posed by
the first-trimester MRI may have been underestimated. Al-
though an MRI to assess fetal anomalies is unlikely to be com-
pleted in the first trimester of pregnancy,20 those cases for
which an anomaly was diagnosed before the index MRI were
excluded. Data were not available on the indications for MRI.
Women who underwent MRI differed in some ways from those
who did not. To minimize bias due to confounding by indica-
tion, a propensity score for having an MRI was generated
and improved the balance of important conditions, such as
maternal diabetes,21 obesity,22 and tobacco or substance use.23

Although the current study lacked data on exposure to spe-
cific teratogens in pregnancy, such as prescription medica-
tions or alcohol, the propensity score–weighted models in-
cluded maternal conditions for which potentially teratogenic
medications are commonly indicated, such as rheumatoid ar-
thritis or a seizure disorder.
Follow-up to age 4 years was 61% in cohort 1 and 46% in
cohort 2. A large proportion of children not followed up to age
4 years reached a study outcome, rather than being lost to fol-
low-up or the study period ending before reaching age 4 years.
A longer duration of follow-up may have revealed a different
pattern of outcome events. Information was not available on
the type of gadolinium agent that was administered or the
mother’s estimated creatinine clearance, both of which can in-
fluence the risk of NSF in adults.24
Other Studies

lowing universal newborn hearing screening, the respective
rates of hearing impairment or deafness at birth were 0% and
0.34%; other outcomes were not assessed. The median ges-

An uncontrolled case series described 15 pregnancies ex-
posed to 1.5-T (Tesla) MRI in the first trimester, at a mean ges-
tational age of 3.8 weeks.26 Of the 15 live born infants, there
were 2 congenital malformations (13%), probable unilateral re-
nal agenesis and an overlapping toe. One single-center study
reported on 24 Italian women who received intravenous gado-
pentetatedimeglumineinthefirsttrimesterofpregnancy,with
one congenital anomaly.13 Animal studies have shown that
gadolinium crosses the placenta.12,27
Mechanisms
ConcernsaboutpotentialfetaleffectsafterMRIstemfromheat-
ing of the tissues by radiofrequency fields. Elevation of tem-
perature in embryonic or fetal tissues can occur under con-
ventional MRI following continuous exposures over 7.5
minutes’ duration.28 The current study could not determine
the magnetic field or radiofrequency field of the MRI scan-
ner. In the era in which it was done, however, almost all sites
used a 1.5-T scanner,29 which tends to have decreased whole-
body specific absorption rates compared with 3.0-T scan-
ners. More than half of the MRIs in the study were of the
abdomen, pelvis, or spine, which would introduce more radio-
frequency energy to the fetus than MRIs of other regions. In
anatomically simulated dosimetry studies of MRI, whole-
body specific absorption rates in the fetus exceed limits by 7.5
times.30 However, most dosimetry models assume fetal and
placenta size and amniotic fluid volume equivalent to a 26 to
32weeks’gestationpregnancy,ratherthanafirst-trimesterem-
bryo. Yet, there is little evidence from animal models that MRI
is teratogenic, and any possible deleterious effect seen with
eye development in the mouse31 have yet to be demonstrated
in other animals.
Clinical Implications
Thecurrentfindingsinformpublishedrecommendationsabout
the safety of MRI in the first trimester of pregnancy.4,5,8,9 Preg-
nancy is not a contraindication to MRI, which provides highly
detailed images without the use of ionizing radiation.32 We did
not evaluate the safety of MRI after the first trimester, as some
nongadolinium MRIs are performed in the second or third tri-
mester for a fetal indication, such as a fetal anomaly33 or
tumor,34 heightening the chances of confounding by indica-
tion. Others suggest that MRI exposure in the second and third
trimester appears to be safe in terms of normal vision and hear-
ing in childhood.25,35 Following inadvertent or prior to inten-
tional MRI exposure in the first trimester, a discussion about
apotentiallyslightlyhigherriskofvisionlossinthechildshould
be balanced by an acknowledgment that it is not known to be
associated with a higher risk of other adverse outcomes. Since
tissueenergydepositiongenerallyincreaseswithfieldstrength
and, for most indications, standard 1.5-T MRI scanners gen-
erates quality diagnostic images,31 it seems prudent to avoid
more than 1.5-T MRI for pregnant women. Until further stud-
ies are done, these findings suggest that gadolinium contrast
should be avoided during pregnancy.
Conclusions
Exposure to MRI during the first trimester of pregnancy, com-
pared with nonexposure, was not associated with increased
risk of harm to the fetus or in early childhood. Gadolinium MRI
at any time during pregnancy was associated with an in-
creased risk of a broad set of rheumatological, inflammatory,
or infiltrative skin conditions and risk of stillbirth or neonatal
death. The study may not have been able to detect rare ad-
verse outcomes.
