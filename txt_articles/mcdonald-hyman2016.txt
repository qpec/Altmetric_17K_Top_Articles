Key Points
• IL-2/mAb complexes expand
Tregs and treat established
murine cGVHD, but
concurrent T-effector cell
expansion can reduce their
therapeutic index.
• Prophylactic Treg infusions
can prevent cGVHD, whereas
therapeutic efficacy requires
homing to and inhibition of the
GC reaction.
Chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) is a major complication of allogeneic
hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. In cGVHD, alloreactive T cells and germinal
center (GC) B cells often participate in GC reactions to produce pathogenic antibodies.
Although regulatory T cells (Tregs) can inhibit GC reactions, Treg numbers are reduced in
cGVHD, contributing to cGVHD pathogenesis. Here, we explored 2 means to increase
Tregs in cGVHD: interleukin-2/monoclonal antibody (IL-2/mAb) complexes and donor
Treg infusions. IL-2/mAb complexes given over 1 month were efficacious in expanding
Tregs and treating established cGVHD in a multi-organ-system disease mouse model
characterized by GC reactions, antibody deposition, and lung dysfunction. In an acute
GVHD (aGVHD) model, IL-2/mAb complexes given for only 4 days resulted in rapid
mortality, indicating IL-2/mAb complexes can drive conventional T-cell (Tcon)-mediated
injury. In contrast, Treg infusions, which uniformly suppress aGVHD, increased Treg
frequency and were effective in preventing the onset of, and treating, established cGVHD.
Efficacy was dependent upon CXCR5-sufficient Tregs homing to, and inhibiting, GC
reactions. These studies indicate that the infusion of Tregs, especially ones enriched for
GC homing, may be desirable for cGVHD therapy. Although IL-2/mAb complexes can be efficacious in cGVHD, a cautious approach
needs to be taken in settings in which aGVHD elements, and associated Tcon, are present. (Blood. 2016;128(7):1013-1017)
Introduction
Chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) is the primary cause of
long-term morbidity and mortality after allogeneic hematopoietic stem
cell transplantation.1 The germinal center (GC) reaction between
T-follicular helper cells (Tfh) and GC B cells plays a critical role in
cGVHD pathogenesis, and inhibition of this reaction significantly
reduces cGHVD in mouse models.2,3 A specialized subset of CD41
Foxp31 regulatory cells (Tregs), T-follicular regulatory cells (Tfr),
migrates to lymphoid follicles where they help quell GC reactions.4
However, Treg frequency is reduced in cGVHD patients,5 and this may
contribute to cGVHD pathogenesis.2,6 Low-dose interleukin-2 (IL-2)
therapy increases Tregs in some cGVHD patients, but does not always
reverse all symptoms, and long-term dosing is required to maintain
efficacy.7,8
IL-2 complexed with the JES6-1 clone of anti-IL-2 antibody (IL-2/
monoclonal antibody [mAb] complexes) has a longer in vivo half-life
compared with IL-2 alone.9 These complexes preferentially bind to
CD25hi cells, which results in Treg expansion in a variety of disease
models.9-11 As a result, IL-2/mAb complexes may be superior to IL-2
for Treg expansion in cGVHD. Treg infusions also increase Treg
numbers, and, unlike IL-2-based therapies, only a single dose may be
required.12,13 Prophylactic Treg infusions appear to reduce acute
GVHD (aGVHD),14 but the efficacy of therapeutic Treg infusions in
cGVHDhasnotyetbeenfullyassessed.15Inthisstudy,weanalyzedthe
therapeutic efficacy of IL-2/mAb complexes and Treg infusions for
preventing and treating cGVHD.

 B6→BALB/c (aGVHD) models, including disease severity assessments,
were used as described.16-18 For cGVHD, cyclophosphamide-treated
(120 mg/kg/d, day 23, 22), irradiated (8.3Gy, day 21) recipients received
B6 bone marrow (BM) 6 0.75 3 105 conventional T cells (Tcon) on day 0,
60.5 3 106 Tregs on day 0 or day 28. For aGVHD, irradiated (7Gy, day 21)
BALB/c recipients were given B6 BM 6 2 3 106 Tcon 6 1 3 106 Tregs on
day 0. Tcon and Tregs were purified as described.19 IL-2 (0.5 mg)/JES6-1
anti-IL-2 mAb (25 mg) complexes were injected intraperitoneally days 0-3
(aGVHD) or days 28-56 (cGVHD).
cGVHD analyses
Flow cytometry for Tfh, Tfr, and GC B cells, immunofluorescence, and
histopathology scoring were performed as described.16,20 Pulmonary func-
tion tests assessing cGVHD-associated bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome
(BOS) were performed as described.16
Results and Discussion
IL-2/mAb complexes reduce cGVHD but worsen aGVHD
Consistent with patient data,5,21 cGVHD mice have significantly
fewer Tregs and Tfr and more Tfh compared with no cGVHD (BM
only) recipients (Figure 1A-C). Daily therapeutic dosing of IL-2/
mAb complexes (days 28-56) increased Treg and Tfr levels
(Figure 1A-B), reduced Tfh (Figure 1C) and tissue pathology
scores (Figure 1D-E), and ameliorated cGVHD-associated BOS
lung dysfunction16 (Figure 1F-H). Survival range was 90% to
100% (90% IL-2/mAb complex group), and neither survival nor
weights differed among groups (not shown). These data suggest
that therapeutic injections of IL-2/mAb complexes can expand
Tregs, including Tfr, and reverse established cGVHD.
As some cGVHD patients can have aGVHD overlap syndrome,22
we next assessed the efficacy of IL-2/mAb complexes in aGVHD.
A 4-day course (days 0-3) of IL-2/mAb complexes accelerated
mortality when given alone and when given in combination with
otherwise highly effective Treg infusions (Figure 1I). IL-2/mAb
complexes also increased severity of disease, as indicated by rapid
recipient weight loss and increases in clinical GVHD scores from
days 3-7 in mice given IL-2/mAb complexes alone, and days 13-17
when given with Tregs (Figure 1J-K). This exacerbation of aGVHD
severity was due to expansion of CD25hiCD41 and CD81Tcon
(Figure 1L-M). Therefore, although IL-2/mAb complexes may
be effective in some cGVHD patients, they may not be ideal for
cGVHD patients with aGVHD overlap, as IL-2/mAb complexes may
expand CD25hi Tcon and overwhelm Treg expansion and GVHD
suppression.
Treg adoptive transfer reverses established cGVHD
Because some, but not all, cGVHD patients may respond well to
IL-2/mAb complexes, we tested Treg infusions in cGVHD. Treg
infusions were given either therapeutically (day 28), or prophylacti-
cally(day0).Asingleinfusionwithwild-type(WT)Tregsonday28or
day 0 significantly reduced cGVHD-associated BOS (Figure 2A-C)
and increased Treg frequency, including Tfr (Figure 2D). Tfh and GC
B-cell frequency, GC size, and tissue pathology scores were also
significantly reduced in mice given WT Tregs (Figure 2E-J). Survival
range was 85% to 100%, and neither survival nor weights differed
among groups (not shown).
Donor Tregs depend upon CXCR5 for therapeutic efficacy
GiventheimportanceoftheGCreactionincGVHDpathogenesis,23the
finding that both therapeutic and prophylactic Treg infusions increased
Tfr and reduced Tfh, GC B cells, and GC size suggests that Tregs may
ameliorate or prevent cGVHD through GC reaction inhibition. The
chemokine receptor CXCR5 is required for Tregs to home to GCs and
inhibitB-cellresponses.24TodeterminewhetherhomingtotheGCwas
required for therapeutic or prophylactic Treg efficacy, we compared
CXCR5 knockout (CXCR5KO) with WT Tregs. We hypothesized
that CXCR5KO Tregs may be less effective than WT. However, like
WT, CXCR5KO Tregs given prophylactically were able to prevent
cGVHD-associated lung dysfunction (Figure 2A-C), increase Tfr,
and reduce Tfh, GC B cells, GC size, and tissue pathology scores
(Figure 2D-J). In contrast, CXCR5KO Tregs given therapeutically
had no effect on lung function, Tfh, or GC B cells, and minimal effect
on GC size or tissue pathology scores (Figure 2A-C,E-J). This lack of
efficacy correlated with an absence of Tfr niche restoration, as Tfr
levels were similar to cGVHD mice (Figure 2D). These data indicate
that Tregs can suppress alloreactive T-cell responses required for
cGVHD generation prior to the establishment of GC reactions, but
once GCs are formed, Tregs must home to the GC to interrupt the
pathogenic process of producing antibody-secreting cells.
In conclusion, our data indicate that both therapeutic Treg infusions
and IL-2/mAb complexes can increase Tregs and treat established
cGVHD. The therapeutic efficacy of Treg infusions and IL-2/mAb
complexes may be driven by Treg-mediated inhibition of the GC
reaction. Future Treg-modifying therapies in cGVHD may be aug-
mented by targeting Treg homing to the GC, especially in patients
with confirmed auto- or alloantibodies.25 Importantly, whereas Treg
infusions may useful for all cGVHD patients, including those with
aGVHD overlap syndrome, IL-2/mAb complexes may need to be
used with more caution. Even though IL-2/mAbcomplexeshave the
capacity to expand Tregs in cGVHD, our data suggest that they also
have the potential to expand activated CD25hi Tcon, and thus, may
best be reserved for cGVHD patients with no aGVHD overlap.

From 
 Alternatively, lower doses or different dosing schedules of IL-2/
mAb complexes could result in less Tcon expansion, which could
increase the therapeutic index for cGVHD patients, including those
with aGVHD overlap.
Regardless, Treg infusions could prove to be advantageous
over IL-2-based therapies, because IL-2-based approaches re-
quire long-term treatment to maintain efficacy, whereas Tregs
might require more limited dosing. Considering that Tregs from a
single autologous Treg infusion have been shown to persist at
least 1 year in type 1 diabetes patients,13 it is possible that a single
Treg dose would be sufficient. However, the half-life of in-
fused Tregs in cGVHD is unknown, and long-term Treg survival
may be limited by concurrent use of immunosuppressive agents
that minimize IL-2 bioavailability. Therefore, it may be worth-
while in future studies to explore infusions of either nonenriched
or CXCR5-enriched Tregs combined with low-dose IL-2, or other
approaches that deliver IL-2 to drive Treg, but not Tcon, prolifera-
tion. Alternatively, Tregs and IL-2-based treatments could be given
sequentiallyin cGVHDpatients,includingthosewithaGVHDoverlap,
treating first with Tregs, to ensure dampening of any aGVHD-like
