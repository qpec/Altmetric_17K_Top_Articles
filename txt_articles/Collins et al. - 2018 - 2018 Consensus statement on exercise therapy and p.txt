Patellofemoral pain affects a large proportion of the 
population, from adolescents to older adults, and 
carries a substantial personal and societal burden. 
An international group of scientists and clinicians 
meets biennially at the International Patellofemoral 
Research Retreat to share research findings related 
to patellofemoral pain conditions and develop 
consensus statements using best practice methods. 
This consensus statement, from the 5th International 
Patellofemoral Research Retreat held in Australia 
in July 2017, focuses on exercise therapy and 
physical interventions (eg, orthoses, taping and 
manual therapy) for patellofemoral pain. Literature 
searches were conducted to identify new systematic 
reviews and randomised controlled trials (RCTs) 
published since the 2016 Consensus Statement. 
The methodological quality of included systematic 
reviews and RCTs was graded using AMSTAR and 
PEDro, respectively. Evidence-based statements were 
developed from included papers and presented to a 
panel of 41 patellofemoral pain experts for consensus 
discussion and voting. Recommendations from the 
expert panel support the use of exercise therapy 
(especially the combination of hip-focused and knee-
focused exercises), combined interventions and foot 
orthoses to improve pain and/or function in people 
with patellofemoral pain. The use of patellofemoral, 
knee or lumbar mobilisations in isolation, or 
electrophysical agents, is not recommended. There 
is uncertainty regarding the use of patellar taping/
bracing, acupuncture/dry needling, manual soft tissue 
techniques, blood flow restriction training and gait 
retraining in patients with patellofemoral pain. In 
2017, we launched the International Patellofemoral 
Research Network (www. 
ipfrn. 
org) to consolidate 
and grow our patellofemoral research community, 
facilitate collaboration and disseminate patellofemoral 
pain knowledge to clinicians and the general public. 
The 6th International Patellofemoral Research Retreat 
will be held in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA, in October 
2019.
InTroduCTIon
Patellofemoral pain is a common, chronic muscu-
loskeletal condition, presenting as pain around 
or behind the patella during patellofemoral joint 
loading activities (eg, squatting, stair ambula-
tion and running).1 Patellofemoral pain has an 
annual prevalence of approximately 23% of adults 
and 29% of adolescents in the general population 
and affects almost 36% of professional cyclists.2 
Patellofemoral pain tends to persist in about 50% 
of people,3–5 in some cases for up to 20 years.6 Pain 
and symptoms associated with patellofemoral pain 
limit participation in daily and occupational tasks 
and reduce levels of physical activity.5 7 Impor-
tantly, patellofemoral pain may precede the onset of 
patellofemoral osteoarthritis,8 9 which has no cure.
International Patellofemoral research retreat
Every 2 
years, scientists and clinicians who are 
active researchers in the field of patellofemoral pain 
meet at the International Patellofemoral Research 
Retreat. The aims of the Retreat are to: (1) share the 
latest patellofemoral pain research developments; 
(ii) Discuss the literature to formulate consensus 
statements to disseminate knowledge; and (3) 
develop a future research agenda for patellofemoral 
pain. The 6th International Patellofemoral Research 
Retreat will be held in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA, 
in October 2019.
In 
2017, 
the 
International 
Patellofemoral 
Research Network (iPFRN) was launched, bringing 
together past and present Retreat participants into 
a cohesive, collaborative network of patellofem-
oral pain researchers from around the world. We 
also launched the iPFRN website (www. 
ipfrn. 
org), 
a platform to share news on upcoming Retreats, 
recruit new members to the research community, 
facilitate collaboration and disseminate patellofem-
oral pain knowledge to clinicians and the general 
public.
The 5th International Patellofemoral Research 
Retreat (iPFRR17) was held on the Gold Coast, 
Australia, from 18–20 July 2017. The 51 attendees

Consensus statement
from 10 countries represented the disciplines of physiotherapy, 
athletic training, podiatry, biomechanics, imaging, biomedical 
engineering and human movement science.
There were two keynote speakers:
 
►
Professor Richard Souza (University of California, San Fran-
cisco) shared his expertise on advanced imaging methods for 
patellofemoral pain and patellofemoral osteoarthritis.
 
►
Associate Professor Thor Besier (The University of Auck-
land) spoke about how musculoskeletal modelling can be 
used to improve assessment and treatment of people with 
patellofemoral pain.
Fifty-five peer-reviewed abstracts were accepted for podium 
presentation. These were grouped into seven categories across 
nine sessions: (1) imaging; (2) epidemiology and pain; (3) 
muscle and strength; (4) biomechanics and joint health; (5) 
biomechanics and patellofemoral joint stress; (6) treatment; and 
(7) psychology and pain.
developing this consensus statement
On the final day of the Retreat, we held four structured consensus 
discussions on key topics. We synthesised current knowledge 
on patellofemoral pain from published literature, new studies 
presented at iPFRR17 and expert opinion to develop consensus 
statements on each topic. Agreement was reached by discussion 
at the meeting at the Gold Coast and by email discussion of the 
draft statement.
T
wo topics that were discussed in detail were:
1. An evidence-based framework for a pathomechanical model 
of patellofemoral pain, which was developed after discus-
sions at the 2015 meeting. This paper has been published in 
the British Journal of Sports Medicine.10
2. Exercise therapy and physical interventions for patellofem-
oral pain. This discussion updated and extended the 
2016 Patellofemoral Pain Consensus Statement from the 
4th International Patellofemoral Pain Research Retreat, 
Manchester (Part 2).11

Literature review
We repeated the search strategy we had used for the 2016 Consensus 
Statement11 to search MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL and Current 
Contents for systematic reviews and randomised controlled trials 
(RCTs) (CJB). Searches included literature from June 2015 to 
July 2017, covering the period since the 2015 meeting. Titles and 
abstracts were searched using the following patellofemoral pain 
terms: (patella OR patellofemoral) AND (pain OR syndrome OR 
dysfunction).12 To identify systematic reviews, this search was 
narrowed by combining with the keyword ‘review’. To identify 
RCTs, patellofemoral pain terms were combined with (controlled 
trial OR clinical trial). Additional searches were performed in the 
Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro). That list was provided 
to all authors of this consensus statement, and they were asked to 
suggest papers they considered were missing. This did not lead to 
any additional papers being included.
Papers were eligible for inclusion if they: (1) were the most 
current systematic reviews (including meta-analyses) or RCTs 
that had been published since the most recent systematic review; 
(w) evaluated one or more physical interventions (non-sur-
gical and non-pharmacological), with either no treatment or 
another physical intervention as the comparator; (3) evaluated 
outcome using a measure of pain (eg, pain visual analogue 
scale (VAS)), patient-reported improvement (eg, global rating 
of change) or function; (4) randomly allocated participants to 
intervention groups; and (5) were full-text papers published in 
English. T
wo reviewers (CJB, DdOS) determined the eligibility 
status for each paper identified by the search strategy.
Quality of evidence
The methodological quality of each included paper was rated by 
three independent reviewers (NJC, CJB and MvM). Systematic 
reviews were graded using the Assessment of Multiple System-
atic Reviews (AMSTAR) tool13 (CJB and MvM) (total score/11). 
PEDro was used to grade the methodological quality of RCTs 
(NJC and MvM) (total score/10). Discrepancies between raters 
were discussed at a consensus meeting, with an additional 
reviewer (KMC) resolving any disagreement.
To maintain consistency with the 2016 Consensus Statement,11 
systematic reviews and RCTs were allocated the following level 
of evidence, based on AMSTAR and PEDro scores, respectively: 
high quality ≥7; moderate quality 4–6; and low quality ≤3.
data extraction and analysis
We extracted data from each included paper. Data from 
low-quality systematic reviews was not considered in this 
evidence update. If no systematic reviews were identified for an 
intervention, we included all published RCTs related to that inter-
vention. Extracted data were used by members of the consensus 
group (NJC, MvM, MJC, MSR and KMC) to generate summary 
tables for the consensus meeting, including study methodology, 
outcomes and effect sizes. Summary tables also included infor-
mation on methodological quality. Unless defined otherwise by 
systematic reviews, we classified duration of treatment effect as 
follows: (1) short term: <6 months; (2) medium term: 6–12 
months; and (3) long term: >12 months.11
Consistent with the 2016 Consensus Statement,11 we classi-
fied included studies under the following headings: (1) exercise 
therapy (general, hip focused and knee focused); (2) combined 
interventions (two or more of the following: exercise therapy, 
foot orthoses, patellar taping, manual therapy); (3) foot orthoses; 
(4) patellar taping and bracing; and (5) other adjunctive interven-
tions (eg, manual therapy, soft tissue therapy, acupuncture, gait 
retraining and electrophysical agents). If a study investigated the 
effect of adding an adjunct modality to a combined interventions 
programme, compared with combined interventions alone, this 
was classified as other adjunctive interventions. For an interven-
tion to be considered as a new category, a systematic review on 
the specific intervention must have been identified by the search 
strategy.
expert panel voting
Of the 51 iPFRR17 attendees, 41 comprised the patellofemoral 
pain expert panel. All panel members were active researchers in 
the field of patellofemoral pain and covered disciplines of phys-
iotherapy, athletic training, podiatry, biomechanics, biomed-
ical engineering and human movement science. A proportion of 
panel members were also practitioners with experience managing 
patients with patellofemoral pain. Summary tables developed by 
the consensus group were provided to the expert panel during the 
consensus meeting. New evidence was presented alongside each 
statement from the 2015 Retreat. New statements were formu-
lated where new interventions were identified, based on the 
evidence, for the outcomes of interest (pain, function and overall 
improvement).
During the consensus meeting, the consensus group led 
discussions for each intervention regarding details of included 
papers, as well as clarification and finalisation of each statement.

Consensus statement
Following the discussion, the expert panel was instructed to 
integrate the evidence for each intervention (presented in the 
summary tables), with their expert opinion and knowledge, to 
vote on the appropriateness of new and revised statements. A 
10-point scale was used to rate each statement, where 0 was ‘not 
appropriate’ and 9 was ‘appropriate’.11 14 Pooled scores were 
calculated to represent the median appropriateness score for 
each intervention statement, with IQRs. We considered median 
scores of 0–3 to represent ‘inappropriate’, 4–6 as ‘uncertain’ and 
7–9 as ‘appropriate’.11 The consensus group made final recom-
mendations based on statements that had consistency between 
voting and associated evidence.
resuLTs
The search strategy yielded 655 papers (311 systematic reviews; 
344 RCTs). After title, abstract and full-text review, six system-
atic reviews and an additional 13 RCTs that were not in the 
systematic reviews met the inclusion criteria. No additional 
papers were identified by the consensus panel. There were no 
new systematic reviews on specific interventions outside of the 
categories from the 2016 Consensus Statement11; thus, no new 
intervention categories were added.
Quality ratings for included studies are presented in table 1 
(systematic reviews) and table 2 (RCTs). Figure 1 summarises the 
updated consensus process. We identified two low-quality system-
atic reviews15 16 and three moderate-quality RCTs17–19 on exercise 
therapy; one low-quality systematic review20 and one moder-
ate-quality RCT21 on combined interventions; one high-quality22 
and two low-quality23 24 systematic reviews and two RCTs (one 
high-quality,25 one low-quality26) on patellar taping and bracing; 
and two high-quality,27 28 three moderate-quality18 29 30 and two 
low-quality31 32 RCTs on other adjunctive interventions. No new 
systematic reviews or RCTs were identified that related to foot 
orthoses.

Consensus statement
evidence update
Ten of the 24 statements voted on by the expert panel from the 
2015 Retreat had additional evidence incorporated (table 3). For 
eight of these statements, the recommendation did not change 
despite integration of new evidence. These statements remained 
unchanged and therefore were not voted on by the expert panel 
at the 2017 Retreat.
All voting that took place was for statements regarding other 
adjunctive interventions. Outcomes are presented in figure 2. We 
identified new evidence for two statements that were presented 
at the 2015 Retreat, relating to acupuncture/dry needling and 
manual soft tissue techniques. These were voted on again in 
2017, based on the new evidence (table 3).
We also identified new RCT evidence for interventions that 
were not discussed at the 2015 Retreat. Three new statements 
relating to other adjunctive interventions were presented to the 
expert panel. Voting was conducted for recommendations on 
blood flow restriction training and gait retraining (table 3). The 
third statement referred to platelet-rich plasma; the expert panel 
felt that these injections should be excluded from this Consensus 
Statement as it is more aligned with medical/pharmacological 
interventions than physical interventions.
recommendations from the expert panel
Although the expert panel voted on four statements related to 
other adjunctive interventions (including two new statements), 
there was uncertainty associated with the level of evidence for 
these interventions (acupuncture/dry needling, manual soft tissue 
techniques, blood flow restriction training and gait retraining). 
Thus, the integration of new evidence published since the 2015 
Retreat did not alter the six key recommendations presented in 
the 2016 Consensus Statement.11
Recommendations from the expert panel on exercise therapy 
and physical interventions for patellofemoral pain are:
1. Exercise therapy is recommended to reduce pain in the short, 
medium and long terms and improve function in the medium 
and long terms.
2. Combining hip and knee exercises is recommended to reduce 
pain and improve function in the short, medium and long 
terms, and this combination should be used in preference to 
knee exercises alone.
3. Combined interventions are recommended to reduce pain 
in adults with patellofemoral pain in the short and medium 
terms. Combined interventions as a management programme 
incorporates exercise therapy as well as one of the following: 
foot orthoses, patellar taping or manual therapy.
4. Foot orthoses are recommended to reduce pain in the short 
term.
5. Patellofemoral, knee and lumbar mobilisations are not rec-
ommended in isolation.
6. Electrophysical agents are not recommended.
dIsCussIon
At the 5th International Patellofemoral Research Retreat, held in 
July 2017, we reviewed the consensus-based recommendations 
for exercise therapy and physical interventions for patellofem-
oral pain. Despite the integration of new evidence from system-
atic reviews and RCTs, and voting on two new and two revised 
statements, the six key recommendations from the expert panel 
are unchanged from the 4thth International Patellofemoral 
Research Retreat Consensus Statement.11
These recommendations will provide medical and health prac-
titioners with evidence-based guidelines for managing patients 
with patellofemoral pain. Considering the widely held view that 
patellofemoral pain is a multifactorial condition, as highlighted 
in our previous consensus statements,33–35 these recommenda-
tions are not intended to be prescriptive for all patients with 
patellofemoral pain. Rather, in line with evidence-based practice

evidence update since 2016 Consensus statement
In the 2 years since the 2015 Retreat, we identified and 
included 6 systematic reviews and 12 RCTs that had been 
published, highlighting the continued output of levels 1 and 
2 evidence for exercise therapy and physical interventions for 
patellofemoral pain. Findings of these papers were integrated 
into existing consensus statements. This new evidence was 
sufficient to update recommendations for acupuncture and 
dry needling, and manual soft tissue techniques, which were 
subsequently voted on by the expert panel. We also formulated 
new consensus statements on blood flow restriction training 
and gait retraining, on which the expert panel also voted. All 
statements that were voted on were in the category of ‘other 
adjunctive interventions’. The expert panel considered that the 
recommendation for each of these interventions was uncertain, 
based on the best available evidence and their clinical expertise. 
We recommend that practitioners use high-value interventions 
in the first instance, based on the panel’s six key recommenda-
tions, and use these adjunctive interventions where indicated 
for individual patients until high-quality evidence supports or 
refutes their use.
Acupuncture was identified as an area of uncertainty in the 
2016 Consensus Statement,11 based on findings of one moder-
ate-quality systematic review.36 A new high-quality RCT evalu-
ating dry needling to trigger points27 was identified in the 2017 
update. While the expert panel acknowledged that acupunc-
ture and trigger point dry needling have key differences in their 
clinical indication and application, it was decided to group 
them in a single recommendation on the basis that evidence 
for both was limited and uncertain. If additional RCTs are

Consensus statement
published in the future, it is anticipated that acupuncture and 
dry needling will be considered separately.
There is also uncertainty around the use of manual soft tissue 
techniques for patellofemoral pain. New studies revealed no 
significant effect on pain when myofascial techniques were added 
to hip-focused exercises (vs exercises alone),32 as well as small 
clinically non-meaningful effects on pain and function with isch-
aemic compression compared with lumbopelvic manipulation.29 
This was considered alongside evidence from the 2015 Retreat, 
which identified no improvements in pain following ischaemic 
release to peripatellar and retropatellar regions, compared with 
ischaemic release at the hip.37 The uncertainty surrounding 
manual soft tissue techniques reflects expert opinion reported in 
the mixed methods paper by Barton et al,12 where massage was 
considered to add limited value by one individual, while another 
stated it played a ‘big role’ in patellofemoral pain management.
Blood flow restriction training was added to the consensus 
discussion after identification of one high-quality RCT.28 The 
patient performs lower load strengthening exercise with a tour-
niquet placed around the proximal thigh (eg, pneumatic cuff and 
elastic wrap).28 In musculoskeletal pain conditions such as ante-
rior cruciate ligament reconstruction and knee osteoarthritis, 
this can be more tolerable than heavy load training and result 
in greater strength gains when compared with low-load training 
used in isolation.38 The RCT evaluated the effects of blood flow 
restriction in conjunction with low-load knee-focused exercise 
therapy, compared with standard high-load quadriceps strength-
ening programme.28 Although there was a significant reduction 
in pain during activities of daily living after 8 
weeks, between-
group differences were less than the minimal clinically important 
difference for pain using a VAS (20 
mm).39 There were no effects 
on worst knee pain or function at 8 
weeks and no effects on any 
outcome measure at 6 
months. On this basis, the expert panel 
considered there to be uncertainty regarding blood flow restric-
tion training for patellofemoral pain. Considering that this is a 
new approach to exercise therapy in patellofemoral pain, further 
high-quality RCTs are needed before evidence-based recommen-
dations for its use or not in patellofemoral pain can be made.
Gait retraining was also incorporated into consensus discus-
sions at the 2017 Retreat, on the basis of two new moder-
ate-quality RCTs that met the eligibility criteria.18 30 Given the 
current popularity of gait retraining for patellofemoral pain, 
this generated a large amount of discussion, including whether 
it should be considered a separate intervention category. Because 
there was no systematic review evaluating RCT evidence for 
gait retraining in patellofemoral pain, it was considered to be 
an adjunctive intervention. One systematic review was excluded 
from consideration on the basis that it did not identify any 
published RCTs at the time of their search (April 2015).40 The 
expert panel voted that there was uncertainty regarding the 
short-term effects of gait retraining on pain and function, based 
on evidence available at the time of the consensus meeting. 
Esculier et al18 reported no effects on pain and function over 
5 
months when gait retraining (personalised programme focused 
on increasing step rate, landing softer and adopting a non-rear-
foot strike pattern) combined with load management education

Consensus statement
was compared with exercise and load management education, or 
load management education alone, in runners with patellofem-
oral pain (n=69). In comparison, a small RCT of 16 runners who 
were self-reported rearfoot strikers found that 2 
weeks of gait 
retraining (focused on transitioning from rearfoot to forefoot 
strike pattern) significantly reduced patellofemoral pain immedi-
ately after retraining and at 1-month follow-up, compared with 
no intervention.30 Differences between the two studies extend 
beyond the selection of runners (eg, rearfoot strikers30 vs any 
footstrike pattern18), choice of running retraining techniques, 
choice of comparator and sample size, to approaches used to 
attain gait retraining effects (eg, motor retraining principles).41 42 
It is recommended that robust RCTs of gait retraining of runners 
(and walkers) with patellofemoral pain be conducted. These 
should focus on the specific gait variables that are associated 
with PFP
,40 43 include larger samples and evaluate participants 
over a longer follow-up period in order to establish the role of 
gait retraining in patellofemoral pain.
exercise therapy remains the intervention of choice for 
patellofemoral pain
Exercise therapy is the intervention of choice for patellofem-
oral pain, with the largest body of evidence supporting its use to 
improve pain and function in the short, medium and long terms. 
Our literature search identified two new systematic reviews15 16 
and three new RCTs17–19 on exercise therapy that were integrated 
into recommendations from the 2016 Consensus Statement.11 
These new findings strengthened the evidence that underpins our 
previous recommendations on exercise therapy for patellofem-
oral pain. Thus, it is recommended that exercise targeting the hip 
and knee is a key component of management for all patients with 
patellofemoral pain, particularly when used in combination. Our 
findings suggest that further studies evaluating the effectiveness 
of similar exercise therapy programmes may not be warranted. 
Research efforts may be better directed towards determining the 
optimal exercise dose for patellofemoral pain, especially in light 
of poor reporting of exercise prescription parameters.44 This 
will further facilitate the implementation of RCT findings into 
clinical practice and optimise the potential benefits of exercise 
therapy for patients with patellofemoral pain.
Combined interventions and foot orthoses are recommended 
to reduce pain in the short to medium terms
Based on level 1 evidence and expert opinion, the expert panel 
recommends the use of combined interventions to reduce pain 
in the short and medium terms and prefabricated foot orthoses 
to reduce pain in the short term. We defined combined inter-
ventions as a management programme incorporating exercise in 
conjunction with at least one of the following: foot orthoses, 
patellar taping or manual therapy. The majority of combined 
intervention programmes studied in RCTs involve exercise 
as one of the therapeutic components. A combined interven-
tion approach best represents typical clinical management of 
patellofemoral pain, allowing practitioners to select treatment 
components that address specific impairments identified in 
individual patients. It should be noted that there is no evidence 
supporting combined interventions beyond 12 months for adults 
with patellofemoral pain. The expert panel voted ‘uncertain’ 
regarding the long-term effects of combined interventions on 
pain in adolescents with patellofemoral pain. Taken together, 
these conclusions highlight the need to evaluate the effects of 
combined interventions in both adults and adolescents beyond 
12 months, especially considering that more than half of those 
with patellofemoral pain will continue to experience symptoms 
after 2–8 years.4 5
Prefabricated foot orthoses remain a recommendation for 
short-term relief of patellofemoral pain. There is no evidence 
supporting the use of custom-fabricated foot orthoses for 
patellofemoral pain, which are made from a three-dimensional 
representation of the patient’s foot.45 A consideration when 
using foot orthoses in the management of patellofemoral pain 
is the variability in treatment response, demonstrated by wide 
CIs.46 47 This may be optimised through selecting patients based 
on specific characteristics, such as foot posture and mobility 
characteristics or immediate improvements in functional perfor-
mance with foot orthoses.48–50 Further insight into the predictive 
ability of foot measures on foot orthoses outcomes will be gained 
from findings of an upcoming RCT.51
Joint mobilisation and electrophysical agents are not 
recommended for patellofemoral pain
The literature search did not identify any new evidence to 
change recommendations for interventions that are not effec-
tive for patellofemoral pain. The expert panel recommends 
against the use of patellofemoral, knee and lumbar mobilisa-
tion, as well as electrophysical agents, as primary interventions 
when managing patients with patellofemoral pain. It should be 
noted that patellofemoral mobilisation can be used as a compo-
nent of a combined intervention approach where appropriate, 
with evidence and expert opinion in support.12 Considering the 
shift towards active, movement-based physical interventions for 
patellofemoral pain and musculoskeletal pain more broadly, it is 
advised that these passive interventions should not be the focus 
of future RCTs.
Key areas of uncertainty
There remain key areas of uncertainty regarding exercise therapy 
and physical interventions for patellofemoral pain. We found 
no new evidence to address uncertainty surrounding selection 
of hip-focused over knee-focused exercise therapy, combined 
interventions in adolescents with patellofemoral pain, patellar 
taping and bracing and the use of other adjunctive interventions 
such as acupuncture and manual soft tissue therapy.11 The 2017 
consensus meeting also highlighted additional areas of uncer-
tainty, being the use of blood flow restriction training and gait 
retraining. It is important to reiterate that these interventions 
may still have a place in managing patellofemoral pain, but that 
further research is required.
Limitations
Despite only using levels 1 and 2 evidence in the consensus 
process, there were some limitations that should be considered 
when interpreting recommendations. First, the expert panel 
consisted of attendees at the 2017 International Patellofem-
oral Research Retreat held in Australia. Retreat attendees were 
required to be active researchers in patellofemoral pain, ensuring 
that the expert panel were familiar with published literature in the 
field and were broadly representative of all current researchers. It 
is likely that not all active researchers were in attendance, which 
should be taken into consideration when reading the recom-
mendations. Second, the consensus panel was limited to using 
published literature when updating and composing statements, 
to ensure adequate availability of study protocols and outcomes 
and maintain the rigour of the consensus process. Considering 
that the purpose of the Retreat is to share new knowledge 
regarding patellofemoral pain and its management, it is plausible

Consensus statement
that findings of studies presented at the Retreat may have influ-
enced or biased statements presented to the expert panel. We 
look forward to integrating these findings into future updates 
on exercise therapy and physical interventions for patellofem-
oral pain. Finally, it should be highlighted that studies involving 
medical and surgical interventions were not included in this 
consensus statement. While it is the opinion of the consensus 
group that exercise therapy and physical interventions should 
always be first-line management for patellofemoral pain, there is 
a need to make evidence-based recommendations for the use of 
interventions such as pharmacological agents and injectables to 
educate practitioners and the public on their use in patellofem-
oral pain. Ongoing systematic reviews in the field will help to 
facilitate this.52 53
Future directions
Based on outcomes of the consensus meeting, our consensus 
group highlights key areas of focus for future studies on exer-
cise therapy and physical interventions for patellofemoral pain. 
While we are encouraged by the continued output of levels 1 and 
2 evidence for patellofemoral pain, studies addressing the condi-
tion across various stages of the lifespan are required (eg, adoles-
cents and adults over 40 years of age). Further high-quality RCTs 
are required for a number of interventions. These should focus 
primarily on active interventions that have the capacity to induce 
long-term improvements in pain and function.
Although exercise therapy is the intervention of choice for 
patellofemoral pain, further work is needed to enhance adher-
ence to exercise programmes and understand key components of 
effective exercise prescription (eg, load, contraction type, time 
under tension and rest). This is especially important given find-
ings of a dose–response relationship between exercise frequency 
and recovery in adolescents with patellofemoral pain.54 Studies 
that explore barriers and facilitators to exercise in patients with 
patellofemoral pain, as well as exercise programmes developed 
in consultation with patients, are encouraged. We also encourage 
researchers to investigate the role of education in managing 
patellofemoral pain, as well as interventions aimed at addressing 
psychosocial impairments that have been identified in people 
with patellofemoral pain.55 56
There is a clear need for minimum reporting standards in 
patellofemoral pain publications to allow replication of interven-
tions in clinical practice.44 These are currently being developed 
by members of the iPFRN and will feature in a future publi-
cation. We are also developing consensus around factors that 
influence treatment response. The next update to the consensus 
statement on exercise therapy and physical interventions will 
be in 4 
years, at the 7th International Patellofemoral Research 
Retreat in 2021.
ConCLusIon
Recommendations from the consensus meeting on exercise 
therapy and physical interventions held at the 5th International 
Patellofemoral Research Retreat (Gold Coast, Australia, 2017), 
support the use of exercise therapy (especially the combination 
of hip-focused and knee-focused exercises), combined inter-
ventions and foot orthoses to improve pain and/or function in 
people with patellofemoral pain. The use of patellofemoral, 
knee or lumbar mobilisations in isolation, or electrophysical 
agents, is not recommended. There is uncertainty regarding 
the use of patellar taping/bracing, acupuncture/dry needling, 
manual soft tissue techniques, blood flow restriction training 
and gait retraining in patients with patellofemoral pain. The 6th 
International Patellofemoral Research Retreat will be held in 
Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA, in October 2019.
