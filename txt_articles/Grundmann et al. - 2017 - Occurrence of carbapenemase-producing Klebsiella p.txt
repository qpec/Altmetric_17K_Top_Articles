Summary  
67 
Background  
68 
Gaps in the diagnostic capacity and heterogeneity of national surveillance and reporting standards in 
69 
Europe make it difficult to contain carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae. We here report the 
70 
development of a consistent sampling framework and the results of the first structured survey on the 
71 
occurrence of carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli in European hospitals.  
72 
Methods  
73 
National Expert Laboratories (NELs) recruited hospitals with diagnostic capacities. In Winter 2013/14 these 
74 
collected the first 10 carbapenem non-susceptible clinical isolates of K. pneumoniae or E. coli and 10 
75 
susceptible same-species comparator isolates and pertinent patient and hospital information. Isolates and 
76 
data were relayed back to NELs, which made laboratory-confirmed information available for central 
77 
analysis.  
78 
Findings  
79 
In 36 countries, 455 sentinel hospitals submitted 2,703 clinical isolates. Among the 927 confirmed 
80 
carbapenemase (KPC, NDM, OXA-48-like, or VIM) producers, the ratio K. pneumoniae : E. coli was 11:1. For 
81 
every 10,000 hospital admissions 1·3 patient had positive clinical specimen. Incidence differed greatly, with 
82 
Mediterranean and Balkan countries showing the highest rates. Carbapenemase-producing K. pneumoniae 
83 
isolates showed high proportions of resistance to last-line antibiotics.    
84 
Interpretation  
85 
This initiative demonstrates an encouraging commitment, and shows that challenges in the establishment 
86 
of a continent-wide enhanced sentinel surveillance for CPE can be overcome. Strengthening infection 
87 
control efforts in hospitals is imperative for controlling spread through local and national healthcare 
88 
networks.  
89 
Funding 
90 
The European Survey on Carbapenemase-Producing Enterobacteriaeceae (EuSCAPE) was initiated and 
91 
funded by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) through a framework contract 
92 
(ECDC/2012/055) following an open call for tender (OJ/25/04/2012-PROC/2012/036).

Research in context 
95 
Evidence before this study 
96 
On April 1, 2016, we search Pubmed with the terms "carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae" or 
97 
"carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae", or "Klebsiella pneumoniae", "Escherichia coli", "Europe" and 
98 
"surveillance" for reports published between the 1st of January 2000 and the 1st of January 2016, with no 
99 
language restrictions. This search identified 72 publications. These consisted of larger national surveillance 
100 
studies, reviews or single case studies. None of the studies showed comprehensive European coverage, 
101 
standardization of methods or diagnostic quality assessment. Before this study, only anecdotal evidence 
102 
existed for several countries with high endemicity. Since national reference laboratory structures were 
103 
often lacking and diagnostic standards differed between laboratories, cases remained unconfirmed leaving 
104 
wide scope for ascertainment bias. 
105 
 
106 
Added value of this study 
107 
This study reports data on the occurrence of carbapenemase-producing and last-line resistant K. 
108 
pneumoniae and E. coli at continental scales using standardized procedures and provide the first 
109 
comparable and laboratory-confirmed data on the incidence of these difficult-to-treat bacteria across 
110 
Europe. 
111 
 
112 
Implications of all the available evidence 
113 
K. pneumoniae of nosocomial provenance is the main source of carbapenemase-producing 
114 
Enterobacteriaeceae (CPE) infection in Europe. The emergence and spread of antibiotic resistance against 
115 
last-line antibiotics increasingly erodes the ability to successfully treat patients infected with CPE especially 
116 
in countries where CPE prevalence in hospitals is high. At a time when novel and effective antibiotic 
117 
compounds have not become available, containment of CPE is bound to rely on stricter infection control 
118 
measures in hospitals.

Introduction 
127 
Carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE) are the most pervasive antibiotic resistance threat to 
128 
health services worldwide. Because of the dearth of alternative drugs, patients are often left without 
129 
effective treatment, revealing burgeoning resistance, long concealed by adaptive prescribing when doctors 
130 
could still choose carbapenems as a last-line drug. Thus, expanding of CPE could be the tipping point when 
131 
significant morbidity and mortality from antibiotic resistance comes to the fore. 1 
132 
Few alternative antibiotics (e.g. colistin, fosfomycin and tigecycline) remain,2 and while resistance can 
133 
extend even to agents still in development or recently approved,3,4 public health efforts are beginning to 
134 
emphasise containment of CPE in populations and healthcare networks. This requires an understanding of 
135 
the geographical distribution of CPE infections, their population reservoirs, and the risk factors for 
136 
acquisition. However, there is a lack of internationally comparable data. 
137 
The European Survey on CPE (EuSCAPE) was initiated with the aim of providing the first comparable and 
138 
quality-controlled data on the occurrence of the most important CPE (Klebsiella pneumoniae and  E. coli) in 
139 
Europe and neighbouring countries and to establish a framework for future enhanced sentinel surveillance. 
140 
It entailed the stepwise build-up of structures through (i) identification of national expert laboratories 
141 
(NELs)5, (ii) a joint agreement on diagnostic standards, (iii) improvement of quality-assessed diagnostic 
142 
capacity among NELs, and (iv) as a proof of feasibility, a structured survey using a standard sampling 
143 
protocol in all participating sites. The current manuscript describes the execution and final results of the 
144 
EuSCAPE structured survey. 
145 
 
 
146

Methods 
147 
Capacity building and proficiency testing 
148 
Technical staff from all national expert laboratories (NEL) was trained to use a set of standard phenotypic 
149 
and genotypic tests in accordance with EUCAST guidelines.6 Subsequently, all NELs were required to take 
150 
part in an External Quality Assessment (EQA) exercise, which was carried out and analysed by the United 
151 
Kingdom National External Quality Assessment Service (UK NEQAS). Successful completion was a 
152 
prerequisite for participation. 
153 
Structured survey 
154 
A defined number of hospitals with microbiologic diagnostic capacity were recruited by each NEL 
155 
depending on the country’s population; 20 sites for large countries (>15 million population), 10 sites for 
156 
medium-sized countries (2-15 million population) and one site for small countries (<2 million population). 
157 
To prevent geographical bias, the NELs were asked to enrol hospitals in a geo-demographical 
158 
representative manner (Figure 1, see also Step 1 in the structured survey protocol provided as 
159 
Supplementary Material). In addition, NELs were asked to collect additional information about the 
160 
participating hospitals for 2013, such as their number of beds, annual number of admissions, total number 
161 
of patient days, average bed occupancy, and average length of stay and the estimated size of their 
162 
catchment population.  
163 
The sampling period was six months, starting on November 1, 2013 and ending on April 30, 2014. During 
164 
this period, each sentinel site was required to collect the first 10 consecutive primary isolates of K. 
165 
pneumoniae or E. coli from clinical specimens from individual patients if local routine tests showed non-
166 
susceptibility to any carbapenem (imipenem, meropenem or ertapenem). All clinical specimens were 
167 
accepted, except for stool and surveillance screening samples. Each index isolate (i.e. carbapenem-non-
168 
susceptible K. pneumoniae or E. coli) was matched to the first subsequent carbapenem-susceptible isolate 
169 
of the same species irrespective of anatomical site serving as a comparator isolate.  
170 
Isolates were dispatched to the NEL accompanied by additional information such as sample date, 
171 
anatomical origin of specimen, patient age and gender, clinical relevance of the isolate (colonisation or 
172 
infection), patient location in the hospital (intensive care unit, normal ward, outpatient/accidents & 
173 
emergency), and during the preceding six months, previous hospital admission and travel outside their 
174 
country of residence. Hospital acquisition was inferred when an isolate was sampled from patients after 
175 
being admitted for more than 48 hours, or community-associated otherwise.  Instructions on the collection 
176 
of isolates, and the ascertainment of clinical and epidemiological data were given by the structured survey 
177 
protocol (Step 4 and 5, see Supplementary Material), which was translated by NEs into their respective 
178 
language and distributed to the sentinel hospital laboratories if necessary. 
179 
The NELs confirmed species and phenotypic susceptibility and used PCR tests for four carbapenemase gene 
180 
families (KPC, NDM, OXA-48-like, or VIM).  Antimicrobial susceptibility tests according to EUCAST guidelines 
181 
  
 
 
 7 
variously included, ampicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, piperacillin/tazobactam, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, 
182 
cefepime, aztreonam, imipenem, meropenem, ertapenem, ciprofloxacin, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, 
183 
gentamicin, amikacin, tobramycin, tigecycline, colistin and fosfomycin. Phenotypic confirmation of 
184 
carbapenemase production consisted of double disk synergy tests (DDSTs), combination disk tests (CDTs), 
185 
and Carba NP I or II test.7 Methodological details for any of these tests are described in the laboratory 
186 
manual in the Supplementary Material. Carbapenem non-susceptible isolates that were tested PCR-
187 
negative were classified as “Other”. Results and epidemiological information were uploaded for central 
188 
analysis using a password-protected web tool.  
189 
All data were anonymised and collected in accordance with the European Parliament and Council decisions 
190 
on the epidemiological surveillance and control of communicable disease in the European Community.8,9 
191 
Ethical approval and informed consent were thus not required. 
192 
Data analysis 
193 
Data were analysed with STATA version 13.1 (StataCorp, Texas, USA) using Mantel-Haenzel odds ratios and 
194 
Pearson chi-square test for univariate risk factor analysis and multiple logistic regression for multivariable 
195 
analysis with log likelihood ratio tests after fitting interaction terms to identify effect modification. For 
196 
hospitals that could not provide figures on the total number of patient days in 2013, we estimated this 
197 
value as the product of the number of admissions and the average length of stay. Country-aggregated 
198 
incidence estimates were reported as hospital admission incidence i.e. number of patients diagnosed with 
199 
either confirmed carbapenemase-producing K. pneumoniae or E. coli per 10,000 hospital admissions and 
200 
incidence densities as per 100,000 hospital patient-days. Confidence intervals for random errors are not 
201 
provided due to heterogeneity of sampling density as a result of different diagnostic habits.    
202 
Role of the funding source 
203 
The study was funded by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) through a specific 
204 
framework service contract (ECDC/2012/055) to the University Medical Center Groningen, 
205 
Groningen, Netherlands. The decision to submit for publication was taken by the study coordinator (HG) in 
206 
the Netherlands. ECDC provided comments on the study design, suggested national coordinators, and 
207 
provided comments on the analysis and the final report.

Results  
211 
Summary statistics and incidence estimates 
212 
Between November 1, 2013 and April 30, 2014, 455 sentinel hospitals from 36 countries contributed to the 
213 
structured survey (Figure 1). Participating countries included 27 European Union (EU) Member States, two 
214 
European Economic Area (EEA) countries and six EU enlargement countries plus Israel. For the UK, Scotland 
215 
participated on its own behalf. Albania, Finland, Israel, Latvia, The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, 
216 
Romania, Slovakia, Turkey and UK-England and Northern Ireland did not reach their quota of participating 
217 
sentinel hospitals, whilst Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, France, Hungary, Italy, Kosovo, Luxembourg, Norway, 
218 
Poland, Portugal, Serbia, Slovenia and UK-Scotland recruited more hospitals.  
219 
During the six-month period 2,301 K. pneumoniae and 402 E. coli isolates were collected (Table 1). . Most 
220 
(86·1%) index isolates submitted were K. pneumoniae (1,203 isolates vs. 194 E. coli). Proportions of index 
221 
and comparator isolates did not differ in terms of anatomical origin or specimen type except for blood 
222 
stream infections caused by E. coli, where carbapenem-susceptible isolates contributed significantly more 
223 
infections (Supplementary Table 1).  It therefore seems that the ability to cause infections is not contingent 
224 
on the resistance traits under study. Of all isolates submitted by the NELs as carbapenem non-susceptible, 
225 
PCR tests confirmed the presence of KPC, NDM, OXA-48-like, and VIM type genes for 850 (70·7%) of K. 
226 
pneumoniae and 77 (39·7%) of E. coli. Among the 927 carbapenemase-producers, the ratio between K. 
227 
pneumoniae and E. coli was 11:1. 
228 
Country-aggregated incidence differed greatly between countries. Based on population-weighted averages, 
229 
1.3 patients per 10,000 hospital admissions and 2.5 patients per 100,000 hospital patient-days were 
230 
identified with a carbapenemase-producing K. pneumoniae or E. coli. High incidence countries included 
231 
Greece, Italy, Montenegro, Spain, and Serbia.  
232 
Distribution of KPC, NDM, OXA-48, and VIM carbapenemases  
233 
KPC enzymes detected in 393 isolates of all 927 CPE isolates (42·4%) represented the most frequent 
234 
carbapenemases. OXA-48-like enzymes were the second most frequent (353 isolates, 38·1%) and were the 
235 
most prominent class of carbapenemases in eight countries. NDM genes were detected in 113 (12·2%) and 
236 
VIM in 68 K. pneumoniae isolates (7.3%).  
237 
Likewise, among K. pneumoniae, the most frequently detected carbapenemases were KPC enzymes (379 
238 
isolates, 44·6%), followed by OXA-48-like (310 isolates, 36·5%), NDM (93 isolates, 10·9%) and VIM (68 
239 
isolates, 8·0%). In E. coli the most frequently detected carbapenemases were OXA-48-like enzymes (43 
240 
isolates, 55·8%) followed by NDM (20 isolates, 26·0%) and KPC (14 isolates, 18·2%), albeit with substantial 
241 
country-to country variation in relative prevalence (Table 2a and 2b).  
242 
At country level, high proportions of KPC-positive K. pneumoniae among carbapenem-non-susceptible 
243 
isolates were found in Italy (187 isolates, 95·9%), Israel (31 isolates, 79·5%), Greece (56 isolates, 65·1 %) 
244 
  
 
 
 9 
and Portugal (36 isolates, 59·0%).  These four countries, plus Cyprus, were the only countries where KPC 
245 
genes were also detected in E. coli, albeit in very small numbers. OXA-48-like enzymes, were frequent in 
246 
Turkey where 98 of 124 carbapenem-non-susceptible K. pneumoniae (79·0%) and 19 of 22 E. coli (86·4%) 
247 
had these enzymes, followed by Romania, where 50 of 68 (73·5%) carbapenem-non-susceptible K. 
248 
pneumoniae had OXA-48-like enzymes. These enzymes were also frequent in Spain (81 of 116, 69·8%), 
249 
Belgium (18 of 48, 37·5%), France (10 of 27, 37·0%) and Germany (12 of 36, 33·3%).  
250 
NDM was the most frequent carbapenemase in Serbia (33 of 67 isolates, 49·3 %) and in Montenegro, where 
251 
all ten submitted carbapenem non-susceptible K. pneumoniae isolates were NDM-positive. In Greece, NDM 
252 
was the second most frequent carbapenemase in K. pneumoniae (12 of 86, 13·9%). Other countries with 
253 
notable proportions of NDM-producing K. pneumoniae were Romania (5 of 68, 7·4%) and Turkey (9 of 124, 
254 
7·3%). NDM-producing K. pneumoniae were also isolated in another 12 European countries but in small 
255 
numbers ranging between one and three isolates, though they also made up the majority of 
256 
carbapenemase-producing K. pneumoniae isolates in Bulgaria and Denmark. In the case of E. coli, small but 
257 
significant numbers of NDM-producing isolates were found in Bulgaria (8 of 8, 100%) and Serbia (5 of 5, 
258 
100%). Single isolates of NDM-producing E. coli were identified in another seven countries. 
259 
VIM carbapenemases only found in K. pneumoniae, were the least frequent but represented the majority of 
260 
carbapenemase-producing isolates in Hungary (26 of 36, 72·2%) and Croatia (5 of 48, 10·4%). Otherwise, 
261 
only Greece (9 of 86, 10·5%) and Spain (12, 10·3%) had notable numbers of VIM-producing K. pneumoniae, 
262 
whilst these were also found in another seven countries, albeit in low numbers. 
263 
Phenotypic drug resistance 
264 
Twelve (33·3%) of the NELs tested the full panel of 18 recommended antibiotics. Some NELs found it 
265 
difficult to obtain particular compounds, whereas others used their routine reference service panel and 
266 
Denmark did not report any antibiotic susceptibility test results. Last-line antibiotics included colistin, 
267 
tigecycline and fosfomycin and were tested by 22, 20 and 18 NELs, respectively.  
268 
For K. pneumoniae, the proportion of isolates that were reported resistant to all antibiotics varied between 
269 
zero and 28·6% (average 9·3%, Table 3). Resistance to colistin was reported for 183 of 646 (28·3%) K. 
270 
pneumoniae isolates, fosfomycin resistance in 270 of 500 isolates (54·0%) and tigecycline resistance 
271 
(according to its current EUCAST recommended breakpoint) in only 29 of 555 (5·2%). High proportions of K. 
272 
pneumoniae resistant to last-line antibiotics were found in Italy, Romania, Turkey and Spain (Table 3). Of 
273 
the 77 E. coli confirmed to have carbapenemases, 57 were tested for susceptibility to colistin with three 
274 
being resistant, 43 to fosfomycin (two isolates resistant) and 48 to tigecycline (1 isolate resistant). 
275 
Risk factors 
276 
Carbapenem-susceptible comparator isolates of the same species were collected irrespective of anatomical 
277 
site from clinical material submitted for diagnostic purposes from successive patients. These provided an 
278 
  
 
 
 10 
important and unbiased sample, representative of the local susceptible population and served as an 
279 
appropriate ‘control’ group. Univariate analysis identified six risk factors that were positively associated 
280 
with carbapenemase-producing K. pneumoniae or E. coli, and two factors that were negatively associated 
281 
(Supplementary Table 2). Four of these remained significantly and independently associated with 
282 
carbapenemase-producing K. pneumoniae or E. coli in the multivariable model which included intensive 
283 
care therapy (OR=1·9, 95% CI, 1·4 – 2·7), hospital admission in the preceding six months (OR=2·0, 1·5 – 2·7), 
284 
hospital-acquisition (OR=2·6, 1·9 – 3·7) and travel outside the country of residence in the previous six 
285 
months  (OR=3·0, 1·6 – 5·7). 
286

Discussion 
288 
Clinicians increasingly depend on carbapenem antibiotics for the treatment of infections due to otherwise 
289 
multidrug-resistant bacteria. CPE have been implicated in hospital outbreaks and have the propensity to 
290 
spread (or disseminate their plasmids) rapidly at local, regional and international levels.10-15 
291 
We provide comprehensive survey results on the occurrence of carbapenemase-producing K. pneumoniae 
292 
and E. coli between November 2013 and April 2014 from 455 hospitals in 34 countries plus Turkey and 
293 
Israel, altogether serving an estimated catchment of over 270 million citizens out of a total population of 
294 
600 million. During the course of this investigation, NELs successfully expanded their capacity and adjusted 
295 
workflows to accommodate new diagnostic tests.16  
296 
However, as with all sampling frameworks for bacteria and epidemiological data, important caveats remain. 
297 
Despite decisions to minimise workload by concentrating on the two clinically most relevant species and 
298 
reducing the amount of additional information, nine countries failed to recruit their quota of sentinel sites 
299 
and an another eight countries did not provide crucial denominator data. In some cases this was because of 
300 
financial constraints and because the workload could not be accommodated by some of the hospital 
301 
laboratories that had initially agreed to participate. Some NELs with established routines could not manage 
302 
to test additional antibiotics. As with other international surveillance systems (EARS-Net) this study relied 
303 
on routinely available data.  For these reasons, the precision of some of the estimates on the occurrence 
304 
and risk factors of CPE in the European region could still be improved. For example, some countries 
305 
reported very low numbers of index CPE isolates whereas, judging from existing publications and high 
306 
endemicity in neighbouring countries, much higher rates would have been expected. It is possible that in 
307 
these countries diagnostic habits result in a lower sampling density or that the recruited sentinel sites were 
308 
less able to reliably identify carbapenem-non-susceptible isolates despite testing proficiency of the NELs, 
309 
concealing the true incidence of CPE through these types of ascertainment bias. Moreover, 353 (29·3%) of 
310 
the K. pneumoniae isolates and 117 (60·3%) of the E. coli isolates that were submitted by the sentinel 
311 
hospital laboratories as suspected carbapenem-non-susceptible had none of the four major 
312 
carbapenemases (KPC, NDM, OXA-48-like and VIM) and were reported as “Other”. This lack in specificity 
313 
could be the result of a carbapenemase not included in the test panel, or alternative mechanisms such as 
314 
reduced permeability. At the same time, sentinel laboratories relied on their local routine antibiotic 
315 
susceptibility tests which may also be the source of potential misclassification. Nevertheless, these first 
316 
data on CPE generated in a comprehensive manner will serve as a benchmark against which future 
317 
initiatives and trends will be measured.  
318 
Hospital incidence of carbapenemase-producing K. pneumoniae and E. coli per 10,000 admissions ranged 
319 
from six in Italy to 0·02 in Norway with an average of 1·3. The incidence density per 100,000 hospital 
320 
patient-days ranged from 17·3 in Greece to 0·09 in Lithuania, an average of 2·5 across all countries. These 
321 
values will underestimate total CPE incidence, because carbapenemases also occur in other 
322 
  
 
 
 12 
Enterobacteriaceae, though less frequently than in Klebsiella spp.17 Moreover, the lack of denominator data 
323 
from eight countries cautions against our ranking of incidence rates. Proportions of carbapenemase-
324 
positive bacteria considered in this study varied between countries and between the two species under 
325 
investigation (Table 2a and Table 2b). This may be the result of the differential success of certain clonal 
326 
lineages in different countries.10,14 Importantly, we found a clear association with healthcare as most 
327 
isolates were either hospital-acquired, often associated with intensive care treatment, or isolated from 
328 
patients with previous hospital admission. We also found an association with previous travel outside the 
329 
country of residence (Supplementary Table 2). But when interpreting this finding one need to consider that 
330 
many of the highly endemic countries could not provide information on previous travel, which may have 
331 
led to an inflation of the risk estimate. 
332 
The highest incidence for carbapenemase-producing K. pneumoniae and E. coli were reported from 
333 
southern and south-eastern Europe. In Greece, VIM-positive K. pneumoniae started to expand in the mid-
334 
2000s,18 but that changed with the rapid spread of KPC-producing K. pneumoniae from around 2007 which 
335 
subsequently became the dominant CPE.10 The present observation that NDM is now the second-ranking 
336 
carbapenemase in Greece is striking and raises the concern that there may be a further replacement event 
337 
by this more recently expanding carbapenemase.19 
338 
There were fewer carbapenemase-producing isolates among E. coli than K. pneumoniae. KPC enzymes were 
339 
especially rare in E. coli and were only identified in countries with high levels of KPC-producing K. 
340 
pneumoniae, where they probably reflect a spill-over of resistance genes from the K. pneumoniae reservoir. 
341 
Significant numbers of E. coli with OXA-48-like were found in Belgium, France, Spain, Turkey, and UK and 
342 
NDM carbapenemases in Bulgaria and Serbia. Penetration into E. coli is of concern, because E. coli spreads 
343 
in the community more readily than K. pneumoniae, meaning that infection control interventions that 
344 
mainly focus on hospitals are less likely to be effective. Moreover, E. coli from the digestive tract are 
345 
common vectors for promiscuous plasmids, which could also accelerate epidemic expansion. 
346 
In Romania, eight of 12 participating hospitals submitted K. pneumoniae isolates with OXA-48-like enzymes 
347 
and the majority were genetically indistinguishable by DNA fingerprinting, indicating countrywide spread of 
348 
a single clone.20 This may be analogous to the national expansion of K. pneumoniae ST258-related clones 
349 
with KPC-2 or -3 enzymes in e.g. Greece, Italy and Israel, though with a different clonal lineage and 
350 
carbapenemase type. OXA-48-like carbapenemases were frequent in Malta, Spain, France and Belgium, 
351 
where they appear to be repeatedly introduced from Northern Africa. Genes coding for NDM seem to also 
352 
be spreading in the Balkan region, with significant numbers in Montenegro, Serbia and Greece but also 
353 
extending north into Slovenia and Austria. Surprisingly, no NDM-producing isolates were reported from 
354 
Albania, Kosovo and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, despite their occurrence in adjacent 
355 
countries and reports from patients transferred from these countries to other European countries.21 
356 
  
 
 
 13 
Only 12 countries tested the complete panel of antibiotics recommended by the study protocol. This makes 
357 
it difficult to determine the extent with which extensively drug-resistant (XDR) or pandrug-resistant (PDR) 
358 
Enterobacteriaceae phenotypes prevail in European hospitals.22 Clinically more important than these 
359 
epithets are, however, the proportions of carbapenemase-producing isolates that are also resistant to last-
360 
line antibiotics such as colistin, fosfomycin and tigecycline. We generally observed that high-CPE-incidence 
361 
countries saw more resistance also to these last-line antibiotics, perhaps reflecting greater use and 
362 
selection pressure. However, there were exceptions. Germany, which has a moderate CPE incidence, 
363 
reported much higher rates of colistin and fosfomycin resistance than other moderate incidence countries.  
364 
More worrying is the fact that the overall proportions of fosfomycin resistance (54%) and colistin resistance 
365 
(28·3%) have become so high among carbapenemase-producing K. pneumoniae that even the ‘colistin-plus’ 
366 
treatment regimens favoured for infections due to CPE are increasingly jeopardized, leaving ever so little 
367 
choice in many cases.23,24    
368 
Conclusions 
369 
As exemplified with this structured survey, the EuSCAPE project documented an encouraging degree of 
370 
commitment from NELs, and shows that the political and logistical challenges of establishing a framework 
371 
of enhanced sentinel surveillance for CPE can be overcome in Europe, Turkey and Israel. There were large 
372 
variations across Europe with respect to the distribution of the four major types of carbapenemases among 
373 
clinical isolates of K. pneumoniae and E. coli. Clinicians should pay attention to antibiotic susceptibility 
374 
testing results and be alerted when isolates show any degree of carbapenem non-susceptibility, which 
375 
would require confirmation of carbapenemase production. For the majority of isolates, there were still 
376 
alternative options for patient treatment; however, resistance to all tested antibiotics was also reported, 
377 
which is another reminder of the urgent need for prevention and control of CPE in Europe and emphasizes 
378 
the need for novel antibacterial agents that are active against carbapenem-resistant bacteria.
