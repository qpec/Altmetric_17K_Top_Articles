Genetic biomarkers for the risk of seizures
in long QT syndrome
ABSTRACT
Objectives: The coprevalence, severity, and biomarkers for seizures and arrhythmias in long QT
syndrome (LQTS) remain incompletely understood.
Methods: Using the Rochester-based LQTS Registry, this study included large cohorts of
LQTS1–3 participants (LQTS1, n 5 965) and those without a LQTS mutation (LQTS2, n 5 936).
Results: Compared to LQTS2 participants, there was a higher prevalence of LQTS1, LQTS2, and
LQTS1 participants classified as having seizures (p , 0.001, i.e., history of seizures/epilepsy or
antiseizure medication). LQTS1 participants with longer corrected QT interval (QTc) durations
were more likely to have seizures. LQTS2 mutations in the KCNH2 pore domain were positive
predictors for both arrhythmias and seizures. In contrast, mutations in the cyclic nucleotide
binding domain (cNBD) of KCNH2 conferred a negative risk of seizures, but not arrhythmias.
LQTS2, KCNH2-pore, KCNH2-cNBD, QTc duration, and sex were independent predictors of
seizures. LQTS1 participants with seizures had significantly longer QTc durations, and a history
of seizures was the strongest independent predictor of arrhythmias (hazard ratio 4.09, 95%
confidence interval 2.63–6.36, p , 0.001).
Conclusions: This study highlights potential biomarkers for neurocardiac electrical abnormalities
in LQTS. Neurology® 2016;87:1660–1668
GLOSSARY
aa 5 amino acid; ACA 5 aborted cardiac arrest; ANS 5 autonomic nervous system; CI 5 confidence interval; cNBD 5 cyclic

Patients with genetic ion channel diseases develop electrical disturbances in the brain (seizures)
and heart (arrhythmias) that can lead to sudden death.1–5 Congenital long QT syndrome
(LQTS) is a classically studied genetic cardiac disease affecting 1:2,000 people.6 LQTS muta-
tions disrupt the cardiac activation-recovery process, due to sustained depolarizing current (e.g.,
LQTS3) or reduced repolarizing current (e.g., LQTS1 and LQTS2). Type of LQTS, age, sex,
corrected QT interval (QTc) duration, mutation region, autonomic nervous system (ANS) tone,
and channel expression and biophysical properties are risk factors for arrhythmias and sudden
cardiac death (SCD).7–10 A subpopulation of LQTS1 patients also develop seizures.1,3 One
possible link for neurocardiac electrical disturbances is that the genes mutated in LQTS1–3
are expressed in the heart and brain.11–13
Young adults with epilepsy have a 24-fold higher risk of sudden death.14 Potential mecha-
nisms for sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) include cardiac arrhythmias, respira-
tory dysfunction, cerebral hypoperfusion, and other ANS perturbations.2 In a cohort of SUDEP
patients, genetic analysis identified many genes responsible for cardiac arrhythmias.15
The Rochester-based LQTS Registry was used to assess LQTS mutations and their relation-
ship to neurocardiac disease manifestations and the risk of SCD/SUDEP. We hypothesized that
participants with LQTS mutations have an increased seizure susceptibility, and LQTS1 partic-
ipants with seizures are at an increased risk of cardiac arrhythmias and SCD. The results

 demonstrate that seizures are an additional
LQTS comorbidity. Seizures were the stron-
gest independent risk factor for lethal cardiac
arrhythmias in LQTS.
METHODS Rochester-based LQTS Registry. The Rochester-
based LQTS Registry included detailed clinical and genetic
information from 1,901 genotyped consented participants
(61% women) with follow-up (birth to 40 years old or June
2014, no ethnic or sex restrictions). Analyses were limited to
participants genotype positive for a single KCNQ1 (LQTS1),
KCNH2 (LQTS2), or SCN5A (LQTS3) mutation (LQTS1,
n 5 965), or their family members without a LQTS mutation
(LQTS2, n 5 936). Thus, only one known LQTS mutation was
present in each family. The groups were based on genotype, and
subanalyses included subdividing the groups based on QTc
duration (see the definitions section below) or adjusting for
QTc duration in the multivariate analysis.
Outcome measures included seizures, QTc duration, and car-
diac arrhythmias. Analyses were performed to assess the preva-
lence of seizures based on LQTS1 vs LQTS2, LQTS mutant
gene, region of LQTS gene mutation, QTc duration, sex, and
age. Differences in the cardiac manifestations were compared in
those with vs without seizures.
Definitions. Similar to the inclusion criteria used previously by
others,1 participants were classified as having seizures if patient or
physician documents noted either a personal history of seizures/
epilepsy or antiseizure medication. Baseline QTc duration was
classified as follows: normal QTc (male ,430 milliseconds
[ms], female ,450 ms), borderline QTc prolongation (male
430–449 ms, female 450–469 ms), and QTc prolongation (male
$450 ms, female $470 ms). Cardiac arrhythmias were defined as
ventricular tachycardia, torsades de pointes, ventricular fibrilla-
tion, or aborted cardiac arrest (ACA), which were gathered from
yearly follow-up reports.
LQTS gene topology. KCNQ1 (LQTS1) and KCNH2 (LQTS2)
missense mutations were classified by the region of the mutation
on the protein topology.7,10 Specifically, KCNH2 amino acid (aa)
mutations were divided into N-terminus (#403 aa), transmem-
brane (404–547 aa), pore (548–659 aa), cyclic nucleotide bind-
ing domain (cNBD, 750–870 aa), and C-terminus ($660 aa,
excluding cNBD).
Study approval. The LQTS Registry was approved by the
University
of
Rochester
Research
Subject
Review
Board
(RSRB00025305). All data were handled in accordance with
applicable laws. HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and
Accountability Act) requirements for accounting of disclosure,
consent, and withdrawal of consent were followed. Written
informed consent was obtained from all participants or guardians
in the study.
Statistics. Comparisons were tested for statistical significance
using the x2 test. The Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test was
applied to assess the correlation between QTc vs seizures or
cardiac arrhythmias. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards
regression analysis was used to identify the independent
predictors of seizures and cardiac arrhythmias,7,10 adjusting for
LQTS genotype, region of the mutation, QTc per 100 ms, sex
(age ,15 and 15–40 years), time-dependent b-blocker usage,
and history of seizures, and stratified by decade of birth. The
t test with Welch correction and analysis of variance with the
Tukey post hoc test were used to test for differences in QTc
among groups.10 Significance was defined as p , 0.05, and all
statistical tests were 2-sided. Where the difference was highly
significant, p , 0.001 was listed.
RESULTS LQTS1, type of LQTS, QTc prolongation,
and female sex were positive risk factors for seizures.
Baseline characteristics, listed in table 1, indicated
that compared to LQTS2 participants, LQTS1 par-
ticipants were significantly younger, with longer R-R
and QTc intervals, and a higher percentage of them
received antiarrhythmic therapy. Despite different
mutant genes in LQTS1–3, other than antiarrhyth-
mic therapy, the baseline characteristics were similar.
Based on these inclusion criteria, 182 of 1,901 par-
ticipants had seizures (figure 1), which included history
of seizures/epilepsy (80 participants) and antiseizure
medication (153 participants), with 51 reporting yes
to both criteria (high-sensitivity analysis; table e-1 at
Neurology.org). Individuals with LQTS are at an
increased risk of cardiac arrhythmias, which is one
mechanism for seizures.8,16 Despite this possibility, re-
sults from this study indicate that seizures were not
purely cardiogenic in origin (see limitation 2 in the
discussion section). Of note, as shown previously,8,10
we confirmed that b-blockers reduced the risk of car-
diac arrhythmias in LQTS1 participants (hazard ratio
[HR] 0.463, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.273–
0.784, p 5 0.004), yet b-blockers did not alter the
risk of seizures (HR 0.787, CI 0.49–1.27, p 5 0.324).
The LQTS1 and LQTS2 seizure cohorts each had
a higher percentage of females and longer QTc dura-
tions compared to those without seizures. LQTS1
participants were 3.0-fold more likely to have seiz-
ures, compared to LQTS2 participants (p , 0.001,
figure 1). Female LQTS1 and LQTS2 participants
were more likely than male participants of the same
genotype to have seizures (p , 0.05).
Within each QTc window, LQTS1 vs LQTS2
participants were 1.7- to 2.3-fold more likely to
have seizures. Also, with increasing QTc duration,
there was a higher prevalence of LQTS1 participants
with seizures (figure 2A, p , 0.05). Even account-
ing for the normal QTc duration being longer in
females, within each QTc window, there was a sig-
nificantly higher prevalence of female participants
with seizures.
The type of LQTS conferred a differential risk of
seizures. LQTS1 and LQTS2 cohorts had a higher
prevalence of seizures compared to the LQTS2 group
(figure 2B, p , 0.001). Despite no difference in QTc
duration between each type of LQTS (table 1, p 5
not significant), the LQTS2 group had the highest
percentage of participants with seizures (p , 0.05 vs
each LQTS1, LQTS3, and LQTS2). Also, with
increasing QTc, there was an increased prevalence
of LQTS2 participants with seizures (p , 0.001).

 LQTS1
and
LQTS2
participants
exhibited
a steady increase in the cumulative probability of seiz-
ures from birth to age 40 years (figure 2C, log rank
p , 0.001). Similar to sex- and age-dependent differ-
ences in the cumulative probability of cardiac
events,8,10 there was a sex- and age-dependent cross-
over of seizures occurring at 15 years of age when
female LQTS2 participants were at a higher risk
(z test, p , 0.05 at 30 and 40 years).
Time-dependent multivariate analyses confirmed
that LQTS2 (vs each LQTS2, LQTS1, and LQTS3),
QTc prolongation, and female sex between 15 and
40 years of age were each independent predictors of
seizures (figure 2D). In contrast to protection from
arrhythmias,10,16 time-dependent b-blocker treat-
ment did not alter the risk of seizures (figure 2D).
Region of the LQTS mutation predicts seizure status.
While the location of missense mutations in KCNQ1
(LQTS1) and KCNH2 (LQTS2) gene products are
predictive of cardiac events,7,9,10 its ability to predict
seizures remained unknown. None of the regions of
the KCNQ1 gene product (n 5 350) conferred a dif-
ference in the prevalence or risk of seizures.
Consistent with previous studies,7,9 KCNH2
pore mutations were an independent predictor of
cardiac arrhythmias (HR 2.01, 95% CI 1.11–
3.61, p 5 0.021). The percentage of LQTS2 par-
ticipants with seizures was highest in those with
mutations in the KCNH2 pore region (figure 3A;
S5-pore-S6: 32.1%, n 5 81; vs all other regions:
10.9%, n 5 193; p , 0.001). The pore region of
KCNH2 was an independent positive predictor of
seizures (figure 3B; HR 3.06, 95% CI 1.68–5.56,
p , 0.001). In contrast, the percentage of LQTS2
participants with mutations in the cNBD who had
seizures was lower compared to the sum of all other
regions (figure 3A; cNBD: 8.8%, n 5 80; vs all
other regions: 20.6%, n 5 194; p , 0.05). The
cNBD was a negative predictor of seizures (figure
3B; HR 0.39, 95% CI 0.17–0.88, p , 0.05) but
not arrhythmias.

 A
history
of
seizures
was
predictive
of
cardiac
arrhythmias. While QTc prolongation and increased
risk of arrhythmias are hallmarks of LQTS, those with
seizures had more severe cardiac ECG manifestations
(table 1). LQTS1, LQTS2, and LQTS1 participants
with seizures each had significantly longer QTc dura-
tions and a 5-fold higher rate of lethal cardiac
arrhythmias (figure 4).
Nearly 20% of LQTS1 participants with seizures
underwent ACA, in which they experienced a lethal
cardiac arrhythmia that required external defibrilla-
tion. LQTS1, LQTS2, and LQTS1 participants with
seizures had a higher prevalence and cumulative prob-
ability of cardiac arrhythmias compared to those
without seizures for each genotype (figure 4B; p ,
0.001; z test, p , 0.05 LQTS1 at 30 and 40 years,
LQTS2 at 10, 20, 30, and 40 years). Even after strat-
ifying LQTS1 participants by QTc window, the sei-
zure cohort had a higher percentage of participants
with cardiac arrhythmias (figure 4C; p , 0.05).
After adjustment for genotype, QTc duration, sex,
and b-blockers, seizures were the strongest indepen-
dent predictor of cardiac arrhythmias (figure 4D; HR
4.09, 95% CI 2.63–6.36, p , 0.001). In summary,
participants with a history of seizures exhibited more
pronounced cardiac manifestations, as evidenced by
greater QTc prolongation and a higher prevalence of
lethal cardiac arrhythmias.
High-sensitivity analysis: Seizure status. There were
potential limitations to the seizure group inclusion
criteria (see limitation 2 in the discussion section).
However, repeating the analyses for separate cohorts
for either only a history of seizures/epilepsy or only
having received antiseizure medication yielded results
similar to those observed above (table e-1). Of note,
an analysis using a more stringent high-sensitivity
inclusion criterion (i.e., both a history of seizure/
epilepsy and antiseizure medication) revealed similar
differences in seizure prevalence due to genotype,
QTc prolongation, and pore/cNBD LQTS2 muta-
tions (p , 0.05; figure e-1, A and C). Time-
dependent multivariate analyses confirmed that in
contrast to b-blockers, LQTS2, QTc prolongation,
and LQTS2 pore mutations were each independent
predictors of an increased risk of seizures (figure e-1,
B and D). In contrast to figure 2D, sex (age 15–40
years) was not a risk factor for seizures in this high-
sensitivity analysis.
High-sensitivity analysis further indicated that
LQTS1 and LQTS2 participants with seizures had
greater QTc prolongation compared to those without
seizures (figure e-2A). LQTS1, LQTS2, and LQTS1
participants with seizures had a higher prevalence of
arrhythmias (figure e-2, B and C), and seizure status
was associated with an increased risk of cardiac ar-
rhythmias (figure e-2D; HR 2.613, 95% CI 1.394–
4.898, p 5 0.0027).
DISCUSSION LQTS and seizure disorders lead to

and Lange-Nielsen syndrome have hearing loss.17

testinal symptoms.18 Neurocardiac pathologies have

 been found in Dravet syndrome,5,19,20 Brugada syn-
drome,21 CPVT (catecholaminergic polymorphic
ventricular tachycardia),22 SCN8A-mediated diseases,23
and HCN2-mediated diseases.24
Results from this study provided novel insights
into the risk factors for seizures. LQTS1, type of
LQTS, LQTS2 mutation domain, QTc duration,
and female sex were important biomarkers for pre-
dicting seizure susceptibility. QTc duration was sig-
nificantly longer in LQTS1 participants with seizures.
Seizures were the strongest independent positive risk
factor for cardiac arrhythmias.
While a single seizure does not define epilepsy,
the prevalence of LQTS2 participants with seizures
aligns with a 2% to 5% lifetime prevalence of seiz-
ures and 1% of Americans have epilepsy (table e-
1).25,26 Consistent with LQTS1–3 mutant genes
being expressed in the heart and brain,11–13 there
was a 3-fold higher prevalence of LQTS1 vs
LQTS2 participants with seizures. QTc prolonga-
tion is a positive risk factor for cardiac arrhythmias,
ACA, SCD,7,9 and now seizures. LQTS genotype
and phenotype provide potential biomarkers for
seizures.

 LQTS2 patients have the highest prevalence of
a personal or family history of seizures, documented
seizure/seizure-like episodes, and EEG recorded epi-
leptiform activity.1,3 Our study considered only a per-
sonal history of seizures, a 5.5-fold larger patient
cohort, and we conducted high-sensitivity analyses,
which yielded similar results. LQTS2 participants
were at the highest risk of seizures. In contrast to
the findings of Johnson et al. (2009),1 there was a sig-
nificantly higher prevalence of LQTS1 vs LQTS2
participants with seizures. LQTS3 participants were
not at a higher risk of seizures, yet these results need
to be confirmed with a larger sample size. Despite
similar QTc durations in each form of LQTS, the
type of LQTS conferred differing risks of seizures,
suggesting potential differences in the level and region
of LQTS1–3 gene expression in the brain.
More than 20% of people diagnosed with epilepsy
and heart rhythm disturbances have pathologic single
nucleotide variants in cardiac ion channel genes.27
While a previous study1 did not find an association
between seizures and the location of the mutation,
likely because of a lack of power, we found that the
mutation region altered the risk of cardiac arrhyth-
mias and seizures. Male LQTS2 participants7,9 with
KCNH2 pore mutations have longer QTc durations
and the highest risk of a cardiac event. We confirmed
these
previous
results,
plus
demonstrated
that
KCNH2 pore mutations were associated with an
increased risk of seizures.
KCNH2 cNBD mutations were an independent
negative predictor of seizures. While cyclic nucleoti-
des do not directly bind to the channel or modulate
the current, cNBD couples to the channel pore
through a C-linker and directly binds to the Per-
Arnt-Sim (PAS) domain in the N-terminus.28 In het-
erologous cells, cNBD mutations result in abnormal
ER processing/retention, Golgi transit, protein deg-
radation, reduced membrane localization, and loss of
function.29 Future mechanistic studies will determine
the effect of these mutations in native cardiac and
neuronal cells.
Sex hormones influence cardiac ion channel
expression, action potential morphology, dispersion
of repolarization across the myocardium, and the like-
lihood of cardiac arrhythmias.30 The risk of cardiac
events increases in female and diminishes in male
LQTS,
LQTS1,
and
LQTS2
individuals
after
puberty, and diminishes in females after meno-
pause.7,8,10 Sex hormones contribute to the emergence
of several forms of epilepsy at puberty and recede after
menopause.31 We observed a similar sex-dependent
crossover for the cumulative probability of seizures in
LQTS1 and LQTS2 participants during adolescence,
and female sex (age 15–40 years) was a biomarker for
seizures.
Recordings of the events surrounding SUDEP are
often not available. Thus, the clinical and genetic bi-
omarkers for SUDEP remain incompletely under-
stood. Since LQTS1 patients are at an increased
risk of both cardiac arrhythmias and seizures, they
provide an ideal cohort for assessing neurocardiac
electrical disturbances, potential triggers, and mecha-
nisms for SUDEP. A novel direction that this study
embarked on was to examine the cardiac manifesta-
tions in LQTS1 participants with seizures.

 The genes that are mutated in LQTS1–3 are ex-
pressed throughout the brain, particularly in brain-
stem ANS regions that provide direct brain–heart
connections and a likely pathway for neurocardiac
disease progression.11–13 Seizures within cortical lim-
bic regions disturb ANS tone, with changes in heart
rate, ECG measures, and increased rates of arrhyth-
mias and SUDEP.32,33 Patients with epilepsy exhibit
a progressive reduction in ANS tone.5,34 During
preictal, ictal, or postictal periods, there is a surge
of sympathetic tone, yet a few studies report
parasympathetic dominance.32,33 Thus, it is plausible
that seizure-induced sympathetic hyperexcitability po-
tentiates ECG pathologies, particularly since increased
sympathetic tone (exercise/arousal) is known to poten-
tiate arrhythmias in LQTS1–2.16
Baseline and interictal QTc durations are prolonged
in patients with epilepsy.4,5 There is often QT prolon-
gation, variability, and dispersion during the ictal
period,4,35 particularly in SUDEP patients.36 Seizure-
induced QTc prolongation, particularly in LQTS1 pa-
tients, may tip the balance leading to arrhythmogenesis.
Figure 4
LQTS1 participants with seizures exhibited more severe ECG manifestations
(A) Seizure cohort exhibited longer QTc durations (analysis of variance with Tukey test: LQTS2 and LQTS1 with and without seizures, p , 0.001; LQTS1, 2,
and 3, and LQTS2 with and without seizures, p , 0.001; ap , 0.05 vs genotype no seizure; bp , 0.05 vs LQTS2 no seizure; cp , 0.05 vs LQTS2 seizure;
dp , 0.05 vs LQTS1 no seizure; ep , 0.05 vs LQTS1 seizure; fp , 0.05 vs LQTS2 seizure). (B) Higher cumulative probability of cardiac arrhythmias in LQTS1
and LQTS2 participants with vs without seizures (log rank p , 0.001). (C) Within the same QTc window, there was a higher percentage of LQTS1 seizure
participants who developed arrhythmias (n 5 participants; Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test: LQTS1 no seizure; p , 0.001; LQTS1 seizure, p 5 not significant.
Chi square: p , 0.001; gp , 0.05 vs LQTS1 no seizure; normal QTc; hp , 0.05 vs LQTS1 no seizure; borderline QT prolongation; ip , 0.05 vs LQTS1 no seizure;
QTc prolongation. LQTS2 no seizure; R2 5 0.9999, slope 5 0.0939. LQTS1 seizure, R2 5 0.9568, slope 5 0.1631). (D) Multivariate analysis indicated
seizures were the strongest independent positive predictor of arrhythmias. LQTS 5 long QT syndrome; QTc 5 corrected QT interval.

 Conduction disturbances, bradycardia, asystole,
and atrial/ventricular arrhythmias are frequently
observed during ictal and postictal periods.35 Of note,
42% of LQTS1 participants with mutations at the
A341 site had a history of seizures (n 5 12). LQTS1
mice with the human equivalent of the A341E muta-
tion recapitulate the human phenotype of QTc pro-
longation, arrhythmias, and seizures.11,37 LQTS1
mice exhibit a high concurrence between seizures
and cardiac ECG abnormalities.11
Seizures were the strongest independent predictor
of cardiac arrhythmias. Because nearly 20% of LQTS
participants with seizures underwent ACA, they were
at the highest risk of SCD/SUDEP. Future studies
need to assess the efficacy of implantable cardiac de-
fibrillators in LQTS1 participants with seizures.
Genetic background, modifier genes, common
polymorphisms, and polygenic burden may augment
the risk of arrhythmias and seizures.38,39 These con-
tributing factors were partially accounted for in our
analyses by including LQTS1 and LQTS2 family
members of the proband. Poor seizure control and
sodium channel–blocking antiseizure drugs increase
the risk of arrhythmias.40
Limitations. Limitations of this study include the fol-
lowing 2 points. (1) The LQTS Registry is retrospective
until enrollment date, so information may be limited.
After enrollment, all information is prospective, with
improved temporal resolution. (2) Inclusion criteria
were based on patient/physician reports. As neurologic
records and EEG recordings were not available, we were
unable to use an expert panel to confirm seizure status,
severity, and etiology. Thus, it is possible that arrhyth-
mias may have been misdiagnosed as seizures, seizures
may have been mediated by arrhythmias, and in some
patients, antiseizure drugs may have been given for non-
seizure reasons (e.g., pain and mood stabilization.)
However, the following points minimize this concern:
(1) b-blockade reduced cardiac events, but did not alter
the risk of seizures; (2) inclusion criteria based solely on
seizure/epilepsy or antiseizure medication (table e-1)
and high-sensitivity analyses each yielded similar con-
clusions (table e-1; figures e-1 and e-2); (3) differences
were found in the increase in the cumulative probability
of seizures vs arrhythmias (figures 2C and 4B); (4)
LQTS3 participants had QTc prolongation (table 1)
and were at a high risk of arrhythmias (HR 22.682,
95% CI 4.971–103.488, p , 0.001) but not seizures
(figure 2B and D); (5) differences in the recovery phase
following seizures and syncope41; and (6) previous studies
align with our results of the coexistence and prevalence of
seizures in LQTS1 and LQTS2.1,3,11,25 While these
points do not eliminate the limitation of our inclusion
criteria, these finding suggest that seizures are present and
likely a distinct clinical manifestation of LQTS.
LQTS1 (particularly LQTS2), QTc prolongation,
LQTS2 pore/cNBD mutations, and female sex are
independent risk factors for seizures. In LQTS1 par-
ticipants, seizures are a significant predictor of cardiac
arrhythmias. This study establishes the basis for
future investigations into the mechanisms for neuro-
cardiac pathologies in LQTS. It remains unknown
whether the neurocardiac pathologies are the result
of (1) mutant gene coexpression in the heart and
brain; (2) seizure-induced ANS dysfunction promot-
ing arrhythmias; (3) cardiac arrhythmias leading to
cerebral hypoxia/ischemia-induced seizures; or (4)
pro- and antiarrhythmic/epileptic effects of medical
therapy. Regardless of the mechanism(s), it is critical
to take a multisystem approach to studying the neuro-
cardiac pathologies in genetic ion channel diseases.
LQTS includes a complex network of factors, which
coalesce to establish a substrate for the development
of electrical disturbances in the brain and the heart.
