Digital device usage has increased substantially in recent 
years across all age groups, so that extensive daily use 
for both social and professional purposes is now normal. 
Digital eye strain (DES), also known as computer vision 
syndrome, encompasses a range of ocular and visual 
symptoms, and estimates suggest its prevalence may be 
50% or more among computer users. Symptoms fall into 
two main categories: those linked to accommodative or 
binocular vision stress, and external symptoms linked to 
dry eye. Although symptoms are typically transient, they 
may be frequent and persistent, and have an economic 
impact when vocational computer users are affected. 
DES may be identified and measured using one of several 
available questionnaires, or objective evaluations of 
parameters such as critical flicker–fusion frequency, 
blink rate and completeness, accommodative function 
and pupil characteristics may be used to provide indices 
of visual fatigue. Correlations between objective and 
subjective measures are not always apparent. A range of 
management approaches exist for DES including correction 
of refractive error and/or presbyopia, management of dry 
eye, incorporating regular screen breaks and consideration 
of vergence and accommodative problems. Recently, 
several authors have explored the putative role of blue 
light-filtering spectacle lenses on treating DES, with 
mixed results. Given the high prevalence of DES and near-
universal use of digital devices, it is essential that eye care 
practitioners are able to provide advice and management 
options based on quality research evidence.
InTroduCTIon
Computer vision syndrome (CVS) is charac-
terised by a range of eye and vision-related 
symptoms and has been a recognised health 
problem for over 20 years.1 2 The terms visual 
fatigue (VF) and digital eye strain (DES) are 
also used for the condition, reflecting the 
variety of digital devices linked to potential 
problems. These expressions may be more 
appropriate for communication with patients 
and the public, who may not consider 
devices such as tablets and smartphones to 
be computers.3 Given the massive growth in 
digital device usage in recent years, many 
millions of individuals of all ages are at risk 
of DES. While symptoms are usually tran-
sient, the condition can cause significant, 
frequent, discomfort for sufferers and may 
have substantial economic consequences 
when vocational computer users are affected 
through increased errors and more frequent 
breaks.4 
The following review considers new findings 
in this active field. Recent data and informa-
tion on usage of digital devices, assessment 
techniques and management of the condi-
tion are presented. Furthermore, in addition 
to the more commonly described subjective 
techniques (ie, questionnaires) that are used 
in this area of research, objectively deter-
mined indicators of DES are considered.
use of digital devices
Across all age groups in developed nations, 
engagement with digital devices has increased 
substantially in recent years, particularly in the 
field of mobile media.5 A multination Euro-
pean study including England, reported that 
by 3 years of age, 68% of children regularly 
use a computer and 54% undertake online 
activities.6 In 2016, it was estimated that UK 
adults typically spend 4 hours 45 min per day 
using digital media,7 with a similar pattern in 
the USA, where approximately two-thirds of 
adults aged 30–49 years spend five or more 
hours on digital devices.8
In older age groups, use of technology 
is growing rapidly (figure 1) between 2011 
and 2017, the proportion of the population 
classed as ‘recent internet users’ (within the 
last 3 months) more than doubled in the 75 
years and over age group, and increased from 
52.0% to 77.5% in those aged 65–74 years.9 
Recent US data indicate that 37% of adults 
aged 60 years and over spend five or more 
hours per day using digital devices, and this 
age group prefers using laptops and desktops 
for browsing the internet, whereas younger 
adults are more likely to use smartphones 
for this purpose.8 Use of social media and 
multitasking is particularly prominent among 
younger adults with 87% of individuals aged 
20–29 years reporting use of two or more 
digital devices simultaneously.8

associated with DES are eyestrain, headaches, blurred 
vision, dry eyes and pain in the neck and shoulders. 
Asthenopia is the formal term for eye strain, for which two 
distinct mechanisms and sets of symptoms were described 
by Sheedy et al.11 External symptoms of burning, irritation 
and tearing and dryness were noted to be closely related 
to dry eye, while internal symptoms of strain, ache and 
headache behind the eyes were linked to accommodative 
and/or binocular vision stress. Similarly, Portello et al12 
also identified a clear split of computer-related symptoms 
into two categories: those associated with accommoda-
tion (namely, blurred vision at near, blurred distance 
vision after computer use and difficulty refocusing from 
one distance to another) and those that seemed linked 
to dry eye (irritated/burning eyes, dry eyes, eyestrain, 
headache, tired eyes, sensitivity to bright lights and eye 
discomfort).
The prevalence of DES has received attention in the 
scientific literature for over 20 years. Gauging prevalence 
is challenging due to the wide variety of usage conditions 
(both vocationally and socially) and substantial changes 
in these over time, along with the range of methodolo-
gies that have been applied to identify sufferers. Recent 
data, representative of contemporary devices and usage 
patterns, indicate that DES is a very common problem 
affecting many millions of individuals. The 2016 Digital 
Eye Strain report,8 which included survey responses 
from over 10 000 US adults, identified an overall self-re-
ported symptom prevalence of 65%, with females more 
commonly affected than males (69% vs 60% prevalence). 
DES was reported more frequently by individuals who 
used two or more devices simultaneously, compared with 
those using just one device at a time, with prevalences 
of 75% and 53%, respectively. The finding of greater 
computer-related symptoms in females was in agreement 
with 2012 findings among a cohort of 520 office workers 
in New York City12 and may be linked to gender differ-
ences in dry eye prevalence.13 14 For 10 defined symptoms, 
Portello et al12 documented that each symptom had been 
experienced by over 50% of respondents at least ‘some 
of the time’ during computer use within the last week. 
As shown in table 1, each symptom was reported half of 
the time or more during computer use over the last week 
in 17.3%–39.8% of respondents, highlighting the poten-
tially persistent and frequent nature of DES complaints.
Among 426 civil servants in Spain, the overall preva-
lence of DES (detected using a validated questionnaire)

was 53%.15 With six or more hours of computer use, 
contact lens wearers were more likely to be affected than 
non-wearers, with prevalences of 65% and 50%, respec-
tively. The finding was attributed to possible incomplete 
removal of superficial deposits with multipurpose lens 
care solutions and/or the mechanical interaction of sili-
cone hydrogel lenses with the ocular surface.15
Considering dry eye disease (DED) specifically in 
computer users, a recent meta-analysis including data 
from 11 365 individuals estimated an overall prevalence 
of 49.5%, ranging from 9.5% to 87. 5%.14 While these 
values appear higher than the 5%–33% DED prevalence 
observed in the general population,16 the heterogeneity 
of diagnostic criteria for DED used in studies to date mean 
that the overall figure has limited value. Standardised 
criteria for DED diagnosis and universal implementation 
would enable more robust estimates of the prevalence 
of the condition among computer users. The recent 
Tear Film and Ocular Surface Society Dry Eye Work-
shop II report included detailed recommendations for 
diagnostic methodology.17 Key proposals were symptom 
screening with either the Ocular Surface Disease Index 
(OSDI) or Dry Eye Questionnaire (DEQ-5) instruments, 
followed by objective clinical tests in DED suspects, 
including breakup time (preferably non-invasive), osmo-
larity and ocular surface staining with fluorescein and 
lissamine green.17
The problem of dry eye linked to digital device usage 
is not limited to adults. Recent studies based in South 
Korea have indicated that longer daily durations of both 
visual display terminal (VDT)18 and smartphone18 19 use 
are risk factors for DED in children. Cessation of smart-
phone use for a 4-week period in children with DED 
aged 7–12 years resulted in significant improvements 
in non-invasive tear breakup time, punctate epithelial 
erosion and OSDI scores, with all affected children no 
longer being classified as DED sufferers at the end of the 
abstinence period.19 The prevalence of DES in paediatric 
populations has received little attention in the literature 
to date, although a recent meta-analysis of available data 
linked to asthenopia in children20 reported a pooled 
prevalence of 19.7%. A scarcity of data in this field was 
highlighted, along with difficulties comparing studies 
due to the variation in methods. Given that asthenopia 
may impact on learning and school performance, and 
children are increasingly heavy users of digital devices, 
further research is needed to gauge the prevalence and 
consequences of the condition in children.
meAsurIng des
subjective methods
A variety of instruments have been used to identify DES 
sufferers and grade the severity of complaints. A 10-item 
questionnaire created by Hayes et al21 has been deployed 
in several subsequent studies12 22 and relates to the level 
of ocular discomfort experienced from the symptoms 
listed in table 1, enabling calculation of a total symptom 
score. The six-item Visual Fatigue Scale requires users 
to respond using a Likert scale to difficulties in seeing, 
strange feeling around the eyes, eyes feeling tired, feeling 
numb, having a headache and feeling dizzy looking at the 
screen. It has been applied to study symptoms following 
the use of e-readers, indicating that reading from liquid 
crystal display (LCD) screens (eg, tablet devices) triggers 
more subjectively reported VF than reading from paper 
copies or e-ink displays.23
The Rasch-based Computer-Vision Symptom Scale 
(CVSS17)24 was developed in Spanish to measure visual 
and ocular symptoms in computer users. An English 
version of the questionnaire may be obtained, although 
currently, normal CVSS values dependent on race and 
other factors are unknown. Seguí and colleagues25 
developed the first validated questionnaire in English 
to evaluate DES in the workplace. The self-administered 
Computer Vision Syndrome Questionnaire (CVS-Q) 
requires users to indicate the frequency and intensity 
of 16 symptoms experienced during computer use, 
allowing a single symptom severity score (CVS score) to 
be deduced, where six points or more is considered diag-
nostic of the condition. The CVS-Q was used to analyse 
CVS in contact lens wearers.15 Questionnaires with veri-
fied validity and reliability are useful tools to incorporate 
into regular patient care and clinical trials linked to 
ocular and visual health of workers engaged in computer 
use. Subjective questionnaires have also been used to 
provide additional validation for objective measures of 
VF,26 which are considered in the following section.
objective evaluation
Although DES affects a huge number of individuals, its 
precise physiological basis remains unclear. An array of 
measures of visual function have been used to provide 
indices of VF: accommodation parameters have received 
a significant amount of research attention given the 
accommodative nature of several DES symptoms, while 
critical flicker–fusion frequency (CFF) and blinking 
characteristics have been used regularly in recent DES 
research.
Critical flicker–fusion frequency
CFF is a recognised metric indicative of fatigue and mental 
workload27 and is the frequency at which a flickering 
light is indistinguishable from a steady, non-flickering 
light. A decline in this parameter has been attributed to 
reduced activity of the retina and/or optic nerve.28 Nega-
tive changes in CFF following a prolonged computer 
task were observed to correspond with certain subjective 
ocular complaints (pain in/around the eyes, eyes feeling 
heavy and itchy eyes) in a recent study on the effects of 
short wavelength-blocking spectacles,29 although not all 
studies using the measure have established a correlation 
between worsening of CFF and increased symptoms.30 31 
CFF may be influenced by task time, with Chi and Lin26 
reporting a significant increase in the sensitivity of this 
parameter to load differences when task duration was 
extended. For a 0.4 Hz tracking task, mean post-task CFF

reductions were 1.2±1.5 Hz and 2.2±0.7 Hz for 20 min 
and 60 min durations, respectively.26
blinking and squinting
Blinking aids maintenance of a normal ocular surface, 
with most blinks instigating a cycle of secretion, dispersal, 
evaporation and drainage of tears.32 Reduced blink rate 
with computer use has been observed in numerous 
studies33–35 and may be relevant to dry eye symptoms that 
frequently occur with DES. Reductions in blink rate may 
be substantial, for example, Patel et al33 reported a mean 
rate of 18.4 blinks/min before computer use, decreasing 
to 3.6 blinks/min during operation, while Tsubota and 
Nakamori35 observed a mean rate of 22 blinks/min 
among office workers under relaxed conditions, reducing 
to seven blinks/min when viewing an electronic display.
Sheedy et al36 hypothesised that reduced blink rate may 
be a consequence of involuntary squinting under symp-
tom-producing conditions, with squinting contributing to 
asthenopia. Two potential benefits arise from squinting: 
improvement in visual acuity with refractive error and 
decreasing retinal illumination in the presence of a glare 
source in the superior visual field.37 The voluntary squint 
response, measured using electromyography (EMG) of 
the orbicularis oculi, influences blink rate significantly, 
with greater squint levels causing more substantial reduc-
tion of blink rate.36 A later study,38 exposing participants 
to various asthenopic conditions during computer use 
including small font size, low contrast, induced refrac-
tive error and glare revealed that conditions that may 
be improved by squinting (refractive error and glare) 
showed an increased EMG response from the orbicularis 
oculi along with an increase in blink rate, while those that 
would not benefit from squinting (small font size and 
low contrast) showed no significant EMG response but a 
reduction in blink rate. Blink inhibition may arise from 
high cognitive demand or low-legibility conditions neces-
sitating a lengthening of fixation duration and allowing 
increased time to acquire visual information.
Increased cognitive demand (eg, reading more chal-
lenging material) exacerbates the effect of visual stressors 
such as low contrast or refractive error.39 Rosenfield et al40 
exposed 16 teenage subjects to texts of two distinct levels 
of cognitive demand, both on a modern tablet computer 
and hard copy printed versions. Changing the cognitive 
demand had a greater impact on blink rate than presen-
tation format. Mean blink rates for the low demand task 
were 8.34 and 9.06 blinks/min for the tablet and paper 
presentations, respectively, reducing significantly to 7.43 
and 6.67 blinks/min, respectively, for the high demand 
task. It is possible that technological improvements in 
digital displays mean that they are more similar to printed 
materials, so the substantial reductions in blink rate with 
computer use reported in older studies may not be indic-
ative of modern effects.
Although reduced blink rate may be a less pertinent 
issue now, many individuals continue to experience signs 
and symptoms of dry eye associated with digital device 
usage. Incomplete blinking, where the upper eyelid does 
not cover the entire corneal surface, may be more rele-
vant to dry eye than blink rate as tear film stability can 
be maintained with a reduced blink rate, providing that 
most blinks are complete.41 Incomplete blinking can 
result in increased evaporation and tear film break up 
due to reduced tear film thickness in the inferior corneal 
region.42 Argilés et al43 observed a reduction in blink rate 
during reading tasks on tablet and computer displays 
(table 2), as well as hard copy text. However, reading 
from a hard copy was associated with a significantly lower 
proportion of incomplete blinks (0%–5%) compared 
with reading from a tablet (14.5%), expanded computer 
display (13.5%) or electronic reading (9%; see table 2). 
The specific influence of digital devices on incomplete 
blinks is unclear, and further research is needed to 
address this issue, along with the possible benefits of 
blink training.
Accommodative effects
To perform near tasks comfortably, pre-presbyopes must 
be able to accommodate rapidly and smoothly and main-
tain an accurate response.44 The lag of accommodation 
when viewing computer displays has been studied by 
several authors. Wick and Morse45 reported from a small 
sample of young adults that lag (measured with an open-
view autorefractor) was approximately 0.33 D higher in 4 
of 5 participants when reading from a VDT compared with 
printed material, although Penisten et al46 found similar 
lags (by dynamic retinoscopy) in printed and VDT condi-
tions. More recently, Collier and Rosenfield47 reported a 
stable mean lag of approximately 0.93 D among 20 adults 
during a 30 min laptop-based task. Notably, no differ-
ences in static accommodation responses were identified 
between the most symptomatic and least symptomatic

groups, although the task duration may not characterise 
heavy usage patterns of digital devices.
The accommodative response to a stationary near target 
exhibits microfluctuations—small temporal variations in 
power of up to 0.25 D,48 49 comprising a low frequency 
component (LFC) of <0.6 Hz and a high frequency 
component (HFC) of 1.0–2.3 Hz.50 The HFC derives 
from arterial pulse effects, while the LFC is believed to 
be important in the maintenance of steady-state accom-
modation. Thus, examination of the microfluctuations 
may give an insight into the accuracy of the negative 
feedback control system of the accommodative response 
to any stimuli,51 including digital screens. Iwasaki and 
Kurimoto52 reported increased microfluctuations after 
VDT use, but not after paper work. However, their anal-
ysis of microfluctuations (from 0 Hz to 1.5 Hz) did not 
permit differentiation between the LFC and HFC. Gray 
et al51 explored microfluctuations in five asymptomatic 
young adults performing a 20 min task with five different 
displays, including hard copy, cathode ray tube and LCD. 
Overall, no change in the LFC or HFC was observed as 
the task progressed, and no difference between display 
types was reported. One subject did display a significant 
increase in LFC power at the conclusion of tasks, particu-
larly for hard copy and electroluminescent panel display. 
Analysis of microfluctuations could prove more valu-
able in symptomatic individuals, providing information 
on subtle changes in the accommodative response with 
different display conditions, although this parameter has 
been studied relatively little in relation to DES, possibly 
due to the highly specialised laboratory requirements.
Accommodative facility, the ability to make rapid 
changes in accommodation response, may be pertinent 
to computer use, as switching fixation from the screen 
to other material or into the distance occurs frequently. 
Among 153 symptomatic computer users examined at a 
specialist clinic, poor accommodative facility was the most 
common diagnosis, detected in 31 (20.3 %) patients.53 
Rosenfield et al54 examined accommodative facility in 22 
young, visually normal subjects, before and after a 25 min 
desktop computer task. No significant change in monoc-
ular facility was observed, while binocular values improved 
somewhat post-task. Furthermore, as no relationship 
was established between symptoms and accommodative 
facility, the conclusion that poor accommodative facility 
was not linked to ocular fatigue was made. Whether these 
results are broadly applicable to sufferers of DES is ques-
tionable as these young, visually normal subjects reported 
relatively low symptom scores, and the task duration may 
not have been sufficient to result in significant changes 
in accommodative parameters. Chi and Lin26 highlighted 
improved sensitivity of several parameters linked to VF, 
including accommodation power and visual acuity, when 
task duration was extended from 20 min to 60 min.
pupillary light reflex and size
Along with accommodation and convergence, the pupil 
response is the third component of the near triad. 
Changes in pupillary characteristics and response have 
been explored as potential indicators of VF. Monitoring 
pupil diameter within-task has led to the hypothesis 
that an increase in pupil size indicates VF, due to detri-
mental effects on depth of focus.26 Task type has been 
shown to influence changes in pupil diameter, with 
more demanding tasks, such as faster on-screen presen-
tation of figures55 and tracking (rather than reading or 
monitoring), causing greater increases in pupil diam-
eter, although only a weak correlation with subjective 
complaints has been established.26Gray et al51 reported 
a significant overall increase in pupil size during 20 min 
tasks on various displays, with the effect observed in 3 of 
5 visually normal subjects.
After effects have been reported in up to 33% of 
individuals following intense near work,56 where the 
pupil may retain a somewhat constricted state after task 
completion. Saito et al57 noted reduced pupil diameter 
and increased amplitude of pupillary reflexes following 
a prolonged VDT task, postulating that spasms of the 
sphincter pupillae and ciliary muscle may be responsible. 
Dynamic recording of pupil size and refractive error 
using an open-view autorefractor as described by Gray 
et al51 could facilitate analysis of post-task pupil recovery 
when after effects are present while also enabling study 
of within task accommodative response (accuracy) and 
pupil size.
Aggravating factors and management of des
Numerous factors are believed to contribute to DES, 
and it has been asserted that a combination of symp-
tom-inducing factors may increase the magnitude of 
symptoms.58 Therapeutic interventions may be broadly 
separated into treatment of dry eye, correction of refrac-
tive error and management of accommodation and 
vergence anomalies. The use of commercially available 
blue-blocking spectacle lenses as a possible treatment for 
DES has also attracted some interest recently.
management of dry eye
Dry eye is considered a significant aetiology of DES, with 
factors such as altered blinking characteristics, environ-
mental influences and gaze angle considered relevant 
to dryness with digital device use. Office environments 
commonly feature low humidity, ventilation fans, air 
conditioning and airborne dust/toner particles, which 
may promote corneal drying.59 Desktop computer screens 
are frequently viewed in horizontal gaze, thus the palpe-
bral aperture is wider than for conventional reading tasks 
(or laptop/tablet use), which are usually performed in 
downgaze. Consequently, a larger ocular surface area is 
exposed to the effects of tear film evaporation.58 59
Use of lubricating eye drops has been shown to reduce 
symptoms such as tiredness, dryness and difficulty focusing 
during sustained computer use,60 although complete 
resolution of symptoms may not occur.61 A randomised 
controlled study of 478 symptomatic computer users 
(>3 hours per day) demonstrated a beneficial effect of

dietary supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids on dry 
eye signs and symptoms, with 70% in the treatment group 
being symptom free after 3 months.62
Given the impact of digital device usage on blinking 
characteristics, blink training may be helpful in the 
management of DES symptoms linked to dry eye. 
Increasing blink rate through use of an audible prompt 
signal every 4 s during a computer task was not found to 
alter symptom scores,63 although blink efficiency exer-
cises to reduce the number of incomplete blinks may be 
more appropriate given the link between screen use and 
incomplete blinking.
refractive error and presbyopia
Correction of refractive error (notably astigmatism) and 
presbyopia is accepted as an important intervention in 
DES sufferers. Double-masked, randomised studies have 
established that even 0.50–1.00 D of uncorrected simu-
lated astigmatism impacts negatively on subjective visual 
comfort,64 65while 1.00–2.00 D of induced or natural 
astigmatic error may increase task errors by up to 370% 
and reduce productivity of computer workers substan-
tially.4 Uncorrected astigmatism may be a particular issue 
among presbyopic patients using off-the-shelf reading 
spectacles and contact lens wearers with undercorrected 
or uncorrected cylindrical errors.
The variety of working distances involved in using 
different digital devices can prove problematic for indi-
viduals requiring a near vision add. Small fonts are 
common on smartphones due to reduced screen size, 
and a mean working distance of 32.2 cm was established 
in adults undertaking a web-based smartphone task,66 
which may reduce during prolonged viewing.67 Minimum 
viewing distances of 500–635 mm68 69 have been recom-
mended for computer monitors, while working distances 
of around 500 mm,70 or slightly less with increased age,71 
are typical for e-readers. Consequently, a single near 
add may not provide adequate vision across the range of 
demand levels, meaning that multiple prescriptions or 
an occupational correction (eg, combining intermediate 
and near prescriptions) are required. Computer glasses, 
with progressive lenses designed to optimise vision in the 
intermediate and near regions, may reduce symptoms 
in presbyopic computer users to a greater extent than 
ergonomic intervention,72while a 2004 study indicated 
that over a 12-month period, some designs of computer 
lenses provided greater overall satisfaction and improved 
subjective evaluation of area of clear vision than single 
vision spectacles.73
UK employees using display screen equipment (DSE) 
habitually as a significant part of their work are enti-
tled to a sight test funded by their employer, along with 
spectacles specifically for screen use.74 According to 
College of Optometrists guidance on examining DSE/
computer users,75 practitioners should carry out a full 
eye examination to determine the cause of any visual 
problems associated with screen use, ask the patient to 
describe their workstation and environment and provide 
appropriate advice including ergonomic information. 
Despite near-universal use of digital devices, little is 
known regarding the interpretation of this guidance 
or how UK optometrists examine and advise patients 
regarding digital device usage, whether for professional 
or social purposes. To optimise patient care, increased 
education of optometrists and opticians regarding DES 
could be advantageous, given the high prevalence of the 
condition and continuing research developments in this 
active field, which may not be covered in detail in under-
graduate training programmes.
Accommodation and vergence anomalies
Accommodative anomalies including poor facility and 
high lag may reduce visual comfort during nearwork, 
including computer use. Clinically, accommodative 
facility may be assessed with plus and minus sphere flipper 
lenses while the patient fixates a near target, counting 
the number of cycles ‘cleared’ in 1 min (cpm).76 With the 
conventional ±2.00 D flippers at 40 cm, 11 cpm has been 
described as the cut-off between symptomatic and asymp-
tomatic adults,76 although more recent research suggests 
that facility testing should take into account the amplitude 
of accommodation of individual patients and be scaled 
accordingly.77 Lag of accommodation is usually assessed 
by dynamic retinoscopy, with the distance-corrected 
patient fixating a near target.78 Ophthalmic practitioners 
should examine visual function at the distances at which 
screens are used by individual patients58 to ensure clear 
vision at appropriate task distances. The American Opto-
metric Association promotes the 20-20-20 rule (a 20 s 
break every 20 min to view a distant object at 20 feet) to 
alleviate DES.10 Frequent short breaks can relax accom-
modative and vergence responses, attenuating asthenopic 
symptoms without impairing productivity.79 80
Vergence dysfunctions include various motor disorders, 
for example, convergence insufficiency, decompensated 
heterophoria and poor vergence facility. Individuals 
with binocular vision problems experience greater visual 
symptoms with prolonged use of the eyes.81 82 Vergence 
characteristics have been studied with respect to computer 
operation, producing mixed results. Watten and 
colleagues reported significant reductions in vergence 
ranges (assessed by increasing base in and base out prism 
power, until blur experienced) at the end of the working 
day,83 although other authors have shown no differences 
in vergence functions between individuals involved in 
computer work and those not using a computer.84–86 
Rosenfield et al54 reported no change in vergence facility 
(ability to make rapid changes in vergence response, 
using alternate presentation of base out and base in 
prism) following a 25 min computer task. Later work indi-
cated no variation in associated phoria during computer 
work, although notably, the least symptomatic individuals 
had a mean associated phoria of 1.55Δ base in, that is, 
a slightly reduced vergence response.47 Around 20% of 
individuals were found to prefer an induced small exo-as-
sociated phoria compared with an ortho condition,

blue light
Exposure to blue light (400–500 nm) can be harmful 
to 
the 
retina, 
particularly 
suprathreshold, 
acute 
doses,87 88 with peak light damage occurring around 
440 nm.89 Longer duration, less intense light exposure 
can also induce photochemical damage.90While some 
concern has been expressed regarding blue light emitted 
from digital screens, recent research indicated that the 
low levels of blue light from such devices do not repre-
sent a biohazard, even for long-term viewing.91 Newer 
forms of low energy lighting, including LEDs, emit less 
infrared radiation than their incandescent predecessors, 
but significantly more blue light leading to the sugges-
tion that harmful cumulative exposures could occur.89 92 
Theoretically, commercially available blue light-filtering 
spectacle lenses reduce phototoxicity by 10.6%–23.6%, 
without degrading visual performance, and have thus 
been suggested as a supplementary aid for protecting the 
eyes against the blue light hazard.93
Light exposure is also the main factor involved in 
setting circadian rhythms. Melatonin hormone is 
released in dim light conditions and is involved in the 
physiological control of sleep. Its release from the 
pineal gland is controlled by a pathway originating from 
the intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells 
containing melanopsin, which has a peak sensitivity 
of approximately 482 nm,94 that is, longer wavelength 
blue-turquoise light. Exposure to short wavelength light 
(including digital devices) before bedtime can disrupt 
sleep patterns,95 96while use of short wavelength blocking 
spectacles in the evening can improve sleep duration and 
quality97 98 and reduce subjective alertness.99
Blue light emitted by digital devices has also been impli-
cated as a cause of DES. Isono and colleagues100 reported 
reduced subjective complaints and smaller reductions 
in CFF in young adults when reading from a sepia back-
ground (reduced blue light contribution) compared with 
the conventional white background of a modern tablet 
device. Although cited by Lin et al29 in their rationale for 
exploring the impact of blue-blocking spectacles on eye 
fatigue, the small sample size means that the results must 
be interpreted with caution.
Given both the putative link between the blue 
light emitted from modern digital devices and ocular 
complaints and the commercial availability of blue-fil-
tering lenses for treatment of DES, several authors have 
explored the impact of blue light-reducing spectacles 
on symptoms and objective measures of VF29 31 101 (see 
table 3). There is a lack of consensus in the findings of 
these studies, and a recent systematic review of the liter-
ature called for high-quality research, ideally in the form 
of randomised control trials, to address the health effects 
of blue blocking spectacle lenses.102
Cheng et al101 showed no improvement in Schirmer 
test results when dry eye and non-dry eye participants 
used low-blocking, medium-blocking and high-blocking 
wraparound goggles but did report reduced symptoms 
with all levels of filter in patients with dry eye. Of note 
is the lack of a control lens in the study and potential 
placebo effect, while the wraparound style of goggles 
means that reduced tear film evaporation in addition 
to blue-light reduction may have impacted the results. 
Following a 2-hour computer task, Ide et al31 reported 
a significantly greater reduction in CFF in participants 
wearing control lenses, compared with those with high or 
low blue-blocking properties, although no differences in

subjective questionnaires were observed between groups. 
More recently, Lin et al29 measured improved post-
task CFF in subjects wearing high-blocking spectacles 
compared with low-block or no block lenses and reported 
that 3 of 15 symptoms (pain in/around the eyes, eyes 
feeling heavy and eyes feeling itchy) were lower in the 
high-blocking group, indicating that short-wavelength 
filtering spectacles may attenuate both some symptoms 
of DES and clinical CFF measurement. Notably, the 
high-blocking spectacles used had an obvious yellow 
colouration with the transmission spectrum indicating 
some filtering effect across a range visible wavelengths. 
Recent research in an animal model has demonstrated 
that exposure to violet visible light may suppress myopia 
progression103; if this finding translates to human eyes, 
there would be implications for use of short-wavelength 
blocking lenses in young people at risk of myopigenesis 
or progression.
Further to improving subjective comfort, management 
of DES among computer workers may confer significant 
economic advantages. The experience of symptoms can 
reduce work accuracy,104 105 extend the time required to 
complete tasks4 and necessitate more frequent breaks.12 
Following a double-blind study, it was estimated that 
provision of spectacles to correct small refractive errors 
in pre-presbyopic employees would increase productivity 
by at least 2.5%,4 indicating a favourable cost-to-benefit 
ratio of this intervention. Furthermore, the implemen-
tation of short, frequent breaks can enhance working 
efficiency, adequately compensating for time spent away 
from the screen.79 106
ConClusIons
Usage of digital devices for work and social purposes, 
often for many hours each day, is now normal among 
individuals of all ages. While there are challenges in 
determining the prevalence of DES, levels of 50% or more 
have been reported in numerous published studies, indi-
cating that a large proportion of the population are at 
risk, and may seek advice and/or treatment linked to the 
condition. Eye care professionals are well placed to advise 
on DES, with professional bodies such as the College of 
Optometrists (UK) and the American Optometric Asso-
ciation providing some guidance for practitioners. To 
provide optimum patient care related to the condition, it 
is essential that eye care practitioners are well informed 
regarding DES and the growing evidence base in this 
field.
DES symptoms may be split into those linked to 
dry eye (external symptoms), and internal symptoms 
related to ametropia, accommodation or vergence 
problems. Accommodative and/or vergence issues with 
computer use seem to be a consequence of demanding 
near work, rather than screen use per se. Nevertheless, 
such symptoms still require management to promote 
comfortable viewing. Treatment of dry eye, even mild 
cases, may have a substantial influence on comfort with 
screen use.
Questionnaires are of value in evaluating DES as they 
are simple to implement and capture patient experiences, 
although validated instruments are rare. In evaluating 
putative DES treatments, questionnaires have frequently 
been used alongside objective measures linked to VF, 
although correlation between objective and subjective 
assessments has not always been apparent. Regardless of 
the type of intervention proposed (eg, management of 
dry eye, correction of refractive error, use of computer 
spectacles or blue-blocking lenses), persistent effects of 
treatment should be explored to indicate the true value 
of DES management options. With the high prevalence 
of DES and near-universal use of digital devices, it is 
paramount that the condition is considered by eye care 
practitioners, and treatment options are supported by 
available research evidence.
