Objective: This research aimed to characterize HIV testing
rates among Medicaid recipients with severe mental illness
who received public specialty mental health services.
Methods: This retrospective cohort study examined California
Medicaid records from October 1, 2010, to September 30,
2011 (N=56,895). Study participants were between age 18 and
67, utilized specialty mental health care services, were pre-
scribed antipsychotic medications, and were not dually eligible
for Medicare. Adjusted Poisson regression models were used to
estimate the overall effects of predictor variables on HIV testing
prevalence.
Results: During the study period, 6.7% of people with severe
mental illness received HIV testing. Men were 32% less likely
to be tested for HIV than women (p,.001). Compared with
whites, Asians/Pacific Islanders were 53% less likely and
blacks were 82% more likely to be tested (p,.001). Those
with comorbid drug or alcohol use disorders were more
likely to be tested than those without such disorders
(p,.001). Utilization of nonpsychiatric medical care was the
strongest predictor of HIV testing (p,.001).
Conclusions: Most adults with severe mental illness receiving
public specialty mental health services were not tested for
HIV during a one-year period. Public health administrators
must prioritize HIV testing for early identification of HIV in-
fection and prevention of HIV transmission.

Persons with severe mental illness, such as schizophrenia,
bipolar disorder, and major depression with psychosis, die
25 years earlier than the general population (1,2). Although
most of this mortality is due to cardiovascular disease, two
recent meta-analyses found median HIV prevalence rates
ranging from 1.8% to 6% (3,4). Although studies reviewed in
these analyses were limited by small sample sizes, variable
time frames, and variable methods of ascertainment, the
prevalence of HIV among persons with severe mental illness
is consistently reported to be greater than in the general U.S.
population (.5%) and contributes to the early mortality in
this population. The increased HIV prevalence among per-
sons with severe mental illness is not likely the result of
a psychiatric illness–mediated biological predisposition to
HIV but rather appears to be driven by higher rates of HIV-
related risk behaviors. For example, people with severe
mental illness report higher rates of unprotected sex, in-
jection drug use, substance use in the context of sexual ac-
tivity, and sexual violence than persons in the general
population and a greater likelihood of encountering sexual
partners with HIV infection (5–8).
A 2009 systematic review reported that HIV testing rates
among people with severe mental illness were low (9). Un-
fortunately, the review was based on a series of studies with
small samples, which resulted in wide ranges of recent
(17%249%) and lifetime (11%289%) HIV testing rates (9). A
recent cross-sectional study evaluated HIV testing among
persons with mental illness in the 2007 National Health
Interview Survey (10). This study found that those with any
mental illness (including depression and anxiety) were more
likely than the general population to report ever being tested
for HIV (10). Although this was a study of persons with
mental illness, the sample size for those with severe mental
illness was quite low (N=108 for schizophrenia, and N=292
for bipolar disorder) (10). The small sample sizes in all of
these studies reflect the difficulty of examining medical care
received by people with severe mental illness because of the
segregation of primary care and behavioral health care that
is characteristic of the U.S. public health care system (11).
This study filled this gap in the literature by examining
a unique data set that combined public mental health and
general medical care data for Medicaid enrollees. Because

 racial-ethnic minority populations have higher rates of HIV
than the general population (12,13), the large size of this
retrospective cohort also permitted analyses of disparities in
HIV testing among racial-ethnic minority populations with
severe mental illness. To our knowledge, this is the first large
study examining HIV testing among people receiving spe-
cialty mental health services.
METHODS
Study Design
This retrospective cohort study utilized administrative,
pharmacy, and billing data from California Medicaid (Medi-
Cal) and the Client and Service Information (CSI) system for
the period October 1, 2010, to September 30, 2011. The CSI
system is an encounter-based data system that is funded by
the state and county and used to track utilization of non-
inpatient mental health services across California (14). The
study was approved by the University of California, San
Francisco, Committee of Human Research (11–06939); the
State of California Committee for the Protection of Human
Subjects (FWA00000681); and the Data and Research
Committee of the California Department of Health Care
Services (DHCS) (IRB00000552). Following approval,
DHCS combined these databases, deidentified the data, and
provided a unique data set. Data were made available be-
cause we were helping DHCS’s public partners examine the
efficacy of a separate statewide quality improvement project.
Population
As of January 1, 2011, 7,505,841 people in California were
enrolled in Medicaid (15). The following inclusion criteria
generated the study cohort: age $18 years and ,68, Medi-Cal
enrollee, specialty mental health care utilization during the
study period, prescription of one or more antipsychotic
medications during the study period, and not dually eligible
for Medicare. [A list of the prescribed antipsychotic medica-
tions is available in an online supplement to this article.] Of
note, prescription claims for antipsychotic medications were
used to define the cohort for a parent study examining di-
abetes screening (16). In California eligibility for specialty
mental health care is limited to individuals who meet medical
necessity criteria by being diagnosed as having a “serious and
disabling mental disorder” (17). The dually eligible population
was excluded because Medicare laboratory billing data
(which supersedes Medicaid data) were unavailable. We were
not able to exclude people living with HIV; DHCS would not
provide this level of data because of confidentiality concerns.
Measures
The primary outcome measure was evidence of HIV-1 or
HIV-2 antibody testing (CPT codes 86701, 86702, 86703,
87390, or S3645). The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force
recommends annual HIV testing for populations at highest
risk (men who have sex with men and active injection drug
users) and testing every three to five years for those at increased
risk of HIV infection (having unprotected vaginal or anal in-
tercourse; having sexual partners who areHIVinfected, bisexual,
or injection drug users; or exchanging sex for drugs or money)
(18). Because people with severe mental illness are much more
likely than the general population to fall into the categories of
either highest risk or increased risk (5–8), we determined that
a year-long period was a reasonable time frame to examine evi-
dence of HIV testing. The database included additional variables:
age, gender, race-ethnicity, county, antipsychotic medications,
and nonpsychiatric medical office visits (new patients, CPT
codes 99201–99205; established outpatients, 99211–99215; and
other outpatient consultations, 99241–99245). All axis I di-
agnoses of mental and substance use disorders were collected
from the CSI system and determined by mental health providers.
Axis I diagnoses of mental disorders (not including substance use
disorders) were hierarchically categorized as follows: schizo-
phrenia spectrum disorder, bipolar disorder, major depressive
disorder, anxiety disorder, and other. Counties were dichoto-
mized into rural or urban according to 2013 National Center for
Health Statistics definitions (19).
Statistical Analysis
Adjusted Poisson regression models were used to estimate the
overall effects on prevalence of HIV testing of gender, race-
ethnicity, age group, county type (rural versus urban), di-
agnosis, and history of use of substance use disorder treatment
and nonpsychiatric outpatient health care. We used a directed
acyclic graph to identify confounders and mediators of each
predictor. Models specific to each predictor of interest were
used to estimate overall effects by adjusting for common causes
of each predictor and HIV testing (confounders) but excluding
factors on the causal pathway between them (mediators) (20).
Models excluding confounders would provide biased esti-
mates, whereas models including mediators would at best es-
timate direct effects via other pathways. Poisson regression
was used as the best approximation of prevalence ratio.
Because mental health service delivery is realigned from
the state to the county levels in California, we used robust
standard errors to account for clustering of outcomes by
county and to accommodate the use of a Poisson model for a
binary outcome (Stata version 13.2) (20). Seven rural coun-
ties (12%) had few observations and were grouped with
counties of similar size, region, and demographic charac-
teristics (19). For example, we aggregated data from three
rural counties: Alpine, Inyo, and Mono. We excluded data
from San Mateo County, because we did not have access to
the separate county pharmacy billing system that would
identify the cohort taking antipsychotic medications.
RESULTS
This study cohort represented .76% of all Medicaid recipients
in California in 2011 (N=56,895 of 7,505,841). Over a year-long
period, 6.7% (N=3,815) of study participants received HIV
testing. Table 1 shows differences in the characteristics of
participants who did and did not receive HIV testing. Table 2

justed relative risk of HIV
testing in relation to various
predictor variables.
After adjustment for po-
tential confounders for each
predictor variable (see foot-
notes in Table 2), men were
less likely than women to be
tested for HIV (adjusted risk
ratio [ARR]=.68 p,.001). In
addition, older adults were
dramatically less likely than
adults ages 18–27 to receive
HIV testing (ARR=.63). Com-
pared with rates among
whites, HIV testing rates
were significantly lower
among Asians/Pacific Is-
landers (ARR=.47, p,.001)
but higher among blacks
(ARR=1.82, p,.001). No other
racial-ethnic disparities in
HIV testing were found.
There was some variability
in HIV testing by psychiatric
diagnosis (p,.001).
In contrast, participants
with comorbid drug or alco-
hol use disorders were some-
what more likely than those
without such disorders to be tested for HIV (adjusted RR=1.47,
p,.001). Participants with evidence of use of nonpsychiatric
outpatient medical care were more than twice as likely to
be tested for HIV than those who did not use such care
(adjusted RR=2.29, p,.001).
DISCUSSION
This large retrospective cohort study of adults with severe
mental illness served within California’s public mental health
care system generated three main findings that have important
public health implications. First, only 6.7% of individuals in this
sample received HIV testing during a one-year period—clearly
a missed prevention opportunity. This low testing rate is con-
cerning given the high prevalence of HIV risk factors and HIV
infection in this population. Best estimates find HIV prevalence
among those with severe mental illness to be as much as
tenfold higher than in the general U.S. population (3). In
addition, despite the high prevalence of HIV risk behaviors
among persons with severe mental illness, this testing rate
is not much higher than the 2011 self-reported HIV
testing rate among California’s general population (5.2%)
(21). Because effective treatments for HIV are widely available
in the United States and people with severe mental illness ap-
pear to adhere to antiretroviral therapy at rates similar to rates
in other groups (22), this lack of testing is a missed prevention
opportunity to detect HIV early in the course of illness, thus
reducing the risk of disease progression to AIDS and preventing
its spread to others.
HIV testing is central to national efforts to reduce infection
rates, with the hope of eventually eradicating HIV. In 2010,
it was estimated that nearly 76% of HIV-positive individuals
in the United States knew their HIV status—likely because of
2006 efforts by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
to increase routine HIV testing (23,24). Because individuals
with severe mental illness are much more likely to be at high
risk or increased risk of HIV infection compared with the
general population (5–8,18) and evidence suggests that there
is room to improve regarding obtaining sexual risk histories
(25,26), we believe that annual HIV testing should be strongly
considered by public mental health administrators. Yearly
HIV testing among persons with severe mental illness could
fit naturally with guideline-recommended metabolic screen-
ing for individuals taking antipsychotic medications.
Second, it is notable that use of nonpsychiatric outpatient
medical care was the only modifiable factor that was asso-
ciated with higher rates of HIV testing among adults with
severe mental illness. This finding supports the importance
of national efforts to integrate behavioral health and pri-
mary care, although we do not know whether increased

 comorbidity drove these nonpsychiatric medical care vis-
its. Notably, many of the large primary and behavioral
health care integration pilot programs funded by the
Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Adminis-
tration found that access to primary care alone was not
sufficient to improve general medical outcomes, and many
of these programs were fiscally unsustainable (27). In
addition, most of these programs narrowly focused on car-
diovascular risk reduction (27,28). Given the high preva-
lence of HIV and other blood-borne infections among
people with severe mental illness (3), we strongly suggest
expanding the focus of efforts to integrate care beyond
cardiovascular risk reduction to include HIV testing and
expanding approaches to reducing high-risk sexual and
drug use behaviors.
Individuals with severe mental illness have low rates of
primary care utilization overall (29), but they do use com-
munity mental health clinics (30). Therefore, we believe that
there is an opportunity to expand the scope of practice of
community psychiatrists to take more responsibility for
certain aspects of their patients’ medical care. We found that
primary care providers and psychiatrists are at odds re-
garding who is responsible for conducting medical screen-
ing and treatment of this patient population, even when it
comes to guideline-recommended metabolic testing (31,32).
Because HIV testing is potentially more complicated and
stigmatizing than metabolic testing, we believe that public
mental health care system leaders should prioritize edu-
cating psychiatrists about the importance of HIV testing to
reduce disease progression and transmission in this vul-
nerable population.
Finally, we found that rates of HIV testing differed among
subgroups with severe mental illness; older adults, in par-
ticular, were much less likely to be tested for HIV. Eleven
percent of new HIV infections occur among adults ages
50 and older, and older individuals are more likely to receive
a diagnosis of HIV infection later in the course of the disease
(29–31). These late diagnoses lead to impaired quality of life
and reduced life expectancy in this population. Because 42%
of our study participants were between age 48 and 67, a lack
of prioritization of HIV testing in this age group constitutes
another missed opportunity for prevention.
We also found low rates of HIV testing among Asians/
Pacific Islanders, a finding consistent with other reports
(33). Because Asians/Pacific Islanders are the only racial-
ethnic group to experience an increase in HIV/AIDS di-
agnosis in recent years and studies indicate that testing rates
increase if testing sites are culturally appropriate and testing
is provided in a safe environment (34), this appears to be
another missed prevention opportunity. Our findings that
black participants and persons with comorbid substance use
disorders were more likely to be tested for HIV suggest that

LOW RATES OF HIV TESTING AMONG ADULTS WITH SEVERE MENTAL ILLNESS
 clinicians are appropriately targeting screening efforts to
some subpopulations at highest risk of HIV infection.
However, the fact that HIV testing rates for blacks and
persons with comorbid substance use disorders were only
10.8% and 9.6%, respectively, suggests that there is still
significant room for improvement among these high-risk
populations.
The major limitation of this study was our reliance on a
large administrative database, including the CSI data sub-
mitted by counties to track mental health service utilization
(14). Because dually eligible (Medicaid and Medicare) pa-
tients were not included, HIV testing rates may not reflect
the population with severe mental illness as a whole, espe-
cially those over age 65. Extrapolation to newly enrolled
patients may also be limited. In addition, HIV testing that
was not billed to Medicaid (for example, bundled with other
services during an inpatient hospital admission) was not
captured, which could have led to an underestimation of
screening rates.
Generalizability is a concern with use of databases with
claims from a single state. In addition, the lack of a control
group made direct comparisons challenging. We could not
determine whether HIV testing was performed for people
with a preexisting HIV infection, because we were not
provided with HIV-related ICD-9 diagnosis codes. This
decision was made by the Data and Research Committee of
the California DHCS in an effort to avoid threatening the
confidentiality of persons in rural counties. In addition,
prescription claims for antipsychotic medications were used
to define the cohort for a parent study examining diabetes
screening (16). Therefore, we were unable to examine HIV
testing of people with severe mental illness who received
services at specialty mental health facilities and who were
not taking these medications. Finally, although we were able
to explore the role that substance use plays in driving
HIV testing, this data set did not include sexual orientation,
making it impossible to evaluate subpopulations that might
most benefit from HIV testing (for example, men who have
sex with men).
CONCLUSIONS
Our findings suggest that even after three decades of efforts
to increase HIV testing in the United States, primary care
physicians and psychiatrists are in need of more compre-
hensive education about the importance of HIV testing
among persons with severe mental illness. Future research
should be conducted to evaluate patient-, provider-, and
system-level factors that might influence HIV testing. For
example, these studies could explore factors that may con-
tribute to this quality gap, such as patient refusal, stigma
around HIV testing (both at patient and provider levels), and
lack of psychiatrist education about HIV prevalence in
populations with severe mental illness. Furthermore, mental
health care teams’ practice of prioritizing psychosocial
problems over medical screening and the lack of systemic
infrastructure to facilitate HIV testing should be addressed.
Policies or practices that might exempt mental health fa-
cilities from following guidelines recommended for all
health care facilities should be discouraged. In addition, it is
important to investigate whether HIV testing is more fre-
quently ordered by psychiatrists or primary care providers.
Future studies must also focus on evidence-based efforts
to increase HIV testing and linkage to care for people with
severe mental illness. Although a recent systematic review
found equivalent adherence to HIV/AIDS treatment guide-
lines among adults with severe mental illness and the gen-
eral population, the results were limited by the paucity of
such data (22). Although we recognize that longitudinal
examination of HIV treatment among individuals with
comorbid severe mental illness and HIV has been chal-
lenging because of the segregation of mental health and gen-
eral medical care records in the public health system, we
believe that evaluating the HIV care that this population
receives—or does not receive—is another important area
for future research.
In summary, we found a highly concerning lack of HIV
testing among people with severe mental illness served in
the public specialty mental health care system. Lack of HIV
testing is a missed prevention opportunity and ultimately
increases the risk of HIV transmission and delays treatment
for those who have been infected, resulting in increased
morbidity and mortality. The high-risk population of people
with severe mental illness must be prioritized for any HIV
testing initiative. Because most people with severe mental
illness in the United States receive care in public specialty
mental health clinics (30,35), we encourage public mental
health administrators to expand their current efforts to in-
tegrate care beyond cardiovascular risk reduction to develop
multilevel interventions to improve HIV testing in their
systems of care.
