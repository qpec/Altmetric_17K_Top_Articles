IMPORTANCE Rice—a typical first food and major ingredient in various infant foods—contains
inorganic arsenic (As), but the extent of As exposure from these foods has not been well
characterized in early childhood.
OBJECTIVE To determine the types and frequency of rice and rice-containing products
consumed by infants in the first year of life and the association with As biomarker
concentrations.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Included were infants from singleton births of pregnant
women enrolled in the New Hampshire Birth Cohort Study from 2011 to 2014 whose parents
were interviewed during their first year of life. Enrolled women from selected clinics were
aged 18 to 45 years, living in the same residence since their last menstrual period, in
households served by a private water system, and had no plans to move during pregnancy.
Data on infants’intake of rice and rice products were collected from interviews with their
parents at 4, 8, and 12 months’follow-up and from a 3-day food diary at 12 months from
March 2013 to August 2014.
EXPOSURES Infants’intake of rice and rice products.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Total urinary As and the sum of As species measured using
inductively coupled mass spectrometry and high-performance liquid chromatography with
inductively coupled mass spectrometry. Commonly reported infant rice snacks were tested
for As.
RESULTS We obtained dietary data on 759 of 951 infants (79.8% participation rate). Of these,
391 infants (51.7%) were male, and the mean (SD) gestational age was 39.4 (1.7) weeks. An
estimated 80% were introduced to rice cereal during their first year. At 12 months, 32.6% of
infants (42 of 129) were fed rice snacks. Among infants aged 12 months who did not eat fish
or seafood, the geometric mean total urinary As concentrations were higher among those
who ate infant rice cereal (9.53 μg/L) or rice snacks (4.97 μg/L) compared with those who did
not eat rice or rice products (2.85 μg/L; all P < .01). Infant rice snacks contained between
36 and 568 ng/g of As and 5 to 201 ng/g of inorganic As.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Our findings indicate that intake of rice cereal and other
rice-containing foods, such as rice snacks, contribute to infants’As exposure and suggest that
efforts should be made to reduce As exposure during this critical phase of development.

A
rsenic (As) exposure from rice is of particular concern
for infants and children.1-4 Infant rice cereal, a com-
mon first food,5,6 may contain inorganic As concentra-
tions exceeding the recommendation from the Codex Alimen-
tarius Commission of the World Health Organization and the
FoodandAgricultureOrganizationoftheUnitedNationsof200
ng/g for polished (white) rice,4 the new European Union regu-
lations of 100 ng/g for products aimed at infants7 (eTable 1 in
the Supplement), and the proposed US Food and Drug Admin-
istration limit.8 Infants consuming only a few servings of rice
cereal or other products (eg, rice snacks) per day may exceed
the now-withdrawn provisional weekly tolerable intakes for
As set by the Joint Food and Agriculture Organization of the
UnitedNationsandtheWorldHealthOrganizationExpertCom-
mittee on Food Additives.9,10
Intake of rice early in childhood has not been well char-
acterized in the United States, and there are only limited data
from other regions of the world.5,6 Moreover, biomarker con-
centrations of As among infants consuming rice are virtually
unknown. An association between rice consumption and uri-
nary As would be expected based on previous studies,11-18 in-
cluding work from our group on rice consumption during
pregnancy,19 on elevated As concentrations in second- and
third-stage infant foods,20 and on toddler formulas sweet-
ened with brown rice syrup.21 Emerging epidemiologic evi-
dence suggests that As exposure in utero and during early
life may be associated with adverse health effects on fetal
growth22,23 and on infant and child immune24,25 and
neurodevelopmental26outcomes,evenattherelativelylowlev-
els of exposure common in the United States. Given the vul-
nerability of infants and young children to the effects of As
exposure,27 we investigated food-borne sources of As among
infants during the first year of life as part of a US pregnancy
cohort.
Methods
Study Participants
Our study included 951 of 984 infants (96.6%) delivered to
mothers enrolled in the New Hampshire Birth Cohort Study
from February 2011 to October 2014 who consented for the
follow-up component. Pregnant women using a private water
system, living at the same residence since their last men-
strual period, not planning to move prior to delivery, and
delivering a singleton birth were recruited from participating
prenatal clinics. Women were asked to complete a self-
administered lifestyle and medical history questionnaire that
included information about their home water supply (eg,
drilled or dug well vs spring) and use of water filters. Partici-
pants were asked to provide a home tap water sample, which
was analyzed using collision cell inductively coupled plasma
mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) as described previously.19 The
Committee for the Protection of Human Subjects at Dart-
mouth College approved this study, and all participants pro-
vided written informed consent at enrollment in accordance
with guidelines from the committee and were compensated
for their participation.
Follow-up Interviews to Ascertain Diet in All Enrolled Infants
Infants were followed up through a structured telephone in-
terview every 4 months (ie, at 4, 8, and 12 months), which in-
cluded questions about general dietary patterns (breast and
formula feeding), the timing of introduction of solid foods (in-
cluding rice cereal), and changes in water supply. At 12 months,
the interviewer asked about dietary patterns during the past
week, including whether the infant had consumed rice ce-
real, white or brown rice, or foods either made with rice (eg,
rice-based snacks such as rice cakes or puffs or dried break-
fastcerealscontainingrice)orsweetenedwithbrownricesyrup
(eg, certain brands of cereal bars).
Urine and Food Diary Collection at 12 Months
In March 2013, we began collecting urine samples along with
a 3-day food diary from the parents of infants who received
pediatric care at the 2 major clinics involved in our study. Par-
ents were asked to record the time of feedings along with the
type and amount of all foods and beverages consumed for 3
days, ending at the time the urine sample was obtained. Urine
was collected following a protocol adapted from Fängström et
al,28 with diapers and cotton pads tested for As content,29 ana-
lyzed for specific gravity using a handheld refractometer with
automatic temperature compensation (PAL-10S; ATAGO Co
Ltd), processed, and frozen at −80°C within 24 hours.
Total urinary As was measured by collision cell ICP-MS
using germanium as an internal standard.30 Arsenic species
were obtained by a high-performance liquid chromatogra-
phy GP50 pump (Dionex Corp) and a PRP100X column (Ham-
ilton Co) connected to a collision cell ICP-MS.29,31-33 Approxi-
mately 10% of samples were run in duplicate for both analyses.
The limit of detection for total urinary As was 0.05 μg/L and
was 0.078, 0.15, 0.174, and 0.15 for AsIII, AsV, monomethylar-
sonic acidV, and dimethylarsinic acidV, respectively, and the
coefficient of variation for the sum of the metabolites re-
mained less than 10%. The As speciation standard reference
materials were National Institute of Standards and Technol-
ogy 2669 (levels 1 and 2) and Institut National de Santé Pub-
lique Québec S0905, S0909, S0911, S1002, S1015, and S1017
and included 2 urine samples from the Center for Toxicology
of Quebec. Average recoveries were all within 15%.
Key Points
Question How frequently do infants consume rice and
rice-containing products, and what is their exposure to arsenic
from these foods?
Findings In this cohort study of 759 infants with dietary data, an
estimated 80% were introduced to rice cereal in the first year of
life. In a subset of 129 infants studied at 12 months of age, 55%
reported consuming rice or rice products, including rice snacks,
in the 2 days prior to urine collection, and consumption of these
products was associated with urinary arsenic concentrations in
infants.
Meaning These findings suggest that infants’consumption of rice
and rice-containing foods, typical of their diets, contribute to their
arsenic exposure and highlight the need for strategies to reduce
exposure during this critical phase of development.

Market Basket Study of Infant Rice Snacks
Rice snacks frequently reported in the infant food diaries were
purchasedfromonlinesourcesandalocalsupermarketinHan-
over, New Hampshire. Duplicate samples were obtained and
analyzed for each product. For products with As concentra-
tions of more than 300 ng/g, a different lot number sample was
purchased and tested using ICP-MS for total As and high-
performance liquid chromatography with ICP-MS for As spe-
cies. Quality control included duplicate analyses of all samples
and 1 sample spike, National Institute of Standards and Tech-
nology standard reference materials (1568b), 2 fortified blanks,
and 2 digestion blanks. Recoveries were all within the 95% CIs
of the certified value.
Statistical Analysis
We estimated the timing of the introduction of rice cereal in
the first year of life by computing the cumulative proportion
of infants who were introduced to rice cereal based on re-
sponses to the interval interviews up to 12 months. Using data
from the interviews at 12 months, we determined the propor-
tion of infants who had ingested white or brown rice as well
as foods made with rice or sweetened with brown rice syrup
in the past week.
We calculated the percentage of infants who consumed
rice-containing foods during the 2 days prior to the collection
of urine samples (based on As excretion rates34,35) in the
following categories: (1) rice (as the primary ingredient);
(2) infant rice cereal (marketed as baby, infant, or toddler/
transitionalcerealswiththeprimaryingredientasrice);(3)non-
infantricecereal(notspecificallymarketedtoinfants);(4)adult
food with rice (prepared with rice and not specifically mar-
keted to infants); (5) baby food with rice (marketed as baby
foods, toddler foods, or other transitional foods for infants and
toddlers prepared with rice as one of the ingredients); and
(6) snacks made with rice (marketed as snacks with rice as a
listed ingredient).
We evaluated associations between log10-transformed uri-
nary As concentrations at 12 months and consumption of rice
products using general linear models (GLMs), taking into ac-
count urinary dilution by including specific gravity as a co-
variate in all models.29 We used log10 transformations to lin-
earize the association between urinary As concentration and
specific gravity and to better meet model assumptions of equal
variance and normality. In humans, AsV reduces to AsIII and
metabolizes to monomethylarsonic acid and dimethylarsinic
acid with S-adenosylmethionine as the methyl donor. Arseno-
betaine is an unmetabolized form of As present in seafood and
fish. Therefore, models for total urinary As concentrations
(TUAs) were restricted to infants who had not consumed sea-
food or fish during the 3 days prior to the collection of urine
samples. We also created a model for the speciated urinary As
(SUAs), composed of the sum of the inorganic As species (AsIII
and AsV) and the metabolites of inorganic As (monomethyl-
arsonic acid and dimethylarsinic acid), excluding the 7 par-
ticipants for whom each of the urinary metabolites of interest
were below the method detection limit in at least 1 run. We ex-
amined the potential confounding effects of home tap water
As concentration and sex, but because these factors were un-
related to urinary As concentrations, we report only the mod-
els including specific gravity.
UsingGLMs,wetesteda3-levelcategoricalvariabletocom-
pare infants who consumed no rice products at all, infants who
consumed rice, and infants who consumed foods made with
rice. We then performed pairwise comparisons for consum-
ers vs nonconsumers of each of the 6 rice food categories. In-
fants who consumed multiple kinds of rice products were in-
cludedwitheachtypeoffoodconsumed.Additionally,weused
a GLM with all food items (as binary variables) entered into a
single model to evaluate the relative contributions of particu-
lar food items to log10-transformed TUAs and SUAs. Finally, we
fit a GLM to log10-SUAs and log10-TUAs as a function of the total
servings of rice products and specific gravity. Statistical sig-
nificance was assessed at P = .05.
Results
As of June 2015, interval telephone interviews regarding in-
fants’dietswerecompletedfor759of951infants(79.8%).More
detailed information on diet and total urinary As at 12 months
was available for 129 infants approached for the substudy, with
data on urinary As species available for 48 infants. The char-
acteristics of the infants were generally similar in the sub-
groups included in the analyses (Table 1).
Consumption of Rice and Rice Products During
the First Year of Life
Of the 759 infants whose parents consented to a telephone in-
terview during the infants’first year of life, an estimated 80%
of infants were introduced to rice cereal in the first year of life,
with most (64%) starting at 4 to 6 months (eFigure 1 in the
Supplement). At 12 months, 43% reported eating some type of
rice product in the past week; 13% ate white rice and 10% ate
brown rice at an average of 1 to 2 servings per week. Twenty-
four percent of infants consumed foods made with rice or
sweetened with rice syrup in the past week (eg, rice-based
snack foods, nonbaby cereals, and certain cereal bars) at an av-
erage of 5 to 6 servings per week.
Based on information recorded in the food diary 2 days
prior to the collection of urine samples, 42 of 129 infants
(32.6%) ate rice snacks (most of which were specifically re-
corded as infant or toddler snacks), 13 (10.1%) ate infant or tod-
dler foods containing rice, and 8 (6.2%) ate adult foods with
rice.Teninfants(7.8%)consumedwhiteorbrownrice,8(6.2%)
ate baby rice cereal, and 6 (4.7%) ate nonbaby rice cereal
(Figure 1A). Overall, 71 infants (55.0%) consumed some type
of rice product in the prior 2 days.
Association of Urinary Arsenic Concentration
With Rice Consumption at 12 Months
The median (range) urinary As concentrations were 4.11 μg/L
(0.36-121.42 μg/L) for TUAs, 0.24 μg/L (below detection limit,
2.90 μg/L) for inorganic As, 0.92 μg/L (below detection limit,
3.07 μg/L) for monomethylarsonic acid, 3.00 μg/L (below de-
tection limit, 16.46 μg/L) for dimethylarsinic acid, and 4.06
μg/L (1.05-19.93 μg/L) for SUAs (eTable 2 in the Supplement).

Based on the 129 urine samples at 12 months, As concentra-
tions were higher among infants who consumed rice or foods
mixedwithricecomparedwithinfantswhoatenorice(Figure2
and Figure 3). Total urinary As concentrations were twice as
high among infants who consumed white or brown rice (geo-
metric mean [GM], 5.83 μg/L; 95% CI, 4.23-8.05 μg/L) com-
pared with those who reported no rice intake (GM, 2.85 μg/L;
95% CI, 2.42-3.34 μg/L) and were intermediately elevated
among infants who consumed foods mixed with rice (GM, 4.13
μg/L; 95% CI, 3.29-5.18 μg/L). These differences were statis-
tically significant (GLM adjusted for specific gravity compar-
ing nonrice eaters with rice eaters, P = .002; with mixed rice
eaters, P = .02).
ThehighesturinaryAsconcentrationswereobservedamong

Arsenic Concentrations of Infant Snacks
Total As concentrations ranged from 36.5 to 568 ng/g in the 9
different rice-based infant snack foods reported as being con-
sumed by infants in our study, with roughly an equal distri-
bution between inorganic and methylated As species (Table 2).
Arsenic content varied between different flavors of the same
variety and brand of rice snack, with notably higher As con-
centrationsinthestrawberry-flavoredpuffedricesnacks,which
contained 40% inorganic As (brown and white rice flour were
the first 2 listed ingredients).

Discussion
Most infants in our study were exposed to rice and rice prod-
ucts during the first year of life. Rice cereal was introduced to
most infants during weaning, and over half were reportedly
consuming at least 1 rice product at 12 months. Infants who
consumed rice and rice products, including infant rice cereal,
had higher urinary As concentrations than those who did not
consume any type of rice, with a trend of increasing urinary
As concentrations with increasing number of servings of rice
and rice products. Moreover, rice snacks marketed to infants
and toddlers were reported for nearly one-third of our sample,
and some of these products contained inorganic As above the
100 ng/g European Union standard for inorganic As in prod-
ucts geared toward infants.

Arsenic exposure through food, particularly rice and rice
products, is a growing concern.2,3,9,11,20,21,36,37 Rice (Oryza
sativa L.) appears to accumulate As more than other cereal
crops,38,39 especially when grown in flooded paddies.40 Both
the total concentration of As and the proportion of inorganic
As present in commercial rice vary widely owing to differ-
encesinricecultivarsandgeographicallocations.41-43Ricefrom
the United States has higher total As concentrations reported
than rice from other countries,44,45 but no statutory limits for
As exist for rice sold in the United States.
Limited information is available on the timing of the intro-
ductionofricecerealortheprevalenceofrice-productconsump-
tionamongUSinfants.Inacohortstudy46of1560childrenfrom
Denver, Colorado, 87% of infants at high risk for celiac disease

was far more prevalent in our study, perhaps reflecting tempo-
ral differences or incomplete ascertainment of rice-containing
products in the 2002 survey.
Urinary As concentrations in our infants were an order of
magnitude lower than the median 35 μg/L of As in a Bangla-
deshipopulationexposedtohighdrinkingwaterAslevels(me-
dian, 80 μg/L).28,47 This was expected given the high rate of
breastfeeding in our populations29 and the lower proportion
of households with tap water As concentrations above the US
Environmental Protection Agency standard of 10 μg/L (12.5%
inourstudy).Thus,ourstudyrepresentsapopulationforwhich
diet is likely the main source of As exposure. While we are un-
aware of any prior studies relating As biomarker concentra-
tions to rice intake among infants, associations have been ob-
served in pregnant women in our cohort,19 children in the
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey,16,18 and
multiple studies of adults.11-15
Arsenicconcentrationsinrice-basedsnackswetestedwere
intherangereportedinpreviousstudies(eTable1intheSupple-
ment), with the exception of 1 product having a total As con-
centration averaging close to 600 ng/g. Two puffed grain rice
snacks were tested by the US Food and Drug Administration;
the banana flavor had a total As concentration of 109 ng/g (46
ng/g inorganic), and the blueberry flavor was below the limit
of quantitation of 3 ng/g.45 In the study by Signes-Pastor et al,10
As concentrations in 97 rice crackers from 15 different brands
ranged from 19 to 246 ng/g, with inorganic As ranging from 19
to 212 ng/g.
There are limitations to our study. Our population from
northern New England using private, unregulated water sys-
tems may not represent the diets of populations elsewhere.
Thismayaffectthegeneralizabilityofourresults,butwewould
not expect comparisons of rice intake and urinary As to have
been biased. The lack of association with certain rice prod-
ucts could have been because of limited statistical power or
variability of As content within products. Moreover, other di-
etary sources of As, such as apple juice, may be further con-
tributing to urinary As concentrations. In our study, dietary in-
take relied on self-report, but this approach tends to produce
an accurate representation of actual diet.48
Conclusions
Arsenic found in rice and rice products can be either in the in-
organic or organic form, whereas virtually all drinking water
As is inorganic. The toxic effects of inorganic As are clear, and
laboratory evidence suggest that organic forms also may pose
a health risk,32 although further data are needed. The

European Food Safety Authority Panel3 estimated that chil-
dren younger than 3 years consume 2 to 3 times the amount
of inorganic As from food than adults per kilograms of body
weight. In addition to being more highly exposed to As, chil-
dren appear to be far more sensitive to the potential carcino-
genic effects of As49,50 and have a heightened risk for adverse
growth, adverse immune response, and adverse neurodevel-
opmental outcomes,25,51-53 even at relatively low levels of
exposure.24,54 Our results indicate that consumption of rice
and rice products increases infants’exposure to As and that
regulation could reduce As exposure during this critical phase
of development.
