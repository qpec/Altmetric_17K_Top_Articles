Chemoprophylaxis is currently the best available prevention from malaria, but its efficacy is
compromised by non-adherence to medication. Here we develop a long-acting injectable
formulation of atovaquone solid drug nanoparticles that confers long-lived prophylaxis
against Plasmodium berghei ANKA malaria in C57BL/6 mice. Protection is obtained at plasma
concentrations above 200 ng ml-1 and is causal, attributable to drug activity against liver
stage parasites. Parasites that appear after subtherapeutic doses remain atovaquone-
sensitive. Pharmacokinetic–pharmacodynamic analysis indicates protection can translate to
humans at clinically achievable and safe drug concentrations, potentially offering protection
for at least 1 month after a single administration. These findings support the use of long-
acting injectable formulations as a new approach for malaria prophylaxis in travellers and for
malaria control in the field.

very year, Plasmodium falciparum malaria afflicts hundreds
of millions of people and kills hundreds of thousands of
children1. Despite considerable success in reducing the
worldwide prevalence of malaria, its incidence in visitors to
endemic areas has continued to rise steadily2, 3, and for unpro-
tected travellers to west Africa the risk of malaria is 3.4% mo−1 4.
Though promising advances are being made, as of yet no malaria
vaccine can reliably impart high levels of long-lived protection.
Antimalarial drugs thus continue to provide an essential com-
ponent of malaria prophylaxis. Unfortunately, however, the
requirement for daily or weekly oral drug-dosing regimens is
commonly associated with noncompliance2, 3.
Human infection with falciparum malaria begins with spor-
ozoite inoculation by a female anopheline mosquito. This parasite
form migrates rapidly to the liver, invades hepatocytes and
amplifies ~20,000-fold, then spills into the bloodstream to initiate
the self-propagating 48 h erythrocytic cycle responsible for all
disease manifestations (Fig. 1). Most antimalarial drugs target
erythrocytic parasites, but several are effective against liver stages.
To preclude resistance, ill patients (who may harbour up to 1012
infected red cells) are treated with drug combinations. However,
in the numerically advantageous situation of malaria prophylaxis,
where drug concentrations are well established before the intro-
duction of a small number of parasites, monoprophylaxis (e.g.,
with mefloquine or doxycycline) is a common and highly effective
option4.
Atovaquone (Fig. 2a), a structural mimic of ubiquinone,
selectively binds to the cytochrome b of malaria parasites, inhibits
respiration and collapses the trans-mitochondrial membrane
potential5, 6. A broad-spectrum antiprotozoal, for 25 years orally
dosed atovaquone has been used for the prophylaxis and treat-
ment of Pneumocystis pneumonia in immunosuppressed patients.
In this setting, its approved dosing to obtain sustained and high
target plasma concentrations (above 20 µg mL−1, 54 µM)7 is safe
and well tolerated5. Atovaquone is not metabolised, exhibits few
drug–drug interactions, and has a plasma half-life measurable in
days. It has potent sub-nanomolar activity against erythrocytic
P. falciparum in vitro, is not cross-resistant with other anti-
malarials, and has activity against both liver stage (causal) and
erythrocytic (suppressive) parasites. A causal mechanism of
prophylaxis has several distinct advantages, including the fact that
it targets a smaller number of parasites (before they complete a
four log amplification in liver) and clinically that it requires just 1,
not 4, weeks of postexposure dosing. To preclude resistance in
patients with established erythrocytic infection, atovaquone was
marketed in fixed combination with proguanil. However, recent
studies have indicated that atovaquone-resistant P. falciparum
cannot survive in, or be transmitted by, mosquitoes8. This
remarkable phenomenon would not affect the risk of resistance in
atovaquone monotherapy of established erythrocytic parasitemia,
but it does avoid the problem of monoprophylaxis failure stem-
ming from mosquito-borne transmission of atovaquone-resistant
parasites.
Most approaches for making nanoparticle formulations involve
creating either drug-associated nanocarriers (drug conjugation,
complex-formation or encapsulation)9, 10 or excipient-stabilised
nanoparticles of drug (solid drug nanoparticles; SDNs)11–13,
using attrition methods such as nanomilling or high-pressure
homogenisation. A major limitation of both approaches is the low
ratio of drug to non-therapeutic excipients that can be attained
(commonly ≤25% dry weight). Emulsion-templated freeze drying
(ETFD)14, 15 is an alternative method for creating SDNs that
entails the use of inactive commercial excipients commonly used
in FDA-approved medicines, and allows very high-drug loadings
relative to excipients (often ≥70% by weight). Orally administered
high-drug content SDN formulations, initially identified through
ETFD screening and latterly scaled using emulsion spray drying
under good manufacturing practices conditions, are now in
clinical trials for antiretroviral indications16, 17. The approach has
also been employed to determine how physical characteristics
impact biological performance by screening nanoformulation
libraries18, 19. Nano-milled antiretroviral drugs have recently
received considerable attention after clinical trials of LAI (long-
acting injectable) medicines demonstrated therapeutic plasma
drug exposure for between 1 and 3 months, offering treatment
simplification
and
addressing
medication
adherence20–22.
Importantly, these formulations have also shown remarkable
preclinical utility for pre-exposure prophylaxis for which they are
now in clinical trials, validating the LAI approach for prophylaxis.
The marked hydrophobicity of atovaquone (log P = 4.7) and its
low systemic clearance make it particularly suitable for LAI.
Moreover, the high-drug content of ETFD-generated formula-
tions minimises the required injection volume and its associated
intolerability.
Here, using the stringent P. berghei ANKA-C57BL/6 mouse
model for malaria, we have found that intramuscular atovaquone

 nanoformulation provides reliable chemoprophylaxis, for up to
4 weeks after dosing, against an intravenous sporozoite challenge.
Pharmacokinetic–pharmacodynamic analyses indicate that pro-
tection is obtained at plasma atovaquone levels well below those
currently in clinical use for other indications, and that protection
is attributable to causal action against liver stage parasites.
Results
Preparation and characterisation of nanoparticle library. A
library of SDNs, containing atovaquone and a binary combina-
tion of polymer and surfactant excipient stabilisers, was created
using the recently reported rapid ETFD-screening approach16.
Seven candidate polymers and six surfactants were chosen from
the FDA CDER list of inactive ingredients23 and the resulting 42
formulations, all 80 wt% atovaquone, 13 wt% polymer and 7 wt%
surfactant, were assessed by dynamic light scattering (Fig. 2b).
Candidate formulations were chosen for progression if the fol-
lowing criteria were met: (1) complete aqueous dispersion at 0.5
mg mL−1; (2) SDN Z-average diameter <1000 nm to match
existing LAI paradigms; (3) dynamic light-scattering analysis
<5% SD (three scans) within the measured Z-average diameter
indicating stability during analysis; and (4) a measured poly-
dispersity index <0.4 to maximise uniformity of drug release
from injected SDNs. All 42 candidates were ranked against these
criteria and eleven (Supplementary Table 1) were identified that
also passed the reproducibility screening in subsequent repeated
syntheses (Supplementary Fig. 1). SDN zeta potentials for the
eleven candidates ranged from +8 to −20 mV (Supplementary
Table 1), indicating that stability of the dispersed samples in
water was predominantly correlated to steric stabilisation derived
from the water-soluble excipients. 3H-atovaquone utilised in a

Atovaquone release from SDN formulation candidates. The 11
SDN candidates were studied by in vitro rapid equilibration
dialysis. Each SDN was dispersed into simulated interstitial fluid
(SIF) and compared with unformulated atovaquone (<1%
dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) in SIF). Scintillation counting
allowed rapid determination of drug release, and five candidates
(ATQSDN2, 4, 6, 7, 8) providing a 50-fold range of drug-release
rates (Fig. 2c) were progressed to in vivo testing. High-drug
content minimises depot volume but may also negatively impact
the desired release rate. Therefore, SDN formulations were gen-
erated for ATQSDN4, ATQSDN6 and ATQSDN8 (that exhibited
highest, lowest and intermediate release rate in initial screens,
respectively) using the same procedures and excipient mixtures,
to establish the effect on release rate of systematic lowering of the
drug loading from 80 wt% through to 20 wt% (Supplementary
Table 2, and Supplementary Figs. 2–5). For all three formulations,
a decrease in release rate was observed as drug content increased
to 60 wt%. Although this trend was continued to 80 wt% for
ATQSDN6 and ATQSDN8 ATQ. A higher release rate for ATQSDN4
was observed at 80 wt% drug loading. These data highlight a
critical need to determine release kinetics at different drug
loadings for LAI.

 P. falciparum24. Infection in this system is lethal, and parasitemia
reliably results from inoculation of just 50 sporozoites. However,
there are notable differences between falciparum and berghei,
including the shorter development times for P. berghei in liver
(48 h vs 6.5 d) and erythrocytes (24 vs 48 h). In our hands over
14 months’ time, in experiments involving some 320 mice, an
intravenous challenge of 5000 sporozoites was lethal in every
untreated animal, and the liver stage was confirmed to require
≥45 and ≤48. In all animals that developed patent malaria
(regardless of treatment), parasites appeared 5.5 ± 3.0 days (M ±
SD, 177 mice) after sporozoite challenge. The longest prepatent
period was 21 days (in an animal last tested on day 11), and the
interval between patency and death was 6.9 ± 3.5 days (177 mice).
To assess prophylactic activity, mice were injected once with
atovaquone, challenged once with sporozoites, and then mon-
itored 42 days for patent erythrocytic parasitemia (Fig. 3a). The
conservative 6-week follow-up interval more than eclipsed the
21 days longest prepatent period that we saw. Prophylaxis was
deemed successful only if no animal in a dosing cohort became
parasitemic by 42 days after challenge, in two independent
experiments. Experiments included untreated controls to validate
the challenge, and mice treated with the same dose of atovaquone
given orally.
In a preliminary survey, all five candidate nanoformulations
afforded some protection when injected 1 day before challenge,
but only ATQSDN7 and ATQSDN8 were fully protective against
sporozoite infusion at 7 days after dosing, so these formulations
were taken forward for further testing. Mice injected with 36, 100
or 200 mg kg−1 ATQSDN7 were challenged at intervals up to
6 weeks after dosing (Fig. 3b). For ATQSDN7 or ATQSDN8,
the efficacy (and statistical analyses) were the same: protection for
up to four weeks after challenge. In these experiments, oral
atovaquone at doses up to 200 mg kg−1 failed to protect against
challenge at ≤7 days after dosing, as did intramuscular polymer
plus surfactant (nanoformulation 'vehicles') at concentrations
equivalent to those in a 200 mg kg−1 dose of ATQSDN7 or
ATQSDN8.
Causal vs suppressive prophylaxis. To determine whether the
observed prophylaxis was causal (targeting the liver stage), sup-
pressive (acting on erythrocytic stages) or both, paired challenges
with sporozoite or erythrocytic parasites, separated by 48 h, were
conducted at intervals after dosing in cohorts of three mice
(Fig. 4). The erythrocytic challenge was devised to provide a
bloodstream parasitemia comparable to that seen 48 h after a
5000 sporozoite inoculation.
ATQSDN7 protected against all
sporozoite challenges but failed against all challenges by ery-
throcytic forms. Although a suppressive contribution may be
operative after sporozoite challenge, ATQSDN7 clearly provided
substantial causal activity.

 ATQSDN7 (Fig. 5a) or ATQSDN8 (Supplementary Fig. 6a) and
levels were dose-proportional (insert, Fig. 5a). Moreover, plasma
atovaquone concentrations >200 ng mL−1 at the time of challenge
were associated with efficacy of prophylaxis (Fig. 5b and Sup-
plementary Fig. 6b). Importantly, the 105 h plasma half-life seen
after day 4 was substantially longer than the 9 h seen after orally
dosed atovaquone in mice25, indicative of ongoing slow release
from the depot in muscle. This is consistent with observations in
humans for other LAI formulations such as rilpivirine and
cabotegravir, which also exhibit a longer plasma half-life than that
of their oral counterparts. The mechanisms underpinning depot
release are currently poorly understood but were recently
reviewed26.
Atovaquone resistance testing. To evaluate whether atovaquone
resistance contributes to failure after sporozoite challenge, we
evaluated the atovaquone sensitivity of parasites that appeared
after inadequate prophylaxis (Fig. 6). Mice were challenged
2 weeks after 36 mg kg−1 ATQSDN7, a dose and interval combi-
nation expected to fail (Fig. 3b). Erythrocytic parasites appeared,
and were subinoculated into naive mice that were then treated
with oral atovaquone at the lowest curative dose (Methods).
Positive controls infected with atovaquone-resistant P. berghei
became parasitemic by 2 days after oral therapy. Negative con-
trols infected with parasites not exposed to prophylaxis were
cured. Mice infected with blood from prophylaxis failures were
also
cured,
indicating
these
parasites
remain
atovaquone-
sensitive.
Discussion
Despite promising advances toward a malaria vaccine, chemo-
prophylaxis remains the mainstay for malaria prevention. A safe
and effective long-acting intramuscular drug-dosing preparation
would provide a new tool, which joins the high efficacy of che-
motherapy with the durability and ease of adherence more
characteristic of a vaccine. These are, to our knowledge, the first
studies of a long-acting slow-release nanoformulation of drug for
causal malaria prophylaxis. They provide a convincing rationale
for further exploring this strategy, and pharmacokinetic criteria
for proof-of-concept clinical trial.
In the lethal P. berghei ANKA-C57BL/6 mouse model of
malaria, ATQSDN7 or ATQSDN8 provided complete protection
against a large sporozoite challenge for up to 4 weeks after a single
intramuscular dose (Fig. 3b). The duration of prophylaxis was
dose-dependent, and comparison of plasma atovaquone levels at
the time of challenge demarcates 200 ng mL−1 as a reasonable
threshold for efficacy (Fig. 5b). This benchmark is in close
agreement with data from P. falciparum sporozoite challenge
studies
in
non-immune
healthy
volunteers,
in
which
≥200 ng mL−1 atovaquone at the time of challenge was at least
96% protective in 24 subjects27, 28. (The single failure was thought
due to an assay error that led investigators to 'question whether
this volunteer truly had malaria'28.) Since the half-life after oral
dosing of atovaquone in humans is allometrically eight times
slower than that in mice (70 vs 9 h)25, 27, the duration of
prophylaxis afforded by a 200 mg kg−1 slow-release depot in
humans will almost certainly extend beyond the 28 days obtained
in mice, at a concentration-time exposure well within the chronic
>20 µg mL−1 required in patients for Pneumocystis pneumonia or
toxoplasmosis.
Unusual among antimalarials, atovaquone has activity against
primary liver stages as well as erythrocytic parasites (causal and
suppressive, respectively). When a pretreated animal is challenged
with sporozoites, atovaquone thus has two opportunities against
the parasite: during the initial liver stage and again during the
subsequent asexual erythrocytic cycle. We were intrigued to find
that in the P. berghei ANKA-C57BL/6 model, efficacy against
sporozoite challenge is attributable largely, if not entirely, to
action against hepatic forms (Fig. 4). Atovaquone levels effica-
cious against sporozoite challenge did not protect mice challenged
with erythrocytic parasites. Though comparable relevant data in
humans are limited, plasma levels substantially higher than 200
ng mL−1 are required for activity against established erythrocytic
infection29, 30. Furthermore, in sporozoite challenge studies,
human subjects prophylaxed with atovaquone have no evidence
of ever having developed an erythrocytic infection, by exquisitely
sensitive PCR methods or blood culture27, 28, 31. Many factors
could account for this apparent differential effect of atovaquone,
including, for example, an intrinsically greater susceptibility of
hepatic forms, drug accumulation in liver, or both.
Given the propensity for erythrocytic parasites to develop
cytochrome b mutations that impart drug resistance6, 30, we
evaluated the atovaquone sensitivity of parasites that survived a
36 mg kg−1 low prophylactic dose, when challenge was 2 weeks
after injection (Fig. 6). These parasites (like their untreated
controls) remained drug sensitive when subinoculated into naive

 mice. This finding, in conjunction with a <120 ng mL−1 sub-
therapeutic plasma atovaquone concentration at the time of
challenge, indicates therapeutic failure rather than drug resistance.
At all dose levels we studied, parasitemia after intramuscular
atovaquone nanoformulation was associated with plasma con-
centrations below 200 ng mL−1 by the time of sporozoite chal-
lenge, consistent with a simple therapeutic breakpoint (Fig. 5b).
Although a substantial body of preclinical and clinical evidence
is already available for orally dosed atovaquone, progression of
this work toward clinical trial will require careful preclinical
toxicity testing, especially with respect to the injection site. Our
studies suggest that atovaquone alone may be suitable for malaria
prophylaxis in non-immune travellers, but the obtained plasma
levels and propensity for engendering resistance would proscribe
its use in patients with established erythrocytic infection. Limited
clinical information indicates that atovaquone may also have
causal activity against vivax malaria32, but like orally dosed ato-
vaquone/proguanil, mefloquine or doxycycline, it would not be
expected to preclude the establishment of latent hypnozoites.
Atovaquone long-acting injectable nanoformulations combine
a safe, extensively studied, clinically used drug with excipients
utilised in other FDA-approved medicines. Our findings suggest
that a single intramuscular dose of nanoformulated atovaquone
may provide causal prophylaxis against falciparum malaria for an
extended period of time. This is a potential option for non-
immune people travelling to malarious areas, whose trips typi-
cally last 4 weeks or less33, and if carefully deployed it may also
provide an intervention in malaria control efforts.

µL water, to provide a solid mass ratio of 80% atovaquone:13% polymer:7%
surfactant in an 1:4 oil:water mix. Mixtures were emulsified with a Covaris S2x for
30 s with a duty cycle of 20, intensity of 10 and 500 cycles/burst in frequency
sweeping mode, after which samples were immediately cryogenically frozen. A
matrix of 42 samples was prepared and lyophilised (Virtis benchtop K) for 42 h to
leave a dry porous product. The samples were sealed in individual vials until
analysis. 3H-atovaquone was added to the chloroform stock solution to generate
radioactive nanoparticles of atovaquone.
For half-scale preparations, stock solutions were added at the following
proportions: 50 µL atovaquone; 31.85 µL polymer, 15.75 µL surfactant, with 152.4
µL water. These were processed the same as the full scale preparations to give the
same freeze-dried monoliths. For rapid equilibrium dialysis release rate studies,
samples were prepared incorporating 3H-atovaquone at 0.2 µCi mg−1 activity.
Physical characterisation of ATQSDN library. Immediately prior to analysis,
samples were dispersed by addition of 16 mL of water. The Z-average diameter
(nm) dispersed SDNs was measured, in triplicate, by dynamic light scattering
(Malvern Zetasizer Nano ZS), using automatic measurement optimisation and
Malvern Zetasizer software version 7.11 for data analysis. Eleven initial hits passed
the selection criteria and demonstrated reproducibility between repeated synthesis
and between full- and half-scale preparations (Supplementary Fig. 1).
In vitro evaluation of atovaquone release rates. The 11 candidates from physical
characterisation were progressed to in vitro release kinetics using a rapid equili-
brium dialysis model of an intramuscular depot. SDN samples were dispersed and
diluted to 1 mg mL−1 atovaquone in SIF, consisting of 35 mg mL−1 bovine serum
albumin (Sigma-Aldrich), 2 mg mL−1 bovine γ-globulin (Sigma-Aldrich) dissolved
in distilled water. Unformulated atovaquone was dissolved in DMSO prior to
dilution with SIF, such that DMSO comprised <1% of final volume. To assess
release, 0.5 mL samples were added to the donor compartment of an 8 kDa MWCO
rapid equilibrium dialysis insert (ThermoFisher Scientific) and 1 mL SIF was added
to the acceptor compartment. Plates containing the inserts were placed on an
orbital shaker (Heidolph Rotomax 120; 100 rpm, 6 h, 37 °C) and at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
and 6 h, acceptor fluid (0.5 mL) was removed and replaced with fresh pre-warmed
SIF. Three separate dialyses were conducted for each formulation. Aliquots (0.1
mL) of the timed samples were added to 4 mL scintillation cocktail fluid (Ultima
Gold, Meridian Biotechnologies, UK) and DPM were determined (Perkin Elmer
3100TS). Data are expressed as the amount of atovaquone released and diffused
across the membrane, as percent of the starting donor amount, or as a first-order
release rate constant (k) calculated from the final sample.
Dosing materials. Dosing materials were prepared within 2 h of use and mixed
thoroughly immediately prior to each injection. Nanoformulations were con-
stituted in sterile deionized water. For oral administration, Mepron in foil sachets
(GSK; Johns Hopkins Hospital pharmacy) was diluted with 10% poloxamer 188
(P5556, Sigma-Aldrich). Animals were fasted overnight prior to and 4 h after
dosing.
Ethical statement. All animal studies were conducted under Johns Hopkins
University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee-approved protocols.
Sporozoites and blood stage parasites for challenge. For sporozoite challenge,
4–6 day-old female Anopheles stephensi mosquitoes (Liston strain) reared in the
Johns Hopkins Malaria Research Institute Insectary were fasted for 6 h then fed on
6–8 week-old female Swiss Webster mice (Envigo) infected with P. berghei ANKA
2.34 strain (ATCC). Fed mosquitoes were maintained for 18 days (19 °C, 80%

Fig. 6 Experimental scheme and results of resistance testing. Mice treated with 36 mg kg−1 ATQSDN7 (n = 6) or no drug (n = 2) were challenged with P.
berghei ANKA sporozoites. Erythrocytic parasites appeared in both cohorts, and were harvested and subinoculated into naive mice. At the same time a
third cohort of naive mice was infected with atovaquone-resistant parasites, to serve as positive controls (n = 2). All animals were then treated orally once
daily for 3 sequential days with 10 mg kg−1 atovaquone, and monitored for parasitemia. Mice infected with parasites from the ATQSDN7 prophylaxis failures,
or from the no prophylaxis controls, remained parasite-free for 30 days after oral treatment (green bars). Mice infected with atovaquone-resistant P.
berghei became parasitemic by 2 days after oral treatment and died (pink bars)

 relative humidity), when salivary glands were harvested into RPMI medium and
disrupted by several passages through a 0.5 in, 28-gauge needle to release spor-
ozoites. Parasites were counted by hemocytometer and diluted to 25,000 mL−1 RPMI.
For blood stage challenge, donor mice (6-week-old C57BL/6 male mice, Jackson
Laboratory) were infected by tail vein infusion of 5000 P. berghei ANKA sporozoites,
and at ≥0.5% parasitemia were anaesthetised (intraperitoneal 100 mg kg-1 ketamine,
5 mg kg-1 acepromazine). Blood was harvested by cardiac puncture and diluted with
RPMI to obtain 1.5 × 105 infected erythrocytes per 200 uL.
In vivo efficacy and pharmacokinetics. All studies were conducted with P. ber-
ghei (ANKA 2.34 strain) in 6-week-old C57BL/6 male mice (Jackson Laboratory).
Animals were dosed just once and challenged just once. Mice (~20 g) were injected
intramuscularly (biceps femoris; 27-gauge needle, 100 µL Hamilton syringe, part
number 7656–01) with the test nanoformulation or vehicle (20 µL per limb, 40 µL
total volume). Oral atovaquone was administered by gavage. At predetermined
intervals after dosing, mice were challenged by tail vein infusion of 5000 spor-
ozoites, or 1.5 × 105 infected erythrocytes, in 200 µL RPMI. Starting 4 days after
challenge then weekly thereafter for 42 days, tail snip blood samples were examined
for parasites via Giemsa-stained thin smears. A sample was deemed negative if no
parasites were seen in 2000 erythrocytes (limit of detection, 0.05% parasitemia).
Animals were monitored daily for overall morbidity and mortality. Each experi-
ment had a vehicle control to validate challenges. The efficacy outcome was binary:
protected or failed. Treatment was deemed protective if all animals in at least two
independent experiments remained parasite-free at 42 days post challenge.
Any partial protection (e.g., delayed parasitemia or just one unprotected mouse in a
cohort) was nevertheless deemed a failure. Blood for pharmacokinetics was har-
vested (microtainer tubes, BD Biosciences), centrifuged (1300×g, 10 min, 4 °C), and
plasma was collected and stored at −80 °C until use.
Generation of atovaquone-resistant erythrocytic P. berghei. Six-week-old
C57BL/6 male mice (Jackson Laboratory) were inoculated intraperitoneally with
150,000 infected erythrocytes, and at ~3% parasitemia cohorts of 3–6 mice were
treated daily for 3 days with oral doses of 1, 10, 100, or 1000 mg kg−1 atovaquone.
Mice in the 10, 100 and 1000 mg kg−1 groups remained parasite-free at 30 days post
infection, and 10 mg kg−1 was designated the lowest curative dose. Mice treated
with three daily doses of 1 mg kg−1 recrudesced 9 days after the final dose and were
then given a single oral dose of 10 mg kg−1 atovaquone. Parasitemia fell transiently
then began increasing on day 3, when blood was harvested, pooled, and 106
parasitized cells per animal were subinoculated into naive mice. Cohorts of two
subinoculated mice were treated daily for 3 days with oral doses of 1, 10, or 100 mg
kg-1 atovaquone. All animals recrudesced. On day 8 blood from mice that failed
100 mg kg−1 was harvested, pooled, diluted 1:1 in Alsever’s solution with 10%
glycerol, stored at −80 °C, and used as the resistance reference line.
Atovaquone sensitivity of parasites from animals that failed prophylaxis. Six-
week-old C57BL/6 male mice (Jackson Laboratory) dosed on study day 0 with 36
mg kg−1 intramuscular ATQSDN7 (n = 6) or no drug (n = 2) were challenged on day
14 with 5000 sporozoites. On day 19 blood was harvested from parasitemic animals
in the treated (n = 3) or placebo groups (n = 2), pooled accordingly, diluted with
phosphate buffered saline, and subinoculated intraperitoneally into naive mice at
106 parasites per mouse (three treated, two control). For a positive control, naive
mice (n = 2) were inoculated intraperitoneally with 106 atovaquone-resistant ery-
throcytic parasites (above). All subinoculated mice were treated once daily on study
days 20, 21 and 22, with an oral dose of 10 mg kg−1 atovaquone, the lowest curative
regimen (above), then monitored 30 days for parasitemia.
Atovaquone concentration in plasma. Atovaquone concentration in plasma was
determined by UPLC-MS/MS, using a modification of a previously described
method that was validated to FDA standards34. In brief, acetonitrile and deuterated
atovaquone internal standard (Toronto Research Chemicals) were added to 25 µL
thawed plasma, followed by vortex mixing and centrifugation to obtain the
supernatant. A 10 µL aliquot was separated by linear gradient on 50 × 2 mm, 2.5 µm
Polar-RP 100 A column (Synergi), and atovaquone was monitored by triple-
quadrupole API 4000 mass analyser with electrospray ionisation (SCIEX, Fra-
mingham, MA, USA). The assay was validated for 5–5000 ng mL−1 and inter-
polations were by 1/x2-weighted least-squares-fitted quadratic regression. All 77
reported values were determined by this method. A subset of 42 samples, analysed
in another laboratory by the previous method34, agreed within 15%.
Statistical analyses. Descriptive values in the text are M ± SD. Plasma half-life
was estimated by linear regression of log concentration on time in a sparse sam-
pling non-compartmental analysis using Phoenix WinNonlin 8.0 (Certara, Prin-
ceton, NJ, USA). Fisher’s exact test was used to compare the pooled proportions of
untreated mice and mice treated with successful regimens (for each dose-to-
challenge interval), using Stata 14.0 (StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA).
