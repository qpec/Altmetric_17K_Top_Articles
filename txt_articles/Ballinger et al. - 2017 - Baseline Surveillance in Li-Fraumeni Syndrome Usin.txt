IMPORTANCE Guidelines for clinical management in Li-Fraumeni syndrome, a multiple-organ
cancer predisposition condition, are limited. Whole-body magnetic resonance imaging
(WBMRI) may play a role in surveillance of this high-risk population.
OBJECTIVE To assess the clinical utility of WBMRI in germline TP53 mutation carriers at
baseline.
DATA SOURCES Clinical and research surveillance cohorts were identified through the
Li-Fraumeni Exploration Research Consortium.
STUDY SELECTION Cohorts that incorporated WBMRI for individuals with germline TP53
mutations from January 1, 2004, through October 1, 2016, were included.
DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Data were extracted by investigators from each cohort
independently and synthesized by 2 investigators. Random-effects meta-analysis methods
were used to estimate proportions.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The proportions of participants at baseline in whom a lesion
was detected that required follow-up and in whom a new primary malignant neoplasm was
detected.
RESULTS A total of 578 participants (376 female [65.1%] and 202 male [34.9%]; mean [SD]
age, 33.2 [17.1] years) from 13 cohorts in 6 countries were included in the analysis. Two
hundred twenty-five lesions requiring clinical follow-up were detected by WBMRI in 173
participants. Sixty-one lesions were diagnosed in 54 individuals as benign or malignant
neoplasms. Overall, 42 cancers were identified in 39 individuals, with 35 new localized
cancers treated with curative intent. The overall estimated detection rate for new, localized
primary cancers was 7% (95% CI, 5%-9%).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE These data suggest clinical utility of baseline WBMRI in TP53
germline mutation carriers and may form an integral part of baseline clinical risk management
in this high-risk population.

i-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) was first described in 1969
as a highly penetrant cancer-prone syndrome.1 Formal
diagnostic criteria for LFS have subsequently been de-
veloped,basedonafamilyorapersonalhistoryofabroadspec-
trum of early-onset cancers, including sarcoma, breast can-
cer, adrenocortical carcinoma, and brain tumors, often with
more than 1 cancer per affected individual.2-5 Lifetime cancer
risks are reported to approach 100% for both sexes in cases
identifiedbyfamilyhistory.6-8Theexceedinglyhighcancerrisk
inLFSoftenconfersahighpsychologicalandmedicalburden.9
Pathogenic variants in the tumor suppressor gene, TP53 (NCBI
EntrezGene7157),werefirstidentifiedandsubsequentlyfound
to cause about 70% of classic LFS in 1990.10-13 Identification
of germline TP53 mutation carriers has been augmented by in-
creased with increased sequencing of germline and somatic
DNA using gene panels and whole-exome and whole-
genome testing, owing in part to the influence of precision
medicine initiatives.
Although the clinical characteristics and molecular basis
for LFS have been known for decades, no universally ac-
cepted approach exists for risk management. Current guide-
lines focus on the risk for breast cancer, primarily because or-
gan-specific surveillance measures,14-16 such as magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) of the breast, are already widely used
for screening in cognate high-risk syndromes. However, be-
cause breast cancer constitutes only a proportion of the sur-
gically resectable cancers to which TP53 mutation carriers are
prone, novel, effective methods for cancer surveillance are
needed across a broad range of body or corporeal sites. Within
the past 5 years, emerging studies have suggested improved
clinical outcomes for TP53 mutation carriers with intensive
screening.17-20 The Toronto protocol, which incorporates
whole-body MRI (WBMRI) among other modalities, was as-
sociated with improved survival.17 Neonatal screening for the
Brazilian TP53 founder mutation resulted in adrenocortical tu-
mors being detected at an early, more curable stage.18 Of note,
arecentUKstudydetectedmalignantneoplasmsin14%ofTP53
mutation carriers at baseline WBMRI.19 Psychological benefit
has also been reported from participation in an LFS surveil-
lance program.20 However, in part because of the rarity of LFS,
definitive evidence of the benefits of screening are lacking.
To generate evidence for the efficacy of WBMRI as a sur-
veillance tool for carriers of pathogenic germline TP53 muta-
tions,wereporthereinthefindingsofameta-analysisof13pro-
spective cohorts conducted in 6 countries. We assessed the
detection rates of asymptomatic cancers using WBMRI as part
of baseline assessment of TP53 mutation carriers, measured
by the rate of identification of investigable lesions and new pri-
mary cancers that can be treated with curative intent.
Methods
Study Selection
Clinicalandresearchsurveillancecohortswereidentifiedthrough
theLi-FraumeniExplorationResearchConsortium.21Cohortsthat
wereformedfromJanuary1,2004,throughOctober1,2016,that
performed WBMRI in individuals at any age were considered
(eTable1intheSupplement).Allresearchcohortshadethicalap-
proval from their ethics boards, and written informed consent
was obtained from participants or guardians as appropriate.
Participants were not required to be newly diagnosed for
any of the studies included in this meta-analysis. All cohorts
included the brain in the WBMRI scan except the Huntsman
Cancer Institute cohort. All participants were asymptomatic
at the time of the baseline scan. The details of imaging proto-
cols for contributing cohorts, including the use of contrast and
organ-specific sequences, are given in eTables 2 to 14 in the
Supplement. All participants were known carriers of patho-
genic TP53 mutations or were obligate carriers by pedigree.
Data Extraction and Classification
Datawereextractedbyinvestigatorsfromeachcohortandsyn-
thesizedby2ofus(M.L.B.andD.M.T.).Lesionswereconsidered
to be investigable if further clinical follow-up was required in
the opinion of the study investigator, including additional
imagingorbiopsy.Thetrue-positiverateforWBMRIwasdefined
as the rate of detection of localized, primary cancers that were
treatedwithcurativeintent.False-positivelesionsweredefined
as those considered initially to be neoplastic (all neoplasms in
the Figure) but that subsequently were determined on further
investigationtobebenigntumors,recurrencesofpreviouscan-
cers, or incurable metastatic cancers. Low-grade gliomas were
classified as malignant. The treatment intent (curative or pal-
liative) after diagnosis was recorded in each case.
Statistical Analysis
Random-effectsmeta-analysismethods22forproportionswere
used to aggregate the data from the 13 participating cohorts.
Meta-analyses were performed to estimate the proportion of
participants found to have 1 or more investigable lesions, the
proportion of participants found to have 1 or more new pri-
mary cancers, and the proportion of investigable lesions de-
termined to be new primary cancers, with approximate 95%
CIs.23 The between-cohort heterogeneity τ2, along with the as-
sociated P value, was estimated using the DerSimonian-Laird
method. A logit transformation was used to calculate the over-
all proportions. Cohort participants were additionally subdi-
vided by sex and by age group (0-17, 18-40, or >40 years of age)
to identify age-dependent trends in cancer detection rates and
Key Points
Question Does baseline whole-body magnetic resonance imaging
detect asymptomatic cancers at a curable stage in germline TP53
mutation carriers?
Findings In a meta-analysis of 13 cohorts that included 578
participants, the estimated overall detection rate for previously
unrecognized new, localized malignant neoplasms by a single
baseline scan in TP53 mutation carriers was 7%, and the
false-positive rate was 42.5%. All screen-detected new cancers
were treated with curative intent.
Meaning Baseline evaluation with whole-body magnetic
resonance imaging offers important clinical utility in the
management of cancer risk in TP53 mutation carriers.

Results
Research Surveillance Study Characteristics
This meta-analysis included 578 participants (376 female
[65.1%] and 202 male [34.9%]; mean [SD] age, 33.2 [17.1] years)
withdeleteriousgermlineTP53mutationsfrom13cohortswho
underwentbaselineWBMRIfromJanuary1,2004,throughOc-
tober 1, 2016 (eTable 1 in the Supplement). Of these, 134 (77
female and 57 male) were aged 0 to 17 years, 246 (164 female
and 82 male) were aged 18 to 40 years, and 198 (135 female and
64 male) were older than 40 years. Germline TP53 variant data
available for participants showed 183 unique events, includ-
ing 91 missense, 26 nonsense, 8 frameshift, and 20 intronic
variants and 38 insertions or deletions. Almost half of the par-
ticipants (280 of 578 [48.4%], of whom 211 were female) had
been diagnosed with at least 1 prior malignant neoplasm. Of
the 264 female participants older than 17 years for whom in-
formationwasavailable,17(6.4%)hadasinglemastectomyand
110 (41.7%) had a double mastectomy.

pants,225lesionsrequiringfurtherinvestigationwereobserved
in173participants.Forty-twomalignantlesionswerediagnosed
in 39 individuals, with most of the diagnoses based on biopsy
findings.Fourofthe42malignantlesionswerebraintumorsdi-
agnosed based on imaging alone. Of the new malignant neo-
plasms, 35 localized primary cancers were diagnosed in 34 in-
dividuals, all of whom were treated with curative intent. The
false-positive rate, defined here as the proportion of suspected
neoplasmsthatwerebenign,recurrencesofpreexistingcancers,
or newly diagnosed metastatic cancers, was 42.5% (26 of 61).
Meta-analysis Results
eFigure 1 in the Supplement presents the meta-analysis for the
proportion of participants found to have 1 or more investi-
gable lesions by WBMRI. Overall, 31% (95% CI, 26%-35%) of
participants were estimated to have 1 or more investigable le-
sions. No sex differences were detected (estimated propor-
tion of 31% in both sexes; P = .90, Cochran Q). The proportion
of investigable lesions identified tended to increase with age
from 29% among participants younger than 18 years to 30%
among those aged 18 to 40 years and 34% among those older
than 40 years, but this increase was not statistically signifi-
cant (P = .60 overall, Cochran Q).
eFigure 2 in the Supplement presents the meta-analysis of
the proportion of individuals in whom 1 or more new cancers
was diagnosed. Overall, an estimated 7% (95% CI, 5%-9%) of
participants were determined to have 1 or more new primary
malignant neoplasm. We found no significant difference be-
tween male and female participants (9% and 7%, respectively;
P = .40, Cochran Q). The proportion of cancers identified in-
creased with age in male participants from 10% among those
younger than 18 years and those aged 18 to 40 years to 15%
among those older than 40 years; female participants experi-
enced a midlife reduction in malignant neoplasms detected by
WBMRI (from 15% among those aged <18 years to 8% among
those aged 18-40 years and 10% among those aged >40 years),
but neither difference was statistically significant (P = .30 for
female and P = .60 for male participants, Cochran Q). A meta-
analysis of the proportion of investigable lesions subsequently
identified as a new primary cancer is given in eFigure 3 in the
Supplement. Overall, an estimated 18% (95% CI, 12%-27%) of
investigable lesions identified by WBMRI were determined to
be new primary cancers, with no sex difference (18% for fe-
male and 22% for male participants; P = .50, Cochran Q). The
proportion of cancers identified was highest in those younger
than 18 years (31%) compared with those aged 18 to 40 years
(16%) and those older than 40 years (18%), but this difference
was not statistically significant (P = .15 overall, Cochran Q).
Clinical Spectrum of New Primary Cancers
Detected by WBMRI
The 35 new primary cancers identified by baseline WBMRI oc-
curred in 34 participants (1 woman older than 40 years had a
synchronous localized chromophobe renal cell carcinoma and
a localized uterine leiomyosarcoma). No new primary can-
cers were clinically metastatic at diagnosis. The patterns of

 cancers observed vary by age and sex (Table). All 7 bone sar-
comas were observed in participants younger than 40 years,
with no sex difference, whereas 5 of 7 soft-tissue sarcomas
arose in participants older than 40 years. A single adrenocor-
tical tumor was found in a child, as was a choroid plexus car-
cinoma. The diversity of cancers to which TP53 mutation car-
riers are prone was evident. Other cancers identified included
carcinomas of the lung (4 participants, all aged >40 years), kid-
ney (1 female participant in each age group), thyroid (1 female
participant aged <18 years and 1 aged 18-40 years), prostate (2
male participants aged >40 years), and bowel (1 male partici-
pant aged 18-40 years). We only observed 2 breast cancers (a
ductalcarcinomainsituandaninvasiveductalcarcinoma,each
in1womanaged>40years).Thesefindingsmayreflectthehigh
rate of mastectomies and/or prior breast cancer diagnoses in
the female population undergoing screening, as well as the use
of dedicated breast MRI sequences outside WBMRI.
Malignant neoplasms of the brain represent an important
feature of LFS. Twelve of 13 cohorts included the brain as a rou-
tine part of the WBMRI protocol. In this meta-analysis, brain
tumors appeared to be more common in children and young
adults. Of 6 brain tumors identified by WBMRI, 5 were ob-
served in children and 1 in a woman in the group aged 18 to
40 years (Table). We attempted to determine the ability of the
dedicated brain component of WBMRI in identifying brain tu-
mors. We compared the outcomes of WBMRI with the dedi-
catedbrainMRIwhensuchcomparisonswereavailable(eTable
15 in the Supplement). Of 10 brain tumors identified in indi-
viduals undergoing WBMRI and a dedicated brain MRI, only
5 were identified by the WBMRI, whereas the remainder were
identified by dedicated brain MRI but not by WBMRI. For the
5 brain tumors that were missed on WBMRI, none of the scans
used contrast.
Discussion
This meta-analysis provides, to our knowledge, the first sta-
tistically robust estimate of the potential clinical utility of
WBMRI in screening TP53 mutation carriers. Overall, 1 in 14
participants undergoing their first WBMRI was found to have
a primary malignant neoplasm, which was then treated with
curative intent. The rate of detection of localized malignant
neoplasms was remarkably consistent between individual co-
horts, studies of which were conducted across 6 countries and
13 institutions. The rate at which cancers were identified ap-
peared to be highest among children and lowest among young
adults and increased again among older adults. The spec-
trum of cancers shifts with age, with a greater number of brain
tumors and bone sarcomas in children and a range of epithe-
lial malignant neoplasms in older adults. All screen-detected
cancers were treated with curative intent, although the
follow-up of those participants in whom cancers were identi-
fied and treated curatively was too short to assess long-term
outcomes. Whole-body MRI does not reliably identify brain tu-
mors in TP53 mutation carriers. Another important outcome
of WBMRI is the detection of benign but clinically significant
lesions that are medically actionable, for example, by caus-
ing organ damage through local growth or undergoing malig-
nant transformation in this high-risk population.
Theabsenceofbreastcancersinthisscreenedpopulationwas
notable. Breast cancer is the most common diagnosis among
womenwithTP53mutationswhoareyoungerthan40years,8but
only 2 women with breast cancer were identified in this meta-
analysis(bothaged>40years).Thisfindingmayreflectthehigh
percentageofwomenwhohadundergoneunilateralorbilateral

ityofWBMRItodetectsmallbreastlesions,ortheroutineuseof

however,thequestionoftheimportanceofcontrastasaneffec-

patients will be essential to reveal the rate of cancer develop-
ment in these cohorts, identify the optimal scheduling of
WBMRI, and determine whether early detection of cancers in
TP53 mutation carriers will translate into decreased morbid-
ity and better survival. Estimates of the cost-effectiveness of
WBMRI also lie beyond the scope of the present study but will
be important to implementation in clinical practice.
