Urinary p75ECD
A prognostic, disease progression, and pharmacodynamic
biomarker in ALS
ABSTRACT
Objective: To evaluate urinary neurotrophin receptor p75 extracellular domain (p75ECD) levels as
disease progression and prognostic biomarkers in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).
Methods: The population in this study comprised 45 healthy controls and 54 people with ALS, 31
of whom were sampled longitudinally. Urinary p75ECD was measured using an enzyme-linked
immunoassay and validation included intra-assay and inter-assay coefficients of variation, effect
of circadian rhythm, and stability over time at room temperature, 48C, and repeated freeze-thaw
cycles. Longitudinal changes in urinary p75ECD were examined by mixed model analysis, and the
prognostic value of baseline p75ECD was explored by survival analysis.
Results: Confirming our previous findings, p75ECD was higher in patients with ALS (5.6 6 2.2 ng/
mg creatinine) compared to controls (3.6 6 1.4 ng/mg creatinine, p , 0.0001). Assay reproduc-
ibility was high, with p75ECD showing stability across repeated freeze-thaw cycles, at room
temperature and 48C for 2 days, and no diurnal variation. Urinary p75ECD correlated with the
revised ALS Functional Rating Scale at first evaluation (r 5 20.44, p 5 0.008) and across all
study visits (r 5 20.36, p , 0.0001). p75ECD also increased as disease progressed at an average
rate of 0.19 ng/mg creatinine per month (p , 0.0001). In multivariate prognostic analysis, bulbar
onset (hazard ratio [HR] 3.0, p 5 0.0035), rate of disease progression from onset to baseline (HR
4.4, p , 0.0001), and baseline p75ECD (HR 1.3, p 5 0.0004) were predictors of survival.
Conclusions: The assay for urinary p75ECD is analytically robust and shows promise as an ALS
biomarker with prognostic, disease progression, and potential pharmacodynamic application.
Baseline urinary p75ECD provides prognostic information and is currently the only biological
fluid–based biomarker of disease progression. Neurology® 2017;88:1137–1143

Frustration over the continued failure of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) clinical trials1,2 and
the absence of therapeutic options for this fatal disease3 has fueled interest in the prospect that
biomarkers may hold great promise for advancing therapy development efforts.4,5 Prognostic
biomarkers, which aid in predicting the future course of disease, might be used to identify more
homogeneous subsets of patients at the time of trial enrollment. Pharmacodynamic biomarkers,
which have the potential to show that a biological response has occurred in a patient who has
received an experimental therapeutic, may help in assessing the efficacy of drugs selected in phase
II to advance to phase III clinical trials. Disease progression biomarkers (i.e., those that show
a change over time as disease advances) may also serve as markers of pharmacodynamic effect.

 Among the biological fluid–based biomarker
candidates, the cytoskeletal proteins neurofila-
ment light (NfL) and phosphorylated neuro-
filament heavy (pNfH) show great promise as
prognostic markers and potential pharmaco-
dynamic biomarkers. However, since neuro-
filament levels remain largely stable over
time,6–8 they do not reflect disease progression.
Therefore, we currently lack any biological
fluid–based biomarkers of disease progression.
This has led us to focus on the common neu-
rotrophin receptor (p75) as a biomarker of
motor neuron degeneration. Based on pre-
liminary observations that the extracellular
domain of p75 (p75ECD) is present at elevated
levels in the urine of patients with ALS com-
pared to healthy individuals9 and that urinary
p75 increases in the SOD1G93A mouse as disease
unfolds,10 we investigated the potential of uri-
nary p75ECD as a potential disease progression
and prognostic biomarker.
METHODS Standard protocol approvals, registrations,
and patient consents. This was a prospective cohort study in
which urine samples from patients with ALS and controls were
collected from the South Australian MND Clinic (Adelaide, Aus-
tralia) and the Kessenich Family ALS Center at the University of
Miami (Miami, FL).
Written informed consent was obtained from all participants
following ethics approval from the Flinders University of South
Australia Southern Adelaide Clinical Human Research Ethics
Committee and the University of Miami Human Subject
Research Office. Patients with ALS (recruited between March
2011 and March 2015) were diagnosed according to the revised
El Escorial criteria11 by experienced ALS neurologists (Australia:
D.S.; United States: M.B.). Healthy controls (recruited between
June 2008 and February 2015) were typically spouses and friends
of patients and exclusion criteria included any neurologic condi-
tion or illness that affects kidney function. Sample size was driven
by pragmatic considerations related to the availability of funding
for this pilot project. Clinical information was collected by inves-
tigators blinded to urinary p75ECD results, including the revised
ALS Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRS-R), and latencies from
symptom onset and diagnosis to baseline assessment and sample
collection. The estimated monthly decrease in ALSFRS-R by
time of first assessment (baseline) was calculated as DFRS 5
(48 2 ALSFRS-R at baseline)/number of months between symp-
tom onset and baseline.12 Permanent assisted ventilation (PAV)
was defined as the use of noninvasive ventilation for at least 23 h/
d or tracheostomy with initiation of invasive ventilation. Urine
samples were collected and stored in accordance with the Urine &
Kidney Proteome Project Standards13 and coded to ensure ano-
nymity. Samples collected in Miami were shipped on dry ice and
all samples were stored at 2808C until analysis. Urinary creati-
nine and osmolarity measurements were performed using a Roche
(Basel, Switzerland)/Hitachi (Tokyo, Japan) modular analyzer.
Urinary p75ECD measurement. A sandwich ELISA was used
to quantify p75ECD as previously described.9 Briefly, ELISA plates
(96-well, Costar Corning [Manassas, VA]) were coated with
mouse anti-human p75 MLR1 antibody14 for p75 capture and
incubated for 18 hours at 48C in bicarbonate buffer, pH 9.6.
Wells were then blocked with sample buffer, phosphate-
buffered saline (PBS) containing 2% bovine serum albumin,
and 0.01% thimerosal, pH 7.4, for 1 hour at 378C. Urine
samples and recombinant human p75ECD standard (amino acids
29–250; R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) were diluted in
sample buffer and incubated for 20 hours at room temperature.

 (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) antibodies were
used
for
p75ECD
detection
for
1
hour
each
at
room
temperature, and the peroxidase reaction was developed using
TMB (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) and stopped using 2M sulfuric
acid. Plates were washed between steps (PBS, 0.05% Tween 20,
0.01% thimerosal, pH 7.4), and were read using a PerkinElmer
(Waltham, MA) Victor-x4 plate reader.
The detection limit and reproducibility of p75ECD measure-
ment was determined by testing recombinant human p75ECD stan-
dard (R&D Systems) and 3 urine samples across 8 plates. The
lowest detection limit was calculated by plotting the p75ECD stan-
dard curve with a log10 x-axis. Intra-assay and inter-assay reproduc-
ibility was determined by testing 3 urine samples with low,
medium, and high p75ECD/mL measurements in duplicate, across
8 plates, to determine the coefficient of variation (CV). In addition,
the diurnal fluctuation of urinary p75ECD was determined in
healthy individuals by comparing measurements made from a first
void sample in the morning, a random spot urine in the afternoon/
evening, and a sample collected over 24-hours. p75ECD stability was
determined by repeatedly assaying samples stored at room temper-
ature (;238C) or 48C for up to 7 days. In addition, samples were
subjected to 1–4 freeze-thaw cycles switching between 2808C and
room temperature (;238C) for 15 minutes per cycle and p75ECD
measured after each freeze/thaw.
Statistical analysis. Intra-assay and inter-assay reproducibility of
ELISA measurements are expressed as CVs. Linear regression was
used to describe the linearity of a standard curve for human
p75ECD. Urinary p75ECD levels were compared between patients
with ALS and controls by 2-sample t test. The relationships
among
baseline
age,
urinary
p75ECD,
creatinine,
urinary
osmolarity, and ALSFRS-R scores were assessed by Pearson
correlation.
The
correlation
between
urinary
p75ECD
and
ALSFRS-R were further assessed by including data from baseline
as well as longitudinal follow-ups, with and without adjustment for
repeated measures.15 In the 31 patients with ALS who had
longitudinal samples, the rate of urinary p75ECD increase over
time—with time defined as months since diagnosis (primary
analysis), symptom onset, or baseline (first urine collection)—was
ascertained by mixed model analysis; quadratic and interaction
terms were considered. In addition, the association between
baseline urinary p75ECD levels and survival (time to death or
PAV) was evaluated by Cox proportional hazards model, and
graphically illustrated by dividing the patients into those with
baseline p75ECD above vs below the median value and plotting
their Kaplan-Meier survival curves. Summary statistics are
presented as mean 6 SD, median, range, or frequency and
percentage. A p value of ,0.05 (2-sided) was considered
statistically significant. Longitudinal and survival analyses were
performed using SAS 9.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC); all other
analyses were performed, and figures generated, using GraphPad
Prism 6 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA).
RESULTS Study population. The study population
includes 45 healthy controls and 54 patients with
ALS (table 1). In the subset of 31 patients with
ALS with longitudinal follow-up, 26 (84%) reached
PAV or death. Median disease duration (from
diagnosis) among all 54 patients was 18.4 months
(25th–75th percentile: 11.1–32.4).
Urinary p75ECD in healthy controls and patients with
ALS. Among healthy controls, urinary p75ECD corre-
lates with age (Pearson r 5 0.31, p 5 0.04) but
increases only by 0.32 ng/mg creatinine for each
advancing decade. Although the control group was
younger than the ALS population, the potential utility
of p75ECD as a disease progression or prognostic marker
is independent of comparison to the control group and
therefore not affected by this age difference. Sex is not
a significant determinant of urinary p75ECD.
Confirming
our
previous
findings,9
urinary
p75ECD levels are higher in patients with ALS
(5.6 6 2.2 ng/mg creatinine) at first study visit (base-
line) compared to controls (3.6 6 1.4 ng/mg creati-
nine, p , 0.0001, figure 1). Baseline urinary p75ECD
levels do not differ significantly between patients with
limb vs bulbar onset disease, even after controlling for
baseline disease severity.
Analytic validation of urinary p75ECD. Confirming our
previous observation of the linearity of the standard
curve (absorbance and human urinary p75ECD con-
centration) for our in-house ELISA,9 here we show an
assay sensitivity of ;70 pg/mL and a linear standard
curve up to 2.5 ng/mL (figure e-1, A–C, at
Neurology.org).
Our
assay
for
human
urinary
p75ECD demonstrates reliability with an intra-assay
CV of 6.6% and an inter-assay CV of 12.5% (table
e-1). Urinary p75ECD levels remained steady after
multiple freeze-thaw cycles (figure e-1D). The level
of p75ECD detected was also stable in 3 samples after
2-day of storage both at room temperature and at
48C, although from 2 to 7 days there was some
variation from that measured in freshly collected
urine (i.e., at time 0; figure e-1E). Diurnal variation
in p75ECD was tested in controls (n 5 2), between
first void in the morning, a spot urine sample in the
afternoon, and 24-hour samples. The variation

 between the spot urine and the first void in
addition to the spot and the 24-hour samples was
modest (below 17%). When urinary dilution was
considered by correcting with creatinine (as we
routinely do for reporting results), the difference
between spot and first void and spot and 24-hour
sample decreased to 7% (figure e-1F). In addition,
creatinine was a reliable measure of urinary dilution,
based on the strong correlation with urine osmolarity
(figure e-1G, r 5 0.88, p , 0.0001).
Urinary p75ECD as biomarker of disease progression. The
potential utility of p75ECD as a biomarker of disease
progression was explored in the 31 patients with ALS
with longitudinal data and urine samples (median of
3 time points, range 2–6; table 1). To assess change in
p75ECD over time, we considered 3 options for the
time base—namely, time since symptom onset, time
since diagnosis, and time since the initial evaluation
and sample collection (i.e., baseline)—and the limi-
tations of each. Symptom onset relies upon subjective
report of symptoms and the decision of which symp-
toms represent the onset of disease. On the other
hand, baseline date is somewhat arbitrary, as patients
were enrolled at variable stages in the course of dis-
ease. While the delay from symptom onset to diag-
nosis can be highly variable, the date of diagnosis is
reliably obtained from clinic notes, patient self-report,
and medical record review. For these reasons, we
elected a priori in our longitudinal analyses to use
time from diagnosis for primary analysis. Results of
our
mixed
model
analysis
show
that
urinary
concentration of p75ECD increases linearly and on
average by 0.19 ng/mg creatinine each month (p ,
0.0001; figure 2A). Adjusting for baseline p75ECD
does not significantly affect the slope, suggesting
a fairly uniform rate of p75ECD change over time,
irrespective of concentration at the earliest time
point (data not shown). Adjusting for age similarly
does not affect the slope of increase of p75ECD, likely
because the effect of age is seen over decades rather
than years, and median follow-up duration in this
study was 10.8 months (range 0.4–43 months).
Models using time from symptom onset and time
from baseline show similar results (figure 2, B and C).
For comparison, we performed similar mixed
model analyses with ALSFRS-R as the outcome mea-
sure. In the same 31 patients, average rate of
ALSFRS-R decline was 0.82 points/month (95% CI
0.68–0.97, p , 0.0001), comparable to reported rate
in other longitudinal observational studies and clinical
trials.16 Similar to p75ECD, adjustment for baseline
ALSFRS-R had little effect on the slope (data not
shown). Moreover, using data from all 115 person-
visits, there was a correlation between ALSFRS-R
and p75ECD (r 5 20.36, p , 0.0001), which was
essentially unchanged after adjusting for the within-
person correlation due to repeated measures (figure
3A). This correlation was also apparent when compar-
ing ALSFRS-R and p75ECD at baseline for each of the
54 patients (figure 3B; r 5 20.44, p 5 0.0008).
Urinary p75ECD as prognostic biomarker. To explore the
potential utility of baseline p75ECD as a predictor of
prognosis, we performed a survival analysis using Cox

 proportional hazards model, including data from all
54 patients with ALS. In univariate analyses, neither
age at diagnosis nor sex was associated with survival,
but in agreement with prior studies,12,17 both bulbar
onset (p 5 0.0085) and DFRS (p , 0.0001) were
predictors of survival. In multivariate models, adjust-
ing for bulbar onset (hazard ratio [HR] 3.0, 95%
confidence interval [CI] 1.4–6.3, p 5 0.0035) and
DFRS (HR 4.4, 95% CI 2.4–8.0, p , 0.0001), base-
line p75ECD was also a predictor of survival (HR 1.3,
95% CI 1.1–1.5, p 5 0.0004), indicating that base-
line p75ECD provides additional prognostic value over
and above what can be gleaned from routinely avail-
able clinical parameters. To visually illustrate the
relationship between baseline p75ECD and survival,
we divided the 54 patients into high vs low p75ECD
groups (i.e., based on their baseline value being above
or below the median), and present their Kaplan-
Meier survival plot (figure 4).
DISCUSSION Our pursuit of urinary p75ECD as
a potential ALS biomarker was informed by the biol-
ogy of the neurotrophin receptor p75. Rodent motor
neurons express p75 during development18 but this
disappears soon after birth only to be re-expressed
after injury,19,20 including apoptotic motor neurons
of SOD1G93A mice.21 p75ECD is cleaved from cell
membranes
post
injury,19
with
elevated
levels
detected 40 days prior to onset of disease in the
urine of SOD1G93A mice, progressively rising as
symptoms unfold.9,10 p75 is also re-expressed on
motor
neurons22
and
Schwann
cells23
in
postmortem tissue of patients with ALS. Hence, the
presence
of
p75ECD
in
urine
is
indicative
of
underlying motor neuron degeneration. While ALS
is heterogeneous in etiology, biology, and phenotypic
manifestations,24
it
is
always
characterized
by
degeneration and death of motor neurons. As
a generic biomarker of motor neuron degeneration,
therefore, urinary p75ECD is expected to be useful as
biomarker in all forms of ALS, irrespective of
etiology. This stands in contrast, for example, to
C9RANT dipeptides, which may have utility as
a pharmacodynamic biomarker only in patients
with ALS due to a C9ORF72 repeat expansion.5
The most striking and important aspect of our
findings is that urinary p75ECD changes over time,
increasing as disease progresses and motor function
declines. This is true even in patients with slowly
progressive disease in which the absolute values of
p75ECD remain relatively low (figure 2). In this
respect, p75ECD is currently the only potential bio-
chemical biomarker of ALS disease progression. In
addition, p75ECD may have utility as a potential phar-
macodynamic biomarker insofar as showing that an
experimental therapeutic that blunts the increase, sta-
bilizes, or reduces urinary p75ECD over time would
provide evidence of an underlying biological effect of
the treatment.25 Urinary p75ECD therefore joins CSF
and blood NfL6,26–32 and CSF pNfH7,33–35 as the lead
candidates for further development as pharmacody-
namic biomarkers. The important difference is that
neurofilament levels, although elevated in ALS com-
pared to controls,6,7,26–34,36 are largely stable over
time, with the possible exception of patients with
rapidly progressive disease, in whom CSF NfL may
increase,6 and levels of blood pNfH may decrease
over time.7 These data suggest that NfL and pNfH
may also have potential utility as pharmacodynamic
biomarkers.

unchanged (r 5 20.37). (B) Urinary p75ECD also correlates with ALSFRS-R at first study visit

 In addition to its value as a disease progression and
pharmacodynamic biomarker, urinary p75ECD may
have value as a prognostic biomarker. Essential to this
claim is the observation that baseline p75ECD informs
the probability of survival in a way that supplements
the prognostic value of readily available clinical pa-
rameters such as site of disease onset and DFRS, even
though the HR for the effect of p75ECD is modest.
While
other
biochemical
biomarkers
including
pNfH8,34,36 and NfL6,31 levels in blood and CSF have
been reported to have prognostic utility, published
data have not (yet) demonstrated that they add prog-
nostic value over and beyond what can be learned
from clinical parameters.
Moreover, p75ECD is currently the sole ALS bio-
marker that is measurable in urine, a biological fluid
that is readily accessible and which most patients are
willing to provide. While blood is also readily acces-
sible, not all patients are willing or able to undergo
lumbar puncture to obtain CSF, especially longitu-
dinally. Since patient comfort and compliance are
important pragmatic considerations, especially in
clinical trials, obtaining urine for p75ECD quantifi-
cation may be more practical than the more invasive
and logistically complex option of obtaining CSF. In
addition, the less complex nature of the urinary pro-
teome than that of blood is an advantage in assaying
proteins such as p75ECD. Notwithstanding these
considerations, we are also exploring measurement
of p75ECD in blood, which will enable validation of
these findings using banked samples previously col-
lected from patients.
This study is not without its limitations. Most nota-
bly, the study population represents a sample of conve-
nience, with the attendant risk that the cohort is biased
towards patients with more slowly progressive and per-
haps more advanced disease. Moreover, the limited
number of samples and assessments available from each
patient precluded reliable estimation of the individual
rates of ALSFRS-R decline,25 thereby limiting our abil-
ity to explore whether baseline p75ECD is useful in pre-
dicting prognosis in terms of future rate of ALSFRS-R
decline, in addition to survival. These shortcomings,
however, will be addressed through an ongoing valida-
tion study being performed as part of the Clinical
Research in ALS and Related Disorders for Therapeutic
Development (CReATe) consortium. In this study
(NCT02327845), urine samples are collected every
3–6 months (over an 18- to 24-month period), along
with rigorously and prospectively collected deep clinical
phenotypic data.
Urinary p75ECD currently stands alone as a bio-
fluid-based biomarker that adds prognostic value to
readily available clinical parameters, and changes lon-
gitudinally in individual patients with ALS as disease
progresses. Urinary p75ECD and blood and CSF
quantification of pNfH and NfL represent the most
promising potential pharmacodynamic biomarkers
available today that are suitable for further investiga-
tion in the context of future clinical trials.
