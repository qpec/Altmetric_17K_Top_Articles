 INTRODUCTION
Anaphylaxis is a ‘serious allergic event that 
is rapid in onset and may cause death’.1 
Pre-filled 
adrenaline 
auto-injectors 
(AAI) are provided to individuals at high 
risk of anaphylaxis for emergency self-
administration, to prevent worsening of early 
symptoms of anaphylaxis.2
Since their introduction into the UK in 
March 1996,2 prescription rates of these 
devices in the community has increased 
exponentially.3 The current UK and European 
paediatric guidelines suggest that a child 
with minor reactions to peanuts or tree nuts 
could be prescribed an AAI.4,5 Others argue 
that the devices should only be prescribed 
to children who have experienced moderate 
or severe allergic reactions.6 The British 
Society of Allergy and Clinical Immunology 
(BSACI) has also laid down guidance for the 
prescription of these devices.7 However, it 
is well recognised that reaction history to 
an allergen does not predict the severity of 
subsequent reactions.8,9 A recent survey of 
UK physicians showed that there was a great 
deal of heterogeneity in the prescription of 
these devices.10
Although previous publications from 
England and Australia have documented 
the increase in the number of AAIs being 
prescribed to children in the community,3,11 
the true extent of this in the UK has not yet 
been explored.
METHOD
The authors used data from The Health 
Improvement Network (THIN). The database 
currently includes information from 587 
primary care practices across the UK, 
covering more than 12 million patients (about 
3.6 million active patients), who represent 
about 6% of the entire UK population.12 These 
data are representative of the UK population 
by age, sex, medical conditions, and death 
rates adjusted for demographics and social 
deprivation.13 Participating practices use 
Vision software to maintain patient records 
and issue prescriptions. Prescription data 
from THIN have been previously validated 
for pharmacoepidemiological research.14
Study population
All children and young people aged 
0–17 years registered for a minimum of 
1 year between 1 January 2000 and 
31 December 2012 in primary care practices 
contributing to the THIN database were 
included in the analysis. The children 
contributed to the dataset from the time 
of their registration with the practice until 
the earliest of their 18th birthday, transfer 
to another surgery, death, or last data

Abstract
Background
Adrenaline auto-injectors (AAI) should be 
provided to individuals considered to be at high 
risk of anaphylaxis. There is some evidence 
that the rate of AAI prescription is increasing, 
but the true extent has not been previously 
quantified.
Aim
To estimate the trends in annual GP-issued 
prescriptions for AAI among UK children 
between 2000 and 2012.
Design and setting
Retrospective cohort study using data from 
primary care practices that contributed to The 
Health Improvement Network (THIN) database.
Method
Children and young people aged between 
0–17 years of age with a prescription for AAIs 
were identified, and annual AAI device prescription 
rates were estimated using Stata (version 12).
Results
A total of 1.06 million UK children were 
identified, providing 5.1 million person years 
of follow-up data. Overall, 23 837 children 
were deemed high risk by their GPs, and were 
prescribed 98 737 AAI devices. This equates 
to 4.67 children (95% confidence interval 
[CI] = 4.66 to 4.69), and 19.4 (95% CI = 19.2 to 
19.5) devices per 1000 person years. Between 
2000 and 2012, there has been a 355% increase 
in the number of children prescribed devices, 
and a 506% increase in the total number of AAI 
devices prescribed per 1000 person years in the 
UK. The number of devices issued per high-risk 
child during this period has also increased by 
33%. 
Conclusion
The number of children being prescribed 
AAI devices and the number of devices being 
prescribed in UK primary care between 
2000 and 2012 has significantly increased. A 
discussion to promote rational prescribing of 
AAIs in the NHS is needed.

 collection from the practice. 
Statistical analysis
The authors identified AAI devices based 
on their generic names (Table 1) using 
database specific code lists. All the children 
contributing to the database were considered 
at risk and constituted the denominator
. It 
was presumed that children who had had an 
AAI prescribed were considered to be at risk 
of anaphylaxis by their GPs and they were 
designated as high risk for the purposes of 
the study. 
The main outcomes of interest were the 
temporal trends in:
• the number of high-risk children per 1000 
UK children (defined as any child who was 
issued with a prescription for AAI); 
• the number of AAI devices issued per 
1000 UK children between the years 2000 
and 2012; and 
• the mean number of devices issued per 
high-risk child per year
. 
Evidence for indication for AAI prescription 
was looked for by searching Read Codes for 
common food allergies, venom allergy, and 
some codes for anaphylaxis.7 (Box 1)
Analysis was carried out using Stata 
(version 12) and graphs were produced 
using Microsoft Excel 2010.
RESULTS
A total of 1.06 million UK children <18 years 
of age were registered between 2000 and 
2012, providing 5.1 million person years of 
follow-up data. Overall, 23 837 children were 
deemed high risk by their GPs and were 
prescribed a total of 98 737 AAI devices 
during the study period. This equates to 4.67 
high-risk children (95% confidence interval 
[CI] = 4.66 to 4.69), and 19.4 (95% CI = 19.2 to 
19.5) devices per 1000 person years. About 
50% of these children (12 000) were noted 
as having egg, nut, seafood, insect venom 
allergy, or previous anaphylaxis by their 
physicians. 
The data show a 355% increase in the 
proportion of children in the community 
issued with AAI devices, a 506% increase 
in the proportion of AAI devices prescribed 
in the community, and a 33% increase in 
the number of devices issued per high-
risk child between the years 2000 and 
2012 (Figure 1 and Table 2). The number 
of devices prescribed per child per year 
varied significantly, and ranged from 0 to 
40. Regression analysis revealed that all 
these trends are statistically significant at 
P<0.0001. 
In addition, 31% of the high-risk children 
received two AAI devices, and 27% received 
four devices per year
. A few children (8%) 
received only one, and 24% received more 
than four devices per year
. On average, 
each high-risk child received 3.84 devices 
per year during the study period. When the 
data were arbitrarily divided into two groups 
(2000–2006 and 2007–2012), the authors 
found that the proportion of high-risk 
children receiving four or more devices is 
increasing (41% in 2000–2006 versus 54% in 
How this fits in
The rate of anaphylaxis in England is 
increasing, and the number of adrenaline 
auto-injectors (AAIs) dispensed in England 
between 2000 and 2012 has also increased. 
This study demonstrates that more 
children are being prescribed AAI devices 
within the UK by their GP, and that the 
number of devices being prescribed per 
child is also increasing. The annual costs 
to the NHS are significant, and a discussion 
regarding rational prescribing of AAI 
devices in children is warranted.

 2007–2012) (Figure 2). The types of devices 
prescribed commonly are shown in Table 1. 
Almost all of the children ≤5 years of age 
were prescribed a ‘junior’ device (150 μg 
adrenaline per dose), whereas just over half 
of those ≥6 years (52.5%) had a junior device. 
The average cost of an AAI device was 
£25.80 (95% CI = £24.7 to £26.9).15 Given 
that the THIN database represents 6% of 
the UK population, the authors estimate 
that the annual expenditure on AAI devices 
for children in the UK was approximately 
£6.89 million in 2012.
DISCUSSION
Summary
The data show a sharp increase in both 
the proportion of children prescribed AAI 
devices and the number of AAI devices 
prescribed for early management of 
anaphylaxis between the years 2000 and 
2012 in the UK. Given that only half of the 
‘high-risk’ children were noted as having 
a previous relevant allergy or anaphylaxis 
diagnosis, the rationale for prescribing is, in 
many cases, unclear
.

 variation in the number of devices prescribed 
to children in the UK. One-quarter of all 
high-risk children receive more than four 
devices in a year
. More than 2% receive 
>10 devices per year
. Of potential concern 
is the significant increase in the number of 
devices being prescribed to children ≤1 year 
old (Table 2), given that AAI devices were, 
until recently, unlicensed for use in children 
who weigh <15 kg.8,16 Recent changes to 
licensing indications for Epipen®, however, 
allow for a junior dose to be prescribed to 
children who weigh between 7.5 and 25 kg.17
The rate of admissions into hospitals 
in England for anaphylaxis has increased 
over this period, although mortality rates 
have decreased.3 It is not clear whether 
these reductions in mortality are directly 
related to the increase in AAI prescription. 
Assuming that the admission rates into 
UK hospitals for anaphylaxis was seven 
per 100 000 in 2012,3 the authors estimate 
that approximately 400 devices were 
prescribed per child admitted into hospital 
in that year
. The benefits and risks of such 
prescribing are not clear
. The current annual 
expenditure on AAI devices for children in 
the UK is approximately £7 million. Given 
that these devices have a limited shelf-life 
and need to be renewed regularly, the costs 
could escalate considerably if the current 
trend continues.
Strengths and limitations 
This study is the first to provide individual 
level, longitudinal data on the availability 
of AAI among children in the UK. The 
authors used the THIN database, a large 
primary care dataset that has been 
shown to be reliable and representative of 
the UK population.13 Although there are 
some concerns regarding the quality of 
data and coding in healthcare datasets in 
general,18 it is accepted that they provide a 
credible snapshot of healthcare demand 
and provision across the country.19 Primary 
care practices use their clinical system to 
issue prescriptions; prescribing data are, 
therefore, likely to be reliable and complete. 
Since the majority of adrenaline devices in 
the UK are obtained using prescriptions 
from GPs, this analysis is likely to represent 
the true availability of these devices in the 
community.
Data from THIN only identify individuals 
who actively consult their GP
. Children who 
have allergies but do not consult their GP 
will not be represented in the database. 
A further limitation of the study is the 
lack of comprehensive data regarding the 
indications for AAI prescription, the reasons 
for repeat prescriptions, and the number 
of episodes of anaphylaxis/serious allergy 
experienced by an individual. It was also 
not possible for the authors to ascertain 
if all of the prescriptions were dispensed. 
The dataset only included data until 2012. 
However, the authors do not expect that 
more recent data will show significant 
deviations from the trends demonstrated. 
Comparison with existing literature
The increase in the rate of prescription of 
AAI devices in England has been reported 
by others.3,20 However, this is the first report

 prescribing practices for AAI to UK children. 
The authors are able to demonstrate an 
increase in the number of children receiving 
these devices, as well as in the number of 
devices received per child.
Implications for practice and research
This study clearly demonstrates that there 
has been a significant increase in the 
number of children being prescribed AAI 
devices in the UK. In addition, there has 
been an increase in the average number 
of devices being prescribed per child in 
the community. This places a significant 
financial burden on the NHS. 
The role of AAI in the management of 
anaphylaxis is not very clear
. Some suggest 
that it should be administered early in the 
onset 
of 
anaphylaxis, 
and 
such 
use 
can 
indeed 
reduce the need for adrenaline in hospital 
and subsequent hospital admission.21 
However, fatalities occur despite early and 
appropriate use of AAI.8 A 2014 review by 
the Medicines and Healthcare Products 
Regulatory Agency (MHRA) suggested that 
the currently marketed AAI devices may not 
provide a sufficient intramuscular dose of 
adrenaline in most individuals, increasing 
the uncertainty around their efficacy in 
emergencies.2 Recent guidance published 
by the BSACI suggested that only one AAI 
should be issued per individual, although 
children may be issued with two (one for 
home and one for school). Prescribing 
two devices can be considered in certain 
situations (for example, in the case of a 
patient who is obese, remoteness from 
medical help, or a history of previous 
anaphylaxis needing two AAI injections).7 
Although there are some arguments 
that AAI devices provide reassurance to 
parents and children, others have shown 
that carrying these devices is sometimes 
detrimental to health-related quality of life 
(HRQoL).22 There are no clear guidelines 
on the optimal number of devices per child. 
The MHRA has recommended that a second 
device should be carried by every patient 
as a backup.2 Although a recent survey 
suggested that most UK clinicians advise 
that patients carry two AAIs with them at 
all times,10 this analysis suggests that most 
children are prescribed more than two 
devices per year
.
The short shelf life of the devices at the 
time of purchase may result in multiple 
prescriptions in a given year
. Parents or 
carers may request additional devices to hold 
with childminders or other family members, 
in addition to those at home and school. In 
general, there are no data to suggest that 
provision of extra (beyond two) devices can 
be life-saving or provide reassurance.23 In 
order to be effective, devices should be 
prescribed alongside appropriate training 
and support in their use. Unfortunately, this 
is often lacking.8 In addition, it is difficult to 
ensure that individuals always carry AAIs 
with them, that their devices are in date, and 
that their training is updated regularly to 
ensure correct administration of the device 
in an emergency.8 
Hence there is a need for a robust 
discussion on the rational prescribing of 
AAI devices. Indications for AAI prescription 
among children and on the optimal number 
of devices that can be issued per child 
need to be clarified. This will not only have 
implications for the wellbeing of patients 
at risk of anaphylaxis, but can also be cost 
saving to the NHS.
