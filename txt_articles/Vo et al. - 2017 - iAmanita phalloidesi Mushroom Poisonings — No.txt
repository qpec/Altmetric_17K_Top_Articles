Amanita phalloides, colloquially known as the “death cap,” 
belongs to the Phalloideae section of the Amanita family of 
mushrooms and is responsible for most deaths following inges-
tion of foraged mushrooms worldwide (1). On November 28, 
2016, members of the Bay Area Mycological Society notified 
personnel at the California Poison Control System (CPCS) 
of an unusually large A. phalloides bloom in the greater San 
Francisco Bay Area, coincident with the abundant rainfall and 
recent warm weather. Five days later, CPCS received notifica-
tion of the first human A. phalloides poisoning of the season. 
Over the following 2 weeks, CPCS was notified of an addi-
tional 13 cases of hepatotoxicity resulting from A. phalloides 
ingestion. In the past few years before this outbreak, CPCS 
received reports of only a few mushroom poisoning cases per 
year. A summary of 14 reported cases is presented here. Data 
extracted from patient medical charts revealed a pattern of 
delayed gastrointestinal manifestations of intoxication leading 
to dehydration and hepatotoxicity. Three patients received liver 
transplants and all but one recovered completely. The morbid-
ity and potential lethality associated with A. phalloides ingestion 
are serious public health concerns and warrant medical provider 
education and dissemination of information cautioning against 
consuming foraged wild mushrooms.
Initial case. A man aged 37 years (patient A) picked two wild 
mushrooms in Santa Rosa, California (Table). He cooked and 
ate one mushroom, and approximately 10 hours later developed 
nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. He was evaluated in a local 
emergency department (ED) for abdominal discomfort 20.5 
hours after ingestion. A mycologist identified the uncooked 
mushroom sample provided by the patient as A. phalloides. 
Initial laboratory findings were notable for an elevated white 
blood cell count with lactate elevation and elevated creatinine 
suggesting dehydration (Table). Liver function tests (LFTs) 
6 hours later showed elevated aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 
(92 IU/L; normal = 15–41) and alanine aminotransferase 
(ALT) (95 IU/L; normal = 17–63) levels. He was treated with 
aggressive intravenous (IV) fluid hydration, IV octreotide,* 
and IV silibinin.† Two days after ingestion, the patient’s 
LFTs peaked at AST = 6,159 IU/L, ALT = 3,084 IU/L, total 
bilirubin = 2.9 mg/dL (normal = 0.2–1.2), and international 
normalized ratio (INR) (standardized prothrombin time) 
3.2 units (normal = 0.8–1.2). Gastrointestinal symptoms and 
laboratory values gradually improved, and the patient was 
discharged home on day 6.
* Octreotide, by preventing emptying of the gallbladder, might reduce 
recirculation of amatoxins in bile to the liver.
† Silibinin dihemisuccinate, a milk thistle extract, competitively inhibits hepatic 
amatoxin uptake and enterohepatic recycling, and is available in the United 
States through an open clinical trial.

Household cluster. A woman aged 26 years (patient B) pre-
pared and grilled wild mushrooms for dinner for her husband 
(patient C, 28 years), her daughter (patient D, 18 months), 
her sister (patient E, 38 years), and a female friend (patient F, 
49 years). The mushrooms had been given to her by a person 
she did not know, who reportedly picked them earlier in the 
day in the mountains. The mother, father, and child ate four, 
three, and one-half mushroom caps, respectively; the mother’s 
sister ate one cap and stalk, and the friend ate “pieces.”
All persons who consumed the mushrooms developed 
nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea approximately 9 hours after 
ingestion. The mother, father and child (patients B, C, and D) 
visited the ED 20 hours after ingestion with dehydration and 
gastrointestinal distress. All patients had laboratory values 
consistent with hepatic injury (Table). The patients were 
treated with aggressive IV fluid hydration, IV octreotide, 
and IV silibinin. Two days after ingestion of the mushrooms, 
the mother’s LFTs peaked at AST 11,427, ALT 9,693, total 
bilirubin 2.4 mg/dL, and INR 3.2 units. The father’s LFTs 
peaked on hospital day 1 with AST 6,123 IU/L, ALT 4,401 
IU/L, and total bilirubin 2.8 on hospital day 2. Both parents’ 
symptoms improved, and they were discharged on hospital 
days 6 and 4, respectively. The child developed irreversible 
fulminant hepatic failure and required mechanical ventila-
tion because of hepatic encephalopathy. She underwent a 
liver transplant 6 days after ingestion of the mushroom with 
a complicated postoperative course that included cerebral 
edema and permanent neurologic impairment.
The sister of the woman who prepared the meal (patient E) 
visited the ED before her other family members, but was dis-
charged home after administration of IV fluids and antiemetic 
medications, with a diagnosis of gastroenteritis. She returned 
to the ED the following day with persistent nausea, vomiting, 
diarrhea, and abdominal cramping. At that time, her AST was 
1,712 IU/L, ALT 1,025 IU/L, total bilirubin 2.0 mg/dL, and 
INR 1.8 units. She was treated with aggressive IV fluid hydra-
tion, IV octreotide, and IV silibinin, as well as the placement 
of a biliary drain, but developed irreversible fulminant hepatic 
failure and underwent liver transplant on hospital day 4, with 
subsequent improvement of her hepatic function.
The family friend (patient F) visited an ED 2 days after 
ingestion of the mushrooms, complaining of abdominal pain, 
nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. On hospital day 1, her LFTs 
peaked at AST 11,940, ALT 11,350, and INR 4.5. She was 
treated with aggressive IV fluid hydration, IV octreotide, and 
IV silibinin. Her hepatic function recovered, and she was 
discharged home on hospital day 6.
Additional cases. In the subsequent 2 weeks, CPCS was 
notified of eight additional cases of acute liver injury after 
consumption of wild mushrooms in northern California 
counties (Table). One case involved a man aged 36 years who 
had ingested mushrooms, later confirmed to be A. phalloides, 
obtained from a friend who picked them during a hike. Another 
case occurred in a man aged 56 years who was evaluated at an 
ED 2 days after ingestion of foraged mushrooms and required 
a liver transplant; two cases occurred in women aged 86 and

hepatic function.
Discussion
Over the course of 2 weeks in December 2016, CPCS inves-
tigated 14 suspected A. phalloides ingestions in five northern 
California counties. Eleven patients recovered, although three 
required liver transplants because of irreversible fulminant 
hepatic failure. One of those patients, a child, developed 
cerebral edema and suffered permanent neurologic sequelae.
Amatoxins, consisting of alpha, beta, and gamma amanitin, 
account for >90% of deaths related to mushroom poisoning 
worldwide (1). A. phalloides contains the alpha variety of 
amanitin, a cyclic octapeptide thought to be the primary agent 
of toxicity in humans (2). The amanitins are heat stable and 
are not inactivated by cooking. Once ingested, amatoxin is 
readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract into the portal 
circulation where it is taken up by hepatocytes, binding to 
DNA-dependent RNA polymerase (II) and halting intracel-
lular protein synthesis, ultimately resulting in cell death (3). A 
lethal dose can be as low as 0.1 mg/kg, and a single mushroom 
can contain up to 15 mg (1). The clinical course of amatoxin 
poisoning is described in three phases: delayed gastroenteritis 
with significant body fluid volume loss (after a postingestion 
latency of 6–24 hours), symptomatic recovery (24–36 hours 
after ingestion), and fulminant hepatic and multiorgan failure 
(typically 3–5 days after the ingestion) (4). Patients who are 
evaluated early in the course of their illness might be discharged 
home only to return later with indications of liver failure, con-
tributing to the relatively high case fatality rate (10%–20%) 
(5,6). Initial treatment emphasizes early supportive care includ-
ing aggressive fluid and electrolyte replacement. In the event 
of irreversible fulminant liver failure, liver transplant might be 
required. A variety of therapies including multidose activated 
charcoal, high-dose penicillin, N-acetylcysteine, cimetidine, 
biliary drainage, and octreotide have been attempted with 
no definitive evidence of efficacy. Uncontrolled observational

studies of Amanita intoxication suggest that the early use of 
silibinin, a milk thistle derivative, is associated with a reduc-
tion in mortality when compared with historical controls (7); 
however, as with the other aforementioned therapies, evidence 
supporting efficacy is lacking because of difficulties associated 
with conducting randomized controlled trials. Intravenous 
silibinin is licensed in Europe, and a clinical trial to evaluate 
its efficacy in treatment of hepatic failure induced by Amanita 
mushroom poisoning is currently underway in the United 
States.§ The majority of silibinin-treated patients in this 
report received the drug as participants of this trial.¶ Medical 
providers should contact the regional poison control center or 
a medical toxicology consultant to assist in the management 
of any patient with suspected amatoxic mushroom ingestion.
In California, A. phalloides species grow in a symbiotic 
relationship with coast live oak and other hardwood trees 
(8). They can be especially abundant in the early wet winter 
months, though the foggy coastal climate and warmer tem-
peratures can support mushroom growth throughout the year 
(4). In 2016, local mycologists noted an abundance of wild 
mushroom growth, and California county health departments 
reported an increase in the incidence of mushroom poison-
ing (9). Although weather conditions and increased numbers 
of A. phalloides poisonings do not prove a cause and effect 
relationship, early seasonal rainfall and warmer subsequent 
temperatures made a substantial contribution to mushroom 
proliferation. In addition, a general increase in naïve foraging 
and wildcrafting (i.e., gathering plant material from its native 
environment for food or medicinal purposes) activities raises 
risk for poisoning.
Mycologists recommend exercising caution when forag-
ing or purchasing wild mushrooms for consumption. If wild 
mushrooms are to be consumed, specimens should first be 
examined, identified, and deemed edible by an experienced 
mycologist (4). Prompt identification of mushroom-related 
toxic symptoms in the ED and early, aggressive IV volume 
replacement are critical first steps in diminishing the significant 
morbidity and mortality associated with amatoxin ingestion. 
Antidotal therapies might also be considered in conjunction 
with a consultant experienced in hepatotoxic mushroom poi-
soning. In patients with severe poisoning, early contact with 
the nearest liver transplant center is recommended. Response 
to this outbreak included the notification of the local counties 
and state department of public health, which subsequently

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
Ingestion of Amanita phalloides is responsible for a majority of 
mushroom-related deaths worldwide. Amatoxins, the principal 
toxic alkaloids found in these fungi, cause cell injury by halting 
protein synthesis. A possible antidote licensed in most of 
Europe, intravenous silibinin, is undergoing evaluation by 
clinical trial in the United States.
What is added by this report?
In December 2016, fourteen cases of Amanita phalloides 
poisoning were identified by the California Poison Control System 
(CPCS) among persons who had consumed foraged wild 
mushrooms. In the past few years before this outbreak, CPCS only 
received reports of a few mushroom poisoning cases per year. All 
patients in this outbreak had gastrointestinal manifestations of 
intoxication leading to dehydration and hepatotoxicity. Three 
patients received liver transplants; all patients recovered, 
although one (a child) had permanent neurologic impairment.
What are the implications for public health practice?
Wild-picked mushrooms should be evaluated by a trained 
mycologist before ingestion. Inexperienced foragers should be 
strongly discouraged from eating any wild mushrooms. Health 
care providers should be aware of the potential for toxicity after 
wild mushroom ingestion, that gastrointestinal symptoms 
mimicking viral gastroenteritis can occur after ingestion and 
slowly progress to potentially fatal hepatotoxicity, and should 
contact the local poison center for reporting and assistance 
with management of these patients.
