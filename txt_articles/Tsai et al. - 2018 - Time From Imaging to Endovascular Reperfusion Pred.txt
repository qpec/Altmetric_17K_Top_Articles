Background and Purpose—This study aims to describe the relationship between computed tomographic (CT) perfusion 
(CTP)-to-reperfusion time and clinical and radiological outcomes, in a cohort of patients who achieve successful 
reperfusion for acute ischemic stroke.
Methods—We included data from the CRISP (Computed Tomographic Perfusion to Predict Response in Ischemic Stroke 
Project) in which all patients underwent a baseline CTP scan before endovascular therapy. Patients were included if they 
had a mismatch on their baseline CTP scan and achieved successful endovascular reperfusion. Patients with mismatch 
were categorized into target mismatch and malignant mismatch profiles, according to the volume of their Tmax >10s 
lesion volume (target mismatch, <100 mL; malignant mismatch, >100 mL). We investigated the impact of CTP-to-
reperfusion times on probability of achieving functional independence (modified Rankin Scale, 0–2) at day 90 and 
radiographic outcomes at day 5.
Results—Of 156 included patients, 108 (59%) had the target mismatch profile, and 48 (26%) had the malignant mismatch 
profile. In patients with the target mismatch profile, CTP-to-reperfusion time showed no association with functional 
independence (P=0.84), whereas in patients with malignant mismatch profile, CTP-to-reperfusion time was strongly 
associated with lower probability of functional independence (odds ratio, 0.08; P=0.003). Compared with patients with 
target mismatch, those with the malignant mismatch profile had significantly more infarct growth (90 [49–166] versus 43 
[18–81] mL; P=0.006) and larger final infarct volumes (110 [61–155] versus 48 [21–99] mL; P=0.001).
Conclusions—Compared with target mismatch patients, those with the malignant profile experience faster infarct growth and 
a steeper decline in the odds of functional independence, with longer delays between baseline imaging and reperfusion. 
However, this does not exclude the possibility of treatment benefit in patients with a malignant profile.

educing the time to reperfusion has become a major focus 
in the delivery of endovascular therapy for patients with 
acute ischemic stroke because time is a recognized predictor 
of clinical outcome.1–3 The HERMES collaboration (Highly 
Effective Reperfusion Evaluated in Multiple Endovascular 
Stroke Trials) and ESCAPE trial (Emphasis on Minimizing 
CT to Recanalization Times) have reported a decrease in the 
probability of good clinical outcome with longer time from 
qualifying neuroimaging to reperfusion.2,3 Although these data 
point to a general decrement in good outcome rates with longer 
imaging-to-reperfusion times, it is possible that patients have 
variable resilience to time delays and different time windows 
in which endovascular therapy provides clinical benefit.
In DEFUSE 2 (Diffusion and Perfusion Imaging Evaluation 
for Understanding Stroke Evolution 2), a patient cohort that 
maintained a high probability of functional independence over 
time was identifiable by the target perfusion–diffusion mis-
match on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).4 These patients 
have a small ischemic core on diffusion-weighted imaging, a 
large volume of critical hypoperfusion (time-to-maximum of the

residue function greater than 6 seconds, Tmax>6s), and a small 
volume of brain tissue with severe delays in bolus arrival (time-
to-maximum of the residue function greater than 10 seconds, 
Tmax>10s). In contrast, patients with large Tmax>10s lesions 
showed more infarct growth and worse clinical outcomes.5
The aim of this substudy of the CRISP (Computed 
Tomographic Perfusion to Predict Response in Ischemic Stroke 
Project) was to explore the relationship between time from 
imaging to reperfusion and clinical and radiological outcomes.6 
We hypothesized that the association between computed tomo-
graphic (CT) perfusion (CTP)-to-reperfusion time and the 
probability of functional independence is modified by the base-
line CTP profile. Specifically, we hypothesized that the effect of 
prolonged CTP-to-reperfusion time is more deleterious among 
patients with the malignant mismatch (a mismatch and a large 
Tmax>10s lesion) than among patients with the target mis-
match (a mismatch and a small Tmax>10s lesion).
Methods
The data that support the findings of this study are available on reason-
able request (from M.G.L. at lansberg@stanford.edu). CRISP was an 
National Institutes of Health-funded, multicenter, prospective cohort 
study to evaluate the role of CTP in patients undergoing endovascular 
therapy.6 In CRISP, all endovascular treatment and perioperative medical 
care decisions were at the discretion of the treating physicians. Clinical 
follow-up included National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score 
(NIHSS) and modified Rankin Scale (mRS) assessments at 24 hours, 
30 days, and 90 days after stroke. Two follow-up MRIs were required: 
early MRI was acquired within 36 (24±12) hours from the baseline CTP 
and included an magnetic resonance angiogram and perfusion-weighted 
imaging. A second MRI was done at day 5 after the baseline CTP (or 
on discharge, whichever occurred first) and included diffusion-weighted 
imaging, gradient echo/susceptibility-weighted imaging, and fluid-
attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequences. If any contraindica-
tions to MRI existed, a follow-up CTP was performed instead of MRI. 
Ethics approval was obtained from the institutional review board of all 
participating centers, and written informed consent was obtained before 
enrollment, from patients or their legally authorized representatives.
Study Population
Patients were eligible for CRISP if they had an acute large-vessel 
occlusion in the anterior circulation, were ≥18 years of age, had an 
NIHSS of ≥5, and could undergo CT angiography and perfusion 
imaging within 18 hours of symptom onset and within 90 minutes 
before the start of endovascular therapy. Patients with a baseline mRS 
>2 and pregnant patients were excluded. In this analysis, we included 
all patients with successful reperfusion who had evidence of salvage-
able tissue on baseline CTP imaging and divided them into 2 cohorts 
defined by the type of mismatch profile.
Definitions
Time of CTP was defined by the time of completion of the qualifying 
CTP sequence. Time of reperfusion was defined as the documented 
endovascular treatment completion time. CTP-to-reperfusion time 
was the number of hours between time of CTP and time of reperfu-
sion. The ischemic core was defined by a decrease in relative cerebral 
blood flow to <30% of normal. Hypoperfused tissue likely to infarct 
in absence of reperfusion was defined by a time-to-maximum of the 
residue function over 6 seconds (Tmax>6s). The CTP mismatch was 
defined as a cerebral blood flow core <70 mL and an absolute differ-
ence between the Tmax>6s and ischemic core volumes of >15 mL 
and a volume ratio of >1.8. CTP mismatch was further divided into 2 
perfusion profiles. Target mismatch was defined as a mismatch profile 
in which the Tmax>10s volume was ≤100 mL, whereas malignant 
mismatch had a Tmax>10s volume >100 mL.
Imaging Analysis
CRISP used the RAPID software (iSchemaView; Menlo Park, CA) at 
all sites for real-time processing of all CT and MR perfusion images. 
RAPID automatically segmented and quantified the volumes of the 
ischemic core, Tmax>6s, and Tmax>10s lesion volumes. All digitally 
subtracted angiography images were reviewed by an experienced 
neuroradiologist (M.P.M.). A modified thrombolysis in cerebral 
infarction score was assigned based on the final angiogram of the 
endovascular procedure. The final infarct volumes were assessed by a 
neuroradiologist who was blinded to clinical data, baseline imaging, 
and reperfusion status.
Reperfusion status was primarily determined by follow-up MR 
and CTP data. Successful reperfusion was defined as >50% reduction 
of the Tmax>6s lesion volumes between the baseline and the early 
follow-up perfusion studies. If neither study was technically adequate 
(excessive patient movement or failed contrast injection), reperfusion 
status was defined as a modified thrombolysis in cerebral infarction 
score of 2b or 3. Final infarct volume was outlined on day 5 FLAIR. 
Infarct growth was calculated as the difference between the infarct 
core on baseline CTP and the day 5 FLAIR.
Outcomes
The primary outcome for this analysis was independent functional out-
come, defined as an mRS of ≤2 at 90 days. If the 90-day mRS was 
unavailable, the 30-day mRS was carried forward. The NIHSS and mRS 
were rated by certified study personnel. The 90-day mRS—the primary 
clinical outcome—was rated blinded to imaging and reperfusion status.
Statistical Analysis
The association between CT-to-reperfusion time, as well as other 
baseline patient characteristics, and the probability of functional 
independence was determined using univariable logistic regression. 
Next, to adjust for potential confounders of the association between 
CT-to-reperfusion time and functional independence, variables sig-
nificant at the P<0.1 level in univariate analysis were entered into 
multivariable logistic regression models for patients with target mis-
match, malignant mismatch, and for all patients with mismatch. We 
also adjusted for significant interactions between variables included 
in the multivariable models and CT-to-reperfusion time. Infarct 
growth and final infarct volumes were compared between cohorts 
using Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Associations were deemed significant 
at an α <0.05. All statistical analyses were performed using SAS 9.4.
Results
Between October 2011 and November 2014, 201 patients were 
enrolled in CRISP, 171 of whom had a mismatch on baseline 
CTP. Seventeen (10%) patients did not achieve reperfusion and 
were excluded (Table I in the online-only Data Supplement). 
Therefore, this study includes 154 patients with mismatch on 
baseline CTP and successful reperfusion after endovascular 
thrombectomy: 108 (70%) who met criteria for target mis-
match profile and 46 (30%) for malignant mismatch profile. 
Other notable patient exclusions from this study are presented 
in Figure 1. Baseline patient characteristics are presented in 
Table 1 (Table II in the online-only Data Supplement).
Association Between CTP-to-Reperfusion Time 
and Probability of Functional Independence
In the overall cohort (n=154), age and baseline NIHSS were 
significantly associated with probability of functional inde-
pendence (Table 2). Longer CTP-to-reperfusion time did not 
show a significant association with functional independence, 
but there was a strong trend (odds ratio, 0.65; 95% confidence 
interval, 0.41–1.03; adjusted P=0.06; Figure 2).

Among patients with target mismatch profile, median 
CTP-to-reperfusion time was 1.8 (interquartile range [IQR], 
1.5–2.4) hours. There was no significant association between 
CTP-to-reperfusion time and the probability of functional 
independence in the univariable analysis or after adjustment 
for age, NIHSS, and core volume (odds ratio, 1.06; 95% con-
fidence interval, 0.59–1.90; adjusted P=0.84; Figure 3A). 
Among patients with malignant mismatch profile, median 
CTP-to-reperfusion time was 1.95 (IQR, 1.6–2.5) hours. In 
these patients, CTP-to-reperfusion time was significantly 
associated with lower odds of achieving functional indepen-
dence at 90 days (odds ratio, 0.08; 95% confidence interval, 
0.01–0.42; adjusted P=0.003). The probability of functional 
independence dropped rapidly from 75%, when the patient 
was reperfused within 30 minutes of CTP, to <40% if CTP-to-
reperfusion time exceeded 2 hours (Figure 3B).
Association Between Mismatch Profile 
and Radiological Outcomes
Day 5 FLAIR images were available for 75 (69%) patients 
with target mismatch and 24 (50%) patients with the malig-
nant mismatch profile. Patients with malignant mismatch had 
more infarct growth than those with target mismatch (90 [IQR, 
49–166] versus 43 [IQR, 18–81] mL; P=0.006). Despite simi-
lar baseline infarct core volumes and Alberta Stroke Program 
Early CT Scores, patients with malignant mismatch also had 
larger final infarct volumes (110 [IQR, 61–155] versus 48 
[IQR, 21–99] mL; P=0.001; Figure 4).
Discussion
This study demonstrates marked heterogeneity in the effect 
of CTP-to-reperfusion time on functional outcome after 
endovascular therapy. This analysis failed to detect an asso-
ciation between CTP-to-reperfusion time and the probability 
of recovering functional independence among patients with 
target mismatch on baseline CTP. Meanwhile, in patients 
with malignant mismatch, a longer CTP-to-reperfusion 
time was strongly associated with lower odds of functional 
independence.
We explored infarct growth as a physiologically plausible 
explanation for the discrepant effects of time between patients 
with target and malignant mismatch profiles. Compared with 
the target mismatch profile cohort, patients in the malignant 
mismatch cohort had more than double the infarct growth and 
final infarct volume, despite reperfusion. DEFUSE 2 showed 
similar findings with MRI perfusion–diffusion mismatch: 
malignant profiles on perfusion-weighted imaging were asso-
ciated with the most rapid infarct growth and less penumbral 
salvage.7 Using CTP, d’Esterre et al8 demonstrated that sever-
ity of perfusion delay is inversely related to the available time 
window to salvage the hypoperfused lesion from infarction. A 
Tmax threshold of ≥10 seconds also seemed to be optimal in 
predicting infarction, especially if reperfusion occurs beyond 
90 to 180 minutes after CTP.8 The malignant mismatch pro-
file thus seems to be a reliable biomarker of rapid progression 
to irreversible ischemic injury, predicting larger final infarcts 
and lower odds of regaining functional independence if timely 
reperfusion does not occur.
The effect of CT-to-reperfusion time on clinical outcome 
in our study is in keeping with previously published data, 
which support the external validity of our study.2,3 In our 
cohort of all patients with successful reperfusion, the asso-
ciation between CTP-to-reperfusion time and functional inde-
pendence was similar to the one reported in the HERMES 
meta-analysis.2 In CRISP and HERMES, the probability of

functional independence was >70% when reperfusion occurs 
within 1 hour of imaging and then drops to <40% at 4 hours.2 
In ESCAPE, this probability showed a more rapid decline, 
from almost 70% with reperfusion within 1 hour of imaging 
to <40% with reperfusion at 2.5 hours.3 Given the similarity 
in the overall populations of the ESCAPE trial, the HERMES 
collaboration, and the CRISP study, we propose that the target 
and malignant CTP mismatch profiles provide a further refine-
ment in predicting probability of functional independence.9
Our results do not imply that patients with a malignant 
mismatch profile on CTP should not undergo endovascular 
therapy. It is important to note that the probability of func-
tional independence with short imaging-to-reperfusion time 
is comparable between patients with the malignant and target 
mismatch profiles. This suggests that the effect of endovascu-
lar treatment may be similar in both populations if imaging-
to-reperfusion times are kept short. Also, our results do not 
imply that patients with target mismatch profile are immune 
to delays in reperfusion. Infarct growth, albeit at a slower 
rate, continues in absence of reperfusion. Although we were 
unable to demonstrate an effect of CTP-to-reperfusion time on

functional outcome in patients with target mismatch, it is prob-
able that a modest effect does exist, which we were underpow-
ered to demonstrate. It is also possible that an effect of time 
could have been demonstrated if our sample had included tar-
get mismatch patients with longer CTP-to-reperfusion times. 
Therefore, it should be stressed that, although patients with 
the malignant mismatch appear particularly sensitive to treat-
ment delays, early reperfusion will benefit all patients.
Limitations
Our study has limitations. First, in the absence of a con-
trol group, we can only determine the relationship between 
CT-to-reperfusion time and functional independence but not 
between CT-to-reperfusion time and the effect of endovascular 
treatment. Second, the relationship between CT-to-reperfusion 
time and functional independence may be influenced by vari-
ables other than CTP profile. Although we adjusted for poten-
tial confounders using multivariable analyses, it is possible 
that there were unknown confounders that were not adjusted 
for. Third, final infarct data were only available in a subset of 
case, although it unlikely affected the validity of the analy-
sis, because there was no known bias in missing imaging data 
between the target and malignant mismatch profile cohorts, 
and the imaging analyses remained sufficiently powered to 
demonstrate differences between the cohorts. Fourth, the 
infarct core in our study was defined as critically decreased 
cerebral blood flow, based on previous studies supporting its 
validity compared with a diffusion-weighted imaging–based 
Figure 3. Computed tomographic (CT) perfusion (CTP)-to-reperfusion time and probability of functional independence in patients with 
target and malignant mismatch profile. The regression curve estimates the probability of functional independence at 90 days for an aver-
age patient with mismatch who achieves successful reperfusion (mean age, 67 years; baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale 
score, 15.5; and baseline CTP infarct core volume, 9.3 mL). The shaded area corresponds to the 95% confidence interval. A, Patients 
with target mismatch profile reperfused within 18 hours from stroke onset. B, Patients with malignant mismatch profile reperfused within 
18 hours from stroke onset. For the average patient with mismatch, the probability of functional independence at 90 days rapidly drops 
<50% if reperfusion is not achieved within 2.5 hours from CTP
.

strated more than double the infarct growth and final infarct volume measured on day 5 fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR), despite

[IQR, 61–155] vs 48 [IQR, 21–99] mL; P=0.001). B, This subject had a relative cerebral blood flow (rCBF) core of 42 mL (pink), a Tmax>6s 
lesion of 162 mL (green), a Tmax>10s lesion of 110 mL (red), complete reperfusion at 24 hours, and a final infarct volume of 142 mL.

measure. An alternative definition of the ischemic core, such 
as one based on cerebral blood volume, may have resulted in 
a slightly different population with mismatch, but this would 
likely not have affected the overall results of the study.10,11 
Last, day 5 FLAIR likely overestimates the final infarct vol-
ume because of the presence of vasogenic edema, but because 
this effect is present in both groups, it is unlikely to have 
affected the results of the analyses.
Conclusions
Time delay between baseline imaging and endovascular reper-
fusion have discrepant effects depending on patients’ baseline 
mismatch profile. Patients with a malignant mismatch, char-
acterized by a large territory of severely delayed contrast 
arrival, have a rapid decline in their chance of functional inde-
pendence with longer delays, whereas patients with a target 
mismatch are relatively resilient, yet likely not immune to 
such treatment delays. Our results do not indicate a lack of 
treatment effect among patients with the malignant profile. 
However, they suggest that the treatment effect may be greater 
with shorter imaging-to-reperfusion times, particularly in 
patients with a malignant mismatch profile.
