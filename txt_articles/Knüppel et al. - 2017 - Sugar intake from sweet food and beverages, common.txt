and beverages, common 
mental disorder and depression: 
prospective findings from the 
Whitehall II study

Intake of sweet food, beverages and added sugars has been linked with depressive symptoms in several 
populations. Aim of this study was to investigate systematically cross-sectional and prospective 
associations between sweet food/beverage intake, common mental disorder (CMD) and depression and 
to examine the role of reverse causation (influence of mood on intake) as potential explanation for the 
observed linkage. We analysed repeated measures (23,245 person-observations) from the Whitehall II 
study using random effects regression. Diet was assessed using food frequency questionnaires, mood 
using validated questionnaires. Cross-sectional analyses showed positive associations. In prospective 
analyses, men in the highest tertile of sugar intake from sweet food/beverages had a 23% increased 
odds of incident CMD after 5 years (95% CI: 1.02, 1.48) independent of health behaviours, socio-
demographic and diet-related factors, adiposity and other diseases. The odds of recurrent depression 
were increased in the highest tertile for both sexes, but not statistically significant when diet-related 
factors were included in the model (OR 1.47; 95% CI: 0.98, 2.22). Neither CMD nor depression predicted 
intake changes. Our research confirms an adverse effect of sugar intake from sweet food/beverage on 
long-term psychological health and suggests that lower intake of sugar may be associated with better 
psychological health.
Sugar consumption is increasingly discussed as an intervention target to reduce prevalence of obesity, diabetes 
and other non-communicable diseases1, 2. In Britain, adults consume approximately double, and in the U.S. triple, 
the recommended level of added sugar for additional health benefits (5% of energy intake), with sweet foods and 
drinks contributing three-quarters of the intake1, 3, 4. Meanwhile, major depression is predicted to become the 
leading cause of disability in high income countries by 20305.
Higher sugar consumption was linked to higher depression prevalence in several ecological and cross-sectional 
studies6–8. To date, few studies have investigated the prospective association of sweet food and beverage intake 
with depression9–12. Although all studies found an increased risk of depression with higher baseline consumption 
of added sugars, soft drinks, juices and pastries; none examined the role of ‘reverse causation’ in producing the 
observed association. Reverse causation refers, in this context, to the possibility that a mood disorder may lead to 
higher sugar intake, so that the diet-mental health association is wholly or partly the result of poor mental health 
rather than of high sugar intake13–15. A prospective study with repeat measures of food intake and mental health 
provides the opportunity to examine the bidirectional nature of the association, and to contribute novel evidence 
on the effect of sugar dense diet on depression in the general population.
There are several plausible biological explanations for an association of habitual sugar intake and subsequent 
risk of depression, in the long-term. Firstly, low levels of the growth factor brain derived neurotrophic factor 
(BDNF) have been discussed as facilitating neurogenesis and hippocampal atrophy in depression16. Rodents 
fed high-fat high-sugar diets, but not high-fat diets only, show a decrease in BDNF level17–19, which could be 
a mechanistic link between diets high in sugar and depression. Secondly, carbohydrate consumption has been

associated with increased circulating inflammatory markers, which may depress mood20, 21. Thirdly, high sugar 
diets could induce hypoglycaemia through an exaggerated insulin response and thereby influence hormone levels 
and potentially mood states22. Fourthly, addiction-like effects of sugar suggest dopaminergic neurotransmission 
mechanisms might connect frequent sugar intake with depression23–25. Lastly, obesity could be a mediating factor 
between a sugar-dense diet and depression26, 27 not only via inflammatory but also psychosocial factors like weight 
discrimination28.
The aim of this study is to investigate whether sugar intake from sweet food/beverages is positively associated 
with the risk of both incident and recurrent mood disorders, and to establish the role of the reverse effect in the 
Whitehall II cohort, using prospective, repeat measures data collected over a 22 year period.
Methods
Study cohort. 
The Whitehall Study II consists of non-industrial civil servants, who were recruited in London 
at age 35 to 55 years during 1985–1988 (phase 1). The initial sample size was 10,308 individuals (33.1% female 
and 66.9% male). The participants were followed up via questionnaire in 1989–1990 (phase 2), 1991–1993 (phase 
3), 1995–1996 (phase 4), 1997–1999 (phase 5), 2001 (phase 6), 2003–2004 (phase 7), 2006 (phase 8), 2008–2009 
(phase 9) and 2012–2013 (phase 11). In phases 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 and 11 they were additionally invited for screening in 
a research clinic29. Phase 10 (2011) consisted of a smaller sample of participants used for a pilot study. The study 
was approved by the Joint UCL/UCLH Committee on the Ethics of Human Research and carried out in accord-
ance with the ethical principles set out in the Declaration of Helsinki. Further all participants have been asked for 
informed consent at every follow-up.
Ascertainment of sugar intake from sweet food/beverages. 
Diet was assessed at phases 3, 5, 7 and 
9 using a 127-item machine-readable semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) which originates 
from the tool used in the US Nurses’ Health Study, a self-administered questionnaire on habitual diet over the 
past 12 months30, 31. In order to reflect most diets in the UK it has been modified and anglicized32. This FFQ has 
been validated against a 7 day diet diary in a stratified random sample of 865 participants in the Whitehall Study 
II at collection phase 330. Sweet food and beverage intake was measured with 15 items such as cakes, biscuits, 
added sugar to coffee or tea, and fizzy soft drinks (see Supplementary Table S1). Sugar intake was calculated by 
multiplying sweet food/beverage consumption frequencies per day by their sugar content and portion size based 
on McCance and Widdowson’s The Composition of Foods, 5th edition33.
Depressive symptom assessment. 
The 30-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ) measures depres-
sive and somatic symptoms over the past two weeks34. Caseness was defined as reporting ≥
5 symptoms and is 
referred to as common mental disorder (CMD). This measure was included in follow-up questionnaires at all 
phases apart from phase 4. In addition, the 20-item Center of Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D), 
a self-report measure of depressive symptoms in the general population over the past week35, was administered 
at phases 7, 9 and 11. Individuals scoring ≥
16 were considered cases of depression36. Lastly, a clinical interview 
using the Revised Clinical Interview Schedule (CIS-R) was administered at phase 11 with participants assessed 
according to International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) F32 criteria. The computerized self-completion 
version of the CIS-R included questions on depressive symptoms that were present for at least 2 weeks37–39. The 
GHQ and CES-D have been validated against the CIS-R in this cohort and showed high sensitivity and specificity 
in measuring depressive episodes39.
Covariates. 
Potential confounders were chosen based on review of the literature and restricted to variables 
available at all phases used in the analyses. All estimates were initially adjusted for age, ethnicity (White/ South 
Asian/ Black) and sex, with an interaction of sex and age where both sexes included. Socio-demographic variables 
consisted of marital status (married/cohabiting, single or divorced/widowed) and last employment grade level 
within the civil service, (high, intermediate, low). Health behaviours included smoking (never, former, current), 
alcohol intake (none: ≤
1 unit/weeks, moderate, heavy: ≥
14 units/week) self-reported physical activity (vigorous, 
moderate and non/mild)40 and duration of sleep (5 categories from ≤
5 hours to ≥
9 hours/day). Diet-related fac-
tors comprised energy intake, diet quality, fish, coffee and tea intake based on FFQ data. Energy intake was used 
to ascertain dietary misreporting. Misreporting was considered where the log ratio of energy intake to estimated 
energy expenditure was outside of 3 SD of the log mean. This definition was adopted by Mosdol et al. 2007 and 
based on basal metabolic rate equations of the Department of Health41–43. Since sugar intake from sweet food/
beverages was strongly correlated with energy intake (r = 0.61, P < 0.001), energy intake was adjusted for with 
the partition method by using energy intake from other foods44. Diet quality was assessed using the Dietary 
Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet score modified by excluding a measure for sweet drinks45. DASH 
diet score, coffee and tea intake were analysed as continuous variables, fish intake per day as quintiles and all 
dichotomized for descriptive analyses. Body mass index (BMI) (kg/m2) and central obesity (in women waist 
circumference ≥
88 cm and in men ≥
102 cm) were both measured by trained staff46. Physical health was defined 
as diabetes and cardiovascular disease (coronary heart disease and stroke, CVD) based on self-reports which 
were validated using the study clinical examination, Hospital Episode Statistics data, and by contacting general 
practitioners for confirmation when no other external source existed. Cancer was based on cancer registration 
data29. Finally, doctor diagnosis of depression was based on self-report at phases 1 to 4 and on self-reported anti-
depressant intake at all phases after phase 4.
Statistical analysis. 
At each phase, participants were included if they had answered at least 8 of the FFQ 
sweet food and beverage items47 (less than 5% of eligible sample had one missing item and about 1% two or 
more), their ethnicity was known to be either White, Black or South Asian, and participants were not energy 
misreporters (see above). In addition, participants were also excluded from analyses if they had incomplete data

on GHQ-, CES-D- or CIS-R caseness for outcome-specific analyses, respectively. Supplementary Fig. S1 shows 
how the included sample was reached (see Online).
Three binary outcomes were analysed, GHQ caseness, CES-D caseness and CIS-R caseness. Daily sweet food 
and beverage intake was modelled as sex-specific tertiles of sugar intake from sweet food/beverages based on the 
distribution at phase 3 (in men <39.5, ≥
39.5 to <67.0 and ≥
67.0 g/day; in women <30.0, ≥
30.0 to <51.0 and 
≥
51.0 g/day). To describe the sample at phase 3, GHQ cases, non-cases and tertiles of sugar intake by covariate 
were compared. To examine the prospective association of sugar intake from sweet food and beverages, a random 
effects logistic regression model (REM) was performed using the STATA command xtlogit48, with exposures at 
phases 3, 5, 7 and 9 for GHQ caseness, and at phases 7 and 9 for CES-D caseness. The applicability of the REM was 
tested by introducing study phase-interactions and likelihood ratio tests (LRT). The prospective effect of sugar 
intake from sweet food/beverages on incident and recurrent CMD and depression was examined using REMs in 
2, 5 and 10-year cycles49. Figure 1 shows the included phases for analyses using GHQ caseness as the outcome. 
For example, the association between sugar intake and GHQ status 2 years later was conducted by combining the 
associations between sugar intake at Phase 5 and incident GHQ caseness at Phase 6, and between sugar intake at 
Phase 7 and incident GHQ caseness at Phase 8. For all depression outcomes, incidence was assumed if no CMD 
was apparent at each baseline, and recurrence if CMD was apparent at each baseline. For the analyses of depres-
sion, two 5-year cycles (to Phase 9 and 11) and three 10 year cycles (to Phases 7, 9 and 11) were used. For clinical 
depression, one 5-year cycle and one 10-year cycle were used.
To check for reverse causation, that depressive symptoms may affect subsequent sugar intake from sweet food/
beverages, linear regression models of 5-year change and multinomial logistic regression for change groups were 
fitted for each cycle, from phases 3 to 5, 5 to 7 and 7 to 9, with CMD at phases 3, 5, 7 respectively, and for change 
from phase 7 to 9 with depression at phase 7. Normal distribution of change in sugar intake from sweet food/
beverages was verified using a histogram. Change groups were created by subtracting tertiles of sugar intake at 
baseline (t) from sugar intake from sweet food/beverages at follow-up (t + 5 y) and coding −
2/−
1 as decrease, 0 
as no change and +1/+2 as increase in sugar intake from sweet food/beverages.
All analyses were performed using Stata 1450. Interactions of CMD and depression with sex in the initial model 
(Model 0 per sex-specific tertile trend: adjusted for age and ethnicity) were tested using LRT since sex-differences 
have been reported in a prior study on the association of diet and depression in the Whitehall II cohort51. Further 
adjustments were grouped into four hierarchical models: baseline socio-demographic factors and health behav-
iours (Model 1), diet-related factors (Model 2), BMI and central obesity (Model 3), and physical health (Model 
4). In sensitivity analyses, main analyses were repeated by: (a) excluding participants with unknown or reported 
doctor diagnosis of depression at each baseline (at phases 3/5/7/9: 166/156/193/209 individuals) and: (b) exclud-
ing participants with extreme values of sugar intake (>7 SD) at phases 3/5/7/9: 5/3/4/4 individuals.
Results
Table 1 shows the prevalence of CMD and tertiles of reported sugar consumption from sweet food/beverages 
according to covariates at phase 3. CMD was more prevalent in women: under 50-years old, divorced/widowed, 
physically inactive, current smokers and those with fewer hours of sleep. Women with CMD were more likely 
to be in a lower grade level in civil service (P < 0.001; not depicted). Sugar consumption was associated with 
socio-demographic factors, health behaviours, physical health and diet-related factors (Table 1). Unexpectedly, 
participants in the highest tertile of sweet food/beverage intake had the highest prevalence of normal weight and 
lowest prevalence of overweight and obesity as well as the lowest prevalence of abdominal obesity in men (both 
P = 0.002; not depicted).
Incidence of CMD was around 9 to 15%, highest in the first cycle but did not differ greatly by cycle length. 
Depression and clinical depression incidence were approximately 8% and 2%, respectively. About 44% of par-
ticipants who were CMD cases at baseline of each cycle remained recurrent CMD cases, 47% became recurrent 
depression cases and 58% recurrent clinical depression cases.

Cross-sectional results. 
Cross-sectional analyses showed strong positive associations between sugar intake 
from sweet food/beverages and common mental disorder from the GHQ, as well as CES-D caseness, when 
adjusted for age, sex and ethnicity (Table 2). There was no evidence for any interaction with sex (P = 0.8 for GHQ 
and P = 0.7 for CES-D). The association with CMD was robust whereas for depression it was removed on adjust-
ment for socio-demographic factors, health behaviours and diet-related factors (Table 2). Further adjustments for 
central obesity and physical health (not shown), exclusion of 709 person-observations (377 in CES-D analysis) 
with reported doctor diagnosis of depression and person-observations with extreme values of sugar intake at 
baseline did not change the results.
Prospective results. 
Prospective analyses regarding incident CMD were stratified by sex, since interactions 
with sex were observed in the 5 years later model (LR test for sex interaction: GHQ 2 years later, P = 0.26: GHQ 5 
years later, P = 0.05). In women, no associations were found for incident CMD with tertiles of sugar intake from 
sweet food/beverages (after 2 years, highest vs. lowest tertile OR: 0.98; 95% CI 0.72, 1.34; P for tertile trend = 0.90; 
after 5 years, highest vs. lowest tertile OR: 0.94; 95% CI 0.74, 1.19; P for tertile trend = 0.59). In men, after 
adjustment for age and ethnicity, sugar intake was associated with incident CMD 2 and 5 years later (Table 3). 
In further models, the association with 2-year incidence attenuated but the association with 5-year incidence 
remained (Table 3) and further adjustments for BMI, central obesity and physical health (not shown) resulted 
in an OR for highest vs. lowest tertile of: 1.23, 95% CI: 1.02, 1.48, P for trend = 0.03. Excluding participants who 
reported a doctor diagnosis of depression at each baseline strengthened the association (Model 4 for CMD after 
5 years, Person observations = 10944; highest vs. lowest tertile OR; 1.25; 95% CI 1.03, 1.50; P for trend = 0.02,

Supplementary Table S2) and exclusion of person observations with extremely high sugar intakes did not affect 
the results. In men and women, no association between sugar intake from sweet food/beverages and incident 
depression or clinical depression 5 years later was observed (Model 0, highest vs. lowest tertile OR, depression 
0.92; 95% CI: 0.71, 1.18; P for tertile trend = 0.44; clinical depression: 0.95; 95% CI: 0.51, 1.75; P for trend = 0.84). 
The same exposure contrast was not associated with incident CMD or depression caseness after 10 years (Model 
0, highest vs. lowest tertile OR: 1.10; 95% CI: 0.92, 1.31; P for tertile trend = 0.31; and 1.17; 95% CI: 0.91, 1.50, 
P for tertile trend = 0.25, respectively). However, sugar intake was positively associated with incident clinical 
depression after 10 years in men (Model 2 Person observations = 2572, cases = 35; P for tertile trend = 0.67), but 
negatively in women (Person observations = 848, cases = 28; P for tertile trend = 0.02).
Prospective analyses regarding the associations of sugar intake from sweet food/beverages and recurrent 
mood disorders showed no evidence for sex interaction for CMD, CES-D depression or clinical depression 5 
years later. Sugar intake from sweet food/beverages was positively associated with recurrent depression after 5 
years (Model 0, highest vs. lowest tertile OR: 1.81; 95% CI: 1.23, 2.66; P for tertile trend = 0.003, Table 4). The 
association was attenuated when adjusted for other diet-related factors. Moreover, there was some evidence that 
sugar intake from sweet food/beverages was associated with recurrent clinical depression in both sexes combined 
(highest vs. lowest tertile OR: 1.66; 95% CI: 0.96, 2.87 and P for tertile trend = 0.07) when adjusted for age, sex 
and ethnicity (Supplementary Table S3). This association attenuated when further factors were introduced to the 
model. No statistically significant association was found for sugar intake from sweet food/beverages and recurrent 
GHQ caseness after 2 and 5 years (Model 0 for CMD after 2 years, highest vs. lowest tertile OR: 1.05; 95% CI 0.76, 
1.45; P for tertile trend = 0.83; for CMD after 5 years: 1.16; 95% CI 0.93, 1.46; P for tertile trend = 0.20).
Analyses of recurrent CMD, depression and recurrent clinical depression after 10 years showed no associa-
tions with sugar intake from sweet food/beverages.
Sensitivity analyses excluding extreme values of sugar intake and excluding person-observations with 
self-reported doctor diagnosis at baseline attenuated the association of sugar intake from sweet food/beverages 
and recurrent depression slightly (before P for tertile trend 0.003 after 0.022 and 0.010, respectively). Similarly, 
associations with clinical depression weakened when participants with depression diagnosis at baseline were 
excluded (Model 0, Person observations = 573; cases = 78; P for tertile trend = 0.17).
Analysis of reverse causation. 
Sugar intake from sweet food/beverages decreased by 2.00 (SD 28.8; 95% 
CI 1.20, 2.79) grams per day from phase 3 to 5, by 3.44 (SD 28.0; 95% CI 2.59, 4.30) grams from phase 5 to 7 and 
by 1.57 (SD 26.0; 95% CI 0.91, 2.33) grams from phase 7 to 9, and was normally distributed. Mean 5-year change 
was approximately 31 g sugar from sweet food/beverages per day in the decrease group, −
0.7 g in the stable intake 
group and 29 g in the increase group. Neither CMD, nor depression predicted 5-year changes in sugar intake 
(Table 5).
Discussion
The present long-term prospective study is the first to investigate the association of sugar consumption from 
sweet food/beverages with prevalent, incident and recurrent mood disorders, while also examining the effect

these disorders might have on subsequent habitual sugar intake. We found an adverse effect of higher sugar 
intake on mental health cross-sectionally and 5 years later in a study based on 23,245 repeated measures in men 
and women aged between 39 and 83. Further, we found an increased likelihood for incident CMD in men and 
some evidence of recurrent depression in both sexes with higher intakes of sugar from sweet food/beverages. 
These associations with incident CMD could not be explained by socio-demo graphic factors, other diet-related 
factors, adiposity and other diseases although the association with recurrent depression was explained by other 
diet-related factors.
In our study we were able to exclude potential ‘reverse causation’ as the reason for the observed link between 
high sugar intake and low mood. Over years and decades, it could be that those susceptible to depression tend 
to increase their sugar intake. This group may tend to report higher consumption at study baseline even in the 
absence of depression at the time of the questionnaire, while having an increased risk of future depression com-
pared to other participants14, 15. However, there was no support for this alternative hypothesis, since the observed 
associations in our analysis were not the result of secondary changes in consumption of sugary food and drinks. 
Our study findings are consistent with the hypothesis that high sugar intake plays a causal role in the risks of both 
incident and recurrent depression and CMD.
Higher sugar intake from sweet food/beverages was associated with increased likelihood of incident CMD 
after 5 years in men. The association in men was in line with results from previous prospective studies in 
American and Spanish cohorts9–11. There are several potential explanations for the observed sex differences. First, 
the associations in men for incident CMD show a stronger effect with a bigger sample (comparing analysis of 
2-year CMD with 5-year CMD), suggesting the lower number of female participants in our sample could have 
impaired the power of the analysis. Second, the results might reflect differences in pathways of depression by 
sex and type of depressive symptomatology52–54. Third, differences could be due to limitations of the study or to 
chance.
As described in the Introduction there are four potential mechanisms for an association of habitual sugar intake 
and subsequent depression risk. Sugar intake could increase depression risk over its potential influence on BDNF 
levels16 and inflammation20 which are both discussed as potential biological explanations for depression17, 21. 
Furthermore postprandial hypoglycaemia22 and addiction-like effects of sugar influencing neurotransmitters23–25 
could link sugar intake with low mood. The pathway of postprandial hypoglycaemia is also relevant in the con-
text of Glycaemic index, which has been shown to be associated with depression prevalence and incidence55, 56. 
However, it is a complex issue to tease apart the effects of a single nutrient in epidemiological studies since foods 
represent a mix of macro- and micronutrients. In this study associations were attenuated when adjusted for 
diet-related factors providing evidence of confounding and suggesting that the effect of sugar intake from sweet 
food/beverages could be partly explained by other components of the diet. Also, given that we analysed sugar 
intake from aggregated sweet foods and beverages we cannot rule out that certain types of foods and their par-
ticular components such as saturated fat content may have affected our findings. In our analysis, the association of 
sugar intake and recurrent depression was attenuated by measures of body fatness in participants without doctor 
diagnosis of depression at baseline supporting the hypothesis of an indirect effect mediated by adiposity26–28 driv-
ing the association of sugar intake and recurrent depression.
Meanwhile, there are several sources of possible error. Our study was based on an occupational cohort but 
sugar intakes from sweet food/beverages were close to those reported previously in a representative cohort in the 
UK (approximately 40 grams), and Batty et al. showed that effects found in Whitehall II were comparable to those 
observed in population-representative cohorts3, 57. A major limitation was the use of FFQ to derive diet data. FFQ 
data is subject to misreporting and underreporting, which have been found to differ by food group, depressive 
mood and BMI58–60. As reported previously in Whitehall, we showed a clear trend of lower sugar intake with 
higher BMI in men60. Nutrient content was based on food composition tables from 1991 and has to be considered

as a source of error, since food composition especially of highly processed food is likely to change over the course 
of 18 years. In this long-term follow-up study, sugar intake from sweet food/beverages, which are consistently 
high in sugar content, has been used as the exposure measure. Compared to a measure of intake that includes 
processed foods61, this method may involve less information bias. Furthermore, this FFQ is meant to reflect 
habitual diet over the course of a year and therefore might not pick up short-term diet changes or occasional binge 
eating30. Although we adjusted for a number of potential confounders, we cannot rule out residual confounding 
through unknown or unmeasured factors. Finally, not all depression measures were obtained in all phases and 
selective dropout due to depressive symptoms might have influenced case numbers62.
In conclusion, our study provides evidence that sugar intake from sweet food/beverages increases the chance 
of incident mood disorders in men and limited evidence regarding recurrent mood disorders in both sexes. With 
a high prevalence of mood disorders, and sugar intake commonly two to three times the level recommended, 
our findings indicate that policies promoting the reduction of sugar intake could additionally support primary 
and secondary prevention of depression. To elucidate the association further, especially regarding observed sex 
differences our study should be replicated in representative prospective cohorts.
