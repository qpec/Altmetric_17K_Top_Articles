Abstract The HIV capsid is semipermeable and covered in electropositive pores that are
essential for viral DNA synthesis and infection. Here, we show that these pores bind the abundant
cellular polyanion IP6, transforming viral stability from minutes to hours and allowing newly
synthesised DNA to accumulate inside the capsid. An arginine ring within the pore coordinates IP6,
which strengthens capsid hexamers by almost 10˚C. Single molecule measurements demonstrate
that this renders native HIV capsids highly stable and protected from spontaneous collapse.
Moreover, encapsidated reverse transcription assays reveal that, once stabilised by IP6, the
accumulation of new viral DNA inside the capsid increases >100 fold. Remarkably, isotopic labelling
of inositol in virus-producing cells reveals that HIV selectively packages over 300 IP6 molecules per
infectious virion. We propose that HIV recruits IP6 to regulate capsid stability and uncoating,
analogous to picornavirus pocket factors. HIV-1/IP6/capsid/co-factor/reverse transcription.

Introduction
Despite a wealth of assays and data, HIV post-entry biology remains poorly understood. Before the
virus can integrate its genes into the host genome, it must reverse transcribe its RNA into DNA,
travel to the nucleus, remove its protective capsid (uncoating) and target actively transcribing chro-
matin. However, the relationship between these processes and the order and location in which they
occur remain hotly debated. Reverse transcription (RT) is the first enzymatic step in infection and
likely occurs as soon as the viral capsid enters the cytosol. Evidence suggests that it precedes all
other processes including uncoating and nuclear import. Depletion of dynein (Fernandez et al.,
2015) and kinesin one heavy chain (KIF5B) (Lukic et al., 2014), required for mechanical transport of
viral cores to the nucleus, delays uncoating and nuclear entry but does not affect RT. Moreover,
none of the capsid cofactors required for nuclear entry or integration are necessary for RT. Depletion
of Nup153, Nup358, CPSF6 or TNPO3 inhibits nuclear entry and/or active chromatin targeting but
not RT (Marini et al., 2015; Matreyek and Engelman, 2011; Matreyek et al., 2013; Zhang et al.,
2010; Sowd et al., 2016; Ocwieja et al., 2011). Capsid mutants at cofactor interfaces largely phe-
nocopy cofactor dependence, reinforcing this notion. Mutants N57A, N74D and P90A have

 defective integration and/or infectivity in primary human macrophages (Ambrose et al., 2012;
Rasaiyaah et al., 2013; Schaller et al., 2011) but can still synthesise DNA.
The critical role the capsid plays in cellular trafficking and nuclear entry strongly suggests that it
remains intact in some form until late in post-entry. Inducing premature uncoating in the cell via the
restriction factor TRIM5a and the proteasome (Stremlau et al., 2006), or the capsid drug PF74, irre-
versibly blocks RT and inhibits infection (Price et al., 2014; Shi et al., 2011). Exactly where and
when uncoating normally happens and whether this occurs in a single step, or in sequential partial
uncoating steps, is unclear. Nevertheless, one implication of RT preceding all other steps is that
complete uncoating cannot be immediate. Encapsidated reverse transcription (ERT) assays demon-
strate that RT can take place inside purified HIV cores before uncoating when they are supplied with
dNTPs (Warrilow et al., 2007). Inside the viral capsid, RT enjoys a high enzyme and substrate con-
centration and synthesised DNA is protected from nucleic acid sensors and nucleases in the
cytosol (Rasaiyaah et al., 2013; Lahaye et al., 2013). While the benefits of remaining encapsidated
are clear, HIV capsids are known to be highly fragile in vitro (Forshey et al., 2002) and the accumu-
lation of newly synthesised DNA increases their instability (Rankovic et al., 2017). In contrast, it
takes at least 10 hr for the virus to complete RT (Butler et al., 2001) and dock at the
nucleus (Arhel et al., 2007).
Recently, we reported that HIV capsid hexamers possess an electropositive pore that is essential
for RT and infection (Jacques et al., 2016). A ring of arginine residues (R18) within the pore avidly
binds dNTPs, potentially explaining nucleotide transport into the capsid interior to fuel RT. However,
the properties of the R18 pore and its consequences for encapsidated DNA synthesis and capsid sta-
bility remain largely unexplored. Crucially, dNTP is not the only polyanion in the cell nor the most
abundant. Here, we show that the highly charged polyanion IP6 is specifically incorporated into HIV
virions and directly binds the R18 hexamer ring. We demonstrate that IP6 greatly stabilises HIV
eLife digest Viruses like HIV invade cells and replicate their genome to create new viruses. To
hide from components of our immune system that are active inside the cell, HIV uses a protein shell
called a capsid, which protects its genome from detection and destruction. However, the capsid
faces an engineering challenge beyond those faced by even the most complex man-made
structures. This is because the capsid must be strong enough to survive for hours inside the cell but
not so strong that it cannot quickly open when the virus needs to release its genome. How this
process, called ‘uncoating’, is achieved is one of the great unanswered questions in HIV biology.
In 2016, researchers made the unexpected discovery that the HIV capsid is decorated with
hundreds of pores: one at the center of every subunit from which it is built. Each pore contains a
ring of six positively charged amino acids that should destabilize the capsid and cause it to break
apart. Yet similar pores are found on a diverse range of viruses.
Mallery et al. – who include several of the researchers involved in the 2016 work – set out to
investigate why the HIV capsid contains the positively charged pores. Initial experiments revealed
that a molecule called IP6, which is abundant in cells, can bind to the HIV capsid. To do so, six
negatively charged phosphate groups in IP6 match up with the six positively charged residues in the
pore.
In a related study, Ma
´rquez et al. developed a new method that allows the fate of individual
capsids to be visualized through time. Here, Mallery et al. use the method to show that IP6 increases
how long the capsid remains intact from several minutes to over 10 hours. This allows HIV to copy its
genome inside the capsid, meaning it remains protected while the virus prepares to produce new
viruses. Mallery et al. also show that HIV packages more than 300 IP6 molecules into itself when it
replicates.
Other viruses called picornaviruses use small molecules called pocket factors to stabilize the
capsid and to trigger uncoating. Mallery et al. propose that IP6 is an HIV pocket factor. Just as
studies of pocket factors have stimulated the development of anti-picornavirus drugs, understanding
the role of IP6 may help to develop new treatments for HIV.

 cores, limiting their spontaneous disassembly and allowing efficient encapsidated RT. We propose
that HIV uses IP6 to regulate capsid uncoating in a manner reminiscent of picornavirus pocket
factors.
Results
ATP binds the HIV-1 capsid but does not inhibit ERT
Our previous study on HIV capsid pores suggested but did not determine that they are unable to
discriminate between ribo and deoxyribo nucleotides. This is an important question because ATP is
typically present at cytosolic concentrations > 100 fold in excess of dNTPs and thus a potential com-
petitor for dNTP recruitment by the capsid. We therefore investigated whether ATP competes with
dNTPs for binding to HIV capsid hexamers and whether the pore can discriminate between them.
We used differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF) to determine if ATP binds hexamers by testing for
thermal stabilisation, as was previously observed for dNTPs (Jacques et al., 2016). As previously, we
used a mutant hexamer protein that is coordinated by disulphide bridges between monomers
through the introduction of mutations A14C and E45C and with additional dimerisation mutants
W184A and M185A (Pornillos et al., 2010). ATP stabilised hexamers with an almost identical
increase in melting temperature (Tm) as dATP (Figure 1a). Moreover, other triphosphate ligands
were also stabilising suggesting a shared mode of binding. Next, we solved a crystal structure of
hexamer bound to ATP to determine its mode of binding (Table 1). We observed electron density

 indicating that ATP binds to hexamer at the centre of the sixfold axis and refinement of the six sym-
metrically equivalent ATP molecules with equal partial occupancy provided a good fit to the data
(Figure 1b,c). The structure shows that ATP is coordinated solely by the R18 ring confirming that
hexamers do not discriminate ribo versus deoxyribo nucleotides (Figure 1d,e).
As capsid hexamers do not discriminate NTPs and dNTPs, we tested how the presence of ATP
impacts on ERT. ERT reactions were carried out on capsid cores purified from HIV-1 virions by centri-
fugation through a triton layer and banding in a sucrose gradient (Shah and Aiken, 2011). To ensure
that this procedure allows recovery of intact cores of the expected morphology, we carried out neg-
ative stain electron microscopy (EM) on capsid cores further concentrated by pelleting. We observed
intact capsids similar to those described previously (Welker et al., 2000) (Figure 2a). We investi-
gated RT inside these cores by adding dNTPs, together with DNAse to remove DNA accumulating
outside the capsid. Surprisingly, even at a 100-fold excess of ATP over dNTPs, not only did ATP fail
to inhibit ERT but it actually increased the quantity of measured transcripts (Figure 2b). Similar
increases were observed with the non-hydrolysable analogue ATPgS, suggesting that this was not
due to an undefined ATPase activity. Improvement in ERT efficiency was dose-dependent, with tran-
scripts increasing over two orders of magnitude as ATP was increased from 10 to 1000 mM
(Figure 2c). Importantly, ATP had no impact on the activity of purified RT enzyme alone over the
same concentration range (Figure 2d). Furthermore, substantial ATP stimulation was only observed

 in ERT reactions carried out in the presence of nuclease (Figure 2e). In the presence of DNase, any
RT products that are made outside of the capsid, or become exposed as a result of uncoating, will
be degraded. Thus, ATP does not alter the efficiency of RT directly but facilitates the accumulation
of RT products within intact capsids. This is consistent with the fact that ATP hydrolysis is not
required, as shown by the ATPgS data. We hypothesised that the ability of ATP to stabilise hexam-
ers, as measured by DSF, may increase capsid stability during ERT. Consistent with this hypothesis,
ATP only promoted ERT at concentrations of dNTPs < 100 mM (Figure 2f). At higher dNTP concen-
trations, ATP presumably had no effect because dNTPs sufficiently stabilised hexamers themselves.
This also suggests that different cellular dNTP concentrations (such as during the cell cycle or
between different cell types) might alter HIV RT efficiency both directly, by increasing substrate con-
centration for DNA synthesis, and indirectly by stabilising the capsid. Given that ATP may stabilise
hexamers we tested whether ATP is selectively incorporated into HIV particles. ATP was detectable
in virions, although at levels approximately similar to those inside the cell (1.5 mM) suggesting no
substantial enrichment (Figure 2g).
Non-nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) inhibit
encapsidated RT but do not bind capsid pores
The fact that ATP does not inhibit ERT suggests that only a few pores are sufficient for dNTP import
or that there are alternative routes into the capsid. To investigate this further, we compared the abil-
ity of nucleotide-based reverse transcription inhibitor (NRTI) AZT and non nucleoside RT inhibitiors
Rilpivirine (RVP) and Nevirapine (NVP) to block ERT. We hypothesised that if pores represent the
only entry route into the capsid then NNRTIs might be less potent in an encapsidated assay because
they lack a triphosphate and may fail to interact with the R18 ring. We first used DSF to test

 interaction with capsid hexamers and found that only AZT and not the hydrophobic compounds RVP
or NVP matched the stabilisation of dATP (Figure 3a). A small increase in hexamer stability was
observed with RVP but equally in the presence and absence of DTT. This suggests any RVP interac-
tion is not due to the R18 hexameric ring as this feature will be destroyed upon DTT addition
because the disulphides holding the hexamer together become reduced. To corroborate these
results we measured binding by fluorescence competition with BODIPY-ATP. Only AZT could com-
pete with BODIPY-ATP and was capable of binding capsid hexamers (Figure 3b). This data is consis-
tent with pore interaction being dependent on the charged triphosphate group. Determining a
structure of capsid hexamer in complex with AZT confirmed that interaction occurs in a similar man-
ner to dATP and ATP (Table 1). AZT binds to hexamer at the centre of the six-fold axis and refine-
ment of the six symmetrically equivalent AZT molecules with equal partial occupancy provided a
good fit to the electron density (Figure 3c). As with the previous complexes, while there is clear den-
sity for the phosphates the position of the base can only be inferred. The AZT triphosphates interact
directly with R18, which adopts alternative side-chain conformers to allow multiple hydrogen bonds
and prevent steric clashes (Figure 3d). Taken together with the ATP and dATP structures, this con-
firms that there are no specific hydrophobic interactions with the pore and is consistent with a lack

 of hexamer stabilisation by hydrophobic, uncharged NNRTIs. Next, we compared the activity of
NRTI and NNRTIs in RT and ERT reactions to determine whether encapsidation markedly influences
inhibitor potency. At the IC90 for in vitro RT inhibition, both AZT and the NNRTIs RVP and NVP
blocked ERT with equivalent efficacy (Figure 3e,f). The fact that NNRTIs are equally capable of pre-
venting ERT despite showing no interaction with the charged pore suggests that specific binding is
not required for entry into the capsid. NNRTIs are sufficiently small to pass through the pore and so
may enter by simple diffusion. These experiments also do not rule out entry via a different route
entirely.
Inositol phosphate IP6 stabilises capsid hexamers and promotes DNA
accumulation during RT
Our data with ATP suggested that polyanions may have an unappreciated but important role in sta-
bilising HIV capsids and allowing encapsidated DNA synthesis to take place. Previously, we showed
that the six-fold symmetric polyaninon hexacarboxybenzene interacts avidly with the R18 charged
pore (Jacques et al., 2016). Furthermore, it bound hexamers more tightly than dNTP and stabilised
hexamers to a greater extent. Hexacarboxybenzene is not a cellular metabolite nor is it bioavailable;
however, it is reminiscent of the fully phosphorylated inositol ring of inositol hexakisphosphate (IP6),
a strongly negatively charged metabolite possessing six phosphate rather than carboxylic acid
groups (Figure 4a). Moreover, IP6 has previously been shown to interact with immature capsid and
catalyse in vitro assembly of the immature lattice (Campbell et al., 2001). We therefore tested by
DSF whether IP6 can stabilise the mature capsid and promote ERT by facilitating the accumulation of
RT products within the core. To obtain additional information as to stoichiometry of binding, we per-
formed experiments at a range of IP6 concentrations with hexamer protein present at ~33 mM. To
show the transition between stabilised species, the melt curves rather than change in stability (DTm)
are shown (Figure 4b). As predicted, IP6 strongly stabilised capsid hexamers, moreover to a substan-
tially greater degree than ATP (Figure 4c). A concentration of 20 mM IP6 gave approximately half
maximal stabilisation to a solution of 33 mM hexamer. This suggests that hexamer stabilisation by IP6
is likely stoichiometric, with one IP6 molecule per hexamer. Importantly, addition of IP6 to an ERT
reaction greatly increased the number of reverse transcripts in the presence of nuclease (Figure 4d).
This suggests that IP6 promotes the accumulation of RT products within intact capsids. To further
test this hypothesis, we repeated our ERT experiment in the presence of the anti-capsid drug PF74.
At concentrations > 10 mM, PF74 is thought to destabilise the capsid and induce premature uncoat-
ing during infection (Price et al., 2014), while in vitro it leads to a rapid failure of capsid integrity
(Marquez et al., submitted). We measured no RT products in the presence of both PF74 and nucle-
ase, consistent with induced uncoating and degradation of exposed transcripts (Figure 4d).

 Importantly, in the presence of PF74, IP6 no longer had any effect. Taken together our observations
suggest that IP6 acts to stabilise capsids but that this stabilisation is not sufficient to prevent capsid
failure induced by PF74. Nevertheless, in the absence of PF74, IP6 potently stabilised capsid cores at
much lower concentrations than ATP. At concentrations where ATP showed no measurable effect,
IP6 was able to maximally increase ERT (Figure 4e).
IP6 transforms capsid stability from ~ 7 min to >10 hr
Next, we investigated whether IP6 intrinsically stabilises the HIV capsid or just during RT. Capsid
cores are known to be unstable and uncoat after isolation. Consistent with this, addition of dNTPs
after 24 hr incubation at room temperature resulted in little measurable ERT, in contrast to dNTP
addition at time 0 which resulted in effective DNA synthesis (Figure 5a). Experiments were carried
out in the absence of nuclease, indicating that the absence of measured RT in pre-incubated samples
reflects the inefficiency of transcription outside the capsid. Importantly, however, capsid cores that
were incubated in the presence of IP6 for 24 hr before the addition of dNTPs supported a similar
level of RT as capsids that had not been subjected to temperature-induced uncoating. Together
with the previous data, this suggests that IP6 stabilises capsids both prior to and after RT. To investi-
gate this further, we sought to define the intrinsic stability of an HIV capsid and how this is impacted
by IP6. To accomplish this, we employed a newly developed single molecule assay described in
detail in an accompanying report. In summary, this method involves tethering HIV virions to glass
cover slips and permeabilizing their lipid envelope using a pore-forming toxin (Figure 5b). Chimeric
virions were used in which GFP is cleaved from Gag during maturation of the particle, resulting in
GFP molecules packaged within the mature capsid. The uncoating kinetics of individual capsids was
then determined by monitoring the loss of GFP signal (Figure 5c). Uncoating, here defined as suffi-
cient core opening to allow the escape of GFP molecules, occurs as a single rapid event at the sin-
gle-particle level (Figure 5d). In the absence of IP6, we observed that HIV capsids are highly
unstable and rapidly uncoat with a half-life of ~7 min (Figure 5d–f). Remarkably, addition of even 1
mM IP6 was sufficient to dramatically stabilise virions and increase their half-life well beyond an hour
(Figure 5e and f). Increasing the concentration of IP6 to 10 or 100 mM stabilised capsids so efficiently
that too few virions uncoated during the timescale of the experiment for an accurate measurement
of the half-life. However, estimates suggest that 10 or 100 mM IP6 stabilises capsid for 5 or 10 hr,
respectively.
IP6 coordinates the R18 ring in HIV hexamer pores
We hypothesised that the remarkable capsid stabilisation achieved by IP6 is likely because the abun-
dant negatively charged groups allow highly efficient coordination and charge neutralisation of the
six arginine side-chains in the pore. To investigate this, we solved the structure of hexamer bound to
IP6 (Table 1). The electron density for the complex confirmed that IP6 binds the R18 ring and six
symmetry copies of IP6 at partial occupancy were an excellent fit to the data (Figure 6a). This illus-
trates that IP6 can bind in a number of alternate conformations, with the axial phosphate in different
orientations. The N-terminal b-hairpin of the hexamer adopts a ‘closed’ conformation in the IP6 com-
plex, with IP6 itself located within the central chamber, above the R18 ring (Figure 6b). Weak density
was observed that may correspond to additional IP6 molecules in the solvent channel below R18 but
their inclusion did not improve the fit of the model to the data. Previous hexamer structures have
shown that the R18 side-chain can adopt multiple alternative rotamer conformations. Two alternate
R18 conformers are necessary in the IP6 complex to prevent clashes with the ligand and maintain
interaction. Despite the fact that IP6 is not planar and does not bind parallel to the R18 ring, alter-
nate R18 conformers allow each arginine within the hexamer the potential for hydrogen bond or
electrostatic interactions with a phosphate (Figure 6c,d). The structure therefore indicates that IP6 is
tightly bound by the R18 pore, would effectively neutralise the abundant positive charge and is likely
to coordinate and maintain hexamer assembly.

 capable of promoting ERT. DSF showed that other IP compounds, including IP5 and also to a lesser
extent IP4, were capable of stabilising capsid hexamers under assay conditions (Figure 7a). Addition
in ERT experiments at 1 mM concentration revealed a clearer distinction between IP compounds,
with IP4 unable to stabilise capsids and promote RT product accumulation in the presence of nucle-
ase (Figure 7b). In contrast, IP5 promoted encapsidated RT indistinguishably from IP6. Based on the
above data, we hypothesised that IP5 or IP6 could be used by HIV in order to stabilise its capsid. IP5

 in a producer cell, or following entry into a target cell. To distinguish between these two possibili-
ties, we attempted to determine whether inositol phosphates are incorporated into HIV virions. We
produced viruses from 3H-inositol labelled cells and carefully purified budded viral particles by filter-
ing and multiple centrifugal pelleting steps through sucrose. Virions were acid extracted and strong
anion exchange chromatography (Sax-HPLC) was employed to resolve the inositol phosphate pres-
ent in the virions and in the correspondent infected cell extracts. Scintillation counting of Sax-HPLC
eluted fractions revealed the specific presence of IP6 in HIV virions (Figure 7c). Importantly, the lev-
els of IP6 were enriched over those of IP5; indeed little IP5 was detected despite the fact that it is
present within cells at concentrations around 25% that of IP6. This suggests that it is IP6 selectively
incorporated into virions rather than from potential co-purifying microvesicles that is being
measured (Bess et al., 1997). Subtilisin treatment is used to reduce microvesicle contamination in
HIV-1 virion preparations (Ott, 2009). To ensure that IP6 detection is not from contaminating micro-
vesicles, we repeated our experiments on subtilisin-treated samples. Subtilisin removed protein con-
taminants and abolished HIV-1 infectivity consistent with the digestion of envelope proteins, but did
not reduce the levels of capsid protein or incorporated IP6 (Figure 7d and Figure 7—figure supple-
ment 1). Finally, to directly demonstrate that IP6 is associated with the capsid core rather than the
viral membrane, we stripped the envelope from produced virions using the same triton-layer centri-
fugation method as employed to prepare cores for ERT (Shah and Aiken, 2011). Incorporation in
capsid cores was compared to virions by calculating the scintillation counts for IP6 per mg p24, as
determined by ELISA. To confirm that our core prep has removed enveloped particles, we also

 compared the relative levels of inositol. Inositol is an osmolyte found in the cytosol at ~mM concen-
trations and is therefore only expected in samples derived from enveloped virions and microvesicles.
Consistent with this, we observed loss of the inositol peak in the capsid only sample (Figure 7e).
However, we observed the same levels of IP6 in both samples demonstrating that IP6 is associated
with the capsid core (Figure 7f). This result reinforces that measured IP6 is not derived from microve-
sicles but is enriched into HIV-1 virions and bound to the capsid core. We calculated the number of
IP6 molecules per virion by determining the fraction of cellular IP6 that is incorporated. Parallel analy-
sis of the cell extracts by PAGE-based separation revealed that 0.8% of total IP6 radioactivity was
incorporated into the produced virions (Figure 7g) (Losito et al., 2009; Wilson et al., 2015). This
corresponds to approximately 309 ± 41 IP6 molecules per viral particle, which is sufficient for 1:1
stoichiometry with hexamer pores present in an intact virion.
Discussion
Here, we have shown that HIV virions package IP6 when they bud from a producer cell, that IP6 coor-
dinates the electrostatic pores in HIV hexamers and that IP6 dramatically increases capsid stability
both intrinsically and during ERT. The logic for requiring a compound such as IP6 to stabilise the

 capsid is in part due to the presence of an otherwise repulsive charged structural feature (R18 in the
mature capsid). However, if nullifying charge were the only reason for IP6 requirement, then it would
be simpler to evolve these residues into apolar alternatives. Thus, using IP6 as a stabilising agent
must confer benefits onto the HIV capsid that cannot be achieved by encoding stability via capsid
residues alone. A central coordinating ligand like IP6 allows proteins to be stabilised independently
of a hydrophobic core or surface and has been used extensively in evolution, giving rise to motifs
like the zinc-finger. Small molecule ligands are also highly effective at catalysing multimerisation,
something of particular advantage to an assembling viral capsid. Examples where IP6 has been
exploited as a small molecule chaperone include HDAC co-repressor complexes, where it promotes
stability (Watson et al., 2016), and Bruton’s tyrosine kinase, where it induces transient dimerisation
of the PH-TH module (Wang et al., 2015). A further attractive feature of using a small molecule
ligand like IP6 to drive self-assembly is that it provides an inbuilt mechanism of disassembly: ligand
binding is reversible and so its dissociation can be used as a disassembly trigger.
Using IP6 to stabilise the capsid therefore avoids a fundamental problem in capsid design, namely
that the capsid must be strong enough to protect its cargo but not too strong that it can never be
uncoated. Based on our data, we propose that IP6 is the HIV equivalent of a picornavirus pocket fac-
tor, providing both stability and a mechanism to initiate uncoating. Pocket factors were originally
described by Michael Rossmann, who observed a small molecule bound to the picornavirus capsid
that he proposed stabilised it (Hogle et al., 1985; Rossmann et al., 1985). Pocket factors have sub-
sequently been shown to stabilise picornavirus capsids until conformational changes induced by
environmental cues during infection promote their dissociation and induce disassembly. We
hypothesise that IP6 stabilises the HIV capsid in the cytosol, until its release triggers uncoating.
Known capsid cofactors could provide the cues to induce a conformational change and provoke dis-
sociation of IP6. The dynamic N-terminal b-hairpin present in hexamers (Jacques et al., 2016) pro-
vides one possible mechanism; when closed IP6 will be retained in the pore but when open it would
be free to dissociate. Testing this mechanism will be a key goal of future study, as will determining
the importance of IP6 in post-entry HIV-1 infection.
While we propose that IP6 serves as an HIV pocket factor, we cannot rule out that other cellular
polyanions also play a role. For instance, although we observed no evidence for enrichment, ATP is
highly abundant and was readily detected in virions. In our original discovery of the R18 pore and its
importance in HIV RT and infection we postulated that it provided a channel to import nucleotides
to drive ERT. The cellular data presented in that work is also consistent with the R18 pore being
required to bind IP6 in order to stabilise the capsid during its transit through the cytosol. Further
experiments are needed to dissect the relative importance of the R18 pore in attracting nucleotides
for RT versus binding IP6 for capsid stabilisation. The fact that high concentrations of either ATP or
IP6, which would be competitors with dNTPs for pore binding, increase rather than decrease ERT
efficiency argues against the R18 pore being essential for nucleotide import. However, as there is a
multi-log increase in accumulated viral DNA as a result of capsid stabilisation by polyanions this
could mask any decline due to reduced nucleotide import. Capsid permeability is not well under-
stood, but the experiments presented here comparing inhibition by NRTIs and NNRTIs in ERT versus
cellular infection suggest that either their efficiency of entry into the capsid is similar – and that inter-
action with the R18 ring is therefore not essential - or that this is not a limiting step. Either way, this
indicates that small molecules not bound by the R18 ring can still enter the capsid through the pore,
or through solvent channels as has previously been proposed.
Importantly, as mature hexamers form only after budding, they cannot be responsible for recruit-
ing polyanions such as IP6 into the virion. Of note, IP6 has previously been shown to catalyse imma-
ture lattice assembly (Campbell et al., 2001), suggesting it has a role in the formation and
maturation of capsid during viral production. In the immature hexamer, there are two lysine rings
(K227 and K158; equivalent to Gag residues 359 and 290) that are analogous to the R18 ring we
have described in the mature hexamer (Wagner et al., 2016). We speculate that it is these lysine
rings that are responsible for the specific recruitment of IP6 into virions, where it drives immature lat-
tice assembly. Upon protease cleavage and maturation, the six-helix bundle and lysine rings will be
lost, making IP6 available to bind the R18 pore in mature hexamers and promote mature lattice for-
mation. Thus, we propose that HIV capitalises on a readily available cellular polyanion to catalyse the
assembly of immature and mature lattices, promote their stability and regulate the uncoating of cap-
sid in newly infected cells. The identification of the inositol phosphate IP6 in HIV virions and its role

 in imparting onto the capsid a property of metastability provides a new dependence to be exploited
in antiviral development.
Materials and methods
Protein production and purification
The CA N-terminal domain and the disulfide-stabilised CA hexamer were expressed and purified as
previously described, briefly: p24 capsid protein was disassembled in Tris (pH 8.0, 50 mM), NaCl (40
mM), 2-mercaptoethanol (20 mM), then reassembled in Tris (pH 8.0, 50 mM), NaCl (1 M), 2-mercap-
toethanol (20 mM). This was followed by oxidation in Tris (pH 8.0, 50 mM), NaCl (1 M) and redisper-
sion in Tris (pH 8.0, 20 mM), NaCl (40 mM). Reassembled hexamers were observed by non-reducing
SDS–PAGE.
Differential scanning fluorimetry
DSF measurements were performed using a Prometheus NT.48 (NanoTemper Technologies) over a
temperature range of 20–95˚C using a ramp rate of 2.0˚C / min. CA hexamer samples were prepared
at a final concentration of 200 mM monomer in Intracellular Buffer in the presence or absence of 4
mM DTT. dNTPs or competitors were added at 200 mM. DSF scans are single reads of three repli-
cates and were performed at least three times unless otherwise stated. Consistency between like
points yields an uncertainty in Tm of no greater than 0.2˚C.
Plasmids
Lentiviral packaging plasmid psPAX2 encoding the Gag, Pol, Rev, and Tat genes and pMDG2, which
encodes VSV-G envelope, was obtained from Didier Trono (Addgene plasmids # 12260 and #
12259). HIV-1 Gag-Pol expression plasmid pCRV-1 (Zennou et al., 2004) and HIV-GFP encoding
plasmid CSGW (Naldini et al., 1996) were kind gifts from Stuart Neil. The proviral construct pNL4.3-
iGFP-DEnv was generated as described previously (Aggarwal et al., 2012). It contains the open-
reading frame for eGFP flanked by protease cleavage sites inserted into the Gag gene between the
coding sequences for MA and CA. In addition the start codon of the Env gene is mutated to a stop
codon to prevent expression of the envelope protein.
Preparation of HIV-1 virions
Replication deficient VSV-G pseudotyped HIV-1 virions were produced in HEK293T cells using
pMDG2, pCRV GagPol and CSGW as described previously (Price et al., 2014). Viral supernatant
from HEK293T cells was pelleted over a 20% sucrose cushion in a SW28 rotor (Beckman) at 28,000
rpm at 4˚C. Pellets were resuspended in PBS. For removal of microvesicle contaminants, samples
were treated with subtilisin essentially as described by Ott (2009), with virions subsequently purified
by ultracentrifugation through 20% sucrose. Subtilisin efficiency was determined by SDS PAGE and
infection assay.
Preparation of HIV-1 cores
HIV-1 capsid cores were prepared using a protocol based on Shah and Aiken (2011). 90 ml
HEK293T supernatant containing VSV-G pseudotyped HIV-1 GFP was pelleted over 20% sucrose dis-
solved in core prep buffer (CPB; 20 mM Tris (pH 7.4), 20 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2) in an SW28 rotor
(Beckman) at 25,000 rpm at 4˚C. Pellets were gently resuspended at 4˚C in CPB for 1 hr with occa-
sional agitation. Resuspended pellets were treated with DNase I from bovine pancreas (Sigma
Aldrich) for 1 hr at 200 mg/ml at room temperature to remove contaminating extra-viral DNA. Virus
was subjected to spin-through detergent stripping of the viral membrane as follows. A gradient at
80–30% sucrose was prepared in SW40Ti ultracentrifuge tubes and overlaid with 250 ml 1% Triton
X-100 in 15% sucrose, followed by 250 ml 7.5% sucrose. All solutions were prepared in CPB. 750 ml
DNase-treated, concentrated virus was layered on top of the gradient and subjected to 32,500 rpm
at 4˚C for 16 hr. The preparation was fractionated and the location of cores was determined by
ELISA for p24 (Perkin Elmer). Core-containing fractions were pooled and snap frozen before storage
at �80˚C.

 Preparation of cores for EM imaging
Cores were prepared as above. Pooled core fractions were diluted to reduce the sucrose concentra-
tion to 20%, then samples were spun 2 hr at 4˚C at 45 K rpm in TLA55 rotor. Cores were resus-
pended in 8 ml CPB with 20% sucrose and loaded onto glow discharged carbon grids (Cu, 400 mesh,
Electron Microscopy Services) for 5 min then stained for 3 min with 2% uranyl acetate. Micrographs
were taken at room temperature on a Tecnai Spirit (FEI) operated at an accelerated voltage of 120
keV and Gatan 2k � 2 k CCD camera. Images were collected with a total dose of 30 e-/A ˚
2, between
a defocus of 1–3 mm and a magnified pixel size of 0.93 nm/pixel.
Encapsidated reverse transcription assays
Viral cores were diluted to 50 ng/ml p24 with 60% sucrose in CPB. Final concentrations of dNTPs
were 1 mM each (unless otherwise indicated), DNase I and RNase A were at 100 mg/ml. 20 ml reac-
tions were incubated at room temperature for 16 hr unless indicated otherwise. 4 ml of 5xMicrolysis
Plus (Microzone) was added to each sample and processed according to manufacturers instructions.
Reverse transcript products were detected using TaqMan Fast Universal PCR Mix (ABI) and RU5 pri-
mers to detect strong-stop DNA40 (RU5 forward: 5’-TCTGGCTAACTAGGGAACCCA-3’; RU5

Crystallisation, structure solution and analysis
All crystals were grown at 17˚C by sitting-drop vapour diffusion in which 100 nl protein was mixed
with 100 nl precipitant and suspended above 80 ml precipitant. The structures were all obtained
from 10 to 12 mg/ml protein mixed with PEG550MME (13–14%), KSCN (0.15 M), Tris (0.1 M, pH 8.5)
and cryoprotected with precipitant supplemented with 20% MPD. For the ATP-bound structure, the
protein was supplemented with 1 mM ATP or IP6 immediately before crystallisation. All crystals were
flash-cooled in liquid nitrogen and data collected either in-house using Cu Ka X-rays produced by a
Rigaku FR-E rotating anode generator with diffractionrecorded on a mar345 image plate detector
(marXperts), or at beamline I02 at Diamond Light Source. The data sets were processed using the
CCP4 Program suite (Winn, 2003). Data were indexed and integrated with iMOSFLM and scaled
and merged with AIMLESS (Evans and Murshudov, 2013). Structures were solved by molecular
replacement using PHASER (McCoy, 2007) and refined using REFMAC5 (Murshudov et al., 1997).
Between rounds of refinement, the model was manually checked and corrected against the corre-
sponding electron-density maps in COOT (Emsley and Cowtan, 2004). Solvent molecules and
bound ligands were added as the refinement progressed either manually or automatically within
COOT, and were routinely checked for correct stereochemistry, for sufficient supporting density
above a 2Fo � Fc threshold of 1.0 s and for a reasonable thermal factor. The quality of the model
was regularly checked for steric clashes, incorrect stereochemistry and rotamer outliers using
MOLPROBITY (Chen et al., 2015). Final figures were rendered in The PyMOL Molecular Graphics
System, Version 1.5.0.4 Schro
¨ dinger, LLC. Structures and data were deposited in the PDB database
with codes 6ERM (ATP complex), 6ERN (AZT complex) and 6ES8 (IP6 complex).
Single molecule measurements
Viral particles were produced by transfecting HEK293T cells with a mixture of pNL4.3-iGFP-DEnv
and psPAX2 (1.4:1, mol/mol), collected 48 hr post transfection and viral membrane proteins were
biotinylated using EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-LC-LC-Biotin (Thermo Scientific). Biotinylated viral particles
were purified by size exclusion chromatography using a HiPrep 16/60 Sephacryl S-500 HR column
(GE Healthcare) and captured on the surface of a glass coverslip modified with PLL(20)-g[3.4]-PEG
(2)/PEG(3.4)-biotin (Susos AG) and streptavidin. The viral envelope was permeabilised by addition of
perfringolysin O (200 nM) in imaging buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 7.0, 100 mM NaCl) via microfluidic
delivery and the diffraction-limited signal from the GFP-loaded viral particles was monitored by
time-lapse total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy. Images were analysed with software

 written in MATLAB (The MathWorks, Inc.). Fluorescence intensity traces were calculated for each
viral particle in the field of view by integrating the fluorescence intensity in a 7 � 7 pixel region.
Membrane permeabilisation was detected as a rapid drop in the signal resulting from the release of
GFP contained in the viral particle in the volume outside the capsid (not shown). This step mimics
viral fusion in that the capsid is exposed to the surrounding medium and was defined as time zero
for measuring capsid opening. Particles with intact cores were identified as those with residual GFP
signal after permeabilisation, arising from GFP molecules trapped inside the closed capsid. The
onset of capsid uncoating was then detected as the sudden release (loss of the residual signal occur-
ring typically within one frame) of the encapsidated GFP molecules via a sufficiently large defect in
the capsid lattice.
Production of 3H-inositol labelled virus
One � 106 293 T cells were seeded into 2 � 10 cm dishes in inositol-free DMEM and left to adhere
overnight. The media was replaced with 5 ml inositol-free DMEM supplemented with 5 mCi/ml 3H-
inositol (Perkin Elmer). After 3 days incubation, an additional 5 ml inositol-free media containing 5
mCi/ml 3H-inositol was added onto cells, which were then transfected with pMDG2, pCRV GagPol
and CSGW. Cells were left for a further 3 days to produce VSV-G pseudotyped HIV1. Viral superna-
tants were topped up to 30 ml and pelleted over a 5 ml 20% sucrose cushion) in a SW28 rotor (Beck-
man) at 28,000 rpm at 4˚C. Pellets were resuspended in inositol-free media and pelleted as
previously. After the second spin, pellets were resuspended in 1 ml PBS and spun at 13,000 rpm at
4˚C in a bench top microfuge for 60 min. Pellets were frozen at �20˚C until processing. Cells were
washed with PBS, then harvested by scraping, counted and pelleted for quantification of cellular IP6
labelling. Pellets were frozen at �20˚C until processing. For comparison of virion and purified capsid
core samples, p24 levels were determined by ELISA for p24 (Perkin Elmer).
Cells
293T CRL-3216 cells were purchased from ATCC and authenticated by the supplier. All cells are reg-
ularly tested and are mycoplasma free.
Purification and HPLC analysis of inositol phosphates
Inositol phosphates extraction and analysis was performed modifying a previously described
protocol (Azevedo and Saiardi, 2006). Cells and viral pellets were resuspended in 200 ml of extrac-
tion buffer (1M Perchloric acid, 5 mM EDTA) and incubated on ice for 10 min. The samples were
spun out at 13,000 rpm at 4˚C for 5 min and the supernatant recovered. Viral pellet were re-
extracted for 10 min at 100˚C using another 200 ml of extraction buffer and spun out as before.
Supernatants from acid extractions were neutralised to pH6-8 using 1M Potassium carbonate, 5 mM
EDTA (approximately 100 ml) and incubated on ice with the lids open for 1–2 hr. Samples were spun
at 13,000 rpm at 4˚C for 5 min and supernatant containing inositol phosphates was loaded onto
HPLC or stored at 4˚C. Inositol phosphates were resolved by strong anion exchange chromatogra-
phy Sax-HPLC on a Partisphere SAX 4.6 � 125 mm column (Hichrom). The column was eluted with a
gradient generated by mixing buffer A (1 mM EDTA) and buffer B (1 mM EDTA; 1.3 M (NH4)2HPO4,
pH 4.0) as follows: 0–5 min, 0% B; 5–10 min, 0–30% B; 10–85 min, 30–100% B; 85–95 min, 100% B.
Fractions (1 ml) were collected and analysed by scintillation counting after adding 4 ml of Ultima-Flo
AP LCS-cocktail (Perkin Elmer).
Calculation of ATP and IP6 per virion
The presence of ATP in virions was determined using a luciferase-based detection system following
manufacturers instructions (Abcam ab113849). A sensitivity of 1 nM ATP detection was confirmed
using a titration of 293 T cell lysate. The concentration of ATP estimated in 293 T cells assuming a
volume of 1.77 � 10�12 L was ~8 mM. The concentration of ATP estimated in HIV virions, assuming a
volume of 5.2 � 10�19 L, was ~1.5 mM. The level of IP6 in 293 T cells was determined by PAGE anal-
ysis of TiO2 purified inositol phosphates alongside polyphosphate standards (Sigma Aldrich S6128)
and known standards of IP6 (Wilson et al., 2015). For 4 � 106 cells there is estimated to be approxi-
mately 0.75 nmol IP6. The calculated figure of 309 ± 41 IP6 per virion is an average of three indepen-
dent biological replicates.
