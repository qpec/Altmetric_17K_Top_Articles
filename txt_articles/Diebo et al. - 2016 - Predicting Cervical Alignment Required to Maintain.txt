Abstract
Study Design—Retrospective cohort
Objective—To investigate the cervical alignment necessary for the maintenance of horizontal 
gaze depends on underlying thoracolumbar alignment
Summary of Background Data—Cervical curvature (CC) is affected by thoracic and global 
alignment. Recent studies suggest large variability in normative CC ranging from lordotic to 
kyphotic alignment. No previous studies have assessed the effect of global spinal alignment on CC 
in maintenance of horizontal gaze.
Methods—Patients without previous history of spinal surgery and were able to maintain their 
horizontal gaze while undergoing full body imaging were included. Patients were stratified based 
on thoracic kyphosis (TK) into (<30, 30–40, 40–50 and >50) then by SRS-Schwab sagittal vertical 
axis (SVA) modifier into (posterior alignment SVA<0, aligned 0–50 and malaligned >50mm). 
Cervical alignment was assessed among SVA grade in TK groups. Stepwise linear regression 
analysis was applied on random selection of 60% of the population. A simplified formula was 
developed and validated on the remaining 40%.
Results—In each TK group (n=118, 137, 125, 197), lower cervical curvature (C2-C7) was 
significantly more lordotic by increased Schwab SVA grade. T1 slope and cervical SVA 
significantly increased with increased thoracolumbar (C7-S1) SVA. Upper cervical curvature (C0-
C2) and mismatch between T1 slope and cervical curvature (T1-CL) were similar. Regression 
analysis revealed LL minus TK (LL-TK) as an independent predictor (r=0.640, r2=0.410) with 
formula: CC = 10 - (LL-TK)/2. Validation revealed that the absolute difference between the

 predicted CC and the actual CC was 8.5°. Moreover, 64.2% of patients had their predicted C2-C7 
values were within 10° of the actual CC.
Conclusions—Cervical kyphosis may represent normal alignment in a significant number of 
patients. However, in patients with SVA > 50 and greater thoracic curvatures, cervical lordosis is 
needed to maintain the gaze. Cervical alignment can be predicted from underlying TK and lumbar 
lordosis, which may be clinically relevant when considering correction for thoracolumbar or 
cervical deformity

Introduction
For millennia, the human body has evolved in respect to two major goals: the maintenance 
of both bipedal standing position and horizontal gaze. Exclusive bipedal standing posture 
freed the upper limbs, allowed humans greater interaction with the environment. However, 
this adjustment was complicated by the need to support the cranium while maintaining a 
functional gaze.1–4 The relationship between alignment and the gaze necessitates a thorough 
understanding of the Cranio-spino-pelvic alignment as one component of Balance. Specific 
sagittal cranial and spino-pelvic parameters correlating to HRQOL scores have been 
described and published in numerous studies5–13.
Horizontal gaze is necessary for neurosensorial interactions with the surrounding 
environment, because it allows humans to avoid obstacles14 and helps regulate dynamic 
stability15–17. However, the cranium is intricately linked to its foundation, the cervical spine. 
In turn, the cervical spine must remain in harmony with the adjacent thoracic curvature and 
is significantly affected by the correction of thoracolumbar deformities in sagittally 
malaligned patients21,24,25.
Multiple aspects of the cervical spine have been well-described in the literature. Hardacker 
et al reported a normal range of cervical lordosis of 40° +/− 9.7°, with the majority of the 
lordosis occurring at the C1-C2 level26. Other authors have demonstrated that kyphotic 
alignment may occur in up to thirty percent of the normal population27,28. However, the 
cervical spine receives several inputs that influence its posture, and isolated investigations of 
this curvature may not adequately address its proper alignment.
Therefore, the purpose of the current study was to investigate the effect of thoracic and 
global alignment on the upper and lower cervical sagittal curves in their mission of 
maintaining a horizontal gaze.
Methods

 Statistical Analysis
The study population was described using descriptive analysis. Patients were stratified based 
on thoracic kyphosis (TK) (<30°, 30°−40°, 40°–50°, and >50°), then based on Scoliosis 
Research Society-Schwab SVA grade (posterior alignment SVA<0 mm, neutral alignment 0–
50mm, and anterior positive malalignment >50mm). Cervical parameters were analyzed by 
comparison between SVA groups inside each TK group using analysis of variance 
(ANOVA). Pearson correlation was used to investigate relationships between cervical and 
thoracolumbar parameters.
Formula Development and Validation
A random selection of 60% of the study population was used to develop the formula, and the 
remaining 40% was used for formula validation. Stepwise linear regression analysis was 
performed to predict lower cervical sagittal curve based on thoracic kyphosis and lumbar 
lordosis along with global spinal alignment (SVA), controlling for patient age, gender, pelvic 
morphology. A simplified formula was derived from this analysis. For validation, the 
percentage of patients with predicted CC within 10° of their actual CC was investigated. ISO 
(International Organization of Standardization) reproducibility of lower CC used in this 
software was 5.87°31. Level of significance was set at p < 0.05.
Results
There were 577 patient visits included, with the patients’ mean age 54.8 ± 19.5 years; mean 
BMI 27.0 ± 6.1 kg/m2 (mean weight: 74.3kg, mean height: 1.66 m), and 65.7% females. 
Diagnoses included were: 99 degenerative disc disease, 58 degenerative spondylolisthesis, 
and 420 adult spinal deformity patients. Overall, 168 visits out of 577 (29.1%) maintained a 
horizontal gaze with kyphotic cervical alignment. These patients were significantly younger 
(42.2 vs. 59.9 years old, p=0.001) than patients with lordotic cervical alignment, and had 
less BMI (25.7 vs. 27.4, p=0.016), and a similar proportion of females 66.7% vs. 65.3%.
Group Analysis
The number of visits in each SVA group was as follows: (SVA < 0 mm: 211, SVA 0–50 mm: 
249, SVA > 50 mm: 117). The number of visits in each TK groups was as follows: (TK <30° 
– 118), (TK 30–40° – 137), (TK 40°–50° – 125), and (TK > 50° – 197). The distribution of 
SVA visits in each TK groups was not significantly different (p=0.155).
Cervical alignment analysis
Within each TK group, the lower cervical sagittal curve became significantly more lordotic 
with increasing SVA (Figure 2). All patients with SVA > 50 mm or TK > 40° had lordotic 
CC. Patients who were posteriorly aligned (SVA < 0 mm) had kyphotic alignment when TK 
< 40° but neutral alignment when TK was 40–50°. Patients with TK > 50° had lordotic CC, 
regardless of SVA. All p < 0.05.
cSVA significantly increased with increased SVA groups (Table 1). Upper cervical sagittal 
curve (C0-C2) and C1 axis were similar between all SVA groups. C0-C2 ranged between 
−28.8°– −31.4° (p > 0.6 in all TK groups), whereas C1 axis ranged between 10.0° – 14.1° (p

 > 0.18 in all TK groups). TS-CL was also similar between SVA groups and ranged between 
17.5°- 22.2° (p > 0.24 in all TK groups). However, T1 slope significantly increased with 
increase SVA in each TK group (Table 2). Correlation analysis revealed that upper cervical 
sagittal curve (C0-C2) correlated with cSVA (r=−0.270, p=0.001), but did not correlate with 
SVA (r=−0.054, p=0.196). However, Lower CC (C2-C7) was correlated with SVA (r=
−0.431, p=0.001) and cSVA (r=−0.248, p=0.001).
Age analysis—Older age independently correlated with increased values of both TK and 
SVA (P<0.05). Of the cases with kyphotic cervical alignment, patients with TK < 30° and 
negative SVA (<0mm) were younger (mean age 38.2 years) than patients with TK 30–40° 
and SVA <0mm (mean age 43.7 years). Following this trend, the patients with kyphotic 
cervical alignment, TK<30°, and SVA 0–50mm had mean age 52.1 years. (Table 3)
Formula development
345 (57.88%) visits were included. Regression analysis demonstrated that LL minus TK 
(LL-TK: both with absolute value) was an independent predictor of CC (R=0.640, 
R2=0.410, p<0.05) (Figure 3). Addition of SS to the model improved the CC prediction 
capability to R= 0.799. The simplified version of LL-TK model was denoted by the 
following: CC = 10 - (LL-TK)/2.
Formula validation
For validation of this formula, 232 visits were included. The absolute difference between the 
predicted CC and the actual CC was 8.5°. 64.2% of predicted CC values were within 10° of 
the actual CC values.
Discussion
Cervical kyphosis is a prevalent phenomenon and is often interpreted to indicate cervical 
deformity. However, studies have shown that in up to 30% of patients, cervical kyphosis may 
simply be a component of normal sagittal spinal alignment.27,28,32 Thus, it is clear that in 
some patients, the presence of a kyphotic cervical alignment may indicate substantial 
deformity and be linked to poor clinical outcomes, while in others, a kyphotic cervical 
alignment may be appropriate given the patient’s global and thoracic sagittal alignment. 
There is therefore an obvious need to more accurately define cervical deformity and 
distinguish it from cervical compensation for thoracolumbar alignment. This study sought to 
investigate the relationship between cervical alignment, thoracic kyphosis, and the global 
sagittal alignment.
In the present study, of all patients who presented to the spine surgeon’s office without 
cervical complaints, 29% were able to maintain horizontal gaze with kyphotic cervical 
alignment, which is consistent with rates in previous literature27,28,32. These patients were 
younger with lower BMI, though they were otherwise similar in gender.
The current results demonstrate that in patients with normal horizontal gaze, thoracolumbar 
alignment and thoracic kyphosis independently impacted cervical alignment. As thoracic 
kyphosis increased, the amount of lower cervical lordosis increased. Similarly, as the global

 alignment (assessed by SVA) progressed (greater than 0mm), cervical lordosis increased as 
well. Conversely, posterior global alignment and flattening of the thoracic spine led to 
progressive cervical kyphosis. These findings were echoed by Yu et al, who studied both 
symptomatic and asymptomatic patients and found that larger curvatures in the thoracic and 
lumbar spines were associated with greater cervical lordosis.33
Based on these findings, kyphotic alignment of the cervical spine cannot alone define 
cervical deformity. Correspondingly, cervical lordosis should not be synonymous with 
harmonious alignment. In patients with severe thoracic kyphosis or large global 
malalignment, increased cervical lordosis may actually be functioning as a compensatory 
mechanism to maintain horizontal gaze.34 In general, this data showed that patients were 
able to maintain the horizontal gaze with mean C2-C7 values that ranged from 8.7 of 
kyphosis to −29.5 degrees of lordosis.
Though it appeared that global alignment of the spine was closely linked to the lower 
cervical sagittal curve (CC), the upper lordosis (C0-C2) consistently remained around −30°. 
Though this value is somewhat higher than the means of 14–16° reported by Le Huec et al27 
and Park et al,35 both other studies and the present study found consistent values of the C0-
C2 in patients without cervical complaints, despite variations in other thoracolumbar 
parameters. Importantly, however, these studies only established the consistency of the C0-
C2 angle in asymptomatic individuals, and presumably, those able to maintain horizontal 
gaze. If the C2-C7 region is capable of providing the adequate regional cervical alignment 
necessary for maintenance of the horizontal gaze, the C0-C2 angle will remain constant 
across ages and thoracolumbar alignment parameters. Yet in patients with true cervical 
deformity, such as those with severely malaligned cSVA, the C0-C2 region may be recruited 
as an additional compensatory mechanism to maintain horizontal gaze. This hypothesis was 
supported by Protopsaltis et al23, who found that the C0-C2 varied in patients with 
thoracolumbar deformity and concomitant cervical malalignment. Therefore, this value of 
approximately 30° for the C0-C2 may serve as potential threshold for classifying cervical 
deformity. If larger than 30°, this angle may represent increased compensation from the 
upper cervical region for a regional lower cervical deformity.
In addition, this study investigated the cervical SVA (cSVA) across the patient groups. 
Among all of the alignment subgroups, the highest cSVA was observed in the group with 
SVA > 50mm and TK > 50°. This value of 41mm for cSVA thus represented the maximum 
amount of cSVA tolerated by patients while still remaining asymptomatic and able to 
maintain horizontal gaze. Importantly, this value is nearly identical to the threshold of 
cSVA=40mm that corresponds to poor health-related quality of life scores as described by 
Tang et al.36
From these findings, a different understanding of cervical deformity arises: the inability (or, 
the painful/symptomatic ability) to maintain horizontal gaze. Recent work from Blondel et 
al25 and Barrey et al37 suggested that because patients with lordotic CC have significantly 
greater values for SRS-Schwab sagittal parameters (SVA, PT, and PI-LL), increasing 
cervical lordosis is required as a compensatory mechanism to maintain horizontal gaze. In 
this study, patients with SVA > 50 mm were more likely to adapt lordotic cervical alignment,

 regardless of their thoracic kyphosis. These patients were also significantly older than 
patients with less drastic values for thoracic kyphosis and global alignment. Related work 
from Schwab et al proposed age-adjusted alignment targets based on health-related quality 
of life scores; for example, for patients > 65 years old, SVA between 50–65 mm is actually 
ideal.38 For these older patients or other individuals with an element of positive global 
malalignment (SVA > 50 mm), a kyphotic cervical alignment is less likely to be adequate to 
keep an horizontal gaze. Thus, a thorough evaluation of thoracolumbar alignment is 
necessary for the evaluation of potential cervical realignment patients.
Finally, the present study proposed a preliminary formula to predict the cervical alignment 
necessary for horizontal gaze. The mismatch between lumbar lordosis and thoracic kyphosis 
(LL-TK) was an independent predictor of C2-C7 sagittal curve. The following simplified 
formula was developed using this parameter: CC = 10 - (LL-TK)/2. Understood in a clinical 
context, several scenarios may lead to the need for increased cervical lordosis following the 
reverse pendulum concept of Dubousset39. The first possibility is isolated thoracic 
hyperkyphosis, which would warrant increased cervical lordosis. However, increased 
cervical lordosis would also be needed for a patient with pathologic loss of lordosis, and 
lack of compensatory thoracic hypokyphosis. Future work investigating additional clinical 
applications for this formula will undoubtedly be valuable.
This study also investigated the role of the T1 slope across the different TK and SVA 
subgroups. T1 slope significantly increased with increases in both thoracic kyphosis and 
global alignment, with a minimum of 11.6 in when TK was <30° and SVA was <0mm, and a 
maximum of 51.7° when TK was >50° and SVA was >50mm. These targets for each specific 
thoracic kyphosis and global alignment may be useful in surgical planning for patients 
undergoing correction of major sagittal deformity. By taking these ideal T1 slope values into 
account, surgeons may respect the ideal cervical alignment necessary to maintain horizontal 
gaze while still performing the adequate thoracolumbar reconstruction. For example: Fifty 
five year old patient is undergoing cervical realignment surgery with SVA of 40 mm, TK of 
35° and LL of 50°. Based on patients of this study (Table 3), the cervical alignment 
necessary to maintain the horizontal gaze was slightly lordotic and measured about 4.5°. CC 
can also be calculated using the formula: CC = 10 – (50–35)/2 = 2.5°. On the other hand, if 
this patient is undergoing thoracolumbar fusion to the upper thoracic region, T1 slope is 
recommended to be about 23.5° (Table 2).
Several limitations in this study are recognized. The first is the heterogeneity of the cohort; 
the patients used in this study represented a wide variety of visits to the spine surgeon’s 
office for any matters not pertaining to the cervical spine. In addition, the alignment ideals 
set forth in this study are closely linked to maintenance of horizontal gaze, though future 
studies should consider additional variables in the role of the cervical spine, including head 
positioning, chest and face morphologies, and soft tissue/muscular involvement. This study 
addressed a small part of the entire understanding of postural alignment and horizontal gaze. 
It remains important for an ambulating person to have enough flexion in the Cranio-thoracic 
area to allow vision of his or her feet to avoid stumbling while ambulating. If this is not 
present, leaning on a walker or two canes is necessary for safety. Of course, additional 
validation with health-related quality of life outcomes would be critical.

 Conclusion
Despite the traditional thought that cervical kyphosis is indicative of cervical deformity, it 
may actually represent normal alignment in a significant number of well-aligned or 
posteriorly aligned patients. However, in patients with SVA > 50mm and greater thoracic 
kyphosis, cervical lordosis is needed to maintain the gaze. Cervical alignment can be 
predicted from underlying TK and lumbar lordosis, or suggested values of T1 slope, which 
may be clinically relevant when considering correction for thoracolumbar or cervical 
deformity.
