AbstrAct
Objective
To use mendelian randomisation to investigate 
whether 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration has a 
causal effect on gestational hypertension or pre-
eclampsia.
Design
One and two sample mendelian randomisation 
analyses.
setting
Two European pregnancy cohorts (Avon Longitudinal 
Study of Parents and Children, and Generation R 
Study), and two case-control studies (subgroup 
nested within the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort 
Study, and the UK Genetics of Pre-eclampsia Study).
ParticiPants
7389 women in a one sample mendelian 
randomisation analysis (751 with gestational 
hypertension and 135 with pre-eclampsia), and 3388 
pre-eclampsia cases and 6059 controls in a two 
sample mendelian randomisation analysis.
exPOsures
Single nucleotide polymorphisms in genes 
associated with vitamin D synthesis (rs10741657 
and rs12785878) and metabolism (rs6013897 and 
rs2282679) were used as instrumental variables.
Main OutcOMe Measures
Gestational hypertension and pre-eclampsia defined 
according to the International Society for the Study of 
Hypertension in Pregnancy.
results
In the conventional multivariable analysis, the 
relative risk for pre-eclampsia was 1.03 (95% 
confidence interval 1.00 to 1.07) per 10% decrease 
in 25-hydroxyvitamin D level, and 2.04 (1.02 to 
4.07) for 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels <25 nmol/L 
compared with ≥75 nmol/L. No association was 
found for gestational hypertension. The one sample 
mendelian randomisation analysis using the total 
genetic risk score as an instrument did not provide 
strong evidence of a linear effect of 25-hydroxyvitamin 
D on the risk of gestational hypertension or pre-
eclampsia: odds ratio 0.90 (95% confidence interval 
0.78 to 1.03) and 1.19 (0.92 to 1.52) per 10% 
decrease, respectively. The two sample mendelian 
randomisation estimate gave an odds ratio for pre-
eclampsia of 0.98 (0.89 to 1.07) per 10% decrease 
in 25-hydroxyvitamin D level, an odds ratio of 0.96 
(0.80 to 1.15) per unit increase in the log(odds) of 
25-hydroxyvitamin D level <75 nmol/L, and an odds 
ratio of 0.93 (0.73 to 1.19) per unit increase in the 
log(odds) of 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels <50 nmol/L.
cOnclusiOns
No strong evidence was found to support a causal 
effect of vitamin D status on gestational hypertension 
or pre-eclampsia. Future mendelian randomisation 
studies with a larger number of women with pre-
eclampsia or more genetic instruments that would 
increase the proportion of 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels 
explained by the instrument are needed.
Introduction
Low circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels are 
common in pregnant women.1 The biologically 
active form of vitamin D, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin 
D3 (calcitriol), can suppress renin biosynthesis and 
vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation, modulates 
macrophage activity and cytokine production,2 3 and 
regulates transcription of genes linked to placental 
invasion, normal implantation, and angiogenesis.4 
Therefore, vitamin D status is a plausible causal factor 
in gestational hypertension and pre-eclampsia.
Meta-analyses of observational studies suggest an 
inverse association between 25-hydroxyvitamin D 
concentration and pre-eclampsia, but the potential for 
bias remains.5 6 A recent meta-analysis of three high 
quality randomised controlled trials that evaluated 
vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy found 
no strong evidence of a protective effect on gestational 
hypertension (pooled risk ratio 1.69, 95% confidence

WhAt Is AlreAdy knoWn on thIs topIc
Observational studies find that women with lower levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D 
are at greater risk of pre-eclampsia
Some trials of vitamin D supplementation in pregnancy suggest a potential 
benefit of supplementation but they are small, heterogeneous in timing and 
dose, and have substantial attrition
Therefore, it is unclear whether vitamin D is a cause of pre-eclampsia
WhAt thIs study Adds
A mendelian randomisation analysis of data from several European cohorts, 
showed no evidence to support a causal effect of 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels on 
risk of pre-eclampsia or gestational hypertension
Further mendelian randomisation studies are needed with a larger number of 
women with pre-eclampsia, or which incorporate additional genetic instruments 
thereby increasing the proportion of 25-hydroxyvitamin D explained

Triangulating findings from studies that use 
different designs and analytical approaches increases 
confidence in findings.8 Mendelian randomisation 
analysis uses genetic variants as instrumental variables 
to examine whether an association is causal because 
the allocation of genes at conception is random at 
the population level and therefore independent of 
confounding factors.9 10 This approach examines the 
association of genetically determined levels of the 
exposure in relation to the outcomes of interest. A one 
sample mendelian randomisation analysis requires 
information on the genetic variants, exposure, and 
outcome from the same individual. A two sample 
mendelian randomisation analysis uses estimates 
of the association between the genetic variants and 
the exposure from one sample and the association 
between the genetic variants and the outcome from a 
second sample. One sample mendelian randomisation 
provides researchers with greater control of the 
analysis—for example, they can determine how 
to analyse the exposure (as a continuum, or in 
categories) and examine the association between the 
genetic instruments and measured confounders. Two 
sample mendelian randomisation takes advantage of 
published summary estimates from large scale genome 
wide association studies, which often results in greater 
statistical power. Genome wide association studies 
show robust associations of genetic variants located in 
genes that act in the pathway for vitamin D synthesis 
(CYP2R1 and DHCR7/NADSYN1) and metabolism (eg, 
CYP24A1 and GC) with 25-hydroxyvitamin D level.11 12 
If the alleles associated with lower 25-hydroxyvitamin 
D concentrations are also associated with a greater 
risk of gestational hypertension or pre-eclampsia, 
this points towards a causal effect of lower 
25-hydroxyvitamin D levels.
We investigated the causal effect of 25-hydroxyvi-
tamin D level on pregnancy related hypertensive dis-
orders using genetic variants that are associated with 
25-hydroxyvitamin D levels as instrumental variables 
in a mendelian randomisation analysis.
Methods
study population for multivariable regression and 
one sample mendelian randomisation analyses
Information on genetic variants, antenatal 25-hy-
droxyvitamin D levels, gestational hypertension, and 
pre-eclampsia were available in the Avon Longitudinal 
Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC)13 14 and the 
Generation R Study15 (see the online supplementary 
material for more details). Written informed consent 
was obtained from all participants. We excluded wom-
en with multiple births, of non-European ethnicity, 
and with hypertension before pregnancy. Women of 
non-European ethnicity included those who were not 
of European ancestry based on self reported informa-
tion or principal component analysis of their genome. 
A total of 4066 women from ALSPAC and 3323 women 
from Generation R were available for analysis (eFigs 1 
and 2).
Measurement of antenatal 25-hydroxyvitamin D 
levels
Antenatal 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels were measured 
in serum (ALSPAC) or plasma (Generation R) using 
liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. 
25-hydroxyvitamin 
D 
levels 
were 
natural 
log 
transformed and standardised according to calendar 
time of blood sampling by adding to the population 
mean each person’s residual from a linear regression 
model, including the sine cosine function of calendar 
time of blood sampling as predictors. Additional 
information about the adjustment for season is 
available in the online supplementary material. For 
the conventional multivariable analysis, we evaluated 
25-hydroxyvitamin D levels continuously (by 10% 
decrease) and also categorised according to level 
based on recommendations of the Endocrine Society: 
less than 25 nmol/L, 25-49.9 nmol/L, 50-74.9 nmol/L, 
and 75 nmol/L or higher.16 We did not have adequate 
power to test non-linear associations in the one sample 
mendelian randomisation analysis as there were only 
751 women with gestational hypertension (592 in 
ALSPAC and 159 in Generation R) and 135 women with 
pre-eclampsia (77 in ALSPAC and 58 in Generation R) 
across the two cohorts.
study population for the two sample mendelian 
randomisation analysis
We also conducted a two sample mendelian 
randomisation 
analysis 
of 
pre-eclampsia 
using 
estimates of the associations between the genetic 
instruments and 25-hydroxyvitamin D l levels, and the 
associations between the genetic instruments and pre-
eclampsia from two independent samples. We used 
published estimates of the associations between the 
genetic instruments and 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels 
from 21 European cohorts (n=42 024).17 Estimates 
of the association between the genetic variants and 
pre-eclampsia were available from two case-control 
studies: a subgroup of individuals from a validation 
study of pre-eclampsia nested within the Norwegian 
Mother and Child Cohort Study (MoBa)18 (1513 pre-
eclampsia cases and 971 healthy controls) and the 
UK Genetics of Pre-eclampsia study (GOPEC)19 (1875 
pre-eclampsia cases and 5088 healthy controls). 
Additional information is available in the online 
supplementary material.
genetic instruments for the one and two sample 
mendelian randomisation analyses
Our theoretical framework is shown in eFig 3.

polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes associated with 
vitamin

synthesis 
(CYP2R1/rs10741657 
and 
DHCR7/rs12785878) and metabolism (CYP24A1/

confirmed to be associated with 25-hydroxyvitamin 
D levels.11 12 Information about the genotyping and

quality control procedures is available in the online 
supplementary material. The genetic instruments were 
considered individually and combined into synthesis, 
metabolism, and total genetic risk scores. We created 
weighted genetic risk scores by weighting the 
instruments by the published effect estimates that we 
used for our two sample mendelian randomisation.17 
We also did two separate two sample mendelian 
randomisation analyses of 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels 
less than 75 nmol/L (compared with 75 nmol/L or 
more) and less than 50 nmol/L (compared with 50 
nmol/L or more) for pre-eclampsia; we used published 
estimates of the association between three instruments 
(rs10741657, rs12785878, and rs2282679) with 
these 25-hydroxyvitamin D thresholds.12 Associations 
between the genetic instruments and low levels of 
25-hydroxyvitamin D —such as less than 25 nmol/L—
have not been published. The four SNPs were in 
Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (P≥0.01) and none was in 
linkage disequilibrium (R2≤0.01).
Definition of gestational hypertension and pre-
eclampsia
All cohorts assessed pre-existing hypertension by 
self report. Routine blood pressure and proteinuria 
measurements 
from 
antenatal 
medical 
records 
were used to define gestational hypertension and 
pre-eclampsia. Gestational hypertension and pre-
eclampsia were defined according to the criteria of the 
International Society for the Study of Hypertension in 
Pregnancy.20 Women without pre-existing hypertension 
were classified as having gestational hypertension if 
they had a systolic blood pressure ≥140 mm Hg and/
or diastolic blood pressure ≥90 mm Hg on at least two 
occasions first occurring after 20 gestational weeks. 
Pre-eclampsia was defined as gestational hypertension 
in combination with proteinuria (≥0.3 g/d). For the 
multivariable analysis and the one sample mendelian 
randomisation analysis, the outcome was categorised 
as women without any hypertension either before 
or during pregnancy (reference group), gestational 
hypertension only, and pre-eclampsia.
covariates adjusted for in multivariable regression 
analysis
Information on covariates was available for the multi-
variable analysis: age, parity (0, 1, 2, and ≥3 births), 
prepregnancy body mass index (<18.5, 18.5-24.9, 25-
29.9, and ≥30 kg/m2), educational level (low, medium, 
and high), smoking status during pregnancy (never, 
former/until pregnancy was known, and continued 
smoking), serum calcium concentration (nmol/L) (AL-
SPAC)/energy adjusted calcium intake (mg) (Generation 
R), and gestational week of sample collection. We also 
extracted information on any intake of vitamin D sup-
plements during pregnancy, defined as either a pure 
vitamin D supplement, a multivitamin, or cod liver oil.
statistical analysis
We ran all analyses separately for each cohort and 
combined the results of each cohort using a random 
effects meta-analysis. The degree of heterogeneity 
between the cohorts was estimated using the I2 
statistic.
We first estimated the multivariable adjusted 
associations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D level with 
gestational hypertension and pre-eclampsia using 
multinomial logistic regression in ALSPAC and 
Generation R. Coefficients were multiplied by 
ln(0.9) to reflect the association per 10% decrease in 
25-hydroxyvitamin D level.21 Missing data on covariates 
ranged from 0% to 13% in the two cohorts (eTable 
1). Multivariable imputation of missing covariate 
values was done with chained equations (ALSPAC), or 
according to the fully conditional specification method 
predictive mean matching (Generation R). Twenty 
datasets with imputed values were generated. Details 
of how these methods were applied and comparison 
of observed and imputed data are given in the online 
supplementary material and eTable 2, respectively.
We 
estimated 
the 
association 
between 
the 
genetic instruments and natural log transformed 
25-hydroxyvitamin D values using linear regression. 
The 
exponentiated 
coefficients 
were 
multiplied 
by 100 (exp(coef)−1×100) to reflect the per cent 
change in 25-hydroxyvitamin D level per increase 
in copy number of the risk allele associated with 
lower 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels,21 and we report 
the R2 and F statistic as indicators of the strength of 
the instruments. Our assumption in the mendelian 
randomisation analyses is that genetic variants will 
not be associated with confounding factors, and we 
tested this for observed confounders.
The associations of the genetic instruments with 
gestational hypertension and pre-eclampsia were 
estimated by multinomial logistic regression analysis, 
adjusting for seven genomic principal components 
in ALSPAC. Generation R did not have information 
on genome wide genotypes to generate principal 
components. We also estimated the magnitude of 
the causal effect of 25-hydroxyvitamin D level on 
gestational hypertension and pre-eclampsia using 
a two step instrumental variable analysis. Firstly, we 
estimated the genetically predicted 25-hydroxyvitamin 
D values from a linear regression, where log(25-
hydroxyvitamin D) was the outcome and the genetic 
instrument the exposure. Secondly, we used these 
genetically predicted 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels 
as the exposure in a logistic regression model of the 
outcomes of interest, adjusting for seven principal 
components (ALSPAC only). The standard error of the 
coefficients from the logistic regression model were 
estimated using bootstrapping. We then compared the 
estimates obtained from the multivariable regression 
analysis with the estimates from the instrumental 
variable analysis using a non-parametric bootstrapping 
test. The multivariable and one sample mendelian 
randomisation analyses were done in Stata version 14.
We obtained estimates of the association between 
the genetic variants and pre-eclampsia for the two 
sample mendelian randomisation analysis using 
logistic regression, adjusting for the first five principal

components. We then estimated the causal effect of 
25-hydroxyvitamin D level on pre-eclampsia with 
each SNP as an instrument using the Wald ratio. 
We combined the estimates of the causal effects of 
each single SNP as an instrument using an inverse 
variance weighted method, which is a linear regression 
analysis through the mean 25-hydroxyvitamin D 
level and proportion with pre-eclampsia for each 
individual SNP.22 This method assumes that there 
are no alternative ways for the genetic instruments to 
influence the risk of gestational hypertension or pre-
eclampsia other than through 25-hydroxyvitamin D 
(no horizontal pleiotropy). To assess this assumption, 
we estimated the causal effect using mendelian 
randomisation-Egger regression, which is a similar 
regression method that does not force the regression 
line through the intercept.23 A non-zero intercept value 
from mendelian randomisation-Egger regression is an 
indicator of possible horizontal pleiotropy, whereas the 
slope provides an unbiased estimate in the presence 
of pleiotropy with the assumption that the pleiotropic 
effects of the genetic instruments are uncorrelated with 
their associations with the exposure.23 We assessed 
heterogeneity in the estimated causal effect using the 
individual genetic instruments with the Q statistic. For 
the secondary analysis of the two 25-hydroxyvitamin D 
cut-off levels, the associations are the odds ratio for pre-
eclampsia per unit increase in the log(odds) of having 
a 25-hydroxyvitamin D level below the cut-off. The two 
sample mendelian randomisation analysis was done in 
R 3.2.2 (R Foundation, www.R-project.org).
Patient and public involvement
No patients were involved in setting the research 
question or the outcome measures, nor were they 
involved in developing plans for recruitment, design, or 
implementation of the study. No patients were asked to 
advise on interpretation or writing up of results. There 
are no plans to disseminate the results of the research 
to study participants or the relevant patient community.

Distribution of 25-hydroxyvitamin D and genetic 
instruments by background characteristics
Supplementary eTable 1 shows the characteristics of 
the 7389 women included in the one sample mendelian 
randomisation analysis. In the two cohorts, 751 women 
had gestational hypertension (592 in ALSPAC and 159 
in Generation R) and 135 had pre-eclampsia (77 in 
ALSPAC and 58 in Generation R). The distribution of 
background characteristics was similar in the observed 
and imputed datasets (eTable 2). 25-hydroxyvitamin D 
level was positively associated with age (difference 1-2 
years) and education (difference in proportion with 
high education 7-9%) in both cohorts, and inversely 
associated with smoking (difference in proportion 
of women who smoked during pregnancy 13-20%) 
and body mass index (difference in proportion with 
normal body mass index 6-38%) (eTables 3 and 4). In 
contrast, the genetic instruments showed no strong 
evidence of associations with the confounding factors 
(eTables 5 and 6). Notably, we did not observe strong 
evidence of an association between intake of vitamin D 
supplements and the genetic instruments.
association of 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels with 
gestational hypertension and pre-eclampsia: 
multivariable regression analysis
We did not find strong evidence of any (linear or non-
linear) association between 25-hydroxyvitamin D level 
and gestational hypertension in the multivariable 
analysis (eTable 7). However, we observed weak evidence 
of a linear association between 25-hydroxyvitamin 
D level and pre-eclampsia (pooled adjusted relative 
risk 1.03 (95% confidence interval 1.00 to 1.07) per 
10% decrease; eTable 7). A 25-hydroxyvitamin D level 
less than 25 nmol/L was associated with a twofold 
increased risk of pre-eclampsia compared with levels of 
75 nmol/L or more (pooled adjusted relative risk 2.04 
(1.02 to 4.07); eTable 7).
strength of genetic variants as instruments for 
25-hydroxyvitamin D level
Supplementary eTable 8 shows the strength of the 
genetic instruments in predicting 25-hydroxyvitamin 
D level in ALSPAC and Generation R. The synthesis 
score explained 0.2% (F=9, n=4062 and 0.6% (F=21, 
n=3275) of the variation in 25-hydroxyvitamin D lev-
els in ALSPAC and Generation R, respectively. In com-
parison, the metabolism score explained 1.2% (F=49, 
n=3920) and 1.5% (F=52, n=3284) of the variation in 
25-hydroxyvitamin D levels in ALSPAC and Generation 
R, respectively. For the published estimates of the as-
sociations of the genetic instruments and 25-hydrox-
yvitamin D level used for the two sample mendelian 
randomisation analysis, the synthesis score explained 
0.6% of the variation in 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels 
(F=230, n=35 873), whereas the metabolism score ex-
plained 1.3% of the variation in 25-hydroxyvitamin D 
levels (F=489, n=38 191).17
association of 25-hydroxyvitamin D level with 
gestational hypertension and pre-eclampsia: one 
sample mendelian randomisation analysis
We found no consistent evidence of any associations 
of the three genetic risk scores with gestational 
hypertension or pre-eclampsia in the two cohorts (fig 
1). When we evaluated the four SNPs individually, 
we found weak evidence of an association between 
a greater copy number of the 25-hydroxyvitamin 
D risk allele in rs2282679 and pre-eclampsia 
(eTable 9). The instrumental variable analysis also 
showed no consistent evidence of a causal linear 
effect of 25-hydroxyvitamin D level on the risk of 
gestational 
hypertension 
or 
pre-eclampsia: 
the 
odds ratio for gestational hypertension was 0.90 
(95% confidence interval 0.78 to 1.03) per 10% 
decrease in 25-hydroxyvitamin D level, and for pre-
eclampsia was 1.19 (0.92 to 1.52) per 10% decrease 
in 25-hydroxyvitamin D level, when using the total 
genetic risk score as the instrument (fig 2 and eTable

and instrumental variable analyses, no strong evidence 
was found that the estimates differed (in ALSPAC, 
P=0.17 for gestational hypertension and 0.77 for pre-
eclampsia; in Generation R, P=0.10 for gestational 
hypertension and 0.12 for pre-eclampsia). Based on a 
question raised in the review process, since rs6013897 
was not a strong instrument for 25-hydroxyvitamin D 
levels, we conducted an analysis where we excluded 
rs6013897 from the total genetic risk score. This 
sensitivity analysis did not change our findings: the 
odds ratio for gestational hypertension was 0.91 (0.80 
to 1.04) per 10% decrease in 25-hydroxyvitamin D 
level, and for pre-eclampsia was 1.21 (0.94 to 1.57) 
per 10% decrease in 25-hydroxyvitamin D level.
association of 25-hydroxyvitamin D level with 
pre-eclampsia: two sample mendelian  
randomisation analysis
Supplementary eTable11 shows the risk allele 
frequencies in the two-case control samples of 
 
pre-eclampsia (MoBa and GOPEC). Similar to the one 
sample mendelian randomisation analysis, we found 
no associations between the genetic instruments for 
25-hydroxyvitamin D levels and pre-eclampsia in the 
two sample mendelian randomisation analysis (fig 3 
and eTable 12), and no evidence of a causal linear effect 
in the formal two sample mendelian randomisation 
analysis, (odds ratio 0.98 (95% confidence interval 
0.89 to 1.07) per 10% decrease in 25-hydroxyvitamin 
D level (fig 4 and eTable 13). The P values from the 
Q statistic were 0.58 in GOPEC and 0.89 in MoBa 
(inverse variance weighted method), indicating no 
evidence of heterogeneity in the estimates of the 
genetic instruments. Furthermore, we found no 
strong evidence of horizontal pleiotropy: mendelian 
randomisation-Egger intercept −0.06 (P=0.34) in 
GOPEC and 0.04 (P=0.56) in MoBa. Similar to what we 
observed in the one sample mendelian randomisation 
analysis, excluding rs6013897 from the total genetic 
risk score did not change our findings, odds ratio

0.97 (0.88 to 1.08) per 10% decrease in 25-hydro-
xyvitamin D levels. In the two sample mendelian 
randomisation analysis of 25-hydroxyvitamin D cut-
off levels, no strong evidence was found of a causal 
effect of 25-hydroxyvitamin D level on the risk of 
pre-eclampsia: the odds ratio for pre-eclampsia was 
0.96 (0.80 to 1.15) per unit increase in the log(odds) 
of having a 25-hydroxyvitamin D level less than 75 
nmol/L and 0.93 (0.73 to 1.19) per unit increase in the 
log(odds) of having a 25-hydroxyvitamin D level less 
than 50 nmol/L (fig 5 and eTable 14).
discussion
A lower 25-hydroxyvitamin D level was weakly 
associated with a lower risk of gestational hypertension 
and higher risk of pre-eclampsia in the one sample 
mendelian randomisation analysis. This could indicate 
that the null association between 25-hydroxyvitamin D 
level and gestational hypertension in the multivariable 
analysis was influenced by unobserved confounding. 
Further evidence from larger studies is needed 
to provide conclusive evidence. Furthermore, no 
evidence was found of an association between 
25-hydroxyvitamin D level and pre-eclampsia in the 
larger two sample mendelian randomisation. Nor did 
we find any appreciable evidence of a causal effect of 
25-hydroxyvitamin D levels less than 75 nmol/L or less 
than 50 nmol/L on the risk of pre-eclampsia.
strengths and limitations of this study
The main strengths of our study are the use of 
genetic variants as instrumental variables to reduce 
the possibility of confounding, and our inclusion of 
multiple cohorts. The methods for ascertaining outcome 
were similar for the cohorts but we acknowledge a 
difference in the proportion of women with gestational 
hypertension in ALSPAC (15%) and Generation R 
(5%) cohorts. This is likely explained by the fact that

Generation R relied on registered diagnoses in the 
antenatal charts, whereas ALSPAC abstracted blood 
pressure and proteinuria measures from the charts and 
then defined the outcomes according to the guidelines. 
We accounted for some observed heterogeneity in 
the associations between the cohorts, which might 
be explained by the difference in ascertaining the 
outcome, by running a random effects meta-analysis 
instead of a fixed effects meta-analysis. Mendelian 
randomisation analysis has limitations. Horizontal 
pleiotropy could bias our findings. We observed no 
consistent evidence of associations between the genetic 
instruments and a range of background characteristics 
in the two pregnancy cohorts included in the one 
sample mendelian randomisation analysis. This might 
be explained by the modest sample size. However, 
a study of 6877 Europeans in the 1958 British Birth 
Cohort reported no associations between the four 
genetic instruments that we used in the current study 
and a wide range of potential pleiotropic pathways, 
including oily fish consumption, smoking, body 
mass index, abdominal obesity, social class, and C 
reactive protein levels.24 Therefore, no strong evidence 
exists of pleiotropy for the genetic instruments for 
25-hydroxyvitamin D. This is further supported by 
the findings of the mendelian randomisation-Egger 
regression that had an intercept of −0.06 (P=0.34) in 
GOPEC and 0.04 (P=0.56) in MoBa.23 Our analyses were 
restricted to pregnant women. If vitamin D status affects 
fertility, this might have resulted in selection bias.25 26
We explored the association between the genetic in-
struments and intake of vitamin D supplements because 
if women with lower genetically predicted 25-hydrox-
yvitamin D levels are more likely to take supplements, 
this could theoretically distort our findings. The propor-
tion of women who took vitamin D supplements during 
pregnancy differed in the two cohorts, which might 
reflect cultural, socioeconomic, or policy differences. 
However, we did not see strong evidence of an associ-
ation between the genetic instruments and intake of 
vitamin D supplements in ALSPAC or Generation R. In 
addition, associations between the genetic instruments 
and measured 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels were similar 
to previous reports.
Finally, in the two sample mendelian randomisation 
analysis, we used estimates for the associations of the 
genetic instruments with 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels 
and pre-eclampsia from the largest samples available. 
Our two sample mendelian randomisation analysis of 
pre-eclampsia (3388 cases and 6059 controls), using 
the total genetic risk score as an instrument (explaining 
about 2% of the variation in 25-hydroxyvitamin D 
levels), was adequately powered (80%) to detect an 
odds ratio of 1.5 per standard deviation decrease in 
25-hydroxyvitamin D level.27 Translating this to the 
association we were able to detect for a 10% decrease 
in 25-hydroxyvitamin D level (0.105 on the log 
scale), using the estimate of the standard deviation of 
natural log transformed 25-hydroxyvitamin D level in 
ALSPAC (0.45), this is equivalent to an odds of 1.10 
per 10% decrease in 25-hydroxyvitamin D level (exp 
((ln(1.5)/0.45)×0.105). We therefore acknowledge that 
a more modest effect might be present that we were not 
able to detect. Future mendelian randomisation studies 
with a larger number of women with pre-eclampsia are 
therefore needed.
comparison with other studies
Previous observational studies of 25-hydroxyvitamin 
D level and risk of pre-eclampsia report conflicting 
findings, as summarised in meta-analyses,5 6 which 
report a pooled odds ratio for pre-eclampsia of 
1.70 (95% confidence interval 1.25 to 2.58) when 
comparing women with 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels 
less than 75 nmol/L with those with levels of 75 
nmol/L or more.5 Estimates of the associations vary 
according to study design, whether the original 
studies had adjusted for important confounders, 
the categorisation of 25-hydroxyvitamin D, and 
25-hydroxyvitamin D quantification method. Previous 
studies of 25-hydroxyvitamin D level and gestational 
hypertension also reported conflicting findings.28-31
Our findings are more in line with a recent systematic 
review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled 
trials of vitamin D supplementation in pregnancy. 
The pooled risk ratio of pre-eclampsia was 1.09 (95% 
confidence interval 0.43 to 2.76), with a high degree 
of heterogeneity in the effects estimates between 
the three included trials (I2=67%).7 The sizes of the 
trials were modest, ranging between about 70 and 
200 women in each study arm.32-34 The intervention 
also varied between the three studies, with 50 000 
IU (1250 µg) of vitamin D3 given once every two 
weeks in two trials and 4000 (100 µg) IU vitamin D3 
given daily in one trial.32-34 The authors of the meta-
analysis attribute the difference between their pooled 
estimate and the results of previous meta-analyses to 
their stricter exclusion criteria based on trial quality.7 
We found four more ongoing trials looking at vitamin 
D supplementation and pre-eclampsia registered on 
ClinicalTrials.gov. The largest one aims to recruit a 
total of 460 women across the intervention arms.
Genetic predisposition to higher 25-hydroxyvitamin 
D levels and supplementation are not equivalent.35 
While a randomised controlled trial is done at a 
given time point or period, mendelian randomisation 
estimates the effect of a lifelong difference in levels of the 
exposure. Mendelian randomisation might therefore 
not be the best approach if the association between the 
genetic instruments and the exposure of interest varies 
over the life course, or if there is a critical period for an 
effect of the exposure on the outcome of interest.8 The 
pathogenesis of pre-eclampsia likely starts during early 
pregnancy36 and therefore women’s nutrient status 
before pregnancy or at conception and during the first 
trimester may be of particular relevance. However, we 
are unaware of any evidence to support the notion that 
the association between the genetic instruments and 
25-hydroxyvitamin D level varies greatly over the life 
course. Furthermore, genetically determined changes 
in exposure levels are usually small and assumed to 
be uniform in the population, whereas interventions

assessed in randomised controlled trials have greater 
effects. For all of these reasons, extrapolating findings 
from a mendelian randomisation analysis beyond the 
modest genetic effect might not be valid.35
Policy implications
Debate continues about the recommendations for 
vitamin D intake in pregnancy.37 The US Institute of 
Medicine has set a recommended dietary allowance 
for vitamin D for pregnant and lactating women of 
600 IU (15 µg) daily,38 while the UK National Health 
Service recommends that all adults (including pregnant 
women) consume about 400 IU (10 µg) each day,39 and 
the Health Council of the Netherlands suggests that all 
pregnant women take 400 IU (10 µg) of vitamin D daily. 
In Norway, the health directorate recommends that 
pregnant women take one tablespoon of cod liver oil 
each day, which also contains 400 IU (10 µg) of vitamin 
D.40 According to the World Health Organization, 
evidence recommending vitamin D supplementation for 
women during pregnancy to reduce adverse pregnancy 
outcomes is insufficient.41 Our findings support the 
current WHO position. Mendelian randomisation 
studies with a greater number of women with pre-
eclampsia will provide additional evidence to support 
or negate a causal effect of vitamin D in pre-eclampsia. 
The next step (should such an effect be likely) would 
require large, well conducted trials of vitamin D 
supplementation. In particular, it is important to find 
out whether the benefit of vitamin D supplementation 
varies by ethnic group—most studies to date have 
included only individuals of European origin—and a 
broad range of baseline 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels.
conclusion
Mendelian randomisation analyses using the largest 
available sample yielded no strong evidence to support 
a causal effect of vitamin D status on gestational 
hypertension or pre-eclampsia. Further mendelian 
randomisation studies are needed with a larger number 
of women with pre-eclampsia, or which incorporate 
additional genetic instruments thereby increasing 
the proportion of 25-hydroxyvitamin D explained. In 
combination with adequately powered clinical trials, 
this could help finally establish whether vitamin D status 
has a role in pregnancy related hypertensive disorders.
