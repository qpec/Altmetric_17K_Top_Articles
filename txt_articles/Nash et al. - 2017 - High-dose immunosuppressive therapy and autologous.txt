High-dose immunosuppressive therapy
and autologous HCT for
relapsing-remitting MS
ABSTRACT
Objective: To evaluate the safety, efficacy, and durability of multiple sclerosis (MS) disease sta-
bilization after high-dose immunosuppressive therapy (HDIT) and autologous hematopoietic cell
transplantation (HCT).
Methods: High-Dose Immunosuppression and Autologous Transplantation for Multiple Sclerosis
(HALT-MS) is a phase II clinical trial of HDIT/HCT for patients with relapsing-remitting (RR) MS who
experienced relapses with disability progression (Expanded Disability Status Scale [EDSS] 3.0–5.5)
while on MS disease-modifying therapy. The primary endpoint was event-free survival (EFS), defined
as survival without death or disease activity from any one of: disability progression, relapse, or new
lesions on MRI. Participants were evaluated through 5 years posttransplant. Toxicities were reported
using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (AE).
Results: Twenty-five participants were evaluated for transplant and 24 participants underwent
HDIT/HCT. Median follow-up was 62 months (range 12–72). EFS was 69.2% (90% confidence
interval [CI] 50.2–82.1). Progression-free survival, clinical relapse-free survival, and MRI activity-
free survival were 91.3% (90% CI 74.7%–97.2%), 86.9% (90% CI 69.5%–94.7%), and 86.3%
(90% CI 68.1%–94.5%), respectively. AE due to HDIT/HCT were consistent with expected
toxicities and there were no significant late neurologic adverse effects noted. Improvements were
noted in neurologic disability with a median change in EDSS of 20.5 (interquartile range 21.5 to
0.0; p 5 0.001) among participants who survived and completed the study.
Conclusion: HDIT/HCT without maintenance therapy was effective for inducing long-term
sustained remissions of active RRMS at 5 years.
ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00288626.
Classification of evidence: This study provides Class IV evidence that participants with RRMS expe-
rienced sustained remissions with toxicities as expected from HDIT/HCT. Neurology® 2017;88:842–852

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease resulting in demyelination and loss of CNS
neurons. The High-Dose Immunosuppression and Autologous Transplantation for Multiple
Sclerosis (HALT-MS) clinical trial was initiated in participants with relapsing-remitting MS
(RRMS); that is, with active CNS inflammation relatively early in the disease course.1 We

 hypothesized that high-dose immunosuppres-
sive therapy (HDIT) and autologous hemato-
poietic cell transplantation (HCT) would
remove disease-causing cells and induce a reset
of the immune system, thereby controlling
disease.2,3 Participants had substantial disabil-
ity progression (Expanded Disability Status
Scale [EDSS] 3.0–5.5) and failure of MS
disease-modifying therapy (DMT) to control
disease activity. At 3 years after HDIT/HCT
and, importantly, with no posttransplant
immunosuppressive
therapy
administered,
event-free survival (EFS) was 78%,1 defined
as absence of progression, relapse activity, or
new MRI lesions. Further, peritransplant
adverse events (AE) were consistent with those
routinely observed after HDIT/HCT,1 and
treatment-related mortality was zero.1 In this
report, outcomes of participants followed at
least 5 years are described.
Outcomes at 5 years for participants in the
HALT-MS clinical trial compare favorably to
results from nontransplant studies that enrolled
participants with less severe MS and followed
them for only 2–3 years.4 HALT-MS is among
the first MS treatment clinical trials to use
a composite endpoint for EFS that is compa-
rable, but not identical, to no evidence of MS
disease activity (NEDA) (including MRI activ-
ity, relapse, or progression of disability)4,5 as
the primary endpoint. Advantages of the com-
posite endpoint include that (1) it is a sensitive
indicator of MS disease activity as compared to
either relapse activity or progression of disabil-
ity alone and (2) it facilitates comparison of
HDIT/HCT to other MS DMT.4 For current
Food
and
Drug
Administration
(FDA)–
approved therapies for MS, including glatir-
amer acetate or interferon-b-1a (first-line
treatments6), or natalizumab or alemtuzumab
(second-line treatments6), NEDA levels of
19%, 21%, 37%, and 39%, respectively, were
observed with follow-up of 2–3 years after ini-
tiation of study treatment.5–8 In an observa-
tional clinical cohort in which participants
received no or multiple different therapies,
NEDA was maintained at 1 year in 46%, but
at 7 years in only 7% of participants with MS.9
METHODS Details of the patient population, procedures,
evaluations, and study design have been reported.1
Patients. Eligible patients were 18–60 years of age and had MS
by McDonald criteria10 with (1) RRMS; (2) EDSS11 3.0–5.5 at
baseline; (3) lesions on brain MRI consistent with MS; (4) disease
duration ,15 years; and (5) failure of DMT, defined as $2
clinical relapses over 18 months while on therapy and associated
with EDSS increase (by 1.0 for EDSS of 3.0–3.5 or by 0.5 for
EDSS of 4.0–5.5 and sustained $4 weeks). Eligibility was deter-
mined by a MS Review Panel (MSRP).1
Standard protocol approvals, registrations, and patient
consent. The clinical study (protocol ITN033AI; BB-IND
12164; type II DMF BB-IND 118211) was approved by
institutional review boards at participating sites and participants
provided
written
informed
consent.
The
clinicaltrials.gov
registration number is NCT00288626.
Study design. This is a prospective, open-label, single-arm,
multicenter phase II clinical trial.
Procedures. Autologous peripheral blood stem cells were col-
lected, CD34-selected, and stored as described.1 High-dose
chemotherapy was carmustine (BCNU) 300 mg/m2 on day 26,
etoposide 200 mg/m2 and cytarabine 200 mg/m2 daily from day
25 to 22, and melphalan 140 mg/m2 on day 21 (BEAM).1,12
Rabbit antithymocyte globulin (2.5 mg/kg/d) was administered on
days 22 and 21. On day 0, CD341 hematopoietic progenitor
cells were thawed and infused. Filgrastim (5 mg/kg/d) was
administered from day 15 until recovery of blood counts.
Prednisone was administered (0.5 mg/kg/d) from day 17 to
121 and then tapered over 2 weeks to prevent engraftment
syndrome. Supportive care was administered as described.13
Primary endpoint and study evaluations. The primary end-
point was time until treatment failure or EFS during 5 years
post-HCT, defined as the first event of death or disease activity
from any one of: (1) disability progression, (2) relapse, or (3) new
lesions on MRI. Disability progression was defined as a change in
EDSS performed at least 6 months after transplant of .0.5 as
compared to EDSS at baseline and confirmed 3 months later.1
Relapse was defined as new neurologic symptoms lasting over 48
hours. The MRI endpoint was 2 or more gadolinium-enhancing or
new T2-weighted lesions at 1 year or longer after transplant. The
Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite (MSFC) and the Multiple
Sclerosis
Impact
Scale
(MSIS-29)
were
performed
before
mobilization of stem cells, at 16 months, and then annually to
end of study. Participants were contacted by telephone between
annual visits at an interval of 3 months and if there were new
neurologic symptoms, they were evaluated.
Brain MRI was performed at screening post-MSRP, baseline, 12
months, 16 months, and then annually to 15 years, on scanners
with 1.5T field strength. Scans were analyzed centrally (NeuroRx,
Montreal, Canada). The brain MRI at 12 months was the post-
treatment reference scan for assessment of treatment failure. The pre-
treatment screening scan was the reference for brain volume changes.
Toxicities were reported by the National Cancer Institute
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE)
version 3.0. AE $ grade 2 were recorded from 3 to 5 years of
the study.
Oligoclonal bands (OCB) were identified/quantified by 2
independent experienced readers following isoelectric focusing
on agarose and in-gel enzyme-enhanced immunostaining using
an FDA-approved method (Sebia [Norcross, GA] Isofocusing
Gel), following consensus guidelines.14 Total immunoglobulin
G (IgG) concentrations were measured in CSF and serum speci-
mens to allow normalization of the concentration of IgG applied
to each gel lane. Participant paired CSF and serum samples from

 baseline, 2 years, and 4 years posttransplant were assayed on the
same gel for accurate comparison of bands. Bands visualized in
CSF but not in paired serum specimens were denoted as CSF-
specific. Disappearance/resolution of CSF-specific bands and
appearance of novel CSF-specific bands in the 12 years and
14 years specimens as compared to the baseline sample of each
participant were recorded. Analyses were performed in a CLIA-
certified laboratory (Department of Laboratory Medicine, Uni-
versity of Washington, Seattle).
Statistics. EFS was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method to
assess the composite primary endpoint. Similar analyses were
conducted for the individual components of disability progression,
clinical relapse, new MRI lesions, and death to produce progression-
free, relapse-free, MRI activity-free, and overall survival estimates.
Follow-up for any component was not censored by earlier events so
that
each
has
an
interpretation
independent
of
the
other
components. Standard errors were derived using the Greenwood
formula and used to generate 90% confidence intervals (CIs).
Secondary outcomes included change in T1 and T2 lesion vol-
umes, total brain volume, EDSS, MSFC, and MSIS. Each compo-
nent of the MSFC was transformed into a Z score using the
National MS Society Task Force Database reference population.15
Significant change from baseline was tested using the Wilcoxon
signed-rank test. The screening measurement was used as the
reference for percent change in brain volume, while the baseline
visit was used for all other endpoints. A limitation of this study is
that for secondary outcomes no corrections have been made for
multiple comparisons, as this pilot study was hypothesis-
generating and not a formal test of specific hypotheses.
All analyses were performed using SAS version 9.3 (Cary,
NC) or higher. Datasets for the analyses are available through
TrialShare, a public website managed by the Immune Tolerance
Network (https://www.itntrialshare.org/HALTMS_5yr.url).
Primary research question. To assess the 5-year durability of
disease stabilization in patients with MS after HDIT and
autologous HCT.
Classification of evidence. This study provides Class IV evi-
dence that participants with RRMS experienced sustained remis-
sions with toxicities as expected from HDIT/HCT.
RESULTS Patient
characteristics. Twenty-five pa-
tients were consented and 24 patients underwent
HDIT/HCT (figure 1, and figure e-1 and table e-1
at Neurology.org). The 25 entering participants had
median age 37 years (interquartile range [IQR] 31–
42), with 17 (68%) women. Disease duration was 4.9
years (median; IQR 2.5–7.3); baseline EDSS was 4.5
(median; IQR, 4.0–5.0). Participants had previously
failed 3 (median; IQR 2–4) nontransplant MS
medications.
Adverse events. AEs to 3 years after transplant were
described,1 and were consistent with toxic effects
associated with HDIT/HCT, including predomi-
nantly
cytopenias
and
infections;
no
acute
treatment-related neurologic AE were observed.1
Beyond

occurred (table 1); no grade 4 AEs were observed.
Two participants had disease progression and died
(grade 5 AE) at .2.5 years and .3.5 years after
transplant and were reported.1 A third participant also
had disease progression at 15 months and died at 4.5
years post-HCT. No information was available on the
events leading up to death. The final cause of death
was cardiopulmonary arrest. No death was attributed
to transplant.
Evaluation of disease. The estimated EFS probability
was 73.8% (90% CI 55.0%–85.7%) at 4 years and
69.2% (90% CI 50.2%–82.1%) at 5 years. Of 24
participants transplanted, 7 did not maintain EFS by
close of follow-up (figure 2, A–B and table e-2) by an
increase in EDSS .0.5 (n 5 2), clinical relapse (n 5 3),
or development of new MRI lesions (n 5 2). The
5-year progression-free survival was 91.3% (90% CI
74.7%–97.2%), relapse-free survival was 86.9%
(90% CI 69.5%–94.7%), MRI activity-free survival
was 86.3% (90% CI 68.1%–94.5%), and overall
survival
was
86.3%
(90%
CI
68.3%–94.5%)
(figure 2, C–F, and table e-2).
Three of 24 participants transplanted did not
maintain EFS due to clinical relapse, at 5.1, 22.2,
and 32.6 months. However, for all participants,
including those failing to maintain EFS, relapse activ-
ity was reduced posttransplant as compared to pre-
treatment (figure 1).
The EDSS score, for participants who survived
and completed the study, improved after transplant
with a median change from baseline of 20.50 (IQR
21.5 to 0.0) at 5 years (p 5 0.001; figure 3A and
table e-3). Specifically, as compared to baseline pre-
transplant, 15 participants had improvement ($0.5
decrease) in EDSS, 5 remained stable (no change),
and 4 progressed ($0.5 increase) at the time of their
last EDSS assessment, with 2 failing to maintain EFS
due to progression at 15.2 and 18.9 months. The
MSFC improved from baseline (figure 3, B–E, and
table e-3) by 1 year and this persisted through 3 years
after transplant, but by year 5 significant improve-
ment was not sustained (p 5 0.303). MSIS-29 qual-
ity of life (QoL) was improved at 3 years; however,
only a trend towards improvement was noted at the
end of the study (median 28.50; IQR 223 to 3.5;
p 5 0.091) (figure 3F and table e-3).
MRI assessments. Two participants failed to maintain
EFS at 45.6 and 48.4 months posttransplant due to
development of new brain gadolinium-enhancing
lesions or T2 lesions (figure 4, A and B). For all
participants, T2 lesion volume decreased during
follow-up starting at 6 months; at 5 years, there was
still a decrease (p , 0.001) (figure 4C). T1 lesion
volume
demonstrated
a

increase
from
baseline and at year 5 remained different from zero
(p 5 0.015) (figure 4D). Brain volume was decreased
at 6 months as compared to baseline, but subsequently
appeared to stabilize (figure 4E). Thus, while brain

 volume at the end of the study was decreased
compared to baseline, there was no change in brain
volume from year 3 to the end of the study.
OCB evaluation. To investigate the effect of transplant
on presence of OCB in the CSF, participant samples
were analyzed at baseline and at 2 and 4 years post-
HCT. There was persistence but a reduction in
OCB number in the CSF at 2 years (figure e-2),
with a reduction of CSF IgG levels after transplant.

for
participants with highly active RRMS in the HALT-
MS study, 69.2% of participants remained event-free
without evidence of relapse, disability progression,
or new MRI lesions. These outcomes are highly
promising, as compared to non-HCT treatments,4 and
consistent with other contemporary investigations of
autologous HCT for similarly afflicted individuals.16–21
Highly active RRMS is the target population for
contemporary investigations of HDIT/HCT for MS.
Uniquely, among participants involved in earlier explor-
atory studies, those with RRMS demonstrated favorable
responses, including some who experienced improved
Figure 1
Patient-level pretransplant characteristics and outcomes
Patient-level pretransplant characteristics and study outcomes are presented for the 24 transplanted participants. Time is measured in months relative to day
0, the day of graft infusion. The eligibility window is defined as the period of time beginning 18 months prior to the screening visit. At screening, the number of
relapses, as defined in the protocol, that occurred during the eligibility window were identified retrospectively and documented in the clinical database, for the
purpose of determining eligibility. The period of screening to transplant is defined as the time from determination of protocol eligibility until day 0. To obtain
a more complete understanding of the events that occurred during the time from screening to day 0, we retrospectively investigated reports of multiple scle-
rosis (MS) attack, to determine if the participant had met the protocol definition of relapse, or if the event was a less severe MS worsening event. MS worsening
is a new neurologic sign or symptom that does not meet criteria for relapse, and was documented only during the period from screening to day 0. Patients 2, 6,
14, 15, 19, and 22 experienced an Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) increase of at least 0.5 during the period of screening to transplant. Study com-
pletion for some participants occurred beyond the 28-day visit window for the year 5 visit, due to scheduling difficulties. The participant flow diagram is pre-
sented as figure e-1 in the current publication. A total of 18 participants completed the year 4 assessment and 17 participants completed the year 5
assessment. MS disease activity is reduced for participants posttransplant as compared to prior to treatment. DMT 5 disease-modifying therapy.

 EDSS, while those with advanced primary progressive
MS or secondary progressive MS (SPMS) continued
to experience disability progression, possibly due to an
irreversible neurodegenerative process with progression
resulting from earlier immunologic injury.12,22–25
Outcomes of HDIT with autologous HCT are sim-
ilar across contemporary clinical trials including HALT-
MS with regard to inducing sustained remissions and
stability of neurologic function in participants with
RRMS.4 For other contemporary investigations in
which disease activity-free survival was determined,
with events consisting of death or disease activity from
any one of EDSS progression, relapse activity, or new
MRI lesions, 68% of participants at 5 years in the
Swedish experience,16 68% of participants at 4 years
at Northwestern University,17 and 69.6% of partici-
pants at 3 years in the Canadian study18 remained
event-free. Further, in the Canadian study, none of
24 participants experienced relapses or new MRI activ-
ity and only 7 of 24 participants (29%) experienced
further disability progression at a median follow-up of
6.7 years.18 For 25 participants with RRMS reported
from
Italy,
relapse-free
survival
was
70%
and
progression-free survival was 71% at 5 years.19
As detailed in our interim report, AEs observed in
the HALT-MS study were consistent with those rou-
tinely observed after HDIT/HCT.1 AEs recorded at 4
and 5 years were not related to the transplant and, in
general, were not considered severe. A third death
occurred at 4.5 years posttransplant due to cardiore-
spiratory arrest; the 2 deaths reported previously1
were also late posttransplant at .2.5 and .3.5 years.
These participants had all experienced worsening of
MS, and no death was related to the study treatment.
In other contemporary studies of HDIT/HCT for
RRMS, mortality has been 0%–4%.16–19,21,26 Regarding
treatment-related mortality, 1 death among 24 partic-
ipants in the Canadian study18 and 2 deaths among 74
participants in the Italian experience were attributed to
transplant-related complications (a third death in that
series also occurred within 3 months of transplant but
was attributed to other causes).19 One death occurred
among 151 participants at Northwestern University, at
30 months posttransplant, from hypertensive cardiovas-
cular disease.17 Overall survival in these studies has oth-
erwise been 100% for the Autologous Stem Cell
Transplantation International MS Trial (ASTIMS) ran-
domized study (9 participants received transplant)21
and for the Swedish prospective observational study
of 48 participants.16 These data are consistent with
the
recent
EBMT
registry
report
of
100-day,
treatment-related mortality of 2% (for 345 MS cases),
which was observed to be lower in experienced
centers.26 In comparison, in a nontransplant group of
patients with MS with EDSS of 3.5–5.5, MS-related
mortality was 19% at 20 years of follow-up.27

a AEs from prior to start of mobilization through completion of year 3 post– hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) are
reported in greater detail in the interim report for this study (Nash et al.,1 table 2).
b Three deaths occurred (grade 5 AEs) at 2.6, 3.9, and 4.5 years after HCT. All participants had previously experienced
worsening of multiple sclerosis and met primary endpoint. No death was attributed to transplant.
c Thirty-eight (28%) of the grade 3 AEs and 85 (90%) of the grade 4 AEs were hematopoietic or gastrointestinal.
d Participants who experienced one or more adverse events are counted only once.
e Percentages for the number of participants with AEs are based on the number of participants in the safety population.
f One participant who was mobilized, but not subsequently transplanted, is included. This participant experienced 3 AEs,
which all began between 10 and 12 days after the start of mobilization. These events are included in the “mobilization until
start of conditioning” time category. The events include a grade 3 arteriovenous malformation, a grade 3 lymphopenia, and
a grade 4 pulmonary embolism.

 In another report of non-transplant patients with MS
with an EDSS of 3.0–5.5, mortality was 22% at 15
years.28 Although there were no treatment-related
deaths in the HALT-MS study, there is a significant
risk associated with transplant and patients require
counseling regarding this.

MRI). Note that the MRI event that occurred at 11.9 months was not a primary endpoint event, but rather an event that occurred subsequently after the participant met
primary endpoint via clinical relapse at 5.1 months. (F) Overall survival. For each of the 3 deaths, the participant had previously met primary endpoint. In the analysis of
the individual components comprising event-free survival (C–F), follow-up for any component was not censored by earlier events (see text).

 The primary goal of HDIT/HCT in the HALT-
MS clinical trial was to suppress active disease and
prevent further disability. In addition, we note that
participants who survived and completed the study
experienced a median improvement in EDSS by
a score of 0.5. In the contemporary Italian experience,

participant, and thus this individual met primary endpoint. (B) New T2 lesions since previous visit. The new T2 lesions seen at year 4 are in one individual, who met
primary endpoint. (C) T2 lesion volume (mL) change from baseline. There was a decrease in T2 lesion volume at year 5 (p , 0.001). (D) T1 lesion volume (mL) change
from baseline. There was an increase in T1 lesion volume at year 5 (p 5 0.015). (E) Percentage of change in brain volume from screening. At year 5, brain volume was
significantly decreased compared to baseline (p , 0.001); however, there was stabilization in brain volume from year 3 to 5 (p 5 0.311) after transplant.

 8 of 25 (31%) participants with RRMS experienced
improvement of .1 EDSS point at 6–12 months
after HDIT/HCT, compared with 1 of 36 with
SPMS.19 At Northwestern University, it was noted
that 17 of 21 (81%) participants with RRMS had
an EDSS improvement of at least 1 point at a mean
of 37 months post-HCT.20 In a larger study that
included RRMS and SPMS from the same group,
the baseline EDSS was 4.0, which improved to 2.5
at 4 years after HDIT/HCT.17 Therefore, patients
with RRMS and relatively low EDSS scores may have
more potential for recovery of neurologic function as
compared to those with greater disability.
A markedly reduced risk of recurrent or new le-
sions on MRI has been observed for contemporary
studies of HDIT/HCT for RRMS. This is important
because appearance of new MRI lesions has been
demonstrated to be correlated with relapse activity29
and with progression.30 For HALT-MS, a decrease in
T2 lesion volume was observed through 5 years, and
only 2 participants failed to maintain EFS by devel-
oping new lesions late after transplant. In the ASTIMS
randomized study, HDIT/HCT significantly reduced
MRI activity as compared to treatment with mitoxan-
trone.21 In the Italian experience, only 2 of 24 partic-
ipants with MRI assessments at 1–2 years post-HCT
had new gadolinium-enhancing lesions.19 At North-
western University, there was a significant reduction
in new gadolinium-enhancing lesions and T2 lesion
volume after transplant.17 Of note, participants with
active inflammation on MRI at baseline had a lower
risk of progression after HDIT/HCT, as compared to
those without inflammation.16,19,31
In the HALT-MS study, participants had stabili-
zation of brain volume at 3 years through study con-
clusion at 5 years, consistent with attenuation of brain
tissue loss following resolution of brain inflammation.
A significant decrease in brain volume early after
HDIT/HCT was noted in earlier studies, raising con-
cern for brain atrophy, possibly due to high-dose che-
motherapy.32,33 However, in 3 other contemporary
studies, at time points beyond 2 years the rate of brain
volume loss was observed to decrease, approaching
normal for age.18,34,35
The MSIS was used in the HALT-MS study to
measure function and QoL, and showed improve-
ment during the first 3 years after transplant, with
a trend towards improvement that did not maintain
significance at 5 years. At Northwestern University,
using the Short Form–36, a similar analysis demon-
strated improvement at 4 years but not at 5 years,17
with the smaller number of participants available at 5
years possibly resulting in a loss of significance.
Investigation of the immunologic status of partic-
ipants in the HALT-MS study with sustained remis-
sion at 5 years post-HCT vs those with disease
activity may contribute to understanding mechanisms
of disease in MS. We have shown that dominant
CD41 T-cell clones present pre-HCT were unde-
tectable at 1 year post-HCT, whereas dominant
CD81 clones were not removed.3 Furthermore, par-
ticipants who failed to respond to treatment had less
diversity in their T-cell repertoire.3 Additional studies
are currently underway.
Accumulating evidence supports preemptive treat-
ment to prevent MS disease activity, to achieve best
long-term outcomes.9,36,37 For patients failing first-
line treatments, significantly more potent options are
becoming available.6,37 We suggest that HDIT/HCT
may be a reasonable consideration for such patients.
Prospective clinical trials comparing HDIT/HCT to
other approaches are needed.38 HDIT/HCT may rep-
resent a potential therapeutic option for patients with
RRMS who fail conventional immunotherapy.
