Abstract: Cnidarian envenomations are an important public health problem, responsible for more
deaths than shark attacks annually.
For this reason, optimization of first-aid care is essential.
According to the published literature, cnidarian venoms and toxins are heat labile at temperatures safe
for human application, which supports the use of hot-water immersion of the sting area(s). However,
ice packs are often recommended and used by emergency personnel. After conducting a systematic
review of the evidence for the use of heat or ice in the treatment of cnidarian envenomations, we
conclude that the majority of studies to date support the use of hot-water immersion for pain relief
and improved health outcomes.

1. Introduction
According to some estimates, more than 150 million cnidarian envenomations occur worldwide
every year [1].
Adverse reactions range from minor local pain to severe and life-threatening
cardiovascular collapse, and can vary depending on the age and health status of the victim, the amount
of tentacle contact, and the species involved in the envenomation. However, despite the frequency of
cnidarian envenomations and the medical urgency, there is much debate and disagreement between
national and international guidelines as to the most effective first-aid measures to reduce pain or
pathology from cnidarian stings. Conflicting recommendations confuse medical professionals and the
general public and undermine the ability of on-site first responders to provide the best care.
Immersion in hot water (~45 ˝C) is a well documented and commonly recommended therapy for
many kinds of marine envenomations, including the painful stings from echinoderms and venomous
fish [2]. The mechanism of action is not entirely clear, but there is evidence that marine venoms are
heat labile, and thus immersion of the sting area in hot water is thought to inactivate key venom
components. Others have postulated that the temperatures needed for such inactivation are much
higher (~60 ˝C), and thus suggest that the pain relief which occurs during hot-water immersion instead
results from physiological reactions to heat application (such as increased subcutaneous blood flow).
Conversely, it was once thought that cryotherapy or immersing envenomed areas in ice water
might slow the movement of venom towards the core (heart), and thus might lead to better outcomes in
deadly envenomations. Experimental evidence does not support the use of cryotherapy or cold-water
immersion in reducing pathology or improving clinical outcomes, however, and the practice is
no longer recommended [3]. Ice packs are still commonly used in non-life-threatening arthropod

envenomations, such as bee stings. In such cases, there is no presumed action on the venom, and
rather, relief is believed to occur through the anti-inflammatory effects of cold.
Hot water and ice are both inexpensive and readily available in many locations where cnidarian
stings might occur, and thus would make ideal sting treatments if effective. Thus, the purpose of this
review is to examine the evidence for the application of either cold (ice) or heat (hot-water immersion
or hot showers) in the treatment of cnidarian envenomations. We performed a systematic review of
published research to date (as of 25 January, 2016) by searching the following electronic databases:
MEDLINE, CINAHL, Cochrane Reviews, and Google Scholar. Search terms were: jellyfish or cubozoan
or cnidaria or physalia or ”Portuguese man-o-war” or “sea nettle” and sting or envenomation or pain
or treatment or heat or “hot-water immersion” or ice. We also examined reference lists from studies
and guidelines discovered in our searches for potentially relevant papers missed in our database
searches. More than 2000 articles were found via these searches, which were carefully examined and
narrowed to the 19 relevant publications and abstracts discussed in Levels I to IV in this paper (not
including published abstracts or the additional six case series without heat or cold application which
are also discussed in Level III).

The Levels of Evidence used in this review were adapted from the US Agency for Health Care
Policy and Research Classification, similar to that reported elsewhere [2,4]. They are as follows:

II
Evidence from non-randomized controlled trials
a
Quasi-randomized controlled trials

2. Level I Evidence: Randomized Controlled/Paired Trials
Three studies were determined to fit the criteria for Level I evidence. However, it is important
to highlight the difficulty of obtaining a high-quality randomized trial for the treatment of cnidarian
envenomations, particularly when temperature is one of the test conditions. How much tentacle
contact/venom delivery occurred, the duration of time between the sting event and when medical
care is sought (and thus when the victim is enrolled into the trial), and what measures are performed
during that time period (e.g., if the victim rinses the sting site in fresh water, or applies their own
remedies prior to approaching a life guard) are all variables that may have a significant impact on
clinical outcomes after a sting event and are difficult or impossible to control. Furthermore, there is
no adequate way to blind the study participants or administrators when the different treatments are
temperature based. That said, summaries of three trials are presented in Table 1.

Two of the Level I studies examined stings from the pan-tropical cubozoan Alatina alata
(synonymous with A. moseri, reported as Carybdea alata). Responses to stings from this large box
jellyfish can range from mild to severe, including life-threatening Irukandji syndrome. Thomas et al. [5]
evaluated the short-term effects of hot or cold pack application as compared to a placebo (less than
15 min post treatment) in 133 swimmers. All participants received vinegar dousing prior to hot or
cold pack application. Hot pack application reduced pain scores at 5 and 10 min post treatment,
and there was a significantly higher odds ratio (5.2) for the complete cessation of pain with hot pack
application compared with placebo. Hot pack application also reduced pain scores when compared
directly with cold pack application at 10 min. However, the authors themselves noted that the
effect only bordered on clinical significance. In a randomized paired trial on 25 healthy volunteers,
Nomura et al. [6] compared hot-water immersion with other common first-aid measures (papain and
vinegar). Volunteers were stung on each arm, and one was submerged in hot water and the other
received either vinegar or papain. Pain scores were lower with hot-water immersion at 4 and 20 min.
However, the use of potential active substances rather than a placebo may have affected the control
baseline, and the distraction of two simultaneous stings has been noted as a potential confounding
factor [2,3].
The third Level I study was a randomized controlled trial to test the efficacy of hot-water
immersion with ice packs for pain relief from Physalia stings (class Hydrozoa). Loten et al. [7] compared
the pain reported from 96 sting victims which were randomized to receive either hot-water immersion
(49 subjects) or ice packs (47 subjects). A significantly larger percentage of the hot-water group reported
less pain at 10 and 20 min of treatment (53% and 87%, respectively). At the halfway interim analysis, the
trial was halted as hot-water immersion was determined to be more effective (p = 0.002). The hot-water
group did begin the study with a higher degree of initial pain reported, though, which may indicate
allocation bias. In addition, only severe stings were admitted into the study, which may also have
influenced the results.
A fourth trial which would have been included as Level I evidence was reported in an abstract
in Emergency Medicine in 2002 [8], comparing hot showers to ice packs in Physalia envenomations
off the coast of Sydney, Australia in a randomized crossover trial. The abstract stated that 54 adults
were randomized to receive hot showers or cold pack application (27 each), while only 24 completed
crossover. Hot showers reduced total treatment time (11.0 min versus 14.5 min) and led to greater
percentage pain reduction (82.1% versus 65.6%) according to the combined results, with 48% of
hot-shower patients reporting complete pain cessation (while only 29% reported cessation with ice
packs). However, this study lacked follow up, and to our knowledge, complete methods and results
were never published in a full, peer-reviewed paper, thus they are not included in Table 1.
3. Level II Evidence: Non-Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials
No Level II evidence for the use of hot-water immersion or ice packs for cnidarian envenomations
was found. One study, which would have been included as Level II evidence, was reported in an
abstract in the Journal of Toxicology Clinical Toxicology in 2000 [9] and compared the use of ice or
hot-water immersion in a quasi-randomized trial. Adherent tentacles removed with vinegar; on odd
days, sting area was immersed in hot water (110 ˝F/ 43 ˝C), while on even days, ice packs were
applied. Follow up calls at 1, 4, and 24 h. Twenty-four patients completed the trial without protocol
violations; 16/16 hot water and 5/8 ice reported pain relief within 60 min. Three patients failed to
obtain pain relief with ice packs and subsequently experienced pain relief with immersion in hot water.
Hot water was reported as significantly better than ice at relieving pain (p < 0.05). However, this study
was never published as a full, peer-reviewed paper, thus it is not included as Level II evidence.
4. Level III Evidence: Retrospective Case Series
Three retrospective case series were identified where heat application or ice packs were used.
The results of these studies are summarized in Table 2.
Peca et al. [10] examined 40 cases of
 Toxins 2016, 8, 97
5 of 21
Carybdea marsupialis envenomation in individuals admitted to the Accident and Emergency Department
of San Giorgio Hospital in Cervia, Italy, in July and August, 1994. No systemic symptomology was
found in any of the patients, but all had linear erythematous weals ranging in length from a few
centimeters up to 20 centimeters. In eight patients, the sting area was soaked in “warm salty water
to deactivate the toxins, which are thermolabile, until resolution of symptoms was obtained, a result
achieved in all patients in about 30 min”. No statistical analyses were performed, and the temperature
of the water was not noted.
Yoshimoto and Yanagihara [11] examined the outcomes of 177 definite or probable cnidarian
stings over a five-year period in Hawai’i (1994–1998). Of the 177, 60 were treated with heat in some
form (53 with hot showers, seven with localized hot packs), but only 42% of cases contained sufficent
outcome information to be analyzed. Heat was found to be superior to parenteral analgesics (odds ratio
of 11.5, p = 0.08), particularly if analyses were restricted to hot showers (odds ratio of 22.0, p = 0.0485).
Of the 25 cases treated with heat and in whom outcome information was available, 23 reported relief
of pain. When only patients presenting with symtoms of Irukandji syndrome were considered, heat
still appeared to be superior to analgesics and benzodiazepines. Heat application was not reported to
be deleterious in any of the 60 cases.
Currie et al. [12] examined patients presenting with jellyfish stings at the Royal Darwin Hospital
and remote coastal community health clinics in the Northern Territory between 1 April 1991 and
30 May 2004. Ice was applied in 71% of cases, with additional analgesia required almost half (48%)
of the time, and parenteral narcotics necessary in almost a third (30%) of cases where ice was used.
No statistical analyses were conducted to determine if the application of ice affected clinical outcomes.
In addition, there are six additional case series of cnidarian envenomations, in which neither heat
nor ice was applied. Mareti´
c and Russell [13] discussed the outcomes of 55 cases of Anemonia sulcata
envenomations from the Adriatic Sea, noting that, for many of the cases, no immediate treatment was
given or the treatment was ineffective; vinegar, wine, urine, manure, mustard, ammonia, alcohol, and
petrol as common local measures, though the most commonly employed measure was “rubbing a fig
over the injured area”. No life-threatening cases were reported.
Labadie et al. [14] reported the results of 1079 Physalia physalis stings in patients, who reported
to a local poison center in Bordeaux, France from 2008 to 2011. Systemic symptoms were reported
in 20% of cases, including gastrointestinal, cardio-respiratory and neurological symptoms. In 2011,
8% of patients presented with severe enough systemic manifestations (such as respiratory distress)
to be considered life-threatening by the attending physician, though no fatal cases were reported.
The authors noted that hot-water immersion was not proposed as the evidence for its efficacy was for
a different species (Physalia utriculus), and the authorities deemed hot-water immersion “too difficult
to perform in case of collective accident with numerous patients to manage at the same time”.
Four of the additional case series examined patients presenting with Irukandji syndrome; none of
cases received ice packs or heat treatments for either the initial sting pathology or systemic symptoms.
Little and Mulcahy [15] identified 62 cases of Irukandji syndrome from Cairns emergency departments
in 1996. Of these, 61% received opiate analgesia, and 81% had vinegar applied, which appeared to
have no adverse effect. Huynh et al. [16] noted that, of 128 patients who were discharged with a
diagnosis of “marine stings” from Cairns Base Hospital in Queensland, Australalia, between June 2001
and July 2002, 116 had Irukandji syndrome symptoms. These cases required an average dose of 31
mg of morphine; 36% were discharged directly from the emergency department within eight hours of
presentation and 47% were discharged from the emergency department observation ward the next day.
Macrokanis et al. [17] found that, of 111 patients with marine stings between January 2001 and July 2003,
88 had symptoms of Irukandji syndrome; 38% of those had vinegar applied before admission to the
hospital; 50% were hypertensive upon arrival; and 90% required opiate analgesia. Nickson et al. [18]
described the outcomes of 87 Irukandji cases from Australia’s Northern Territory between 1990 and
2007. Systemic features were common, including hypertension and electrocardiographic abnormalities,
but no fatalities occurred. Vinegar was used in the majority of cases.

5. Level IV Evidence: Controlled Bench Studies, Expert Opinions/Letters, and
Systematic Reviews
Thirteen studies were determined to fit the criteria for Level IV evidence: 1 controlled bench study,
three systematic reviews, two uncontrolled studies, and seven expert opinions, which are summarized
in Table 3.
5.1. Controlled Bench Studies
Yanagihara et al. [19] developed a novel array of ex vivo cnidarian envenomations models with
which to test various first-aid measures. In the most sophisticated human tissue model, red blood cells
were suspended in an optically clear, low-melting point agarose protected by a skin substitute made
from sterilized porcine small intestine. Live tentacles were applied to the skin and allowed to sting
spontaneously for 5 min, at which point they were removed and a pack containing either ice water
or hot water (45 ˝C) was applied for 5 min. Size of the lytic zone was calculated after one hour of
incubation at 37 ˝C and compared to controls which received neither treatment. Hot-water treatment
significantly reduced the size of the lytic zone (p < 0.05), while ice water had no significant effect.
5.2. Systematic Reviews
Three systematic reviews were identified in our search. The first examined evidence for or against
hot-water immersion for all marine envenomations [2], finding that “Current published evidence
seems to support the use of hot-water immersion in the treatment of non-life threatening marine
envenomation, alongside other established first aid measures.” Similarly, a systematic review six years
later also concluded that the experimental evidence supports the use of heat to inactivate venom
components [4], and a similar systematic review for the Cochrane Database found limited support for
the use of hot-water immersion and no support for the use of ice to treat cnidarian envenomations [20].
5.3. Uncontrolled Trials and Expert Opinions/Letters
Exton et al. [21] provided the first evidence in support of the use of ice in an uncontrolled
trial. Physalia stings were classified by severity (severe, moderate or mild) and pain severety (severe,
moderate or mild) for 143 sting victims at the beach. For all cases, ice packs were applied for 5–10 min,
after which pain was assessed. If pain persisted, an ice pack was applied for an additional 5–10 min,
then pain was reassessed. All of the mild pain cases resolved after one ice pack application, while
about a quarter of the moderate and over a third of the severe cases required additional treatment.
Pain persisted after two ice packs in 25% of the severe cases and 2% of the moderate ones. While ice
was credited with symptom relief, there was no placebo or control performed. Thus, it is unclear how
many cases would have resolved spontaneously without ice.
Taylor [22] performed a quick experiment using a local Carybdea species at a doctor’s seminar
at the Busselton Hospital in Western Australia, which was published as a letter to the editor. Five
volunteers (doctors and medical students) were stung by dragging tentacles over the forearm, two
stings per arm for a total of four stings. Each volunteer then received four treatments, one at each
sting site: ice, vinegar, aluminium sulfate, and hot water (approximately 45 ˝C). Hot water led to 85%
pain relief during treatment and 88% continuing pain relief after treatment, while ice relieved pain
in 25% of cases during treatment and relief was continued in only 2% of cases after treatment. The
simultaneous testing of four treatments may have made pain judgements difficult, however, and no
statistics were performed.

later, a weak ammonia solution, neither of which seemed to
relieve pain; pain spontaneously resolved about 20 min
after sting. About 1 hr later, returning to the water
led to immediate pain similar to initial sting.
Pain was also “reawakened” 4.5 h
after the sting by rubbing the area
with ice, producing an “electric feeling,”
while warm water had no effects.

is increasing evidence that hot-water
immersion is more effective in reducing the
pain of jellyfish stings. It is time that bodies,
such as the ARC, recommend the first aid
treatment supported by the evidence.”

Several experts have described personal successes with ice or heat, or warned of potential
complications. The earliest examples found of cold water or ice as a potential treatment contraindicated
their use, particularly for Physalia. Bennett [23] found cold-water application increased the symptoms
of his own Physalia sting in 1834, while Barnes [24] noted that in the case of one sting, ice “re-awakened”
pain symptoms when applied more than four hours after the sting, while warm water had no effects.
Burnett [25] appears to be the first to recommend against the use of heat, citing a single example
where visible erythematous lymphangitic spread on the extremity of an adult male who had immersed
his arm in a 31 ˝C water bath for 13 min following a Physalia sting. Burnett thus concluded that “the
use of local heat is contraindicated since it increases the permeability of the venom”. However, the
temperature of the water used was well below body temperature and thus was not “hot water”, nor
was it in the known range of venom inactivation (somewhere between 40–60 ˝C, Table 4). Burnett
also noted that cold compresses were not effective, as any pain reduction which occurs while the
compress is applied “returns once the extremity is rewarmed”. He later softened his position on
both [30], writing that “additional pain relief can be achieved by cold packs or warm compresses,”
with the caveats that “care must be taken not to over-chill a small patient nor to apply sufficient
heat that vasodilatation opens extra avenues for venom entry to the core of the body”. However,
fears of negative outcomes from vasodilation due to heat have not been corroborated by the clinical
literature (see evidence in Levels I–III; Tables 1–3). Other opinions supportive of ice packs for pain cite
unpublished data [26] or opinions of others who cite unpubished data [28], showing how conclusions
lacking scientific support are propagate through the literature.
Taylor [27] reported on four stings from the cubozoan Tamoya gigantua, two of which were his
own. For the first three cases, no treatment steps are described. In the last case, the author was stung
extensively on the hand and head while snorkeling, and thought to test the efficacy of hot-water
immersion by soaking his hand and head in water “as hot as he could stand”. Hot water instantly
relieved pain, but reliefwas transient if the area was removed before 20 min of treatment. Hot towels
and a hot shower were not effective.
More recently, Little [29] reviewed many of the studies included in the first three levels of evidence
in this paper, and concluded that “there is very little evidence to support the use of ice packs for jellyfish
stings, and there is increasing evidence that hot-water immersion is more effective in reducing the pain
of jellyfish stings” He also had strong words for the Australian Resucitation Council (ARC) and others
who write clinical guidelines, stating that, “It is time that bodies, such as the ARC, recommend the
first-aid treatment supported by the evidence”.

6. Mechanism of Action of Heat/Hot-Water Immersion
The prevailing hypothesis as to the mechanism by which heat treats cnidarian envenomations is
that the temperatures used inactivate venom components. There is abundant evidence from in vitro
and in vivo studies which suggest that cndarian venoms from all classes in the phylum are heat labile
(Table 4) [31–45]. Some have suggested that the mechanism by which heat provides pain relief is
unrelated to inactivation of venom components. The alternative explanation proposed is that hot-water
immersion has a direct modulatory effect on pain receptors leading to a reduction in perceived
pain [46].
7. Hot-Water Immersion for Other Envenomations
Hot-water immersion is considered the standard of care for most marine and freshwater
envenomations (Table 5) [47–73]. It is the primary recommendation for stings from echinoderms
(incluing sea stars, sea urchins, and sea cucumbers) [47–50,52–55,57,59,60], as well marine and
freshwater fishes (including sting rays, scorpionfishes, weeverfishes and catfishes) [47–57,61–73].
Hot water has also been recommended for stings from polychete worms [58]. These injuries are
generally considered mild to moderate, and not life-threatening. However, hot-water immersion
has been recommended for the potentially lethal stings from stonefishes [47–57,71–73] and, on some
occasions, cone snails [47,50]. The only marine envenomations where hot-water immersion has not
been recommended are bites from sea snakes, which should be treated in the same manner as other
neurotoxic snake envenomations, including antivenom administration.
For terrestrial envenomations, hot-water immersion was less commonly recommended
(Table 5) [74–78], although there has been some support for the use of targeted, localized heat in the
treatment of insect bites and stings [79]. Heat therapy is specifically contraindicated for recluse spider
envenomations (Loxoceles spp.), as the dermonecrotic venom factor sphingomyelinase D increases its
activity as temperature increases [75]. This group of spiders are the only ones with this particular
enzyme, however, so it is unclear if hot-water immersion would be appropriate in other spider
envenomations. Preliminary case reports and investigations suggest heat application may aid in pain
relief from scorpion stings [76,77] and centipede bites [78]. A prospective cohort study (N = 146) from
Germany found that the targeted application of heat (maximum of 51 ˝C) for 3–6 s using the Bite
Away® device (RIEMSER Pharma GmbH, Greifswald, Germany) led to a reduction visual analog scale
scores for pain, swelling and pruritus from mosquito bites and bee and wasp stings [79]. Neither
heat application nor ice are recommended for snakebites [80], though we could find no clinical
documentation of the use of hot-water immersion. Cohen et al. [81] found that, in a mouse model,
hot-water immersion caused increased mortality in one of the two experiements performed with
the hemotoxic venom of Agkistrodon piscivorus, contraindicating the use of hot-water immersion for
snakebites. Interestingly, they also noted using heat application in their own clinical pathway for
snakebite; however, they stated that heat is only applied after antivenom has been administered and
provided no information about the clinical efficacy of heat application.

8. Conclusions
The preponderance of evidence demonstrates that hot-water immersion is a safe and effective
method of reducing pain from cnidarian envenomations, and is also associated with improved clinical
outcomes. No studies or cases were found where hot-water immersion led to worsened symptoms
or poorer clinical outcomes. Fears of negative effects of immersing a stung limb in 45 ˝C water for
20 min are not supported in the literature; this is not surprising, given that hot-water immersion is
considered safe and is recommended for the treatment of stonefish stings and other life-threatening
marine envenomations with potential cardiovascular complications.
There are two noted caveats to the use of hot-water immersion in the case of envenomations:
temperature safety and temperature maintenance. While there is considerable concern regarding
thermal injuries from hot-water immersion, there was only a single recorded case of significant
thermal burn from over 200 cases of the use of hot-water immersion reviewed by Atkinson et al. [2].
Similarly, the difficulty of maintaining hot-water at an appropriate temperature on site can be overcome
using several methods, including the use of reusable hot packs instead of water, continual hot-water
input (such as from a shower or hose at the correct temperature), or an immersion container with
better insulatory capabilities. To that end, Lau et al. [54] tested the use of different containers on
temperature maintenance, finding that thermal insulators (standard coolers) were able to maintain
water temperature effectively for a full 30 min.
