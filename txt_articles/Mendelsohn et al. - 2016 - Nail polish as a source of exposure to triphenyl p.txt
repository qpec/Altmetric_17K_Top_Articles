Abstract
Triphenyl phosphate (TPHP) is primarily used as either a flame retardant or plasticizer, and is 
listed as an ingredient in nail polishes. However, the concentration of TPHP in nail polish and the 
extent of human exposure following applications have not been previously studied. We measured 
TPHP in ten different nail polish samples purchased from department stores and pharmacies in 
2013–2014. Concentrations up to 1.68% TPHP by weight were detected in eight samples, 
including two that did not list TPHP as an ingredient. Two cohorts (n=26 participants) were 
recruited to assess fingernail painting as a pathway of TPHP exposure. Participants provided urine 
samples before and after applying one brand of polish containing 0.97% TPHP by weight. 
Diphenyl phosphate (DPHP), a TPHP metabolite, was then measured in urine samples (n=411) 
and found to increase nearly seven-fold 10–14 hours after fingernail painting (p<0.001). To 
determine relative contributions of inhalation and dermal exposure, ten participants also painted 
their nails and painted synthetic nails adhered to gloves on two separate occasions, and collected 
urine for 24 hours following applications. Urinary DPHP was significantly diminished when 
wearing gloves, suggesting that the primary exposure route is dermal. Our results indicate that nail 
polish may be a significant source of short-term TPHP exposure and a source of chronic exposure 
for frequent users or those occupationally exposed.
INTRODUCTION
Chemical additives are often incorporated into plastics and resins to alter the properties of 
the material or to protect from weathering or fire. For example, organophosphorus (OP) 
compounds are commonly added to polyurethane foam in furniture and baby products to 
purportedly slow the spread of fire.1, 2 In addition to being used as flame retardants, OP 
compounds are used in a variety of other applications. Triphenyl phosphate (TPHP), an aryl

 phosphate, is used both as a flame retardant in polyurethane foam and as a plasticizer in 
hydraulic fluids, lacquers, and varnishes.3, 4
Data on the toxicity of TPHP in humans is scarce; however, an emerging toxicological 
literature indicates that exposure is associated with endocrine impacts, reproductive and 
developmental toxicity, and genotoxicity.5–11 Short-term (21 day) exposure to TPHP in 
zebra fish, for example, has been associated with altered sex hormone balance and 
disruptions of reproductive performance.5 Additionally, TPHP exposure has been associated 
with peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma agonism, which may impact 
metabolic function and weight gain.10, 11 Although limited to two studies, data in humans 
also suggest that TPHP alters endocrine function and impacts reproduction; altered thyroid 
hormone levels and decreased semen quality were both observed with increasing TPHP 
exposure.12, 13
Much of the general population is likely exposed to TPHP. Once absorbed, TPHP is rapidly 
metabolized to diphenyl phosphate (DPHP) and several other metabolites, and excreted in 
urine (Figure 1).14, 15 In our previous work we found detectable levels of DPHP, in greater 
than 90 percent of a convenience sample of adults living in North Carolina in the United 
States [n=53];16 several other studies from within and outside the U.S. have also reported 
near ubiquitous detection of DPHP.17–23 We also reported that DPHP levels were 
approximately twice as high in women compared to men, which may suggest differences in 
exposure patterns by sex.16 Similar patterns have been observed for some phthalate 
metabolites (e.g. monobenzyl phthalate and monoethyl phthalate), a finding which has been 
attributed in part to differences in the use of personal care products between males and 
females.24 TPHP is commonly listed as an ingredient in nail polishes; according to the 
Environmental Working Group’s Skin Deep® cosmetic database, TPHP is on the label of 
about half of polishes available for sale between 2012 and 2015,25 likely added to increase 
flexibility and durability.26 Recent media focus on working conditions faced by nail salon 
employees has drawn attention to occupational exposures to potentially hazardous chemicals 
in nail polish (e.g. toluene, formaldehyde, and dibutyl phthalate).27 However, human 
exposure to TPHP in nail polish and the potential resulting occupational and consumer 
health risks have not yet been characterized.
The purpose of this study was to evaluate nail polish applications as a potential pathway of 
exposure to TPHP. We investigated the levels of TPHP in ten different nail polish samples 
and assessed urinary DPHP levels in two cohorts of study participants. In the first cohort 
(n=16), urine samples were collected before and after application of one TPHP-containing 
polish. In the second cohort (n=10), background exposures and the total estimated amount of 
TPHP absorbed via inhalation and dermal routes were assessed to better characterize the 
primary exposure pathway. This work provides useful information for understanding 
pathways of exposure to TPHP among the general population and for characterizing risks 
from TPHP use in nail polish.

 MATERIALS AND METHODS
Characterization of Nail Polish TPHP
Nail polish samples were purchased in Durham and Wake counties in North Carolina from 
common department stores and pharmacies. This study was designed to measure the amount 
of TPHP in selected polishes, not as a random sample of nail polish. Therefore, product 
labels were assessed in order to purchase polishes that listed TPHP as an ingredient (n=7), as 
well as polishes that did not include TPHP as an ingredient (n=3). Three replicates bottles of 
three different polishes were also purchased to assess variability between replicate bottles. 
These bottles were purchased at different stores and over the course of several months.
To measure TPHP, a drop of each brand of nail polish was weighed, dissolved with acetone, 
and then diluted to 100 mL with dichloromethane (DCM). A 1 mL aliquot of this diluted 
solution was transferred to a glass amber autosampler vial, spiked with deuterated TPHP 
(d15TPHP), and analyzed using GC/MS using established methods.28 The mass of a 100 µL 
aliquot of each nail polish was recorded to calculate the TPHP density. Triplicate sub-
analyses were conducted for seven different polishes to assess homogeneity within each 
bottle.
Study Participants (Cohorts 1 and 2)
Cohort 1 consisted of 16 female Duke University (Durham, North Carolina) undergraduate 
students recruited in the spring of 2014. Cohort 2 comprised ten female Duke University 
graduate students and employees recruited in the spring of 2015. The Duke University 
Institutional Review Board approved study protocols and participants gave informed 
consent. Participants were each provided with a new bottle of clear nail polish and a urine 
collection kit with instructions for collecting urine. All participants were given the same nail 
polish, a brand and type that was part of the nail polish TPHP assessment (see above) and 
contained 0.97% TPHP by weight. Although individual bottles provided to participants were 
not analyzed for TPHP, results of the nail polish TPHP assessment indicated that there was 
minimal variability in TPHP content among bottles of the same brand and type (see below). 
Participants from cohorts 1 and 2 also provided demographic information and completed a 
questionnaire about potential modifiers of exposure, including nail biting and the frequency 
of hand washing. Although our questionnaire included several categories for frequency of 
hand washing, we dichotomized the categories based on the median response. Similarly, nail 
biting was dichotomized as either none or any biting.
Cohort 1: Urine Collection
Participants were asked to remove existing nail polish from fingernails and toenails and then 
wait 72 hours before beginning the study. Participants then collected urine samples (~50 
mL) at three time points (Figure 2). An initial urine sample was collected at a time of the 
participant’s choosing (T1). Approximately 24 hours later, participants painted their 
fingernails with two coats of the provided polish. Spot urine samples were then collected 
approximately 2–6 hours after nail polish application (T2) and 10–14 hours after application 
(T3). All urine samples were collected in standard polypropylene specimen containers and 
frozen until analysis.

 Cohort 2: Urine Collection
As in cohort 1, participants were asked to remove nail polish from previous applications 72 
hours before beginning the study and to not apply nail polish throughout the study except for 
the purpose of the study. Urine collection took place over three phases (control, nail 
painting, and glove painting; Figure 2). During each phase, participants collected all urine 
over either 24 or 48 hours (four participants collected urine for 48 hours) using a separate 
container for each void. Participants were asked to collect the entire volume of each void 
using 500mL polypropylene specimen containers and immediately freeze the sample. 
Participants first completed the control phase, in which they did not apply nail polish and 
collected all urine for 24 hours. During the nail painting phase, participants collected urine 
upon waking in the morning, and then proceeded to paint their fingernails with two coats of 
the provided nail polish and collect all urine for the following 24 or 48 hours. Nail polish 
was removed upon completion of urine collection. The glove painting phase mirrored the 
nail painting phase, but participants wore latex gloves and applied polish to synthetic nails 
attached to gloves. Participants were asked to keep the gloves on or near their hands for one 
hour post nail polish application to allow polish to completely dry before discarding the 
gloves. Both the synthetic nails and adhesive were tested for TPHP and were found to be 
below the method limit of detection (results not shown). Half the participants completed the 
nail painting phase before the glove painting phase, and half completed the glove painting 
phase before the nail painting phase. Participants waited a minimum of seven days between 
these two phases to ensure complete urinary excretion of DPHP from the previous phase.
Urine Processing
Extraction and measurement of DPHP in urine was performed as previously described.19, 29 
Briefly, DPHP was measured using mixed-mode anion exchange solid phase extraction and 
a mass-labeled internal standard (d10-DPHP) with analysis by negative electrospray 
ionization liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry.29 d10-DPHP was used as an 
internal standard and spiked into all urine and lab blank samples prior to extraction. 13C-
DPHP was spiked immediately prior to analysis to quantify d10-DPHP recovery. Average 
recovery for d10-DPHP was 115±22%. DPHP levels were also evaluated in laboratory 
blanks (n=5; purified water) for quality assurance purposes and were very low (mean = 
0.11±0.07 ng). Therefore, the method detection limit (MDL) was calculated using three 
times the standard deviation of the blanks normalized to the urine volume extracted (MDL = 
0.10 ng/mL). The total volume of each urine sample was measured for Cohort 2.
To account for urine dilution, specific gravity (SG) was also measured in each urine sample 
prior to analysis using a digital handheld refractometer (Atago, Bellevue, WA, USA). The 
average SG among samples was 1.013. Presented concentration data and results are based on 
SG corrected DPHP measurements;30 however, analyses with uncorrected measurements 
produced very similar results (results not shown).
Statistical Analyses
All statistical analyses were performed in the R Package 2.12.02 (Vienna, Austria). 
Descriptive statistics were calculated for TPHP in nail polish samples and for urinary DPHP

 concentrations. Values below the method detection limit (MDL) were replaced with MDL 
divided by the square root of 2.
Preliminary analyses indicated that urinary DPHP concentrations were log-normally 
distributed and therefore data were log10 transformed for further analyses. To evaluate the 
relationship between nail painting and urinary SG-corrected DPHP concentrations over time, 
we used a linear mixed effects regression model, which accommodates correlation in the 
data caused by multiple measurements per participant.31, 32 To aid in the interpretation of 
results, we exponentiated beta coefficients (10β) for each time point. Exponentiated beta 
coefficients represent the multiplicative change in DPHP levels compared to the pre-
application sample. Urinary DPHP concentration data were combined from cohort 1 and 
cohort 2 (nail painting phase only) to match the time points of cohort 1 (T1 = pre-
application; T2 = 2–6 hours post application; T3 =10–14 hours post application). Urinary 
DPHP concentrations for each individual over time were also plotted to visually examine 
trends and deviations from patterns observed for the cohorts as a whole.
To determine whether personal behavior modified exposure to TPHP via nail polish, we 
evaluated associations between nail biting and hand-washing frequency, and the change in 
urinary DPHP concentrations from T1 to T3, i.e. the change in DPHP between the pre-
application and 10–14 hour post-application samples. Beta coefficients (10β) were 
exponentiated for each predictor, producing the multiplicative impact of each factor.
Using only data from cohort 2, we compared the total mass of DPHP excreted in each phase 
using a linear mixed effect model (accounting for residual correlation within individuals). 
We calculated the total mass of DPHP excreted per individual, i.e. multiplied the DPHP 
concentration (ng/mL) and sample volume (mL) from each void and then summed the 
DPHP mass to estimate total DPHP mass excreted over 24 and 48 hours (depending on 
individual) for each participant in each phase (control phase, nail painting phase, and glove 
painting phase). As with concentration values, DPHP mass data were log-normally 
distributed and were log10 transformed for analysis.
We estimated total TPHP mass in a nail polish application using the measured concentration 
of TPHP by weight in the nail polish provided to participants and assuming the average 
mass of nail polish applied to be 0.3 g, as previously estimated.33, 34 To estimate absorbed 
TPHP dose, we compared the estimated moles of TPHP in a nail polish application to moles 
of urinary DPHP excreted over 24 or 48 hours (depending on individual) in the nail painting 
phase, accounting for background levels by subtracting out the moles of DPHP excreted by 
each participant during the control phase (for individuals who provided 48 hour samples 
during the nail painting phase, we subtracted twice the individual’s 24 hour control phase 
DPHP).
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Nail Polish TPHP
The majority of the nail polish samples (8 of 10) contained measurable levels of TPHP; 
concentrations ranged from non-detectable (ND) to 16.8 mg/g (1.68% by sample weight)

 with a median of 8.9 mg/g TPHP (0.89% by weight; Table 1). Of the three polishes that did 
not list TPHP as an ingredient (despite listing other ingredients), two contained TPHP (0.49 
and 0.61% by sample weight). These findings suggest that consumers may not be able to 
reliably avoid polishes containing TPHP based on product labels. Levels of TPHP were very 
similar in bottles of polish for which duplicates were purchased, despite being purchased 
over the course of several months and at different stores. These data suggest that there is 
little variability in TPHP content between batches. Similarly, replicate measurements made 
from the same bottle were quite similar, indicating nail polish is a homogeneous mixture 
with respect to TPHP. Our data also suggest that the levels of TPHP may be higher in clear 
polishes than colored polishes (median clear 1.16% and median colored 0.49%). As clear 
nail polishes are often used as a base coat or top coat, some individuals may be 
simultaneously exposed to TPHP in both colored polish and clear polish. However, due to 
our small sample size we caution against the over interpretation of this finding.
We are unable to assess the average frequency of TPHP use in nail polishes because we 
specifically chose polishes that contain TPHP. According to the EWG’s Skin Deep® 
cosmetics database, TPHP is used in about half of nail polishes available for sale between 
2012–2015;25 however, our findings indicating TPHP is unlabeled in some polishes suggests 
that the percentage of polishes containing TPHP may be higher. Levels of TPHP observed in 
samples were similar to those previously reported for other ingredients of concern in nail 
polish (e.g. dibutyl phthalate, which has generally been detected at <5% by weight in nail 
polish35, 36).
Background Urinary DPHP Concentrations
A total of 101 urine samples were collected for measurements of background DPHP (control 
samples), of which 87 contained detectable levels of TPHP. From cohort 1, a pre-application 
sample was collected from each participant (n=16). From cohort 2, 65 background samples 
were collected during the control phase, and additional control samples were collected from 
each participant (n=10) at the start of the nail painting and glove phases. The geometric 
mean (GM) for all control samples (combining both cohorts) was 0.96 ng/mL (range = < 
MDL – 14.74 ng/mL) and was very similar to urinary DPHP concentrations reported in 
other U.S. cohorts.12, 16–19
Urinary DPHP Concentrations After Nail Polish Application
DPHP was detected in 24 out of 26 urine samples collected 2–6 hours following application 
of nail polish to fingernails (T2) (GM = 2.48 ng/mL; range = <MDL – 23.92 ng/mL; Figure 
3) and all samples had detectable levels of DPHP 10–14 hours post-nail polish application 
(T3) (GM = 13.02 ng/mL; range = 1.15 – 168.29 ng/mL). Compared to T1, DPHP levels 
were higher at T2, but not significantly so (10β=1.26; 95% CI: 0.75, 2.10; p=0.38). However, 
a significant increase was observed at T3, with urinary DPHP levels 6.59 times those 
collected at T1 (95% CI: 3.95, 11.00; p<0.0001). These results suggest that nail polish use is 
likely a significant source of short-term TPHP exposure. Neither nail biting nor hand 
washing frequency was associated with the magnitude of change in urinary DPHP 
concentrations from T1 to T3, indicating that nail biting and hand washing frequency may 
not significantly modify exposure levels associated with nail painting (results not shown).

 We cannot determine when DPHP concentrations peaked in cohort 1 because urine samples 
were collected at only two time points after polish application. In cohort 2, of the six 
participants who collected only 24 hours of urine samples following nail polish application 
to fingernails, two exhibited peaks within the time frame, while four exhibited maximum 
urinary DPHP in their final samples, suggesting that DPHP concentrations may have peaked 
after completion of urine collection for these individuals (Figure 4). Three of the four 
participants who collected 48 hours of urine samples exhibited peaks in urinary DPHP 
concentrations between 10 to 20 hours post nail polish application (Figure 5). The maximum 
urinary DPHP concentration of the fourth participant who provided 48 hours of samples 
occurred in their final sample. In the control and glove painting phases, urinary DPHP 
concentrations over 24 and 48 hours were lower and showed less variability compared to the 
nail painting phase for the majority of participants, although some aberrations were observed 
(Figures 4 and 5). Differences between individuals in rates of uptake, metabolism, excretion 
or residual confounding by other exposures to TPHP may have contributed to the variability 
observed in urinary DPHP concentrations over time. Unfortunately we did not collect 
information on personal characteristics that may be related to these factors such as race and 
ethnicity, body mass index or other environmental exposures (e.g. smoking and tobacco 
use).
Although our current work is focused on TPHP exposure, our urine extraction and analysis 
methods can also be used to measure biomarkers of exposure to other organophosphorus 
compounds, including tris (1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate (TDCIPP).29 We found no 
significant difference from T1 to T2, or T3 in the geometric mean concentrations of bis(1,3-
dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate (BDCIPP), a metabolite of the organophosphate TDCIPP, 
which is also detected frequently, and at similar levels, as DPHP metabolite.16–23 This result 
was expected as TDCIPP is not, to our knowledge, used as an ingredient in nail polish. 
Geometric mean concentration of BDCIPP at T1, T2, and T3 were 1.51 ng/mL, 1.56 ng/mL 
and 1.55 ng/mL, respectively.
Excreted Urinary DPHP Mass
The geometric mean urinary DPHP mass excreted over 24 hours in the control phase of 
cohort 2 was 1.2 µg (range = 0.5 – 8.3 µg; Figure 6). The urinary DPHP mass excreted over 
24 hours in the nail painting phase was 11.2 times that of the control phase (95% CI: 6.10, 
20.61; p<0.0001), with a geometric mean of 13.7 µg (range = 5.4 – 38.8 µg). Urinary DPHP 
mass excreted over 24 hours in the glove-painting phase did not significantly differ from the 
control phase (10β =1.43; 95% CI: 0.78, 2.64; p = 0.23), with a geometric mean of 1.8 µg 
(range = 0.6 – 6.0 µg). These results increase the evidence that nail polish is a source of 
exposure to TPHP, as confounding by other exposures was shown to be minimal during the 
control phase. In addition, because the painting of gloves prevented dermal exposure, these 
results indicate that dermal absorption is likely the primary route of exposure to TPHP from 
nail polish use. The small, not statistically significant increase when wearing gloves may 
suggest a small amount of inhalation exposure; further experimentation with greater 
experimental power would be needed to test this hypothesis. These results also suggest that 
people in close proximity to nail polish applications may not have significant exposure to 
TPHP. However, additional research is needed to understand exposure routes in nail salons,

 as it is possible that multiple concurrent manicures in an enclosed space may contribute to a 
non-negligible amount of TPHP inhalation.
We estimated that application of nail polish containing 0.97% TPHP by weight to 
fingernails is approximately 2.9 mg, or 8.9 × 10−6 mols, TPHP (molecular weight = 3.26 × 
105 mg/mol). To estimate the proportion of TPHP from a nail polish application that is 
absorbed and metabolized to DPHP by the user, we took the ratio of moles of urinary DPHP 
(molecular weight = 2.50 × 105 mg/mol) excreted by each participant during the nail phase 
(with the number of moles from each participant’s control phase subtracted to account for 
background DPHP) to the moles of TPHP we estimated to be in a nail polish application. 
Based on these calculations, we found a geometric mean of 0.5% TPHP absorbed and 
metabolized to DPHP over 24 hours following a nail polish application (range = 0.2 – 
1.7%). Over 48 hours, we also found a geometric mean of 0.5% TPHP absorbed and 
metabolized to DPHP (range = 0.1 – 2.2%), which suggests that the majority of TPHP 
applied may be absorbed, metabolized, and excreted during the first 24 hours following nail 
polish application. However, as there were only four participants who provided 48 hours of 
samples, we cannot conclusively determine the amount of time it takes for all absorbed 
TPHP to be metabolized to DPHP and excreted in urine. We also cannot rule out the 
possibility that dermal absorption of TPHP continues after 24 (48) hours of wearing nail 
polish, or that TPHP may partition to different compartments in the body (e.g. serum, 
lipids), where it may be stored beyond 24 (48) hours. In vitro work indicates that TPHP is 
metabolized to compounds other than DPHP (e.g. hydroxylated TPHP [OH-TPHP]).15 Our 
methods were not designed to measure other metabolites; however, a recent human study 
did not find OH-TPHP in urine samples, suggesting it may not be a relevant metabolite in 
vivo.20 Nonetheless, we cannot exclude the possibility that TPHP may be metabolized to 
other compounds, suggesting that our estimates of the percent of TPHP absorbed are likely 
underestimates.
From our current work, we cannot conclusively determine whether TPHP is absorbed 
through the nail plate or through the cuticles and surrounding skin. The nail plate, composed 
primarily of keratin, is generally characterized by low permeability to most molecules; 
however, nail polishes may contain other compounds that enhance absorption across the nail 
(e.g. solvents).37, 38 Tissues surrounding the nail also contain an extensive vascular network, 
which may readily facilitate chemical absorption through the skin.37 It is also possible that 
hand-to-mouth contact may result in incidental ingestion of TPHP following nail polish 
application, particularly for individuals biting their nails. Although we did not see 
associations between nail biting and DPHP levels, more refined measures of hand-to-mouth 
contacts may provide additional insights.
More research is needed to determine whether our reported levels of exposure to TPHP from 
nail polish use pose a risk to human health. TPHP and flame retardant mixtures containing 
TPHP (e.g. Firemaster® 550 [FM550]) have been associated with adverse outcomes in a 
growing number of experimental toxicology studies.5–11, 39 For example, in vitro TPHP 
exposure was found to divert mouse bone marrow cells away from osteogenesis toward 
adipogenesis, suggesting that TPHP may potentially affect bone health and weight gain.11 In 
vitro TPHP exposure has also been shown to impact estrogenic activity.40 In rats, perinatal

 exposure to FM550 has been associated with early puberty and obesity,39 which data 
suggest may be driven by TPHP (~10–20% of FM550 by weight).10, 11 In zebrafish, 
cardiotoxic effects including severe pericardial edema and blocked cardiac looping were 
induced by TPHP exposure during embryogenesis.41 Data in humans remain limited. 
Meeker et al., however, recently reported endocrine and reproductive impacts in adult men 
associated with levels of DPHP lower than those observed in our cohort prior to nail 
painting.18
Our results should be interpreted in the context of several strengths and limitations. In 
particular, cohort 2 collected the entire volume of each urine void over 24 or 48 hours. We 
designed the cohort 2 experiment using identical phases (control, nail painting, glove 
painting) to reduce confounding, for example by other exposures. In the glove-painting 
phase, we prevented dermal exposure, allowing us to determine the importance of this route 
of exposure. However, our sample size may have limited our ability to detect meaningful 
behavioral associations and to adjust for multiple covariates in regression analyses. 
Additionally, our sample was comprised of a highly homogeneous group of university 
students and employees. While this may limit the generalizability of our results to other 
populations, we do not anticipate that it would impact the validity of our results.
Despite these limitations, our data indicate that nail polish is a likely source of exposure to 
TPHP and that use may result in exposures substantially greater than background levels. As 
it has been estimated that adult women paint their nails approximately once per week on 
average, nail polish use may be a chronic source of exposure for many women.34, 42 
Additional data are needed to determine exposure routes for individuals who are 
occupationally exposed in nail salons and to understand inter-individual variability in the 
quantity and timing of DPHP excretion following TPHP exposure.

 HIGHLIGHTS
•
Some nail polishes contain the plasticizer triphenyl phosphate (TPHP)
•
Urinary metabolites of TPHP increased 7-fold following nail polish application
•
TPHP exposure from nail polish appears to occur via dermal exposure
•
TPHP may be a replacement for phthalates in nail polish
