Abstract
Background: Spontaneous vaginal birth rates are decreasing worldwide, while ce-
sarean delivery, instrumental births, and medical birth interventions are increasing. 
Emerging evidence suggests that birth interventions may have an effect on children’s 
health. Therefore, the aim of our study was to examine the association between op-
erative and medical birth interventions on the child’s health during the first 28 days 
and up to 5 years of age.
Methods: In New South Wales (Australia), population- 
linked data sets were ana-
lyzed, including data on maternal characteristics, child characteristics, mode of birth, 
interventions during labor and birth, and adverse health outcomes of the children (ie, 
jaundice, feeding problems, hypothermia, asthma, respiratory infections, gastrointes-
tinal disorders, other infections, metabolic disorder, and eczema) registered with the 
International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 
Tenth Revision, Australian Modification codes. Logistic regression analyses were 
performed for each adverse health outcome.
Results: Our analyses included 491 590 women and their children; of those 38% 
experienced a spontaneous vaginal birth. Infants who experienced an instrumental

INTRODUCTION
Worldwide cesarean delivery rates are increasing, while 
spontaneous vaginal birth rates are decreasing.1 The rate 
of cesarean delivery has risen steadily in Europe to 25%, in 
Australia to 33%, and the highest rates are reported in Latin 
America and the Caribbean (41%).1,2 Instrumental birth (ie, 
forceps or vacuum) and medical birth interventions (ie, in-
cluding the use of exogenous oxytocin for labor induction 
and/or augmentation) are increasing globally as well.3
There is emerging evidence that operative birth (ie, instru-
mental vaginal birth or cesarean) may have an effect on chil-
dren’s physical health and cognitive development in the longer 
term.4-7 The Extended Hygiene Hypothesis (EHH) hypothesizes 
that infants born by cesarean delivery have different coloniza-
tion of the gut flora compared with infants born by vaginal birth. 
This may potentially affect the neonatal immune response.8,9 
The EPIgenetic Impact of Childbirth (EPIIC) hypothesis raises 
concern over the effects of stress (too high and too low) caused 
by medical and operative birth interventions to the epigenetic 
regulation of gene expression in the immune system.10,11
Studies have demonstrated that children born vaginally 
at term have different short- 
 and longer-term physical health 
outcomes than those born by cesarean, particularly when 
there has been no exposure.4,6,7 Epidemiological studies that 
analyzed population- 
based registry data, reported conflicting 
associations between operative birth interventions, and the 
increased risk of several immune- 
related diseases, including 
asthma, type 1 diabetes, obesity, and inflammatory bowel 
disease.12-18 These conflicting findings may be due to differ-
ent statistical methods used, differences in study population 
characteristics (eg, maternal age, morbidity, smoking, and 
gestational age), and failure to differentiate between mode of 
birth and medical birth interventions.
The aim of this study was to examine the associations be-
tween operative and/or medical birth interventions on chil-
dren’s health outcomes in the first 28 days and up to 5 years 
of age, in a large population of healthy pregnant women and 
their children.

METHODS
The study cohort consisted of women and their children born 
in New South Wales (NSW), Australia, between January 1, 
2000 and August 31, 2008. Children’s health was followed until 
August 31, 2013. The NSW Centre for Health Record Linkage 
utilized probabilistic data linkage techniques to merge data of 
the following data sets: Record Linkage from the Perinatal Data 
Collection (PDC), Admitted Patient Data Collection, Register 
of Congenital Conditions, NSW Registry of Birth Deaths 
and Marriages, the Australian Bureau of Statistics—Socio-
Economic Indexes for Areas. Probabilistic record linkage soft-
ware assigns a “linkage weight” to pairs of records.19-21 For 
example, records that match perfectly or nearly perfectly on first 
name, surname, date of birth, and address have a high linkage 
weight and records that match only on date of birth have a low- 
linkage weight.19-21 If the linkage weight is high, it is likely that 
the records truly match, and if the linkage weight is low it is likely 
that the records are not truly a match.19-21 This technique has 
been shown to have a false- 
positive rate of 0.3% of records.19-21 
Several studies have evaluated the validity of the NSW linkage 
data and reported a tendency toward underreporting of maternal 
medical conditions during pregnancy.22,23 However, by com-
paring PDC and Admitted Patient Data Collection data with 
women’s individual medical records, it showed that conditions 
and procedures regarding delivery and discharge status had high 
specificity, indicating that false positives were uncommon.23,24
The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the 
NSW Population and Health Services Research Committee 
(HREC/10/CIPHS/96). The ethics privacy statement outlines 
that consent is waived due to the size of the data set, retro-
spective nature of the data, and the inherent difficulties in 
obtaining consent.
birth after induction or augmentation had the highest risk of jaundice, adjusted 
odds ratio (aOR) 2.75 (95% confidence interval [CI] 2.61- 
2.91) compared with 
spontaneous vaginal birth. Children born by cesarean delivery were particularly 
at statistically significantly increased risk for infections, eczema, and metabolic 
disorder, compared with spontaneous vaginal birth. Children born by emergency 
cesarean delivery showed the highest association for metabolic disorder, aOR 
2.63 (95% CI 2.26- 
3.07).
Conclusion: Children born by spontaneous vaginal birth had fewer short- 
 and longer-
term health problems, compared with those born after birth interventions.

2.1 | Data
Data were routinely collected from women who gave birth or 
had subsequent births in either a public or private hospital in 
NSW, Australia. Data of nulliparous and multiparous women 
were selected if they were low- 
risk pregnant women according 
to the guideline of the National Institute for Health and Care 
Excellence on intrapartum care and in alignment with methodol-
ogy previously utilized on this and other linked data sets.20,25,26 
This resulted in a cohort of “healthy pregnant women” who 
had no preexisting or pregnancy- 
related hypertension or dia-
betes, did not smoke or take drugs, were within the age range 
of 20- 
35 years, and gave birth at 37- 
41 weeks of gestation to 
a singleton baby in cephalic presentation with a birthweight of 
≥2500 g. In addition, children with minor or major congenital 
conditions were excluded based on the International Statistical 
Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 
Tenth Revision, Australian Modification codes (ICD- 
10- 
AM, 
Q0.0- 
Q99.9).25 Minor malformations could be related to more 
major malformations, which could be caused by genetic factors, 
for example, and which may become apparent some time after 
birth. Moreover, women and their children were excluded from 
the analyses if stillbirth or death had occurred during the 5- 
year 
follow- 
up period. By making this selection, we aimed to include 
a population of healthy pregnant women and their healthy born 
children, to reduce confounding and to increase the likelihood 
of finding the true association between exposure (birth interven-
tions) and outcomes (child’s health short and longer term).
Women or children with missing data on either mode of 
birth, maternal age, parity, gestational age, or birthweight 
were also excluded from the analyses since these variables 
have a potential effect on children’s health. If missing data 
on other variables occurred, that is, country of birth, so-
cioeconomic status, and infant gender, these variables were 
indicated as system missing in the linked data file and subse-
quently excluded from the logistic regression models.
2.2 | Variables
Mode of birth and birth interventions were collected from the 
PDC file and included: spontaneous vaginal birth, instrumental 
birth, elective cesarean delivery, and an emergency cesarean (ei-
ther with or without medical birth interventions). Medical birth 
interventions included induction or augmentation of labor with 
oxytocin, prostaglandin, and/or artificial rupture of membranes.
The short- 
term follow- 
up data of infants during the first 
28 days and of children up to 5 years of age included admis-
sions to public and private hospitals located in NSW (Admitted 
Patient Data Collection file). The children were followed from 
the date of birth until their fifth birthday to identify any adverse 
health outcomes which occurred during this time period. The 
classifying diagnoses and reasons with accompanying hospital 
visit dates were registered with ICD- 
10- 
AM- 
codes. Short- 
term 
adverse health outcomes included jaundice, feeding problems, 
and hypothermia and often are part of the adaptation of the 
infant to being outside the uterus.7,27,28 The longer-term ad-
verse health outcomes included asthma, respiratory infections 
(eg, common cold, pneumonia, bronchitis), gastrointestinal 
disorders, other infections (eg, sepsis, streptococcus, cystitis), 
metabolic disorder (eg, hypoglycemia, neonatal diabetes mel-
litus, diabetes mellitus type 1 or 2, localized adiposity), and 
eczema, based on the potential effect that mode of birth has 
on immune- 
related diseases.5-7,12-18 An overview of all adverse 
health outcomes and other covariates with corresponding ICD- 
10- 
AM codes are presented in the Supporting Information.
Potential confounders of either women or children charac-
teristics were selected from several data files. Women’s char-
acteristics were extracted from the PDC and NSW Registry of 
Birth Deaths and Marriages files and included, for example, 
age and country of birth. From the Socio- 
Economic Indexes 
for Areas file, the socioeconomic status of women were col-
lected and were based on area indices of income and education 
using women’s postal codes and defined as low (10- 
30 percen-
tiles), medium (40- 
60 percentiles) or high (≥70 percentiles). 
Pharmacological pain medication during labor and birth (ie, ni-
trous oxide, systematic opioid, local administered to perineum, 
pudendal, morphine, and pethidine), and anesthesia (ie, epi-
dural, caudal, and spinal) were extracted from the PDC file.
Children’s characteristics were extracted from the PDC 
and Admitted Patient Data Collection files and included gen-
der, gestational age, birthweight, small- 
for- 
gestational age, 
large-for-gestational age, and birth trauma (appendix).
2.3 | Data analyses
A retrospective analysis of prospectively collected linked data 
was performed. Baseline characteristics of the women and 
children were reported using descriptive statistics. Statistical 
differences in baseline characteristics in women and children 
in the different mode of birth and birth interventions group-
ings (ie, spontaneous vaginal birth, vaginal birth with induc-
tion or augmentation, instrumental birth, instrumental birth 
with induction or augmentation, elective cesarean delivery, 
emergency cesarean, and an emergency cesarean delivery 
after induction) were calculated with chi- 
square tests.
Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses 
were performed to examine the association between the ex-
posure variable and each child outcome. Spontaneous vaginal 
birth without induction or augmentation of labor was used 
as the reference group. The logistic regression models were 
adjusted for maternal characteristics (maternal age, country 
of birth, socioeconomic status, parity), birth characteris-
tics (pain medication during birth), and child characteristics 
(gender, gestational age, birthweight, small- 
for- 
gestational 
age, large-for-gestational age, birth trauma). Crude and ad-
justed odds ratios (OR) with corresponding 95% confidence

RESULTS
The total population linked data set contained the antenatal, 
birth, and postnatal details of 669 880 women and 1 097 762 
births which occurred in public or private hospitals during the 
study period 2000- 
2008 with a follow- 
up until age 5 years. A 
total 548 815 births (50%) were excluded due to medical or 
obstetric risk factors (eg, maternal morbidity, preterm birth) 
or substance abuse in pregnancy (eg, smoking or drug abuse). 
We excluded 54 254 (4.9%) children with congenital abnor-
malities. After applying all other exclusion criteria, mortality 
was recorded for 1638 (0.1%) children during the study period. 
There were 653 stillbirths, 353 cases of neonatal mortality, and 
632 of childhood mortality. The risk of neonatal mortality was 
similar across the different mode of births. Finally, 1465 cases 
were excluded due to missing data on either maternal charac-
teristics (ie, age, mode of birth, parity) or child characteristics 
(ie, gestational age, birthweight). The final study cohort con-
sisted of 491 590 healthy pregnant women and their children.
The majority of the women were Australian born (69%) 
and had a mean age of 29 (SD 4) years. Fifty- 
five percent of 
the women were nulliparous. About 38% had a spontaneous 
vaginal birth, 28% had a vaginal birth with induction or aug-
mentation, 4% had an instrumental birth without induction 
or augmentation, and 8% had an instrumental birth with in-
duction or augmentation. Eleven percent of these women had 
an elective cesarean delivery, 4% had an emergency cesar-
ean, and 7% had an emergency cesarean delivery after in-
duction or augmentation of labor (Table 1). Overall, 43% of 
the women included were induced before labor, or received 
augmentation during labor. The majority (88%) of women 
received pain medication and infant’s birth trauma was expe-
rienced in 3% of the births. Maternal (eg, socioeconomic sta-
tus), birth (eg, pain medication), and child characteristics (eg, 
gestational age) showed statistically significant differences 
across seven modes of the birth group (P ≤ .001, Table 1). 
Missing values ranged from 0.04% (ie, infant gender) to 0.3% 
(ie, socioeconomic status) in the final linked data set.
3.1 | Outcomes at short- 
term follow- 
up 
(first 28 days)
The prevalence of jaundice, feeding problems, and hypother-
mia were, respectively, 4%, 3%, and 2%. Compared with in-
fants who were born by spontaneous vaginal birth, all other 
infants born with either medical or operative birth interventions 
had significantly higher odds of jaundice and feeding problems, 
except for an elective cesarean delivery which was not associ-
ated with the risk of jaundice (P = .07). Infants born by instru-
mental vaginal birth after induction or augmentation showed 
the highest association of jaundice (crude OR 3.26 [95% CI 
3.12- 
3.41], adjusted OR [aOR] 2.75 [95% CI 2.61- 
2.91]). 
Significantly higher odds of hypothermia were observed for in-
fants born by all the specified cesarean groups compared with 
those born by spontaneous vaginal delivery (Table 2).
3.2 | Outcomes at longer-term follow- 
up (up 
to 5 years of age)
Diagnosed respiratory infections had the highest prevalence 
of any of the medical conditions during the 5- 
year follow- 
up 
period, 14%. The lowest prevalence was observed for gastro-
intestinal disorders, 0.5%. Other bacterial infections, sepsis, 
otitis, cystitis, or urethritis, were reported in 8% of the children 
in the study. There was no evidence to suggest an association 
between mode of birth and the odds of asthma. Metabolic dis-
order was reported in 1% of children and 3% were diagnosed 
with eczema. Compared with children born after spontane-
ous vaginal birth without induction or augmentation, all other 
groups had higher odds of respiratory infections, metabolic 
disorder, and eczema (Table 3). Odds of gastrointestinal dis-
orders were higher among children born after vaginal birth 
with induction or augmentation and after elective cesarean 
delivery. Other infections were more prevalent among all ex-
posure groups compared with those born after spontaneous 
vaginal birth without induction or augmentation. No statistical 
significant associations between other infections and groups 
born after instrumental birth either without or with induction 
or augmentation were observed (P- 
values .07 and .02, respec-
tively). Compared with children born by spontaneous vaginal 
birth, children born by cesarean delivery had higher odds of 
longer-term adverse health outcomes. Birth by elective cesar-
ean delivery aOR 2.49 (95% CI 2.19- 
2.82), an emergency ce-
sarean aOR 2.63 (95% CI 2.26- 
3.07), and emergency cesarean 
delivery after induction aOR 2.41 (95% CI 2.11- 
2.76) was as-
sociated with increased odds of metabolic disorder.

DISCUSSION
The aim of this study was to examine the association between 
medical birth interventions and/or operative birth interven-
tions on short- 
 and longer-term child health outcomes in 
healthy women and their children by analyzing population- 
based linked data. Our results showed that newborns born by 
instrumental birth after induction or augmentation were more 
likely to experience jaundice. Children born by cesarean de-
livery were particularly at increased risk for adverse health 
outcomes in the longer term, that is, respiratory infection, 
other infection, and metabolic disorder.

PETERS ET al.
There is emerging evidence that some birth interventions may 
have an effect on the neonatal immune response and the child’s 
health in the longer term.7,29 There is evidence of short- 
term 
health impacts for the infant after a cesarean delivery, such as 
hypothermia, impaired lung function, altered metabolism, altered 
blood pressure, and altered feeding, which is consistent with our 
results.7,27,28 Some of these changes might be due to a lack of 
labor stress, associated with physiological maladaptation after 
birth. Some epidemiological studies have linked the mode of birth 
(particularly cesarean delivery) to increasing rates of asthma and 
gastrointestinal disorders.15,17 However, other epidemiological 
studies did not report higher rates of asthma, diabetes type 1, obe-
sity, and inflammatory bowel disease for children born with birth 
interventions.12,16 Several studies that included meta- 
analyses re-
ported that children born by cesarean delivery were at higher risk 
of developing obesity, diabetes, or asthma in childhood.4,6,30,31
The EPIIC hypothesis postulated by some of the authors 
in this paper, proposes that nonphysiological interventions 
during the intrapartum period, and specifically the use of syn-
thetic oxytocin, epidural analgesia, and cesarean delivery, may 
interrupt the normal stress of being born.10,11 This could have 
an epigenetic effect on specific genes, such as those that pro-
gram immune responses, including weight regulation and me-
tabolism. In support of an epigenetic hypothesis in this area, 
an association between mode of birth and DNA methylation 
has previously been reported.32,33 Schlinzig et al examined 
37 term babies born by elective cesarean delivery (n = 16) or 
vaginal birth (n = 21) and found a higher global measure of 
DNA methylation if the infant was born by cesarean delivery. 
While there was a nonsignificant difference between vaginal 
birth and cesarean delivery at 3- 
5 days postpartum, the pat-
tern did not alter in the infants born vaginally but significantly

decreased in infants born by cesarean delivery.33 Almgren 
et al32 undertook a more precise analysis, looking at DNA 
from hematopoietic stem cells (CD34+). Those in specific 
gene sites that programmed for immune- 
mediated disease 
showed different methylation patterns in infants born by cesar-
ean delivery than those born vaginally.32 Furthermore, those 
infants born after shorter labor showed similar DNA methyla-
tion patterns to those born by cesarean, suggesting that physi-
ological labor stress over a certain period of time is required to 
program certain autoimmune responses in the neonate.
An alternative theory, the Extended Hygiene Hypothesis 
suggests that in utero, during a vaginal birth, and following 
skin- 
to- 
skin contact and breastfeeding, the infant needs to 
gather a community of microbes that come from the mother 
and the surrounding environment.8,9 Establishing the gut mi-
crobiota may be important in protecting the child, and later 
the adult, against atopic and immunological diseases.10,34 
Disturbances in this process could be linked to developing in-
fectious, inflammatory, and allergic diseases later in life.10,34 
However, some studies associate the mode of birth with dif-
ferences in the child’s microbiota, other conflicting results 
showed that there was no effect of cesarean delivery on the 
early microbiota beyond the immediate neonatal period.35
Despite this, there is a global awareness that cesarean de-
livery rates are too high. Currently, the emphasis is on labor 
induction to address this issue, as in, for example, a recently 
reported randomized controlled trial on routine induction 
of labor at 39 weeks in nulliparous women.36 Although this 
study showed a reduced cesarean delivery, our population 
level analysis shows that replacing one technical intervention 
with another might not improve longer-term outcomes. We 
suggest that those looking to reduce unnecessary interven-
tion could consider results of systematic reviews that show 
that relationship- 
based interventions, such as continuous sup-
port in labor, or continuity of midwifery care, are associated 
with decreased interventions, improved rates of physiologi-
cal birth, and higher levels of maternal reports of well being, 
without adversely affecting mortality and morbidity, and at 
reduced cost for women and health systems.37,38
Our study had several strengths and limitations. To our 
knowledge, this is the first study that has provided an over-
view of associations between all possible birth interventions 
and a wide range of adverse child health outcomes within a 
large population of healthy pregnant women and their chil-
dren. In our analyses, we adjusted for a range of confounders, 
including maternal characteristics, birth characteristics, and 
child characteristics. However, our associations could still 
be affected by unmeasured confounding, such as maternal 
body mass index, antibiotic use during pregnancy or admin-
istered during childhood until the age of 5, breast or artificial 
feeding, paternal characteristics, and familial environmental 
and genetic factors. Moreover, we were unable to control for 
confounding by indication since the underlying reasons for 
the provided medical and operative birth interventions were 
unknown.39 All of these factors may independently be as-
sociated with some of the health outcomes seen in children 
and therefore our findings must be interpreted with caution. 
It is possible that the routine use of intrapartum antibiotics 
also plays a role in the disturbance of the microbiome. As 
a consequence, the infant may experience adverse outcomes. 
Furthermore, experimental and laboratory- 
based studies are 
needed to determine the precise mechanism and contribution 
of the different factors to the outcome. While we included 
country of birth, we could not include ethnicity and this may 
also affect outcomes and associations. We were only able to 
examine admissions of the child to a hospital while visits to 
general practitioners were not incorporated, suggesting an un-
derreporting of adverse outcomes. Unfortunately, population- 
based linked data are restricted to the selection of variables 
and limited ability to verify the accuracy of the data, but do

provide a cost- 
effective way of establishing incidence and 
association of (rare) health outcomes and can direct future 
research.
Further research is required to confirm or refute the find-
ings from this study. Research ideally would include other 
population- 
based data registries, including a longer follow- 
up 
period for a wider range of adverse child health outcomes, 
particularly those that are found more commonly beyond 
5 years of age (eg, asthma). More research is also needed to 
explain some of the potential mechanisms at play, including 
epigenetic and microbiome research.
By analyzing linked population data, we obtained in-
sight into the association of medical and operative birth 
interventions and short- 
 and longer-term child health out-
comes. These results support the “Too little too late, too 
much too soon debate” in maternal care, in which Miller 
et al40 argued that unnecessary use of nonevidence- 
based 
interventions can be harmful for healthy women and 
infants, as much as a lack of lifesaving interventions is 
damaging for those that need them. Our results should 
make consumers and maternal health care professionals 
aware of the potential harm that birth interventions may 
have in the longer term, encouraging a “precautionary 
principle” approach that weighs the possible benefits of 
the intervention against its potential detrimental effects 
for each mother and child.41 The aim should always be 
to provide the right amount of care at the right time in 
the right way to childbearing women, with a clear as-
sessment of the potential consequences of just- 
in- 
case 
interventions.40
4.1 | Conclusion
Children born by spontaneous vaginal birth had fewer 
short- 
 and longer-term health problems, compared with 
those born after birth interventions. This suggests that 
when examining labor interventions, researchers need to 
pay attention to use of exogenous oxytocin and to instru-
mental and operative birth, and that follow- 
up should be 
continued into the longer term.
