IMPORTANCE Streptococcal infection has been linked with the development of
obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and tic disorders, a concept termed pediatric
autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infection (PANDAS).
However, previous studies of this association have been small, and the results have been
conflicting.
OBJECTIVE To investigate the risk of mental disorders, specifically OCD and tic disorders,
after a streptococcal throat infection.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A population-based cohort study was conducted using
data from the nationwide Danish registers from January 1, 1996, to December 31, 2013, with
up to 17 years of follow-up. The Danish National Health Service Register provided information
on individuals with the registration of a streptococcal test. Data analysis was conducted from
January 1, 2016, to February 28, 2017.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Individuals were followed up in the nationwide Psychiatric
Central Register for a diagnosis of any mental disorder, OCD, or tic disorders. Incidence rate
ratios (IRRs) were calculated by Poisson regression analysis.
RESULTS Of the 1 067 743 children (<18 years of age) included in the study (519 821 girls and
547 922 boys), 638 265 received a streptococcal test, 349 982 of whom had positive test
results at least once. Individuals with a positive streptococcal test result had an increased risk
of any mental disorder (n = 15 408; IRR, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.15-1.21; P < .001), particularly of OCD
(n = 556; IRR, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.28-1.77; P < .001) and tic disorders (n = 993; IRR, 1.35; 95% CI,
1.21-1.50; P < .001), compared with individuals without a streptococcal test. Furthermore, the
risk of any mental disorder and OCD was more elevated after a streptococcal throat infection
than after a nonstreptococcal infection. Nonetheless, individuals with a nonstreptococcal
throat infection also had an increased risk of any mental disorder (n = 11 315; IRR, 1.08; 95%
CI, 1.06-1.11; P < .001), OCD (n = 316; IRR, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.07-1.53; P = .006), and tic disorders
(n = 662; IRR, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.12-1.41; P < .001).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This large-scale study investigating key aspects of the
PANDAS hypothesis found that individuals with a streptococcal throat infection had elevated
risks of mental disorders, particularly OCD and tic disorders. However, nonstreptococcal
throat infection was also associated with increased risks, although less than streptococcal
infections for OCD and any mental disorder, which could also support important elements of
the diagnostic concept of pediatric acute-onset neuropsychiatric syndrome.

I
n recent years, an increasing body of evidence has pointed
toward a critical role of the immune system and infec-
tions in the development of mental disorders.1-3 Child-
hood obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and tic disorders
have been suggested to be associated with infections caused
by group A β-hemolytic streptococcus, a hypothesis termed
pediatricautoimmuneneuropsychiatricdisordersassociatedwith
streptococcal infection (PANDAS),4 which are suggested to be
caused by molecular mimicry in which antibodies directed to-
ward the streptococcal bacteria cross-react with the basal gan-
glia of the brain, possibly owing to structural similarities be-
tween the streptococcal cell surface and proteins of the basal
ganglia.5 This hypothesis is supported by findings of autoan-
tibodies directed toward the basal ganglia in the serum of
children with PANDAS compared with that of controls6,7 and
by the results of imaging studies suggesting inflammation in
these parts of the brain in individuals with PANDAS com-
pared with controls.8 Moreover, a study observing 12 chil-
dren with PANDAS for 3 years found that exacerbations of OCD
and tic disorders were associated with preceding streptococ-
cal infections.9 Furthermore, studies have found that immu-
notherapy has a positive effect on symptoms of OCD and tic
disorders in children with PANDAS,10,11 indicating that auto-
immune-based mechanisms may play a causal role.
However, the PANDAS hypothesis remains controversial,
and most prior studies are small and have methodological
shortcomings.Furthermore,notallstudiesconfirmedthefind-
ingsofautoantibodiesagainstthebasalgangliainchildrenwith
PANDAS,12-14 and several other studies also did not support the
PANDAS hypothesis,15-18 including recent investigations of the
effect of immunotherapy.19 Studies with the most intensive
clinicalobservationandtestingeitherdidnotfindrecentstrep-
tococcal infections to worsen neuropsychiatric symptoms in
individuals with PANDAS17 or found that most of the neuro-
psychiatric worsening occurred in individuals with no asso-
ciation with a preceding streptococcal infection,18 thereby
questioning the core criterion of PANDAS. Furthermore, many
studies are limited by short-term follow-up, recall bias, and
cross-sectional design.
We investigated the risk of any mental disorders, with par-
ticular focus on OCD and tic disorders, in children exposed to
streptococcal throat infection in the largest population-
based cohort study to date, to our knowledge, using the na-
tionwide Danish registers. We observed the cohort for up to
17 years without loss to follow-up with an investigation of age
at the time of streptococcal throat infection, the timing and
number of streptococcal infections, and stratified by sex and
personal or parental history of autoimmune disease.
Methods
The Registers
All Danish residents are assigned a unique identification num-
ber by the Danish Civil Registration System, permitting link-
age between the national registers and including information
on parents and siblings.20 Psychiatric inpatient contacts since
1969 are available in the Danish Psychiatric Central Research
Register,21 and somatic inpatient contacts since 1977 are avail-
able in the National Hospital Register22; since 1995, both reg-
isters also include outpatient contacts.21,22 The Danish Na-
tional Health Service Register documents activities of general
practitioners since 1990.23 Data on filled prescriptions since
1994 are accessible in the Danish National Prescription
Registry.24 Registered diagnoses are defined according to the
International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related
Health Problems, Tenth Revision, codes. The study was ap-
proved by the Danish Data Protection Agency, who waived the
need for patient consent.
Study Population
Individuals born in Denmark between January 1, 1996, and
December 31, 2013, were identified by their identification
number and followed up until death, emigration, or Decem-
ber 31, 2013. Individuals were followed up in the Danish
National Health Service Register for a record of a rapid anti-
gen diagnostic test for group A β-hemolytic streptococcal
throat infection (streptococcal test) performed by the gen-
eral practitioner and in the Danish National Prescription
Registry for a history of subsequently filled antibiotics. Indi-
viduals with a record of a streptococcal test were followed
up in the Danish Psychiatric Central Register using the first-
time psychiatric diagnoses during the period from 1996 to
2013. Because hospital contact, including emergency depart-
ment contact, for infections is a known risk factor for mental
disorders,1,2 individuals with a record of hospital treatment
for infections were censored, as were individuals with a psy-
chiatric diagnosis.
Assessment of Mental Disorders
The Danish Psychiatric Central Register provided informa-
tion on the outcome diagnoses of OCD, tic disorders includ-
ing Tourette syndrome, and an outcome category of all men-
tal disorders (eTable 1 in the Supplement). In the rare case of
the registration of first-time psychiatric diagnoses of both OCD
and a tic disorder on the same day, these individuals were
counted in both groups. Because some of the cases might have
Key Points
Question Is streptococcal throat infection associated with
obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and tic disorders, as
suggested by the pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric
disorders associated with streptococcal infection (PANDAS)
hypothesis?
Findings In this population-based cohort study, streptococcal
throat infections increased the risk of any mental disorder, OCD,
and tic disorders; however, compared with nonstreptococcal
throat infections, only the risk of any mental disorder and OCD
was significantly higher after a streptococcal infection.
Meaning The PANDAS hypothesis was supported to some extent,
but because other infections also increased the risk of mental
disorders, our results could also support aspects of the wider
diagnostic concept of pediatric acute-onset neuropsychiatric
syndrome.

been diagnosed by pediatricians instead of psychiatrists, psy-
chiatric diagnoses were also obtained from the National Hos-
pital Register.
Assessment of Streptococcal Throat Infection
The Danish National Health Service Register provided infor-
mation on individuals registered with a streptococcal test (reg-
ister code 7109) but without information on the test result.
Hence, the combination of a streptococcal test and an antibi-
otic prescription filled within 8 days of the test (eTable 1 in the
Supplement) was used as a proxy for positive test results, and
tests without an antibiotic were counted as negative test re-
sults. Because we had information only on the week in which
the test was conducted, we determined the day of testing to
be Monday. Individuals with negative test results probably had
a nonstreptococcal throat infection and were included in the
study to explore whether the risk of mental disorders was spe-
cificforstreptococcalinfections.Individualswithatleast1posi-
tive test result remained in the cohort of individuals with posi-
tive test results regardless of any exposure to negative test
results. Hence, individuals with negative test results had only
negative results and no positive test results. If an individual
had2ormorepositivestreptococcaltestresultswithin4weeks,
it was counted as 1 infection.
Statistical Analyses
StatisticalanalysiswasconductedfromJanuary1,2016,toFeb-
ruary 28, 2017. Survival analysis was performed in Stata, ver-
sion 13.1 (StataCorp), and incidence rate ratios (IRRs) were es-
timated by Poisson regression. The basic model adjusted for
age, sex, and calendar year, and the fully adjusted model fur-
ther adjusted for socioeconomic factors (parental marital sta-
tus, educational level, and income), family history of mental
disorders, and personal or parental history of autoimmune dis-
eases. Variables were available from the Danish Civil Regis-
tration System, the Danish Psychiatric Central Research Reg-
ister, the National Hospital Register, and Statistics Denmark.
All variables except sex were treated as time dependent. In ad-
dition, we conducted a case-control study by matching pa-
tients with full siblings who had not received a diagnosis of
mental disorder at the age when the patient became consid-
ered a case. We controlled for sex and calendar year by con-
ditional logistic regression. Each case with sibling(s) made a
stratum in which the streptococcal test preceded the mental
disorder of the patient (in age) as an analog to a time-
dependent variable. P < .05 was considered significant. Fur-
ther information regarding statistical analyses is available in
the eAppendix in the Supplement.
Results

and followed up for up to 17 years, corresponding to 7.9 mil-
lion person-years at risk. A total of 638 265 children (<18 years
of age) were registered with at least 1 streptococcal test, of
whom 349 982 individuals (54.8%) had at least 1 positive test
result. During the study period, 40 435 children received a di-
agnosis of a mental disorder, of whom 15 408 individuals

of 1078 individuals received a diagnosis of OCD, of whom 556
children (51.6%) had a previous positive streptococcal test re-

993 children (45.6%) had a previous positive streptococcal test

Supplement, displaying only small differences between the
group of individuals who did not undergo a streptococcal test
and those with negative or positive test results.

test results compared with those with negative test results.
The risk of any mental disorder, OCD, and tic disorders
increased linearly in a dose-response manner with an
increasing number of negative streptococcal test results
(Table 2). Likewise, the risk of any mental disorder increased
linearly with the number of positive test results. The IRRs
for all outcomes tended to increase throughout the time
after a positive test result; in particular, the risk did not
appear to be highest in the proximate period following the
test (Table 3). Case-sibling analyses displayed a 94%
increased risk of OCD (odds ratio, 1.94; 95% CI, 1.18-3.20) for
children with positive test results compared with siblings
with a negative test result, while the remaining estimates
were insignificant (eTable 4 in the Supplement).
Individuals 3 to 11 years of age with positive streptococ-
cal test results had the largest IRRs for OCD (1.55; 95% CI,
1.30-1.83) and tic disorders (1.41; 95% CI, 1.25-1.58) (Table 4);
however, the differences across age groups were not signifi-
cant. The risk of any mental disorder was highest for indi-
viduals with a positive test result at 12 years of age or older
(IRR, 1.73; 95% CI, 1.60-1.86; P < .001). Moreover, there was
an interaction between undergoing a streptococcal test and
sex with regard to the risk of any mental disorder, with a sig-
nificantly larger risk for female compared with male indi-
viduals with positive test results and a greater risk in male
rather than female individuals with negative test results
(eTable 5 in the Supplement). We did not find an interaction
between a positive or negative test result and a parental or
personal history of autoimmune disease regarding any of the
outcomes (eTable 5 in the Supplement).
Discussion
This large population-based cohort study showed that indi-
viduals with positive streptococcal test results and thereby
probable streptococcal throat infections had an 18% in-
creasedriskofanymentaldisorder,a51%increasedriskofOCD,
and a 35% increased risk of tic disorders compared with indi-
viduals who had never been tested for streptococcal infec-
tion. However, individuals with a negative streptococcal test
result who thereby most likely had a nonstreptococcal throat
infection also had an increased risk of mental disorders. None-
theless,individualswithastreptococcalinfectionhadagreater
risk of any mental disorder and OCD compared with those with
a nonstreptococcal throat infection. The associations per-
sisted after adjusting for possible confounders, and the risk of
OCD was 94% larger for individuals with positive test results
compared with siblings with negative test results.
Our findings that individuals with a streptococcal infec-
tion had an increased risk of OCD and tic disorders support the
PANDAShypothesistosomeextent,inlinewithfindingsofpre-
vious studies.9,25-28 Obsessive-compulsive disorder, tic disor-
ders, and Tourette syndrome have been associated with an in-
creased occurrence of streptococcal infection 3 to 12 months
before a psychiatric diagnosis compared with controls, based
on a study of 742 cases27 and a study of 144 cases.26 The as-
sociation was even stronger after multiple streptococcal
infections,26 similar to our findings of a dose-response asso-
ciation with the number of streptococcal infections and any
mental disorder. A follow-up study of 45 individuals with
Tourette syndrome and/or OCD found that streptococcal in-
fections were associated with worsening of neuropsychiatric
symptoms.25 The diagnostic criteria of PANDAS state that the
neuropsychiatric symptoms debut from the age of 3 years un-
til the beginning of puberty4; we also found that individuals
3 to 11 years of age had the greatest tendency of an increased
risk of OCD and tic disorders, whereas the risk of any mental
disorder was highest in the group older than 11 years of age.
Nonetheless, our findings that the risk of mental disor-
dersisonlyslightlylesselevatedafteranonstreptococcalthroat
infectionthanafterastreptococcalinfectionsuggestthatother,
possibly viral, infectious agents are also linked with the de-
velopment of OCD and tic disorders. This finding might in-
steadsupporttherecentlyproposedconceptofpediatricacute-
onset neuropsychiatric syndrome, even though the main
diagnostic criteria exclude tic disorders and include a re-
stricted food intake.29 Pediatric acute-onset neuropsychiat-
ric syndrome offers an alternative to PANDAS with wider di-
agnostic criteria; it is primarily thought to be a postinfectious
condition but without restriction to streptococcal infections.
In our study, individuals with negative streptococcal test re-
sults had an 8% increased risk of any mental disorder, a 28%
increased risk of OCD, and a 25% increased risk of tic disor-
ders compared with individuals who had never been tested
for streptococcal throat infection. Furthermore, the nonstrep-
tococcal throat infections also displayed a dose-response
association. Other studies have found that the debut and wors-
ening of OCD and tic disorders can also be linked to nonstrep-

tococcal infectious agents,27,28,30,31 including the study by
Swedo et al4 describing the first 50 cases of PANDAS. Another
aspect that does not seem to entirely confirm PANDAS in our
studyistheincreasedriskofanymentaldisorder,notonlyOCD
and tic disorders, after a streptococcal infection. In line with
this finding, psychiatric comorbidity is common when inves-
tigating children who received a diagnosis of PANDAS.4,17,18,25
However, in our study, individuals with streptococcal infec-
tion did have a larger risk of the subsequent development of
OCD and tic disorders than of any mental disorders; this find-
ing favors a specific association between streptococcal infec-
tion and OCD and tic disorders. Furthermore, not all previous
studies have supported the PANDAS hypothesis.15-18 The pre-
viously largest study of streptococcal infection and mental dis-
orders investigated 2596 individuals with streptococcal infec-
tion based on a research database and found that only
inpatients (ie, patients with severe streptococcal infections)
had an increased risk of all outcomes as a combined group and
an increased risk of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder,
whereas the risk of OCD and tic disorders was only insignifi-
cantly increased.32 Other studies did not find a temporal link
between neuropsychiatric worsening and streptococcal
infection17 or found a temporal link in only a few of the cases
but with more than 75% of the neuropsychiatric worsening oc-
curring without an association with streptococcal infection.18
We did not find the risk of the outcomes to be highest in close
proximity to the streptococcal infection, which can probably
not be explained merely by a diagnostic delay.

The association between streptococcal and nonstrepto-
coccal infections and mental disorders could also be an epi-
phenomenon instead of representing causality. Some par-
ents might have an increased focus on somatic and psychiatric
symptoms,promptingmorefrequentvisitstothegeneralprac-
titioner in spite of only few symptoms of throat infection, in-
ducingtheregistrationofstreptococcaltestsandlikewisemore
frequentexaminationanddiagnosisbyapsychiatrist.Wemight
partially adjust for this medical care–seeking behavior by ad-
justing for socioeconomic factors and probably adjusting even
more in our case-sibling design, which still found an in-
creased risk of OCD in patients with a streptococcal throat in-
fection compared with control siblings. However, our results
for both positive and negative streptococcal test results did not
change significantly in the fully adjusted model that in-
cluded socioeconomic factors and a family history of mental
disorders,whichisalsoinlinewithpreviouscontradictoryfind-
ings regarding socioeconomic status as a risk factor for OCD.33
Moreover, mental disorders have been linked to immune-
related genes and genetic susceptibility to infections.34 Auto-
immune diseases might account for the increased occurrence
of infections in these individuals; previous studies have also
found that a family history of autoimmune diseases appears
more frequently among children who received a diagnosis of
PANDAS.18,35 However, we did not find that individuals with
a history of personal or parental autoimmune diseases had a
more elevated risk of any of the outcomes after a streptococ-
cal or nonstreptococcal throat infection.
Strengths and Limitations
This large nationwide cohort had up to 17 years of follow-up
without any loss to follow-up, which are major strengths of our
study and make selection bias an unlikely explanation for our
findings. In addition, information on streptococcal tests and
outcomes were registered prospectively, which excludes re-
call bias. The inclusion of a case-sibling design allowed us to
accountforunmeasuredsocialandenvironmentalfactorseven
though these analyses included fewer cases and the control
siblings might also have been exposed to a streptococcal throat
infection without receiving treatment. The limitations of the
study include the use of a proxy method for defining a posi-
tive streptococcal test result, which allowed us to interpret this
finding only as a presumed streptococcal throat infection. Fur-
thermore, misclassification would occur in cases in which an
antibiotic was prescribed to an individual with a negative test
result to treat a nonstreptococcal bacterial infection or in cases
in which an individual received an antibiotic for a streptococ-
cal throat infection based only on the clinical symptoms with-
out undergoing a streptococcal test. Hence, it might have been
appropriate to perform sensitivity analyses excluding indi-
viduals in the control group who were receiving antibiotics;
however, such analyses were beyond the extent of our study.
The streptococcal test is targeted at group A β-hemolytic strep-
tococcus, so throat infection with other types of streptococ-
cus would lead to a negative test result, which probably di-
lutes the effect of a positive test result. Also, a meta-analysis36
found that 14% of the streptococcal test results are false nega-
tives,whichmightaddtothedilutingeffect.Onlyhospitalcon-
tacts for mental disorders are covered by the registers; hence,
individuals treated by general practitioners or private pedia-
tricians or psychiatrists are not included in our study. Even
though the onset of OCD and tic disorders might have been
abrupt and accompanied by other co-occurring psychiatric
symptoms,whichareimportantelementsofPANDAS,4thereg-
isters did not provide such information, which is why we were
abletoexploreonlykeyaspectsofPANDAS,andmightnothave
been able to identify the rare and true cases of PANDAS. Al-
though we found an association, the absolute risk of OCD and
tic disorders after a streptococcal throat infection is still small.
Inaddition,othernoninfectiousenvironmentalfactorsthatwe
were not able to include could have influenced the associa-
tion with OCD, tic disorders, and Tourette syndrome.33,37,38
Conclusions
We found that both individuals with a streptococcal throat in-
fection and individuals with a nonstreptococcal throat infec-
tion had an increased risk of any mental disorder, OCD, and
tic disorders; however, the risk of all mental disorders and of
OCD was greatest in individuals with streptococcal throat in-
fections.Ourresultscouldfavoressentialelementsofthewider
diagnostic concept of pediatric acute-onset neuropsychiatric
syndrome.
