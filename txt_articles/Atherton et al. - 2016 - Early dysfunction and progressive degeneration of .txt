Abstract The subthalamic nucleus (STN) is an element of cortico-basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical
circuitry critical for action suppression. In Huntington’s disease (HD) action suppression is impaired,
resembling the effects of STN lesioning or inactivation. To explore this potential linkage, the STN
was studied in BAC transgenic and Q175 knock-in mouse models of HD. At <2 and 6 months of
age autonomous STN activity was impaired due to activation of KATP channels. STN neurons
exhibited prolonged NMDA receptor-mediated synaptic currents, caused by a deficit in glutamate
uptake, and elevated mitochondrial oxidant stress, which was ameliorated by NMDA receptor
antagonism. STN activity was rescued by NMDA receptor antagonism or the break down of
hydrogen peroxide. At 12 months of age approximately 30% of STN neurons had been lost, as in
HD. Together, these data argue that dysfunction within the STN is an early feature of HD that may
contribute to its expression and course.

Introduction
The basal ganglia are a network of subcortical brain nuclei that are critical for action selection and
central to the expression of several psychomotor disorders (Albin et al., 1989; Wichmann and
DeLong, 1996). Information flow from the cortex to the output nuclei of the basal ganglia occurs via
three major pathways. The so-called direct pathway through the striatum promotes movement and
‘rewarding’ behavior through inhibition of GABAergic basal ganglia output (Chevalier and Deniau,
1990; Kravitz et al., 2010; Kravitz and Kreitzer, 2012). In contrast, the indirect pathway via the
striatum, external globus pallidus and subthalamic nucleus (STN) and the hyperdirect pathway
through the STN suppress the same processes through elevation of basal ganglia output
(Maurice et al., 1999; Tachibana et al., 2008; Kravitz et al., 2010; Kravitz and Kreitzer, 2012).
Indeed, interruption of the indirect and hyperdirect pathways through lesion or inactivation of the
STN is associated with elevated/involuntary movement, impulsivity and psychiatric disturbances such
as hypomania
and
hyper-sexuality
(Crossman
et al.,
1988;
Hamada
and DeLong,
1992;
Baunez and Robbins, 1997; Bickel et al., 2010; Jahanshahi et al., 2015).
Huntington’s disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant, neurodegenerative disorder caused by an
expansion of CAG repeats in the gene (HTT) encoding huntingtin (HTT), a protein involved in vesicle
dynamics and intracellular transport (Huntington’s Disease Collaborative Research Group, 1993;
Saudou and Humbert, 2016). Early symptoms of HD include involuntary movement, compulsive
behavior, paranoia, irritability and aggression (Anderson and Marder, 2001; Kirkwood et al.,
2001). These symptoms have traditionally been linked to cortico-striatal degeneration, however a
role for the STN is suggested by their similarity to those caused by STN inactivation or lesion. The
hypoactivity of the STN in HD models in vivo (Callahan and Abercrombie, 2015a, 2015b) and the

 susceptibility of the STN to degeneration in HD (Lange et al., 1976; Guo et al., 2012) are also con-
sistent with STN dysfunction.
Several mouse models of HD have been generated, which vary by length and species origin of
HTT/Htt, CAG repeat length, and method of genome insertion. For example, one line expresses full-
length human HTT with 97 mixed CAA-CAG repeats in a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC;
Gray et al., 2008), whereas Q175 knock-in (KI) mice have an inserted chimeric human/mouse exon
one with a human polyproline region and ~188 CAG repeats in the native Htt (Menalled et al.,
2012).
Increased mitochondrial oxidant stress exacerbated by abnormal NMDAR-mediated transmission
and signaling has been reported in HD and its models (Fan and Raymond, 2007; Song et al., 2011;
Johri et al., 2013; Parsons and Raymond, 2014; Martin et al., 2015). Several reports suggest that
glutamate uptake is impaired due to reduced expression of the glutamate transporter EAAT2 (GLT-
1) and/or GLT-1 dysfunction (Arzberger et al., 1997; Lie
´vens et al., 2001; Behrens et al., 2002;
Miller et al., 2008; Bradford et al., 2009; Faideau et al., 2010; Huang et al., 2010;
Menalled et al., 2012; Dvorzhak et al., 2016; Jiang et al., 2016). However, others have found no
evidence for deficient glutamate uptake (Parsons et al., 2016), suggesting that abnormal NMDAR-
mediated transmission is caused by increased expression of extrasynaptic receptors and/or aberrant
coupling to signaling pathways (e.g., Parsons and Raymond, 2014). The sensitivity of mitochondria
to anomalous NMDAR signaling is likely to be further compounded by their intrinsically compro-
mised status in HD (Song et al., 2011; Johri et al., 2013; Martin et al., 2015).
Although HD models exhibit pathogenic processes seen in HD, they do not exhibit similar levels
and spatiotemporal patterns of cortico-striatal neurodegeneration. Striatal neuronal loss in aggres-
sive Htt fragment models such as R6/2 mice does occur but only close to death (Stack et al., 2005),
whereas full-length models exhibit minimal loss (Gray et al., 2008; Smith et al., 2014). Despite
the loss and hypoactivity of STN neurons in HD and the similarity of HD symptoms to those arising
from STN lesion or inactivation, the role of the STN in HD remains poorly understood. We hypothe-
sized that the abnormal activity and progressive loss of STN neurons in HD may reflect abnormalities
within the STN itself. This hypothesis was addressed in the BAC and Q175 KI HD models using a
combination of cellular and synaptic electrophysiology, optogenetic interrogation, two-photon imag-
ing and stereological cell counting.
Results
Data are reported as median [interquartile range]. Unpaired and paired statistical comparisons were
made with non-parametric Mann-Whitney U and Wilcoxon Signed-Rank tests, respectively. Fisher’s
exact test was used for categorical data. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant; where mul-
tiple comparisons were performed this p-value was adjusted using the Holm-Bonferroni method
(adjusted p-values are denoted ph; Holm, 1979). Box plots show median (central line), interquartile
range (box) and 10–90% range (whiskers).
The autonomous activity of STN neurons is disrupted in the BACHD
model
STN neurons exhibit intrinsic, autonomous firing, which contributes to their role as a driving force of
neuronal activity in the basal ganglia (Bevan and Wilson, 1999; Beurrier et al., 2000;
Do
and Bean, 2003). To determine whether this property is compromised in HD mice, the autonomous
activity of STN neurons in ex vivo brain slices prepared from BACHD and wild type littermate (WT)
mice were compared using non-invasive, loose-seal, cell-attached patch clamp recordings. 5–7
months old, symptomatic and 1–2 months old, presymptomatic mice were studied (Gray et al.,
2008). Recordings focused on the lateral two-thirds of the STN, which receives input from the motor
cortex (Kita and Kita, 2012; Chu et al., 2015). At 5–7 months, 124/128 (97%) WT neurons exhibited
autonomous activity compared to 110/126 (87%) BACHD neurons (p = 0.0049; Figure 1A,B). The
frequency (WT: 7.9 [5.2–12.6] Hz; n = 128; BACHD: 6.3 [1.4–10.2] Hz; n = 126; p = 0.0001) and regu-
larity (WT CV: 0.27 [0.14–0.47]; n = 124; BACHD CV: 0.36 [0.20–0.80]; n = 110; p = 0.0012) of firing
were reduced in BACHD neurons (Figure 1A,B). The distribution of firing frequency of WT neurons
appears unimodal with a mode at ~6–8 Hz (Figure 1C), whereas the distribution of BACHD neurons
is relatively bimodal with modes at ~0–2 Hz and ~8–10 Hz (Kolmogorov–Smirnov test, p = 0.0002;

 Figure 1C). This distribution suggests that BACHD neurons consist of a phenotypic population with
compromised autonomous firing, and a non-phenotypic population with relatively normal autono-
mous firing. At 1–2 months 136/145 (94%) WT STN neurons were autonomously active versus 120/
143 (84%) BACHD STN neurons (p = 0.0086). The frequency (WT: 9.8 [6.3–14.8] Hz; n = 145;
BACHD: 7.1 [1.8–11.3] Hz; n = 143; p < 0.0001) and regularity (WT CV: 0.17 [0.13–0.26]; n = 136;
BACHD CV: 0.23 [0.14–0.76]; n = 120; p = 0.0016) of firing were also reduced in BACHD neurons.
Together, these data demonstrate that the autonomous activity of STN neurons in BACHD mice is
impaired at both early presymptomatic and later symptomatic ages.
NMDAR-mediated EPSCs are prolonged in BACHD STN neurons
As described above, the majority of studies report that astrocytic glutamate uptake is diminished in
the striatum in HD and its models. To test whether the STN of BACHD mice exhibits a similar deficit,
EPSCs arising from the optogenetic stimulation of motor cortical inputs to the STN (as described by
Chu et al., 2015) were compared in WT and BACHD mice before and after inhibition of GLT-1 and
GLAST with 100 nM TFB-TBOA. STN neurons were recorded in ex vivo brain slices in the whole-cell
voltage-clamp configuration using a cesium-based, QX-314-containing internal solution to maximize
voltage control. Neurons were held at �40 mV and recorded in the presence of low (0.1 mM) exter-
nal Mg2+ and the AMPAR antagonist DNQX (20 mM) to maximize and pharmacologically isolate the
evoked NMDAR-mediated excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC); analysis was performed on aver-
age EPSCs from 5 trials with 30 s recovery between trials (Figure 1D–H). The amplitude weighted
decay time constant of the NMDAR EPSC was moderately but significantly prolonged in BACHD
compared to WT neurons (WT: 38.1 [30.0–44.8] ms; n = 12; BACHD: 47.6 [38.7–55.9] ms; n = 11;
p = 0.0455; Figure 1E–H). Subsequent application of TFB-TBOA increased the decay time constant
of the NMDAR EPSC in STN neurons derived from WT (WT control: 39.0 [35.2–44.0] ms; WT TFB-
TBOA: 50.2 [41.7–68.4] ms; n = 9; p = 0.0039; Figure 1E,H) but had no effect in BACHD neurons
(BACHD control: 47.9 [38.9–59.4] ms; BACHD TFB-TBOA: 44.9 [34.7–52.2] ms; n = 10; p = 0.3223;
Figure 1F,H). In control conditions, the amplitudes of EPSCs recorded from WT and BACHD neu-
rons were similar (WT: 50.1 [34.7–61.0] pA; n = 12; BACHD: 45.6 [22.1–78.3] pA; n = 11; ph =
0.7399; Figure 2A) and there was no correlation between EPSC amplitude and the decay time con-
stant in either group (WT: r2 = 0.16; n = 12; ph = 0.5871; BACHD: r2 = 0.10; n = 12; ph = 0.6686;
Figure 2B). In order to increase spillover of glutamate from synaptic release sites, cortico-STN inputs
were optogenetically stimulated 5 times at 50 Hz and the resulting compound NMDAR-mediated
EPSC was compared in WT and BACHD STN neurons. Interestingly, the decay of compound
NMDAR EPSCs under control conditions or following inhibition of glutamate uptake were not differ-
ent in WT and BACHD mice (WT control: 79.0 [62.6–102.0] ms; n = 6; BACHD control: 65.2 [44.7–
111.5] ms; n = 6; p = 0.4848; WT TFB-TBOA: 125.4 [106.8–146.6] ms; n = 6; BACHD TFB-TBOA:
108.3 [94.5–143.1] ms; n = 6; p = 0.6991; Figure 2C–E). Together, these data demonstrate that indi-
vidual, but not compound, NMDAR-mediated cortico-STN synaptic EPSCs are prolonged in the
BACHD model.

 Blockade of NMDARs rescues the autonomous activity of BACHD STN
neurons
To test whether disrupted autonomous firing in BACHD is linked to NMDAR activation, brain slices
from BACHD mice were incubated in control media or media containing the NMDAR antagonist
D-AP5 (50 mM) for 3–5 hr prior to loose-seal, cell-attached recordings from STN neurons (Figure 3).
D-AP5 treatment rescued autonomous firing in slices derived from 5–7 month old BACHD mice com-
pared to untreated control slices (Figure 3A,B). The proportion of autonomously active neurons was
greater in D-AP5 pre-treated slices (untreated: 18/30 (60%); D-AP5 treated: 29/30 (97%);
p = 0.0011). The frequency (untreated: 1.0 [0.0–7.6] Hz; n = 30; D-AP5 treated: 13.2 [7.9–17.4] Hz;
n = 30; p < 0.0001) and regularity (untreated CV: 0.43 [0.24–1.21]; n = 18; D-AP5 treated: CV: 0.13
[0.09–0.20]; n = 29; p < 0.0001) of autonomous firing were also greater in D-AP5 treated slices. In sli-
ces derived from 1–2 month old BACHD mice autonomous firing was also more prevalent in D-AP5
treated slices than in untreated slices (untreated: 10/30 (33%); D-AP5-treated: 27/30 neurons (90%);
p < 0.0001) and the frequency of firing overall was greater (untreated: 0.0 [0.0–1.3] Hz; n = 30;
D-AP5 treated: 8.7 [4.4–14.5] Hz; n = 30; p < 0.0001; Figure 3B). The regularity of autonomous firing
was however not rescued (untreated CV: 0.61 [0.27–0.81]; n = 10; D-AP5-treated CV: 0.25 [0.14–
0.69]; n = 27; p = 0.1368; Figure 3B). In slices from WT mice the rate (untreated: 10.4 [6.1–14.2] Hz;
n = 27; D-AP5 treated: 5.6 [1.7–15.4] Hz; n = 27; p = 0.1683; Figure 3B), regularity (untreated: 0.18
[0.12–0.27]; n = 24; D-AP5 treated: 0.22 [0.12–0.46]; n = 22; p = 0.4785; Figure 3C) and incidence of
firing (untreated: 24/27 (89%); D-AP5 treated 22/27 (81%); p = 0.7040; Figure 3D) were unaltered
by D-AP5 treatment. Thus, prolonged blockade of NMDARs rescued autonomous firing in BACHD
STN neurons but had no effect on autonomous activity in WT STN neurons. Together, these data
demonstrate that NMDAR activation contributes to the disruption of autonomous activity in BACHD
STN neurons.
The mitochondria of BACHD STN neurons are subject to elevated
oxidant stress
NMDAR activation can elevate mitochondrial oxidant stress (Dugan et al., 1995; Moncada and
Bolan
˜os, 2006; Brennan et al., 2009; Nakamura and Lipton, 2011). To test whether STN neurons
from BACHD mice exhibit increased mitochondrial oxidant stress, a mitochondria-targeted redox
probe MTS-roGFP (Hanson et al., 2004) was virally expressed in 5–7-month-old BACHD mice and
WT littermates (Figure 4A). 1–2 weeks later MTS-roGFP was imaged in brain slices under two-pho-
ton excitation with 890 nm light. Oxidant stress was estimated from the fluorescence of MTS-roGFP
in individual neurons under baseline conditions relative to the fluorescence of MTS-roGFP under
conditions of full reduction and oxidation in the presence of 2 mM dithiothreitol and 200 mM aldri-
thiol-4, respectively (Sanchez-Padilla et al., 2014). STN neurons were selected for analysis based on
their appearance under two-photon, Dodt contrast imaging and were distinguishable from STN glial
cells by their relatively large diameter (Figure 4A). STN neurons are reliably recorded when this
selection strategy is employed to guide patch clamp recording (Atherton et al., 2008, 2010). MTS-
roGFP imaging revealed that relative oxidant stress in BACHD STN neurons was elevated compared

 to WT (WT: 0.35 [0.18–0.42]; n = 23; BACHD: 0.40 [0.37–0.63]; n = 24; p = 0.0332; Figure 4B). In a
separate experiment (performed 15 months later) to test whether NMDAR activation ex vivo contrib-
uted to elevated mitochondrial oxidant stress, brain slices from a different cohort of BACHD mice
were treated for >3 hr in 50 mM D-AP5 prior to imaging. MTS-roGFP imaging confirmed that D-AP5-
treated slices exhibited lower oxidant stress compared to untreated slices from the same mice
(untreated: 0.39 [0.35–0.48]; n = 13; D-AP5-treated: 0.32 [0.24–0.42]; n = 17; p = 0.0445;
Figure 4C). Thus, STN neurons from BACHD mice exhibit elevated mitochondrial oxidant stress,
which can be reduced by antagonism of NMDARs.
Impaired autonomous activity of STN neurons in BACHD mice is due to
increased activation of KATP channels
NMDAR receptor-generated mitochondrial oxidant stress in BACHD may lead to the activation of
KATP channels, which act as metabolic sensors and homeostatic regulators of excitability in multiple
cell types (Nichols, 2006). STN neurons abundantly express all the molecular components of KATP
channels including the Kir6.2 pore-forming subunit of the KATP channel (Thomzig et al., 2005) and
the SUR1, SUR2A and SUR2B regulatory subunits (Karschin et al., 1997; Zhou et al., 2012). To
determine whether KATP channels are responsible for impaired firing in BACHD mice, the effects of
the KATP channel inhibitor glibenclamide (100 nM) on WT and phenotypic BACHD autonomous firing
ex vivo were compared. Glibenclamide application increased both the rate (BACHD control: 5.7
[1.4–9.1] Hz; BACHD glibenclamide: 11.3 [9.2–13.3] Hz; n = 15; p = 0.0003) and regularity (BACHD

0.3750; Figure 5C,D).
Glibenclamide can also activate Epac2 and Rap1 (Zhang et al., 2009), which could rescue firing
through a pathway that is independent of KATP channel inhibition. Therefore, gliclazide, a sulfonyl-
urea that has no effect on Epac2/Rap1 signaling (Zhang et al., 2009; Takahashi et al., 2015), was
applied to STN neurons of 5–7-month-old BACHD mice (Figure 6). In loose-seal, cell-attached
recordings gliclazide (10 mM) increased both firing rate (control: 5.1 [2.0–8.0] Hz; gliclazide: 9.9 [4.6–
13.8] Hz; n = 6; p = 0.0313; Figure 6) and regularity (control CV: 0.54 [0.31–0.88]; gliclazide CV: 0.29
[0.10–0.47]; n = 6; p = 0.0313; Figure 6) in phenotypic BACHD STN neurons. Together, these data
argue that KATP channels are responsible for the impaired autonomous activity of STN neurons in the
BACHD model.
As described above, 3–5 hr NMDAR antagonism with D-AP5 partially rescued autonomous activ-
ity in BACHD STN neurons. To determine whether this rescue was mediated through effects on KATP
channels, glibenclamide was applied following this treatment. D-AP5 pre-treatment partially
occluded the increases in the autonomous firing rate (BACHD glibenclamide D frequency: 4.3 [2.2–
8.7] Hz, n = 15; D-AP5 pre-treated BACHD glibenclamide D frequency: 1.9 [0.7–3.2] Hz, n = 6; p =
0.0365) and regularity (BACHD glibenclamide D CV: �0.25 [�0.85– �0.13], n = 14; D-AP5 pre-
treated BACHD glibenclamide D CV: �0.09 [�0.10– �0.03], n = 6; p = 0.0154) that accompany KATP
channel inhibition. Thus, these observations are consistent with the conclusion that prolonged
NMDAR antagonism partially rescued autonomous activity in BACHD STN neurons through a reduc-
tion in KATP channel-mediated firing disruption.
NMDAR activation produces a persistent KATP channel-mediated
disruption of autonomous activity in WT STN neurons
To further examine whether elevated NMDAR activation can trigger a homeostatic KATP channel-
mediated reduction in autonomous firing in WT STN, brain slices from 2-month-old C57BL/6 mice
were incubated in control media or media containing 25 mM NMDA for 1 hr prior to recording (Fig-
ure 7). NMDA pre-treatment reduced the proportion of autonomously firing neurons (untreated: 66/
75 (88%); NMDA: 65/87 (75%); p = 0.0444) and the frequency (untreated: 14.9 [7.8–24.8] Hz; n = 75;

rons from NMDA pre-treated slices glibenclamide application elevated firing rate (control: 3.3 [2.3–

levels similar to that seen in untreated slices. Together, these data demonstrate that increased acti-
vation of STN NMDARs can lead to a persistent KATP channel-mediated homeostatic reduction in
autonomous activity in STN neurons.

 Break down of H2O2 rescues the firing of BACHD STN neurons to WT
levels
Mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation generates superoxide, which may be dismuted by superox-
ide dismutase to produce H2O2 (Adam-Vizi, 2005). Superoxide and hydrogen peroxide can also be
produced by NADPH oxidase (Brennan et al., 2009). Because KATP channels are activated by H2O2
(Ichinari et al., 1996; Avshalumov et al., 2005), we tested whether H2O2 contributes to KATP chan-
nel-mediated disruption of ex vivo autonomous activity in the BACHD model. The effect of a mem-
brane permeable form of the enzyme catalase (polyethylene glycol-catalase), which breaks down
H2O2, on the autonomous firing of STN neurons from 4–6-month-old BACHD mice was examined
(Figure 8). Application of 250 U/ml catalase increased the rate (BACHD control: 3.4 [0.7–5.5] Hz;
BACHD catalase: 10.8 [7.6–13.8] Hz; n = 11; ph = 0.0080; Figure 8A–C) and regularity (BACHD con-
trol CV: 1.0 [0.3–2.1]; BACHD catalase CV: 0.17 [0.12–0.21]; n = 11; ph = 0.0060; Figure 8A–C) of
autonomous firing. Subsequent application of glibenclamide (100 nM) had no additional effect on fir-
ing rate (11.8 [8.2–14.4] Hz; n = 11; ph = 0.9658) or regularity (CV: 0.15 [0.12–0.23]; n = 11; ph =
0.4922; Figure 8A–C). Thus, these results suggest that H2O2 underlies KATP channel activation in
BACHD STN neurons.
To test if the actions of H2O2 on autonomous firing are confined to its effects on KATP channels,
these experiments were repeated in the presence of glibenclamide. As seen previously, application
of glibenclamide increased firing rate (BACHD control: 5.2 [1.0–6.7] Hz; BACHD glibenclamide: 8.5
[7.2–11.6] Hz; n = 8, ph = 0.0156; Figure 8D) and regularity (BACHD control CV: 0.83 [0.27–1.30];
BACHD glibenclamide CV: 0.23 [0.15–0.58]; n = 8; ph = 0.0156; Figure 8D). Subsequent application
of catalase had no additional effect on firing rate (8.7 [7.2–14.1] Hz; n = 8; ph = 0.6406; Figure 8D)
but did produce a small but statistically significant increase in regularity (CV: 0.14 [0.11–0.21]; n = 8;
ph = 0.0156; Figure 8D). In WT mice, catalase application did not change firing rate (WT control:
11.0 [10.5–14.2] Hz; WT catalase: 14.3 [11.3–18.3] Hz; n = 7; p = 0.0781; Figure 9) but lead to a
small but statistically significant increase in regularity (WT control CV: 0.12 [0.10–0.23]; WT catalase
CV: 0.11 [0.07–0.13]; n = 7; p = 0.0469; Figure 9). The effects of catalase on the frequency and regu-
larity of firing in BACHD mice were greater than those observed in WT mice (frequency: p = 0.0154;
CV: p = 0.0007; Figure 9). Together, these data suggest that suppression of autonomous activity of
STN neurons in BACHD mice is largely mediated by the modulatory effect of H2O2 on KATP
channels.
To test if the elevation of oxidant stress can result in KATP channel activation in WT STN neurons,
glutathione peroxidase was inhibited with mercaptosuccinic acid (MCS) (Avshalumov et al., 2005).
Following the application of 1 mM MCS both the rate (control: 12.0 [7.8–13.5] Hz; MCS: 9.0 [4.8–
10.5] Hz; n = 11; ph = 0.0068; Figure 10) and regularity (control CV: 0.21 [0.15–0.22]; MCS CV: 0.30
[0.22–0.34]; n = 11; ph = 0.0137) of firing decreased. Subsequent application of glibenclamide res-
cued both firing rate (14.6 [10.3–19.2] Hz; n = 11; ph = 0.0020) and regularity (CV: 0.12 [0.12–0.17];
n = 11; ph = 0.0098; Figure 10). These data are also consistent with an action of H2O2 on STN KATP
channels.
The STN degenerates progressively in BACHD mice
HD patients exhibit 20–30% STN neuron loss (Lange et al., 1976; Guo et al., 2012). Because mito-
chondrial oxidant stress and reactive oxygen species can trigger apoptotic pathways leading to cell
death (Green and Reed, 1998;
Bossy-Wetzel et al., 2008), the number of STN neurons in 12-
month-old BACHD and WT mice were compared (Figure 11). The brains of BACHD mice and WT lit-
termates were first fixed by transcardial perfusion of formaldehyde, sectioned into 70 mm coronal sli-
ces and immunohistochemically labeled for neuronal nuclear protein (NeuN). The total number of
NeuN-immunoreactive STN neurons and the volume of the STN were then estimated using unbiased
stereological techniques. Both the total number of STN neurons (WT: 10,793 [9,070–11,545]; n = 7;
BACHD: 7,307 [7,047–9,285]; n = 7; p = 0.0262) and the volume of the STN (WT: 0.087 [0.084–
0.095] mm3; n = 7; BACHD: 0.078 [0.059–0.081] mm3; n = 7; p = 0.0111;
Figure 11A,B) were
reduced in 12-month-old BACHD versus WT mice. The density of STN neurons was not different in
BACHD and WT mice (WT: 121,248 [107,180–126,139] neurons/mm3; n = 7; BACHD: 115,273
[90,377–135,765] neurons/mm3; n = 7; p = 0.8048; Figure 11A,B). To determine whether the differ-
ence in cell number represents an early developmental abnormality or a progressive loss of adult

 neurons, the numbers of neurons in 2-month-old BACHD and WT mice were also compared. At 2-
months-old, the total number of STN neurons (WT: 10,373 [9,341–14,414]; n = 7; BACHD: 10,638
[10,513–13,877]; n = 7; p = 0.7104; Figure 11C), the volume of the STN (WT: 0.098 [0.090–0.125]
mm3; n = 7; BACHD: 0.085 [0.080–0.111] mm3; n = 7; p = 0.1649; Figure 11C) and STN neuronal
density (106,880 [98,100–115,985] neurons/mm3; n = 7; BACHD: 124,844 [115,479–145,711] neu-
rons/mm3; n = 7; p = 0.1282; Figure 11C) were not different in WT and BACHD mice. Together,
these data demonstrate that between the ages of 2 months and 12 months BACHD mice lose
approximately one third of their STN neurons compared to WT littermates.

 The STN of Q175 KI mice exhibits similar abnormalities to those
observed in the BACHD model
STN neurons from BACHD mice exhibit perturbed autonomous firing that is caused by NMDAR acti-
vation/signaling leading to mitochondrial oxidant stress, H2O2 generation and KATP channel activa-
tion. Furthermore, STN neurons are progressively lost in BACHD mice. To determine whether these
features are specific to the BACHD model or a more general feature of HD models, a subset of
experiments were repeated in heterozygous Q175 KI mice (Figure 12). STN neurons from 6-month-
old Q175 mice exhibited a severely reduced rate of autonomous activity (WT: 7.8 [1.9–14.7] Hz; n =
90; Q175: 0.0 [0.0–6.3] Hz; n = 90; p < 0.0001; Figure 12A,B), though the regularity of active neu-
rons was unchanged (WT CV: 0.2 [0.1–0.6]; n = 77; Q175 CV: 0.4 [0.1–1.0]; n = 42; p = 0.1506; Fig-
ure 12A,B). Additionally, there was a large decrease in the proportion of active neurons in the Q175
STN (WT: 77/90 (86%); Q175: 42/90 (47%); p < 0.0001).
Inhibition of KATP channels with glibenclamide rescued both STN firing rate and regularity in
Q175 and increased regularity only in WT (WT control frequency: 9.7 [5.4–13.5] Hz; WT glibencla-
mide frequency: 10.3 [7.4–15.4] Hz; n = 8; p = 0.1094; Q175 control frequency: 4.8 [3.5–6.2] Hz;
Q175 glibenclamide frequency: 11.0 [9.3–13.6] Hz; n = 6; p = 0.0313; WT control CV: 0.19 [0.13–
0.47]; WT glibenclamide CV: 0.11 [0.10–0.21]; n = 8; p = 0.0078; Q175 control CV: 0.45 [0.35–0.71];
Q175 glibenclamide CV: 0.15 [0.10–0.17]; n = 6; p = 0.03125; Figure 12C,D). Similar to BACHD,
Q175 STN neurons recovered to WT-like firing rate following >3 hr pretreatment with D-AP5 (Q175
control: 4.6 [0.0–11.4] Hz; n = 45; Q175 D-AP5 treated: 11.6 [0.0–18.7] Hz; n = 45; p = 0.0144; Fig-
ure 12E,F), although the regularity (Q175 control CV: 0.16 [0.10–0.66]; n = 15; Q175 D-AP5 treated
CV: 0.14 [0.09–0.32]; n = 12; p = 0.2884;

control: 30/45 (67%); Q175 D-AP5 treated: 33/45 (73%); p = 0.6460; Figure 12E,F) were unaltered.
The 12-month-old Q175 STN (n = 7) exhibited a median 26% reduction in the total number of STN
neurons with no effect on other parameters (WT: 8,661 [7,120–9,376] neurons; Q175: 6,420 [5,792–

 [63,624–103,020] neurons/mm3; p = 0.2086; Figure 12G,H). Taken together, these data show that
the STN exhibits similar dysfunction and neuronal loss in both the transgenic BACHD and Q175 KI
mouse models of HD.
Discussion
Dysfunction of the striatum and cortex has been extensively characterized in HD models, but rela-
tively few studies have examined the extra-striatal basal ganglia. Here, we report early NMDAR,
mitochondrial and firing abnormalities together with progressive loss of STN neurons in two HD
mouse models. Furthermore, dysfunction was present in HD mice prior to the onset of major symp-
toms, implying that it occurs early in the disease process (Gray et al., 2008; Menalled et al., 2012).
Cell death in the STN also preceded that in the striatum, as STN neuronal loss was observed at 12
months of age in both BACHD and Q175 mice, a time point at which striatal neuronal loss is absent
but psychomotor dysfunction is manifest (Gray et al., 2008; Heikkinen et al., 2012; Smith et al.,
2014; Mantovani et al., 2016). Together these findings argue that dysfunction within the STN con-
tributes to the pathogenesis of HD.
Astrocytes appear to play a pivotal role in HD. Expression of mutant huntingtin in astrocytes
alone is sufficient to recapitulate neuronal and neurological abnormalities observed in HD and its
models (Bradford et al., 2009; Faideau et al., 2010). Furthermore, astrocyte-specific rescue
approaches ameliorate some of the abnormalities observed in HD models (Tong et al., 2014;
Oliveira et al., 2016). In the STN, inhibition of GLT-1 (and GLAST) slowed individual NMDAR EPSCs
in WT but not BACHD mice and eliminated the differences in their decay kinetics, arguing that
impaired uptake of glutamate by astrocytes contributed to the relative prolongation of NMDAR-
mediated
EPSCs

BACHD
STN
neurons.
Interestingly,
and

contrast
to
the
striatum
(Milnerwood et al., 2010), when spillover of glutamate onto extrasynaptic receptors was increased
by train stimulation and inhibition of astrocytic glutamate uptake, the resulting compound NMDAR
EPSC and its prolongation by uptake inhibition were similar in BACHD and WT mice, arguing against

 were observed here are sufficient to promote NMDAR-mediated dysfunction in HD STN neurons
remains to be determined.
NMDARs play a key role in the abnormal activity of STN neurons in HD models. Antagonism of
STN NMDARs in BACHD and Q175 brain slices rescued autonomous STN firing. Conversely, acute
activation of STN NMDARs persistently disrupted STN firing in WT brain slices. If the relatively low
level of glutamatergic transmission present ex vivo is sufficient to impair firing then this impairment
is likely to be more severe in vivo where STN neurons are powerfully patterned by glutamatergic
transmission arising from the cortex, thalamus, pedunculopontine nucleus and superior colliculus
(reviewed by Bevan, 2017). Non-synaptic sources of extracellular glutamate, such as diffusion/
release from astrocytes (Cavelier and Attwell, 2005; Lee et al., 2013) may also contribute to exces-
sive NMDAR activation in HD mice.
Extended antagonism of NMDARs in BACHD slices also reduced mitochondrial oxidant stress in
STN neurons. NMDAR activation can elevate ROS through a variety of Ca2+- and nitric oxide-associ-
ated signaling pathways and their actions on mitochondria, NADPH oxidase and antioxidant expres-
sion (Dugan et al., 1995;
Moncada and Bolan
˜os, 2006; Brennan et al., 2009; Nakamura and
Lipton, 2011; Valencia et al., 2013). Although we saw no evidence of basal mitochondrial dysfunc-
tion that was not attributable to increased NMDAR function, there is considerable evidence that
mutant huntingtin causes transcriptional dysregulation, which leads to defective mitochondrial qual-
ity control, an increase in the proportion of defective, ROS generating mitochondria and an increase
in opening of the permeability transition pore (Milakovic and Johnson, 2005; Panov et al., 2002;
Fernandes et al., 2007; Song et al., 2011; Chaturvedi et al., 2013; Johri et al., 2013;
Martin et al., 2015). Thus, basal mitochondrial dysfunction could render HD STN neurons especially
sensitive to NMDAR-mediated transmission and signaling.
Catalase rapidly restored autonomous firing in the BACHD model, an effect occluded by inhibi-
tion of KATP channels, arguing that H2O2, through its action on KATP channels is the major cause of
firing
disruption.

(Ichinari et al., 1996), reducing the ratio of ATP to ADP (Krippeit-Drews et al., 1999), and/or mod-
ulating channel gating through a sGC-cGMP-PKG-ROS(H2O2)-ERK1/2-calmodulin-CaMKII signaling
pathway (Zhang et al., 2014). H2O2 is likely to directly modulate STN KATP channels in HD mice
because disrupted firing was also observed when STN neurons were recorded in the whole-cell con-
figuration with patch pipettes containing exogenous ATP. Furthermore, H2O2 break down rapidly
rescued activity, consistent with a direct action on KATP channels. H2O2-dependent modulation of
KATP channels has been extensively characterized in midbrain dopamine neurons where it powerfully
suppresses cellular excitability and synaptic transmission (Avshalumov et al., 2005; Bao et al.,
2009). The activation of KATP channels in STN neurons may represent a form of homeostasis that
suppresses firing when mitochondrial oxidant stress is high, limiting the possibility of oxidant dam-
age and bioenergetic failure (Ray et al., 2012; Sena and Chandel, 2012).

Neuroscience
 In HD, chronic oxidant stress can lead to damage, such as lipid and protein peroxidation and
nuclear/mitochondrial DNA damage, which profoundly impair cellular function and promote cell
death (Perluigi et al., 2005; Browne and Beal, 2006; Acevedo-Torres et al., 2009). Consistent
with the negative effects of such processes on neuronal viability, we observed progressive loss of
STN neurons in both the BACHD and Q175 models. Furthermore, the level of neuronal loss at 12
months in the BACHD and Q175 models was similar to that observed in HD patients (Lange et al.,
1976; Guo et al., 2012). The absence of neuronal loss in the cortex and striatum in the same models
at an equivalent time point suggests that STN dysfunction and degeneration may be particularly
influential in the early disease process. Although the STN is known to degenerate in HD, it is not
clear why neuronal loss is ultimately less than that observed in the striatum at the end stage of the
disease, despite the fact that dysfunction and degeneration occur earlier (at least in HD models).
Future research will be required to determine whether subtypes of STN neurons exhibit selective vul-
nerability and/or whether the processes promoting their degeneration, e.g. cortical activation of
STN NMDARs, ultimately wane.
As a key component of the hyperdirect and indirect pathways, the STN is critical for constraining
cortico-striatal activity underlying action selection (Albin et al., 1989; Oldenburg and Sabatini,
2015). In the ‘classical’ model of basal ganglia function, degeneration of indirect pathway striatal
projection neurons is proposed to underlie the symptoms of early stage HD (Albin et al., 1989).
Here we show for the first time that STN dysfunction and neuronal loss precede cortico-striatal
abnormalities in HD models. Thus, dysfunction and degeneration of cortical and striatal neurons
occurs in concert with profound changes in other elements of the basal ganglia. Therapeutic strate-
gies that target the STN may therefore be useful not only for treating the psychomotor symptoms of
early- to mid-stage HD but also for influencing dysfunction and degeneration throughout the cor-
tico-basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical circuit.
Materials and methods
Animals
All animal procedures were performed in accordance with the policies of the Society for Neurosci-
ence and the National Institutes of Health, and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee of Northwestern University. Adult male hemizygous BACHD mice (RRID:IMSR_JAX:
008197) and heterozygous Q175 mice (RRID:IMSR_JAX:027410), their WT litter mates, and C57BL/6
mice (Charles River Laboratories International, Inc., Wilmington, MA, USA) were used in this study.
Stereotaxic injection of viral vectors
Mice were anesthetized with 1–2% isoflurane (Smiths Medical ASD, Inc., Dublin, OH, USA). AAV vec-
tors (serotype 9; ~1012–13 GC/ml) engineered to express hChR2(H134R)-eYFP under the hSyn pro-
moter (University of Pennsylvania Vector Core, Philadelphia, PA, USA) or MTS-roGFP under the CMV
promoter (Sanchez-Padilla et al., 2014) were injected under stereotaxic guidance (Neurostar, Tubin-
gen, Germany). In order to express hChR2(H134R)-eYFP, AAV was injected bilaterally into the pri-
mary motor cortex (three injections per hemisphere; coordinates relative to bregma: AP, +0.6 mm,
+ 1.2 mm, and +1.8 mm; ML, + 1.5 mm, and �1.5 mm; DV, �1.0 mm; 0.3 ml per injection). In order
to express MTS-roGFP, AAV was injected bilaterally into the STN (coordinates: AP, �2.06 mm;
ML, +1.4 mm, and �1.4 mm; DV, �4.5 mm; 0.4 ml per injection). Brain slices were prepared from
AAV-injected mice 10–14 days after injection.
Slice preparation
Mice were lightly anesthetized with isoflurane, deeply anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine (87/13
mg/kg i.p.) and then perfused transcardially with ~10 ml of ice-cold sucrose-based artificial cerebro-
spinal fluid (sACSF) that contained 230 mM sucrose, 2.5 mM KCl, 1.25 mM NaH2PO4, 0.5 mM CaCl2,
10 mM MgSO4, 10 mM glucose, and 26 mM NaHCO3 equilibrated with 95% O2 and 5% CO2. The
brain was removed, immersed in sASCF and 250 mm sagittal slices were cut with a vibratome
(VT1200S; Leica Microsystems Inc., IL, USA). Slices were then transferred to a holding chamber,
immersed in ACSF that contained 125 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl, 1.25 mM NaH2PO4, 2 mM CaCl2, 2
mM MgSO4, 10 mM glucose, 26 mM NaHCO3, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, and 5 mM L-glutathione

 equilibrated with 95% O2 and 5% CO2, held at 35˚C for 30–45 min, then maintained at room
temperature.
Recording
Individual brain slices were placed in a recording chamber where they were perfused at 4–5 ml/min
with synthetic interstitial fluid (SIF) at 35˚C that contained 126 mM NaCl, 3 mM KCl, 1.25 mM
NaH2PO4, 1.6 mM CaCl2, 1.5 mM MgSO4, 10 mM glucose and 26 mM NaHCO3 equilibrated with
95% O2 and 5% CO2. Somatic recordings were obtained under visual guidance (Axioskop FS2, Carl
Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) using computer-controlled manipulators (Luigs and Neumann, Ratin-
gen, Germany). Loose-seal cell-attached recordings were made using 3–5 MW impedance borosili-
cate glass pipettes (Warner Instruments, Hamden, CT, USA) that were filled with 140 mM NaCl, 23
mM glucose, 15 mM HEPES, 3 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 1.6 mM CaCl2 (pH 7.2 with NaOH, 300–310
mOsm/l). Whole-cell voltage clamp recordings were made using 3–5 MW pipettes filled with 135
mM CsCH3O3S, 10 mM QX-314, 10 mM HEPES, 5 mM phosphocreatine, 3.8 mM NaCl, 2 mM
Mg1.5ATP, 1 mM MgCl2, 0.4 mM Na3GTP, 0.1 mM Na4EGTA (pH 7.2 with CsOH, 290 mOsm/l).
Whole-cell current clamp recordings were made using 10–15 MW pipettes filled with 130 mM
KCH3SO4, 3.8 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 10 mM HEPES, 5 mM phosphocreatine di(tris) salt, 0.1 mM
Na4EGTA, 0.4 mM Na3GTP, and 2 mM Mg1.5ATP (pH 7.3 with KOH; 290 mOsm/l). Electrophysiolog-
ical records were acquired using a computer running Clampex 10 software (Molecular Devices, Palo
Alto, CA, USA; RRID:SCR_011323) connected to a Multiclamp 700B amplifier (Molecular Devices) via
a Digidata 1322 A digitizer (Molecular Devices). Data were low-pass filtered at 10 kHz and sampled
at 50 kHz. Liquid junction potentials of 10 and 9 mV were accounted for in whole-cell voltage clamp
and current clamp recordings respectively, and in voltage clamp recordings series resistance and
membrane capacitance were corrected online. All recordings of autonomous action potential gener-
ation were made in the acute presence of 50 mM D-AP5, 20 mM DNQX, 10 mM GABAzine, and 2 mM
CGP 55845 to block synaptic transmission.
Two-photon imaging
MTS-roGFP-expressing neurons were imaged at 890 nm with 76 MHz pulse repetition and ~250 fs
pulse duration at the sample plane. Two-photon excitation was provided by a G8 OPSL pumped
Mira 900 F laser (Coherent, Santa Clara, CA, USA) and sample power was regulated by a Pockels
cell electro-optic modulator (model M350-50-02-BK, Con Optics, Danbury, CT, USA). Images were
acquired using an Ultima 2 P system running PrairieView 5 (Bruker Nano Fluorescence Microscopy,
Middleton, WI, USA) and a BX51WI microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) with a 60 � 0.9 NA objec-
tive (UIS1 LUMPFL; Olympus). After baseline fluorescence had been measured, the maximum and
minimum fluorescence were determined by the application of 2 mM dithiothreitol and then 200 mM
aldrithiol-4 to fully reduce and oxidize the tissue, respectively. The relative oxidation at baseline, a
measure of oxidative stress, was then calculated (Sanchez-Padilla et al., 2014).
Immunohistochemistry and stereology
Mice were lightly anesthetized with isoflurane, deeply anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine (87/13
mg/kg i.p.) and then perfused transcardially with ~5 ml of phosphate buffered saline (PBS) followed
by 30 ml of 4% formaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). Brains were removed and post-
fixed for 2 hr in 4% formaldehyde, then washed in PBS. Brains were blocked and 70 mm thick coronal
sections containing the STN were cut using a vibratome (VT1000S; Leica). Sections were washed in
PBS and incubated for 48 hr at 4˚C in anti-NeuN (clone A60; MilliporeSigma, Darmstadt, Germany;
RRID:AB_2298772) at 1:200 in PBS with 0.2% Triton X-100 (MilliporeSigma) and 2% normal donkey
serum. Sections were then washed in PBS and incubated for 90 min at room temperature in Alexa
Fluor 488 donkey anti-mouse IgG (1:250; Jackson Immunoresearch, West Grove, PA, USA; RRID:AB_
2340846) in 0.2% Triton X-100 and 2% normal donkey serum. Then the sections were washed in PBS
and mounted on glass slides in Prolong Gold anti-fade medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham,
MA, USA).
NeuN labeled sections were imaged using an Axioskop two microscope (Carl Zeiss) with a 100 �
1.3 NA oil immersion objective (Plan-Neofluar 1018–595; Carl Zeiss). Unbiased stereological count-
ing of STN neurons in a single hemisphere was performed using the optical fractionator technique

 (West et al., 1991) as implemented in Stereo Investigator (MBF Bioscience, Williston, VT, USA;
RRID:SCR_002526), using a counting frame of 50 mm � 50 mm � 8 mm and a grid size of 150 mm �
150 mm; all sections containing the STN were used for counting (~8 sections). STN volume was calcu-
lated from the sum of the areal extent of the STN on each section multiplied by the section thickness
(70 mm). For all individual counts the Gundersen Coefficient of Error (CE) (Gundersen et al., 1999)
was less than 0.1 (0.080 [0.075–0.090]), and the investigator performing the counting was blinded to
the genotype of the mouse.
Drugs
All drugs used in electrophysiology and imaging experiments were diluted to working concentration
in SIF and bath applied. D-AP5, CGP 55845, DNQX, GABAzine (SR 95531), NMDA and gliclazide
were purchased from Abcam (Cambridge, MA, USA). Glibenclamide, TFB-TBOA and DL-Dithiothrei-
tol were purchased from Tocris Bioscience (Bristol, UK). Catalase (polyethylene glycol-catalase), aldri-
thiol-4 and MCS were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA).
Data analysis and statistics
Electrophysiological data were analyzed using routines running in Igor Pro 6 and 7 (Wavemetrics,
Portland, OR, USA; RRID:SCR_000325) or matplotlib (Hunter, 2007; RRID:SCR_008624). The firing
rate of STN neurons was calculated from 1 min of recording or 100 action potentials (whichever cov-
ered the longer time period). Imaging data were analyzed using FIJI (Schindelin et al., 2012; RRID:
SCR_002285). Statistical analyses were performed in Prism 5 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA,
USA; RRID:SCR_002798) or R (http://www.r-project.org/; RRID:SCR_001905, RRID:SCR_000432). In
order to make no assumptions about the distribution of the data, non-parametric statistical tests
were used, and data are reported as median [interquartile range]; outliers were not excluded from
the analysis. An a-level of 0.05 was used for two-way statistical comparisons performed with the
Mann-Whitney U test for unpaired data (represented with box plots), the Wilcoxon signed rank test
for paired data (tilted line segment plots), Fisher’s exact test for categorical data (bar plots) or the
F-test for linear regression. Where datasets were used in multiple comparisons the p-value was
adjusted to maintain the family-wise error rate at 0.05 using the Holm-Bonferroni method
(Holm, 1979); adjusted p-values are denoted ph. Box plots show median (central line), interquartile
range (box) and 10–90% range (whiskers). For the primary findings reported in the manuscript, sam-
ple sizes for Mann-Whitney and Wilcoxon tests were estimated to achieve a minimum of 80% power
using formulae described by Noether (1987). The effect sizes used in these power calculations were
estimated using data randomly drawn from uniform distributions (runif() function in R stats package).
For Mann-Whitney tests, with a 50 percentile change in median between groups X and Y (the inter-
quartile ranges of the groups don’t overlap) P(Y > X) » 0.88 giving an estimation that at least 10
observations per group would be needed to achieve 80% power; for a 25 percentile change (the
median of Y falls outside the interquartile range of X) P(Y > X) » 0.72 and the estimated requirement
is at least 27 observations per group. For Wilcoxon tests, if all pairs of observations show the same
direction of change, P(X + X’ > 0)= 1 giving an estimation that at least 10 observations would be
needed to achieve 80% power (note though that it is possible to show empirically that 6 observa-
tions gives 100% power in this case); if 90% of observations show the same direction of change, P(X
+ X’ > 0) » 0.98 and the estimated requirement is at least 12 pairs of observations.
