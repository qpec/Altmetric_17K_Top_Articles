Against Children: A Systematic 
Review and Minimum Estimates

abstract
CONTEXT: Evidence confirms associations between childhood violence and major causes of 
mortality in adulthood. A synthesis of data on past-year prevalence of violence against 
children will help advance the United Nations’ call to end all violence against children.
OBJECTIVES: Investigators systematically reviewed population-based surveys on the 
prevalence of past-year violence against children and synthesized the best available 
evidence to generate minimum regional and global estimates.
DATA SOURCES: We searched Medline, PubMed, Global Health, NBASE, CINAHL, and the World 
Wide Web for reports of representative surveys estimating prevalences of violence against 
children.
STUDY SELECTION: Two investigators independently assessed surveys against inclusion criteria 
and rated those included on indicators of quality.
DATA EXTRACTION: Investigators extracted data on past-year prevalences of violent victimization 
by country, age group, and type (physical, sexual, emotional, or multiple types). We used a 
triangulation approach which synthesized data to generate minimum regional prevalences, 
derived from population-weighted averages of the country-specific prevalences.
RESULTS: Thirty-eight reports provided quality data for 96 countries on past-year prevalences 
of violence against children. Base case estimates showed a minimum of 50% or more of 
children in Asia, Africa, and Northern America experienced past-year violence, and that 
globally over half of all children—1 billion children, ages 2–17 years—experienced such 
violence.
LIMITATIONS: Due to variations in timing and types of violence reported, triangulation could 
only be used to generate minimum prevalence estimates.
CONCLUSIONS: Expanded population-based surveillance of violence against children is essential 
to target prevention and drive the urgent investment in action endorsed in the United 
Nations 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda.

Violence against children is a public 
health, human rights, and social 
problem, with potentially devastating 
and costly consequences.1 Its 
destructive effects harm children in 
every country, impacting families, 
communities, and nations, and 
reaching across generations. 
Recognizing its pervasive and unjust 
nature, almost all nations (196) 
ratified the 1989 United Nations (UN) 
Convention on the Rights of the Child, 
which recognizes freedom from 
violence as a fundamental human 
right of children. Now, over 25 years 
later, the UN has launched a new 
Agenda for Sustainable Development 
to end all forms of violence 
against children.2 Documenting 
the magnitude of violence against 
children by synthesizing the best 
available evidence will be essential 
for informing policy, driving action, 
and monitoring progress for this bold 
agenda.
Data from surveys on violence 
against children in different countries 
typically measure prevalences of 
individual types of violence, such 
as physical, sexual, or emotional 
violence. Alternatively, estimates 
may focus on 1 location or class 
of perpetrator; examples include 
bullying victimization, which 
is often only measured when it 
occurs on school grounds, or child 
maltreatment, which is limited to that 
perpetrated by parents or caregivers. 
Rarely do prevalence studies 
measure ranges of types, locations, 
and perpetrators.
Although few studies assess 
experiences of childhood violence 
across types, many reports suggest 
differing types share similar 
consequences.3 Such consequences 
are additive, increasing with 
increases in types and severity 
of violence experience.3,4 These 
harmful sequelae span major causes 
of death in adulthood, including 
noncommunicable diseases, injury, 
HIV, mental health problems, suicide, 
and reproductive health problems.3–6
Empirical associations between 
early exposure to violence and major 
causes of mortality in adulthood 
were recognized years ago, before 
elucidation of their shared biological 
underpinnings.3,4,7 Recent evidence 
documents the biology of violence, 
demonstrating that traumatic stress 
experienced in response to violence 
may impair brain architecture, 
immune status, metabolic systems, 
and inflammatory responses.4 Early 
experiences of violence may confer 
lasting damage at the basic levels 
of nervous, endocrine, and immune 
systems, and can even influence 
genetic alteration of DNA.4,7
In response to increasing recognition 
of the magnitude, consequences, 
biology, and costs of violence 
against children, there are growing 
commitments by UN agencies, 
the World Health Organization, 
the Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention, USAID, PEPFAR, 
World Bank, Together for Girls, 
governments, academic centers, 
and civil society organizations, 
to its prevention. The converging 
prioritization of protecting children 
from violence has culminated in the 
inclusion of not just 1, but 2 zero-
based targets—outcomes that every 
country should seek to eliminate, 
rather than merely reduce—in the 
sustainable development goals 
(SDGs): to “end abuse, exploitation, 
trafficking, and all forms of violence 
against children,” and to “eliminate 
all forms of violence against women 
and girls.”2 Many countries lack the 
data that will be needed to evaluate 
progress from 2016 to 2030 toward 
these targets.
After years of research addressing 
magnitude, risk factors, and 
consequences of violence against 
children, a consensus is emerging 
on how to reliably measure its 
prevalence. Because violence against 
children does not typically come 
to the attention of official agencies, 
global evidence reveals that the self-
reported prevalence of child sexual 
abuse victimization is >30 times 
higher than official reports,8 and self-
reported physical abuse victimization 
is >75 times higher.9 Thus, self-
reports are now considered an 
essential measurement tool and 
will be foundational for informing 
new investment opportunities 
associated with the SDG aims to end 
violence against children. These 
self-reports should be ascertained 
after informed assent/consent is 
given and in private, where children 
and/or caretakers can provide 
direct information about exposures 
to violent behaviors across types, 
locations, and perpetrators.
In recent years, the number of 
representative surveys addressing 
prevalences of recent experiences 
of violence against children has 
increased. Two of these, the National 
Survey of Children’s Exposure to 
Violence (NatSCEV) and Violence 
Against Children Surveys (VACS), 
measure the full range of types, 
locations, and perpetrators; and 
several others, such as Multiple 
Indicator Surveys (MICS), WorldSafe, 
Health Behavior in School-Aged 
Children Surveys (HBSC), and Global 
School Health Surveys (GSHS), 
provide estimates of exposures to 
several types of violence, though 
these estimates are restricted to 1 
class of perpetrator or location.10–15
Given the new global prioritization 
of the prevention of violence against 
children, it is important to use the 
best available evidence to assess the 
extent to which children in various 
regions of the world are exposed 
to it. Our aims are to systematically 
review the quality of population-
based evidence on prevalence of 
violence against children during 
the past year, and then to use 
a triangulation approach that 
synthesizes data from high quality 
surveys to estimate global minimum 
prevalences and numbers of children 
exposed to violence during the past 
year. We conclude by describing the 
urgent need to implement effective,

METHODS
Systematic Review: Approach, 
Characteristics, Quality, and Data 
Abstraction
We used the PRISMA statement 
to guide our systematic review.16 
Our database search, conducted 
in January 2014 by using Medline, 
PubMed, Global Health, NBASE, and 
CINAHL, identified 907 unduplicated 
peer-reviewed reports published 
after the year 2000, by using these 
search terms: [(low-income countries 
or middle-income countries or high-
income countries or developing 
countries or developed countries) 
and (ages 1 to 18 years or children or 
adolescents or infants or preschool 
child or school child) and (national 
surveys or population surveillance 
or health survey or surveys or 
disease surveys or epidemiologic 
surveys or surveillance), and (child 
maltreatment or physical violence or 
sexual violence or emotional violence 
or maltreatment or neglect or bully 
or bullying or bullies or bullied)] (see 
Supplemental Material). We extended 
our search from January 2014 to 
August 2015 (see Supplemental 
Material) and identified an additional 
22 published reports (Supplemental 
Material), including both peer-
reviewed papers and reports from 
the UNICEF MICS (reports from 
33 countries), VACS (reports for 8 
countries), and HBSC (reports for 
37 countries). After screening a 
total of 929 unduplicated reports 
for descriptions of population-based 
measures of any type of past-year 
violence against children in the 0 to 
17 year age range, we conducted a 
full review on 54 reports. Of these, 
16 reports were excluded due to: 
no report of past-year prevalence,6 
report of perpetration only,1 
subjective definition of exposure,2 
nonprobabilistic sampling,5 and 
provision of only qualitative data2 
(Fig 1). The final 38 reports provided 
quantitative estimates of prevalence 
of 1 or more types of violence 
against children occurring during the 
previous year.1710–15,18–48
These 38 references met the 
following criteria for inclusion: 
(1) population-based survey data, 
probabilistically drawn, using 
national or subnational samples; (2) 
use of standard measures of violence 
that assess behaviors (Supplemental 
Table 6, Supplemental Material); 
(3) data collected by interviewer-
administered household survey, 
school survey, or random digit dialed 
telephone survey using self-report 
(by child and/or caregiver); (4) age 
of target population (2–17 years); 
(5) specification of country-specific 
or area-specific estimates; and (6) 
violence reported during 1 to 12 
months before implementation of the 
survey. To conduct the systematic 
review, 2 investigators (S.H. and 
H.K.) independently assessed 
studies against inclusion criteria 
and independently rated their 
quality for key indicators, including 
clear description of population-
based sampling, use of standard 
definitions of violent behaviors, 
preimplementation training 
of interviewers/questionnaire 
administrators, presentation of 
weighted analyses, description of 
whether survey was national or 
subnational, and participation rates 
(Table 1). Finally, the investigators 
(S.H. and H.K.) performed duplicate 
extraction of past-year prevalence 
data by age,2–16,18 country, and 
type of violent victimization as 
defined by varying investigators, 
including physical violence, moderate 
physical violence, severe physical 
violence, emotional violence, severe 
psychological (emotional) violence,

sexual violence, bullying, and physical 
dating violence (Supplemental Table 
6, Supplemental Material). Although 
our interest was experience of any 
violence, which included 1 or more 
types of victimization (physical, 
sexual, or emotional) committed by 
a range of perpetrators (authority 
figures, peers, romantic partners, 
or strangers) in various locations 
(home, school, or community), only 
VACS and NatSCEV provided such 
measures.10,11,19,26–30,38,40,41,44,47 
The MICS, however, do report “any 
violent discipline” as the perpetration 
in the home by caregivers of any of 
these categories of violent discipline: 
moderate physical and/or severe 
physical and/or psychological 
violence. For this article, we include 
MICS reports of “any violent 
discipline” in our “any violence” 
category.25
Synthesizing Estimates of Minimum 
Exposure to Past-year Violence
The final review included data from 
112 studies in 96 countries. We used 
a triangulation approach, which 
included a critical synthesis of data 
to develop minimum estimates by 
using population-weighted averages 
of regional exposures to past-
year violence.49–51 Triangulation 
is appropriate for comparing, 
contrasting, and synthesizing 
research characterized by varying 
methodologies and diverse limitation 
when the primary purpose is not 
to elucidate etiology, but rather 
to catalyze public health action.49 
Although previous reports have 
pooled data on a specific type of 
violence from a standardized survey 
(eg, GSHS), our interest in generating 
estimates of past-year experience of 
any type of violence across surveys 
made triangulation more suitable, 
due to variations in methods, 
definitions, populations, and timing 
of data collection.15,49,52 Using types 
of violence measured in various 
surveys, such as NatSCEV, MICS, 
WorldSafe, VACS, GSHS, and HBSC 
(Table 1), we abstracted past-year 
prevalences of physical violence, 
severe physical violence, sexual 
violence, emotional violence, severe 
psychological (emotional) violence, 
bullying victimization, fighting, and 
when reported, exposure to “any 
violence.” Forty-three countries 
reported exposure to “any violence” 
in the past year. MICS studies33 and 
the Canada Conflict Tactics Scale 
(CTS) adaptation1 report moderate 
physical and/or harsh physical and/
or emotional by 1 type of perpetrator 
in 1 type of location; VACS studies8 
report physical, emotional, and/or 
sexual by multiple perpetrators and 
locations; NatSCEV1 reports physical 
and/or emotional, and/or sexual 
and/or bullying and/or direct crime 
against the child, and/or witnessing 
violence by multiple perpetrators 
and locations.10–12,19,25–30,38,40,41,44,47 
Though NatSCEV includes both 
victimization and witnessing 
violence, we include only direct 
victimization data. In instances 
where the same survey had been 
implemented periodically (eg, 
NatSCEV, HBSC), we used the most 
recently published.14,47
Definitions vary on the measurement 
of exposure to any given type of 
violent victimization. Definitions 
vary particularly in whether they 
include hitting with bare hands, or 
spanking, as a form of violence. For 
example, in the WorldSafe, MICS, 
and survey adaptations using CTS, 
“moderate physical violence” includes 
“slapping, hitting with bare hands, 
hitting with an object, shaking, or 
spanking”13,25,29,35,43; in contrast, the 
NatSCEV and VACS exclude spanking 
from their measures.10,47 In light 
of these variations, we performed 
our base case analysis by using the 
conservative definition for physical 
violence which excluded spanking, 
although in so doing we also excluded 
other dimensions in the moderate 
category for violent discipline, such as 
slapping and shaking. Thus, for survey 
measures based on the experiences 
of violence in the home (MICS, 
WorldSafe, and survey adaptations 
of CTS), we used prevalences for 
severe violence (such as kicked, 
choked, smothered, burned, scaled, 
branded, beat repeatedly, or hit with 
an object) in the base case analyses to 
avoid inclusion of spanking13,25,35,39,43 
(Supplemental Table 6, Supplemental 
Material). For the sensitivity analysis, 
we expanded the classification of 
exposures to include prevalences of 
moderate physical violence or any 
violence, both of which had spanking 
as a defining indicator (Supplemental 
Material).13,25 As expected, country-
specific prevalences of violence against 
children in the base case were lower 
than those in the sensitivity analysis.
Country-specifi
 c Estimates of Violence 
Against Children
We used published prevalence 
data to generate country-specific 
estimates for 2 age groups (2–14 
and 15–17 years) of minimum 
prevalences of violence in the 
previous 12 months. Age ranges and 
types of violence reported varied 
across surveys, with most reporting 
only 1 or 2 types; additionally, 
many surveys only measured past-
month exposure. Therefore, due to 
limitations in types and timing, we 
can only characterize prevalence 
of past-year violence in terms of 
minimum exposure for children 
living in 1 of the countries with 
published data. We also excluded 
children aged 0–1 years, since few 
reports include this group.
To estimate the minimum number of 
children aged 2 to 17 years exposed 
to violence in each country, we used 
2014 US Census Bureau international 
population data to create 2 
population-at-risk age groups: 2 to 14 
and 15 to 17 years53 (Supplemental 
Material). Then, for both base case 
and sensitivity analyses, to estimate 
numbers of children in a given 
country known to be exposed, we 
applied the highest published age 
group–specific prevalence of violence 
(often only 1 type for the base case)

to the corresponding 2014 reference 
population age group for that 
country: either the 2- to 14-year-old 
or the 15- to 17-year-old population. 
Disaggregated age data were 
available for 110 of 112 abstracted 
prevalence estimates, either through 
age-related eligibility criteria for 
a given survey or through age-
stratified data for surveys including 
ages 0 to 17 years (see Supplemental 
Material for details). While reports 
measuring violent discipline (eg, 
MICS) provided most country-
specific estimates for ages 2 to 14 
years, those surveys focusing on 
adolescents, such as VACS, GSHS, and 
HBSC provided most data for the 15- 
to 17-year-old population.10,14,15,25 
For a given country, prevalence 
estimates may have included only 2- 
to 14-year-olds, only 15- to 17-year-
olds, or both (Supplemental Table 7, 
Supplemental Material).
Regional Estimates of Minimum 
Prevalences and Projected Numbers of 
Children Exposed to Past-year Violence
For each region, we derived 
estimates of the minimum prevalence 
of children exposed to past-year 
violence from the population-
weighted average of the country-
specific prevalences, and then 
applied the known prevalences to 
the entire region. The 96 countries 
with population-based data included 
24 in Africa, 20 in Asia, 9 in Latin/
South America, 3 in Northern 
America, 38 in Europe, and 2 in 
Oceania. We computed estimates 
separately for 2- to 14-year-old 
and 15-to 17-year-old populations, 
by using 2014 Census data53 to 
provide minimum prevalences of 
childhood violence by age (Table 2 
and Supplemental Material). Next, 
we used the estimates of regional 
prevalences from abstracted data 
to develop projected total minimum 
numbers of children exposed to 
violence in the corresponding 
region by age group. We then 
used the sum of the minimum 
regional numbers of children ages 
2 to 14 years and 15 to 17 years 
experiencing violence and the sum 
of corresponding regional 2014 
populations to estimate regional 
and global minimum prevalences 
and numbers of children ages 2 to 
17 years experiencing past-year 
violence. Finally, we used a similar 
population-weighted approach to 
estimate minimum prevalences of 
past-year violence against children 
based on the UN classification of 
developed and developing nations. 
The use of triangulation to critically 
synthesize data on past-year violent 
victimization across surveys allowed 
us to combine data for children living 
in nearly half the countries in the 
world; ∼42% of the world’s children 
reside in these countries.
RESULTS
Quality of Surveys
The majority of surveys in our 
review were high quality (Table 1). 
We confirmed 100% (112/112) of 
reports used probabilistic sampling, 
and 100% used standard definitions 
of exposures to violent behaviors. 
In addition, 96% (108/112) 
described training of interviewers/
questionnaire administrators, 93% 
(104/112) reported weighting 
findings, 100% reported whether 
their surveys were national (102) or 
subnational (10), and 70% (78/112) 
reported participation rates (39%–
99% range). Although nearly half 
of the countries in the world have 
published population-based data on 
at least 1 type of violence, this also 
means that half of the countries in 
the world do not have such data.
Synthesized Estimates
For the base case analysis of 
minimum prevalences of past-year 
violence among 2- to 14-year olds 
and 15- to 17-year-olds, we found 
that synthesized estimates for both 
age groups approached or exceeded 
50% for Africa, Asia, and Northern 
America, and exceeded 30% for 
Latin America (Table 2). For Europe, 
prevalences of the more severe types 
of violence included in the base 
case scenario tended to be lower 
than for other regions. We largely 
computed these base case minimum 
estimates for 2- to 14-year-olds 
by using country-specific highest 
reported prevalence for 1 type of 
violence (eg, severe physical violence 
by caregivers for most countries), 
because most surveys reporting 
exposures to any violence for this 
age included spanking in their 
definitions. In contrast, the sensitivity 
analyses did include prevalence 
measures of any violence; synthesis 
of results for 2- to 14-year-olds 
showed minimum prevalences of 
past-year violence exceeded 60% 
in Northern America, 60% in Latin 
America, 70% in Europe, 80% in Asia, 
and 80% in Africa (Table 3).
For the base case, our estimates for 
the entire group of 2- to 17-year-
olds indicated that a minimum of 
64% of these children in Asia, 56% 
in Northern America, 50% in Africa, 
34% in Latin America, and 12% 
in Europe experienced past-year 
violence (Table 4). The low estimate 
for Oceania is linked to the fact that 
representative surveys measuring 
prevalences of violence were only 
available for ages 15 to 17 years and 
thus, we assumed none of the 2- to 
14-year-olds experienced violence. 
An estimation of the total minimum 
numbers of children exposed, which 
is a function of both prevalence and 
size of the population-at-risk in 2014, 
shows Asia has the highest number, 
with over 700 million children 
exposed; Africa follows with over 200 
million children; then Latin America, 
Northern America, and Europe 
combined show over 100 million 
children exposed. The synthesized 
findings for the base case scenario 
indicate that, globally, a minimum of 
over 1 billion children were exposed 
to violence during 2014 (Table 4). 
For the sensitivity analysis, we found 
that a minimum of over 1.4 billion

of the nearly 2 billion children aged 
2 to 17 years experienced physical, 
emotional, and/or sexual violence in 
the previous year (Table 4). Though 
prevalences of violence were high in 
both the developing and developed 
world, the minimum number 
estimated as suffering victimization 
in the developing world in 2014 
exceeded 1 billion children (Table 5).
DISCUSSION
Our systematic review of studies used 
to derive minimum estimates of past-
year violence against children showed 
these population-based surveys 
were high quality.16 Most surveys 
had the following characteristics: 
probabilistic sampling, standard 
definitions, training of interviewers/
questionnaire administrators, 
weighting of estimates for complex 
designs, and national scope. If we 
assume our base-case scenario 
combining prevalences across 
approximately half of the countries 
are representative of overall minimum 
prevalence estimates for all countries, 
and thus can be projected to the 
entire population, then the number 
of children exposed to violence in the 
past year exceeds 1 billion, or half the 
children in the world. Region-specific 
estimates for children aged 2 to 17 
years indicate that the Asian, African, 
and Northern American regions had 
the highest minimum prevalences. 
Because of the sheer size of the Asian 
population, the minimum estimate 
of numbers of children experiencing 
past-year violence there was ∼2 times 
greater than in the other regions 
combined. Even more sobering were 
findings from the sensitivity analyses, 
which included moderate physical 
violence and showed three-fourths 
of the world’s children experienced 
violence in the previous year. 
Whether from the base case or from 
the sensitivity analysis, our findings 
compel urgent action.

that described in UNICEF’s Hidden in 
Plain Sight, also demonstrate an urgent 
need to escalate global commitments 
to protecting children.45 In our report, 
we critically synthesized population-
based measures of violence against 
children aged 2 to 17 years that are 
recent (past-year) and more serious 
to provide minimum regional and 
global estimates of the public health 
burden of violence against children. 
Our interest for the base scenario 
in more serious types of violence is 
linked to their potential to influence a 
range of public health consequences 
and to be associated with the kind 
of toxic stress that damages brain 
architecture in children.3,4,54Thus, 
given our findings, we estimate that 
violence may threaten the optimum 
development of over a billion brains 
in children, every year. Though we 
excluded moderate forms of violence, 
such as hitting a child on the buttocks 
or extremities in the base analysis, we 
included these forms in the sensitivity 
analysis, as evidence suggests spanking 
is considered a form of violence, 
violates rights to protection, can be 
harmful to development, and is linked 
with externalizing and internalizing 
behavior problems.55–63 Given that the 
new SDG agenda proposes ending all 
forms of violence against children, 
our synthesized estimates help 
convey the scale of this urgent global 
problem.
The overarching purpose of 
population-based surveys on violence 
against children is to drive national 
action plans that catalyze change.1 
Several surveys, including HBSC and 
NatSCEV, have been implemented 
repeatedly to monitor trends. An 
evaluation of trends in bullying 
from 2002–2010 by using HBSC, for 
example, shows no change in most of 
the 33 countries, although reductions 
were observed in one-third of 
countries.14 Similarly, over 3 waves 
of NatSCEV in the United States, 
from 2008–2014, there was no 
overall reduction in past-year violent 
victimization of children.47
We considered limitations that 
may have biased our estimates of 
past-year violence against children. 
The strongest limitation is that our 
estimates underreport prevalences 
for several reasons. First, since 
few surveys include the range of 
types, perpetrators, and locations 
of violence, base-case estimates 
were often computed on only 1 type 
of violence; for example, violent 
discipline in the home was the 
predominate type reported for 2- to 
14-year-olds, and either bullying, 
fighting, or multiple exposures 
(from VACS) for 15- to 17-year-
olds. However, for the sensitivity 
analyses, nearly half (n = 43) of the 
countries had data on exposure to 
multiple types of violence. We further 
underestimated prevalences by 
assuming none of the children ages 2 
to 14 years in Oceania were exposed, 
because no data were available for 
this age group. We also assumed, 
due to lack of data, that no children 
under 2 years were exposed. It is 
also possible that selection bias may 
have influenced our imputed regional 
estimates, if minimum prevalences 
of violence differ between those 
countries with and those without 
published estimates, or if in the 
several cases with only subnational 
estimates, those differ from national 
ones. There may also be differential 
bias between regions given 
variations in age distributions, types 
of violence reported, and proportion 
of the populations living in countries 
without estimates. Finally, we 
believe it is unlikely that our findings 
were meaningfully biased by our 
assumption that prevalences of 
violence were stable during the 
time period between their 
publication and 2014, the year of 
estimation of the population-at-risk. 
For over 90% of our estimates, this 
lag-time was 1 to 5 years. A recent 
report demonstrates trends in 
child maltreatment in 6 countries 
remained unchanged from the mid-
1970s through 201064; thus, it may 
be reasonable to assume violence 
rates were relatively constant over 
time.
Just as global recognition of the 
endemic magnitude of violence 
against children has sped forward 
over the past decade, the multisector 
evidence demonstrating that such 
violence is largely preventable has 
advanced.1,65,66 The state of evidence 
demonstrates interventions to address 
violence against children should cross 
strata of the socioecologic model, 
including the child, family, community, 
and society.1,67 For optimum impact, 
such policies and programs will be 
multisector, spanning health, social 
services, education, and justice 
sectors.1 In the United States, for 
example, although NatSCEV shows no 
overall reductions in recent trends 
in direct victimization of children, 
administrative data from child 
protection agencies shows a 40% 
decline in substantiated child sexual 
abuse from 1990 to 2000; this decline 
may be linked to the interplay of 
programs and policies implemented 
across sectors.68 The integration of 
multisector approaches with ones 
that are also multi-stakeholder 
should accelerate progress, 
engaging governments, business, 
nongovernmental, and civil society 
organizations in the shared goal of 
caring for the world’s children.
The World Health Organization, in 
collaboration with UNICEF, UNODC, 
PEPFAR, USAID, World Bank, US 
Department of State, Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention, and 
Together for Girls, is leading the 
development of a unified package of 
these 7 evidence-based strategies to 
prevent violence against children: 
teaching positive parenting skills, 
helping children develop social-
emotional skills and stay in school, 
raising access to health, protection, 
and support services, implementing 
and enforcing laws that protect 
all children, valuing social norms 
that protect children, empowering 
families economically, and sustaining 
safe environments for children. These

strategies are in large part built as 
an adaptation of the CDC THRIVES 
core package and similar guidance 
from WHO, UNICEF, PEPFAR, and 
USAID65–67,69–90
CONCLUSIONS
Our findings using population-
based data from approximately 
half of the countries in the world 
show that over 1 billion children 
ages 2 to 17 years have experienced 
violence in the past year. These data 
demonstrate an urgent need for wider 
adoption, scaling, and sustaining 
of evidence-based interventions to 
reduce this high burden of violence 
against children.89 Improved 
surveillance of the range of types, 
locations, and perpetrators of violence 
against children, as well as of access 
to key prevention interventions, is 
essential to target prevention, monitor 
progress, and drive the urgent action 
endorsed in the 2030 Sustainable 
Development Agenda.2 The time is 
ripe for the newly-established Global 
Partnership to End Violence Against 
Children to catalyze multi-stakeholder 
investments in expansive solutions for 
a billion children.2,91–93
