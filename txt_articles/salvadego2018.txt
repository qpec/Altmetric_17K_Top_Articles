Key points
r Superposition of hypoxia on 21 day bed rest did not worsen the impairment of skeletal muscle
oxidative function induced by bed rest alone.
r A significant impairment of maximal oxidative performance was identified downstream of
cardiovascular O2 delivery, involving both the intramuscular matching between O2 supply and
utilization and mitochondrial respiration.
r These chronic adaptations appear to be relevant in terms of exposure to spaceflights and
reduced gravity habitats (Moon or Mars), as characterized by low gravity and hypoxia, in
patients with chronic diseases characterized by hypomobility/immobility and hypoxia, as well
as in ageing.
Abstract Skeletal muscle oxidative function was evaluated in 11 healthy males (mean ± SD age
27 ± 5 years) prior to (baseline data collection, BDC) and following a 21 day horizontal bed
rest (BR), carried out in normoxia (PIO2 = 133 mmHg; N-BR) and hypoxia (PIO2 = 90 mmHg;
H-BR). H-BR was aimed at simulating reduced gravity habitats. The effects of a 21 day hypoxic
ambulatory confinement (PIO2 = 90 mmHg; H-AMB) were also assessed. Pulmonary O2 uptake

Maximal ADP-stimulated mitochondrial respiration decreased (P < 0.05) after all interventions

stream of cardiovascular O2 delivery, affecting both mitochondrial respiration and presumably
the intramuscular matching between O2 supply and utilization. Superposition of H on BR did
not worsen the impairment induced by BR alone.

Introduction
Bed rest (BR) studies are widely utilized as experimental
models for evaluating the physiological consequences of
prolonged muscle disuse and unloading (Pavy-Le Traon
et al. 2007), as experienced by astronauts in microgravity,
as well as by individuals exposed to injuries, chronic
diseases and ageing. Prolonged BR periods greatly affect
oxidative metabolism by acting at several levels of the
O2 pathway, with the skeletal muscles being one of these
(Pavy-Le Traon et al. 2007; Ade et al. 2015). In previous
BR studies, by utilizing an exercise paradigm (one-leg knee
extension) characterized by markedly elevated blood flows
(Richardson et al. 1993), in which any impairment of
oxidative function intrinsic to skeletal muscle becomes
fully manifest, we confirmed the presence of functional
constraints to oxidative function ‘downstream’ of bulk
cardiovascular O2 delivery (Porcelli et al. 2010; Salvadego
et al. 2011).
Spaceflights and future reduced gravity habitats (on
the Moon or Mars) are low gravity environments that
will expose astronauts not only to a condition of
muscle disuse/unloading, but also to a substantial hypo-
xic stimulus. Hypoxic spacecraft are planned to minimize
the risk of decompression sickness and thus to facilitate
extra-vehicular activity on the Moon and Mars. Similar
combined stressors of muscle disuse and hypoxia are also
encountered in pulmonary, cardiovascular and metabolic
diseases, as well as in ageing.
Hypoxia per se can enhance or deteriorate oxidative
function, depending on factors such as time of exposure,
degree of hypoxia, association with exercise and energy
balance (Cerretelli & Hoppeler, 1996; Calbet et al. 2003;
Jacobs et al. 2012, 2013). Thus, when associated with
physical inactivity, the hypoxic stimulus could pre-
serve or further impair oxidative function, with relevant
consequences for exercise tolerance and the quality of life
of subjects/astronauts/patients. In a previous study, we
observed that the superposition of hypoxia (F IO2 = 0.141;
corresponding to an altitude of �4000 m) during a
10-day horizontal BR did not aggravate the functional
impairmentofoxidativemetabolisminvivoinducedbyBR
alone and also did not affect mitochondrial respiration ex
vivo (Salvadego et al. 2016). Rather unexpectedly, super-
position of hypoxia actually attenuated/prevented some
of the impairments observed after BR alone (Salvadego
et al. 2016). This raised questions regarding the potential
interactive effects of hypoxia and bed rest during longer
periods of exposure, with the aim of better relating the
results to long-term spaceflights and chronic adaptations
to reduced gravity habitats.
The present ‘PlanHab: Planetary Habitat Simulation’
project was specifically designed to investigate the inter-
action between horizontal BR and hypoxia on human
physiological systems over a longer-term exposure. In
accordance with a randomized cross-over protocol,
healthy young male subjects were exposed for 21 days to
normoxic horizontal BR (N-BR), hypoxia (F IO2 = 0.141;
H) during upright ambulation (H-AMB), and combined
BR and hypoxia (H-BR); more details concerning the
experimental protocol are provided in Debevec et al.

Muscle oxidative metabolism after hypoxic bed rest
3
(2014). The hypoxic stimulus (PIO2
�90 mmHg),
corresponding to �4000 m of altitude, is similar (actually
slightly ‘stronger’) to that expected in future habitats on
the Moon or Mars (David et al. 2006). A 3-week time
period characterizes medium-term bed rest campaigns,
in accordance with ESA standards, and is typically
adopted for studying chronic adaptations to physical
inactivity/unloading.
In another study deriving from the PlanHab project,
Keramidas et al. (2016a) observed that a 21 day H-BR
induced a greater reduction in peak pulmonary ˙
VO2
( ˙
VO2peak) during exercise on a cycle ergometer than N-BR.
In the present study, the functional evaluation of oxidative
metabolism in vivo was carried out during knee-extensor
exercise, a paradigm in which the functional evaluation
is mainly focused downstream of cardiovascular O2
delivery (Andersen et al. 1985; Richardson et al. 1993;
Salvadego et al. 2011, 2016), inside skeletal muscle. Vastus
lateralis fractional O2 extraction and indices evaluating
the intramuscular matching between O2 delivery and
O2 consumption were investigated by near-infrared
spectroscopy (NIRS) (Grassi & Quaresima, 2016). Lower
limb blood flow was determined in the femoral artery by
ultrasound Doppler (R˚
adegran, 1997; Osada & R˚
adegran,
2009). In addition, mitochondrial respiratory function
was evaluated ex vivo in permeabilized vastus lateralis
fibres (Pesta & Gnaiger, 2012; Salvadego et al. 2016). We
hypothesized that, over a 21 day exposure, the super-
position of hypoxia on microgravity/unloading (bed rest)
would exacerbate the impairment of skeletal muscle
oxidative function, in vivo and ex vivo, compared to that
observed following bed rest alone.
Materials and methods
Ethical approval
Alloftheparticipantsofthestudywereinformedaboutthe
aims, procedures and possible risks of the investigations
andprovidedtheirwritteninformedconsenttoparticipate
in all of the experimental measurements. The study
was approved by the National Committee for Medical
Ethics at the Ministry of Health of the Republic of
Slovenia, conformed with the European Space Agency
recommendations for bed rest protocols (Standardization
of bed rest study conditions 1.5, August 2009), as well as
with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki (2000),
and was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02293772).
Subjects
The present study was part of the ‘PlanHab: Planetary
Habitat
Simulation’
research
program
(Framework
Program 7, European Commission) investigating the
effects of a 21 day combined exposure to H and BR on
cardiorespiratory,musculoskeletal,metabolic/nutritional,
immunological, thermoregulatory and neurohumoral
functions.
The
present
study
relates
to
muscular
adaptations. Further details on the whole project are
available elsewhere (Debevec et al. 2014; Keramidas et al.
2016a,b).
Eleven healthy recreationally active men (mean ± SD
age 27 ± 5 years) took part in this investigation, as well as
all of the investigations included in the PlanHab project;
their main physical characteristics at baseline are given in
Table 1.
None of the participants was engaged in competitive
sports activities or followed specific training programms
before and throughout the study. All the participants were
lowaltitude(<500m)residents.Participants’recruitment
procedure was based on the European Space Agency
recommendations (Standardization of bed rest study
conditions, version 1.5, August 2009). Exclusion criteria
were: a medical history of respiratory, hematological or
cardiovascular diseases; altitude exposure (>2000 m) in
the last 2 months prior to the experiments; participation
in dietary programmes during the last 6 months before the
experiments; and the use of drugs and (or) medications
(Debevec et al. 2014).
Experimental protocol
The experiments were carried out at the hypoxic facility
of the Olympic Sports Centre (Planica-Rateˇ
ce, Slovenia)
situated at an altitude of 940 m. The facility has the
capability to induce/maintain simulated altitudes in an
entire floor of the building, comprising 10 double rooms.
ThesimulationofaltitudewasachievedbyreducingtheO2
fraction in the rooms/living areas using a Vacuum Pressure
Swing Adsorption system (b-Cat, Tiel, The Netherlands).
The ambient O2 fraction was continuously monitored
and adjusted to the target simulated altitude (see below)
(Debevec et al. 2014).
Each participant underwent three 21 day campaigns
in a randomized order: normobaric normoxic (fraction
of inspired O2, F IO2 = 0.209; PIO2 = 133.1 ± 0.3 mm
Hg) horizontal bed rest (N-BR); hypoxic (F IO2 = 0.141;
PIO2 = 90.0 ± 0.4 mm Hg, target simulated altitude
of �4000 m) horizontal bed rest (H-BR); hypoxic
(F IO2 = 0.141; PIO2 = 90.0 ± 0.4 mm Hg) ambulatory
confinement (H-AMB). The interventions were separated
by a 4-month washout period to allow the effects
of prior exposure to hypoxia and/or bed rest to be
eliminated.
During the bed rest interventions (N-BR and H-BR),
no deviations from the lying position, nor muscle
stretching or static contractions, were permitted. Sub-
jects in H-AMB were allowed to move freely within the
hypoxic area and were engaged in two 30 min bouts
of low-intensity exercise per day (stepping, cycling or

noon. Adherence to the assigned protocol was ensured
usingcontinuousclosed-circuittelevisionsurveillanceand
constantsupervisionbyresearchersandmedicalstaff.Sub-
jects consumed an individually tailored, standardized diet
and were allowed to drink water and tea ad libitum. Details
of the study design, physical activity and daily energy
intakes during interventions are provided in Debevec et al.
2014. The environmental conditions within the facility
remained stable throughout the experimental sessions
(ambienttemperature=22.4±2.1°C;relativehumidity=
40 ± 11%; ambient pressure = 689 ± 6 mm Hg). All
tests were conducted under close medical supervision and
following standard safety procedures.
Before data collection, subjects were allowed time to
gain familiarity with the investigators and experimental
arrangement, and were familiarized with the exercise
protocols by means of short preliminary practice
runs. Subjects underwent to a very tight schedule
of experimental tests before and after each inter-
vention. For the purposes of the present study, sub-
jects performed two incremental exercise protocols
on a custom-built knee-extension ergometer (modified
Monarkcycleergometer)(Andersenetal.1985).Testswere
performed 3 and 1 days before (baseline data collection;
BDC) and 2 and 4 days after each intervention; their order
was randomized among subjects and kept constant before
and after all the interventions.
During knee extension, subjects were constrained on
an adjustable seat by a safety belt, which anchored the
angle of the hip at �90°. Subjects pushed on a padded
bar attached to a lever arm connected to the crank of
the cycle ergometer, allowing knee extension between
�90 and �170°. This type of exercise confines muscle
contractile activity to the quadriceps femoris muscle of
one leg, which is activated during the extension phase.
The return of the leg to the starting position is brought
about passively by the momentum of the flywheel of the
ergometer (Salvadego et al. 2011). After an initial 2 min
of unloaded knee-extension exercise, an incremental test
was performed with the right leg. Work rate was increased
by 6 W every minute, aiming to allow the subjects to
reach voluntary exhaustion in �10 min. Work rate was
applied by adjusting the tension of a strap around the
ergometer flywheel, as in a mechanically braked cycle
ergometer. Throughout the test, the active knee extension
and passive knee flexion cycle was carried out at a cadence
of �40 min−1, as imposed by a metronome. During each
cycle(totaldurationof1.5s),kneeextensionlasted�1s.In
other words, muscle contraction corresponded to �65%
of the duty cycle.
All exercises were conducted to voluntary exhaustion,
which was defined as the inability to maintain the imposed
work rate at the required frequency and through the
full range of motion despite vigorous encouragement by
the operators. Mean values of pulmonary ventilation, gas
exchange, heart rate, and muscle and cerebral oxygenation
indices (see below) were calculated during the last 30 s of
each work rate; values obtained during the exhausting
work rate were considered as peak values.
Measurements
Anthropometry. Body
mass
(BM),
regional
and
whole body composition were assessed before and
immediately after each campaign with dual-energy X-ray
absorptiometry (DEXA) using a fan-beam densitometer
(Discovery W – QDR series; Hologic, Marlborough, MA,
USA). More details on the DEXA technique and analysis
are reported in Debevec et al. 2014. The lean mass of
the lower limbs was measured as the sum of the fat-free
masses of the legs and thighs. Skinfold measurements
were made by a caliper at the site of placement of the
NIRS probe on the vastus lateralis muscle, aiming to
estimate skin and subcutaneous adipose tissue thickness.
Cardiopulmonary and metabolic variables. Pulmonary
ventilation ( ˙
VE), tidal volume (VT), respiratory frequency
(fR), O2 uptake ( ˙
VO2) and CO2 output ( ˙
VCO2) were
determined on a breath-by-breath basis by means of
a metabolic unit (Quark CPET; Cosmed, Rome, Italy).
Expiratory flow measurements were performed by a
turbine flow meter calibrated before each experiment by a
3 L syringe at three different flow rates. Calibration of O2
and CO2 analysers was performed before each experiment
by utilizing gas mixtures of known composition. The

VCO2/ ˙
VO2. ˙
VO2peak
values were expressed as L min−1 and normalized for the
lean mass of the thigh.
Heart rate (HR) was determined using a heart rate
monitor (RS 400; Polar, Kempele, Finland). Capillary
oxyhaemoglobin saturation (SaO2) was continuously
monitored by pulse oximetry (MicrO2; Siemens Medical
Systems, Danvers, MA, USA) at the finger. Ratings of
perceived exertion (RPE) for dyspnoea and limb effort
were obtained at rest and at every work rate of the
incremental exercise using the Borg’s modified CR10 scale
(Borg, 1998). Peak power output was taken as an index of
performance.
Skeletal
muscle
and
cerebral
oxygenation. Vastus
lateralis muscle and cerebral (frontal cortex) oxygenation
profiles
during
exercise
were
evaluated
by
NIRS.
Principles, limitations and potential applications of this
method have been discussed in detail for skeletal muscle
(Grassi & Quaresima, 2016) and brain (Ferrari et al. 2016).
NIRS measurements in muscle tissue have been shown
to be well correlated with local venous O2 saturation. A
limitation of the NIRS approach is related to the fact that
only a relatively small and superficial portion of the tissue
of interest can be investigated.
Cerebral oxygenation profiles were monitored with a
continuous three-wavelength (735, 810 and 850 nm) NIRS
device (NIRO-200NX; Hamamatsu Photonics, Shizuoka,
Japan). The probe was positioned over the left prefrontal
cortex at the midpoint between Fp1 and F3 landmarks of
the international EEG 10–20 system. Data were recorded
at 5 Hz, and expressed relative to the resting period of each
trial. The Beer-Lambert law was used to calculate micro-
molar (μM) changes in tissue oxygenation (�[oxy(Hb)]
and �[deoxy(Hb)]) using received optical densities and
a differential path-length factor of 5.93. Measurements
obtained during exercise were normalized as changes
from an initial value arbitrarily defined as 0 μM. Total
(�[oxy + deoxy(Hb)]) was taken as an index of changes
in regional blood volume.
For
muscle
measurements,
a
portable
NIR
continuous-wave
instrument
(PortaMon;
Artinis,
Elst, The Netherlands) was utilized. The instrument
measures micromolar (μM) changes in oxygenated
haemoglobin (Hb) + myoglobin (Mb) concentrations
(�[oxy(Hb + Mb)]), and in deoxygenated [Hb + Mb]
(�[deoxy(Hb + Mb)]), with respect to an initial value
arbitrarily set equal to zero and obtained during the
resting condition preceding the test. The sum of the two
variables (�[total(Hb + Mb)]) is related to changes in
the total Hb volume in the muscle region of interest.
Specific details on the method are provided in recent
papers by our group (Salvadego et al. 2011, 2013).
Incontractingmuscle,�[deoxy(Hb+Mb)]isrelatively
insensitive to changes in blood volume and has been
considered an estimate of skeletal muscle fractional O2
extraction (ratio between ˙
VO2 and O2 delivery [ ˙
Q O2])
(Grassi & Quaresima, 2016). A ‘physiological calibration’
of�[deoxy(Hb+Mb)]valueswasperformedbyinducing
a transient ischaemia of the limb when the subject
was sitting on the ergometer few minutes after the
exercise. Data obtained during exercise were expressed as a
percentage of the value of maximal muscle deoxygenation
obtained in each subject by inflating a pressure cuff (at
300–350 mmHg) at the inguinal crease of the thigh for
a few minutes, until the �[deoxy(Hb + Mb)] increase
reached a plateau (Porcelli et al. 2012).
The presence of a deoxygenation ‘overshoot’ (trans-
itory sharp increase in �[deoxy(Hb + Mb)] above the
steady-state (Grassi & Quaresima, 2016) was investigated
during the first 2 min of constant work rate exercise
(Porcelli et al. 2014). Data were first fitted by a
mono-exponential function of the type:
y(t) = ybas + Atot[1 − e(t − TDTot)/τTot]
(1)
and parameter values (TDTot, τTot) were determined that
yieldedthelowestsumofsquaredresiduals.Ineqn(1),yBAS

TDTot is the time delay and τTot is the time constant of the

Data were then fitted by a double exponential function
of the type:
y(t) = ybas + Au[1 − e(t − TDu)/τu] + Ad[1 − e(t − TDd)/τd]
(2)
In eqn (2) Au indicates the amplitude of the upward
component between yBAS and the transient steady-state

the time delay; and τu is the time constant of the upward
component of the function. Ad, TDd and τd indicate,
respectively, the amplitude, time delay and time constant
of the downward (d) component.
The equation that best fit the experimental data was
determined by an F test. The area under the best fitting
curves was calculated by integration, after subtracting the
resting values.
Femoral artery blood flow. Blood flow in the common
femoral artery was estimated by measurements of
mean blood flow velocity and vessel diameter distal
to the inguinal ligament, 1 cm above the profound
femoral branch, using an ultrasonographic equipment
(Vivid 9; GE Healthcare, Horten, Norway) with a
linear array multifrequency transducer (4.5–12 MHz).
Two-dimensional measurements of the arterial lumen
were made from B-mode image in longitudinal view;
blood flow velocities were collected with the sample
volume covering more than 75% of the arterial lumen, and

with an angle correction always kept at 50°. Arterial blood
flow was calculated by multiplying arterial cross-sectional
area by the time integral of the mean blood flow velocity
over a period of 10–15 knee-extension cycles, during the
last 30 s of each sampling period (Radegran, 1997; Osada
& Radegran, 2009).
Mitochondrial respiration ex vivo. Muscle samples were
obtained
from
the
vastus
lateralis
muscle
of
the
non-dominant leg in the morning after a night of fasting
(�10 h). The biopsy was taken, for all subjects, 1 day
before each intervention and on the last day of each inter-
vention; the baseline biopsy was taken in a normoxic
environment (air), whereas the intervention biopsies were
taken in the prevailing ambient gas environment. The
subject was transferred to the laboratory in a supine
position and a sample was obtained from the superficial
mid-portion of the vastus lateralis muscle. The site was
anaesthetized by injecting 2–4 mL of 2% lidocaine hydro-
chloride. Following the application of the anaesthetic, a
1–1.5 cm incision was made to the skin, subcutaneous
tissue and muscle fascia, and the muscle sample was
removed using a Weil-Blakesley rongeur biopsy forceps
(Gebr¨
uder Zepf Medizintechnik, Tuttlingen, Germany).
The muscle samples were divided into several portions.
One portion (�20 mg wet weight) was immediately frozen
in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80°C until determination
of citrate synthase (CS) protein expression (see below).
Anotherportion(�15mgwetweight)wasusedtoevaluate
mitochondrial respiration ex vivo (Pesta & Gnaiger, 2012)
and was immediately placed in an ice-cold preservation
solution (BIOPS; Oroboros Instruments, Innsbruck,
Austria) containing: EGTA-calcium buffer (10 mM) (free
Ca2+ concentration 100 nmol L−1), imidazole (20 mM),
taurine (20 mM), K+/4 morpholinoethanesulphonic acid
(50 mM), dithiothreitol (0.5 mM), MgCl2 (6.56 mM), ATP
(5.77 mM) and phosphocreatine (15 mM) (pH 7.1).
Fibre bundles were separated with sharp-ended needles,
leaving only small areas of contact, incubated in the above
solution (4°C) containing 10% (w/v) fatty acid free BSA
and 30% (v/v) DMSO, and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen.
The samples were stored at –80°C until analysis, which
was carried out within 1 month (Kuznetsov et al. 2003;
W¨
ust et al. 2012; Salvadego et al. 2016).
For analysis, the fibre bundles were quickly thawed in
a water bath at 37°C and washed in BIOPS containing
2 mg mL−1 BSA to remove any residual DMSO from the
tissue. Fibres were then incubated in 5 mL of BIOPS (4 °C)
containing 50 g mL−1 saponin for 30 min with continuous
gentle stirring to ensure complete permeabilization. After
being rinsed twice for 10 min in a respiration medium
(MiR05l Oroboros Instruments; 0.5 mM EGTA, 60 mM
potassium lactobionate, 3 mM MgCl2 6H2O, 20 mM
taurine, 10 mM KH2PO4, 20 mM Hepes, 110 mM sucrose
and 1 g L−1 BSA, pH 7.1), permeabilized fibres were
measured for wet weight and immediately transferred into
a respirometer (Oxygraph-2k; Oroboros Instruments) for
the analysis.
Mitochondrial respiratory function was evaluated
by measuring O2 consumption polarographically by
high-resolution respirometry (Pesta & Gnaiger, 2012).
Data were digitally recorded using DatLab4 software
(Oroboros Instruments). The instrumentation allows for
O2 consumption measurements with small amounts of
sample in closed respiration chambers containing 3 mL
of air-saturated respiration medium at 37 °C; 3–5 mg
of muscle fibres were used for the analysis. Standardized
instrumental and chemical calibrations were performed
to correct for back-diffusion of O2 into the chamber from
the various components (e.g. leak from the exterior, O2
consumption by the chemical medium and by the sensor
O2) (Pesta & Gnaiger, 2012). The O2 concentration in
the chamber was maintained between 300 and 400 μM
(average O2 partial pressure �250 mmHg) to avoid O2
limitation of respiration. Intermittent reoxygenation steps
were performed during the experiments by injections
of 1–3 μl of 200 mM H2O2, which was instantaneously
dismutated by catalase, already present in the medium, to
O2 and H2O. All respirometric analyses were performed
in duplicate.
A
substrate-uncoupler-inhibitor-titration
protocol,
with a substrate combination that matches physiological
intracellular conditions, was applied (Pesta & Gnaiger,
2012; Salvadego et al. 2013, 2016). Non-phosphorylating
resting mitochondrial respiration was measured in the
presence of malate (4 mM) and glutamate (10 mM) and in
the absence of adenylates, so that O2 consumption was
mainly driven by the back leakage of protons through
the inner mitochondrial membrane (‘leak’ respiration).
ADP-stimulated
mitochondrial
respiration
sustained
by Complex I (state 3 respiration) was measured by
stepwise additions of ADP (2.5 mM) as phosphate
acceptor, with malate and glutamate as substrates.
Succinate (10 mM) was added to support convergent
electron flow into the Q-junction through complexes
I
and
II.
Maximal
ADP-stimulated
mitochondrial
respiration was then determined in the presence of
saturating [ADP] (5 mM). The addition of cytochrome c
(10 μM) had no significant additive effects on respiration,
with minor increases of �5%, thereby confirming the
integrity of the outer mitochondrial membrane. We also
examined electron transport system capacity by stepwise
addition
of
the
chemical
uncoupler
protonophore
carbonylcyanide-p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone
(FCCP) to optimum concentration (1.25 μM). Rotenone
(1 μM) and anti-mycin A (2.5 μM) were added to inhibit
complexes I and III, providing a measure of residual
O2
consumption,
indicative
of
non-mitochondrial
O2
consumption.

O2 consumption. The degree of coupling of oxidative
phosphorylation for a specific substrate supply (glutamate
and malate in this case) was determined by calculating the
ratio between state 3 respiration minus leak respiration
and state 3 respiration [(state 3 – leak)/state 3] (Pesta &
Gnaiger, 2012).
CS content. Frozen muscle samples were pulverized and
re-suspended in a lysis buffer [20 mM Tris-HCl, 1% Triton
X-100, 10% glycerol, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 100 mM
NaF and 2 mM NaPPi supplemented with protease and
phosphatase inhibitors (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO,
USA) and 1 mM phenylmethanesulphonyl fluoride]. The
obtained homogenate was centrifuged at 18.000 g for
20 min at 4°C. Muscle extracted proteins (15 μg) were
loaded on gradient precast gels (AnyKd) purchased from
Bio-Rad (Hercules, CA, USA) and were electrotransferred
to nitrocellulose membranes at 100 V for 2 h at 4 °C.
The membranes were incubated with the anti-CS primary
antibodies (Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA) overnight.
Thereafter, membranes were blocked in 5% milk and then
incubated in anti-rabbit IgG HRP-conjugated secondary
antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA, USA)
for 1 h. The protein bands were visualized by an enhanced
chemiluminescence method. The content of CS protein
was assessed by determining the brightness–area product
of the protein band and normalizing on actin content, as
described previously (Brocca et al. 2012).
Statistical analysis
The results were expressed as the mean ± SD. To evaluate
the effects of N-BR and H-BR, linear mixed effect (LME)
models were constructed with subject as random effect
and with the H-AMB data excluded. For all variables, time
(Before vs. After), condition (N-BR vs. H-BR) and their
interaction were used as fixed effects. Data from the base-
line collection phases were not significantly different and
were lumped together (BDC). The H-AMB data were then
analysed via LME with time as random effect and subject
as fixed effect. LME models were optimized according
to Akaike’s information criterion. Data were Box-Cox
transformed when non-linear quantile-quantile plots
or heteroscedasticity were found. Models for statistical
testing of the primary hypothesis were simplified in a
stepwise manner. First, the time × condition interaction
term was discarded where justified by non-significance
and Akaike’s criterion, and condition term was discarded
in the next step. Any significant effects were followed
up with treatment contrasts, using BDC and N-BR
as reference. Data fitting by exponential functions was
performed using the least squares residuals method.
P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Statistical
analyses were carried out using software packages (Prism,
version 5.0; GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA, USA;
SPSS, version 13.0.1; SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).
Results
Values of BM, body mass index, lean body mass, fat body
mass and thigh lean mass are reported in Table 1. BM
decreased significantly (by �5%) after N-BR and H-BR.
Lean body mass and the lean mass of the thigh decreased
significantly (by �6–8%) after all interventions. Fat body
mass did not change after the interventions. The mean
values of skin and adipose tissue thickness measured at the
site of placement of the NIRS probe ranged between 11.0
and 11.6 mm and were not altered by any intervention.
Peak values of the main cardiovascular, ventilatory and
gas-exchange variables determined at exhaustion are pre-
sented in Table 2. ˙
VE peak, RPE-dyspnoea and HR peak
values suggest that, as expected, the exercise was not

No capillary oxyhaemoglobin desaturation (see SaO2 peak
values) was observed following any intervention. RPE-leg
and R peak values (�1.15–1.21 under all conditions)
suggest that the exercise was maximal for the involved
muscles. Peak pulmonary ˙
VO2 (L min−1) was lower after
both N-BR (−7%) and H-BR (−9 %) vs. BDC. As for
H-AMB, values were not significantly different vs. BDC.

inferences can be drawn by the analysis of these data
because both ˙
VO2 (determined at the pulmonary level)
and blood flow (determined in the femoral artery) were
not specifically measured at the level of the exercising
muscle(thequadricepsofoneleg);moreover,thighmuscle
mass and not quadriceps muscle mass was determined.
Nonetheless, it appears that, when blood flow and ˙
VO2
are expressed per unit of muscle mass, the impaired O2
extraction in N-BR and H-BR is compensated for by an
increased blood flow (by �20%), yielding an unchanged
˙
VO2. The compensation does not occur when blood flow
and ˙
VO2 are expressed in absolute terms, in which case
blood flow values were unchanged across conditions and
lower ˙

H-AMB. The mean ± SD values of the amplitude of
the overshoot, the area under the overshoot and the area

in Table 3. The amplitude and the area of the overshoot
were greater after N-BR and H-BR vs. BDC, whereas no
differences between conditions were observed for the area
under the total �[deoxy(Hb + Mb)] response.
Mean ± SD values of femoral artery blood flow
determined every 40 s over the first 2 min of unloaded
knee extension are shown in Fig. 4. Although the relatively
long time-resolution of the measurement was not ideal
for this type of analysis and may attenuate transient over-
shoots or undershoots of the response, the mean ± SD
data strongly suggest that the blood flow data reached a
steady-state at 20–30 s of exercise. Values at rest and during
exercise were similar among conditions.
CS expression, taken as an estimate of mitochondrial
content, was not significantly different among the
experimental conditions (0.10 ± 0.03 arbitrary units
in BDC; 0.10 ± 0.02 in N-BR; 0.10 ± 0.01 in
H-BR; 0.09 ± 0.03 in H-AMB). The main data related
to mitochondrial respiration determined ex vivo in
isolated permeabilized fibres are shown in Fig. 5.
Maximal ADP-stimulated mitochondrial respiration and
the maximal capacity of the electron transport system,
as induced by the chemical uncoupler FCCP, were
significantly lower under all experimental conditions
vs. BDC. Mitochondrial leak respiration was higher in
N-BR, whereas no significant differences were observed
in H-BR or H-AMB. The degree of coupling of oxidative
phosphorylation[(State3–Leak)/State3]ataspecificsub-
strate supply (glutamate and malate), was lower in N-BR
vs. BDC, whereas no significant differences were observed
between H-BR or H-AMB and BDC.

present study deal with a functional evaluation of skeletal
muscle oxidative metabolism, both in vivo and ex vivo.
Refuting our hypothesis, superposition of H on BR
did not worsen the expected BR-induced impairment of
skeletal muscle oxidative function in vivo, as evaluated
by ˙
VO2peak, peak skeletal muscle fractional O2 extraction
and temporal profiles of O2 extraction during constant
work-rate exercise. The measurements were carried out
during dynamic one-leg knee-extension exercise, in
which central cardiovascular constraints are significantly
attenuated as a consequence of the relatively small muscle
mass involved in the exercise (the quadriceps of one leg)
and any impairment of oxidative function intrinsic to
skeletal muscle becomes fully manifest (Andersen et al.
1985; Richardson et al. 1993; Salvadego et al. 2011, 2016).
In the present study, no systemic limitations to exercise
performance were observed, both in terms of cardio-
respiratory function (e.g. SaO2, ˙
VE, R, RPE-dyspnoea)
and in terms of cerebral oxygenation. This confirms the
adequacy of the employed exercise protocol in specifically
investigating oxidative metabolism at the skeletal muscle
level.

using the same exercise paradigm following a BR exposure
of shorter duration (10 days) (Salvadego et al. 2016). This
suggests that, after an initial decrease occurring during the
first 10 days of exposure to N-BR, these variables do not
present a further significant decrease during the following
10 days of exposure. Moreover, the similar impairments
in pulmonary
˙
VO2peak and �[deoxy(Hb + Mb)]peak
suggest that the decreased maximal aerobic performance
was substantially the result of a decreased capacity of O2
extraction by skeletal muscles. Confirming this concept
(Fig. 2), peak femoral artery blood flow values were not
different across conditions and, when expressed per unit
of thigh muscle mass, they were actually higher in N-BR
and in H-BR vs. BDC.
Also in our previous study, the addition of H to BR
(H-BR) did not exacerbate the reduction of ˙
VO2peak and
�[deoxy(Hb + Mb)]peak during knee extension observed
following BR alone (Salvadego et al. 2016). By contrast
to our previous study, however, H did not attenuate the
impairment of muscle oxidative function induced by
BR alone in the present study. It could be hypothesized
that, following a relatively prolonged exposure, any
‘protective’ effect of H on muscle O2 delivery (e.g.
increased [Hb]) would be counterbalanced, at least to
some extent, by some impairments at other levels, such
as mitochondrial respiration (see below). It is interesting
to observe that the decreases observed in the present
study after H-BR were somewhat less pronounced (in
particular in terms of �[deoxy(Hb + Mb)]peak) than
those reported by Keramidas et al. (2016a) for the same
subjects and the same environmental conditions, during
cycle ergometer exercise, an exercise paradigm in which
central cardiovascular constraints contribute to limit
oxidative metabolism and aerobic performance.
In the present study, a 6–8% decrease in thigh muscle
mass was observed under all experimental conditions,
notwithstanding a tightly controlled energy balance
(Debevec et al. 2014). When pulmonary ˙
VO2peak was
normalized per unit of thigh muscle mass, no significant
differences were observed between BDC and N-BR
or H-BR. This observation suggests that the observed
changes in skeletal muscle oxidative metabolism (in terms
of ˙
VO2peak) were substantially quantitative, in other words
related to the decreased muscle mass. This may appear
in contradiction with the observed decrease of peak
fractional O2 extraction at the level of the vastus lateralis
muscle and with the impairment of mitochondrial
respiration observed in isolated fibres of the same
muscle (see below). The apparent contradiction might

be reconciled by hypothesizing that these functional
impairments were masked by an elevated muscle blood
flow, which is typical of this type of exercise (Andersen
et al. 1985; Richardson et al. 1993). As noted above, in the
present study, peak blood flow in the femoral artery was
higher in N-BR and H-BR vs. BDC when the variable was
expressed per unit of thigh muscle mass, whereas it was
unchanged (confirming a previous observation by Weber
et al. 2014 in subjects undergoing limb unloading) vs.
BDC when it was expressed in absolute terms.
The dynamic profiles of �[deoxy(Hb + Mb)] during
the first 2 min of unloaded knee extension were analysed to
evaluate parameters related to the intramuscular matching
between O2 delivery and O2 consumption in the vastus
lateralis muscle (Porcelli et al. 2010, 2014, 2016; Grassi
& Quaresima, 2016; Salvadego et al. 2016). After both
N-BR and H-BR, the time-course of �[deoxy(Hb + Mb)]
was characterized by a transient overshoot, which was not
evident in BDC or after H-AMB. This overshoot implies
an impaired/delayed matching between intramuscular O2
deliveryandmetabolicdemand,andhasthesamemeaning
as the undershoot of microvascular PO2 described by
phosphorescence quenching under different experimental
conditions (Koga et al. 2014; Heinonen et al. 2015). A
lowering of microvascular PO2, albeit transitory, would
determine a decreased driving pressure for blood-myocyte
O2
flux,
thereby
impairing
oxidative
metabolism
(Koga et al. 2014; Heinonen et al. 2015). Similar
�[deoxy(Hb + Mb)] responses during metabolic trans-
itions were observed after 10 days (Salvadego et al. 2016)
and 35 days (Porcelli et al. 2010) of N-BR and, to a lesser
extent, after 10 days of H-BR (Salvadego et al. 2016). Also
for this variable, in the present study the superposition of
H on BR did not affect the response induced by BR alone.
During the transition from rest to unloaded knee
extension, we evaluated also the dynamics of arterial
blood flow to the lower limb. As shown in Fig. 4, the
time-course of this variable was substantially identical
across
experimental
conditions:
a
fast
exponential
increase, reaching a steady-state (whose values were not
different across conditions) in �20 s. Notwithstanding,
the time resolution of measurements was not ideal for
discriminating kinetics patterns, the unchanged values
over time in all experimental conditions suggest the
absence of any overshoot or undershoot in arterial
flow with metabolic transitions, and thus an unchanged
vascular function, at least at the level of the major
feeding vessels. This response should be analysed in
conjunction with that of �[deoxy(Hb + Mb)] (O2
extraction), described above. Because the overshoots in O2
extraction observed after N-BR and H-BR were probably
not associated with overshoots/undershoots of blood flow
in the main artery supplying the muscle, an impairment
of the matching between O2 delivery and O2 consumption
was presumably responsible for the extraction over-
shoot and presumably affected peripheral O2 diffusion
and mitochondrial energetics. The mismatch could
derive from a suboptimal nitric oxide signalling within

the muscle, which would ‘uncouple’ the heterogeneous
microvascular blood flow increase from the presumably
heterogeneous O2 consumption increase (Poole et al.
2012), and it has also been described in patients with
chronic heart failure (Sperandio et al. 2009), as well as in
patients with metabolic myopathies (Porcelli et al. 2014,
2016). According to another possibility, the transient over-
shoot in O2 extraction may be the consequence of an
accumulation of blood in skeletal muscle at rest, which
has been hypothesized to occur during bed rest (Rittweger
et al. 2013). In this situation, the muscle may transiently
increase O2 extraction from the increased blood reservoir
in the muscle. This scenario, however, does not appear to
be compatible with the apparent unchanged adjustment of
arterial blood flow described in the present study under all
conditions. The mechanistic hypotheses mentioned above
could not be directly tested.

Muscle oxidative metabolism after hypoxic bed rest
13
2012). Different from the 10 day study (Salvadego
et al. 2016), in which no changes were observed, in the
present study, maximal ADP-stimulated mitochondrial
respiration, which is the maximal respiration in isolated
non-contracting permeabilized fibres, in the presence of
saturating ADP levels and unlimited substrates and O2
availability, was significantly impaired (�30% decreases)
following all interventions. Also for this variable, the
impairment observed following BR alone was not
aggravated by H. In short, relatively long (20 days)
exposures impaired mitochondrial respiratory function,
whereas shorter exposures (10 days) did not (Salvadego
et al. 2016).
Similar to that observed in the 10 day study (Salvadego
et al. 2016), mitochondrial content of the tissue, as
estimated by CS expression, was not affected by any inter-
vention. Thus, the observed changes in mitochondrial
respiration were qualitative. It should also be considered
that, in the presence of a decreased muscle mass,
an unchanged mitochondrial content is presumably
associated with a decreased muscle mitochondrial mass.
‘Leak’ respiration (‘dissipation’ of the H+ gradient
across the inner mitochondrial membrane, not associated
with rephosphorylation of ADP) was enhanced following
N-BR, whereas this effect was reversed following H-BR
and H-AMB. The enhanced leak respiration in N-BR was
associated with a reduced coupling between oxidation
and phosphorylation, suggesting a lower efficiency of
oxidative phosphorylation. These findings are consistent
with an upregulation of muscle protein UCP-3 following
prolonged muscle unloading (Mazzatti et al. 2008), which
would protect cells against an excessive mitochondrial
reactive oxygen species formation, albeit at the cost of an
increased energy dissipation.
As far as the molecular mechanisms responsible for
the observed changes, some hypotheses can be proposed.
Skeletal muscle atrophy following disuse/unloading is
the result of decreased protein synthesis and increased
protein degradation, which are triggered by oxidative
stress (Powers et al. 2012) and/or altered mitochondrial
function and structure (Cannavino et al. 2014, 2015).
In this perspective, mitochondrial alterations induced
by inactivity/microgravity would be responsible for the
impairment of mitochondrial respiration and could
be one of the factors leading to muscle atrophy. In
hypoxia, a down-regulation of electron transport chain
complexes (possibly aimed at mitigating the increase in
reactive oxygen species production) would be induced
by decreased levels of peroxisome proliferative activated
receptor-γ coactivator-α (Murray & Horscroft, 2016)
and would explain the impaired maximal mitochondrial
respiration described in the present study. We recognize
that further biochemical, molecular and structural studies
would be needed to gain more mechanistic insights into
the impairment of mitochondrial function.
In the present study, the respiratory impairment
observed in H-AMB at the fibre level did not translate into
a functional impairment in vivo during small muscle mass
exercise, as also observed in the study by Calbet et al. 2009.
It can be hypothesized that this observation, together with
the absence of further functional impairments following
H-BR, compared to N-BR, could be attributed, at least
in part, to the increased blood [Hb] occurring in hypoxia
(Keramidas et al. 2016b).
The hypoxic stimulus utilized in the present study,
corresponding to 4000 m of altitude, is similar (albeit
slightly ‘stronger’) than that expected in future habitats
on the Moon or Mars (David et al. 2006). Such a stimulus
is sufficiently severe to induce a down-regulation of the
oxidative processes inside the skeletal muscle (Horscroft &
Murray, 2014) and a significant erythropoietin response,
as indeed demonstrated by Keramidas et al. (2016b) in
the same subjects of the present study.
Microgravity
(bed
rest)
impairs
peripheral
O2
diffusional conductance (Ade et al. 2015). However,
it is not known whether superposition of hypoxia on
microgravity further impairs this function, although
indirect data obtained in the present study and in a
previous study by Salvadego et al. (2016) suggest that
this is not the case. No structural analyses (muscle fibre
diameter, capillarization, etc.) could be performed on the
muscle samples obtained in the present study. Thus, we
cannot speculate how the observed muscle atrophy could
have affected peripheral O2 diffusion and cellular hypoxia
under the different conditions.
It should be acknowledged that the results of the present
study were obtained during knee-extension exercise,
carried out after the 3-week period of exposure to the
different experimental conditions, but in a normoxic
environment. Our main aim, however, was to compare
chronic adaptations to bed rest vs. chronic adaptations
to bed rest + hypoxia, and, accordingly, measurements
carried out in a hypoxic environment could represent a
confounding factor.
Moreover, the results of the present study relate only to
men and future investigations should focus on whether
similar responses are observed in women. Longer periods
of exposure to the experimental conditions would also be
of interest.
In conclusion, in the present study, after 21 days
of normoxic bed rest and hypoxic bed rest (where
the latter condition was aimed at simulating future
planetary habitats), a significant impairment of peak
oxidative metabolism ‘downstream’ of cardiovascular
O2 delivery was revealed. Superposition of hypoxia to
bed rest did not aggravate the impairment observed
following bed rest alone. The impaired oxidative function
in vivo was at least in part attributable to an impaired
mitochondrial respiratory function (which was not
detected in a previous study with a shorter exposure)

immobility/hypomobility
and
hypoxia
(e.g.
ageing,
cardiovascular and respiratory diseases), the impairment
of skeletal muscle oxidative function appears mainly
attributable to microgravity/immobility/hypomobility,
whereas the role of hypoxia is relatively marginal.
