Summary
Background In 2011, WHO member states signed up to the 25 × 25 initiative, a plan to cut mortality due to non-
communicable diseases by 25% by 2025. However, socioeconomic factors influencing non-communicable diseases 
have not been included in the plan. In this study, we aimed to compare the contribution of socioeconomic status to 
mortality and years-of-life-lost with that of the 25 × 25 conventional risk factors.
Methods We did a multicohort study and meta-analysis with individual-level data from 48 independent prospective 
cohort studies with information about socioeconomic status, indexed by occupational position, 25 × 25 risk factors 
(high alcohol intake, physical inactivity, current smoking, hypertension, diabetes, and obesity), and mortality, for a 
total population of 1 751 479 (54% women) from seven high-income WHO member countries. We estimated the 
association of socioeconomic status and the 25 × 25 risk factors with all-cause mortality and cause-specific mortality by 
calculating minimally adjusted and mutually adjusted hazard ratios [HR] and 95% CIs. We also estimated the 
population attributable fraction and the years of life lost due to suboptimal risk factors.
Findings During 26·6 million person-years at risk (mean follow-up 13·3 years [SD 6·4 years]), 310 277 participants 
died. HR for the 25 × 25 risk factors and mortality varied between 1·04 (95% CI 0·98–1·11) for obesity in men and 
2 ·17 (2·06–2·29) for current smoking in men. Participants with low socioeconomic status had greater mortality 
compared with those with high socioeconomic status (HR 1·42, 95% CI 1·38–1·45 for men; 1·34, 1·28–1·39 for 
women); this association remained significant in mutually adjusted models that included the 25 × 25 factors (HR 1·26, 
1·21–1·32, men and women combined). The population attributable fraction was highest for smoking, followed by 
physical inactivity then socioeconomic status. Low socioeconomic status was associated with a 2·1-year reduction in 
life expectancy between ages 40 and 85 years, the corresponding years-of-life-lost were 0·5 years for high alcohol 
intake, 0·7 years for obesity, 3·9 years for diabetes, 1·6 years for hypertension, 2·4 years for physical inactivity, and 
4·8 years for current smoking.
Interpretation Socioeconomic circumstances, in addition to the 25 × 25 factors, should be targeted by local and global 
health strategies and health risk surveillance to reduce mortality.

Introduction
The 2013–20 World Health Organization (WHO) Global 
Action Plan for the Prevention and Control of Non-
Communicable Diseases (NCDs) targets seven major 
risk factors, comprising the harmful use of alcohol, 
insufficient physical activity, current tobacco use, raised 
blood pressure, intake of salt or sodium, diabetes, and 
obesity (referred to as the 25 × 25 risk factors), with the 
overall aim of reducing premature mortality from non-
communicable diseases by 25% by 2025.1 Similarly, the 
Global Burden of Disease (GBD) Collaboration, the 
largest study monitoring health changes globally, 
performs an annual risk assessment of the burden of 
disease and injury attributable to 67 risk factors in 
21 world-regions.2 Despite the fact that low socioeconomic 
status is one of the strongest predictors of morbidity and 
premature mortality worldwide,3–6 poor socioeconomic 
circumstances are not considered modifiable risk factors 
in these important global health strategies.
Socioeconomic circumstances and their consequences 
are modifiable by policies at the local, national, and 
international levels,7–9 as are risk factors targeted by 
existing global health strategies. Evidence also suggests 
that the burden of most 25 × 25 risk factors is concentrated 
in lower socioeconomic groups worldwide.10,11 Inter-

the 25 × 25 and other risk factors might therefore benefit 
from greater focus on socioeconomic adversity so that 
the preventive toolkit for addressing NCDs can be 
expanded. To examine this hypothesis, we collated 
individual-level data from 48 independent prospective 
cohort studies from Europe, the USA, and Australia and 
aimed to determine the population attributable fraction 
(PAF) and years of life lost (YLLs) due to low socio-
economic status and compared these with mortality and 
YLLs attributable to the 25 × 25 risk factors.
Methods
Study population
This study is part of an EC Horizon 2020 consortium, the 
Lifepath project, which includes ten cohort studies. We 
have complemented those data with publicly available 
data from 38 additional cohort studies from the Inter-
University Consortium for Political and Social Research 
and the UK Data Service. Our analyses were based on 
participants whose occupational position was assessed at 
baseline between 1965 and 2009, dependent on the study 
(appendix). The 48 studies comprised a total population 
of 1 751 479 men and women from seven WHO member 
countries (UK, France, Switzerland, Portugal, Italy, USA, 
Australia). All studies included baseline data for 
socioeconomic status and a mortality follow-up of a 
minimum of 3 years. Each study was approved by the 
relevant local or national ethics committees and all 
participants gave informed consent to participate. We 
assessed the quality of included studies using the 
Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool for cohort studies.12 We 
analysed a selection of exposed and non-exposed groups, 
assessment of exposure, exclusion of the outcome of 
interest at study baseline, adjustment for con 
founding 
variables, 
assessment 
of 
confounding 
variables, 
assessment of outcome, and adequacy of the follow-up. 
Two reviewers (SS and MK) independently assessed the 
studies. The quality of the study was judged as high if all 
domains were assessed favourably (appendix).
Definitions and data collection
Our measure of socioeconomic status is a social class 
measure 
based 
on 
an 
individual’s 
last 
known 
occupational title at study enrolment, coded into the 
European Socio-economic Classification (ESEC). This 
variable was predefined and harmonised across the 
study cohorts before statistical analyses were done. 
Occupational position was categorised as high (higher 
professionals and managers, higher clerical, services, 
and sales workers [ESEC class 1, 2, and 3]), intermediate 
(small employers and self-employed, farmers, lower 
supervisors, and technicians [ESEC class 4, 5, and 6]), or 
low (lower clerical, services and sales workers, skilled 
workers, and semi-skilled and unskilled workers [ESEC 
class 7, 8, and 9]). For one study (E3N), occupational 
position was current occupation 2 years after baseline. 
We used ESEC as a classification because it eliminates 
the need to adjust for differences in earnings and 
standards of living across different national contexts. We 
used individual’s occupational class only because most 
cohorts did not collect information about partner’s 
occupation. This decision could have led to some 
misclassification of socioeconomic status particularly for 
older women with low labour force participation rates.
Each 25 × 25 risk factor comprised two or three 
categories to allow a balanced comparison with socio-
economic status, which was grouped into three categories 
(appendix). Self-reported smoking was categorised into 
current smoker, former smoker, and never smoked. 
Alcohol consumption was measured in alcohol units per 
week and participants were categorised as abstainers 
(0 units per week), moderate (1–21 units per week for

Research in context
Evidence before this study
Low socioeconomic status is one of the strongest predictors of 
morbidity and premature mortality worldwide. However, global 
health strategies do not consider poor socioeconomic 
circumstances as modifiable risk factors. The WHO Global Action 
Plan for the Prevention and Control of Non-Communicable 
Diseases, for example, targets seven major health risk factors, 
including insufficient physical activity, current tobacco use. and 
raised blood pressure, for reducing premature mortality from 
non-communicable diseases by 25% by 2025. Low socioeconomic 
status is not included among the 25 × 25 risk factors.
Added value of this study
We used data from more than 1·7 million individuals in 
48 independent cohort studies from seven countries, and 
found that the independent association between 
socioeconomic status and mortality is comparable in strength 
and consistency to those of six 25 × 25 risk factors (tobacco use, 
alcohol consumption, insufficient physical activity, raised blood 
pressure, obesity, diabetes). Our study is one of the largest 
studies to date to examine the association between 
socioeconomic status and premature mortality and the first 
large-scale investigation to directly compare the importance of 
socioeconomic circumstances as determinants of health with 
six major risk factors targeted in global health strategies for the 
reduction of premature mortality.
Implications of all the available evidence
By showing comparable health impact of low socioeconomic 
status to that of major risk factors, our study suggests that 
socioeconomic adversity should be included as a modifiable risk 
factor in local and global health strategies, policies, and 
health-risk surveillance.

men, 1–14 per week for women), or heavy (>21 units per 
week for men, >14 per week for women) drinkers. 
Although physical activity was measured with different 
questions in each study, a dichotomised variable 
indicating the presence or absence of physical activity 
was defined (appendix). Body-mass index (BMI) was 
categorised as normal (18·5–<25 kg/m²), overweight 
(25–<30 kg/m²), or obese (≥30 kg/m²). Hypertension 
was defined as the presence of at least one of the 
following conditions: systolic blood pressure more than 
140 mm Hg, diastolic blood pressure more than 
90 mm Hg, current intake of anti-hypertensive 
medication, or self-reported hyper 
tension. Diabetes was 
defined as the presence of at least one of the following 
conditions: fasting glucose more than 7 mmol/L, 2 h 
post-load 
glucose 
above 
11·1 
mmol/L, 
glycated 
haemoglobin A1c more than 6·5%, or self-reported 
diabetes. Data for salt intake were only available from 
less than a third of the cohort studies; we therefore 
omitted this risk factor from our analysis.
We considered age, sex, race or ethnicity, and marital 
status as potential confounders. Race or ethnicity was 
categorised as white and non-white individuals. Marital 
status was categorised as married or cohabiting versus 
living alone.
Participants were linked to national mortality registries 
that provided information about vital status with the 
exception of the COLAUS study in which vital status was 
ascertained through active follow-up. Mean follow-up for 
mortality ranged between 3·2 years in the National 
Health Interview Survey 2009, and 27·0 years in men and 
29·5 years in women of the Alameda County Study 1965, 
with a mean across cohorts of 13·3 years [SD 6·4 years]. 
All-cause mortality, cancer mortality, cardio 
vascular 
disease mortality, and mortality from other causes of 
death were examined separately. We focus on cancer and 
cardiovascular disease as these diseases are the most 
common causes of death in our samples. We used codes 
from the International Classification of Diseases, 10th 
Revision (ICD-10) to define cancer (C00–C97) and 
cardiovascular disease (I00–I99) mortality. Other causes 
of death include all remaining deaths not classified as 
cancer or cardiovascular disease.
Statistical analysis
Analyses were first performed separately in each study; 
estimates were subsequently combined in a meta-
analytical framework. In study-specific analyses, we 
considered the maximum number of participants 
without missing values for each exposure. To estimate 
the association between risk factors and mortality, hazard 
ratios (HR) and 95% CIs were generated using flexible 
parametric survival models on the cumulative hazards 
scale,13 which, in addition to the HRs, allow direct 
estimation of the conditional cumulative hazard function. 
Within these models, we used restricted cubic splines 
with 0 to 4 (depending on the cohort) internal knots to 
model the baseline hazard using age as the timescale. 
Separate models were fitted for men and women and 
included marital status and race or ethnicity (minimally 
adjusted models). To check for the proportional hazard 
assumption, we performed tests based on Schoenfeld 
residuals and inspected log-log plots of Kaplan-Meier 
curves. Age stratification in 5-year intervals was 
conducted in all cohorts as a sensitivity analysis to adjust 
for age calendar effects (results not shown).
In further analyses combining men and women, we 
examined the association of socioeconomic status with 
cause-specific mortality before and after adjustment for 
the 25 × 25 risk factors. The mutually adjusted models 
included age, sex, race or ethnicity, marital status, 
socioeconomic status, and all 25 × 25 risk factors as 
independent variables with total mortality and deaths 
from cardiovascular disease, cancer, and other causes as 
outcomes. To enable balanced comparisons between 
socioeconomic status and 25 × 25 risk factors as 
predictors of cause-specific mortality, these analyses 
were restricted to a subgroup of participants with 
complete data for socioeconomic status and the 
25 × 25 risk factors.
To examine whether the association between socio-
economic status and mortality is attributable to the 
higher prevalence of the 25 × 25 risk factors among low 
socioeconomic status individuals, we repeated the 
analyses in a subgroup of participants without any 
25 × 25 risk factors. Analyses were also repeated 
specifically focusing on premature mortality (<70 years) 
and by restricting the population to cohorts in which 
height and weight as well as blood pressure were 
measured objectively using standard procedures.
To further evaluate the effects of socioeconomic status 
and the 25 × 25 risk factors on mortality, we computed the 
population 
attributable 
fraction. 
The 
population 
attributable fraction is based on the HR and the 
proportion of participants exposed assuming the 
association between exposure and outcome is causal.14 
The variance of population attributable fraction was 
estimated via bootstrapping using 1000 independent 
replications. The proportion of participants exposed 
(prevalence) was calculated as the mean prevalence 
across all cohorts for each risk factor.
YLLs were calculated as the difference of the areas 
under the survival curves (from age 40 years to 85 years) 
comparing the population exposed to a given risk factor 
with the reference population with no exposure. Area 
under the curve was computed via numerical integration 
with a spline-based method. Life expectancies were 
estimated conditional on survival to age 40 years. In view 
of the truncation at age 85 years, the theoretical maximal 
life expectancy at 40 years old is 45 years. Variance 
of YLLs was estimated via bootstrapping using 
1000 independent replications.
Study-specific HRs, PAF, and YLLs estimates were 
meta-analysed using the Hartung-Knapp random-effects

method.15 To assess heterogeneity between cohorts, we 
computed I² and τ² statistics; I² to assess heterogeneity 
attributable to variation in the true association and τ² to 
measure the inter-cohort variance. To account for τ² in 
the uncertainty around the pooled estimates, we further 
calculated 95% prediction intervals for hazard ratios.16
Role of the funding source
The funding sources had no role in the study design; in 
the collection, analysis, and interpretation of data; in the 
writing of the report; or in the decision to submit the 
paper for publication. CC and MJ had full access to the 
datasets. SS, PV, and MK had final responsibility for the 
decision to submit for publication.
Results
48 studies were included (appendix). After excluding 
27 392 (1·5%) of 1 778 871 participants who had missing 
data for the covariates or mortality, 1 751 479 participants 
were included in the analysis (appendix). Mean age at 
study entry was 47·8 years (SD 14·8) and 54% of 
participants were women. The proportion of par-
ticipants with low occupational position ranged from 
6·9% to 66·9% across studies (mean 41·4% [SD 12·5] 
for men and 27·1% [SD 14·9] for women). The 
proportion of people with a high occupational position 
varied between 5·9% and 84·8% (mean 32·5% [SD 
11·7] men and 26·1% [SD 12·3] women). Age 
stratification revealed no age calendar effects (data not 
shown).
During 12 025 208 person-years at risk for men, 
161 524 men died; during 14 580 862 person-years at risk 
for women, a total of 148 753 women died (mean follow-
up for men and women 13·3 years [SD 3·4]). In men, 
43 765 (15·2% of total) with low occupational position 
died and 17 160 (11·5%) with high occupational position 
died. In women, 11 835 (9·4% of total) with low 
occupational position died and 8292 (6·8%) with high 
occupational position died. Participants with low 
occupational position had a higher mortality risk than 
did those with high occupational position, in both men 
(HR 1·42, 95% CI 1·38–1·45; figure 1) and women 
(1·34, 1·28–1·39; figure 2). Participants with inter-
mediate occupational position had a higher mortality 
risk compared with participants with high occupational 
position (meta-analytic HR 1·21, 95% CI 1·18–1·24 for 
men and 1·17, 1·12–1·22 for women). A graded 
association between occupational position and mortality 
was observed in both men and women (HR for one unit 
decrease in SES 1·19, 95% CI 1·17–1·20 in men and 
1·15, 1·13–1·18 in women, p<0·0001 for both). 
Heterogeneity in study-specific estimates was low for 
men (I²=14·5% [0–41%], p=0·2034, τ²=0·0008) and 
moderate for women (I²=29·8% [0–51·2%], p=0·0309, 
τ²=0·0048).
Figure 3 shows mortality associated with the 25 × 25 risk 
factors (minimally adjusted models). The greatest 
increases in mortality associated with the 25 × 25 risk 
factors were for current smoking and diabetes, although 
physical inactivity, high alcohol intake, and hypertension 
were also associated (figure 3). The effect of low 
occupational position appeared greater than that of 
hypertension or obesity (figure 3); the effect of low 
occupational position on mortality was greater than that 
of obesity even when the obesity analysis was restricted 
to cohorts with a mean follow-up more than 10 years 
(>10 years; HR 1·12, 95% CI 1·05–1·21 for men and 1·24, 
1·18–1·31 for women). 33 of 48 studies had complete

and had cause-specific mortality data, for a total of 
275 973 participants with 21 923 deaths during the follow-
up (figure 4). The association between low socioeconomic 
status and mortality was consistent across causes of 
death and remained significant in the minimally adjusted 
models and the mutually adjusted models (figure 4). The 
highest minimally adjusted HR was current smoking 
(figure 4).
We assessed the PAF for socioeconomic status and the 
25 × 25 risk factors, assuming the associations with 
mortality are causal and that the risk could be reduced to 
the level of the most favourable category for each factor 
(figure 5). We estimated the achievable reduction in 
mortality during the follow-up period should the death 
risk in the whole population equate that of high 
occupational position or the reference group for each of 
the 25 × 25 risk factors. The PAF for low SES was 18·94% 
(95% CI 17·63–20·24) for men and 15·33% (12·76–17·90) 
for women. The highest PAF was for smoking for men 
(29·04%, 26·90–31·18) and for physical inactivity for 
women (23·41%, 20·42–26·39).
In men and women combined, partial life expectancy 
at 40 years was reduced by more than 2 years because of 
low 
socioeconomic 
status 
(figure 
6). 
All 
other 
25 × 25 factors assessed were associated with decreased 
life expectancy, apart from BMI (figure 6).
Additional sensitivity analyses including only western 
European cohorts, restricting the analysis to premature 
mortality (<70 years), to a subset of participants without 
the 25 × 25 risk factors (HR for low SES vs high SES 1·26, 
95% CI 1·12–1·42), and to high quality studies or to 
cohorts with height and weight or blood pressure 
measured using standard procedures, yielded similar 
results (appendix).
Discussion
We used individual-level data from more than 1·7 million 
individuals in 48 independent cohort studies to compare 
the association of low socio 
economic status with 
mortality to those of six WHO 25 × 25 risk factor targets 
for the reduction of premature mortality. We found that 
the independent association between socioeconomic 
status and mortality is com 
parable in strength and 
consistency across countries to those for the 25 × 25 risk 
factors. Low socioeconomic status was associated with 
2·1 YLLs between ages 40 and 85 years, while the 
corresponding years of life lost were 0·5 for high alcohol 
intake, 0·7 for obesity, 3·9 for diabetes, 1·6 for hyper-
tension, 2·4 for physical inactivity and 4·8 for current 
smoking in men and women combined. These findings 
are largely consistent with previous studies,17–19 which 
used income or education as a measure of socioeconomic 
status.
The strong influence of socioeconomic factors on 
health, morbidity and mortality is well established,3,20–25 
with studies showing a widening in inequalities in 
mortality22,25 despite absolute inequalities falling in some 
countries.22,23 Our study is one of the largest to examine 
the effect of low socioeconomic status on premature 
mortality and is to our knowledge the first large-scale 
study to directly compare the importance of socio-
economic circumstances as determinants of health with 
the six major risk factors targeted in global health 
strategies for the reduction of premature mortality. The 
association between low socioeconomic status and 
premature mortality was consistent across causes of 
death, whereas the 25 × 25 risk factors were generally 
more strongly associated with cardiovascular disease 
mortality than with cancer and with mortality of 
other causes.

We used occupational position as a proxy of 
socioeconomic status and social circumstances in 
general. This measure is one of the most commonly 
used indicators of socioeconomic status, data for this 
indicator were widely available across the cohort studies 
included in our analysis and occupational position is 
comparable between countries. Occupational position 
also has the advantage of reducing reverse causality—we 
assessed last known occupation, which is less likely to 
change with illness than is one’s income. However, 
socio 
economic status is a complex factor that comprises 
several dimensions and by using a single indicator of 
socioeconomic status we might have underestimated its 
full effect on mortality. Addressing several components 
of socioeconomic status (ie, low occupational position, 
income poverty, low education) could be important for 
population health improvement.
This study has some important limitations. First, risk 
factors (ie, hypertension, physical activity, obesity, and 
diabetes) are interconnected making it difficult to 
establish their independent contribution. For example, 
low socioeconomic status might induce changes in one 
or more risk factors, but risk factors for chronic diseases 
might also reduce labour supply and earnings, thereby 
lowering socioeconomic status. Furthermore, factors 
other than those considered in the 25 × 25 list could be 
involved in the pathways between socioeconomic status 
and mortality. In view of these complex relationships, 
our estimates of the population attributable fraction, 
assuming unidirectional causal associations, should be 
interpreted with caution. Second, different measures of 
socioeconomic status can themselves be intertwined, 
and can influence risk factors for health or disease at 
different points over a person’s life. For example, 
increased educational levels might contribute to 
increased life expectancy via multiple pathways 
including better occupational position, higher income, 
less smoking, reduced occupational hazard, more 
physical activity, healthier diet, increased self-care, and 
adherence to medical treatments.26 However, the 
finding that socioeconomic status is associated with 
death risk independently of conventional risk factors 
suggests that both socioeconomic adversity and 
25 × 25 risk factors should be targeted by health 
strategies. Third, with broad two-level or three-level 
categorisations, the assessment of both socioeconomic 
status and risk factors was crude, potentially 
underestimating the strength of associations with 
mortality outcomes. However, the comparison between 
risk factors should be balanced because they were all 
measured with the same relative level of precision. The 
observed associations of smoking, physical activity, 
high alcohol intake, diabetes, and hypertension with 
mortality were comparable with those of previous 
studies.27–30 The non-significant outcome observed 
between obesity and all-cause mortality in men might 
be an underestimate due to pre-existing morbidity

leading to weight loss and increased mortality risk 
among lean or underweight individuals.31,32 Hetero-
geneity in study-specific estimates was generally low 
for occupational position, but larger for some of the 
risk factors (appendix). This difference could be due to 
varying degrees of precision in the measurement of the 
25 × 25 risk factors in the different cohorts, and random-
effect meta-analysis partially takes this uncertainty into 
account 
for 
the 
estimation 
of 
pooled 
effects. 
Finally, the cohort studies participating in the 
LIFEPATH 
consortium 
were 
from 
high-income 
countries. Thus, our results might not be generalisable 
to other populations. Previous studies suggest that 
socio 
economic factors and the 25 × 25 risk factors are 
also strong predictors of premature mortality in low 
and middle income countries.33 Further research should 
assess socioeconomic status and 25 × 25 risk factors in 
predicting mortality in different economic settings.
Despite these limitations, our study has important 
implications. Our findings suggest that existing global 
strategies and actions defined in the 25 × 25 health plan 
and the Global Burden of Diseases surveillance 
programme potentially exclude a major determinant of 
health from the agenda. A lack of consideration of the 
interrelation between social circumstances and health is 
also evident in the Sustainable Development Goals 
(SDGs): SDG 3 focuses on health but it makes no 
mention of the role of social circumstances. Similarly, 
SDG 1 and 4 focus on the elimination of poverty and the 
achievement of universal primary education but they do 
not mention reducing health inequalities as an explicit 
goal. Similar to the risk factors targeted by existing 
global health strategies, socioeconomic circumstances 
are modifiable by policies at the local, national, and 
international levels,26,34 through interventions such as 
promotion of early childhood development, poverty 
reduction, improve 
ments to access to high-quality 
education, enacting of compulsory schooling laws, and 
creation of safe home, school, and work environments.8,9 
Over the past decade, socioeconomic factors have 
started making their way into international agencies 
and global reports, as evidenced in the report of the 
WHO Commission on the Social Determinants of 
Health (CSDH) in 200826 and in the Rio Political 
Declaration on the Social Determinants of Health.35 
Although these efforts have raised awareness of 
socioeconomic inequalities in health, global prevention 
strategies still appear to be centred on the treatment of 
proximal risk factors. Such approaches fail to address 
powerful upstream structural solutions such as 
investment in early education programmes for children 
(allowing parents to work while their children are cared 
for) and work incentive programmes (ie, earned income 
tax credit) that might be a cost-effective way to reduce 
inequalities 
in 
health.10,36–38 
By 
showing 
low 
socioeconomic status has a comparable health effect to 
that of major risk factors, the results of our study 
suggest that socio 
economic circumstances, in addition 
to the 25 × 25 factors, should be treated as a target for 
local 
and 
global 
health 
strategies, 
health 
risk 
surveillance, interventions, and policy.
