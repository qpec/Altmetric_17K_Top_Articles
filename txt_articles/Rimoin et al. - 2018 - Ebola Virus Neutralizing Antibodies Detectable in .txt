The first reported outbreak of Ebola virus disease occurred in 1976 in Yambuku, Democratic Republic of Congo. Antibody responses 
in survivors 11 years after infection have been documented. However, this report is the first characterization of anti-Ebola virus anti-
body persistence and neutralization capacity 40 years after infection. Using ELISAs we measured survivor’s immunological response 
to Ebola virus Zaire (EBOV) glycoprotein and nucleoprotein, and assessed VP40 reactivity. Neutralization of EBOV was measured 
using a pseudovirus approach and plaque reduction neutralization test with live EBOV. Some survivors from the original EBOV out-
break still harbor antibodies against all 3 measures. Interestingly, a subset of these survivors’ serum antibodies could still neutralize 
live virus 40 years postinitial infection. These data provide the longest documentation of both anti-Ebola serological response and 
neutralization capacity within any survivor cohort, extending the known duration of response from 11 years postinfection to at least 
40 years after symptomatic infection.

Ebolavirus Zaire, abbreviated herein as EBOV
, a member of the 
Filoviridae family, is a highly virulent pathogen that is often asso-
ciated with high mortality rates in humans [1]. Outbreaks have 
occurred with increasing frequency throughout Central and 
Western Africa, with mortality rates ranging from 25% to 90% 
[2–5]. EBOV is spread via direct or indirect transmission through 
contact with bodily fluids such as vomit, blood, and diarrhea. 
Transmission can be halted with early diagnosis, effective surveil-
lance with contact tracing, patient isolation, and safe burial prac-
tices [5]. However, the failure of quarantine methods in the recent 
West African outbreak have highlighted the fragility of health 
infrastructures and the urgency to better understand the ecology 
of EBOV and develop targeted and effective viral therapies [6].
The first documented outbreak of Ebola virus disease (EVD) 
caused by EBOV occurred in 1976 in the northwestern part 
of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC, formerly Zaire) 
[2, 7]. The index case was a 44-year-old man who was treated at 
Yambuku hospital for epistaxis, dysentery, and fever. Between 
August 26 and November 5, 318 cases were recorded, resulting 
in 280 deaths, and 38 serologically confirmed survivors, with a 
case-fatality rate of 88%. The factors associated with transmis-
sion included receipt of injection with a reusable syringe, and 
close contact with an acute EVD case [2]. Six additional out-
breaks have since occurred in DRC between 1977 and 2014 [8], 
and in May of 2017 there was yet another Ebola outbreak that 
occurred within the Likati Health Zone, a region just 150 km 
away from where the 1976 outbreak occurred (Figure 1).
The duration of immunity against EBOV among survivors 
still remains unclear, although Natesan et al [9] (Ebola virus 
Sudan, Ebola virus Bundibugyo, and Marburg virus) and 
Corti et al [10] (Ebola virus Zaire, Kikwit outbreak) have both 
demonstrated that antibodies specific to Filoviridae are main-
tained in survivors up to 11 years postinfection. The duration 
of antibody response and neutralization potentials in survi-
vors who were infected more than 11 years prior is unknown. 
While documentation of long-term antibody maintenance in 
Ebola survivors remains limited, others have demonstrated that 
antibody presence against other viruses such as Lassa can be

retained for significant durations of time [11]. Furthermore, no 
retrospective characterization of the immunological responses 
in survivors of the 1976 Yambuku outbreak has been previously 
reported. To investigate this, we obtained blood samples from 
14 remaining survivors infected during the 1976 Yambuku out-
break, to assess the serological immune profile and retention of 
EBOV neutralizing antibodies 40 years postinfection, providing 
the longest documentation of such measures in EVD cases.
METHODS
In January 2016, 14 survivors from the 1976 Yambuku EVD 
outbreak were identified using DRC Ministry of Health reports. 
Six of the identified participants were considered confirmed 
cases and enrolled in the plasmapheresis study conducted after 
1976, with symptoms and molecular analyses that were con-
sidered positive at the time [12]. The remaining 8 participants 
were suspected cases based on Ministry of Health reports along 
with in-person interviews, and confirmation from health-care 
workers present during the outbreak. Participants were asked to 
complete a detailed questionnaire, which included demographic 
characteristics, health history, current health status, and expo-
sure to wildlife and potentially infected humans. Upon review 
of the questionnaire responses, all 14 survivors reported symp-
toms of EVD (fever or unexplained bleeding or any three of the 
following: headache, myalgia, rash, vomiting, diarrhea, hiccups, 
breathing problems, or difficulty swallowing [13]) during the 
outbreak between August and November 1976. Study partici-
pants were also asked to complete a physical assessment, which 
included weight, height, and blood pressure. Blood specimens 
were obtained from participants by venipuncture in vacutainer 
tubes (BD Biosciences). After processing, aliquots of serum, 
plasma and buffy coat were frozen and stored in a liquid nitrogen 
dry shipper at the Institut National de Recherche Biomedicale in 
Kinshasa and shipped to collaborating institutions.

immunosorbent

(ELISA) 
kit 
(Alpha 
Diagnostic 
International, Inc.) following the manufacture’s protocol. 
Optical density values at 450 nm (OD450) were recorded for 
each sample at a 1:250 dilution in duplicate. A sample was 
determined mildly reactive if the serum antibody concentration 
was greater than 1.0 Units/mL of the purified IgG control cali-
brator. The sample was considered strongly reactive if they har-
bored titers greater than 5 Units/mL, a more conservative cutoff 
than what was used in previous reports, where a 4.7 U/mL 
 
cutoff yielded 96.7% sensitivity and 97.7% specificity [14].
Human anti-EBOV Zaire nucleoprotein (NP) titers were 
measured using commercially available ELISA kits (Alpha 
Diagnostics International) and were performed in San 
Francisco, CA. The assays were performed following the man-
ufacturer’s instructions at a 1:200 sample dilution in duplicate 
and the absorbance was read at 450 nm. A sample was deter-
mined mildly reactive if the serum antibody concentration was 
greater than the 1.0 Units/mL control calibrator and strongly 
reactive if they harbored titers greater than 5 Units/mL.
Luciferase Immunoprecipitation System
The C-terminal domain of Mayinga EBOV Zaire viral protein 
40 (VP40; bp 583–981) was cloned into the pRen2 plasmid 
and transfected into Cos-1 cells generating Renilla luciferase 
antigen fusion proteins. Cell lysates were harvested and used 
in immunoprecipitation assays with Protein A/G conjugated 
agarose beads as described by Burbelo et al [15]. In the final 
step, the beads were washed 4 times with buffer A and 1 time 
with phosphate buffered saline using a vacuum manifold before 
measuring luciferase activities using the Renilla luciferase assay 
system substrate (Promega). VP40 positivity was determined 
if the relative luciferase signal postimmunoprecipitation was 
at least 3 standard deviations greater than the background sig-
nal, as determined from an average of 8 previously identified 
negative serum samples. Positive controls were obtained from 
human convalescent patient sera collected during the 2014 
Boende, DRC, EBOV outbreak [16]. Data are presented as rela-
tive light units (RLU) of patient over RLU of negative controls; 
values greater than 1, are considered positive.
Pseudotype Virus Neutralization Assay
Pseudotype viruses were generated as described previously [17] by 
using 25 μg Mayinga Zaire Ebola virus glycoprotein (EBOV-GP) 
[18] or, as a negative control, vesicular stomatitis virus glyco-
protein (VSV-G) [19] expression plasmids, respectively, and 
10 μg pNL-Luc viral backbone obtained through the NIH AIDS 
Reagent Program, Division of AIDS, NIAID, NIH (catalog #3418) 
[20]. The pseudotypes contained in the culture supernatant were 
pelleted through a 20% sucrose cushion by ultracentrifugation for 
1.5 hours at 4°C and 27 000 rpm in a SW-28 rotor and the viral 
pellet resuspended in 1/100 volume of Hank’s buffered saline solu-
tion (HBSS) overnight at 4°C. The pseudotype virus stocks were 
aliquoted and stored at −80°C. Pseudotype viruses were titered 
on  human rhabdomyosarcoma (RD) cells to determine the vol-
ume required to yield 104 RLU luciferase activity in cell lysates 48 
hours postinfection. Two pseudotype virus neutralization assays 
were performed as previously described [21]. Pseudotype virus 
was incubated with serial dilutions of sera (1:50, 1:250, 1:1250, 
1:6250) before infection of RD cells. All infections were completed 
in duplicate wells and each plate contained identical controls, 
including uninfected cells, cells infected in absence of serum, and 
cells infected in presence of negative control serum (US donor) 
or positive control serum from a recent, confirmed Ebola sur-
vivor. Infection rates in presence of human serum samples were 
expressed as percentage of infection in presence of negative con-
trol serum. To determine neutralizing capability, serum from the 
patients had to at least neutralize approximately 50% of virus com-
pared to appropriate control.
EBOV-like Particle Entry Inhibition Assay
EBOV Zaire-like particles (VLPs) produced using VP40-
GLucN were prepared as previously described [22] and used in a 
G-Luciferase (GLuc) complementation assay for entry inhibition. 
VLPs were incubated with serial dilutions of sera (1:50, 1:250, 
1:1250, 1:6250) before spin-infection of target cells (RD cells 
transiently expressing GLucC), in duplicate. GLuc activity in cell 
lysates was measured using a commercial kit (Pierce) according 
to the manufacturer’s instructions and expressed as percentage of 
luciferase activity in the presence of negative control serum.
Plaque Reduction Neutralizing Test 50% and 80%
The plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT50 or 80) is a 
neutralization assay in which live virus is incubated in the pres-
ence of serial dilutions of test samples under BSL-4 contain-
ment conditions. The virus/sample mixture is then incubated 
with cells, and nonneutralized virus infects cell monolayers. 
The antibody titer can be calculated by comparing the number 
of virus plaques in each sample dilution well to the virus-only 
control wells (no test sample). Samples were serial diluted (1:2) 
in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM) over a range 
of 1:30 to 1:10240, mixed at a 1:1:1 ratio with the C05 isolate 
of Ebola Makona and either complement (Cedar Lane Labs 
standard guinea pig complement) or media and incubated at 
37°C with 5% CO2 for 1 hour. Following incubation, 300 µL of 
virus/serum inoculum was added to triplicate wells of a 6-well 
plate containing 90%–100% confluent Vero E6 cells and rocked 
every 15 minutes for 1 hour. Following incubation, 2 mL of 
overlay (1.25% Avicel in minimal essential media) was added 
to each well before incubation at 37°C with 5% CO2 for 8 days. 
After incubation, the overlay was removed, and the cell mono-
layers fixed for 30 minutes at room temperature with 1 mL of 
a 0.2% crystal violet solution in 10% neutral-buffered forma-
lin. The plates were washed with tap water and dried, and the 
total number of plaque forming units (PFUs) were counted and 
recorded for each well. An anti-Ebola virus antibody from IBT 
Bioservices (#01-0004) was used as a positive control for each

assay. The PRNT50 was calculated by identifying the first dilu-
tion with 50% or 80% fewer plaques compared to the average 
number of plaques observed in virus-only wells.
Cells
Human embryonic kidney 293T, human muscle RD, and 
African green monkey COS-1 cells were grown in Dulbecco’s 
modified essential medium (Hyclone) supplemented with 10% 
fetal bovine serum, l-glutamine, nonessential amino acids, and 
antibiotics penicillin and streptomycin (all Gibco) and incu-
bated at 37°C with 5% CO2. For PRNT50 assays: African green 
monkey kidney cells (VERO C1008 (E6), ATCC, CRL-1586) 
were maintained in DMEM high glucose with l-glutamine 
(Lonza 12-604Q) containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine 
serum (Sigma Life Sciences, F2442). The cells were seeded one 
day prior at 4 × 104 cells/well in 96-well plates (Greiner bio-one 
655948) and 1 × 106 cells/well in 6-well plates (Corning 3506), 
respectively, and incubated at 37°C with 5% CO2.
Statistical Methods
Univariate analysis was performed for categorical variables 
using χ2 or Fisher’s exact test, as appropriate using SAS software, 
Version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).
Ethical approval was obtained at UCLA Fielding School of 
Public Health and the Kinshasa School of Public Health.
RESULTS
Study Population
Fourteen individuals were identified as survivors of the 1976 
EBOV outbreak in Yambuku, DRC. Data on survivor character-
istics are presented in Table 1. Eight participants were male and 
6 were female, ranging from 55 to 86 years of age (between 15 
and 46 years of age at the time of infection). Six of these individ-
uals were classified as confirmed EBOV cases and the additional 
8 were classified as suspected cases based on the DRC Ministry 
of Health records obtained from the original outbreak investi-
gation of 1976–77 [2]. Ethical approval was obtained from all 
participating institutions and informed consent was obtained 
from all participants in local language.

 Ebola Virus Neutralizing Antibodies in Survivors  • JID 2018:217 (15 January) • 227
(ES-1, 2, 3, 5, 11, 12, and 13), exhibited mild to moderate reac-
tivity to EBOV GP with titers >1 U/mL and 5 survivors (ES-4, 
6, 8, 9, and 14) were considered strongly reactive with a titer 
>5 U/mL, as measured by the commercially available ADI 
GP ELISA using a serum dilution factor of 1:200 (Figure 2A). 
When assessing reactivity to NP, we identified 5 survivors (ES-
4, 5, 8, 13, and 14) who exhibited strong immunoreactivity, with 
a titer above 5 U/mL and 8 survivors (ES-1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 9, 10, 
and 11), with mild to moderate responses (titers > 1 U/mL), as 
measured by the ADI NP ELISA using a serum dilution factor 
of 1:200(Figure 2B). There were far fewer survivors exhibiting 
reactivity against VP40, with only 3 individuals that were con-
sidered to be immunoreactive (Figure 2C).
EBOV Pseudovirus Neutralization Assays
Once it was established that 100% of our study cohort were sero-
positive for EBOV GP, NP, or VP40, we next assessed if the reac-
tive individuals were also capable of neutralizing virus. Three 
survivors (ES-4, 5, and 8) demonstrated capacity to neutralize 
the pseudovirus >50% using a serum dilution factor of 1:50. 
Using Ebola VLPs in a GLuc entry inhibition assay, which are 
thought to more closely mimic live EBOV in regards to eliciting 
immunological responses and protection [15, 23, 24], we found 
that 3 survivors (ES-4, 8, and 10) were capable of neutraliza-
tion (>50%) and one (ES-5) demonstrated borderline capacity 
to neutralize in both assays (50.40% and 49.91%) again using 
a serum dilution factor of 1:50. Collectively, between these 2 
assays, 4 survivors (29.0%) were identified as retaining neutral-
izing antibodies (Figure 3).
Plaque Reduction Neutralization Test Using Live EBOV
After the establishment that a subset of survivors 40 years after 
initial infection showed neutralization capabilities using pseu-
do-type viral assays, we next sought to test neutralization capac-
ity using live EBOV. Four survivors (ES-4, 8, 12, and 13) were 
able to neutralize live virus using a PRNT, 2 of which (ES-4 
and 8) demonstrated strong neutralization using the pseudo-
virus assay, as well as strong reactivity in 2 or 3 anti-EBOV IgG 
assays, using recombinant viral proteins. Subjects ES-4 and 13 
neutralized EBOV to at least 50% using a 1:30 dilution with 
complement proteins inactivated, while subject ES-8 showed 
even stronger trends, neutralizing 50% at 1:60 dilution and 80% 
at 1:30 dilution with complement proteins inactivated. Despite 
the inability to neutralize pseudovirus, our PRNT revealed that 
subject ES-12 neutralized live EBOV to at least 50% of control 
at a 1:120 serum dilution with nonactive compliment proteins. 
It should be noted, however, that the neutralization curve is 
atypical for ES-12, which may indicate that this patient simply 
exhibited nonspecific inhibition, or toxicity, as opposed to actu-
ally having specific EBOV neutralization capabilities (Figure 4).

DISCUSSION
The recent EVD outbreak highlights the need to develop effective 
therapeutics or vaccines that limit pathogenesis and viral spread. 
Currently, there is a growing body of evidence that offers hope 
for finding ways to pharmacologically mimic or boost the natu-
ral resistance that some individuals appear to have towards EBOV 
infection. Viral proteins play a key role in host–virus interactions 
in EBOV infection [25] and the GP is the major determinant 
of entry and cellular tropism, an important protein involved in 
pathogenesis [14], and the primary target for protective immu-
nity. However, in addition to GP
, NP or other viral proteins could 
individually or synergistically constitute effective targets for future 
vaccine therapy [26]. Studies of EVD survivors may provide crit-
ical data to inform strategies for mimicking the resilience, which 
some individuals have demonstrated when infected with EBOV
.
Here we describe the first documentation of live EBOV 
neutralizing antibody persistence within a subset of the oldest 
known EVD survivors, 40 years after acute EBOV infection. 
Additionally, these data represent the longest documented 
serological response to individual recombinant Ebola viral pro-
teins (GP, NP, and VP40) and live EBOV. Until now, the longest 
duration of antibody responses to EBOV infection measured 
had been 11 years [9], thus our study provides evidence that 
antibody responses against EBOV can be long-lived and extend 
significantly further beyond known filovirus infections than 
previously documented. While the number of available sur-
vivors from this outbreak is limited, this is the only study to 
our knowledge that examines long-term immune response to 
EBOV in survivors on this time scale.
Despite the identifying levels of GP (12/14) and NP (13/14) 
reactivity in our study cohort (>1 U/mL), we only identified 
3/14 survivors as retaining immunoreactivity to VP40. These 
findings are comparable to an earlier study of serological 
responses to the related Sudan Ebola virus (EBOV-S), suggest-
ing that VP40 appears to be less commonly immunogenic than 
GP or NP [27]. As a gold standard, live EBOV neutralization 
was measured using a PRNT to determine if these EVD survi-
vor samples could neutralize actual virus in vitro 40 years after 
infection. Four (29%) survivors had anti-Ebola neutralizing 
titers, 2 of which also demonstrated strong neutralization using 
the pseudovirus assay. As noted, the PRNT curve for ES-12 
is atypical, raising the possibility that the mode of neutraliza-
tion for this particular survivor may not be EBOV specific, but 
rather nonspecific inhibition. Of the 4 survivors with neutraliz-
ing antibodies, all reacted to viral protein GP, with survivors 4 
and 8 being considered strongly reactive, and survivors 12 and 
13 considered mildly reactive. Three survivors reacted strongly 
to NP (ES-4, 8, and 13), with one PRNT neutralizer showing 
no response to this recombinant protein. The 2 survivors (ES-8 
and 13) with the highest neutralization capacity on the PRNT 
demonstrated reactivity to VP40.
Unlike other studies that have shown that human sera con-
taining Mannose-binding lectin can enhance instances of 
neutralization of EBOV and MARV pseudovirus [28], here it 
appears that compliment did not have any significant effect 
on enhancing antibody-mediated EBOV neutralization capac-
ity. More work will be necessary to accurately assess the best 
measures for predicting neutralization, as there is variability 
in neutralizer response to GP, NP, and VP40. However, as an 
initial screen, those who are NP and GP reactive appear more 
likely to neutralize the virus in downstream applications. Given 
that within this study cohort, the majority of survivors react at 
least mildly to GP, yet are unable to neutralize may indicate that 
GP response is not necessarily the best indicator of downstream 
neutralization. Additionally, 1 of the strongest PRNT neutraliz-
ers had extremely low response to GP, yet high responses to NP 
and VP40. However, it is also important to note that protective 
antibodies are not necessarily always neutralizing using in vitro 
assays [29], and leads to the possibility that in vivo, our survi-
vor cohort may all be protected from reinfection, because there 
have not been documented cases of reinfection with EBOV.
Given the small sample size, we were not able to find any 
significant trends in symptoms reported, exposure routes, or 
other demographic factors that predicted neutralizing antibody 
response 40 years postinfection. However, these results agree 
with previous studies, which have found known survivors har-
boring detectable antibodies against viral proteins or full virus 
antigen [9, 10, 27]. Interestingly, survivor ES-8, whose sera 
demonstrated the greatest ability to neutralize live virus, was the

only health-care worker enrolled in our study, indicating that 
these types of individuals should be investigated in greater depth 
during future research. Questionnaire data from this individual 
indicated multiple exposures to Ebola during the outbreak, with 
percutaneous exposure as well as contact with patient bodily 
fluids. The high levels of immunoreactivity seen in other indi-
viduals may also be the result of re-exposure through asympto-
matic, endogenous, or sylvatic sources in an endemic region [25, 
30, 31], although as mentioned, human reinfection with EBOV 
has not been documented. Another possibility is that related 
viruses may also stimulate EBOV humoral immunity, enabling 
this continued protective response observed in some survivors 
[27]. Alternatively, these individuals may have inherent genetic or 
regulatory differences that enable them to retain EBOV response 
and neutralization capabilities long after initial infection, whereas 
others lose this ability at a more rapid rate. Irrespective of mech-
anism, these survivors with specific, potent, and enduring immu-
nological responses may guide beneficial research in preventing 
or treating EVD in inevitable future reoccurrences.
Participants in this study represent the long-term survivors 
of EVD from the 1976 Yambuku outbreak, those that survived 
long enough to be included in this study, which may not be a 
representative sample of survivors from this first documented 
outbreak. However, these individuals are the only known living 
survivors of the first recorded EBOV outbreak in history and 
represent a unique and highly important cohort, enabling 
the opportunity to glean insight into the long-term immune 
response against this potent pathogen. Life expectancy of this 
population is among the lowest in the world (58 for males, 62 
for females) [32], and to find survivors 40 years after one of 
the deadliest Ebola outbreaks recorded presented numerous 
challenges, yet better than expected outcomes. This is an aging 
cohort and the aperture for studies of this nature is rapidly clos-
ing. Additional studies of the Yambuku survivors may provide 
an understanding of the health challenges that will face the sur-
vivors from the large West African Ebola outbreak.
This report documents anti-Ebola immunity to viral antigens 
40 years after the initial infection, but, most interestingly, we 
demonstrate that a subset of these survivors are still capable of 
neutralizing live virus. The duration of the anti-Ebola humoral 
response fills a knowledge gap within the field and provides evi-
dence that infection with EBOV can trigger a life-long humoral 
immune response, and in instances neutralize live virus in vitro.
