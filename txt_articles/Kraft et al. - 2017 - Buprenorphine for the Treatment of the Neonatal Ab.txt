BACKGROUND
Current pharmacologic treatment of the neonatal abstinence syndrome with mor-
phine is associated with a lengthy duration of therapy and hospitalization. Buprenor-
phine may be more effective than morphine for this indication.
METHODS
In this single-site, double-blind, double-dummy clinical trial, we randomly as-
signed 63 term infants (≥37 weeks of gestation) who had been exposed to opioids 
in utero and who had signs of the neonatal abstinence syndrome to receive either 
sublingual buprenorphine or oral morphine. Infants with symptoms that were not 
controlled with the maximum dose of opioid were treated with adjunctive pheno-
barbital. The primary end point was the duration of treatment for symptoms of 
neonatal opioid withdrawal. Secondary clinical end points were the length of 
hospital stay, the percentage of infants who required supplemental treatment with 
phenobarbital, and safety.
RESULTS
The median duration of treatment was significantly shorter with buprenorphine 
than with morphine (15 days vs. 28 days), as was the median length of hospital 
stay (21 days vs. 33 days) (P<0.001 for both comparisons). Adjunctive phenobarbi-
tal was administered in 5 of 33 infants (15%) in the buprenorphine group and in 
7 of 30 infants (23%) in the morphine group (P 
= 
0.36). Rates of adverse events 
were similar in the two groups.
CONCLUSIONS
Among infants with the neonatal abstinence syndrome, treatment with sublingual 
buprenorphine resulted in a shorter duration of treatment and shorter length of 
hospital stay than treatment with oral morphine, with similar rates of adverse 
events. (Funded by the National Institute on Drug Abuse; BBORN ClinicalTrials.gov

The new engl and jour nal of medicine
T
he neonatal abstinence syndrome 
is defined as the occurrence of signs and 
symptoms of neonatal withdrawal after in 
utero drug exposure.1 Among drug exposures, 
opioids cause severe symptoms, including auto-
nomic instability, tremor, irritability, poor feed-
ing, and loose stool. Measures that improve symp-
tom control include minimization of stimulation, 
rooming in,2 breast-feeding,3 and frequent calo-
rically dense feedings. Approximately two thirds 
of infants with this condition do not have a re-
sponse to behavioral approaches and ultimate-
ly require pharmacologic therapy for control of 
symptoms.4
The administration of an opioid at an appro-
priate dose for symptom control with subsequent 
weaning has been identified as an effective ap-
proach, but data are limited to guide the choice 
of opioid.5 Morphine is used in more than 80% 
of the infants who require treatment for the 
neonatal abstinence syndrome in the United 
States.4 In adults, sublingual buprenorphine is 
used to reduce symptoms of opioid withdrawal.6 
Buprenorphine has a wide therapeutic index for 
respiratory depression and a long half-life that 
may make it useful for treatment of the neonatal 
abstinence syndrome. Open-label investigations 
have established a pharmacokinetic profile in neo-
nates7 and suggested favorable safety and effi-
cacy for this indication.8,9 In the single-site, ran-
domized, double-blind, double-dummy Blinded 
Buprenorphine or Neonatal Morphine Solution 
(BBORN) trial, we compared sublingual buprenor-
phine with oral morphine with respect to the du-
ration of treatment in infants with the neonatal 
abstinence syndrome.
Methods
Trial Design and Population
From October 31, 2011, to May 29, 2016, we 
enrolled term infants (≥37 weeks of gestation) 
who had been exposed to opioids in utero and 
had signs and symptoms of the neonatal absti-
nence syndrome. Exclusion criteria were a major 
congenital malformation, a birth weight of less 
than 2200 g, a serious medical or neurologic ill-
ness, hypoglycemia requiring intravenous glucose, 
a bilirubin level of more than 20 mg per deciliter 
(342 μmol per liter), maternal use of a benzodi-
azepine 30 days before birth, or seizures. Breast-
feeding was an exclusionary criterion until the 
approval of a protocol amendment on October 
17, 2013. This expansion was driven by changing 
local and national4 practice patterns during the 
trial, which increased the number of women 
who attempted to breast-feed. Written informed 
consent was obtained from the parents.
The trial was approved by the institutional 
review board at Thomas Jefferson University. 
The drug manufacturer, Indivior, donated the 
buprenorphine that was used in the trial but was 
not involved in the trial design, in the collection, 
analysis, or interpretation of the data, or in the 
preparation of the manuscript. The protocol, 
which includes the statistical analysis plan, is 
available with the full text of this article at 
NEJM.org.
Treatment
We monitored all infants for the severity of the 
neonatal abstinence syndrome using the MOTHER 
NAS scale, a modified Finnegan scoring instru-
ment,10 which ranges from 0 to 42 (typical range 
in practice, approximately 2 to 14), with higher 
scores indicating greater severity. (Details regard-
ing this scale are provided in Table S1 in the Sup-
plementary Appendix, available at NEJM.org.) 
Scoring on this scale was performed every 4 hours 
for a minimum of 72 hours. The threshold for 
pharmacologic treatment was a sum of three scores 
of 24 or more or a single score of 12 or more.
Infants for whom treatment was required 
were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive 
either sublingual buprenorphine or oral morphine 
and the corresponding placebo. Randomization 
was stratified according to maternal exposure to 
methadone or buprenorphine and the maternal 
intention to breast-feed or bottle-feed.
The dose and regimen of buprenorphine were 
derived from efficacy, pharmacokinetic, and safe-
ty data generated in a phase 1 trial.8,9 Buprenor-
phine was administered at a dose of 0.075 mg per 
milliliter of solution in simple syrup and 30% 
ethanol, which is stable for at least 7 days at room 
temperature.11 Placebo for buprenorphine con-
tained no ethanol (1.75 ml of simple syrup in 
2.25 ml of sterile water). The dose of morphine 
was based on the standard-of-care protocol at 
Thomas Jefferson University Hospital (Table S10 
in the Supplementary Appendix). Morphine at a 
dose of 0.4 mg per milliliter was formulated

Buprenorphine in the Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome
with the use of an oral solution of 4 mg per milli-
liter (Roxane) and dilution with sterile water, 
which is stable for at least 60 days at room tem-
perature.12 Placebo for morphine was sterile water 
mixed with blue dye.
Buprenorphine or placebo was administered 
sublingually every 8 hours by a syringe under the 
tongue. A pacifier was placed in the infant’s 
mouth to maximize contact time with the sub-
lingual mucosa. For doses in which the volume 
was greater than 0.5 ml, buprenorphine or pla-
cebo was given in two administrations separated 
by at least 2 minutes. Morphine or placebo was 
administered orally every 4 hours.
Doses of buprenorphine or morphine were 
adjusted according to disease severity. After the 
first four infants had undergone randomization 
(three in the buprenorphine group and one in 
the morphine group), we amended the protocol 
to change the rate of increase in the morphine 
dose from 10% to 20% to match changes in the 
hospital standard of care (Fig. S1 in the Supple-
mentary Appendix). After infants had symptom 
stability for at least 48 hours, doses were de-
creased by 10% once per day if the sum of three 
scores was less than 18. The investigational-drug 
pharmacist notified the clinical team when the 
cessation dose had been reached. Infants were 
observed in the hospital for at least 48 hours 
after the last dose of a trial medication was ad-
ministered. A rescue dose after cessation of ther-
apy could be given in a blinded manner at the 
discretion of the treating physician in any infant 
with a score of 12 or more.
The maximum dose was 60 μg per kilogram 
of body weight per day for buprenorphine and 
1.2 mg per kilogram per day for morphine (Ta-
ble S2 in the Supplementary Appendix). The maxi-
mum dose in the two groups was reached after 
six increases in dose, which maintained blind-
ing. If disease stability was not obtained at the 
maximum opioid dose, phenobarbital was initi-
ated with a loading dose of 20 mg per kilogram, 
followed by a daily oral dose of 5 mg per kilo-
gram per day. When the opioid was weaned to 
50% of the highest dose, phenobarbital was de-
creased to 2.5 mg per kilogram per day. After 
three additional steps in opioid weaning, pheno-
barbital was discontinued and the opioid was 
weaned until the cessation dose was reached. 
Liver-function testing was performed before or 
soon after the initiation of a trial drug and at 7 and 
21 days after the initiation of therapy.
End Points
The primary end point was the duration of treat-
ment for neonatal withdrawal symptoms in days 
from the first dose of a trial drug. Secondary 
clinical end points were the length of hospital 
stay (including all levels of care), the percentage 
of infants who required supplemental treatment 
with phenobarbital, and safety. Exploratory end 
points included respiratory rate and weight gain. 
Other end points that are not discussed here in-
cluded pharmacokinetic measurements of bupre-
norphine and morphine (secondary outcomes) and 
pharmacogenetic, neurobehavioral, and feeding-
dysfunction measures (exploratory outcomes).
Statistical Analysis
The primary analysis was performed according 
to the intention-to-treat principle. On the basis 
of the results of previous open-label trials, we 
determined that a sample size of 40 infants in 
each trial group would provide a power of 90% 
to detect a 28% shorter duration of treatment in 
the buprenorphine group than in the morphine 
group (a difference of 0.323 on a log scale), as-
suming a common standard deviation of 0.44. 
Owing to slower-than-anticipated patient recruit-
ment, the data and safety monitoring board 
agreed to a suggestion from the investigators 
to stop enrollment before the recruitment of 80 
infants.
The randomization was stratified according 
to the mother’s intended feeding pattern (bottle-
feeding vs. breast-feeding) and maternal use of 
buprenorphine versus methadone. However, only 
3 infants whose mothers were receiving bupre-
norphine underwent randomization (1 in the 
buprenorphine group and 2 in the morphine 
group) and all were bottle-fed, so stratification 
of the analysis according to maternal use of 
buprenorphine was not meaningful. Therefore, 
statistical tests were adjusted only for the type of 
feeding. Neither the duration of treatment nor 
the log-transformed duration of treatment was 
consistent with normal distribution assumptions. 
Therefore, a stratified two-sample van Elteren 
test13 (an extension of the Wilcoxon rank-sum 
test) was used to compare the duration of treat-
ment and the length of hospital stay in the two

groups after adjustment for differences in the 
type of feeding. A Cochran–Mantel–Haenszel test 
was used to evaluate the association between trial 
group and the use of supplemental phenobarbital, 
stratified according to the type of feeding.
No interim analysis was performed. For the 
exploratory end points of respiratory rate and 
weight gain and post hoc safety assessment of 
heart rate before and during treatment, longitudi-
nal data were modeled in a linear mixed-effects 
model with the time trends represented by low-
order polynomials in postnatal days, with the 
polynomial coefficients dependent on fixed effects 
of drug and feeding type and random effects of 
between-patient variation. When appropriate, the 
variance components were estimated separately

Buprenorphine in the Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome
for each group. The degrees of freedom were 
computed with the use of the approach of Ken-
ward and Roger.14 The tests were not adjusted for 
multiplicity because of their exploratory nature. 
All tests were two-sided. Statistical analyses were 
performed with the use of SAS software, version 
9.4 (SAS Institute), and R software (R Foundation 
for Statistical Computing).
Results
Patients
Of the 121 singleton infants who underwent 
screening, 63 were eligible for pharmacologic 
therapy and were enrolled (Table 1 and Fig. 1). 
Mothers were predominantly enrolled in an out-
patient methadone treatment program. On the 
basis of maternal self-declaration of feeding plans, 
21 infants were assigned to the breast-feeding 
subgroup (12 in the buprenorphine group and 
9 in the morphine group). The median duration 
of breast-feeding while receiving a trial drug was 
7 days (range, 0 to 42) during a median duration 
of treatment of 23 days. At the time of hospital 
discharge, 9 of 21 infants (43%) were breast-fed. 
Six infants (29%) were breast-fed for no more 
than 2 days before their mothers decided to 
switch exclusively to bottle feeding.
After randomization, the parents of 5 infants 
withdrew consent for participation in the trial. 
In 4 infants (2 in the buprenorphine group and 
2 in the morphine group), the parental concern 
was based on the slow duration of the weaning 
process. In the buprenorphine group, a parent 
decided to withdraw 1 infant after two doses of 
the trial drug were administered. No withdrawals 
were due to adverse events. After withdrawal from 
the trial, all the infants were treated with open-
label morphine according to the same treatment 
protocol.
In the intention-to-treat analysis, 33 infants 
were included in the buprenorphine group and 
30 infants in the morphine group. In the per-
protocol analysis, 5 infants who had undergone 
randomization were excluded from the analysis 
because of withdrawal of consent. Thus, the per-
protocol analysis included 30 infants in the bu-
prenorphine group and 28 infants in the mor-
phine group. In the as-treated analysis, 3 infants 
who had been assigned to the buprenorphine

group but had withdrawal of consent were in-
cluded in the morphine group. Thus, 30 infants 
were included in the buprenorphine group and 
33 infants in the morphine group in the as-
treated analysis.
Primary and Secondary End Points
In the intention-to-treat analysis, the median du-
ration of treatment was 15 days in the buprenor-
phine group and 28 days in the morphine group, 
a difference of 13 days (95% confidence interval 
[CI], 7 to 21; P<0.001). The median length of 
hospital stay was 21 days in the buprenorphine 
group and 33 days in the morphine group, a dif-
ference of 12 days (95% CI, 7 to 22; P<0.001) 
(Table 2 and Fig. 2). The duration of treatment 
and length of hospital stay were also signifi-
cantly shorter in the buprenorphine group than 
in the morphine group in both the per-protocol 
analysis and the as-treated analysis (P<0.001 for 
both comparisons) (Tables S3 and S4 in the Sup-
plementary Appendix).
The use of supplemental phenobarbital was 
required in 5 of 33 infants (15%) in the bu-
prenorphine group (2 in the bottle-feeding sub-
group and 3 in the breast-feeding subgroup) and 
in 7 of 30 infants (23%) in the morphine group 
(4 in the bottle-feeding subgroup and 3 in the 
breast-feeding subgroup) (P 
= 
0.36). No infants 
were readmitted to the hospital after discharge. 
In a sensitivity analysis, the primary finding was 
materially unchanged when the 3 infants who 
were assigned to the buprenorphine group but 
subsequently received morphine were hypotheti-
cally assumed to have a duration of treatment 
equal to the maximum of all observed values 
instead of actually observed values (P<0.001).
Safety
Overall, 13 adverse events occurred in 7 infants in 
the buprenorphine group and 10 events in 8 in-
fants in the morphine group (P 
= 
0.79 for the 
number of events by Fisher’s exact test) (Ta-
ble 3). There were two serious adverse events. 
One was an inguinal hernia repair in the mor-
phine group and one was a supraglottoplasty 
associated with the Pierre Robin syndrome in 
the buprenorphine group. There were no eleva-

Buprenorphine in the Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome
tions in levels of alanine aminotransferase or 
aspartate aminotransferase in any infant. The 
mean respiratory rate in the morphine group 
was lower by 4.4 breaths per minute (95% CI, 0.7 
to 8.1) than in the buprenorphine group in the 
same feeding subgroup (P 
= 
0.02), although all 
the respiratory rates were within the normal 
range. At 7 days, the mean reduction in weight 
from birth was less in the morphine group than 
in the buprenorphine group (167 g vs. 231 g, 
P 
= 
0.04). There were no significant between-
group differences in the change from birth 
weight or in heart rates at days 14, 21, and 28.
 
Discussion
In this single-center, randomized trial involving 
63 infants with the neonatal abstinence syn-
drome, we found that buprenorphine was sig-
nificantly more effective than morphine in re-
ducing the duration of treatment, with a median 
between-group difference of 13 days in the 
 
intention-to-treat analysis. This difference trans-
lated into a similarly significant reduction in the 
length of hospital stay. Results were similar in 
the per-protocol analysis and the as-treated analy-
sis. We found no significant differences between 
groups in the need for adjunctive phenobarbital 
treatment, although few infants in either group 
received this treatment. These findings suggest 
that the pharmacodynamic effects of buprenor-
phine and morphine may not differ substan-
tially at the predefined maximal doses.
The frequency of adverse events was similar 
in the two groups. Infants in the morphine group 
had a lower respiratory rate than those in the 
buprenorphine group. This potential advantage, 
along with a longer interval between doses, may 
allow for investigation of buprenorphine in out-
patient settings, a use that was not examined in 
this trial.
Limitations of the trial include the small 
sample size and the single-center design. Also, 
since we excluded preterm infants and those 
with in utero exposure to benzodiazepines, our 
results should not be generalized to infants with 
such characteristics. Buprenorphine has been 
used in critically ill preterm infants,15 but its 
utility in preterm infants with the neonatal ab-
stinence syndrome has not been defined. Preterm 
infants have a decreased incidence and severity 
of withdrawal signs,16-18 and it is unclear whether 
the standard scoring instruments that we used 
would be valid in this population. Exposure to 
benzodiazepines in utero is associated with 
worsened symptoms of neonatal abstinence. The 
use of buprenorphine in infants with benzodiaz-
epine exposure is currently being investigated in 
other clinical trials (ClinicalTrials.gov numbers, 
NCT02249026 and NCT01671410).
The mechanisms by which buprenorphine al-
lows for a shorter duration of treatment than 
morphine are unclear. It is possible that the long 
Figure 2. Duration of Treatment and Length of Hospital Stay.
The duration of treatment (Panel A) and length of hospital stay (Panel B) 
were shorter in the buprenorphine group than in the morphine group 
(P<0.001 for both comparisons). Randomization was stratified according 
to the type of intended feeding method (bottle-feeding or breast-feeding). 
The box-and-whisker plots represent medians (horizontal lines) and inter-
quartile ranges (top and bottom of the boxes); the I bars represent the 
maximum or minimum value or 1.5 times the interquartile range. Outliers 
are indicated by circles.

Buprenorphine in the Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome
half-life of the drug smooths out peaks and 
troughs that are seen with morphine and also 
allows for a more gradual loss of agonism at the 
mu opioid receptor than that with a short-acting 
agent. Unlike methadone, another long-acting 
opioid, buprenorphine is a partial agonist. This 
functional antagonist effect may also ease the 
cessation. Agonist effects of buprenorphine at 
the mu, delta, and opioid receptor-like (ORL1) 
receptors and antagonism at the kappa receptor 
may also play a role.
In conclusion, we found that sublingually ad-
ministered buprenorphine was significantly more 
effective than oral morphine in reducing the du-
ration of treatment for the neonatal abstinence 
syndrome, which translated into a shorter hospi-
tal stay. The two drugs had similar safety profiles.
