Abstract
Background—People aged 26–34 represent the greatest proportion of uninsured, and have the 
highest incidence of testicular cancers. The aim of this study was to investigate the association 
between insurance status and cancer outcomes in men diagnosed with germ cell tumors.
Methods—We used the SEER database to identify 10,211 men diagnosed with germ cell gonadal 
neoplasms from 2007–2011. We examined associations between insurance status and 
characteristics at diagnosis and receipt of treatment using log-binomial regression. The association 
between insurance status and mortality was assessed using Cox proportional hazards regression.
Results—Uninsured patients had an increased risk of metastatic disease at diagnosis (RR: 1.26, 
95% CI: 1.15–1.38), compared with insured patients, as did Medicaid patients (RR: 1.62, 95% CI:

 1.51–1.74). Among men with metastatic disease, uninsured and Medicaid patients were more 
likely to be diagnosed with intermediate/poor risk disease (uninsured RR: 1.22, 95% CI: 1.04–
1.44; Medicaid RR: 1.39, 95% CI: 1.23–1.57), and were less likely to receive lymph node 
dissection (uninsured RR: 0.74, 95% CI: 0.57–0.94; Medicaid RR: 0.76, 95% CI: 0.63–0.92), 
compared with insured patients. Men without insurance were more likely to die from their disease 
(HR: 1.88, 95% CI: 1.29–2.75), compared with insured men, as were those with Medicaid (HR: 
1.58, 95% CI: 1.16–2.15).
Conclusions—Patients without insurance and with Medicaid have an increased risk of 
presenting with advanced disease and dying from the disease, compared with those who have 
insurance. Future studies should examine whether implementation of the Patient Protection and 
Affordable Care Act reduces these disparities.

Introduction
The Health Insurance Coverage report states that 42 million people, or 13.4% of the US 
population, were uninsured for the entire 2013 calendar period, while 64.2% were covered 
by private health insurance1. Age is strongly associated with insurance status; the greatest 
proportion of the uninsured are between 26 to 34 years of age (23.5%). This age disparity is 
particularly concerning for testicular cancer, since the median age of diagnosis is 33 years, 
and 73% of cases are diagnosed between the ages of 20 and 44 years2.
The 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) was designed in part to 
expand the proportion of individuals eligible for Medicaid and to improve access to private 
insurance, thereby providing insurance coverage to those who are currently under- or 
uninsured. It is estimated that the PPACA will expand health insurance coverage to 32 
million individuals by 20193 and that over 30% of currently uninsured cancer survivors will 
be eligible for Medicaid or tax credits4. Furthermore, the expansion in coverage is aimed to 
improve insurance for young adults through Medicaid expansion, subsidies, prohibiting 
denial of coverage based on pre-existing conditions, and allowing young adults to remain on 
their parents’ insurance until 26 years of age.
The PPACA has potential to significantly impact both primary and secondary prevention of 
cancer. Previous studies have shown that uninsured patients are more likely to present with 
advanced disease, less likely to receive definitive treatment, and are more likely to die of 
their disease5–8. Furthermore, a recent study showed uninsured testicular cancer patients 
were more likely to present at later stages9. However, to our knowledge, research has not 
examined associations between insurance status - divided into insurance, Medicaid and no 
insurance - and cancer outcomes among men diagnosed with testicular germ cell tumors, a 
disease that is curable even when metastatic. This is important since the PPACA will likely 
involve a major expansion of Medicaid10, a joint federal and state program that helps low-
income individuals pay for medical care, which is run by the states where individuals reside 
and is therefore subject to considerable variations in coverage. Furthermore, prior studies

 have found conflicting results regarding the association between Medicaid coverage and 
cancer outcomes, including extent of disease at diagnosis and receipt of guideline-
concordant treatments5,6,8,11–15.
Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate associations between insurance status and: 
1) stage of disease at presentation, 2) receipt of treatment, and 3) survival among men 
diagnosed with a germ cell tumor using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results 
(SEER) program, which collects population-based data from cancer registries, capturing 
approximately 97% of incident cancer cases from seventeen cancer registries representing 
28% of the United States population16,17. We hypothesized that men without any insurance 
would be more likely to have more advanced disease at presentation and poorer outcomes 
compared with those with insurance, and that the outcomes of men with Medicaid would be 
intermediate between the uninsured and insured groups.
Patients and Methods
Study population
We utilized the SEER*stat software program to identify 11,515 men diagnosed with germ 
cell or trophoblastic gonadal neoplasms between 2007 and 2011, since insurance 
information was collected by SEER beginning in 200718. Testicular germ cell diagnoses 
were obtained from the International Classification of Diseases for Oncology, third edition 
(ICD-O-3), and were classified as either seminoma (n = 5,709) or nonseminoma (n = 4,502). 
Patients ≥65 years old were excluded from this analysis because of lack of reliable Medicare 
data in SEER and because we were interested in testicular germ cell tumors, which are more 
commonly diagnosed in men <65 years (n=206). We also excluded men with incomplete 
TNM staging information (n=564) and those with missing insurance information (n=534). 
Thus, our analytic cohort included 10,211 men in the United States.
Primary predictor
Insurance status was classified according to the SEER categories: 1) insured, including 
private insurance (fee-for-service, managed care, health maintenance organization, or 
preferred-provider organization), insured (no specifics), and coverage from the military or 
Veterans Affairs, 2) Medicaid (Indian/Public Health Service, Medicaid, Medicaid - 
administered through a Managed Care plan, Medicare with Medicaid eligibility), or 3) 
uninsured. We compared men with Medicaid and men without insurance to men with 
insurance, respectively.
Outcomes
Metastatic disease was defined as stage II or III disease at diagnosis based on the TNM 
staging system. Among men with metastatic disease, good, intermediate and poor risk was 
defined according to the International Germ Cell Consensus Classification (IGCCC) system. 
Receipt of radical orchiectomy among all men was obtained based on SEER variables. 
Additional treatment with radiation therapy (RT) for patients with stage I seminomas and 
with lymph node dissection for patients with stage II or higher disease at diagnosis was also 
examined; chemotherapy use could not be examined because SEER does not release this

 information. Finally, we utilized information collected by the SEER Program on cause of 
death (e.g., from treating physicians and links to the National Death Index) to evaluate both 
all-cause and cancer-specific mortality. Survival was defined as the time from diagnosis to 
death, or end of follow-up (December 31, 2011), whichever came first.
Covariates
We obtained information on covariates from the SEER*Stat program. Race was classified as 
non-Hispanic white, African-American, Non-black Hispanic, Asian and other. Geographic 
region (Northeast, Midwest, South, West), tumor histology (seminoma versus non-
seminoma) and year of diagnosis (2007–2011) were also obtained at the individual level. 
Income (median household income) and educational level (percentage of residents >25 years 
of age with at least a high school education) were obtained at the county level from 
SEER*Stat through linkage to the United States Census, and were both modeled as 
categorical variables19. Residence type (rural/urban) was also obtained at the county level by 
linkage to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)20.
Statistical analysis
Data were extracted from the SEER*Stat program. We used log-binomial regression models 
to calculate relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) for the association 
between insurance status and presentation at diagnosis (metastatic disease, IGCCC category, 
and tumor size). All multivariable models were adjusted for sociodemographic and clinical 
factors, including: age, race/ethnicity, income, education level, urban/rural setting, 
geographic region, tumor histology, and year of diagnosis. All factors were measured at the 
individual level, with the exception of income, education and urban/rural setting (county 
level data linked by ZIP codes).
We examined associations between insurance status and receipt of additional treatment 
among men who were initially treated with radical orchiectomy using log-binomial models. 
First, we evaluated associations between insurance status and receipt of radiation therapy 
among men who were diagnosed with a stage I seminomatous tumors. Next we assessed the 
use of lymph node dissection among men who presented with metastatic disease.
Unadjusted associations between insurance status and GCT-specific mortality were plotted 
using Kaplan-Meier curves. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to 
calculate adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the association 
between all-cause and cancer-specific mortality, using time since diagnosis as the underlying 
time scale. Cox models were adjusted for sociodemographic and clinical characteristics 
mentioned above, as well as stage at diagnosis, and tumor size. In sensitivity analyses, we 
conducted competing risks analyses utilizing the Fine and Gray method.21 We also 
conducted propensity-score analyses to balance measurable confounders between those who 
had private insurance, Medicaid or no insurance.22 Next we stratified race to further evaluate 
potential confounding by race. Finally, we evaluated the association between insurance 
status and stage of disease at presentation and survival stratified by state/registry.
All statistical analyses were performed with SAS v9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Two-sided 
p-values <0.05 were considered to be statistically significant.

 Results
There were 10,211 germ cell and trophoblastic gonadal neoplasms identified from 2007–
2011 in the SEER database. Over seventy-five percent of the men (n=7,818, 77%) had 
insurance, 13% had Medicaid insurance (n=1,330) and 10% (n=1,063) were uninsured. 
Table 1 shows the characteristics of the study population according to insurance status at 
diagnosis. Men who were uninsured were more likely to be younger, have a lower household 
income, and live in the South, and were less likely to be non-Hispanic white and live in a 
metropolitan area, compared to men with insurance. There were no differences in year of 
diagnosis by insurance status.
Characteristics at Diagnosis
Thirty-two percent of uninsured men, 44% of men with Medicaid and 24% of men with 
insurance were diagnosed with metastatic disease (stage II or III disease) at presentation. 
After adjusting for potential confounding variables, men without any insurance had a 26% 
increased risk of being diagnosed with metastatic disease, compared to men with insurance, 
and those with Medicaid had over a 60% increased risk (Table 2). Among men with 
metastatic disease, those with Medicaid or without insurance were more likely to have 
intermediate or poor-risk disease, compared to men with insurance (Table 2). Men with 
Medicaid insurance and those without insurance were also more likely to present with a 
larger tumor compared to those who had insurance (Table 2). When the reference group was 
changed to uninsured, those with Medicaid were more likely to present with advanced stage 
(Supplementary Table 1).
Receipt of Treatment
There was no association between radical orchiectomy and insurance status (data not 
shown); >95% of men in all groups received radical orchiectomy (Table 1). However, as 
shown in Table 3, uninsured men who were diagnosed with a stage I seminoma were less 
likely to receive additional radiation after radical orchiectomy, compared to those with 
insurance (RR: 0.82, 95% CI: 0.70–0.95). There was no association between radiation 
therapy and Medicaid insurance. Among men diagnosed with metastatic disease, those 
without insurance or with Medicaid insurance had a reduced likelihood of undergoing a 
lymph node dissection (Table 3).
All-cause and cause-specific survival
As shown in Figure 1, insurance was associated with improved GCT-specific survival in 
unadjusted analyses, compared with Medicaid or no insurance. Median time from diagnosis 
to GCT-specific death was 2.4 years. In multivariable analyses, men with Medicaid 
insurance had an increased risk of GCT-specific mortality (HR: 1.51, 95% CI: 1.08–2.10) 
and of all-cause mortality (HR: 1.69, 95% CI: 1.31–2.19), compared with men with 
insurance. Similarly, men without insurance had an increased risk of both GCT-specific 
mortality (HR: 1.88, 95% CI: 1.29–2.75) and all-cause mortality (HR: 1.58, 95% CI: 1.16–
2.15) (Figure 2). Results were similar for GCT-mortality when conducted using a competing 
risks approach (Medicaid HR: 1.60, 95% CI: 1.17–2.18; Uninsured HR: 1.71, 95% CI: 1.32–
2.21). When we changed the reference group to uninsured, there was not a statistically

 significant difference between uninsured and Medicaid for all-cause or GCT-specific 
mortality (Supplementary Table 1). Similarly, propensity-score adjusted models yielded 
similar results (Supplementary Table 2).
Because Medicaid programs differ by state, we evaluated the association between stage of 
disease at presentation and survival in California (combining Greater California, San Jose, 
San Francisco, and Los Angeles), New Jersey, and Georgia. We did not find a significant 
interaction between state/registry and insurance status on disease presentation or survival, 
and found similar results for metastatic disease at presentation (Supplementary Table 3). In 
New Jersey, we did not find an association between insurance status and GCT-specific or all-
cause mortality (Supplementary Table 4), although this analysis was based on small 
numbers. To further investigate potential confounding by race, we stratified the analyses by 
race. Although based on small numbers, the results were similar. Among white men, 
uninsured men had an increased risk of all-cause and GCT-specific mortality, compared to 
insured (Supplementary Figure 1 and Supplementary Table 5).
Discussion
In this study utilizing the SEER database, we found many potential opportunities for 
improvement in access to care at disease presentation and follow-up, as men without 
traditional insurance were at risk for multiple adverse outcomes. We found that men without 
insurance and those with Medicaid had a higher risk of death compared to men with 
traditional insurance. Uninsured men had a 58% increased risk of all-cause mortality and 
88% increased risk of GCT-specific mortality, compared with men with insurance. Similarly, 
men with Medicaid had a 69% and 51% increased risk of all-cause and GCT-specific 
mortality, respectively, compared with men with insurance.
Our findings suggest that men without insurance are more likely to present with a later stage 
of disease at diagnosis and worse tumor characteristics, including both a larger tumor size 
and intermediate/poor risk classification, compared with men who have traditional 
insurance. We found similar results among men with Medicaid insurance, who were more 
likely to present with advanced disease at diagnosis and receive fewer treatments compared 
with men who had traditional insurance. We found that men with Medicaid or without 
insurance were less likely to undergo a lymph node dissection (RPLND) for metastatic 
disease. An important part of GCT care and a metric of quality is receipt of RPLND for 
residual masses post-chemotherapy. Our findings of lower use of RPLND among uninsured 
men and those with Medicaid could be a surrogate for less access to pathway concordant 
care. We hypothesized that men with Medicaid would have worse outcomes than men with 
insurance, but better than men who were uninsured. For some of our outcomes, such as 
tumor size at diagnosis, receipt of additional treatment, and cause-specific mortality, men 
with Medicaid were in between men with insurance and men without any insurance. 
However, consistent with prior studies5,12, for other outcomes such as stage and risk 
category at disease presentation, Medicaid performed similarly or worse than uninsured.
These findings confirm and extend results from prior studies by examining associations 
between insurance status and cancer outcomes in a well-characterized, population-based

 study of male germ cell tumors. While other studies have demonstrated that broad groups of 
patients with different cancers who are uninsured were more likely to present with 
metastatic disease, less likely to receive definitive treatment, and more likely to die of any 
cause, compared to those with traditional insurance,6,7 our study showed that these results 
are persistent even among patients with Medicaid in highly curable germ cell tumors. 
Notably, we found that both men without insurance and those with Medicaid had a 
persistently increased risk of both germ-cell-specific and all-cause mortality, compared to 
men with traditional insurance. These results suggest that efforts to eliminate cancer 
disparities through the expansion of Medicaid alone may be insufficient.
To our knowledge, this is the first study to rigorously examine associations between germ 
cell tumors and three levels of insurance status in a population-based study. Although a 
recent study reported that lack of insurance was associated with more advanced stage at 
diagnosis and poorer outcomes among men with testicular cancer, compared to those with 
insurance or Medicaid, this study had important limitations9. Notably, this study did not 
separate out Medicaid and non-Medicaid insurance – a potentially important distinction as 
highlighted in this analysis, omitted important confounders (e.g., ethnicity, education, 
income), and included fewer cases.
There are some possible explanations for the mixed findings on the impact of Medicaid 
coverage on cancer outcomes. First, Medicaid-insured men may have lower socioeconomic 
status and poorer access to healthcare than uninsured men. While we lacked individual-level 
data on socioeconomic factors, we found that men with Medicaid were more likely to have a 
higher household income, compared to men without insurance, despite having less 
education. Another possible explanation is misclassification of insurance type. In most states 
when an individual is diagnosed with cancer, they can qualify for Medicaid with the 
eligibility date assigned as the date of diagnosis. Thus, they can move from the uninsured 
group to Medicaid-insured. Consistent with this hypothesis, Bradley et al. found that 
subjects who enrolled in Medicaid after their cancer diagnosis were more likely to present 
with advanced stage disease and have lower survival rates compared to those were enrolled 
in Medicaid before their cancer diagnosis13. Future studies should include timing of 
diagnoses and enrollment in Medicaid to better classify insurance status.
Insurance status in the context of germ cell tumors is particularly interesting as there are 
differences in insurance prevalence by age in the United States. Age is associated with 
whether a person has insurance, and the type of insurance they have, with 19–34 year olds 
accounting for about 38% of the uninsured population under the age of 651. Furthermore, 
testicular cancer is most commonly diagnosed in men between the ages of 20–34, with a 
median age of 33. Thus, expanding insurance availability through the Affordable Care Act 
may have a large impact on cancer outcomes in men diagnosed with germ cell tumors since 
earlier studies have demonstrated that previously uninsured adults increase their use of basic 
clinical services after gaining Medicare or Medicaid coverage and this results in 
improvements in self-reported health23–26. In our study, lack of insurance was associated 
with an increased risk of both cause-specific and all-cause mortality.

 Implementation of the ACA could result in a 70% reduction in uninsured individuals27, and 
is also estimated to increase Medicaid-eligibility among the uninsured, with enrollment in 
Medicaid expected to increase from 55 million to 105 million by 201928. However, as 
highlighted in this and other analyses, Medicaid insurance in its current form was associated 
with poorer cancer outcomes compared to traditional insurance. Therefore, expansion of the 
current form of Medicaid may be insufficient. Medicaid may require significant reform, as 
recently recommended by the American Society of Clinical Oncology, to reduce the 
significant morbidity and mortality associated with cancer diagnoses29. Furthermore, the 
ACA will likely result in an increase in insurance availability to previously uninsured cancer 
survivors; however, 21% of uninsured cancer survivors in non-expansion states will remain 
without coverage4. A recent survey found 27% of childhood cancer survivors reported 
familiarity with the ACA and only 21% believed it would help them get high quality 
coverage30. In addition, another study found survivors of adolescent and young adult cancers 
were more likely to report forgoing care due to high cost, compared to controls31. Thus, 
strategies to improve understanding of the ACA, and improve access and reduce cost 
burdens should be developed to strengthen the impact of expansion of insurance coverage to 
young men diagnosed with testicular cancer on their overall future health. We were unable to 
examine the impact of the ACA insurance expansion on disease presentation and outcomes 
in men with testicular germ cell tumors, but future research should.
There are a few limitations that should be considered. First, SEER does not release 
information on chemotherapy, which is a crucial component of treatment for germ cell 
tumors. While this information is available in other databases (e.g., SEER-Medicare), germ 
cell tumors are significantly more rare in older men. Similarly, although the National Cancer 
Database provides detailed treatment information, including chemotherapy, it does not have 
survival data. When this study began insurance status data in SEER was only available 
between 2007–2011, thus limiting follow-up time for survival analyses. However, nearly all 
GCT deaths occur within 2 years of diagnosis. In addition, SEER does not include 
individual-level information on insurance plans and lumping different plans together into 
‘insured’ may have led to some misclassification of the exposure in addition to the possible 
misclassification of Medicaid mentioned above. Finally, the variables for income and 
education in SEER are based on county-level data, not individual, which may have led to 
misclassification of these socioeconomic variables, although both higher levels of education 
and income are associated with health insurance coverage and health insurance type1.
In conclusion, in this study we found that traditional health insurance—but not Medicaid 
insurance—was associated with earlier stage of disease at diagnosis, increased treatment, 
and better survival among men diagnosed with germ cell tumors in this large, population-
based study. Our results suggest that increasing access to health care is required to decrease 
the deaths of young men with GCT, a disease that is curable even when metastatic. Further 
research into the role of insurance status and adverse outcomes will be necessary with the 
uptake of the ACA and expanded insurance coverage, particularly for those most at risk for 
germ cell tumors.
