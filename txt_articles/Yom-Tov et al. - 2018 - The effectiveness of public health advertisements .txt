The effectiveness of public health advertisements to promote
health: a randomized-controlled trial on 794,000 participants
Elad Yom-Tov1, Jinia Shembekar2, Sarah Barclay2 and Peter Muennig3
As public health advertisements move online, it becomes possible to run inexpensive randomized-controlled trials (RCTs) thereof.
Here we report the results of an online RCT to improve food choices and integrate exercise into daily activities of internet users.
People searching for pre-specified terms were randomized to receive one of several professionally developed campaign
advertisements or the “status quo” (ads that would otherwise have been served). For 1-month pre-intervention and post-
intervention, their searches for health-promoting goods or services were recorded. Our results show that 48% of people who were
exposed to the ads made future searches for weight loss information, compared with 32% of those in the control group—a 50%
increase. The advertisements varied in efficacy. However, the effectiveness of the advertisements may be greatly improved by
targeting individuals based on their lifestyle preferences and/or sociodemographic characteristics, which together explain 49% of
the variation in response to the ads. These results demonstrate that online advertisements hold promise as a mechanism for
changing population health behaviors. They also provide researchers powerful ways to measure and improve the effectiveness of
online public health interventions. Finally, we show that corporations that use these sophisticated tools to promote unhealthy
products can potentially be outbid and outmaneuvered.

INTRODUCTION
Hundreds of millions of dollars are spent on traditional public
health
advertisements
annually.1–7
In
theory,
public
health
advertising can save money and lives by encouraging behaviors
that prevent disease before it happens.8 While the objective of
advertising investments (e.g., encouraging people to quit smok-
ing) differs from those of private advertisers (encouraging people
to purchase a good or service), the central idea is the same: to
change behaviors.
Before online advertising, it was only possible to empirically test
public health campaigns by randomizing small numbers of
participants and to examine a few outcome measures.1,2 This
makes it difficult to test to whom different forms of advertisement
are best targeted.3–6
Humans vary greatly with respect to both their biology and
their beliefs. Medical researchers use predictive analytics to mine
databases of genetic information in order to target treatments to
individuals who are more likely to respond to them. Similarly,
private advertisers use predictive analytics to mine multiple
sources of sociodemographic and behavioral data to better target
individual consumers with the goal of changing their behavior.
However, precision public health interventions have largely sat on
the sidelines both due to the large sums of money required for
targeted advertising and due to ethical concerns.
Ethical concerns arise for a number of reasons. First, participant
data are collected without informed consent.9 Second, many in
public health feel uncomfortable with the idea of manipulating
individual behaviors, preferring instead to work with anonymous
means to attempt to change behavior more generically.10,11 Such
concerns have largely pre-empted the use of precision public
health advertising, leaving only private firms to employ these
tools.
In the private sector, Google, Microsoft, Facebook, and other
internet-based companies provide online services for free in
exchange for the information that drives precision advertising
using “big data analytics”. Online ads targeted using data analytics
can influence emotions and behaviors.10,12,13
First, advertisers can make educated guesses or small-scale tests
about who might respond most to a given advertisement based
on common search terms by topic. Then, advertisement can be
randomized to be shown to users of search engines that search for
such terms. Randomization provides a “gold standard” test of
efficacy. Randomization can also provide causal information on
how different sub-groups (e.g., young women) respond to an
advertisement relative to others. Information on the experimental
responses of different “architypes” of individuals can then re-
tested with newer, more effective advertisements. This incre-
mental approach—targeting, refining, and testing—has the power
to produce online ads that affect beliefs and behaviors.
Big data companies—such as Facebook, Google, and Microsoft
—conduct tens of thousands of randomized-controlled trials
(RCTs) on their users every year.14 These results are invariably kept
inside these companies, but the general process for evaluating
advertisement efficacy is likely similar across companies.
Search
advertisements are
typically
presented as
textual
advertisements that appear on a search results page coupled
with a click through link to the advertiser’s site. More advanced
versions include images in addition to (or instead of) the text.
While it is rare that users click on ads, online advertisements have

 been shown to increase sales both for online display ads and in
brick-and-mortar stores.15 Display and search ads are believed to
produce similar impacts, and about 75% of this increase in traffic
from the cited study was from those who never clicked through.
In this paper, we take the reader through this advertising
process, and conduct, to our knowledge, the first fully randomized
online public health communication’s campaign which tracks not
only click response to ads, but also the searches made prior to and
post advertisement display. Professionals from J. Walter Thomp-
son (JWT), a leading advertising firm in New York City, developed a
series of online ads aimed at improving exercise and eating
behaviors among search engine users (“users”) who are over-
weight. We then experimentally tested these ads using a series of
10 RCTs, each for a different textual advertisement paired with
unique click through content. Finally, we explored the impact of
the ads on changing health behaviors as measured by future
health-promotion searches.
RESULTS
Descriptive analysis
During the month of the RCT, the experiment ads were shown
265,279 times and clicked 1024 times. Of these displays, the ads
were shown 3108 times to 2996 users who could be tracked in
their queries before and after. Additionally, during the month of
the RCT, a total of 505,693 non-exposed users made at least one
query such as the ones which triggered a campaign ad in the
treatment population.
The majority of users were between the ages of 35 and 64, and
females were more likely to see the ads than males (Supplemental
Fig. 1). Of those over the age of 65, males and female users were
about equal in number. A total of 36 tracked users clicked on the
ads.
The tracked users and users who were not tracked were both
successfully randomly assigned (Table 1).
Click through rate
The click rate is congruent with the click rate in other advertising
campaigns.16 As shown in Supplemental Fig. 1, females were more
likely to use terms which triggered the campaign ads, but there
was a trend toward males having a higher click through.
Exposure to textual ads and future target searches
A model predicting future target searches from prior interest in
target searches and from exposure to campaign ads reaches an R2
or 0.314 (p < 10−10). As shown in Table 2, prior interest in target
searches increases the likelihood of future target searches by 52%
(slope = 0.52, standard error [SE] = 0.001; <10−10). However,
exposure to campaign ads significantly increases the likelihood
of future target searches by 15% (slope = 0.15, SE = 0.01; p <
10−10), especially in the absence of prior target searches. Stated
differently, 48% of people who were exposed to the ads made
future target searches, compared to 32% of the controls (a 50%
increase). This difference is even greater when observing the
population which did not have past target searches (30% vs. 15%).
Predictive analytics
We constructed a model to predict future target searches in the
treatment population. Using only respondent characteristics (both
behavioral and demographic) produced a model with an R2 of
0.414. When only previous query topics were added, the R2 was
0.410. When both were added, the R2 was 0.491.
Cox hazards analyses
Table 3 shows the hazards ratios for the likelihood of future target
searches for the sociodemographic and contextual characteristics
of the ads. Recall that we correct p-values for the number of
comparisons
within
each
category.
We
discuss
statistically
significant results here. While the number of previous searches
for keywords is associated with a very slight change in the HR for
future keyword searches, the average person tends to make a
large number of searches. None of the ads were particularly more
effective than other ads in evoking a future keyword search.
However, exposure to more than one ads increases the chance of
a keyword search by 11% (HR = 1.11; 95% CI = 1.03, 1.20). Females
were much less likely than males to perform a future search for
keywords when exposed to an advertisement HR = 0.84 (95% CI
= 0.76, 0.91).
DISCUSSION
We randomized Bing users to receive a professionally designed
public health advertisement or to receive control (status quo)
advertisements. We found that people who view online health
promotion advertisements are much more likely to perform
searches related to health promotion than those who were
assigned “status quo” advertisements. The experimental effect
sizes were large, with 48% of those with exposure to the text
messages (and in some cases, the landing pages) more likely to
perform future health-related searches while only 32% of the
matched control group performed such searches.
At the population level, searching for specific health behaviors
is associated with performing these behaviors in the physical
world.17 For example, the number of people searching for
information about cannabis is highly correlated with the known
number of users of cannabis,18 the number of people searching
for specific medicines corresponds to the number of prescriptions

 sold,19 and the distribution of birth events, as inferred from search
queries, is extremely well aligned with the distribution provided
by the Centers for Disease Control.20 We show that it is possible to
alter the behavior of those with enough interest to conduct a
search online, and show that it is possible to test such behavioral
changes experimentally. With online advertisements, it is no
longer
necessary
to
stab
in
the
dark
with
public
health
advertisement design. Nor is it necessary to guess who will
respond to those advertisements. Rather, it is possible to
systematically target users with advertisements to which they
are most susceptible, thereby eliciting behavior change. Our
identification strategies can, in theory, be used to continuously
refine, randomize, and test the targeting algorithms on different
user types. For instance, it is not only possible to target based on
the users’ age, race, and location, but also on their characteristics
as defined by their internet searches, shopping preferences, and
even email content. The targeting algorithms can use the
information to be “stepped up” until there is evidence that the
user changes his or her behaviors.
Our study was susceptible to few limitations, including those
typically inherent to RCTs. Perhaps the most important limitation
is external validity since we ran the campaign on only one
platform. Second, it is difficult to quantify the impact of the
counterfactual advertisements that were shown to users. The
counterfactual could be health promoting (e.g., gym member-
ships), neutral (e.g., vitamin supplements), or negative (e.g.,
unhealthy foods or products targeted toward high-risk groups).
It is therefore possible that an ad with no efficacy could appear
efficacious if the bulk of counterfactual advertisements discour-
aged future keyword searches.
Experimental offline advertisements have shown that it is
possible to motivate health behavior change with traditional
advertising modalities, such as associating behaviors with those of
desirable social groups.2 The only published RCT of online health
promotion advertisements we are aware of demonstrated that it is
different audiences respond very differently to a given advertise-
ment.16 For example, empowering advertisements were generally
more effective at inducing future searches on smoking cessation
than those that emphasized the negative health impacts of
smoking. But this varied dramatically by the demographic
characteristics of the viewers.
This also raises significant concerns for health departments and
other agencies that could greatly benefit from access to the data
underlying the health advertisements. Most large information
technology firms provide services to users for free in exchange for
access to user data. To best understand how to target users and
change their behavior, it would be useful for them to have access
to identified data that could be linked across multiple sources of
big data. Like academic institutions, most public agencies require
approvals that are difficult to obtain in part because institutional
review boards have not adjusted to the nuances of big data
research and partly because there is no clear opt in for users of
online services. Clearly, cooperation between ethicists, big data
companies,
governmental
bodies,
and
academia
has
great
potential to advance population health. We show that it is not
only technically possible to launch an online campaign that
effectively improves health behaviors, but also that corporations
that promote an unhealthy diet or a sedentary lifestyle can
potentially be outbid or outmaneuvered.
METHODS
Overview
Our RCT was conducted by Microsoft during April 2017 using the Bing Ads
system. In this system, advertisers bid to place the ads when specific
keywords are searched by users of the Bing search engine. Internet users of
the Bing search engine who were logged into a Microsoft account and
searching for pre-specified keywords were selected for this study. Eligible
users were randomly exposed to JWT ads (treatment) or any other ads
served up by the system (control). We then followed both the treatment
and control users’ future search queries, and retrospectively examined past
queries to build and interpret predictive models.
This study was approved by the Microsoft Institutional Review Board and
was declared exempt by the Columbia University Institutional Review
Board under the understanding that the Columbia University researchers
would not have access to the data in any form other than the tabular
results presented in this paper, and further that they would not seek
funding for the study.
This trial was registered on February 2018 with ClinicalTrials.gov,
registration number NCT03439553.
User selection
Those who are motivated to change their behaviors are more likely to do
so. As a result, advertisers often attempt to target individuals with some
motivation to change. In this study, we attempt to improve the viewer’s
diets and increase their levels of physical activity. The goal of the user
selection process was therefore to identify individuals who were motivated
for behavioral change due to social stigma or disease, and then present an
advertisement that suggests a behavioral change that is within reach given
their lifestyle. We therefore selected users who used search terms
associated with social stigma or diseases related to poor diet or low
levels of exercise.
Randomization
The Bing Ads system is designed to randomize advertisements for
experimental purposes. In this study, we selected users for inclusion if they

 (1) were using the Bing search engine; (2) logged into a Microsoft account;
and (3) typed any of the following combination of terms:

bullying)
2. Hypercholesterolemia, Fat, BMI, Body fat, Big gut, Big and tall
clothing, Easy exercises, Healthy diet, Easy workout, Plus size, Weight
loss pill, Diet pill, Weight loss surgery, XXL
The vast majority of Bing search engine users who typed the above
keywords (n = 283,716) were excluded based on a missing Microsoft
account pre-randomization (the account is needed for user demographic
data and analytics). Users who had a Microsoft account were further
analyzed (Fig. 1). Among users with a Microsoft account, those with
incomplete demographic data (age, gender, zip code) were also excluded,
leaving 2996 treated participants and 505,693 control participants. The
CONSORT diagram (Fig. 1) and the age and gender characteristics of the
users (Table 1) show no threats to internal validity. There were no
statistically significant differences in the demographic characteristics of the
treatment and control users (χ2 test, p > 0.05).
In addition to the above four criteria for inclusion of users, campaign ads
also had to competitively bid for an ad on the search results page.
Keyword demand differs by advertisers, and so does the associated
maximum bid for each keyword. To account for the differences in keyword
demand and have a similar baseline for all keywords, we set the Bing Ads
system to automatically adjust the bids for each of the campaign terms
listed above to be high enough for our ads to be as competitive as control
ads (i.e., those of other advertisers), but no more than US$1 per click.
User characterization
We extracted all queries made on Bing by treatment and control users in
our trial, from 1 month before the first advertisement was shown through
until 1 month after the last ad was shown.
For each query, we registered an anonymized user identifier, the time of
the query, the US county from which the user made the query, and the text
of the query. The query was further classified (using a proprietary classifier
developed by Microsoft) into one or more of approximately 60 topical
categories. These categories were encompassed broad topics, such as
commerce, travel, and health.
Users exposed to ads were further characterized by their self-reported
age, gender, and the county-level poverty as inferred from the county from
which they made the query.21
Advertisements
JWT developed both the textual ads initially displayed to treatment users,
as well as the content on the landing page shown when the user clicks on
a textual link. The advertisements were grounded in the Fogg Behavior
Model.22,23 In this model, three elements must come together at the same
time: motivation to change, ability to change, and a trigger for change. The
ads were designed to be “hot triggers,”23 designed to prime highly
motivated users with content that is easy and actionable in order to nudge
a behavior change toward more positive health habits.
All treatment users that enter the keywords above are exposed to the
textual ads. The associated landing pages contained information on how
the subject might improve health behaviors through nutrition or exercise.
However, the vast majority of users will only view the textual advertise-
ments. The JWT text ads fall into three categories: (1) suggestive of healthy
behavior change (“Laugh your calories off”, “Chores: the new workout”,
“Your kids are an exercise”, “'Swalty’ snacks are best”); (2) related to
nutrition or exercise, but not to behavior change (“Burn calories sitting”,
“Lose weight watching TV”, “Pimp up your snack”); or (3) unrelated to both
behavior change and nutrition or exercise (“Find a hairy partner”). Each
textual ad was designed to motivate users to click on the ad. Both the
textual and click through advertisements were explicitly designed to avoid
stigmatizing obesity.
The landing page ads focused solely on nudging users toward changing
their behaviors with suggestions for incorporating small amounts of
exercise or easy dietary changes into day-to-day activities. These were
accompanied by an animated image meant to reinforce the message of
the advertisement (see the Supplemental Appendix). Users were also

Outcomes and predictor variables
Our primary outcome measure was the likelihood of a future search using
a set of pre-specified keywords. These keywords were selected by
identifying common weight-related search terms among Bing users. The
terms fell into categories that suggest that the subject either (1) desires a
deeper understanding of obesity (fat; nutrition; calories; body mass index;
BMI; body weight; body mass) or (2) wishes to change their behavior
(weight loss; weight watcher; weightwatcher; losing weight; and lose
weight).
We were interested in exploring differences in outcome measures for
treated and control users overall, by demographic characteristics, and by
advertisement characteristics (content, placement, etc.). We were also
interested in building predictive analytics that could identify which user
types are most likely to respond to a given advertisement.
We used the following covariates to operationalize demographic and
advertisement characteristics:
1. Past user behavior:
a. Number of past searches by the user
b. Number of past target searches by the user
c. Number of past ads shown to the user
2. User demographic:
a. Age group (categorized into six groups: 13–17, 18–24, 25–34,
35–49, 50–64, or 65+ years)
b. Gender (female or male)
3. Advertisement information:
a. Hour of the day ad shown (integer between 0 and 23 h)
b. Advertisement title (categorized into 10 groups)
c. Was the ad clicked? (yes/no)
d. Search page number on which the ad is displayed (integer
between 1 and 100)
e. Search page position (indicator variable for whether the ad was
placed on the top or the right-hand side of the search page)
Statistical analysis
Given the large sample size, we specified an effect size of greater than or
equal to 10% to be meaningful.
We explored the likelihood of future target searches given user’
exposure to ads, controlling for past searches. We used ordinary least
squares regression to model the association between variables:
y ¼ α0 þ α1x1 þ α2x2 þ ¼ þ þαNxN;
where y is an indicator of future searches, and x the predictors of the
model.
Because previous searches predict the probability of subsequent
searches, we were also interested in the interaction term between the
probability of a subsequent search given exposure to the treatment (the
interaction between the coefficient of conducting a previous search and
being in the treatment group).
We then developed a predictive model. In this model, each user was
profiled
prior to
the
ad campaign with respect to
demographic
characteristics and previous topical searches. With respect to topical
searches, we explored whether the user had performed searches that
relate to one of 60 pre-specified categories of interest. These included
broader topics, such as shopping, travel, and health. By adding a term to
the above equation that includes previous searches in each of these
categories, it becomes possible to examine the influence of inclusion of the
topic on the model’s predictive value, as measured by the model’s
goodness-of-fit (R2).
These models included all 10 of the covariates listed above. These
covariates are used for predictive purposes, and regression is conducted
on a cohort that has already been randomized. This way, it becomes
possible to make predictions based on treatment response when only
treatment status introduces non-random variation.
Next, we used Cox proportionate hazards models and explored 32
predictors of future searches:
HR ¼ exp X1β1 þ ¼ þ XNβN
ð
Þ;
where HR is the hazard ratio, X the predictors of the model, and β their
corresponding model coefficients.
The predictors fell into five broad characteristics of the user and their
exposures: previous searches, exposure to our advertisements, advertise-
ment placement characteristics, age, gender, and poverty. We used
Bonferonni correction for the number of categorical variables within each
of these broader categories. We examined the HR for future searches for
various user and ad characteristics.
In a secondary analysis (see Supplementary Materials), we used
propensity score matching of users meeting inclusion characteristics,
who were matched to unexposed users based on age, gender, and zip
code, and analyzed using the above characteristics. This analysis allows for
a low-noise, low sample size analysis in which it becomes possible to
obtain very conservative assurances that there are statistically significant
differences by treatment status, rather than relying on clinically meaningful
effect sizes (as in the parent analysis).
