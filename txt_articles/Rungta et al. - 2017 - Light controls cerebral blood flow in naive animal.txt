Optogenetics is increasingly used to map brain activation using techniques that rely on
functional hyperaemia, such as opto-fMRI. Here we test whether light stimulation protocols
similar to those commonly used in opto-fMRI or to study neurovascular coupling modulate
blood flow in mice that do not express light sensitive proteins. Combining two-photon laser
scanning microscopy and ultrafast functional ultrasound imaging, we report that in the naive
mouse brain, light per se causes a calcium decrease in arteriolar smooth muscle cells, leading
to pronounced vasodilation, without excitation of neurons and astrocytes. This photodilation
is reversible, reproducible and energy-dependent, appearing at about 0.5 mJ. These results
impose careful consideration on the use of photo-activation in studies involving blood flow
regulation, as well as in studies requiring prolonged and repetitive stimulations to correct
cellular defects in pathological models. They also suggest that light could be used to locally
increase blood flow in a controlled fashion.

 O
ver the past 10 years the use of optogenetics to drive
genetically
distinct
populations
of
brain
cells
has
profoundly
increased
our
understanding
of
neural
circuitry and brain function in health and disease1. Optoge-
netics is now regularly integrated with functional brain mapping
techniques such as blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD)
fMRI in order to generate brain-wide maps of connectivity
generated by activation of specific populations of cells2,3,
a technique termed Opto-fMRI. However, the BOLD-fMRI
signal is not a direct measure of neuronal activity and reports
changes in the concentration of deoxyhemoglobin in vessels. As
such, it depends on a complex interplay between functional
hyperaemia, oxygen consumption and blood volume4. A typical
Opto-fMRI experiment involves expression of excitatory and
inhibitory light-sensitive proteins, for example channelrhodo-
psin2 (ChR2) and halorhodopsin variants, in a defined cell
population and their activation by brief exposure of light (usually
blue for channelrhodopsin2 and yellow for halorhodopsin).
Although the use of photoactivation is warranted for the study
of cell connectivity in vitro and in vivo, the side effects of light
in vivo have not been thoroughly investigated until recently, in
particular when trains of light pulses are used5–7: In 2013,
Christie et al. reported that prolonged (30 s) trains of blue light
delivery to the naive brain of dead rats caused significant fMRI
signals via temperature dependent relaxation changes in T1 and
T2* signals7. The study thus emphasized the importance of doing
control experiments during Opto-fMRI experiments, but also
suggested that by testing the absence of fMRI responses upon
photoactivation in dead brain tissue, one could eliminate all
adverse effects of light8. However, the effects of light on T1 and
T2* signals may add to an additional and direct effect of light on
smooth muscle cells9 and blood flow10 that would obviously be
absent in dead tissue.
Here we combine two-photon laser scanning microscopy
(TPLSM) and ultrafast functional ultrasound (fUS) to investigate
the effect of light (blue to red) on cerebral blood flow (CBF) in
anesthetized naive mice. TPLSM microscopic resolution allows
measurements of blood flow in small brain vessels whereas
ultrafast functional ultrasound (fUS) is a new macroscopic
imaging technique used to measure functional hyperaemia11
and resting state blood flow12 in large brain regions without
contrast agents and with an in plane spatial resolution of 100 by
100 mm and temporal resolution of B2 ms. We report that light
per se, shone through an optic fibre across a chronic cranial
window, causes a pronounced pseudo functional hyperaemia, of
similar magnitude to a sensory stimulation, in the neocortex and
the olfactory bulb. Two-photon Ca2 þ imaging of GCaMP6f in
different transgenic mouse lines reveals that light causes a Ca2 þ
decrease in arteriolar smooth muscle cells that precedes the onset
of dilation in the absence of neuronal or astrocyte excitation,
suggesting a direct action of light on SMCs.
Results
Blue light rapidly increases CBF in the naive mouse brain.
Trains of blue light of similar duration and magnitude to
those used during opto-fMRI experiments (20 ms, 20 Hz, 2 s,
5 mWB45 mW mm � 2 at the brain surface, see the calculation in
Supplementary methods; Supplementary Fig. 1) were delivered to
the brain via an optic fibre, placed directly over the cranial
window (Fig. 1a). Each train reliably generated a fUS power
Doppler signal, indicative of an increase in CBF and detectable at
the level of single pixels (Fig. 1b,c). These hemodynamic
responses were dependent on the power of the light delivered as
they increased in both magnitude and spatial spread in a dose-
dependent manner (Fig. 1d,e). The signals reliably occurred when
the power was reduced to 2 mW, measured at the tip of the fibre
(Fig. 1d,e), which is an overestimation of what reaches the brain
surface (18 mW mm � 2). These results suggest that blue light
itself is capable of increasing CBF, in naive brain tissue.
Light-evoked CBF increase results from artery dilation. We
next investigated the vascular site (arterioles, veins and capil-
laries) at which light could generate fUS signals. We performed
these experiments in the olfactory bulb due to its well defined
circuitry, and the tight relationship between synaptic activation,
functional hyperaemia and BOLD fMRI responses within the
glomerular layer13–17. First we verified, using fUS, that blue light
similarly caused consistent macroscopic increases in CBF. These
increases were within the range of odour-evoked responses
(Fig. 2a,b). We next used TPLSM to determine the location of
these hemodynamic responses microscopically. Unlike fUS,
imaging the vasculature with TPLSM required addition of a
contrast agent injected intravenously (IV). Texas Red (70kDa)
was preferred to FITC, due to the non-overlapping excitation
spectrum with 473nm light and therefore avoidance of the
ROS-mediated blockade of propagated dilation along arteri-
oles18,19.
Surface
arterioles
consistently
dilated
following
stimulation with blue light (Fig. 2c–e), while the diameter of
veins within the same field of view were not affected, suggesting
that blue light evoked a relaxation of vascular smooth muscle cells
(SMCs). The threshold of the arteriole dilation was in the range of
0.5–1 mW (Fig. 2e), corresponding to a mean value between 12.5
and 25 mW mm � 2 (Supplementary methods; Supplementary
Fig. 1). Although blue light is most commonly used in opto-
genetic experiments, yellow-green light is used to activate
Halorhodopsin and Archaerhodopsin inhibitory opsins, and
additional red-shifted ChR variants also now exist20–23. We
therefore
tested
the
dilatory
response
to
a
spectrum
of
wavelengths. Trains of yellow-green, orange and red light
(561 nm, 594nm and 638nm) also dilated arterioles, but slightly
less efficiently, and with the dilation decreasing in magnitude as
the wavelength was increased (Supplementary Fig. 2).
Light does not increase neuron or astrocyte Ca2 þ. Light per se,
delivered with different excitation modes (one and two-photon
excitation) and at various wavelengths has been shown to directly
activate neurons24–27, and thus it is possible that trains of light
triggered the release of vasoactive compounds normally released
during neurovascular coupling. To test the possibility that light
directly activated neurons, we delivered trains of blue light
through an optic fibre across a chronic cranial window of Thy1-
GCaMP6f (GP5.11) mice. These mice strongly express GCaMP6f
in mitral cells28, the principal neurons of the olfactory bulb. The
tufts of mitral cells fill individual glomeruli (located 40–50 mm
below the brain surface) that are specifically and potently
activated
by
odours29,30.
We
first
identified
glomeruli
responsive to specific odours. Figure 3a shows a glomerulus,
comprising the dendritic tufts of mitral cells in which calcium
increased upon a 2 s inhalation of Ethyl tiglate. A broken line
scan, acquired within a capillary and extending into the neuropil
showed that odour stimulation triggered an increase in the post-
synaptic calcium concentration that preceded an increase in
capillary red blood cell (RBC) velocity (Fig. 3b,c), typical of
neurovascular coupling in the glomerular structure. In contrast
(Fig. 3d-f), blue light consistently evoked an increase in RBC
velocity in the same capillary, but in the absence of an observable
elevation in post-synaptic calcium. This light-triggered increase in
blood velocity was reversible and reproducible (Odour: mean
DF ¼ 300±200, mean DRBC velocity (%): 40±20; Light: mean
DF ¼ 0±8, mean DRBC velocity (%): 30±20, mean±s.d., n ¼ 3

 mice). These experiments demonstrate that blue light does not
activate neurons and conversely suggests that it could directly act
on other cells involved in neurovascular coupling or in the
regulation of vascular tone, i.e. astrocytes, pericytes or SMCs. To
test whether astrocyte Ca2 þ elevations were evoking arteriole
dilations, we performed a separate set of experiments in mice
expressing GCaMP6f under control of the connexin 30 promoter.
This mouse line showed high expression of GCaMP6 in astrocyte
end-feet enwrapping arterioles (Fig. 3g). End-feet showed slow
spontaneous calcium
transients.
Light dilated
parenchymal
arterioles without increasing the steady state level of calcium
and the slow calcium transients (Fig. 3h) (light trains: arteriole
dilation (%):

These
experiments
suggest
that
the
photodilation is not mediated by activation of neuronal and/or
astrocyte Ca2 þ-dependent neurovascular coupling pathways.
Light-triggered dilations are caused by a decrease in SMC calcium.
We then investigated whether light activated pericytes and/or
SMCs
in
adult
mice
expressing
GCaMP6f
under
control
of the NG2 promoter31,32. In these mice, pericytes, SMCs and
oligodendrocytes expressing GCaMP6f can be easily distinguished
on the basis of their morphology. Glomerular capillaries are
covered by longitudinal-type pericytes, expressing GCaMP6f in
their
somata
and
processes,
and
in
which
we
recorded
spontaneous calcium transients (Fig. 4a,b). As was observed in
astrocytes, light did not affect the steady state calcium level or the
calcium transients in these pericytes, while it caused an increase
in RBC velocity (Fig. 4b,e) (DF/F (%): 1 þ / � 17, DRBC velocity
(%): 19±9, mean±s.d., n ¼ 6 capillaries, 3 mice). Glomerular
capillaries had a mean diameter of 3.3±0.5 mm (mean±s.d.) and
no attempt was made to investigate whether light caused a minute
passive change in capillary diameter (1–2%), as reported in the
retina upon visual stimulation33. These results suggest that light
acts up-stream and directly relaxes SMCs, thereby increasing
blood flow in the capillary bed. Figure 4c illustrates that
GCaMP6f expression enabled us to identify SMCs enwrapping
arterioles (Fig. 4c). Light reduced intracellular calcium in SMCs,
an effect that preceded the vessel dilation (Fig. 4d,e) (light trains:
arteriole dilation (%): 30±10, DF/F (%): � 30±10; single light
pulse (5 mW, 100 ms): arteriole dilation (%): 14±9, DF/F (%):
20±10, mean±s.d., n ¼ 3 mice). Finally, to eliminate the
possibility that light activated additional calcium-independent
mechanisms in astrocytes or neurons that would indirectly cause
SMC dilation, we tested whether the photodilation occurred in

 other peripheral organs. Supplementary Fig. 3 shows that light,
shone at similar intensities, also increased blood flow in the
kidney. We conclude that light dilates arterioles by directly
relaxing cerebral SMCs independently of the release of vasoactive
compounds from neurons or astrocytes.
Light-triggered dilations are blocked by isoflurane anaesthesia.
Photodilation occurs at an energy deposit threshold of about
0.4 � 0.8 mJ, a value that generates little heat, that is, 0.07 �C
(see Supplementary Fig. 2, and discussion), in contrast with the
larger temperature changes required to induce BOLD signals in
dead animals7. Moreover, it is surprising that it has not been
reported in several opto-fMRI studies (for example, refs 2,3,34)
that correctly controlled for the absence of BOLD signal
generation in control animals (wild-type or ChR2 negative) in
response to supra-threshold trains of light. We thus investigated
whether the key difference in these studies resulted from the use
of
isofluorane
anaesthesia.
Volatile
anaesthetics
such
as
isoflurane, have multiple protein targets, are potent cerebral
vasodilators and there exists a narrow range of isoflurane
concentrations (o1.5–2%) under which neurovascular coupling
is preserved35–37. We therefore tested whether isoflurane altered
photodilation at an anaesthesia level under which responses to
odour were conserved (0.7–1.1% isoflurane, arriving at the nose
cone, see Methods). Experiments on the same vessels were
interleaved between light and odour stimulations and additio-
nally, the same vessels were imaged on different days with
identical placement of the optic fibre to compare the response
under isoflurane and ketamine-xylazine anaesthesia. Surprisingly,
arterioles
which
reproducibly
dilated
to
blue
light
under
ketamine-xylazine anaesthesia did not dilate under isoflurane
(Fig. 5) (Arteriole dilation (%) under Ketamine-xylazine, odour:
24±8, light: 24±8; Arteriole dilation (%) under isoflurane,
odour: 12±5, light: 1±2, mean±s.d., n ¼ 3 mice). Importantly,
odour-evoked arteriole dilations were maintained, although
smaller, under isoflurane anaesthesia.
Discussion
This work shows that light per se, delivered in trains and at
intensities commonly used to trigger functional hyperaemia and/
or fMRI signals in rodents, decreases SMC calcium, either directly
or via endothelial cells, leading to dilation of arterioles. The effect
of light is in the same range of amplitude as that evoked by
sensory stimulation (DRBC velocity (%) with light and odour
stimulation, respectively: 30±20 and 40±20, paired capillaries,
n ¼ 3 mice), and will thus affect the signal size and threshold
detected in opto-fMRI experiments. Although the threshold for
photodilation required more energy than required to activate
ChR2 expressing neurons (single pulse, a few ms), it was lower
than what is often reported for opto-fMRI experiments. Photo-
activation of light-sensitive proteins thus remains a valid tool to
study the role of specific neuronal subtypes in signal processing.
However, careful consideration must be taken for its use in
studies that rely upon blood flow regulation, e.g. neurovascular
coupling or BOLD and cerebral blood volume fMRI. This also
complicates the interpretation of studies using transgenic mice
expressing ChR2 in SMCs, in which light will have two opposite
actions: the photoactivation of ChR2 depolarizing the cells and
raising their intracellular calcium leading to constriction, and the
direct effect of light decreasing calcium leading to dilation.
The result that isoflurane anaesthesia blocked the photodilation
clarifies
why
opto-fMRI
studies
in
which
isoflurane
was
used show no BOLD signal in their light control experi-
ments. However, it also indicates that both investigation and
control
experiments
must
be
performed
under
the
exact
same experimental conditions. It also advocates in favour of

 a2-adreno-receptor agonists such as Medetomidine for sedation
protocols in fMRI studies38,39. It should be stressed that in well-
designed studies where light stimulation protocols are delivered at
energy below the threshold of photodilation (for example,40), the
photoactivation of a specific protein in a given cell type may be
accurately related to a resulting change in CBF.
Our Ca2 þ imaging experiments performed in transgenic mice
expressing GCaMP6 in various cell types of the neurovascular
unit provide some substantial insight about the cell types
involved: the lack of Ca2 þ elevations in astrocyte endfeet and
mitral cell dendritic tufts rules out that light stimulation recruits
‘classical’ calcium-dependent neurovascular coupling mechan-
isms. Whereas the Ca2 þ imaging did not rule out the possibility
that other subtypes of neurons, for example, interneurons, were
activated or that Ca2 þ-independent mechanisms were recruited,
the fact that light also dilated arterioles in the kidney, confirms
that neurons or glial cells are not players in this effect. Our results
are highly suggestive that light leads to Ca2 þ efflux from SMCs
by acting directly on the SMC itself, or indirectly via the
endothelium.
The molecular mechanism and signalling pathway involved
in photodilation remains unclear: it is sensitive to isoflurane,
and is located upstream of actin/myosin interactions in the
signalling pathway, as a decrease in SMC Ca2 þ precedes the
dilation. The obvious mechanism that could trigger dilation is
heat. Stujenske et al.6 recently measured and modelled heat
generated
in
brain
tissue
through
an
optic
fibre.
We
implemented our fibre characteristics and the light protocols
in their model (see Methods) and calculated that our common
protocol (20 ms, 20 Hz, 2 s, 5 mW) should increase the local
temperature
by
0.38 �C,
consistent
with
experimentally
measured temperature changes6,7. However, the energy thre-
shold at which dilation appears (o1 mW, 20 ms pulses, 20 Hz,
2 s; o0.8 mJ) should cause a temperature increase of only
0.07 �C. Such value is within the range of natural fluctuations
observed in the awake brain41, which are not tightly correlated
to blood flow changes.
The excitation spectrum of photodilation shows a decrease in
magnitude with increasing wavelength (Supplementary Fig. 2).
The persistence of a dilation at longer wavelengths used to
activate red-shifted rhodopsins stresses that controls must be
maintained in all cases. Such a wavelength dependency matches
what would be expected from a heat-dependent mechanism.
Therefore, even though our estimated temperature shifts are
extremely small, we cannot rule out the possibility that heat
contributes to the effect and that one of the numerous proteins,

Methods
Animal preparation and surgery. All animal care and experimentation was
performed in accordance with the INSERM Animal Care and Use Committee
guidelines (protocol numbers CEEA34.SC.122.12 and CEEA34.SC.123.12). Adult
mice (2–6 months old, 20–35 g, both males and female, housed in 12-h light-dark
cycle) were used in this study. Mice strains were obtained from the following
suppliers; C57BL/6, Janvier Labs; Thy1-GCaMP6f (GP5.11), Jackson laboratory,
Ai95(RCL-GCaMP6f) were donated from Hongkui Zeng (Allan Institute), NG2-
CreERT2 were donated from Frank Kirchhoff (ULM University). All mice were
bread on a C57BL/6 background. To generate mice with conditional GCaMP6f
expression in mural cells, NG2-CreERT2 were crossed with Ai95(RCL-GCaMP6f)
mice. NG2-CreERT2, Ai95(RCL-GCaMP6f) double transgenic mice were adminis-
tered 2 mg of tamoxifen for 1–3 consecutive days and imaging was done 2–8 weeks
later. The same strategy was used to generate mice with specific expression in
astrocytes except that a Connexin30-CreERT2 (donated from Frank W Pfrieger),
was crossed with a Ai95(RCL-GCaMP6f) mouse.
Chronic craniotomies were performed as previously described51. In brief, mice
were initially anesthetized with an intraperitoneal (IP) bolus of ketamine-xylazine
(100 mg kg � 1 and 10 mg kg � 1 body mass, respectively). Further 10–20% of the
same mixture was injected IP as necessary to maintain surgical plane anaesthesia.
During surgery, the mice breathed a mixture of air and supplementary oxygen and
the body temperature was monitored by a rectal probe and maintained at B36.5 �C
by a feedback-controlled heating pad. A craniotomy was performed with a dental
drill and care taken not to apply pressure to the bone and the area was regularly
flushed with cool aqueous buffer solution to avoid damage or heating of the
underlying tissue. Either a cover glass (100 mm thick) or Polymethylpentene
(PMP) (250 mm thick) was used for the window and sealed in place with
photopolymerizable dental cement, which was also used to form a head-cap in
which a titanium head-bar was also embedded.
The following veterinarian medications were used pre-, during and post-
surgery; the anti-inflammatory, dexamethasone (Dexazone, 5 mg kg � 1 body mass),
administered once daily by subcutaneous injection pre-surgically and one day
post-surgery; the analgesic, buprenorphine (Buprecare, 0.1 mg kg � 1 body mass),
administered by subcutaneous injection after the surgery and the following post-
surgical day if necessary; The antibiotic enrofloxacine (Baytril, 5 mg kg � 1 body
mass), administered by subcutaneous injection pre-surgically and for two days
post-surgery. Mice were permitted to recover for at least 1 week, before the
experimental sessions began.
For experiments mice were anesthetized with ketamine-xylazine (100 mg and
10 mg kg � 1 body mass, respectively) injected IP. Experiments were performed
within 20–120 min following injection of anaesthetics. Depth of anaesthesia was
monitored with breathing rate (2–3 Hz) recorded by a pneumogram transducer
(Biopac Systems) and toe pinch reflex. Body temperature was maintained at
B36.5 �C using a heating pad. In a subset of experiments performed under
isoflurane anaesthesia (Fig. 5), mice were induced with 3% isoflurane for 1.5 min.
For experiments, total flow to the nose cone was (1 L of air/min); (700 ml air/min)
from the isoflurane apparatus set between 1 and 1.5% isoflurane, and an additional
(300 ml air per min) from the olfactometer to deliver odour, thereby diluting the
isoflurane concentration arriving at the nose cone to 0.7–1.1%.
For acute kidney experiments, the same anaesthetics were used as for the
chronic window implantation. A B2 cm incision was made on the skin to expose
the kidney. A plastic palette was gently inserted in between the kidney and the
diaphragm to prevent movement artefacts during the fUS experiments. The optic
fibre was placed directly on the surface of the kidney and ultrasound gel was gently
placed between the ultrasound probe and the kidney.
Imaging the mouse brain with fUS. Following anaesthesia the cranial PMP
window was rinsed with sterile saline and 1 cm3 of ultrasound coupling gel was
placed between the window and the linear ultrasound probe (15 MHz central
frequency, 128 elements; Vermon; Tours, France). The transducer was connected
to an ultrafast ultrasound scanner (AixplorerT.M, SuperSonic Imagine; Aix-

 en-Provence, France). Programming of custom transmit/receive ultrasound
sequences was done in Matlab (MathWorks; Natick, Massachusetts, USA), using
software-based architecture of the scanner.
Ultrasound sequences. The concept of ultrafast Doppler relies on compounded
plane-wave transmissions52. The mouse brain was insonified with a succession of
ultrasound plane waves and the backscattered echoes were recorded and
beamformed to produce an echographic image for each transmission. Although the
frame rate of ultrafast ultrasound can reach more than 10 kHz, a 500 Hz frame
rate was used as it allows correct sampling of the ultrasound signals backscattered
by the red blood cells without aliasing in the mouse brain53. To increase the
SNR of each echographic image taken at 500 Hz, the echographic images
were compounded by transmitting several tilted plane waves and added their
backscattered echoes. The compounded sequence resulted in enhanced
echographic images, thereby increasing the sensitivity of the Doppler
measurement54. In this study, the ultrasound sequence consisted of transmitting
eleven different tilted plane waves ( � 10, � 8, � 6, � 4, � 2, 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10� tilted
angle) with a 5,500 Hz pulse repetition frequency (PRF). The backscattered echoes
were added to produce enhanced echographic images at a 500 Hz frame rate.
Power Doppler data treatment. As the backscattered signals from the mouse
brain are composed of both tissue and blood signals, the following steps were
performed to remove signals from the tissue. First, a singular value decomposition
(SVD) was applied on the stack of the fUS images and the largest Eigenvalues were
eliminated to filter out the slowest variations in the Power Doppler signal which
represented the tissue signal55. Next, the backscattered signals were filtered with a
fourth order Butterworth high-pass filter with a cut-off frequency of 50 Hz to
further remove any tissue or motion artefacts. The Doppler signal of each spatial
pixel was obtained by the incoherent temporal mean of the blood signal. The
increase in Power Doppler signal (proportional to the cerebral blood volume54)
evoked by the light stimulations was measured in each pixel, which were
100 � 100 mm2 in plane size with a slice thickness of 200 mm.
Building activation maps. Activation maps were made using average power
Doppler signals from 3 to 5 trials. Activated pixels were found using a Pearson
correlation coefficient r between the local power Doppler temporal signal
computed from each spatial pixel of the fUS acquisition and a temporal binary step
pattern from 0 to 1 for a duration of 3 and 4 s (for the brain and the kidney
respectively) starting 1.5 s after the start of the light train stimulus. Activations were
considered significant for a correlation r42s, where s is the spatial standard
deviation of the correlation map. Once activated areas were found, the activation
maps were displayed as the percentage increase from baseline of the power Doppler
signal, measured for 1 s and 2 s (for the brain and the kidney respectively) following
the end of the light train. Power Doppler time course variations for individual
pixels are shown in Fig. 1b. Averaged time course plots were calculated by
averaging the temporal signal of the 10 most activated pixels contained within the
activated region (r42s). In a few cases (particularly in the kidney) 5–10 pixels
were significantly activated. Signals were never observed using the same criteria in
the absence of light.
Two-photon laser scanning microscopy. Imaging was performed using a
femtosecond laser (Mai Tai eHP; SpectraPhysics) with a dispersion compensation
module (Deepsee; Spectraphysics) emitted B70-fs pulses at 80MHz. Laser power
was attenuated by an acoustic optical modulator (AA Optoelectronic, MT110-
B50-A1.5-IR-Hk). XY scanning was performed with Galvanometric scanner (GS)
mirrors (VM500; GSI Lumonics). GCaMP6 and Texas Red were excited at 920nm.
Emitted light was collected with a 40X/0.8NA objective (Leica) and was sent to a
pair of lenses, coupled into a 2-mm diameter core polymethyl methacrylate optical
fibre as previously described56. Collected light was split using a dichroic mirror at
580 nm and the signals were each detected with a dedicated GaAsP photomultiplier
tube (Hamamatsu) after passing through an appropriate emission filter (GCaMP6:
525 nm, 50 nm bp; Texas Red: 620 nm, 60 nm bp). Customized Labview software
was used to control imaging paramaters. A mechanical shutter was placed directly
before the 580 nm dichroic mirror to shield the PMTs during the photostimulation
period. The laser light was blocked for a few additional milliseconds before and
after the photostimulation period. Texas Red dextran (70 kDa, Molecular Probes)
was administered intravenously by retro-orbital or tail vein injection. Analysis of
vessel dilations represents maximum absolute value compared with baseline.
Smooth muscle cell calcium decreases were averaged over 1 s surrounding the
maximum absolute value compared with baseline. For mean values in pericyte and
astrocyte experiments, Ca2 þ measurements were averaged during 2 s after light
delivery, relative to the 2 s time period before light.
Light and Sensory stimulation. Optical stimulation, was performed with a
473 nm laser (Coblot MLD, Sweden), a dual laser 488 nm/561 nm (Oxxius, France),
or 594 nm and 638 nm lasers (Oxxius, France) with FC/PC coupler to deliver the
light pulse. The light pulse was triggered through an analogue module to deliver
optical stimulations: Trains (20 ms, 20 Hz, 2 s duration) or single continuous pulses
(100 ms duration). The multimode optical fibre was 62.5 mm (GIF625; ThorLabs,
Germany). The light power delivered from the fibre tip was calibrated using optical
power metres (Gentec-eo, Canada) and was measured during continuous mode.
For spectrum comparison of 473, 594 and 638 nm lasers, the input to the optical
fibre was manually moved between lasers without moving the position of the tip.
Un-connecting and reconnecting the fibre from the laser resulted in power changes
of o5%, measured at the fibre tip. Calculations of power in terms of mW mm � 2
can be found in Supplementary methods; Supplementary Fig. 1.
Odour stimulation was performed with a custom built olfactometer contro-
lled with customized Labview software. Pure air was constantly delivered to the
mouse nose and a valve switched the flow from air to an odour-air mixture
(800 ml min � 1) for a 2 s stimulation. The pressure of the air line and the odour line
were measured and balanced before starting the experiment. Clean air or odour
mixture was supplemented with 200 ml min � 1 O2.
Paired experiments were interleaved, no randomization or blinding was used.
No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample sizes. No mice were
excluded from analysis.
Modelling of heat generation. Simulations to estimate of the maximal local
temperature increase upon our light stimulation protocols were performed
using the model by Stujenske et al.6. Matlab scripts were downloaded from:
http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211124715006488. We first
modelled the light distribution in space with the Monte Carlo algorithm
(MonteCarloLight and LightHeatPlotter Matlab scripts), using Johansson’s model
(default). Calculations were made based on the features of the optic fibre used for
all our experiments (GIF625; ThorLabs, Germany); a fibre radius of 31 mm and
NA ¼ 0.275, and stimulation protocols (40 pulses of 20 ms at 20 Hz, laser power of
5 or 1 mW at the end of the fibre). Temperature changes were modelled for all
wavelengths used (473, 488, 561, 594 and 638 nm) without changing any of the
default values. To obtain temperature increases caused in the brain tissue by our
stimulation pulses we used the HeatDiffusionLight script and plotted the time
evolution of the temperature (time versus depth plot). The maximum increase of
temperature from these plots for each wavelength was plotted in Supplementary
figure 2. Note that the values represent overestimates of the maximum temperature
change because the model is based on an optic fibre inserted vertically in the brain
while we had an oblique optic fibre placed at distance and a piece of coverslip of
100 mm between the fibre tip and the brain. Light attenuation across the coverslip is
negligible.
