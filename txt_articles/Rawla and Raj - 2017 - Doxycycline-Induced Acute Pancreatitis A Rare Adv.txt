Doxycycline-Induced Acute Pancreatitis: A Rare Adverse 
Event
Prashanth Rawlaa, c, Jeffrey Pradeep Rajb
Abstract
Doxycycline is a broad-spectrum antibiotic belonging to the tetracy-
cline group which acts by inhibiting bacterial protein synthesis. It is 
considered to be a relatively safe drug. We report a case of doxy-
cycline-induced acute pancreatitis (DIAP) in an adult female patient 
who was started on the usual therapeutic dose 1 week before for 
acne vulgaris. The WHO causality assessment was possible, and the 
Naranjo scale confirmed it as “definite” adverse drug reaction. A brief 
literature review on case reports previously reporting DIAP has also 
been summarized.

Introduction
Doxycycline is a broad-spectrum antibiotic belonging to the 
antibiotic drug class of tetracyclines which are bacteriostatic to 
a broad spectrum of both aerobic and anerobic gram-positive 
and gram-negative bacteria. It acts by inhibiting the bacterial 
protein synthesis by binding to the 30S subunit of the bacterial 
ribosome and preventing the binding of aminoacyl-tRNA to 
the acceptor site on the mRNA-ribosome complex. Doxycy-
cline is unique in the sense that it does not undergo metabolism 
and is excreted unchanged in the urine and bile. It also does not 
require a dose modification in renal impairment. The common 
side effects of tetracycline groups of drugs are gastrointestinal 
side effects and bone and teeth deposits. Whereas the less com-
mon ones include photosensitivity, renal toxicity and hepatic 
toxicity in patients with impaired kidney functions. These side 
effects are even less frequent in patients who use newer tetra-
cycline like the doxycycline, tigecycline and minocycline [1]. 
Here we present an interesting case of a female adult patient 
who was diagnosed with doxycycline-induced acute pancrea-
titis (DIAP).
Case Report
A 52-year-old adult female who is a known patient of fibro-
myalgia and spondylolisthesis at the lumbar vertebral levels 
L2, 3, 4 for the last 3 years presented with a 3-day history of 
acute onset very severe epigastric pain increasing in severity 
with time since onset. At presentation, the patient reported a 
score of 10 on a pain rating scale of 10. The quality of the pain 
was sharp, and it was radiating to the back with mild relief on 
bending forward. There were no known aggravating factors. 
The pain was associated with nausea and non-bilious vomit-
ing with no traces of blood. The patient denied any similar 
episodes in the past and has no history of alcohol consumption. 
She has a history of cholecystectomy done 2 years back for 
abdominal pain, but the gallbladder was apparently devoid of 
any gallstones.
An ultrasound and a computed tomography of the abdo-
men and blood workup were performed to determine the cause 
of pain. At admission, the serum lipase levels were elevated to 
> 1,600 IU/L (laboratory reference level 10 - 53 IU/L). An ul-

trasound of the abdomen revealed a normal common bile duct 
with its diameter of 5.4 mm (Fig. 1). The abdomen CT findings 
were also consistent with the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis 
wherein there was stranding in the retroperitoneum and the 
abdominal mesentery with trace fluid in the perihepatic and 
pelvic space. There was edema of the head and body of the 
pancreas with peripancreatic edema but without any pancreatic 
pseudocyst. The remaining findings were unremarkable with 
no intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary dilatation, patent mes-
enteric blood vessels and normal spleen and adrenal glands 
(Fig. 2). Further workup was done to look for other less fre-
quent causes of pancreatitis. A magnetic resonance cholangio-
pancreatography (MRCP) was done which did not reveal any 
gallstones or sludge in the common bile duct (Fig. 3). IgG4 
levels were normal thus ruling out autoimmune pancreatitis. 
Triglycerides were within the normal limits, and viral hepatitis 
panel was negative. At this stage, a possibility of drug-induced 
acute pancreatitis was considered. The patient was on oxyco-
done 5 mg twice daily for fibromyalgia and gabapentin 600 mg 
three times daily for neuropathic pain for the last 3 years. She 
also gave a recent history of being prescribed doxycycline 100 
mg twice daily by her dermatologist for worsening acne. The 
patient had been taking doxycycline regularly for the past 7 
days. Since the patient was doing all right with oxycodone and 
gabapentin for a longer time, it was considered that doxycy-
cline would be the most probable cause for the patient’s condi-
tion. However, all three drugs were stopped immediately. By 
then, the serum lipase levels began to fall. It was 1,140 IU/L 
the second day, 347 IU/L the third day and 111 IU/L on day 4.
The patient was started on enteral feeding when her nau-
sea subsided. However, her abdominal pain persisted. Due to 
her constant and severe abdominal pain, a repeat abdomen CT 
was done on day 6 which showed a little necrosis of 6 mm in 
the head of the pancreas. The patient was managed conserva-
tively with IV fluids and parenteral morphine. After the repeat 
abdomen CT was done, the patient was rechallenged with oxy-
codone and gabapentin, and the lipase levels were found to be 
normal. As the patient’s condition improved, oral feeding was 
started and was subsequently discharged.
Discussion
Acute pancreatitis is a life-threatening condition with an in-
cidence of 45 per 100,000 people annually [2]. Drug-induced 
pancreatitis (DIP) is a very rare entity. The estimated incidence 
ranges from 0.1% to 5.3% in human immunodeficiency nega-
tive individuals [3, 4]. A retrospective study from Germany 
in 1993 reported the incidence of DIP to be 1.4% [5]. The 
study from the Czech Republic in 2010 reported that among 
170 cases of acute pancreatitis, 5.3% were DIP [4]. Thus, the 
exact incidence of DIP is very hard to determine, and of this, 
doxycycline to be reported as a causative drug has been ex-
ceedingly rare [6]. A PubMed search which was performed 
using the MeSH terms “Doxycycline” AND “Pancreatitis” 
shortlisted just two case reports reporting definite DIAP [6, 7]. 
There were two other case reports reporting probable DIAP [8, 
9]. The case reported by Ocal et al [8] had concomitant use of 
ornidazole and a much higher dose of doxycycline (500 mg 
twice daily). While the other case reported by Moy and Ka-
pila [9] had other causes of pancreatitis namely highly uncon-
trolled diabetes mellitus (HbA1c: 15.5%) and diabetic ketoaci-
dosis which are more common than DIP. Thus, it is evident that 
DIAP is a rare condition.
The diagnosis of DIAP was a diagnosis of exclusion after 
all other common causes such as biliary disease and alcohol-
ism were ruled out. In our patient, there were few more con-
comitant drugs used for other co-morbidities. Since the patient 
was on these medications for more than 3 years, it was unlikely 
that they caused pancreatitis. However, these drugs were also 
stopped and later rechallenged after 6 days of stopping which

proved harmless as confirmed by the normal serum lipase lev-
els. Hence we believe that our case is one of the well-proven 
cases of DIAP with a well corroborating temporal association 
of the use of a drug. The mechanism by which it causes pan-
creatitis is largely unknown. However, because of the rarity, it 
may be considered as an idiosyncratic reaction [6].
According to the WHO causality assessment, doxycycline 
is the “probable” cause for DIP as de-challenge was positive 
and re-challenge was not done. According to the Naranjo algo-
rithm, the adverse drug reaction (ADR) was classified as “defi-
nite” ADR with a score of 9 (2 points each for an adverse event 
occurring after doxycycline was administered and other causes 
being ruled out. One point each for the availability of previous 
conclusive reports of DIAP, an improvement on stopping the 
drug, less severe when the dose was decreased, and pancreati-
tis confirmed objectively with imaging and blood tests) [10]. 
According to the Schumock and Thornton preventability scale, 
the ADR was unpreventable [11] and based on the Hartwig and 
Siegel severity assessment scale, the severity of the reaction is 
placed at level 5 which involves withholding of the suspected 
drug and a prolonged hospital stay by at least 1 day with ad-
mission in the intensive care unit [10].
Conclusion
Doxycycline is a well-studied drug with a good safety profile, 
and food and drug administration (FDA) approved it for mul-
tidisciplinary clinical uses like the treatment of a wide variety 
of bacterial infections including acne vulgaris and periodontitis. 
Here, we report a rare case of DIAP. It is important that the phy-
sician keeps such rare adverse events in mind and have a high 
degree of suspicion to tackle the crisis effectively. To conclude, 
drug should be entertained as a possible etiology of idiopathic 
pancreatitis when other common causes are ruled out keeping in 
mind the vastly expanding pharmacotherapy in the recent times.
