BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Bullying is a significant public health concern, and it has received 
considerable attention from the media and policymakers over the past decade, which has 
led some to believe that it is increasing. However, there are limited surveillance data on 
bullying to inform our understanding of such trends over the course of multiple years. The 
current study examined the prevalence of bullying and related behaviors between 2005 
and 2014 and explored whether any such changes varied across schools or as a function of 
school-level covariates.
METHODS: Youth self-reports of 13 indicators of bullying and related behaviors were collected 
from 246 306 students in 109 Maryland schools across 10 years. The data were weighted to 
reflect the school populations and were analyzed by using longitudinal hierarchical linear 
modeling to examine changes over time.
RESULTS: The covariate-adjusted models indicated a significant improvement over bullying 
and related concerns in 10 out of 13 indicators (including a decrease in bullying and 
victimization) for in-person forms (ie, physical, verbal, relational) and cyberbullying. 
Results also showed an increase in the perceptions that adults do enough to stop bullying 
and students’ feelings of safety and belonging at school.
CONCLUSIONS: Prevalence of bullying and related behaviors generally decreased over this 
10-year period with the most recent years showing the greatest improvements in school 
climate and reductions in bullying. Additional research is needed to identify factors that 
contributed to this declining trend.

Bullying has received considerable 
media attention over the past decade 
and has led some people to believe 
that bullying is on the rise.1 Research 
has also documented the negative 
impacts of bullying on mental health 
and behavioral, academic, and health 
outcomes, 
2, 
 
3 and all states have now 
adopted laws that address bullying.4 
Yet, there are limited surveillance 
data on bullying to examine trends 
over multiple years. The current 
study examined the prevalence of 
bullying and related behaviors and 
attitudes over 10 years (2005–2014) 
using a population-based sample of 
students in grades 4 to 12. The extent 
to which any such changes varied as 
a function of school-level covariates 
was also examined.
Bullying is the form of victimization 
most frequently experienced by 
school-aged children.5 
– 
8 Since a 
landmark, large-scale surveillance 
study documented that 30% of 
youth are involved in bullying, 
6 there 
has been a significant increase in 
the research on various aspects of 
bullying, including prevalence, risk 
factors, and correlates.1, 
 
9 
–12 Multiple 
studies have documented both short- 
and long-term problematic effects 
and correlates of bullying, thereby 
demonstrating its significance as a 
public health concern.1, 
 
6, 
 
9, 
 
11, 
12  
However, few studies have examined 
prevalence over multiple years; 
moreover, virtually none of the 
large, population-based studies 
have included longitudinal data 
or an in-depth examination of the 
prevalence across several indicators 
and characteristics of bullying.1 
Despite these and other limitations 
regarding the availability of 
surveillance data on bullying, 
1, 
 
13  
there have been some efforts to 
formulate conclusions regarding 
trends over time.1 For example, 
Finkelhor summarized bullying 
trends from 5 US national surveys 
by suggesting that bullying has 
decreased since the 1990s with less 
decline since 2007.14 The annual 
report of the Indicators of School 
Crime and Safety 
8 indicated that in 
2013, 22% of youth ages 12 to 18 had 
been bullied, which was down from 
28% in 2012.
Nevertheless, there are a number of 
limitations associated with the extant 
population-based data sources.  
For example, several studies have 
used measures of “bullying, 
” which 
was not well defined on the survey  
or did not meet the Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention’s13 
definition of bullying (ie, intentional 
aggressive behavior that occurs in 
the context of a power differential 
and is repeated or has the potential 
to be repeated). Moreover, previous 
studies have focused almost 
exclusively on victimization with 
limited exploration of perpetration, 
14  
multiple forms of bullying (eg, 
physical, verbal, indirect, electronic), 
witnessing, or other bullying-related 
behaviors or attitudes (eg, beliefs 
about aggressive retaliation).8 
Another limitation is the historical 
focus on a narrow age range, typically 
middle and/or early high school, 
with a lack of trend data spanning 
elementary through high school.8 
This has precluded the field from 
formulating strong conclusions 
regarding potential developmental 
differences in bullying trends.7, 
 
8, 
 
14 
– 
16  
Most exploration of trends in  
rates of bullying has been based  
upon t tests comparing the current 
rates to a single, earlier time point.8 
Finally, few population-based 
studies have adjusted for school-
level covariates despite research 
suggesting that school factors  
are potential risk factors for 
bullying.6, 
 
17, 
 
18 In summary, although 
much of the extant population-based 
survey research examining trends 
in bullying over time suggests a 
decline, there are several limitations 
caused by the previous studies’ large 
focus on secondary-school students 
and reliance on a relatively narrow 
band of indicators across just a few 
sequential years of data.8
The overarching goal of this study 
was to address the above-mentioned 
gaps in bullying research by 
examining trends in 13 indicators of 
bullying and related attitudes and 
behaviors in a population-based 
sample of youth in grades 4 to 12 
across a decade. The timing of this 
study (2005–2014) is also important 
given the unprecedented increase in 
attention to this public health issue in 
recent years.1 Consistent with extant 
studies, 
1, 
 
8, 
 
14, 
16 slight reductions 
in the rates of bullying over time 
were expected (with the possible 
exception of cyberbullying, which 
smaller-scale studies suggest may be 
increasing19 due in part to greater 
availability of smartphones).20 
We also explored whether the 
variation in bullying prevalence was 
functionally associated with school-
level covariates21 such as school 
size, urbanicity, and school level 
(eg, secondary versus elementary 
schools).5, 
6,

sample
Participants were enrolled in grades 
4 to 12 within a large public school 
district in Maryland; 109 schools 
were included in this analysis, of 
which 78 were elementary, 19 were 
middle, and 12 were high schools 
(see Tables 1 and 2). Alternative 
and special education settings were 
excluded because of small sample 
sizes and differences in the school 
structures and student populations.
Across the 10 years, there were a 
total of 246 306 respondents; see 
 
Tables 1 and 2 for year-specific 
data and Table 3 for student 
demographic characteristics. Student 
self-report surveys were completed 
anonymously and therefore could 
not be linked over time (see 
weighting procedure below). The 
student participation rate was ∼74% 
across all schools. For additional 
information on the data collection, 
see ref 5.

bullying Measure
An online survey system was 
developed by researchers at the 
Johns Hopkins Center for the 
Prevention of Youth Violence in 
collaboration with school-based 
partners (see refs 5, 
 
22, 
 
23). The 
content for the survey was based 
on the Olweus Bully/Victim 
Questionnaire24 and the World 
Health Organization’s bullying 
survey.6
Participants in grades 4 and 5 
completed an abbreviated version 
of the full survey to reduce the time 
and reading comprehension burdens 
on the younger children. Otherwise, 
the items completed by fourth- and 
fifth-graders and sixth- to twelfth-
graders were identical. The survey 
included a definition of bullying that 
was consistent with the World Health 
Organization6 and the Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention13: “A 
person is bullied when he or she is 
exposed, repeatedly and over time, 
to negative actions on the part of one 
or more other persons. Bullying often 
occurs in situations where there is a 
power or status difference. Bullying 
includes actions like threatening, 
teasing, name-calling, ignoring, 
rumor spreading, sending hurtful 
emails and text messages, and leaving 
someone out on purpose.”25, 
 
26 For 
additional information regarding 
the validity and reliability of self-
reported measures of bullying using 
this approach, see refs 13, 
 
24.
Prevalence and Forms of Bullying
The primary indicators of interest 
included whether a student had been 
a frequent victim of bullying and 
had frequently perpetrated bullying 
(ie, 2 or more experiences) in the 
past month.24, 
 
25 A multiresponse 
item asked respondents to indicate 
whether they had experienced as 
a victim (yes/no) specific forms of 
bullying within the past month5, 
 
22, 
26  
including 2 forms of physical bullying 
(pushing and slapping), 1 form of 
verbal bullying (threats), 1 form 
of relational bullying (spreading 
rumors), and cyberbullying (e-mail 
and blogs6, 
 
24). Participants were 
also asked, “During the past 30 days 
(month), how often have you seen 
someone else being bullied” (recoded 
to seen 1 or more times [1] and not 
seen [0]; witnessed bullying).
Bullying-Related Attitudes
Attitudes toward aggressive 
retaliation (“It is okay to hit others 
if they hit me first”27), the overall 
perception of bullying as a problem 
(“Bullying is a problem at this 
school”), and the perceived role 
of adults in preventing bullying 
(“Adults are doing enough to 
prevent or stop bullying”) were also 
assessed. Participants responded on 
a 4-point Likert scale from strongly 
disagree to strongly agree. For the 
current analysis, these items were 
dichotomized into strongly disagree/
disagree (0) and agree/strongly 
agree (1).
Perceptions of School Climate
A final set of items assessed students’ 
perceptions of belonging28 (“I feel 
like I belong at this school”) and 
safety (“I feel safe at this school”). 
Participants used the same 4-point 
Likert scale as above, which was also 
dichotomized, with (1) indicating 
a more favorable perception of the 
school.
school-Level covariates
School-level covariates from 2004 
to 2005 (ie, the year preceding data 
collection) were publicly available 
data collected from the Maryland 
State Department of Education and 
included the school enrollment 
(ie, number of students), student-
teacher ratio, attendance rate (ie, 
percent of students present in the 
school for at least half of the average 
school day during the school year), 
mobility rate (ie, number of entrants 
and withdrawals divided by the 
total enrollment), and the percent 
of students receiving free and

school level (ie, elementary, high) 
was also included.
Procedure
Each year, the school district 
administered the online survey 
over the course of a 3- to 4-week 
window by using a passive parental-
consent process. School staff (ie, 
teachers, guidance counselors, or 
school psychologists) administered 
the survey to students after a 
written procedure. Language 
arts classrooms were selected at 
random after a written procedure 
developed by the researchers to 
survey students in grades 4 to 12; the 
school staff members identified to 
administer the survey read aloud the 
instructions and bullying definition 
and emphasized the anonymous 
nature of the survey. Data were 
anonymously self-reported through 
a password-protected Web site on 
school computers that was only 
accessible during school hours. 
Limited participant demographic 
information was collected to ensure 
anonymity. The district provided 
the nonidentifiable data to the 
researchers for analysis. This study 
was approved by the researchers’ 
institutional review board (for 
additional detail on methods, see refs 
 
5, 
 
17, 
 
22, 
 
23).
analyses
Weighting Procedures
The data from years and schools 
were weighted29 to reflect the school 
populations by using grade, sex, 
and race/ethnicity data provided by 
students. Specifically, at each time 
point, survey weights were calculated 
for each student within his or her 
school using a raking ratio estimation 
procedure.30 The purpose of the 
weights was to reduce noncoverage 
biases.30 The weighted data were 
then aggregated to the school level at 
each time point to examine school-
level changes in prevalence of the 13 
bullying-related indicators over time. 
Percentages were calculated using 
the weighted count of students who 
endorsed each item divided by the 
total student weights in the school.
Hierarchical Linear Modeling
Repeated measures, 2-level growth 
models in hierarchical linear 
modeling (HLM) version 731 were fit 
for each of the 13 bullying indicators. 
Level 1 represented the 10 years of 
repeated observations for each of the 
school-level percentages, and Level 2 
represented the school.
Fully unconditional (ie, unadjusted) 
models, with only a variable 
representing time as the predicting 
covariate, were fit for each outcome, 
allowing for an examination of the 
initial between-school variability as 
well as the unadjusted intercept (ie, 
prevalence) and slope (ie, growth) 
estimates. Covariate-adjusted models 
included school type (elementary, 
high), enrollment, attendance, 
student mobility, student-teacher 
ratio, and percentage of students 
receiving FARMs to predict the 
intercept and slope of time at Level 2. 
Grand-mean centering was employed 
for all continuous covariates 
whereas the dichotomous school-
type variables were uncentered.32 
Intraclass correlation coefficients 
(ICCs) and Cohen’s d effect size 
estimates were calculated as 
indicators of the change across time.
ResuLTs
Weighted Descriptive Findings
See Table 4 for the weighted 
average responses and effect size 
of the changes across time for each 
of the 13 indicators. The rates of 
self-reported, frequent-bullying 
victimization ranged from 13.4% 
to 28.8% across the decade. With 
regard to bullying perpetration, the 
rates ranged from 7.0% to 21.3%.

statistically significant changes over 
time. Specifically, being victimized 
(overall, β = −.02, P < .001), as well 
as being victimized by being pushed 
(β = −.03, P < .001), hit (β = −.03, P < 
.001), threatened (β = −.02, P < .001), 
cyberbullied (β = −.01, P < .001), and 
having rumors spread (β = −.02,  
P < .001) all decreased significantly 
over the 10 years. In addition, the 
prevalence of perpetrating bullying 
decreased significantly (β = −.02, 
P < .001); the same was true for 
witnessing bullying (β = −.04, 
P < .001). In terms of attitudes, 
significantly fewer students reported 
aggressive retaliatory attitudes over 
the 10 years (β = −.01, P < .001). 
Although perceptions that adults 
do enough to stop bullying showed 
significant improvement in the 
unadjusted models, it was no longer 
significant in the covariate-adjusted 
model. Finally, a statistically greater 
proportion of students reported 
feeling safe at school over time  
(β = .02, P < .001).
Associations With Covariates
The most consistently significant 
school-level covariate associated 
with the outcomes was school 
level. With regard to the intercept, 
elementary schools reported fewer 
bullying concerns compared with 
middle and high schools. With regard 
to the slope, elementary schools 
showed significantly less decline 
in reports of witnessing bullying 
over time compared with middle 
schools (β = .015, P < .01). Reports 
of feeling safe in elementary schools 
had significantly less improvement 
over time compared with middle 
schools (β = −.014, P < .01) whereas 
high schoolers reported significantly 
greater improvement in feelings 
of safety compared with middle 
schoolers (β = .02, P < .01). High 
schoolers demonstrated greater 
declines in witnessing bullying across 
time compared with middle schoolers 
(β = −.02, P < .05). See Table 5 
for additional associations with 
covariates and the ICCs illustrating 
the extent of correlation among each 
variable over time.
DIscussIOn
This study examined the prevalence 
rates of 13 bullying-related 
indicators in a population-based 
sample over 10 years. Survey data 
from nearly one-quarter of a million 
students indicated that bullying 
has remained a prevalent, although 
declining, experience for school-aged 
youth. Specifically, 13.4% to 28.8% 
of students reported experiencing 
bullying in the past month, and 
approximately half of the students 
reported witnessing bullying. These 
estimates are consistent with recent 
bullying-prevalence reports, 
8 and 
they add to the current literature 
with the inclusion of a younger 
sample of youth. Despite these fairly 
high prevalence rates, the covariate-
adjusted results for 10 of the 13 
indicators suggested things may 
be getting better, as indicated by a 
reduction in bullying prevalence and 
related attitudes. The effect sizes 
of the change were in the small-to-
moderate range (ranged 0.04–0.67) 
when comparing the first and last 
years’ data.
Some forms of victimization 
were commonly and consistently 
experienced across years (eg, 
relational). The prevalence of 
cyberbullying was consistently 
<10% and is comparable to the 
National Center for Education 
Statistics and the Bureau of Justice 
Statistics8 data. Based on previous 
research, 
19 it was hypothesized 
that cyberbullying might increase, 
but consistent with the other forms 
of bullying, cyberbullying also 
decreased. However, given the rapid 
change of technology and new social 
media platforms used by youth and 
increasingly at younger ages, the 
nature and quality of cyberbullying 
may change; therefore, future studies 
should examine cyberbullying 
in greater detail (eg, broader 
definitions).33 Physical, verbal, and 
relational bullying experiences 
dropped ∼2% each year to below 
10% in the most recent year. Rates 
of perpetration reduced by 1% to

2% per year and dropped below 
10% in recent years. Furthermore, 
witnessing bullying also decreased 
significantly across the decade.
Approximately 80% of students 
reported feeling safe and like 
they belong at school across the 
decade. Interestingly, ratings of 
safety, but not belonging, improved 
significantly over time. There were 
clear differences regarding bullying 
and climate across school levels. 
For example, high schools showed 
the most improvement across time; 
although this is promising, bullying 
peaks during middle school, 
5  
so additional supports may be 
necessary during these school 
years. Although the yearly changes 
for all of the outcomes were small, 
some of these changes were fairly 
substantial across 10 years, as 
indicated by the effect size estimates 
comparing the first and last years 
(average d = 0.325). Notably, the 
most recent years evinced the 
greatest improvements in school 
climate and reductions in bullying. 
This could be due to the increase 
in bullying policies4 over the past 
decade as well as the simultaneous 
increase in effective evidence-based 
programming aimed at reducing 
school-based bullying.2, 
 
34 These 
factors could be associated with 
further decreases in bullying in years 
to come, 
34 so it will be important to 
continue to surveil these indicators 
over time.
The significant associations between 
school-level covariates and the 
change in bullying indicators were 
limited and not consistent across 
outcomes. Given the small magnitude 
of the covariate estimates and the 
large number of outcomes examined, 
readers should be cautious in the 
interpretation of the trends regarding 
school-level covariates.
Although this study possesses 
strengths such as the population-
level sampling, the large sample size,

the broad age range surveyed, and 
the longitudinal nature of the data, 
some limitations should be noted. 
For example, student data across 
years were not linked, given the 
anonymous nature of the survey, 
which limited the analyses that 
could be conducted. The anonymity 
was, however, an essential part of 
maximizing response rates and may 
have contributed to students being 
more candid in their responses; 
given the sensitive nature of the data 
collected, anonymity decreases the 
chances of response bias related 
to social desirability, which could 
otherwise be a threat to validity. 
Although the data collection 
and sampling procedures were 
consistent across the 10 waves of 
data collection, the district leadership 
has placed greater emphasis on the 
collection of data in recent years; 
this may have contributed to a slight 
uptick in the number of students 
participating in the survey in the last 
year of the data collection. However, 
the weighting procedure allows for 
generalizability of the sample to the 
full population of students within 
these schools. The use of sampling 
weights was a strength of this study, 
although we were somewhat limited 
in the number of variables we had 
to use as weights; therefore, we 
relied largely on basic demographic 
information that was available at 
both the student and school levels. 
This is a common approach in large-
scale survey research.30
Although this study addresses 
the prevalence of bullying-related 
indicators over a decade, it does 
not shed light on what accounts 
for these changes. Information 
related to particular school efforts, 
programs, or initiatives to which 
reductions in bullying or related 
attitudes could be attributed was 
not assessed and, therefore, could 
not be examined. Future research is 
needed to systematically examine 
the implementation of antibullying 
programs and policies and the impact 
of these efforts.

The current findings suggest that 
there have been some improvements 
in the rates of bullying between 
2005 and 2014. Although promising, 
it is important to emphasize that 
a large proportion of youth are 
still experiencing bullying, and the 
current prevalence rates continue to 
be of great concern.1 Nevertheless, 
these findings do contradict the 
public’s (mis)perception that bullying 
is increasing.1, 
 
35 With greater 
attention given to bullying in recent 
years, it is encouraging to see that 
there may be some improvements.
