Purpose:
To investigate the utility and accuracy of breast magnetic 
resonance (MR) imaging as a supplemental screening tool in 
women at average risk for breast cancer and to investigate 
the types of cancer detected with MR imaging screening.
Materials and 
Methods:
This prospective observational study was conducted at two 
academic breast centers in women aged 40–70 years without 
breast cancer–associated risk factors (lifetime risk ,15%). 
Between January 2005 and December 2013, women with 
at least minimal residual breast tissue (American College of 
Radiology categories A–D) and normal conventional imaging 
findings (screening mammography with or without screen-
ing ultrasonography [US]) were invited to undergo supple-
mental MR imaging screening. Outcome measures were 
supplemental cancer detection rates, interval cancer rates, 
and biologic profiles of MR imaging–detected additional can-
cers, as well as specificity and positive predictive value (PPV) 
of MR imaging screening. Tissue diagnoses or 2 years of 
follow-up were used to establish the reference standard.
Results:
A total of 2120 women were recruited and underwent 3861 
screening MR imaging studies, covering an observation 
period of 7007 women-years. Breast MR imaging depicted 
60 additional breast cancers (ductal carcinoma in situ, n 
= 20; invasive carcinoma, n = 40) for an overall supple-
mental cancer detection rate of 15.5 per 1000 cases (95% 
confidence interval [CI]: 11.9, 20.0). Forty-eight additional 
cancers were detected with MR imaging at initial screening 
(supplemental cancer detection rate, 22.6 per 1000 cases). 
During the 1741 subsequent screening rounds, 12 of 13 
incident cancers were found with MR imaging alone (sup-
plemental cancer detection rate, 6.9 per 1000 cases). One 
cancer was diagnosed with all three methods (mammogra-
phy, US, and MR imaging), and none were diagnosed with 
mammography only or US only. Cancers diagnosed with 
MR imaging were small (median, 8 mm), node negative in 
93.4% of cases, and dedifferentiated (high-grade cancer) in 
41.7% of cases at prevalence screening and 46.0% of cases 
at incidence screening. No interval cancers were observed. 
MR imaging screening offered high specificity (97.1%; 95% 
CI: 96.5, 97.6) and high PPV (35.7%; 95% CI: 28.9, 43.1).
Conclusion:
In women at average risk for breast cancer, MR imaging 
screening improves early diagnosis of prognostically rele-
vant breast cancer.

women at high risk for breast cancer. In 
this setting, MR imaging screening ex-
hibits a consistently superior sensitivity 
when compared with that of mammo-
graphic and US screening (13–18). Ini-
tial evidence is now emerging that MR 
screening in women with familial breast 
cancer translates into a survival benefit 
(19–21). However, the utility and clini-
cal performance of MR imaging screen-
ing in women who belong to the target 
population of mammographic screening 
programs (ie, women at average risk 
and aged 40–70 years) is unknown.
Thus, the primary aim of this study 
was to investigate the diagnostic accu-
racy and supplemental cancer yield of 
MR screening in women at average risk 
for breast cancer. To address the issue 
of overdiagnosis (22,23), our secondary 
aim was to describe the histologic pro-
files of the additional cancers diagnosed 
with breast MR imaging screening as a 
surrogate marker for their prognostic 
importance. As a metric for the overall 
success of screening, we investigated 
the interval cancer rate associated with 
MR imaging screening.
Materials and Methods
This prospective observational study 
was conducted at two academic breast 
centers and was approved by the 
screening is associated with an inter-
val cancer rate of 30%–50%, indicating 
that between one-third and one-half of 
cancers observed in women undergo-
ing mammographic screening will not 
be detected with mammography but 
will become clinically obvious between 
screening rounds (7).
The limited sensitivity of mammo-
graphic screening and the relatively 
high interval cancer rate associated 
with it will contribute to the fact that, 
in spite of decades of mammographic 
screening, breast cancer continues to 
represent the second most important 
cause of death from cancer in women. 
This, together with the well-established 
correlation between breast density and 
diagnostic performance of screening 
mammography, has sparked interest 
in other, nonmammographic screening 
methods and has led to the fact that ra-
diologists and health care providers are 
now obliged to inform women of their 
breast density (8), although there is 
currently only limited data available on 
the utility of other, nonmammographic 
screening methods in women at average 
risk for cancer.
Ultrasonography 
(US) 
screening 
has been proposed for this purpose. In 
women with elevated risk of breast can-
cer, US has been shown to increase the 
cancer detection rate and reduce the in-
terval cancer rate. However, it is associ-
ated with a low positive predictive value 
(PPV) that may translate into substantial 
downstream costs and morbidity (9–12).
Breast magnetic resonance (MR) 
imaging has thus far been used to screen

Advances in Knowledge
 
n Supplemental MR imaging 
screening improves early diagno-
sis in women with average risk 
for breast cancer, with an addi-
tional cancer yield of 15.5 per 
1000 cases (95% confidence 
interval [CI]: 11.9, 20.0), which 
is substantially higher than that 
reported for supplemental US 
screening or supplemental digital 
breast tomosynthesis screening 
of similar cohorts.
 
n With MR imaging screening, the 
interval cancer rate in the cohort 
of 2120 women over an observa-
tion period of 7007 women-years 
was zero (95% CI: 0.0, 0.1).
 
n The positive predictive value 
(PPV) of MR imaging in this 
cohort (35.7%; 95% CI: 28.9, 
43.1) was within the range of 
PPV levels accepted for organized 
mammographic screening pro-
grams and was substantially 
higher than the PPV levels pub-
lished for US screening.
Implications for Patient Care
 
n MR imaging is a useful adjunct 
screening tool in women at av-
erage risk for breast cancer.
 
n The biologic profile of the can-
cers diagnosed with MR imaging, 
together with the absent interval 
cancer rate, suggests that can-
cers detected with MR imaging 
were prognostically relevant, sug-
gesting that MR imaging can be 
used to detect cancers that 
would have progressed to clini-
cally detectable disease.
B
reast cancer represents the most 
frequent type of noncutaneous 
cancer in the female population. 
Early onset and high incidence rates 
result in important medical and socio-
economic implications of this disease 
(1). Results from prospective random-
ized trials suggest that early diagnosis 
of breast cancer translates into reduced 
mortality from breast cancer (2,3,4). 
Mammography is therefore recom-
mended for screening women aged 
40–50 years or older.
However, 
limitations 
of 
mam-
mographic screening, particularly in 
women with dense breast tissue, are 
well established. Dense breast tissue 
decreases the sensitivity and specificity 
with which screening mammography 
is able to diagnose breast cancer. It is 
important to note that dense breast tis-
sue is not an infrequent condition; over 
half of women participating in mammo-
graphic screening programs will have 
noninvoluted intermediately dense or 
extremely dense breast tissue (5,6). 
This may explain why mammographic

BREAST IMAGING: Supplemental Breast MR Imaging Screening 
Kuhl et al
All imaging studies were read by a 
total of nine breast radiologists with 
5–18 years of experience in interpreting 
breast images (C.K.K., K.S., C.L., S.S., 
and five other radiologists who were not 
coauthors). All mammograms were inde-
pendently double read by the same group 
of breast radiologists. Conventional (ie, 
mammography and US) and MR imaging 
studies were prospectively read indepen-
dently of each other to record results of 
individual screening methods. Thereaf-
ter, conventional and MR imaging stud-
ies were read in conjunction with one 
another to decide the final management 
strategy for a given patient.
All mammograms and US and MR 
images were described and categorized 
according to the respective BI-RADS lex-
icon, and mammographic breast density 
was classified according to American 
College of Radiology (ACR) categories.
Validation of Diagnoses
Participants with BI-RADS category 1 
or 2 findings at screening were followed 
with mammography with or without US 
screening for at least another 24 months 
(mean, 26.4 months; median, 28 months; 
range, 24–38 months). Patients with BI-
RADS category 3 findings (probably be-
nign) underwent short-term follow-up 
(follow-up after 6 months) and were re-
turned to their regular study screening, 
including MR imaging screening, there-
after. Patients with suspicious findings 
(BI-RADS category 4 or 5) underwent 
vacuum-assisted biopsy with MR imaging 
guidance. Women in whom high-risk le-
sions were diagnosed at core biopsy un-
derwent additional surgical excision.
Data Analysis
The database included each partici-
pant’s age, menopausal status, clinical 
and family history, breast density, prior 
screening history, results of screening 
mammography and MR imaging, and 
results of follow-up, biopsy, and surgical 
pathology. The unit of observation was 
the individual participant. All statistical 
tests were two sided; P , .05 indicated 
a significant difference. Distribution of 
categorical values, such as menopausal 
status, breast density, or screening his-
tory in women with or without breast 
Imaging Protocol
Two-view full-field digital mammo- 
graphy (Selenia Dimensions, Hologic, 
Mass) was performed in accordance 
with national and international prac-
tice guidelines. Additional views or 
spot compression views were obtained, 
when appropriate. A computer-assisted 
detection system was available to help 
radiologists interpret the images.
Bilateral screening US was per-
formed at the discretion of the breast 
radiologist who interpreted the screen-
ing mammogram on the same day, 
and US images were read by the same 
breast radiologist. US examinations 
were conducted according to current 
practice standards with 15-MHz probes 
(IU22, Philips, Best, the Netherlands; 
3D Aixplorer, SuperSonic, Aix-en-
Provence, France).
Dynamic 
contrast 
material–en-
hanced breast MR imaging was per-
formed with 1.5-T systems (Achieva; 
Philips Medical Systems, Best, the Neth-
erlands) by using a double-breast four-
element surface coil (Invivo, Orlando, 
Fla) that included a device to immobi-
lize the breast in the craniocaudal (ie, 
section encoding) direction (Noras, 
Würzburg, Germany). The standardized 
imaging protocol consisted of an axial 
bilateral two-dimensional multisection 
gradient-echo dynamic series (repetition 
time msec/echo time msec, 250/4.6; 
flip angle, 90°) with a full 512 3 512 
acquisition matrix and a sensitivity en-
coding factor of two, performed prior 
to and four times after bolus injection 
of 0.1 mmol of gadobutrol per kilogram 
of body weight (Gadovist; Bayer, Ger-
many). In addition, an axial T2-weighted 
fast spin-echo sequence with identical 
anatomic parameters was performed. 
The entire protocol took less than 10 
minutes to perform.
Conventional and MR imaging stud-
ies had to be completed within 4 weeks. 
Mean interval between the study screen-
ing examinations (ie, mammography with 
or without US and screening MR imag-
ing) was 8 days (median, 5 days; range, 
0–28 days). Women underwent screening 
MR imaging at variable intervals (range 
12–36 months); screening intervals were 
recorded on a monthly basis.
respective institutional review boards. 
Written informed consent was ob-
tained. The recruitment period that 
started in January 2005 was completed 
in December 2013 and was followed by 
a 2-year validation period.
Breast MR imaging screening was 
offered to asymptomatic women at av-
erage risk for breast cancer. Asymp-
tomatic refers to absence of both clin-
ical and conventional imaging findings 
in the patients, and average risk re-
fers to the fact that only women who 
did not exhibit factors that are known 
to significantly increase the risk of de-
veloping breast cancer (specified later 
in this article) were included. Women 
underwent screening MR imaging 
in addition to conventional imaging 
(screening mammography and, at the 
discretion of the interpreting breast 
radiologist, screening US). After the 
last screening MR imaging exami-
nation, women returned to regular 
mammographic screening for at least 
2 years of follow-up. The database 
was closed in December 2014.
Inclusion Criteria
We included women aged 40–70 years 
with a calculated lifetime breast can-
cer risk of 6%–12% according to the 
Gail model and at least minimal resid-
ual breast tissue at screening mam-
mography (24,25). All women met 
the following criteria: (a) normal or 
benign (Breast Imaging Reporting and 
Data System [BI-RADS] category 1 or 
2) double-read digital full-field screen-
ing mammography and, if performed, 
normal screening US; (b) no clinical 
signs or symptoms of breast cancer; 
(c) no personal or family history of 
breast or ovarian cancer; (d) no history 
of a tissue diagnosis associated with 
increased risk of breast cancer, such 
as atypical ductal hyperplasia, lobular 
intraepithelial neoplasia, flat epithelial 
atypia, papilloma or papillomatosis, or 
complex sclerosing lesions; and (e) no 
personal history of chest irradiation 
(eg, for Hodgkin disease) (24,26–31). 
Women who received a new diagnosis 
of breast cancer or a high-risk lesion 
during the study were excluded from 
further participation.

substantially increased risk of subse-
quent breast cancer and thus changes 
the subsequent care of women who had 
been assumed to have average risk of 
breast cancer (26,27).
For further assessment of the prog-
nostic importance of screen-detected 
breast cancers, we recorded distribution 
of estrogen receptor–negative cancers 
versus estrgeon receptor–positive can-
cers, presence or absence of human epi-
dermal growth factor receptor 2 overex-
pression, and nuclear grading (32).
We calculated breast cancer in-
cidence by referencing the number 
of breast cancers to the number of 
women. Supplemental cancer detection 
rate was calculated by referencing the 
number of cancers detected only with 
MR imaging to the number of screening 
studies. We use the terms prevalence 
screening and incidence screening in 
spite of the fact that most women had 
already undergone screening examina-
tions prior to study entry (Table 1).
BI-RADS category 1–3 findings were 
considered negative test results, and 
BI-RADS category 4 and 5 findings 
were considered positive test results. 
The number of short-term follow-up 
recommendations (BI-RADS category 
3 diagnoses) and their final outcomes 
were recorded. Minimal cancer rate (ie, 
fraction of cancers smaller than 10 mm, 
N0 and M0) was determined. Since the 
current revision of the BI-RADS lexicon 
considers BI-RADS category 3 findings 
a positive test result, we provide an ad-
ditional calculation of diagnostic indexes 
based on BI-RADS category 3 findings as 
a positive test result (Table E1 [online]).
Malignant 
diagnoses 
(invasive 
breast cancer and ductal carcinoma 
in situ [DCIS]) were accepted as pos-
itive validation results. All other find-
ings, including high-risk lesions, were 
considered negative validation results, 
although a tissue diagnosis of atypical 
ductal hyperplasia or lobular intraepi-
thelial neoplasia is associated with a 
cancer, was compared by using the x2 
test for unpaired data.
Sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and 
negative predictive value of MR imaging 
were estimated as simple proportions 
with Clopper-Pearson 95% confidence 
intervals (CIs).
During the first (prevalence) screen-
ing round, women were selected to 
have negative screening mammograms 
with or without negative screening US 
studies, which enables calculation of 
supplemental cancer yield with MR 
imaging but does not enable a mean-
ingful comparison of sensitivities of the 
different imaging methods. During sub-
sequent screening rounds, however, a 
comparison of the sensitivities of mam-
mography, US, and MR imaging is pos-
sible. The McNemar test was used to 
compare the sensitivities of breast MR 
imaging, mammography, and US for in-
cidence screening rounds.
In accordance with the BI-RADS 
lexicon version at the time of the study,

mammography with or without US and 
MR imaging) was 8 days (median, 5 
days; range, 0–28 days).
Cancer Detection
Breast cancer was diagnosed in 61 of 
the 2120 participants, yielding an over-
all breast cancer incidence of 28.7 per 
1000 
cases 
(95% 
CI: 
22.4, 
36.8; 
Table 
2). 
 
Forty-eight cancers were diagnosed in 
the initial screening round (prevalence 
screening, 2120 examinations); the 
remaining 13 were diagnosed during 
the subsequent screening rounds (in-
cidence screening, 1741 examinations) 
that covered an observation period of 
4887 women-years.
Sixty of 61 cancers were detected 
with breast MR imaging only, as fol-
lows: In accordance with study inclu-
sion criteria (ie, negative conventional 
Demographic details, past screen-
ing history, use of conventional imaging 
during the study, and distribution of 
mammographic breast densities were 
similar for the entire cohort and for 
the cohort of women in whom breast 
cancer was diagnosed during the study 
(Table 1). The mean age and median 
age of participants (53.8 years and 53 
years, respectively) corresponded to 
those of our regular screening cohort. 
The majority of women (1373 [64.8%] 
of 2120) had undergone prior screening 
with both mammography and US, and 
1335 (62.9%) women continued to un-
dergo screening with these modalities 
during the study. The last screening

performed on average 24.6 months be-
fore inclusion. Mean interval between

To analyze the influence of breast 
density on supplemental cancer de-
tection, we used the Mann-Whitney 
test to compare the distribution of 
breast densities in the overall cohort 
with that of women with supplemen-
tal breast cancers diagnosed only with 
MR imaging.
Screening implies periodic exam-
ination of the same individuals over 
time, leading to repeated observa-
tions in the same women. To account 
for this, one would describe a possi-
ble correlation structure by fitting a 
multivariate (eg, logistic regression) 
model. However, because of the very 
low number of discordant observations 
made in the same individuals in this 
study, such modeling was considered 
inappropriate.
Interval cancer rate was deter-
mined by analyzing the number of 
women who received a diagnosis of 
breast cancer based on clinical signs 
or symptoms of breast cancer in be-
tween screening rounds.
Results
Screening Population
A total of 2181 women fulfilled the en-
trance criteria. Of these, 61 were ex-
cluded because of insufficient follow-up. 
Accordingly, the study cohort consisted 
of 2120 women who underwent 3861 
regular screening MR imaging stud-
ies, which covered an observation pe-
riod of 7007 women-years. Of the 2120 
women, 1099 (51.8%) underwent only 
one screening round (and 2-year fol-
low-up); this included 68 women in 
whom breast cancer or high-risk le-
sion was diagnosed at the first screen-
ing MR imaging examination and who 
were excluded from further screening 
participation. A total of 1021 women 
underwent several screening rounds as 
follows: 541 (25.5%) underwent two 
screening rounds, 288 (13.6%) un-
derwent three, 156 (7.4%) underwent 
four, 24 (1.1%) underwent five, and 12 
(0.6%) underwent six.
In addition, 175 women underwent 
175 MR imaging studies for manage-
ment of BI-RADS category 3 diagnoses.

BREAST IMAGING: Supplemental Breast MR Imaging Screening 
Kuhl et al
detection rate of 7.5 per 1000 cases (13 of 
1741). Mammographic screening enabled 
us to identify one of the 13 cancers, for 
a sensitivity of 7.7% (95% CI: 0.2, 36.0) 
and a cancer-detection-rate of 0.5 per 
1000 cases (one of 1741) (95% CI: 0.0, 
3.2). Screening US had been performed 
in 11 of the 13 women with breast cancer 
and had yielded positive findings in one, 
yielding a sensitivity of 8.3% (one of 11) 
(95% CI: 0.2, 41.2) and a cancer detec-
tion rate of 0.7 per 1000 cases (one of 
1083) (95% CI: 0.0, 5.1). The difference 
in sensitivities and cancer detection rates 
of MR imaging versus mammography and 
US was significant (P , .001) (Fig 1).
Types and Biologic Profiles of Cancers
Invasive breast cancer was diagnosed 
in 41 women (Table 2) (median size, 8 
mm; range, 2–22 mm), and DCIS was 
diagnosed in 20 (median size, 15 mm; 
range, 6–55 mm). Four women had 
node-positive cancer, which was de-
tected at prevalence screening in three 
women and at incident screening in one 
woman. None of the women had distant 
metastases. Minimal cancer rate was 
71% (34 of 48) at prevalence screen-
ing and 85% (11 of 13) at incidence 
screening. Of the 61 malignant lesions, 
26 (43%) exhibited high nuclear grades 
(95% CI: 30.0, 55.9), with persis-
tently high rates at incidence screening 
(46%); there were 20 (33%) (95% CI: 
21, 46) estrogen receptor– and proges-
terone receptor–negative cancers.
Specificity and False-Positive Diagnoses
A total of 175 MR imaging studies 
(4.9%) were categorized as BI-RADS 
category 3; the rate was 5.7% at prev-
alence screening and 3.2% at incidence 
screening. To settle BI-RADS category 
3 diagnoses (ie, downgrade the findings 
to BI-RADS category 2), one short-term 
follow-up MR imaging examination was 
sufficient in 172 (98.3%) patients.
A total of 171 (4.4%) MR imaging 
studies were categorized as suspicious 
(BI-RADS category 4 or 5). Biopsy re-
vealed benign changes in 68 (39.8%) 
of 171 women, high-risk lesions in 
42 (24.6%), and breast cancer in 61 
(35.7%). This translates into a speci-
ficity of 97.1%, a false-positive rate of 
Average time until occurrence of in-
cident breast cancer was 34.9 months 
(median, 37.5 months; age range, 25–49 
months). None of the screening partici-
pants developed an interval cancer, and 
none received a diagnosis of breast can-
cer during the 2-year follow-up after the 
last study screening round, yielding an 
interval cancer rate of 0 (95% CI: 0, 0.1).
Comparison of Sensitivity and Cancer 
Detection Rates of MR Imaging versus 
Mammography and US during Incidence 
Screening
Of the 1021 women who completed more 
than one screening round, all 1021 un-
derwent MR imaging and mammography 
for a total of 1741 incidence rounds. A 
total of 753 women underwent screen-
ing US in addition to mammography and 
MR imaging, for a total of 1083 incidence 
rounds. We identified 13 breast cancers 
during the 1741 incidence screening 
rounds. MR imaging was positive in 13 
of the 13 cancers, yielding a sensitivity of 
100.0% (95% CI: 75.3, 100) and a cancer 
imaging), all 48 breast cancers detect-
ed in the prevalence screening round 
were detected with breast MR imag-
ing only. During the 1741 subsequent 
(incidence) screening rounds, in which 
screening was performed with MR im-
aging and mammography, with or with-
out US in parallel, 12 of the 13 inci-
dence screening cancers were detected 
with breast MR imaging only. One of 
the 13 incidence screening cancers, a 
clinically occult pT1c invasive cancer, 
was detected with MR imaging, as well 
as with mammography and US, at a 
regular 36-month screening visit. None 
of the incidence cancers were detected 
with mammography and US only.
This yields a supplemental cancer 
detection rate for MR imaging screen-
ing of 15.5 per 1000 cases overall, with 
rates of 22.6 per 1000 cases for preva-
lence screening and 6.9 per 1000 cases 
for incidence screening. Invasive cancer 
detection rate was 14.2 per 1000 cases 
at prevalence screening and 6.3 per 1000 
cases at incidence screening (Table 3).

(ie, by tissue alterations that directly 
correlate with carcinogenesis, cell prolif-
eration, and metastatic growth), which 
is consistent with the role of dynamic 
contrast-enhanced MR imaging as an 
imaging biomarker (35–39). Cancers 
missed at mammographic screening 
(ie, the so-called interval cancers) are 
known to exhibit similar biologic profiles 
(40–42). Expected or accepted inter-
val cancer rates in European mammo-
graphic screening programs range from 
30% to 50% of cancers observed in 
screening participants (7). In contrast, 
in this cohort of 2120 women followed 
for more than 7007 women-years, the 
interval cancer rate was 0%. This, to-
gether with the biologic profile of can-
cers detected, suggests that MR imaging 
enables us to anticipate the diagnosis of 
cancers which, had they remained un-
diagnosed, would have progressed to 
cause more advanced interval cancers, 
or mammographically visible cancers 
later on. Accordingly, these observations 
argue against the interpretation that the 
additional cancers diagnosed with MR 
imaging are indolent cancers (ie, consti-
tute overdiagnosis). Moreover, it is well 
established that the reservoir of cancers 
in the population that will eventually be-
come clinically evident is much higher 
than the annual incidence observed with 
regular, mammographic screening (43).
cohort of women with elevated risk of 
cancer (14.8 per 1000 cases) (34).
Since we aimed to investigate the 
supplemental cancer yield of MR imag-
ing, the first screening round included 
only women with negative screening 
mammograms and US studies. However, 
also during the 1741 subsequent screen-
ing rounds, 12 of the total 13 incidence 
screening cancers were detected with 
MR imaging alone; none were detected 
with mammography only or US only. 
This is in good agreement with trials in 
women at high risk for cancer who were 
undergoing MR imaging for screening 
and in whom the contribution of mam-
mography to the overall cancer yield was 
limited (15,16). Further studies should 
therefore investigate whether it is con-
ceivable to use MR imaging as a replace-
ment for, rather than as an addition to, 
screening mammography.
Additional breast cancers diagnosed 
with MR imaging were small (median 
size, 8 mm), mostly node negative 
(93.4%), and tended to exhibit an ad-
verse biologic profile: Cancers detected 
with MR imaging corresponded to dedif-
ferentiated high-grade lesions in almost 
half of the cases. On pathophysiologic 
grounds, this is plausible. Detectabil-
ity of a cancer at dynamic contrast-
enhanced MR imaging is determined 
by its angiogenic and protease activity 
2.9%, and a PPV (of recommendation to 
biopsy) of 35.7% (Table 3).
Distribution of Breast Densities in Women 
with Supplemental Breast Cancer
The distribution of breast densities in 
women with supplemental cancers di-
agnosed with breast MR imaging only 
did not differ from the distribution of 
breast densities in the entire cohort 
(Table 1, Fig 2).
Discussion
Breast cancer continues to represent 
a leading cause of cancer death in 
women. Mammographic screening has 
been shown to be useful in the reduc-
tion of breast cancer mortality; how-
ever, the limitations of mammographic 
screening, particularly in women with 
dense or noninvoluted breasts, are well 
established. This has led an increas-
ing number of authorities to mandate 
that radiologists inform women of their 
breast density and its implications (8). 
So far, however, there are limited data 
on the utility and diagnostic accuracy 
of supplemental screening methods 
in women with average risk of breast 
cancer. Candidate methods are digital 
breast tomosynthesis, breast US, and 
contrast-enhanced MR imaging.
In this prospective observational 
study, we provide evidence that MR 
imaging is useful for supplemental 
screening in women with average risk 
of cancer who exhibit a range of breast 
densities and that it is superior to 
breast US for this purpose. MR imag-
ing screening helped identify additional 
breast cancers that were not detected 
with digital mammography or breast US 
in a substantial number of individuals, 
with an average supplemental cancer 
yield of 15.5 per 1000 cases. This is a 
substantially higher supplemental can-
cer detection rate than that published 
for supplemental digital breast tomo-
synthesis screening (1.2 per 1000 cases) 
(33) or supplemental US screening of 
women with elevated risk of breast can-
cer (3.5–4.4 per 1000 cases) (9,10). It 
is in close agreement with results for 
a single round of MR imaging screen-
ing in the ACR Imaging Network 6666

were chosen to consider all aspects that, 
at the time of study design, were known 
to increase a woman’s risk of breast can-
cer, we could not exclude a recruitment 
bias. Some aspects of a woman’s his-
tory or prior imaging findings may have 
prompted her to decide to enroll in this 
study. In accordance with the BI-RADS 
lexicon that guided image interpretation 
at the time of data accrual, in our co-
hort, a BI-RADS category 3 diagnosis 
was considered a negative result. In the 
current BI-RADS lexicon, this has been 
changed so that a BI-RADS category 3 
diagnosis is now considered a positive 
result, which lowers the resulting PPV; 
however, it may also affect the reading 
behavior of radiologists. Further stud-
ies are needed to address the issue of 
cost-effectiveness of MR imaging screen-
ing. Finally, our study did not yield evi-
dence on the effect on disease-specific or 
overall survival. The supplemental can-
cer yield and the type of additional can-
cers detected with MR imaging and the 
absence of interval cancers in our cohort 
may, however, be used to model possible 
effects on breast cancer survival.
In conclusion, our study suggests 
that MR imaging screening improves 
early diagnosis of biologically relevant 
breast cancer in women with average 
risk of breast cancer and was associated 
with an interval cancer rate of zero. 
Specificity and false-positive rate of MR 
imaging were high and corresponded to 
the respective values observed in mam-
mographic screening programs. When 
compared with supplemental US for 
screening, MR imaging offers a substan-
tially higher cancer detection rate and 
greater sensitivity and, when compared 
with previously published results, it also 
offers a higher specificity and PPV
. Thus, 
our results suggest that MR imaging can 
serve as a useful supplemental screening 
tool in women at average risk for breast 
cancer, especially those with dense 
mammographic tissue.

The specificity and PPV of MR im-
aging screening in this study was high; 
in 35.7% of cases, the PPV matched 
the PPV observed for mammographic 
screening (range, 25%–40%) (7). In 
comparison, the published PPV of 
screening US is substantially lower 
(range, 8.4%–11.7%) (9–12).
After a negative MR imaging screen-
ing study, on average, the first screening 
diagnosis of breast cancer was not made 
until almost 3 years later. This suggests 
that the protective shadow of MR imag-
ing screening, in other words, a screen-
ing interval that results in low risk of an 
interval cancer in most women, may last 
longer than values observed for mam-
mographic screening (44). If confirmed 
in future trials, this may imply that MR 
imaging screening may permit longer 
screening intervals to maintain a low 
rate of interval cancers.
Although the direct costs associ-
ated with MR imaging vary widely be-
tween countries, it is clearly one of the 
most cost-intensive medical imaging 
methods. Future cost-benefit analyses 
must consider the low interval cancer 
rate of screening MR imaging, as well 
as the possible downstream savings 
secondary to earlier diagnosis of bio-
logically aggressive cancers. Analyses 
also must consider that supplemental 
MR imaging screening avoids recall 
(ie, inviting women with equivocal or 
suspicious 
screening 
mammograms 
for diagnostic assessment), which is 
an important driver of overall costs of 
mammographic screening programs. 
Moreover, additional costs could in 
part be compensated for if further 
studies enable us to confirm that MR 
imaging screening enables use of wider 
screening intervals. Finally, abbreviated 
breast MR imaging enables MR imaging 
screening without compromising diag-
nostic accuracy and may allow a sub-
stantial reduction in the cost associated 
with breast MR imaging (45).
A limitation of our study was that 
screening studies were read by special-
ized breast radiologists. Our results may 
not be transferrable to a community level 
until more radiologists gain practical ex-
perience in reading breast MR screening 
studies. Although our inclusion criteria
