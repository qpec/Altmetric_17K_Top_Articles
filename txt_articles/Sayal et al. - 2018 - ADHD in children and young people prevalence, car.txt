Summary
Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a common childhood behavioural
disorder – systematic reviews indicate that the community prevalence of ADHD globally is
between 2% to 7%, with an average of around 5%. In addition, a further 5% of children have
significant difficulties with over-activity, inattention and impulsivity that are just sub-threshold
to meet full diagnostic criteria for ADHD. Estimates of the administrative (clinically diagnosed
and/or recorded) prevalence vary worldwide and although increasing over time, ADHD is still
relatively under-recognised and under-diagnosed in most countries, particularly in girls and
older children. ADHD often persists into adulthood and is a risk factor for other mental health
disorders and negative outcomes including educational under-achievement, difficulties with
employment and relationships, and criminality. The timely recognition and treatment of
children with ADHD-type difficulties provides an opportunity to improve their long-term
outcomes. This review includes a systematic review of the community and administrative
prevalence of ADHD in children and adolescents; an overview of the barriers to accessing care
for ADHD; a description of costs associated with ADHD; and a broad discussion of evidence-
based pathways for the delivery of clinical care, including a focus on key issues for two specific
age groups - pre-school children and adolescents requiring transition of care from child to adult
services.

Background
Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a common childhood behavioural
disorder, estimated to affect around 3-5% of children.1 The diagnosis of ADHD is based on
pervasive, developmentally excessive and impairing levels of over-activity, inattention and
impulsivity. At least a further 5% of children have significant difficulties with these behaviours
that are just sub-threshold to meet full diagnostic criteria. ADHD often persists into adulthood
and is a risk factor for a wide range of other mental health problems including defiant,
disruptive, and antisocial behaviours, emotional problems, self-harm and substance misuse as
well as broader negative outcomes such as educational under-achievement and exclusion from
school, difficulties with employment and relationships, and criminality.2-4 For health, education
and social care services, the timely and appropriate recognition and treatment of children with
ADHD-type difficulties provides an opportunity to enhance their long-term outcomes. This
review comprises a systematic review of the community and administrative prevalence of
ADHD in children and adolescents; an overview of the barriers to accessing care; a description
of costs associated with ADHD; and a discussion of evidence-based pathways and the delivery
of clinical care, with consideration of specific issues relating to two age groups (pre-school
children and adolescents requiring transition into adult services). Although ADHD treatments
are not discussed in detail, key approaches to intervention are outlined as they apply to care
pathways.
Prevalence of ADHD
Community prevalence
Community prevalence describes the number of people with ADHD in a representative
population sample, according to predefined criteria. A series of searches (see Panel) identified
seven systematic review articles reporting on the community prevalence of ADHD.
The first review (Polanczyk) estimated the global prevalence of ADHD as 5.29%.5 Based on
DSM-IV criteria and using symptoms from parent ratings, teacher ratings or best estimate
diagnostic procedures, Willcutt estimated a prevalence of 5.9%-7.1% amongst children and
adolescents.6 In contrast, Erskine et al’s meta-analysis adopted a more conservative approach
by applying a greater weight to studies where information was required from more than one
 3
informant and also included a higher proportion of 12-18 years olds than the Polanczyk
review.7 They estimated the global prevalence of ADHD amongst 5-19 year olds as 2.2%, with
a peak prevalence at the age of 9 years. Polanczyk et al. updated their previous review,
including 154 studies using either DSM or ICD diagnostic criteria in people aged 18 or under,
and concluded that the world-wide community prevalence of ADHD is approximately 5%.8
Variation in estimated prevalence was best explained by methodological differences between
studies so that when similar methodologies are adopted there was no obvious variation between
different geographical locations. Neither were there differences by study year, suggesting that
the community prevalence of ADHD has remained stable over the last three decades. Using
prevalence data from their previous review (the Global Burden of Disease Study 2010),7
Erskine et al conducted a further systematic review to estimate the disability adjusted life years
(DALYs) related to ADHD. ADHD was reported to contribute 491,500 DALYs, making it the
98th highest cause for global burden. The number of DALYs for ADHD peaked at ages 10-14
years and was higher for males. As part of a broader meta-analysis of the worldwide prevalence
of mental disorders in children and adolescents, Polanczyk et al. estimated the prevalence of
ADHD in 6-18 year olds as 3.4% (95% CI 2.6 to 4.5) with heterogeneity in methods between
studies cited as a reason for different prevalence estimates.10 The final review, by Thomas et
al., included studies in any language which used DSM-III, DSM-III-R or DSM-IV criteria.11
The overall prevalence was reported as 7.2% (95% CI 6.7 to 7.8) with studies from Europe
reporting lower prevalence estimates than those from North America and few studies using
random population sampling. Collectively, these systematic reviews suggest that the reported
range in the community prevalence of ADHD (between 2.2% and 7.2%) reflects variation in
study methodology.
Administrative (clinically recorded) prevalence
This reflects the number of people with clinically diagnosed and/or recorded ADHD as a
proportion of the whole population i.e. the prevalence of diagnosis made in practice.12 These
figures, when considered alongside other factors such as community prevalence and the
availability and use of services, can inform the planning of service provision to address any
significant discrepancies that might emerge. However, many studies have estimated
administrative prevalence using only prescription data. These require careful and cautious
interpretation as a number of factors can influence both the prescription and uptake of
medication treatments for ADHD, after a clinical diagnosis has been made. The balance
 4
between the use of pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatment options for ADHD
varies greatly both between and within different countries. In general, however, studies that
only report prescription data are likely to reflect an under-estimate of the true administrative
prevalence. A series of searches (see Panel) identified 55 papers reporting on the administrative
prevalence of ADHD.
In the US, whilst it is difficult to make direct comparisons between studies (Table 1)13-37
because of differences in how administrative prevalence was defined and estimated, the
administrative prevalence based on prescriptions ranged from 0.6% (in under 18 year-olds in
1987)32 to 10% (in 7-11 year-olds in 1995-1996).31 The latter figure is higher than other studies
from that time and may reflect a regional variation. The administrative prevalence based on
diagnosis ranged from 0.93% (in 2-5 year-olds in 2002)20 to 11.0% (in 4-17 year olds in 2003
to 2011).18The pattern of an increase in the prevalence of ADHD over time was reported across
studies with a peak involving the 10-14 year age group.
Table 1 about here
Table 2 summarises studies conducted in the UK.38-44 None of these studies estimated the
administrative prevalence of ADHD based only on diagnosis. Based on prescriptions, the
prevalence ranged from 0.003% (in under 19 year-olds in 1992)43 to 0.92% (in 6-12 year-olds
in 2008).40The administrative prevalence based on prescriptions with/without diagnosis ranged
from 0.19% (in 6-17 year-olds in 1998)39 to 0.76% (in 5-15 year-olds in 2011-2012).38 Using
the Health Improvement Network (THIN) primary care database, the prevalence of ADHD
between 2003 to 2008 was estimated as 0.73% in 6-12 year-olds, 0.57% in 13-17 year-olds and
0.06% in 18-24 year-olds.40 This trend for decreasing prescriptions has been noted after the age
of 15 years.41 Although the administrative prevalence of ADHD has increased over time, there
is some suggestion that this has now levelled off, for example a UK study using the Clinical
Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) suggested that the prevalence of diagnosed ADHD has
decreased since 2007.39
Table 2 about here
Table 3 summarises studies conducted globally outside the US or UK.45-67 In all countries
except Israel the administrative prevalence estimates were lower than in the US. The
administrative prevalence based on prescriptions ranged from 0.06 (in 5-17 year olds in 2010-
2011)47 to 2.5% (in under 18 year-olds in 2004).65 The administrative prevalence based on
 5
diagnosis ranged from 0.06% (under 18 year-olds in 1996)62 to 12.6% (in 6-13 year-olds in
2003 to 2009).56 Two studies using Israeli health insurance data reported relatively high
prevalence estimates in Kibbutzim areas - 5.99% based on prescriptions;66 12.6% based on
diagnosis.56 It is possible that these high estimates reflect a selected population of people with
access to health insurance that are not reflective of the wider population, especially since the
reported prevalence of ADHD based on prescriptions was 0.20% in Arab areas.66

Differences by sex
Although ADHD is more common in males than females with a ratio of 2-3:1 reported in
community prevalence studies,the sex ratio is consistently greater in administrative prevalence
studies. This suggests a relative under-recognition of ADHD in females.6,7 For example, a UK
study conducted using THIN data (2010-2012) concluded that males are five times more likely
to be diagnosed with ADHD than females and a study based on diagnosis and prescription data
from Germany estimated a 3-4 times greater administrative prevalence in males than
females.38,61 A study from the Netherlands estimated that 3-8 times more boys than girls
received prescriptions for ADHD and suggested that the administrative prevalence of ADHD
has been rising faster in boys.68 In the UK, a study using prescriptions data from the CPRD
estimated that, amongst under 19 year-olds, the male to female ratio of the prevalence of
ADHD increased over time between 1992 and 2001.43 In contrast, other studies from the US,
Switzerland, the Netherlands and Sweden have suggested a more rapid increase in females than
males.24,62,58,69 Similarly, a study of 6-17 year olds using CPRD diagnoses and prescriptions
data showed that the male to female ratio has reduced over time, ranging from 8.4 in 1999 to
5.8 in 2009.39 In another study, using THIN data, the male to female ratio also reduced from
6.6 in 2003 to 5.5 in 2008 in people aged 6-12 years and from 9.8 (2003) to 6.3 (2008) in people
aged 13-17 years.40 Collectively, these studies suggest that the initial increase in prescribing
prevalence was mainly in males but that, in more recent years, prescribing has also increased
for females.
Differences by socio-economic deprivation
A few studies have stratified estimates of community prevalence of ADHD according to socio-
economic deprivation.6 These studies indicate that individuals from families defined as more
 6
deprived were between 1.5-4 times more likely to have ADHD than individuals from less
deprived families. In contrast, there are mixed findings, particularly from the US, on the
association between the administrative prevalence of ADHD and deprivation. For example, a
nationwide survey reported that areas with greater levels of deprivation have a higher
administrative prevalence of ADHD (based on parent report of clinical diagnosis) compared to
areas with lower levels of deprivation.70 Similarly, a study of primary school children found
that children from the lowest income quintile had the greatest probability of being reported to
have a clinical diagnosis of ADHD compared to the middle income quintile.71 However, some
US-based studies have suggested a greater prevalence of childhood ADHD amongst families
with a higher income.72,73 Although this association was not explained by the availability of
health insurance,73 it is less clear how the administrative prevalence of ADHD varies according
to private and public health insurance status. For example, a household survey with pharmacy
data on 2.8 million children and adolescents found a drug-treated prevalence of ADHD of 1.3%
amongst those without insurance, 3.4% with private insurance and 4.3% with public
insurance.22 Studies from countries where access to healthcare is more universally available
have generally confirmed an association between the administrative prevalence of ADHD and
deprivation.74-76
Barriers to care
As noted above, the community prevalence of ADHD globally is estimated to be between 2-
7%, with an average of around 5%, and a suggestion that most of the variation reflects
methodological differences across studies rather than a true variation between different regions.
Estimates of the administrative prevalence also vary worldwide, with the highest estimates
coming from the US and Israel. Although the community prevalence of ADHD has remained
stable over time, its administrative prevalence has been increasing. This is likely to reflect
better identification and awareness of the condition and improved access to treatment in
countries where under-diagnosis has been an issue but may, in some instances, reflect over-
diagnosis. These overall figures also mask regional variations within countries. There are
particular concerns about rates of prescribing in some parts of the US as these far exceed what
would be expected from epidemiological data.77,78 This may reflect sub-threshold difficulties
being diagnosed and treated as ADHD. Data from other countries mainly indicate that ADHD
is still relatively under-recognised and under-diagnosed, particularly in girls and older children.
 7
For example, two reviews of ADHD care across Scotland reported low rates of diagnosis with
minimal increases over time (0.6% of school-aged children in 2007 and 0.7% in 2012) and ten-
fold variations between regions.79,80 Patterns of prescribing of ADHD medications also show
significant regional variations across the US,21 Scotland81 and Australia82 amongst others.
In the UK, national data from 2004 suggested that less than half of children with ADHD have
been diagnosed and receive treatment.83 However, this picture of under-diagnosis co-exists
alongside some societal and media concerns about increases in methylphenidate prescribing in
the UK.84 A closer look at prescribing trends in the UK suggests that whilst prescription rates
have increased considerably over the past 20 years, the actual rates of prescribing remain much
lower than one would predict from the epidemiological data.40,41 Furthermore, the rate of
increase in prescribing has slowed considerably in recent years.39 Under-recognition of ADHD
in many countries may reflect particular barriers to care for these children and young people.
A systematic review of the international literature highlighted that barriers operate at multiple
levels, including identification of need and entry into care.85 Socio-demographic factors
identified as barriers to accessing care included female gender, older age, non-white ethnicity,
rural residence and lower family socio-economic status. The importance of enhancing
knowledge about ADHD amongst parents, teachers and primary care clinicians and the need
to reduce ADHD-related stigma were noted. The review recommended that interventions that
enhance the knowledge of and communication between these key adults may improve access
to care. Streamlining care pathways (e.g. liaison and consultation models between primary
healthcare professionals, specialist education professionals and specialist children’s health
services) may also help to overcome barriers to access.85
Costs of ADHD
ADHD has a huge impact on the lives of affected children and their families. As well as direct
use of health, specialist education, social care, and criminal justice services, the wider costs to
society also reflect impacts on parental employment and mental health, family-borne expenses,
and crime and offending.
A review of the US literature on the cost of illness related to ADHD has emphasised the
considerable and persistent costs incurred at both the individual and societal level.86 In the US,
 8
the total annual costs have been estimated at between $143billion-$266billion. The majority of
these costs were attributable to family members of people with ADHD or to adults with ADHD;
the economic impact being approximately three times greater for affected adults compared to
children and adolescents. The cost burden mainly related to healthcare and educational services
for children and loss of income and productivity for adults.
In the UK, the impact on educational services has been confirmed in longitudinal studies. Data
from the nationally representative British Child and Adolescent Mental Health survey were
assessed for resource use and estimated costings over a three year follow-up period.87 Children
with hyperkinetic disorder (using ICD-10) incurred greater costs than children with emotional
disorders, mainly relating to the use of frontline and special educational services. In England
and Wales, in 2006, basic NHS costs for ADHD (excluding medication) were estimated at £23
million for initial specialist assessment and £14 million annually for follow-up care.88 For 2012,
drug costs for ADHD in England were estimated to exceed £78 million.89 A study conducted
using the CPRD estimated that the mean annual total healthcare costs for people with ADHD
were higher than for people without (£1,327 vs. £328 per year, in the first year of the study).39
Another UK study estimated resource use costs in relation to a sample of 12-18 year olds who
were referred to specialist healthcare services and received a clinical diagnosis of ADHD five
years earlier.90 Based on 2010 prices, the estimated annual total costs to the NHS, social care,
and education services were estimated at £670 million. The majority (76%) of the mental
health-related costs fell to the education sector.
Evidence is also emerging from longitudinal studies about the long-term cost impacts of
childhood attention and hyperactivity problems, even if sub-threshold to meet full ADHD
diagnostic criteria. Over an 11-22 year follow-up period, when compared with controls, a
community sample of pre-school children at risk of ADHD had 17.6 times higher average costs
per annum across most domains (apart from non-mental health costs).91 Attention and
hyperactivity problems at the age of 10 are associated with lower levels of employment and
earnings at age 30.92 Another community-based 20 year follow-up study highlighted the
importance of comorbid conduct problems in childhood in terms of incurring recent costs
related to receipt of state benefits and use of general health and social care services.93 Delays
in receiving a clinical diagnosis of ADHD also result in greater long-term costs - individuals
with ADHD who were not diagnosed until adulthood cost 13,608 euros more per year than
their same-sex sibling.94

Evidence-based Care Pathways
Diagnostic controversies and difficulties
Even in countries where ADHD is now more generally accepted, ADHD remains a
controversial diagnosis in society and also amongst some professionals who work with children
e.g. clinicians, teachers, and social care professionals. This is in contrast to other
neurodevelopmental conditions such as autism where the diagnosis is often less contentious.
Whilst these concerns are often lumped together they actually reflect a range of quite distinct
issues. These include the lack of any specific objective tests to diagnose ADHD, the fact that
ADHD symptoms reflect the extreme end of a spectrum that spans the entire population, the
perception of a somewhat arbitrary cut-off for symptoms and impairment that itself requires a
degree of individual judgement, the broadening of the diagnostic criteria over time, variation
amongst clinicians and services in rates of diagnosis and the use of medication (in particular,
stimulant medications) for ADHD. The absence of a diagnostic test for ADHD does not,
however, invalidate the diagnosis. This issue applies to all psychiatric disorders and many
physical conditions such as hypertension.95 Compared to other psychiatric disorders in the
DSM5 field trials, the assessment of ADHD was one of the most reliable diagnoses with a
pooled test-retest reliability (intra-class kappa) across sites of 0.61. This was only exceeded by
major neurocognitive disorder (0.78) and autism (0.69) and was much higher than the figures
for disorders such as schizophrenia (0.46), bipolar disorder (0.56), major depressive disorder
(0.28) and generalized anxiety disorder (0.20). Data from routine clinical practice (involving a
clinical sample of 502 cases) in the UK indicated that, although some ADHD cases are missed
(false negatives), the only 'false positive' case was one that had become sub-threshold following
appropriate treatment.96 Based on the evidence outlined above, although there appears to be an
issue with over-diagnosis in some parts of the US with the risk of misdiagnosis (false positives)
if clinicians take short-cuts during assessment, the diagnosis of ADHD can be made both
accurately and reliably if the assessment is conducted carefully using standardised approaches.1
Whilst the recommendations of published ADHD guidelines are on one level very clear and
consistent,1,97-101 clinicians often complain that guidelines are still somewhat vague,
particularly in relation to assessment and diagnosis.102 Many clinicians perceive the assessment
and diagnostic decision-making processes to be inherently complicated as it requires both time
 10
and experience to piece together information gathered.102 From an applied health research
perspective, there is a need to understand whether interventions that assist clinicians in
optimising the assessment and diagnostic decision-making process also improve the clinical
outcomes of children and adolescents with ADHD.
Within child psychology and psychiatry there is also an ongoing debate about whether some
of those cases currently diagnosed as having ADHD would actually be better understood using
an attachment or trauma paradigm and vice versa.103 However, this is not an either/or debate
and there are strong theoretical reasons why these disorders may often co-exist. However, it is
a question that has been relatively neglected by researchers and merits further attention.
Service Organisation
In addition to the variability in administrative prevalence noted above, there are also
considerable global differences in the way that clinical care for ADHD is organised.104
Although this partly reflects general differences between healthcare systems (e.g. the balance
between public and privately funded systems), there are also historical and cultural differences
in the acceptance of ADHD as a valid disorder and of pharmacological and non-
pharmacological treatments for child and adolescent mental health problems in general and
ADHD more specifically.
In the UK, diagnosis is normally made by paediatric or child and adolescent psychiatry
specialists within secondary healthcare, depending on locally agreed care pathways. Although
these physicians usually work within the context of a multi-disciplinary team, the involvement
of non-medical professionals in the assessment process varies considerably according to local
service organisation and structures. Ongoing care and treatment is supervised by secondary
care with shared care arrangements for medication prescribing, in some places, with primary
care. In the US, where much healthcare provision is delivered privately, ADHD is generally
managed by primary care paediatricians or child and adolescent psychiatrists working in
relative isolation with few cases managed within a multi-disciplinary team. ADHD is now
generally recognised as a valid and important disorder in some parts of the world including
North America, northern Europe and several other regions. However, there are still many
countries including much of Africa, Asia, Central and South America and parts of Southern
Europe where ADHD is less well accepted, rates of recognition remain low and the scant
 11
resources available for treatment tend to be mainly focused on teaching hospital or tertiary
centres rather than in community settings. Where service access is limited, telehealth service
delivery models for managing ADHD can be effective and merit further investigation around
their acceptability and cost-effectiveness.105
Clinical Guidelines and Treatment Recommendations
There are now a broad range of evidence-based guidelines, mainly from North America and
Europe, addressing both the assessment and management of ADHD.1,97-101 The most notable
aspect about these guidelines is that, despite the different international traditions and
perspectives on ADHD noted above and different approaches to their development, they are
very similar in their recommendations for assessment and many aspects of treatment. They all
agree that assessment should be relatively structured and comprehensive, including assessment
of general functioning and comorbid disorders in addition to the core ADHD assessment.
Although they all recognise the potential importance of both pharmacological and non-
pharmacological treatment approaches for ADHD, the main area of divergence relates to the
order in which treatments should be offered to those with a new diagnosis. North American
guidelines generally recommend that medication should be considered as a first-line treatment
in most cases whereas guidelines from Europe suggest that, whilst medication is appropriate
as an initial treatment for more severe cases, behavioural management approaches should be
offered first for less severe cases. These recommendations reflect a more conservative approach
towards medication in Europe as well as data from the Multimodal Treatment of ADHD (MTA)
randomised controlled trial (RCT) which suggested that, for symptom reduction, medication
was superior to behavioural treatment for those with more severe ADHD but that the
differences were less striking for less severe cases.106
However, it is likely that these decisions will need to be re-assessed on the basis of a series of
carefully conducted meta-analyses.107,108 These analyses suggest that, when considering
outcomes from the perspective of a probably blinded informant, behavioural treatments appear
to improve parenting and conduct problems but are relatively ineffective at reducing ADHD
symptoms. In contrast to these analyses, even the most conservative approaches to assessing
the effectiveness of pharmacological treatments for children and adolescents with ADHD
suggest moderate to large effect sizes with respect to ADHD symptoms in school-age children.
Although this has been replicated across a number of systematic reviews, a Cochrane review
 12
that also reported moderate to high effect sizes for methylphenidate urged caution in its use.109
This conclusion was based on the authors’ interpretation of the risk of bias in the included
studies which, in their view, resulted in a very low quality of evidence. This is in direct contrast
to the conclusions of NICE which rated the evidence to be of moderate to high quality.1 Several
aspects of the methodology and authors’ interpretation of this Cochrane review have been
challenged.110-112 These reviews also highlight that whilst ADHD medications are associated
with a range of non-serious adverse effects there is as yet little evidence for serious adverse
events. Whilst these data are encouraging, they refer in general to relatively short-term effects
from highly structured RCTs that are unlikely to accurately reflect usual clinical practice. There
are, however, encouraging data which support the positive effects of ADHD medications on
more naturalistic measures of outcome.4,113,114 There remains a poverty of data regarding the
longer-term benefits and risks associated with drug treatments for ADHD. In part, this reflects
the inherent difficulties associated with collecting such data, particularly in terms of running
long-term RCTs of ADHD medications, and with interpreting data from long-term
observational studies that lack a comparison group. Looked at collectively, the evidence
suggests that whilst behavioural treatments are likely to benefit many children with ADHD,
they are less likely to reduce ADHD symptoms. It would therefore seem appropriate, at least
for school-aged children, to consider medication as a first-line treatment as part of a
comprehensive treatment package that will often include non-pharmacological interventions.
Implementing guidelines into practice
Relatively little is known about how well ADHD guidelines are implemented into routine
clinical practice. However, in Scotland, there have been two national reviews of adherence to
the SIGN guidelines for ADHD. The first review highlighted that, whilst adherence to
guidelines was generally fairly good, there were significant variations in practice across the
country, particularly with respect to the administrative prevalence that ranged between 0.2-
1.0%.79 The second review noted improvements in service developments and recommended
further work particularly around recognition, capacity building, outcome measurement,
partnership with other agencies and transition services into adulthood.80 Many published
guidelines lack the detail and organisational structure required to make them readily
implementable in day-to-day practice. In an attempt to address this, the European ADHD
guidelines have been operationalised into a format that describes the steps required at each
stage of the process.115,116
 13
Data from the MTA study suggested that, for children with combined type ADHD, a well-
organised medication package of care resulted in enhanced clinical outcomes at 14 months
compared to a comprehensive package of behavioural treatment or community care and that
the combination of the medication and behavioural treatments was similar in most respect to
medication alone.117 Longer term naturalistic follow-up of these children highlighted continued
effects for all groups but that the additional benefits seen in the medication groups were not
sustained over time.118 Whilst some authorities have argued that these findings suggest that
medications do not work in the long term, an alternative explanation is that the added effect of
more intensive medication management diminishes once the intensive control of treatment is
relaxed.119 Supporting this notion, Coghill and Seth have demonstrated continued benefits up
to ten years after titration using a carefully crafted clinical care pathway that aimed to optimise
symptom control within a routine clinical setting.120 Unfortunately, such strong outcomes are
not typical of the literature.121 Recent work assessing UK clinicians' attitudes towards
implementing medication management strategies in routine practice suggests that although key
recommendations from guidelines are seen as important and feasible to implement, others
present considerable implementation challenges in practice.122 Collectively, these findings
suggest that there needs to be greater use of implementation science approaches to ensure that
clinicians work towards implementing evidence-based protocols and that these efforts achieve
the desired clinical outcomes.
Consideration of specific age-groups
Pre-schoolers with ADHD
Although initially considered a disorder of childhood there is now convincing evidence and
wider acceptance that ADHD is a lifespan disorder with early onset and is associated with
considerable burden and costs.123 Chorozoglou et al highlighted the long-term costs associated
with pre-school ADHD; higher costs were consistently predicted by male gender and, for some
cost codes, conduct problems.91 Identification of ADHD during the pre-school years is often
complicated by the fact that ADHD symptoms are typical behaviours that are developmentally
inappropriate for the child’s age.124 Maniadaki et al explored parents’ understanding of child
behaviour problems and their likelihood of help-seeking.125 Parents whose pre-school child
displayed very high levels of ADHD behaviours tended to perceive these as normal
 14
developmental behaviours and were not planning on seeking professional help. This study
highlights the challenges of identifying young children at risk of ADHD and encouraging and
ensuring early access to care.85
From a treatment perspective, research evidence shows that pre-school pharmacological
treatment for ADHD is associated with lower efficacy and higher levels of side effects than for
school-aged children126 and longer-term follow-up studies suggest high levels of medication
discontinuation (25%) in pre-school children.127 Although many parents have a preference for
individual-based treatment,128 guidelines for pre-school ADHD recommend group-based
behavioural interventions based on social learning theory for ADHD.1
Within a systematic review examining the efficacy of behavioural interventions for children
with ADHD,108 results of meta-regression indicated larger effect sizes in trials involving
younger children for outcomes related to positive parenting, ADHD symptoms and conduct
problems, (as reported by the most proximal informant). In addition, a sensitivity analysis
exploring trials with no or low medication use (nearly all involved pre-school children) showed
higher effect sizes. However, when considering the role of behavioural interventions for
ADHD, clinicians should be aware that very little is known about the impact of mediators and
moderators on treatment outcomes. Few treatment moderators have been identified although
parental ADHD strongly influences treatment outcomes, with parents with higher ADHD
symptoms having children with poorer outcomes.129 In addition, a study with mothers and
children with ADHD found that treatment of parental ADHD did not influence the outcome of
behavioural parent training on child ADHD symptomatology.130 Therefore, given the lack of
evidence to help clinicians identify for whom behavioural interventions might be most
effective, it would seem prudent to continue to offer these to all parents of pre-school children
with ADHD.
Transitions between child and adult services
Regardless of the precise service organisation, which varies between countries, optimum
transition from child to adult services involves planning, information transfer and joint working
between teams and should lead to continuity of care during and following the transfer of clinical
responsibility.131Successful transition requires resources as well as the acquisition of additional
skills and knowledge to enable the receiving team to provide continuity of care that meets the
 15
young person’s needs, but has been relatively neglected in relation to ADHD.132 In the UK,
NICE guidelines recommend that, for young people with ADHD who require treatment
transition to adult mental health services, ongoing review of pharmacological treatment should
be shared between specialist mental health and primary health care services.1 However, many
adult mental health practitioners lack experience and training in the management of ADHD,
and may have negative and sceptical attitudes towards it as a condition that warrants
intervention.133-135 Similarly, few practitioners in primary/ambulatory care have direct
experience of child and adolescent psychiatry and may be unfamiliar with the management of
ADHD without support from specialist services.136
The transition from child to adult mental health services poses particular challenges due to
differences in training, thresholds and focus between child and adult mental health services,
leaving a proportion of young people without a clear pathway. Young people often face
multiple other transitions around the time that children’s healthcare services withdraw, and
given the nature of ADHD, some young adults with the condition struggle to organise
themselves to attend appointments and continue treatment. Choices about education,
occupation and residence during the teenage years can have profound impacts on subsequent
life chances. Poor transition may result in young people with ongoing needs disengaging from
services and consequently having worse outcomes.137,138 Studies from European case registers
suggest that the discontinuation of pharmacological treatment for ADHD among young men is
associated
with
an
increased
risk
of
serious
road
traffic
accidents
and
criminal
convictions;112,139 and with increased accidents, injuries and emergency department attendance
among children and young people.140
Two multi-methods studies of transition of mental health care have demonstrated that transition
is often poorly planned, lacks co-ordination and frequently results in discontinuity of care,
particularly for children with neurodevelopmental disorders.131,141 However, insufficient
numbers of young people with neurodevelopmental disorders meant that neither study could
explore transition for young people with ADHD in depth. The limited literature on transition
in ADHD suggests that policy recommendations are not often translated into practice.142,143
Findings from the CPRD in the UK have shown a 95% drop in ADHD drug prescriptions for
young people between the age of 15 and 21 years, with the reduction being most marked
between the ages of 16 and 17.41 This fall in prescribing is far greater than the expected age-
related decrease in symptoms and suggests the possibility of premature discontinuation of
 16
medication among some young people.144 While the management of ADHD is relatively
common within children’s services, clinicians describe high levels of attrition in attendance at
school-leaving age, so that relatively few young people with ongoing service needs are referred
onto adult services. Two of the review authors are currently involved in a multi-method study
that is gathering prospective data from across the British Isles on the number of young adults
who require transition, mapping the available services for young adults with ADHD and
exploring the experience of transition with young people who have ADHD, their parents and
the practitioners who work with them (http://medicine.exeter.ac.uk/catchus/).
Summary
In this article focusing on children and adolescents with ADHD, we have reviewed and
highlighted key findings from the international literature relating to the community and
administrative prevalence of ADHD with an exploration of possible reasons for discrepancies
between these two sets of figures, barriers and facilitators to care and the cost burden of ADHD.
We have also discussed a range of aspects that influence the development and implementation
of evidence-based care pathways for ADHD, with consideration of specific issues relating to
pre-schoolers and older teenagers who require transition into adult services.

Aim: To ascertain the published administrative prevalence of ADHD
 Search Strategy and Selection Criteria
Community prevalence: To identify published systematic reviews describing the community
prevalence of ADHD, a series of searches were conducted using the following databases (from
the date of inception to 22nd June 2016): Medline; Embase; PsycINFO; CINAHL and ASSIA
using (terms describing systematic reviews) and (terms describing ADHD) and (terms
describing prevalence). The full search strategies used in each database are described in the
Appendix (See Appendix Tables 1-5). After duplicate records were removed, 511 titles
remained. The titles and abstracts were reviewed to identify systematic reviews summarising
the prevalence of ADHD. Twenty-nine full papers were obtained from which seven review
papers (published between 2007 and 2015) reported on the prevalence of ADHD in the
community.
Administrative (clinically recorded) prevalence: We conducted a separate search (from the date
of inception to 22nd June 2016) in Medline; Embase; PsycINFO; CINAHL; and ASSIA using
a search strategy reflecting: (terms describing diagnosis or prescribing) and (terms describing
ADHD) and (terms describing prevalence). The full search strategy used in Medline is
described in the Appendix - Table 6. To address the possibility that restricting papers with
terms describing diagnosis or prescribing might be too specific, a further hand search was
performed in Medline from 1996 to 2016 using a search strategy reflecting: (terms describing
ADHD) for the following three journals: ‘Journal of Attention Disorders’; ‘Journal of the
American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry’ and ‘Morbidity and Mortality Weekly
Report’ (MMWR). After duplicate records were removed, 2897 titles and abstracts were
reviewed, 126 full papers were obtained and 55 studies reporting on the administrative
prevalence of ADHD were identified: 25 studies from the US, 7 from the UK and 23 conducted
outside the US and UK.
