IMPORTANCE Psoriasis is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases.
Subclinical atherosclerosis in patients with psoriasis has not been compared with other
conditions associated with increased cardiovascular risk and more rigorous cardiovascular
disease screening, such as type 2 diabetes.
OBJECTIVE To assess the burden of asymptomatic coronary atherosclerosis measured by
coronary artery calcium score in patients with moderate to severe psoriasis compared with
patients with type 2 diabetes and healthy controls.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Three single-center, cross-sectional studies were
performed in patients recruited from specialty outpatient clinics with moderate to severe
psoriasis without type 2 diabetes (recruited from November 1, 2013, through April 31, 2015),
patients with type 2 diabetes without psoriasis or other inflammatory diseases (recruited
from July 1, 2009, through June 20, 2011), and age- and sex-matched healthy controls
without psoriasis, type 2 diabetes, or other inflammatory diseases (recruited from July 1,
2009, through June 20, 2011).
EXPOSURES Psoriasis, type 2 diabetes, and healthy control effect on coronary artery calcium
score.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Coronary artery calcium measured by Agatston score.
RESULTS A total of 387 individuals participated in the study. Mean (SD) age was 51 (7.7), 52
(8.0), and 52 (8.0) years in the psoriasis, type 2 diabetes, and healthy control cohorts,
respectively. There were 64 men (49.6%) in each group, and most patients were white (119
[92.2%], 123 [95.3%], and 128 [99.2%] in the psoriasis, type 2 diabetes, and healthy control
cohorts, respectively). Patients with psoriasis had low cardiovascular risk measured by the
Framingham Risk Score but had a high prevalence of cardiovascular and cardiometabolic risk
factors, similar to patients with type 2 diabetes. In a fully adjusted model, psoriasis was
associated with coronary artery calcium (Tobit regression ratio, 0.89; P < .001) similar to the
association in type 2 diabetes (Tobit regression ratio, 0.79; P = .04). Likelihood ratio testing
revealed incremental value for psoriasis in a fully adjusted model (χ2 = 4.48, P = .03) in
predicting coronary artery calcium. Psoriasis was independently associated with the presence
of any coronary artery calcium (odds ratio, 2.35; 95% CI, 1.12-4.94) in fully adjusted models,
whereas the association of coronary artery calcium with type 2 diabetes was no longer
significant after adding body mass index to the model (odds ratio, 2.18; 95% CI, 0.75-6.35).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Patients with psoriasis have increased coronary artery
calcium by mean total Agatston scores, similar to that of patients with type 2 diabetes,
suggesting that patients with psoriasis harbor high rates of subclinical atherosclerosis beyond
adjustment for body mass index. Major educational efforts for patients and physicians should
be undertaken to reduce the burden of cardiovascular disease in patients with psoriasis.

P
soriasis is an immune-mediated genetic disease associ-
ated with systemic inflammation that affects approxi-
mately 2% of North American and European pop-
ulations. Prevalence varies based on racial and geographic
differences.1 Approximately 20% to 25% of patients have mod-
erate to severe disease, requiring systemic therapy.2 Up to one-
third of patients with psoriasis develop psoriatifc arthritis. Pso-
riasis is strongly linked with several behavioral and medical
comorbidities, including the metabolic syndrome3 and cardio-
vascular disease.4
Psoriasis appears to be an independent risk factor for coro-
naryarterydisease,myocardialinfarction,cerebrovasculardis-
ease, stroke, peripheral vascular disease, and cardiovascular
mortality.5-8 Patients with psoriasis have an excess risk of car-
diovascular mortality, which is the leading cause of mortality
in this group, a 4- to 5-year younger mean age at death com-
pared with those without psoriasis,9 and an increased major
adversecardiovasculareventsrisk,particularlythosewhohave
severe psoriatic disease or have not been prescribed disease-
modifying antirheumatic drugs.10 Furthermore, the pres-
ence of severe psoriasis confers an additional 6.2% absolute
excessriskof10-yearmajoradversecardiovascularevents,even
after adjusting for age, sex, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, to-
bacco use, and hyperlipidemia.11 Framingham Risk Scores
(FRSs) underestimated cardiovascular risk in 73% of low-risk
and 53% of high-risk patients with psoriasis, who were reclas-
sifiedtohigher-riskcategories.12Despitethesesubstantialdata,
patients with psoriasis are not actively educated, counseled,
or screened for cardiovascular disease because data have been
limited by the retrospective nature of population-based
studies5-10,13 and the limited power of prospective studies14,15
using novel imaging methods.
Surrogate outcome measures quantifying cardiovascular
risk are important. Coronary artery calcium (CAC) assess-
menthasbecomewidelyacceptedasatruemeasureofthetotal
burden of atherosclerosis and the cornerstone for screening
the risk of future cardiac events and improving cardiovascu-
lar risk stratification beyond traditional risk factors, espe-
cially in higher-risk groups.16,17 Three studies18-20 found an as-
sociation between moderate to severe psoriasis and increased
CAC,yetcardiovascularriskstratificationforpatientswithpso-
riasis remains the same as the general population despite in-
creasing evidence to support this important excess in cardio-
vascular risk.
Type 2 diabetes mellitus provides an important model of
anestablished,high-riskdiseaseassociatedwithincreasedcar-
diovascular risk for comparison. Patients with psoriasis have
atherogenic lipoprotein21 and adipokine22 profiles similar to
those in patients with type 2 diabetes. Furthermore, CAC as-
sessment is superior to traditional cardiovascular risk factors
for predicting silent myocardial ischemia and short-term
outcomes,23myocardialinfarctionandcardiacdeath,24andcar-
diovascular events (including stroke)25 in asymptomatic type
2 diabetes. As a result, the American College of Cardiology/
American Heart Association guidelines now recommend com-
puted tomography for CAC assessment to improve cardiovas-
cular risk stratification in asymptomatic patients 40 years or
older with type 2 diabetes.26 The objective of this study was
to compare CAC scores in patients with psoriasis with CAC
scores in patients with type 2 diabetes based on the assump-
tion that comparable increases in CAC scores would support
the need for heightened awareness and appropriate screen-
ing for cardiovascular disease in patients with psoriasis.
Methods
Our study population was composed of unrelated individu-
als recruited from a specialty psoriasis clinic at the Baylor Uni-
versity Medical Center (BUMC), the Penn Diabetes Heart Study
(PDHS),27 and the Philadelphia Area Metabolic Syndrome Net-
work (PAMSyN).21 The cohorts represent patients with mod-
erate to severe psoriasis without type 2 diabetes (BUMC), type
2 diabetes without psoriasis or other inflammatory diseases
(PDHS), and age- and sex-matched healthy controls without
psoriasis, type 2 diabetes, or other inflammatory diseases
(PAMSyN). Patients in all cohorts had no history of coronary
heart disease. Patients with psoriasis were consecutively
screened for potential study inclusion from November 1, 2013,
through April 31, 2015. Patients with type 2 diabetes without
psoriasis or other inflammatory diseases were recruited
from July 1, 2009, through June 20, 2011, and age- and sex-
matched healthy controls without psoriasis, type 2 diabetes,
or other inflammatory diseases were recruited from July 1,
2009, through June 20, 2011. Treated and untreated patients
with psoriasis were included and required a diagnosis of mod-
erate to severe psoriasis defined as having 1 of the following 4
criteria: (1) body surface area involvement greater than 10%,
(2) Psoriasis Area and Severity Index score greater than 10, (3)
Dermatology Life Quality Index score greater than 10, or (4)
treatment with oral systemic and/or biological therapy for at
least 6 months. Patients with a history of cardiovascular dis-
ease or symptoms, type 2 diabetes (defined as self-reported
history, current use of medications, or fasting blood glucose

Key Points
Question How does the burden of asymptomatic coronary
atherosclerosis measured by coronary artery calcium score in
patients with moderate to severe psoriasis compare with patients
with type 2 diabetes and healthy controls?
Findings In this analysis of data from 3 cross-sectional studies, the
prevalence of moderate to severe coronary calcification was
similar between patients with psoriasis and those with type 2
diabetes and approximately 5 times greater than healthy controls.
Coronary calcium in patients with moderate to severe psoriasis
was similarly associated with known cardiovascular and
cardiometabolic risk factors when compared with patients with
type 2 diabetes, and the presence of moderate to severe psoriasis
was a significantly stronger predictor of coronary calcification than
type 2 diabetes, independent of the effect of known
cardiovascular and cardiometabolic risk factors.
Meaning These findings support screening for cardiovascular risk
factors systematically in patients with moderate to severe
psoriasis and type 2 diabetes.

by 0.0555]), comorbid inflammatory disease (excluding pso-
riatic arthritis), or current or prior malignant tumor (exclud-
ing nonmelanoma skin cancers) were excluded. Both the PDHS
and PAMSyN excluded patients with prior myocardial infarc-
tion, coronary revascularization, angiographic disease, a posi-
tive stress test result, creatinine level greater than 1.2 mg/dL
(to convert to micromoles per liter, multiply by 88.4), and, in
PAMSyN only, the presence of type 2 diabetes. The institu-
tionalreviewboardsfromBaylorUniversityMedicalCenterand
the University of Pennsylvania approved all 3 studies. All
patients provided written informed consent before participa-
tion, and data were deidentified.
Evaluated Parameters
Metabolic syndrome was defined as the presence of more than
2 of the following: waist circumference greater than 102 cm
(male) or greater than 89 cm (female), triglyceride level of 150
mg/dL or higher (to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply
by 0.0113), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) level
less than 40 (male) or less than 50 (female) mg/dL (to convert
to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.0259), fasting blood glu-
cose level of 100 mg/dL or higher, or blood pressure greater
than 130/85 mm Hg or treated hypertension.28 The FRS was
calculatedusingtotalcholesterolvalues.29TheCACscoreswere
expressed as mean total Agatston score and percentile scores
for all 3 cohorts.30 More detailed methods can be found in the
eMethods in the Supplement.
The 3 cohorts (BUMC, PDHS, and PAMSyN) were age and
sex matched. Summaries of continuous variables are re-
ported as mean (SD) for normally distributed data and as me-
dian(interquartilerange)fornonnormallydistributeddataand
categorical variables as proportions and percentages. Simple
unpaired, 2-tailed t tests (for parametric data) and Mann-
Whitneytests(fornonparametricdata)wereperformedforcon-
tinuous variables and χ2 tests for categorical variables, respec-
tively. Univariate analysis of CAC, assessed by mean total
Agatston scores, was performed using Tobit censored regres-
sion of natural log (CAC + 1) because of the markedly skewed
distribution of CAC in all 3 cohorts.31 Crude associations be-
tween CAC and study variables were also explored using a
Spearman correlation analysis (eTable 1 in the Supplement).
Multivariable Tobit hierarchical regression analysis was per-
formed to understand the association between the presence
of disease (psoriasis or type 2 diabetes) and CAC after adjust-
ing for groups of confounding variables. Model 1 adjusted for
age and sex, model 2 additionally adjusted for established car-
diovascular risk factors (low-density lipoprotein cholesterol
[LDL-C] level, HDL-C level, triglyceride level, systolic blood
pressure, fasting blood glucose level, and current tobacco use),
model 3 additionally adjusted for cardiometabolic risk fac-
tors (body mass index [BMI] and metabolic syndrome), and
model 4 additionally adjusted for medication effects on coro-
nary calcium levels (aspirin, angiotensin-converting enzyme
inhibitors, and statins). Likelihood ratio testing was per-
formed to assess the incremental effect of disease state (pso-
riasis and type 2 diabetes) to each model, and χ2 and P values
for each model were reported. A logistic adjusted regression
analysis was also performed to account for the high percent-
age of CAC scores of 0 in all groups. The CAC data were con-
verted into categorical data (1 indicating any calcium and 0 in-
dicating no calcium) to understand the effect of the disease
(psoriasis or type 2 diabetes) on the presence of any calcium
in the coronary arteries (CAC score >0), which were reported
as odds ratios (ORs) with 95% CIs. All analyses were per-
formed using STATA statistical software, version 12.0 (Stata-
Corp), and P ≤ .05 was set as the threshold of statistical sig-
nificance.
Our sample had more than 90% power to detect an OR of
2.3 to 2.5 using the group of individuals free of psoriasis as ref-
erence, with a frequency of nonzero CAC scores of 0.45 in
patients with psoriasis and 0.3 in individuals without psoria-
sis. Considerations of nonzero CAC score frequencies were
based on previous studies.18,19
Results
Characteristics of Study Groups
Table 1 summarizes patients’demographic and clinical char-
acteristics. A total of 387 individuals participated in the
study. Mean (SD) age was 51 (7.7), 52 (8.0), and 52 (8.0) years
in the psoriasis, type 2 diabetes, and healthy control cohorts,
respectively. There were 64 men (49.6%) in each group, and
most patients were white (119 [92.2%], 123 [95.3%], and 128
[99.2%] in the psoriasis, type 2 diabetes, and healthy control
cohorts, respectively). A significantly high prevalence of car-
diovascular and cardiometabolic risk factors was noted in the
psoriasis and type 2 diabetes cohorts, with the type 2 diabe-
tes cohort having the highest prevalence of hypertension (49
[38.0%] in the psoriasis cohort vs 71 [55.0%] in the type 2 dia-
betes cohort, P = .006) and waist circumference (99.75 [16.8]
cm in the psoriasis cohort vs 108.0 [15.8] cm in the type 2 dia-
betes cohort, P = .001). Dyslipidemia was most prevalent in
the psoriasis cohort (107 [82.9%] in the psoriasis cohort vs 81
[62.8%] in the type 2 diabetes cohort, P < .001). However, the
type 2 diabetes group had significantly higher triglyceride
levels (median, 100 mg/dL [interquartile range, 77-138
mg/dL] for the psoriasis cohort vs 132 mg/dL [interquartile
range, 92-174 mg/dL] for the type 2 diabetes cohort; P = .002)
and lower HDL-C levels (57.7 [19.2] mg/dL for the psoriasis
cohort vs 47.1 [11.4] mg/dL for the type 2 diabetes cohort,
P < .001). The control group had greater total cholesterol
(175.6 [37.2] mg/dL in the type 2 diabetes cohort vs 204.6
[36.6] in the control cohort, P < .001) and LDL-C levels (99.1
[28.7] mg/dL in the type 2 diabetes cohort vs 122.5 [32.2]
mg/dL in the control cohort, P < .001). The psoriasis and type
2 diabetes cohorts had a similar distribution of CAC in higher
tertiles (CAC score >100 and CAC score >400, respectively)
compared with the healthy control cohort.
Characteristics of the Psoriasis Cohort
Table 2 summarizes the psoriasis cohort characteristics strati-
fied by the presence of coronary calcium (CAC score of 0 and
CAC score >0). Patients with psoriasis (n = 129) had median
disease duration of 11 years. The mean age of psoriasis onset
was 27.8 years, with a later onset in patients with CAC scores

greater than 0 (25 vs 31 years, P = .02). A total of 120 patients
(93.0%) had plaque-type psoriasis, and a significantly higher
percentage of patients with plaque-type psoriasis had no evi-
dence of CAC (74 [98.7%] vs 46 [85.2%] in the CAC score of 0
vs CAC score >1 groups, P = .003). A total of 66 patients
(51.2%) had nail involvement, and 26 (20.2%) had nonpustu-
lar involvement of their palms and/or soles. A total of 96
patients (74.4%) were undergoing systemic therapy for a
median of 3 years, with 96 patients (74.4%) receiving bio-
logical therapy. Psoriasis disease activity was generally well
controlled (median Psoriasis Area and Severity Index score,
1.2; median body surface area, 4%), with 100 patients (77.5%)
either clear (score of 0) or having minimal (score of 1) disease
based on the Physician Global Assessment. Forty-four
patients (34.1%) had concomitant psoriatic arthritis. No sig-
nificant differences were observed in clinical severity scores
or treatment status between the 2 groups.
Association of Psoriasis and Traditional
Cardiovascular Risk Factors With CAC
We performed a stratified analysis based on prevalence of tra-
ditional cardiovascular risk factors in patients with psoriasis

Increases in CAC scores were seen with increasing prevalence of traditional
cardiovascular risk factors (RFs) in patients with psoriasis and patients with type
2 diabetes. Traditional cardiovascular RFs are defined as age older than 55 years,
hypertension (defined as systolic blood pressure >140 mm Hg, diastolic blood
pressure >90 mm Hg, or normal blood pressure taking antihypertensive
medications), hyperlipidemia (defined as high-density lipoprotein cholesterol
level <40 mg/dL, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level >160 mg/dL [to

Association of CAC in Psoriasis With Cardiovascular and
Cardiometabolic Risk Factors
In unadjusted Tobit regression analysis of CAC compared with
variables of interest, all 3 groups had significant correlations
between CAC and age, male sex, and FRS 10-year risk, as would
be expected (Table 3). The CAC in the psoriasis cohort re-
vealed stronger correlations with cardiovascular and cardio-
metabolic risk factors, including hypertension (Tobit regres-
sion ratio [TRR], 1.73, 95% CI, 0.96-2.51; P < .001), metabolic
syndrome (TRR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.20-1.83; P = .02), waist cir-
cumference (TRR, 4.74; 95% CI, 2.15-6.93; P < .001), systolic
(TRR,4.72,95%CI,1.76-7.69;P = .002)anddiastolic(TRR,3.66;
95% CI, 0.88-6.42; P = .01) blood pressures, FRS 10-year risk
(TRR, 1.78; 95% CI, 1.00-2.55; P < .001), HDL-C level (TRR,
−2.52; 95% CI, −3.81 to −1.22; P < .001), and blood glucose level
(TRR,4.96;95%CI,1.14-8.78;P = .01)whencomparedwiththe
age- and sex- matched type 2 diabetes group. In the type 2 dia-
betes cohort, CAC scores more strongly correlated with cur-
rent smoking (TRR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.01-2.04; P = .04), regular
exercise (TRR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.01-1.45; P = .04), triglycerides
level (TRR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.18-1.67; P = .02), and very low-
density lipoprotein cholesterol level (TRR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.05-
1.34;P = .03).Spearmancorrelationanalysisalsorevealedsimi-

Association of Psoriasis With CAC in Models
Adjusted for Cardiometabolic Risk Factors
Hierarchical Tobit regression analysis (Table 4) was per-
formed to define the association between the presence of dis-
ease (psoriasis or type 2 diabetes) and CAC after adjusting for
groups of confounding variables. In unadjusted analysis, type
2 diabetes (TRR, 1.12; 95% CI, 0.57-1.67; P < .001) had a stron-
ger association with CAC than psoriasis (TRR, 0.73; 95% CI,
0.18-1.29;P = .01).However,inthefinalmodel,whichwasfully
adjustedforage,sex,cardiovascularriskfactors(LDL-C,HDL-C,
triglycerides, and fasting blood glucose levels, systolic blood
pressure, and tobacco use), cardiometabolic risk factors (BMI
and metabolic syndrome), and medication use (aspirin, an-
giotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and statins), psoria-
sis was associated with CAC (TRR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.35-1.44;
P = .001)similartotheassociationintype2diabetes(TRR,0.79;
95% CI, 0.02-1.55; P = .04).
Logistic multivariable regression models (Table 5) were
constructed using the same models as in the Tobit regression
analysis, with CAC score greater than 0 as the outcome. Pso-
riasis was associated with the presence of any CAC after
adjusting for age, sex, and cardiovascular risk factors, meta-
bolic risk factors, and medication use (OR, 2.35; 95% CI, 1.12-
4.94),whichattenuatedwhenBMIwasaddedtothemodel(OR,
2.18; 95% CI, 0.75-6.35) in type 2 diabetes. Furthermore, when
we added use of systemic or biological therapy to the models,
the TRR and OR increased; however, these analyses were
exploratory.

trols: (1) cardiovascular risk factor profiles were similar in pa-
tients with psoriasis and type 2 diabetes when compared with
age- and sex-matched controls; (2) the prevalence of moder-
ate to severe coronary calcification (CAC mean total Agatston
score >100 and >400) was similar between patients with pso-
riasis and type 2 diabetes and approximately 5 times greater
than controls; (3) coronary calcium in patients with moder-
ate to severe psoriasis demonstrated a similar association with
known cardiovascular and cardiometabolic risk factors when
compared with type 2 diabetes; and (4) the presence of CAC
in patients with psoriasis persisted independent of BMI, which
was not observed in patients with type 2 diabetes.
Psoriasis and type 2 diabetes share common pathoge-
netic mechanisms with the important potential for inflamma-
tory atherogenesis. Both are chronic inflammatory disorders
that result from a complex interplay between genetic and
environmental influences. They both demonstrate a predomi-
nantly proinflammatory milieu composed of tumor necrosis
factor, interferon γ, interleukin (IL) 6, and IL-17 caused by im-
balances in proinflammatory (helper T cell [TH1] and TH17) and
anti-inflammatory (T-regulatory and TH2) T-cell subsets and
increased expression of proinflammatory signature genes, re-
sulting in a chronic inflammatory state.32,33 This inflamma-
tion contributes to endothelial dysfunction and monocyte or
macrophage recruitment, seminal events in atherogenesis.34
Elevated markers of oxidative stress and platelet-derived mi-
croparticles have been reported in the serum of patients with
psoriasis35 and type 2 diabetes,36 which can lead to increased
endothelial activation.34 Several epidemiologic studies37-39
have described the high incidence of cardiovascular risk fac-
tors, such as smoking, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and cen-
tral obesity, in both of these groups. Obesity and the associ-
ated metabolic syndrome are especially important because
adipose tissue is a major source of tumor necrosis factor, IL-1,
IL-6, IL-8, and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1. Adipose
tissues also secrete adipokines, including leptin and resistin,
which can independently lead to insulin resistance and in-
creased risk of atherogenesis.34
An increased incidence of thrombo-occlusive disease was
first noted in patients with psoriasis in the late 1970s.40 Most
of the data, which have driven the discussion linking psoria-
sis with cardiovascular disease, prognostic indicators, and pa-
tient management strategies, have been accrued during the
past decade.41 Multiple oral systemic and biological treat-
ment strategies have produced decreased vascular inflamma-
tion with appropriate patient management in psoriasis and
other immune-mediated inflammatory diseases. In recent
years, various noninvasive imaging and functional markers
have been studied to better understand the risk for athero-
sclerosis in psoriasis.14,42,43 Multidetector computed tomog-
raphy–derived CAC has long been recognized as a reliable sur-
rogate marker of subclinical atherosclerosis and has immense
prognostic value, especially in asymptomatic adults at inter-
mediate cardiovascular risk.44 Coronary artery calcium has
high sensitivity, albeit only moderate specificity, for obstruc-
tive CAD. In addition, calcification is a measure of stabilized

plaque but may not always account for the noncalcified plaque
burden (ie, the type that is vulnerable for rupture). Nonethe-
less, studies have found that CAC can reliably predict future
adverse cardiovascular events, correlates well with cardiac
computed tomography angiography findings of significant an-
giographic stenosis,45 is cost-effective,46 and provides an ad-
ditivebenefittoexistingcardiovascularriskassessmenttools.47
The beneficial role of CAC in cardiovascular risk assess-
ment of type 2 diabetes has been well established.25 How-
ever, CAC assessment in psoriasis has only been performed in
a small number of case-control studies18-20,48,49 (eTable 2 in
the Supplement). Similar to our results, most of these studies
reportanincreasedCACburdeninpatientswithpsoriasiswhen
compared with controls. Although a previous study50 found
a lower risk for cardiovascular events in patients with psoria-
sis treated with anti–tumor necrosis factor therapy, no study
to date has investigated the longitudinal effect of systemic
therapy on CAC. In the present study, we found that adjust-
ment for any systemic and biological therapy in multivari-
able model increased the regression ratio and OR by approxi-
mately 50%, thereby suggesting that these treatments may in
fact have an association with lower CAC in patients with pso-
riasis. Ongoing studies51-53 in psoriasis are investigating the ef-
fect of intensive skin disease treatment on cardiovascular dis-
ease (clinicaltrials.gov, NCT01553058, NCT02187172, and
NCT01866592). These studies will elucidate the effect of bio-
logical treatment on subclinical vascular diseases.
In a landmark study, Gelfand et al5 found a significantly
high incidence of myocardial infarction in patients with pso-
riasis from a UK-based registry of more than 500 000 pa-
tients. To our knowledge, our study is the first to investigate
the prevalence of CAC in a large cohort of patients with pso-
riasis when compared with a matched type 2 diabetes cohort,
a well-established coronary disease risk equivalent. We were
also able to demonstrate a strong association between sub-
clinical atherosclerosis and prevalence of cardiovascular and
cardiometabolic risk factors in psoriasis. Our findings are cer-
tainly intriguing given the fact that our patients were rela-
tively young, with most having their moderate to severe cu-
taneous disease under good therapeutic control. However, the
relative presence of moderate to severe psoriasis revealed
greater strength in CAC assessment than type 2 diabetes, in-
dependent of the effect of known cardiovascular and cardio-
metabolic risk factors. The attenuation of the association be-
tween type 2 diabetes and CAC when adjusted for BMI was not
observed in psoriasis, suggesting that CAC may be mediated,
in part, by adiposity in type 2 diabetes.
We acknowledge certain limitations relating to our study
design. The cross-sectional study design and lack of biologi-
cal data limit our ability to establish a cause-effect relation-
ship between psoriasis and atherosclerosis. Variations among
differentethnicgroupscouldnotbeestablishedgiventhatmost
of our study patients were white, which is the major demo-
graphic group affected with psoriasis in North America and Eu-
rope. Of note, almost all patients with psoriasis controlled their
disease well with systemic or biological therapy for approxi-
mately 3 years before recruitment. This level of disease con-
trol likely underestimates the burden of subclinical athero-
sclerosis in our cohort. In addition, high-sensitivity C-reactive
proteinvalueswerenotobtainedforourcohortofpatientswith
psoriasis. As such, we were unable to adjust for this variable
as a crude marker of inflammation in our models. Further-
more, a previous study by Staniak et al19 found a dose-
response relationship between psoriatic skin severity and se-
vere coronary calcium disease (CAC score >400). However, our
study failed to find this relationship, likely because of the well-
controlled nature of cutaneous disease plus the inclusion of
previously treated patients in our study when compared with
the cohort of patients with psoriasis.
Conclusions
Psoriasis increases CAC scores to the extent of what is ob-
served in type 2 diabetes, independent of the effect of cardio-
vascular and cardiometabolic risk factors. Psoriasis and type
2diabetessharesimilarcardiovascularriskprofiles,whichmay
predispose patients to developing coronary atherosclerosis at
a relatively young age. These findings warrant early cardio-
vascular risk assessment and aggressive risk factor modifica-
tion in those with moderate to severe psoriasis. In addition,
CAC assessment may be considered in patients with psoriasis
whohave2ormoretraditionalcardiovascularriskfactorsgiven
the high prevalence of CAC observed in this study.

NOTABLE NOTES
The Legacy of Maurice Raynaud
Arpan V. Prabhu, BS; Chester V. Oddis, MD
Bornin1834asthesonofauniversityprofessor,MauriceRaynaudtrained
at the University of Paris and became a French physician in 1862.1 Al-
though he was affiliated with various hospitals and clinics, for political
reasons Raynaud was never able to secure a senior faculty position at
any hospitals in Paris. Nevertheless, he achieved scientific and medical
fame as a medical student with his doctoral thesis titled, “Local As-
phyxia and Symmetrical Gangrene of the Extremities.”Raynaud’
s the-
sis described 25 patients, 20 of whom were female, who had a series of
colorchangesintheirhandsandfeetwhenexposedtothecoldorwhen
the patients were under stress.2 This is known today as Raynaud phe-
nomenon, and it is associated with a wide variety of medical conditions
spanning across multiple medical disciplines.3
Raynaud described the order of changes in the extremities from
blanchingtocyanosistoerythema.3Subsequentinvestigationhasshown
that Raynaud phenomenon is mostly triggered by episodic, symmetric
vasospasmofthedigitalarteriesleadingtotheappearanceofflatnails.2
At the time of his report, Raynaud had not yet recognized that these
symptoms could be warning signs of more severe systemic disease,
prompting new designations of primary and secondary Raynaud
syndromes.1WhenRaynauddiscoveredthesyndrome,treatmentmainly
consistedofcounselingtoavoidcoldweather,stressfulconditions,and
the consumption of anything that would constrict blood vessels. To-
day, in addition to common sense measures in the cold weather, there
are many pharmacologic interventions as well as surgical procedures
available as treatment options.3
Raynaud’
s contributions did not end with his report of this syn-
drome.Ayearafterreceivinghisdoctoraldegree,Raynaudsubmitteda
postdoctoral thesis of 2 notable publications on the history of medi-
cine, the “
Asclepiades of Bithynia, doctor and philosopher”and “Medi-
cine in Molière’
s time.”
1 He was also a prolific writer, and his book Sur la
salive d'un enfant mort de la rage was published after a research col-
laboration with Louis Pasteur and Odilon Marc Lannelongue. In addi-
tion, Raynaud was admired and respected as a superb teacher and lec-
turer throughout the universities and hospitals in Paris. In 1879, he was
elected to the Academy of Medicine.1
Despitehisnumerousachievements,Raynaudwasunabletoachieve
his goal of becoming a chair of medical history in Paris. Cardiac disease
plaguedRaynaudforseveralyears,andhediedin1881fromanacutemyo-
cardial infarction.
