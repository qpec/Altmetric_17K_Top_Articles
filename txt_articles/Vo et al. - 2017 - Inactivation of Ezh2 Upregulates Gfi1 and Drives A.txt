SUMMARY
The most aggressive of four medulloblastoma (MB)
subgroups are cMyc-driven group 3 (G3) tumors,
some of which overexpress EZH2, the histone
H3K27 mono-, di-, and trimethylase of polycomb-
repressive complex 2. Ezh2 has a context-dependent
role in different cancers as an oncogene or tumor sup-
pressor and retards tumor progression in a mouse
model of G3 MB. Engineered deletions of Ezh2 in G3
MBs by gene editing nucleases accelerated tumori-
genesis, whereas Ezh2 re-expression reversed atten-
dant histone modifications and slowed tumor pro-
gression. Candidate oncogenic drivers suppressed
by Ezh2 included Gfi1, a proto-oncogene frequently
activated in human G3 MBs. Gfi1 disruption antago-
nized the tumor-promoting effects of Ezh2 loss;
conversely, Gfi1 overexpression collaborated with
Myc to bypass effects of Trp53 inactivation in driving
MB progression in primary cerebellar neuronal pro-
genitors. Although negative regulation of Gfi1 by
Ezh2 may restrain MB development, Gfi1 activation
can bypass these effects.
INTRODUCTION
The polycomb-repressive complex 2 (PRC2) is composed of
the catalytic histone-lysine methyltransferases, EZH2 or EZH1,
together with EED, SUZ12, and other accessory proteins,
including JARID2 and RbAp46/48 (Margueron and Reinberg,
2011; O’Meara and Simon, 2012). EZH2 mono-, di-, and trime-
thylates lysine 27 of histone 3 (H3K27) to promote transcriptional
silencing. PRC2 plays an important role during tissue develop-
ment in establishing cell identity, and it is deregulated in several
cancers in which it can have context-dependent oncogenic or
tumor-suppressive roles (Comet et al., 2016; Kim and Roberts,
2016; Sauvageau and Sauvageau, 2010). High levels of, and
gain-of-function mutations in, EZH2 are associated with a broad
spectrum of aggressive and advanced cancers for which spe-
cific and potent competitive inhibitors of EZH2 catalytic activity
have revealed pre-clinical and phase I/II clinical activity (Kim
and Roberts, 2016). However, in direct contrast, EZH2 acts as
a tumor suppressor in other cancers in which inactivating loss-
of-function mutations have been identified (Comet et al., 2016;
Kim and Roberts, 2016), underscoring caveats in applying ther-
apeutic EZH2 inhibitors.
Medulloblastoma (MB), the most common malignant brain tu-
mor in children, comprises four molecularly distinct subgroups,
including those dependent on Wingless (WNT) or Sonic Hedge-
hog (SHH) signaling, as well as less well characterized group 3
(G3) and group 4 (G4), each of which responds differently to cur-
rent therapy (Northcott et al., 2012a). MBs sustain few recurrent
mutations when compared to most other cancers. The four MB
subgroups differ in their mutational landscape, gene expression,
pathology, and prognosis, and attempts to stratify therapies are
emerging (Kool et al., 2012; Northcott et al., 2012a; Parsons
et al., 2011; Robinson et al., 2012; Taylor et al., 2012). Although
all patients generally receive combinations of surgery, radia-
tion, and chemotherapy, particularly aggressive G3 tumors are
treated very intensively.
About 25% of human MBs are G3 tumors characterized
by high MYC levels resulting from somatic MYC gene amplifica-
tion in 15%–20% of G3 cases and from unknown causes in the
majority. Some G3 MBs express relatively high levels of EZH2
associated with gains of chromosome 7 and increased global
H3K27me3
chromatin-repressive
marks
(Robinson
et
al.,
2012).
In
contrast,
the
H3K27me3-specific
demethylase,
KDM6A/UTX, is mutated in a mutually exclusive fashion mainly

 in G4 MBs (Dubuc et al., 2012, 2013; Northcott et al., 2012b;
Robinson et al., 2012). A mouse model of G3 MB dependent
upon Myc overexpression in obligatorily Trp53-null granule
neuron progenitors (GNPs) expresses high levels of global
H3K27me3 chromatin marks (Kawauchi et al., 2012; Robinson
et al., 2012), implicating Ezh2 within the PRC2 complex as a
putative oncogenic driver in G3 MBs. We have now used
gene-editing systems to investigate the dependency of G3 MB
on Ezh2 and to explore its functional relationship with other
genes implicated in MB formation.
RESULTS
Deletion of Ezh2 Accelerates De Novo MB Development
and Progression of Established MBs
Exons 15–20 of Ezh2 encode the SET domain required for cata-
lytic activity (Figure 1A). We used all-in-one CRISPR-Cas9 plas-
mids encoding GFP and Cas9, with or without single-guide
RNAs (sgRNAs), to simultaneously target both Ezh2 exons 10
and 18 in primary Trp53�/�;Cdkn2c�/� GNPs grown as neuro-
spheres. DNA sequencing of GFP-positive, CRISPR-targeted
subclones revealed that virtually all of them contained Ezh2
mutations, which included indels in exons 10 and 18 as well as
deletion of intervening sequences (see below).
Pooled GFP-positive neurospheres isolated by fluorescence-
activated cell sorting (FACS) were infected with retroviral vectors
expressing red fluorescent protein (RFP) with or without Myc.
Immunoblotting of proteins extracted from CRISPR-Cas9-edited
populations demonstrated absence of detectable Ezh2 with
decreased global H3K27me3 and increased H3K27 acetylation
(ac) marks but unaltered H3K4me3 levels (Figure 1B). Expression
of Eed was unchanged, whereas the level of Suz12, another
core component of the PRC2 complex, was decreased in
Ezh2-deficient
cells
(Figure
1B).
Myc+;Trp53�/�;Cdkn2c�/�
GNPs, whether expressing Ezh2 or not, formed large-cell
anaplastic MBs (Figure S1A) when injected into the cortices of
nude mice, but Ezh2-deficient tumors arose more rapidly (Fig-
ure 1C), indicating that Ezh2 restrains MB formation. Importantly,
Myc was required for MB formation regardless of Ezh2 status.
We similarly used CRISPR-Cas9 to delete Ezh2 from four indi-
vidually derived Myc-induced primary G3 tumors (propagated as
MB1–MB4 ‘‘tumorsphere’’ lines). Each MB cell line contained
multiple unique Myc retroviral integration sites, arguing against
a requirement for specific insertional mutagenesis on tumor
development and implying that the primary tumors were poly-
clonal (Figure S1B). Using established Myc+ G3 MB lines in lieu
of primary Trp53�/�;Cdkn2c�/� GNPs, we again simultaneously
targeted exons 10 and 18 with CRISPR-Cas9; 94% of single-
cell-derived subclones demonstrated Ezh2 indels and/or dele-
tions of intervening DNA between exons 10 and 18. Pooled
tumorspheres significantly downregulated full-length Ezh2 pro-
tein expression (Figure 1D) with concomitant decreases of global
H3K27me3 (Figures 1D, S1C, and S1D) and increases in
H3K27ac marks compared to those in sham-targeted Ezh2+/+
MBs that received CRISPR-Cas9 but no sgRNAs (Figure 1D).
Equal numbers of cultured primary MB cells, expressing Ezh2
or not, were implanted into the cortices of secondary 6- to
8-week-old recipient mice, where G3 MBs arise equally well
outside the cerebellum and maintain their key genotypic and
phenotypic characteristics (Kawauchi et al., 2012). Ezh2-defi-
cient MB cells induced tumors significantly faster than those
expressing control levels of Ezh2 despite variations in tumor
latencies between different MB lines (Figure 1E).
DNA deep sequencing of sham-targeted primary MB1 and
MB3 tumors confirmed that more than 99.6% of amplified
Ezh2 exon 10 and 18 sequences were wild-type. In contrast,
CRISPR-targeted primary tumorsphere populations contained
numerous clonal variants, each represented at a different fre-
quency, confirming the efficiency of gene editing and tumor
polyclonality (Table S1). The observed genetic variations likely
account for the heritable but variable tumor latencies of the
four independently derived MB lines. After orthotopic transplan-
tation, secondary tumors were harvested from the cortices of
recipient mice and triturated, and purified tumor cells were
analyzed without intervening culture (Kawauchi et al., 2012).
Three randomly selected secondary tumors derived from pri-
mary MB1 and MB3 cells also contained numerous, only partially
overlapping clonal variants, many of which had not been de-
tected in the primary tumor from which they arose and consistent
with continued clonal evolution (Table S1).
Secondary tumors lacked detectable Ezh2 (Figure 1D) and
exhibited global decreases in H3K27me3 but no significant
changes in H3K4me3 at regions within 3 kb upstream and down-
stream of the promoter transcriptional start sites (TSS) (Figures
S1E and S1F). RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and gene set enrich-
ment analysis (GSEA) of pooled Ezh2+ and Ezh2� tumors (three
each from MB1, MB2, and MB3) highlighted significant concor-
dance between genes upregulated in Ezh2-deficient tumors and
those having high CpG density and promoter H3K27me3 marks
in embryonic day 14.5 mouse whole brains or neural precursor
cells (Figures S1G and S1H; Meissner et al., 2008). Among the
most commonly affected genes resulting from Ezh2 inactivation
in MBs were those affecting tissue development and homeobox
(Hox) genes (Figure S1I; see below).
As an independent approach, TALENs targeting a sequence
within Ezh2 exon 14 were used to induce SET domain frameshift
mutations; selected single-cell-derived MB1 subclones were
evaluated one by one for tumor development. Six of 58 clones
completely lacked Ezh2 protein expression. Of these, TALEN-
targeted single-cell clones 5, 23, and 47, each with frameshift
mutations of 5, 2, and 11 base pairs, respectively, in one allele
and a large deletion of the other, as well as control clones
without Ezh2 mutations, were selected for further evaluation of
protein expression (Figure 1F) and tumorigenicity (Figure 1G).
Each of the three Ezh2-null clones generated secondary MBs
faster than control clones expressing Ezh2, although single

 Ezh2+ clones were less aggressive than the polyclonal MB1
tumor from which they were derived (compare with Figure 1E,
top left panel).
Injection of MB1 cells engineered to overexpress an Ezh2
mutant lacking the catalytic SET domain (Ezh2DSET) (Varam-
bally et al., 2002) mimicked the effects of Ezh2 deletion on global
histone marks (Figure 2A) and accelerated secondary tumor for-
mation (Figure 2B). These findings suggested that Ezh2DSET
acts as a dominant-negative mutant that quenches the catalytic
activity of wild-type Ezh2. In contrast, two Ezh2 gain-of-function
mutants (Y637F and Y637S) that increased H3K27me3 levels
(Figure 2C) and contribute to oncogenicity in other tumor types
(Sneeringer et al., 2010) slowed secondary MB1 tumor formation
(Figure 2D). Furthermore, disruption of Suz12, which encodes a
critical component required for assembly of the PRC2 complex
(Pasini et al., 2004), accelerated MB tumorigenicity as well (Fig-
ures 2E, 2F, and S2A–S2C). Finally, when we re-introduced
Ezh2-IRES-GFP versus GFP alone into Ezh2+ or Ezh2� MB1
and MB3 cells (Figure 2G), accelerated tumor formation accom-
panying Ezh2 inactivation was significantly reversed (Figures 2H
and 2I). Retardation of tumor development after Ezh2 restoration
argues that any elicited off-target mutations were not respon-
sible for the consistently observed phenotypic changes following
Ezh2 loss. Taken together, inactivation of Ezh2 and disruption of
PRC2 histone methylase function accelerates G3 MB formation
and tumor progression.
Ezh2 Inactivation in G3 MB Implicates Gfi1 as an
Oncogenic Target Gene
Because H3K27me3 is a repressive promoter mark and deple-
tion of Ezh2 accelerated tumor initiation and progression, we
reasoned that genes driving proliferation would be upregulated
in G3 MBs lacking Ezh2. Three Ezh2-deficient and three control
secondary tumors derived from each of three MB lines (18 total
samples) were subjected to comparative RNA-seq analysis.
Heatmaps of the top 1,000 differentially expressed genes (not
shown) confirmed that all tumors remained more closely related
to the G3 MB subgroup than to mouse MBs of the SHH or WNT
subgroups or to primary GNPs (Kawauchi et al., 2012). The top
nine most significantly upregulated genes in Ezh2-deficient sec-
ondary tumors compared to Ezh2-positive ones included at least
six Hox genes (also see Figure S1I) known to be regulated
by PRC2 (Bracken et al., 2006; Levine et al., 2004; Lund and
van Lohuizen, 2004), as well as Igf2bp2, Gfi1, and Erbb2 (Figures
3A and S3A). HOX protein levels were increased in MB1-MB3
Ezh2-deficient secondary tumor cells (Figure 3B). Gfi1 and
Erbb2 were previously revealed to have oncogenic activity in
MB (Gilbertson, 2005; Northcott et al., 2014), whereas Igf2bp2
has been implicated as an oncogene in other systems (Baxter,
2014; Bell et al., 2013). With the exception of Erbb2, these genes
were downregulated when Ezh2 expression was again rein-
forced (Figures S3B and S3C). Myc (with Cdh1 used as an addi-
tional control) was unaffected. Enforced retroviral vector-medi-
ated overexpression of GFP-tagged Gfi1 and Erbb2, but not
Igf2bp2 or Hoxb4, in MB1 and MB2 tumorspheres accelerated
MB tumor formation after re-transplantation of sorted GFP-pos-
itive cells into the brains of mice (Figures 3C–3E).
To investigate whether these same genes sustained Ezh2-
dependent modifications of histone H3, we performed chromatin
immunoprecipitation followed by nucleotide sequencing (ChIP-
seq) with antibodies to H3K27me3, H3K4me3, and H3K27ac in
secondary MB3 tumors expressing Ezh2 or not (Figure 3F).
Although
inactivation
of
Ezh2
led
to
global
changes
in
H3K27me3 and H3K27ac in Myc+;Trp53�/�;Cdkn2c�/� GNPs
(Figure 1B), in primary MB tumors (Figure 1D), and secondary
tumors derived from them (Figures S1E and S1F), the patterns
of such modifications across specifically targeted genes were
variable. Reciprocal Ezh2-dependent changes in H3K27me3
and H3K27ac were evident across five Hox genes (Figure 3F).
Although no global changes in H3K4me3 were observed in these
tumors (e.g., Figure S1F), H3K4me3 occupancy increased over
all Hox genes studied, consistent with their robust activation in
response to Ezh2 inactivation (Figure 3F). In contrast, although
Erbb2 was upregulated when Ezh2 was deleted, patterns of
histone H3 modifications across this gene were unaffected (Fig-
ure 3F) and Erbb2 expression was not downregulated when
Ezh2 was restored (Figures S3B and S3C). ChIP-seq analysis
of Gfi1 revealed a distinct pattern in which reduction of
H3K27me3 in response to Ezh2 loss predominated (Figure 3F).
Together, these data suggested that several Hox genes and
Gfi1 were direct transcriptionally repressed targets of Ezh2,
whereas Erbb2 might be indirectly regulated in response to
Ezh2 downregulation.
Functional Interactions between Ezh2 and Gfi1
Given that Gfi1, a documented G3 MB oncogenic driver, was up-
regulated in response to Ezh2 inactivation (Figure 2) and was a
presumptive target of Ezh2 regulation (Figures 3A and 3F), we
explored the effects of Gfi1 inactivation on MB tumor progres-
sion. To this end, we co-infected three all-in-one CRISPR-
Cas9 vectors containing guide RNAs directed to Gfi1 exons 4
and 5 and co-expressing GFP to inactivate the zinc finger
DNA-binding domain of Gfi1 in highly aggressive Ezh2-negative
MB3 cells (Figure 4A). Following retrieval of infected GFP-posi-
tive cells by FACS and expansion of the edited cultured tumor-
spheres, deep-sequencing analysis was performed to determine
the frequencies of Gfi1 mutations in the edited populations,
which manifested frequent deletions within exon 4 and indels
affecting exon 5 (Figures S4A–S4C). Simultaneous targeting
of these two exons generated a mixture of cells of which some

 retained Gfi1 expression; immunoblotting confirmed increased
Gfi1 levels in Ezh2� MB3 cells versus Ezh2+ controls and their
partial reduction after CRISPR-Cas9-mediated editing (Fig-
ure 4B). Introduction of these Ezh2� and partially Gfi1-deficient
MB3 cells into the brains of nude CD1 mice demonstrated that
Gfi1 inactivation slowed tumor progression (Figure 4C). When
orthotopically transplanted into naive mice, edited individual
Gfi1� MB1 subclones 1 and 14 (Figure S4D) similarly exhibited
retarded MB tumorigenicity as compared to Gfi1+ control clones
(Figure 4D).
By contrast, when vectors expressing Gfi1-GFP or GFP alone
were used to infect Myc+;Trp53�/�;Cdkn2c�/� MB1 and MB2 tu-
morspheres, Ezh2 expression was unaffected by Gfi1 whereas
Myc levels were modestly increased (Figure 4E). Enforced Gfi1
expression in MB1 tumorspheres increased their proliferation
rate (Figure S4E). RNA-seq analysis of six control (GFP only)
and seven secondary tumors overexpressing Gfi1-GFP whose
onset was accelerated (Figure 4D) showed that more than
2,000 transcripts were differentially regulated more than 2-fold
(false discovery rate [FDR] < 0.05; Figures 4F and 4G). ChIP-
seq analysis revealed that the endogenous Gfi1 protein binds
directly to the Ezh2, Suz12, and Eed promoters in primary non-
tumorigenic neurospheres generated from GNPs purified from
the cerebellum of 7-day-old Trp53�/�;Cdkn2c�/� pups (Fig-
ure S4F). Whereas enforced Gfi1 overexpression had little effect
on expression of these same three PRC2 genes in MB tumor
cells, it negatively regulated expression of PRC2 target genes,
consistent with its known role as a transcriptional repressor
(Duan et al., 2005; Grimes et al., 1996; McGhee et al., 2003; Sale-
que et al., 2007; Vassen et al., 2006; Zweidler-Mckay et al.,
1996). In particular, Hox genes as well as Erbb2 and Igf2bp2 (Fig-
ures 4F and S4G) were downregulated in direct contrast to their
upregulation in response to Ezh2 inactivation (Figures 3 and S3).
Gfi1 can directly repress the homeobox gene Meis1 to regulate
expression of a transcription complex consisting of Meis1,
Hoxa9, and Pbx1 (Chowdhury et al., 2013; Horman et al.,
2009), and in agreement, all three of these genes were signifi-
cantly downregulated in response to Gfi1 transduction (Fig-
ure S4G). Through GSEA analysis, the global gene expression
pattern observed after Gfi1 transduction was consistent with
downregulation of Suz12 target genes (Figure 4G; Pasini et al.,
2004). Hence, not only does inactivation of Ezh2 decrease Gfi1
H3K27me3 modification (Figure 3F) and increase Gfi1 expres-
sion (Figures 2, 4C, and S3C), but Ezh2 and Gfi1 repress a com-
mon set of PRC2 target genes (Figures 4F, 4G, S4G, and S4H).
Yet these two genes play contrasting roles in respectively inhib-
iting and accelerating Myc-induced G3 MB, implying that Gfi1
has additional relevant targets.
Strikingly, although induction of G3 MBs from primary mouse
GNPs depends upon both Myc overexpression and Trp53 loss of
function whether Ezh2 is defective or not, overexpression of both
Myc and Gfi1 was sufficient to induce large-cell anaplastic MBs
in primary GNPs that retained functional Trp53 (Figures 4H and
4I). Similar findings have been made using different neural
stem and progenitor cells isolated from the neonatal cerebellum
(Northcott et al., 2014). Indeed, a subset of human G3 MBs over-
express both MYC and GFI1 but retain wild-type TP53, implying
that GFI1 may act to subvert p53-dependent tumor suppression.
RNA-seq analysis revealed that expression of several hundred
genes was differentially regulated in Myc+ MBs generated
from 18 primary Trp53�/� GNPs versus MBs arising from four
Trp53+/+ GNPs overexpressing Gfi1 (Figure 4J). However, there
were no significant differences in expression of canonical p53-
responsive genes (including Cdkn1a [p21], Cdkn2a [Ink4a/Arf],
Mdm2, or Bcl2 family members) between these cohorts (see
data accession numbers in Experimental Procedures), providing
no mechanistic data directly linking Gfi1 with the p53 pathway. In
summary, Ezh2 and Gfi1 play both common and distinctly
different cross-regulatory roles in MB tumor development, with
Ezh2 loss and Gfi1 overexpression contributing to enhanced
tumorigenesis.
DISCUSSION
Mouse G3 MBs, which can be selectively derived by enforced
expression of Myc (but not MycN) in Trp53-null GNPs, express
high levels of Ezh2 (Kawauchi et al., 2012; Vo et al., 2016), consis-
tent with findings that Myc upregulates Ezh2 transcription in other
biological settings (Koh et al., 2011; Neri et al., 2012; Sander et al.,
2008). Human G3 MBs also frequently express the GFI1 or GFI1B
proto-oncogenes, with their activation depending on the hijack-
ing of either local or distal enhancers that are brought into the
proximity of their promoters (Northcott et al., 2014). Activation
of GFI1 genes in approximately one-third of G3 MBs is among
the most frequent genetic driver alterations in this subgroup, sur-
passing the 17% that exhibit frank MYC amplification. In the
mouse, Myc and Gfi1, but neither alone, can act to produce
typical G3 MBs when introduced into neural stem cells, notably
even when wild-type Trp53 is retained (Northcott et al., 2014).
Myc and Gfi1 also act as synergistic oncogenes in T cell lympho-
magenesis (Schmidt et al., 1998; Zo
¨ rnig et al., 1996), in which
Ezh2 similarly has tumor-suppressive activity (Kim and Roberts,
2016). Taken together, these findings imply that Myc, Ezh2, and
Gfi1 can conspire to induce G3 MBs, although the exact func-
tional relationships between them remain unclear.
EZH2 mutations or somatic copy number alterations have not
been observed in human MBs. However, disruption of Ezh2 in
multiple experimental settings revealed that Ezh2 suppresses
tumorigenesis. Deletion of Ezh2 in Trp53-null GNPs was
dispensable for Myc-dependent MB formation but accelerated

planted to yield secondary tumors. (C) MB1 overexpressing Gfi1 and GFP (red; n = 11) or GFP alone (blue; n = 7; ***p < 0.001); MB2 (red; n = 10; blue n = 5;

 G3 MB development. Similarly, orthotopic transplantation of
Ezh2-deficient and Suz12-deficient mouse G3 MB tumorspheres
yielded secondary G3 tumors more rapidly than their Ezh2+/+
counterparts. As expected, deletion of Ezh2 in mouse GNPs or
MBs decreased global H3K27me3 and increased H3K27ac
chromatin marks, whereas re-introduction of Ezh2 into Ezh2-
deficient MB cells reversed these histone modifications. Subse-
quent secondary MB development was also retarded by Ezh2
reconstitution, implying that Ezh2 impedes tumorigenesis by re-
pressing target genes that convey oncogenic activity.

 Loss of Ezh2 was accompanied by upregulation of many
genes, the top nine of which included six homeobox genes
(Hoxa11, Hoxb4, Hoxb5, Hoxb9, Hoxb13, and Hoxc8) as well
as Igf2bp2, Erbb2, and Gfi1. With exception of Erbb2, retroviral
transduction of Ezh2 into Ezh2-deficient G3 MBs suppressed
these same genes and reversed the patterns of Hox gene and
Gfi1 promoter-proximal H3K27 histone marks. Consistent with
its reported oncogenic potential in unclassified MB subtypes
(Gilbertson et al., 2001), Erbb2 transduction accelerated MB
tumorigenicity. However, Erbb2 expression and promoter-prox-
imal histone modifications were not changed when Ezh2 was
re-expressed in Ezh2-deficient tumor cells, implying that Erbb2
is not a direct target of Ezh2-mediated repression in G3 MBs.
High expression of HOXB4 observed in some human MBs
(Bodey et al., 2000) was not associated with G3 MBs, and
although Hoxb4 activity was suppressed by Ezh2, its enforced
expression did not accelerate G3 MB tumor progression. Neither
did enforced expression of Igf2bp2 hasten MB development,
although it can function as an oncogene in different contexts
(Baxter, 2014; Bell et al., 2013).
By contrast, enforced expression of Gfi1 accelerated second-
ary G3 MB formation, mimicking effects of Ezh2 deficiency,
whereas Gfi1 disruption counteracted the effects of Ezh2 inacti-
vation, together providing at least a partial rationale for Ezh2-
mediated tumor suppression. Gfi1 is a 55-kDa zinc finger tran-
scriptional repressor, with six C2H2 zinc finger domains at the
C terminus that bind DNA; a SNAG motif at the N terminus is
further required for transcriptional repression (Grimes et al.,
1996; Zweidler-Mckay et al., 1996). Gfi1 can bind directly to pro-
moter-proximal sequences at a consensus motif (Duan and Hor-
witz, 2003), where it can recruit histone deacetylases and Ezh2 to
generate repressive H3K27me3 chromatin modifications (Duan
et al., 2005; McGhee et al., 2003; Saleque et al., 2007; Vassen
et al., 2006). Gfi1 can also be recruited to promoters indepen-
dently of its direct DNA-binding activity to enforce gene repres-
sion by Myc/Miz1/Max complexes (Liu et al., 2010), a feature
particularly relevant in G3 MBs, in which Myc/Miz/Max-repres-
sive functions are key determinants of the G3 subtype (Vo
et al., 2016). Importantly, Gfi1 overexpression is sufficient to
induce mouse G3 MBs in collaboration with Myc, even in cells
that maintain wild-type Trp53 (Northcott et al., 2014). Notably,
human primary G3 MBs generally lack TP53 mutations, although
these can accompany relapse (Ramaswamy et al., 2015).
Although Gfi1 bypasses a requirement for p53 inactivation, our
ongoing experiments have so far failed to identify a direct mech-
anistic link between Gfi1 overexpression and the p53 tumor-
suppressor pathway. Collectively, our studies describe how
activities of Ezh2, Myc/Miz1/Max, and Gfi1 combine to drive
G3 MB through concerted mechanisms and point to future
efforts directed to developing a further understanding of how
Gfi1 specifically contributes to G3 MB subgroup specification.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Animal Husbandry
CD-1 nu/nu mice (Charles River Laboratories) were used as recipients for
cortical transplants. All animal experiments were approved by and conducted
in accordance with St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital Animal Care and
Use Committee guidelines, as required by the United States Animal Welfare
Act and the NIH’s policy to ensure proper care and use of laboratory animals
for research.
Vectors, PCR Analyses, Retroviral Integration Site Determination,
and Immunostaining
See Supplemental Experimental Procedures.
Cell Culture, Transfection, and Protein Analysis
GNPs purified from cerebella of 7-day-old Trp53�/�;Cdkn2c�/� mice and
mouse G3 MB tumorspheres (MB1, MB2, MB3, and MB4, previously desig-
nated no. 19251, no. 19554, no. 19568, and no. 9730; Vo et al., 2016) were
cultured on ultra-low attachment dishes. Human recombinant basic fibroblast
growth factor (FGF) and epidermal growth factor (EGF) (PeproTech) were
added to the culture medium every 2 days. For GNP and G3 MB transfection,
1 3 106 cells were transfected with 2.5 mg of each TALEN pair or CRISPR-Cas9
plasmids using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) or Xfect Transfection Reagent
(Clontech). Positive RFP+/GFP+ cells were expanded in bulk or sorted as single
cells into 96-well plates and recovered as subclones. For total protein and his-
tone extractions, cell pellets were lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation assay
(RIPA) and hypotonic lysis buffers, respectively (Morfouace et al., 2014), and
proteins separated on denaturing gels were immunoblotted (Ayrault et al.,
2010) with primary antibodies listed in Table S2.
Retrovirus Infection and Orthotopic Transplantation
G3 MB tumorsphere cells were infected with retroviral vectors for 2 days, and
FACS was used to isolate the RFP+/GFP+ fraction. Cells were expanded in cul-
ture, harvested, and suspended in Matrigel (BD Bioscience) before 5 3 105 cells
were transplanted into the cerebral cortices of CD-1 nu/nu recipient mice as
described (Ayrault et al., 2010; Kawauchi et al., 2012). Animals were examined
daily for symptoms of sickness (doming of the head, ataxia, and reduced activ-
ity). Moribund mice were humanely sacrificed, tumor cells were purified, and
extracted RNAs and proteins were analyzed (Kawauchi et al., 2012). Tumors,
brains, and spines of mice were reviewed for histopathology to evaluate
whether the tumors were G3 large cell/anaplastic and metastatic.
DNA Deep-Sequencing and Ezh2 Mutation Profiles
Endogenous Ezh2 amplicons of exons 10 and 18 from CRISPR-Cas9-targeted
populations were cloned by primers listed in Table S3. Amplicons from different
samples were mixed and barcoded by another round of PCR using a Nextera
Index Kit. The library prepared from the final PCR products of indexed samples
was subjected to 300 bp paired-end sequencing with Illumina MiSeq for each of
the two exon regions. After quality check (score of 25) and size (50 bp) trimming,
reads of each sample were aligned to the sequences of designated regions (the
consensus sequences of Ezh2 exons 10 and 18, generated from the control
samples within the same sequencing run) with more than 10,0003 depth of
coverage, and followed with variant calling using CLC Genomic Workbench.
Finally, an in-house tool was used to filter and summarize the allele frequencies
of variants and to confirm the allele independency of each mutation type. Fre-
quencies of Gfi1 mutations were determined by analogous methods.
RNA-Sequencing Analysis
RNA was extracted from mouse G3 MB and Ezh2-deleted tumorsphere cells
and tumor chunks using Trizol, as previously described (Kawauchi et al.,
2012). FASTQ sequences were mapped to the mouse mm9 genome by a pipe-
line that employs STAR (Dobin et al., 2013) and BWA (Li and Durbin, 2009).
Mapped reads were counted with HTSEQ (Anders et al., 2015). Raw counts
were voom normalized and statistically contrasted using the pipeline limma
in R 3.2.3 (Law et al., 2014). An empirical Bayes fit was applied to contrast cells
lacking Ezh2 to control cells and to generate p values and false discovery rates
for each gene. For GSEA and heatmap visualizations, gene level FPKM values
were computed and the data were log2 transformed. Quality control and visu-
alizations were performed using Partek Genomic Suite 6.6 and STATA MP/
11.2. A two-factor ANOVA of the cells lacking Ezh2 was performed and false
discovery rates calculated for a model of genotype, tumor of origin, and the
interaction of the two factors. A two-class comparison of Ezh2-deficient versus
Ezh2+/+ control tumors was examined by GSEA, and the 100 most differentially

 expressed genes were analyzed for gene ontology (GO) category enrich-
ment using Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery
(DAVID). Heatmaps were produced using Z transforms of log2 FPKM data in
Spotfire Decision Site 9.1.2 from TIBCO.
ChIP-Sequencing Analysis
ChIP was performed as previously described (Lee et al., 2006). Briefly, 5–7 3
107 crosslinked cells were resuspended in 10 mL buffer 1 (50 mM HEPES-KOH
[pH 7.5], 140 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.5% NP-40, 0.25% Triton
X-100, and 13 Sigma protease inhibitors) and incubated on ice for 10 min.
Samples were pelleted at 1,350 3 g for 5 min, resuspended in 10 mL buffer
2 (10 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8.0], 200 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM EGTA, and
13 Sigma protease inhibitors) and incubated on ice for 10 min. Pelleted
samples were resuspended in 2 mL Covaris sonication buffer (10 mM Tris-
HCL [pH 8.0], 1 mM EDTA, 0.1% SDS, and 13 Sigma protease inhibitors)
and sonicated using a Covaris E220 focused ultrasonicator. Samples were
diluted with five volumes of buffer 3 (10 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8.0], 100 mM
NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM EGTA, 0.1% Na-deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100,
and 13 Sigma protease inhibitors). Chromatin was subjected to ChIP using
rabbit
polyclonal
antibodies
directed
against
H3K27me3,
H3K27ac,
H3K4me3, and Gfi1 (Table S2). DNA was purified using phenol:chloroform
as described and sequenced (Lee et al., 2006).
We used BWA (version 0.5.9-r26-dev; default parameter) to align the reads
to the mouse (UCSC mm9) genome and then marked duplicated reads with
Picard (version 1.65), with only nonduplicated reads kept by samtools (param-
eter ‘‘-q 1 -F 1024’’ version 0.1.18). To control the quality of the data and esti-
mate the fragment size, the nonduplicated version of SPP (version 1.11) was
used to draw cross-correlation with support of R (version 2.14.0). Upon manu-
ally inspecting the cross-correlation plot generated by SPP, the best fragment
size estimates (the smallest fragment size estimated by SPP in all of our cases)
were used to extend each read and to generate bigwig files to view on inte-
grated genome viewer (IGV) (version 2.3.47). We scaled the bigwig files to
15 M reads so that the heights of peaks between samples are roughly compa-
rable. The heatmaps for different histone marks were generated using ngsplot
(Shen et al., 2014).
Statistical Analysis
The Kaplan-Meier method was used to calculate the significance of mouse
survival. Statistical analyses were performed in the GraphPad Prism software
version 6.0. p values were calculated by an unpaired two-tailed t test from
three independent experiments.
