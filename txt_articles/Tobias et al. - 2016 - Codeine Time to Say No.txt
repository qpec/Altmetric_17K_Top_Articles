abstract
Codeine has been prescribed to pediatric patients for many decades as 
both an analgesic and an antitussive agent. Codeine is a prodrug with little 
inherent pharmacologic activity and must be metabolized in the liver into 
morphine, which is responsible for codeine’s analgesic effects. However, 
there is substantial genetic variability in the activity of the responsible 
hepatic enzyme, CYP2D6, and, as a consequence, individual patient response 
to codeine varies from no effect to high sensitivity. Drug surveillance has 
documented the occurrence of unanticipated respiratory depression and 
death after receiving codeine in children, many of whom have been shown 
to be ultrarapid metabolizers. Patients with documented or suspected 
obstructive sleep apnea appear to be at particular risk because of opioid 
sensitivity, compounding the danger among rapid metabolizers in this 
group. Recently, various organizations and regulatory bodies, including the 
World Health Organization, the US Food and Drug Administration, and the 
European Medicines Agency, have promulgated stern warnings regarding 
the occurrence of adverse effects of codeine in children. These and other 
groups have or are considering a declaration of a contraindication for 
the use of codeine for children as either an analgesic or an antitussive. 
Additional clinical research must extend the understanding of the risks and 
benefi
 ts of both opioid and nonopioid alternatives for orally administered, 
effective agents for acute and chronic pain.

outline the therapeutic and safety 
implications in the treatment of pain 
or cough in children.
BACKGROUND
Codeine (3-methylmorphine) is 
a naturally occurring methylated 
morphine that has seen widespread 
clinical use for >50 years as an 
analgesic and an antitussive agent. 
Historically, codeine was considered 
an optimal oral analgesic for the 
outpatient treatment of acute pain of 
various etiologies in children, partly 
because of the perception that it was 
a safe opioid analgesic with a wide 
therapeutic index and a limited risk 
of respiratory depression. 
6 It was the 
primary agent used for outpatient 
analgesia after adenotonsillectomy 
in children and was recommended 
as a step 2 medication in the World 
Health Organization Pain Ladder for 
the treatment of moderate pain. 
7 
However, codeine itself has no 
analgesic effect; it is a prodrug that 
must be metabolized to morphine to 
be effective. Furthermore, increased 
understanding of pharmacogenetics 
and ongoing safety investigations 
have shown a large variation in the 
conversion of codeine to morphine. 
This genetics-based interpatient 
variation produces considerable 
variability in the therapeutic 
response to recommended codeine 
dosing, ranging from a lack of effect 
because of low morphine levels 
to fatalities related to excessive 
morphine levels. 
8
Despite these concerns and the 
potential hazards, codeine continues 
to be widely available from many 
pharmacies and inpatient hospital 
formularies for use in outpatient 
pediatric settings and is commonly 
prescribed to pediatric patients. 
9, 
 
10 
One study from 2011 reported that, 
among dispensed prescriptions 
for selected opioids, codeine was 
prescribed to >800 000 patients 
younger than 11 years, more than 
any other opioid in the study. 
11 
During the years 2007–2011, 
otolaryngologists were the most 
frequent prescribers of codeine/
acetaminophen liquid formulations 
(19.6%), followed by dentists 
(13.3%), pediatricians (12.7%), and 
general practice/family physicians 
(10.1%). 
11 Two other studies 
reported the use of opioids in 
pediatric emergency departments in 
the period 2001–2010. In 1 study, the 
frequency of codeine administration 
in emergency departments both for 
pain associated with injury and for 
cough remained unchanged during 
this period.9 The other longitudinal 
study covering the same time period 
showed that overall codeine use 
remained constant in adolescents 
but has decreased in younger age 
groups. 
12
In the last 5 years, various 
organizations and regulatory 
bodies have promulgated warnings 
regarding adverse responses 
associated with codeine, as follows:
1. March 2011: The World Health 
Organization deleted codeine from 
its list of essential medications 
for children because of concerns 
that its “
efficacy and safety were 
questionable in an unpredictable 
portion of the paediatric 
population.” 
13
2. August 2012: The US Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA) 
issued a safety alert regarding the 
use of codeine in children after 
tonsillectomy, adenoidectomy, or 
adenotonsillectomy. 
14
3. February 2013: An update from 
the FDA added a “
black box 
warning” to the drug label of 
codeine and codeine-containing 
preparations. The warning 
advises health care professionals 
“
to prescribe an alternative 
analgesic [to codeine] for 
postoperative pain control in 
children undergoing tonsillectomy 
and/or adenoidectomy.” A 
contraindication was added 
to restrict codeine use in such 
patients. The “
Warnings/
Precautions, 
” “
Pediatric Use, 
” and 
“
Patient Counseling Information” 
sections of the label were also 
updated. 
15
4. June 2013: The European 
Medicines Agency issued a report 
recommending the restriction of 
codeine for the treatment of pain 
to children older than 12 years as 
well as a contraindication to its 
use in children younger than 18 
years undergoing tonsillectomy 
and/or adenoidectomy. In 
addition, it recommended against 
codeine use in breastfeeding 
women. 
16
5. June 2013: Health Canada 
announced that it had reviewed 
the safety of prescription pain 
and cough medications containing 
codeine and recommended against 
their use in children younger than 
12 years. 
17
6. March 2015: The European 
Medicines Agency completed a 
review of the use of codeine for 
cough and cold and recommended 
against its use in children younger 
than 12 years as well as children 
and adolescents between 12 and 
18 years who have problems with 
breathing. 
18
GENETIC VARIABILITY IN CODEINE 
METABOLISM
Codeine is a prodrug that has limited 
affinity for the μ-opioid receptor 
and no analgesic effects. After an 
oral dose, the majority of codeine 
undergoes hepatic glucuronidation 
or N-demethylation to inactive 
metabolites. The analgesic properties 
result from hepatic metabolism and 
conversion of the parent compound 
(codeine) to morphine and the 
active metabolite morphine-6-
glucuronide. The conversion from 
codeine to morphine is regulated by 
the cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) 
enzyme system.

October 2016 
The activity of CYP2D6 varies 
significantly as a function of genetic 
polymorphisms. More than 70 
different alleles have been identified, 
with individuals inheriting 1 allele 
from each parent. The level of 
enzyme activity from each allele has 
been broadly classified according 
to the following scheme: normal 
function = 1, reduced function = 
0.5, and no function = 0. The 
enzyme activity for an individual 
is the sum of activity from each 
parent’s allele. On the basis of these 
additive scores, individuals can be 
classified as extensive (score of 
1–2), intermediate (0.5), or poor 
(0) metabolizers. It has also been 
increasingly recognized that some 
individuals may have significantly 
more activity related to gene 
duplication.
The prevalence of the different 
levels of activity varies among 
ethnic backgrounds, with poor 
metabolizers overrepresented 
in people of northern European 
Caucasian descent. Poor metabolizers 
initially received the greatest 
attention because of codeine’s lack 
of efficacy in such patients. 
21 
– 
23 
As our understanding of the 
influence of genetic variations on 
pharmacokinetics has improved, 
attention has become more focused 
on individuals who are ultrarapid 
metabolizers secondary to gene 
duplications. This latter group has ≥2 
copies of the CYP2D6 gene, which can 
result in an enzyme activity score ≥3, 
indicating a very high level of enzyme 
activity. The result in these patients 
is the production of large amounts of 
morphine that can cause respiratory 
depression or apnea, even after 
normal therapeutic doses of oral 
codeine. 
19, 
23, 
 
24 The frequency of the 
ultrarapid metabolizer genotype has 
been estimated at ∼29% of patients 
of African/Ethiopian heritage, 
∼21% of those from Saudi Arabia 
and other Middle Eastern countries, 
and ∼3.4% to 6.5% of African-
American and white persons. 
19, 
 
20, 
 
23, 
24 
Intermediate metabolism tends to 
be more common in Asians than in 
whites, 
 
25 but poor metabolism is less 
common. 
26
REPORTS OF ADVERSE EFFECTS
The evidence linking the use of 
codeine with life-threatening or fatal 
respiratory depression is based on 
a series of case reports that have 
appeared in the literature regularly 
since 2004. 
27 
 
 
 
 
– 
34 The publication of 
these reports initiated an evaluation 
by the FDA, which included a review 
of the literature as well as reports 
submitted to the FDA Adverse Event 
Reporting System from 1969 through 
May 2012. 
35 The search revealed 
13 cases of pediatric deaths (n = 10) 
or respiratory depression (n = 3) 
attributed to the therapeutic use 
of codeine, 7 of which had been 
published in the medical literature. 
The age range was slightly wider 
than the initial reports (21 months 
to 9 years of age). The majority 
occurred during the postoperative 
period after adenoidectomy or 
adenotonsillectomy with the 
recommended codeine dose and 
dosing interval. However, 1 clinical 
study proposed that repeated 
episodes of hypoxemia result in 
altered μ-opioid receptors and 
greater analgesic potency of opioids 
in this setting.36
Three additional pediatric deaths 
related to codeine were reported in 
2013. 
37 These included a 10-year-old 
child who had undergone orthopedic 
surgery, a 4-year-old treated after 
tonsillectomy, and a third child 
who received codeine as a cough 
suppressant, albeit in a higher dose 
than was prescribed.
Most recently, a review by the FDA 
of the Adverse Event Reporting 
System data from 1965 to 2015 in 
children who had used codeine or 
any codeine-containing products 
revealed a total of 64 cases of severe 
respiratory depression and 24 
codeine-related deaths, 21 of which 
were in children younger than 12 
years. 
38
USE OF CODEINE AND ITS 
ALTERNATIVES FOR ANALGESIA
Even before these reports of adverse 
events, many physicians had 
concerns regarding the efficacy of 
codeine, mostly related to its lack of 
effect in a significant proportion of 
the population (poor metabolizers). 
Although CYP2D6 genotyping that 
could identify patients at higher 
risk is available (although currently 
expensive), patients with normal 
metabolism are also at theoretical 
risk of high morphine levels. 
Therefore, further investigation is 
required to determine the value 
of such testing, which will depend 
on the population in whom it is 
applied. As such, physicians are 
faced with considering alternative 
analgesic agents to use when 
oral administration is needed 
postoperatively or in the outpatient 
setting.
In the United States, many physicians 
have switched to prescribing 
oxycodone for analgesia. Oxycodone 
is a semisynthetic opioid that is 
an active analgesic, not a prodrug 
like codeine. Metabolism is via 
N-demethylation by the CYP3A4 
enzyme system to inactive 
metabolites. A minor percentage 
of oxycodone is metabolized by 
the CYP2D6 enzyme system to the 
active metabolite noroxymorphone, 
so ultrarapid metabolizers may 
be at some risk of opiate toxicity. 
Oxycodone is available in a liquid 
formulation both alone and in 
combination with acetaminophen. 
However, data are currently 
insufficient to unequivocally endorse 
the widespread use of oxycodone in 
infants and children. One study has 
shown considerable variability in 
absorption and oral bioavailability 
in children. 
39 Another recent 
preliminary pharmacokinetic study 
in children younger than 6 years 
e3

www.aappublications.org/news
Downloaded from 
 FROM THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS
showed significant differences 
in onset of absorption and peak 
levels of oxycodone and plasma 
concentrations of noroxymorphone 
on the basis of CYP2D6 genotypes. 
40
Hydrocodone is also a potential 
alternative for analgesia, but 
CYP2D6 is responsible for the 
conversion of hydrocodone to an 
active metabolite, hydromorphone. 
Ultrarapid metabolizers may have 
up to an eightfold greater plasma 
concentration of hydromorphone, 
whereas poor metabolizers receive 
minimal analgesia. 
41
Given the problems with codeine and 
potential concerns with the other 
available agents, the use of an oral 
morphine elixir has been suggested 
by some as an alternative. 
20, 
 
42 
However, although there is extensive 
experience with intravenous 
morphine in children, there is little 
clinical experience and very limited 
comparative clinical data on safety 
and efficacy available for the oral 
formulation.
Additional options for pain relief 
include less familiar and less 
commonly used medications, such 
as tramadol. Tramadol has a longer 
half-life (6–7 hours) than other oral 
agents as well as an active metabolite 
with a half-life of 10 to 11 hours. 
Unlike other weak opioids, it has a 
unique dual mechanism of action, 
including agonism at the μ-opioid 
receptor, and inhibits reuptake of 
neurotransmitters (norepinephrine 
and serotonin) within the 
central nervous system. Primary 
metabolism occurs through hepatic 
N-demethylation by the cytochrome 
CYP3A4 enzyme system to an inactive 
metabolite. A smaller percentage 
is metabolized by O-demethylation 
(CYP2D6 enzyme) to the active 
metabolite desmethyltramadol. 
Although preliminary studies in the 
pediatric population have shown 
effective analgesia, 
 
43 
 
– 
46 there are 
reasons to be concerned about 
potential problems with tramadol 
that are similar to those encountered 
with codeine. Although tramadol is 
not dependent on metabolism for 
its analgesic effect, it is partially 
dependent on the CYP2D6 enzyme 
system for metabolism, which could 
lead to drug accumulation in poor 
metabolizers.47 In addition, the 
O-demethylated (CYP2D6-dependent) 
metabolite has a much higher affinity 
for the μ-opioid receptor, and a 
case report of administration of 
tramadol to a child with ultrarapid 
metabolism and subsequent 
respiratory depression was recently 
published. 
48 Furthermore, many 
other drugs, including selective 
serotonin reuptake inhibitors, 
tricyclic antidepressants, and some 
antiepileptic drugs, inhibit the 
metabolism of tramadol, leading to 
undesirable tramadol accumulation. 
As such, further investigation must 
be conducted before the widespread 
use of tramadol in children for pain 
relief.
A similar agent, tapentadol, is a 
centrally acting analgesic with a 
dual mode of action as an agonist 
at the μ-opioid receptor and as a 
norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor 
within the central nervous system. In 
contradistinction to tramadol, it has 
only weak effects on the reuptake of 
serotonin and is a significantly more 
potent opioid agonist. It has no active 
metabolites. It was approved by the 
FDA in 2011 for use in adults; to date, 
there are no data regarding its use in 
the pediatric population. There is 1 
report from a poison control center 
review of 124 unintended exposures, 
one of which resulted in coma and 
respiratory depression in a 9-month-
old child. 
49
Concerns regarding opioids in 
children with sleep-disordered 
breathing have led to a reevaluation 
of postoperative nonopioid 
analgesics, such as acetaminophen 
and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory 
drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen, 
for children with mild to moderate 
pain. 
50 
 
 
–54 In addition, there are 
intravenous formulations of 
acetaminophen and an NSAID 
(ketorolac). 
55, 
 
56 Although previously 
thought to potentially increase 
the incidence of postoperative 
bleeding, some evidence suggests 
that NSAIDs can be incorporated into 
the postoperative regimen without 
adversely affecting the postoperative 
course in most children without 
underlying bleeding diatheses. 
53, 
 
54 
The effective use of these nonopioid 
agents may significantly reduce 
or, in some cases, eliminate the 
need for opioids. Further studies 
of other nonopioid analgesics, 
including dextromethorphan and 
dexmedetomidine, are also needed.
It is clear that one of the keys to 
improving analgesia and reducing 
opioid-related adverse effects is both 
provider and parental education 
regarding the effective use of 
nonopioid analgesics. 
1, 
 
57 The answer 
may not lie in using more medication 
or different medications but merely 
using more effectively other options 
that are currently available.
USE OF CODEINE AS AN ANTITUSSIVE 
AGENT IN CHILDREN
Codeine is also prescribed as an 
antitussive agent and is still available 
in over-the-counter cough and cold 
formulations without a prescription 
from outpatient pharmacies in 
28 US states and the District of 
Columbia. 
38 However, neither the 
value of suppressing cough nor the 
effectiveness of codeine in children 
with acute illnesses has been 
shown, 
 
58 
– 
60 and the risks of codeine 
administration described previously 
also apply to children receiving this 
agent as an antitussive agent. In 
April 2015, the European Medicines 
Agency announced that codeine must 
not be used to treat cough and cold 
in children younger than 12 years18 
and further cautioned that codeine 
is not recommended in children and 
adolescents between 12 and 18 years 
of age with compromised respiratory 
function, including those with

asthma and other chronic breathing 
problems. On July 1, 2015, the FDA 
issued a drug safety communication 
stating that it is investigating the 
possible risks of using codeine-
containing medicines to treat coughs 
and colds in children younger than 
18 years because of the potential for 
serious adverse effects, including 
slowed or difficult breathing. 
61 An 
FDA advisory panel met in December 
2015 
38 and, by an overwhelming 
majority vote, recommended that the 
use of codeine in the treatment of 
cough in all children up to 18 years 
of age should be contraindicated. 
Final agency action on this 
recommendation is pending at this 
time. Alternative therapies for cough 
have recently been reviewed. 
62
SUMMARY
Published reports and clinical 
evidence have shown the potential 
dangers of codeine as an analgesic 
or as an antitussive. Although these 
concerns have been emphasized by 
the FDA, the European Medicines 
Agency, Health Canada, and the 
American Academy of Pediatrics, 
regular codeine administration 
to children continues. 
9, 
 
10, 
 
63 The 
life-threatening events and deaths 
in these reports share a number 
of common features in that the 
majority of the children (1) were 
relatively young, (2) were placed 
on a postoperative pain regimen 
of scheduled acetaminophen and 
codeine, and (3) had undergone 
adenotonsillectomy for sleep-
disordered breathing. However, 
physicians cannot assume that 
such problems will occur only after 
adenotonsillectomy. Given the 
increasing prevalence of obesity 
in the United States, it is likely 
that some patients presenting for 
nonotolaryngologic procedures may 
have undiagnosed sleep-disordered 
breathing and may also be at risk if 
they require extended postoperative 
analgesia.
Additional measures are needed 
to prevent future problems with 
the use of codeine in the pediatric 
population. Improved education of 
parents and more formal restrictions 
regarding its use in children, 
regardless of age, are necessary. 
The evolving information about 
the genetic variability in drug 
metabolism will yield important 
insights to guide physicians in the 
safe and effective treatment of their 
patients. Additional clinical research 
must extend the understanding of 
the risks and benefits of both opioid 
and nonopioid alternatives for orally 
administered, effective agents for 
acute pain.
