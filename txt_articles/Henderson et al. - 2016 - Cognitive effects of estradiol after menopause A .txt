Cognitive effects of estradiol after
menopause
A randomized trial of the timing hypothesis
ABSTRACT
Objective: To test the hypothesis that effects of estrogen-containing hormone therapy on cogni-
tive abilities differ between postmenopausal women near to, and further from, menopause.
Methods: In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, healthy women within 6 years
of menopause or 101 years after menopause were randomly assigned to oral 17b-estradiol
1 mg/d or placebo. Women with a uterus received cyclic micronized progesterone vaginal gel
or placebo. The primary outcome assessed at 2.5 and 5 years, compared between treatment
groups, was change in a standardized composite of neuropsychological test scores assessing
verbal episodic memory. Secondary outcomes assessed executive functions and global cognition.
Results: A total of 567 women were included in modified intention-to-treat analyses after a mean
treatment duration of 57 months. For verbal memory, the mean estradiol minus placebo standard-
ized difference in composite scores (20.06, 95% confidence interval 20.22 to 0.09) was not
significant (2-tailed p 5 0.33). Differences were similar in early and late postmenopause groups
(2-tailed interaction p 5 0.88). Interactions between postmenopause groups and differences
between treatment groups were not significant for executive functions or global cognition.
Conclusions: Estradiol initiated within 6 years of menopause does not affect verbal memory,
executive functions, or global cognition differently than therapy begun 101 years after meno-
pause. Estradiol neither benefits nor harms these cognitive abilities regardless of time since
menopause.
Classification of evidence: This study provides Class I evidence that estradiol initiated within
6 years of menopause does not affect cognition at 2.5 years differently than estradiol initiated
101 years after menopause. Neurology® 2016;87:699–708
GLOSSARY
ELITE 5 Early vs Late Intervention Trial with Estradiol; ELITE-Cog 5 Early vs Late Intervention Trial with Estradiol cognitive
endpoints; MHT 5 menopausal hormone therapy.
With menopause, the cyclic production of estradiol and progesterone ceases. Serum concentra-
tions of these hormones decline steeply and have the potential to affect brain processes associated
with cognition and age-related disorders, such as Alzheimer disease.1 Menopausal hormone
therapy (MHT)—a systemic estrogen with or without a progestogen, usually prescribed for
the alleviation of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms—is used by millions of women,2
despite declines in MHT prescriptions following the Women’s Health Initiative trials.3,4 It is
controversial whether MHT benefits or harms memory and other cognitive skills.5 Clinical trials
have failed to discern consistent, clinically meaningful effects on cognition.5 However, with one
exception,6 large, long-duration trials7 have been restricted to older postmenopausal women.
Some hormone effects on cognition are postulated to vary by age or by timing in relation to the
menopause. MHT, when used by younger postmenopausal women close to time of menopause,
is proposed to enhance cognition, whereas no cognitive benefit accrues from use by healthy older

 postmenopausal women.8,9 However, the tim-
ing, or critical window, hypothesis of cognitive
benefit has not been directly examined within
the context of a randomized clinical trial.
The Early vs Late Intervention Trial with
Estradiol (ELITE), designed to test the timing
hypothesis, was conducted in 2 postmenopausal
strata: women near to menopause and further
from menopause. The randomized interven-
tions were oral estradiol or placebo, and the goal
was to determine if time since menopause as
represented by postmenopause group modifies
the effect of estradiol on specified health out-
comes. For cognitive endpoints (ELITE-Cog),
the primary hypothesis is that the change in ver-
bal episodic memory would differ between post-
menopause groups, with better performance
predicted for women in the early postmeno-
pause group randomized to estradiol compared
to placebo but not for women in the late post-
menopause group.
METHODS Design and setting. ELITE is a randomized,
double-blind, parallel-groups trial of oral 17b-estradiol (1 mg/d)
or identically appearing placebo, conducted at a single academic
medical center site (University of Southern California). Women
with a uterus were assigned cyclic micronized progesterone (45
mg) as a 4% vaginal gel or matched placebo gel, one daily
application for 10 days per 30-day cycle. The endpoint for the
parent ELITE trial is the effect of estradiol compared to placebo
on progression of subclinical atherosclerosis.10 For ELITE-Cog, the
primary research question is whether estradiol initiated within 6
years of menopause affects verbal memory differently than estradiol
initiated 10 or more years after menopause.11 Full protocols for
ELITE10 and ELITE-Cog11 are published.
Standard protocol approvals, registrations, and patient
consents. The study was approved by institutional review boards
of the University of Southern California and Stanford University
and was monitored by an external Data and Safety Monitoring
Board. Participants provided written informed consent. The pro-
tocol is registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT00114517).
Participants. Healthy women were recruited into early and late
postmenopause groups. Postmenopausal status was defined by
absence of vaginal bleeding for at least 6 months (natural meno-
pause) or bilateral oophorectomy (surgical menopause) and serum
total estradiol ,25 pg/mL. Early-group women were within 6
years of a final menstrual period (natural menopause) or bilateral
oophorectomy (surgical menopause). Late-group women were at
least 10 years beyond natural or surgical menopause. Other
exclusion criteria are published.10,11
Randomization. Within each postmenopausal stratum, assign-
ment to treatment group in a 1:1 ratio used concealed stratified
blocked randomization. Other stratification factors were carotid
artery intima-media thickness (,0.75 mm, $0.75 mm) defined
by high-resolution B-mode ultrasonography10 and presence or
absence of a uterus. The computer-generated randomization
sequence was prepared by the study statistician (SAS statistical
software) before trial initiation. Other investigators, participants,
and staff were masked to treatment assignment. Stratified
randomization lists were used to prepare blinded study products.
After determining a participant’s eligibility, clinic staff pulled the
next study product in sequence from the appropriate stratum,
recorded the product identification number, and dispensed the
product.
Endpoints. Recruitment was based on a 5-year trial with
planned treatment of 2–4.5 years. With supplemental funding,
the trial was extended before blinding was unmasked,11 allowing
a third cognitive assessment as participants completed the trial.
Cognitive skills were assessed at baseline, at about 2.5 years (mean
33 months, SD 2.5, range 29–50), and at about 5 years (mean 57
months, SD 5.8, range 36–77). Cognitive assessment used
a comprehensive neuropsychological battery12 that emphasized
standardized tests sensitive to age-related change.
Demographic and clinical variables. Structured question-
naires were used to collect demographic information, medical his-
tory, and medication use. Women used a daily diary to record the
number of hot flashes (mean duration of recording prior to ran-
domization of 40 days, SD 21 days). Physical activity and alcohol
intake during the preceding week were assessed with standardized
interviews. The Center for Epidemiologic Studies depression
scale was used to assess mood.13 After an overnight fast, blood
was obtained for estradiol assays,11 and DNA was extracted to
determine APOE gene isoforms.11
Statistical analysis. The change from baseline for each cogni-
tive endpoint was calculated at both postrandomization cognitive
visits. We used generalized estimating equation models to analyze
repeated measures of change in cognitive endpoints. Independent
variables were treatment group and postmenopause group; cova-
riates included randomization stratification variables and baseline
value of the cognitive endpoint. Differences in cognitive change
were tested by treatment group, by postmenopause group, and
by time (2.5 vs 5 years). We tested our hypothesis with the inter-
action of treatment group by postmenopause group, which as-
sessed whether treatment effects on cognitive change (at 2.5
and 5 years) differed in early and late groups. We assessed whether
treatment effects were consistent in early and late groups across
the 2 test intervals through the treatment-by-postmenopause
group-by-time interaction. No interim analyses were performed.
Sample size requirements for the parent ELITE trial were esti-
mated from the projected mean treatment group difference in the
rate of change in carotid artery intima-media thickness, as
described.10 Sample size estimates to test this interaction (80%
power, 2-tailed a level 0.05, allowing for 25% dropout) yielded
a sample size of 126 in each of the 4 strata. Supplemental funding
was obtained before outcomes were examined to extend the trial
and to increase sample size to enhance power.10,11 For analyses
based on verbal memory, we estimated 82% power (2-sided a of
0.05) to detect differences in the estradiol treatment effect between
postmenopause groups if the early group had a treatment effect size
of 0.5, as suggested by some clinical trials in relatively younger
women,14–17 and the late group had a treatment effect size of 0,
as suggested by clinical trials in relatively older women.18–21 In the
absence of interaction by postmenopause group, we had 80%
power to detect a treatment effect size of 0.22 in early and late
groups combined.11
Primary analyses were conducted separately within each post-
menopause stratum. To guard against a type I error, we tested
our hypothesis with endpoints derived from composite neuropsy-
chological measures. Verbal episodic memory is reported to benefit
from estrogen,14–17 and for this reason the primary endpoint was

 a composite score of 4 measures of verbal memory based on word
list recall and paragraph story recall.11 The secondary endpoint was
a global composite of all cognitive tests.11 Composites were calcu-
lated as weighted sums of component standardized scores weighted
by the inverse inter-test correlation matrix.12 To evaluate estradiol
treatment effects in other cognitive domains, we examined change
in an executive functions composite measure11 and changes in
individual neuropsychological test scores, with Bonferroni adjust-
ment for multiple comparisons.
We specified 2 subgroup analyses.11 The first compared treat-
ment differences on composite cognitive change scores in women
who experienced a natural vs surgical menopause.22 The second
compared treatment differences based on the presence or absence
of hot flash symptoms at baseline. In trials of MHT that included
women with hot flashes, women assigned to active treatment had
better cognitive outcomes.23 Unspecified analyses excluded non-
adherent women or early-group women not within 3 years of
menopause, and we examined subgroups defined by APOE geno-
type, prior use of MHT, or hysterectomy status.
We determined unused portions of the study drug at each
visit. Adherence was calculated as the number of pills taken
divided by the amount that should have been taken. Serum con-
centrations of total estradiol11 at baseline and at 6-month intervals
provided an ancillary measure of adherence.
Classification of evidence. This study provides Class I evi-
dence that oral estradiol 1 mg/d initiated within 6 years of men-
opause does not significantly affect verbal memory, executive
functions, or global cognition differently at 2.5 years than estra-
diol initiated 101 years after menopause. More than 20% of
randomized women were not analyzed at 5 years, and for this
reason the level of evidence for 5-year outcomes is Class II.
RESULTS Participants. We screened 2,166 women
for eligibility. A total of 643 were recruited into early
and late postmenopausal groups. A total of 567 under-
went cognitive assessment at baseline and on at least
one other occasion and were included in modified
intent-to-treat analysis (figure). A total of 567 women
(88%) provided cognitive outcomes at 2.5 years, and
455 (71%) provided outcomes at 5 years (e-Results).
Participant ages ranged from 41 to 84 years. Within
early and late strata, estradiol and placebo groups were
similar on most baseline characteristics (table 1).
Women not contributing to this analysis were similar
to other women in most, but not all, comparisons (table
e-1 on the Neurology® Web site at Neurology.org).
Adherence. The median adherence for estradiol or pla-
cebo was $98% for early- and late-group women.
Eighty-seven women (44 estradiol group, 43 placebo
group) who discontinued study medications before 2.5
years and 56 women (27 estradiol group, 29 placebo
group) who discontinued after 2.5 years but before 5
years contributed cognitive outcomes for analysis. As
expected, median on-trial serum estradiol levels were
significantly higher for women assigned to active
treatment (table 2).
Cognitive composite scores. Compared to baseline, ver-
bal memory and global cognition composite scores
improved in both treatment groups (practice effect);
performance was stable on the composite measure
of executive functions (table 3). For verbal memory,
the mean difference in composite scores of 20.07
between treatment groups—corresponding to a stan-
dardized difference of 20.06 (95% confidence inter-
val [CI] 20.22 to 0.09)—was not significant.
Between-groups
standardized
differences
were
similar in early and late groups (2-tailed interaction
p 5 0.88). Interactions between postmenopause
groups and mean standardized differences between
treatment
groups
were
also
not
significant
for
executive functions (20.04, 95% CI 20.21 to 0.14)
and global cognition (20.025, 95% CI 20.18 to 0.13)
(table 3). Interactions were not significant when time
since menopause was analyzed as a continuous variable
(2-tailed interaction p values: verbal memory 0.80,
executive functions, 0.60, global cognition 0.76).
Expressed in terms of baseline composite scores,
the magnitude of the estradiol–placebo treatment
difference was no more than 1/20th of a SD (verbal
memory, 0.05 SD; executive functions, 0.02 SD; global
cognition, 0.02 SD). Treatment-by-time interactions
and
treatment-by-group-by-time
interactions
for
composite outcomes were not significant (table 3),
indicating that treatment effects did not differ at 2.5
and 5 years.
Individual neuropsychological test scores. There was no
significant treatment effect on any neuropsychologi-
cal task after Bonferroni correction (2-tailed ps .
0.0026) (tables e-2 and e-3).
Type of menopause and presence of hot flashes. Treat-
ment effects on verbal memory, executive functions,
and global cognition did not differ between women
who had a surgical menopause compared to natural
menopause or between women with hot flashes
within the preceding month compared to women
without (table 4).
Other cognitive endpoints. Adherent analyses that
excluded women who took less than 80% of oral estra-
diol or placebo, and analyses that excluded early-group
women not within 3 years of menopause, did not alter
the significance of findings on cognitive composite
outcomes (tables e-4 and e-5). Unspecified subgroup
analyses stratified by the presence of at least one
APOE e4 allele, by use of MHT before trial
enrollment, or by hysterectomy status (women
without a uterus were not exposed to vaginal
progesterone gel) showed no effect of estradiol
treatment on composite neuropsychological outcomes
(table e-6).
Safety. There was one death in the estradiol group and
one in the placebo group. The number of other seri-
ous adverse events was similar in each treatment
group (43 estradiol, 45 placebo) (e-Results).

 DISCUSSION Results of this randomized, double-
blind, placebo-controlled trial fail to confirm the
timing hypothesis for cognitive outcomes in healthy
postmenopausal women. Estradiol initiated within 6
years of menopause did not affect verbal memory,
executive functions, or global cognition differently
than
estradiol
begun
10
or
more
years
after
menopause. During a mean treatment period of 57
months, 1 mg oral 17b-estradiol daily compared to
placebo had no effect on cognitive composite change
scores
in
either
postmenopausal
stratum.
The
randomized design minimized risk of bias, and the
internal validity of trial results is supported by a low
rate of participant withdrawal and by high adherence.
These findings are consistent with inferences derived
from much lower endogenous exposures in study
participants, where baseline serum levels of estradiol
were unassociated with baseline cognitive composite
scores in early- or late-group women.11 Very small
mean differences in cognitive composite change scores
(observed effect sizes ranged from 20.025 to 20.06
SDs) suggest that estradiol does not have a clinically
meaningful
effect
on
verbal
memory,
executive
functions, or global cognition regardless of time since
menopause. Safety profiles were similar in estradiol and
placebo treatment groups.
We did not identify subgroups of women in which
estradiol improved or impaired cognitive function.
There was limited power to detect small treatment ef-
fects in subgroup analyses, but cognitive outcomes
were similar for naturally and surgically menopausal
women, women with and without hot flashes, women
with and without the APOE e4 allele, women who
had and had not used MHT in the past, and women
with and without a uterus. Findings were similar
when we examined a narrower early window that
included only women within 3 years of menopause.
In some trials of younger postmenopausal women,
estrogen improved cognitive skills, particularly verbal
episodic memory.15,17,24 External validity is challenged,

 however, by small sample sizes and short treatment
durations, and results from larger, longer-duration tri-
als6,18–21,25–29 imply the absence of meaningful cognitive
effects.5,7 Prior trials, however, were conducted within
restricted age ranges that failed to accommodate both
younger and older postmenopausal women,6,18–21,25–29
thus precluding the ability to identify possible differ-
ences in cognitive outcomes based on age or timing.
Moreover, generalizability is limited by the exclusion of
women most likely to consider MHT for approved
clinical indications, the use of estrogens other than
estradiol, and the use of continuously administered
synthetic progestogens.
The primary indication for MHT is treatment of
vasomotor symptoms, more common among younger
postmenopausal women closer to menopause. With
one exception,6 larger, longer-duration trials have
been conducted principally or exclusively in women
aged 65 and older.18–21,25–29 Recent myocardial infarc-
tion and stroke are contraindications to MHT; 2
trials were restricted to women with coronary heart
disease18 or cerebrovascular disease.19 For early-group
women, ELITE-Cog results are supported by null
findings in a 2.85-year trial of younger postmeno-
pausal women using relatively low doses of conju-
gated estrogens or transdermal estradiol6 and by
follow-up analyses from the Women’s Health Initia-
tive, which found no residual cognitive effect of con-
jugated estrogens allocated to women aged 50–55
years, approximately 7 years after trial termination.30
In ELITE-Cog, women with a uterus allocated to
estradiol received cyclic micronized vaginal progester-
one for uterine protection. Most larger trials studied
cognitive outcomes of conjugated estrogens,18,20,21,25–27
whose effects may differ from those of estradiol,31 the
principal estrogen produced by the ovaries during
a woman’s reproductive years. Progesterone receptor
subtypes are broadly expressed throughout the brain,
and progestogens influence neural function.32 Most
larger MHT trials that included a progestational agent
for endometrial protection used medroxyprogesterone
acetate exclusively, often given continuously rather
than cyclically.18,20,26,27 Behavioral effects of this com-
pound differ from those of progesterone,33 and sus-
tained use may impair cognition.34,35
No prior trial has directly addressed the timing
hypothesis in both younger and older postmeno-
pausal women. This hypothesis is best developed
for coronary heart disease outcomes10 and has been
considered for dementia risk36 and cognition.8,9 For
cognition, the critical-window theory finds support
from rodent models, where hippocampal plasticity
and memory performance are affected differently, de-
pending on the age of the animal or timing of estra-
diol replacement after ovariectomy.37,38 Our results,
however, suggest that these findings do not extend to
postmenopausal women.
Our trial has strengths and limitations. To test the
timing hypothesis, we compared younger and older
postmenopausal women within the framework of
a large, long-duration trial, where women in both
groups were randomly allocated to the same estrogen
and assessed with the same comprehensive neuropsy-
chological battery. We demonstrated that prespeci-
fied cognitive outcomes in early and late groups did
not differ. The experimental intervention was estra-
diol, the estrogen most often used in animal studies

in clinical practice. On-trial serum levels of estradiol
were above those associated with meaningful clinical
outcomes in other studies, such as vasomotor symp-
tom reduction and fracture prevention.

Data are shown as median (IQR) levels of total estradiol (pg/mL) during the course of the trial. Assay details have been described.11 Laboratory reference
values for estradiol are 20–150 pg/mL during the follicular stage of the menstrual cycle and ,25 pg/mL for postmenopause. Two-tailed p values were
determined with the Wilcoxon test.
a Women who, by pill count, took at least 80% of estradiol or estradiol-placebo throughout the approximately 2.5 years preceding cognitive assessment at
2.5 or 5 years.

Data are shown as mean change 6 SE (95% CI). All analyses are adjusted for stratum of carotid intima–media thickness, hysterectomy status, time of assessment (2.5 or 5 years), and baseline cognitive score.
a A total of 284 participants in the estradiol group and 283 in the placebo group contributed endpoints at baseline and 2.5 years; 229 participants in the estradiol group and 226 in the placebo group contributed
endpoints at all 3 time points. The total number of cognitive endpoints for early group participants was 426 (225 estradiol, 201 placebo), and the total number for late group participants was 596 (288 estradiol,
308 placebo).
b Difference in mean composite change scores, estradiol minus placebo.
c The standardized difference represents the treatment effect size.
d The 2-tailed interaction p value assesses whether treatment effects differ between women in the early postmenopause group compared to the late group. The primary outcome for this study is based on this
interaction for the verbal memory composite.
e The 2-tailed interaction p value assesses whether treatment effects differ at 2.5 and 5 years.

 Results, however, pertain to healthy postmeno-
pausal women with characteristics similar to those
in our research cohort. Results do not generalize to
women of reproductive age or in the menopausal
transition, to women with primary ovarian insuffi-
ciency or premature menopause induced by surgery
or cancer chemotherapy,39,40 or women with mild
cognitive impairment or dementia. The study lacked
power to exclude small treatment effects in partici-
pant subgroups. It was not designed to assess short-
term cognitive effects of estradiol or effects on risks of
mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimer disease.
ELITE-Cog findings fail to confirm an early crit-
ical window during which estradiol benefits verbal
memory, executive functions, or global cognition.
These results indicate that postmenopausal women
near the time of menopause—in addition to women
further from the time of menopause—should not
expect MHT to enhance cognition. Healthy younger
postmenopausal
women
considering
MHT
for
approved indications need not be overly concerned
that treatment adversely affects these cognitive abili-
ties over a 5-year period.

Data are shown as mean change 6 SE (95% confidence interval). All analyses adjusted for stratum of carotid intima–media thickness, hysterectomy status
(except when type of menopause was the subgroup of interest), time of assessment (2.5 or 5 years), and baseline cognitive score. For specified subgroup
analyses, the number of cognitive assessments was 112 in the surgical menopausal group (51 estradiol, 61 placebo) and 910 in the natural menopause
group (462 estradiol, 448 placebo) and 645 for women with hot flashes (339 estradiol, 306 placebo) and 375 for women without (174 estradiol, 201
placebo).
a The 2-tailed interaction p value assesses whether treatment effects differ between women in subgroups defined by type of menopause, or occurrence of
hot flashes.
b The 2-tailed interaction p value assesses whether treatment effects differ at 2.5 and 5 years.
