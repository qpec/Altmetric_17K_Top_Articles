High-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC) is the most frequent type of ovarian cancer
and has a poor outcome. It has been proposed that fallopian tube cancers may be precursors
of HGSOC but evolutionary evidence for this hypothesis has been limited. Here, we perform
whole-exome sequence and copy number analyses of laser capture microdissected fallopian
tube lesions (p53 signatures, serous tubal intraepithelial carcinomas (STICs), and fallopian
tube carcinomas), ovarian cancers, and metastases from nine patients. The majority of
tumor-specific alterations in ovarian cancers were present in STICs, including those affecting
TP53, BRCA1, BRCA2 or PTEN. Evolutionary analyses reveal that p53 signatures and STICs are
precursors of ovarian carcinoma and identify a window of 7 years between development of a
STIC and initiation of ovarian carcinoma, with metastases following rapidly thereafter. Our
results provide insights into the etiology of ovarian cancer and have implications for pre-
vention, early detection and therapeutic intervention of this disease.

 O
varian cancer is the leading cause of death from gyne-
cologic cancers1, 2. The 10-year survival is < 30% and has
not improved significantly over the last 30 years3. Despite
significant efforts, various screening and therapeutic strategies
have generally not led to improved overall survival4, 5. One of the
major challenges to improved diagnostic and therapeutic inter-
vention in ovarian cancer has been a limited understanding of the
natural history of the disease. Ovarian carcinoma is a highly
heterogeneous group of diseases including different histological
subtypes with distinct clinicopathological and molecular genetic
features that can be generally classified as Type I and Type II
tumors6. Among them, high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma
(HGSOC, the major Type II tumor) is the most common histo-
logic subtype of ovarian cancer, accounting for three quarters of
ovarian carcinoma7–10. Genomic analyses of HGSOC have
identified genetic alterations in TP53, BRCA1, BRCA2, PTEN, and
other genes although few of these discoveries have affected clin-
ical care11, 12. HGSOC is diagnosed at advanced stages in ~70% of
cases, and these women have a significantly worse outcome than
those with early stage disease. Until recently, the prevailing view
of HGSOC was that it developed from the ovarian surface epi-
thelium. However, early in situ lesions that arise from the ovarian
surface epithelium and progress to invasive HGSOC have never
been reproducibly identified.
Insights into the pathogenesis of HGSOC have emerged from
investigating the prevalence of occult ovarian and fallopian tube
(FT) carcinomas in women with germline mutations of BRCA1/
BRCA2 genes13–17. Potential precursor lesions of HGSOC were
identified in the fimbriae of the FTs removed as part of pro-
phylactic surgery16. Such lesions, including a TP53 mutant single-
cell epithelial layer (p53 signature) and serous tubal intraepithelial
carcinoma (STIC)17, 18, have been identified in patients with
advanced stage sporadic HGSOC of the ovary, FT and perito-
neum18. Immunohistochemical as well as targeted sequencing
analyses have shown that FT lesions harbor the same TP53
mutation as surrounding invasive carcinomas17–21. These ana-
lyses suggest a clonal relationship among such tumors but given
the limited number of genes analyzed do not conclusively identify
the initiating lesions nor exclude the possibility of FT metastases
from primary ovarian carcinomas21, 22. Yet additional studies
have evaluated clonal intraperitoneal spread of ovarian cancer
using whole genome analyses, but these efforts did not analyze
precursor lesions such as STICs that may give rise to this
disease23.
In this study, we use exome-wide sequence and structural
analyses of multiple tumor samples from the same individual to
examine the origins of HGSOC. We have previously shown that
the acquisition of somatic alterations can be used as a molecular
marker in the development of human cancer24. Here, we examine
whether the compendium of somatic alterations identified in
different lesions may provide insights into the evolutionary
relationship between primary FT lesions, including p53 signatures
and STIC lesions, ovarian carcinomas, and intraperitoneal
metastases.
Results
Overall approach. To elucidate the relationship among tumors in
patients with HGSOC, we performed whole-exome sequencing of
37 samples from five patients diagnosed with sporadic HGSOC
who underwent upfront debulking (Supplementary Data 1). This
included STIC lesions, FT carcinomas, and ovarian cancers in all
five patients; appendiceal, omental, or rectal metastases in three of
patients (CGOV62, CGOV280, CGOV278); p53 signatures in two
patients (CGOV62, CGOV63); and a STIC lesion in the con-
tralateral FT from the affected ovarian cancer (CGOV280).
In addition, we analyzed isolated STIC lesions from four
patients (CGOV64, CGOV65, CGOV303, and CGOV304), three
of whom had germline pathogenic BRCA alterations and
underwent prophylactic bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, and a
fourth who had bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and hysterect-
omy in the context of a pelvic mass (Supplementary Data 1). For
all patients, laser capture microdissection (LCM) was used to
isolate lesions after immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining of p53
in STICs and p53 signatures if these contained a TP53 missense
mutation or after hematoxylin staining if the samples contained a
TP53 nonsense mutation (Fig. 1). All other samples were
microdissected after hematoxylin staining. Whole blood, normal
ovarian stroma, normal FT stroma, or normal cervix were used as
control samples.
To identify genetic alterations in the coding regions of these
cancers, we used next-generation sequencing platforms to
examine entire exomes in matched tumor and normal specimens
of all patients (Fig. 1). This approach allowed us to identify non-
synonymous and synonymous sequence changes, including
single base and small insertion or deletion mutations, as well
as copy number alterations in coding genes. Given the
challenges of exome-wide analyses of small tumor samples
observed in STICs and p53 signature lesions, we developed
experimental and bioinformatic approaches for detection of
somatic alterations from laser capture microdissected tissue.
These included optimized approaches for microdissection of
STICs and p53 signatures after immunohistochemical staining,
improved DNA recovery from laser captured material, library
construction from limited and stained tissue samples, and error
correction

(Methods
section).
The
analyses
of
p53
signatures
were
particularly challenging because these are extremely small
lesions, representing 10–30 cells per section and less than
several hundred cells total that result in minute amounts (less
than a few ng) of isolated DNA. We optimized these approaches
using a targeted next-generation sequencing approach analyzing
120 genes in a subset of samples from patient CGOV62, and
then used whole-exome analyses to evaluate coding sequence
alterations in all samples (Supplementary Data 2–4). We
obtained a total of 719 Gb of sequence data, resulting in an
average per-base sequence ~178-fold total coverage (~112-fold
distinct coverage) for each tumor analyzed by whole-exome
sequencing (Supplementary Data 2).
Analysis of sequence and structural changes. Whole-exome
sequence analyses of the tumor samples from each patient
identified somatic mutations that were present in all neoplastic
samples analyzed as well as specific changes that were present in
individual or subsets of tumors (Fig. 2). As expected, we identified
sequence changes in the TP53 tumor suppressor gene, a well-
known driver gene in HGSOC, in all cases. The TP53 alterations
were identical in all samples analyzed for each patient including
in the p53 signatures, the STIC lesions, and other carcinomas.
These data suggest that mutation of TP53 was among the earliest
initiating events for HGSOC development as all lesions harbored
this alteration.
IHC staining for p53 did not identify any nuclear positive
staining of p53 on the ovarian surface epithelium in any of the
cases that had TP53 missense mutation, whereas all carcino-
mas, STICs, and p53 signatures in the FT were positive.

p53
staining)

from

patients
(CGOV64, CGOV65, CGOV280) did not find any genomic

 These observations suggest that there is no early lesion with
TP53 mutation in the surface epithelium or other normal
regions within the ovary.
Because TP53 mutations are expected to be clonal and were all
homozygous due to loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of the
remaining wild-type allele (as determined in our subsequent
allelic imbalance analyses), we used the mutant allele fraction of
TP53 in each sample to estimate tumor purity. We further
analyzed sequence alterations in all samples with estimated tumor
purities > 50%, while four samples with tumor cellularities below
this threshold (omental metastasis from CGOV279 and right
ovarian tumor from CGOV278) or that were miliary carcinomas
(rectal and sigmoidal metastases from CGOV63) were only
analyzed for structural changes.
Using a high-sensitivity mutation detection pipeline, we

 sequence alterations per tumor sample. Candidate alterations were
evaluated across samples in an individual to determine if they
were present in multiple neoplastic lesions or were unique to a
particular sample. To allow for the possibility that a subclone may
have developed in a tumor lesion prior to becoming a dominant
clone at another location, we determined if genetic alterations that
were present in one tumor were also present in a low fraction of
neoplastic cells of other lesions. This method required high
coverage of analyzed alterations in all samples and excluded
potential artifacts related to mapping, sequencing or PCR errors,
allowing specific detection of alterations present in ≥ 1% of
sequence reads (see Methods section for additional information).
The composition of sequence alterations was relatively similar
among the affected lesions of each patient. For example, for
CGOV62, the STIC lesion, FT carcinomas, left and right ovarian
cancers, and all three metastatic lesions harbored a common set
of somatic mutations (Fig. 2). In CGOV63, CGOV279, and
CGOV278, while most of the sequence alterations were the same
among the tumors of each patient, a subset of mutations could
distinguish the STIC lesions and FT carcinomas from ovarian
cancers or intraperitoneal metastases.
Given the importance of chromosomal instability in HGSOC11,
we extended our analyses to examine structural variation in the
multiple tumors of each patient. We focused on regions of allelic
imbalance that can result from the complete loss of an allele
(LOH) or from an increase in copy number of one allele relative
to the other. We divided the genome into chromosome segments
and for each segment compared the minor allele (B-allele)
frequency values in tumor and normal samples using the ~17,000
whole-exome
germline
heterozygous
single-nucleotide
poly-
morphisms (SNPs) observed (Fig. 3, Supplementary Figs. 1–9
and Supplementary Data 7–11). Overall, we observed that an
average of ~26% (range 12–39%) of the genome had chromoso-
mal imbalances in the samples analyzed (Fig. 3).
Integration of sequence and structural alterations identified an
average of 47 alterations per sample (range 21–74) (Fig. 2). The
combination of both types of alterations allowed robust genomic
differentiation between STICs and ovarian cancers or metastatic

Fig. 2 Somatic mutation and allelic imbalance profiles among different tumor lesions. Somatic mutations and segments of allelic imbalance detected by
whole-exome analyses are indicated as colored cells in rows for all patients. Darker shades of each color indicate somatic mutations while lighter shades
indicate allelic imbalances. The tumor samples analyzed for each patient are indicated in columns (p53 sig, p53 signature; STIC, serous tubal intraepithelial
carcinoma). For ovarian tumors in CGOV62 and STIC lesions in CGOV63 multiple blocks are indicated, including one ovarian tumor where multiple
sections were analyzed after hematoxylin and eosin staining or after immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining of p53. These analyses indicated that staining
methods did not affect detection of somatic alterations. The color of mutations indicates the degree of relatedness among tumor samples: red, shared
among all tumor samples with TP53 highlighted at the top row; green, shared among all tumor samples except p53 signature lesion; purple, shared among
fallopian tube tumor and omental metastasis; blue indicates mutations that were first detected in the ovarian tumors; and gray indicates mutations that
were only detected in metastatic lesions. Additional color shades or patterns indicate mutations that are localized to specific lesions or lost due to
chromosome loss as shown in the legend

 lesions in all patients analyzed. In patient CGOV62, a LOH of 9q
(70.8–131.7 Mb) provided a clear difference between the STIC
and all other carcinomas analyzed (Figs. 2 and 3). Likewise,
chromosomal changes in 7q represented a distinguishing feature
between the right STIC or right FT tumors and the remaining
lesions (ovarian cancers, omental metastasis, and left STIC) in
CGOV280 (Figs. 2 and 3). In patient CGOV279, multiple regions
of allelic imbalance were present in a STIC near the FT
carcinoma, while these were absent in a STIC that was not
adjacent to this lesion.
Evolutionary relationship of neoplastic lesions. As somatic
genetic alterations can be used to recreate the evolutionary history
of tumor clones, we used the somatic sequence mutations and
chromosomal alterations observed in each patient to determine
the history of tumor clonal evolution. We employed a subclone
hierarchy inference tool called SCHISM (SubClonal Hierarchy
Inference from Somatic Mutations) which enables improved
phylogenetic reconstruction by incorporating estimates of the
fraction of neoplastic cells in which a mutation occurs (mutation
cellularity)25. We estimated the cellularity of each mutation by
correcting the observed allele frequencies for tumor purity and
copy number levels (Methods section). In addition to the
observed structural alterations, this approach allowed us to use
213
synonymous
and
non-synonymous
somatic
sequence
alterations to construct the phylogenetic trees illustrated in Fig. 4
and Supplementary Data 5.
A SCHISM tree node represents cells harboring a unique
compartment of mutations defining a subclone whereas an edge
represents a set of mutations acquired by the cells in the progeny
nodes that distinguish them from the cells in the parental node.
By definition, for an individual cancer there could only be one
parental clone, although there could be many different progeny
subclones representing invasive or metastatic lesions or further
evolution of the primary tumor. The optimal hierarchy among
subclones is determined by examining all possible pairwise
relationships between somatic alterations, and performing a
heuristic search over the space of phylogenetic trees to identify a
model that best explains the observed alterations.
In all samples, the SCHISM analysis of sequence and structural
alterations suggested that the p53 signature or STIC lesions
contained the ancestral clone for the observed cancers (Fig. 4).
This evolutionary relationship was strengthened by the observa-
tion that nearly all of the alterations within the p53 signature and
STIC lesions were shared by all other lesions. For example, the
ovarian tumors of all cases displayed alterations that were shared
in FT lesions but also contained additional changes, suggesting
that these represented daughter clones of the latter tumors
(Fig. 2). Likewise, the ovarian cancers or their immediate
precursors were likely the direct parental clones for the metastases
in CGOV62, CGOV278, and CGOV280 as demonstrated by the
shared alterations that were not contained in earlier FT lesions.
Overall, the phylogenetic model generated by these data suggests
a progression from FT epithelium to p53 signatures and to STIC
lesions which are then precursors of FT carcinoma, ovarian

Fig. 3 Genome-wide allelic imbalance profile. Minor allele frequency of heterozygous SNPs identified from normal tissue in each patient are derived in each
tumor sample, enabling assessment of allelic imbalance in ~17,000 loci across the exome. Circular binary segmentation (CBS) is applied to minor allele
frequencies of SNPs with minimum coverage of 10× in each tumor sample, and the resulting segment means are shown as a heatmap. Asterisks indicate
samples where corresponding mutation analyses were not performed due to low tumor purity (omental metastasis of CGOV279, right ovarian tumor of
CGOV278) or miliary pattern of tumor samples (peritoneal metastases of CGOV63). Given the relatively lower number of distinct DNA molecules
available from the p53 signature samples from CGOV62 and CGOV63, these samples were subjected to a more sensitive LOH analysis (Methods,
Genome-wide imbalance analysis) and are not shown here

 carcinoma, and metastatic lesions. In addition to the sequential
accumulation of alterations in this linear evolution, we also
observed branching phylogenetic trees due to continued evolution
within STIC lesions as well as FT carcinomas and ovarian
carcinomas (Fig. 4). We compared evolutionary trees resulting
from
SCHISM
analysis
with those
derived
by
maximum
parsimony phylogeny using PHYLIP and the results were similar
in all cases (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Fig. 11).
Interestingly, patient CGOV280 had a right STIC, a right
fallopian carcinoma, and a right ovarian cancer but also had a
STIC in the left FT (Supplementary Fig. 5). In this case the
SCHISM analysis suggested that the lesion in the left FT which
was pathologically determined to be a STIC actually represented a
metastatic lesion of the right ovarian cancer (Fig. 4). This lesion
shared nearly all the alterations of the ovarian cancer but
contained 10 single base substitutions and four additional regions
of allelic imbalance on chromosomes 1, 13, and 22, and both the
left STIC and right ovarian cancer had an additional region of
allelic imbalance on chromosome 7 that was absent in the right
STIC (Figs. 2 and 3). These observations are consistent with the
above model of STIC to ovarian cancer progression, but suggest
that in advanced disease ovarian cancers may also seed metastatic
deposits throughout the peritoneum, including to the FT on the
contralateral side.
Genomic alterations in isolated STICs. Neoplastic cells observed
in the FTs rather than the ovaries removed from carriers of
germline mutation of BRCA1 and BRCA2 provided the first
indication of the FT as a potential cell of origin of HGSOC15, 26.
Since < 1.25% of HGSOC are diagnosed with stage I disease22,
BRCA carriers provide a unique opportunity to analyze genomic
alterations in isolated STICs without associated HGSOC. We
examined neoplastic samples from three individuals with germ-
line BRCA alterations where STIC lesions were incidentally
identified after prophylactic bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, and
one patient where two STICs were identified after resection of a
pelvic mass (Supplementary Data 1). We identified BRCA1 or
BRCA2 sequence alterations or deletions in the germline of three
of these patients (BRCA1 Q1200X, BRCA2 L2653P, and a BRCA2
55 kb
hemizygous
deletion
in
CGOV65,
CGOV64,
and
CGOV304, respectively), as well as somatic mutations in TP53,
and LOH of both chromosome 13 and 17, encompassing the
BRCA1, BRCA2, and TP53 loci in all of these cases (Supple-
mentary Figs. 6, 7, 8, and 9). Whole-exome analyses showed that
the STIC lesions contained a total of 91, 23, 34, and 46 non-
synonymous and synonymous somatic mutations, in CGOV65,
CGOV64, CGOV303, and CGOV304, respectively. Overall, these
analyses revealed that STICs in isolation in patients with or
without germline BRCA changes have a roughly similar number
of sequence changes to STICs in patients with sporadic tumors.
These observations provide evidence that isolated STICs may act
as precursors in the same manner as those identified in patients
with sporadic advanced stages HGSOC analyzed in this study.
Recurrent molecular alterations. We examined tumors from the
nine patients to identify recurrent non-silent sequence or chro-
mosomal changes. Although no genes other than TP53 were
mutated in all patients analyzed, we identified mutations in ten
genes that were altered in two or more patients (Supplementary
Data 6). These included mutations in the tumors of two patients
of the PIK3R5 gene that encodes a regulatory subunit of the PI3-
kinase complex. CGOV64 also had a somatic alteration in PTEN
that together with changes in PIK3R5 highlight the importance of
the PI3K pathway in ovarian cancer11. Additional genes that were
observed to be altered in other ovarian cancers through other
large scale sequencing efforts such as TCGA11 are indicated in
Supplementary Data 6.
In addition to recurrent sequence changes, we found altera-
tions in regions of allelic imbalances encompassing several tumor
suppressor genes involved in ovarian cancer. Remarkably, these
included losses of BRCA1, BRCA2, and TP53 in all nine patients,
and loss of PTEN for CGOV62, CGOV63, CGOV280, and
CGOV64 (in addition to the somatic sequence alterations of these
genes) (Supplementary Figs. 1–9). In all cases, the LOH observed
in the metastatic lesions and ovarian tumor lesions for regions
encompassing these genes were already present in the FT tumor

Fig. 4 Schematic of tumor evolution. The history of tumor evolution in each patient is modeled as a subclonal hierarchy inferred from the somatic
mutations and large scale genomic regions harboring loss of heterozygosity (LOH features) using the SCHISM framework, and is depicted as a tree. Each
tree starts from a root node corresponding to the normal fallopian tube epithelium (germline). In all patients, mutations in TP53 (red boxes) are among the
earliest somatic alterations and are ubiquitously present in all tumor samples. Somatic alterations (boxes) are acquired along edges (arrows) of the tree,
and example alterations are indicated in each case. Nodes of the tree represent cells whose genotype is described by the presence of somatic mutations
and LOH features on the path connecting the node to the root of the tree. Each node is labeled with tumor samples harboring all upstream and lacking any
downstream alterations. The trees inferred for all patients support a pattern of evolution with p53 signatures and STIC lesions as early events in
tumorigenesis. Mutation clusters and LOH feature groups follow the same color code as Fig. 2

 and STIC lesions. Considering the evolutionary model above,
these data suggest that a combination of sequence changes in a
few genes including TP53 together with loss of the TP53 wild-type
allele as well as BRCA1, BRCA2, and PTEN may be crucial early
events that are needed for the initiation of STICs27, 28.
Evolutionary timeline of ovarian cancer development. To esti-
mate the time between the development of the earliest neoplastic
clones in the FT and the development of ovarian and other
metastatic lesions we used a mathematical model for comparative
lesion analysis24, 29. This model estimates the time interval
between a founder cell of a tumor of interest and the ancestral
precursor cell assuming that mutation rates and cell division
times are constant throughout a patient’s life (Methods section).
In patient CGOV62, this model would suggest ~1.9 years between
the development of the STIC lesion and the ovarian cancer (90%
CI, 0.5–4.2 years). For other patients this transition appears to
have been slower as the average time between STICs and ovarian
cancer among all patients was 6.5 years (1.4–10.7 years).
Importantly, in patients with metastatic lesions, the time between
the initiation of the ovarian carcinoma and development of
metastases appears to have been rapid (average 2 years). There
were either no additional mutations in metastatic lesions (e.g.,
CGOV62 omental, rectal or appendiceal metastasis or CGOV280
omental metastasis) or the number of additional changes was
small (e.g., three changes in CGOV278 omental metastasis),
reflecting the ease with which cancer cells located on the ovaries
can subsequently seed additional peritoneal sites. Although the
precise timing of this progression depends on assumptions related
to mutation rates, which may change during tumor progression,
models employing different rates all showed longer timeline from
STIC lesions to ovarian tumors followed by rapid development of
metastatic lesions (Methods section).
Discussion
These results provide a comprehensive evolutionary analysis of
sporadic HGSOC in five patients. Given the unique nature of the
multiple samples we examined from each patient, our study may
have certain limitations not typical of genome-wide efforts. First,
the small size of the tumor samples compared to surrounding
non-neoplastic tissue could potentially lead to low tumor purity.
The high mutant allele fraction of TP53 among cancer samples
(average of 56–85%) indicates that this issue was largely over-
come through LCM. Second, the small number of cells in
p53 signature samples may have limited our genomic analyses for
these lesions. The observation that all sequence changes in
p53 signatures were also present in STIC and other carcinomas of
multiple sites is consistent with our evolutionary model and
suggests that these cells are likely to represent a parental clone of
other neoplastic lesions. Third, our analysis was limited to
ovarian cancers where STICs and other concomitant lesions were
identified, and may therefore not be representative of all HGOCs.
The absence of STIC lesions in ~40% of sporadic HGSOCs is
likely due to an incomplete sampling of the FT or the overgrowth
of the STIC by the carcinoma in the context of bulky disease, but
may also reflect another site of origin that has yet to be deter-
mined for these cancers30. Fourth, this study did not intend to
address the intra-tumoral heterogeneity within the carcinomas
but rather focused on clonal changes within each tumor. Fifth, as
in any evolutionary analyses, the genomic alterations we observed
provide the most likely model of tumor development but do not
exclude the possibility of other relationships. Nevertheless, our
analyses of somatic alterations suggest that models where the
ovarian cancer or metastatic lesions seed the FT tumors20, 21
(including STICs or p53 signatures) are infrequent and unlikely
to be the source of most FT lesions.
Despite these potential limitations, the data we have obtained
provide new insights into the etiology of ovarian Type II carci-
noma and have significant implications for the prevention, early
detection and therapeutic intervention of this disease. The results
suggest that ovarian cancer is a disease of the FTs, with the
development of p53 signatures and STICs as early events. The
subsequent formation of a cancer in the ovaries represents a
seeding event from a primary tumor in the FT that already
contains sequence and structural alterations in key driver genes,
including those in TP53, PI3K pathway, and BRCA1/BRCA2
genes. The recurrent allelic imbalances observed in chromosomes
1, 6, 16, 18, 20, and 22 may suggest additional genes that are
involved in this process. The timing of the progression from
STICs to ovarian cancer in the cases we analyzed was on average
6.5 years, but seeding of metastatic lesions in these patients
occurred rapidly thereafter. This timing is consistent with recent
reports showing a difference of 7.7 years in the age of BRCA
carriers with localized vs. advanced adnexal lesions31. This evo-
lutionary timeline can help explain why most HGSOC patients are
diagnosed at advanced stage (III/IV) with pelvic and peritoneal
spread of disease, and why among asymptomatic BRCA germline
mutation carriers half of the cases diagnosed with asymptomatic
adnexal neoplasia have already seeded to pelvis or peritoneum (>
IA)31. These observations are largely similar to other genomic
analyses of the evolution of ovarian cancer19, 20, 23, 32 as well as the
recent analyses of STIC lesions that were reported while this
study was under review33. Our study highlights the role of
p53 signatures as early lesions in this evolutionary paradigm.
Our genomic analyses are consistent with population-based
studies of the effects of salpingectomy on the risk of ovarian
cancer. Prophylactic bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy has been
shown to reduce the risk of developing ovarian cancer in BRCA
mutation carriers to below 5%34, 35. Likewise, bilateral sal-
pingectomy, performed as a contraceptive method instead of
tubal sterilization, reduced the risk of ovarian cancer by 61% at 10
years36. Our study provides a mechanistic basis for these obser-
vations and has implications for clinical management in pre-
vention of ovarian cancer. In high risk BRCA carriers, bilateral
salpingectomy with delayed oophorectomy should be con-
sidered37
through
participation
in
ongoing
clinical
trials
(NCT02321228; NCT01907789). In non-carriers, our work
implies that for women who undergo surgery for benign uterine
causes, total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingectomy
with sparing of the ovaries should be considered38, and that
bilateral salpingectomy may be a preferred contraceptive alter-
native to tubal ligation. The dual concepts in these recommen-
dations for BRCA carriers and non-carriers are that removal of
the FTs (rather than the ovaries) may be curative as it eliminates
the underlying cellular precursors of ovarian cancer, and that
preservation of the ovaries provides long term benefits due to
decreased risk and fatalities from coronary heart disease and
other illnesses39. A limitation of this approach is that as the
precise timing of when potentially malignant cells shed from the
FT and microscopically seed the ovary is unknown, removal of
the tubes may not provide optimal risk-reduction.
Our observations also have implications for improved detec-
tion of ovarian cancer. Unfortunately, < 1.25% of HGSOC are
confined to the ovary at diagnosis22. Earlier detection of this
disease is likely to benefit from the identification of a precursor
lesion, as has been the case for many other tumor types. Our data
suggest that FT neoplasia is the origin of ovarian serous carci-
nogenesis, and can directly lead to cancer of the ovaries and of
other sites. Currently, the typical histopathologic evaluation of
FTs typically involves a cursory evaluation of one or two

 representative sections. Our study suggests that systematic sec-
tioning and extensive examination of total FTs16 should become
common practice in pathology, and not confined to academic
tertiary care centers. Depending on whether the FTs are removed
for benign conditions, risk-reducing bilateral salpingectomy, or
gynecological cancers, specific examination protocols should be
applied16, 40. Given the window of time that appears to exist
between the formation of FT lesions and development of ovarian
cancer, these insights open the prospect of novel approaches for
screening. Such approaches may be especially important given the
limited therapeutic options currently available for ovarian can-
cer4, 5. Recent advances for ultrasensitive detection of genetic
alterations in blood-based liquid biopsies, pap smears, and other
bodily fluids41, 42, or imaging approaches may provide opportu-
nities in early diagnosis and intervention.
Methods
Specimens obtained for sequencing analysis. The study was approved by the
Institutional Review Board at Brigham and Women’s Hospital and the Johns
Hopkins Hospital and all patients gave informed consent before inclusion. Five
sequential patients with stage III sporadic HGSOC, in whom a STIC was identified
in their FTs (FT), were included. In addition, we included isolated STICs from
three patients with germline BRCA deleterious alterations who underwent pro-
phylactic bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy as well as a fourth patient who had
bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and hysterectomy in the context of a pelvic mass.
All cases underwent complete tubal examination using the SEE-FIM protocol16.
Formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) blocks were retrieved from the pathol-
ogy files at Brigham and Women’s Hospital and Johns Hopkins Hospital within the
3 months following surgical diagnosis and stored at 4 °C to slow down nucleic acids
degradation. All the cases were reviewed by a gynecologic pathologist (M.S.H., D.I.
L., L.S.) that confirmed the diagnosis of STIC and/or p53 signature in the FT. Slides
from each FFPE block, including early lesions, invasisve carcinomas and metas-
tases, were stained with hematoxylin and eosin, and analyzed by p53 IHC staining.
In each FT, at least one STIC and/or p53 signature was identified and micro-
dissected separately. Importantly, STICs were not pooled together if they were in
the same section and were considered separate STICs.
Immunohistochemistry and laser capture microdissection. For accurate
microdissection of early lesions including STIC and p53 signature, IHC staining of
p53 was specifically adapted for LCM as previously described43. PEN membrane
frame slides Arcturus (Life technologies, Carlsbad, CA) were used. Each slide was
coated with 350 ul of undiluted poly-L-lysine 0.1% w/v (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). For
drying, the slides were placed in a slide holder for 60 min at room temperature.
Tissue sections were cut and mounted on the pretreated membrane slides.
Deparaffinization was performed in fresh xylene for 5 min twice, followed by 100%
ethanol for 2 min, 95% for ethanol 2 min, and 70% ethanol for 2 min. Subsequently,
the slides were transferred into distilled water for 5 min. Heat-epitope antigen
retrieval (AR) was performed in Citrate Buffer (Dako, Carpinteria, CA) at low
temperature (60 °C) for 44 h instead of 120 °C for 10 min to reduce tissue and DNA
damage by high temperature. Retrieval solution was pre-warmed to 60 °C before
usage. After incubation in the oven, the AR solution was left to cool down to room
temperature and the slides were rinsed for 30 seconds in fresh 1×PBS then incu-
bated for 40 min with primary antibody anti-p53 (Epitomics, Burlingame) at 1:100
in a humidifying chamber. Before adding the secondary antibody, slides were
washed twice for 1 min in fresh 1×PBS. The secondary antibody, labeled polymer-
HRP anti-mouse (Dako EnVision System-HRP (DAB), Carpinteria, CA) was
applied for 30 min. Then, slides were washed twice for 1 min in fresh 1×PBS.
Chromogenic labeling was performed with 3,3-DAB substrate buffer and DAB
chromogen (Dako EnVision System-HRP (DAB), Carpinteria, CA) for 5 min.
Slides were washed again for 30 s in fresh distilled water. Dehydration was per-
formed as follows: 70% ethanol for 30 s, 95% ethanol for 30 s, 100% ethanol for 30
s, and xylene for 30 s. The stained slides were microdissected within 2 h with the
Arcturus XT LCM system (Life technologies, Carlsbad, CA).
Hematoxylin staining for laser capture microdissection. Invasive carcinomas
from the ovaries, the FTs and intraperitoneal metastases or STICs from patients
with negative p53 IHC staining were microdissected after Hematoxylin staining.
Briefly, deparaffinization was performed in fresh xylene for 1 min twice followed by
100% ethanol for 1 min, 95% for ethanol 1 min, and 70% ethanol for 1 min. The
slides were transferred into distilled water for 2 min before staining with Hema-
toxylin for 2 min. Subsequently, slides were rinsed in distilled water until they
became clear before undergoing dehydration in 70% ethanol for 1 min, 95%
ethanol for 1 min, 100% ethanol for 1 min, and xylene for 1 min. The stained slides
were microdissected within 2 h.
Sample preparation and next-generation sequencing. DNA was extracted from
patient whole blood using a QIAamp DNA Blood Mini QIAcube Kit (Qiagen
Valencia, CA). Genomic DNA from FFPE blocks was extracted from the micro-
dissected tissues using the QIAamp DNA FFPE Tissue kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA).
In brief, the samples were incubated in proteinase K for 16 h before DNA
extraction. The digested mixture was transferred to a microtube for DNA frag-
mentation using the truXTRAC™ FFPE DNA Kit with 10 min shearing time as per
the manufacturer’s instructions (Covaris, Woburn, MA). Following fragmentation,
the sample was further digested for 24 h followed by 1 h incubation at 80 °C. DNA
purification was performed using the QIAamp DNA FFPE Tissue kit following the
manufacturer’s instructions (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Fragmented genomic DNA
from tumor and normal samples were used for Illumina TruSeq library con-
struction (Illumina, San Diego, CA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions
or as previously described44. Exonic or targeted regions were captured in solution
using the Agilent SureSelect v.4 kit or a custom targeted panel according to the
manufacturer’s instructions (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA). Paired-end sequencing,
resulting in 100 bases from each end of the fragments for exome libraries and 150
bases from each end of the fragment for targeted libraries, was performed using
Illumina HiSeq 2000/2500 and Illumina MiSeq instrumentation (Illumina, San
Diego, CA).
Next-generation sequencing data and identification of somatic mutations.
Somatic mutations were identified using VariantDx45 custom software for identi-
fying mutations in matched tumor and normal samples. Prior to mutation calling,
primary processing of sequence data for both tumor and normal samples were
performed using Illumina CASAVA software (v1.8), including masking of adapter
sequences. Sequence reads were aligned against the human reference genome
(version hg18 or hg19) using ELAND. Candidate somatic mutations, consisting of
point mutations, insertions, and deletions were then identified using VariantDx
across either the whole exome or regions of interest44. For samples analyzed using
targeted sequencing, we identified candidate mutations that were altered in > 10%
of distinct reads. For samples analyzed using whole-exome sequencing, we iden-
tified candidate mutations that were altered in > 10% of distinct reads with ≥ 5
altered reads in at least one sample, where coverage at the altered base was at least
as high as the TP53 alteration in that sample, and where the ratio of the coverage of
the mutated base to the overall sequence coverage of that sample was > 20%.
Identified mutations were reported as present in other samples of the same patient
if the mutation was present in at least two distinct altered reads. Mutations present
in polyN tract ≥ 5 bases, or those with an average distinct coverage below 50× were
removed from the analysis.
An analysis of each candidate mutated region was performed using BLAT. For
each mutation, 101 bases including 50 bases 5ʹ and 3ʹ flanking the mutated base
was used as query sequence (http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgBlat). Candidate
mutations were removed from further analysis, if the analyzed region resulted in
> 1 BLAT hits with 90% identity over 70 SCORE sequence length. All candidate
alterations were verified by visual inspection.
Genome-wide allelic imbalance analysis. We performed comparative analysis of
LOH across the tumor samples from each patient to identify copy number
alterations occurring in the course of tumor evolution. Minor allele frequency
(MAF) of germline heterozygous SNPs with minimum coverage of 10× in each
tumor sample were segmented using circular binary segmentation algorithm
(CBS)46. Genomic segments where the difference between tumor and normal MAF
exceeded a threshold of 0.10 were labeled as harboring LOH. In each tumor sample,
the minimum MAF across segments with minimum size of 10 Mb was calculated to
provide a measure of sample purity. Each segment marked as LOH was assigned to
one of the three confidence categories: (1) high confidence, segment MAF within
0.1 of the minimum sample MAF. (2) Intermediate confidence, segment MAF
within 0.1–0.2 of the minimum sample MAF. (3) Low confidence, segment MAF
exceeding the minimum sample MAF by > 0.2.
Next, sample level segments were intersected across the entire set of samples
from each patient to derive patient level segments while accounting for the
possibility of variable segment break points in different samples (Supplementary
Data 7–11). Patient level segments were filtered to keep those covering a minimum
of 20 SNPs and with minimum length of 10 Mb. The resulting segments were
further narrowed down to only include those with high confidence LOH in at least
one of the samples. Genomic segments with LOH in a subset of samples can serve
as informative markers to track tumor evolution similar to somatic mutations. To
increase the specificity in identifying this class of genomic segments, we required a
minimum distance of 0.1 between the MAF of samples with and without LOH. To
minimize the possibility of over-segmentation which could result in inflated
estimates of the number independent structural alterations, we evaluated patient
level segments with boundaries within a 5 Mb window. In cases where the LOH
calls were identical and the difference of segment MAFs were ≤0.05 in all tumor
samples, the segments were merged.
For CGOV62 and CGOV63, the number of germline heterozygous SNPs
meeting the coverage criteria in p53 signature samples was significantly lower than
the other samples from the same patient. Thus, we modified the approach above in
these two patients to enable sensitive analysis of LOH in p53 signature samples.
Initially, the patient level genomic segments of interest were defined excluding

 p53 signature samples. Next, in each genomic segment, the minor allele of each
overlapping germline SNP was determined by taking a majority vote over their
minor alleles in the other samples. The coverage and minor allele read count for
each SNP was derived using samtools (v0.1.19) mpileup module47. The segment
MAF in p53 signature samples were calculated by dividing the sum of minor allele
read counts across all SNPs by the total coverage of SNPs, circumventing the
variance resulting from low coverage at individual SNPs. In each p53 signature
sample, segments with MAF lower than that of the normal by at least 0.1 were
marked as LOH.
Copy number analysis. The genome-wide copy number profiles were determined
by analysis of the ratio of read counts in the tumor and matched normal whole-
exome sequenced samples. In each sample, the number of reads mapping to
genomic bins located in target and off-target regions were corrected for biases
arising from GC-content, repetitive sequences, and target capture process using
CNVKit (v.0.7.6) (https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004873). The log ratio of
the processed tumor to normal read counts provides a measure of copy number in
each bin, and was segmented to yield genomic intervals at constant copy number
levels. The difference in sequencing library size between the tumor and normal
samples is another factor that needs to be accounted for when analyzing reads
ratios in NGS-based copy number pipelines. In CNVKit, the log ratio values in
each sample are adjusted by setting the median of autosomal bins to 0 in log space,
assuming a median ploidy of 2 for the genome. Given the high prevalence of copy
number aberrations in ovarian cancer and the high frequency of allelic imbalance
in the present cohort, this assumption may not be accurate, and will manifest itself
as a genome-wide bias or shift of log ratio values.
Therefore, an alternative approach for normalization of log ratio values was
adopted, which takes into account the level of allelic imbalance in each genomic
region. Briefly, genomic regions with the least degree of allelic imbalance were
identified in each tumor sample, and used in a normalization process based on the
notion that these regions can only be present in an even number of copies. The
distribution of log ratio values among these regions was inspected to ensure that
they belong to the same copy number level. Otherwise, a subset of regions at a
common log ratio (and thus copy number) level were selected. By fixing the copy
number of these segments at a specified level, one can solve for the genome-wide
bias of log ratio values as follows, and thus identify the genome-wide integer copy
number profile.
R ¼ log2
α CNT þ 1 � α
ð
ÞCNN
2
�
�
� δ
In the equation above, R represents the observed log ratio of read counts, α is
the purity of the tumor sample, CNT and CNN are the integer copy number of
tumor and normal samples at a locus, and δ is the genome-wide bias term. Given
the value of tumor purity and copy number, δ is the only unknown in the equation.
To favor solutions with less complex genomes, the copy number of regions with
complete allelic balance was initially set to 2. If the resulting solution was deemed
implausible (e.g., by implying chromosome or chromosome arm scale homozygous
deletions), the copy number of regions with complete allelic balance was assigned
to 4 and an alternative solution was found (Supplementary Fig. 10).
Details of the genomic segments selected to solve for the genome-wide bias term
δ are as follows. In CGOV62, chromosomes 4 and 12 did not have allelic imbalance
in any tumor samples. The solution assigning copy number two to these regions
implied homozygous deletion of the p-arm of chrX in multiple samples; therefore,
the simplest plausible solution assigned them to four copies. In CGOV63,
chromosomes 6 and 15 did not have allelic imbalance in any of the tumor samples,
and were assigned to two copies. No complete chromosome with absence of allelic
imbalance across all tumor samples could be found in CGOV278. Therefore, four
genomic regions with no allelic imbalance were selected for the normalization
process above. These regions were chr8:38–69 Mb, chr12:62–85 Mb, chr18:7–19
Mb, chr20:23–35 Mb. The solution assigning these regions to two copies resulted in
an implausible assignment of homozygous deletion to chr5:50–136 Mb. Therefore,
assignment of four copies to the selected regions results in the simplest solution. In
CGOV279, two genomic regions were selected for the normalization procedure:
chr5: 64–131 Mb, chr20:17–36 Mb. Evaluation of log ratio values suggested that the
two regions are present at different copy levels, as evidenced by a difference of
~0.60 in the log ratio values. The region on chr5, which had the lower log ratio
level, was assigned to copy number 2. In CGOV280, chr16q had no allelic
imbalance in any samples excluding the left FT STIC. Examination of log ratio
values of chr16q in the left FT STIC supports a copy loss in that sample. The
genome-wide bias term δ was determined by assignment of two copies to chr16q in
the four samples with no allelic imbalance, and one copy in the left FT STIC.
Subclonal hierarchy analysis. The tumor subclonality phylogenetic reconstruc-
tion algorithm SCHISM25 was used to infer tumor subclonal hierarchies from the
set of confidently called somatic mutations in each patient. Given the estimates of
genome-wide copy number profile, most copy number aberrations seem to occur
early in the evolution of disease and are common across the lesions analyzed from
each patient. Thus, the majority of somatic mutations can be assumed to occur
following the acquisition of copy number aberrations, and can be present in cancer
cells with multiplicity of one (one mutated copy per cell). Using this assumption,
we can estimate mutation cellularity (or cancer cell fraction) from the observed
reference and alternate read counts, and estimates of copy number, and tumor
purity as follows.
Vexp ¼
mαC
α CNT þ 1 � α
ð
ÞCNN
In the equation above, Vexp is the expected variant allele frequency of the
mutation, m is the multiplicity of the mutation which is set to 1, α is the purity of
the tumor sample, C is the cellularity of the mutation, and CNT and CNN are the
integer copy number of tumor and normal sample at the locus of the mutation. The
observed alternate read count of the mutation can be modeled as a binomial
random variable drawn from a distribution with probability parameter equal to
Vexp and number of trials equal to the total sequence coverage of the mutation. We
calculated the likelihood for observation of the alternate read counts for cellularity
values spanning the range of 0–1 in increments of 0.01, and derived the maximum
likelihood estimate and confidence interval for the mutation cellularity.
To obtain reliable estimates of mutation cellularity, we clustered mutations by
joint presence or absence across the available tumor samples. This approach makes
phylogenetic reconstruction more tractable and the cellularity of the resulting
clusters can be estimated with higher accuracy than that of individual mutations.
For each patient, a mutation was called as present or absent in each of the available
tumor samples (10 samples from CGOV62, 6 samples from CGOV63, 5 samples
from CGOV280, 4 samples from CGOV279, and 3 samples from CGOV278). To
call the mutation present, we used a minimum allele frequency of 2% and 2 distinct
mutant reads. Mutation clustering was performed by a greedy algorithm. Tumor
purity in each tumor sample was estimated as the read count fraction of TP53
mutation in each patient. Each patient harbored a single distinct TP53 mutation
that was present in all tumor samples, and we assumed the wild-type allele was lost,
as supported by the ubiquitous LOH of chromosome 17. To derive a more
comprehensive view of the evolution of these samples, we extended the original
SCHISM framework to model acquisition of large scale somatic copy number
alterations, which can be detected by analysis of allelic imbalance (including LOH).
First, we extracted a set of high confidence genomic regions with ubiquitous,
partially shared, or private LOH in tumor samples of each patient (Methods
section). These regions of LOH served as binary features that could be used for
evolutionary analysis, and were clustered into LOH feature groups with identical
patterns of presence or absence across samples (Fig. 2). Each LOH feature group
was compared to the somatic mutation clusters in each patient, with respect to its
pattern of presence or absence across samples. In cases where a mutation cluster
with the identical pattern could be found, the cluster and the LOH feature group
were assumed to have occurred together in the course of tumor evolution.
Otherwise, the LOH feature groups were modeled as distinct features, and added in
post-hoc analysis by application of the lineage precedence rule from SCHISM;
which requires cellularity of ancestor alterations to be greater than or equal to
cellularity of descendant alterations in all tumor samples.
SCHISM was run with the above inputs and default parameter settings to infer
the order of somatic alterations and thus define subclonal hierarchy in each patient.
SCHISM software is freely available for non-profit use at http://karchinlab.org/
appSchism.
Evolutionary trees resulting from SCHISM analysis were compared with those
derived by maximum parsimony phylogeny using PHYLIP (Phylip-3.695, PARS
method). For CGOV280, an adjustment to the tree was applied to account for
multiple subclones in Right FT STIC.
Estimating an evolutionary timeline. Following the approach of Jones et al.29, the
observed data are the number of somatic mutations in the STIC (nj), the number of
mutations in the metastasis (nk), and the age at which the patient was diagnosed
(tk), where somatic mutations include both sequence and structural alterations.
Unknown is the birthdate (tj) of the cell that was the last common ancestor of the
STIC and the metastasis. Assuming the mutation rate of somatic passenger
mutations and the length of the cell cycle is constant, the number of somatic
mutations in the metastasis cell that were present in the STIC follows a binomial
distribution with parameters nk and probability tj/tk. As tj is unknown, we posit a
conjugate beta probability distribution on the rate tj/tk with shape parameters a and
b estimated from previous studies as described below. The posterior distribution of
tj/tk is β (a + nj, b + nk−nj) from which 90% highest posterior density intervals can
be constructed with point estimates for the birthdate reported as the posterior
mean. For simplicity, we refer to the highest posterior density as a confidence
interval. To construct a prior for tj/tk, we draw on a previous study of four col-
orectal cancer patients29 where a small number of additional passenger mutations
were acquired by the cell that gave birth to the metastasis. On average, 95% of the
mutations in the original adenocarcinoma were present in the metastases. We
center the mean for the beta prior at 0.95 using shape parameters a = 34 and b =
1.6. Our prior is equivalent to one patient having 34 passenger somatic mutations
in the original lesion and 1.6 additional mutations to be acquired by cells that gave
birth to the metastases. For patients with three samples in a linear tree as deter-
mined by evolutionary analyses (say, samples j, k, and l where sample j is the STIC,
l is the metastasis, and k is an intermediate sample), we first derived the posterior
distribution for tk comparing mutations in samples k and l. Next, we derived the
posterior distribution of tj integrating over all possible values of tk, thereby fully

 incorporating the uncertainty of the intermediate timepoint in the estimate of tj.
We evaluated three additional prior models, and found that that posterior inference
under these alternative models given by 90% credible intervals for tk−tj, results in
qualitatively similar timelines among different lesions in tumor progression.
