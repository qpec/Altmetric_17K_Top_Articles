The Pacific Northwest outbreak of cryptococcosis, caused by a near-clonal lineage of the
fungal pathogen Cryptococcus gattii, represents the most significant cluster of life-threatening
fungal infections in otherwise healthy human hosts currently known. The outbreak lineage
has a remarkable ability to grow rapidly within human white blood cells, using a unique
‘division of labour’ mechanism within the pathogen population, where some cells adopt a
dormant behaviour to support the growth of neighbouring cells. Here we demonstrate that
pathogenic ‘division of labour’ can be triggered over large cellular distances and is mediated
through the release of extracellular vesicles by the fungus. Isolated vesicles released by
virulent strains are taken up by infected host macrophages and trafficked to the phagosome,
where they trigger the rapid intracellular growth of non-outbreak fungal cells that
would otherwise be eliminated by the host. Thus, long distance pathogen-to-pathogen
communication via extracellular vesicles represents a novel mechanism to control complex
virulence phenotypes in Cryptococcus gattii and, potentially, other infectious species.

 C
ryptococcosis
is
a
major
human
and
animal
life-
threatening fungal disease1–3. Globally, most human
infections are caused by Cryptococcus neoformans, with
the related species Cryptococcus gattii causing less than 1% of all
human cryptococcal disease. However, in the late 1990s a near-
clonal lineage of C. gattii became established in British Columbia,
Canada, and subsequently caused a major cluster of human and
animal disease that has come to be known as the Pacific
Northwest Outbreak4. A defining feature of cells within the
outbreak lineage is their ability to proliferate very rapidly within
host phagocytes5. We previously demonstrated that this rapid
proliferation is driven by a ‘division of labour’ mechanism, in
which individual fungal cells coordinate their behaviour to
maximise proliferation of the population as a whole6. However,
the mechanism by which this coordination occurs at a cellular
level has remained enigmatic.
Here we demonstrate that the key regulator of this ‘division of
labour’ process is the release and exchange of extracellular vesicles
(EVs) by outbreak strains of C. gattii. These EVs are efficiently
taken up by infected host macrophages and trafficked to the
fungal phagosome, where they induce rapid proliferation of
the recipient pathogen cell and thereby drive pathogenesis in this
highly virulent lineage.
Results
‘Division of labour’ can be triggered over large distances. We
previously showed that outbreak strains of C. gattii induce the
rapid intracellular proliferation of otherwise non-virulent strains
during co-infection6. To test whether this effect required the
fungal cells to be present within the same host cell, we generated
fluorescently tagged versions of an outbreak (R2657) and non-
outbreak (ICB180) strain of C. gattii and confirmed that these
strains were unaltered from their parental strains in morphology,
growth or stress tolerance (Supplementary Fig. 1). ICB180-
mCherry and R265-GFP were used to infect J774 macrophages
either alone or together. Microscopy observations of infected
macrophages at 2 hours post infection (h.p.i.; Fig. 1a) and 24 h.p.i
revealed that dually infected host cells were exceptionally rare
(2/5479 infected host cells; Fig. 1a), suggesting that isolates do not
need to be in the same phagocyte to trigger ‘division of labour’.
To test this in more detail we infected macrophages with the non-
outbreak strain ICB180 and then used a transwell system
(ThinCertTM) to physically separate C. gattii R265 (an outbreak
strain) from contact with the macrophages while continuing to
allow them to freely exchange particles below the 400 nm
transwell cut off (Fig. 1b). Under these conditions, the presence of
an outbreak strain, but not a non-outbreak strain, in the upper

Fig. 1 Long-distance communication can drive rapid intracellular proliferation in C. gattii. a During co-infection, different strains of C. gattii (R265-GFP shown
in green; ICB180-mCherry shown in red) are rarely phagocytosed by the same macrophage. Bar: 10 μm. The number of infected macrophages containing
both isolates of yeast at the same time is very low at 2 h.p.i. (2 in total 5479 tested macrophages) and at 24 h.p.i (1 in total 3235 tested macrophages). Data
are presented as scattered dot plots with lines representing their medians. Data are representative of results from 8−12 independent experiments with a
minimum of 150 macrophages analysed per sample per experiment. b A schematic representation of the experiment using transwell system ThinCertTM

 compartment of the transwell was sufficient to raise the intra-
cellular proliferation rate (IPR) of ICB180 within macrophages by
2.5 fold (Fig. 1b). Thus released molecules from outbreak C. gattii
are sufficient to recapitulate the ‘division of labour’ phenotype
over large distances.
Capsular material is not sufficient to induce higher IPR. It is
well documented that cryptococcal capsular material, which is
shed during infection, is essential for replication inside macro-
phages8 and can induce potent immunomodulatory effects on a
range of leucocytes9–11. To test whether capsular material is
responsible for triggering the rapid intracellular replication we
observe in outbreak cryptococci we used a non-capsular strain,
R265ΔCap1012 (Fig. 2a), instead of wild-type R265 in the trans-
well system experiment. Unlike wild-type R265, acapsular R265
was unable to induce increased proliferation of intracellular
ICB180 in this system (Fig. 2b). However, adding purified cap-
sular material derived from wild-type R265 was also unable to
recapitulate the raised IPR of ICB180 (Fig. 2b and Supplementary
Fig. 2b). Addition of capsular material to the acapsular strain
R265ΔCap10 in vitro (Fig. 2b and Supplementary Fig. 2a) further
suggested that the presence of an intact capsule secretion pathway
is necessary to trigger raised IPRs in non-outbreak cryptococci.
C. gattii releases extracellular vesicles. Recent findings from a
diverse range of organisms have highlighted the importance of
EVs in long-range cell-to-cell signalling and we therefore con-
sidered whether such vesicles may be produced by C. gattii and
contribute towards ‘division of labour’. EVs are known to be
produced by the closely related species C. neoformans13 but have
not been previously identified in C. gattii. Using an ultra-
centrifugation method13 we were able to purify EVs from the
Pacific Northwest outbreak strain R265, the acapsular strain
R265ΔCap10 and the non-outbreak strain ICB180. Electron
microscopy and nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA)-based
measurement revealed EVs to have a typical spherical shape with
a diameter of 100 nm or less (Supplementary Fig. 3a). Detailed
NTA analysis (Supplementary Fig. 3b−d) demonstrated that EVs
from R265 were significantly larger (26−397 nm, median size of
108 nm) than those from R265ΔCap10 (median 72.8 nm) or
ICB180 (median 86.3 nm), in agreement with data from C. neo-
formans showing reduced EV size in acapsular strains14.
Outbreak-derived EVs enhance the IPR of non-outbreak
strains. To test whether the EVs that are shed by C. gattii may
be responsible for triggering the long-distance proliferation
described above, we infected the non-outbreak strain ICB180 into
macrophages and then added 10 μg of EVs, isolated from the
outbreak strain R265, to the media. Exposing ICB180 to EVs 1 h
prior to infection did not alter subsequent IPR. However,
pre-treating macrophages with EVs before infection led to a small
but significant increase in subsequent IPR and this effect was
dramatically enhanced, in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3c), if
EVs were added to the cells once infection was already established
(Fig. 3a−c).
It has been reported previously that albumin presented in
serum rapidly destabilises EVs15. We therefore considered
whether the presence of serum proteins (in the pooled human
serum (PHS) used to opsonise cryptococci prior to macrophage
infection) might be responsible for the limited impact of EVs on
cryptococci if they were added prior to infection. In agreement
with that, repeating this experiment using the monoclonal
antibody 18B716 (which specifically recognises capsular poly-
saccharide glucuronoxylomannan) instead of serum opsonisation
led to a significantly increased IPR during subsequent infection
(P = 0.0039, Wilcoxon paired t test; Fig. 3b, Ab opsonisation).
Thus EVs act to trigger rapid proliferation in cryptococci but this
activity can be inactivated by the presence of human serum.

 of phagocytosed ICB180 yeasts per macrophage was not altered in
the presence of native or heat-inactivated EVsR265 (P = 0.8742,
Kruskal−Wallis test; Supplementary Fig. 4b). The majority of
infected macrophages contained only one fungal cell, and we
never observed more than three cells phagocytosed within first
two hours of fungal infection (Supplementary Fig. 4b). Thus the
increased IPR values we observe in the presence of R265-derived
EVs do not result from a higher rate of phagocytosis.
Interestingly, only EVs from virulent, outbreak cryptococci
appear to be able to induce this effect, since EVs isolated from
ICB180 were not able to increase the IPR of ICB180 or R265
(Fig. 3d, +EVsICB180). Similarly, exposing R265 to additional EVs
derived from the same strain could not further augment
intracellular proliferation (Fig. 3d, +EVsR265-10 μg) even at higher
vesicle concentration (Fig. 3d, +EVsR265-50 μg). EVs isolated from
the outbreak strain were also not capable of boosting the
intracellular survival of completely avirulent C. gattii strains CBS
8684 and NIH 312 (Supplementary Fig. 6). Lastly, EVs isolated
from the virulent C. neoformans KN99 strain were unable to raise
the IPR of ICB180 (Fig. 3e). Thus, taken together, these data
suggest that EVs act as an ‘accelerator’ of intracellular prolifera-
tion (and thus virulence) within C. gattii, but only for strains that
already have the capacity for low (but not zero) rates of
intracellular proliferation.
Enhanced survival requires proteins and RNA from outbreak
EVs. Heat inactivation of EVsR265 blocked their ability to trigger
enhanced survival of ICB180 cells when added either before or
during macrophage infection (Fig. 3b, +EVsR265hk), suggesting
that the activity of EVs requires either a heat-labile component or
an intact vesicular structure that is rendered inactive by high
temperature. To further test if capsule polysaccharides might have
a role in promoting proliferation of yeasts inside macrophages, we

 used EVs isolated from acapsular strain of R265, R265ΔCap10
(Fig. 4a, +EVsR265ΔCap10) and their heat-inactivated form (Fig. 4a,
+EVsR265ΔCap10hk). Although heat-inactivated acapsular EVs
were incapable of triggering increased IPR under any conditions,
intact EVsR265ΔCap10 showed a small but significant ability to
increase ICB180 proliferation rates when they were present
throughout the infection assay (P = 0.0117, Wilcoxon paired
t test; Fig. 4a, infection). This relatively weak effect presumably
explains why R265ΔCap10 is unable to enhance the IPR of a non-
outbreak strain in the transwell system (Fig. 2b), since the EV
concentration in this transwell experimental setup is much lower
than that used when supplementing with purified EVs. Thus,
while the presence of capsule associated with the EVs significantly
augments IPR, capsular polysaccharides may not be completely
essential for the EV-mediated survival effect.
Next we set out to establish which EV components might be
responsible
for
triggering
augmented
IPRs
(Fig.
4b
and
Supplementary Fig. 5) by selectively degrading different classes
of molecule previously shown to be enriched in EVs from other
species. Removing double-stranded or single-stranded DNA from
within the EVs did not impair their ability to enhance the IPR of
ICB180 cells (Fig. 4c, +EVsR265 dsDNase, +EVsR265 S1 nuclease; see
also Supplementary Fig. 5c). However, removing proteins (Fig. 4c,
+EVsR265 proteinase K; see also Supplementary Fig. 5d) or RNA
(Fig. 4c, +EVsR265 RNases; see also Supplementary Fig. 5c) or
perturbing the lipid composition of the EV with non-denaturing
sodium deoxycholate (Fig. 4c, +EVsR265
detergent; see also
Supplementary Fig. 5a and 5b) all eliminated the ability of EVs
to trigger increased IPR in ICB180. Thus to functional effectively
in raising IPR, EVs must be intact and contain protein and RNA,
but not DNA, cargo.
Fungal EVs are rapidly taken up by murine macrophages. Our
observations suggest that EVs derived from C. gattii are able to
enter infected macrophages and impact on the rate of fungal
intracellular proliferation within the phagosome. To test this
hypothesis, we exposed macrophages to EVs from R265 and then
fixed and stained for cryptococcal polysaccharide, which is a
major EV cargo in cryptococci19,15 but absent from mammalian
EVs. Cryptococcal EVs were rapidly internalised into macro-
phages (Fig. 5a, b), with a strong signal observed within 30 min of
incubation and a more central localisation observed after 60−120
min (see also Supplementary Movie 1). Time-course analysis
showed classical uptake kinetics, with a half time to peak
internalisation of 17.5 min (Fig. 5c).

 A possible complication of this approach is that cryptococcal
capsule is shed both within EVs and as free polysaccharide. To
discriminate between these two sources, we performed imaging
on cells permeabilised with the detergent Triton X-100 at either
0.1% (to permeabilise the macrophage plasma membrane) or 1%
(to
permeabilise
all
membranes,
including
those
of
EVs;
Supplementary Fig. 7a). Using this approach we were able to
demonstrate that overall capsular material detected was the same
in both conditions when free capsular polysaccharide was added
to the macrophages, but significantly higher in the 1% detergent
conditions when EVs are added to the cells (P < 0.0001, Mann
−Whitney test, Supplementary Fig. 7b). Thus the fluorescence
observed in the images above is derived primarily from delivered
EVs and not free polysaccharide.
We wondered whether fungal EVs were freely diffusing across
the macrophage membrane or were actively taken up by host
cells. Treatment of macrophages with the actin polymerisation
inhibitors cytochalasin D and latrunculin A, or the cholesterol-
depleting agent methyl-β-cyclodextrin, all significantly reduced
EV uptake into macrophages (Fig. 5d), suggesting that EV
uptake is an active, rather than passive, process. Surprisingly,
the uptake of capsule was not affected in the presence of the
methyl-β-cyclodextrin
(Supplementary
Fig.
8),
implying
a
different route of uptake for free capsular elements in comparison
to capsule contained within EVs.
EVs colocalise with fungal cells inside host phagosomes. Lastly,
having
established
that
extracellularly
added
EVs
can
be
internalised by macrophages, we set out to test whether these
vesicles can reach the phagosome and interact with engulfed
cryptococci in order to modulate yeast survival. To avoid con-
tamination with EVs released by the phagocytosed fungal cells
themselves, we infected macrophages with the acapsular strain
R265ΔCap10 expressing GFP (Fig. 6a, R265ΔCap10) and then
added EVs isolated from wild-type (capsular) R265 (Fig. 6a,
EVsR265). Thus, only exogenously added EVs can be visualised by
anti-capsular
antibody
18B7.
Within
15 min
incubation,
exogenously added EVs showed a strong colocalisation with
acapsular cryptococci within the host phagosome (Fig. 6a, b).
Interestingly, heat-inactivated EVs also localised rapidly to
phagosomes (Fig. 6a, EVsR265hk), although they are unable to
induce raised IPR in intracellular cryptococci (Fig. 3b), suggesting
that delivery to the phagosome is independent of functionality.
Discussion
Teamwork
between
individuals
presents
an
evolutionary
conundrum, since most collaborative systems in biology are
vulnerable to the evolution of ‘cheaters’ and are thus unstable.
This is particularly true of infectious organisms, in which
selection by the host is intense, and yet ‘division of labour’

 mechanisms of virulence appear to have evolved independently in
unrelated organisms such as Salmonella typhimurium and C.
gattii20. Understanding how such systems are coordinated at the
cellular level is a key challenge for understanding how they may
have evolved. In this report, we provide evidence that ‘division of
labour’ in cryptococci occurs remotely, through release of EVs by
the Pacific Northwest outbreak strain. These vesicles diffuse over
significant distances, become rapidly internalised by macrophages
and then trigger increased rates of proliferation in cryptococci
residing within the phagosome.
Fungal EVs have previously been shown to transmit a proin-
flammatory message to macrophages17,18,21, but to the best of our
knowledge, have not previously been implicated in fungal viru-
lence. Our data indicate that virulence enhancement by EVs
requires the presence of cryptococcal capsule associated with the
EVs, but that capsular material alone is insufficient to recapitulate
the phenotype. Detailed analysis of EV contents from a range of
pathogenic fungi, including cryptococci, has revealed a wide
spectrum of RNAs, short non-coding mRNAs, ribosomal proteins
and proteins linked to virulence, anti-oxidant defence and
pathogenesis that may facilitate yeast survival and prolifera-
tion18,22–29. Our data suggest that RNA and proteins protected by
lipid bilayer are necessary to transfer the virulence in EVs. Future
studies to characterise C. gattii outbreak EVs in more detail and
determine
how
their
contents
trigger
raised
intracellular
proliferation in recipient cells are therefore likely to be of con-
siderable value in understanding how microbes communicate
over substantial distances in order to coordinate virulence
approaches.
Methods
Yeast strains, cell lines, culture media and growth conditions. All reagents
were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise stated. C. gattii and C. neoformans
strains (Supplementary Table 1) and murine macrophage-like cell line J774A.1
(mouse BALB/cN; ATCC® TIB-67™) were cultured as described previously7. In
order to obtain fluorescently labelled strains biolistic transformation was
performed7,30 using a plasmid pAG32_GFP7 for R265ΔCap10 and a plasmid
pRS426H-CnmCherry31 for ICB180.
Validation of stable transformants. For selection of stable transformants three
independent experiments were carried out as described previously31. Growth of
ICB180 and ICB180-mCherry strains was performed in 24-well plates (Greiner) in
liquid yeast-peptone-dextrose (YPD; 2% glucose, 1% peptone and 1% yeast extract)
medium shaking at 200 revolutions per minute (rpm) at 37 °C at the starting
concentration of 0.5×106 cells per ml and was monitored by optical density at a
wavelength of 600 nm (OD600) measurements by a plate reader FLUOstar Omega.

 Linear regressions were calculated using GraphPad Prism Software Inc. Cell size of
ICB180 and ICB180-mCherry refers to the yeast diameter without its capsule and
was measured from 24-h YPD cultures using Fiji software32 after acquiring pictures
on Nikon TE2000-U live microscope equipped with Digital Sight camera (DS-Qi
1MC) and NIS elements AR software and ×100 oil immersion lens.
Isolation of cryptococcal capsule. Capsular purification was adapted from
Cherniak et al.33 and slightly modified as follows: R265 cells grew in 500 ml YPD
liquid culture at room temperature with continuous slow shaking (40 rpm). After
10 days growth, the culture was autoclaved (127 °C, 35 min) and cells were
removed via centrifugation (10,000 × g for 10 min), followed by filtering of the
supernatant through 0.45 μm membranes (GE Healthcare Life Sciences #7184-004)
to ensure only cell-free supernatant remained. Precipitation of the capsular poly-
saccharides from the supernatant was performed by adding three volumes of cold
ethanol followed by centrifugation to pellet the capsule (12,000 × g for 15 min). The
pellet was washed twice in cold ethanol and vacuum dried over night. Dried
capsule was kept at 4 °C and dissolved in PBS to the stock concentration of 1 mg ml
−1 which was kept at −20 °C.
Isolation and characterisation of EVs. Cryptococcal EVs were isolated by dif-
ferential centrifugation according to Rodrigues et al.13. Briefly, C. gattii cells were
grown in 30 ml YPD cultures for 48 h slowly shaking (50–100 rpm) at 25 °C, then
15 ml was transferred to 500 ml YPD cultures for 72 h vigorously shaking (180
rpm) at 25 °C. Supernatant was separated from cells in initial centrifugation at
4000 × g for 10–15 min and transferred to 250 ml vessels for the following two-step
centrifugation at 5000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C and subsequent 12,000 × g for 20 min
at 4 °C using rotor JLA 16.250 and Avanti JXN-26 high-speed centrifuge system
(Beckman Coulter). Obtained supernatants were transferred through Whatman
0.8 μm membranes (GE Healthcare Life Sciences #7188-004) using a vacuum pump
and later through 0.45 μm membranes (GE Healthcare Life Sciences #7184-004) or
gently through Acrodisc® Syringe Filters with Supor® Membrane (Pall Life #4654).
The resulting flow through was concentrated using Amicon-Ultra columns cut off
100 kDa (Millipore #UCF910008). Concentrated solutions were ultracentrifuged at
100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C using Optima ultracentrifuge XPN-80 and rotor 70 Ti
(Beckman Coulter). Pelleted vesicles were resuspended in 200 μl of filtered PBS or
filtered sterile water (for TEM) and checked by plating onto YPD agar for the
presence of live cells. EV preparations were tested for protein concentration using
Micro BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific #23235) and were stored at
−20 °C until further use. Particle diameter for each isolation was measured in
duplicates using the Particle Size Analyser Insight NanoSight (1450/118) and prism
NTA4000 LM10 Optical Flat (Malvern) with camera shutter 1495 and gain of 400.
Size distribution histograms were created using GraphPad Prism Software Inc.
Transmission electron microscope was performed as described previously34. Where
necessary, EVs were heat inactivated at 60 °C for 1 h.
Infection assays, transwells, IPR, phagocytic index. Macrophages (0.5–1.0×105
cells per ml) were seeded into a 24-well plate (Greiner) in a low-glucose (1000 mg l
−1) Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) supplemented with 2 mM L-
glutamine, 100 U ml−1 penicillin, 100 U ml−1 streptomycin and 10% foetal bovine
serum (FBS) at 37 °C and 5% CO2 and after 18–24 h they were activated for 1 h
with 150 ng ml−1 phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA; #P8139) in serum-free
DMEM (SF-DMEM). During that time 107 yeasts per ml were opsonised with 5%
PHS or 10 μg ml−1 MAb 18B7 for 1 h at room temperature. Phagocytes were
infected with opsonised cryptococci (0.5–1.0×106 cells per ml; MOI 10:1) for 2 h at
37 °C and 5% CO2. For co-infections with transwell filter system (Thincert, Greiner
Bio-One #662641) top compartment contained 0.5−1.0×106 opsonised yeasts
resuspended in 350 μl of SF-DMEM to the total volume of 400 μl. Transwells were
removed after 2 h of infections. After 2 h (T0) and following 24 h of infection (T24)
IPR measurements were performed as described previously6. Recovery of the
capsule by the acapsular strain R265ΔCap10 was performed at room temperature
for 1 h, where 0.5×106 cells were mixed with 12.5 μg of the capsule isolated from
R265.
Phagocytic index was scored microscopically within 2 h of infection as a
number of macrophages containing one or more cryptococci in the absence or in
the presence of 10 μg of EVs. Number of yeast cells phagocytosed by macrophages
was calculated as the number of individual ICB180 cells inside the infected
phagocytes within 2 h of infection, where budded but non-detached cells were
counted as single cells. For co-infection studies, R265_GFP67 and ICB180-mCherry
strains were used at a ratio of 1:1 and the concentration of 0.5×106 cells per ml and
the growth was performed in 48-well plates (Greiner) seeded with 0.5×105 cells per
ml macrophages as described above. After 2- or 24-h of infection brightfield and
fluorescent images were taken using Nikon TE2000-U live microscope with Digital
Sight camera (DS-Qi 1MC) and NIS elements AR software.
EV treatments. To remove proteins from the EVs, 50 μl of EVsR265 (at protein
concentration of around 6 mg ml−1) was gently mixed with proteinase K from
Tritirachium album (at final 100 μg ml−1 concentration; #P4850) and incubated
for 1.5 h at 37 °C. Proteinase K was then inactivated by addition of 1 mM
phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (#93482) and transferring the tube to room
temperature for 30 min. The reduction of protein levels after proteinase K treat-
ment was confirmed by running 10 μg of untreated and proteinase K-treated
EVsR265 on a 4–20% Mini-PROTEAN® TGX Stain-Free™ Protein Gel (Bio-Rad
#4568095) using PageRuler™ Plus Prestained Protein Ladder, 10−250 kDa (Thermo
Fisher Scientific #26619).
To remove lipids, 50 μl of EVsR265 (at protein concentration of around
6 mg ml−1) was incubated in the presence of 0.25% sodium deoxycholate
(resuspended in PBS) for 24 h at 4 °C. The reduction of lipids was confirmed by
staining detergent-treated EVsR265 with Vybrant DiI35 (see below).
To remove double-stranded DNA, 0.4 μl dsDNase (Thermo Fisher Scientific
#EN0771) was added to 20 μl (at protein concentration of around 6 mg ml−1)
EVsR265 for 15 min at 37 °C.
To degrade single-stranded DNA and RNA deprived of double-stranded
regions, 0.4 μl of S1 nuclease (Thermo Fisher Scientific #EN0321) was added to 20
μl EVsR265 for 30 min at room temperature.
To degrade RNA, 50 μl of EVsR265 (at protein concentration of around 6 mg ml
−1) was incubated in the presence of 2.5 μl RNase cocktail of RNase A and T1
(RNase Cocktail™ Enzyme Mix, Thermo Fisher Scientific #AM2286) for 15 min at
37 °C. Degradation of nucleic acids was confirmed by isolation of nucleic acids
from treated and untreated EVsR265 using Wizard Genomic DNA Purification Kit
(Promega) without RNase A added and visualising them on 1% agarose gel.
All treated EVs were used immediately in IPR studies or were stored at −20 °C
until further use.
Vybrant DiI staining and immunostaining. Cryptococci or infected macrophages
that were grown on 13 mm-diameter coverslips (VWr #631-0150) in 24-well plates
underwent fixation using pre-warmed 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room
temperature, washed in triplicate in warmed PBS and then treated with 50 mM
NH4Cl (Fluka) to quench fixation followed by three washes with PBS. After that cells
were treated with 0.1 or 1% Triton X-100 (in PBS) for 5 min at room temperature.
Wells were washed in PBS in triplicate and cells were blocked using goat serum
(#G9023) for 30–60 min at room temperature. Wells were washed in PBS in triplicate
and incubated with primary antibodies MAb 18B7 at the concentration 1:500 (20 μg
ml−1) for 30–60 min at room temperature. Wells were washed in PBS in triplicate
and incubated in dark with goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated with CF594 at the
concentration 1:500 (#SAB4600402) for 30–60 min at room temperature. Wells were
washed in PBS in triplicate and the coverslips were transferred onto poly-L-lysine
adhesive microscope slides (Grale HDS, Trajan Scientific) and mounted using
ProLong Gold Antifade Mountant (Thermo Fisher Scientific #P36934).
EVsR265 and detergent-treated EVsR265 were stained with 20 μM (final
concentration) of a fluorescent lipophilic dye 1,1′-Dioctadecyl-3,3,3′,3′-
Tetramethylindocarbocyanine Perchlorate (Vybrant DiI cell-labeling solution,
Molecular Probes) for 105 min at room temperature followed by 15 min at 37 °C.
Unbound dye was removed from the samples by washing twice in 14 ml PBS and
filtering the resuspended samples through Amicon columns with a cut off of 100
kDa. Labelled EVs were then incubated for 30 min with macrophages, washed three
times with warmed PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde as described above
and observed microscopically.
Inhibition of endocytosis. To inhibit endocytosis, cytochalasin (#C2618-200ul)
was used at the final concentration of 5 μM (in DMSO) and latrunculin A (Cal-
biochem #428026-50UG) at 2 μM. These inhibitors were added to macrophages 1 h
prior to addition of EVs. Methyl-β-cyclodextrin (#C4555-1G) at the final con-
centration of 5 mM (in PBS) was added to macrophages 30 min prior to adding the
EVs. After initial inhibition, macrophages were washed with warmed PBS and
incubated with 10 μg of EVs or 1–10 μg of capsule for 15 min in SF-DMEM.
Microscopy. Infected/immunostained macrophages were observed using Zeiss
Axio Observer equipped with a ORCA-Flash 4.0 camera and ×63 oil immersion
lens. Twenty-one z-stacks with 0.5 μm intervals were acquired at 150 ms exposure
time for red fluorescent signals (100% lamp intensity) and 100 ms exposure time
for GFP signals (20% lamp intensity). Maximum projections were performed using
Zeiss software or Fiji32. The mean or maximum pixel intensities of red fluorescent
signals derived from immunostained EVs were corrected for the adjacent back-
ground outside the macrophage, and additionally in co-localisation studies between
EVs and phagocytosed yeasts, for the adjacent background in the macrophage.
Statistical analysis. All statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism
software (GraphPad Software Inc.).
