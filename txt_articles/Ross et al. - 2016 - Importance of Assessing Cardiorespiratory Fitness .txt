CLINICAL STATEMENTS  
AND GUIDELINES
ABSTRACT: Mounting evidence has firmly established that low levels 
of cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) are associated with a high risk of 
cardiovascular disease, all-cause mortality, and mortality rates attributable 
to various cancers. A growing body of epidemiological and clinical evidence 
demonstrates not only that CRF is a potentially stronger predictor of 
mortality than established risk factors such as smoking, hypertension, 
high cholesterol, and type 2 diabetes mellitus, but that the addition of 
CRF to traditional risk factors significantly improves the reclassification 
of risk for adverse outcomes. The purpose of this statement is to review 
current knowledge related to the association between CRF and health 
outcomes, increase awareness of the added value of CRF to improve 
risk prediction, and suggest future directions in research. Although the 
statement is not intended to be a comprehensive review, critical references 
that address important advances in the field are highlighted. The underlying 
premise of this statement is that the addition of CRF for risk classification 
presents health professionals with unique opportunities to improve patient 
management and to encourage lifestyle-based strategies designed to 
reduce cardiovascular risk. These opportunities must be realized to 
optimize the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease and hence 
meet the American Heart Association’s 2020 goals.
M
ounting evidence over the past 3 decades has firmly established that low 
levels of cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) are associated with a high risk of car-
diovascular disease (CVD) and all-cause mortality, as well as mortality rates 
attributable to various cancers, especially of the breast and colon/digestive tract.1–4 
Importantly, improvements in CRF are associated with reduced mortality risk.5 Al-
though CRF is now recognized as an important marker of cardiovascular health, it is 
currently the only major risk factor not routinely assessed in clinical practice.
In 2013, the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology 
jointly released new guidelines for the prevention and treatment of coronary artery 
disease.6 Although CRF is the fourth-leading risk factor for CVD and has long been 
established as a significant prognostic marker,7 it was excluded from the risk calcula-
tor. The authors of the guidelines noted that the evidence that CRF would enhance 
risk classification was inconclusive, and thus, the added contribution of CRF to deter-
mine CVD risk was uncertain. There is, however, a large body of epidemiological and 
clinical evidence demonstrating not only that CRF is a potentially stronger predictor 
of mortality than established risk factors such as smoking, hypertension, high choles-
terol, and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), but that the addition of CRF to traditional 
risk factors significantly improves the reclassification of risk for adverse outcomes.

CRF AS A PREDICToR oF HEALTH oUTCoMES
CRF reflects the integrated ability to transport oxygen from 
the atmosphere to the mitochondria to perform physical 
work. It therefore quantifies the functional capacity of an 
individual and is dependent on a linked chain of processes 
that include pulmonary ventilation and diffusion, right and 
left ventricular function (both systole and diastole), ventric-
ular-arterial coupling, the ability of the vasculature to ac-
commodate and efficiently transport blood from the heart 
to precisely match oxygen requirements, and the ability 
of the muscle cells to receive and use the oxygen and nu-
trients delivered by the blood, as well as to communicate 
these metabolic demands to the cardiovascular control 
center. Clearly, CRF is directly related to the integrated 
function of numerous systems, and it is thus considered a 
reflection of total body health. About half of the variance 
in CRF is considered to be attributable to heritable fac-
tors9; similarly, the contribution of inherited factors to the 
response of CRF to physical activity approximates 45% 
to 50%.10 It is noteworthy that these heritability estimates 
are similar in magnitude to other CVD risk factors, includ-
ing, for example, insulin, glucose, lipoproteins, blood 
pressure, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein.11
CRF can be measured directly, expressed as maxi-
mal oxygen consumption (V

is more objective and precise, but because it is easier to 
obtain, estimated CRF derived from the peak work rate 
is the more common expression of fitness, particularly in 
epidemiological studies involving large populations. Nu-
merous studies have reported that both measured and 
estimated CRF strongly predict health outcomes; in the 
following overview of these studies, CRF refers to esti-
mated fitness unless otherwise stated.
oVERVIEw oF CRF AND HEALTH oUTCoMES
Since the late 1950s, numerous scientific reports have 
examined the separate relationships between physical 
activity, CRF, and all-cause mortality. The past 2 de-
cades in particular have seen an exponential growth 
in the number of studies assessing the association 
between measures of CRF, mortality, and other health 
outcomes.12–16 A consistent finding in these studies was 
that after adjustment for age and other risk factors, 
CRF was a strong and independent marker of risk for 
cardiovascular and all-cause mortality. This observation 
has been made in healthy men and women, those with 
suspected or known CVD, and those with comorbid con-
ditions, including obesity, T2DM, hypertension, and lipid 
abnormalities.12–23 In a growing number of studies, CRF 
has been demonstrated to be a more powerful predic-
tor of mortality risk than traditional risk factors such 
as hypertension, smoking, obesity, hyperlipidemia, and 
T2DM. In addition, CRF has been shown to be a more 
powerful predictor of risk than other exercise test vari-
ables, including ST-segment depression, symptoms, 
and hemodynamic responses.13,16,18,23–30 Moreover, nu-
merous recent studies have expressed CRF in the con-
text of survival benefit per metabolic equivalent (MET; a 
multiple of the resting metabolic rate approximating 3.5 
mL·kg−1·min−1); selected studies are presented in Table 
1. These studies are noteworthy in that each 1-MET 
higher CRF (a small increment achievable by most indi-
viduals) was associated with considerable (10%–25%) 
improvement in survival.
Although a variety of indirect estimates or surrogates 
for CRF have been associated with health outcomes dat-
ing back to the 1950s, Blair and colleagues2 published 
a seminal study in 1989 in which fitness was estimated 
using maximal treadmill testing in >13 
000 asymptom-
atic men and women. Participants were followed up for 
110 
482 person-years (averaging >8 years) for all-cause 
mortality. Key results from this analysis are presented 
in the Figure. Age-adjusted mortality rates were low-
est (18.6 per 10 
000 person-years) among the most fit 
and highest (64.0 per 10 
000 person-years) among the 
least fit men; the corresponding mortality rates among 
women were 8.5 and 39.5 per 10 
000 person-years, 
respectively. These findings closely parallel an earlier re-
port among asymptomatic men from the Lipid Research 
Clinics (LRC) Mortality Follow-up,39 in which each 2–stan-
dard deviation decrement in CRF (roughly 2–3 METs) was 
associated with a 2- to 5-fold higher coronary heart dis-
ease (CHD) or all-cause death rate. Numerous research 
groups worldwide have reported similar findings over the 
past 2 decades. These follow-up studies included sub-
jects with and without CVD, T2DM, obesity, and lipid ab-
normalities and of varying ethnicities, as well as women 
who were apparently healthy at the time of their fitness 
evaluation.14–30 Gulati et al23 suggested that the strength 
of exercise capacity in predicting risk of mortality was 
even greater among women than men, demonstrating a 
17% lower risk for every 1-MET increase in CRF. Similar-
ly, Nes et al38 reported a 21% lower risk for every 1-MET 
increase in CRF for both sexes in a large healthy popula-
tion followed up for an average of 24 years. Further-
more, in the LRC Mortality Follow-up trial, nearly 3000 
asymptomatic women underwent maximal exercise test-
ing and were followed up for up to 20 years.28 A 20% 
lower survival was observed for every 1-MET decrement 
in CRF. This study also highlighted the relative limitations

ASSoCIATIoN BETwEEN CRF AND HEALTH 
oUTCoMES
In recent years, the association between CRF and a wide 
range of health outcomes has also been addressed in 
varied populations, for example, patients referred for ex-
ercise testing for clinical reasons.16,18,19,22,25–27,40,41 In a 
study performed among US veterans, 6213 men under-
went maximal exercise testing for clinical reasons and 
were followed up for a mean of 6.2 years.18 Subjects 
were classified into 5 categories by quintiles of CRF. Af-
ter adjusting for age, the largest gains in survival were 
noted when comparing the lowest to the next lowest CRF 
groups. Among apparently healthy subjects and those 
with CVD, the least fit individuals (<5 and <6 METs for 
subjects with and without CVD, respectively) had >4-
fold increased risk of all-cause mortality compared with 
the most fit. Importantly, an individual’s CRF level was a 
stronger predictor of mortality than established risk fac-
tors such as smoking, hypertension, high cholesterol, 
and T2DM. Over the past several years, other cohorts, 
such as those from the Cleveland Clinic25,26,40 and the 
Mayo Clinic,29,41 as well as numerous ongoing follow-up 
trials in the United States and Europe,12,15,16,43,44 have 
documented the importance of CRF as a predictor of 
mortality among clinically referred populations. These 
clinically based studies confirm the early observations of 
Blair et al,2 Framingham,44 and the LRC Trial28,39 among 
asymptomatic populations, underscoring the fact that 
the CRF level has a strong inverse association with the 
incidence of all-cause mortality. The strength of the as-
sociation between CRF and mortality was further rein-
forced in a meta-analysis by Kodama et al.16 Data were 
extracted from 33 studies, including nearly 103 
000 par-
ticipants. Compared with subjects in the most fit tertile, 
those with low CRF had a 70% and 56% higher risk for all-
cause and cardiovascular mortality, respectively. Across 
all studies, 13% and 15% reductions in cardiovascular 
and all-cause mortality, respectively, were observed per 
1-MET increase in exercise capacity. This meta-analysis 
also confirmed the previous finding that the greatest 
mortality benefits occur when progressing from the least 
fit and the next least fit group; lesser improvements in 
health outcomes were noted when individuals in the mod-
erate- to high-fit groups were compared.
Many recent studies have also demonstrated that 
low CRF is a stronger predictor of risk for adverse 
cardiovascular outcomes than traditional risk factors, 
including lipid abnormalities, hypertension, insulin resis-
tance, obesity, and smoking.12,13,16–21,24 Despite these 
observations, the importance of CRF in the risk para-
digm has historically received less attention from health 
professionals and CVD specialists. Moreover, when an 
exercise test is performed, there has been the ten-
dency to focus on ischemic ST-segment displacement 
and the potential need for coronary revascularization 
without considering the prognostic value of CRF.24,29,30 
Reasons for the inverse association between CRF and 
mortality are not fully understood. Possible explanations 
include the fact that fitter people tend to have more 
cardioprotective cardiovascular risk profiles (mediated 
in part through higher activity levels), autonomic tone 
(potentially reducing arrhythmogenic risk), lower risk for 
thrombotic events, and improved indices of endothe-
lial function. Numerous studies have documented that 
biological mechanisms for disease are favorably influ-
enced by CRF. For example, in a cohort aged 20 to 90 
years (n=4631), in which directly measured CRF was 
determined, women and men below the sex-specific me-
dian for CRF (women <35.1 mL·kg−1·min−1; men <44.2 
mL·kg−1·min−1) were 5 and 8 times, respectively, more 
likely to have a cluster of cardiovascular risk factors 
than those in the highest quartile of CRF.45 Additionally, 
each 5- mL·kg−1·min−1 lower level of CRF corresponded 
to a 56% higher odds of cardiovascular risk factors. 
Similarly, Arsenault et al,46 in a cross-sectional evalua-
tion of 169 healthy men without T2DM, noted that those 
in the lowest tertile of CRF had higher triglyceride levels, 
higher apolipoprotein B, and higher total cholesterol/
high-density lipoprotein ratios than those in the highest 
tertile of CRF. Others have shown that higher CRF is 
associated with lower visceral adiposity, improved in-
sulin sensitivity, lower levels of inflammation, more fa-
vorable lipid and lipoprotein profiles, and lower blood 
pressure.20,46-48 Kawano et al48 performed a randomized 
trial of exercise training and dietary intervention in 217 
at-risk men and women and reported that lipid profiles 
improved with increases in CRF. Numerous recent stud-
ies have observed that C-reactive protein and other 
inflammatory markers are also lower among more fit 
individuals than among those who are less fit.15,47

CRF AND HEALTH oUTCoMES
The observations cited above highlight the fact that ex-
ceptionally high CRF levels are not necessary to provide 
significant health benefits. Individuals with a CRF level <5 
METs tend to have a particularly high risk for mortality, 
whereas many epidemiological studies have observed 
that CRF levels >8 to 10 METs are associated with rela-
tive protection.14,16,18–20,42 However, a consistent obser-
vation is that the largest benefits occur between the 
least fit and the next least fit group of individuals studied. 
Stated differently, health benefits are most apparent at 
the low end of the CRF continuum. Although studies vary, 
this is generally the case for both all-cause and CVD mor-

tality. This is an often misunderstood but important pub-
lic health message, because one need not be athletic 
to gain substantial health benefits from improvements in 
CRF. This is illustrated in the Figure, in which more than 
half the reduction in all-cause mortality occurs between 
the least fit group and the next least fit group. Relatively 
less is gained by increasing CRF between moderately fit 
and highly fit individuals. Moreover, evidence suggests 
that even among subjects within the low-fit49 or low-risk50 
groups, higher CRF is associated with reduced risk. This 
has implications for physical activity counselling, given 
that considerable benefits are likely to occur by encour-
aging the most sedentary or low-fit people to engage in 
modest activity levels. Simply stated, every effort should 
be undertaken to increase physical activity levels in sed-
entary adults (ie, some exercise is better than none). 
This might initially equate to increasing physical activity 
and exercise habits in previously sedentary individuals 
who continue to fall below current recommendations 
(guidelines). Over time, an individual can be “up-titrated,” 
approaching or exceeding the physical activity recom-
mendations. This pragmatic approach could serve to 
enhance compliance with increased physical activity and 
exercise training, because a sedentary person who has 
been accustomed to minimal levels of physical activity 
for decades might perceive the immediate adoption of 
an active lifestyle to the level of current recommenda-
tions as unattainable. When counselling sedentary peo-
ple, it is important to emphasize that substantive gains in 
health can be achieved with relatively modest increases 
in physical activity.
CRF AND CVD MoRTALITY IN ASYMPToMATIC 
PoPULATIoNS
Risk prediction in the general population is challeng-
ing, because most people are at low risk. Nes and col-
leagues38 found that CRF in healthy men (n=18 
348) and 
women (n=18 
764) <60 years of age at baseline was 
inversely associated with CVD mortality. Mean follow-up 
time was 24 years. Men <60 years of age at baseline 
and with a CRF below 85% of the age-expected value 
had an approximate 2-fold risk of dying of CVD com-
pared with those at or above the age-predicted value. 
For each 1-MET increase in exercise capacity, the risk 
of CVD mortality was 21% lower in both men and wom-
en. Women below 85% of the age-predicted CRF had a 
24% higher risk of CVD mortality. Similarly, Artero et al51 
evaluated 43 
356 adults (21% women) aged 20 to 84 
years who were free of baseline history of CVD or cancer 
and followed them up for a median of 14.5 years. Both 
measured and estimated CRF were inversely associated 
with risk for fatal and nonfatal CVD events in men and 
for nonfatal CVD events in women. The risk reduction 
per 1-MET increase in measured CRF was 17% for fatal 
CVD and 10% for nonfatal CVD in men and 5% for fatal 
CVD and 23% for nonfatal CVD in women. Comparable 
findings have been reported in ongoing follow-up stud-
ies from cohorts including the Veterans Exercise Test-
ing Study,17–19,22 the Aerobics Center Longitudinal Study 
(ACLS),2,5,13,20,51 and the Henry Ford Exercise Testing 
Project.52–54 Importantly, the overall discriminative ability 
of CRF in these studies is comparable to that normally 
obtained in widely used risk models, such as the Fram-
ingham risk score and European SCORE (Systematic 
Coronary Risk Evaluation) algorithm.55,56 For example, 
Laukkanen et al57 reported that a 1-MET increment in 
CRF and a 1% increment in European risk score were 
associated with 16% and 15% changes, respectively, in 
risk for all-cause mortality. Subjects with high European 
or Framingham score and low peak V
⋅
o2 represented the 
highest risk group.
Conclusions and Recommendations: CRF as a 
Predictor of Health outcomes
• CRF is as strong a predictor of mortality as estab-
lished risk factors such as cigarette smoking, 
hypertension, high cholesterol, and T2DM.
• A CRF level <5 METs in adults is associated with 
high risk for mortality; CRF levels >8 to 10 METs 
are associated with increased survival.
• More than half the reduction in all-cause mortality 
occurs between the least fit (eg, CRF <5 METs) 
group and the next least fit group (eg, CRF 5–7 
METs).
• The influence of race on the relationship between 
CRF and health outcomes requires further 
investigation.
• Small increases in CRF (eg, 1–2 METs) are associ-
ated with considerably (10% to 30%) lower adverse 
cardiovascular event rates.
• Efforts to improve CRF should become a standard 
part of clinical encounters (eg, an accepted “vital 
sign”).
CRF AS A PREDICToR oF oTHER CVD 
oUTCoMES
Beyond cardiovascular and all-cause mortality, habitual 
physical activity and CRF have been linked to both car-
diovascular and noncardiovascular surgical outcomes, 
including the timing of cardiac transplantation in ambula-
tory patients with heart failure (HF), their risk stratifica-
tion, and the likelihood of HF hospitalization in later life, 
as well as the incidence of stroke in older adults. The 
prognostic value of CRF, including peak V

o2, the ventila-
tory threshold, and other indices, has reinvigorated the 
clinical value of cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPX), 
which has been used less frequently in recent years in

favor of more advanced diagnostic imaging procedures 
(eg, exercise stress echocardiography, exercise myo-
cardial perfusion imaging, pharmacological testing).58 
This section reviews clinically relevant epidemiological 
and observational studies, with specific reference to 
possible biological mechanisms underlying these asso-
ciations, or the lack thereof.
CRF as a Preoperative Predictor of Surgical Risk
Recent studies suggest that in addition to being a strong 
predictor of cardiovascular and all-cause mortality in 
both asymptomatic and clinically referred populations, 
CRF could be especially helpful in the preoperative risk 
assessment of patients undergoing cardiovascular and 
noncardiovascular surgery,58 predicting surgical compli-
cations and short-term outcomes in patients subjected 
to abdominal aortic aneurysm repair,59–61 hepatic trans-
plantation,62,63 lung cancer resection,64 upper gastroin-
testinal surgery,65,66 intra-abdominal surgery,67,68 bariat-
ric surgery,69 and coronary artery bypass grafting.70 In 
addition, when patients with coronary artery disease 
who had to wait in the hospital for coronary artery by-
pass grafting were randomized into an exercise training 
group, outcomes were superior to those in the standard 
care group, because a reduced rate of postoperative 
complications and shorter hospital stays were observed 
(Table 2).71 Nine of the 12 studies reviewed sufficiently 
investigated the predictive value of preoperative CRF for 
postoperative complications, and 8 found CRF to be a 
valid outcome indicator. Fewer studies reported investi-
gating the role of the anaerobic or ventilatory threshold 
(a submaximal measure of CRF) in this regard, but in 
the 6 that did so adequately, 4 found it to be helpful 
in gauging surgical risk. Clearly, the level of preexisting 
comorbid conditions tolerated for surgery can affect the 
predictive value of directly measured CRF. Moreover, the 
weaker support for the lactate threshold as a predictor 
of short-term surgical outcomes might be a reflection of 
the submaximal nature of this variable or its indirect as-
sessment via concomitant ventilatory responses.58
There is no firmly identified causal mechanism in the 
literature that directly links a higher CRF or anaerobic 
threshold with reduced postoperative complications. One 
possible explanation is that fitter patients (eg, those with 
elevated CRF) are simply better able to cope with the aer-
obic and myocardial demands created by the trauma of 
major surgery. A lower level of CRF could be associated 
with greater numbers and greater severity of unhealthy 
comorbid conditions that individually or collectively could 
increase mortality. Another possible explanation is that 
a low CRF identifies a subset of patients who are more 
difficult to operate on, requiring longer operative and 
intubation times, or those characterized by a high-risk, 
proinflammatory state that could be related to the de-
velopment of heightened postoperative complications.69
CRF and HF
HF represents an increasingly important health problem 
because of the aging population, improved survival rate 
after acute CVD events, and the escalating costs attrib-
utable to the exacerbation of symptoms and associated 
serial hospitalizations, despite optimal medical therapy. 
CRF appears to have independent and additive value in 
the risk stratification of this escalating patient subset, 
as well as for the development of HF at later ages. In a 
20-year follow-up of >44 
000 men without a history of 
CVD, CRF was strongly and inversely associated with HF 
mortality, regardless of the number of HF risk factors 
present, with low CRF (unfit) and obesity serving as the 
strongest risk factors.49a
In a seminal report, Mancini et al72 used directly mea-
sured CRF, specifically peak V
⋅
o2, to clarify the optimal 
timing of heart transplantation in ambulatory patients 
with HF. Among those patients not accepted for heart 
transplantation, CRF >14 mL·kg−1·min−1 yielded compa-
rable survival to those who underwent transplantation. In 
contrast, CRF <10 mL·kg−1·min−1 yielded markedly lower 
survival. These data have had profound implications in 
assessing the timing of heart transplantation. Since this 
landmark report, newer studies have provided additional 
support for CPX as a primary assessment in patients with 
HF.73–76 CPX assessment in patients with HF has evolved 
to a multivariate model that incorporates aerobic capac-
ity, ventilatory efficiency, hemodynamics, heart rate (HR) 
and electrocardiogram, and subjective symptoms, which 
allows for a 3-dimensional perspective of CRF and im-
proved prognostic resolution. As an alternative approach 
when CPX is not feasible, Hsich et al77 sought to deter-
mine whether treadmill exercise time, a correlate of CRF, 
could be of value as an initial prognostic screening tool 
in patients with impaired systolic function (left ventricu-
lar ejection fraction <40%) for the prediction of all-cause 
mortality. During a mean follow-up of 5 years, 742 of 
2231 patients (33%) died. Using a modified Naughton 
treadmill protocol, for each 1-minute decrease in exer-
cise test duration, there was a 7% increased hazard of 
death. Interestingly, even among patients with an estimat-
ed CRF >14 mL·kg−1·min−1, that is, those classified as 
lower risk, a reduced treadmill exercise time was associ-
ated with markedly worse outcomes. These findings sug-
gest that the simple measurement of treadmill exercise 
time provides a valuable initial prognostic screening tool 
in patients with impaired left ventricular ejection fraction.
To clarify the effects of CRF on HF risk, researchers 
recently linked individual subject data from the ACLS with 
Medicare claims.78 The study population had a low prev-
alence of traditional risk factors and included 19 
485 
subjects (78.8% men) who received Medicare coverage 
over a 10-year span (1999–2009). Midlife CRF (at mean 
age 49 years) was estimated from the achieved Balke 
treadmill time, expressed as METs, and related to HF

hospitalizations after age 65 years. After adjustment for 
traditional risk factors, higher midlife CRF was associ-
ated with a lower risk for HF hospitalization. In fact, each 
1-MET higher level in midlife CRF was associated with 
a 17% lower risk for HF hospitalization in later life. Col-
lectively, these data suggest that the increased HF risks 
associated with low CRF could be favorably modified in 
midlife, irrespective of antecedent HF risks.
CRF and Risk of Stroke
Although cardiovascular and stroke prevention strate-
gies are commonly recommended for middle-aged and 
older adults, including aggressive risk factor modifica-
tion (eg, hypertension, T2DM, cholesterol) via lifestyle 
changes and pharmacotherapies, as well as efforts to 
reduce or eliminate cigarette smoking, alcohol con-
sumption, and obesity,79 limited data are available 
regarding the potential prophylactic role of CRF in re-
ducing the incidence of cerebrovascular events. Nev-
ertheless, according to a 10.9-year follow-up study of 
older men, there was a strong, inverse dose-response 
association between time spent walking and risk of 
stroke, independent of walking pace (intensity) and es-
tablished and novel risk factors.80
More than a decade ago, researchers examined the as-
sociation between CRF and stroke mortality in 16 
878 ap-
parently healthy men aged 40 to 87 years using the ACLS 
database.81 Each subject initially underwent a complete 
medical examination that included a peak or symptom-lim-
ited treadmill exercise test to volitional fatigue. Subjects 
were classified into 3 CRF groups (ie, low fit, moderate fit,

high fit), expressed as METs, based on the attained tread-
mill speed, grade, and duration. Over an average follow-
up of 10 years, men in the highest CRF group (13.1±1.4 
METs) had a 68% lower risk of stroke death than men 
who were in the lowest CRF group (8.5±1.0 METs). How-
ever, men in the moderate CRF group (10.5±1.0 METs) 
had nearly the same stroke mortality, corresponding to 
a 63% lower risk. The inverse association between CRF 
and stroke mortality remained after adjustment for poten-
tial confounding variables, including cigarette smoking, 
alcohol consumption, overweight/obesity, hypertension, 
T2DM, and family history of CVD. These findings, like 
those for CHD, suggest an “asymptote of gain” beyond 
which further improvements in CRF were associated with 
little or no additional stroke survival benefit.
Collectively, these data, primarily derived from epi-
demiological and observational studies, suggest that 
interventions aimed at reducing the morbidity and mor-
tality associated with stroke should consider efforts to 
improve CRF in middle-aged and older adults. Neverthe-
less, additional clinical trials and supporting biological 
plausibility data are needed before we can unequivocally 
state that these cardioprotective associations truly imply 
causation.
Conclusions: CRF as a Predictor of other CVD 
outcomes
• CRF strongly predicts outcomes across a wide 
spectrum of CVD outcomes, including those related 
to stroke, HF, and surgery.
• Optimizing CRF prior to surgical interventions 
(termed 
“prehabilitation”) 
improves 
outcomes 
including surgical risk, mortality, and function in the 
postsurgical period.
APPLICATIoN oF CRF To RECLASSIFICATIoN 
oF CARDIoVASCULAR RISK
Numerous studies have reported that adding CRF to 
a single or several established risk factors for CVD 
substantially improves the precision of risk prediction 
for CVD morbidity or mortality.8,12–19,82–84 However, al-
though the evidence that CRF is inversely associated 
with mortality is strong and convincing, it does not 
necessarily mean that CRF directly enhances CVD mor-
tality risk prediction. For CRF to truly be a novel risk 
marker, it must improve risk prediction beyond tradi-
tional markers.85 There exists no single statistical test 
that provides all the information necessary to evaluate 
a new biomarker, and a combination of ≥2 statistical 
approaches has been suggested.85–89 Recent studies 
suggest that the net reclassification improvement (NRI) 
and the integrated discrimination improvement can 
provide important insights beyond traditional statistical 
tools (eg, hazard ratios, odds ratios, C-index) when es-
timating risk for adverse outcomes. These tools more 
directly address the extent to which a given risk marker 
adds to existing markers to predict adverse outcomes. 
NRI indicates whether the addition of a biomarker cor-
rectly and significantly alters risk classification; it is 
defined as the net change in risk among those who 
do and do not experience an event.86,88 Integrated dis-
crimination improvement determines whether the addi-
tion of a new biomarker significantly improves risk dis-
crimination, reflecting the improvement in true-positive 
rates minus the worsening of false-positive rates.86–89 
Several recent studies have used these metrics to help 
determine the additive value of CRF to traditional risk 
markers (Table 3).
Wickramasinghe et al95 reported that the addition 
of CRF to a traditional risk prediction model (including 
age, body mass index, systolic blood pressure, T2DM, 
total cholesterol, and smoking) improved 30-year risk 
prediction in 13 
627 men and 2906 women without 
known CVD at baseline. A low level of CRF (defined as 
an estimated peak V
⋅
o2 <28 mL·kg−1·min−1 for men and 
<21 mL·kg−1·min−1 for women) was associated with a 
greater 30-year risk of dying of CVD in all risk factor 
strata. Importantly, CRF in particular added to long-term 
risk prediction. For example, a significantly higher 30-
year risk for CVD mortality was noted among people with 
hypertension (stage II) and low versus high CRF (18.4% 
versus 10.1%) despite a similar risk at 10-year follow-up 
(2.3% versus 1.2 %). Laukkanen et al57 studied a random 
population-based sample of 1639 men without known 
T2DM or atherosclerotic CVD at baseline. During the 16-
year follow-up period, those with high Framingham or Eu-
ropean risk scores and low CRF represented the group 
at highest risk of death of CVD and all causes. These 
results clearly demonstrated that the addition of CRF to 
established risk scores further improved risk prediction.
Gupta et al91 evaluated whether CRF improved risk 
classification when added to traditional risk factors in 
49 
307 men and 17 
064 women examined in the ACLS 
between 1970 and 2006. Their traditional risk fac-
tor model included age, sex, systolic blood pressure, 
T2DM, total cholesterol, and smoking. Risk estimates 
were evaluated with and without CRF after 10 and 25 
years of follow-up in men and after 25 years in women. 
In men, at 10 and 25 years of follow-up, the addition 
of CRF to the traditional risk model resulted in NRIs for 
CVD mortality of 12.1% and 4.1%, respectively. This 
suggests that 12.1% and 4.1% of subjects were cor-
rectly reclassified for CVD mortality beyond traditional 
risk factors at these time points. The corresponding 
relative integrated discrimination improvements were 
29% and 11.1% at 10 and 25 years. The addition of 
CRF to the traditional risk model in women resulted in 
an NRI of 13.1% and relative integrated discrimination 
improvement of 13.5% at the 25-year follow-up, where-

650 men aged 35 
to 70 years who took part in health surveys in Eng-
land and Scotland between 1994 and 2003. During a 
mean follow-up of 9 years, NRIs for CVD mortality were 
27.2% and 21.0% for men and women, respectively. 
Myers et al92 followed up ≈7000 men referred for exer-
cise testing for clinical reasons for a mean of 10 years 
and observed that the addition of CRF to a model that 
included traditional risk factors resulted in an NRI of 
42.8%. Holtermann et al94 reported an NRI of 30.5% 
for CVD mortality and an NRI of 24.5% by adding self-
reported CRF to traditional risk factors among 8936 
men and women in the Copenhagen City Heart Study.
APPLICATIoN oF CRF To RISK PREDICTIoN 
MoDELS
Despite the aforementioned evidence linking CRF to lon-
gevity, it is not included in any of the currently used CVD 
risk prediction models from health authorities or health 
organizations throughout the world. A principal argument 
against the use of CRF in CVD risk-score models could be 
its precise quantification or the lack of evidence from ran-
domized clinical trials, which would need to include all age 
groups and both sexes and use hard end points such as 
CVD morbidity and mortality. Although this limitation also 
applies to cigarette smoking, few people would dispute 
that smoking increases CVD risk. Nevertheless, data from 
large population-based studies and small-scale random-
ized clinical trials in selected populations suggest that CRF 
should be included in future CVD risk prediction models.
Numerous studies have assessed CRF in the context 
of established risk prediction models such as the Fram-
ingham risk score. Gander96 examined the association of 
CRF with 10-year risk of CHD while controlling for Fram-
ingham risk score in 29 
854 men from the ACLS who 
were examined between 1979 and 2002. At baseline, 
all participants were free of CVD or cancer and between 
30 and 74 years of age. Men who developed CHD dur-
ing the follow-up were older and had an estimated CRF 
≤38 mL·kg−1·min−1. Risk of CHD was 20% lower for each 
1-MET-higher increment in CRF. In addition, being catego-
rized as having a high CRF (defined as the highest 40% 
of CRF in the entire ACLS population [mean CRF 48±7 
mL·kg−1·min−1]) was associated with a 33% lower risk 
compared with men who had low CRF (defined as the 
lowest 20%; mean CRF 30±4 mL·kg−1·min−1). The study 
also stratified subjects into low, moderate, or high Fram-

Conclusions: Application of CRF to Risk 
Prediction Models
• The addition of CRF to traditional risk factors signifi-
cantly improves reclassification of risk for adverse 
health outcomes.
• Traditional risk scores (such as Framingham risk 
score) are enhanced by adding CRF.
SERIAL CHANGES IN CRF AND RISK 
PREDICTIoN
The impact of CRF as a biomarker is valuable not only 
to determine a person’s risk for future adverse clinical 
outcomes, but also to optimize treatment strategies. 
Determining CRF on a serial basis is valuable in gaug-
ing the effectiveness of treatment strategies, including 
recommendations for participation in physical activity. 
Blair et al31 studied 9777 men given 2 preventive medi-
cal examinations, each of which included assessment 
of CRF by maximal exercise testing, a mean of 5.1 
years apart. The highest age-adjusted all-cause death 
rate was observed in men who were unfit at both exam-
inations (122.0/10 
000 man-years); the lowest death 
rate was observed in those who were physically fit at 
both examinations (39.6/10 
000 man-years). Men who 
improved from unfit to fit between the first and second 
examination had a reduction in mortality risk of 44% rel-
ative to men who remained unfit at both examinations. 
Lee et al97 reported that in relatively fit men (n=14 345, 
average estimated CRF 41.7 mL·kg−1·min−1), maintain-
ing or improving CRF from baseline to a second ex-
amination 6 years later was associated with 27% and 
42% reduced risks for CVD and all-cause mortality, re-
spectively, during an 11.4-year follow-up period com-
pared with those whose CRF decreased over the same 
period. Importantly, men who had a reduction in CRF 
between examinations were at increased risk of dying 
of CVD regardless of changes in body mass index. Ev-
ery 1-MET increase in CRF was associated with a 19% 
lower risk of CVD mortality. Similarly, Kokkinos et al98 
reported that unfit individuals whose CRF improved had 
a 35% lower mortality risk during a median follow-up 
period of 8.1 years compared with those who remained 
unfit. The largest randomized trial of exercise training 
in HF patients, HF-ACTION (Heart Failure and a Con-
trolled Trial Investigating Outcomes of Exercise Train-
ing), reported that every 6% increase in CRF (measured 
peak V
⋅
o2) over 3 months was associated with a 4% 
lower risk of cardiovascular mortality or cardiovascular 
hospitalization and an 8% lower risk of cardiovascular 
mortality or HF hospitalization after adjustment for po-
tential confounding variables.99
Conclusions: Serial Changes in CRF and Risk 
Prediction
• CRF is a variable that is responsive to therapy, and 
serial measures of CRF are valuable in risk strati-
fication. Individuals whose CRF increases between 
examinations have a lower risk of adverse health 
and clinical outcomes than those whose CRF 
decreases, and this should be communicated to 
patients.
EMERGING RoLE oF CRF AND ITS 
ASSoCIATIoN wITH oTHER HEALTH 
oUTCoMES
Although is it well documented that higher levels of CRF 
are associated with lower CVD risk, over the past 2 de-
cades numerous other health benefits have been linked 
to higher levels of CRF.
CRF, Dementia, Alzheimer Disease, and 
Psychological Stress
Several studies have linked higher levels of CRF to a 
reduced risk of developing both dementia and Alzheimer 
disease.100–103 Defina et al100 reported that people in the 
highest quartile of CRF had a 36% lower risk of develop-
ing dementia than those in the lowest quartile. Although 
the mechanisms whereby the brain is favorably impacted 
by regular exercise or increased CRF are incompletely 
understood, several have been suggested.101–117 Higher 
levels of CRF are associated with lower measures of 
anxiety and symptoms of depression.118,119 In addition, 
regular exercise has been shown to reduce symptoms 
of anxiety and depression,120,121 whereas in subjects who 
survived a suicide attempt, mountain hiking appeared to 
confer modest improvements in hopelessness, depres-
sion, and suicide ideation.122,123
CRF and Prediabetes, T2DM, and Metabolic 
Syndrome
Skeletal muscle is the largest consumer of glucose with-
in the human body. When it is functioning properly, more 
glucose is removed from the blood for a given amount 
of insulin. This not only helps maintain normal levels of 
blood glucose but spares the pancreas from having to 
overproduce insulin. Numerous studies have reported in-
verse associations between CRF and the risk of develop-
ing prediabetes, metabolic syndrome, and T2DM.124–128
Similar to the dose-response relation observed between 
CRF and CVD (Figure), the CRF-T2DM association is cur-

vilinear in nature.124,125 Among people with moderate to 
high levels of CRF, there are only small differences in rates 
of T2DM between each CRF level. However, in the lower 
range of CRF, small increments are associated with large 
differences in T2DM risk. Thus, the lowest levels of CRF 
are associated with disproportionate levels of risk. Similar-
shaped CRF risk curves are found for metabolic syndrome 
and markers of inflammation.126,128–132 These findings re-
inforce the observation that physical activity interventions 
targeting the least fit individuals have the largest benefit.
The view that CRF represents more than simply physi-
cal activity habits when evaluating metabolic risk has 
been supported by a series of reports using specially 
trained rats. To examine the relation between intrinsic 
CRF and metabolic health, Britton and colleagues133–135 
bred rats for either low or high running capacity. Low-
CRF rats had higher blood pressures, visceral adiposity, 
fasting glucose, insulin, triglycerides, and free fatty acid 
levels. In contrast, highly fit rats had considerably higher 
levels of CRF, skeletal muscle oxidative enzyme capac-
ity, and proteins such as PGC-1α, known to be integral 
to mitochondrial content and function.133–135 The investi-
gators suggested that these “observations support the 
notion that impaired regulation of oxidative pathways in 
mitochondria may be the common factor linking reduced 
CRF to cardiovascular and metabolic risk.”
CRF and Cancer
Higher levels of CRF are associated with a lower risk 
of developing certain cancers, including lung and breast 
cancer and cancers of the gastrointestinal system.136–141 
A recent meta-analysis141 reported 20% and 45% low-
er risk of all-cause cancer mortality in moderately and 
highly fit people, respectively, than in the low-CRF group, 
irrespective of adiposity. Although the mechanisms by 
which regular moderate to vigorous physical activity, a 
strong determinant of CRF, might influence malignant 
cell growth is not clear, associated interactions between 
adiposity, immune, and endocrine function could serve 
to suppress cancer development. Possible underlying 
mechanisms include decreased gastrointestinal transit 
time, improved immune function and insulin sensitivity, 
alterations in insulin-like growth factors and other modu-
lating hormones (eg, leptin), favorable changes in body 
composition, and combinations thereof.
CRF and Disability
Lower levels of CRF are associated with a higher risk of 
disability later in life.142 Interestingly, a recent substudy 
of the Look AHEAD (Look AHEAD: Action for Health in Di-
abetes) behavioral intervention trial focused on disability 
and found that after 4 years, improvements in CRF were 
associated with a reduced risk of developing disability 
among obese adults with T2DM.143
Conclusions: CRF and Its Association with other 
Health outcomes
• Higher levels of CRF are associated with a reduced 
risk of adverse health outcomes and chronic dis-
eases in addition to CVD.
• A disproportionately high reduction in adverse health 
outcomes and cardiovascular risk factors occurs 
between the least fit and the next least fit cohorts.
• Physical activity interventions targeting the least fit 
individuals will likely have the largest health benefit.
MEASUREMENT oF CRF IN CLINICAL 
SETTINGS
Maximal Exercise Testing with CPX 
Measurements
CPX combines conventional exercise testing procedures 
with ventilatory expired gas analysis, which allows for the 
concomitant assessment of 3 prognostic/functional pa-
rameters: (1) V
⋅
o2; (2) carbon dioxide production (V
⋅
co2); 
and (3) minute ventilation (V
⋅
e). Detailed CPX methodolo-
gy, which has several distinct advantages over other ap-
proaches to CRF assessment in terms of diagnosis, mea-
surements, and procedures, is provided elsewhere.74,75 
Specifically, the additional information obtained from 
CPX allows for the most accurate and standardized 
quantification of CRF. A primary advantage is the direct 
measurement versus the estimation of peak/maximal 
 
V
⋅
o2. Technically, peak V
⋅
o2 implies no plateau in V
⋅
o2 with 
increasing exercise workloads, whereas maximal V
⋅
o2 im-
plies such a plateau.74 The term peak is commonly used 
in patient populations in which a plateau is not frequently 
observed; in contrast, maximal is the descriptor used in 
apparently healthy people. Peak/maximal V
⋅
o2 values vary 
widely and are influenced by age, sex, genetics, lifestyle/
exercise training habits, and varied disease states.144 
Values can range from <10 mL O2·kg−1·min−1 in patients 
with advanced chronic disease, such as end-stage HF,

clear advantage over estimated maximal HR, often de-
rived from the frequently used equation 220–age,144,146 
because the latter has a large population standard de-
viation (±12 bpm) and thus is not an ideal indicator of 
exercise effort. It has also been shown that CRF levels 
influence the decline in maximal HR with age.148

the peak V

co2 slope, as well as selected 
respiratory measures obtained from CPX, provide both 
prognostic and functional indices that are responsive 
to numerous therapeutic interventions.75,149 In addition, 
most commercially available CPX units have pulmonary 
function testing capabilities, which allow for the simul-
taneous diagnosis of certain respiratory limitations to 
exercise (eg, exercise-induced bronchospasm).74
The performance of CPX in patients with dyspnea on 
exertion of unknown origin and those diagnosed with HF 
has been a clinical standard of care for >10 years.74,75 
In patients with unexplained dyspnea, the independent 
and additive variables obtained from CPX often allow 
for the determination of likely underlying mechanisms 
for exercise intolerance or abnormal exertional symp-
toms, or at least are helpful in narrowing the potential 
causes.74 For example, a normal pulmonary function test 
at baseline with the development of an obstructive pat-
tern after CPX is a clear indication of exercise-induced 
bronchospasm. Conversely, an abnormally elevated

Patients with HF who have a ventilatory and Weber class

low risk for adverse events. Conversely, those with a 
ventilatory and Weber class of IV and D, respectively, 
are classified as being at extremely high risk for ad-
verse events and as appropriate candidates for cardiac 
transplantation based on CPX normative data. There is 
mounting evidence that peak V

based, and condition-specific description of related CPX

From a technical perspective, the routine use of CPX 
to determine CRF in selected patient populations has be-
come increasingly accepted.152 Factors that were once 
considered barriers, such as the rationale for CPX, costs 
associated with equipment, and the need for profession-
als with advanced training, are less problematic.74 A ma-
jor hurdle to performing CPX in the clinical setting was 
cleared with the recent recommendation that most maxi-
mal exercise tests can be supervised by appropriately 
trained nonphysician health professionals.153 In many pa-
tient populations, considerable evidence now indicates 
that the added value of the unique clinical information 
obtained by CPX is clearly justified.74,75

parameters, including the V

become primary clinical measures in many patient

• Although CPX involves higher levels of training and

many patients the independent and additive infor-
mation obtained justifies its use.
• The use of CPX for direct determination of CRF has 
become more feasible.

CLINICAL STATEMENTS  
AND GUIDELINES
testing is typically obtained from the achieved treadmill 
speed/grade and duration or the peak attained cycle er-
gometer workload (watts); CRF is then estimated by use 
of established prediction equations that convert the high-
est workload attained to exercise time, for some stan-
dardized protocols. Although estimating CRF from stan-
dardized exercise test protocols is quite common, only a 
few studies have established these prediction equations. 
Examples of equations from some commonly used pro-
tocols are shown in Table 5. Many of the early studies 
with the incremental Bruce,154 Balke,155 and modified 
Balke156 treadmill protocols had relatively small sample 
sizes. The Ball State University Bruce ramp equation157 
was developed from a slightly larger group of 698 appar-
ently healthy men and women.
There is inherent error in using these prediction equa-
tions, particularly when the protocol selected for exer-
cise testing is too aggressive given an unfit person’s 
limited physiological capacity (eg, Bruce protocol in a 
patient with HF). Myers et al159 evaluated the protocol 
used to predict CRF from peak work rate in 41 men dur-
ing an individualized ramp protocol, demonstrating a 
significant reduction in prediction error compared with 
conventional, more aggressive incremental exercise 
test protocols (Table 5). Another critical limiting factor 
for estimating peak V
⋅
o2 from treadmill protocols, either 
from test time or peak work rate, is the common prac-
tice of allowing patients to hold handrails while walking/
running. This practice allows subjects to extend time 
on the treadmill and potentially achieve a higher work 
rate,160 but with increased prediction error. McConnell 
et al158 developed a regression equation to predict CRF 
(Table 5) using the Bruce treadmill protocol in 128 men 
who were allowed handrail support, but not gripping. In 
summary, selection of a protocol that best matches a 
person’s physiological or functional capacity (eg, Bruce 
for athletes and Ramp for HF) while minimizing handrail 
use during treadmill testing can significantly reduce the 
error in predicting CRF.
Conclusions: Maximal Exercise Testing Without CPX 
Measurements
• For many patients, CPX is not readily available, 
and CRF can be estimated based on the attained 
treadmill speed, grade, and duration or the cycle 
ergometer workload, expressed as watts, from 
standardized protocols.
• Importantly, when CRF is estimated using a treadmill 
protocol, tests should be performed without allow-
ing patients to hold the handrails; resting hands on 
the handrails without gripping may be acceptable.
• Care should be taken to select a protocol that opti-
mally matches a person’s exercise or functional 
capacity.
Submaximal Exercise Testing without CPX 
Measurements
Submaximal exercise tests can be performed on cycle 
ergometers or treadmills, with estimations of CRF from 
the relation between the incremental HR response and 
work rate. Typically, 2 submaximal work rates are per-
formed, with measures of steady-state HR being record-
ed after ≈3 minutes at a fixed submaximal work rate. 
Ideally, the HR should exceed 110 bpm at each of the 2 
work rates, to eliminate the possible influence of other 
non–exercise-related factors that could stimulate HR 
at lower levels of exertion.161 A regression equation to 
estimate CRF is generated from the work rate and as-
sociated HR relation to predict the maximal work rate 
corresponding to age-predicted maximal HR. This meth-
od cannot be applied with patients using HR-modulating 
medications (eg, β-blockers). The major sources of er-
ror are the relatively high standard error of the estimate

and mechanical efficiency differences at given work 
rates between individuals.
Although these tests can be performed with little risk 
to the subject, the usefulness of the prediction of CRF 
must be considered in regard to the relatively larger 
SEE, typically in the range of ±10% to 15%.164,165
Field and Clinic Tests
There are numerous exercise-related tests to predict CRF 
that can be applied in either a clinical or fitness setting. 
Two running versions, the maximal distance covered in 
12 minutes or the time to complete 1.5 miles, have long 
been used by the military and in school settings to esti-
mate CRF.61 A potential safety concern associated with 
these tests is that they require maximal or near-maximal 
effort. A modification designed to limit the exercise inten-
sity, and thus make it more widely applicable, is the 1-mile 
walk test.166 To improve the prediction of CRF beyond that 
of test time, the regression equation also included sex, 
age, body weight, and peak HR in the study population 
(343 people aged 30 to 69 years).166 The advantages 
of these running and walking tests are that they require 
minimal resources (measured course, timing device, and 
palpated pulse rate) and can be self-administered.
In clinical settings with patients who are markedly 
deconditioned (eg, chronic obstructive pulmonary dis-
ease and HF), a common method to estimate CRF is the 
6-minute walk test for distance (6MWT).167 Some inves-
tigators have reported that patients who perform poorly 
on the 6MWT have a poorer prognosis.168 Additionally, 
the 6MWT may be able to detect differences attributable 
to therapy, especially in cardiac rehabilitation programs. 
However, the 6MWT may not necessarily provide an ac-
curate estimation of CRF, which limits its usefulness as 
an indicator of CRF.169 Others, however, have shown that 
the simple 6MWT in outpatients with stable CHD pro-
vided a reasonable estimate of CRF and was similar to 
treadmill exercise capacity in predicting cardiovascular 
events over a median follow-up of 8.0 years.170
Conclusions: Submaximal Exercise Testing Without CPX 
Measurements
• Other performance tests, including submaximal 
exercise test protocols and the 6MWT, can provide 
valuable information in clinical practice and should 
be considered when resources are limited. However, 
these assessments are not as precise as peak or 
symptom-limited exercise testing in quantitating CRF.

ESTIMATING CRF
Non–exercise-based equations or models are available 
to conveniently estimate CRF without performing a maxi-
mal or submaximal exercise test.171 This approach uses 
variables commonly assessed in clinical settings to pro-
vide a rapid and inexpensive way of estimating CRF in 
public health and clinical settings.
One of the first nonexercise prediction equations was 
developed by Jackson et al172 in 1990 using 1393 male 
and 150 female employees from the National Aeronautics 
and Space Administration (NASA)/Johnson Space Center, 
aged 20 to 70 years. Regression models were used to es-
timate CRF from age, sex, body mass index or percentage 
body fat, and self-reported physical activity, with an SEE of 
≈5.5 mL·kg−1·min−1.172 This equation has been cross-vali-
dated with independent samples173–176 and used to link es-
timated CRF with disease outcomes.177,178 Other research-
ers have developed nonexercise equations to estimate CRF 
in populations that differed in age, sex, and ethnicity. The 
accuracy of the predicted CRF values was improved by 
incorporating other lifestyle and health indicators.
One systematic review171 of 13 nonexercise equa-
tions is presented in Table 6.172,179–190 These equations 
were developed with cross-sectional data using age, sex, 
body weight (or body mass index, percentage of body 
fat, waist circumference), physical activity/exercise/
training (self-reported or measured), smoking, resting 
HR, or perceived functional ability as predictors of CRF. 
The R2 and SEEs ranged from 0.50 to 0.86 and 2.98 to 
6.90 mL·kg−1·min−1, respectively. The nonexercise CRF 
estimates were similar in accuracy to submaximal exer-
cise prediction models.172,174,181,191 A limitation of these 
equations is that they tend to underestimate and overes-
timate CRF at the upper and lower ends of the distribu-
tion, respectively.172,179,180,182,185,190 The underestimation 
is unlikely to affect highly fit individuals, who will still be 
correctly classified into the higher CRF categories; how-
ever, the overestimation for people with low CRF could 
be a concern because of the associated heightened risk 
among these men and women.38,172,182,192 Despite this, 
most models derived from large studies correctly classify 
individuals into low-fitness categories. For example, in a 
study by Nes et al190 that included 2067 men and 2193 
women, 90.2% of women and 92.5% of men in the 2 
lowest quartiles of fitness were correctly classified into 1 
of the 2 lowest measured quartiles when using their CRF 
prediction algorithm. That study also correctly classified 
a high percentage of men (93.6%) and women (91.2%) 
within the closest measured “high-fit” quartile.
One group who developed nonexercise equations 
using objective measures of physical activity reported 
more accurate prediction of CRF in Japanese men and 
women than with more traditional models using self-re-
ported physical activity.187–189 More recently, a new longi-
tudinal nonexercise algorithm has been developed using 
data from the ACLS that addressed 2 limitations from 
previous cross-sectional studies.191 First, the longitudi-
nal equations used quadratic modeling to account for 
the well-documented nonlinear relationship between age 
and CRF. Second, the longitudinal nonexercise models

Nevertheless, this longitudinal equation191 should be 
cross-validated in other populations.
Conclusions and Recommendations: Nonexercise 
Prediction Equations for Estimating CRF
• While avoiding the costs and and modest risk asso-
ciated with exercise testing, nonexercise algorithms 
using readily available clinical variables may provide 
reasonably accurate estimates of CRF.
• Nonexercise estimated CRF should not be viewed 
as an alternative for objective assessment of CRF, 
especially in some at-risk patient populations.

validity of nonexercise estimated CRF and long-term 
health risk, including mortality.38,51,90,193 Pooled data from 
8 British cohorts included 32 
319 people aged 35 to 70 
years, with a 9-year follow-up.90 In this study, the 2005 
nonexercise model proposed by Jurca et al185 was used 
to estimate CRF. A 9.4% and 7.4% lower risk of all-cause 
death and a 15.6% and 16.9% lower risk of CVD death 
per 1-MET increase was observed in men and women, 
respectively. Nes et al38 examined the predictive valid-
ity of nonexercise CRF using a cross-sectional model

derived previously.190 The sample included 37 
112 indi-
viduals who were followed up for a mean of 24 years in 
the HUNT study (Nord-Trøndelag Health Study). After ad-
justment for potential confounders, each 1-MET higher 
CRF was associated with 21% lower CVD mortality for 
both men and women who were <60 years of age at 
baseline, and the corresponding lower risks for all-cause 
mortality were 15% for men and 8% for women. Artero 
et al51 investigated the association between nonexercise 
estimated CRF using a longitudinal 2012 model191 that 
examined all-cause mortality and nonfatal CVD events 
among 43 
356 adults (21% women, aged 20–84 years) 
from the ACLS. With a median follow-up of 14.5 years, 
estimated CRF among men was associated with a 15% 
and 13% lower risk of all-cause death and nonfatal CVD 
events per MET, whereas in women the values were 11% 
and 13%, respectively. Martinez-Gomez et al193 also ex-
plored the impact of this new longitudinal model191 on 
all-cause mortality among 2930 adults >60 years of age 
during an average follow-up of 9.4 years. The investiga-
tors reported a 20% lower risk of death with each 1-MET 
increment only in older women. The aforementioned 
studies demonstrate that the risk reduction associated 
with each 1 MET increase in nonexercise estimated CRF 
ranges from 7.4% to 21% and from 8% to 16.9% for all-
cause mortality and CVD mortality, respectively. These 
results are consistent with the risk reduction as reported 
from a meta-analysis of 33 studies (13% and 15% for 
all-cause and CVD mortality, respectively).16
In summary, nonexercise estimated CRF provides an 
alternative approach for large epidemiological research 
and routine clinical practice with the goal to identify in-
dividuals with low CRF who are at increased health risk. 
Researchers or practitioners should select the equations 
that are most suitable for the population being evaluat-
ed. The 13 nonexercise equations given in Table 6 have 
all been cross-validated. Among these equations, the 
estimated CRF values in the 2005 model developed by 
Jurca et al185 and the 2011 model developed by Nes 
et al190 predicted long-term mortality90,98 and showed a 
comparable risk reduction to measured CRF.16 A step-
by-step procedure for using the Nes equation190 to esti-
mate CRF with routine clinical measures can be readily 
accessed by both the practitioner and the patient.194 Es-
timation of CRF provides the practitioner with a platform 
for counselling the patient regarding the importance of 
physical activity. However, in most clinical patient sub-
sets, nonexercise estimated CRF should not be viewed 
as a replacement for objective assessment of CRF.
Conclusions and Recommendations: Nonexercise 
CRF and CVD
• Nonexercise estimates of CRF may be useful to pro-
vide an initial estimate of one’s CRF, particularly to iden-
tify those at increased risk of CVD because of low CRF.
• In most clinical patient subsets, nonexercise esti-
mated CRF should not be viewed as a replacement 
for objective assessment of CRF.
ASSIGNING CRF VALUES ACCoRDING To AGE 
AND SEX
For a given age, men generally demonstrate higher CRF 
levels than women, which is largely attributed to their 
higher peak cardiac output, hemoglobin levels, and skel-
etal muscle mass.195,196 Also, a recent report showed 
those with moderate or high CRF had blunted age-related 
declines in maximal HR.148 Although it is widely accepted 
that CRF decreases with age, the rate and causes of the 
decrease in aerobic capacity remain poorly understood. 
Using men (n=435) and women (n=375) from the Balti-
more Longitudinal Study of Aging, researchers found a 
decline in peak V
⋅
o2 of 3% to 6% per decade for the third 
and fourth decades, but after age 70, the rate accelerat-
ed to >20% per decade.196 Using the much larger ACLS 
data set (3429 women and 16 
889 men), others have 
confirmed that the longitudinal decline in CRF of women 
and men is not linear, noting an increase in the rate of 
decline starting at approximately age 45.195 Jackson et 
al191 observed the rate of decline in CRF was steeper for 
men than women, but when the rate of decline was ex-
pressed as a percentage of peak CRF, men and women 
were almost identical.
Conclusions: Assigning CRF Values According to 
Age and Sex
• Age and sex significantly impact average CRF levels 
and should be considered when using CRF in clinical 
situations.
• Multiyear studies need to be conducted to better 
delineate the changes in the biological mechanisms 
by which sedentary behavior and exercise alter CRF.
BIoLoGICAL ADAPTATIoNS ELICITED BY 
EXERCISE TRAINING THAT IMPRoVE CRF
CRF is directly influenced by the hemodynamic deter-
minants of the Fick equation: V
⋅
o2=Qc×a-v O2 difference 
(oxygen uptake = cardiac output times the arteriovenous 
difference for oxygen) (see Levine197 and Heinonen et 
al198 for discussion). Cardiac output is determined by the 
product of HR and stroke volume. Because virtually ev-
ery exercise training study, regardless of length or inten-
sity, has reported no change or even a slight decline in 
HR max, increases in CRF occur primarily via increases 
in stroke volume, arteriovenous O2 difference, or both. 
Although total blood volume and hemoglobin increase 
with training, hemoglobin concentration remains stable 
or declines slightly, so that arterial oxygen content re-

e670
mains unchanged. Therefore, the 2 major adaptations 
that occur with exercise training are an increase in maxi-
mal stroke volume and a decrease in venous oxygen 
content caused by increased O2 extraction.
Generally, stroke volume increases via an increase in 
end-diastolic volume as a function of 3 key adaptations: 
an increase in total blood volume199; an improvement in 
left ventricular distensibility (larger left ventricular end-
diastolic volume for the same filling pressure)200; and 
improvement in diastolic function.201 Stroke volume can 
also increase via a decrease in end-systolic volume with 
improved ventriculoarterial coupling, likely because of 
enhanced endothelial function.202,203 Enlargement of the 
right ventricle appears to occur early in the course of 
exercise training and might be necessary to facilitate left 
ventricular adaptations.200
There are also significant changes in skeletal mus-
cle that increase O2 extraction. Probably the most 
important is an increase in muscle capillary density, 
which increases mean transit time for diffusion.204 
There are also increases in the size and number of 
skeletal muscle mitochondria and oxidative enzymes 
after training,205 although the capacity for mitochon-
drial respiration and skeletal muscle blood flow far 
exceed that of the circulation to deliver blood and 
oxygen to the muscle, even in untrained individuals. 
For young people, most studies show a balanced in-
crease in maximal cardiac output (from an increase in 
maximal stroke volume), and arteriovenous O2 differ-
ence200,204,206 with training. For older people, the train-
ing responses are more variable, although the final 
mechanisms of improvement largely depend on the 
duration and intensity of training.
Conclusions: Biological Changes Produced by 
Exercise That Contribute to the Increase in CRF
• Habitual endurance-type exercise produces a 
variety of biological adaptations that lead to an 
increase in peak/maximal CRF, primarily because 
of an increase in stroke volume and a decrease in 
venous oxygen content resulting from an increase 
in o2 extraction in the trained muscle.
• CRF can be increased in most people by regularly 
performing rhythmic contractions of large muscle 
groups continuously for an extended period of time 
at a moderate or vigorous intensity or with recovery 
breaks at lower intensity if the exercise approaches 
maximal effort.
DoSE oF EXERCISE REqUIRED  
To INCREASE CRF
The concept of peak/maximal V
⋅
o2 was established in 
1923 by Hill and Lupton.207 Early on, it was reported to 
vary with age, sex, and endurance training status208–210 
and to be increased by regular physical activity.211,212 
Also, CRF was shown to be an excellent measure of 
cardiorespiratory integrity.213,214 Subsequently, numer-
ous scientists evaluated a wide variety of factors that 
impact a person’s peak/maximal V
⋅
o2, with specific 
reference to the dose of physical activity needed to 
increase CRF. The key components of physical activity 
considered in determining the exercise dose include 
activity type, intensity, session frequency, time (ses-
sion duration), program duration, activity pattern, and 
progression.215 Although frequently considered sepa-
rately, each of these components interact with one 
another to impact the training response. Collectively, 
these data were consolidated into recommendations 
by the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) in 
“Position Stands” published in 1978, 1990, 1998, and 
2011.215–218
Studies Reporting on Physical Activity Dose and 
CRF Response (2000–2015)
In establishing dose recommendations for increasing 
CRF, we considered the results of experimental stud-
ies published between 2000 and 2015, as well as the 
relevant recommendations provided in the ACSM Posi-
tion Stands from 1978, 1990, 1998, and 2011. We 
also considered systematic reviews and meta-analy-
ses of studies that provided information on the dose 
response conducted in healthy adults and patients 
with chronic diseases. Key elements of these studies 
are included in Table 7 and summarized in the text. 
Table 7 was modified from a previous report on physi-
cal activity dose for increasing CRF268 that served as a 
major reference in the 2011 ACSM Position Stand.215 
We systematically searched the English literature for 
physical activity intervention trials published between 
2000 and 2015 that included details describing a 
standardized exercise dose, documentation of a high 
level of adherence to the prescribed regimen, and 
CRF measurement with expired air or estimated from 
maximum work rate on a motor-driven treadmill or cy-
cle ergometer at baseline and follow-up. In particular, 
we searched for data that augmented study results 
used in developing the 2011 ACSM recommendations 
for physical activity dose to increase CRF, as well as 
additional physical activity dose data on understudied 
populations.
We included 49 studies published between 2000 and 
2015 that met the inclusion criteria. Because of the sig-
nificant role baseline CRF plays in the absolute intensity 
of the exercise regimen, the review was stratified by the 
mean baseline CRF of study participants using the follow-
ing categories: (1) low (<9 METs); (2) intermediate (9–14 
METs); and (3) high (≥15 METs). We included studies in 
which CRF was determined with subjects exercising ei-

Low Baseline CRF ( ≤9 METs)
According to data from DREW (Dose Response to Exer-
cise in Women Aged 45 to 75 Years),225 statistically sig-
nificant increases in peak/maximal V
⋅
o2 can be achieved 
at physical activity intensities of ≤50% CRF over a period 
of 6 months when baseline peak/maximal V
⋅
o2 is in the 
range of 4 to 6 METs (15.5±2.8 mL·kg−1·min−1) for all 
subjects. In this study, women in the 3 physical activ-
ity groups trained at HRs equal to 50% peak/maximal 
 
V
⋅
o2 but with different physical activity amounts, and the 
increases in CRF were 0.6, 0.9, and 1.9 mL·kg−1·min−1 
(or 4.2%, 6.2%, and 8.2%) for programs requiring 4, 
8, and 12 kcal/kg body weight per week, respectively. 
Thus, at this moderate absolute intensity, there was a 
dose effect for physical activity amount. Also, in the 3 
physical activity training groups, the percentage of par-
ticipants who demonstrated a meaningful improvement 
in CRF increased as the amount of physical activity in-
creased. Other studies in participants with low baseline 
CRF have shown significant increases in CRF with physi-
cal activity of moderate intensities and bout durations 
in middle-aged overweight women240 and in overweight 
men and women,226 as well as with different modes of 
exercise (aerobic and resistance) in older women with 
abdominal obesity.232
Murphy et al271 conducted a meta-analysis of health 
outcomes including CRF changes that resulted from 
13 exercise “brisk walking” programs in men and 
women. The mean baseline CRF was ≈8 to 9 METs 
(≈30 mL·kg−1·min−1), and the average increase in CRF 
was 2.7 mL·kg−1·min−1, or 9.0%. The average walking 
intensity was at 70.1% of predicted maximal HR during 
bouts of 38.4 minutes per day on 4.4 days per week for 
34.9 weeks (average adherence was 87.8% of bouts 
prescribed). A recent systematic review of the health 
and performance changes achieved in 16 Nordic walk-
ing studies found significant increases in CRF.272 For ex-
ample, when Nordic walking by inactive women (baseline 
peak CRF of 25.8 mL·kg−1·min−1) was compared with 
regular walking, both at 50% HR reserve (40 minutes per 
session, 4 times per week, for 13 weeks), an increase of 
2.5 mL·kg−1·min−1 was observed (9.7%), which was sig-
nificantly different from control subjects but comparable 
to the 10% increase by women who performed regular 
walking.273 These studies demonstrated results similar 
to those of previous walking studies conducted in men274 
and women275,276 and support previous recommenda-
tions that brisk walking for at least 3 to 4 sessions per 
week for ≥30 minutes per session can significantly in-
crease CRF in people with low CRF.
The results of the STRRIDE study234 suggest that 
both exercise amount and intensity affect CRF in 40- to 
65-year-old overweight men and women after 7 to 9 
months of training. Groups that were compared with an 
inactive control group included those with a low amount 
of moderate-intensity exercise, a low amount of high-in-
tensity exercise, and a high amount of high-intensity ex-
ercise, where low intensity was defined as 40% to 55% 
peak V
⋅
o2 and high intensity as 65% to 80% peak V
⋅
o2. The 
low-amount groups walked or jogged the equivalent of 
19 km/wk, and the high-amount group walked or jogged 
32 km/wk. Baseline CRF was 27 to 29 mL·kg−1·min−1 for 
the 4 groups. Compared with the control group, the in-
crease in CRF was significant for the 3 exercise groups: 
6% for low amount, moderate intensity; 11% for low 
amount, high intensity; and 18% for high amount, high in-
tensity. These results demonstrate a dose response for 
increases in both physical activity intensity and amount 
in initially inactive overweight men and women. Ross et 
al257 reported similar CRF dose-response effects for ex-
ercise intensity and amount over 24 weeks in 300 obese 
men and women. At a fixed intensity of CRF (ie, 50% of 
peak V
⋅
o2), exercise performed 5 days per week for ≈30 
minutes per day was associated with a 9.4% increase 
in CRF, whereas exercise performed 5 days per week 
for ≈60 minutes per day at the same intensity was as-
sociated with a 15.6% increase in CRF. Moreover, an 
increase in exercise intensity from 50% to 75% of CRF 
was associated with a 19.6% increase in CRF, which was 
greater than the increase in CRF observed in response to 
the same amount of exercise performed at 50% CRF.257 
From these carefully controlled trials, it is clear that ex-
ercise consistent with consensus recommendations is 
associated with an ≈10% improvement in CRF in previ-
ously sedentary adults. Increasing either the amount or 
intensity of exercise further improves CRF.
A meta-analysis of 41 physical activity trials in gen-
erally healthy older men and women (mean age ≥60 
years) reported that CRF increased an average (net 
above change in control subjects) of 3.8 mL·kg−1·min−1 
(16.3%).277 This difference was significant at P<0.001 
for pooled standardized effect size. The average base-
line CRF was comparable in the activity and control 
groups, 23.3 mL·kg−1·min−1, respectively. Average ses-
sion frequency was 3.3±0.7 times per week, duration 
was 38.1±10 minutes, and intensity generally approxi-
mated 40% to 75% of HR reserve. Greater increases in 
CRF were seen in physical activity programs that lasted 
longer than 20 weeks and with a physical activity intensity 
≥60% but <70% of peak/maximal V
⋅
o2. Fujimoto et al203 
 
demonstrated that selected inactive older men and 
women can substantially increase CRF in response to a 
vigorous exercise training regimen that lasts 12 months. 
In 9 men and women (70.6±3 years of age) who par-
ticipated in a progressively more demanding physical 
activity program of both continuous and interval training, 
peak/maximal V
⋅
o2 increased by 19.3%, from 22.8±3.4 
to 27.2±4.3 mL·kg−1·min−1 (P<0.001).

Intermediate Baseline CRF (9–14 METs)
Most studies of physical activity dose and CRF response 
in adults with intermediate CRF at baseline have been 
conducted in generally healthy young and middle-aged 
men and women who are somewhat active at baseline. 
For example, in the HERITAGE (Health, Risk Factors, Ex-
ercise Training and Genetics) study,259,278 inactive black 
(n=198) and white (n=435) men and women aged 17 
to 65 years exercised in 30- to 50-minute sessions 3 
times per week for 20 weeks at an HR of 55% to 75% of 
maximal HR on cycle ergometers (session duration and 
intensity progressively increased approximately every 2 
weeks). The mean baseline CRF was 31.8 mL·kg−1·min−1 
(9 METs), and the mean increase was 5.4 mL·kg−1·min−1 
(17.8%, or 1.6 METs). Although substantial between-
person variation was noted in the CRF response to exer-
cise training, the authors concluded that age, sex, race, 
and initial CRF had little effect on the CRF response to 
a standardized physical activity program (with intensity 
expressed as a percentage of maximal). Other recent re-
ports assessing physical activity dose and its effects on 
CRF in men and women with intermediate CRF at base-
line used training regimens that met 2011 ACSM Posi-
tion Stand recommendations.236,244,261 The 60% to 75% 
V
⋅
o2R (V
⋅
o2 reserve) for people in this category is in the 
range of 5–10 METs, which indicates that aerobic activi-
ties for increasing CRF would include brisk walking on a 
flat surface at >4.0 mph, hiking 3.0 mph in hilly terrain, 
slow jogging (5.0–6.0 mph), road cycling (9–15 mph), 
or swimming (moderate effort).279 Exact speeds for each 
person during any of these activities can be guided by 
their target HR.280
High Baseline CRF ( ≥14 METs)
Physical activity studies investigating changes in CRF 
have been conducted in physically active and highly fit 
men and women, including noncompetitive and competi-
tive distance runners and cyclists with mean baseline 
CRF values between 14 and 20 METs (reviewed in Midg-
ley et al281). Much of the recent physical activity dose 
research in fit and highly fit men and women has focused 
on a comparison of the effectiveness of physical activ-
ity intensities between 70% and 80% versus exercise 
at or near (90% to 95%) of peak/maximal V
⋅
o2 or maxi-
mal HR.235–237 For subjects with CRF in the range of 15 
to 18 METs, the results of these studies indicate that 
physical activity at an intensity ≥70% CRF of adequate 
training volume and length (ie, ≥3 days per week, ≥8 
weeks) results in significant increases in CRF. It is still 
not clear under what circumstances very high-intensity 
interval training (HIT; ≥90% CRF or maximum HR) elicits 
greater increases in CRF than the less intense exercise 
programs in fit and very fit people.231,237 Among people 
with a CRF ≥13 METs, the primary goal of increasing 
CRF is generally more related to improving performance 
than health.
Conclusions: Research Establishing the Dose of 
Exercise Required to Increase CRF
• When performed frequently over weeks or months, 
a wide variety of endurance-type physical activity 
regimens produce clinically significant increases in 
CRF (ie, ≥1 MET) in most adults.
• In general, the greater the activity amount or inten-
sity, the greater the increase in CRF. Increases in 
CRF appear more responsive to increases in inten-
sity than increases in session duration or frequency.
• The higher the baseline CRF, the more vigorous the 
intensity needed to produce a clinically significant 
increase in CRF. For example, in adults with a CRF 
<10 METs, a training intensity of ≈50% HR reserve or 
 
V
⋅
o2R is adequate; at a CRF level of 10 to 14 METs, 
training intensities in the range of 65% to 85% of 
HR reserve or V
⋅
o2R are likely more effective, and 
among those with a capacity >14 METs, a training 
intensity >85% HR or V
⋅
o2R may be needed for most 
participants to obtain a significant increase in CRF.
HIGH-INTENSITY TRAINING AND CRF
In recent years, the major addition to the CRF dose-
response literature was from the increasing number of 
reports evaluating the effects of HIT and sprint interval 
training. Interval training, the alternating of higher- and 
lower-intensity bouts of exercise during a single session, 
was originally used by endurance athletes and evalu-
ated by sport medicine scientists in Europe >50 years 
ago.282,283 More recently, moderate-intensity interval 
training (50%–75% HR reserve or V
⋅
o2R) has been used 
in health-oriented fitness regimens for healthy adults and 
in cardiovascular and pulmonary rehabilitation.272,284
In healthy adults, HIT regimens have been shown to 
be effective by inducing greater increases in CRF than 
moderate-intensity continuous training (MICT) regimens, 
especially when total amounts of energy expended in 
the different regimens are similar.236,237,285 For example, 
Gormley et al studied 61 healthy young men and women 
who were randomized to a nonexercise control group 
or 1 of 3 exercise groups: MICT (60 minutes, 4 days 
per week at 50% V
⋅
o2R), vigorous intensity (40 minutes, 
4 days per week at 75% V

o2R), or near-maximal ef-
fort (HIT 3 days per week, 5 minutes at 75% V

lowed by 5 intervals of 5 minutes at 95% V

6-week program was similar for the 3 exercise groups.

was significantly different between each of the exer-
cise groups, demonstrating a dose response for ex-
ercise intensity at the high end of the intensity spec-
trum. HIT and MICT effects on CRF have also been 
compared in healthy obese men and women,258 people 
with metabolic syndrome,261 hypertensive patients,250 
and patients with T2DM,238 with HIT eliciting significant-
ly greater increases in CRF than MICT despite similar 
energy expenditure.
In several recent randomized controlled studies involv-
ing patients with CVD, including HF, that compared the 
effects of HIT versus MICT on CRF or physical working 
capacity, HIT was found to be superior in some256,264,266 
but not all studies.230,258,262 SAINTEX-CAD (Study on Aero-
bic Interval Exercise Training in CAD) compared the ef-
fects of HIT versus MICT on CRF in 200 patients with 
coronary artery disease.230 After 12 weeks of training, 
investigators found no difference in the mean increase in 
peak/maximal V
⋅
o2 (22.7% for HIT and 20.3% for MICT). 
However, in this study, the difference between train-
ing intensity was smaller than planned between the 2 
groups (the MICT group trained at 80% versus planned 
65%–75% of peak HR, whereas the HIT group trained at 
88% versus the planned 90%–95% of peak HR), which 
made the training protocols nonisocaloric. Three small 
meta-analyses reported significant increases in CRF in 
response to selected HIT and MICT regimens in patients 
with various manifestations of CVD.277,286,287 In another 
meta-analysis, 6 randomized clinical trials with a total 
of 153 patients were included, but only 4 randomized 
controlled trials with 111 patients had adequately re-
ported peak/maximal V
⋅
o2 data.277 Compared with MICT, 
HIT significantly improved peak/maximal V
⋅
o2 (mean dif-
ference, 3.6 mL·kg−1·min−1; 95% confidence interval, 
2.3–4.9). Similar results were shown in patients with 
HF with preserved ejection fraction.219 Weston and 
colleagues286 included 10 studies and 273 patients in 
their meta-analysis and concluded that HIT significantly 
increased CRF by almost double that of MICT (HIT 5.4 
mL·kg−1·min−1 versus MICT 2.6 mL·kg−1·min−1; mean dif-
ference, 3.03 mL·kg−1·min−1; 95% confidence interval, 
2.00–4.07 mL·kg−1·min−1). On the basis of their meta-
analysis of 6 randomized controlled trials comparing 
HIT and MICT in patients with coronary artery disease, 
Elliott and colleagues287 concluded that HIT was more 
effective than MICT for increasing CRF but also recom-
mended that long-term studies assessing morbidity and 
mortality after HIT are required before this approach can 
be more widely adopted. Moholdt et al249 compared HIT 
and MICT regimens in patients after coronary artery by-
pass surgery and reported that for short-term training (4 
weeks), peak/maximal V
⋅
o2 increased significantly in both 
groups. However, with continued training up to 6 months, 
those patients performing HIT further increased their 
 
V
⋅
o2 peak (P<0.001), whereas the MICT patients did not.249 
Thus, the duration of the training program might influ-
ence which regimen is most effective for increasing CRF 
in selected patient populations.
Conclusions: High-Intensity Training and CRF
• Both HIT and MICT regimens can be effective for 
increasing CRF in healthy adults and patients with 
CVD. When total work performed during train-
ing is held constant, HIT is likely to elicit greater 
increases in CRF than MICT. Results across stud-
ies are inconsistent in comparisons of the effects 
of HIT and MICT on increasing CRF. Reasons for 
these differences may include population-specific 
response differences, training protocol variations 
(intensity, session duration, training duration), and 
differences in testing protocols.
• The role of HIT regimens in the reduction of car-
diovascular clinical events remains unclear, and the 
added risk of musculoskeletal and cardiac compli-
cations in selected patients needs additional evalu-
ation. Most studies on the clinical benefits of HIT in 
cardiac rehabilitation have used MICT for compara-
tive purposes, and long-term validation in patient 
populations is needed.
• Although HIT may be as safe as MICT for patients 
with CVD, more data are needed.
In summary, there is an age and sex effect on the dis-
tribution of CRF in the general adult population, with 
women and older people having lower values. Also, 
inactive men and women vary in their CRF, in part be-
cause of genetic differences and other factors, and 
there are genetic-based interindividual differences in 
their response to a standardized physical activity regi-
men.10,288 However, CRF responses to a standardized 
physical activity regimen (similar type, amount, and in-
tensity as percentage of capacity) are not significantly 
influenced by age or sex.278,289 Thus, a standardized 
approach to recommending dose parameters can be 
used in adult populations, taking into consideration 
individual levels of CRF, exercise preferences, and 
opportunities for increasing physical activity over the 
long term. Most of the lower mortality risk associated 
with a higher CRF occurs by the time a CRF of 10 to 12 
METs is achieved. CRF values >12 METs are associ-
ated with a relatively lower impact on risk of all-cause 
and CVD mortality. Below 10 METs, as CRF decreases, 
risk progressively becomes higher at an accelerated 
rate.290 Thus, to lower CVD risk by increasing CRF, the 
gains appear in men and women with baseline CRF ≤10 
METs. Results from various studies evaluating CRF and 
CVD risk indicate that an increase in CRF of even 1 MET 
is associated with a 10% to 20% decrease in mortality 
rates.2,16,18,97 In addition, a review of varied physical ac-
tivity regimens (Table 7) indicates that exercise increas-
es CRF by at least 10% (a 1-MET increase for individu-
als with a capacity of 10 METs). Thus, to decrease CVD

with an initial target of increasing CRF ≥10%. Further 
 
increases in CRF may require additional increases in 
physical activity intensity or amount. Recommendations 
listed in Table 8 provide information on each of the physi-
cal activity components that should be considered in the 
implementation of a physical activity program.
FUTURE DIRECTIoNS AND CoNCLUSIoNS
Although there is now substantial evidence that low levels 
of CRF are associated with a heightened risk of cardio-
vascular and all-cause mortality, unanswered questions 
remain. Here, we provide recommendations for future 
research that although not exhaustive, offer direction to 
unravel some of the vagaries between CRF and selected 
health outcomes.
• Additional evidence is required to identify the cut 
points or thresholds that identify low, moderate, and 
high CRF across age, sex, and race. Organizations 
such as the American Heart Association and 
National Institutes of Health should convene a con-
sensus development conference and invite leading 
scientists in this area to develop these data.
• Prospective trials should be initiated to determine 
how the routine implementation of CRF assessment 
in the primary care setting alters the trajectory of 
clinical care (ie, identifying individuals with a low 
CRF and using that information to help guide clinical 
decision making). Would such an approach improve 
clinical outcome and reduce healthcare expen-
ditures? Conducting such trials was suggested 
previously.291
• Because much of the CVD risk associated with 
low CRF is in the range of 4 to 10 METs, long-term 
randomized clinical trials (≥3 years) of moderate-
intensity activities in community-based facilities 
(eg, group walking, dancing) will help to clarify the 
associated improvements in fitness and other CVD 
biomarkers. There remains a need to document the 
impact of scalable approaches to increase the long-
term physical activity of populations with CRF levels 
that put them at risk of CVD.
CoNCLUSIoNS
An underlying premise of this statement is that CRF 
should be measured in clinical practice if it can provide 
additional information that influences patient manage-
ment. Indeed, decades of research have produced un-
equivocal evidence that CRF provides independent and 
additive morbidity and mortality data that when added 
to traditional risk factors significantly improves CVD risk 
prediction. On the basis of these observations alone, not 
including CRF measurement in routine clinical practice 
fails to provide an optimal approach for stratifying pa-
tients according to risk. As noted in numerous recent 
American Heart Association scientific statements, the 
measurement of CRF in clinical settings is both impor-
tant and feasible.74,75,152,153,292 Additionally, estimates of 
CRF using nonexercise algorithms have pragmatic im-
portance and provide values for CRF that enhance risk 
prediction when direct CRF measures are not feasible. 
In fact, routine estimation of CRF in clinical practice is 
Table 8. Exercise Recommendations to  
Increase CRF
Type
Exercise that involves major muscle groups (legs, 
arms, trunk) that is continuous and rhythmic in 
nature (eg, brisk walking, jogging, running cycling, 
swimming, rowing, cross-country skiing, climbing 
stairs, active dancing), in contrast to high-resistance 
muscle-strengthening activities that produce limited 
CRF benefits.
Intensity
Moderate and/or vigorous intensity relative to the 
person’s capacity recommended for most healthy 
adults (≥50% V
⋅ o2R or HRR) Strong evidence 
of benefit in young and older men and women, 
overweight and obese people, and patients with 
CVD after obtaining medical clearance. Light- 
to moderate-intensity exercise is of benefit in 
deconditioned or older people. Higher percent effort 
may be needed in highly fit people for CRF increase.
Frequency
≥5 d/wk of moderate exercise, or ≥3 d/wk of 
vigorous-intensity exercise, or a combination of 
moderate and vigorous exercise on 3–5 d/wk.
Time
30–60 min/d (150 min/wk) of moderate-intensity 
exercise, or 20–60 min/d (75 min/wk) of vigorous 
exercise, or a combination of moderate and vigorous 
exercise per day for most adults; <20 but ≥10 
min/d (<150 min/wk) of exercise can be beneficial, 
especially in previously inactive people. Sessions 
should be ≥10 min.
Amount
A target amount of 500–1000 MET-min/wk is 
recommended. Exercising below these amounts may 
still be beneficial for people unable or unwilling to 
reach this amount of exercise.
Pattern
Exercise may be performed in one (continuous) 
session per day or in multiple sessions per day of 
≥10 min each to accumulate the desired amount 
of exercise per day. Exercise bouts of ≤10 min 
may yield favorable adaptations in deconditioned 
individuals. High-intensity interval training can be 
effective in adults with good exercise tolerance.
Progression
A gradual progression of exercise volume by 
adjusting exercise duration, frequency, and/or 
intensity is reasonable until the desired exercise goal 
(maintenance) is achieved. Progression may reduce 
risks of musculoskeletal injury and adverse CVD events.

CLINICAL STATEMENTS  
AND GUIDELINES
no more difficult than measuring blood pressure, and 
procedures for incorporating CRF estimation into routine 
clinical assessments in a pragmatic manner are pro-
vided in Tables 9 and 10. Finally, of crucial importance 
is the repeated observation that one does not need to 
be highly fit to gain benefit from improvements in CRF. 
Indeed, numerous epidemiological studies have now 
demonstrated that more than half the reduction in all-
cause and CVD mortality generally occurs when moving 
from the least fit group to the next least fit group. For 
many people, this can be achieved by routine, moderate-
intensity exercise consistent with consensus guidelines; 
lower levels of physical activity may be all that is needed 
to derive a clinically significant benefit in habitually sed-
entary individuals. This has implications for physical ac-
tivity counselling, given that considerable benefits are 
likely to occur by encouraging the most sedentary or 
low-fit individuals to engage in modest amounts of physi-
cal activity accumulated throughout the day. Although 
gaps in knowledge remain, and refinement of CRF tar-
gets for risk reduction across age and sex need further 
investigation, the evidence reviewed suggests that the 
measurement of CRF improves patient management and 
that its omission from routine clinical practice for the 
vast majority of patients is unacceptable. Accordingly, 
the inclusion of CRF measurement or estimation in rou-
tine practice affords clinicians with a vitally important 
opportunity to improve patient management and, more 
importantly, patient health.

Table 9. General Recommendations for 
Measurement of CRF During Routine Clinical Visits
1.  
At a minimum, all adults should have CRF estimated each year 
using a nonexercise algorithm during their annual healthcare 
examination.* Clinicians may consider the use of submaximal 
exercise tests or field tests as alternatives, because these involve 
individual-specific exercise responses.
2.  
Ideally, all adults should have CRF estimated using a maximal 
test,† if feasible using CPX,*‡ on a regular basis similar to other 
preventative services.293 The specific age of first assessment and 
schedule for follow-up are yet to be established. However, patients 
with higher CVD risk profiles should have an initial test at an earlier 
age and be tested more frequently than patients with lower risk 
profiles.
3.  
Adults with chronic disease should have CRF measured with a 
peak or symptom-limited CPX on a regular§ basis.
CRF indicates cardiorespiratory fitness; and CPX, cardiopulmonary 
exercise testing.
*Recommendation to estimate CRF is for the purpose of assessing 
fitness and not coronary heart disease. Nonexercise estimates of CRF 
provide clinicians the opportunity to counsel patients regarding the 
importance of performing regular physical activity. 
†See “Maximal Exercise Testing Without CPX Measurements.”
‡See “Maximal Exercise Testing With CPX Measurements.”
