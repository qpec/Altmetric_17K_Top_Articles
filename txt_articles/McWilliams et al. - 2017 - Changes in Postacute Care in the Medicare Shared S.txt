Abstract
Importance—Post-acute care is thought to be a major source of wasteful spending. The extent to 
which accountable care organizations (ACOs) can limit post-acute spending has implications for 
the importance and design of other payment models that include post-acute care.
Objective—To assess changes in post-acute spending and utilization associated with provider 
participation as ACOs in the Medicare Shared Savings Program (MSSP) and the pathways by 
which they occurred.
Design and Setting—Using fee-for-service Medicare claims from 2009–2014, we conducted 
difference-in-difference comparisons of beneficiaries served by ACOs with beneficiaries served by 
local non-ACO providers (control group) before vs. after entry into the MSSP. We estimated 
differential changes separately for cohorts of ACOs entering the MSSP in 2012, 2013, and 2014.
Participants—Random 20% sample of beneficiaries with 25,544,650 patient-years, 8,395,426 
hospital admissions, and 1,595,352 SNF stays from 2009–2014.
Exposure—Patient attribution to an ACO in the MSSP.
Main Outcomes and Measures—Post-acute spending, discharge to a facility, length of SNF 
stays, readmissions, use of highly-rated SNFs, and mortality, adjusted for patient characteristics.
Results—For the 2012 cohort of ACOs, MSSP participation was associated with an overall 
reduction in post-acute spending (differential change in 2014 for ACOs vs. control group: −$106/
beneficiary or −9.0%; P=0.003) that was driven by differential reductions in inpatient utilization,

 discharges to facilities rather than home (−0.6 percentage points or −2.7%; P=0.03), and length of 
SNF stays (−0.60 days/stay or −2.2%; P=0.002). Reductions in SNF use and length of stay were 
due largely to within-hospital or within-SNF changes in care specifically for ACO patients. MSSP 
participation was associated with smaller significant reductions in SNF spending in 2014 for the 
2013 ACO cohort but not in the 2013 or 2014 cohort’s first year of participation. Estimates were 
similar for ACOs with and without financial ties to hospitals. MSSP participation was not 
associated with significant changes in 30-day readmissions, use of highly-rated SNFs, or mortality.
Conclusion and Relevance—Participation in the MSSP has been associated with significant 
reductions in post-acute spending without ostensible deterioration in quality. Spending reductions 
were more consistent with clinicians working within hospitals and SNFs to influence care for 
ACO patients than with hospital-wide initiatives by ACOs or use of preferred SNFs.
Spending on post-acute care accounts for much of the wide geographic variation in 
Medicare spending and has more than doubled since 2001.1,2 The rapid growth in post-acute 
spending has been driven by increasing use of care in skilled nursing facilities (SNFs),2 
which are the most common type of post-acute facility used and are reimbursed by Medicare 
on a per diem basis. Excessive use of post-acute SNF care is thought to be a major source of 
wasteful spending and natural target for providers participating in new payment models that 
reward providers for reducing spending below a budget, such as the Medicare accountable 
care organization (ACO) programs and Bundled Payments for Care Improvement initiative.3
Through the first full year of operation, evaluations of the Medicare ACO programs—
including the Pioneer model and Medicare Shared Savings Program (MSSP)—found 
proportionately larger savings in SNF spending than in other spending categories, suggesting 
that ACOs are indeed focusing on post-acute care in their strategies to reduce spending.4,5 
These early gains are consistent with expectations that wasteful spending is easier to cut 
when more abundant and with the stronger incentives that ACOs have to limit use of 
services they do not provide relative to services they do provide.4–7 Specifically, because 
most ACOs do not include SNFs in their organization or ACO contract,8,9 shared-savings 
bonuses achieved by lowering spending on SNF care are typically not offset by foregone 
fee-for-service profits.
The early reductions in SNF spending also suggest that organizations can successfully 
influence care in facilities they do not own.4,5,10,11 For example, ACOs can direct patients to 
a preferred network of more efficient SNFs and can employ, or partner with, clinicians and 
case managers to follow patients in SNFs.12–14 Research to date, however, has not 
demonstrated the extent of post-acute savings in the ACO programs after 2013, the source of 
these savings, or the strategies used to achieve them.
METHODS
Study Overview
In the MSSP, ACOs receive shared-savings bonuses if they hold total Medicare spending 
sufficiently below a budget (or benchmark) and meet minimum performance standards. 
Using Medicare claims from 2008–2014, we conducted difference-in-differences 
comparisons to estimate changes in post-acute spending and utilization associated with

 participation in the MSSP. Specifically, we compared beneficiaries served by MSSP ACOs 
with beneficiaries in ACO service areas served by non-participating providers (the control 
group) before vs. after the start of ACO contracts. We separately examined each cohort of 
ACOs entering the MSSP in 2012, 2013, and 2014, as previous evaluations have 
demonstrated that savings differ by year of entry.5,11
We conducted 4 sets of analyses. First, to obtain overall population estimates, we analyzed 
inpatient, post-acute facility, and home health spending among all beneficiaries, with 
patient-years as the units of analysis. Second, to eliminate changes in use of post-acute care 
due to changes in hospital admission rates, we analyzed post-acute care use and spending 
conditional on hospitalization, with admissions as the units of analysis. Third, to isolate 
spending reductions due to shorter length of SNF stays, we analyzed SNF spending and 
length of stay conditional on discharge to a SNF, with SNF stays as the units of analysis. 
Fourth, we analyzed 30-day readmissions, use of highly-rated SNFs, and mortality to assess 
related changes in quality of care.
We then conducted additional analyses to further characterize mechanisms for changes in 
post-acute care. Specifically, we tested whether changes in post-acute care for hospitalized 
ACO patients were the result of hospital-wide changes or changes in care selectively 
affecting ACO patients within hospitals. In a related subgroup analysis, we compared results 
between ACOs with and without financial ties to hospitals. While independent physician 
groups without such ties might still influence discharge planning for their patients within 
hospitals,10 ACOs that are financially integrated with hospitals are more likely to have the 
additional option of implementing hospital-wide strategies. Finally, we assessed the extent to 
which changes in SNF spending and length of stay were due to use of different SNFs vs. 
changes in care for ACO patients within SNFs.
Study Population
For each study year from 2009–2014, we analyzed data from Medicare claims and 
enrollment files for a random 20% sample of fee-for-service beneficiaries continuously 
enrolled in Parts A and B in that year (while alive for decedents) and in the previous year (to 
assess preexisting conditions). Using previously described methods and the CMS ACO 
Provider-level Research Identifiable File, which defines each ACO as a collection of 
provider taxpayer identification numbers (TINs) and CMS Certification Numbers (for 
safety-net providers),5,15 we attributed each beneficiary in each study year to the ACO or 
non-ACO TIN accounting for the most allowed charges for office visits with a primary care 
physician during that year (eAppendix). In sensitivity analyses, we modified definitions of 
ACOs to address potential bias from changes in constituent TINs and physicians over time 
(eAppendix). We excluded beneficiaries without a visit with a primary care physician.
Study Variables
Acute and Post-Acute Care Spending and Use—For analyses of all beneficiaries in 
our study sample, we assessed annual per-beneficiary Medicare spending for inpatient care, 
care in post-acute facilities (overall and by facility type), and home health care initiated in 
the community (outpatient) vs. after a hospitalization or post-acute facility stay (post-acute). 
McWilliams et al.

 Facility types included SNFs, inpatient rehabilitation facilities (IRFs), and long-term care 
hospitals (LTCHs).
For admission-level analyses, we assessed the following for the post-acute period: discharge 
to a facility vs. home; spending for facility stays and number of covered days spent in a 
facility (by facility type); and spending for home health care and number of days of home 
health care. We defined the post-acute period to begin at hospital discharge and end at the 
conclusion of any episode of post-acute care (inclusive of facility to facility transfers and 
home health care following hospital or post-acute facility stays), at the start of another 
hospitalization if the patient was hospitalized while receiving post-acute care, or at discharge 
if no post-acute care was provided. Admissions without any post-acute facility or home 
health care contributed zeroes to analyses of spending and use during the post-acute period. 
In addition, we determined the diagnosis-related group (DRG) payment weight, inpatient 
spending, and length of stay for each admission to test whether reductions in admissions 
achieved by ACOs led to changes in case mix among patients admitted in the post-contract 
period. For analyses of post-acute SNF stays, we assessed spending per stay and length of 
stay.
Quality of Care—We examined 3 measures to detect potential changes in quality of care 
associated with MSSP participation. First, we assessed annual mortality in the beneficiary-
level analysis of the full study sample. Second, for both admission-level and SNF stay-level 
analyses, we assessed readmissions within 30 days of hospital discharge. We examined 
readmissions because they are included as a quality measure in ACO contracts and because 
reductions in readmission rates could mechanically lengthen post-acute facility stays and 
thus influence interpretation of results. Third, for SNF stay-level analyses, we determined 
the star rating for the SNF to which beneficiaries were discharged from publicly available 
Nursing Home Compare data.16 The star rating is a composite of ratings from health 
inspections, 16 quality measures, and staffing, blending both short and long stays. We used 
pre-contract data from 2011 to create an indicator for being discharged to a four-star or five-
star (highly-rated) facility.
Patient Characteristics—From Master Beneficiary Summary Files for each study year, 
we assessed age, sex, race/ethnicity,17,18 Medicaid coverage, disability as the original reason 
for Medicare eligibility, and end-stage renal disease. From the Chronic Conditions Data 
Warehouse (CCW), which draws from diagnoses since 1999 to describe accumulated disease 
burden,19 we assessed the presence of each of 27 conditions by the start of each study year. 
From diagnoses in the preceding year of claims, we calculated a Hierarchical Condition 
Categories (HCC) risk score for each beneficiary in each study year.20 We determined 
whether beneficiaries were long-term nursing home residents in the prior year using a 
validated claims-based algorithm.21 Finally, from U.S. Census data,22 we assessed area-level 
sociodemographic characteristics.
ACO Subgroup Comparison—For a pre-specified subgroup comparison, we used CMS 
descriptions and information on organizations’ websites to categorize ACOs as financially 
integrated with hospitals (e.g., integrated delivery systems and physician-hospital 
organizations) vs. independent physician groups, some of which partner with hospitals in

 ACO contracts but are not owned by hospitals or health systems. Because baseline levels of 
efficiency have been predictive of ACO savings,4,5,11 we adjusted this subgroup comparison 
for differences in spending reductions associated with baseline SNF use (eAppendix).
Statistical Analysis
We fit linear regression models predicting each dependent variable as a function of ACO 
fixed effects (omitting the control group as the reference group), fixed effects for the 
beneficiary’s hospital referral region (HRR) of residence, year fixed effects, interactions 
between HRR and year fixed effects, the patient characteristics listed in Table 1, and 
indicators for each ACO cohort in each post-contract year. For each ACO cohort, the last set 
of indicators estimated changes from the pre-contract period to each post-contract year for 
beneficiaries attributed to ACOs that differed from local concurrent changes for beneficiaries 
attributed to non-ACO providers (the estimate of interest). Interactions between these 
indicators and ACO subgroups were added for subgroup comparisons. The ACO fixed 
effects adjusted for pre-contract differences between each ACO and the control group and 
for changes in the distribution of beneficiaries across ACOs. The HRR by year fixed effects 
adjusted for geographic differences between the ACO and control groups and for HRR-
specific changes in use of acute or post-acute care in the control group.
Thus, we used pre-contract levels for ACOs and local concurrent changes from the pre-
contract to post-contract period in the control group to establish counterfactuals that would 
be expected in the absence of MSSP participation, and we estimated changes that differed 
from this expectation (i.e., the differential change or the change attributable to MSSP 
participation). The pre-contract period in the model differed by ACO cohort: 2009–2011 for 
the 2012 cohort, 2009–2012 for the 2013 cohort, and 2009–2013 for the 2014 cohort. 
Models of admissions and SNF stays additionally included DRG fixed effects. We used 
robust variance estimators to account for clustering within ACOs (for the ACO group) or 
HRRs (for the control group).23
We conducted admission-level analyses with and without fixed effects for each hospital by 
year combination to determine the extent to which differential changes in post-acute care 
were due to within-hospital changes in care specifically for ACO patients vs. hospital-wide 
changes affecting post-acute care for all admitted patients (by comparing estimates from 
models with and without the fixed effects). We similarly conducted SNF stay-level analyses 
with and without SNF fixed effects to determine the extent to which differential changes in 
SNF spending and length of stay were due to discharges of ACO patients to different 
facilities vs. changes in care specifically for ACO patients within SNFs.
As pre-specified in our study protocol, we took several measures to limit the number of 
statistical tests that were conducted for supporting inferences. First, we focused on SNF-
related variables as our main outcomes and considered spending on SNF care to be the 
primary outcome, because SNF spending was the main source of post-acute savings in 
Medicare ACO programs in their first full year of operation.4,5 Second, we conducted 
admission-level analyses only for ACO cohorts with significant differential changes in SNF 
spending in beneficiary-level analyses, and we conducted SNF stay-level analyses only for 
ACO cohorts with significant differential changes in admission-level analyses. Third, we

 considered tests of differential changes in 2014 as primary, given evidence of growing 
savings in the MSSP from 2013 and 2014.11 We present 2013 estimates for descriptive 
purposes, except that we pooled estimates across 2013 and 2014 in subgroup comparisons to 
enhance precision. We treated 2012 as a transition year for the 2012 ACO cohort, effectively 
excluding it from both the pre-contract and post-contract periods, because ACOs in this 
cohort entered in April or July rather than January.
We conducted additional analyses to explore potential sources of bias. First, we compared 
trends in each outcome between each ACO cohort and the control group during the pre-
contract period. Similar pre-contract trends would support our assumption that changes from 
the pre-contract to post-contract periods would have been similar for the ACO and control 
groups in the absence of the ACO programs. Second, we tested whether patient 
characteristics and inpatient admission characteristics differentially changed from the pre-
contract to post-contract period in the ACO groups relative to the control group.
RESULTS
Beneficiary-level analyses included 25,544,650 patient-years from 2009–2014, with 
approximately 19% of beneficiaries attributed to ACOs annually on average. Admission-
level analyses included 8,395,426 admissions, and SNF-level analyses included 1,595,352 
SNF stays. In analyses adjusted for geography only, differences in patient characteristics 
between ACO-attributed beneficiaries and the control group in the pre-contract period were 
mostly small (eTable 1) and changed minimally from the pre-contract period to 2014 (Table 
1). In analyses of admissions and SNF stays, differential changes in patient characteristics, 
DRG payment weights, spending per admission, and admission length of stay also were 
minimal (Table 1). Adjusted pre-contract trends in all dependent variables were similar for 
ACO-attributed beneficiaries and the control group, as were adjusted pre-contract means for 
most measures (Tables 2–4, eTables 2–3).
Beneficiary-level Analysis
2012 Entry Cohort—In comparisons of ACOs entering the MSSP in 2012 with the 
control group, MSSP participation was associated with reductions in total annual inpatient 
spending (differential change in 2014 for ACOs vs. control group: −$77/beneficiary or 
−2.3% of the pre-contract mean; P=0.006) and post-acute spending in facilities (−$106/
beneficiary or −9.0%; P=0.003), the latter driven mostly by reduced spending on SNF care 
(Table 2). MSSP participation also was associated with a differential reduction in spending 
in 2014 for home health care in the outpatient setting (−$16/beneficiary or −3.1%; P=0.03) 
but not the post-acute setting ($2/beneficiary or 1.9%; P=0.31). Differential changes in 2013 
in inpatient and SNF spending were significant but smaller (Table 2).
2013 and 2014 Entry Cohorts—For ACOs entering the MSSP in 2013 (eTable 2), 
MSSP participation was associated with a significant reduction in SNF spending in 2014 
(differential change in 2014: −$27/beneficiary or −3.3%; P=0.01) but not inpatient spending 
(−$33/beneficiary or −1.0%; P=0.28) and with no significant differential changes in 2013. 
For the 2014 entry cohort (results not tabulated), MSSP participation was not associated 
with a significant change in either inpatient spending (−$8/beneficiary or −0.2%; P=0.78) or

 SNF spending ($4/beneficiary or 0.5%; P=0.66) in 2014, so admission-level and SNF stay-
level analyses were not pursued.
Admission-level Analysis
2012 Entry Cohort—For the 2012 entry cohort of ACOs, MSSP participation was 
associated with significant reductions in 2014 in the proportion discharged to a post-acute 
facility (differential change in 2014: −0.6 percentage points or −2.7%; P=0.03), spending on 
SNF care in the post-acute period (−$124/admission or −5.6%; P=0.002), days in a SNF 
during the post-acute period (−0.22/admission or −4.1%; P=0.02), and use of LTCHs (Table 
3). Estimates were largely unchanged after adjustment for hospital-level means in the year of 
admission, indicating that reductions in SNF use were due to different treatment of ACO-
attributed patients within hospitals.
2013 ACO Entry Cohort—For the 2013 MSSP cohort (eTable 3), the differential change 
in 2014 in post-acute SNF spending was not statistically significant (−$50/admission or 
−2.3%; P=0.07), so SNF stay-level analyses were not pursued.
SNF Stay-level Analysis
For the 2012 entry cohort of ACOs (Table 4), MSSP participation was associated with 
significant reductions in spending per SNF stay (differential change in 2014: −$393/stay or 
−3.5%; P<0.001) and length of SNF stay (−0.60 days/stay or −2.2%; P=0.002). Adjustment 
for the SNF to which patients were discharged reduced these estimates by 23–25%, 
indicating that most of these reductions were due to changes in care specifically for ACO 
patients within SNFs rather than shifts to different SNFs.
Subgroup Analysis
Estimated reductions in inpatient and SNF spending associated with MSSP participation 
were consistently greater in the 2012 and 2013 entry cohorts for independent physician 
groups than for ACOs financially integrated with hospitals, but these differences were not 
statistically significant (Figure, eFigure).
Quality of Care
MSSP participation was not associated with differential changes in mortality (Table 2, 
eTable 2), 30-day readmissions (Tables 3–4, eTable 3), or the proportion of patients 
discharged to 4-star or 5-star SNFs (Table 4).
DISCUSSION
Spending on post-acute SNF care for patients of ACOs entering the MSSP in 2012 or 2013 
was significantly reduced in 2014 relative to local concurrent changes among patients served 
by non-participating providers. Consistent with changes in total Medicare spending 
associated with MSSP participation,11 reductions in SNF spending grew with longer ACO 
participation, and later entrants required more time to achieve reductions than early entrants. 
Reductions in spending on SNF care for ACO patients were due in part to lower use of 
inpatient care, in part to lower rates of discharge to SNFs, and in part to shorter length of

 SNF stays. Adjustment for the hospital or SNF to which patients were admitted revealed that 
reductions in SNF use and length of stay for ACO patients were largely due to within-
hospital changes in care specifically for ACO patients, as opposed to hospital-wide efforts, 
and to changes in care within SNFs for ACO patients, as opposed to use of different SNFs. 
Post-acute spending reductions were achieved without ostensibly compromising or 
improving quality of care for ACO patients, based on mortality, readmissions, and use of 
highly-rated SNFs.
Reductions in spending on SNF care associated with MSSP participation were statistically 
similar for independent physician groups and organizations financially integrated with 
hospitals, with higher estimates for independent groups contributing to their greater overall 
savings, as previously described.5,11 On one hand, financial integration with hospitals offers 
ACOs potential economies of scale for discharge planning and forming preferred SNF 
networks. On the other, hospitals in ACOs have weak incentives to pursue hospital-wide 
strategies to limit wasteful post-acute care because patients attributed under an 
organization’s ACO contract typically account for only a small proportion of admissions to 
the organization’s hospitals. Moreover, compared with hospital-integrated ACOs, ACOs that 
are independent physician groups report similar capacity for influencing inpatient care—and 
thus decisions about post-acute care at discharge—presumably by staffing admissions 
directly or using hospitalist groups or care managers to influence their patients’ inpatient 
care.10 Our results are consistent with ACOs using similar strategies to shorten length of 
SNF stays, such as employing or partnering with clinicians to follow patients in SNFs.
Thus, although hospitals may ostensibly be better positioned to influence post-acute care 
than physician groups, they may have limited financial incentives to develop strategies that 
differ from those available to physician groups.7 Incentives for hospitals in ACOs may 
change as bundled payment initiatives expand, but our results suggest that financial 
integration with hospitals is not necessary for ACOs to achieve sizable savings in the post-
acute setting. These findings in turn provide valuable information for clinicians considering 
employment changes to meet the challenges of payment reform and for practices trying to 
gauge their potential reach of influence and success under new payment models.
Our study also has important implications for Medicare payment policy and antitrust law 
enforcement. Under current and proposed payment programs that bundle acute and post-
acute care (e.g., the Bundled Payments for Care Improvement initiative), hospitals keep any 
savings within the bundle for patients attributed to an MSSP ACO.24,25 Because ACOs may 
be able to achieve post-acute savings independently, however, our results suggest that ACOs 
should keep some, if not all, of the savings in cases of overlap with bundled payment 
programs—ideally to the extent savings are attributable to ACO efforts. More generally, 
bundled payment programs that place hospitals at risk for post-acute spending may not be 
the only viable strategy to curb excessive post-acute care. Our findings also challenge claims 
by providers that mergers and acquisitions involving acute or post-acute facilities are 
necessary for achieving more efficient post-acute care under new payment models. More 
generally, the ability of ACOs to curb post-acute spending exemplifies the potential for 
providers to influence care across multiple settings without necessarily establishing common 
ownership over the full continuum of care, as few ACOs own SNFs.

 Our study has several limitations. First, the MSSP is a voluntary program and ACOs likely 
differ from non-participating providers. Post-acute spending levels and trends were similar 
for ACO and non-ACO providers during the pre-contract period, however, and we would not 
expect ACOs to lower use of post-acute care without an incentive to do so. Second, 
reductions in SNF use and length of stay for ACO patients conditional on hospital or SNF 
admission could have been due to differential changes in case mix resulting from reductions 
in hospital or SNF admissions. However, we found no evidence of differential changes in 
patient characteristics, consistent with hospital and SNF admission rates falling in 
proportion to patients’ risk of admission.26 Third, our analysis did not support inferences 
about substitution of post-acute settings. For example, our finding of lower use of post-acute 
facilities for ACO patients with no change in use of post-acute home health care could be 
due to both a substitution of post-acute home care for facility care and an accompanying 
reduction in both post-acute and outpatient home care for other patients, but our results 
reflect only the net effects.
CONCLUSION
Participation in the MSSP has been associated with significant reductions in post-acute 
spending without ostensible changes in quality, suggesting gains in health care value. Post-
acute spending reductions were more consistent with efforts by clinicians working within 
hospitals and SNFs to influence care for ACO patients than with hospital-wide initiatives by 
ACOs or use of preferred SNFs. Understanding such early successes can support regulatory 
policy that enhances rather than inhibits the effectiveness of payment and delivery system 
reforms.

 Figure. Differential Changes in SNF Spending in Post-contract Period by ACO Subgroup and 
Cohort, Admission-level Analysis
Differential changes in SNF spending in the post-acute period are displayed by ACO 
subgroup, with more negative estimates indicating greater spending reductions. Displayed 
subgroup estimates are for the pooled 2013–2014 post-contract period and are provided 
separately for the 2012 (blue) and 2013 (red) entry cohorts of MSSP ACOs, with the number 
of ACOs in each subgroup, overall and by cohort, provided in parentheses. Error bars 
indicate 95% confidence intervals. Overall, differential reductions in SNF spending for 
independent physician groups (differential change pooled across cohorts and 2013 and 2014: 
−$114; P=0.02) and organizations financially integrated with hospitals (−$67; P=0.003) 
were similar (P=0.38 for subgroup difference in estimates).

aMeans and percentages were adjusted for geography to reflect comparisons within hospital referral regions. There were no significant differential changes in patient characteristics for the 2014 ACO 
cohort, which are not shown. ZCTA denotes ZIP Code tabulation area. FPL denotes federal poverty level. DRG denotes diagnosis related group.
bPre-contract means are presented for years 2009–2011 for consistency, but in estimation of differential changes, the pre-contract period extended through 2012 for the 2013 cohort and through 2013 for the 
2014 cohort. Pre-contract means provide a basis for calculating differential changes as relative percentages.
cRace or ethnic group was determined from Medicare master beneficiary summary files.
dIndicates that disability was the original reason for Medicare eligibility.
eChronic conditions from the Chronic Conditions Data Warehouse (CCW) included 27 conditions: acute myocardial infarction, Alzheimer’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease and related disorders or senile 
dementia, anemia, asthma, atrial fibrillation, benign prostatic hyperplasia, chronic kidney disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, depression, diabetes, heart failure, hip/pelvic fracture, 
hyperlipidemia, hypertension, hypothyroidism, ischemic heart disease, osteoporosis, rheumatoid arthritis/osteoarthritis, stroke/transient ischemic attack, breast cancer, colorectal cancer, endometrial cancer, 
lung cancer, prostate cancer, cataracts, and glaucoma. Indicators for all 27 conditions were included in analytic models, as well as indicators of having multiple (≥2 through ≥9) conditions. Counts of 
conditions presented in the table include all conditions except cataracts and glaucoma.
fHierarchical Condition Categories (HCC) risk scores are derived from demographic and diagnostic data in Medicare enrollment and claims files, with higher scores indicating higher predicted spending in 
the subsequent year. For each beneficiary in each study year, we assessed the HCC score based on enrollment and claims data in the prior year.
gDRG payment weights, length of stay, and inpatient spending were used as additional measures to assess whether case mix for the admission-level and SNF stay-level analyses differentially changed as a 
result of differential changes in admission and SNF stay rates. For the analysis of SNF stays, these measures were assessed for the admission preceding each SNF stay.

aSNF denotes skilled nursing facility. IRF denotes inpatient rehabilitation facility. LTCH denotes long-term care hospital.
bInpatient facility spending did not include capital, disproportionate hospital, or indirect medical education payments. To adjust for between-hospital differences in Medicare payments for admissions in the 
same diagnosis-related group, we standardized inpatient facility spending by calculating a national mean payment for each DRG and summing mean payments across admissions for each beneficiary rather 
than actual Medicare payments. Estimates were not appreciably changed by this standardization.
