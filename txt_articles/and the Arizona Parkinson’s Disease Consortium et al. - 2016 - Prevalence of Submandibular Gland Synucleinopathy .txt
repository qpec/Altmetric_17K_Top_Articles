Abstract
BACKGROUND—Clinical misdiagnosis, particularly at early disease stages, is a roadblock to 
finding new therapies for Lewy body disorders. Biopsy of a peripheral site might provide 
improved diagnostic accuracy. Previously, we reported, from both autopsy and needle biopsy, a 
high prevalence of submandibular gland synucleinopathy in Parkinson’s disease (PD). Here, we 
report on an extension of these studies to subjects with dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and 
other Lewy body disorders in 228 autopsied subjects from the Arizona Study of Aging and 
Neurodegenerative Disorders.
OBJECTIVE—To provide an estimate of the prevalence of histological synucleinopathy in the 
submandibular glands of subjects with PD and other Lewy body disorders.
METHODS—Submandibular gland sections from autopsied subjects were stained with an 
immunohistochemical method for α-synuclein phosphorylated at serine 129. Included were 146 
cases with CNS Lewy-type synucleinopathy (LTS), composed of 46 PD, 28 DLB, 14 incidental 
Lewy body disease (ILBD), 33 Alzheimer’s disease with Lewy bodies (ADLB) and 2 with 
progressive supranuclear palsy and Lewy bodies (PSPLB). Control subjects included 79 normal 
elderly, 15 AD, 12 PSP, 2 corticobasal degeneration (CBD) and 2 multiple system atrophy (MSA).
RESULTS—Submandibular gland LTS was found in 42/47 (89%) of the PD subjects, 20/28 
(71%) DLB, 4/33 (12%) ADLB and 1/9 (11%) ILBD subjects but none of the 110 control subjects.
CONCLUSIONS—These results provide support for further clinical trials of in vivo 
submandibular gland diagnostic biopsy for PD and DLB. An accurate peripheral biopsy diagnosis 
would assist subject selection for clinical trials and could also be used to verify other biomarkers.

INTRODUCTION
The accuracy of the clinical diagnosis of Parkinson’s disease (PD) has been reported to 
range between 26% and 90% [1–6] with the higher accuracy figures being dependent on 
prolonged clinical observation and response to dopaminergic treatment. Misdiagnosis may 
occur in close to 50% of PD subjects who are within the first 5 years of symptom onset, even 
if responsive to dopaminergic medication [7]. The situation is even more problematic for 
dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), as only 15–25% of neuropathologically-defined DLB 
subjects are identified as DLB during life [8]. As early diagnosis and treatment of PD and 
DLB are likely to be more beneficial, especially for disease-modifying treatments, it is clear 
that poor clinical diagnostic accuracy is a critical roadblock to clinical trials and biomarker 
studies as these are heavily dependent on the clinical diagnosis. Additionally, for clinical 
trials utilizing invasive methods, such as pallidotomy, deep brain stimulation or neural 
transplantation [9–17], misdiagnosis exposes considerable numbers of subjects to potentially 
harmful procedures.
If the characteristic Lewy-type α-synucleinopathy (LTS) seen in the brains of these cases 
could be sensitively and reliably detected with a biopsy of peripheral tissue, this could 
improve clinical diagnostic accuracy, thereby facilitating clinical trials by allowing their 
performance with fewer subject numbers and lower cost. Additionally, biopsy could be used 
as the gold-standard diagnostic test to evaluate less-invasive candidate biomarkers. In a 
comprehensive survey of multiple organs and tissue types [18], we found LTS to be 
widespread throughout the peripheral nervous system (PNS) of subjects with PD and DLB, 
and to be detectable, although at much sparser densities and with a more restricted 
distribution, in less severe forms of Lewy body disorders such as incidental Lewy body 
disease (ILBD) and Alzheimer’s disease with Lewy bodies (ADLB). Our survey indicated 
that the PNS sites with the greatest LTS prevalences and densities were the paraspinal 
sympathetic ganglia, vagus nerve, submandibular gland and lower esophagus. Of these 
peripheral locations, the submandibular gland is the most accessible and safe to biopsy and 
we therefore have pursued additional studies [19], including two pilot clinical trials of 
submandibular gland needle biopsy in people with PD [20, 21].
Here, we report on a further extension of these studies in submandibular glands from 228 
autopsied subjects.

 Consortium. Brain necropsies and neuropathological examinations were performed on 
elderly subjects who had volunteered for the Arizona Study of Aging and Neurodegenerative 
Disorders/BSHRI Brain and Body Donation Program (BBDP) [22]. The BBDP has been 
approved by the designated BSHRI Institutional Review Board. The majority of BBDP 
subjects are clinically characterized at BSHRI with annual standardized test batteries that 
include movement disorders and neuropsychological components, including the Mini Mental 
State Examination (MMSE) and Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS). 
Additionally, private medical records are requisitioned and reviewed for each subject and a 
postmortem questionnaire is conducted with subject contacts to help determine the presence 
or absence of dementia and parkinsonism for those subjects that did not have a recent 
standardized antemortem evaluation.
Subjects received complete neuropathological examinations as described previously [23]. 
Specific consensus diagnostic criteria were used for PD [3,24], DLB and Alzheimer’s 
disease (AD). For the latter two conditions, cases received the diagnosis if they were 
classified as “intermediate” or “high” according to National Institute on Aging – Reagan 
Institute criteria for AD [25] or the Dementia with Lewy Bodies Consortium for DLB [26]. 
Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), corticobasal degeneration (CBD) and multiple system 
atrophy (MSA) were diagnosed according to conventional published criteria [27–37]. 
Subjects with AD or PSP who had LTS but did not otherwise meet diagnostic criteria for 
either PD or DLB were designated as AD with Lewy bodies (ADLB) or PSP with Lewy 
bodies (PSPLB). Subjects with LTS but who lacked dementia or parkinsonism were termed 
incidental Lewy body disease (ILBD).
Case selection was done by searching the BBDP database for all those that had died and had 
a full autopsy including submandibular gland evaluation with immunohistochemical staining 
for phosphorylated α-synuclein.
Histological methods
The process leading to the choice of immunohistochemical method has been described in a 
previous publication [38]. The usage of proteinase K not only results in superior epitope 
exposure but also may assist with the pathological specificity of the stain by digesting 
normal, non-aggregated α-synuclein. Using an antibody specific for α-synuclein 
phosphorylated at serine 129 [39–43] also helps identify stained structures as pathological 
since normal control subjects never have immunohistochemically-positive brain tissue 
elements [44,45]. Complete details of the staining procedure have been previously described 
[19] and so only a brief description is given here.
Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded 5–7 μm sections were deparaffinized and treated with 
1:100 proteinase K (Enzo Life Sciences, Farmingdale, NY) at 37° C for 20 minutes, 
followed by suppression of endogenous peroxidase activity with 1% hydrogen peroxide for 
30 minutes, incubation in primary antibody against α-synuclein phosphorylated at serine 
129, diluted 1:10,000 [40–43], incubation in biotinylated secondary antibody, avidin-biotin 
peroxidase complex (ABC, Vector Laboratories; Burlingame, CA) and 3,3′-
diaminobenzidine (DAB; Sigma, St. Louis, MO) with saturated nickel ammonium sulfate 
and imidazole. All solutions subsequent to proteinase K, and all wash steps, excluding DAB

 incubation, were carried out in 0.1 M PBS with 0.3% Triton X-100, pH 7.4. Sections were 
then counterstained in 1% Neutral Red. Positive neuronal perikarya and nerve fibers are 
bluish-black.
Two-color immunofluorescence was used to confirm the colocalization of LTS within axons. 
The same anti-phosphorylated α-synuclein antibody utilized for the single-label 
immunoperoxidase procedures was used in combination with an antibody against 
neurofilament (Abcam ab 7795, Cambridge, MA), along with goat anti-mouse IgG for 
neurofilament and goat anti-rabbit IgG for phosphorylated α-synuclein, fluorescently-
conjugated with Alexa Fluor 546 and 488, respectively (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). 
Sections were viewed with conventional fluorescence microscopy (Nikon Eclipse 80i 
fluorescent microscope equipped with a Digital Sight DS-Ri1 camera) and laser confocal 
microscopy (Leica DM-25 equipped with TCS SPE confocal).
Submandibular gland tissue processing and slide evaluation
Large (approximately 1.5 cm2) segments of submandibular gland from all study subjects 
were placed at autopsy into standard paraffin embedding cassettes and fixed in 10% neutral 
buffered formalin for two days at 4 degrees C, followed by 2 × 60 minutes changes in 50% 
ethanol, dehydration and paraffin embedding. Sections were cut at 6 μm and stained for α-
synuclein phosphorylated at serine 129 as described above. Submandibular gland sections 
were counted as positive for LTS only if stained elements had morphological features 
consistent with nerve fibers; occasionally the cytoplasm of serous gland cells or of 
extracellular secretion within gland contents were stained but this was regarded as non-
specific, based on a previous analysis [46]. Initially, only 1–3 sections were stained and 
examined. In 3 PD cases that were initially negative as well as in a subset of ADLB cases 
and all of the ILBD cases, additional sections were immunostained: Of the 3 PD cases, 1 of 
these had 2 80-μm-thick free-floating sections stained and examined while for the other 2 
cases, 4 additional paraffin sections were stained and examined for each case; all were 
positive on at least 1 of the additional sections. Nine ADLB cases had additional sections 
stained and examined. Of these, 5 had between 1 and 5 additional 80-μm-thick stained 
sections examined and 7 had an additional 4 stained paraffin sections examined (4 cases had 
extra sections of both types stained and examined); of these, 2 cases were positive on at least 
1 of the additional sections. One ILBD case had an additional 20 paraffin sections stained 
and examined whereas another 4 ILBD cases each had 10 additional paraffin sections 
stained and examined; none of the additional sections were positive. Of the normal control 
subjects, 23 had one section of submandibular gland stained while 28 had two sections 
stained and 28 more had three sections stained.
As for the brain regions, the densities of immunoreactive fibers were graded, at 400 × total 
magnification, at sites of maximum density as mild, moderate, severe and very severe, 
according to the templates published by the Dementia with Lewy Bodies Consortium [26].

 Statistical tests
Group means were compared with unpaired, 2-tailed t-tests. Groups of three or more were 
compared with one-way analysis of variance. Correlations were performed using 
Spearman’s method.
RESULTS
Description of diagnostic groups
Subjects with Lewy body disorders included 46 PD, 28 DLB, 9 ILBD, 33 ADLB and 2 
PSPLB (Table 1). Control subjects, defined as those without CNS LTS, included 79 normal 
elderly subjects, 15 AD (ADNLB), 12 PSP, 2 with CBD and 2 with MSA. The subjects were 
predominantly of advanced age, with the mean age ranges for the diagnostic groups falling 
between 73 (CBD) and 90 (PSPLB). Of the DLB cases, all except one also met diagnostic 
criteria for AD. The classification of cases with LTS according to the Unified Staging 
System for Lewy Body Disorders [43] is given in Table 2, along with the summary scores of 
brain regional LTS densities and submandibular gland LTS densities. The majority of DLB 
and PD subjects were Stage IV (Neocortical) and Stage III (Brainstem and Limbic), while 
ADLB and PSPLB subjects were mostly Stage IIb (Limbic Predominant) or Stage III, and 
ILBD subjects were distributed more evenly between Stages I (Olfactory Bulb Only), IIa 
(Brainstem Predominant), IIb and III. The summary of brain regional LTS density scores 
was approximately 2.5-fold higher for PD and DLB as compared to ILBD, ADLB or 
PSPLB. The median postmortem interval, for all subjects combined, was 3.1 hours and 
analysis of variance showed that there were no significant differences amongst groups.
Submandibular gland phosphorylated α-synuclein immunoreactivity
As in our previous investigations [18–21], only staining that was morphologically consistent 
with nerve fibers was considered to be specific for submandibular gland LTS. 
Immunoreactive nerve fibers were present within 42/46 PD subjects (91%), including 3 
cases with co-existing PD and PSP and one case with co-existing PD and CBD, 20/28 (71%) 
DLB subjects, including one with co-existing DLB and PSP, 4/33 (12%) ADLB subjects and 
1/9 (11%) ILBD subjects. No submandibular gland LTS was present in the 2 subjects with 
PSPLB and no LTS was found in the submandibular glands of the 110 non-LTS control 
subjects, including those classified as normal (without parkinsonism or dementia), AD, PSP, 
CBD or MSA. As previously reported [18, 20, 46], immunoreactive nerve fibers were most 
frequently found in nerve fascicles running in the connective tissue stroma (Figure 1A, C–F) 
but were also seen closely applied to the peripheral surface of small arteries (Figure 1B), or 
as single fibers interweaving amongst serous gland cells (Figure 1F). Immunoreactive nerve 
fibers were most often normal in appearance but occasional enlarged and distorted fibers 
were present.
In glands from some subjects in all diagnostic categories, the cytoplasm of some serous 
gland cells was positively stained (Figure 1H) and occasionally, secretory material within 
ducts was positively stained (not shown). As previously reported, [19] this type of staining is 
diagnostically non-specific as it was found in both control subjects as well as subjects with 
Lewy body disorders so was not counted as positive for LTS.

 Two-color immunofluorescence revealed presumptive LTS-containing axons running in 
parallel with neurofilament-immunoreactive axons within stromal nerve fascicles of subjects 
with DLB and ILBD (Figure 1, I–L). Merging of the two colors showed orange-colored 
fibers indicative of intra-axonal colocalization (Figure 1, K and L).
Statistical analyses
The differing prevalences of LTS in submandibular gland in different categories of Lewy 
body disorders suggests that the spread of LTS to submandibular gland is probabilistically 
related to total brain LTS load, as subjects with ILBD, ADLB and PSPLB, who have much 
lower total brain LTS loads (Table 2) also have much lower prevalences of submandibular 
gland LTS. Statistical testing confirmed this, as with all Lewy body disorders subjects 
combined, the mean brain LTS load was significantly higher in those with than those without 
submandibular gland LTS (means of 28.3 and 12.3; p < 0.0001).
The LTS density scores within the submandibular gland were significantly correlated, within 
the combined Lewy body disorder groups, with brain LTS total score (Spearman rho = 0.62; 
p < 0.0001) and UPDRS motor score (Spearman rho = 0.48; p < 0.0001), while there was no 
significant correlation with MMSE score.
Within the PD group, there were only 4 subjects lacking submandibular gland LTS, making 
it difficult to determine how LTS-negative subjects might differ from LTS positive ones. 
Despite the small group size, however, the LTS-negative group had a significantly shorter 
disease duration than the 41 subjects who were positive (means of 5.2 and 14.1 years; p = 
0.02). The correlation of disease duration with submandibular gland LTS density score was 
weak and missed the significance level (Spearman rho = 0.28; p = 0.07), suggesting that 
factors other than disease duration, perhaps disease severity, are important. In this respect, 
the submandibular gland LTS-negative PD group had a significantly lower brain LTS load 
(means of 21.7 and 28.3; p < 0.05).
Within the DLB category, subjects without submandibular gland LTS (N = 8) tended to have 
lower total brain LTS loads than subjects with submandibular LTS (N = 20); mean total brain 
LTS loads of those with (30.3) and without LTS (24.4) were not statistically significant in 
this small sample (p = 0.10). Disease duration did not differ between the two groups (means 
of 9.0 and 9.1 years, respectively).
DISCUSSION
The results of this investigation show that submandibular gland LTS is present in 91% of 
autopsy confirmed PD subjects, 71% of autopsied DLB, 12% of ADLB subjects, 11% of 
ILBD subjects but none of 2 with PSPLB. None of the 110 subjects without a brain-based 
Lewy body disorder had LTS in the submandibular gland.
This is the first reasonably comprehensive assessment of the prevalence of submandibular 
gland LTS in DLB subjects. We had previously reported LTS in 2 of 6 DLB subjects, based 
on single-section analysis within a body-wide survey [18]. In the present study we assessed 
multiple sections of submandibular gland (between 3 and 13) and found an LTS prevalence

 of 71%. This suggests that submandibular gland biopsy could improve diagnostic sensitivity 
for DLB, is a potential prognostic indicator, and/or could be used to validate other 
biomarkers. International consensus diagnostic criteria for dementia with Lewy bodies 
(DLB) were most recently updated in 2005 and define the characteristic clinical and 
neuropathological findings [26]. Despite this, a recent study of more than 30 National 
Institute on Aging Alzheimer’s Disease Centers found that only 15–25% of 
neuropathologically-defined DLB subjects were identified as DLB during life [8]. 
Dopaminergic functional imaging assists in the diagnosis of both PD and DLB, but does not 
separate them from other disorders characterized by a dopaminergic deficit [47, 48], 
including PSP, CBD and MSA, all of which, like PD and DLB, may be neuropathologically 
concurrent with AD. Until large, autopsy-confirmed studies of both diagnostic tests are 
performed, however, it is not possible to compare PET dopaminergic imaging with 
submandibular gland needle biopsy, in terms of diagnostic accuracy.
There is therefore an urgent need for sensitive and specific diagnostic biomarkers for DLB 
[5, 8, 26, 49–58] that are validated by histopathological examination. As it is costly and 
takes 2–3 years or more to assemble an adequate number of autopsied subjects, 
submandibular gland biopsy could be used directly as a biomarker in living subjects, or 
could provide a more expedient route to validate other biomarkers.
This confirms and extends previous reports of a high prevalence of submandibular gland 
LTS in PD subjects [19, 20, 45,59]. Biopsy of the submandibular gland could potentially 
provide a tissue-based and thus possibly more accurate diagnosis of PD. The study 
population had a mean disease duration of 13.4 yrs with a mean age of PD onset of about 65 
yrs. This cohort is therefore comparable to the general population of PD subjects. We 
reported two clinical trials of needle biopsy of the submandibular gland, in PD subjects with 
both long-duration and short-duration disease, finding submandibular gland LTS in 73–75% 
of subjects in both categories [20, 21].
This is the largest published investigation to date of submandibular gland LTS in ILBD 
subjects. In our prior work [18] we had found none of 3 ILBD subjects to have 
submandibular gland LTS while one other group reported LTS in 2 of 3 subjects [59]. In this 
current work we have added an additional 6 ILBD subjects and found LTS in only 1 of the 9. 
There is an urgent need to find biomarkers of PD that are detectable prior to the onset of 
motor signs and symptoms but it appears that submandibular gland biopsy will not fulfill 
this need as the sensitivity is too low, at least using current methods. This relative 
insensitivity to ILBD, however, makes submandibular gland biopsy more useful for 
distinguishing PD and DLB from asymptomatic Lewy body disease, which is present in up 
to 25% or more of the elderly population [43]. If ILBD cases, which are 10–25% of the 
normal elderly population, frequently had submandibular gland LTS, then a positive needle 
biopsy of the gland would not necessarily be diagnostic of PD or DLB, it could merely 
indicate the presence of ILBD in a subject without nigral LTS, and hence a different 
underlying disorder, not PD or DLB. At present it is unknown what fraction of ILBD would 
ultimately become symptomatic, either as PD or DLB, but it is likely to be a small fraction, 
given that the estimated prevalences of PD and DLB in the elderly are much smaller than 
that of ILBD. The relatively low apparent rate of conversion of ILBD to PD or DLB may be

 due to the advanced age of most ILBD subjects. All subjects with Lewy body disorders must 
pass through an ILBD phase, however. Despite the apparently low conversion of ILBD to 
PD or DLB, it would appear that ILBD is not a completely benign condition, as it is 
associated with an approximately 50% decrease in striatal dopaminergic markers as well as 
the clinical biomarker of hyposmia [60–63].
Submandibular gland LTS was uncommon in subjects with ADLB, being present in only 4 
of 33 subjects. ADLB is a diagnosis of exclusion, consisting of subjects meeting 
clinicopathological criteria for AD but lacking sufficient brain LTS spread and density to 
qualify for the diagnosis of DLB [25], and/or lacking a predementia presentation with 
parkinsonism. It is remarkable that up to 60% of subjects with AD have brain LTS [43,64]. 
The database of the Arizona Study of Aging and Neurodegenerative Disorders [22] currently 
has 673 neuropathologically-confirmed AD cases with a full brain examination for LTS. Of 
these, 391 (58.1%) have brain LTS, with 100 (14.8%) meeting DLB clinicopathological 
criteria, 60 meeting PD clinicopathological criteria and 231 classified as ADLB. Given the 
high population prevalence of AD, ADLB is probably the second most common Lewy body 
disorder (after ILBD). Although ADLB has attracted little attention from the research 
community, its regional brain LTS distribution suggests that a subset of ADLB cases 
represent early-stage DLB [43] and it appears likely that DLB subjects pass through the 
ADLB stage.
As LTS is likely to be widespread within the peripheral autonomic nervous system, other 
sites might be considered for peripheral biopsy diagnosis of Lewy body disorders. Our wide-
ranging survey of multiple body locations, however, indicated that the lower esophagus and 
submandibular gland had the highest prevalences of LTS in subjects with Lewy body 
disorders [18]. We chose to pursue further studies in the submandibular gland as we thought 
it would be the least invasive site to biopsy. Needle biopsy has been extensively used to 
investigate submandibular gland neoplasms [65]. Other salivary glands, including the parotid 
gland, sublingual glands and minor (labial) salivary glands, might also be considered as 
potential biopsy sites. Of these, the parotid gland, while easily accessible, has the greatest 
risk of side effects due to the proximity of the facial nerve and the possibility of facial 
disfigurement. The sublingual glands have not yet been investigated. Three studies have 
determined LTS prevalence in the minor salivary glands, with 2 studies reporting a very low 
prevalence (1/15 cases positive in one study and 3/16 in a second study) [19, 66] while the 
other study found 2/3 were positive [67].
A critical question has been whether or not LTS begins in the brain or within elements of the 
peripheral nervous system [69–71]. The present results, as well as our previous reports 
[18,19], do not support the concept that the initiation of LTS is in the peripheral nervous 
system rather than the brain. The stimulus for this intriguing hypothesis has come largely 
from clinical studies of PD that have found a wide range of non-motor signs and symptoms 
that accompany the disease [72]. Many of these non-motor accompaniments are related to 
dysfunction of the peripheral autonomic system. These may predate or occur early in the 
motor progression [73–77]. The description of Lewy bodies within the sympathetic and 
parasympathetic ganglia, adrenal medulla and selected GI tract regions within autopsied 
subjects with PD and DLB [78–82] has shown that peripheral nervous system LTS is

 certainly present but there has been insufficient data regarding the findings in prodromal 
phases of disease. Autopsy studies of relatively small numbers of subjects with ILBD have 
demonstrated a high prevalence of LTS within the spinal cord, sympathetic ganglia, adrenal 
medulla and upper GI tract [18,78,79,84–87] but no study to date has found LTS in the 
spinal cord or in peripheral nervous system sites in the absence of brain involvement, with 
the possible exception of Fumimura et al [82] who reported one case out of 783 with adrenal 
medulla as the only site with LTS. One other case report exists of Lewy body pathology 
restricted to the heart and stellate ganglion [88]. The present work is in agreement with these 
prior studies as, of the 79 normal elderly subjects without brain LTS, none had 
submandibular gland LTS. Additionally, none of the 31 other subjects lacking brain LTS 
were positive for submandibular gland LTS. It would therefore appear that α-
synucleinopathy likely begins in the CNS and spreads both rostrally and caudally. Given the 
frequency of isolated LTS in the olfactory bulb of ILBD cases, the initial onset may well be 
in the olfactory bulb.
In conclusion, we report here submandibular gland LTS prevalence rates of 91%, 71%, 12% 
and 11%, respectively, in autopsy-confirmed subjects with PD, DLB, ADLB and ILBD. 
Needle biopsy of the submandibular gland may prove to be useful as a diagnostic and/or 
progression biomarker in PD and DLB, and may provide an expeditious means with which 
to validate other potential biomarkers of these conditions. Further biopsy studies of larger 
numbers of subjects are needed. We have had unpublished confirmation of a positive LTS 
immunohistochemical signal in close to 90% of autopsied PD submandibular gland and 
absence from controls, from two separate, independent laboratories using different primary 
antibodies and signal development methods (personal communication, Wagner Zago, 
Prothena Biosciences, Inc.). These were small subject sets, however (less than 30 total 
subjects) and therefore further confirmation is needed. This may be forthcoming shortly, as 
the Michael J Fox Foundation has just started a multi-center clinical trial of submandibular 
gland needle biopsy, as well as sigmoid colon and skin biopsy, in 60 PD subjects and 20 
controls. Additionally, it should be noted that several studies have investigated the minor 
salivary glands [89–91], with conflicting results, while multiple other peripheral biopsy sites 
[92–95] have been suggested for diagnosing PD and/or DLB; all of these latter, however, are 
single-center studies and will require independent replication.

 Figure 1. 
Photomicrographs of sections stained immunohistochemically for phosphorylated α-
synuclein. A) Low magnification of gland from a PD subject with immunoreactive fibers in 
the stroma around some large ducts. B) Low magnification of gland from a DLB subject 
with immunoreactive fibers at the periphery of a small artery in the stroma. C – E) Low, 
medium and high magnification of gland from an ILBD subject with immunoreactive fibers 
running within nerve fascicles in the stroma. F) High magnification of single 
immunoreactive nerve fibers amongst serous gland cells in a PD subject. G) High 
magnification of gland from a DLB subject with a single immunoreactive fiber in the 
stroma. H) High magnification of immunoperoxidase reaction product within the cytoplasm 
of serous gland cells in the submandibular gland of a subject with PD. This type of staining 
was seen in control subjects as well as in subjects with Lewy body disorders and is therefore 
considered diagnostically non-specific. I and J) High magnification of a nerve fascicle in the 
gland stroma of a DLB subject, stained with an immunofluorescent method for 
neurofilament (I, red) and phosphorylated α-synuclein (J, green) and viewed using a 
fluorescence microscope. K) Medium magnification of a nerve fascicle in the gland stroma 
of an ILBD subject, stained with an immunofluorescent method for neurofilament (red) and 
phosphorylated α-synuclein (green) and viewed with a confocal laser microscope. L) High 
magnification of a nerve fascicle in the gland stroma of an ILBD subject, stained with an 
immunofluorescent method for neurofilament (red) and phosphorylated α-synuclein (green) 
and viewed with a confocal laser microscope. Merged fibers are orange.

Table 1
General characteristics of the study subjects, by neuropathologic diagnosis, age, gender, last MMSE score, last motor UPDRS score, Braak neurofibrillary 
stage and CERAD neuritic plaque (NP) density. Three PSP cases and one CBD case also had PD while one PSP case also had DLB and two other PSP 
cases had brain LTS but not meeting diagnostic criteria for either PD or DLB; all these mixed pathology cases are listed with their Lewy body disorders 
group only. Means and standard deviations (SD) are given. ILBD = incidental Lewy body disease; PD = Parkinson’s disease; PSP = progressive 
supranuclear palsy without LTS; PSPLB = progressive supranuclear palsy with Lewy bodies; CBD = corticobasal degeneration; MSA = multiple system 
atrophy; ADLB = Alzheimer’s disease with Lewy bodies; ADNLB = Alzheimer’s disease with no Lewy bodies; NP = neuritic plaque; N/A = not 
applicable.

Classification of subjects according to their brain distribution of phosphorylated α-synuclein Lewy-type synucleinopathy (LTS) and the Unified Staging 
System for Lewy Body Disorders. Number of subjects in each stage are given, along with the mean (SD) summary LTS density score for 10 standard 
brain regions. One PD subject was not classifiable due to missing brain regions needed for staging; 3 PD subjects did not have summary brain scores due 
to missing regions; 6 ADLB subjects did not have summary brain scores due to missing regions; one DLB subject was not classifiable due to missing 
brain regions needed for staging; 4 DLB subjects did not have summary brain scores due to missing regions;. ILBD = incidental Lewy body disease; PD = 
Parkinson’s disease; ADLB = Alzheimer’s disease with Lewy bodies; PSPLB = progressive supranuclear palsy with Lewy bodies.
