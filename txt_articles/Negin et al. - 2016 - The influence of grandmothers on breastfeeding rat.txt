The influence of grandmothers on
breastfeeding rates: a systematic review
Joel Negin*, Jenna Coffman, Pavle Vizintin and Camille Raynes-Greenow
Abstract
Background: Exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months of an infant’s life has enormous potential to reduce
mortality and morbidity. The older generation, particularly the infant’s grandmothers, play a central role in various
aspects of pregnancy and child rearing decision-making within the family unit. This is particularly true in low- and
middle-income countries where older women are seen as owners of traditional knowledge. Despite this, most
health programs target the individual person most directly involved in the target behaviour – usually new
mothers – without a commensurate understanding of who else influences those decisions. In this systematic review
we aim to quantify the impact of the grandmother on influencing a mother’s breastfeeding practices.
Methods: We conducted a systematic review using Web of Science, Scopus, and Medline databases using search
terms for grandmother and breastfeeding. Eligible studies reported on the duration of exclusive breastfeeding
and included estimates of effect of a grandmother’s influence including whether or not the grandmother
lived with the infant’s family, the grandmother’s education, and the grandmother’s attitudes towards and prior
experience with breastfeeding.
Results: We identified 568 articles and, after review, 13 articles were assessed as meeting the selection criteria. They
were conducted in both developed and developing countries and included cross-sectional surveys, prospective cohort
studies and one randomised controlled trial. Eight studies examined the effects of attitudes or experiences of older
generations with respect to breastfeeding and five of the eight found a significant positive impact on breastfeeding
when grandmothers of the infants had had their own breastfeeding experience or were positively inclined towards
breastfeeding, resulting in effects of between 1.6 to 12.4 times more likely to exclusively breastfeed or refrain from
introducing solid foods. A Chinese study however found that highly educated grandmothers were associated with
decreased exclusive breastfeeding. The majority of the studies were assessed to be of weak or moderate quality.
Conclusions: This review found evidence that demonstrates that grandmothers have the capacity to influence
exclusive breastfeeding. Programs that seek to influence exclusive breastfeeding should include grandmothers in
their interventions to achieve maximum impact.

Background
Exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months of an
infant’s life has the greatest potential to reduce mortality
of all preventive interventions with an estimated potential
to avert over 800,000 deaths, or 13 % of all deaths in
children under five in the developing world [1–3]. Not
only does exclusive breastfeeding have the potential to dir-
ectly avert deaths in children under-five, but evidence also
suggests that it has an indirect protective effect against
gastrointestinal infections, respiratory infections, allergic
diseases and non-transmissible chronic diseases that ap-
pear later in life, such as obesity, diabetes, Crohn’s disease,
and lymphoma [4]. Despite the clear benefits and numer-
ous public health campaigns to promote breastfeeding, ex-
clusive breastfeeding rates are low. According to UNICEF,
the global average of exclusive breastfeeding in infants
under six months of age is 41 %, with the lowest rate in
low- and middle-income countries being 25 % in the West
and Central Africa region [5]. High income countries have

 even lower rates of exclusive breastfeeding: in the United
States, only 16 % of infants are exclusively breastfed at six
months [6] and, in Australia, only 15 % at five months [7].
Breastfeeding rates are influenced by a myriad of fac-
tors spanning from sociocultural to economic. Literature
suggests that the older generation, particularly the
infant’s grandmothers (either the maternal mother or
the paternal mother), play a central role in various as-
pects of pregnancy decision-making and child rearing
within the family unit [8–10]. This is particularly true in
low- and middle-income countries. For example, in
Tanzania, a study found that paternal grandmothers
considered themselves responsible for all family health
care
issues
and
actively
discouraged
prevention
of
mother-to-child HIV transmission practices [11]. Simi-
larly, a Nepalese study among mothers-in-law noted that
they “see themselves as key providers of, and decision-
makers in, perinatal care practices” [12]. A female
respondent in a Ghanaian study on stated that she would
only go to the clinic if her baby was sick with “my
mother-in-law’s permission” [13]. Within certain contexts,
evidence indicates that this influence can be particularly
deleterious to exclusive breastfeeding rates. A 2012 study
from Nigeria, found that paternal grandmothers pressured
25 % of the mothers enrolled in the study to not exclu-
sively breastfeed [14].
In many societies around the world, older women are
seen as owners of traditional knowledge and cultural
history which has strong community significance [15].
Despite this influence, the older generation has not been
a specific area of study in the field of global health [16].
Most health programs target the individual person most
directly involved in the target behaviour – usually new
mothers [17, 18] – without a commensurate understand-
ing of who else influences those decisions.
In this systematic review we aim to quantify the impact
of the grandmother on influencing a mother’s breastfeeding
practices.
Methods
We adhered to the PRISMA guidelines for systematic
reviews
[19].
The
search
terms
“mother-in-law”,
“mothers-in-law”, “grandmother” and “grandmothers”
were combined with the terms “breastfeeding” and
“breast-feeding” and entered into the Web of Science,
Scopus, and Medline databases.
We defined grandmothers as the mother of either the
mother or the father of the infant whose feeding
outcome is being measured. We defined (exclusive)
breastfeeding according to the WHO’s definition of
exclusive breast feeding as “no other food or drink, not
even water.” Eligible studies reported on the duration of
exclusive breastfeeding. Eligible studies also included
estimates of effect of a grandmother of the infant’s
duration of exclusive breastfeeding, and included a
sample size greater than 50 – studies under this size did
not have the power to detect a difference in rates. Quali-
tative studies were excluded. We limited the search to
publications in English from 1995 until 2014 to leverage
20 years of evidence since the target implementation
date of UNICEF’s [20].
In the first review round, two reviewers (PV, JC)
independently scrutinised the list of article titles and
eliminated the clearly non-relevant titles. Another round
of exclusions using abstracts of those titles deemed
potentially relevant was conducted and the final selec-
tion was based on the full text of potentially relevant
abstracts. In cases of disagreement, a third reviewer (JN)
examined
the
articles.
Results
and
inclusion
were
discussed until consensus was reached among all three
reviewers.
Data were then extracted from each relevant study
into an excel spreadsheet. Extracted information in-
cluded year, location of study, brief description, study
type, sample size, study population, review of methods,
primary outcome measure and focus topic of the study.
Quality was assessed according to the Effective Public
Health Practice Project Quality Assessment Tool for
Quantitative Studies [21] which gives a rating from
between ‘poor’ to ‘strong’ based on a range of criteria
including selection bias, study design, confounders,
blinding,
data
collection
methods,
withdrawals
and
drop-outs, intervention integrity and analyses. The tool
has been assessed for validity and reliability and was
recommended for use by Deeks and colleagues [22].
The reported measure of effect (e.g. odds ratio, hazard
ratio) from each study was used to compare across studies
with the same type of measurement. Diverse elements of
grandmother
influence
were
assessed
including
co-
habitation status (whether or not the grandmother lived
with the infant’s family), the grandmother’s education, and
the grandmother’s attitudes towards and prior experience
with breastfeeding. For each element of influence, a
narrative synthesis is provided. Figures are provided to
show the effect of the grandmother. Figures are presented
separately by measure of effect and data is not combined
across studies.
Ethical approval was not required for this study.
Results
The searches yielded 568 journal articles in total (Fig. 1).
Following
the
removal
of
duplicates,
176
articles
remained, of which 155 were potentially relevant based
on a review of the title. A further 124 articles were ex-
cluded from an abstract review; 7 articles had a sample
population of less than 50; 4 articles were not in English;
50 were unrelated to either breastfeeding or the influence
of grandmothers; and 62 were either small qualitative

 studies or narratives. Of the 31 potentially relevant
abstracts, 13 articles were included after full-text review
due to inclusion of estimates of effect which could be
compared across studies (Fig. 1).
Once the 13 articles to be included in the review were
determined we performed a quality analysis using the
Effective Public Health Practice Project Quality Assess-
ment Tool for Quantitative Studies [21]. Two reviewers
independently assessed each study according to the
Quality
Assessment
Tool
and
then
discussed
and
reviewed until consensus of the final quality assessment.
Thirteen studies were included (Table 1). The stud-
ies were conducted in a range of countries, which in-
cluded both low and high-income countries. Of these,
there were eight cross-sectional surveys [23–29], four
prospective cohort studies [4, 30–32] and one rando-
mised controlled trial [33]. Studies included a range
of time points of exclusive breastfeeding from one
week to six months. Of the thirteen studies, eight
assessed the impact the grandmother has on breast-
feeding rates and duration due to her attitude to or
experience
of
breastfeeding
[23–26,
28–31].
Two
studies assessed the impact on breastfeeding rates and
duration when the grandmother was the main child-
care taker [27, 32]. One study assessed the impact the
grandmother’s education level had on breastfeeding
rates and duration.
The included studies used a variety of measures of
effect including odds ratios, relative risks and hazard
ratios. Two studies used relative risk as the measure of
effect, eight studies used odds ratios, and three studies
used hazard ratios, therefore we were unable to calculate
an overall effect size. The majority of the studies were of
weak or moderate quality, according to the Effective
Public Health Practice Project Quality Assessment Tool
for Quantitative Studies [21].
The types of influences grandmothers had on breast-
feeding differed from study to study, as some measured
the older generation’s personal experience with breast-
feeding, whilst others measured their attitudes towards
breastfeeding. Of the 13 studies examined in this review,
eight examined the effects of attitudes or experiences of
grandmothers with respect to breastfeeding [23–29, 31].
A majority of these (five of eight) found that there was a
significant
positive
impact
on
breastfeeding
when
grandmothers
of
the
infants
had
had
their
own
breastfeeding experience or were positively inclined
towards breastfeeding, resulting in effects of between 1.6
to 12.4 times more likely to exclusively breastfeed or re-
frain from introducing solid foods (Fig. 2) [23–26, 29].
Two studies found no significant effect on breastfeeding
rates from grandmothers who had positive attitudes to
breastfeeding [28, 32].
Three of the thirteen studies reported negative impacts
of grandmothers on breastfeeding. Kohlhuber et al. [30]
found within a sample population in Germany, if a mater-
nal grandmother had a negative attitude towards breast-
feeding, the mother was up to 3.62 (95 % CI 2.26,5.81)
times more likely not to initiate breastfeeding after birth.
Similarly, Susin et al. [31] found that when the maternal
grandmother advised giving the infant water or tea, the
mother was 2.22 (95 % CI 1.5, 3.30) times more likely to
abandon exclusive breastfeeding by the end of the first
month. Li et al [27] found that if the grandmother was the
primary caretaker of the infant, the mother was up to 4.3
(95 % CI 1.85-10.10) times more likely to practice non-
exclusive breastfeeding (Fig. 3).
Of the 13 studies included in this review, there was
only one study that involved a randomised controlled
trial. Nunes et al. [33] investigated the effect of an
intervention aimed at grandmothers and adolescents
to reduce tea and water intake of infants less than six

 months of age in Brazil. The study measured the
introduction of water and/or herbal teas over the first
six months of the infants’ life among two groups; co-
habiting grandmothers and mothers, and mothers and
grandmothers that did not live together. There was a
reduced
chance
of
exclusive
breastfeeding
among
women who cohabited with grandmothers than those
who lived apart from their grandmothers.
Findings from other studies investigating the impact of
cohabitation with grandmothers on exclusive breastfeed-
ing are less clear. Susin et al. [31] investigated the
frequency of contact of grandmothers with mothers, but
did not find that grandmothers had a significant influence
on breastfeeding, irrespective of the length of contact with
mothers (Fig. 4a). Similarly, Santo et al. [4] investigated
the impact of the maternal compared to the paternal
grandmother cohabitating with the mother on exclusive
breastfeeding. The study did not find a significant influ-
ence of cohabitation with either grandmother upon
breastfeeding (Fig. 4b).
Only one study specifically examined the impact of the
grandmother’s educational level on exclusive breastfeed-
ing. Liu et al. [34] compared grandmothers with a formal
education compared to no formal education and found
that mothers were significantly less likely to exclusively
breastfeed if the grandmothers were educated. Liu sug-
gests that the fact that highly educated grandmothers
were associated with decreased exclusive breastfeeding
may
reflect
the
relationship
between
better
family
socioeconomic status and preference to formula feed
due to formula being seen as indicative of higher socio-
economic status.

 Discussion
This review found evidence that demonstrates that grand-
mothers have the capacity to influence exclusive breast-
feeding. Although there were differences in the type of
breastfeeding outcome and how the grandmothers influ-
ence was measured, the overall effect on breastfeeding
was positive when the older female generations’ attitudes
towards or experiences with breastfeeding was favourable
towards breastfeeding. A grandmother’s positive breast-
feeding opinion had the potential to influence a mother
up to 12 % more likely to initiate breastfeeding. Con-
versely a negative opinion has the capacity to decrease the
likelihood of breastfeeding by up to 70 %.
Whilst this review has shown that the grandmother
can have a significant impact on exclusive breastfeeding,
there is still insufficient research on this topic to

 empirically state to what extent their impact has and
what other factors contribute to their influence. The im-
pact of cohabitation with grandmothers on the breast-
feeding rates of mothers was unclear in the two studies
that investigated this factor. The associations between
duration of contact between the grandmother and
mother and breastfeeding rates were not statistically
significant, as was the association of cohabitation with
either maternal or paternal grandmothers. As both stud-
ies took place in a similar region within Brazil, to infer
that cohabitation has no effect on breastfeeding rates
would ignore the potential for an effect to exist within
other contexts.
One of the key limitations of this study is the difficulty
in accurately comparing the studies due to the hetero-
geneity of the effect measurements used. The authors
did attempt to mitigate this problem by contacting a
number of authors in order to obtain the original data
from each study; however, we did not receive any
correspondence.
Another major limitation of this study, therefore, is
the cross-cultural generalisability of these findings. Expe-
riences of mothers being influenced by the infant’s
grandmother in a high-income country such as the
United States might be dramatically different from a
country with a lower income such as Pakistan [35–37].
The finding by Liu et al. that mothers that had a grand-
mother with an education were less likely to exclusively
breastfeed may have more to do with the country-
specific, highly targeted infant formula advertising in
China, rather than an effect of education itself [38].
Furthermore, cultural and socioeconomic differences in
ethnic groups within the same country would have the
potential to have different influences on breastfeeding
practices. For example, Yoruba and Edo communities in
Nigeria tend to consider exclusive breastfeeding hazard-
ous to an infant’s health, whilst other communities
might not share the same beliefs [39].
Conclusion
This review suggests that grandmothers can have an influ-
ence in one of the most important health behaviours.
Results of this review suggest that female members of the
older generation exert influence on breastfeeding, and
researchers and program developers can use these find-
ings to include this influence in their own intervention or
a

 program developments. Some commentators have started
to acknowledge this need. One notes that “programs must
be sensitive to social expectations… and involve mothers-
in-law… in counselling of mothers who intend to practice
[exclusive breastfeeding]” [40] and another states that
“managers of communications campaigns should consider
directly targeting mothers-in-law to increase their support
for the use of family planning” [41].
The lack of attention to mothers-in-law in global
health fits in to a larger reality of the neglect of older
adults by the global health community. Global health
funding and practice has largely focused on mothers and
children at the expense of not just men [42] but, even
more so, older adults [43, 44]. This represents a gap in glo-
bal health practice and health promotion in particular. Of
greater concern is the suggestion that the perspectives of
older women are met with derision by some health
workers which has the potential of only consolidating their
traditional practices and rejection of new practices [15].
There are, however, recent research projects that take
a more inclusive approach. An ongoing Indian rando-
mised controlled trial has involved mothers-in-law in
efforts to reduce domestic violence [45]. Programmes in-
volving the older generation focused on breastfeeding
could have an important impact. Engaging older women
with health messages can improve their own health out-
comes, those of their daughters and daughters-in-law as
well as their grandchildren. Very few public health inter-
ventions can claim such cross-generational impact.
