Background: Food allergy prevalence is reported to be
increasing, but epidemiological data using patients’ electronic
health records (EHRs) remain sparse.
Objective: We sought to determine the prevalence of food
allergy and intolerance documented in the EHR allergy module.
Methods: Using allergy data from a large health care
organization’s EHR between 2000 and 2013, we determined the
prevalence of food allergy and intolerance by sex, racial/ethnic
group,andallergengroup.Weexaminedtheprevalenceofreactions
that were potentially IgE-mediated and anaphylactic. Data were
validated using radioallergosorbent test and ImmunoCAP results,
when available, for patients with reported peanut allergy.
Results: Among 2.7 million patients, we identified 97,482
patients (3.6%) with 1 or more food allergies or intolerances
(mean, 1.4 6 0.1). The prevalence of food allergy and
intolerance was higher in females (4.2% vs 2.9%; P < .001) and
Asians (4.3% vs 3.6%; P < .001). The most common food
allergen groups were shellfish (0.9%), fruit or vegetable (0.7%),
dairy (0.5%), and peanut (0.5%). Of the 103,659 identified
reactions to foods, 48.1% were potentially IgE-mediated
(affecting 50.8% of food allergy or intolerance patients) and
15.9% were anaphylactic. About 20% of patients with reported
peanut allergy had a radioallergosorbent test/ImmunoCAP
performed, of which 57.3% had an IgE level of grade 3 or
higher.
Conclusions: Our findings are consistent with previously
validated methods for studying food allergy, suggesting that the
EHR’s allergy module has the potential to be used for clinical and
epidemiological research. The spectrum of severity observed with
food allergy highlights the critical need for more allergy
evaluations. (J Allergy Clin Immunol 2017;140:1587-91.)

The prevalence of adverse reactions to food in the United States
in 2014 was estimated to be 5% for adults and 8% for children,1 an
increase from 2006 estimates (3% to 4% and 6%, respectively).2
Reports over the last decade indicate that the incidence of
food-induced hospitalizations in the United States increased
from 0.6 per 1000 patients to 1.3 per 1000 patients.3
However, most studies reporting food allergy epidemiology use
cross-sectional surveys, a method often limited by small sample
size and selection bias. In addition, many studies focus on a
specific food allergen or allergen group, most commonly peanut,
tree nut, or shellfish.4-6 Current electronic health record (EHR)
systems in the United States contain an ‘‘allergy’’ module in
which health care providers document a patient’s adverse
reactions to medications, foods, or environmental substances,
including reactions reported by the patient or observed clinically.
This module must include food allergies to ensure patient safety,
especially for hospitalized patients. The EHR allergy module also
serves as the only semi-standardized location for allergy
documentation between EHRs and enables population-based
estimates of food allergy epidemiology.
In this study, we used the EHR allergy module of a large health
care system to estimate the prevalence of food allergies and

METHODS
Setting and data collection
In this study, we used food allergy and intolerance data collected at Partners
HealthCare, an integrated health care delivery network in the Greater Boston
Area composed of multiple community and specialty hospitals as well as
community health centers. Partners HealthCare providers recorded patient
food allergies and intolerances in an allergy module of the EHR. Patients’
allergy information was integrated and stored in the Partners’ Enterprise-wide
Allergy Repository (PEAR).7 In this article, we use the term ‘‘food allergies
and intolerances’’ to represent any adverse reaction to food, including
allergies, idiosyncratic and pseudoallergic reactions, intolerances, and even
food preferences.8-10 The study population consisted of patients seen at any
Partners HealthCare center from January 1, 2000, to December 31, 2013.
This study was approved by the Partners HealthCare Human Research
Committee.
Food allergy and intolerance information in PEAR included a list of
specific allergens (ie, culprit foods), reaction(s) to that allergen, and associated
data (date/time this information was recorded and any updated information
such as new/different reactions). Patients’ demographic information (sex, date
of birth, and self-reported racial/ethnic group) was extracted from the Partners
HealthCare EHR. As described in a previous study,10 food allergy and
intolerance records were processed by a natural language processing tool to
the coded form, negated terms were removed, and food allergens were
classified into groups. Classification was based on the Food Allergen Labeling
and
Consumer
Protection
Act,11
cross-sensitivity
findings,
medical
terminologies (eg, Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine – Clinical
Terms12), recommendations of a multidisciplinary expert panel, and a review
of the allergy literature.10 The final food allergen classification consisted of 19
food substance groups.
Patients’ adverse reactions associated with food allergens were captured
and classified by reaction type (eg, hives/urticaria and anaphylaxis). These
adverse reactions represented both patient self-reported adverse reactions to
food and physician-recorded symptoms to food. We defined potentially
IgE-mediated reactions as those that included anaphylaxis, shortness of
breath, tongue swelling, hives/urticaria, itching, bronchospasm/wheezing,
angioedema, and hypotension.13,14 We classified anaphylactic reactions as
only those reactions entered as anaphylaxis by the clinical provider (eg, a
patient with reactions of shortness of breath and hives would not have been
considered anaphylaxis).
To better understand the validity of food allergy data entered in PEAR, we
used specific IgE to peanut by radioallergosorbent test (RAST) from 2000 to
2010 and ImmunoCAP from 2009 to 2013 for all patients reportedly peanut
allergic or intolerant.
Data analysis
We determined food allergy and intolerance prevalence to each of the
19 food allergen groups, as well as by sex and racial/ethnic group
(white, black, Hispanic, Asian, and ‘‘other or unknown’’). ‘‘Other or
unknown’’ racial/ethnic group included those with more than 1 racial
identity
and
patients
whose
racial/ethnic
group
was
‘‘not
given,’’
‘‘unknown,’’ ‘‘refused,’’ or missing. We calculated the prevalence of
common (frequency, >1.0%) reactions among patients with 1 or more
food allergies or intolerances.
We validated EHR-reported peanut allergies by identifying patients with a
documented allergy or intolerance to peanut who had a RAST/ImmunoCAP
performed in our health care system, and assessing the grade by IgE level
(negative, <0.35 mg/dL; grade 1, 0.35-0.69 mg/dL; grade 2, 0.70-3.49 mg/dL;
grade 3, 3.50-17.49 mg/dL; grade 4, 17.50-49.99 mg/dL; grade 5,
50.0-100.0 mg/dL; and grade 6, >100.0 mg/dL). We performed the corollary
analysis using only those patients with reported peanut allergies whom we
identified as potentially IgE-mediated.
We used chi-square tests to compare documented food allergies and
intolerances in each demographic group for all food allergies and intolerances
and for each allergen group. For multigroup categories (eg, race), we collapsed
each group into binary variables for statistical comparisons. P values were
calculated, with P < .05 being considered statistically significant. Data were
analyzed using SAS statistical software version 9.3 (SAS Inc, Cary, NC).
RESULTS
Description of study population
Our overall study population (ie, the PEAR data set) consisted
of 2,714,851 patients of whom 55.2% were females and 44.8%
were males. Most of our patients were white (70.5%), followed by
Hispanic (6.3%), black (5.7%), and Asian (3.6%).
Prevalence of documented food allergy and
intolerance
A total of 132,734 food allergy and intolerance records were
documented for 97,482 (3.6%) food-allergic or intolerant
patients. On average, patients with food allergy and/or intolerance
had 1.4 6 0.1 food allergen records in PEAR. The most prevalent
food allergen groups (P < .001) were shellfish (0.9%), fruit or
vegetable (0.7%), dairy (0.5%), peanut (0.5%), and tree nut
(0.4%) (Table I; see Table E1 in this article’s Online Repository
at www.jacionline.org).
Female patients were more likely to have a recorded food allergy
or intolerance than males, both overall (4.2% vs 2.9%; P < .001)
and for every food allergen group except peanut (0.4% for females
vs 0.5% for males; P < .001). Asian patients (4.3%) had a
significantly (P < .001) higher prevalence compared with other
racial/ethnic groups (3.6%), followed by black patients (3.9%),
white patients (3.8%), and Hispanic patients (2.8%). Among the
9 most common food allergen groups, Asian patients had
significantly higher food allergy and intolerance prevalence for
all groups except additives (Asian 0.1% vs non-Asian 0.2%;
P < .001) and grain (Asian 0.2% vs non-Asian 0.3%; P < .001)
(Tables I and E1).
Food adverse reactions
Among 132,734 allergy and intolerance records, there were
148,046 documented reactions experienced by 97,482 patients.
Seventy percent of the reactions had 1 or more known adverse
reaction
documented
(ie,
they
were
not
documented
as
‘‘unknown’’), accounting for 103,659 reactions. On average,
patients had 1.2 reactions (when known) for each unique food
allergen. A total of 28.3% of patients with a documented food
allergy or intolerance had a reaction of hives/urticaria, followed
by anaphylaxis (15.9%) and gastrointestinal irritation (11.5%).
A total of 50.8% of patients with a food allergy or intolerance had
a corresponding documented reaction that was potentially
IgE-mediated (Table II).

Among
patients
with
a

(23.2%) weregrade 2, 149 (10.7%) weregrade 3, 264 (19.0%) were
grade 4, 183 (13.2%) were grade 5, and 206 (14.8%) were grade 6.
DISCUSSION
We assessed more than 2.7 million patients and identified
132,734 food allergy and intolerance records over 13 years for
97,482 unique patients. Using the EHR allergy module, we
identified a 3.6% prevalence of food allergy and intolerance, a
figure largely consistent with previous estimates using oral food
challenges (OFCs),1,15 and slightly lower than those using
self-reported surveys.6,16 The latter would be expected because
exclusive reliance on patient self-reporting can overestimate
food allergy prevalence.17 The overall consistency of these
findings with previous knowledge derived from different data
sources suggests that data documented in the EHR allergy section
have the potential to be used for clinical and epidemiological
research in food allergy.
Consistent with most previous studies, we found that females
are
more
likely
to
have
documented
food
allergies
or
intolerances,6,16,18 but that peanut allergies or intolerances were
more common in males.4,18 This sex difference may be due to
the overall high prevalence of allergic diseases among females,
but alternately may be due to higher rates of awareness and
reporting.19 The higher prevalence documented among Asians
was similar to that in previous studies in Western nations,3,20
but higher than that reported among Asian nations and
Asian-born immigrants.21 This inconsistency may be partially
attributable to the different preparation of peanuts; in Asian
countries peanuts are primarily boiled whereas in Western
countries they are roasted, a preparation that increases the
allergenicity of the peanut.22 Taken together, these findings
suggest contributing genetic, cultural, and/or environmental
influences.
Food allergy can be morbid23 and costly; it has been estimated
to cost the United States almost $25 billion annually.24 Examining
allergic reactions to food among children, Gupta et al20 found that
almost 40% of children suffered a severe reaction (defined as
anaphylaxis, low blood pressure, trouble breathing, or wheezing
and a combination of vomiting, angioedema, and coughing).
We found that approximately 50% of documented reactions
were potentially IgE-mediated (affecting almost 2% of our entire
population), with anaphylaxis comprising almost 16% of

 reactions. The latter finding may have actually been an
underestimate of the true burden of food-induced anaphylaxis
because we used a conservative definition of anaphylaxis that
did not redefine reactions as anaphylaxis for patients who
experienced 2 or more reactions that met the National Institutes
of Allergy and Infectious Disease/Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis
Network anaphylaxis criteria.25 This study not only highlights the
spectrum of severity observed with food allergy but also identifies
the critical need for more allergists/immunologists. With fewer
than 7000 allergists/immunologists in the United States,26 even
in the greater Boston area, we do not have the capacity to evaluate
all these patients for confirmatory testing. Indeed, availability of
allergists/immunologists is likely one contributory reason why
specific IgE to peanut was performed in only 1 in 5 patients
with EHR report of peanut allergy or intolerance in this study.
Yet, confirmatory testing is useful to identify causative allergens,
receive appropriate counseling, and avoid unnecessary anxiety
about future food reactions or expenses in finding allergy-free
alternative foods.
This analysis has several limitations. PEAR data include
unverified allergies, intolerances, and other adverse reactions to
foods.10 Many records in PEAR may be inaccurate due to patient
self-reporting and food preference. At Partners HealthCare,
allergy specialists generally do not document allergy skin test
results, specific IgE results, or the results of OFC in PEAR.10
This is because of both practice patterns and the lack of
designated space for these important allergy details in the EHR.
In working with allergy specialists, patient safety experts, and
informaticians, we envisioned a more useful allergy module
that included both subjective and objective allergy signs
and symptoms, with results of skin tests, specific IgE via
RAST/ImmunoCAP, and OFC.27,28 Yet, about 1 in 5 patients
with EHR allergy module listing of peanut allergy or intolerance
had a specific IgE to peanut sent in this health care system, and of
those sent among patients with potentially IgE-mediated peanut
allergy, most patients (58%) had an IgE value suggestive of true
allergy (ie, grade 3 or higher).29 Another limitation is that
prevalence may be overestimated because of increased patient
awareness of food allergy and intolerance, with increased
awareness leading to increased reporting of food allergies by all
or certain demographic groups (eg, females). In addition, the
quality of the allergy entries in the EHR depends on the
knowledge of health care providers entering/verifying the
information; fortunately, most PEAR allergies are entered by
medical doctors.30 Last, our large health care system in
Massachusetts may not be representative of other regions because
food allergy has been shown to differ by geographic region—with
generally higher estimates in New England31 and in urban areas.32
Our covered population includes 2 large tertiary care referral
centers that may include more patients with severe allergies
than the general population. In addition, we report on a population
that is predominately white, as New England is 82.4% white33
compared with only 63.7% for the United States34 generally.
In conclusion, this study represents one of the largest
EHR-based reports of food allergy and intolerance and offers
insight into the substantial burden of food allergy and intolerance.
We found a food allergy and intolerance prevalence of 3.6%, with
increased prevalence among woman and Asians. We identified
that IgE-mediated reactions constituted half of all documented
adverse reactions to foods, with a report of anaphylaxis in 1 in 6
reactions. These findings support the pressing need for more
food
allergy
evaluations,
as
well
as
a
call
for
more
allergists/immunologists, especially given new recommendations
for early food introductions, less reliance on isolated positive test
results,35-38 and more aggressive use of OFC to diagnose food
allergy. Last, our findings support that the EHR allergy module
may be helpful in determining the epidemiology and risk factors
for food allergy, as well as identifying patients for prospective
clinical studies and/or food allergy evaluations.

*Percentage is prevalence of food allergy among the entire study population or that specific demographic category.
�Fungus includes cultivated mushrooms, yeast, truffles, and portobello mushrooms.10
�Legume is defined as members of the legume family (eg, bean, chickpea, snow pea, red bean, and kidney bean), except peanut and soy, which are categorized into separate groups, on the basis of previous cross-sensitivity studies.10
§Extract includes types of edible cooking oils (eg, olive oil) as well as other extracts (eg, annatto, and yeast extract).10
jjInfant formula includes infant formulas (eg, Enfamil, Prosobee, Lipil, Similac, Elecare Powder, Nutramigen, and Enfacare) as well as breast milk and baby food.10 Although the true allergen may be dairy or soy, this was not able to be
determined.
{Nutritional supplements include dietary supplements (eg, Ensure, Duocal, red yeast, and fiber).10
#All food allergen groups in this table were significantly (P < .05) more prevalent among women than among men, except for infant formula.
**Asian patients had a significantly (P < .05) higher prevalence than did the other racial/ethnic groups for soy, alcohol, and legume. White patients had a significantly (P <.05) higher prevalence than did the other racial/ethnic groups for
seed, fungus, spice, and extract. Hispanic patients had a significantly (P < .05) higher prevalence than did the other racial/ethnic groups for meat.
