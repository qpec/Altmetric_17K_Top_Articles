Epigenetic control of enhancers alters neuronal functions and may be involved in Alzheimer’s
disease (AD). Here, we identify enhancers in neurons contributing to AD by comprehensive
fine-mapping of DNA methylation at enhancers, genome-wide. We examine 1.2 million CpG
and CpH sites in enhancers in prefrontal cortex neurons of individuals with no/mild, mod-
erate, and severe AD pathology (n = 101). We identify 1224 differentially methylated
enhancer regions; most of which are hypomethylated at CpH sites in AD neurons. CpH
methylation losses occur in normal aging neurons, but are accelerated in AD. Integration of
epigenetic and transcriptomic data demonstrates a pro-apoptotic reactivation of the cell cycle
in post-mitotic AD neurons. Furthermore, AD neurons have a large cluster of significantly
hypomethylated enhancers in the DSCAML1 gene that targets BACE1. Hypomethylation of
these enhancers in AD is associated with an upregulation of BACE1 transcripts and an
increase in amyloid plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and cognitive decline.

1234567890():,;
 A
lzheimer’s disease (AD) is an age-dependent chronic
neurodegenerative disorder that is clinically characterized
by the progressive deterioration of memory and cognitive
functions. It is the leading cause of dementia, affecting 50 million
people worldwide1,2. The primary neuropathological signs of AD
are intraneuronal neurofibrillary tangles and extracellular β-
amyloid (Aβ) plaques, along with accompanying synaptic and
neuronal loss2. In general, the distribution of neurofibrillary
tangles in the AD brain follows a stereotypic pattern; beginning in
the entorhinal/perirhinal cortex, progressing to limbic structures
including the hippocampus, and then finally spreading neo-
cortically across the frontal, temporal, and parietal cortex3. Loss
of neurons and severity of cognitive impairments in AD corre-
spond closely with the burden of tangle pathology4,5. The neu-
rodegenerative process is also mediated by excessive production
and accumulation of Aβ peptides forming plaques. Generation of
pathogenic Aβ peptides requires β-secretase (BACE1), which
cleaves amyloid precursor protein (APP); the rate-limiting step
in Aβ production6. Synaptic dysfunction in AD, which is evident
long before substantial neuronal loss7, has been attributed to
elevated BACE1 levels prompting the overproduction of toxic Aβ
at synaptic terminals6,8. Recently, it has been demonstrated
that Aβ plaques create an environment that enhances the
aggregation of tau, which in turn forms intracellular neurofi-
brillary tangles9–11. Consequently, Aβ and neurofibrillary tangles
jointly cooperate in the progression of AD4,9,12. However, AD is
not a normal part of aging and the biological mechanisms causing
some individuals, but not others, to develop disease pathology
remain unclear.
The majority of AD is sporadic (>95%) in which aging is the
strongest
non-modifiable
disease
risk
factor.
Epigenetic
mechanisms could contribute to AD, as many manifestations of
aging, including age-dependent diseases, have an epigenetic
basis13,14. Epigenetic marks like DNA methylation regulate gene
transcription13, are responsive to environmental changes15, and
show widespread remodeling during aging16,17. DNA methyla-
tion sites that robustly predict chronological age exhibit acceler-
ated aging changes in the AD brain17,18, though these predictive
sites have not been linked to specific effector genes. Moreover, in
epigenome-wide studies, DNA methylation abnormalities iden-
tified in the AD brain are frequently located outside of gene
promoters (and CpG islands)14,19,20. This begs the question of
how do DNA methylation changes exert a pathogenic role in AD?
DNA methylation patterns controlling transcriptomic changes
with age were recently found to prominently affect enhancer reg-
ulatory elements21. Enhancers are genomic elements that modulate
the complex spatial and temporal expression of genes, and are
subject to epigenetic regulation13,22. Enhancers, for the most part,
are cis-acting and cell-type-specific, and often located outside of
their target gene13. In the brain, epigenetically-controlled enhancers
enable neuronal differentiation, experience-dependent gene tran-
scription, and neuroplasticity23–25. Prior genome-wide studies
examining DNA methylation changes in the AD brain report a
significant overlap between differential methylation and enhancer
elements14,19, suggesting that epigenetic disruption of enhancer
function contributes to AD. However, the assay platform used in
these prior studies primarily focused on CpG sites in coding regions
(exons) and CpG islands14,19,20,26, and consequently, the majority
of enhancer regions have yet to be examined in AD. In addition,
CpG sites are not the sole location at which DNA methylation
occurs. In human neurons, a large proportion of methylation
occurs at non-CpG sites (CpH)27, yet the role of these non-
canonical methylation sites in AD is unknown. Hence, in this study
we perform a genome-wide analysis of DNA methylation, exam-
ining both CpG and CpH sites, at enhancers in neurons from AD
brain. Our study, that specifically examines neurons, reveals novel
gene regulatory regions involved in AD, and most importantly,
provides insight into the mechanisms involved in AD pathogenesis.
Results
Differentially methylated enhancer regions in AD neurons. In
order to identify enhancers involved in AD, we comprehensively
mapped DNA methylation at enhancers, genome-wide, in neu-
rons isolated from the prefrontal cortex of 101 individuals with
no/mild, moderate and severe AD pathology (Braak stage: 1–2
n = 38 individuals, 3–4 n = 32, and 5–6 n = 31 individuals,
respectively; Supplementary Table 1). We first isolated neuronal
nuclei
using
an
established
antibody
(NeuN+)
and
flow
cytometry-based approach (Supplementary Fig. 1). We then fine-
mapped DNA methylation at enhancer elements using a targeted
bisulfite sequencing strategy, known as bisulfite padlock probe
sequencing. For this, we designed 59,009 padlock probes covering
all brain enhancers defined by the NIH Epigenomics Roadmap
(active, poised/bivalent, weak, and genic enhancers; ChromHMM
18-state model). This padlock probe library also included brain
promoters, since many act as enhancers28. In total, we examined
1,207,507 modified cytosines (122,071 CpGs and 1,085,436
CpHs) at 29,132 regulatory regions across the genome (Supple-
mentary Fig. 2). We confirmed that % CpH methylation levels in
our data were as previously reported29 and that there was not a
selective neuronal subtype loss in the AD prefrontal cortex
(Supplementary Figs. 2d, 3).
Our analyses focused on identifying differentially methylated
enhancers associated with Braak stage, a standard measure of
neurofibrillary tangle burden3. Braak stages 1–2 (transentorhinal),
3–4 (limbic), and 5–6 (neocortical) typically refers to unaffected
individuals/clinically silent, incipient AD, and fully developed
AD, respectively3. In our samples, clinical diagnosis of AD
correlated closely with neurofibrillary tangle burden (Pearson’s
correlation R = 0.78; p < 10−15), as expected4,5. In this analysis,
we
first
identified
differentially
methylated
cytosine
sites
(individual CpGs and CpHs) corresponding to the severity of
tangle pathology (Braak stage), after controlling for age, sex,
postmortem interval as well as neuronal subtype; the proportion
of
glutamate
to
GABAergic
neurons
in
each
sample,
as
determined by neuronal subtype deconvolution (Supplementary
Fig. 3). There were 13 differentially methylated cytosines in AD
neurons at q < 0.05 (robust linear regression model; Supplemen-
tary Table 2). We then parsed the targeted genome into regions
(cytosines within 1000 bp; average region size: 261.5 ± 3.2 bp),
and searched for regulatory regions with a significant enrichment
of top 10% differentially methylated cytosines in AD neurons.
There were 1224 regions showing differential methylation with
increasing neurofibrillary tangle pathology (q < 0.05, robust linear
regression model followed by hypergeometric test; Fig. 1a;
Supplementary Data 1). Most epigenetically perturbed regulatory
regions in AD neurons were hypomethylated (76.06%; 931 out of
1224 regions), and located far from any transcription start sites
(TSS) in intergenic and exonic areas (average 50.5 ± 2.0 kb from a
TSS; Supplementary Fig. 4), supporting a prevalent enhancer
contribution to AD. Super-enhancers, which are clusters of
enhancers that are magnitudes larger than common enhancers
and help specify cell fate30, were not significantly overrepresented
in the differentially methylated AD enhancers (p = 0.73, hyper-
geometric test). Transcription factor (TF) motif analysis showed
that the ETS family, were most strongly overrepresented at the
differentially methylated enhancers (p < 10−18, binomial distribu-
tion model in oPOSSUM; Fig. 1b); this TF family has a role in cell
differentiation, cell cycle control, and apoptosis31.
We also examined the relative contribution of CpH sites to AD.
In total, there were 5.8-fold more differentially methylated CpH

 sites (especially CpA) in AD enhancers than CpG sites (16,264
CpHs and 2803 CpGs; 1.49 and 2.30% of CpH and CpG sites
tested, respectively; Fig. 1c). DNA methylation differences were
on average larger at CpG sites (3.74% ± 0.05) than CpH (0.98% ±
0.01; p < 10−15, Welch’s t-test). Hence, CpH methylation is labile
and together with CpG methylation is an important contributor
to enhancer misregulation in AD neurons.
One of the most significantly disrupted regulatory elements in
AD neurons was an enhancer located in intron 3 of the
DSCAML1 gene (chr11: 117,504,514–117,506,898; 1.56% hypo-
methylation in AD; q < 10−14, robust linear regression model
followed by hypergeometric test; Fig. 1d, e). In fact, DSCAML1
intron 3 contained the highest concentration of DNA methylation
abnormalities in AD neurons affecting a total of 16 enhancers
with cumulatively 304 significantly disrupted CpG/CpH sites in
this 235.7 kb genomic area (0.62%–5.25% hypomethylation in
AD; q < 0.05 to 10−14, robust linear regression model followed by
hypergeometric
test;
Fig.
1d).
These
enhancer
regions
in
DSCAML1 intron 3 were all hypomethylated. This suggests that
epigenetically activated enhancers in DSCAML1 may have an
important role in the progression of neurofibrillary tangle
pathology and AD.
Next, we identified regulatory elements that were epigenetically
altered prior to the arrival of neurofibrillary tangle pathology in
neurons of the prefrontal cortex (Braak stage 1–4). There were
626 regulatory regions exhibiting significant DNA methylation
changes (q < 0.05, robust linear regression model and hypergeo-
metric test; Supplementary Data 1). Most notably, DSCAML1
intron 3 contained 5 enhancers showing DNA hypomethylation
occurring early in AD (0.70 ± 0.12% hypomethylation in AD; q <
0.05, robust linear regression model and hypergeometric test;
Fig. 1d and Supplementary Fig. 5). Therefore, in prefrontal cortex
neurons, hypomethylation of enhancers at DSCAML1 precedes
the onset of neurofibrillary tangle pathology.
Gene targets of epigenetically misregulated enhancers in AD.
For enhancers to stimulate gene expression, the spatial config-
uration of the chromatin must bring enhancers in close proximity
to their target gene promoters22,32. DNA methylation status at
enhancers is an important determinant of enhancer–promoter
interactions32, signifying that DNA methylation abnormalities at
enhancers affect their ability to activate their cognate gene pro-
moters. To uncover the gene targets of the epigenetically dysre-
gulated elements in AD neurons, we investigated the 3D
chromatin architecture in neurons. Using an in situ Hi-C dataset
generated from human prefrontal cortex33, we found that our
AD-relevant enhancer regions interacted with 1942 promoter
regions (±2 kb from TSS), affecting 1207 genes (Fig. 2a; Supple-
mentary Data 2). Enhancers disrupted in AD neurons were found
to act in cis for all target promoters, with an average of 1.94 ± 0.11

 promoters interacting with each enhancer. To maximize the
identification of local interactions, we also used an in silico cis-
regulatory region prediction tool to determine proximal genes
associated with the AD enhancers. In total, 2431 genes were
found to be potentially altered by aberrant DNA methylation at
enhancers in AD neurons (Supplementary Data 1). Genes
showing enhancer hypomethylation included the tau kinases:
MAPK10 (JNK3), MARK3, CAMK2A, CAMK2B DYRK1A, and
the CDK5 neuronal activator CDK5R2 (p39) and CDK5RAP2,
which when overexpressed induces the hyperphosphorylation of
tau that forms neurofibrillary tangles34,35.
We further examined the role of the genes with promoters
targeted by the differentially methylated enhancers in AD
neurons. Pathway analysis, using MetaCore, revealed a significant
disruption of pathways involved in neurogenesis and neurodeve-
lopment in AD (q < 0.05, hypergeometric distribution; Fig. 2b). In
addition, amyloid neuropathies, dementia, and brain illnesses
consisted of 8 of top 10 disease pathways (q < 0.05, hypergeo-
metric distribution; Fig. 2c). Finally, genes with differentially
methylated enhancers significantly converged with proteomic
changes found in cortical neurons of AD patients captured by
laser microdissection36. There were 109 genes with both an
epigenetic disruption of their enhancer(s) and a protein change in
AD cortical neurons (genes identified in the two datasets
significantly overlapped, p < 10−5, hypergeometric test; Supple-
mentary Fig. 6), indicative that there are functional consequences
of aberrant DNA methylation at enhancers in AD neurons.
Given the extent of epigenetic disruption at enhancers in
DSCAML1 intron 3, we used the Hi-C dataset of prefrontal cortex
to explore chromatin interactions in this genomic area. We found
that enhancers in DSCAML1 interacted with the BACE1 gene
promoter (Fig. 2d). Consequently, hypomethylation of these
enhancers in neurons may underlie the overexpression of BACE1
involved in AD pathophysiology6.
We also examined whether epigenetically misregulated enhan-
cers in AD neurons were located near genetic polymorphisms
(SNPs) identified in a large GWAS meta-analysis of AD. We first
determined the linkage disequilibrium (LD) block (R2 > 0.8) for
each of the 21 significantly associated AD SNPs (GWAS p < 10−8;

 differentially methylated in AD neurons directly overlapped these
LD blocks. However, chromatin conformation analysis using the
Hi-C dataset from prefrontal cortex demonstrated that three
genes previously identified in GWAS had differentially methy-
lated enhancers in AD neurons. These genes were: BIN1, SORL1,
and MEF2C (Supplementary Table 3). Additionally, we ran a
linear regression that compared the results of the entire AD
GWAS (IGAP)37 and our DNA methylation study, adjusting for
LD score. Our epigenomic study of enhancers in AD neurons had
a significant positive correlation with AD GWAS (p < 0.01, linear
regression). Thus, there are genes with both a genetic and
epigenetic disruption in neurons that may contribute to AD.
Transcriptional changes in genes with enhancer malfunction.
We performed a transcriptomic analysis to further explore the
effects of epigenetic alterations at enhancers in AD. RNA-
sequencing (RNA-seq) was conducted on a subset of prefrontal
cortex samples (n = 25 individuals) previously examined in our
epigenetic
investigation.
Our
analysis
identified
1049
genes
demonstrating differential expression with increasing neurofi-
brillary tangle pathology, after controlling for age, sex, postmortem
interval, RNA quality (RIN), as well as neuronal variation (as
determined by cell-type deconvolution; q < 0.05, robust linear
regression model; Supplementary Data 3; Supplementary Fig. 7).
We then determined whether enhancers exhibiting DNA methy-
lation changes with AD pathology had corresponding changes in
expression of their target genes. For this, we correlated enhancer
DNA methylation change with increasing Braak stage to respective
mRNA change with increasing Braak stage, adjusting for covariates
(sex, age, postmortem interval, neuronal proportion, and for RNA-
seq data RIN). We found that AD-associated enhancers exhibited
DNA methylation changes with AD pathology that were inversely
correlated to changes in target gene expression with AD pathology
(p < 0.001, Pearson’s correlation; Supplementary Fig. 7c). We also
examined whether differentially methylated enhancer regions in AD
had a significant enrichment of differentially expressed enhancer
RNAs (eRNAs) in AD. Using our RNA-seq data, we identified
2,563 brain enhancers with detectable eRNAs levels, of which 36
were differentially expressed in AD (q < 0.05, robust linear regres-
sion model; Supplementary Table 4). There was a significant
enrichment of differentially expressed eRNAs at AD-associated
enhancer regions (p < 0.05, hypergeometric test). This suggests that
enhancers involved in AD exhibit corresponding differences in
mRNA and eRNA levels with AD, though further analysis is
required to fully explore eRNA changes in the AD brain.
Next, we integrated our epigenetic and transcriptomic dataset in
a network analysis and found two major hubs converging on UBC
and CUL3, which included APP as a subnetwork hub (Fig. 3;
Supplementary Fig. 8). Pathway analysis of each hub showed an
enrichment of 1) early cell cycle (G0–G1–S phase) and inflamma-
tion; and 2) amyloid neuropathies and signal transduction (Fig. 3;
Supplementary Tables 5, 6; q < 0.05, hypergeometric distribution).
To validate our findings we examined a large RNA-seq dataset
of the prefrontal cortex of AD patients and controls (n = 338
individuals) generated by the Religious Orders Study and
Memory and Aging Project (ROSMAP)38. In this dataset, we
found 1478 genes with differential expression corresponding to
neurofibrillary tangle burden, after correcting for age, sex,
postmortem interval, years of education, RIN, and neuron
proportion (q < 0.05, robust linear regression model). There were
102 genes exhibiting significant transcriptional differences in the
AD prefrontal cortex in both the ROSMAP and our dataset
(differentially expressed genes in the two datasets significantly
overlapped; p < 0.05, hypergeometric test; Supplementary Table 7),
supporting the involvement of these genes in AD.
The ROSMAP38 also performed a DNA methylation analysis
in the AD prefrontal cortex using 450K Illumina arrays. Though
array coverage is sparse in DSCAML1 intron 3 (22 CpG sites),
there was one CpG (cg07533617) located at an enhancer found to
target BACE1 in our Hi-C analysis. Loss of DNA methylation at
this DSCAML1 CpG site was significantly associated with elevated
BACE1 mRNA expression in early stage AD pathology (Braak
stage ≤ 4; p < 0.005, robust linear regression model; Fig. 4a).
BACE1 mRNA levels were no longer associated with DSCAML1
methylation in late stage AD pathology (Braak stage 5–6; Fig. 4a).
Likewise, correlation analysis between our DNA methylation and
RNA-seq data (n = 25 individuals) supports that DNA methyla-
tion in this DSCAML1 enhancer targeting BACE1 influences
BACE1 mRNA levels (q < 0.05, robust linear regression model;
Supplementary Fig. 9; Supplementary Table 8).
Moreover, in the ROSMAP data, we found that hypomethyla-
tion of the enhancer CpG site (cg07533617) in the DSCAML1
intron 3 corresponded to an increased in amyloid plaque load,
neurofibrillary tangle density, and a worsening of cognitive
symptoms (p < 0.05, robust linear regression model for neuro-
pathology and linear mixed model for cognitive symptoms;
Fig. 4b). In particular, loss of DNA methylation at the DSCAML1
CpG site was associated with the rate of decline in episodic
memory, perceptual speed, and global cognitive function (p <
0.05, linear mixed model). Likewise, decreased DNA methylation
across DSCAML1 intron 3 (average of 22 CpGs) correlated with
elevated BACE1 mRNA expression in early AD (p < 0.001, robust
linear regression model) and a rapid progression of cognitive
symptoms (decline in perceptual speed; p < 0.05, linear mixed
model; Supplementary Fig. 10). Therefore, an independent
dataset supports that DSCAML1 hypomethylation in AD neurons
is associated with increased BACE1 expression, which contributes
to the development of AD pathology and symptoms.
Genetic evidence for DSCAML1 enhancer regulation of
BACE1. To further determine whether enhancers in DSCAML1
impact BACE1 expression in the brain, we examined the con-
sequences of cis-acting genetic variation on BACE1 gene
expression (±500 kb area centered on BACE1 and encompassing
DSCAML1). For this, we used SNP information (n = 5533 SNPs
determined by genome-wide arrays and imputation) and BACE1
mRNA levels in the prefrontal cortex (determined by RNA-seq)
of controls and AD patients from the ROSMAP study (n = 278
individuals). Our analysis identified 53 haplotypes in the exten-
ded BACE1 genomic area, and examined their relationship to
BACE1 expression, after controlling for sex, age, postmortem
interval, years of education, Braak stage, RIN, and neuronal
proportion (Supplementary Data 4). We found two haplotypes
within DSCAML1 intron 3 (chr11: 117,569,792–117,585,343;
chr11: 117,596,846–117,640,659) influencing variability in BACE1
expression (q < 10−4, robust linear regression model; Fig. 5;
Supplementary Fig. 11), as well as another three haplotypes near
the BACE1 TSS (q < 0.05, robust linear regression model; chr11:
117,180,496–117,190,785; chr11: 117,215,360–117,231,907; chr11:
117,236,649–117,244,826). The two haplotypes in DSCAML1
intron 3 linked to BACE1 expression overlapped 4 enhancers that
were hypomethylated in AD neurons. This supports that
enhancers in DSCAML1 are directly involved in BACE1 regula-
tion, and thereby may contribute to the development of AD
pathology and symptoms.
Epigenetic changes at enhancers contribute to aging. Advanced
age is universally considered to be the most salient risk factor for
AD2. Why aging is the strongest risk factor for AD is not
well understood, particularly at a mechanistic level. Previous

 whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) analysis of DNA
methylation in healthy prefrontal cortex neurons demonstrated
that CpH methylation, but not CpG methylation, dramatically
rises in early life, coinciding with the period of synaptogenesis
and brain maturation27. We therefore investigated whether CpH
methylation sites in AD enhancers exhibits age-dependent
changes in later life to promote the development of AD.
First, we confirmed that there is an increase in CpH methylation
in AD-associated enhancers in neurons during early life. Using a
WGBS dataset of healthy human prefrontal cortex neurons27, we
found that between infancy and adulthood there was a 2.01-fold
increase in CpH methylation at AD enhancers in neurons, which
then remained stable during middle age, as previously reported27
(Supplementary Fig. 12). We next examined the aging dynamics of
CpH in our cohort of older adults (54–105-years-old), focusing on
3,661 CpH methylation sites across 848 enhancers found most
relevant to AD in the epigenetic and transcriptomic integration
analysis (Fig. 3). We found that in neurons of the prefrontal cortex,
CpH methylation significantly changed with age, after controlling
for sex, postmortem interval, Braak stage, and neuron subtype
proportion (p < 10−3, robust linear regression model). However,
epigenetic aging differed depending on severity of AD pathology. In
neurons of healthy individuals, CpH methylation steadily declined
with age (Braak stage 1–2; 1.50% hypomethylation; p < 0.005, robust
linear regression model; Fig. 6a); an effect that was less evident in
moderate AD (Braak 3–4, p = 0.16, robust linear regression model).
However in neurons of individuals with advanced AD (Braak stage
5–6, p = 0.46, robust linear regression model) CpH methylation had
already reached a low level and no longer changed with age in older
adults (Fig. 6a).
We then asked whether the lack of decline in CpH methylation
in severe AD neurons was due to an acceleration in epigenetic
aging. To test this, we used the epigenetic clock, which uses DNA
methylation patterns to evaluate divergences between biological
and chronological aging17. With this model, we used our
enhancer CpH sites from healthy individuals (Braak stage 1–2)
to predict the age of advanced AD cases (Braak stage 5–6). We
found that neurons of advanced AD cases have a significant
3.67 ± 1.61 year acceleration in DNA methylation aging (81.87 ±
1.42 years for chronological age vs 85.54 ± 0.70 years for predicted
biological age; p < 0.05, paired t-test; n = 31 individuals; Fig. 6b).
Interestingly, though chronological age varied in advanced AD
(range: 63–96 years-old), the neurons of nearly all these cases
exhibited an epigenetic age exceeding 80-years-old (Fig. 6c).
Therefore, healthy and AD neurons exhibit differential epigenetic
aging. In healthy neurons, CpH methylation at enhancers
increase in early life, and then subsequently decrease with
advanced age. However, AD neurons experience an accelerated
loss of CpH methylation at enhancers, and as a result are
epigenetically old.
Discussion
Our highly detailed deep-sequencing maps capturing both
CpG and CpH sites at enhancer and promoter elements in neu-
rons of AD patients and controls serves as a rich resource for
exploring disrupted gene regulation in AD neurons. First, we
demonstrated widespread epigenetic abnormalities at enhancers
in AD neurons that largely involved the loss of CpH methylation,
most frequently at CpA sites. CpH methylation is as effective as
CpG methylation in repressing gene transcription and is depleted
in active enhancers and promoters39,40, signifying that loss of
CpH methylation at enhancers in AD typically represents an
activation of target genes. Second, we find that genes with epi-
genetically disrupted enhancers in AD significantly converge on

 transcriptomic changes observed both in our sample cohort and
those of a large, independent study (and also strongly overlaps
proteomics abnormalities in AD neurons). Integration of our
omic datasets supports that AD neurons exhibit abnormal cell
cycle reentry, and have an overstimulation of apoptotic and
inflammatory pathways. Third, we identified enhancers respon-
sible for BACE1 overexpression in AD neurons, and provided a
molecular link between excessive Aβ production and the pro-
gression of neurofibrillary tangle pathology. Finally, we demon-
strate that in aging neurons of older adults, there is a loss of
CpH methylation at enhancers, which when accelerated may
progress AD. Together, our study supports that epigenetic dys-
regulation of enhancers occurs early in AD neurons, and disrupts
the activity of key genes involved in the pathological onset and
progression of AD.

prominently
affected genes involved in neurogenesis pathways. In early life,
CpH methylation, including CpA methylation, is gained in neu-
rons during a period of major synaptic restructuring27,41. CpA
methylation has been shown to preferentially accumulate at lowly
transcribed genes, particularly those involved neurodevelopment
and axon guidance, later recruiting MECP2 to restrain the tran-
scription of these genes in adulthood41. This accumulation of
CpA likely enables the developing brain to progress from a stage
of widespread neuronal proliferation and migration to finely-
tuning synapse formation and pruning. However, in post-mitotic,
terminally-differentiated neurons, reactivation of cell cycle path-
ways induces apoptosis rather than proliferation42. Our data
showed an evident epigenetic and transcriptional loss of cell cycle
control in AD neurons. This includes upregulation of cyclin-
dependent kinases (CDKs), which has previously been shown to
promote neuronal death43,44. Abortive attempts of neurons to
reenter the cell cycle via CDK5 activation causes persistent
synaptic loss, neurodegeneration, and AD-like cognitive deficits
in mouse models15,45. In addition, upregulation of cell cycle genes
mediates the hyperphosphorylation and aggregation of tau, which
forms neurofibrillary tangles46,47. Therefore, loss of CpA and
other methylated cytosines at enhancers prompts the reactivation
of cell cycle and neurogenesis pathways, which leads to tauopathy
and pro-apoptotic effects in post-mitotic neurons. Enhancer

 species capable of seeding new aggregates9,10. This signifies that Aβ
peptides not only form plaques, but may jointly promote
the pathogenic loss of DNA methylation at enhancers involved in
cell
cycle
reactivation,
and
stimulate
the
propagation
of
tau pathology in the brain. Driving the overproduction of Aβ
peptides in the AD brain is BACE1. In this study, we found that AD
neurons have extensive loss of DNA methylation at enhancers
located in DSCAML1 intron 3. Chromatin conformation analysis
revealed that enhancers in DSCAML1 targeted the BACE1 gene
promoter. Hypomethylation of these enhancers occurred early in
AD, and corresponded to an aberrant upregulation of BACE1
expression early on in disease. Hence, epigenetic activation of
enhancers in DSCAML1 is an early disease event that may lead to
the overproduction of Aβ peptides, which in turn is capable of
facilitating the improper reactivation of cell cycle genes and neu-
ronal loss48–51. In support, DNA methylation changes within
DSCAML1 corresponded closely to the development of AD
symptoms.
Fig. 5 Genetic variation within DSCAML1 intron 3 enhancers affects BACE1 mRNA levels in the prefrontal cortex. ROSMAP data containing AD patients and
controls (n = 278 individuals) that had both genotype data (using genome-wide SNP arrays) and transcriptome analysis (by RNA-seq). The extended
genomic area around BACE1 (±500 kb) is shown. Haplotypes (n = 53) determined by Haploview. Analysis of haplotype association with BACE1 expression
that controlled for age, sex, postmortem interval, Braak stage, years of education, RIN, and neuronal cell proportion was performed. Pink track shows the
significance of the haplotype association with BACE1 expression (dashed red line is q < 0.05). BACE1 expression in the prefrontal cortex was influenced by
two haplotypes in DSCAML1 (q < 10−4, robust linear regression model). These two haplotypes overlapped four enhancers determined to be epigenetically
dysregulated in AD neurons, supporting their involvement in BACE1 regulation. Three haplotypes near the BACE1 TSS were also associated with BACE1
expression. Haplotype information (including SNP ID) and their population frequencies are shown for the five haplotypes significantly associated with
BACE1 expression. D’ values, measure of linkage disequilibrium, are shown in the boxes, with red boxes indicative of a strong linkage disequilibrium
between SNPs

 From our findings and the existing literature described above,
we speculate the following model: hypomethylation of enhancers
in DSCAML1 activates BACE1 to induce the formation and
progression of both Aβ plaques and neurofibrillary tangle
pathology in AD (Fig. 7). Interaction of DSCAML1 enhancers
with their target BACE1 promoter leads to overproduction of Aβ
peptides, which will eventually form plaques. Aβ peptides in turn
engages the hypomethylation of enhancers affecting neurogenesis
and cell cycle genes, which are already primed for activation due
to the normative loss of CpH methylation marks with aging.
Reactivation
of
cell
cycle
genes
facilitates
tau
hyperpho-
sphorylation, and along with Aβ plaques, leads to the formation
and spread of tangle pathology, resulting in neuronal death and
AD cognitive symptoms.
Notably, the DNA methylation changes at enhancers identified
in this study represent molecular signatures of the pathogenic
process occurring in AD neurons, though the epigenetic analysis
does not delineate causal vs secondary effects. However, we did
find 626 regions exhibiting significant DNA methylation changes
at enhancers in AD neurons prior to the arrival of pathology,
which support an early involvement of the epigenome in disease
processes. This included enhancers at DSCAML1, which had an
epigenetic status closely linked to the BACE1 transcript levels
specifically in early AD. A study limitation is that our study
sample size of 101 individuals led to a limited number of indi-
vidually
significant
methylated
cytosines,
and
hence
this
study focused on enhancer regions with significant enrichment
of top differentially methylated cytosines. However, both the
individual cytosine and region analysis supported that the
DSCAML1 intron 3 enhancers were differentially methylated in
AD neurons. Moreover, the integration of epigenetics and tran-
scriptomic data, the replication of our findings with independent
proteomics dataset of cortical neurons36, as well as further
characterization with the large, independent ROSMAP data38 that
included clinical AD symptoms outlines a useful approach
for epigenomic studies of brain diseases. In addition, our deep-
sequencing DNA methylation maps emphasize the dynamic
regulation of enhancer elements in human brain neurons
occurring with age and AD progression.
Our investigation of the molecular changes occurring in AD
neurons has the potential to advance disease-modifying treat-
ments for AD. Currently, there are ongoing clinical trials testing
the suitability of BACE1 inhibitors for the treatment of pro-
dromal AD, with the mindset that inhibiting BACE1 blocks one
of the earliest pathogenic events in AD54. However, concerns
regarding cognitive side effects and safety have been raised in
regards to abolishing the healthy physiological functions of
BACE1 and the potential spill-over onto BACE255. An alternative
AD treatment could be to inhibit excessive BACE1 activation via
the enhancers in DSCAML1, which would treat the pathological
trigger of BACE1 overexpression, and may consequently mini-
mize side effects. Compounds involving enhancer-RNA down-
regulation or zinc finger protein-based approaches to block
inappropriate enhancer activity are early in development56,57, but
have been shown to cross the mammalian blood-brain-barrier,
and similar therapies show promising effects in clinical trials for
hepatitis C and HIV58. Hence, targeting specific enhancers reg-
ulating BACE1 and cell cycle genes could be a novel therapeutic
avenue for AD, applicable to both early and late stage AD.
Methods
No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample size.
Study cohort. Prefrontal cortex tissue of our sample cohort was obtained from the
MRC London Neurodegenerative Diseases Brain Bank with approval from the
ethics committees of the Van Andel Research Institute and the Centre for
Addiction and Mental Health (IRB #15025). For each individual, we had infor-
mation on patient demographics (age, sex, and ethnicity), tissue quality (post-
mortem interval and brain pH), age of disease onset, and neurofibrillary tangle
burden (Braak stage). Our study included 101 individuals (Female: 47; Male: 54),
which were all of European ancestry. The mean age at death is 83.03 years; range
was 54–105. These individuals displayed no/mild (Braak stage 1–2, n = 38),
moderate (Braak stage 3–4, n = 32) and severe (Braak stage 5–6, n = 31) AD
pathology (Supplementary Table 1). Braak stages of disease propagation have been
described as the transentorhinal stages 1–2: unaffected/clinically silent, limbic
stages 3–4: incipient AD, and neocortical stages 5–6: fully developed AD3. In our

Fig. 7 Proposed model displaying the contribution of enhancer dysregulation to the development and progression of AD. In aging, neurons gradually lose
CpH methylation at enhancers, especially at enhancers regulating genes involved in the early cell cycle. Aging and other AD risk factors that trigger
improper attempts of neurons to renter the cell cycle promotes the formation of neurofibrillary tangles in the AD brain and is neurotoxic. In AD neurons
there is also a hypomethylation of enhancers in DSCAML1 that occurs early in disease. Enhancers in DSCAML1 activate BACE1 expression, which leads to the
increased production of the Aβ peptides. Aβ peptides promotes an accelerated loss of DNA methylation at enhancers in AD neurons, thereby facilitating
aberrant cell cycle reactivation. Aβ peptides also forms plaques, which fuels the spread of neurofibrillary tangle pathology across the brain. Consequently,
epigenetic changes at enhancers in AD neurons contributes to the pathology, neurodegeneration, and cognitive symptoms of AD

 sample cohort, clinical diagnosis of AD correlated closely with neurofibrillary
tangle burden (Pearson’s coefficient R = 0.78; p < 10−15). Neurons of the prefrontal
cortex were selected for this study, as this region typically exhibits neuronal loss
late in AD and is relevant to multiple common neuropathological phenotypes in
the aging population2.
DNA methylation fine-mapping with bisulfite padlock probes. DNA methyla-
tion was examined with single nucleotide resolution in human brain enhancers
using the bisulfite padlock probe technique59,60 in prefrontal cortex neuronal
nuclei (isolation described in Supplementary Methods). Enhancers were identified
using EpiCompare tool61, which predicts tissue/cell-type-specific enhancers/pro-
moters based on chromatin state data defined by ChromHMM tool from the
RoadMap Epigenomics Project13. We used the 18-state ChromHMM model and
included enhancers that are genic, active, weak, or poised/bivalent (7_EnhG1,
8_EnhG2, 9_EnhA1, 10_EnhA2, 11_EnhWk, 15_EnhBiv). We identified enhancers
significantly enriched in the adult brain relative to all other body tissues, as
determined by Fisher’s exact comparisons of 200 bp genome windows (ranked p-
value corrected for multiple testing by FDR). They can be downloaded from the
Tissue Specific Enhancers website (http://epigenome.wustl.edu/TSE/browse.php).
In addition to including these brain-specific enhancers, we included all enhancers
present in the adult prefrontal cortex (E073), inferior temporal lobe (E072), and
substantia nigra (E074). Since promoters can at times act as enhancers28, we
included brain promoters defined by the 18-state ChromHMM model to be active,
near a TSS site, or poised/bivalent (1_TssA, 2_TssFlnk, 3_TssFlnkU, 4_TssFlnkD,
14_TssBiv; for E073, E072, and E074).
Padlock probes were generated to target the unique (non-repetitive) genome
following bisulfite conversion using the ppDesigner software59. Probes (n = 59,009)
were designed for both the forward and reverse DNA strands using the human
GRCh37/hg19 genome. Probe sequences are described in Supplementary Data 5.
Probes were synthesized using a programmable microfluidic microarray platform
(CustomArray, Inc.) and were prepared for padlock investigations, as described60.
Fine-mapping of DNA methylation at enhancers using the bisulfite padlock
probes approach was performed using the described protocol60. In brief, genomic
DNA for each sample was bisulfite-converted and purified using the EZ DNA
Methylation-Lightning Kit (Zymo Research). The bisulfite-converted DNA (140
ng) was hybridized to the padlock probes (1.5 ng). Targeted regions were extended
using PfuTurbo Cx (Agilent Technologies) and circularization was completed using
Ampligase (Epicentre). Non-circularized DNA was digested using an exonuclease
cocktail and the remaining circularized DNA was amplified using a common linker
sequence in the padlock probe. Libraries were PCR amplified, pooled in equimolar
amounts, purified by QIAquick Gel Extraction kit (Qiagen) and quantified by
qPCR (Kapa Biosystems) on a ViiA 7 Real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems).
Next-generation sequencing of the libraries was done across three flow cells (24
lanes) on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 machine in HiOutput mode at the Epigenetics
Lab at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health in Toronto, Canada, which
yielded ~40 million reads/samples.
Epigenomic data analysis. To analyze the bisulfite padlock probes data we used a
custom pipeline based on the Bismark tool62. DNA methylation status was inter-
rogated at every cytosine site (CpG and CpH) covered by padlock probes targeting
35,288 regulatory regions across the genome of 131 samples (n = 106 unique
samples, two whole-genome amplified (WGA) control samples and 23 replicate
samples). For each sample, adapter sequences were removed from the reads using
Trimmomatic-0.32, and reads aligning to the phiX DNA spiked-in were removed.
Reads were then aligned to the target reference genome (GRCh37/hg19). Methy-
lation calls were determined as the percentage of fraction of spanning reads that
retained the reference “C”, and were not converted to “T” from the bisulfite
treatment. Methylation calls were only considered if 30 or more reads spanned the
cytosine. Bisulfite conversion efficiency was on average 99.24 ± 0.007%. Technical
and sequencing replicates confirmed a high reproducibility in sample-level
methylation correlation analysis (average R for technical replicates: 0.976; average
R for sequencing replicates: 0.998; Supplementary Fig. 2). There were seven sam-
ples (five unique samples and two replicates) that were excluded from further
analyses due to poor inter-sample correlations (>10% difference). Replicate sam-
ples (n = 21) were then merged by taking the mean across replicates at each CpG/
CpH site. All CpG/CpH sites with a methylation call in at least 70% of samples
proceeded in the analyses. CpG/CpH sites that had a methylation call of 0 across all
samples were excluded. We also removed cytosine sites overlapping common SNPs
(minor allele frequency ≥ 0.05), as identified by the 1000 Genomes Project (phase 3
v5a 20130502 release for chr1~chr22, v1b 20130502 for chrX; all populations and
European populations)63. At the end of these pre-processing steps, a subset of
101 samples with quality-controlled genome-wide methylation data at 1,207,507
CpGs/CpHs located across 29,132 regulatory regions were retained for downstream
analysis.
Our analysis identified, in neurons, genomic regions with DNA methylation
changes associated with AD pathology. We first transformed DNA methylation B-
values to M-values using the lumi (v2.30.0) package, and then ran a multivariate
robust linear regression model with empirical Bayes from limma (v3.30.13)
statistical package64 using Braak stage as the independent variable and each CpG/
CpH methylation as an dependent variable, adjusting for age, sex, postmortem
interval, and neuron subtype proportion (see neuronal subtype deconvolution
methods below). We then identified differentially methylated regions in AD
neurons, by determining the regions enriched with CpG/CpH methylation
differences in AD. First, the top 10% significant CpGs/CpHs were selected based on
the linear regression modeling results as the differentially methylated Cs (DMCs).
Regions for DMCs were generated by grouping all cytosines within ±1000 bp. A
hypergeometric test was carried out to assess the enrichment of DMCs in each
region relative to all cytosines profiled in each of the same regions (DMCs and
non-DMCs), with the background as top 10% of cytosines relative to all profiled
cytosines. Benjamini-Hochberg adjustment for multiple testing was then applied.
Differentially methylated regions (regions enriched with top 10% DMCs) met the
criteria of q < 0.05 and ≥1% cytosine methylation change between Braak stage
groups. The same approach was used in the analysis identifying differentially
methylated regions in early AD pathology (Braak stage 1–4). We also confirmed
that there was no inflation (genomic inflation factor = 0.90) or over-detection bias
(test statistic bias = −0.10) in our data using BACON65 (Bayesian correction
method), and that inflation/bias adjustment yielded analogous sites (Pearson’s
correlation R = 0.95, p < 10−15).
The major neuronal subtypes in the prefrontal cortex consist of 70–85%
excitatory glutamatergic neurons, while the remaining 15–30% are inhibitory
GABAergic neurons66. In our DNA methylation analysis in prefrontal cortex
neurons, we controlled for variation in neuronal subtype (glutamate and GABA)
between samples. Neuronal subtype proportion for each sample was quantified
using the CETS tool67 and markers obtained from DNA methylation reference
maps generated for glutamate and GABA neurons by PsychENCODE. First we
selected 1144 reference cytosine sites that were both present in our epigenomics
dataset and showed significant differences in DNA methylation between isolated
glutamate and GABA neurons in the EpiGABA methylation dataset from
PsychENCODE Knowledge Portal (Synapse ID: syn4874178 [https://www.synapse.
org/#!Synapse:syn4874178]). Reference cytosine sites met the following criteria:
paired t-test p ≤ 0.05 between neuronal subtypes; DNA methylation change ≥5%,
and not significantly different in AD. We then used CETS67 and the reference
cytosine sites to estimate neuronal subtype proportion in each sample of our
epigenomics dataset (Supplementary Fig. 3a).
In addition, we verified that there was not a selective loss of any of the
21 specific types of glutamatergic or GABAergic neurons29. For this, we used the
gene body CpH methylation markers provided in a recent single cell DNA
methylome analysis in the human frontal cortex29. In our dataset, we averaged
CpH methylation within gene bodies (±100 kb), and found 582 neuronal gene
signatures (out of 1012) reported in ref. 29 Cell-type deconvolution was performed
using CIBERSORT68 (http://cibersort.stanford.edu), which has previously been
applied to DNA methylation data for cell-type deconvolution69. Using the neuronal
signature matrix (582 gene CpH markers), CIBERSORT68 was run (100
permutations). We observed that the proportion of the specific neuronal subtypes
in our NeuN+samples was analogous to those previously reported29, and there was
no significant differences in any type of neuron between the Braak stage groups
(Supplementary Fig. 3b).
TF analysis was performed using oPOSSUM (http://opossum.cisreg.ca/
oPOSSUM3/). Sequences of the 1224 enhancer regions significantly associated
with AD pathology was the input and the sequences of all regions assessed in the
bisulfite padlock probe assay was the background. To identify a significantly over-
represented TF families at AD enhancer regions, we performed the TF Binding
Site (TFBS) Cluster Analysis in oPOSSUM.
Gene annotation and enrichment analysis. Since enhancers dynamically regulate
gene expression through three-dimensional physical interactions, we analyzed Hi-
C data generated in from the human prefrontal cortex33 (Illumina HiSeq 2000
paired-end raw sequence reads; n = 1 sample; 746 Million reads; accession:
GSM2322542 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?
acc=GSM2322542]). Our Hi-C analysis pipeline involved Trim Galore (v0.4.3) for
adapter trimming, HiCUP (v0.5.9; https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/
projects/hicup/) for mapping and performing quality control, and HOMER70 for
identifying significant interactions (default: p < 0.001 and z score > 1.0), with a 40
kb resolution. Our analysis identified 58,758 interactions in total; 951 interactions
involving regions targeted in our bisulfite padlock probe assay. Hi-C gene anno-
tation involved identifying interactions with gene promoters, defined as ±2 kb of a
gene TSS. We then generated a list of genes affected by the differentially methylated
enhancers in AD (list of distinct genes, where each gene is counted only once).
There were 1207 genes annotated for differentially methylated regions in AD, while
5893 genes were determined for the background (total possible number of genes
based on all regions captured in our padlock data). To account for proximal
interactions, we use the GREAT software (http://great.stanford.edu/public/html/)
to further identify nearby genes, which added 1224 genes proximal to the differ-
entially methylated enhancers and 4206 to the background. In total, we identified
2431 genes associated with the differentially methylated regulatory regions in AD
(10,099 genes determined as the background).
Pathway enrichment analysis for the genes affected by the AD enhancers was
done using MetaCore (https://clarivate.com/products/metacore/) and was relative to
our background genes. Proteomics data were obtained from a published proteomic
analysis of neurons microdissected from Alzheimer’s disease cortex tissue36.

 We examined whether the enhancer regions associated with AD were
overlapping or near genetic polymorphisms (SNPs) identified in a large GWAS
meta-analysis of AD (International Genomics of Alzheimer’s Project, IGAP37).
First, we extracted all 1457 SNPs (GWAS p < 10−8) from IGAP (these 1457 SNPs
are in linkage disequilibrium to the 21 tagSNPs significantly associated with AD in
the IGAP study). Then using FunciSNP71, we found all other additional SNPs in
linkage disequilibrium with the 1457 SNPs with R2 ≥ 0.8, using 1000 Genomes
phase 3 (http://www.internationalgenome.org/) as reference. Enhancer overlap/
proximity to a total of 1631 SNPs was examined. We also assessed whether the
genes targeted by the AD enhancers (as determined in Hi-C analysis) were among
the identified genes in the GWAS meta-analysis of AD37.
We asked whether there was a relationship between the entire AD GWAS and
our epigenomic study of enhancers in AD neurons by pairing cytosines to the
nearest SNPs located in the same LD block. To do this, we calculated LD blocks
(1000 Genomes EUR population) using plink (http://zzz.bwh.harvard.edu/plink/),
and then assigned each HapMap3 SNP the p value and b value of the closest CpG
or CpH, with a requirement that the cytosine and SNP shared the same LD block.
We also obtained the computed LD Scores (determined by LDSC72, calculated
based on 1000 Genomes EUR population). We then performed a simple linear
regression correlating the AD GWAS (IGAP)37 and our assigned SNP values from
the epigenomics study, adjusted for LD score.
RNA-sequencing. We used RNA-seq to profile the mRNA transcriptome in the
prefrontal cortex of individuals with no/mild (Braak stage 1–2, n = 10 individuals),
moderate (Braak stage 3–4, n = 9), and severe (Braak stage 5–6, n = 6) AD
pathology (samples also in DNA methylation study above). Frozen brain tissue was
pulverized by CryoPREP (Covaris Inc.), and 20–30 mg of pulverized frozen tissue
was lysed and homogenized in QIAzol (Qiagen) using the TissueLyser II (Qiagen).
Total RNA were immediately extracted using the RNeasy Universal Mini Kit
(Qiagen) including DNase digestion. Resulting RNA quantity was assessed by
Nanodrop 8000 (Thermo Scientific) and quality was assessed with an Agilent RNA
6000 Nano Kit on a 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Inc.). Libraries were
prepared by the Van Andel Genomics Core from 500 ng of total RNA using the
KAPA RNA HyperPrep Kit with RiboseErase (v1.16) (Kapa Biosystems). RNA was
sheared to 300–400 bp. Prior to PCR amplification, cDNA fragments were ligated
to Bioo Scientific NEXTflex Adapters (Bioo Scientific). Quality and quantity of the
finished libraries were assessed using a combination of Agilent DNA High Sensi-
tivity chip (Agilent Technologies, Inc.), QuantiFluor dsDNA System (Promega
Corp.), and Kapa Illumina Library Quantification qPCR assays (Kapa Biosystems).
Individually indexed libraries were pooled and 75 bp, single end sequencing was
performed on an Illumina NextSeq 500 sequencer using a 75 bp HO sequencing kit
(v2) (Illumina Inc.), with all libraries run across 2 flow cells. Base calling was done
by Illumina NextSeq Control Software v2.0 and output was demultiplexed and
converted to FastQ format with Illumina Bcl2fastq v1.9.0.
Trim Galore (v0.11.5) was used to trim the 75 bp single ends reads prior to
genome alignment. STAR (v2.3.5a) index was generated using Ensemble GRCh37
p13 primary assembly genome and the Gencode v19 primary assembly annotation.
Read alignment was performed using a STAR and counted using RSEM. Gene
counts matrix was imported into R (v3.4.1) and low expressed genes (counts per
million <1 in more than 30% of samples) were removed prior to trimmed mean of
M-values normalization in EdgeR (v3.16.5). The limma (v3.30.13) statistical
package64 was used to transform the count matrix to log2-counts per million and
fit a robust linear model examining AD Braak stage and adjusting for age, sex,
postmortem interval, neuronal cell composition, and RNA Integrity Number (RIN)
with empirical Bayes. The variancePartition package73 was used to quantify
variation of each factor in RNA-Seq data (Supplementary Fig. 7). Differential
expression p-values were adjusted for multiple testing correction using the
Benjamini-Hochberg method in the stats package (v3.3.3). Statistical significance
for differentially expressed genes was q < 0.05.
Our RNA-seq analysis is corrected for the proportion of neuronal cells in each
sample. Cell-type deconvolution was performed using CIBERSORT68 (http://
cibersort.stanford.edu), which performs a linear support vector machine learning
algorithm on normalized cell-type-specific count data. In this approach, we used a
gene signature matrix (involving 903 cell-specific marker genes) derived from
single cell RNA-seq measures in adult human brain cells (signature matrix;74
source75). CIBERSORT68 was run (100 permutations), and values were used for the
neuronal cell composition adjustment in the robust linear model for differential
expression analysis.
In addition, RIN was measured and verified by transcript integrity number
TIN76 using human representative RefSeq transcripts to determine the 5′ to 3′
integrity of mRNA within each sample. This approach determines both RNA
quality based on the integrity of mRNA and accounts for transcript specific decay
(rather than an indirect measure of total/ribosomal RNA)76.
Network analysis. Using the OmicsIntegrator77, we merged epigenetic and tran-
scriptomic sequencing data to identify underlying molecular pathways in AD. The
OmicsIntegrator77 package consists of two software tools: Garnet and Forest77. The
Garnet algorithm identified TFs associated with mRNA expression changes by
incorporating epigenetic data (epigenetically altered sequences scanned for TF
binding sites), and then TF affinity scores were regressed against gene expression
changes77. We used the 1224 significantly epigenetically altered enhancer regions
in AD and their related sequences, as well as the significantly differentially
expressed genes in AD in our RNA-seq experiment and log fold change, as input
for Garnet. Garnet confirmed that a top differentially expressed motif was the ETS
family (p < 0.05), as described earlier. Next, the Forest tool was used to find
functional subnetworks connecting omic hits. Here, a confidence-weighted inter-
actome (iRefIndex protein-protein interaction network, version 13.0) is integrated
with our data using the Steiner forest algorithm77. To identify AD subnetworks
(Fig. 3), we used our Garnet output along with differentially expressed genes in AD
with the prize score (as calculated as −log2(q value)), as input for Forest. We
repeated this step adding the independently generated AD proteomics data36
(Supplementary Fig. 8). Forest output was visualized with Cytoscape (v3.6.0).
Aging analysis. Our analyses of DNA methylation changes with age were per-
formed on CpG (n = 531) and CpH (n = 3,661) sites located in top differentially
methylated enhancers in AD (n = 848 enhancers with both epigenetic and asso-
ciated gene transcript differences in AD, as identified in omics integration analysis).
The % methylation was calculated from number of methylated sites/total number
of sites as described previously27. A linear regression (limma) was performed to
determine the % CpH methylation change occurring with age, after controlling for
sex, postmortem interval, Braak stage, and neuron subtype proportion. Within
each Braak stage group the % methylation change with age was determined by
linear regression (limma), adjusted for sex, postmortem interval, and neuronal
proportion. We also examined aging changes in infancy and early adulthood in all
differentially methylated enhancers in AD using a whole-genome bisulfite
sequencing dataset of isolated neurons27.
The DNA methylation age calculator17 was used to determine whether the
epigenetic age of AD neurons exceeded their chronological age. CpH methylation
in enhancers for Braak stage 1–2 (n = 38 individuals) was used as the training
dataset to estimate the DNA methylation age in the test datasets: Braak stage 3–4
(n = 32) and Braak stage 5–6 (n = 31). Using the training dataset, we regressed a
calibrated version of chronological age on 3661 CpH methylation using an elastic
net regression model17. As done previously17,78,79, the elastic net mixing
parameter, alpha, was set to 0.5, and the lambda parameter was determined
through a tenfold cross validation of the training data. Next, using the resulting
model and 3661 CpH methylation sites, the DNA methylation age was predicted
for each test subject. A paired t-test was performed to determine if there was a
significant change between the chronological age and DNA methylation age in the
test datasets.
