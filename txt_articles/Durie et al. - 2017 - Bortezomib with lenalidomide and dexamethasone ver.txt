Summary
Background—Lenalidomide plus dexamethasone is a reference treatment for patients with 
newly diagnosed myeloma. The combination of the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib with 
lenalidomide and dexamethasone has shown significant efficacy in the setting of newly diagnosed 
myeloma. We aimed to study whether the addition of bortezomib to lenalidomide and 
dexamethasone would improve progression-free survival and provide better response rates in 
patients with previously untreated multiple myeloma who were not planned for immediate 
autologous stem-cell transplant.
Methods—In this randomised, open-label, phase 3 trial, we recruited patients with newly 
diagnosed multiple myeloma aged 18 years and older from participating Southwest Oncology 
Group (SWOG) and National Clinical Trial Network (NCTN) institutions (both inpatient and 
outpatient settings). Key inclusion criteria were presence of CRAB (C=calcium elevation; R=renal 
impairment; A=anaemia; B=bone involvement) criteria with measurable disease (measured by 
assessment of free light chains), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance 
status of 0–3, haemoglobin concentration 9 g/dL or higher, absolute neutrophil count 1 × 103 cells 
per mm3; or higher, and a platelet count of 80 000/mm3 or higher. We randomly assigned (1:1) 
patients to receive either an initial treatment of bortezomib with lenalidomide and dexamethasone 
(VRd group) or lenalidomide and dexamethasone alone (Rd group). Randomisation was stratified 
based on International Staging System stage (I, II, or III) and intent to transplant (yes vs no). The 
VRd regimen was given as eight 21-day cycles. Bortezomib was given at 1·3 mg/m2 intravenously 
on days 1, 4, 8, and 11, combined with oral lenalidomide 25 mg daily on days 1–14 plus oral 
dexamethasone 20 mg daily on days 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11, and 12. The Rd regimen was given as six 
28-day cycles. The standard Rd regimen consisted of 25 mg oral lenalidomide once a day for days 
1–21 plus 40 mg oral dexamethasone once a day on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. The primary endpoint 
was progression-free survival using a prespecified one-sided stratified log rank test at a 
significance level of 0·02. Analyses were intention to treat. This trial is registered with 
ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00644228.

 Findings—Between April, 2008, and February, 2012, we randomly assigned 525 patients at 139 
participating institutions (264 to VRd and 261 to Rd). In the randomly assigned patients, 21 
patients in the VRd group and 31 in the Rd group were deemed ineligible based mainly on 
missing, insufficient, or early or late baseline laboratory data. Median progression-free survival 
was significantly improved in the VRd group (43 months vs 30 months in the Rd group; stratified 
hazard ratio [HR] 0·712, 96% CI 0·56–0·906; one-sided p value 0·0018). The median overall 
survival was also significantly improved in the VRd group (75 months vs 64 months in the Rd 
group, HR 0·709, 95% CI 0·524–0·959; two-sided p value 0·025). The rates of overall response 
(partial response or better) were 82% (176/216) in the VRd group and 72% (153/214) in the Rd 
group, and 16% (34/216) and 8% (18/214) of patients who were assessable for response in these 
respective groups had a complete response or better. Adverse events of grade 3 or higher were 
reported in 198 (82%) of 241 patients in the VRd group and 169 (75%) of 226 patients in the Rd 
group; 55 (23%) and 22 (10%) patients discontinued induction treatment because of adverse 
events, respectively. There were no treatment-related deaths in the Rd group, and two in the VRd 
group.
Interpretation—In patients with newly diagnosed myeloma, the addition of bortezomib to 
lenalidomide and dexamethasone resulted in significantly improved progression-free and overall 
survival and had an acceptable risk-benefit profile.
Funding—NIH, NCI, NCTN, Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Takeda Oncology Company, and 
Celgene Corporation.
Introduction
Front-line or initial therapy for multiple myeloma is designed to achieve the maximum 
response in the largest number of patients with associated sustained remission duration and 
prolonged survival.1,2 The use of the immunomodulatory drugs thalidomide and 
lenalidomide, and the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib, have been associated with improved 
survival.3,4 Combinations of lenalidomide or bortezomib with conventional anti-multiple 
myeloma drugs have produced high overall response rates and excellent outcomes in both 
the relapsed and front-line setting as reviewed recently.5-7 Both lenalidomide and 
bortezomib are approved for use in patients with previously untreated multiple myeloma.
Lenalidomide and bortezomib have different but synergistic mechanisms of action. Shared 
pathways involve caspase-mediated apoptosis and inhibition of NF-kappa B signalling.8–10 
Both agents enhance the activity of dexamethasone. Findings of several studies have shown 
the enhanced efficacy of two and three drug combinations including lenalidomide, 
bortezomib, and dexamethasone.11–13 These studies have also shown a favourable toxicity 
profile of immunomodulatory drugs and proteasome inhibitor combinations with 
dexamethasone. A phase 1/2 study14 of lenalidomide, bortezomib, and dexamethasone 
reported both high efficacy and favourable tolerability in the treatment of newly diagnosed 
multiple myeloma.
We hypothesised that the addition of bortezomib to lenalidomide and dexamethasone would 
provide better response rates and improve progression-free survival. This report is the first 
prospective randomised phase 3 trial of the three drug combination bortezomib,

 lenalidomide, and dexamethasone versus the two drug combination lenalidomide and 
dexamethasone in newly diagnosed myeloma without intent for immediate autologous stem-
cell transplantation (ASCT).
Methods
Patients and study design
The SWOG S0777 randomised, open-label phase 3 trial was done at Southwest Oncology 
Group (SWOG) and National Clinical Trials (NCTN) member institutions as listed in the 
appendix. Patients aged 18 years or older with newly diagnosed myeloma were eligible. Key 
inclusion criteria were: presence of CRAB criteria (C=calcium elevation; R=renal 
impairment; A=anaemia; B=bone involvement) with measurable disease (measured by 
assessment of free light chains).15 No patients with earlier disease were included in this trial. 
The Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0–3 was 
acceptable.16 Allowable blood count values were: haemoglobin ≥9 g/dL; absolute neutrophil 
count ≥1× 103 cells per mm3; platelet count ≥80 000/mm3. Major exclusion criteria were: 
creatinine clearance ≤30 mL/min; cardiac status New York Heart Association class III/IV or 
recent myocardial infarction; active hepatitis B or C or HIV or uncontrolled other infection; 
previous cancer prior to study registration or enrolment; or poorly controlled diabetes.
The study protocol was approved by the institutional review boards of all participating 
institutions. All patients provided written informed consent.
Randomisation
Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive initial treatment of bortezomib with 
lenalidomide and dexamethasone (VRd) or lenalidomide and dexamethasone (Rd). We used 
a dynamic allocation algorithm developed by Pocock and Simon to balance treatment 
assignment by the stratification factors. The randomisation was stratified based on 
International Staging System stage (I, II, or III) and intent to transplant (yes vs no).17 
Patients at participating NCTN institutions were randomly assigned upon registration. 
Randomisation procedures were developed and maintained by the SWOG statistics and data 
management centre. There was no masking to treatment interventions.
Procedures
The VRd regimen was given as eight 21-day cycles. Bortezomib was given at 1·3 mg/m2 
intravenously on days 1, 4, 8, and 11 combined with 25 mg oral lenalidomide once a day on 
days 1–14 plus 20 mg oral dexamethasone on days 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11, and 12. The Rd 
regimen was given as six 28-day cycles. The standard Rd regimen was used consisting of 25 
mg oral lenalidomide once a day for days 1–21 plus 40 mg oral dexamethasone on days 1, 8, 
15, and 22. The total amount of lenalidomide administered for induction was balanced for 
each group (VRd: 2800 mg lenalidomide total dose; Rd: 3150 mg total dose). Patients in the 
VRd group received herpes simplex virus prophylaxis. All patients received 325 mg oral 
aspirin once a day to reduce the risk of thromboembolic complications.

 Upon completion of induction, all patients received ongoing maintenance with 25 mg oral 
lenalidomide once a day for 21 days plus 40 mg oral dexamethasone once a day for days 1, 
8, 15, and 22 of each 28-day cycle. Stem-cell collection was allowed for those patients 
considering future transplant. With dosage adjustments as necessary using slide adjustment 
scale within the protocol, maintenance was continued until emergence of progressive 
disease, toxic effects, or patient withdrawal.
Outcomes
The primary endpoint was progression-free survival from the time of randomisation. 
Secondary endpoints were overall survival, the rate of overall response (partial response or 
better), safety, and to bank specimens for future translational medicine research. Data were 
collected and analysed by the SWOG statistical centre team in standard SWOG cooperative 
group procedural fashion.
Treatment response and disease progression were assessed centrally and followed the 
international uniform response criteria for multiple myeloma.18 Disease assessments were 
done at the end of each cycle. After treatment discontinuation because of toxic effects, 
disease progression, or patient withdrawal, patients were followed up for disease status every 
6 months, until death or for a maximum of 6 years after initial randomisation.
We did fluorescence in-situ hybridisation (FISH) analysis of bone marrow cells at trial entry. 
Preliminary analyses from available data from 316 patients suggested that 33% were deemed 
high risk by one or more of the high risk features including t(4;14), t(14;16), or chromosome 
17 deletion abnormalities. Individual site FISH testing and reports will be further reviewed 
as part of data assessment in the present study to confirm details including cell numbers and 
percentages as well as possible coexistence of high, intermediate, and good risk features. We 
used standard percentage cutoff values for each type of FISH test abnormality (typically 5%, 
but ranging from 1·5% to 7·5%).
We collected data for adverse events every 3 months while on treatment and again at the end 
of induction and maintenance treatment. All adverse events were initially graded according 
to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), 
version 3.0. From April 6, 2011, serious adverse events were graded according to CTCAE 
version 4.0. An independent data and safety monitoring committee reviewed unblinded 
safety data twice a year.
Statistical analysis
The sample size was based on the assumption of an eligible patient accrual rate of 110 
patients per year (440 eligible patients over 4 years), a median progression-free survival of 
about 3 years in the control group, exponential distribution of progression-free survival, and 
roughly 2·5 years of additional follow up. The study was designed to detect a hazard ratio of 
1·5, with approximately 87% power and an overall study alpha of 0·05. Thus, to allow for an 
interim analysis, a one-sided 0·02 significance level was used to assess the primary 
progression-free survival endpoint. The primary endpoint was evaluated with the use of a 
group-sequential design, with two planned interim analyses at 1/3 and 2/3 of the total 
number of events. A Haybittle–Peto approach was used for alpha spending and a one-sided

 alpha of 0·0025 was used for each interim analysis.19,20 At the final analysis, a one-sided 
stratified log-rank test was done at the 0·02 significance level for an overall one-sided alpha 
of 0·025.21
We compared progression-free survival and overall survival between treatment groups using 
a log-rank test stratified according to the factors used for randomisation.19,22 Hazard ratios 
were estimated by means of a stratified Cox proportional-hazards model.23 The multivariate 
analysis were done with a model that was not stratified by, rather adjusted for stratification 
factors, to provide some idea as to how the stratification factors were associated with 
outcome. We used the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to assess assumptions of proportional 
hazards. There was no evidence of violation of proportional hazards for any of the 
covariates. Survival curves were based on the Kaplan-Meier method.22 We compared the 
overall response rate between groups using a stratified Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test.24,25 
The odds ratio and corresponding 95% confidence interval were estimated with the use of 
the Mantel-Haenszel method.24,25 Duration of response was summarised by means of the 
Kaplan-Meier method.22 All primary and secondary endpoint analyses were predefined 
within the protocol.
Analyses were done on an intention to treat basis that incorporated all eligible patients. 
Patients with missing parameters of interest were excluded from multivariate analyses. We 
used SAS (version 4) for all analyses. Baseline variables were compared using Fisher’s 
exact test. The safety analysis included all eligible patients who received at least one dose of 
study treatment and who were evaluated for toxic effects.
Role of the funding source
The funder agreed to provide support for the study as designed. The funder had no role in 
data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of the report. The corresponding 
author had full access to all the data in the study and had final responsibility for the decision 
to submit for publication.
Results
Between April, 2008, and February, 2012, 525 patients at 139 participating SWOG and 
NCTN institutions were randomly assigned: 264 to VRd and 261 to Rd. There were no 
significant changes made to the trial design following initial activation. Baseline 
characteristics were well balanced between treatment groups, with the exception of sex and 
age (ie, there were more women and patients were older in the Rd group; table 1).
In the randomly assigned patients, 21 patients in the VRd group and 31 in the Rd group were 
deemed ineligible based mainly on missing, insufficient, or early or late baseline laboratory 
(figure 1). Two patients, one in each group, were not analysable for efficacy because of 
consent issues; one patient withdrew consent and one patient who was under guardianship 
provided consent without guardian approval and so the consent provided was deemed 
invalid. For VRd, 242 patients were thus eligible and analysable for efficacy, with 241 
evaluable for toxic effects and 216 assessable for response. For the Rd group, 229 patients 
were eligible and analysable for efficacy, with 226 evaluable for toxicity and 214 assessable

 for response. At the time of prespecified primary efficacy analyses, 66 patients (14% of 
eligible patients) were still on maintenance therapy. The median overall follow up was 55 
months (IQR 48–68), 54 months (IQR 47–66) for VRd and 56 months (50–70) for the Rd 
group. The median duration of maintenance was 385 days.
At the time of analysis, the study met its primary objective of showing that the addition of 
bortezomib significantly improved progression-free survival. Specifically, the one-sided 
stratified log-rank p value fell well below the prespecified significance level of 0·02.The 
stratified hazard ratio and one-sided stratified log-rank p value in favour of VRd versus Rd 
were 0·712 (96% Wald confidence interval 0·560–0·906; p=0·0018, two-sided p value 
0·0037) with an unstratified median progression-free survival of 43 months (95% CI 39–52) 
for VRd versus 30 months (25–39) for the Rd group (figure 2A). We also assessed response 
duration with a stratified log-rank test, which suggested improved response duration in 
patients receiving VRd (HR 0·695, two-sided p value 0·0133). The median response duration 
was 52 months in the VRd group versus 38 months for the Rd group (figure 2B).
With regard to dose intensity, in the Rd group unplanned dose modifications occurred in 27 
(12%) of 223 and 17 (14%) of 121 patients with available dosing data during induction and 
maintenance, respectively; in the VRd group, unplanned dose modifications occurred in 38 
(16%) of 239 and 24 (24%) of 102 patients with available dosing data, respectively. At the 
time of this report, at least 46 (10%) of 471 patients are estimated to have proceeded to 
stem-cell harvest and planned transplant after leaving the study. Intent to transplant was a 
stratification factor and balanced between treatment groups (table 1).
A prespecified secondary endpoint analysis was the assessment of overall survival. The 
stratified hazard ratio and one-sided stratified log-rank p value in favour of VRd versus Rd 
were HR 0·709 (95% Wald CI 0·524–0·959; p=0·0125; two-sided p=0·0250) with median 
overall survival of 75 months for VRd versus 64 months for the Rd group (figure 2C). The 
median overall survival values were unchanged when patients leaving the study with intent 
for stem-cell harvest or transplant were censored (medians 75 months and 64 months: 
p=0·0366).
The median progression-free survival was 16 months for Rd and 38 months with VRd in the 
44 patients who were high risk by FISH, and 15 and 34 months in the 17 patients with 
t(4;14) by FISH, respectively. These differences were not significant (stratified log-rank 
p=0·19 and 0·96, respectively). In response to the difference in the distribution of patients 65 
years and older between treatment groups, and in view of the previously described 
significance of age as a prognostic factor for both progression-free survival and overall 
survival, univariately, we did age-adjusted progression-free survival and overall survival 
multivariate models (table 2). After accounting for the effects of age (≥65 years), the effect 
of treatment group remained significant for both progression-free survival and overall 
survival (table 2).
The median age did not differ between treatment groups (63 years [IQR 56–70] for VRd and 
63 years [IQR 56–71] for the Rd group). Both progression-free survival and overall survival 
were improved in each of the three age categories: younger than 65 years; 65–75 years; and

 older than 75 years (patients older than 75 years had median progression-free survival of 39 
months vs 20 months and median overall survival of 63 months vs 31 months). However, 
these differences were only significant for progression-free survival in patients younger than 
65 years and for overall survival in patients older than 75 years. Although the distribution of 
sex differed between groups, it was not univariately associated with survival outcomes and 
was thus not included in multivariate modelling.
Table 3 provides confirmed responses. We did sensitivity analyses in which we assessed 
patients who were assessable for response at the time of analysis and noted improved 
response in patients in the VRd group over those in the Rd group (81·5% vs 71·5%; p=0·02). 
Among these assessable patients, 15·7% in the VRd group and 8·4% in the Rd group had a 
complete response or better (table 3). The overall response rate (confirmed partial response 
or better, which includes unconfirmed and confirmed very good partial response, complete 
response, and stringent complete response), with non-assessable patients included as non-
responders, was 72·7% and 66·8% in the VRd and Rd groups, respectively (p=0·20).
Outcomes by response category at 6 and 12 months were assessed using landmarked 
analyses (figure 3). The median progression-free survival for patients with very good partial 
response or better at 6 months was 49 months versus 34 months for patients with partial 
response and 18 months for those with stable disease (figure 3A). The median overall 
survival for patients with partial response at 12 months was 59 months versus 55 months for 
those with progressive disease and 48 months for patients with stable disease; overall 
survival was not reached in those with very good partial response or better at 12 months 
(figure 3B).
The adverse events defined by Common Toxicity Criteria category and specific toxic effects 
were fairly well balanced between the two groups (table 4). The commonest haematological 
adverse events (≥ grade 3 and at least possibly attributable to treatment) were anaemia, 
lymphopenia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia (table 4). The commonest non-
haematological adverse events (≥ grade 3 and at least possibly attributable to treatment) 
were: fatigue, sensory neuropathy, hyperglycaemia, thrombosis or embolism, hypokalaemia, 
muscle weakness, diarrhoea, and dehydration. As expected, grade 3 or worse neurological 
toxic effects were more frequent in the VRd group than in the Rd group (33% vs 11%; 
p<0·0001). 20 patients had a second primary cancer (ten [4%] in the VRd group and ten 
[4%] in the Rd group; appendix).
Discussion
The addition of bortezomib to lenalidomide and dexamethasone led to significantly 
improved outcomes for patients with previously untreated multiple myeloma. The 
progression-free survival was improved by 13 months and overall survival by 11 months. 
This is the first prospective randomised trial to show the value of the three drug regimen 
VRd versus the two drug regimen Rd in the absence of front-line transplantation. The value 
of the three drug regimen is further affirmed by the improved progression-free survival and 
overall survival achieved with deeper responses (ie, very good partial response or better).

 There is precedent for the added benefit of a three drug, proteasome inhibitor, 
immunomodulatory drugs, steroid combination as a first therapy, using bortezomib plus 
thalidomide plus dexamethasone for induction.26 A 2015 randomised study27 showed 
superior response rates in patients given bortezomib plus thalidomide plus dexamethasone 
versus those given bortezomib plus cyclophosphamide plus dexamethasone, emphasising the 
particular value of the three drug proteasome inhibitor plus immunomodulatory drugs plus 
steroid combination, which was first clearly shown in the original phase 1/2 trial of 
bortezomib plus lenalidomide plus dexamethasone in the previously untreated myeloma 
setting.14 This synergistic effect with proteasome inhibitor plus immunomodulatory drug 
plus dexamethasone combination is further shown by results with carfilzomib plus 
lenalidomide plus dexamethasone combinations in both front-line (high-risk smouldering 
myeloma and previously untreated myeloma) and relapsed settings.28,29 However, although 
response rates and progression-free survival were improved with the use of triplet regimens 
such as bortezomib plus thalidomide plus dexamethasone, no data exist to suggest that 
overall survival could be improved in trials comparing two modern regimens. Of note, 
findings of the FIRST trial30 showed the significantly improved outcomes of the two drug 
regimen Rd (with ongoing maintenance) over the older three drug melphalan-based regimen 
of melphalan plus prednisone plus thalidomide. Our findings show that overall survival can 
be further improved by the addition of a proteasome inhibitor to Rd.
The median progression-free survival with Rd noted in our trial (30 months) is longer than 
the median progression-free survival for the continuous Rd group in the FIRST trial (25·5 
months), probably because of differences in age-distribution between the two trials.30 The 
progression-free survival and overall survival results in the SWOG S0777 trial compare well 
with the early findings in the IFM portion of the Intergroupe Francophone du Myélome/
Dana Farber Cancer Institute (IFM/DFCI) front-line trial using VRd with or without upfront 
autologous stem-cell transplantation reported at the American Society of Hematology 
conference in 2015.31
Our trial was conceived in 2007 and accrued patients between 2008 and 2012. It 
encompassed a time in which bortezomib was given if possible at maximum doses twice a 
week intravenously. This resulted in almost a quarter of patients assessable for toxic effects 
stopping VRd induction treatment prematurely and 10% of those in the Rd group. 
Associated with this was the significantly increased grade 3 or worse neuropathic and 
gastrointestinal adverse events with the VRd regimen versus the Rd regimen. If bortezomib 
had been given subcutaneously as it is now, some more serious neuropathic side-effects 
could have been avoided and additional benefit might have been realised.32
In our study, the number of secondary primary cancers was low at just ten cases in each 
group.33 The distribution between skin, solid, and bone marrow-derived cancers was as 
anticipated in view of the median follow up of roughly 4·6 years. The 4% cumulative overall 
incidence of secondary primary cancers in the SWOG S0777 trial is less than the 6·9% 
cumulative incidence reported in the recent meta-analysis for lenalidomide-containing 
groups of treatment at 5 years (3·9% at 3 years).33 The higher 6·9% cumulative incidence is 
linked to combined use of oral melphalan in the meta-analysis series, which was not a factor 
in SWOG S0777.

 It should be noted that although confirmed responses were superior for the VRd group, the 
overall responses are lower than in the original front-line VRd study reported by Richardson 
and colleagues.14 One reason is likely to be failure to confirm a particular level of response 
with a second reading (ie, second response assessment). For example, 20 patients (9%) of 
216 in the VRd group had unconfirmed partial response and were appropriately listed in the 
confirmed stable disease category. Inclusion of these 20 patients in the overall response rate 
category would have given an overall response rate of more than 90%. Nevertheless, our 
findings show that the VRd regimen is very active in newly diagnosed myeloma. Only 2·8% 
of patients had initial progressive disease or death as a primary assessment.
The SWOG S0777 trial had several limitations. The response assessment was suboptimal as 
already noted. Because the two published regimens of VRd and Rd were being compared, 
there were eight 3-week cycles of VRd compared with six 4-week cycles of Rd, rather than 
perfectly matched 3-week or 4-week cycles. Nonetheless, the administered dose of 
lenalidomide was well-balanced between groups. Bortezomib was given intravenously twice 
per week as was standard practice at the time the trial began. This method compromised the 
outcomes by 2016 standards because resultant neuropathy led to earlier discontinuation of 
VRd induction therapy. If age had been a stratification factor, it would have simplified the 
assessment of age with respect to outcomes. The exclusion of patients with impaired renal 
function or compromised bone marrow function meant that no comments can be made about 
these groups of patients. Finally, no progression-free survival assessment for the second 
response and second remission duration was done as part of the study.
In conclusion, the results of the SWOG S0777 trial show that the triplet regimen VRd 
improved response rates, depth of response, progression-free survival, and overall survival 
compared with the currently approved front-line regimen Rd. The median overall survival in 
our study of 75 months with VRd strongly supports the general notion that triplet therapy for 
induction adds value. Additionally, with the use of weekly subcutaneous bortezomib, fewer 
toxic effects, and added survival benefit might be anticipated. Therefore, the S0777 study 
results can inform decision making for front-line therapy using a proteasome inhibitor plus 
immunomodulatory drugs plus steroid triplet treatment.

 Research in context
Evidence before this study
On Oct 15, 2007, we searched PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Central 
Register of Controlled Trials, and references from relevant articles with the search terms 
“multiple myeloma”, “treatment”, “proteasome inhibitor”, “immune modulatory agent”, 
and “phase III”. We also reviewed all recent reviews on myeloma treatment from the 
International Myeloma Working Group, and authors were asked to identify any 
appropriate citation of importance not detected by search strategies. Emphasis was placed 
on randomised clinical trials, systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and prospective and 
observational studies through December, 2015. We included only studies of adults, 
written in English and published between January, 1985, and December, 2015. We 
identified 3479 studies, and the findings showed that proteasome inhibitors and immune 
modulatory agents had important activity in the treatment of myeloma but had not been 
studied in the way proposed in Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG) S0777.
Added value of this study
To our knowledge, the S0777 study is the first to show that an all novel triple drug 
combination (bortezomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone) used in the absence of 
autologous stem-cell transplant is superior to a double drug novel combination 
(lenalidomide and dexamethasone) in terms of progression-free survival and overall 
survival in patients with newly diagnosed myeloma.
Implications of all the available evidence
Data suggest that for patients with newly diagnosed myeloma, the use of triple therapy 
incorporating an immunomodulatory agent and a proteasome inhibitor improves 
outcomes, with an acceptable risk-benefi t profi le. The S0777 study results can 
substantially inform decision making for front-line therapy using the triplet treatment 
approach in these patients.
