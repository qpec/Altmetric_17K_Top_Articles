Summary
Background Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia is a common cause of severe community-acquired and hospital-
acquired infection worldwide. We tested the hypothesis that adjunctive rifampicin would reduce bacteriologically 
confirmed treatment failure or disease recurrence, or death, by enhancing early S aureus killing, sterilising infected 
foci and blood faster, and reducing risks of dissemination and metastatic infection.
Methods In this multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, adults (≥18 years) with S aureus 
bacteraemia who had received ≤96 h of active antibiotic therapy were recruited from 29 UK hospitals. Patients were 
randomly assigned (1:1) via a computer-generated sequential randomisation list to receive 2 weeks of adjunctive 
rifampicin (600 mg or 900 mg per day according to weight, oral or intravenous) versus identical placebo, together 
with standard antibiotic therapy. Randomisation was stratified by centre. Patients, investigators, and those caring for 
the patients were masked to group allocation. The primary outcome was time to bacteriologically confirmed treatment 
failure or disease recurrence, or death (all-cause), from randomisation to 12 weeks, adjudicated by an independent 
review committee masked to the treatment. Analysis was intention to treat. This trial was registered, number 
ISRCTN37666216, and is closed to new participants.
Findings Between Dec 10, 2012, and Oct 25, 2016, 758 eligible participants were randomly assigned: 370 to rifampicin and 
388 to placebo. 485 (64%) participants had community-acquired S aureus infections, and 132 (17%) had nosocomial 
S aureus infections. 47 (6%) had meticillin-resistant infections. 301 (40%) participants had an initial deep infection focus. 
Standard antibiotics were given for 29 (IQR 18–45) days; 619 (82%) participants received flucloxacillin. By week 12, 
62 (17%) of participants who received rifampicin versus 71 (18%) who received placebo experienced treatment failure or 
disease recurrence, or died (absolute risk difference –1·4%, 95% CI –7·0 to 4·3; hazard ratio 0·96, 0·68–1·35, p=0·81). 
From randomisation to 12 weeks, no evidence of differences in serious (p=0·17) or grade 3–4 (p=0·36) adverse events 
were observed; however, 63 (17%) participants in the rifampicin group versus 39 (10%) in the placebo group had antibiotic 
or trial drug-modifying adverse events (p=0·004), and 24 (6%) versus six (2%) had drug interactions (p=0·0005).
Interpretation Adjunctive rifampicin provided no overall benefit over standard antibiotic therapy in adults with 
S aureus bacteraemia.

Introduction
Staphylococcus aureus bloodstream infection, also known 
as bacteraemia, is one of the most common and serious 
community-acquired and hospital-acquired bacterial 
infections worldwide.1 When S aureus enters the 
bloodstream it can disseminate to cause metastatic, 
deep-seated infection of almost any organ, with an 
associated mortality of approximately 20%.2 Despite the 
frequency and severity of S aureus bacteraemia, the 
optimal antibiotic treatment is uncertain. Fewer than 
1600 participants have been enrolled in randomised 
trials of antibiotic therapy for the treatment of this 
infection over the past 50 years.3 Most treatment 
recommendations are therefore based on observational 
studies and clinical experience. Opinions on best 
management vary widely,4 but current guidelines5 
recommend S aureus bacteraemia be treated with at least 
14 days of an intravenous β-lactam antibiotic, or a 
glycopeptide if the bacteria are resistant to meticillin. 
Combination antibiotic therapy is generally not recom-
mended, except in severe meticillin-resis 
tant S aureus 
(MRSA) infections (eg, endocarditis and prosthetic joint 
infections); however, evidence in support of its use in 
such cases is weak.

Adjunctive rifampicin has long been hypothesised to 
improve outcomes for serious S aureus infections.6 It has 
good oral bioavailability and penetrates cells, tissues, and 
biofilms better than β lactams and glycopeptides; there-
fore, in combination with these agents, rifampicin might 
eradicate serious S aureus infections more effectively than 
either drug alone.7 The use of adjunctive rifampicin in 
the treatment of S aureus bacteraemia varies widely 
worldwide, although case-series from the UK8 and 
Germany9 reported nearly a third (86 of 274 and 301 of 
964) of all adults with S aureus bacteraemia received 
rifampicin, particularly patients with deep-seated in-
fections. However, evidence to support benefit of treat-
ment is weak, with rifampicin associated with hepatic 
toxicity and substantial interactions with other drugs.8–10 
A systematic review11 identified four studies (three 
randomised trials and one cohort study) that included 
54 participants with S aureus bacteraemia treated with 
adjunctive rifampicin and 44 standard-therapy controls, 
and showed rifampicin to be associated with reduced all-
cause mortality and clinical or bacteriological failure; 
although data were too few to make definitive treatment 
recommendations.
Given the substantial mortality associated with 
S aureus bacteraemia, the widespread use of adjunctive 
rifampicin in its treatment, and uncertainty whether 
rifampicin’s benefits outweigh its risks, a large prag-
matic trial was needed. In ARREST, we tested the 
hypothesis that adjunctive rifampicin reduces bacterio-
logically confirmed treatment failure or disease re-
currence, or death by enhancing early killing of S aureus, 
sterilising infected foci and blood faster, thereby 
reducing the risk of dissemination and metastatic 
infection.12
Methods
Study design and participants
We did a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-
controlled trial of adjunctive rifampicin in adults with 
S aureus bacteraemia treated in 29 UK hospitals. The trial 
was approved by the London (Westminster) Research 
Ethics 
Committee 
(12/LO/0637). 
Adult 
inpatients 
(≥18 years) were eligible if they had: symptoms and signs 
of S aureus infection; meticillin-susceptible S aureus 
(MSSA), or MRSA, grown from at least one blood culture; 
received ≤96 h of active antibiotic therapy for the current 
infection (allowing any stat [one-off] doses >96 h earlier); 
no pre-existing evidence of S aureus rifampicin non-
susceptibility; and no contra 
indications to rifampicin. 
Participants were ineligible if S aureus was considered a 
blood culture contaminant or mixed with another 
organism likely to be contributing to the current infection, 
active tuberculosis was suspected, rifampicin was 
considered mandatory for any reason, or the subject had 
previously been randomised in ARREST. Participants, or 
their legal representatives (in the case of incapacity), gave

Research in context
Evidence before this study
Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia is probably the most common 
life-threatening, community-acquired and hospital-acquired 
infection worldwide, yet fewer than 1600 participants have been 
enrolled in randomised trials of antibiotic therapy for this 
infection over the past 50 years. For many years, the addition of 
rifampicin to an anti-staphylococcal penicillin or glycopeptide 
antibiotic has been hypothesised to improve outcomes from 
S aureus bacteraemia. A systematic review of relevant studies 
published before February, 2013, found three randomised trials 
and one cohort study, reporting a total of 98 participants with 
S aureus bacteraemia (54 rifampicin; 44 controls). A pooled 
analysis of data from these reports suggested rifampicin had no 
significant effect on all-cause mortality, but there was a trend for 
rifampicin to reduce clinical or bacteriologically proven treatment 
failure  (odds ratio 0·38, 95% CI 0·13–1·11, p=0·08). No relevant 
randomised trials have been published since this systematic 
review. A 2017 post-hoc analysis of a prospective observational 
cohort of 964 patients with S aureus bacteraemia examined the 
effect of combination antibiotic therapy on patient outcome. 
Combination therapy was used in 53% of patients, with 
rifampicin used in 59% of combinations. Combination therapy 
was not associated with significant reductions in mortality 
overall, but 30-day and 60-day mortality and clinical 
complications were lower in a subgroup of patients with infected 
implanted foreign devices treated with combination therapy 
compared with patients without device-related infection. 
We searched PubMed up to July 1, 2017, for clinical trials with the 
terms “rifampicin” or “rifampin”, “Staphylococcus aureus”, 
“bacteraemia”, and “bloodstream infection”.
Added value of this study
This trial is more than twice the size of the largest trial in S aureus 
bacteraemia to date, is a 50% increase in the total number of 
cases recruited in randomised trials of S aureus bacteraemia 
treatment over the past 50 years, and provides 95% CIs around 
our estimates of no difference between rifampicin and placebo 
that lie within 7·5%—smaller than the 10% non-inferiority 
margins recommended by licensing authorities for antibiotic 
trials. Although designed to test the superiority of rifampicin, the 
trial provides convincing evidence of non-inferiority of rifampicin 
to placebo—ie, convincing evidence of absence of benefit.
Implications of all the available evidence
Although adjunctive rifampicin does not reduce mortality from 
S aureus bacteraemia, it might reduce the risk of disease 
recurrence, but our results suggest this effect had no impact on 
short-term or long-term mortality. Furthermore, rifampicin 
complicates other drug treatment. We consider that adjunctive 
rifampicin provides no overall benefit over standard antibiotic 
therapy in adults with S aureus bacteraemia.

written informed consent. Patients were recruited by the 
study team and in consultation with the hospital team 
responsible for the patient’s in-hospital care.
Randomisation and masking
Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either 
rifampicin or placebo for 2 weeks, plus standard backbone 
antibiotic therapy as chosen by the attending physician. 
Randomisation was stratified by centre. A computer-
generated sequential randomisation list using variably 
sized permuted blocks was prepared by the trial statistician, 
and incorporated securely into the online trial database. 
The list was concealed until allocation by the prevention of 
access by any database users through login-based per-
missions; after eligibility was confirmed, researchers at the 
local hospitals then did the randomisation.
Trial doctors and nurses, and other nurses (except any 
ward nurses reconstituting intravenous trial drug) and 
doctors who cared for the participants during normal 
clinical care, were masked to the group allocations and 
treatment; hospital pharmacists and trial statisticians 
were unmasked. Trial centres were supplied with 
individual participant blinded treatment packs, which 
were labelled only with a trial number, and contained 
either active rifampicin (300-mg capsules) or identical 
placebo capsules sufficient for 14 days of treatment at 
900 mg, according to the randomisation list. Rifampicin 
capsules were over-encapsulated to make them indis-
tinguishable from placebo. For participants requiring 
intravenous treatment, hospital pharmacists dispensed 
rifampicin for infusion or saline from local pharmacy 
stock, with an opaque cover to mask the treatment.
Rifampicin can turn urine (and tears and sweat) 
reddish-orange—an effect impossible to safely replicate 
with a placebo. Therefore, urine discolouration might 
have been a potential source of treatment unmasking, 
particularly of the participant; however, this effect is 
variable both within and between individuals. The 
opportunity for physicians to examine the urine at the 
bedside only occurred in participants with urinary 
catheters. Catheters were not required by all participants 
and were removed at the earliest opportunity. The 
success of blinding was assessed at the final 12-week 
visit, at which time physicians and participants were 
asked which treatment they believed they had received.
Procedures
As decided by the attending physician, 600 mg or 900 mg 
of rifampicin was given per day according to weight, 
either as a divided dose given twice per day or a single 
dose given once per day, orally or intravenously for 14 days 
or until cessation of backbone antibiotic treatment for the 
bacteraemia—whichever occurred first. Information on 
all antibiotics received from randomisation to 12 weeks 
was collected, but not according to specific indication. 
Consultation with an infection specialist, with advice on 
management to non-specialists caring for the trial 
participants, followed normal clinical practice at all sites. 
Attending physicians could change backbone antibiotics 
according to clinical need and advice of the infection 
specialist, and could use open-label rifampicin after 
14 days. In cases judged clinically necessary, participants 
could stop the masked trial drug before the end of 
the 2-week period to use open-label rifampicin, with 
participants continuing follow-up off study drug, on 
study. Primary antibiotic treatment and duration was 
defined by complete cessation of all antibiotics for 2 days, 
with the exception of vancomycin, in which case 
intermittent dosing up to 1 week was allowed. The 
cessation of vancomycin was defined by adding the 
number of days between the last two doses to the date of 
the final dose.
Participants left the trial after 12 weeks, with clinical 
assessments in hospital on days 0, 3, 7, 10, and 14, and 
then once per week until either discharge or week 12—
whichever occurred first. Blood cultures were done on 
days 0, 3, and 7; C-reactive protein concentration was 
measured on days 3, 7, 10, and 14; and liver function tests 
were done on days 3 and 10. Ideally, the final visit at 
week 12 was done face-to-face, but could also be over the 
telephone or via general practitioner records; this visit 
occurred any time after week 11. Consent was obtained to 
confirm vital status on all participants at trial closure.
Outcomes
The primary outcome in the final protocol was time to 
bacteriologically confirmed treatment failure or disease 
recurrence, or death (all-cause), from randomisation to 
12 weeks. Bacteriologically confirmed treatment failure 
was defined as symptoms and signs of infection ongoing 
for more than 14 days from randomisation, with S aureus 
isolated from blood or another sterile site (eg, joint 
fluid and pus from tissue). Bacteriologically confirmed 
disease recurrence was S aureus isolated from a sterile 
site after more than 7 days of apparent clinical 
improvement. As defined, treatment failure reflected 
both the speed of killing of S aureus and sterilisation of 
infected foci and blood, and both treatment failure and 
disease recurrence reflected the risk of dissemination 
and metastatic infection. Secondary outcomes were time 
to all-cause mortality from randomisation to 2 weeks; 
time to death or clinically defined treatment failure or 
disease recurrence from randomisation to 12 weeks; 
duration of bacteraemia (to assess whether rifampicin 
was associated with faster killing of S aureus and 
sterilisation of infected foci and blood); grade 3–4 
adverse events (AEs; graded following the Common 
Toxicity Criteria for AEs 4.0313), serious adverse events 
(SAEs), antibiotic or trial-drug modifying AEs (all AEs 
reported, primary comparisons based on time to first 
event); the proportion for whom treatment was modi-
fied (including concomitant medications) because of 
drug interactions; and the proportion who developed 
rifampicin-resistant S aureus (from sterile sites). All

potential treatment failures or disease recurrences 
and deaths were adjudicated by an independent review 
committee masked to the treatment.
Statistical analysis
The trial was originally designed with two co-primary 
outcomes: all-cause mortality by 14 days and bacteri-
ologically confirmed treatment failure or disease re-
currence, or death, by week 12. Assuming 80% power, a 
two-sided α of 0·025 (to adjust for multiple testing given 
two co-primary outcomes), and a 10% loss to follow-up by 
week 12, 920 participants were needed to detect a 
30% relative reduction in treatment failure or disease 
recurrence, or death, from 35% to 25%—an absolute 
difference of 10%, corresponding to a number needed to 
treat of ten. Assuming 80% power, a two-sided α of 
0·025, and a 4% loss to follow-up by 14 days (as most 
participants remained in hospital during this time), 
940 participants were needed to detect a 45% relative 
reduction in mortality from 16% to 9%—an absolute 
difference of 7%, corresponding to a number-needed-to-
treat of 14. Therefore, the total sample size was originally 
940 participants.
Recruitment to the trial was slower than anticipated. To 
facilitate successful completion of the trial, and at the 
request of the trial funder, after 3 years of recruitment 
the 14-day mortality was changed from a co-primary to a 
secondary outcome. 12-week bacteriologically confirmed 
treatment failure or disease recurrence, or death, 
therefore became the sole primary outcome, with a 
consequent decrease in sample size (due to increase in 
the two-sided α [type I error] from 0·025 [two co-primary 
outcomes] to 0·05 [one primary outcome]). With 12-week 
bacteriologically confirmed treatment failure or disease 
recurrence, or death, as the sole primary outcome, the 
total sample size became 770 participants (α=0·05, other 
assumptions as above).
Interim data were reviewed by an independent data 
monitoring committee (four annual meetings) using 
Haybittle-Peto criterion (p<0·001). Randomised groups 
were compared following the principle of intention-to-
treat (including all follow-up regardless of changes 
to treatment) using log-rank tests for time-to-event 
outcomes, exact tests for binary outcomes, and 
generalised estimating equations with independent 
working correlation for global tests of repeated measures. 
Primary analyses were not stratified by centre. A deep 
infection focus was defined as infection of implanted 
vascular device, native or prosthetic heart value, native or 
prosthetic bone or joint, or deep tissue infection or

abscess (including vertebral bone or disc or other bone 
infection, epidural or intraspinal empyema, infected 
intravascular thrombus and brain infection). Additional 
details are provided in the appendix pp 4–7
. Analyses 
were done with the use of Stata version 14.2.
The trial was registered, number ISRCTN37666216.
Role of the funding source
The funder had no role in the study design (other than 
requesting a change from two co-primary outcomes to 
one primary outcome because of slow recruitment, as 
described earlier); in the collection, analysis, and 
interpretation of data; in the writing of the report; and in 
the decision to submit the paper for publication. AS and 
ASW had complete access to the data. GET was 
responsible for the decision to submit the manuscript for 
publication.
Results
Between Dec 10, 2012, and Oct 25, 2016, 770 participants 
from 29 UK hospital groups were randomly assigned to 
add placebo (n=396) or rifampicin (n=374) to their 
backbone antibiotic treatment (figure 1). 12 participants 
were randomly assigned (eight to placebo and four to 
rifampicin) in error (ie, the participant should not have 
been assigned and never received trial drug) and were 
excluded, leaving 758 (388 placebo and 370 rifampicin) 
participants in the analyses.
Baseline characteristics were similar between random-
ised groups (table 1; appendix p 14). 495 (65%) were men, 
with a median age of 65 (IQR 50–76) years, and a Charlson 
comorbidity score of 2 (0–3). 70 (9%) participants were in 
an intensive care unit. Mean C-reactive protein was 
164 (SE 3·7) mg/L. 127 (17%) participants had consent 
provided by a legal representative because of incapacity. 
485 (64%) S aureus infections were community acquired, 
132 (17%) were nosocomial, and 47 (6%) were caused by 
MRSA. No patients were known to have rifampicin-
resistant S aureus bacteraemia at randomisation. The 
initial focus was deep in 301 (40%) participants, including 
33 (4%) with endocarditis and 14 (2%) with infected 
prostheses; 130 (17%) infections were due to infected 
central or peripheral lines, or both; 138 (18%) infections 
were associated with skin or soft tissue infections, or 
both; another type of focus was identified in 49 (6%) 
participants and not established in 139 (18%) participants. 
At randomisation, the median time for which participants 
had received active antibiotics was 62 (IQR 42–75) h.
744 (98%) participants initiated blinded trial drug a 
median of 68 (IQR 48–85) h after starting active antibiotics 
for the current infection (table 2). Participants continued 
treatment with the trial drug for a median of 12·6 
(IQR 6·0–13·2) days in the rifampicin group versus 13·0 
(IQR 11·3–13·5) days in the placebo group (p<0·0001; 
primarily due to antibiotic-modifying AEs and drug–
drug interactions, discussed later). The proportion of 
participants who reported missing any doses ranged from 
18 (9%) of 190 to 58 (16%) of 357 but did not differ between 
randomised groups (global p=0·72; appendix p 8).
Various backbone active antibiotics were used (table 2); 
however, flucloxacillin was given to 619 (82%) participants, 
and vancomycin or teicoplanin to 380 (50%) at some 
point in the primary treatment course. The median 
number of antibiotics used (3 [IQR 2–4]) and the duration 
of anti-staphylococcal treatment (29 [IQR 18–45] days) 
was similar between groups (table 2). 32 (9%) participants

group used open-label rifampicin (p=0·04), initiated a 
median of 14 (IQR 7–18) days after randomisation (table 2; 
appendix p 15). 159 partici 
pants who received placebo 
versus 142 who received rifampicin had a deep focus, 
which was drained or removed in 35 (22%) versus 
29 (20%), a median of 5 (IQR 2–12) days and 3 (IQR 1–6) 
days after randomisation (appendix p 16).
22 (3%) participants withdrew consent. At the 12-week 
visit, only 39 (5%) participants had unknown vital status 
and 65 (9%) were not assessed for signs or symptoms of 
S aureus infection (including consent withdrawals). 
23 (3%) participants were still in hospital at week 12; 
the median duration of initial hospital admission 
was 21 (IQR 14–50) days in the placebo group 
versus 22 (13–43) days in the rifampicin group (p=0·80). 
94 (24%) participants in the placebo group versus 
83 (22%) in the rifampicin group were re-admitted after 
discharge and before week 12.
By week 12, bacteriologically confirmed treatment 
failure or disease recurrence, or death, had occurred in 
62 (17%) participants in the rifampicin group versus 
71 (18%) in the placebo group (absolute risk difference 
[RD] –1·4%, 95% CI –7·0 to 4·3; hazard ratio [HR] 0·96, 
0·68–1·35, p=0·81; figure 2; per protocol analysis, 
appendix p 7). In exploratory post-hoc analyses comparing 
rifampicin with placebo (table 3), four (1%) versus 
five (1%) treatment failures (competing risks p=0·82), 
three (1%) versus 16 (4%) disease recurrences (competing 
risks p=0·01), and 55 (15%) versus 50 (13%) deaths 
without bacteriological treatment failure or disease 
recurrence (competing risks p=0·30) were reported. The 
number needed to treat to prevent one bacteriologically 
confirmed recurrence was 29.
Of 28 failures or recurrences in which S aureus was 
isolated from a sterile site, paired baseline and failure or 
recurrence isolates were stored for 11 (39%). All failure 
and recurrence isolates were whole-genome sequenced 
and within 12 single nucleotide variants of the baseline 
isolate (median 1 [IQR 1–6], range 0–12).
Subgroup analyses according to time between starting 
active antibiotics and trial drug, meticillin resistance, 
and foci of infection (deep vs not deep), suggested 
no heterogeneity in absence of effect of rifampicin 
(pheterogeneity=0·42, 0·07, 0·10; figure 2). The effect of 
rifampicin varied significantly, according to the initial 
antibiotic given at randomisation, with some suggestion 
of benefit in those with meticillin-sensitive infection 
treated with flucloxacillin alone (pheterogeneity=0·01, appendix 
p 9), but across none of 16 other subgroup analyses 
(pheterogeneity>0·05, appendix pp 9, 10).
Clinically defined treatment failure or disease re-
currence, or death, occurred in 76 (21%) participants in 
the rifampicin group versus 86 (22%) in the placebo group 
(RD –1·4%, 95% CI –7·4 to 4·7; HR 0·97, 0·71–1·32, 
p=0·84; figure 2). In exploratory post-hoc analyses 
comparing the rifampicin and placebo groups, 23 (6%) 
versus 25 (6%) failures (competing risks p=0·97), 
eight (2%) versus 23 (6%) recurrences (competing risks 
p=0·01), and 45 (12%) versus 38 (10%) deaths without 
clinically defined treatment failure or disease recurrence 
(competing risks p=0·22) were reported (table 3). 
The number needed to treat to prevent one clinically 
confirmed disease recurrence was 26. The endpoint 
review committee adjudicated that failure of infection 
focus management was implicated in 24 (77%) of 
31 failures or recurrences on rifampicin versus 38 (79%) of 
48 on placebo; including five (16%) versus 12 (25%) in 
which the focus was not recognised (table 3). 34 (9%) 
of 370 participants in the rifampicin group received 
antibiotics after the primary treatment course, versus 
60 (15%) of 388 in the placebo group (p=0·01).

By week 12, 56 (15%) participants in the rifampicin 
group versus 56 (14%) in the placebo group had died 
(RD 1·0%, 95% CI –4·3 to 6·2; HR 1·10, 0·76–1·60; 
p=0·60; figure 2). 25 (7%) participants in the rifampicin 
group versus 17 (4%) in the placebo group died by week 2 
(HR 1·60, 95% CI 0·86–2·95, p=0·13). Of the reported 
deaths, 14 in the rifampicin group versus 16 in the placebo 
group were definitely S aureus-related, 14 versus 12 were 
probably S aureus-related, and eight versus four were 
possibly S aureus-related (appendix p 17). 18 deaths in the 
rifampicin group versus 23 in the placebo group were not 
attributed to S aureus (remainder unattributable; overall 
p=0·64). There was no difference in long-term (post-
week 12) survival between the groups (p=0·69; figure 3).
There was no evidence that duration of bacteraemia 
was significantly shorter in those randomly assigned to 
rifampicin (global p=0·66; appendix p 11). C-reactive 
protein concentration decreased significantly in both 
groups, but with smaller decreases in rifampicin 
participants (global p=0·001, appendix p 12). Two (1%) 
participants 
who 
received 
rifampicin 
developed 
rifampicin-resistant S aureus bacteraemia 7 days and 
42 days after randomisation (p=0·24; appendix p 7); one 
participant had rifampicin-resistant S aureus isolated 
from another sterile site after randomisation (a 
pacemaker lead removed 4 h after the first trial drug 
dose, see appendix p 7).
By week 12, 101 (27%) participants in the rifampicin 
group versus 94 (24%) in the placebo group had 112 
versus 116 SAEs (HR 1·21, 95% CI 0·92–1·61, 
log-rank p=0·17; appendix pp 20, 21). Two participants

had non-fatal hepatic failure (appendix p 7). No between-
group differences in changes in alanine transaminase 
(global p=0·18; appendix p 12) or alkaline phosphatase 
(global p=0·11) were observed (appendix p 13). Bilirubin 
significantly increased in the rifampicin group at day 3 
(p<0·0001; global p<0·0001; appendix p 12).
129 (35%) participants in the rifampicin group versus 
131 (34%) in the placebo group had 209 versus 193 grade 3–4 
AEs (HR 1·12, 95% CI 0·88–1·43, log-rank p=0·36; table 4). 
Most notable was a trend towards more renal grade 3–4 
AEs with rifampicin, which occurred in 19 (5%) versus 
nine (2%; p=0·053) participants, with 17 versus six being 
acute kidney injury. 63 (17%) participants who received 
rifampicin versus 39 (10%) who received placebo had 
89 versus 52 antibiotic-modifying AEs (subdistribution 
HR 1·78, 95% CI 1·20–2·65, log-rank p=0·004, appendix 
pp 20, 26). Gastrointestinal disorders (24 vs eight; p=0·003) 
and renal or urinary disorders (eight vs one; p=0·02) were 
more common with rifampicin than placebo. 24 (6%) 
participants in the rifampicin group versus six (2%) in the 
placebo group had drug interactions (p=0·0005); 13 versus 
four led to discontinuation of trial drug (p=0·03), 14 versus 
three led to grade 1–2 AEs (p=0·006), and five versus two 
to grade 3–4 AEs (p=0·27).
At least one individual was unmasked for 14 participants 
(nine rifampicin, five placebo). In two cases, a non-trial 
physician or ward pharmacist were unmasked for 
participant safety, and in three cases, the research nurse 
was unmasked.
At the final 12-week visit, physicians and participants 
were asked which treatment they believed had been 
administered. 203 (84%) of 243 physicians of participants 
randomly assigned to the rifampicin group reported that 
they genuinely had no idea versus 249 (89%) of 
279 physicians of participants in the placebo group 
(p=0·08); 32 (13%) and 17 (6%) identified the correct 
allocation. By contrast, 113 (57%) of 199 participants 
randomly assigned to the rifampicin group reported that 
they genuinely had no idea versus 159 (69%) of 
229 participants randomly assigned to placebo (p=0·007); 
72 (36%) and 35 (15%) identified the correct allocation.

bacteraemia, aimed to establish whether rifampicin added 
to standard backbone antibiotics for up to 14 days reduced 
bacteriologically confirmed treatment failure or disease 
recurrence, or death, by 12 weeks. We found that although 
rifampicin did not have a significant effect on any of 
the composite primary or secondary efficacy measures, 
including mortality, duration of bacteraemia, or develop-
ment of rifampicin-resistant S aureus, it was associated 
with a small but significant reduction in bacteriologically 
and clinically defined disease recurrences.
Our trial highlights the severity and heterogeneity of 
S aureus bacteraemia. Participants were mostly older 
adults with comorbidities, 9% of whom were en-
rolled in an intensive care unit. Most (64%) infections 
were acquired in the community, and 6% were caused 
by MRSA, reflecting substantial improvements in 
prevention and control of hospital-acquired S aureus and 
MRSA infection in the UK over the past decade, and the 
consequent decline in infections.14 A deep infection focus 
was present at baseline in 301 (40%) participants—
around half with endocarditis, orthopaedic or intra-
vascular devices, or osteoarticular infections—and 
139 (18%) had no established infection focus. Therefore, 
a substantial proportion had what could be considered as 
uncomplicated disease.
The choice and duration of backbone antibiotics varied 
substantially between participants, but 82% received 
flucloxacillin and 50% received a glycopeptide at some 
point during their primary treatment. The choice of first-
line anti-staphylococcal penicillin for the treatment of 
MSSA infections varies by country. In the UK and 
Australia, flucloxacillin is used; whereas, in the USA, 
other agents, such as nafcillin and cloxacillin, are 
preferred. There is no evidence to support clinically 
relevant differential anti-staphylococcal activity between 
these antibiotics,15,16 and we therefore believe our results 
are generalisable across countries, regardless of their 
chosen anti-staphylococcal penicillin. The use of other 
antibiotics (including open-label rifampicin) and the 
total duration of active antibiotic therapy (median 
29 days) was similar between randomised groups. Fewer 
rifampicin-treated than placebo-treated participants were 
restarted on antibiotics after the primary treatment 
course, possibly reflecting the lower recurrence rate in 
this group.
Planned subgroup analysis suggested the effect of 
rifampicin might have varied according to antibiotics 
used at randomisation, with any benefit restricted to 
those with meticillin-sensitive infection treated with 
flucloxacillin alone. The clinical significance of this result

is uncertain. The effect was lost if flucloxacillin was used 
with vancomycin or another antibiotic, or if the subgroups 
were defined by antibiotic class. With 20 subgroups 
analysed, one statistically significant association might 
have occurred by chance.
Our results refute the hypothesis that adjunctive 
rifampicin enhances S aureus killing in blood and thereby 
reduces the risk of dissemination and death.17 Bacterial 
clearance in blood was similar in the two treatment groups, 
and all-cause mortality was unaffected by rifampicin. Even 
deaths adjudicated as definitely or probably due to S aureus 
(50%) were not reduced by rifampicin. However, 12-week 
all-cause mortality (15%) was substantially lower than was 
reported in a large multicentre case-series (29%),2 although 
was similar to the trial of daptomycin in S aureus 
bacteraemia.18 This similarity might be explained by some 
severely unwell patients being unable to enter the trial, 
including the 129 patients who were not enrolled because 
they either died or were considered too unwell for active 
treatment (figure 1). Participants might also have benefited 
from regular infection specialist consults, mandatory for 
the trial and associated with improved S aureus bacteraemia 
outcomes.19 It highlights the importance of basing sample 
size calculations on previous trials wherever possible.
Our findings provide some support for another 
hypothesis—that rifampicin enhances the sterilisation of 
deep infection foci and thus reduces disease recurrences.20 
The small but statistically significant reduction in 
recurrences in the rifampicin group indicates the drug 
had some biological activity, although its clinical 
significance is debatable. The numbers needed to treat to 
prevent bacteriologically and clinically defined disease 
recurrences were 29 and 26, and both short-term 
and long-term mortality was unaltered (figures 2, 3). 
This modest effect needs to be balanced against the 
complications of rifampicin use and its toxicity. 306 (11%) 
of 2896 screened patients were not enrolled because of 
predicted drug interactions or pre-existing liver disease, 
and although the number of participants who had SAEs 
was similar between the groups, there were significantly 
more antibiotic-modifying AEs and drug interactions in 
the rifampicin group. AEs were predominantly gastro-
intestinal disorders and renal impairment. In addition, 
the independent, masked review committee adjudicated 
that recurrences were more commonly caused by failure 
to recognise or remove the primary infection focus than a 
failure of antibiotic treatment (table 3). Therefore, 
rifampicin might assist in the sterilisation of deep S aureus 
infection foci and prevent a few recurrences, but it does 
not replace the need to define and, when possible, drain or 
remove the infection focus.
The strengths of the trial are its placebo-controlled, 
multicentre and pragmatic design, which provides 
clinically relevant, generalisable findings. It is also the 
largest trial to date that examines S aureus bacteraemia 
treatment. Its limitations reflect the many challenges of 
performing trials in acutely unwell patients with severe 
bacterial infections.21 Disease severity and heterogeneity, 
and the requirement to randomly assign patients within 
96 h of the start of antibiotic therapy, increased the 
proportion of ineligible patients and slowed recruitment. 
Only 770 (27%) of those screened were enrolled and 
664 (31%) not enrolled had received more than 96 h of 
antibiotics. 232 (11%) subjects were not enrolled because 
rifampicin was considered mandatory; although this 
information was only collected as an exclusion criteria 
without additional details, anecdotal evidence indicated 
many of these patients had prosthetic-related infections. 
These exclusions might have reduced the clinical effect of 
rifampicin and the relevance of the findings to those with 
bacteraemia associated with infected prostheses who might 
benefit more from rifampicin.9 Additional limitations 
include possible heterogeneity arising from the range 
of recruited participants per centre (1–164), and the 
observation that approximately 30% of patients either 
initiated open-label rifampicin or stopped the blinded trial 
drug early, predominantly for drug–drug interactions or 
AEs. However, these changes are also likely to happen in 
normal clinical practice. Additionally, vital status or signs 
and symptoms, or both, could not be ascertained in 
approximately 9% of patients at the 12-week follow-up.
Although few participants had MRSA bacteraemia, we 
found no evidence of heterogeneity in the effect of 
rifampicin in this subgroup, which, if anything, did worse 
with rifampicin than placebo (figure 2). Similarly, although 
treatment with rifampicin was started anywhere between 
0 h and 96 h after active antibiotics (meaning some patients 
could theoretically have had a clinically meaningful delay 
in starting rifampicin, which could have affected efficacy), 
we found no evidence of such an effect in subgroup 
analyses, based on time from randomisation to initiation 
of rifampicin or placebo as a categorical or continuous 
factor (figure 2), supporting wider generalisability. Non-
significant trends toward differences in other subgroups of 
particular interest, including infections with a deep focus, 
which comprised approximately 40% of the total patient 
population, need to be interpreted carefully given the large 
numbers of significance tests done.22
On the basis of a small systematic review,11 the trial was 
originally powered to detect an absolute difference of 10% 
in bacteriological treatment failure or death (from 
35% to 25%) and a 7% absolute reduction in mortality 
from 16% to 9%. Although slow recruitment meant the 
sample size was reduced, the 770 participants included are 
more than double the number in the biggest previous trial 
in S aureus bacteraemia,23 and is a 50% increase in the total 
numbers of cases recruited in randomised trials over the 
past 50 years. The 95% CIs around our estimates of the 
difference between rifampicin and placebo lie within 
7·5%, which is smaller than the 10% non-inferiority 
margins recommended by licensing authorities for 
antibiotic trials and commonly used in other infections, 
such as HIV. The use of an active comparator would 
have conclusively shown non-inferiority of rifampicin.

Although designed to test superiority of rifampicin, the 
trial thus provides con 
vincing evidence of non-inferiority 
of rifampicin to placebo; that is, convincing evidence of 
absence of benefit. A small proportion (13%) of partici-
pants used open-label rifampicin in the placebo group, but 
per-protocol analyses confirmed this well estimated 
absence of benefit of rifampicin over placebo.
In summary, adjunctive rifampicin did not improve 
outcomes from S aureus bacteraemia, with the exception of 
a modest reduction in disease recurrence. Given rifampicin 
had no effect on short-term or long-term mortality, 
substantially complicated other drug treatment, and 
widespread use risks increasing resistance among S aureus 
and other bacteria (eg, Mycobacterium tuberculosis), we 
consider that adjunctive rifampicin provides no overall 
benefit over standard antibiotic therapy in adults with 
S aureus bacteraemia.
