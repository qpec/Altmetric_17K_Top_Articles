Cerebral organoids are 3D stem cell-derived models that can be utilized to study the human
brain. The current consensus is that cerebral organoids consist of cells derived from the
neuroectodermal lineage. This limits their value and applicability, as mesodermal-derived
microglia are important players in neural development and disease. Remarkably, here we
show that microglia can innately develop within a cerebral organoid model and display their
characteristic ramified morphology. The transcriptome and response to inflammatory sti-
mulation of these organoid-grown microglia closely mimic the transcriptome and response of
adult microglia acutely isolated from post mortem human brain tissue. In addition, organoid-
grown microglia mediate phagocytosis and synaptic material is detected inside them. In all,
our study characterizes a microglia-containing organoid model that represents a valuable tool
for studying the interplay between microglia, macroglia, and neurons in human brain
development and disease.

icroglia are the resident innate immune cells of the
central nervous system (CNS). While microglia origi-
nate from the mesoderm lineage, other CNS cells like
neurons and astrocytes are derived from neuroectodermal
progenitors1,2. Besides their immune functions, microglia also
control the number of neuronal precursor cells, synapse forma-
tion, and synapse elimination3–6. Impaired interaction between
microglia, neurons, and astrocytes is increasingly linked to neu-
rodegenerative and neurodevelopmental disorders, such as Alz-
heimer’s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), autism, and
schizophrenia7–10. The majority of studies on neuron-glia inter-
actions are performed in rodents, due to a lack of adequate
human model systems that recapitulate the development of
microglia in vivo and the interplay between microglia, macroglia,
and neurons in a 3D context. Human model systems, however,
will be vital to understand how neuron-glia interactions impact
human CNS development, physiology, and pathology.
Recently, stem cell-derived organoid models offer the possibi-
lity to study cellular development and inter-cellular interactions
within a 3D human brain microenvironment11. Organoids are
generated by culturing embryonic stem cells (ESCs) or induced
pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) into embryoid bodies with the
potential to develop progenitors from all the three germinal
layers: endoderm, ectoderm, and mesoderm. The embryoid body
is pushed into a specific tissue fate, like CNS, by complementing
the cell culture medium with growth factors and/or inhibitors.
Due to their self-organizing capacity, cell aggregates will then
develop into CNS organoids consisting of neuronal sub-types and
macroglia, forming specialized CNS-areas such as cortex, hip-
pocampus, and retina11–13. A reported limitation of CNS orga-
noid protocols is that they drive cells into the neuroectoderm
lineage by inhibiting mesoderm and endoderm formation. Con-
sequently, CNS organoids have been suggested to lack the com-
plete combination of cells derived from different germ layers that
are present in the brain in vivo, including microglia11,14.
Dual-SMAD inhibition is commonly used to quickly induce
neuroectoderm formation in directed differentiation protocols15.
However, Lancaster and colleagues published a protocol to gen-
erate cerebral organoids without the use of any inhibitors or
molecular pathway manipulators12,16. This approach led to the
first 3D organoid model containing distinct brain regions like
hippocampus, retina, and different cortical domains12,16. Their
study reports that non-neuronal cell types are expelled from
inside the organoids upon matrigel embedment and that the
remaining cells are from the neuronal lineage17. The lack of dual-
SMAD inhibition in cerebral organoid generation might explain
why Quadrato et al.18 recently reported the presence of
mesoderm-derived progenitors in this model. We hypothesized
that these mesodermal progenitors are able to differentiate into
mature microglia instructed by the CNS microenvironment
provided by neuroectodermal cells. Our results show that cells
with a typical microglia molecular phenotype, morphology, and
function are present in human cerebral organoids. This 3D
organoid model in which microglia, macroglia, and neurons are
present is important for studying microglia development, but also
for studying neuron-glia interactions in human brain develop-
ment and disease.
Results
Cerebral organoids contain progenitors from all germ layers.
Cerebral organoids were generated from human iPSCs according
to the protocol described by Lancaster et al.17 with some minor
modifications (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Table 1). Two of the
three iPSC lines used for the organoid cultures have previously
been described by us (iPSC 1, 3)19 and iPSC 5 was similarly
generated and characterized (Supplementary Fig. 1a–h; Table 1).
Ectodermal (PAX6), mesodermal (brachyury), and endodermal
(AFP) progenitors were present at an early stage of organoid
development (day 17; Fig. 1b). The presence of neuronal archi-
tecture and of astrocytes was confirmed by using a range of
markers at day 31 (Supplementary Fig. 1i–p). Cleaved-caspase 3
immunostaining at several timepoints and batches (iPSC 1, 3, and
5; at day 17, 38, 52, and 66) showed constant sparse cell death in
the organoids.
Mesodermal progenitors develop into microglia-like cells. Next,
temporal expression of the mesodermal marker brachyury and
the classical microglia marker IBA-1 was examined to assess if the
mesodermal cells differentiate into microglia. Brachyury+ cells
were present on day 17, 24, and no longer detected at day 52.
IBA-1+ cells were detectable in low numbers on day 24 and had
populated the organoids at day 52 (Fig. 1c). This transition took
place around day 24, as at this timepoint a population of cells co-
expressed both IBA-1 and brachyury (Fig. 1d). IBA-1+ cells were
initially present in clusters distributed at specific sites in the
organoid (day 31; Fig. 1e), but at later stages were found
throughout the organoid (day 52; Fig. 1e). The fraction IBA-1+
cells within organoids showed limited variation between batches,
timepoints, and donors (Supplementary Fig. 2a–c), and microglia
quantity was positively correlated with TUJ1 expression (Sup-
plementary Fig. 2d). Furthermore, microglia-containing orga-
noids demonstrated proper neuronal development and cortical
layer organization, based on expression of NEUN, PAX6, CTIP2,
and TBR1 (Supplementary Fig. 2e). In rodents, microglia have a
rounded morphology (amoeboid) at the moment they invade the
brain parenchyma. At later stages, these cells develop character-
istic ramifications. This process of differentiation is mirrored in
the human organoids. IBA-1+ cells had a round morphology up
to day 31, and showed a significant increase (Mann–Whitney
U = 0, p = 0.03) in ramifications by day 52, here shown by an
increase in perimeter (Fig. 1f, g). Microglial complexity pro-
gressed in time as IBA-1+ cells showed further ramification at day
66 (Fig. 1h).
Microglia-specific molecular signature in cerebral organoids.
To determine whether the microglia within cerebral organoids
developed in analogy to microglia in vivo, we assessed the
expression of genes crucial for microglia development and
function. RUNX1, a transcription factor involved in microglial
development20, was first expressed at an early stage of organoid
development around the time of matrigel embedment (day 13), as
were factors known to drive microglia development in vivo (IL34,
CSF1, and TGFB1) (Fig. 2a). RUNX1 regulates the microglia
development genes SPI1 (PU.1) and CSF1R20, which we found
expressed at day 24 (Fig. 2a). At this timepoint a clear increase in
expression of other classical microglia markers was observed, i.e.,
AIF1/IBA-1, CD68, ITGAM/CD11b (Fig. 2a), IRF8, TGFBR1,
TGFBR2, TREM2, CX3CR1, HLADRA, C1QA, and PTPRC/
CD4521–23 (Supplementary Fig. 3a). Microglial identity was fur-
ther supported by complete co-expression of IBA-1 with the
nuclear marker PU.1 (Fig. 2b) and major overlap with the
expression of the microglia/macrophage marker CD68 (Fig. 2c) at
day 52.
Taken together our results suggest that mesodermal progeni-
tors within the cerebral organoids can develop into cells with a
microglial
phenotype,

organoid-grown
microglia (oMG).
The transcriptomes of oMG and adult microglia are similar. To
further validate the microglia phenotype of oMG, we performed

 unsupervised hierarchical clustering, Spearman correlation coef-
ficients, and principal component analyses (PCA) (Fig. 3a, b;
Supplementary Fig. 4c) showed that both at day 38 and day 52
oMG closely resemble adult MG1. Further analysis revealed that
oMG at both timepoints express well-established microglia
markers (i.e., AIF1, SPI1, ITGAM, RUNX1, TLR4, CSF1R, IRF8)
(Fig. 3c). We found that expression of part of these genes, like
AIF1 and RUNX1, is comparable between oMG and MG1, but for
some the levels are threefold (PTPRC or CX3CR1) or even
10–100-fold different (TREM2, P2RY12, TMEM119) (Fig. 3d). To
analyze whether microglia continued to mature within the
organoid, we also analyzed the expression of these markers at
119 days in culture. Microglia from iPSC donors 1, 3, and 5 at day
119 vs. day 52 showed an increase in expression of all these
selected typical microglia genes AIF1, RUNX1, PTPRC, CX3CR1,
TREM2, P2RY12, and TMEM119 (Fig. 3e).
The effect of the organoid CNS microenvironment on the
development and differentiation of oMG was further evaluated by
comparing the transcriptional
landscape of these cells to
previously
published
microglia
datasets.
For
this
purpose
transcriptomic data from fetal microglia (fetal MG)24, a 2-
dimensional (2D) iPSC-microglia model (iPSC MG 1)24, and data
from other acutely isolated adult microglia (adult MG 2)25 was
included. The transcriptomes were compared for all available
transcriptome data, but also using a panel of transcription factors
that are expressed by microglia in vivo26. The study by Gosselin
et al.26 describes that in the absence of other CNS cell types,
microglia
lose
expression
of
these
adult
microglia-related
transcription factor families. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering
of all available transcriptome data revealed that both day 38 and
day 52 oMG cluster with adult MG1 and previously published
adult MG2, whereas iPSC MG clustered with fetal MG (Fig. 3f).
Interestingly, iPSC MG and fetal MG first clustered with iPSC
and fibroblasts prior to clustering with the oMG and adult MG 1
and 2 (Fig. 3f). Despite this clustering, Spearman correlation
coefficients showed that the transcriptomic profiles of all
microglia and microglia-like cells were relatively similar (ρ =
0.7 ± 0.07) (Supplementary Fig. 4d). The Spearman correlation
analyses of the transcriptomes of oMG day 52, adult MG1, iPSC
MG and fetal MG by using microglia-specific transcription
factors26 (Supplementary Table 2) showed a strong correlation
between iPSC MG and fetal MG (ρ = 0.96), whereas transcription
factor profiles of oMG correlated most with those of adult MG1
(ρ = 0.8). The correlation between adult MG1 and fetal MG was
low (ρ = 0.37) in this analysis (Supplementary Fig. 4e).
Taken together, transcriptome comparisons showed that oMG
strongly correlate with adult MG1 and 2, whereas the 2D iPSC
MG model highly correlate with fetal MG.
To further analyze differences in gene expression between
oMG and adult MG, we analyzed transcriptomic differences
between day oMG and adult MG1 (Supplementary Fig. 4f–h).
Sample variability and size resulted in high Log2fold changes and

embedment they have a smooth surface (i), which changes into a surface showing typical budding of the organoid 4 days after matrigel embedment (ii).

 therefore shrinkage correction was performed. 1220 genes
remained that were significantly upregulated in oMG day 52
and 1271 genes in MG1 (FDR < 0.05) whereas 2400 genes were
significantly upregulated in oMG at day 38 and 2070 in adult
MG1 (Supplementary Fig. 4i, j). Top 100 upregulated genes in
oMG day 52 included FN1, CDH4, COL1A2 and COL3A1 for
oMG and, CDHR1, CXCR1 and ACKR2 for adult MG1
(Supplementary Data 1). Functional gene classification with
Panther GO-Slim27 on the top 100 upregulated genes in both day
52 oMG and adult MG showed that the significantly upregulated
genes in both samples belong to similar biological processes
suggesting only subtle differences between oMG and adult MG.

enriched pathways in adult MG1 vs. oMG, whereas oMG showed

 enrichment for “collagen catabolic process”, “extracellular matrix
organization”, “negative chemotaxis”, “positive regulation of
synapse assembly”, and “endodermal cell differentiation” com-
pared to adult MG1 (Supplementary Data 2). Myeloid function-
related terms were detected by GO-pathway analysis of common
genes (between adult MG1 and day 52 oMG), such as “nervous
system development”, “interleukin-12-mediated signaling path-
way”, and “neutrophil degranulation” (Supplementary Data 2).
Thus, both at the whole transcriptome level and when
comparing microglia-specific factors and biological pathways,
oMG are very similar to adult MG.
To investigate a potential developmental effect on gene
expression between day 38 and day 52 oMG, differentially and
commonly expressed genes and pathways were assessed. The
transcriptomes of day 38 and day 52 oMG were most similar with
2160 differentially expressed genes (Supplementary Fig. 4k, FDR
< 0.05). Due to this lower number, no significantly enriched
pathways were detected when comparing day 38 and day 52
oMG. Several development-related terms were shared between
day 38 and day 52 oMG, such as “nervous system development”,
“neutrophil degranulation”, “cell adhesion”, and “receptor inter-
nalization” (Supplementary Data 2). The top 100 significantly
enriched genes in day 38 and day 52 oMG are depicted in
Supplementary Data 1.
oMG functionally resemble adult microglia. For further char-
acterization of oMG, single-cell suspensions were prepared from
organoids at day 52 and compared to adult MG. The classical
microglia cell surface markers CD45, CD11c, CD14, HLA-DR,
CX3CR1, CD206 were all present in oMG and displayed an
expression profile similar to that found in adult MG 1, as mea-
sured by flow cytometry (Fig. 4a).
For cell culture purposes, oMG were enriched using CD11b-
coated beads and magnetic cell sorting (MACS) on whole
organoid cell suspensions. MACS-sorted oMG and adult MG
were cultured for > 7 days, and displayed a highly similar
morphology (Fig. 4b). To assess if oMG and adult MG responded
similar to inflammatory triggers, E. Coli-derived lipopolysacchar-
ide (LPS; pro-inflammatory) and dexamethasone (anti-inflam-
matory) were added to the culture medium 24 h after plating the
cells. Their immune response was evaluated by qRT-PCR after
stimulation with LPS and dexamethasone for 6 and 72 h,
respectively. Similar to adult MG, mRNA expression of IL6 and
IL1B was significantly increased in oMG (day 52) after exposure
to LPS (Fig. 4c). This inflammatory response of oMG was
significantly increased compared to adult MG (IL6 and IL1B:
U = 0, n = 4, p < 0.05). Treatment with dexamethasone induced the
expected increase in mRNA expression of CD163 and MRC1 with a
similar increase in fold change in oMG and adult MG (Fig. 4d). To
test phagocytic capacity, we exposed oMG day 79 and adult MG to
iC3b-coated beads for 0.5 and 1 h. Beads were detected in adult MG
and oMG and as expected the number of phagocytosed beads
increased in time (Fig. 4e, f). This suggests that phagocytosis
regulated via the C3 receptor is functional in oMG.
Thus, oMG and adult MG display functional inflammatory and
phagocytic responses, in line with the similarity in their
transcriptomes.
oMG surround neurons and elicit immune response in orga-
noids. Microglia mediate inflammatory responses in the CNS, but
are also known to directly affect neurons, and vice versa, in the
developing human as well as rodent CNS4,6,28,29. Recently, it has
been established that microglia can initiate synaptogenesis, but
also eliminate synapses during development and in disease5,8,29.
Here, we began to probe the applicability of cerebral organoids
for studying the interplay between human microglia and neurons,
and for studying microglia-mediated inflammatory responses
in situ.
Immunohistochemistry for IBA-1 and TUJ1 followed by
epifluorescent microscopy showed that although during early
development (day 31) oMG were still in an amoeboid state these
cells were already located in close proximity to neurites (TUJ1)
(Fig. 5a). Upon further ramification, these oMG and their
processes became more intertwined with neuronal processes (day
52, Fig. 5a). As microglia have been reported to regulate synaptic
morphology and function we tested whether functional synapses
are present in the organoids. Indeed, postsynaptic responses to
presynaptic release of glutamate were detected at day 52 as
evidenced
by
spontaneous
excitatory
postsynaptic
currents
(sEPSCs) (Supplementary Fig. 1q). Further, voltage-dependent
sodium channels were present as inward currents were registered
in
response
to
evoked
increases
in
membrane
potential
(Supplementary Fig. 1r, s). These data suggest that cerebral
organoids contain functional synapses and could be used for
studying the potential effect of microglia on synapse function. But
can oMG processes be found in close proximity to neuronal
synaptic structures? To address this question, we applied super-
resolution stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy to
study the distribution of microglia (IBA-1) in relation to the
postsynaptic
marker PSD-95 in cerebral organoids. High-
resolution images from the STED experiment showed significant
overlap between IBA-1 and PSD-95 signals, with PSD-95 material
either inside IBA-1+ oMG processes or being in contact with or
partially engulfed by oMG ramifications (Fig. 5b).
To further probe the potential use of the oMG-organoid model,
we
assessed
whether
or
not
the
organoids
responded
to
inflammatory compounds in situ by exposing complete organoids
to LPS at day 52. We found that an acute cytokine response can be
assessed 24 h after LPS stimulation (Fig. 5c). Release of IL6, TNF-α,
but not IL10, was significantly increased after 24 h (IL6 and TNF-α:
W = 21, p = 0.03) and 72 h (IL6 and TNF-α: W = 21, p = 0.03) of
LPS stimulation, as measured by enzyme-linked immune assays

 (ELISA) indicating an acute and long-term effect (Fig. 5d).
Increased mRNA levels of IL6 and TNF, but not of IL10, were
detected after 72 h of LPS stimulation (IL6: W = 21, p = 0.03; TNF-
α: W = 19, p = 0.06) (Fig. 5d). The cytokine response to LPS
detected in the medium was low as compared to assays performed
with isolated oMG. However, this is expected considering that only
~1% of all cells of an organoid are microglia (~10.000 cells) and that
100.000 cells were used in the 2D experiments.
Overall, these data support the idea that the organoid model
described in this study represents a valuable tool to facilitate
research into the interaction of different cell types in the human
brain and the role of microglia during human CNS inflammation.

 Discussion
The current consensus is that cerebral organoids mainly consist
of differentiated cells from the neuroectodermal lineage. This is a
commonly mentioned drawback of this otherwise innovative
model as cells derived from other lineages, such as microglia, play
a
crucial
role
in
brain
development,
physiology,
and
pathology11,14. Our data refutes this assumption, as we show that
microglia can innately develop within cerebral organoids. Single-
cell RNAseq analyses of cerebral organoids by Quadrato et al.18
did show the presence of mesodermal progenitors in cerebral
organoids, but these did not display signs of microglial differ-
entiation. In our study, instead of adding extra BDNF to the
differentiation cocktail, like Quadrato et al., we reduced levels of
the neuroectoderm stimulant heparin and delayed matrigel
embedment of the organoids. Although we also detected oMG
following the original protocol of Lancaster et al.17, we found that
this adaptation improved the yield of microglia. These oMG
display a characteristic ramified morphology, express microglia-
specific markers, mediate inflammatory responses, and have
phagocytotic capacity.
The development of in vitro models to study human microglia
has been a major challenge in the field. Primary microglia can be
isolated from fresh human brain tissue30,31 and microglia can be
derived from iPSCs24,32,33, but both methods have their own
specific limitations. For example, acutely isolated microglia from
post mortem brain or surgery tissue yields a limited number of
cells. Another confounding factor is the quality of the post
mortem tissue, and phenotypic changes induced by 2D in vitro
culture26.
Several

partly
circumvent
these limitations. However, although these studies represent great
advances in the field, they still do not provide for the 3D inter-
action of microglia throughout brain development with neurons
and astrocytes in a human physiological setting. To generate
microglia from iPSCs, protein cocktails are used that are known
to drive microglia development in rodents, such as CSF1, IL34,
and TGFβ11,2,34. Interestingly, these factors are innately expres-
sed by cerebral organoids as shown in the present study. It is
thought that these previously identified factors act in concert with
other yet undefined factors secreted or expressed by neurons and
astrocytes to induce microglia differentiation and regulate
microglia phenotype. This idea is supported by a recent paper
describing that co-culture of iPSC-derived microglia with neurons
changes the phenotype of microglia into a more homeostatic
one35. Therefore, although every method to isolate or generate
human microglia will have its own limitations, the advantage of
oMG may be that these cells develop simultaneously with other
cell types that provide for essential molecular factors in a 3D
brain environment.
To validate the microglia identity of oMG, cells were pheno-
typically and functionally characterized and compared to adult
MG. At a cellular level, oMG resembled adult MG in several ways.
For example, when comparing the expression levels of extra-
cellular surface markers, the response of oMG and adult MG to
inflammatory stimuli, and the phagocytic response to iC3b-
coated-particles. Functional synapses were detected in the orga-
noids and microscopy-based approaches detected microglial
ramifications in close proximity to neuronal processes and
synaptic material. Different mechanisms of synaptic pruning have
been described, including synaptic stripping, phagocytosis, and
trogocytosis29,36. Our super-resolution microscopy data detected
postsynaptic material inside and in close proximity to oMG,
suggesting these different mechanisms may be at play as has been
reported for MG. Future studies are needed to dissect these
mechanisms for oMG in cerebral organoids, but our data further
identify the organoid model as a valuable tool for studying human
microglia-neuron interactions in 3D brain tissue.
At the transcriptome level, comparison between oMG and
adult MG1, showed that oMG expressed key microglia markers
(e.g., SPI1, AIF1, CSF1R, TLR4) at similar levels to MG found in
human post mortem samples. Some key genes like P2RY12,
TREM2, and TMEM119 that were lowly expressed in oMG cul-
tured for 52 days compared to adult MG, increased when oMG
were held in culture longer (119 days). Whole transcriptome
comparison with other datasets, including adult MG from this
study, and previously published datasets of adult MG, fetal MG
and iPSC MG, consistently validated the microglial identity of
oMG. Our data replicated the finding of Muffat et al. that iPSC
MG cluster with fetal MG rather than adult MG24. When com-
paring a selection of transcription factors that are important for
microglia in vivo26, adult MG had the lowest correlation with
fetal MG, which could reflect a maturation effect. Simultaneously,
oMG strongly correlated with adult MG, whereas fetal MG cor-
related with iPSC MG. Still, comparisons between multiple
available datasets, including the ones in this study, have inherent
limitations due to differences in sample processing of the different
resources. Nevertheless, it is tempting to speculate that the
mature phenotype of oMG may result from their interaction with
other cell types in 3D, interactions during differentiation not
present in recently published iPSC MG studies.
Our finding that microglia are present in cerebral organoids
provides novel opportunities for studying the human brain. First,
this model can be used to study the development of human
microglia in association with other developing human brain cells.
Gene editing of the iPSCs can be used to study the role of specific
factors that mediate the interaction between neurons and glia.
Second, this model will be useful to investigate how microglia are
involved in the development of human neurons and astrocytes,

determined by qRT-PCR and normalized to the geomean of the reference genes SDHA2 and ACTB. Two batches of cerebral organoids from iPSC 1, 3, and 5
were used (n = 6). IL10 levels were below detection level for the second batch of organoids. (*p < 0.05)

 including processes such as neurogenesis, synaptogenesis, and
synaptic pruning3–5. Third, this human cell model can be used to
study the pathogenesis of brain infections by viruses such as Zika
virus and HIV-1. Microglia are considered to be an important
target for these viruses and their immune reaction is likely to play
a role in the brain pathology caused by these pathogens37. Fourth,
this model can be used to understand the role of microglia,
macroglia and neurons in neurodevelopmental diseases, espe-
cially diseases with a clear genetic component, such as autism and
schizophrenia. Fifth, it opens new avenues to study diseases such
as Alzheimer’s disease and ALS in which a role for microglia and
their interaction with astrocytes and neurons is increasingly
recognized7.
Although the organoid model presented here is the first
method to develop iPSC-derived human microglia in a 3D neu-
ronal niche, it has a number of limitations17. An important
limitation is the fact that organoids are still far from representing
the human brain as they, for example, lack vasculature and cross-
talk with other tissues in the developing embryo17. Another
limitation is that the heterogeneity of cell types in cerebral
organoids, due to the absence of SMAD inhibition, co-occurs
with an increase in organoid-to-organoid variability. Although
microglia where detected in all organoids generated in our study,
their distribution was variable. A promising application to limit
variability instigated by the use of multiple iPSC donors is the use
of isogenic controls to study the role of specific proteins or
genetic risk variants on microglia development, phenotype and
function. In addition, although it is important to study microglia
in the 3D context, there are inherent technical challenges as
compared to studying these cells in 2D cultures. Fortunately,
many tools have been developed in the past decade to study
specific cell types in complete tissue, such as tissue clearing38,
cell-type
specific
expression
of
fluorescent
reporters,
and
advanced microscopic techniques, including light sheet, super-
resolution, and live-cell imaging29. Similar approaches can be
employed to study microglia in the organoid in situ, but these will
need further optimization.
In conclusion, here we report a method to develop iPSC-
derived microglia in a 3D neuronal niche. The potential to study
neuron/microglia interactions within human brain tissue will
significantly further our knowledge of the structural, functional,
and molecular mechanisms underlying microglia (dys)function in
the intact and diseased human brain.
Methods
Human subjects. The Medical Ethical Committee of the University Medical
Center Utrecht granted approval for iPSC line generation. Subjects gave written
informed consent. Fresh post mortem brain samples were provided by The
Netherlands Brain Bank (www.brainbank.nl, Table 1). The autopsy was performed
with signed informed consent (Table 1). Controls were individuals without diag-
nosis of a psychiatric or neurologic disorder.
iPSC generation and characterization. Whereas iPSC-line 1 and iPSC-line 3 have
previously been described19, iPSC-lines 4, 5, and 6 were similarly generated but
have not yet been published. Briefly, skin fibroblasts were transfected with a len-
tiviral vector expressing C-MYC/SOX2/NANOG/KLF4 and seeded on mouse
embryonic fibroblasts in hESC20 medium containing DMEM-F12 (ThermoFisher,
11320-074), 20% KOSR (ThermoFisher, 10828028), 1% NEAA (ThermoFisher,
11140-035), 1% L-Glutamine (ThermoFisher, 25030-024), 0.5% P/S (ThermoFisher,
15140-122), 496 μM ß-mercaptoethanol (Merck-Schuchardt, 805740), 20 ng/mL
bFGF (ThermoFisher, AA10-155). Clones were characterized by immunocy-
tochemistry with StemLight kit (Cell Signalling, 9656S) and quantitative reverse
transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) for stem cell markers (relative to hUES6 line,
Harvard University, RRID:CVCL_B194). Cells were karyotyped by G-band stain-
ing. Pluripotency was evaluated by embryoid body formation followed by 5 weeks
of spontaneous differentiation in minimal medium DMEM-GlutaMax (Thermo-
Fisher, 31966-021), 10% FBS (Sigma, F7524) and stained for markers of the three
germ layers.
iPSC culture. Lines were maintained at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in feeder free condi-
tions. Cells were cultured on Geltrex-coated (Thermofisher, A1413202) dishes in
mTeSR1 medium (Stem cell Technologies, 85850), weekly passaged with Accutase
(Thermofisher, A11105-01) and seeded in mTeSR1 supplemented with ROCK-
inhibitor Y-27632 (4.82 μM, Axon 1683). All lines were kept in culture up to 60
passages and frequently tested for mycoplasma infection (Lonza, LT07-318).
Organoid differentiation. Organoids were differentiated using a modified version
of a previously published protocol (Supplementary Table 1)12. In short, after dis-
sociation into single-cell suspension with Accutase, 3.5 × 106 cells were seeded per
well in an Aggrewell800 microwell plate (StemCell Technologies, 27865) in 2 mL of
hESC4 (4 ng/mL bFGF) medium supplemented with ROCK-inhibitor Y-27632
(48.2 μM). Approximately 11,500 cells per microwell were left to form embryoid
bodies overnight. After 48 h, embryoid bodies (EB; 325 + /- 40 μm) were trans-
ferred to ultra-low attachment 96-well plates (Corning, 3474). Medium was
replaced at day 4 by hESC0 (hESC without bFGF) and at day 6 by neural induction
medium (NIM). At day 13, organoids (570 + /- 50 μm) were embedded in matrigel
(Corning, 356234) and kept in organoid differentiation medium without retinoic
acid (RA). Four days later they were transferred to spinning bioreactors on a
magnetic platform (27.5 rpm; Pfeiffer, 183-001). No changes were made in the
composition of the medium compared to the original protocol with exception of
Heparin in the NIM where we used 0.1 μg/mL instead of 1 μg/mL. All organoid
cultures were qualitatively selected according to the guidelines described pre-
viously17. Seven batches were made from iPSC 1, and three batches of iPSC 3 and 5
(Table 1). Each batch had a minimum of 32 organoids.
Single-cell preparation from organoids. Five organoids per 60 mm dish were
washed three times with DPBS (ThermoFisher, 14190094) and immersed in 6 mL
of papain (18.6 U/mL, Worthington, LK003176) and DNAse 1 (337 U/mL Wor-
thington, LK003170) in DMEM/F12. Mechanical dissociation using scalpels was
followed by a 30 min incubation at 37 °C on a shaker. In all, 2% FBS was added to
stop the enzymatic reaction and the resulting single-cell suspension was centrifuged
followed by an additional incubation with DNAse 1 (337 U/mL, Roche Diagnostics,
11284932001) in MACs buffer (PBS pH 7.4 (Gibco Life technologies, MA)), 2 mM
EDTA (Sigma-Aldrich, The Netherlands) and 1% FBS) at room temperature for
15 min.
Single-cell preparation from post mortem brain tissue. Dissociation of fresh
post mortem brain tissue started within 2 to 24 h after autopsy according to the
protocol described before with a minor modification30,39. In short, single-cell
suspension was achieved by mechanical dissociation followed by enzymatic
digestion using either 200 μg/mL DNAse 1 (Roche Diagnostics, 11284932001) and
3700 U/mL collagenase type 1 (Worthington, LS004196) for the medial frontal
gyrus, superior temporal gyrus and thalamus, or DNAse 130,40 and Trypsin for the
subventricular zone39. The protocol was slightly adjusted by adding an extra
DNAse 1 incubation at room temperature (RT) for 15 min after the first enzymatic
digestion to improve the single cellularity before FACS-sorting.
Fluorescence-activated cell sorting for RNAseq. The single-cell suspension was
incubated with an FC receptor blocking reagent (Miltenyi Biotec, 5170126102)
(1:20), anti-CD11b (eBioscience, 12-0118-41) (1:80) and anti-CD45 (eBioscience,
11-9459) antibodies (1:20) at 4 °C for 15 min. Cells were washed twice and sus-
pended in glucose-potassium-sodium buffer (GKN-BSA; 8 g/L NaCl, 0.4 g/L KCl,
1.77 g/L Na2HPO4.2H2O, 0.69 g/L NaH2- PO4.H2O, 6 g/L D-(1)-glucose, pH 7.4)
with 0.3% BSA. 7-AAD (BD Biosciences, 5168981E) (1 μg/mL) was added for cell
death detection. Cells were poured over a 70 μm cell strainer before sorting. Cells
were sorted/gated that were alive, single, and CD11b+/CD45+ with the FACSAria
III (Supplementary Fig. 5a). The sorted CD11b+/CD45+ fraction was placed on ice,
centrifuged at 400 rcf for 5 min, lysed in Trizol reagent (Life Technologies,
15596018). The mean percentage of CD11b+/CD45+ cells of iPSC donors 1, 3, and
5 was 0.83% ± 0.3 at both timepoints for oMG (Supplementary Fig. 2c). RNA was
isolated with the miRNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, 217004) according to the manu-
facturer's protocol including DNAse 1. Isolated RNA was eluded in 40 μL RNAse
free water and concentration determined using VarioSkan Flash microplate reader
(Thermo Scientific, MA).
RNA sequencing. Quality control of RNA samples, library preparation and
sequencing of the oMG and adult MG1 samples was performed by the Service XS
sequencing facility (Genome Analysis Facility, Leiden, The Netherlands). Single-
end polyA enriched (adult MG1, oMG day 38 and oMG day 52) and paired-end
rRNA depleted (fibroblasts, iPSCs) libraries were sequenced on the Illumina
NextSeq 500 sequencer and on the Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform (Illumina, San
Diego, California), respectively. Reads were de-multiplexed and converted to
FASTQ files using bcl2fastq (version 2.17; adult MG1, oMG day 38, oMG day 52)
or CASAVA (fibroblasts, iPSC) software from Illumina. FASTQ files were mapped
to the hg19/GCh37 reference human genome (iGenomes). For adult MG1, oMG
day 38 and oMG day 52 Bowtie2 (version 2.1.0) and TopHat2 (version 2.0.14)
software was used for read alignment. TopHat2 (version 2.0.13) was used for
alignment of fibroblast and iPSC reads. Read counts per transcript were determined

 using HTSeq software (version 0.6.1). RPKM/FPKM (reads/fragments per kilobase
of exon per million reads mapped) values were calculated from raw read counts
using library size and transcript lengths.
Differential expression and gene ontology analyses. Read counts per transcript
for adult MG1 (n = 3), oMG day 38 (n = 3), oMG day 52 (n = 3), fibroblasts (n =
3), and iPSC samples (n = 4) were analyzed within the R environment (version
3.4.3) using DESeq2 (version 1.18.1). After normalization using DESeq2 default
settings that correct for library size, differential gene expression was calculated
between samples to identify common genes among samples (False discovery rate
(FDR) > 0.05, sum of raw read counts > 0). Differential gene expression between
oMG day 52 and adult MG1, and oMG day 52 and oMG day 38 was calculated by
performing a pair-wise comparison using DESeq2. The analysis was corrected for
sex. Significantly differentially expressed genes (FDR < 0.05) and common genes
(FDR > 0.05, sum of raw read counts > 0) were identified for each comparison.
Shrinkage of log2Fold changes was applied using the apeglm algorithm in DESeq2.
To determine microglia-specific common and differentially expressed genes
between oMG day 52 and oMG day 38, and oMG day 52 and adult MG1 the
common genes between microglia, fibroblasts and iPSC were removed. Gene
ontology analysis was performed to determine overrepresentation of the different
gene sets in GO cluster biological functions (BP), using the topGO R package
(version 2.30.1, Gene Ontology Consortium. Gene Ontology Consortium: going
forward. Nucleic Acids Res. 2015; 43: D1049–56. doi: 10.1093/nar/gku1179). Fisher
statistical test was performed to test for overrepresentation, with a weighted
algorithm to correct for dependency between parent–child relations between gene
ontology clusters. The test was performed in the context of all Ensembl IDs con-
sidered in the differential gene expression analysis. Annotation build of 12-July-
2018 (org.Hs.eg.db, ID = ensemble) was used for the annotation. p-values were
adjusted for multiple comparisons using the Bonferonni correction. Principal
component analysis, scaling of expression values and unsupervised hierarchical
cluster analysis were performed in R (version 3.4.3) and plots were generated using
the ggplot2 package (version 3.0.0). For spearman correlation analysis, the Harrell
Miscellaneous (Hmisc, version 4.1-1) package was used and plots were generated
using the corrplot package (version 0.84) in R.
Gene expression analysis with real-time PCR. RNA was isolated and cDNA
prepared as described before30. Primers were intron-spanning and designed with
PrimerBLAST (NCBI). Absolute levels of expression were determined (2ΔCT) and
normalized with the geomean of two reference genes ACTB and SDHA2 (see
primer sequences in Supplementary Table 3). Two organoids were pooled per
timepoint for RNA isolation.
Magnetic cell sorting (MACs) of oMG and adult MG1. The CD11b+ fraction of
organoids was enriched by MACs according to manufacturer’s protocol (Miltenyi,
130049601). In short, single cells were incubated with the beads in MACS buffer
and sorted using magnetic columns. The CD11b+ cells were collected in microglia
culture medium (RPMI 1640 (Life technologies, 21875034), 10% FBS, 2 mM L-
glutamine, 100 U/mL penicillin, 100 μg/mL streptomycin (BioWhittaker, Belgium),
and 100 ng/mL recombinant IL34 (Miltenyi, 130105780)). Eight organoids were
used per digestion to obtain sufficient yield for experiments at day 52, 74, and 119.
On average (n = 9) the CD11b+ cells constituted 5% + /- 2.8 of the entire single-
cell suspension. Sorting efficiency was confirmed by assessing the expression of
specific microglia- and non-microglia-related genes in three batches of oMG 1 and
adult MG1 (Supplementary Fig. 3b). We detected OLIG2 in the microglia-enriched
fraction indicating the presence of a low percentage of oligodendrocytes that are
known to express low levels of CD11b. The CD11b+ MACs enriched oMG or pMG
cells were plated 1*105 cells per well in a 96-well flat-bottom plate or 2*105 on a
glass coverslip in a 24-well flat-bottom plate and cultured in microglia-culture
medium at 37 °C in 5% CO2,
Pro- and anti-inflammatory stimulation. After one day in culture, adult MG and
oMG were exposed to 100 ng/mL lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from Escherichia coli
(Sigma-Aldrich, 0111:B4) or 1 μM dexamethasone (Sigma-Aldrich, D4902-25) for
6 h or 72 h, respectively (n = 4). Cells were lysed in 500 μL Trizol reagent.
Preparation of iC3b-coated beads. Human iC3b (Merck Millipore, 204863)
protein was coated on FluoSphere® (ThermoFisher, F8827) Carboxylate-Modified
Microspheres (2.0 μm, yellow-green fluorescent (505/515), 2% solids). Twenty-five
microliters of bead suspension was washed twice by centrifugation (400 rcf, 10
min) in MES buffer (0.488 g MES hydrate (CAS # 4432-31-9 (anhydrous), Sigma-
Aldrich, Missouri) in 50 mL MQ (50 mM), pH 6.0). 50 μL iC3b (50 μg protein), or
50 μL MES buffer (for the negative control) was added to the beads and incubated
on a shaker at RT for 15 min. In all, 20 μL 10 g/L freshly prepared EDAC buffer
(Thermofisher Scientific, MA) was added to the mixture for 2 h on a shaker at RT.
The reaction was quenched with 100 mM glycine (100590, Merck Millipore,
Germany) at RT for 30 min. Beads were washed three times in PBS by cen-
trifugation (14,000 rpm, 10 min), suspended in 100 μL PBS and stored at 4 °C. The
concentration was measured with a photospectrometer (BioPhotometer,
Eppendorf, Germany). Coating was confirmed by comparing phagocytosis of non-
coated and coated beads.
Phagocytosis assay. After one week, cells, cultured on coverslips in a 24-well
plate, were incubated with iC3b-coated beads at a concentration of 3 beads per cell
at 37 °C for 0.5 or 1 h. Cells were washed three times with cold PBS, fixed with 4%
PFA for 10 min at RT, and immunostained for IBA-1. Imaging was performed with
an Olympus (Tokyo, Japan) Fluoview FV1000 confocal microscope or with a Zeiss
Axio- Scope A1. Bead engulfment by adult MG and oMG was analyzed on three
randomly selected view fields per section and per condition (oMG1, for 0.5 and 1 h;
adult MG1.7, 1.8, and 1.9, for 0.5 and 1 h). IBA-1+ cells were categorized based on
the number of inoculated beads as follows: 0 (type 1), 1–5 (type 2), 6–15 (type 3),
or > 15 (type 4) using FIJI version 1.49 software.
Organoid fixation and immunohistochemistry. Organoids were fixed in 4% PFA
at 4 °C for 10 min, washed in PBS and transferred to 30% sucrose solution over-
night at 4 °C. Samples were embedded in tissue-tek (CellPath, KMA0100-00A)
snap-frozen on dry ice and stored at –80 °C. Twenty micrometersections were
obtained with a cryostat.
Sections were blocked for 1 h in blocking solution (1% Triton-X, 3% BSA and
10% donkey or goat serum) at RT followed by incubation with primary antibodies
in blocking solution overnight at 4 °C. Sections were then washed with PBS and
incubated with secondary antibodies and Hoechst (ThermoFisher, H3569) at RT
for 2 h. When Hoechst staining was not performed, samples were incubated with
DAPI for 5 min before mounting. See Supplementary Table 4 for antibodies used in
this study. Samples were mounted on glass coverslips using Fluorosave
(CalBioChem, 345789) and imaged (Olympus (Tokyo, Japan) Fluoview FV1000
confocal microscope or Zeiss Axio- Scope A1). In all, ≥ 3 organoids from three
batches were sectioned and imaged.
Super-resolution STED microscopy. Dual-color gated STED (gSTED) imaging of
day 66 organoids immunostained for IBA-1 and PSD-95 was performed with a
Leica TCS SP8 STED 3X microscope using a HC PL APO 100 × / 1.4 oil immersion
STED WHITE objective. The 590 and 647 nm wavelengths of pulsed white laser
(80 MHz) were used to excite the Alexa594-labeled PSD-95 and the Atto647N-
labeled IBA-1, respectively. Both Alexa594 and Atto647N were depleted with the
775 nm pulsed depletion laser (10%–20% of maximum power) and we used an
internal Leica HyD hybrid detector (set at 100% gain) with a time gate of 0.3 ≤ tg ≤
6 ns. Multiple Z-stack were obtained at 0.18 µm interval to acquire 4.0 µm image
stacks (corrected for refractive index mismatch between oil immersion objective
and FluorSave, the mounting medium used) in 2D STED mode using the 100x
objective with ~2x zoom to obtain approximately 80 nm pixel size. Raw gSTED
images collected using Leica TCS SP8 were subjected to deconvolution as stacks
using Huygens deconvolution software. Deconvolution of the 594 and 647 channels
was performed separately using the CMLE deconvolution algorithm, with a max-
imum of 40 iterations and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) set at 7.
Quantification of immunohistochemistry. Microglia perimeter was quantified
using a macro in FIJI software on sections of four separate organoids per timepoint.
The macro consisted of the following steps: transformation to 8-bit; scale set to μm;
automated default threshold applied; converted to mask (particles filtered with size
> 40 μm; option “outline”; the outline area was summarized and averaged over total
number of microglia in the image to obtain the perimeter/microglia cell (Fig. 1f).
To determine the fraction of TUJ1 and IBA-1 staining in organoid sections, two
tiled scans per organoid of three batches from oMG1 were prepared. A macro in
FIJI was created with the following steps: background subtraction (rollingbal set to
10 (hoechst) or 78 (TUJ1, IBA-1) pixels; contrast was automatically enhanced;
automated default threshold applied; particles were quantified with size of > 5
(hoechst) or > 10 (TUJ1, IBA-1) pixels; positive area was summarized; TUJ1 and
IBA-1 was normalized by dividing the positive area by the hoechst positive nuclear
area (Supplementary Fig. 2a, b, d).
Pro-inflammatory stimulation cerebral organoids. Organoids were singled in a
24-well flat-bottom plate. After 24 and 48 h, LPS (100 ng/mL) was added to the
medium. A pilot experiment to determine the optimal timing for cytokine mea-
surements, showed that 24 h after LPS stimulation the cytokine response was
significantly increased as determined with a Friedman’s ANOVA test (p = 0.03;
Dunn’s test t = 6 versus baseline: -3 with p = 0.44; Dunn’s test t = 24 vs. baseline:
-6 with p = 0.03) (Fig. 5c). Therefore, we used 24 h to measure the acute response,
and 72 h for the effect on the long-term. Medium was collected after 24 h and 72 h
for ELISA. Organoids were lysed in Trizol. Two batches of organoids from oMG 1,
3, and 5 were used for this experiment.
Cytokine secretion. Anti-human IL6, TNF-α, and IL10 ELISA Ready-Set-Go® kits
(eBioscience, 88706688, 88734688 and 88734688, respectively) were used according
to manufacturer’s protocol. Samples were analyzed in a Varioskan™ Flash (Ther-
moFisher Scientific, MA) with an optical density (OD) of 450 nm. Blank

 subtraction was performed and the value of the samples was based on the standard
curve.
Primer panels for microglia characterization. A panel of microglia markers was
selected based on literature34,41,21–23 (Supplementary Table 3). In addition, general
markers for astrocytes, neurons, and oligodendrocytes were selected to determine
enrichment of the microglia population after CD11b+ sorting.
Protein expression analysis. In all, 8*105 single cells from fresh human brain
material and cerebral organoids were stained in a 96-well V-bottom plate using the
following antibodies from Ebioscience (San Diego, CA): CD45 (#119459), CD11b
(#12011841), CD14 (clone 61D3, #90170149025), CD11c (clone 3.9, #11011641),
HLA-DR (clone LN3, #17995641), CX3CR1 (clone eB149/10H5, #17609941), IgG1
(#114714 and #17471441), IgG2b (#17403181); antibodies from BD Bioscience:
CD206 (#561763); antibodies from BioLegend IgG2b (#400319). Protein expression
was quantified on a FACSCanto II (BD Biosciences) and analyzed with FACSDiva
software (Version 8.0.1, BD Biosciences). Protein expression was measured in cells
that were gated to be alive, single, and CD11b+ (Supplementary Fig. 5b). The
geoMFI mean was subtracted from the geoMFI of the corresponding isotype
control.
Electrophysiology. Organoids were cut in two and continuously perfused with
artificial cerebrospinal fluid at 32 °C ± 1, containing 120 mM NaCl, 3.5 mM KCl,
1.3 mM MgSO4, 1.25 mM NaH2PO4, 2.5 mM CaCl2, 10 mM D-glucose, and
25 mM NaHCO3, and 5% CO2, pH 7.4. Patch pipettes for recording were pro-
duced from borosilicate glass (1.5 mm outer diameter, 0.86 mm inner diameter;
Harvard Apparatus Limited, Holliston, Massachusetts, USA; pipette resistance
~4–5 MΩ) on a P-97 Flaming/Brown micropipette puller (Sutter Instruments,
USA) and filled with pipette solution containing (in mM): 120 Cs methane
sulfonate, 17.5 CsCl, 10 Hepes, 2 MgATP, 0.1 NaGTP, 5 BAPTA; pH was 7.4,
adjusted with CsOH. Whole cell voltage clamp recordings were performed using
an Axopatch 200B (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, California, USA) amplifier.
Responses were filtered at 5 kHz and digitized at 10 kHz using Digidata 1322 A
(Axon Instruments, USA). Data was analyzed using pClamp 9.0 and Clampfit 9.2
(Axon Instruments). Recordings with a series resistance of less than 2.5 times the
pipette resistance were accepted for analysis. The holding potential for sponta-
neous excitatory postsynaptic currents was kept at –65 mV. The voltage-
dependent sodium currents were activated with depolarizing voltage steps with
duration of 100 ms starting from –60 mV with increments of 10 mV to + 40 mV
(Supplementary Fig. S2E). Series resistance was compensated for approximately
70%. Due to the very small voltage-dependent potassium and calcium currents,
it was not necessary to block these currents.
Statistics. Statistical comparisons were performed with Friedman’s ANOVA, two-
tailed Mann–Whitney (non-paired data) and Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank
(paired data) tests by using GraphPad Prism software version 6 (Graphpad Soft-
ware, CA), as normality assumptions were not met. R version 3.0.2 software
(CRAN:https://www.r-project.org) was used for RNA sequencing data analysis.
Immunofluorescent images were analyzed and quantified by using FIJI version
1.49 software (NIH, Bethesda, MD). A significance level of p < 0.05 was used.
