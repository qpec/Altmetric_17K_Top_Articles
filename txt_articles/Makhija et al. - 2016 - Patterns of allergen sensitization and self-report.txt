Introduction
Similar to other allergic diseases, the prevalence of food allergy has been increasing for the 
last several decades.1,2 While the cause for this increase in food allergy has not yet been 
elucidated, an interaction between genetic and environmental factors including the timing 
and route of allergen exposure has been implicated.3-7 Sensitization, or presence of allergic 
antibody, is a prerequisite for development of an allergic response to an allergen. Patterns of 
sensitization to environmental and food allergens have previously been studied in children in 
an effort to better understand allergy development. Notably, differences in biologic sex have 
been observed with a higher prevalence of sensitization in boys though this finding has not 
been shown to be consistent in all age ranges.8,9

 Previous studies have assessed patterns of allergen sensitization in adults and differences in 
biologic sex among families. In the United States, the prevalence of allergen sensitization in 
the adult population has previously been estimated using the National Health and Nutrition 
Examination Survey (NHANES). NHANES 2005-2006 measured serum specific IgE (sIgE) 
concentrations to multiple food and environmental allergens. Subjects were tested to 15 
inhalant allergens and 4 food allergens (egg, milk, peanut and shrimp). Nearly half (44.6%) 
of those surveyed had sIgE to at least 1 of the 19 allergens tested, highlighting a high 
prevalence of allergen sensitization in the United States.9 High prevalence has been reported 
in other nations as well. A European multi-country survey of adults ages 20-54 found a high 
prevalence of sIgE to foods (range 6.6% to 23.6%).10 In this study, higher prevalence of 
sensitization was specifically noted to food allergens that are related to pollen allergens such 
as apple (6.5%), peach (7.9%) and hazel nut (9.3%).10
Our family-based population study of food-allergic children and their parents provided a 
unique opportunity to assess sensitization to foods and aeroallergens in an atopic population. 
Previously this cohort was used to investigate familial aggregation of food allergy. 
Significant positive associations between parents and offspring were observed for total IgE 
and sIgE to all the examined food allergens and aeroallergens. An estimated heritability for 
food-specific IgE ranged from 0.15 to 0.35 and for aeroallegens from 0.24 to 0.38.11 Our 
objective was to use this population of parents of food-allergic children to investigate 
patterns of food and aeroallergen sensitization and biologic sex differences in sensitization.
Methods
Study population and data collection
This study was part of a family-based food allergy study in Chicago, IL. Local families were 
recruited from both hospital clinics and the community setting from August 2005 through 
May 2008. Eligible families had 1 index child (0 to 21) with any food allergy and 2 or more 
family members (biological parents and/or siblings). Clinical criteria for food allergy in the 
child were met if positive tests (specific IgE or skin test to that food) corroborated typical 
symptoms of an allergic reaction to a food with onset within 2 hours of ingestion. A positive 
test or sensitization to a food was defined as either a positive ImmunoCAP or a positive skin 
prick test. Symptoms included any one of the following: skin (hives or angioedema); 
respiratory tract (difficulty breathing, shortness of breath, repetitive coughing, wheezing, or 
chest tightness); oropharyngeal (throat tightness, choking, or difficulty swallowing; tongue 
swelling); cardiovascular (fainting, dizziness, light-headedness, or decreased level of 
consciousness); or gastrointestinal (vomiting).12 (ref Kumar paper) Parents of children with 
chronic health conditions other than asthma, eczema, or allergic rhinitis in the index child 
were excluded. Information regarding home environment, history of atopic diseases and 
food allergy of each family member was collected via questionnaire-based self-report. Skin 
prick testing was performed. Venous blood samples were obtained from each participating 
family member. Allergen sensitization was defined as having sIgE > 0.35 kUA/L or a 
positive skin test. The Institutional Review Board (IRB) of the former Children's Memorial 
Hospital (now the Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago) approved the

 study. All participating adults and children over 12 years of age provided written informed 
consent or assent as per IRB guidelines prior to entry.
Total and specific IgE measurement
Total serum IgE, sIgE for 9 food allergens (egg white, sesame, peanut, soy, milk, shrimp, 
walnut, cod fish, and wheat) and for 6 perennial environmental allergens (cat dander, dog 
dander, cockroach, Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus, Dermatophagoides farinae and 
Alternaria alternata) were measured for each subject using Phadia ImmunoCAP. Total serum 
IgE was reported in a range from 2.0 to 5,000 kU/L. sIgE was reported as a value from 0.1 to 
100 kUA/L, with >0.35 kUA/L considered positive. All total and sIgE assays were 
performed by the Clinical Immunology Laboratory at Children's Memorial Hospital. Quality 
control and recalibration for the assays were performed as previously published.11 Allergen 
sensitization was defined as having sIgE > 0.35 kUA/L or a positive skin test.
Skin prick testing
Skin prick tests were performed on participants using the Multitest II device (Lincoln 
Diagnostics) to 9 food allergens (cow milk, soy, egg white, wheat, fish mix [cod, flounder, 
halibut, mackerel, tuna], shellfish mix [clam, crab, oyster, scallops, shrimp], peanut, sesame, 
and English walnut) and to 5 perennial environmental allergens (cat hair, dog epithelia, 
cockroach mix [American and German cockroach], house dust mite mix [equal parts mixture 
of D. farinae and D. pteronyssinus] and Alternaria alternata). Any skin test with a mean 
wheal diameter at least 3 mm greater than the saline control was considered positive. 
Histamine was used as a positive control.
Statistical Analysis
We compared the sensitization rates in our population of adults for 4 food allergens with 
publically available NHANES 2005-2006 sensitization data using one-sample binomial tests 
for the matching sex and age groups. Chi-square tests or Fisher's exact tests with a 
significance level of 0.05 were performed to compare the sensitization rates to each 
individual allergen between mothers and fathers. A pairwise analysis was also performed. 
Chi-square tests were used to compare parents who self-reported food allergy with those 
who did not self-report food allergy. Finally, we looked at the potential predictors of self-
report of food allergy in fathers and mothers by fitting two separate logistic regression 
models. All statistical analyses were performed using SAS 9.3 (SAS Institute, Cary NC), 
IBM SPSS Statistics, version 22 (SPSS Inc., Chicago IL) and GraphPad Prism version 6.03 
(GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA).
Results
Full data was available for 1252 mothers and 1225 fathers of food-allergic children. 
Demographic information for the population is provided in Table 1. 13.7% of all parents 
reported current food allergy with 3.6% reporting allergy to shellfish, 2.1% to milk, 2.1% to 
peanut, 2.1% to tree nuts, 1.4% to fish, 1.1% to egg, 1.0% to soy, 0.9% to wheat and 0.3% to 
sesame. Two-thirds of adults (66.1%) were sensitized to either a food or aeroallergen. Table 
2 shows the prevalence of allergen sensitization (positive skin prick test or sIgE >0.35) for

 mothers and fathers. 14.5% of mothers and 12.7% of fathers reported current food allergy. 
For mothers and fathers combined, the prevalence of sensitization to peanut (15.1%) and 
sesame (14.4%) were substantially higher than milk (4.4%), egg (3.3%) and fish (1.2%). In 
their children, the most prevalent allergen was peanut (37.3%) followed by milk (29%) and 
egg (22.1%).
Of the parents who self-reported food allergy, only 28.4 % had sensitization to the food 
allergen in question. The percentage of parents who reported a food allergy and who were 
sensitized to that food ranged from 10.7% for fish to 55.6% for peanut. We assessed the 
proportion of adults with sensitization (a positive skin test or sIgE >0.35) who reported food 
allergy to the food in question. For skin prick testing, this ranged from 11.8% for egg to 
33.3% to fish and for positive sIgE from 21.7% for egg to 72.7% for fish (eTable 1). For 
comparison purposes, the correlation between testing results and food allergy report in the 
child cohort is presented in eTable 2. Notably, the proportion of children meeting stringent 
or probable criteria for food allergy by history with sensitization to that food was higher for 
milk, egg, wheat, shrimp, peanut, and walnut.
Figure 1 shows the distribution of log transformed geometric mean food sIgE 
concentrations. The mean sIgEs were low. The lowest mean sensitization in mothers was to 
cod fish (0.65kUa/L) and the highest mean was to peanut (1.31 kUa/L,). In fathers, the 
lowest mean sensitization was to soy (0.73 kUa/L) and the highest mean was to shrimp (1.20 
kUa/L).
Standard chi-squared tests were performed to compare the prevalence of sensitization to 
each specific allergen between mothers and fathers in our cohort (Table 2). Pairwise analyses 
were also performed for each set of parents to control for possible household/environmental 
confounders. No significant differences were found between the pairwise analyses and the 
analysis reported in Table 2.
Environmental sensitization was common in this cohort. Sensitization to dust mites and cats 
had the highest prevalence. Mothers and fathers who self-reported food allergy had 
significantly higher reports of asthma and environmental allergies compared to those who 
did not self-report food allergy (p <0.01). These parents also had higher rates of sensitization 
to any food or environmental allergen (p < 0.01). Figure 2 shows prevalence rates of 
sensitization by food allergen in parents who self-reported food allergy as compared to 
parents whom did not self-report food allergy.
We next compared our food sensitization data to the NHANES 2005-2006 sensitization data 
available for 1154 males and females aged 30-39. The mean age in our cohort was 37.9 
years. For the 4 food allergens that were tested in both populations (peanut, shrimp, milk and 
egg), our cohort had a significantly higher prevalence of food sensitization (sIgE ≥0.35) to 
all four foods (Table 3).
Logistic regression analysis of predictors of self-reported food allergy to any food revealed a 
statistically significant positive association in fathers with self-report of asthma (OR = 1.73 
[CI 1.04-2.89], P=0.04), environmental allergy (OR 2.16 [CI 1.40-3.33] P=0.001) and 
eczema (OR 1.94 [1.20-3.14] P=0.01). For mothers, statistically significant positive

 associations between self-report of food allergy were found with self-report of 
environmental allergy (OR 3.23 [CI 2.17-4.79] P<0.0001) and having more than 1 child with 
food allergy (OR 1.54 [CI 1.09-2.18] P=0.01). Maternal self-report of asthma showed a 
trend towards significance (OR 1.51 (0.97-2.34) P=0.07) as did self-report of eczema (OR 
1.46 [CI 0.97-2.20] P=0.07). The other variables evaluated in the logistic regression were not 
significant and included age, race, ethnicity and education level. Prior history of asthma, 
eczema and food allergy were also not associated with increased self-report of food allergy 
in either mothers or fathers.
Discussion
It is well known that atopy has a strong hereditary component. 13,14 A population based 
survey of 3800 Finnish children and their biologic parents found a strong association 
between parental allergies and positive food allergy testing in their children with the 
incidence of positive testing being two-fold higher if any allergy was reported in either 
parent and threefold higher if allergic conditions were reported in both parents.14 In this 
cohort, we conversely assessed prevalence of allergy self-report and sensitization to foods 
and aeroallergens by skin prick and sIgE testing in parents of food-allergic children.
This paper examines sensitization in parents of food-allergic children from a unique 
perspective. Previous studies have focused solely on the general adult population and have 
not looked at sensitization in a selectively atopic cohort. 9,10 As one might expect, levels of 
sensitization in parents of food-allergic children are higher than in the general US 
population.9 However, even though there are statistically significant differences in specific 
allergen sensitizations between our study population and NHANES data, these actual 
differences are more modest than one might expect if food allergy is highly determined by 
genetics. There is also a high rate of self-reported food allergies, asthma, eczema and rhinitis 
in this cohort compared to the general population. 15-17 However, when we look closely at 
the levels of sIgE in parents who report allergy they are very low and clinical reactivity 
seems unlikely based upon pediatric studies of sIgE concentration and oral food challenge 
outcome.18,19 This certainly brings into question the reliabilty of self-report of allergy.
Adult data regarding correlation of sIgE and clinical outcomes are lacking. Less than 20% of 
parents who reported allergy to wheat, fish, egg or milk had positive skin testing or positive 
sIgE to the food in question. The highest correlation between report of food allergy and 
sensitization was to peanut, yet even in this group sensitization was noted for only 55.6 % of 
those reporting peanut allergy. This high rate of reported food allergy without sensitization 
may be considered surprising given the knowledge of IgE-mediated food allergy one would 
expect these families to have. We speculate that increased awareness of food allergy may 
actually result in increased reporting. Alternatively, it is possible that some adults were 
labeled as allergic when young and did not seek re-evaluation. Of parents who reported no 
food allergy, 14% had evidence of sensitization to peanut, 14 % to sesame, 10% to soy and 
10% to shellfish. As has been previously illustrated, self-report of food allergy and/or 
sensitization is not diagnostic of food allergy prevalence.20 Oral food challenges remain the 
gold standard to confirm or refute the diagnosis.

 The highest concordance between reported allergy and sensitization was noted for peanut, 
sesame and soy. High rates of sensitization to soy and peanut are consistent with other 
studies demonstrating high prevalence of sensitization to plant-related allergens.9,21-23 
Though cross reactivity with homologous pollen allergens likely plays a role in the high 
sensitization to peanut and soy allergens, we unfortunately do not have either specific pollen 
sensitization or protein component specific IgE data in our cohort to confirm or refute this. 
Though sesame has not been reported to have cross reactivity with pollens, two sesame 
allergens (Ses i 2 and Ses i 3) belong to the family of seed storage proteins and share 
homology with peanut and soybean allergens. 24 This may explain the high prevalence of 
sesame sensitization seen in this cohort. Sesame has also been noted in a European adult 
prevalence study to be the most common IgE sensitization in the class of “true” food 
allergens that do not cross react with pollen allergens, so our finding of higher sensitization 
to this allergen is not unique and may deserve further study. 10
Interestingly, differences were noted between mothers and fathers. While more mothers 
reported a physician diagnosis of food allergy (13.3% as compared to 8.9% of fathers), 
fathers had more sensitization to environmental allergens and more food sensitization to 
peanut, walnut, shellfish, wheat, soy and sesame (p<0.01). It is possible that the higher 
prevalence of atopic diseases among mothers reflects some selection bias rather than an 
actual higher prevalence as mothers with atopy may be more likely to enroll their children in 
such a study as this one. The relationship between biologic sex and food allergy throughout 
life has not been as well characterized as that in childhood. A PubMed database search 
looking at sex disparity in food allergy previously noted most reporting of food allergy in 
adults to be done by women (34.82% of men and 65.18% of women older than 18, a male to 
female ratio of 0.53).25 The authors noted an appearance of sex reversal in food allergies at 
puberty and an attenuation of sex differences near menopause suggesting a role for 
hormones in these differences.25 It is important to distinguish between biologic differences 
between males and females (sex) versus the social, cultural, and/or psychological traits 
typically associated with one sex (gender). Other authors have proposed that gender rather 
than biologic sex differences contribute to how individuals process information including in 
reporting of quality of life measures and in self-efficacy as related to food allergy. 26 Future 
studies of food allergy in the adult population, especially relying on self-report, should take 
the impact of gender on perception and reporting of symptoms into account.
The major limitations of this study include the use of self-report not only of food allergy but 
also of other atopic conditions. In addition the report of physician diagnosis carries its own 
issues unless appropriate testing including double blind food challenges have been 
performed. There is likely bias in our very high prevalence rates of atopy. It would have been 
advantageous to have objective evidence of food allergy (i.e. oral food challenge results) as 
it is well known that rates of self-report of food allergy (or perceived allergy) are higher than 
the rate of confirmed food allergy.27 When looking at parental pairs, we used pairwise 
analyses to minimize the possibility of any bias related to household environmental 
exposures. Also, given our specific cohort of parents of children with food allergy, it is 
important to note that our data is likely not generalizable to the general population.

 In this cohort with a high prevalence of self-reported allergic disease, we described elevated 
rates of both food and aeroallergen sensitization beyond what has been seen in an unselected 
adult population.9 Notably, fathers in this cohort had higher levels of sensitization to 
individual foods and environmental aeroallergens as well as total serum IgE levels consistent 
with previous reports.28 However, the majority of sIgE sensitization was low level so clinical 
reactivity is unlikely. A high rate of food allergy report was also observed in those with no 
sensitization at all. This paper highlights flaws in using self-report alone to determine food 
allergy, even in this population with heightened awareness of allergic conditions. Often in 
clinical practice, if a parent has food allergy, it suggests that their child is at higher risk of 
developing food allergy. Our study suggests that using parental report of food allergy as a 
risk factor is unreliable. Other known risk factors such as infant eczema may be better for 
predicting the risk of future food allergy in a child. More epidemiologic studies of food 
allergy in the adult population are needed which include proper testing and food challenge 
outcomes to better understand sensitization and heritability.
