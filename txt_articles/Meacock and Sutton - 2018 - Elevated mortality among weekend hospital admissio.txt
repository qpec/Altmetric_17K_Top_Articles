Introduction Patients admitted to hospital in an 
emergency at weekends have been found to experience 
higher mortality rates than those admitted during the 
week. The National Health Service (NHS) in England has 
introduced four priority clinical standards for emergency 
hospital care with the objective of reducing deaths 
associated with this ’weekend effect’. This study aimed to 
determine whether adoption of these clinical standards 
is associated with the extent to which weekend mortality 
is elevated.
Methods We used publicly available data on 
performance against the four priority clinical standards in 
2015 and estimates of Trusts’ weekend effects between 
2013/2014 and 2015/2016 for 123 NHS Trusts in 
England. We examined whether adoption of the priority 
clinical standards was associated with the extent to 
which weekend mortality was elevated, and changes 
over a 3 year period in the extent to which mortality was 
elevated.
results Levels of achievement of two of the four clinical 
standards (ongoing review and access to diagnostic 
services) had small positive associations with the 
magnitude of the weekend effect in 2015/2016. Levels 
of achievement of the remaining two standards (time to 
first consultant review and access to consultant directed 
interventions) had small negative associations with the 
magnitude of the weekend effect in 2015/2016. No 
association was statistically significant. The same pattern 
was observed in the associations between achievement 
of the standards and changes in the magnitudes of the 
weekend effect between 2013/2014 and 2015/2016.
Discussion We found no association between Trusts’ 
performance against any of the four standards and 
the current magnitude of their weekend effects, or the 
change in their weekend effects over the past 3 years. 
These findings cast doubt on whether adoption of 
seven day clinical standards in the delivery of emergency 
hospital services will be successful in reducing the 
weekend effect.
InTrODuCTIOn
Patients admitted to hospital in an emergency at 
weekends have been found to experience higher 
mortality rates than those admitted during the 
week.1–4 This finding has been noted in many 
high income countries, including the UK, USA and 
Canada.5 6 However, the reasons for this ‘weekend 
effect’ are contested.7–11 Numerous potential expla-
nations have been put forward, including case mix 
and severity differences,12 13 artefactual differences 
in coding,14 and differing levels of staffing and 
service provision.3 Focusing on the last of these 
potential explanations, the National Health Service 
(NHS) in England has introduced four priority clin-
ical standards for emergency hospital care with the 
stated aim being "to reduce the deaths associated 
with the ‘weekend effect’ ".15 Compliance with 
these standards is mandatory for all NHS hospitals 
by 2020 as part of the seven 
day services policy.16 
Commissioners have been encouraged to use the 
threat of financial sanctions to ensure that prog-
ress is made against the clinical standards under 
the Commissioning for Quality and Innovation 
framework.3 
The clinical standards were developed by expert 
consensus based on existing recommendations 
of best practice from national and professional 
bodies.3 However, the accompanying review 
presented no evidence that the adoption of these 
standards would reduce mortality.17 18 The four 
standards require consultant presence, yet a recent 
point prevalence survey of consultant presence 
across 127 NHS hospital Trusts in England found 
no association between consultant presence and 
ratios of weekend to weekday mortality.19
Focus on achievement of these four priority stan-
dards may divert effort away from other quality 
improvement initiatives, or mean that limited 
Key messages
What is already known on this subject
 
► Patients admitted to hospital in an emergency 
at weekends have been found to experience 
higher mortality rates than those admitted 
during the week.
 
► The NHS in England has introduced four priority 
clinical standards for emergency hospital care 
to reduce this weekend effect.
 
► There is no evidence that adoption of these 
standards will reduce mortality.
What this study adds
 
► In this retrospective study of 123 Trusts in 
England, Trusts' performances on the clinical 
standards was not associated with the current 
magnitude of, or changes in, their weekend 
effects over the past 3 years.
 
► Achievement of seven day clinical standards 
for emergency hospital care may not reduce 
weekend mortality.

resources become diverted to low risk patients who will expe-
rience little or no benefit. It is therefore important to establish 
whether adoption of the clinical standards is associated with an 
improvement in mortality.
We examined the association between adoption of the clin-
ical standards and the extent to which mortality was elevated 
among weekend admissions across all hospital Trusts in England. 
We used the most recent data available. We considered whether 
achievement of the priority clinical standards was associated 
with the extent to which weekend mortality was elevated, and 
changes over a 3 
year period in the extent to which mortality 
was elevated.

Data
We obtained publicly available data on Trusts’ performances 
against the four priority clinical standards from the My NHS 
website.20 These four standards are: time to first consultant 
review; access to diagnostics; access to consultant directed inter-
ventions; and ongoing consultant review (table 1). The data were 
downloaded on 7 February 2017 and are described as relating to 
the summer of 2015.
The data record, for each Trust, how many specialties achieved 
each standard out of a total number of eligible specialties. In all 
Trusts, there are 14 specialties eligible for the access to diag-
nostics standard and nine interventions eligible for the access 
to consultant directed interventions standard. The number 
of eligible specialties for the two remaining standards varied 
across Trusts, with maximums of 10 specialties for the time to 
consultant review standard and 13 specialties for the ongoing 
consultant review standard. For the Trusts that had less than 
the maximum number of eligible specialties for these two stan-
dards, we re-scaled the measure of achievement to be compa-
rable across Trusts (see table 2 note). For the 12% of Trusts that 
reported achievement at multiple sites, we selected the records 
with the maximum number of eligible specialties.
We obtained figures on mortality within 30 days of admission 
from the NHS Digital website, which have been published to aid 
research into 7 
day NHS provision.21 We focussed on the indi-
cator comparing the odds of mortality for patients admitted at 
the weekend (Saturday and Sunday) to the odds of mortality for 
patients admitted midweek (Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday). 
We present results for the indicator relating to emergency admis-
sions only, and for the indicator relating to all admissions. 
However, we believe the indicator relating only to emergency 
admissions to be the most appropriate indicator in relation to 
the emergency care clinical standards, and so present these as 
our primary results.
These mortality figures are publicly reported annually at 
the Trust level, and are available for three financial years 
2013/2014–2015/2016. They are presented as ORs, and are 
risk adjusted for primary and secondary diagnoses, age, gender, 
deprivation, ethnicity, seasonality, admission source (usual place 
of residence vs other), admission method (emergency vs elec-
tive) and prior admission history over the past year,22 using a 
methodology similar to that employed by Freemantle et al.1 
Table 1 Priority clinical standards for seven day services
standard
Description
Time to first consultant review All emergency admissions must be seen and have a thorough clinical assessment by a suitable consultant as soon as possible but at the latest 
within 14 hours from the time of arrival at hospital
Access to diagnostics
Hospital inpatients must have scheduled 7 day access to diagnostic services such as x-ray, ultrasound, CT, MRI, echocardiography, endoscopy, 
bronchoscopy and pathology. Consultant directed diagnostic tests and completed reporting will be available 7 days a week:
 
► Within 1 hour for critical patients
 
► Within 12 hours for urgent patients
 
► Within 24 hours for non-urgent patients
Access to consultant directed 
interventions
Hospital inpatients must have timely 24 hour access, 7 days a week, to consultant directed interventions that meet the relevant specialty 
guidelines, either on site or through formally agreed networked arrangements, with clear protocols, such as:
 
► Critical care
 
► Interventional radiology
 
► Interventional endoscopy
 
► Emergency general surgery
Ongoing review
(A) All patients on the AMU, ASU and ITU, and other high dependency areas, are seen and reviewed by a consultant TWICE DAILY (including all 
acutely ill patients directly transferred and others who deteriorate)
(B) Once transferred from the acute area of the hospital to a general ward, patients should be reviewed during a consultant delivered ward round 
at least ONCE EVERY 24 hours, 7 days a week, unless it has been determined that this would not affect the patient’s care pathway.

Deprivation is measured as relative deprivation in 32 
844 small 
areas in England called lower layer super output areas, with a 
mean population of 1500.23 The lower layer super output area 
of residence is originally derived from an individual’s postcode. 
The data used to produce the mortality indicator were orig-
inally sourced from Hospital Episode Statistics data linked to 
the Office for National Statistics death registrations data.
Analysis
We related Trusts’ weekend effect ORs to their achievement of 
each priority clinical standard using multivariable linear regres-
sion models.
We began by relating the weekend effect in the latest financial 
year (2015/2016) to achievement of the standards in the summer 
of that financial year. However, it is possible that this correla-
tion could be confounded if the Trusts who made the most 
progress towards achieving the standards are those who previ-
ously had larger weekend effects prior to the measurement of 
the standards. To investigate this possibility, we also examine the 
association between the change in the weekend effect between 
2013/2014 and 2015/2016 and levels of achievement of the 
standards in summer 2015.
As the published weekend effect ORs are non-linear trans-
formations of the underlying mortality rates, we also repeated 
the analysis using logged values of the OR values. We related 
the logged weekend effect OR in the latest financial year 
(2015/2016) to achievement of the standards in the summer of 
that financial year. Finally, we examined the association between 
the change in the logged weekend effect OR between 2013/2014 
and 2015/2016 and the levels of achievement of the standards 
in summer 2015.
This study utilised publicly available data and did not require 
ethics approval.
resulTs
The weekend effect statistics are produced for 136 Trusts. Infor-
mation on achievement of the clinical standards is not available 
for 13 of these Trustsi. Our analysis therefore contains data on 
123 Trusts. The weekend effect for emergency admissions in 
2015/2016 was not significantly different among the 13 Trusts 
that did not report their achievement of the standards compared 
with the 123 Trusts that did (1.139 vs 1.119, difference=0.019, 
95% 
CI −0.025 to 0.064). The change in the weekend effect 
between 2013/2014 and 2015/2016 was not significantly 
different between the 13 Trusts that did not report their achieve-
ment of the standards compared with the 123 Trusts that did 
(0.029 vs 0.004, difference=0.025, 95% 
CI −0.037 to 0.088). 
Descriptive statistics summarising Trusts’ performances against 
the four priority clinical standards in the summer of 2015 are 
shown in table 2. There was large variation across Trusts for each 
standard and in average (mean) national performance across the 
four standards. Trust performance was highest against the access 
to consultant directed interventions standard, with an average 
of 8.1 of 9 (90%) eligible specialties meeting this target within 
each Trust. Trust performance was lowest against the time to first

Information on achievement of the clinical standards is not available for 
the following 13 NHS foundation Trusts: University Hospitals Bristol;

consultant review standard, with on average 4.9 of 10 (49%) 
specialties meeting this target. An average of 7.0 of 13 (54%) 
specialties within each Trust met the ongoing review standard, 
with 10.7 of 14 (76%) achieving the target for access to diag-
nostic services. Trust performance ranged from 0% to 100% of 
specialties meeting the standards for ongoing review, access to 
consultant directed interventions and time to first consultant 
review. However, the lowest achievement observed against the 
access to diagnostic services standard was 3 of 14 areas, with the 
maximum again 100%.
The weekend effect was expressed as an OR, meaning that a 
value of 1.000 represents no risk adjusted difference in mortality 
rates between weekday and weekend admissions. The average 
Trust weekend effect in 2015/2016 for emergency admissions 
was 1.119. The magnitudes of Trusts’ weekend effects varied in 
the range 0.920 to 1.360 (SD=0.081). The average change over 
time between 2015/2016 and 2013/2014 in Trusts’ weekend 
effects was 0.004. There was substantial variation in these 
changes (SD=0.118), with the largest decrease for any Trust 
equal to −0.340 and the largest increase equal to 0.380. The 
average change was not significantly different from 0 (mean 
change 0.004, 95% 
CI −0.017 to 0.025).
The correlations between the levels of achievement of each 
of the four standards are shown in table 3. These correlations 
were all positive but the vast majority were weak. There was 
a moderate (r=0.348, 95% 
CI 0.182 to 0.494) correlation 
between achievement of the time to first consultant review stan-
dard and the ongoing review standard.
The levels of achievement of two of the four clinical standards 
(ongoing review and access to diagnostic services) had small posi-
tive associations with the level of the weekend effect for emer-
gency admissions in 2015/2016 (table 4). Levels of achievement 
of the remaining two standards (time to first consultant review 
and access to consultant directed interventions) had small nega-
tive associations with the level of the weekend effect for emer-
gency admissions in 2015/2016. No association was statistically 
significant. The results using the logged values of the weekend 
effect ORs for emergency admissions in 2015/2016 were very 
similar, and again no association was statistically significant.
The relationships between levels of achievement of the 
standards and the magnitudes of the weekend effect ORs for 
emergency admissions in 2015/2016 are also presented graph-
ically in figure 1. These graphs illustrate that performance 
against the standards for time to first consultant review and 
ongoing review were fairly evenly spread across the full range 
of performance. Conversely, performance on the standards

Trusts achieving compliance in at least 50% of eligible special-
ties. Sixty-seven (54%) of the 123 Trusts reported providing 
access to consultant directed interventions in all nine eligible 
specialties. These graphs confirm the lack of consistent rela-
tionship between achievement of the standards and the magni-
tudes of Trusts’ weekend effects.
The same pattern was observed in the associations between 
achievement of the standards and the changes in the weekend 
effect for emergency admissions within Trusts between 
2013/2014 and 2015/2016 (table 4). The levels of achieve-
ment of two of the four clinical standards (ongoing review and 
access to diagnostic services) had positive associations with the 
changes in the weekend effects. Levels of achievement of the 
remaining two standards (time to first consultant review and 
access to consultant directed interventions) had negative associ-
ations with the changes in the weekend effects. No association 
was statistically significant. The results using the changes in the 
logged weekend effect ORs for emergency admissions between 
2013/2014 and 2015/2016 were very similar, and again no asso-
ciation was statistically significant.
The results using the weekend effects published for all admis-
sions were very similar, and again no association was statistically 
significant (table 5).

DIsCussIOn
Four priority clinical standards for emergency care have been 
introduced in England with the aim of reducing the number of 
deaths associated with the weekend effect. However, we found 
that adoption of these clinical standards for seven 
day services 
was not associated with the extent to which mortality was 
elevated for patients admitted at the weekend. We found no 
association between Trusts’ performances against any of the four 
standards and the current magnitude of their weekend effects, or 
the change in their weekend effects over the past 3 
years.
The High intensity Specialist Led Acute Care (HiSLAC) study 
has previously shown that elevated weekend mortality in England 
was not associated with variations across hospitals in the extent 
to which senior doctors were present on Sundays compared with 
Wednesdays.19 While this was the first study to report differ-
ences between weekday and weekend medical staffing levels, it 
focused on whether senior doctors were present rather than the 
activities they undertook or the processes of care provided. We 
used information reported by organisations on their compliance 
with the priority clinical standards, which encompass the speed 
and frequency at which patients are seen by consultants, and 
the availability of wider diagnostic and interventional services. 
Nonetheless, our results are complementary to the HiSLAC find-
ings, that the extent to which weekend mortality was elevated 
was not associated with available measures of care provision. In 
addition, we also showed that levels of achievement were not 
associated with changes in the weekend effect over time.
There are at least three possible explanations for the lack of 
relationship between achievement of the standards and elevated 
weekend mortality. First, this could be a result of poor quality 
data on Trusts’ compliance. We are unable to check the veracity 
of these data. Nonetheless, these are the figures on which Trusts 
are assessed and on which NHS England will track progress 
towards meeting the commitment to seven 
day services, and so 
finding that the reported levels of achievement are not associ-
ated with mortality is important.
Second, it is possible that the data on compliance against the 
standards are accurate, but the standards themselves are not 
effective in reducing mortality. Given the absence of evidence 
supporting a causal link between the standards and mortality, 
this would not be unexpected. While it is unlikely that offering 
this standard of care to all patients would result in any direct 
harm, doing so diverts resources and attention away from other 
potential care provision and therefore has an opportunity cost.
Finally, the weekend effect in mortality may be the wrong 
metric by which to judge the benefits of the seven 
day services 
policy. We have previously demonstrated that the weekend effect 
is driven by a reduction in admission volumes at the weekend 
rather than an increase in the number of deaths.7 If the weekend 
effect is indeed a statistical artefact, then it will not be reduced 
by changing care provision.
There is a need for the publication of statistics tracking the 
progress of the seven 
day services policy and the impact this has 
on patient outcomes for those admitted both at the weekend and 
during the week. These should link outcomes to care provision, 
and track the volumes and composition of admissions throughout 
the week in addition to mortality rates. Implementing seven 
day 
services has been estimated to cost £1.07–1.43bn,18 most of 
which relates to recruitment of additional medical staff,24 yet 
there is currently no evidence that this initiative has resulted in 
any patient benefit.
limitations
Information on achievement of the clinical standards was not 
available for 13 of the Trusts for which NHS Digital produces 
weekend effect figures. However, we found no significant differ-
ence between the magnitudes of the weekend effects reported 
for these 13 Trusts and the 123 Trusts for which performance 
data were available. We examined the number of specialties that 
achieved the standards, not which specialties these were. The 
achievement of the standards may be more important in some 
specialties than others, but our analytical approach is consistent 
with the measurement and reporting of the standards which 
accords each specialty equal importance. Our ability to detect 
statistically significant results is unavoidably restricted by the 
sample size of 123 Trusts. Nonetheless, the pattern of two posi-
tive and two negative associations between achievement of the 
four standards and mortality is further evidence of no systematic 
relationship.
Trusts’ performances against the clinical standards is currently 
only available at one point in time. The absence of informa-
tion on historical figures means that we are unable to examine 
whether Trusts have responded to the introduction of the priority 
standards, and cannot investigate whether increasing achieve-
ment reduces mortality. Nonetheless, we examined whether 
current levels of achievement were associated with levels of, and 
reductions in, mortality and found no statistically significant 
associations.

This is the first study to examine the association between Trusts’ 
performances against the four priority clinical standards and 
the mortality figures produced by the national information 
body in order to monitor the progress of the seven

evidence questioning the link between levels of service provi-
sion and weekend death rates.7 19 While implementation of these

Original article
standards is unlikely to result in any direct harm to patients, 
the requirements may divert care away from the most high risk 
patients, limiting clinicians’ abilities to prioritise patients based 
on their professional judgement. Compulsory compliance across 
all patients and specialties may therefore not be the best way to 
allocate scarce NHS resources or increase the overall quality of 
care provided. The lack of association between the stated aims 
of the seven 
day services policy and the clinical standards being 
introduced to meet these aims suggests that the four priority 
clinical standards should be reviewed before compliance for all 
NHS hospitals is mandated in 2020.
