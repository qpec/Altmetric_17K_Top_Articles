Approximately 3 million American adults reported active 
epilepsy* in 2015 (1). Active epilepsy, especially when seizures 
are uncontrolled, poses substantial burdens because of somatic, 
neurologic, and mental health comorbidity; cognitive and 
physical dysfunction; side effects of antiseizure medications; 
higher injury and mortality rates; poorer quality of life; and 
increased financial cost (2). Thus, prompt diagnosis and seizure 
control (i.e., seizure-free in the 12 months preceding the survey) 
confers numerous clinical and social advantages to persons with 
active epilepsy. To obtain recent and reliable estimates of active 
epilepsy and seizure control status in the U.S. population, CDC 
analyzed aggregated data from the 2013 and the 2015 National 
Health Interview Surveys (NHISs). Overall, an annual esti-
mated 2.6 million (1.1%) U.S. adults self-reported having active 
epilepsy, 67% of whom had seen a neurologist or an epilepsy 
specialist in the past year, and 90% of whom reported taking 
epilepsy medication. Among those taking epilepsy medication, 
only 44% reported having their seizures controlled. A higher 
prevalence of active epilepsy and poorer seizure control were 
associated with low family income, unemployment, and being 
divorced, separated, or widowed. Use of epilepsy medication 
was higher among adults who saw an epilepsy specialist in the 
past year than among those who did not. Health care and public 
health should ensure that adults with uncontrolled seizures 
have appropriate care and self-management support in order to 
promote seizure control, improve health and social outcomes, 
and reduce health care costs.
NHIS is an annual, nationally representative household 
survey of the U.S. civilian, noninstitutionalized population.† 
* Among those reporting that a doctor or health professional had told them 
they had a seizure disorder or epilepsy, those who reported taking medication, 
having had one or more seizures in the past year, or both were considered to 
have active epilepsy.
† https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhis/index.htm.
Epilepsy data were collected in the NHIS Sample Adult com-
ponent, which includes one randomly selected adult aged 
≥18 years from each randomly selected household. In 2013, 
34,557 adults (61.2% final response rate) responded to the 
survey, and in 2015, 33,672 adults (55.2% final response 
rate) responded.§ Data for 2013 and 2015 were aggregated to 
provide more reliable estimates (58.2% combined response 
rate). After excluding respondents with missing information 
on epilepsy history, 68,174 (99.9%) respondents were included 
in the analysis.

Adult respondents answered three questions about epilepsy 
to identify persons with active epilepsy and one question 
regarding specialty care.¶ These case-ascertainment questions 
have been validated for use in community surveillance (3). 
Prevalence of active epilepsy and percentages of respondents 
with epilepsy who had seen a neurologist or epilepsy special-
ist in the past year, who were taking epilepsy medication, and 
whose seizures were controlled (i.e., had no seizures during 
the past year) among those taking epilepsy medication were 
estimated for each survey year, both survey years, overall, and 
by selected sociodemographic characteristics. The percentages 
of adults taking epilepsy medication and the distribution of 
seizure frequencies among those with active epilepsy by epilepsy 
specialty care were also estimated. Prevalences and percent-
ages were age-standardized to the projected 2000 U.S. adult 
population by four age groups: 18–34, 35–54, 55–64, and 
≥65 years. Unless otherwise noted, the relative standard error 
of all estimates was <30.0%. Statistical software that accounted 
for the respondent sampling weights and the NHIS complex 
sample design was used for analysis. All reported differences 
between subgroups were statistically significant (p<0.05 by 
two-tailed t-tests).
¶ 1) “Have you ever been told by a doctor or other health professional that you 
have a seizure disorder or epilepsy?” 2) “Are you currently taking any medicine 
to control your seizure disorder or epilepsy?” 3) “Think back to last year about 
the same time. About how many seizures of any type have you had in the past 
year?” and 4) “In the past year have you seen a neurologist or epilepsy specialist 
for your epilepsy or seizure disorder?”
Summary
What is already known about this topic?
Approximately 3 million American adults have active epilepsy 
(doctor-diagnosed history of epilepsy, currently taking medica-
tion or having at least one seizure in the past year, or both). 
Uncontrolled seizures harm health, impair quality of life, and 
increase health care costs.
What is added by this report?
Although 90% of adults with active epilepsy were taking 
epilepsy medication, less than half (44%) of those taking 
medications were seizure-free in the past year. Seizures were 
more common among persons with lower household income, 
the unemployed, and the divorced, separated, or widowed.
What are the implications for public health practice?
Health care and public health should ensure that adults with 
uncontrolled seizures have appropriate care and self-manage-
ment support in order to promote seizure control, improve 
health and social outcomes, and reduce health care costs.
During 2013 and 2015, the annual prevalence of active 
epilepsy was 1.1% (approximately 2.6 million adults) and 
was significantly higher in 2015 (1.2%) than in 2013 (0.9%). 
The age-adjusted prevalence of active epilepsy was signifi-
cantly higher among respondents who were non-Hispanic 
white (white) and non-Hispanic black (black); never married, 
divorced, separated, or widowed; had less than high school 
diploma; were unemployed, or living in lower-income families

(e.g., families earning <200% of federal poverty level [FPL]) 
than among other groups (Table).
The percentage of respondents with active epilepsy who had 
seen a neurologist or an epilepsy specialist in the past year was 
67%. This percentage was significantly higher among respon-
dents aged 18–34 years, with at least some college education, 
or who lived in the Northeast than that among respondents 
aged ≥55 years, who had less than a high school education, or 
who lived in other regions.
Ninety percent of respondents with active epilepsy took 
epilepsy medication, and this percentage did not significantly 
differ by sociodemographic characteristics. Among respondents 
taking epilepsy medication, 44% reported that their seizures 
were controlled in the past year. The prevalence of seizure 
control was significantly higher among adults aged ≥65 years 
(62.7%) than among those aged 35–54 years (36.9%);  among 
persons who were married/cohabiting (50.0%) than among 
those who were divorced, separated, or widowed (31.5%); 
among persons who were employed (54.3%) than among those 
who were unemployed (37.7%); and among those with higher 
family incomes (≥200% of FPL; 55.3%) than among those 
from lower income households (<200% of FPL; 33.2%). By 
region, the prevalence of seizure control among respondents 
with epilepsy taking epilepsy medication who lived in the 
Northeast (60.3%) was significantly higher than those who 
lived in the South (37.5%).

Among adults with active epilepsy, the age-adjusted preva-
lence of taking epilepsy medication was higher among those 
who saw an epilepsy specialist in the past year (95.4%) than 
among those who did not (78.1%); however, seizure frequency 
among those with active epilepsy did not differ significantly 
between those who did and did not see a specialist in the past 
year (Figure).
Discussion
The number of adults reporting that they have active epilepsy 
has significantly increased from 2010 (2.3 million) (4) to 2015 
(3 million), with about 724,000 more cases identified from 
2013 to 2015. In 2010, just over half (52.8%) of adults with 
active epilepsy saw a neurologist or epilepsy specialist (4). This 
study found that approximately two thirds (65.7% in 2013 and 
68.3% in 2015) of adults with epilepsy saw a specialist. Most 
(90%) respondents with active epilepsy were taking epilepsy 
medication. Epilepsy medication use, but not reduced seizure 
frequency, was more common among those who had seen an 
epilepsy specialist; however, only 44% of respondents who 
took epilepsy medication had their seizures controlled in the 
past year. These results suggest that apart from the improve-
ment associated with prompt diagnosis and treatment, other 
factors that might affect seizure control need to be addressed. 
The finding that blacks and respondents with less education 
and lower income had higher prevalences of active epilepsy is

consistent with previous reports (4,5). This study also found 
that poor seizure control was associated with low income, 
unemployment, and being divorced, separated, or widowed. 
Socioeconomic disadvantage among adults with active epilepsy 
might preclude their accessing health care including specialty 
care (because of barriers such as cost and transportation) (2), 
thus affecting seizure control. More importantly, socioeco-
nomic disadvantage (e.g., less education) and social isolation 
(e.g., lack of social support associated with being divorced, 
separated, or widowed) (2) might lead to nonadherence to 
epilepsy medication (6), an important clinical factor that 
significantly hinders seizure control (6,7).
Among adults taking epilepsy medication, those aged 
≥65 years had better seizure control than among younger 
adults aged 35–54 years. This finding is also consistent with a 
previous report (8). The apparent better response to epilepsy 
medication in older adults might be attributable to differences 
in seizure etiology, drug pharmacokinetics, or better adherence 
to prescribed antiseizure medication regimens, possibly because 
of their experience with other chronic conditions or better 
access to care, including Medicare prescription drug coverage.
Only 44% of respondents with active epilepsy on epi-
lepsy medication in this study were seizure-free in the past 
year. According to the Institute of Medicine, about 70% of 
all patients with epilepsy might become seizure-free under 
appropriate epilepsy treatment (2). To optimize seizure con-
trol, clinicians’ decisions to treat epilepsy should be based on 
individualized assessments of both disease-based (e.g., age of 
disease onset, seizure etiology, type, and comorbid conditions) 
and treatment-based factors (e.g., adherence to antiepileptic 
drugs), as well as patients’ personal characteristics, preferences, 
and their social context (6,7,9). Improving access to care, pro-
viding social support and epilepsy self-management education 
to improve medication adherence, and encouraging other self-
management behaviors such as avoiding seizure triggers (e.g., 
sleep deprivation, stress, flashing lights, and alcohol or drug 
use) might also improve seizure control (10).
The findings in this report are subject to at least five limi-
tations. First, estimates of epilepsy prevalence are based on 
self-reported data and are subject to error; however, because 
previous studies have validated the NHIS epilepsy questions, 
this bias is expected to be small (3). Second, active epilepsy 
might be overestimated because of the mistaken reporting of 
other nonepileptic seizures (5) or underestimated because of 
respondents’ reluctance to disclose epilepsy (2), as well as by the 
exclusion of institutionalized adults (e.g., adults in long-term 
care facilities and incarcerated persons) from NHIS. Third, 
these surveys did not objectively measure medication adher-
ence or seizure frequency. Fourth, although respondent survey 
weights were adjusted to the U.S. population, the potential 
for nonresponse bias cannot be eliminated, given the low 
overall response rate (58.2%). Finally, the lack of differences 
in seizure frequency by seeing a specialist could be confounded 
by epilepsy severity and other untreated comorbidity such as 
mood disorder. However, no data regarding epilepsy severity 
is collected on NHIS
These findings highlight both the substantial burden of 
uncontrolled seizures in adults with epilepsy and the persistent

sociodemographic and socioeconomic disparities in active 
epilepsy prevalence, access to neurologic specialty care, and 
seizure control. Health care and public health should ensure 
that adults with uncontrolled seizures have appropriate care 
and self-management support in order to promote seizure 
control, improve health and social outcomes, and reduce 
health care costs.
