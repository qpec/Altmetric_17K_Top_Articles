ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND Platelet inhibitory effects induced by oral P2Y12 receptor antagonists are delayed in patients with
ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI),
which may be attributed to impaired absorption affecting drug pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD).
Crushing tablets has been suggested to lead to more favorable PK/PD profiles. To date, no studies have investigated the
PK/PD effects of crushing prasugrel.
OBJECTIVES This study sought to determine whether crushing prasugrel is associated with more favorable drug
bioavailability and platelet inhibitory effects compared with whole tablets in STEMI patients undergoing PPCI.
METHODS Our prospective, randomized, open-label study assessed STEMI patients undergoing PPCI (n ¼ 52) who were
treated with a prasugrel 60-mg loading dose (LD) either as whole or crushed tablets. PK/PD analyses were performed at
7 time points. PD effects were measured as P2Y12 reaction units and platelet reactivity index, and PK by plasma levels of
prasugrel’s active metabolite.
RESULTS Compared with whole tablets, crushed prasugrel led to reduced P2Y12 reaction units by 30 min post-LD,
which persisted at 1, 2 (164 vs. 95; least square mean difference ¼ 68; 95% confidence interval: 10 to 126; pri-
mary endpoint), and 4 h post-LD. Significant differences were no longer present at 6 h post-LD. Parallel findings
were shown with platelet reactivity index. Accordingly, high on-treatment platelet reactivity rates were reduced
with crushed prasugrel. PK analyses showed a >3-fold faster absorption with crushed compared with whole
prasugrel.
CONCLUSIONS In STEMI patients undergoing PPCI, crushed prasugrel leads to faster drug absorption, and
consequently, more prompt and potent antiplatelet effects compared with whole tablet ingestion. (Pharmacological

 P
rasugrel
is
an
orally
administered
third-generation thienopyridine that
irreversibly
inhibits
the
platelet
P2Y12 receptor (1). Compared with clopidog-
rel, prasugrel has more prompt, potent, and
predictable
antiplatelet
effects,
which
in
turn leads to a greater reduction in athero-
thrombotic events in patients with acute
coronary syndrome (ACS) undergoing percu-
taneous coronary intervention (PCI) (2,3).
Importantly, the benefits of prasugrel have
shown to be consistent across several sub-
groups, including among patients with ST-
segment
elevation
myocardial
infarction
(STEMI) (4,5). Over the past years, there has
been a considerable increase in the use of
prasugrel,
particularly
in
STEMI
patients
undergoing primary percutaneous coronary interven-
tion (PPCI) (6). Despite these therapeutic advance-
ments,
studies
have
demonstrated
delayed
antiplatelet effects of oral P2Y12 inhibitors, including
prasugrel, in STEMI patients undergoing PPCI, who
demonstrate persistently elevated rates of high on-
treatment platelet reactivity (HPR) for several hours
after drug administration (7–10). Given the higher
risk of periprocedural thrombotic events in STEMI
patients undergoing PPCI, these observations under-
score the need to achieve effective platelet inhibition
more promptly (11).
The delayed onset and attenuated antiplatelet ef-
fects, which have been consistently observed in
STEMI patients treated with oral P2Y12 receptor in-
hibitors, have been attributed to impaired drug ab-
sorption resulting in reduced drug bioavailability
(10,12). Therefore, strategies to increase bioavail-
ability
of
orally
administered
P2Y12
receptor
in-
hibitors have been advocated for STEMI patients,
such as increasing the dosing regimen or crushing
tablets (10,13–17). To date, there are no studies that
have specifically assessed the pharmacokinetic (PK)
and pharmacodynamic (PD) consequences of crushing
prasugrel tablets. Therefore, the aim of this PK/PD
study was to investigate whether crushing prasugrel
is associated with more favorable drug bioavailability
and platelet inhibitory effects compared with whole
tablets in STEMI patients undergoing PPCI.
METHODS
STUDY DESIGN AND POPULATION. This was a pro-
spective,
randomized,
open-label,
parallel-design
study investigating the PK and PD of a 60-mg loading
dose (LD) of prasugrel administered as whole or
crushed tablets in STEMI patients undergoing PPCI
(NCT02212028). All consecutive patients presenting
with STEMI at the University of Florida Health–-
Jacksonville
were
screened.
Patients
needed
to
meet all of the following inclusion criteria to be
considered eligible for the study: 1) between 18 and 75
years of age; 2) present with STEMI and treated with
PPCI; and 3) able to provide written informed con-
sent. STEMI was defined as chest pain of <12 h
duration and ST-segment elevation >0.1 mV in at
least 2 contiguous leads. Patients were excluded if
any of the following exclusion criteria were present:
1) age >75 years; 2) body weight <60 kg; 3) on treat-
ment with any P2Y12 receptor inhibitor in the previous
7 days; 4) known allergy to aspirin or prasugrel; 5)
previous
stroke
or
transient
ischemic
attack;
6)
known blood dyscrasia or bleeding diathesis; 7) on
treatment with an oral anticoagulant; 8) treatment
with glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors (due to their
interference
with
the
VerifyNow
P2Y12
assay
[VN-P2Y12] [Accriva Diagnostics, San Diego, Califor-
nia]); 9) use of fibrinolytic agents <24 h; 10) active
bleeding; 11) known platelet count <80 � 106/ml; 12)
known hemoglobin <10 g/dl; 13) hemodialysis or
known creatinine clearance <30 ml/min; 14) known
severe hepatic dysfunction; 15) patients requiring
endotracheal
intubation;
and
16)
pregnant
or
lactating
females.
The
study
complied
with
the
Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the
Western Institutional Review Board, and all patients
gave their written informed consent.
RANDOMIZATION AND STUDY PROCEDURES. Using
a computer-based randomization system, patients
were randomly assigned (1:1) in an open-label manner
to receive a 60-mg LD of prasugrel (6 10-mg tablets)
orally administered as either whole or crushed tab-
lets. Investigators and patients were aware of treat-
ment
assignment.
However,
laboratory
personnel
performing PK and PD assessments were blinded.
Patients were treated as per local standard of care,
which included 325 mg aspirin and 4,000 IU of
unfractionated heparin at time of patient presenta-
tion. Access site, choice of anticoagulant, and proce-
dural
technique
were
at
the
discretion
of
the
physician. As per institutional standards, the LD of
prasugrel was administered immediately after the
procedure, defined as removal of the guiding catheter
from
the
body.
This
is
in
line
with
prior
in-
vestigations, as it enables a more homogenous pa-
tient cohort with PK/PD profiles that would not be
affected by procedural variables (i.e., length of the
procedure) (10). Whole prasugrel tablets were swal-
lowed with 50 ml of H2O. Crushed prasugrel was
prepared
using
a
commercially
available
syringe

 crusher (Welcon, Fort Worth, Texas), which allows for
preparation of crushed prasugrel in an average time
of 2 to 3 min. After 5 rotations of the crushing
mechanism, 25 ml of H2O was aspirated into the sy-
ringe and mixed by shaking the crushed pill contents
for 30 sec. This suspension was then dispensed into a
165 ml dosing cup. The syringe crusher was rinsed
using an additional 25 ml of H2O and added to the
dosing cup for a total of 50 ml suspension, which was
then
administered
orally.
A
maintenance
dose
regimen of prasugrel 10 mg once daily was started
24 h after the LD was administered. Patients were
advised to continue this maintenance dose regimen
for at least 12 months in addition to aspirin 81 mg
daily for life.
Blood
samples
for
PK
and
PD
analysis
were
collected at a total of 7 time points: baseline (after
arterial sheet insertion), 30 min, and 1, 2, 4, 6, and
24 h after administration of the randomized treat-
ment. The 24-h blood sample was collected prior to
the administration of the first 10-mg maintenance
dose of prasugrel.
PK AND PD ASSESSMENTS. PK assessments included
determination of plasma concentration of prasugrel’s
active metabolite (P-AM), as previously described
(18). Time for the maximum plasma concentration
(Tmax),
maximum
observed
plasma
concentration
(Cmax), and the area under the plasma concentration
versus time curve from time 0 to the last measura-
ble concentration (AUC0–t) were calculated. More-
over, to explore early exposure to P-AM, AUC from
time 0 to 2 h (AUC0–2) was also calculated. PD as-
sessments
included
VN-P2Y12
and
whole
blood
vasodilator-stimulated
phosphoprotein
(VASP),
which were performed according to manufacturer’s
instructions, as previously described (10,19). In brief,
the VN-P2Y12 assay (Accriva, San Diego, California)
measures platelet-induced aggregation as an increase
in light transmittance and reports results in P2Y12
reaction
units
(PRU).
VASP
phosphorylation
was
measured
by
quantitative
flow
cytometry
using
commercially
available
labeled
monoclonal
anti-
bodies according to standard protocols (Biocytex Inc.,
Marseille, France) and was used to determine the
platelet reactivity index (PRI). HPR was defined as a
PRU >208 or a PRI >50%, according to consensus
definition (20). A complete description of PK and PD
methodology is provided in the Online Appendix.
STUDY ENDPOINTS. The primary endpoint of the
study was the comparison of PRU determined by
VN-P2Y12 between whole and crushed prasugrel at 2 h
post-LD administration. The primary endpoint was
chosen at 2 h in line with previous investigations with
prasugrel in PPCI and because it is the time point by
which optimal platelet inhibition should be achieved
in non–ST-segment elevation ACS patients following
a 60-mg LD administration (9,21). Other endpoints
included between-group comparisons of: 1) platelet
reactivity, at each time point as well as over time;
2) rates of HPR; and 3) PK parameters. Given the
described association between use of morphine and
HPR in patients treated with PPCI (10,22), exploratory
analyses were conducted within each group to eval-
uate any differences in PD and PK among patients
receiving
morphine.
In-hospital
adverse
events,
including
ischemic
and
bleeding
complications,
defined according to previously reported criteria (3),
were recorded.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS. Assuming a 60 PRU differ-
ence at 2 h post-LD between the 2 arms after prasugrel
administration with a common SD of 60 PRU and 15%
rate of invalid results due to hemolysis or technical
problems, we estimated that 52 patients needed to be
randomized to obtain a 90% power and 2-sided alpha
of 0.05. Because there are no published data on
crushed prasugrel, the sample size of our study was
arbitrarily determined on the basis of data of whole
prasugrel in STEMI and in non–ST-segment elevation
ACS settings (8,9,23).
The primary population was defined as patients
who received the randomized treatment and had a
valid primary endpoint value (PRU at 2 h). The pri-
mary population was considered for analysis of PK
and PD endpoints. The treated population comprised
all patients who received any dose of study medica-
tion and was considered for analysis of safety and
adverse events. Patients vomiting within 30 min after
study drug administration were excluded from the
primary population.
Conformity
to
the
normal
distribution
was
evaluated
for
continuous
variables
with
the
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. For baseline characteris-
tics, continuous variables are expressed as mean � SD
or median (interquartile range), and categorical vari-
ables are expressed as frequencies and percentages.
The chi-square test or Fisher exact test was used to
compare
categorical
variables
between
groups,
whereas the Student t test or Mann-Whitney U test
was used to compare continuous variables. Univariate
analysis of variance (ANOVA) and analysis of covari-
ance (ANCOVA) method with a general linear model,
adjusted
for
baseline
characteristics
significantly
different between groups, were used to evaluate the
primary endpoint and all between-group compari-
sons. Mixed between within subjects, ANOVA and
ANCOVA with polynomial contrast, also adjusted for

model to evaluate the overall difference between
groups across time points. A repeated measures
ANOVA model was used to evaluate intragroup com-
parisons, and the Bonferroni approach was used to
correct for multiple comparisons. A sensitivity anal-
ysis was performed to evaluate differences in platelet
reactivity between groups in the treated population.
PK parameters were compared by the Mann-Whitney
U test. A 2-tailed p value of <0.05 was considered
to indicate a statistically significant difference for
all the analyses performed. Results are reported as
least-square means and 95% confidence interval (CI)
for the previously detailed analyses. For PK parame-
ters, Tmax is reported as median (range) and Cmax,
AUC0–t, and AUC0–2 are reported as geometric mean
(range). Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS
version 22.0 software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, Illinois).
RESULTS
Between October 15, 2014, and August 12, 2015, there
were a total of 123 patients presenting with STEMI
at our institution. Of these, 45 patients did not meet
study entry criteria, whereas 78 provided their written
informed consent to participate in the study; of these,
52 were randomized (whole tablets, n ¼ 26; crushed
tablets, n ¼ 26), representing the treated population.
A total of 50 patients (whole tablets, n ¼ 24; crushed
tablets, n ¼ 26) met criteria to be included in the
primary population. No patients were excluded due

 to vomiting. There were no challenges with timely
preparation and administration of crushed prasu-
grel, which was well tolerated with the exception
of patients reporting a bitter residual taste in 80%
of
cases.
Patient
disposition
is
summarized
in
Figure 1. Baseline characteristics are summarized in
Table 1 and were well balanced between groups,
with the exception of myocardial infarction (MI)
location. In particular, more patients with inferior
MI
were
randomized
to
whole
tablets,
whereas
more patients with anterior MI were randomized to
crushed tablets (p < 0.001). Although the use of
morphine was numerically higher in the crushed
group, this did not reach statistical significance.
Figure 2A illustrates the PD findings according to
VN-P2Y12. Baseline PRU values were similar among
patients randomized to crushed versus whole prasu-
grel tablets (p > 0.1). Although PRU levels signifi-
cantly decreased over time in both groups (p < 0.001
for both), these declined more rapidly in patients
treated with crushed prasugrel, who had platelet
reactivity already reduced by 30 min. A significant
reduction in PRU with crushed compared with whole
tablets of prasugrel was observed at 2 h after LD
administration
(164
vs.
95;
least-square
means
difference ¼ 68; 95% CI: 10 to 126; p ¼ 0.022; primary
endpoint). Compared with whole prasugrel tablets,
the crushed tablets led to reduced platelet reactivity,
which was already evident at 30 min (p ¼ 0.053) and
1 h (p < 0.001) after drug administration and persisted
for up to 4 h (p ¼ 0.023). Platelet reactivity continued
to drop in both treatment arms, with PRU levels
nonsignificantly lower with crushed prasugrel at 6 h
(p ¼ 0.102). At 24 h, platelet reactivity continued to
decline in the whole tablet group but not in crushed
tablet group, resulting in similar PRU levels at this
time point (p ¼ 0.178). During the overall 24-h study
time course, PRU levels were significantly lower with
crushed
compared
with
whole
prasugrel
tablets
(ANOVA p ¼ 0.008). Crushed prasugrel was still
significantly associated with reduced PRU levels at 2 h
(p ¼ 0.022) and during the overall 24-h study time
course (ANCOVA p ¼ 0.048) after adjusting for MI
localization. Parallel findings were observed with
VASP-PRI,
with
significant
differences
between
groups already at 30 min, which persisted at 2 h (p ¼
0.005; adjusted p ¼ 0.014) and during the overall
study time course (ANOVA p ¼ 0.001; adjusted p ¼
0.004) as shown in Figure 2B. Morphine was used in
w75% of the overall study population and was not
associated with any significant difference on the pri-
mary endpoint as well as during the overall 24-h
study time course (Online Figure 1), and there was
no treatment effect by morphine interaction.
Rates of HPR as assessed by VN-P2Y12 were mark-
edly reduced with crushed compared with whole
tablet ingestion of prasugrel (Figure 3A). In particular,
significantly reduced HPR rates were observed at

Crushed Prasugrel in STEMI
5
 30 min, 1 h, and 2 h after drug administration. Impor-
tantly, HPR was present in approximately one-half of
the patient population treated with whole tablets at
2 h. HPR rates continued to decrease after 2 h in both
treatment arms, being numerically lower at 4 h in the
crushed arm; at 6 and 24 h, HPR rates were very low
and similar between groups. HPR rates as assessed by
VASP-PRI were overall higher but showed a similar
trend compared with HPR defined by PRU (Figure 3B).
Compared with whole tablets, crushed prasugrel
was associated with faster drug absorption, leading to
higher plasma concentrations of P-AM at 30 min and
1 h and similar concentrations by 2 h (Figure 4).
The Tmax for P-AM was 0.8 h (0.5 to 4.0 h) and 3 h
(0.5 to 24.0 h) in the crushed and whole tablets groups,
respectively. Maximal P-AM plasma concentrations,
measured as Cmax, were increased by approximately
80% with crushed compared with whole prasugrel
tablets (Table 2). Although exposure to P-AM during
overall study time course (AUC0–t) was similar be-
tween treatments, exposure to P-AM during the first
2 h after LD was w3.5-fold higher with crushed pra-
sugrel (Table 2). Morphine administration was asso-
ciated with modestly reduced exposure to P-AM, but
with very similar Tmax and Cmax (Online Table 1).
A sensitivity analysis considering the treated popula-
tion showed consistent results compared with those
achieved in the primary population.
There was no major bleeding or other serious in-
hospital adverse events. There was only 1 minor
bleeding event (hematuria) in the crushed prasugrel
arm, which did not require drug discontinuation.
DISCUSSION
This is the first investigation to assess the PK and PD
profiles associated with crushing prasugrel tablets.
Our study showed that, in STEMI patients undergoing
PPCI, the use of a standard 60-mg LD of prasugrel
administered as crushed tablets was associated with
enhanced platelet inhibitory effects compared with
prasugrel administered as whole tablets, particularly
in the early hours after drug administration (Central
Illustration).
Notably,
reduced
platelet
reactivity
with crushed prasugrel was observed as early as 30
min after drug administration and persisted for up to
4 h; the differences between groups started to narrow
after 6 h. Importantly, the use of crushed tablets led
to a significant reduction in HPR rates, which is a
well-recognized marker of thrombotic risk, including
stent thrombosis, in patients treated with PCI (20). In
particular, at 2 h post-LD, approximately one-half of
patients treated with whole prasugrel tablets still had
HPR, the rate of which was more than 2-fold higher
than that observed with crushed tablets. Importantly,
consistent results were observed using 2 different PD
assays, supporting the validity of our findings. In line
with the PD data, our PK assessments showed that
crushed prasugrel was associated with an over 3-fold
faster
drug
absorption
and
nearly
2-fold
higher
maximal plasma concentration of its active metabo-
lite
compared
with
whole
tablet
administration.
Although patients had similar exposure to P-AM
during
the
overall
study
time
course,
this
was
approximately 3.5-fold higher with crushed prasugrel
during the first 2 h post-LD.
Antiplatelet therapy with a P2Y12 receptor inhibi-
tor, in addition to aspirin, is the cornerstone of

 treatment for the reduction of thrombotic events in
ACS
patients,
including
STEMI
(1).
The
new-
generation P2Y12 receptor inhibitors prasugrel and
ticagrelor are associated with more prompt, potent,
and predictable antiplatelet effects compared with
clopidogrel. These pharmacological properties trans-
late into better clinical outcomes in ACS patients
undergoing PCI, including those presenting with
STEMI (1). However, in PPCI, there is a delayed onset
of action of oral P2Y12 receptor inhibitors, which
require >2 h to exert full antiplatelet effects, and thus
exposing these high-risk patients to an increased
risk of thrombotic complications in the immediate
post-PCI period (7–10). In STEMI patients, these ob-
servations may be attributed to multiple factors.
These include hemodynamic instability, adrenergic
activation, systemic vasoconstriction, drug–drug in-
teractions, abnormal muscular activity of the gastro-
intestinal tract, nausea, and vomiting, which can lead
to impaired drug absorption (9,10,12). In a prior
investigation with ticagrelor, we demonstrated that
this delay in antiplatelet effect was mainly attributed
to an altered PK profile (“drug exposure”), with
impaired absorption in the early hours after drug
administration, which in turn led to high levels of
platelet
reactivity
and
elevated
HPR
rates
(10).

Crushed Prasugrel in STEMI

 The prognostic implications of such findings are
noteworthy given the risk of thrombotic complica-
tions in the early hours following PPCI, even with the
use of prasugrel and ticagrelor (11). These observa-
tions underscore the need for strategies that provide
enhanced platelet inhibition in the early hours after
PPCI. Because the PK/PD profiles of P2Y12 receptor
inhibitors are dose-dependent, the use of high LD
regimens has been tested (10,13–15). However, this
was associated with marginal or no additional effects
on platelet reactivity (10,13–15). Moreover, the only
randomized trial using new-generation P2Y12 receptor
inhibitors testing upstream versus in-laboratory drug
administration
as
an
attempt
to
achieve
greater
antithrombotic efficacy at the time of PPCI was not
associated with significant differences in platelet
reactivity and did not improve pre-PCI markers of
coronary reperfusion (24). Overall, these observations
suggest that impaired drug absorption has a key role
in the delayed antiplatelet effects observed with oral
P2Y12 receptor inhibitors in STEMI patients. These
findings, on the one hand, support a role for intra-
venous therapies (i.e., glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors
or cangrelor) to achieve immediate effects (7,25), but
on the other hand, also underscore the need for
strategies associated with improved absorption of
orally administered drugs.
Investigations conducted in healthy volunteers
treated with clopidogrel and ticagrelor have shown
that tablets can be safely crushed and administered,
either orally or via nasogastric tube, achieving faster
and greater bioavailability than an equal dose taken
orally as whole tablets (26,27). Recently, the MOJITO
(Mashed Or Just Integral pill of TicagrelOr) study
conducted in STEMI patients showed that crushed
ticagrelor reduced platelet reactivity and HPR rates to
a greater extent than whole tablets only at 1 h after LD
administration (16). However, this study was limited
to a single PD assay, with fewer time point measures,
and without PK assessments (16). A subsequent small
sample pilot study suggested that crushed ticagrelor
was associated with faster drug absorption than
whole tablets in the early phase after LD (17). Our
study expands upon these findings by exploring for
the first time both the PK and PD effects of crushed
prasugrel and showing, in patients undergoing PPCI,
a remarkable reduction in platelet reactivity and HPR
rates by 30 min with significant differences that
persist up to 4 h post-LD. Moreover, we demonstrate
that these PD findings are attributed to a more
favorable PK profile associated with crushing prasu-
grel tablets, which leads to faster drug absorption,
higher maximum P-AM concentrations, and greater
exposure during the first 2 h after drug administration
compared with whole tablet ingestion.
Post hoc analysis of PD studies conducted in pa-
tients undergoing PPCI have shown morphine use to
be associated with a delayed onset of action of pra-
sugrel and ticagrelor (9,22). In a prospective, ran-
domized
trial
conducted
in
patients
with
ACS,
including STEMI and non-STEMI, coadministration of
morphine led to delayed absorption and reduced
exposure to ticagrelor and its active metabolite,
resulting in lower and delayed antiplatelet effects
(28). However, in this study, STEMI presentation it-
self was found to be an independent predictor of
reduced ticagrelor exposure. In our study, we found
only a marginal effect of morphine administration on
exposure to P-AM, which did not translate into any
PD
differences,
irrespective
of
drug
preparation.
These findings are in line with a study conducted in
healthy volunteers, in which morphine decreased

 only maximal plasma concentrations of P-AM, but not
PD profiles (29). Taken together, these data support
the hypothesis that, although a drug interaction with
morphine is involved, other mechanisms may play a
major role in the pathophysiology of delayed ab-
sorption of P2Y12 receptor inhibitors in patients un-
dergoing PPCI. However, our results need to be
interpreted with caution given the post-hoc nature of
our assessments.
STUDY
LIMITATIONS. First,
our
study
was
not
designed to assess clinical outcomes. Nonetheless,
the
PD
data
provided
in
this
study
have
been
consistently associated with thrombotic events in
other
large
investigations
(20).
Furthermore,
the
clinical benefits of peri-PCI reduction of platelet
reactivity are supported by larger investigations with
the potent intravenous P2Y12 receptor antagonist
cangrelor, showing a significant reduction in early
thrombotic events (30). Of note, in these trials, can-
grelor was tested against clopidogrel therapy. Indeed,
how our strategy of crushing prasugrel tablets com-
pares with cangrelor in patients undergoing PPCI is
currently unknown and warrants further investiga-
tion. Moreover, the lack of bleeding complications
should be interpreted with caution. Indeed, larger
investigations are warranted to define the safety and
efficacy
of
crushed
prasugrel
in
PPCI.
Second,
although the use of morphine, which may impair drug
absorption, was not significantly different between
the 2 groups, they were not well-balanced. However,
morphine use was actually higher in the patients
randomized to crushed prasugrel, and did not affect
our overall study findings. Moreover, the lack of an
interaction between morphine and PK/PD profiles
needs to be interpreted with caution as the study was
not designed for this analysis and because most

 patients were treated with morphine, as per standard
of care, limiting the possibility to unravel a potential
treatment effect. Ultimately, our data cannot be
extrapolated to patients in cardiogenic shock and/or
requiring a nasogastric tube. These patients, although
in fact attractive for the use of crushed prasugrel as it
already frequently occurs in clinical practice, were
excluded from our study as they would have intro-
duced heterogeneity to our study population, poten-
tially interfering with our PK/PD assessment.
CONCLUSIONS
Our study showed that in STEMI patients undergoing
PPCI, crushed prasugrel administration is associated
with faster drug absorption and more prompt and
potent antiplatelet effects compared with whole tablet
ingestion. Although the clinical effect of our study
results warrants a larger-scale efficacy trial, our find-
ings may have potential prognostic implications given
the known association among peri-PCI platelet reac-
tivity, thrombotic events, and long-term outcomes.
