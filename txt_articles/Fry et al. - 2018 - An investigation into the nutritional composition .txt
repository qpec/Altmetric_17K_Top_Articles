Abstract 
  
1 
Background: The gluten free (GF) food market has expanded considerably but there is 
2 
limited comparative evidence for the nutritional quality and cost of GF food products. This 
3 
study aims to compare the nutrient composition and cost of GF and gluten-containing 
4 
(regular) foods across ten food categories in the UK.  
5 
Methodology: Nutritional information and cost of GF foods available in the UK (n = 679) 
6 
and comparable regular foods (n = 1045) were systematically collected from manufacturer 
7 
and supermarket websites.  Foods were classified using UK front-of-pack labelling for 
8 
content of fat, saturated fat, sugar and salt and nutrient content and cost per 100g were 
9 
identified and compared between GF and regular foods.  
10 
Results: Overall, more GF foods were classified as containing high and medium fat, 
11 
saturated fat, sugar and salt than regular foods but this was not universally consistent. 
12 
Whilst more GF bread and flour products contained high fat and sugar, fewer GF crackers 
13 
contained high fat and sugar compared to regular foods. High salt content was found more 
14 
frequently in GF than regular products. On average, GF products were 159% more 
15 
expensive than regular (£0.44/100g versus £1.14/100g).  GF items were also more likely 
16 
to be lower in fibre and protein content than regular foods.  
17 
Conclusions: Differences exist in the nutritional composition of GF and regular food. GF 
18 
food is unlikely to offer healthier alternatives to regular foods, except for those who require 
19 
a GF diet for medically diagnosed conditions, and is associated with higher costs.

Introduction  
21 
Coeliac disease is an enteropathy caused by an abnormal immune reaction to 
22 
ingestion of gluten, a protein derived from wheat, rye, and barley (1). Life-long adherence to 
23 
a gluten-free (GF) diet, comprising foods naturally GF or containing less than 20ppm 
24 
gluten, is the only treatment for individuals with coeliac disease, which has an estimated 
25 
world-wide prevalence of 1% (2-4). Those with a confirmed diagnosis of coeliac disease in 
26 
the UK are currently eligible for procurement of GF foods via monthly prescription available 
27 
from their General Practitioner, Pharmacist, or Dietitian (‘prescribed GF’ foods), however 
28 
GF products are also available for purchase from high street and online retailers 
29 
(‘commercial GF’ foods) (5). A GF diet is also recommended for individuals with other 
30 
gluten-related disorders, including gluten ataxia, dermatitis herpetiformis and non-coeliac 
31 
gluten sensitivity (6). However, many choose to follow a GF diet for other perceived health 
32 
benefits (7). Regardless of the rationale for avoiding gluten, nutritional adequacy of GF 
33 
substitute foods is important to both short- and long-term health. 
34 
Gluten is an important constituent of foods made from cereal grains or their 
35 
derivatives, providing a matrix of viscoelasticity, which, if removed, can negatively affect 
36 
the structural integrity and crumb structure of staple foods such as bread and pasta (5). No 
37 
substitute raw materials or additives have been found to replicate the qualities of gluten 
38 
and therefore products manufactured in place of traditional gluten-containing foods require 
39 
the utilisation of a combination of GF flours (e.g. rice, amaranth, potato), hydrocolloids 
40 
(e.g. xantham gum, guar gum), emulsifiers, stabilisers and enzymes (8; 9). The use of these 
41 
different ingredients can affect structure, palatability, shelf-life, mouth-feel and the 
42 
nutritional composition of the end product (8).  
43 
Gaining a better understanding of the nutrient composition of GF food compared to 
44 
regular items is likely to be important for individuals avoiding gluten (10). Furthermore, 
45 
people with coeliac disease have shown concern about the nutritional quality of the GF 
46 
  
2 
diet, and in particular the fat, sugar and salt content of some manufactured GF foods(11). 
47 
Healthcare professionals responding to such concerns or assessing diet histories would 
48 
also likely benefit from furthered understanding of nutritional composition of GF foods 
49 
available. Additionally, some consumers choose a GF diet for non-medical reasons or to 
50 
alleviate a range of symptoms not medically diagnosed, and may also benefit from more 
51 
information comparing GF and regular foods(7). Evidence suggests consumers consider 
52 
that a GF diet contributes to a healthy lifestyle, reflecting a popular perception of health 
53 
benefits and weight loss-aiding properties of GF food that has led to increasing sales in the 
54 
UK and worldwide(12-15).   
55 
Despite this increased interest in the GF diet, data comparing the nutritional 
56 
composition of GF foods to regular equivalents is limited. Studies from Europe (16) and 
57 
Australia suggest nutritional differences exist between GF and regular foods, with higher 
58 
carbohydrate and salt content (17), and lower protein content reported (15; 18). An Australian 
59 
study that evaluated over 600 GF products concluded that GF foods conferred no 
60 
additional health benefits to those individuals not medically advised to adhere to the diet 
61 
(15). However, differences in manufacturers, ingredients, products, and domestic public 
62 
health guidelines between geographical regions limit the transferability of these findings to 
63 
the UK.  
64 
Additionally, GF products tend to be more expensive than regular equivalents (19; 20) 
65 
and recent changes to UK government policy have lead to the quantities that can be 
66 
prescribed, i.e. obtained either without charge or by paying a prescription fee (as per local 
67 
policy), being reduced or removed in some areas (21).  
68 
The present study aims to fill gaps in evidence on the cost, nutritional quality and 
69 
composition of GF foods in the UK (prescribed and commercial), by comparing GF and 
70 
regular foods across ten food categories. 
 
71 
  
3 
Methods  
72 
This study involved comparisons between regular foods versus GF foods, and the GF 
73 
subgroups of prescribed GF and commercial GF foods. Analyses investigated the 
74 
differences in proportions of foods from those groups with high and medium contents of 
75 
fat, saturated fat, sugar and salt (Table 1), and differences in median nutrient content and 
76 
cost of food from those groups. 
77 
 
78 
Design and data collection 
79 
 
    Items were considered to be GF if the product packaging or description included a 
80 
declaration of GF status. Items without this explicit declaration were classified as regular. 
81 
An exhaustive list of commercial GF foods was collected from the websites of four leading 
82 
UK supermarkets: Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Morrisons, ASDA, and the online retailer Ocado (22). 
83 
The regular foods were then randomly sampled from the same five supermarkets (see 
84 
sampling). The full population of prescribed GF items was collected from the Coeliac UK 
85 
Prescribable Products List (June 2016), and nutritional data was obtained from 
86 
manufacturer’s websites (23).  
87 
Nutritional information (per 100 grams) that must be declared on packaging under EU 
88 
legislation 1169/2011 (24) (fat, saturated fat, sugar, salt and protein) was systematically 
89 
collected between September 2015 and June 2016. Fibre content per 100 g, which is not 
90 
mandated in packaging legislation, was recorded where available.  Where data were not 
91 
provided or were inconsistent on the manufacturer or supermarket websites, or on the 
92 
packaged product, the company was contacted to obtain further information. 
93 
Products without nutrition labels, such as unpackaged bakery products, and those 
94 
sold in variety packages and assortments were excluded. Duplicate items from different 
95 
supermarkets (e.g. branded items), and the same product in different weights were only 
96 
counted once. Where products were excluded from the regular sample group, a new 
97 
  
4 
random number was generated and a substitute collected. Xantham gum and egg 
98 
replacer, present on the Prescribable Products List, represented component ingredients 
99 
used in cooking and are unique to GF foods and so were excluded. Where nutritional 
100 
values were given for the cooked product, or ‘as served’, the dry weight nutrient content 
101 
was calculated using conversion factors for percentage weight change from McCance and 
102 
Widdowson’s The Composition of Foods (e.g., +138% for cooked wholewheat spaghetti) 
103 
(25). 
104 
Product prices for regular and commercial GF foods were collected from supermarket 
105 
websites. Prescribed GF products, which are either not directly funded by the consumer, 
106 
or obtained after payment of a fixed prescription fee, were excluded from the cost 
107 
comparison. Where duplicate products were found across supermarkets or where the 
108 
same product was offered in different sized packaging (with no difference in nutritional 
109 
content), an average price was calculated and the product only counted once.  
110 
 
111 
Food Categories 
112 
Products were categorised according to ten food groups: brown bread; white bread; 
113 
breakfast cereals; wholegrain flour (including mixes); white flour (including mixes); pizza 
114 
bases; wholegrain pasta; regular pasta; crackers; biscuits. These categories reflect groups 
115 
of manufactured foods traditionally containing gluten, and are similar to those previously 
116 
studied by Gibert et al. (26) and Miranda et al (16). 
117 
 
118 
Sampling 
119 
Power calculations were used to determine the size of sample required for each of the ten 
120 
food categories of regular products. Sample sizes generated for regular white flour, 
121 
wholegrain flour, pizza bases, and wholegrain pasta were larger than those available on 
122 
supermarket websites and so the full population was collected. In all other cases the 
123 
  
5 
number of regular products collected was determined by the sample size generated. Food 
124 
category search terms were entered into supermarket websites and results sorted 
125 
alphabetically (ordered A to Z) by product name. ‘Wholemeal’ was entered as an 
126 
alternative search term for ‘brown’ or ‘wholegrain’ in relevant categories, and the search 
127 
returning the most results was used. Random numbers were produced using a random 
128 
number generator and were used to select products based on their order.  
129 
 
130 
Outcomes 
131 
The primary outcome used to compare the nutritional composition of GF and regular foods 
132 
was the proportion of foods classified as containing high and medium content of fat, 
133 
saturated fat, sugar, and salt using the Department of Health (DH) traffic light system (27) 
134 
(Table 1). The DH traffic light classifications are a voluntary front-of-pack nutritional 
135 
profiling system for interpreting the nutritional quality of manufactured foods (28).  
136 
The secondary outcome was a comparison of medians and interquartile ranges 
137 
(IQR), to provide additional insight into the differences between per 100g values for all 
138 
nutrients examined, in particular for fibre and protein content. Product prices (pence per 
139 
100g) were compared for GF and regular products only.  All analyses were conducted 
140 
across the ten food categories. 
141 
 
142 
Statistical analysis 
143 
The proportion of GF foods (prescribed and commercial) in each food category with high 
144 
and medium content of fat, saturated fat, sugar, and salt were used to determine the 
145 
sample size required for each regular food category. The sample size equation used one 
146 
proportion to determine one sample with two-sided equality, as follows [n = p(1-p)((z1-
147 
α/2)+(z1- β))/(p-p0)² ] where p is the true proportion, p0 is the comparison proportion (a 
148 
value of 10% difference to p), α is the Type I error, β  is the Type II error, and z is a 
149 
  
6 
quantile function for the standard normal distribution at power level = 0.80, and type I error 
150 
= 0.05 (29; 30). The largest sample size required for each of the four nutrients was selected. 
151 
Chi-squared tests were used to compare the proportions of foods in high and medium and 
152 
high classifications for each food category. Mann-Whitney tests were used to compare the 
153 
median nutritional content and cost where data distribution was non-parametric. Unpaired 
154 
t-tests were used for categories with parametric distributions. P values were considered 
155 
statistically significant if <0.05. Data were analysed using SPSS version 23 (31). 
156

Results  
157 
A total of 1724 food items from ten food categories were collected and analysed: 
158 
prescribed GF (n=197) were compared with commercial GF foods available from 
159 
supermarkets (n=482) giving a combined total of 679 products for all GF. The combined 
160 
group of these was then compared to regular products of the same food categories 
161 
(n=1045). The number of items in each food category ranged between 3-99 for GF 
162 
products (total populations for each category) and 11-196 for regular (total available or 
163 
randomised sample of category). Fibre data were not available for 83 of the 1724 items 
164 
(4.8% of total), due to the voluntary nature of declaring fibre content on packaging. Of the 
165 
83 missing values for fibre, 40 were from GF products (48%), and 43 from regular products 
166 
(52%). Duplicate product prices were averaged for 17 items (1% of total products) and 
167 
only counted once.   
168 
 
169 
Gluten free versus non-gluten free food products  
170 
Differences in the proportion of foods classified as high and medium content were 
171 
observed in all relevant nutrients (fat, saturated fat, sugar, and salt), and across all food 
172 
categories (Table 2). Many of these (65%) indicated significantly higher proportions of 
173 
foods categorised as containing high and medium content of nutrients in GF compared to 
174 
regular products.  
175 
High and medium total fat classification significantly differed in five food categories. 
176 
With the exception of crackers, GF groups had a higher percentage of high and medium 
177 
fat products. Differences ranged from white flour (31.9% in GF, 0.0% in regular, P<0.001), 
178 
and white bread (78.1% in GF, 25.8% in regular, P<0.001). Median total fat content (g) for 
179 
GF brown bread and white bread were more than double those for regular products (Table 
180 
3).  
181 
  
8 
For saturated fat, significantly more foods were classified as containing high and 
182 
medium in GF white bread (P=0.030) and white flour (P=0.006) than in regular items. 
183 
Conversely, for crackers, significantly more regular products contained high and medium 
184 
saturated fat compared with GF varieties (76.5% versus 48.4%, P<0.001). Median content 
185 
of saturated fats were significantly different between groups in 50% of food categories, 
186 
indicating higher levels in GF products for brown bread (0.3g difference, P=0.001), white 
187 
bread (0.2g difference, P=<0.001), and white flour (0.2g difference, P=0.033), and higher 
188 
levels in regular for white pasta (0.1g difference, P=0.002) and crackers (3.3g difference, 
189 
P=<0.001).  
190 
High and medium sugar classification significantly differed in eight of ten food 
191 
categories (Table 2), 62.5% of these differences resulting from higher proportions in GF 
192 
foods compared to regular in the same food category. These differences were evident in 
193 
white bread (26.0% in GF, 4.3% in regular, P<0.001), white flour (18.8% in GF, 1.4% in 
194 
regular, P=0.001), wholegrain flour (42.9% in GF, 5.6% in regular, P<0.001), pizza bases 
195 
(45.5% in GF, 0.0% in regular, P=0.011), and white pasta (6.3% in GF, 0.0% in regular, 
196 
P=0.011). In contrast, however, the median sugar content of GF products were observed 
197 
to be significantly lower than regular across six food categories (ranging from 0.7g lower in 
198 
GF brown bread (P=0.001), to 8.0g lower in GF breakfast cereals (P <0.001)) (Table 3).  
199 
The proportions of foods containing high and medium salt were significantly different 
200 
in four food categories, with two of these being higher in the GF groups wholegrain flour 
201 
(42.9% in GF, 13.2% in regular, P=0.013) and white pasta (6.3% in GF, 0.0% in regular, 
202 
P=0.012), and two higher in the regular groups breakfast cereals (34.3% in GF, 47.5% in 
203 
regular, P=0.027) and crackers (76.4% in GF, 96.4% in regular, P=<0.001) (Table 2).  
204 
Protein content was found to be consistently lower in GF products when compared 
205 
with their regular equivalents. Significant differences were found in eight of the ten food 
206 
  
9 
categories, with differences ranging between 1.1g lower in GF biscuits (P<0.001) to 6.2g 
207 
lower in GF pizza bases (P<0.001) (Table 3).  
208 
Fibre content was found to be significantly different in 50% of food categories, the 
209 
median values for which in GF items were higher in bread products for both white (2.4g 
210 
difference, P<0.001) and brown (0.4g difference, P=0.027) classifications. In contrast, fibre 
211 
content was significantly lower for GF products in the breakfast cereal (1.2g difference, 
212 
P=0.002) and white (1.1g difference, P<0.001) and wholegrain (4.8g difference, P<0.001) 
213 
pasta categories (Table 3).  
214 
On average, GF products were 159% more expensive than regular (£0.44/100g 
215 
versus £1.14/100g) (Table 4) with costs of GF products significantly higher across all food 
216 
categories (P<0.001). The median cost (pounds per 100g) of GF brown and white bread, 
217 
and white and wholegrain flour was over four times the price of regular equivalents. For 
218 
example, GF white flour cost £0.93/100g whereas regular white flour cost £0.11/100g. The 
219 
range (IQR) of costs was also greater for GF products. 
220 
Prescribed gluten free versus commercial GF food products  
221 
The numbers of prescribed and commercial GF products included in this analysis 
222 
were limited by the small number of products available, i.e. less than 25 in some food 
223 
categories. In eight of the ten food categories, a greater proportion of commercial GF 
224 
foods were categorised as high and medium fat products than their prescribed GF 
225 
counterparts in white bread (89.6% versus 66.7%, respectively, P=0.007), breakfast 
226 
cereals (71.7% versus 33.3%, P=0.018), white flour (45.5% versus 8.0%, P=0.001), and 
227 
wholegrain pasta (55.6% versus 0%, P=0.038) (Table 5).  
228 
Significantly more prescribed GF products were classified as having high and 
229 
medium salt content than commercial equivalents. This trend was seen in breakfast 
230 
cereals (66.7% versus 31.3%, respectively, P=0.032), crackers (100% versus 72.4%, 
231 
P=0.030), and biscuits (100% versus 73.0%, P=0.048) (Table 5), with differences in 
232 
  
10 
medians ranging from 0.1 - 0.3g/100g higher in prescribed GF products (Table 6). White 
233 
pasta was the only food category where the proportion of high and medium salt content of 
234 
products was higher in commercial GF (7.0% versus 5.0% in prescribed GF, P=0.037).  
235 
  
11 
Discussion  
236 
Based on this cross-sectional analysis of GF and regular foods in the UK, statistically 
237 
significant differences in the proportions of products with high and medium content of fat, 
238 
saturated fat, sugar, and salt, and in the content of fibre and protein per 100g were found 
239 
across the ten food categories examined. However a key finding of the present study was 
240 
the lack of a pattern in the comparison of overall nutritional quality of GF and regular 
241 
dietary foods. This finding is consistent with previous studies (15; 16), and supports recent 
242 
evidence suggesting that there is no general nutritional advantage to a GF diet over a 
243 
regular one (32). Furthermore, GF products cost significantly more than comparable regular 
244 
items. 
245 
A similar conclusion was reached by Wu et al. in their survey of supermarket foods in 
246 
Australia (15). Their results differed, however, in that they only found differences in sodium, 
247 
saturated fat, and sugar content in discretionary categories that included biscuits, cake 
248 
mixes, and cereal bars, and not in core food groups. The present study, however, 
249 
observed such differences across all categories, in both the proportions of high and 
250 
medium content (Table 2) and median g/100g (Table 3). Neither of these findings supports 
251 
the popular perception that GF foods offer a healthy alternative to regular products, or can 
252 
aid weight loss (16; 32).  
253 
The content of fat, saturated fat, sugar and salt in foods is of particular interest given 
254 
that these are nutrients that the UK population are likely to consume in excess of 
255 
recommended intake levels (28; 33). In some population groups, habitual intake of more than 
256 
twice the healthy consumption levels has been observed (28). The traffic light classifications 
257 
are voluntary front of pack nutrition labels implemented in response to an agenda set out 
258 
in the Department of Health white paper Choosing Health (34), with an aim to improve 
259 
comprehensibility of nutrition labels (27). Consumers generally spend around four to ten 
260 
  
12 
seconds selecting products, and so the traffic light system has been implemented to 
261 
attempt to convey nutrition information in this short space of time (28).  
262 
Dietary fats are considered under traffic light guidance due to their effect on blood 
263 
cholesterol levels, and potential for contributing to weight gain if consumed in excess (28). 
264 
Though the UK population is meeting recommended guidelines for total fat (35% of total 
265 
energy intake), and intakes have reduced since surveyed nationally in 1986-1987, 
266 
saturated fats are still consumed in excess of recommended amounts (11% of total 
267 
energy) (35; 36).  
268 
Higher fat content of GF foods, in particular GF bread, has been observed previously 
269 
in chemical analyses by Segura and Rosell (9), and in nutritional comparisons conducted in 
270 
Australia and Canada(15; 37), and may be inevitable due to the differing nutritional 
271 
composition of alternative grain ingredients used, or additional fats added in their 
272 
development to optimise consistency of the final product (37; 38). It may therefore be 
273 
possible that the criteria for selection of prescribed GF products are weighted more heavily 
274 
towards lower fat content compared with supermarket-bought GF foods. Although 
275 
prescribed GF products may have fewer proportions of products with high and medium fat 
276 
across numerous food categories the proportion of high and medium saturated fat, sugar 
277 
and salt were still higher than commercial GF foods, meaning they might not necessarily 
278 
be healthier products overall (Table 5).  
279 
Intake of saturated fats in the diet is associated with increased serum cholesterol 
280 
concentration, and reduced consumption of these fats has been associated with a small 
281 
but significant reduction in cardiovascular risk (39). The present study found more GF food 
282 
categories above both high and medium saturated fat thresholds, and median content was 
283 
higher for white flour and bread products, compared to regular equivalents (Table 2), 
284 
although these are not major contributors to the saturated fat intake in the UK diet (40). The 
285 
commercial GF white flour category was notably affected by high saturated fat outliers, 
286 
  
13 
likely to be a result of inclusion of non-wheat alternatives such as almond flour (8g 
287 
saturated fat/100g) and organic coconut flour (14g/100g).  
288 
Coconut-based products in particular have recently been promoted in various media 
289 
as containing ‘healthy’ fats, contrary to evidence of relatively high saturated fat content (38). 
290 
The choice to use coconut flour as a regular cooking ingredient could therefore result in a 
291 
higher consumption of saturated fats than if alternative GF flours were used (for example 
292 
quinoa, sorghum, maize) (38; 41). The presence of these flours as GF ingredients is a 
293 
reflection of the wide variety of alternative flours available in supermarkets, and requires 
294 
consumers to be discerning about their choice of GF flours if wanting low saturated fat 
295 
options.   
296 
Statistically significant differences in the median sugar contents were found in 6 food 
297 
categories. In all 6 categories, the GF products had lower median sugar contents. 
298 
However this should be interpreted with caution as a variable pattern was observed for 
299 
proportions of products in the high and medium sugar classifications in both GF and 
300 
regular products. White bread, white and wholegrain flour, and pizza bases had higher 
301 
proportions of medium and high sugar content in GF products. Yet GF breakfast cereals, 
302 
crackers and biscuits had lower proportions than regular equivalents, and also had lower 
303 
median sugar content. Uniquely, in the white pasta category, GF products were found to 
304 
have a greater proportion above high sugar thresholds but with a lower median, likely to 
305 
indicate to an existence of outliers with high sugar content diverging significantly from that 
306 
of most GF white pasta products.  
307 
The Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition guidelines advise that average intake 
308 
of ‘free sugars’ should not exceed 5% of total dietary energy, to reduce risk of dental 
309 
caries and excess energy consumption (42). However the lack of discernable pattern of 
310 
median sugar content or proportion of high sugar items per category challenges the idea 
311 
that choosing either GF or regular items would increase the consumer’s likelihood of 
312 
  
14 
exceeding this guideline daily threshold. Discerning consumers may instead benefit from 
313 
understanding the food categories more likely to contain high sugar products, and 
314 
choosing products within that category based on a comparison of individual labels. 
315 
Although the sodium derived from salt is an essential nutrient, there is a strong 
316 
association between salt and increased risk of high blood pressure and cardiovascular 
317 
disease (43). Most people in the UK consume around 8g of salt each day, which is in 
318 
excess of the recommended intake level of 6g per day (43; 44). The present study found that 
319 
GF items had higher proportions of high salt products for white flour, wholemeal flour and 
320 
biscuits than regular (Supplementary Table 1) and that significant differences found for salt 
321 
content was more often a result of prescribable GF foods having more high and medium 
322 
salt content foods and higher medians than non-prescribable items (Tables 5 & 6). This 
323 
could mean those on GF diets may be consuming more salt if more of the staple products 
324 
sit within the higher salt classifications. However, estimates from the INTERMAP study 
325 
suggest that over 50% of salt consumed in the UK is sourced from food items not explored 
326 
in the present study (e.g. red meats, vegetable products, dairy and soups)(45). Comparison 
327 
of weighed food records from individuals following GF and non-GF diets would provide 
328 
further insight. 
329 
Fibre content varied depending on the categories examined, with significantly higher 
330 
fibre found in regular white and wholegrain pasta compared to GF equivalents. GF breads 
331 
were significantly higher in fibre than regular products for white and brown breads, but 
332 
lower for breakfast cereals, reflecting the same findings as Wu et al.(15) in Australia. Other 
333 
studies found that no significant difference existed between fibre content of GF and regular 
334 
items across all food categories(18; 46), and that GF breads contained a ‘good’ amount of 
335 
fibre (at least 3g per 100g)(9). This could be a result of manufacturers responding to 
336 
previously published data on deficiencies of fibre in the GF diet(47), and improved texture of 
337 
  
15 
cereal products with the addition of ingredients such an hydrocolloids and inulin, and 
338 
pseudo-cereals such as amaranth, and quinoa(48; 49).  
339 
GF products were found to have significantly lower protein content than regular 
340 
equivalents across nine of ten food categories (the biscuit category the only exception, 
341 
with no significant difference). These findings are consistent with prior research from other 
342 
countries showing lower protein content in GF foods(9; 15; 16; 18), indicating that the removal 
343 
of the gluten protein can impact the overall protein intake from cereal and grain-based 
344 
products. Approximately 23% of dietary protein is obtained from cereals in the UK(50) with 
345 
11% coming from bread indicating that there is potential for a reduction in protein intake 
346 
when wheat-based products are replaced by GF foods. Although this may have little 
347 
clinical importance for those on a GF diet who consume protein from meat, fish, eggs and 
348 
dairy products, those on strict vegan diets (containing no animal proteins) may potentially 
349 
be at more risk of an inadequate protein intake. 
350 
The present study found that GF products were significantly more expensive than 
351 
regular equivalents, as reported previously (19; 20; 37; 51-53).  In the UK, Singh and Whelan 
352 
found that GF versions of wheat-based foods (n=10) cost 76-518% more that regular 
353 
versions (P<0.001) (20); and Burden et al. found that commonly purchased GF foods were 
354 
4.1 times more expensive than regular equivalents (P<0.0001)(19). In Brazil, a significant 
355 
difference in cost between GF and regular products was reported for bread (P<0.01) but 
356 
not for pasta (51).  The difference in cost seems to be particularly disparate in flour and 
357 
bread products due to the high cost of alternative grains to replace wheat (e.g. rice, millet 
358 
and tapioca). Furthermore, expertise is needed to develop GF foods and maintain the 
359 
organoleptic properties associated with the gluten protein, resulting in higher product 
360 
costs. In light of the significantly higher cost of GF foods (159% more expensive than 
361 
regular) and recent reduction or withdrawal of GF prescriptions in some UK NHS Trusts, 
362 
there is risk that individuals with coeliac disease who are not be able to pay higher prices 
363 
  
16 
of GF foods may reduce adherence to their gluten free diet thus compromising their short 
364 
and long-term health. Further studies are required to evaluate this. 
365 
This study has a number of limitations. Firstly, direct chemical analysis of food was 
366 
not undertaken resulting in a reliance on data obtained via manufacturers’ and 
367 
supermarket websites or product packaging. Although indirect analyses have been used 
368 
previously in studies and shown to be a valid method of estimating nutritional composition 
369 
(15-18), reliance on anything other than the ‘gold standard’ direct chemical analysis can 
370 
potentially introduce inaccuracies. Nutrient data on packaging is commonly based on 
371 
manufacturer estimation rather than chemical analysis, and the values provided could not 
372 
be measured for errors in reporting (54).  Secondly, the traffic light system used to classify 
373 
foods does not provide a direct estimate of daily intake for the average consumer of GF or 
374 
regular foods, however these provide some indication of the relative difference between 
375 
the two groups.  Thirdly, the findings of this study focus on statistically significant 
376 
differences of nutrient composition not on actual nutrient intake.  As a result, it is not 
377 
possible to comment on the clinical importance at an individual level.  However, whilst this 
378 
may be small for most individuals, the findings are likely to have greater relevance at 
379 
population level. Strengths of the present analysis include a larger sample size than 
380 
reported previously in the UK, comparison of both nutrients and cost between GF and 
381 
regular foods and, the additional comparison between prescribed and commercially 
382 
available GF items. 
383 
Future research could investigate micronutrient content of GF foods as analysis of 
384 
the intake of 139 adults with coeliac disease and following a GF diet showed that they 
385 
consumed low intakes of magnesium, iron, zinc, manganese, selenium and folate (55). Iron, 
386 
calcium, and vitamin D are also particularly relevant to coeliac disease due to the 
387 
increased risk of anaemia and osteoporosis associated with the condition (10; 56).  
388 
  
17 
Evaluating micronutrient content would require laboratory analysis as legislation does not 
389 
mandate that these are listed in food labels. 
390 
In conclusion, the differences in foods categorised as containing high and medium 
391 
amounts of fat, saturated fat, sugar and salt, and content of fibre and protein found in the 
392 
present study confirm that nutritional composition of GF and regular foods are not the 
393 
same across all food categories. Those people adhering to a strict GF diet might therefore 
394 
be consuming manufactured foods that are at times of lower nutritional quality than the 
395 
regular alternatives, but the lack of a consistent pattern complicates the process of 
396 
drawing conclusions. It is clear however, that the differences observed indicate a need for 
397 
consumers to be discerning in their purchasing behaviour and choose items according to 
398 
the nutritional quality and composition they desire from that product. Policy makers and 
399 
manufacturers who determine the nutritional composition of GF products have an 
400 
important role to play in ensuring that these foods are of comparable nutritional quality to 
401 
the regular products they replace.
