expectancy inequalities in England from 2001 to 2016: 
a population-based analysis of vital registration data

Summary
Background Life expectancy inequalities in England have increased steadily since the 1980s. Our aim was to investigate 
how much deaths from different diseases and injuries and at different ages have contributed to this rise to inform 
policies that aim to reduce health inequalities.
Methods We used vital registration data from the Office for National Statistics on population and deaths in England, 
by underlying cause of death, from 2001 to 2016, stratified by sex, 5-year age group, and decile of the Index of Multiple 
Deprivation (based on the ranked scores of Lower Super Output Areas in England in 2015). We grouped the 
7·65 million deaths by their assigned International Classification of Diseases (10th revision) codes to create categories 
of public health and clinical relevance. We used a Bayesian hierarchical model to obtain robust estimates of cause-
specific death rates by sex, age group, year, and deprivation decile. We calculated life expectancy at birth by decile of 
deprivation and year using life-table methods. We calculated the contributions of deaths from each disease and injury, 
in each 5-year age group, to the life expectancy gap between the most deprived and affluent deciles using Arriaga’s 
method.
Findings The life expectancy gap between the most affluent and most deprived deciles increased from 6·1 years 
(95% credible interval 5·9–6·2) in 2001 to 7·9 years (7·7–8·1) in 2016 in females and from 9·0 years (8·8–9·2) to 
9·7 years (9·6–9·9) in males. Since 2011, the rise in female life expectancy has stalled in the third, fourth, and fifth 
most deprived deciles and has reversed in the two most deprived deciles, declining by 0·24 years (0·10–0·37) in the 
most deprived and 0·16 years (0·02–0·29) in the second-most deprived by 2016. Death rates from every disease and 
at every age were higher in deprived areas than in affluent ones in 2016. The largest contributors to life expectancy 
inequalities were deaths in children younger than 5 years (mostly neonatal deaths), respiratory diseases, ischaemic 
heart disease, and lung and digestive cancers in working ages, and dementias in older ages. From 2001 to 2016, the 
contributions to inequalities declined for deaths in children younger than 5 years, ischaemic heart disease (for both 
sexes), and stroke and intentional injuries (for men), but increased for most other causes.
Interpretation Recent trends in life expectancy in England have not only resulted in widened inequalities but the most 
deprived communities are now seeing no life expectancy gain. These inequalities are driven by a diverse group of 
diseases that can be effectively prevented and treated. Adoption of the principle of proportionate universalism to 
prevention and health and social care can postpone deaths into older ages for all communities and reduce life 
expectancy inequalities.

Introduction
Life expectancy inequality between affluent and deprived 
communities has increased steadily in England since 
the 1980s.1,2 Health inequalities can be tackled through 
progressive economic and social policies; public health 
interventions that reduce inequalities in environmental, 
nutritional, and behavioural risks; and preventive and 
life-saving treatments to delay the onset of disease or 
death in disadvantaged groups.3
Some of these options, such as cancer screening, affect 
specific diseases. Others, such as policies that reduce 
poverty and social inequalities and investments in health 
and social care, influence the occurrence and outcomes 
of many diseases. Information on the contribution of 
deaths from different diseases and injuries, and at 
different ages, to life expectancy inequalities is needed to 
envision how each intervention and policy option affects 
not only aggregate health outcomes but also health 
inequalities. Studying how these contributions have 
changed over time can indicate which diseases and 
injuries are driving the widening health inequalities, and 
thereby helps policy makers and civil society to make 
specific recommendations for improving health.
Although life expectancy inequalities in England have 
been documented, there is little information on how 
much deaths from specific diseases and at different

ages contribute to these inequalities4,5 and how these 
contributions have changed. We used national statistics 
data on deaths by age group and underlying cause of 
death to estimate their respective contributions to life 
expectancy inequalities in England from 2001 to 2016.
Methods
Data sources
We obtained yearly data from the Office for National 
Statistics on population and all deaths, by underlying 
cause of death, from 2001 to 2016 in England. We started 
the analysis from 2001 because the change from 
the International Classification of Diseases (ICD), 
9th revision, to ICD-10 in that year affects death counts 
for some causes of death, and hence restricts comparisons 
over time. The underlying causes of death were divided 
into categories on the basis of their assigned ICD-10 
codes (appendix p 15). These categories were selected 
because of their public health and clinical relevance in 
terms of interventions and to ensure cause groups 
contained a sufficient number of deaths to allow robust 
estimates.
We included data on all 7·65 million deaths recorded 
in 2001–16 in our analyses, which were stratified by sex, 
5-year age group, and decile of the Index of Multiple 
Deprivation (IMD). The IMD is the official measure of 
deprivation in England and is based on multiple 
indicators of individual and community welfare and 
wellbeing. Data were grouped into deciles of deprivation 
based on the ranked IMD scores of Lower Super Output 
Areas (LSOAs) in England in 2015; England is divided 
into 32 844 LSOAs, with a median LSOA population in 
2015 of 1597 people. Decile 1 corresponds to the most 
deprived 10% of LSOAs (n=3284) and decile 10 to the 
most affluent 10% (n=3285). The most deprived LSOAs 
were mostly in urban areas, especially those in north 
and northeast England and the West Midlands—eg, 
Birmingham, Bradford, Leeds, Liverpool, Manchester, 
and Newcastle (appendix p 5). They were more frequently 
classified as urban conurbations than were the most 
affluent LSOAs (1936 [59%] of LSOAs in decile 1 vs 766 
[23%] of LSOAs in decile 10), whereas the most affluent 
LSOAs were mostly in smaller cities and urban towns 
(1902 [58%]).
We used the same decile grouping throughout 
the study period for two reasons. First, consistent 
classification of LSOAs allows tracking of changes in 
death rates and life expectancy over time in consistent 
groups of LSOAs. Second, the IMD was calculated by the 
Office for National Statistics only for the years 2004, 
2007, 2010, and 2015, which makes it impossible to use 
year-specific deciles. There was very high correlation 
(r = 0·95) between LSOA IMD ranks in 2004 and in 2015, 
with 89% of LSOAs (28 187 of the 31 726 LSOAs with 
consistent boundaries over time) being assigned to a 
decile in 2015 that was within one decile of that of 2004,

Research in context
Evidence before this study
We searched PubMed for articles published from inception up 
to Aug 14, 2018, with search terms “life expectancy” AND 
“inequality” AND (“trend” OR “decomposition”) AND 
(“England” or “United Kingdom”) for papers that had analysed 
life expectancy inequalities in England or the UK and the 
contributions of deaths at different ages and from different 
diseases and injuries to these inequalities, with no language 
restrictions. We also searched for reports on health inequalities 
through the websites of the Office for National Statistics and 
Public Health England. We found several articles and reports on 
life expectancy inequalities in England at one point in time and 
two articles on trends in life expectancy inequalities. We found 
two consecutive annual reports that quantified separately the 
contributions of deaths at different ages and from different 
diseases and injuries to the life expectancy difference between 
the top and bottom deciles of deprivation at one point in time, 
but none that had done so over time nor that considered the 
combination of disease and age groups.
Added value of this study
To our knowledge, this Article shows for the first time how 
deaths at different ages and from different diseases contribute 
to the life expectancy inequality between deprived and affluent 
groups in England, and how these contributions have changed 
as the extent of inequality has increased. We used a Bayesian 
statistical model so that our estimates of life expectancy 
inequality, and of contributions of deaths by age group and 
disease or injury to these inequalities, were robust to small 
numbers of deaths in some age groups and diseases.
Implications of all the available evidence
Life expectancy inequality between deprived and affluent areas of 
England has increased since 2001. Currently, the main 
contributors to life expectancy inequality are deaths in children 
younger than 5 years, respiratory diseases, ischaemic heart disease, 
lung and digestive cancers in working ages, and dementias in older 
ages. Over time, the contributions of deaths in children younger 
than 5 years, ischaemic heart disease and stroke (for both sexes), 
and intentional injuries (for men) to inequalities have declined but 
those of most other disease groups have increased. The diversity 
of diseases that contribute to life expectancy inequalities 
demonstrates the need for policies that address poverty and social 
inequalities coupled with investment in the National Health 
Service to improve high-quality primary and specialist care for 
deprived groups and communities under the principle of 
proportionate universalism. Specific public health and clinical 
interventions—for example, fiscal and regulatory measures to 
reduce alcohol and tobacco use and technology for early 
diagnosis—might also help to reduce inequalities in life 
expectancy if targeted towards deprived communities and social 
groups.

and 99% (31 290 of 31 726) within two deciles. In other 
words, deprivation and affluence persist over time in 
England.
Statistical methods
Division by sex, age group, decile of deprivation, and 
underlying cause of death can result in few deaths in 
some units, leading to highly variable estimates of death 
rates. To overcome this issue, we used a Bayesian 
hierarchical model to obtain estimates of death rates by 
sharing information across age groups and deprivation 
deciles and over time. In this approach, death rates for 
each age group, deprivation decile, and year are informed 
by data in that age group-deprivation-year unit as well as 
by those in the adjacent age groups, adjacent years, and 
adjacent deprivation deciles. The extent to which the 
estimated death rates are influenced by adjacent units 
depended on the number of deaths, with larger groups 
and those with higher death rates (eg, ischaemic heart 
disease in older ages) being largely informed by their 
own data and smaller groups with lower death rates 
(eg, some chronic diseases in young children) being 
influenced by the combination of their own data and data 
in other units.
The model was formulated to take into account how 
death rates vary in relation to age, time, and deprivation 
(appendix p 2). Specifically, we allowed each age group to 
have a different level (ie, intercept) and trend (ie, slope) 
in log-transformed death rate, and modelled age-group 
intercepts and slopes with a random-walk structure that 
is widely used to characterise smoothly varying age 
associations. This approach improves robustness of 
death rates in each age group and avoids implausible age 
patterns of mortality that could occur if each age group 
were analysed separately. We included similar terms and 
random-walk structures to describe the levels and trends 
of death rates in each deprivation decile. We also included 
age-deprivation interaction terms for both death rate 
level and trend. These terms allow the association of 
death rates with deprivation to vary by age group and, 
equivalently, each deprivation decile is able to have a 
different age pattern of mortality. Finally, because time 
trends in death rates can be non-linear, we modelled time 
trends of death rates using a linear term plus a smoothly 
varying non-linear term specified via a random walk. 
Detailed model specification is provided in the appendix 
and our statistical code can be downloaded online. All 
analyses were done separately by sex and for each cause 
of death because mortality levels and trends differ by sex 
and cause.
Age-standardised death rates were calculated using the 
age distribution of the combined female and male 
population of England in 2016. We calculated life 
expectancy at birth by decile of deprivation using life-
table methods. We used the Kannisto-Thatcher method6 
to expand the terminal age group (≥85 years) of the life 
table. We evaluated the performance of the model using 
the difference between life expectancies calculated from 
the observed death rates and those from the Bayesian 
hierarchical model. The median difference between 
observed and modelled life expectancy estimates across 
deprivation deciles and years was less than 0·001 years 
for females and for males and the median absolute 
differences were 0·045 years for females and 0·050 years 
for males; these differences remained similar across 
deprivation deciles and over time.
We calculated the contributions of deaths from each 
disease and injury, in each 5-year age group, to the life 
expectancy gap between the most deprived and affluent 
deciles using Arriaga’s method, which is widely used 
to decompose life expectancy differences between pop-
ulations or population subgroups.7 Arriaga’s method 
calculates how much each age group contributes to the 
life expectancy gap by summing how much death rate 
differences at that age change the years of life lived both 
at that age and in subsequent ages through changing the 
number of survivors. It then uses information on how 
much each cause of death contributes to the differences 
in death rates between the deprived and affluent deciles 
to partition the age-specific contributions to the life 
expectancy gap by disease and injury.
All models were fitted using the R software

Results
Life expectancy at birth in 2016 was consistently lower in 
more deprived communities, ranging from 78·8 years 
(95% credible interval 78·7–78·9) in the most deprived 
LSOAs to 86·7 years (86·6–86·8) in the most affluent 
ones for females and from 74·0 years (73·9–74·1) to 
83·8 years (83·6–83·9) for males (figure 1). From decile 9 
to decile 5, life expectancy dropped by about 6 months 
between adjacent deciles for both sexes (figure 1). 
However, the differences in life expectancy between 
deciles increased markedly both from decile 9 to decile 10, 
and for those below decile 5. At the extreme, the most 
deprived LSOAs were particularly badly off, with life 
expectancy lagging behind those of the next worst-off
 
decile by 1·5 years (1·4–1·7) for females and 2·2 years 
(2·0–2·3) for males—a larger gap than between other 
adjacent deciles for both sexes. 
Although life expectancy increased in every deprivation 
decile from 2001 to 2016, gains were larger in the better-
off groups: 1·6 years (1·4–1·8) in the most deprived 
females compared with 3·4 years (3·2–3·5) in the least

deprived females and 3·2 years (3·0–3·4) in the most 
deprived males compared with 3·9 years (3·7–4·1) in the 
least deprived males. As a result, the life expectancy gap 
between the most affluent and most deprived deciles 
increased from 6·1 years (5·9–6·2) in 2001 to 7·9 years 
(7·7–8·1) in 2016 in females and from 9·0 years (8·8–9·2) 
to 9·7 years (9·6–9·9) in males (figure 1). Since 2011, the 
rise in female life expectancy has reversed in the two 
most deprived deciles, declining by 0·24 years (0·10–0·37) 
in the most deprived and 0·16 years (0·02–0·29) in the 
second-most deprived by 2016, and has stalled in the 
third, fourth, and fifth most deprived deciles but has 
continued in better-off deciles with increases of up to 
0·38 years in the more affluent deciles (appendix pp 7, 18).
Age-standardised death rates from all diseases and 
injuries were higher in the more deprived groups in 
most years, with death rates consistently increasing with 
deprivation for most diseases; the exceptions were 
haematological, breast, and prostate cancers in which 
we observed a slight reordering of death rates in 
comparison with deprivation (figure 2). Beyond the over-
all socioeconomic gradient, the most and sometimes 
second-most deprived groups stood separated from other 
groups in terms of having a higher age-standardised 
death rate for liver, digestive, and lung cancers; 
respiratory diseases; diabetes; intentional and un-
intentional injuries; and for a heterogeneous set of 
other causes of death. Absolute inequality (ie, difference) 
between the most and least deprived groups in 2016 was 
larger for diseases with higher age-standardised death 
rates—ie, ischaemic heart disease, respiratory diseases, 
lung cancer, and dementias. Relative inequality (ie, ratio) 
was largest for lung cancer, diabetes, and respiratory 
diseases, ranging from 2·5 to 3·3 in the two sexes; it was 
smallest for prostate, breast, and haematological cancers, 
with relative inequalities all at 1·1 (appendix p 20).
From 2001 to 2016, age-standardised death rates from 
most diseases declined, except for liver cancer and 
dementias for which death rates increased in every 
deprivation decile. Death rates from both intentional 
and unintentional injuries also increased after 2010 
(with posterior probabilities greater than 0·80 of these 
recent increases being a true increase in all but two 
[intentional injuries] or three [unintentional injuries] of 
the 20 sex–deprivation decile combinations). Over the 
16 years of analysis, absolute inequalities between the 
most and least deprived deciles increased for all diseases 
and injuries except ischaemic heart disease, intentional 
injuries, and the cluster of all other cancers in both sexes 
and stroke, lung cancer, and digestive cancers for men.
For both females and males, 4% of the life expectancy 
gaps (0·3 of 7·9 years for females and 0·4 of 9·7 years for 
males) between the most affluent and most deprived 
groups in 2016 were due to differences in under-5 
mortality, with about two-thirds of deaths in this age group 
occurring during the neonatal period. 6% (0·5 years) of 
the female gap and 10% (1·0 years) of the male gap were 
due to differences in those aged 5–39 years and 46% 
(3·6 years) of the female gap and 55% (5·3 years) of the 
male gap were due to differences in those aged 40–70 years; 
the remainder was due to differences among those aged 
70 years and older (figure 3; appendix p 9). In addition to 
deaths of children younger than 5 years, major disease 
and injury contributors to social inequalities in life 
expectancy for both sexes were lung and digestive cancers 
(together contributing 1·2 years for females and 1·4 years 
for males), respiratory diseases (1·6 years and 1·5 years), 
ischaemic heart disease (0·8 years and 1·5 years), and 
dementias (0·5 years and 0·3 years, mostly above 70 years 
of age). Injuries also contributed to 0·2 years of the life 
expectancy gap between the most affluent and most 
deprived deciles in females and 0·6 years of the gap in 
males. No disease or injury had a negative contribution to 
inequalities at any age because death rates from every 
disease and injury were higher in the most deprived group 
than in the most affluent group at every age (figure 3).
Although deaths in children younger than 5 years were 
a major contributor to life expectancy inequalities, their 
contribution declined from 2001 to 2016 from 0·5 years 
to 0·3 years for females and from 0·6 to 0·4 years for 
males (figure 4; appendix p 12) as absolute inequalities in 
under-5 mortality decreased. Both sexes experienced 
large declines in the contributions to life expectancy 
inequalities of ischaemic heart disease and, to a lesser 
extent, stroke, whereas men saw a large decline in the 
contribution of intentional injuries. The contributions of 
respiratory diseases, cancers, and dementias to the life 
expectancy gap between the affluent and deprived groups 
increased (figure 4; appendix p 12). The cancers whose 
contributions increased the most were liver and other 
digestive cancers for both sexes and lung and breast 
cancer for women. For men, the contributions of lung 
cancer to life expectancy inequalities fell below 65 years 
of age but increased in older ages, resulting in a net 
increase of about 0·1 years.
Discussion
In this analysis of vital registration data from 2001 to 
2016, we found that life expectancy increased for every 
decile of deprivation but the inequality between the 
deprived and affluent deciles grew larger. Importantly, 
since 2011, the rise in female life expectancy has reversed 
in the two most deprived deciles and stalled in the third, 
fourth, and fifth most deprived deciles, indicating that 
the poor are being entirely left out of the beneficial 
overall trends in life expectancy. The gap in female life 
expectancy between the most affluent and most deprived 
deciles of LSOAs is about the same as the difference 
between the UK’s life expectancy as a whole (83·2 years) 
and that of Libya (75·0 years) or Azerbaijan (75·7 years), 
whereas the gap in male life expectancy is about the 
same as the difference between that of the UK as a whole 
(79·7 years) and that of Guatemala (70·4 years) or 
Azerbaijan (70·3 years).8 In 2016, the largest contributors

to life expectancy inequalities between deprived and 
affluent areas of England were deaths in children 
younger than 5 years, dementias in older ages, and 
respiratory diseases, ischaemic heart disease, and a set of 
preventable and treatable cancers in working ages.
Our findings on rising inequalities in life expectancy 
in England are consistent with previous studies.1,2 
Similarly, our findings on inequalities in death rates and 
their trends are consistent with the few existing studies 
on specific diseases, such as cardiovascular diseases9,10 
and neonatal mortality.11 To our knowledge, only two 
consecutive annual reports4,5 calculated the contribution 
of deaths from different age groups and from 11 broad 
clusters of diseases to life expectancy inequalities at one 
point in time, but they did not consider the changes in 
contributions over time nor the combination of disease 
and age groups. The large contributions of circulatory 
and respiratory diseases and cancers to the gap in life 
expectancy between the most and least deprived areas in 
those reports were consistent with our findings.

A strength of our study is that we report how clinically 
relevant causes of death at different ages contribute to 
current, and rising, life expectancy inequalities. We used 
a Bayesian model to robustly estimate death rates for 
different diseases by age group and deprivation decile. 
We grouped LSOAs by decile of IMD in 2015, which has 
the advantage of tracking the same groups of LSOAs over 
time but has the limitation of not reflecting historical 
inequalities if some LSOAs have switched deciles. 
Nonetheless, the rankings of LSOA IMD in 2015 were 
highly correlated with those in 2004 and few LSOAs 
moved by more than one decile between these years. 
Furthermore, the population of each LSOA might change 
because of migration, both within the country and 
overseas.12 Therefore, life expectancy trends should not be 
attributed solely to changes in health status of individuals. 
Studies in the UK12,13 have shown that migration alone 
does not explain trends in health and health inequalities 
and that these trends represent real changes in population 
health. Even if rising inequalities are partly due to

migration (often by healthy people) from one area to 
another, such migration patterns have social and eco-
nomic roots that should be addressed through employ-
ment opportunities, affordable housing, and high-quality 
education and health care. Finally, even though LSOAs 
have small populations, there are inevitably variations in 
socioeconomic status and health within them. From the 
perspective of inter 
ventions, this heterogeneity means 
that there is a need for inter 
ventions based on individual 
attributes (eg, social benefits or targeted financial 
incentives for healthy foods) as well as those that address 
communities (eg, more equitable provision of primary 
and specialist care), as we discuss below.
Policies in the 1970s and 1980s that reduced job security, 
increased unemployment, and worsened income in-
equalities in the UK were important determinants of 
rising health inequalities in subsequent decades.14 
Today, once again, despite historic low levels of formal 
unemployment, working incomes have stagnated for the 
poorest15 and the new gig economy has diminished job 
security.16 Low-wage employment, coupled with un-
precedented cuts to in-work and out-of-work benefits,17 
has contributed to 1·5 million people experiencing 
destitution,18 with particularly large effects in children 
and people of working age in already disadvantaged 
groups.19–25 As described in the The New York Times, “after 
eight years of budget cutting, Britain is looking less like 
the rest of Europe and more like the United States, with a 
shrinking welfare state and spreading poverty”.26
Smoking, alcohol use, and poor nutrition, which all 
have substantial social inequalities, are important causes 
of some of the diseases with the largest contributions to 
life expectancy inequalities. Given the social inequalities 
associated with these risk factors, some public health 
efforts addressing them might have inadvertently 
worsened inequalities even if in some cases, such as 
smoking, they have helped to reduce mortality for all 
social groups, including the most deprived. In particular, 
social inequalities in smoking have increased as aggregate 
prevalence has declined,4 especially for smoking during 
pregnancy, which has a more than ten-fold variation in 
prevalence among English local authorities.27 Substantial 
reductions in local authority smoking cessation budgets 
risk worsening these inequalities.
Fiscal and regulatory measures tend to be more effective 
at achieving behavioural change and reducing inequalities 
than voluntary approaches.28 For example, the UK’s 
regulatory approach to salt reformulation under the Food 
Standards Agency’s leadership achieved a 15% reduction 
in salt consumption up to 2010 through enforce 
ment of 
targets to reduce salt content in processed foods. By 
contrast, the voluntary and self-policing approach of the 
failed Public Health Responsibility Deal (which has since 
been abandoned) stalled this progress from 2010 
onwards.29 Given these experiences, the UK should 
embrace fiscal and regulatory policies for alcohol and 
foods rich in sugar, salt, and trans fats. Finally, and 
importantly, the cost of healthy foods, especially fresh 
fruits and vegetables, has increased in the UK and other 
high-income countries30 relative to unhealthy processed 
foods. Coupled with the rising number of families on 
benefits and working families needing to use foodbanks 
because their income does not cover the cost of 
essentials,31 substantial improvements in diet require 
making healthier foods affordable to poor families 
through targeted financial mechanisms.32
Finally, our finding that death rates from every disease 
and at every age were higher in deprived areas than in 
affluent ones means that access to and utilisation of 
high-quality health care is an essential component of 
strategies for reducing life expectancy inequalities. For 
example, more equitable treatment of acute coronary 
events and secondary prevention in survivors33 are likely 
to have contributed to declining absolute inequalities 
in ischaemic heart disease mortality.
The potential of universal high-quality health care to 
reduce health inequalities is undermined by unequal 
provision of health care and unequal opportunities for its 
utilisation, leading to worse survival in deprived groups 
compared with affluent ones. For example, patients from 
deprived areas have a later cancer diagnosis and worse 
survival than their more affluent counterparts.34
Three components of health and social care are 
particularly relevant for reducing inequalities under the 
principle of proportionate universalism: access to health 
care; health promotion and disease prevention through 
risk prediction and early diagnosis; and strengthening 
integrated health and social care. First, although universal 
access is a pillar of the UK National Health Service (NHS), 
in practice services are not equally accessible due to how 
they are provided and used. In terms of provision, 
previous efforts to reduce inequalities have had some 
success in increasing physician numbers in specific 
deprived areas.35 However, health and social care is now 
more stretched than ever before, owing to a lengthy 
period of below-average annual funding increases 
since 2010 (1·0% for health compared with a long-term 
average of 3·9%). The funding squeeze, a growing and 
ageing population, and workforce shortages have 
worsened wait times for primary and specialist care, 
especially in deprived areas.33,36 Unequal utilisation of 
services is multifaceted but limited accessibility outside 
of working hours coupled with little or no flexibility in 
terms of work hours or schedule37 and transport cost and 
time are important obstacles to use in deprived groups. 
Screening programmes such as the NHS Health Check 
are effective at identifying those at high risk of adverse 
health events for some of the diseases with large 
contri 
butions to life expectancy inequalities. Screening, 
although beneficial for all social groups, risks worsening 
inequalities if it differentially benefits more affluent 
groups. Making screening more equitable is partly related 
to health-care access and utilisation, as discussed above. 
Novel point-of-care technologies, such as those for cancer

detection,38 have the potential to move screening from 
clinic and laboratory into homes and communities. 
However, equity must be integral to the rollout of new 
diagnostic technologies to avoid exacerbating existing 
inequalities through a two-tier system of access and 
utilisation.
Finally, curbing and reversing the worsening in-
equalities in chronic conditions such as dementia 
requires enhancement and better integration of health 
and social care. This objective is not only hindered but 
also set back by the substantial cuts to local authority 
budgets over the past 8 years, resulting in worse 
outcomes for the more deprived groups compared with 
those able to pay for better care.39,40
To reduce health inequalities, sustained and co 
ordinated 
action is needed across the three areas of economic and 
social determinants, risk behaviours and environments, 
and health and social care.3,35 The UK now faces a perfect 
storm of obstacles to reducing health inequalities, with all 
three areas simultaneously in a condition of policy 
stagnation and regression. A positive tide might be 
emerging, however, as, after decades of being treated as 
secondary to aggregate improvements in the economy 
and health, inequalities are emerging as the central issue 
in policy and political debates in the UK and other high-
income countries. Pressured by the public, civil society 
organ 
isations, and philanthropists, political parties—
while differing massively in their ideology and 
responses—are acknowledging inequalities as a key social 
challenge and promising policy responses. Health equity 
in all policies should become a key aim of these responses.
