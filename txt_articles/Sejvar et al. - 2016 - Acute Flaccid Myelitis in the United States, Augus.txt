Background.
During late summer/fall 2014, pediatric cases of acute flaccid myelitis (AFM) occurred in the United States, co-
incident with a national outbreak of enterovirus D68 (EV-D68)–associated severe respiratory illness.
Methods.
Clinicians and health departments reported standardized clinical, epidemiologic, and radiologic information on AFM
cases to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and submitted biological samples for testing. Cases were ≤21 years
old, with acute onset of limb weakness 1 August–31 December 2014 and spinal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showing lesions
predominantly restricted to gray matter.
Results.
From August through December 2014, 120 AFM cases were reported from 34 states. Median age was 7.1 years (inter-
quartile range, 4.8–12.1 years); 59% were male. Most experienced respiratory (81%) or febrile (64%) illness before limb weakness
onset. MRI abnormalities were predominantly in the cervical spinal cord (103/118). All but 1 case was hospitalized; none died. Ce-
rebrospinal fluid (CSF) pleocytosis (>5 white blood cells/µL) was common (81%). At CDC, 1 CSF specimen was positive for EV-D68
and Epstein-Barr virus by real-time polymerase chain reaction, although the specimen had >3000 red blood cells/µL. The most com-
mon virus detected in upper respiratory tract specimens was EV-D68 (from 20%, and 47% with specimen collected ≤7 days from
respiratory illness/fever onset). Continued surveillance in 2015 identified 16 AFM cases reported from 13 states.
Conclusions.
Epidemiologic data suggest this AFM cluster was likely associated with the large outbreak of EV-D68–associated
respiratory illness, although direct laboratory evidence linking AFM with EV-D68 remains inconclusive. Continued surveillance will
help define the incidence, epidemiology, and etiology of AFM.

Since the widespread implementation of polio vaccination start-
ing in the 1950s, acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) due to poliovirus
has been eliminated from most countries [1,2].AFP attributable
to spinal cord/anterior horn cell involvement (“nonpoliovirus”
anterior myelitis) is thought to occur infrequently, but various
nonpolio enteroviruses (eg, enterovirus A71, coxsackie viruses
A and B), and other viruses (eg, flaviviruses, herpesviruses,
and adenoviruses), have occasionally been reported as etiologies
[3–5]. AFP incidence in the United States population <15 years
of age is estimated at around 1.4 cases per 100 000 per year [6];
however, systematic surveillance for AFP, specifically with
anterior horn cell involvement, is not conducted in the United
States.
A report at an April 2014 national US neurology meeting of
children in California with a “polio-like” illness generated sub-
stantial media attention [7]. In August 2014, physicians at
Children’s Hospital Colorado, in Aurora, Colorado, noted an
unusual clustering of children with acute limb weakness similar
to that described in California [8–11]. Most patients had dis-
tinctive abnormalities of the central spinal cord on magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI), with gray matter lesions in both an-
terior and posterior segments of the cord extending multiple
levels [12]. Based on these clinical and anatomic characteristics,
the illness was referred to as acute flaccid myelitis (AFM), to dis-
tinguish it from other forms of AFP [9].The etiology of the Col-
orado cases was unclear, although there was a strong temporal
association with an increase in severe respiratory disease caused
by enterovirus D68 (EV-D68) in Colorado [13]. On 26 Septem-
ber 2014, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC) issued a health advisory requesting state and local health
departments to report retrospective and prospective AFM cases

 and send specimens to CDC for testing (http://emergency.cdc.
gov/han/han00370.asp). Here, we summarize the epidemiolog-
ic, clinical, and laboratory findings of the AFM investigation.
METHODS
Case Information
We defined a case as any person aged ≤21 years, with acute
onset of limb weakness starting on or after 1 August 2014,
and with a spinal MRI revealing lesions predominantly of the
gray matter. Patients with spinal cord trauma or an otherwise
known etiology of limb weakness were excluded. Clinicians or
public health officials were requested to complete and submit a
standardized case report form (CRF) (http://www.cdc.gov/
acute-flaccid-myelitis/downloads/patient-summary-form.pdf)
including information on patient demographics, symptoms
(including respiratory illness or documented fever >100.4°F
(38°C) during the 4 weeks before limb weakness onset), clinical
presentation, MRI findings, test results from local laboratories,
and disposition. We present data for cases with onset through
31 December 2014. Denominators vary due to missing data
for some questions.
MRI Review
All CRFs were reviewed by 1 of 2 neurologists (D. M. P., J. J. S.);
if MRI findings as reported on the CRF were ambiguous, a copy
of the MRI report was requested. If MRI findings remained un-
clear after review of the report, the MRI images were requested
and reviewed by one of the study neurologists.
Laboratory Testing
Specimens sent to the CDC included cerebrospinal fluid (CSF),
serum (acute and convalescent were requested), respiratory
samples (nasopharyngeal swab, nasopharyngeal aspirate, oro-
pharyngeal swab, or oral swab), and stool (2 stool specimens
collected >24 hours apart, per poliovirus testing protocol)
[14]. A diagnostic algorithm was established to test for the fol-
lowing pathogens: enteroviruses (enterovirus-specific real-time
reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction [rRT-PCR])
[15]), EV-D68–specific real-time RT-PCR (http://www.fda.
gov/MedicalDevices/Safety/EmergencySituations/ucm161496.
htm) and enterovirus typing by VP1 seminested PCR and se-
quencing [16]; arboviruses (West Nile virus [immunoglobulin
M {IgM} antibody in CSF or serum by IgM-capture enzyme-
linked immunosorbent assay {MAC-ELISA}], St Louis enceph-
alitis [IgM antibody in serum by microsphere immunoassay],
and LaCrosse viruses [IgM antibody in serum by MAC-ELISA]);
herpesviruses (including human herpesviruses 1 and 2, varicella
zoster virus, and Epstein-Barr virus by fluorescence resonance
energy transfer real-time PCR [FRET-rPCR], human herpesvi-
rus 6A and 6B by conventional rPCR, and cytomegalovirus by
TaqMan rPCR); and adenoviruses by rPCR. Expanded viral
testing, including a panel of family/genus taxon-specific viral
PCR assays and sequencing utilizing generic primers for 12
viral families and metagenomic next-generation sequencing,
was conducted on a subset of cases with specimens collected
early in the illness. (Full protocols for these CDC in-house
PCR and serologic methods are available upon request.) Further
screening with electron microscopy was conducted on a conve-
nience sample of 6 CSF specimens.
Respiratory Illness Data
Data on respiratory tract specimens testing positive at CDC for
EV-D68 were obtained from passive national surveillance [13].
We also examined respiratory illness data from BioSense, a
timely, national electronic health information system operated
by CDC and used for syndromic surveillance [17, 18]. We used
emergency department visits in which dyspnea was diagnosed
in persons aged <18 years as a syndromic indicator for when
peak EV-D68 circulation occurred nationally in August–October
2014 [13].
Descriptive analyses were performed using SAS version 9.3
software (SAS Institute, Cary, North Carolina). The investiga-
tion was determined to be nonresearch public health response
by the CDC Human Subjects Review board.
RESULTS
The CDC received 120 case reports meeting AFM case defini-
tion with onset 1 August–31 December 2014 (Figure 1; Supple-
mentary Figure 1). During the 5-month period, the crude
nationwide AFM incidence among persons ≤21 years was
0.026 cases per 100 000 population per month (0.32 cases/
100 000 population/year if this monthly rate applied for 12
months). Cases were reported from 34 states (Figure 2). Median
age was 7.1 years (range, 0.4–20.8 years; interquartile range
[IQR], 4.8–12.1 years); 71 (59%) were male (Table 1; Supple-
mentary Figure 2). Of 114 patients with information on preced-
ing respiratory illness and fever, 64 (56%) had both fever and
respiratory symptoms before limb weakness onset, 28 (25%) ex-
perienced only respiratory illness, 10 (9%) experienced only fe-
brile illness, and 12 (11%) experienced neither. Median interval
between respiratory or febrile illness onset (whichever occurred
first) and limb weakness was 5 days (range, 0–18 days; IQR, 3–9
days).
All but 1 patient was hospitalized (Table 1). Twenty percent
of patients required mechanical ventilation for neuromuscular
respiratory failure. Thirty-four percent had only upper extrem-
ity involvement, 23% had only lower extremity involvement,
and 43% had both upper and lower extremities involved.
Limb weakness was distinctly asymmetrical in 47%, and 30%
had weakness restricted to 1 limb. Eighty-one percent had de-
creased or absent deep-tendon reflexes. Twenty-four percent re-
ported numbness in affected limbs, while 51% reported pain.
Cranial nerve dysfunction was evident in 28%, including facial
weakness (14%), dysphagia (12%), and diplopia (9%). Signs
suggesting cerebral involvement were largely absent, with only

 11% demonstrating altered mental status, and 4% with seizures.
Twenty-one percent with available information reported an un-
derlying medical condition prior to onset of neurologic illness;
the most frequently reported condition was asthma (12/116
[10%]); and 2 patients had an immunosuppressive illness (car-
diac transplant and diabetes mellitus type 1).

hospitals that contributed consistently during August–October 2014. BioSense hospitals may be different from the hospitals that reported AFM cases. C, First public health com-
munication informing states that CDC was available to test respiratory specimens for EV-D68 was on 28 August 2014. On 25 September 2014, CDC communications stated that CDC
testing would be prioritized to samples from children with severe respiratory disease. Over time, more state laboratories developed capacity to test their samples.

 Treatment and Outcomes
Eighty-five of 98 (87%) patients with any treatment informa-
tion received some type of immunomodulating therapy for
the neurologic illness, including intravenous immunoglobulin
(62/85 [73%]), corticosteroids (46 [54%]), plasma exchange
(13 [15%]), or other immunosuppressive medication (2 [2%]).
We received follow-up information from caregivers on the clin-
ical status of 56 (47%) patients, who reported on function (effect
of limb weakness on daily living activities) and limb strength
(Table 1). Median interval between limb weakness onset and re-
port of follow-up outcome was 4.2 months (range, 0.8–7.5
months; IQR, 2.8–5.4 months). Of the 56 respondents, 8 pa-
tients (14%) were reported as completely dependent on caregiv-
ers, 38 (68%) had some degree of functional impairment,
requiring assistance for some activities, and 10 (18%) reported
being fully functional. Only 3 patients (5%) reported complete
recovery of strength; the remainder had some residual weak-
ness. There were no deaths.
MRI Findings
Although the entire spinal cord was not imaged in all patients
and not all reports included details on each level, the most com-
mon site of involvement was the cervical spinal cord (103/118
[87%]), followed by thoracic (80/100 [80%]) and conus medul-
laris/cauda equina (36/76 [47%]) (Table 2). Spinal cord paren-
chymal gadolinium enhancement was seen in 22 of 103 (21%)
patients to whom gadolinium was administered, and ventral
nerve root enhancement was visualized in 16 of 47 (34%) pa-
tients with MRI imaging of the cauda equina and were admin-
istered gadolinium. Ninety-seven of 101 (96%) patients whose
report included the affected spinal cord levels had >1 spinal seg-
ment involved.
CSF Characteristics
One hundred twelve patients had CSF parameters reported. The
median interval between limb weakness onset and CSF collec-
tion was 2 days (range, 0–42 days; IQR, 1–3 days); another 5
patients had CSF collected before their limb weakness onset.
Median CSF white blood cell (WBC) count was 44 cells/µL
(range, 0–664 cells/µL; IQR, 12–93 cells/µL; Supplementary
Table 1). CSF pleocytosis, defined as WBC >5 cells/µL, was
present in 91 cases (81%), with most having lymphocytic pre-
dominance. Median CSF protein and glucose were 43 (range,
17–921; IQR, 34–60) mg/dL and 59 (range, 37–154; IQR, 53–
68) mg/dL, respectively (referent normal values: CSF protein
<45 mg/dL; CSF glucose ≥40 mg/dL).
CDC Laboratory Results
CDC laboratories tested CSF from 55 patients (Table 3; Supple-
mentary Figure 3). The median duration between respiratory/
febrile illness onset and CSF collection (earliest sample if >1
from a patient) was 7.5 days (IQR, 5–13 days) (Supplementary
Figure 4). One CSF specimen tested positive for EV-D68 by
rRT-PCR, as well as for Epstein-Barr virus by FRET-rPCR;

 however, this specimen had >3000 red blood cells/µL, and no
corresponding blood sample was available to clarify whether
virus was present in blood. No other CSF specimens tested at
CDC using pathogen-specific primers or serologic assays pro-
duced a positive result. Of 35 CSF specimens tested by metage-
nomic sequencing, 14 resulted in detection of several different
viruses unlikely to be of clinical significance (Table 3). No path-
ogens were detected in the 6 CSF specimens examined by elec-
tron microscopy.
Using the earliest respiratory specimen for 56 patients that
submitted at least 1 specimen, 11 (20%) nasopharyngeal/oro-
pharyngeal specimens were positive for EV-D68 (includes pa-
tients from 6 different states), and 12 (21%) were positive for
other enteroviruses/rhinoviruses (Table 3; Supplementary Ta-
bles 2 and 3). The proportion positive for EV-D68 increased
in specimens collected closer to onset of respiratory/febrile ill-
ness, with 47% (8/17) of respiratory specimens collected ≤7
days from respiratory/febrile illness onset positive for EV-D68
(Supplementary Table 3). All serum/plasma specimens from 43
patients tested negative for enteroviruses by RT-PCR (Table 3).
None of the 35 sera tested positive for IgM antibodies against
arboviruses (West Nile, LaCrosse, St Louis encephalitis). None
of the 54 stool/rectal swab specimens tested positive for polio-
virus by culture or rRT-PCR; EV-D68 was also not detected in
stool (Table 3; Supplementary Tables 4 and 5). By family/genus
taxon-specific viral PCRs of specimens other than CSF, a few
viruses were detected in low frequency.
External Laboratory Results
The reported number of tests conducted on each specimen in
laboratories outside of CDC (eg, hospitals, independent clinical
laboratories, state laboratories) varied. Three patients were

 reported to have viral RNA/DNA detected in CSF: 1 each with
cytomegalovirus, echovirus 11, and human parechovirus.
Among all specific viral testing results reported from any speci-
men type, only EVD-68 (in respiratory specimens from 8 pa-
tients) was detected in ≥2 patients (Supplementary Table 6).
Correlation With National Respiratory Illness
The majority of cases (97 [81%]) experienced limb weakness
onset during 1 August–31 October 2014, with peak onset in
mid/late September. This coincides with the increase and
peak in pediatric emergency department visits for dyspnea col-
lected in BioSense, as well as the number of respiratory samples
sent from states to CDC for EV-D68 testing and the proportion
testing positive (Figure 1).
DISCUSSION
We report 120 cases of pediatric AFM, most occurring during a
national outbreak of EV-D68–associated respiratory illness.
Neurologic illness was characterized by asymmetric flaccid
limb weakness and spinal MRI findings showing gray matter in-
volvement. Among those with follow-up information, most
made some recovery, but few a full recovery. This clinical and
neuroimaging phenotype is identical to that observed with po-
liovirus-associated acute paralysis. No pathogens were consis-
tently detected in CSF or serum.
AFM cases were tightly clustered in time, and anecdotally,
clinicians from several locations stated that the number of
AFM cases observed over the 5-month period was unprecedent-
ed in their experience. However, we cannot confirm whether
there was truly an increase in cases over previous years, as sur-
veillance for neither AFM nor AFP is routinely conducted in the
United States.
Since the elimination of wild-type poliovirus from the West-
ern Hemisphere in 1991 [19], most AFP cases among all ages
worldwide have been attributable to Guillain-Barré syndrome,
an immune-mediated condition affecting peripheral nerves
and nerve roots (not spinal gray matter). There are other recog-
nized etiologies of AFP, and specifically AFM, including nonpo-
lio enteroviruses [20–22], flaviviruses such as West Nile,
St Louis, and Japanese encephalitis viruses [4, 23, 24], herpesvi-
ruses [25, 26], adenoviruses [27, 28], and others [3]. Although
these pathogens may also be associated with other forms of
Table 3.

 AFP, including Guillain-Barré syndrome and acute transverse
myelitis, AFM caused by these pathogens usually occurs spor-
adically, with the exception of EV-A71 outbreaks in East Asia
[29, 30]. An estimate of the incidence of nonpoliovirus AFM,
however, is hampered by lack of systematic surveillance and lab-
oratory testing.
In late summer and early fall 2014, clinicians throughout
the country noted an increase in hospitalizations for severe re-
spiratory illness among children, suspected to be associated
with EV-D68 [13, 31]. Outbreaks of EV-D68–associated respi-
ratory illness were also reported in other countries in 2014
[32–37]. We demonstrated in several states with BioSense data
that the occurrence of AFM aligned with the increase in pedi-
atric emergency department visits for dyspnea and few AFM
cases occurred after dyspnea visits declined by early October
2014. We continued to conduct AFM surveillance in 2015,
and from 1 January through 31 December, 16 individuals meet-
ing the 2014 case definition were reported from 13 states; 9 cases
occurred from August through December. Moreover, passive
surveillance at CDC did not identify any cases of EV-D68 respi-
ratory illness in 2015. This temporal association between AFM
and EV-D68 respiratory illness in 2014, and the lack of both in
2015, may suggest a causal association, although the association
is ecological and surveillance was only done for 2 enterovirus
seasons [8, 38].
There is biological plausibility to support such a causal asso-
ciation—other enteroviruses are recognized to cause AFM, most
notably poliovirus and enterovirus-A71 [39, 40]. Moreover,
EV-D68 has been detected in the CSF of a child with fatal
meningomyeloencephalitis, as well as in the blood and upper
respiratory tract of patients with AFM [35, 38, 41, 42]. However,
despite testing of numerous CSF specimens as part of our na-
tional investigation (Supplementary Figure 2), we identified
only 1 case with EV-D68 nucleic acid in the CSF, suggesting
the presence of the virus within the intrathecal space. However,
given the presence of red blood cells in the CSF, it is possible
that the blood was the source of the EV-D68 (ie, from a pre-
sumptive viremia). Experience with other viruses that cause
AFM suggests that while identification of intrathecal presence
of virus by culture or PCR is difficult, a certain percentage of
cases would be expected to test positive [43–46]. The detection
of EV-D68 in CSF could have been hampered by delayed timing
of specimen collection in relation to direct viral neuronal inva-
sion and/or the relatively small number of samples to detect a
transient presence of virus in CSF. Alternatively, neuronal dam-
age could have been due to a postinfectious immune response;
inflammatory damage to gray matter, although less common
than to white matter, has increasingly been described in other
syndromes [47–49].
While overall only 20% of patients had EV-D68 detected in
upper respiratory tract specimens, it is possible that because
of the long interval between respiratory illness onset and
specimen collection, the virus could no longer be detected;
among respiratory specimens collected ≤7 days after res-
piratory illness/fever onset, 47% were positive for EV-D68.
However, detection of viruses in nonsterile sites, such as the
upper respiratory tract, in AFM patients has unclear etiologic
significance. The lack of EV-D68 in the stool has been shown
before [50].
Possibly EV-D68 is “necessary but not sufficient” in the path-
ogenesis of AFM, rather than being truly neuroinvasive, and
that other unknown factors, along with EV-D68 infection, are
necessary to cause AFM. While the possibility of an autoim-
mune etiology has also been raised, the clinical and neuroradio-
graphic findings are more consistent with a neuroinvasive viral
pathogen. This is suggested by the abrupt limb weakness onset,
the predominance of gray (rather than white) matter involve-
ment, and the apparent lack of response to immunosuppressive
therapy or significant improvement of neurologic deficits over
time [51–53].
Our investigation has several limitations. We utilized a very
specific case definition, including MRI findings, to ensure that
we identified cases with the same disease process. However,
we might have missed some true cases not meeting our strict
case definition, underestimating the true illness burden. Sev-
eral cases reported from Colorado presented with cranial
nerve deficits alone [8]; as we limited our surveillance to pa-
tients with limb weakness, we would have failed to identify
other possible neurologic manifestations of this syndrome.
Second, we received CSF specimens for testing at CDC on
only 46% of AFM cases. In some cases, timing of specimen
collection may not have been optimal to conclusively rule in
or rule out particular etiologies (eg, arboviral serologies). Fi-
nally, follow-up information was available only on about one-
half of patients, and the representativeness of those outcomes
is not known.
In the future, it will be important for clinicians to maintain
vigilance for AFM and report cases to public health officials,
both to better ascertain background incidence of this syndrome
and to provide early detection of large outbreak events. Appli-
cation of new laboratory diagnostic techniques may allow for
determination of causative etiologies for AFM. Furthermore,
as poliovirus is an important cause of AFM globally, it is critical
to document that polio has been ruled out with the involvement
of the state/local health department. Documentation should
include appropriate specimens for viral isolation, documented
poliovirus vaccine history, travel history, or exposure to some-
one who may have traveled, and 60-day follow-up of the neuro-
logic deficit (http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/surv-manual/
chpt12-polio.html). Collection of appropriate biological speci-
mens as early as possible will facilitate identification of an etiol-
ogy of AFM. Cooperation between clinicians and public health
officials will be important to better understand the epidemiolo-
gy and clinical features of AFM.
