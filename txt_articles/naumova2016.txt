Abstract
The Flint Water Crisis — due to changes of water source and treat-
ment procedures — has revealed many unsolved social, environmental, and public
health problems for US drinking water, including opportunistic premise plumbing
pathogens (OPPP). The true health impact of OPPP, especially in vulnerable po-
pulations such as the elderly, is largely unknown. We explored 108 claims in the
largest US national uniformly collected data repository to determine rates and
costs of OPPP-related hospitalizations. In 1991–2006, 617,291 cases of three se-
lected OPPP infections resulted in the elderly alone of $0.6 billion USD per year of
payments. Antibiotic resistance significantly increased OPPP illness costs that are
likely to be underreported. More precise estimates for OPPP burdens could be
obtained if better clinical, microbiological, administrative, and environmental m-
onitoring data were cross-linked. An urgent dialog across governmental and dis-
ciplinary divides, and studies on preventing OPPP through drinking water
exposure, are warranted.

 Introduction
The 2010 Report of the national Waterborne Disease and Outbreak
Surveillance System (WBDOSS) — established to document waterborne
disease outbreaks reported by local, state, and territorial health
departments — urged serious attention be paid to the growing propor-
tion of outbreaks associated with premise plumbing deficiencies in
public
water
systems,
noting
the
increasing
importance
of
Legionella since its 2001 inclusion in WBDOSS.1 According to the
2010 Report, between 2001 and 2006 Legionella was responsible for
29 per cent of the 84 drinking water outbreaks, and 80 per cent of the
15 drinking water-related deaths. Most of these legionellosis outbreaks
occurred in hospitals, health care facilities, and nursing homes. The
2015 Report stated that in 2011–2012, Legionella in drinking water
systems and deficiencies of untreated groundwater accounted for 72.4
per cent of all outbreak-associated cases.2
The ongoing Flint Water Crisis [Flint, Michigan] was triggered by
changes of water source and a lack of corrosion control treatment. The
corrosive water mobilized lead, leading to the lead poisoning of Flint
residents.3 Less well known is that a simultaneous outbreak of 87 cases
of Legionnaires’ disease occurred in Genesee County, which includes
Flint, with 10 deaths.4 In addition to lead, the corrosive water may
have mobilized iron from the pipes. Furthermore, there were several
total coliform violations in Flint, which may also have been indicative
of the lack of adequate chlorine residual. The residual chlorine
disinfectant in Flint water may have been depleted by reactions with
iron, allowing OPPP such as Legionella to flourish. Iron is believed to
support the growth of Legionella bacteria.5
First recognized in Philadelphia in 1976,6,7 Legionella is the most
frequently recognized OPP pathogen in both community and hospital
settings. There is increasing awareness that the ‘normal microbial
inhabitants’ of premise (household or building) plumbing may account
for a greater proportion of waterborne disease outbreaks, and serious
community and hospital-acquired infections, than previously envi-
sioned. Modern water treatment facilities successfully eliminate almost
all the common fecal-borne pathogens found in source waters. Yet in
building water systems, microorganisms such as Legionella, Pseu-
domonas, and atypical mycobacteria can live on trace amounts of
organic matter, attach to pipe inner surfaces, and grow as microbial

 biofilms encased in an extracellular polysaccharide (EPS) matrix.8–11
The negative charge and hydrophobic nature of the EPS enables the
biofilm to concentrate ions and dissolved organic carbon from the
oligotrophic bulk fluid, thus permitting organisms to grow in low
nutrient conditions. Some free-living amoebae inhabiting water are
highly resistant to chemical and physical disinfection, particularly in
their dormant cyst stage, and can easily withstand the high temperature
disinfection treatments currently used in healthcare facility (hospital)
settings.8 Biofilms represent an important ecological niche, and biofilm
infections are implicated in more than 80 per cent of hospital-
associated and prosthetic device infections.9,10 Furthermore, water
aerosolization becomes an important mode of transmission for
legionellosis and other emerging infections. The ability of OPPP to
grow as microbial biofilms in water provides them selective advantages,
including (1) growth in low nutrient conditions, (2) resistance to
antibiotics and disinfectants, (3) high metabolic and phenotypic
diversity, enabling them to withstand environmental stresses (pH,
UV, low oxygen), (4) horizontal gene transfer of antibiotic resistance
and virulence genes, and (5) efficient transmission via ingestion,
aerosols, and contact.8,10,12,13 A recent study of OPPP in chloraminated
drinking water distribution systems using quantitative PCR methods
revealed a high occurrence of Legionella spp. (C69 per cent) and non-
tuberculous mycobacteria (100 per cent), a lower prevalence of L.
pneumophila (B20 per cent) and M. avium (B33.3 per cent), and
uncommon detection of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (B13.3 per cent).14
In this communication, we explored the burden and cost of OPPP
hospitalizations associated with diagnosis of Legionella pneumophila,
Mycobacterium avium, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, as well as
reported drug resistance, and reported charges to and reimbursements
from Medicare.
Materials and Methods
We have used a data repository of 108 hospitalization records to
describe emerging trends in hospitalization rates due to various
infectious agents, and to determine the effects of environmental
exposures at the national level.15–18 The national data repository of
medical claims, maintained by the US Centers for Medicare and

 Medicaid Services (CMS), offers a universal, uniform, and near-
exhaustive coverage of US Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 and older. It
contains information on age, ZIP code of residence, date of admission,
direct charges to and reimbursements from Medicare (Part B), and up
to 10 diagnostic codes based on International Classification of Disease,
9th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM).
We abstracted hospitalization records for infections with three model
OPPP: Legionella pneumophila, Mycobacterium avium, and Pseu-
domonas aeruginosa,12 using ICD-9CM codes: 482.1, 482.81, 482.84,
and 031.x reported in primary or secondary diagnostic fields (see
Table 1) during a 16-year period, from January 1st 1991 to December
31st 2006 among US residents aged 65 and older. We then tabulated all
abstracted cases based on drug resistance (ICD:V09) reported in any
diagnostic fields. ICD codes for infections with microorganisms
resistant to cephalosporins and other B-lactam antibiotics (V09.1),
macrolides
(V09.2),
tetracyclines
(V09.3),
and
aminoglycosides
(V09.4) were included in total drug resistance counts; ICD codes for
infections with microorganisms resistant to quinolones and fluoro-
quinolones (V09.5), other specified antimycobacterial agents (V09.7),
and other specified drugs without resistance to multiple drugs (V09.80)
were aggregated and cross-tabulated. We calculated the proportions of
cases with multiple drug resistance, denoted by additional subcoding
(V09.x1), to the number of cases with reported resistance by V09.5,
V09.7, V09.8, and V09.9.
Results
Of 18,202,047 hospitalizations due to pneumonia, 2,909,843 (16 per
cent) were explicitly coded as bacterial pneumonia (ICD:482) that
allowed detailed subcoding. A unique code (ICD:482.84) widely used
by 1997 allowed the abstraction of 7,933 records for Legionnaires’
disease. (Prior to 1997, Legionnaires’ disease cases were likely coded
under ICD:482.8 that included all anaerobic and facultative gram-
negative organisms.) We also identified 544,643 records of hospital-
ization in the elderly due to Pseudomonas (ICD:482.1) and 15,861

 ICD code 482 that lacked detailed subcoding, were not included in the
analysis.
We found 48,854 hospitalization records associated with non-
tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) (ICD:031). This code was further
divided into subcategories including pulmonary infection caused by
NTMs including Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare [‘Battey bacil-
lus’], that contributed 71 per cent of NTM-related cases (ICD:031.0).
The rest (29 per cent) was associated with cutaneous infections caused
by NTMs (ICD:031.1), disseminated, or blood stream infections caused
predominately by Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare (MAI) and
Mycobacterium
avium-intracellulare
complex
(MAC)
bacteremia
(ICD:031.2), other specified mycobacterial diseases (ICD:031.8), and
unspecified diseases due to mycobacteria or an atypical mycobacterium
infection ‘‘not otherwise specified’’ (031.9).
We identified 11,861 cases of drug resistance for one pathogen, and
53 cases in which two pathogens were implicated in positive resistance
tests. Drug resistance was reported for each diagnostic code and ranged
from 1.68 per cent for Pseudomonas pulmonary infections, to 1.05 per
cent for NTM pulmonary infections, and 0.6 per cent for Legionnaires’
disease (Table 1). One alarming finding was the magnitude of observed
multidrug resistance, which reached 50 per cent for fluoroquinolones
and antimycobacterial agents.
Overall, reported drug resistance led to a 32.8 per cent increase in per
case charges to Medicare. The estimated payments for Pseudomonas
aeruginosa totaled $8.8 billion USD over the 15 years, with a high
mean per case differential payment of $14,510 ($62,440 resistant,
versus $47,930 no resistance, D = $14,510 or 30.3 per cent). Of note,
this significant difference in charges submitted to Medicare for resistant
cases was not reflected in actual payments that were made (Table 1).
Discussion
We found the economic burden of three OPPP infections in persons
aged C65 years averaged $0.6 billion per year over a 15-year period
(1991–2006) in reimbursed payments to hospitals. Given these costs,
recent outbreaks of Legionnaire’s disease, and the rising incidence of
hospital-acquired OPPP illnesses, enhanced identification and reporting
of these infections is warranted.

 There has been a substantial increase in Pseudomonas infections in
the last decade. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC) recently reported19 that this infection accounts for 51,000 cases
(8 per cent) of healthcare-associated infections per year. More than
6000 (13 per cent) of these cases were multidrug-resistant infections
with [
70 per cent increased cost compared to non-resistant infec-
tions.20 Pseudomonas has been linked to waterborne biofilm infections,
particularly in burn and cystic fibrosis patients, and infections involving
solutions used for surface sterilization, indwelling catheters, broncho-
scopes, hot tubs, and sink traps and aerosolizers.9,10 This increase in
reported Pseudomonas infections has been demonstrable despite
incomplete reporting for key OPPP organisms.
The increase in legionellosis is concerning. As reported by the CDC,
during 2000–2011, passive surveillance for legionellosis in the United
States demonstrated a 249 per cent increase in crude incidence, from
0.39 to 1.36 cases per 100,000 persons.21 The risk factors, causal links,
preventive measures against drug resistance, and control options are far
from being defined. Microbiology laboratories report only incident
cases of Legionella pneumophila and M. tuberculosis complex to public
health authorities. They do not report atypical mycobacteria (such as
M. avium) or Pseudomonas. Most cases of Legionella are diagnosed by
a rapid urinary assay for Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1 antigen
(which accounts for 80 per cent of cases). In some US states, results are
sent to the public health authorities via a secure electronic mechanism.
Otherwise, cultures of respiratory secretions are plated on selective
media, and may be sent to reference laboratories for identification and
antibiotic sensitivity testing. If a reportable organism is cultured, the
isolate is forwarded to the state reference laboratory. Furthermore,
OPPP may also disproportionally affect immunocompromised elderly,
and those with HIV.24 Yet OPPP are rarely tested for in community
settings, even in severely ill patients. Thus the true incidence is likely to
be substantially underestimated, given the limitation of available data
and inpatient hospital care practices. Indeed, 40 per cent of Legionella
cases reported to the CDC 2000–200925 occurred in persons aged C60,
suggesting that the true clinical and economic burden may be 2–3 times
larger than our estimate.
We estimated annual charges to Medicare for Legionnaires’ disease
and NTM infections as $339,970,596 and $88,008,503, respectively.
Our estimates for the per case costs for these two infections ($42,855

Vol. 37, 4, 500–513
507
 and $27,022, respectively) were similar to the estimates provided by
others for hospitalization costs per episode of $33,336 and $25,985.22
As expected, the reimbursed payments per case were smaller than the
charges. Both payments and charges were *10–40 per cent higher for
resistant than for non-resistant infections. In 1991–2006, the total
payment to hospitals for the three model OPPP-related infections in this
dataset was about $9 billion for more than 41,000 cases per annum.
The annual costs may now exceed $2 billion for 80,000 cases per
year.8,22 Our data and conclusions are consistent with analyses of
infections by resistant versus antimicrobial-susceptible organisms.
These analyses have found greater hospital charges, longer lengths of
stay, and increased risk of death.23
While the proportion of hospitalizations with reported resistance was
fewer than 2 per cent, we found that the incidence of multiple drug
resistance was high. This may be the result of selection for resistance in
hospital-acquired infections due in part to the ability of these organisms
to grow in a biofilm community where transfer of genetic elements
(antibiotic resistance genes, phages, plasmids) occurs.9,10 Water stress
conditions such as low, non-killing levels of disinfectants and low
nutrients induce upregulation of transferable elements.9,10,12 We
differentiate multidrug resistance from the ‘intrinsic’ resistance these
OPPP have to penicillin (V09.0) and vancomycin (V09.8), that ranged
between 69 per cent and 91 per cent, as expected. We note that
vancomycin antibiotic resistance was reported in 91 per cent of our
identified cases, suggesting that in 9 per cent sensitivity to vancomycin
was present. This would occur if the reported resistance were for a non-
OPPP second organism such as Staphylococcus aureus, a common
‘‘second infection’’ bacterium. We thus attribute *9 per cent to
multiple organism infections for which different-organism resistance
coding might occur. This highlights the limitations of data collection as
it currently stands.
A restricted coding for antimicrobial resistance that captures
exclusively the primary pathogen rather than all tested is a serious
limitation of administrative databases. Another limitation of this study
is that historic administrative hospitalization records are substantially
inferior to direct clinical or microbiological testing results, and
antibiotic resistance reporting is likely to be incomplete in administra-
tive records. The reporting improved in the last decade, yet the
incentives for hospitals to test are likely to be insufficient. For example,
Naumova et al
508

Journal of Public Health Policy
Vol. 37, 4, 500–513
 in 2013, the CDC estimated that 6700 hospital-acquired infections
with MDR Pseudomonas occur per year in all age groups, based upon
sentinel laboratory site reporting data. In contrast, we found 8998
Pseudomonas pneumonia in CMS records that reported resistance
during 1991–2006, equivalent to *600 cases per year. We suspect this
is a substantial undercount. Similar discrepancies are noted for
Legionella. In 2000–2009, adults over 60 y.o. had contributed half
of 22,418 cases of legionellosis, which is equivalent to *1120 annual
reports to the CDC25 and twice of *530 annual records we had
identified in the CMS database. We also found a pattern of higher
charges for resistant infections, but not a consistent pattern of increased
payments (See Table 1). If in fact true costs were higher for antimi-
crobial-resistant infections than for susceptible ones, but payments are
not significantly different, it is very likely that there have been little or
no incentive for hospitals to test for resistant organisms.
Only over the past decade has there been a stronger mandate to
report healthcare-associated infections (HAI) to the CDC’s National
Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN).19,26 These reports include infec-
tions of surgical sites, bloodstream intravenous catheter lines, urinary
catheters, and ventilator-associated pneumonias obtained through
CMS hospital inpatient quality reporting programs. With new ICD
coding rules implemented in 2015, reporting of HAI will be substan-
tially improved. The ICD-10 rules require reporting specific infection
locations, the organism, and resistance for certain bacteria, including
methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and vancomycin-
resistant enterococci (VRE). Hospitals also have additional financial
incentives to report, as they receive higher reimbursements for treating
drug-resistant than drug-sensitive infections.
A strength of this study is that it used a nationwide database of[
108
hospitalization records that comprehensively collates data from [
96
per cent of the US elderly. Benefits accrue to linking administrative data
with more accurate clinical or microbiological data. The ICD-10
changes are a first step to creating better cross-link across various
reporting strategies. Recent hospitalization administrative records are
likely to reflect increased vigilance to both community- and hospital-
acquired infections.
While reporting of OPPP was imperfect during 1991–2006, we
nonetheless found highly significant differences in costs when treating
antibiotic resistant infections. Our central finding, that resistant OPPP

 organisms are associated with higher economic burden is, if anything,
an underestimate based on the number of recorded cases. If antibiotic
resistance was not consistently recorded, then the ‘true’ economic
burden of resistance per episode would be underestimated, because the
category of non-resistant infections may contain some episodes with
resistant organisms.
What to do next? Studies examining the epidemiology and microbial
ecology of OPPP could inform thoughtful strategies to reliably reduce
OPPP human disease. Targeted investigations should examine common
ecological factors shared by OPPP, such as biofilm formation. Imple-
menting plumbing rules that eliminate or reduce OPPP organisms in
water systems of healthcare facility buildings or in the homes of at-risk
persons (such as those with cystic fibrosis or immunocompromised)
may prove most effective.13 The long-term effectiveness, safety, and
cost associated with coatings that prevent biofilm formation either by
chemical modification or micropatterned surfaces within the plumbing
pipes could be further examined. Should they be used in high-risk
surgical or hospital settings?9,10,27
Water distribution systems across the US are aging, which will
increase their susceptibility to OPPP contamination. Budgets for state
and federal water regulators have decreased in real dollar terms. The
annual budget of the EPA’s Office of Ground Water and Drinking
Water declined 15 per cent from 2006 to 2015. It lost over 10 per cent
of its employees. In 2013, the Association of State Drinking Water
Administrators reported that ‘‘federal officials had slashed drinking-
water grants, 17 states had cut drinking-water budgets by more than a
fifth, and 27 had cut spending on full-time employees,’’ with ‘‘serious
implications for states’ ability to protect public health’’.28
Premise plumbing systems are generally unregulated and fall outside
the purview of most federal (e.g., Safe Drinking Water Act) and state
regulatory agencies. In combination, these factors will inevitably lead
to inconsistent monitoring and reporting despite warnings to the
contrary.1 The rise of OPPP infections is a clear call for an urgent
dialog across disciplinary boundaries and government agencies, stake-
holders, and policy makers.
