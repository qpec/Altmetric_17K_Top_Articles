ABSTRACT
Objectives: To assess the evidence for price-based
alcohol policy interventions to determine whether
minimum unit pricing (MUP) is likely to be effective.
Design: Systematic review and assessment of studies
according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic
Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines,
against the Bradford Hill criteria for causality. Three
electronic databases were searched from inception to
February 2017. Additional articles were found through
hand searching and grey literature searches.
Criteria for selecting studies: We included any
study design that reported on the effect of price-
based interventions on alcohol consumption or
alcohol-related morbidity, mortality and wider harms.
Studies reporting on the effects of taxation or
affordability and studies that only investigated price
elasticity of demand were beyond the scope of this
review. Studies with any conflict of interest were
excluded. All studies were appraised for
methodological quality.
Results: Of 517 studies assessed, 33 studies were
included: 26 peer-reviewed research studies and seven
from the grey literature. All nine of the Bradford Hill
criteria were met, although different types of study
satisfied different criteria. For example, modelling
studies complied with the consistency and specificity
criteria, time series analyses demonstrated the
temporality and experiment criteria, and the analogy
criterion was fulfilled by comparing the findings with
the wider literature on taxation and affordability.
Conclusions: Overall, the Bradford Hill criteria for
causality were satisfied. There was very little evidence
that minimum alcohol prices are not associated with
consumption or subsequent harms. However the
overall quality of the evidence was variable, a large
proportion of the evidence base has been produced by
a small number of research teams, and the quantitative
uncertainty in many estimates or forecasts is often
poorly communicated outside the academic literature.
Nonetheless, price-based alcohol policy interventions
such as MUP are likely to reduce alcohol consumption,
alcohol-related morbidity and mortality.
INTRODUCTION
There are many policies and programmes
that aim to reduce harms from alcohol.1
One of these is minimum alcohol pricing,
which exists in a number of countries around
the world. The most notable example of
this is Canada, where there are government
monopolies on alcohol sales and a variety of
types of minimum pricing in operation. For
example, there is a minimum price per litre
of a particular drink in British Columbia2 and
a (higher) minimum price linked to drink
type and strength in Saskatchewan.3 Other
countries
with
minimum
alcohol
pricing
include Belarus, Kyrgyzstan, the Republic of
Moldova,
the
Russian
Federation
and
Ukraine.4 Minimum alcohol pricing is being
considered by governments in Ireland5 and
has also been reviewed in Australia6 and New
Zealand.7
The situation with regards to minimum
alcohol
pricing
in
the
UK
is
complex.
Strengths and limitations of this study
▪ This review adds to an emerging literature of sys-
tematic reviews synthesising findings using the
Bradford Hill criteria for causality in research
areas where traditional meta-analyses of rando-
mised controlled trials are not possible or
appropriate.
▪ A range of study designs were included, allowing
for a comprehensive review of a disparate evi-
dence base to investigate whether minimum unit
pricing of alcohol is likely to reduce alcohol con-
sumption and alcohol-related harm.
▪ Studies examining the effects of alcohol taxation
or changes in alcohol affordability, or studies
solely reporting on price elasticity of demand,
were not included.
▪ Methodological quality of studies was variable.

 In England and Wales, there has been a ban on alcohol
being sold at below cost (the total amount of ‘duty plus
value added tax (VAT)’) since May 2014;8 and the first
conviction for selling alcohol below this level took place
in 2016.9 Duty plus VAT is equivalent to a 70 cl bottle of
vodka (37.5% alcohol by volume (ABV)) costing a
minimum of £8.72,10 whereas under a minimum price
of 50 pence per unit (one UK unit=10 mL or 8 g
ethanol), this would cost £13.13. In 2012, the UK coali-
tion
government
cited
support
for
minimum
unit
pricing (MUP) in its alcohol strategy,11 and legislation to
have a minimum price of £0.50 per unit was passed in
Scotland the same year.4 Following the change to a
Conservative majority government in 2015, it is unclear
whether there is still central government support for
MUP
. In Scotland, the Scotch Whisky Association chal-
lenged the 2012 legislation in the Scottish Court of
Session, which referred the case to the Court of Justice
of the European Union (CJEU) in 2014.12 In late 2015,
the CJEU referred the case back to the Scottish courts to
investigate
proportionality
(that
the
same
objective
cannot be met through increased taxation),13 which
could have implications for other EU countries consider-
ing MUP
. In late 2016, the Scottish Court of Session
ruled that MUP does not contravene EU law;14 however,
the Scotch Whisky Association then appealed to the UK
Supreme Court.15
In light of this ongoing consideration of MUP in the
UK,
in
this
paper
we
assess
the
effectiveness
of
minimum alcohol price interventions to reduce alcohol-
related harm. Alcohol-related harm costs the National
Health Service in England £3.5 billion each year and the
estimated cost to society is £21 billion per year.16 The
latest annual figures for England (population of 54
million) show over 1 million alcohol-related hospital
admissions
(2013/2014)
and
6500
alcohol-related
deaths (2013); and these figures represent increases
compared with a decade previously of 115% and 10%,
respectively.16
We systematically review the literature on the effect of
price interventions or policies such as MUP on alcohol
consumption, alcohol-related morbidity and mortality,
and wider harms. We use the nine Bradford Hill criteria
for causality as a framework with the aim of assessing the
likely effectiveness of MUP as a policy to reduce alcohol
consumption and alcohol-related harm.
METHODS
A systematic literature search was performed according
to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and
Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidance (see figure 1 for

 Identification of studies
Three electronic databases were searched for titles or
abstracts
containing
‘minimum
unit
pric$’
OR
‘minimum pric$’ OR ‘floor pric$’ OR ‘pric$ AND
policy’ AND alcohol. The databases were PsycINFO
(1806 to February Week 2 2017), Embase (1974 to 2017
Week 07) and Ovid Medline (1946 to February Week 2
2017). We also searched the websites of five alcohol
charities for publications or reports related to ‘price’,
and also searched 20 leading UK think tanks for
‘alcohol’ or ‘addiction’.
Inclusion criteria were: any study design; population-
level studies exploring at least one aspect of the effect of
interventions or policies leading to changes in the
minimum price of alcohol, including but not limited to
changes in alcohol sales, consumption, morbidity and
mortality;
and
individual-level
studies
exploring
minimum alcohol prices and alcohol purchasing, con-
sumption, morbidity or mortality; written in English.
Exclusion criteria were: studies about taxation, afford-
ability,
price
elasticity of
demand
for alcohol
and
general changes in alcohol price not the result of an
intervention or policy (there is a large literature on each
of these already and reviewing all of these studies was
beyond the scope of this review); studies about public
perceptions of MUP; and studies where a conflict of
interest was reported in the paper, whether this was in
favour of or against MUP
.
All 33 studies that met the inclusion criteria were
assessed against the Bradford Hill criteria for causality
and
the
methodological
quality
appraised.
These
included 26 original research studies and seven studies
from the grey literature, and in addition two systematic
reviews pertinent to the analogy criterion were included.
Of the 26 research studies, there were 9 cross-sectional
surveys, 8 time series analyses or similar, 7 modelling
studies, 1 qualitative study and 1 trial.
Analysis of included studies
Quality of included studies was assessed independently
by two reviewers and using validated tools. Owing to the
wide variation in study designs among the included
studies, the Effective Public Health Practice Project’s
(EPHPP) tool was used for assessing all quantitative
studies, as recommended by the Cochrane Handbook
for assessing
studies in public health.17 Qualitative
studies (n=1) and systematic reviews (n=2) included in
this review were not covered by the EPHPP tool and so
were
assessed
using
the
Critical
Appraisal
Skills
Programme (CASP) tools specific to these study designs.
Nine criteria to determine causality were suggested by
Bradford Hill in an influential 1965 paper.18 Increasingly,
the Bradford Hill criteria are a standard framework to
assess the impact of interventions where it is not ethical
or practical to conduct randomised controlled trials
(RCTs). Our interpretation of the Bradford Hill criteria
for the purpose of this review is listed in table 1. Two
reviewers assessed each study against each of the nine
criteria and agreed which studies provided relevant evi-
dence for or against each criterion.
RESULTS
The included studies that are published in peer-reviewed
journals (26 research studies and two systematic reviews)
are listed by study type in table 2 with information on
study characteristics and methodological quality. Of the
research studies, the methodological quality was rated as
‘strong’ in 15 studies, ‘moderate’ in 8 studies and ‘weak’
in 3 studies. Both of the systematic reviews were rated
‘strong’. The seven reports from the grey literature are
listed in table 3. Five of the seven were rated as of
‘strong’ methodological quality, with the remaining two
not appropriate to rate using our critical appraisal tools.
Consideration against the Bradford Hill criteria
for determining causality
Strength of the association
In 16/26 studies published in peer-reviewed journals,
strength of the association between pricing and alcohol
consumption or alcohol-related harm was evidenced by
a summary statistic such as an OR, and by a test of the
statistical significance of the association. As well as the
statistical significance of the summary statistic, the mag-
nitude of the effect was also considered, as a larger
effect size corresponds to a greater population health
impact. Studies in Canada found that 10% increases
in minimum prices were associated with reductions in
alcohol consumption of 3.4–8.4%,2
3 reductions in
alcohol-attributable hospital admissions of 9%21 and
reductions in alcohol-related mortality of 32%, each of
which
was
statistically
significant.24
Cross-sectional
studies in the UK, Ireland, Australia32–36 38–40 and one
trial from the USA41 found statistically significant asso-
ciations between cheaper alcohol and heavier drinking.
The magnitude of the association varied across these
studies, but due to different study measures and out-
comes, the results are not all comparable. As an indica-
tion, the OR for buying alcohol below a proposed
minimum price among heavier drinkers was 1.34 in
Crawford’s study,35 1.50 in Cousins’s study34 and 1.70 in
Callinan’s
study.33 There was not any evidence
to
support this criterion from the grey literature. Overall,
there is reasonably good support for the strength of the
association criterion.
Consistency
This criterion requires looking across all the studies
included in the review to see whether similar conclu-
sions have been drawn. Inverse associations between
alcohol pricing and alcohol consumption or harm have
been
documented
in
countries
in
Europe,
North
America and Australia, and although most studies are
from the last 10 years, there are studies from the 1970s
and 1980s as well. There is evidence from different
research teams and different types of study including

BMJ Open: first published as 10.1136/bmjopen-2016-013497 on 6 June 2017. Downloaded from 
 cross-sectional studies, time series analyses and econo-
metric modelling studies. Support for the consistency
criterion is very strong.
Specificity
The specificity criterion relates to whether changes in
alcohol consumption or harm could be attributed to any-
thing other than the price intervention. Many studies
included
have statistically adjusted for confounding
factors; however, the best support for the specificity cri-
terion comes from the econometric modelling studies
because there is no risk of residual confounding. The
Sheffield Alcohol Policy Model is one such model and
has been applied in England,25–29 47 Scotland45 51 and
Canada48 and provides very strong support for the speci-
ficity criterion. Further support is provided by other dif-
ferent modelling studies in the UK49 50 and Australia30 31
and a (non-randomised) trial in the USA.41 Thus,
support for the specificity criteria is very strong.
Temporality
It is important that pricing interventions take place
before changes to alcohol consumption and harm to
attribute causality. Strong support for this criterion
Table 1
Bradford Hill criteria for assessing causation and the definitions used in this review
Criterion
Bradford Hill criteria (1965)
Application in this review
1. Strength of the
association
The strength of a supposed association between an
intervention and an outcome is determined by the
appropriate statistic used to measure the protective
effect of an intervention (eg, relative risk or OR).
This is the most important factor determining
causation
A statistically significant change (p<0.05) in alcohol
consumption or alcohol-related harms, in the
expected direction. The exact magnitude of the
association was assessed on a study by study
basis
2. Consistency
Has it been repeatedly observed by different
persons, in different places, circumstances and
times?
Whether different studies conducted in different
locations, in different populations, by different
investigators and at different times have reported
similar findings
3. Specificity
Specificity is present when the intervention is
exclusive to the outcome and when the outcome
has no other known cause or associated risk
factors; cautions that this criterion should not be
overemphasised and that if specificity is not
apparent, this does not preclude causation
If pricing was the only reason that alcohol
consumption or alcohol-related harm could have
fallen, this adds to the argument for causality.
However, if a price intervention was one of a
number of alcohol policy interventions, then this
criterion is not satisfied
4. Temporality
Refers to temporal relationship of association
between exposure and disease outcome; to infer
causality, exposure must precede outcome
The pricing intervention studied must have taken
place before a change in alcohol consumption or
harm was observed
5. Dose–
response
If the association is one in which a dose–response
curve or biological gradient can be observed, this
adds to the case for causality
If interventions leading to a larger increase in prices
had a greater effect on alcohol consumption and
alcohol-related harm than interventions where the
price change was small, or if studies demonstrate
that different minimum prices have differing effects,
in the expected direction
6. Plausibility
A likely biological mechanism linking the
intervention to the observed findings helps to
explain causality; plausibility depends on biological
knowledge of the day
Studies that found an association between price
and population-level alcohol consumption and that
heavier drinkers tend to purchase the cheapest
alcohol could demonstrate plausibility
7. Coherence
When the evidence from different disciplines
sources ‘hangs well together’ and does not conflict
with other generally known facts, this criterion is
met
Describes whether studies conducted in different
settings or disciplines had complementary findings.
Will not be demonstrated by a single study in
isolation but rather the evidence base as a whole
8. Experiment
Experimental evidence from laboratory studies or
RCTs could potentially provide strongest support for
causation
This criterion often provides the strongest support
for causation and describes whether there is
empirical evidence for the association
In addition to laboratory studies and RCTs, natural
experiments with before-and-after measures could
also show the effectiveness of minimum unit pricing
in a ‘real-world’ setting
9. Analogy
Causality is supported by analogy if there are
similar associations or causal relationships in other
areas of relevance, weakest form of evidence of
causality
Other areas of relevance include whether higher
taxation on alcohol is associated with reduced
alcohol consumption and alcohol-related harm, and
may require drawing on additional literature outside
of the main systematic review
RCTs, randomised controlled trials.

 comes from research following the introduction of MUP
in Canada, where minimum price increases preceded
reductions in alcohol consumption,2 3 alcohol-attribut-
able hospital admissions21 and alcohol-related mortal-
ity.24
Studies
where
price
changes
preceded
the
expected changes in alcohol consumption or harm have
also been conducted in Russia,19
22 Poland23 and
Finland.20 Overall, there is very strong support for the
temporality criterion.
Dose–response/biological gradient
This criterion is supported if different price levels have
been found to have differing effects on consumption or
harm. Many of the studies using the Sheffield Alcohol
Policy Model explore the impact of a range of potential
MUP options,25 27 29 45 51 and these consistently suggest
that the higher the MUP the greater the reductions in
alcohol consumption or alcohol-related harms. The
Canadian studies of minimum pricing lend further
support for this criterion because the analysis presents
the effect on consumption or harm of a modelled 1%
increase
in
price,
meaning
dose
response
can
be
inferred.2 3 21 24 Dose response is supported to a lesser
extent by evidence from cross-sectional studies that
heavier drinkers are more likely to pay less than a pro-
posed MUP
.32–34 39 40 Overall, there is strong support for
the dose–response criterion, although the relationship is
difficult to quantify.
Plausibility
This criterion refers to whether there is evidence that
alcohol price can be used as an economic mechanism to
influence
consumption
at
a
population
level,
and
whether
heavy
drinkers
tend
to
purchase
cheaper
alcohol. There is evidence from 21/26 research studies
and 4/7 studies in the grey literature that the price of
alcohol is inversely related to alcohol-related morbidity,
hospital admissions or mortality. Moreover, there is also
evidence from numerous cross-sectional studies in the
UK, Ireland and Australia32–36 38–40 and one trial from
the USA41 that heavier drinking was significantly asso-
ciated with purchasing alcohol below specified prices,
further suggesting that economic mechanisms such as
minimum pricing would particularly affect the heaviest
drinkers. This provides strong support for the plausibility
criterion.
Coherence
This criterion refers to whether studies from different
disciplines
have
had
complementary
findings
and
whether these fit or ‘hang’ well together. It is different
to consistency, which is more concerned with reproduci-
bility of findings. The findings of the majority of studies
supported the coherence criterion in that they suggest
that real-world MUP
2
3
21
24 or minimum price
increases 19 20 23 led to reductions in alcohol consump-
tion
and
alcohol-related
harm
and
cross-sectional
surveys find that it is the heavier drinkers that are
drinking the cheapest alcohol.32
40 The modelling
studies which use survey data in turn suggest heavier
drinkers will be most affected by MUP
.26 Overall, the evi-
dence base provides strong support for this criterion.
Experiment
We have not identified any RCTs of minimum pricing or
price-based interventions to reduce alcohol consump-
tion. There is a small (and not randomised) trial from
the 1970s41 which found participants living in controlled
conditions and offered a daily ‘happy hour’ discount
drank significantly more alcohol than those who were
not offered the discount. There is, however, substantial
evidence in support of the experiment criterion from
time series analyses or natural experiments, for example,
where minimum pricing was introduced in Canada3 21 24
and where prices fluctuated in the late 1980s and early
1990s in Russia,19 22 and to a lesser extent in Finland,
where minimum price increases were associated with
reduced mortality only among men with a basic educa-
tion.20 These studies provide tentative support for the
experiment criterion.
Analogy
To
address the
analogy
criterion,
areas
related
to
minimum alcohol pricing must be considered. There is
evidence from literature on the affordability of alcohol52
that consumption and harm are very responsive to the
affordability of alcohol. Large systematic reviews have
investigated the price elasticity of demand for alcohol,53
and have found that higher alcohol pricing and taxation
(considered together) are associated with reductions in
alcohol
consumption,
alcohol-related
morbidity
and
mortality.43 44 46 Overall, the support for the analogy cri-
terion is very strong, although Bradford Hill describes
this as the weakest evidence for causality.
DISCUSSION
We assessed 26 research studies and two systematic
reviews, plus a further seven studies from the grey
literature in this review of the evidence for priced-based
interventions—such as MUP—to reduce alcohol con-
sumption and alcohol-related harm. All nine of the
Bradford Hill criteria for causality were met and the vast
majority of studies offered support for price-based
alcohol policy interventions. However, the evidence for
two of the criteria, although present, was not as strong
as it was for the other criteria. These criteria were
strength of the association (criterion 1) and experiment
(criterion 8), and according to Bradford Hill, these are
the two criteria that can provide the strongest evidence
for causality. Therefore, although all of the criteria were
supported, we conclude that it is highly probable, but
not definite, that introducing MUP for alcohol would
reduce alcohol consumption and alcohol-related harms.
It is also of note that different types of study tended to
satisfy different Bradford Hill criteria, and that different

 study designs also produced evidence of the effective-
ness of minimum pricing in relation to different out-
comes. This is summarised in figure 2. This underlines
the importance of including a variety of study designs in
this review.
Strengths of this study are that this is the first to have
systematically reviewed the literature relevant specifically
to alcohol minimum pricing policies. We had broad
inclusion criteria with regards to study design, price
intervention and outcome measure, allowing for a com-
prehensive review of the evidence base. Application of
the Bradford Hill criteria as part of a narrative systematic
literature review is a useful and emergent technique for
identifying causality: a PubMed search for systematic
reviews with ‘Bradford Hill’ mentioned in the title or
abstract yielded 28 results, 90% of which were published
in the last 5 years. The limitations of this systematic
review relate mainly to the broad range of studies
included. It was not possible to conduct any kind of
meta-analysis and therefore we do not present a pooled
estimate for the likely effect of MUP on certain out-
comes. The exact effect of any MUP would be influ-
enced by a range of factors, including: the minimum
price level chosen, how broadly it is applied, how
strongly it is enforced and contextual factors such as
affordability (in the UK, alcohol was 54% more afford-
able in 2014 than it was in 198016), other governmental
regulations and the price-level pre-MUP
. Occasionally,
minimum pricing has been implemented as part of a
range of measures,19 and these studies were considered
alongside studies where MUP was implemented in isola-
tion. This emphasises the importance of the specificity
criterion.
There were also challenges with the quality appraisal.
The EPHPP quality assessment tool was used to assess
quantitative studies and the majority of studies were
rated as strong or moderate. However, it was not possible
to appraise two of the studies from the grey literature
using this tool, and there were some challenges assessing
the econometric modelling studies against this frame-
work.
However,
overall
we
think
that
our
quality
appraisal across the different studies is broadly compar-
able. It should also be noted that although a number of
studies were rated as ‘strong’, this is in relation to their
respective study designs and does not reflect the pos-
ition of the study type in the hierarchy of evidence
framework.
This is the first systematic review that has addressed
the effectiveness of minimum alcohol price interven-
tions such as MUP using the Bradford Hill criteria. It
was beyond the scope of this review to study the impact
of generalised increases in alcohol prices (as opposed to
minimum prices). However, where such studies have
been carried out, a minimum price or floor price has
been recommended, for example, in Gruenewald’s 2006
study in Sweden which found that the lowest quality (the
cheapest) alcohol has the highest price elasticity.54
Previous systematic reviews of alcohol price and con-
sumption43 and alcohol-related harm44 have tended to
consider the effect of price increases and increased tax-
ation together. These reviews found significant effects
on consumption and morbidity and mortality. Although
price regulation and taxation are closely related policy
options, evidence from surveys55 and modelling studies45
suggests that the effects of each are different, although
it is known that the majority of tax increases are passed
on as increased prices for consumers.43 56 It was beyond
the scope of this review to discuss whether MUP is
regressive in detail, but as it only affects the prices of the
cheapest drinks, which are usually consumed by the
heaviest
drinkers,
MUP
is
likely
to
narrow
health
inequalities.28

BMJ Open: first published as 10.1136/bmjopen-2016-013497 on 6 June 2017. Downloaded from 
 published in The Lancet examined alcohol control pol-
icies in England and recommended a combination of
MUP and tax increases to reduce alcohol harm and
increase government revenue, rather than either in iso-
lation.57 It is also important to highlight that a consider-
able proportion of included studies were produced by a
small number of research teams. Also, with regards to
the econometric modelling studies, uncertainty in esti-
mates or forecasts is often poorly communicated outside
of the academic literature. The overall risk of bias in the
included studies was minimised by excluding studies
with a conflict of interest (either for or against MUP). It
was not possible to assess publication bias using an ana-
lytical technique such as a funnel plot due to the narra-
tive nature of the review; however, we anticipate that by
including grey literature in this review, we have mitigated
publication bias as far as reasonably possible.
Overall, the findings of this review lend strong support
for policies such as MUP in reducing alcohol consump-
tion and alcohol-related harm, with all nine of the
Bradford Hill criteria met, and little by way of counter
findings. As it is unlikely to be feasible to conduct RCTs
of MUP
, the decision whether or not to introduce MUP
will
not
be
informed
by
a
systematic
review
and
meta-analysis of RCTs, and therefore, this synthesis of evi-
dence according to the Bradford Hill criteria is of value.
Unanswered questions about the effectiveness of MUP
remain; for example, this review has highlighted that
support was moderate or tentative for two of the Bradford
Hill criteria (‘strength of the association’ and ‘experi-
ment’, respectively). There may be opportunities to
explore this in countries such as Scotland if MUP is imple-
mented. If Scotland were to implement MUP
, then it
would be possible to evaluate the validity of the Sheffield
Alcohol Policy Model studies conducted using Scottish
data. It would also be possible to conduct a longitudinal
study to evaluate the effectiveness of MUP in reducing
alcohol consumption and alcohol-related morbidity and
mortality. The findings of this natural experiment would
have relevance elsewhere within and outside the UK.
