Abstract
Purpose: Non–small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) harboring
ALK gene rearrangements (ALKþ) typically become resistant to
the first-generation anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) tyrosine
kinase inhibitor (TKI) crizotinib through development of second-
ary resistance mutations in ALK or disease progression in the
brain. Mutations that confer resistance to second-generation ALK
TKIs ceritinib and alectinib have also been identified. Here, we
report the structure and first comprehensive preclinical evaluation
of the next-generation ALK TKI brigatinib.
Experimental Design: A kinase screen was performed to eval-
uate the selectivity profile of brigatinib. The cellular and in vivo
activities of ALK TKIs were compared using engineered and
cancer-derived cell lines. The brigatinib–ALK co-structure was
determined.
Results: Brigatinib potently inhibits ALK and ROS1, with a high
degree of selectivity over more than 250 kinases. Across a panel of
ALKþ cell lines, brigatinib inhibited native ALK (IC50, 10 nmol/L)
with 12-fold greater potency than crizotinib. Superior efficacy of
brigatinib was also observed in mice with ALKþ tumors implanted
subcutaneously or intracranially. Brigatinib maintained substan-
tial activity against all 17 secondary ALK mutants tested in cellular
assays and exhibited a superior inhibitory profile compared with
crizotinib, ceritinib, and alectinib at clinically achievable concen-
trations. Brigatinib was the only TKI to maintain substantial
activity against the most recalcitrant ALK resistance mutation,
G1202R. The unique, potent, and pan-ALK mutant activity of
brigatinib could be rationalized by structural analyses.
Conclusions: Brigatinib is a highly potent and selective ALK
inhibitor. These findings provide the molecular basis for the
promising activity being observed in ALKþ, crizotinib-resistant
patients with NSCLC being treated with brigatinib in clinical
trials. Clin Cancer Res; 22(22); 5527–38. �2016 AACR.
Introduction
Activating gene rearrangements in anaplastic lymphoma kinase
(ALKþ), first identified in patients with anaplastic large-cell lym-
phoma (ALCL), have been shown to be oncogenic drivers in
patients with non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC; 3%–7%) and
other cancers (1). The ALK/ROS1/MET tyrosine kinase inhibitor
(TKI) crizotinib is highly active in ALKþ NSCLC, inducing
responses in 60% to 74% of patients (2, 3). However, the majority
of patients progress within 1 year [e.g., median progression-free
survival (PFS) is 8–11 months; refs. 2, 3], with multiple mechan-
isms of resistance having been identified.
ALK-dependent mechanisms of resistance, observed in approx-
imately 30% of patients, include the acquisition of secondary
mutations in ALK that interfere with crizotinib binding and/or
amplification of the ALK fusion gene. More than 10 secondary
mutations in ALK have been associated with crizotinib resistance
in patients, with the most common being L1196M and G1269A
(4, 5). The central nervous system (CNS) is the first site of
progression in approximately 50% of patients (6, 7), suggesting
inadequate penetration into the CNS by crizotinib (i.e., pharma-
cologic failure) as the primary cause of resistance in these patients.
Finally, ALK-independent mechanisms, for example, via activa-
tion of EGFR-, IGF-1R-, or KIT-mediated signaling pathways, have
also been shown to contribute to crizotinib resistance (4).
Recently, two second-generation ALK inhibitors, ceritinib and
alectinib, have been approved for use in patients with ALKþ
NSCLC previously treated with crizotinib. In preclinical studies,
ceritinib and alectinib have been shown to inhibit ALK more
potently than crizotinib and to maintain activity against many
of the secondary mutants associated with resistance to crizotinib

 (8, 9). Clinically, ceritinib and alectinib induce responses in 49%
to 58% of patients previously treated with crizotinib, including in
patients with and without secondary ALK mutations (10, 11).
Consistent with the ability of these agents to overcome non–ALK-
dependent mechanisms of resistance, ceritinib and especially
alectinib have been shown to have some activity in patients with
untreated CNS disease (10, 11). Nonetheless, patients tend to
progress even more rapidly than on first-line crizotinib treatment
(median PFS, 6.9–8.9 months; refs. 11, 12), and ALK secondary
mutations associated with clinical resistance have been identified,
including F1174C/V for ceritinib, I1171N/T/S for alectinib, and
G1202R for both agents (4, 8, 13–15).
Brigatinib (AP26113) was developed to be a potent, selec-
tive inhibitor of ALK, capable of overcoming mechanisms of
resistance associated with crizotinib. Brigatinib has been eval-
uated in a phase 1/2 trial (NCT01449461), and a pivotal phase
2 trial of brigatinib is ongoing in patients with ALKþ NSCLC
resistant to crizotinib, randomized to one of two dose sche-
dules [90 mg once daily or 90 mg once daily for 7 days
followed by 180 mg once daily (90 mg and 180 mg once
daily schedules, respectively); NCT02094573]. Here, we pro-
vide the first comprehensive characterization of the design and
preclinical properties of brigatinib.
Materials and Methods
Compounds
Brigatinib (AP26113), crizotinib, ceritinib, and alectinib were
synthesized at ARIAD Pharmaceuticals and purchased [crizotinib
(A Chemtek), ceritinib, and alectinib (Ontario Chemicals)].
Chemical structures of all TKIs (Supplementary Fig. S1) were
confirmed by standard techniques (LC-MS, NMR). Note that a
different molecule has been incorrectly cited as AP26113 in review
articles (e.g., see refs. 1, 16). This incorrect molecule has been
offered by multiple commercial vendors (e.g., Selleck Chemicals;
through May, 2016), and several publications cite such vendors as
the source of the material used in their study (e.g., see refs. 17–20).
Kinase assay
In vitro HotSpotSM kinase profiling of 289 kinases was per-
formed at Reaction Biology Corp. The assay was conducted in the
presence of 10 mmol/L [33P]-ATP, using brigatinib concentrations
ranging from 0.05 nmol/L to 1 mmol/L.
Cell lines
HCC78,H2228,H23,H358,H838,U937,HepG2,andH-4-II-E
cells were obtained from the ATCC. Karpas-299, SU-DHL-1, DEL,
L-82, SUP-M2, and Ba/F3 cells were obtained from the Deutsche
Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen GmbH
(DSMZ) and H3122 cells from the National Cancer Institute
(Bethesda, MD). All cell lines were used within 20 passages of
the initial thaw; no further authentication was performed.
Expression constructs encoding native EML4-ALK (variant 1),
EGFR, ROS1, and FLT3, and mutant variants thereof were
synthesized (Genscript), cloned into a pLVX-IRES puro vector
(Clontech), and introduced into Ba/F3 cells by lentiviral trans-
duction. After selection with puromycin, cells were grown in the
absence of IL3.
In vitro cellular assays
Following TKI treatment for 72 hours, cell growth was assessed
using either CellTiter 96 AQueous One solution (Promega) to
determine the concentration that causes 50% inhibition of cell
viability (IC50) or CyQuant Cell Proliferation assay (Invitrogen)
to determine theconcentration thatcauses 50% growth inhibition
(GI50). The GI50 value was determined by correcting for the cell
count at time zero (initiation of treatment). To evaluate effects on
levels of phosphorylated (p-) proteins, cells were treated with
increasing concentrations of compound for 1 hour and then lysed
in RIPA buffer. Lysates were subjected to p-ALK/total ALK ELISA
(Cell Signaling Technology) and/or immunoblotted using indi-
cated antibodies purchased from Cell Signaling Technology
(p-ALK, total ALK, ROS1, p-ROS1, p-AKT, and pERK1/2). In vitro
cellular assays related to IGF-1R, INSR, and EGFR are described in
the Supplementary Methods.
In vitro mutagenesis screen
Ba/F3 cells expressing native EML4-ALK were treated overnight
with 100 mg/mL N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU; Sigma-Aldrich),
pelleted, resuspended in fresh medium without IL3, and then
distributed into 96-well plates containing various concentrations
of brigatinib, crizotinib, ceritinib, or alectinib. Cells were grown in
standard growth medium without IL3 for 3 to 5 weeks and
monitored for outgrowth of resistant clones. Cells from wells
containing substantial outgrowth were expanded under the orig-
inal selection conditions, gDNA extracted, and the ALK kinase
region sequenced by Taq BigDye Deoxy Terminator Cycle
Sequencing (Applied Biosystems). Results are presented from
two independent screens.
In vivo tumor models
All animal experiments were carried out under a protocol
approved by the ARIAD Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee (IACUC). Tumors were established by subcutaneous
injection of Karpas-299, H2228, or engineered Ba/F3 cells into the
right flank of about 8-week-old CB-17/SCID or SCID beige female
mice (Charles River Laboratory). When the average tumor volume
reached about 200 mm3 (Karpas-299 and Ba/F3 models) or 300
Translational Relevance
Disease progression in patients with anaplastic lymphoma
kinase-positive (ALKþ) non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
treated with the first-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)
crizotinib, or the second-generation inhibitors ceritinib and
alectinib, is often associated with secondary resistance muta-
tions in ALK, or relapse in the brain. Here, we present
the development and preclinical characterization of brigati-
nib, a selective ALK inhibitor with substantially more potent
(�12-fold) activity against ALK than crizotinib, in vitro. Bri-
gatinib inhibits 17 clinically and preclinically observed crizo-
tinib-, ceritinib-, and/or alectinib-resistant ALK mutants tested
in vitro, has potent effects on the recalcitrant G1202R mutant
in vivo, and has activity in an orthotopic brain model. These
results suggest that brigatinib may effectively address a broad
range of resistance mechanisms identified for other ALK TKIs.
Brigatinib is currently being evaluated in a global phase 2
registration trial in patients with locally advanced or metastatic
ALKþ NSCLC who were previously treated with crizotinib
(NCT02094573).

 mm3 (H2228 model), mice were randomized to the various
treatment groups and administered vehicle or TKI once daily by
oral gavage. Mean tumor volumes (length � width2 � 0.5), tumor
growth inhibition, and tumor regression rates were calculated for
each treatment group.
In vivo brain tumor studies
Orthotopic brain tumors were generated by intracranial injec-
tion of H2228 cells into CB-17/SCID mice. Animals were ran-
domized by body weight on day 7 postsurgery, and TKI treatment
was initiated and continued until mice were euthanized, accord-
ing to IACUC guidelines. Median survival time was calculated,
and statistical significance for each survival curve examined using
a log-rank Mantel–Cox test.
Pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic analyses
Tumor samples were lysed in RIPA buffer and subjected to
ELISA or immunoblotting to evaluate pharmacodynamic effects.
TKI concentrations in mouse plasma were assessed using LC/MS-
MS. Plasma samples were deproteinized before analysis, and TKI
levels quantitated using an internal standard LC/MS-MS assay.
Crystallography
A native ALK construct spanning residues 1,093 to 1,407, with
His and GST tags at the N-terminus, was expressed in baculovirus
and Sf9 cells and copurified using affinity and size exclusion
chromatography in the presence of brigatinib. Co-crystals were
generated at 4�C using 0.1 mol/L Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 16% to 18%
PEG3350, and 2 mmol/L TCEP. The atomic coordinates and
structure factors have been deposited in the RCSB PDB (ID:
5J7H). Additional crystallographic analysis–related methods are
described in the Supplementary Methods.
Results
Identification of brigatinib, a potent and selective ALK and
ROS1 inhibitor
To identify a potent ALK inhibitor, a focused chemical library
was screened using in vitro assays, and resulting hits were opti-
mized using structure-based approaches guided by an ALK
homology model. We identified a pyrimidine-based molecule,
brigatinib (AP26113; Fig. 1A), containing a C4 aniline with an
ortho dimethylphosphine oxide (DMPO) substituent. Brigatinib
potently inhibited the in vitro kinase activity of ALK (IC50, 0.6
nmol/L) and all five mutant variants tested, including G1202R
(IC50, 0.6–6.6 nmol/L; Table 1). Brigatinib demonstrated a high
degree of selectivity, only inhibiting 11 additional native or
mutant kinases (of 289 screened) with IC50 <10 nmol/L
(Supplementary Table S1). These included ROS1, FLT3, and
mutant variants of FLT3 (D835Y) and EGFR (L858R; IC50, 1.5–
2.1 nmol/L; Table 1). Brigatinib exhibited more modest activity
against EGFR with a T790M resistance mutation (L858R/T790M),
native EGFR, IGF1R, and INSR (IC50, 29–160 nmol/L) and did not
inhibit MET (IC50 >1000 nmol/L).
The activity of brigatinib against native ALK and a number of
non-ALK kinases was next examined in cellular assays (Table 1).
Consistent with in vitro kinase data, brigatinib inhibited ALK and
ROS1 with similar potencies (IC50, 14 and 18 nmol/L, respec-
tively). Compared with ALK, brigatinib inhibited FLT3 and IGF-
1R with about 11-fold lower potency (IC50, 148–158 nmol/L)
and inhibited mutant variants of FLT3 and EGFR with 15- to 35-
fold lower potency (IC50, 211–489 nmol/L), despite inhibiting
some of these kinases (e.g., FLT3, FLT3 [D835Y], and EGFR
[L858R]) with potency similar to ALK in in vitro kinase assays.
Finally, brigatinib lacked cellular activity against INSR and native
EGFR (IC50 > 3,000 nmol/L). The activity of brigatinib against
non-ALK kinases, including additional mutant variants, is
described in further detail in the Supplement (Supplementary
Results and Supplementary Figs. S2–S4). Overall, these results
suggest that brigatinib is a highly potent and selective ALK and
ROS1 inhibitor.
Brigatinib displays superior in vitro and in vivo potency in ALKþ
ALCL and NSCLC models, compared with crizotinib
In a panel of seven ALCL and NSCLC cell lines that express
NPM-ALK or EML4-ALK fusions, the concentration of brigatinib
that inhibited growth by 50% (GI50) ranged from 4 to 31 nmol/L,
and the concentration that inhibited ALK phosphorylation by
50% (IC50) ranged from 1.5 to 12 nmol/L (Fig. 2A and B). Potent
inhibition of downstream signaling was also observed in both
ALCL and NSCLC cell lines (Supplementary Fig. S5). Across three
ALK-negative ALCL and NSCLC cell lines, the GI50 values for
brigatinib ranged from 503 to 2,387 nmol/L. Thus, overall,
brigatinib potently inhibited ALK activity and proliferation in all
ALKþ cell lines tested and exhibited more than 100-fold selectivity
over ALK-negative lines. In contrast, crizotinib exhibited about
12-fold lower potency compared with brigatinib in ALKþ cell
lines (GI50, 62–309 nmol/L; IC50, 23–55 nmol/L), and only about
10-fold selectivity over ALK-negative lines (GI50, 928–1773
nmol/L; Fig. 2A and B; Supplementary Fig. S5).
The in vivo activity of brigatinib was examined in ALKþ
Karpas-299 (ALCL) and H2228 (NSCLC) xenograft mouse
models, with oral administration of brigatinib (10, 25, or
50 mg/kg once daily) leading to a dose-dependent inhibition
of tumor growth in both models. In the Karpas-299 model,
25 mg/kg inhibited tumor growth by 87% and 50 mg/kg
induced near complete tumor regression that was maintained
for at least 13 days after treatment (Fig. 2C). Increased efficacy
was associated with increased plasma levels of brigatinib and
deeper and more sustained inhibition of ALK signaling in the
tumor (Supplementary Fig. S6A and S6B). A 100 mg/kg daily
dose of crizotinib inhibited tumor growth (by 90%) and ALK
signaling to a similar degree as 25 mg/kg brigatinib, despite
about fivefold higher levels of exposure (Fig. 2C; Supplemen-
tary Fig. S6A and S6C). Comparison of mouse and human
exposure levels (Supplementary Fig. S6C) demonstrated that
plasma levels of brigatinib in mice dosed at 25 and 50 mg/kg
once daily were similar to those achieved in patients dosed at
90 and 180 mg once daily, respectively. Notably, levels of
exposure in mice dosed with 100 mg/kg crizotinib exceeded
those achieved in patients dosed on the approved 250 mg
twice-daily schedule by about sixfold (Supplementary Fig.
S6C). Brigatinib and crizotinib doses used in these studies were
well tolerated (Supplementary Fig. S6D).
H2228-derived tumors, possibly because of theirslower growth
rate, were even more sensitive to ALK inhibition than Karpas-299–
derived tumors, with 10, 25, or 50 mg/kg brigatinib inducing
substantial tumor regression that was maintained for more than
28 days after treatment (Fig. 2C). In this model, 100 mg/kg
crizotinib was required to achieve efficacy similar to that achieved
by 10 mg/kg brigatinib (Fig. 2C). Thus, the substantially greater
potency of brigatinib over crizotinib observed in Karpas-299 and
H2228 cells in cellular assays is also maintained in vivo.

 Brigatinib enhances survival in an orthotopic mouse brain
tumor model, compared with crizotinib
Activity of brigatinib in the CNS was assessed using an ortho-
topic brain tumor model. ALKþ H2228 (NSCLC) cells were
injected intracranially to form tumors in the brain, and tumor-
bearing mice were treated with vehicle, crizotinib, or brigatinib.
Daily oral administration of crizotinib at 100 mg/kg extended
median survival to 47.5 days, compared with 28 days observed in
vehicle-treated mice (Fig. 3A). Compared with crizotinib-treated
mice, daily oral dosing with 25 and 50 mg/kg brigatinib signif-
icantly prolonged median survival to 62 and >64 days [i.e., 10 of
10 mice were alive at study termination (day 64)], respectively
(Fig. 3A). Histologic evaluation demonstrated a significant reduc-
tion in tumor burden in the brains of mice treated with 50 mg/kg
brigatinib compared with crizotinib-treated mice (Fig. 3B and C).
Potent in vitro activity of brigatinib against ALK mutants that
confer resistance to crizotinib, ceritinib, and alectinib
At least 16 unique secondary mutations in ALK, at 11 different
amino acid residues (G1123, T1151, L1152, C1156, I1171,
F1174, L1196, G1202, D1203, S1206, and G1269), have previ-
ously been associated with clinical resistance to crizotinib and/or

 the second-generation ALK inhibitors ceritinib and alectinib (Fig.
4A). To search for novel mutations that might be associated with
resistance to brigatinib, as well as crizotinib, ceritinib, or alectinib,
we performed an in vitro mutagenesis screen. To allow direct
comparison of TKI resistance profiles, a large batch of Ba/F3 cells
expressing EML4-ALK were mutagenized to create a common pool
of mutants, and mutagenized cells were plated in the presence of
graded concentrations of each inhibitor.
Treatment with 500 nmol/L brigatinib was sufficient to sup-
press the emergence of any mutant, whereas higher concentra-
tions of all of the other TKIs (�1,000 nmol/L) were required for
pan-ALK inhibitory activity (Fig. 4A). All clones that survived in
the presence of the next highest brigatinib concentration tested
(200 nmol/L) contained mutations at positions previously
observed to confer resistance to other ALK TKIs (F1174, L1196,
and S1206), except E1210K. In addition, L1198F and V1180L
were identified as mutations that may confer resistance, uniquely,
to ceritinib and alectinib, respectively.
Next, we generated a panel of Ba/F3 cell lines containing native
EML4-ALK, or 17 variants with mutations at all amino acids
(except G1123) that were either previously associated with clin-
ical resistance or identified in the mutagenesis screen (Fig. 4A).
All four TKIs were examined side-by-side, and nonspecific activ-
ities were assessed using untransformed Ba/F3 cells grown in
the presence of IL3 ("parental" cells; Fig. 4B, Supplementary
Fig. S7A). TKI potency was also assessed relative to levels of
exposure achieved in patients at the approved or recommended
phase 2 doses (Fig. 4A).
Brigatinib was the most potent inhibitor of native EML4-ALK
(IC50, 14 nmol/L), with crizotinib, ceritinib, and alectinib all
having lower potency (IC50, 107, 37, and 25 nmol/L, respective-
ly). Brigatinib also demonstrated substantial activity against all 17
ALK mutants (IC50, 9–184 nmol/L), with potencies substantially
greater (range, 2.2- to 77-fold) than those of crizotinib (IC50, 170–
1,109 nmol/L) for all mutants except L1198F. Furthermore,
brigatinib inhibited five mutants with �3-fold greater potency
than ceritinib (range, 3.2- to 40-fold; L1152R/P, C1156Y, L1198F,
and G1269A) and inhibited six mutants with �3-fold greater
potency than alectinib (range, 3.2- to 54-fold; L1152R, I1171N,
V1180L, L1196M, G1202R, and G1269A). Neither ceritinib nor
alectinib had more than twofold greater potency than brigatinib
against any of the 17 mutants tested. Similar trends were observed
when making comparisons based on IC90 values (Supplementary
Fig. S7A), with concentrations required to inhibit native and
mutant EML4-ALK activity by 90% generally about threefold
higher than IC50 values for all four TKIs.
Brigatinib also inhibited native EML4-ALK with the greatest
selectivity over parental Ba/F3 cells (230-fold; based on IC50
values), with crizotinib, ceritinib, and alectinib all having reduced
selectivity (12-, 45-, and 83-fold, respectively; Supplementary Fig.
S7B). In addition, crizotinib exhibited relatively poor selectivity
(�5-fold vs. parental cells) for 11 mutants, all of which involved
residues previously associated with clinical resistance to crizotinib
(T1151Tins, L1152R/P, C1156Y, I1171N, F1174L, F1174V,
L1196M, G1202R, D1203N, and G1269A). Ceritinib exhibited
relatively poor selectivity for four mutants (L1152R/P, L1198F,
and G1202R) and alectinib for three (I1171N, V1180L, and
G1202R). In contrast, brigatinib exhibited more than 17-fold
selectivity for all mutants, with G1202R being the most recalci-
trant (IC50, 184 nmol/L).
Finally, brigatinib also exhibited superior preclinical activity
compared with crizotinib, ceritinib, and alectinib when in vitro
potencies were related to steady-state TKI plasma levels (Cave;
AUC/dosing interval) achieved in patients (Fig. 4A; Supplemen-
tary Fig. S7A). Of the 12 mutants previously associated with
clinical resistance to crizotinib, nine were inhibited with IC90
values that exceed levels reported to be achieved in patients. In
contrast, only two of 12 such mutants were inhibited with IC50
values that exceed plasma levels, suggesting that relating IC90,
instead of IC50, values to plasma levels may better predict clinical
resistance mutations, at least when the potential effects of protein
binding are not taken into account. For ceritinib, IC90 values for
two mutants, L1152R and L1198F, exceeded levels in patients,
whereas for alectinib, IC90 values for three mutants, I1171N,
V1180L, and G1202R, exceeded levels in patients. In contrast,
for brigatinib, levels achieved in patients dosed at 180 mg
exceeded the IC90 for all 17 mutants and levels achieved in
patients dosed at 90 mg exceeded the IC90 for all mutants except

 G1202R. Importantly, the improved potency margin for brigati-
nib is even greater if its relatively low degree of protein binding is
taken into account. The percentage of "free" brigatinib (34.3%),
that is not bound to human plasma proteins in vitro, is four- to
100-fold greater than that of crizotinib (9.3%), ceritinib
(2.8%), and alectinib (0.3%; Fig. 4A).
Taken together, these results demonstrate that brigatinib is a
more potent ALK inhibitor than crizotinib, ceritinib, and alectinib
in vitro and is the only one that exhibits substantial activity against
all 17 secondary ALK mutants tested.

Engineered Ba/F3 cells were next used to explore the in vivo
inhibitory profile of brigatinib and other ALK TKIs against native
EML4-ALK and two ALK mutants of particular interest: L1196M,

 the most common mutant associated with resistance to crizotinib
(4), and G1202R, the mutant brigatinib inhibited least potently
and the only mutant thus far associated with clinical resistance to
crizotinib, ceritinib, and alectinib (Fig. 4A).
Mice bearing subcutaneous tumors expressing native EML4-
ALK or L1196M-mutant EML4-ALK were administered vehicle,
crizotinib, or brigatinib orally once daily. High-dose crizotinib
(200, but not 100 mg/kg) induced regression of tumors expressing
native EML4-ALK but did not show antitumor activity against
L1196M (Fig. 5A; Supplementary Fig. S8A). In contrast, 25 mg/kg
brigatinib induced regression and substantial growth inhibition
of tumors expressing native EML4-ALK and L1196M, respectively,
and 50 mg/kg brigatinib induced tumor regression in both
models. The increased efficacy of brigatinib against L1196M was
associated with deeper and more sustained inhibition of ALK
signaling in the tumor (Fig. 5B; Supplementary Fig. S8A). Cer-
itinib (25 mg/kg) and alectinib (60 mg/kg) have previously been
shown to inhibit growth of tumors expressing L1196M mutant
EML4-ALK (8, 9).
In mice bearing tumors expressing G1202R-mutant EML4-ALK,
25 and 50 mg/kg brigatinib inhibited tumor growth by 55% and
88%, respectively, whereas 100 and 200 mg/kg crizotinib only

Brigatinib markedly enhances survival of mice bearing ALKþ brain tumors compared with crizotinib. A, Kaplan–Meier survival curves of CB17 SCID mice with
intracranial ALKþ H2228 (NSCLC) tumors following treatment with vehicle, crizotinib (100 mg/kg once daily), or brigatinib (25 or 50 mg/kg once daily). Median
survival time and statistical significance (examined using a log-rank Mantel–Cox test) were calculated for each survival curve. �, P < 0.05; ���, P ¼ 0.0002; median
survival was significantly longer in all TKI treatment groups compared with vehicle (P < 0.0001). Injected tumor cells were localized in the brains of all mice
examined; no metastases to other parts of body were observed. Therefore, the survival benefit conferred by TKI treatment was likely due to a reduction of tumor
burden in the brain and not due to a reduction in systemic tumor burden. B, brain tumor pathology score. Tumor score was evaluated on the basis of visual
quantitation of tumor area in hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained sections of brain samples (collected at the time of euthanasia, see Materials and Methods)
by 2 independent reviewers in a blinded manner; an unpaired t test was performed to determine statistical significance. Error bars, SD. Brains analyzed were
harvested on days 32 (n ¼ 1) and 44 (n ¼ 1) for vehicle, 43 (n ¼ 2), 50 (n ¼ 1), 59 (n ¼ 1), and 64 (n ¼ 1) for crizotinib 100 mg/kg, 59 (n ¼ 2) and 64 (n ¼ 2) for brigatinib
25 mg/kg, and 64 (n ¼ 5) for brigatinib 50 mg/kg. Note 3 of 5 mouse brains analyzed in the crizotinib-treated group and all of the mouse brains in the vehicle group
were collected between days 32 and 50, whereas all of the mouse brains analyzed in the brigatinib-treated groups were collected on days 59 or 64. Longer times
until collection could potentially lead to a bias for higher tumor scores for brigatinib-treated mice compared with vehicle- and crizotinib-treated mice. C,

 inhibited tumor growth by 23% and 46%, respectively (Fig. 5A;
Supplementary Fig. S8A). Doses of ceritinib (50 mg/kg) and
alectinib (60 mg/kg) that strongly inhibited growth of native
EML4-ALK tumors (by >95%) had little to no impact on growth of
G1202R tumors (<15% inhibition). The increased efficacy of
brigatinib against G1202R was also associated with deeper and
more sustained inhibition of ALK signaling in the tumor (Fig. 5B).
Pharmacokinetic analysis demonstrated that superior efficacy
of 25 and 50 mg/kg brigatinib was associated with plasma levels
that were similar (within twofold) to those of ceritinib and
alectinib and similar to or below those of crizotinib (Supplemen-
tary Fig. S8A). All dosing regimens used in these studies were well-
tolerated (Supplementary Fig. S8B).
Structural basis for the improved potency of brigatinib
To examine the structural basis for the potent activity of
brigatinib against native ALK and its reduced susceptibility to
ALK mutations (Fig. 4B; Supplementary Fig. S7A), a crystal struc-
ture of the ALK kinase domain in complex with brigatinib was
determined and compared to those of crizotinib, ceritinib, and
alectinib (chemical structures: Supplementary Fig. S1).
Brigatinib is constructed around a bisanilinopyrimidine core
that occupies the ATP-binding site of ALK in a U-shaped confor-
mation (Fig. 1A–C). Brigatinib contains several chemical features
that increase its affinity for ALK that are lacking in crizotinib
(Fig. 1D), including a methoxy substituent, and an extended
solubilization group on the C2 aniline, a chlorine atom at C5,
and a unique DMPO functionality on the C4 aniline. The methoxy
group binds in a pocket located under the hinge residue L1198
and the extended solubilization group fills part of the ribose-
binding pocket and interacts with additional residues from alpha
helix D (e.g., E1210). The chlorine atom at C5 interacts with the
gatekeeper residue L1196. The DMPO moiety interacts with the
small pre-DFG pocket and, to some extent, with the catalytic
lysine (K1150). In addition, because of an intramolecular H-bond
between the DMPO and the C4 aniline NH, brigatinib is more
conformationally preorganized than crizotinib and therefore pays
a reduced entropic penalty during complexation with ALK.
ALK mutations that reduce ceritinib activity to a much greater
degree than brigatinib include L1198F and L1152R/P. While both
compounds share the same bisanilinopyrimidine core and a
chlorine atom at C5, ceritinib has an isopropoxy substituent on
Figure 4.
Brigatinib has reduced susceptibility to ALK mutations compared with other first- and/or second-generation ALK TKIs in vitro. A, left, clinical trial data for ALK
TKIs: steady-state plasma levels (Cave; AUC/dosing interval) at the recommended phase 2 dose, in vitro plasma protein binding (PPB), and ALK mutations

 the C2 aniline and an isopropyl sulfone functionality on the C4
aniline, both of which create unique susceptibilities for ceritinib
(Fig. 1E). For example, while the smaller methoxy substituent of
brigatinib remains largely compatible with mutation of the hinge
residue L1198 to a more bulky phenylalanine, the isopropoxy
substituent of ceritinib does not. In addition, the isopropyl
sulfone functionality on the C4 aniline of ceritinib promotes a
P-loop conformation stabilized via a hydrophobic interaction
between L1152 and F1127, making ceritinib, but not brigatinib,
highly susceptible to mutations that disrupt this interaction.
ALK mutations I1171N and V1180L significantly attenuate
alectinib potency but have more modest (I1171N) or no
(V1180L) effects on brigatinib potency. Comparison of co-crystal
structures reveals that alectinib binds more deeply into the ALK-
binding pocket, in part, through I1171 and V1180 interactions
with a pendant nitrile functionality, whereas brigatinib interacts
minimally with these residues (Fig. 1F). Finally, the G1202R
mutation has a more pronounced effect on alectinib, versus
brigatinib, binding, which is principally due to their different
chemical scaffolds. While this mutation sterically clashes with the
extended solublization groups present on both inhibitors, alecti-
nib, with its rigid tetracyclic core and reduced rotational flexibility,
experiences greater potency loss.
Discussion
Targeted therapies have reshaped the treatment of oncogene-
driven malignancies, including chronic myeloid leukemia (CML),
gastrointestinal stromal tumors, and most recently ALKþ NSCLC.
In most cases, including imatinib for CML and crizotinib for ALKþ
NSCLC, the first TKI approved for these indications had not been
optimized to inhibit the oncogenic driver. Suboptimal target
inhibition likely explains the high susceptibility to both target-
based resistance mechanisms and pharmacologic failure, as next-
generation TKIs have been able to overcome these limitations: for
example, nilotinib, dasatinib, and ponatinib achieve high
response rates in patients with CML who progressed on earlier
lines of therapy, with or without BCR-ABL resistance mutations
(21–23). This TKI evolution is now being recapitulated for ALKþ
NSCLC, with the development of ceritinib and alectinib. An ideal
TKI for a given target would act as a pan-inhibitor, inhibiting all
potential secondary resistance mutations, at clinically achievable
levels (e.g., ponatinib for BCR-ABL; ref. 24), and would also have a
high degree of selectivity for the target, allowing it to have a
favorable safety profile at high levels of exposure necessary to limit
pharmacologic failure.
Here we describe the development and preclinical characteri-
zation of brigatinib, a potent ALK/ROS1 inhibitor designed to
overcome the limitations of crizotinib. Across a panel of eight
ALKþ tumor-derived and engineered cell lines, brigatinib (median
IC50, 10 nmol/L) inhibits ALK with 12-fold greater potency
than crizotinib. This superior potency is also observed in vivo in
multiple xenograft models, including in an orthotopic mouse
brain tumor model in which brigatinib significantly enhanced
survival compared to crizotinib. This could potentially reflect
enhanced CNS penetration by brigatinib or the greater potency
of brigatinib over crizotinib making it less susceptible to phar-
macologic failure in mice.
When evaluating the in vitro potency of TKIs and the potential
therapeutic implications, it is critical to consider these data in the
context of TKI levels achieved in patients at the recommended
dose (25). Possibly due to its high selectivity for ALK (and ROS1),
two kinases with limited expression in adults (26), brigatinib can
achieve levels of exposure in patients that substantially exceed
those required to inhibit native ALK. Total steady-state plasma
levels (Cave) of brigatinib in patients dosed at 90 (582 nmol/L)
and 180 mg (1,447 nmol/L), the two regimens being studied in a
pivotal phase 2 trial, exceed the IC90 for native ALK inhibition by
15- to 38-fold (relating in vitro IC90 values, vs. IC50 values, to total
plasma TKI levels was a better predictor of efficacy). In contrast,
the crizotinib Cave only exceeds the native ALK IC90 by twofold,
suggesting that brigatinib may be much less susceptible to phar-
macologic failure than crizotinib in patients with ALK-driven
cancer.
Perhaps most notably, brigatinib is less susceptible to sec-
ondary resistance mutations in ALK than ceritinib and alectinib,
as well as crizotinib. In an in vitro mutagenesis screen in which
all four TKIs were compared side-by-side, only brigatinib was
able to suppress emergence of any ALK secondary mutant at
500 nmol/L. Using a panel of cell lines containing 17 different
secondary ALK mutations, the inhibitory profile of brigatinib
was found to be superior to that of all three other TKIs. For
example, when comparing absolute IC50 (and IC90) values,
brigatinib had similar or substantially greater potency than
all three TKIs against all 17 mutants (except L1198F compared
with crizotinib). Notably, brigatinib inhibited nine different
mutants with three- to 54-fold greater potency than ceritinib
and/or alectinib. Moreover, the Cave achieved in patients dosed
with 180-mg brigatinib in the phase 1/2 clinical trial exceeds the
IC90 for all 17 mutants (levels at the 90-mg dose exceed all
mutants except G1202R). In contrast, for ceritinib, IC90 values
for two mutants (L1152R and L1198F) exceeded the Cave
observed in patients, whereas for alectinib, IC90 values for three
mutants (I1171N, V1180L, and G1202R) exceeded the Cave.
Importantly, our preclinical studies predict that the higher
potency of brigatinib may be even greater in the clinical setting,
as the percentage of brigatinib not bound to human plasma
proteins in vitro is four- to 100-fold greater than that of crizotinib,
ceritinib, and alectinib. Consistent with this, performing cellular
assays in the presence of physiologic levels of human plasma
proteins leads to a smaller reduction in brigatinib potency
(2.0-fold) compared with crizotinib, ceritinib, and alectinib
(2.7- to 4.0-fold; ref. 27). In addition, in an in vivo assay (in
which effects of protein binding are operative), ceritinib and
alectinib had no effect on growth of a G1202R-mutant tumor,
whereas brigatinib substantially inhibited tumor growth.
Thus, on the basis of a variety of analyses, brigatinib is predicted
to have the broadest spectrum of activity against ALK mutants,
including activity against secondary mutants predicted to confer a
high degree of resistance to ceritinib and/or alectinib, including
L1152R, L1198F, I1171N, V1180L, and G1202R. Thus, while we,
and others (28, 29), have identified mutants that brigatinib
inhibits less potently than native ALK, we predict that when levels
of exposure achieved in patients are taken into account, brigatinib
has the potential to have pan-ALK inhibitory activity such that no
single ALK mutant will be associated with a high degree of
resistance, especially at the higher 180-mg dose level.
Comparison of the brigatinib–ALK costructure to that of cri-
zotinib, ceritinib, and alectinib reveals the molecular interactions
that drive the superior potency of brigatinib and its reduced
susceptibility to secondary mutations. In particular, major unique
mutational liabilities of ceritinib (L1152R/P and L1198F) and

 alectinib (I1171N and V1180L), are shown to result from their
differing molecular structures and interactions with ALK com-
pared with brigatinib. Notably, the dimethylphosphine oxide
moiety present on the C4 aniline of brigatinib is critical for
balancing ALK potency and selectivity over the highly homolo-
gous IGF-1R and INSR kinases (30).
In cellular assays, brigatinib also inhibits the activity of FLT3-
ITD, and variants with certain clinically observed resistance
mutations (D835Y and F691L), with potencies similar to those
against the most recalcitrant ALK mutants. Brigatinib also has
substantial activity against one of the two most common EGFR-
activating mutants (exon 19 deletion; IC90, 314 nmol/L) but
lower potency against EGFR L858R (IC90, 1.2 mmol/L) and
against T790M-containing mutants (IC90 >2 mmol/L). Finally,
brigatinib inhibits ROS1 with potency similar to that of ALK;
therefore, a high degree of ROS1 inhibition and low suscepti-
bility to pharmacologic failure in patients is predicted. Briga-
tinib was shown to maintain substantial activity against ROS1
with a secondary mutation at the gatekeeper residue (L2026M),
although not against the G2032R mutant that has been asso-
ciated with clinical resistance to crizotinib. A phase 2 trial to
evaluate the activity of brigatinib in patients with NSCLC with
ROS1 rearrangements is planned.
The superior potency of brigatinib versus crizotinib observed
in our preclinical studies supports the ongoing testing of
brigatinib in patients with ALKþ patients who have progressed
on crizotinib and suggests several clinically testable hypotheses.
Indeed preliminary results from a phase 1/2 trial have already
shown high objective response rates in this setting, including
in the CNS (31). Our preclinical studies also predict brigatinib
may have activity against most or all mutants that confer
resistance not only to crizotinib, but also to ceritinib and
alectinib; a clinical trial to confirm the preclinical findings of
the ability of brigatinib to overcome ceritinib and alectinib
resistance is planned. These data also suggest that higher doses
(such as 180 mg once daily) should help overcome certain
mutants and may give better CNS penetration. Finally, our data
support testing brigatinib as initial TKI therapy, to see whether
the substantially greater in vitro potency of brigatinib also
manifests as deeper and more durable responses than those
seen with crizotinib and whether emergence of ALK resistance
mutations can be delayed or even circumvented. A phase 3 trial
to compare brigatinib and crizotinib in patients with ALKþ
NSCLC who have not received prior ALK inhibitors is ongoing
(NCT02737501).
