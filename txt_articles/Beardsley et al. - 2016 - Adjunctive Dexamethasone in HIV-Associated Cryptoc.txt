BACKGROUND
Cryptococcal meningitis associated with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) 
infection causes more than 600,000 deaths each year worldwide. Treatment has 
changed little in 20 years, and there are no imminent new anticryptococcal agents. 
The use of adjuvant glucocorticoids reduces mortality among patients with other 
forms of meningitis in some populations, but their use is untested in patients with 
cryptococcal meningitis.
METHODS
In this double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, we recruited adult pa-
tients with HIV-associated cryptococcal meningitis in Vietnam, Thailand, Indonesia, 
Laos, Uganda, and Malawi. All the patients received either dexamethasone or 
placebo for 6 weeks, along with combination antifungal therapy with amphoteri-
cin B and fluconazole.
RESULTS
The trial was stopped for safety reasons after the enrollment of 451 patients. Mortal-
ity was 47% in the dexamethasone group and 41% in the placebo group by 10 weeks 
(hazard ratio in the dexamethasone group, 1.11; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.84 
to 1.47; P 
= 
0.45) and 57% and 49%, respectively, by 6 months (hazard ratio, 1.18; 
95% CI, 0.91 to 1.53; P 
= 
0.20). The percentage of patients with disability at 10 
weeks was higher in the dexamethasone group than in the placebo group, with 
13% versus 25% having a prespecified good outcome (odds ratio, 0.42; 95% CI, 
0.25 to 0.69; P<0.001). Clinical adverse events were more common in the dexa-
methasone group than in the placebo group (667 vs. 494 events, P 
= 
0.01), with 
more patients in the dexamethasone group having grade 3 or 4 infection (48 vs. 
25 patients, P 
= 
0.003), renal events (22 vs. 7, P 
= 
0.004), and cardiac events (8 vs. 0, 
P 
= 
0.004). Fungal clearance in cerebrospinal fluid was slower in the dexametha-
sone group. Results were consistent across Asian and African sites.
CONCLUSIONS
Dexamethasone did not reduce mortality among patients with HIV-associated 
cryptococcal meningitis and was associated with more adverse events and disabil-
ity than was placebo. (Funded by the United Kingdom Department for Interna-
tional Development and others through the Joint Global Health Trials program;

Dexamethasone in HIV-Associated Cryptococcal Meningitis
C
ryptococcal meningitis associated 
with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) 
infection is estimated to cause more than 
600,000 deaths each year, the vast majority in 
sub-Saharan Africa and in South and Southeast 
Asia.1 Among patients receiving combination 
antifungal therapy with amphotericin B and ei-
ther flucytosine or fluconazole, mortality remains 
more than 30% at 10 weeks, and survivors often 
have substantial disability.2,3 There is a pressing 
need to improve outcomes. However, no new 
anticryptococcal agents are currently close to 
approval for clinical use, so innovative strategies 
are needed.
Adjunctive treatments, such as glucocorticoids, 
have shown some benefit in central nervous 
system (CNS) infections in certain settings. For 
example, dexamethasone reduced mortality from 
acute bacterial meningitis among adults in Europe 
and those with microbiologically confirmed dis-
ease in Vietnam.4,5 Dexamethasone reduced mor-
tality in a mixed cohort of HIV-infected and 
uninfected adults with tuberculous meningitis 
in Vietnam, but the study was not powered to 
show an effect in the subgroup of patients with 
HIV infection.6 Cryptococcal meningitis shares 
pathophysiological features with tuberculous 
meningitis, including vasculitis, cerebral edema, 
and raised intracranial pressure,7 all of which 
may be modified by glucocorticoids.
Glucocorticoids are inexpensive and readily 
available in regions in which the burden of cryp-
tococcal meningitis is highest; low rates of ad-
verse events have been observed among patients 
with CNS infections.5,6,8 Retrospective data sug-
gest that glucocorticoids may reduce the risk of 
blindness in HIV-uninfected patients with crypto-
coccal meningitis,9 and studies in animals sug-
gest that the use of such drugs does not reduce 
the sterilizing power of amphotericin or flucon-
azole and improves survival even in the absence 
of antifungal therapy.10,11 Glucocorticoids are 
widely used in clinical practice for cryptococcal 
meningitis in high-burden settings, particularly 
in Asia, and international guidelines recom-
mend their use in some circumstances.12 How-
ever, data from controlled trials are lacking. We 
conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-
controlled trial to determine whether adjunctive 
treatment with dexamethasone would improve 
survival among adults with HIV-associated cryp-
tococcal meningitis.13
Methods
Study Design and Participants
The full details regarding the enrollment pro-
cedures have been described previously13 and 
are provided in the study protocol (available 
with the full text of this article at NEJM.org), 
with study-site information provided in Section 
1 in the Supplementary Appendix, also avail-
able at NEJM.org. In brief, we recruited adult 
patients (≥18 years of age) in 13 hospitals in 
Indonesia, Laos, Thailand, Vietnam, Malawi, 
and Uganda. Eligible patients had HIV infec-
tion, a clinical syndrome consistent with cryp-
tococcal meningitis, and microbiologic confir-
mation of disease, as indicated by one or more 
of the following test results: positive India ink 
staining of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), culture of 
cryptococcus species from CSF or blood, or 
cryptococcal antigen detected in CSF on cryp-
tococcal antigen lateral flow assay (IMMY). We 
excluded patients who were pregnant, had re-
nal failure, had gastrointestinal bleeding, had 
received more than 7 days of anticryptococcal 
antifungal therapy, were already taking gluco-
corticoids, or required glucocorticoid therapy 
for coexisting conditions. Informed written 
consent was obtained from all patients or their 
representatives.
Randomization, Treatment Concealment,  
and Blinding
Randomization in a 1:1 ratio was performed 
with variable block sizes of 4 and 6, with stratifi-
cation according to site. The computer-generated 
randomization list was accessible only to the 
central study pharmacists in Vietnam, who used 
it to prepare blinded, sealed treatment packs 
containing dexamethasone or identical placebo, 
which were distributed to the sites. We used site-
specific enrollment logs to assign patients to the 
next available sequential patient number and 
corresponding treatment pack.
Laboratory Investigations
Lumbar punctures were performed on study days 
1, 3, 7, and 14 and more frequently if clinically 
indicated; quantitative fungal counts14 and CSF 
opening pressures were determined at every 
sampling. The laboratory investigation schedule 
is provided in Section 2 in the Supplementary 
Appendix.

Treatment
Patients received either dexamethasone or iden-
tical placebo for 6 weeks as follows: intravenous 
administration of 0.3 mg per kilogram of body 
weight per day during the first week and 0.2 mg 
per kilogram per day during the second week, 
followed by oral administration of 0.1 mg per 
kilogram per day during the third week, 3 mg 
per day during the fourth week, 2 mg per day 
during the fifth week, and 1 mg per day during 
the sixth week. Patients received antifungal ther-
apy according to international guidelines for 
regions in which flucytosine is unavailable.12 
Induction therapy consisted of amphotericin B 
deoxycholate (Bharat Pharmaceuticals) at a dose 
of 1 mg per kilogram per day and fluconazole 
(Ranbaxy) at a dose of 800 mg per day for 2 weeks, 
followed by consolidation therapy (800 mg of 
fluconazole per day for 8 weeks) and then 
maintenance therapy (200 mg of fluconazole 
per day). The protocol initially recommended 
starting antiretroviral therapy 2 to 4 weeks af-
ter the initiation of antifungal treatment; this 
recommendation was updated to 5 weeks after 
the initiation of antifungal treatment after the 
publication of the results of the Cryptococcal 
Optimal ART (Antiretroviral Therapy) Timing 
(COAT) trial.15 All the patients received daily 
pneumocystis prophylaxis with trimethoprim–
sulfamethoxazole.
Assessment of Outcomes
The primary outcome was survival until 10 weeks 
after randomization. Secondary outcomes were 
survival until 6 months; the level of disability 
at 10 weeks and 6 months, with the outcome 
classified as good, intermediate, poor, or 
death6 (see Section 3 in the Supplementary Ap-
pendix); visual acuity at 10 weeks; the rate of 
decrease in cryptococcal counts in CSF; and 
the change in opening pressure during the first 
2 weeks. We compared the incidence of new 
neurologic events, new acquired immunodefi-
ciency syndrome (AIDS)–defining illness, the 
immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome 
(IRIS), and any other grade 3 or 4 adverse event 
in the two study groups. Adverse events were 
assessed according to definitions in the proto-
col13 and categorized according to the Medical 
Dictionary for Regulatory Activities system organ 
class.16
Ethics and Study Oversight
The study protocol was approved by the institu-
tional review board and regulatory authority at 
each site and by the Oxford University tropical 
research ethics committee. An independent data 
and safety monitoring committee oversaw trial 
safety and analyzed unblinded data after every 50 
deaths, according to its charter (Section 5 in the 
Supplementary Appendix). A trial steering com-
mittee consisting of three independent members, 
two study investigators, and an observer provid-
ed advice on the conduct of the trial. The funding 
bodies and drug manufacturers played no part in 
the study design, implementation, analysis, or 
manuscript preparation. All the authors made 
the decision to submit the manuscript for publi-
cation and vouch for the accuracy and complete-
ness of the data and analyses presented.
Statistical Analysis
Assuming an overall 10-week mortality of at 
least 30%, we determined that we would need to 
enroll at least 880 patients for the trial to have 
80% power to detect a hazard ratio of 0.70 in 
favor of dexamethasone for the primary out-
come, at a two-sided 5% significance level.13 All 
analyses were specified before unblinding, as 
detailed in the protocol13 and the statistical 
analysis plan (Section 4 in the Supplementary 
Appendix). In brief, we used a Cox proportional-
hazards model with stratification according to 
continent to analyze survival in the intention-to-
treat population and prespecified subgroups. 
Since testing on the basis of weighted Schoen-
feld residuals provided clear evidence of nonpro-
portional hazards, we also formally compared 
10-week and 6-month survival probabilities be-
tween the two groups on the basis of Kaplan–
Meier estimation and Greenwood’s formula to 
approximate variance. We used a logistic-regres-
sion model with the study group as the main 
covariate and with adjustment for continent to 
perform a between-group comparison of the 
probability of a good outcome with respect to 
disability status. Log10-transformed longitudi-
nal quantitative measurements of fungal counts 
were modeled by means of a linear mixed- 
effects model, which treated undetectable mea-
surements as left-censored. Statistical analyses 
were performed with the use of R software, 
version 3.1.2.17

Dexamethasone in HIV-Associated Cryptococcal Meningitis
Results
Trial Suspension
Recruitment began in February 2013. In August 
2014, the data and safety monitoring committee 
recommended that the trial be stopped, a deci-
sion that was based on clinical judgment that 
dexamethasone was causing harm across key 
outcomes, including fungal clearance, adverse 
events, and disability outcomes, rather than on 
the basis of a prespecified stopping boundary 
having been crossed with respect to the primary 
outcome. We immediately suspended recruitment, 
and the trial was formally stopped in September 
2014. All the patients completed 6 months of 
follow-up as planned.
At the time of the suspension of the trial, we 
had screened 823 patients and enrolled 451, with 
224 patients assigned to the dexamethasone 
group and 227 assigned to the placebo group 
(Fig. 1). During screening, 42 patients (including 
41 in Asia) had already received more than 24 
hours of glucocorticoid therapy and thus were 
not enrolled. In the intention-to-treat analysis, 
we excluded 1 patient in the placebo group who 
did not receive the assigned intervention be-
cause of a drug-administration error. We ex-
cluded 24 patients from the per-protocol analy-
sis (Fig. 1). All the patients who were enrolled 
in the study received directly observed therapy 
for at least the first 2 weeks of treatment and 
while they were hospitalized. At discharge, all 
the patients received counseling and written 
instructions on the importance of completing 
dexamethasone therapy as prescribed. Out-
patient assessments with medication review 
were performed weekly until 4 weeks and then 
at the completion of week 6 and week 10, un-
less more frequent review was indicated clini-
cally. More than 99% of the planned dexa-
methasone doses were taken, according to this 
review.
Baseline Characteristics
The characteristics of the patients at baseline 
were well balanced between the two study 
groups (Table 1). The Asian and African patients 
differed significantly with respect to some char-
acteristics, including the prevalence of intrave-
nous drug use (18% vs. 0%, P<0.001), cranial-
nerve palsies (19% vs. 6%, P<0.001), visual

impairment (21% vs. 12%, P 
= 
0.02), the median 
CSF fungal load (4.80 vs. 3.83 log10 colony-
forming units per milliliter, P<0.001), and the 
median CD4+ count (16 vs. 26 cells per cubic 
millimeter, P 
= 
0.04). At baseline, Asian patients 
were less likely than African patients to have 
received previous antiretroviral therapy (23% vs. 
55%, P<0.001).
Primary Outcome
The key study outcomes are summarized in 
Table 2. Kaplan–Meier curves for survival up to 
6 months for the whole study population and 
according to continent are shown in Figure 2. By 
10 weeks (the cutoff time for the primary out-
come), 106 of 224 patients (47%) in the dexa-
methasone group and 93 of 226 (41%) in the 
placebo group had died. The intention-to-treat 
analysis showed no significant between-group 
difference in survival at 10 weeks (hazard ratio 
for death in the dexamethasone group, 1.11; 
95% confidence interval [CI], 0.84 to 1.47; 
P 
= 
0.45). However, tests for nonproportional 
hazards were highly significant, which suggest-
ed that the effect of dexamethasone changed 
over time. Therefore, we performed an explor-
atory analysis to determine hazard ratios at 
three discrete periods after randomization. The 
hazard ratios for death were 0.77 (95% CI, 0.54 
to 1.09; P 
= 
0.14) for days 1 to 22, 1.94 (95% CI, 
0.97 to 3.88; P 
= 
0.06) for days 23 through 43, 
and 2.50 (95% CI, 1.23 to 5.05; P 
= 
0.01) for days 
44 to 71 (Section 6 in the Supplementary Ap-
pendix).
Mortality by 6 Months
By 6 months, 128 of 224 patients in the dexa-
methasone group, as compared with 109 of 226 
patients in the placebo group, had died; the as-
sociated Kaplan–Meier mortality estimates were 
57% and 49%, respectively. The prespecified 
Cox regression time-to-event analysis of mortal-
ity did not show a significant between-group 
difference (hazard ratio, 1.18; 95% CI, 0.91 to 
1.53; P 
= 
0.20). However, a formal comparison of 
the risk of death at 6 months showed a trend 
toward harm in the dexamethasone group, with 
an absolute increase in risk of 9 percentage 
points (95% CI, −1 to 18; P 
= 
0.07) in the inten-
tion-to-treat population and of 11 percentage 
points (95% CI, 1 to 20; P 
= 
0.03) in the per-
protocol population.
Disability
Dexamethasone was associated with a signifi-
cantly higher risk of death or disability than was 
placebo at both 10 weeks and 6 months, with 
odds ratios for a good outcome of 0.42 (95% CI, 
0.25 to 0.69; P<0.001) at 10 weeks and 0.49 (95% 
CI, 0.31 to 0.77; P 
= 
0.002) at 6 months. Results 
were consistent across continents (Table 2). The 
prespecified analyses of visual impairment 
among 234 survivors at 10 weeks indicated that 
normal visual acuity was less common among 
those receiving dexamethasone than among those 
receiving placebo (88% [94 of 107 patients] vs. 
96% [122 of 127 patients]; odds ratio, 0.30; 95% 
CI, 0.09 to 0.84; P 
= 
0.02). However, an explor-
atory analysis that excluded the 37 survivors who 
had visual abnormalities at baseline showed no 
significant between-group difference (odds ratio, 
0.51; 95% CI, 0.10 to 2.20; P 
= 
0.37).
Early Fungicidal Activity
Dexamethasone was associated with significantly 
slower rates of decline in the number of crypto-
coccal colony-forming units in CSF than was 
placebo during the first 2 weeks of treatment 
(Fig. 3). The rate of decline per day was −0.21 
log10 colony-forming units per milliliter (95% CI, 
−0.24 to −0.19) in the dexamethasone group 
versus −0.31 log10 colony-forming units per mil-
liliter (95% CI, −0.34 to −0.28) in the placebo 
group (P<0.001) (Table 2). The numbers of pa-
tients with relapse were similar in the two 
groups (5 in the dexamethasone group and 7 in 
the placebo group). A detailed definition of re-
lapse is provided in Section 7 in the Supplemen-
tary Appendix.
Clinical Adverse Events
By 6 months, there were 667 clinical adverse 
events in the dexamethasone group and 494 in 
the placebo group (P 
= 
0.01). A summary of 
adverse events is provided in Table 3, and a 
detailed listing is provided in Section 8 in the 
Supplementary Appendix.
A total of 87 patients in each group had a 
new AIDS-defining illness. However, the rate of 
the combined outcome of a new AIDS-defining 
illness or death by 6 months was higher in the 
dexamethasone group than in the placebo group 
(hazard ratio, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.00 to 1.58; 
P 
= 
0.05). Adverse events that were categorized as 
infections or infestations occurred in 48 patients

Dexamethasone in HIV-Associated Cryptococcal Meningitis
(21%) in the dexamethasone group and in 25 
(11%) in the placebo group (P 
= 
0.003). Patients 
in the dexamethasone group had more adverse 
events than those in the placebo group with re-
spect to gastrointestinal disorders (29 [13%] vs. 
16 [7%], P 
= 
0.04), renal or urinary disorders 
(22 [10%] vs. 7 [3%], P 
= 
0.004), and cardiac dis-
orders (8 [4%] vs. 0, P 
= 
0.004). Gastrointestinal 
bleeding was uncommon, and rates were similar 
in the two groups. There were 19 cases of acute 
renal failure in the dexamethasone group and 
7 in the placebo group; in the dexamethasone 
group, 15 of the 19 cases (79%) occurred during 
an infectious episode. The rates of paradoxical 
IRIS (i.e., clinical deterioration that occurs after 
the initiation of antiretroviral therapy despite a 
microbiologic response to antifungal therapy) at 
10 weeks and 6 months were similar in the two 
study groups. The median time from study entry 
until the initiation of antiretroviral therapy was 
46 days in the dexamethasone group and 42 days 
in the placebo group.
Laboratory Adverse Events
By 6 months, there were 1023 grade 3 or 4 labo-
ratory adverse events in the dexamethasone group 
and 835 in the placebo group (P 
= 
0.02) (Table 3). 
Hyperglycemia, hypercreatinemia, hyperkalemia, 
and hyponatremia all occurred significantly 
more frequently among patients receiving dexa-
methasone than among those receiving placebo.
CSF Opening Pressure
Dexamethasone was associated with a larger 
reduction in CSF opening pressure during the 
first 2 weeks than was placebo. The estimated 
change was −9.2 cm of CSF (95% CI, −11.9 to 
−6.5) in the dexamethasone group and −3.2 cm 
of CSF (95% CI, −5.8 to −0.5) in the placebo 
group (P<0.001) (Table 2).
Subgroup Analyses
Prespecified subgroup analyses showed no sig-
nificant between-group differences in 10-week 
mortality in any of the subgroups — those de-
fined according to continent, country, sex, base-
line score on the Glasgow Coma Scale, anti-
retroviral-therapy status, age, fungal burden, 
CD4+ count, baseline CSF opening pressure, and 
CSF white-cell count. No evidence of heteroge-
neity of effect was seen (Section 9 in the Supple-
mentary Appendix).

Discussion
We set out to test whether adjunctive treatment 
with dexamethasone, initiated at the time of 
diagnosis, would be beneficial for all patients 
with HIV-associated cryptococcal meningitis. We 
found compelling evidence that at the dose and 
regimen used in the study such use was harm-
ful, with significantly increased rates of disabil-
ity and excess severe adverse events, including 
infectious episodes and renal, gastrointestinal, 
and cardiac disorders. The study was stopped 
early because of consistent evidence of harm 
across several outcomes. Consequently, the study 
did not have the statistical power to show an 
effect of dexamethasone on the primary out-
come of mortality at 10 weeks. However, consis-
tent with the evidence of harm, the hazard ratios 
for survival at 10 weeks and 6 months did not 
favor dexamethasone, and a formal between-group 
comparison of the risk of death at 6 months was 
suggestive of harm (P 
= 
0.07) and reached sig-
nificance in the per-protocol analysis (P 
= 
0.03). 
Therefore, it is highly unlikely that dexametha-
sone benefits survival in such patients. The 
consistency of findings across Asian and African 
populations and all prespecified subgroups 
strengthens this conclusion.
We had hypothesized that dexamethasone 
would improve outcomes by reducing intracra-
nial pressure and inflammatory complications 
and by decreasing the incidence of IRIS. The CSF 
opening pressure decreased more rapidly in pa-
tients receiving dexamethasone, but no survival 
benefit was seen, even among patients with in-
creased pressures at baseline. Tests for propor-
tional hazards suggested that the effect of dexa-
methasone may be time-dependent, and our 
exploratory analysis suggested that dexametha-
sone may have benefit during the first 3 weeks 
Figure 2. Survival among All Patients and According to 
Continent.
Shown are Kaplan–Meier survival estimates for all pa-
tients (Panel A) and for those in Africa (Panel B) and 
Asia (Panel C) during the 6 months of follow-up. By  
10 weeks (the cutoff for the primary outcome), 106 of 
224 patients (47%) in the dexamethasone group and 93 
of 226 (41%) in the placebo group had died. At 6 months, 
the estimated risks of death were 57% and 49%, re-
spectively.

Dexamethasone in HIV-Associated Cryptococcal Meningitis
of treatment — a possible reflection of modula-
tion of pressure. A shorter duration of dexa-
methasone might have resulted in a different 
outcome. However, overall, the effects of dexa-
methasone are negative.
IRIS is a difficult management problem in 
cryptococcal meningitis. Current guidelines sug-
gest that the use of glucocorticoids may be bene-
ficial.12,18 Almost 20% of the patients had initi-
ated antiretroviral therapy in the 3 months 
before study entry. It is likely that these patients 
had occult cryptococcal infection that was re-
vealed and worsened by immune reconstitution 
induced by antiretroviral therapy (so-called un-
masking IRIS).19 Even in this subgroup, we 
found no suggestion of benefit with dexametha-
sone therapy. Paradoxical IRIS occurred in 13 
patients, and the study did not have the power 
to detect any effect of dexamethasone on this 
outcome. However, prespecified subgroup analy-
ses for factors that have been associated with an 
increased risk of paradoxical IRIS (low CD4+ 
count, low CSF cellularity, and high CSF fungal 
burden18,20) did not identify a beneficial effect of 
dexamethasone.
It is not clear why dexamethasone was harm-
ful. We chose an administration schedule that 
is routinely used among similarly immunosup-
pressed patients with HIV infection and tuber-
culous meningitis in Vietnam. Among patients 
with tuberculous meningitis, this administration 
schedule is associated with a lower risk of ad-
verse events than that among patients receiving 
placebo.6,21,22 In our study, the dexamethasone 
group had slower rates of decline in cryptococ-
cus counts in CSF than the placebo group, and 
a slower rate of decline has been associated with 
worse outcomes.23 Increased levels of proinflam-
matory cytokines at baseline have been associ-
ated with faster clearance of CSF cryptococcus 
and improved survival. It might be expected that 
cytokine levels would be attenuated by dexa-
methasone.24-26 However, in the dexamethasone 
trial involving patients with tuberculous menin-
gitis, no effect on cytokine levels was seen.27 In 
our study, the increased risk of other acute infec-
tions in the dexamethasone group may have 
contributed to the harm that was observed. Most 
cases of acute renal failure in this group were 
associated with severe infections and were prob-
ably a consequence of sepsis rather than the use 
of dexamethasone.
In conclusion, we tested an adjunctive immune-
modulating treatment for cryptococcal meningi-
tis because of a lack of new antifungal agents 
and the poor performance of those currently 
available. This pragmatic trial was designed to 
determine whether treatment with adjuvant glu-
cocorticoids, started at the point of diagnosis, 
would improve survival among patients with

Listed are the numbers of patients who had at least one adverse event of the respective type. All comparisons are 
based on Fisher’s exact test, except for comparisons of the total number of adverse events, for which the Wilcoxon 
rank-sum test was used to compare the number of events per patient. AIDS denotes acquired immunodeficiency syn-
drome.
†  
The total number of clinical events was 667 in the dexamethasone group and 494 in the placebo group (P = 0.01).

Dexamethasone in HIV-Associated Cryptococcal Meningitis
HIV-associated cryptococcal meningitis. We 
found that it did not. However, even though we 
have shown that a universal approach to the use 
of dexamethasone in patients with HIV-associ-
ated cryptococcal meningitis is harmful, there 
may still be a role for glucocorticoids in such 
patients. Current guidelines recommend the use 
of glucocorticoids among patients who have 
cryptococcomas with mass effect, the acute 
respiratory distress syndrome, or IRIS. These 
events were infrequent in our study. Therefore, 
our study did not have the power to test these 
particular indications, and generating high-
quality evidence to test these indications will be 
difficult. It should be noted that 11% of all the 
patients who were excluded from the study did 
not participate because they had received gluco-
corticoids for CNS disease. Here, we have shown 
that such use is not justified. With no effective 
adjunctive therapy yet identified, improving ac-
cess to the most effective antifungal treatments, 
including flucytosine, must remain a global 
priority.2,3,28,29
