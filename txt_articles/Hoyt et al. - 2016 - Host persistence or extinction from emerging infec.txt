Predicting species’ fates following the introduction of a novel pathogen is a
significant and growing problem in conservation. Comparing disease
dynamics between introduced and endemic regions can offer insight into
which naive hosts will persist or go extinct, with disease acting as a filter
on host communities. We examined four hypothesized mechanisms for
host–pathogen persistence by comparing host infection patterns and
environmental reservoirs for Pseudogymnoascus destructans (the causative
agent of white-nose syndrome) in Asia, an endemic region, and North Amer-
ica, where the pathogen has recently invaded. Although colony sizes of bats
and hibernacula temperatures were very similar, both infection prevalence
and fungal loads were much lower on bats and in the environment in Asia
than North America. These results indicate that transmission intensity and
pathogen growth are lower in Asia, likely due to higher host resistance to
pathogen growth in this endemic region, and not due to host tolerance,
lower transmission due to smaller populations, or lower environmentally
driven pathogen growth rate. Disease filtering also appears to be favouring
initially resistant species in North America. More broadly, determining the
mechanisms allowing species persistence in endemic regions can help ident-
ify species at greater risk of extinction in introduced regions, and determine
the consequences for disease dynamics and host–pathogen coevolution.
1. Introduction
A major outstanding question in evolution and ecology in the Anthropocene is
predicting the state that ecosystems will reach after the introduction of invasive
species, and in particular, novel pathogens [1]. The introduction of novel patho-
gens can have lasting effects on species, communities and ecosystems, but
impacts are extremely variable with some species suffering little mortality
from disease, while others are driven towards extinction [2–6]. Hosts in ende-
mic regions can coexist with these same pathogens through at least four
possible mechanisms: reduced transmission, resistance (host defences that
reduce pathogen growth), tolerance (host defences that reduce damage experi-
enced by the host without reducing pathogen growth) and/or demographic
compensation [7–10]. Inherent host traits, pathogen evolution and the response
of species to the selective pressures of mortality from disease determine the

 outcome of pathogen introductions. Understanding host–
pathogen interactions in endemic regions can offer insight
into both the long-term impacts and potential persistence
mechanisms of naive hosts [11]. For example, finding that
hosts in disease-endemic areas are resistant to a disease
would suggest that phylogenetically and ecologically similar
hosts in invading regions might also persist by evolving
resistance. However, few, if any, studies exist that have
explicitly compared disease dynamics in introduced and
endemic regions.
The mechanisms of host persistence with novel pathogens
also determine, in large part, the intensity of transmission.
Two mechanisms, reduced host density for pathogens in
which transmission is density-dependent, and poor environ-
mental conditions for pathogen survival or replication
outside hosts, will result in lower pathogen transmission
[7,12]. Similarly, if hosts in the introduced region are inher-
ently
resistant
to
the
pathogen
or
evolve
to
become
resistant, then this will limit transmission [9,13]. By contrast,
if hosts are tolerant (or evolve tolerance) then transmission of
the pathogen will be maintained at a much higher intensity,
with correspondingly large impacts on intolerant, non-
resistant species. In this way, diseases ‘filter’ communities
[14], allowing resistant or tolerant species to persist while
more susceptible species are driven extinct.
White-nose syndrome (WNS), a recently emerged disease
of hibernating bats, was first detected in North America in
2006 [15] and has caused precipitous declines in temperate
bat populations across eastern and midwestern North America
[16–18]. The pathogen that causes WNS, Pseudogymnoascus
destructans, is a cold growing fungus that infects bats’ skin
during their hibernation period [19–21], and can persist in
the environment for long periods of time in the absence of
bats [22,23]. The resulting infections lead to the disruption of
homeostatic processes and ultimately mortality [24,25].
Pseudogymnoascus
destructans
has
been
documented
widely across Europe and Asia on multiple species of bats
[26–28]. European isolates of P. destructans are at least as
virulent as the North American strain for North American
bats [20], but the virulence of P. destructans from Asia for
North American bats is unknown. The widespread declines
observed in North America have not been observed in Asia
or Europe [29] and genetic data suggest that P. destructans
has been present in the Old World for millennia [30]. By
understanding how bats persist with P. destructans infections
in endemic regions, we may be able to predict the long-term
disease dynamics in North America. Here, we present the
first comparison of P. destructans infection patterns in intro-
duced and endemic regions and the first data on infection
prevalence and intensity using molecular methods from a
WNS-endemic region.
2. Material and methods
(a) Sample collection and testing
We sampled bats and hibernacula (caves and mines) substrate for
P. destructans at five sites across northeastern Asia and five sites in
North America between 2012 and 2015. The North American sites
were sampled during the first 3 years of pathogen invasion to each
site where populations were experiencing severe declines [16,18].
We selected sites in Asia and North America at similar lati-
tudes to control for climate and winter severity. The average
daily above-ground temperature at the sites in Asia during
winter when sampling was conducted (1 October–30 April
2015) was 0.358C (s.d. ¼ 9.678C) and the average at the North
American sites was 0.538C (s.d. ¼ 10.338C). The number of
days during this period when the temperature was below 108C
(an approximate threshold for flying insect and bat foraging
activity [31]) was similar between regions, averaging 200 days
at Asian sites and 198 at North American sites (an alternate
threshold of 58C produced equivalent results—175 days in Asia
versus 172 days in North America).
Samples were collected using identical methods and during
the same time period (March) in the two regions to make the com-
parison as similar as possible. Past studies indicate that prevalence
and infection intensities (measured as the amount of fungal DNA
detected in a sample) and WNS lesions on bats throughout North
America increased over the winter, and were the highest in late
winter [19,21], making March an ideal sampling time to examine
and compare infection prevalence and fungal growth. In both
regions, we estimated fungal prevalence and infection intensity
(based on the quantity of fungus on the surface of the skin) by rub-
bing sterile swabs on bats’ wings and muzzles as previously
described [19,32,33]. We also swabbed areas of cave/mine sur-
faces directly under and 10 cm from the swabbed bat to
determine the extent of the environmental reservoir. We stored
samples in RNAlater prior to testing. We extracted DNA from
samples using a modified Qiagen DNeasy blood and tissue kit
(Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) [19] and tested for the presence of
P. destructans using quantitative PCR [34]. All samples were run
in duplicate, with quantification standards on each plate and 16
negative controls per plate. All quantification standards were
within a consistent range and all negative controls had no
fungal detection. We also surveyed a subset of bats’ wing and
tail membranes for orange fluorescence using an ultraviolet
(UV) flashlight (395 nm; Hayward, CA, USA). The presence of
orange fluorescence on wing and tail membranes under UV
light has been shown to be correlated with the presence of lesions
in infected bats [35].
We measured the temperature next to the swabbed hibernat-
ing bat using a laser temperature thermometer (Fluke 62 MAX
Plus Infrared Thermometer) that was calibrated across a range
of surfaces and temperatures from 08C to 208C using a factory cali-
brated

logger
(model
U23–001).
We
confirmed that these single time point measurements of tempera-
tures

accurately
represent
winter
hibernacula temperatures; point estimates of temperature (mean
per site ¼ 41; range 24–105) at 11 sites in the Midwestern USA
were very tightly correlated with winter temperatures measured
every 3 h from 1 December–31 March using HOBO temperature
loggers (r ¼ 0.95; n ¼ 11; p , 0.00001).
At each site, we estimated colony size by counting all individ-
uals of each species. Hibernating bats roosted on cave and mine
surfaces making near complete counts of individuals possible.
(b) Statistical analysis
We used generalized linear mixed-effects models with continent
as a fixed effect, and species and site as random effects to make
comparisons of P. destructans prevalence and loads on bats and in
the environment using binomial and Gaussian distributions,
respectively. We controlled for temperature and colony size by
including these variables as fixed effects in the models. We
also examined variation in prevalence and load among species
by modelling species as a fixed effect. We used the R package
brglm to compare prevalence among species with species, temp-
erature and log10 colony size as fixed effects. We used Tukey’s
post-hoc HSD test to compare pairs of species. To compare
environmental prevalence and loads, we used generalized
linear mixed-effects models with sample type (under the bat or
rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org
Proc. R. Soc. B 283: 20152861
2
 10 cm from the bat) as a fixed effect, and site as a random effect.
We standardized roosting temperatures by fitting a mixed-effects
model with site as a random effect, and season (early or late
hibernation) as a categorical fixed effect because temperatures
of hibernation sites were colder as winter progressed and data
at all sites was not collected at identical times. We then compared
adjusted mean late hibernation site temperatures using a t-test.
We compared colony sizes among continents using a generalized
linear mixed-effects model with Poisson distribution and log link,
with site and species as random effects and continent as a fixed
effect. All analyses were run in R, v. 3.0.2, and mixed-effects
models were fit using the lme4 package.
3. Results
Colony sizes and hibernacula environments were very similar
between
the
two
continents
(electronic
supplementary
material, table S1). Colony sizes for individual species
ranged from 19 to 3154 bats per hibernaculum and were
not significantly different among continents (figure 1; coeff:
0.64+ 1.54, Z ¼ 0.42, p ¼ 0.68). Hibernacula temperatures
were
also
very
similar
in
Asia
and
North
America
(figure 2a; t-test of site means: t ¼ 20.76, d.f. ¼ 8, p ¼ 0.47).
Prevalence of P. destructans on bats across all sites and
species was significantly lower in Asia than on the invasion
front in North America (figures 2a and 3; N ¼ 337, continent
coeff.: 24.70 +1.44, t ¼ 3.3, p , 0.001) and neither tempera-
ture
nor
colony
size
were
significant
predictors
of
prevalence in this analysis (temperature coeff.: 0.13+ 0.14;
t ¼ 0.93; p ¼ 0.36; log10 colony size coeff.: 20.17+0.51, t ¼
0.33, p ¼ 0.74). Prevalence in late winter on all five species
of bats in North America was more than 95%, whereas preva-
lence in late winter on four species of bats in Asia averaged
51% (figure 3a). Infection intensity, measured as fungal
loads on bats’ wings and muzzles, was significantly lower

 There were significant differences in fungal loads among
species, but all species in Asia were statistically significantly
lower than all North American species (figure 3b). The
most heavily infected species in Asia, Myotis petax, had
loads that were twofold lower than the species with the
lowest infection intensity in North America, Eptesicus fuscus
(figure 3b). At the extreme, the species with the lowest
infection intensity, Rhinolophus ferrumequinum, had loads
that were 1000-fold lower than the average load of North
American species.
We found that, on average, 28% of 124 bats in China
(range among species: 2–73%), showed orange UV fluor-
escence consistent with the presence of skin lesions due to
P. destructans infection, whereas the prevalence of UV
orange fluorescence in North America was higher (75% of
127 bats; range 38–100%; species random effect s.d.: 2.2; con-
tinent coeff: 24.5+1.8; Z ¼22.5; p ¼ 0.01). This difference
was likely partly related to the differences in fungal load
(figure 3b), because the probability of UV orange fluorescence
increased with fungal infection intensity (generalized linear
model with binomial distribution and logit link: coeff:
0.93+ 0.28,
d.f. ¼ 262;
p ¼ 0.01),
and
the
difference
in
orange UV fluorescence among continents was not significant
after accounting for differences in fungal loads (coeff:
20.79 +0.51, d.f. ¼ 262; p ¼ 0.13).
Spatial variation in prevalence within each continent
was much higher in Asia than North America (figure 1;
Kruskal–Wallis p ¼ 0.001), despite sampling from a narrower
geographical region. For all five species sampled in North
America, prevalence was uniformly high (95–100% for all
species at all sites). By contrast, prevalence varied from 40
to 100% in Murina leucogaster, and 0–67% in R. ferrumequinum
across sites (figure 1). Similarly, median fungal loads were
almost uniformly high across sites in North American bats,
including Myotis lucifugus (1021.5–1020.5 ng), and P. subflavus
(1022–1021.5 ng), whereas loads were highly variable for bats
in Asia, with median loads for both Mu. leucogaster, and
R.
ferrumequinum
spanning
two
orders
of
magnitude
(figure 3).
Finally, environmental prevalence, while highly variable
among sites in Asia, was significantly lower in Asia than
North America (figure 4a; N ¼ 198, coeff: 21.58+ 0.79,
Z ¼ 22.0, p ¼ 0.045). Pseudogymnoascus destructans fungal
loads on substrates were also significantly lower in Asia
(figure 4b; N ¼ 131, coeff: 21.4+0.62, t ¼ 22.24, p ¼ 0.01).
4. Discussion
Disease can drive population cycles, cause extinctions that
re-structure communities, and create continental-scale differ-
ences in abundance [17,37,38]. WNS has had devastating
effects on bat populations across eastern and midwestern
North America, with dozens of populations being extirpated
and several species predicted to be driven extinct [16–18]. By
contrast, although P. destructans is widespread in Europe and
Asia, bat species have likely persisted with this pathogen for
millennia [26,28,30].
We found that prevalence, the presence of UV orange flu-
orescence, and infection intensity of P. destructans was much
lower on bats in Asia than on bats at invasion sites in North
America, and that the environmental reservoir was less exten-
sive in Asia as well. These data are consistent with Asian bats
having higher resistance to pathogen growth, and are incon-
sistent with three other mechanisms that can lead to
coexistence of hosts with an initially virulent pathogen: toler-
ance, reduced transmission because of smaller population
size and lower pathogen growth rate because of lower temp-
eratures. If tolerance, alone, was the mechanism allowing
persistence of Asian bat populations with P. destructans,
then prevalence and infection intensity would be similar on
bats in both continents [9]. Colony sizes in Asia and North
America were broadly overlapping, and differences among
continents in prevalence and infection intensity were still
highly significant in analyses that included colony size.
Thus, the data are inconsistent with reduced transmission
in Asia being due to smaller colony sizes and reduced
density-dependent
transmission.
Similarly,
hibernacula
temperatures (as well as winter severity) were very similar
between sites in Asia and North America and, as analyses
indicated that the lower fungal loads of P. destructans on
bats and hibernacula substrate in Asia cannot be attributed
to cooler environmental conditions.
We found that the environmental reservoir was lower in
Asia than North America, which is consistent with overall
lower
transmission
intensity and
reduced
shedding
of
P. destructans by resistant bats in Asia. Lower transmission
intensity, as well as differences in hibernation behaviour
and phenology may have contributed to the higher variabil-
ity in prevalence and infection intensity in Asian bats
compared with North American bats. In addition, the
higher prevalence and infection intensity in North American
bats is not simply a transient phenomenon associated with
the spreading wavefront of P. destructans, because both preva-
lence and infection intensity has been shown to remain high

 at sites several years after populations had declined [19].
Fungal loads were much lower on Asian bats, resulting in a
lower probability of WNS lesions, measured by UV flor-
escence. For some bat species in Asia with especially low
fungal loads (e.g. R. ferrumequinum), the fungus may be pre-
sent only on the surface of their skin and only rarely causing
invasion
and
pathology.
However,
the
absence
of
P. destructans detection on non-hibernating R. ferrumequinum
bats during the summer at some of these same sites [28]
suggests that our winter estimates of prevalence and infection
intensity do not simply represent surface contamination, and
the presence of detectable amounts of fungus suggests that
these bats are likely infectious to other individuals and the
environment.
Our data show that while there are significant differences
in infection intensity between North America and Asia, there
is also substantial variation in infection intensity among indi-
viduals within most species in North America, and these data
may offer insight into which species are at greater risk of
extinction than others. Eptesicus fuscus and Myotis sodalis
have a relatively large fraction of individuals with fungal
loads similar to Asian bats, and thus are unlikely to be
driven extinct by WNS. By contrast, loads on Myotis septen-
trionalis were high, with most individuals having loads
higher than bats in Asia. Two other species, My. lucifugus
and P. subflavus, have populations that include many individ-
uals with high loads, but a small fraction of these species at
some sites have lower infection intensities, similar to those
of bats in Asia. Thus, these species would be predicted to
suffer large declines from WNS, but some individuals
should be able to persist with the fungus.
These predictions are consistent with patterns of initial
declines of these species reported previously [17,18]. Specifi-
cally, My. septentrionalis populations have been extirpated
from most sites where WNS has been present for 3 or more
years [17,18] whereas, My. lucifugus and P. subflavus popu-
lations have declined more than 90%, but have stabilized at
much smaller sizes in some colonies [18]. Finally, as would
be predicted based on their low infection intensity, colonies
of My. sodalis and E. fuscus suffered much lower declines
from WNS.
The traits conferring resistance in Asian bats and some
species and individuals of North American bats are yet to be
identified.
They
may
include
differences
in
microbial
communities on bats [39], or increased immune function,
although differences in antibodies do not appear to be important
[40]. The smaller environmental reservoir in Asiacould be due to
the presence of natural enemies (e.g. mycoviruses or nematodes)
that are not present or less abundant in North America.
The extent of declines in multiple species and the pres-
ence of both environmental and biological reservoirs of
P. destructans [16,19], result in intense and persistent selective
pressure on North American bats. It remains to be seen if the
speed of evolution will be rapid enough to prevent extinc-
tions of the most heavily impacted species [2,6,8,38,41,42].
Management actions to conserve these species face the
challenge of reducing disease impacts to prevent extinction
without compromising species’ evolutionary response to
this and other diseases.
