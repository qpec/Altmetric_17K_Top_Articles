Poison ivy-induced allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) is the most
common environmental allergic condition in the United States. Case
numbers of poison ivy ACD are increasing due to growing biomass
and geographical expansion of poison ivy and increasing content of
the allergen, urushiol, likely attributable to rising atmospheric CO2.
Severe and treatment-resistant itch is the major complaint of af-
fected patients. However, because of limited clinical data and poorly
characterized models, the pruritic mechanisms in poison ivy ACD
remain unknown. Here, we aim to identify the mechanisms of itch
in a mouse model of poison ivy ACD by transcriptomics, neuronal
imaging, and behavioral analysis. Using transcriptome microarray
analysis, we identified IL-33 as a key cytokine up-regulated in the
inflamed skin of urushiol-challenged mice. We further found that
the IL-33 receptor, ST2, is expressed in small to medium-sized dorsal
root ganglion (DRG) neurons, including neurons that innervate the
skin. IL-33 induces Ca2+ influx into a subset of DRG neurons through
neuronal ST2. Neutralizing antibodies against IL-33 or ST2 reduced
scratching behavior and skin inflammation in urushiol-challenged
mice. Injection of IL-33 into urushiol-challenged skin rapidly exacer-
bated itch-related scratching via ST2, in a histamine-independent
manner. Targeted silencing of neuronal ST2 expression by intrathecal
ST2 siRNA delivery significantly attenuated pruritic responses caused
by urushiol-induced ACD. These results indicate that IL-33/ST2 signal-
ing is functionally present in primary sensory neurons and contrib-
utes to pruritus in poison ivy ACD. Blocking IL-33/ST2 signaling may
represent a therapeutic approach to ameliorate itch and skin inflam-
mation related to poison ivy ACD.

A
llergic contact dermatitis (ACD) is a common allergic skin
condition caused by environmental or occupational aller-
gens (1). In the United States, the most common cause of ACD
is contact with poison ivy, which affects >10 million Americans
per year (2, 3). Poison ivy ACD is also a serious occupational
hazard, particularly among firefighters, forestry workers, and
farmers, accounting for 10% of total U.S. Forest Services lost-
time injuries, and it often torments outdoor enthusiasts as well
(3, 4). The major allergen in poison ivy is urushiol, contained in
the oleoresinous sap of the plant and of related plants (e.g.,
poison oak and poison sumac) (5). An estimated 50–75%
of Americans are sensitized to urushiol (6). Elevated atmo-
spheric carbon dioxide and warming temperatures have in-
creased the biomass of poison ivy and related plants, widened
their geographic distribution, and increased plant urushiol
content (7). These factors will likely increase allergenicity and
result in even larger case numbers of poison ivy ACD in the
future (8).
The clinical manifestations of poison ivy-induced ACD are in-
tense and persistent itch (pruritus), burning sensation, skin rashes,
and swelling, followed by the appearance of vesicles in severe cases
(2, 3, 9). Skin inflammation and pruritus last for weeks. The severe
itch usually triggers scratching that is hard to control, especially
among children, and further injures the skin (10). Scratching exac-
erbates the inflammation and stimulates nerve fibers, leading to
even more itch and scratching. This itch–scratch cycle can cause skin
infections that require antibiotic treatment. Antihistamines are
usually ineffective for treating pruritus associated with poison ivy
ACD, although they are still commonly used (2, 11). Patients with
severe symptoms are treated with high-dose corticosteroid regi-
mens, which frequently have side effects and are effective only if
administered shortly after exposure.
The pruritic mechanisms in poison ivy ACD remain largely un-
known because of very limited clinical data and poorly characterized
animal models. Itch signals are generated by a subset of primary af-
ferent sensory neurons that innervate the skin (12). Recent studies
using rodent models of pruritic conditions identified a range of non-
histaminergic endogenous itch mediators acting on sensory neurons
and neuronal receptor systems signaling itch. These include cytokines
such as IL-31, CXCL-10, or TSLP (thymic stromal lymphopoietin);
transmitters such as serotonin; and their cognate receptors and cou-
pled ion channels (13–15). These studies used either chemicals elic-
iting acute itch (such as chloroquine) or ACD rodent models induced
by synthetic allergens not present in the environment [2,4-dinitro-
fluorobenzene (DNFB) oxazolone, and others] (14, 16–18).
We contributed to these efforts, identifying the ion channel
TRPA1 (transient receptor potential ankyrin 1) as a key target to
Significance
In the United States, the most common cause of allergic con-
tact dermatitis (ACD) is contact with poison ivy. Severe itch and
skin inflammation are the major manifestations of poison ivy-
induced ACD. In this study, we have established a critical role
of IL-33/ST2 (interleukin 33/growth stimulation expressed gene
2) signaling in both itch and skin inflammation of poison ivy-
induced ACD and revealed a previously unidentified interaction
of IL-33/ST2 signaling with primary sensory neurons that may
underlie the pruritic mechanisms of poison ivy-induced ACD.
Blocking IL-33/ST2 signaling may represent a therapeutic ap-
proach to ameliorate itch and skin inflammation related to poi-
son ivy dermatitis and, possibly, other chronic itch conditions in
which IL-33/ST2 signaling may participate.

 suppress itch in a mouse ACD model induced by the synthetic
allergen oxazolone (16). To examine whether these pathways
also contribute to itch in poison ivy ACD, we established a
mouse model induced by cutaneous sensitization and challenge
with urushiol. This model mimics many key clinical features of
poison ivy-induced ACD, including skin inflammation and severe
itch (16). TRPA1 inhibition was less efficacious in this model,
suggesting that poison ivy ACD engages as-yet-unknown in-
flammatory and pruritic pathways (16).
The aim of the present study is to reveal these pathways through
an unbiased approach by using transcriptome microarray analysis
of urushiol-induced genes in the mouse skin, validation by quan-
titative PCR (qPCR) and biochemistry, neuronal functional im-
aging, and pharmacological and behavioral testing.
Results
Urushiol-Induced ACD Triggers the Release of IL-33 from the Inflamed
Skin. To search for potential endogenous pruritogens involved in
the pruritus caused by urushiol-induced ACD, we carried out a
mouse transcriptome microarray analysis to study gene expression
profiles of the skin isolated from urushiol-challenged and un-
challenged (acetone-treated) mice. For comparison, we included
the well-established oxazolone-induced ACD mouse model. Mice
were sensitized with 2.0% (wt/vol) oxazolone or urushiol on the
abdominal skin, followed by challenges on the nape of neck 5 d
later with 0.5% oxazolone or urushiol, a concentration known to
elicit ACD in sensitized humans (Fig. 1A) (19). We found that,
during the third and fifth urushiol challenge, mice usually de-
veloped a stable dermatitis condition and long-lasting scratching
toward the neck. Therefore, mouse neck skin samples were col-
lected after the fifth challenge. Total RNA from neck skins of
unchallenged mice and from the mice that had received urushiol or
oxazolone treatment were analyzed by using hybridization with a
mouse transcriptome microarray. A total of 3,612 genes, which
represents 5.5% of total genes (65,956), was identified to be sig-
nificantly up- or down-regulated (greater than twofold; P < 0.05) in
mouse skin upon urushiol treatment (Tables S1 and S2). Among
these differentially regulated genes, we were especially interested in
inflammatory cytokines and chemokines that are abundantly up-
regulated. Fig. 1B illustrates the top 15 inflammatory cytokines and
chemokines that are significantly up-regulated. Among these genes,
some well-established inflammatory markers, such as IL-1β and
CXCL-2, were highly up-regulated in both the oxazolone and uru-
shiol groups. Of particular interest was cytokine IL-33, which was
significantly up-regulated in both oxazolone- and urushiol-treated
groups. IL-33 has not previously been implicated in itch, but neu-
tralizing antibodies against IL-33 were shown to attenuate skin
swelling in a mouse ACD model and in humans (20, 21). IL-33
expression is also enhanced in human ACD skin (21). More im-
portantly, skin-specific expression of IL-33 can elicit atopic der-
matitis-like inflammation and scratching behavior in mice (22). In
the present study, we therefore investigated the possible involve-
ment of this cytokine in itch caused by poison ivy ACD.
qPCR analysis confirmed that IL-33 transcription was signifi-
cantly up-regulated in both oxazolone- and urushiol-treated
groups compared with acetone (Fig. 1C). ELISA confirmed a
corresponding increase in IL-33 protein levels in the inflamed
skin, but not in plasma (Fig. 1 D and E). Finally, increased levels
of IL-33 were detected in mouse skin sections from both oxa-
zolone- and urushiol-treated groups by immunofluorescence
staining (Fig. 1 F and G). Immunofluorescence further revealed
that IL-33 was extensively expressed in cells localized in the
epidermis of skin (Fig. 1F). Double immunofluorescence stain-
ing showed that IL-33–positive cells closely overlap with cells
stained with keratin 14, a specific marker for keratinocytes (Fig.
1H). We conclude that IL-33 is significantly increased in the
inflamed skin in urushiol-induced ACD mice because of in-
creased production and release from keratinocytes.
IL-33–Specific Receptor ST2 Is Expressed in Peripheral Sensory Neurons.
Although numerous studies have shown that IL-33 acts on immune
cells, IL-33 signaling in peripheral sensory neurons has not been
reported. IL-33 signals through the IL-33 receptor complex, a het-
erodimer consisting of the accessory chain IL-1 receptor-like 1
(IL-1RAcP) and a membrane-bound IL-33–specific ST2 chain (23).

 We detected both ST2 and IL-1RAcP transcripts in human and
mouse dorsal root ganglia (DRGs) by using qPCR (Fig. 2 A and B).
Immunofluorescence staining further showed that ST2 was expressed
by 34.3% of DRG neurons of mouse (218 of 636 neurons), mainly in
small and medium-sized neurons (Fig. 2 C and D). The specificity of
ST2 antibody was confirmed by negative control staining without first
antibody (Fig. 2C), and staining with first antibody preabsorbed with
a blocking peptide with the ST2-derived antigenic sequence (Fig. S1
A and B).
Itch is mediated by a subset of peripheral cutaneous sensory
neurons (12). To study the expression of ST2 in the cutaneous
sensory neurons, we used retrograde labeling dye Fast Blue
to specifically label skin-innervating DRG neurons. This ap-
proach revealed that ST2 is expressed in skin-innervating DRG
neurons, with 8.3% of ST2-expressing neurons labeled with
Fast Blue (Fig. 2E, white arrow). Immunofluorescence analysis
identified ST2 costaining with IL-1RAcP and TRPV1, but not
with GS, a marker for satellite glial cells (Fig. S2A). A total of
21.5% of ST2 immunoreactive neurons showed IL-1RAcP staining
and 57.1% showed TRPV1 costaining. We also identified cos-
taining of ST2 with PGP9.5-positive free nerve endings in skin
sections (Fig. S2B).
IL-33 Produces Ca2+ Responses in DRG Neurons Through Its Receptor
ST2. We proceeded to explore whether ST2 receptors are func-
tional in DRG neurons by testing the effects of IL-33 on in-
tracellular Ca2+ mobilization of cultured cervical DRG neurons
(C1-T1). In our initial experiments, we observed that IL-33 pro-
duced Ca2+ responses in neurons dissociated from both control
and urushiol-challenged mice, with larger numbers of neurons
responding in the latter amounting to 12.0 ± 1.3% of total KCl-
responsive (KCl+) neurons (Fig. 3 A–D). Chloroquine (CQ), a
well-established pruritogen that causes itch via MrgA3 in DRG
neurons (17), was applied after IL-33 to determine whether these
populations overlap. Representative patterns of Ca2+ responses
of these neurons are shown in Fig. 3B. Venn diagram analysis
revealed that 51.9% of IL-33–responsive neurons also responded
to CQ (Fig. 3C). In addition, 75.0% of IL-33–responsive neurons
also responded to histamine (Fig. 3C). We found that 67.6% and
85.3% of IL-33–responsive neurons are activated by mustard oil
(MO) and capsaicin (Cap), respectively (Fig. 3 B and C). In sum-
mary, Ca2+ imaging revealed that IL-33 induces robust Ca2+ re-
sponses in a subset of DRG neurons that also mediate pain and/or
itch responses.

 the percentage of IL-33–responsive neurons, suggesting that TRP
ion channels may be acting downstream of IL-33 pathways (Fig. 3D).
A TRPA1-specific blocker, HC-030031, and a TRPV1-specific
blocker, AMG9810, both significantly reduced IL-33 responses
(Fig. 3D). Coadministration of HC-030031 and AMG9810 further
reduced the percentage of IL-33–responsive neurons (Fig. 3D).
Pretreating neurons with a ST2-specific monoclonal neutralizing
antibody also significantly reduced the percentage of IL-33–
responsive neurons (Fig. 3D). Together, these results demonstrate
that the IL-33–induced Ca2+ response in DRG neurons is
largely mediated by TRP-like channels, possibly TRPA1 and
TRPV1, downstream of neuronal ST2 receptors.
IL-33/ST2 Signaling Mediates Chronic Scratching Behavior and Skin
Inflammation in Urushiol-Challenged Mice. To determine whether
IL-33 was involved in the chronic scratching behavior associated
with urushiol-induced ACD, we examined the effects of an IL-
33–neutralizing antibody on scratching behavior of mice after the
third urushiol challenge. Urushiol-challenged mice were ad-
ministered i.p. either the IL-33–neutralizing antibody (15 μg per
mouse, i.p.) or an isotype control IgG (goat IgG = Iso IgG(1),
15 μg per mouse, i.p.) daily, starting from day 0 until day 4 (Fig.
4A). Unchallenged mice (acetone-treated) received isotype con-
trol IgGs (i.p.) only. IL-33–neutralizing antibody significantly re-
duced the scratching behavior of mice at the 0-, 4-, and 24-h time
points (Fig. 4B). We continued to examine whether ST2 was also
involved in the scratching behaviors of mice in urushiol-induced
ACD. ST2-neutralizing antibody (50 μg per mouse, i.p.) or iso-
type control IgG (rat IgG = Iso IgG(2), 50 μg per mouse, i.p.)
were administered i.p. to urushiol-challenged mice in a similar
treatment regimen (Fig. 4A). ST2-neutralizing antibody signifi-
cantly reduced the scratching behavior of mice at the 0-, 4-, and
24-h time points (Fig. 4C). In addition, IL-33– and ST2-neutralizing
antibodies did not affect motor coordination behavior in the
mouse rotarod assay (Fig. 4D).
We proceeded to examine the effects of IL-33– and ST2-neu-
tralizing antibody treatment on skin inflammation. Consistent with
our previous observation (16), sensitization and challenge of the
mouse neck skin with urushiol produced a strong increase in skin
bifold thickness, transepidermal water loss (TEWL), and dermatitis
score (Fig. S3). Daily treatment with IL-33– or ST2-neutralizing
antibodies produced a modest, although significant, reduction in skin
bifold thickness (Fig. S3 A and B). In addition, antibody treatment
significantly reduced the TEWL and dermatitis score associated
with ACD (Fig. S3 C and D). Collectively, these findings support
the hypothesis that IL-33/ST2 signaling is involved in chronic
scratching behavior and skin inflammation of urushiol-induced
mouse ACD.
Exogenous IL-33 Exacerbates Itch-Related Scratching Behaviors and
Skin Inflammation in Urushiol-Induced ACD Mice. To gain further
insights into the role of IL-33 in chronic itch, we examined the
potential behavioral effects of IL-33 in urushiol-induced mouse
ACD. Right after the third urushiol challenge of the neck skin, a
single dose of IL-33 [300 ng per site, intradermally (i.d.)] or PBS
was injected into the nape of the neck (Fig. 5A). As expected,
urushiol-challenged mice showed scratching behavior compared
with acetone-treated controls (Fig. 5 B and C). Notably, we
observed that IL-33 injection robustly enhanced the scratching
behaviors in the urushiol-challenged mice at both the 0- and 4-h
time points (Fig. 5 B–D). Two-way ANOVA analysis indicated
significant differences between the IL-33– and vehicle-injected
groups (Fig. 5 B and C). IL-33 began to take effect within 5 min
after the injection, indicating a rapid action of IL-33 in eliciting
scratching behavior in urushiol-challenged mice (Fig. 5B). In
contrast, IL-33 injection into naïve mice did not elicit significant
scratching during the first 30 min (Fig. 5D). These data indicate
that IL-33 is more potent in inducing scratching behaviors in
mice with fully established urushiol ACD.
We continued by determining whether the potentiating effect
of IL-33 on scratching behavior in urushiol-induced ACD mice is
mediated through the ST2 receptor. IL-33 together with ST2-
neutralizing antibody or isotype control IgG were coinjected s.c.
into the neck skin of urushiol-induced ACD mice. The ST2-
neutralizing antibody almost completely abolished the poten-
tiating effect of IL-33 on scratching at both the 0- and 4-h time
points (Fig. 5E). Thus, we have established a pivotal role of

 IL-33 in mediating the chronic scratching in urushiol-induced
ACD mouse.
Behavioral responses to itch and pain are difficult to distinguish.
We therefore used a recently introduced rodent model in which
pruritogenic (or algogenic) stimuli are applied to the cheek (24).
After the third urushiol challenge on the cheek, urushiol-chal-
lenged mice showed more cheek-directed scratching and wiping
behavior than acetone-treated mice (Fig. 5 F and G). Injection of
IL-33 into the cheek of urushiol-challenged mice significantly in-
creased scratching, but not wiping, compared with vehicle-injected
mice (Fig. 5 F and G). The histamine H1 receptor antagonist,
cetirizine, had no effect on IL-33–induced cheek-scratching be-
havior (Fig. 5F). These results demonstrate that IL-33 can evoke
itch-related behavior in the inflamed skin of urushiol-induced
ACD mice via a histamine-independent mechanism.
DRG-Expressed ST2 Is Essential for the Itch Response of Urushiol-
Induced ACD Mice. To examine the contribution of neuronal ST2
to the itch response of urushiol-induced ACD mouse, we intra-
thecally (i.t.) administered ST2-targeted siRNA to knock down its
neuronal expression. Scrambled control siRNA was used as a con-
trol (Fig. 6A). qPCR confirmed that repeated i.t. delivery of ST2
siRNA significantly reduced St2 gene expression in DRG neurons,
without altering Il1rl2 or Il31ra gene expression (Fig. 6B). Spinal
cord St2 gene expression was not significantly changed by siRNA
treatment (Fig. 6C). ST2 protein expression in DRG neurons was
also significantly reduced by siRNA treatment (Fig. 6 D and E).
Notably, i.t. ST2 siRNA significantly attenuated the itch response
and skin inflammation of urushiol-induced ACD mice, without
altering locomotion activity of the mice (Fig. 6 F–H). Therefore,
these results established a crucial role of ST2 expressed in DRG
neurons in mediating the itch response of urushiol-induced
ACD mice.

 Discussion
Environmental exposure to poison ivy is the most common cause
of ACD in the United States, representing a significant public
health burden. ACD is elicited by direct contact with the plant or
indirectly by contact with contaminated clothing, shoes, and
tools. Inhalation of smoke from burning plant material is espe-
cially hazardous and can trigger severe respiratory allergic re-
sponses (2, 5). Strong and persistent itch and skin inflammation
are the major manifestations of poison ivy ACD. In contrast to
other environmental allergic conditions, little is known about the
specific mechanisms underlying itch and skin inflammation in
poison ivy-induced ACD.
Studies modeling ACD almost exclusively used synthetic ex-
perimental allergens, such as oxazolone and DNFB, that are not
present in the environment. However, different allergens cause
widely divergent immune responses, making it difficult to predict
mechanisms and therapeutic strategies for ACD elicited by
common environmental allergens such as urushiol (25, 26). We
therefore optimized and characterized a mouse model of poison
ivy ACD and applied transcriptomic, biochemical, neurophysio-
logical, and behavioral methods to identify the inflammatory and
pruritic mechanisms engaged in murine poison ivy ACD. We
identified a critical role of IL-33/ST2 signaling in both itch and
skin inflammation in this model and revealed a previously un-
known interaction of IL-33 with primary sensory neurons that
may underlie the itch mechanism of urushiol-induced ACD.
The concentrations of urushiol used for sensitization (2.0%)
and challenge (0.5%) in the mouse model in the present study are
within the range of concentrations known to elicit contact der-
matitis in humans. A patch test study observed that challenge with
a 1.0% solution resulted in allergic skin responses (erythema to
bullae) in 75% of U.S. volunteers, representative of the degree of
sensitization estimated to be present in the U.S. population (19).
Leaves of the plants belonging to the Toxicodendron family, such
as poison ivy, oak, and sumac, contain up to 2.5% urushiol (wt/wt)
that is concentrated in resin droplets on the leaf surface (27). The
resin of the Japanese lacquer tree, also of the Toxicodendron family
and known to cause occupational allergies in lacquer workers, con-
tains between 55% and 75% urushiol (28). Thus, local skin expo-
sures are heterogenous, but well within the range of concentrations
used in our study.
Emerging data have demonstrated that certain cytokines and
chemokines can act as endogenous itch mediators (29). Some
cytokines are released from skin and immune cells and contribute
to the cross-talk between the immune and nervous systems. Ex-
amples include IL-31 and CXCL10, which were shown to signal
through their cognate receptors on primary sensory neurons to
induce itch. However, we did not observe up-regulation of IL-31
and CXCL10 transcription in the skin of urushiol-challenged mice,
indicating that these cytokines do not contribute to the observed
pathology, with IL-33 fulfilling this role instead (Tables S1 and
S2). Nevertheless, because we observed residual itch responses in
mice after IL-33–/ST2-neutralizing antibody treatment, other en-
dogenous pruritogens or mediators, in addition to IL-33, are likely
involved in the itch response of urushiol-induced ACD mice as
well and remain to be identified.
IL-33 is a member of the IL-1 cytokine family. In addition to
the well-documented role in immune and inflammatory diseases,
IL-33/ST2 signaling was also found to contribute to pain (30, 31).
Although ST2 expression has been detected in spinal cord neu-
rons and implicated in spinal pain mechanisms, expression and
function of ST2 in peripheral sensory neurons have not been
explored in detail.
Our study has provided several lines of evidence that suggest
functional expression and a physiological signaling role of ST2 in
peripheral sensory neurons. First, our qPCR data demonstrate
that ST2 transcript is expressed in both mouse and human
DRGs. This finding is supported by a recent study that also dem-
onstrated ST2 transcript expression (at a level comparable to the
functional IL-5R) in Nav1.8-expressing primary nodose ganglion
neurons (32). Second, our immunofluorescence-staining and ret-
rograde-labeling experiments revealed that ST2 is expressed in a
subset of small to medium-sized TRPV1-expressing DRG neurons,
including neurons that innervate the skin. Immunostaining also
identified the presence of ST2 in skin free nerve endings, where
IL-33 produced in the skin would have direct access. Thirdly, our
Ca2+ imaging experiments clearly demonstrated that IL-33 can
induce robust Ca2+ responses in cultured DRG neurons, and this
response is largely abolished by a monoclonal ST2-neutralizing
antibody. IL-33 activated Ca2+ influx into ∼7% of cultured DRG
neurons from naïve mice. Although our immunofluorescence
studies detected ST2 in a larger proportion of neurons in sec-
tioned DRGs, the essential binding partner IL-1RAcP was de-
tected in a smaller percentage of cells, suggesting that functional
IL-33 receptors, consisting of ST2 and IL-1RAcP, are limited to a
relatively small neuronal population. IL-33–induced Ca2+ re-
sponses in DRG neurons were almost completely abolished in
Ca2+-free extracellular solution or by ruthenium red, a TRP
channel blocker, and largely abolished by specific TRPA1 and
TRPV1 antagonists. It is well established that TRPA1 and TRPV1
are involved in itch transduction (33). Therefore, it is possible that
TRPA1 and TRPV1 act downstream of IL-33/ST2 signaling to
initiate itch signaling. Lastly, our targeted knockdown of ST2 ex-
pression in DRG neurons by i.t. siRNA injection significantly re-
duced the itch response of urushiol-induced ACD mice. This
result further demonstrates the importance of neuronal ST2 in
mediating the itch signal under the ACD condition.
Keratinocytes are known as a source of IL-33 in the skin, often
induced by proinflammatory factors such as TNF-α and IFN-γ
(20). We found that IL-33 expression is significantly increased in
the epidermis and is exclusively expressed in keratinocytes un-
der urushiol-induced ACD conditions. The interaction between
keratinocytes and primary sensory neurons plays an important role
in the development and maintenance of chronic itch conditions
(34). Therefore, we propose here that keratinocytes may directly
communicate with cutaneous sensory neurons via IL-33, which is
released upon tissue inflammation or injury, to promote itch.
The population of IL-33–responsive DRG neurons correlated
to a large extent with that of CQ- or histamine-responsive neu-
rons, indicating that IL-33 activates primary sensory neurons that
mediate the sensation of itch. In addition, treatment of urushiol-
induced ACD mice with IL-33– or ST2-neutralizing antibodies
significantly attenuated the scratching response. Cutaneous IL-33
injection rapidly increased scratching behavior in urushiol-chal-
lenged mice. IL-33 is known to cause mast cell degranulation and
release of histamine (35, 36). However, IL-33–induced itch in the
present study is unlikely to be mediated by histamine because the
antihistamine, cetirizine, at a dosage that effectively blocks hista-
mine-related itch (37), had no effect on the IL-33–induced itch
response. Therefore, these results suggest that IL-33/ST2 signaling
may likely mediate allergic itch response through direct activation
of itch-sensing primary sensory neurons.
Although our data strongly support a neuronal mechanism of
ST2 in mediating itch signaling in urushiol ACD, we cannot rule
out the possible participation of more indirect pathways in-
volving nonneuronal cells. It is known that ST2 is expressed in
Th2 cells, in a variety of innate immune cells as well as in skin
cells (23). IL-33 can interact with keratinocytes, mast cells, and
other immune cells through ST2 to produce proinflammatory
mediators and cytokines, including TSLP, histamine, serotonin,
and IL-13, that have known roles in the initiation of allergic
diseases and itch (35, 38–40). Our in vivo experiments using ST2-
neutralizing antibodies may have interfered with the actions of
these cells types in addition to the sensory neurons. These cells may
also contribute to the residual scratching behavior we observed

 in mice injected with ST2-neutralizing antibodies, and the path-
ways involved remain to be studied.
Our study showed that IL-33 did not elicit any obvious scratching
behavior in naïve mice, but did evoke significantly more itch-related
scratching after urushiol challenge. In line with this finding, we
observed that IL-33–induced Ca2+ responses are more pronounced
in DRG neurons from urushiol-treated mice than from naïve mice.
The above phenomenon is likely due to the sensitization of itch-
signaling pathways under chronic itch conditions. Sensitization of
itch-signaling pathways has been proposed as a critical mechanism
underlying chronic itch (41, 42). In ACD and atopic dermatitis,
nerve fiber densities are increased in the epidermis (43, 44). Ex-
tension of these nerve fibers into the epidermis may contribute to
spontaneous itch, aggravating itch responses and sensitization of
itch signaling pathways (42). Enhanced animal behavioral scratching
and DRG neuron responses to pruritogens have been documented
in a mouse chronic dry-skin model (45). Similarly, CXCL10, which
is a nonpruritogenic chemokine in naïve mice, was found to turn
into a potent pruritogen in the inflamed skin of a mouse model of
ACD (14). Along the same lines, it is likely that urushiol-induced
ACD sensitizes itch-signaling pathways, such that IL-33 becomes a
pruritogen to evoke itch responses under the ACD condition.
Our findings suggest that blocking IL-33/ST2 signaling may
represent a therapeutic approach to ameliorate itch and skin
inflammation in poison ivy ACD and, possibly, other chronic itch
conditions in which IL-33/ST2 signaling may participate. Cur-
rently, ACD patients are treated with antihistamines and corti-
costeroids. Antihistamines are largely ineffective to counteract
itch, an observation replicated in our mouse model in which
cetirizine failed to suppress the scratching behavior. Corticoste-
roids have known side effects and need to be administered early
after exposure to be effective. Therapies targeting IL-33/ST2
signaling may be especially useful in individuals known to de-
velop severe anaphylactic complications after allergen exposure
and in individuals known to develop life-threatening respiratory
allergic responses to urushiol, including forest firefighters for
whom poison ivy is an occupational hazard (4).
Materials and Methods
Animals. Experimental procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee of Duke University. Male C57BL/6 mice (6–8 wk old)
were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory. Mice were housed at facilities
accredited by the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Labora-
tory Animal Care in standard environmental conditions (12-h light–dark
cycle and 23 °C). Food and water were provided ad libitum.
Urushiol/Oxazolone-Induced Allergic Contact Dermatitis Model. C57BL/6 male
mice were sensitized by applying 2.0% (wt/vol) urushiol or oxazolone to the
shaved abdomen. After 5 d (day 0), mice were challenged with 0.5% urushiol
or oxazolone by painting on the shaved nape of the neck. On days 2 and 4,
mice were challenged with urushiol or oxazolone in the same way as day 0,
for a total of three to five challenges.
Scratching Behavior Analysis. Behavioral experiments were performed as
described (16). All behavioral tests were performed by an experimenter
blinded to experimental conditions.
DRG Neuron Culture and Ca2+ Imaging. C1-T1 bilateral mouse DRGs from ei-
ther acetone- or urushiol-treated mice were dissociated as described (46).
Ca2+ imaging using Fura-2 was performed 24 h after DRG dissection.
Mouse Transcriptome Microarray. RNA samples were processed by Affymetrix
GeneChip Mouse Transcriptome Assay 1.0. The Affymetrix Mouse Tran-
scriptome 1.0 CEL files were imported into Affymetrix Expression Console
Software and analyzed by using the Gene Level-SST RMA normalization
method. The datasets of the microarray analysis are illustrated in Tables S1
and S2.
Retrograde Labeling of Skin-Innervating DRG Neurons. The 0.5% Fast Blue was
injected (i.d., 3 μL per site) at seven sites on the shaved nape of the neck of
mice under anesthesia. At 4–5 d later, bilateral cervical DRG neurons (C1-T1)
were collected.
Immunofluorescent Staining. Immunofluorescent staining was performed and
analyzed as described (16).
siRNA Knockdown. Selective ST2 siRNA and scrambled ST2 control siRNA were
synthesized by Dharmacon. siRNA was dissolved in 5% glucose and mixed
with the in vivo transfection reagent in vivo-jetPEI (Polyplus) and incubated at
room temperature for 15 min according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
Intrathecal injection was performed by a lumbar puncture to deliver re-
agents to the cerebral spinal fluid under anesthesia. A total of 3 μg of siRNA
in 10-μL volume was injected i.t. once a day for two days to knockdown ST2
expression. Two days after the last siRNA injection, C1-T1 DRG neurons and
spinal cord tissue were collected and subjected to qPCR or immunostaining
to test the efficiency of ST2 knockdown.
Statistics. Statistical analysis were made between groups by using Student’s t
test (for comparison between two groups) or one- or two-way ANOVA (for
comparison among three or more groups) followed by Tukey post hoc test.
Comparison was considered significantly different if P was <0.05. Data in bar
graphs are expressed as means ± SE.
Details of methods and materials are described in SI Materials and Methods.
