pastic paresis is a complex condition associated with damage to the upper motor neurons, typically caused by cerebral palsy, 
multiple sclerosis, stroke or trauma. Despite substantial impact on patients’ independence and burden on caregivers, there is a lack 
of consensus on optimal management of this condition and the patient journey remains unclear. A group of physicians, experienced 
in spasticity management, recently convened with the objective of analysing the patient journey from a care pathway perspective in different 
geographical regions and under different conditions from acute phase to long-term/chronic disease status. The experts reviewed results 
from recent patient and healthcare practitioner surveys on the subject and assessed how current patient pathways could be improved, using 
their own experiences to highlight the issues related to management deficiencies in their individual countries. The group divided the patient 
journey into steps, considering the evidence from the point of view of healthcare practitioners, patients, caregivers and funders/payors. 
This paper is a response to the lack of consensus on the optimal management of spastic paresis, and acts as a call to action to develop a 
consistent care pathway that could be applied across a broad range of illnesses, using an interdisciplinary approach.

EUROPEAN NEUROLOGICAL REVIEW
Special Report  Spastic Paresis
Patients with spastic paresis often endure prolonged treatment regimens, 
where each journey is patient-specific and often difficult. Spasticity – 
defined as increased, involuntary, velocity-dependent muscle tone that 
causes resistance to movement – is a complex condition that often 
causes pain, contractures and impairment of basic self-care activities of 
daily living, such as eating, dressing and attending to personal hygiene. 
Although the terms ‘spasticity’ and ‘spastic paresis’ are often used 
interchangeably, the clinical features of spastic paresis are broader, 
including muscle over-activity, spasticity, dystonia and co-contractions.1,2 
We prefer the term ‘spastic paresis’ and have used it throughout this 
manuscript, but it should be noted that the vast majority of references 
still use the term ‘spasticity’. 
Spastic paresis is associated with damage to the upper motor neurons 
(UMNs) caused by varying underlying diseases, such as cerebral palsy 
(CP), multiple sclerosis (MS), stroke, or brain or spinal cord trauma, and 
is estimated to affect more than 12 million people worldwide.3,4 Despite 
the substantial impact of spastic paresis on patients’ independence and 
the burden it places on caregivers, there is a lack of published research 
on its epidemiology5 and, more importantly, on the patient journey: what 
does the journey look like, is it clear, and how easily can it be followed in 
different countries? It is also widely acknowledged that spastic paresis 
is under-diagnosed.6,7 Its prevalence varies between studies with, as yet, 
no widely accepted objective measure of spastic paresis. However, it is 
an accepted principle that if you cannot measure, you cannot manage. 
Spastic paresis and the concept of rehabilitation
Making a clinical diagnosis and implementing an optimal clinical 
management and rehabilitation programme depend on accurately 
assessing muscle tone, spasticity and functional impairment at multiple 
time points.8,9 There are several scales commonly used to assess spastic 
paresis. The Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS) is most often used to 
assess muscle tone;10 however, it cannot measure either the severity of 
spasticity or the loss of function that impacts the lives of patients and 
their families. Therefore, other broader scales or measures that capture 
changes important to the patients, such as goal setting and attainment, 
may better reflect an individual’s losses, expectations and achievements 
from treatment. The Tardieu scale is an example of this, which is more 
specific for assessing spasticity and which measures the affected limb’s 
resistance to movement at different speeds using the angle of arrest.11
Each patient has individual needs, and their path through the natural 
history of disease will vary.12 Typically, patients with spastic paresis expect 
their treatment to result in a reduction in muscle spasms and a return to 
normal daily routines.13 Managing adult patients, such as those with post-
stroke spastic paresis, requires an interdisciplinary approach and timely 
referral to the appropriate specialists according to the characteristics of 
 
the condition.14 The primary parameter of success is the attainment 
 
of independence following the re-learning of basic skills such as walking, 
eating and dressing, and ultimately reintegration into society.15 Therefore, 
successful rehabilitation depends on a comprehensive but dynamic 
programme, with appropriate goals being set and assessed at regular 
time points. This could cover acute inpatient care in a hospital, day-care 
at a rehabilitation unit of a hospital or outpatient clinic, or rehabilitation 
in the patient’s home.15
Targeted individual interventions are required; these should be tailored 
according to whether the spastic paresis is caused by stroke, trauma, MS 
or CP
, and to where the specific impairment is within the body and the 
central nervous system.8,9,12 Educating physicians and patients regarding 
appropriate goal setting as well as available therapeutic modalities 
including pharmacotherapy and non-pharmacotherapy treatment 
(e.g. physiotherapy or guided self-rehabilitation programmes) is a key 
requirement to improving patient outcomes. 
The patient journey 
The primary stakeholder throughout the rehabilitation journey is 
the patient, followed by his or her caregiver. The specific healthcare 
professionals (HCP) involved will vary depending on the underlying cause 
of the UMN lesion and on the patient setting. There are also various types 
of therapists (physical therapists, occupational therapists, etc.) involved. 
For example, if stroke is the underlying cause, the specialists involved will 
usually be neurologists at acute stroke units (within hospitals), and later 
on, physical medicine and rehabilitation (PM&R) specialists (physiatrists) 
at inpatient rehabilitation facilities. General practitioners are also likely to 
be involved, usually later in the patient pathway.
Other individuals involved in the patient rehabilitation journey include 
those in the financial and administrative sectors, such as insurers, 
healthcare service decision makers and policy makers. It is essential 
to consider that different healthcare systems offer different provisions. 
For example, within the US Medicaid system, although there is dramatic 
variation between states, there is generally no allowance for adult 
inpatient rehabilitation. It is important to note that much of the evidence 
for this paper comes from moderate-to-high income countries; situations 
may be very different in low-income countries.
Results of a survey on HCP perceptions of the patient journey and 
treatment with botulinum toxin type A (BoNT-A) were presented 
 
and discussed by the expert group, and subsequently a similar survey 
 
was completed by a group of patients with spastic paresis (see Table 1 
and the supplementary appendix for more details of the survey).16 The key

EUROPEAN NEUROLOGICAL REVIEW
Patient care pathways in spastic paresis and rehabilitation 
findings were that HCPs felt disappointment that spastic paresis was not 
classed as a separate condition and that there was no clear treatment 
pathway for patients with this diagnosis. Deficiencies included: referral 
delays, lack of guidelines, lack of access to BoNT-A treatment, and a high 
level of bureaucracy. Patients felt that spasticity greatly reduced their 
quality of life but that all parties lacked clear education and understanding 
of the treatable symptoms and potential treatment options, leaving 
patients with significant unmet needs. While patients trusted the key 
decision makers (usually neurologists) and experienced a smooth 
treatment process in the acute stages (e.g. stroke), they felt that an 
earlier awareness of the symptoms that could develop, and all treatment 
options, would have been welcome to improve the rehabilitation process. 
These qualitative surveys and the expert discussion highlighted the need 
to educate both HCPs and patient groups on the effects of spasticity, 
the benefits of early spasticity detection, and to raise awareness of all 
treatment options, including BoNT-A. Here we review the discussions of 
the experts, together with the results from these surveys, for each stage 
of the patient journey with regard to the different stakeholders (Figure 1). 
 
Although preparation for this manuscript did not include a formal 
systematic review of the literature, relevant reviews and published 
studies have been included to inform and support the authors’ opinions 
on this important subject based on the findings of the surveys. 
Step 1 – Diagnosis and decision to treat 
The patient
The initiation of treatment in spastic paresis is influenced by several 
factors related to the underlying cause of the spasticity (Figure 2). Spastic 
paresis seen in MS is a sign of disease progression, and 84% of patients 
with MS will experience at least one episode of spasticity.7 Patients with 
MS often simply accept spastic paresis as part of their condition not 
realising that it is treatable. By contrast, CP is treated from childhood, 
and continual assessment is needed, particularly at developmental 
milestones (e.g. transitioning from adolescence to adulthood), if 
treatment is stopped, or if follow-up is lacking or inconsistent. 
In stroke patients, there is a typical series of adjustment phases, from 
shock and dissimulation, to adjustment and acceptance.17 Not all 
patients who have a stroke or traumatic brain/spinal cord injury will 
develop spastic paresis initially. Therefore, many patients are discharged 
from acute units with no knowledge that they may develop spastic 
paresis within 12 months and that it can be treated.18 Furthermore, 
popular patient information websites, such as www.think-ahead.org.uk, 
 
neglect to include any information about the possible development of 
spastic paresis or potential treatment options. It has been estimated 
that approximately 20% of patients who experience a stroke develop 
spasticity after 3 months, and up to 40% develop it after a year.16,19 The 
predictive factors for developing spastic paresis after stroke include: 
the presence (and worsening) of paresis in the affected limbs, with more 
than two joints affected by increased muscle tone; poor motor control 
on Day 2; MAS ≥2 within a median of 6 weeks after stroke; left-sided 
weakness; and tobacco use.18,20,21 Community-based HCPs must be 
watchful for signs and symptoms of spastic paresis so that the patient 
can be referred for treatment.
In terms of treatment plans, there are a number of options, including 
combinations of oral and injected medications, use of orthoses, and 
regular physical therapy. Careful assessment of which symptoms of 
impaired motor function are limiting the individual patient is essential 
when selecting the appropriate treatment.22 However, barriers to the 
patient receiving appropriate treatment include an apparent lack of 
understanding of the terminology used by HCPs, and patients may also 
decide against treatment if they are given inadequate information.23 
Clearly, educating patients and caregivers is crucial and there needs 
to be a clear communication pathway.18 Patients also need to be made 
aware of factors that may aggravate the problem, which include, for 
example, bad positioning, tight shoes or heavy bed clothes.24
 
A pertinent example of a patient pathway for referral is the National 
Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) Stroke Pathway [NICE 
CG162], involving the patient, caregiver and the multidisciplinary team, 
which may include neurologists and consultants in PM&R.25 Despite 
the existence of guidelines such as these, generally, there was a 
consensus that patients are unable to recognise treatable symptoms 
or to understand the treatment options available to them. Patient and 
caregiver education is essential in enabling them to recognise the 
symptoms of spastic paresis and its comorbidities and precautions, as 
well as to encourage patients to actively participate in the treatment 
process (e.g. self-rehabilitation guided by their HCP).24,26
Healthcare professionals
A major challenge for interdisciplinary healthcare teams involved in 
treating spastic paresis is that the pathway from diagnosis to the decision 
to treat is highly variable, depending on the underlying condition, and 
many different professionals will be involved. It is not currently known 
how many physicians actually adhere to guidelines and treatment 
algorithms in diagnosing and treating spastic paresis. 
To facilitate decision making in terms of predicting the outcome of clinical 
and administrative choices, the value of simulation modelling has been 
demonstrated in several studies.12,27,28 However, there remains a lack of 
highly qualified staff specialising in spastic paresis. Clear communication 
pathways between HCPs and patients and their caregivers would help 
to facilitate this.

EUROPEAN NEUROLOGICAL REVIEW
Special Report  Spastic Paresis
Patient-centred goals are paramount 
Patients should not be seen from just a medical perspective. It is 
necessary to define why and how a particular patient is to be treated, 
and to have a patient-centred goal in mind.14,26 Spastic paresis should 
be treated if it interferes with functioning, positioning, or comfort, and 
it is advantageous that patients should be treated early unless there is 
a good argument against it. Ideally, treatment should be initiated before 
muscle or tendon shortening develops. Patient-centred goal setting 
is fundamental for successful rehabilitation, for patients’ willingness 
to continue treatment and to define the best intervention(s) for the 
patient.29 Without this, patients may be referred for a particular form of 
rehabilitation therapy out of habit, rather than because there is evidence 
to demonstrate that it will alleviate symptoms and restore function. Such 
failure to improve the patient’s wellbeing risks demoralising the patient 
and is a waste of resources. 
Guidelines for the treatment of spastic paresis emphasise the need for 
HCPs and patients to collaborate in setting goals for rehabilitation and 
in defining success criteria for achieving the goals. This includes using 
language that the patient can understand to describe their symptoms 
and their treatment.23 Current guidelines for the management of spastic 
paresis in different aetiologies are summarised in Table 2.
At all stages in the diagnosis and treatment of spastic paresis, the 
priority for HCPs should be to enable patient collaboration. However, 
there are challenges involved, and some physiotherapists (and other 
non-specialist health carers) have reported collaborative goal setting 
as ‘requiring significant effort, being complex and incredibly difficult’.30 
In goal setting, it has been established that at least one standardised 
outcome measurement should be used.8 
Treatment options
In terms of treatment options for spastic paresis, oral medications such as 
baclofen, tizanidine, dantrolene or benzodiazepines are well established 
and are the most common treatment of choice, with baclofen being the 
primary choice (except where stroke is the underlying cause), as they 
are regarded as easy to use and non-invasive.31,32 There is no evidence, 
however, that they have any effect on function, and it appears that there 
may be some instances of oral treatments being used even when they 
do not constitute the most appropriate therapy.31,33 These drugs may be 
unsuitable for use in patients with stroke because of the risk of sedation 
and lowering of the seizure threshold associated with their use.14 
The introduction of BoNT-A has had a significant impact on the treatment 
of focal spasticity in the upper limbs, and it is widely viewed as a well-
tolerated and efficacious treatment option (when used appropriately, 
based on the relevant country-specific guidance and applicable 
summary of product characteristics) in conjunction with physical therapy 
programmes.25,34–38 Preliminary studies suggest that it is best delivered early, 
when spastic paresis first sets in, in order to minimise the development 
of secondary complications, such as contractures.39 It is important to note 
that patients must also exercise and receive physical and occupational 
therapy, as long-term disuse can induce muscle atrophy. 
Despite evidence of the effectiveness of injectable medications (e.g. 
BoNT-A, phenol, alcohol)34,35 the authors believe that there exist certain 
preconceptions and beliefs around their use, which was also reflected 
in the survey responses. These notions are diverse, and in some cases 
conflicting. Some survey responders considered them as an option only 
when oral medications are unsuitable, or when stronger, second-line 
therapy is needed for more severe cases. Others viewed them as being 
completely ineffective or offering only very small benefits. Many viewed 
their role as being limited to patients with focal spasticity, particularly in 
the case of BoNT-A.37 There is a need, therefore, to review and in some 
cases challenge these perceptions. Indeed, it was agreed that when 
patients are not directed to the right specialist to guide their treatment 
journey, they often remain oblivious of these alternative injectable 
treatment options and may continue to take inappropriate medications 
for an extended period. However, there are challenges around addressing 
these barriers, such as the insufficient numbers of trained professionals 
in current practice who are capable of administering such injections. 
Injection techniques also vary between trained practitioners.40 In fact, a 
recent survey found that nearly half of patients have to wait more than a 
year before receiving their first BoNT-A injection.13
 
It has been shown that coaching patients to perform daily self-
administered, rapid alternating stretches can improve spastic paresis by 
gradually lengthening muscles and reducing their stiffness.41,42 Schemes 
in which patients and healthcare practitioners jointly set realistic goals 
for the improvement of symptoms have been shown to be more 
motivational than standard rehabilitation programmes.42 
In addition to oral and injectable medications and guided self-
rehabilitation, other treatment options include intrathecal baclofen, 
physiotherapy, occupational therapy, and surgical treatments (as a final 
option). These different treatment options are discussed in more detail in 
the guidelines in Table 2 and in other review papers.32,43–45
Financial and administrative barriers
A coherent and clear set of options for a patient treatment pathway, 
guided by overarching treatment guidelines, would need to incorporate 
country-specific financial and administrative aspects to optimise the 
patient treatment journey. A US study found that constraints on decision 
making caused by the health insurance model disrupted the process, 
resulting in delays in the patient’s diagnostic and treatment journey.46 
Furthermore, another study, which analysed data from the 2005 
Behavioural Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) survey on stroke 
survivors in 21 US states, found that only 30.7% received outpatient

EUROPEAN NEUROLOGICAL REVIEW
Patient care pathways in spastic paresis and rehabilitation 
Table 2: Overview of guidelines for managing spasticity
Guideline
Summary
Guidelines for the diagnosis and 
treatment of spasticity58 
• A flow chart to diagnose and treat the patient is mandatory to achieve the best results according to the individual needs of 
each patient
• Oral medications often give poor results or have undesired side-effects
• Intrathecal baclofen is a good option to treat diffuse spasticity 
• BoNT-A, as well as peripheral neurotomies, are very helpful in focal spasticity
Clinical management of spasticity59
• Contains an algorithm for patient care decisions from diagnosis
• It is essential that management targets function and is always patient-focused rather than aimed at reducing the degree of 
spasticity
• The management strategy should incorporate an understanding of spasticity in the context of the UMN syndrome to allow 
self-management strategies to be employed with an understanding of when further treatment strategies are needed to 
prevent secondary complications
• All patients requiring treatment should receive a physiotherapy and nursing treatment plan
• If this proves insufficient, BoNT-A should be added for focal spasticity and oral or intrathecal medications should be added 
for general spasticity
Approach to spasticity in general 
practice60
• Spasticity management is more effective in the multidisciplinary setting
• Early multidisciplinary approach and goal setting is crucial
• Education and clear communication between patients, caregivers and HCPs is essential
• Early intervention and optimal therapy prevents long-term complications
• Focal spasticity responds well to BoNT-A, whereas general spasticity requires oral or intrathecal medications
Spasticity in children and young 
people with non-progressive brain 
disorders61
• Children and young people with spasticity should have access to a network of care that uses agreed care pathways 
supported by effective communication and integrated team working
• The management programme should be developed and implemented in partnership with the patient and their parents or 
caregivers and should be individualised and goal focused
• The patient should be monitored for response to treatment, worsening of spasticity and development of secondary 
consequences of spasticity, and personalised goals should be changed if necessary
• All patients referred to the network team should be promptly assessed by a physiotherapist and, where necessary, an 
occupational therapist. An adapted physical therapy programme is an essential component of management
• Consider treatment with oral diazepam or baclofen for pain, muscle spasms, functional disability 
• Consider treatment with BoNT-A for focal spasticity
• Consider treatment with intrathecal baclofen for pain and muscles spasms and in the event of problems with posture, 
function and self-care
Treatment of spasticity following 
spinal cord injury in Norway62
• Spasticity following a spinal cord injury must be assessed regularly. The treatment strategy depends on the degree of 
functional failure caused by the spasticity and its location
• Indications for treatment are based on assessment and measurement of patients’ loss of function and on clinical 
examination
• All patients with spasticity should be urged to exercise. If this is not sufficiently effective, the patient should have 
physiotherapy with guidelines for exercises that counteract the spasticity
• The most widely used pharmacological treatment options are oral or intrathecal baclofen and repeated intramuscular 
injections with BoNT-A
Advances in the management of 
multiple sclerosis spasticity: multiple 
sclerosis spasticity guidelines63
• Contains details of Spanish and German guidelines and offers a putative European guideline
• The aims of spasticity treatment are to improve mobility and dexterity, achieve physiological movement patterns, reduce 
pain, facilitate nursing measures and avoid complications such as contractures
• Representative antispasticity medications include baclofen, tizanidine, gabapentin, dantrolene, tolperisone, benzodiazepines 
and nabiximols oromucosal spray. BoNT-A and intrathecal baclofen may also be required in selected cases
Practice guideline update summary: 
Botulinum neurotoxin for the 
treatment of blepharospasm, cervical 
dystonia, adult spasticity, and 
headache: Report of the Guideline 
Development Subcommittee of the 
American Academy of Neurology64
• Aims to provide an update on the 2008 American Academy of Neurology guidelines regarding BoNT in the treatment of 
blepharospasm, cervical dystonia, headache, and adult spasticity
• In this update, the different BoNT formulations are considered separately as there are differences in safety and efficacy 
between them
• In the treatment of adult upper limb spasticity, abobotulinumtoxinA, incobotulinumtoxinA, and onabotulinumtoxinA have 
been established as safe and effective 
• In the treatment of adult lower limb spasticity, abobotulinumtoxinA and onabotulinumtoxinA have been established as safe 
and effective 
• For abobotulinumtoxinA , four new trials observed significant reductions in upper limb tone 
• Regarding caregiver burden for those with upper limb spasticity, treatment with abobotulinumtoxinA led to a reduction of 
≥4-points on the carer burden scale for 67% of caregivers 
• For onabotulinumtoxinA, four studies revealed the efficacy of treatment in tone reduction for upper limb spasticity 
• For incobotulinumtoxinA, two new trials showed significant improvement in tone reduction

rehabilitation, possibly due to a lack of, or inadequate access to, 
rehabilitation clinics or centres and resources.47 In Germany and Russia, 
despite evidence of its efficacy and safety, there are several barriers to 
the implementation of BoNT-A therapy, including: a lack of awareness 
of guidelines or agreement among HCPs; the need for country-wide 
provision of services in every geographical area; the costs associated 
with BoNT-A injections and rehabilitation overall; and the required staff 
time both in skill development and patient interactions.48,49
 
There is a global lack of specialist care and rehabilitation units, and 
financial constraints persist in terms of insurance and government 
funding. In some countries, patients who are suitable for treatment are 
receiving mixed messages as, despite information stating that BoNT-A 
treatment for spastic paresis is covered by insurance plans, they do not 
actually receive the treatment because there are not enough specialist 
centres.8 This may have serious consequences, as it has been found 
that frustrated patients and caregivers who are not receiving enough 
information on accessing rehabilitation options seek out, and pay for, 
inappropriate services.8
Although reimbursement for BoNT-A is limited in many countries due to 
perceived cost barriers, it has been shown that it may actually be more 
cost-effective than oral regimens.26 The lack of information on the global 
impact of spastic paresis (as measured in terms of morbidity, mortality, 
quality of life and economic burden) is largely due to a lack of robust data 
addressing these topics.5 Further research is therefore needed to guide 
HCPs, patients, and policy makers on the benefits of fully understanding 
and managing spastic paresis.5 In addition, BoNT-A may simply not be 
available in the patient’s country or locality.
A summary of the barriers identified in the discussions to the first stage 
of the patient journey are shown in Table 3.
Step 2 – Treatment 
The patient 
Treatments for spastic paresis include exercise and stretching, which 
may be used in combination with medication. ‘Contracts’ between 
therapists (who pledge to deliver an effective rehabilitation programme) 
and patients (who commit to following the programme) are motivational 
and effective.42 The European Stroke Organization and The Stroke 
Foundation of Australia recommend that BoNT-A should be considered 
alongside rehabilitation therapy for post-stroke spasticity. The Australian 
guidelines note that intrathecal baclofen is effective but rarely used.50,51
Once the decision to proceed with BoNT-A treatment has been made, 
patients themselves may be hesitant in agreeing to start or continue 
with treatment. This may be for a variety of reasons, including innate 
aversion to injections, fear of treatment with a ‘neurotoxin’, or because 
they perceive it as a cosmetic procedure.
Healthcare professionals
From a HCP perspective, barriers to optimal BoNT-A treatment may 
include the influence of institutional or personal bias, a lack of knowledge 
or skill, or a failure to use best practice procedures (Table 4).52 As discussed 
previously, patient-centred goal setting should form a central part of 
BoNT-A treatment combined with other physical therapies. These could be 
augmented in several ways: developing individual best practice strategies 
for different goal categories (such as pain or function);28 broadly changing 
the attitude among HCPs towards neurotoxin therapy; and developing 
more comprehensive education programmes to train future injectors.9
The decision as to when patients should actually start treatment 
depends largely upon the underlying cause. For patients with brain and 
spinal cord injuries, or who have experienced a stroke, the initial focus 
of the interdisciplinary team must be to save the patient’s life. Once the 
 
patient’s condition has been stabilised, the team must plan for 
 
Table 3: Step 1 – Barriers to decision making from diagnosis 
to treatment decision
Practicalities and logistics
• Delayed access on referral (neurologists, physiotherapists)
• No clear pathway for those discharged in community (stroke and CP
, e.g. in 
Russia)
• Complex insurance procedures or associated costs (e.g. in USA)
• Level of bureaucracy required for approval of using certain products
• Lack of access to rehabilitation centres
Attitudes and opinions
• Symptoms may not be recognised by patients or HCP or there may be a lack 
of communication between the different members of the treatment team
• Spasticity treatment may not be considered relevant in patients with mild 
effects or in patients at the critically ill stage 
• Treatment of spasticity can be perceived as very time consuming and 
difficult to treat
• Patients decide against treatment
• Patient circumstances can influence treatment choice (e.g. in Russia patients 
have to pay for their treatment)
Knowledge gaps
• Lack of highly qualified or experienced staff and specialists in spasticity or 
injection
• HCP recognition of spasticity vs other underlying symptoms (especially MS)
• Spasticity not classified as a separate condition
• Patients may not mention or recognise that they have spasticity or know 
that it can be treated
• Patients may prioritise treatment of other symptoms, not realising the 
potential impact of spasticity
• Caregivers are not trained to recognise symptoms of spasticity
CP = cerebral palsy; HCP = healthcare professional; MS = multiple sclerosis;
Table 4: Step 2 - Summary of barriers from the decision to 
use BoNT-A to the frst injection
Practicalities and logistics
• Time delay in waiting for injection
• Waiting list (UK and Germany); lack of experts in injection technique (Russia); 
insurance authorisation (USA and Brazil)
• Waiting for stock to be delivered to clinic
• Too costly for patients (Brazil, Russia)
• Reimbursement difficulties or prescription caps
• Lack of suitable treatment space
Attitudes and opinions
• NOT for generalised/diffuse muscle spasticity
• Baclofen/automatic choice (especially for MS/CP)
• NOT seen as a first line therapy (more aggressive, costly); typically for 
moderate–severe spasticity
• Patient acceptance of first line options – no exploration of alternatives
• Lack of confidence in use of BoNT-A or injections
• Patients resistant, fearful of BoNT-A
• Image as ‘cosmetic procedure’
Knowledge gaps
• Need for more experts in BoNT-A and appropriate treatment centres
• Perceived lack of procedures/ protocols

EUROPEAN NEUROLOGICAL REVIEW
Patient care pathways in spastic paresis and rehabilitation 
the patient’s rehabilitation. In the UK and USA, some facilities discharge 
patients from acute care with ‘rehabilitation prescriptions’ that enable 
them to rapidly access the most appropriate rehabilitation therapy 
without having to organise this for themselves.53 This is, by no means, a 
universal practice in the countries surveyed in the workshops – many 
patients have long waiting times for treatment, receive inappropriate 
treatment or end up with no treatment at all because it is difficult to 
access, is in short supply, or because it is not reimbursed.
Financial and administrative considerations
In this step, financial and administrative considerations are introduced 
along with those from patients and HCPs. Financial and administrative 
barriers to the initiation of BoNT-A treatment in practice is different from 
the barriers associated with other treatments (e.g. oral medications) as 
BoNT-A is perceived as a more expensive treatment option, including the 
time delay in waiting for the injection (which may be due to waiting lists, 
limited numbers of trained injectors, or delayed approval of treatment), 
as well as cost issues similar to those seen in step 1 (Table 4),8 BoNT-A 
has, however, been shown to be a cost-effective treatment option.54
A summary of the key discussions regarding step 2 of the patient journey 
(the initiation of treatment) are shown in Table 4.
Step 3 – Long-term management
Patient factors
Rehabilitation after an UMN lesion is a lifelong process. However, many 
patients contend with insufficient outpatient rehabilitation and monitoring 
in the long term (Table 5).8 Although physical therapy (stretching, 
positioning and splints) remains the mainstay of the management of 
spastic paresis,36 the goals of physical therapy are often not well defined, 
leading to patients feeling unmotivated and disheartened, which may 
mean they decide to discontinue their rehabilitation. Variations in 
treatment frequency or reliance on multiple therapists can also affect the 
patient’s confidence in the therapy and their perception of its usefulness. 
Without adopting guidelines to establish the expected level of input 
from the patient and the anticipated outcome, it is difficult to define or 
recognise a successful treatment programme.
Healthcare professionals
The treatment process for injectable medications is often seen as 
overly complex. Ideally, HCPs should conduct frequent patient-driven 
assessments with the appropriate therapists in order to assess the effect 
of BoNT-A and establish a patient-driven self-management pathway 
with commitment from all parties.8 The usefulness of registries, such 
as the The Paul Coverdell National Acute Stroke Registry (PCNASR)55 
and the North American Research Committee on Multiple Sclerosis 
(http://www.narcoms.org/) should also be mentioned for their value as 
tools to collect data, and to monitor and track long-term care, with the 
aim of improving patient care. 
Financial and administrative considerations
Financial and administrative considerations become even more 
important in the long term management of the patient’s disease. It is a 
truism that the chances of successful rehabilitation in the long term are 
largely governed by the availability of resources.54 However, therapy can 
become intermittent or discontinued as a result of factors such as lack 
of insurance or reimbursement, as discussed in the previous sections.
In terms of the financial and administrative aspects of long-term 
management, the cost of continued treatment can be seen as prohibitive, 
and there can also be constraints in terms of staff time to monitor and 
assess patients on an ongoing basis.54 If patients and HCPs are not able 
to demonstrate continued improvement on medical records with BoNT-A 
treatment insurance companies may stop paying for the treatment. 
Alternatively, if there is a change of circumstances at home, patients may 
have trouble getting to the clinic for their therapy.
These expert discussions, as well as the HCP and patient surveys, 
highlighted the great variation in the patient journey and challenges 
faced in different countries. However, they also demonstrated that the 
barriers are usually the same, just of different magnitudes and with 
different impacts on the patient pathway (Figure 3). This suggests that 
global recommendations on how to improve the patient journey for 
individuals with spastic paresis are needed.
Discussion and conclusion 
Spastic paresis occurs as a result of UMN damage, which may be due 
to stroke, brain trauma, spinal cord injury or CP
, as well as underlying 
conditions such as MS. It should be treated as early as possible in order 
to prevent muscle or tendon shortening and to thereby improve eventual 
limb function or position. However, many patients are not treated 
appropriately.56 The majority of patients are lost to follow-up or their 
journey is unclear. This is partly because spastic paresis remains under-
diagnosed and its burden on patients under-recognised by clinicians. 
Therefore, education is key to addressing this issue. Currently, there is 
also no clear treatment pathway for many patients with spastic paresis. 
There is, therefore, a need for universal guidelines on the optimum 
treatment pathway to include all treatment modalities, including BoNT-A, 
which is recommended by several guidelines, but not all.
As rehabilitation is a life-long process, patients have to be trained 
and guided in order to continue to perform rehabilitation on their 
own (self-rehabilitation). During treatment there is a need to tailor 
treatment to the individual patient, as UMN syndrome presents in a 
very heterogeneous manner. Objective assessments with validated 
functional outcome tools are essential to measure treatment success 
and to motivate patients to continue. Patient-centred SMART goal setting 
(specific, measurable, achievable, realistic and timed), is also important 
in terms of treatment programmes in order to establish realistic 
treatment expectations, minimise dropouts, and allow therapy to be 
 
tailored to patients’ needs.57
In addition to patient education, there is an overall need for education 
at all levels across the interdisciplinary team, from clinicians to physical 
therapists. Trained BoNT-A experts are also needed, following training

• Cost of continued treatment can be prohibitive (particularly in the USA, 
Russia, Brazil)
• Lack of organisation of outpatient services (Russia)
• Lack of patient access for repeat treatments
Attitudes and opinions
• Perception of non-response after 1st injection
• Temporary solution, lengthy commitment
• Protocol for monitoring BoNT-A treatment is seen as complicated
• Patients lack motivation

in the proper targeting techniques for injection; the consensus at the 
meeting was that stimulation-controlled or ultrasound-guided injections 
should always be used to improve the accuracy of injections, improve 
functional outcomes, reduce side-effects, minimise wastage of 
neurotoxin, but most of all, to avoid causing patient harm.
Although the challenges to implementing optimal treatment programmes 
vary by country, patients with spastic paresis face devastating 
consequences or additional limitations if they do not receive timely and 
appropriate treatment for their condition. Patients may rely on their 
caregiver and/or HCP to determine their best treatment options, and to 
navigate the variable provider and funding hurdles to obtain the best 
treatment and follow-up. 
In order to provide optimal care for patients with spastic paresis, a 
united and coordinated effort among all parties involved should be in

EUROPEAN NEUROLOGICAL REVIEW
Patient care pathways in spastic paresis and rehabilitation 
place, including patients, caregivers, medical multidisciplinary team, 
national legislators, as well as healthcare payors and insurers. There is 
no mechanism currently in place in any of the countries represented by 
the authors that incorporates all of these critical entities. 
Financing this comprehensive and wide-reaching effort over a prolonged 
period continues to be a major barrier to achieving optimum treatment 
for patients with spastic paresis; it has been clearly demonstrated that 
these patients are under-treated. Although there is a need to ensure 
that the additional use of injectable medications is clinically indicated, 
collaboration with industry in a coordinated effort may make it possible 
to achieve a significant difference for patients who are not currently 
receiving appropriate treatment. In order to achieve the optimal results 
for this particularly vulnerable patient population, new and creative, yet 
controlled, approaches will need to be pursued.
Recommendations
Expert recommendations to address the perceived barriers to the ideal 
patient journey are summarised in Table 6. It is hoped that by means 
of further expert panel meetings, and via reports of key conclusions, 
constructive changes can be expected in the field of spastic paresis 
management and treatment supported by clearer guidelines. q
