Abstract
Human metapneumovirus is an emerging cause of lower respiratory disease in infants, young children, and immuno-
compromised adults. We have previously demonstrated that human metapneumovirus infection is mediated by inter-
action of human metapneumovirus attachment (G) and/or fusion (F) proteins with cellular glycosaminoglycans. We
report here the activity of an investigational sialidase fusion protein, DAS181, on human metapneumovirus infection
of Hep-2 cells. These results suggest that human metapneumovirus infection may involve sialic acids, providing a new
therapeutic strategy for human metapneumovirus for which there is currently no available treatment.
Methods: Hep-2 cells were preincubated with DAS181 or control DAS185 (a mutated sialidase) prior to inoculation
with human metapneumovirus strains. Infectivity was assessed by a cell-based ELISA quantitating human metapneumo-
virus matrix protein. The effect of DAS181 on binding of recombinant G attachment protein was also determined.
Results: DAS181 blocked infection of human metapneumovirus strains A2, B1, and B2 at low concentrations. No effect
of DAS185 was observed. Binding of MPV G protein to Hep-2 cells was also markedly inhibited by preincubation of cells
with DAS181.
Conclusions: These results suggest that human metapneumovirus may utilize sialic acids as an entry cofactor. DAS181
may thus represent a new therapeutic agent useful for the treatment of human metapneumovirus.

Background
Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) is a common cause
of respiratory illness in infants and young children
worldwide and is also increasingly described in adults
and immunocompromised patients.1,2 We have previ-
ously demonstrated that hMPV infection is mediated
by interaction of hMPV attachment (G) and/or fusion
(F) proteins with cellular glycosaminoglycans (GAGS),
as infection is inhibited by soluble GAGS such as hep-
arin and chondroitin sulfates, or by enzymatic removal
of cell surface GAGS with GAG lyases.3
Cell surface glycoproteins, glycolipids, and proteo-
glycans are utilized by a wide variety of viruses. Most
carbohydrate structures used by viruses as receptors are
strongly negatively charged, including sulfated GAGs
or glycans containing sialic acid.4 Influenza viruses are
the prototypic GAG binding viruses and utilize cell sur-
face sialic acids as a receptor to mediate infection.5
Previous studies6 demonstrate that an investigational
sialidase fusion protein, DAS181, inhibits influenza
virus infection by cleaving terminal sialic acids from
glycoproteins. DAS181 is comprised of a sialidase cata-
lytic domain active on both human and avian influenza
viruses and a heparin-binding domain from human
amphiregulin, which localizes and retains the fusion
protein to the respiratory epithelium. As a fundamen-
tally novel host-directed approach against respiratory
viruses, DAS181 has potential broad-spectrum activity,
reduced risk for drug resistance, improved efficacy and

In
this
study,
we
determined
whether
DAS181
has any effect on hMPV replication in vitro and also
examined the effect of this sialidase fusion protein on
binding of recombinant hMPV G attachment glycopro-
tein to cells.
Methods
Sialidase fusion protein
Sialidase fusion protein (DAS181) was kindly provided
by Ansun BioPharma (San Diego, CA). DAS181
consists of a heparin-binding domain derived from
amphiregulin
(amino
acid
residues
125–145
in
GenBank entry AAH09799) fused via its N terminus
to the catalytic domain of Actinomyces viscosus sialid-
ase (AvCD, amino acid residues 274–667 in GenBank
entry X62276).6 DAS185 is a mutated sialidase express-
ing construct that has the identical amphiregulin tag
but exhibits 400-fold reduced sialidase activity com-
pared to DAS181. The drugs were supplied as a dry
powder and solubilized in sterile PBS to a stock
concentration of 50 mg/ml.
Cells and viruses
The human epithelial tumor cell line, HEp-2, and
rhesus monkey kidney cells (LLC-MK2) (American
Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were grown
in medium 199 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) supple-
mented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Stocks of
hMPV were prepared by inoculation of LLC-MK2
cells with hMPV and incubation for 14–21 days at
37�C
in
5%
CO2.
hMPV
stocks
(International
Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses, ICTV, nomencla-
ture) used for infectivity assays were as follows: V50569
and V51200 (A2 strains), V47041 and V32748 (B1
strains), and V52283 (B2 strain). All strains of hMPV
were isolated from clinical samples by the diagnostic
Virology
Laboratory,
Flinders
Medical
Centre,
Bedford Park, South Australia. These samples were
positive by RT-PCR only for hMPV and were not coin-
fected with influenza A; influenza B; RSV; adenovirus
or parainfluenza 1, 2, or 3. All virus stocks were stored
at �70�C until use. hMPV infectivity titer was deter-
mined using an immunofluorescence assay. Briefly, cells
were incubated with dilutions of the virus and counted
after staining with a monoclonal Ab (MAb) to hMPV
matrix protein (Chemicon, Temecula, CA) and FITC-
labeled secondary antibody (Chemicon). The virus titer
was
calculated
assuming
each
fluorescent
focus
represented one infectious unit of virus and was
reported as fluorescent focus forming units (FFU) per
milliliter.
hMPV infectivity ELISA
A cell-based ELISA assay was used to quantitate
hMPV infection. HEp-2 cell monolayers in 96 well
plates (Linbro, ICN Biomedicals, Aurora, OH) were
inoculated with hMPV at a multiplicity of infection of
1 FFU per cell and incubated for 2 h at 37�C, 5% CO2.
Control wells were ‘‘mock’’ inoculated with no virus.
Cells were
washed with medium 199 to remove
unbound virus. Medium 199 containing 1 mg/ml trypsin
was then added and cells were cultured for 48 h.
Medium was removed and cells were fixed with 1%
paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min at room tempera-
ture. Cells were washed twice with PBS, and permeabi-
lized with 0.02% Triton X-100/PBS for 30 min at 4�C
followed by two washes with PBS. Nonspecific sites
were blocked with 5% skim milk/PBS for 1 h. The
wells were then incubated with hMPV matrix protein
MAb diluted 1:320 (v/v) in 0.5%Tween20-PBS fol-
lowed
by
1:10,000
(v/v)
horseradish
peroxidase
(HRP)-conjugated sheep anti-mouse IgG (Chemicon).
Each incubation was for 60 min at 37�C and the wells
were washed four times with PBS after each step. O-
phenylenediamine substrate (Sigma, St Louis, MO) was
added and after 30 min, 1 N H2SO4 was added and the
absorbance at 490 nm was determined. Wells were
inoculated in triplicate and each experiment was per-
formed at least two times. There was a linear relation-
ship between virus input and optical density over a
greater than 100-fold range of virus inoculums.
Infectivity inhibition assays
The effect of DAS181 on hMPV infectivity was deter-
mined by a modification of the hMPV infectivity
ELISA. HEp-2 cells were pretreated with various con-
centrations of DAS181 diluted in EBD-BSA buffer
(10 mM sodium acetate pH6.0, 0.1 M NaCl, 10 mM
CaCl2, 0.5 mM MgCl2, 0.5% w/v BSA) for 2 h at
37�C. After 2 h incubation cells were washed twice
with 199 medium before inoculation with hMPV and
assessment of infectivity as above. Results are expressed
relative to virus infectivity of untreated HEp-2 cells.
For titration experiments, Hep2 cells in 96 well tissue
culture plates were treated with different concentration
of DAS181 for 2 h at 37�C. The DAS181 containing
media
was
removed
and
the
plate
was
washed
once
with
199
medium,
inoculated
with
hMPV
1.5 � 105 IFU/ml, and incubated plate in 5% CO2 incu-
bator at 37�C for 48 h. hMPV infection of Hep2 cells
was investigated using ELISA assay.

 G-protein-binding ELISA
Recombinant G protein was expressed in Pichia pastoris
and purified by nickel affinity chromatography as previ-
ously described.3 The binding of G protein to cells after
incubation with DAS181 was evaluated by ELISA.
Briefly, triplicate HEp-2 monolayers in 96 well plates
were treated with 5 or 0.5 mg/ml of DAS181 in EDB-
BSA buffer for 2 h at 37�C, the solutions from each
well were removed and the cells were washed twice
with PBS. Both the sialidase treated and untreated
cells were incubated with 100 mg/ml of biotinylated G
protein at 37�C. After 1 h incubation, unbound protein
was removed by being washed with 50mM phosphate
buffer, pH 7.4 (PB). Cells were then incubated with
1:1000 (v/v) HRP-conjugated streptavidin (Sigma) in
1% skim milk in PB at 37�C for 1 h. OPD substrate
was added and OD490nm was determined. The OD of
wells without G protein was subtracted as background.
Results are expressed as percentage binding relative to G
protein binding of untreated cells.
Results
Antiviral activity of DAS181 in vitro
The effect of DAS181 on hMPV infectivity was exam-
ined using a cell infectivity ELISA. To control for sia-
lidase-specific activity, the mutated sialidase expressing
molecule DAS185 was used at identical concentrations.
HEp-2 cells were treated with 10 mg/ml of DAS181 or
DAS185 for 2 h at 37�C before inoculation with hMPV
strains A2, B1, or B2. Viral infection was assessed 48 h
postinoculation. As shown in Figure 1(a), for all strains
of hMPV tested, infection was greatly inhibited by
pretreatment with DAS181 (Figure 1(a)) whereas the
sialidase defective DAS185 showed little to no activity
under similar conditions. It should be noted that
DAS181 had no effect on HEp-2 cells growth or viabil-
ity at a concentration of 50 mg/ml, indicating that the
decreased infection was not due to cell cytotoxicity
(data not shown).
We extended this finding by treating HEp-2 cells
with fivefold serial dilutions of DAS181 prior to infec-
tion of cells with B1 (V32748) virus. Figure 1(b) shows
that DAS181 treatment decreases hMPV infectivity in a
dose-dependent manner, with concentrations as low as
0.5 ng/ml exhibiting more that 50% inhibition of
infection.
Effect of DAS181 on hMPV-G protein binding to cells
hMPV-G protein is thought to play an important role
in viral attachment to host cells. We next examined if
exposure to DAS181 reduced G protein binding to
HEp-2
cells.
HEp-2
cells
were
pretreated
with
DAS181 for 2 h prior to incubation of cells with
100 mg/ml biotinylated hMPV-G protein and binding
was detected with streptavidin–HRP. Pretreatment of
HEp-2 cells with DAS181 markedly inhibited viral G
protein binding to cells, with concentrations of either 5
or 0.5 mg/ml inhibiting binding by approximately 75%
(Figure 2).
Discussion
DAS181 is a recombinant fusion protein composed of a
sialidase catalytic domain linked to a cationic sequence
tag of 21 amino acids in length derived from the
C-terminus of human amphiregulin (heparin-binding

 EGF). The pharmacological effect of DAS181 is the
removal of sialic acid residues (SARs) from the cell sur-
face that function as receptors for multiple respiratory
viruses dependent on SAR expression. DAS181 has
demonstrated inhibitory activity against over 70 influ-
enza and 15 parainfluenza laboratory strains and clinical
isolates, including influenza A (seasonal H1N1, 2009
pandemic H1N1, H2N2, H3N2, H9N2, H7N7, and
H7N9 subtypes), multiple influenza B strains, multiple
highly virulent influenza A H5N1 avian strains, and all
subtypes of human parainfluenza (PIV-1, -2, -3, and -
4).6–8 Clinical trials have also shown that DAS181 can
decrease viral load in influenza-infected patients.9
hMPV along with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)
comprise
the
pneumovirinae
subfamily
of
the
Paramyxoviridae family. Infection is initiated by two
viral surface glycoproteins, one for attachment (G)
and the other for fusion (F).10 The cellular target of
the
G
protein
is
glycosaminoglycans11
while
the
fusion protein appears to interact directly with the
host cell membrane to facilitate viral entry. The results
shown here support the hypothesis that DAS181 inter-
rupts hMPV infectivity in vitro at clinically relevant
concentrations. The exact nature of this effect remains
to be determined. The observation that infectivity was
blocked with DAS181 by not with the sialidase deficient
DAS185 suggests that sialic acid-containing GAGs are
required for infection. The titration of DAS181 in the
infectivity assay demonstrates that extremely low con-
centrations are capable of inhibiting infection, with an
estimated IC50 of 16 pM/ml. These results would sup-
port an enzyme-driven mechanism of action and sug-
gest that a sialic acid-expressing molecule may be
required as a coreceptor for productive hMPV infection
of Hep-2 cells. In support of this, a recent report has
shown
that
another
GAG-binding
virus
of
the
Polyomavirus family does require an as yet unidentified
sialylated
coreceptor
for
productive
infection.12
Subsequent work by Neu et al.13 has demonstrated
the presence of a sialic acid-binding site on VP1 that
is distinct from the GAG site. These authors suggest
that a two-step process of attachment via GAG and
entry via a sialic acid-expressing coreceptor may
extend to other virus families that utilize GAG as a
primary attachment site. Attachment of the related
RSV to Hep-2 cells has been reported to be insensitive
to the effects of tunicamycin and neuraminidase.14
However, Neu et al. have also suggested that simple
treatment of neuraminidase may not sufficiently reveal
this requirement for sialic acid expression, since virions
may remain attached to target cells in culture until
sialic expression regenerates. The results presented
here open the possibility that hMPV may exploit a simi-
lar two-step strategy for viral entry.
Conclusions
In summary we have shown that the DAS181 (but not
the sialidase deficient DAS185) blocks hMPV infection
and binding of hMPV G protein in vitro. These findings
identify a previously unknown sensitivity to sialidase
treatment and suggest that DAS181 may be therapeut-
ically active for the treatment of hMPV. As there are no
current treatments for hMPV, testing in existing cotton
rats or hamster models15 and subsequent human clin-
ical evaluation of DAS181 for the treatment of hMPV
should be a priority.
