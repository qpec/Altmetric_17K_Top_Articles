Objective:
To present recommendations for the diagnosis,
management, outcomes, and return to play of athletes with
superior labral anterior-posterior (SLAP) injuries.
Background:
In overhead athletes, SLAP tears are com-
mon as either acute or chronic injuries. The clinical guidelines
presented here were developed based on a systematic review of
the current evidence and the consensus of the writing panel.
Clinicians can use these guidelines to inform decision making
regarding the diagnosis, acute and long-term conservative and
surgical treatment, and expected outcomes of and return-to-play
guidelines for athletes with SLAP injuries.
Recommendations:
Physical examination tests may aid
diagnosis; 6 tests are recommended for confirming and 1 test is
recommended for ruling out a SLAP lesion. Combinations of
tests may be helpful to diagnose SLAP lesions. Clinical trials
directly comparing outcomes between surgical and nonopera-
tive management are absent; however, in cohort trials, the
reports of function and return-to-sport outcomes are similar for
each management approach. Nonoperative management that
includes rehabilitation, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs,
and corticosteroid injections is recommended as the first line
of treatment. Rehabilitation should address deficits in shoulder
internal rotation, total arc of motion, and horizontal-adduction
motion, as well as periscapular and glenohumeral muscle
strength, endurance, and neuromuscular control. Most research-
ers have examined the outcomes of surgical management and
found high levels of satisfaction and return of shoulder function,
but the ability to return to sport varied widely, with 20% to 94% of
patients returning to their sport after surgical or nonoperative
management. On average, 55% of athletes returned to full
participation in prior sports, but overhead athletes had a lower
average return of 45%. Additional work is needed to define the
criteria for diagnosing and guiding clinical decision making to
optimize outcomes and return to play.

A
superior labral anterior-posterior (SLAP) lesion is
an injury in proximity to the origin of the long
head of the biceps tendon. The glenoid rim is often
described as the face of a clock, with the superior rim at
12:00 and the inferior rim at 6:00. Typically, SLAP lesions
extend from the 10:00 to the 2:00 position. Via attachment
to the labrum, the long head of the biceps tendon forms the
biceps-labral complex. Although newer classification
schemes for SLAP lesions have been introduced,1 Snyder
et al2 proposed the most widely used system. Under this
Journal of Athletic Training
209
 system, type I describes degenerative fraying of the
superior labrum without detachment from the glenoid rim,
whereas types II to IV describe tears of the labrum with or
without involvement of the long head of the biceps tendon.
A SLAP lesion can be acute or chronic, and debate exists
over the exact mechanism of injury. In overhead athletes,
the mechanisms of a SLAP lesion have been associated
with repetitive overhead sport activities.3�5 Tensile forces
on the labrum via the biceps during the deceleration phase
of the overhead motion,3 torsional forces on the biceps
during the late cocking phase,4,5 and the high level of
repetitive eccentric forces of the biceps imparted to the
labrum may result in labral lesions.3
Based on the history and physical examination, the
differential diagnosis is limited because few clinical tests
can diagnose SLAP lesions with a high degree of accuracy.6
Type I lesions are not considered by most to be a source of
symptoms,7 whereas types II to IV may require treatment
for resolution of symptoms. Although SLAP lesions are
commonly found during imaging and surgery, the degree to
which the presence of these lesions is related to shoulder
pain and what treatment options will yield optimal
outcomes are unclear. Nonoperative and operative treat-
ments are used to return an injured athlete to sport activity.
Many patients achieve satisfactory outcomes and are able to
return to sport without surgery, so the first line of
recommended management is a 3- to 6-month program of
nonoperative treatment.8,9 Studies10,11 suggested a high
level of shoulder function and satisfaction after treatment,
but the ability to return to sport varied widely from 20% to
94%. The outcomes and ability to return to sport after
treatment for a SLAP lesion, with or without surgical
repair, are less than optimal.10�12
The purpose of this position statement is to present
recommendations for the diagnosis, management, and
outcomes of and return-to-play guidelines for athletes with
SLAP lesions based on the systematic analysis of peer-
reviewed publications and graded according to the Strength
of Recommendation (SOR) Taxonomy evidence-based
scale.13 The alphabet letter indicates the consistency and
evidence-based strength of the recommendation (A has the
strongest evidence base). For the practicing clinician, any
grade A recommendation warrants attention and should be
inherent to clinical practice. Grade B recommendations are
based on inconsistent or limited controlled research
outcomes. Grade C recommendations should be considered
as expert guidance despite limited research support. Less
research supports recommendations with grades B and C;
these should be discussed by the sports medicine staff.
RECOMMENDATIONS
Diagnosis
1. Mechanisms of injury that may be responsible for a
SLAP lesion can include repetitive overhead activities,
especially those requiring shoulder abduction and end-
range external rotation (ER), that impart tensile,
eccentric, or torsional forces on the biceps-labral
complex.1�3,14�17 SOR: B
2. A pain pattern described as posterior-superior or deep
within the anterior-superior glenohumeral joint may
reflect a SLAP lesion.18,19 SOR: C
3. Throwing athletes who present with posterior shoulder
tightness (loss of .158 horizontal adduction or a
glenohumeral internal-rotation deficit [GIRD] of .138
to 158 without a concurrent increase in ER of .158 as
compared with the nonthrowing shoulder) should be
considered to have an increased risk of shoulder injury,
including a SLAP lesion.4,20�23 SOR: B
4. Shoulder pain should not be considered a sign of a type
I SLAP lesion.7,24,25 SOR: B
5. A stand-alone finding of a history of popping, clicking,
or catching is not diagnostic of (ruling in or out) a
SLAP lesion.7,16,26 SOR: A
6. Bicipital groove or biceps tendon tenderness is not
diagnostic of a SLAP lesion.27 SOR: B
7. The active compression, or O’Brien, test is not
diagnostic of a SLAP lesion.6 SOR: A
8. Based on a meta-analysis of pooled diagnostic
accuracy values,6 individual physical examination tests
recommended with caution to confirm the diagnosis of
type II to type IV SLAP lesions are the anterior slide,
Yergason, and compression rotation.6 However, based
on the meta-analysis, no test is recommended for ruling
out a SLAP lesion. SOR: A
9. Based on evidence from multiple studies, individual
physical examination tests recommended with caution
to confirm the diagnosis of a SLAP lesion are the pain
provocation, anterior apprehension, and biceps load
II.24,27�33 The only test recommended for ruling out a
SLAP lesion is pain provocation.24,32 SOR: B
10. Combinations of tests may be helpful to diagnose a
SLAP lesion. Recommended with caution to confirm a
SLAP lesion are the anterior-slide test with a history of
popping, clicking, and catching7; the compression-
rotation, apprehension, and Yergason tests27; and the
compression-rotation, apprehension, and biceps load II
tests.27 Caution is warranted because each combination
has been investigated in only a single study. No test
combination can be recommended for ruling out a
SLAP lesion. SOR: C
11. If a patient does not respond to conservative care,
imaging is advised to aid in the differential diagnosis.34
A positive magnetic resonance imaging finding of a
SLAP lesion should be interpreted with caution if the
patient’s primary complaint and clinical findings do
not correlate with this injury.18 SOR: B
12. Partial- and full-thickness rotator cuff tears, acromio-
clavicular joint injuries, humeral head fractures, and
Bankhart lesions have been associated with SLAP
lesions and should be considered in the differential
diagnosis.1,2,17,35 SOR: B
Management
13. Patients with SLAP lesions should undergo 3 to 6
months of nonoperative management with the goals of
decreasing pain, improving shoulder function, and
returning to previous activity levels.8,9,36 SOR: B
14. Nonoperative management may include prescribed
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and corticoste-
roid injections to decrease pain and inflammation in the
disabled throwing shoulder.37�40 SOR: C
15. Supervised rehabilitation should address deficits in
shoulder internal rotation (IR), total arc of motion, and
210
Volume 53 � Number 3 � March 2018
 horizontal-adduction range of motion (ROM), as well
as periscapular and glenohumeral muscle strength,
endurance, and neuromuscular control.8,9 SOR: C
16. Before being considered for surgical intervention, a
patient with a SLAP lesion should fail to improve after
3 to 6 months of nonoperative management. Failure to
improve is characterized by the inability to regain pain-
free ROM and near-normal rotator cuff strength and to
return to the prior or desired level of activity.8,9 SOR: B
17. Surgical considerations for labral repair or debride-
ment are as follows:
a. Repair of a type II SLAP lesion at the biceps anchor
can be considered in those with episodes of biceps
anchor instability, shoulder instability, or persistent
pain with overhead activity.41,42 SOR: B
b. Debridement of the labrum is an option for type I
and select type III (bucket-handle) lesions.41 Biceps
tenodesis or tenotomy may be considered if the
biceps is hypertrophied, frayed, or synovitic. For
those with an unstable biceps anchor, repair of the
SLAP tear with a biceps tenodesis or tenotomy is a
possibility.43,44 Biceps tenodesis or tenotomy is not
typically advocated in baseball players or athletes
under 18 years of age. SOR: C
c. Other surgical considerations include release of the
posterior glenohumeral capsule ligament (if thick-
ened and contractured) in addition to a SLAP
repair45 and debridement of a ganglion or paralabral
cyst, with or without a concurrent SLAP repair.46
SOR: C
d. Deficits in ER ROM are the most consistent
impairments associated with poor outcomes after
surgery. Therefore, during repair of a SLAP lesion in
an overhead-throwing athlete, anchor placement
should preserve the required ER ROM in the
abducted and externally rotated position.36,47 SOR: B
Outcomes and Return to Play
18. Patients undergoing surgical or nonsurgical manage-
ment of SLAP lesions should be educated to expect a
patient-rated outcome (PRO) of 85% of normal
function at an average of 2 to 3 years.4,8,36,43,45,48�60
SOR: C
19. Patients should be informed to expect 80% satisfaction
within 2 to 3 years of surgery.4,43,50,53,56�59,61�63
However, the level of satisfaction was lower in
overhead athletes, with 67% reporting an excellent
rating.4,59,62 SOR: C
20. Patients should understand the need to regain 90% of
ROM in order to return to full activities.64 However, at
2-year follow-up, limited evidence suggested that
ROM deficits up to 158 may persist.53,57,58,60 SOR: C
21. Patients should be educated to regain at least 70% of
strength as compared with the uninvolved side before
starting a sport-specific or interval return-to-sport
program.64 SOR: C
22. Patients should be informed that the criterion for return
to sport activities is primarily time based, with
guidelines suggesting return to sport-specific training
at around 4 months postsurgery and progression to full
activities over the next 2 to 3 months.55,56,59�61,64 SOR:
C
23. Patients should understand that after nonoperative
management of a SLAP lesion, the rate of return to
sport varies from 40% to 95%, but these data are based
on only 2 studies.8,9 SOR: C
24. Patients should comprehend that, independent of
treatment intervention, 75% (range, 20%–94%) of
patients, on average, with a SLAP tear are able to
resume some level of sport activity.* Unfortunately, a
consistent definition of return to sport is lacking across
studies.67 SOR: C
25. Patient education after surgical intervention should
include the fact that the rate of return to sport for
overhead athletes is lower than for nonoverhead
athletes or nonathletes.12 Among all athletes, 55%
returned to the same or higher level of sport activity,
whereas 31% returned at a lower level of participation
or with limitations.10,11 Among overhead athletes, 45%
returned to the same or a higher level of sport
participation, whereas 34% returned at a lower level
or with continued limitations, and 24% were not able
to return.† SOR: C
26. Consistency in reporting PROs, the time and level of
return to play, and the type of treatment used is
recommended to adequately and accurately determine
successful management of patients with SLAP le-
sions.67

DIAGNOSIS
History, Observation, and Palpation
Evaluation should begin with a history that includes the
mechanism of injury and the degree of trauma sustained
during the injury. A history of trauma alone is not
diagnostic of a SLAP lesion.16 An acute mechanism may
be a fall on an outstretched hand, which has been reported
in 8% to 48%1,2,17 of patients with a SLAP lesion. A fall on
an outstretched hand creates a shear force at the biceps-
labral complex and glenoid with the shoulder in abduction
and slight flexion.2 This mechanism could also result in
other shoulder injuries, such as a rotator cuff tear or anterior
instability.2,18
A chronic SLAP lesion more commonly affects athletes
in repetitive overhead sports such as baseball, softball,
volleyball, and tennis.3 Hypothesized mechanisms of injury
include tension, torsion, and eccentric loads to the biceps
during sport activities that injure the biceps-labral complex.
Andrews et al3 hypothesized that tensile forces produced
during the deceleration phase of the throwing motion cause
the attachment site of the biceps at the labrum to pull the
anterosuperior portion of the labrum off the glenoid. The
increased biceps activity and subsequent tensile forces were
due to an eccentric contraction of the biceps as the elbow
extended in the deceleration phase. Conversely, cadaveric
studies that simulated the throwing motion showed that late
cocking was the only phase that produced greater strain on
the posterior labrum3 and failure of the superior labrum in
90% of cadavers, as compared with 20% during the
deceleration phase.14 Burkhart and Morgan5 proposed that
when the shoulder is abducted and externally rotated,
similar to the late cocked-arm position during the throwing
motion, torsional force is placed on the biceps at the labral
junction that causes the biceps to pull away from the
labrum: the ‘‘peel-back mechanism.’’ Unfortunately, this
concept has not been investigated experimentally.
Patients with SLAP lesions often complain of vague
shoulder pain during overhead motions and may have a
sensation of popping, clicking, or catching.1,3,16 However, a
history of popping, clicking, or catching as a stand-alone
finding is not diagnostic of a SLAP lesion.7,16,26 Moreover,
reports of night pain, pain during overhead activities, and a
sense of instability have not been associated with isolated
SLAP lesions.25 The patient should be queried regarding
the location, quality, and duration of the pain or
symptoms.18 Pain may be generalized to the shoulder, or
more likely, be described as a deep shoulder pain located
between the acromioclavicular and coracoid processes of
the scapula19 or at the posterior or anterior glenohumeral
joint.18 Pain levels and their effects on activities can vary
greatly. Maffet et al1 noted that among 84 patients
diagnosed with a SLAP lesion, 6% reported complete
disability, 1% had slight pain, 42% had moderate pain, 10%
had marked pain, and 10% had pain only after unusual
activities. A SLAP lesion may result in the ‘‘dead arm
syndrome.’’68 The specific phase of throwing or sport
activity that causes pain; the recent activity level, including
any changes in volume or intensity of activity (eg,
throwing, ball spikes); and decreases in velocity, control,
and muscular endurance should be investigated.69,70 Any
history of injury and prior treatments should be considered
along with patient-specific goals to develop an individual-
ized treatment plan.
Observation does not generally aid in the diagnosis of a
SLAP lesion, but the shoulder should still be inspected for
deformity, swelling, and atrophy to assist in the differential
diagnosis. Inspection and physical examination should
include the glenohumeral, sternoclavicular, and acromio-
clavicular joints. Similar to observation, palpation should
include the entire shoulder girdle and the surrounding bony
and soft tissue structures. Diagnostically, bicipital groove
and biceps tenderness has limited ability to confirm a SLAP
lesion.27�29
Glenohumeral elevation, horizontal abduction, and IR
and ER ROM should be assessed, as loss of motion can
suggest shoulder or elbow injury. No evidence has
indicated that altered glenohumeral ROM was specifically
related to a SLAP lesion. Overhead athletes, especially
throwing athletes, may present with excessive glenohumer-
al ER ROM and a concomitant loss in IR ROM.71 The loss
of IR, known as glenohumeral IR deficit (GIRD), may be
due to increased humeral retroversion (bony) or posterior
shoulder
tightness
or
both.72
Based
on
current
evidence,4,20�23 GIRD is defined as an asymmetric IR
deficit .138–158 without a concurrent increase in ER .158
(compared with the nonthrowing shoulder) at the start of a
season and has been related to the prevalence of shoulder or
upper extremity pain over a season in high school softball
and baseball players. Although GIRD and shoulder injuries
have been linked in baseball and softball players, a cause-
and-effect relationship has not been proven. Burkhart and
Morgan5 postulated that the peel-back mechanism is a
direct result of posterior shoulder tightness caused by soft
tissue adaptations. The increased tightness results in a
posterior-superior shift of the humeral head’s contact on the
glenoid, allowing for a greater degree of glenohumeral ER
ROM20 but also a theoretical increase in shear force at the
biceps-labral complex.4,5
Scapular motion abnormalities have been postulated to
relate to the development of SLAP lesions. The scapula lags
behind the humerus with respect to motion during arm
acceleration toward the intended target, which may lead to an
increase in both tensile forces to the anterior shoulder and
compressive forces to the posterior shoulder.69 Evidence to
support the diagnostic ability of or the cause-and-effect
relationship between scapular motion deficits and the
development of SLAP lesions is lacking.73 In overhead
athletes, researchers found that the preseason presence of
observable scapular dyskinesis (ie, dysrhythmia or winging)
during repetitive arm elevation predicted shoulder injuries
212
Volume 53 � Number 3 � March 2018
 during the season in handball players74 but not in baseball
players.75,76 Given the lack of clear evidence for an
association between observable scapular dyskinesis and
shoulder pain, other impairments detected during the physical
examination should provide guidance for conservative
management.77 The scapular examination and other associ-
ated impairments are discussed in the ‘‘Management’’ section.
Special Tests for Labral and SLAP Lesions
Clinical tests used to examine the integrity of the labrum
and biceps-labral complex attempt to reproduce pain or
symptoms. However, most diagnostic studies have been
conducted on heterogeneous populations rather than on
overhead athletes. Therefore, the clinical utility of these
tests may not be specific to overhead athletes. Pain or
clicking, popping, or catching can presumably be repro-
duced by compressing the labrum with the humeral head or
imposing a shear force by moving the humeral head on the
labrum or a tensile force at the biceps-labral complex.18
Unfortunately, few special tests used to diagnose SLAP
lesions have displayed consistent diagnostic accuracy
across studies. Our recommendations were based on
diagnostic accuracy statistics of sensitivity, specificity,
positive likelihood ratio (þLR), and negative likelihood
ratio (�LR). The criteria for recommendations were as
follows: (1) a test or finding with a specificity of �80% or a
þLR �2.0 would confirm (rule in) a SLAP lesion and (2) a
test or finding with a sensitivity of �80% or a �LR �0.50
would rule out the diagnosis.78 When available, meta-
analyses were preferred as the basis for recommendations.
The active compression, or O’Brien, test is commonly
used and has been the most frequently studied for
diagnostic accuracy. However, reports of sensitivity
(47%–100%)
and
specificity
(10%�99%)
varied
widely.16,24,26,28,30,79�82 In the original study81 of the active
compression test, a positive finding of pain alone did not
indicate a SLAP lesion. Rather, the patient should
specifically describe pain or clicking deep in the joint as
opposed to in the anterior-superior shoulder, which reflects
acromioclavicular joint injury. In 2012, Hegedus et al6
pooled the diagnostic accuracy of 6 studies (n ¼ 782
patients) assessing the active compression test and reported
67% sensitivity and 37% specificity, a þLR of 1.06, and a
�LR of 0.89 when the original study, which was an outlier,
was removed. The active compression test is therefore not
recommended to confirm or rule out a SLAP lesion.
Hegedus et al6 also reported pooled diagnostic values for 7
other tests used to diagnose SLAP lesions. The pooled values
indicated that the 3 clinical tests useful for confirming a
SLAP tear were the anterior slide, Yergason, and compres-
sion rotation (summarized in Table 1). No tests could be
recommended for ruling out SLAP lesions based on the
pooled diagnostic values from the meta-analysis results using
a priori established thresholds. The pooled diagnostic values
of the Speed, crank, and relocation tests and palpation of the
long head of the biceps indicated that these results were
inadequate to diagnose (rule in or out) SLAP lesions.
Subsequent investigators have assessed several other
physical examination tests. Investigated in multiple studies
(Table 1) and recommended with caution to confirm a
SLAP lesion are the anterior apprehension,27�29 biceps load
II,27,30,31 and pain-provocation24,32 tests. To rule out a SLAP
lesion, only the pain-provocation test24,32 is recommended.
These tests are recommended with caution due to
inconsistent findings or limited diagnostic ability demon-
strated in multiple studies. Three tests examined in single
studies that showed promise with high ability (þLR . 6.0)
to rule in SLAP lesions were the dynamic labral shear (þLR
¼ 36.0), passive-distraction (þLR ¼ 8.8), and passive-
compression (þLR ¼ 5.9) tests.6
Because many special tests for SLAP lesions have widely
varying diagnostic accuracy values, several authors found
that combining specific tests increased the likelihood of
correctly diagnosing a SLAP lesion. Table 2 details
investigated test combinations that are recommended for
confirming a SLAP lesion, but these recommendations are
offered with caution as they have been examined in only a
single study. Oh et al27 reported that combining 2 relatively
sensitive tests (compression rotation and anterior appre-
hension) with 1 relatively specific test (Yergason or biceps
load II) demonstrated diagnostic values adequate for
confirming a type II SLAP lesion but not for ruling out
this lesion. McFarland et al26 observed that compared with
each test alone, combining the active-compression, anteri-
or-slide, and compression-rotation tests did not increase the
diagnostic accuracy for type II to IV SLAP lesions.
Michener et al7 assessed the ability to diagnose type II to
IV SLAP lesions and found that a positive anterior-slide
test combined with a history of popping or catching had
diagnostic utility for confirming a SLAP lesion but was of
limited value for ruling out a SLAP lesion. No tests or test
combinations were diagnostic for a type I SLAP lesion. Of
note, a history of popping, clicking, or catching was also
investigated15 in patients with a variety of labral lesions,
including SLAP lesions. When the history was combined
with a positive crank or anterior-slide test, high specificities
and positive LRs indicated an ability to confirm a labral
lesion; however, the ability to rule out labral lesions was
limited. Table 2 summarizes the test combinations
recommended for confirming a SLAP lesion but these
suggestions should be interpreted with caution as the tests
have been assessed in only a single study.
Because SLAP lesions are often accompanied by an
associated injury, a definitive diagnosis can be difficult. In
patients with SLAP lesions, 72% to 77% had associated
injuries.7,16,17,26 Concurrent conditions may include partial-
(26%–32%) and full-thickness (4%–15%) rotator cuff
lesions, Bankhart lesions (22%), acromioclavicular joint
injuries (11%), and humeral head chondromalacia or
indentation fractures (15%).1,2,17,35 Given the high incidence
of associated conditions, the clinical evaluation should
include a thorough examination for possible intra-articular
damage. Impingement special tests are frequently positive in
those with SLAP lesions: 47% to 68% of patients have a
positive Neer or Hawkins-Kennedy test,1,17 which may
represent a false-positive finding of a SLAP lesion. To
confirm the presence of a SLAP lesion, tests recommended
for ruling in a SLAP lesion (Table 1) should be used.
The clinical examination is fundamentally limited in the
ability to differentially diagnose a SLAP lesion.6 Imaging is
an important tool for diagnosing SLAP lesions and is
warranted for the differential diagnosis. The American
College of Radiology33 recommended radiographs as the
initial imaging study, followed by magnetic resonance
arthrography if a SLAP tear is suspected. Furthermore, if a

MANAGEMENT
This section reviews the nonoperative and operative
management of overhead athletes with SLAP lesions,
including recommendations and clinical considerations for
successful management. The SLAP lesions addressed in
these recommendations are due to overhead throwing. The
outcomes of interest were those directly related to returning
the overhead-throwing athlete to preinjury status. Outcomes
were assessed via PRO scales for disability or satisfaction
with shoulder function. Because many patients achieve
satisfactory outcomes and are able to return to sport without
surgery, a 3- to 6-month program of nonoperative treatment
is recommended as the first line of management.8,9
Nonoperative Management
A course of nonoperative management is often the initial
approach when symptoms related to a SLAP tear develop.
A staged, multimodal approach to nonoperative treatment is
advised, aimed at resolving modifiable impairments
including posterior shoulder flexibility, shoulder IR deficit
and horizontal-adduction loss, strength, endurance, and
neuromuscular control of the glenohumeral and periscap-
ular musculature to restore shoulder function.77 This
process most often includes nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
medication or intra-articular corticosteroid injections (or
both) in conjunction with physical therapy, followed by
progressive therapeutic interventions.59,83�86 Of note, no
researchers have evaluated the effects of ROM and muscle-
performance exercises in a homogeneous population of
patients with isolated SLAP tears. Thus, the reported
improvement in symptoms and function and the ability to
return to full activity were attributed to a multimodal
rehabilitation approach.8,9 However, many patients, partic-
ularly overhead athletes with type II to IV SLAP lesions
and instability, fail to improve with nonoperative manage-
ment, leaving surgical intervention as the remaining
option.8,36,41,57,60
Studies of nonoperative care for patients with SLAP tears
are limited. This may be due to the evolution of the
diagnosis and surgical repair over the last 15 years:
management of shoulder pain typically included a nonop-
erative trial, but this likely occurred before a SLAP lesion
was confirmed. Long-term follow-up (3.1 6 1.5 years)
showed that almost half (49%) of patients with SLAP
lesions did not require surgery, suggesting some level of
success with nonoperative management.8 The nonoperative
management included nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
drugs, intra-articular corticosteroid injections, and an
average of 18 (range, 4–40) supervised physical therapy
sessions. Although nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
are helpful for reducing general shoulder pain and
improving function in the short term, no researchers have
specifically examined their effects in patients with SLAP
lesions. Rehabilitation should focus on core and periscap-
ular stabilization, rotator cuff strengthening and neuromus-
cular control, and posterior shoulder stretching for 3 to 6
months.8,9 Overhead athletes undergoing nonoperative care
showed significant improvements of greater than 50% in
function, pain, and quality of life for 18 of 19 patients.
Specifically, 67% of overhead athletes (10 of 15) in the
nonoperative group returned to their preinjury activity
level. Because the evidence for nonoperative management
is SOR C, the recommendation is to consider pain and
associated impairments in overhead athletes as the basis for
the rehabilitation program.
Range-of-Motion Deficits. Measured at 908 of
abduction, deficits in shoulder ROM including total arc of
motion, IR, and horizontal adduction have been shown to
increase the injury risk in overhead athletes and have been
reported in overhead athletes, including those diagnosed
with SLAP lesions.4,21�23,87�89 Authors of prospective
injury risk studies have indicated that deficits in the total
arc of motion (ER þ IR) of as little as 58, passive IR �258,
or horizontal adduction �158 increased the injury risk in
skeletally mature baseball players. Specifically for pitchers,
a deficit �158 in horizontal adduction but a deficit �138
only in IR predicted upper extremity injuries, which
included SLAP lesions.21,23 These motion deficits have
been reported in overhead athletes diagnosed with SLAP
lesions.87,88,90,91 Thus, based on these studies, a
rehabilitation
program focused
on glenohumeral
mobilizations and stretching to improve posterior
shoulder flexibility and rotator cuff and scapular
stabilization strengthening and a home exercise program
consisting of sleeper and cross-body adduction stretches
were recommended. All athletes experienced resolution of
symptoms and returned to full activity after 21 6 5 visits
over 7 6 2 weeks. Concurrently, improvements in ROM of
IR and ER and horizontal adduction of 78 to 108 occurred.91
It is important to note that these overhead athletes presented
with posterior or superior shoulder pain but were not
pitchers, nor were they definitely diagnosed with SLAP
lesions. In collegiate and professional players, stretching of
the posterior structures of the shoulder has been effective in
increasing shoulder ROM (IR or horizontal adduction or
both) within a single session92 and over multiple

 seasons.93,94 Therefore, the evidence suggests that restoring
the symmetry in IR, horizontal adduction, and the total arc
of motion should be 1 goal of nonoperative management of
overhead athletes with shoulder pain, among them those
with SLAP lesions.
Muscle Performance. Over the course of a professional
season, deficits in posterior shoulder strength are associated
with the development of arm injuries that include SLAP
lesions.95 Additionally, the preseason ratio of ER : IR
strength was more highly correlated with shoulder injury
than baseline ER strength alone, suggesting that the relative
imbalance was just as important as absolute ER strength.95
Ratio deficits in posterior rotator cuff endurance and
strength compared with the anterior rotator cuff have
been theorized as risk factors for the development of arm
injuries in pitchers.95�97 In professional pitchers, decreased
ER muscle performance relative to IR strength was
associated with subsequent injury during the season,
indicating they were more likely to experience arm
injuries, including SLAP tears.95 Additionally, preseason
deficits in shoulder-elevation strength have also been linked
to injury in high school pitchers.98 These findings support
the concept that similar to ROM deficits, such strength and
endurance deficits are thought to be the result of repetitive
overhead use.99�101 Therefore, theoretically, the restoration
and balance of ER : IR strength ratios are critical in
prevention and rehabilitation protocols.64 Preseason
strengthening programs have been shown to increase ER
and IR strength as well as to normalize strength
ratios102�106; however, no evidence indicates that these
strengthening programs prevent shoulder injuries in
overhead athletes.
Scapular Motion and the Kinetic Chain. Alterations in
scapular movement have been reported in overhead athletes
with shoulder pain74,107�109 and found to predict the
development of shoulder pain in handball players.74 It is
not clear if these alterations are a causal or a compensatory
impairment. Assessment for scapular dyskinesis of
dysrhythmia and winging can be performed visually109,110
but should be combined with symptom-alteration tests to
determine if deficits of scapular motion and control
contribute to shoulder pain. Specifically, the scapular
retraction or reposition test111,112 and the scapular assist
test113 can be conducted; if symptoms are altered, then
muscle-performance and -length tests should be carried out
to determine their contribution to shoulder symptoms.
Motor control and performance along with stretching
focused on related impairments to the scapula may be
warranted. Assessments of lower extremity strength and
core stability during lower extremity balance tasks such as
the single-legged squat, single-legged balance, and Y-
balance test suggested that alterations in the kinetic chain
were associated with shoulder and elbow injuries in the
throwing athlete.114�116 These assessments may help to
direct treatment at deficits in core stability and lower
extremity strength and flexibility to improve shoulder
performance.
In summary, based on the available evidence, compo-
nents of a structured rehabilitation program should consist
of normalization of shoulder ROM (equal total arc of
motion, IR, and horizontal adduction), scapular and rotator
cuff strengthening and motor control performance, and core
and lower extremity kinetic chain exercises. In our opinion,
resolving these impairments provides the best opportunity
to restore pain-free shoulder function and allow full
overhead athletic activities without surgical repair of the
SLAP lesion. Failure of nonoperative treatment after 3 to 6
months suggests that further workup and imaging34 are
indicated before planning surgery.
Operative Management
Operative management should begin with arthroscopic
confirmation and classification of the SLAP tear describing
biceps anchor disruption and superior labral avul-
sion.42,117,118 Surgical treatment is then dictated based on
classification and can include debridement, posterior
capsulotomy, anterior capsule plication, superior labral
repair, biceps tenotomy, biceps tenodesis, or a combination
of these procedures. Each surgical option is briefly
described as it has been reported in the literature in
relationship to SLAP tears in overhead athletes.
Debridement. Arthroscopic evaluation is completed
through anterior and posterior portals. The unstable
portion of the labrum is sharply excised, and adjacent
synovitis may be resected.41
Capsulotomy. A preoperative examination under
anesthesia is performed, and the reduction in humeral IR
is compared with the contralateral extremity. After the
SLAP lesion is confirmed and classified, the posterior space
is reduced posteriorly when viewed from an anterior
articular portal. Articular scissors or an ‘‘arthroscopic
punch’’ is used to divide the soft tissue, and a
capsulotomy is performed from the posterosuperior to
inferior aspect along the posterior-inferior band of the
glenohumeral ligament (from approximately 8:00 to 6:00).
This is followed by gentle ROM for additional stretch and
to confirm the improved IR.41,71,90
Capsular Plication. In select patients determined to have
symptomatic increased anterior glenohumeral translation,
an
anteroinferior
capsular
plication
may
be
accomplished.119,120 Small plications with both absorbable
and permanent sutures are performed. These may include
the inferior glenohumeral ligament and potentially the
anterior capsular middle and superior glenohumeral
ligaments. Alternatively, thermal techniques may be used
to reduce the length of select tissues.121
Repair of the SLAP Lesion. Two techniques were
included in the literature review: tacks and suture
anchors.11,41,57,59,86,122 In both techniques, the glenoid
neck is debrided, and the labrum and biceps anchor are
reduced and then fixated. Knots or knotless fixation is used
to grasp and repair the tissue.
Biceps Tenotomy and Tenodesis. The biceps can be
separated from the damaged labrum by sharp division.
Options are releasing the biceps alone or proceeding to a
form of tenodesis to the proximal humerus.44,122 The soft
tissue or bone can be affixed above or below the bicipital
groove. This procedure is often combined with debridement
of adjacent damaged soft tissue.
The available literature primarily earned an SOR grade of
C for describing the authors’ techniques for patients with a
type II lesion. Most of the articles had subsections on
atraumatic or overuse versus traumatic injuries, other
athletes versus overhead-throwing athletes, and a variety
of outcome measures. Many researchers measured and
216
Volume 53 � Number 3 � March 2018
 reported the chances of successful anatomical repair but did
not document return-to-sport results. In early studies,
investigators90,107 described good or excellent results but
not a return to preinjury status. Authors of more recent
studies indicated lower levels of return to full activity after
a SLAP repair in overhead athletes; outcomes and return-
to-sport rates are presented in detail in the ‘‘Outcomes and
Return to Play’’ section. Patients who underwent debride-
ment had early improvement but often regressed to their
preoperative status by 2 years after surgery. Although no
single study has directly compared debridement versus
nonoperative care,11 the latter was not associated with a
higher percentage of patients demonstrating a 50%
improvement in PRO. Debridement alone is commonly
performed, but long-term success appears limited.41,123,124
Capsulotomy was an isolated surgical option in patients
with SLAP lesions. This was often combined with another
procedure addressing type II SLAP lesions. Posterior
capsular stiffness was addressed with preoperative thera-
peutic stretching, though capsulotomy can be considered if
improvement is limited.41,71,90
Anterior capsular plication was performed in patients
with symptomatic excessive anterior translation. Early
successful reports of thermal capsulorrhaphy combined
with debridement offered reason for some enthusiasm.
Concerns about loss of ER limited this approach in the
overhead thrower, yet in select patients with internal
impingement, this treatment has been successful.119,125 An
important factor is determining the significance of
increased humeral translation. In an experimental model,
type II SLAP lesions increased anterior and posterior
translation. Therefore, the significance of humeral transla-
tion in producing symptoms should be considered in
selecting the preferred treatment. An additional question
is whether the increased translation caused or was the result
of the SLAP lesion.
Repairs of type II SLAP lesions had variable outcomes,
as detailed in the next section. Anatomically, most studies
suggested a stabilizing effect, but unfortunately, stiffness
and loss of desired ER in the abducted position is a
potential complication associated with an inability to return
to throwing.36,44,126 Earlier studies of absorbable tacks
showed good return-to-play rates, yet reactions to the
implants shifted the consensus to suture anchor repairs.
Complications including stiffness, knot impingement, and
biceps subluxation have been reported, indicating that
appropriate patient selection and technique may be critical
in the overhead athlete. The distinctive biomechanics and
the significant demands of rotation make the overhead
athlete unique.
Early procedures using absorbable tacks had success
(87% good to excellent outcomes) in allowing patients to
return to sport; however, there were concerns about
complications related to the degradation of the implant.
Suture anchor techniques had good or excellent results
(70%–94%), although return to the previous level of sport
was limited.36,41,57,60,123 The return to overhead throwing or
the preinjury level was 53% to 57%, including adolescent
and young adult throwers. Athletes younger than age 20
were at greatest risk for additional surgery due to continued
symptoms after surgical repair.36
Biceps tenodesis or tenotomy has been reported to be an
effective method for patients with biceps groove pain or
pathologic changes within the biceps (ie, type IV SLAP
lesion, subluxation, tendon thickening).43,127 In younger
overhead athletes, these procedures have been considered
an alternative to a SLAP repair; yet to date, outcomes have
been reported only in case studies. The biceps complex is
thought to play a supportive role in protecting the
stabilizing effect of the anterior-inferior capsule. However,
biceps tenotomy or tenodesis has not been shown to
improve or compromise this structure. Biceps tenodesis is
an option in patients with an associated rotator cuff tear43
and failed SLAP lesion repair,44 suggesting its role in the
presence of the combined injury. The biceps tenotomy or
tenodesis has been helpful in more complex cases,
including revision surgery, but it is unclear if biceps
tenodesis in the younger athlete is a viable primary option.
Biceps detachment may be helpful in reducing shoulder
pain but does not address the potential effect of reducing
glenohumeral translation anteriorly and inferiorly. In
patients with symptomatic biceps anchor changes who
require labral repair for stabilization, tenodesis may have a
role.
The significance of increased anterior translation in the
throwing shoulder and whether this needs to be reduced in
symptomatic athletes remain questions. Patients consider-
ing surgical repair should be counseled on its potential
limits and the ability to return to their prior level of function
after operative intervention. Multiple techniques have been
recommended, which would suggest that complex condi-
tions often coexist with the SLAP lesion in the symptomatic
athletic shoulder.
OUTCOMES AND RETURN TO PLAY
After an injury, the goal is to return the athlete to his or
her prior level of function given the individual demands of
the sport. The multifactorial assessment of the ability to
return to sport is based on the patient’s perception of
readiness to return to sport, satisfaction with functional use
and outcome, resolution of impairments, and physical
performance of sport activity.
Patient Self-Report Outcomes
Information regarding the patient’s perception of symp-
toms and use of the shoulder is provided by PROs. One
limitation is that not all PRO instruments have a section or
focus on shoulder injuries related to sport or return to sport.
Commonly used PRO instruments for patients with SLAP
lesions are as follows:
(1) American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) self-
report form, which has 11 items to assess pain and
function (0–100, 100 ¼ full function)128
(2) University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA)
Shoulder Rating scale, which has 5 items to assess
pain, function, strength, ROM, and satisfaction and
incorporates both subjective and objective components
(0–35, 35 ¼ full function)129
(3) Shoulder Rating Questionnaire, also known as the
L’Insalata Questionnaire, which uses 21 items that
assess pain, daily activities, global assessment, recre-
ational and athletic activities, work, and satisfaction to
identify what is most important to the patient for
improvement (17–100, 100 ¼ full function)130
Journal of Athletic Training
217
 (4) Western Ontario Shoulder Instability Index, which was
developed for patients with shoulder instability and
uses 21 questions to assess physical symptoms; sport,
recreation, and work; lifestyle; and emotions (0–2100
or converted to 0–100, 100 ¼ full function)131
(5) Kerlan-Jobe Orthopedic Clinic questionnaire (KJOC),
which uses 10 physical function questions to assess
function during sport participation (0–100, 100 ¼ full
function)132
(6) Constant-Murley Shoulder Score, which incorporates
both subjective and objective assessments with 4
subscales of pain, function, ROM, and strength (0–
100, 100 ¼ full function)133
(7) Single Assessment Numeric Evaluation score, also
known as the global rating of function, which asks the
patient to rate the shoulder as a percentage of normal
function (0–100, 100 ¼ normal, full use of the
shoulder)134
Patient satisfaction with the outcome after an intervention
is commonly evaluated, yet no standard format is used to
measure satisfaction. Many authors selected a question
from the UCLA scale, which asks whether the patient is
satisfied, whereas others used a variation of a general
question regarding satisfaction with the surgery.
Outcomes Scores With Surgical or Nonoperative
Management
The inconsistent use of PROs across studies did not allow
outcomes to be collapsed on a single PRO. The reviewed
studies combined for operative and nonoperative manage-
ment indicated that shoulder function via PRO assessment
was high, with reports of 70% to 97% of full function at
long-term follow-up (Table 3). With nonoperative man-
agement, 1 study8 indicated very high PRO shoulder scores
(85%–92%, 100% ¼ full function), and only 5% did not
return to sport. However, a second study9 of professional
baseball players showed that most players (60.3%) were
unable to return to professional baseball after nonoperative
management. Both studies were retrospective.
At 2 to 4 years after SLAP repair, the majority of athletes
were able to return to their sport and demonstrated average
PRO scores of 85% for normal function, regardless of the
scale used. However, it is important to note that only the
KJOC scale was specifically designed to assess shoulder
function in overhead athletes. In the 3 studies36,45,59 that
used the KJOC as their PRO to assess the outcomes of
throwing athletes after SLAP repair, average function was
70% (range, 59%–77%). The level of function assessed
with non–athlete-specific scales may not adequately reflect
what is needed for return to sport. Another limitation of
most studies is the lack of information on when the PROs
were measured in these retrospective case series. Prospec-
tive studies are needed to enroll consecutive athletes
undergoing nonoperative or operative treatment for SLAP
lesions so that we can adequately understand the outcomes
of care.
A summary of specific PROs after SLAP repairs follows:
(1) The most common PRO used to assess function was the
ASES. At 2 to 4 years, the average score was 85/100
points (85%).
(2) The UCLA scale was the second most commonly used,
and the average was 31/35 (89%).
(3) The Shoulder Rating Questionnaire average score at 2
to 4 years postoperatively was 88 points (85.5%).
(4) The ASES, Western Ontario Shoulder Instability
Index, and Single Assessment Numeric Evaluation
scores were used in a single study9 and demonstrated
similar overall functional scores of 80% to 90% for 179
active-duty military patients.
(5) The Constant-Murley shoulder score was 83/100 (83%)
at 3 years postsurgery in a single study.43
(6) The KJOC score was used in 3 studies36,45,59 and
ranged from 59 to 77 out of 100 points at 2 to 4 years
postoperatively. The KJOC scores describe a lower
level of function because the instrument focuses on the
demands of an overhead athlete. This scale has
demonstrated the capability to discriminate between
overhead athletes performing without pain, those
performing with pain, and those unable to per-
form.132,135 This makes the KJOC a good scale to use
in determining readiness to return in overhead athletes.
Satisfaction levels were not reported with nonoperative
care. Satisfaction with outcomes reported in 13 of the 22
studies of operative management of SLAP lesions was high,
with 78% 6 18% of patients reporting an excellent level of
satisfaction at an average follow-up of 34 6 8 months. This
finding is quite similar to the 83% satisfaction score in a
systematic review of type II SLAP repairs by Sayde et al,11
who evaluated surgical outcomes published from 1950 to
2010. Their results and those of the prior systematic review
indicate that it is reasonable to expect the large majority of
athletes to be satisfied with their outcomes after SLAP
repair. However, overall satisfaction appeared to be lower
in overhead athletes. In 8 studies,4,36,45,49,51,59,62,65 only 68%
6 17% of overhead athletes reported an excellent level of
satisfaction at follow-up. The athlete’s demands need to be
taken into consideration regarding the level of satisfaction
after a SLAP repair. The athlete’s assessment should
include a PRO; although several instruments have been
used to date, the only one specifically evaluating short-term
and long-term outcomes in overhead athletes is the KJOC.67
Resolution of Impairments
Postoperative ROM was compared with preoperative
values or the opposite-shoulder values in only 4 stud-
ies.53,56,58,60 In a mix of 48 laborers and athletes at 41
months, flexion (208), abduction (238), IR (1 spinal level),
and ER (68) improved significantly.58 These results are
contrary to the findings of 2 studies that showed significant
reductions postoperatively for shoulder flexion (58) and
abduction (158)60 and a loss of IR (�1 vertebral level)53 in
20/33 (61%) patients at long-term follow-up. Yung et al56
reported that by 6 months, 14/16 (88%) patients had full
shoulder motion as measured on the UCLA scale. In the
overhead athlete, total arc of motion is a key measurement.
Values of approximately 1258 to 1308 of ER and
approximately 508 of IR are typically reported in high
school21,23 and professional baseball players.64 Provencher
et al,60 who evaluated active military patients, observed
postoperative values of approximately 858 of ER and 608 of
IR, which may be adequate for this population but not for a
throwing athlete. Limited and inconsistent evidence
218
Volume 53 � Number 3 � March 2018
 suggested that ROM recovers after a SLAP repair, but it is
important to note that ROM measures were not taken
sequentially over the course of recovery to determine when
normal motion was restored. Future authors should track
ROM values over the course of recovery to provide
milestones and a prognosis to the patient regarding the
expected amount of and time frame for return of ROM.
Strength was reported in only 2 studies43,58 after SLAP
repair. No differences were found in shoulder-flexion or
elbow-flexion strength between those treated with a biceps
tenodesis versus a SLAP repair.43 Compared with the
opposite arm, small losses were seen in both shoulder-
flexion and ER strength postsurgery.58 The recommended
strength criterion to start functional exercises and an
interval return-to-sport program is �70% of the contralat-
eral arm.64 Values greater than or equal to 80% of the
preinjury number of push-ups or pull-ups have been
suggested before a return to full military duty.61 However,
the current literature does not provide evidence-based
strength values for clinical progression and return to sport.
Additional testing (ie, isokinetics, Functional Movement
Screen, or upper extremity Y-balance test) may inform
clinical decision making, but evidence to determine the
usefulness of additional functional testing for return to sport
is not yet available.
Criteria to Return to Sport
Time-based criteria are commonly used to progress
athletes to sport-specific training. At approximately 4
months postoperatively, an interval throwing program and
sport-specific activities can be started. From months 4 to 6,
progressive demands on the shoulder continue with the goal
of resuming full sport activity at about 6 months. One
study61 of active military patients identified 4 specific
criteria for a return to military duty: (1) greater than 80% of
preoperative motion regained, (2) greater than 80% of
preoperative strength regained (measured by the self-
reported number of push-ups or pull-ups), (3) ability to
perform the physical requirements of the patient’s military
occupational specialty (which varied widely depending on
the job), and (4) full participation in overhead sport after 6
months. On average, patients returned to military duty in
4.4 months (range, 2–7 months) after SLAP repair. In a
retrospective review,59 30 overhead athletes participating in
baseball, softball, tennis, or javelin required a mean of 11.7
months (range, 6–18 months) for 24/30 (80%) to return to
some level of sport participation; unfortunately, the level
was not clearly reported. Among 13 overhead athletes, 2
nonoverhead athletes, and 1 nonathlete with isolated type II
SLAP tears, 11/16 returned to their preinjury level within
an average of 7 months; however, 4 patients described as
being involved in intense and frequent overhead activities
required an average of 11 months to return to their
preinjury level and 1 elite handball player never returned
to the preinjury level.56 The time to return can be quite
variable. Although protocols suggest that sport activities
can resume in 6 months, a longer time period is likely
required for a full return to sport after a SLAP repair.
An interval return-to-sport protocol should be used for
progression. Multiple programs have been described for
throwers.64,136�138 Volume and distance need to be
considered in the throwing program. The total volume
varies depending on the athlete’s sport and his or her role
on the team. The type of sport and position played in the
sport should also be taken into account when developing an
interval return-to-sport program, but no current evidence
has demonstrated the effectiveness of 1 progression
compared with another. The program depends on the
individual athlete and the clinician’s ability to blend the
science and art of rehabilitation. Programs for returning a
throwing athlete with a SLAP tear to competition vary
widely. Research is needed to compare the efficacy of
different throwing programs and progressions to establish a
standard of care relating to return-to-play criteria for the
overhead athlete.
Return to Sport or Work
The level of return to sport participation is not uniformly
reported or defined in the literature. Some authors36,132 have
categorized the level of return to sport based on the ability
to participate with or without pain or the inability to
participate. Another approach devised for baseball athletes
was to describe whether the athlete was able to return to a
higher, the same, or a lower level of participation or had
retired.65 We used a 3-level categorization to more clearly
represent the level of recovery when adequate information
is provided: (1) able to return to the preinjury level of sport
or better (indicating forward movement in the career, such
as from minor to major league baseball), (2) able to return
to sport but at a lower level or with occasional pain in the
shoulder (indicating a return to sport with limitations), or
(3) not able to return to sport activity at all.
Two retrospective case series8,9 of nonoperative treat-
ment of patients with SLAP lesions have been published. In
a mixed group of athletes (n ¼ 107), 89% returned to
functional activities within 6 months, and overall, 95% had
returned to their sport by 3 years. Among the sample, 67%
were overhead athletes and were able to return to the same
level of sport participation.8 However, the return to sport
for professional baseball players undergoing nonoperative
care was not impressive. In a retrospective study of
professional baseball players,9 the majority of players
(60.3%) were not able to return to professional baseball
after 2 trials of nonoperative management for a SLAP tear.
Among pitchers, 18/45 (40%) returned to sport, but only
10/45 (22%) were able to return to their prior performance
level; 60% of pitchers eventually sought surgical interven-
tion. Of the 23 position players, 9 (39%) returned to sport, 6
(26%) returned to their prior performance level, and 1 (4%)
retired; 56% eventually underwent surgical intervention for
their SLAP lesion.9
Return-to-sport rates vary widely after operative treat-
ment for SLAP lesions. Gorantla et al10 reported that 20%
to 94% of athletes were able to return to their preinjury
level of sport. Recovery was most challenging for overhead
athletes, as only 64% were able to return to sport. In a
subsequent systematic review11 of 506 patients (including
198 overhead athletes, 81 of whom were baseball players),
return to the preinjury level averaged 73% (range, 20%–
94%) for overhead athletes and 63% (range, 22%–92%) for
baseball players. We evaluated many of the same articles
plus 6 articles that were not included in the most recent
systematic review. Collapsing the results of return to play

 levels and nonathletes showed that 55% 6 17% returned to
the preinjury level or better, 31% 6 17% returned to sport
but at a lower level or with pain, and 18% 6 13% were not
able to return to sport. For the 6/13 studies of overhead
athletes, 45% 6 19% returned to the preinjury level or
better, 34% 6 22% returned to sport but at a lower level or
with pain, and 24% 6 15% were not able to return to sport.
A recent systematic review12 indicated that the odds of a
full return to overhead sport after an isolated SLAP lesion
repair were 0.2 to 3.0. Specifically, overhead athletes and
throwers had a 2.3 to 6 times greater chance of returning to
full activity than nonoverhead, nonthrowing athletes. The
wide variations in reported return rates are most likely
related to the lack of standardized return-to-play criteria in
the literature.
In summary, the literature poorly documents outcomes
and return-to-play criteria for athletes with type II SLAP
lesions. No level 1 or 2 studies have provided data
regarding return to play in the literature, and most studies
were level 4 (case series). Patient-reported outcomes for
function and satisfaction were at relatively high levels:
whether patients were managed nonoperatively or opera-
tively, they regained approximately 80% of normal
function, and 78% were satisfied 2 to 4 years after SLAP
repair. However, these results were not correlated with the
ability to return to sport, as rates for return to full sport
participation ranged from 45% to 55%. Those with higher
levels of sport demand and overhead athletes in general
appeared to have worse outcomes and lower rates of return
to sport. Most patients require about 6 months to return to
play, and throwers may require 9 to 12 months. To
adequately and systematically assess outcomes, we need
consistent reporting of the type of treatment used, patient
outcomes, and the time to and level of return to play.67
