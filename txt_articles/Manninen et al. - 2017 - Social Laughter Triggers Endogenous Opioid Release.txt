The size of human social networks significantly exceeds the network that can be maintained by social grooming or touching in other
primates. It has been proposed that endogenous opioid release after social laughter would provide a neurochemical pathway supporting
long-term relationships in humans (Dunbar, 2012), yet this hypothesis currently lacks direct neurophysiological support. We used PET
and the �-opioid-receptor (MOR)-specific ligand [11C]carfentanil to quantify laughter-induced endogenous opioid release in 12 healthy
males.Beforethesociallaughterscan,thesubjectswatchedlaughter-inducingcomedyclipswiththeirclosefriendsfor30min.Beforethe

versus non-laughter-inducing drama in groups. Modulation of the opioidergic activity by social laughter may be an important neuro-
chemical pathway that supports the formation, reinforcement, and maintenance of human social bonds.

Introduction
Humans and other primates use social touching or grooming for
reinforcing social structures (Dunbar and Shultz, 2010; Suvilehto
et al., 2015). Because blockade of opioid receptors stimulates
grooming and social behavior in primates (Meller et al., 1980;
Fabre-Nys et al., 1982), it has been proposed that touching-
dependent modulation of the �-opioid-receptor (MOR) system
might support maintenance of social bonds. However, because
the size of human social networks exceeds the network that can be
maintained by dyadic social touching (Dunbar, 2012), it has been
proposed that other means such as social laughter have evolved to
release endogenous opioids just as grooming does. Because social
laughter could allow simultaneous opioid release among all the
members of an interacting group, it might play a critical role in

Significance Statement
Socialcontactsarevitaltohumans.Thesizeofhumansocialnetworkssignificantlyexceedsthenetworkthatcanbemaintainedby
social grooming in other primates. Here, we used PET to show that endogenous opioid release after social laughter may provide a
neurochemical mechanism supporting long-term relationships in humans. Participants were scanned twice: after a 30 min social
laughter session and after spending 30 min alone in the testing room (baseline). Endogenous opioid release was stronger after
laughter versus the baseline scan. Opioid receptor density in the frontal cortex predicted social laughter rates. Modulation of the
opioidergic activity by social laughter may be an important neurochemical mechanism reinforcing and maintaining social bonds
between humans.

 enabling humans to live in exceptionally large social networks
(Dunbar, 2012). However, the neurochemical basis of human
social laughter remains poorly understood.
The MORs mediate the effects of endogenous and exogenous
opioids contributing to the rewarding effects of food and drugs
(Henriksen and Willoch, 2008; Nummenmaa and Tuominen, in
press). Endogenous opioids modulate prosocial behavior in po-
lygamous rodents (Panksepp et al., 1980) and MOR gene-knock-
out mice pups display deficits in attachment behavior (Moles et
al., 2004). Rhesus infants carrying a gain-of-function OPRM1
77G allele experience increased reward from maternal contact
and display increased measures of attachment (Barr et al., 2008),
whereas, in humans, A118G polymorphism of the OPRM1 is
associated with enhanced dispositional and neural sensitivity to
social rejection (Way et al., 2009). Consistent with these findings,
elevated cerebral MOR availability is associated with secure social
attachmentbehaviorinhumans(Nummenmaaetal.,2015).Finally,
opioid receptor antagonists increase the frequency of grooming
(Fabre-Nys et al., 1982) and grooming solicitations (Keverne et al.,
1989)inprimates,addingtotheevidencethattheopioidsystemmay
underlie social bonding.
Grooming-based social bonding imposes severe constraints
on the maximum possible size of social groups (Dunbar, 1991).
Therefore, ecological pressures demanding larger group sizes
have led to the evolution of more effective mechanisms for facil-
itating social bonding (Dunbar, 2008). Laughter is a universally
recognized expression of positive social emotion, occurring most
frequently in human social interactions (Sauter et al., 2010; Scott et
al., 2014) but is also present in nonhuman primates (Preuschoft,
1992; Davila Ross et al., 2009). Humans volitionally laugh as an
expression of prosociality, possibly for bonding purposes (Scott et
al., 2014), and shared sense of humor is indeed a strong predictor of
affiliationandaltruism(CurryandDunbar,2013).Becauselaughter
is highly contagious (Provine, 2004), it would allow MOR responses
to spread throughout the interacting group to increase the effective-
ness of this type of “vocal grooming” (Dunbar, 2012).
Here we tested directly whether social laughter results in cerebral
opioid release, as quantified with in vivo PET. Measures of MOR
availability were acquired with the MOR-specific ligand [11C]car-
fentanil during two separate sessions: social laughter and a neutral
baseline condition. Under this experimental design, endogenous
opioid release would be manifested as lower [11C]carfentanil bind-
ing potential (the ratio of specific to nondisplaceable binding in the
brain, BPND) in the social laughter versus baseline condition. Build-
ing on animal research on grooming-dependent MOR activation,
we expected to see significantly increased MOR activation in the
social laughter condition.
Materials and Methods
Subjects and self-reports. The study protocol was approved by the ethics
board of the Hospital District of Southwest Finland and the study was
conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Twelve
healthy male adults (age range 20–32 years, mean � 22.9, SD � 3.26)
volunteered for the study. Only young males were scanned because age
and sex influence both MOR availability and the capacity to engage the
MOR system (Gabilondo et al., 1995; Zubieta et al., 1999). In addition to
standard PET and MRI exclusion criteria, subjects were excluded if they
met any of the following criteria: poor compliance, smoking, excessive
alcohol consumption (� 8 units/week), use of illicit drugs, current med-
ication affecting the CNS, or a history of or current neurological or
psychiatric disease confirmed using the structured clinical interview for
DSM-IV, medical history, and blood tests. Subjects were compensated
for their time and travel costs and they signed ethics-committee-
approved informed consent forms. Subjects reported their mood (sleep-
iness, happiness, tension, irritability, pain, pleasure, calmness, and
amusement) using a visual analog scale (range 0–100). Responses were
recorded at the beginning (0 min; immediately after the laughter/base-
line manipulation), in the middle (27 min), and at the end (51 min) of the
PET scans (see below).
Social laughter manipulation. Each subject underwent two PET scans
on the same day: a social laughter scan and a neutral baseline scan. Before
the social laughter scan, the subject and his two close friends watched
preselected comedy clips together for 30 min in a private room. Subjects
were seated in front of a data projector screen and given access to a
computer with a preselected playlist of short, amusing comedy clips on
YouTube. They were then asked to watch the clips similarly as they would
be watching TV. A similar protocol has been validated previously to
trigger social laughter reliably (Dunbar et al., 2012). Social laughter ma-
nipulation was performed before rather than during the PET scan to
avoid laughing-related head and other bodily movements during data
acquisition. Before the baseline scan, the subjects spent 30 min alone in
the preparation room without contacts with other individuals.
During prescan laughter manipulation, the sounds of social laughter
were recorded with an Olympus Digital Recorder VN-711PC. The re-
corder was placed in the middle of the room and the microphone was
aimed at the subjects. Subsequently, frequency of laughter bursts was
coded from the recordings. Two laughter bursts were considered as dis-
tinct if they were separated by at least 3 s of silence. Nonspecific sounds,
such as humming, coughing, or amused speaking were not considered as
laughs. Because this laughter measure did not differentiate between
laughter of the scanned subject versus the two accompanying subjects,
the subjects also reported, on a laughter-rate-scale ranging from 0 to 100,
how much they thought they laughed throughout the session.
PET data acquisition and analysis. PET scans immediately followed the
laughter and baseline conditions. During the PET acquisition, the subject
was lying in the PET scanner wearing hospital clothes and covered with
blankets. The lights in the scanner room were dimmed. Social laughter
and baseline conditions were separated by a 2 h break to allow for tracer
decay. The order of the scans was counterbalanced across subjects.
Data were acquired with Philips Ingenuity PET-MR scanner at Turku
PET Centre. Radiotracer production has been described previously (Hir-
vonen et al., 2009; Karlsson et al., 2015). After intravenous (M � 250
MBq, SD � 28 MBq) radioligand (mean injected mass 0.34 �g) bolus
injection, radioactivity in the brain was measured with the PET camera
for 51 min with an in-plane resolution of 3.75 mm. The subjects were
lying in a supine position throughout the studies. Data were corrected for
dead time, decay, and measured photon attenuation and dynamic PET
scans were reconstructed using the MRP reconstruction method (Ale-
nius and Ruotsalainen, 1997). High-resolution (1 mm 3) anatomical MR
reference images were acquired using a T1-weighted sequence (TR 25 ms,
TE 4.6 ms, flip angle 30°, scan time 376 s).
To correct for head motion, dynamic PET images were first realigned
frame to frame. The individual T1-weighted MR images were coregis-
tered to the summation images calculated from the realigned frames.
Reference regions were drawn manually on MRI images using PMOD 3.4
software (PMOD Technologies). Receptor availability was expressed in
terms of BPND. We used the occipital cortex as the reference region
because it is known to be practically devoid of MOR (Hiller and Fan,
1996). BPND was calculated for each voxel using the simplified reference
tissue model with reference-tissue time activity curves as input data
(Gunn et al., 1997). This outcome measure is not confounded by blood
flow or tracer transport (Sander et al., 2014). The subject-wise parametric
BPND images were normalized to MNI space using the T1-weighted MR
images and smoothed with a Gaussian kernel of 8 mm FWHM.
The effects of social laughter on MOR availability were then assessed in
SPM12 (http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/) using a repeated-measures t
test. Statistical threshold was set at p � 0.05, FDR corrected at cluster
level. Effect size maps (Cohen’s d) were also computed to allow visual
inspection of the magnitude of the observed BPND changes. Linear re-
gression analysis was further used to test whether baseline MOR avail-
ability would be associated with social laughter rate in the laughter
manipulation. In a complementary approach, we also computed and
visualized these associations in anatomical regions of interest (ROIs)

 generated in key components of the reward circuit and regions critical for
socioemotional processing (thalamus, ventral striatum, dorsal caudate,
amygdala, insula, orbitofrontal cortex, and anterior, medial, and poste-
rior cingulate cortices) delineated using the AAL (Tzourio-Mazoyer et
al., 2002) and Anatomy toolboxes (Eickhoff et al., 2005). Striatal divi-
sions were performed manually as described previously (Ka
¨tsyri et al.,
2013).
Results
Viewing the comedy clips successfully elicited group laughter,
with a mean rate of 1.04 (SD � 0.60) recorded laughter bursts per
minute. The objective group laughter rate also correlated signif-
icantly with subjects’ self-reported laughter rate (M � 61, SD �
21 rs � 0.57, p � 0.05). Self-reports revealed that social laughter
led to increased experience of amusement and calmness at the
beginning (p � 0.05), but not at the midpoint or endpoint of the
scans (Fig. 1). Whole-brain analysis of the PET data revealed that
social laughter increased endogenous opioid release (as reflected
by decreased [ 11C]carfentanil BPND) in several brain regions in-
cluding thalamus, caudate nucleus and putamen, and the insular,
cingulate, and frontal cortices. Opposite effects were observed in
middle cingulate cortices (see Fig. 2 for effect size and t-contrast
maps).
Because MOR tone is known to be positively associated with
self-reported sociability, we next tested whether baseline MOR
availability would predict the frequency of social laughter bursts
in the pre-experimental manipulation. Full-volume analyses
(Fig. 3) revealed widespread positive associations, most pro-
foundly observed in orbitofrontal and cingulate cortices and in
the ventral striatum. Analysis based on the self-reported laughter
scores yielded essentially a similar pattern of results (data not
shown). Results from anatomical ROI analyses (Fig. 4) paralleled
those of the full-volume analyses, with significant associations (r 2
� 0.38, p � 0.05) observed in anterior, middle, and posterior
cingulate cortices, orbitofrontal cortex, and ventral striatum.
Because we scanned only males and used a low-level baseline
condition (spending 30 min alone in the control room), the data
do not show conclusively that social laughter per se would have
triggered the observed endogenous opioid release and that this
effect would occur in both sexes. To control for these issues, we
reanalyzed our previous data (Dunbar et al., 2012) on the effects
of social laughter on pain thresholds (as a proxy for endogenous
opioid release). In this study, male and female subjects viewed
either live comedy or drama and performed a “wall-sit” exercise
as a pain threshold assay 1 h before and immediately after the
comedy/drama shows. In this task, the
subjects lean against a wall with legs at
right angles until it becomes too painful
and they collapse to the ground. The re-
analysis revealed that the pain threshold
was significantly higher in the (laughter-
inducing) comedy versus drama condi-
tion (t(29) � 2.54, p � 0.017), suggesting
that laughter and not the mere social pres-
ence of others is necessary for the endog-
enous opioid release. Importantly, there
was no difference between pain threshold
change between males and females (p �
0.93, Mmales � 49.3 � 16.0 s, Mfemales �
47.4 � 10.3 s).
Because laughter and subjective expe-
rience of pleasure were not recorded di-
rectly in the above study, we also ran a new
control experiment (19 females, 24 males)
in which we measured laughter rates and acquired subjective
ratings of amusement from male and female subjects while they
viewed 30 min medleys of comedy movies versus neutral movie
clips, similar to the main experiment. Laughter rate (F(1,39) �
14.83, p � 0.001, �p
2 � 0.28) and subjective experience of
amusement (F(1,39) � 7.62, p � 0.01, �p
2 � 0.16) were signifi-
cantly higher in the comedy versus neutral movie conditions,
and there were no differences between male and female subjects
(p � 0.47).
Discussion
Our results demonstrate for the first time that social laughter is
associated with MOR system activation and that baseline MOR
availability specifically predicts the amount of experimentally in-
duced social laughter. Laughter triggered endogenous opioid re-
lease in brain regions involved in processing of rewards and
arousal (thalamus, caudate nucleus), but also in the insular cor-
tices that have been associated with interoceptive, gustatory, and
nociceptive processing (Wicker et al., 2003; Critchley et al., 2004;
Singer et al., 2004). Our results show that social laughter triggers
endogenous opioid release, which could provide a powerful
way for modulating social bonds in groups. Together, these
results suggest that the opioid system plays a key role in mam-
malian prosocial communication and possibly also in social
bonding, in addition to the well known oxytocin and vaso-
pressin systems (Young et al., 2001).
Social laughter increased positive mood and calmness, in ac-
cordance with the anxiolytic effects of exogenous opioid agonists
(Colasanti et al., 2011). Laughter and positive facial expressions
are important prosocial signals in humans (Scott et al., 2014) and
alsoinnonhumanprimates.Macaquesandchimpanzeesuseaquiet,
smile-like gesture to appease aggressive conspecifics, whereas re-
laxed, open-mouth vocalizations are associated with both play be-
havior and pair formation (Preuschoft, 1992; Waller and Dunbar,
2005).Priorstudieshavefoundthatlaughterinvolvesengagementof
both affective and reward networks in the brain (Wild et al., 2003).
Therefore, we propose that laughter-evoked, coordinated MOR ac-
tivity in these systems could constitute a candidate neurochemical
mechanism underlying incentive motivation toward bonding. The
present results also agree with the general role of the endogenous
opioids in prosociality. For example, the opioid antagonist naltrex-
one increases self-reported pain ratings and unpleasant experiences
when seeing others in pain (Ru
¨tgen et al., 2015b). Placebo analgesia

which is also reflected as attenuated brain responses to seeing others
experiencing pain (Ru
¨tgen et al., 2015a; Ru
¨tgen et al., 2015b).
Our results parallel those stemming from pharmacological ma-
nipulation studies on the opioidergic basis of social grooming in
nonhumanprimates(Fabre-Nysetal.,1982;Gravesetal.,2002).Itis
thuspossiblethathumansociallaughtercouldsupportsimilarsocial
functions as grooming does in humans and other primates, that is
reducing tension (cf. self-report data) and anxiety-related behaviors
(Graves et al., 2002), also including establishing and maintaining
socialstructures(DunbarandShultz,2010;Suvilehtoetal.,2015).In
agreement with these findings, significant laughter-induced MOR
activation was also observed in the anterior insula. The unmyeliated
C-tactile fibers project to the insula, but not to the primary somato-
sensory cortices (Olausson et al., 2002), and this tactile system re-
sponding to slow, pleasurable stroking may provide the sensory
pathway for emotional and affiliative touching. Along with prior
functional imaging studies showing insula activation while subjects
listen to vocal laughter bursts (Sander and Scheich, 2005), our data
supporttheclaimthatsociallaughtermayengagethesameaffective–
sensory circuits as does physical grooming, which is consistent with
Darwin’s original proposal that laughter is a kind of “tickling of the
mind” (Darwin, 1872).
Surprisingly, we also observed decreased laughter-triggered
opioid activity in the cortical midline regions. Although such
observations are not uncommon in studies with [ 11C]carfentanil
(Hsu et al., 2013), their interpretation is not straightforward.
Decrease in BPND may result from externalization or conforma-
tional changes in the receptors, but whether it is caused by increased
or decreased endogenous opioid tone cannot be determined within
the current design.
Unlike grooming, social laughter allows engagement of the
MOR-dependent bonding mechanism among all members of an
interacting group. Laughter is highly contagious and, in an ap-

Manninen et al. • Social Laughter Triggers Endogenous Opioid Release
 propriately pleasurable context, simply hearing the sound of
laughing may be sufficient to trigger laughter (Provine, 2004).
This, in turn, may engage the MOR system of all individuals in the
group hearing the laughter. Therefore, laughter imposes less se-
vere timing constraints on social bonding compared with groom-
ing and it could thus play a key role in enabling humans to live in
exceptionally large social networks with numerous affiliative and
nonreproductive relationships (Dunbar, 2012). Such laughter-
based bonding mechanisms are functional very early on during hu-
mandevelopment;spontaneouslaughterandsmilesaretheveryfirst
prosocialgesturesthatinfantsdirecttowardtheircaregivers.Because
the occurrence of infant smiles is strongly related to the caregiver’s
positive emotions (Mireault et al., 2015), laughter and smiling are
thought to reflect coordinated bonding behavior within the infant–
caregiver dyad. Due to the spreading of the opioidergic response
across listeners, social laughter likely plays a major role in early so-
cialization of the infant to their family and their proximal social
networks, as well as directly underpinning the mother–infant bond.
However, we stress that our data pertain strictly to laughter-induced
opioid release and, even though this parallels the well known effects
of opioids on social bonding in other primates, further work is re-
quired to establish causal relationships between laughter-induced
opioid release and social bonding.
Baseline MOR availability predicts the rate of social laughter
Baseline MOR availability predicted linearly the rate of social
laughter during the experimental laughter manipulation. This
effect was observed in the key nodes of the reward circuit
(amygdala and ventral striatum) and in the frontal and cingulate
cortices supporting socioemotional func-
tions. These results provide direct evi-
dence for the hypotheses that MOR
availability is associated with sociability
and
reward-sensitivity,
as
indicated
previously by correlational PET studies
(Nummenmaa et al., 2015). Importantly,
full-volume analysis also revealed an associ-
ationbetweenlaughterrateandMORavail-
ability in the amygdala. The role of the
amygdala in nonverbal emotional process-
ing is well established (Sander and Scheich,
2005) and functional neuroimaging studies
have shown that the amygdala is involved in
involuntary (emotional) but not voluntary
laughter(Wildetal.,2003;Scottetal.,2014).
High availability of MORs may enhance the
calming effects of endogenously released
opioid peptides acting on the MOR during
social laughter, thus promoting reinforce-
ment of attachment bonds. Genetically
determined individual differences in opioi-
dergic neurotransmission influence social
behavior(Molesetal.,2004;Barretal.,2008;
Way et al., 2009). It is therefore likely that
genetically determined MOR expression
contributessignificantlytothiseffect;none-
theless, neuroplastic changes in the MOR
system after repeated exposures to pleasur-
able social interaction likely play a role too.
Humans have an urgent need to feel
like they belong to groups and most stud-
ies have shown that both large social net-
works and the availability of social
support are associated with beneficial effects for somatic health in
humans (Broadhead et al., 1983; Liu and Newschaffer, 2011;
Holt-Lunstad et al., 2015) and with infant survival in monkeys
(Silk et al., 2003). Prior studies also suggest that such laughter-
dependent effects on somatic health occur already at the level of
the immune system. Social laughter releases immunoenhancers
(such as �-endorphins), but it also increases the activity of natu-
ral killer cells (lymphocytes) and lowers cortisol levels in blood
circulation (Berk et al., 1989). Because both the tendency to avoid
intimate social interactions (Nummenmaa et al., 2015) and the
occurrence of mood disorders are associated with lower regional
availability of MOR (Kennedy et al., 2006), the present data show
that laughter may not only be an important mechanism for main-
taining social relationships, but also an effective behavioral cop-
ing mechanism against stressful situations.
Limitations
It must be noted that the observed BPND changes may also reflect
receptor internalization or altered conformation rather than oc-
cupancy by endogenous neurotransmitter. Our outcome mea-
sure (BPND) cannot specify directly which interpretation is most
appropriate. Moreover, because we scanned only males, we do
not know whether our results translate directly to females. How-
ever, our behavioral control data showing elevated pain threshold
when watching comedy versus drama clips together with friends
suggest that laughter likely triggers similar opioid release in fe-
male subjects. To maximize statistical power, our study used a
highly natural laughter manipulation coupled with a low-level
baseline condition (i.e., spending 30 min alone before the scan);

all observations suggest that no single data point or removal of such drives the correlations significantly.

 therefore, it can be questioned whether our results would be spe-
cific to social laughter versus the mere social presence of others.
However, our behavioral control data suggest that only social
laughter rather than mere social presence of other individuals (or
pleasure, see Dunbar et al., 2012) leads to endogenous opioid
release. Finally, due to limited sample size, this first in vivo dem-
onstration of laughter-induced opioid release should be consid-
ered as preliminary and interpreted with some caution.
Conclusions
We conclude that baseline level and modulation of the �-opioid
system by social laughter could be an important neurochemical
mechanism reinforcing and maintaining social bonds between
humans. These data agree with animal studies (Keverne et al.,
1989) in suggesting that the calming effects of endogenous opi-
oidergic activity during social interactions constitute a key mech-
anism promoting intragroup affiliation and bonding. Social
touching and grooming are important means for bonding in hu-
mans and other primates (Dunbar and Shultz, 2010; Suvilehto et
al., 2015); however, the present findings underline the central
role of nonverbal communication and laughter in modulating
interpersonal bonds and making large social networks possible.
